<h1 class="hidetitle">You Don't Know Jack about Bandwidth</h1>
<h2>If you're an ISP and all your customers hate you, take heart. This is now a solvable problem.</h2>
<h3>David Collier-Brown</h3>
<p>Imagine you're a company with a lot of work-from-home employees, and they all hate the local ISPs. Videoconferences are the worst: People can't hear each other, they randomly start sounding like Darth Vader, and they occasionally just disappear from the conversation.</p>
<p>Or you're a small ISP and your <i>customers</i> say they hate you.</p>
<p>When you talk to your ISP or supplier, they say, "Buy more bandwidth." When your customers complain to their ISP, they get told the same thing. But when you measure how much bandwidth you're using at the busiest part of the day, it's 30 or 50 percent.</p>
<p>In a sense, the suppliers are right: Bandwidth really is the "diameter of the pipe" between you and your employees or customers. If it is too small, you really <i>will</i> get slowed down.</p>
<p>Once you're not filling the pipe, though, when you're only 50 percent busy, you need to look at the software and see what is keeping your packets from arriving in a reasonable time. For example, I once measured the time to send a "ping" to downtown Toronto from my home office in the suburbs. It took 0.13 seconds to get downtown and back. That's the normal ping time for Istanbul, Turkey, roughly 8,000 km away (<a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings/Toronto/Istanbul">https://wondernetwork.com/pings/Toronto/Istanbul</a>).</p>
<p>That's a pure software problem, and it's called <i>high latency</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bandwidth is How Much, Latency is How Slow</h3>
<p>If you think of the Internet as a series of pipes, the bandwidth is how much data you can send down the pipe. It's the diameter, in figure 1.</p>
<img src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3674953/assets/html/collierbrown1.png" alt="You Dont Know Jack about Bandwidth" />
<p>If you buy a narrow, little pipe, you absolutely will have bad performance: You won't be able to get all your data through it in any reasonable amount of time. You'll have starved yourself.</p>
<p>If you buy a pipe big enough to contain your data, you're fine. The data will all flow straight down the pipe instead of having to sit around waiting for the previous bytes to squeeze their way into the pipe.</p>
<p>If you buy a pipe twice the diameter you need, though, it won't help. Your data will still flow into it without delay, but it won't go any faster. It will not exceed the speed of light. There's no "warp speed" available for the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>But Why is it Slow?</h3>
<p>The latency is how quickly (or slowly) the data shows up. The least latency you can have equals the length of the pipe divided by the speed of light.</p>
<p>Consider an outgoing Zoom call. It's a bunch of short snippets of picture and sound, nicely compressed, with a period of time between each, as shown in figure 2.</p>
<img src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3674953/assets/html/collierbrown2.png" alt="You Dont Know Jack about Bandwidth" />
<p>Each little slice of audio and video shoots through the pipe by itself, leaving room for other slices. For a Zoom call to fail, you need a lot of other traffic at the same time, enough to fill up the pipe: If you're working from home, this could mean someone in your family is streaming a movie or uploading photos from a cell phone.</p>
<p>That causes <i>contention</i>, shown in figure 3, where the photos (the big, long slice at the top) elbow their way into the pipe ahead of the little Zoom slices.</p>
<img src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3674953/assets/html/collierbrown3.png" alt="You Dont Know Jack about Bandwidth" />
<p>If you have bad router software, the little Zoom slices will have to sit around in a queue (buffer) waiting until the photos finish. Because the Zoom slices are delayed, other people on the Zoom call may see you freeze or stutter. Sometimes you'll sound like you're shouting from the bottom of a well. On bad days, you'll just drop out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bad Router Software</h3>
<p>In the home, the problem is in the software on the home router, which connects to the wider Internet. The bug is called <i>bufferbloat,</i><sup>1</sup> as described by Phillipa Harrison in "Buffer-bloated Router? How to Prevent it and Improve Performance."<sup>2</sup> In this bug, the sender buffers up the photos and as soon as the network is available, sends them all. While doing that, it can't send the videoconferencing slices, so it delays them and sends them only after the photos complete.</p>
<p>That might be fine for computers, but humans discussing something need their words to come in the right order, without delays or interruptions. The photos should share the network fairly with the videoconference and not steal all the bandwidth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Good Router Software</h3>
<p>In the best of all possible worlds, every router on the Internet would be running software that has the latest changes to minimize latency, usually fq_codel or CAKE. Unfortunately, not everyone can update as often as they would like, and router manufacturers are often years behind on rewriting their proprietary operating systems to include the newest fixes. Some are even back at PIE, a <i>much</i> older predecessor to CAKE.</p>
<p>Home modem/router/Wi-Fi boxes are, if anything, worse. They get built, used, and thrown away when they die. They never get updated. The net result is a lot of old, buggy software on the Internet, and a lot of packets sitting in queues twiddling their thumbs as they wait for a chance to be sent.</p>
<p>Individuals took control of the problem by adding a smarter router between their home and their ISP's modem/router/Wi-Fi box. The smart router keeps the data flowing as fast as the pipe will allow, sending "I'm having contention" signals that the older software can understand when any of the machines in your home network send too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Fixing the ISP</h3>
<p>Adding devices to the home doesn't scale. If you're a company, you can't afford to buy a new home router for each of your employees. If you're an ISP, you can't just tear out painfully expensive core routers to install newer ones.</p>
<p>The answer is not to tear out routers but adapt the techniques used in the home. If your customers hate you, put a device with modern software in the path to your customers, downstream of your routers.</p>
<p>Such as device is dedicated only to dealing with buffering, bloat, and contention. That also keeps the price down, because an older single-socket Xeon with eight cores can handle 10 Gbps of traffic</p>
<p>The name of the software for the ISP device is LibreQoS (<a href="https://libreqos.io/">https://libreqos.io/</a>), where <i>QoS</i> means <i>quality of service</i>. It came out of the same team that pioneered the fq_codel and CAKE software that addressed the problem at the home-router end.</p>
<p>They looked at the problem from the Internet end and set out to help the ISPs and other companies that couldn't trivially buy more bandwidth, but instead had to make better use of what they had.</p>
<p>Their solution is to apply a complete suite of fixes to IP networking, which includes:</p>
<p>• Fair queuing</p>
<p>• Bandwidth shaping</p>
<p>• Active queue management</p>
<p>• Diffserv handling</p>
<p>• Ack filtering</p>
<p>• Network topology awareness</p>
<p>• Parallel processing</p>
<p>• Bypassing Linux bridge overheads </p>
<p>• Built-in round-trip-time measurement to show the improvement</p>
<p>All of these fixes work together to find the highest rate that doesn't overload the slowest part of the system. That means packets do not have to sit in a queue at the ISP, waiting for a chance to be sent, like the videoconferencing packets waiting at home for an image to finish uploading.</p>
<p>The first fixes are fair queuing and control of delay, from fq_codel.</p>
<p>CAKE then added Active Queue Management. AQM does the same kind of bandwidth probing that vanilla TCP does, but adds in-band congestion signaling to detect congestion as soon as possible. The transmission rate is slowly raised until a congestion signal is received, then reduced. Once reduced, it starts increasing again, continuously searching for the highest rate it can use without causing a queue to build up. The algorithm used is an extension of fq_codel.</p>
<p>The fairness component prevents particular flows from being starved of resources by other streams, like our photo example, or by hosts starting large numbers of streams to try stealing as much of the network bandwidth as they can.</p>
<p>Diffserv is a mechanism for labeling packets as interactive (high priority) through bulk (low priority), so bulk file transfer can be recognized and kept from delaying videoconferences. Related to this, but not part of diffserv itself, is an algorithm to detect and properly prioritize sparse flows, so <i>they</i> won't be starved.</p>
<p>Ack filtering entirely removes packets that are merely carrying an acknowledgment of received data, so long as there are enough non-empty packets flowing the same way to take over that task.</p>
<p>Next, we come to LibreQoS itself, which adds components specific to running at the ISP end of the network. The first component is a network topology tree, because an ISP will have many routes to their customers, each with its own maximum rate that has to be discovered and processed by its own instance of the flow-shaping code.</p>
<p>On top of this sits a hierarchical token bucket classifier that sorts the incoming packets into the correct CPU core and the correct "shaper" rule. The standard Linux shaper that CAKE uses is single-threaded and tends to run out of capacity above 6 Gbps. The LibreQoS shaper is limited only by the number and speed of the CPU cores and Ethernet cards.</p>
<p>LibreQoS 1.4 introduced a new fast Ethernet bridge, based on XDP (eXpress Data Path) and eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), to avoid bottlenecking on the <code>ksoftirqd</code> thread in the kernel.</p>
<p>When they were finished with the performance work, the LibreQoS crew added software to measure and manage the improvement: a new low-overhead <i>round-trip-time sensor</i>, a packet-capture system, and a suite of realtime programs to measure and visualize the performance of large numbers of routes and customers.</p>
<p>This is a mature technology and runs on ordinary equipment, such as an ISP might already have. As a concrete example, an ISP delivering 1Gb/s service plans to its customers and with up to 10Gb/s total throughput would need a CPU such as an Intel Xeon E-2388G with eight cores, 16 GB of memory, and a dual-port 10G Ethernet card—a very ordinary 1u-sized machine from 2021.</p>
<p>Now a company with bad performance can ask its ISP to fix it, and point at the software and people who have already used it. If the ISP already knows it has a performance complaint, it can get ahead of the problem by proactively implementing LibreQoS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>If you've already solved the problem with LibreQoS, you can see the fix happening in realtime. In figure 4, a customer is downloading Diablo 2 and Diablo 4 at the same time over a 100Mbps link. The link shows as completely saturated in the throughput graph, but the delay is tiny: 1.7 milliseconds with peaks to 3.1. Fair queuing keeps the delay below levels that humans or Zoom can detect.</p>

<p>It can also be measured from a home office if you're one of the happy people who have a debloated router. Using the Waveform Internet speed test at <a href="https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat">https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat</a>, my untreated connection to a local ISP got a "D" (figure 5) on its report card: not suitable for video gaming, videoconferencing, or even audio-only VoIP calls. And <i>badly</i> is exactly how it behaved until I put a debloated home router in front of the ISP's device.</p>
<img src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3674953/assets/html/collierbrown5.png" alt="You Dont Know Jack about Bandwidth" />
<p>Conversely, that same 150/15 Mbps connection with a debloated router resulted in an A+ grade, a less-bloated speed report, and in practice has been delivering excellent videoconference performance for several years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Bandwidth probably isn't the problem when your employees or customers say they have terrible Internet performance. Once they have something in the range of 50 to 100 Mbps, the problem is latency—how long it takes for the ISP's routers to process their traffic.</p>
<p>If you're an ISP and all your customers hate you, take heart. This is now a solvable problem, thanks to a dedicated band of individuals who hunted it down, killed it, and then proved out their solution in home routers.</p>

<br/>
Automatic onboarding of devices is an important technique to handle the increasing number of &quot;edge&quot; and IoT devices being installed. Onboarding of devices is different from most device-management functions because the device's trust transitions from the factory and supply chain to the target application. To speed the process with automatic onboarding, the trust relationship in the supply chain must be formalized in the device to allow the transition to be automated.

<br/>
Low latency is an important feature for many Google applications such as Search, and latency-analysis tools play a critical role in sustaining low latency at scale. For complex distributed systems that include services that constantly evolve in functionality and data, keeping overall latency to a minimum is a challenging task. In large, real-world distributed systems, existing tools such as RPC telemetry, CPU profiling, and distributed tracing are valuable to understand the subcomponents of the overall system, but are insufficient to perform end-to-end latency analyses in practice.

<br/>
The VPN (virtual private network) is 24 years old. The concept was created for a radically different Internet from the one we know today. As the Internet grew and changed, so did VPN users and applications. The VPN had an awkward adolescence in the Internet of the 2000s, interacting poorly with other widely popular abstractions. In the past decade the Internet has changed again, and this new Internet offers new uses for VPNs. The development of a radically new protocol, WireGuard, provides a technology on which to build these new VPNs.

<br/>
Incentives are crucial for the Bitcoin protocol&#8217;s security and effectively drive its daily operation. Miners go to extreme lengths to maximize their revenue and often find creative ways to do so that are sometimes at odds with the protocol. Cryptocurrency protocols should be placed on stronger foundations of incentives. There are many areas left to improve, ranging from the very basics of mining rewards and how they interact with the consensus mechanism, through the rewards in mining pools, and all the way to the transaction fee market itself.
