  <h1 class="hidetitle">No One Has Time to Work on Your Project</h1> 
  <h2>How to work effectively with overwhelmed people to get things done</h2> 
  <h3>Strata Chalup <span style="font-size:0.8em;font-weight:100">(standing in for Thomas A. Limoncelli)</span></h3> 
  <p>Imagine you're at a big tech company where people are rewarded for impact and initiative, and everyone is far too busy. Your job is to get people who have too much to do, don't report to you, and may not even be in your organization to work together to accomplish your project. </p> 
  <p>Yes, your project sounds mostly doomed. But wait! Mostly doomed is not entirely doomed. What if you could apply a few basic principles that would help make working on your project seem more attractive and worthwhile to people? I have been there and done that in big tech—with sysadmins, SREs (site reliability engineers), and software developers—for 30 years.</p> 
  <p>Success in these matters boils down to a few basic principles and assumptions that seem obvious and unremarkable. What makes them effective is when you manage to combine all of them and apply them consistently. Let's look at the basics and then elaborate from there. </p> 
  <h3>Context of the Situation </h3> 
  <h4>People are basically good— overworked and stressed, but good</h4> 
  <p>The vast majority of people you will deal with at work are fundamentally good. They may be more chaotic good sometimes than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">lawful or neutral good</a>, but they are not out to deliberately cause harm. In most cases, their only opinion about your project is that it's something else for them to do, and they already have too much to do.</p> 
  <p>Most people want to do a good job. Their definitions of what constitutes a good job will vary, but there are some common themes: They want to make steady progress toward a goal and cover their responsibilities toward that end; they want to see that their work leads to professionally or personally meaningful results; they want to be recognized for that work.</p> 
  <p>Yet, at most high-tech companies, people often feel they are not doing a good job and experience diminished job satisfaction. They have too many tasks, conflicting priorities, and pressure to deliver ever more with fewer resources.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h4>What is it like to operate under stressful conditions? </h4> 
  <p>The basic psychology of many overworked people is that they continually struggle with a sense of being overwhelmed, and they are paralyzed by the anxiety of having too much to do. Under such circumstances, it can be difficult to approach to-do lists in a rational manner. Often, many of the to-do items for these people require more uninterrupted time and concentration than they can manage in a typical workday. Yet, they want to feel as if they're contributing something to the common goal.</p> 
  <p>When someone is under duress, it can be difficult enough just to choose which item to pop off the to-do list. Most roadblocks come from some combination of not knowing exactly what's required to accomplish a task, not having a big enough chunk of time in which to perform the task, and not necessarily believing it's really all that important anyway. Some resistance arises from the belief the task will prove to be unpleasant, perhaps because of anticipated interaction with some specific coworker. More often, the problem lies in poorly planned tasks that are open ended, vague, or not time bound.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h4>What could make tasks more attractive? </h4> 
  <p>To make your tasks more attractive to other people, you need first and foremost to help them understand exactly what will be involved in accomplishing the work. That then will inform their estimate of how much time each task will require. They'll also need to understand why it needs to be done right now. If you can manage that and it turns out the task is actionable, won't take long, won't become an ongoing responsibility, and is arguably important, someone is more likely to willingly take it on.</p> 
  <p>Even if others have more important tasks to perform, when your item looks easy and attainable, it will be attractive to some people. Your item may even prove a confidence boost that will help them complete more difficult tasks. Of course, it could also become a procrastination task, giving people a way to occupy their time while avoiding harder work. Either way, your task will get done. You may be aware your colleagues have other priorities, but ultimately, you need to trust that they're capable of making choices that work for them. </p> 
  <p>With that said, be mindful that some of your tasks may be achievable because they represent work that is "too easy" for an engineer at that level. So, a career-minded engineer might actually need to be reminded of the importance of being impactful in a larger context. </p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h4>Don't neglect the human factors</h4> 
  <p>There is a personal component to all this as well. Often, people are looking for something that can give them immediate gratification or recognition. Your clearly defined small chunk of work could provide that quick dopamine hit. Some people are motivated by being recognized as an expert, which means that appealing to their sense of expertise can be a motivator. Additionally, experts tend to be more efficient at tasks within their purview, which adds to the achievability of the work. Finally, many people find it gratifying to work on an important project with someone who is likely to thank them for their contributions. </p> 
  <p>Which is to say, don't underestimate the value of being appreciative. Yes, your colleagues are only doing their job. But we are people, after all, and everyone likes to be noticed and appreciated. Thanking and recognizing people for working on your project will go a long way toward inclining them to work with you on future projects. Also remember that relationships with your colleagues are the key to effective collaboration. People notice which leaders share the kudos and which ones take all the credit for themselves.</p>

  <h4>Make a strong case for the impact of your project</h4> 
  <p>Put together a project page that explains what you are doing, why you're doing it, and how it benefits the organization. Include a prominent section that features "performance-review-ready" impact statements and links to data that back up those claims. People have their own careers to manage, meaning a clearly articulated value proposition that explains how people stand to benefit from working on your project would be a wise investment on your part. </p> 
  <p>Also consider whether the project might be personally meaningful to certain individuals. Perhaps they tirelessly evangelize for technical debt reduction, or maybe they're just looking for opportunities to demonstrate their leadership/technical skills. Does your project offer something they're not getting out of their usual core work? </p> 
  <p>Tailor the description of your project to the priorities and concerns of each potential contributor.</p> 
  <p>In one project the author managed, we were able to document the amount of OpEx (operational expenditures) and CapEx (capital expenditures) that would be reduced by achieving the project's goals. The figures were summarized and linked to live graphs of the system-performance improvements that were delivered. These artifacts became important parts of promotion packets and performance reviews for those who contributed to the project. Many engineers are uncomfortable highlighting their achievements, so leaving it to the data to tell the story was the perfect way to convey the significance of their accomplishments to their managers.</p> 
  <h4>Break down work into bite-sized pieces</h4> 
  <p>Organize tasks in a realistic manner, striking a balance between too many tiny tasks and those that are too large or complex. Ideally, individual steps should take from 30-60 minutes, 90 minutes at most. Don't underestimate the importance of describing each step in a way that makes it clear it's achievable within those timeframes. If people think it will take longer, they won't sign up. And if they don't understand exactly what's to be done, they will overestimate the time required, which leads to the next point. </p> 
  <p>Don't be afraid to break a complex task into multiple simple tasks. For example, "Sign off on XYZ design doc" could become:</p> 
  <ol type="1"> 
   <li>Create outline for XYZ design doc.</li> 
   <li>Create draft of XYZ design doc.</li> 
   <li>Identify teams that need to sign off on XYZ design doc.</li> 
   <li>Get teams to designate an individual to review the doc.</li> 
   <li>Send XYZ design doc to Person A for review.</li> 
   <li>Send XYZ design doc to Person B for review.</li> 
   <li>Incorporate review changes to XYZ design doc.</li> 
   <li>Get Person A and Person B to sign off on XYZ design doc.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>This probably seems obvious, but when people are trying to juggle those steps in their head and keep track of them, it adds to their level of stress. Providing this structure as part of your project task breakdown results in multiple benefits: the assignee has short-duration tasks that can readily be accomplished, you understand where in the process you are with respect to the overall goal, and you have tasks that could potentially be parallelized or delegated in order to improve execution speed.</p> 
  <p>With that said, it can still be overwhelming to see eight issues in a bug-tracking/work-tracking system. I learned this the hard way. Instead, steps like these should all be included in one master ticket as a checklist. Break them out into separate tickets on demand if a step is particularly large or has been assigned to a different owner.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h4>Structure your project for execution</h4> 
  <p>Use basic statements that indicate what's required, what the specific deliverable is, and what you expect to accomplish. This means structuring your tasks around crystal-clear deliverables. Those deliverables may be clear to you, but you don't know if they're clear to the assignee until you corroborate that with them. Review the tasks with the assignee to make sure that person knows <i>exactly</i> what is needed. Is it a document, a decision, or a configuration change that needs to be tested? Be sure the name or short description of the task includes that information, along with specific guidance as to what the constraints are. </p> 
  <p>If decisions need to be made, state them explicitly as part of an agenda for a meeting between the involved parties. For example, instead of "review XYZ changes," you should aim to "meet with the ABC team to understand any impact the proposed changes in XYZ design doc will have on the published release schedule for ABC." And don't forget the precursor task of "make XYZ design doc available to ABC team at least N weeks in advance." Make that meeting a task in its own right.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  <h3>Summary</h3> 
  <p>These techniques, consistently applied, are particularly effective when working with teams made up of people across a large company.</p> 
  <p>The author has applied these practices in many projects over the years with great success—most significantly, as part of a multiyear project called <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi20-li_shaohong.pdf">Thunderbolt</a> that required the involvement of a number of teams at multiple layers of Google's infrastructure stack. None of those teams would have directly benefited from making the changes, but the net effect of the project was to "save us millions of dollars on capital expenses by enabling otherwise nonexistent additional power capacity in our data centers." </p> 
  <p>It's easy to see how each of those teams could have decided they were too busy with their own priorities to make the required changes. However, by understanding the work environment (the fact that people are basically good but overworked and actually want to do a good job), by making the tasks attractive to people (well-defined, finite, and achievable), by taking into account human factors (impact statements that can be pasted into performance reviews), and by structuring for execution (properly sized steps, meeting clear needs, specific deliverables), dozens of people across many teams were able to work together to accomplish an amazing objective.</p> 
  <p>Which goes to show how we can achieve great things in the modern tech environment.</p>

	  <br />
	  By taking a holistic view of the commercial software-development process, we have identified tensions between various factors and where changes in one phase, or to infrastructure, affect other phases. We have distinguished four distinct forms of impact, warned against measuring against unknown counterfactuals, and suggested a consensus mechanism for estimating DDR (defect detection and resolution) costs. Our approach balances product outcomes and the strategic need for change with both the human and machine costs of producing valuable software.

	  <br />
	  This study has significant implications for practice, research, and education by providing new insights into IT project success. It expands the body of knowledge on project management by reporting project success (and not exclusively project management success), grounded in several objective criteria such as deliverables usage by the client in the post-project stage, hiring of project-related support/maintenance services by the client, contracting of new projects by the client, and vendor recommendation by the client to potential clients. Researchers can find a set of criteria they can use when studying and reporting the success of IT projects, thus expanding the current perspective on evaluation and contributing to more accurate conclusions.

	  <br />
	  Developer experience focuses on the lived experience of developers and the points of friction they encounter in their everyday work. In addition to improving productivity, DevEx drives business performance through increased efficiency, product quality, and employee retention. This paper provides a practical framework for understanding DevEx, and presents a measurement framework that combines feedback from developers with data about the engineering systems they interact with. These two frameworks provide leaders with clear, actionable insights into what to measure and where to focus in order to improve developer productivity.

	  <br />
	  Covid has changed how people work in many ways, but many of the outcomes have been paradoxical in nature. What works for one person may not work for the next (or even the same person the next day), and we have yet to figure out how to predict exactly what will work for everyone. As you saw in the composite personas described here, some people struggle with isolation and loneliness, have a hard time connecting socially with their teams, or find the time pressures of hybrid work with remote teams to be overwhelming. Others relish this newfound way of working, enjoying more time with family, greater flexibility to exercise during the day, a better work/life balance, and a stronger desire to contribute to the world.
