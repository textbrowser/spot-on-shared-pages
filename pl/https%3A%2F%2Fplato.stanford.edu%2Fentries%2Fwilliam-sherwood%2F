<h1>William of Sherwood</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 11, 2016; substantive revision Thu Sep 26, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
William of Sherwood (Guilelmus, Willelmus, Schyrwode, Shirwode,
Shyreswode, and others) was a 13th century English logician who taught
at the University of Paris and who worked in the Realist tradition of
logic. His <em>Introduction to Logic</em>, written in the middle of
the century, was one of the four most influential textbooks on logics
in the 13th century, along with Lambert of Auxerre&rsquo;s
<em>Summary</em>, Roger Bacon&rsquo;s <em>Art and Science of
Logic</em>, and Peter of Spain&rsquo;s <em>Summaries of Logic</em>.
Roger Bacon in his <em>Opus tertium</em> (1267) singles Sherwood out
for high praise, describing him as &ldquo;much wiser than Albert [the
Great]; for in <em>philosophia communis</em> no one is greater than
he&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1966, pp. 5&ndash;6; Kretzmann 1968, pp.
3&ndash;4).</p>

<h2 id="LifeWrit">1. Life and writing</h2>

<p>
William of Sherwood was born between 1200 and 1205, probably in
Nottinghamshire, and died between 1266 and 1272. His school career is
uncertain, but given references to his works and his influence on
people such as Peter of Spain, Lambert of Auxerre, Albert the Great,
and Thomas Aquinas, it is likely that he was teaching logic at the
University of Paris between 1235 and 1250. After that period, he seems
to have left logic. He was a master at Oxford in 1252 and treasurer of
the cathedral of Lincoln about two years later; still later, he was
rector at Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, and Attleborough, in Norfolk.
He was still alive in 1266 but dead by 1272 (Kretzmann 1968, p.
3).</p>

<p>
Part of the difficulty with establishing his biography is that he has
previously been conflated with various other 13th-century Englishmen
named William, such as William of Leicester (d. 1213) and William of
Durham (d. 1249) (cf. Grabmann 1937, pp. 11&ndash;13; Kretzmann 1966,
p. 3; Mullinger 1873, p. 177). He has also sometimes been identified
with others bearing the same surname, such as the author of
commentary, now lost, on the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard with
the title <em>Shirovodus super sententias</em>, a work that was known
to John Leland in the 16th century (Kretzmann 1966, p. 12), or
Ricardus de Schirewode, who wrote a treatise on insolubles surviving
in Cambridge, St John&rsquo;s MS 100. This confusion, along with the
usual problems presented by anonymous material, makes it difficult to
identify William&rsquo;s works with certainty.</p>

<p>
Two works can be confidently ascribed to Sherwood, an <em>Introduction
to Logic</em> and a treatise on syncategorematic terms, the
<em>Syncategoremata</em>. The <em>Introduction</em> survives in
complete form in only one manuscript, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale
MS. Lat. 16,617, from the late 13th or 14th century, which begins with
the heading <em>Introductiones Magistri Guilli. de Shyreswode in
logicam</em>, &ldquo;Introduction to Logic of Master William of
Sherwood&rdquo;. The <em>Syncategoremata</em> immediately follows, and
is likewise explicitly attributed to Sherwood. The
<em>Syncategoremata</em> also survives in a second manuscript,
Bodleian MS Digby 55, where it is again explicitly labeled,
<em>Sincategoreumata Magistri Willielmi de Sirewode</em>
&ldquo;[Treatise on] Syncategorematics of Master William of
Sherwood&rdquo;, and Chapter Five of the <em>Introduction</em>
survives in a second manuscript, MS Worcester Cath. Q. 13, written
around 1293/94, and edited by Pinborg &amp; Ebbesen (1984).</p>

<p>
The <em>Introduction</em> was almost certainly written while William
was lecturing on logic at the University of Paris; Ebbesen (2020, fn.
6) argues it probably dates from the 1230s. It was first edited by
Grabmann (1937) and translated into English by Kretzmann (1966). A new
critical edition was produced by Brands and Kann (1995), accompanied
by a translation into German. It has been argued (Mullinger 1873, p.
177) that this book was heavily influenced by a <em>Synopsis</em>
treatise written by the 11th-century Byzantine logician Michael
Constantine Psellus. The <em>Introduction</em> contains the first
appearance of the syllogistic mnemonic verse &lsquo;Barbara,
Celarent&hellip;&rsquo;, which Augustus de Morgan described as
&ldquo;magic words &hellip; more full of meaning than any that ever
were made&rdquo;, and Sherwood may even have been the inventor of the
verse, though references to individual names appear earlier (Kretzmann
1966, pp. 66&ndash;67).</p>

<p>
Sherwood&rsquo;s treatise on syncategorematic terms has long been held
to be if not the earliest such treatise, then the earliest still
accessible (Boehner 1952, p. 7). The text was first edited by
O&rsquo;Donnell (1941), and this edition along with the Paris MS was
the basis of Kretzmann&rsquo;s 1968 translation into English.
O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s edition has since been superseded by the
critical edition of Kann and Kirchhoff (2012), which also includes a
translation into German. Kirchhoff (2008) is an extensive discussion
and commentary on the <em>Syncategormeta</em>.</p>

<p>
Three other logical treatises follow the <em>Introductiones</em> and
the <em>Syncategoremata</em> in the Paris manuscript, which have as a
result been tentatively attributed to Sherwood. The first is a
treatise on insolubles, ff. 46&ndash;54, edited by Roure (1970), and
the second a treatise on <em>obligationes</em> found in Paris, Bibl.
Nat. 16617. This text was edited by Green (1963), who tentatively
attributed it to Sherwood. The third is the text <em>Petitiones
Contrariorum</em>, edited by de Rijk (1976), covering puzzles arising
from hidden contradictions in sets of premises. Sherwood may also be
the author of the <em>Fallaciae magistri Willelmi</em>
&ldquo;Fallacies, of Master William&rdquo; preserved in British
Museum, King&rsquo;s Library MS 9 E XII, as well as the treatise
ascribed to Richard of Sherwood noted above.</p>

<p>
Three further treatises have previously also been attributed to
Sherwood, but the evidence for their attribution is less clear: the
commentary on the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard noted above, a
<em>Distictiones theologicae</em>, and a <em>Concionces</em>, or
collection of sermons (Kretzmann 1968, p. 4).</p>

<h2 id="DoctCont">2. Doctrinal context</h2>

<p>
Along with Peter of Spain, Lambert of Auxerre, and Roger Bacon,
William of Sherwood was one of the first terminist logicians, working
in a context where the newly discovered and translated Aristotelian
material of the 12th century had become fully integrated into the
logical and philosophical curricula through the works of people such
as John le Page (Uckelman &amp; Lagerlund, 2016). The terminist period
of logic was marked by the development of logical genres and
techniques that go beyond Aristotle and mere commentaries on his
works. The two primary branches of terminist logic are the study of
the properties of terms and the study of the meaning and function of
syncategorematic words. Sherwood&rsquo;s <em>Introduction</em> picks
up the first of these two branches in its fifth chapter (the most
interesting chapter of the <em>Introduction</em>), and his
<em>Syncategoremata</em> deals with the second. The remainder of the
<em>Introductiones</em> is devoted to the standard Aristotelian
material: Chapter One on statements corresponds to <em>On
Interpretation</em>; Chapter Two on predicables to the
<em>Categories</em>; Chapter Three on syllogisms to the <em>Prior
Analytics</em>; Chapter Four on dialectical reasoning to the
<em>Topics</em>; and Chapter Six on sophistical reasoning to the
<em>Sophistical Refutations</em>. We will focus our attention in this
article on the unusual or distinctive aspects of his logical and
semantic theory, primarily found in Chapter Five of the
<em>Introduction</em> and in the <em>Syncategoremata</em>.</p>

<h2 id="SemaTheo">3. Semantic theory</h2>

<h3 id="PropTerm">3.1. Properties of terms</h3>

<p>
The theory of the properties of terms forms the basis of medieval
semantic theory and provides an account of how terms function within
the broader context of sentences, as well as how these different
functions can account for the different rules governing inference.
Sherwood identifies the four main properties of terms as (1)
signification; (2) supposition; (3) copulation; and (4) appellation
(Kretzmann 1966, p. 105). In this classification he differs from other
accounts which mention (1) signification; (2) supposition and
copulation; (3) ampliation and restriction; (4) appellation; and (5)
relation.</p>

<p>
Sherwood defines &lsquo;signification&rsquo; as &ldquo;a presentation
of the form of something to the understanding&rdquo;, a definition
harking back to 12th-century semantic theory (Kretzmann 1966, p. 105,
fn. 2). Supposition and copulation are symmetrically related to each
other; &lsquo;supposition&rsquo; is &ldquo;an ordering of the
understanding of something under something else&rdquo; while
&lsquo;copulation&rsquo; is &ldquo;an ordering of the understanding of
something over something else&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1966, p. 105). Only
substantive nouns, pronouns, and definite descriptions can have
supposition, while only adjectives, participles, and verbs can have
copulation (Kretzmann 1966, p. 106).</p>

<p>
Finally, &lsquo;appellation&rsquo; is &ldquo;the present correct
application of a term &mdash; i.e., the property with respect to which
what the term signifies can be said of something through the use of
the verb &lsquo;is&rsquo;&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1966, p. 106). That is,
the <em>appellata</em> of a term are the presently existing things of
which the term can currently be truly predicated. Appellation is
between supposition and copulation: Substantive nouns, adjectives, and
participles can have appellation, but pronouns and verbs cannot
(Kretzmann 1966, p. 106).</p>

<p>
The central notion of these three is supposition, and the majority of
the chapter is devoted to the division of supposition into its various
kinds:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Tree diagram: At the top is Supposition with 2 branches: Material and Formal; Formal has 2 branches: Simple and Personal; Simple has 3 leaves: Manerial, Reduplicative, and Unfixed; Personal has 2 branches: Determinate and Confused; Confused has 2 branches: Merely confused and Distributive confused; Distributive confused has 2 leaves: Mobile and Immobile." class="nocaption" src="sherwood-supposition.jpg" style="width:550px" />
</div>

<p>
For a discussion of most of the notions in this division as well as a
comparison of Sherwood&rsquo;s views to those of his 13th-century
contemporaries and his 14th-century posterity, see the entry on
 <a href="../medieval-terms/">medieval theories: properties of terms</a>.
 We briefly comment on two distinctive aspects of Sherwood&rsquo;s
supposition theory.</p>

<p>
The first is the inclusion of &lsquo;manerial&rsquo; supposition, a
type which does not appear outside of Sherwood. Some have considered
<em>manerialis</em> an error for <em>materialis</em>, and considered
Sherwood to have been talking here about material supposition
(Grabmann 1937). However, the manuscript shows <em>n</em> rather than
<em>t</em>, and the type of supposition is not the same as the
material supposition, which is distinguished from formal supposition,
but is itself a type of formal supposition. Sherwood says that
manerial supposition is a type of simple supposition in which &ldquo;a
word can be posited for its <em>significatum</em> without any
connection with things&rdquo;, and he gives as an example &ldquo;Man
is a species&rdquo;. The explanation is that this is manerial
supposition because &lsquo;man&rsquo; &ldquo;supposits for the
specific character in itself&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1966, p. 111). The
notion of <em>maneries</em> meaning &lsquo;character, way, mode,
manner&rsquo; can be found in 12th-century discussions of universals;
for example, John of Salisbury notes that Joscelin, Bishop of
Soissons, says that sometimes the words <em>genus</em> and
<em>species</em> &ldquo;are to be understood as things of a universal
kind&rdquo; and sometimes he &ldquo;interprets them as modes
(<em>maneries</em>) of things&rdquo; (Hall, Book II, ch. 17, p. 84).
John says he does not know where Joscelin got such a distinction, but
it occurs in Abelard and in the 12th-century <em>Fallacie
Parvipontane</em> (Hall, Book II, ch. 17, p. 84, fnn. a, b; de Rijk
1962, pp. 139, 562).</p>

<p>
The second is his treatment of singular (also called
&lsquo;discrete&rsquo;) terms, such as proper names or demonstrative
phrases like &lsquo;this cat&rsquo;. Such terms were often omitted
from explicit consideration in treatises on supposition, or were
mentioned but ultimately excluded (Brumberg-Chaumont 2013, p. 173).
Sherwood, on the other hand, recognizes that singular terms can have
both simple supposition as well as personal supposition
(Brumberg-Chaumont 2013, p. 174); this makes him &ldquo;the only
logician to take on all the implications of this position [that
discrete supposition is a type of personal supposition] and to
attribute to discrete terms a real capacity for semantic
variation&rdquo; (Brumberg-Chaumont 2013, pp. 184&ndash;185).</p>

<h3 id="SemaUnivAffi">3.2. Semantics of universal affirmatives</h3>

<p>
Statements are composed of two types of parts: principal and
secondary. The principal parts of a statement are the nouns and verbs,
that is, the subjects and predicates whose properties are the focus of
the first branch of terminist logic. The secondary parts are those
that remain: &ldquo;the adjectival name, the adverb, and conjunctions
and prepositions, for they are not necessary for the statement&rsquo;s
being&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1968, p. 13). These are words which do not
have signification in themselves, but only in conjunction with other
significative words, namely the subject and predicate (Kretzmann 1966,
p. 24). Because these words do not have signification in themselves,
they do not have any of the usual properties of terms &mdash;
supposition, copulation, and ampliation. Nevertheless, they still have
a significative function. Explaining this function is the focus of
Sherwood&rsquo;s treatise on syncategorematic terms.</p>

<p>
It is in this treatise that we can see evidence for what some have
said is a distinctively English approach to syncategorematic terms
(Uckelman &amp; Lagerlund 2016). Sherwood and his English contemporary
Roger Bacon both consider distributive terms such as
&lsquo;every&rsquo; to be syncategorematic, while in continental works
such as those by John le Page, Peter of Spain, and Nicholas of Paris,
distributive terms are usually considered in summary treatises in the
chapter on distribution (a chapter found in no English summary)
(Braakhuis 1981, pp. 138&ndash;139). In his consideration of
&lsquo;every&rsquo;, Sherwood argues that propositions involving
&lsquo;all&rsquo; require that there be at least three things for
which the predicate term truly stands:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Rule [II] The sign &lsquo;every&rsquo; or &lsquo;all&rsquo; requires
that there be at least three appellata (Kretzmann 1968, p. 23).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Remember that an <em>appellatum</em> is something which both exists
and which the subject stands for or refers to.) The justification for
this is taken from Aristotle, who Sherwood quotes as saying, &ldquo;Of
two men we say that they are two, or both, and not that they are
all&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1968, p. 23); that is, if there were fewer than
three, it would be more appropriate to say &lsquo;Both&rsquo; or
&lsquo;One&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;All&rsquo; (for further
discussion, see Mora-M&aacute;rquez 2015, p. 197).</p>

<p>
Sherwood is also noteworthy for being the first logician we know of to
treat &lsquo;is&rsquo; as a syncategorematic term (Kretzmann 1968, p.
90). He argues that &lsquo;is&rsquo; is equivocal, in that it can
indicate either (1) actual being (<em>esse actuale</em>) or (2)
habitual being (<em>esse habituale</em>) (Kretzmann 1968, p. 92,
Kretzmann 1966, p. 125; Kretzmann translates <em>habituale</em> as
&lsquo;relational&rsquo; in Kretzmann 1966 and as
&lsquo;conditional&rsquo; in Kretzmann 1968). As a result, the
sentence &lsquo;Every man is an animal&rsquo; is ambiguous. When
&lsquo;is&rsquo; is taken to indicate actual being, &lsquo;Every man
is an animal&rsquo; &ldquo;is false when no man exists&rdquo;
(Kretzmann 1968, p. 93). When &lsquo;is&rsquo; is taken to indicate
habitual being, then &ldquo;insofar as [&rdquo;Every man is an
animal&ldquo;] is necessary it has the force of this conditional:
&lsquo;if it is man it is an animal&rsquo;&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1966, p.
125). In analyzing universal affirmative categorical sentences in this
way, Sherwood can be seen as an &lsquo;early adopter&rsquo; of our
modern truth conditions for these sentences. A consequence of this
view is a commitment to the existence of <em>possibilia</em>, things
that could exist but which actually do not; such <em>possibilia</em>
have a diminished sort of being (<em>esse diminutum</em>) (Kretzmann
1968, p. 93). This was an unusual position in the thirteenth century
(Knuuttila 1993), and it was later denounced by William of Ockham
(Freddoso &amp; Schuurman 1980, p. 99).</p>

<h2 id="CateStatSyll">4. Categorical statements and syllogisms</h2>

<h3 id="SingPropHexaOppo">4.1. Singular propositions and the hexagon of opposition</h3>

<p>
Categorical statements are traditionally divided into universal
statements (&lsquo;All P are Q&rsquo;, &lsquo;No P are Q&rsquo;) and
partial statements (&lsquo;Some P is Q&rsquo;, &lsquo;Some P is not
Q&rsquo;), and it was routine, since Aristotle, for logicians to
investigate these types of statements through the
 <a href="../square/">traditional Square of Opposition</a>.
 Sherwood, however, explicitly distinguished a third type of
categorical statement, the singular, where the subject term is a
singular term. He argues that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Singular statements] differ [from partial statements] in this
respect: if two statements are singular and of different quality, they
are not subcontraries but, in accordance with the theory,
contradictories &mdash; e.g., &lsquo;Socrates is running,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Socrates is not running&rsquo; (Kretzmann 1968, p. 31).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sherwood was one of the first medieval logicians to explicitly
integrate singular statements into the Square of Opposition. The
result is a Hexagon of Opposition which shows how singular statements
entail and can be inferred from partial and universal statements with
the same subject and predicate terms. While no depiction of this
hexagon occurs in any extant manuscript of Sherwood&rsquo;s
<em>Introduction</em>, Khomskii has argued that it is likely that at
one point, the diagram was included in the text (Khomskii 2010).</p>

<h3 id="SyllMnem">4.2. Syllogism mnemonic</h3>

<p>
Syllogisms are characterised by their figure &mdash; the relative
arrangement of the terms &mdash; and their mood &mdash; the triple of
copulae that connect the terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Figure 1</th>
<th>Figure 2</th>
<th>Figure 3</th> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>P__M</td>
  <td>M__P</td>
  <td>P__M</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>M__S</td>
  <td>M__S</td>
  <td>S__M</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>P__S</td>
  <td>P__S</td>
  <td>P__S</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
where P is the predicate of the conclusion (the major term), S is the
subject of the conclusion (the minor term), and M is the middle
term.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Introduction,</em> Sherwood provides his students with a
mnemonic verse to remember which figure is which:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The difference of the figures is retained in this verse:</p>

<p>
<em>Sub pre prima bis pre secunda tertia bis sub</em> (Kretzmann 1968,
p. 66).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, in the first figure, the middle term is first the subject and
then the predicate; in the second, it is the predicate twice; in the
third, it is the subject twice. This same verse occurs in Roger Bacon
(Bacon 2009, &para;290), and Lambert of Auxerre has the same content
though in a much more verbose form (Lambert 2015, p. 139). Following
this, Sherwood then says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The moods and their reductions, on the other hand, are retained in
these verses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Barbara celarent darii ferio baralipton
<br />
Celantes dabitis fapesmo frisesomorum
<br />
Cesare camestres festino baroco
<br />
Darapti felapton disamis datisi bocardo ferison</em> (Kretzmann 1968,
p. 66)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kretzmann notes that this is &ldquo;the oldest known surviving version
of these famous mnemonic verses, and Sherwood may have been the
inventor of them &hellip; However, there were earlier attempts at the
same sort of device in the thirteenth century, and the word
&lsquo;Festino&rsquo; appears &lsquo;in a MS dating at the latest from
1200&prime;&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1968, pp. 66&ndash;67, quoting
Bochenski), and similar verses also occur in the 12th-century
<em>Logica Ut Dicit</em> and the <em>Logic &lsquo;cum sit
nostra&rsquo;</em> (Bacon 2009, p. 146), both of which texts
influenced Sherwood (Brumberg-Chaumont 2013, p. 184). Later, in the
same footnote, Kretzmann compares Sherwood&rsquo;s verses to those in
Peter of Spain and concludes that the differences between the two
&ldquo;strongly suggest at least one earlier version on which both men
were drawing&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1968, p. 67). The verse is in dactylic
hexameter, a classical style found in Homer (in Greek) and Ovid and
Virgil (in Latin), suggesting &ldquo;that the anonymous creator of the
mnemonic was schooled in poetry over and above, as we will see, being
masterful in his knowledge of Aristotle and imaginative in
logic&rdquo; (Corcoran, et al., 2018, p. 13).</p>

<p>
Sherwood explains the mnemonic names as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In these lines &lsquo;a&rsquo; signifies a universal affirmative
proposition, &lsquo;e&rsquo; a universal negative, &lsquo;i&rsquo; a
particular affirmative, &lsquo;o&rsquo; a particular negative,
&lsquo;s&rsquo; simple conversion [<em>conversio simplex</em>],
&lsquo;p&rsquo; conversion by limitation [<em>conversio per
accidens</em>], &lsquo;m&rsquo; transposition of the premisses, and
&lsquo;b&rsquo; and &lsquo;r&rsquo; when they are in the same word
signify reduction <em>per impossibile</em>. The first two lines are
devoted to the first figure, the four words of the third line to the
second figure, and all the other words to the third figure (Kretzmann
1968, p. 67).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that, conveniently, &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;i&rsquo; are the
first two vowels in Latin <em>affirmo</em> &lsquo;I affirm&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;e&rsquo; and &lsquo;o&rsquo; are the two vowels in Latin
<em>nego</em> &lsquo;I deny&rsquo;. While the names that Sherwood
introduces are typical/traditional, the explanation he gives of the
names is <em>not</em>. First, he doesn&rsquo;t note that the first
letter of the name indicates to which of the four basic syllogisms,
Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Ferio, the others can be reduced.
Second, his identification of &lsquo;b&rsquo; and &lsquo;r&rsquo; as
the cues for <em>reductio per impossibile</em> are atypical.</p>

<h2 id="Moda">5. Modality</h2>

<p>
In his <em>Introduction</em>, Sherwood gives two definitions for
&lsquo;mode&rsquo;, depending on whether the term is being used
broadly or strictly: &ldquo;Broadly speaking, a mode is the
determination of an act, and in this respect it goes together with
every adverb&rdquo;, while strictly speaking we count not all adverbs
as modes but only those which determine the inherence of the predicate
in the subject (Kretzmann 1966, p. 40). Thus, on the broad conception
of &lsquo;mode&rsquo;, both &lsquo;Socrates is necessarily
running&rsquo; and &lsquo;Socrates is swiftly running&rsquo; count as
modal statements, but on the narrow conception, only the former does.
The six modes are &lsquo;true&rsquo;, &lsquo;false&rsquo;,
&lsquo;possible&rsquo;, &lsquo;contingent&rsquo;,
&lsquo;impossible&rsquo;, and &lsquo;necessary&rsquo;, though
&ldquo;the first two do not distinguish a modal proposition from an
assertoric statement&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1966, pp. 40&ndash;41). The
other four modes give rise to properly modal propositions, and in
statements expressing these propositions, the associated modal adverbs
are &lsquo;possibly&rsquo;, &lsquo;contingently&rsquo;,
&lsquo;impossibly&rsquo;, and &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo;. Each of these
modal adverbs is a syncategorematic term; and in the
<em>Syncategoremata</em>, Sherwood devotes an entire chapter to
<em>necessario</em> (&lsquo;necessarily&rsquo;) and
<em>contingenter</em> (&lsquo;contingently&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
Here it must be noted that Sherwood&rsquo;s views of modality differ
significantly from modern views. Modern modal logic interprets modes
in a nominal way, e.g., &lsquo;necessary:&rsquo;,
&lsquo;impossible:&rsquo;, etc. But Sherwood is reluctant to admit a
statement such as &ldquo;That Socrates is running is necessary&rdquo;
as genuinely modal (Kretzmann 1966, p. 43), instead viewing this as an
assertoric categorical statement predicating &lsquo;necessary&rsquo;
of &lsquo;that Socrates is running&rsquo;. Similarly, &lsquo;Socrates
is running necessarily&rsquo; does not count as a modal statement,
because here &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; modifies &lsquo;running&rsquo;,
not &ldquo;the inherence of the predicate in the subject&rdquo;. The
only genuinely modal construction is that exhibited by &lsquo;Socrates
is necessarily running&rsquo; (Kretzmann 1966, p. 42). The importance
of the adverbial construction, where the modal adverb modifies the
inherence of the predicate with the subject, is emphasized in the
discussions of modal adverbs in <em>Syncategoremata</em>, which
include not only the chapter mentioned above but also analyses of how
modal adverbs interact with other syncategorematic terms such as
&lsquo;only&rsquo;, &lsquo;unless&rsquo;, and &lsquo;if&rsquo;
(Uckelman 2020, &sect;5).</p>

<p>
Since Aristotle it was standard practice to note that
&lsquo;possible&rsquo; can be used in two ways. In the first
&lsquo;possible&rsquo; is compatible with &lsquo;necessary&rsquo;, but
in the second, that which is necessary is not (merely) possible. This
second way is usually called &lsquo;contingent&rsquo;. Sherwood
mentions this distinction, but goes on to say that he will be using it
in a broader sense, in which possibility is compatible with necessity
(Kretzmann 1966, p. 41). However, he makes a further distinction,
which he does maintain, between the two ways that
&lsquo;impossible&rsquo; and &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; can be used.
These different ways are expressed in temporal notions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[impossible] is used in one way of whatever cannot be true now or in
the future or in the past; and this is &lsquo;impossible <em>per
se</em>&rsquo; &hellip; It is used in the other way of whatever cannot
be true now or in the future although it could have been true in the
past &hellip; and this is &lsquo;impossible <em>per
accidens</em>&rsquo;. Similarly, in case something cannot be false now
or in the future or in the past it is said to be &lsquo;necessary
<em>per se</em>&rsquo; &hellip; But it is &lsquo;necessary <em>per
accidens</em>&rsquo; in case something cannot be false now or in the
future although it could have been [false] in the past (Kretzmann
1966, p. 41).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sherwood says that the reason it is important to separate modal
propositions from assertoric ones is that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[s]ince our treatment is oriented toward syllogism, we have to
consider them under those differences that make a difference in
syllogism. These are such differences as &hellip; modal, assertoric;
and others of that sort. For one syllogism differs from another as a
result of those differences (Kretzmann 1966, p. 39).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite this, there is &ldquo;no treatment of modal syllogisms in any
of the works that have been ascribed to Sherwood&rdquo; (Kretzmann
1966, p. 39, fn. 58). For more on Sherwood&rsquo;s account of
modality, see Uckelman 2008.</p>

<h2 id="Infl">6. Influence</h2>

<p>
Roger Bacon&rsquo;s approbation of Sherwood is not the only explicit
reference we have to him by his contemporaries. The copy of Chapter
Five of the <em>Introduction</em> found in MS Worcester Cath. Q. 13
mentioned earlier is followed by a collection of anonymous notes (also
edited in Pinborg &amp; Ebbesen 1984 and there called the
<em>Dubitationes</em>). Pinborg and Ebbesen argue that these lecture
notes, composed either for a teacher&rsquo;s or a student&rsquo;s use,
are unlikely to have been written in response to lectures given in the
1290s, i.e., when the manuscript was copied, but rather date from the
1260s or the 1270s, favoring a date around 1270 (Pinborg and Ebbesen
1984, p. 104). This text thus provides evidence that Sherwood&rsquo;s
works continued to be taught and circulated.</p>

<p>
Beyond these explicit mentions, it is clear that Sherwood&rsquo;s
works were widely influential among logicians at the University of
Paris in the second half of the 13th century. The most direct line of
influence runs from William of Sherwood to his much better-known
colleague Peter of Spain. It was for many years believed that Peter
was the first person to translate Psellus&rsquo;s text (Mullinger
1873, p. 176), prior to the rediscovery of Sherwood&rsquo;s
<em>Introduction</em>, which pre-dates Peter by two decades and which
is closer to Psellus&rsquo;s work. Peter&rsquo;s <em>Summary of
Logic</em> is clearly indebted to Sherwood. Kretzmann notes that
&ldquo;many of the features of the <em>Summulae</em> that made it far
and away the most popular logic textbook in the Middle Ages seem quite
plainly to have developed as modifications of more difficult
discussions and less felicitous mnemonic devices in the
<em>Introductiones</em>&rdquo; (Kretzmann 1968, p. 6). On the other
hand, Sherwood appears to have been influenced by Peter&rsquo;s
treatise on syncategorematic terms in writing his own; Kretzmann
provides a summary of passages in Sherwood&rsquo;s treatise which
&ldquo;can be read as allusions to positions taken by Peter&rdquo;
(1968, p. 7). Other influences can be found in Albert the Great, who
used Sherwood&rsquo;s notion of appellation rather than Peter of
Spain&rsquo;s (Kretzmann 1966, p. 5), and Thomas Aquinas, whose
analysis of modal propositions follows Sherwood (Kretzmann 1966, p. 5;
Uckelman 2008).</p>

<p>
Though Sherwood&rsquo;s indirect influence on the development of logic
and semantics, via his influence on Peter of Spain, should not be
underestimated, his direct influence beyond the 13th century was more
minimal, in part because the influence of Peter of Spain was so great.
In the 14th century, any influence Sherwood&rsquo;s approach to the
properties of terms might have still had was almost entirely eclipsed
by figures such as William of Ockham, John Buridan, and Albert of
Saxony (Bos 2011, p. 773).</p>
