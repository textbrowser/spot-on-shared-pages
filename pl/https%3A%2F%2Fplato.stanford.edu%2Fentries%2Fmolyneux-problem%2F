<h1>Molyneux&rsquo;s Problem</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Jun 30, 2005; substantive revision Thu Jan 8, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem asks whether a person born blind, capable of
distinguishing a sphere and a cube by touch, could, if their vision
were restored, recognize these shapes by sight alone.</p>

<p>
This problem, posed by the Irish scientist and politician William
Molyneux (1656&ndash;1698) to John Locke, who published it in his
<em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1694), has ngaged
philosophers and scientists from the Enlightenment to the present day.
Its study has deepened our understanding of how ideas are acquired,
how they transfer between different senses, and how such processes
ultimately contribute to the formation of knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="MolForPro">1. Molyneux&rsquo;s Formulation of the Problem</h2>

<p>
Molyneux&rsquo;s <em>Dioptrica Nova</em> (1692), a work on optics and
psychology of sight, reflected the general fascination with optics of
his time. Molyneux&rsquo;s interest was also personal as his wife lost
her sight in the first year of their marriage (Simms 1982). The direct
influence for formulating what would become &ldquo;Molyneux&rsquo;s
problem&rdquo; was a French &ldquo;extract&rdquo; of Locke&rsquo;s
<em>An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding</em>, published in 1688
in the <em>Biblioth&egrave;que Universelle &amp; Historique</em>. In
this extract, Locke distinguishes between ideas we acquire by one
sense, such as colour and texture, and those we acquire by a
combination of senses, such as space, figure, movement, and rest.
Locke further claims that a person deprived of a particular sense will
lack the ideas belonging to it: a blind person, for example, can have
no idea of colour. Molyneux extended this reasoning by asking whether
a person born blind would be deprived of a visual idea of shape if
they already know shape by touch alone. A devoted admirer of Locke,
Molyneux dedicated <em>Dioptrica Nova</em> to him before his
problem&rsquo;s inclusion in Locke&rsquo;s <em>Essay</em>, securing
its legacy in the empiricist tradition.</p>

<p>
On Saturday 7 July 1688 William Molyneux sent a letter to Locke
setting out for the first time his problem concerning the person born
blind:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Dublin July. 7. 88</p>

<p>
A Problem Proposed to the Author of the <em>Essai Philosophique
concernant L&rsquo;Entendement</em></p>

<p>
A Man, being born blind, and having a Globe and a Cube, nigh of the
same bignes, Committed into his Hands, and being taught or Told, which
is Called the Globe, and which the Cube, so as easily to distinguish
them by his Touch or Feeling; Then both being taken from Him, and Laid
on a Table, Let us Suppose his Sight Restored to Him; Whether he
Could, by his Sight, and before he touch them, know which is the Globe
and which the Cube? Or Whether he Could know by his Sight, before he
stretch&rsquo;d out his Hand, whether he Could not Reach them, tho
they were Removed 20 or 1000 feet from Him?</p>

<p>
If the Learned and Ingenious Author of the Forementiond Treatise think
this Problem Worth his Consideration and Answer, He may at any time
Direct it to One that Much Esteems him, and is,</p>

<p>
His Humble Servant</p>

<p>
William Molyneux</p>

<p>
High Ormonds Gate in Dublin. Ireland</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For reasons unknown Locke never replied to this letter. After a few
years of amicable correspondence Molyneux presented Locke with a
simplified version of his problem in a letter, dated 2 March 1693,
asking Locke to perhaps find some place in his Essay to say something
about it. This time Locke reacted with enthusiasm: &ldquo;Your
ingenious problem will deserve to be published to the world.&rdquo;
Locke quoted the letter almost verbatim in the second edition of his
<em>Essay</em> (1694), in Book 2, Chapter 9, Section 8:
&ldquo;Sensations often changed by the judgment.&rdquo; as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose a Man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to
distinguish between a Cube, and a Sphere of the same metal, and nighly
of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and
t&rsquo;other; which is the Cube, which the Sphere. Suppose then the
Cube and Sphere placed on a Table, and the Blind Man to be made to
see. Quaere, Whether by his sight, before he touch&rsquo;d them, he
could now distinguish, and tell, which is the Globe, which the
Cube.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke also quoted Molyneux&rsquo;s own &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Not. For though he has obtain&rsquo;d the experience of, how a
Globe, how a Cube affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the
Experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his
sight so or so; Or that a protuberant angle in the Cube, that pressed
his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye, as it does in the
Cube.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke also added his admiration and agreement with Molyneux, as well
as an amendment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I agree with this thinking Gent. whom I am proud to call my Friend, in
his answer to this his problem; and am of opinion, that the Blind Man,
at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say, which was the
Globe, which the Cube, whilst he only saw them: though he could
unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by
the difference of their Figures felt. This I have set down, and leave
with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be
beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he
thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. (<em>Essay</em>
II. ix. 8: 146)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem was the fundamental question of the 18th
Century for epistemology and psychology (Cassirer 1955) and captured
the attention of many philosophers and men of learning throughout
history, including Berkeley, Leibniz, Voltaire, Diderot, La Mettrie,
Helmholtz, and William James.</p>

<h2 id="FirPhiDisExpDat">2. First Philosophical Discussions and Experimental Data</h2>

<p>
Philosophers initially regarded Molyneux&rsquo;s problem as a kind of
thought experiment to be dealt with by reflection and conceptual
analysis. Berkeley (1709) offered a more radical &ldquo;no&rdquo;
answer than his fellow empiricists, Molyneux and Locke, arguing that
the ideas of sight and touch bore no similarity at all. By contrast,
those of a more rationalist persuasion, such as Synge (1693), Lee
(1702), Leibniz (1704), and Hutcheson (1727) answered
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; maintaining that similarities between sight and
touch could either be reasoned out or were innately linked.
Leibniz&rsquo;s own yes answer resisted Locke&rsquo;s &ldquo;at first
sight&rdquo; amendment, contending that time should be allowed for
full recovery of sight, a point that would later prove crucial in
later experimental tests of Molyneux&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>
The English surgeon William Cheselden (1688&ndash;1752) was the first
to publish an experimental account of &ldquo;new sight&rdquo; by a congenitally
blind person after surgical displacement of cataracts (1728). The
publication led philosophers like Berkeley to regard Molyneux&rsquo;s
problem as experimentally resolvable. In his somewhat anecdotal
report, Cheselden observed his patient&rsquo;s response &ldquo;at
first sight.&rdquo; &ldquo;When he first saw, he was so far from
making any judgment of distances, that he thought all objects whatever
touched his eyes (as he expressed it) as what he felt did his
skin.&rdquo; (Cheselden 1728, 448) For Berkeley (1733), this provided
not only evidence for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer but also confirmation
of his own conjecture that first sight would lack spatial extension,
with objects seemingly &ldquo;to be in his eye&rdquo; (Berkeley 1709,
Section 41).</p>

<p>
By contrast, Voltaire (1738), Buffon (1749), Diderot (1749), La
Mettrie (1750), Condillac (1754), and Reid (1764) thought that
Cheselden&rsquo;s observations were ambiguous. They argued that the
newly sighted would require time to recover from surgery, or need
tactile experience or geometrical knowledge to identify the shapes
correctly. Rather than settling philosophical debate over
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem, Cheselden&rsquo;s experiment intensified it,
provoking renewed intrigue, speculation, and a proliferation of both
conceptual analysis and experimental analogues.</p>

<h2 id="EmpAppNinCen">3. Empirical Approaches in the Nineteenth Century</h2>

<p>
A second wave of somewhat novel, yet anecdotal, experimental data
defines the era of study of Molyneux&rsquo;s problem at the turn of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>
New accounts of different kinds of blind subjects, most of whom could
distinguish light from dark but not shapes, in a variety of different
experimental conditions, suggested that, after time, some newly
sighted subjects could partially distinguish and identify visual
properties by sight alone. (Abbott 1864) Sir Everard Home (1807)
tested a young boy age 10, about the distances of candlelight and the
sun, giving a report similar to Cheselden&rsquo;s boy saying,
&ldquo;it appeared to touch his eyes.&rdquo; (Abbott 1904, 546) Dr.
Franz (1841) performed experiments on a teenage boy newly healed from
strabismus, able to see light and some colour, but no shapes or
distances. Using the prescribed globe and cube, and after several
days, Franz reported that his patient called out related
two-dimensional versions of the shapes, a disc and &ldquo;quadrangular
figure.&rdquo; Dr. Ramsay (1903) performed experiments on a
30-year-old man after cataract surgery. Ramsay reported that upon
sight, the man identified a face: &ldquo;he knew from having felt his
own face&hellip;that he must be looking at a face.&rdquo; (Abbott
1904, 549) A day later, the man distinguished a ball from a brick,
moving his fingers, &ldquo;trying to feel them in imagination.&rdquo;
(Abbott 1904, 550) While some of these reports agreed with
Cheselden&rsquo;s observations, others stood in marked contrast.
Meaningful comparison between these cases is difficult due to
significant differences in pre- and post-operative conditions. As
might be expected, this diversity of experimental data expanded the
range of possible solutions to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem and paradigms
for its testing.</p>

<p>
Some novel paradigms considered observations of the sight of newly
born animals and babies when discussing Molyneux&rsquo;s problem. Adam
Smith (1795), known best as an Economist, was the first to report his
observations of the behaviors of newly-hatched chicks, newborn foals
and calves, and newborn human infants. This suggested to Smith that
Berkeley&rsquo;s &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem
was incorrect: there is an immediate ability to visually identify
objects previously known only to touch. Smith further speculated on
innate connections between the senses in both newborn animals and
human babies, a point subsequently mentioned by Thomas Brown (1838),
Charles Bailey (1842), and T.K. Abbott (1904). Johannes
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s (1826) experiments in bird vision further
supported these animal observations and their speculations of innate
connections between sight and touch. John Stewart Mill (1842) agreed
with these views about animal vision, but argued they could not
reasonably be applied to human vision.</p>

<p>
The invention of the stereoscope by Charles Wheatstone (1838), a
device which instigated binocular vision of depth from flat
photographs taken from slightly different angles, suggested immediate
3D spatial experience by sight alone. Samuel Bailey (1842), for
instance, concluded from this and the report from Home&rsquo;s (1807)
once-blind patient a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem:
the newly sighted upon seeing a shape through two retinal images,
&ldquo;the perception of an object of three dimensions would be
doubtless produced in his mind.&rdquo; (Bailey 1842, 100&ndash;1)
While Bailey believed depth was an innate ability of the mind, Mill
(1842) argued that it was learned, albeit quickly.</p>

<p>
Anecdotal observations from cataract surgeries and behaviors of young
animals and infants were used as evidence in the debate concerning the
question of whether the perception of space is innate or acquired.
Although Molyneux&rsquo;s problem was frequently invoked in this
debate, consensus on its proper solution remained elusive.</p>

<h2 id="ModApp">4. Modern Approaches</h2>

<p>
Throughout much of the twentieth century, interest in Molyneux&rsquo;s
problem was primarily historical. Molyneux&rsquo;s problem is commonly
presented as such in textbooks and general histories of psychology and
other cognitive sciences. Historians of philosophy analyze answers to
Molyneux for a better understanding of a philosopher&rsquo;s thought.
For instance, many scholars argue that Locke&rsquo;s wider views, like
shape being a common sensible, align better with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
answer: J.L. Mackie (1976) argues that Locke must mean only 2D shape
is a common sensible. Other scholars question whether even 2D shape is
a common sensible for Locke (Levin 2020) or they defend 3D shape as a
common sensible for Locke, mitigating his &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer via
judgment (Bruno and Mandelbaum 2010; Berchielli 2003), simple and
complex ideas (Ayers 1993), primary qualities (Vaughan 2018) or
several of these simultaneously (Glenney 2024; Ott 2020). Other
philosophical historians have written book-length focused histories of
the problem (Glenney 2024; Riskin 2002; Morgan 1977), with others
providing more comprehensive analyses (Degenaar 1996).</p>

<p>
Developments in cataract surgeries since Cheselden show that only a
few cases fit Molyneux&rsquo;s profile (Valvo 1971), as the vast
majority of cases are detected in infancy and treated as early as
possible. One of the most discussed experiments is by Held et al.
(2011), who tested five congenitally blind subjects whose vision had
been restored through cataract surgery. Controls were added to show
that the subjects could identify shapes by touch and sight
independently, passing vision-to-vision and touch-to-touch shape
matching tests. All subjects failed the touch-to-vision test, barely
better than if the subjects had guessed, supporting a &ldquo;no&rdquo;
answer to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem. However, three were successful
when tested after a few days of &ldquo;natural real-world experience
(Held et al. 552),&rdquo; suggesting that such cross-modal mappings
are rapidly made available, perhaps through brain plasticity or
unmasking of innate pathways.</p>

<p>
Held et al.&rsquo;s experiment suggests a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem if Locke&rsquo;s &ldquo;at first sight&rdquo;
amendment is included, though it is common to criticize the robustness
of the visual experiences of these newly sighted subjects (Spence et
al. 2024; Van Cleve 2014; Schwenkler 2013). It remains an open
question whether Molyneux&rsquo;s original question would have also
been answered &ldquo;no&rdquo;, which allows time and adequate visual
experience but without tactile experience. The timing of the visual
test remains ambiguous: should we test the subject right after surgery
or allow time for restoration of visual capacities (Levin 2008)? The
conditions of both versions generate a paradox: robust visual shape
recognition normally requires a physically healthy visual system
trained by active bodily experience, including active touch, opening
the door to contamination with touch on the path to cross-modal
learning. In this respect, not only are once-blind post-operative
newly sighted human subjects poor candidates for robust vision, but
the active tactile experiences normally associated with vision risk
the purity of Molyneux&rsquo;s test through the acquisition of visual
knowledge of shapes by way of perceptual learning from touch (for a
review, see <!-- Ferretti and Glenney forthcoming; --> Ferretti and
Glenney 2020; Ferretti 2018; Glenney 2013; Gallagher 2005; Jacomuzzi
et al. 2003). As such, no control would provide certainty that
subjects will be experientially and inferentially na&iuml;ve to
aspects of shape identification by sight alone. However, recent
adaptations offer a potential resolution to this paradox.</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the century, several new technologies and
experimental paradigms more amenable to experimental control began to
provide renewed interest in resolving Molyneux&rsquo;s problem.
Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) that present information normally
handled by one modality, such as vision, to another sense, typically
audition or touch, were developed in the context of mobility or
reading (Morgan, 1977). SSD experiments show that subjects need some
time to learn to distinguish and identify objects, with some
interpreting this delay as suggestive of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer
(Morgan 1977). Others argue that SSDs unmask innate connections
between the senses as evidenced by how quickly their use is learned,
suggesting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; answer to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem
(Hillenbrand et al. 2018). Others argue that SSDs are not a
substitution but an augmentation of a sense and that to learn to use
such devices is only an approximation to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem
(Auvray et al. 2009).</p>

Another variation of Molyneux&rsquo;s problem was suggested by Evans
(1985). He wondered whether the visual cortex of a patient with
congenital blindness could be electrically stimulated in such a way
that the patient experiences a pattern of light flashes (phosphenes)
in the shape of a square or circle. This question has been
investigated experimentally, but the results do not provide a final
answer to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem (Jacomuzzi et al. 2003) However,
improved non-invasive visual prostheses as well as more invasive
technologies, such as electrostimulation of visual pathways, gene
therapy, stem cells, or optogenetics may one day provide full visual
restoration to people born blind (Ptito et al. 2021). However, even
such conditions may fail to provide a satisfactory answer to
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem based on recent progress in reconceptualizing
blindness and visual studies.</p>

<p>
Blindness today is often understood as less about a loss of sight and
more as abnormal development of the visual system (Fine &amp; Park
2018). Others have reconceptualized sight as more of a learned skill:
training and experience with other senses, especially touch, are
needed to know where to look at an object for its identification, to
appreciate that smaller appearing objects may represent distant
objects, and to infer hidden sides of an object made invisible under
some perspectives (Toribio 2020). Others present Molyneux&rsquo;s
problem from the context of vision&rsquo;s ocular, physiological, and
cortical processing levels, including their normal cognitive
development, where if the ocular processing is restored, cortical
processing may still fail (Ferretti and Glenney 2020; Ferretti 2018;
Glenney 2013; Gallagher 2005).</p>

<p>
Visual processing is also understood in the context of the Two Visual
Systems Model: vision-for-recognition and vision-for-action (Goodale
et al. 1995). Molyneux&rsquo;s problem may also include a new question
on action: would a newly sighted subject be able to automatically
grasp an object by sight alone (Gallagher 2005)? Ferretti (2018)
argues that due to visual impairments at the cortical level of visual
processing, Molyneux subjects would display problems in both
recognition and visual guidance of action that make them unprepared
for a grasping test. Molyneux&rsquo;s problem thus involves multiple
meanings of vision, blindness, and visual restoration (Brogaard et al.
2020). Under Molyneux&rsquo;s original description, a Molyneux
experiment may turn out to require a scientific miracle.
Alternatively, subjects who are visually na&iuml;ve yet primed for
vision, such as human infants and non-human animals, may yield more
reliable results.</p>

<p>
Just-born infants are both visually na&iuml;ve and primed for vision,
making them excellent candidates for a Molyneux experiment. This may
account for why they produce results opposite to Held&rsquo;s (2011)
surgically recovering once-blind subjects. Several hours-old infants
look to familiar shapes known previously by their feel in their mouths
(Meltzoff et al.1979) or look to novel shapes previously unknown but
by their feel in their right hands (Streri 2012), looking being a
behavioral basis for identifying visually novel shapes by sight alone.
A variety of non-human animals are similarly successful at visually
identifying shapes previously known only by another sense, including
ants, birds, crabs, dolphins, fish, frogs, and a variety of mammals
(Glenney 2024). Bees and bats fly to cube shapes known previously by
touch or echolocation, respectively, though all these animal subjects
have had natural, real-world experiences. By contrast, Versace et al.
(2024) showed that newborn chicks dark-reared with either pointy- or
smooth-featured shapes identified them immediately in lit conditions
by sight alone. These chick behaviors, much like the human
newborns&rsquo; looking behaviors, suggest a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; answer
to a modified &ldquo;action&rdquo; version of Molyneux&rsquo;s problem
that is freed from verbal-based identification and one-off
experimental conditions of past Molyneux experiments on humans.</p>

<p>
Many recent developments to Molyneux&rsquo;s problem have focused on
the different aspects of this problem (Ferretti and Glenney 2024), and
evaluated its use as a tool for understanding a variety of related
concerns, from vision and cross-modal processing to new historical
analyses of philosophers to the concept of disability (Ferretti and
Glenney 2020). New philosophical theories gain insight from using
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem as a &ldquo;test case&rdquo;, provoking not
just novel problems, but revisions that help these theories progress.
<!-- (Ferretti and Glenney, forthcoming) --> In addition, new
methodologies come to light that treat Molyneux&rsquo;s problem as a
generative muse (Matthen and Cohen, 2020) and a guide for enhancing
pluralist methodologies (Glenney 2024).</p>

<h2 id="Con">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The history surrounding Molyneux&rsquo;s problem belies a complexity
that Molyneux himself could not have anticipated. In fact, there is no
problem in the history of the philosophy of perception that has
provoked more reflection, refinement, and experimentation than the
problem that Molyneux posed over three centuries ago. In this respect,
Molyneux&rsquo;s problem stands as one of the most fertile
thought-experiments in the history of philosophy, all the more
provocative and conceptually rich as related disciplines advance in
their understanding of the mind, brain, and the senses.</p>
