<h1>Animal Consciousness</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Dec 23, 1995; substantive revision Tue Jan 13, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Is there something it&rsquo;s like to be an octopus, a bee, a snail?
For much of the twentieth century, research into animal cognition
tended to avoid questions of consciousness, following the lead of
human neuroscience, where such questions were also marginalized (see
the entries on
 <a href="../cognition-animal/">animal cognition</a>,
 <a href="../comparative-cognition/">methods in comparative cognition</a>).
 However, the growing profile of consciousness science since 2000 has
brought the topic of consciousness back into the scientific mainstream
(see the entry on
 <a href="../consciousness-neuroscience/">the neuroscience of consciousness</a>),
 and this has led to resurgent interest in studying conscious
experience in other animals.</p>

<p>
There is now an emerging interdisciplinary field of &ldquo;animal
consciousness research&rdquo; or &ldquo;animal sentience
research&rdquo; bringing together researchers from neuroscience,
comparative psychology, animal welfare and veterinary science,
evolutionary biology, and philosophy. This mix of disciplines has
generated lively and heated discussions, many occurring in the pages
of the journal <em>Animal Sentience</em>, founded in 2016. Because of
the inherent difficulties of studying conscious experience, the area
is characterized by conceptual and methodological disagreement. Yet
questions of animal consciousness have tremendous significance for
animal ethics and animal welfare (see the entry on
 <a href="../moral-animal/">the moral status of animals</a>
 and
 <a href="../grounds-moral-status/">the grounds of moral status</a>),
 leading many to conclude that they are too important to leave wholly
unanswered, despite the high level of uncertainty. Consequently,
animal consciousness has become an area of unusually vigorous
collaboration between philosophers and scientists.</p>

<p>
Our focus here will be on philosophical issues, but we have also
included a supplement on
 <a href="evidence.html">evidence concerning animal consciousness</a>
 that aims to provide an entry point to the empirical literature.</p>

<h2 id="AniConPhi">1. Animal Consciousness and Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Why does animal consciousness matter? While the questions are
intrinsically fascinating, they also connect to a wide range of other
issues in the philosophy of science and medicine, the philosophy of
mind, psychology and psychiatry, the philosophy of religion, and
ethics.</p>

<p>
<em>Human exceptionalism:</em> Philosophy often begins with questions
about the place of humans in nature. One way humans have attempted to
locate themselves is through comparison with other animals. In
Biblical cosmology, all animals are said to have arisen through divine
creation, but only humans are said to have been created in the
likeness of God (Lewis, 2009, Ch. 9). An evolutionary perspective
casts doubt on all this, recasting the human species as one tip of one
branch of the tree of life, enjoying no particular special status.
Some have wanted to argue: perhaps <em>consciousness</em> is what sets
humans apart from the rest of nature. Yet empirical evidence has made
this view increasingly untenable.</p>

<p>
<em>The nature of consciousness:</em> The viability of philosophical
and scientific theories of consciousness is sometimes assessed in part
by asking whether the theory has plausible implications for other
animals (see the entries on
 <a href="../consciousness/">consciousness</a>,
 <a href="../consciousness-neuroscience/">the neuroscience of consciousness</a>).
 For example, some &ldquo;higher-order thought&rdquo; theories have
been criticized for apparently ruling out consciousness in any animal
without the relevant ability for higher-order thought (see the entry
on
 <a href="../consciousness-higher/">higher-order theories of consciousness</a>).
 Theories of consciousness that aspire to generality need to take due
account of the data from other animals, either by explaining how
consciousness can be realized in different kinds of nervous system or
else by arguing that the behaviors we see in animals can be achieved
non-consciously.</p>

<p>
<em>Ethics:</em> There is, on the face of it, a lot at stake morally
in the question of which animals are conscious (see the entries on
 <a href="../moral-animal/">the moral status of animals</a>
 and
 <a href="../grounds-moral-status/">the grounds of moral status</a>).
 Trillions of animals are slaughtered every year for food, research,
and other human purposes. Before their deaths, many of these animals
are subject to conditions that, if they are experienced by the animals
in anything like the way a human would experience them, amount to
cruelty. When the question of animal consciousness is under
consideration, our guilt or innocence as a civilization for an
enormous body of cruelty may hang in the balance.</p>

<p>
<em>The status of animal models in psychiatry and biomedical
research:</em> Large swathes of biomedical research use animals as
models for humans. When what is being modeled is a conscious state,
such as pain, fear, depression or anxiety, the validity of the model
seems to hinge on the animal also possessing a version of that state.
For example, a lot of research directly relevant to the treatment of
human pain is conducted on rats and other animals. Sometimes those
skeptical of attributing such states to animals are driven by a
concern that, if we attribute complex states like anxiety or
depression too liberally, we will end up overestimating the value of
animal models for developing new treatments (Taschereau-Dumouchel et
al. 2022).</p>

<p>
<em>Limits of scientific methodology and knowledge:</em> The science
of animal consciousness offers rich controversies about scientific
methodology and its limits. Marian Stamp Dawkins, a prominent animal
welfare scientist (Dawkins 1985, 1993, 2021), has written that
&ldquo;the mystery of consciousness remains. The explanatory gap is as
wide as ever and all the wanting in the world will not take us across
it&rdquo; (Dawkins 2012, pp. 171&ndash;172). While language may allow
humans to communicate their experience to others, this type of
evidence, critics allege, is not available for other animals. Joseph
LeDoux, another prominent critic, has described verbal report as the
gold standard of evidence in the science of consciousness, and has
warned against resting inferences on &ldquo;nonverbal behavioral
guesstimates&rdquo; (LeDoux 2019, p. 323).</p>

<p>
This skeptical attitude may initially seem hard to understand. It is a
matter of common sense to many people that some animals have conscious
experiences. If asked why they think their pets are conscious, people
often point to similarities between their behavior and human behavior.
For example, animals seem to express pleasure and displeasure and a
variety of emotions, their behavior seems to be motivated by seeking
food, comfort, social contact, and so on, and they seem aware of their
surroundings and able to learn from experience.</p>

<p>
Yet skeptics caution against overinterpreting similarities, especially
at the level of behavior. Their goal, typically, is not to argue that
animals <em>lack</em> consciousness, but to cast doubt on the
<em>quality of the evidence</em> cited in support of consciousness
attributions. They tend to emphasize that superficial observation of
quite similar behaviors even in closely related species does not
guarantee that the underlying mechanisms are the same (Povinelli &amp;
Giambrone 2000; Heyes 2008). Another key idea for skeptics is that we
underestimate the extent to which our own behavior is controlled by
unconscious circuitry. LeDoux has argued that much of what we call a
&ldquo;fear response&rdquo;, both in ourselves and in other mammals,
is in fact controlled by a &ldquo;defensive survival circuit&rdquo;
entirely distinct from the mechanisms involved in conscious
experience.</p>

<h2 id="ConCon">2. Concepts of Consciousness</h2>

<p>
The term &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; is notoriously ambiguous and
difficult to define. Sometimes, the word &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; is
invoked merely as a way of saying that a creature is awake rather than
asleep. On other occasions, the word is used to describe the ability
of organisms to perceive, attend and respond to features of their
environments, thus making them &ldquo;aware of&rdquo; or
&ldquo;conscious of&rdquo; those features. Attributions of
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; in these senses are relatively
uncontroversial. Clearly, animals across a wide variety of taxonomic
groups have sleep-wake cycles and can perceive, attend and respond to
their surroundings.</p>

<p>
In the science and philosophy of consciousness, two quite different
senses of &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; have been the main focus. One is
&ldquo;access consciousness&rdquo;, a term coined by Ned Block to
describe the availability of a mental representation for use in
reasoning and the rational control of action (Block 1995). The
distribution of access-consciousness in the animal kingdom will depend
on the distribution of reasoning and rational action (Hurley and Nudds
2006). Speech is not a requirement, though it is an important source
of evidence of access in humans.</p>

<p>
Block contrasted &ldquo;access consciousness&rdquo; with
<em>phenomenal consciousness</em>: the qualitative, subjective,
experiential side of consciousness. The term &ldquo;sentience&rdquo;
is also widely used in this context (Feigl 1958), though it sometimes
also has a narrower meaning (see the list at the end of this section).
Consciousness in the phenomenal sense is concerned with, in Thomas
Nagel&rsquo;s (1974) phrase, &ldquo;what it&rsquo;s like&rdquo;. Nagel
doubts our capacity to know, imagine, or describe in scientific,
objective terms <em>what</em> it is like to be a bat, but he assumes
that there <em>is</em> something it is like.</p>

<p>
For many researchers working on animal consciousness, phenomenal
consciousness is the sense of consciousness that matters most: the
sense most relevant for ethics and welfare, the one that is most
puzzling and mysterious, and the one that the emerging science of
animal consciousness should aspire to investigate (Barron and Klein
2016; Tye 2016; Godfrey-Smith 2019; Ginsburg and Jablonka 2019). In
other words, when investigating whether a group of animals are
conscious, our goal should be to find out whether there is
&ldquo;something it&rsquo;s like&rdquo; to be those
animals&mdash;whether they have a phenomenal perspective or
&ldquo;point of view&rdquo; on the world and on their own bodies.</p>

<p>
Importantly, the fact that we can draw a conceptual distinction
between access and phenomenal consciousness does <em>not</em> imply
that evidence of access cannot be evidence of phenomenal
consciousness. Consider an analogy: we can conceptually distinguish
&ldquo;fever&rdquo; from &ldquo;influenza&rdquo; and entertain the
possibility of fever without influenza and of influenza without fever,
but it does not follow that fever cannot be evidence of influenza.
Similarly, there might well be an evidential connection between
access-related properties and phenomenal consciousness due to a
constitutive or causal relationship between them. In practice,
empirical approaches to animal consciousness have posited evidential
connections between phenomenal consciousness and various cognitive
properties (Section 4.3).</p>

<p>
Both access and phenomenal consciousness can be distinguished from
<em>self-consciousness</em>, a subject&rsquo;s awareness of itself as
a being that persists through time (see the entries on
 <a href="../self-consciousness/">self-consciousness</a>,
 <a href="../self-consciousness-phenomenological/">phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness</a>).
 This is also a notoriously ambiguous term: there are multiple senses
in which a subject can be &ldquo;self-aware&rdquo;. These include:
keeping track of the effect one&rsquo;s actions on the stream of
sensory stimulation, thereby registering a self-other distinction
implicitly; an awareness of one&rsquo;s body as a physical object, or
as the medium of one&rsquo;s own perception and agency (bodily or
agential self-awareness); awareness of one&rsquo;s own mental states
(mental or experiential self-awareness); awareness of oneself as
perceived by others, or as a member of a social group (social
self-awareness); and awareness of oneself as a persistent character in
the narratives told by oneself and others (narrative self-awareness).
The most basic forms of self-awareness are likely to be very
widespread in the animal kingdom. By contrast, narrative forms are
likely to be much rarer and may be uniquely human.</p>

<p>
The rest of this article deals primarily with the attribution of
<em>phenomenal</em> consciousness to animals, mentioning other senses
of the word &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; only where relevant.</p>

<p>
When we attribute phenomenal consciousness to other animals, we are
positing that there are phenomenological facts: facts about what
it&rsquo;s like to be them. Given the variation in sensory abilities
and bodily forms of animals, their phenomenology must be hugely
varied. A glaring unsolved problem is that there is no standard
terminology for classifying the various possible forms of
phenomenology that may exist beyond the human case. All can agree that
generalizing everyday human terms may be problematic, but there are
many views about which terms are most useful for generalizing across
species and why. Terms that feature commonly in recent taxonomies
include:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>Sentience</em>, often (though not always) defined as the
ability to have affective (i.e. valenced) experiences such as pain or
pleasure.</li>

<li><em>Emotion</em>, with continuing debate over whether unconscious
emotion is possible (e.g. Winkielman and Berridge 2004 vs. Solms
2019).</li>

<li><em>Autonoetic</em> (&ldquo;self-knowing&rdquo;), <em>noetic</em>
(&ldquo;knowing&rdquo;), and <em>anoetic</em>
(&ldquo;non-knowing&rdquo;) consciousness (Tulving 2005; LeDoux 2022;
Vandekerckhove and Panksepp 2011).</li>

<li><em>Mental time-travel</em>, the ability to imagine or think about
the past or future, including episodic memory and future planning,
with continuing debate about whether this requires consciousness
(Tulving 1985).</li>

<li><em>Self-awareness</em> in various senses such as
embodied/sensorimotor, social, temporal and narrative.</li>

<li><em>Intersubjectivity, empathy, and awareness of other minds</em>
(Aaltola 2013; G&auml;rdenfors 2008; Gruen 2009, 2015).</li>

<li>Various grades of <em>conscious agency, control and
goal-directedness/teleology</em> (or &ldquo;teleonomy&rdquo;)
(Trestman 2018; Ginsburg and Jablonka 2019).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of these terms feature in other entries (see the entries on
 <a href="../cognition-animal/">animal cognition</a>,
 <a href="../comparative-cognition/">methods in comparative cognition</a>).
 It is fair to say the emerging science of animal consciousness
suffers at present from a lack of <em>agreed</em> taxonomies. Finding
such frameworks must be a priority for the future.</p>

<p>
What seems very unlikely, however, is that agreement will ever be
reached around a single sliding scale, allowing some animals to be
described as &ldquo;more conscious&rdquo; or &ldquo;less
conscious&rdquo; than others. While the idea of such a scale is
intelligible in theory (A. Lee 2023), a more realistic goal for animal
consciousness research in practice is to profile different animals
along various dimensions <em>without</em> attempting to aggregate
these dimensions into an overall degree of consciousness (Birch et al.
2020b; Dung and Newen 2023).</p>

<h2 id="DebConDifSomHisLan">3. Debating Continuity and Difference: Some Historical Landmarks</h2>

<p>
One encyclopedia entry cannot aim to survey the full history of
debates about animal consciousness. In describing a few major
landmarks, our aim is simply to convey why the topic has long been
controversial in modern Western science and philosophy&mdash;and, at
the same time, to give a sense of why many non-Western traditions have
found the idea far less controversial.</p>

<p>
Aristotle is often touted as a defender of human exceptionalism, but
his views are not easy to classify in today&rsquo;s categories. He
asserted that only humans had &ldquo;rational&rdquo; souls, while the
&ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;locomotive&rdquo; souls shared by
all animals endow them with instincts suited to their successful
reproduction and survival. The &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; soul seems much
closer to the modern idea of phenomenal consciousness than the
&ldquo;rational&rdquo; soul, suggesting that Aristotle was in fact
willing to attribute a basic form of consciousness to other animals
(Ginsburg and Jablonka 2019).</p>

<p>
Medieval authors in the Muslim and Christian world, such as Ibn Sina
and Peter Olivi, who developed sophisticated theories of human mental
faculties, applied their theories to nonhuman animals, emphasizing
continuity. However, it is fair to say that the assumption of an
absolute metaphysical divide between humans and other animals tightly
constrained thinking throughout this era (Adamson and Toivanen 2015
&ndash; see Other Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
Descartes is often singled out as the greatest critic of animal
consciousness in the modern Western tradition. His mechanistic
philosophy introduced the idea of a reflex to explain the behavior of
non-human animals, portraying animals as reflex-driven machines with
no intellectual capacities. He recognized that other animals have
sensations, but he took mechanistic explanation to be perfectly
adequate for explaining sensation, with no role for thought
(Cottingham 1978). It is not clear how Descartes&rsquo; categories map
on modern terms like &ldquo;phenomenal consciousness&rdquo;, so we
should be cautious about attributing to Descartes the view that there
was nothing it&rsquo;s like to be a non-human animal.</p>

<p>
Although experimental investigation of physiology was common in
Descartes&rsquo; time (and Descartes himself practiced and advocated
vivisection) the experimental study of animal <em>behavior</em> was
not. A few glimmers of experimental approaches to animal behavior can
be seen in the late 18th century (e.g., Barrington 1773; White
1789/1813). Soon thereafter, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Cuvier worked from
1804 until his death in 1838 on sexual and social behavior in captive
mammals. In the mid 19th century Alfred Russel Wallace (1867) argued
for an experimental approach to animal behavior, and Douglas
Spalding&rsquo;s (1872) experiments on instinctual feeding behaviors
in chicks were influential. Still, these authors made no attempt to
draw inferences to consciousness <em>from</em> behavior. Indeed,
Wallace famously regarded consciousness as inexplicable by evolution
or natural selection (Kottler 1974).</p>

<p>
Darwin, in both the <em>Origin of Species</em> (1859) and in the
<em>Descent of Man</em> (1871), devoted considerable attention to
animal behavior with the goal of demonstrating mental continuity among
species. Darwin relied heavily on anecdotes provided by his
correspondents, a project pursued after his death by his
prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Romanes (1882). Yet Darwin also carried
out experiments and made his own observations. In his final work he
describes experiments on the flexibility of earthworm behavior in
manipulating leaves, which he took to show considerable intelligence
(Darwin 1881; see also Crist 2002).</p>

<p>
T.H. Huxley (1874), an early champion of evolutionary theory
remembered as &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s bulldog&rdquo;, defended the idea
that consciousness leaves no imprint whatsoever on behavior or
cognition, writing: &ldquo;in men, as in brutes, there is no proof
that any state of consciousness is the cause of change in the motion
of the matter of the organism.&rdquo; This view has come to be known
as &ldquo;epiphenomenalism&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../epiphenomenalism/">epiphenomenalism</a>).
 Huxley reported a series of experiments on a frog, showing very
similar reflexive behavior even when its spinal cord had been severed,
or large portions of its brain removed. He argued that without a
brain, the frog could not be conscious, but since it could still do
the same sort of things that it could do before, consciousness is
superfluous to behavior (A. Klein 2019, Michel 2019).</p>

<p>
In <em>The Principles of Psychology</em> (1890), William James offered
an argument against epiphenomenalism that still stands up well.
Conscious experience, he argued, has all the hallmarks of a complex,
evolved adaptation. Think especially of the alignment between our
pains and pleasures and our biological needs:</p>

<blockquote>
if pleasures and pains have no efficacy, one does not see (without
some such <em>a priori</em> rational harmony as would be scouted by
the &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; champions of the automaton theory [i.e.
epiphenomenalism]) why the most noxious acts, such as burning, might
not give thrills of delight, and the most necessary ones, such as
breathing, cause agony. (James 1890/1918, pp. 143&ndash;144).
</blockquote>

<p>
James&rsquo;s point is that this adaptive alignment is best explained
by natural selection&mdash;but, <em>to be selected, it must have
effects.</em></p>

<p>
James promoted the idea of differing intensities of conscious
experience across the animal kingdom, an idea that was echoed by the
British psychologist Conwy Lloyd Morgan in his 1894 textbook <em>An
Introduction to Comparative Psychology</em>. Morgan had been very
skeptical of the anecdotal approach favored by Darwin and Romanes, but
he nonetheless came around to the Darwinian point of view about mental
continuity. Morgan held that inference in psychology begins with
introspective examination of one&rsquo;s own mind. Inferences
concerning other human minds rest on the principle that similar
behavior in other people has similar psychological causes to my own.
Inferences about other species then rest on the principle that
behavior similar to human behavior will likewise have similar causes.
Morgan called this the &ldquo;double inductive&rdquo; method, because
it involved two inductive steps: from self to other human, and from
human to other animal (Sober 2005). To counteract what he saw as the
anthropomorphic bias inherent in the double inductive method, Morgan
introduced a principle now known as Morgan&rsquo;s canon:</p>

<blockquote>
in no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise
of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome
of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale
(Morgan 1894, p.53) (for discussion, see the entries on
 <a href="../cognition-animal/">animal cognition</a>,
 <a href="../comparative-cognition/">methods in comparative cognition</a>).
 </blockquote>

<p>
The influence of Morgan across the Atlantic can be seen in Margaret
Floy Washburn&rsquo;s textbook <em>The Animal Mind</em> (1908).
Washburn endorsed Morgan&rsquo;s canon but, in contrast to many later
commentators, read it as an imperative to avoid attributing
<em>complex</em> conscious states where simpler ones will suffice, not
as opposing the attribution of consciousness to a wide range of
animals. She held that &ldquo;no one can prove the absence of
consciousness in even the simplest forms of living beings. It is
therefore perfectly allowable to speculate as to what may be the
nature of such consciousness, provided that the primitive organisms
concerned possess it&rdquo; (Washburn 1908, p. 37). The textbook
includes a rich discussion of the possible experiences of
single-celled protists, such as amoebae and paramecia, based on
observations of their behavior by Herbert S. Jennings (1906).</p>

<p>
The rise of behaviorism in American psychology in the early 20th
century, beginning with Thorndike&rsquo;s (1911) experiments on
animals learning by trial and error to escape &ldquo;puzzle
boxes&rdquo;, suggested a way forward for psychology that bypassed
questions of consciousness. However, even Thorndike&rsquo;s famous
&ldquo;law of effect&rdquo; refers to the animal&rsquo;s
&ldquo;satisfaction or discomfort&rdquo; (1911, p.244). It was with
the radical anti-mentalism of John B. Watson (1913, 1928) and later B.
F. Skinner (1953), both of whom strongly rejected any attempts to
explain animal behavior in terms of unobservable mental states, that
American psychology became, to a large extent, the science of behavior
alone.</p>

<p>
Yet pure behaviorism faced challenges from an early stage. Edward C.
Tolman (1932, 1948), studying rats in mazes, observed what he called
&ldquo;vicarious trial and error&rdquo;: moments where the rats
appeared to be pausing to mentally model the consequences of different
choices. At the time, this interpretation flew in the face of the
fundamental assumption of the behaviorist approach: that behavior was
determined by stimulus and reinforcement contingencies. Tolman&rsquo;s
conclusion was that the anti-mentalism of pure behaviorism would be a
fatal limitation, because &ldquo;behavior as behavior <em>is</em>
purposive and <em>is</em> cognitive. These purposes and cognitions are
of its immediate descriptive warp and woof.&rdquo; (Tolman 1932, p.
12) Modern neural recording techniques support the idea that rats
really do simulate alternative courses of action (Redish 2016).</p>

<p>
In Europe, ethological approaches provided a contrast with
American-style behaviorism. Ethology emphasized the importance of
integrating fieldwork with experimental science conducted on captive
animals, reflecting the different styles of its two seminal figures,
Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen (Burkhardt 2005). Lorenz and
Tinbergen explicitly sought to distance ethology from the purposive,
mentalistic, animal psychology of Bierens de Haan, while at the same
time distancing themselves from the lack of sensitivity to ecological
questions they detected in American psychology (Brigandt 2005). But
despite the distance from behaviorism, questions of consciousness were
still marginalized.</p>

<p>
Jacob von Uexkull was a notable dissenter, arguing that a genuinely
biological understanding of the mechanisms of perception and action
must relate them to the whole animal as an integrated perceiving and
acting subject. Von Uexkull coined the term <em>Umwelt</em> for the
environment as it has meaning for a given animal. He held that an
animal&rsquo;s Umwelt has a complementary structure to its
&ldquo;inner world&rdquo; (or &ldquo;phenomenal-&rdquo; or
&ldquo;self-world&rdquo;). Biologists decipher the animal&rsquo;s
subjective world through the system of signs that constitute its
Umwelt. Biology therefore requires treating animals not as
decomposable machines, but as &ldquo;subjects whose essential activity
consists of perceiving and acting.&rdquo; (von Uexkull 1934/1992, p.
320)</p>

<p>
In the 1970s, Donald Griffin, who made his reputation taking careful
physical measurements to prove that bats use echolocation, made a
considerable splash with his plea for a return to questions about
animal minds, especially animal consciousness. Griffin (1978) coined
the term &ldquo;cognitive ethology&rdquo; to describe this program,
which aimed to combine naturalistic observations of animal behavior
with attempts to understand animal minds in the context of evolution.
Griffin emphasized behavioral flexibility and versatility as the chief
source of evidence for consciousness, which he defined as &ldquo;the
subjective state of feeling or thinking about objects and
events&rdquo; (Griffin &amp; Speck 2004, p. 6). Although
Griffin&rsquo;s program was heavily criticized at the time (see Bekoff
&amp; Allen 1997), he played a crucial role in reintroducing
discussions of consciousness to the science of animal behavior and
cognition, paving the way for modern investigations of the
distribution and evolutionary origins of consciousness.</p>

<p>
The 2010s and 2020s have seen a visible resurgence of interest in the
topic. What has driven this turn back towards questions deliberately
put aside in the twentieth century? The rise of the science of human
consciousness has clearly played an important role (see the entry on
 <a href="../consciousness-neuroscience/">the neuroscience of consciousness</a>).
 Since the 1990s, consciousness science has gradually established
itself, premised in large part on its promise of clinical relevance to
humans. At the same time, it has always been heavily reliant on animal
research, especially research on the visual system of the Rhesus
macaque (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) (see the
 <a href="evidence.html">supplement</a>).
 An assumption of consciousness in at least other <em>primates</em>
has therefore become central to the field (see the entry on
 <a href="../cognition-animal/">animal cognition</a>,
 Section 3.3). Given this, we should not be surprised to find
consciousness researchers starting to take an interest in a wider
range of animals, partly with a view to finding new animal models.</p>

<p>
At the same time, many have been drawn to the topic by a very
different motive: a drive to assemble an evidence base to help people
advocate for animals in legal and policy settings. In these contexts,
the term &ldquo;sentience&rdquo; is usually used, and connotes a
special emphasis on experiences with a positive or negative quality,
such as pleasure and pain (see the entries on
 <a href="../pleasure/">pleasure</a>,
 <a href="../pain/">pain</a>).
 Respect for animals is now written into law in France, Peru, Quebec,
Spain, Sweden, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and recognition of
animals as sentient beings also features in the European Union&rsquo;s
Lisbon Treaty (World Animal Protection 2023). When drawing up
legislation concerning animal sentience, policy-makers need to decide
the legislation&rsquo;s scope: exactly <em>which</em> animals should
be recognized as sentient beings? This has led to particular interest
in animal taxa traditionally excluded from animal welfare laws, such
as decapod crustaceans (Crump et al. 2022).</p>

<p>
The two motivations sit uneasily together. Stevan Harnad, editor of
the journal <em>Animal Sentience</em>, has been open about his own
ethical motivations, and has a policy that the journal &ldquo;will not
publish studies in which animal subjects are harmed&rdquo; (Harnad
2016). Meanwhile, many of the techniques generating most excitement in
the neuroscience community are invasive. Animal consciousness research
today is a very broad church&mdash;broad enough to contain people with
background motivations in tension with each other.</p>

<p>
The story we have told so far, from Aristotle to Harnad, is focused on
the Western academy, in which the idea of animal consciousness has
often been viewed with a level of skepticism many find surprising. To
round out the picture, we need to highlight that many non-Western
traditions approach the topic in a very different, far less skeptical
way (Adamson and Edwards 2018).</p>

<p>
Of special note here are Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and related
Indian philosophical traditions that strongly emphasize mental
continuity between humans and other animals. They also place high
moral importance on the treatment of other animals, considering them
to be fellow sentient beings with feelings, perceptions and interests.
Traditionally, this is related to the idea of reincarnation or
rebirth: to be sentient is to be a possible form into which one might
be reborn, or in which one might have lived in a past life. Nonhuman
animal rebirths are generally seen as less favorable than human ones,
often being framed as a punishment or a trial. Vegetarianism is
widespread in these communities, although not all Buddhist or Hindu
traditions require it (see the entry on
 <a href="../ethics-indian-buddhism/">ethics in Indian Buddhism</a>).
 In Buddhism, the concept of sentience is closely connected to that of
life, leading to the idea, curious to Western ears, that plants are
neither sentient nor alive (Carpenter and Adamson 2018 &ndash; see
Other Internet Resources). Jainism, meanwhile, accepts a form of plant
sentience (see the entry on
 <a href="../jaina-philosophy/">Jaina philosophy</a>).
 Some Jain monastics adopt a diet based on fruit and nuts, harvestable
without lethal violence to plants. They also show great concern for
insects and other small creatures that might be harmed by farming or
in everyday life (Sen 2014).</p>

<p>
Many indigenous knowledge systems from around the world place a great
emphasis on nonhuman animal experience. In a paradigm labeled
&ldquo;animism&rdquo;, humanity is seen as part of a broader social
reality together with a diversity of other sentient beings, including
individual animals, as well as the spirits of natural phenomena and
places, plus ghosts or ancestral spirits of the deceased (Viveiros de
Castro 1998). For example, the Navajo National Code states that
&ldquo;All creation, from Mother Earth and Father Sky to the animals,
those who live in water, those who fly and plant life have their own
laws, and have rights and freedom to exist.&rdquo;
 (<a href="https://courts.navajo-nsn.gov/" target="other">Navajo National Code</a>).
 In the Navajo belief system, nonhuman animals are viewed as having
individual personalities, emotional experience, intelligence, the
ability to reason as constrained by their perceptions of the world,
and cultural traditions of shared knowledge passed between generations
of each of the Animal Peoples (Pavlik and Tsosie 2014, p. 42). Animism
is related to a cosmological picture shared by many cultures in which
humans and nonhuman animals at one point in time existed together as
peoples not yet differentiated by the physical forms that now set them
apart (Viveiros de Castro 1998; Reid et al., 1984, p 11). Not all
indigenous cultures regard <em>individual</em> nonhuman animals as
sentient. Alternatively, some attribute sentience to
<em>collective</em> entities representing entire species or guilds
(Viveiros de Castro 1998).</p>

<p>
For cultures that place a great emphasis on hunting, knowledge of
animal minds is often greatly valued. For example, in Dakota
tradition, immersive field knowledge of the behavioral habits and
subjective experience of animals is not only valued pragmatically (for
securing material resources) but as an intellectual and spiritual end
in itself (Eastman [Ohiyesa] 1904). In many hunting-oriented
indigenous peoples across the Americas as well as the global Far
North, great importance is placed on maintaining relationships of good
standing with nonhuman animal populations. Norms of respect and
consideration (for example, avoiding cruelty or wasteful slaughter)
are considered both morally and practically important, in part because
animals themselves are said to recognize this treatment and interact
differently with humans who practice it (Eastman [Ohiyesa] 1904;
Nadasdy 2007).</p>

<p>
Various forms of reincarnation belief are traditional to indigenous
peoples of North America and the far north (Mills and Slobodan 1994).
As in other reincarnationist traditions, these beliefs are related to
ethical views about the treatment of nonhuman animals. Many peoples
share the broad belief that spirits of animals will only choose to
reincarnate as the same species again if their way of life is allowed
to flourish, leading to an imperative to treat them with respect
(Mills 1994).</p>

<p>
A philosophical view prevalent among indigenous cultures throughout
the Americas is what Viveiros de Castro calls &ldquo;Amerindian
perspectivism&rdquo;. On this view, the creatures we perceive as
animals perceive themselves as humans, their bodily attributes as
clothing and decorations, their burrows as houses or villages, and
their habits and behavior as forms of culture. Their physical forms
are &ldquo;envelopes&rdquo; or &ldquo;masks&rdquo;: mere outward
appearances to other species (Viveiros de Castro 1998). On this view,
other animals perceive themselves as persons and their own species as
a people.</p>

<p>
In wrapping up this brief overview, we should note some initial signs
that Abrahamic faiths may be moving into closer alignment with the
less anthropocentric pictures just considered. Strikingly, Pope
Francis explicitly rejected &ldquo;tyrannical anthropocentrism&rdquo;
and argued that nonhuman animals have the capacity for suffering,
intrinsic autonomy, purpose and spiritual potency (an ability to
relate to God), adding that humans therefore owe them moral
obligations directly (Francis 2015).</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, views of personhood, mental capacities, and moral
status in nonhuman animals show vast diversity across the
world&rsquo;s cultures, and this section has barely scratched the
surface of this diversity. Notably, though, the idea that a capacity
for conscious experience is possessed by many animals, rather than
being uniquely human, is very widespread. In a global and historical
context, the Cartesian view starts to look like an aberration.</p>

<h2 id="MetChaForSciAniCon">4. Methodological Challenges for the Science of Animal Consciousness</h2>

<h3 id="DisQuePheQue">4.1 The Distribution Question and the Phenomenological Question</h3>

<p>
A distinction between two questions&mdash;first introduced in an
earlier version of this article (Allen 2000)&mdash;has shaped the way
researchers think about the aims of animal consciousness research:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <em>Distribution Question</em>: Can we know which animals
beside humans are conscious?</li>

<li>The <em>Phenomenological Question</em>: Can we know what, if
anything, the experiences of animals are like?</li>
</ul>

<p>
In &ldquo;What is it like to be a bat?&rdquo; Thomas Nagel (1974)
assumes that there <em>is</em> something that it is like to be a bat,
focusing on what he argues is the scientifically intractable problem
of knowing what the bat&rsquo;s experiences are like. Many would find
Nagel&rsquo;s assumption reasonable: bats are, after all, our fellow
mammals. But as we look further away from humans on the tree of life,
attributions of conscious experience become more and more
controversial.</p>

<p>
In addressing both questions, we face an instance of the problem of
other minds (see the entry on
 <a href="../other-minds/">other minds</a>).
 Even in the human case, there is room for disagreement about what
exactly justifies our conviction that the people around us have
conscious experiences like our own. It seems likely, though, that
inference to the best explanation (also known in philosophy as
&ldquo;abduction&rdquo;; see the entry on
 <a href="../abduction/">abduction</a>)
 plays an important role. Other people constantly share their
experiences verbally, engaging in rich discussions about subtle
patterns of similarity and difference. They also display non-verbal
markers, such as facial expressions. And there is, for the most part,
a high level of congruence between the verbal reports and the
non-verbal behaviors. This complex pattern of behavior is well
explained by the hypothesis that the vast majority of humans have
conscious experiences of broadly comparable kinds, with similar causes
and effects. It is very poorly explained by the hypothesis that other
people are philosophical zombies (see the entry on
 <a href="../zombies/">zombies</a>)
 in the grip of a mysterious, all-encompassing mass delusion.
Skepticism about consciousness in other humans is merely philosophical
skepticism&mdash;no one proposes it as a serious basis for actions and
policies in the real world.</p>

<p>
By contrast, when people doubt whether fishes, octopuses or bees have
conscious experiences, their skepticism is not merely philosophical.
In other animals, linguistic evidence&mdash;clearly important in the
human case&mdash;is absent. Although there have been attempts to teach
human-like languages to members of other species, none has ever
reached a level of conversational ability that would solve this
problem adequately (Anderson 2004). Furthermore, except for some
language-related work with parrots and dolphins, such approaches are
generally limited to those animals most like ourselves, particularly
the great apes. This will not help us with bees.</p>

<p>
Because phenomenal consciousness is assumed to be private or
subjective, it is sometimes said to be beyond the reach of objective
scientific methods altogether (e.g., Nagel 1974). This claim might be
taken in either of two ways. It is one thing to say that the
Distribution Question is beyond the reach of scientific methods, and
another thing to say the Phenomenological Question is out of reach. At
best, the privacy of conscious experience supports a skeptical view
only about the Phenomenological Question. To support a negative
conclusion about the Distribution Question, one must also assume that
consciousness has no explanatory connection to any behavior other than
linguistic behavior. For if consciousness does explain some aspects of
non-linguistic behavior, inference to the best explanation might, in
principle at least, license inferences to its presence (Tye 2016;
Andrews 2020).</p>

<p>
Moreover, if particular conscious states have characteristic effects
on behavior (as might be true of pain, for example), then the same
strategy might be pursued to elucidate some features of the
phenomenology of other animals. Admittedly, though, some aspects may
remain out of reach because of our inability, as humans, to grasp what
it would be like to experience them. This idea is particularly
plausible when thinking about the phenomenology associated with
sensory abilities we lack, such as echolocation.</p>

<p>
Our focus in the rest of this section will be on recent attempts to
gain traction on the Distribution Question.</p>

<h3 id="DisAboFunCon">4.2 Disagreements about the Function(s) of Consciousness</h3>

<p>
If there were agreement about the function of consciousness, that
would provide a solid platform for animal consciousness research. We
could test whether other animals have brain mechanisms that support
the relevant function.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, contemporary consciousness science contains a wide
range of views about the function of consciousness. To review the
various hypotheses would be the work of another encyclopedia entry. To
give an indicative selection, consciousness has recently been claimed
to be implicated in forming subjectively justified beliefs (Lau 2022),
&ldquo;reducing the time scale over which preprogrammed behaviors can
be altered&rdquo; (Lacalli 2024); &ldquo;neural credit and blame
allocation&rdquo; (Fitch 2022); supplying the agent with a sense of
self (Marchetti 2022); acting &ldquo;as a mental currency of sorts,
which not only endows conscious mental states with intrinsic value but
also makes it possible for conscious agents to compare vastly
different experiences in a common subject-centred space&rdquo;
(Cleeremans and Tallon-Boudry 2022); and managing &ldquo;a complex
body with high degrees of freedom&rdquo; (Veit 2023b).</p>

<p>
There are recurring themes. Many find plausible the idea that
consciousness is linked to valuation, decision-making, prioritization,
learning, action control, formation of beliefs and intentions, or some
combination of these. It plausibly sits close to the center of an
animal&rsquo;s mental life, doing important things. Beyond this, there
is strikingly little agreement. Many of the proposals are compatible
with each other, so it could be that consciousness performs most or
even all of the functions speculatively credited to it. But there is
no agreement about this either.</p>

<p>
It is possible to doubt whether the question is well posed at all.
Should we even be asking about the functions of consciousness <em>in
general</em>, or should we instead expect different states of
consciousness to serve different functions (Ludwig 2023; Shepherd and
Bayne in press)? For example, it might be that the function of
dreaming has little to do with the function of conscious wakefulness.
If there is indeed variation in the function of conscious states, a
way forward might be to characterize those particular states for which
our grip on their function seems strongest and look for these states
in other animals.</p>

<h3 id="SeaForMarConRolThe">4.3 The Search for Markers and the Contested Role of Theory</h3>

<p>
Do we need a well-established theory of the nature and/or function of
consciousness before we investigate whether other animals have it? If
we do, the idea of a science of animal consciousness may be rather
premature, given the disorienting level of disagreement about the
nature and function of consciousness in the human case (see the entry
on
 <a href="../consciousness-neuroscience/">the neuroscience of consciousness</a>).</p>
 
<p>
But perhaps we do not. After all, in the early stages of the
scientific investigation of any natural phenomenon, samples of the
phenomenon must be tentatively identified using fallible markers
(signs, symptoms) rather than complete theories. Early scientists
initially identified gold by its outward characteristics (e.g.
shininess, malleability) rather than by its atomic essence, knowledge
of which had to await thorough investigation of many candidate
examples&mdash;some of which turned out to be gold and some not.
Perhaps we should study consciousness in roughly the same way we would
study other natural kinds. Indeed, Tim Bayne, Nicholas Shea and
collaborators have explicitly called for all consciousness science
(including work on humans) to pursue an empirically-driven
&ldquo;natural kind approach&rdquo; (Shea and Bayne 2010; Bayne et al.
2024; Shea 2012). Many animal consciousness researchers have had
thoughts along similar lines (Allen 2000; Tye 2016; Andrews 2020).</p>

<p>
The science of animal consciousness is still at a relatively early
stage, where the key question is still: what <em>are</em> the most
credible behavioral and neural markers of consciousness, and where are
these markers to be found in the natural world? Identifying and
studying clusters of such markers is only a first step, to be followed
by investigating the underlying brain mechanisms responsible for
producing those markers, leading ultimately to better, more secure
theories. A marker of consciousness is unlikely to be sufficient for
the presence of consciousness, any more than being shiny is sufficient
for being gold. Indeed, even a large set of markers, taken together,
is unlikely to be even jointly sufficient. But good markers <em>raise
the probability</em> of consciousness being present, guiding future
research to the most promising candidates and informing theory
development.</p>

<p>
Yet here we run into a problem: unlike in the case of gold, there is
substantial disagreement even about the <em>initial markers</em> for
conscious experience, at least once we set aside verbal report (Taylor
2023). People with different theoretical sympathies tend to gravitate
towards very different sets of markers.</p>

<p>
For example, people sympathetic to a global workspace theory of
consciousness will take certain functional markers, especially forms
of global ignition, cross-modal integration, working memory and
attention, as promising markers (Dehaene 2014; Mashour et al. 2020;
Shea and Heyes 2010). Meanwhile, those sympathetic to the integrated
information theory will doubt the relevance of functional markers of
any kind, instead emphasizing the structural markers their theory
views as especially important (Albantakis et al. 2024; for details on
all these theories, see the entry on
 <a href="../consciousness-neuroscience/">the neuroscience of consciousness</a>).
 This suggests that one cannot proceed in a fully theory-neutral
manner. Even if one avoids explicitly committing to any particular
theory, one&rsquo;s preferred list of markers will betray implicit
theoretical commitments.</p>

<h3 id="TheLigApp">4.4 Theory-Light Approaches</h3>

<p>
Widespread recognition of the above problem has led to the development
of theory-light approaches, which do not seek to avoid theoretical
commitment altogether but aim to reduce these commitments to the
<em>bare minimum</em> necessary to organize a coherent program of
empirical work (Birch 2022). The hope is that a sufficiently minimal
commitment can be a &ldquo;goldilocks&rdquo; principle: common ground
for a wide coalition of researchers, yet still contentful enough to
provide a useful inclusion criterion when we draw up lists of
markers.</p>

<p>
As part of this broader trend, Jonathan Birch (one of the co-authors
of the present entry) has proposed a program built around the
<em>facilitation hypothesis</em>: the hypothesis that conscious
perception of a stimulus facilitates, relative to unconscious
perception, a cluster of cognitive abilities in relation to that
stimulus (Birch 2022). Which cognitive abilities are the relevant
ones? The evidential picture in the human case is changing rapidly,
with new evidence constantly providing new information about the
nature of the cognitive abilities conscious perception facilitates.
The proposal is that, at any given time, the search for consciousness
in non-human animals should be guided by the latest evidence from
humans. The list of markers, then, requires constant revision as new
evidence comes in. Yet the general idea that conscious perception
stands in a facilitative relationship to a cluster of cognitive
abilities is one that has steadily accumulated support across time,
despite the waxing and waning fortunes of specific theories and our
ever-evolving understanding of the precise nature of the facilitated
abilities.</p>

<p>
The facilitation hypothesis is one example of a minimal theoretical
commitment that constrains lists of markers without overcommitting to
a controversial theory. Simona Ginsburg and Eva Jablonka&rsquo;s
Unlimited Associative Learning (UAL) framework can be seen as another
proposal in the same family, albeit less minimalist (Ginsburg and
Jablonka 2007a, b, 2019). It postulates a link between consciousness
and a <em>specific</em> package of cognitive
abilities&mdash;&ldquo;unlimited associative learning&rdquo;&mdash;and
not just a link between consciousness and a provisional, revisable
cluster. Unlimited associative learning is a package of advanced
associative learning abilities including: (i) the ability to learn
about novel, compound stimuli (such as a new combination of a sound, a
sight and an odor), (ii) the ability to forge long chains of
associations in an open-ended way, (iii) the ability to learn
associations between stimuli separated in time (trace conditioning),
and (iv) the ability to flexibly revalue an outcome (e.g. revaluing a
source of reward as a source of punishment). Naturally, to postulate
that consciousness facilitates <em>this specific set</em> of cognitive
abilities is more contentious (but also more contentful) than to
postulate merely that it stands in a facilitative relationship to
cognition.</p>

<p>
Todd Feinberg and Jon Mallatt (2013, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020) can also
be situated within this broad &ldquo;theory-light&rdquo; trend. They
propose that the search for markers be guided by two fundamental
commitments:</p>

<blockquote>
(1) If an animal has neural pathways that carry mapped, point-by-point
signals from the sensed environment, from different senses (e.g.
vision, touch, hearing), and if these sensory maps converge in the
brain, then that animal consciously experiences a unified, mapped,
multisensory image of the environment; (2) If an animal shows complex
operant learning, i.e. learning and remembering from experience to
avoid harmful stimuli and to approach helpful stimuli, then that
animal has the negative and positive feelings of affective
consciousness. (Feinberg and Mallatt 2020, p. 7)
</blockquote>

<p>
This is another attempt to find the common ground in contemporary
consciousness science. As with the others, it seems unlikely that all
theoretical camps would agree, but plausible that many would.</p>

<p>
How do these three &ldquo;theory-light&rdquo; proposals (the
facilitation hypothesis, UAL, and Feinberg and Mallatt&rsquo;s
framework) relate to each other? All three agree about the likely
relevance of sophisticated forms of learning, while agreeing that the
simplest forms of classical conditioning are not enough. Meanwhile,
their differences help us see the trade-offs involved in trying to
find common ground across diverse groups of researchers while, at the
same time, trying to constrain the search for markers. The
facilitation hypothesis is the &ldquo;lightest&rdquo; of the three,
avoiding assumptions about the types of cognitive abilities that are
facilitated by consciousness, instead demanding sensitivity to the
rapidly changing human evidence. The other two add further theoretical
commitments that constrain the list of relevant markers much more
tightly&mdash;at the cost of creating a larger group of
discontents.</p>

<h3 id="MigQueLacDetAns">4.5 Might the Questions Lack Determinate Answers?</h3>

<p>
In most debates about animal consciousness, it is tacitly assumed that
there are determinate facts out there to uncover. That is, for a
particular mental state of a particular animal (like that of a bat
hunting insects through echolocation), there will be a fact of the
matter as to whether there is (or is not) something it&rsquo;s like to
be in that state. Not everyone agrees this assumption is well
founded.</p>

<p>
One challenge comes from the thought that there might be borderline
cases of phenomenal consciousness, just as there are borderline cases
of being bald, tall or old (see the entry on
 <a href="../vagueness/">vagueness</a>).
 Perhaps some animals have only states in a gray area between
&ldquo;something it&rsquo;s like&rdquo; and &ldquo;nothing it&rsquo;s
like&rdquo;. Even the idea of a small borderline region runs up
against an &ldquo;intuition of sharpness&rdquo; (Antony 2006, 2008):
it seems counterintuitive to many that there could be indeterminacy
not just in the <em>content</em> of a phenomenal state but in
<em>whether it is phenomenal at all</em> (Tye 2021). Those who posit
borderline cases usually grant that the idea is counterintuitive but
see even more serious problems with a sharp, sudden &ldquo;lights
on&rdquo; moment (Papineau 1993; Schwitzgebel 2023; Godfrey-Smith
2020a, b).</p>

<p>
A bolder challenge comes from deflationary forms of materialism that
imply radical indeterminacy: large classes of beings such that there
is no determinate fact of the matter about whether there is, or is
not, something it&rsquo;s like to be them (Papineau 2002; G. Lee 2019;
Carruthers 2018, 2019). One way to motivate the challenge begins from
a certain picture of how the concept of phenomenal consciousness
works. On this picture, we construct the concept by pointing
introspectively to particular conscious experiences (e.g. the
experience of a red sunset, or of the smell of rotten eggs) and
deriving from these instances a concept of &ldquo;that sort of
state&rdquo; (Carruthers 2019, pp. 156&ndash;157). For the
deflationary materialist, this inward pointing is unlikely to succeed
in picking out a single natural kind. It is much more likely to
gesture indeterminately towards a family of kinds. When we turn to
other animals, many will have some but not all of these kinds (or will
have the same kinds to a lesser degree), and it will be indeterminate
whether their perceptual states qualify as &ldquo;that sort of
state&rdquo; (for responses, see Birch 2020; Black 2020).</p>

<p>
A distinct challenge comes from &ldquo;strong illusionists&rdquo; who
maintain (like earlier eliminative materialists; see the entry on
 <a href="../materialism-eliminative/">eliminative materialism</a>)
 that, even in the human case, the concept of phenomenal consciousness
fails to refer to anything (Dennett 2017; Frankish 2016; Kammerer
2022). If this view is correct, then we are not phenomenally conscious
and neither is any other animal. What happens to debates about animal
consciousness, on this view? Dung (2022) has suggested the
consequences are less revisionary than they initially seem to be. For
we can still investigate the distribution of
&ldquo;quasi-phenomenal&rdquo; properties, where a quasi-phenomenal
property is one that we &ldquo;typically misrepresent as
phenomenal&rdquo;. This seems likely to leave the debate largely
unchanged, with existing theories and hypotheses about phenomenal
consciousness now rebranded as theories and hypotheses about
&ldquo;quasi-phenomenal&rdquo; consciousness.</p>

<h3 id="ResAgrAboAny">4.6 Can Researchers Agree About Anything?</h3>

<p>
While many foundational issues for the science of animal consciousness
are clearly unresolved, it would be wrong to infer that no points of
wide agreement exist among researchers. In 2012,
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131109230457/http:/fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf" target="other">The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness</a>,
 signed by 22 neuroscientists, highlighted that &ldquo;the weight of
evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the
neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Nonhuman animals,
including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including
octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&rdquo; In 2024,
the
 <a href="https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nydeclaration/declaration" target="other">New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness</a>,
 declared &ldquo;wide agreement&rdquo; that there is &ldquo;strong
scientific support for attributions of conscious experience to other
mammals and to birds&rdquo; and &ldquo;at least a realistic
possibility of conscious experience in all vertebrates (including
reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) and many invertebrates (including,
at minimum, cephalopod mollusks, decapod crustaceans, and
insects)&rdquo;. Over 500 scientists and philosophers signed the New
York Declaration in the weeks following its launch.</p>

<p>
The claim of &ldquo;strong scientific support&rdquo; might be taken as
implying that, at least for mammals and birds, it is time to shift
from the Distribution Question to the Phenomenological Question, given
that so many reasonable approaches to the topic agree that <em>at
least</em> these animals are conscious. There has been a trend in this
direction recently, with various researchers moving on from the
question of whether mammals and birds are conscious at all and instead
attempting to create taxonomies of specific states, forms, gradations,
or dimensions of conscious experience. Kristin Andrews (2024) has even
advocated shifting to the phenomenological question for <em>all</em>
animals, not just mammals and birds, intentionally reviving the
program advocated by Washburn in 1908 (see Section 3). Meanwhile,
Hakwan Lau (2024) has argued that the New York Declaration exaggerates
the level of support for attributing phenomenal consciousness to
mammals and birds. These disagreements hinge on how we interpret
specific empirical studies, some of which are discussed in the
 <a href="evidence.html">supplement</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="EvoBigPic">5. Evolutionary Big Pictures</h2>

<p>
Although the science of animal consciousness has insecure, contested
foundations, many authors feel the current evidence nonetheless
constrains our big pictures enough to make painting them a worthwhile
exercise. These pictures are inevitably somewhat speculative, but they
can make contact with empirical evidence at many points. A rough
distinction can be drawn between expansive big pictures, which
entertain the idea of consciousness in fishes and at least some
invertebrates, and narrow big pictures, which limit consciousness to
just amniotes (mammals, birds, reptiles) or to an even narrower subset
of animals.</p>

<p>
For those offering expansive pictures, three lineages stand out as
especially promising candidates for consciousness: the vertebrates
(including amniotes, amphibians and fishes), the cephalopod mollusks,
and the arthropods. These groups contain animals with large, complex,
active bodies and brains capable of representing the spatial structure
of the world around them (Trestman 2013a, Coombs and Trestman 2024).
They display many traits suggested as plausible markers of
consciousness. Feinberg and Mallatt (2016) argue in detail that
precisely these three lineages satisfy their neuro-architectural and
behavioral criteria. Godfrey-Smith (2016, 2020a), despite entertaining
the idea of consciousness in a wider range of invertebrates, seems to
agree that the evidence is strongest in these lineages, as does Veit
(2023a).</p>

<p>
What is a &ldquo;complex active body&rdquo;? One of the co-authors of
the present article, Michael Trestman (2013a, 2018; Coombs and
Trestman 2024), has proposed a collection of traits that jointly
define this idea. These include: flexible, jointed appendages with
multiple degrees of freedom and adaptations for high-speed locomotion
or object manipulation, and true eyes and other distal senses.
Trestman then proposes that control of a complex active body requires
&ldquo;basic cognitive embodiment&rdquo;: a set of cognitive abilities
that extract stable spatial information from unstable, dynamic
sensorimotor information. He hypothesizes consciousness to be the
evolved solution to the problems of basic cognitive embodiment. What
allows consciousness to play this role? Its temporal structure: a
short-term subjective past recursively constituted by a sequence of
retained &ldquo;moment-phases&rdquo;, and a branching short-term
subjective future composed of a tree-structure of predicted
moment-phases (Husserl 1905/2019, 1907/1997; Trestman 2013b, 2018,
2023; Yoshimi 2016). This proposal shares Merker&rsquo;s (2005) focus
on the role of consciousness in real-time action control.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Ginsburg and Jablonka&rsquo;s (2019) &ldquo;unlimited
associative learning&rdquo; (UAL) framework, already discussed in
Section 4, has converged on the same lineages for different reasons.
UAL, recall, is a package of advanced learning abilities, including
the ability to learn about novel, compound stimuli, to form long,
open-ended chains of associations through second-order conditioning,
to learn associations across temporal gaps (trace conditioning), and
to flexibly revalue stimuli and actions. Ginsburg and Jablonka argue
that UAL is a &ldquo;transition marker&rdquo; for the evolution of
phenomenal consciousness. In calling it a &ldquo;transition
marker&rdquo;, they do not mean to imply that it could not, even in
principle (or in AI), be achieved unconsciously. Rather, they mean
that against the background of assumptions in play when thinking about
the evolution of consciousness (e.g. that we are discussing
biologically embodied animals with nervous systems), the presence of
UAL, when found in an animal, is a compelling sign that it is
conscious. Even this is controversial, of course (see the nine
commentaries on Birch et al. 2020a). UAL is probably present, they
argue, in cephalopod mollusks and arthropods as well as in vertebrates
(2019, p. 238).</p>

<p>
If any view in this general area is on the right lines, consciousness
is likely to be an evolutionarily ancient adaptation of the
vertebrates, the cephalopods and the arthropods, all of whom face the
problems of controlling a complex active body and are plausibly
capable of UAL. This leaves open the question of whether it evolved
separately three times or just once, in the worm-like common ancestor
of the three lineages (Godfrey-Smith 2016, 2020a).</p>

<p>
While expansive pictures seem to be enjoying a surge in popularity,
narrow pictures still have prominent defenders. LeDoux&rsquo;s
picture, premised on a higher-order theory of consciousness (see the
entry on
 <a href="../consciousness-higher/">higher-order theories of consciousness</a>),
 appears at first glance to portray consciousness as uniquely human:
&ldquo;Human consciousness depends on unparalleled cognitive processes
that are entwined with language and culture, and is enabled by
circuits with unique properties. The evolutionary past of human
consciousness &hellip; is, in my view, shallow rather than deep&rdquo;
(LeDoux, 2019, p. 316). On closer inspection, though, LeDoux&rsquo;s
uniqueness claim is restricted to the most advanced form of
consciousness in his taxonomy, &ldquo;autonoetic&rdquo; (self-knowing)
consciousness. The simplest, &ldquo;anoetic&rdquo; form is plausibly
present in other mammals (LeDoux et al. 2023). Meanwhile, Nicholas
Humphrey (2022) speculatively links phenomenal consciousness to
warm-bloodedness, arguing that it is probably the preserve of mammals
and birds.</p>

<p>
All these evolutionary big pictures have some value, but it is crucial
that the study of animal consciousness is about more than
<em>just</em> big pictures, given their substantially speculative
nature. Focused experimental work on particular species also has an
essential role. Our
 <a href="evidence.html">supplement</a>
 aims to provide an entry point to the debates around some of the most
important recent studies.</p>

<h2 id="LooFut">6. Looking to the future</h2>

<p>
The first archived version of this article, published in 1997, ended
on a note of cautious optimism:</p>

<blockquote>
Philosophers have shown themselves rather more willing to theorize on
the basis of what they thought animals could or could not do rather
than on the basis of the available empirical evidence about animal
behavior. The topic of animal consciousness is still taboo for many
psychologists. But interdisciplinary work between philosophers and
behavioral scientists is beginning to lay the groundwork for treating
some questions about consciousness in a philosophically sophisticated
yet empirically tractable way. (Allen 1997)
</blockquote>

<p>
Three decades later, this &ldquo;groundwork&rdquo; amounts to an
expansive literature and a vibrant emerging field, full of vigorous
debate and attracting significant public attention. The
&ldquo;taboo&rdquo; of the past has weakened.</p>

<p>
Fields need stable institutions, however, and animal consciousness
research at present still lacks a dedicated professional society or
regular conference (comparable to, for example, the Association for
the Scientific Study of Consciousness), let alone substantial
dedicated funding streams. In large part, the field consists of
synthesizing research done under other umbrellas (typically animal
cognition, animal behavior), marshaling that evidence in service of
abductive arguments for subjective experience. That work is essential,
but new insights into these questions are most likely to come from
sustained programs of experimental work overtly dedicated to
investigating markers of consciousness.</p>

<p>
We can only hope that the 2050 version of this article will be able to
report that the old taboos have been smashed, and that animal
consciousness research is a well-established and well-supported (not
just &ldquo;emerging&rdquo;) field of interdisciplinary collaboration
between science and philosophy.</p>
