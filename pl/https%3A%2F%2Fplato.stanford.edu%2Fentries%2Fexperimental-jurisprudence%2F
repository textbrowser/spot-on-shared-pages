<p>
Experimental jurisprudence (or &ldquo;X-Jur&rdquo;) addresses
questions of jurisprudence or legal philosophy by complementing
traditional philosophical analysis with empirical methods. Often those
methods include survey experiments that examine laypeople&rsquo;s
intuitions about legal-philosophical thought experiments and concepts
of legal significance (e.g., causation, intent, reasonableness). Other
times, experimental jurisprudence focuses on the cognitive processes
underlying legal reasoning. This entry reviews representative work in

<h2 id="GenOve">1. A General Overview</h2>

<p>
Experimental jurisprudence uses empirical methods&mdash;often modeled
on the methods of experimental psychology&mdash;to study theoretical
or philosophical questions about law (see Prochownik 2021; Sommers
2021; Tobia 2022). This includes questions within both general (e.g.,
about the necessary features of law and law&rsquo;s relationship to
morality) and particular jurisprudence, regarding specific legal
concepts: What is the relationship between contract and promise? What
justifies criminal punishment? And what does tort law&rsquo;s standard
of reasonable care require? The remainder of Section 1 provides a
detailed introduction to the field, situating it in relation to more
traditional approaches towards jurisprudence
 (<a href="#SitExpJurWitJur">&sect;1.1</a>)
 and outlining differing conceptions of it
 (<a href="#ConExpJur">&sect;1.2</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="SitExpJurWitJur">1.1 Situating Experimental Jurisprudence Within Jurisprudence</h3>

<p>
This entry assumes a broad conception of &ldquo;jurisprudence&rdquo;,
which treats it interchangeably with &ldquo;legal philosophy&rdquo; or
&ldquo;philosophy of law&rdquo; (see, e.g., Dickson 2022: 1), to refer
to the scholarly investigation of theoretical questions about law.
Jurisprudence is often divided into general and particular (or
special, or specific) jurisprudence. &ldquo;General&rdquo;
jurisprudence concerns the nature of law in general (Plunkett &amp;
Shapiro 2017: 137), or the fundamental features necessary to,
essential to, or associated with law (e.g., Schauer 2015).
&ldquo;Particular&rdquo; jurisprudence examines philosophical or
theoretical questions about specific legal areas (e.g., contract law
or criminal law), often in the context of a particular legal
jurisdiction (e.g., American) or tradition (e.g., common law).
Experimental jurisprudence scholarship engages in both projects (see
 <a href="#GenExpJur">&sect;2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#ParExpJur">&sect;2.2</a>,
 respectively).</p>

<p>
To situate experimental jurisprudence within the broader field of
jurisprudence, it is useful to consider that both general and
particular jurisprudence have traditionally used conceptual analysis,
thought experimentation, and appeals to intuition (see Langlinais
&amp; Leiter 2016). To cite two prominent examples in general
jurisprudence, Raz (1975 [1990]) describes a society of angels as a
means of showing that there could be legal systems which are not
coercive (see
 <a href="#ConRul">&sect;2.1.1</a>),
 and Hart (1958) and Fuller (1958) explore the role of text and
purpose in legal interpretation by considering hypothetical violations
of the text of a &ldquo;no vehicles in the park&rdquo; rule (see
 <a href="#LegInt">&sect;2.2.5</a>).
 Both thought experiments aimed to trigger intuitions that are
supposedly shared by a wider audience (see
 <a href="#IntExpNotOrdPeoMatForJur">&sect;3.2.2</a>
 for discussion of the relevant audience). In particular
jurisprudence, there are similar appeals to &ldquo;our&rdquo; shared
beliefs, concepts, or intuitions. Consider the concept of causation
that is at the heart of criminal and tort law. In their foundational
work on causation in the law, Hart and Honor&eacute; regard &ldquo;the
plain man&rsquo;s notions of causation&rdquo; (1959: 1) as relevant to
the law. In this spirit, they describe two principles that allegedly
characterize causal reasoning among ordinary people (the contrasts
drawn between normal and abnormal events, and between free and
intentional human actions and other events; 1985: 33). Similarly,
court decisions often refer to commonsense intuitions and the ordinary
meaning of causal terms (Macleod 2019). Despite important criticisms
of these traditional methods (e.g., Langlinais &amp; Leiter 2016; Nye
2022), conceptual analysis and/or appeals to intuitions are still
common in much of contemporary general (see Flanagan &amp; Hannikainen
2022: 1666) and particular (see Tobia 2022: 791&ndash;800)
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>
Why might traditional jurisprudence appeal to shared intuitions or
understandings (in
 <a href="#IntExpNotOrdPeoMatForJur">&sect;3.2.2</a>.
 we discuss the philosophical debate about whose intuitions are
shared: everyone&rsquo;s, laypeople&rsquo;s, or experts)? One answer
is to study concepts. Examining ordinary intuitions about law informs
our analysis of the <em>concept</em> of law. Another answer is to
analyze objects, taking ordinary intuitions about law to clarify the
<em>nature</em> of law, or the <em>object</em> &lsquo;law&rsquo;, not
just our concept of it. Most ambitiously, jurisprudence could use
intuitions or conceptual analysis to clarify law&rsquo;s necessary
properties&mdash;not just the object of law around <em>here</em>, but
law as it could exist <em>anywhere</em>.</p>

<p>
There are great debates about which of these projects are at the heart
of central works in jurisprudence. Those debates sometimes describe
the various goals of conceptual analysis as either
&ldquo;modest&rdquo; or &ldquo;immodest&rdquo; (Himma 2019: 32),
employing a language initially developed by Jackson (1998). This
modest/immodest terminology can invite confusion, and it involves
questions that fall beyond this entry&rsquo;s scope (see Jackson 2021;
Nye 2017 for some complications). To avoid these terminological
difficulties, we set aside that terminology in this entry, focusing
instead on the three different types of projects outlined above.
Conceptual analysis could be taken to illuminate concepts, objects, or
necessary properties. Again, there are debates about the aims of
various traditional jurisprudential projects: Is a particular
philosopher analyzing our concept of law, the object
&ldquo;law&rdquo;, or law&rsquo;s necessary properties? This entry
does not have the space to settle these controversial questions, but
traditional and experimental jurisprudence have contemplated all three
projects (see
 <a href="#GenExpJur">&sect;2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#ParExpJur">&sect;2.2</a>).
 Some philosophers appeal to intuitions to reveal our shared legal
concepts; others to inform the <em>contingent</em> nature of law; and
yet others to clarify law&rsquo;s <em>necessary</em> properties (see
also Tobia 2023: 2508&ndash;2514).</p>

<h3 id="ConExpJur">1.2 Conceptions of Experimental Jurisprudence</h3>

<p>
Experimental jurisprudence often places itself as responsive to the
traditional legal-philosophical backdrop described in
 <a href="#SitExpJurWitJur">&sect;1.1</a>.
 Insofar as legal philosophers assert intuitions that we
&ldquo;all&rdquo; share or recognize (e.g., Raz 1975 [1990: 159]), it
is worthwhile to empirically examine whether those intuitions are
shared (see, e.g., Miotto et al. 2023: 7). And insofar as legal
philosophy seeks to elucidate our concepts, like law (e.g., Flanagan
&amp; Hannikainen 2022), causation (e.g., Knobe &amp; Shapiro 2021) or
reasonableness (e.g., Tobia 2018), data about lay and legal
participants&rsquo; understanding of these notions can inform these
philosophical analyses. On this conception of experimental
jurisprudence, new empirical studies have not fundamentally shifted
traditional philosophical inquiry. Legal philosophy already has a
tradition of appealing to shared understandings and ordinary concepts,
and the new empirical methods simply help to evaluate these
longstanding claims and questions. On this view, X-Jur&rsquo;s novelty
is methodological, not substantive: It does not steer legal philosophy
toward entirely new questions; rather, it addresses existing legal
philosophical questions in a new way.</p>

<p>
There is some disagreement, however, about what exactly is
&ldquo;new&rdquo; about experimental jurisprudence. Even in the early
twentieth century some philosophers adopted an empirical approach to
legal philosophy (e.g., Sharp &amp; Otto 1910; see also T. Murphy 2014
surveying the Norwegian empirical semantics movement from the
1940s&ndash;1950s, which included research related to legal
philosophical questions), the legal realists emphasized the value of
empirical legal study, and a rich tradition of empirical work from the
mid to late twentieth century related to philosophy of criminal law
(e.g., Robinson &amp; Darley 1995), ordinary notions of law (e.g.,
Finkel 1995), and legally relevant concepts like causation (see, e.g.,
Alicke 1992; Spellman 1997) or the impact of outcome severity on moral
and legal responsibility (e.g., Walster 1966; see generally Robbennolt
2000).</p>

<p>
Yet, X-Jurists often propose that <em>something</em> new is happening.
There are some important new features that render experimental
jurisprudence distinctive, even while it has various historical
predecessors and influences, including naturalism in legal philosophy,
law and psychology (see generally Spellman et al. 2025), legal realism
(see generally Mikhail 2025), and (behavioral) law and economics.
Arguably, the breadth of research questions has increased. There is
novel empirical research into questions of general jurisprudence (see
 <a href="#GenExpJur">&sect;2.1</a>)
 and many new questions of particular jurisprudence, including areas
like contract and statutory interpretation, and concepts like consent
and reasonableness (see
 <a href="#ParExpJur">&sect;2.2</a>).
 Moreover, the X-Jurist methodological toolkit is expanding (see
 <a href="#EmpMet">&sect;2.3</a>);
 for example, scholars today increasingly look to methods from natural
language processing (e.g., Baumgartner &amp; Kneer 2025) and undertake
comparative, multi-linguistic, multi-cultural studies (e.g.,
Hannikainen et al. 2021, 2022).</p>

<p>
Least controversially, the term &ldquo;experimental
jurisprudence&rdquo; is also not new. It referred to a substantially
different theory in the earlier twentieth century (Beutel 1934; 1971).
In 2014 the term appeared with its current meaning (Solum 2014), as a
description of scholarship that uses empirical methods to make
progress on legal-philosophical debates. The name under its current
meaning suggests an analogy with
 <a href="../experimental-philosophy/">experimental philosophy</a>,
 which uses empirical methods to inform philosophical debates from
ethics to metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Beyond differing conceptions of experimental jurisprudence&rsquo;s
novelty, there are also differing conceptions of its methodological
and substantive aims. X-Jur often examines the views of laypeople,
those without legal training or expertise, and critiques caution that
this data should not &ldquo;replace&rdquo; insights from legal
practice (Jim&eacute;nez 2021), that it should only
&ldquo;supplement&rdquo; traditional philosophical method (Himma 2023:
348), and that simply lifting lay views &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; is a
bad idea (Dickson 2022: 113) (see
 <a href="#CriExpJur">&sect;3</a>
 for a comprehensive overview). These critiques assume an ambitious
conception of experimental jurisprudence, on which its methodological
goal is to displace aspects of traditional methodology and its
normative vision is for law to reflect ordinary people&rsquo;s
understanding of law.</p>

<p>
However, many X-Jurists endorse a less ambitious conception of the
project. Concerning the methodological claim, experimental
jurisprudence has often framed itself as a useful supplement, not
replacement, of traditional philosophical methodology (e.g., Sommers
2020: 2302; Tobia 2023: 2486; Flanagan 2024: 327). For instance,
X-Jurists claim that relying on the intuitions of a larger sample of
intuiters is a more rigorous version of the already well-established
practice of relying on the authors&rsquo; own intuitions (see Macleod
2019; Tobia 2023) insofar as doing so provides a more representative
portrayal of the pretheoretical commitments people intuitively share.
But no X-Jurist denies that there is much to be done with traditional
philosophical methods, e.g., by accommodating or debunking ordinary
intuitions, after the data is collected.</p>

<p>
While some X-Jur research frames itself as contributing positively to
the analysis of legal concepts (see generally, Stich &amp; Tobia 2016,
for an overview of the similar &ldquo;positive program&rdquo; in
experimental philosophy), other X-Jur research is primarily concerned
with examining cognitive mechanisms and processes underpinning
people&rsquo;s intuitions related to law (e.g., Struchiner, Almeida,
&amp; Hannikainen 2020; Bystranowski, Janik, et al. 2022; Flanagan,
Almeida, et al. 2023, similarly to a large part of experimental
philosophy research; see Knobe 2016 for an overview). These
&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; projects highlight a different potential
contribution from X-Jur to legal philosophy, even if legal philosophy
is less interested in explaining the ordinary concept of law (and
related concepts) than in developing a theoretical concept that can
account for a variety of legal phenomena (e.g., Finnis 2011: 277; Atiq
2025; Marmor 2013). Cognitively oriented X-Jur may supplement, for
instance, those traditional philosophical projects that aim to explain
the legal phenomena in terms of more basic phenomena such as
people&rsquo;s beliefs, attitudes and behaviors (e.g., Marmor 2013;
Hart 1961).</p>

<p>
In sum, just as different legal philosophers have different goals, so
is the case with X-Jurists. Scholars working within X-Jur have taken
empirical data to contribute to traditional conceptual analysis, to
provide negative or critical challenges to traditional methods and
claims, and to offer insight into the cognitive mechanisms underlying
people&rsquo;s legal intuitions.</p>

<p>
There are many other relevant dimensions to &ldquo;conceptualizations
of X-Jur&rdquo;, but one final dimension of importance is
X-Jur&rsquo;s orientation towards laypeople&rsquo;s views of the law.
Many (although not all) X-Jur studies examine laypeople&rsquo;s
beliefs, language, or judgment. At first, it might seem that
X-Jur&rsquo;s study of lay views is premised on an assumption that law
should reflect those views. However, this strong substantive claim,
that the law should generally reflect lay views of the law, is largely
unpopular within experimental jurisprudence. Some have defended this
claim in a limited context; for example, the criminal law should
reflect lay views of the law, to promote compliance or democracy
(e.g., Robinson &amp; Darley 1995; Robinson 2000; Kleinfeld 2017). But
much of experimental jurisprudence scholarship treats correspondence
between ordinary and legal concepts as, at most, offering (defeasible)
reasons for law to use the ordinary concepts. Many scholars ultimately
conclude that the lay view should be rejected. For instance, Sommers
(2020) argues that the law should not simply adopt the lay concept of
consent (see
 <a href="#ConLaw">&sect;2.2.4</a>),
 and Kneer and Bourgeois-Gironde (2017) argue that the lay notion of
intent reflects bias, one that the law should seek to eliminate (see
 <a href="#CriLaw">&sect;2.2.1</a>).
 Other X-Jur works emphasize that X-Jur&rsquo;s empirical contribution
does not directly answer this normative question (should law reflect
the ordinary concepts). Instead, X-Jur helps unearth facts that
contribute to legal-philosophical debate. Because many of law&rsquo;s
central concepts share a name with and plausibly relate to ordinary
counterparts (e.g., cause, consent, duty, intent, reasonable),
empirical study of ordinary concepts can helpfully disentangle the
ordinary from the legal (see, e.g., Tobia 2022).</p>

<h2 id="ResExpJur">2. Research in Experimental Jurisprudence</h2>

<h3 id="GenExpJur">2.1 &ldquo;General&rdquo; Experimental Jurisprudence</h3>

<p>
General jurisprudence is the part of legal philosophy that deals with
universal questions about law. Work in general jurisprudence usually
tries to identify the necessary (e.g., Raz 2009: 24) or central (e.g.,
Schauer 2015) features of law (for a slightly broader definition, see
Donelson 2023; see also Plunkett &amp; Shapiro 2017). Traditionally,
the field has studied topics like the connections between law and
morality (Bix 2000), the normativity of law (Plunkett, Shapiro, &amp;
Toh 2019), the structure of legal systems (Raz 1970 [1980]), the
defining characteristics of legal reasoning (Alexander &amp; Sherwin
2008), among others.</p>

<p>
Research in general experimental jurisprudence has touched on many of
these areas, including the relationship between law and morality
(e.g., Huang 2019) and analogical reasoning in law (e.g., Braman &amp;
Nelson 2007). One general motivation for this research is to examine
whether people&rsquo;s intuitions support particular theories or
conceptual analyses of law and related concepts (see also Prochownik
2021). In this section we detail three examples: X-Jur of the concept
of rule, coercion, and legal validity.</p>

<h4 id="ConRul">2.1.1 The Concept of Rule</h4>

<p>
One of the many tasks of general jurisprudence as defined above is to
characterize legal reasoning (see, e.g., Schauer 2009). In particular,
the field has dedicated much attention to legal interpretation and the
role played by the concept of rule within it. The most famous thought
experiment imagines a hypothetical statute whose text prohibits
&ldquo;vehicles&rdquo; from entering the park (see Hart 1958; Fuller
1958; see generally Schauer 2008). The rule&rsquo;s text
straightforwardly prohibits cars, buses, and tanks from the park. But
suppose the rule&rsquo;s underlying purpose is to keep the parkgoers
safe. If someone were injured in the park, allowing an ambulance into
the park for rescue would plausibly further the rule&rsquo;s
underlying purpose. Does the rule prohibit an ambulance from entering
the park? The text would suggest yes, but the underlying purpose no.
Whether the folk concept of rule is driven by text, purpose, or both
has philosophical implications for both conceptual (e.g., the way
legal reasoning differs or doesn&rsquo;t differ from moral reasoning)
and normative (e.g., should we engage in conceptual engineering with
regards to the folk concept of rule?) questions (see Almeida,
Struchiner, &amp; Hannikainen 2023b for discussion).</p>

<p>
X-jurists have studied the influence of text and purpose on ordinary
judgments of rule violation, finding that both factors matter (Garcia,
Chen &amp; Gordon 2014; Struchiner, Hannikainen, &amp; Almeida 2020).
For example, Struchiner, Hannikainen, and Almeida (2020) presented lay
participants with different types of cases, following Schauer
(1991):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="case_core">core cases (the act is prohibited by both the
rule&rsquo;s text and purpose, e.g., a person enters the park driving
a car at full speed);</li>

<li id="case_oi">overinclusive cases (the act is prohibited by only
the rule&rsquo;s text, e.g., someone mounts a working truck on a
pedestal as a monument inside the park, see Fuller 1958);</li>

<li id="case_ui">underinclusive cases (the act is prohibited by only
the rule&rsquo;s purpose, e.g., a person walks inside the park
swinging a chainsaw in all directions); and</li>

<li id="case_ot">off-topic cases (the act is prohibited by neither the
rule&rsquo;s text nor purpose, e.g., someone walks calmly into the
park).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Participants were asked whether the agent in each of these four types
of cases violated the rule. They evaluated core cases (i) as most
often rule-violating, followed by overinclusive cases (ii), and then
underinclusive cases (iii). In contrast, off-topic cases (iv) were
largely understood as not rule-violating. That a substantial
proportion of participants treat overinclusive and underinclusive
cases as rule-violating suggests that both text and purpose influence
ordinary rule-violation judgments. Moreover, that effect is detectable
using multiple methods (Tanswell et al. forthcoming; Engelmann et al.
2024) and is present among children (Bregant, Wellbery, &amp; Shaw
2019) and across multiple languages and cultures (Hannikainen et al.
2022).</p>

<p>
Subsequent work has uncovered many more features associated with
rule-based decision-making. Overall, text exerts a larger influence
over rule violation judgments than purpose, a tendency that is more
pronounced among lawyers and which can be induced by monetarily
incentivizing coordination among laypeople (Hannikainen et al. 2022;
Bystranowski, Hannikainen, &amp; Tobia 2025). Research has also shown
that morally good purposes influence rule violation judgments to a
much larger extent than morally bad purposes, and that their influence
increases under time pressure and with regard to highly foreseeable
purposes (Flanagan, Almeida, et al. 2023; see Almeida et al. 2025).
Other research has emphasized people&rsquo;s sensitivity to context in
their evaluation of the linguistic meaning (&ldquo;text&rdquo;) of
rules like &ldquo;no vehicles may enter the park&rdquo; (e.g., Tobia
2020; Waldon, Condoravdi, et al. forthcominga).</p>

<p>
Beyond text and purpose, other studies indicate that the rate of
enforcement (Wylie &amp; Gantmann 2023), communal evaluation (Levine
et al. 2024), and the abstractness or concreteness in which legal
cases are described (Struchiner, Almeida &amp; Hannikainen 2020;
Bystranowski, Janik, et al. 2022) influence rule violation judgments.
Overall, these results have led to a substantially more fine-grained
understanding of rule-based decision-making in law. But this is
obviously not the end of philosophical investigations. Should lawyers
prioritize text in interpreting rules? Should abstractness influence
legal determinations? These are questions that require normative
argument along traditional philosophical lines. Similarly,
extrapolating from empirical observations to broader theoretical
claims about, for instance, the relationship between law and morality
also necessitates traditional philosophical argument.</p>

<p>
Characterizing what is distinctive about legal reasoning is a task
that straightforwardly invites empirical examination. One could argue
that this is not the most typical situation in general jurisprudence.
Some of the field&rsquo;s central questions are formulated in terms
that invite metaphysical and conceptual interpretations. How does
experimental jurisprudence tackle these questions?</p>

<h4 id="Coe">2.1.2 Coercion</h4>

<p>
As a second illustration of experimental contributions to general
jurisprudence, consider the relationship between law and coercion (see
Miotto 2021a). Some philosophers have argued that the presence of
coercive mechanisms is a necessary feature of law (e.g., Kelsen 1941;
Bentham [LG]), while others have argued that it is not. For example,
an influential reading of Austin&rsquo;s (1832) command theory of law
depicts law as a series of commands of a sovereign backed by threats
of sanctions. Starting with Hart (1961), mainstream anglophone legal
philosophy has shifted away from the view that coercion is a necessary
feature of law. Instrumental to this shift was the use of roughly the
following thought experiment: imagine a society of angels with several
public rules and institutions to ensure coordination, but without
sanctions, which are unnecessary, as angels have perfect
&ldquo;respect towards their legal institutions&rdquo; and lack
&ldquo;all desire to disobey their rulings&rdquo; (Raz 1975 [1990:
159]. See also: Miotto 2021b). According to Raz, such a system
&ldquo;would be recognized as one [a legal system] by all despite its
lack of sanctions&rdquo; (1975 [1990: 159]). Thus, he concludes,
coercion is not a necessary feature of the concept of a legal system.
With this, Raz doesn&rsquo;t deny that extant legal systems are
coercive. In fact, he claims that law&rsquo;s coerciveness &ldquo;can
be said to be true not only of all known legal systems but of all
which are possible in human society, given that human nature is what
it is&rdquo; (1975 [1990: 160]). Nonetheless, we can conceive of
non-human societies that have non-coercive legal systems.</p>

<p>
Most, but not all (see Marmor 2001: 44; Priel 2011: 23; Himma 2020),
legal philosophers working in this area seem to agree with Raz&rsquo;s
conclusion (Miotto 2021b), even if they might still insist that
coercion&rsquo;s centrality justifies its inclusion within the purview
of general jurisprudence (Schauer 2015).</p>

<p>
How could experimental data on folk intuitions help advance this
debate? Answering this question depends in part on how one construes
the object of philosophical investigation. As discussed in
 <a href="#SitExpJurWitJur">&sect;1.1</a>,
 some legal philosophers view their task as identifying features of
law that would hold across all metaphysically possible worlds in which
law exists. For them, experimental data about actual intuitions can
therefore play only a limited role. However, we have also seen that
most legal philosophers are interested in our actual conceptual
representation of law and would thus see experimental data as useful
in adjudicating jurisprudential debates. After all, if almost no one
represents coercion as a necessary feature of law, it would be hard to
claim that our shared concept of law requires that law be coercive.
Conversely, if almost everyone evaluated coercion as necessary for a
system to count as legal, this would support that there is a
conceptual connection between the two. It is thus no coincidence that
philosophers often appeal to shared intuitions, claiming, for
instance, that the society of angels would be recognized &ldquo;<em>by
all</em>&rdquo; as a legal system (Raz 1975, but see Nye 2017), or
that most people wouldn&rsquo;t recognize it as such (Himma 2020).
Whether these appeals are universal or restricted to specific groups
(e.g., legal philosophers or legal practitioners) is controversial
(see
 <a href="#IntExpNotOrdPeoMatForJur">&sect;3.2.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Turning the society of angels thought experiment into an
<em>actual</em> empirical study might help adjudicate who is right.
Miotto, Almeida, and Struchiner (2023: 105) conducted a study assuming
a universal appeal and found that most laypeople (59%) share the
Razian intuition (35% rejected it). In fact, they found that when the
thought experiment is formulated at a higher degree of specificity,
people tend to accept even the possibility of a non-coercive
<em>human</em> legal system (2023: 121).</p>

<p>
These results vindicate a pre-existing jurisprudential claim about the
relationship between law and coercion: hypothetical non-coercive legal
systems are conceptually possible. In other ways, however, the results
also challenge philosophical orthodoxy. After all, Raz claimed that
human legal systems were necessarily coercive. And yet, participants
were willing to say that a hypothetical human society without coercion
still had a legal system.</p>

<p>
This shows that general experimental jurisprudence might not only help
gather evidence for or against current philosophical theories (for
another example, see Roversi et al. 2023) but also help bring into
view new possibilities. Perhaps the clearest instance where this has
occurred so far concerns the issue of legal validity.</p>

<h4 id="LegVal">2.1.3 Legal Validity</h4>

<p>
As a final example of general X-Jur, consider legal validity. Donelson
and Hannikainen (2020) set out to investigate whether Fuller&rsquo;s
&ldquo;internal morality of law&rdquo;&mdash;a set of eight principles
that Fuller thought must be at least partially met by all legal
systems&mdash;receives widespread endorsement. In doing so, they
uncovered an apparent contradiction: participants assigned to one
condition tended to agree that compliance with Fullerian principles
was <em>necessary</em> for something to count as a law, while
participants in another condition tended to say that actual laws
flaunted said principles. For instance, more participants agreed that
the law as enforced in a hypothetical society called the Faraway
nations &ldquo;could not differ much from the law as formally
announced&rdquo;, than with the empirical statement that law as
enforced &ldquo;does not differ much from the law as formally
announced&rdquo;. This sounds contradictory because whatever is
necessarily the case must also actually be the case. Thus, if the
enforcement of all possible laws must necessarily match up with their
formal announcement, it would follow that the enforcement of any
particular law would adhere to the way it was formally announced. One
simple explanation for this effect would be that participants
interpreted &ldquo;could&rdquo; in a normative sense. However, the
effect held even for participants who described their interpretation
of the necessity statements in an alethic, instead of a normative,
sense (Hannikainen et al. 2021). The same puzzling pattern was
obtained among lawyers (Donelson &amp; Hannikainen 2020: Study 2) and
across 11 different countries (Hannikainen et al. 2021).</p>

<p>
Himma (2023) takes this body of evidence as a challenge to the
usefulness of X-Jur, claiming that &ldquo;if we assume that our
conceptual practices are coherent, it is difficult to see what these
results could tell us about them&rdquo; (2023: 365). While
acknowledging the difficulty, recent work by X-Jurists has attempted
to demonstrate that the contradictory nature of the results only
arises under certain assumptions about the conceptual structure of the
concept of law (see
 <a href="#CriExpJur">&sect;3</a>
 for a more detailed discussion of Himma 2023).</p>

<p>
To see the way conceptual structures might come into play in
interpreting the empirical results, it is useful to consider a
so-called
 <a href="../thick-ethical-concepts/">thick ethical concept</a>
 from outside the legal domain such as &ldquo;courage&rdquo;. We see
someone as courageous when they engage in a risky action that is
simultaneously normatively valuable. At least according to some views
on thick concepts, this means that both risk and normative value are
necessary conditions for courage. Accordingly, it would be
contradictory to say that someone acted courageously when they
didn&rsquo;t do anything valuable (see Willemsen &amp; Reuter 2021 for
evidence in that direction).</p>

<p>
If the concept of law were a thick concept (see Enoch &amp; Toh 2013
for discussion of this possibility), participants in Donelson and
Hannikainen&rsquo;s (2020) study would indeed have contradicted
themselves. For instance: suppose that legislative enactment and
compliance with the internal morality of law play the same roles in
the concept of legal validity that risk and normative value play in
the concept of courage. It would follow that a statute could only
count as a law when it was enacted by a legislature and complied with
the internal morality of law. Hence, it couldn&rsquo;t be
simultaneously the case that (a) compliance with the internal morality
of law is a necessary feature of legal validity and (b) there are laws
which don&rsquo;t comply with the internal morality of law.</p>

<p>
Donelson (2023), however, suggests that law might not be a thick
concept, but a dual character concept instead. Dual character concepts
are associated with two distinct application criteria, one descriptive
and the other normative. The canonical example is that of a scientist.
Someone is a scientist in a descriptive sense if they engage in
certain concrete activities such as performing experiments and writing
scientific papers. But when someone who engages in the aforementioned
activities doesn&rsquo;t have a sincere commitment to empirical
knowledge, most participants are tempted to say of them that
&ldquo;there is a sense in which they are a scientist, but if you
think about what it truly means to be a scientist, you would have to
say they are not truly a scientist&rdquo; (Knobe, Prasada, &amp;
Newman 2013). If the concept of law has the same structure, there
would be a descriptive criterion determining one sense in which
something can count as a law and a normative criterion determining a
different sense. Under this way of setting things up, there would be
no contradiction: &ldquo;The folk [&hellip;] holds that [actual] laws
need not obey Fullerian principles, but <em>true</em> laws must
[&hellip;]&rdquo; (Donelson 2023: 34).</p>

<p>
The same idea has been independently considered as one way of
answering the central jurisprudential question of whether unjust
statutes count as laws. In a pioneering paper, Flanagan and
Hannikainen (2022) have shown that a plurality of participants
conceptualize unjust statutes as law in one sense, but not true laws.
Further research has expanded on those initial results, extending them
to cases of unjust conduct that are not forbidden by statute (Flanagan
&amp; Almeida 2024) and for rule violation judgments (Almeida,
Struchiner &amp; Hannikainen 2023a).</p>

<p>
While legal philosophers have long claimed that law has a &ldquo;dual
nature&rdquo; (Alexy 2010) or a &ldquo;dual character&rdquo; (Finnis
2007 [2024]), it has been argued that the dual character structure
posed by experimental philosophers is substantially different from
these previous treatments, despite the shared terminology (Almeida
2024). Another strand of legal theory might claim that these studies
simply pick out an ambiguity in the word &ldquo;law&rdquo;, which
might refer to two entirely different concepts (e.g., L. Murphy 2005;
Shapiro 2011; Hart 1961; see Almeida 2024 for a response). It&rsquo;s
also worth noting that some are skeptical about whether dual character
concepts provide a useful philosophical framework, claiming that
existing theoretical tools better explain the linguistic patterns
under discussion (Phillips &amp; Plunkett 2023; Atiq 2025).</p>

<p>
Overall, general experimental jurisprudence is still in its infancy,
even when compared to particular experimental jurisprudence (see
 <a href="#ParExpJur">&sect;2.2</a>).
 So far, only a small number of general jurisprudence questions have
been addressed by experimental methods, and important criticisms
raised about those few questions that have been addressed are still
being debated.</p>

<h3 id="ParExpJur">2.2 &ldquo;Particular&rdquo; Experimental Jurisprudence</h3>

<p>
Particular jurisprudence studies legal-philosophical questions about
specific areas of law. The same enterprise is also sometimes called
&ldquo;special&rdquo; or &ldquo;specific&rdquo; jurisprudence (see
Khaitan &amp; Steele 2023). We employ &ldquo;particular
jurisprudence&rdquo; throughout the entry. Particular jurisprudence is
preoccupied with questions like: What justifies criminal punishment
(e.g., Hart 1959); what is the relationship between our ordinary
notion of causation and causation in the law (e.g., Hart &amp;
Honor&eacute; 1959); what should the tort law standard of reasonable
care require (e.g., Keating 1996); what is the nature of property
ownership (see, e.g., entry on
 <a href="../property/">property and ownership</a>);
 what is the relationship between ordinary promise-making and legal
contracting (e.g., Shiffrin 2007); and should judges interpret a legal
rule via its text or purpose (Hart 1958; Fuller 1958)? Unlike the
broad debates in general jurisprudence, debates about these particular
questions are typically steeped in details and context of particular
areas of law and particular jurisdictions.</p>

<p>
Particular experimental jurisprudence has contributed data and
analysis to each of the questions in the previous paragraph. In fact,
researchers have produced an enormous amount of experimental work of
philosophical value about many particular legal concepts. Given the
spatial and thematic limitations of this entry, we can only skim the
surface of the literature. This section reviews some representative
examples of particular X-Jur across five areas: criminal law, tort
law, property law, contract law, and legal interpretation. In
selecting the examples, we sought to emphasize two recurring
objectives of research in particular X-Jur: (1) to clarify the extent
of correspondence (e.g., Knobe &amp; Shapiro 2021;
 <a href="#TorLaw">&sect;2.2.2</a>)
 or divergence (e.g., Sommers 2020;
 <a href="#ConLaw">&sect;2.2.4</a>)
 between folk concepts and their legal counterparts, and (2) to
establish whether the application of legal concepts is driven by
reliable or unreliable (e.g., Kneer &amp; Skocze&#324; 2023;
 <a href="#CriLaw">&sect;2.2.1</a>)
 cognitive processes.</p>

<h4 id="CriLaw">2.2.1 Criminal Law</h4>

<p>
Criminal law is a branch of law with salient connections to
laypeople&rsquo;s sense of justice and morality. Many of the behaviors
considered by society as wrong are also penalized by criminal law, and
some of the relevant objectives of criminal law are to protect
socially valuable goods and restore justice when wrongs against such
goods are committed (e.g., Darley 2009; Robinson &amp; Darley 1995).
Moreover, criminal acts are usually sanctioned with especially
coercive means, which raises the important philosophical question of
the justification of criminal punishment, which divides retributivists
(e.g., Moore 1997) and utilitarians (e.g., Bentham [PML]; see
 <a href="#Pun">&sect;2.2.1.2 &ldquo;Punishment&rdquo;</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
In this light, it is unsurprising that criminal lawyers often
formulate or interpret legal norms to serve a common sense of justice
(e.g., Robinson &amp; Darley 1995: xv, 1). Many studies in the
particular X-Jur of criminal law thus examine the content of folk
concepts relevant to criminal law and the extent to which they overlap
with their legal counterparts (see, especially, Robinson &amp; Darley
1995). To the extent that legal theorists and practitioners refer to
ordinary intuitions when drafting, interpreting, or applying criminal
law, they may find such research valuable. However, whether more
general implications can be drawn for criminal law theory and practice
from such research is a matter of discussion. According to one
position in this debate, &ldquo;the criminal codes of societies should
be broadly in accordance with the moral intuitions of the governed
community&rdquo; (Darley 2009: 15). One reason for this is that
discrepancies between criminal codes and community views undermine the
law&rsquo;s moral credibility (e.g., Robinson &amp; Darley 1995;
Carlsmith &amp; Darley 2008; Darley 2009); which may weaken
people&rsquo;s willingness to obey it (e.g., Robinson &amp; Darley
1995: 201&ndash;202). In contrast, others scrutinized the
psychological processes involved in people&rsquo;s applications of
concepts relevant to criminal justice, finding that lay judgments are
often affected by irrelevant factors or are otherwise subject to
systematic biases. This has led some to argue that legislators ought
to minimize the impact of laypeople&rsquo;s moral intuitions on
criminal law (e.g., Nadelhoffer 2006; Malle &amp; Nelson 2003). Below,
we review examples of research that exemplify these two projects in
X-Jur of criminal law.</p>

<h5 id="ActReuMenReaDis">2.2.1.1 The <em lang="la">Actus Reus</em> and <em lang="la">Mens Rea</em> Distinction</h5>

<p>
In common law, the two constitutive elements of a criminal offense are
<em lang="la">actus reus</em> (the action or conduct, the
&ldquo;external side of the criminal conduct&rdquo;) and <em lang="la">mens
rea</em> (the mental state of the actor, the criminal
conduct&rsquo;s &ldquo;internal side&rdquo;) (Fletcher 2007: 43).
These elements constitute Coke&rsquo;s well-known (1644: 6 [ch. 1])
principle: criminal conduct combines a guilty act with a guilty mind
(<em lang="la">actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea</em>). Similar
requirements for committing a crime are also present in continental
legal systems.</p>

<p>
Some work in X-Jur, however, has challenged that <em lang="la">mens
rea</em> evaluation might be completely decoupled from analyzing the
external outcomes caused by one&rsquo;s conduct. Supporting this
challenge, Kneer and Bourgeois-Gironde (2017) have found that
intentionality ascription among professional judges is sensitive to
the valence and the severity of the outcome caused by the
protagonist&rsquo;s action in ways that closely mimic lay intuitions
(e.g., Knobe 2003; for a meta-analysis of outcome effects on
responsibility judgments, see Robbennolt 2000). In one study, legal
experts read a story about a mayor who decided to build a highway
connection despite adverse consequences on the environment. In one
condition, the consequences were severe (animals in the construction
zone died), in another one, they were mild (animals were temporarily
disturbed). Professional judges perceived the major&rsquo;s action as
significantly more intentional when its outcome was severe. The
authors of the study go on to argue that this mismatch between
laypeople&rsquo;s and professionals&rsquo; intentionality ascriptions
on one hand and the legal requirements of <em lang="la">mens rea</em>
on the other constitutes a bias in need of addressing (but see
Prochownik et al.&nbsp;2025; Tobia 2024).</p>

<p>
Other work, however, shows that people are capable of distinguishing
between the two constructs. These studies reveal that <em lang="la">actus
reus</em> and <em lang="la">mens rea</em> have
dissociable cognitive and neural bases and that they independently
affect moral and legal judgments. For instance, Young, Cushman, et al.
(2007) presented subjects with vignettes that varied in terms of
protagonists&rsquo; beliefs (negative vs. neutral) and caused outcomes
(negative vs. neutral). For example, in the &ldquo;negative belief and
negative outcome&rdquo; condition, the protagonist knowingly puts a
toxin into her friend&rsquo;s coffee, and the friend dies; in the
&ldquo;neutral belief and negative outcome condition&rdquo;, she
falsely believes that she puts sugar into her friend&rsquo;s coffee
which turns out to be a toxin, and the friend dies. Afterward,
participants judged whether what the actor did was morally permissible
while their brain activity was monitored.</p>

<p>
The study found that a brain region associated with belief attribution
(e.g., Saxe &amp; Powell 2006; Saxe &amp; Wexler 2005) was involved in
participants&rsquo; moral judgments across all four experimental
conditions. However, they also found significant differences regarding
the role of belief attribution in forming moral judgment across
conditions. For instance, cases of failed attempts were determined
solely by belief attribution. Cases of successful crimes relied on
belief attribution to a lesser extent, plausibly because of the
greater role of causal information in forming moral judgments (Young
et al. 2007: 8238&ndash;8239). Finally, cases of &ldquo;unknowing
harms&rdquo; (involving neutral beliefs and negative outcomes) were
determined by causal and belief attribution, but also involved
activating brain areas associated with conflict. These findings
suggest how information about the actor&rsquo;s belief (relevant for
<em lang="la">mens rea</em> in the law) and the outcome they cause
(relevant for <em lang="la">actus reus</em> in the law) is encoded in
the brain and integrated into moral and legal judgment (Young et al.
2007: 8235).</p>

<p>
Cushman&rsquo;s (2008) research further supports the idea that
intentional and causal analyses sometimes compete to determine moral
and legal judgments. In one of his studies, participants were
presented with the following scenario: Brown and Smith are two runners
competing for a championship. During the banquet before the race,
Brown sprinkles some poppy seeds on Smith&rsquo;s food, believing that
Smith is allergic to them. Now, some participants read that
Brown&rsquo;s belief was false and Smith was unharmed (&ldquo;no
harm&rdquo; condition). Others read that although Brown&rsquo;s belief
was false, Smith died due to causes independent of Brown&rsquo;s
action (&ldquo;harm&rdquo; condition). Arguably, in both cases Brown
committed the same crime (a failed attempt to kill Smith) and,
therefore, deserves the same amount of punishment. However,
participants in Cushman&rsquo;s study assigned significantly more
punishment to the agent in the &ldquo;no harm&rdquo; condition than in
the &ldquo;harm&rdquo; condition. One possible explanation for these
surprising results is that, on the one hand, in the &ldquo;no
harm&rdquo; case, the judgment of punishment relied straightforwardly
on belief attribution. On the other hand, in the &ldquo;harm&rdquo;
condition, the independent causal chain led away from the perpetrator
and could have &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; people&rsquo;s assessment of his
mental state (Cushman 2008: 371).</p>

<p>
Together, these studies suggest that human moral psychology reflects
the operation of Coke&rsquo;s principle, requiring the combination of
<em lang="la">mens rea</em> and <em lang="la">actus reus</em> for
committing a crime. However, they also indicate that information about
mental states and caused outcomes contribute differently to a range of
moral and legal judgments (e.g., crimes of attempts are evaluated
based on belief attribution, successful crimes based on belief and
causal attributions), which raises a possibility of discrepancies
between the criminal code and lay intuitions.</p>

<p>
Distinct criminal law systems conceptualize culpable mental states
differently. The Model Penal Code (MPC, see
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>),
 on which many state criminal codes in the US are modeled,
distinguishes four categories of <em lang="la">mens rea</em>: purpose,
knowledge, recklessness, and negligence. For instance, a criminal
result is caused purposely if it was a &ldquo;conscious object&rdquo;
of the perpetrator, knowingly if the perpetrator was
&ldquo;practically certain&rdquo; that it would occur, and recklessly
if the perpetrator acted despite the &ldquo;substantial and
unjustifiable risk&rdquo; of causing it (MPC, Section 2.02). Finally,
the outcome is brought about negligently if the perpetrator was
unaware of the risk, although they should have been.</p>

<p>
The assessment of the <em lang="la">mens rea</em> element of crime in
the US is a task performed by a non-specialist jury, but are laypeople
able to assess the defendant&rsquo;s mental state in accordance with
the MPC guidelines? This is an empirical question examined in some
recent X-Jur research. Shen et al. (2011) presented a sample of
jury-eligible Americans with various scenarios that differed in the
perpetrators&rsquo; mental states (four <em lang="la">mens rea</em>
categories distinguished by MPC mentioned above and blamelessness).
Additionally, the researchers manipulated the severity of harm, a
factor known to affect mental state attribution (Shen et al. 2011:
1326; see Knobe 2006; Machery 2008). After reading each scenario,
participants decided how much the perpetrator should be punished. The
results showed that participants exacted varying degrees of punishment
depending on the perpetrator&rsquo;s mental state in accordance with
the MPC, with one exception: They did not differentiate punishment for
criminal outcomes committed knowingly and recklessly&mdash;even when
participants had access to the MPC&rsquo;s definitions of <em lang="la">mens
rea</em>. In a follow-up study, participants read the
scenarios and classified the protagonist&rsquo;s mental states into
one of the MPC&rsquo;s <em lang="la">mens rea</em> categories. In this
sorting task, participants only did well in identifying purposeful and
blameless crimes, but exhibited difficulties identifying other mental
states. Other research has replicated this pattern, demonstrating that
laypeople struggle to distinguish recklessness and knowledge when
evaluating criminal outcomes (even when trained on a more accessible
version of the MPC guidelines; see Ginther et al. 2014) and to apply
these doctrines appropriately when assessing criminal liability for
crimes involving attendant circumstances (i.e., although MPC requires
knowledge, laypeople reckoned recklessness sufficient for criminal
liability; Jones, Montague, &amp; Yaffe 2020).</p>

<p>
In sum, these findings suggest that laypeople&rsquo;s determinations
of <em lang="la">mens rea</em> fail to capture various subtleties in
the MPC&mdash;especially, between outcomes committed knowingly versus
merely recklessly. Moreover, they consider recklessness a sufficient
condition of criminal liability for crimes requiring knowledge
concerning attendant circumstances. This may have serious implications
for jurors&rsquo; ability to correctly ascribe <em lang="la">mens
rea</em>, especially for crimes (e.g., homicide) where assigning
recklessness or knowledge of the outcome substantially affects their
legal consequences (Shen et al. 2011: 1349). If jurors cannot make
this distinction properly or reliably, this may result in unequal
treatment of perpetrators committing the same crime (e.g., Ginther et
al. 2014: 1329).</p>

<p>
In this light, normative questions arise: Should the distinction
between knowledge and recklessness be abandoned by the MPC? Should
recklessness be a sufficient requirement for criminal liability?
Potential answers to these questions are not straightforward and may
vary. For example, it could be argued that jury instructions should
better explain the distinction between knowledge and recklessness to
jurors or, if such clarification does not suffice, that the
distinction should be abandoned altogether (Shen et al. 2011: 1352,
1354).</p>

<h5 id="Pun">2.2.1.2 Punishment</h5>

<p>
As we have seen, a person who commits a guilty act with a guilty mind
commits a crime and is thus, at least in principle, liable to
punishment. There are different views regarding how to justify
punishment in the philosophy of criminal law (see the entry on
 <a href="../legal-punishment/">legal punishment</a>
 for a review). On the one hand, retributivists (e.g., Moore 1997; J.
Murphy 2007) argue that criminal offenders should be punished because
they deserve it. In other words, the offender&rsquo;s
&ldquo;desert&rdquo; provides a sufficient reason for punishment,
irrespective of its consequences (e.g., Moore 1997). On the other
hand, consequentialists (e.g., Bentham [PML) argue that criminal
punishment is justified by its potential benefits&mdash;i.e., by its
capacity to deter, incapacitate, and/or rehabilitate (past or future)
offenders. According to the deterrence version of this view, criminal
punishment deters future crime either by barring a specific offender
from repeating their crime in the future (specific deterrence) or by
dissuading potential offenders from committing similar crimes in the
future (general deterrence). Incapacitation prevents a specific
offender from undertaking criminal activities (at least) for the time
being while serving their sentence. Finally, rehabilitation aims to
reform criminal offenders (e.g., morally educate them) so they do not
repeat their crimes in the future. These are the most frequent
utilitarian reasons for criminal punishment, but there are many more.
For instance, punishment also serves a communicative function&mdash;it
sends a message that the community disapproves of certain activities,
and by doing so, it, among others, reinforces social norms prohibiting
such behaviors in society and morally educates criminal wrongdoers
(e.g., Nadelhoffer et al. 2013: 237, 240&ndash;241). A recent survey
of law professors found endorsement of many of these as a
justification of criminal punishment, including rehabilitation (92%),
deterrence (82%), incapacitation (65%), retribution (40%); and
expressivism (35%); 3% of participants reported that there should be
no criminal punishment (Mart&iacute;nez &amp; Tobia 2023)</p>

<p>
While philosophers and legal scholars have debated these different
reasons for punishing criminals armed with arguments, abundant
experimental work in social psychology and experimental economics has
focused on examining laypeople&rsquo;s punitive behavior and their
underlying motives. Many of these studies, using different
experimental techniques and paradigms, have been offered in favor of
the intuitive retributivism hypothesis (see generally, Zisman &amp;
Rehren forthcoming), i.e., that people punish based on &ldquo;just
desert&rdquo; considerations rather than a utilitarian calculus.</p>

<p>
For instance, Darley, Carlsmith, and Robinson (2000) presented
subjects with ten scenarios involving a variety of intentionally
committed harms that differed in the severity of the offense (a
retributivism-relevant factor) and the likelihood of the
offender&rsquo;s recidivism (an incapacitation-relevant factor). The
researchers found that people&rsquo;s decisions about how much to
punish were primarily driven by the offense&rsquo;s seriousness. In
the following part of the study, participants were asked to reassign
punishments for all scenarios, adopting retributivist and
incapacitation perspectives. Punishment assignments from the
retributivist perspective closely mirrored those made beforehand
without any instructions. In contrast, assignments from the
incapacitation perspective relied more on the information about the
likelihood of the perpetrator repeating the crime; however, they also
considered the offense&rsquo;s severity. These results indicate that
people base their punitive decisions on just desert considerations by
default, although they can also consider the incapacitation
perspective when directly prompted to do so (see also Carlsmith,
Darley, &amp; Robinson 2002, for similar findings regarding
retributivism and deterrence). Similarly, Carlsmith (2008) found that
people endorse utilitarian principles when formulated abstractly but
reject them if they violate their sense of justice while deciding
concrete cases (see Carlsmith &amp; Darley 2008: 207&ndash;208 for a
discussion).</p>

<p>
Other studies examined people&rsquo;s punitive behaviors in addition
to punitive judgments. For instance, Carlsmith (2006) investigated the
kind of information people seek while deciding on an appropriate
amount of punishment for the committed crime (the so-called
&ldquo;behavioral process tracing&rdquo; task; Jacoby et al. 1987).
When given a choice, laypeople sought retributivism-related
information before and more frequently than information related to
incapacitation and deterrence, suggesting that they &ldquo;punish
primarily on the basis of retribution&rdquo; (Carlsmith 2006: 437; see
also replications based on a similar research paradigm: Keller et al.
2010; Rehren &amp; Zisman 2022). In another study, based on the
experimental economics paradigm, Nadelhoffer, Heshmati, and colleagues
(2013) found that participants punished third-party players by
deducting their welfare at the cost to themselves regardless of
whether others would be informed about the punitive deduction,
indicating that punishment is driven by retributivist motives and not
by the desire to communicate disapproval.</p>

<p>
However, a recent X-Jur study points towards a different direction.
According to Michael Moore (1997), the deserved suffering of the
criminal wrongdoer provides a sufficient reason for punishment&mdash;a
belief that is supposedly shared by many. Bauer and Poama (2020)
experimentally tested these sufficiency and pervasiveness claims. They
presented participants with a thought experiment based on an actual
criminal case involving rape and robbery (Moore 1997). After reading
about the case, participants imagined that the sexual and violent
impulses of the previous offender were significantly impeded due to an
accident and that he had no further need to commit robbery due to a
large inheritance, eliminating the risk of repeating such crimes in
the future; nonetheless, he was sentenced to ten years in prison by
the court. Participants were then provided with different details
regarding how much the offender suffered in prison and whether he
underwent a moral change, and evaluated the justness of the sentence.
The results showed that both factors mattered for people&rsquo;s
justness evaluations, providing limited support for the sufficiency
claim. Moreover, participants endorsed retributivism explicitly in
only one out of three different measures of the participants&rsquo;
views on the goals of punishment, undermining the pervasiveness
claim.</p>

<p>
Future experimental work should bridge the apparent inconsistencies in
the findings regarding folk retributivism and examine their
theoretical implications.</p>

<h5 id="MorLuc">2.2.1.3 Moral Luck</h5>

<p>
Moral luck is another puzzling phenomenon of philosophical (e.g.,
Williams 1976; Nagel 1979) and legal (e.g., Enoch 2010) relevance
examined by experimental research. Imagine two agents driving home at
night after consuming alcohol. They both get distracted while driving
and, while one of them crashes into a tree, the other fatally runs
over a pedestrian. Although both agents are equally guilty of driving
under the influence and equally had no control over the resulting
outcome, the driver who killed a pedestrian (&ldquo;morally
unlucky&rdquo;) would face more severe punishment than the driver who
hit a tree (e.g., Cushman 2008; Young et al. 2010; Lench et al.
2015).</p>

<p>
Recent findings in X-Jur shed light on the psychological processes
involved in laypeople&rsquo;s judgments in such cases. Kneer and
Machery (2019) investigated the impact of moral luck on a range of
moral judgments (permissibility, wrongness, blame, and punishment). In
their studies, one group of participants saw both vignettes about
lucky and unlucky agents (designed to promote reflective comparison),
while others only one of those stories (to mimic real-life conditions
in which people evaluate cases sequentially). In the former (joint
evaluation) context, moral luck had a limited effect. In the latter
(separate evaluation) context, moral luck intuitions appeared across
various judgments, arising most strongly in the case of punishment
judgments (cf. Cushman 2008). Arguably, such findings explain why
ordinary intuitions and criminal codes are often in agreement; for
instance, &ldquo;why legal systems often impose more severe penalties
for more negative outcomes&rdquo; (Prochownik 2021) and assign greater
punishment for successful crimes than failed attempts (e.g., in the
US, but see Model Penal Code; e.g., Cushman 2011; Enoch 2010).
However, whether the law <em>should</em> depend on luck (Cushman 2011)
is a normative question that cannot be answered by empirical data
alone. It touches on the broader philosophical question of whether we
should hold others responsible for outcomes beyond their control (see
Enoch 2010), with numerous implications for the philosophy of criminal
law.</p>

<h4 id="TorLaw">2.2.2 Tort Law</h4>

<p>
Tort law reflects the civil law governing the consequences that follow
from a person&rsquo;s act that wrongs another person (or their
property). For example, the tort of &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; applies
to a person who breaches a duty to act with reasonable care, when that
breach causes injury to another person. As even this simple example
illustrates, conceptual questions abound in the philosophy of tort.
When exactly does someone act without &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; care,
and in what circumstances is such a breach the &ldquo;cause&rdquo; of
an injury? Traditional legal philosophy has studied these questions,
and in recent years, X-Jur of tort has also contributed to the
examination of concepts like causation and reasonableness.</p>

<p>
First, consider causation. Judgments about causation play a central
role in legal reasoning, e.g., as a prerequisite for liability in
criminal and civil contexts. Moreover, what counts as a cause under
the law is often taken to be the same as our notion of cause in
everyday life, or at least plausibly related to it (Hart &amp;
Honor&eacute; 1959: 1). But causation is notoriously tricky to pin
down. For instance: imagine that John negligently crashes his car into
Paul&rsquo;s fence. Did his negligence cause the damage? One notion of
cause (often referred to as a but-for cause) requires us to imagine
whether the outcome would have obtained in a counterfactual world
where John wasn&rsquo;t negligent. That allows us to see that
John&rsquo;s negligence is a cause of the damage to Paul&rsquo;s
fence: had he driven with appropriate care, the fence would be intact.
But there are many other but-for causes that are necessary for the
damage to have occurred. Had the car dealership not sold a car to
John, the damage wouldn&rsquo;t have occurred; if John&rsquo;s
employer hadn&rsquo;t changed headquarters, his commute wouldn&rsquo;t
have run through Paul&rsquo;s yard, etc. It would be ridiculous to
deem the car dealership or John&rsquo;s employer <em>responsible</em>
for the damage to Paul&rsquo;s fence. So, even though but-for
causation might be a necessary condition for the kind of legal
responsibility under discussion, it&rsquo;s clearly not sufficient.
Thus, an action that passes the but-for test will then be treated as a
<em>cause in fact</em>, though not every <em>cause in fact</em> will
then be treated as a <em>cause in law</em> (or proximate cause).</p>

<p>
In a series of studies, Spellman (1997) explored the role of such
counterfactual reasoning in people&rsquo;s causal attributions. For
instance, one study investigated people&rsquo;s causal attributions in
cases involving conjunctive causes in a temporal chain, i.e., a
sequence of causes that are each individually necessary and jointly
sufficient for the outcome to obtain. Participants considered a
scenario in which two players each tossed a coin for a chance to win
$1000. However, the coins landed differently (one landed heads and the
other landed tails), and as a result, neither player won any money.
Participants&rsquo; causal judgments reflected a sensitivity to the
temporal order: such that when Player 2&rsquo;s coin toss occurred
after Player 1&rsquo;s coin toss, their action was seen as more
causally relevant to their loss&mdash;than when they occurred
simultaneously. Follow-up studies indicated that this effect reflects
a tendency to credit events with causal relevance to the extent that
they change the probability that an outcome occurs. In sum,
Spellman&rsquo;s (1997) studies suggest that people spontaneously
compute the contingency of an outcome on an event and assign causal
relevance to actions with the highest contingency (while also favoring
actions that are temporally closer to their outcomes).</p>

<p>
Early research in social psychology has focused on laypeople&rsquo;s
judgments of causation in the context of unfortunate outcomes, showing
that probability isn&rsquo;t all there is to it. For instance, Alicke
(1992) described a car accident in which a driver, driving over the
speed limit, in combination with an environmental element (e.g., the
presence of an oil spill on the road), caused an accident in which
multiple road users sustained injuries. Additionally, the study
manipulated the driver&rsquo;s motivation for speeding: to hide an
anniversary gift in the morally good condition, versus a vial of
cocaine in the morally bad condition. Although the driver&rsquo;s
actions were the same across conditions, they were seen as playing a
greater causal role when speeding to hide a vial of cocaine than when
doing so to hide an anniversary gift. Follow up studies replicated the
initial effect, showing that in matching pairs of actions, the
blameworthy variant is seen as more causally relevant in explaining
multiple downstream outcomes than the blameless variant&mdash;whether
the action was necessary or sufficient (see also Knobe &amp; Fraser
2008).</p>

<p>
Incorporating both counterfactual reasoning and the effects of norm
violation on ordinary causation judgments, Joshua Knobe and Scott
Shapiro (2021) explored the concept of proximate cause through the
lens of experimental jurisprudence. They highlighted a debate between
formalists, according to which the notion of a proximate cause in law
is purely descriptive, and realists, for whom the notion of a legal
cause relies on normative standards. By reviewing numerous studies in
cognitive science, the authors argued that judgments about causation
depend on a particular kind of moral judgment, specifically, a
judgment about whether the target action is <em>normal</em>&mdash;both
in a descriptive and a normative sense. The authors then advanced an
account of how causal judgments in both conjunctive cases (when causes
1 and 2 are together necessary and sufficient) and disjunctive cases
(when the presence of either cause 1 or 2 is on its own necessary and
sufficient) can be explained by participants&rsquo; representations of
whether the candidate causes are normal or abnormal. In closing, the
authors argued that the theory of proximate cause as causal selection
can predict a wide range of highly visible decisions in US American
case law. (For a critical review, arguing that the ordinary
&ldquo;abnormality test&rdquo; is not the best explanation of legal
causation, see Sebok 2021 in Other Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
As a second example, consider reasonableness, another central legal
concept, sitting at the core of the negligence standard in common law
torts, as well as other standards in and out of tort law (Zipursky
2015). There is rich philosophical debate about the nature of legal
reasonableness, and many highlight the concept&rsquo;s connection to
ordinary reasonableness or ordinary reasoning (e.g., Zipursky 2015;
Gardner 2015; Geistfeld 2020). Is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; action what
most people would do, cost-benefit justified action, ideal or virtuous
action, or something else?</p>

<p>
Experimental jurisprudence has examined the ordinary notion of
reasonableness to inform these philosophical questions. Jaeger (2020;
2025; forthcoming) finds that descriptive norms (e.g., perceived
average behavior) affect laypeople&rsquo;s evaluation of
reasonableness, while cost-benefit norms (what is perceived to be
efficient) do not. Drawing on research on the concept of normality
(Bear &amp; Knobe 2017), Tobia (2018; 2025) finds that lay evaluations
of reasonable quantities (e.g., a reasonable number of hours&rsquo;
notice for a landlord to provide before entering) are better predicted
by a <em>hybrid combination</em> of average and ideal quantities
(e.g., the average number of hours&rsquo; notice; the ideal number of
hours&rsquo; notice) than by either the average or ideal alone.
Baumgartner and Kneer (2025) find that in natural language,
&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is more like thick concepts (like
&ldquo;cruelty&rdquo;) that have descriptive and evaluative aspects,
compared to purely descriptive concepts (like &ldquo;table&rdquo;) or
thin evaluative ones that have only evaluative content (like
&ldquo;good&rdquo;). Beyond these studies about average versus ideal
versus hybrid theory, empirical research reports that lay evaluations
of reasonableness are subject to hindsight bias (LaBine &amp; LaBine
1996; Kneer 2022); when an action leads to a worse outcome (all else
equal) participants are inclined to evaluate the action as less
reasonable.</p>

<h4 id="ProLaw">2.2.3 Property Law</h4>

<p>
Though there is some debate as to whether property is a philosophical
issue (see the section on this topic in the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/property/#PropPhilIssu">property and ownership</a>),
 some philosophers have explored philosophical issues in property law
(e.g., Locke 1689; Snare 1972). In the domain of experimental
jurisprudence, researchers have interrogated the folk concept of
ownership as a window into what it means for something to be
one&rsquo;s property. Does the evidence indicate a universal ordinary
concept of ownership? If so, what philosophical significance does this
have? How does it bear on the common assumption that property law is
fundamentally technical and even stripped of philosophical depth?</p>

<p>
Evidence suggests that a concept of ownership emerges at a young age:
children as young as two understand that an object&rsquo;s owner need
not be currently using the object; and at three they prefer their own
toys to identical duplicates owned by others (see generally
Nancekivell, Friedman, &amp; Gelman 2019). At age two, young
children&rsquo;s behavior already suggests some concern with ownership
rights, e.g., by protesting against a puppet&rsquo;s seizure of an
object they recently made (whereas protests were weaker in reaction to
seizure of a third-party&rsquo;s object; Kanngiesser &amp; Hood 2014).
In another study, 4-year-olds applied similar principles to harmless
interventions on others&rsquo; property as they did on others&rsquo;
body parts (Van de Vondervoort &amp; Friedman 2015; see also Van de
Vondervoort et al. 2017): for example, they judged disapproved
interventions on others as worse than disapproved interventions on
themselves&mdash;suggesting that children may acquire norms about
property by extrapolating from norms about bodily autonomy.</p>

<p>
Early research on children&rsquo;s concept of ownership revealed that
5-year-old children pay closer attention to information about the past
use of an object over information about future use. Furthermore,
attention to past use information plays a heightened role in
circumstances in which first possession is indicative of the
object&rsquo;s history (Friedman et al. 2013). To investigate whether
children view ownership as conferring the right of use or of
exclusion, Nancekivell and Friedman (2014) compared children&rsquo;s
judgments of the potential uses of non-owned objects to the uses of
owned objects, and discovered that children view non-owned objects as
amenable to multiple uses&mdash;much like objects they personally
owned, but unlike objects owned by someone else&mdash;indicating that
ownership appears to primarily confer the right of exclusion, and not
the right of use to the same degree.</p>

<p>
This short overview barely scratches the surface of the empirical
study related to property (for further reading, see Blumenthal 2010;
Nadler 2018; and Nancekivell, Friedman &amp; Gelman 2019). In sum,
developmental research indicates that children&rsquo;s concept of
ownership may arise by extending their concept of the body, and that
it depends on an object&rsquo;s history of use and confers a
relatively persistent right of exclusion. In this regard, existing
research points toward a rich intuitive basis for adults&rsquo;
beliefs about property. Although some philosophers have examined
issues in property, it is a comparatively overlooked area. X-Jur
research offers a new way to make philosophical progress in
understanding some of the property law&rsquo;s fundamental
concepts.</p>

<h4 id="ConLaw">2.2.4 Contract Law</h4>

<p>
The notion of consent plays a central role in moral and legal theory.
In an often-quoted passage, legal scholar Heidi Hurd (1996) notes
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
consent turns a trespass into a dinner party; a battery into a
handshake; a theft into a gift; an invasion of privacy into an
intimate moment; a commercial appropriation of name and likeness into
a biography. (1996: 123)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to the &ldquo;canonical view of consent&rdquo;, as
articulated in legal scholarship and moral philosophy, valid consent
can occur only when the consenter exercises their personal autonomy.
This account renders consent invalid when, for example, consent is
obtained using threats of physical violence, since the consent does
not reflect the person&rsquo;s autonomous choice. Similarly, consent
is&mdash;on the canonical view&mdash;invalidated by material deception
(see Sommers 2020: 2239). In cases of deception, the consenter&rsquo;s
autonomy is thwarted by the fact that knowledge about the act to which
they are consenting is deliberately withheld.</p>

<p>
In recent years, experimental research has gathered important insights
into the way people reason about the validity of consent (e.g.,
Sommers 2020; Demaree-Cotton &amp; Sommers 2022). For instance,
consider the following scenario:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Marvin has been in physical therapy for ankle pain and is
contemplating undergoing elective surgery to repair the tendon. He
cares deeply about whether the surgery is covered by his insurance; he
would refuse to have the surgery if he would have to pay out of
pocket. Marvin&rsquo;s doctor lies to him and says his insurance will
cover the procedure, when in reality, the doctor knows that Marvin
will need to pay out of pocket. Marvin says yes to the surgery.</p>
</div>

<p>
Did Marvin consent to his surgery? In Sommers&rsquo;s (2020) study,
66% of participants affirmed that Marvin consented to the surgery,
even though he was deceived by his doctor. Moreover,
&ldquo;participants saw the doctor as less deserving of
punishment&rdquo; in cases of deceived consent than in cases where
there&rsquo;s no assent at all (Sommers 2020: 2273). This same basic
pattern was documented in other cases of consent by deception,
involving sexual relations, police searches, and participation in
scientific research: Overall, participants did not take deception to
defeat consent.</p>

<p>
Together, these studies suggest discrepancies between the folk concept
of consent and the canonical understanding that prevails in the law.
Yet, jury instructions in the United States call upon jurors to employ
their own folk concept to inform their decisions, raising the concern
that they may deviate systematically from the legal understanding
(e.g., by treating mere assent obtained through deception as
consent).</p>

<p>
Viewing these features of the folk concept of consent as normatively
undesirable can inspire attempts to engage in &ldquo;conceptual
engineering&rdquo;&mdash;a concerted attempt to redefine a concept in
response to its perceived inadequacies. For example, scholars might
attempt to foster the adoption of an improved notion of consent that
precludes consent obtained by deception and/or demands the exercise of
autonomy.</p>

<p>
Other research has investigated the folk understanding of contracts.
According to the doctrinal view, a mutual communication of assent
(e.g., an offer from a buyer followed by acceptance of the offer from
the seller) suffices to establish a binding contract. Wilkinson-Ryan
and Hoffman (2015), however, show that participants consider a
contract to be binding at a later stage&mdash;when the transaction is
complete.</p>

<p>
In one of the authors&rsquo; studies, participants were asked to
imagine that they had signed a contract, and that the contract either
came into effect immediately and could be nullified anytime in the
first 72 hours, or that the contract would come into effect after 72
hours unless it was nullified before then. Participants reported being
more open to shopping around for a better alternative in the second
condition (in which the contract was not in effect) than in the first
(in which it was)&mdash;even though both groups of participants had
signed the contract and were able to render it void. Similarly,
participants appeared to view the private act of signing a contract as
more binding than an informal communication of assent to the other
party. Lastly, the research reveals how people&rsquo;s understanding
of contract formation is influenced by moral norms regarding
reciprocity: When describing an agreement to buy a used car,
participants were randomly assigned to consider a seller who either
shows signs of commitment to their agreement (getting the car detailed
and taking down a &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign) versus a comparable
seller who does not (because the car was recently detailed and parked
indoors). Participants were more reluctant to cancel the verbal
agreement with the first seller, whose actions of getting the car
detailed <em>after</em> the agreement (versus before) convey a greater
commitment. This suggests that norms of reciprocity underlie
people&rsquo;s reasoning about the bindingness of contracts.</p>

<h4 id="LegInt">2.2.5 Legal Interpretation</h4>

<p>
Much of the experimental jurisprudence of interpretation has examined
&ldquo;ordinary meaning&rdquo; (see Slocum 2015; Lee &amp; Mouritsen
2018; Tobia 2020), or the way an &ldquo;ordinary reader&rdquo; would
understand a legal text. This concept is especially important in
contemporary American legal interpretation, in which
&ldquo;textualists&rdquo; seek to interpret law&rsquo;s terms as they
would be understood by an ordinary or reasonable reader (see Scalia
&amp; Garner 2012). American courts have relied on dictionaries as an
important source of information about ordinary meaning. More recently,
corpus linguistics (e.g., Lee &amp; Mouritsen 2018) emerged as another
way to achieve the same goal. A series of experiments (Tobia 2020)
shows that, although legal interpreters see both dictionaries and
corpus linguistics as methods to uncover the same facts about language
(ordinary meaning), the conclusions about language delivered from both
methods diverge significantly from ordinary use as ascertained by
survey-experiments. For example, while many dictionary definitions
would classify an airplane as a &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;, common methods
in legal corpus suggest that an airplane is not within the ordinary
meaning (see also Lee &amp; Mouritsen 2018). Dictionaries offer
systematically more inclusive definitions, while corpus linguistics
reflect prototypical examples that are considerably narrower.</p>

<p>
As an alternative to those methods, X-Jurists have used
survey-experiments to uncover whether specific
&ldquo;linguistic&rdquo; interpretive canons accurately reflect
ordinary linguistic practices (e.g., Tobia, Slocum &amp; Nourse 2022;
Randall &amp; Solan 2025). For example, consider the rule &ldquo;no
cars, buses, trucks or other vehicles may enter the park&rdquo;. The
&ldquo;<em lang="la">ejusdem generis</em>&rdquo; interpretive canon
holds that when a list (like &ldquo;cars, buses, trucks&rdquo;) is
followed by a catchall phrase (like &ldquo;or other vehicles&rdquo;),
the catchall should be interpreted in line with the theme of the list.
So the ejusdem canon holds that &ldquo;other vehicles&rdquo; should be
construed to include only entities like cars, buses, and
trucks&mdash;perhaps including motorcycles but not including bicycles.
Recent work finds that, even though laypeople have not been taught the
Latin canon &ldquo;<em lang="la">ejusdem generis</em>&rdquo;, their
intuitive judgment about rule meanings reflects its guidance (Tobia,
Slocum &amp; Nourse 2022).</p>

<p>
Other studies address linguistic issues relevant to specific cases.
For example, several studies examined how ordinary people understand
causal phrases like &ldquo;because of&rdquo; (e.g., Macleod 2019,
2025), an issue at the center of Bostock v. Clayton County, 2020. As
another example, the question in Bondi v. VanDerStok, 2025, was
whether a non-assembled &ldquo;gun parts kit&rdquo; constitutes a
&ldquo;firearm&rdquo; within the meaning of a U.S. firearms law.
Waldon, Condoravdi, and colleagues (forthcominga) presented an
empirical and linguistic analysis of artifact nouns, such as
&ldquo;firearm,&rdquo; &ldquo;chair,&rdquo; and &ldquo;table,&rdquo;
to inform the case. The U.S. Supreme Court referred to this linguistic
analysis of artifact nouns in its opinion, which concluded that yes,
&ldquo;firearm&rdquo; includes some such gun parts kits. U.S. Courts
have also indicated interest in empirical methods to aid legal
interpretation. Several judicial decisions have cited corpus
linguistic studies, and in 2024, a Supreme Court opinion (Pulsifer v.
United States, 2024 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting)) cited an amicus brief
that summarized an experimental survey study of how ordinary Americans
understand negated conjunctions (Tobia, Egbert &amp; Lee 2023).</p>

<p>
Other studies have tested issues related to particular areas of law,
such as contract law (e.g., Furth-Matzkin 2025; see also Ben-Shahar
&amp; Strahilevitz 2017; Mouritsen 2019) and treaties in international
law (e.g., Pirker &amp; Skoze&#324; 2022; see Macleod 2025, for an
overview). While much of the X-Jur work in this area employs corpus
linguistics (e.g., Lee &amp; Mouritsen 2018) and survey-experiments
(e.g., Tobia 2020), scholars have also proposed the addition of other
methods, such as word embeddings (Choi 2024). Very recently some lower
court opinions have even cited ChatGPT in interpretation (e.g. Snell
v. United Specialty Ins. Co., 102 F.4th 1208, 1221 (11th Cir. 2024)
(Newsom, J., concurring)), a practice that has already generated some
critiques (e.g. Waldon, Schneider, et al. forthcomingb; Lee &amp;
Egbert 2024; Choi unpublished).</p>

<h4 id="OthAreLaw">2.2.6 Other Areas of Law</h4>

<p>
As the previous sections demonstrate, there is a voluminous literature
in particular experimental jurisprudence. We have highlighted some
major research areas, but inevitably, even this review omits important
work. X-Jurists have also explored perjury (Skoczen 2022), evidence
(Macleod 2023), health and disability law (Dorfman 2025), and,
doubtlessly, much more that we lack the space to cover. The
 <a href="https://nyupress.org/search-results/?series=psychology-and-the-law" target="other">NYU Press Psychology and the Law Series</a>
 includes a number of outstanding volumes that present research in law
and psychology, including in tort and property law, but also family
law, evidence, and environmental law. Many of these findings have
implications for theoretical debates in jurisprudence.</p>

<h3 id="EmpMet">2.3 Empirical Methodologies</h3>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="#GenOve">Section 1</a>,
 some researchers take experimental jurisprudence to be continuous
with the more traditional strands of jurisprudence. It is also not the
first movement in legal research to embrace empirical methods. Thus,
what marks it out against traditional jurisprudence, on the one hand,
and quantitative approaches in fields such as legal psychology and law
and economics, on the other, is the use of empirical methods to
investigate a broad range of philosophical questions about the law.
But general talk of &ldquo;empirical methods&rdquo; obscures the rich
palette of tools used by X-Jurists. To the extent that different
empirical methods play different roles in philosophical argumentation,
understanding the various methods helps clarify the philosophical
points made by scholars working within the movement. Thus, in this
section, we aim to define and exemplify some of the methods currently
in use within experimental jurisprudence.</p>

<h4 id="PsyMet">2.3.1 Psychological Methods</h4>

<p>
In their simplest form, psychological survey-experiments contrast
multiple (often two) vignettes that differ from one another
exclusively with regard to one property of interest, which is usually
referred to as the experimental manipulation or treatment.
Experimenters also ask participants at least one question about each
vignette. At the analysis stage, this question will serve as the
dependent variable to be explained in terms of the experimental
treatment.</p>

<p>
For instance, Kneer and Skocze&#324; (2023) were interested in whether
judgments about the objective probability that an event would have
occurred are affected by knowledge of the actual outcome in situations
where legal responsibility is salient. For their first two studies,
all conditions started with the following introduction:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Ms. Russel is the owner of a big strawberry farm. The homes of the
strawberry pickers are situated close to a river that runs through the
farm grounds. Two years ago, there was an unexpected flood, which
inundated the lodgings of the fruit pickers overnight. Some lost their
belongings and a few were injured. The next two years, Ms. Russel took
precautions during the rainy season to protect the workers&rsquo;
lodgings against flooding. However, there was no flooding in those
last two years. Ms. Russel believes that there will be no flood this
year. She decides not to install the temporary flood barriers this
year and uses a portion of the money budgeted for the flood barriers
to refurbish the kitchens in the workers&rsquo; houses instead.</p>
</div>

<p>
Then, participants in the &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; condition read the
following ending:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
As during the previous years, the river&rsquo;s water supply is low
all season and it never overflows. The fruit pickers are glad that the
money has been invested into the refurbishment of the kitchens.</p>
</div>

<p>
Participants in the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; condition received a vignette
that ended differently:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
It just so happens that there is a torrential downpour one night that
nobody saw coming. The lodgings are flooded within hours. Several
fruit pickers are severely injured and one worker and his two children
die a slow and painful death as they get trapped in a flooded
house.</p>
</div>

<p>
Here, the treatment was whether the outcome was neutral or bad. Thus,
this is the only factor that differs between the two versions of the
stimuli. All else remains the same, including the questions that
participants are asked to answer. In this study, one such question
was: &ldquo;[H]ow likely was it from an objective point of view that
there would be a flood this year?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In Study 1, Kneer and Skocze&#324; used a between-subjects design,
meaning that participants were randomly assigned to read either the
&ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; ending. Contrasting the
objective probability estimations between these two groups revealed a
fairly large difference. Since the only thing that changes from one
group to the other is the severity of the outcome, this means that
participants took into account the <em>actual</em> outcome (of a
flood) in their assessments of how probable it was that a flood would
occur. In other words, the observed difference in the dependent
variable was caused by the manipulation of the independent
variable.</p>

<p>
One important aspect of the experimental paradigm is that it is able
to detect effects that are unbeknownst to the participants themselves.
Kneer and Skocze&#324;&rsquo;s Study 1 can show that outcome severity
affects probability estimations even if participants themselves do not
introspectively or consciously recognize that it does so. This is one
reason why survey-experiments are a useful supplement to armchair
methods, which usually rely heavily on introspection.</p>

<p>
What the specific design employed in Study 1 cannot tell us is whether
each participant would see this difference between conditions as
problematic. Presumably, if participants take information about the
actual outcome to be relevant in assessing the outcome&rsquo;s
objective probability, the difference observed in Study 1 should
emerge equally in an adaptation of the experiment in which
participants consider both endings. If instead they deem the
difference in the actual outcome to be irrelevant, their objective
probability estimations should not differ across conditions.</p>

<p>
To test which of these were true, Kneer and Skocze&#324; ran the same
stimuli as a within-subjects design, in which participants received
both versions of the vignette (with differently named farmers)
side-by-side. In this modified design, there was no significant
difference in the dependent variable for both endings. The authors
interpret this to mean that the folk concept of objective probability
is outcome-insensitive. Hence, they characterize the pattern of
results that occurs in the between-subjects design as a performance
error in the way that people apply a non-moral concept in morally
laden situations.</p>

<p>
This is just one example that illustrates how X-Jurists can use
experiments to interrogate philosophical problems. Experimental
surveys are often much more complex, involving the independent
manipulation of several different variables and mixing elements of
within- and between-subjects designs. Still, the overall strategy for
drawing inferences about causal processes remains fundamentally the
same.</p>

<p>
In addition to survey-experiments, some experimental jurisprudence
research uses non-experimental (or cross-sectional) <em>surveys</em>
that ask the same set of questions to every participant&mdash;i.e.,
without introducing a manipulation. For example, Mart&iacute;nez and
Tobia (2023) surveyed law professors&rsquo; views on dozens of legal
theory debates, inspired by the Bourget and Chalmers (2014) survey of
philosophers. The results clarify expert legal theorists&rsquo;
beliefs about central debates, from legal interpretation (e.g.,
textualism or purposivism) to the justification of criminal punishment
(e.g., retributivism or deterrence).</p>

<p>
Other recent research has made use of other sophisticated
methods&mdash;that do not rely on participants&rsquo;
self-report&mdash;to gain insight into the cognitive processes that
underlie people&rsquo;s reasoning about legal concepts. Some
researchers have advocated for the use of &ldquo;eye-tracking&rdquo;
methods to better understand legal reasoning (see Engel &amp; Rahal
2022)&mdash;a popular method in psychology to document the trajectory
of participants&rsquo; visual attention during experimental tasks. The
key principle is that, when information is presented visually (as in
images or text), participants must orient the stimuli toward the
foveal region of the eye and fixate on the stimulus for at least 200
or 300 milliseconds to acquire the information. In this way,
eye-tracking data can provide a source of insight into the information
processing underlying behavior during a given task.</p>

<h4 id="BehMet">2.3.2 Behavioral Methods</h4>

<p>
While most experimental jurisprudence has used psychological methods
to study human judgment, some employ behavioral methods and/or study
human behavior. For example, Sheppard (2012) sought to determine how a
legal expert&rsquo;s caselaw decisions depend on the amount of time
available to decide. An empirical study recruited law students in a
simulated judicial decision-making exercise, in which some
participants had a two-minute time limit to write an opinion and
others had unlimited time. The group with a time limit had a lower
strength of conviction in their reasoning. For an overview of studies
on the influence of factors like time pressure and rules versus
standards on judicial behavior, see Sheppard (2025). As a second
example, Spamann et al. (2021) recruited judges from seven countries
to participate in a fifty-five-minute simulation of a judicial
decision. The study recorded the judge&rsquo;s use of specific
documents (e.g., briefs vs. statement of facts vs. precedent) to
better understand judicial behavior.</p>

<p>
In the neighboring discipline of economics, there is a long tradition
of research that seeks to mimic dynamic social interactions in a
controlled experimental setting. This research methodology draws on a
suite of &ldquo;economic games&rdquo;, in which multiple players
interact under varying instructions that allow them to increase their
monetary reward. The application of economic games to legally relevant
behavior has had a profound influence on the scientific understanding
of legal phenomena and given rise to a unique subdiscipline, now known
as law-and-economics.</p>

<p>
One of the most influential applications of economic games was geared
to understanding humans&rsquo; tendency to exact punishment on
antisocial partners (Fehr &amp; G&auml;chter 2000). By employing a
variation on the public goods game, this study documents
participants&rsquo; willingness to exact retributive punishment on
non-cooperative others, i.e., on those who fall short of the average
financial contribution to the common good. Participants tended to
exact punishment, reducing the non-cooperators&rsquo; wealth, even
though doing so implied a monetary cost (i.e., costly punishment),
even in one-off games (where they themselves would not stand to
benefit from the efficacy of punishment in bringing about
cooperation), and even when punishment occurs without communication
between the punisher and punishee (such that the punishee does not
know they have been punished; Nadelhoffer, Heshmati, et al. 2013). In
adaptations of the two-player trust game (Charness &amp; Dufwenberg
2006; Ederer &amp; Stremitzer 2017) document the role of guilt
aversion in sustaining trust and cooperation, in which a
promisor&rsquo;s aversion to disappointing a promisee underlies the
promisor&rsquo;s generosity. To the extent that those findings use
sophisticated empirical methods to address results that have been used
in philosophical arguments about the law, we can conceive of them as
part of X-Jur, their classification as law-and-economics
notwithstanding.</p>

<h4 id="ObsMet">2.3.3 Observational Methods</h4>

<p>
One of the inherent limitations of (artificial) experimental research
derives from participants&rsquo; intentional or unintentional tendency
to modify their behavior in reaction to the understanding that they
are being observed&mdash;and, particularly, to behave in ways that do
not reflect their real-world conduct (see
 <a href="#SkeAboSurExp">&sect;3.1.2</a>).
 To overcome this, some research in the social sciences turns to
observational methods, such as quasi-experimental techniques or
natural experiments, in which individuals&rsquo; real-world behavior
is documented under conditions that approximate those of a controlled
experiment.</p>

<p>
For example, Thompson et al. (2025) uploaded a random sample of
entries about past legal decisions in Ireland onto Wikipedia. They did
not announce this change, and simply observed the pattern of citation
of these (and other control cases not on Wikipedia) before and after
the upload. Thompson et al. report that Irish judges increased
citation of the Wikipedia cases more than to the control cases, taking
this result to indicate that the judiciary turns to Wikipedia. As
another example, consider Baumgartner and Kneer (2025), who examine
the ordinary concept of &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; by documenting
how the term is used in a corpus of naturally occurring language (see
also
 <a href="#AnaNatOccLan">&sect;2.3.5</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The previous two examples are explicitly situated within
legal-philosophical debates, but there is abundant prior experimental
research documenting the phenomenon of ingroup bias&mdash;the idea
that individuals judge other members of their demographic or
ideological ingroup more favorably than non-members. This pattern
could raise certain concerns for jurisprudence, namely, that judges
may deviate from certain standards of impartiality by evaluating
ingroup members in a more lenient manner than outgroup members.
Research by Lee Epstein and colleagues (2018) examined this precise
hypothesis by analyzing 4644 votes on 530 US Supreme Court cases
involving free speech (between 1953 and 2014) as a function of
justices&rsquo; political leanings. In line with evidence of ingroup
bias, the study demonstrated that&mdash;while liberal justices were
more supportive of free speech overall&mdash;both conservative and
liberal justices appeared to exhibit greater support for free speech
on cases that aligned with their political values.</p>

<h4 id="Neu">2.3.4 Neuroscience</h4>

<p>
Neuroscientific methods, including electroencephalography (EEG) and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), examine brain activity.
Some of these methods have been applied to make progress in legal
philosophy. For example, a longstanding debate in philosophy of
criminal law concerns the distinction between <em lang="la">mens
rea</em> categories (see
 <a href="#CriLaw">&sect;2.2.1</a>).
 For the purposes of criminal liability, what distinguishes
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; from &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;? A
collaboration of neuroscientists, lawyers, and philosophers
investigated this question with neuroscience (Vilares et al. 2017;
Jones, Montague, &amp; Yaffe 2020). They presented participants with
clear cases of knowing and reckless behavior and measured the
participants&rsquo; brain activity with fMRI; then, they found that a
machine learning algorithm trained on that data could correctly
classify people as knowing or reckless 71% of the time (in some
circumstances), based on data about brain activity alone. They argue
that this supports a &ldquo;detectable distinction&rdquo; in the brain
between knowledge and recklessness (Jones, Montague, &amp; Yaffe 2020:
21).</p>

<p>
Others have applied similar methods to questions in criminal law (see,
e.g., Buckholtz et al. 2008) and law and legal theory more broadly
(see, e.g., Jones, Schall, &amp; Shen 2021).</p>

<h4 id="AnaNatOccLan">2.3.5 Analysis of Naturally Occurring Language</h4>

<p>
Experimental jurisprudence is increasingly turning to methods that
analyze naturally occurring language. These methods include corpus
linguistics (e.g., Lee &amp; Mouritsen 2018), machine learning,
especially word embeddings (e.g., Choi 2024; Gries et al. 2024), and
large language models (e.g., Arbel &amp; Hoffman 2024; Engel &amp;
McAdams 2024; but see Waldon, Schneider, et al. forthcomingb; Lee
&amp; Egbert 2024; Choi unpublished). All these examples concern
debates about legal interpretation, but scholars have also used these
methods to analyze particular jurisprudential concepts, like
reasonableness (Nyarko &amp; Sanga 2022; Baumgartner &amp; Kneer 2025)
and consent (Nyarko &amp; Sanga 2022).</p>

<h2 id="CriExpJur">3. Critiques of Experimental Jurisprudence</h2>

<p>
Consider two types of critiques of experimental jurisprudence. The
first focuses on applying empirical methods to philosophical questions
more broadly; therefore, they are also described as
&ldquo;domain-general&rdquo; (Jim&eacute;nez 2025: 79). Such
criticisms apply to any attempt to inform philosophical debates using
empirical data and hold across a wide set of empirically informed
theoretical approaches (i.e., across experimental philosophy, not just
X-Jur). These critiques include: (a) the problem of replicability, (b)
limitations of survey and vignette studies, and (c) sampling from only
WEIRD (i.e., Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)
populations.</p>

<p>
The second type of criticism concerns the application of empirical
methods to <em>legal</em>-philosophical questions; therefore, they are
also described as &ldquo;domain-specific&rdquo; (Jim&eacute;nez 2025:
79). These criticisms focus on features uniquely associated with law
and the concepts essential to it. One such criticism aims to establish
that X-Jur&rsquo;s contributions are either <em>irrelevant</em> to
jurisprudence or of only limited significance, given the nature of
jurisprudence. A second type of domain-specific criticism is the
&ldquo;expertise defense&rdquo;, which argues that X-Jur incorrectly
focuses on laypeople, but to learn about the law and legal concepts,
it should examine the judgments of <em>legal</em> experts&mdash;such
as legal philosophers or officials.</p>

<h3 id="DomGenMetCri">3.1 Domain-General (Methodological) Criticisms</h3>

<p>
We will first discuss three domain-general critiques of experimental
methodology as applied to solving philosophical questions.</p>

<h4 id="Rep">3.1.1 Replicability</h4>

<p>
A recent effort to estimate the reproducibility of psychological
science concluded that only between 33% and 50% of studies published
in high-ranking psychology journals in 2008 could successfully be
replicated (Open Science Collaboration 2015). Put simply, this implies
that when re-running an experiment while adhering to the
authors&rsquo; methodological guidelines (in terms of sampling and
protocol) and ensuring ideal conditions under which to observe the
effect (i.e., high statistical power), the researchers&rsquo;
repetition of the experiment did not produce the initial published
result. More broadly, scholars in areas including psychology,
political science, medicine, and behavioral economics (e.g., Camerer
et al. 2016) have examined replicability, reporting some replications
and some failures of studies to replicate. Colloquially, these
replication failures have been described as a &ldquo;replication
crisis&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Given the close connections between the methods employed in
psychological research and those used in experimental jurisprudence
(see
 <a href="#PsyMet">&sect;2.3.1</a>),
 replication failures in psychology may have raised certain doubts
about the trustworthiness of published findings in experimental
jurisprudence. Unfortunately, there is currently no estimate of the
reproducibility of experimental jurisprudence, but Cova and colleagues
(Cova et al. 2021) attempted to replicate 40 studies in the
neighboring discipline of experimental philosophy published between
2003 and 2015, finding a replication rate of approximately 70%. This
suggests that experimental philosophy studies may be more trustworthy,
as a whole, than studies in psychological science. To the extent that
X-Jur is more closely related to experimental philosophy than to
psychology, that should give us reason for optimism.</p>

<p>
This might be due, in part, to changes adopted by the scientific
community in reaction to the so-called reproducibility crisis. Since
the publication of the Open Science Collaboration&rsquo;s paper,
researchers have adopted a series of research practices aimed at
ensuring reproducibility, such as making their data and analyses
available online and reporting pre-registered studies.
Pre-registration requires experimenters to pre-commit to various
choices including sample size, the precise analyses that will be
performed, and inclusion criteria&mdash;in order to reduce
&ldquo;researcher degrees of freedom&rdquo;, especially the
researchers&rsquo; freedom to hypothesize after the results are known
(also known as HARKing) which is thought to be one of the main causes
of the replication crisis phenomenon. Scholars have argued that
following these practices improves reproducibility and increases
scientific credibility (see Nosek et al. 2018). To the extent that
many works in X-Jur follow these guidelines (see, for instance, the
open data and stimuli for the cross-cultural
 <a href="https://osf.io/sk7r3/" target="other">Experimental Jurisprudence Cross-Cultural Study Swap</a>
 project), we have reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the
field&rsquo;s reproducibility.</p>

<p>
Many experimental philosophers use crowdsourcing platforms to recruit
participants, as this provides easy access to populations that are
more diverse than the convenience samples usually available in Western
College campuses (Behrend et al. 2011, see also
 <a href="#CriExpJur">&sect;3</a>).
 Recent research has found that the quality of data from one prominent
crowdsourcing provider (Amazon&rsquo;s MTurk) has deteriorated
dramatically in recent years (Chmielewski &amp; Kucker 2020; Peer et
al. 2021). This might raise alarms about the reproducibility of work
in X-Jur to the extent that X-Jurists rely on data from this platform.
Anecdotally, we know of many X-Jurists who have taken notice and
switched to different platforms and/or started to supplement their
data with other recruitment methods. Future studies should assess the
reproducibility of X-Jur directly, using systematic replication
attempts.</p>

<h4 id="SkeAboSurExp">3.1.2 Skepticism about Survey Experiments</h4>

<p>
As we have seen, experimental jurisprudence deploys a number of
different empirical methods to address its questions
 (<a href="#EmpMet">&sect;2.3</a>),
 but many use survey-experiments (Hoeft 2023; see also
 <a href="#PsyMet">&sect;2.3.1</a>).
 One well-known criticism in psychology is that the
participants&rsquo; responses to vignette-based studies might not
accurately reflect their behavior in real life (for a critical review
of the issue of ecological validity, see Holleman et al. 2020). While
much X-Jur work aims to understand human beliefs and judgment, and not
to predict human behavior, one should still worry about the
limitations of vignette studies: They are often abstract, limited in
detail, and detached from real-world context. If their features depart
too heavily from those of real-life legal decision-making, we would
not be able to conclude much about the latter based on the former
(Jim&eacute;nez 2025). Versions of this critique may also apply to
traditional philosophical thought experimentation, which is often
deliberately abstract and decontextualized (for discussion about this
worry in experimental philosophy, see Machery 2017). As in traditional
thought experimentation, experimental jurisprudence sometimes seeks to
test fundamental conceptual or legal criteria by either reducing a
scenario&rsquo;s detail or complexity or by considering exotic
hypotheticals.</p>

<p>
While critical of over-reliance on one specific method, these
objections to survey methods do not necessarily represent existential
threats to experimental jurisprudence. Instead, they point towards
ways in which the field would benefit from considering different
methods, such as qualitative research and behavioral experiments (see
Hoeft 2023). These methods would, according to critics, be better
suited &ldquo;to capture [&hellip;] the fact that law is a complex,
institutionalized, social and cultural practice&rdquo; (Jim&eacute;nez
2025: 90). At the very least, however, the criticism as stated
doesn&rsquo;t apply to the parts of experimental jurisprudence which
don&rsquo;t rely on survey-experiments, opting instead for
observational strategies, such as the studies that employ corpus
linguistics
 (<a href="#AnaNatOccLan">&sect;2.3.5</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="OveRelWEIPop">3.1.3 Over-Reliance on WEIRD Populations</h4>

<p>
A further criticism, emerging from a broader issue in the empirical
study of the mind, was highlighted by a team of anthropologists and
psychologists (Henrich, Heine &amp; Norenzayan 2010a; 2010b) in what
is now a landmark paper. Through a number of case studies, Henrich and
colleagues illustrate their broad claim that &ldquo;most people are
not WEIRD&rdquo;. Here, WEIRD refers to the acronym &ldquo;Western,
educated, industrialized, rich and democratic&rdquo; and the
psychological peculiarities of individuals raised in this cultural
context, through a flurry of studies comparing WEIRD and non-WEIRD
societies. This fact serves as a note of caution against interpreting
the results of empirical studies, so often conducted in European and
North American contexts, and increasingly through the use of online
platforms, as evidence of fundamental or cross-culturally robust
patterns of judgment (see also Blasi et al. 2022). This concern bears
on the generalizability of research in experimental jurisprudence; and
some researchers have sought to address it by investigating whether
and how legal concepts operate in different cultural and linguistic
contexts (Hannikainen et al. 2021; 2022; Tobia, Hannikainen, et al.
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
This criticism is usually framed in terms of the diversity of research
participants, but it could also be raised with respect to researchers.
Lack of researcher diversity can constrain or otherwise impact the
questions posed, theories developed, hypotheses tested, data
interpretations offered, and implications explored. Researchers in the
broader field of philosophy are unrepresentative in various respects;
as just one example, consider gender. A recent study found that women
constitute a smaller share of Ph.D.s in philosophy compared to even
many STEM fields (Leslie et al. 2015). Such concerns certainly extend
to sub-fields within legal philosophy. Much of general jurisprudence
concerns debates among famous men (e.g. Hart&ndash;Dworkin) and
co-citation analysis reveals general jurisprudence to be especially
self-referential and isolationist, when compared to other areas of
legal philosophy (Bystranowski 2024). It is too soon to tell how X-Jur
stands, either in general or comparatively to other
legal-philosophical fields, but the diversity of its researchers is
undoubtedly an important value to which to attend as the field
continues to develop.</p>

<p>
In concluding this section (&sect;3.1), it is worth noting that all
three critiques could apply to experimental philosophy of any
subject&mdash;law, morality, epistemology, and so on. Versions of
these general critiques might also be leveled at traditional
legal-philosophical methodology: Is one philosopher&rsquo;s intuition
about a thought experiment replicable, shared by (all) other legal
philosophers
 (<a href="#Rep">&sect;3.1.1</a>),
 does the often abstract nature of thought experimentation render it
insufficient to inform theory about complex legal systems
 (<a href="#SkeAboSurExp">&sect;3.1.2</a>),
 and does the philosophical literature rely too heavily on intuitions
of Western populations or philosophers of certain races, genders, or

 The debate about experimental jurisprudence has carried the
incidental benefit of turning attention to these foundational
questions about the general methodology of legal philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="DomSpeCri">3.2 Domain-Specific Criticisms</h3>

<p>
In this section, we consider a number of critiques of X-Jur that
appeal to specific features of jurisprudence. Where the critiques
discussed in &sect;3.1 could be leveled at many efforts to use
empirical data to bear on philosophy (whether in jurisprudence,
metaphysics, or aesthetics), the critiques discussed here are more
closely connected to specific facts or claims about the law or the
philosophical field of jurisprudence.</p>

<p>
This section considers two broad sets of &ldquo;domain-specific&rdquo;
critiques. First, we consider objections that, given the nature of
jurisprudence, the contributions offered by X-Jur are either
irrelevant or of limited significance
 (<a href="#XJurConTraJurIrrLim">&sect;3.2.1</a>).
 Second (in
 <a href="#IntExpNotOrdPeoMatForJur">&sect;3.2.2</a>),
 we consider the frequent objection that most X-Jur studies the wrong
population: ordinary people. Instead, this objection goes, X-Jur
should study populations with expertise in law or legal
philosophy.</p>

<h4 id="XJurConTraJurIrrLim">3.2.1 X-Jur&rsquo;s Contribution to Traditional Jurisprudence is Irrelevant or Limited</h4>

<p>
There is debate about whether X-Jur meaningfully contributes to
traditional jurisprudence, given the nature of jurisprudence and the
questions it asks. One possible position is that X-Jur contributes
nothing to these debates&mdash;the method is irrelevant. Perhaps
surprisingly, few have defended that claim in print. Instead, the vast
majority of such critiques assert a milder position: X-Jur has
<em>limited</em> relevance to traditional jurisprudence (e.g., Dickson
2022; Himma 2023; Jim&eacute;nez 2021; 2025).</p>

<p>
Some critics point to the limited usefulness of general X-Jur because
of the nature of general theorizing about the law. For instance,
Dickson (2022) is skeptical of what she calls &ldquo;vox pop&rdquo;
techniques in legal philosophy. Although conceding that survey data
might be useful she argues that &ldquo;such data could at best be a
starting point, and something for the legal philosopher to work with,
interpret, and extrapolate from&rdquo; (2022: 114). This is so because
legal philosophy is largely about extracting and interpreting
people&rsquo;s self-understandings in terms of law, which manifest
themselves (often implicitly) in a range of attitudes and behaviors in
which people make use of and draw distinctions about the law (2022:
113&ndash;114). These self-understandings &ldquo;do not come
pre-packaged and explicit such that the legal philosopher&rsquo;s job
is merely to record and reproduce them&rdquo; (Dickson 2022: 114).</p>

<p>
At least some defenders of X-Jur appear sympathetic to these
critiques, endorsing a similar distinction to Dickson&rsquo;s between
X-Jur as one &ldquo;step&rdquo; or one tool in the philosopher&rsquo;s
toolkit and X-Jur as a full &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; of traditional
methods. For many X-Jurists, collecting data is only the initial step,
with further steps requiring the interpretation and evaluation of the
data based on theoretical concerns (see discussion in Tobia 2023). In
fact, one of the features that distinguishes X-Jur from other
empirical approaches to the law is its goal to inform traditional
<em>philosophical</em> questions about the law (Tobia 2022, 2023;
Prochownik 2021). Thus, these scholars argue, X-Jur&rsquo;s approach
broadly is consistent with the general view of the character of legal
philosophy presented by Dickson (see also
 <a href="#ConExpJur">&sect;1.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Many defenders of X-Jur also appear sympathetic to Dickson&rsquo;s
second point: we can only learn so much about people&rsquo;s concepts
from eliciting intuitions in response to <em>surveys</em> :</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the self-understandings of those living under law are more implicit,
and diffuse, than the &ldquo;vox-pop&rdquo; or &ldquo;eliciting
intuitions&rdquo; notions connote. (Dickson 2022: 113)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The phrase &ldquo;vox-pop&rdquo; might suggest that X-Jur conducts
public opinion polls, but the vast majority of X-Jur research does not
employ a simple polling method. Instead, X-Jur uses varied research
methods (see
 <a href="#EmpMet">&sect;2.3</a>
 for a review), especially survey-experiments. Unlike a poll,
experiments can provide insight into which factors underlie
people&rsquo;s judgments and which features characterize
people&rsquo;s concepts, even when these are not immediately clear to
subjects themselves.</p>

<p>
This section has briefly reviewed the more common version of this
critique of X-Jur: It offers a limited contribution to jurisprudence,
but it cannot replace traditional philosophical inquiry. A closer
inspection of this debate reveals that there may not be many
substantial disagreements between these critics and the many
practitioners of experimental jurisprudence who see the method as
complementary to or continuous with traditional legal-philosophical
methods.</p>

<p>
However, it is possible to imagine a stronger criticism stating that
legal philosophy aims to reveal the deep nature of law as a phenomenon
that is not bound in any way by people&rsquo;s concept of it (e.g.,
Greenberg 2016: 1950). Under this view, any experimental endeavors to
reveal the folk concept of law would be irrelevant to legal
theorizing. However, since this broader criticism equally applies to
the whole tradition of conceptual jurisprudence and not experimental
jurisprudence specifically, we will not address it here (see, for
example, Dickson 2022: 123&ndash;134 for a critical discussion).</p>

<p>
Another critique claims that studies in general X-Jur (e.g., Miotto,
Almeida &amp; Struchiner 2023; Flanagan &amp; Hannikainen 2022;
Donelson &amp; Hannikainen 2020) are of limited relevance to
traditional conceptual debates in general jurisprudence because the
survey questions used by researchers in general X-Jur do not make
explicit all relevant implications of the different
legal-philosophical positions under test. Consequently, they fail to
trigger subjects&rsquo; actual beliefs about the law, because subjects
would presumably change their responses if they had knowledge of the
difficulties associated with them. Thus, these survey-experiments fail
to expose the conceptual practices of competent speakers and,
consequently, cannot inform jurisprudential debates concerning the
folk concept of law. In other words, a survey could only tell us
something about ordinary beliefs if it clarified to participants
&ldquo;all of the implications of an answer that might affect how they
respond&rdquo; (Himma 2023: 355). At the very least, the researchers
should make sure that survey responses reflect &ldquo;all potentially
relevant uncontentious conceptual and logical implications&rdquo;
(Himma 2023: 355).</p>

<p>
To give an example: Himma (2023) criticizes Miotto, Almeida and
Struchiner (2023; discussed in
 <a href="#Coe">&sect;2.1.2</a>)
 for not spelling out that saying the society of morally perfect
angels has law &ldquo;entails that it is not a necessary condition for
the existence of a legal system that it criminalises harmful
acts&rdquo; (2023: 355). According to Himma, if it was made clear to
the participants that, in a society of morally perfect beings, there
is no need for criminal norms (as well as a vast array of other legal
norms that characterize human societies), their intuitions about
whether angels have a legal system would change, leading to different
results. While other studies by these researchers arguably circumvent
this specific criticism (see Study 5), there is no doubt that they
also fail to specify all (even uncontentious) implications that could
be relevant.</p>

<p>
A strong reading of this criticism entails that no experiment could
ever lead to conclusive evidence about folk concepts. After all, no
matter how long the survey vignettes and response options were, some
possible implications that could affect participants&rsquo; responses
would always be left to spell out. In that stronger variant,
Himma&rsquo;s objection leads to global skepticism about survey
data&rsquo;s usefulness for solving conceptual issues in philosophy
and other related fields (and would thus arguably belong to the
domain-general family of criticisms). After all, vignettes in moral
psychology, the psychology of causation, and many other complex
disciplines also fail to specify all potentially relevant implications
that might affect lay responses. Moreover, one might argue that this
is intentional. Psychologists refrain from providing explicit
theoretical information to avoid leading participants to respond in
accordance with the theories that were supposed to be under test.</p>

<p>
A milder interpretation of this criticism assumes that the researchers
in X-Jur should always aim to clarify in their surveys all relevant
uncontentious implications of adopting certain positions by
participants. For example, according to this criticism, Miotto and
colleagues should describe in their study &ldquo;what norms a society
of real angels would need in order to do what they need done&rdquo;
(Himma 2023: 355), but not other uncontentious implications that are
irrelevant. An experiment containing this information would then lead
to conclusive evidence about the relationship between the folk concept
of law and coercion. This criticism, whether successful or not,
doesn&rsquo;t challenge the relevance of X-Jur <em>per se</em>. It
simply points out ways in which armchair philosophy might lead to
better X-Jur. Also, the criticism does not seem to apply on equal
terms to all legal-philosophical questions. For instance, one may
doubt whether there exists an uncontentious theory regarding the
relationship of law and morality (Flanagan 2024).</p>

<h4 id="IntExpNotOrdPeoMatForJur">3.2.2 The Intuitions of Experts, Not Ordinary People, Matter for Jurisprudence</h4>

<p>
Another important criticism of X-Jur that applies to both general and
particular X-Jur boils down to the claim that it studies the wrong
population. Most existing X-Jur studies laypeople. However, the
expertise defense claims, it should <em>only</em> study experts (e.g.,
legal theoreticians, legal practitioners, or legal officials).
Laypeople&rsquo;s judgments on legal matters are irrelevant to legal
theorizing, either because they are unreliable (Himma 2023),
indeterminate (Jim&eacute;nez 2021, 2025; Sebok 2021), or not
authoritative (Jim&eacute;nez 2025). One needs many years of
university-level legal or philosophical education (Himma 2023) and
competence in legal reasoning (Jim&eacute;nez 2021; Sebok 2021; Himma
2023) to be able to competently address jurisprudential questions.
Moreover, some claim that only the beliefs and attitudes of people in
certain positions of authority&mdash;and not those of the population
at large&mdash;matter in answering questions about legal concepts
(Jim&eacute;nez 2025).</p>

<p>
This criticism resembles the objection formulated by traditional
philosophers against experimental philosophy, which became known as
the &ldquo;expertise objection&rdquo; or &ldquo;expertise
defense&rdquo; (see generally Nado 2014; but see Jim&eacute;nez 2021:
14&ndash;15). The expertise objection against experimental philosophy
assumes that ordinary people&rsquo;s responses to hypothetical
philosophical cases (but not those of experts) are susceptible to
philosophically irrelevant factors and are thus unreliable. Therefore,
it&rsquo;s the philosophers&rsquo; intuitions that should matter in
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The similarity between the expertise objection in general X-Phi and in
X-Jur is especially close when it comes to questions in general
jurisprudence. For instance, one critic claimed that &ldquo;advanced
training in law or philosophy is needed to address conceptual
questions&rdquo; (Himma 2023: 369). That would be the case because,
although linguistic competence requires speakers to correctly apply
terms to easy cases (i.e., cases in which the term clearly applies or
clearly does not apply), it doesn&rsquo;t include the ability to
correctly decide whether the term applies in hard cases. So, while
ordinary speakers may be able to decide when the term
&ldquo;law&rdquo; applies in a variety of easy cases, they do not have
the deepened conceptual competence that would allow them to apply the
term accurately in hard cases concerning the borders of the
term&rsquo;s application, such as those disputed by legal theorists
(2023: 366&ndash;368). Doing so requires an extra skill to extract
from these patterns &ldquo;shared metaphysical views about the nature
of the corresponding kind&rdquo; (2023: 372), which can only be
acquired by a special kind of academic training. This argument leads
to the conclusion that, in cases of conflict, lay intuitions are
irrelevant (2023: 373).</p>

<p>
Regarding questions in particular jurisprudence, the expertise
objection takes a different form. Legal systems are at least partly
constituted by social facts, such as the beliefs and behaviors of
legal officials (e.g., Hart 1961). Thus, the beliefs of legal
officials&mdash;but not those of laypeople&mdash;are partly
constitutive of law. If that account of the nature of law is true (for
discussion, see Adler 2006), then we should care exclusively about
legal officials as a population, given that it is their beliefs and
actions (and, by extension, their concepts) which create legal meaning
(Jim&eacute;nez 2021; 2025).</p>

<p>
A related critique of particular X-Jur has claimed that it has limited
explanatory power with regards to legal theory and practice as
compared to traditional jurisprudence. Consider the research by Knobe
and Shapiro (2021), discussed in
 <a href="#TorLaw">Section 2.2.2</a>.
 The paper&rsquo;s main claim is that the effects of norm violation
over the ordinary notion of causation mirror the case law doctrine of
proximate cause to a large extent. Moreover, they argue that this is
so because the legal concept of a proximate cause builds upon the
ordinary notion of causation, even though it also departs from it in
some ways. According to Sebok (2021), however, an alternative legal
rule, known as the risk rule, explains contemporary case law even
better than ordinary causation can. While in some tort law cases the
results of applying Knobe and Shapiro&rsquo;s &ldquo;abnormality
test&rdquo; and the risk rule align, other cases are better accounted
for in terms of the risk rule. This, Sebok points out, &ldquo;reveal
the limits of the use of research into ordinary judgments about
causation for law&rdquo; (2021: 4).</p>

<p>
One response to this debate has noted that Sebok&rsquo;s objection
(risk rule runs counter to judgments of ordinary causation) is itself
offering an empirically testable claim (Tobia 2022: 768). One could
think of similar objections to other findings in particular X-Jur
where skeptics would point to alternative legal sources as competing
explanations to the ones rooted in ordinary reasoning. All of those
would depend on empirical facts about the legal rule&rsquo;s
congruence or incongruence with lay intuitions and relative
explanatory merit.</p>

<p>
The expertise objection against general X-Jur as conceived above faces
at least two significant challenges. First, it is in &ldquo;need to
offer a theory about why the opinions of experts is to be preferred to
the folk when it comes to law&rdquo;; second, it &ldquo;needs to
specify the sort of expertise required and to think about who has that
expertise&rdquo; (Donelson 2023: 37; for further discussion of these
questions, see also Finnis 2011; Atiq 2025; Marmor 2013).</p>

<h5 id="WhoVieMat">3.2.2.1 Whose Views Matter?</h5>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s consider possible answers to the <em>who</em> question
first. Who are the relevant experts capable of answering difficult
conceptual questions in general jurisprudence? Critics of X-Jur have
proposed three primary answers: (a) legal philosophers, or perhaps the
narrower category of &ldquo;theorists with PhD in philosophy or
law&rdquo; (Himma 2023: 371), (b) &ldquo;lawyers&rdquo; more broadly
(2023: 372), and (c) &ldquo;legal officials&rdquo; (Jim&eacute;nez
2021). None of these options is free from controversy.</p>

<p>
Consider the view that it&rsquo;s <em>legal philosophers</em> whose
views matter. It is not clear why legal philosophers&rsquo; intuitions
about the law would be epistemically superior to those of laypeople
(Donelson 2023; Flanagan 2024). For instance, many legal philosophers
did not attend law school, which may put into question whether their
understanding of legal systems is sufficient to decide hard conceptual
questions about the law (Donelson 2023: 38). Moreover, even if we
would only consider the views of legal philosophers who did attend law
school, the mere fact that certain intuitions are shared by such group
does not in itself speak in favor of their accuracy; it may as well be
that people who endorse certain intuitions tend to become legal
philosophers (Flanagan 2024; cf. Cummins 1998). Finally, accepting
that legal philosophers have a very important role in coming up with
theories that build upon folk concepts (as argued by Dickson 2022;
Atiq 2025) isn&rsquo;t to say that we should <em>poll</em> legal
philosophers. Instead, one could accept that advice by using poll data
collected from any population as an input for philosophical
reflection.</p>

<p>
How about legal practitioners or officials (Himma 2023; Jim&eacute;nez
2021)? It is arguable that at least some sorts of legal expertise
(e.g., being an attorney or a judge) may provide individuals with a
predictive advantage similar to the one scientific experts have over
laypeople, making them better candidates for relevant experts than
legal philosophers (Flanagan 2024; cf. Donelson 2023: 37;
Jim&eacute;nez 2021). However, it is unclear that legal practitioners
have a conceptual competence to decide general-level theoretical
questions concerning the nature of law, as one can be a fully capable
practitioner of law without understanding its nature as a social
practice (Jim&eacute;nez 2025: 87); especially if one considers that
&ldquo;some jurisdictions and law schools fail to require aspiring
attorneys to learn anything about such questions&rdquo; (Donelson
2023: 37). Moreover, prioritizing officials&rsquo; judgments about
what the concept of law is has been charged with circularity--it is
not possible to define legal officials without a prior concept of law,
which, therefore, must be decided in other ways than by consulting
legal officials (Flanagan 2024). Finally, this view has troubling
consequences for the traditional methodology of jurisprudence. Legal
philosophers are usually not legal officials directly shaping the
law&rsquo;s content. If so, then this version of the expertise
objection implies that &ldquo;today&rsquo;s experimental jurisprudence
is largely looking in the wrong place&mdash;but so have decades of
traditional jurisprudence&rdquo; (Tobia 2022: 769).</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the choice of population might be less consequential than
the debate might suggest, given that several recent X-Jur studies
found similar patterns in how the folk and legal experts respond to
hypothetical legal cases (e.g., Kneer &amp; Bourgeois-Gironde 2017;
Prochownik et al. 2025). Thus, for at least some questions, examining
ordinary concepts also illuminates legal experts&rsquo; concepts
(Prochownik et al. 2025; Tobia 2022: 765&ndash;770).</p>

<p>
However, the correspondence between lay concepts and legal concepts is
not universal. Other studies have uncovered differences between
laypeople&rsquo;s and legal experts&rsquo; concepts (e.g., Tobia 2024
on the concept of intent). And other studies found that lay intuitions
diverge from the law (e.g., Robinson &amp; Darley 1995).</p>

<p>
A final complication in this debate about &ldquo;whose views
matter&rdquo; is that there is sometimes disagreement <em>within</em>
these populations. Several experimental jurisprudence studies find
that laypeople disagree with each other (see, e.g.,
 <a href="#ConRul">&sect;2.1.1</a>.
 on laypeople&rsquo;s rule violation judgments). And among experts,
there is sometimes disagreement. For example, consider the question of
whether experts endorse legal positivism. Bourget and Chalmers (2014:
12) surveyed <em>philosophers</em>, finding that only 40% endorse
legal positivism; yet a study of American law professors finds that a
much larger proportion (74%) endorse legal positivism (Martinez &amp;
Tobia 2023). Even if a legal philosopher concludes that laypeople are
not the right population to consult, the choice of which expert
population (e.g., professors of philosophy or professors of law) makes
a difference. And empirical work can surface useful facts about the
existence and nature of such disagreements.</p>

<h5 id="HowDoeExpMatJur">3.2.2.2 How Does Expertise Matter in Jurisprudence?</h5>

<p>
Now, consider the second challenge faced by the expertise objection as
applied to general X-Jur&mdash;providing a story of <em>why</em>
relevant expertise would make a difference (Donelson 2023: 37). One
possible answer is that experts are capable of reconstructing shared
assumptions and implications of the conceptual practices that, in
addition to these practices themselves, determine the conditions of
concepts&rsquo; application in hard cases (Himma 2023: 367). Himma
observes that deciding hard cases involves considering counterfactual
hypothetical cases&mdash;an ability that is essential for academic
training in law and legal philosophy. If so, then theorists in law and
philosophy who have undergone training in counterfactual reasoning
would have an advantage in addressing difficult conceptual questions
(2023: 372). This story relies on the assumption that &ldquo;people
need some training in counterfactual reasoning to do it
competently&rdquo; (2023: 372). However, scientific findings suggest
that the ability for counterfactual reasoning is a part of ordinary
human cognition that already emerges in childhood (Flanagan 2024; cf.
Byrne 2016).</p>

<p>
Another &ldquo;why&rdquo; answer (Jim&eacute;nez 2021, 2025) states
that legal experts have authority over the meaning of
&ldquo;law&rdquo; because their conceptual practices and
understandings largely shape the referent of this concept (i.e., the
way the law operates in reality). However, others challenge that
&ldquo;law really is a concept fixed by expert opinion&rdquo;
(Donelson 2023: 37; Tobia 2022): Arguably, &ldquo;law&rdquo; is not a
concept determined exclusively based on the expert&rsquo;s views, like
it is, for instance, in the case of scientific concepts (Donelson
2023: 37; see also Adler 2006). This seems to find confirmation in the
widely shared view in jurisprudence that ordinary intuitions matter
for theorizing about the concept of law (e.g., Dickson 2022).</p>

<p>
A closely related story focuses on particular legal concepts, such as
&ldquo;proximate cause&rdquo; or &ldquo;consent&rdquo; (Jim&eacute;nez
2021). Again, the argument is that these concepts have their legal
meaning determined by legal authorities alone, even if there might be
substantial overlap with laypeople&rsquo;s folk concepts. However,
this would go against the perspective often explicitly taken in
judicial and scholarly writing, which grants an important role to
ordinary people&rsquo;s understanding of legal terms (Flanagan
2024).</p>

<p>
In concluding, consider a final different proposal about what kind of
expertise matters in jurisprudence. Rather than locating expertise in
one population that has the &ldquo;right&rdquo; intuitions, this view
understands conflicts in intuitions and the complex relationship among
lay, philosophical, and legal concepts as sites worthy of
philosophical exploration. This view begins by noting that, in many
legal systems, ordinary people also create law&mdash;contributing
directly to the production of legal content as jurors deciding mixed
questions or as statutory interpreters. Moreover, any legal expert
(whether a legal philosopher or legal official) was once an ordinary
person, and it is plausible that they bring some aspects of that
ordinary experience and understanding to law. There are similar
considerations about legal language: Law is clearly written and
expressed with technical language, but it is not a foreign language to
its ordinary citizens. Legal notions&mdash;cause, consent,
reasonableness, intent&mdash;share names with similar notions that we
use in ordinary life, whose legal meanings are not entirely distinct
from their ordinary ones. Empirical study of ordinary notions and
ordinary people can help disentangle the ordinary from the legal
(Tobia 2023: 2507).</p>

<p>
On this proposal, experimental jurisprudence plays a
<em>methodological</em> role in jurisprudence. The question about
whether law should adopt or even focus on the understanding of an
ordinary person, legal philosopher, legal academic, or legal official
is <em>itself</em> a worthy jurisprudential question. In many legal
domains, there are plausible reasons to consider both ordinary and
expert understandings of law. The relevant expertise of legal
philosophers includes generating theories and hypotheses about what
connects or distinguishes legal notions from corresponding ordinary
ones. Philosophers have long theorized about the relationship between
ordinary notions (e.g., ordinary cause) and legal ones (e.g., legal
cause) and informed legal argument with thought experiments about
ordinary notions. This perspective sees experimental jurisprudence as
playing a similar methodological role as these traditional methods of
philosophical analysis: Conducting experiments about how laypeople,
philosophers, and legal officials understand law can unearth important
facts for improved jurisprudential debate. These facts do not
generally <em>resolve</em> jurisprudential debates, but they provide
new and sharper insights for philosophical analysis of law.</p>
