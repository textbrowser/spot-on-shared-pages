<h1>Reasons for Action: Justification, Motivation, Explanation</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Apr 24, 2016; substantive revision Thu Aug 22, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Why should the UN intervene in this international crisis? Why did the
Ancient Egyptians mummify their dead? Should Huck Finn have helped Jim
escape and, if so, why? Why is she selling her car? What shall we do
this evening? Questions like these that explicitly or implicitly ask
for reasons, specifically reasons for action, are ubiquitous. Most
contemporary philosophers who have sought to understand the nature of
reasons for acting start by distinguishing two kinds:
&ldquo;normative&rdquo; reasons&mdash;that is, reasons which, very
roughly, favour an action; and &ldquo;motivating&rdquo;
reasons&mdash;which, again roughly, are the reasons for which someone
acts. There are, in addition, reasons that explain an action without
favouring it or having motivated the agent.</p>

<p>
A clear understanding of reasons for acting in their favouring,
motivating and explanatory functions is of relevance to the philosophy
of action, ethics, political philosophy and the philosophy of law. The
essential issues about these reasons: what they are, and how they
relate to each other and to actions, are of wider concern.</p>

<p>
This entry examines the various accounts that philosophers have given
of these different kinds of reasons and their interconnections, as
well as the disagreements among them about these matters. The focus
will be on reasons for acting&mdash;commonly called &ldquo;practical
reasons&rdquo;. For the most part, the entry will leave aside
questions about reasons for responses other than actions&mdash;for
instance, reasons for believing, wanting, and feeling. This is not to
deny that a central question in the theory of reasons concerns the
possibility of a unified account of reasons that comprises reasons for
any kind of response.</p>

<h2 id="VarPraRea">1. The Variety of (Practical) Reasons</h2>

<p>
People engage in practical reasoning: they deliberate about what to do
and how to do it. And they often act in light of or guided by
reasons&mdash;which can then feature in an explanation of their
actions and, sometimes, justify them. These ideas go back to Plato
(<em>Protagoras</em> and <em>Republic</em>, Book 4) and Aristotle
(<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, Bks VI and VII, and <em>De Anima</em>,
III.10; see Price 2011) and they have been a constant theme in the
history of philosophy. In the eighteenth century, David Hume and
Immanuel Kant offered radically different views on the role and
importance of Reason (the faculty of reason) in guiding and justifying
our behaviour. Their contributions remain influential today, but in
the past sixty years, the focus of discussion has shifted from the
faculty of reason to <em>reasons</em>: roughly, considerations that
guide or justify our actions. In the philosophy of mind, interest in
reasons arose from the thought that intentional actions are done for
reasons&mdash;a view connected to Elizabeth Anscombe&rsquo;s
<em>Intention</em> (1957) and explicitly defended by Donald Davidson
in his influential paper &ldquo;Actions, Reasons, and Causes&rdquo;
(1963). In the field of ethics and normativity, broadly understood,
interests in reasons arose especially from questions about the
authority of morality (as in, e.g., Nagel 1970; Foot 1972, Williams
1979), as well as from connections between reasons and notions such as
justification, obligations, excuses, rationality, and moral
worth&mdash;among others.</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the introduction, contemporary authors tend to
distinguish between &ldquo;normative&rdquo; and
&ldquo;motivating&rdquo; reasons. Jonathan Dancy (2000), who discusses
the history of this distinction, notes that this contemporary
classification doesn&rsquo;t always map neatly onto their alleged
ancestors, for instance, Francis Hutcheson&rsquo;s (1728). Whatever
its history, the distinction is now accepted by most if not all
contemporary philosophers who write on this topic (representative
examples include Raz 1975; Smith 1994; Scanlon 1998; Dancy 2000;
Schroeder 2007; Alvarez 2010; Parfit 2011; Markovits 2014; Lord 2018;
McHugh &amp; Way 2022).</p>

<p>
A normative reason is a reason (for someone) to act&mdash;in T.M.
Scanlon&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;a consideration that counts in favour
of&rdquo; someone&rsquo;s acting in a certain way (1998: 17). A
motivating reason is a reason for which someone acts&mdash;a reason
which guides their action. Since we can often explain what a person
does by citing their reasons, motivating reasons are sometimes also
called &ldquo;explanatory reasons&rdquo;. However, recent authors tend
to distinguish motivating and explanatory reasons and there are good
grounds for doing so (see
 <a href="#MotExpRea">section 3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
How should this distinction be understood? On an influential view
(Baier 1958; Dancy 2000; Hieronymi 2011), this is just a distinction
concerning different things reasons can do. Dancy writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When I call a reason &ldquo;motivating&rdquo;, all that I am doing is
issuing a reminder that the focus of our attention is on matters of
motivation, for the moment. When I call it &ldquo;normative&rdquo;,
again all that I am doing is stressing that we are currently thinking
about whether it is a good reason, one that favours acting in the way
proposed (Dancy 2000: 2&ndash;3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The thought here is that talk of different kinds of reasons can be
understood in terms of the different roles that reasons can play.
These different roles become apparent when we attend to different
questions we can ask about reasons. For instance, we may ask whether
there is <em>a reason for</em> the Chancellor to introduce a
&ldquo;sugar tax&rdquo; for drinks and ask also what <em>the
Chancellor&rsquo;s reason</em> for introducing such a tax was. The
first is about reasons that favour actions (normative), the second
about reasons that guide agents (motivating). Note that the same
reason may answer both questions. For example, <em>that the tax will
reduce child obesity</em> may be both a reason for the Chancellor to
introduce a &ldquo;sugar tax&rdquo; (normative reason) and the
Chancellor&rsquo;s reason for doing so (motivating reason). But people
don&rsquo;t always act for the reasons that favour their doing
something&mdash;even when they do what the reasons that apply to them
favour. A corrupt Chancellor may be motivated to introduce a sugar tax
because it will benefit her husband&rsquo;s low-sugar drinks
company&mdash;but that is not a normative reason for her, as
Chancellor, to introduce that tax. If this way of understanding talk
about different kinds of reasons is right, perhaps the picture is more
complex than the dichotomy of &ldquo;normative vs. motivating&rdquo;
reasons suggests&mdash;as will be discussed in
 <a href="#MotExpRea">section 3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
A seemingly stronger, although consistent, interpretation of the
distinction treats normative and motivating/explanatory reasons as
entities of different ontological kinds. Accordingly, normative
reasons are objective and mind-independent: they are facts, or truths,
or &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; things, such as states of affairs, etc.;
motivating reasons, by contrast, are subjective and mind-dependent:
mental entities such as mental states of agents&mdash;or their
contents. These issues will be explored further below.</p>

<p>
The following section focuses on normative reasons.
 <a href="#MotExpRea">Section 3</a>
 focuses on motivating reasons and
 <a href="#RelBetNorMotRea">section 4</a>
 discusses the relation between normative and motivating reasons.</p>

<h2 id="NorRea">2. Normative Reasons</h2>

<p>
A reason is said to be a &ldquo;normative reason&rdquo; for someone to
act because it favours their so acting: it supports, or makes a case
for, or helps justify, that course of action. More can be said about
what this amounts to by focusing on two roles normative reasons can
play.</p>

<p>
First, normative reasons play a <em>deontic role</em>: they explain an
action&rsquo;s deontic status for someone&mdash;that is, whether, all
things considered, she ought, must or may do that thing. If a reason
favours my doing something, then I have a <em>pro tanto</em> reason to
do it: it is to that extent right for me to do it. But there may also
be a reason against my doing it: a <em>pro tanto</em> reason not to do
it. The fact that a joke is funny may be a reason to tell it; but that
it will embarrass someone may be a reason against. So, I have a reason
to tell the joke and a different reason not to tell it. Whether, all
things considered, I ought to tell the joke depends on whether either
of the reasons &ldquo;outweighs&rdquo; or otherwise
&ldquo;defeats&rdquo; the other: if the reason for telling the joke is
outweighed by the reason against it, then I ought not tell the joke.
If neither defeats the other, then, I <em>may</em> tell it&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s not the case that I ought to tell it.</p>

<p>
Second, normative reasons play a <em>deliberative role</em>: they are
things it&rsquo;s appropriate to pay attention to in deliberation.
When considering whether to tell the joke, I should take into account
both that it&rsquo;s funny, and that it&rsquo;ll embarrass someone.
And if the latter reason outweighs the former, and I deliberate well,
I&rsquo;ll decide not to tell the joke, precisely because it will
embarrass someone. (In that case, this consideration will be my
<em>motivating reason</em>. Thus, the deliberative role of normative
reasons makes them potential motivating reasons. More on this in
 <a href="#MotExpRea">section 3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Can we say more about what exactly normative reasons are, given these
two roles they can play? This question raises two issues: (i) an
ontological one about what sort of entities can be normative reasons
for action; and (ii) a constitutive issue about what it is for an
entity of the relevant sort to favour a particular course of action.
We address them in turn, before discussing some further issues about
normative reasons.</p>

<h3 id="OntNorRea">2.1 The Ontology of Normative Reasons</h3>

<p>
When it comes to ontology, ordinary language is liberal. We say that
your upcoming birthday, or the weather, or your wish to see red
squirrels, is a reason to visit the Isle of Wight. This might suggest
that events, things, and states of mind, among other kinds, can all be
normative reasons. But such reason claims can be rephrased using
&ldquo;that&rdquo; clauses. For instance, that the weather will be
nice, that it&rsquo;s your birthday, or that you want to see squirrels
can be a reason to visit the Isle of Wight (Schroeder 2007:
20&ndash;21). Moreover, only what is the case can favour or justify
actions: if the weather won&rsquo;t be nice on Sunday, then the
weather doesn&rsquo;t support visiting then. Consequently,
philosophers tend to hold that normative reasons are <em>facts</em>
(Raz 1975; Scanlon 1998; contrast Fantl &amp; McGrath 2009; Gibbons
2010; Howard 2021).</p>

<p>
This apparent consensus is complicated by two issues. First, some
philosophers distinguish between &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and
&ldquo;subjective&rdquo; (or sometimes &ldquo;apparent&rdquo;)
normative reasons. Roughly, objective reasons are the facts that count
for or against acting: considerations an informed adviser would take
into account. Subjective reasons are things you believe and that might
make it reasonable to act. Since you might act reasonably on false
beliefs, subjective reasons cannot be facts (Schroeder 2008; Parfit
2011; see also Fogal &amp; Worsnip 2021). This entry will continue to
use &ldquo;normative reason&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;objective normative
reason&rdquo; unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>
The second complication is that there is disagreement about what facts
are: are they concrete or abstract entities? Is a fact the same as the
corresponding true proposition, or is it the &ldquo;truth-maker&rdquo;
of the proposition? Among those who hold that normative reasons are
facts, some identify reasons with true propositions (Darwall 1983;
Smith 1994; Scanlon 1998; Alvarez 2010; Setiya 2014; Lord 2018; or
with &ldquo;the truth of a proposition&rdquo; (Hyman 2015). Others
reject this view; for example, Dancy (2000, 2018) and Mantel (2018) do
so on the grounds that propositions are abstract and representational
(they represent the way the world is) but, they say, reasons must be
concrete and non-representational (they are &ldquo;ways the world
is&rdquo;). These problems are complex and have many ramifications.
For present purposes, this entry will ignore them and continue to
speak of normative reasons as facts.</p>

<h3 id="ConNorRea">2.2 The Constitution of Normative Reasons</h3>

<p>
The second issue is what it is for an entity of the relevant
ontological category to favour an action. Given our assumption that
normative reasons are facts, the issue is thus what it is for a fact
to be a normative reason for a particular agent to undertake a
particular course of action? What is it for, say, the fact that the
joke is funny to &ldquo;favour&rdquo; my telling it? This question
asks for an account of the relation that obtains between a fact, a way
of acting, and an agent, when that fact is a reason for that agent to
act in that way. (A relation that may have further relata&mdash;e.g.,
time and circumstances [Skorupski 2010; Scanlon 2014]).</p>

<p>
Some hold that no informative answer to this question is possible: the
idea of a reason is primitive. Although we may offer metaphors, such
as that reasons &ldquo;count in favour&rdquo; of actions, these
metaphors don&rsquo;t explain reasons in more basic terms (Hampton
1998; Scanlon 1998, 2014; Dancy 2004; Skorupski 2010; Parfit 2011).
Others disagree. Very broadly, we can distinguish three (not mutually
exclusive) groups of views among the latter.</p>

<p>
The first group aims to characterise reasons in terms of their deontic
role, i.e., their capacity to determine the deontic status of actions.
(This approach has roots in W.D. Ross&rsquo;s characterisation of
<em>prima facie</em> duties&mdash;roughly, moral reasons&mdash;as
features that make an action obligatory in the absence of conflicting
duties (1939: 19; for discussion see Dancy 2004: 18&ndash;20)). The
most prominent contemporary version of the view is due to John Broome
(2013: ch. 4). Broome begins with the idea that a reason is an
explanation of why you ought to do something. However, this seems not
to allow that reasons can be defeated (though see Nebel 2019). Broome
thus introduces the idea of a &ldquo;weighing explanation&rdquo;: an
explanation of an act&rsquo;s deontic status that appeals to
considerations for or against the action. Broome proposes that a
reason to act is a consideration that plays the &ldquo;for&rdquo; role
in such an explanation (2013: 53; for discussion see Brunero 2013,
2019).</p>

<p>
The second group of views aims to characterise normative reasons in
terms of their deliberative role: to be a reason is to be a fact that
it is appropriate to consider in deliberation, or on the basis of
which it is right to decide what to do. Bernard Williams can be read
as endorsing such a view in proposing that a subject has a reason to
act only if he could reach the conclusion to so act &ldquo;by a sound
deliberative route from the motivations he already has&rdquo; (1989:
35, see also Williams 1979). Although Williams developed this idea in
a broadly &ldquo;Humean&rdquo; way (see below), the core idea of
understanding normative reasons in terms of their deliberative role is
independent of these commitments. For instance, one may hold that a
reason is a fact you would be motivated by in so far as you are
rational (Korsgaard 1986), or one for which your rational counterpart
would want you to act (Smith 1994; Manne 2014) or a premise of good
reasoning (Setiya 2014; Way 2017; McHugh &amp; Way 2022). For further
variants, see, e.g., Street 2008; Markovits 2014). Kearns and
Star&rsquo;s (2008, 2009) proposal that a reason to act is evidence
that you ought to so act can also be understood in this way, if we
take practical deliberation to aim to figure out what you ought to do
(Star 2015, 2018a; see also Raz 1978: 5ff; Whiting 2021: ch.2).</p>

<p>
A third group of views understands normative reasons in terms of a
relation between reasons and certain types of <em>ends</em>.
&ldquo;Desire-based&rdquo; versions of this view, which take
inspiration from Hume&rsquo;s remarks about reason and the passions,
take the relevant ends to be the intentional objects of desires. On a
simple desire-based view, a reason for you to act is a fact that helps
explain why acting that way would achieve something you desire. For
instance, the fact that there will be dancing at the party is a reason
for Ronnie to go to the party, because it helps explain why going to
the party will help Ronnie to do something he wants to
do&mdash;namely, dancing (Schroeder 2007; see also Williams 1979,
1989; Alan Goldman 2009; Markovits 2014; Manne 2014, 2016).
&ldquo;Value-based&rdquo; versions understand reasons in terms of a
relation to good, or valuable, ends. This view is associated with
Aristotle who links the right in practical reason with what is
conducive to the good (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>) and was prevalent
among medieval philosophers (e.g., Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa
Theologiae</em>, 1a, q.82). A simple formulation takes reasons to be
facts that explain why acting in a certain way would achieve some
valuable end (Finlay 2014; Maguire 2016). Other versions invoke other
relations to the valuable, such as respect for it (see also Anderson
1993; Raz 1999, 2001, 2011; Wedgwood 2017; Sylvan 2021. For a recent
discussion see Kiesewetter 2022).</p>

<p>
These different approaches to characterising normative reasons can be
assessed in various ways: for instance, with reference to how well
they accommodate the deontic and deliberative roles of normative
reasons; or to their implications concerning what reasons we have in
particular cases. Each approach faces challenges on these and other
fronts, some of which are outlined below.</p>

<p>
One very general issue worth noting is that an account of &ldquo;the
reason relation&rdquo; should arguably be general: it should apply not
just to reasons to act but also to reasons to believe, want, and feel
(e.g., Kearns &amp; Star 2009: 219&ndash;22; Gibbons 2010; Way 2017:
255). There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a difference in the
<em>relation</em> we are invoking when we say, for instance, that the
fact that there&rsquo;s going to be an election is a reason both to
register to vote and to fear things are going to get worse. Rather,
one fact stands in the same relation&mdash;of favouring or
supporting&mdash;to both an action and an emotion. So, the different
accounts should be assessed according to how plausible they are, not
just as accounts of reasons to act, but of reasons for these other
types of response too.</p>

<h3 id="NorReaMorMetDel">2.3 Normative Reasons, Morality, Metaethics and Deliberation</h3>

<p>
However we characterise normative reasons, they raise a host of
interesting and important issues, which intersect with other areas of
practical philosophy. This section will briefly outline three such
issues, and then say a little more about a fourth.</p>

<p>
First, there are questions about the relationship between reasons and
morality. A traditionally central question is whether we all have good
reason to do as morality requires. This question is especially
pressing for desire-based accounts of reasons and for certain versions
of the view that reasons should be understood in terms of their
deliberative role. For it certainly seems possible that doing what
morality requires may not serve any desire a person has and may not be
anything to which there is &ldquo;a sound deliberative route from the
motivations he already has&rdquo; (Williams 1989:35; see entry on
 <a href="../reasons-internal-external/">reasons for action: internal vs. external</a>).
 Beyond this issue, there are important questions about what, if
anything, is distinctive about moral reasons (see, e.g., Scanlon 1998;
Darwall 2006; Southwood 2011). And there are questions about whether
the theory of normative reasons has any implications for normative
ethics (see, e.g., entry on
 <a href="../moral-particularism-generalism/">moral particularism and moral generalism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Second, there are questions that intersect with discussions in
metaethics about how normativity fits with the non-normative world.
For instance, can the relation of being a normative reason be analysed
in naturalistic or descriptive terms? Do normative reasons depend on
us in some way? Are judgements about reasons even in the business of
ascribing properties at all? While questions of this sort have
traditionally been raised about moral properties&mdash;e.g., moral
rightness and wrongness&mdash;many recent philosophers have come to
see them as general questions about normative facts. Accordingly, much
recent metaethical work has focused not on morality but on
normativity, and sometimes on normative reasons in particular (see
entry on
 <a href="../normativity-metaethics/">normativity in metaethics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Third, there are questions about how normative reasons play their
deliberative role, such as: What makes for good deliberation, or
reasoning? What is involved in responding to a normative reason? What
kinds of evaluations turn on the normative reasons we act for? These
questions take us into moral psychology and action theory. Some of
them are explored in
 <a href="#MotExpRea">section 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#RelBetNorMotRea">section 4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Fourth, there are questions about how normative reasons play their
deontic role, that intersect with questions in normative ethics. How
do the various reasons for and against a course of action combine to
determine whether someone ought or may undertake it? A simple proposal
is that whether someone ought to act in a certain way depends on how
all the reasons for and against so acting weigh up in comparison to
all the reasons for and against the alternatives (see, e.g., Berker
2007; Schroeder 2007). But this already raises a host of
questions.</p>

<p>
To begin with, is it really the case that <em>all</em> the reasons
bearing on an act are relevant to determining its deontic status?
Above we said that normative reasons are facts. The combination of
these two ideas leads to some surprising results. Suppose, to take a
well-known example of Judith Thomson&rsquo;s (1990: 299), that due to
an extraordinary and unforeseeable coincidence, flipping the light
switch when you get home will cause a small lightning flash in your
neighbour&rsquo;s home, badly burning them. This fact seems to
strongly count against flipping the switch. So, all else being equal,
you ought not flip the switch. However, since the harm to your
neighbour is entirely unforeseeable, many people (though notably, not
Thomson; see also Graham 2011) find this conclusion hard to
accept.</p>

<p>
In light of such concerns, some philosophers endorse an epistemic
constraint, either on normative reasons (Dancy 2000: 56&ndash;9;
Kiesewetter 2017; Markovits 2010: 219), or on the reasons relevant to
deontic status (Setiya 2014; Lord 2018). On this
&ldquo;perspectivist&rdquo; view, a fact must fall within your
epistemic perspective&mdash;you must know it, or perhaps be in a
position to know it, or reasonably believe it, etc.&mdash;if it is to
bear on what you ought to do. Others distinguish between types of
deontic status. In Thomson&rsquo;s example, it seems plausible that,
relative to all the facts, you ought to refrain from flipping the
switch; but, relative to the facts you know, or to your beliefs, you
may flip the switch. These different verdicts play different roles in
our thought and practices: for instance, what we ought to do relative
to all the facts may be what we aim to discover through deliberation
and advice, while what someone ought to do relative to what they know,
or perhaps believe, is more closely tied to assessments of
rationality, and merit and culpability (Schroeder 2008). Given these
distinctions, the deontic role that reasons play should be refined:
<em>objective</em> reasons determine deontic status in the former
contexts, while <em>subjective</em> reasons determine it in the second
(Schroeder 2007; Parfit 2011; Fogal &amp; Worsnip 2021).</p>

<p>
However, these issues are settled, reasons&rsquo; deontic role raises
further, more fundamental, questions. How exactly do the relevant
reasons determine deontic status? In many cases, it is natural to
appeal to metaphors of weight and strength: my reasons to complete my
report are stronger than my reasons to take the day off and enjoy the
sunshine, so I ought to keep working. The amusement the joke will
bring is outweighed by the embarrassment it will cause, and so I ought
not tell the joke. What should we make of these metaphors? They seem
to have limitations. For instance, reasons are claimed not to combine
in a simple additive way, or to vary with context, or to be sometimes
incomparable (see, e.g., Dancy 2004, 2018; Bader 2016; Cullity 2018;
and the entry on
 <a href="../value-incommensurable/">incommensurable values</a>).
 An important question is thus how an account of reasons&rsquo;
weights can make sense of those observations (Schroeder 2007: ch.7;
Horty 2012; Nair 2021; McHugh &amp; Way 2022: ch.5).</p>

<p>
Another worry is that the metaphor of weight and strength is
inappropriate in portraying the relation between some reasons. For
instance, a longstanding idea is that some moral reasons&mdash;say,
that so acting would be taking an innocent
life&mdash;&ldquo;silence&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;outweigh&rdquo;
competing reasons (McDowell 1978; for a related idea see Raz 1975,
1989, and Raz 2021 on &ldquo;exclusionary reasons&rdquo; in the Other
Internet Resources). More generally, it is not clear how the proposal
encompasses the full range of considerations that can bear on deontic
status&mdash;for instance, obligations to others, rights, commitments,
ideals. Finally, the proposal builds in &ldquo;maximisation&rdquo;: we
ought to follow the weightiest reasons. But very often it seems okay
to do less than the best&mdash;for example, when the best would be
supererogatory, or an alternative would be good enough. Nor is it
clear how to accommodate a distinction between what we ought to do and
what we must do. Such concerns have led some to refine the simple
proposal, or pursue alternatives (Raz 1986; Gert 2004, 2007; McElwee
2011; Lord &amp; Maguire 2016a; Snedegar 2016, 2018; Maguire &amp;
Snedegar 2021; Tucker 2022; Whiting 2021: ch. 3).</p>

<h2 id="MotExpRea">3. Motivating (and Explanatory) Reasons</h2>

<p>
Motivating reasons are the reasons for which we act&mdash;the reasons
that motivate us. Motivating reasons can thereby explain our actions.
However, motivating reasons should not simply be equated with the
reasons that explain our actions.</p>

<p>
Consider the behaviour of Othello in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play of the
same name. Othello kills Desdemona guided by the belief, induced by
jealous Iago, that she has been unfaithful to him. The tragedy of the
play lies in the fact that Desdemona is innocent: she loves Othello
and is faithful to him. Clearly&mdash;and putting aside whether
infidelity could ever favour murder&mdash;there is in <em>Othello</em>
no reason that favours the murder: no normative reason for Othello to
kill Desdemona, since she is not unfaithful. Still, there are two
things that seem true about Othello&rsquo;s killing of Desdemona. One
is that he is motivated to kill Desdemona by the (putative) fact that
she has been unfaithful. The other is that his action can be explained
by citing the fact that he believes that Desdemona has been
unfaithful. So here we seem to have two quite different reasons: one
that motivates Othello&mdash;the (putative) fact that Desdemona has
been unfaithful; and one that explains his action&mdash;the (actual)
fact that <em>he believes</em> that she has been unfaithful. We can
distinguish, that is, between the reason that explains Othello&rsquo;s
action (the fact that he believes that Desdemona has been unfaithful)
and the reason, or apparent reason, that motivates him to act
(Desdemona&rsquo;s alleged infidelity itself).</p>

<p>
Accordingly, we should distinguish in general (at least) three kinds
of reasons: normative, motivating and explanatory, corresponding to
whether a reason favours, motivates, or explains an action. This sits
well with the suggestion (in
 <a href="#VarPraRea">section 1</a>)
 that the distinction between normative and motivating reasons is
drawn on the basis of the different questions that reasons can answer.
For there seem to be at least three distinct questions about the
relation between reasons and actions. There are questions about
whether there is a reason that favours someone&rsquo;s action
(normative); questions about the considerations&mdash;(putative)
facts&mdash;in light of which someone act (motivating); and also
questions about what reasons explain an action (explanatory). This
threefold classification is explicitly accepted and defended by
various authors (Baier 1958; Alvarez 2007, 2009, 2010; Hieronymi
2011); and it is implicit, sometimes using different terminology, in
discussions by others (Smith 1994; Scanlon 1998; Mantel 2014).</p>

<p>
This use of &ldquo;the motivating reason&rdquo; for the consideration
&ldquo;in light of which&rdquo; someone acts is of course somewhat
stipulative.</p>

<p>
First, talk of &ldquo;the agent&rsquo;s motivating reason&rdquo;
typically involves some simplification. For one thing, a consideration
in light of which one acts will figure in deliberation in combination
with other considerations. For example, that I won&rsquo;t have time
to hoover later may motivate me to hoover early in the morning only in
combination with other considerations, for instance, that the house
needs hoovering today. My reason then is, arguably, a combination of
at least two considerations: that the house needs hoovering today and
that I won&rsquo;t be able to do it later. This point is relevant to
questions about the relation between normative and motivating reasons
(see
 <a href="#RelBetNorMotRea">section 4</a>).
 Moreover, an agent may be motivated to act by more than one
consideration in a different sense: I may hoover the house early in
the morning both because I won&rsquo;t have time to do it later
<em>and also</em> because it will annoy my inconsiderate neighbour.
Alternatively, I might take myself to have those two reasons to hoover
early but act motivated only by one of them (this point is central to
Davidson&rsquo;s (1963) influential argument that motivating reasons
are causes of intentional actions). Finally, I may consider something
that counts against acting, for instance, that hoovering early will
also disturb my other, very considerate neighbour. If I still decide
to hoover early, I do not act for that &ldquo;con reason&rdquo; but,
arguably, I am still guided by it in some sense, if I give it some
weight in my deliberation (Ruben 2009).</p>

<p>
Talk of motivating reasons is stipulative also in excluding some
things that might reasonably be assumed to be motivating reasons. For
instance, someone&rsquo;s goal or intention in acting (to grow
vegetables, to become rich) are motivating factors but, because they
are not considerations in light of which one acts, do not fall under
the category &ldquo;motivating reasons&rdquo; as here understood (but
see Audi 1993; Howard 2021). Similarly, a state of desiring (such as
wanting to have one&rsquo;s revenge), or a motive or emotion (for
instance, jealousy) can be states &ldquo;that encompass
motivation&rdquo;, to use Mele&rsquo;s phrase (2003). Nevertheless,
they are not motivating reasons as understood here. Rather, the
considerations (if any) in response to which the person desires, or
feels the emotion, will thereby be the person&rsquo;s motivating
reasons. To continue with our example, Othello&rsquo;s jealousy and
desire to kill Desdemona is based on the thought that she is
unfaithful to him. This consideration is Othello&rsquo;s reason both
for wanting to kill her and his reason for doing so.</p>

<p>
But what exactly is a motivating reason, thus understood? What kind of
entities can be considerations in light of which someone acts? And
what kind of relation must hold between an agent and an entity of the
relevant kind for it to be the reason for which she acts?
 <a href="#OntMotRea">Section 3.1</a>
 addresses the former question, while
 <a href="#ActForMotRea">section 3.2</a>
 examines the latter.</p>

<h3 id="OntMotRea">3.1 The Ontology of Motivating Reasons</h3>

<p>
In the literature on the theory of action until the turn of the
twentieth century, the dominant view was that motivating reasons are
mental states of the agent&rsquo;s&mdash;a view sometimes called
&ldquo;psychologism&rdquo;. Davidson 1963 is often cited as the
<em>locus classicus</em> of psychologism, and the view was also
influentially defended in Smith 1994: ch. 4; see also Wallace 2003,
Pryor 2007, Turri 2009, Gibbons 2010. Davidson characterises an
intentional action as an event&mdash;a bodily movement&mdash;caused
&ldquo;in the right way&rdquo; by a combination of two mental states:
a &ldquo;pro-attitude&rdquo; (roughly, a desire) and a belief.
Davidson called this combination of mental states the agent&rsquo;s
&ldquo;primary reason&rdquo; (1963: 687).</p>

<p>
Psychologism is appealing. First, when an agent acts for a reason, he
acts motivated by some end towards which he has a pro-attitude and
guided by a belief about how to achieve that end. To return to our
example, Othello murdered Desdemona motivated by the desire to defend
his honour and guided by his belief that the latter demanded
Desdemona&rsquo;s death, given her unfaithfulness. Second, for a
reason to motivate, you must have the right sort of &ldquo;epistemic
contact&rdquo; with that reason: you must know or believe the
consideration that constitutes that reason. Both these points appear
to support the view that the reasons that motivate are agents&rsquo;
mental states.</p>

<p>
However, these arguments don&rsquo;t suffice to establish
psychologism. In fact, there are forceful arguments against the
position. A simple point, highlighted in the Othello example, is that
reflection on the considerations that agents take as reasons for
acting, and on what they typically give and accept as their reasons,
counts against psychologism. As Othello deliberates about what to do,
even while in the grip of jealousy, his reasoning does not include
considerations about whether he believes this or that but rather about
what Desdemona has or has not done. The things that Othello considers
and responds to are not his mental states but rather facts, or alleged
facts, about the world around him, in particular about Desdemona.</p>

<p>
Another important argument turns on the idea that any account of
motivating reasons must meet what Dancy (1995; 2000) calls &ldquo;the
normative constraint&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This [normative constraint] requires that a motivating reason, that in
the light of which one acts, must be the sort of thing that is capable
of being among the reasons in favour of so acting; it must, in this
sense, be possible to act for a good reason (2000: 103; see also Raz
2011: 27).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dancy&rsquo;s point is that psychologism fails to meet this
constraint&mdash;in fact, he says, psychologism has the consequence
that &ldquo;the reasons why we act can never be among the reasons in
favour of acting&rdquo; (2000: 105). Why? In order to act for a good
reason (in Dancy&rsquo;s sense), we need to act for a reason that is
or could be a fact&mdash;for Dancy, something that is or could be the
case. But psychologism does not meet this constraint because a mental
state is not, not could it be, a fact. In short, Dancy thinks that you
act for a good reason only if your motivating reason is a normative
reason that favours your action, or it is at least a consideration
which, if true, would or could favour it (see Heuer 2004 for a helpful
explanation).</p>

<p>
A variant of psychologism avoids this objection by claiming that
motivating reasons are &ldquo;psychological facts&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, facts about the agent&rsquo;s mental states. For instance, on this
view, Jo&rsquo;s reason for running is the (psychological) fact that
she believes that she&rsquo;s late. This position appears to meet
Dancy&rsquo;s constraint, at least formally: psychological facts
<em>are</em> facts. But the view is unsatisfactory because, although
we are occasionally motivated by facts about our psychology&mdash;as
when someone decides to see his doctor because he is convinced
he&rsquo;s being pursued by the Security Services (Hyman
1999)&mdash;most motivating reasons are not psychological facts: they
are (putative) facts about all sorts of things.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, it may be argued that psychologism meets Dancy&rsquo;s
normative constraint because it holds that motivating reasons are
mental states whose <em>contents correspond</em> to normative reasons.
It is a mistake to assume that meeting the constraint requires the
identity of normative and motivating reasons (Mantel 2014).</p>

<p>
To determine the success of this response we need to disambiguate it.
On the one hand, the response can be taken to argue that the reasons
that motivate us are the <em>contents</em> of our mental states of
believing. This meets the normative constraint (on this view, one
<em>can</em> act for a good reason) but this does not vindicate
psychologism because the contents of mental states are not themselves
mental states: they may be propositions, or facts, etc. If, by
contrast, the response is construed as simply asserting that a mental
state with the right content can be a good reason for acting (in
Dancy&rsquo;s sense), then it is not clear how this engages with
Dancy&rsquo;s objection.</p>

<p>
The above and other arguments (see, e.g., Stout 1996; Stoutland 1998;
Hyman 1999, 2015; Raz 1999; Dancy 2000, 2008; Williamson 2000; Bittner
2001; Schueler 2003; Hornsby 2007, 2008; Alvarez 2008, 2009, 2010;
McDowell 2013) suggest that being motivated by a reason is not being
motivated by, or acting in light of, or guided by, a mental state.
Accordingly, psychologism is now a minority view.</p>

<p>
There are currently two main alternatives to psychologism:
&ldquo;factualism&rdquo; (motivating reasons are facts) and
&ldquo;propositionalism&rdquo; (motivating reasons are true or false
propositions).</p>

<p>
Each face difficulties. For factualism, a central problem concerns
&ldquo;error cases&rdquo;: cases like Othello&rsquo;s, where the agent
is motivated to act by a false consideration. In the example what
motivated Othello, what he would give as his reason&mdash;that
Desdemona has been unfaithful&mdash;is false. And so, Othello cannot
act in light of the fact that Desdemona has been unfaithful since
there is no such fact. A possible response is that, in error cases,
the agent is motivated by something that he treats as a reason but
which is in fact merely an &ldquo;apparent reason&rdquo; (Alvarez
2010).</p>

<p>
Propositionalism, it seems, <em>can</em> accommodate this problem: in
error cases, the positions holds, agents act for a reason that is a
false proposition that the agent believes. So, in the example above,
Othello&rsquo;s reason is the (false) proposition about Desdemona,
which he believes. Note his motivating reason is not <em>his
believing</em> that she&rsquo;s unfaithful, which would bring us back
to psychologism, but <em>what</em> he believes. According to this
proposal, then, Othello did act for a reason: a putative fact that the
agent takes to obtain. The view is defended or endorsed by many,
including Dancy (2000, 2008, 2014), Hornsby (2007, 2008), Setiya
(2007), Schroeder (2008), McDowell (2013), Comesa&ntilde;a &amp;
McGrath (2014), and Singh (2019).</p>

<p>
Against this, it has been argued that the proposal leads to paradox or
infelicitous claims. As Unger puts the point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is inconsistent to say &ldquo;His reason was that the store was
going to close, but it wasn&rsquo;t going to close&rdquo;. (1975:
208)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If so, the response that in error cases the agent&rsquo;s reason is a
false proposition is problematic.</p>

<p>
But is this anything other than a terminological dispute? After all,
if some philosophers choose to call false propositions that motivate
&ldquo;motivating reasons&rdquo;, while others choose to call them
&ldquo;apparent reasons&rdquo;, that seems perfectly unobjectionable.
The substantial issue behind this disagreement seems, then, whether
the notion of a reason we apply in different contexts is a unified
notion; and, if it is, what aspect or features of reasons, if any, are
essential or central to that notion&mdash;for instance, that they can
determine deontic status, that they can explain (all sorts of things),
or that they can be used in reasoning. If the former two are taken to
be central, then it follows that a false proposition cannot be a
reason. In contrast, the view that the central feature of reasons is
that they can be premises of reasoning allows for more latitude so as
to include false propositions as reasons.</p>

<h3 id="ActForMotRea">3.2 Acting for a Motivating Reason</h3>

<p>
Motivating reasons are considerations in light of which we act.
However we conceive of them ontologically, there are issues about what
it takes for an agent to act for a motivating reason.</p>

<h4 id="KnowOnesReas">3.2.1 Knowing one&rsquo;s reason</h4>

<p>
Most accounts of acting for a motivating reason require as a condition
that the agent be in some kind of epistemic relation to the reason
that motivates her. One view is that this epistemic relation is
belief: for an agent to act for the reason that <em>p</em>, the agent
must at least believe that <em>p</em>. It is this thought that led
some to psychologism.</p>

<p>
More recently, some have argued that, at least when someone acts for a
reason that is also a fact, the agent needs to <em>know</em> and not
merely believe the relevant fact, if they are to act in light of it.
The view is defended by Unger (1975), Hyman (1999, 2011, 2015),
Williamson (2000, 2017), Hornsby (2007, 2008), and McDowell (2013).
The basic thought is that, if the agent does not know the fact, she
cannot be guided by it (Hyman), or respond rationally to it
(McDowell). The relationship between the agent&rsquo;s acting as she
does and the relevant fact will be fortuitous, a matter of luck or
coincidence. To illustrate, suppose someone believes on a hunch that
Pegasus will win the Grand National, and so places a large bet. Even
if Pegasus does win, the person was not guided by the fact that
Pegasus will win; they just got lucky (Hyman 1999: 447). The same may
be true when an agent acts on a belief that is both true and
justified. Suppose someone believes that it is 5pm because they glance
at what&mdash;unbeknownst to them&mdash;is a stopped clock, and so
leave for their appointment. Even though it actually is 5pm, they are
not guided by this fact&mdash;they just got lucky. (This point extends
Gettier&rsquo;s (1963) famous arguments that justified true belief is
not sufficient for knowledge; see entry on
 <a href="../knowledge-analysis/#GettProb">the analysis of knowledge</a>).</p>
 
<p>
These arguments remain contentious. For example, Dustin Locke (2015)
uses so-called &ldquo;fake-barn&rdquo; cases to argue that we can act
in light of a fact without knowing it. Suppose a man is driving in the
countryside and sees a (real) barn ahead. Unbeknown to him, he&rsquo;s
driving in &ldquo;fake-barn country&rdquo;, which is littered with
fake barns: barn fa&ccedil;ades designed to look like real barns. It
is widely held that, although the man is looking at a real barn, he
does not know that it&rsquo;s a barn (Alvin Goldman 1967).
Nonetheless, Locke argues, he might, for instance, drive towards the
barn guided by the fact that it&rsquo;s a barn. Thus, being guided by
a fact does not require knowing it. For further views and discussion,
see Hawthorne 2004; Brown 2008; Neta 2009; Dancy 2011, 2014; Lord
2018; Hawthorne &amp; Magidor 2018, Whiting 2021: ch.5.</p>

<h4 id="TakiConsReas">3.2.2 Taking considerations as reasons: the guise of reasons</h4>

<p>
As we have seen, motivating reasons need not be normative reasons: we
don&rsquo;t always act for good reasons. However, an influential and
attractive view is that they must be <em>taken</em> to be normative
reasons. As Davidson (1963) puts it, when an agent acts for a
motivating reason then &ldquo;from the agent&rsquo;s point of view
there was, when he acted, something to be said for the action&rdquo;
(1963: 691; see also Darwall 1983: 32; Scanlon 1998: 23). The view is
a relative of the ancient idea that all action takes place
&ldquo;under the guise of the good&rdquo;&mdash;that whenever we act
intentionally, we take what we are doing to be in some way good. This
view is defended by Anscombe (1957), Stampe (1987), Quinn (1993), Raz
(1999), Schueler (2003), and Oddie (2005), amongst others. Indeed, if
we assume that taking there to be a normative reason to act involves
taking acting in that way to be good, the view embraces the guise of
the good thesis. Nonetheless, this assumption may be questioned and
some claim that a &ldquo;guise of reasons&rdquo; view that does
without it has advantages over the guise of the good (Gregory
2021).</p>

<p>
There are important questions about how exactly these views are to be
understood. For instance, what is it to &ldquo;take&rdquo; a
consideration to be a normative reason? On one natural view, to take a
consideration to be a normative reason is just to <em>believe</em>
that it is a normative reason (Gregory 2021). Another view is that
taking a consideration to be a reason is a quasi-perceptual state of
that consideration&rsquo;s <em>seeming</em> to be a reason (compare
Stampe 1987; Oddie 2005; Tenenbaum 2007; Moss 2012), and yet other
contenders have emerged in the recent literature (Tenenbaum 2008;
Schafer 2013; Singh 2019).</p>

<p>
Much of the debate concerning the guise of reasons and the guise of
the good has focused on putative counterexamples&mdash;cases in which,
it is claimed, someone acts intentionally or for a reason without
taking any consideration to count in favour of what they are doing. To
take a few representative examples, some claim that negative emotions
such an anger or frustration might lead us to do what we recognise to
be in no way good, as when someone shouts at or destroys an
&ldquo;uncooperative&rdquo; household appliance (Stocker 1979;
Hursthouse 1991). Others claim that we can be motivated to act in ways
we take to be entirely bad, and indeed be so motivated
<em>precisely</em> because we take the action to be bad&mdash;as when
Milton&rsquo;s Satan declares &ldquo;evil be thou my good&rdquo;
(Velleman 1992). And others suggest that animals and young children
might act for reasons, while lacking the conceptual sophistication to
represent their actions as good. Various responses have been offered
to these examples. For instance, some take cases of negative emotions
to undermine the view that we act only in ways we <em>believe</em> to
be good, but not the view that we act only in ways that, at the time,
<em>appear</em> good (Tenenbaum 2007). Others emphasise the varieties
of ways in which something can be good, or a reason&mdash;thus for
instance, while Milton&rsquo;s Satan might be motivated by what he
takes to be <em>morally</em> bad, he may still do what he takes to be
good in other ways (Anscombe 1957; Tenenbaum 2007). And there has been
much debate on &ldquo;expressive actions&rdquo;, for example, on
whether actions done out of strong emotions are intentional or done
for reasons (see Bennett 2021 for an overview).</p>

<p>
Since arguments by counterexample are often inconclusive, recent
discussions have focused more on what role the guise of reasons, or
the guise of the good, might play in a satisfying account of what it
is to act for reasons. Thus Setiya (2007) argues against these theses
on the grounds that they play no role: he claims that the central task
for an account of what it is to act for reasons is to explain our
distinctive knowledge of our own actions, and that this can be
provided without any appeal to the guise of reasons, or the good.
However, many other theorists have thought that there are indeed
principled reasons for action theory to accept one of these theses.
Perhaps the most important argument appeals to the idea that, in
stating an agent&rsquo;s motivating reasons, one shows the
agent&rsquo;s action to be intelligible in a distinctive way&mdash;a
way characteristic of rational creatures. Proponents of this argument
suggest that explanations of agent&rsquo;s actions which don&rsquo;t
reveal the way the agent took so acting to be good, or supported by
reasons, fail to do this. To adapt a famous example of Warren
Quinn&rsquo;s, someone who turns on a radio because of a brute
disposition to do so, without seeing anything to be said for doing so,
seems not to be acting for a reason. Articulations of this idea in the
service of the guise of reasons, or the good, can be found in Anscombe
1957; Davidson 1963; Quinn 1993; Scanlon 1998; for recent developments
and discussions, see Copp and Sobel 2002; Gert 2003: ch.9; Schapiro

<h2 id="RelBetNorMotRea">4. The Relationship between Normative and Motivating Reasons</h2>

<p>
This section discusses some of the many interesting issues about how
normative and motivating reasons relate to each other. One cluster of
questions
 (<a href="#NorReaGui">section 4.1</a>)
 centres on the guiding role of normative reasons. A second
 (<a href="#ActForNorRea">section 4.2</a>)
 focuses on what it is to act for normative reasons, and the
significance of doing so.</p>

<h3 id="NorReaGui">4.1 Normative Reasons and Guidance</h3>

<p>
An attractive and popular idea is that normative reasons are supposed
to guide us, in deliberation and in action. That is what normative
reasons seem to be <em>for</em>. But how should we spell out this
thought? One way is normative: a reason is a fact that we ought to be
moved by, or that it is rational, or appropriate, or good reasoning,
to be moved by. This might be called the &ldquo;deliberative
condition&rdquo; on normative reasons. Another way is descriptive:
normative reasons must be facts by which you can be moved: they must
be potential motivating reasons. Call this the &ldquo;ability
condition&rdquo; on normative reasons. Often these ideas are combined:
normative reasons must be facts that you are able to be moved by
through sound deliberation, or in so far as you are rational (Nagel
1970; Williams 1979, 1989; Korsgaard 1986; Smith 1994). Call this the
&ldquo;combined&rdquo; condition.</p>

<p>
We might ask which of these conditions, suitably refined, best
captures the initial thought, or is most plausible on reflection.
Rather than engage with this directly, this section will illustrate
how the differences between them matter by looking at ways in which
the three versions have been put to work. Since the deliberative
condition has been discussed in
 <a href="#NorRea">section 2</a>,
 this section will mostly focus on the ability and on the combined
conditions.</p>

<p>
The most famous appeal to the combined condition is found in
Williams&rsquo; (1979, 1989) case for a broadly Humean view of
normative reasons&mdash;at least on one common reading of that much
contested argument (see entry on
 <a href="../reasons-internal-external/">reasons for action: internal vs. external</a>).
 As noted in
 <a href="#NorRea">section 2</a>,
 Williams claims that we have reason to do only what we could be
motivated to do via a sound deliberative route. Since Williams also
finds it plausible that what we can be so motivated to do will vary
with our desires (broadly construed), he concludes that our normative
reasons will also vary accordingly. One problem with this argument is
that whether sound deliberation exhibits this relativity depends on
what exactly sound deliberation involves (Korsgaard 1986; Hooker
1987). Some Kantians hold that sound deliberation will lead anyone,
whatever their motivations, to the same conclusions&mdash;in
particular, to do what is morally right (Smith 1994; Korsgaard 1996;
Markovits 2014). Williams (1989) concedes this point, while noting
that the burden is on Kantians to make their case. In so far as one is
unpersuaded by Kantian efforts, Williams&rsquo; argument may thus
retain some force.</p>

<p>
The ability condition is often appealed to in support of an epistemic
constraints on normative reasons, or perspectivism about what we ought
to do. The basic idea is that a normative reason must fall within an
agent&rsquo;s epistemic perspective (e.g., they must know it or be in
a position to; see
 <a href="#NorRea">section 2</a>),
 if they are to be able to be moved by it. This argument turns on a
fairly strong interpretation of the ability condition. In one sense, I
am able to be moved by a reason if I might be motivated by it, were I
to become aware of it. In another sense, I am not able to be moved by
a reason if I am not right now aware of it. Compare: in one sense, I
am able to drive, as I sit here typing in my office; in another sense,
I am not able to do so, since my car is several miles away. The first
sense depends only on my having the ability to drive; the second on my
also having the opportunity (what J.L. Austin (1956) called the
&ldquo;all-in sense of &lsquo;can&rsquo;&rdquo;). The argument for
perspectivism requires that we understand the ability condition in the
more demanding sense. It is unclear whether this version of the
condition is well-motivated (for discussion see Way &amp; Whiting
2016; Lord 2018: ch. 8).</p>

<p>
A version of the ability condition features in Dancy&rsquo;s
influential argument against psychologism about motivating reasons. As
discussed in
 <a href="#OntMotRea">section 3.1</a>,
 Dancy claims that since it must be possible to act for a good reason,
motivating reasons must be of the same ontological category as
normative reasons&mdash;they must be facts, or putative facts. This
argument requires only a very weak version of the ability condition,
since it involves no commitments about the conditions under which
normative reasons might actually motivate us.</p>

<p>
These examples illustrate some of the different ways in which the
initial attractive idea&mdash;that normative reasons are supposed to
guide us&mdash;can be elaborated, and how those differences might
matter. Some philosophers, however, reject all forms of this idea.
This is largely because of putative examples of &ldquo;elusive&rdquo;
or &ldquo;self-effacing&rdquo; reasons: roughly, normative reasons
that would not survive if you were to respond to them. The most
familiar example is that of Nate, who loves successful surprise
parties but hates unsuccessful surprise parties (Schroeder 2007: 33;
165&ndash;66). If there is a surprise party waiting for Nate at home,
then that seems a reason for Nate to go home. After all, an informed
friend might advise Nate to go home by saying, &ldquo;although I
can&rsquo;t tell you what it is, there&rsquo;s a very good reason for
you to do so!&rdquo; But Nate cannot go home for the reason that
there&rsquo;s a surprise party there; this would require him to be
aware that there&rsquo;s a surprise party, which would spoil the
surprise, and thus undermine the reason. That there&rsquo;s a surprise
party waiting for Nate thus seems to be a normative reason that is not
a potential motivating reason. <em>A fortiori</em>, it is not a reason
he could be motivated by through sound deliberation. (For other
examples and references, see McKeever &amp; Ridge 2012; Markovits
2014; Way &amp; Whiting 2016; Rossi 2021).</p>

<p>
There are other putative counterexamples to these conditions which are
not based on self-effacing reasons. Julia Markovits (2011: 48)
describes the case of Captain Sullenberger, who successfully, and
without any loss of life, emergency-landed an Airbus 320 that had lost
all thrust in its engines. Sullenberger said afterwards that he was
not thinking of the potential loss of life and suggested that it would
have been a distraction to do so. Of course, the threat to life was a
normative reason for him to act as he did but, it might seem, not one
it made sense for him to deliberate in terms of.</p>

<p>
The most common response to these objections is to deny that such
counterexamples are genuine. For example, even if the surprise party
waiting for Nate is not a reason for him to go home, it might
nonetheless make it <em>good</em> for him to go home, be a reason for
others to encourage him to do so, a reason for him later to regret not
doing so, etc. Moreover, related considerations, such as that Nate
would enjoy going home, might be reasons for him to go home. For some,
these observations suffice to capture our intuitions about the case
(Kiesewetter 2016: 769&ndash;71; Paakkunainen 2017: 68&ndash;70).
Others hold that the cases call for particular interpretations of the
ability and combined conditions. For instance, perhaps Nate can be
motivated by the surprise party in so far as he can go home on account
of his discreet but better-informed friend&rsquo;s advice (McKeever
&amp; Ridge 2012; Sinclair 2016; for alternative interpretations see
Smith 1994; Way &amp; Whiting 2016; for discussion see Rossi
2021).</p>

<p>
Debate over these questions goes on. And while it can be tempting to
dismiss such examples as artificial or peripheral, they may have
significant implications. For example, some take them to underscore
the need to sharply distinguish the deontic and deliberative roles,
concluding that there is no unified concept of a normative reason that
can play both roles (Wedgwood 2015).</p>

<h3 id="ActForNorRea">4.2 Acting for a Normative Reason</h3>

<p>
Regardless of whether all normative reasons must be potential
motivating reasons, we do sometimes act for normative reasons. What is
involved in this? What does it take to act for a normative reason?</p>

<p>
The answer might seem straightforward. Dancy writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[i]n the best case, there is some good reason for doing the action,
and the reason that motivates the agent coincides with that reason.
(2000: 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This suggests that when the fact that <em>p</em> is a normative reason
for you to act in a certain way, you act for that reason when you act
in that way and your motivating reason for doing so is the fact that
<em>p</em>. However, even if we allow ourselves the notion of an
action motivated by the fact that <em>p</em>&mdash;see
 <a href="#ActForMotRea">section 3.2</a>&mdash;there
 are further complications.</p>

<p>
Consider: the house is on fire and a child is trapped inside. This is
a normative reason to run inside and help the child escape: the
child&rsquo;s life matters and you can save it. Suppose that you do
run inside and that your motivating reason is that you can help the
child escape the fire. But suppose you are so motivated not because
you are concerned for the child, but because you expect praise and
reward for your action. Do you then act <em>for the reason</em> that
the child is trapped inside the house? In a sense you do, since you
run in to help the child escape. But, in an important sense, you
don&rsquo;t, because you do not respond to this fact as the <em>moral
reason</em> it is&mdash;one connected to the value of the
child&rsquo;s life. (This example is due to Markovits 2010: 227; for
other examples, see Lord 2017; Way 2017; Singh 2020; Howard 2021).</p>

<p>
What is missing? In this example, the problem seems to be that you
don&rsquo;t act from the right kind of concern: you don&rsquo;t desire
to save the child for their own sake. Perhaps, then, acting for a
normative reason, in this special sense, requires acting from the
right kind of desire. This idea is developed in different ways by
Markovits (2010: 227ff), Howard (2021), and especially by Arpaly and
Schroeder (2014). Alternatively, perhaps acting for a normative reason
requires acting from a certain kind of normative knowledge&mdash;e.g.,
knowledge that your motivating reason is a normative reason, or
knowing how to treat a normative reason appropriately. Versions of
this view are developed by Lord (2017; 2018: ch.5), Isserow (2019),
and Singh (2020). Further views have also been developed (Mantel 2014:
ch.3; Way 2017; Fogal &amp; Worsnip 2021; Whiting 2021: ch.5).</p>

<p>
One reason this issue matters is because of its bearing on questions
about responsibility. Whether we act for normative reasons often seems
to matter for whether we merit credit or praise for doing what we
ought to do. The example above illustrates this. The person who runs
into the house, since the child is inside, but from the desire for a
reward does the right thing but not in a way that is a credit to them,
or for which they deserve praise. Kant famously put this by saying
that in such a case the action lacks &ldquo;moral
worth&rdquo;&mdash;though the issues are not specific to morality.</p>

<p>
How exactly do the reasons for which we act bear on moral worth? On
the <em>right reasons view</em>, moral worth depends on acting for the
right reasons, that is, the normative reasons that make so acting
morally right. On this view, if the person had responded to the
child&rsquo;s need as the moral reason that it is, their action would
have had moral worth. This view, which in some ways develops
Aristotelian themes, though not necessarily in terms of virtue, is
influentially defended by Nomy Arpaly and Julia Markovits (Arpaly
2002; Markovits 2010; Arpaly &amp; Schroeder 2014). The view has many
attractions but as this case illustrates, it turns crucially on the
notion of acting for a normative reason and thus requires a
satisfactory account of what this amounts to. This shows how
longstanding questions about responsibility are bound up with
unresolved questions about the relationship between normative and
motivating reasons.</p>

<p>
The above is an overview of a range of problems about practical
reasons and their widespread significance. It should be sufficient to
show how the problems and their many ramifications reach into many
aspects of our lives and have important consequences for our
understanding of ourselves as rational agents.</p>
