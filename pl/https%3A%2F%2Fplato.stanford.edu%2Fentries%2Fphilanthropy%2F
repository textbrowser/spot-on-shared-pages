<h1>Philanthropy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Nov 12, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Philanthropy involves the voluntary contribution of money or other
goods and resources for broadly public purposes. Unlike taxation,
contributions are not coerced: rather, their magnitude, their
direction, and often their specific use is determined by the
donor&rsquo;s discretion. Unlike the case of ordinary market exchange,
the giver does not ask or receive payment for what she offers, though
she may receive psychological, reputational, or even material benefits
from her gift (e.g., she may feel a &ldquo;warm glow&rdquo;, see her
name above a building or on a wall honoring donors, receive perks from
the organizations she supports, or enjoy tax benefits). What
constitutes a &ldquo;public purpose&rdquo; is of course controversial,
but for now we adopt a very broad definition (excluding, e.g., gifts
to family and friends and politicians or electoral campaigns, but
otherwise inclusive as to beneficiaries and purpose). It satisfies
most ordinary understandings of philanthropy for a gift simply to be
other-regarding.</p>

<p>
Note that the above definition focuses on philanthropy as a
<em>practice.</em> Alternative definitions might attempt to specify
the philanthropic <em>motivation</em> (i.e., love of humanity,
altruism, or public-spiritedness) or philanthropic
<em>organizations</em> as a legal category. While this entry engages
with these other meanings of philanthropy, a practice-based definition
provides the most appropriate lens through which to evaluate
philosophical reflection on practices of voluntary giving and
receiving. Motives of altruism or beneficence can animate many actions
not ordinarily classed as cases of philanthropy (e.g., a decision to
run for office), and the legal and tax treatment of philanthropy
varies across time and jurisdictions. Additionally, we do not, for the
purposes of this entry, draw a distinction between
&ldquo;charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;philanthropy&rdquo;, or assume a
necessary contrast between philanthropy and justice: the relationship
of philanthropy to justice is a complicated matter that we discuss
below.</p>

<p>
We begin with a historical survey of the role of gift-giving in
philosophical traditions, followed by a discussion of the relationship
between charity or philanthropy and justice. We then turn to a more
detailed discussion of philosophical perspectives on the
<em>ethics</em> of philanthropy (e.g., moral questions for prospective
givers and recipients) and the <em>politics</em> of philanthropy
(e.g., questions about philanthropy&rsquo;s relationship to the state
and to political values like democracy and freedom). Finally, we
consider some more specific topics of contemporary philosophical
controversy.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="PhiTra">1. Philosophical Traditions</h2>

<p>
Every human society has practiced some form of gift-giving or gift
exchange with non-intimates. Altruism is universal, perhaps even
biological (see the entry on
 <a href="../altruism-biological/">biological altruism</a>).
 Despite its potential root in human nature, philanthropy has taken
many different forms; various conventions of philanthropy reveal
significant points of convergence as well as differences. Debates
about philanthropy are also bound up with central developments in
sociopolitical history and the history of moral and political
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The different words used to describe practices of non-intimate
gift-giving tend to reflect different normative valences. The term
&ldquo;philanthropy&rdquo; stems from the Ancient Greek
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&#943;&alpha;
(&ldquo;philanthr&ocirc;p&iacute;a&rdquo;) and originally referred to
the gods&rsquo; love of humankind. One of the first known usages of
the term occurs in Aeschylus&rsquo;s <em>Prometheus Bound</em>
(5<sup>th</sup> century BCE) to describe Prometheus&rsquo;s gift of
fire to humankind (in defiance of Zeus) (Sulek 2010). Fire allowed
humans more independence from the gods, which posed a challenge to the
gods&rsquo; power. Zeus&rsquo;s criticism prefigures an enduring
debate in the ethics of philanthropy regarding who is an appropriate
object of giving.</p>

<p>
Romans were more likely to use the term <em lang="la">beneficentia</em>
(beneficence), which focuses on the
quality of the outcomes to be produced rather than the motives behind
giving or the kinds of recipients to be sought. (For more on the
reception and application of this concept in modern and contemporary
philosophy, see the entry on
 <a href="../principle-beneficence/">the principle of beneficence in applied ethics</a>.)
 Cicero&rsquo;s <em>De Officiis</em> (<em>On Duties</em>) is a
quasi-philosophical how-to on navigating giving expectations in
Classical Rome. Despite many disagreements and differences,
Greco-Roman traditions exhibit certain common elements. Generally
speaking, Greco-Roman philanthropy emphasized gifts of benefit to the
city and to its citizens&mdash;<em lang="la">liturgia</em>&mdash;such
as stadiums, festivals, and military campaigns (Ober 1989; Reich 2018:
chapter 1). Expectations of making gifts outside of friends and family
were generally limited to the wealthiest members of society. Although
notionally voluntary, failure to provide gifts could incur
reputational costs or formal sanctions, such as loss of titles or
exile.</p>

<p>
Plato implicitly criticized the economic and political institutions of
Classical Athens as disordered and unvirtuous. The <em>Republic</em>
proposes common ownership of property as one potential corrective to
these ills. One of Aristotle&rsquo;s main critiques of Plato is that
the communal property regime makes no space for individual acts of
generosity, which facilitate&nbsp;friendship and are&nbsp;central to
ethical life (Irwin 1987). This dispute reverberates in subsequent
debates about the status and distribution of property and the role of
giving in ethical and political life.</p>

<p>
The Christianization of the Roman Empire largely upended Classical
giving norms. Some scholars even link the fall of the Roman Empire to
disagreements about the proper ends of philanthropic giving (Brown
2012). Early Christians discussed gift-giving in terms of <em lang="grc">agape</em>
(in Greek), <em lang="la">caritas</em> (in
Latin), and later <em>charity</em> (in English), which referred to
love for God as expressed by love for one another. For Christians, the
point of such gifts was not to fund public works for the benefit of
citizens. It was instead to bestow love on the least fortunate,
regardless of their citizenship. Moreover, Christians believed that
this practice of gift-giving was a universal virtue to be expected of
everyone, not only the wealthiest.</p>

<p>
A focus on poverty is common in other religious traditions of giving,
though the basis is often different. The Jewish norm of
<em>tzedakah</em> treats giving to the poor as a duty of justice, a
matter of strict obligation and to be made in proportion to
givers&rsquo; advantages and recipients&rsquo; needs (Topolski 2016).
The medieval Jewish philosopher
 <a href="../maimonides/">Maimonides</a>
 famously postulates an ethic of giving that ranks different
approaches, drawing special attention to the value of the
recipient&rsquo;s dignity and the donor&rsquo;s anonymity (Twersky
1980). Islamic practices contain both <em>zakat</em>, a strict
obligation to give a portion of one&rsquo;s wealth for eleemosynary
and religious purposes, as well as <em>sadaqa</em>, additional gifts
made in excess of obligation that are nonetheless praiseworthy (Hashmi
2010). Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions emphasize the unilateral
and unreciprocated character of giving (Heim 2004). The
<em>d&#257;na</em> encourages giving that indicates renunciation of
material concerns and targets worthy recipients, such as members of
monastic societies who have taken voluntary vows of poverty.</p>

<p>
A rejection of hierarchy and vertical relationships appears as a
common thread in several other non-western perspectives on
philanthropy, such as <em lang="zu">ubuntu</em>, which recommends
giving on reciprocal terms and sees it as central to the construction
of common humanity (Mottiar &amp; Ngcoya 2015).</p>

<p>
Classical and Abrahamic religious views of giving came under pressure
in the modern period thanks partly to institutional and technological
developments (Schneewind 1996). Pre-modern perspectives largely
assumed the naturalness and permanence of widespread poverty, and
philosophical perspectives developed under such conditions typically
carve out a large role for practices of private giving and its
associated virtues. Industrialization and the emergence of the modern
state revealed new possibilities for eradicating poverty as well as
the possibility that economic inequalities were heavily dependent on
social structures. In turn, debates arose over the justice of
alternative economic systems as well as the responsibilities of
different agents for addressing poverty and promoting general welfare.
Many thinkers protested extreme inequalities and urged a larger state
response. Bentham (1802/1840 [1908: 130]) excoriates the cruel
unreliability of private giving for basic needs; Kant notes that
evidence of destitution generally indicates an injustice of government
(Kant 1996: 573); and Marx and Engels dismiss private giving as a
handmaiden of capitalist exploitation (Marx &amp; Engels 1848). Other
modern thinkers, such as Wollstonecraft (1792), Mill (1869b), and
Addams (1902), questioned the relationships of domination and
subordination created by patterns of giving.</p>

<p>
From the Enlightenment onward, various critics sought to distance
philanthropy from its connection to religion, especially the Catholic
Church. To Enlightenment rationalists such as Anne-Robert Turgot,
Immanuel Kant, and Montesquieu, the Church was not merely the
propagator of religious superstitions among believers but also held in
tight possession land and capital, accumulated over centuries, that
was tied up in perpetual endowments. Mill insisted, for example, that
the state should be permitted to intervene in long-established
endowments and even, when necessary, to appropriate the assets for the
state (Mill 1869a). Perpetuity combined with fixed donor intent
established rule of the dead over the living, and this ran afoul both
of common sense and social utility. Mill therefore rejected perpetuity
and argued for time-limited endowments.</p>

<p>
Partly in response to these critiques, various commentators sought to
preserve the virtues associated with philanthropy while redirecting
its ends and developing new strategies for promoting them. Late Modern
commentators extol the potentials of philanthropy for supporting
social innovation, community enrichment, protection against government
tyranny, and international development (Sealander 2003). Andrew
Carnegie&rsquo;s 1889 &ldquo;Gospel of Wealth&rdquo; argued that the
surpluses of the wealthy should not be squandered on personal
consumption but were best put to social benefit through philanthropy
(Carnegie 1889).</p>

<p>
Prefiguring later developments in the effective altruism movement
(discussed below), Sidgwick criticized the duty of beneficence as
understood in commonsense morality and advocated a wider conception of
the duty, unlimited by geography or kinship (Sidgwick 1907).</p>

<h2 id="JusVerCha">2. Justice versus Charity</h2>

<p>
Any philosophical discussion of philanthropy must at some point engage
the effort of many modern philosophers to distinguish between the
concepts of justice and charity (variously dubbed
&ldquo;humanity&rdquo; or &ldquo;beneficence&rdquo;). According to the
French sociologist Marcel Mauss, the distinction is anticipated in
pre-modern societies when, during periods of surplus, the social
expectations concerning generosity shift from &ldquo;the ancient
morality of the gift&rdquo; to a &ldquo;principle of justice&rdquo; in
which the wealthy are seen as obligated to the poor (Mauss 1925 [1990:
18]). A social order of almsgiving and charity slowly gives way to a
distinctively modern tradition of justice (Fleischacker 2004).</p>

<p>
Stripped of its religious connotations, charity is typically
considered to involve the voluntary fulfillment of an imperfect duty,
a duty that requires agents to adopt an end but leaves to their
discretion how to fulfill it (Hill 2018; see also the entries on
 <a href="../supererogation/">supererogation</a>
 and
 <a href="../kant-moral/">Kant&rsquo;s moral philosophy</a>).
 Some, if not all, charity may be supererogatory, worthy of praise
when performed but unworthy of blame when not performed (McMahan
2018). By contrast, justice is obligatory and usually considered a
perfect duty of persons and of social institutions, a duty that admits
of limited discretion, correlates to rights and claims of specific
individuals, and may be enforced or compelled by law. Of course, the
distinction can quickly become complicated when unjust circumstances
prevail, which is to say, nearly always in actually-existing
societies. In unjust circumstances, the voluntary charitable actions
of givers can supply goods that are owed to others as a matter of
justice.</p>

<p>
Allen Buchanan rejects the firm distinction between justice and
charity (Buchanan 1987). He objects to the commonplace idea that
justice is a perfect whereas charity is an imperfect duty. Duties of
charity can be made perfect through the construction of social
institutions that identify those to whom one is obligated and provide
the means for supporting them. Thus, the common view that philanthropy
is supererogatory and discretionary because it falls under charity
rather than justice. With proper institutions, duties of aid can be
made sufficiently determinate to be socially enforced to some degree,
even if they don&rsquo;t correlate with individual rights. So,
philanthropy need not be an uncoordinated individual enterprise. In
the end, whether philanthropic duties are required as a matter of
justice depends for Buchanan on what ends philanthropy is intended to
serve and the justifiability of the social arrangements that specify
and allocate those duties. It cannot be settled by simply labeling
them matters of charity rather than justice.</p>

<p>
Will Kymlicka agrees that if justice is to be realized in a world
where our basic institutional arrangements ignore or create unjust
inequalities, then charity can be a welcome mechanism for addressing
deprivation and disadvantage (Kymlicka 2001). But, contra Buchanan,
charity is nevertheless still secondary to, and derivative of,
justice. The primary obligation of citizens is to strive to bring
about just institutions through social and political change.
Responding to injustice through private almsgiving is at best a
second-best response. This is so for two reasons. First, charity is
inefficient, a patchwork of uncoordinated efforts in which donors tend
to prefer those with similar religious or ethnoracial identities. Were
charitable efforts directed more impartially, seeking out the neediest
without concern for social identity, it would still be less effective
than thoroughgoing institutional reform. Think here of J.S.
Mill&rsquo;s view that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the great error of reformers and philanthropists in our time [is] to
nibble at the consequences of unjust power, instead of redressing the
injustice itself. (Mill 1848: V.XI.&sect;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Second is a point of principle, namely that the demands of justice
subsume and define the aims of charity. The appropriate objects of
charitable giving are those who suffer from injustice and unfairness.
&ldquo;[I]n identifying appropriate acts of charity&rdquo;, says
Kymlicka,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we invoke our criteria of justice to identify who should be giving
charity, to whom it should be given, and how much should be given.
(Kymlicka 2001: 95)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, justice crowds out the space for charity&mdash;and this is
not to be regretted (Kymlicka 2001). If acts of charity are subsumed
under the requirements of justice, then they are not truly "charity"
in the traditional sense of voluntarily giving up resources one is
entitled to keep. And if they go beyond justice, they seem more like
optional personal goals rather than moral obligations.</p>

<p>
On Kymlicka&rsquo;s view, the virtue of charity exists in name only:
it is either defined by justice (and hence not an independent virtue)
or beyond justice (and hence not a moral requirement). The only way to
give charity more theoretical space is via a radically different
vision of justice. One such alternative (to be discussed later) is
libertarianism.</p>

<p>
This assumes, it must be said, a restricted view of charity. But for
many, philanthropy has a weaker association with addressing
deprivation and disadvantage or meeting the demands of distributive
justice. Donating to a museum, for instance, is not an obligation of
justice and yet many perceive this as a philanthropic act. Some donors
may perceive their actions as an expression of their conception of the
good, their understanding of what is valuable in life, or their
personal tastes. Thus, for many it is crucial to emphasize
philanthropy&rsquo;s role in providing <em>non</em>-justice goods
alongside its involvement in the realization or hindrance of justice
(see Pevnick 2013; Lechterman 2022; Schiller 2023).</p>

<h2 id="EthGiv">3. Ethics of Giving</h2>

<h3 id="VirEth">3.1 Virtue Ethics</h3>

<p>
Consequentialist perspectives and their deontological critics have
dominated much of the recent philosophical discussion of philanthropy.
But the virtue ethics tradition provides a much longer history of
philosophical reflection on giving. And from Aristotle to the Stoics
to contemporary perspectives, virtually all philosophers whom one
might place in the virtue ethics tradition have agreed that traits
like generosity and compassion are important virtues. (Nietzsche, a
controversial candidate for inclusion as a virtue ethicist, is a
possible exception.) Aristotle offers up one of the earliest and most
enduring reflections on the ethics of giving, writing</p>

<blockquote>

To give away money is an easy matter and in any man&rsquo;s power. But
to decide to whom to give it, and how large, and when, and for what

<p>
Virtue ethical perspectives treat characteristics of the virtuous
agent as primary, rather than as derivative of moral duties or reasons
to promote good states of affairs. They emphasize the cultivation of
good moral character, which will have important implications for what
matters in evaluating philanthropy: rather than simply assessing
whether donors have done their duty, or whether they have promoted
impartially good states of affairs, we will want to know about the
character of the giver (which cannot be assessed on the basis of a
single act of giving). Her <em>motive</em> and <em>disposition</em>
will be important objects of ethical evaluation. Unlike a utilitarian,
a virtue ethicist has reason to censure large-scale philanthropy
motivated by a desire for prestige. And unlike a Kantian, a virtue
ethicist will not be satisfied by donors acting from duty (even
against inclination): the fully virtuous individual (unlike the merely
continent one) does not experience internal conflict or engage in
virtuous action only after a struggle (Hursthouse &amp; Pettigrove
2016 [2023]).</p>

<p>
Another important concept in the virtue ethics tradition is
<em>phronesis,</em> or practical wisdom. Virtues are not simply
emotional dispositions like pity, which a child might have (Hursthouse
1999; Hursthouse &amp; Pettigrove 2016 [2023]). Rather, they are
characteristics of rational agents who have learned from experience
how to choose virtuous actions in a range of situations. The
well-intentioned but thoughtless or profligate giver therefore lacks
the virtue of the thoughtful and provident donor. In that sense, a
kind of folk virtue ethics animates many classic discussions of giving
by non-philosophers, such as Andrew Carnegie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gospel of
Wealth&rdquo; (1889).</p>

<p>
Virtue ethicists encourage us to disaggregate our ethical analyses:
G.E.M. Anscombe&rsquo;s pathbreaking &ldquo;Modern Moral
Philosophy&rdquo; argues that, rather than saying something is
(morally) &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, it is better to always name &ldquo;a
genus such as &lsquo;untruthful,&rsquo; &lsquo;unchaste,&rsquo;
&lsquo;unjust&rsquo;&rdquo; (Anscombe 1958: 9). While they have been
in the minority in contemporary philosophical discussion of
philanthropy (e.g., Swanton 2018; Martin 1994), virtue ethical
perspectives have the potential to vary and deepen the terms of
discussion about it. When debate is framed in terms of whether making
or accepting a philanthropic donation is right or wrong (or
permissible or impermissible), some objections to philanthropy may be
difficult to understand without availing ourselves of virtue
ethics&rsquo; more granular vocabulary. For example, it may be morally
permissible for a private university to sell naming rights to its
graduate school of arts and sciences for $100 million dollars: both
the donor and the university may be acting within their rights. But
this need not mean that there are no ethical objections to be made:
selling naming rights in this way might be &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; or
&ldquo;undignified&rdquo; even if not &ldquo;morally wrong&rdquo; in a
general sense.</p>

<p>
Crucially, it is not only virtues for <em>givers</em> about which a
virtue ethicist will have something to say. There are also virtues of
recipients: most importantly gratitude, but perhaps also providence
and self-respect. Since contemporary philosophical discussion of
philanthropy generally privileges the moral perspective of donors,
virtue ethics also has the potential to contribute to a discussion of
the ethics of receiving gifts (for both individuals and
institutions).</p>

<p>
As they develop, it will be important for virtue ethical perspectives
on giving to consider the possibility of tensions between virtues
(e.g., between compassion and respect, or between gratitude and
dignity). Are any apparent tensions illusory or resolvable with
sufficient practical wisdom? Or are there sometimes irresolvable
conflicts between virtues that may limit the ability of virtue ethical
perspectives to provide determinate action guidance? A further
question is whether virtue <em>ethical</em> perspectives can
contribute to the growing literature on philanthropy in
<em>political</em> philosophy: perhaps, for example, by considering
how the virtues and dispositions that should guide individual givers
and recipients might be cultivated (or undermined) through political
action.</p>

<h3 id="EffAltOthConVie">3.2 Effective Altruism and Other Consequentialist Views</h3>

<p>
Aristotle may have set the agenda long ago for the most essential
questions to answer concerning philanthropy. But until recently,
contemporary philosophers have had little to say about philanthropy,
perhaps because their concerns have been directed in large part to
questions of justice. That has changed with effective altruism.
Effective altruism is the label for an umbrella of views that are the
product of recent philosophical argument that has also given rise to a
growing social movement far beyond the quarters of philosophy
departments and academic journals.</p>

<p>
According to one of its most prominent exponents, William MacAskill,
effective altruism asks individuals how they can make the biggest
difference or maximize the good they can do in the world. It invites
people to use evidence and reason to determine how to benefit others
as much as possible (MacAskill 2019: 13). Effective altruism&rsquo;s
roots, however, can be found in Peter Singer&rsquo;s argument, dating
back to his famous 1972 article, &ldquo;Famine, Affluence, and
Morality&rdquo;, that persons in the developed world have strong
obligations to address desperate global poverty (and, as he would
later argue, resist the inhumane treatment of sentient animals)
(Singer 1972; Singer 1975). Singer&rsquo;s pond example from that
article prefigures the moral force of effective altruism. Singer asks
the reader to imagine walking past a shallow pond in which a small
child is drowning. It would be trivially easy to wade into the pond
and rescue the child, but doing so would soil one&rsquo;s clothes and
make one late for work. Nevertheless, it would seem that we have a
moral obligation to rescue the child; it would be morally monstrous
not to do so.</p>

<p>
Singer then argues that there is no morally relevant difference
between the drowning child and a child in a poor country who will die
without our assistance. Just as one has a moral duty to save the
drowning child, we have a similar obligation to assist people in
extreme poverty through donations to effective charities. Still more,
taking the argument to its logical conclusion, individuals are
obligated to divest themselves of resources to assist desperately
needy others up to the point of being only marginally better off than
those they would assist. Yet of course few people offer assistance to
the global poor and almost none donate large percentages of their
wealth for this purpose. One sees in the pond example some of the core
claims of effective altruism&mdash;that all lives have equal moral
worth, and distance or nationality or even membership in a
generational cohort in time are not morally relevant factors.
Effective altruism counsels us to maximize the good we can do for
others, on impartial and welfarist grounds, using evidence and
reason.</p>

<p>
Effective altruism is responsible for inspiring a number of different
organizations dedicated to spreading its message and reducing the
effort involved in identifying highly effective charitable
organizations, including Giving What We Can (where members pledge to
donate at least 10 percent of their income to effective charities),
80,000 Hours (offering advice on effective altruist career choices),
the Centre for Effective Altruism (founded by philosophers William
MacAskill and Toby Ord), the charity rating organization GiveWell, and
the grant maker Open Philanthropy.</p>

<p>
Some of its proponents, such as MacAskill, eschew the idea that
effective altruism is committed to utilitarianism or any other
substantive moral view. For many others the consequentialist
underpinnings are important. Though maximizing the good one can do in
the world might allow for a variety of ways of defining the good,
effective altruism seems committed to producing the best outcomes or,
in prospect, identifying the best action by measuring the expected
value of any action. The motive of the donor matters little or not at
all. As a result, consequentialists embrace the idea of self-interest
(e.g., the production of a &ldquo;warm glow&rdquo; in giving; taking
satisfaction in doing good) alongside benefits to others. And they are
eager to embrace self-interest when it might be shown to be useful in
stimulating others to give or to give more (e.g., naming rights on
buildings, reputational competition in philanthropic giving).</p>

<p>
In recent years, effective altruism has spawned two new developments:
earning to give and longtermism. Earning to give takes the approach of
effective altruism and applies it to one&rsquo;s time and career
choice: what job should one take to maximize good in the world?
Against conventional wisdom that doing good in the world involves
working at an international aid organization, for example, earning to
give suggests that an individual choose a high-earning career path
with the intention of donating a significant portion of income to
highly effective charities. By maximizing one&rsquo;s earnings
potential, effective altruists claim that one may do more good overall
by donating that money to carefully selected charities than through
typical altruistic career paths. The cryptocurrency mogul Sam
Bankman-Fried adopted this approach, allegedly because of a college
encounter with William MacAskill, in choosing a career that might earn
him billions and allow him to donate most of it to effective altruist
causes. (Bankman-Fried was convicted of criminal charges related to
his cryptocurrency platform in 2023.)</p>

<p>
Longtermism extends the concern of effective altruism from seeking to
improve currently living human beings (and animals) to seeking to
influence the indefinite future and the interest in there being a
great many future generations. As a practical matter, this orients
effective altruism away from identifying highly effective aid
organizations and toward reducing existential risks to humanity, low
probability events that could prevent future generations from coming
into existence (Ord 2020; MacAskill 2022).</p>

<p>
Critics of effective altruism frequently point to its antipolitics and
strong orientation toward individual rather than institutional change
(see Srinivasan 2015; Berkey 2018; Dietz 2019; Lechterman 2020; Crary
2021). Srinivasan, for example, criticizes effective altruism for a
certain paradoxical conservatism. Despite its ambition to change the
world for the better, the effective altruist takes the political and
organizational structure of the world as is&mdash;global capitalism,
minimalist democracy, and the existing set of international aid
organizations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
No expected value calculation is likely to counsel an individual to
undertake to uproot capitalism, build a new political movement, or
even start a new aid organization,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
she writes (Srinivasan 2015).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Its utilitarian calculations presuppose that everyone else will
continue to conduct business as usual; the world is a given, in which
one can make careful, piecemeal interventions. The tacit assumption is
that the individual, not the community, class or state, is the proper
object of moral theorizing. (ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Critics of longtermism may hold that we have stronger duties to the
present and near-term generations because the relationships and causal
connections we share make us more responsible for their interests.
They may also point to the difficulty of predicting the effects of our
actions over the long term, especially in comparison with more
reliable predictions we can make about nearer events (Tarsney 2023).
Others may point to controversial axioms prominent longtermists hold
about population ethics (Setiya 2022). Some have sought to defend
Parfit&rsquo;s Repugnant Conclusion (Parfit 1984), which holds that
maximizing wellbeing can lead us to prefer a world of many lives
barely worth living over an alternative world where a smaller
population enjoys flourishing lives (see the entry on
 <a href="../repugnant-conclusion/">the repugnant conclusion</a>).
 
<h3 id="NonVie">3.3 Nonconsequentialist Views</h3>

<p>
Kant, and those influenced by him, generally discuss philanthropy in
connection with the virtue of beneficence, which directs us to promote
the happiness of others and assist others in need (Kant 1797; see the
entry on
 <a href="../kant-moral/">Kant&rsquo;s moral philosophy</a>).
 Beneficence is an imperfect duty, meaning that determining its
targets and strategies requires individual judgment and cannot be
defined in advance (Hill 2018). Imperfect duties are contrasted with
perfect duties, like justice and promise-keeping, which admit of less
discretion and whose satisfaction ordinarily take priority
(ibid.).</p>

<p>
Kant requires that individuals be attentive to others&rsquo; needs and
respond to emergencies, and he stresses that beneficence is not
optional, even as he denies that beneficence must always be impartial
among potential objects or maximizing in its focus. He allows that
individuals may sometimes count personal attachments as reasons to
favor some persons or causes over others, and he supports investments
in culture and education as necessary for cultivating human virtues.
Proponents of a Kantian approach defend Kant&rsquo;s lack of
systematic guidance on these questions, stressing that choosing whom
to benefit and how requires many personal and contextual judgments
that resist precise calculation (Hill 2018).</p>

<p>
It is important to consider Kant&rsquo;s moral theory in connection
with his political and legal theory, which covers property rights,
economic institutions, and constitutional design. Kant assigns to the
state the duty to insure against absolute deprivation, and he has
mixed feelings about private almsgiving as a general
practice&mdash;calling it demeaning (Kant <em>Lectures on Ethics</em>:
AK 27:455 [1997: 209]) and illustrative of government injustice, while
at the same time noting that unjustly rich citizens may indeed have
duties to give alms, but as duties of reparative justice rather than
beneficence (Kant 1797 AK 6:454 [1996: 573).</p>

<p>
For an effective altruist, the core question is how one person can
benefit another person, and the relationship placed in the foreground
is benefactor to beneficiary. But for Kant, the core question is about
justice, and the relationship placed in the foreground is mutual
respect and accountability. (For more on the contrast between
effective altruism and Kant, see Darwall 2024). Furthermore, because
on Kant&rsquo;s view the immiseration of some is likelier due to
injustice than misfortune, the voluntary action of the advantaged to
assist the disadvantaged is improperly described as charity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Having the resources to practice such beneficence as depends on the
goods of fortune is, for the most part, a result of certain human
beings being favored through the injustice of government, which
introduces an inequality of wealth that makes others need their
beneficence. Under such circumstances, does a rich man&rsquo;s help to
the needy, on which he so readily prides himself as something
meritorious, really deserve to be called beneficence at all? (Kant
1797 AK 6:454 [1996: 573])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kant assigns the state the duty to provide public goods, noting that
private action on behalf of the public can often be unauthorized,
unilateral vigilantism (Ripstein 2009). To be legitimate, action that
affects all members of a society must be authorized by all of them
omnilaterally. Similar arguments can be found in contemporary Kantian
treatments of philanthropy, which tend to see philanthropy as
completing and adorning the work of just institutions and temporarily
repairing the mistakes of unjust institutions, but never seeking to
supplant them (e.g., Herman 2001; Cordelli 2016, 2020).</p>

<p>
In addition to positive guidance about duties to give, deontological
perspectives can be important in specifying <em>constraints</em> on
philanthropic action. Without providing a complete positive theory of
how or how much one ought to give, neo-Kantians have argued that
donors&rsquo; moral discretion to give as they like does not apply
under conditions of institutional injustice, where wealthy
people&rsquo;s moral claims to their property are significantly weaker
than is generally supposed (Cordelli 2016, 2020).</p>

<h2 id="PolGiv">4. Politics of Giving</h2>

<h3 id="TenBetPhiDem">4.1 Tensions between Philanthropy and Democracy</h3>

<p>
The relationship between philanthropy and democracy is a question of
longstanding interest (e.g., Tocqueville 1840 [2000: 485&ndash;92]).
Of course, a state need not be democratic for tensions between public
power and private philanthropy to arise: Livy and Machiavelli, for
example, both note that munificent citizens can acquire popularity and
power through their giving, in ways that present threats to ruling
political elites. But the role of philanthropy, and especially
philanthropy by the very rich, is often thought to present particular
problems in democratic societies (Reich 2018). Big philanthropy
represents the direction of private resources toward some public
purpose or influence, and in this respect it is an exercise of power.
Democracies promise their citizens political equality and equal
opportunity for voice or influence over important public decisions. By
contrast, large scale philanthropy gives donors the power to influence
public outcomes and thereby threatens to amplify the voices of the
wealthy. In this respect, big philanthropy is a plutocratic element in
a democratic setting, and the relevant question to be asked is whether
wealth can be domesticated to serve rather than subvert core
democratic principles and practices (Reich 2018).</p>

<p>
Some democratic perspectives focus on the concept of
<em>legitimacy</em> and attempt to resolve the tensions between
philanthropy and democracy by more strictly delimiting the appropriate
role of philanthropy in the institutional division of labor. Cordelli
(2020) offers a Kantian argument against the privatization of state
functions, which applies to much <em>non-</em>profit (not just
for-profit) private action. On her account, privatization represents
an illegitimate outsourcing of decision-making power to private
actors, who are empowered to define and affect people&rsquo;s rights
in ways that can only legitimately be done by a state&rsquo;s
democratically authorized and accountable representatives. Beerbohm
(2016) and Pevnick (2016) also attempt to isolate the state functions
that must remain under democratic control. And Lechterman (2022)
develops an account of &ldquo;democratic sovereignty&rdquo; which
charges that philanthropic influence over essential public goods or
matters of basic justice violates citizens&rsquo; rights to
self-determination.</p>

<p>
Many recent normative theories of democracy link its justification to
a concern for people&rsquo;s ability to relate as social equals,
rather than as superiors and inferiors (e.g., Anderson 1999; Kolodny
2014, 2023; Wilson 2019). Social or relational egalitarian theories of
democracy, while often focused on formal political institutions and
processes, have reason to be concerned about social inequalities that
arise informally&mdash;including through philanthropy, which has the
potential to contribute to informal hierarchies of control and esteem.
Saunders-Hastings (2019, 2022a) argues for a presumption against
giving in <em>paternalistic</em> ways that express disrespect for the
judgment of beneficiaries&nbsp;and that may contribute to
subordinating relationships. The concern that philanthropy can express
objectionable forms of paternalism grows stronger still once one
considers that philanthropy consists not only of isolated transactions
but often creates ongoing relationships between donors and recipients
(e.g., in institutional settings). According to Saunders-Hastings and
Reich (2024), paternalism involves one party putting itself in a
position of longer-term authority over an autonomous agent and making
judgments on their behalf, even if the paternalized party consents.
Thus, paternalism can be objectionable even if it makes the
paternalized party better off&nbsp;and they genuinely consent. The
wrong lies in the insult to autonomy and the unequal power dynamic,
not just in coercion or negative outcomes. Philanthropic foundations
often act paternalistically by retaining control over decision making
and imposing their own judgments rather than empowering grantees and
beneficiaries. Respect for those affected requires foundations to give
them more of a say, both for instrumental reasons (local knowledge
improves outcomes) and intrinsic reasons (mitigating power imbalances
and respecting autonomy).</p>

<p>
Some perspectives argue that the relationship between philanthropy and
democracy can be complementary, or that the tensions between
philanthropy and democracy can be resolved through institutional
designs that render philanthropy compatible with democratic ideals.
Reich (2018) argues that philanthropy can be supportive of democracy
when it contributes to the distinctive goods of <em>pluralism</em>
(i.e., in the provision of public goods) and <em>discovery</em>
(roughly, innovation in the provision of public goods, in ways that
electoral incentives may militate against). For Reich, if democracy is
construed as a political system that champions a diverse and
contestatory civil society, then philanthropic support from a broad
base of ordinary citizens can provide one form of fuel for a
pluralistic civil society and diminish governmental orthodoxy in
defining its contours. Institutionalized philanthropy, such as through
philanthropic foundations, can be one vehicle for experimentalism in
social problem-solving, over longer-time horizons than state agencies
and commercial firms are likely to undertake. Pevnick (2013) argues
that the nonprofit sector might be democratized if the power to
contribute were more widely dispersed, e.g., by replacing existing tax
mechanisms for subsidizing philanthropy with vouchers distributed in
equal amounts to all citizens. Rubenstein (2022) argues that
small-dollar donating is itself a democratic practice. MacKenzie
(2021) has proposed using participatory budgeting models within
philanthropic foundations to democratize the allocation of funds.</p>

<p>
The tensions between philanthropy and democracy are often explored
within the context of the nation-state, but some philosophers explore
them in a global context. International non-governmental organizations
(INGOs) are often government-funded, but many rely at least in part on
philanthropic funding (from either elite donors, large numbers of
small donors, or a combination thereof). There is ongoing debate as to
whether the activities of INGOs ought to be understood as a form of
(unelected) interest-representation, and how (if at all) such
representation can meet democratic standards (Rubenstein 2015;
Montanaro 2018). Others have proposed mechanisms for democratizing the
allocation of international philanthropic funds themselves: Tanasoca
and Dryzek (2021) advocate for deliberative democratic fora in which
the global poor could exercise collective voice in the direction of
proposed donations.</p>

<h3 id="PhiFre">4.2 Philanthropy and Freedom</h3>

<p>
Libertarian views vary in their justifications and implications, but
most tend to create comparatively wide space for philanthropy as a
consequence of limiting the scope of permissible state action. For
libertarians, freedom is typically understood as non-interference with
individual choices (except to prevent harm or protect the rights of
others) and a just society is one that minimizes the exercise of
coercive force. Liberty encompasses the freedom to allocate
one&rsquo;s resources according to one&rsquo;s preferences, and it
includes the permission to donate one&rsquo;s resources to willing
recipients. For libertarians, philanthropy&mdash;as with marketplace
activity&mdash;can be understood as a form of consensual exchange or
contract (Nozick 1974). A society organized largely in terms of
voluntary transactions will likely contain many inequalities and unmet
needs. Consequently, libertarians tend to see philanthropy as an
especially praiseworthy exercise of liberty (Lomasky 1995). But it is
more than praiseworthy; a libertarian view emphasizes the beneficial
outcomes and moral superiority of philanthropy when compared to
government-provided assistance. Charity is regarded as a commendable
and liberty-preserving means of aiding the underprivileged, as it is
voluntary in nature, unlike public provision, which relies on state
coercion through taxation and redistribution. Consequently, private
charity is considered to have greater legitimacy than government
programs. Furthermore, libertarians argue that, due to its often
localized and innovative approach, private charity is more likely to
yield effective results than government aid.</p>

<p>
However, this position also suggests that the appropriate role of the
state with respect to philanthropy is not to subsidize it (which
involves interfering with the liberty of some for the benefit of
others) (Fleischer 2010). And the state is generally to respect and
enforce the terms that donors choose to attach to their
gifts&mdash;despite the disadvantages this may create for recipients
and third parties (Florino 2016).</p>

<p>
Republicans understand freedom as non-domination, where to be
dominated is to be susceptible to arbitrary exercises of power (Pettit
1997). Government legitimacy requires that power is limited in ways
that track citizens&rsquo; interests. But the threat of domination can
also come from private sources, and republicans are especially
critical of dominating relationships between philanthropists and
beneficiaries, who may depend on gifts for their livelihood and thus
live a precarious and servile existence. Republican arguments can thus
lend support to institutional designs that seek to make the
necessities of life more reliably accessible. The welfare state and
universal basic income schemes are familiar proposals here (Pettit
2006). However, republicanism also supports the position that a
sufficient number of philanthropists competing in an area can limit
domination by enabling beneficiaries to choose more freely among them
(Taylor 2018). For many republicans, whether or how much philanthropy
dominates depends on background conditions and policy choices.
Additionally, a prominent theme in republican thought is the
importance of a contestatory citizenry for checking government
domination (Pettit 2012). Such efforts require resources, and
philanthropy is the most obvious source of funds for civil society
organizations that monitor, protest, and advocate (Lechterman &amp;
Reich 2020).</p>

<h2 id="CurCon">5. Current Controversies</h2>

<h3 id="ProDirMon">5.1 The Problem of Dirty Money</h3>

<p>
Putatively &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; or &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; gifts are a
perennial source of controversy in the ethics and politics of
philanthropy. Is it morally permissible to accept tainted wealth if it
supports a praiseworthy cause? &ldquo;Dirty money&rdquo; and related
terms (e.g., tainted money, blood money) can be used in different
ways. In legal and business contexts, these terms are often used
narrowly to refer to money that represents the proceeds of illegal
activities such as fraud or organized crime (i.e., money that needs to
be &ldquo;laundered&rdquo;). Philosophers often use the terms more
broadly, to refer to money or other goods produced from unjust or
otherwise seriously morally objectionable activities, transactions,
and relationships (even if the activities in question are not
illegal). More broadly still, &ldquo;dirty money&rdquo; can refer to
gifts from controversial donors, even if moral criticisms of the
donors are not primarily about how their wealth was acquired (e.g.,
donations from accused or convicted sex offenders, such as Jeffrey
Epstein or Harvey Weinstein). Prominent contemporary examples include
debates about whether universities and art institutions should refuse
or return gifts from the Sackler family, given their company Purdue
Pharma&rsquo;s role in the opioid epidemic.</p>

<p>
Traditionally, worries about dirty money have been more prominent in
non-consequentialist philosophical traditions. Both consequentialists
and non-consequentialists can take account of the potential bad
effects of accepting dirty money, such as the risk of legitimizing or
further encouraging harmful economic activities. But for
consequentialists, the potential for donations to do good (relative to
the relevant alternative uses to which the money might be put) will
often outweigh these risks. Peter Singer, for example, has argued
against a generalized rejection of Sackler money (Singer 2019). Put in
the extreme, one thinks of the adage attributed to the founder of the
Salvation Army, William Booth, who is alleged to have said, &ldquo;The
only problem with tainted money is that there just tain&rsquo;t enough
of it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Dirty money debates often focus on particularly famous individuals or
families. However, objections to institutions profiting from&mdash;and
to donors&rsquo; discretion in disposing of&mdash;ill-gotten gains
potentially apply much more widely. Cordelli (2016, 2020) argues that
<em>everything</em> that donors own, beyond what they would have under
just institutions, is morally speaking not theirs at all; they should
therefore enjoy no moral discretion in deciding how to spend
it&nbsp;but should instead direct it to improving the condition of the
worst off members of society, as a demand of reparative justice. For
philosophers who object to economic injustice more broadly, and not
only to particular bad actors, any distinction between clean and dirty
money may be difficult to sustain.</p>

<h3 id="CorGivCorSocRes">5.2 Corporate Giving and Corporate Social Responsibility</h3>

<p>
One of the most striking developments in the practice of philanthropy
over the past several decades has been the attempts to combine
philanthropy with commercial activity. Should business firms engage in
philanthropy, and if so, how? Strong social norms support the donation
of some portion of profits to charitable causes. Corporate
philanthropy might be justified, for instance, on the grounds that
corporations have surplus resources that can often be put to better
uses than padding executive salaries or lining shareholders&rsquo;
pockets. Perhaps businesses owe donations to society in return for
their many privileges. However, corporate philanthropy also invites
fundamental criticisms. Some libertarians, such as the economist
Milton Friedman, hold that the social responsibility of business is to
increase profits, and therefore corporate philanthropy is tantamount
to theft of shareholder&rsquo;s assets (Friedman 1970). Corporate
profits are shareholders&rsquo; property, and it is the right of
shareholders&mdash;not business managers&mdash;to determine whether
and how to donate their property. A more recent &ldquo;market
failures&rdquo; view holds that businesses maximize their contribution
to social welfare by seeking efficiency, which they accomplish by
conscientious profit-seeking (Heath 2014). From this perspective,
directly seeking good outcomes through philanthropy may reduce
firms&rsquo; efficiency gains and compromise their contributions to
social welfare. Democratic critics question the potential distortions
to political equality of corporate giving programs, which may allow
corporations disproportionate influence over matters of common
concern, and the ways in which firms&rsquo; business goals may distort
their philanthropic priorities (Lechterman 2022; Saunders-Hastings
2022b). And a common cynical view regards philanthropy as a way of
deflecting attention from misconduct and exploitation in other areas
of a firm&rsquo;s business activities. Critics of corporate
philanthropy often agree there are nonetheless certain limited forms
of corporate giving that may be morally permissible if not morally
required in certain cases, such as the sharing of proprietary
resources during emergencies (Mejia 2021).</p>

<p>
A more recent development shows organizations blending commercial and
philanthropic purposes more fundamentally, by designing business
models that seek to achieve social goals using commercial tactics.
So-called social enterprise offers many potential advantages. For
instance, by eliminating donations from the equation, such
organizations may work against longstanding worries about inequitable
benefactor-beneficiary relations. Additionally, the ability to draw on
multiple funding sources may make their services easier to sustain.
But their unusual combination of purposes and tactics may create
conflicts of interest that create challenges for their stakeholders.
The aggressive pursuit of social-problem-solving by entrepreneurs may
also raise democratic concerns about power and voice. Under what
conditions is social enterprise a morally superior approach to
conventional philanthropy or business, a valuable complement to
conventional forms and strategies, or neither (Lechterman &amp; Mair
2024)?</p>

<h3 id="TaxTreGiv">5.3 Tax Treatment of Giving</h3>

<p>
In the modern age, philanthropy is a legally codified and
institutionalized practice. It&rsquo;s possible, of course, to give
money away outside the sight of the state. But contemporary
philanthropy is embedded within a legal framework, varying across
societies, that structures and defines its practice. Whether, when, to
whom, and how much a person gives is to some extent a consequence of
laws that govern the establishment of not-for-profit organizations,
charitable trusts, philanthropic and community foundations, and
related charitable vehicles such as donor-advised funds. Donor intent
is protected by the law in many different countries, and charitable
endowments and philanthropic foundations are often legally designed to
exist beyond the grave in perpetuity.</p>

<p>
Beyond establishing legal entities and frameworks, however, one of the
most distinctive and controversial practices concerns whether the law
should provide affirmative encouragement for philanthropy via
advantageous tax treatment. Philanthropy is often considered a
paradigmatic example of voluntary activity, nothing more than the
rightful exercise of one&rsquo;s liberty to dispose of one&rsquo;s
possessions as one likes. But in many countries, philanthropy is a
tax-advantaged activity, and therefore subsidized by citizens.</p>

<p>
The tax treatment of charitable donations in the United States allows
individuals to deduct (up to some limit) the sum of their eligible
charitable donations from their taxable income. However, this policy
instrument contains a plutocratic bias that favors the wealthy and
their charitable projects. The deduction creates an &ldquo;upside-down
effect&rdquo; where higher income earners in a system of progressive
taxation receive a larger subsidy for the same charitable contribution
compared to lower income earners. Insofar as charitable giving is a
virtue, the cost of virtue is distributed unevenly.</p>

<p>
But if the distribution of charitable contributions were directed
chiefly, or better exclusively, at the deprived and disadvantaged, the
plutocratic bias of a tax deduction might be less objectionable.
Whatever the amount of the subsidy, it is the beneficiary that matters
most. Liam Murphy and Thomas Nagel point in this direction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The word charity suggests that this deduction is a means of
decentralizing the process by which a community discharges its
collective responsibility to alleviate the worst aspects of life at
the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Since there is disagreement
about what the exact nature of that responsibility is, and about which
are the most efficient agencies, it is arguably a good idea for the
state to subsidize individuals&rsquo; contributions to agencies of
their choice rather than making all the decisions about the use of
public funds for this purpose. (Murphy &amp; Nagel 2002: 127)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But they quickly reverse ground because the catalogue of eligible
charitable organizations in the United States includes cultural and
educational organizations, far beyond organizations whose mission it
is to fight poverty and disadvantage.</p>

<p>
If support for the pluralism of civil society rather than the
fulfillment of basic needs is the rationale for public subsidies for
philanthropy, then the policy instrument of a charitable tax deduction
is harder to support. The plutocratic bias in the charitable deduction
policies means that the public funds forgone due to the deduction flow
disproportionately to the favored charities and causes of the wealthy.
The charitable priorities of the rich are weighted more heavily than
those of lower and middle-income households. According to data from
2005, the distribution of charitable giving across causes differs
significantly between high-income and general households. Religious
and basic-needs organizations receive a much smaller share of
donations from high-income households compared to the general
population (Reich 2018: chapter 2).</p>

<p>
If a key justification for tax exemptions for charitable giving is to
support a diverse and pluralistic civil society that amplifies the
voices of citizens, then the current charitable deduction fails this
test. Its plutocratic bias makes it indefensible from the perspective
of supporting democracy. Some argue that the tax advantages should be
eliminated. Others, such as Pevnick (2016), argue that it should be
replaced with a flat tax credit, available to all taxpayers, that
provides an equal subsidy for the charitable contributions of all
citizens regardless of income. This would better align tax policy with
the aim of promoting equality of citizen voice and influence in civil
society.</p>

<h2 id="Con">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This entry has traced debates over the concept, conception, and
practice of philanthropy across periods and schools of philosophical
thought. As we have seen, philanthropy raises ethical and political
issues that have long been subjects of philosophical investigation;
more recently, a contemporary philosophical literature has developed
that considers philanthropy as a distinctive space of ethical and
political action. Space limitations naturally preclude a comprehensive
treatment of the topics we have chosen, and we have omitted many
interesting and important topics altogether. We have made only brief
contact with the ethics of nonprofit organizations (the intermediaries
of philanthropic gifts), as a related but distinct topic of
philosophical study. We have entirely ignored the question of state
philanthropy, i.e., whether philanthropy is something in which states
can also engage, and if so, how such a practice might figure in moral
and political philosophy (Dworkin 1985; Murphy &amp; Nagel 2002;
Weinberg 2011). As philosophers show increasing interest in the topic
of philanthropy, we look forward to further efforts to unravel
lingering puzzles about this crucial and stimulating topic.</p>
