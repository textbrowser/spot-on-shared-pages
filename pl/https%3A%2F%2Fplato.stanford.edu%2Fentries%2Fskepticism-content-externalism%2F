<p>
Content externalism (CE) is roughly the thesis that the contents of a
person&rsquo;s thoughts are partly determined by facts about the
person&rsquo;s social or physical environment. Although the central
arguments for CE presuppose our ordinary, non-skeptical beliefs, CE
itself implies that we can each describe subjectively equivalent
worlds in which we would receive the same sensory stimulations that we
receive in the actual world, but the contents of our thoughts differ
from the contents of our thoughts in the actual world. If we accept CE
and ask how we know the contents of our own thoughts, we therefore
face the following dilemma. Either:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>First horn</em>. We cannot know the contents of our own thoughts
in the actual world without empirical investigation, since (a) we do
not know without empirical investigation which of our subjectively
equivalent worlds we are in, and (b) the contents of our thoughts are
not the same in all our subjectively equivalent worlds; or</p>

<p>
<em>Second horn</em>. We <em>can</em> know the contents of our own
thoughts in the actual world without empirical investigation and from
this knowledge we can deduce that we are not in any subjectively
equivalent world in which the contents of our thoughts differ from the
contents of our thoughts in the actual world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first horn conflicts with our ordinary assumption that we can know
the contents of our own thoughts without empirical investigation. The
second horn conflicts with the Cartesian skeptical intuition that
<em>we may actually be in any one of our subjectively equivalent
worlds</em>. Philosophers who accept CE typically reject the first
horn by applying one of the strategies explained in the entry on
 <a href="../self-knowledge-externalism/">externalism and self-knowledge</a>.
 The present entry grants that one of these strategies is successful
and focuses on the second horn. This horn forces us to confront the
central question about CE and skepticism, namely,</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(Q)</dt>
<dd>Is the Cartesian skeptical intuition that we may actually be in
any one of our subjectively equivalent worlds compatible with CE
despite appearances to the contrary, or, if not, are there
reformulations of the intuition that are compatible with CE and enable
us to formulate challenging Cartesian skeptical arguments?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are two main streams of literature about the second horn that
aim to clarify or answer (Q), one that begins with Michael
McKinsey&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Anti-Individualism and Privileged
Access&rdquo; (McKinsey 1991) and another that begins with Hilary
Putnam&rsquo;s chapter &ldquo;Brains in a Vat&rdquo; (Putnam 1981).
This entry surveys the literature in these two streams in sections 6
and 7, after explaining key concepts, definitions, and arguments that
one needs to know to understand this literature, namely, Cartesian
arguments and hypotheses (section 1), Cartesian assumptions about
epistemic possibility and thought content (section 2), CE and its
varieties (section 3), CE and epistemic possibility (section 4), and
the central dilemma for CE in skeptical contexts (section 5).</p>

<h2 id="CarSkeArgHyp">1. Cartesian skeptical arguments and hypotheses</h2>

<p>
It&rsquo;s sunny today, or so I believe, as I look out the window. But
could I be dreaming? And if so, do I know that it&rsquo;s sunny today?
According to a standard formulation of an argument in Descartes,
<em>Meditation One</em> (paragraph 5), for any statement \(p\) about
the world around me that I believe, such as <em>it&rsquo;s sunny
today</em>, I should reason as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>If I know that \(p\), then I know that I am not dreaming that
\(p\).</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>I do not know that I am not dreaming that \(p\).</dd>
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, I do not know that \(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is a paradigm example of a <em>Cartesian skeptical argument</em>.
If it is sound, it shows that we do not know any of the things we
ordinarily take ourselves to know about the world around us.</p>

<p>
Argument (1)&ndash;(3) is valid and most of us find premise (1)
compelling. Premise (2) appears compelling if one also accepts
<em>Dream</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Dream</em>. Anything that can be going on or that one can
experience in one&rsquo;s waking life can also be dreamt about.
(Stroud 1984: 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For <em>Dream</em> appears to imply that no matter how vivid my
experience as of being awake may be, I cannot know that I am not
dreaming. Argument (1)&ndash;(3) therefore appears to be sound.</p>

<p>
Against <em>Dream</em> one might argue that dreams are not as vivid or
coherent as waking experiences (Austin 1946, Leite 2011, Maddy 2017)
or that &ldquo;an interpretation of dreams presupposes thoughts in a
wakeful state&rdquo; (Burge 1986a, p. 120, Bouswma 1949). To avoid
such concerns, one might replace &ldquo;I am dreaming&rdquo; in
argument (1)&ndash;(3) with &ldquo;an evil demon is deceiving
me&rdquo; (Descartes, <em>Meditation One</em>, last paragraph). But
the hypothesis that <em>an evil demon is deceiving me</em> attributes
mysterious, unexplained powers to the supposed evil demon. Perhaps for
these reasons, the skeptical hypotheses most widely used today are
variations on the idea that I am a bodiless brain in a vat whose
neuro-chemical receptors are stimulated by a super-computer in the
same way that the neuro-chemical receptors of an ordinary embodied
brain are stimulated.</p>

<p>
Suppose \(p\) is a statement about the world around me that I believe.
Then a skeptical hypothesis <em>H</em>, such as <em>I am
dreaming</em>, <em>an evil demon is deceiving me</em>, and <em>I am a
bodiless brain in vat</em>, is a <em>Cartesian skeptical
hypothesis</em> only if</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(C1)</dt>
<dd>The fact that I believe that \(p\) is compatible with
<em>H</em>.</dd>
<dt>(C2)</dt>
<dd>If <em>H</em> then I do not know that \(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For any statement \(p\) about the world around me that I believe and
every hypothesis <em>H</em> that satisfies (C1) and (C2) for my belief
that \(p\), there is a corresponding Cartesian skeptical argument of
the form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If I know that \(p\), then I know that not <em>H</em>.
<br />
I do not know that not <em>H</em>.
<br />
Therefore, I do not know that \(p\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Arguments of this form are designed &ldquo;to convince us, on the
basis of assumptions we ourselves hold, that all or a large part of
our claims about the empirical world cannot amount to knowledge&rdquo;
(Putnam 1994: 284).</p>

<h2 id="CarAssEpiPosThoCon">2. Cartesian assumptions: epistemic possibility and thought content</h2>

<p>
To construct a Cartesian skeptical argument one needs to formulate a
skeptical hypothesis <em>H</em> that satisfies (C1) and (C2) for all
or a very large number of statements about the empirical world that
one believes. A hypothesis <em>H</em> satisfies constraint (C1) for an
empirical statement \(p\) that I believe only if</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(M)</dt>
<dd>The content of my belief that \(p\) would be the same whether or
not <em>H</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It may seem easy to construct Cartesian hypotheses that satisfy (M)
for any statement about the empirical world that one believes. For
when one imagines a situation in which one&rsquo;s sensory surfaces
would be affected in the same way they are in the actual world but
one&rsquo;s actual beliefs would be radically mistaken, as in a
standard Cartesian brain-in-a-vat hypothesis, it is tempting to infer
that in the imagined situation one&rsquo;s belief contents would be
the same as one&rsquo;s belief contents in the actual world (Blackburn
1984: 312; Searle 1983: 230). CE implies that such inferences may lead
to false conclusions: our belief contents are not guaranteed to be the
same in every environment in which our sensory surfaces are affected
in the same as they are in the actual world (Burge 1986a: 123). CE
therefore implies that some traditional efforts to formulate skeptical
hypotheses fail to satisfy (M) and hence also fail to satisfy (C1)
(Falvey &amp; Owens 1994: 121).</p>

<p>
This observation sets part of the framework for debates in the
literature about whether CE is compatible with the Cartesian skeptical
intuition that we may actually be in any one of our subjectively
equivalent worlds. The debates take for granted that
&ldquo;conceptualization on any considerable scale is inseparable from
language&rdquo; (Quine 1960: 3). They also assume that arguments for
<em>semantic</em> externalism (SE)&mdash;roughly the thesis that the
referents and satisfaction conditions of a person&rsquo;s words and
the associated truth conditions of the person&rsquo;s utterances are
partly determined by facts about the person&rsquo;s social or physical
environments&mdash;are a basis for, though distinct from, arguments
for CE. The details of the debates depend on which varieties of SE and
CE are under discussion. The next section presents the standard
definitions of SE and CE and summarizes the varieties of SE and CE
whose consequences for skepticism are the topic of sections 6 and 7 of
this entry.</p>

<h2 id="SemExtConExt">3. Semantic externalism and content externalism</h2>

<h3 id="PreDef">3.1 Preliminary definitions</h3>

<p>
Semantic externalism (SE) and content externalism (CE) are defined in
terms of &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; psychological states, namely, the
physiological and functional states and processes of a person&rsquo;s
brain and/or body that can be described without using any semantical
terms, without specifying the contents expressed by the states, and
without mentioning any conditions beyond the person&rsquo;s bodily
surfaces (Putnam 1975a; Burge 1979, 1986a; Farkas 2006; Haukioja
2017):</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Semantic Internalism</strong> (aka semantic individualism):
The referents and satisfaction conditions of a person&rsquo;s words
and the associated truth conditions of the person&rsquo;s utterances
are entirely determined by (supervene on) the person&rsquo;s narrow
psychological states.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Content Internalism</strong> (aka content individualism): The
contents of a person&rsquo;s beliefs and other mental
attitudes&mdash;the mental states we describe by using sentences
containing &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses, such as &ldquo;Alex believes
that water is wet&rdquo;&mdash; are entirely determined by (supervene
on) the person&rsquo;s narrow psychological states.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Semantic Externalism</strong> (aka semantic
anti-individualism) is the negation of semantic internalism: The
referents and satisfaction conditions of a person&rsquo;s words and
the associated truth conditions of the person&rsquo;s utterances are
not entirely determined by (do not supervene on) the person&rsquo;s
narrow psychological states.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Content Externalism</strong> (aka content anti-individualism)
is the negation of content internalism: The contents of a
person&rsquo;s beliefs and other mental attitudes are not entirely
determined by (do not supervene on) the person&rsquo;s narrow
psychological states.</p>

<p>
Theories of SE and CE also imply that the semantics of our words and
the contents of our thoughts depend on our environment. The several
varieties of SE and CE that have been influential in the literature
fall into two main groups: <em>singular</em> SE and CE, and
<em>general</em> SE and CE.</p>

<h3 id="SinSemConExt">3.2 Singular semantic and content externalism</h3>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Singular semantic externalism</strong>: The referents of a
person&rsquo;s singular terms, including proper names, such as
&ldquo;Aristotle,&rdquo; demonstratives, such as &ldquo;this&rdquo;
and &ldquo;that,&rdquo; and indexicals, such as &ldquo;now&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I,&rdquo; are partly determined by causal relations that the
person bears to particular objects in the person&rsquo;s environment
or to other speakers who are causally related to particular objects in
the person&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p>
According to direct reference theories, the semantical role of a
proper name in a sentence, such as &ldquo;Aristotle was fond of
dogs,&rdquo; is to supply an object, such as Aristotle, as a
constituent of the content expressed by the sentence (Kripke 1980),
and the semantic role of a demonstrative, such as &ldquo;that,&rdquo;
as it occurs in a speaker&rsquo;s utterance of a sentence, such as
&ldquo;That is a cat,&rdquo; when the utterance is supplemented by the
speaker&rsquo;s appropriate and successful demonstration of a nearby
object <em>o</em>, such as a cat, and is to supply <em>o</em> as a
constituent of the content expressed by the utterance (Kaplan 1989:
500).</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Singular content externalism</strong>: A person&rsquo;s
singular thought contents are partly individuated by objects in the
actual environment beyond the person&rsquo;s narrow mental states.</p>

<p>
Kripke 1979 presents a puzzle about how direct reference theories are
related to singular CE. Perry 1979 and Salmon 1986 posit psychological
analogs of Fregean senses to try to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p>
Singular CE implies that a speaker who utters a sentence containing a
singular term on a given occasion may be confident that the singular
term, as the speaker uses it on that occasion, has a referent, when in
fact it does not. Such cases engender <em>illusions of singular
external thought content</em>.</p>

<h3 id="GenSemConExt">3.3 General semantic and content externalisms</h3>

<h4 id="GenSemExt">3.3.1 General semantic externalisms</h4>

<p class="indent">
<strong>General semantic externalism</strong>: The referents and
satisfaction conditions of a person&rsquo;s non-singular terms,
especially the person&rsquo;s general terms, such as
&ldquo;elm,&rdquo; are partly determined by (or supervene on) causal
relations that the person bears to objects and/or other speakers in
the person&rsquo;s physical and social environments.</p>

<p>
Singular SE and general SE are often combined, but they are logically
independent.</p>

<h5>Arguments for general semantic externalism</h5>

<p>
Kripke supports general SE by proposing that we view natural kind
terms, such as &ldquo;gold,&rdquo; as singular terms that refer to
substances. He theorizes that the referents of such singular terms of
substances and the referents of ordinary proper names are fixed in
similar ways:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the case of proper names, the reference can be fixed in various
ways. In an initial baptism it is typically fixed by an ostension or a
description. Otherwise, the reference is usually determined by a
chain, passing the name from link to link. The same observations hold
for such a general term as &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. If we imagine a
hypothetical (admittedly somewhat artificial) baptism of the
substance, we must imagine it picked out by some such
&ldquo;definition&rdquo; as, &ldquo;Gold is the substance instantiated
by the items over there, or at any rate, by almost all of them&rdquo;.
(Kripke 1980: 135)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this version of general SE, satisfaction conditions for the
predicate &ldquo;is gold&rdquo; must be defined in terms of the
substance <em>gold</em>, roughly as follows: &ldquo;is gold&rdquo; is
satisfied by an object <em>x</em> if and only if <em>x</em> is an
instance of <em>gold</em> (Soames 2005: 58).</p>

<p>
Putnam describes ostensive definitions of kind terms such as
&ldquo;water&rdquo; without referring to a substance, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose I point to a glass of water and say &ldquo;this liquid is
called water&rdquo;&hellip;. My &ldquo;ostensive definition&rdquo; of
water has the following empirical presupposition: that the body of
liquid I am pointing to bears a certain sameness relation (say,
<em>x</em> is the same liquid as <em>y</em>, or <em>x</em> is the
same<em><sub>L</sub></em> as <em>y</em>) to most of the stuff I and
other speakers in my linguistic community have on other occasions
called &ldquo;water&rdquo;. (Putnam 1975a: 225)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this version of general SE, &ldquo;&lsquo;water&rsquo; refers to
water&rdquo; is short for &ldquo;<em>x</em> satisfies &lsquo;is
water&rsquo; if and only if <em>x</em> is water&rdquo; (Putnam 1976b:
190). The sense in which the kind term &ldquo;water&rdquo;
<em>rigidly</em> refers to water, is that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(For every world <em>W</em>) (for every <em>x</em> in <em>W</em>)
(<em>x</em> is water if and only if <em>x</em> bears
<em>same<sub>L</sub></em> to the entity referred to as
&lsquo;this&rsquo; <em>in the actual world W</em><sub>1</sub>) (Putnam
1975a: 231)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kripke and Putnam argue that if water is H<sub>2</sub>O, as we
believe, then in any possible world in which there is water, it is
H<sub>2</sub>O. (As Putnam later notes, &ldquo;Normal water is
actually a quantum mechanical superposition of H<sub>2</sub>O,
H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> &hellip; Very
little (if any) water is simply H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; (Putnam 2013:
198n10). To save words below, I&rsquo;ll use
&ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; to denote these quantum states.)</p>

<p>
Kripke and Putnam both emphasize, in effect, that speakers of the same
natural language typically take one another&rsquo;s words at face
value and evaluate their utterances accordingly, even when they know
very little about the topics their utterances concern. Putnam devised
his method of constructing Twin Earth thought experiments to highlight
the semantic consequences of accepting this observation about our
ordinary linguistic practices. In his best-known Twin Earth thought
experiment (Putnam 1975a: 223&ndash;225), Putnam imagines Oscar, who
(a) lives on Earth and (b) does not know that water is H<sub>2</sub>O
but (c) is competent enough in the use of the English word
&ldquo;water&rdquo; that his fellow English speakers take his uses of
&ldquo;water&rdquo; at face value, and (d) would defer to a chemist on
Earth who tells him that water is H<sub>2</sub>O. Putnam judges and
invites us to agree, that Oscar&rsquo;s word &ldquo;water&rdquo; is
true of <em>x</em> if and only if <em>x</em> is water, and that when
Oscar says, while pointing at a liquid in a glass, &ldquo;That is
water,&rdquo; his utterance is true if and only if the liquid in the
glass is water. Putnam then describes a narrow psychological twin of
Oscar&rsquo;s, Toscar, who lives on Twin Earth, which is exactly like
Earth except that wherever there is H<sub>2</sub>O on Earth there is a
different liquid, whose molecular structure, XYZ, is very different
from the molecular structure of H<sub>2</sub>O, but whose superficial
qualifies are similar to those of water at normal pressures and
temperatures. Putnam judges and invites us to agree that since XYZ
does not bear the appropriate same<em><sub>L</sub></em> relation to
the portions of liquid that we call &ldquo;water&rdquo; on Earth, XYZ
is not water, but another liquid that we may call twater. He infers
that Toscar&rsquo;s word &ldquo;water&rdquo; is true of <em>x</em> if
and only if <em>x</em> is twater and that when Toscar says, while
pointing at a liquid in a glass, &ldquo;That is water,&rdquo; his
utterance is true if and only if the liquid in the glass is twater.
Putnam concludes that the truth conditions of Oscar&rsquo;s and
Toscar&rsquo;s utterances of sentences containing the term
&ldquo;water&rdquo; are not determined by their narrow psychological
states. In a final step he argues that this was true even in 1750,
before chemists on Earth or Twin Earth discovered the chemical
structures of water and twater.</p>

<h5>Illusions of reference for general terms</h5>

<p>
When we use a proper name, we presuppose that it has a referent.
Similarly, when we use a natural kind term, we presuppose that there
are structural properties that are common to all the things to which
we and others in our community apply the term. This similarity has led
many philosophers (Schwartz 1977; Devitt &amp; Sterelny 1987; Brown
2004; Hacking 2007; Wikforss 2013) to conclude that just as a singular
term may fail to refer to anything due to a false presupposition, so a
natural kind term may fail to have satisfaction conditions due to a
false presupposition. A corollary is that just as a speaker may be
under an illusion that a given proper name or a given use of a
demonstrative refers to an object, so a speaker may be under an
illusion that a natural kind term has satisfaction conditions. This
conclusion and corollary result in a <em>presuppositional theory of
general SE</em>.</p>

<p>
An equally influential view is that natural kind terms are not
analogous to proper names in this way. Putnam 1962b argues, for
instance, that we can make sense of discovering that cats are not
animals, but automata, and Kripke (1980: 122) agrees. If we can make
sense of discovering that cats are automata, then our word
&ldquo;cat&rdquo; may be true of (satisfied by) the very
things&mdash;automata as it turns out&mdash;that we have called cats
all along, even if our presupposition that &ldquo;cat&rdquo; is a
natural kind term is false. Putnam thinks we can also make sense of
discovering that a term such as &ldquo;pencil,&rdquo; which we believe
to be an artifact term, is in fact a natural kind term. In short, we
may discover that a term we take to be a natural kind term is an
artifact term, and we may discover that a term we take to be an
artifact term is a natural kind term, without concluding that the
terms do not refer (Putnam 1975a: 240&ndash;242). This <em>holistic
theory of general SE</em> is shaped by a commitment to epistemological
holism, according to which any (or almost any) statement may be
challenged and perhaps revised without changing the satisfaction
conditions of the general terms that occur in it (Quine 1951; Putnam
1962a; Burge 1986b; Williamson 2007).</p>

<h4 id="GenConExt">3.3.2 General content externalisms</h4>

<p class="indent">
<strong>General content externalism</strong>: The contents of a
person&rsquo;s general (non-singular) thoughts, such as <em>Elms are
deciduous trees</em>, especially (but not exclusively) the parts of a
person&rsquo;s general contents that are expressed by the
person&rsquo;s uses of general terms, such as &ldquo;elm,&rdquo; are
partly determined by causal relations that the person bears to objects
and/or other speakers in the person&rsquo;s physical or social
environments.</p>

<p>
Singular CE and general CE are often combined, but they are logically
independent.</p>

<h5>Arguments for general content externalism</h5>

<p>
The above arguments for general SE leave it open whether they can be
extended to support general CE. McGinn 1977 suggests this extension.
Burge 1979 argues in detail that our default practices of taking
others&rsquo; words at face value is of a piece with our ordinary ways
of attributing beliefs and thoughts to other speakers. This
clarification of the consequences of SE seems inevitable in
retrospect. If my local arborist says, for instance, &ldquo;There are
elm trees in Bloomington,&rdquo; in taking his utterance of these
words at face value I thereby also take him to have said and to have
expressed the thought that <em>there are elm trees in
Bloomington</em>. One can accept this observation without supposing
that language is prior to thought, or vice versa. The notions of
reference, linguistic meaning, and thought may be &ldquo;interwoven in
complex ways which render it impossible fully to analyze one in terms
of the other&rdquo; (Burge 1986b: 718; see also Williamson 2007:
Ch.1).</p>

<h5>Illusions of content expressed by general terms</h5>

<p>
On the presuppositional theory of general SE, if there are no
structural properties that are common to all the things to which we
apply a term T that we take to be a natural kind term, then the term
fails to be true of anything. In these circumstances, a person who is
unaware of the reference failure and tries to express a thought
content by using a sentence that contains T fails to express any
content at all. Such situations generate <em>illusions of content
expressed by general terms</em>. Illusions of this sort, and the
resulting <em>presuppositional theory of general CE</em>, are central
to some of the debates discussed in section 6 below.</p>

<p>
An equally influential variety of general CE implies that
&ldquo;Nearly anything can be topic of nonstandard theorizing&rdquo;
(Burge 1986b: 709). We may theorize, for instance, that cats are
automata while knowing that others believe that cats are animals. The
discovery that cats are automata would not, on this <em>holistic
theory of general CE</em>, engender illusions of content expressed by
the general term &ldquo;cat.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="ConExtEpiPos">4. Content externalism and epistemic possibility</h2>

<p>
Both presuppositional and holistic theories of general CE make it
difficult to formulate some of our commonsense judgments about what is
epistemically possible. For instance, suppose that, as we believe,
elms and beeches are different species of tree. Then according to
general CE, in a way that is mirrored in SE by the rigidity of the
satisfaction conditions for &ldquo;elm&rdquo; and &ldquo;beech,&rdquo;
elms can&rsquo;t be beeches: there is no possible world in which elms
trees are beech trees. Before I learned that elm trees are not beech
trees, however, it was in some sense &ldquo;epistemically
possible&rdquo; for me that elm trees are beech trees. I cannot
analyze this sense of epistemic possibility in terms of a possible
world in which elm trees are beech trees, since I have now learned
elms are not beech trees and I therefore believe there is no such
possible world.</p>

<p>
In non-skeptical contexts the standard solution to this problem is
roughly to say that given our sensory evidence, there is a
&ldquo;qualitatively identical epistemic situation&rdquo; in which the
references of some of our words differ in such a way that the content
we express by our utterances of &ldquo;elm trees are beech
trees&rdquo; is true. More precisely,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that in the actual world \(w_1\), at a given time \(t\),</p>

<ul>

<li>speaker \(A\) uses a sentence \(S\) to express content \(p\), on
the basis of \(A\)&rsquo;s sensory evidence \(E,\)</li>

<li>the negation of \(S\) is true in \(w_1\), and</li>

<li>speaker A lacks sufficient evidence to judge responsibly that the
negation of \(S\) is true in \(w_1\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then it is &ldquo;epistemically possible<sub>K</sub>&rdquo; that \(p\)
for speaker \(A\) with sensory evidence \(E\) at time \(t\) if and
only if there exists a counterfactual possible world \(w_2\) in
which</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>There exists an epistemic counterpart \(A^*\) of \(A\) whose
sensory evidence \(E\) and linguistic behavior up to and including
time \(t\) are the same as \(A\)&rsquo;s,</li>

<li>\(A^*\)&rsquo;s utterances of sentence \(S\) express a true
content \(q\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
(The subscript &ldquo;K&rdquo; in &ldquo;epistemically
possible<sub>K</sub>&rdquo; refers to Kripke, who first sketched this
analysis in Kripke 1980 [103&ndash;104]. For applications of the same
sort of analysis, see Block &amp; Stalnaker 1999: 6&ndash;7; Putnam
1990: 62; and Yablo 2008: 185&ndash;188.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To apply this analysis to the commonsense judgment that it was once
epistemically possible for me that elm trees are beech trees, the
content \(q\) cannot be that <em>elm trees are beech trees</em>. In
many other cases, however, the content \(q\) need not differ from the
content \(p\) for it to be &ldquo;epistemically
possible<sub>K</sub>&rdquo; that \(p\) for speaker \(A\) with sensory
evidence E at time \(t\). In 2018 it was &ldquo;epistemically
possible<sub>K</sub>&rdquo; for me that <em>there are no Asian Carp in
Lake Michigan</em>. I now know that there are Asian Carp in Lake
Michigan and that they have been there since 2010. If, as I believe,
it is a contingent fact that there are Asian Carp in Lake Michigan,
then there is a counterfactual possible world in which my evidence in
2018 was the same as my evidence in 2018 in the actual world, but my
utterances of &ldquo;There are no Asian Carp in Lake Michigan&rdquo;
express the <em>true</em> content that <em>there are no Asian Carp in
Lake Michigan</em>. Cases of this second type are also important to
the debates discussed in sections 6 and 7 below.</p>

<h2 id="CenDilForConExtSkeCon">5. The central dilemma for content externalism in skeptical contexts</h2>

<p>
When we solve the problem explained in section 4 by analyzing
epistemic possibility as epistemically possible<sub>K</sub>, we apply
a method that is structurally similar to the method we use to
construct Twin Earth cases that support CE: we hold constant some of a
person&rsquo;s physical and mental states, including the
person&rsquo;s &ldquo;qualitative epistemic situation,&rdquo; while
stipulating that his environment differs from his actual environment
in ways that imply that his thought contents differ from his thought
contents in the actual world. In contexts in which skepticism is not
at issue, this method has convinced many philosophers to accept both
CE and the thesis that one&rsquo;s sensory experiences are determined
by one&rsquo;s narrow psychological states. When one considers the
method in skeptical contexts, however, this combination of views is
puzzling.</p>

<p>
The puzzle arises because the method enables us to describe, for each
of us, any number of subjectively equivalent worlds in which our
sensory surfaces are affected in the same way, we express our beliefs
and thoughts by using sentence tokens with the same syntactic shapes,
but the beliefs and thoughts we thereby express differ from our actual
beliefs and thoughts (Ebbs 1996: 510; see also Blackburn 1984: 312, on
&ldquo;spinning the possible worlds&rdquo;). Our descriptions of these
worlds appear to imply that from our subjective, first-person point of
view, we cannot discriminate between them. We therefore seem to
face</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt><strong>The Central Dilemma</strong>:</dt>
<dd>

<p>
Either:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>First horn</em>. We do not know without empirical investigation
the contents of the thoughts we express by using our sentences, since
we do not know without empirical investigation which of our
subjectively equivalent worlds we are in, and the contents of the
thoughts we express by using our sentences are not the same in all our
subjectively equivalent worlds.</p>

<p>
or</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Second horn</em>. We know without empirical investigation the
contents of the thoughts we express by using our sentences, and from
this knowledge we can infer that we are not in any of our subjectively
equivalent worlds in which the contents of the thoughts we express by
using our sentences differ from what we know them to be.</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The first horn is incompatible with our ordinary assumption that we
each have <em>minimal self-knowledge</em>&mdash;we each know without
empirical investigation what thoughts our own utterances express. The
second horn conflicts with the Cartesian skeptical intuition that we
may actually be in any one of our subjectively equivalent worlds.</p>

<p>
Content externalists typically reject the first horn. They note, for
instance, that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[W]hatever fixes the content of the first-order belief that I express
by saying &ldquo;There is water in the glass&rdquo; also fixes in the
same way the embedded content in the second-order belief I express by
saying &ldquo;I believe there is water in the glass&rdquo;. (Shoemaker
1994: 260n7; see also Davidson 1988: 664)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some content externalists (Gibbons 1996; Brown 2004) argue that such
second-order beliefs are knowledge if they are true in a contextually
relevant range of circumstances. Other content externalists (Burge
1988; Wright 1994; Ebbs 1996; Goldberg 2002) argue that the key to
reconciling our ordinary assumption that we have minimal
self-knowledge with CE lies not in the reliability of our second-order
beliefs about the contents of our thoughts, phenomenological signs, or
empirical investigation, but in our activity of thinking and
self-ascribing our own thoughts. See the entry on
 <a href="../self-knowledge-externalism/">externalism and self-knowledge</a>
 for details.</p>

<p>
The rest of the present entry grants that minimal self-knowledge is
compatible with CE. The entry focuses on the second horn of the
central dilemma, revisiting the first horn only as needed to assess
debates about the second horn. It is this horn that forces us to
confront (Q), namely,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Is the Cartesian skeptical intuition that we may actually be in any
one of our subjectively equivalent worlds compatible with CE despite
appearances to the contrary, or, if not, are there reformulations of
the intuition that are compatible with CE and enable us to formulate
challenging Cartesian skeptical arguments?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="ConExtKnoOneExtEnv">6. Content externalism and knowledge of one&rsquo;s external environment</h2>

<p>
McKinsey 1991 challenges content externalists to explain how they can
consistently accept three claims to which they are apparently
committed, namely,</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>Oscar knows independently of empirical investigation that he is
thinking that water is wet.</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>The proposition that Oscar is thinking that water is wet
conceptually implies E.</dd>
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>The proposition E cannot be known independently of empirical
investigation.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
where E is a proposition describing &ldquo;the relations that Oscar
bears to other speakers or objects in his external environment&rdquo;
(McKinsey 1991: 10). To say that the proposition that <em>Oscar is
thinking that water is wet</em> &ldquo;conceptually implies&rdquo; a
proposition E, according to McKinsey, is to say that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is a correct deduction of [E] from [the proposition that
<em>Oscar is thinking that water is wet</em>], a deduction whose only
premisses other than [the proposition that <em>Oscar is thinking that
water is wet</em>] are necessary or conceptual truths that are
knowable a priori, and each of whose steps follows from previous lines
by a self-evident inference rule of some adequate system of natural
deduction. (McKinsey 1991: 14, with the bracketed substitutions for
\(p\) and \(q\))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
McKinsey reasons that if (1) and (2) are true, then contrary to (3)
one can know a proposition E describing &ldquo;the relations that
Oscar bears to other speakers or objects in his external
environment&rdquo; without empirical investigation.</p>

<p>
To support (3) McKinsey points out that CE is defined in terms of
narrow and wide psychological states. He calls these notions Cartesian
because</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a narrow state should be (roughly) a state from which the existence of
external objects cannot be <em>deduced</em>, and a wide state would be
one from which the existence of external objects <em>can</em> be
deduced. (McKinsey 1991: 14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this he infers (on page 16)</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(*)</dt>
<dd>One cannot know a priori that there are external objects in each
of one&rsquo;s subjectively equivalent worlds (worlds in which
one&rsquo;s narrow psychological states are the same as they are in
the actual world).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
McKinsey 1991 concludes that a content externalist who accepts (1) and
(2) is thereby also committed to accepting (3), which is incompatible
with (*). This is a sharpened and strengthened version of the second
horn of the Central Dilemma explained in section 5.</p>

<h3 id="GenConExtConImp">6.1 General content externalism and conceptual implication</h3>

<p>
One way to evaluate McKinsey&rsquo;s challenge is to ask whether a
content externalist is committed to accepting a proposition of the
form (2), where E is a proposition describing relations that Oscar
bears to other speakers or objects in his external environment
(Brueckner 1992a: 113). As a candidate for E, McKinsey may have had
something like the following proposition in mind (from Brueckner
1992a: 112):</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(E1)</dt>
<dd>Oscar inhabits an environment containing H<sub>2</sub>O and not
XYZ.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The problem with this candidate for E is that on a holistic theory of
CE, as Burge explains,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
An individual or community might (logically speaking) have been wrong
in thinking that there was such a thing as water. It is epistemically
possible&mdash;it might have turned out&mdash;that contrary to an
individual&rsquo;s belief, water did not exist. (Burge 1982: 97)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We may read &ldquo;epistemically possible&rdquo; here as
&ldquo;epistemically possible<sub>K</sub>,&rdquo; as the continuation
of the passage makes clear:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Part of what we do when we conceive of such cases is to rely on actual
circumstances in which these illusions do not hold&mdash;rely on the
actual existence of water&mdash;in order to individuate the notions we
cite in specifying the propositional attitudes. We utilize&mdash;must
utilize, I think&mdash; the actual existence of physical stuffs and
things, or of other speakers or thinkers, in making sense of
counter-factual projections in which we think at least some of these
surroundings away. (Burge 1982: 97)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Applying this method we may describe counterfactual worlds in which
(a) Oscar&rsquo;s sensory experiences are the same as they are in the
actual world, and (b) there is no water, and (c) either Oscar&rsquo;s
linguistic community theorizes that water is H<sub>2</sub>O or Oscar
himself does so, and (d) Oscar&rsquo;s uses, whether in thought or
speech, of &ldquo;water is wet&rdquo; express the same contents that
they actually express (Burge 1982: 98). (Clause (d) would be true, for
instance, if Oscar or some members of his linguistic community are
causally related to instances of hydrogen and oxygen, so that the
compound expression H<sub>2</sub>O has the same content for Oscar as
it has for us.)</p>

<p>
The reasoning just sketched supports the conclusion that Oscar cannot
know (E1) without empirical investigation. It also supports (N):</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(N)</dt>
<dd>It is necessary that if Oscar is thinking that water is wet, then
one of the following must be the case: (i) water exists, or (ii) Oscar
theorizes that H<sub>2</sub>O exists, or (iii) Oscar is part of a
community of speakers some of whom theorize that H<sub>2</sub>O
exists. (Brueckner 1992a: 116)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The above argument for (N) relies on &ldquo;the actual existence of
water&hellip;in order to individuate the notions we cite in specifying
the propositional attitudes&rdquo; (Burge 1982: 97), however, and
therefore does not establish or presuppose that CE conceptually
implies (N) (Brueckner 1992a: 116).</p>

<p>
If the holistic theory of CE that leads to these conclusions is
correct, there may be a sound argument for the conclusion that in each
of our subjectively equivalent worlds there exists some physical
objects (Brueckner 1992a: 118). Although such an argument would
challenge (*), it would be compatible with the Cartesian intuition
that we may actually be in any of our subjectively equivalent worlds
and would therefore evade the second horn.</p>

<h3 id="AtoNatKinConPriKno">6.2 Atomic natural kind concepts and a priori knowledge</h3>

<p>
Some content externalists (e.g. McGinn 1989) accept (C)</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(C)</dt>
<dd>If the concept of X is an atomic, natural kind concept, then it is
metaphysically impossible to possess it unless one has causally
interacted with instances of X.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Suppose that (C) and the presuppositional theory of general content
externalism (section 3.3.2) are true solely in virtue of conceptual
implications (section 6.1) and that one can know without empirical
investigation that one has the concept <em>water</em>. Then one will
be tempted to suppose that a person who has no views about the
chemical structure of water may infer, on purely a priori grounds,
i.e. independently of empirical investigation, that water exists, as
follows (from Boghossian 1997 [1998: 275], with numerals changed to
letters and the order of the premises switched):</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(a)</dt>
<dd>I have the concept water.</dd>
<dt>(b)</dt>
<dd>If I have the concept water, then water exists.</dd>
<dt>(c)</dt>
<dd>Water exists.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The key question is whether one can know that (b) a priori. (C)
implies that if water is an atomic natural kind concept, then (b) is
true. But this does not show that one can know that (b) a priori. A
holistic general content externalist who accepts (C) may reject the
claim that one can know that (b) a priori if (as McLaughlin &amp; Tye
1998: 311, argue) they can make sense of accepting</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>i.</dt>
<dd>We can know a priori that we have the concept of water, even if
the concept of water is an atomic, natural kind concept,</dd>
</dl>

<p>
while rejecting</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>ii.</dt>
<dd>We can know a priori that the concept of water is an atomic
natural kind concept.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The key point is that on some holistic theories of general CE, whether
a concept is atomic depends on external factors and therefore cannot
be known a priori (McLaughlin &amp; Tye 1998: 311). To see why,
suppose Oscar is minimally competent in the use of the linguistic
expression &ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; in English, while not
realizing that in English &ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; is semantically
complex and expresses a complex (non-atomic) concept. By the standards
of CE, Oscar&rsquo;s uses of &ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; express a
complex concept, even though Oscar is unaware of this fact. Now
suppose that on Twin Earth, &ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; expresses an
atomic concept, and Toscar, whose narrow states are the same as
Oscar&rsquo;s, is minimally competent in the use of
&ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; in Twin-English. By the standards of CE,
Toscar&rsquo;s uses of &ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; express an atomic
concept. This thought experiment (from Korman 2006: 514&ndash;515) and
others like it imply that one cannot know a priori whether a given
concept that one has is atomic.</p>

<h3 id="TraWar">6.3 Transmission of warrant</h3>

<p>
Another line of inquiry grants that by reflecting on the arguments for
CE one can know that (a) and (b) (of section 6.2) &ldquo;without
empirical investigation&rdquo; but denies that I may infer, without
relying on any additional premises, that (c), and thereby come to know
that (c) without empirical investigation. This line of inquiry
accepts</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Closure for (a)&ndash;(c)</em>. If I know that (a) and I know that
(b) [i.e. if (a) then (c)], then I know that (c).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The focus of the inquiry is not on Closure for (a)&ndash;(c), but on a
corresponding principle regarding justifiable inferences, understood
as <em>changes in view</em> (Harman 1986):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Warrant Transmission for (a)&ndash;(c)</em>. If I know that (a)
and (b) without empirical investigation, then I may infer, without
relying on any additional premises, that (c), and thereby come to know
that (c) without empirical investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Against Warrant Transmission for (a)&ndash;(c) one might reason as
follows. Suppose I know that (a) &ldquo;without empirical
investigation&rdquo; yet also without ruling out the empirical
possibility that my word &ldquo;water&rdquo; fails to express a
concept due to the falsity of my presupposition that there are
structural properties that are common to all the things to which I and
others apply &ldquo;water&rdquo; (see section 3.3.2 above on the
presupposition theory of general CE). Suppose also that I know that
(b) without empirical investigation. Since (a) and (b) logically imply
(c), given Closure for (a)&ndash;(c), I know that (c). I nevertheless
do not know that (c) solely based on my knowledge that (a) and (b) and
my knowledge that (a) and (b) logically imply (c). The reason is that
my knowledge that (a)&mdash;my knowledge that I have the concept of
water&mdash;was acquired by my being in a state which is subjectively
indistinguishable from being in a different state in a different world
in which, due to facts about my external environment in that world
about which I am ignorant, my word &ldquo;water&rdquo; does not
express a concept at all. This argument against Warrant Transmission
for (a)&ndash;(c) is due in essentials to M. Davies 1998 and Wright
2000. It implies that a necessary condition of my coming to know that
(a) without empirical investigation is that I <em>already</em>, and
<em>independently</em>, know that (c). (Wright 1985 applies an earlier
version of the same basic strategy to explain &ldquo;the intuitive
inadequacy of G. E. Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;proof of the existence of the
external world&rsquo;&rdquo; [1985: 434].)</p>

<p>
One might object that this type of criticism of Warrant Transmission
for (a)&ndash;(c) &ldquo;rests on an internalist epistemology that
would be rejected by epistemological externalism&rdquo; (Brown 2004:
251). On a reliabilist account of knowledge (Goldman 1976), I may know
that (a) and (b), infer, without relying on any additional premises,
that (c), and thereby come to know that (c), if the sorts of
subjectively equivalent situations that are incompatible with my
knowing these propositions are not relevant to assessing whether my
acceptance of them is reliable in the sense required for
knowledge.</p>

<p>
This objection is not decisive if one accepts a contextualist
explanation of the failure of Warrant Transmission for (a)&ndash;(c)
with the following two parts. First, in ordinary contexts the
epistemic possibility that there is no water is not relevant to
whether or not I know that (a), so I can know &ldquo;without empirical
inquiry&rdquo; that (a) in such contexts. Second, in a context in
which I claim to know that (c) without empirical inquiry, the
possibility that (c) is false is relevant and must be ruled out for me
to know (c) without empirical inquiry (M. Davies 1998, 358&ndash;359).
This explanation of why Warrant Transmission for (a)&ndash;(c) fails
is compatible with a reliabilist account of my knowledge that (a) and
is therefore not vulnerable to the criticism in the previous
paragraph. It also suggests that the initial appearance that there is
a transmission of warrant for (a)&ndash;(c) is based on an
equivocation on the meaning of &ldquo;know without empirical
investigation.&rdquo; I may &ldquo;know that (a) without empirical
investigation&rdquo; if I presuppose (c) and I am in fact able to
express the thought that, say, water is wet, simply by using my
sentence &ldquo;water is wet&rdquo; without engaging in any empirical
investigation beyond those I have already completed. But I cannot know
(c) without empirical investigation in this way.</p>

<p>
One might also reject the supposition that one can derive knowledge
that (b) solely from one&rsquo;s a priori knowledge of CE. If one
accepts a holistic theory of CE, one might argue that the sort of
knowledge we have of our own thoughts without empirical investigation
does not yield any substantive knowledge of the &ldquo;individuation
conditions&rdquo; of those thoughts, hence does not yield knowledge
that (b) (Raffman 1998).</p>

<h3 id="KnoOneEnvWitEmpInv">6.4 On knowing one&rsquo;s environment without empirical investigation</h3>

<p>
Despite the arguments reviewed in sections 6.1&ndash;6.3, one might
argue that one can know a truth about one&rsquo;s environment
&ldquo;via introspection and conceptual analysis&rdquo; (Sawyer 1998:
525, with Arabic numerals changed to letters) by reasoning as
follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(d)</dt>
<dd>I am thinking a <em>water</em>-thought.</dd>
<dt>(e)</dt>
<dd>If I am thinking a <em>water</em>-thought, then I&rsquo;m in a
water-world.</dd>
<dt>(f)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, I am in a water-world.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
where a &ldquo;water-thought&rdquo; is a thought, such as the thought
that <em>water is wet</em>, that contains or involves the concept
<em>water</em>, and a subject is in a &ldquo;water-world&rdquo; if and
only if &ldquo;either the subject&rsquo;s environment contains water
and water is a natural kind, or the subject is part of a community
which has the concept of water, whether or not water is a natural
kind&rdquo; (Sawyer 1998: 525). The argument (d)&ndash;(e) is clearly
valid. Premise (d) follows from our having minimal self-knowledge on a
given occasion when we are thinking that water is wet. And some
philosophers (Sawyer 1998; Warfield 1998) argue that we can know (e)
without empirical investigation, hence by conceptual analysis alone.
These philosophers in effect claim that the antecedent of (e), namely
(d), conceptually implies the consequent of (e), namely (f), in the
sense of &ldquo;conceptually implies&rdquo; that McKinsey 1991
defines. They conclude that CE is incompatible with (3), the standard
view that one cannot know about one&rsquo;s external environment
without empirical investigation. As Sawyer later observes, however,
&ldquo;the heart of the so-called &lsquo;McKinsey
paradox&rsquo;&rdquo; is that an argument of the sort developed by
Sawyer 1998 &ldquo;seems to provide an implausibly quick response to
the external world skeptic&rdquo; (Sawyer 2015: 75).</p>

<h3 id="SinConExtPriKnoWor">6.5 Singular content externalism and a priori knowledge of the world</h3>

<p>
Sections 6.2&ndash;6.4 focused on the consequences of general CE.
Singular CE raises different but related puzzles about whether one can
have a priori knowledge of one&rsquo;s environment. To see why,
suppose Suzy utters the sentence, &ldquo;That is poisonous,&rdquo;
while pointing at a snake named Fred, thereby expressing her thought
that <em>that [i.e. Fred] is poisonous</em>. According to the direct
reference theory of demonstratives (due to Kaplan 1989, see section
3.1 above), the content of the thought Suzy thereby expresses is a
singular proposition that contains Fred, the snake, and the property
of being poisonous. Suzy might have been subject to an
<em>illusion</em> of demonstrating a particular snake when in fact
there was no snake to refer to. It therefore seems that Suzy cannot
know a priori that Suzy is thinking <em>that [Fred] is poisonous</em>,
or that <em>that [Fred]</em> exists. But consider the following
proposition:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(**)</dt>
<dd>If Suzy is thinking that <em>that [Fred] is poisonous</em> then
<em>that [Fred]</em> exists.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(**) has the form <span class="nw">&ldquo;\(Fa \supset \exists
x(x=a)\)&rdquo;.</span> Assuming the rule EG (existential
generalization) and standard axioms of identity, Suzy can therefore
infer (**) a priori. Moreover, (**) itself implies that <em>that
[Fred]</em> exists, since the proposition <em>that [Fred] is
poisonous</em> is &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; in it (Lasonen-Aarnio 2006:
441). These points imply that Suzy can know (**) a priori and that she
can infer a priori from (**) that <em>that [Fred] exists</em>. A
corollary is that privileged access to the contents of one&rsquo;s
singular thoughts is not necessary for deriving contingent existence
claims without empirical investigation (2006: 442).</p>

<p>
These inferences depend on the assumption that the logic of singular
CE is classical. In a non-classical free logic, by contrast, the form
<span class="nw">&ldquo;\(Fa \supset \exists x(x=a)\)&rdquo;</span> is
not logically valid: in cases in which &ldquo;\(a\)&rdquo; is not
assigned a reference, &ldquo;both &lsquo;\(Fa\)&rsquo; and
conditionals containing &lsquo;\(Fa\)&rsquo; have no truth value and
so are not true on those interpretations&rdquo; (McKinsey 2006: 449).
If one adopts a free logic, then if singular CE is true, privileged
access to the contents of one&rsquo;s singular thoughts is necessary
for deriving contingent existence claims without empirical
investigation.</p>

<h2 id="HypWeAlwBraVatSelRef">7. Is the hypothesis that we are always brains in vats self-refuting?</h2>

<p>
In &ldquo;Brains in a Vat&rdquo; (Putnam 1981: Ch. 1) Putnam argues
that the supposition that we are and always have been brains in vats
is &ldquo;self-refuting.&rdquo; His argument for this surprising
conclusion started a stream of illuminating literature about how to
reconstruct and evaluate it.</p>

<h3 id="FirForBIVArg">7.1 The first formulation of the BIV argument</h3>

<p>
Suppose my brain was transferred to a vat last night without my
knowledge. Then by the standards of general CE, the contents of the
thoughts I express by using my sentences would remain the same, at
least for a while. In the first several days after the transfer, and
perhaps for much longer, my utterances of &ldquo;I have hands,&rdquo;
for instance, would express the false content that <em>I have
hands</em>. (Section 7.4 discusses the epistemological consequences of
this sort of possibility.) Putnam&rsquo;s argument takes this point
for granted and considers the more extreme situation in which a
molecule-for-molecule twin of my brain exists from the beginning to
the end of its &ldquo;life&rdquo; in a vat of nutrients stimulated by
automatic machinery that &ldquo;came into existence by some kind of
cosmic chance or coincidence&rdquo; (Putnam 1981: 12). Let
&ldquo;BIV&rdquo; abbreviate this extreme situation.</p>

<p>
In an ordinary non-skeptical context, it seems obvious that we can use
the English sentence &ldquo;Are we BIVs?&rdquo; to ask ourselves,
<em>Are we BIVs?</em> and that the answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; This
complacent answer seems precarious, however, if we suppose, as many
philosophers do, that our sensory experiences would be the same
whether or not we are BIVs. For this supposition appears to imply that
our ordinary non-skeptical belief that we are not BIVs receives no
support from our sensory experiences and therefore lacks the kind of
epistemological justification we ordinarily take it to have.</p>

<p>
A BIV has never had and never will have any causal relations with
things to which English speakers apply their words, or with members of
the English-speaking community, on which the references of English
words and the contents express by utterances of English sentences
depend, according to SE and CE. If we accept CE in any of its standard
forms (see section 3 above), we are thereby committed to accepting
Putnam&rsquo;s <em>causal constraint on reference</em>, according to
which, &ldquo;One cannot refer to certain kinds of things, e.g. trees,
if one has no causal interaction at all with them, or with things in
terms of which they can be described&rdquo; (Putnam 1981: 12). The
causal constraint on reference implies that since BIVs have no causal
relations with trees, brains, or vats, or with anything in terms of
which trees, brains, or vats can be described, such brains are unable
to refer to or think about trees, brains, or vats.</p>

<p>
The causal constraint does not tell us what thoughts a BIV expresses
when it uses sentences of Vat-English, the language it speaks. Putnam
1981 suggests three possible ways of interpreting a BIV&rsquo;s basic
observational vocabulary, such as &ldquo;tree&rdquo;:
&ldquo;trees-in-the-image,&rdquo; &ldquo;electrical impulses that
cause tree experiences,&rdquo; and &ldquo;features of the program that
are responsible for those electronic impulses.&rdquo; (Putnam 1981:
14). Suppose we grant that for each of us there is a subjectively
equivalent world in which we are BIVs, and that in those subjectively
equivalent worlds our utterances may be interpreted in one of the ways
Putnam suggests. It then appears that for all we know on the basis of
our sensory experiences, we may actually in the world in which we are
BIVs and our words &ldquo;brain&rdquo; and &ldquo;vat&rdquo; are not
satisfied by brains or vats, respectively, but, instead, by (as it may
be) brains in the image and vats in the image, respectively.
Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument is meant to show that that this appearance
is self-refuting, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If we are &hellip;brains in a vat, then what we now mean by &ldquo;we
are brains in a vat&rdquo; is that we are <em>brains in a vat in the
image</em> or something of that kind (if we mean anything at all). But
part of the hypothesis that we are brains in a vat is that we are
aren&rsquo;t brains in a vat in the image (i.e. what we are
&ldquo;hallucinating&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t that we are brains in a vat).
So, if we are brains in a vat, then the sentence, &ldquo;We are brains
in a vat&rdquo; says something false (if it says anything). In short,
if we are brains in a vat, then &ldquo;We are brains in a vat&rdquo;
is false. (Putnam 1981: 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This reasoning is &ldquo;is neither &lsquo;empirical&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;a priori&rsquo;, but has elements of both ways of
investigating&rdquo;; it is based on reflections &ldquo;about what is
<em>reasonably</em> possible <em>assuming</em> certain general
premisses, or making certain broad theoretical assumptions&rdquo;
(Putnam 1981: 16). Its central premises, including the causal
constraint on reference, rest on empirical generalizations about how
ordinary English speakers interpret each other, what their words refer
to, and what thoughts they express by uttering them.</p>

<h3 id="PriRecBIVArg">7.2 A priori reconstructions of the BIV argument</h3>

<p>
Standard reconstructions of Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument nevertheless
take for granted that the goal of Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument is, or
should be, to show by strictly a priori methods that we are not BIVs
(Brueckner 1986: 160; Wright 1994: 222).</p>

<p>
Brueckner&rsquo;s reconstruction begins by stipulating that
&ldquo;brain*&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;the computer program feature
that causes experiences in the BIV that are qualitatively
indistinguishable from normal experiences that represent
brains,&rdquo; and &ldquo;vat*&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;the computer
program feature that causes experiences in the BIV that are
qualitatively indistinguishable from normal experiences that represent
vats&rdquo; (Brueckner 2011: 503). These stipulated interpretations of
the BIV&rsquo;s terms &ldquo;brain&rdquo; and &ldquo;vat&rdquo; imply
that a BIV is not a brain* in a vat* (Brueckner 2011: 503). The
reconstructed argument runs as follows:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>Either I am a BIV (speaking vat-English) or I am a non-BIV
(speaking English).</li>

<li>If I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then my utterances of
&ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; are true iff I am a brain* in a vat*.</li>

<li>If I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then I am not a brain* in a
vat*.</li>

<li>If I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then my utterances of
&ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; are not true. [b,c]</li>

<li>If I am a non-BIV (speaking English), then my utterances of
&ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; are true iff I am a BIV.</li>

<li>If I am a non-BIV (speaking English), then my utterances of
&ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; are not true. [e]</li>

<li>My utterances of &ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; are not true.</li>

<li>My utterances of &ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; are not true iff my
utterances of &ldquo;I am not a BIV&rdquo; are true.</li>

<li>My utterances of &ldquo;I am not a BIV&rdquo; are true. [g, h]
(Brueckner 2011: 503&ndash;504, with &ldquo;false&rdquo; replaced by
&ldquo;not true&rdquo;)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Brueckner notes that if I am agnostic about whether I am a BIV, then
this argument does not establish that I am not a BIV. To get to the
conclusion that I am not a BIV from (i) I need the following
premise:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(t)</dt>
<dd>My utterances of &ldquo;I am not a BIV&rdquo; are true iff I am
not a BIV.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is an instance of the following schema for specifying the
conditions under which the predicate &ldquo;true&rdquo; applies to
sentences I can use:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(T)</dt>
<dd>My utterances of &ldquo;_____&rdquo; are true iff _____.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Instances of (T), such as (t), employ what is called disquotation:
they explain the conditions under which a quoted sentence is true by
dropping the quotes and directly using the sentence. Instances of (T)
are unproblematic in most ordinary, non-skeptical contexts.</p>

<p>
If I don&rsquo;t know whether or not I am a BIV, however, it appears
that I do not know whether or not the truth conditions of my
utterances of &ldquo;I am not a BIV&rdquo; are true iff I am not a
brain* in a vat*, so I am not justified in asserting (t) (Brueckner
1986: 160; see also Stephens &amp; Russow 1985; Kinghan 1986). This
argument focuses on (t) but it also implies that I am not justified in
asserting instances of (Sat)</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>(Sat)</dt>
<dd>My word &ldquo;___&rdquo; refers to (is satisfied by) <em>x</em>
if and only if <em>x</em> is a ____.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
such as</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>(Sat<sub>brain</sub>)</dt>
<dd>My word &ldquo;brain&rdquo; refers to (is satisfied by) <em>x</em>
if and only if <em>x</em> is a brain.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
in the context of the BIV argument. For like (t),
(Sat<sub>brain</sub>) employs disquotation: it explains the conditions
under which a quoted predicate is true by dropping the quotes and
directly using the predicate. And if I don&rsquo;t know whether or not
I am a BIV, it appears that I do not know whether or not the truth
conditions of my word &ldquo;brain&rdquo; refers to (is satisfied by)
<em>x</em> if and only if <em>x</em> is a brain*, so I am not
justified in asserting (Sat<sub>brain</sub>).</p>

<p>
Against this, one might reason as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Disquotation is, on both the standard and the skeptical hypotheses, a
valid step within either English or vat-English. And surely we
don&rsquo;t need to know which of these languages we are speaking in
order to know we are speaking the one we are speaking. But that seems
to be the only thing we do need to know, in order to apply
disquotation to ourselves with confidence. (Christensen 1993: 305; see
also Hill 1990: 110n4; Wright 1994: 225)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea is that we do not suppose that we can toggle back and forth,
when considering the BIV argument, between two distinct languages,
English and Vat-English, but that <em>we can use disquotation</em>
<em>in the one language we actually speak</em>, whether we suppose it
is English or Vat-English. This reasoning motivates the a priori
reconstructions of Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument that accept
disquotation.</p>

<p>
The simplest such reconstruction was first proposed independently by
McIntyre (1984: 59&ndash;60) and Williams (1984: 261) and has since
been modified and adopted by several others (Tymoczko 1989; Brueckner
1992b and 2011; and Button 2013 and 2016). Here&rsquo;s a typical
formulation of it (Brueckner 2011: 504, with &ldquo;tree&rdquo;
replaced by &ldquo;brain&rdquo;):</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(A)</dt>
<dd>If I am a BIV, then my word &ldquo;brain&rdquo; does not refer to
brains.</dd>
<dt>(B)</dt>
<dd>My word &ldquo;brain&rdquo; refers to brains.</dd>
<dt>(C)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, I am not a BIV.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Premise (A) is a consequence of Putnam&rsquo;s causal constraint on
reference (Putnam 1981: 12). Premise (B) is an instance of (Sat). If
one accepts the defense of disquotation quoted above, it appears
plausible to suppose that it is not question-begging to accept (Sat)
when justifying premise (B) of the argument (A)&ndash;(C), but premise
(A) becomes doubtful for reasons discussed below.</p>

<p>
There are similar a priori reconstructions that do not explicitly
concern reference, such as the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(A&prime;)</dt>
<dd>If I am a BIV, then I cannot consider the question whether I am a
BIV.</dd>
<dt>(B&prime;)</dt>
<dd>I can consider the question whether I am a BIV.</dd>
<dt>(C)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, I am not a BIV.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This argument assumes that we know (B&prime;) a priori. This is not a
fundamentally new assumption, since part of the assumption that we can
apply disquotation to our own words is that we know what thoughts we
thereby express, and if this sort of knowledge is available to us a
priori, then so is knowledge of what thought we express when we use
and accept (B&prime;).</p>

<p>
One possible concern about reconstructions (A)&ndash;(C) and
(A&prime;)&ndash;(C) is that warrant for their premises does not
transmit to their conclusions (see 6.3 above). The problem about
transmission of warrant does not seem to arise for Putnam&rsquo;s BIV
argument, however, because &ldquo;there is no suggestion &hellip; that
envathood would generate illusions of content&rdquo; (Wright 2000:
159; see also Thorpe &amp; Wright 2022: 74).</p>

<p>
Another possible concern about reconstructions (A)&ndash;(C) and
(A&prime;)&ndash;(C) is that if I suspend my ordinary beliefs to the
extent of supposing I am a BIV, it is unclear why I am entitled to
accept (A), and (A&prime;). It seems that if I am reasoning strictly a
priori and accept disquotation then contrary to (A) I should accept
&ldquo;If I am a BIV, then my word &lsquo;brain&rsquo; refers to
brains.&rdquo; But this conditional is of no help in deriving (C)
given (B). For parallel reasons, (A&prime;) should be replaced by
&ldquo;If I am a BIV, then I can consider the question whether I am a
BIV&rdquo; (Ebbs 2016: 28&ndash;29; Kinghan 1986: 165).</p>

<p>
One might suppose that I can know a priori that &ldquo;Vat-English is
always something other than the language we are speaking&rdquo;
(Tymoczko 1989: 284&ndash;285). In the context of Putnam&rsquo;s BIV
argument it is not question-begging to suppose that Vat-English is the
language spoken by a brain that is always in a vat. I cannot infer a
priori from this supposition, however, that Vat-English is not the
language I speak (Brueckner 1995: 92&ndash;93; Ebbs 1996: note
32).</p>

<h3 id="ConPriRecBIVArg">7.3 Contextually a priori reconstructions of the BIV argument</h3>

<p>
A different approach to reconstructing Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument is
to accept Putnam&rsquo;s methodological claim that his BIV argument
&ldquo;is neither &lsquo;empirical&rsquo; nor &lsquo;a priori&rsquo;,
but has elements of both ways of investigating&rdquo; (Putnam 1981:
16). There are several reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>
First, CE implies that it takes empirical investigation to learn what
our words, including our words &ldquo;brain&rdquo; and
&ldquo;vat,&rdquo; refer to (are satisfied by), and, by doing so, to
learn whether there is a possible subjectively equivalent world in
which duplicates of our brains &ldquo;live&rdquo; in vats, tended by
automatic machinery. Aristotle believed that the function of the brain
is to cool the blood. It was an empirical discovery that the brain is
the center of the human nervous system. If we were to suspend our
empirical beliefs, as radical skeptics invite us to do, we would have
no basis for concluding that there is a possible subjectively
equivalent world in which duplicates of our brains &ldquo;live&rdquo;
in vats, tended by automatic machinery (Putnam 1998 [2012: 527]).</p>

<p>
Second, Putnam&rsquo;s versions of SE and CE are rooted in
observations about our actual practices of taking speakers to be
minimally competent in the use of English words. A speaker who
suspends all her empirical beliefs about what trees are and does not
affirm any demonstrative sentences that contain the word
&ldquo;tree&rdquo;, such as, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tree,&rdquo; cannot
be regarded as minimally competent in the use of the word
&ldquo;tree.&rdquo; This is not to say that to be minimally competent
in the use of &ldquo;tree&rdquo; one must be able to distinguish a
tree from every possible type of thing that looks and feels like a
tree. A speaker may count as minimally competent in the use of a word
even if all the sentences containing the word that she accepts are
false. But to be minimally competent in the use of a word one must
have some idea of what thoughts one expresses by uttering sentences
that contain the word. Without some idea of what one can use the words
to say, one is not able to use them at all (Putnam 1975a:
247&ndash;257; Ebbs 2016: 29&ndash;30).</p>

<p>
When we consider the BIV possibility we presuppose many empirical
beliefs and theories. This point about where we begin when evaluating
the argument fits well with Putnam&rsquo;s more general
<em>methodological principle</em> (MP) according to which <em>we can
do no better in our inquiries that to start in the middle, relying on
already established beliefs and inferences, and applying our best
methods for re-evaluating beliefs and inferences and arriving at new
ones</em>. (Putnam&rsquo;s commitment to this principle is evident in
Putnam 1962a, the conclusions of which, he later says, are
&ldquo;closely connected with what was later called
&lsquo;externalism&rsquo;&rdquo; (Putnam 2013: 193).)</p>

<p>
This methodological principle does not beg the question against BIV
skepticism, since it allows for the possibility of a <em>reductio</em>
<em>ad absurdum</em> of our starting assumption that our empirical
beliefs are justified (Quine 1975: 68). Assuming MP, Putnam&rsquo;s
BIV argument can be interpreted an attempt to show that the
supposition that we are BIVs is self-refuting and therefore does not
reduce our starting beliefs to absurdity.</p>

<p>
The a priori reconstructions suppose that we may be BIVs, and
Houdini-like, try to show that we are not. If we allow ourselves to
rely on our starting beliefs, we need to rethink the role of the
supposition that we are brains in vats in Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument.
Putnam compares the statement &ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; with the
statement that <em>all general statements are false</em> (Putnam 1981:
7). At first it appears that this second statement may be true or
false, and that it would take some investigation to discover what its
truth-value is, but on reflection we see that it must be false, since
the supposition that it is true yields a contradiction. Putnam also
notes that &ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; is self-refuting in something like
the way that &ldquo;I do not exist&rdquo; is self-refuting: my
utterances of &ldquo;I do not exist&rdquo; express contents that may
be evaluated as true only in contexts of evaluation that differ from
their contexts of utterance (Kaplan 1989: 495). When I utter &ldquo;I
do not exist,&rdquo; what I say is obviously false. The statement
&ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; is similarly self-refuting, according to
Putnam, but in a way that requires more reflection for me to see.</p>

<p>
These comparisons suggest that we read Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument as
follows. The supposition &ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; <em>appears</em> to
be possibly true, just as, when one first considers it, the statement
that <em>all general statements are false</em> appears to be possibly
true. On reflection, based on our background empirical beliefs about
brains and vats and the principles of SE and CE, however, we can see
that the supposition cannot be true if we are considering it, hence it
must be false. We can see that it is false not because we define the
BIV possibility as one that we are not in, but because &ldquo;the
world picture that [the skeptic] needs to give content to his talk of
computers, brains, electrical impulses, chemicals needed to keep the
brains a live, and so on is simply stolen from our world
picture&rdquo; (Putnam 1998 [2012: 527]). This version of the BIV
argument is <em>contextually a priori</em> in roughly the following
sense: if it is successful, it shows that the principles and premises
on which it relies, while not a priori in the traditional
philosophical sense, are so deeply embedded in our current theory of
the world that we cannot specify any minimally plausible way in which
they may be false. (The term &ldquo;contextually a priori&rdquo; is
from Putnam 1976a [1983: 95]. See Ebbs 2015 and Putnam 2015 for a
discussion of how to clarify it.)</p>

<p>
Arguments (A)&ndash;(C) and (A&prime;)&ndash;(C) are unproblematic if
we do not require that their premises be justified a priori. We may
instead support their premises with contextually a priori reasons that
presuppose our empirically informed &ldquo;world picture,&rdquo; so
that our starting position when considering the BIV argument is not
one of suspending all our empirical beliefs. When viewed in this way,
the arguments are successful if they show us how and why our initial
impression that we might be a BIV is not compatible with our
commitment to general CE. (See Ebbs 1992, 1996, and 2016 for a
development and defense of this interpretation of Putnam&rsquo;s BIV
argument.)</p>

<h3 id="ConForEpiPos">7.4 Consequences for epistemic possibility</h3>

<p>
Suppose one of the above reconstructions of Putnam&rsquo;s BIV
argument reconstructions is sound. Then it is not epistemically
possible<sub>K</sub> that I am a BIV: there is no counterfactual world
<em>w</em> in which (a) I exist, (b) my sensory evidence and
linguistic behavior are the same as it they are in the actual world,
and (c) my sentence &ldquo;I am a BIV&rdquo; expresses a content that
is true in <em>w</em>. Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument focuses on clause
(c). But the argument may also lead me to doubt that in Putnam&rsquo;s
BIV scenario my sensory <em>evidence</em> is the same as it is in the
actual world. For if I may rely on the argument to show that is not
&ldquo;epistemically possible<sub>K</sub>&rdquo; for me that I am a
BIV, I may also characterize my sensory evidence in representational
terms. A further, more speculative step is to theorize that even my
sensory <em>experiences</em> are not determined by my narrow
psychological states (Byrne &amp; Tye 2006).</p>

<p>
The BIV argument does not rule out that my brain was recently
transferred to a vat without my knowledge. Some philosophers (e.g.
Tymozcko 1989; Putnam 1998; Thorpe 2019; Thorpe &amp; Wright 2022)
argue that we may rely on our beliefs about the current state of
medical technology, not on semantics, to rule it out. Others argue
that &ldquo;the problem posed by the recent-envatment hypothesis is
equivalent in power and plausibility to that posed by the Putnamian
hypothesis&rdquo; (Christensen 1993: 314&ndash;315).</p>

<h3 id="SkeAboObj">7.5 Skepticism about objectivity</h3>

<p>
Thomas Nagel argues that Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument, if sound,
immediately raises another skeptical problem:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If I accept the argument, I must conclude that a brain a vat
can&rsquo;t think truly that it is a brain in a vat, even though
others can think this about it. What follows? Only that I can&rsquo;t
express my skepticism by saying &ldquo;Perhaps I am a brain in a
vat.&rdquo; Instead, I must say, &ldquo;Perhaps I cannot even think
the truth of what I am, because I lack the necessary concepts and my
circumstances make it impossible for me to acquire them!&rdquo; If
this doesn&rsquo;t qualify as skepticism, I don&rsquo;t know what
does. (Nagel 1986: 73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nagel presupposes that our representation of the world is more
encompassing, less limited, and therefore more objective than that of
a BIV. He raises the possibility that (a) there are true thoughts we
are unable to express or acquire and that (b) among these there may be
true thoughts that, if we could grasp them, would lead us to question
the objectivity of our current thoughts, by revealing to us truths
about our situation that are more encompassing, less limited, than the
ones we can now grasp. One might try to give some content to this
worry by reasoning by analogy: just as we grasp thoughts relative to
which the thoughts of a BIV are severely limited, so perhaps another
being can grasp thoughts relative to which our thoughts are
analogously limited (Ebbs 1992: 253&ndash;255; see also Smith 1984;
Wright 1994: 240; Forbes 1995: 220; Button 2013: 137; Sundell 2016:
section 14.5; and Thorpe &amp; Wright 2022: 86&ndash;87). Thorpe &amp;
Wright 2022 argue that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
at least one, bare bones, characterization of [this skeptical]
predicament needs only <em>logical</em> concepts, concepts of
<em>ourselves</em> as <em>thinking</em>, <em>epistemic agents</em>,
concepts of <em>metasemantics</em> and certain kinds of
<em>evaluative</em> concepts: it is the predicament in which <em>there
are</em> states of affairs to which <em>we</em> are so related that we
cannot <em>refer</em> to their constituent <em>objects</em> and
<em>properties</em>, nor therefore represent them in <em>true
thoughts</em>, and whose obtaining would be of <em>enormous
significance</em> to us could we but <em>know</em> of it. (Thorpe
&amp; Wright 2022, 86&ndash;87; for a similar strategy for responding
to Putnam&rsquo;s BIV argument, see Chalmers 2018: 630)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This worry, if unanswered, generates skepticism about objectivity
(Ebbs 1992: section IV).</p>

<p>
A natural first question to ask is whether we can make sense of
skepticism about objectivity if we accept CE. The following argument
suggests that we cannot. We have good reasons to believe that if we
were to learn a natural language we don&rsquo;t already know, such as
Danish or Chinese, we would thereby learn new concepts and come to be
able to express true thoughts that we could not express before. We may
be surprised by the concepts and thoughts we acquire in this way. But
the speakers of these languages live in the same spatiotemporal world
that we live in and are causally related to many, if not all, of the
same types of things that we are causally related to. There are
therefore no good reasons to suppose that the new concepts and
thoughts we come to grasp when we learn a natural language we
don&rsquo;t now know would lead us to question the objectivity of all
our current thoughts. To make sense of there being true thoughts that
are as alien to us as our thoughts are to the BIV while still
accepting SE and CE, we would have to make sense of there being a
practice of applying words and sentences to &ldquo;objects&rdquo; that
cannot be described or individuated in terms of anything we can locate
in space and time. If we take the causal constraint on reference,
meaning, and thought content seriously, however, we have no resources
for making sense of this. Skepticism about objectivity therefore
appears to be without any content for a content externalist. (The
argument sketched here is from Ebbs 1992: section XII. Different
arguments for similar conclusions are presented in Putnam 1994; D.
Davies 1997; and Button 2013: section 13.4.)</p>
