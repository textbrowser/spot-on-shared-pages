<p>
Environmental aesthetics is a relatively new sub-field of
philosophical aesthetics that took shape around the end of the
twentieth century. Prior to its emergence, aesthetics within the
analytic tradition was largely concerned with the philosophy of art.
Environmental aesthetics originated in part as a reaction to this
emphasis, shifting attention to the aesthetic appreciation of nature
and the environment. Although natural environments have been a major
focus, human and human-influenced environments have also been widely
studied. With increasing impacts of climate-change blurring this
distinction, philosophers have recently begun to grapple with the
changing character and role of environmental aesthetics in the
so-called &ldquo;Anthropocene Era&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The boundaries of environmental aesthetics are rather loose, a fact
that reflects the flexibility of its central concept of environment.
&ldquo;Environment&rdquo; can refer to an extensive, large-scale
background or setting in which particular events occur (Sparshott
1972; Carlson 1979): a forest, an ocean, a wetland. But talk about the
particular things that make up that background or setting&mdash;a
species of fish, an underground thermal vent, a heron&mdash;is also,
in a sense, talk about the environment (on the significance of the two
senses of &ldquo;environment&rdquo;, see Parsons 2015a). Thus
environmental aesthetics has naturally come to include the examination
of everything save art&mdash;all that exists within various
environments, including not only places and things but also events,
processes, and activities, both natural and human-made.</p>

<p>
This entry describes philosophical work on the aesthetics of
environments understood in this broad sense. Such vast philosophical
terrain has, understandably, also been surveyed from more particular
perspectives. So-called &ldquo;everyday aesthetics&rdquo;, for
instance, considers various elements of the environment from the
perspective of ordinary life experiences (for an overview see Saito
2015 [2024]). The aesthetics of architecture focuses on the built
structures that shape much of that experience (S. Fisher 2015 [2016]).
Nature aesthetics, in contrast, focuses upon environments where
non-human forces and elements predominate (see, for example Budd 2002;
Moore 2008; Parsons 2023b). Other approaches foreground more specific
concepts such as landscape (Benovsky 2016; Brook 2013; Andrzejewski
&amp; Salwa 2020) or place (Haapala 2005; Nomikos 2018). This entry,
however, focuses on the issues of most general significance to
environmental aesthetics.</p>

<p>
These issues overlap significantly with those of environmental ethics,
a field that originated at roughly the same time (see
 <a href="#AesEnv">section 3</a>
 below). More broadly, the concerns of environmental aesthetics mesh,
to some degree, with those of several academic fields beyond
philosophy, notably environmental psychology, restoration ecology, and
landscape architecture, as well as cultural geography, environmental
history, ecocritical literary studies and those other areas of study
grouped into the so-called &ldquo;Environmental Humanities&rdquo;
(Emmett &amp; Nye 2017; for a recent review of environmental
aesthetics aimed at an interdisciplinary audience, see Brady &amp;
Prior 2020).</p>

<h2 id="HisBac">1. Historical Background</h2>

<p>
Although environmental aesthetics developed as a sub-field of Western
philosophical aesthetics only in the last fifty years, it has
important historical roots in eighteenth and nineteenth century
European and North American thought. Though humans no doubt always
noticed the beauty or pleasantness of their surroundings, this period
shows the first unequivocal emergence, in the West, of a focused
aesthetic interest in landscape and natural surroundings. Key ideas
articulated during this period, such as disinterestedness, the
sublime, the picturesque, and positive aesthetics, continue to play a
role in contemporary work in environmental aesthetics. Though the
emphasis has been on these historical roots of environmental
aesthetics in European thought, scholars have increasingly brought
aesthetic traditions and theories from other cultures into the
philosophical discussion (see
 <a href="#GloPer">section 4.2</a>,
 below).</p>

<h3 id="EigCenOri">1.1 Eighteenth Century Origins</h3>

<p>
The eighteenth century was a period of unprecedented expansion in both
the scope of appreciation of the environment and its theoretical
articulation. Prior to this time, the environment had of course
figured in various kinds of art. The rural landscape was a
conventional setting for the Pastoral tradition in poetry, and
painters had always rendered landscapes as part of their work. In
these artistic traditions, however, landscape played a subsidiary
role, typically serving as a backdrop for exploration of historical,
religious, and moral themes. An early break with this relegation came
in the work of seventeenth century painters such as Lorrain, Rosa, and
Dughet, who brought landscape to the fore, positioning it as an
interesting artistic subject in its own right (Clark 1949). The works
of Lorrain, in particular, exerted a powerful pull on the British
imagination and fueled a craze in landscaping and gardening, as
aristocrats sought to cultivate Lorrain&rsquo;s dreamy pastoral on
their own estates. By the early nineteenth century, nature&rsquo;s
wilder side also took on a new allure as Europeans, warming to
Romantic conceptions of nature, found an edgy fascination in the Alps,
a landscape that had previously been regarded with various
combinations of revulsion and fear.</p>

<p>
Philosophers of this period attempted to map and understand these
changes in Taste. In an important conceptual shift, eighteenth century
philosophers pushed the traditional concept of the beautiful away from
its classical associations with love, possession, and desire,
emphasizing instead its <em>disinterested</em> character. This meant
that a thing&rsquo;s beauty was to be appraised apart from the
appreciator&rsquo;s particular personal, religious, economic, or
utilitarian interests (a classic historical overview is Stolnitz 1961;
for a recent reappraisal of the role of distinterestedness during the
eighteenth century, see Guyer 2003, 2014) . However, the classical
connotations of &ldquo;beauty&rdquo;&mdash;including not only love,
but also order, proportion, and harmony&mdash;were sufficiently
persistent to render it ill-suited for describing the new attractions
listed above. Thus eighteenth-century writers reached for alternative
vocabularies. Surroundings like those shown in Lorrain&rsquo;s
canvasses&mdash;subtly varied, irregular, delicate, and
&ldquo;fair&rdquo; in color&mdash;came to be described as
&ldquo;picturesque&rdquo; (Andrews 1989). Alpine peaks, in contrast,
were understood in terms of the sublime, a concept that had been used
in ancient rhetoric to describe the sort of expression accompanying
great minds and powerful thoughts (Monk 1935; Nicholson 1959). Into
the category of the sublime fell instances of the powerful, vast,
intense, terrifying, and formless: storms, great voids, powerful
waterfalls, and the like. Thus by century&rsquo;s end there existed a
triad of what were later recognized to be &ldquo;aesthetic
concepts&rdquo;&mdash;the beautiful, the sublime, and the
picturesque&mdash;each focusing on a contrasting aspect of
nature&rsquo;s perceptible character.</p>

<p>
Philosophical treatises of the period by figures such as Shaftesbury,
Hutcheson, Burke, and Alison analyzed these concepts and related them
to one another, frequently discussing the appreciation of nature and
landscape. Particularly influential was the account given by Kant in
his <em>Critique of the Power of Judgement</em> (1790), in which
nature was taken to be the exemplary object of aesthetic experience.
Kant&rsquo;s analysis of the idea of disinterestedness led him to
emphasize the role of formal elements in the beauty of nature: a
flower&rsquo;s beauty is a matter of its shape and has nothing to do
with its biological role in plant reproduction, or even its color.
Alongside this account of beauty, Kant also offered a sophisticated
analysis of the sublime that distinguished the experience of powerful
natural objects (which he called the &ldquo;dynamical sublime&rdquo;)
from the experience of vastness (the &ldquo;mathematical
sublime&rdquo;). Despite the formalist bent of his account, Kant gave
priority to natural beauty over that of art and argued that the
experience of natural beauty and sublimity had a deep moral
significance.</p>

<p>
Kant&rsquo;s writings ignored the picturesque, but of the three
aesthetic concepts listed above, it was arguably the one that
ultimately left the greatest legacy. In its initial use, the term
&ldquo;picturesque&rdquo; seems to have simply meant
&ldquo;painterly&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;the sort of landscape painted by
artists&rdquo;. But the term took on added resonance in light of the
close connections that came to be established between art and the
appreciation of landscape in the late seventeenth century. The British
aristocrats who reshaped their estates around picturesque ideals
sought not only varied and irregular landscapes, but a <em>view</em>
that in essence replicated the single-point perspective of a Lorrain
canvas. Thus in practice the term &ldquo;picturesque&rdquo; often
meant &ldquo;picture-like&rdquo;, and picturesque appreciation
typically equated the experience of a landscape with the experience of
a set of views, rather as if it were a set of large, out of doors
paintings. This involved assessing the view&rsquo;s &ldquo;subject
matter&rdquo;, &ldquo;composition&rdquo;, &ldquo;balance&rdquo;, and
so on. Thus, although philosophical theorists of the picturesque, such
as Uvedale Price (1796), took a more nuanced view (see
 <a href="#SubPic">section 4.3</a>
 below), in practice the popular ideal of the Picturesque often
equated nature and the environment, from an aesthetic point of view,
with scenery. This ideal provided the paradigm for the nascent
industry of scenic tourism, as travelers pursued picturesque views in
the Lake District, the Scottish Highlands, and the Wye valley with the
help of guidebooks by popular authors such as William Gilpin (for a
history of the Picturesque movement in Britain see Andrews 1989; for
an analysis of its key philosophical texts see Costelloe 2013).</p>

<h3 id="PicLegEcoAwa">1.2 The Picturesque Legacy and Ecological Awareness</h3>

<p>
After flowering in the eighteenth century, the aesthetics of nature
went into decline. The cultish enthusiasms that had developed around
the picturesque and the sublime subsided as these notions faded into
clich&eacute;s and ultimately blended into one another. The change is
vividly illustrated by shifting attitudes toward the Alps, which in
the early 1800s filled Romantic poets such as Byron and Shelley with
sublime feeling. By the second half of the century, visitors found
such feelings elusive quarry amid the tourists swarming Swiss towns
like Chamonix on packaged tours (Colley 2010). In philosophy,
Kant&rsquo;s influential successor Hegel viewed art, along with
religion and philosophy, as an important embodiment of &ldquo;Absolute
Spirit&rdquo; and saw it, rather than nature, as the favored subject
of philosophical aesthetics. In the nineteenth century, both on the
continent and in the United Kingdom, relatively few philosophers and
only a scattering of thinkers of the Romantic movement seriously
pursued theoretical study of the aesthetics of nature.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, however, a different perspective was taking shape across
the Atlantic. North American pioneers had viewed the
&ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; landscape that greeted them with a mixture of
fear and hostility and saw its conquest as their main priority (Nash
2001). But by the mid nineteenth-century Americans were confronted
with a landscape that, within living memory, had gone from
&ldquo;forest primeval&rdquo; to a frontier swiftly receding under the
advance of industry and colonization. Scientific figures such George
Perkins Marsh (Marsh 1865) raised concerns that the continued
destruction of American wilderness would have disastrous consequences
on critical resources such as forest watersheds. Philosophers such as
Emerson and Thoreau put forth the novel view that wilderness had a
crucial spiritual value that demanded its protection. The shift in
attitudes toward wilderness ultimately took form in the US
government&rsquo;s designation of the first protected areas in
Yosemite and Yellowstone in the late 1800s (Nash 2001).</p>

<p>
It was aesthetic values, however, that played a central, though
controversial, role in these events (Hargrove 1979). The protection of
Yellowstone and eventual creation of a system of National Parks based
on its model were primarily driven, not by love of wilderness or the
aim of ecological protection, but by the desire to preserve
America&rsquo;s most impressive scenery. This aim was both
nationalistic, being a means for the young Republic to assert its
&ldquo;visual supremacy&rdquo; over Europe, and commercial, given the
tantalizing possibilities for recreational and scenic tourism via the
nation&rsquo;s emerging railways (Runte 2022). Yellowstone and
Yosemite were often discussed in an explicitly art-like fashion as
&ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s masterpieces&rdquo;, and renderings of the
Western landscape by painters such as Moran, Hill, and Bierstadt
helped translate Western landscapes into the visual idiom of the
European Picturesque (Conron 2000; Wilton &amp; Barringer 2002). As
the National Park system took shape in the twentieth century, the
Picturesque mutated into new forms, with Gilpin&rsquo;s toolkit of
sketchpad, Claude glass, and hiking boots evolving into the pocket
camera, the automobile, and the roadside viewpoint: the tourist trope
that Donald Crawford called the &ldquo;postcardesque&rdquo; (Crawford
2004). Indeed, the &ldquo;scenic tourism&rdquo; paradigm&mdash;the
legacy of the eighteenth century Picturesque&mdash;not only spurred
development of the Park system but dominated park management thinking
for roughly a century (Sellars 1997).</p>

<p>
However, though the Picturesque proved a resilient&mdash;indeed
dominant&mdash;force, some early conservationists viewed the Park
system&rsquo;s fixation on scenery as a mistake. In their struggle to
reorient park policies toward ecological aims and priorities, they
sought different ways of understanding nature&rsquo;s aesthetic value.
Though they too applied the categories inherited from eighteenth
century aesthetics, in their hands these were altered and reshaped by
a growing awareness of the ecological relationships connecting humans,
animals, and the land. John Muir, the most prominent public advocate
of nature protection in nineteenth century America, is a case in
point. In his well-known essay &ldquo;A Near View of the High
Sierra&rdquo;, Muir contrasted his own experience of nature with that
of his artist companions, who, guided by the idea of the picturesque,
focused only on finding suitable views (Muir 1894). Muir&rsquo;s own
aesthetic, in contrast, incorporated a blend of religious feeling for,
and geological interest in, the mountain environment. Muir also used
the traditional idea of the sublime in describing his experience of
nature, reinterpreting it to fit his own experience of this &ldquo;new
world&rdquo; environment (Brady 2018). Similar ideas about natural
beauty and its relation to the naturalist&rsquo;s perspective were
pursued by later environmental thinkers, notably the forestry
scientist Aldo Leopold (1966).</p>

<p>
This ecological perspective brought thinkers like Muir to see the
whole of the natural environment, and especially wild nature, as
beautiful and to find ugliness primarily where nature was subject to
human intrusion. The range of things that Muir regarded as
aesthetically valuable seemed to encompass the entire natural world,
from creatures considered hideous in his day, such as snakes and
alligators, to natural disasters thought to ruin the environment, such
as floods, fires, and earthquakes. This view, which has come to be
known as &ldquo;positive aesthetics&rdquo;, eschews humanity&rsquo;s
marks on the natural environment. As such, it represents a sort of
converse of the Picturesque, which found interest and delight in
evidence of human presence (Carlson 1984a).</p>

<p>
These important shifts in cultural attitudes were more or less
completely ignored by Anglo-American philosophy. Though some
philosophers of the period (Santayana, Dewey, and Ducasse for
examples) did discuss the aesthetics of landscape or nature, this was
as an afterthought to their consideration of the arts. Indeed, by the
mid-twentieth century, within analytic philosophy, the principal
philosophical school in the English-speaking world at that time,
philosophical aesthetics was virtually equated with philosophy of art.
The leading aesthetics textbook of the period was subtitled
<em>Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism</em> and opened with the
assertion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There would be no problems of aesthetics, in the sense in which I
propose to mark out this field of study, if no one ever talked about
works of art. (Beardsley 1958: 1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Though meant to emphasize the importance of the analysis of language,
the remark also reveals the art-dominated construal of aesthetics of
that time. Some of the major figures working in the field in the
second half of the century portrayed aesthetic judgments, or important
aspects of them, as conceptually dependent upon the cultural
constraints, norms, and conventions that apply to works of art (Walton
1970; Dickie 1974). Nature, by definition existing beyond this
&ldquo;cultural matrix&rdquo;, therefore was, when considered at all,
viewed as problematic as an object of aesthetic appreciation.</p>

<h3 id="EmeEnvAes">1.3 The Emergence of Environmental Aesthetics</h3>

<p>
The study of nature aesthetics was ultimately rejuvenated in the 1960s
after a sense of environmental crisis took hold of popular
consciousness, leading to the emergence of the modern environmental
movement. One important practical development was the passage of
protective environmental legislation in the US and UK. Since some of
these laws made reference to &ldquo;natural beauty&rdquo; or
&ldquo;aesthetic values&rdquo;, clarifying these notions and
determining how to measure them became matters of practical, rather
than merely philosophical, importance. This led to the development of
empirical methods for &ldquo;visual landscape quality
assessment&rdquo; (VLQA) and to attempts to provide a theoretical
framework for their use (on the origin of VLQA see Zube, Sell, &amp;
Taylor 1982; for recent overviews of the field see Daniel 2001; C.
Thompson &amp; Tarvlou 2009). The latter included appeals to ideas in
developmental and environmental psychology (Kaplan &amp; Kaplan 1989;
Bourassa 1991) as well as evolutionary psychology (Appleton 1975a,
1982; Orians 1986; Orians &amp; Heerwagen 1992), an approach that has
attracted much philosophical attention (Davies 2012; Paden, Harmon,
&amp; Milling 2012; Bartalesi &amp; Portera 2015; Paden 2015a,
2016).</p>

<p>
A second source of theoretical work was the nascent field of
environmental philosophy, which produced works that appealed to beauty
and aesthetics as elements in a wider environmental philosophy (see,
e.g., Shepard 1967 [1991]). Within philosophical aesthetics itself,
however, the impetus for renewed attention to nature came largely from
Ronald Hepburn&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;Contemporary Aesthetics and the
Neglect of Natural Beauty&rdquo; (Hepburn 1966), which is widely
recognized as setting the agenda for the aesthetics of nature for the
late twentieth century (Brook 2010; Sep&auml;nmaa 2010; Carlson 2014;
Saito 2014). After noting that analytic aesthetics had virtually
ignored the natural world, Hepburn argued that an account of the
appreciation of nature would have to do more than simply extend
principles appropriate to the appreciation of art: it would need to
acknowledge the features distinctive to nature as an object of
appreciation . He claimed that in the aesthetic appreciation of
nature, as in the appreciation of art, there is a distinction between
appreciation that is only trivial and superficial and that which is
&ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;deep&rdquo;. Hepburn suggested that
the latter must acknowledge not only nature&rsquo;s indeterminate and
varying character, but also both our multi-sensory experience and our
diverse understanding of it. In short, nature is of no less aesthetic
interest than art, and ought to be appreciated based on principles
appropriate to it, rather than principles arbitrarily imported from
the Arts.</p>

<p>
In an aside, Hepburn attributed the decline in philosophical interest
in the aesthetics of nature, in part, to a degradation of our
experience of nature itself, referring to the &ldquo;forced ecstasies
and hypocrisies of a fashionable and trivialized nature-cult&rdquo;
(1966: 286). Hepburn&rsquo;s swipe at the standardized &ldquo;scenic
aesthetic&rdquo; of motorized tourism was an oblique one, but Allen
Carlson developed this theme into an explicit analysis and critique
(Carlson 1977, 1979). The foundation of the &ldquo;scenic
aesthetic&rdquo;, Carlson argued, was what he called &ldquo;the
landscape model&rdquo; of nature appreciation, which proposes
appreciating nature more or less as we appreciate landscape paintings.
This requires treating the environment as if it were a series of
two-dimensional scenes and focusing either on artistic qualities
dependent upon romantic images of the kind associated with the idea of
the picturesque or simply on its formal aesthetic qualities. Carlson
further argued that the VLQA techniques used to measure aesthetic
value for the purposes of environmental management were in fact
premised on this model and were therefore inadequate (Carlson 1977;
see also Sagoff 1974). Carlson&rsquo;s critique of VLQA methodology
connected directly to debates within the field itself over the
supposed lack of an adequate conceptual framework to support empirical
work, or what one critic called the field&rsquo;s &ldquo;theoretical
vacuum&rdquo; (Appleton 1975b; see also Sparshott 1972, Ribe 1982,
Carlson 1984b). Despite this overlap, philosophical and empirical
debates concerning nature&rsquo;s aesthetic value have largely
continued to play out independently (though see the discussion of
&ldquo;ecological aesthetics&rdquo; in
 <a href="">section </a>4.1,
 below).</p>

<p>
In the wake of the work done by Hepburn and Carlson, and in the
context of growing general interest in environmental issues, the
dismissal of nature as of little aesthetic interest no longer seemed
so compelling. In the discussions that followed, there were some
rearguard attempts to defend the neglect of natural beauty. One line
of thought, for example, argued that because nature is not
intentionally designed, it cannot be aesthetically appreciated
(Mannison 1980; Elliot 1982; though see Elliot 1997). However, such
views found little support, in part because so many of our fundamental
paradigms of aesthetic experience seem to involve nature: for example,
our delight in a sunset or in a bird in flight (Sibley 2001a).
Moreover, one important strand in the Western tradition of
aesthetics&mdash;the idea that anything that can be viewed can be
viewed aesthetically&mdash;rendered the exclusion of the natural world
arbitrary (Stolnitz 1960, Ziff 1979).</p>

<p>
On the whole, subsequent work in environmental aesthetics has accepted
the possibility that nature and the environment in general can be
aesthetically appreciated and has sought to understand such
appreciation. The result has been the mapping of a wide range of
possibilities concerning what the appreciation of nature involves, how
it ought to be cultivated, and what it implies about our treatment of,
and relationship to, nature and the environment. Nevertheless, the
thought that environmental appreciation remains in some way
subordinate to, or conceptually dependent upon, the appreciation of
art has persisted as a lingering, if rarely explicit, theme (for a
sophisticated version of the &ldquo;art-first&rdquo; thesis, see Gaut
2007: 34&ndash;41).</p>

<h2 id="ConVie">2. Contemporary Views</h2>

<p>
In this section we provide an overview of work on the aesthetics of
both natural and humanized, or &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;, environments.
We highlight the seminal contributions of Allen Carlson and
Arnold Berleant, given that most subsequent work has either directly
responded to their views and/or tacitly employed their framing of key
issues.</p>

<h3 id="NatEnv">2.1 Natural Environments</h3>

<p>
Alongside his critique of the &ldquo;scenic aesthetic&rdquo;, Carlson
developed the ideas of environmental thinkers such as Leopold and Muir
into an alternative view that he originally called the &ldquo;natural
environmental model&rdquo; of aesthetic appreciation (hereafter
&ldquo;NEM&rdquo;; Carlson 1979). On this view, appropriately
appreciating a natural environment requires regarding it as the
particular sort of environment that it is: that is to say, in terms of
the characterization of that environment provided by natural science.
Though this view rejects the appreciation of nature as if it were art
(as on the Picturesque-inspired &ldquo;landscape model&rdquo;),
Carlson argued for it by appealing to a general analogy
<em>between</em> nature and art. Just as &ldquo;serious&rdquo; or
appropriate aesthetic appreciation of art requires some knowledge of
art history and art criticism, such appreciation of nature requires
some knowledge of natural history: that is, knowledge provided by the
natural sciences, especially geology, biology, and ecology. For
instance, appropriate appreciation of a work such as Picasso&rsquo;s
<em>Guernica</em> (1937) requires that we experience it as what it
is&mdash;a cubist painting&mdash;and therefore that we appreciate it
in light of our knowledge of paintings in general and of cubist
paintings in particular (Walton 1970). The NEM applies the same
reasoning to natural things, asserting that scientific understanding
of nature can reveal the aesthetic qualities of natural objects and
environments in the way in which knowledge about art history and art
criticism so for works of art. In addition to this analogical
argument, Carlson and other defenders of this approach also offered
broadly ethical reasons to support it, holding, for instance, that
ecologically-informed appreciation of nature leads to better treatment
of the environment or greater support for more progressive environment
protection (Carlson 1981, Saito 1998b; for critical discussion see
Stecker 2012, Parsons 2018). Following his initial presentation of the
NEM, Carlson further developed and qualified the view (Carlson 1981,
2000, 2007): variations of it have been defended by a number of other
philosophers (Callicott 1994, 2003; Rolston 1995; Eaton 1998; Fudge
2001; Matthews 2002; Parsons 2002, 2006a, 2006b; Parsons &amp; Carlson
2004, 2008).</p>

<p>
While these views aimed to extend accepted ideas about art
appreciation to nature, Arnold Berleant&rsquo;s approach was based
instead on a radical rejection of many traditional ideas about
aesthetic appreciation. According to his &ldquo;aesthetics of
engagement&rdquo;, disinterested appreciation, with its isolating,
distancing, and objectifying gaze, is out of place in the aesthetic
experience of nature, wrongly abstracting both natural objects and
appreciators from the environments in which they properly belong and
in which appropriate appreciation is achieved. Instead, the aesthetics
of engagement stresses the contextual dimensions of nature and our
multi-sensory experiences of it. Viewing the environment as a seamless
unity of places, organisms, and perceptions, it challenges the
importance of traditional dichotomies, such as that between subject
and object. It beckons appreciators to immerse themselves in the
natural environment and to reduce to as small a degree as possible the
distance between themselves and the natural world. In short,
appropriate aesthetic experience involves the total immersion of the
appreciator in the object of appreciation (Berleant 1985, 1988, 1992,
2013b; for critical discussion see Carlson 1993, Budd 2002). Like
Carlson&rsquo;s NEM, Berleant&rsquo;s approach was taken up by later
writers (on the reception of Berleant&rsquo;s views, see the essays in
&#321;ukaszewicz Alvarez 2017 and Gladden-Obidzi&#324;ska 2021).</p>

<p>
Indeed, the stark dichotomy between the NEM and the aesthetics of
engagement evolved into a set of distinctions widely used to organize
the field, with positions being categorized as either
&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-cognitive&rdquo; (Godlovitch
1994; Eaton 1998; Carlson &amp; Berleant 2004),
&ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-conceptual&rdquo; (Moore 1999),
or &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; and &ldquo;ambient&rdquo; (Foster 1998).
Roughly, such distinctions marked a division between positions that
take knowledge and information to be essential to aesthetic
appreciation of environments, as per the NEM, and those that, like the
aesthetics of engagement, downplay this aspect and emphasize other
dimensions of appreciation. On the &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; side we
find, in addition to the NEM, views that require the belief that
nature has a non-human origin (e.g., Budd 2002) as well as views that
highlight other sources of belief such as local and regional
narratives, folklore, art, and mythological stories about nature
(Sep&auml;nmaa 1986 [1993], 2004; Saito 1998b; Heyd 2001; Leddy 2005;
Tafalla 2010). Because of this diversity amongst the
&ldquo;cognitivist&rdquo; views, the term &ldquo;scientific
cognitivism&rdquo; was introduced as a name for the NEM. On the
&ldquo;non-cognitive side&rdquo; of the ledger, we find views that
emphasize the role of emotion (Carroll 1993), a sense of mystery in
nature&rsquo;s otherness (Godlovitch 1994), &ldquo;formal
qualities&rdquo; (Zangwill 2001, 2005a, 2005b, 2013), metaphysical
ideas and insights (Hepburn 1996), and imagination (Brady 1998,
2003).</p>

<p>
Despite its prevalence, this cognitive/non-cognitive taxonomy is
ill-founded from a logical point of view and obscures some central
issues in the field. One problem is that it conflicts with a more
well-established philosophical usage on which
&ldquo;non-cognitive&rdquo; means lacking in truth value, or purely
emotive. In this sense, most of the views described above would be
accurately described as &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo;, given that they
involve beliefs and judgments. More importantly, this taxonomy runs
together two issues&mdash;which mental faculties have an important
role in aesthetic appreciation and whether scientific understanding is
necessary for it&mdash;that are better distinguished from one another
(Parsons 2023b). For instance, the taxonomy separates views that
accord central roles to imagination or emotion from those that give an
essential role to scientific understanding. But these features are by
no means exclusive: scientific understanding can engender emotional
responses, and imagination can take flight from, and inform,
scientific understanding. It is the second issue that in fact
separates these two camps: that is, the salient issue is whether
beliefs based in science or natural history are essential, in some
sense, for &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;
aesthetic appreciation, as the NEM asserts, thereby normatively
<em>constraining</em> permissible forms of imagining, emotional
response, and engagement.</p>

<p>
On that issue, a number of philosophers have argued that such
scientifically informed beliefs are <em>not</em> necessary for
appropriate appreciation, on grounds many and various: that the
NEM&rsquo;s appeal to science simply confuses facts and values
(Berleant 2016; Newman, Varner, &amp; Linquist 2017); that it
conflicts with the disinterestedness of aesthetic experience (Zangwill
2013); that the potential range of such belief is too great (Stecker
1997; Budd 2002); that it unduly limits the scope of aesthetic
experience (Heyd 2001; Brady 2003; Zangwill 2005b); and that such
beliefs are too abstract to affect aesthetic experience (Heyd 2001;
Hill &amp; Daniel 2008). Some proponents of these criticisms see
science as incompatible with aesthetic appreciation altogether,
whereas others allow that scientifically-informed appreciation is
possible, though merely one of a plurality of valid forms of
appreciation (see, e.g., Ross 2005).</p>

<p>
This last point highlights the fact that those who reject the
essential role for scientific knowledge proposed by the NEM and
related views still face the broader question of how to draw the
normative boundaries of nature appreciation. Is any appreciation of a
natural environment as acceptable, as appropriate, as any other? An
affirmative answer yields a strongly relativist view: any response to
nature is permissible, whether based on associations with myth, art,
or merely on personal fancy, so long as it enhances one&rsquo;s
appreciation in some way (Heyd 2001; for a classic articulation, see
Croce 1902 [1909/1922]). Among those rejecting the NEM, however, a
simple relativism has not been a popular option (Maskit 2014). More
common is an at least tacit appeal to some alternative set of
normative constraints.</p>

<p>
Zangwill, for instance, holds that aesthetic appreciation (about
inorganic nature at least) must involve only beliefs about perceptual
form (2001). Others argue that nature appreciation is constrained only
by an awareness that what is appreciated is natural, rather than
artifactual (J. Fisher 1998; Budd 2002), without any deeper scientific
understanding being necessary. Yuriko Saito proposes a moral
criterion; appreciation is appropriate so long as it makes nature and
its origins the center of a narrative that informs our experience of
it (1998a; 1998b). Such an attitude has a moral dimension, in
Saito&rsquo;s view, insofar as it expresses a recognition of the
autonomous value of that which is appreciated (see also Parsons 2018).
Hepburn also suggests a quasi-ethical, if also opposed criterion,
holding that appreciation is &ldquo;serious&rdquo; so long as it
engages with nature for the purposes of some kind of substantial
exploration of the self, as opposed to &ldquo;trivial amusement&rdquo;
(Hepburn 1993). In developing an account focused on imagination, Emily
Brady appeals to the constraining ideal of &ldquo;imagining
well&rdquo; (1998, 2003). Finally, Robert Stecker suggests a criterion
of culpable error in belief: appreciating a whale in the belief that
it is a fish counts as an aesthetic mistake, if I could reasonably be
expected, as a member of my culture, to know that whales are mammals,
not fish (2019).</p>

<p>
Much of this debate concerning the normativity of nature appreciation
parallels familiar discussions in the philosophy of art concerning the
possibility of correctness and error in judgments of artistic value.
For instance, Carlson&rsquo;s claim that appreciators versed in
natural history are best poised to appreciate nature echoes
Hume&rsquo;s famous claim that in evaluating art we should look to the
verdicts of properly informed and qualified &ldquo;ideal
critics&rdquo; (Hume 1757; see Carlson 1977). This view has been at
the center of much recent discussion of art (see, e.g., Levinson 2002;
Ross 2008; Lopes 2015). However, important aspects of the analogy
between Hume&rsquo;s ideal critics and the NEM&rsquo;s ideal
appreciators remain underexplored. For instance, Nick Riggle has
recently questioned the Humean approach, suggesting that the
&ldquo;aesthetic ideal&rdquo; may not be fully informed
connoisseurship but rather the cultivation of a more personally
invested relationship to art (Riggle 2015). An analogue of
Riggle&rsquo;s suggestion might also be applied to our &ldquo;taste
for nature&rdquo; (Parsons 2023b). Should we aim to experience and
appreciate the widest variety of environments, or should we instead
cultivate our attachments to those select few places to which we feel
some special, affective attachment? (on loving nature see Jamieson
2018)</p>

<h3 id="AesHumEnv">2.2 The Aesthetics of Human Environments</h3>

<p>
As is clear from early collections of essays in environmental
aesthetics (e.g., Kemal &amp; Gaskell 1993; Carlson &amp; Berleant
2004), the field initially concentrated on natural environments.
However, discussion quickly extended to humanized and human-influenced
environments (see von Bonsdorff &amp; Haapala 1999; Berleant &amp;
Carlson 2007; Arntzen &amp; Brady 2008). Here too the views of Carlson
and Berleant were influential. From early on, Berleant applied his
aesthetics of engagement to urban environments (Berleant 1978, 1984,
1986), later extending it to differing contexts such as rural
countrysides, small towns, theme parks, gardens, and museums (1997,
2004, 2005, 2010b, 2012). Rejecting the common treatment of city
aesthetics as mere visual amenity, Berleant instead portrays it as
involving an intimate engagement producing a &ldquo;mutual fashioning
of person and place&rdquo; (Berleant 1986). Subsequent researchers
have drawn on Berleant&rsquo;s ideas in exploring the experience of
urban and other humanly shaped environments (see, e.g., Haapala 1998;
von Bonsdorff 2002; Blanc 2013; Paetzold 2013; &#321;ukaszewicz
Alvarez 2017).</p>

<p>
Carlson&rsquo;s approach to the appreciation of human environments
mirrors the NEM, with the difference that for human environments it is
knowledge provided by the social sciences and history that is taken to
be essential for appropriate appreciation (Carlson 2009). What is
needed is to properly assess human artifacts such as buildings,
cities, bridges, and farms is information about their histories, their
functions, and their roles in our lives (Carlson 1985, 2001; Parsons
&amp; Carlson 2008). A related approach emphasizes the aesthetic
potential of cultural traditions, which seem especially relevant to
the appreciation of what might be termed cultural
landscapes&mdash;environments that constitute important places in the
cultures and histories of particular groups of people. What is often
called a &ldquo;sense of place&rdquo;, together with ideas and images
from folklore, mythology, and religion, frequently plays a significant
role in individuals&rsquo; aesthetic experience of their own home
landscapes (Saito 1985; Sep&auml;nmaa 1986 [1993]; Carlson 2000;
Sandrisser 2007; Firth 2008; Nomikos 2018).</p>

<p>
In these discussions, some specific types of humanized or
&ldquo;mixed&rdquo; environments have emerged as the subject of
particular interest: for example, the urban cityscape (von Bonsdorff
2002; Macauley 2007; Sep&auml;nmaa 2005, 2007; Parsons 2008; Erzen
&amp; Milani 2013; Frydryczak 2015) and specific elements within it
(shopping centers, e.g.; see Brottman 2007). Industrial and
post-industrial sites have also garnered attention. As cities ponder
what to do with massive derelict sites such as Detroit&rsquo;s defunct
auto plants, citizens have come to see them as aesthetically
interesting elements in the urban landscape, industrial
&ldquo;ruins&rdquo; that evoke responses reminiscent of the
Picturesque or the sublime (Maskit 2007; Kover 2014; Scarbrough 2018;
Conroy 2019; Herrington &amp; Lopes 2019).</p>

<p>
Of all humanized environments, however, the one with the most profound
resonance remains, perhaps, the garden. Biblical narratives around the
&ldquo;Garden of Eden&rdquo; and the role of gardens in Islamic art
offer familiar illustrations of the garden&rsquo;s hold on the
imagination. Another example is the ancient poetry of Theocritus and
Virgil, which established the literary convention of the pastoral, in
which shepherds loll in fruit-laden groves and sing love songs as they
follow their flocks across a tamed, carefree landscape. Though the
literary conventions of the pastoral had grown stale by the eighteenth
century, its fantasy of escape from corrupt urban life into bucolic
nature found new life in a passion for gardening and landscape design,
fueled in part by the Picturesque (Ross 1998). Recent philosophical
discussions have considered the meaning and aesthetics of contemporary
gardening in general (Crawford 1983; Miller 1993; Cooper 2006; Salwa
2014, 2019; Parsons 2023b), as well as the nature of specific types of
gardens, such as Japanese (Saito 1996; Carlson 1997; Heyd 2002; Brady,
Brook, &amp; Prior 2018; Chung 2018) and botanical gardens (Heyd
2006), and the relation of contemporary gardens to the Arts (Leddy
1988; Ross 2006). Philosophers have also discussed the related topics
of the rural landscape and the agricultural environment, with an eye
to the moral and environmental ramifications of the shift away from
small-scale agriculture to industrialized farming (on the rural
landscape see von Bonsdorff 2005; Andrews 2007; Benson 2008; Brook
2008; Leddy 2008; on agriculture see Carlson 1985; Schauman 1998;
Brady 2006; Herguedas 2018).</p>

<p>
Another contemporary type of humanized environment hearkens back to
the heyday of Picturesque gardening: the sites of environmental
artworks (Ross 1993, 1998). Large-scale artworks such as Michael
Heizer&rsquo;s <em>Double Negative</em>, Robert Smithson&rsquo;s
<em>Spiral Jetty</em>, and Christo&rsquo;s <em>Running Fence</em>
raise pertinent issues given that they are not only located in the
environment, but include some portion of it as a constitutive part of
the work. Adapting a term originally used by Smithson, Donald Crawford
described such works as involving different forms of
&ldquo;dialectical relationship&rdquo; between nature and culture
(Crawford 1983). Some argue that there is an ethical problem with
altering the environment in the way that environmental artworks do:
Allen Carlson refers to such works as &ldquo;aesthetic affronts&rdquo;
to nature (Carlson 1986, see also Humphrey 1985; Nannicelli 2018;
Parsons 2023b) In response, others have defended the possibility of
more ethical forms of environmental art, and explored its potential
benefits for raising environmental awareness (Heyd 2002; Brady 2007;
Brook 2007; J. Fisher 2007; Lintott 2007; Simus 2008b; Brady, Brook,
&amp; Prior 2018).</p>

<p>
A similar array of aesthetic, ontological, and ethical issues are
raised by restored environments. If a polluted wetland is restored to
look (and perhaps function) much as it did before it was damaged by
industry, is it thereby aesthetically equivalent to the original? Is
the idea of nature restoration conceptually coherent, or does
&ldquo;restoring&rdquo; nature simply turn it into an artifact?
(Elliot 1997; Ross 2006; Katz 2012) Should restoration be guided
purely by ecological concerns, or do aesthetic considerations also
have a role? (Heyd 2002; Brady, Brook, &amp; Prior 2018). A recent
twist on restoration is the idea of &ldquo;rewilding&rdquo;: simply
leaving an area free from future human intervention so that natural
forces can reassert themselves, rather than actively engineering the
environment to &ldquo;restore&rdquo; it to an original state. Prior
and Brady (2017) argue that rewilded spaces present new aesthetic
possibilities and challenges. This same theme emerges in recent
suggestions that anthropogenic climate change is creating
unprecedented and unpredictable types of &ldquo;mixed
environments&rdquo; that may not fit the aesthetic concepts of the
past (see
 <a href="#CliChaAes">section 4.6</a>,
 below).</p>

<h2 id="AesEnv">3. Aesthetics and Environmentalism</h2>

<h3 id="AesPro">3.1 Aesthetic Protectionism</h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, environmental aesthetics connects in important
ways with the concerns of environmental ethics. One such concern,
obviously, is environmental protection from human intrusion and
destruction. When development or exploitation of an environment could
turn a benefit for humans, why should we refrain? Prudential reasons
can sometimes be found, as when logging a watershed would threaten the
water supply for humans. But when self-inflicted damage to ourselves
or future generations is not reasonably likely, why should we opt to
spare the environment from development?</p>

<p>
Reflection on nature&rsquo;s beauty prompts the intuitive idea of
<em>Aesthetic Protectionism</em>: nature should be protected for,
amongst other things perhaps, its aesthetic value (see Leopold 1966;
Carlson 1976; Godlovitch 1989; Hargrove 1989; Rolston 2002; Hettinger
2008, 2010, 2017b; Robinson &amp; Elliott 2011; Cheng 2017a). As
mentioned above, this idea was a key motivation behind the National
Park idea in North America and it continues to be an effective tool
for environmental causes today. Protecting the magnificent polar bear
from habitat loss is a powerful argument for restricting human
development projects in the north, for example. Moreover, from a
philosophical point of view, this idea allows one to ground nature
protection, when merely prudential grounds will not suffice, on a
familiar and uncontroversial kind of value&mdash;aesthetic value
(Sober 1986). Despite its initial attractiveness, however, Aesthetic
Protectionism faces some important complications and significant
objections (Carlson 2010; Hettinger 2017b; Parsons 2023b; for a
collection of relevant papers see Carlson &amp; Lintott 2008).</p>

<p>
One issue arises when this notion is used to ground the preservation
of <em>natural</em> environments specifically, since in some contexts
measures that preserve the beauty of an environment may arguably also
render it something that is no longer natural (Godlovitch 1989; K. Lee
1995). A longstanding national park policy, for instance, was to
protect park forests from the devastation of naturally occurring
wildfire; in this case, one might question whether the beauty retained
could quite be called &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. In other contexts,
Aesthetic Protectionism may appear self-defeating for a different
reason: for remote and ecologically fragile areas, focusing protection
efforts around aesthetic considerations may actually put the area
further at risk of degradation by attracting increased sight-seeing
traffic (Parsons 2015b; Tenen 2020). Further, if aesthetic value is
appraised through some version of the still-popular &ldquo;scenic
aesthetic&rdquo;, the upshot of Aesthetic Protectionism is apt to be
highly selective protection of those areas and species considered
&ldquo;nature&rsquo;s masterpieces&rdquo;: spectacular mountains and
&ldquo;charismatic megafauna&rdquo; like the polar bear and panda.
Less impressive specimens&mdash;wetlands, prairie, insects, and
rodents&mdash;will be left out, even though their ecological
significance may in fact be much greater (Saito 1998a, Rolston 2000,
Callicott 2003; Hettinger 2010). A related concern is the way in which
aesthetic considerations can provide an equally ready tool for those
<em>opposing</em> environmentally beneficial policies, such as wind
farming (Saito 2004; for further discussion of this case see Boone
2005, Gray 2012). Such concerns might lead one to the skeptical
conclusion that aesthetic value actually conflicts with the aims of
environmentalism or is, at best, too superficial to ground policies of
action on matters of environmental protection (Loftis 2003; Stewart
&amp; Johnson 2018; for further discussion of the philosophical issues
involved see Doran 2022).</p>

<p>
A defender of Aesthetic Protectionism might respond that this last set
of concerns ultimately stems from the scenic aesthetic, a view that
should be rejected. Indeed, Hepburn and Carlson&rsquo;s early
critiques of the Picturesque have been echoed by many writers
concerned with environmental protection, who have dismissed the scenic
aesthetic as anthropocentric (Godlovitch 1994), scenery-obsessed
(Saito 1998a; Gobster 1999), trivial (Callicott 1994), subjective (J.
Thompson 1995), and/or morally vacuous (Andrews 1989). But even
granting the case against the scenic aesthetic, it remains an open
question how its replacement would fare with respect to the problems
just cited. How widely will we find aesthetic value in nature? Will
focusing protective efforts on aesthetics help or hinder environmental
protection, from an ecological perspective? The most promising
candidate on many of these scores would seem to be the NEM and its
variants, given that these approaches take ecological understanding to
be critically relevant to aesthetic appreciation. Nonetheless, some
have questioned the extent to which even ecologically-informed
approaches can successfully address these issues (Budd 2002; Hettinger
2005, 2008; Berleant 2010a, 2016; Bannon 2011; Stecker 2012; Herguedas
2018; Mikkonen 2018).</p>

<h3 id="PosAes">3.2 Positive Aesthetics</h3>

<p>
For some sympathetic to Aesthetic Protectionism, the idea of
&ldquo;positive aesthetics&rdquo; has seemed to offer an attractive
solution to some of its difficulties. This is the idea that every part
of nature, properly seen, is beautiful (or alternatively, that there
is no ugliness in nature). &ldquo;Properly seen&rdquo; here has often
been understood to mean &ldquo;seen in light of scientific
understanding&rdquo;, so that Positive Aesthetics has been viewed as
closely connected to the NEM and related views. If correct, the
implication of positive aesthetics would seem to be that no
environment or species is, in principle, beyond the pale of aesthetic
protection. However, the idea of positive aesthetics as stated above
is vague, and working out a version that is precise, helpful in the
case for aesthetic protection, and not subject to counterexamples has
proven difficult.</p>

<p>
A number of different approaches to articulating and defending the
idea of positive aesthetics have been taken. Allen Carlson argues that
because scientific understanding brings order, regularity, and pattern
to natural phenomena, environments viewed in light of such
understanding, as per the NEM, will appear aesthetically good (Carlson
1984a; see also Parsons 2002). Yuriko Saito argues that everything in
a natural environment takes on aesthetic interest when made the focus
of a story, whether scientific, cultural, or mythological, that
illuminates and explains its origins (Saito 1998a). Another approach
traces the lack of aesthetic failure in natural environments to the
absence of normative functions in inorganic systems (Parsons 2004;
Parsons &amp; Carlson 2008; for discussion see Zangwill 2005a). Holmes
Rolston offers a holistic explanation by way of the larger ecological
role played by individual elements of an environment. Though a dead
animal carcass or a forest burned by natural wildfire may appear ugly
when considered in isolation, this ugliness is ameliorated once these
elements are considered in their wider context (Rolston 1988;
Hettinger 2017a).</p>

<p>
Critics of positive aesthetics have offered a variety of objections to
these views. Some find the idea problematic because it appears to
undercut the possibility of the comparative assessments thought to be
necessary for environmental planning and protection (J. Thompson 1995;
Godlovitch 1998a; Newman, Varner, &amp; Linquist 2017). Others have
objected that the idea itself seems unintuitive, obscure, and/or
inadequately justified (Godlovitch 1998b; Budd 2002; Alcaraz
Le&oacute;n 2010; Brady 2011; Stecker 2012). Even philosophers open to
the idea of positive aesthetics have expressed reservations about some
of its formulations, arguing that these depend too heavily on an
out-dated conception of ecology and/or fail to stress an evolutionary
understanding of nature (Simus 2008a; Paden, Harmon, &amp; Milling
2012; Paden 2015a).</p>

<h3 id="AesBio">3.3 Aesthetics and Biodiversity</h3>

<p>
The idea of positive aesthetics is appealing as a way of addressing
the worry that the scope of Aesthetic Protectionism will be too
limited. Perhaps more fundamental than this concern however, is the
worry that that much environmental protection today seems motivated
not by any aesthetic considerations, but by the imperative to minimize
biodiversity loss. That is, the habitats or species viewed as most in
need of protection are those which are most rare or highly endangered.
The desire to maximize biodiversity and the desire to maximize the
amount of aesthetic value in the environment appear to be distinct
motives, and indeed often pull us in different directions. If forced
to choose between protecting a rare but visually offensive species
from extinction and improving the prospects for a stunning but
unimperiled one, the aesthetic protectionist will opt for the latter.
But this is a decision many environmentalists would surely find
troubling.</p>

<p>
These environmentalists might prefer to eschew talk of aesthetic
protection, and insist that preservation of biodiversity is, in its
own right, a distinct reason for foregoing development. Of course,
they then face the task of showing why this is a <em>good</em> reason.
Again, prudential reasons for minimizing species loss may be available
in particular situations, but an environmentalist might insist that
biodiversity should be protected even when they are not.</p>

<p>
Such a claim might be grounded by Aesthetic Protectionism, if one
could argue that biodiversity and aesthetic value are conceptually
connected. One suggestion for this latter approach appeals to a
parallel with art: the rarer a type of artwork becomes, the greater
its artistic value. As Sober puts it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A work of art may have enhanced value simply because there are very
few other works by the same artist, or from the same historical
period, or in the same style. (Sober 1986: 190)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A similar increase in the aesthetic value of individual organisms upon
diminishment in their species&rsquo; numbers would mandate
prioritizing endangered species, on purely aesthetic grounds (Russow
1981; for criticism of this approach see Godlovitch 1989; Davies 2012;
Newman, Varner, &amp; Linquist 2017; Welchman 2020).</p>

<p>
A different approach is suggested by Jennifer Welchman, who argues
that biodiversity is connected to aesthetic value in a more indirect
way. Since aesthetic experience is a basic good, she argues, the state
has an obligation to protect the means for obtaining it. Since a
satisfying aesthetic life requires a rich and diverse array of things
to appreciate, this obligation requires protecting the diverse array
of natural environments and species that we possess. Thus broadly
aesthetic considerations mandate the protection of biodiversity, just
as they mandate the state&rsquo;s preservation and promotion of wide
array of different types of Art (Welchman 2018, 2020; for a critical
response, see Linquist 2020).</p>

<p>
Welchman&rsquo;s analysis helpfully situates discussions of aesthetics
and environmental protection in a broader political context. Such
contexts, however, are often not as idealized as her argument
suggests. As mentioned above, environmental legislation does sometimes
make reference to aesthetic considerations, but often in ways that are
far removed from theoretical considerations of basic goods and
distributive justice. Levi Tenen has documented the important role
played in US environmental protection by the &ldquo;National
Monuments&rdquo; designation created in the 1906 Antiquities Act
(Tenen 2023). Strictly speaking, declaring a forest or a mesa a
&ldquo;monument&rdquo; makes little sense; moreover, it arbitrarily
imposes, at least tacitly, an existing aesthetic framework (that
relevant to memorial statuary) upon the natural entity being
protected. Yet, for contingent historical reasons having to do with
the balance of powers in the US government, monument designation
emerged as an important way in which aesthetically motivated
environmental protection unfolds in practice. Understanding the limits
and possibilities of aesthetic protection will require further
investigation of the legal institutions of environmental policy and
the ways in which aesthetic values are embedded in them (see
especially Richardson 2019; but also Saito 2007; Berleant 2010b, 2012;
Sep&auml;nmaa 2010; Robinson &amp; Elliott 2011).</p>

<h2 id="TheDirRecWor">4. Themes and Directions in Recent Work</h2>

<p>
In this concluding section we discuss six themes that represent new
directions pursued in recent work in environmental aesthetics. Beyond
those mentioned here, other issues include the social and
quasi-institutional dimensions of environmental appreciation (Lopes
2020), the expressiveness of landscape (Wollheim 1991 [1993]; Howarth
1995; P&eacute;rez-Carre&ntilde;o 2021), the role of sound in
environmental appreciation (J. Fisher 1998, 1999; Dyck 2016; Prior
2017), the connection between environmental aesthetics and feminist
thought (W. Lee 2006; Lintott 2010), and the role of consumer
aesthetics in causing environmental damage (Lintott 2006; Saito 2007,
2018; Maskit 2011; for an unvarnished historical overview, see
Richardson 2019).</p>

<h3 id="WhaEcoAes">4.1 What is &ldquo;Ecological Aesthetics&rdquo;?</h3>

<p>
One long-standing theme in environmental aesthetics is the continuing
effort to connect aesthetic experience with the central environmental
notion of ecology. As noted above, the NEM has often been presented as
developing the ecological perspective implicit in the thought of
scientific figures such as Leopold and Muir. Beyond philosophy, a
version of this idea, going under the name &ldquo;ecological
aesthetics&rdquo;, has been defended in the fields of land management
and landscape architecture (see Gobster 1995, 1999, 2013, 2008; Eaton
1997; Nassauer 1997b). &ldquo;Ecological Aesthetics&rdquo;, in this
context, is characterized as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
by definition, normative in that it asserts that it is desirable for
humans to take aesthetic pleasure from landscapes that embody
beneficial ecological functions. (Gobster et al. 2007: 962)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While this idea is obviously closed related to the NEM, the
qualification &ldquo;beneficial&rdquo; introduces a subtle difference:
appropriate appreciation of a landscape requires not only an
understanding of its ecological <em>operation</em>, but also positive
appraisal of its ecological <em>value</em>. On this view, the
ecologically harmful&mdash;invasive species, for example&mdash;cannot
be aesthetically good, regardless of their showy looks or interesting
biology (for critical discussion see Parsons &amp; Daniel 2002; on
other recent discussions of the alignment of ecological and aesthetic
value, see
 <a href="#CliChaAes">section 4.6</a>
 below)</p>

<p>
More recently the label &ldquo;ecological aesthetics&rdquo; has also
been adopted by some philosophers working in the so-called
&ldquo;Continental tradition&rdquo; (Toadvine 2009). Drawing on
figures such as Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, this
perspective overlaps in some ways with Berleant&rsquo;s aesthetics of
engagement, which in turn was influenced by ideas from Phenomenology
(see Berleant 1985, 2013a). In this work, the label
&ldquo;ecological&rdquo; is connected to the philosophical claim that
organisms cannot be distinguished from their environment, except
through an abstraction that distorts the ontologically primary reality
of their embodied experience (for related Continentalist perspectives,
see Tafalla 2011; Leddy 2012a; Maskit 2014; Seel 2015;
J&oacute;hannesd&oacute;ttir 2016; Greaves 2019).</p>

<p>
Still another interpretation of &ldquo;ecological aesthetics&rdquo;
can be found in recent Chinese philosophy, where several writers have
developed robust versions of &ldquo;ecoaesthetics&rdquo; (two
prominent versions available in English translation are Cheng 2013a,
2016 and Zeng 2017). Cheng embraces, as his &ldquo;four keystones of
ecological aesthetic appreciation&rdquo;, not only the centrality of
ecological knowledge and the rejection of the duality of humanity and
the natural world, but also the over-arching value of ecosystem
biodiversity and health and the continued guidance of ecological
ethics (Cheng 2013c). While the first of Cheng&rsquo;s
&ldquo;keystones&rdquo; is redolent of the NEM and the standard
scientific understanding of ecology, the others invoke a more
philosophical conception of &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; that has closer
affinities to Berleant&rsquo;s notion of engagement, the
Continentalist ideas discussed above, and elements of traditional
Chinese philosophy (Carlson 2017, 2018, Parsons &amp; Zhang 2018; for
further discussion of the relation between ecoaesthetics and
Berleant&rsquo;s view, see Berleant 2016, Cheng 2021).</p>

<h3 id="GloPer">4.2 Global Perspectives</h3>

<p>
Mention of the role of Chinese philosophy in Cheng&rsquo;s
ecoaesthetics points to a second theme: growing interest in a
diversity of cultural perspectives. This trend follows recent calls
for the globalization of aesthetics in general (Li &amp; Cauvel 2006;
Gandolfo &amp; Worth 2015; Higgins 2017) and of environmental
aesthetics in particular (Saito 2014; Liu &amp; Carter 2014b). Some
non-western perspectives have been considered in the Anglo-American
literature: in addition to recent engagement with Chinese perspectives
(Xue &amp; Carlson 2010; Cheng et al. 2013; Liu &amp; Carter 2014a;
Chen 2007 [2015]; Brubaker 2018; Xue 2018), Japanese aesthetics has
also been discussed (Saito 1985, 1992, 1996, 2002, 2014; Carlson 1997;
Odin 2017; Callicott &amp; McRae 2017; Chung 2018; Nguyen 2018). Also,
within the &ldquo;Western perspective&rdquo; itself, some have
considered the particular attitudes to landscape in specific regions
or countries (Finland, for example: see Sep&auml;nmaa &amp;
Heikkil&auml;-Palo 2005; Sep&auml;nmaa, Heikkil&auml;-Palo, &amp;
Kaukio 2007).</p>

<p>
A wider form of globalization, however, would look beyond the major
global cultures (the Western and Chinese, e.g.) and their variants to
the world&rsquo;s many small scale &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; cultures.
An understanding of this broader diversity in aesthetics need not be
solely of anthropological interest. Nanda Jarosz, for instance, argues
that philosophical theories in environmental aesthetics should
consider not only scientific knowledge, but also the role of
indigenous and local knowledge in aesthetic appreciation of the
environment (Jarosz 2023). The challenge for such projects, however,
is to connect the European/North American ideas of &ldquo;the
aesthetic&rdquo;, which remain the touchstone of much contemporary
philosophizing, to sets of ideas, values and practices from very
different cultural contexts.</p>

<p>
In many ways, the theoretical issues here parallel those in
long-standing controversies about the &ldquo;art&rdquo; status of
traditional artifacts from pre-industrial, tribal cultures (for an
overview of this debate, see Dutton 2008 and Shiner 2008). In the
context of the environment, however, different understandings of the
&ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; meaning and value of the land can have very
real political and economic implications, such as the dispossession of
land used by indigenous North Americans to facilitate the creation of
parks where &ldquo;nature&rdquo;s beauty&rsquo; could be preserved and
enjoyed (Cronon 1996; Spence 1999). Similar cross-cultural issues
continue to play out across the so-called &ldquo;developing
world&rdquo; (for recent discussions that bring out many of the
relevant issues, see Saunders 2013; Maduka 2014; Vice 2023).</p>

<h3 id="SubPic">4.3 The Sublime and the Picturesque</h3>

<p>
Recent years have seen a reappraisal of the moribund notions of the
picturesque and sublime. As described above, philosophers and
historians have often castigated the Picturesque as the fountainhead
of the problematic &ldquo;scenic aesthetic&rdquo;. Recently, however,
some have highlighted more nuanced versions of the concept, such as
that employed by the eighteenth-century thinker Uvedale Price (1796).
Roger Paden argues that Price&rsquo;s notion of the picturesque did
not involve treating nature in a formalist or art-like fashion, and
further emphasizes an important interrelation with the distinct
aesthetic qualities of beauty and sublimity (Paden 2013; Paden,
Harmon, &amp; Milling 2013). Paden concludes that that suitably
understood, the concept has an important role to play in the
aesthetics of nature, providing the basis for a normative account of
appreciation rooted in evolutionary biology (Paden 2015a, 2016; Paden,
Harmon, &amp; Milling 2012). In a similar vein, Isis Brook argues that
the picturesque is particularly apt for appreciating gardens and the
rural landscape, expressing &ldquo;a love of wild nature in a small
compass&rdquo; (Brook 2008).</p>

<p>
The notion of the sublime has also seen a rejuvenation. In seminal
discussions, Guy Sircello (1993) and Ronald Hepburn (1988) asked why
the sublime fell into desuetude, and suggested that, despite its
neglect by philosophers, it might still have relevance to contemporary
experience. Understanding of the former issue has been advanced by
recent historical work on both the decline of sublime discourse in the
context of modern tourism (e.g., Colley 2010) and its persistence in
more extreme pursuits such as mountaineering (Macfarlane 2003; Hollis
2019).</p>

<p>
The call for renewed philosophical attention to the sublime has been
taken up by philosophers such as Emily Brady, who surveys early
philosophical discussions of the concept and defends a broadly Kantian
view of the sublime, on which it blends &ldquo;aesthetic
self-reflection with admiration that is externally directed&rdquo;
(Brady 2013: 118; for discussion see Mahoney 2016). Also reanalyzing
the classical theories of the eighteenth-century, Sandra Shapshay
attempts to reconcile the approaches of Kant and Edmund Burke in a
&ldquo;two-tiered&rdquo; theory by distinguishing between a
&ldquo;thick&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin&rdquo; sublime. The Burkean
&ldquo;thin sublime&rdquo; is an unreflective, awe-like response
whereas the thick involves reflection, a la Kant, on the challenge
posed to our cognitive capacities by the sublime object (2013, 2019,
2021). Shapshay argues that this distinction allows an explanation of
the cross-cultural occurrence of sublime experience, as well as its
cultural variation and historical evolution.</p>

<p>
Other writers have looked instead to contemporary psychology to frame
new theories of the sublime and related emotions, such as awe.
Arcangeli and Dokic, for example, analyze sublime experience in terms
of &ldquo;radical limit experience&rdquo;, in which awareness of an
insurmountable cognitive obstacle triggers a temporary feeling of
self-negation (2021; see also Cochrane 2012; McShane 2018; Clewis
2019a). Despite their differences, these theories all characterize
sublimity as a response to some form of cognitive failure. In
contrast, Parsons (2023a) proposes a reinterpretation of the concept
in terms of a form of cognitive success&mdash;a qualitative increase
in perceptual ability which he calls &ldquo;epistemic
expansion&rdquo;&mdash;arguing that so reconstrued, the sublime
provides an apt vocabulary for certain aesthetic dimensions of
contemporary experimental science.</p>

<h3 id="AesAni">4.4 The Aesthetics of Animals</h3>

<p>
A fourth area of recent interest is the aesthetic appreciation and
value of non-human animals. (Hettinger 2010; Davies 2012) As mentioned
in
 <a href="#PosAes">section 3.2</a>
 above, aesthetic considerations sometimes play a role in debates over
the protection of species and their habitats. Empirical research
confirms the intuitive thought that a species&rsquo; perceived
attractiveness is an important factor in its garnering public support
for protection (see, e.g., Landov&aacute; et al. 2018; Richardson
2019). Cuteness, of course, constitutes one of the central elements of
this perceived attractiveness (Lorenz 1950 [1971]; Morreall 1991;
Sanders 1992).</p>

<p>
From a more philosophical point of view, some have suggested
alternative perspectives on animal beauty. One approach focuses on the
sentient movement or &ldquo;animation&rdquo; of animals as their most
aesthetically salient feature (for variations on this theme see
Ruskin 1846; Rolston 1987; Vice 2017; Greaves 2019). Others argue that
animals should be appreciated not merely for cuteness or animation,
but in light of the biological and ecological function of their form
and behavior (Parsons 2007; Parsons &amp; Carlson 2008). This view holds that though many creatures have features
that strike us as odd, sinister, or grotesque, an understanding of the
adaptedness of their morphology and behavior to their particular
environment reveals a satisfying aptness. Proponents also argue that
such appreciation is more appropriate, from an ethical point of view,
than the usual ranking of species according to their cuteness and
possession of human-like qualities (for critical discussion see Davies
2010).</p>

<p>
The functionalist approach to animal beauty suggests an argument for a
form of Positive Aesthetics as applied to species, given that all
species have form and behavior adapted to their particular
environmental niche, for to find a species ugly might seem to require
judging its form and behavior as deviant or unfitting (see Sibley
2001b). On the other hand, some insist that ugly species exist. Emily
Brady argues that many species, such as toads and the Madagascan
Aye-Aye lemur, qualify as ugly in virtue of possessing unappealing or
disgusting features such as sliminess, being foul smelling, and being
oddly proportioned (Brady 2014a). This issue turns, in part, on how
the concept of ugliness is understood; on the traditional account of
ugliness as involving deformity, the afore-mentioned qualities, though
perhaps disgusting, would not constitute ugliness (Sibley 2001b; for
discussion of ugliness, see Sauchelli 2014, Paris 2017).</p>

<p>
Even admitting these as relevant to ugliness, Parsons (2023b)
questions whether Brady&rsquo;s particular counterexamples would
refute the positive aesthetics claim, given that aesthetically
positive features (the Aye-Aye&rsquo;s adaptedness, the toad&rsquo;s
beguiling eyes, for example) also merit consideration. Setting aside
this dispute about vertebrates, the most promising candidates for ugly
species are surely to be found among those of our relatives that seem
most alien to us: the insects. Here again, however, the key issue is
how we should relate the instinctive (and presumably adaptive) fear
and repulsion triggered by &ldquo;creepy crawlies&rdquo; to the notion
of aesthetic appreciation.</p>

<p>
Another phenomenon raising similar conceptual difficulties is animal
predation. The relentless violence and bloodshed that characterizes
animal existence in nature strikes many as profoundly ugly. Here,
however, the &ldquo;ugliness&rdquo; appears to have an important moral
dimension. What makes the cheetah&rsquo;s killing and eating of a
young impala ugly is that an innocent sentient being has been made to
suffer pain and death, an event which seems clearly bad and a source
of disvalue in the world. This analysis, however, raises deep
questions about the cogency of applying moral categories to animal
behavior. Given a lack of the kinds of reflective capacities humans
possess, cheetahs cannot be considered moral agents or blamed for the
act of killing their natural prey (see Carlson 2018). As such, it is
unclear what aesthetic significance should be given to the apparent
&ldquo;ugliness&rdquo; of natural animal behavior.</p>

<p>
In response to this view, Hettinger argues that even if amoral, animal
suffering caused by predation remains something bad, a form of
disvalue that colors our aesthetic experience of the animal world. But
he suggests that predation&rsquo;s negative aspects must be considered
alongside the essential evolutionary and ecological role it plays in
the development of life on earth. Balancing these conflicting aspects
of predation, he sees in it a kind of beauty, albeit a &ldquo;a sad
beauty, perhaps even a terrible one&rdquo; (Hettinger 2010).</p>

<p>
A final point of interest regarding the aesthetics of animals has been
the multitude of specific ways in which people aesthetically encounter
them, such as in the wild (Rolston 1987), in the &ldquo;rewild&rdquo;
(Prior &amp; Brady 2017), in scientific or quasi-scientific displays
such as aquaria (Leddy 2012b; Semczyszyn 2013a), in zoos (Tafalla
2017; Parsons 2023b) and as parts of certain artworks (Cross 2018;
Brady 2010).</p>

<h3 id="MedApp">4.5 Mediated Appreciation</h3>

<p>
Mention of animal appreciation in the context of aquaria and other
sorts of quasi-scientific displays, such as museum dioramas, points
toward a fifth theme: the possibility that environmental appreciation
can occur through, or be mediated by, a representation (Semczyszyn
2013a, 2013b; see also Friday 1999). This is an intuitive idea, given
the popularity and influence of artistic genres such as wildlife
painting, wildlife and nature photography, and nature film. However,
in line with the widespread critique of the Picturesque, the
&ldquo;landscape model&rdquo;, and other art-centric approaches in
environmental aesthetics, the idea of mediated nature appreciation has
found little support in the literature. Semczyszyn and Friday,
however, argue that mediated appreciation is not only valid, but an
important dimension of our appreciation of nature and the environment
(see also Brady &amp; Prior 2020).</p>

<p>
Recent writers have explored this general idea in relation to
traditional media such as landscape painting (Paden 2015b; Matthes
2020), as well as nature photography and film (Parsons 2022; Hanich
2023; for a interesting auditory example see Matthes 2018). The latter
furnish examples of ways in which new technologies have radically
expanded the possibilities for aesthetic engagement with the natural
world by providing new ways of seeing (Lopes 2003). High speed and
time lapse cinematography, for instance, allow for the perception of
events that unfold too rapidly or too slowly for humans to witness in
unmediated experience, such as the strike of a chameleon&rsquo;s
tongue or the recession of a glacier. A more recent form of such
&ldquo;generative mediation&rdquo; is digital astrophotography, a
technology that allows for the visualization of faint celestial
objects such as nebulae (on the aesthetics of astrophotography see
Chadwick 2017, 2019; Parsons 2023a; see also Kessler 2012).</p>

<p>
In addition to its intrinsic interest, the possibility of mediated
appreciation relates to a wider debate, mentioned in
 <a href="#NatEnv">section 2.1</a>
 above, regarding the role of art in the appreciation of nature and
the environment. It also connects directly to debates about
environmental protection, insofar as the ideal of &ldquo;really
experiencing&rdquo; a location or animal (i.e., experiencing it in
person, rather than through a photograph, painting, or film) is an
important driver of tourist traffic that often generates environmental
harm and, in some cases, can compromise the location itself (Parsons
2015b).</p>

<h3 id="CliChaAes">4.6 Climate Change and Aesthetics</h3>

<p>
A final theme in recent work is the growing interest in climate change
and its current and future effects from an aesthetic point of view. As
mentioned above, Di Paola and Ciccarelli (2022) argue that climate
change has already created new and uncontrollable environments that
constitute an unpredictable &ldquo;mash up&rdquo; of human and natural
forces. Along with other writers, they have speculated on how these
shifting environments may change our aesthetic experiences and
responses. A key issue in these discussions is the significance of
moral emotions prompted by the damaged environments of the
Anthropocene: guilt, shame, sadness, and the like. Will such emotions
color, perhaps even annihilate, the possibility of aesthetic value in
these environments?</p>

<p>
Some are pessimistic about our future encounters with the environment.
Jukka Mikkonen, for example, argues that concepts once central to our
appreciation of the environment, such as awe and wonder, will yield to
a &ldquo;new aesthetics of strangeness and uncertainty&rdquo;
(Mikkonen 2022, see also Auer 2019). Others see more room for
optimism, arguing that, the &ldquo;moral taint&rdquo; of our damaged
environments notwithstanding, there will remain the possibility for
positive experiences of beauty and aesthetic value (Alcaraz
Le&oacute;n 2011; Brady 2014b, 2022; Ciccarelli 2014; Nomikos 2018;
Fudge 2021).</p>

<p>
The question of our future response to humanly damaged environments is
not merely a question of psychology, but also a normative one (Parsons
2023b). Assuming it is possible to set aside the moral taint of the
&ldquo;Anthropocene world&rdquo;, <em>should</em> we do so? The
question echoes a familiar debate concerning the appreciation of
&ldquo;morally tainted&rdquo; artworks (Gaut 2013). A traditional view
holds that moral considerations are distinct from, and not relevant
to, the aesthetic evaluations of an artwork. Others argue that setting
aside a novel&rsquo;s racism when evaluating its aesthetic value would
be a kind of conceptual mistake. We may raise the analogous question:
Would ignoring the moral taint of the degraded environments of the
Anthropocene be a similar sort of error?</p>

<p>
Some see here not only an aesthetic, but a moral error. One view, for
instance, holds that finding beauty in the environmental damage
brought about by our negligent practices represents a tacit approval
and encouragement of those very practices (Foster 1992). An
alternative position, in contrast, is that such appreciation is
morally innocuous and may in fact make us <em>more</em> responsive to
environmental issues (Alcaraz Le&oacute;n 2011; Brady 2014b, 2022).
This debate grapples with an issue&mdash;how our aesthetic attitudes
might shape future treatment of our environment&mdash;that is as
difficult as it is important, entangling us not only in philosophy but
also with still unsettled matters of empirical psychology and
environmental science. As is characteristic of the questions posed by
environmental aesthetics, a shift from the familiar experience of art
to our responses to the wider world around us at once complicates the
theoretical issues and vastly raises the stakes.</p>
