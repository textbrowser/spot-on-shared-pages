<h1>Primitivist Theories of Truth</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Oct 23, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
When thinking about truth, it is natural to wonder whether and how
truth can be analyzed in more fundamental terms. Numerous philosophers
have aimed to so analyze truth, but their theories are all plagued by
well-known problems. As a result, none has generated consensus, or
even near consensus, among philosophers. Primitivists about truth
offer a distinctive take on this situation. They suggest that this
negative outcome shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, as there are strong
reasons for thinking that truth simply cannot be analyzed in more
fundamental terms. We may be able to so analyze other aspects of
reality, and some of these may even be analyzable in terms of truth.
Primitivists insist, though, that when it comes to truth itself, this
sort of analysis will always come up short.</p>

<p>
This entry will start by outlining a tripartite distinction between
the concept of truth, the property of truth, and the terms that we use
in speaking about truth. This distinction is standard within debates
about truth, and it will inform the rest of the entry. The entry will
then provide an overview of the major varieties of primitivism about
truth, covering historically significant developments of the view as
well as developments by contemporary philosophers. Following this
overview, the entry will trace some nuanced connections between
primitivist theories and identity, deflationary, and axiomatic
theories of truth. It will close with a brief discussion of the
empirical significance of primitivism, focusing on how the results of
studies on false belief attribution bear on primitivist theories of
the concept of truth.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="ConProTer">1. Concept, property, terms</h2>

<p>
Theories of truth can have a number of different targets. Three of the
most prominent targets have been: (i) the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>
(we&rsquo;ll denote concepts using small caps
in what follows); (ii) the property <em>truth</em> (we&rsquo;ll denote
properties using italics); and (iii) the <em>truth terms</em> that
speakers use.</p>

<p>
Philosophers have thought about the nature of the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>
(and concepts in general) in various ways.
According to one standard way of thinking about the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>,
whatever else we might want to say about its
nature and possession-conditions, <span class="sc">truth</span> is a
mental entity of some sort that thinkers deploy whenever they have
thoughts involving truth. For instance, if I believe that some of the
things that Laurence said about T.S. Eliot are true, then it would be
standardly held that I deploy the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>
in having this belief. Likewise, I would
deploy <span class="sc">truth</span> if I wondered whether most of the
statements in a late-night infomercial were true or hoped that a
scientist&rsquo;s optimistic predictions about climate change turn out
to be true. This way of thinking about <span class="sc">truth</span>
will surface in
 <a href="#WanChoDeFacPri">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#TruTarMea">&sect;&sect;3.1&ndash;3.3</a>,
 <a href="#PriDisAle">&sect;&sect;3.5&ndash;3.7</a>,
 <a href="#PriDefTheTru">&sect;4.2</a>,
 and
 <a href="#EmpSigPriFalBelAtt">&sect;5</a>
 below. In
 <a href="#GotFrePriAboTru">&sect;2.4</a>,
 by contrast, we will see that one of the most famous primitivists
about <span class="sc">truth</span>, Gottlob Frege, conceived of the
concept <span class="sc">truth</span> in an importantly different
way.</p>

<p>
The property <em>truth</em> is meant to be the property that is
possessed by all and only the true truth-bearers. For instance,
suppose that propositions (somehow construed) are the bearers of
truth. The proposition that Morocco is north of Liberia is true, so
this proposition possesses the property <em>truth</em>. By contrast,
the proposition that Zambia is north of Chad is not true, so this
proposition fails to possess the property <em>truth</em>.</p>

<p>
Philosophers who have developed metaphysics of truth standardly aim to
identify the nature of the property <em>truth</em>. That said, in some
instances, it may be more helpful to describe a theory of the
metaphysics of truth as investigating the nature of a relation, rather
than a property. A well-known example is
 <a href="../truth-correspondence/">correspondence theories</a>
 of truth, which take truth to consist in some particular relation of
correspondence between a truth-bearer such as a belief or a
proposition and portion of reality such as a fact. Another sensible
way of describing correspondence theories, however, is to take them to
investigate the nature of the property <em>truth,</em> where
<em>truth</em> is meant to be a <em>relational property</em> (see,
e.g., the introduction to the entry on
 <a href="../truth-correspondence/">the correspondence theory of truth</a>
 and Edwards 2021). In what follows, we will set this issue to one
side and refer to <em>truth</em> simply as a &lsquo;property&rsquo;.
(For further discussion of the concept-property distinction in work on
truth, see Alston 2002; Asay 2013c: ch. 1, 2020: &sect;6.1, 2021a, b;
Edwards 2018: ch. 2, 2021; Eklund 2021: &sect;2; Lynch 2009: ch. 1;
Nulty 2008; Scharp 2021; Wyatt 2018, 2021; and the references
therein.)</p>

<p>
Truth terms are, in essence, the linguistic expressions that enable us
to speak about truth. In English, truth terms include the familiar
&lsquo;true&rsquo; and &lsquo;truth&rsquo;. They also include
&lsquo;correct&rsquo;, &lsquo;incorrect&rsquo;, &lsquo;right&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, when the latter are used in certain
sentences, such as &lsquo;Harold believes that vaccines cause autism,
but his belief is wrong/incorrect, since vaccines don&rsquo;t cause
autism&rsquo;. Other natural languages come with their own stocks of
truth terms. (For discussions of truth terms in various languages and
references to further resources, see, e.g., Mizumoto 2022, 2024;
Reuter 2024; and Wyatt &amp; Ulatowski 2024.)</p>

<p>
As will become apparent, this basic distinction between <span class="sc">truth</span>,
<em>truth</em>, and truth terms proves to be
very useful when carving up the landscape of primitivist truth
theories and when identifying connections between primitivist theories
and truth theories of other kinds.</p>

<h2 id="EarPriThe">2. Early primitivist theories</h2>

<h3 id="WanChoDeFacPri">2.1 Wang Chong and <em lang="la">de facto</em> primitivism</h3>

<p>
Primitivist theories of truth were discussed extensively during the
early years of the analytic tradition in philosophy, and we will focus
on these theories in
 <a href="#GEMooPriAboTru">&sect;&sect;2.2&ndash;2.4</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Prior to this period, we see primitivist ideas about truth emerge in
Western philosophy, though they appear only in an inchoate form.
Descartes, for instance, wrote in a letter to Mersenne on 16 October
1639 that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for my part, I have never had any doubts about truth, because it seems
a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of
it&hellip;no logical definition can be given which will help anyone to
discover its nature. (1991: 139)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, Johann Heinrich Lambert proposed in 1771 that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]ruth is a simple concept which, as it does not have several
internal marks, can at best be defined or elucidated only through its
relations to other concepts. (quoted in K&uuml;nne 2003: 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we go back much further in the history of philosophy, we encounter
an early Chinese philosopher whose body of thought about truth may
exemplify a kind of primitivism. This philosopher is Wang Chong (c.
25&ndash;100 CE). Wang lived during the Han period, which Alexus
McLeod (2018b: 134) has dubbed &ldquo;the period of concern with truth
and method in Chinese thought&rdquo;. Wang&rsquo;s writings address a
diverse array of topics, including astronomy, physics, ethics,
metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical methodology; for a
thorough discussion, see McLeod (2018b).</p>

<p>
The only extant volume of Wang&rsquo;s writings is entitled
<em>Lunheng</em> (for an overview of Wang&rsquo;s life and his
writings, see McLeod 2018b: ch. 2). In <em>Duizuo</em>, the second
chapter of <em>Lunheng</em>, Wang explains that no matter the subject
that he is addressing, his inquiry is animated by a foundational
concern for truth (1907: 85):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In a great many books reality has no place left: falsehood and
immorality triumph over truth and virtue. Therefore, unless such lies
be censured, specious arguments cannot be suppressed, and, as long as
they spread, truth does not reign. For this reason, the [Lunheng]
weighs the words, whether they be light or heavy, and holds up a
balance for truth and falsehood. It does not trouble about polishing
the phrases and embellishing the style, or consider this of great
importance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Wang indicates, he was troubled by the fact that falsehoods can
spread more effectively than truths. One of the main reasons that this
occurs, according to Wang, is that someone who wishes to spread a
falsehood often expresses it using vivid, flowery language that is
meant to generate strong emotions among their audience. To combat this
phenomenon, Wang resolves to avoid flowery language and to instead
express his ideas and arguments as straightforwardly as possible.
This, he contends, will enable his readers to more effectively acquire
true beliefs and avoid false beliefs.</p>

<p>
Given Wang&rsquo;s serious concern with truth, it is important to
consider how Wang speaks about truth when articulating his views.
Interestingly, Wang regularly uses three pairs of truth terms: <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shi/fei</em>
&#26159;&#38750;, <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ran/fou</em>
&#28982;&#21542;, and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">SHI/xu</em>
&#23526;&#34395;. When discussing
Wang&rsquo;s views on truth, McLeod (2018b: ch. 4) translates <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shi</em>
and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fei</em>
as &lsquo;right&rsquo; and &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ran</em>
and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fou</em>
as &lsquo;is the case&rsquo; and &lsquo;is not the case&rsquo;, and
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">SHI</em> and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xu</em>
as &lsquo;true&rsquo; and
&lsquo;false&rsquo;. A somewhat different translation is offered by
Lajos Brons (2018), who translates these pairs of terms as
&lsquo;right&rsquo; and &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, &lsquo;is the case&rsquo;
and &lsquo;is not the case&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;objective/objectivity&rsquo; and &lsquo;mere attractive
appearance&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
As always, translation is a tricky business, especially when
attempting to translate an ancient text into a contemporary language
such as English. Without attempting to settle upon a definitive
translation of the truth terms that Wang uses, we can note a few key
passages from <em>Lunheng</em> in which these pairs of truth terms
occur, using McLeod&rsquo;s translation for the sake of
convenience:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Lunheng uses precise language and detailed discussion, to reveal
and explain the doubts of this generation of common people, to bring
to light through debate right and wrong principles
(&#26159;&#38750;&#20043;&#29702; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shi fei
zhi li</em>), and to help those who come later clearly see the
difference between what is the case (&#28982; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ran</em>)
and what is not the case (&#21542; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fou</em>).
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Duizuo</em>
6, quoted by McLeod 2018b, 146)</p>

<p>
Those who can determine what is the case (&#28982; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ran</em>)
and what is not the case (&#21542; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fou</em>)
feel an ailment in their hearts which
pain them [at the thought of truth being subverted by the
&ldquo;common people&rdquo; and flowery scholarship] &hellip;
[Mengzi&rsquo;s] language was straight and to the point, according
high place to the right (&#26159; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shi</em>)
and suppressing the wrong (&#38750; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">fei</em>).
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Duizuo</em>
2, quoted by McLeod 2018b:
145&ndash;146)</p>

<p>
When the ruler does badly, instruction to change conduct is directed
toward the person on high. When the ruler&rsquo;s subjects are
doltish, engaging in discussions is directed toward the people below.
When the people below obtain the truth (&#23526; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">SHI</em>),
then instruction of the person on
high follows. I hope to stir some of these minds, to help them
distinguish between truth (&#23526; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">SHI</em>)
and falsity (&#34395; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xu</em>).
Once the distinction between truth and
falsity is established, then flowery and artificial writings can be
eliminated. When flowery and artificial writings are eliminated, pure
and sincere transformations will grow more abundant day by day. (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Duizuo</em>
2, quoted by McLeod 2018b: 148)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As these passages illustrate, Wang uses these three pairs of truth
terms when developing his ideas about topics such as principles,
scholarship, and social and political progress. Notably, however, Wang
never attempts to <em>define</em> these truth terms or otherwise
elucidate their meanings. This fact has led Lajos Brons to propose
that Wang is best interpreted as being a primitivist about truth. He
offers the following argument:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he fact that [Wang]&mdash;in a book in which truth plays such a
central role&mdash;never even hinted at what truth is or what <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shi</em>,
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ran</em>, or
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">SHI</em> mean strongly suggests that he
(implicitly!) considered truth to be primitive. (Brons 2018: 357)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
McLeod (2018b: 163) points to a significant difficulty for this
argument. He notes that while Wang doesn&rsquo;t attempt to define or
otherwise analyze the meanings of the truth terms that he uses, this
isn&rsquo;t terribly surprising. This is because early Chinese
philosophers generally don&rsquo;t aim to define the central
philosophical terms that they use. Instead, they rely on other methods
such as the use of case studies to illustrate what these terms mean
and why the phenomena that they pick out are significant. Rather than
inferring from this that implicit primitivism was widespread among
early Chinese philosophers, the more reasonable proposal may be that
there are simply deep methodological differences between early Chinese
philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy.</p>

<p>
In later postscript, Brons grants that we lack sufficient reasons for
taking Wang to explicitly or implicitly endorse a primitivist view of
truth. Nevertheless, Brons suggests that there is an interesting sense
in which Wang&rsquo;s body of thought about truth exhibits a kind of
primitivism. Brons calls this variety of primitivism &lsquo;<em lang="la">de
facto</em> primitivism&rsquo; about truth. Focusing for
the sake of simplicity on the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>,
the idea is that a body of thought exhibits <em lang="la">de
facto</em> primitivism if one can endorse that body of thought without
being committed to the definability of <span class="sc">truth</span>,
even though the body of thought does not entail that <span class="sc">truth</span>
is <em>undefinable</em> (Brons 2018: 366).
This, Brons proposes, is precisely what we find in <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Lunheng</em>:
a set of interrelated ideas
expressed using <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shi/fei</em>
&#26159;&#38750;, <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ran/fou</em>
&#28982;&#21542;, and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">SHI/xu</em>
&#23526;&#34395; which doesn&rsquo;t entail that the concepts
expressed by these terms are undefinable but which one can
nevertheless endorse without taking these concepts to be amenable to
definition. In
 <a href="#PriAxiTheTru">&sect;4.3</a>,
 we will see an additional context in which the notion of <em lang="la">de
facto</em> primitivism can be put to use. (For further
discussion of Wang&rsquo;s views about truth, see McLeod 2016: ch. 6,
2018a, 2018b, ch. 4 and Mou 2018a, 2018b: &sect;5.3.)</p>

<h3 id="GEMooPriAboTru">2.2 G.E. Moore&rsquo;s primitivism about <em>truth</em></h3>

<p>
Having discussed Brons&rsquo; primitivist interpretation of Wang
Chong, we can move forward many years in the history of philosophy to
the period when primitivist theories of truth first garnered sustained
interest as such. At the advent of the analytic tradition, we find
several of the tradition&rsquo;s leading
 lights&mdash;<a href="../moore/">G.E. Moore</a>,
 <a href="../russell/">Bertrand Russell</a>,
 and
 <a href="../frege/">Gottlob Frege</a>&mdash;developing
 distinctive primitivist theories of truth.</p>

<p>
In his classic essay &ldquo;The nature of judgment&rdquo; (1899),
Moore aims to show that contra
 <a href="../bradley/">F.H. Bradley</a>,
 the truth or falsity of a proposition cannot depend upon the
proposition&rsquo;s relation to (non-propositional) reality. (This
essay was largely extracted from Moore&rsquo;s 1898 dissertation
&ldquo;The metaphysical basis of ethics&rdquo;, for which see Moore
2011.) Moore takes propositions to be composed of what he calls
&lsquo;concepts&rsquo;. The notion of a concept which Moore uses in
this essay is notably different from the notion that we briefly
detailed in
 <a href="#ConProTer">&sect;1</a>,
 according to which concepts are mental entities of some sort. Moore
explicitly denies that concepts, in his sense, are mental, saying that
&ldquo;[t]he concept is not a mental fact, nor any part of a mental
fact&rdquo; (1899: 179). Instead, Moore takes concepts to be
immutable, extramental entities which are the constituents of
propositions and are also what we mean in speaking and thinking (1899:
178, 180). He also insists that we cannot explain the nature of
concepts in terms of entities of some other kind, describing concepts
as a &ldquo;<em lang="la">genus per se</em>, irreducible to anything
else&rdquo; (1899: 178&ndash;179). Interestingly, then, the early
Moore favors a primitivist view of concepts as well as a primitivist
view of truth. (For further discussion of Moore&rsquo;s early work in
metaphysics, see Baldwin 1990: chs. 1&ndash;2.)</p>

<p>
Moore argues (1899: 180) that if the truth of a proposition consisted
in its relation to reality, then it would follow that, contrary to
fact, concepts can be true or false. For instance, Moore contends that
this view of truth entails that the concept <span class="sc">red</span>
is true and the concept <span class="sc">chimera</span>
is false, since there are real things (viz.
red things) to which <span class="sc">red</span> is related, though
there are no real things to which <span class="sc">chimera</span> is
related.</p>

<p>
Additionally, Moore suggests that there are in fact true propositions
that stand in no relation to reality, using the proposition that 2+2=4
as an example. These considerations lead Moore to conclude that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[a] proposition is constituted by any number of concepts, together
with a specific relation between them; and according to the nature of
this relation the proposition may be either true or false. What kind
of relation makes a proposition true, what false, cannot be further
defined, but must be immediately recognised. (1899: 180)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, we see Moore advancing the view that <em>truth</em> and
<em>falsity</em> are primitive properties/relations. In what follows,
we will call the view that <em>truth</em> is a primitive property
<em>metaphysical
 primitivism</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In lectures that were delivered in 1910&ndash;1911 and published later
as <em>Some Main Problems of Philosophy</em>, Moore went on to reject
metaphysical primitivism in favor of a correspondence theory of truth
(see the entry on
 <a href="../truth-correspondence/">the correspondence theory</a>).
 Here, Moore develops two concerns for metaphysical primitivism which
respectively concern his account of the facts to which true beliefs
refer and the analysis of belief on which he takes metaphysical
primitivism to rest (1953: 262&ndash;263). Wyatt (2022: 3) details
some additional concerns that affect Moore&rsquo;s argument for
metaphysical primitivism.</p>

<h3 id="BerRusPriAboTru">2.3 Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s primitivism about <em>truth</em></h3>

<p>
During the period in which Moore endorsed and later abandoned
metaphysical primitivism, Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s views on truth
followed much the same trajectory. In Russell (1904), the third in a
trio of papers prompted by the work of
 <a href="../meinong/">Alexius Meinong</a>,
 Russell&rsquo;s main aim is to defend the view that all judgments
have &ldquo;transcendent&rdquo; objects, which Russell calls
&ldquo;propositions&rdquo;. This view carries a commitment to both
true and false propositions, and Russell worries about whether the
latter in fact exist. After wrestling with this and numerous nearby
issues, Russell ultimately forwards an arresting proposal that would
fit perfectly in the early work of Moore:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is no problem at all in truth and falsehood&hellip;some
propositions are true and some false, just as some roses are red and
some white&hellip;[w]hat is truth, and what falsehood, we must merely
apprehend, for both seem incapable of analysis. (1904:
523&ndash;524)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a paper that he appears to have read to the Jowett Society in 1905,
Russell is mainly concerned to argue that propositions are the bearers
of truth and falsity and that true propositions are facts. Along the
way, he twice (1905 [1994: 493&ndash;494, 504]) maintains that
<em>truth</em> is undefinable, offering an argument that is strikingly
similar to Frege&rsquo;s treadmill argument
 (<a href="#GotFrePriAboTru">&sect;2.4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A pivotal juncture in Russell&rsquo;s thought about truth is his
1906/7 paper &lsquo;On the nature of truth&rsquo;. This paper consists
mostly of a critical discussion of the &lsquo;monistic theory of
truth&rsquo;, which Russell attributes to the
 <a href="../idealism/#BritAmerIdea">British idealist</a>
 Harold Joachim. Having thoroughly criticized the monistic theory,
Russell aims in the paper&rsquo;s final section to offer some positive
remarks about the nature of <em>truth</em>. Here, his mind is clearly
divided between two views. The first is a primitivist theory according
to which</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>the bearers of <em>truth</em> are complex, non-mental entities,
which Russell calls &lsquo;propositions&rsquo;;</li>

<li><em>facts</em> are true propositions and
<em>fictions</em>/<em>objective falsehoods</em> false propositions;
and</li>

<li>&ldquo;[t]ruth and falsehood&hellip;are ultimate, and no account
can be given of what makes a proposition true or false&rdquo; (Russell
1906/7: 48).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second view is a correspondence theory of truth according to
which</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>the bearers of <em>truth</em> are beliefs;</li>

<li>facts are the only non-mental complexes, so that objective
falsehoods don&rsquo;t exist; and</li>

<li>true beliefs are those which correspond to facts.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Russell suggests (1906/7: 49) that both of these theories &ldquo;seem
tenable&rdquo; and leaves the decision between them to future
work.</p>

<p>
That decision comes in Russell (1907 [1910]). Here, Russell rejects
metaphysical primitivism for three reasons. First, the metaphysical
primitivist, as Russell conceives of them, takes the primary bearers
of <em>truth</em> to be propositions. In opposition to this view,
Russell argues that we would do well to avoid positing propositions as
&ldquo;independent [entities]&rdquo; and thus as the primary bearers
of <em>truth</em> (1907 [1910: 175]). If propositions exist as
independent entities, Russell contends, then it must be the case that
propositions are the referents of that-clauses such as &lsquo;that
Charles I died on the scaffold&rsquo;. However, Russell is highly
skeptical of referential analyses of that-clauses, suggesting that a
that-clause &ldquo;has no complete meaning by itself, which would
enable it to denote a definite object as (e.g.) the word
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; does&rdquo; (1907 [1910: 175]). Russell grants
that this is not a knockdown argument against the view that
propositions exist as independent entities, insisting nevertheless
that &ldquo;it must be allowed a certain weight&rdquo; (1907 [1910:
176]).</p>

<p>
Russell&rsquo;s second concern for metaphysical primitivism, which he
takes to be &ldquo;more fatal&rdquo; (1907 [1910: 176]), arises from
the fact that the metaphysical primitivist posits objective
falsehoods. Russell finds objective falsehoods ontologically
problematic, given that they would exist independently of minds, yet
&ldquo;we feel that there could be no falsehood if there were no minds
to make mistakes&rdquo; (1907 [1910: 176]). This may be a significant
concern for metaphysical primitivism. One thing that should be noted,
however, is that if the concern is forceful, it would seem to cast
doubt on any theory of truth which entails that there are objective
falsehoods, irrespective of whether that theory takes <em>falsity</em>
to be a primitive property.</p>

<p>
Russell&rsquo;s third concern is also meant to be fatal for
metaphysical primitivism, and it centers on the metaphysical
primitivist&rsquo;s contention that <em>truth</em> and
<em>falsity</em> are primitive properties. Insofar as it entails that
<em>truth</em> and <em>falsity</em> are primitive, Russell argues,
metaphysical primitivism renders the distinction between
<em>truth</em> and <em>falsity</em> highly mysterious, whereas the
correspondence theory that Russell has in mind can arguably shed a
great deal of light on this distinction (1907 [1910: 176]).
Russell&rsquo;s third concern continues to trouble philosophers
considering metaphysical primitivism; for further discussion, see
Wyatt (2022: &sect;3.1).</p>

<p>
This shift in Russell&rsquo;s thinking about truth away from
primitivism and towards correspondence proved to be permanent.
Russell&rsquo;s endorsement of the view that <em>truth</em>&mdash;or
more specifically, the truth of empirical beliefs and
sentences&mdash;consists in correspondence persisted for the remainder
of his life, though he articulated this view in various importantly
different ways (see the entry on
 <a href="../truth-correspondence/">the correspondence theory</a>,
 as well as Russell 1912: ch. XII, 1914: 54, 1919a, 1919b: &sect;VI,
1921: ch. XIII, 1927: ch. 24, 1940: chs. XVI, XVII, and XXI, 1946:
849&ndash;850, 852, 853&ndash;854, 856, 1948: Part II, chs.
8&ndash;11, 1959: 63&ndash;64, 132, 151, 157, 213, 220, ch. XV.)</p>

<h3 id="GotFrePriAboTru">2.4 Gottlob Frege&rsquo;s primitivism about <span class="sc">truth</span></h3>

<p>
The third early analytic philosopher to endorse primitivism was
Gottlob Frege, and unlike Moore and Russell, he remained an enduring
advocate of the view. Frege develops what is perhaps the best-known
argument for primitivism, which Wolfgang K&uuml;nne (2003:
&sect;3.3.2) helpfully calls the <em>treadmill argument</em>. The name
of this argument references a metaphor that Frege uses in the
posthumously published essay &ldquo;Logic&rdquo;, which was likely
written in 1897. In this essay, he discusses the view that
propositions are private and mental and are true just when they stand
in a relation to a distinct entity that is neither private nor
 mental.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Frege (&ldquo;Logic&rdquo; [1979: 134]) contends that given this
view, we could not know whether a proposition is true, as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we should be in the position of a man on a treadmill who makes a step
forwards and upwards, but the step he treads on keeps giving way and
he falls back to where he was before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Frege&rsquo;s argument for this claim (&ldquo;Logic&rdquo; [1979:
128&ndash;129]) goes by very quickly, but the argument receives a
fuller development in Frege&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;The
thought&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The more developed argument appears in the following widely discussed
passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Can it not be laid down that truth exists when there is correspondence
in a certain respect? But in which? For what would we then have to do
to decide whether something were true? We should have to inquire
whether it were true that an idea and a reality, perhaps, corresponded
in the laid-down respect. And then we should be confronted by a
question of the same kind and the game could begin again. So the
attempt to explain truth as correspondence collapses. And every other
attempt to define truth collapses too. For in a definition certain
characteristics would have to be stated. And in application to any
particular case the question would always arise whether it were true
that the characteristics were present. So one goes round in a circle.
Consequently, it is probable that the content of the word
&ldquo;true&rdquo; is unique and indefinable. (Frege 1918&ndash;1919
[1956: 291])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the beginning of this passage, Frege offers reasons for thinking
that the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>, i.e. the content of
the word &lsquo;true&rsquo;, cannot be defined as involving some kind
of correspondence. He then suggests that for similar reasons, every
purported definition of <span class="sc">truth</span> must fail, which
shows that <span class="sc">truth</span> is &ldquo;unique and
indefinable&rdquo;. We will call the view that <span class="sc">truth</span>
is a primitive concept, which Frege endorses
here, <em>conceptual primitivism</em>.</p>

<p>
One detail that should be flagged in connection with the treadmill
argument pertains to Frege&rsquo;s views about concepts. We noted in
 <a href="#ConProTer">&sect;1</a>
 that the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> is often understood to
be mental in nature, and as we will see in
 <a href="#ConPriThe">&sect;3</a>,
 most conceptual primitivists have either adopted this understanding
of <span class="sc">truth</span> or else appear sympathetic towards
it. Frege, however, has a distinctive understanding of what sort of
entity the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> is. As Frege uses the
term, concepts are functions from objects to truth-values (see Frege
1891, 1892). For Frege, then, concepts are mathematical in nature, and
they are also non-mental. Thus, when Frege forwards the view that the
concept <span class="sc">truth</span> is primitive, it is the concept
<span class="sc">truth</span> so conceived that he has in mind.</p>

<p>
There has been substantial scholarly disagreement about how, exactly,
the treadmill argument should be interpreted (see Asay 2013a:
&sect;&sect;3&ndash;4, 2013c: chs. 2, 5&ndash;6, 2021a: &sect;&sect;1,
3.3, 2021b: &sect;4.1.1; Baldwin 1997; Johnston 2021; Heck &amp; May
2018: &sect;5; Green 2024; Kim 2020, 2021; K&uuml;nne 2008; Pardey
2012; Ricketts &amp; Levine 1996; Sluga 2002; Walker 1997: &sect;6;
and the references therein. For an interesting adaptation of the
treadmill, see Trueman 2022: &sect;1.3.) The central issue here is
whether we should take the argument to involve an appeal to an
allegedly vicious <em>regress</em> or allegedly vicious
<em>circularity</em>. Given the prominence of this debate, it is
worthwhile to outline these two versions of the argument in
detail.</p>

<p>
According to the regress interpretation, the treadmill&rsquo;s
structure is essentially this (cp. K&uuml;nne 2003:
130&ndash;131):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em nobottommargin">

<p>

<dd>It is not the case that <span class="sc">truth</span> is defined
in terms of some characteristic <em>C</em> [(5<sub>C</sub>),
(6<sub>C</sub>)]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Selecting one of these interpretations of the treadmill is a delicate
matter to be sure. Whichever way the treadmill is interpreted, though,
it faces some significant concerns. To illustrate, suppose that I
offer the following simple definition of <span class="sc">truth</span><strong>:</strong></p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(Corr)</dt>
<dd>For all \(x\): <span class="sc">truth</span> applies to \(x
=_{\textrm{df}} x\) corresponds to a fact.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If I want to know whether a particular entity <em>a</em> is true, then
(Corr) suggests that I should ask whether <em>a</em> corresponds to a
fact. Frege will claim (recall
 <a href="#st3R">(2<sub>R</sub>)</a>/<a href="#st2c">(2<sub>C</sub>)</a>
 above) that to determine whether <em>a</em> corresponds to a fact, I
must <em>first</em> determine whether the proposition that <em>a</em>
corresponds to a fact is true. However, this claim is certainly
debatable. To know whether <em>a</em> corresponds to a fact, it would
seem that I need to know only the following things:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>which entity <em>a</em> is;</li>

<li>what the correspondence relation <em>C</em> is;</li>

<li>what facts are; and</li>

<li>whether there exists a fact <em>f</em> to which <em>a</em> stands
in <em>C</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This isn&rsquo;t to deny, of course, that the proposition that
<em>a</em> corresponds to a fact is logically equivalent to the
proposition that (the proposition that <em>a</em> corresponds to a
fact) is true. Yet even if these propositions are logically
equivalent, that doesn&rsquo;t show that the latter is epistemically
prior to the former. If it isn&rsquo;t, then the treadmill looks to
falter at
 <a href="#st3R">(2<sub>R</sub>)</a>/<a href="#st2c">(2<sub>C</sub>)</a>.
 (For an especially nice articulation of this concern, see Asay 2013c:
&sect;5.1. For a related discussion of Frege&rsquo;s conception of
judgment and the role that it is meant to play in the treadmill, see
Kim 2021.)</p>

<h2 id="ConPriThe">3. Contemporary primitivist theories</h2>

<h3 id="TruTarMea">3.1 Truth, Tarski, and meaning</h3>

<p>
Debates about truth continued to be very lively throughout the
twentieth century and have maintained a great deal of momentum during
the twenty-first century. In the twentieth century, the most visible
advocates of primitivism were Donald Davidson (1983, 1990a, b, 1995,
1996, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2020) and Ernest Sosa (1993a, b, 2001), who
both defended versions of conceptual primitivism. (See also Rorty
2000: 126, Savery 1955: 514, and Strawson 1992: 24, as well as Sluga
1999&rsquo;s discussion of Carnap&rsquo;s views about truth.)</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s advocacy of primitivism was heavily informed by his
admiration for the work of
 <a href="../tarski/">Alfred Tarski</a>
 and his sense that Tarski had proved that the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>
is undefinable. Davidson (1990b:
285&ndash;286) observes that in developing his theory of truth, Tarski
defines various truth predicates each of which is meant to apply to
sentences from a particular language <em>L</em>. By contrast, Tarski
doesn&rsquo;t attempt to define a <em>fully general</em> truth
predicate which is meant to apply to sentences from any arbitrary
language whatsoever. The explanation for this, Davidson contends, is
that Tarski proved that no such predicate can be defined. Davidson
takes this Tarskian proof to show by extension that our concept <span class="sc">truth</span>,
which is meant to be fully general in the
above sense, is also undefinable.</p>

<p>
In a much-cited passage, Davidson (1996 [2005: 20&ndash;21])
summarizes the central lesson that he takes from Tarski&rsquo;s work
as follows (see also Davidson 1977 [1984: 216], 1983 [2001: 139]):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For the most part, the concepts philosophers single out for attention,
like truth, knowledge, belief, action, cause, the good and the right,
are the most elementary concepts we have&hellip;Why then should we
expect to be able to reduce these concepts definitionally to other
concepts that are simpler, clearer, and more basic? We should accept
the fact that what makes these concepts so important must also
foreclose on the possibility of finding a foundation for them which
reaches deeper into bedrock.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
We should apply this obvious observation to the concept of truth: we
cannot hope to underpin it with something more transparent or easier
to grasp. Truth is, as G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and Frege
maintained, and Tarski proved, an indefinable concept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Using a primitive concept <span class="sc">truth</span>, Davidson went
on to develop a program in semantics whose influence cannot be
overstated. A central idea of this program is that the meaning of a
linguistic expression consists in its contribution to the
truth-conditions of the sentences in which it occurs. This idea is
also based on the work of Tarski, who explored definitions of truth
based on biconditionals such as:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>&lsquo;Morocco is north of Liberia&rsquo; is true iff Morocco is
north of Liberia.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s approach is to treat a Tarskian theory of truth as
being a theory of what the sentences that are used by a particular
speaker mean. If (1) is entailed by such a theory, which is attributed
to a particular speaker <em>A</em>, then the theory also entails that
when <em>A</em> uses the sentence &lsquo;Morocco is north of
Liberia&rsquo;, <em>A</em> means that Morocco is north of Liberia
(see, e.g., Davidson 1977, and cp. Davidson 2020).</p>

<p>
This proposal regarding the relationship between truth and meaning
illustrates a more general feature of the methodology for
investigating <span class="sc">truth</span> that Davidson ultimately
came to endorse. This method has it that instead of trying to analyze
<span class="sc">truth</span> in terms of more basic concepts, we
should instead attempt to identify significant connections between
<span class="sc">truth</span> and other concepts that we use. One such
connection is that between <span class="sc">truth</span> and <span class="sc">meaning</span>,
which Davidson takes his application of
Tarski&rsquo;s ideas to reveal. P.F. Strawson (1992: ch. 2) helpfully
describes this approach as the <em>connective model</em> of conceptual
analysis. For further discussion of Davidson&rsquo;s methodology and
the ways in which he applies it, see the entry on
 <a href="../davidson/">Donald Davidson</a>
 and Glanzberg (2013).</p>

<p>
A significant concern for Davidson is that while Tarski&rsquo;s work
on truth undoubtedly marks a watershed moment in the history of
philosophy, it is not at all clear that Tarski proved that <span class="sc">truth</span>
is a primitive concept. The theorem concerning
truth that Tarski proved concerns specific formal languages. Described
in rudimentary terms, the theorem has it that if a formal language
<em>L</em> has a particular degree of expressive power, then truth for
the sentences of <em>L</em> cannot be defined in <em>L</em>. This
theorem is about truth predicates for specific kinds of formal
languages, rather than <span class="sc">truth</span>, which is meant
to be a concept that is possessed by speakers of a highly diverse
range of natural languages. For this reason, Tarski&rsquo;s
undefinability theorem doesn&rsquo;t provide clear support for
conceptual
 primitivism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Yet even if this is so, Davidson&rsquo;s understanding of the import
of Tarski&rsquo;s work may still point us in the right direction. A
notable view in the vicinity of Davidson&rsquo;s is that while Tarski
didn&rsquo;t exactly prove that <span class="sc">truth</span> is
primitive, Tarski&rsquo;s views about truth fit more naturally with
conceptual primitivism than with other theories of <span class="sc">truth</span>,
such as correspondence or
 <a href="../truth-deflationary/">deflationary</a>
 theories. (For a defense of this view and the above criticism of
Davidson, see Asay 2013b, 2013c: ch. 7. For further discussion of
Tarski&rsquo;s thought about truth, see Halbach 2011: chs. 1, 3;
Horsten 2011: chs. 2&ndash;4; Patterson 2012: 144&ndash;160; and the

<h3 id="TruEpiExtRea">3.2 Truth, epistemology, and external realism</h3>

<p>
Ernest Sosa (2001: 659) has sided with Davidson in holding that
&ldquo;[t]ruth is a primitive concept and has no illuminating
definition or Moorean analysis&rdquo;. Sosa&rsquo;s ambition in his
discussions of conceptual primitivism is to provide an account of
truth that (i) is compatible with a <em>truth-centered
epistemology</em> according to which epistemic concepts such as <span class="sc">knowledge</span>
and <span class="sc">epistemic
justification</span> must be analyzed in terms of <span class="sc">truth</span>
and (ii) is compatible with <em>external
realism</em>, according to which</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
external reality&hellip;is not dependent on human thought, and might
have been just as it is now even in our absence, and even in the
absence of any contingent thinkers whatever. (2001: 643)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sosa argues for conceptual primitivism by elimination, offering
various concerns for competing accounts of truth, including
noncognitivist, pragmatist, and correspondence theories. The
noncognitivist account that Sosa discusses is based in the work of
 <a href="../rorty/">Richard Rorty</a>,
 who maintained that the word &lsquo;true&rsquo; is &ldquo;merely an
expression of commendation&rdquo; (Rorty 1991: 23). The corresponding
account of the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> has it that the
sole function of <span class="sc">truth</span> is to commend beliefs,
theories, assertions, etc. with which one agrees. Against this
account, Sosa points out that it seems to succumb to the
 <a href="../moral-cognitivism/#EmbeProb">embedding problem</a>
 that is standardly raised against noncognitivist theories. For
instance, consider the belief that if what Barry said about Susan is
true, then Susan will come to the dinner party. In forming this
belief, I deploy <span class="sc">truth</span>. However, it would seem
that in doing so, I don&rsquo;t commend what Barry said, or anything
else for that matter (see also Sosa 2001: 649, and see Schroeder 2010
for further discussion of expressivism about truth).</p>

<p>
The pragmatist account of <span class="sc">truth</span> that Sosa
considers is based in the thought of
 <a href="../peirce/">C.S. Peirce</a>.
 A proponent of this account aims to explicate <span class="sc">truth</span>
by proposing that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a true belief [is] one that would be accepted rationally and
justifiably by ideal inquirers in an ideal epistemic situation for
that belief and its subject matter. (Sosa 2001: 642)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This account explicates <span class="sc">truth</span> using the
concepts <span class="sc">rationality</span> and <span class="sc">epistemic
justification</span>. Accordingly, Sosa points
out that a defender of the account faces the challenge of analyzing
the latter concepts in truth-free terms, lest they be caught up in
vicious circularity. While this sort of project may have some
potential, undertaking it is clearly a tall order, given that it seems
highly natural to analyze <span class="sc">rationality</span> and
<span class="sc">epistemic justification</span> in terms of <span class="sc">truth</span>.</p>

<p>
Thirdly, Sosa considers correspondence theories of truth according to
which &ldquo;the sentences on our lips or in our brains are true when
and only when they correspond appropriately with the facts or with
reality&rdquo; (2001: 642). Sosa suggests (2001: 646) that the success
of such correspondence theories will depend upon the development of a
satisfactory theory of reference, which is likely to take reference to
consist in the obtaining of certain causal relations (see, e.g., Field
1972). He also notes that despite a great deal of work in this area,
we seem to lack such a theory of reference, which calls the prospects
of such correspondence theories into question.</p>

<p>
It is worthwhile to note that the correspondence theories which Sosa
has in mind here would seem to be theories of the nature of the
property <em>truth</em>, rather than theories of the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>.
The aim of such theories is to articulate the
conditions under which a sentence is true, which can be naturally
regarded as the conditions that must be met for a sentence to possess
<em>truth</em>. By contrast, the correspondence theories at issue
aren&rsquo;t meant to be theories of how we ordinarily think about
truth, which indicates that they aren&rsquo;t meant to shed light on
our concept <span class="sc">truth</span>. For this reason, such
correspondence theories aren&rsquo;t obviously competitors with
Sosa&rsquo;s conceptual primitivism, given that one can consistently
defend rather different theories of <span class="sc">truth</span> and
<em>truth</em> (on this point, see, e.g., Alston 2002, as well as
 <a href="#PriDef">&sect;3.7</a>.
 For further critical discussion of Sosa&rsquo;s views about truth and
its role in epistemology, see McGrath &amp; Fantl 2013).</p>

<h3 id="ThiDis">3.3 Thick disquotationalism</h3>

<p>
Colin McGinn (2000) has put forward a primitivist account of truth
that he calls <em>thick disquotationalism</em>. Thick
disquotationalism is primitivist at both the conceptual and the
metaphysical levels (though admittedly, the concept-property
distinction proves to be slippery when it surfaces in McGinn&rsquo;s
discussion). The signature theses of thick disquotationalism include
(2000: 104&ndash;105):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(TD<sub>1</sub>)</dt>
<dd><span class="sc">truth</span> is primitive in that it cannot be
decomposed into simpler concepts;</dd>
<dt>(TD<sub>2</sub>)</dt>
<dd><em>Truth</em> is primitive in the sense that it lacks an
&ldquo;underlying empirical nature;&rdquo; yet</dd>
<dt>(TD<sub>3</sub>)</dt>
<dd>Both <span class="sc">truth</span> and <em>truth</em> are
non-circularly definable.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(TD<sub>3</sub>) might seem to be inconsistent with both
(TD<sub>1</sub>) and (TD<sub>2</sub>), but McGinn argues to the
contrary. McGinn&rsquo;s arguments for the non-circular definability
of <span class="sc">truth</span> and <em>truth</em> appeal to what he
calls the &lsquo;disquotation principle&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Disquotation principle&rsquo; is actually a misnomer for the
principle that McGinn has in mind here (he acknowledges this on 2000:
88 but persists in using this name for the principle). As Quine (1970
[1986: 12]) famously explains, disquotation is meant to be a procedure
that applies to the quotation names of <em>sentences</em> such as:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>&lsquo;Morocco is north of Liberia&rsquo;.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
However, McGinn&rsquo;s favored truth-bearers are propositions, rather
than sentences. As a result, the principle on which he draws is in
fact Paul Horwich&rsquo;s Equivalence Schema (for further discussion
of Horwich&rsquo;s views, see
 <a href="#PriDefTheTru">&sect;4.2</a>
 and the entry on
 <a href="../truth-deflationary/">deflationism about truth</a>).
 The Equivalence Schema has it that:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="exES">
<dt>(ES)</dt>
<dd>The proposition that <em>p</em> is true iff <em>p</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
McGinn&rsquo;s argument for the non-circular definability of
<em>truth</em> turns on the claim that <em>truth</em> can be defined
as the one and only <em>self-effacing</em> property (2000: 104). To
say that <em>truth</em> is self-effacing is to say that we can state
<em>truth</em>&rsquo;s instantiation conditions without referring to
<em>truth</em> itself.</p>

<p>
McGinn takes
 <a href="#exES">(ES)</a>
 to show us that <em>truth</em> is self-effacing. Consider an instance
of (ES) such as:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>The proposition that Zambia is north of Chad is true iff Zambia is
north of Chad.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
McGinn would suggest that (3) tells us which condition is both
necessary and sufficient for the proposition that Zambia is north of
Chad to possess <em>truth</em>. This condition is just that Zambia is
north of Chad. Notably, when we describe this condition, we
don&rsquo;t need to use &lsquo;true&rsquo;, &lsquo;truth&rsquo;, or
any other expression that could be reasonably taken to denote or
express <em>truth</em>. In this way, it seems that we are able to say
what it takes for a given proposition to possess <em>truth</em>
without explicitly or implicitly mentioning <em>truth</em>.
McGinn&rsquo;s contention is that <em>truth</em> is the only property
that behaves in this way. In light of this contention, he puts forward
the following definition of <em>truth</em> (2000:
 104):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex4">
<dt>(4)</dt>
<dd>The proposition that <em>p</em> is true iff the proposition that
<em>p</em> has the self-effacing property.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
McGinn suggests that defining <em>truth</em> as the one and only
self-effacing property is compatible with the view that <em>truth</em>
is primitive in that it lacks an underlying empirical nature. In this
way, McGinn takes <em>truth</em>&rsquo;s primitiveness to be
compatible with its non-circular definability. For discussion of a
number of apparent counterexamples to McGinn&rsquo;s contention that
<em>truth</em> is the only self-effacing property, see Wrenn
(2004).</p>

<p>
Turning to McGinn&rsquo;s argument for the non-circular definability
of <span class="sc">truth</span>, the details are much the same.
McGinn&rsquo;s contention here (2000: 105&ndash;106) is that <span class="sc">truth</span>
is non-circularly definable insofar as its
application conditions can be stated without using another concept
<em>C</em> that is extensionally or intensionally identical to <span class="sc">truth</span>.
This fact is again meant to be demonstrated
by
 <a href="#exES">(ES)</a>.
 McGinn suggests that it is suitable to read (ES) as telling us that
<span class="sc">truth</span> applies to a proposition <em>p</em> iff
p. This means that from (ES), we learn, for instance, that <span class="sc">truth</span>
applies to the proposition that Zambia is
north of Chad iff Zambia is north of Chad. In articulating the
right-hand side of this biconditional, we seem to have used neither
<span class="sc">truth</span> nor any concept that is extensionally or
intensionally identical to <span class="sc">truth</span>.</p>

<p>
Taking <span class="sc">truth</span> to be defined by
 <a href="#exES">(ES)</a>
 in this way looks to be compatible with the view that it is not
possible to decompose <span class="sc">truth</span> into simpler
concepts. For this reason, McGinn takes <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s
primitiveness to also be compatible
with its non-circular definability.</p>

<p>
Wrenn (2004: &sect;VII) points to a significant question that can be
raised for McGinn&rsquo;s argument for the non-circular definability
of <span class="sc">truth</span>. The question is whether schemas such
as
 <a href="#exES">(ES)</a>
 can be properly regarded as <em>definitions</em>. If schemas
shouldn&rsquo;t be regarded as definitions, then McGinn&rsquo;s
argument for <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s non-circular
definability seems to be seriously flawed, which calls
(TD<sub>3</sub>) into question. Notably, though, this potential flaw
doesn&rsquo;t put pressure on McGinn&rsquo;s conceptual primitivism.
This is because it doesn&rsquo;t call into question the idea that
<span class="sc">truth</span> cannot be decomposed into simpler
concepts, i.e. (TD<sub>1</sub>). For further discussion of related
issues, see
 <a href="#PriDefTheTru">&sect;4.2</a>

<h3 id="TruMonNonIntPro">3.4 <em>Truth</em> as a monadic, non-intrinsic property</h3>

<p>
In the twenty-first century, primitivism has been endorsed, often
briefly, by an extensive range of philosophers. Here, we will focus on
the most detailed twenty-first century defenses of primitivism. These
come respectively from Trenton Merricks, Timothy Nulty, Douglas
Patterson, and Jamin Asay. (For additional endorsements, see Armstrong
2004: 17; Boghossian 2010: 562&ndash;3; Hinzen 2007: 10&ndash;11, 13;
Khatchadourian 2011: i&ndash;ii, 2&ndash;3; MacFarlane 2005: 305, 313,
321, 2014: 98, 100; McLeod 2016: x, 21, 31, 33&ndash;35, 52, 106, 175,
2018b: 133; Lowe 2007: 259; Rumfitt 2022: 299; Schaffer 2008: 309;
Simionato 2023; Wiggins 2022: 164&ndash;165, &sect;12, n. 14; and B.
Williams 2002: 63. See also Zalta 2014.)</p>

<p>
Merricks (2007: ch. 8) puts forward a notable variety of metaphysical
primitivism according to which <em>truth</em> is a monadic (i.e.
non-relational), non-intrinsic property that cannot be analyzed, at
least when it is exemplified by its primary bearers. He offers two
reasons for taking <em>truth</em> to be a monadic property. The first
is that <em>truth</em>, according to Merricks, cannot be a relation
between a <em>truth-bearer</em>, e.g., a proposition or a belief, and
some other entity or entities (note the parallel with Moore
1899&rsquo;s criticisms of Bradley). Merricks supports this claim by
developing a systematic case for the view that some truths lack
<em>truthmakers</em>, i.e. that some truth-bearers are true even
though they are not true in virtue of standing in a relation to a
certain entity or entities. A running example is <em>negative
existential</em> propositions, such as the proposition that hobbits do
not exist, which Merricks argues cannot be made true by any existing
entity or entities.</p>

<p>
While Merricks denies that <em>truth</em> is a relation, he
nevertheless argues (2007: &sect;V) that <em>truth</em> exists by
presenting two concerns for a deflationary view according to which it
fails to exist. Combining his denial that <em>truth</em> is a relation
with his affirmation of <em>truth</em>&rsquo;s existence, Merricks
concludes that <em>truth</em> must be a monadic property. An
interesting wrinkle is that while Merricks takes <em>truth</em> to be
monadic, he also insists that <em>truth</em> is non-intrinsic, given
that &ldquo;whether a proposition exemplifies [<em>truth</em>] is
often a matter of how things are around it&rdquo; (2007: 182). For
instance, Merricks would hold that even though <em>truth</em> is not
itself a relation, the truth of the proposition that apples are solid
is determined not just by the nature of that proposition but also by
the solidity of apples.</p>

<p>
Having concluded that <em>truth</em> is monadic, Merricks suggests
that if <em>truth</em> were analyzable, then it would have to be
analyzable in terms of monadic properties that are exemplified by all
and only the true truth-bearers. Yet he takes the latter hypothesis to
be highly dubious, pointing briefly to a characteristic remark by
Russell (e.g., 1912: 70) to the effect that the truth of a belief
cannot be plausibly taken to consist in intrinsic properties of the
belief such as its &ldquo;vividness&rdquo;. This leads Merricks to
infer that <em>truth</em> is not analyzable and is thus a primitive
property.</p>

<p>
While it is sharply formulated, Merricks&rsquo; argument for
metaphysical primitivism may proceed a bit too quickly. In particular,
it is worth noting that the remark by Russell which Merricks uses to
motivate metaphysical primitivism concerns beliefs&rsquo;
<em>intrinsic</em> properties, rather than their monadic properties.
Since Merricks takes some monadic properties to be non-intrinsic, an
appeal to this remark looks to be out of place in Merricks&rsquo;
argument.</p>

<p>
Merricks&rsquo; response to this concern might very well be
concessive, given that he maintains that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he monadicity of [<em>truth</em>] is the main point here. Its
primitivity is not essential to the other claims about truth made in
this chapter or, indeed, in this book. (2007: 183)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These remarks show that Merricks sees metaphysical primitivism, in
contrast to the view that <em>truth</em> is monadic, as a highly
negotiable aspect of his overall views on truth and truthmaking. (For
an additional response to Merricks on behalf of truth pluralism, see
Edwards 2018: ch. 9. See also Griffith 2015 and Rasmussen 2014:
&sect;1.4.4, ch. 6.)</p>

<h3 id="PriDisAle">3.5 Primitive disclosive alethism</h3>

<p>
Timothy Nulty has defended a variety of conceptual primitivism that he
calls <em>primitive disclosive alethism</em>. In defending primitive
disclosive alethism, Nulty offers three main reasons for taking <span class="sc">truth</span>
to be primitive which are based on ideas from
Davidson and
 <a href="../heidegger/">Martin Heidegger</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The first reason involves the Heideggerian idea that we don&rsquo;t
take true assertions to agree with things that they represent but
instead take true assertions to &lsquo;point to&rsquo; or
&lsquo;reveal&rsquo; particular parts of reality (see Heidegger 1927
[1962: 260&ndash;261]). Nulty (2006: 191, 2007: 13) endorses this
idea, proposing as well that the relation of pointing to/revealing
isn&rsquo;t analyzable in more fundamental terms. This is meant to
show that <span class="sc">truth</span> is not analyzable in more
fundamental terms.</p>

<p>
This argument doesn&rsquo;t clearly provide a reason for taking <span class="sc">truth</span>
to be primitive. The Heideggerian proposal at
issue here seems to involve analyzing <span class="sc">truth</span> in
terms of <span class="sc">pointing</span>/<span class="sc">revealing</span>.
If the latter concepts are more
fundamental than <span class="sc">truth</span>, then this Heideggerian
proposal actually militates against conceptual primitivism. A key
question to be investigated, then, is whether we should take <span class="sc">pointing</span>/<span class="sc">revealing</span>
to be
more or less fundamental than (or perhaps equifundamental with) <span class="sc">truth</span>.
This is a question that should presumably be
investigated using the methods of cognitive science; for a discussion
of related topics, see
 <a href="#EmpSigPriFalBelAtt">&sect;5</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Nulty&rsquo;s second reason (2006: 191, 2007: 14) for taking <span class="sc">truth</span>
to be primitive specifically concerns
purported definitions of <span class="sc">truth</span> in terms of
correspondence. These definitions, he suggests, will define <span class="sc">truth</span>
in terms of a correspondence between
truth-bearers and certain parts of reality&mdash;e.g.,
facts&mdash;that are meant to exist independently of human thought and
language. Nulty argues, however, that when we carve reality up into
parts such as facts, this carving is ineliminably informed by human
biology and human social practices, including our linguistic practices
(2006: 179&ndash;181, 2007: &sect;3). For this reason, he finds the
idea that there is a privileged carving of reality which is correct
independent of human thought and language to be suspect. On this
basis, Nulty contends that <span class="sc">truth</span> cannot be
defined in correspondence-theoretic terms.</p>

<p>
One limitation of this argument is that it seems possible to offer a
correspondence-theoretic definition of <span class="sc">truth</span>
which doesn&rsquo;t fit the mold that Nulty has detailed. One might
define <span class="sc">truth</span> in terms of a correspondence
between truth-bearers (e.g., beliefs) and facts, while also taking the
existence of facts to be somehow constrained by human thought and/or
language. In effect, this would amount to a combination of a
correspondence theory of <span class="sc">truth</span> with a variety
of anti-realism about facts. While such a combination would be
atypical, it nevertheless appears to be internally consistent. (For an
observation along the same lines, see &sect;9.2 of the entry on
 <a href="../truth-correspondence/#9.2">the correspondence theory of truth</a>.
 Note also that McTaggart held a nearby view, which combines a
correspondence theory of truth with a form of ontological idealism;
see &sect;5 of the entry on
 <a href="../mctaggart/#McTOntIde">John M.E. McTaggart</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Nulty&rsquo;s third reason for taking <span class="sc">truth</span> to
be primitive (2006: 191, 2007: 14) is that as Davidson and Heidegger
emphasized, for something to be a thinking subject, it must possess
<span class="sc">truth</span>. This means that one must possess <span class="sc">truth</span>
to possess any other concepts, which indicates
that <span class="sc">truth</span> is primitive.
 <a href="#EmpSigPriFalBelAtt">&sect;5</a>
 of this entry will discuss evidence from developmental and
comparative psychology that bears on this line of argument.</p>

<h3 id="ConTruCir">3.6 The conception of <span class="sc">truth</span> as circular</h3>

<p>
Douglas Patterson has laid out a distinctive take on the idea that
<span class="sc">truth</span> is a primitive concept, according to
which the <em>conception</em> of <span class="sc">truth</span> is
circular. As Patterson (2010: 13, 21) uses the term, the
<em>conception</em> of the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> is
the set of claims about truth that anyone who possesses <span class="sc">truth</span>
must be disposed to accept upon consideration.
Patterson calls claims of this sort <em>conceptually analytic</em> for
the concept <span class="sc">truth</span>.</p>

<p>
Patterson&rsquo;s conceptual primitivism has it that the conception of
<span class="sc">truth</span> is <em>circular</em>, in that upon
analysis, all of the claims that constitute <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s
conception turn out to involve <span class="sc">truth</span>.
Extending the metaphor in the passage from
Davidson quoted in
 <a href="#TruTarMea">&sect;3.1</a>,
 we can say that Patterson&rsquo;s core contention is that the
conception of <span class="sc">truth</span> does not reach deeper into
bedrock, insofar as its conception is shot through with instances of
<span class="sc">truth</span>.</p>

<p>
Patterson provides two main reasons for taking <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s
conception to be circular in this way.
(For a third reason that he presents very briefly, see 2010: 24.) The
first (2010: 21, 26) is the conjecture that when asked &lsquo;What is
truth?&rsquo;, ordinary speakers will not be disposed to offer
non-circular responses to this question. Patterson takes this to
indicate that the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> which ordinary
speakers possess has a circular conception.</p>

<p>
Upon reflection, it should be clear that Patterson is putting forward
an empirical conjecture here that should in turn be evaluated
empirically. To date, the only extant empirical data which bear
directly on Patterson&rsquo;s conjecture are the qualitative data that
were reported by Arne N&aelig;ss (1938a, b). Further work would be
needed to determine whether N&aelig;ss&rsquo; data confirm or
disconfirm Patterson&rsquo;s conjecture. (Other relevant data include
those of Barnard &amp; Ulatowski 2013, 2021; K&ouml;lbel 2008;
Mizumoto 2022, 2024; Reuter 2024; and Reuter &amp; Brun 2021.)</p>

<p>
Patterson&rsquo;s second motivation for his conceptual primitivism is
that every extant theory according to which <span class="sc">truth</span>
has a non-circular conception is highly
problematic (2010: &sect;2). Summarizing briefly, Patterson takes
<em>deflationary</em> theories of <span class="sc">truth</span> to be
unsatisfactory insofar as they invite either the <em>problem of
necessity</em> or the <em>problem of paradox</em> (2010:
14&ndash;16)<em>.</em> The problem of necessity is meant to have two
aspects: (i) that deflationary theories misidentify the set of claims
that are conceptually analytic for <span class="sc">truth</span> and
(ii) that deflationary theories implausibly entail that anyone who
possesses <span class="sc">truth</span> must know the meaning of every
English expression. The problem of paradox is meant to be that we can
derive logical falsehoods from deflationary theories of <span class="sc">truth</span>
given the familiar suite of semantic paradoxes
such as the
 <a href="../liar-paradox/">Liar paradox</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Patterson takes minimalist theories of <span class="sc">truth</span>
such as that of Horwich (1998) (which he regards as being distinct
from deflationary theories) to be unsatisfactory as they cannot
deliver a satisfying account of what it is for a sentence or an
utterance to &lsquo;express&rsquo; a proposition (Patterson 2010: 18).
He takes traditional <em>substantivist</em> theories of <span class="sc">truth</span>&mdash;e.g.,
correspondence, coherence, or
pragmatist theories&mdash;to be problematic because they either turn
out to be circular or to misidentify the intension, and in some cases
the extension, of <span class="sc">truth</span> (2010: 18&ndash;19).
Finally, Patterson takes pluralist theories of <span class="sc">truth</span>
to be inadequate as they either inherit the
problems with deflationary theories or misidentify <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s
intension (2010: 20&ndash;21).</p>

<p>
Patterson&rsquo;s criticisms here are all highly nuanced, and they
deserve extended consideration. An issue that should be flagged,
though, is one that dovetails with the apparent shortcoming in
Patterson&rsquo;s first motivation for conceptual primitivism. A claim
to the effect that <span class="sc">truth</span> (or any concept, for
that matter) has such-and-so intension or extension, or that a given
theory misidentifies <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s intension
or extension, would seem to be empirical in nature. Whether a claim of
either of these sorts is true or false hinges on what <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s
intension or extension actually is,
and that is presumably an empirical matter. Accordingly, while
armchair reflection on a conjecture of either of these sorts may lend
it some initial credibility, it must ultimately be evaluated in light
of empirical evidence regarding how ordinary thinkers (or ordinary
English speakers, or whoever the target population are) think about
truth.</p>

<h3 id="PriDef">3.7 Primitivist deflationism</h3>

<p>
Lastly, over an extensive body of work, Jamin Asay (2013a, b, c, 2014,
2018, 2021a, b) has developed the most thorough and nuanced defense of
primitivism to date. Primitivism is standardly viewed as a rival to
deflationism, which has been one of the most popular approaches to
truth (see, e.g., Burgess &amp; Burgess 2011: 87; K&uuml;nne 2003:
Figs. 1.2 and 1.3, 317; Lynch, Wyatt, Kim, and Kellen 2021:
506&ndash;507; and Wright 1998: 33). A core thesis of deflationary
theories of truth is that truth is <em>insubstantial</em> in that (i)
we can&rsquo;t say anything very interesting about its nature and (ii)
it lacks explanatory power (for further discussion, see
 <a href="#PriDefTheTru">&sect;4.2</a>
 of this entry, the entry on
 <a href="../truth-deflationary/">deflationism about truth</a>,
 as well as Edwards 2013, 2018: ch. 2; Eklund 2021; Scharp 2021:
&sect;10; Wyatt 2016, 2021, 2023a; and the references therein). With
the concept-property distinction in view
 (<a href="#ConProTer">&sect;1</a>),
 it is easy to see that there are at least two levels, so to speak, at
which one might be a deflationist: one might be a deflationist about
<span class="sc">truth</span>, or one might be a deflationist about
<em>truth</em> (or
 both).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
For his part, Asay argues that we should accept a version of
deflationism about <em>truth</em> while firmly rejecting deflationism
about <span class="sc">truth</span>, opting instead for primitivism
about <span class="sc">truth</span>. Asay, then, is a conceptual
primitivist and a metaphysical deflationist, so it is useful to call
his theory of truth <em>primitivist deflationism</em>. (For a
different case for combining deflationism with primitivism, see
Greimann 2000.)</p>

<p>
Primitivist deflationism consists of four core
 theses:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul class="hanging">

<li><em>Fundamentality:</em> <span class="sc">truth</span> is
<em>fundamental</em>&mdash;it cannot be analyzed in terms of more
fundamental concepts</li>

<li><em>Explanatory Indispensability:</em> <span class="sc">truth</span>
is <em>explanatorily
indispensable</em>&mdash;we must use <span class="sc">truth</span> to
explain certain phenomena</li>

<li><em>Omnipresence:</em> <span class="sc">truth</span> is a
structural component of every propositional thought</li>

<li><em>Insubstantiality:</em> The property <em>truth</em> is a
non-primitive, but nevertheless insubstantial, property.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With regard to Fundamentality, the initial idea is that we can think
of our concepts as being arranged in a <em>dependence structure</em>.
To possess a concept that is higher up in this structure, one must
possess one or more concepts that are lower down, though not vice
versa. To say that <span class="sc">truth</span> is fundamental, then,
is to say that <span class="sc">truth</span> resides at the ground
level of this structure&mdash;that there is no concept <em>C</em> such
that to possess <span class="sc">truth</span>, one must possess
<em>C</em> but not vice versa.</p>

<p>
Explanatory Indispensability sets up a link between Asay&rsquo;s views
and those of Davidson. Both Asay and Davidson reject deflationism
about <span class="sc">truth</span> insofar as they take <span class="sc">truth</span>
to have explanatory power. That is, they hold
that there are phenomena that we just can&rsquo;t explain without
using <span class="sc">truth</span>. One of these phenomena is
linguistic meaning. As explained in
 <a href="#TruTarMea">&sect;3.1</a>,
 Davidson maintained that a declarative sentence has a certain meaning
because it has certain truth-conditions. Asay concurs (2013c:
&sect;8.4), and infers that to explain the nature of linguistic
meaning, we cannot do without <span class="sc">truth</span>. We will
say more about the connections between primitivist and deflationary
theories in
 <a href="#PriDefTheTru">&sect;4.2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Omnipresence rests on a contrast between two kinds of components of
<em>propositional thoughts</em>, where a propositional thought is a
state of mind such as believing, regretting, or imagining that has
propositional content. According to Asay, some of the components of
propositional thoughts are <em>aboutness-determining</em>, in that
they (partially) determine what a propositional thought is
 about.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 By contrast, he takes other components of propositional thoughts to
be <em>structural</em>, in that they (partially) determine the
structure of a propositional thought without determining what it is
about. For example, we can regard the belief that stones are not
liquid as being composed of the concepts <span class="sc">stone</span><strong>,
</strong><span class="sc">liquid</span><strong>,</strong>
and <span class="sc">(propositional)
negation</span>. It is fair to say that
this belief is about stones and liquidity, which means that <span class="sc">stone</span>
and <span class="sc">liquid</span> are
aboutness-determining components of the belief. By contrast, it seems
that the belief isn&rsquo;t about negation. Rather, <span class="sc">negation</span>
looks to be a structural component of the
belief.</p>

<p>
Omnipresence is the claim that <span class="sc">truth</span> is
similar to <span class="sc">negation</span>, except that <span class="sc">truth</span>
is a structural component of <em>every</em>
propositional thought. Asay (2013a: &sect;3, 2013c: &sect;5.2, 2021a:
&sect;3.3) defends Omnipresence via the <em>omnipresence
argument</em>, which is meant to be a new-and-improved successor to
Frege&rsquo;s treadmill argument.</p>

<p>
Lastly, as a metaphysical deflationist, Asay maintains that while the
property <em>truth</em> isn&rsquo;t primitive, it is nevertheless a
merely insubstantial property. One of Asay&rsquo;s main concerns for
metaphysical primitivism is that it looks to entail that facts about
which truth-bearers are/aren&rsquo;t true are objectionably mysterious
(2013c: 75, 87&ndash;88, 2021a, 526). As we saw in
 <a href="#BerRusPriAboTru">&sect;2.3</a>,
 Russell also took this to be a serious problem with metaphysical
primitivism. Asay&rsquo;s central idea in connection with
<em>truth</em>&rsquo;s insubstantiality is that while <em>truth</em>
does exist, this property lacks the explanatory power that is enjoyed
by what David Lewis (1983) called &lsquo;sparse&rsquo; or
&lsquo;natural&rsquo; properties. In this respect, Asay&rsquo;s views
about <em>truth</em> are the polar opposite of his views about <span class="sc">truth</span><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>
Asay&rsquo;s primitivist deflationism is a novel and provocative
theory.
 <a href="#EmpSigPriFalBelAtt">&sect;5</a>
 will briefly examine its prospects in light of relevant empirical
findings on false belief attribution. For discussion of a range of
concerns that can be raised for the theory, see Collins (2015) and
Wyatt (2023b).</p>

<h2 id="ConOthTheTru">4. Connections to other theories of truth</h2>

<p>
There are a number of multifaceted connections between primitivist
truth theories and truth theories of other kinds. This section will
provide an overview of the ways in which primitivist theories are
related to identity theories, deflationary theories, and axiomatic
theories of truth.</p>

<h3 id="PriIdeTheTru">4.1 Primitivism and identity theories of truth</h3>

<p>
According to
 <a href="../truth-identity/#DefiPrelExpo">identity theories of truth</a>,
 a proposition <em>p</em> is true iff <em>p</em> is identical to a
fact. In the literature on identity theories, the following question
has loomed large: should an identity theorist be a primitivist about
the property <em>truth</em>? There is a fair amount of consensus that
the answer to this question is &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
It is standardly held that in the period in which Moore and Russell
took <em>truth</em> to be primitive, they also endorsed identity
theories of truth (see the entry on
 <a href="../truth-identity/#DefiPrelExpo">the identity theory of truth</a>
 and Cartwright 1987). In a similar fashion, Frege remarks near the
end of &lsquo;The thought&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Facts, facts, facts&rdquo; cries the scientist if he wants to
emphasize the necessity of a firm foundation for science. What is a
fact? A fact is a thought that is true. (1918&ndash;1919 [1956,
307])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This remark suggests that in addition to holding that <span class="sc">truth</span>
is primitive, Frege may have endorsed an
identity theory of truth. Given the concept-property distinction
 (<a href="#ConProTer">&sect;1</a>),
 this view appears to at least be internally consistent. (See also
Candlish 1999: n. 22 on Meinong&rsquo;s views about truth. For a
critical discussion of the view that Frege and the early Moore and
Russell endorsed identity theories of truth, see Asay 2013c:
&sect;3.4.2.)</p>

<p>
Jennifer Hornsby, a leading contemporary advocate of an identity
theory of truth, claims in her highly influential paper on the topic
that her identity theory of truth &ldquo;acknowledges truth&rsquo;s
indefinability&rdquo; (1997: n. 5). Julian Dodd, another leading
identity theorist, emphasizes likewise that what he calls
&lsquo;modest&rsquo; identity theories are compatible with &ldquo;the
view that truth cannot be defined&rdquo; (2000: 123). Additionally,
Colin Johnston (2013: &sect;2.3, &sect;5.2, nn. 2, 4) has argued that
if an identity theory of truth is paired with a dual relation (rather
than a multiple relation) theory of judgment, then if a
judgment&rsquo;s truth condition obtains/doesn&rsquo;t obtain, the
fact that it obtains/doesn&rsquo;t obtain is &ldquo;brute&rdquo;. (See
also Engel 2001: 446&rsquo;s criticism of what he calls an
&ldquo;identity theory of facts&rdquo;, one version of which entails
that <em>truth</em> is primitive, as well as Candlish &amp;
Damnjanovic 2018: 277. Working in the opposite direction, Nulty 2006:
184&ndash;185, 2007: &sect;5 argues that his primitive disclosive
alethism is importantly distinct from identity theories of truth.)</p>

<p>
More recently, Richard Gaskin (2021: chs. 6&ndash;7) has defended an
identity theory of truth which he takes to motivate the view that
<em>truth</em> is an undefinable property. Gaskin takes the bearers of
truth to be <em>Russellian propositions</em>, which are meant to be
composed of particulars such as Socrates and properties such as
<em>being wise</em> (2021: 89, 101). He asks us (2021: &sect;30) to
consider a correspondence theory of truth which takes truth to consist
in correspondence between Russellian propositions and obtaining states
of affairs that are numerically distinct from those propositions.</p>

<p>
Gaskin&rsquo;s concern for such a theory is founded in the thought
that there is no &ldquo;linguistic distance&rdquo; between the ways in
which we talk about propositions and the ways in which we talk about
states of affairs (2021: 179). He notes that we use that-clauses such
as &lsquo;that Socrates is wise&rsquo; to pick out both propositions
and states of affairs. Moving a step further, he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[l]et us ask: why is the proposition <em>that Socrates is wise</em>
true? If I reply by saying that it is true because it corresponds to
an obtaining state of affairs, namely <em>that Socrates is wise</em>,
I seem to have explained nothing but merely repeated the explanandum.
(2021: 179)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given that he takes sentences of the form &lsquo;Proposition
<em>p</em> is true&rsquo; and &lsquo;Proposition <em>p</em>
corresponds to an obtaining state of affairs&rsquo; to have the same
content, Gaskin concludes that we cannot <em>explain</em> why true
propositions are true by mentioning that they correspond to obtaining
states of affairs.</p>

<p>
Instead, Gaskin&rsquo;s proposal is that true propositions are
identical to obtaining states of affairs and false propositions are
identical to non-obtaining states of affairs. This identity theory is
meant to better reflect the lack of linguistic distance between our
ways of talking about propositions and states of affairs. Moreover,
Gaskin argues, this theory entails that <em>truth</em> is undefinable.
According to the theory, the proposition <em>p</em> is true iff it is
identical to an obtaining state of affairs/fact. Remarking on this
general statement, Gaskin urges that &ldquo;it is hard to see that
much of substance has thereby been said about truth&rdquo; (2021:
180). That is, Gaskin takes this general statement about truth to fall
short of a definition of <em>truth</em>, insofar as it fails to
illuminate <em>truth</em>&rsquo;s underlying nature. His reason
appears to again be that the left- and right-hand sides of this
biconditional have the same content (see 2021: 181, 183).</p>

<p>
Gaskin also argues that his identity theory takes <em>truth</em> to be
an intrinsic property, insofar as it entails that the truth of an
atomic proposition does not consist in that proposition&rsquo;s
standing in a relation to some distinct entity <em>x</em> (2021: 182;
see also &sect;5.6 of his entry on
 <a href="../truth-identity/#TrutIntr">the identity theory of truth</a>).
 In this respect, Gaskin&rsquo;s variety of metaphysical primitivism
is notably distinct from the variety that is defended by Merricks
 (<a href="#TruMonNonIntPro">&sect;3.4</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="PriDefTheTru">4.2 Primitivism and deflationary theories of truth</h3>

<p>
A more challenging comparison is that between primitivist and
deflationary theories of truth. Deflationists have observed that the
traditional project of attempting to uncover the essence of the
property <em>truth</em> has yielded little in the way of consensus.
They take this to be a strong motivation for abandoning this
traditional project and instead regarding <em>truth</em> as being at
most a merely insubstantial property. Given this attitude towards
<em>truth</em>, deflationists aim instead to identify the signature
roles that the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> and truth terms
play in our cognition and languages.</p>

<p>
The comparison between primitivist and deflationary theories is
challenging because at first blush, these look like very similar ways
of thinking about truth. Primitivists and deflationists both stand in
opposition to the traditional project of trying to analyze the nature
of truth. As such, both primitivist and deflationary theories seem to
entail, in effect, that there isn&rsquo;t much to say about truth (cp.
McGrath 2005: 308). Paul Horwich, a leading deflationist about truth,
has even described &lsquo;true&rsquo; as a primitive term (Horwich
2010: 80). This raises the question of whether we should think of
deflationary and primitivist accounts of <span class="sc">truth</span>,
<em>truth</em>, and truth terms as really
converging on the same set of core ideas.</p>

<p>
While primitivist and deflationary theories do exhibit a certain
degree of convergence, the extent of this convergence shouldn&rsquo;t
be overstated. Consider truth terms first, focusing in particular on
Horwich&rsquo;s minimalist account of &lsquo;true&rsquo;. In the
passage mentioned above, one of Horwich&rsquo;s central claims is that
&lsquo;true&rsquo; cannot be <em>explicitly</em> defined, e.g., using
a definition of the following form (see also Horwich 1998:
10&ndash;11, 20, 121, 128, &sect;&sect;5, 7, 38, 2010: 6, 15,
22&ndash;27, 35, n. 1, 38&ndash;40, 42, 82&ndash;83, 86, 96, 104):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(Tr)</dt>
<dd>For all <em>x</em>: <em>x</em> is true iff
&hellip;<em>x</em>&hellip;</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In this respect, Horwich&rsquo;s views regarding truth terms converge
with a variety of primitivism that was not covered in
 <a href="#EarPriThe">&sect;2&ndash;3</a>,
 as it is not defended by the main proponents of primitivist theories
of truth. This variety of primitivism concerns truth terms, rather
than the concept <span class="sc">truth</span> or the property
<em>truth</em>. According to this view, which we can call <em>term
primitivism</em>, the word &lsquo;true&rsquo; (and perhaps all other
truth terms) is not analyzable in terms of more fundamental linguistic
expressions.</p>

<p>
However, there is another key respect in which minimalism and term
primitivism diverge. Horwich&rsquo;s view is that when we explain what
&lsquo;true&rsquo; means, the best strategy is to identify the fact
about how &lsquo;true&rsquo; is used which explains why it means what
it does. According to Horwich, this fact is that the community of
speakers who use &lsquo;true&rsquo; are disposed to accept every
instance of the Equivalence Schema in the absence of supporting
 evidence:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(ES)</dt>
<dd>The proposition that <em>p</em> is true iff <em>p</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This leads Horwich to conclude that while &lsquo;true&rsquo; cannot be
explicitly defined, it can be <em>implicitly</em>
defined&mdash;namely, by the Equivalence Schema (Horwich 1998:
 121).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It is here that minimalism parts company with term primitivism.
 <a href="#exES">(ES)</a>
 contains the term &lsquo;proposition&rsquo;, and the minimalist takes
(ES) to implicitly define &lsquo;true&rsquo;. This means that if the
minimalist held that the meaning of &lsquo;true&rsquo; is more
fundamental than that of &lsquo;proposition&rsquo;, then their
implicit definition of &lsquo;true&rsquo; would be viciously circular.
Being cognizant of this, Horwich argues that the meaning of
&lsquo;proposition&rsquo; is more fundamental than that of
&lsquo;true&rsquo; (Horwich 1998: 103, &sect;&sect;22, 32, Postscript
&sect;3; see also 2010: 50&ndash;53).</p>

<p>
Putting the pieces together, this means that while the minimalist
denies that &lsquo;true&rsquo; is explicitly definable, they
nevertheless accept that &lsquo;true&rsquo; is implicitly definable in
terms of a more fundamental expression&mdash;namely,
&lsquo;proposition&rsquo;. Insofar as implicitly defining a term is
one (though certainly not the only) way of analyzing it, the
minimalist is committed to holding that &lsquo;true&rsquo; is
analyzable in terms of a more fundamental linguistic expression. In
this respect, minimalism and term primitivism are fundamentally at
odds. (For a similar observation, see Horwich 1998: 138&ndash;139. See
Fischer &amp; Zicchetti 2023: 1323 and Nicolai 2021 for further
discussion of deflationism and primitivism about truth terms.)</p>

<p>
Primitivist and deflationary theories also differ in important ways at
both the conceptual and metaphysical levels. Regarding the concept
<span class="sc">truth</span>, these two sorts of theory converge
insofar as they entail that <span class="sc">truth</span> cannot be
analyzed in terms of concepts like <span class="sc">correspondence</span>,
<span class="sc">coherence</span>,
or <span class="sc">verifiability</span>. As discussed in
 <a href="#PriDef">&sect;3.7</a>,
 however, they diverge when it comes to <span class="sc">truth</span>&rsquo;s
explanatory power. Primitivists (most
notably Davidson and Asay) argue that truth has explanatory power,
e.g., in theories of the nature of linguistic meaning or the nature of
assertion, whereas deflationists deny that it has such explanatory
power (this point is echoed by Candlish &amp; Damnjanovic 2007:
&sect;3.8; cf. Fisher 2014: 282).</p>

<p>
Turning to <em>truth</em>, deflationists, like primitivists,
characteristically hold that <em>truth</em> cannot be defined or
analyzed in terms of more fundamental properties or relations (see,
e.g., Horwich 1998: 143, 2010: ch. 1, 13, 15&ndash;16, 38, 2013: 57,
59; see also Fisher 2014: 283). However, there are at least three
significant respects in which deflationary and primitivist theories of
<em>truth</em> diverge.</p>

<p>
The first is that certain deflationists&mdash;including Ayer (1946),
Brandom (2005), Grover (1992), Quine (1948, 1970, 1987), Ramsey
(1927), and Strawson (1949, 1950)&mdash;have denied or else would deny
that <em>truth</em> exists. These deflationists&mdash;we might call
them <em>pure deflationists</em>, since they advocate an eliminative
metaphysics of truth&mdash;must clearly reject primitivism about
<em>truth</em>. This is because primitivism about <em>truth</em>
entails that <em>truth</em> does exist. (Cp. Strollo 2023: 925.
Merricks 2007: ch. 8, &sect;V emphasizes this difference when arguing
that his primitivism is preferable to deflationism. On the
relationship between Davidson&rsquo;s conceptual primitivism and pure
deflationism, see Salis 2019).</p>

<p>
A second detail to mention is that deflationists who do take
<em>truth</em> to exist&mdash;we can call them <em>moderate
deflationists</em>&mdash;characteristically hold that <em>truth</em>
lacks explanatory power (see, e.g., Dodd 2000: 133, 149&ndash;155;
Horwich 1998: Postscript &sect;7; and M. Williams 2002: &sect;5; for
further discussion, see Wyatt 2016: &sect;III.3). It is open to a
primitivist about <em>truth</em> to deny this claim, much as Davidson
and Asay do with regard to the concept <span class="sc">truth</span><strong>.</strong>
This means that when it
comes to the choice between primitivism and deflationism about
<em>truth</em>, a central consideration is again whether
<em>truth</em> has or lacks explanatory power (cp. Edwards 2013: 9;
Fisher 2014: 286&ndash;287; Strollo 2023: 925&ndash;926, &sect;7; and
Wyatt 2016: 380&ndash;381).</p>

<p>
A third key difference is that primitivists and moderate deflationists
offer different <em>reasons</em> for thinking that <em>truth</em>
cannot be defined or analyzed in terms of more fundamental properties
or relations (see Dodd 2000: ch. 5, n. 14, and cp. Fisher 2014:
285&ndash;286). The distinctive deflationary reason, due to Horwich
(1998: 2&ndash;5), is that we can apparently explain the cognitive and
linguistic behavior of <span class="sc">truth</span> and
&lsquo;true&rsquo; by supposing that they are mere <em>expressive
devices</em>. The specific deflationary claims here are that:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>to possess <span class="sc">truth</span>/understand the meaning of
&lsquo;true&rsquo;, one must be disposed to accept every instance of
 <a href="#exES">(ES)</a>
 in the absence of supporting evidence and</li>

<li>the primary function of <span class="sc">truth</span> and
&lsquo;true&rsquo; is to enable us to have thoughts and make
utterances that we couldn&rsquo;t otherwise have or make, due to our
cognitive and linguistic limitations.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If these claims are correct, Horwich argues (1998: 2), then</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[&ldquo;true&rdquo;] is not used to attribute to certain entities
(i.e. statements, beliefs, etc.) an ordinary sort of property&mdash;a
characteristic whose underlying nature will account for its relations
to other ingredients of reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By contrast, the motivations for primitivist theories of
<em>truth</em> are quite different. A review of
 <a href="#GEMooPriAboTru">&sect;2.2</a>,
 <a href="#BerRusPriAboTru">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#ThiDis">&sect;3.3</a>,
 and
 <a href="#TruMonNonIntPro">&sect;3.4</a>
 of this entry will make this very apparent. (For more on the
differences between primitivist and deflationary theories, see McGrath
1997: 84&ndash;85, 2000 [2013: 40] and Sosa 1993a: &sect;D, 2001:
&sect;5.)</p>

<h3 id="PriAxiTheTru">4.3 Primitivism and axiomatic theories of truth</h3>

<p>
A final connection to explore is that between primitivist and
 <a href="../truth-axiomatic/">axiomatic theories of truth</a>.
 (For discussion of the motivations for and details of various
axiomatic theories of truth, see Fujimoto &amp; Halbach 2018; Halbach
2011; and Horsten 2011.) Axiomatic theories of truth concern truth
predicates that are meant to apply to sentences of particular formal
languages. Unlike traditional theories of truth such as
correspondence, coherence, or pragmatic theories, axiomatic theories
aren&rsquo;t founded on the presupposition that these truth predicates
are definable. Advocates of axiomatic theories wish to avoid this
presupposition in light of Tarski&rsquo;s theorem concerning the
undefinability of truth for certain formal languages
 (<a href="#TruTarMea">&sect;3.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Rather than attempting to define the truth predicates with which they
are concerned, advocates of axiomatic theories propose axioms that
govern the behavior of these predicates. For instance, suppose that we
are interested in offering a theory of truth for an object language
<em>L</em> which does not contain any semantic vocabulary. Using
corner quotes as a naming device, a particularly straightforward axiom
for a truth predicate <em>T</em> that applies only to
<em>L</em>&shy;-sentences would be (for discussion of axiomatic
theories of truth which follow along these basic lines, see Fujimoto
&amp; Halbach 2018: &sect;27.4.1; Halbach 2011: ch. 7; and Horsten
2011: ch. 4):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(Dis)</dt>
<dd>For all <em>L</em>-sentences \(\phi\):
\(T(\ulcorner\phi\urcorner)\) iff \(\phi\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In this way, axiomatic theories treat their target truth predicates as
primitive predicates. However, it is also important to note that
endorsing a particular axiomatic theory of truth doesn&rsquo;t commit
one to holding that the truth predicate that it concerns is
<em>undefinable</em>. Kentaro Fujimoto and Volker Halbach (2018: 719)
bring this point out particularly well (see also Halbach 2011:
3&ndash;4, 7&ndash;8):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Axiomatic approaches to truth, knowledge, or other notions do not rule
out the possibility of a definition for the notion in question: a
notion that is taken as primitive can turn out to be definable after
all. On an axiomatic approach, one just does not presuppose that the
notion is definable. Once it has been set out what is expected from
the notion, one can investigate whether a notion satisfying these
conditions is definable or eliminable in some sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This fact about axiomatic theories of truth sheds some light on the
sense in which they are primitivist theories of truth. Here, it is
useful to recall Brons&rsquo; contention that Wang Chong was a <em lang="la">de
facto</em> primitivist
 (<a href="#WanChoDeFacPri">&sect;2.1</a>).
 The idea is that although Wang never explicitly claims that the
concept <span class="sc">truth</span> is primitive, this concept
nevertheless operates as an undefined concept within his body of
thought. If <span class="sc">truth</span> so operates, one can endorse
all of Wang&rsquo;s views without committing oneself to the
definability of <span class="sc">truth</span>. However, that Wang is a
<em lang="la">de facto</em> primitivist doesn&rsquo;t entail that
anyone who endorses Wang&rsquo;s views is committed to the
undefinability of <span class="sc">truth</span>.</p>

<p>
The motivations for and details of axiomatic theories of truth are of
course very different from Wang&rsquo;s motivations and the details of
his writings. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that axiomatic theories
of truth are <em lang="la">de facto</em> primitivist theories. In an
axiomatic theory of truth, the truth predicates that the theory
axiomatizes operate as primitive predicates, but the theory
doesn&rsquo;t entail that these predicates are undefinable.
Accordingly, as Fujimoto and Halbach underscore, someone who endorses
an axiomatic theory isn&rsquo;t committed to the definability of the
truth predicates that the theory axiomatizes, nor are they are
committed to these predicates&rsquo; undefinability.</p>

<h2 id="EmpSigPriFalBelAtt">5. Empirical significance: primitivism and false belief attribution</h2>

<p>
A final issue to consider is the empirical significance of primitivist
theories of truth. Conceptual primitivism is particularly relevant
here, as it may find support from the extensive body of research on
<em>false-belief tasks</em>. (For further discussion, see Nulty 2008
and Ulatowski &amp; Wyatt 2023. On this and other relevant sources of
empirical evidence concerning truth, see Asay 2021b: S627&ndash;S628,
&sect;5, 2024, 2025; Brons 2016: &sect;1; Burge 2018: 425&ndash;427;
Hinzen 2013; Ulatowski 2017; von Heiseler 2020; Wyatt 2018; and Wyatt
&amp; Ulatowski 2024.) False-belief tasks are employed by
psychologists to study <em>theory of mind</em>, which is our cognitive
capacity to attribute mental states in attempting to make sense of the
behavior of agents (cp. Spaulding 2020: 1). In particular, a large
number of psychologists have used false-belief tasks to determine when
humans, as well as other primates such as great apes, attribute false
beliefs (see Ulatowski &amp; Wyatt 2023). In their landmark study,
Heinz Wimmer and Josef Perner describe a familiar type of false-belief
task as follows (1983: 106):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In order to test subjects&rsquo; comprehension of the other
person&rsquo;s wrong belief, stories like the following were
constructed: A story character, Maxi, puts chocolate into a cupboard
<em>x</em>. In his absence his mother displaces the chocolate from
<em>x</em> into cupboard <em>y</em>. Subjects have to indicate the box
where Maxi will look for the chocolate when he returns. Only when they
are able to represent Maxi&rsquo;s wrong belief (&lsquo;Chocolate is
in <em>x</em>&rsquo;) apart from what they themselves know to be the
case (&lsquo;Chocolate is in <em>y</em>&rsquo;) will they be able to
point correctly to box <em>x</em>. This procedure tests whether
subjects have an explicit and definite representation of the
other&rsquo;s wrong belief. Yet, there is neither a problem in framing
the test question by using mental verbs (e.g., &lsquo;What does Maxi
<em>believe</em>?&rsquo;) nor are subjects required to verbalize their
knowledge about other&rsquo;s beliefs since a mere pointing gesture
suffices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The body of evidence from the false-belief task literature seems to
bear directly on at least some varieties of conceptual primitivism.
Consider, for instance, Asay&rsquo;s Fundamentality thesis
 (<a href="#PriDef">&sect;3.7</a>).
 <span class="sc">truth</span> is a fundamental concept in
Asay&rsquo;s sense iff <span class="sc">truth</span> is either innate
or among the initial set of concepts that we acquire in the course of
cognitive development. Asay (2020: 106) puts this point crisply when
he remarks that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
truth is among our most basic and fundamental concepts, a concept
without which, as Davidson aptly claims, &ldquo;we would have no
concepts at all&rdquo; (1996 [2005: 20]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, if the body of evidence on false-belief tasks strongly supports
either of the hypotheses at issue here, then it supports the
Fundamentality thesis in turn and to that extent, supports conceptual
primitivism.</p>

<p>
Our current data should be at least somewhat encouraging to advocates
of Fundamentality. Baillargeon, Buttelmann, and Southgate (2018: 112)
point out that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]here are now over 30 published reports, spanning 11 different
methods, providing convergent evidence for false-belief understanding
in children ages 6&ndash;36 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If these studies are on the right track, then it looks as though very
young children are able to attribute false beliefs. Since they can
attribute false beliefs, it would seem that these children must
possess the concept <span class="sc">falsity</span>. Moreover, it is
highly probable that if they possess <span class="sc">falsity</span>,
then they also possess <span class="sc">truth</span>. So absent
compelling counterevidence that children acquire <span class="sc">truth</span>
in virtue of possessing more fundamental
concepts, it can be reasonably inferred that the body of false-belief
task evidence supports Fundamentality.</p>

<p>
This line of argument seems promising, though properly evaluating it
will require attention to a number of issues. One is whether we should
follow researchers such as Baillargeon, Buttelmann, and Southgate in
offering a <em>mentalistic</em> interpretation of the false-belief
task data, according to which they indicate that young children are
able to attribute mental states like belief. Tyler Burge (2018) has
recently proposed an alternative, non-mentalistic interpretation of
the data, and the jury is out on which of these (and a number of
other) interpretations is the best (for criticism of Burge&rsquo;s
interpretation, see Carruthers 2020 and Jacob 2020).</p>

<p>
Another relevant issue is whether, as Peter Carruthers (2020: &sect;4)
has argued, infants can represent beliefs while lacking an
<em>explicit</em>&mdash;detachable, symbolically
represented&mdash;concept <span class="sc">truth</span> (as well as,
presumably, an explicit concept <span class="sc">falsity</span>).
Carruthers&rsquo; proposal suggests that passing some false-belief
tasks, e.g., the active helping task used by Buttelmann, Carpenter,
and Tomasello (2009), may require possession of <span class="sc">truth</span>,
whereas passing others, e.g., the
change-of-location task of Wimmer and Perner (1983), may not.
Accordingly, it may be that only some of the false-belief task data
lend support to Fundamentality.</p>
