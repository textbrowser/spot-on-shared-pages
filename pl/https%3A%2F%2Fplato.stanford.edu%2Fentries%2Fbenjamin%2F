<h1>Walter Benjamin</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jan 18, 2011; substantive revision Tue Dec 23, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s importance as a philosopher and critical
theorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influence
and the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as
a literary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis of
Benjamin&rsquo;s writings has, over the last 50 years, been
increasingly acknowledged. These writings were a decisive influence
upon Theodor W. Adorno&rsquo;s conception of philosophy&rsquo;s
actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931) and on
&ldquo;Frankfurt School&rdquo; Critical Theory&rsquo;s broader attempt
to develop a politically oriented, materialist aesthetic theory.</p>

<p>
The delayed appearance of Benjamin&rsquo;s collected writings has
determined and sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. A
limited-edition hectograph (&lsquo;In Memory of Walter
Benjamin&rsquo;), which contained his theses &lsquo;On the Concept of
History&rsquo;, was first published &ndash; two years after
Benjamin&rsquo;s death &ndash; by the Institute for Social Research in
1942, but a two-volume selection of his writings was only published in
German in 1955, with a full edition not appearing until
1972&ndash;1989, and a 21-volume critical edition, in production since
2008, scheduled to be completed in 2027; English anthologies first
appeared in 1968 and 1978, and the four-volume Selected Writings
between 1996 and 2003.</p>

<p>
These delays were in part the result of disputes &ndash; primarily
between Hannah Arendt, and Theodor Adorno and Gershom Scholem &ndash;
over the ownership of Benjamin&rsquo;s literary estate and legacy,
controversies that resurfaced in the late 1960s and again in the early
2020s, and which continue to shape his reception and interpretation.
The two-volume collection of Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>Schriften</em>
(edited by Adorno and published in 1955) included examples of his
philosophical, historical and city writings. The subsequent selection
of essays for the first (shorter) English collection,
<em>Illuminations</em> (edited by Arendt in 1968), prioritized
Benjamin&rsquo;s literary criticism (with the exception of the theses
&lsquo;On the Concept of History&rsquo;), reflecting Arendt&rsquo;s
presentation of him, in her introduction to the collection, as a
&ldquo;metaphorical&rdquo; or &ldquo;poetical&rdquo; thinker, who like
a &ldquo;pearl diver&rdquo; sought to bring back &ldquo;thought
fragments&rdquo; from the depths of the past (Arendt 1968,
41&ndash;2).</p>

<p>
This contested reception of Benjamin&rsquo;s works partly reflected
and partly produced a sense of Benjamin&rsquo;s thought as
inconsistent, thereby establishing the task of academic scholarship
after his death: on the one hand, &ldquo;any attempt to establish a
unity from a series of texts as clearly diverse as Benjamin&rsquo;s
will always be thwarted&rdquo; (Benjamin, A. 1986, 30) so that
&ldquo;even his best readers sometime treat his corpus of writing as a
vast array of brilliant and idiosyncratic insights with hardly more to
unify them than the sense that they all bear the stamp of
Benjamin&rsquo;s unique and unclassifiable genius&rdquo; (Friedlander
2012, 2); on the other hand, Scholem and Adorno sought for an
underlying coherence to Benjamin&rsquo;s thought, either in Jewish
mysticism or European philosophy, that continues to animate some of
the most important interpretations of his work. Kohlenbach (2002,
x-xi), for example, has argued that &ldquo;in contrast to (secular)
theory and philosophy&rdquo; it is &ldquo;Benjamin&rsquo;s
religiosity&rdquo; that is essential not only to his direct engagement
with religious ideas but also &ldquo;to both the apparently academic
and the most &lsquo;materialist&rsquo; parts of Benjamin&rsquo;s
work&rdquo;, whereas Friedlander (2012, 2) has argued for &ldquo;the
philosophical armature that &hellip;holds his writings together&rsquo;
and &lsquo;gather[s]&hellip; into a unity of thinking the disparate
moments of Benjamin&rsquo;s writings&rdquo;. One way to reconcile
these claims is to understand Benjamin&rsquo;s approach as a
&ldquo;philosophizing beyond philosophy&rdquo; (Caygill 1998, 120),
which, driven by a transdisciplinary and historical impulse (Osborne
2011), draws upon ostensibly non-philosophical thought in order to
complete its philosophical task.</p>

<p>
Originally received in the context of literary theory and aesthetics,
only in the last decades of the 20th century did the philosophical
depth and cultural breadth of Benjamin&rsquo;s thought begin to be
fully appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary
literature that it has produced, his work remains a continuing source
of productivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his
work has contributed to the philosophical revival of Early German
Romanticism. His philosophy of language has played a seminal role in
translation theory. His essay on &lsquo;The Work of Art in the Age of
Its Technological Reproducibility&rsquo; remains a major theoretical
text for film theory. <em>One-Way Street</em> and the work arising
from his unfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (<em>The
Arcades Project</em>), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural
theory and philosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin&rsquo;s
messianic understanding of history has been an enduring source of
theoretical fascination and frustration for a diverse range of
philosophical thinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben
and, in a critical context, J&uuml;rgen Habermas. The &lsquo;Critique
of Violence&rsquo; and &lsquo;On the Concept of History&rsquo; are
important sources for Derrida&rsquo;s discussion of messianicity,
which has been influential, along with Paul de Man&rsquo;s discussion
of allegory, for the poststructuralist reception of Benjamin&rsquo;s
writings. Aspects of Benjamin&rsquo;s thought have also been
associated with a revival of political theology, although it is
doubtful this reception is true to the tendencies of Benjamin&rsquo;s
own political thought. More recently, interest in Benjamin&rsquo;s
philosophy of education has been fuelled by the translations of his
<em>Early Writings</em> in 2011 and the transcripts of his radio
broadcasts for children (<em>Radio Benjamin</em>) in 2014.</p>

<h2><a id="BioSke">1. Biographical Sketch</a></h2>

<p>
Walter Bendix Schoenflies Benjamin was born on July 15, 1892, the
eldest of three children in a prosperous Berlin family from an
assimilated Jewish background. At the age of 13, after a prolonged
period of sickness, Benjamin was sent to a progressive co-educational
boarding school in Haubinda, Thuringia, where he formed an important
intellectual kinship with the liberal educational reformer Gustav
Wyneken. On his return to Berlin, he began contributing to <em>Der
Anfang</em> (&lsquo;The Beginning&rsquo;), a journal dedicated to
Wyneken&rsquo;s principles on the spiritual purity of youth, articles
which contain in embryonic form important ideas on experience and
history that continue to occupy his mature thought. As a student at
the universities of Freiburg im Breisgau and Berlin, Benjamin attended
lectures by the neo-Kantian philosopher Heinrich Rickert and the
sociologist Georg Simmel, whilst continuing to be actively involved in
the growing Youth Movement. In 1914, however, Benjamin denounced his
mentor and withdrew from the movement in response to a public lecture
in which Wyneken praised the ethical experience that the outbreak of
war afforded the young. In 1915 a friendship began between Benjamin
and Gerhard (later Gershom) Scholem, a fellow student at Berlin. This
relationship would have a lifelong influence upon Benjamin&rsquo;s
relation to Judaism and Kabbalism, notably in his interpretations of
Kafka in the early 1930s and in the messianic interpretation of the
Paul Klee painting <em>Angelus Novus</em> in his later theses
&lsquo;On the Concept of History&rsquo;. Scholem would prove
instrumental in establishing and, in part, shaping the legacy of
Benjamin&rsquo;s works after his death (Raz-Krakotzkin 2013).</p>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation, &lsquo;The Concept of Art
Criticism in German Romanticism&rsquo;, was awarded, <em>summa cum
laude</em>, by the University of Bern, Switzerland, in 1919. His
celebrated essay on Goethe&rsquo;s novella, <em>The Elective
Affinities</em>, was begun shortly after and put into practice the
theory of art criticism developed in his dissertation.
Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>Habilitationsschrift</em> on the <em>Origin of
the German Mourning-Play</em> (<em>Ursprung des deutschen
Trauerspiels</em>)&mdash;the thesis which would have enabled him to
become a professional academic&mdash;had, he feared, with the death of
his intellectual ally, the Protestant theologian Florens Christian
Rang, lost its &ldquo;proper reader&rdquo; (GB 3:16). In 1925, he was
forced to withdraw his submission from the University of Frankfurt am
Main and with it the possibility of a future academic position.
However, despite this academic failure, an excerpt from the work
appeared in a literary journal two years later and the book was
published the following year (1928), quickly receiving favourable
attention in a number of well-regarded newspapers and periodicals in
Germany and further afield (Brodersen 1996, 154). In an ironic twist,
Benjamin&rsquo;s failed <em>Habilitation</em> study became the subject
of a seminar course taught at Frankfurt University in 1932&ndash;3 by
Theodor Wiesengrund (later Theodor W. Adorno).</p>

<p>
Much of the writing for his thesis was completed in 1924 on the
Italian island of Capri, where Benjamin had retreated for financial
reasons. The stay would prove decisive, however, since it was here he
met the Bolshevik Latvian theatre producer Asja Lacis, with whom he
begun an erotically frustrated but intellectually productive
relationship. &lsquo;Naples&rsquo; was jointly written with Lacis in
1925, whilst <em>One-Way Street</em>, a quasi-constructivist
collection of fragments written between 1923&ndash;1926 and dedicated
to Lacis on its publication in 1928, and the unfinished <em>Arcades
Project</em>, begun in the late 1920s, both exhibit a modernist
experimentation with form that can in part be attributed to
Lacis&rsquo; influence. His Marxist turn towards historical
materialism was compounded by his enthusiastic study of Georg
Luk&aacute;cs&rsquo; <em>History and Class Consciousness</em> whilst
on Capri and a visit to Lacis in Soviet Moscow in the winter of
1926&ndash;7.</p>

<p>
By the early 1930s Benjamin was closely involved in the plans for a
left-wing periodical to be entitled &lsquo;Crisis and Critique&rsquo;,
in collaboration with Ernst Bloch, Sigfried Kracauer and, among
others, the Marxist poet, playwright and theatre director Bertolt
Brecht (Wizisla 2009, 66&ndash;98). Benjamin had been introduced to
Brecht by Lacis in 1929 and over the following decade developed a
close personal friendship, in which their literary and political
affinities had been cemented under the difficult conditions of
political exile. Benjamin undertook a series of studies of
Brecht&rsquo;s &ldquo;epic theatre&rdquo; and modelled the radio
broadcasts he wrote and presented during this period upon the
latter&rsquo;s experiments in theatrical didacticism (Brodersen 1996,
193). In 1933, Benjamin departed Nazi Germany for the last time,
following Adorno, Brecht and many other Jewish friends into an exile
he divided between Paris, Ibiza, San Remo and Brecht&rsquo;s house
near Svendborg, Denmark.</p>

<p>
During the 1930s the Institute for Social Research, by this point
under the directorship of Horkheimer and exiled from its base in the
University of Frankfurt, provided Benjamin with important
opportunities for publishing as well as an increasingly necessary
financial stipend, his primary source of income. Theodor W. Adorno,
who had been introduced to Benjamin a decade earlier by a mutual
friend, Siegfried Kracauer, was instrumental in securing this support.
An important consequence of this dependence, however, was the
editorial revisions to which key essays in which Benjamin developed
his materialist theory of art were subjected, such as &lsquo;The Work
of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility&rsquo; and those on
Baudelaire and Paris that grew out of <em>The Arcades Project</em>.
Arendt had claimed that, in particular, Benjamin&rsquo;s friendship
with Brecht &lsquo;endangered his relation to the Institute of Social
Research,&rsquo; leading to a fear the Institute would withdraw its
financial support and Benjamin&rsquo;s consequent docility towards
their editorial suggestions (Arendt 1968). Recent scholarship
(Erazo-Heufelder 2017; Mulder 2015; Fleck 2023) has offered a more
critical view of the Institute&rsquo;s mismanagement of funds and
inequitable distribution of financial and administrative support,
partially corroborating Arendt&rsquo;s concerns.</p>

<p>
With the outbreak of war in 1939, Benjamin was temporarily interned in
the French &ldquo;concentration camps&rdquo; established for German
citizens. On his release a few months later he returned to Paris and
there continued his work in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale on
<em>The Arcades Project</em>. The notes for his unfinished research
were left in the safekeeping of librarian and friend, the writer
Georges Bataille, as Benjamin fled Paris before the advancing German
army in the summer of 1940. The last few months of Benjamin&rsquo;s
life reflect the precarious experience of countless other Jewish
Germans in Vichy France: a flight to the border and preparations for
emigration. Lacking the necessary exit visa from France, he joined a
guided party that crossed the Pyrenees in an attempt to enter Spain as
illegal refugees. Turned back by customs officials, Benjamin took his
life in the small, Spanish border town of Port Bou, on September 27,
1940.</p>

<h2><a id="EarWorKanExp">2. Early Works: Kant and Experience</a></h2>

<p>
The importance of Benjamin&rsquo;s early unpublished fragments for an
understanding his wider philosophical project has been emphasised by a
number of scholars (Wolfharth 1992; Caygill 1998; Rrenban 2005).
Indeed, without them it becomes difficult to understand the
intellectual context and historical tradition out of which Benjamin is
writing and therefore nearly impossible to grasp the philosophical
underpinnings of his works. Of Benjamin&rsquo;s earliest published
writing his attempt in the essay entitled &lsquo;Experience&rsquo;
(&lsquo;<em>Erfahrung</em>&rsquo;, 1913/1914) to distinguish an
alternative and superior concept of experience provides a useful
introduction to a central and enduring preoccupation of his thought.
Benjamin&rsquo;s concern with delineating an immediate and
metaphysical experience of spirit is valuable in providing a thematic
description of a conceptual opposition working throughout his thought.
Filtered here through the cultural ideals of the Youth Movement, this
contrasts the empty, spiritless [<em>Geistlosen</em>] and unartistic
&ldquo;experiences&rdquo; accumulated over a life merely lived-through
[<em>erlebt</em>] with that privileged kind of experience which is
filled with spiritual content through its enduring contact with the
dreams of youth (SW 1, 3&ndash;6). The influence of Nietzsche in these
earlier texts is discernible (McFarland 2013), particularly, in the
importance the young Benjamin places upon aesthetic experience in
overcoming the embittered nihilism of contemporary values (although he
is unable to articulate this cultural transformation here beyond a
vague appeal to the canon of German poets: Schiller, Goethe,
H&ouml;lderlin, and Stefan George).</p>

<p>
By 1918 the attempt at a more systematic and philosophically
sophisticated understanding of a &ldquo;higher concept of
experience&rdquo; (SW 1, 102) within what Benjamin now calls
&ldquo;the coming philosophy&rdquo; is articulated in relation to
Kant&rsquo;s transcendental idealism. Benjamin argues that the value
of Platonic and Kantian philosophy lies in its attempt to secure the
scope and depth of knowledge through justification, exemplified in the
way Kant conducts a critical inquiry into the transcendental
conditions of knowledge. But this Kantian attempt to grasp a certain
and timeless knowledge is in turn based upon an empirical concept of
experience which is restricted, Benjamin argues, to that &ldquo;naked,
primitive, self evident&rdquo; experience of the Enlightenment, whose
paradigm is Newtonian physics (SW 1, 101). Despite Kant&rsquo;s
introduction of a transcendental subject, his system remains tied to a
na&iuml;ve empiricist understanding of experience, of the kind
privileged in the positivist scientific tradition as the encounter
between a distinct subject (conceived as a cognizing consciousness
receiving sensible intuitions) and object (understood as a
sensation-causing thing-in-itself).</p>

<p>
In contrast, the pre-Enlightenment concept of experience invested the
world with a deeper and more profound significance, because the
Creation assumes a revelatory religious importance. This is apparent
not only in the deeply Christian world-view of mediaeval Europe but
survives in secularized form in Renaissance and Baroque humanism, and
in &ldquo;Counter-Enlightenment&rdquo; thinkers such as J. G. Hamann,
Goethe, and the Romantics. Benjamin suggests that the &ldquo;great
transformation and correction which must be performed upon the concept
of experience, oriented so one-sidedly along mathematical-mechanical
lines, can be attained only by relating knowledge to language, as was
attempted by Hamann during Kant&rsquo;s lifetime&rdquo; (SW 1,
107&ndash;8). In the essay &lsquo;On Language as Such and the Language
of Man&rsquo; (&lsquo;<em>&Uuml;ber Sprache &uuml;berhaupt und
&uuml;ber die Sprache des Menschen</em>&rsquo;, c. 1916), Benjamin
offers a theological conception of language which draws on
Hamann&rsquo;s discussion of Creation as the physical imprint of the
divine Word of God, to claim that there &ldquo;is no event or thing in
either animate or inanimate nature that does not in some way partake
of language&rdquo; (SW 1, 62&ndash;3). This implies that all
experience&mdash;including perception&mdash;is essentially linguistic,
whilst all human language (including writing, typically associated
with mere convention) is inherently expressive and creative. Language
is privileged as a model of experience in these early essays precisely
because it undermines and transgresses the neat divisions and
limitations operating in the Kantian system, including that
fundamental one that distinguishes between the subject and object of
sensations. If both are constitutively linguistic, language serves as
a medium of experience that binds the ostensible &ldquo;subject&rdquo;
and &ldquo;object&rdquo; in a more profound, perhaps mystical,
relationship of underlying kinship. More generally, Hamann&rsquo;s
metacritique provides Benjamin with a sense of the hypocrisy of the
Kantian separation of understanding and sensibility on the basis of an
empty and purely formal notion of pure reason, which can itself only
be postulated according to the concrete, aesthetic content of
language.</p>

<p>
Whilst Benjamin is not interested in returning to the pre-critical
project of a rationalist deduction of experience, nor to a directly
religious conception of the world, he is interested in how the
scientific concept of experience that Kant is utilising distorts the
structure of Kant&rsquo;s philosophical system, and how this might be
corrected with the use of theological concepts. Epistemology must
address not only &ldquo;the question of the certainty of knowledge
that is lasting&rdquo;, but also the neglected question of &ldquo;the
integrity of an experience that is ephemeral&rdquo; (SW 1, 100).
Benjamin&rsquo;s suggestion as to how this project might be formulated
within the Kantian system is sketchy, but nonetheless indicates some
of the preoccupying concerns of his later writings. In general, it
involves the expansion of the limited spatio-temporal forms and
essentially causal-mechanistic categories of Kant&rsquo;s philosophy
through the integration of, for example, religious, historical,
artistic, linguistic and psychological experiences. Benjamin&rsquo;s
enduring concern with the new, the outmoded and the heteronomous
reflect this attempt to integrate more speculative phenomenological
possibilities of experience into the remit of philosophical knowledge.
It resists privileging any single discipline of knowledge, preserving
a multiplicity that implicates truth in the problem of aesthetic
representation. This would lead Benjamin to attempt a radical
rethinking of the philosophical concept of the Idea, away from its
dualistic associations with a timeless and purely rational essence of
things.</p>

<p>
Benjamin also believes that a more speculative metaphysics would
necessitate the abolishment of the sharp distinction between Nature
and Freedom&mdash;or causal mechanism and moral willing&mdash;in
Kant&rsquo;s architectonic. Since it is a specific understanding of
&ldquo;dialectic&rdquo; which mediates between these two spheres in
Kant&rsquo;s critical system, this entails a speculative rethinking of
the Kantian dialectic. This suggests that new possibilities of
syllogistic logical relations might themselves be opened up, including
what he calls &ldquo;a certain nonsynthesis of two concepts in
another&rdquo; (SW 1, 106; cf. Weber 2008, 48). The relation of
nonsynthesis hinted at here can be seen to inform Benjamin&rsquo;s
understanding of the Idea as a constellation of extremes in the
<em>Origin of the German Mourning-Play</em> and of the dialectical
image in his mature writings. In this sense, Benjamin&rsquo;s
metacritique of Kant represents an attempt to construct an alternative
post-Kantian tradition to that of Hegelian dialectics. It therefore
required a new philosophy of history.</p>

<h2><a id="RomGoeCri">3. Romanticism, Goethe and Criticism</a></h2>

<p>
Benjamin initially sought to develop these ideas in the context of
Kant&rsquo;s philosophy of history, believing it was in this context
that the problems of the Kantian system could be fully exposed and
challenged (C, 98). A very early article, &lsquo;The Life of
Students&rsquo; (&lsquo;<em>Das Leben der Studenten</em>&rsquo;,
1915), is useful for suggesting how these problems manifest themselves
within the philosophy of history. It rejects a &ldquo;a view of
history that puts its faith in the infinite extent of time and thus
concerns itself only with the speed, or lack of it, with which people
and epochs advance along the path of progress&rdquo; and contrasts
this with a perspective &ldquo;in which history appears to be
concentrated on a single focal point, like those that had
traditionally been found in the utopian images of the
philosophers&rdquo; (SW 1, 37). The latter, &lsquo;messianic&rsquo;
view of history has a distinct intention and methodology: it aims to
grasp how elements of what Benjamin calls &ldquo;the ultimate
condition&rdquo; and &ldquo;highest metaphysical state&rdquo; of
history&mdash;which we might call the historical Absolute&mdash;appear
not as the <em>telos</em> or end of history, but as an immanent state
of perfection which has the potential to manifest itself in any
particular moment (SW 1, 37). He claims that the necessary recognition
of such metaphysical condition requires an act of criticism
[<em>Kritik</em>] (SW 1, 38). Benjamin had initially proposed
Kant&rsquo;s philosophy of history as the topic of his doctoral
dissertation, and while he felt it necessary to change this to the
Early German Romantics&rsquo; philosophy of art, crucial features of
the proposed project survive in the final work. Astute readers, he
says, may still discern in it an &ldquo;insight into the relationship
of a truth to history&rdquo; (C, 135&ndash;6). Specifically, the
concept of art criticism operating in Romantic aesthetics rests upon
epistemological presuppositions that reveal the
&lsquo;messianic&rsquo; essence of Romanticism (SW 1, 116&ndash;7;
n.3, 185). The messianic conjunction between the highest metaphysical
state of history and the ephemerality of each particular moment is
here seen as theoretically determining the Romantic relationship
between the artistic Absolute&mdash;or what Benjamin defines as the
Idea of art&mdash;and each particular artwork.</p>

<p>
In his doctoral dissertation, Benjamin argues that the philosophical
relationship between the Idea of art and particular artworks posited
in Romantic aesthetics must be understood in relation to
Fichte&rsquo;s theory of reflection. This sought to ground the
possibility of a certain and immediate type of cognition without
recourse to the problematic notion of an intellectual intuition. For
Fichte, reflection indicates the free activity of consciousness taking
itself as its own object of thought: its capacity for thinking of
thinking. In doing so, the initial form of thinking is transformed
into its content. In such reflection, thought seems capable of
immediately grasping itself as a thinking subject and therefore of
possessing a certain kind of immediate and foundational knowledge.
Although Benjamin introduces a number of specific criticisms of
Fichte&rsquo;s philosophical position in his dissertation, he
nonetheless values the Fichtean concept of reflection for providing
the epistemological foundation of Friedrich Schlegel&rsquo;s and
Novalis&rsquo; understandings of the metaphysical function of art
criticism. Some scholars have, however, questioned the accuracy of
Benjamin&rsquo;s interpretation of Fichte&rsquo;s concept of
reflection and the importance he accords to it in Romantic
epistemology (Bullock 1987, 78&ndash;93; Menninghaus 2005,
29&ndash;44).</p>

<p>
Unlike in Fichte, here immediacy and infinitude are not mutually
exclusive aspects of cognition. The uniqueness of the Romantic concept
of the Absolute resides in the fact that the Romantic conception of
infinitude regards it not as empty but &ldquo;substantial and
filled&rdquo; (SW 1, 129). Benjamin argued that the Romantics
specifically identified this structure of the Absolute with the Idea
of art, and in particular with artistic form (SW 1, 135). Art
criticism becomes central to this concept of infinite fulfilment
because, like the epistemological relation between reflection and
thought in Fichte, criticism both consummates the finite and
particular work by raising it to a higher level&mdash;in which the
form of the work is transformed into content as the object of
criticism&mdash;and simultaneously connects the work&rsquo;s
particular artistic form with the continuity and unity of absolute
form in the Idea of art. Criticism is, for the Romantics, the
continuation and ongoing completion of the particular work through its
infinite connection with other art works and works of criticism. By
conceiving the Idea of art as a &lsquo;medium of reflection&rsquo;,
the early Romantics dissolve the Enlightenment world-view of the
positive sciences that Fichte inherited from Kant, and in doing so
overcome the critical injunctions placed upon the experience of the
infinite (SW 1, 132; 131). This conception of a fulfilled infinity
constitutes the messianism that Benjamin claims is essential to Early
Romantic epistemology.</p>

<p>
In the version of the dissertation formally submitted to the
university, Benjamin concludes by identifying the Romantic theory of
art criticism with &lsquo;the consummation of the work&rsquo; (SW 1,
177). The artwork provides the immanent criterion for critical
reflection, which in turn completes the work by raising it into an
autonomous and higher existence. This immanent criticism rejects both
the dogmatic imposition of external rules (such as those of classical
aesthetics) and the dissolution of aesthetic criteria (with the appeal
to artistic genius). It provides, Benjamin thought, one of the
fundamental legacies for a modern concept of art criticism. The
version circulated amongst friends and colleagues does not conclude
with a complete affirmation of Romanticism, however, but contains a
critical afterword that renders explicit the critical objections that
Benjamin had carefully inserted into the text. These suggest that the
Romantic theory of art, and by implication the structure of the
Absolute it is grounded upon, is problematically one-sided and
incomplete with regard to (1) its formalism, (2) its positivity, and
(3) its singularity.</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
Since the content of each, successive, level of reflection is supplied
by the form of its object, the criticism unfolds the germ of immanent
criticizability contained in each particular artwork&rsquo;s form.
This formalism precludes any serious discussion of the artwork&rsquo;s
specific content.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Conversely, anything immanently uncriticizable cannot constitute a
true work of art. As a consequence, Romantic criticism is unable to
differentiate between good or bad artworks, since its only criterion
is whether a work <em>is</em> or <em>is not</em> art. Such criticism
is entirely positive in its evaluation, and lacks the important
negative moment essential to judgement.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Finally, Schlegel &ldquo;committed the old error of confounding
&lsquo;abstract and &lsquo;universal&rsquo; when he believed he had to
make that [Absolute] ground [of art] into an individual&rdquo;,
Benjamin claims (SW 1, 166&ndash;7). He therefore gave a &ldquo;false
interpretation&rdquo; of the unity of all works when he conceived this
as pertaining to some mystical, singular and transcendental
work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The consequent need for what Benjamin presents as a Goethean
modification of Early German Romanticism is laid out in the afterword.
The relation between these criticisms of Romanticism and
Goethe&rsquo;s thought is suggested in the claim that,
&ldquo;Ultimately the mystical thesis that art itself is one
work&hellip;stands in exact correlation with the principle which
asserts the indestructibility of works that are purified in
irony&rdquo; (SW 1, 167). With its mistaken emphasis on the
singularity of the Idea of art, Romantic fulfilment only coincides
with the infinity of the unconditioned, meaning that fulfilment is an
essentially non-historical category of the infinite. Such criticism
cannot be described as judgement, since all authentic judgement
involves an essential negative moment of completion in
&ldquo;self-annihilation&rdquo; (SW 1, 152). Consequently, because
&lsquo;Romantic messianism is not at work in its full force&rsquo;
here (SW 1, 168), the Romantics were increasingly forced to turn to
the &ldquo;accoutrements&rdquo; of ethics, religion and politics to
provide the content required to complete their theory of art.</p>

<p>
Goethe&rsquo;s conception of aesthetic judgement and his principle of
the &lsquo;uncriticizability&rsquo; of great works provided Benjamin
with a way of thinking the necessary modification to the Early German
Romantic Idea of art. His explication of the implicit metaphysical
structure of Goethe&rsquo;s corresponding Ideal of art reveals the
contrasting features of his structure of the Absolute: as a sphere of
pure content, a medium of destructive <em>refraction</em>, and a
plurality of discontinuous archetypes (Charles 2020, 53&ndash;67).
Because finite, particular works can never be romanticized into the
unity of an individual Absolute, they remains immanently incomplete
and yet nonetheless incapable of higher consummation: a
&ldquo;torso&rdquo;, dismembered in relation to the whole, corpse-like
in its deadness. In this context, the true task of criticism becomes
not the consummation of the living work, but that destructive
completion of the dying one.</p>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay on &lsquo;Goethe&rsquo;s <em>Elective
Affinities</em>&rsquo; (1924&ndash;5) provides an exemplary piece of
such criticism, whilst developing the concept further by situating it
more explicitly within the context of history. Here, criticism is
charged with the task of revealing what Benjamin calls the
&ldquo;truth content of a work of art&rdquo;, which is intimately
bound up with its &ldquo;material content&rdquo; at the beginning of
the work&rsquo;s history (SW 1, 297). In contrast to mere
commentary&mdash;which proceeds no further than a consideration of
these now historically anachronistic features of its material
content&mdash;the aim of criticism is the destruction of this outer
layer in order for the work&rsquo;s inner truth content to be grasped.
The fundamental philological error of commentary is merely to situate
the work in relation to the &ldquo;lived experience
[<em>Erlebnis</em>]&rdquo; of its author&rsquo;s biographical life
(exemplified in Friedrich Gundolf&rsquo;s 1916 biography of
<em>Goethe</em>), instead of the broader medium of historical
reception through which it has passed down to the contemporary critic.
Benjamin&rsquo;s Romantic theory of immanent criticism insists that
the work must contain its own inner criterion, such that the critic
proceeds from the work itself and not from the life of the author (SW
1, 321). Beginning, therefore, with the odd and striking features of
Goethe&rsquo;s work that come to preoccupy later critics, Benjamin
examines how these are derived from techniques borrowed from the
distinct form of the novella. This novella-like construction grants
the <em>Elective Affinities</em> its strange, fable-like quality,
which differentiates it from the naturalism of a typical novel. It is
this mythical layer, as the real material content of the work, which
expresses the presence of a pantheistic and &ldquo;daemonic&rdquo;
attitude toward nature in Goethe&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>
Truth content, in contrast, is not to be sought in the conspicuous
features of the work&rsquo;s technique, but in the unity of its
distinct form. The task of criticism is to make this truth content an
object of experience. It concerns itself not with the life or
intentions of the artist, but with that semblance or appearance of
life that the work itself possesses by virtue of its mimetic capacity
for representation: its linguistic expressiveness, which is described
as a verging and bordering on life (SW 1, 350). What is essential to
art, however, and what distinguishes it from the semblance of nature,
is the &ldquo;expressionless [<em>Ausdruckslose</em>]&rdquo;: that
critical violence within the work of art that &ldquo;arrests this
semblance, spellbinds the movement, and interrupts the harmony&rdquo;
(SW 1, 340). &ldquo;Only the expressionless completes the work&rdquo;
<em>as</em> a work of art, Benjamin argues, and it does so by
shattering the work&rsquo;s semblance of unity, the false appearance
of totality pertaining to it. Unlike the intensification of Romantic
reflection, when this semblance itself becomes the object of a
higher-level semblance, a refractive dissonance is opened up. Drawing
on H&ouml;lderlin&rsquo;s concept of the caesura to describe this
moment, Benjamin calls it a &ldquo;counter-rhythmic rupture&rdquo; (SW
1, 341). In focusing its efforts on representing this caesura, genuine
criticism in turn deepens the refractive violence, performing a
destructive or mortuary act of self-annihilation upon the work.</p>

<p>
Art, at the very limit of its mimetic capacity, draws attention to its
construction and in doing so finds the resources to encapsulate a
deeper truth. It is against what Benjamin calls the Christian-mystical
certainty in future reconciliation (which Goethe inserts into the
conclusion of the novella as an attempt to counter the mythical
fatalism which holds sway elsewhere) that he instead endorses the
paradoxical glimmer of hope identified with the image of a shooting
star which appears in Goethe&rsquo;s novella (SW 1, 354&ndash;5). If
the image of the star retains its relationship to the symbolic here,
it does so in accordance with Benjamin&rsquo;s earlier description of
the expressionless as &ldquo;the torso of a symbol&rdquo; (SW 1, 340).
However, it might be better to understand the significance of the
caesura here in the context of the theory of allegory. This is only
properly formulated in Benjamin&rsquo;s next major work, his thesis on
the <em>Origin of the German Mourning-Play</em> (<em>Ursprung des
deutschen Trauerspiels</em>, 1928).</p>

<h2><a id="BarCon">4. Baroque Constellations</a></h2>

<p>
&lsquo;Mourning-play&rsquo; (<em>Trauerspiel</em>) is a term used to
characterise a type of drama that emerges during the baroque period of
art history in the late 16th and early 17th century. The principle
examples discussed in Benjamin&rsquo;s thesis come not from its great
exponents, Pedro Calder&oacute;n de la Barca and William Shakespeare,
but the German dramatists Martin Opitz, Andreas Gryphius, Johann
Christian Hallmann, Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein, and August Adolf von
Haugwitz. Their plays are characterised by a simplicity of action
which is comparable to the classicism of earlier Renaissance theatre,
but also contain peculiarly baroque features. These include an
exaggerated and violent bombast in their language (including a
figurative tendency towards linguistic contraction), an absence of
psychological depth in its characters, a preponderance of and
dependency upon theatrical props and machinery, and a crude emphasis
on violence, suffering and death (cf. Newman 2011; Ferber 2013).</p>

<p>
Leaving aside for now the methodological introduction (referred to in
English as the &lsquo;Epistemo-Critical Prologue&rsquo;), the first
part of Benjamin&rsquo;s thesis is concerned with repudiating the
dogmatic attempt by later critics to impose onto these plays the
external criteria of Aristotelian aesthetics, which are rooted in
classical tragedy. Benjamin&rsquo;s understanding of tragedy here (and
his approach to the mourning-play in general) is partially influenced
by Friedrich Nietzsche&rsquo;s <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>. Benjamin
claims that <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> substantiates the critical
insight that the empathy of undirected modern feeling is unhelpful for
properly grasping ancient tragedy (OGT, 93). Instead, Nietzsche
undertook a metaphysical inquiry into the essence of tragedy as a
dialectical interplay of the contrasting aesthetic impulses of
Apollonian semblance and Dionysian truth. This dialectic is central to
Benjamin&rsquo;s own philosophical investigations, particularly his
claim&mdash;derived from his discussion of Goethe&rsquo;s <em>Elective
Affinities</em>&mdash;that an expressionless moment is constitutive of
art, in which the limits of semblance are broached precisely in order
to illuminate an artistic truth.</p>

<p>
But Benjamin is also critical of Nietzsche for restricting his
approach to aesthetics, and therefore renouncing the understanding of
tragedy in historical terms. Lacking a philosophy of history,
Nietzsche&rsquo;s study was unable to situate the political and
ethical significance of the metaphysical and mythical features it
isolates (OGT, 93). Influenced by ideas from Franz Rosenzweig and
Florens Christian Rang (Asman 1992), Benjamin presents tragedy as
expressing a perceived break between the prehistorical age of mythical
gods and heroes and the emergence of a new ethical and political
community. The historical limitations of Nietzsche&rsquo;s theory of
tragedy become acute when it comes to the question of the possibility
of a recuperation of the tragic form in modern theatre. Whilst
Nietzsche tends to simply denounce the weakness of modern drama
against the strength of the Greeks (excepting, in his early work, the
operas of Wagner), Benjamin is concerned with establishing whether the
historical conditions of the tragic form are themselves a limit to its
contemporary efficacy.</p>

<p>
In line with the principles of Romantic criticism discussed above,
mourning-plays contain their own distinct form and should be
criticised according to their own immanently discovered standards. The
&ldquo;content [<em>Gehalt</em>]&rdquo; and &ldquo;true object&rdquo;
of the baroque mourning-play is not, as it is in tragedy, myth but
rather historical life (OGT, 46). As with Goethe&rsquo;s borrowing of
the novella form, this content is in part derived from other aesthetic
structures, principally the eschatological focus of mediaeval
Christian literature: the Passion-Plays, Mystery-Plays and chronicles
whose historiography portrayed &ldquo;the whole of the course of
history, world history as salvation history&rdquo; (OGT, 65). But the
Lutheran renunciation of the Catholic emphasis upon good works, and
the secularizing tendency implicit in the naturalistic legal and
political philosophies of the 16th and 17th century (discussed in
relation to Carl Schmitt&rsquo;s theory of sovereignty) resulted in
the stripping bare of human value and significance from such history.
This tense, antinomical combination of transcendence and immanence
produces an uneasy hybrid, in which history&mdash;as a narrative of
the human march towards redemption on the Day of Judgement&mdash;loses
the eschatological certainty of its redemptive conclusion, and becomes
secularized into a mere natural setting for the profane struggle over
political power.</p>

<p>
In the second part of his thesis, Benjamin employs the concept of
allegory to expose the implicit eschatological structure of these
works. However, the first part utilises the distorting tension of this
structure to distinguish the specific and historically conspicuous
technique of the German baroque mourning-play. This concludes by
identifying sorrow or mourning (<em>Trauer</em>) as the predominant
mood inherent to its metaphysical structure, in contrast to the
suffering of tragedy. With the &ldquo;total secularization of the
historical in the state of creation&hellip;History passes into the
setting&rdquo; to become natural history (OGT, 81), whose attendant
cognition is a melancholic contemplation of things which derives
enigmatic satisfaction from its very recognition of their transience
and emptiness (OGT, 141). &ldquo;For all wisdom of the melancholic
hearkens to the deep&rdquo;, Benjamin claims: &ldquo;it is won from
immersion in the life of creaturely things, and nothing of the voice
of revelation reaches it. Everything to do with Saturn points into the
depths of the earth&rdquo; (OGT, 157).</p>

<p>
It should be briefly noted here that while Benjamin&rsquo;s
preoccupation with melancholy has been legitimately extended as a
leitmotif more broadly across the events of his own life and thought,
the <em>Trauerspiel</em> book&rsquo;s suggestion that the comic is the
&ldquo;essential inner side of mourning&rdquo; (OGT, 123) points to an
underdeveloped aspect of his philosophy, which nonetheless echoes his
claim that comic action is the shadow cast by the tragic (SW1, 206).
The claim, in the essay on &lsquo;Fate and Character&rsquo; (1921),
that within such a comic shadow a truer conception of natural
innocence and freedom may be discerned (SW1, 206) offers a counterpart
to absolutization of <em>Schuld</em> (guilt/debt) without atonement
that is produced by capitalism as a &ldquo;purely cultic
religion&rdquo; (SW1, 288) and the fatalism that follows, even for
Nietzsche, Marx and Freud (SW1, 289). Although this aspect of
Benjamin&rsquo;s thought has received relatively little attention
compared to his work on tragedy and mourning, it continues to inform,
for example, his physiognomies of &ldquo;left-wing melancholy&rdquo;
(SW2, 423&ndash;427) and &ldquo;the destructive character&rdquo; (SW2,
541&ndash;2), his positive evaluation of Chaplin&rsquo;s comedies and
Brecht&rsquo;s epic theatre, and the approach to radio plays in his
later writings (cf. Bontea 2006; Allen and Chari 2015; Feuer 2018 and
more broadly Feuer&rsquo;s blog
 <a href="https://schlemielintheory.com">https://schlemielintheory.com</a>;
 Barale 2019; Lewis 2020; Kolour 2023).</p>

<p>
To grasp how the form of these works are determined by their truth
content requires a reconstruction of the baroque concept of the
allegorical which structures its mood of melancholic
contemplativeness. Benjamin&rsquo;s claim is that a genuine
understanding of the allegorical as it emerged in its highest form in
the 17th century has been obscured by, on the one hand, the later
Romantic aestheticizing of the symbol and, on the other, by the
tendency to conceive the allegorical negatively in its contrast with
this devalued, aesthetic concept. It is only by first recovering a
genuine theological concept of the symbol, therefore, that we are able
in turn to distinguish an authentic concept of the allegorical. This
it to be done by reasserting the profound but paradoxical theological
unity between the material and the transcendental found in the
symbolic. The fundamental distinction between theological concepts of
symbol and the allegory will then be seen as concerning not their
differing objects (Idea vs. abstract concept), but the differing ways
in which they signify, express or represent this object. Benjamin will
conclude that this difference is, specifically, a temporal one.</p>

<p>
Drawing on undeveloped insights found in the work of the mythographers
Georg Friedrich Creuzer and Johann Joseph von G&ouml;rres, Benjamin
points out how &ldquo;the temporal measure for the experience of the
symbol[<em>Symbolerfahrung</em>] is the mystical instant
[<em>Nu</em>]&rdquo; (OGT, 173). We must understand the temporality of
the allegorical, in contrast, as something dynamic, mobile, and fluid.
This authentic concept of allegory arises in the 17th century baroque
as a response to the antithesis between mediaeval religiosity and
Renaissance secularization discussed earlier. The spatialization of
the temporal structure of eschatology in the allegorical corresponds
to the naturalization of the religious structure of history in the
baroque: &ldquo;Whereas in the symbol, with the sublimation of
downfall, the transfigured countenance of nature reveals itself
fleetingly in the light of salvation, in allegory there lies before
the eyes of the observer the <em>facies hippocratica</em> [lit.
&lsquo;Hippocratic face&rsquo; = the sunken, hollow and pinched
features exhibited by the dying] of history as petrified primal
landscape. History, in everything untimely, sorrowful, and miscarried
that belongs to it from the beginning, is inscribed in a
face&mdash;no, in a death&rsquo;s head [<em>Totenkopfe</em>]&rdquo;
(OGT, 174).</p>

<p>
From the perspective of the allegorical, the instantaneous
transformation within the symbolic becomes a natural history slowed to
such an extreme that every sign appears frozen and&mdash;seemingly
loosened from every other relationship&mdash;arbitrary. The concrete
corporeality of the written script exemplifies this allegorical
emphasis upon things. Allegory is not the <em>conventional</em>
representation of some expression, as misunderstood by later critics,
but an <em>expression</em> of convention [<em>Ausdruck der
Konvention</em>] (OGT, 185). Allegorical expression includes as its
object this very conventionality of the historical, this appearance of
insignificance and indifference. That is, convention itself comes to
be signified or expressed. What Benjamin rediscovers in the
allegorical is, then, something akin to the concept of the
expressionless, as the torso of a symbol, introduced in the essay on
Goethe. Benjamin argues that this predominance of the allegorical
viewpoint in the 17th century baroque finds it most dramatic
expression in the mourning-play, and that consequently the Idea of the
mourning-play must be grasped via the allegorical.</p>

<p>
The <em>Erkenntniskritische Vorrede</em> or &lsquo;Epistemo-Critical
Prologue&rsquo; to the work may be understood as having two central
functions: it provides a direct methodological justification for the
theory of criticism being utilised in the work, by way of a
problematization of existing disciplinary approaches, and it
implicitly recovers a concept of allegorical experience which is
delineated in the second part of the thesis in terms amenable for
modernity. At the level of methodology, Benjamin advocates the
necessity of a transdisciplinary approach (Osborne 2011, 24) to
artworks, capable of critically overcoming the epistemological and
historical limitations of the existing disciplines of the philosophy
of art and the history of art (specifically, literary history). This
transdisciplinary aspect of Benjamin&rsquo;s thesis may partially
account for the difficulties in its reception at the University of
Frankfurt, where the thesis was rejected by the departments of both
philosophy and literature. Much of the theoretical discussion in the
Prologue is concerned with correcting the methodological one-sidedness
of each existing approach by way of the positive features of the
other. In general, the philosophy of art correctly attends to the
problem of essences, but remains hampered by its lack of any adequate
historical consideration. Conversely, the history of art is
preoccupied with historical lineage but has no adequate concept of
essence. Yet it is not simply an amalgamation of aesthetics and
history that is required, but their radical rethinking in accordance
with first a historical concept of essence and second a philosophical
concept of history.</p>

<p>
Broadly speaking, Benjamin&rsquo;s theory of Ideas transposes the
philosophical problem of metaphysical realism into the context of
aesthetics. That is, it asks about the reality of aesthetic genres
such as &lsquo;tragedy&rsquo; or of artistic epochs such as the
&lsquo;Renaissance&rsquo; that classify a group of particular works
according to a set of common characteristics. The Prologue criticises
existing traditions of aesthetic nominalism for their inadequate
resolution of the problem. The uncritical use of inductive methods
demonstrated by literary historians rejects the hypostatization of
terms such as &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; on the grounds that it
promotes a false identity between similar empirical features, which
obscures their diversity. This aversion to any realism of constitutive
Ideas is grounded on the positivist criterion of factual verification.
A term like the &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; is consequently utilised by
them only on the proviso that it is understood as merely an abstract
general concept. This quickly leads to scepticism, however, since its
still fails to address the problematic criteria by which this general
concept is initially picked out and abstracted from the multiplicity
of particulars or on what grounds these particulars are grouped
together. Consequently, it fails to appreciate the necessity of the
Platonic postulation of Ideas for the representation of essences:
whilst concepts seek to make the similar identical, Ideas are
necessary to effect a dialectical synthesis between phenomenal
extremes (OGT, 18&ndash;19). In contrast, philosophers of art possess
a concern with the essential that ends up renouncing any notion of
generic forms, on the grounds that the singular originality of every
single work entails the only possible essential genre must be the
universal and individual one of art itself. The error&mdash;as
Benjamin had previously charged the Early German Romantics, discussed
above&mdash;is to dissolve real and important aesthetic structures or
forms into an undifferentiated unity (of art), which denies their
irreducible multiplicity (OGT, 21&ndash;23).</p>

<p>
The theory of Ideas presented in the Prologue is truncated and
difficult to understand outside the context of Benjamin&rsquo;s
earlier works, and the philosophical tradition that it engages with is
further obscured in the first English translation. However, the
critical aspects of Benjamin&rsquo;s investigation
advocate&mdash;against aesthetic versions of positivist
empiricism&mdash;a metaphysical realism, and, against certain versions
of philosophical idealism, a non-singular essentialism. That is, he
does not restrict the possibility of metaphysical reality only to
actual empirical particulars and he advocates the multiplicity and not
singularity of the essence (understood, in Goethean terms, as a
harmony and not a unity of truth). In doing so, he must address that
&lsquo;theological&rsquo; paradox, mentioned in the discussion of
symbol and allegory, of how the transcendental/supersensuous appears
immanently within the material/sensuous. Benjamin is clear that the
relation between Ideas and phenomenon is neither one of Aristotelian
&lsquo;containment&rsquo; nor one of Kantian lawfulness or hypothesis.
Ideas are not given to some intellectual intuition, but they are
capable of being sensuously represented. Such a sensuous
representation of the truth remains the task of philosophy.</p>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s theoretical elaboration proceeds by startling
imagistic reconfigurations of pre-existing elements within the
philosophical tradition. He offers a number of possibilities for
thinking such Ideas in the Prologue, taken from the realm not only of
philosophy but of aesthetics, theology and science. The first is the
Platonic Idea, here divorced from its association with the scientific
ascent to some purely rational, objective knowledge (such as appears
in the account of dialectic in the <em>Republic</em>) and instead
linked to the discussion of beautiful semblance in the
<em>Symposium</em> (OGT, 6). The second is that of the Adamic Name, as
developed in his earlier theory of language. In this context, he
comments that the Early German Romantics were frustrated in their
attempt to renew the theory of Ideas because truth took on the
character of reflective consciousness for them, rather than that
intentionless, linguistic character in which things were subsumed
under essential Names by Adam&rsquo;s primal-interrogation
[<em>urvernehmen</em>] (OGT, 15). Naming is the primal history
[<em>Urgeschicte</em>] of signifying, indicating a thing-like
disinterest which contrasts with the directed, unifying intentionality
of Husserlian phenomenology (OGT, 14). The third is the Goethean
Ideal, which is recalled here in the context of the Faustian
&ldquo;Mothers&rdquo; and which implicitly gestures towards his
earlier discussions of Goethe (OGT, 11). Finally, and most famously,
Benjamin compares the virtual objectivity of the Idea represented
through the reconfiguring of actual phenomena to an astrological
constellation, which simultaneously groups together and is revealed by
the cluster of individual stars (OGT, 11). Truth is said to be
&ldquo;actualized in the round dance of presented Ideas
[<em>vergegenw&auml;rtigt im Reigen der dargestellen
Ideen</em>]&rdquo; (OGT, 4). This concept of the constellation is
taken up directly in Adorno&rsquo;s inaugural lecture &lsquo;The
Actuality of Philosophy&rsquo;, where he speaks of &lsquo;the
manipulation of conceptual material by philosophy&hellip;of grouping
and trial arrangement, of constellation and construction&rsquo;
(Adorno 1931, 131). It comes to inform Benjamin&rsquo;s philosophical
practice in his major writings from this point onwards, from
<em>One-Way Street</em> (1928), via the methodological demand for the
construction of history and the attendant theory of the dialectical
image in his work related to the &ldquo;Arcades Project&rdquo; in the
1930s, through to the concept of history presented in his celebrated
late essay, &lsquo;On the Concept of History&rsquo; (1940).</p>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s concern to reincorporate the perspective of
art&rsquo;s temporal transformation demands an analogous
radicalization. The &ldquo;genetic and concrete classification&rdquo;
(OGT, 24) that Benedetto Croce called history (in order to distinguish
it from that generalizing thought that abstracts away from change and
development) must now be reconciled with Benjamin&rsquo;s theory of
Ideas. For the messianic philosophy of history that grounds
Benjamin&rsquo;s work problematizes existing formulations of the
concepts of history and historical origin. In line with his discussion
of the Idea, the concept of historical origin should not be reduced to
the causality and actuality of the empirically factual, nor should it
be regarded as a purely logical and timeless essence. It is not
merely, Benjamin argues, &ldquo;the coming-to-be of what has
originated&rdquo; and cannot be recognized in &ldquo;the naked,
manifest existence of the factual&rdquo; (OGT, 24). For the
&lsquo;historical&rsquo; sequence that permits the Idea to be
represented must include not only that of the actual phenomena of a
given period, but also that of their subsequent development in the
understanding of later epochs. An investigation of the essence of the
German mourning-play, for example, cannot restrict itself to
contemporaneous events and actual plays as if these were
&lsquo;facts&rsquo; settled and decided once and for all, but must
also investigate the changing understanding of this historical epoch
and the varying reception of these plays, including the prior
conditions of its own self-understanding. But nor is it a
&ldquo;purely logical&rdquo; category, as if the Idea were some
essence detached from and unrelated to history, to be grasped through
an abstraction from all these particular historical developments (OGT,
25). Origin [<em>Ursprung</em>] is therefore distinguished from a
merely genetic coming-into-being [<em>Enstehung</em>] and evolutionary
development of &lsquo;pure history&rsquo;, to include the essential
inner history of the &ldquo;life of the works and forms&rdquo; (OGT,
24&ndash;6). The &ldquo;science of the Origin&rdquo; is a
philosophical history, a history of the essential, whose contemplation
enlists a dialectical perspective to grasp the form of the
&ldquo;original phenomenon&rdquo;: as something subject to a process
of becoming and disappearing, and therefore only partial and
incomplete. Benjamin once again resorts to an image: &ldquo;The origin
stands as eddy in the stream of becoming and vigorously draws the
emerging material into its rhythm&rdquo; (OGT, 24). Criticism attempts
to virtually reassemble the fore- and after-history [<em>Vor- und
Nachgeschichte</em>] of the phenomena into a historical constellation,
in which the Idea is represented and the phenomena redeemed. This is
its messianic function in relation to the historical Absolute.</p>

<p>
The Prologue also seeks to rescue the allegorical experience
recognised in the mourning-plays for a modern theory of criticism.
Allegorical contemplation aims at the ruination of things so that it
can, in its redemptive moment, construct [<em>baun</em>] a new whole
out of the elements of the old. The character of this construction
distinguishes it from the creative invention of fantasy, since it
manipulates and rearranges pre-existing material. To leave an imprint
or impression of this construction [<em>Konstruktion</em>] is one of
its aims. This dual emphasis upon destruction and construction has led
a number of scholars to see an anticipation of Derridean
deconstruction in Benjamin&rsquo;s work (Fischer 1996, Section 1:
Modernity/Postmodernity; Weber 2008, 122&ndash;128), although it
should be noted that his consideration of the specific historicity of
this concept of criticism and his insistence of the immanent truth
content of artworks remains resolutely modernist, and cannot be easily
assimilated into any &lsquo;postmodernist&rsquo; position (cf. Weigel
1996, xiv). The underlying affinity between romanticism and the
baroque lies in their shared modernist concern with correcting
classicism in art and the quasi-mythical perspective of classicism in
general (OGT, 230; 185). The Prologue reflects upon this
&lsquo;modernity&rsquo; of the baroque when it notes how the
&ldquo;Striking analogies to the current state of German literature
have repeatedly given rise to &hellip;immersion in the Baroque&rdquo;
(OGT, 36). Although Benjamin is citing the similarities between
Expressionism in modern literature and the Mannerist exaggeration of
the baroque, his own reconstruction of allegorical experience and its
value for aesthetic theory is experienced according to a historical
conjunction between the baroque past and the modernity of
Benjamin&rsquo;s present: modernity both reveals and is revealed in
the baroque.</p>

<h2><a id="Politics">5. Politics</a></h2>

<p>
If the book on <em>Trauerspiel</em> (originating 1916, written
1923&ndash;1925, published 1928) concluded Benjamin&rsquo;s German
&ldquo;cycle of production&rdquo; (C, 322), a new cycle was initiated
with <em>One-Way Street</em> (<em>Einbahnstra&szlig;e</em>) (written
1923&ndash;6, published 1928), whose form and content puts into
practice that speculative concept of experience, with its allegorical
immersion into the depths of things. The city furnishes the sensuous,
imagistic material for <em>One-Way Street</em>, whilst the genres of
the leaflet, placard and advertisement provide the constructive
principle by which it is rearranged as a constellation. This formal
methodology resembles the technological media of photography and film,
as well as the avant-garde practices of Russian Constructivism and
French Surrealism. This involves what Adorno described as a
&ldquo;philosophy directed against philosophy&rdquo; (Adorno 1955,
235) or what Howard Caygill calls Benjamin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;philosophizing beyond philosophy&rdquo; (Caygill 1998,
120).</p>

<p>
The overlap and transition between these two cycles is visible in the
contrast between Benjamin&rsquo;s reflections on sovereign violence in
the sixteenth century in the <em>Trauerspiel</em> book and his
discussion of contemporary revolutionary violence in his
&lsquo;Critique of Violence&rsquo; (1921), one of the few remaining
pieces from what was planned as a large-scale study of political
thought initiated at the turn of the 1920s (Steiner 2001, 61). The
latter included a number of lost pieces relating to &lsquo;the true
politics&rsquo; and a series of aphorisms that were eventually
transformed into <em>One-Way Street</em>, alongside the notes on
&lsquo;Capitalism as Religion,&rsquo; elements of which were also
incorporated into the latter (Fenves and Ng 2021, 16&ndash;17, 117,
304).</p>

<p>
The &lsquo;Critique of Violence&rsquo; demonstrates Benjamin&rsquo;s
continuing concern with the Kantian and post-Kantian philosophical
traditions, in particular Herman Cohen&rsquo;s attempt to synthesize
neo-Kantianism and Judaism in his <em>Ethics of Pure Will</em>. The
title under which the project as a whole was conceived, &lsquo;The
True Politics&rsquo;, was taken from Kant&rsquo;s essay on
<em>Perpetual Peace</em> and the title of a planned chapter,
&lsquo;Teleology without Final Purpose,&rsquo; alludes to Kant&rsquo;s
discussions of aesthetic and teleological judgements in the
<em>Critique of the Power of Judgment</em> (Fenves and Ng 2021,
18&ndash;19). But it also shows Benjamin&rsquo;s &ldquo;turn to
political thought&rdquo; (GB, 2:60) in the tumultuous post-war period,
just prior to his more sustained encounter with Marxism via
Gy&ouml;rgy Luk&aacute;cs&rsquo;s <em>History and Class
Consciousness</em> and the Soviet theatre director Asja Lacis, on the
island of Capri in 1924. The project therefore marks both a continuity
with and a break from what Irving Wohlfarth has called his earlier
&ldquo;politics of Youth&rdquo; (Wohlfarth 1992, 164). If, as Benjamin
remarks, his break from the Youth Movement did not constitute the
abandonment of this earlier thought but its submergence into a
&ldquo;harder, purer, more invisible radicalism&rdquo; (C, 74), this
in part accounts for what Clark describes as the &lsquo;cryptic&rsquo;
character of the anthropological materialism of <em>The Arcades
Project</em>, where, Clark remarks, it is &ldquo;as if such a politics
were being actively aired and developed elsewhere&rdquo; (Clark 2003,
45&ndash;46).</p>

<p>
In part because of its singular place within this largely lost
project, in part because its neglect for many years, and in part
because of its own ambiguous construction, the &lsquo;Critique of
Violence [<em>Gewalt</em>]&rsquo; has recently come to acquire an
important role in the reception of Benjamin&rsquo;s work and a
&ldquo;canonic status in radical political theory and
philosophy&rdquo; more generally (Greenberg 2008, 324). The immediate
context of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay relates to the general strike of
March 1920, which had defeated an attempted military coup against the
social democratic coalition that had come to government in the wake of
the 1918 revolution. In September that year, in the context of a
discussion of the coup, the journal <em>Bl&auml;tter f&uuml;r
Reli&ouml;sen Sozialismus</em> published a juridical analysis of the
legal right to the use of <em>Gewalt</em>, which started from the
hypothesis that only the state has such a right, a position Benjamin
opposes.</p>

<p>
As the range of examples Benjamin includes in his response demonstrate
&ndash; strike action, martial law, conscription, capital punishment,
legal contracts, legal rights, police power, warfare, revolutions,
mythical violence and divine judgement &ndash; the term
<em>Gewalt</em> indicates power, force or authority as well as the
physical violence that is employed to preserve it or to challenge it.
Because, for Benjamin, the concept is closely connected to the spheres
of law and justice, it also concerns the coercive or uncoercive
relationship between means and ends. Benjamin&rsquo;s examples seek to
reveal the various ways in which violence and law comingle as either
&lsquo;lawmaking [<em>rechtsetzende</em>]&rsquo; or
&lsquo;law-preserving [<em>rechtserhaltende</em>]&rsquo; force, as
well as the ways the state insists on the separation and distinction
between them in order to conceal its own monopolization of violence.
In strike action, for example, the &ldquo;moment of violence&hellip;
is necessarily introduced, in the form of extortion &hellip;if it
takes place in the context of a conscious readiness to resume the
suspended action under certain circumstances that either have nothing
whatever to do with this action or only superficially modify it&rdquo;
(SW1, 239). The state concedes the right to strike &ndash; and thus
interposes legal means and ends for such coercion &ndash; under such
circumstances because &ldquo;it forestalls violent actions the state
is afraid to oppose&rdquo; (SW1, 245). In this way, even a general
strike (as with the general strike of March 1920) can function to
establish and to preserve the law of the state. Khatib (2017, 616) has
extended Benjamin&rsquo;s example of the conflation of lawmaking and
law-preserving in police violence to global practices of colonialism,
imperialism, and post-colonial legality under the conditions of the
capitalist world market. Benjamin concludes that it cannot be a
question of the ends pursued that invalidates violence in such
instances but rather that the use of force by individuals is in itself
an existential threat to the functioning of the law and its
institutions.</p>

<p>
To avoid the circularity that follows when the legitimacy of using
force is analysed only in relation to the ends pursued (since these
ends have been determined by the state that has, historically,
utilized violence as a means to its possession of power), Benjamin
seeks to develop a critical analysis of <em>Gewalt</em> that considers
its ethical legitimacy as a means, independent of any ends pursued.
Conflating both coercive forms of lawmaking and law-preserving
violence together as forms of mythic violence, Benjamin seeks to
deduce and so justify the possibility of an ethical use of violence
that is distinct from all mythical inauguration of power and so
identified as law-destroying force. In Kantian terms, the
&lsquo;Critique of Violence&rsquo; deduces such a possibility through
the postulation of divine violence whose expiatory power, because it
is connected to a higher sphere of justice rather than the law, cannot
be known within human history. Only the assurance of such divine
violence &ldquo;furnishes proof that revolutionary violence, the
highest manifestation of unalloyed violence by humans, is possible,
and shows by what means&rdquo; (SW1, 252).</p>

<p>
Drawing on the French political theorist Georges Sorel&rsquo;s
<em>Reflections on Violence</em>, Benjamin delineates the proletarian
or <em>revolutionary</em> general strike from the <em>political</em>
strike in the following terms: while the first form of interruption of
work is a &lsquo;violent&rsquo; and law-making means, since it takes
place in readiness to resume work under the modified conditions it
demands of those in power, the second is a nonviolent and anarchistic
&ldquo;pure means&rdquo; (SW1, 246). Benjamin&rsquo;s position does
not deny a moral right to use violence as such but does deny it
&ldquo;to every human institution, community, or individuality that
either claims a monopoly over it or in any way claims that right for
itself&rdquo; (SW1, 232). Proyschyn (2014, 397) has suggested
Benjamin&rsquo;s account of the revolutionary general strike is
prescient of post-industrial politics, with the decline of union
militancy and the rise of occupations.</p>

<p>
The afterlives of Benjamin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Critique of Violence&rsquo;
represent attempts to wrestle with the legacy of such a politics,
giving rise to divergent and at times controversial interpretations of
its project. The essay&rsquo;s suggestion that the conference or
parley [<em>Unterredung</em>], which induces individuals or states to
reconcile their interests peacefully without involving the legal
system (SW1, 247), isolates language as pure means wholly inaccessible
to the instrumentality of violence (SW1, 244&ndash;5) has led
J&uuml;rgen Habermas (1979, 59) to insist that the contemporary
relevance of Benjamin&rsquo;s thought lay not in its appeal to another
kind of force but in guiding &ldquo;a theory of linguistic
communication&rdquo; for &ldquo;a materialist theory of social
evolution&rdquo;. Moran and Salzani (2015, 3&ndash;4) have suggested
in turn that the problematic influence of Habermas&rsquo;s article
&ldquo;may have contributed to a kind of non-reading of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay&rdquo; by later generations of critical
theorists.</p>

<p>
One early strand of the reception of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay, promoted
in particular by Giorgio Agamben, sought to situate his political
thought within the context of debates around political theology,
particularly the Catholic-infused political theology of Carl Schmitt.
This reception begins with Agamben&rsquo;s 1970 essay &lsquo;On the
Limits of Violence,&rsquo; which draws on Benjamin alongside
Arendt&rsquo;s <em>The Human Condition</em>. Agamben&rsquo;s essay is
contemporaneous with Arendt&rsquo;s <em>On Violence</em> and a
footnote referencing Agamben&rsquo;s essay was added to the German
edition, but it has become influential via the critique of the
biopolitical &lsquo;state of exception&rsquo; initiated by
Agamben&rsquo;s <em>Homo Sacer</em> (1995, trans. 1998) and <em>State
of Exception</em> (2003, trans. 2005). Agamben&rsquo;s popularization
of an intellectual encounter between Benjamin and Schmitt follows from
the critical recuperation of the latter by the religious philosopher
Jacob Taubes, alongside Taubes&rsquo;s claim that Benjamin&rsquo;s
connection to Judaism can only be understood according to the
political theology of Saint Paul. Despite Agamben&rsquo;s intention to
complete Benjamin&rsquo;s account of &lsquo;divine violence&rsquo; as
a critique of Schmitt&rsquo;s theory of sovereignty &ndash; with the
former, Agamben suggesting, managing to &ldquo;carefully stay a
hair&rsquo;s breadth away from it&rdquo; (Pomreneke 2017) &ndash;
there is little evidence to substantiate such a claim, which involves
a number of chronological reversals (Kostko 2008; Pomreneke 2017) and
overstates (Butler 2006, 206&ndash;7) or misreads Benjamin&rsquo;s
interest in Schmitt (Hamacher 1991, 1149, n.34; Tomba 2009,
131&ndash;132; Averlar 2005, 79&ndash;106; Weber 2008, 176&ndash;194).
In this respect, perhaps, it was not Schmitt&rsquo;s political
theology but the reactionary vitalism of Ludwig Klages that proved a
more influential and enduring object of fascination for Benjamin (Fuld
1981; McCole 1993, 178&ndash;180, 236&ndash;246; Wolin 1994,
xxxi&ndash;xxxviii; Wohlfarth 2002, 65&ndash;109; Lebovic 2013,
1&ndash;10, 79&ndash;110; Charles 2018, 52&ndash;62).</p>

<p>
An alternative reception of Benjamin&rsquo;s essay, reacting to the
concerns raised by these debates (Bredekamp 2016, 695), emphasized the
place of language and sought to reassert the centrality of a Judaic
conception of justice in his political thought, beginning with Jacques
Derrida&rsquo;s deconstruction of law in <em>The Force of Law: the
Mystical Foundation of Authority</em> (1990). Derrida&rsquo;s reading
recalls the &ldquo;moment in which the foundation [or revolutionary
moment] of law remains suspended in the void or over the abyss,
suspended by a pure performative act&hellip; before a law not yet
determined &hellip;a law yet to come&hellip; (in somewhat the same
sense that one speaks of a &lsquo;felicitous performative speech
act&rsquo;)&rdquo; (Derrida 1990, 36). Such a foundation points to how
the series of oppositions Benjamin draws in his essay &ndash;
law-making/law-preserving violence, mythic/divine violence, political
strike/proletarian general strike &ndash; deconstruct themselves
(Derrida 1990, 38), leaving the text unable to &ldquo;escape the law
that it states&rdquo; and a &ldquo;ruined and contaminated
&hellip;.specter of itself&rdquo; (Derrida 1990, 42&ndash;3). Derrida
worries this undecidability in Benjamin&rsquo;s
&lsquo;messianico-Marxist&rsquo; justification of divine violence
could be used to legitimate antiparliamentary sentiments and the
violence of political events such as the Holocaust (although
&ldquo;Derrida gives no supporting evidence for this claim&rdquo;) and
so, against the &ldquo;all-too-strong Messianism&rdquo; of
Benjamin&rsquo;s essay, he recovers a &lsquo;messianicity&rsquo;
&ldquo;weaker even than the &lsquo;weak messianic force&rsquo; of the
[later] &lsquo;Theses&rsquo;&rdquo; (Wohlfarth 2008&ndash;9, 2:15).
Derrida&rsquo;s subsequent <em>Spectres of Marx</em> (1993) extends
this figure of spectrality to the messianicity of Marxism more
generally.</p>

<p>
Against the receptions of Benjamin&rsquo;s politics outlined above,
the messianic would rather appear to point to the &ldquo;irreducible
theological remainder&rdquo; upon which Benjamin&rsquo;s concept of
redemption rests, one that Khatib (2013) argues should not be reduced
to that of Judaeo-Christian theology. The construction of
Benjamin&rsquo;s politics, as it develops from the &lsquo;Critique of
Violence&rsquo; and &lsquo;Capitalism as Religion&rsquo; through
<em>One-Way Street</em> and the <em>Arcades Project</em>, is better
historically contextualized against the totalizing experience of
capitalist modernity. For Benjamin, the religious structure of
capitalism is identified as that of a cult without theology, i.e. one
that &ldquo;makes guilt pervasive&rdquo; (SW1, 289) but offers no
possibility of &ldquo;conversion, purification, and penance&rdquo;
(SW1, 289&ndash;290) and so is &ldquo;<em>sans tr&ecirc;ve et sans
merci</em>&rdquo; [&ldquo;without truce and without mercy&rdquo;:
likely a paraphrase of Baudelaire&rsquo;s description in &lsquo;<em>Le
Cr&eacute;puscule du soir</em>&rsquo; of the criminality of the Paris
night as &ldquo;<em>ni tr&ecirc;ve ni merci</em>&rdquo; but
mistranscribed in GS as &ldquo;<em>r&ecirc;ve</em>&rdquo; and so
mistranslated in SW1 as &ldquo;dream&rdquo;]. The philosophically
conceived relation between theology and politics, for Benjamin, is
that of a destructiveness he names nihilism (GS 2.1:204) and justifies
through a divine force that cannot provide any profane foundation,
certainly not a theocratic one, and can have no claim on domination
(SW1, 227).</p>

<p>
While Benjamin&rsquo;s political thought may be situated in the milieu
of Expressionist Nietzsche-reception (Steiner 2001), including that of
Erich Unger, his &ldquo;definition of politics&rdquo; as &ldquo;the
fulfillment of an unimproved/unelevated humanness [<em>die
Erf&uuml;llung der ungestiegerten Menschhaftigkeit</em>]&rdquo;(SW1,
227; trans. Fenves &amp; Ng 2021, 83) simultaneously barricades itself
against not only any liberal or enlightenment ideal of progress but
also against any Nietzschean-inspired politics of the
<em>&Uuml;bermensch</em>. For Benjamin, Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea of the
<em>&Uuml;bermensch</em> is &ldquo;the first to recognize the religion
of capitalism&hellip;. characterized (even for Nietzsche himself) by
guilt [<em>Schuld</em>] in a religious sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;begin
to bring it to fulfillment [<em>zu erf&uuml;llen</em>]&rdquo; (SW1,
289). But what Nietzsche in <em>Ecco Home</em> calls his
&lsquo;<em>great politics</em>&rsquo; promises such fulfilment only by
transposing &ldquo;the apocalyptic &lsquo;leap&rsquo; [of theology]
&hellip;into an&hellip;explosive and discontinuous elevation
[<em>Steigerung</em>]&rdquo;: &ldquo;a breaking open of the heavens by
an elevated humanness [<em>gesteigerte Menschhaftigkeit</em>]&rdquo;
(SW1, 289; trans amended). In contrast to Nietzsche&rsquo;s own
critique of bourgeois humanism (Charles 2013; Lopez 2022) &ndash; and
in a subversive appropriation of fascism&rsquo;s own antisemitic and
anti-communist pejoratives &ndash; Benjamin in the 1930s emphasizes
the radical potential of the <em>Unmensch</em> (SW2, 447) and of a
&ldquo;new, positive concept of barbarism&rdquo; (SW2, 732),
encapsulated in the figures of Mickey Mouse, Fourier&rsquo;s utopian
fantasies, Scheerbert&rsquo;s intergalactic creatures, and
Klee&rsquo;s monstrous <em>Angelus Novus</em>. Such a
&ldquo;definition of politics&rdquo; continues to inform what Benjamin
later calls &ldquo;the two articles of my
&lsquo;politics&rsquo;&rdquo;, defined in the <em>Arcades Project</em>
as &ldquo;the idea of revolution as an innervation of the technical
organs of the collective&rdquo; and &ldquo;the idea of the
&lsquo;cracking open [<em>Aufknacken</em>] of natural
teleology&rsquo;&rdquo; (AP W7,4). This is an idea of collective
bodily revolution that establishes the terms on which Benjamin
negotiates his relationship to Marxism in the coming years, outlining
the contours of what Adorno will later term his
&ldquo;anthropological&rdquo; &ndash; rather than a reductively
economic or &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; &ndash; materialism.</p>

<p>
The presentation of contemporary capitalism as metropolitan modernity
in <em>One-Way Street</em> also marks the turning point in
Benjamin&rsquo;s writings, away from what he retrospectively called
&ldquo;an archaic form of philosophizing naively caught up in
nature&rdquo; (BA, 88) towards the development of &ldquo;a political
view of the past&rdquo; (SW 2, 210). The theory of experience outlined
in his early writings is enlisted for revolutionary ends. In the
essay, &lsquo;Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European
Intelligentsia&rsquo; (1929), Surrealist experience provides an
example of a &ldquo;profane illumination&rdquo;, which in contrast to
the sacred and moralistic kind found in religion was guided by a
political and a &ldquo;materialistic, anthropological
inspiration&rdquo; (SW 2, 209). The latent energy residing in the most
destitute and outmoded of things is, through the construction of new
political constellations, transformed into an intoxicating,
revolutionary experience (SW 2, 210). The possibility of such a
profane illumination of nineteenth century Paris, to be presented as
the origin of modernity, preoccupied the remaining decade of
Benjamin&rsquo;s life, and his research for the monumental and
unfinished <em>Arcades Project</em> provides the material from which
all his remaining work is constructed.</p>

<h2><a id="ArcPro">6. The Arcades Project</a></h2>

<p>
The city was the seedbed of Benjamin&rsquo;s &lsquo;gothic&rsquo;
Marxism (Cohen 1993); Paris its testing ground. All of
Benjamin&rsquo;s writings from the autumn of 1927 until his death in
1940 relate in one way or other to his great unfinished study
&lsquo;Paris&mdash;Capital of the Nineteenth Century&rsquo;, otherwise
known as <em>The Arcades Project</em> (<em>Das Passagen-Werk</em>),
after its founding image, taken by Benjamin from the 1926 novel,
<em>Le Paysan de Paris</em>, by the French surrealist Louis Aragon.
This was a book of which Benjamin wrote: &ldquo;I could never read
more than two or three pages in bed at night before my heart started
to beat so strongly that I had to lay the book aside.&rdquo; (BA, 88)
The arcades would become just one of five or six archetypal images of
the psychosocial space of 19th-century Paris around which the project
was organized&mdash;each paired with a particular, thematically
representative individual. But it provided the model for the others,
and its surrealist origin and liminal utopian impulse, neither quite
inside nor out, established the wish-image and the
dream-image&mdash;on the threshold of sleeping and waking&mdash;at the
heart of a work that was initially conceived as a kind of
&lsquo;dialectical fairytale&rsquo;. (The figure with whom &lsquo;the
arcades&rsquo; was paired was the utopian socialist Charles Fourier.)
All of Benjamin&rsquo;s major essays of the 1930s derived their
impetus and orientation from his Arcades work, and served to defer its
completion in the act of elaborating its elements.</p>

<p>
This deferral was also, in part, the result of a process of
maturation&mdash;a kind of ripening&mdash;immanent to the work itself.
<em>The Arcades</em> was a vast and ambitious project, not simply in
terms of the mass and breadth of its archival sources (sought out by
Benjamin in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris), but
also&mdash;indeed, primarily&mdash;with respect to its philosophical
and historical intent, and the methodological and representational
challenges it posed. Its sprawling, yet minutely investigated
historical object was to act as the point of entry into the
philosophically comprehended experience of metropolitan
capitalism&mdash;not some past experience, or the experience of a past
phase of capitalist development, but the experience of the capitalist
metropolis in Benjamin&rsquo;s own day&mdash;through the construction
of a specific series of relations between its elements
&lsquo;then&rsquo; and &lsquo;now&rsquo;. The practice of research,
conceptual organization and presentation that it involved was
self-consciously conceived as a working model for a new,
philosophically oriented, materialist historiography with political
intent. Its final, fragmentary and &lsquo;ruined&rsquo; status has
come to stand not simply as the sign of a failure of completion, but
as a paradigm of a form of constitutive incompletion that is
characteristic of all systematically oriented knowledge under the
conditions of modernity. In this respect, in its very failure to be
actualized, it confirmed the fundamental historical and philosophical
truth of Benjamin&rsquo;s earlier analysis of the Romantic
fragment&mdash;extending the genre in a hitherto unimagined way.</p>

<p>
In the ebb and flow of its changing rhythms&mdash;additions,
revisions, reformulations and retrievals&mdash;Benjamin&rsquo;s
<em>Arcades Project</em> provides an extraordinary case study in the
labour of conceptual construction via the configuration and
reconfiguration of archival materials. The voluminous &lsquo;Notes and
Materials&rsquo; that make up the <em>Arcades</em> as it has come down
to us remained unpublished until 1982, finally appearing in English
only in 1999 (GS V; AP). Only since their publication has it been
possible to get a clear sense of the overall trajectory of
Benjamin&rsquo;s thought during this period&mdash;rendering redundant,
or at least displacing, many of the polemics associated with previous
cycles of reception. The notes and materials are organized into
twenty-six alphabetically designated &lsquo;convolutes&rsquo;
(literally &lsquo;bundles&rsquo;) or folders, thematically defined by
various <em>objects</em> (arcades, catacombs, barricades, iron
constructions, mirrors, modes of lighting&hellip;), <em>topics</em>
(fashion, boredom, theory of knowledge, theory of progress, painting,
conspiracies&hellip;), <em>figures</em> (the collector, the flaneur,
the automaton&hellip;), <em>authors</em> (Baudelaire, Fourier, Jung,
Marx, Saint-Simon&hellip;) and their combinations. The project as a
whole received two &lsquo;expos&eacute;s&rsquo; or summaries, in 1935
and 1939 (the second, in French). However, its scope and theoretical
ambition&mdash;nothing less than a philosophical construction of
&ldquo;the primal history of the nineteenth century&rdquo; (BA,
90)&mdash;joined with the circumstances of Benjamin&rsquo;s life in
exile (the constant need to earn money by writing and the uncertainty
of a publisher for the project) to frustrate its realization. The only
lengthy segment of completed text derives from the part devoted to
Baudelaire (one of five parts in the 1939 expos&eacute;, cut down from
six in the initial 1935 version): the second of its three projected
sections, &lsquo;The Paris of the Second Empire in
Baudelaire&rsquo;&mdash;although even this was never published in
Benjamin&rsquo;s lifetime. However, the central chapter of this
section, &lsquo;The Flaneur&rsquo;, was revised and expanded (in part,
in response to an exchange of letters with Adorno) into the essay
&lsquo;Some Motifs in Baudelaire&rsquo;, which was published in the
Institute&rsquo;s journal, <em>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
Sozialforschung</em> (<em>Journal for Social Research</em>) in January
1940. A powerful compressed draft of material corresponding to the
final section, on the commodity as a poetic object, exists as
&lsquo;Central Park&rsquo; (SW 4, 161&ndash;199). As the project
evolved, and in response to the barriers to its realization,
Baudelaire thus became increasingly central to Benjamin&rsquo;s
thinking. (&lsquo;Convolute J&rsquo;, on Baudelaire, is by far the
longest of the convolutes.) Encouraged by Horkheimer, Benjamin planned
to publish the material on Baudelaire as a separate book, to be
entitled, <em>Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High
Capitalism</em>. The development of this process, whereby a primal
history of the nineteenth century gradually morphed into a book on
Baudelaire and &lsquo;high capitalism&rsquo;, may be represented,
diagrammatically, as follows.</p>

<p>
However, to reduce the project to its own, restricted <em>de
facto</em> trajectory, rich as it is, does too much violence to the
historical and philosophical framework it embodies, from which the
material on Baudelaire gains its broader significance. The overarching
historical framework is that of capitalist modernity as a
&lsquo;crisis of experience&rsquo;. (The two terms, capitalism and
modernity, are inextricable for Benjamin in the context of 19th- and
early 20th-century Europe.) The founding problematic of
Benjamin&rsquo;s thought&mdash;the expansion of the Kantian concept of
experience, to infinity&mdash;is thus here provided with a concretely
historical context, in which the notion of infinity/absoluteness
becomes associated with the concept of history itself. The problem: to
dialectically redeem the concept of experience [<em>Erfahrung</em>] by
finding an appropriate way of experiencing the crisis of experience
itself. In classically &lsquo;modern&rsquo; terms, the present is
defined as a time of crisis and transition, and philosophical
experience (truth) is associated with the glimpse within the present,
via the past, of a utopian political future that would bring history
to an end. More immediately, the crisis is given political meaning by
two possible resolutions: the one destructive; the other constructive/
emancipatory&mdash;fascism and communism, respectively. In this
respect, for all his theoretical heterodoxy as a &lsquo;Marxist&rsquo;
and his philosophical affinities with Adorno, Benjamin was in search
of, and in solidarity with, new forms of collectivity connected to a
communist future. Herein lay the basis of his friendship with Brecht.
Unlike Brecht, however, he conceived them within the terms of a
speculative cultural history (Caygill 2004).</p>

<p>
Within this framework, three distinct strands of work (discussed in
the next three sections) can be discerned: (1) investigation of the
crisis of experience via the &lsquo;crisis of the arts&rsquo; (SW 2,
212) through the interrelated terms of <em>technology/technique</em>
[<em>Technik</em>], <em>aura</em>, <em>reproducibility</em>, and
<em>collectivity</em>; (2) philosophical distillation of the formal
structure of the experience of the new, and its historical and
political contradictions, out of its social forms, and the examination
of its relations to allegory and commodity-form; (3) construction of a
new historiography and a new philosophical concept of history. The
first may be traced through a linked series of essays of which
&lsquo;Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European
Intelligentsia&rsquo; (1929), &lsquo;Little History of
Photography&rsquo; (1931), &lsquo;The Work of Art in the Age of its
Technical Reproducibility&rsquo; (1935&ndash;9) and &lsquo;The
Storyteller&rsquo; (1936) are the most important. The second is
concentrated in readings of Baudelaire and related texts by Nietzsche
and Blanqui. (The focusing-in on these three thinkers is a focusing-in
on the relationship of capitalism to modernity in its purest,
nihilistic form). The third is conjured from a reflective conjunction
of Marx, Nietzsche and Surrealism. It takes methodological form in
&lsquo;Convolute N [On the Theory of Knowledge, Theory of
Progress]&rsquo; in <em>The Arcades Project</em> and achieved its
accidentally definitive presentation in Benjamin&rsquo;s most
frequently cited, but still fiercely interpretatively disputed text
(Caygill 2004; L&ouml;wy 2005; Tiedemman 1989; Wohlfarth 1978): the
fragments&mdash;known as theses&mdash;&lsquo;On the Concept of
History&rsquo;.</p>

<h2><a id="ArtTec">7. Art and Technology</a></h2>

<p>
That Benjamin approached the symptomatic significance of the
&lsquo;crisis of the arts&rsquo; for the &lsquo;crisis of
experience&rsquo; through the concept of <em>Technik</em> attests to
the fundamentally Marxist character of his conception of historical
development. It is the development of the forces of production that is
the motor of history. However, Benjamin was no more orthodox a Marxist
about technology than he was with regard to the concept of progress,
the Marxist version of which the German Social Democratic Party (SPD)
grounded upon it (see Section 8, below). Not only did he recognize the
potential for a &ldquo;bloodbath&rdquo; in a technology subjected to
&ldquo;the lust for profit&rdquo; (SW 1, 487)&mdash;amply demonstrated
in the horrors of the First World War&mdash;but he came to distinguish
between a &lsquo;first&rsquo; and a &lsquo;second&rsquo;, potentially
liberatory technology, the latter making possible &ldquo;a highly
productive use of the human being&rsquo;s self-alienation&rdquo; (SW
3, 107; 113). It appears, in places, as the basis for a kind of
&lsquo;technological cosmopolitics&rsquo; or politics of a &lsquo;new
collective technoid body&rsquo; (Caygill 2005, 225; Leslie 2000, 153,
in Osborne 2005, II: 391).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The mastery of nature, so the imperialists teach, is the purpose of
all technology [<em>Technik</em>]. But &hellip;technology is not the
mastery of nature but of the relation between nature and humanity.
&hellip;In technology a <em>physis</em> is being organized through
which mankind&rsquo;s contact with the cosmos takes a new and
different form from that which it had in nations
[<em>V&ouml;lkern</em>] and families. (SW 1, 487, translation
amended)</p>

<p>
The collective is a body, too. And the <em>physis</em> that is being
organized for it in technology can, through all its political and
factual reality, only be produced in that image sphere to which
profane illumination initiates us. Only when in technology body and
image so interpenetrate that all revolutionary tension becomes bodily
collective innervation, and all the bodily innervations of the
collective become revolutionary discharge, has reality transcended
itself to the extent demanded by the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>. (SW
2, 217&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These passages, from the concluding sections of <em>One-Way
Street</em> and the &lsquo;Surrealism&rsquo; essay, respectively,
convey something of the ecstatic character of Benjamin&rsquo;s
political thought at the outset of the 1930s, in which technology
appears on a political knife-edge between its possibilities as
&ldquo;a fetish of doom&rdquo; and &ldquo;a key to happiness&rdquo;
(SW 2, 321). Art&mdash;an art of the masses&mdash;appears within this
scenario as the educative mechanism through which the body of the
collective can begin to appropriate its own technological
potential.</p>

<blockquote>
The first technology really sought to master nature, whereas the
second aims rather at an interplay between nature and humanity. The
primary social function of art today is to rehearse that interplay.
This applies especially to film. <em>The function of film is to train
human beings in the apperception and reactions needed to deal with a
vast apparatus whose role in their lives is expanding almost
daily</em>. Dealing with this apparatus also teaches them that
technology will release them from their enslavement to the powers of
the apparatus only when humanity&rsquo;s whole constitution has
adapted itself to the new productive forces which the second
technology has set free. (SW 3, 107&ndash;8)
</blockquote>

<p>
In his footnote to this passage from the second version of &lsquo;The
Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility&rsquo;
(&lsquo;<em>Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen
Reproduzierbarkeit</em>&rsquo;, 1936), Benjamin refers us to the
&lsquo;phalansteries&rsquo;, the &ldquo;self-contained agrarian
collectives&rdquo; of Fourier&rsquo;s socialist utopia. In the Fourier
convolute of the <em>Arcades Project</em>, these are compared to the
two main articles of Benjamin&rsquo;s politics: &ldquo;the idea of
revolution as an innervation of the technical organs of the
collective&hellip; and the idea of the &lsquo;cracking open of natural
teleology&rsquo;&rdquo; (AP, [W7, 4], 631). For Benjamin, art, in the
form of film&mdash;the &ldquo;unfolding &lt;result&gt; of all the
forms of perception, the tempos and rhythms, which lie preformed in
today&rsquo;s machines&rdquo;&mdash;thus harboured the possibility of
becoming a kind of rehearsal of the revolution. &ldquo;[A]ll problems
of contemporary art&rdquo;, Benjamin insisted, &ldquo;find their
definitive formulation only in the context of film&rdquo; (AP, [K3,
3], 394). In this respect, it was the combination of the communist
pedagogy and constructive devices of Brecht&rsquo;s epic theatre that
marked it out for him as a theatre for the age of film (UB,
1&ndash;25; Wizisla 2009).</p>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s writings on film are justly renowned for their twin
theses of the transformation of the concept of art by its
&lsquo;technical reproducibility&rsquo; and the new possibilities for
collective experience this contains, in the wake of the historical
decline of the &lsquo;aura&rsquo; of the work of art, a process that
film is presented as definitively concluding. Much ink has been spilt
debating the thesis of the decline of the aura in Benjamin&rsquo;s
work. On the one hand, with regard to some of his writings,
Benjamin&rsquo;s concept of aura has been accused of fostering a
nostalgic, purely negative sense of modernity as loss&mdash;loss of
unity both with nature and in community (A. Benjamin 1989). On the
other hand, in the work on film, Benjamin appears to adopt an
affirmative technological modernism, which celebrates the consequences
of the decline. Adorno, for one, felt betrayed by the latter position.
He wrote to Benjamin on 18 March 1936:</p>

<blockquote>
In your earlier writings&hellip; you distinguished the idea of the
work of art as a structure from the symbol of theology on the one
hand, and from the taboo of magic on the other. I now find it somewhat
disturbing &mdash;and here I can see a sublimated remnant of certain
Brechtian themes&mdash;that you have now rather casually transferred
the concept of the magical aura to the &lsquo;autonomous work of
work&rsquo; and flatly assigned a counter-revolutionary function to
the latter. (BA, 128)
</blockquote>

<p>
Brecht himself, meanwhile, was appalled by even the residually
negative function of the aura, recording his response in his
<em>Workbook</em>: &ldquo;it is all mysticism mysticism, in a posture
opposed to mysticism. &hellip; it is rather ghastly&rdquo; (cited in
Buck-Morss 1977, 149). Yet Adorno did not defend &lsquo;auratic
art&rsquo; as such. (His defence of autonomous art was grounded on the
experience derived from following the &lsquo;autonomous&rsquo;
technical development of laws of form.)</p>

<p>
Clearly, the concept of the aura plays a number of different roles in
Benjamin&rsquo;s writings, in his various attempts to grasp his
historical present in terms of the possibilities for
&lsquo;experience&rsquo; afforded by its new cultural forms; which he
increasingly came to identify (some say precipitously) with
revolutionary political potential. Yet Adorno was wrong to see a
simple change of position, rather than a complex series of inflections
of what was a generally consistent historical account. Benjamin had
written affirmatively of &ldquo;the emancipation of object from
aura&rdquo; as early as 1931, in his &lsquo;Little History of
Photography&rsquo;, in which he described Atget&rsquo;s photographs as
&ldquo;suck[ing] the aura out of reality like water from a sinking
ship&rdquo; (SW 2, 518). It is here that we find the basic definition
of aura: &ldquo;A strange weave of space and time: the unique
appearance or semblance of distance, no matter how close it may
be.&rdquo; Importantly, the examples given with this definition are
from nature: mountains and a branch observed &ldquo;at rest on a
summer&rsquo;s noon &hellip; until the moment or the hour become part
of their appearance&hellip;&rdquo;. The &lsquo;destruction&rsquo; of
the aura by transience and reproducibility is judged &ldquo;a salutary
estrangement&rdquo; (SW 2, 518&ndash;9). Similarly, when &lsquo;The
Storyteller&rsquo; recounts the &ldquo;dying out of the art of
storytelling&rdquo; and &ldquo;the incomparable aura that surrounds
the storyteller&rdquo;, it is nonetheless maintained: &ldquo;nothing
could be more fatuous than to wish to see it as merely a
&lsquo;symptom of decay&rsquo;, let alone a &lsquo;modern
symptom&rsquo;. It is rather, only a concomitant of the secular
productive forces of history&hellip;&rdquo; (SW 3, 146; 162).
&lsquo;The Work of Art&rsquo; essay extends and enriches the earlier
account of photography&rsquo;s technological transformation of
perception (&ldquo;the optical unconscious&rdquo;) with reference to
film. The difference resides in the insistent political dimension of
the later essay (after Hitler&rsquo;s taking of power in 1933), and
its determination to introduce concepts &ldquo;that are completely
useless for the purposes of fascism&rdquo; (SW 3, 102). The main
problem with the auratic (which is deemed historically residual, not
eliminated, indeed is perhaps ineliminable [Didi-Huberman 2004]) was
that, Benjamin believed, it was precisely &ldquo;useful for
fascism&rdquo;. This context over-determines the essay throughout,
with its almost Manichean oppositions between ritual and politics,
cult value and exhibition value. Quite apart from the intervening
technological and social developments, it makes it a very difficult
text simply to &lsquo;use&rsquo; today. For some, however, it is
precisely the connection it draws between a certain kind of mass
culture and fascism that provides its continuing relevance (Buck-Morss
1992).</p>

<h2><a id="BauMod">8. Baudelaire and the Modern</a></h2>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s thinking of &lsquo;the modern&rsquo; [<em>die
Moderne</em>] is his most important theoretical contribution to the
historical study of cultural forms. Frequently mistranslated in early
English-language editions of his writings as &lsquo;modernism&rsquo;,
and still often rendered as &lsquo;modernity&rsquo; (although Benjamin
tended to retain Baudelaire&rsquo;s coinage, <em>la
modernit&eacute;</em>, when making that reference), <em>die
Moderne</em> designates both a formal temporal structure and the
diverse range of its historical instances&mdash;past and present.
Baudelaire is the main writer through whom Benjamin thought &lsquo;the
modern&rsquo;; not as might be expected, with reference to the
canonical account of <em>modernit&eacute;</em> in &lsquo;The Painter
of Modern Life&rsquo; (1859/60), but with regard to what Benjamin
called the &lsquo;theory&rsquo; of the modern first set down in
&lsquo;The Salon of 1845&rsquo;: &ldquo;the advent of the true <em>new
(die Heraufkunft des wahrhaft</em> Neunen)&rdquo; (SW 4, 45&ndash;6,
translation amended; GS 1.2, 580).</p>

<p>
In Baudelaire&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Painter&rsquo; essay,
<em>modernit&eacute;</em> famously denotes &lsquo;the ephemeral, the
fugitive, the contingent&rsquo;. It is associated with transitoriness
as the generalized social instantiation of the temporality of the
modern, in the capitalist metropolis. In contrast to transitoriness as
such, however, Benjamin was first and foremost (politically and
philosophically) interested in &lsquo;the new&rsquo;, in its
&lsquo;advent&rsquo; or historical becoming, and in its quality as
newness or novelty (the newness of the new), in a way that was
conceptually distinct from the conventional opposition of the
&lsquo;modern&rsquo; to the &lsquo;ancient&rsquo;&mdash;which
Baudelaire notoriously retained. As a result, Benjamin was
consequently also interested in what the German sociologist Max Weber
would have called its &lsquo;routinization&rsquo; (although Benjamin
did not use this vocabulary): the routinization accompanying the
generalization of the new as a mode of experience&mdash;in fashion and
boredom, in particular&mdash;and the formal structure of sameness
involved in its repetition. It is here that transitoriness enters the
picture&mdash;as a result of the generalization of novelty. Baudelaire
self-consciously embraced modernity with &lsquo;heroic effort&rsquo;,
attempting, like the painter of modern life, to &lsquo;extract its
epic aspects&rsquo; and &lsquo;distill the eternal from the
transitory&rsquo;; Benjamin, on the other hand, sought to understand
it in order to find a way out of what he called its
&lsquo;hell&rsquo;. He picked up on the relationship of the transitory
to the eternal in Baudelaire&rsquo;s account of modernity, but first,
he de-classicized the notion of the &lsquo;eternal&rsquo;, refiguring
it philosophically, and second, he rendered the relationship itself
strictly dialectical: in the modern, it is transitoriness itself that
is eternalized.</p>

<p>
Thus, Benjamin did not so much take over and update Baudelaire&rsquo;s
portrayal of modernity as read it &lsquo;symptomatically&rsquo; (in
Louis Althusser&rsquo;s sense), or more precisely, allegorically, in
order to uncover beneath it the experience of <em>the transformation
of historical time by the commodity form</em>. Baudelaire was able to
grasp this experience, according to Benjamin, through the
contradictory historical temporality that structured his work: at once
resolutely modern yet, in its poetic form (lyric), already
anachronistic. Benjamin similarly valued the disjunctive historical
temporality of Kafka&rsquo;s fables: their status as parables after
the &lsquo;end of storytelling&rsquo;. But whereas Kafka was for
Benjamin &ldquo;the figure of a failure&rdquo; (BS, 226)&mdash;the
inevitable failure of an attempt to translate the experience
[<em>Erlebnis</em>] of modernity into the language of tradition
(Judaism)&mdash;Baudelaire&rsquo;s poetry was able to convey the
intensity of the experience of modernity through the very tension
between that experience and his chosen, lyrical means; not merely
negatively (like Kafka), but via the way in which modernity
transformed those means. In particular, the lyric allowed Baudelaire
to register the full effect of the temporality of the modern on the
dissolution of subjectivity, and the fact that it consequently
&ldquo;takes a heroic constitution to live the modern [<em>die
Moderne</em>]&rdquo; (SW 4, 44, translation amended; GS 1.2, 577). The
extraction of the metropolitan &lsquo;motifs&rsquo; for which
Benjamin&rsquo;s reading of Baudelaire is justly famous&mdash;the
bohemian, the flaneur, the prostitute, the gambler, the
ragpicker&mdash;are the figures via which this structure of experience
appears. Primary within Baudelaire, they are nonetheless
methodologically secondary for Benjamin, as he explained to Adorno:
&ldquo;I only have to insert [them] in the appropriate place&rdquo;
(BA, 90). Baudelaire had found a method&mdash;what he called
&lsquo;correspondences&rsquo;&mdash;which reflectively incorporated
the anachronism of the lyric form into his work. Benjamin appropriated
this method, with its dissociated &lsquo;ritual elements&rsquo; (SW 4,
333), to read Baudelaire himself. In the essay &lsquo;Some Motifs in
Baudelaire&rsquo;, correspondences of temporal structure, experienced
as &lsquo;shock&rsquo;, link the machine, the film, the crowd, and the
game of chance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What determines the rhythm of production on a conveyor belt is the
same thing that underlies the rhythm of reception in the film.
&hellip; The shock experience [<em>Chockerlebnis</em>] which the
passer-by has in the crowd corresponds to the isolated
&lsquo;experiences&rsquo; of the worker at his machine. &hellip; The
jolt in the movement of a machine is like the so-called coup in a game
of chance&hellip;. (SW 4, 328&ndash;30)</p>

<p>
A single repetitive and dissociated formal temporal structure is
detected beneath the rich array of phenomenological forms presented in
Baudelaire&rsquo;s poetry: &ldquo;the price for which the sensation of
the modern could be had: the disintegration of the aura in shock
experience&rdquo;. (SW 4, 343, translation amended; GS 1.2, 653)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Furthermore, this interpretative key, the experience of shock, is
itself understood through a series of theoretical correspondences
within Benjamin&rsquo;s own present; primarily, that between
Proust&rsquo;s &lsquo;involuntary memory&rsquo; and Freud&rsquo;s
theory of consciousness. This theoretical correspondence is read in
the light of the &lsquo;shell shock&rsquo; first diagnosed during the
First World War, about which Benjamin had previously written in his
reflections on Ernst Junger in his 1930 review essay, &lsquo;Theories
of German Fascism&rsquo; (SW 2, 312&ndash;321). The connection of the
modern to fascism does not appear solely through the thematic of the
false restoration of the aura, but also within the process of its
disintegration by shock. (Structurally, the shock of the crowd is
&lsquo;like&rsquo; shell shock.) Baudelaire is thus not merely the
privileged writer for the advent of the theory of the modern, but the
one in whose work the nineteenth century appears most clearly as the
fore-life of the present. However, if it was through Baudelaire that
Benjamin grasped the structure of the temporality of the
&lsquo;modern&rsquo;, it was through Nietzsche and Blanqui that he
explored its ambiguous historical meaning, via the way in which their
philosophies reflect the transformation of the new by the commodity
into the &lsquo;ever selfsame&rsquo;. &ldquo;Just as in the
seventeenth century it is allegory that becomes the canon of
dialectical images, in the nineteenth century it is novelty&rdquo;
(AP, 11): &ldquo;The commodity has taken the place of the allegorical
mode of apprehension.&rdquo; (SW 4, 188)</p>

<p>
It is the fragment &lsquo;Central Park&rsquo; that most clearly
reveals the consequences of Benjamin&rsquo;s reading of Baudelaire for
his concept of history: the modern completely transforms the
possibilities for the experience of history. On the one hand, it
de-historicizes experience, wresting it away from the temporal
continuities of tradition. On the other hand, a messianic
structure&mdash;an opening of history to something outside of
time&mdash;reasserts itself within the still life [<em>nature
mort</em>] of modernity&rsquo;s restless sameness. This is
Benjamin&rsquo;s famous &lsquo;dialectics at a standstill&rsquo;
(Tiedemann, 1982). It transforms the historical naturalism of the
baroque, analyzed in the <em>Origin of the German Mourning-Play</em>
(Section 4, above), in a futural direction. In particular, it involves
a prioritization of the interruptive stasis of the image over the
continuity of temporal succession. In fact, Benjamin maintained:
&ldquo;The concept of historical time forms an antithesis to the idea
of a temporal continuum&rdquo; (SW 4, 407).]</p>

<h2><a id="ImaHisCul">9. Image, History, Culture</a></h2>

<p>
Debate over Benjamin&rsquo;s conception of history was for many years
preoccupied with the question of whether it is essentially
&lsquo;theological&rsquo; or &lsquo;materialist&rsquo; in character
(or how it could possibly be both at once), occasioned by the
conjunction of Benjamin&rsquo;s self-identification with historical
materialism and his continued use of explicitly messianic motifs
(Wolhfarth 1978; Tiedemann 1983&ndash;4). This was in large part the
polemical legacy of the competing influence of three
friendships&mdash;with Gershom Scholem, Theodor W. Adorno and Bertolt
Brecht&mdash;applied to the interpretation of Benjamin&rsquo;s final
text, the fragments &lsquo;On the Concept of History&rsquo;
(&lsquo;<em>&Uuml;ber den Begriff der Geschichte</em>&rsquo;,
popularly known as the &lsquo;Theses on the Philosophy of
History&rsquo;). Scholem promoted a theological interpretation, Brecht
inspired a materialist one, while Adorno attempted to forge some form
of compatibility between the two. Yet the question is badly posed if
it is framed within received concepts of &lsquo;theology&rsquo; and
&lsquo;materialism&rsquo; (the paradox becomes self-sustaining), since
it was Benjamin&rsquo;s aim radically to rethink the meaning of these
ideas, on the basis of a new philosophy of historical time. This new
philosophy of historical time is the ultimate goal of Benjamin&rsquo;s
later writings. It appears most explicitly, under construction, in
&lsquo;Convolute N&rsquo; of <em>The Arcades Project</em>, &lsquo;On
the Theory of Knowledge, Theory of Progress&rsquo;; it is applied to
art history in the 1937 essay &lsquo;Eduard Fuch, Collector and
Historian&rsquo;; and is manifest in a condensed, rhetorically
political and problematic form in &lsquo;On the Concept of
History&rsquo;. It derives from a dual critique of the &lsquo;vulgar
naturalism&rsquo; of <em>historicism</em> and the deferral of action
involved in the associated Social Democratic concept of
<em>progress</em> (Kittsteiner 1986). It gives rise to a conception of
historical intelligibility based on &lsquo;literary montage&rsquo; as
the method of construction of &lsquo;dialectical images&rsquo; (AP,
460&ndash;1). And it culminates in a quasi-messianic conception of
revolution as an &lsquo;interruption&rsquo; of history or an
&lsquo;arrest of happening&rsquo;: &ldquo;Classless society is not the
final goal of historical progress but its frequently miscarried,
ultimately achieved interruption&rdquo; (SW 4, 402).</p>

<p>
Benjamin took as one of the main &lsquo;methodological
objectives&rsquo; of his <em>Arcades Project</em> &ldquo;to
demonstrate a historical materialism which has annihilated within
itself the idea of progress&rdquo;, taking as its &ldquo;founding
concept&hellip; not progress but actualization&rdquo; (AP, [N2, 2],
460). He had both philosophical and political reasons for this.
Philosophically, Benjamin saw the conventional idea of progress as
projecting into the future a conception of time as
&lsquo;homogenous&rsquo; and &lsquo;empty&rsquo; epitomized by the
attempt of Ranke&rsquo;s historicism to represent the past &ldquo;the
way it really was&rdquo; (SW4, 395; 391). This is a conception of time
based on the temporal continuity of past, present and future,
&lsquo;in&rsquo; which events occur and are understood as causally
connected. It is naturalistic in so far as it acknowledges no
fundamental temporal-ontological distinction between past, present and
future time; it has no sense of time as the ongoing production of
temporal differentiation. Time is differentiated solely by the
differences between the events that occur within it. In particular, it
fails to grasp that historical time (the time of human life) is
constituted through such immanent differentiations, via the
existential modes of memory, expectation and action. In this respect,
there are affinities between Benjamin&rsquo;s philosophy of time and
Heidegger&rsquo;s (Caygill, 1994).</p>

<p>
The political consequence of the temporal naturalism underlying the
idea of &lsquo;progress&rsquo; is conformism. For Benjamin,
paradoxically, this applied in particular to the German Social
Democrats&rsquo; understanding of communism as an <em>ideal</em>, in
the neo-Kantian ethical sense of the object of an &lsquo;endless
task&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
Once the classless society had been defined as an infinite task, the
empty homogeneous time was transformed into an anteroom, so to speak,
in which one could wait for the emergence of the revolutionary
situation with more or less equanimity. (SW 4, 402)
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, the concept of progress is demobilizing; and Marxism
had become infected by the ideology of progress. However, rather than
positing an existential alternative, in the manner of
Heidegger&rsquo;s &lsquo;resolute decision&rsquo;, Benjamin set out to
construct novel conceptions of historical time and historical
intelligibility based on the relationship, not between the past and
the present, but between the &lsquo;then&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;now&rsquo;, as brought together in images of the past. Each
historically specific &lsquo;now&rsquo; was understood to correspond
to (in a Baudelairean sense), or to render legible, a particular
&lsquo;then&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or
what is present its light on what is past; rather, an image is that
wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a
constellation. In other words: image is dialectics at a standstill.
For while the relation of the present to the past is purely temporal,
the relation of what-has-been to the now is dialectical: not temporal
in nature but figural [<em>bildlich</em>]. Only dialectical images are
genuinely historical &hellip; (AP, [N3, 1], 463)
</blockquote>

<p>
The experimental method of montage, borrowed from surrealism, was to
be the means of production of historical intelligibility. Furthermore,
the &lsquo;static&rsquo; temporality of the image was understood to
connect such an experience of historical meaning, directly, to a
radical or &lsquo;revolutionary&rsquo; concept of action, associated
with the idea of the present as crisis. The passage above
continues:</p>

<blockquote>
The image that is read&mdash;which is to say, the image in the now of
its recognizability [<em>das Bild im Jetzt der
Erkennbarkeik</em>]&mdash;bears to the highest degree the imprint of
the perilous critical moment on which all reading is founded. (AP,
[N3, 1], 463)
</blockquote>

<p>
Such &ldquo;perilous critical moments&rdquo; are both immanent to the
temporality of modernity, at a structural level (the temporality of
crisis), and, in each particular case, contingent and conjuncturally
specific. In them, the past is understood &ldquo;to bring the present
into a critical state&rdquo;. However, this critical state is not a
crisis of the status quo, but rather of its destruction: the critical
moment is that in which &ldquo;the status quo threatens to be
preserved&rdquo; (AP, [N10, 2], 474). Dialectical images counter the
threat of preservation (tradition) by virtue of the interruptive force
they are understood to impart to experience as a consequence of the
instantaneous temporality of the now, or what Benjamin famously called
now-time [<em>Jetztzeit</em>]: &ldquo;The dialectical image is an
image that emerges suddenly, in a flash&rdquo; (AP, [N9, 7], 473). It
is this image of the image as a &lsquo;flash&rsquo; [<em>ein
aufblitzendes</em>] and the corresponding image of historical
experience as the discharge of an explosive force&mdash;the explosive
force of now-time, blasting open &lsquo;the continuum of
history&rsquo;&mdash;for which Benjamin is probably best known. The
philosophy of historical time which these images sum up was elaborated
by him in two main contexts: the development of a new conception of
cultural history and a political diagnosis of the historical crisis of
Europe at the outset of the Second World War.</p>

<p>
Benjamin did not see culture as threatened by &lsquo;barbarism&rsquo;,
so much as itself being implicated in it:</p>

<blockquote>
Barbarism lurks in the very concept of culture&mdash;as the concept of
a fund of values which is considered independent not, indeed, of the
production process in which these values originated, but of the one in
which they survive. In this way they serve the apotheosis of the
latter, barbaric as it may be. (AP, [N5a, 7] 467&ndash;8)
</blockquote>

<p>
The concept of culture as the values of a heritage was for Benjamin
&lsquo;fetishistic&rsquo;: &ldquo;Culture appears reified.&rdquo; Only
an understanding of &ldquo;the crucial importance of reception&hellip;
enables us to correct the process of reification which takes place in
a work of art&rdquo; (SW 3, 267; 269). For Benjamin, however,
reception&mdash;or what he called the &lsquo;afterlife&rsquo;
[<em>Nachleben</em>] of the work&mdash;was not merely something that
happened to the work, externally; it was as <em>constitutive</em> of
the work itself as its &lsquo;fore-life&rsquo; [<em>Vorleben</em>], or
conditions of production&mdash;which are themselves rendered invisible
by the idea of culture as value, and are themselves &ldquo;involved in
a constant process of change&rdquo; as the work itself changes. A
materialist cultural history would restore to the experience of works
a sense of both of these changing sets of conditions (before and
after), and the conflicts between them, in an engagement
&ldquo;originary for every present&rdquo;, since &ldquo;[i]t is the
present that polarizes the event into fore- and after-history&rdquo;
(SW 3, 261&ndash;2; AP, [N7a, 8], 471). It is here, in an ontological
rethinking of reception, that the philosophical significance of
Benjamin&rsquo;s interest in technologies of reproduction lies. With
these concepts of fore- and afterlife, Benjamin founded a new
problematic for cultural study.</p>

<p>
Benjamin was interested in &lsquo;culture&rsquo; not as an autonomous
realm of values (&ldquo;the independent values of aesthetic,
scientific, ethical&hellip; and even religious achievements&rdquo;),
but on the contrary, like the sociologist Georg Simmel, whose
<em>Philosophy of Money</em> he cities in this regard, as
&ldquo;elements in the development of human nature&rdquo; (Simmel,
quoted in AP, [N14, 3], 480). In this respect, cultural study is
situated within the field of a materialist philosophy of history. And
the philosophy of history insists on a conception of history as a
whole. It is here than the messianic structure of Benajmin&rsquo;s
concept of history confronts us as unavoidable; although not thereby
necessarily &lsquo;theological&rsquo;, since it is the transition of a
conceptual structure from one philosophical context into another that
is at issue (Benjamin&rsquo;s favorite surrealist method of
&lsquo;decontextualization&rsquo; and
&lsquo;defamiliarization&rsquo;), not its meaning in its original
theological context as such. In his search for a non-Hegelian,
non-developmentalist conception of history as a whole, in &lsquo;On
the Concept of History&rsquo; Benjamin figured now-time,
quasi-messianically, alternatively as a &lsquo;model&rsquo; of
messianic time and as &ldquo;shot through with splinters of messianic
time.&rdquo; In the context of a diagnosis of the European crisis of
1939&ndash;40 as a world-historical crisis, the &lsquo;critical state
of the present&rsquo; thus came, in this text, to acquire a
theological-political tenor. &ldquo;A revolutionary chance in the
fight for the oppressed past&rdquo; is compared to &ldquo;the sign of
a messianic arrest of happening&rdquo; (SW 4, 396&ndash;7). Benjamin
was aware that this rhetoric would lead to misunderstanding. But the
combination of perceived political urgency and isolation compelled him
to extend his concept of history beyond the state of his philosophical
research, experimentally, into an apparently definitive statement. It
is as if Benjamin had hoped to overcome the aporia of action within
his still essentially hermeneutical philosophy (Osborne 1995) through
the force of language alone. Formally, however, &lsquo;On the Concept
of History&rsquo; should be read as a series of fragments, in the
early Romantic sense. As such, it remains resolutely
negative&mdash;and thereby importantly partial&mdash;in its evocation
of the historical whole, which is acknowledged as unpresentable. In
this respect, Benjamin&rsquo;s final text recalls his earliest major
publication, the 1919 thesis &lsquo;The Concept of Art Criticism in
German Romanticism&rsquo;: as a gesture towards the philosophy of
history needed to complete a modified and &lsquo;modernized&rsquo;
version of the early Romantic project.</p>
