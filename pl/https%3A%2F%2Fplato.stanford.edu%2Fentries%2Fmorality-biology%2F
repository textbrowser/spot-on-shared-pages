<h1>Morality and Evolutionary Biology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Dec 19, 2008; substantive revision Tue Jul 15, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
An article in <em>The Economist</em> (21 February 2008, &ldquo;Moral
thinking&rdquo;), sporting the provocative subtitle &ldquo;Biology
Invades a Field Philosophers Thought was Safely Theirs,&rdquo; begins
by asking:</p>

<blockquote>
Whence morality? That is a question which has troubled philosophers
since their subject was invented. Two and a half millennia of debate
have, however, failed to produce a satisfactory answer. So now it is
time for someone else to have a
 go.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 </blockquote>

<p>
The article closes by suggesting that &ldquo;perhaps [biologists] can
eventually do what philosophers have never managed, and explain moral
behavior in an intellectually satisfying way.&rdquo; These passages
epitomize a growing theme in popular media, echoing claims made forty
years ago with the emergence of <em>sociobiology</em>, when E.O.
Wilson suggested that &ldquo;the time has come for ethics to be
removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers and
biologicized&rdquo; (Wilson 1975, 562). For their part, moral
philosophers will hasten to point out that they are not primarily in
the business of &ldquo;explaining moral behavior&rdquo; in the sense
of causally explaining the origins of our capacity for moral judgment
or of various associated emotional and behavioral dispositions. If a
moral philosopher asks &ldquo;whence morality,&rdquo; she is more
likely to be concerned with the justification of moral principles or
the source and nature of obligation. Still, there are important
connections between the scientific explanatory issues and
philosophical ones, opening the way for profitable interdisciplinary
inquiry.</p>

<p>
Section 1 provides an overview of the issues and some of the relations
between them, highlighting important distinctions we will need
throughout. Sections 2, 3 and 4 then go on to explore critically the
three main branches of inquiry at the intersection of morality and
evolutionary biology: Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Prescriptive
Evolutionary Ethics, and Evolutionary Metaethics.</p>

<h2><a name="OveBasIssQueDis">1. Overview: Basic Issues, Questions, and Distinctions</a></h2>

<p>
Very little in the study of human life has been left untouched by
developments in evolutionary biology, and inquiry into the nature of
morality is no exception. With the recognition that we, like all other
creatures, belong to a species that has evolved through natural
selection comes the acknowledgement that evolutionary processes have
likewise shaped us deeply. How deeply?</p>

<p>
Evolutionary explanations are commonplace when it comes to human
physiology&mdash;why we have opposable thumbs, say, or a bipedal
posture. But even a brief look at other animals affords countless
examples of adaptive <em>psychological</em> and <em>behavioral</em>
traits as well. Consider appetites for food or sex, fear responses,
patterns of aggression, parental care and bonding, or patterns of
cooperation and retribution: these traits are likewise often best
explained as biological adaptations, i.e., traits that evolved through
natural selection due to their adaptive effects. This raises the
question: to what extent might human psychological and behavioral
traits similarly reflect our own evolutionary heritage?</p>

<p>
When it comes to morality, the most basic issue concerns our
<em>capacity for normative guidance</em>: our ability to be motivated
by norms of behavior and feeling through <em>judgments</em> about how
people <em>ought</em> to act (Joyce 2006, Kitcher 2006a,b, 2011, and
Machery and Mallon 2010). Is this human capacity a biological
adaptation, having conferred a selective advantage on our hominin
ancestors by enhancing social cohesion and cooperation?
(&lsquo;Hominin&rsquo; refers, as did &lsquo;hominid&rsquo; until very
recently, to <em>Homo sapiens</em> together with fossil species of ape
to which <em>Homo sapiens</em> are more closely related than we are to
chimpanzees; these include the Australopithecines, extinct species of
<em>Homo</em>, etc., making up the tribe Hominini within the
sub-family Homininae.)</p>

<p>
If so, then it would be part of <em>evolved</em> <em>human nature</em>
to employ moral judgment in governing human behavior, rather than a
mere &ldquo;cultural veneer&rdquo; artificially imposed on an amoral
human nature (de Waal 2004). This would be a significant result, and
it is only the beginning of the intriguing questions that arise at the
intersection of morality and evolutionary biology. We might also
wonder about more specific forms of evolutionary influence. Are there,
for example, emotional adaptations that influence the very
<em>content</em> of moral judgments and behavior, even today?</p>

<p>
For example, many of us believe that we have special, particularly
stringent moral duties toward family members. Might this &lsquo;moral
intuition&rsquo; be attributable, at least in part, to an evolved
tendency to favor members of one&rsquo;s kin group over others,
analogous to similar traits in other animals? Even where moral beliefs
are heavily shaped by culture, there might be such evolutionary
influences in the background: evolved psychological traits may have
contributed to the shaping of cultural practices themselves,
influencing the development of &ldquo;family first&rdquo; cultural
norms that inform our judgments. Similarly with a tendency more
generally to favor members of one&rsquo;s own group (however defined)
over outsiders.</p>

<p>
The above sorts of questions, which have been receiving growing
attention in the sciences, all pertain to morality understood as a
<em>set of empirical phenomena to be explained</em>: it is an
empirical fact about human beings that we make moral judgments, have
certain feelings and behave in certain ways, and it is natural for the
sciences to seek causal explanations for such phenomena. At the same
time, however, it is a very complex matter&mdash;and one often
neglected outside of philosophy&mdash;how such empirical, explanatory
projects are related to the very different sets of questions and
projects pursued by philosophers when they inquire into the nature and
source of morality.</p>

<p>
Moral philosophers tend to focus on questions about the justification
of moral claims, the existence and grounds of moral truths, and what
morality requires of us (in the sense of what is necessary for us to
live morally good lives). These are very different from the empirical
questions pursued in the sciences, but how we answer each set of
questions may have implications for how we should answer the other. As
we will see, though the two sets of issues are distinct, the
scientific explanatory projects raise potential challenges for certain
philosophical views, and at the same time attention to philosophical
issues raises doubts about some of the explanatory claims made in the
name of science, which often rely on unstated and controversial
philosophical assumptions. Progress in this area will not be made
either by doing moral philosophy in isolation from the sciences or by
&lsquo;taking morality out of the hands of philosophers&rsquo; and
looking to scientific inquiry in isolation. More promising is a
careful examination of the ways in which the scientific and
philosophical projects inform each other.</p>

<h3><a name="ThrKinAppEvoEvoEth">1.1 Three Kinds of Appeal to Evolution in Evolutionary Ethics</a></h3>

<p>
Talk of &lsquo;evolutionary ethics&rsquo; may suggest a well-defined
field of inquiry, but in practice it can refer to any or all of the
following:</p>

<ol type="A">

<li><em>Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics</em>: appeals to evolutionary
theory in the scientific explanation of the origins of certain human
capacities, tendencies, or patterns of thought, feeling and behavior.
For example: the appeal to natural selection pressures in the distant
past to explain the evolution of a capacity for normative guidance, or
the origins of our sense of fairness or our resentment of cheaters.
(See section 2.)</li>

<li><em>Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics</em>: appeals to evolutionary
theory in justifying or undermining certain normative ethical claims
or theories&mdash;for example, to justify free market capitalism or
male-dominant social structures, or to undermine the claim that human
beings have a special dignity that non-human animals lack. (See
section 3.)</li>

<li><em>Evolutionary Metaethics</em>: appeals to evolutionary theory
in supporting or undermining various
 <a href="../metaethics/">metaethical</a>
 theories (i.e., theories <em>about</em> moral discourse and its
subject matter)&mdash;for example, to support a non-cognitivist
account of the semantics of moral judgment (the idea that moral
judgments do not purport to represent moral facts but instead just
express emotions, attitudes or commitments), or to undermine the claim
that there are objective moral values, or to cast doubt on whether we
could have justified beliefs about such values. (See section 4.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
All three types of project have broadly to do with <em>how
neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of
ethics or morality</em>. The driving questions, concerns,
methodologies and implications, however, differ greatly among these
three lines of inquiry.</p>

<p>
Importantly, there are no simple or straightforward moves from the
scientific projects in A to the philosophical projects in B or C.
Arguments for or against such moves require difficult philosophical
work. Indeed, philosophical issues relevant to C can have an important
bearing on at least some of the scientific explanatory projects in A.
This puts important constraints on how much can confidently be said in
favor of such scientific explanations given ongoing controversy over
the philosophical issues.</p>

<p>
It is, for example, a matter of live debate in contemporary metaethics
whether there are knowable <em>moral truths</em>&mdash;correct answers
to at least some questions about what is morally good or bad, right or
wrong. If there are, then this will likely make a difference to the
explanation of at least <em>some</em> of our moral beliefs and
behaviors. Our belief in equal human dignity, for example, along with
derivative beliefs about the wrongness of slavery or rape, might be
sufficiently explained by our having grasped the moral truth that
human beings have such dignity and so should not be treated as
&ldquo;mere means&rdquo; (see section 2.4). Similarly, the belief that
we have moral obligations to mitigate suffering even among distant
strangers might be explained at least in part by our having grasped
the moral fact that pointless suffering is intrinsically bad and that
this gives us good reason to mitigate it where we can.</p>

<p>
If this is so, then scientists will be overreaching if they claim that
&ldquo;causal explanations of brain activity and
evolution&hellip;already cover most known facts about behavior we term
&lsquo;moral&rsquo;&rdquo; (Wilson 1998, 54). Instead, a significant
amount of moral judgment and behavior may be the result of gaining
moral knowledge, rather than just reflecting causal conditioning from
evolution. This might apply even to <em>universally</em> held moral
beliefs or distinctions, which are often cited as evidence of an
evolved &ldquo;universal moral grammar&rdquo; (Mikhail 2011). For
example, people everywhere and from a very young age distinguish
between violations of merely <em>conventional</em> norms and
violations of norms involving <em>harm</em>, and they are strongly
disposed to respond to suffering with concern (Nichols
2004&mdash;though for empirically-based doubts that human responses
consistently track a clear moral/conventional distinction see Kelly
et. al. 2007). But even if this partly reflects evolved psychological
mechanisms or &lsquo;modules&rsquo; governing social sentiments and
responses, some of it may <em>also</em> be the result of human
intelligence grasping (under varying cultural conditions) genuine
morally relevant distinctions or facts&mdash;such as the difference
between the normative significance that attends harm and that which
attends mere violations of convention.</p>

<p>
We will look in more detail later at this and other possibilities for
explaining moral judgment and behavior. The point so far is just that
given the philosophical complexities here, we may ultimately need a
plurality of explanatory models drawing on both science and
philosophy. The best explanation for deeply reflective moral judgments
may turn out to look quite different from the explanation for
unreflective psychological dispositions we share with other primates,
and there may be mixed explanations for much that lies in between.</p>

<h3><a name="EmpNorSenMor">1.2 The Empirical and Normative Senses of &lsquo;Morality&rsquo;</a></h3>

<p>
As a final preliminary point, it is useful to clear up one persistent
source of confusion in discussions of morality and evolution by
distinguishing between two very different senses of
&lsquo;morality&rsquo; and the different sets of questions associated
with them.</p>

<ol type="A">

<li>The Empirical Sense of &lsquo;Morality&rsquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>
People coming from a scientific perspective, who are interested in
<em>descriptive</em> evolutionary ethics, speak of morality as
something to be explained scientifically&mdash;as in familiar talk of
&ldquo;how morality evolved&rdquo;. Here &lsquo;morality&rsquo; refers
to a certain <em>set of empirical phenomena</em>, such as the observed
capacity of human beings to make normative judgments, or the tendency
to have certain sentiments such as sympathy or guilt or blame, or
certain &lsquo;intuitions&rsquo; about fairness or violence. Just as
we can inquire into the origins and functions of other traits, such as
human linguistic capacities, we can inquire into the origins and
functions of the various psychological capacities and tendencies
associated with &lsquo;morality&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
The sense of &lsquo;morality&rsquo; in the above questions may be
called the <em>empirical sense</em> of the term, and it is in this
sense that scientists speak of &ldquo;the evolution of
morality,&rdquo; using such tools as comparative genomics and primate
studies to shed light on it (Rosenberg 2006; de Waal 1996 and 2004).
Such explanatory projects will be discussed in section 2.</p>

<ol start="2" type="A">

<li>The Normative Sense of &lsquo;Morality&rsquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>
In contrast to this, there is a very different use of the term
&lsquo;morality&rsquo; in what may be called the <em>normative</em>
<em>sense</em>. Consider the question: &ldquo;Does morality require
that we make substantial sacrifices to help distant strangers?&rdquo;
Such a question arises from the deliberative standpoint as we seek to
determine how we ought to live, and it is a normative rather than an
empirical question. We are not here asking an anthropological question
about some actual moral code&mdash;even that of our own
society&mdash;but a normative question that might lead us to a new
moral code. When we use &lsquo;morality&rsquo; in the normative sense,
it is meant to refer to <em>however it is we ought to live</em>, i.e.,
to <em>a set of norms that ought to be adopted and</em>
 <span class="nw"><em>followed</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
 
<p>
Philosophers employ this normative sense of &lsquo;morality&rsquo; or
&lsquo;moral&rsquo; in posing a variety of both normative and
metaethical questions: What does morality require of us? Does morality
have a purely consequentialist structure, as utilitarians claim? What
kind of meaning do claims about morality in the normative sense have?
Are there moral truths&mdash;i.e., truths about morality in the
normative sense&mdash;and if so, what are they grounded in and how can
we come to know them? Is morality culturally relative or at least
partly universal? (Note that this is not the same as the
<em>anthropological</em> question whether or to what extent morality
in the <em>empirical</em> sense <em>varies</em> from culture to
culture.)</p>

<p>
While morality in the normative sense is not an empirical phenomenon
to be explained, there are still important questions to ask about how
evolutionary theory may bear on it. Can we look to our evolutionary
background for moral guidance, gaining insight into the content of
morality in the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of
<em>prescriptive</em> evolutionary ethics)? (Section 3) Does
evolutionary theory shed light on metaethics, helping to resolve
questions about the <em>existence</em> and <em>nature</em> of morality
in the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of evolutionary
metaethics)? Does it, for example, lend support to nihilism (the idea
that there is really <em>no such thing</em> <em>as</em> <em>morality
in the normative sense</em>) or to skepticism (the idea that even if
there are truths about morality in the normative sense we cannot know
them, or at least could not know them if they were objective truths)?
(Section 4)</p>

<p>
Having distinguished various issues and questions, we may turn now to
consider first the scientific explanatory projects concerning morality
in the <em>empirical</em> sense.</p>

<h2><a name="DesEvoEthExpMorEmpSen">2. Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics: Explaining Morality in the Empirical Sense</a></h2>

<p>
Evolutionary explanations for morality in the empirical sense are
offered at various levels, and this makes for very different
explanatory projects with different implications. Some typical
<em>explananda</em> in accounts of &ldquo;the evolution of
morality&rdquo; are:</p>

<ol type="A">

<li>The general capacity for normative judgment and guidance, and the
tendency to exercise this capacity in social life;</li>

<li>The capacity for certain sentiments and the ability to detect them
in others;</li>

<li>The tendency to experience and to be motivated by certain
sentiments in certain types of situation;</li>

<li>The tendency to make certain particular kinds of moral judgment or
inference, or to have certain characteristic moral intuitions (i.e., a
&lsquo;moral sense&rsquo;);</li>

<li>The tendency to exhibit certain particular types of behavior in
certain types of situation (as a result of D);</li>

<li>The tendency of societies to exhibit certain particular systems of
norms or types of practice (due to D and E).</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="LevTypExpSomPos">2.1 Levels and Types of Explanation: Some Possibilities</a></h3>

<p>
It is uncontroversial that there will be evolutionary explanations of
<em>some</em> sort for the very general capacities and tendencies in A
and B: we are evolved creatures, and our psychological capacities,
like other complex capacities, are outcomes of evolutionary processes.
But this does not by itself settle whether these capacities and
tendencies are themselves <em>adaptations</em>, having evolved through
natural selection because of their adaptive effects. That is the most
common view (further explored below), but there are alternatives.</p>

<p>
It is possible, for example, that our capacity to make moral judgments
is a spin-off (side-effect or by-product) of our non-moral
intellectual capacities, which latter are
 adaptations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 On this view, we tend to make moral judgments because we are
intellectual and reflective creatures, not because natural selection
has specifically given us this moral capacity and tendency as an
adaptation; the role of natural selection would be indirect, supplying
more general capacities as adaptations, from which specifically moral
tendencies spring independently (Ayala 2006; Prinz 2008, Machery and
Mallon 2010).</p>

<p>
The deeper point, however, is that <em>whichever</em> position one
takes on the role of natural selection in the emergence of generic
capacities for moral judgment, this does not settle how best to
account for other, more specific tendencies, such as C-F. For
example:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>Even if our capacity and tendency to make moral judgments
<em>is</em> an adaptation that evolved through natural selection, it
remains possible that the <em>content</em> of at least some particular
moral judgments is derived <em>autonomously</em>, i.e., free from
causal shaping by particular elements in our evolutionary
background&mdash;in roughly the way that the contents of our beliefs
in physics or philosophy seem to be (see section 2.4 below).</li>

<li>Alternatively, even if our capacity and tendency to make moral
judgments is <em>not</em> itself an adaptation, it remains possible
that the <em>content</em> of particular moral judgments <em>is</em>
deeply shaped by evolved emotional dispositions that have affected the
content of moral judgments since human beings began making them. Such
emotional adaptations may thus have influenced cultural norms
throughout history and may continue to influence our moral judgments,
and hence our behavior, today.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since our concern is with <em>morality</em>, the crucial issue to
begin with is the origins of <em>moral judgment</em>: for morality has
not merely to do with certain emotions and behaviors (such as sympathy
and altruism) as such, but with the exercise of moral
<em>judgment</em> about how one ought to behave in various social
circumstances (Joyce 2006, ch. 2; Korsgaard 2006; Kitcher 2006c, 2011;
Machery and Mallon 2010). Certain emotions and behaviors are then
relevant too insofar as they relate to the exercise of such judgment,
but in the absence of moral judgment they seem only to belong to
proto-morality.</p>

<p>
Still, many discussions employ a looser notion of
&lsquo;morality&rsquo; that refers simply to certain kinds of socially
positive emotion or behavior, such as <em>psychological altruism</em>
(defined below). Since accounts of the origins of moral judgment rely
on these ideas as well, and these emotions or behavioral dispositions
are also often appealed to as causal influences on the content of
moral judgment, it is worth starting with a brief look at the issue of
psychological altruism, distinguishing it from merely biological
altruism.</p>

<h3><a name="BioPsyAlt">2.2 Biological and Psychological Altruism</a></h3>

<p>
Many discussions of morality and evolutionary biology focus largely on
the issue of <em>altruistic</em> feeling and behavior. This can be
confusing because in addition to <em>psychological altruism</em> there
is also <em>biological altruism</em>, which is found in many species.
(See Kitcher 2011, part I, for a comprehensive discussion.)
Psychological altruism involves <em>caring about others&rsquo; welfare
and deliberately</em> <em>benefiting them for their own sake</em>,
with no restriction on the type of benefit involved. By contrast,
biological altruism has nothing essentially to do with intentions or
motives, and it pertains only to &lsquo;benefits&rsquo; to others that
increase their <em>reproductive fitness</em> (boosting their genetic
contribution to future generations).</p>

<p>
Though psychological altruism is different from biological altruism,
there are a variety of possible explanations of the evolution of
psychological altruism that appeal to the same factors that explain
the origins of biological altruism, namely:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>Kin selection</em> or &lsquo;inclusive fitness&rsquo; theory
(Hamilton 1964);</li>

<li>Selection pressures leading to <em>teamwork</em>, <em>reciprocal
altruism</em> (Trivers 1971; Maynard Smith 1982; Axelrod 1984) and
<em>indirect reciprocity</em> (Alexander 1987; Joyce 2006); and</li>

<li><em>Group selection</em> (Sober and Wilson 1998).</li>
</ul>

<p>
It would take us too far afield to survey these biological accounts,
which are already treated in the separate entry on
 <a href="../altruism-biological/">biological altruism</a>;
 there are also many excellent and accessible summaries of such
accounts and their application to psychological altruism (e.g., Joyce
2006, ch. 1). Readers interested in a short illustration of how
<em>biological</em> altruism can be given an evolutionary explanation,
and of how evolutionary processes might likewise explain the emergence
of <em>psychological</em> altruism, can find this in the:</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="evolution-altruism.html">Supplementary Document: The Evolution of Altruism</a>
 </blockquote>

<p>
As noted earlier, however, it is important to keep in mind that this
is all just one part of explaining <em>morality</em> proper, which
goes beyond mere altruistic feeling or behavior, and will be our focus
here.</p>

<h3><a name="ExpOriMorPsyAltEvoNorGui">2.3 Explaining the Origins of Morality: From Psychological Altruism to the Evolution of Normative Guidance</a></h3>

<p>
Kitcher (2006a,b; 2011) has proposed a three-stage account of the
evolution of morality. It begins with the evolution of an early but
fragile form of psychological altruism among hominins in the context
of &ldquo;coalition games&rdquo; in mixed adult groups. The social
structure would have been similar to that of contemporary chimpanzees
and bonobos, where cooperation among the relatively weak or among
those in weak stages of life (as when just released from their
mother&rsquo;s care) is beneficial to them in the competition for
resources, but strategic calculation is infeasible. These conditions
may have led from simpler forms of biological altruism developed
through kin selection to the evolution of a psychological altruistic
disposition involving &ldquo;a blind tendency to respond to the
preferences of another animal with whom you might engage in
cooperative activity,&rdquo; as a simple but effective mechanism for
promoting advantageous participation in coalitions and subcoalitions
(Kitcher 2006b). (This is the &lsquo;indiscriminate&rsquo; altruism
mentioned in the supplement to this entry linked in the previous
sub-section.)</p>

<p>
Because this disposition was both limited and unstable, however, and
competed with powerful selfish drives, there was a continual threat of
social rupture and loss of cooperative advantage. This in turn would
have made ongoing peacemaking a necessity, thus limiting the size of
viable cooperative units and the scope of cooperative projects, as
well as imposing significant costs in devoting time and energy to
peacemaking. An example would be mutual grooming going beyond what is
necessary for hygiene, of the sort found in chimpanzee societies.</p>

<p>
The next phase, according to this hypothesis, was a transition to
larger groups with more extensive cooperative activities, through the
evolution of a <em>capacity for emotionally laden</em> <em>normative
guidance</em>. (See also Gibbard 1990, ch. 4.) With the emergence of a
capacity to make and follow normative judgments, together with
coevolved reactive emotions such as guilt and resentment, and the
development of social practices promoting group loyalty and
cooperation, a new psychological mechanism came into being for
reinforcing the previously unstable altruistic tendencies. This then
made possible larger-scale social cohesion and stability. The
advantages of membership in coalitions and subcoalitions would be
conferred on hominins who had facility with such normative
guidance&mdash;including a strong sense of obligation and tendency
toward social compliance&mdash;and who thus acted consistently on
these altruistic tendencies, acquiring the reputation for being good
coalition partners.</p>

<p>
If this hypothesis is correct, it might explain not only the origins
of our general capacity for normative judgment and motivation, but
also the widespread tendency for social rules or norms to emphasize
such things as <em>group identity, loyalty and cohesion</em>, and to
focus largely on the regulation of <em>violence</em> and <em>sex</em>;
and it might help to explain widespread dispositions toward <em>social
conformity, concern with reputation and social standing, tendencies
for group-wise scorning or punishment of the disloyal, and the power
of emotions such as resentment, guilt and shame</em>.</p>

<p>
In the final phase, this sort of &ldquo;proto-morality&rdquo; of norms
and reactive emotions is then supplemented over thousands of years
with various paths of
 <em><a href="../evolution-cultural/">cultural evolution</a></em>,
 leading to the development of much more sophisticated systems of
moral beliefs, practices and institutions, from the earliest
historical examples right up to our present moral cultures (Kitcher
2006a, 2011). There is, of course, a great deal of leeway in the last
part, concerning the details of the transition through cultural
evolution from hominin proto-moralities to current moral systems,
which allows for some very different possible stories. Some accounts
will attribute great influence to evolved, &ldquo;domain-specific
psychological modules&rdquo; (such as a dedicated mechanism that
automatically generates a feeling of concern when confronted with
suffering) in shaping the content of our moral feeling, judgment and
behavior. Other accounts, while not denying some such influence, will
emphasize very different influences on the content of at least some of
our moral beliefs, such as the &ldquo;capacity for open-ended
normativity&rdquo; cited by Buchanan and Powell (2015, 2018, 2019).
This brings us to the next major topic.</p>

<h3><a name="AutMorRefExpReaMorJudBeh">2.4 Autonomous Moral Reflection and the Explanation of Reasoned Moral Judgment and Behavior</a></h3>

<p>
So far, we have focused on scientific projects that seek causal
explanations for morality in the empirical sense. This is
unexceptionable with regard to the origins of the general human
capacity for moral judgment: clearly some causal explanation is
required, and an evolutionary explanation is plausible. But things are
more complicated when we consider the explanation of the actual
<em>content</em> of moral judgment, feeling and behavior.</p>

<p>
Human beings have a strong, emotionally-laden sense of fairness,
resentment of cheaters, and a desire that they be punished, all of
which finds expression in both cultural norms and individual moral
judgments. You might experience such feelings if you&rsquo;ve been the
victim of a scam, morally condemning the perpetrators. And some of
these psychological traits may have analogues in other species. For
example, Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal (2014) argue that
&ldquo;evidence indicates that [<em>inequity aversion</em>, i.e.,
negative reactions to unequal rewards for similar tasks] is widespread
in cooperative species under many circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;though
some have disputed this and offered alternative hypotheses to explain
the behavior, based on further research (Engelmann, Clift, Herrmann,
and Tomasello
 2017).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 In the simplest case, an animal protests when it sees a companion
receive a superior reward for a similar task, as in a well-known study
with brown capuchin monkeys, though similar effects have now been
observed even in non-primates, such as dogs and crows. In the more
complex case, chimpanzees sometimes react negatively to inequity even
where they are the ones receiving the greater reward.</p>

<p>
A natural evolutionary hypothesis for the simpler case is that such a
disposition protected against &lsquo;wasting&rsquo; cooperative
efforts where they were not fitness-enhancing. Similarly, a natural
explanatory hypothesis for more complex inequity aversion is that it
evolved in creatures with sufficient predictive capacities and
emotional control because it preserved beneficial cooperative
relationships that could be threatened by such inequities (Brosnan and
de Waal, 2014). All of this might suggest good prospects for causal
explanation of human moral traits in terms of evolved psychological
traits. Indeed, Brosnan and de Waal explicitly hypothesize that the
evolved complex response observed in champanzees is what
&ldquo;allowed the development of a complete sense of fairness in
humans, which aims not at equality for its own sake but for the sake
of continued cooperation&rdquo; (Brosnan and de Waal, 2014).</p>

<p>
Caution is needed here, however. Our moral judgments and resulting
behaviors cannot just be assumed to be mere <em>causal upshots</em> of
some such biological and psychological forces, on a par with the
cooperative activity of bees or the resentment felt by capuchin
monkeys (or even the broader unease apparently felt by chimpanzees)
over unequal rewards for equal work. When a rational agent makes a
judgment, whether in the sphere of morality or in such areas as
science, mathematics or philosophy, the proper question is not in the
first instance what <em>caused</em> that judgment to occur, but what
<em>reasons</em> the person had for making it&mdash;for thinking it to
be true. It is those reasons that typically constitute an explanation
of the judgment. They explain by bringing out what the person
<em>took</em> (rightly or wrongly) to be the <em>justification</em>
for the belief in question&mdash;the considerations showing the belief
likely to be true. All of this complicates the explanatory project in
relation to the thoughts, feelings and actions of rational agents.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s helpful to illustrate the general point first with other
kinds of judgment, and then to return to morality. Consider some
judgments in mathematics, philosophy and science:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
M: There is at least one prime number between 5,000 and 10,000.</p>

<p>
P: If identity claims such as &lsquo;water = H<sub>2</sub>O&rsquo; are
true, then they are <em>necessary truths</em> (i.e., true in all
possible worlds).</p>

<p>
S: There is no such thing as absolute simultaneity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How do we explain someone&rsquo;s believing something like M, P or S?
We normally need to know <em>her reasons</em> for believing it to be
true, which we can then go on to assess as good or bad reasons for
such a belief. Either way, we typically take her reasons&mdash;and the
<em>reasoning</em> associated with them&mdash;to explain her belief,
which is why we engage with her reasons as such in critical
discussion, and go on to inquire into their merits. If, for example,
we ask a person why she believes M, and she cites a proof she has
found convincing, showing that for any natural number <em>n</em> &gt;
1 there is at least one prime number between <em>n</em> and
2<em>n</em>, we normally take this as a sufficient explanation for why
she believes M. What we do <em>not</em> normally do is to appeal
directly to independent causes, such as evolutionary or psychological
causal influences to explain people&rsquo;s beliefs in these areas.
Such independent explanations for beliefs can sometimes be correct, as
in the case of someone given a post-hypnotic suggestion, in which case
we may regard her judgment as <em>merely caused</em> and the reasons
offered as mere rationalization. But this is not the norm.</p>

<p>
The reason why we normally explain beliefs such as M, P or S by appeal
to the reasons the person gives for them is that we normally assume
that the person is capable of intelligent reflection and reasoning and
has arrived at her belief for the reasons she gives as a result of
that reflection (whether or not the belief is ultimately correct). We
assume in general that people are capable of significant
<em>autonomy</em> in their thinking, in the following sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Autonomy Assumption</em>: people have, to greater or lesser
degrees, a capacity for reasoning that follows <em>autonomous
standards appropriate to the subjects in question</em>, rather than in
slavish service to evolutionarily given instincts merely filtered
through cultural forms or applied in novel environments. Such
reflection, reasoning, judgment and resulting behavior seem to be
<em>autonomous</em> in the sense that they involve <em>exercises of
thought that are not themselves significantly shaped by specific
evolutionarily given tendencies, but instead follow independent norms
appropriate to the pursuits in question</em> (Nagel 1979).
</blockquote>

<p>
This assumption seems hard to deny in the face of such pursuits as
algebraic topology, quantum field theory, population biology, modal
metaphysics, or twelve-tone musical composition, all of which seem to
involve precisely such <em>autonomous applications of human
intelligence</em>. Even if there are evolutionary influences behind
our general tendency to engage in certain kinds of mental activity, or
behind some of our motives in these pursuits (e.g., if a given
musician or poet is motivated to compose music or poetry in order to
impress a potential mate), this would not show the activity to be
governed in its details by such influences (cf. Buchanan and Powell
2015, 2018, and 2019). And again, this assumption of autonomy is borne
out in our normal explanations of beliefs such as P above: we take a
person at her word that what explains her believing P, for example, is
that due to philosophical arguments she has found convincing she takes
&lsquo;water&rsquo; to work like a proper name and thinks that it
follows from this that &lsquo;water&rsquo; refers to whatever
molecular compound it picks out in the actual world in all possible
worlds in which the compound exists.</p>

<p>
Few would deny the autonomy assumption altogether. To do so in the
name of providing alternative evolutionary causal explanations of our
beliefs would risk self-defeat: for if we lack the relevant
intellectual autonomy across the board, then even <em>the
biologist&rsquo;s beliefs about evolutionary biology and its
implications</em> would just be attributable to such biological
causes, rather than to reasons that provide epistemic warrant for such
beliefs. The challenge to the autonomy assumption is therefore more
likely to come in a selective
 form.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This brings us back to moral judgment. As with M, P and S, people
typically have <em>reasons</em> for their moral judgments, and whether
or not we agree with them, we typically take those reasons to explain
why they believe what they do. Consider again the moral judgment
mentioned earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
MJ: The person who cheated me did something wrong and should be
punished.
</blockquote>

<p>
As with M, P and S, someone making this judgment will have reasons
that she takes to justify this claim. And we tend to take this at face
value as an explanation of why she believes MJ, unless we have special
reason to suspect distorting causes, such as prejudice leading to
misperception and rationalization. We tend to think that a person has
the moral beliefs she does as a result of background moral reflection
and reasoning, within her cultural context. In other words, it&rsquo;s
often plausible to treat a person&rsquo;s moral beliefs much as we
treat her reasoned mathematical, scientific, or philosophical beliefs,
applying the autonomy assumption in seeking to explain why she
believes what she does.</p>

<p>
One potential lesson from evolutionary biology, however, is that even
if the autonomy assumption applies <em>in principle</em> to the sphere
of moral judgment, it may be a mistake to assume that most moral
judgment and behavior is in fact a result of the exercise of such
autonomous reflection, reasoning and judgment. The autonomy
assumption, after all, says only that we have the capacity for such
activity; it does not imply that we always exercise it. Perhaps the
human capacity for autonomous thinking is exercised only in some
cases, while in others the process that leads to moral belief is
largely influenced by evolved psychological dispositions, such as
emotional adaptations. While such a situation may not tend to arise in
relation to our mathematical, philosophical, or scientific thinking,
our evolutionary history may have given us emotional dispositions that
play a large role in at least some of our moral thinking. (See section
2.5 below.)</p>

<p>
One possibility, then, is that while many of our more reflective and
reasoned moral judgments involve autonomous exercises of
domain-general intelligence, many other less reflective moral
judgments are largely attributable to evolutionary causal
influences&mdash;both through direct conditioning of moral judgments
by evolved, domain-specific psychological dispositions and through
background influences on cultural factors. On this hypothesis, we
cannot treat moral judgments as a homogeneous set, but must recognize
that they can come about in very different ways, requiring a plurality
of explanatory models. And often some combination of models may be
necessary, as in cases where both evolutionary influences and our own
independent moral reflection might lead to similar judgments,
<em>overdetermining</em> them.</p>

<p>
For example, even if it&rsquo;s true that evolutionary pressures
favoring caring for offspring have strongly influenced our attitudes
towards our children, it does not follow that this is the complete
explanation for why we believe we have special obligations to care for
our children and for why we behave as we do toward them. It may be
<em>part</em> of the explanation, while another part may have to do
with an autonomous recognition of the <em>appropriateness</em> of
special parental care: we see that we have <em>good reasons</em> to
take special care of our children, which <em>ought</em> to motivate us
even if we weren&rsquo;t already motivated by instinctive feelings. We
might also employ autonomous, domain-general comprehensive moral
reasoning to recognize that our instinctive feelings shouldn&rsquo;t
always be followed, as in cases where considerations of justice
constrain certain pursuits of benefits for one&rsquo;s own children,
providing good reasons to refrain from unjust actions. (We&rsquo;ll
consider another plausible example of overdetermination involving
judgments about the much discussed &lsquo;Trolley cases&rsquo; in
section 3.)</p>

<h3><a name="ChaAutRefModPosHocRatEmoCauJud">2.5 The Challenge to the Autonomous Reflection Model: <em>Post Hoc</em> Rationalization of Emotionally Caused Judgment</a></h3>

<p>
A common challenge to the autonomous reflection model of moral
judgment sketched above goes as follows. While it&rsquo;s true that
people often hold their moral beliefs for <em>reasons</em> they give
in defense of them, having judged these to be good reasons for
believing the moral proposition to be true, it&rsquo;s possible that
these normative judgments about epistemic reasons or justification are
<em>themselves</em> influenced by evolutionary causal factors
operating independently of the truth of the beliefs. Indeed, on one
version of this view, our giving of <em>reasons</em> for our moral
beliefs is often just <em>post hoc rationalization</em>: Rather than
engaging in autonomous reflection or reasoning and then coming to
believe certain moral propositions for the reasons that emerge from
that reflection (as with M, P and S), what is happening instead,
according to this hypothesis, is that (1) our moral beliefs are simply
<em>caused</em> by <em>emotions</em> or &lsquo;moral instincts&rsquo;
we possess largely due to our evolutionary background, and (2) we then
invent <em>rationalizations</em> for these resulting beliefs in order
to try to make sense of them to ourselves, unaware of their real
causal origins (Haidt 2001; Wheatley and Haidt 2005; Knobe and Leiter
2007; Leiter 2007).</p>

<p>
For example, when someone judges that abortion is wrong, it may be
that &ldquo;a gut feeling that abortion is bad causes the belief that
life begins at conception (an <em>ex post facto</em> rationalization
of the gut feeling)&rdquo; (Haidt 2001, 817). On this model, our moral
reasonings and justifications are just so much window dressing for
beliefs that are more like post-hypnotic suggestions than they are
like M, P or S; just as with post-hypnotic suggestions, people
naturally provide rationalizations in an attempt to render their moral
beliefs intelligible to themselves. The difference is that instead of
a hypnotist, the causal agents are emotional dispositions stemming
from evolution, among other sources.</p>

<p>
The basic idea that <em>some</em> moral beliefs are susceptible to
such &ldquo;debunking explanation&rdquo; is not new. Moral
philosophers have long recognized that people are often led to moral
judgments based on self-interest or prejudice, for example, and then
rationalize their views, inventing justifications for positions held
due to other causes. A plausible example would be a judgment such
as:</p>

<blockquote>
MJ2: Interracial marriage is morally wrong.
</blockquote>

<p>
While such a judgment was not uncommon in the recent past, we can
recognize it to be a false judgment stemming from racial prejudice,
where much of what was said to justify it was mere <em>post hoc</em>
rationalization for a view attributable to the causal influence of
prejudice rather than to the workings of autonomous reflection and
reasononing. Most philosophers today would say the same about a moral
belief still held by many people (especially within traditional
religions):</p>

<blockquote>
MJ3: Homosexuality is morally wrong.
</blockquote>

<p>
The reason why philosophers tend to find a &lsquo;mere rationalization
hypothesis&rsquo; plausible for such beliefs as MJ2 and MJ3 is that
(i) the justifications offered for them have consistently failed to
stand up to critical reflection, and (ii) there are plausible
alternative explanations for why people have actually come to hold
such beliefs, such as that they have misconstrued personal feelings of
disgust as perceptions of objective moral wrongness, and projected
those feelings onto the world as &lsquo;moral
 impurity&rsquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Together, these considerations lend support to the hypothesis that
the justifications offered are mere rationalizations for beliefs best
explained by appeal to emotional causes.</p>

<p>
The central question, however, is: How broadly does the deflationary
model of the &lsquo;mere rationalization hypothesis&rsquo; apply to
moral judgments, and to what extent are evolutionary influences
implicated in those cases?</p>

<p>
At one extreme, someone might deny that the Autonomy Assumption
applies to the moral domain at all: we somehow lack these capacities
in the domain of moral thought. Such a claim seems to have little
plausibility, however, even if we grant that the moral domain might
indeed differ from other domains in certain ways. For example, moral
judgments may differ from mathematical or scientific judgments in
having an internal connection to motivational states: even if moral
judgments are cognitive in nature, they may carry a conventional
implicature of relevant motivational commitments of a sort other
judgments do not have (Copp 2007). But such potential differences are
not grounds for rejecting the Autonomy Assumption in the moral domain.
Why should it be that human intelligence and innovation know virtually
no bounds in other domains&mdash;as illustrated by feats of autonomous
inquiry and creativity in quantum field theory, algebraic topology,
modal metaphysics, or symphonic composition&mdash;and yet when it
comes to moral thinking we remain stuck in ruts carved out for us by
evolution, slavishly following patterns of thought prescribed for us
by evolved, domain-specific mechanisms, with all of our cultural
developments providing mere variations on those themes? </p>

<p>
The very fact of human self-consciousness casts doubt on such a
picture: for as soon as we are told that our thinking is constrained
along evolutionarily-given paths, our very awareness of those
influences provides the opening to imagine and pursue new
possibilities. If you are told that you are evolutionarily conditioned
to favor your group heavily over outsiders in your moral judgments,
you are able, as a reflective agent, to take this very fact into
account in your subsequent moral reflection, deciding that this
favoring is unwarranted and adopting a new, more egalitarian moral
 view.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Analogously, it may be true that we possess dedicated mechanisms for
&lsquo;reading&rsquo; faces as trustworthy or threatening, and often
make split-second judgments on this basis; but this doesn&rsquo;t
preclude our ability to revise such judgments, as when we reflect on
the behavior of someone with &lsquo;trustworthy facial features&rsquo;
and realize that he is actually a scoundrel.</p>

<p>
It is noteworthy that the leading proponent of the mere
rationalization hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt (2001), does <em>not</em>
take the extreme position of denying the autonomy assumption. He
grants that such capacities exist and are sometimes exercised,
singling out the moral deliberations of philosophers as likely
examples (2001, 828&ndash;29). His claim is just that such exercise of
autonomous reasoning in the production of moral judgment is rare; in
the vast majority of cases, our judgments result from immediate
&lsquo;intuitions&rsquo; reflecting emotional causation. But there are
many questions to raise even about this qualified claim.</p>

<p>
Even where our judgments are based on immediate
&lsquo;intuitions&rsquo;, it may be that these intuitions are often
themselves <em>informed</em> by <em>prior</em> acts of reflection and
reasoning (Pizarro and Bloom 2003), or are partly cognitive responses
to objective features of situations that may outrun our ability to
articulate them&mdash;much as a chess master may &lsquo;see&rsquo;
that a certain move is best prior to being able to articulate exactly
why (Kamm 1996, 2007). Similarly, input from the autonomous reasoning
of philosophers and some religious leaders may well influence the
background ethical sensibilities of whole societies, thus influencing
moral judgment even where there is no lengthy reasoning occurring in
the particular case. There are also potential philosophical worries
about the methodologies by which Haidt comes to his deflationary
conclusions about the role played by reasoning in ordinary
people&rsquo;s moral judgments.</p>

<p>
To take just one example, Haidt cites a study where people made
negative moral judgments in response to &ldquo;actions that were
offensive yet harmless, such as&hellip;cleaning one&rsquo;s toilet
with the national flag.&rdquo; People had negative emotional reactions
to these things and judged them to be wrong, despite the fact that
they did not cause any harms to anyone; that is, &ldquo;affective
reactions were good predictors of judgment, whereas perceptions of
harmfulness were not&rdquo; (Haidt 2001, 817). Haidt takes this to
support the conclusion that people&rsquo;s moral judgments in these
cases are based on gut feelings and merely rationalized, since the
actions, being harmless, don&rsquo;t actually warrant such negative
moral judgments. But there may be another potential explanation for
these judgments, as deontologists such as Kamm would emphasize: if the
subjects are not themselves <em>consequentialists</em>, and instead
hold (rightly or wrongly) that there are <em>other</em> factors that
can make an action wrong besides harmful consequences, then their
judgments might be explained by their attribution of those factors to
the case. For example, they may think (unsurprisingly) that it is
<em>disrespectful</em>, and hence wrong, to clean a toilet with their
nation&rsquo;s flag, quite apart from the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t
harm anyone; and if so, then the fact that their moral judgment lines
up with their emotions but not with a belief that there will be
harmful consequences would not show that the moral judgment is merely
caused by emotions or gut reactions: it could instead be based on the
familiar thought that the action in question is disrespectful. </p>

<p>
It remains unclear, then, just how much of human moral judgment is
susceptible to debunking explanations appealing to mere causes and
rationalizations. The mere rationalization hypothesis is best
supported when we have independent reason to reject an appeal to
autonomous reflection, as when a moral judgment is dubious in itself
and we have a likely debunking causal explanation of why someone might
nonetheless come to believe such a thing. Such is the case with MJ2
and MJ3 above, and perhaps many other traditional moral judgments
focused on <em>sexual taboos, notions of &lsquo;impurity&rsquo;,
in-group loyalty (from tribalism to nationalism), hierarchical
authority relations, and rigid gender roles</em>. But this does not
support a deflationary approach across the board.</p>

<p>
Many moral beliefs&mdash;for example, concerning the moral irrelevance
of sexual preference, the moral equality of persons of all races and
nationalities, or moral obligations even to future generations in far
away countries&mdash;are much more plausible candidates for being
upshots of autonomous moral reflection and reasoning. Indeed, many
philosophers take them to be plausible candidates for moral
<em>truths</em>, grasped through reflection that reveals <em>good
reasons</em> for believing them, which is therefore what explains our
moral beliefs and behavior in these cases.</p>

<p>
These claims may, of course, be disputed. Even if it is granted that
our judgments are often the products of our reasoning, <em>pace</em>
Haidt (2001), it remains possible that our reasoning itself is
distorted by evolutionary influences, as noted earlier. This may be
especially worrisome given the role played by <em>intuitions</em> in
moral reasoning, as when accepting premises in arguments: insofar as
there are concerns that our intuitions are distorted by evolutionary
influences, there will equally be worries about our moral reasoning
(Sinnott-Armstrong 2005).</p>

<p>
It remains unclear, however, just how far such worries extend, even if
it is granted that moral intuition and reasoning are often subject to
such distorting influence. It is hard to see, for example, how some
people&rsquo;s belief that we should impoverish ourselves and limit
our own reproduction in order to help distant strangers, or even that
we should cease having children altogether, could be explained in
terms of the distortion of their reasoning by evolutionary influences.
The striking <em>range</em> of moral beliefs itself, both across and
within cultures, seems like good evidence of significant input from
autonomous moral reflection&mdash;moral thought going beyond exercises
of evolved &ldquo;neurocomputational systems&rdquo; or &ldquo;social
contract algorithms&rdquo; or &ldquo;inference engines&rdquo; with
domain-specific goals and special inference procedures designed for
solving particular adaptive problems (Cosmides and Tooby 2008). Even
if there are indeed such special modules devoted to reasoning about
obligation and entitlement, as posited by evolutionary psychologists,
the question is how much they explain, and whether they really exclude
significant input from autonomous moral reasoning.</p>

<p>
These issues remain controversial. But the controversies are as much
ongoing <em>philosophical</em> ones as scientific ones, and it is
therefore unlikely that scientific results will settle them. Science
will not settle, for example, whether or not there are moral truths;
and if there are, they will likely play an explanatory role with
regard to at least some of our moral beliefs&mdash;something we will
miss if we approach these issues from an exclusively scientific point
of view.</p>

<p>
A duly cautious claim about the explanatory role of evolution with
respect to morality in the empirical sense might therefore be:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>The Modest Evolutionary Explanatory Thesis</em>: evolutionary
forces may adequately explain certain <em>capacities</em> and
<em>tendencies</em> associated with moral thinking, feeling and
behavior, and may explain or <em>partially</em> explain <em>some</em>
of the <em>content</em> of our moral thought, feeling and behavior,
insofar as it is influenced (individually or via influences on
cultural development) by those tendencies.
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="EvoBioNorEthPreCorEvoEth">3. Evolutionary Biology and Normative Ethics: Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Corrective Evolutionary Ethics, and the Question of Moral Progress</a></h2>

<p>
In section 1.2, we distinguished between the empirical and normative
senses of &lsquo;morality&rsquo;. This section deals with <em>morality
in the normative sense</em>. Does evolutionary biology shed light on
the content of morality in the normative sense? That is, in thinking
about how we ought to live, do we get any insight from evolutionary
theory? And does evolutionary biology have any significant
implications for thinking about the prospects for moral progress?</p>

<h3><a name="Spe">3.1 Spencer</a></h3>

<p>
The project of attempting to derive normative conclusions from the
facts of evolutionary biology is most commonly associated with Herbert
Spencer and his &ldquo;Social Darwinist&rdquo; admirers. Spencer was,
by all accounts, a more gifted and subtle thinker than he is typically
given credit for today. (See the entry on
 <a href="../spencer/">Spencer</a>.)
 Still, we may treat his views briefly here, as his arguments
concerning evolutionary biology and ethics were based on
misunderstandings of evolution. This is not to deny the historical
interest of his views. It may be surprising to learn, for example,
that Spencer himself gave a central place to harmony and <em>mutual
aid</em> in the &ldquo;permanently peaceful societies&rdquo; he viewed
as the pinnacle of evolution in its &ldquo;highest
phase&rdquo;&mdash;something one does not typically associate with
&ldquo;Social Darwinism&rdquo;, but which comes directly from
Spencer&rsquo;s (largely non-Darwinian) conception of evolution.</p>

<p>
Spencer (1879) conceived of evolution as a teleological process,
directed toward the production of progressively &ldquo;more
evolved&rdquo; (in the sense of &ldquo;superior&rdquo;) forms
manifesting a greater &ldquo;totality of life&rdquo;, i.e., a greater
richness of thought, feeling and action, as well as greater length of
life. Human behavior is &ldquo;more evolved&rdquo; than the behavior
of other animals, and the harmonious and mutually supportive behavior
of people in &ldquo;permanently peaceful societies&rdquo; (where
&ldquo;self-maintenance and race-maintenance&rdquo; is pursued without
hindering others) is &ldquo;more evolved&rdquo; than the behavior of
savages or of members of less harmonious societies; the former is the
&ldquo;highest form of conduct&rdquo; because it subserves the
greatest &ldquo;totality of life&rdquo; embodied by harmonious and
happy human social life, which is the final end of evolution.</p>

<p>
All of this, of course, is inconsistent with Darwinism, which denies
that evolution is a teleological or end-directed process, gives no
meaning to Spencer&rsquo;s notions of &ldquo;more evolved&rdquo; forms
or conduct (whereby human beings, for example, are &ldquo;more
evolved&rdquo; than other species, or ethical conduct is &ldquo;more
evolved&rdquo; than unethical conduct), and focuses on reproductive
fitness rather than on Spencer&rsquo;s notion of the &ldquo;greatest
totality of life in self, in offspring and in fellow man&rdquo;
(Rachels 1990). Spencer&rsquo;s views on morality and evolution may
therefore be set aside as historically interesting but unhelpful to
contemporary discussions.</p>

<h3><a name="BioAutEth">3.2 Biology and the Autonomy of Ethics</a></h3>

<p>
Even philosophers sympathetic to
 <a href="../naturalism-moral/">ethical naturalism</a>
 (the view that moral facts are themselves natural facts of some sort)
have typically been wary of attempts to derive conclusions about
morality in the <em>normative</em> sense from facts about evolutionary
history. This is especially so when they are clear (unlike Spencer)
about the principles governing Darwinian evolution through natural
selection. From the fact that a certain trait is an adaptation, which
evolved through natural selection by virtue of its positive feedback
effects on germ-line replication of the alleles that generate the
trait, nothing at all follows about whether it is morally good or
right, or something we ought to embrace and foster. Certain
dispositions may be present in us for good evolutionary reasons
without any implication that these traits benefit us, or are moral
virtues, or produce behaviors that are morally right.</p>

<p>
A brief survey of some of the traits that are likely biological
adaptations in a number of species&mdash;such as a tendency in lions
to kill unrelated cubs when taking over a pride, or a disposition in
male superb fairy wrens to philander&mdash;illustrates that even if
similar tendencies are likewise adaptations in human beings, present
in us for similar evolutionary reasons, this would be no argument at
all that we <em>ought</em> to live that way. Clearly the burden would
be on the prescriptive evolutionary ethicist to explain why a
trait&rsquo;s having been good at propagating the alleles coding for
it hundreds of thousands of years ago should be thought to bear on the
<em>rational or moral justification</em> <em>of our embracing it</em>.
And the prospects for meeting this burden have never seemed strong: it
is hard to see how such evolutionary facts can possibly have
<em>normative authority or force</em> for a rational agent (McDowell
1995). Regardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a
rational agent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should
I instead renounce and resist it as far as I am able? (Korsgaard
 2006).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This suggests that ethics, like mathematics, is an <em>autonomous</em>
subject in the sense that it has its own &ldquo;internal standards of
justification and criticism&rdquo;, such that its conclusions cannot
be justified by other forms of inquiry such as evolutionary biology
(Nagel 1979, 142; McDowell 1995 and 1997a,b). Normative ethical
conclusions are justified through first-order ethical reflection and
argument, just as mathematical propositions are justified through
mathematical reasoning, rather than through learning more about our
evolutionary past or about what is happening in our brains when we
engage in these forms of reasoning (Rachels, 1990). It would seem to
be as much of a mistake to try to answer ethical questions by
examining fMRI scans or studying our evolutionary history as it would
be to try to solve mathematical problems by such means (except,
perhaps, insofar as evolutionary theory may shed light on some
present, morally relevant empirical facts, as discussed below).</p>

<p>
Still, some have argued that empirical psychological studies (and
related evolutionary hypotheses&mdash;see section 4.2) can have
normative ethical implications. In particular, it has recently been
argued that scientific evidence supports <em>consequentialist</em>
ethical theories over deontological ones (Greene 2003, 2008, Singer
2005). Consider a famous pair of hypothetical cases (Thomson
1985):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Trolley</em>: a runaway trolley is heading toward five people on
the track ahead, who cannot get out of the way; it cannot be stopped,
but there is a switch you could flip that would divert it onto a side
track containing only one person;</p>

<p>
<em>Bridge</em>: a runaway trolley is heading toward five people on
the track ahead, who cannot get out of the way; you are standing on a
bridge over the track, and if you shove the very large person next to
you off the bridge and in front of the trolley, the crushing of his
body will stop the trolley before it reaches the five.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Most people hold that Trolley is permissible while Bridge is not. But
what explains this difference in moral response? Many philosophers
have argued for deontological constraints prohibiting killing some to
save others, as in Bridge; they regard the case of diverting a public
threat toward lesser harm, as in Trolley, as an exception, and offer
principled reasons for doing so, thus justifying our treating the two
cases differently (e.g., Thomson 1985). Greene (2008, 42&ndash;44)
dismisses such normative explanations as unconvincing and takes a very
different tack, highlighting another difference between Trolley and
Bridge: whereas the harm done in Bridge (shoving a man to his death)
is &ldquo;up close and personal&rdquo;, the harm done in Trolley (by
flipping a switch) is not. This difference corresponds to a difference
in the strength of emotional response, the response to
&ldquo;personal&rdquo; harm being much stronger; and this in turn
corresponds to a difference in the brain regions most active when the
cases are contemplated: Bridge tends to activate areas associated with
social/emotional processing (the posterior cingulate cortex, the
medial prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala) while Trolley produces
activity in areas associated with higher cognition (the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal lobe).</p>

<p>
Greene takes this to support the hypothesis that what accounts for
people&rsquo;s different moral responses to Trolley and Bridge is
simply the difference in emotional response, which in turn ties in to
evolutionary explanations. Given the need in our evolutionary past for
mechanisms to restrain interpersonal violence within cooperating
groups, &ldquo;it should come as no surprise if we have innate
responses to personal violence that are powerful but rather
primitive,&rdquo; predating the evolution of complex reasoning and now
competing with our more reasoned responses (Greene 2008, 43).
Deontological intuitions, such as our condemnation of the violence in
Bridge, thus represent evolved &ldquo;alarm-like emotional
responses&rdquo; which are subsequently <em>rationalized</em> rather
than resulting from moral reasoning (see the discussion of Haidt in
section 2.5); by contrast, our responses to more abstract harm such as
Trolley reflect complex cognitive processes, as do consequentialist
responses generally, including cases where people overcome their
initial negative emotional responses (in cases like Bridge) and decide
that the right thing to do is whatever produces the best overall
consequences.</p>

<p>
Greene&rsquo;s claim, then, is that this casts doubt on deontological
ethical theory: far from giving us good reasons to refrain from
certain utility maximizing acts, it merely gives expression to
emotional relics of our evolutionary history. A rational morality will
move beyond such alarm-like emotions and take us, through genuine
reasoning, in the direction of consequentialism.</p>

<p>
As with Haidt&rsquo;s claims about moral judgment (section 2.5), there
are many philosophical questions to raise about such appeals to
experimental data to draw philosophically loaded conclusions (Appiah
2008, Berker 2009, Dancy 2014, Railton 2014, FitzPatrick 2018). It is
hardly surprising, after all, that people have strong emotional
reactions to blatant rights violations such as shoving an innocent
person off a bridge in front of a trolley to be crushed for the
greater good. Such emotions would equally be expected on deontological
models. Nor does the speed with which we make negative moral judgments
in such cases show that the judgments are merely emotion-driven: even
if there is not explicit reasoning going on in each case, the
emotion-laden intuitive responses may be informed by background moral
reflection and formation (Pizarro and Bloom 2003, Dancy 2014, Railton
2014). Philosophers who are less skeptical of the normative
explanations for our judgments will find it plausible that such
reflection has made us intuitively sensitive to morally relevant
distinctions&mdash;such as the distinction between doing something to
a public threat to direct it toward least harm vs. assaulting an
innocent person and using his harm to bring about less overall harm;
that sensitivity then shows up in our intuitive moral judgments, which
are no less justified just because they provoke strong emotions.</p>

<p>
Indeed, philosophers who believe there are good reasons for
distinguishing morally between Trolley and Bridge are unlikely to be
convinced by the above debunking explanation, for the following
reason. Suppose we vary Bridge to equalize the cases for the factor
Greene emphasizes: instead of having to shove the man off the bridge,
all you have to do in Bridge Lever is flip a switch, and the switch
will activate a lever that knocks the bystander off the bridge in
front of the trolley. These cases are now equalized to be
&ldquo;impersonal&rdquo;: neither now involves violence that is
&ldquo;up close and personal&rdquo;. But does this variation change
our moral response? If it does not, and we find Bridge Lever again
objectionable (just like Bridge) while allowing for Trolley, then
Greene&rsquo;s proposed explanation would not work: we would need a
different explanation for this pair of cases, such as the
reason-giving explanation deontological philosophers would give. Even
with regard to the original pair of cases, while Greene may be right
that evolved dispositions against personal violence play some role in
explaining our reactions, this needn&rsquo;t be the whole explanation.
It may be that this is another case of <em>overdetermination</em> (see
section 2.4).</p>

<h3><a name="CorUseEvoBioNorEth">3.3 Corrective Uses of Evolutionary Biology in Normative Ethics</a></h3>

<p>
Darwinian evolutionary theory tells us that human beings are members
of an evolved species related by common ancestry to every other
species on Earth. So if certain ethical views <em>rely</em> on
assumptions about special creation, for example, they will be refuted
by the success of evolutionary theory. More weakly, insofar as certain
ethical views have traditionally been <em>supported</em> by claims
about special creation, they will to that extent lose some of their
support. In removing some of their common support, evolutionary theory
would thus pose a significant challenge to those who had relied on
that support (Rachels 1990).</p>

<p>
Rachels takes such an approach against the common belief that human
beings have a special moral dignity that is higher than the status
enjoyed by non-human animals. Such a belief has traditionally been
rooted in the idea that we are separate from other living things,
having been created specially in the image of God and endowed with
souls, giving us a special moral status. If evolutionary theory is
true, however, then this support is undermined: since <em>Homo
sapiens</em> evolved from other species, there is no sharp biological
separation between <em>Homo sapiens</em> and the rest of the living
world; there is instead a continuum through evolutionary history, with
no species created separately or infused with special souls. Those who
have based their beliefs about the special moral status of human
beings on a creationist picture therefore have a problem: that picture
is false, and the correct account does nothing to support such
beliefs.</p>

<p>
This does not, however, show that the common view of special human
dignity is false or even unjustified. It may be supported by other
considerations that do not depend on creationist assumptions. Although
we are related to other animals, we remain strikingly different from
even our closest primate relatives, as any visitor to our planet would
see at once. The vast differences between human and other forms of
life on Earth is not erased by pointing out that human beings got to
be the way we are through contingent evolutionary processes acting on
brains similar to those of extant apes, together with thousands of
years of cultural evolution. And it is these
differences&mdash;regardless of how they came about&mdash;that many
will take to ground differences in the moral status of human beings
and other
 animals.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
There are more straightforward ways in which evolutionary biology or
empirical moral psychology might play corrective roles in normative
ethics. Evolutionary biology and comparative genetics might be used to
undermine false claims about race, which underlie racist ethical
claims. Experimental psychology might be used to cast doubts on the
moral condemnation of homosexuality by supporting the debunking
hypothesis that such judgments stem from projected disgust.
Psychological experiments can expose typical human pitfalls in moral
judgment and behavior, such as tendencies toward cruelty in conditions
of power inequality, or toward exaggerated moral condemnation when
experiencing disgust or stress. If we understand these facts about
ourselves, we can more effectively pursue and realize normative goals
such as non-violence or fairness by avoiding circumstances that lead
to cruelty, or by watching for and correcting distorting influences on
our judgment (Glover 2000; Appiah 2008, 49, 71&ndash;72, 110&ndash;11,
124; Buchanan and Powell 2018).</p>

<h3><a name="QueMorPro">3.4 The Question of Moral Progress</a></h3>

<p>
While it may be difficult to assess whether a society has made moral
progress <em>on the whole</em> over some period, it is not hard to
find plausible examples of progress along particular dimensions. The
elimination of the Atlantic slave trade and the development of the
modern human rights movement are compelling examples of widespread
moral progress. There are also avenues to further progress through
improved conformity with legitimate moral norms and through
improvements in moral concepts, reasoning, and understanding. We might
then wonder: what are the drivers of such moral progress (and likewise
of moral regression when it occurs)? And how might evolutionary
biology bear on the prospects and strategies for achieving moral
progress (and avoiding moral regression)? Allen Buchanan and Rachell
Powell take up these issues in wide-ranging theoretical work that
potentially has practical implications for a number of current social
and political problems, as discussed below (Buchanan and Powell 2018,
2019; Buchanan 2020; see also the symposium discussion of the 2018
book in <em>Analyse &amp; Kritik</em> 41(2), 2019).</p>

<p>
Different metaethical stances (see section 4) yield different
understandings of what moral progress consists in as well as different
explanations for how it has historically come about. A moral realist,
for example, will conceive of moral progress in terms of achieving a
more accurate grasp of objective moral truths and refining practices
and institutions to align more closely with them; and plausible
examples will be explained largely by appeal to growing insight into
moral truth (Huemer 2016). By contrast, those who reject appeals to
objective moral truths but wish to retain some notion of moral
progress will formulate a different conception of progress and offer
socio-cultural explanations of progressive changes that do not appeal
to improved insights into moral truth (Kitcher 2011). In any case, we
might ask: what bearing does our evolutionary past have on our
prospects and strategies for achieving the sorts of changes that might
constitute moral progress?</p>

<p>
Suppose that the trend toward greater inclusivity in moral
consideration&mdash;i.e., the elimination of racial and gender
barriers to the attribution of full human moral status, and the
extension of substantial moral considerability to non-human
animals&mdash;counts as moral progress. Some might worry that human
moral psychology may have evolved in such a way as to constrain the
possibilities for achieving robust and sustained progress like this.
While our evolved psychology may contain some altruistic elements,
these may be ultimately parochial, given the nature of the selection
pressures faced by our Pleistocene ancestors (assuming, as many do,
that the long Pleistocene Epoch&mdash;roughly 2.6 million years ago to
11,700 years ago&mdash;is the one primarily relevant to the biological
evolution of human psychological
 traits).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Our evolved altruism may be focused on kin and members of a perceived
in-group, while other countervailing dispositions pose strong
obstacles to extending that altruism to outside groups. Even if we
have a capacity for autonomous moral thought, enabling some to grasp
more inclusive moral truths, there may be powerful evolutionary
constraints built into human moral psychology that make such ideas
unlikely to take hold and motivate progressive changes in a widespread
and sustainable way. Perhaps we are just saddled, as evolved primates,
with a largely <em>exclusivist, tribalist</em> morality.</p>

<p>
This pessimistic idea, which Buchanan and Powell refer to as
&ldquo;evoconservatism,&rdquo; has been used to argue against social
movements organized around &ldquo;cosmopolitan moral reform.&rdquo;
And on the other side of the same evolutionary coin,
&ldquo;evoliberals&rdquo; share the premise about the constraints
imposed by evolution on human moral psychology but instead argue that
since the progressive goals are sufficiently desirable, we should look
for biotechnological interventions to <em>alter</em> human nature in
such a way as to make those goals realistically achievable. Buchanan
and Powell reject both views because they reject the underlying
picture of evolved human moral nature. Instead, they argue that the
shifts that have already occurred toward more inclusive morality, as
well as attention to the conditions under which moral regression
occurs, support a very different, more nuanced picture of evolved
human moral psychology&mdash;one without such pessimistic
implications.</p>

<p>
On their &ldquo;biocultural&rdquo; view, it is not just that human
rationality allows for autonomous moral reasoning that can lead to
greater inclusivity (section 2.4 above), but that our evolved moral
psychology itself contains the seeds for such a shift (though it
equally contains the seeds for potential moral regression). The key
idea is that our evolved moral nature is neither inherently tribalist
nor inherently inclusivist, but contains <em>both</em> dispositions;
their expression, however, is conditional on the socio-institutional
environmental circumstances. In some conditions tribalistic
dispositions will be engaged, while in others inclusivist dispositions
can dominate. This is their &ldquo;adaptive plasticity&rdquo; model of
evolved human moral psychology, according to which evolution has
disposed us to think and behave in certain ways under one set of
conditions, and in very different ways under another set of
conditions&mdash;this having been fitness-enhancing in our
evolutionary history. In particular, our tribalist tendencies are
activated when &ldquo;cues of out-group threat&rdquo; are perceived
(whether real or not), involving competition, disease, undermining of
in-group cohesion, and so on; by contrast, our inclusivist tendencies
are activated when such cues are less abundant or salient.</p>

<p>
The hypothesis is that these adaptively plastic traits served the
biological interests of Pleiostocene humans well, achieving the joint
benefits of tribalism under conditions where it was fitness-enhancing
and more inclusive morality under conditions where tribalism was
counterproductive and greater inclusivity was beneficial. For us
today, this constitutes a mixed inheritance: on the one hand, it
provides us with the seeds for moral progress if we can foster the
socio-institutional contexts that allow more inclusive dispositions to
flourish; on the other hand, it saddles us with vulnerability to
destructive tribalism when we find ourselves (or even just
<em>perceive</em> ourselves to be) in circumstances characterized by
sufficient out-group threat cues. Buchanan and Powell argue that this
makes human beings dangerously susceptible to moral regression due to
the manipulation of perceptions through demagogic populism, for
example&mdash;a danger that is exacerbated where disinformation is
rapidly spread through social media. If they are right, then the
situation is ripe for media-savvy politicians to manipulate popular
beliefs in ways designed to trigger the threat cues that energize
tribalist tendencies in thought, feeling and behavior for political
gain&mdash;from reflexive anti-immigrant nationalist sentiment to
racially charged scapegoating during a pandemic.</p>

<p>
While these dangers cast doubt on the conviction that moral progress
is inevitable or even the natural default, the proposed model
preserves hope for continued and deepening moral progress: it is
possible for humanity to make and sustain deep moral progress, without
being hamstrung by inbuilt evolutionary constraints; but it will
require ongoing cultural efforts to foster and sustain the
socio-institutional circumstances that enable the better aspects of
human moral nature to predominate (Buchanan, forthcoming). This is the
practical message of this biocultural theory of moral progress: moral
progress is possible for us without the need for biotechnological
modifications of human nature; but such progress is also fragile and
cannot be taken for granted (Buchanan and Powell 2018).</p>

<h2><a name="EvoMet">4. Evolutionary Metaethics</a></h2>

<p>
While evolutionary facts may do little to illuminate the
<em>content</em> of morality in the normative sense, they are
sometimes thought to tell us something about the <em>existence</em>
and <em>nature</em> of morality in the normative sense. (See section
1.2 for the notion of morality in the normative sense.) Some
philosophers have claimed that evolutionary theory can be used to
debunk certain <em>metaethical</em> theories and perhaps to support
others. One relatively modest project along these lines would be to
use evolutionary biology to undermine Aristotelian appeals to natural
teleology in human life to account for ethical facts, along the lines
of Foot (2001). This evolutionary-based critique of
&ldquo;teleological naturalism&rdquo; in ethics (FitzPatrick 2000) is
discussed in the</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="natural-teleology-ethics.html">Supplementary Document: Natural Teleology in Ethics</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
Other projects involve using evolutionary biology to try to undermine
traditional
 <a href="../moral-realism/">moral realism</a>&mdash;the
 view that moral judgments can be true (accurately representing moral
facts) in a way that does not depend on our evaluative attitudes, and
that we can know at least some of these truths. Such arguments are
taken to support moral skepticism (according to which we cannot
possess moral knowledge) or
 <a href="../moral-anti-realism/">moral antirealism</a>
 (for example, views that construe moral truths as functions of our
evaluative attitudes, or views according to which moral judgments
function to express attitudes or acceptance of norms rather than to
represent moral facts, or error-theoretic views according to which all
positive moral judgments are false).</p>

<h3><a name="GenEvoBioDebMor">4.1 General Evolutionary Debunking Arguments</a></h3>

<p>
Evolutionary accounts of the origins of our capacity to be guided by
moral judgments do not require any appeal to the comprehension of
moral <em>truths</em> by our hominin ancestors, or even to the
existence of such truths. Such stories require only claims about
natural selection pressures having favored the development of such a
capacity and tendency because of positive effects on biological
fitness (Kitcher 2006a, 176, and 2011; Joyce 2006, 131, 184; Street
2006, 127 f.; Griffiths and Wilkins 2015). Should this fact undermine
our confidence in the existence of objective moral truths or in the
possibility of our knowing them?</p>

<p>
Proponents of &lsquo;evolutionary debunking arguments&rsquo; think it
should, arguing either that evolutionary considerations support moral
skepticism (Joyce 2006, 2013, 2016) or that they at least undermine
traditional moral realism by providing a defeater for our moral
beliefs <em>if</em> correctness for moral beliefs is construed in a
realist fashion as accurate representation of objective or independent
moral truths (Street 2006, 2008). (For discussion of these arguments,
see Copp 2008, Kahane 2011, Enoch 2011, Skarsaune 2011, Shafer-Landau
2012, Berker 2014, Fraser 2014, FitzPatrick 2014a,b and 2017a,b,
Vavova 2015, Rini 2016, Levi and Levi 2020, Korman and Locke, 2020,
McKay 2023, among many others.)</p>

<p>
On the face of it, the mere fact that natural selection would not have
&lsquo;designed&rsquo; our moral faculties to track moral truths is
not obviously problematic. There are, after all, lots of cases where
we seem able to grasp truths that played no role in the story of how
our mental capacities evolved. We can grasp truths of quantum field
theory or higher dimensional topology or, for that matter, philosophy
(or so we are assuming in even engaging in this debate!) even though
those truths had nothing to do with why the basic capacities
underlying these abilities evolved in our Pleistocene ancestors. While
the underlying capacities evolved in response to selection pressures
in ancestral hunter-gatherer environments, we have evidently learned
how to develop, train and exercise them in cultural contexts to
discover truths that go far beyond anything relevant to the evolution
of the underlying capacities. Philosophers who endorse some form of
moral realism have typically held that we&rsquo;ve done the same thing
in grasping moral truths (sections 2.4&ndash;2.5).</p>

<p>
Suppose, however, that evolutionary influences not only did not design
our faculties to track moral truths, but positively shaped them in
ways that have pervasively conditioned the <em>content</em> of our
moral thought and feeling, through evolved emotional dispositions or
&ldquo;domain specific modules&rdquo; that gave us moral instincts
that shape our beliefs. Debunkers claim that this is the case and
argue that it has deep metaethical implications. Though there are a
variety of formulations of such arguments (some attacking moral
knowledge itself, others seeking only to undermine moral realism by
showing that it would saddle us with moral skepticism), a core
argument based on the work of Sharon Street can be spelled out roughly
like this:</p>

<h4>Evolutionary Debunking Argument:</h4>

<p>
&ldquo;Our system of evaluative judgments is thoroughly saturated with
evolutionary influence,&rdquo; because of the role natural selection
played in shaping underlying psychological dispositions (Street 2006,
114). But natural selection shaped those dispositions simply based on
which variations best contributed to the biological fitness of our
hominin ancestors, rather than in ways that would be expected to track
independent moral truths as such, even if they existed. That is,
natural selection rewarded moral belief-forming dispositions that
yielded whatever moral beliefs led to behaviors that caused
hunter-gatherers to out-reproduce their peers and propagate their
genes more effectively, regardless of whether or not these beliefs
happened to accurately represent a realm of independent moral truths.
(The same would have been true for religious beliefs and theological
truths: all that mattered were the relevant effects on genetic
propagation, as through increased cooperation and rule following based
on belief in a watchful god, assuming the religious belief-forming
dispositions were under genetic control. Theological truth or falsity
was beside the point.) But since realists do not take moral truths
simply to be a function of what helped Pleistocene hunter-gatherers
maximize their reproductive output, it would be a <em>sheer
coincidence</em> if our evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs happened
to align with the moral truths, accurately representing them.</p>

<p>
Street continues by arguing that we are not justified in thinking that
any such sheer coincidence has taken place; therefore, we cannot have
any justified confidence that our moral beliefs accurately represent
independent moral truths of the sort posited by realists. That is, our
justification for our moral beliefs is defeated by these evolutionary
considerations, at least if truth for moral beliefs consists in
accurately representing independent moral facts, as realists maintain.
(Epistemic internalists may deny that the facts cited above would by
themselves render our moral beliefs unjustified. But even they should
agree that <em>once we become aware of those facts</em> our moral
beliefs would thereby be rendered unjustified, at least given a
realist model of what it would be for them to be true.) So realism
saddles us with skepticism. And if such skepticism is implausible,
then realism must be rejected in favor of an antirealist view (such as
moral subjectivism) that would still allow for justified moral beliefs
despite evolutionary influences and our awareness of them (Street
2006, 2008).</p>

<p>
One response to this argument, on behalf of naturalistic realism,
grants the claim of pervasive evolutionary influence on the contents
of moral beliefs but challenges the claim that this should undermine
our confidence in these beliefs. David Copp (2008) has argued that on
the conception of moral truths implied by his society-centered moral
naturalism, it is plausible to suppose that a moral psychology shaped
by natural selection in social contexts would yield moral beliefs that
track moral truths at least reasonably well as a first approximation.
On his view, moral truths are grounded in moral standards embodied in
codes that would enable societies to meet their basic needs (continued
existence, stable cooperation among members, internal harmony and
peaceful relations with other societies). Given the account of the
evolution of human moral psychology sketched in section 2.3, involving
the evolution of a capacity for normative guidance in connection with
promoting social stability and cooperation (ultimately because of
effects on genetic propagation), and further contributions of cultural
evolution toward the development of moral codes fostering those same
goals, many of our moral beliefs would naturally have to do with
conditions for social stability and cooperation. Since on the proposed
naturalistic view this is just what moral truths are about, there
would thus be a tendency for our moral beliefs to have been shaped in
ways that <em>do</em> tend to track moral truths, especially combined
with continued cultural developments for correcting beliefs or
attitudes that fail to contribute to these social goals.</p>

<p>
Street (2008) has replied to this proposed way out of the problem, in
part, by noting that Copp&rsquo;s strategy relies on his intuitions
about what the moral truths are, as reflected in his society-centered
moral theory. But those are precisely the intuitions of an
<em>evolved</em> moral theorist, <em>ex hypothesi</em> influenced by
the same evolutionary factors that influenced the moral beliefs in
question. So of course we can expect there to be a decent alignment
between our evolutionarily-shaped moral beliefs and the moral truths
described by a moral theory spun by the very same
evolutionarily-shaped mind. Such a move, she argues, therefore cannot
really help the realist (though see Copp 2019 for a reply). It would
be different if God independently revealed to us what the moral truths
are, so that we could then go check our moral beliefs against them and
perhaps discover that they line up; but instead, Street worries, all
we&rsquo;re doing is comparing our moral beliefs with a purported list
of moral truths yielded by a theory we find plausible precisely
because it is appealing to our evolved sensibilities (though see Locke
2014 and FitzPatrick 2014b for some complications here).</p>

<p>
Similar and even worse worries arise for a subset of
<em>non</em>-naturalists who grant the debunkers&rsquo; claims about
pervasive evolutionary influence and also concede that moral
properties and facts have played no role at any point in the formation
of our moral beliefs, which have instead been caused by some
&lsquo;third factor&rsquo; that <em>happens</em> to have brought about
the desired correlation (Wielenberg 2010, Enoch 2011). Perhaps the
&lsquo;evolutionary aim&rsquo;, survival and reproduction, also
happens to be good, so that in giving us moral beliefs that promoted
survival and reproduction evolution also happened to give us moral
belief dispositions that are largely accurate (Enoch 2011). But the
question is again how one is entitled to rely on moral intuitions
(e.g., that survival and reproduction are good) in telling that story,
even <em>after</em> granting that those intuitions are <em>simply</em>
the product of &lsquo;morally blind&rsquo; causes, i.e., causes
operating entirely insensitively to moral properties and facts. There
are also difficulties concerning oversimplifications in such accounts
(e.g., regarding the &lsquo;evolutionary aim&rsquo;) and the fact that
on this approach the correlations between moral beliefs and moral
truths ultimately rest on a mere accident, raising doubts about
whether such accounts can really make sense of moral knowledge and
understanding (Bedke 2009, FitzPatrick 2014b).</p>

<p>
There are other alternatives for realists, however. Street&rsquo;s
objection to Copp, after all, has teeth only if the realist has
already granted the strong claims about &ldquo;tremendous&rdquo; and
pervasive evolutionary influence &ldquo;saturating&rdquo; our moral
beliefs across the board. It is far from clear, however, why realists
should accept such strong claims to begin with. As discussed in
section 2, it seems doubtful that the scientific evidence itself
supports such strong claims about the etiology of &lsquo;our&rsquo;
moral beliefs. Even if there is significant evolutionary influence on
the content of many of our moral beliefs, it remains possible that
many of our moral beliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases
wholly) through autonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as
with our mathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs.</p>

<p>
Consider how a moral realist will approach the above debunking
argument. It is intended to show us that realism is untenable, which
means that this conclusion cannot just be <em>assumed</em> from the
start. Yet if we begin the argument allowing that there may be
independent moral truths, then why should we accept the initial claim
about the pervasive influence of evolutionary forces on the content of
our moral thinking in the first place? If there are independent moral
truths, then we may plausibly have grasped many of them through
autonomous exercises of our capacities for moral reflection, whereby
we have come to recognize good reasons for thinking certain moral
propositions to be true, by correctly grasping that certain features
of actions are wrong-making, say.</p>

<p>
Suppose you believe that human trafficking is wrong. This belief is
plausibly best explained by citing your reasons for holding it: you
believe it&rsquo;s wrong for the reasons you give, such as the fact
that it causes tremendous suffering and deprivation, violates the
basic dignity and rights of its victims, and so on. From a realist
perspective, these features you cite in giving your reasons for the
belief are in fact wrong-making features of human trafficking, i.e.,
features that make trafficking wrong and therefore <em>make true</em>
the moral proposition that human trafficking is wrong. On this
picture, you therefore believe that trafficking is wrong because it
<em>is</em> wrong and you&rsquo;ve come to recognize the moral fact
that it is wrong by recognizing the reasons why it is wrong
(FitzPatrick 2016).</p>

<p>
Unless realism has <em>already</em> been rejected for other reasons,
then, this picture is an open possibility at the start of the debate,
so that the realist may reasonably hold that many of our moral beliefs
are in fact not merely caused by evolutionary and other &lsquo;morally
blind&rsquo; influences, but are instead well-grounded responses to
moral reality. The realist therefore need never grant the
debunker&rsquo;s strong claims to the effect that our moral beliefs
across the board are saturated with evolutionary influence. Perhaps
some are and some aren&rsquo;t, and the proportions will depend on the
extent to which we&rsquo;ve successfully exercised autonomous
reflection in arriving at our moral beliefs. If there are enough
autonomous beliefs in the mix, and we can identify them, then the rest
of the debunking argument will not go through (FitzPatrick 2014a,b;
2016,
 2017a,b).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The debunking argument would be strengthened if we had good reason to
be skeptical about autonomous moral reflection. In this vein, Street
claims that whatever moral reflection and reasoning we engage in is
limited merely to assessing &ldquo;thoroughly contaminated&rdquo;
evaluative beliefs using &ldquo;tools of rational reflection [that
are] equally contaminated&rdquo; (Street 2006: 124). But this claim is
itself based upon the very premise in question: the tools of
reflection are allegedly thoroughly contaminated <em>because of</em>
the &ldquo;tremendous&rdquo; evolutionary influence on the content of
&ldquo;our&rdquo; moral judgments across the board; yet our question
was why we should believe the latter in the first place. Until we are
given independent reason to discount the power of moral reflection,
treating it as nothing more than using some rotten apples to judge
other rotten apples, we seem to have little reason to dismiss the
possibility of autonomous moral reflection, and therefore little
reason to accept the crucial claim of pervasive
&ldquo;saturation&rdquo; of our moral beliefs with evolutionary
influence.</p>

<p>
Finally, Street challenges the realist to specify what faculty or
capacity might ground our ability to arrive at independent moral
truths, how the former evolved, and how the latter could have arisen
as a byproduct of it. She claims that there is no plausible story to
be told here, since the capacity to grasp independent moral truths
would have to be &ldquo;a highly specialized, sophisticated
capacity&rdquo; akin to the human eye, and no such entity could
plausibly emerge &ldquo;as the purely incidental byproduct of some
unrelated capacity that was selected for on other grounds
entirely&rdquo; (Street 2006, 142&ndash;43). But the realist&rsquo;s
story needn&rsquo;t take that form. The claim will be just that our
capacity to grasp moral truths&mdash;like our capacity to grasp
philosophical truths about metaphysical necessity, say&mdash;is simply
a byproduct of our general capacities for critical reasoning, combined
with the evolved capacity for forming and employing normative concepts
in our thinking and decision-making.</p>

<p>
A related but somewhat different debunking argument focuses on the
origins of moral <em>concepts</em> (Joyce 2006, chap. 6). It begins
with the claim that we have a <em>complete</em> <em>non</em>-<em>moral
genealogy</em> of our moral beliefs&mdash;a complete explanation of
how we&rsquo;ve come to believe what we do, which does not require any
appeal to moral <em>truths</em>. Instead, we explain the origins of
our moral concepts&mdash;such as fairness, justice, and guilt&mdash;in
evolutionary terms (involving the impacts of their employment on
genetic propagation); and then we explain our beliefs employing those
concepts in familiar sociological and psychological terms. The claim
is then that the existence of such a non-moral geneaology of moral
beliefs makes the notion of moral truths &ldquo;explanatorily
superfluous&rdquo;&mdash;just as truths about witches are
explanatorily superfluous given a complete genealogy of beliefs about
witches that does not appeal to any truths about witches. And if moral
truths are explanatorily superfluous, then we should not posit them,
any more than we posit truths about witches: we should remain agnostic
about moral truth and give up any claims to moral knowledge. In other
words, evolutionary biology leads to moral skepticism.</p>

<p>
The critical questions about this argument parallel those raised about
the previous one. Even if crude versions of our <em>concepts</em> of
fairness or guilt originated through evolutionary processes in our
hominin ancestors, independently of any connection to moral truths, it
remains possible that through cultural evolution we have developed
refined <em>conceptions</em> of fairness or guilt that can be employed
in epistemically respectable ways (FitzPatrick 2014a). Regardless of
how and why the concept of fairness originated, why should we doubt
that we can today use a refined conception of fairness to state moral
truths, such as the truth that race-based voting laws are unfair and
wrong? If there are grounds of skepticism about this they would have
to lie in reasons to doubt the soundness of our first-order moral
arguments about fairness, rather than in claims about how and why a
crude version of the concept first arose (Nagel 1997). Absent such
doubts, it&rsquo;s not clear why the mere fact of historical
evolutionary influence should undermine our confidence in our moral
claims.</p>

<p>
In general, the worry about Joyce&rsquo;s debunking argument is
similar to the worry about Street&rsquo;s: unless we start out
<em>already</em> assuming (<em>contra</em> realism) that there are no
knowable moral truths, it&rsquo;s hard to see why we should accept
Joyce&rsquo;s premise that we possess a <em>complete</em>
<em>non</em>-moral geneaology of moral judgment, and hence that it is
explanatorily superfluous to posit moral truths. Whether or not the
non-moral geneaology is complete is precisely what is in question in
ongoing metaethical debates: realists, who posit knowable moral
truths, can reasonably hold that the correct explanation for at least
many of our moral beliefs <em>does</em> appeal to moral truths or
facts that we have grasped, while anti-realists, who deny the
existence of such truths, claim that the correct explanation for all
of our moral beliefs involves no such appeal. The issue remains
controversial. So unless we have independently settled that issue
against realism, it&rsquo;s unclear why one should accept the premise
that there is a complete non-moral genealogy of our moral beliefs:
there may well be a <em>partial</em> non-moral genealogy, but it will
be <em>complete</em> only if <em>none</em> of our moral beliefs are
the result of our having grasped moral truths; and this negative claim
seems unlikely if there are in fact knowable moral truths (since we
would plausibly have grasped some of them, and they would thus figure
into the explanation of some of our moral beliefs). Whether one grants
Joyce&rsquo;s premise that there <em>is</em> a complete non-moral
genealogy will depend on whether one has <em>already given up</em> on
the idea of knowable moral truths. But that makes it hard to see how
the argument as a whole can be used to persuade anyone who
doesn&rsquo;t already accept its conclusion.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s worth noting that the appeal to evolution to support
general skeptical worries about ethics is not new: it goes all the
back to Darwin himself. Consider the following provocative, fanciful
reflection (later echoed closely by E.O. Wilson 1978, 204&ndash;206),
which at least suggests a kind of debunking argument:</p>

<blockquote>
It may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that
any strictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to
become as active and as highly developed as in man, would acquire
exactly the same moral sense as ours. In the same manner as various
animals have some sense of beauty, though they admire widely different
objects, so they might have a sense of right and wrong, though led by
it to follow widely different lines of conduct. If, for instance, to
take an extreme case, men were reared under precisely the same
conditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our
unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty
to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile
daughters; and no one would think of interfering. Nevertheless the
bee, or any other social animal, would in our supposed case gain, as
it appears to me, some feeling of right and wrong, or a conscience
(Darwin 1871, 73).
</blockquote>

<p>
The argument suggested by this passage is that our moral sense, which
generates our moral beliefs, has the shape and content it has because
of the contingencies of human ecology; had creatures with a very
different ecology, such as bees, come to be rational, they would thus
have developed a very different moral sense suitable to their ecology.
But then which of these very different moral senses could be expected
to track moral truths (if they exist)? The answer seems to be:
<em>neither</em> (unless we simply relativize moral truths to various
possible ecologies, taking such truths to reduce to facts about
effective genetic propagation&mdash;though as noted in section 3, such
a move has little moral plausibility). Moral senses are contingent
products of particular ecologies in a way that cannot be expected to
track independent and stable moral truths. We and the hypothetical
rational bees will thus have very different moral outlooks, each of
which is explicable in terms of our respective ecologies and will seem
quite natural to those occupying the relevant ecology, but neither of
which seems to have any claim to be a reliable guide to <em>moral
truth</em>. This imaginary exercise in perspective thus seems to
support moral skepticism: the very idea of independent, stable moral
truths will seem suspect (playing no role in the explanation of the
origins of various possible moral senses), and our confidence that our
moral sense would track them will seem unwarranted.</p>

<p>
What such an argument overlooks, however, is precisely the factor of
<em>autonomous moral reflection</em> that the bees&rsquo; imagined
rationality would bring with it (see sections 2.4&ndash;2.5, and
McDowell 1995). True, we might expect relatively unreflective and
tradition-bound bees to speak of &ldquo;sacred duties&rdquo; to kill
brothers or fertile daughters, in a way that lines up with the genetic
relations that figured into the evolution of their moral senses. But
we could equally expect more reflective bees (the buzzing philosophers
among them) to raise the question whether they really had <em>good
reason</em> to do everything that their evolution has disposed them to
do in the service of maximizing their genetic propagation. These more
philosophical bees might ask whether some potential goods of bee life,
in the context of ongoing innovations in rational bee culture, might
be available to them if they resisted certain impulses and acted
differently; and this might lead to the development of at least partly
autonomous moral norms, and hence to moral senses that are a complex
mixture of inherited dispositions and rational judgment. If bees
became rational, then, there is no reason to suppose that their moral
sensibilities would simply reflect their ecology any more than human
moral sensibilities simply reflect human ecology: to the extent that
they are really rational, we should expect some autonomous reflection,
and perhaps even significant overlap with autonomous human moral
reflection, as we both strive for something beyond the merely
biologically useful (FitzPatrick 2000, 355&ndash;56, and 2017b).</p>

<h3><a name="SelEvoBioDebMor">4.2 Selective Evolutionary Debunking Arguments</a></h3>

<p>
In addition to the general debunking arguments considered above, which
are aimed at debunking morality (or in Street&rsquo;s case, debunking
a realist construal of it) <em>as a whole</em>, there are also
evolutionary debunking arguments meant instead just to target a
<em>selected range</em> of moral beliefs as epistemically suspect.
Such selective debunking arguments may be deployed by moral realists
who reject general debunking arguments but nonetheless wish to use
similar tactics to discredit certain kinds of moral belief as part of
advancing their own <em>normative</em> <em>ethical</em> project. They
might argue, for example, that while the deontological beliefs held by
their opponents can be successfully debunked by appeal to evolutionary
considerations, their own utilitarian ethical beliefs are immune from
such debunking, stemming from autonomous rational reflection rather
than from evolved psychological modules.</p>

<p>
This is the strategy adopted by Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter
Singer (2014) in an effort to support Sidgwick&rsquo;s principle of
Universal Benevolence, i.e., impartial utilitarianism. That principle
is inconsistent not only with moral egoism but with any moral stance
that incorporates limited forms of partiality (such as special duties
to family and friends even when not utility-maximizing, or constraints
against taking certain means when promoting utility, or moral
permissions to favor oneself or loved ones over strangers). So in
order to discredit such competing moral views, they claim that one can
tell debunking evolutionary stories to &lsquo;explain away&rsquo;
these non-utilitarian moral beliefs as unreliable products of
distorting evolutionary influences: people believe such things only
because natural selection shaped human moral psychology in the
direction of selfishness and at best parochial altruism, for Darwinian
reasons having nothing to do with moral truth. Then they treat the
possibility of telling such debunking evolutionary stories as
sufficient to undermine epistemic justification for the targeted moral
beliefs. At the same time, however, they maintain that their own
favored ethical beliefs, involving strict impartiality, are
invulnerable to any similar treatment, so that we can remain confident
in the rationality of utilitarian morality.</p>

<p>
There are reasons to doubt whether this sort of theoretically
ambitious but selective evolutionary debunking strategy is a viable or
stable one (Kahane 2011 and 2014, Rini 2016, FitzPatrick 2017a). If
such debunking arguments really worked against opponents of
utilitarianism in the manner suggested, then similar arguments could
equally be deployed against utilitarianism if we play by the same
rules. The selective debunking arguments used by de Lazari-Radek and
Singer give major negative epistemic weight to the mere existence of
possible debunking explanations which, <em>if true</em>, would pose a
problem for the targeted beliefs (even though it remains an open
question whether such explanatory stories are actually true). That is,
they give great weight to the mere ability to <em>tell a plausible
debunking story</em> according to which non-utilitarian moral beliefs
would turn out to be rooted in &lsquo;contaminated starting
points&rsquo; (psychological dispositions resulting from morally blind
evolutionary forces) that have merely been refined over time by
cultural influences equally blind to moral truths. This raises
problems for them, however, because one can easily enough come up with
similar debunking stories about <em>utilitarian</em> beliefs,
according to which they would equally turn out to be problematically
shaped by morally-blind evolutionary forces that contaminated the
starting points.</p>

<p>
Here is just one way such a story could go (FitzPatrick 2017a).
Suppose that in early ancestral environments involving mostly small
in-group interactions, where there were few opportunities for
&lsquo;wasting&rsquo; altruistic tendencies on outsiders, natural
selection gave rise to some fairly <em>indiscriminate</em>
dispositions involving sympathy and altruism. As long as such
indiscriminate altruism contributed more to fitness in that
environment than it detracted from it through occasional
&lsquo;misfirings&rsquo; of such sentiments directed at
non-cooperators, it could very well have evolved as a simple
fitness-enhancing mechanism (Kitcher 2006b). Someone who wishes to
debunk impartial utilitarianism might then tell a story according to
which the utilitarian&rsquo;s impartial sympathy and concern is
nothing but an extension of this evolved psychological trait, whereby
it is systematically &lsquo;misfiring&rsquo; in our current
environment. More precisely, the story would be that current
utilitarian beliefs represent a cultural refinement of such evolved
tendencies <em>via</em> an application of reasoning, such as the
consistency reasoning utilitarians employ in arguing for an
&ldquo;expanding circle&rdquo; of moral concern and an increasingly
impartial altruism. The debunker will claim that however rational such
inferential steps may be in themselves, they are still just operating
on certain moral starting points that are &lsquo;contaminated&rsquo;
by evolutionary influence: namely, deeply ingrained moral intuitions
about the <em>intrinsic badness of suffering</em> wherever it occurs,
or the goodness of pleasure, which trace back to evolved psychological
dispositions to recoil at suffering and injury, or to feel sympathy
for others. Basic utilitarian moral intuitions, no less than
non-utilitarian intuitions, may ultimately be nothing but illusions
foisted on us by our evolutionary history, rooted in contaminated
starting points (Ruse 2006).</p>

<p>
Now de Lazari-Radek and Singer might wish to counter such debunking
attacks by claiming that even if there are such evolutionary
influences at the root of their intuitions about the badness of
suffering or the propriety of impartial altruism, the reflection and
reasoning that has taken place over centuries of moral inquiry has not
merely provided for more consistent applications of evolutionarily
contaminated dispositions: it has instead amounted to the intellectual
<em>discovery of good reasons</em> to believe the contents of
utilitarian moral claims to be <em>true</em>. This philosophical
possibility certainly remains on the table and hasn&rsquo;t been shown
not to obtain simply because an aspiring debunker can tell a debunking
story according to which it doesn&rsquo;t. And such a reply would
indeed be a plausible response to the debunker, making precisely the
point emphasized earlier in section 4.1. The problem, however, is that
if they are entitled to make this response to the debunker on behalf
of utilitarian moral beliefs, then so are their opponents on behalf of
non-utilitarian moral beliefs: what&rsquo;s good for the utilitarian
goose is good for the non-utilitarian gander.</p>

<p>
In other words, to escape evolutionary debunking themselves, it seems
that de Lazari-Radek and Singer will have to allow that the mere
existence of a possible evolutionary debunking explanation for a set
of moral beliefs does not undermine epistemic justification for them.
It matters whether or not that story <em>is actually the correct</em>
explanatory story, including its claim that the beliefs in question
are <em>exhaustively</em> accounted for simply in terms of the
morally-blind, extraneous causes in question, rather than partly
through rational grasp of good reasons for believing their contents to
be true; and merely being able to tell a debunking story does not
establish such a strong claim. Once this is recognized, however, the
same principle applies to just the sorts of debunking arguments they
have deployed against non-utilitarians, who can thus avoid them in the
same way.</p>

<h3><a name="EvoBioExp">4.3 Evolutionary Biology and Expressivism</a></h3>

<p>
A less ambitious claim made by some antirealists is that the account
in section 2.3 of the origins of our capacity for normative guidance
at least <em>lends support to</em> or <em>fits naturally with</em> an
<em>expressivist</em> metaethical view&mdash;the view that moral
judgments do not even purport to state moral facts, but instead
express non-cognitive states such as attitudes or acceptance of
certain norms, etc. (Gibbard 1990; Kitcher 2006a). Suppose the human
capacity for normative guidance is indeed an adaptation that evolved
in connection with social coordination, cooperation and stability.
This capacity involves <em>accepting a norm</em>, which we should thus
expect to be a standard part of human moral psychology and its
capacity for &ldquo;linguistically infused motivation&rdquo; (Gibbard
1990, 55). This may lend support to a norm-expressivist approach to
normative judgment, insofar as such an approach focuses precisely on
the notion of accepting a norm, and the evolutionary story provides
good reason to suppose that accepting a norm is a &ldquo;natural,
biological phenomenon&rdquo; (61).</p>

<p>
It is less clear, however, whether anything stronger than this can be
said. Suppose it&rsquo;s true that we evolved a capacity and tendency
for normative guidance because of the coordinating social function
achieved by the expression of norm acceptance. Not only does this
leave open what we <em>now</em> use that capacity to do, but it even
leaves open what exactly our ancestors did with it. One possibility is
that the activity they were engaged with was <em>non-cognitive</em>:
they were merely expressing non-cognitive states comprising attitudes
and states of norm acceptance. Kitcher (2006a) suggests that this is
the metaethical picture best supported by the evolutionary story. But
even granting that the <em>biological</em> function of moral judgment
is social coordination, the <em>linguistic</em> function of moral
judgments could go either way: it may be that the biological function
was carried out through non-cognitive expressions of norm acceptance,
but it could equally instead be that it was carried out through
<em>cognitive</em> judgments involving <em>claims to objective
validity</em>. Indeed, the social function might be all the better
served if those making moral judgments firmly believe in objective
values and assert those beliefs, even if they are in fact making a
projective error in doing so, as error theorists claim. Compare: even
if religious belief has a biological function (e.g., reducing
anxiety), it wouldn&rsquo;t follow that religious assertions are
non-cognitive and so aren&rsquo;t really assertions, and the story
might actually be more plausible if it is assumed that they
<em>are</em> genuine assertions (Joyce 2006, 175&ndash;76, 208; Ruse
2006).</p>

<p>
Thus, although the evolutionary story fits naturally with a merely
non-cognitivist or quasi-realist expressivist metaethical view, it may
fit equally well with a straightforwardly cognitivist view. If one
rejects the existence of moral truths, the latter would then lead to
an error theory (Mackie 1977). But as discussed in section 4.1, it is
far from clear how much support evolutionary biology itself lends to
moral anti-realism or irrealism. It is consistent with plausible
evolutionary stories that although our capacities for normative
guidance originally evolved for reasons that had nothing to do with
moral truths as such, we now regularly employ them to think and talk
about moral truths. All three metaethical views discussed
here&mdash;expressivism, error theory and moral realism&mdash;thus
remain on the table.</p>
