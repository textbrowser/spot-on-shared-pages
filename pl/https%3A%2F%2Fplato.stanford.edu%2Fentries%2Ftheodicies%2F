<h1>Theodicies</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Aug 8, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Stemming from <em>theos</em> (God) and <em>dike</em> (justice), a
theodicy is an attempt to show how the justice, goodness and other
features of God can be upheld in light of the evils in our world. As
such, theodicies suggest reasons for which God would cause or allow
the suffering, premature death, loss, and harm we experience and
observe, including genocides, illnesses, persistent pain, grief,
natural disasters, and assaults.</p>

<p>
Instances of suffering that seem to many people to be pointless (that
is, which seem as if there could be no God-justifying reason for
permitting them to occur), as well as the general facts about evil in
our world&mdash;including its vast amount, its uneven distribution,
and the intensity of suffering in truly horrid cases&mdash;pose a
powerful theoretical challenge to a theistic worldview. The divine
attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, and perfect goodness, in
particular, seem to indicate that there would not be any pointless
evils in the world, and they also seem to indicate that the facts of
evil would not be what they are. (For discussion of relevant arguments
from evil, see Rowe 1979, 1996; van Inwagen 2006; Oppy 2013; Speak
2015; Ekstrom 2021.)</p>

<p>
Providing an explanation of the reasons that justify God in permitting
the instances of evil in our world would enable the theodicist to
counter the claim that there are evils in the world for which there is
no God-justifying reason and so to block an influential argument from
pointless evils for atheism. And articulating God&rsquo;s reasons for
causing or allowing the facts of evil in our world would empower the
theodicist to counter the claim that, if God were to exist, then the
facts about evil in our world would not be what they are and, thus, to
block an argument from the facts about evil against the existence of
God.</p>

<p>
The remaining sections describe a wide variety of lines of theodicy
available in the literature on the problem of evil.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="RelaBuil">1. Relationship Building</h2>

<p>
One line of theodicy emphasizes the good of relationship building. On
this theodicy, God allows suffering so that we can become closer to
and bond with other created beings. When we experience loss, physical
pain, illness, and injury, we tend to become more aware of our shared
humanity and, as well, our shared sentience with non-human animals who
also experience pain and difficulty. Through enduring a natural
disaster with our neighbors, for instance, we may strengthen our sense
of community. Suffering can bring us together, as when individuals
assist each other in cooperative projects of rebuilding after a
hurricane destroys a vast amount of property. Shared tragedy and
disappointment serve to forge bonds between people: our relationships
with others can be strengthened when together we endure similar
hardships, such as a common medical diagnosis, when we offer each
other understanding, and when we do what we can to help lighten each
other&rsquo;s burdens. We ourselves may feel closer to people who are
attentive to us when we are ill or in grief, especially those who
genuinely listen, demonstrate their care, and offer their authentic
presence with us as we suffer. Highlights of one&rsquo;s life may come
in moments of feeling deeply understood by, and deeply understanding,
another person, and various types of loss and pain can serve to make
such empathetic connection possible. Some non-human animals, too, show
capacities for empathy and care, as well as efforts to help one
another.</p>

<p>
In short, on this line of theodicy, God permits pain and evils of
other kinds in virtue of their conduciveness to building and
strengthening interpersonal bonds and social relationships. Eleonore
Stump&rsquo;s work on the problem of evil highlights this theme,
suggesting that &ldquo;suffering can be redeemed for the sufferer in
personal relationship&rdquo; (2010: xix). Collins (2013) develops a
&ldquo;connection-building&rdquo; theodicy in this vein, which
emphasizes, in particular, the positive value of connections among
persons generated by virtuous responses to evil, including
sacrificially aiding another in time of suffering, helping another out
of moral and spiritual darkness, and forgiving and being forgiven. In
part due to the postulation that some such connections will last
forever as an ongoing part of the conscious experience of the
participants in them, Collins suggests that it is plausible to hold
that the positive value of connections formed through such virtuous
responses to evil &ldquo;outweigh both the finite evils of this life
along with any negative connections formed by unvirtuous
actions&rdquo; (such as the connections between rapists and victims)
(Collins 2013: 223).</p>

<p>
In order for the good of relationship building plausibly to serve as a
justifying reason for God to cause or permit cases of suffering we
observe in the world, the relationship building theodicist will need
to defend the contention that the strength and goodness of
relationships developed by the suffering in question not only was
worth it as an outweighing good but also was a good for which the
suffering was logically necessary. That is, the relationship building
theodicy will be plausible only for covering cases in which the good
of relational closeness could not have been brought about in any other
or better way. If Sarah could have become just as positively bonded
with and close to her friend Jos&eacute;, for instance, by sharing a
love of classical music as she did by sharing the experience of
trigeminal neuralgia with him, then the suffering and disability they
each endure from trigeminal neuralgia cannot be justified by its being
necessary for bringing about the good of their close friendship.
Likewise, if neighbors could have strengthened their sense of
community by way of a joyful block party just as well as by rebuilding
after a tornado, then the shared suffering from the natural disaster
cannot be justified by its being necessary for bringing about
strengthened community.</p>

<p>
Clearly not everyone becomes closer to others through suffering. Some
individuals become isolated, bitter, and mistrusting, more distant
from others as a result of the ways in which they have suffered, and
understandably so, since suffering is often at the hands of other
people. A relationship building theodicy thus seems best defended as
proposing the good of offering opportunities for developing positive
closeness to other persons or non-human animals, opportunities which
may or may not be freely taken. The relationship building theodicy
also faces the problem of being limited in scope, leaving out swaths
of cases including infants and toddlers who die prematurely, a vast
amount of non-human animal suffering, and cases in which illnesses,
such as neurodegenerative diseases, destroy persons&rsquo; capacities
for relationship. Thus the relationship building theodicy needs
supplementation by other lines of theodicy such as those considered in
subsequent sections.</p>

<h2 id="DiviIntiTheo">2. Divine Intimacy Theodicy</h2>

<p>
A related line of theodicy also focuses on the good of building
interpersonal closeness, but rather than focusing on relationships
among created beings, it emphasizes human relationships with God. On a
&ldquo;divine intimacy theodicy&rdquo; (Ekstrom 2004, 2013; Harris
2016), occasions of enduring tragedy, loss, and pain can provide
routes to knowing God, such that God is experienced in the midst of
suffering itself. This line of theodicy is suggested to an extent in
the work of Marilyn Adams and Eleonore Stump, as well as in the
writings of many mystics (Adams 1986, 1989, 1999; Stump 1985, 1994,
1999, 2010). Collins&rsquo;s connection-building theodicy also
incorporates relationships between human beings and spirituals beings,
including angels and God. See also Wolterstorff 1988. For critique of
the ways in which Stump, in particular, develops her theodicy, which
differs in some respects from others described in this section, see
Fales 2013.</p>

<p>
The core idea of the divine intimacy theodicy is that, through
suffering, we may become closer to God, experiencing God&rsquo;s
loving presence with us as we suffer, and perhaps even sharing in
God&rsquo;s own suffering (if God can suffer); and in our tragedies
and pain, we may gain acquaintance with God and rely more deeply on
God, allowing us to build intimacy of a spiritual kind with God.
Suffering itself may enable a fuller awareness of God&rsquo;s
existence and God&rsquo;s love for us. We find reports of visions of
God, as well as experiences of divine comfort in the midst of
suffering, in the writings of many religious thinkers: Simone Weil,
for example, describes experiences of being in pain when she felt that
God came down and took possession of her, so that she sensed in her
suffering the presence of divine love (Weil 1950 [1951]). Julian of
Norwich reports a divine vision while suffering a severe illness for
which she had received last rites (c. 1400 [1984: 66]) and recounts
that, in her suffering, she perceived God, sensing that God sheltered
and surrounded her with love (c. 1400 [1993: 88]). Many others have
likewise reported a divine vision or a sense of God&rsquo;s presence
in their distress, including Job, who, while suffering tremendous
losses, says to God, &ldquo;My ears had heard of you but now my eyes
have seen you&rdquo; (Job 42:5, NIV Bible). Nicholas Wolterstorff
writes about a period of grappling with the question of why God would
have allowed his young adult son to have fallen to his death in the
prime of his life: &ldquo;Through the prism of my tears&rdquo;, he
reports, &ldquo;I have seen a suffering God&rdquo; (1987:
80&ndash;81).</p>

<p>
The suggestion of the divine intimacy theodicy, in sum, is that God
allows us to suffer because this permits us to share in the experience
of God and enables us to experience God&rsquo;s presence and love in
vivid ways, thereby developing closeness between the sufferer and God.
Suffering thus could contribute positively to an individual&rsquo;s
relationship with God. While some religious thinkers reject the idea
that God suffers, since they view impassibility as an implication of
God&rsquo;s immutability, a theist in the Christian tradition might
see experiences in which he endures suffering as opportunities for
identification with the person of Jesus Christ, providing deeper
appreciation of his betrayal, sacrifice, and crucifixion. Marilyn
Adams (1999) suggests that even horrendous instances of suffering
might become meaningful by way of being woven into one&rsquo;s
relationship with God through identification with Christ, understood
either as sympathetic identification (in which each person suffers his
own pain, fostering empathy for, and understanding of, Christ) or as
mystical identification (in which the human sufferer literally
experiences a share of Christ&rsquo;s suffering). Michael Harris
argues that the divine intimacy theodicy is worthy of consideration as
part of a traditional Jewish theological approach to the problem of
suffering (Harris 2016).</p>

<p>
An objection to the divine intimacy theodicy is this: it is common
while suffering not to have a sense of closeness to God, but instead
to experience confusion, alienation, and anger. In fact, suffering,
especially prolonged and intense suffering, witnessed or experienced,
can be accompanied by a strong impression that God does not exist.
When devastated by loss, some of us may well feel utterly alone and
not in fact feel comforted by a perfect being who supposedly permitted
us to suffer as we do, in order for us to become closer to God. The
divine intimacy theodicist might reply that, from the fact that some
people reject God through suffering and do not feel God&rsquo;s loving
presence, it does not follow that occasions of suffering do not
provide opportunities for intimacy with God; but a divine intimacy
theodicist who wants to accommodate such cases by holding that the
sufferer freely failed to take advantage of the opportunity (so that
the non-achievement of the greater good is not God&rsquo;s fault),
would seem to need to add to this theodicy a defense of the existence
and positive value of free will.</p>

<p>
A second critical point is that intimacy with God is not available to
every being who suffers and so it seems that the divine intimacy
theodicy can provide at most a partial justificatory account. Problem
cases include the pain of non-human animals and the suffering of
infants and very young children, some born into deep poverty and
deprivation, some with debilitating illnesses, some who die slow
painful deaths through starvation, and some who are horrifically
mistreated. Additionally, even if, in such cases, the sufferers were
capable of intimacy with God, it is challenging to uphold the
perfections of God alongside the contention that such experiences are
logically necessary for the individuals who suffer to be close to God.
A critic might wonder why a perfect being would not bring about the
desired end in better ways or create beings who are full of a joyful,
loving direct acquaintance with God, living in union with God, without
their enduring tortures and pain.</p>

<h2 id="ContApprTheo">3. Contrast and Appreciation Theodicies</h2>

<p>
On a contrast line of theodicy, the central suggestion is that,
without evil, including suffering and wrongdoing, there could not be
good. The proposal is that good and evil must both exist; one of them
could not exist if the other did not exist to be a contrast to it. The
proponent might draw an analogy to light and darkness, or to mountains
and valleys, or to large and small. The reason God permits evils to
exist, on this theodicy, is that they are necessary for the existence
of goods.</p>

<p>
We should disentangle two different lines of thinking: one, a
metaphysical line of thought and, the other, an epistemological one.
The metaphysical line asserts that good and evil must both exist if
either one of them does. One cannot be real if the other is not real.
Problems for a &ldquo;necessity of contrast&rdquo; theodicy include
the point that it is inconsistent with traditional theism. Many
theists believe in heaven, a place or a type of existence in which
there is only goodness, joy, and peace, with no anguish or discord. It
seems clear that heaven can exist even if there is no hell (not all
believers in heaven believe in hell), and it seems clear that
heaven&mdash;a wholly good place or type of existence encompassing joy
and awe in the presence of the pure goodness of God&mdash;can exist
independently, even if there is no suffering in existence at all (or
any longer). Similarly, if it is coherent to envision a place of pure
harmony between human beings and other living things, including
harmony between human beings and God, with no natural disasters, no
illness, and no evil at all, such as in a Garden of Eden (prior to the
fall of the serpent or Satan), then good can exist without evil.
Likewise, billions of human beings say they believe in a perfect God
who created the universe, and part of this view is the idea that God
exists before the physical universe exists and that God exists
independently of the created universe. God exists always or
atemporally and would exist even if God had not created the physical
universe in which we live. If this belief about God is correct or even
coherent, then good can exist without evil.</p>

<p>
Justin McBrayer works to make the necessity of contrast suggestion
(which he calls the counterpart theodicy) more precise by
distinguishing different ideas the proponent might be making: one, the
existence of goodness requires that there exist some token of evil or
other in the universe; two, necessarily, for every instantiation of
good, there is a unique instantiation of evil; and three, necessarily,
for every instantiation of some types of goods, there is an
instantiation of evil. For reasons including those described above,
among others, McBrayer argues that, on each of these interpretations,
&ldquo;the counterpart theodicy is a failure&rdquo; (McBrayer 2013:
199).</p>

<p>
A theodicist might turn instead to expressing a second line of
thought&mdash;an epistemological one&mdash;which is connected but
somewhat different: namely that, if we human beings did not ever
suffer, then we would not appreciate the good aspects of life, such as
health, kindness, friendship, and love. On this appreciation theodicy,
it is not that evil must exist in order for good to exist, but rather
that evil has to exist in order for us to appreciate goodness. An
empirical observation in support of the appreciation line of thought
is that we often do take for granted our health and our abilities to
accomplish valuable tasks until we have suffered an illness or injury.
If we recover, many of us tend to appreciate our physical functioning
more richly than we did before. We may develop a greater sense of
well-being or an energized feeling of having a new lease on life after
going through a difficult time, and we appreciate the good in our
lives more than we would have, if we had not gone through some period
of pain or setback.</p>

<p>
An objection to the appreciation theodicy is that it does not
adequately answer the problem of why God would create beings who
suffer. The theological problem remains unsolved because God, as an
omnipotent and omniscient being, would appear to be able to create the
universe and the living beings in it in any way God pleases. Such a
being&mdash;one who is essentially perfectly powerful, perfectly good,
and perfectly knowledgeable&mdash;could have made living beings who do
not have the particular psychological tendency characterizing the
human beings described above, namely the tendency not to fully
appreciate good except when and after they suffer. God, instead, could
just as well make beings who richly savor their health and well-being
and who are filled with joy and appreciation for their loving
relationships and abilities, without their having to become sick or
injured or disabled at all. If human psychology is limited such that
we human beings underappreciate goodness until we experience badness,
then a perfect creator could simply create different beings, ones who
are fully appreciative of goodness all the time.</p>

<p>
Against the appreciation theodicy there is the additional point that,
if contrast were needed for appreciation of, for instance, good health
and full physical functioning, then a nightmare about losing
one&rsquo;s home in a natural disaster or a mildly bad dream about
catching a virus would be better than there being real injuries,
losses, and illnesses (van Inwagen 2006: 69); and atrocities on the
scale of the genocides and pandemics that mark the history of our
world are not necessary for appreciation of goods such as social
cooperation, kindness, and human dignity.</p>

<h2 id="CharDeveSoulMakiTheo">4. Character Development or Soul Making Theodicy</h2>

<p>
A distinctive line of theodicy deriving from the thought of the early
church father Ireneus (circa 130&ndash;202) and prominently advanced
by philosopher and theologian John Hick (1978) is referred to as the
&ldquo;soul making&rdquo; or &ldquo;character building&rdquo;
theodicy. The central suggestion of this theodicy is that God chose to
create us in a world that contains natural disasters, suffering, and
wrongdoing in order to help us grow in character, so that we become
better people, more godlike in character, through development over
time. Hick suggests that, as our perfectly loving and good Creator,
God wants us not to live in a hedonistic paradise in which our lives
are always pleasant, but instead to develop courage, tenacity,
generosity, patience, kindness, and other positive character traits
through the process of dealing with trials and losses. The justifying
reason for God&rsquo;s creating us in a world containing pain,
disappointments, and even horrific evils, then, is to offer us
opportunities to choose to respond to them in ways that make us more
virtuous, developing our characters or souls. If one were to see human
beings as inherently self-centered and unfit to be in the presence of
a holy God, then one might view the developmental process we undergo
while responding to suffering on Earth as one that enables us to
become fit to be in God&rsquo;s presence, a process that facilitates
our developing matured moral character so that we can enter
heaven.</p>

<p>
An accurate empirical observation relevant to the soul making theodicy
is that many people do tend to improve their characters through
enduring periods of suffering: they become more generous or
compassionate, less selfish, and less concerned about superficial
goods such as riches or fame. We human beings often do grow
spiritually or morally when we endure difficulty: we may gain an
expanded vision of the world, developing new empathy for people who
suffer in wars, poverty, and natural disasters. Those who may have
been mean-spirited or condescending toward others before becoming ill,
injured, or experiencing some injustice do sometimes become leaders of
positive movements for change and advocates for others&rsquo;
rights.</p>

<p>
A challenge for the character building theodicy is one akin to the
objection posed to the appreciation theodicy: namely, it seems that,
rather than requiring created beings to develop positive moral
character traits over time in a danger-filled environment in which
they are vulnerable to tragedies and loss, God could have, instead,
chosen to create beings who are, from the start, good, loving, and
morally mature. Consider the possibility that, if God desired to make
beings with whom God could enjoy relationships of shared love and joy,
God might have created us already &ldquo;fit&rdquo; to be in
God&rsquo;s presence, since there seems to be no logical requirement
on the creation of rational beings that they must be, by nature, cruel
or selfish, or ones who need to struggle through suffering and loss in
order to develop positive character traits.</p>

<p>
Hick responds to this objection by saying that, in his judgment, good
character traits acquired in a temporally-extended process through
responses to struggle and suffering are more valuable than are the
good character traits which, in the hypothetical alternative, God
could have given us instead: ones possessed not by way of moral
development in a world filled with trauma and tragedy (Hick 1978:
256). There appears to be some tension between Hick&rsquo;s claim that
acquired virtues are better than other virtues and the view that
God&rsquo;s virtues are not acquired. Further work on assessing
Hick&rsquo;s value judgment would be welcome.</p>

<p>
Another objection to the soul making theodicy is the observation that,
although some individuals do become, for instance, more generous after
experiencing poverty, or more perseverant through suffering chronic
pain, many other individuals do not. Some who suffer simply become
discouraged, angry, or despondent. Hick has a reply here, too, which
is that his claim is not that every instance of suffering in fact
produces character growth, but instead that a world like ours offers
created beings opportunities to freely respond to setbacks and
suffering by intentionally developing their characters in positive
ways. If we become even more selfish, bitter, or indifferent through
suffering of our own or witnessing that of others, that is not
God&rsquo;s fault but ours. This emphasis on the divine offer of
opportunities for, rather than guarantees of, positive moral
development highlights the reliance of Hick&rsquo;s character building
theodicy on the assertion that God gave created beings the ability to
choose freely among available options regarding how to act, including
the opportunity to respond badly.</p>

<p>
One might continue to press an objection with respect to people who do
not grow through suffering. Whereas Hick maintains that evil provides
opportunities for freely chosen virtuous response, some examples in
human experience clearly do not to provide any opportunity for
character development to those who suffer, including those who die
prematurely, such as young children and infants who suffer fatal
diseases and die in accidents, and adults who pass away suddenly of
strokes and heart attacks, leaving them no chance to grow in character
(Puccetti 1967). Some kinds of traumas, too, are wholly devastating to
those who undergo them, and it seems wrong to blame them by saying
that their traumatic experiences gave them opportunities for virtuous
character development of which they themselves failed to take
advantage if it was not possible, physically or psychologically, for
them to do so in their circumstances. A critic might raise, in
addition, the severe and inhumane violence inflicted on human beings
during the transatlantic slave trade, and on victims of the Holocaust,
and on those who suffer unspeakable child abuse, arguing that it is
simply not credible that God permits the occurrence of such horrors so
that the victims have opportunities to positively develop their souls
or characters.</p>

<p>
The theodicist could respond to this objection, as Richard Swinburne
(1998: 101) does (as part of his multi-faceted theodicy), by
suggesting that the victims in such horrible cases as the
transatlantic slave trade were given by God the good of <em>being of
use</em> as the vehicle of a good purpose. This good purpose could be,
for instance, providing <em>other</em> individuals with opportunities
to freely respond in virtuous ways so as to improve their own
characters. One might view this position as implausible, as Ekstrom
(2021) argues, in virtue of its depicting God as violating appropriate
moral constraints, such as respect for the inherent dignity and value
of each individual person, particularly in instances in which
&ldquo;being of use&rdquo; is non-voluntary. Arguably preserving the
goodness of God requires that the suffering of victims be good for
them, and the alleged good of being of use is not sufficiently good
for the victims of such evils as genocides, slave trades, pandemics,
and sexual abuse to provide a God-justifying reason for permitting
their suffering. This requirement is known in the literature on the
problem of evil as a victim-centered constraint on plausible
theodicies and, while it is not agreed to by all theists, it strikes
many as a reasonable moral judgment that applies to a perfectly good
and loving God who created and cares for each of us (Stump 1985:
411&ndash;413). The critic could continue that, even if
victim-centered constraints on theodicies were rejected, the character
building theodicist should provide further defense of the suggestion
that the good of opportunities for other people&rsquo;s character
development enabled by the suffering of victims outweighs the negative
value of the victims&rsquo; suffering.</p>

<p>
Even if, for some instances of suffering in our world, the justifying
reason for which God permits them to occur is that they offer to
victims opportunities for character improvement, still when we view
the extent, range, and intensity of atrocities in our world, it does
not seem plausible to think that all of them can be accounted for on
such grounds. Like the other theodicies we have examined thus far, the
character building theodicy needs supplementation by other lines of
theodicy in order to account for the facts about evil in our
world.</p>

<h2 id="PuniForSin">5. Punishment for Sin</h2>

<p>
Consider the predicament of Sisyphus, who toils in an endless cycle of
rolling a giant boulder up a hill only for it, upon reaching the top,
to roll back down again: his plight is depicted in Greek mythology as
a matter of divine punishment for his sins of deceit and impiety. Many
of us ask ourselves what we (or others) have done wrong to deserve to
suffer as we (or they) do, showing implicit reliance on the idea that
suffering comes our way as punishment. We see illustration of the
punishment theodicy in the mouths of various companions in the book of
Job, who urge Job to repent of his wrongdoing and plead to God for
forgiveness. Their suggestion is that Job suffers as he does, with
sores, anguish, and the destruction of his property and family,
because he is at fault, illustrating the idea that those who suffer
have done something wrong to deserve it and if they would repent,
their suffering would cease.</p>

<p>
The idea that some evil is penalty is offered as a theodicy
prominently in the work of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, who each
suggest that some of the evils in our world constitute punishments for
human sin. Augustine viewed evil not as an entity that has being in
itself, although this does not mean that evil is illusory&mdash;people
do suffer, and people do sin, he acknowledged. Rather, as Augustine
conceived of it, evil is not a substance that makes up part of the
universe (<em>Confessions</em> VII.12.18 [1977: 174]). Still, evil as
a privation (or lack of goodness) exists: it exists as damage,
degradation, or defect. The question remains: why would God permit
anyone to be vulnerable to damage, degradation, or defect? On
Augustine&rsquo;s view, damage, degradation and defect originate in
the world from the wrong use of the free will, a power given by God to
finite created beings, including human beings, and all of humanity is
guilty of sin and merits condemnation through the fall of humankind in
the original sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (<em>De
Civitate Dei</em> 12.1&ndash;9 [1950: xiii, 14]). Aquinas calls
privation of form and integrity in free creatures &ldquo;evil of
penalty&rdquo;, because he, also, saw these privations as penalties
resulting both from original sin and personal sin, and because the
privations have a characteristic feature of punishment in being
contrary to the will of the afflicted person. Privation of due
operation performed voluntarily Aquinas calls &ldquo;evil of
fault&rdquo; since he sees agents as being at fault for the defect in
their free acts; and he views evil of fault as worse than evil of
penalty (Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologica</em> 1.49.6).</p>

<p>
Richard Swinburne (1998) suggests that punishment is one good that
could justify God in permitting the suffering of human beings, though
his approach to theodicy is multi-dimensional, broader than an appeal
only to divine punishment. Swinburne holds that it is good that God
provides human beings with deterrents to sin because they are weak and
in need of encouragement to act in ways that are objectively good,
which at the start may involve punishment for acting badly. He
writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
parents and other educators encourage good behavior by threats and
rewards as a preliminary to children learning to do good for its own
sake. And it would be good for God to do the same. (Swinburne 1998:
198)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that here punishment is depicted more as something useful for
moral conditioning than it is depicted as retribution that is
deserved.</p>

<p>
Some find a punishment line of theodicy attractive when holding in
mind considerations of justice in relation to horrific actions of
crime and violence, the thought being that God would rightfully punish
wrongdoers in this life or the afterlife for the suffering they have
inflicted on their victims. A bare punishment theodicy, though, is
incomplete, since the theodicist needs to explain God&rsquo;s
justification for allowing not only suffering but also wrongdoing.
Another problem is that we observe many cases of individuals who
cannot, for all we can tell, deserve the suffering they endure: cases
of inherited genetic diseases, for instance, childhood cancers,
abusive injuries to children, and non-human animal suffering both in
the wild and from human cruelty. In our knowledge of history and our
observations of the world around us, we do not see justice in the
quality or length of the lives of rational and sentient beings. Some
compassionate, kind, and generous people suffer immensely and
repeatedly. Many find the suggestion that some victims suffer
involuntarily as punishment for the sins of others not compelling.</p>

<h2 id="FreeWillTheo">6. Free Will Theodicy</h2>

<p>
With respect to the question of the justification of pain, cruelty,
and other evils in relation to God, it is important to acknowledge the
significant role played in theistic thought by appeal to the power of
human free choice. We have seen above that many of the theodicies on
offer rely on it. One prominent way to defend the goodness and other
perfections of God in response to the evils of the world is to point
out that, after all, God did not bring about the Rwandan genocide or
the Holocaust or someone&rsquo;s sexual assault. Instead, these were
caused by human actions, which the theist may suggest were freely
chosen by perpetrators. On the free will theodicy, God remains an
absolutely perfect being even in light of the suffering in the world,
because it is created beings who freely choose to harm each other (and
non-human animals and the environment), and none of this is
God&rsquo;s direct doing. What goes wrong in our world is not the
fault of God but rather the fault of the wrongdoers who use their
power of free will to act badly. The free will theodicist holds that
it is a great good that God gave us free will and allows us direct the
course of our lives by way our own free choices (Swinburne 1998). The
result of the gift of free will to the billions of people on the
planet is a whole lot of bad consequences from evil choices, which God
is justified in allowing because of the greater good of the gift of
free will.</p>

<p>
Several problems face the line of thought that lays all the blame for
the pain and suffering in the world on the bad free choices of created
beings. One problem is this: even in cases of free actions that cause
harm, if God is in control of the universe, then God at least
<em>allows</em> the harm to be freely done to the victims by the
perpetrators. God&rsquo;s omnipotence indicates that God could have
intervened to prevent a bad choice and could have intervened after the
choice to prevent its most harmful consequences. God could cause
someone who intends to rape to twist his ankle and fall to the ground,
for instance, or to get violently ill, or faint, preventing the
intended victim&rsquo;s assault. In answer to the question of why God
did not do that, there must be some good reason. Preserving the
stability of natural laws is a good that is sometimes suggested here.
(For relevant discussion see Swinburne 1998 and for a contrary view
see Sterba 2019.)</p>

<p>
Another problem for the free will theodicy is that not all cases of
suffering are brought about intentionally by human free choices, such
as damage in the wake of hurricanes and the ravages of inherited
diseases. Bad medical outcomes in surgical cases, too, do not always
result from malicious intent or professional negligence. When a
tornado rips through a town destroying some homes and not others, no
human being freely chose for certain houses rather than neighboring
ones to be destroyed, and no human being freely brought about the
tornado in the first place.</p>

<p>
Another difficulty facing the free will theodicy is this: whereas some
philosophers think that free will would be ruled out by the truth of
causal determinism (the hypothesis that at each moment there is
exactly one future, given the laws of nature and the events of the
past), other free will theorists believe that we can act freely even
if causal determinism is true. Arguably it is crucial that the free
will appealed to by a free will theodicist must be indeterminist
(libertarian) in nature. (For exploration of indeterminist accounts of
free will, see Clarke 2003; Ekstrom 2000, 2019; Franklin 2018; Kane
1996; Mele 2006; O&rsquo;Connor 2000.) The free will theodicist thus
must maintain that all compatibilist accounts of the nature of free
agency, including those provided by Frankfurt (1971), Watson (1975),
Fischer (2012), Nelkin (2011), and Wolf (1990), among others, are
implausible accounts. In citing the free will of created beings as the
greater good that justifies God in permitting instances of evil or the
facts about evil, the free will theodicist also needs to hold that
causal determinism is, in fact, false and that we human beings do have
libertarian free will. Without maintaining these positions, the free
will theodicist lacks an explanation for the violence and cruelty in
the world that shields God and preserves God&rsquo;s goodness, since
God could have established the initial conditions of the universe and
decreed that deterministic natural laws govern all events, so that the
events in the world unfolded to include none that are painful, harmful
or wrong. God could have done this even in worlds in which he created
free (in a compatibilist sense) rational beings.</p>

<p>
Here is an additional problem for the theodicy according to which
God&rsquo;s allowance of suffering is due to God&rsquo;s desire to
create beings with libertarian free will and to allow creatures to
carry out their evil intentions as well as their good ones: such
morally significant libertarian free will (in Alvin Plantinga&rsquo;s
(1974) terms)&mdash;or what Swinburne (1998) calls <em>serious</em>
free will, which is libertarian free will with respect to seriously
good and seriously evil potential actions&mdash;must have immense
positive value, in order for it to be sensible to think that a perfect
being would decide to create beings with that power. The claim that
such serious libertarian free will is <em>worth it</em> stands in need
of convincing defense. (This issue is addressed in detail in Ekstrom
2021.) Notice that there is a difference between a proposed causal
explanation of evil and a divine justification for allowing evil. If
the causal explanation for a vast range of cases of evil in our world
is human free will, then still, in order to serve as a God-justifying
reason for permitting those evils, it has to be a very great
outweighing good for God to create beings with serious morally
significant free will and not to intervene to prevent the consequences
of their wrong choices.</p>

<h2 id="AppeAfte">7. Appeal to the Afterlife</h2>

<p>
In attempting to identify goods that justify God in permitting the
evils of the world, naturally theists might suggest that we should not
be limited only to goods available to rational and sentient beings
during their earthly lives. From a broader perspective that includes
the history and future of the universe, the time each of us spends on
Earth is rather brief, and the goods that justify God in permitting
the evils we endure during our earthly life spans might well be goods
that exist beyond that limited time frame. We have already considered
appeal to the goods of empathetic and supportive connections with
other rational and sentient beings, and loving relationship and
growing intimacy with God; and a theist can suggest that these goods
might well last into an afterlife. (Collins&rsquo; connection-building
theodicy discussed in
 <a href="#RelaBuil">section 1</a>
 incorporates this idea, as do Marilyn Adams&rsquo; and Eleonore
Stump&rsquo;s suggestions discussed in
 <a href="#DiviIntiTheo">section 2</a>.)
 The plausibility of the claim that there is an afterlife depends in
part on one&rsquo;s views about the nature of existing sentient beings
and one&rsquo;s views about what God could do with respect to
preserving personal identity through earthly death. One might grant
that we do not know for certain that there is no afterlife and that it
is logically possible that the lives of some or all rational and
sentient creatures continue after their earthly deaths. On a number of
religious traditions, there is an afterlife existence that involves
eternal joy, freedom from pain and loss, rich and everlasting love, or
glorious union with God.</p>

<p>
What we suffer while on Earth is finite in duration. If after earthly
death, individuals in heaven enjoy continued loving, blissful
relationships with God and other persons for eternity, then the
enormity and depth of the joy and love experienced in the afterlife
would so far surpass in goodness what we have experienced during
earthly life that our present experiences might be seen as pale and
insignificant. The theodicist appealing to afterlife goods might
suggest that our finitely endured earthly periods of suffering are
simply overwhelmed or swamped by the magnificently great good of an
infinite heavenly existence. We might call this view, following
Stephen Maitzen (2009), a &ldquo;Heaven Swamps Everything&rdquo;
theodicy.</p>

<p>
One might fill in an afterlife theodicy in different ways. One might
suggest, for instance, that in heaven a person will no longer care
about what she endured on Earth, or it will seem trivial to her from
the heavenly perspective; or one might contend that, in heaven, people
will not complain about the disappointments and losses they
experienced in the past, no matter how tragic they were at the time,
and will accept them, given their state of eternal bliss in the
presence of God. Or the suggestion could be that in heaven people will
have forgotten about what they endured or that, although they recall
their suffering, they forgive those who caused it. Or one might
suggest that in the afterlife people will come to see their earthly
pains as simply overwhelmed by the great goodness of heavenly
existence, which serves as compensation for them. The afterlife
theodicist could say that several of these ideas are true. The core
point is that heavenly existence is such a surpassingly great good
that earthly sufferings are, in the scope of things, insignificant,
and all suffering is compensated for or somehow &ldquo;defeated&rdquo;
or &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; by God in an eternal heavenly experience
after earthly death. Stephen T. Davis, for instance, writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
People will be able to look back from the perspective of the kingdom
of God and see that their past sufferings, no matter how severe,
prolonged, or undeserved, have been overcome and no longer matter.
(Davis 2001: 84)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Elsewhere, Davis suggests that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Holocaust, like all other evils (so I believe), will be redeemed
in the sense that some day it will no longer be a source of suffering
(even in memory); it will fade away, pale into insignificance. (Davis
2004: 272)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that the afterlife theodicist should not assert that, in light
of heaven, our earthly pains are nothing; a right reply is that this
statement is false, since the loss of one&rsquo;s child to a
devastating disease is not nothing, sexual assault is not nothing, and
the endurance of persistent neuropathic pain over the span of decades
is not nothing. These pains, losses, and assaults are real, and even
if there is a blissful eternal afterlife, the individuals who endure
the death of a child, sexual assault, and chronic pain while they live
on earth do indeed experience devastating pain. The question remains:
what justifies God in causing or allowing such experiences of
suffering by people God loves? Clearly compensation is not
justification (Maitzen 2009: 122). An abusive parent who later gives a
child the gift of toys after a violent episode toward her does not
provide any justification for what he did to her, and he does not
thereby provide an explanation or an apology, but merely tries to
somehow to make up for what he put her through. Being granted eternal
bliss and union with God in an afterlife is obviously not akin to
being given a token gift of toys. Still, if one person endures a
brutal racist assault on earth and another does not, and both end up
in heaven, it is fair to ask why God allowed the first to be assaulted
but spared the second, and why God elects to create a universe in
which brutal racist assaults take place at all.</p>

<p>
We should notice, as well, that the doctrine of hell poses a
complication for a theodicy that appeals to goods in the afterlife.
Some have argued that the view according to which some persons suffer
eternally in hell presents a particularly virulent argument from evil
(Lewis 2007; Ekstrom 2021) In light of its reliance on an unobserved
heavenly existence, the afterlife theodicy is also not particularly
helpful in moving a non-theist to deny crucial premises in central
arguments from evil.</p>

<h2 id="FeliCulpTheo">8. Felix Culpa Theodicy</h2>

<p>
One line of theodicy available in Christian thought on the problem of
evil is developed by Alvin Plantinga, who highlights God&rsquo;s
incarnation in taking on human form and atonement in dying by
crucifixion as punishment for humanity&rsquo;s sins (and subsequent
rising from the dead). Plantinga suggests that God&rsquo;s ultimate
aim is to create a world of a certain level of value, which</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
requires that he aim to create a world in which there is incarnation
and atonement&mdash;which, in turn, requires that there be sin and
evil. (Plantinga 2004: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With the title of the theodicy referring to happy fault or the
fortunate or blessed fall of humanity into sin, Plantinga offers that
&ldquo;the Felix Culpa approach can perhaps provide us with a
theodicy&rdquo; (2004: 14). The suggestion is that wrongdoing and
suffering in our world are justified by way of their being necessary
for the immense good of salvation by way of divine incarnation and
atonement (Plantinga 2004: 9).</p>

<p>
It is interesting to weigh our intuitions: is it better to live in
harmony with God and with other created beings for all eternity, and
to love and be loved by God, with a kind of freedom that is not
serious morally significant free will (harmony and love which
Plantinga grants are possible without sin or the ability to sin [2004:
10&ndash;11]) <em>or</em> to live in a world with heinous evils, a
fall of humankind into sin and disorder, and in which there is, by
hypothesis, salvation by way of divine atonement? (Notice that it is
atonement, and not incarnation, that requires freely chosen
wrongdoing, by the very nature of atonement: there would be no need
for atonement if there were not wrongdoing as a response to which
atonement is called for.) Plantinga holds that the latter is better
than the former. In support of the judgment, he not only emphasizes
the good of divine atonement but also maintains that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
creatures that have a great deal of power, including power to do both
good and evil, are more valuable than creatures who are free, but
whose power is limited or meager, (2004: 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
which concurs with Swinburne (1998). He adds that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
by virtue of our fall and subsequent redemption, we can achieve a
level of intimacy with God that can&rsquo;t be achieved in any other
way. (2004: 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So on the Felix Culpa theodicy, the final condition of human
beings</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is <em>better than</em> it is in the worlds in which there is no fall
into sin but also no incarnation and redemption. (2004: 25, italics
added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The way Plantinga spells out that final condition is this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
they receive God&rsquo;s thanks, enjoy a greater intimacy with him,
are invited to join that charmed circle [of the Trinity], (2004:
25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
echoing themes in the divine intimacy and afterlife theodicies.
Assessment of the plausibility of the Felix Culpa theodicy will depend
on one&rsquo;s evaluation of the key value claims highlighted in this
section, in relation to the particular cases of evil, and the facts
about evil, in our world.</p>

<h2 id="HybrTheo">9. Hybrid Theodicy</h2>

<p>
If each of the theodicies available in the literature remains limited
in scope, the question remains of whether or not, collectively, they
might successfully cover the general facts about evil in our world and
each instance of evil in our world, so that no instance of evil is
pointless. That is, a theist might offer a hybrid theodicy, proposing
that God is justified in causing or allowing some cases of suffering
as punishment for sin, while the justification for the permission of
other cases is their offering opportunities for character development;
and certain other instances provide chances for developing the
sufferer&rsquo;s relationship with God; and other instances of
suffering are justified in virtue of providing opportunities to build
positive human relationships; and other cases are justified in virtue
of being necessary for a person&rsquo;s admission to a heavenly
afterlife or for a particularly wonderful quality of afterlife
experience; and others are a result of serious morally significant
libertarian free will and original sin which God is justified in
creating and permitting for some great good, perhaps the intrinsic or
extrinsic good of the power of serious morally significant free will
itself, perhaps including its necessity for there being divine
atonement. This strategy faces conceptual challenges noted in sections
above, along with the difficulty of accounting for instances of evil
for which there simply seems to be no point. Some individuals endure
suffering throughout their lifetimes, including infants born with
incurable diseases whose lives are painful and cut short, and others
who spend decades in daily intractable pain. Some suffer misfortune
upon misfortune in the form of injuries, poor surgical outcomes,
betrayals of trust, loneliness, poverty, injustice, and other losses
that pile on. The horrendous suffering on the scale of the genocides,
pandemics, wars, and abuse that mark our history, too, challenge the
plausibility of a collective or hybrid theodicy. It is difficult to
identify a convincing reason, or even set of reasons, that could
justify a perfect God in causing or allowing the instances of evil,
and the facts about evil, we observe in our world.</p>

<h2 id="AntiTheo">10. Anti-theodicy</h2>

<p>
Some philosophers and theologians have urged that the project of
theodicy itself is defective in important respects, morally suspect or
even wrong (Roth 2001, 2004; Surin 1986; Trakakis 2008, 2013).
Crucially, theodicy should not deny the reality of evil or minimize
its impact on victims. A defender of the project of theodicy might say
that it is important for those who endorse a hypothesis facing
recalcitrant data to explore auxiliary hypotheses that aim to account
for that data in terms of the hypothesis in question. Still, it is
important to notice that offering the proposed divine justifications
for permitting suffering reviewed above, in certain contexts, can
cause harm. For instance, it can add to the suffering of a person who
lives with persistent pain, or someone who suffers a chronic illness,
or a survivor of trauma, to be told by a religious leader, friend, or
stranger that &ldquo;God chose you for this painful experience&rdquo;
or &ldquo;everything happens for a reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;in order to
be unburdened from your pain, you need to forgive someone&rdquo;.
Certain theodicies suggest that sufferers are to blame for their own
suffering&mdash;such as the punishment theodicy&mdash;while others
encourage us to look for other people to blame&mdash;such as the free
will theodicy, in its focus on human wrongdoing&mdash;and others imply
that those who suffer do not have sufficiently virtuous character
traits and so are being refined in moral character or offered chances
to improve themselves as they suffer&mdash;such as the character
development theodicy. The suggestion that victims suffer so that
<em>other</em> people may develop into more empathetic or helpful
people, or in order to realize greater communal heavenly joy, does not
explain how God could be treating victims themselves with dignity and
respect and not only using them as means to an end. When we critically
assess those who are in poverty or incurable pain as at fault, judging
that they must be acting wrongly or else God would not permit them to
suffer, we take a position of morally superiority with respect to
them, which can be cruel; and when we fail to hold in mind that all of
us are, at any moment, susceptible to diseases, accidents, and
disabling injuries, we lack humility and an appropriate sense of
commonality. As we suffer ourselves, and as we live in a world filled
with human and non-human animal suffering on a vast scale, care seems
to be called for regarding how we justify pain, distress, and tragedy
in relation to God.</p>
