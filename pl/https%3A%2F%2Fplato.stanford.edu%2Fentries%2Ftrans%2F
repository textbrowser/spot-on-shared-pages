<h1>Trans Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Oct 8, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Trans philosophy is an emergent subfield of philosophy that concerns
trans experiences, histories, cultural production, and politics.
Through the lens of trans lives, the field reconsiders questions
traditional to philosophy (e.g., questions of ontology, identity,
knowledge, and power) and generates new questions that expand
philosophy in multiple directions, especially enhancing our
understanding of gender in relation to abolitionist movements,
colonialism, disability, ecology, medicalization, law, misogyny, and
violence. As with any philosophical subfield tethered to a
marginalized community, trans philosophy offers a fundamental critique
of philosophy as it has been traditionally practiced and,
correlatively, offers new concepts and methods for the field. For
trans philosophy, trans is not just a topic or an exotic puzzle. Trans
modifies communities to which trans philosophy needs to be
accountable. Trans is also a way of seeing the world and of engaging
crossways and sideways with its (especially, but not only,
cisheteronormative) discursive and material structures (that is,
structures that privilege non-trans, non-queer people in advance).
Tethered to trans communities and trans methods, trans philosophy is a
critical project that is also an accountable and illuminative one.</p>

<p>
Trans philosophy has developed as a critical project in the critical
theory sense of the term. That is, trans philosophy is not merely a
negative project of undoing or criticizing, in any simple sense, but
is rather an illuminative project of identifying both conditions of
possibility and pathways for alternative possibilities. Pressing far
beyond the simplistic questions of &ldquo;What is gender?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Is a trans woman a woman?&rdquo; which have consumed much of
philosophical inquiry around trans issues, trans philosophy sets to
work exploring trans experiences themselves and how they intersect
with institutional structures. On the one hand, experiential critique
involves analyzing how we make sense of our worlds. It therefore
plumbs, especially from a trans/feminist perspective, the
epistemological, phenomenological, historical, and ontological
quandaries of trans life. On the other hand, institutional critique
involves analyzing how we intersect with social structures and their
histories. Here, colonialism, the medical industrial complex, the
prison industrial complex, juridical systems, global surveillance
systems, capitalism, social reproduction, and law, as well as material
structures of transphobic violence and erasure, all take center stage.
Through the complementary vectors of experiential and institutional
critique, trans philosophy has the capacity to illuminate the ins and
outs of trans existence.</p>

<p>
This entry begins by offering context and background for what
&ldquo;trans&rdquo; means and how the term has developed in
relationship with other gender categories (e.g., FTM, MTF, intersex,
cisgender, and nonbinary) and gender norms (e.g., as formed by
whiteness and ablebodymindedness). The entry then turns to offer
metaphilosophical reflections on the nature of trans philosophy,
followed by a brief history of it. The bulk of the entry is then spent
sketching the practices of experiential and institutional critique
central to the trans philosophical project. Finally, the entry closes
with a rumination on the future of trans philosophy. The challenge of
critique is not only to analyze and reimagine conditions of
possibility, but also to put the inquirer and the inquiry itself into
question. As it faces its future(s) and insofar as it is a critical
project, trans philosophy will&nbsp;keep its epistemological methods,
philosophical subjects, and, perhaps most importantly, itself open to
reconsideration and reconstruction.</p>

<h2 id="ContBack">1. Context and Background</h2>

<p>
Before one can have a clear understanding of what trans philosophy is,
it is helpful to have an understanding of what &ldquo;trans&rdquo; is.
According to a common trans studies&rsquo; definition,
<em>transgender</em> refers to any &ldquo;movement away from an
assigned, unchosen gender position&rdquo; and encompasses &ldquo;any
and all kinds of variation from gender norms and expectations&rdquo;
(Stryker 2008b: 19 [2017]). Already, however, philosophical questions
arise. Can an English term from the mid-twentieth century be applied
to all gender disruptors across eras and geographies? What, if
anything, distinguishes everyday gender deviations from those
exceptional&nbsp;or otherwise significant ones that seem to warrant
the &ldquo;trans&rdquo; category? What differences does the term
<em>trans</em>, and the category of transgender, illuminate and what
does it hide? These are the kinds of questions that trans philosophy,
as a truly critical project, is&nbsp;concerned with. Such concerns,
however, are not new. The contestation of what trans means and what
inquiries it can therefore circumscribe have been long in the making,
stretching from early butch/FTM border wars and the womyn&rsquo;s
movement to the challenges that class, disability, and race, for
example, pose to its defining contours.</p>

<h3 id="EarlGendWars">1.1 Early Gender Wars</h3>

<p>
In the 1990s, the term <em>trans&nbsp;</em>expanded in a storm. From
the start, trans people had to defend their relationship to
established gender categories, especially of woman and lesbian. FTMs
(female-to-male) transsexual and transgender people were typically
considered traitors to those categories, while MTFs (male-to-female)
were considered invaders. The larger trans exclusionary radical
feminist context that fueled the Michigan Womyn&rsquo;s Festival, as
well as scholars Bernice Hausman (1995) and Janice Raymond (1979),
informed leading feminist philosophers such as Claudia Card (1996).
The simultaneous&nbsp;butch/FTM border wars put in question whether
trans masculinity could be anything but patriarchal and problematic.
The logic proceeded as follows. If, and insofar as, trans men are men
(especially straight men), they have abandoned women and sided with
the enemy. And if and insofar as trans women were born men (especially
straight men), they are still on the side of the enemy and greedily
presuming access to the category woman too. Whatever it meant to do
feminist philosophy and queer philosophy, then, it did not mean to
take trans experiences seriously as illuminative of the fundamental
issues with which those subfields were concerned. Early work in queer
and trans feminism (Halberstam 1998a, 1998b; Hale 1998; Prosser,
1998), stemming from the conviction that queer, trans, and feminist
theory addressed the same troubling gender structures, began to turn
this tide.</p>

<p>
But the trans community had internal turmoil all its own. In the
1990s, self-described transvestites, cross-dressers, and transsexuals
dominated trans organizing. In both cases, an increasingly purist set
of standards governed who could count as trans and who could not. In
the case of transvestites, for example, it was those who only dressed
for pleasure and successfully passed when doing so, whereas in the
case of transsexuals it was those who underwent genital reconstruction
and hormone replacement therapy and successfully passed thereafter.
Frustrated by those standards, a range of gender nonconforming people
started to propose new terms for themselves, including bigender,
intergender, metagender, third gender, transgender, etc. It was
transgender that stuck. As conceptualized at the time,
&ldquo;transgender&rdquo; did not require any specific set of
practices, identifications, or embodiments in order for someone to
count as &ldquo;really&rdquo; transgender (Stone 1987). Rather, it
opened an umbrella space for a variety of kinds of gender deviance and
gender play to collect and struggle together for trans liberation
(Feinberg 1996: x). Of course, there is a danger of <em>trans</em>, as
an Anglophone and US-centric term, colonizing all manner of gender
disruptors it has no business claiming. In its best sense, trans
welcomes anyone who would claim the term, but does not itself claim
all those who could. It is a term of use, rather than definition, and
a term of movement rather than essence.</p>

<p>
At the time, &ldquo;trans&rdquo; was also entangled with the growing
intersex movement (Chase 1998). From the 1990s onward, the case of
John Money&rsquo;s earlier intersex surgical interventions and gender
reassignments fed discussion of (trans)gender experience (cf. Butler
2004b). The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) (2008&mdash;see
Other Internet Resources) insists, however, on a staunch distinction
between trans and intersex people, a position some intersex studies
scholars maintain (Karkazis 2008; Feder 2014). Other scholars and
activists, however, including Banti Jaswal, Emi Koyama, and Pidgeon
Pagonis, connect the two explicitly (Fausto-Sterling 2000 [2020];
Malatino 2019). The comparisons are myriad. Intersex people do not
typically have a choice about surgery and treatment, whereas trans
people do but often cannot get approved (Holmes 2008: 45&ndash;46;
Dreger 1998: 261n80). Both trans and intersex people, however, and
certainly trans intersex people, put the lie to the binary sex/gender
system (Kessler 1998: 121&ndash;122). Both are subject to similar
teratological narratives and processes of becoming (Malatino 2019,
2022), enough that Riki Wilkins, of Transexual Menace, suggested trans
and intersex people meet on the grounds of menacing (Kessler 1998:
122). Both movements, moreover, have availed themselves of the
framework of identity politics and coming-out narratives (Preves 2003:
88). Despite their divergent histories, theorizing trans and intersex
coalitionally is an underdeveloped project and requires correlative
philosophies of sex and gender, structural oppression and resistance,
medicalization and bodily autonomy (Wolff, Rubin, &amp; Swarr [eds.]
2022).</p>

<h3 id="CisgNonb">1.2 Cisgender and Nonbinary</h3>

<p>
As trans theory grew, debates about what &ldquo;trans&rdquo; means
could expand beyond its relation to older terms and start to encompass
terms generated within trans community. Since the 1990s,
<em>trans</em> has been defined in contrast to <em>cisgender</em> and
in an unsteady relationship with <em>nonbinary</em>. Coined in 1994 by
biologist Dana Defosse, elucidated by activist Julia Serano in her
2007 <em>Whipping Girl</em>, and finally added to <em>the Oxford
English Dictionary</em> in 2015, <em>cisgender</em> typically names
the natural or universal non-trans category: &ldquo;people who have
only ever experienced their subconscious and physical sexes to be
aligned&rdquo; or whose sex and gender &ldquo;match&rdquo; (Serano
2007: 12; Enke 2012: 61). Similarly, <em>cissexism</em> and
<em>cisnormativity</em> name the cultural ideology that normalizes cis
gender and produces transphobia (Simakawa 2018). Canonized in Susan
Stryker&rsquo;s <em>Transgender History</em> (2008b) and continuously
deployed today, the term <em>cis</em> has nevertheless been subject to
critique for several reasons. First, it recentralizes assigned binary
sex and the authority of medical-juridical determinations, thereby
erasing intersex people from the outset (Viloria &amp; Nieto 2020).
Second, <em>cisgender</em> reinscribes the normativity of cisness, and
therefore not only fails to account for the non-naturalness of
becoming a man or a woman at all (cp. Beauvoir 1949 [2011]; Burke
forthcoming) but also fails to critically interrogate the norms at
work in transness (Enke 2012). Third, the term not only presumes the
whiteness of the cisgender subject but may in fact require whiteness
(Detournay 2019; Leo 2020; Bey 2022b). Fourth and finally, given its
presumption of race, class, and ability norms, in addition to its
presumption of gender passiveness and inheriting gender fully formed,
it is unclear who, if anyone, can actually be cis (Enke 2012).</p>

<p>
<em>Nonbinary</em> has followed a similar temporal arc.
<em>Nonbinary</em> first took hold in the early 2000s as a term to
refer to genders that are neither man nor woman, trans or otherwise,
<em>and</em> have no intent to dismantle the trans category (S. Clare
2023). The term has increasingly been opposed, however, to trans or
proffered as what comes after trans (Rajunov &amp; Duane 2019;
Dembroff 2018&mdash;see Other Internet Resources). If
&ldquo;trans&rdquo; is understood (reductively) as crossing between
two binary poles, then &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; would be a
radicalization of trans, a leaping off the map as it were or at least
off the line (Washburn &amp; Fuqua 2023). Despite widespread uptake
and resonance among gender disruptive people, the term has certain
limitations to negotiate. First, nonbinary defines itself in relation
to the binary (or &ldquo;depends on a fragile juxtapositional
logic&rdquo; [Smilges 2023: 38]), a lexical fact that the related
terms agender, genderqueer, neogender, neurogender, xenogender, and
even enby avoid (Genderfluid Support 2019&mdash;see Other Internet
Resources). Second, while many people use both <em>trans</em> and
<em>nonbinary</em> as self-descriptions, the latter term, as
theorized, often pits the trans and nonbinary community against
itself, misreading trans people who do not use &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo;
as merely dupes of the binary gender system and erasing their gender
resistance and creativity. Robin Dembroff, for example, argues that
nonbinary &ldquo;destabilize[s] the binary axis&rdquo; while
&ldquo;trans binary&rdquo; does not (2020a 3, 15&ndash;16). This
position informs their argument that we are duty-bound not to use
gender-specific pronouns &ldquo;to refer to anyone&rdquo;, despite
gender-specific pronouns being a &ldquo;beneficial resource for
transgender persons&rdquo; (read &ldquo;trans binary&rdquo;) (2018:
382). Marquis Bey similarly argues that (&ldquo;binary&rdquo;) trans
people are &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; by their trans genders (2022b:
141). While the independent attribution of she/he pronouns is a
&ldquo;semiotic crime&rdquo;, any attachment to them is suspect
(2022b: 106, 58). Bey calls for the widespread practice of
nonbinariness and they/them pronouns as part and parcel of abolishing
(cis and trans) gender. Third, a comparatively apolitical term, in
contrast to its predecessor <em>genderqueer</em>, <em>nonbinary</em>
nevertheless functions, under neoliberal capitalism, to reify a
three-tiered gender system of pronouns/genders on bureaucratic forms
and legal paperwork, a fact that limits its ability to disrupt
institutional processes of gender ascription and legitimation and
further alienates trans and gender disruptive people who do not
self-categorize as man, woman, or nonbinary (Amin 2022).</p>

<h3 id="DecoTran">1.3 Decolonizing Transgender</h3>

<p>
With respect to who <em>trans</em> refers to, from its earliest
inception it has aspired to name a broad swath of people past and
present, here and elsewhere, who challenge Western gender norms of
&ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo;. This tack, which is taken
by Leslie Feinberg&rsquo;s <em>Transgender Warriors</em> (1996) and
other works of its ilk, often explicitly extends transgender status
to, for example, Indian hijras, Indigenous Two-Spirits, Filipino
baklas, Samoan fa&rsquo;afafines, Thai kathoeys, etc. Bakla Filipina
b. binaohan<!--keep lowercase--> (2014), however, among many others,
has argued that such an extension is colonial in nature, taking a
Western concept and applying it to non-Western embodiments in a way
that erases their own, highly contextual gender creativity. A similar
critique has been made by Indigenous peoples. People who use the term
Two Spirit or Indigenous terms for gender nonconformity are not the
same as, or reducible to, or capturable by <em>trans</em> (Driskill et
al. 2011) and attempts to make it so are a product of colonial
theorizing (Morgensen 2011). Gender disruptive or creative Indigenous
peoples may have a non-trans sense not only of embodiment, but also of
temporality, history, and belonging (Pyle 2018). From an Asian
diasporic perspective, Chen and Kimoto have emphasized that Western,
especially US-centric trans norms impinge upon and are insufficient
for Asian trans masculinities and femininities (Chen 2010; Kimoto
2024). Chen has also explored the gender-disruptive promise of
Pinyin&rsquo;s pronoun <em>ta</em> in contrast to the English
<em>they</em>. Indeed, whole gender histories are being overwritten by
the global expansion of &ldquo;trans&rdquo;, a loss itself difficult
to fathom. It is in this context that many have called for
decolonizing and deglobalizing the term <em>trans</em> itself.</p>

<p>
With respect to what <em>trans</em> refers to, or what transness
itself means, a similar divide has formed. On the one hand, Black
trans studies has argued that, insofar as blackness compromises the
manhood and womanhood of Black people, blackness and transness are
inseparable. This lineage begins with Hortense Spillers (2003), who
theorized the &ldquo;ungendering&rdquo; of Black flesh under slavery,
and continues through C. Riley Snorton (2017), Kai M. Green (2016),
and Marquis Bey (2022a,b), each of whom in their own way has argued
that ungendered flesh is, in some way, trans flesh (with the
&ldquo;trans&rdquo; reference here partially loosed from transgender
people). Conversely, gender and gendering is understood to be a
product of settler colonialism and slavery. For Bey, all of those who
fail gender and white coloniality can then access both transness and
blackness (2022b: 72&ndash;73). This claim runs parallel to the
inverse one that decolonization requires reconceptualizing gender
itself as &ldquo;always already trans&rdquo; (Tudor 2021).
&ldquo;Trans&rdquo; has elsewhere taken a different journey, however.
Latinx studies, for example, which roots itself, first, not in the
abyssal ontologies of US slavery but in gendered embodiments specific
to Latin America, has generated significant critiques of the terms
<em>trans</em> and <em>transgender</em>. While Latinx and Chicanx
scholars (e.g., Ochoa 2014; Cuevas 2018; Galarte 2021) find in
borderlands and border dwellers rich figurations that complement as
much as re-comport &ldquo;trans&rdquo;, theorists such as Hija de
Perra (2014) and PJ DiPietro (forthcoming), resonating with travesti
theorists Lohana Berkins (2019) and Marlene Wayar (2019, 2024), argue
that there is a virulent coloniality to <em>trans</em> and to
<em>transgender</em>: the terms are undergirded by Western
metaphysical assumptions (e.g., identity, sexual dimorphism,
categorial logic, anthropocentrism, etc.), and they consume everything
before and behind them, suppressing ontologies and embodiments
specific to the Americas. For them, &ldquo;trans&rdquo; is not
inherently a liberatory frame to be embraced but yet another dominant
logic to be critically interrogated.</p>

<h3 id="TranDivi">1.4 The Trans/Disability Divide</h3>

<p>
Trans accountable scholarship by and large shares one fundamental
commitment: that transness is not a psychiatric illness. As such,
trans experiences should not be pathologized and gender dysphoria
(previously gender identity disorder) should be removed from the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Transness is a
natural, healthy expression of human diversity. Indeed, in one of
trans studies&rsquo; founding moments, Stryker (2006: 1) announces to
an academic assembly, &ldquo;I am not sick&rdquo;. Arguably, trans
philosophy has a similar founding moment. In &ldquo;Evil Deceivers,
Make Believers&rdquo; (2007), Talia Bettcher elucidates the double
bind trans people find themselves in, being taken either as gender
frauds or gender fakes, living in a delusional world of their own
fantasies. Contradicting the double bind, Bettcher argues that trans
people have moral integrity and are real. They are mentally healthy,
reasonable, and decent people. The no doubt unintended presumption
here, however, is that neither trans people nor their transness would
be real if they suffered from psychosis, PTSD, dissociation, or other
breaks from reality. As such, there is a founding divide between trans
and disability experiences and communities undergirding trans studies
and trans philosophy, a divide that those same experiences and
communities repeatedly trouble.</p>

<p>
Trans and disability communities overlap in lived experience, with
trans people being almost twice as likely to have a disability as
their non-trans peers (Smith-Johnson 2022; Cavar &amp; Baril 2022).
Trans and disability communities also share deep histories of
discrimination, criminalization, and objectification for being misfits
and for having the wrong or non-normative bodies, disordered from the
start (Wilkerson 2012). The everyday gawking to which they are
subject, moreover, often becomes, in medical settings, an insistent
need to cure and to fix, such that one might pass as not trans and/or
not disabled (E. Clare 1999, 2003, 2017). Despite these experiential
and historical intimacies and entanglements, there are structural
forces that consistently drive a wedge between what would otherwise be
grounds for solidarity. The systemic discrimination that consistently
de-capacitates transgender people and de-genders disabled people leave
these communities eager to defend their alignment with normal
abilities and normative genders, respectively. When, against these
forces, trans and disability communities resist the braid of
compulsory ablebodymindedness and cisheterosexuality together, they do
so in numerous ways, including reclaiming slurs (E. Clare 1999),
advocating for access (physical, legal, social, linguistic) (Chess et
al. 2008; Kafer 2013), negotiating passing and intra-community
(in)visibilities, and generating crip- and trans- resistance tactics
(Baril 2016; Thornton 2019). They come together in their pride at
troubling the line.</p>

<p>
The confluence of trans and disability communities prompts important
questions about what (trans/)gender is when that (trans/)gender is
disabled or crip. It invites us to think the <em>gender</em>
<em>nonconformity</em> of madness and disability, as much as the
<em>madness</em> and <em>disability</em> of gender non-conformity. And
to think this as a critique of trans studies&rsquo;&mdash;and perhaps
also trans philosophy&rsquo;s&mdash;longstanding investments in
ableism, specifically its insistence that &ldquo;trans&rdquo; is
natural and healthy, not a mental illness, psychiatric condition, or
psychosomatic dysfunction (Awkward-Rich 2022). Cavar (2022) has coined
the term <em>transMadness</em> to refer to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a wandering and wondering praxis, anticipating and refusing
neurotypical, sane, cis supervision in both the structure of our
thought(s) and in the comportment of our bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consider examples of terminology and temporality at this intersection.
People situated in trans/mad communities are naming new genders: e.g.,
autigender, gendervague, neurogender, neuroqueer, and neurotrans
(Smilges 2022). Terms like these insist that the landscape of gender
and world be transed/cripped together. Moreover, against neoliberal
capitalist demands for productive bodies (Puar 2017), demands which
hide the circuities and elliptical excursions&mdash;or structural
unproductivities&mdash;inherent to cisheteronormativity and ableism,
trans/crip communities engage in &ldquo;wastetime&rdquo;, lagging,
limping, and late time (Baril 2016, 2023; Thornton 2019; Adair
2022).</p>

<p>
The challenge for trans philosophy going forward is to honor these
many intimacies between trans and disability experiences, communities,
and theories. In its quest for linear sense-making, in particular,
trans philosophy ought also to value circuitous
sense-unmaking&mdash;the unsteady and the mad. So attuned, trans
philosophy will be better able to illuminate the nature of dis/order,
the power of dis/epistemologies (Ben-Moshe 2018), and the concrete
demands of trans/crip justice.</p>

<h2 id="WhatTranPhil">2. What is Trans Philosophy?</h2>

<h3 id="Meta">2.1 Metaphilosophy</h3>

<p>
As stated above, trans philosophy is philosophical work that is
accountable to and illuminative of transgender experiences, histories,
cultural productions, and politics (Zurn et al. 2024; Trans Philosophy
Project
 [<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>]).
 As such, it is rooted in the life and thought of trans and gender
disruptive people. It necessarily attends to the ways in which trans
and gender disruptive people have made meaning and community in a
largely transphobic world and susses out the philosophical quandaries
therein. While trans philosophical work has occurred since the 1990s,
across analytic, continental, and pluralist traditions and in dialogue
with trans studies, trans philosophy as an academic
enterprise&nbsp;has coalesced in more recent years through the
organizational work of transgender, travesti, Two Spirit, and gender
disruptive people themselves, as well as their allies and friends.
&ldquo;Rich, living trans worlds are bursting into&rdquo; the field of
philosophy, Amy Marvin (2019a) writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
resulting in an account of trans experience, concepts, metaphors, and
understanding that is more informed about the complex endeavor of
being trans in the world and its resulting politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In defining trans philosophy, Bettcher (2019b) insists it is not
philosophizing <em>about</em> trans issues; it is philosophizing
<em>from</em> and <em>with</em> trans lives. It does not place the
margins under a microscope, but rather stands in the perplexities of
the perimeter and gets to work. Trans philosophy is, fundamentally, a
critical project and a grounded, collective endeavor.</p>

<p>
Trans philosophy stands in stark contrast to several ways in which
philosophy&mdash;largely in North America and Europe&mdash;takes up
trans issues. First, and far too often, philosophy often studies trans
life &ldquo;objectively&rdquo;, so to speak, as a mere intellectual
problem, to be turned this way and that and reshelved when finished
(Bettcher 2018&mdash;see Other Internet Resources). This style of
philosophical work takes up trans life as a case study, or a thought
experiment, on the way to some other philosophical point, whether
about metaphysics, personal identity, or consciousness. Second,
philosophy repeatedly considers trans issues in the absence of trans
voices, literatures, and
 histories.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Such work assumes that little, if any, true philosophical worth
exists in trans people&rsquo;s own sense-making practices (Hale
1997&mdash;see Other Internet Resources). Finally, philosophy has been
used by trans-exclusionary feminists and their allies to develop and
justify trans-exclusionary gender theory and public policy. This
strand of philosophy does not aim to understand trans experience, but
rather to defend the intellectual and political sanctity of an
exclusive and hierarchical gender binary. Trans philosophy, as a
distinctive practice, is committed to grappling with philosophical
issues that arise in trans and gender disruptive life, as identified,
characterized, and interpreted by those people themselves, in an
effort to make greater conceptual and material room in the world, both
within and beyond various dyadic gender structures.</p>

<p>
Trans philosophy follows a long line of philosophies of
difference&mdash;that is, philosophies that root their theoretical
contributions in a people and a place, illuminating specific axes of
difference and specific positionalities within larger systems of
social (and epistemic) inequality. These philosophies of difference
include (at least) Africana philosophy; Asian and Asian-American
philosophy; Eastern philosophy; feminist philosophy; Indigenous
philosophy; Afro-Latinx, Latinx, and Latin American philosophy; LGBT
philosophy; philosophy of disability; and postcolonial and decolonial
philosophy. Without presuming simplistic similitude, trans philosophy
relies on conceptualizations of embodiment, history, identity,
language, oppression, and resistance in those sibling projects. It
also owes a clear debt to women of color feminist theorizations of
standpoint epistemology, intersectionality, coalition-building,
community accountability, and critiques of imperialism (cp. Allen
1986; Anzald&uacute;a 1987; Collins 1990; Crenshaw 1991; Lugones 2003;
Spivak 1999). Building on these foundational insights, trans
philosophy at its best attends to trans voices while resisting the
universalization of white, wealthy, able-bodied trans experience. It
furthermore recognizes that its work is always already being done
outside of philosophy departments and academic publication venues, and
well outside of the Global North. In attending expressly to
disability, race and ethnicity, poverty, community theorizing, and the
Global South, trans philosophy has a chance of doing greater justice
to the complexity and variability of gender disruptive and creative
life.</p>

<p>
Trans philosophy is a critical project insofar as it reprises certain
elements of the critical tradition: (1) it analyzes the conditions of
possibility for trans and gender disruptive experience, (2) it
questions the social institutions and structures that most impinge on
those lives, and (3) it is reflexive, allowing itself to be implicated
and changed in the process. In a tradition typically rooted in
Immanuel Kant, the Frankfurt School, and poststructuralism (Kant 1781;
Horkheimer 1937; Foucault 1978/1990; Butler 2004), but which extends
well beyond them to include especially feminist, African American, and
Latin American traditions of critical praxis and struggle (Butler
1990, 2004a, 2004b; Gordon 2023; Mignolo 2011), critique attempts not
only to understand how the state of things arose, but also to
radically question it and risk one&rsquo;s own subject formation in
doing so. As a critical project, then, trans philosophy aspires to
understand the conditions that make trans flourishing possible (or
impossible), but it also works to ameliorate those conditions and
support trans and gender disruptive people in their joys and struggles
the world over. This work is necessarily grounded and placed, but it
is also reflexive. It entails reckoning with the history of
<em>trans</em> as a category that both illuminates and hides the
realities it means to foreground. As such, trans philosophy undertakes
experiential and institutional critiques among specific trans
communities and social structures, but it also sets out to transform
itself, submitting its own borders and boundaries&mdash;those it has
inherited as much as those it has constructed&mdash;to critique as
well.</p>

<h3 id="HistTranPhil">2.2 History of Trans Philosophy</h3>

<p>
It is no simple task to locate the origin of trans life, let alone
trans philosophy. The word <em>transgender</em> gained prominence in
the early 1990s, referring to a broad swath of people who wander from
the sex/gender they were assigned at birth (Stryker 2008b [2017]). Of
course, this is only the most recent chapter of a long history of
gender deviance and gender creativity (Feinberg 1996; Manion 2020). In
this light, one history of trans philosophy might extend back to
Butler&rsquo;s <em>Gender Trouble</em> (1990) and Halberstam&rsquo;s
<em>Female Masculinity</em> (1998a) or to the gender transgressiveness
of feminist philosophy itself or even to gender disruptive
philosophers for several millennia. But the story is more complicated
still. Contemporary trans philosophy and trans theorizing in multiple
countries have differing genealogies, and a number of cultures have
long traditions that defy and exceed gender binaries and norms.
Thinking trans (and, indeed, non-trans gender disruptive life), as a
deeply philosophical practice, is far from a unitary project, but
spans multiple geographies, cultures, and histories, some newly
emergent and some violently submerged. These differing and diasporic
histories not only actively inform and critique what trans philosophy
is and can (and cannot) be, but they demand a crucial practice of
geopolitical accountability.</p>

<p>
One way to tell the story of trans philosophy in the US is to begin in
2006 with the publication of the first <em>Transgender Studies
Reader</em> (Stryker &amp; Whittle 2006). Shortly thereafter, in 2009,
Bettcher and Ann Garry edited a special issue of <em>Hypatia</em> on
trans studies and feminist philosophy, while Laurie Shrage edited
<em>You&rsquo;ve Changed: Sex Reassignment and Personal
 Identity</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Including luminaries such as C. Jacob Hale, Cressida Heyes, Viviane
Namaste, Gayle Salamon, and C. Riley Snorton, these two projects aimed
to explore the &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;interplay&rdquo;
between trans studies and feminist philosophy. Following the
publication of the <em>Transgender Studies Reader 2</em> in 2013,
trans philosophy coalesced as a spoken and written term in 2016 with
the Trans* Experience in Philosophy Conference at University of Oregon
and its aftermath (Zurn 2016&mdash;see Other Internet
 Resources).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 The Trans Philosophy Project was then established in 2018, funded by
the American Philosophical Association and <em>Hypatia</em>. The field
now has its first defining collection, <em>Trans Philosophy</em> (Zurn
et al. 2024). It would be a mistake, however, to think that trans
philosophy arose within the US only in the university and as an
extension of already existing debates in feminist philosophy. As early
trans philosophers testify, their work was rooted in trans
community-building, trans activism, and interdisciplinary inquiry,
such that trans philosophy was always already public philosophy and
community theorizing (Zurn &amp; Pitts 2020; Bettcher 2022; Zurn
2023). Moreover, it would also be a mistake to credit exclusively
well-positioned trans and feminist philosophers for the advent of
academic trans philosophy, when much&nbsp;of the theoretical and
service work that made it possible was undertaken by graduate
students, contingent scholars, and junior faculty (Adair,
Awkward-Rich, &amp; Marvin 2020).</p>

<p>
Similar stories might be told of the rise of trans philosophy in
Canada and the UK. Moreover, the philosophical roots of trans and
travesti critique in Argentina developed in a parallel but distinct
vein. As defined by Marlene Wayar (2019, 2024), the term
<em>travesti</em> refers to a group of Latin American people who
&ldquo;de-identify&rdquo; with manhood and womanhood, &ldquo;break
free&rdquo; from the logic of sex/gender correspondence, and
&ldquo;construct&rdquo; themselves otherwise. Philosophical work
emerged from the grassroot struggles of trans, travesti, and
transsexual activists such as Wayar, Nadia Echaz&uacute;, Lohana
Berkins, and Diana Sacay&aacute;n, including their efforts to
transform the legislative, representational, and institutional
conditions for gender variant peoples across the country (De Mauro
Rucovsky 2019; DiPietro forthcoming). It continues with the work of
the Independent Chair in Trans* Studies at the University of Buenos
Aires. Common to this work is a critique of the term <em>trans</em>,
as well as trans theoretical discourse, as predominantly US-based and
Global-North-centric. This critique is paired with a concomitant
insistence that local lineages and embodiments of gender disruption
and creativity be thought with at least as much care as
&ldquo;trans&rdquo; lineages and embodiments (Radi 2019). Reflective
of this turn, Lohana Berkins (2019), for example, asserts that
something &ldquo;gets lost&rdquo; with the overemphasis or singular
emphasis on &ldquo;trans identity&rdquo;. One of those things is
non-identity-centric organizing, i.e., the transversality
(<em>transversalidad</em>) or the transversal coalitions that, in
fact, mobilize trans and travesti people in political resistance
alongside a host of other marginalized groups (cf. DiPietro 2016).</p>

<p>
At their roots, trans philosophy and travesti theory develop from the
material precarity and local community of trans and non-trans gender
disruptive people. As such, they require validating the epistemic
authority and supporting the community struggles of those people. They
also require grappling with the location of trans philosophical
theorizing outside or at the edge of the white, Anglo- and Eurocentric
norms of philosophy itself.</p>

<h2 id="ExpeCrit">3. Experiential Critique</h2>

<p>
Trans philosophy begins with the recognition that there are trans
issues to be illuminated through philosophical methods whose
application is deeply informed by trans people themselves. This
foundation stands in sharp distinction from the ways in which trans
life is typically treated in academic and non-academic settings. As
Marvin (2020) diagnoses it, trans people are typically subject to
&ldquo;curiotization&rdquo;, which she defines as &ldquo;the process
of transfiguration into a curio&rdquo; (194), or the ways in which
trans people are objectified in the service of entertainment or
scholarly interest. Perry Zurn (2021b) calls this the
&ldquo;spectacle-erasure formation&rdquo; of curiosity, whereby an
object is spectacularized while its subjective complexity is erased.
To resist this force of curiotization, Zurn proposes that trans
people&rsquo;s own practices of curiosity&mdash;their own habits of
way finding and meaning making&mdash;be not only recognized, but also
honored as foundational components of any trans theory (2021a: 193).
This has important implications for trans philosophizing. While some
philosophers (even trans philosophers) make various arguments about
trans people by appealing merely to some higher reason or reality
(Dembroff 2020b; Burke 2022), trans philosophy proper requires more.
It requires asking: How must trans knowledge, experience, history, and
ontology be thought when trans and gender disruptive people themselves
are acknowledged as theorists in their own right? That is, it requires
a robust praxis of trans epistemology, trans phenomenology, trans
genealogy, and trans metaphysics, a praxis often nourished by
trans/feminism.</p>

<h3 id="Tran">3.1 Trans/Feminism</h3>

<p>
Trans philosophy is not synonymous with philosophy of gender today,
insofar as the former takes as thought&rsquo;s generative ground what
the latter currently takes as object of thought: (trans)gender
experience. Trans philosophy is also not synonymous with feminist
philosophy. However, insofar as trans philosophy is committed to
conceptual illumination in the service of gender justice (and in
resistance to gender oppression), trans philosophy is (at least)
feminist in nature. And this should be no real surprise.
Demographically, of course, some trans people are women, while some
trans people break from womanhood, and all trans people are
structurally subordinated by virtue of their genders. An attention to
gender equity, thus, is germane to the territory. Conceptually,
moreover, key terms and debates in feminist philosophy (e.g.,
embodiment, normative scripts, standpoint epistemology,
intersectionality, sex vs. gender, nature vs. culture, etc.) have been
crucial to the development of trans philosophy. It is only on the
heels (or perhaps the shoulders) of feminist philosophers that trans
philosophers can ask, for example, if and how &ldquo;trans&rdquo; is a
gender, a personal identity, a political position, or a coalitional
stance. It is, furthermore, in concert with feminism&rsquo;s critique
of patriarchy that trans philosophy can critique
cisheteronormativity&mdash;a critique grounded, in both cases, in
experience. All of that said, however, the relationship between
feminism and trans theory, and more specifically between feminist and
trans philosophy, has been a rocky one. Moving between coalitions and
crises, their journey together is still unfinished. It is only
possible here to recount some of the highlights of that history,
highlights that set the stage for the projects of trans epistemology,
phenomenology, genealogy, and metaphysics (for more, see Bettcher
2009a[2014]).</p>

<p>
Trans exclusionary feminism and radical lesbianism, especially their
recent reappearance in the form of &ldquo;gender critical
feminism&rdquo;, is hardly the most noteworthy, or intellectually
interesting, part of this history. While Sandy Stone&rsquo;s landmark
essay &ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back&rdquo; (1987), in which she
proposes gender as genre and trans as a hybrid or in-between kind, was
indeed written in response to radical feminist Raymond (1979), it was
also written in the footsteps of Stone&rsquo;s dissertation advisor:
feminist science studies scholar Donna Haraway (1985). Of course, the
idea that gender is not born but made can be traced back to Simone de
Beauvoir (1949 [2011]) and forward to Judith Butler, whose theory of
gender performativity was important for early trans theory (1990,
2004b). As time progressed, Butler was critiqued for overlooking
actual trans life on the ground and the socio-cultural forces it
resists (Prosser 1998; Namaste 2000). Subsequently, feminist attention
has been given to (trans)gender&rsquo;s embeddedness in the body
(Salamon 2010; Heyes 2007; Scheman 2011), as well as its inflection in
coloniality and slavery (see
 <a href="#DecoTran">&sect;1.3</a>
 above and
 <a href="#InstCrit">&sect;4.1</a>
 below). It has become incumbent to think not simply of feminist
approaches to trans issues but of <em>transfeminism</em>, which is
defined, by turns, as (1) trans perspectives on feminist issues, (2)
trans women&rsquo;s theorization for liberation, or (3) an
intersectional movement addressing oppression faced by all gender
minorities, especially trans and of color (Koyama 2003, 2006; Serano
2007; Enke 2012). Key terms in transfeminism, as understood in the
latter sense, include intersectionality (Collins 2019), mestiza
consciousness (Anzald&uacute;a 1987), multiplicitous selves and worlds
(Lugones 2003), transmisogyny (Serano 2007; Gill-Peterson 2024),
transmasculinity and trans maladjustment (Awkward-Rich 2022), trans
oppression/resistance (Bettcher 2014b), and ungendered flesh (Spillers
2003).</p>

<h3 id="TranEpis">3.2 Trans Epistemology</h3>

<p>
Trans epistemology aims to understand the epistemic effects of
transphobia and identify the epistemic resources of trans life. The
first and most vibrant camp of trans epistemology, then, diagnoses the
epistemic injustices sustained by trans communities, while the second
develops the trans community&rsquo;s own epistemic contributions to
what and how we know. The epistemic injustices diagnosed are both
unsurprising and yet unique. Like so many other marginalized
communities, trans communities sustain a variety of testimonial and
hermeneutic injustices, including de-legitimating stereotypes and
knowledge subjugation (Fricker 2007; Stryker 2006; McKinnon 2014;
Aultman 2016). The tactics of such injustices, however, are
importantly specific to transgender experience itself. Trans people
are repeatedly dismissed as evil deceivers or make believers with
respect to their gender, as those who do not know ourselves let alone
other things (Bettcher 2007, 2009b). Consigning trans people to the
realm of &ldquo;unknowers&rdquo;, Blas Radi clarifies, involves
&ldquo;de-qualifying trans epistemic subjectivity&rdquo; and
&ldquo;canceling [trans] epistemic authority&rdquo; (2019: 52). Once
categorized as unknowers, trans people can then simply be the object
of dominant knowers and knowledge making practices, which historically
involve exposure, dissection, objectification, fetishization, colonial
appropriation, and instrumentalization (Namaste 2009; Raun 2014; Zurn
2021a; Radi 2019; Marvin 2020). Any antidote to such dominating
epistemic practices, trans scholars and allies argue, must involve
collaborating with trans people, honoring trans wisdom, using trans
terms, and practicing a &ldquo;respectful curiosity&rdquo; (Hale
1997&mdash;see Other Internet Resources; Namaste 2009; Raun 2014).</p>

<p>
But there is more to the trans epistemic story than unseating dominant
knowledge structures and decentering gender normative people as
knowers. A complementary component is trans people flourishing as
knowers themselves, or, as Radi puts it, claiming a space at the
banquet instead of being items on the menu (2019: 45). This requires a
positive trans epistemology. This effort may include de-subjugating
trans knowledges by building trans histories, theories, and
vocabularies (Stryker 2006). It may include insisting on the
importance of &ldquo;the trans ordinary&rdquo; and trans poetics as
spaces in which meaning is made, rather than simply through
oppression, violence, suffering, or sadness (Aultman 2019; Zurn
forthcoming-a). It may include appreciating the precise ways in which
trans people undo gender constructs, thereby making more epistemic
room, especially through the disruption of gender attribution and the
production of gender anomie (Nordmarken 2019). It may include
resisting tropes like &ldquo;the wrong body&rdquo;, as well as
generating new terminological frames, such as cisgender, and its
derivatives cissexism, cisgenderism, cisnormativity, cistemic,
ciscentric, etc. (Radi 2019; Serano 2007). Or it may include insisting
on the specificity of trans knowledge-making practices (for which
virtual environments and [in]visibility have been historically
important factors), as well as their immense variability (due to their
intersecting identities and social positions) (Nicolazzo 2021). The
epistemic injustices perpetrated by trans knowers and trans studies
themselves, however, remain to be deeply excavated and acknowledged.
These include transmisogyny, trans ableism, trans masc occlusions,
multiple racial hierarchies, a centering of the Global North, as well
as elitism and prestige bias (Radi 2019: 44&ndash;46; Marvin
2024).</p>

<h3 id="TranPhen">3.3 Trans Phenomenology</h3>

<p>
Trans epistemology&rsquo;s commitment to centering trans knowledges
invites practitioners to further analyze the present structures of
trans experience and the structuring forces in trans life&mdash;or, to
trans phenomenology and to trans <em>critical</em> phenomenology. As
developed by Edmund Husserl (1913), Martin Heidegger (1927), Jean-Paul
Sartre (1943), and Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945), classical
phenomenology aims to understand both what appears and how it appears.
To do so, it brackets the &ldquo;natural attitude&rdquo; (i.e., common
perceptions and common sense) and privileges, instead, first-person
perception of the sensory world. Feminist and queer phenomenologies
excavate the ways in which differently shaped and oriented bodies
change the shape of experience (Ahmed 2006; Burke 2018). Trans
phenomenology turns that attention to trans bodies, noting how the
world is experienced by trans people in and through trans embodiment
and dysphoria (Rubin 1998; Prosser 1998; Baldino 2015). A number of
analytic distinctions arise from there. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty,
Gayle Salamon (2010) argues that there is a disjunction&mdash;for all
genders&mdash;between the corporeal body and the &ldquo;felt&rdquo;
body (or the &ldquo;body schema&rdquo;). Turning to Heidegger, Das
Janssen (2017) connects the individual and relational aspects of
transgender experience with being-there (<em>Dasein</em>) and
being-with (<em>Mitsein</em>). Furthermore, some strands of trans
phenomenology also rely heavily on psychoanalysis (Prosser 1998;
Salamon 2010; Stephano 2019; Stewart 2017).</p>

<p>
Critical phenomenology, as the joining of critical theory and
phenomenology, aims to understand how first-person experiences are
shaped by contingent structures in the world (Guenther 2013; Burke
2020a). One might, for example, develop a critical phenomenology of
transphobia, marking the ways in which transphobia, homophobia,
racism, and ableism determine how bodies are made to appear&mdash;and
to disappear&mdash;in courtrooms, schools, on the streets and in
families (Salamon 2018). One might further explore the ways in which
bodies, body parts, bodily gestures, and bodily habits are multiply
coded in transphobic worlds and multiply recoded by trans-gressive
individuals and communities, perhaps uniquely in trans of color
communities (Kimoto 2018). While transphobia is an important locus of
phenomenological attention, such attention can become more critical by
marking the trans resistance practices&mdash;or, as Bettcher terms it,
trans &ldquo;discontent&rdquo;&mdash;in and through which trans people
experience and negotiate their world (2019a). Where there is a world,
however, there are always already multiple worlds (Lugones 2003).
Important extensions of trans critical phenomenological work address
agender (or non-gendered) experience (Burke 2020b), trans of color
experience (Kimoto 2018), phenomena at the intersection of trans-ness
and disability (Awkward-Rich 2022), and experiences of home and
homelessness among trans people (Gustafsson 2024). Ultimately, the
project of trans phenomenology provides reflective strategies and
attunements that unravel the many ways in which gender is constrained
by the internal structures and institutional structuring of trans
experience.</p>

<h3 id="TranHistTranStor">3.4 Trans History, Trans Story</h3>

<p>
Knowledge and experience&mdash;both trans and otherwise&mdash;are
rooted in multiple histories and competing genealogies. Inherent in
the critical task of analyzing how and what we know is the project of
unpacking how we tell our stories. An important strand of trans
theory&mdash;as expressed in life or argued in
scholarship&mdash;resists the &ldquo;trans narrative&rdquo; that trans
men were boys from the start, or trans women were girls from the
start, or trans nonbinary people were misfitting from the start, and
that they have always had an uncomplicated attachment to their current
gender and pursued it with stereotypical social and medical transition
techniques (e.g., changing name, pronouns, clothes, gender roles;
taking hormones and undergoing surgery) (Spade 2013). In contrast to
this narrative, trans people proliferate trans stories, weaving
personal and collective histories of transing gender that honor the
way gender disruptions and creations eddy across gender disruptors and
creators themselves, leaving a complex and often unsteady subject in
their wake.</p>

<p>
Beyond the work of troubling stories of trans individuals lies the
work of troubling trans histories. Against a presumption that trans
experience arose with the adoption of the term <em>transgender</em> in
the early 1990s US context, trans theorists and historians have begun
to track the multiple histories of gender disruption and creativity in
earlier eras, as well as in non-US and non-dominant US contexts. And
while there is significant disagreement over how far the term
<em>trans</em> can stretch historiographically (Manion 2020; LaFleur,
Raskolnikov, &amp; K&#322;osowska 2021), such efforts in trans
genealogy provide significant opportunities to revisit basic questions
in the philosophy of history, including the nature of (trans and
non-trans) archives (Rawson 2009, 2015; Correa et al. 2019), the
historiographical construction of (trans) origin stories, and the
possibilities for thinking the (trans) present differently. Whether
identifying the ways in which twenty-first century trans life is
striated by economic precarity (Adair, Awkward-Rich, &amp; Marvin
2020), biopolitical technologies (Preciado 2008 [2013], 2011 [2018]),
or white neoliberalism (Gill-Peterson 2018); or exploring the
imbrication of blackness and transness in the twentieth and nineteenth
century (Snorton 2017); or recovering Indigenous conceptualizations of
Two Spirit and gender variant people (Pyle 2018); or locating genders
between and beyond man/woman at the heart of medieval life (DeVun
2021), the field of trans history and the philosophical questions it
raises invite significant future work in trans philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="TranMeta">3.5 Trans Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
In a world that consistently denies &ldquo;realness&rdquo; to trans
people and their genders, trans metaphysics explores questions of
social ontology and personal identity with the goal of situating
transness in reality and as being real (Mock 2014). Over and over
again, trans people are told, either explicitly or through the very
structure of things, that their genders are fake (and dangerous) and
that their true selves are not their trans selves but their original,
sex-assigned-at-birth selves. Ontological questions are hurled at
trans people as a way to police them: What are you? But what are you
really? What body did God give you? What is your real gender? People
working in trans metaphysics have the difficult task of rewiring basic
assumptions about ontology and identity such that gender transition
(and gender wandering) has substantial weight. What is the substance
of gender such that transgender is substantial (or ontologically
real)? How are trans people the same across transition and how are
they different? How much of transness is determined by biological or
social underpinnings, and how much of it is freely chosen? How real
can a chosen gender be? Is the human defined by naturally occurring
flesh or is there a fundamental (or originary) &ldquo;madeness&rdquo;
to the human body, such that monstrosity, hybridity, and yes transness
are germane rather than peripheral to it? These philosophical
questions have been taken up from the early stages of trans philosophy
and in dialogue with medicine, psychology, cognitive science, and
science studies (Shrage 2009).</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, perhaps, most of the recent energy in the area of
trans metaphysics has focused on the question &ldquo;what is
gender&rdquo; (Briggs &amp; Dvorak 2023). As early as 1996, C. Jacob
Hale exploded the category of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; into thirteen
different characteristics, the set of which and each instance of which
are neither necessary nor sufficient for womanhood. Importantly, Hale
penned the piece from &ldquo;an explicitly transsexual queer sex
radical subject position&rdquo; (<em>Hypatia</em> 1996: 189). Four
years later, Sally Haslanger (2000) offered her definition of gender
as genus, which categorizes men and women according to presumed
reproductive function and within hierarchical social relation. Such
genders, moreover, may be ascribed or conferred (Witt 2011;
&Aacute;sta 2013). Early accounts of gender kinds, however, were not
developed with trans people in mind or drawn from the work of trans
theorists. Critics have insisted that externalist accounts (gender as
externally perceived and constituted) need to take internalist
accounts (gender as internally experienced and identified) more
seriously (Jenkins 2016, 2018; Andler 2017). More recently, moreover,
<em>critical</em> gender kinds have been proposed, i.e., genders such
as genderqueer and nonbinary, which are not only socially constructed
and internally assessed but also, and more importantly, positioned
critically against inherited norms (Dembroff 2020a). More recently,
Katharine Jenkins has argued that there are hegemonic gender kinds
(informed by largescale patterns of privilege and subordination),
interpersonal gender kinds (produced and sustained in smallscale
social interactions), and identity gender kinds (which reflect the
ways people experientially categorize themselves)&nbsp;(Jenkins 2023).
Still, debate continues. External ascriptions of gender are arguably
not truth claims but ways of organizing social space (Kukla &amp;
Lance 2023). Internal assessment of gender identity is arguably a
cisnormative concept; trans people simply have (rather than
&ldquo;identify with&rdquo;) the genders they define and describe
(Saketopoulou &amp; Pellegrini 2023; Cull 2024; Hernandez &amp; Bell
forthcoming). That having of a gender, moreover, may have less to do
with positioning oneself in a taxonomy than feeling one&rsquo;s way
into a phenomenology (Briggs &amp; Dvorak 2023). Further work in trans
metaphysics,&nbsp;with a clear&nbsp;connection to trans and gender
expansive&nbsp;communities, may be able to resolve some of these
tensions.</p>

<h2 id="InstCrit">4. Institutional Critique</h2>

<p>
While experiential critique is necessary for the illumination of trans
experiences, histories, politics, and cultural production, it is not
sufficient; institutional critique affords a crucial supplement.
Structures of experience are, after all, formed and informed by
institutions&mdash;which is to say that social organizations structure
the contours and conditions of life as lived. Those social
organizations, moreover, have grown and replicated within the soil of
cisheteronormativity; as such, one of trans philosophy&rsquo;s tasks
is to critically interrogate their loud discursive pronouncements as
much as their silent material effects. To date, the bulk of this work
has focused on the institutional sites of colonialism, medical
industrialization, capitalism, law, and policy, as well as the
institutionalization of transphobia. Critique requires not simply
cognizing the conditions that make the present structures and effects
of institutions possible, however; it also requires the exploration of
adjacent possibilities. In what directions ought, then, institutional
critique in trans philosophy to move? A critical trans politics, as
defined by Dean Spade, requires more than securing trans and gender
disruptive/creative people recognition and ameliorating institutions
on their behalf. Balking at aspirations to inclusion, critical trans
politics instead insists on the transformation of the very logics upon
which &ldquo;state, civil society, security, and social
equality&rdquo; are founded (2011 [2015: 1]). It aims not to secure
reforms that ultimately continue to consign our community (and
especially our most vulnerable) to violence and suffering, but rather
to advance deep and lasting change through liberatory practices
(2011[2015: 2]). Insofar as trans philosophy works within the
tradition of critical trans politics, then, its critiques of
institutional life will extend to the recommendation of practices of
resistance and imagination.</p>

<h3 id="ColoGend">4.1 Coloniality of Gender</h3>

<p>
Insofar as trans philosophy has developed in colonized worlds, where
extractive institutions have long held sway, one of the subjects of
its critique is&nbsp;colonialism itself. Increasingly, certain strands
of trans studies and, in turn, trans philosophy, have taken
Mar&iacute;a Lugones&rsquo; diagnosis of &ldquo;the coloniality of
gender&rdquo; as a foundational tenet of sorts. Across multiple essays
(2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2020), Lugones developed her account of the
&ldquo;modern/colonial gender system&rdquo;, according to which
<em>gender</em> refers to a sexual dimorphism that is expressed via
white bourgeois categories of man and woman. In its first iteration,
Lugones&rsquo; locution leaves it unclear if gender predated
(post-Medieval) European colonialism (e.g., she refers to Indigenous
&ldquo;third genders&rdquo;) or if gender itself originated with
(post-Medieval) European colonialism. In its later iterations, Lugones
is quite clear that gender&mdash;by which she means the atomic,
homogenous, separable categories &ldquo;man&rdquo; and
&ldquo;woman&rdquo; which obey categorial, dichotomous, and
hierarchical logic&mdash;belongs to and originates with
(post-Medieval) European colonial power. Lugones argues that, through
colonization, colonized peoples are attributed sex, but not gender.
This is to say that peoples colonized during this period are
categorized as males or females in a dehumanized, animalized sense but
they are &ldquo;non-gendered,&rdquo; an assertion reminiscent of
Spillers&rsquo; &ldquo;ungendered&rdquo; (Lugones 2010: 743; 2012: 73;
Spillers 2003: 68). &ldquo;No women are colonized&rdquo;, Lugones
baldly insists, &ldquo;no colonized females are women&rdquo; (2010:
745; 2012: 75). Ultimately, &ldquo;gender is a colonial
imposition&rdquo;, she concludes (2010: 748; 2012: 78) that is
always&nbsp;denied to colonized peoples (if also enforced on them). As
such, Lugones renounces the longstanding coalitional term <em>women of
color</em> and embraces instead <em>decolonial feminism</em>.</p>

<p>
Lugones&rsquo; account opens a series of questions central to trans
philosophy. First, given Lugones&rsquo; definition of gender, we must
ask if in fact <em>gender</em> refers properly to binary gender
categories or if it can (and how might it) refer to something else?
Does (binary) gender originate in (post-Medieval) European
colonization of the Americas, and what is its relationship to a much
earlier (often crusading) Christianity and other religious investments
in gender difference? What has happened (and what might happen) to
gender in the fractures of colonial institutions? And what does it
mean to decolonize gender? Second, given that Lugones did not generate
her account from within trans community and history, we must ask where
trans, Two Spirit, and gender variant people stand in relation to the
coloniality of gender. &ldquo;Gender does not travel away from
colonial modernity&rdquo;, Lugones writes (2010: 746). Critic Brooklyn
Leo (2020), however, insists that gender variant colonized peoples
have, repeatedly, traveled away from colonial genders, thereby opening
up new possibilities for flesh and world. Surely this is also true of
gender variant peoples within Europe itself&mdash;a possibility
neither Lugones nor Leo acknowledge. Colonial genders are always
already being undone from without and from within. Third, insofar as
<em>trans</em> and <em>transgender</em> are Canadian and US-centric
terms which have been exported to apply to all gender variant peoples
across history and the globe, must we not also reckon with the
coloniality of <em>transgender</em> (binaohan 2014; DiPietro
forthcoming)? From one vantage point, transness frustrates
whiteness/coloniality, and participates in a decolonial, liberatory
project. From another, transness participates in a colonial
consolidation of gender variance, identity, language, and history that
itself suppresses, if not actively erases, rich alternative
conceptualizations and practices of being embodied otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="MediGend">4.2 Medicalization of Gender</h3>

<p>
Another crucial site of institutional critique for trans philosophy is
the medicalization of gender, especially through what has come to be
called the medical industrial complex. Early critique of trans life
(Raymond 1979; Hausman 1995), for example, cast trans people as dupes
of the medical establishment (think medical transition icons Christine
Jorgensen or Loren Cameron). Trans people have long been critical,
however, of the medical, psychiatric, and psychological oversight
required to receive sex reassignment surgery and hormone replacement
therapy. Such a critique first requires analyzing the social
structures that condition doctors, clinics, and hospitals offering
said resources to gate-keep for patients of a certain class and,
especially quite early on, patients who were most likely to pass as
cisgender post-treatment. Second, it requires analyzing the
terminology inherited from psychiatry, such as <em>gender
identity</em>, <em>disorder</em>, and <em>dysphoria</em>, and their
effects on and within trans communities. Third, it requires
deconstructing the normative trans narratives generated within,
circulated through, and policed by medical and psychiatric
practitioners (e.g., that I have <em>always</em> felt like, always
wanted, always been, etc.). At a global and transnational level, such
a critique also requires reckoning with the ways in which trans
medicine (and the ideals of trans embodiment it supports) often
enforces racist and ableist norms (Pitts 2024). Those norms also help
produce &ldquo;less suspicious&rdquo; trans subjects, less likely to
trigger a surveillance system trained to register anomalies, itself
part of a racial and security project (Beauchamp 2019). Finally, it
requires tracking these medical processes (not only surgery and
hormones, but clothing, gear, and reproductive options) around the
globe and noting their complicity with colonialism (Aizura 2018).</p>

<p>
There are, of course, other models of trans subjectivity, and other
relationships to body experimentation, that are not reducible to
normative models of medical transition. Narratives have long
circulated within trans communities, especially in early transgender
theorizing, autobiographies, and creative projects, of the cyborg, the
monster, the extra-terrestrial, the hybrid, the mestiza, the border
denizen, the gender outlaw, the gendernaut, etc. (Haraway 1985;
Anzald&uacute;a 1987; Bornstein 1994; Stryker 1994). These narratives
offer a counterpoint to the medicalized discourse of becoming an
identifiable woman or an identifiable man. They capitalize on a truth
at the heart of trans and that is not its categorical destination but
its disruptive journey. Some interpretations of trans people,
especially of what are being termed &ldquo;binary trans&rdquo; people
today, collapse trans people into simply new women or men, erasing the
disruption (and radical revolution) of their movement itself. Early
trans narratives that emphasize the do-it-yourself pastiche of gender
transition (Gill-Peterson 2022), the basic constructedness of the
human body (Stone 1987; Preciado 2008 [2013], 2011 [2018]; Malatino
2024), and the unstable temporality of trans becoming resist this bent
(Spade 2013; Malatino 2019). So, too, do more recent accounts of trans
ecologies (Hayward 2008, 2010; see also
 <a href="#TranEcol">section 4.6</a>),
 or neogenders and xenogenders that appeal to realist and mythical
flora, fauna, and celestial bodies as models of the gender disruptive
creature. These and other narratives refuse to bow to medical
normalization, and instead use medicine, prosthetics, textiles,
affects, and gestures to explore non-normative forms of gendered
embodiment.</p>

<h3 id="TranMarxMate">4.3 Trans Marxism and Materialism</h3>

<p>
Trans Marxism, as developed by Leslie Feinberg (1998), Jordy Rosenberg
(2021), Jules Gleeson and Elle O&rsquo;Rouke (2021a), McKenzie Wark
(2020, 2023), and others, is the jointure of trans theory and Marxist
politics. It takes a historical materialist approach to class struggle
and social reproduction, especially as it relates to non-normative
genders. Such an approach requires attending to gender non-conformity
in a capitalist context. How does the Western gender binary system
coincide with wealth and specifically a ruling bourgeois class? And
how does the perpetuation of that class inform rates of trans labor
alienation, employment discrimination, poverty, incarceration and
institutionalization, and exposure to environmental hazards? What are
the conditions of trans wage labor (from tech to sex work), but also
trans unwaged labor such as affective labor and care work? How does
economic austerity affect trans communities differently? Of course,
granting that &ldquo;trans&rdquo; participates in, as much as resists,
the political economy in which it sits, it is equally important to ask
how, where, and when trans life has become a capitalist commodity,
something marketable and productive for specific institutions and
political factions. What are the modes of production&mdash;and
exploitation&mdash;that mark the hormone/pharmaceutical industry, the
gender clinic, as well as the global circuit of trans healthcare and
trans aesthetics? In the academic context, how has trans
studies&rsquo; educational elitism, division of intellectual labor,
and reproduction of trans knowledges sustained capitalist feelings,
attachments, and forms of organization? And what does revolutionary
organizing look like in this context? What does it mean for trans
people and communities to lean into the unproductivity of their
bodies, the value generated in community, and the disordered
structures of queer and trans sociality (O&rsquo;Brien 2023)?</p>

<p>
Important work is also being done to connect trans theory with the
materialism of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. From its inception,
trans studies has drawn key theoretical resources from Deleuze and
Guattari (1972 [1983], 1972 [1987]) such as
&ldquo;deterritorialization&rdquo;, the &ldquo;molar&rdquo; and
&ldquo;molecular&rdquo;, and &ldquo;schizoanalysis&rdquo;, to name
just a few (Stryker 2008a). In recent years, through the work of Ciara
Cremin (2017, 2021, 2022), Mat Fournier (2014, 2022), Abraham Weil
(2022), Jasbir Puar (2017), Lucas Crawford (2015), and others, that
early riffing has deepened into sustained theorization. First, the
body has been and continues to be &ldquo;territorialized&rdquo; by
norms of gender and sexuality: this body part means <em>X</em> and
must only be used in <em>Y</em> ways with <em>Z</em> person(s). Much
like queerness, transness has the potential to
&ldquo;deterritorialize&rdquo; the body, or rearrange what body parts
mean, how they are used, with whom, and even what they actually are.
Second, gender can be understood at the molar level (or the level of
Being) as &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo;, but it can also, and more
usefully, be understood at the molecular level (or the level of
Becoming). From this vantage point, transness is not so much a
definable thing as it is a structure of variability. Finally,
schizoanalysis aims to replace binarism with heterogeneity. From this
vantage point, a problem, a question, a group, or a project is always
becoming more complex&mdash;and therefore open to continual renewal
and recreation. As such, some have interpreted the project of trans
theory&mdash;and by extension trans philosophy&mdash;to be
schizoanalytic, frustrating the binaristic normative scripts, rooted
in capitalism, patriarchy, and ableism, and opening up possibilities
for greater heterogeneity and complexity.</p>

<h3 id="TranTranNecr">4.4 Transphobia and Trans Necropolitics</h3>

<p>
Although it is not an institution itself, transphobia can become so
sedimented within institutions as to structure their discourses and
material functions. But what is transphobia to begin with? While
definitions vary, outlines largely coalesce. Transphobia may refer to
negative attitudes individual people hold toward trans people, or it
may refer to the social structures that systematically disadvantage
trans people. As such, transphobia is an individual and collective
comportment (Bettcher 2014a). Harms happens to trans people
<em>qua</em> trans people. Transphobia fuels these actualized harms,
as much as the harms that hang in the air&mdash;harms that could
happen at any moment, under the right conditions. There are
transphobic feelings (e.g., unsettledness, heebee-jeebees, disgust, or
hatred when met with a trans person) and there are transphobic beliefs
(e.g., that trans people are morally wrong, &ldquo;mentally
sick&rdquo;, or socially dangerous). Whether fueled by feelings or
beliefs, transphobia arguably stems from a conviction that gender
presentation ought to align with and, in fact, flag one&rsquo;s birth
sex (Bettcher 2007, forthcoming). It may also involve a perception of
transgressive gender presentation as inherently aggressive, as if it
were thrown around or thrown in your face. As such, transphobia is a
comportment that attaches to comportment&mdash;to gender non-normative
steps, swishes, and stomp-shuffles (Salamon 2018). Individually, it
may produce looking away, verbal harassment, physical assault, and
even murder. Socially, it may produce binary restrooms, M and F
registration forms, and medical malpractice, and have the effect of
increasing trans dropout rates, poverty, and sex work. Transphobia is
also inextricable from the settler colonial, racist, and (endo)sexist
systems undergirding gender enforcement today (Bettcher 2007,
forthcoming). While transphobia hammers away at many people, trans and
non-trans people included, however, they are chipping away at it in
turn (Ahmed 2016).</p>

<p>
While there is a kind of violence done to trans life that involves
expulsion or outright abuse, there is another kind of violence done
that involves surveillance and use. Building on Michel
Foucault&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;visibility is a trap&rdquo; (1975
[1977: 200]), trans theorists explore the ways in which trans
visibility, too, can be a trap. Representation is no simple sign of
social progress toward trans inclusion. The coincidence of the
&ldquo;trans tipping point&rdquo; (<em>Time Magazine</em> 2014) and
continuously heightening anti-trans violence and legislation cannot be
ignored. Indeed, there is a fundamental contradiction within
&ldquo;trans visibility&rdquo; (Gossett, Stanley, &amp; Burton 2017a:
xix). While affording greater representation, trans visibility also
folds trans people more deeply into the social structures that
condition their lives (i.e., biopolitics) and put their deaths in the
service of state power (i.e., necropolitics). Increased representation
involves increased surveillance; and increased recognition involves
increased capture. As C. Riley Snorton and Jin Haritaworn (2013)
argue, moreover, the proliferation of slow death and social death
among trans people is especially pronounced in the case of trans
people of color, whose lives are routinely diminished while their
deaths are memorialized and circulated in ways that serve white
feelings and interests. It is in recognition of the operation of
optics, so to speak, that Eric Stanley (2017) invokes, &aacute; la
&Eacute;douard Glissant (1990 [1997]), a trans &ldquo;right to
opacity&rdquo;. If being named and seen, tracked and counted, clocked
and targeted, remembered and recirculated puts trans in a visual
economy that has cis norms and state interests at heart, then refusing
visibility may be the better part of freedom.</p>

<h3 id="IssuLawPoli">4.5 Issues of Law and Policy</h3>

<p>
Trans philosophy analyzes the institution of law as it relates to the
lives of trans and gender disruptive people. It interrogates the
nature of law as an administrative apparatus, the sex/gender norms
that inform and are informed by specific laws, and the legal
precedents, concepts, and applications that most affect trans
populations. Insofar as the administration of sex/gender occurs as
much through mundane bureaucracies, forms, and protocols, moreover, as
it does through Supreme Court rulings, analysis is best activated on
multiple registers. Scholars working in this area have been concerned,
by turns, with issues of bias, discrimination, and violence, as well
as trans panic defenses (Bettcher 2007; Salamon 2018) and conversion
therapies (Ashley 2022); sex segregation practices in public
accommodations (especially bathrooms), housing shelters, domestic
violence shelters, sports competitions, and prisons; and changing
protocols for identity documents, nondiscrimination clauses,
employment equity, sex work, and trans healthcare provisions
(including hormones, surgery, and reproductive rights). Such work
ultimately focuses on three major questions. First, what are the
relevant laws and policies actually doing? Here attention has turned
to the logics that govern sex segregation from the outset (Zurn 2019),
as well as to the ways that sex segregation (and sex classification)
enacts, entrenches, and/or challenges state projects (Salamon 2010;
Draz 2019; Currah 2022). Second, are those laws best reformed or
dismantled? Scholars have investigated the limits of law, rights
frameworks, and legal reform when it comes to trans flourishing,
arguing that neoliberal policy work merely tinkers with a largely
harmful system rather than deeply transforming it through grassroots
social movements (Spade 2011 [2015]). Finally, what does legal
backlash against such efforts illuminate about the function of
&ldquo;trans&rdquo; in our political landscape (Cannon 2022)?</p>

<p>
As trans advocacy has grown, questions about what gets instituted in
trans-affirming, or trans-inclusive, or trans-ameliorative law and
policy projects have become more pertinent. With a long history of
homonormativity (or the institution of norms governing queerness), it
is argued, a critical stance has to be taken to trans normativity (and
the norms instituted around transness). Merely pro-trans policies,
especially for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and therefore mainstreamed trans
subjects, are not, in and of themselves, liberatory. As one example,
consider the increasing availability of third gender (i.e.,
&ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo;) options on driver&rsquo;s licenses,
passports, and other identification documents. Of concern here is the
solidification of a ternary gender system (or a binary system plus one
narrow gender disruptive category: nonbinary) which still delimits the
gender autonomy and multiplicity characteristic of the trans community
and retains the demand that gender be legible and registrable. More
substantively, perhaps, consider the increasingly widespread legal
redefinition of sex as &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo;. In Argentina,
this redefinition occurred in one fell swoop with the 2012 Gender
Identity Law (De Mauro Rucovsky 2019). In the US, the process has been
more piecemeal, including the 2017 California Gender Recognition Act
(which anchors sex designations in self-identification) (Draz 2019)
and the 2020 Bostock ruling (which extends Title IX protections to
gender identity and expression) (Draz 2019; Kohler-Hausmann &amp;
Dembroff 2019; Cannon 2022). The concern here is that the collapse of
gender identity into legal sex both capitulates too much to the
medico-juridical primacy of sex and empties trans genders of the rich
layers of relationality and embodiment that exceed mere
&ldquo;identification&rdquo; discourses (Ben-Asher 2024). Given the
politicization of trans life in law and policy today, these questions
will only proliferate. What will remain important is to remember the
dialectical relationship between changing policies/practices and
changing hearts/minds. It has been argued that whatever trans activism
looks like on the legal stage, it must be guided by a correlative
commitment to nurture the trans poetics of community-building and
aesthetic creation that precedes and transcends legislation (Zurn
forthcoming-a).</p>

<h3 id="TranEcol">4.6 Trans Ecology</h3>

<p>
While the majority of trans philosophy is centered in trans and gender
disruptive/creative people and is therefore anthropocentric, a robust
strand of thinking critiques the institutionalization of
anthropocentrism in gender discourse. This strand creates
opportunities for critical conversations between trans philosophy, on
the one hand, and environmental philosophy and new materialism, on the
other. Stryker, Paisley Currah, and Lisa Jean Moore (2008a) argue that
the hyphenated prefix <em>trans-</em> cannot be reduced either to
gender or to human experience; it is instead always already unmoored
among multiple registers of beings, from the biomaterial to the
biopolitical. This invites us to think trans- not only as a movement
across institutions (and systems) but also between species (Hayward
2008, 2010). <em>Trans-</em>, then, becomes a cipher for <em>becoming
trans</em>, or moving across striated categories rather than being one
of those categories (Puar 2017; Weil 2022). From this vantage point,
transness not only challenges the gender binary but also a range of
binaries, including, perhaps most fundamentally, the binaries of
human/animal and animacy/inanimacy (DiPietro forthcoming). As
developed by Mel Chen in their book <em>Animacies</em> (2012) and
subsequent commentary (Chen in Chen &amp; Hayward 2015),
&ldquo;tranimacy&rdquo; signals the unsettling of these distinctions,
which are both logically impossible and politically trenchant. Against
the intimately conjoined de-animating forces of racism, speciesism,
and cisheteronormativity, Chen pits a profligate animacy that
enlivens, precisely, those otherwise made-inanimate, made-object,
made-thing. Moves such as this can produce trans ecologies of
belonging that frustrate especially settler colonial hierarchies of
being (Steinbock, Szczygielska, &amp; Wagner 2017; Vakoch 2020; Hazard
2022).</p>

<h2 id="FutuTranPhil">5. Futures of Trans Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Having outlined a history (or histories) of trans philosophy and
sketched some of the present contours of trans philosophy, especially
as taken up in the Americas, it is incumbent now to turn to a
consideration of the future (or futures) of trans philosophy. Much
like other so-called philosophies of difference, trans philosophy
cultivates a rich landscape of philosophical issues and methods that,
otherwise, would go undeveloped. But that cultivation, especially at
this juncture in its admittedly early trajectory, may not be without
growing pains. On a scene of increased trans visibility, as well as
anti-trans sentiment and legislation, trans and gender variant life
remains under attack and in question on a sociopolitical register.
Trans philosophy has the opportunity not only to model how to take
trans life seriously, but also to recognize and honor the wisdom of
trans and gender disruptive/creative people. In the profession, trans
philosophy may, again much like its sibling projects, continue to face
the double bind of being perceived as a cutting-edge new subfield
<em>and</em> as not serious or rigorous philosophy, as lacking the
gravitas and solemn personages of agreed upon canons and histories.
However, insofar as trans philosophy remains accountable to and
illuminative of trans experiences, histories, cultural productions,
and politics; insofar as it engages in experiential, institutional,
and self-critique; insofar as it acknowledges the non-universal
character of trans experience and the multiplicity of gender
disruptive/creative histories; and insofar as it remains committed to
an extra-academic stance, not only the standpoint but the stand-places
of gender variant communities, trans philosophy may maintain the
necessary wherewithal to negotiate these choppy waters, both
politically and professionally (Zurn forthcoming-b). In doing so, it
may continue to open philosophy not only to new topics and new
directions, but to new methodologies, interdisciplinary
collaborations, and community-accountable, real-world matterings.</p>

<p>
While trans philosophy to date has been practiced and understood as
largely centered in and beholden to trans people themselves, it is
possible that future iterations of trans philosophy will
expand&mdash;as trans studies has done&mdash;to explore the phenomenon
of transing itself. As developed in trans studies, transing refers to
the movement by which supposedly fixed entities are crossed, blurred,
and unsettled (Stryker, Currah, &amp; Moore 2008a; Aizura et al.
2020). Philosophizing that slippage and leakage is a project still to
be undertaken. But transing need not only be a philosophical topic; it
also has the potential to be a philosophical method. As Tey Meadow
(2016: 322) has argued, &ldquo;trans* epistemology&rdquo; does not
know in advance how it is that we come to know trans people, but
rather advocates for a &ldquo;relational, contingent, iterative,
deeply important, life-giving, infinitely complex&rdquo; process in
which the epistemological subject is kept open and consistently
redrawn. If trans signals a fundamental instability&mdash;an
unboundedness and unfixedness&mdash;in things, then trans philosophy
may involve thinking less the structure of being than becoming.
Refusing restriction to trans terminology as deployed in the last
three decades, it may take &ldquo;trans-&rdquo; as a line of flight to
still other slippages and cracks. In doing so, it may craft a space of
belonging for multiple communities that disrupt normative linkages and
presumptions of universality. However far that project of
<em>trans-</em> philosophy might expand, however, the commitments of
trans philosophy insist it remain meaningfully tethered both to the
struggles of trans and gender disruptive/creative people on the
ground, as well as to critiques of &ldquo;trans&rdquo; as a dominating
concept among gender variant peoples. The most capacious version of
trans philosophy may also be committed beyond theorizing to
cultivating trans care networks (Marvin 2019b; Malatino 2020), in and
beyond the academy.</p>

<p>
Perhaps this tension between the usefulness of &ldquo;trans&rdquo; and
its inherent limitations, the expansiveness of trans and the
specificity of trans communities, the discursive untethering of trans
from and the material grounding of trans in gender disruptive peoples,
is precisely the uneasy but necessary home of trans philosophy. Trans
philosophical work would then be located, attentively and accountably,
in those crossings, those slips, those sideways relations (cp.
DiPietro forthcoming).</p>
