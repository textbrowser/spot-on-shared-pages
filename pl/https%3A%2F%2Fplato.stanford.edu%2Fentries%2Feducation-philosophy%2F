<p>
Philosophy of education was a prominent aspect of the philosophy of
human affairs that emerged in fourth century BCE Athens, and it has
remained an integral aspect of philosophy through much of its
subsequent history (Rorty 1998; Curren 2018; Laverty &amp; Hansen
2023). It established itself as a distinct subfield of philosophy in
the 1960s (Peters 1973a; Doyle 1973; Kominsky 1993), and its growth
since the 1980s has been dramatic (Hirst &amp; White 1998; Curren
2003, 2023a; Siegel 2009; Bailey et al. 2010; Phillips 2014; Smith
2015).</p>

<p>
Overviews of philosophy of education have adopted a variety of
approaches. One approach has been to present it as a field of
competing philosophical orientations or philosophies of education (N.
Henry 1942, 1955; Passmore 1980: 3&ndash;7). A second approach has
been to group works in philosophy of education according to the
related subfields of philosophy from which they draw resources (Soltis
1981). A third approach has been topical, using different aspects of
education as the organizing basis for the field (Peters 1973a).
Hybrids of these approaches and historical overviews have also
appeared (e.g., Blake et al. 2003; Siegel 2009).</p>

<p>
No overview using any of these approaches can proceed without some
conception of the object of study, any more than philosophy of science
or philosophy of law can be defined and surveyed without a working
conception of what science or law is. Philosophical efforts to
demarcate science, law, and education&mdash;to clarify their natures
by distinguishing them from other human endeavors&mdash;are a
foundational aspect of the enterprise. As human endeavors, all three
have natures that may be defined in part by specific practices and in
part by purposes, aims, or aspirations. They are all highly
institutionalized, diverse in the forms they take, and shape the ways
we live. Important questions arise concerning the relationships
between education, law, and science as institutions, as well as the
relationships between education and other basic institutions: the
family, economy, and religion. The questions concerning these
relationships are to some extent normative, to some extent empirical,
and to some extent matters of social ontology.</p>

<p>
Philosophy of education is thus concerned not only with philosophical
questions about education as such but with larger questions of
education policy and the roles of educational institutions in
societies. This entry adopts a topical approach organized around the
nature of education and the kinds of normative questions that arise
concerning education.</p>

<h2 id="ObjInqMosBasQue">1. The Object of Inquiry and Most Basic Questions</h2>

<p>
The natural point of departure for philosophical investigations of
education is a pre-theoretical identification of educational practices
and the assumptions and aspirations, aims, or purposes that guide
them. Education may be broadly characterized as the promotion of
desirable forms of learning and personal development through practices
that would provisionally include:</p>

<ol>

<li><em>supervision</em> of study, exploration, experimentation,
collaboration, play, and other forms of exertion of abilities through
which desirable forms of learning and development typically
occur;</li>

<li><em>instruction</em> or <em>teaching</em>;</li>

<li><em>coaching</em>, which combines supervision of practice,
diagnosis of limitations of performance, and targeted
instruction;</li>

<li><em>habituation</em> associated with coaching, supervision, and
structuring of learning environments and activities;</li>

<li><em>evaluation</em> associated with all of these;</li>

<li><em>mentoring</em> and <em>counseling</em>;</li>

<li><em>motivational</em> and <em>disciplinary</em> (i.e.,
<em>correctional</em>) aspects of supervision, instruction, and
coaching (cf. Hirst &amp; Peters 1970: 19).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Education involving any number of these practices may occur more or
less informally in diverse settings.</p>

<p>
The institutionalization of education embeds such practices in
para-educational practices that have become highly professionalized,
notably:</p>

<ol start="8">

<li>management of educational institutions;</li>

<li>educational policy making;</li>

<li>curriculum development;</li>

<li>production of knowledge, including the evidential basis for
educational policy making;</li>

<li>student and community life practices (e.g., fairs, clubs,
sports);</li>

<li>occupational certification, credentialing, and placement in
internships and jobs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are many questions about these educational and para-educational
practices that are at least partly philosophical. As human practices
with significance for the interests of everyone in the society, there
are obviously ethical questions at stake, including questions of
justice. A high-level typology of the kinds of ethical questions at
stake can be predicated on the fact that supervision or governance of
the activities of learners is a pervasive aspect of education. If
there are distinct normative aspects of governance, there will be
corresponding normative aspects of education. These arguably (Curren
2007; cf. White 1995a: 216) pertain to the:</p>

<ol>

<li><em>aims</em> of education;</li>

<li><em>content</em> of education or what is communicated through
institutional structure, norms, rules, and curricula;</li>

<li><em>manner and methods</em> of education (e.g., pedagogy,
evaluation, and classroom management);</li>

<li>grounds, limits, and distribution of educational
<em>authority</em>;</li>

<li>educational <em>responsibilities</em>, with respect to adequacy,
equality, inclusion, and student well-being.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The five basic questions about the conduct of education are thus: What
are its aims? What should its content be? How, or in what manner,
should it be carried out? How is educational authority to be assigned?
What responsibilities does educating entail?</p>

<p>
Answers to these normative questions about education typically begin
in conceptions of the nature of education, but they often rest on
philosophical, empirical, and hybrid claims about human development,
rationality, well-being, freedom, motivation, virtues, knowledge,
understanding, language, communication, cooperation, measurement,
expertise, democracy, a just society, work, and other matters. The
pursuit of normative questions about education thereby leads one to
further questions that are largely philosophical but spill over into
psychology, sociology, psychometrics, political science, economics,
and other disciplines. Philosophy of education thus stands at a
complex intersection of philosophical sub-fields and other
disciplines. It can choose to keep concrete matters of educational
policy and practice at arms-length, but the trend in recent years has
been toward actionable ethical analysis, sometimes referred to as
&ldquo;non-ideal theorizing&rdquo; about educational justice
(Brighouse, Ladd, et al. 2018; Levinson 2023b; Levinson &amp; Fay
2016, 2019; Levinson &amp; Theisen-Homer 2015; Levinson, Geron et al.
2024; Levinson, Reid et al. 2024; Schouten &amp; Brighouse 2015; Swift
2008; Taylor &amp; Kuntz 2021). It can similarly choose to sidestep
the empirical questions, but it is no coincidence that another trend
in recent years has been toward scholarship that is more empirically
informed, cross-disciplinary, and collaborative than in the past.</p>

<h2 id="NatAimEdu">2. The Nature and Aims of Education</h2>

<p>
There was a time, in the 1960s and 70s, when philosophers of education
devoted much of their attention to analyzing the nature or concept of
education. Richard S. Peters, the leading light in philosophy of
education in the U.K. at the time, held that education is concerned
with the transmission of worthwhile things and what distinguishes it
from, on the one hand, training and, on the other hand, mere growth is
that education promotes the development of students&rsquo; minds and
their appreciation of what is valuable, through voluntary initiation
into</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
modes of conduct and thought which have standards written into them by
reference to which it is possible to act, think, and feel with varying
degrees of skill, relevance and taste. (Peters 1965 [2007: 65]; cf.
Oakeshott 1971)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What Peters envisioned was students being able to see, understand, and
appreciate the world in powerful ways through the conceptual,
analytical, and constructive resources of arts and sciences. He also
envisioned students becoming willing participants in the ongoing life
of the traditions of practice and inquiry into which they are
initiated, carrying those traditions forward and revising the existing
standards as reasons to do so come to light (cf. Scheffler 1973). They
should become willing and capable participants in the
&ldquo;conversation&rdquo; of mankind, as Michael Oakeshott (1959) put
it. Conceiving of education in this way, Peters argued that it cannot
be fully justified instrumentally through the further benefits to
individuals or societies it might yield, but he acknowledged some
doubt as to whether it could be fully justified non-instrumentally
through the inherent rewards of inquiry and cultural
pursuits&mdash;&ldquo;goods which are constitutive of a worth-while
level of life&rdquo; (Peters 1973b: 247). Peters was grappling with
something like Aristotle&rsquo;s conception of a liberal education
(Nussbaum 1997; Nightingale 2001) and the &ldquo;Aristotelian
Hypothesis&rdquo; on which it rested&mdash;the hypothesis that the
most admirable pursuits, which he took to be forms of theoretical or
scientific inquiry, are also the most truly pleasant or rewarding
(Reeve 2012). The most worthwhile life, or life most objectively and
subjectively fulfilling for a human being or community, would be the
defining or (alternatively) most ethically appropriate purpose of
education.</p>

<p>
Peters&rsquo; collaborator, Paul Hirst, framed a related conception of
<em>liberal education</em> as initiation into forms of knowledge
(Hirst 1965) but later retreated from this to a more expansive
conception of education as initiation into human practices (Hirst
1993). In framing the latter view, he relied on Alasdair
MacIntyre&rsquo;s (1981) conception of a practice (i.e., &ldquo;any
coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human
activity&rdquo; [1981: 175]) and goods internal to practices (i.e.,
goods attainable only in achieving &ldquo;standards of excellence
which are appropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of
activity&rdquo; [1981: 175]). This yielded a less elitist&mdash;though
still problematic (Hager 2011)&mdash;view of the worthwhile lives for
which students might be prepared, as well as the idea that integrity
in teaching involves fidelity to the goods internal to practices into
which students are initiated (Strike 2003). However, the dominant
focus of the ensuing discussion of education as initiation into
practices was the question of whether teaching itself is a practice
involving internal goods that warrant a granting of professional
autonomy for teachers because such goods can only be appreciated by
those engaged in the practice (MacIntyre &amp; Dunne 2002; Dunne 2003;
Higgins 2003; Hogan &amp; Smith 2003). MacIntyre insisted that
teaching is not a practice, others mostly disagreed, but the lesson of
the debate is arguably that MacIntyre&rsquo;s way of distinguishing
&ldquo;internal&rdquo; and &ldquo;external&rdquo; goods obscured the
relationships between the inherent goods or aims of
education&mdash;goods or aims without which it would not be
education&mdash;and the further goods or purposes that might be
achieved through education (Hager 2011). Surveying the economic and
civic aims that are often attributed to educational systems, Peters
(1965) argued unpersuasively that all such talk of aims is confused,
much as many have characterized liberal education as simply
&ldquo;learning for learning&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;&mdash;learning
motivated by the intrinsic or non-instrumental value of knowing, or
the intrinsic or non-instrumental value of activities of learning or
inquiry, or the intrinsic or non-instrumental value of cultural
achievements that students may come to appreciate. Yet, there is no
obvious reason why education could not involve inherent goods or aims
and also justifiably serve further student-centered aims, public aims,
or both.</p>

<p>
Related debates about the nature of education and idea of an educated
person have played out in other work on liberal education (e.g.,
Nussbaum 1997, 2004, 2010) and a primarily German literature of
<em>Bildung</em>, or self-realization and wisdom acquired through
&ldquo;culture&rdquo; or the sciences, arts, and philosophy (Wood
1998; P. Watson 2010; Bakhurst 2011; Stojanov 2018a, 2018c). Both of
these literatures accept the multiplicity of goods, purposes, or aims
that might be achieved through education, much as Aristotle did in
holding that the multi-faceted purpose of education is to equip the
members of a society to live as partners in a flourishing life&mdash;a
purpose served by cultivating intellectual virtues that are enacted in
a flourishing life, virtues sufficient for collective wisdom in civic
partnership in living well, and dispositions and bonds of civic
friendship (Curren 2023b). Martha Nussbaum distinguishes an older
conception of education that is liberal (<em>liberalis</em>;
&ldquo;fitted for freedom&rdquo;) from a newer one, the older being an
uncritical initiation of a small elite into the cultural traditions
prized by their parents and the newer being a cultivation of ability
to think for oneself that prepares rich and poor alike for collective
self-governance (Nussbaum 1997). The latter, Socratic, form of liberal
higher education is under attack today in the few countries where it
exists, and Nussbaum&rsquo;s defense of it embraces a multicultural
preparation for global citizenship to address the global problems we
all face (Nussbaum 1997, 2010; cf. Culp 2019; Kitcher 2021).</p>

<p>
If education is the promotion of desirable forms of learning and
personal development through instructional and supervisory practices,
it could have non-instrumental formative aims and also be expected to
serve any number of instrumental individual (i.e., student-centered)
and collective (i.e., civic, social, or economic) aims. Numerous
questions arise concerning the nature, justification, prioritizing,
compatibility, and harmonizing of educational aims.</p>

<h3 id="ForAim">2.1 Formative Aims</h3>

<p>
There are three distinguishable non-instrumental grounds on which
formative aims of education have been defended. We can think of these
as the <em>inherent aim</em>, <em>categorical imperative</em>, and
<em>intrinsic goods</em> approaches. The inherent aim approach
identifies a formative aim as an inherent or defining aspect of
education as such. The categorical imperative approach identifies a
formative aim as fulfillment of a non-instrumental, or categorical,
imperative (i.e., duty) of educating. The intrinsic goods approach
identifies a candidate aim (such as a virtue, epistemic good, or
fulfillment of potential) as intrinsically valuable.</p>

<h4 id="InhAimApp">2.1.1 The Inherent Aim Approach</h4>

<p>
There are versions of the inherent aim approach that offer variations
on Peters&rsquo; idea that it is through education that minds develop.
One might argue that it is through education broadly conceived that
human beings are able to function in &ldquo;the space of
reasons&rdquo; (McDowell 1994 [1996]; Bakhurst 2011, 2020), be
appropriately moved by reasons (Siegel 1988, 2003, forthcoming), or
believe and act in light of reasons. One might argue that it is
through education that human beings become self-conscious persons able
to know what they think and are doing (R&ouml;dl 2020; Bakhurst 2023).
Or one might argue that it is through education that human beings
develop capabilities essential to having minds of their own and living
with dignity (Nussbaum 2004, 2011). These arguments provide plausible
grounds for regarding education as having an inherently humanizing
character or aim. However, it is hard to say <em>how much</em>
education could be justified on these grounds, if the ability to
function as a rational being, know what one is doing, and have a mind
of one&rsquo;s own is incremental. One could defend the related claim
that being educated inherently involves the acquisition of knowledge
(Hirst &amp; Peters 1970: 19; Siegel 2008; Sockett 2012), but
identifying knowledge as an inherent aim of education would not
resolve this &ldquo;how much&rdquo; question either.</p>

<p>
The growth of culture&mdash;of languages, arts, and
sciences&mdash;augments the space of reasons or domains of knowledge
into which initiation, and with respect to which epistemic agency, are
possible. In expanding the kinds of ideas we can have and act on, it
also broadens the scope of epistemic responsibility we must shoulder
in navigating complex conceptual, social, and built environments,
while deepening our epistemic and practical dependence on experts in
specialized branches of knowledge that we will never have time to
master. The relationships between epistemic <em>autonomy</em>,
epistemic <em>responsibility</em>, and epistemic <em>dependence</em>
are thus important to clarifying epistemic ideals that have been
regarded as inherent aims of education (Robertson forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Philosophical conceptions of epistemic and practical autonomy and
responsibility have been bound up historically with closely linked
conceptions of reason and judgment. As Aristotle was founding a
handful of sciences modeled on geometry, he championed a general
education that would enable a person to judge what is and is not
properly expounded in nearly all subjects but would fall short of
conferring scientific knowledge of all subjects (<em>Parts of
Animals</em> 639a1&ndash;6; Reeve 1998: 58). As Aristotelian sciences
were being discarded in the seventeenth century, Ren&eacute; Descartes
held similarly that universal wisdom is the proper aim of education,
but he defended <em>natural reason</em> as a common possession of
human beings, guide for the conduct of life, and the very form of
reasoning essential to science (see his <em>Rules for the Direction of
the Mind</em>, <em>Discourse on Method</em>, parts I and II, <em>The
Search for Truth by Means of Natural Light</em>, and Dedicatory Letter
to the <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>). Descartes and John Locke
both presented the use of natural reason in examining the basis of
ideas as a natural standard of epistemic diligence in taking
responsibility for the beliefs on which one acts and making them
one&rsquo;s own, or in other words as sufficient for both epistemic
and practical autonomy and responsibility (Locke 1706: &sect; 12). If
autonomy is having and exercising a capacity to take responsibility
for what one thinks, values, and does, natural reason was considered
not only such a capacity but a way to <em>know</em> what is true,
good, and prudent. These early modern views are widely seen as going
astray by radically underestimating the extent of our epistemic
dependence on the collective epistemic labor of others. No one could
possibly have the time or intellectual capacity to adequately judge
for themselves everything pertaining to their daily affairs or to know
all they may wish to know. Attaining epistemic autonomy through an
Aristotelian education in the sciences has meanwhile been pushed ever
farther out of reach by the proliferation of sciences and their roles
in shaping the complex world we navigate.</p>

<p>
A common contemporary response to the realities of epistemic
dependence has been to argue that epistemic autonomy is compatible
with extensive epistemic dependence (Adler 2002; Elgin 2002, 2013,
2022; Siegel 2005; Bakhurst 2014; D. Pritchard 2016b; Fricker 2022).
Accounts of what is sufficient for epistemic autonomy or agency
include good intellectual character (D. Pritchard 2023: 128), or a
combination of epistemic virtue and taking responsibility for
one&rsquo;s beliefs in a way that involves fidelity to an epistemic
counterpart of Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative (Elgin 2013).
Fidelity to this &ldquo;epistemic imperative&rdquo; would involve
believing only what one could accept on the basis of reasons that can
be justified to other members of an epistemic community. A second
response has been to abandon epistemic self-reliance as an educational
aim (Hand 2006), and a third has been to shift the focus from autonomy
to responsibility (Robertson forthcoming), understanding epistemic
responsibility as exertion of &ldquo;controlling intelligence&rdquo;
(Coady 1992: 248) that displays the motivation and skills
characteristic of intellectual virtue. Taking epistemic responsibility
in this sense would involve <em>some</em> thinking for oneself that is
intelligent in the sense of being well informed and thoughtful about
the trustworthiness of epistemic methods, sources, reasoning, and
evidence. It would involve epistemic agency or setting and adhering to
self-imposed rules for determining the basis on which one can endorse
beliefs as one&rsquo;s own. If autonomy is in this way a product of
taking responsibility, then epistemic agency or responsibility might
be seen as the primary educational end.</p>

<h4 id="CatImpApp">2.1.2 The Categorical Imperative Approach</h4>

<p>
The categorical imperative approach to identifying a formative aim as
non-instrumental invokes a duty to respect students as rational
agents. Functioning as a rational being, knowing what one is doing,
and having a mind of one&rsquo;s own all pertain to agency, and as
much to practical rationality as to epistemic rationality. Recognizing
this, one might discern a non-instrumental basis for identifying the
promotion of autonomous rational agency (both practical and epistemic)
as a fundamental aim of education, the argument being that
educators&rsquo; duty of respect for students as rational beings
entails an obligation to cultivate their rationality or ability to be
appropriately moved by reasons. An epistemic variant of this argument
has focused on students&rsquo; development as critical thinkers
(Scheffler 1973; Siegel 1988; 1997: 24&ndash;25, 73&ndash;87; 2016:
108&ndash;109), and a practical variant of it has focused on competent
self-determination (Locke 1690: &sect; 69).</p>

<p>
If there is a threshold of adequacy in such non-instrumentally
justified formative education, it might be conceptualized as the
educational prerequisites for competent self-determination, assigning
primacy to practical rationality and a supporting role to epistemic
rationality. What bodies of knowledge or understanding would be
essential to reaching this threshold is unclear. From a curricular
standpoint, the question is whether fulfilling the fundamental
formative aim of rational empowerment, or competent
self-determination, requires the kind of initiation into forms of
knowledge that Peters envisioned. How much ability to understand the
world in the manner of a biologist, historian, anthropologist,
geographer, economist, psychologist, epidemiologist, or climatologist
can be defended as foundational to competent self-determination or
being competent to manage one&rsquo;s affairs in an immensely complex
world? How much understanding of these and other fields would be
enough to facilitate epistemic responsibility in determining what
sources to trust for guidance on relevant features of the contexts in
which one must make decisions?</p>

<h4 id="IntGooApp">2.1.3 The Intrinsic Goods Approach</h4>

<p>
The intrinsic goods approach is evident in recent work in philosophy
of education stimulated by the virtue epistemology and virtue ethics
movements and related developments in intellectual and moral character
education. It identifies intellectual virtues, moral virtues,
epistemic goods, and fulfillments of potential that partially or fully
constitute human flourishing as intrinsically good, and it defends
these as aims of education on the grounds that they are intrinsically
valuable.</p>

<p>
<em>Intellectual</em> virtue theorists distinguish virtue
<em>reliabilism</em> from virtue <em>responsibilism</em>. Virtue
reliabilism regards intellectual virtues as valuable because they are
reliable sources of truth (e.g., Sosa 1991), which is to say
instrumentally valuable. Virtue responsibilism conceives of
intellectual virtues as analogous to moral virtues, and similar to
them in having intrinsic value and involving love or valuing of
epistemic goods, such as truth, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom
(Zagzebski 1996; Roberts &amp; Wood 2007; Baehr 2011). Responsibilist
intellectual virtue theorists who regard intellectual virtues and
goods as intrinsically valuable can, and sometimes do, identify
virtuous intellectual character, specific intellectual virtues (such
as open-mindedness, intellectual courage, and inquisitiveness), and
epistemic goods (such as truth, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom)
as intrinsic goods that should be pursued as non-instrumental aims of
education.</p>

<p>
In practice, there has been considerable debate about the relative
merits of knowledge (Hirst 1965; Goldman 1999; Adler 2003; Bakhurst
2023), understanding (Elgin 1999, 2007, 2023; D. Pritchard 2013,
2016a), critical thinking (Ennis 1962; Scheffler 1973; McPeck 1981;
Lipman 2003; Siegel 1988, 1997, 2003, 2017), and intellectual virtue
(Baehr 2011, 2016, 2021; Battaly 2006, 2016, 2023; D. Pritchard 2013,
2023) as the primary aim (or primary epistemic aim) of education
(Bakhurst 2023; Robertson 2009b; L. Watson 2016). These may all be
seen as intrinsic goods and as deeply interrelated educational aims,
but also as aims that can pull apart and be justified in a variety of
ways. Knowledge may be foundational to understanding (Bakhurst 2023)
but not confer understanding (Zagzebski 2001; Kvanvig 2003; Elgin
2007, 2023). Understanding may be possible without knowledge (Elgin
1999, 2017), and students may be able to acquire understanding in some
domains of knowledge many years before they could understand the
complexities of evidence in those domains well enough to have
knowledge (Elgin 1999). Knowledge may also be foundational to thinking
critically about the matters addressed in a domain of knowledge
(Peters 1965; McPeck 1981; Siegel 1988), but knowledge without
intellectual virtues (D. Pritchard 2023) or broader skills of critical
thinking and a &ldquo;critical spirit&rdquo; (Siegel 1988, 1997) would
not suffice for epistemic rational agency.</p>

<p>
<em>Moral</em> virtue theorists take a similar path to a
non-instrumental justification of good moral character as an important
aim of education. From a broadly Aristotelian perspective, genuine
moral virtues and a comprehensively morally virtuous state of
character are intrinsically good attributes&mdash;complex cognitive,
perceptual, motivational, emotional, and behavioral dispositions that
involve proper valuing of persons and are coordinated by practical
wisdom (Sherman 1989; Carr &amp; Steutel 1999; Moss 2011;
Kristj&aacute;nsson 2015). From this perspective, morally good
character is hard to tease apart from intellectually and civically
good character, and the nature of practical wisdom and relationships
between moral, intellectual, and civic virtues play important roles in
clarifying the educational aims at stake.</p>

<p>
The nature of practical wisdom has been an object of disagreement
reflecting different readings of Aristotle&rsquo;s pronouncements
about <em>phron&ecirc;sis</em> in <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
(<em>NE</em>) Book VI, and ethics as a science
(<em>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</em>) or foundational component of political
science (<em>h&ecirc; politik&ecirc; epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</em>) in
<em>NE</em> Book I. Some readings have accepted the idea, promoted by
the virtue ethics movement, that Aristotle sees no role for knowledge
of universal moral truths in virtuous decision-making (Nussbaum 1986;
Dunne &amp; Pendlebury 2003), while other readings deny this (Jaeger
1957; Lloyd 1968; Westphal 2012; D. Henry &amp; Nielsen 2015; Curren
&amp; Park 2024). Aristotle describes <em>phron&ecirc;sis</em> as
&ldquo;concerned not only with universals but with particulars, which
become familiar from experience&rdquo; (<em>NE</em> VI.8
1142a13&ndash;15), implying roles for both perception and universal
moral truths in wise decision-making. If moral virtue is an important
aim of education, and practical wisdom is an essential aspect of
genuine moral virtue, then moral knowledge and moral perceptiveness
(i.e., discernment of morally relevant &ldquo;particulars&rdquo; or
aspects of situations) would be sub-aims. This is consistent with
Aristotle&rsquo;s presentation of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
itself as a path from facts (<em>to hoti</em>) that are starting
points of ethical inquiry to ethical <em>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</em> or
science.</p>

<p>
A further notable example of the intrinsic goods approach arises from
the neo-Aristotelian claim that possession of virtues is partially
constitutive of human flourishing. Regarding virtues and flourishing
as intrinsic goods provides the basis for non-instrumental
justifications of not only intellectual character education (D.
Pritchard 2023: 130) and moral character education
(Kristj&aacute;nsson 2015: 8), but also well-being education (Morris
2015). It brings us back to Peters&rsquo; conception of education as
initiation into worthwhile pursuits that make for a worthwhile life.
Initiation into activities of a flourishing life might qualify as an
inherent aim of education on Peters&rsquo; conception of education,
but identifying flourishing as an intrinsic good defends it not as a
defining or inherent aim of education but as an ethically appropriate
one.</p>

<p>
A notable feature of non-instrumentally justified formative education
is that it seems to escape the dilemma, aptly framed by Jean-Jacques
Rousseau (1762 [1979: 37&ndash;42]), of how it can be equally
<em>for</em> the individual student and <em>for</em> the society. By
contrast, instrumental justifications of educational aims may appeal
to the good of the student, the good of the society, or both. The
prospect of tensions between what is good for the individual student
and what is good for the society has long been an animating theme in
philosophy of education.</p>

<h3 id="StuCenAim">2.2 Student-Centered Aims</h3>

<p>
Several student-centered educational aims have been addressed in
recent years. Classifying them as &ldquo;student-centered&rdquo;
identifies them as pertaining to the individual well-being of
students. The term &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; signifies that a life is
going well for the person living it (Parfit 1984; Raz 2004; Tiberius
2008), and since there are several aspects to how a life goes, there
are bound to be a variety of possible aims of education for which
student-centered justifications can be offered.</p>

<p>
In this vein, Harry Brighouse, Helen Ladd, Susanna Loeb, and Adam
Swift identify</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
six capacities that everyone should have in modern societies and which
&hellip; will tend to support the flourishing of both the educated
person and others: the capacities for economic productivity, personal
autonomy, democratic competence, healthy personal relationships,
treating others as equals, and personal fulfillment. (Brighouse, Ladd,
et al. 2018: 22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The significance of most of these capacities for the student&rsquo;s
own well-being is easy to discern. Autonomy is understood as
individuals&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
ability to make and act on well-informed and well-thought-out
judgments about both how to live and what to do in their everyday
lives. (2018: 23)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Democratic competence equips students to protect their interests
through democratic processes (cf., Levinson 2012; Allen &amp; Kidd
2023). Capacity for personal fulfillment equips individuals with
interests and competence that enable them &ldquo;to find joy and
fulfillment&rdquo; in life experiences and activities (Brighouse, Ladd
et al. 2018: 27). Brighouse, Ladd, Loeb, and Swift refer to these
capacities as conducive to &ldquo;the flourishing of both the educated
person and others&rdquo; (2018: 22). Other defenses of flourishing as
an overarching aim of education are similarly sensitive to the
relationship between individual and collective well-being. The
relationship is perhaps most widely perceived with respect to
capacities for economic productivity and mutual benefit in market
transactions, but the identification of flourishing as an overarching
aim of education requires a reconciliation of the individual&rsquo;s
and others&rsquo; opportunities to live well that is as broad as the
education in question. This can show up in how the educational aim is
defined (e.g., as equipping the members of a society to live as
partners in a flourishing life), in how flourishing itself is defined
(e.g., as a life of activity that is both admirable and personally
fulfilling), and in reliance on empirical claims about prerequisites
of human well-being (e.g., that enactment of social virtues is a
necessary condition for happiness).</p>

<p>
Brighouse, Ladd, et al. write that educators aim to instill knowledge,
skills, dispositions, and attitudes (2018: 19), implicitly identifying
these formative &ldquo;educational goods&rdquo; as inherent aims of
education, while holding that &ldquo;what matters, ultimately, is the
creation and distribution of opportunities for people to
flourish&rdquo; (2018: 21). It is appropriate to focus on
<em>opportunities</em> for flourishing, they say, &ldquo;because the
most that educational goods can do is equip people with what they need
for their lives to go well&rdquo; (2018: 21). In saying this, they use
the term &ldquo;flourishing&rdquo; to refer&mdash;as the term
&ldquo;well-being&rdquo; does&mdash;to a life going well, all things
considered, in both its objective and subjective dimensions. This is
typical of recent defenses of flourishing as an overarching aim of
education, in assuming that there is an open-ended variety of ways in
which people can live well and that the task of educators is to
promote learning that facilitates students&rsquo; pursuit of lives
that are personally meaningful and satisfying for them while also
contributing to others being able to live well (Brighouse 2006, 2008;
Curren 2013; de Ruyter 2004, 2007, 2015; de Ruyter &amp; Wolbert 2020;
de Ruyter, Oades, et al. 2022; Kristj&aacute;nsson 2020; Schouten
2023; White 1995b, 2011). Flourishing is typically understood to
involve fulfillment of potential that exhibits admirable qualities and
is personally meaningful, satisfying, and enjoyable (Darwall 1999; de
Ruyter, Oades, et al. 2022; Kraut 2007). Helping students fulfill
their potential in such ways is a common aspiration of teachers, and
the simplest justification for regarding flourishing as an overarching
aim of education is that having this aim in view is indistinguishable
from educating students with a view to their well-being or life-long
interest in living well. Curren, Boniwell et al. (2024) have argued
that shaping students&rsquo; development without this in view is
unethical.</p>

<p>
Critics argue that the open-endedness of ways in which it is possible
to live well implies that aiming to equip students for flourishing
lives is either devoid of actionable content (Carr 2021) or
illegitimately favors a predetermined conception of living well
(Siegel 2015, forthcoming). Another objection is that only things that
are teachable can be aims of education, flourishing is not teachable,
so flourishing is not the kind of thing that can be an aim of
education (Hand forthcoming). A response to this is that educating
with a view to students being able to live better lives than they
could otherwise live is still educating&mdash;it is still promoting
desirable forms of learning and personal development through familiar
kinds of educational practices. The fundamental distinguishing feature
of education for flourishing is its conception of what makes forms of
learning and personal development <em>desirable</em>.</p>

<p>
Alternative conceptualizations of educational goods and capacities
favorable to living well have been proposed, such as Nussbaum and
Amartya Sen&rsquo;s Capability Approach (Nussbaum 2004, 2011;
Unterhalter 2003, 2016; Walker &amp; Unterhalter 2007; Hart &amp;
Brando 2018; Terzi et al. 2023), and debates have played out regarding
student-centered defenses of specific educational aims, such as
autonomy and labor market success. Student-centered defenses of
education for autonomy have rested on affirmations of children&rsquo;s
rights, the instrumental value of autonomy in enabling individuals to
choose lives that can be good ones for them, and its constitutive role
in living well (J. Feinberg 1980). By contrast, John Rawls (1993: 199)
and others have argued that state mandated autonomy education is
inconsistent with civic respect for members of religious sects that
perceive autonomy as alien to their ways of life. One response to this
concern has been to argue that autonomy must be acknowledged as a
political good and &ldquo;providing citizens the means and freedoms to
exercise it&rdquo; is a requirement of justice even in Rawls&rsquo;s
&ldquo;political&rdquo; form of liberalism (Levinson 1999: 22).
Another response concedes that mandating education in robust autonomy
(i.e., engagement in independent reflection and judgment) would not be
legitimate from this political liberal standpoint, but argues that
educational <em>facilitation</em> of autonomy (Brighouse 2000) or
education in a minimal form of autonomy (Reich 2002) would
legitimately secure children&rsquo;s instrumental interest in being
able to critically evaluate their prospects of having a good life if
they accept the conception of a good life with which they have grown
up. A more recent response defends universal education in robust
autonomy by arguing that it is a precondition for all citizens being
able to obtain the fair value of access to the goods that liberal
principles of justice distribute in the interest of fairness in the
opportunities diverse citizens have to live lives that are good for
them (Schouten 2018: 1091).</p>

<p>
While no one disputes the claim that a capacity for economic
productivity is helpful to living well, there has been much debate
regarding specific forms that the aim of labor market success has
taken. Regarding secondary schools, the goal of &ldquo;college for
all&rdquo; has inspired debate, in part because the functional aim is
often to maximize college admission at any cost. Neglect of civic
education, student well-being, and viable alternatives to college have
been identified as important costs to consider (Ben-Porath 2013;
Lamboy &amp; Lu 2017). A related debate is underway regarding a recent
emphasis on colleges and universities having a special role to play in
providing individuals with socio-economic mobility. Here too, there
are costs of upward mobility to students who seek it and to their home
communities, especially for college students who experience cultural
alienation and tensions between their support roles within their
families and pursuing their individual success (Voigt 2017; Laden
2022, 2023, 2024; Morton 2019, 2021b, 2023; Curren 2023c). There are
also civic costs entailed by institutions pitting people against each
other in high-stakes competitions (Hussain 2020) mediated by academic
credentials (Sandel 2020, 2022; Brighouse 2022). It is also arguably
costly to universities themselves to be deflected from the educational
goods of &ldquo;knowledge, personal transformation, and value
acquisition&rdquo; that are &ldquo;inherent to [their] mission&rdquo;
(Morton 2023: 289; cf. Martin 2022; Higgins 2024).</p>

<h3 id="SocCivEcoAim">2.3 Social, Civic, and Economic Aims</h3>

<p>
Schools have been expected to play a variety of civic, social, and
economic aims, from nation building (i.e., civic unification
predicated on a common national identity) and promoting national
security, to eliminating poverty, disease, and crime, to facilitating
economic growth and competitiveness. The dominance of economic aims in
global educational policy in recent decades has been a focus of
critique, as much for what it has eclipsed as for its false promises
and damaging consequences. Debates about the compatibility of these
economic aims with other educational aims, the soundness of their
rationales, and the damaging consequences of their modes of pursuit
are substantially empirical. A founding supposition of the educational
pursuit of economic growth and competitiveness has been that high
rates of economic growth can be sustained for all countries through
high levels of achievement in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Math) education (Hanushek &amp; Woessmann 2010), but there is
evidence suggesting it is impossible to sustain high economic growth
in developed countries with populations that are already highly
educated (Tamir 2023). The use of high-stakes and international
comparative exams in Reading, Math, and Science in an attempt to
compel higher achievement in the interest of economic aims has been
criticized as very costly in its consequences for quality of
instruction and learning, student well-being, teacher demoralization,
and (consequently) teacher shortages (Deci 2009; Ryan &amp; Brown
2005; Pelletier &amp; Sharp 2009; Santoro 2018; Tamir 2023). While
some of the tension between the aim of sustaining economic growth and
other educational aims might be seen as avoidable, a case has been
made for regarding the former as fundamentally at odds with the
existentially important aim of preparing students to engage in global
civic cooperation to address climate destabilization, future
pandemics, and other problems that require globally coordinated
responses (Kitcher 2021, 2023).</p>

<p>
Turning from economic growth and national competitiveness to the role
of knowledge and expertise in public policy and the professions, some
related themes in philosophy of education are the nature and
acquisition of expertise and the role of educational institutions in
the production and dissemination of public knowledge (i.e., knowledge
that is publicly enabled and intended to serve the public interest).
Societies cannot meaningfully address the problems they face without
investing in the creation and dissemination of public knowledge and
the cultivation and certification of related forms of expertise. The
benefits of the resulting <em>epistemic division of labor</em> can be
widely shared if the society is democratic, if certification of
expertise is based on the possession of expertise and related
professional integrity, and if members of the public are able to
discern who the relevant experts are and trust them appropriately
(Kitcher 2011a, b). Educational institutions play key roles in systems
of public knowledge, and the trust vested in them is foundational to
the enterprise (Laden 2024). Civic polarization, the politicization of
knowledge, and declining trust in universities and other institutions
of public knowledge has rekindled philosophers&rsquo; interest in the
aims of science education: If widespread support for science-based
policy is important to the common good, should the aim of basic
science education for all students be a kind of scientific literacy
that enables them to identify trustworthy scientific experts or
institutions? Would such literacy involve having scientific knowledge,
having historical and philosophical knowledge of how science works (M.
Matthews 2000, 2015), being able to distinguish trustworthy from
untrustworthy sources of scientific claims, or something else? Anjan
Chakravartty has argued that basic science literacy should focus on
the astonishing instrumental success of science as a basis for public
acceptance of science-based policy (Chakravartty 2023). By contrast,
Matt Ferkany points to evidence that knowledge of the basic mechanism
of anthropogenic global warming makes a difference to climate policy
stances across the polarized political spectrum, concluding that it is
too early to abandon the aim of teaching for basic knowledge of
science (Ferkany 2023: 359, 362).</p>

<p>
Somewhat related to this debate about public acceptance of scientific
expertise as a basis of public policy are long-running debates about
the nature of expertise as an aim of education, especially
professional education, and the general problem of how consumers of
expertise can discern the possession of expertise that they themselves
lack. There are cognitive accounts of the nature of expertise that
identify its key aspect as knowledge, intellectual insight, or
understanding of how things within some domain work (Fricker 2006;
Goldman 2018; J. Watson 2021). There are skill-based accounts that
regard expertise as a kind of embodied practical mastery that can be
fluid and intuitive in its operation (Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus 1986).
There are also hybrid accounts that combine knowledge and skill in one
package (Addis &amp; Winch 2019; Winch 2010a, b). The significance of
these accounts for the education and recognition of expertise are
debated, but it has been plausibly suggested that an important sub-aim
of education in professional expertise is to promote ethical
attributes and competence in communication that would enable experts
to establish and retain the trust of non-experts (Quast 2018; Kotzee
2023).</p>

<p>
There have meanwhile been long-running debates about the aims of civic
education, focused on democratic deliberation, civic motivation,
identity, and advancing justice. John Dewey&rsquo;s conception of
democratic education has had enduring influence (Dewey 1916; Riley
&amp; Welchman 2003; Kitcher 2021, 2023), and his concerns about
fascism and respect for norms of public reason (what he called
&ldquo;social intelligence&rdquo;) are as relevant today as when he
wrote them (Dewey 1939). He conceived of democratic societies as
engaging in mutually respectful collective inquiry and
problem-solving, guided by shared respect for scientific methods and
the plurality of concerns of their members (Dewey 1927). He thought it
was in a democracy of this kind that human beings can
&ldquo;grow&rdquo; or flourish, so democratic education would not
simply aim to prepare students for democratic citizenship, it would
accomplish this by initiating them into the kind of civic life through
which they can grow or flourish both as adults and as children.</p>

<p>
The recent era of work on the civic aims of education began with Amy
Gutmann&rsquo;s <em>Democratic Education</em> (1987), William
Galston&rsquo;s <em>Liberal Purposes: Goods, Virtues, and Diversity in
the Liberal State</em> (1991), and John Rawls&rsquo;s <em>Political
Liberalism</em> (1993). It has included notable works by Eamonn Callan
(1997, 2000, 2006), Stephen Macedo (1995, 2003), Rob Reich (2002), and
Victoria Costa (2011), as well as volumes edited by Robert Fullinwider
(1996a), Macedo and Yael Tamir (2002), and Kevin McDonough and Walter
Feinberg (2003). Gutmann argued that democracies have a right to
preserve themselves through education that cultivates virtues of
democratic citizenship&mdash;virtues that bring together moral
character and reasoning, enhancing students&rsquo; individual freedom
while making them willing and able to reason together critically and
respectfully about matters of public concern (Gutmann 1987, 1995,
2002, 2003). Education that enables everyone to participate
&ldquo;effectively&rdquo; in democratic deliberation (1987:
136&ndash;137) is both an investment in the survival of democracy and
a requirement of justice associated with a right to politically
meaningful speech, according to Gutmann.</p>

<p>
Norms of public reason play a similarly important role in
Rawls&rsquo;s <em>Political Liberalism</em> and <em>Justice as
Fairness: A Restatement</em> (2001), which address political
legitimacy, justice, and the norms of political discourse in
multicultural democracies. To be capable of social cooperation,
citizens are regarded as having two &ldquo;moral powers&rdquo;, a
&ldquo;capacity for a sense of justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;the capacity
to have, to revise, and to rationally pursue a conception of the
good&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., a conception of &ldquo;what is of value in
human life&rdquo;, normally grounded in comprehensive
&ldquo;religious, philosophical, or moral doctrines&rdquo; (Rawls
2001: 18&ndash;19). Citizens who subscribe to different comprehensive
conceptions of the good (CCGs) but are willing to accept fair terms of
cooperation would have reasons to endorse constitutional principles of
justice and associated premises of <em>public reason</em> that provide
a &ldquo;shared basis for citizens to justify to one another their
political judgments&rdquo; (2001: 27, 89&ndash;94). &ldquo;Citizens
must be able&hellip; to present to one another publicly acceptable
reasons for their political views in cases raising fundamental
political questions&rdquo; (2001: 91), and they must accept what Rawls
calls the <em>burdens of judgment</em> as conditions on &ldquo;the use
of public reason in directing the legitimate exercise of political
power&rdquo; (Rawls 1993: 54; 2001: 35&ndash;36). Publicly acceptable
reasons pertaining to the factual basis of political judgments come to
rest in scientific methods, evidence, and consensus, to the extent
these are relevant, so the education that prepares citizens to engage
in democratic deliberation must be in part an education in deference
to scientific methods and expertise, so far as public matters are
concerned (cf. Gutmann &amp; Thompson 1996: 15). The burdens of
judgment are factors that give rise to differences of judgment among
reasonable people and acknowledging them when faced with beliefs and
judgments different from one&rsquo;s own is fundamental to respectful
engagement with others in the enterprise of public reason.</p>

<p>
Callan and others have argued that Rawls glosses over the extent to
which this requires civic education that brings diverse children
together, so they can learn to accept the burdens of judgment and
respectfully engage each other in the practice of public reason
(Callan 1997). Rawls&rsquo;s theory of justice would thus imply that
children can be required to participate in civic education, in
settings that nurture respectful dialogue between students of diverse
backgrounds, in the interest of securing the social basis for a
legitimate scheme of democratic cooperation. A foundational aspect of
such a scheme of cooperation is the civic, democratic, or relational
equality entailed by Rawls&rsquo;s underlying conception of free and
equal citizenship. So there are evidently two closely related aims of
education at stake: cultivating the understanding, capabilities, and
virtues foundational to a political order regulated by public reason
and enabling citizens to function as civic equals (Anderson 2007,
2010a, 2010b; Satz 2007; Curren 2023c).</p>

<p>
Visions of deliberative democracy rest on the idea that democracy
mediated by citizens giving each other reasons that reasonable people
could accept is more attractive than democracy mediated by brute
majority power. Critics have argued that compliance with norms of
reason would constrain progress in confronting injustice masked by a
semblance of good faith reasoning. When opponents willfully violate
the cooperative norms of democratic deliberation and do so in pursuit
of ends that could not be publicly justified, reasoning may offer no
remedy. A response to this criticism has been to hold that students
must be prepared for both ideal contexts, in which compliance with
fair terms of cooperation (hence norms of public reason) is universal,
and non-ideal civic contexts, in which such compliance is not
universal (Robertson 2000, 2009a). Students must learn how progress
toward more perfect justice has been achieved in non-ideal
circumstances, how they themselves can contribute to such justice, and
how to enact mutually respectful civic relations whenever possible. In
conditions of racial domination (Blum 1996, 2012, 2024; Thompson 2023;
Wheeler-Bell 2023) and domination of less powerful peoples and states
in international relations (Gutmann 2002), civic and moral education
would thus rightly enlighten students about the conditions in which
they live and how progress is possible, while promoting informed
critical reflection about what is just and ethical.</p>

<p>
Equipping and disposing students to promote justice is thus a further
and distinct civic aim of education that is defended by philosophers
of education (Bialystok 2023). Variations on this theme include
promotion of global justice (Culp 2019; Curren &amp; Dorn 2018;
Kitcher 2021) and sustainability-related intergenerational justice
(Bell 2004; Curren &amp; Metzger 2017; Zwarthoed 2015). While
education for sustainable development has been promoted as conducive
to both global and intergenerational justice, it has also been
criticized as failing to respect liberty rights and other democratic
values (Ferkany &amp; Whyte 2013; Schinkel 2009; Schlottmann 2008).
Another noteworthy focus has been the contributions of universities to
the unjust advantage of the most advantaged and what professors can
legitimately do to educate students in a way that mitigates unjust
advantage (Brighouse 2010; Morton 2021a; Schouten 2022).</p>

<p>
Civic aims of education concern not only students&rsquo; civic
understanding and capabilities (such as to function as civic equals
and participate in processes of public reason) but also attitudes,
dispositions, virtues, and sources of motivation that can sustain
constructive civic engagement. Ideas about such motivation have
focused on patriotism, identity, and civic friendship (or solidarity;
Kitcher 2021, 2023). A common starting point has been the assumption
that ideals of justice and democracy are either too abstract or
&ldquo;thin&rdquo; to motivate civic responsibility, or that enabling
students to develop a rational appreciation of the merits of these
ideals will, for some other reason, rarely succeed in motivating them
to act in defense of those ideals (Galston 1991: 243&ndash;244).
Instilling a motivating commitment to these ideals is then taken to
require something &ldquo;thicker&rdquo;, such as providing
inspirational tales of mythologized national heroes or cultivating a
shared national identity. Discussions of civic motivation as an aim of
education have consequently revolved around the propriety of teaching
patriotism (Archard 1999; Ben-Porath 2006; Blum 2007; Brighouse 2003;
Callan 1997, 2006; Fullinwider 1996b; Gutmann 2002; Hand 2011; R.
Miller 2007; Nussbaum 2012) and to a lesser extent civic friendship
(e.g., Allen 2004) and the &ldquo;thick&rdquo; social (e.g., racial)
identities that citizens bring to their civic roles (Allen &amp; Kidd
2023). Galston and Callan have defended mythologizing education in
non-nationalistic forms of patriotism as facilitating commitment to
norms of justice, while Sigal Ben-Porath has made a similar argument
for the usefulness of patriotic education in enabling societies to
endure the hardships of war. Critics have countered that publicly
sponsored cultivation of sentiments of loyalty and partiality toward
compatriots undermines the legitimacy of governments (Brighouse 1998,
2003; cf. Callan 2000), is inconsistent with equal basic moral respect
for non-compatriots and requirements of global justice (Gutmann 2002;
R. Miller 2007) and ignores a variety of other ways in which actual
patriotism &ldquo;all too often cuts against justice&rdquo; (Brighouse
2003: 163). Habermas&rsquo;s conception of constitutional patriotism,
involving ongoing scrutiny of a country&rsquo;s constitutional
tradition in light of universal norms (Habermas 1992) has inspired
forms of &ldquo;best traditions patriotism&rdquo; (Blum 2007), and
been incorporated into a conception of virtuous patriotism as
ethically appropriate valuing of a country&rsquo;s inhabitants and
what is conducive to them living well together (Curren 2021, Curren
&amp; Dorn 2018). These latter views deny the common assumption that
abstract civic and moral ideals are too &ldquo;thin&rdquo; to be
motivationally potent and in doing so undercut the premise that just
societies require education that aims to cultivate patriotic
sentiments. They may, however, attach motivational significance to
educating diverse children together as equals, so they can form
intergroup friendships that facilitate broader intergroup trust and
cooperation.</p>

<p>
Philosophical justifications of educational aims have obvious
significance for the content, manner, and methods of education, and it
is to these matters that we now turn. Questions of educational
authority and educational responsibilities will follow, and these too
are relevant to curriculum, teaching, educational administration, and
a host of related matters.</p>

<h2 id="ConEdu">3. The Content of Education</h2>

<p>
The content of education has long been understood broadly to include
not only curricula (i.e., series of courses or subjects taught) that
are expressly presented to students as what they will study and learn,
but also what is communicated by aspects of institutional structure
and norms, and by qualities of educational settings, materials, and
practices. Plato wrote that we should be concerned not only that
children learn stories that accurately depict the relationship between
virtue and happiness, but that they &ldquo;live in a healthy
place&rdquo; where buildings, pictures, and other works</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
are like a breeze that brings health from a good place, leading them
unwittingly, from childhood on, to resemblance, friendship, and
harmony with the beauty of reason&mdash;[this is] the best education
for them. (<em>Republic</em> 401b&ndash;d)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In saying this, Plato regarded <em>habituation</em> as a mode of
education and identified true beliefs about what is good and
reasonable as important educational content. Today, such content might
be referred to as &ldquo;hidden curriculum&rdquo; and elective
learning opportunities in addition to courses or subjects taught might
qualify as &ldquo;extracurricular&rdquo;. For present purposes we can
limit &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; to courses or subjects taught and
recognize that there is more to the content of education than
curriculum.</p>

<p>
Philosophers have sometimes formulated, examined, or critiqued guiding
principles for the design of curricula (Plato <em>Laws</em>,
<em>Republic</em>; Locke 1706; Rousseau 1762; Dewey 1902; Scheffler
1958; Lewin 2018) or attempts to construct theories of the curriculum
(Phillips 1998), but in recent years they have usually addressed the
content of education in discussing aims of education, the respective
merits of a common curriculum versus differentiated curricula, moral
and character education, and other controversial topics, subject
matter, or aspects of education.</p>

<h3 id="CurAimAbi">3.1 Curriculum, Aims, and Ability</h3>

<p>
Regarding aims, some of those discussed above imply sweeping, if not
comprehensive, approaches to educational content. If autonomy is an
important aim of education and being autonomous is being able to form
and act on one&rsquo;s own well-informed judgments about how to live
one&rsquo;s life, then the content of education should include an
array of subjects that enable students to understand aspects of the
world that will matter to the kinds of decisions they will need to
make. It should also expose them to diverse values and life goal
orientations, and it should enable them to think critically and make
good decisions. Meaningful encounters with diverse goods, conceptions
of the good, and kinds of lives will be greatly enhanced if they are
not merely curricular but include learning from diverse school peers
and a school ethos that offers alternatives to the profit-seeking
popular culture that dominates students&rsquo; attention (Brighouse
2005).</p>

<p>
If equipping students to live well or flourish is the primary aim of
education, then education for autonomy might be combined with
opportunities to discover and develop competence in interests and
pursuits that can contribute to a flourishing life. The content of
education might in that case be determined less by a broadly autonomy
enhancing grounding in disciplinary knowledge and understanding, and
more by diverse opportunities to engage in activities of learning that
can enable students to experience the inherent rewards of fulfilling
their social, creative, and agentive potential in pursuit of things
they care about (Noddings 1992). Knowledge, understanding, and
intellectual virtue outcomes might be just as robust as what a
disciplines-first approach would yield, but more tailored to
students&rsquo; self-determined paths, while the development of
competence in decision-making or practical wisdom might be
stronger.</p>

<p>
If education in democratic citizenship is prioritized, education for
autonomy might be supplemented with more opportunities to learn what
it is possible to learn from diverse fellow students through debate,
collaborative problem-focused learning, and opportunities to form
civically significant inter-group friendships. In a world of problems
that can only be effectively addressed through global cooperation,
education in democratic citizenship might also engage students in
globally networked collaborative learning that is focused on global
problems (Culp 2019; Curren &amp; Dorn 2018; Kitcher 2021, 2023).</p>

<p>
More specific educational aims could have more and less widely
significant implications for school curricula. Meaningful
sustainability education would require far-reaching changes in
existing curricula, whether the aim is to facilitate a transition to a
sustainable human footprint or simply to enable students to understand
the complexly interacting human, built, and natural systems that shape
everyday decisions and their collective impact. Achieving various aims
of science education (M. Matthews 2000, 2015) or education in the arts
(D&rsquo;Olimpio 2022a, b, 2024; D&rsquo;Olimpio, Pais, &amp; Thompson
2022; Elgin 2009; Greene 2001; Nussbaum 1990, 2010) would involve
significant but narrower ranges of school subjects. By contrast, the
aim of promoting sexual self-determination and health through sex
education would have limited curricular implications.</p>

<p>
Philosophical work on the respective merits of a common curriculum
versus differentiated curricula has been shaped by the aims at stake,
ideas about differences in student ability and interests, and the
importance attached to accommodating parents&rsquo; concerns that
school content be consistent with their worldviews and values. In
defense of democratic education, Dewey objected to tracking secondary
students from privileged backgrounds into a liberal arts curriculum
and others into a vocational curriculum, proposing a kind of hybrid of
these for all students (Dewey 1916). Nussbaum has recently advanced
something similar in her role as an architect of the curriculum of the
Asian University for Women, which aims to educate women leaders for
Asia and the Middle East, by integrating a liberal arts education with
professional training and encouraging students to apply the analytical
tools they acquire to regional problems (Nussbaum 2004). Contemporary
work on ability grouping in secondary schools has meanwhile debated
the ethical, conceptual, and empirical merits of predicating
differentiated curricula on debatable conceptions of ability
(Giesinger 2017; Harel Ben Shahar 2023; Mazie 2009; Merry 2008; K.
Meyer 2014b; Schouten 2012; Thompson 2021).</p>

<h3 id="MorChaEdu">3.2 Moral and Character Education</h3>

<p>
Moral and character education have been the subject of extensive
philosophical and cross-disciplinary research in recent years. The
distinction between <em>moral education</em> and <em>character
education</em> may be clearest in the tension between theories of
moral development inspired by Kant and conceptions of character
formation inspired by Aristotle. The former focus on the principles
that enter into moral judgments, ignoring Kant&rsquo;s theory of
virtue (Munzel 1999, 2012), while the latter focus on virtues,
ignoring the role of universals in Aristotelian practical wisdom. The
resulting polarization is to some extent an artifact of the perceived
legitimacy that virtue-focused education has derived from the virtue
ethics movement&rsquo;s ambition to provide an alternative to
deontological and consequentialist orientations in normative ethical
theory. Taking this at face value, one would expect moral education to
revolve around making decisions on the basis of moral principles and
character education to be focused on the formation of virtue through
habituation and emulation of exemplars (Croce &amp; Vaccarezza 2017;
Kristj&aacute;nsson 2015, 2017; Zagzebski 2013). They do, to some
extent, but the contrast is less simple than it appears.</p>

<p>
One complicating factor is that the Kant-inspired theories of moral
development, propounded by the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg and his
students, concern moral cognition and offer no account of moral
motivation. Attempts to fill this motivational gap have turned to
something like Aristotelian habituation through immersion in a just
school community (Power 1988; Power &amp; Higgins-D&rsquo;Alesandro
2008) and the idea that if people form identity-defining moral
commitments they will be motivated to act in ways that are consistent
with their &ldquo;moral identity&rdquo; or conception of themselves as
having specific moral commitments (Lapsley &amp; Stey 2014). A
school&rsquo;s collective commitment to functioning in accordance with
just principles would be an explicit aspect of the content of
education, and predicating membership in the school community on
sharing that commitment would promote students&rsquo; identification
of those just principles as their own. This would shrink the distance
between moral and character education, especially if character
educators acknowledged that there are unavoidably rule-like elements
in habituation and civic virtue.</p>

<p>
As a theory of moral motivation, the &ldquo;moral identity&rdquo;
construct arguably fails, however. Being motivated to preserve a
morally positive self-understanding can undermine, as well as promote,
moral conduct (Krettenauer 2022), and from a philosophical perspective
it is too ego-involved to constitute genuinely moral motivation. An
alternative view is that genuinely moral motivation involves
responsiveness to both the value of what is at stake and
considerations bearing on what is morally appropriate in the
circumstances (S. Meyer 2016), and that educators can foster such
motivation by modelling appropriate valuing and moral reasoning in
ways that support students&rsquo; basic psychological needs for not
only relatedness, as in early versions of the just school community
model, but also autonomy and competence (Curren &amp; Ryan 2020). A
somewhat related strand of recent philosophy of education concerns the
possibility of valuational progress or individuals coming to hold new
values in a way that is agentive or autonomous (Annas 2011; Callard
2017, 2018).</p>

<p>
A second complicating factor that shrinks the distance between moral
and character education is the role of practical wisdom, and thereby
moral universals, in an Aristotelian conception of virtue. Key
questions are how such wisdom can be fostered, and how reasoning that
is an outgrowth of habituation can be autonomous (Peters 1981; Sherman
1989; Annas 2011; Curren &amp; Park 2024; cf. Copp 2016; Hand 2018, on
moral indoctrination). &ldquo;Intellectualist&rdquo; forms of
neo-Aristotelian character education originating in the work of Nancy
Sherman (1989) have significant implications for the content of
character education because they regard habituation that nurtures the
development of genuine virtue as necessarily supervised in ways that
are cognitively rich and autonomy supportive (Ferkany &amp; Creed
2014).</p>

<p>
Other philosophical orientations in the sphere of moral and character
education include neo-Humean sentimentalist approaches (Noddings 2002;
Slote 2010), and Philosophy for Children and Community of Inquiry
approaches that were first introduced by Matthew Lipman (2003), Gareth
Matthews (1980, 1984, 2009), and Michael Pritchard (1985, 1996).</p>

<p>
Critics of moral character education have made a variety of arguments
bearing on its compatibility with justice-promoting civic education
(Boyd 2011; Suissa 2015; Sanderse 2019). When education in character
virtue is presented as instrumentally helpful to addressing such
problems as inequality, lack of social mobility, and unemployment
(Paterson et al. 2014), critics have insisted that moral character
education is at best a distraction from, and at worst incompatible
with, civic education that prepares young people to fight for
justice-enhancing structural reform. Inculcation of specific virtues,
such as civility, has also been seen as delegitimizing appropriate
responses to injustice, and to that extent incompatible with education
for vigorous pursuit of justice (Ward 2017). A response to this is
that genuinely virtuous moral, intellectual, and civic attributes
would necessarily be aspects of a harmoniously integrated state of
character. Alleged moral or civic virtues that cannot be fully
integrated would not qualify as genuine virtues. So, civility would
qualify as a virtue only if it is understood in such a way as to be
compatible with appropriately vigorous (i.e., virtuous) response to
injustice (Peterson 2019: 25&ndash;32).</p>

<h3 id="ConSub">3.3 Controversial Subjects</h3>

<p>
Philosophical work on controversial subject matter in education
includes multicultural education (W. Feinberg 1998; Fullinwider 1996a;
Levinson 2009; Reich 2002; Tamir 1995, 2003), race (Blum 1996, 2012,
2024; Mills 2007; Thompson 2018, 2023; Wheeler-Bell 2019a, b, 2023),
sex (Archard 1998, 2000, 2003; Bialystok &amp; Andersen 2022; Hand
2007; C. Mayo 2021; McAvoy 2013), religion (Clayton 2006, 2012, 2015;
Clayton et al. 2021; Hand 2003, 2014; Justice &amp; Macleod 2016;
Macleod 2003; Swift 2020; Tillson 2019), evolutionary science (Laats
&amp; Siegel 2016; Midgley 2007; Pennock 2002), and climate and
sustainability (Curren &amp; Metzger 2017: 153&ndash;179; Ferkany
2015, 2023; Ferkany &amp; Whyte 2013; Schinkel 2009; Schlottmann 2008,
2012; Zwarthoed 2015). What is and is not properly regarded as
controversial in a way that makes teaching it
&ldquo;directively&rdquo; or as something true is itself a matter of
philosophical controversy (Drerup 2023; Hand 2008, 2014; Hess &amp;
McAvoy 2015; Tillson 2017; Zimmerman &amp; Robertson 2017).</p>

<p>
There are a variety of reasons for thinking that only well-established
truths should be taught <em>directively</em> or as true. Assumptions
and commitments that are foundational to rational inquiry, a
constitutional rule of law, and rights-respecting democracy should
similarly be presented as such. Educators should thus exhibit
intellectual honesty and diligence in teaching students what they need
to know and should take care not to mislead them, yet it is also
widely thought that education in rational (e.g., scientific) inquiry
and for democratic citizenship are facilitated by engaging students in
collective inquiry, debate, and deliberation that would sometimes
address controversial matters. What should count as controversial for
this purpose is itself controversial, and the debate has featured a
number of proposed criteria (Drerup 2023; Hand 2008, 2014; Hess &amp;
McAvoy 2015; Tillson 2017; Zimmerman &amp; Robertson 2017). From the
standpoint of civic education, one might favor a criterion of
<em>political authenticity</em> that allows students to debate
controversies that have currency in political decision-making (Hess
&amp; McAvoy 2015). However, one would then need to decide whether
empirical questions (e.g., about the causes and hazards of climate
change) that are controversial in this political sense should be
presented as controversial in schools, or whether an <em>epistemic
criterion</em> that treats empirical claims as non-controversial if
they are well-established within the most authoritative epistemic
communities should be determinative (Hand 2007, 2008, 2014; Tillson
2017; Zimmerman &amp; Robertson 2017). Consensus among climatologists
would permit directive teaching of well-established climate science
under an epistemic criterion, and the individual and collective
interests of students and humanity would evidently require it. One
could also object that there are things that should be debated that
are not debated, and others that are debated but should not be debated
because they are matters of fundamental rights. A recent example of
the latter (in the U.S.) is same-sex marriage, and a specific concern
regarding treating it as controversial in classrooms is the likelihood
of dignitary harm to students with same-sex parents (Drerup 2023; J.
Mayo 2016). In determining what can be taught directively and should
not be presented as controversial, recognizing roles for both
epistemic closure within relevant communities of experts and
fundamental principles of justice would align with education in
Rawlsian norms of public reason (see Drerup 2023).</p>

<p>
Should the existence of racial injustice be taught as fact and as an
aspect of promoting free and equal citizenship? Should it be debated
as an open question or ignored because there is no public consensus
that it should be addressed in schools? Anti-racist education
qualifies as controversial (in the U.S.) under the <em>political
authenticity</em> test, but it is typically regarded in philosophy of
education as an important aspect of moral education (Blum 1996, 2012,
2024; Thompson 2018, 2023; Wheeler-Bell 2019a, b, 2023). It would
challenge negative interpersonal values (e.g., racial stereotyping and
antipathy), promote positive interpersonal values (e.g., positive
interracial respect and appreciation), challenge negative systemic
values (e.g., systemic racial injustice in the criminal justice
system), and promote positive systematic values (e.g., interracial
civic friendship and the achievement of free and equal citizenship)
(Blum 2024). In Quentin Wheeler-Bell&rsquo;s words, it would</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
provide students with the sociological and moral understanding
essential to autonomously navigating unjust institutions and working
collectively to advance democratic equality and human flourishing.
(Wheeler-Bell 2023: 280)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Anti-racist education with these components would not be unacceptably
controversial under a criterion for acceptable directive teaching
consistent with Rawlsian norms of public reason, provided it is
empirically well-grounded, affirms free and equal citizenship and
related principles of justice, and fosters civic friendship, trust,
and cooperation. Predicating education for racial justice on a
specific controversial theory of the nature of race might put the
legitimacy of the enterprise in doubt, but philosophical work on
racial identity and anti-racist education has been more circumspect
than popular discourse in this regard (see esp., Thompson 2018,
2023).</p>

<p>
Education concerning anthropogenic climate change and other aspects of
sustainability also qualifies as controversial (in the U.S.) under the
<em>political authenticity</em> test, despite the overwhelming
consensus of climatologists and sustainability science that human
activities are destabilizing Earth&rsquo;s climate and life-sustaining
systems in ways that will be increasingly catastrophic. Education
concerning these matters has seemed important enough to warrant a
UNESCO Decade of Education for Sustainable Development
(2005&ndash;2014), but there are disagreements about its content. A
philosophically significant concern is whether the ethical content of
climate and sustainability education is compatible with an appropriate
standard of liberal neutrality (Ferkany &amp; Whyte 2013; Schinkel
2009; Schlottmann 2008, 2012; Zwarthoed 2015). Sustainability has been
perceived by many environmental ethicists as requiring a
transformative moral perspective on the value of nature, and the
educational promotion of such a perspective would evidently be
inconsistent with liberal neutrality. An alternative view is that no
such moral transformation is required; the ethical dimensions of
climate and sustainability are applications of familiar principles of
common morality. Climate and sustainability education are defended as
foundational to legitimate global cooperation in addressing the
problems and to fulfilling children&rsquo;s right to know what is
essential to living prudently and responsibly in the world they will
face. These rationales suggest a need for integrated curricula that
promote understanding of the ways planetary, economic, and social
systems interact, critical thinking about well-being and life goal
orientations, and education in collaborative problem solving and
global citizenship (Curren &amp; Metzger 2017: 153&ndash;179; Kitcher
2021, 2023).</p>

<h2 id="ManMet">4. Manner and Methods</h2>

<p>
The manner and methods of education and para-educational practices can
be understood to include methods of instruction, structuring of
learning environments, disciplinary practices, student evaluation,
administrative practices, models of structural reform, and the
justification of educational policies and practices. While
historically important philosophical debates about pedagogy have waned
in recent years, there has been greater interest in free speech,
indoctrination, and disciplinary practices. Education ethicists have
also focused on the complexity of teachers&rsquo; classroom
decision-making and ethics of administrative practices. Policy-focused
philosophers of education have addressed not only specific matters of
education policy, such as high-stakes testing and school choice
schemes, but the roles of values and evidence in justifying education
policies and practices.</p>

<h3 id="InsDisPra">4.1 Instructional and Disciplinary Practices</h3>

<p>
Philosophical debates about instructional practices have revolved
around competing views of inquiry, understanding, and learning. A
fundamental debate concerning methods of inquiry is whether
students&rsquo; mastery of these methods is essential to fulfilling
the epistemic aims of education. Epistemic agency evidently requires
some command of methods of inquiry, and philosophical interest in the
role of these methods in education is at least as old as Plato&rsquo;s
attention to the limitations of Socrates&rsquo; method of questioning
(<em>elenchus</em>) in his dialogue <em>Meno.</em> The elenchus is a
method of refutation through which inconsistencies are exposed, and
the dialogue also depicts a very different form of &ldquo;Socratic
method&rdquo; through which a boy is led to deduce a theorem of
geometry. Aristotle structured the sciences that he subsequently
founded as axiomatic systems modelled on geometry, and acquiring
knowledge of such a science would require a student to reason their
way up from the foundational axioms and definitions through chains of
theorems and back. Experiencing instances of the natural kinds that
are the objects of the science would also be essential to grasping
what it is about, and Aristotle&rsquo;s works on biology and politics
provide models of direct instruction on scientific methods (esp.,
schemes of classification) and findings (e.g., generalizations about
the causes of stability and instability of different kinds of
constitutions). The need for such direct instruction was put in
question by Descartes&rsquo; identification of <em>natural reason</em>
as the very form of reasoning essential to science, and
Rousseau&rsquo;s vision of learning through inquiry in
<em>&Eacute;mile</em> was predicated on this very assumption of
identity between natural and scientific reason. Rousseau envisioned
the eponymous boy &Eacute;mile rediscovering astronomy and physics
through his own observations, as if the methods of sciences were not
inventions and precise measurement, mathematical models, and invented
concepts played no role (M. Matthews 2000, 2015). Initiation into the
established conceptual schemes, methods, and ideals of sciences and
other disciplines remains today a different conception of how to
promote active learning from <em>constructivist</em> pedagogies that
take the relevant forms and norms of individual and collective
thinking to be natural or intuitive (Elgin 2011; Grandy 1998; Phillips
1995; M. Matthews 1998, 2015). If one grants that learning to think
critically about questions addressed by forms of disciplinary
knowledge is enhanced by mastering the concepts, modes of inquiry and
analysis, and standards of evidence and rigor that have been developed
by these disciplines, then one may conclude that these elements of
disciplines should be explained and modeled by teachers and mastered
by students through supervised practice.</p>

<p>
Critical thinking and intellectual virtues pedagogues have similarly
assumed that there are teachable attributes of critical thinkers or
intellectual virtues that transcend the various disciplines and are
widely applicable. Competing models of critical thinking pedagogy have
focused on methods of argument evaluation, dimensions and standards of
thinking, and classroom communities of inquiry. Turning to
intellectual character education, Heather Battaly has helpfully
identified the elements of a standard approach as well as some
limitations. The standard elements are</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(1) formal instruction about the intellectual virtues; (2) exposure to
exemplars of virtue; (3) practice in <em>identifying</em> actions that
exemplars would perform and in <em>identifying</em> motivation and
emotions that exemplars would have; (4) practice in
<em>performing</em> actions that exemplars would perform and in
<em>having</em> motivations and emotions they would have; (5) practice
in recognizing situations in which the virtue in question is relevant;
and (6) reflection on one&rsquo;s development. (Battaly 2023: 138)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Battaly argues that this standard approach must be supplemented with
ameliorative strategies to address the intellectual vices that many
students may have, and that if tendencies to intellectual vices are
widespread then ameliorative strategies won&rsquo;t be enough.
Addressing systemic causes of intellectual vices, including common
features of schools (Kidd 2019), would also be essential.</p>

<p>
Recognition of the obstacles to nurturing intellectual and civic
virtues in an age of polarization has inspired related efforts to
constructively address perceived threats to free speech and safety in
speaking on college and university campuses (Ben-Porath 2017, 2023,
2024; Cudd 2019) and the role of trust in epistemic networks and the
work of universities (Laden 2023, 2024). The significance of student
speech and freedom from indoctrination have been concerns in the
context of schools as well (Ben-Porath &amp; Webster 2023; Callan
2011, 2016; Callan &amp; Arena 2009; Warnick 2009, 2013), especially
in connection with the value of debate and deliberation for civic
learning (as discussed above).</p>

<p>
Teachers&rsquo; minute-by-minute orchestration of students&rsquo;
learning involves much more than teaching, of course. It may often be
focused as much on students&rsquo; behavior as on academic learning,
and their responses to students&rsquo; failures to meet behavioral
expectations can take many forms, from educational and problem-solving
interventions to restorative practices and various forms of
punishment. While specific forms and aspects of surveillance (Warnick
2007), behavioral regimes (Ben-Porath 2013; Lamboy &amp; Lu 2017), and
punishment (e.g., corporal punishment and racial disparities) in
schools have received some ethical scrutiny, it is only very recently
that fundamental questions about the justification of punishment in
schools have received sustained attention: On what grounds, with what
procedural safeguards, and for what kinds of failures might specific
forms of punishment of minor children in the custody of schools be
dispensed, consistent with the formative purposes of schools and the
limitations of decisional competence on which the need for custody is
predicated (Lamboy, Taylor &amp; Thompson 2020; Thompson &amp; Tillson
2020, 2023)? Is a problem-solving approach that enlists students in
understanding why they fail to meet expectations ethically preferable
to punishment, on the grounds that it promotes self-regulation? Are
restorative practices that qualify as punishment essential to
upholding the norms of a just school community when offenses cause
significant harm (Scribner &amp; Warnick 2021)?</p>

<h3 id="AdmPraPolFor">4.2 Administrative Practices and Policy Formation</h3>

<p>
Philosophical work on administrative and policy dimensions of
education has been dominated by debates surrounding structural changes
and reform movements in education, while also touching on an evolving
variety of more specific practices. The former include school choice
schemes (Ben-Porath &amp; Johanek 2019; Blum 2023; Brighouse 2000;
Schmidtz &amp; Brighouse 2020; Crouch 2003; W. Feinberg &amp;
Lubienski 2008), the standards and accountability movement (Dwyer
2004; Tamir 2023), a small schools movement (Strike 2004), the rise of
home schooling in the U.S. and other jurisdictions (Dwyer &amp; Peters
2019; Kunzman 2009; Reich 2002), and the emergence of
college-in-prison programs (Fantuzzo 2022). Work on the ethics of
specific administrative practices and policies has addressed such
topics as university admissions policies (Fullinwider &amp;
Lichtenberg 2004; Kotzee &amp; Martin 2013; Levinson 2022; Warnick
2022), seniority-based rules for teacher lay-offs (Levinson &amp;
Theisen-Homer 2015), and the role of school authorities in the
deportation of student families (Geron &amp; Levinson 2018).</p>

<p>
In addition to work on such substantive issues of educational practice
and policy, philosophers have devoted significant attention to related
methodological issues: How are the respective roles of values and
evidence in justifying educational policies and practices best
understood? Why should the model of &ldquo;evidence-based&rdquo;
education policy be replaced with the model of &ldquo;values-led and
evidence-informed&rdquo; policy (Brighouse, Ladd, et al. 2018;
Schouten &amp; Brighouse 2015)? Why is the promotion of randomized
controlled trials as the gold standard for the empirical basis of
education policy and practice misguided (Biesta 2007, 2010; Cartwright
&amp; Hardie 2012; Joyce &amp; Cartwright 2018, 2020, 2023; Kvernbekk
2016)?</p>

<h2 id="AutEdu">5. Authority to Educate</h2>

<p>
Philosophical debates about educational authority have been largely in
response to evolving challenges to the authority of states to regulate
education. They have also been shaped by a variety of philosophical
positions on the normative considerations that should determine
assignments of authority over various aspects of education. The
challenges to public educational authority include efforts to obtain
exemptions from the normally required number of years of schooling (J.
Feinberg 1980), the exemption of religious institutions from legal
barriers to discrimination on the basis of sex (Dwyer 1998; Galston
2003), homeschool movements that have fought regulation of education
provided in homes and requirements for children to be educated in
schools (Dwyer &amp; Peters 2019), parents&rsquo; and
legislator&rsquo;s efforts to prevent subjects from being taught in
public schools (Bialystok &amp; Andersen 2022; Laats &amp; Siegel
2016; Pennock 2002), and parents&rsquo; assertions of a presumed right
to selectively opt their children out of required educational content
(Archard 2000; Bialystok 2018). The normative considerations adduced
in debating these challenges include the respective rights and
interests of parents, children, and the public (Archard &amp; Macleod
2002; Brighouse &amp; Swift 2006b, 2014; Dwyer 1998, 2003; Dwyer &amp;
Peters 2019; J. Feinberg 1980; Galston 2003; Gutmann 1987, 2003;
Levinson 1999; Macleod 1997; Reich 2009), the consequences of
distributing educational authority in different ways (Brighouse &amp;
Swift 2023), the right or responsibility of a constitutional democracy
to provide for the educational basis of its continuity across
generations (Gutmann 1987; Rawls 1971, 1993, 2001), applications of
principles of liberal justice to families (Clayton 2006), and
different conceptions of the parent-child relationship (Brighouse
&amp; Swift 2014).</p>

<p>
Strands of Ancient Greek and Enlightenment Liberal thought play
significant roles in recent debates concerning educational authority.
Plato and Aristotle proposed public monopolies on the provision of
schooling that would be compulsory for all citizen children. There was
no semblance of public education in their world apart from compulsory
enrollment in military training and service in Sparta and Crete, a
context that is most evident in Plato&rsquo;s <em>Laws</em>, where the
point of having a system of public day schools is essentially to train
and enlist citizens in individual and collective self-governance in
accordance with reason&mdash;to &ldquo;rule and be ruled as justice
demands&rdquo; (Plato <em>Laws</em> 643e&ndash;644a). Plato took a
step toward this in the opening lines of the <em>Republic</em>, where
he implicitly repudiates Socrates&rsquo; apparent view that education
could safely remain in the hands of families if philosophers provided
higher education in ethical inquiry. The implication is that only a
society that invests in early education that strengthens the rational
element in human nature can achieve the form of civic life mediated by
reasoning together that Socrates envisioned (Curren 2000). Plato seems
to predicate public educational authority on the desirability of this
form of life.</p>

<p>
Turning to Enlightenment Liberal thought, Locke argued that parents
have a fundamental duty to provide their children the care and
education they need to become rational beings who can govern and
provide for themselves. He held that parents&rsquo; educational
authority derives from their educational duties and is thus limited
and contingent on ongoing fulfillment of those duties (Locke 1690:
&sect; 69). John Stuart Mill went farther than Locke in repudiating
parents&rsquo; claims to &ldquo;absolute and exclusive control&rdquo;
over their children&rsquo;s education, insisting it is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
almost a self-evident axiom that the State should require and compel
the education, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is
born its citizen. (Mill 1859 [1978: 104])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What has been recently quoted far more often, however, is Mill&rsquo;s
assertion in the next paragraph of <em>On Liberty</em> that &ldquo;A
general State education is a mere contrivance for molding people to be
exactly like one another&rdquo; (1859 [1978: 104&ndash;105]).
Contemporary challenges to public educational authority quote this,
and defenders of it respond by arguing that individuality and
diversity are compatible with public provision of education and a
division of educational authority.</p>

<p>
Responding directly to Mill, Gutmann argued that dividing educational
authority between parents, citizens, and professional educators is
essential to fulfilling a democratic state&rsquo;s commitment</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
to provide its members with an education adequate to participating in
democratic politics, to choosing among (a limited range of) good
lives, and to sharing in the several subcommunities, such as families,
that impart identity to the lives of its citizens. (Gutmann 1987:
42)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Defending teachers&rsquo; professional authority as essential to their
role in cultivating students&rsquo; capacity for critical deliberation
(1987: 82), she established a point of reference for ensuing
discussions of teachers&rsquo; authority and bureaucratic,
legislative, and parental encroachment on their exercise of
professional judgment (see Levinson 2023a, Levinson &amp; Fay 2016,
2019, on the inescapable role of teachers&rsquo; judgment in good
teaching). An alternative three-way division of educational authority
was suggested by Rob Reich, who argued that, in addition to parents
and states, children themselves should have a share of authority over
their own education that is commensurate with their progress toward
autonomy or prudence in making decisions about their own lives (Reich
2009). Children have a strong interest in their own education, just as
parents and states both have legitimate interests in children&rsquo;s
education, and their respective interests might be well-served by
recognizing each as having some authority. The line of argument here
is typical of recent debates in combining consequentialist
considerations with arguments from justice and rights, in this case an
adolescent&rsquo;s emerging right of self-determination and the
absence of any countervailing parental right to determine the life
course of a child.</p>

<p>
Proponents of unregulated homeschooling typically hold that
parents&rsquo; custodial authority entails an exclusive and unlimited
right to control their children&rsquo;s education (Dwyer &amp; Peters
2019). Reich, Brighouse, Clayton, Dwyer, Levinson, and others deny
that parents have any such right, while developing somewhat differing
views of the basis and limits of parental and state educational
authority. While most regard parents as free to educate children into
their own comprehensive conceptions of the good (CCGs) but obligated
to accept the legitimacy of state authority to secure children&rsquo;s
developmental interest in autonomy, an alternative view is that
families are no different from public institutions in being barred
from such &ldquo;comprehensive enrollment&rdquo; in CCGs by respect
for free and equal citizenship (Clayton 2006, 2012, 2015). Recent
defenses of public educational authority sometimes follow Gutmann in
predicating it on a right or responsibility of constitutional
democracies to provide for their own futures through civic education,
but they often ground it in a collective responsibility to promote the
autonomy foundational to legitimate governance and citizens&rsquo;
pursuit of lives that are good for them. These philosophical defenses
of state educational authority are <em>pluralistic</em>, in the sense
that they favor limited and divided educational authority. They side
with Mill in rejecting assertions of parents&rsquo; &ldquo;absolute
and exclusive&rdquo; authority over the education of their own
children, and they also reject any comparable assertion by states of
&ldquo;absolute and exclusive&rdquo; or <em>monopolistic</em>
authority over the education of children within their jurisdiction.
Such authority would license an unlimited state role in the provision
of education and unlimited regulatory authority over any education the
state does not choose to provide.</p>

<p>
While <em>nihilist</em> (i.e., anarchist or radically libertarian)
stances toward state educational authority are comparatively rare
(Suissa 2006), philosophical defenses of <em>monopolist</em> stances
seem to be nonexistent. Contemporary assessments of Ancient Greek
arguments for a state monopoly on education and Mill&rsquo;s
objections to a state monopoly (Curren 2000; Gutmann 1987) have led to
much the same <em>pluralist</em> conclusions as contemporary liberal
assessments of debates over school choice (Brighouse 2000). Adequate
public provision of education and oversight of private schools and
homeschooling have been defended as requirements of justice, but the
defenses invariably assume that families and other private
institutions will play largely unregulated roles in the education and
development of children. Advocates of school choice schemes have
sometimes presented them as alternatives to a state monopoly on
schooling (Friedman 1962), but defenses of school choice have been
largely predicated on predictions of their effects, and philosophical
critiques of school choice have been similarly sensitive to evidence
and projections of effects (Ben-Porath &amp; Johanek 2019; Blum 2023;
Crouch 2003; W. Feinberg &amp; Lubienski 2008; Swift 2003). Some
willingness to assign educational authority to a mix of private and
public entities on the basis of the likely consequences of such
assignments can thus be imputed to both sides of the school choice
debate, even as innovations in school governance, such as charter
schools (Blum 2023) have blurred the public-private distinction on
which much of the debate over educational authority has been
predicated.</p>

<h2 id="EduRes">6. Educational Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
It bears repeating that responsibility to provide education and
authority over aspects of its provision may be closely related and
bound up with specific aims of education. Governments, parents,
educators, and students may all have educational responsibilities,
just as they may all have some related educational authority. The
nature, grounds, and extent of these responsibilities are disputed,
giving rise to debates about who has what educational
responsibilities. What grounds the educational responsibilities of
governments, families, educators, and (possibly) students? How are
these various responsibilities related to one another and to
distributions of educational authority? Which of these
responsibilities are ethical and which are (also) responsibilities of
justice? Which are responsibilities of adequate provision, which are
responsibilities of equal provision, and which are responsibilities to
address forms of disadvantage? How should equality of provision of
education&mdash;or equality of opportunity <em>through</em>
education&mdash;be understood? What forms of justice (e.g.,
distributive, relational, or corrective) and forms of individual
difference and group-based identity are involved, and how do they
intersect? To what extent can these questions of justice be addressed
through applications of theories of political justice? What might a
comprehensive theory of educational justice entail?</p>

<h3 id="NatGroDis">6.1 Nature, Grounds, and Distribution</h3>

<p>
Parents, guardians, and educators with custodial authority over minor
children are all widely regarded as having weighty ethical obligations
or responsibilities to safeguard and promote the developmental and
educational interests of the children in their care. These
responsibilities may be seen as arising largely through voluntary
acceptance of the relevant roles, but there are disputes regarding the
ethical significance of procreation and whether the educational
responsibilities and authority of educators of minor children derive
from those of parents, derive from those of governments, or may be to
some extent independently grounded (Ahlberg &amp; Cholbi 2017).
Parents might suppose that teachers in their children&rsquo;s schools
are simply agents to whom they conditionally delegate some of their
own educational authority and responsibility, while the best ethical
analysis might be that teachers have independent professional
responsibilities to every student in their care, as well as ethically
significant responsibilities they incur as government employees. These
professional and state-actor responsibilities might include ones
pertaining to civic education, such as cultivating virtues of
democratic citizenship and promoting civic equality, and ones entailed
by the educational provisions of international human rights
conventions to which nearly all countries are signatories (i.e.,
equitably promoting the individual flourishing of every student;
United Nations 1948, Art. 26; 1989, Art. 29). Whether or not
governments in the jurisdictions in question have constitutional and
legal systems that align with liberal-democratic principles of justice
or with established human rights provisions, one might see such
principles or rights as grounding educational responsibilities that
states and state-actors should see themselves as having, even if their
non-ideal circumstances preclude easy enactment of those
responsibilities. This is more-or-less the assumption on which
&ldquo;non-ideal theory&rdquo; or justice-focused ethical analysis of
real-world educational decision-making rests: ideal theorizing about
(political) justice has not reached consensus on a way to organize
principles of justice into a defensible structure, but we can agree on
the relevance of many such principles to deciding how to fulfill
educational responsibilities in the non-deal world in which such
decisions are made (see e.g., Levinson &amp; Theisen-Homer 2015;
Levinson, Geron, &amp; Brighouse 2022).</p>

<p>
Do students have responsibilities to contribute to the success of
their own educations? The language of equal educational opportunity
suggests that education is something offered to rational actors, who
are at liberty to take advantage of it or not; and from a pedagogical
standpoint it is important that students have some choice in the
learning tasks they undertake. Their educational progress will
undoubtedly depend on the quantity and quality of their efforts to
learn, and it is important that they learn to take responsibility for
the decisions they make. These considerations suggest that students
should be regarded as having some responsibility to cooperate in their
education. However, it is arguably inappropriate to think of students
who are minor children as fully-formed rational agents who are offered
opportunities (Schouten 2023: 189). Motivation and skill in converting
educational offerings into desirable attributes are themselves largely
products of education, and one does not need to be committed to a luck
egalitarian perspective to think it is wrong to expect children to
bear the potentially life-long consequences of making bad educational
choices that could be prevented by adults setting safe boundaries and
providing motivationally sound learning environments. It is thus only
in a qualified, low-stakes sense that minor children should be
regarded as having responsibility for the success of their own
education.</p>

<h3 id="AdeEquDis">6.2 Adequacy, Equality, and Disadvantage</h3>

<p>
How should the fulfillment of educational responsibilities be
measured? The philosophical literature that engages this question has
been overwhelmingly shaped by theories of political justice and the
role of educators as state actors who are answerable to principles of
justice. The theoretical debates have thus revolved around educational
justice (Culp 2023), equality (Brighouse 1995; Brighouse &amp; Swift
2009a; Harel Ben Shahar 2016), equal opportunity (Jencks 1988;
Anderson 2012; Lewis 2012; Jacobs 2016; Schouten 2023), or equity
(Levinson, Geron, &amp; Brighouse 2022; Levinson, Geron, O&rsquo;Brien
&amp; Reid 2024). There are aims, aspects, and conditions of education
for which <em>adequacy, equality</em>, and the <em>prioritizing</em>
of efforts to enable students to overcome <em>disadvantages</em> are
relevant dimensions of fulfilling educational responsibilities.
Debates over the relative merits of <em>sufficientarian</em>,
<em>egalitarian</em>, and <em>prioritarian</em> principles of justice
in political philosophy (Rawls 1971, 2001; Anderson 1999, 2007, 2010a;
Arneson 2000; Macleod 2012) have consequently informed debates about
educational justice, equality, equal opportunity, equity (Gutmann
1987; Brighouse &amp; Swift 2006a, 2009a; Walker &amp; Unterhalter
2007; Anderson 2007, 2010b; Reich 2013; Schouten 2012, 2023; Shields
2015; Voigt 2017), or responsibility. Debates concerning the merits of
<em>distributive</em> and <em>relational</em> conceptions of equality
(Anderson 1999, 2007, 2010a; Satz 2007; Brighouse &amp; Swift 2009a)
and alternative <em>metrics</em> of justice&mdash;primary goods,
capabilities, welfare (Brighouse 2001; Walker &amp; Unterhalter 2007;
Macleod 2010; Nussbaum 2011)&mdash;have also played roles.</p>

<p>
There are clearly respects in which the <em>adequacy</em> of education
matters. Education should be adequate with respect to enabling
graduates to be well employed and function as civic equals (Anderson
2007, 2010b). It should also be adequate with respect to the ongoing
quality of students&rsquo; lives at school, both because this matters
ethically from a <em>non-preparatory</em> perspective (Brennan 2014;
Gheaus 2015; Bagattini &amp; Macleod 2015; Macleod 2018; Hart &amp;
Brando 2018) and because need-supportive educational environments are
more conducive to learning (Curren, Boniwell, et al. 2024).
<em>Prioritizing</em> the educational interests of those disadvantaged
by poverty, racism, differences of ability (Ahlberg 2014; Brighouse
2001; Robeyns 2006; Terzi 2008; Warnock 2005), language, or other
factors will similarly seem most important when such disadvantages
threaten to deny children the adequate or comparable education they
might otherwise obtain and when entire sectors of a population might
otherwise remain a dominated class unable to function as free and
equal citizens (Blum 2002; Anderson 2010b; Blum &amp; Burkholder 2021;
Wheeler-Bell 2023).</p>

<p>
Conceptions of <em>educational equality</em> (EE) or <em>equal
educational opportunity</em> (EEO) divide along several dimensions, so
there are many forms that EE or EEO might take. The various dimensions
can be framed as questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
<strong>Is it equal opportunity <em>for</em> education or equal
opportunity <em>through</em> education that matters?</strong> If EE or
EO <em>for</em> E is at issue, the concern might be equality with
respect to the quality of educational experiences&mdash;e.g., of
experiencing a growth of competence and deepening of interest in
things that make for a meaningful life&mdash;or development of
understanding, judgment, and virtues that contribute to prudent
self-determination and civic cooperation. Educational goods of these
kinds are not inherently competitive or <em>positional</em>, though
there are contexts in which they may confer positional advantage. By
contrast, the idea of EO <em>through</em> E is associated with the
inherently positional, high-stakes role that educational
qualifications have come to play as work and labor markets have been
transformed by the growth of educational systems across the globe.
Building on the idea that access to desirable positions and offices
should be based strictly on <em>bona fide</em> job qualifications,
Rawls introduced the idea of <em>fair equality of opportunity</em>
(FEO), which would require</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
not merely that public offices and social positions be open [to all,
in accordance with talent] in the formal sense, but that all should
have a fair chance to attain them&hellip;. Those who have the same
level of [natural] talent and ability and the same willingness to use
these gifts should have the same prospects of success regardless of
their social class origin, the class into which they are born and
develop until the age of reason. (Rawls 2001: 73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rawls argued that FEO would require, among other things, &ldquo;equal
opportunities of education for all regardless of family income&rdquo;
(2001: 44). Some have argued that FEO is an ethically defective
measure of educational justice because it is impossible to achieve
without intruding too far into family life and suppressing natural and
desirable differences between children (Gutmann 1987: 131&ndash;133).
Others have defended EE as a good that should be pursued within the
limits implied by what is right in such objections (Brighouse 1995;
Barry 2005; Levinson, Geron, &amp; Brighouse 2022). The question of
how to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate intrusions into
family life has been addressed primarily by defining ethical limits to
legitimate parental <em>partiality</em> (i.e., parents&rsquo; favoring
of their own children in ways that confer competitive advantage)
(Macleod 2002; Brighouse &amp; Swift 2009b, 2014).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>Does justice require that governments ensure all children
receive equally good schooling or that all children receive equally
good education in all of its many aspects, both in and outside of
school?</strong> The former would constitute a form of <em>marginal
equality</em>, while the latter would constitute a form of <em>global
equality</em> (Rae 1981). FEO would require that all children have
equal chances to acquire the <em>bona fide</em> job qualifications
required for the most coveted employment, hence a form of global
educational equality. Brian Barry (2005), Gina Schouten (2023) and
others have noted that achieving such global EE would require policies
to sharply reduce inequality of family resources.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>What is the relevant <em>scope of comparison</em> in
determining whether EE or EEO has been achieved? The students within a
school? A school district? Municipality? State? Country? The
world?</strong> Rawlsian FEO would require education that is equal for
the students of an entire country. Whether FEO could be meaningfully
applied globally is debatable (D. Miller 2007: 62&ndash;68), but in a
densely interdependent world of large-scale migration and global
mobility in higher education and labor markets, there are increasingly
urgent questions of global educational justice that philosophers are
only beginning to address (Culp 2019, 2023; Culp &amp; Zwarthoed 2020;
Geron &amp; Levinson 2018; Stojanov 2018b; Brando 2023; Zwarthoed
2023).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>What is the relevant <em>measure</em> of equality? Is it
<em>inputs</em>, such as per student funding, teacher qualifications,
class size, extent of college preparatory curriculum, or quality of
school facilities? Is it <em>outcomes</em>, such as graduation or
college acceptance, employment outcomes, or life-time flourishing?
</strong> Students will not all benefit equally from the same inputs
or from outputs that are <em>primary goods</em>&mdash;all-purpose
means to living a good life&mdash;so it is important to distinguish
<em>lot-regarding</em> equality (i.e., students getting the same
things) with respect to things that may not benefit everyone equally
with <em>person-regarding</em> equality of benefit (Rae 1981).
Ethically significant person-regarding measures of EE would include
student experiences such as experiences of equal respect, a relevant
variety of learning experiences, and childhood pleasures (Levinson,
Geron, &amp; Brighouse 2022).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<strong>Is EE with respect to <em>individual</em> students most
ethically relevant or equality with respect to specific
<em>categories</em> (or <em>blocks</em>; Rae 1981) of students, who
may be disadvantaged by reason of race, sex, language, culture,
ability, or social class? </strong> Concerns arise regarding both. FEO
is a form of block-regarding EE in which children are grouped by
social class of origin and by &ldquo;level of [natural] talent and
ability and the same willingness to use these gifts&rdquo; (Rawls
2001: 73). It has been criticized for its singular focus on equalizing
life-prospects across social classes while tolerating the prospect of
a self-perpetuating aristocracy of the talented and motivated (D.
Miller 1996; Clayton 2001; Satz 2007; Schouten 2012). If the
underlying ethical consideration is that children&rsquo;s
life-prospects should not be hostage to morally arbitrary luck, then
why would justice require efforts to compensate children for bad luck
in the socio-economic class into which they are born, and not efforts
to compensate them for bad luck in their natural endowments (Jencks
1988; Harel Ben Shahar 2016; Levinson, Geron, &amp; Brighouse 2022;
Schouten 2023)? Block-regarding educational strategies designed to
overcome systems of racial, gender, and caste domination have been
extensively debated, and ones that are designed to prevent the
extinction of language groups are beginning to receive attention

<h3 id="EduJus">6.3 Educational Justice</h3>

<p>
Applications of principles of distributive justice have figured
prominently in philosophical work on educational justice, but the
landscape of educational justice and injustice is complicated in ways
that make this inadequate. For one thing, there are often other forms
of justice&mdash;such as corrective justice&mdash;at stake in
decisions that have distributive significance, and children&rsquo;s
immaturity and developmental interests are fundamental to the
intersection of distributive and corrective justice in education.
There are also matters of relational equality, racial domination,
linguistic justice, educational justice for migrant and working
children, and others that complicate&mdash;or require more
than&mdash;a distributional perspective on justice. There are other
values at stake in educational policies and decisions, such as choice
and efficiency, a variety of institutional decision-makers, and a
spectrum of granular to system-level decisions that are significant
for justice. A comprehensive theory of educational justice would
presumably address all of the diverse forms of injustice that can
converge in educational institutions and practices, and it would
ideally offer guidance for the full range of educational decisions for
which considerations of justice are significant. There have been
gestures toward such a theory in recent years, including not only work
on a comprehensive approach to integrating values and evidence in
educational decision-making (Brighouse, Ladd et al. 2018), but also
work at the interfaces of inclusion and choice in education (Merry
2020), distributive, formative, and corrective justice (Curren 2013),
and corrective justice, racial justice, and gender equity in education
(Thompson &amp; Tillson 2020, 2023). There have also been efforts to
provide groundwork for a conception of educational justice as justice
in the development of children&rsquo;s potentialities (Thompson 2016),
and to develop cases and case analyses in which various aspects of
educational justice intersect (Levinson 2023a; Levinson &amp; Fay
2016, 2019; Levinson, Geron, et al. 2024; Levinson, Reid, et al.
2024).</p>

<h2 id="EmeIss">7. Emerging Issues</h2>

<p>
The immense volume and range of publications in philosophy of
education in recent years compounds the difficulty inherent in
identifying any handful of recently introduced topics as issues that
are &ldquo;emerging&rdquo; or destined to be more widely discussed in
the future. Developments in philosophy, education, and the wider world
will all make a difference to the issues that are addressed. Focusing
on developments in the wider world, climate related mass migration and
developments in artificial intelligence will pose philosophically rich
questions about educational justice, civic education, education and
work, and what education should be in a world of AIs. Climate driven
migration and information technology are already civically disruptive
forces that figure significantly in the present threats to democracy
and educational institutions posed by authoritarian movements,
nationalism, and civic polarization. These threats to democracy and
education are already attracting a great deal of attention in
philosophy of education&mdash;attention that is informed in varying
degrees by research in social epistemology, political science, and
social psychology. This work has been mostly focused on free speech,
academic freedom, and accusations of indoctrination, which are the
manifestations of these threats most acutely felt in classrooms and on
campuses. Where we go from here is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
