<p>
Leibniz was and is well known for his effort to answer the
philosophical and theological problems posed by evil. Already in his
own day he was gratified that his <em>Theodicy</em> (1710), a
book-length treatment of &ldquo;the goodness of God, the freedom of
man, and the origin of evil,&rdquo; had &ldquo;pleased excellent
theologians of all three main confessions&rdquo; (Antognazza 2009,
482&ndash;3). Voltaire&rsquo;s popular play, <em>Candide</em> (1759),
features Dr. Pangloss, whose refusal to acknowledge the badness of
things seems to caricature Leibniz&rsquo;s optimism. More recently,
scholars have given the problem of evil a central place in
Leibniz&rsquo;s thought (Rutherford 1995; Antognazza 2009). Major
projects have provided access to key texts (CP; LGR; DPG), insight
into the <em>Theodicy</em> itself (Rateau 2011; Jorgensen &amp;
Newlands 2014), and a synthetic understanding of Leibniz&rsquo;s
developing views (Rateau 2019).</p>

<p>
This entry follows Leibniz&rsquo;s effort to credit God for good while
excusing God of evil, beginning with his first attempts in the early
1670s and culminating in his most extensive and popular published
work, the <em>Theodicy</em> (Antognazza 2009, 480). The first section
outlines Leibniz&rsquo;s understanding of why evil presents a problem
for his conceptions of God, freedom, and creation. The second section
presents Leibniz&rsquo;s first attempt at a complete answer, and the
final section focuses on the emergence and coherence of
Leibniz&rsquo;s mature view.</p>

<h2 id="HowLeiUndProEvi">1. How Leibniz Understood the Problem of Evil</h2>

<p>
The full title of the <em>Theodicy</em> is <em>Essays on the Goodness
of God, the Freedom of Man, and the Origin of Evil</em> [<em>Essais de
Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e sur la bont&eacute; de Dieu, la libert&eacute;
de l&rsquo;homme et l&rsquo;origine du mal</em>]. Similarly,
Leibniz&rsquo;s early account of evil in the <em>Confessio
philosophi</em> (1672&ndash;73?) begins by establishing an equivalence
between &ldquo;the happiness of the mind&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;contemplation of God,&rdquo; and only then raises questions
about the origin of evil and the degree of human responsibility for
evil within a world created and governed by God (CP, 31). Indeed, it
is impossible to separate Leibniz&rsquo;s treatment of evil from his
broader understanding of divine goodness and human freedom. This
section explains why Leibniz took evil to be a threat to the goodness
of God. The following section explains how Leibniz&rsquo;s earliest
attempts to defeat that threat seem to undermine human freedom and
moral responsibility.</p>

<p>
Leibniz consistently maintained that God is worthy of love and praise,
and that God&rsquo;s worthiness may be discerned by studying creation.
As he put it, &ldquo;the excellence of God&rsquo;s works can be
recognized by considering them in themselves&rdquo; and &ldquo;by
considering his works we can discover the creator&rdquo; (AG, 36).
This reasoning served a dual purpose: it provided an argument for the
existence of God and challenged theological voluntarism (H, 130), the
view that good and evil are determined by arbitrary divine decrees.
Theological voluntarism implied that anything God had willed would
have been &ldquo;good&rdquo; by fiat, and hence that created things in
themselves provide no reason to praise and love their creator (Nadler
2011, 176). Leibniz countered that &ldquo;even God discovers that some
things are good, or better than others [&hellip;] for God is endowed
with will [and] the will is under the rule of the good&rdquo; (SLT,
193). By &ldquo;discovers,&rdquo; Leibniz meant that the nature of
goodness precedes God&rsquo;s will and is grounded in &ldquo;the ideas
exhibiting the essences of things, which are found in [God]&rdquo;
(SLT, 194), analogous to how the geometrical features of circles are
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; in God&rsquo;s ideas, not arbitrarily
decreed. These ideas are necessary and eternal products of God&rsquo;s
own self-understanding (Nachtomy 2007, Chs. 1&ndash;2). God freely
manifests God&rsquo;s inherent goodness by creating a world. Within
this creation, some beings (minds) possess &ldquo;reason to examine
good and evil, and to choose between them&rdquo; (SLT, 92), enabling
them to recognize the goodness in creation and respond with love and
praise for God. The good exists originally in God, is expressed
through God&rsquo;s free act of creation, and finally is recognized
and admired by human intellect and will (H, 240).</p>

<p>
As Leibniz acknowledged, the prevalence of suffering, imperfection,
and injustice in the world poses a significant challenge to his view
that creation is an expression of God&rsquo;s goodness (H, 100; Rateau
2019, 1&ndash;5). How could the providential sponsor of every
creaturely action
 (<a href="#ConDivPerForSin">Section 3.2.2</a>)
 deserve love and praise if creatures sin? If &ldquo;the excellence of
God&rsquo;s works&rdquo; allows us to &ldquo;discover the
creator&rdquo; (AG, 36), does the evil in God&rsquo;s works allow us
to discover faults in the creator? Under pressure from everyday
interlocutors, from the works of Pierre Bayle under discussion at
court in Hannover (Antognazza 2009, 382 &amp; 480), and from his own
critical reflection, Leibniz saw the need to defend God from two
charges. The first charge was that God, as creator and preserver,
bears direct moral responsibility for evil. This has been called the
<em>author of sin</em> problem, following Leibniz&rsquo;s own
terminology (CP, xxi), but has also been called the &ldquo;physical
problem of evil&rdquo; (McDonough 2007, 33&ndash;34) and the
&ldquo;holiness problem&rdquo; (Murray and Greenberg, 2016). The
second charge was that God should have done better, even if God is not
directly responsible for sin and evil. This charge takes as a starting
point the common intuition, which Leibniz shared, that the world could
have been different, and specifically that it could have contained
less evil (H, 380). Whereas the modern problem of evil focuses on the
existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly benevolent God
(see the entry on
 <a href="../evil/">the problem of evil</a>),
 Leibniz&rsquo;s effort in the <em>Theodicy</em> was a defense of
God&rsquo;s worthiness: if God truly deserves praise and love for
creation, God must be somehow excused for the degree and the fact of
evil in creation (Horn 2024, 8&ndash;10).</p>

<p>
In a succinct early statement of the author of sin problem, Leibniz
wrote: &ldquo;He who knowingly permits sin, creates all the
opportunities for sin, and brings it about that the agent can do it,
indeed, provokes the will of the agent itself, and brings it about
that he wants to do it&mdash;while he nevertheless could hinder the
sin, indeed, could refrain from creating the opportunities and
provoking the will&mdash;is to be considered the author of sin&rdquo;
(CP, 21). Leibniz returned to the problem in the <em>Theodicy</em>,
where he promised to &ldquo;show how it is possible for everything to
depend upon God, for him to co-operate in all the actions of
creatures, even, if you will, to create these creatures continually,
and nevertheless not to be the author of sin&rdquo; (H, 63). Leibniz
considered various strategies that would distance God from evil. For
example, he first rejected and then carefully reconsidered the
traditional claim that evil is nothing in itself, so that God may
create everything positive and real in a sinful action and even concur
with a sinful agent without thereby creating evil
 (<a href="#EarWorBef167">Section 2.1</a>;
 see also McDonough 2007, 46). Another strategy, from the early
theodicy, allowed a more robust ontology of evil and instead nearly
eliminated the divine will&rsquo;s role in creation, thereby
undercutting God&rsquo;s <em>moral</em> responsibility for evil. The
mature theodicy attempted a synthesis: evil can only exist as a local
imperfection in some encompassing good; God permits the local
imperfections while positively willing the underlying and encompassing
goods.</p>

<p>
Leibniz states the second charge succinctly in the <em>Theodicy</em>
itself: &ldquo;one must confess that there is evil in this world which
God has made, and that it would have been possible to make a world
without evil or even not to create any world, since its creation
depended upon the free will of God&rdquo; (H, 380; see also CP, 21).
With the further, plausible assumptions that God should do what is
best and that a world with less evil would have been better, it
follows that God <em>should</em> have done better. If the charge
holds, then there is a symmetry between good and evil in creation, the
latter reflecting badly on God just as former reflects well.
Leibniz&rsquo;s answer developed significantly. In his early theodicy,
Leibniz denied that God could have done better, holding instead that
evil and good follow together and inevitably from God, who generates
or emanates all finite things as aspects of a single overarching
harmony. As already noted, this answer also helped Leibniz to answer
the charge that God is an author of sin, because what follows
inevitably or necessarily from God need not follow voluntarily.
 <a href="#ConPhi16773">Section 2.2</a>
 on the <em>Confessio philosophi</em> will more fully describe this
tandem answer to both charges.</p>

<p>
Eventually, Leibniz came to recognize that this answer is not
compatible with human freedom and moral responsibility, because it is
not compatible with their prerequisite, contingency (but see Sleigh
1996, 492; CP, xxxv; L&aelig;rke 2007; L&aelig;rke 2008). If all
things follow necessarily and inevitably from God&rsquo;s nature, then
human actions cannot be considered free in any meaningful sense. It
also threatened the idea that God is the author of anything (let alone
sin), rather than a mere &ldquo;metaphysical something, imaginary,
incapable of thought, will, action, as some make out, so that it would
be the same as if you said that God is nature, fate, fortune,
necessity, the World&rdquo; (DSR, 29; see also CP, 3 where Leibniz
only five years earlier had associated God with fate). The mature
theodicy took a different approach, by denying that a world
&ldquo;without sin and suffering [&hellip;] would have been
<em>better</em>&rdquo; (H, 131; see also H, 380). That is, Leibniz
argued that God should have created exactly this world, despite having
the power to create a different world with less evil, because this
world taken as a whole, sin and all, is better than any alternative.
Leibniz defended this new reply <em>a priori</em>, by returning to his
argument that a perfect being would only have chosen the best world,
and <em>a posteriori</em>, by suggesting ways in which sin, suffering,
and evil might characterize the world less deeply than it seems and
may even make an indispensable contribution to the world&rsquo;s
excellence and to the happiness of individual minds.</p>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s mature answer to the charge that God should have done
better is the famous doctrine that this world is the best of all
possible worlds&mdash;the world that expresses God&rsquo;s goodness to
the greatest extent possible. Whether this doctrine succeeds, on
Leibniz&rsquo;s own terms, depends on whether God&rsquo;s free choice
to create a world marked by evil makes God into the author of sin. The
challenge was to allow enough contingency for divine and human
freedom, thereby preserving divine providence and the possibility of
human sin, without transferring any moral responsibility for evil all
the way back to the creator. To meet this challenge, Leibniz developed
sophisticated accounts of good and evil, of necessity and contingency,
and of freedom and providence. These will be discussed in
 <a href="#LeiMatThe">Section 3</a>
 of this entry.</p>

<h2 id="LeiFirThe">2. Leibniz&rsquo;s First Theodicy</h2>

<p>
This section sets the stage by considering two early works, <em>On the
Omnipotence and Omniscience of God and the Freedom of Man</em>
(1670&ndash;71?) and the Letter to Magnus Wedderkopf (1671), and then
more closely examines Leibniz&rsquo;s first developed theodicy in the
<em>Confessio philosophi</em> (1672&ndash;3?). These works are
translated in Robert Sleigh&rsquo;s extremely helpful, dual-language
volume, <em>Confessio Philosophi: Papers Concerning the Problem of
Evil, 1671&ndash;1678</em>, cited below as CP.</p>

<h3 id="EarWorBef167">2.1 Early Works (Before 1672)</h3>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s first known attempt to resolve the problem of evil is
an incomplete German language work now called <em>On the Omnipotence
and Omniscience of God and the Freedom of Man</em> (1670&ndash;71?).
The work begins by distinguishing two questions: &ldquo;how the free
will of man, punishment, and reward can exist, given the omnipotence
and omniscience of an all-ruling God,&rdquo; and how divine
predestination is compatible with the &ldquo;misery of the
pious&rdquo; (CP, 5). This distinction corresponds to the two charges
mentioned in the previous section. The all-ruling God seems to be the
author of creation, the party ultimately responsible, and so it is
questionable for God to hold created beings accountable. Likewise, it
seems God could have protected the innocent from suffering.</p>

<p>
Leibniz dismissed the second question by appeal to a final judgement
that permanently relieves the pious and damns the wicked.
Unfortunately, the appeal to damnation only makes the first
question&mdash;the author of sin problem&mdash;more difficult to
answer. If God is ultimately responsible for creation, the damned are
in a sense predestined, and this seems to be an especially great
miscarriage of justice if, as Sleigh writes, &ldquo;the ultimate
grounds for creaturely behavior that allegedly merits reward or
punishment are beyond the control of the person so rewarded or
punished and, in fact, reside in the one who rewards or
punishes&rdquo; (CP, 145). Rateau agrees: &ldquo;predestination is the
heart of the problem. It is the central question to which all the
others&mdash;human freedom, divine providence, moral and physical
concurrence with evil, divine justice&mdash;are connected&rdquo;
(Rateau 2019, 37).</p>

<p>
For Leibniz, this was a first-order philosophical and theological
problem, but also a source of enormous political and psychological
strife. Previous efforts to address the problem, from the patristic
period through the Reformation, confused the intellectual issues,
&ldquo;awakened so many sects,&rdquo; and made God into a
&ldquo;pretense&rdquo; for political cruelty and private moral
laziness (CP, 6&ndash;7). Solving this problem in a manner
&ldquo;sufficient to explain the issue that nevertheless cannot be
contradicted by anybody&rdquo; would restore God&rsquo;s honor and
also eliminate a great source of human suffering (CP, 9). Leibniz
aimed to provide just such a popular solution, which goes some way
toward explaining why <em>On the Omnipotence</em> was written in an
informal German, the <em>Confessio philosophi</em> was written as an
engaging dialogue, and the <em>Theodicy</em> was seen through to
publication (Antognazza 2009, 480&ndash;482).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, this solution proved hard to find. In <em>On the
Omnipotence</em>, Leibniz tried to resolve the problem by adopting
what Rateau (2019, 39) calls a &ldquo;strictly juridical point of
view.&rdquo; Under this approach, the divine judge, like a human judge
in a criminal trial, only asks whether the defendant acted
deliberately, and whether the action was illegal. If both conditions
are met, then the defendant is culpable, regardless of any extenuating
circumstances. In a human court, a judge is not held responsible for
various contributing factors, like poverty, upbringing, or even
coercion, so long as the defendant&rsquo;s will is not completely
overridden. Similarly, Leibniz argued, God is only concerned with
whether a creature deliberately willed an action that violated divine
law. If so, then the creature is guilty and deserves punishment. The
fact that God foresees the sin does not relieve this culpability,
because God also foresees that it is the sinner&rsquo;s fault:
&ldquo;if God has foreseen the end, he has also foreseen the
means&rdquo; (CP, 17). This juridical solution appears theologically
inadequate, however, because, unlike most human judges, God
&ldquo;creates all the opportunities for sin, and brings it about that
the agent can do it, indeed, provokes the will of the agent itself,
and brings it about that he wants to do it&rdquo; (CP, 21).</p>

<p>
Leibniz could see the need to further distance God from evil, but
before ending abruptly mid-sentence, the remainder of <em>On the
Omnipotence</em> rejected two traditional ways of supplying this
distance. The first is the Augustinian position that &ldquo;sin is a
nothing,&rdquo; a mere &ldquo;lack of the appropriate
perfection,&rdquo; such that God could be credited with creating
everything and every perfection, including the sinful will and its
effects, without thereby creating the sinfulness of either. Leibniz
attacks this position with uncharacteristic sarcasm, on the ground
that the position is absurd and, if true, would absolve sinner and God
alike, leaving no one responsible for sin (CP, 23). It is absurd to
claim credit for two bowings of the violin but not for the resulting
dissonance, and were that allowed, no one could be held responsible.
The second is the broad family of attempts to preserve divine
foreknowledge while giving the human will complete causal control over
its own determinations. Leibniz mentioned the Jesuit theologians, Luis
de Molina (1535&ndash;1600) and Pedro da Fonseca (1528&ndash;1599),
famous for the theory of middle knowledge on which God knows, prior to
any act of creative will, how potentially existing creatures would
freely behave in various circumstances. Even this subtle theory is
lacking, Leibniz claimed, because counterfactual conditionals of
creaturely freedom cannot be derived from God&rsquo;s attributes and
yet remain contingent (CP, 27; see also CP 130; Murray 1995; Sleigh
1994; and the entry on
 <a href="../free-will-foreknowledge/">foreknowledge and free will</a>).
 As the piece breaks off, the reader is left to conclude that sin
cannot be reduced to nothing and cannot be neatly severed from
God&rsquo;s own being and activity&mdash;leaving only the unsatisfying
juridical solution in place.</p>

<p>
Another work, likely postdating <em>On the Omnipotence</em> by some
months (A II.i.117&ndash;8), shows that Leibniz continued to
experiment with solutions. Writing to Magnus Wedderkopf, Leibniz
reiterated the juridical view that the sinner (as the proximate cause
of sin) deserves punishment even though the omnipotent and omniscient
&ldquo;God is the author of absolutely everything&rdquo; (CP, 3; see
also Sleigh&rsquo;s interpretive note at CP, 144). So, Pilate deserved
damnation because he lacked faith, even though he lacked faith because
he did not understand its value and this in turn for reasons that
trace back to God. Here, however, Leibniz defended a novel version of
the Augustinian view. Rather than accept that sin is nothing (and so
never created), he claimed instead that &ldquo;nothing is to be
considered absolutely evil.&rdquo; Whether something counts as an evil
depends, in part, on how broadly it is considered. So, Pilate wills a
sin and deserves punishment, but God wills Pilate&rsquo;s sin
<em>together with its punishment</em> and deserves praise:
&ldquo;[t]aken together with punishment or atonement, sins are good,
i.e., harmonious. For there is no harmony except as a result of
contraries.&rdquo; Considering things in the broadest way possible,
God brings about &ldquo;the most perfect harmony&rdquo; and could not
have done any better (CP, 3&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
As in <em>On the Omnipotence</em>, Leibniz did not claim to have met
his goal to quiet the distress caused by predestination in words
&ldquo;sufficient to explain the issue that nevertheless cannot be
contradicted by anybody&rdquo; (CP, 9). Rather, he described his
solution as &ldquo;harsh&rdquo; and asked Wedderkopf not to share it
with anyone (CP, 5).</p>

<h3 id="ConPhi16773">2.2 The <em>Confessio philosophi</em> (1672&ndash;73)</h3>

<p>
The most complete, early attempt to resolve these problems is the
<em>Confessio philosophi</em>, a Latin dialogue between a philosopher
who voices Leibniz&rsquo;s views and a theologian who raises robust
objections and concerns. The manuscript history is complex, and
interested readers should turn to Sleigh&rsquo;s translation and
commentary (CP, xv&ndash;xxiv). For example, there is a revised
version of the last quarter of the dialogue. There is also a written
&ldquo;Conversation with Steno&rdquo; and marginal comments to the
<em>Confessio</em> in the handwriting of Nicholas Steno
(1638&ndash;86), a Danish scientist and Catholic theologian present
with Leibniz at the court of Johann Friedrich (Antognazza 2009, 202).
Steno&rsquo;s comments, Leibniz&rsquo;s handwritten replies, and the
original conversation with Steno likely occurred in late 1677 and
early 1678, around the time Leibniz revised the dialogue&rsquo;s end
(CP, xxiii&ndash;xxiv). Leibniz&rsquo;s thinking about evil developed
significantly during these years, and these later manuscripts
sometimes reflect views more characteristic of his mature theodicy.
This section focuses on the original version from 1672/3, in which
Leibniz worked out a solution to the problems raised in <em>On the
Omnipotence</em> and the Letter to Wedderkopf.</p>

<p>
The <em>Confessio</em> continues Leibniz&rsquo;s focus on the author
of sin problem, which the dialogue presents forcefully in an extended
passage on Judas and his motivational state before suicide. The
psychological realism of this passage is driven by a commitment the
philosopher and theologian share, that &ldquo;nothing exists without a
reason&rdquo; (CP, 35). For example, having noted that Judas came to
recognize his own evil before dying, the theologian asks: &ldquo;You
could say more briefly that he was at the same time <em>penitent</em>
<em>and in despair.</em> But what is the source of this state of his
soul?&rdquo; (CP, 35). The philosopher acknowledges that such
questions will continue indefinitely, moving from cause to cause, and
that only a &ldquo;self-sufficient&rdquo; being could ultimately
satisfy the demand for reasons. Since the pair have already accepted a
demonstration that God exists as the ultimate ground of everything
(CP, 35), they are driven to admit that God is also the ultimate
ground of Judas&rsquo;s final despair: the &ldquo;ultimate ground for
sin, like everything else, and hence even for damnation, is God&rdquo;
(CP, 38-39).</p>

<p>
After a long pause, the philosopher proposes a novel argument: God can
be the ground of sin without being the author of sin so long as
God&rsquo;s will is not involved in the grounding story. God does not
cause mathematical truths to be true by willing them; rather, they are
true simply because God understands them, and God understands them
simply because God exists (CP, 43). In the same way, God is the ground
of sin through the divine intellect, but in no way wills that there be
sin. &ldquo;Sins,&rdquo; the philosopher explains, &ldquo;are not due
to the divine <em>will</em> but rather to the divine
<em>understanding</em> or, what is the same, to the eternal ideas or
the nature of things&rdquo; (CP, 41).</p>

<p>
The argument is at least initially puzzling, because mathematical
truths are necessary, eternal, and abstract&mdash;whereas sin seems to
be contingent, temporal, and concrete. Leibniz admitted this by having
the theologian answer: &ldquo;I see, but I await your reply avidly and
with wonder concerning in what light can sins be viewed&rdquo; (CP,
41). The novelty of the solution, it turns out, consists in holding
that truths about sin are themselves quasi-mathematical, akin to the
necessary relationships that govern musical harmony. Just as a musical
piece may contain dissonant chords that, when properly resolved,
contribute to the beauty of the composition, the existence of sin is a
local discord that contributes to &ldquo;a universal harmony of
things, thus distinguishing the light by means of shadows&rdquo; (CP,
43&ndash;-45). Somehow, the temporal and concrete reality of sin is
assimilated to the eternal and abstract realm of harmonics. As the
theologian summarizes, &ldquo;the universal harmony is a result not of
the will of God but the intellect of God, or of the ideas, that is,
the nature of things. Therefore sins are to be ascribed to the same
thing; accordingly, sins follow from the existence of God, not the
will of God&rdquo; (CP, 45).</p>

<p>
We can make sense of this solution by returning to the original
problem, as outlined in
 <a href="#HowLeiUndProEvi">Section 1</a>.
 Creation, including sin and punishment, continue to express
God&rsquo;s goodness if sin and punishment are not blemishes in
God&rsquo;s work, but instead mutually complementary parts of a larger
harmony. Arguments for the existence of God that begin with creation
would still lead to the existence of a perfectly good God. Moreover,
God is relieved of direct moral responsibility for sin if God never
wills that sin occur, and God need never will that sin occur if the
universal harmony follows from the mere existence of God. The
will&rsquo;s activity is situated posterior to the divine intellect
that grounds the existence of finite things (Rateau 2019, 65&ndash;67;
Feeney 2020, 11), and so the will may respond selectively, delighted
by the universal harmony and its harmonious parts, but not by the
dissonant parts taken separately: &ldquo;to will in favor of something
is to be delighted by its existence&rdquo; (CP 55). That is, God
grounds everything just by knowing the universal harmony, but authors
nothing, because &ldquo;<em>[t]o be the author</em> is by one&rsquo;s
will to be the ground of something else&rdquo; (CP, 55).</p>

<p>
This solution also addresses the charge that God could have done
better and the lingering question of whether evil itself is nothing
(see
 <a href="#HowLeiUndProEvi">Section 1</a>
 and
 <a href="#EarWorBef167">Section 2.1</a>).
 God could not have done better if creation directly expresses
God&rsquo;s grasp of a universal harmony: there are no better
alternatives, and even the framing in terms of
&ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; seems inappropriate if God does not
exercise the divine will to choose. As to whether evil is nothing,
Leibniz combined his attack from <em>On the Omnipotence</em> with his
more conciliatory line in the letter to Wedderkopf, writing: &ldquo;I
suppose that this is what is meant by those who have said that the
substance of the act, but not the evil, is from God, although they
have been unable to explain how it is that the evil does not result
from the act. They would have said more correctly that God contributes
everything to sin except will, and accordingly he does not sin&rdquo;
(CP, 41). With <em>On the Omnipotence</em>, there is no way to bring
about a sin without bringing about its evil, but with the letter to
Wedderkopf, God never wills sin on its own and for its own sake. God
wills sin only as part of a larger whole, and even then without
creative force.</p>

<p>
As signaled already in the dialogue, this is an extreme answer to the
charges. For example, it seems to imply that everything is necessary,
for there is no room left in the divine intellect for alternative
creations and no will left that could have chosen them instead. The
very distinction between creatures and God is weakened if God does not
author anything: &ldquo;to exist is nothing other than to be
harmonious&rdquo; and &ldquo;[&hellip;] to exist is nothing else but
to be understood to be good&rdquo; (DSR, 25 &amp; 67).</p>

<p>
This has generated some controversy in the literature. Robert Sleigh,
in his indispensable work on Leibniz&rsquo;s early theodicy, sketches
an interpretation of the early theodicy in the <em>Confessio
philosophi</em> that commits Leibniz to a broadly Spinozistic
necessitarianism (Sleigh 1996, 492; CP, xxxv; also L&aelig;rke 2007, 8
&amp; 20&ndash;1; L&aelig;rke 2008, 380&ndash;381, 547&ndash;551 &amp;
795&ndash;796). Sleigh rejects this interpretation, however, because
it does not fit with Leibniz&rsquo;s later rejection of
necessitarianism, and does not seem to fit with Leibniz&rsquo;s
efforts, already in the <em>Confessio</em>, to carve out a sense in
which created things exist contingently (CP, 55&ndash;59). In
contrast, Rateau (2019, 72) and Feeney (2020, 1&ndash;2) emphasize
that Leibniz&rsquo;s efforts to resist necessitarianism in the
<em>Confessio</em> do nothing to strengthen the divine will or rescue
human freedom, aims that emerge fully only later, after
Leibniz&rsquo;s decisive encounter with Spinoza in 1676 (see also
Nachtomy 2008). It may be helpful to recall that Leibniz wrote the
first version of the <em>Confessio</em> in his mid-20s, shortly after
writing other, shorter works that experiment with strong replies to
evil. Leibniz himself may have been drawn in multiple, irreconcilable
directions.</p>

<h2 id="LeiMatThe">3. Leibniz&rsquo;s Mature Theodicy</h2>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s mature theodicy emerged gradually over several decades
through the effort to reconcile evil, divine providence, and
creaturely freedom. Key texts after Leibniz&rsquo;s arrival in
Hannover in 1676 and before the <em>Theodicy</em> (1710) reveal a
sustained effort to move beyond the necessitarian implications of his
early attempts. This section will note important philosophical
developments along the way and present the <em>Theodicy</em> itself.
The following subsections will present the view that book contains:
Leibniz&rsquo;s &ldquo;best possible world&rdquo; solution to the
charge that God should have done better
 (<a href="#BesAllPosWor">Section 3.1</a>)
 and the distinctions that relieve God of moral responsibility for
evil
 (<a href="#WhoAutSin">Section 3.2</a>).
 Finally, the entry will close with Leibniz&rsquo;s views on
redemptive suffering, or how humans should approach being a finite and
vulnerable part of the best world
 (<a href="#MeaSuf">Section 3.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The revisions to the <em>Confessio</em>, along with the notes
connected with Nicholas Steno (both dated to 1677/8), already show
important developments. Recall that in the original
<em>Confessio</em>, the existence of sin seemed to follow directly
from God&rsquo;s own existence (CP, 45). In the revisions, however,
Leibniz bolstered his rejection of necessitarianism by distinguishing
between <em>per se</em> and hypothetical necessity. This distinction
allowed him to argue that something could follow necessarily from
God&rsquo;s nature, yet not be necessary <em>per se</em> (in itself,
or absolutely) (CP, xxiv&ndash;xxv &amp; 55&ndash;7). For instance, in
the revised conclusion of the dialogue, Leibniz stated that sins are
&ldquo;not necessary, even if they follow from something
necessary&mdash;the existence of God or the harmony of things&rdquo;
(CP, 59). The existence of the world might be a necessary consequence
of God&rsquo;s nature (<em>hypothetical</em> necessity), but not a
consequence of its own nature (<em>per se</em> necessity). Likewise,
the specific features of the world, including the occurrence of sin,
are not themselves absolutely or <em>per se</em> necessary. Crucially,
limiting the created world to hypothetical necessity allowed him to
consider other worlds as possible in themselves. Furthermore, in his
replies to Steno&rsquo;s comments, Leibniz defended a more active role
for the divine will in creation. He wrote that &ldquo;the series
[i.e., the actual world] is not posited because God is posited, except
for the fact that God, who is the most-wise being, wills nothing but
the best. All possible series are in the idea of God, but only one
under the aspect of the best&rdquo; (CP, 47). This represented a
significant departure from the earlier <em>Confessio</em>, where the
divine will played a minimal role, limited to mere approval of a
pre-existing harmony. By assigning a more active role to God&rsquo;s
will, Leibniz could maintain that other worlds were not only possible
in themselves, but also within God&rsquo;s power to create. This
opened room for Leibniz to argue that God exercised agency
<em>and</em> could not have done better, having <em>chosen</em> the
best world.</p>

<p>
Many writings from 1680s and 1690s laid further philosophical
groundwork for Leibniz&rsquo;s mature theodicy. The <em>Discourse on
Metaphysics</em> (1686) provided a detailed exposition of the complete
concept doctrine of substance (AG, 40&ndash;42), and a series of works
from 1689 introduced infinite analysis to explain contingency within
the framework of complete concepts (A, VI.iv.1649&ndash;1664; AG, 28
&amp; 96&ndash;97). These developments allowed Leibniz to maintain
that God eternally grasps the complete concept of each possible
individual substance <em>and</em> that finite deduction cannot
demonstrate all the predicates in a given complete concept. Some
features of finite substances are contingent, because there would be
no (provable) logical contradiction in holding that a particular
substance could have been different (see McDonough &amp; Soysal,
2018). This supplemented the distinction between <em>per se</em> and
hypothetical necessity. The world and all its parts are at most
hypothetically necessary <em>and</em> any particular substance could
have developed differently without contradiction (for orientation on
Leibniz&rsquo;s modal theories, see the entry on
 <a href="../leibniz-modal/">Leibniz&rsquo;s modal metaphysics</a>).
 These two levels or sources of contingency were crucial for escaping
the necessitarianism of Leibniz&rsquo;s earlier efforts, and they
provided metaphysical context for Leibniz&rsquo;s mature account of
moral agency (Jorati 2017). They also supported Leibniz&rsquo;s claim
that God foreknows and even foreordains creaturely actions without
thereby <em>necessitating</em> them (H, 150).</p>

<p>
The <em>New System</em> (1695) publicly articulated Leibniz&rsquo;s
account of substance, mind-body interaction, and pre-established
harmony as a test for the eventual release of his views on evil, fate
and contingency (G, I.423; cited at Rateau 2019, 143). Drawing on his
philosophy of science and his mathematical doctrine of optimal form,
<em>On the Ultimate Origination of Things</em> (1697) provided a model
of what it means for this world to be best (McDonough 2022, 142). This
work also argued that the mathematical optimality of the world, on
display in its physical principles, makes this world morally perfect
as well, because &ldquo;moral perfection is in reality physical
perfection with respect to minds&rdquo; (AG, 152&ndash;3). That is,
the best world for an intelligent being is the most intelligible
world. After acknowledging that experience often runs counter to this
conclusion, Leibniz tested some <em>a posteriori</em> defenses of the
&ldquo;best world&rdquo; thesis. These works, alongside exchanges with
Arnauld, Bayle, Des Bosses and others, prepared the ground for
Leibniz&rsquo;s eventual account of evil, divine creation, and human
freedom in the <em>Theodicy</em>.</p>

<p>
The direct impetus for writing the Theodicy came from conversations at
the Prussian court with Sophie Charlotte and others concerning
Bayle&rsquo;s <em>Dictionnaire historique et critique</em>
(2<sup>nd</sup> edition, 1702). Leibniz, eager to defend religious
truth and the conformity of faith with reason, saw an opportunity to
refute Bayle&rsquo;s objections and to clarify his own views on
God&rsquo;s justice in a world marked by evil. These courtly
exchanges, later &ldquo;stitched together&rdquo; and expanded at the
urging of friends, formed the basis for the published
<em>Theodicy</em> (Antognazza 2009, 382 &amp; 421). The book was
finally published by Isaac Troyel of Amsterdam in 1710 under the title
<em>Essais de Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e sur la bont&eacute; de Dieu, la
libert&eacute; de l&rsquo;homme et l&rsquo;origine du mal</em>.
Written in French, the work sought a wider audience than a Latin text
would have, and it was the most substantial philosophical work that
Leibniz published during his lifetime. Nevertheless, Leibniz chose to
publish anonymously, claiming authorship only in the second edition in
1712 (Lodge 2020, 173). The term &ldquo;theodicy&rdquo; was
Leibniz&rsquo;s own coinage, derived from the Greek words
<em>theos</em> (God) and <em>dike</em> (justice), and intended to
signify &ldquo;the doctrine of the right and justice of God&rdquo; (G,
II.428; cited at Lodge 2020, 173). He had first used the term in its
French and Latin forms in the mid-1690s, in letters and fragments that
attest to his ongoing desire to establish and communicate clear
metaphysical foundations for the reunification of Christian churches
(Antognazza 2009, 480&ndash;1).</p>

<p>
The <em>Theodicy</em> itself is divided into three main parts,
preceded by a substantial &ldquo;Preliminary Dissertation on the
Conformity of Faith with Reason&rdquo; and followed by several
appendices. The first part addresses the problem of evil in general,
laying out Leibniz&rsquo;s fundamental principles and arguments. The
second and third parts revisit these themes in an ongoing dialogue
with Pierre Bayle (Lodge 2020, 174 &amp; 183). The appendices are
titled, &ldquo;Summary of the Controversy, Reduced to Formal
Argument,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reflections on the Work that Mr. Hobbes
Published in English on Freedom, Necessity and Chance,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Observations on the Book Concerning the Origin of Evil,
Published Recently in London.&rdquo; Finally, a condensed, Latin
summary of the main arguments, titled &ldquo;A Vindication of
God&rsquo;s Justice Reconciled with His Other Perfections and All His
Actions,&rdquo; now commonly called the <em>Causa Dei</em>, was added
to the second edition (Lodge 2020, 174&ndash;5). E. M. Huggard
published an English translation from the French in 1952, using
Gerhardt&rsquo;s edition from the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century. This
is the only complete English translation of the <em>Theodicy</em>. It
leaves some Latin quotes untranslated, lacks a scholarly apparatus,
and omits the philosophically rich <em>Causa Dei</em>&mdash;which may
be found in <em>Monadology and Other Philosophical Essays</em>
(S).</p>

<p>
The <em>Theodicy</em> directly addresses &ldquo;the great question of
the Free and the Necessary [&hellip;] in the production and the origin
of Evil&rdquo; (H, 55) in a manner that attempts to preserve
God&rsquo;s goodness as creator, preserver, and providential governor
of a world replete with moral evil, suffering, and imperfection.
Leibniz aims to absolve God and hold human beings appropriately
responsible for sin, but in a way that is ultimately consoling,
reassuring his readers that they are integral parts of a world that
richly expresses God&rsquo;s goodness, and that they may find genuine
happiness and tranquility in the love of God (H, 53&ndash;57).</p>

<h3 id="BesAllPosWor">3.1 The Best of All Possible Worlds</h3>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s argument that God could not have done better, or that
we inhabit the best of all possible worlds, is mostly <em>a
priori</em> and grounded in God&rsquo;s nature. As a supremely perfect
being, God is both perfectly wise and perfectly good. Wisdom enabled
God to recognize the most perfect world among all possible
combinations of substances (H, 271), and goodness morally necessitated
God to choose that world (H, 239&ndash;240). As Leibniz stated, God
&ldquo;would reproach himself for the slightest actual defect there
were in the universe, even though it were perceived of none&rdquo; (H
282). Since any choice other than the best would indicate a defect, a
perfect God must select the best.</p>

<p>
The argument so far assumes there is a best possible world, rather
than an infinite series of ever better worlds (see Adams 1972).
Leibniz defended this assumption by appeal to this world&rsquo;s
existence. God would have chosen not to create at all had there been
no best world, because there would have been no sufficient reason to
pick any world over its better. The existence of this world proves
there is a best world, and God&rsquo;s nature proves that this world
<em>is</em> the best world. As Leibniz put it in the
<em>Theodicy</em>, &ldquo;a lesser good is a kind of evil&rdquo; and
&ldquo;if there were not the best (<em>optimum</em>) among all
possible worlds, God would not have produced any&rdquo; (H, 131 &amp;
252&ndash;253).</p>

<p>
Despite their apparent simplicity, Leibniz&rsquo;s arguments require a
sophisticated metaphysical foundation. For example, Leibniz associated
optimality with metaphysical perfection (AG, 39), metaphysical
perfection with unity (A, VI.i.484&ndash;5; SLT, 191&ndash;2), and
this in turn with substances (ARN, 171 &amp; 181&ndash;211). Since a
world is an aggregate of substances and not one substance, finding its
degree of perfection and choosing it above all others requires the
many substances to be reckoned as one, as a unit: &ldquo;I call
&lsquo;World&rsquo; the whole succession and the whole agglomeration
of all existent things, lest it be said that several worlds could have
existed in different times and different places. For they must needs
be reckoned all together as one world or, if you will, as one
Universe&rdquo; (H, 131 &amp; 271; see also A, VI.iv.559&ndash;60).
This requires Leibniz to specify a function or reckoning from possible
substances to collections of possible substances (possible worlds),
and another function from these possible worlds to values, with one
collection coming out as best. The simplest candidate functions treat
any set of possible substances as a possible world and find the value
of a possible world by summing the value of its substances. These do
not work for Leibniz, because they imply that the best possible world
contains absolutely all possible substances. There is considerable
discussion in the secondary literature around these functions, the
first under the heading of &ldquo;compossibility&rdquo; (Messina &amp;
Rutherford 2009; Feeney 2016; Rutherford 2021) and the second under
&ldquo;harmony&rdquo; and &ldquo;metaphysical perfection&rdquo; (Gale
1976; Carlin 2000; Glowienka 2016; Newlands 2018, 33&ndash;41).</p>

<p>
Most of these foundations did not appear in the <em>Theodicy</em>,
which &ldquo;was already a very cautious work, targeted to a broad
public which Leibniz did not want to upset with his potentially most
controversial philosophical views (Antognazza 2009, 482).&rdquo; He
did, however, include a metaphysical account of evil. Moral and
physical evils, like sin and suffering, are grounded in what he called
&ldquo;metaphysical evil&rdquo; (H, 139 &amp; 279; CD, 29&ndash;32).
In the clearest definition, &ldquo;metaphysical good and evil is
perfection and imperfection in general,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;physical
good and evil [are] the conveniences and inconveniences of intelligent
substances,&rdquo; and &ldquo;moral good and evil concerns their
virtuous and vicious actions&rdquo; (G, VI.32 cited in Antognazza
2014, 119). As Antognazza (2014, 125&ndash;133) persuasively argues,
metaphysical evil is the &ldquo;original imperfection or limitation
connatural to all creatures&rdquo; (AG, 62) that Leibniz had already
mentioned in the <em>Discourse on Metaphysics</em>, where he wrote
that &ldquo;the root of evil is in nothingness, that is to say, in the
privation, or limitation of creatures, which God graciously remedies
by the degree of perfection it pleases him to give&rdquo; (AG, 62). No
matter how excellent the best possible world may be, its inhabitants
are inevitably less than God, and so originally imperfect. Once more
revising the Augustinian privation theory of evil (see
 <a href="#EarWorBef167">Section 2.1</a>),
 Leibniz used finitude itself to explain why creatures are vulnerable
to suffering (physical evil) and &ldquo;liable to sin&rdquo; (moral
evil) (AG, 62; see also H, 139). Leibniz, then, advocated a unified
account of this world&rsquo;s goodness: metaphysical perfection is the
source of moral goodness (AG, 152) and metaphysical evil is the
condition for the possibility of moral evil. A world&rsquo;s value
depends on its metaphysical foundation, but also on its physical and
moral aspects: &ldquo;it will prove that [God] has attained the utmost
good possible, provided one reckon the metaphysical, physical and
moral goods together&rdquo; (H, 282; see also Newlands 2014).</p>

<p>
The most pressing objection to the best-possible-world view is that
some things in the world could be better, which motivates the thought
that there could be a better world. Leibniz admitted this objection
and provided answers informed by recent scientific discoveries and by
his supposition that God fills every potential gap in creation with
life (ARN, 203&ndash;205). For example, there may be incomparably
happy creatures beyond the stars or inhabiting other planets:
&ldquo;It may be that all suns are peopled only by blessed
creatures&rdquo; (H, 138). He also appealed to the afterlife or the
final judgement: &ldquo;Here on earth we see apparent injustice, and
we believe and even know the truth of the hidden justice of God; but
we shall see that justice when at last the Sun of Justice shall show
himself as he is&rdquo; (H, 122). We are not situated to observe the
net goodness and happiness of our world, and so the dismal state of
our neighborhood does not license conclusions about creation as a
whole. Moreover, appealing to his underlying metaphysics of evil,
Leibniz argued that the world is biased toward good: &ldquo;perfection
is positive, it is an absolute reality; defect is privative, it comes
from limitation and tends towards new privations&rdquo; (H, 146).
There is no upper bound to the positive&mdash;one could always know
and be more&mdash;but there is a lower bound to the negative set by
nonexistence. In theological terms, &ldquo;God is infinite, and the
Devil is finite; good can and does go on <em>ad infinitum</em>,
whereas evil has its bounds&rdquo; (H, 381).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, these replies miss the core of the objection, which is
that our world could be better, not that it is overall bad. To answer
this, Leibniz needed to show that, possibly, improving the
neighborhood would not improve the world, or that local badness
contributes to global perfection. For this, Leibniz returned to a
theme present since his earliest theodicy, that the world is an
integral and harmonious whole no part of which may be changed without
disruption (see
 <a href="#ConPhi16773">Section 2.2</a>).
 &ldquo;God&rsquo;s pronouncement,&rdquo; Leibniz wrote,
&ldquo;concerns the whole sequence at the same time; he simply decrees
its existence. In order to save other men, or in a different way, he
must needs choose an altogether different sequence, seeing that all is
connected in each sequence&rdquo; (H, 171). Individual substances may
be really independent metaphysical units, but they all reflect each
other and each displays a single overarching plan or idea, and so no
part of a world may be swapped for something better without destroying
the metaphysical perfection of the world (AG, 47 &amp; 219&ndash;220).
Moreover, the evils we perceive contribute to a greater good: &ldquo;A
little acid, sharpness or bitterness is often more pleasing than
sugar; shadows enhance colors; and even a dissonance in the right
place gives relief to harmony. [&hellip;] And is it not most often
necessary that a little evil render the good more discernible, that is
to say, greater?&rdquo; (H, 133). Here, Leibniz continues a Platonic
tradition that includes Aquinas, who wrote that the &ldquo;universe,
the present creation being supposed, cannot be better, on account of
the most beautiful order given to things by God. &hellip; For if any
one thing were bettered, the proportion of order would be destroyed;
as if one string were stretched more than it ought to be, the melody
of the harp would be destroyed&rdquo; (Aquinas, <em>Summa
Theologiae</em>, I.25.6.ad3 as quoted in Pruss 2020, 206&ndash;7; see
also Mercer 2008).</p>

<p>
In Leibniz&rsquo;s mature theodicy, God&rsquo;s wisdom and goodness
collaborate to create the best possible world. The role of wisdom is
to grasp eternal, necessary truths, the possible essences of all
things, and compile these into an array of possible worlds ranked by
their degree of perfection. God&rsquo;s goodness dictates that God
will the best, the world that achieves the greatest overall harmony
and reflects that harmony in its constituent parts. The parts
themselves, especially intelligent and free creatures, contribute
positively to that harmony by adding physical and moral good to the
whole. Evils are inevitable, because even the best world falls short
of divinity and because this falling short allows suffering and sin as
the shadow of physical and moral good. Even these evils, however,
enrich the whole and contribute to its perfection, and God would not
have done better by eliminating them.</p>

<h3 id="WhoAutSin">3.2 Who is the Author of Sin?</h3>

<p>
Since the best possible world contains moral evils, Leibniz also
addressed the charge that God is the author of sin. Leibniz&rsquo;s
mature account of divine and creaturely freedom generated this charge
in three ways, which appear already in the opening paragraphs of the
<em>Theodicy</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
The foreknowledge of God renders all the future certain and
determined, but his providence and his foreordinance, whereon
foreknowledge itself appears founded, do much more: for God is not as
a man, able to look upon events with unconcern and to suspend his
judgement, since nothing exists save as a result of the decrees of his
will and through the action of his power. [&hellip;] it appears that
man is compelled to do the good and evil that he does, and in
consequence that he deserves therefor neither recompense nor
chastisement: thus is the morality of actions destroyed and all
justice, divine and human, shaken. (H, 126&ndash;127)
</blockquote>

<p>
First, it seems God chose a world in which there is sin and suffering
and thereby wills sin and suffering. Second, it seems God did not
merely will these evils but actually concurred or cooperated with
them, &ldquo;through the action of his power.&rdquo; Finally, it seems
there is no room left for human agency robust enough to support moral
responsibility for sin. Leibniz addressed these tensions between
divine providence and creaturely culpability by distinguishing
antecedent from consequent will, physical from moral concurrence, and
efficient from deficient causation.</p>

<h4 id="MorNecGodAntConWil">3.2.1 Moral Necessity, and God&rsquo;s Antecedent and Consequent Will</h4>

<p>
Leibniz rejected the following, plausible conditional: <em>if God
chose freely and morally to actualize a world that contains sin and
suffering, then God is responsible for evil</em>. His rejection
involved a distinction between God&rsquo;s antecedent and consequent
wills. However, before describing this distinction, it will be helpful
to see how Leibniz defended the antecedent. Leibniz appealed to
&ldquo;moral necessity&rdquo; to explain how God created the best
world freely and morally, despite being in a sense compelled by
goodness.</p>

<p>
Leibniz was concerned to clear up what he considered a terminological
confusion: if <em>necessarily, God wills the best</em> and
<em>necessarily, there is one world which is best, viz. our
world</em>, then <em>necessarily, our world exists</em>&mdash;or in
Leibniz&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;there is nothing possible except
that which actually happens&rdquo; (H, 232; argument summary from
Murray 2014, 154). The terminological confusion is not between
hypothetical and <em>per se</em> necessity, because God&rsquo;s own
nature appears to preclude the existence of sub-optimal worlds, even
if these worlds are possible in themselves (see
 <a href="#LeiMatThe">Section 3</a>).
 Instead, the confusion is between metaphysical necessity and
&ldquo;moral necessity,&rdquo; a necessity grounded in practical
wisdom and moral perfection (see Rateau 2019, 203&ndash;215). Just as
we are confident that a wise person will forego real but extremely
foolish options (H, 302), we may also be sure that God, though free,
is &ldquo;morally necessitated&rdquo; to choose the best. This is a
subtle point about practical reason: even unthinkable deeds are
doable, and the choices that spring automatically from settled
character are nevertheless free and have genuine moral significance.
The argument above is a mere terminological confusion, because the
first premise involves moral necessity, while the second premise
involves metaphysical necessity. This appeal to moral necessity runs
exactly counter to Leibniz&rsquo;s early answer to the author of sin
problem, which had relied on the metaphysical necessity of the best to
shield God from fault for willing evil (see
 <a href="#ConPhi16773">Section 2.2</a>).
 However certain the choice, God did freely and morally create a world
marked by sin and suffering.</p>

<p>
Having defended the antecedent, Leibniz challenged the conditional by
distinguishing between God&rsquo;s antecedent and consequent wills
(see Echavarr&iacute;a 2014; Murray 2014; Schmaltz 2014). The
antecedent will is an interior recognition of possible goods as good.
God is inclined to the good and so has a reason to create everything
that would be good if it existed. As Leibniz stated,</p>

<blockquote>
will consists in the inclination to do something in proportion to the
good it contains. This will is called <em>antecedent</em> when it is
detached, and considers each good separately in the capacity of a
good. In this sense it may be said that God tends to all good, as good
[&hellip;] He is earnestly disposed to sanctify and to save all men,
to exclude sin, and to prevent damnation. (H, 139&ndash;140)
</blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz even ventured that God&rsquo;s antecedent will would be
efficacious if it were unimpeded, and since the only available
impediment is God&rsquo;s own will, it must be that the will to create
some finite substances is not compatible with the will to create
certain others, as suggested already in
 <a href="#BesAllPosWor">Section 3.1</a>.
 The many antecedent wills&mdash;one for each potential
good&mdash;must then compose themselves into a single, unified act of
will that the overall best should exist. This unified act of will is
God&rsquo;s <em>consequent</em> will, which is &ldquo;final and
decisive&rdquo; (H, 139&ndash;140). With this distinction in hand,
Leibniz could claim that God antecedently wills all goods, even those
not actualized like universal salvation. He could also recast
God&rsquo;s will to create evils as a byproduct of the contest among
antecedent wills, which &ldquo;produce effects [&hellip;] restricted
by the concurrence of other antecedent acts of will&rdquo; (CD,
26&ndash;27).</p>

<p>
God is not responsible for evil because God has no antecedent will for
evil, and a consequent will for evil only insofar as evil is
inextricably part of the best. Specifically, God wills physical evils
like suffering only to maximize the good and never for their own sake;
moral evils like sin are not willed at all, but only permitted to
exist (H, 140&ndash;1). This fits well with Leibniz&rsquo;s account of
sin as an integral part of a global harmony (as discussed already in
 <a href="#ConPhi16773">Section 2.2</a>),
 and with his account of moral evil as arising from the inevitable
metaphysical imperfections of finite things (as in
 <a href="#BesAllPosWor">Section 3.1</a>).
 In a sense, the reason why the best world contains evil also explains
why choosing the best world does not make God morally responsible for
its evil. Leibniz answered one charge with a holism about value, and
the other with a parallel holism about God&rsquo;s voluntary response
to value.</p>

<h4 id="ConDivPerForSin">3.2.2 Concurrence and Divine Permission for Sin</h4>

<p>
God&rsquo;s concurrence with every creaturely action raises the author
of sin problem again, even given the distinction between antecedent
and consequent willing. Suffering may be willed only for the sake of
another good, and sin may be permitted only as <em>sine qua
non</em>&mdash;but God still participates in bringing about these
evils &ldquo;through the action of his power,&rdquo; and this seems
like enough to make God morally responsible. Leibniz offered a
comprehensive statement about concurrence in the <em>Causa
Dei</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>In their actions</em> all things depend upon God, since God
concurs in their actions in so far as these actions have some degree
of perfection, which must always come from God. God&rsquo;s
<em>concurrence</em> (even the ordinary, non-miraculous concurrence)
is at the same time immediate and special. It is <em>immediate</em>
since the effect depends upon God not only for the reason that its
cause originates in God, but also for this other reason, that God
concurs no less nor more indirectly in producing this effect than in
producing its cause. The concurrence is <em>special</em> because it
aims not only at the existence of the thing and its actions, but also
at the mood and qualities of this existence in so far as there is
inherent in them some degree of perfection, which always flows from
God, the father of light and dispenser of all good. (CD, 10&ndash;12)
</blockquote>

<p>
As Leibniz wrote, God concurs without mediation: God creates the agent
who acts <em>and</em> God has a part in that agent&rsquo;s action.
Divine concurrence is also special, or specific. To use
McDonough&rsquo;s toaster analogy, God has a hand in the toasting
itself and is not a mere source of generic power enabling the toaster
to operate (McDonough 2007, 43). It might seem, then, that God is
actively and intimately involved in every detail of every effect,
including the evil in sinful actions, &ldquo;for an action is not, for
being evil, the less dependent on God&rdquo; (H, 127).</p>

<p>
Leibniz, however, also wrote that God&rsquo;s concurrence is limited
to the perfection, the goodness, the positivity in any substance or
action&mdash;which would be enough to show that God does not concur
with sin as sin, and so that divine concurrence does not make God the
author of sin. The difficulty, then, was to limit concurrence to the
perfection in actions while still maintaining that &ldquo;actual
beings depend upon God for their existence as well as for their
actions, and depend not only upon his intellect but also upon his
will&rdquo; (CD, 9; see also H, 142&ndash;3). How can God be so
thoroughly involved in causing every creaturely action, and yet only
concur with the good in those actions?</p>

<p>
Leibniz answered by dividing God&rsquo;s concurrence with creaturely
action into two types, physical and moral (see Schmaltz 2014,
148&ndash;150; Rateau 2019, 241&ndash;5). Physical concurrence is
God&rsquo;s active, unmediated, and specific contribution to every
creaturely action. This type of concurrence <em>is sufficient to
produce every effect, including sins</em> and yet <em>only extends to
the good or perfect</em>. Physical concurrence has both features
because God&rsquo;s consequent will is sufficient to produce every
effect and yet derives its entire force and intentionality from the
antecedent wills, which respond directly and exclusively to the good
(CD, 26&ndash;27). In a sense, God can be fully involved with the best
possible world, evils and all, by decisively carrying through every
desire for the good that composes God&rsquo;s consequent will. As
Leibniz wrote, &ldquo;[&hellip;] when it is said that the creature
depends upon God in so far as it exists and in so far as it acts, and
even that conservation is a continual creation, this is true in that
God gives ever to the creature and produces continually all that in it
is positive, good and perfect, every perfect gift coming from the
Father of lights&rdquo; (H, 145; see also CD, 9; Rateau 2019, 242).
God physically concurs with every action &ldquo;in so far as these
actions have some degree of perfection&rdquo;&mdash;but there is no
reality to an action apart from its perfection.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, God knows that some of these actions are sins, because
God &ldquo;acts with perfect freedom and does nothing without a
complete knowledge of the thing and the consequences that it may
have&rdquo; (H, 127). God may recognize a privation in some effect
arising from disharmony among antecedent wills. When rational beings
are involved, the deprived effect may be depraved, and God recognizes
this as sin (CD, 96&ndash;97). If God persists in physical concurrence
anyway (because these antecedent wills are integrated into a
consequent will for the best) then God permits the sin (CD,
26&ndash;28). As Leibniz wrote, &ldquo;the consequent will of God,
which has sin for its object, is only permissive&rdquo; (H, 141). God
acquiesces, extending permission to the sin <em>as a sin</em> while
physically concurring with the very same action <em>in so far as it
has some degree of perfection.</em> This acquiescence or permission is
moral concurrence. Moral concurrence is therefore unique to sin (but
lacks the creative power required to make God the author of sin),
while physical concurrence is unique to perfection (and has the
creative power to make God the author of all good).</p>

<h4 id="DefCauCreCulForSin">3.2.3 Deficient Causation and Creaturely Culpability for Sin</h4>

<p>
As Leibniz acknowledged, moral concurrence is the &ldquo;more
perplexing&rdquo; of the two types of concurrence (H, 142; see
Schmaltz 2014, 136), perhaps because an account of how God merely
<em>permits</em> sin must come with an account of how creatures
<em>commit</em> sin. Here, Leibniz faced two significant pressures. On
the one hand, he needed an account of creaturely agency robust enough
to make creatures morally responsible for their own actions, even
though &ldquo;the decisive act of will, which results from all
inclining acts of will, always produces its full effect, provided the
power is adequate to the will, which it certainly is in the case of
God&rdquo; (CD, 27). On the other hand, Leibniz needed to explain how
any agent could be responsible for a lack or privation, having already
based God&rsquo;s mere <em>permission</em> for sin on the fact that
sin is a lack within some encompassing positive reality that God
creates. As described in
 <a href="#EarWorBef167">Section 2.1</a>,
 Leibniz had already worried that this would make it impossible for
<em>any</em> agent to commit a sin, leaving no one responsible (CP,
23). Creaturely agency must hold its own within God&rsquo;s
overarching providential order but also assume responsibility for mere
privations.</p>

<p>
This entry is not the place for Leibniz&rsquo;s full account of moral
agency. The secondary literature, especially Julia Jorati&rsquo;s
<em>Leibniz on Causation and Agency</em> (2017), contains thoughtful
discussions of the underlying psychology and metaphysics. The core of
the account is the claim that human beings have the capacity to direct
themselves toward goods they perceive as good and in so doing forego
other potential actions: &ldquo;[t]he will is never prompted to action
save by the representation of the good, which prevails over the
opposite representations. [&hellip;] For that very reason the choice
is free and independent of necessity, because it is made between
several possibles, and the will is determined only by the
preponderating goodness of the object&rdquo; (H, 151). Leibniz often
presented this conception of agency in terms of three necessary and
jointly sufficient conditions: spontaneity, intelligence, and
contingency (H, 306; AG, 64)&mdash;or self-determination for a known
end without logical or metaphysical necessitation. This counts as
moral agency, because the end is known <em>as good</em> (CD, 98;
Jorati 2017, 181 &amp; 191&ndash;3; as Jorati notes, Leibniz employed
the concept of moral agency but did not use the term). This model of
human moral agency should be familiar, because we have seen it already
in Leibniz&rsquo;s description of moral necessity and God&rsquo;s
consequent will. Human beings are moral agents in the way God is a
moral agent, though not to the same degree (H, 150; CD, 98; see also
Jorati 2017, 116&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
This model of moral agency does not, on its own, explain why creatures
are morally responsible for what God has willed. Even granting that
God is not the author of sin, God&rsquo;s encompassing and
irresistible consequent will still seems to block human culpability.
Leibniz did struggle at length in the <em>Theodicy</em> with whether
the sinner could really have done otherwise, considering infant
culpability for original sin (H, 172), the moral helplessness of
adolescents (H, 179), and finally our common impotence before the
divine will:</p>

<blockquote>
Let us pass on to those who lack not power to amend, but good will.
They are doubtless not to be excused; but there always remains a great
difficulty concerning God, since it rested with him to give them this
same good will. He is the master of wills, the hearts of kings and
those of all other men are in his hand. Holy Scripture goes so far as
to say that God at times hardened the wicked in order to display his
power by punishing them. (H, 181)
</blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s accounts of contingency (see
 <a href="#LeiMatThe">Section 3</a>)
 offer some insight into how a sin could have been avoided. The
<em>per se</em> possibility account secures the possibility that Judas
not exist, or that someone very similar to Judas but not a traitor
exist instead in a different world (see H, 374&ndash;8). These
alternative possibilities are internally coherent and so <em>per
se</em> possible, but they are outside of Judas&rsquo;s power (because
Judas <em>already</em> exists), and so they are only useful in
establishing God&rsquo;s freedom from metaphysical necessitation.
Turning instead to the infinite analysis account of contingency, it
may be that no contradiction would follow from Judas not sinning,
despite treachery being contained in his complete concept. This is a
more plausible precondition for Judas&rsquo;s own freedom, especially
if treachery is contained in his complete concept only because the
same complete concept also includes the faulty perception that a
treacherous action would be better than any alternative. This was
Leibniz&rsquo;s settled view in the <em>Theodicy</em>, where he stated
that all is &ldquo;certain and determined beforehand in man, as
everywhere else, and the human soul is a kind of <em>spiritual
automaton</em>&rdquo; driven not by divine decrees, but internally, by
a progressive unfolding of perceptions and appetites, some of which
rise to the level of morally free actions. Crucially, this spiritual
automaton is what God grasps as a mere possibility, wills with
antecedent will, and then integrates into a consequent will,
&ldquo;the all-powerful word <em>Fiat</em>.&rdquo; As Leibniz
concluded, &ldquo;that which is contingent and free remains no less so
under the decrees of God than under his prevision&rdquo; (H,
154&ndash;5). God&rsquo;s consequent will is then orthogonal to the
human will, creating the entire mechanism of human moral agency at
once.</p>

<p>
Having argued that human moral agency is compatible with God&rsquo;s
ineluctable consequent will, Leibniz&rsquo;s remaining task was to
show how human beings could be morally responsible for the lack or
privation that makes an action sinful. The difficulty was that this
privative quality played a crucial role in explaining why God <em>is
not</em> responsible for evil: God effects what is real but merely
permits what is lacking (see
 <a href="#ConDivPerForSin">Section 3.2.2</a>).
 How can human moral agents be responsible for a lack, if God
cannot?</p>

<p>
To address this, Leibniz introduced the concept of a
<em>deficient</em> cause (see Schmalz 2014, 149&ndash;152; Jorati
2017, 98&ndash;108; Rateau 2019, 117&ndash;9 &amp; 265&ndash;270). As
he explained, &ldquo;the formal character of evil has no
<em>efficient</em> cause, for it consists in privation [&hellip;], in
that which the efficient cause does not bring about. That is why the
Schoolmen are wont to call the cause of evil <em>deficient</em>&rdquo;
(H, 139). To illustrate this concept, Leibniz offered examples of
deficient causes: the river carries a heavy barge more slowly (H, 386)
and &ldquo;water in freezing is capable of breaking a gun-barrel
wherein it is confined; and yet cold is a certain privation of
force&rdquo; (H, 222&ndash;3). As Leibniz understood the second
example, the withdrawal of heat allows another force to act more
powerfully than it would have otherwise. It is &ldquo;by
accident&rdquo; that this privation has a positive effect. Similarly,
ignorance, error, malice, and ill will &ldquo;consist formally in a
certain kind of privation&rdquo; and have their effects accidentally.
For instance, ignorance might allow inadequate evidence to carry
disproportionate weight, and malice might allow a baser passion to
dominate (H, 145). These deficient causes of sin are privations in
human moral agency and so depend on the &ldquo;previous limitations
that are originally in the creature&rdquo; (H, 356), which Leibniz had
identified as metaphysical evil (see
 <a href="#BesAllPosWor">Section 3.1</a>).
 Human moral agents are responsible or culpable for a lack because
they become its deficient cause.</p>

<p>
There is still an explanatory gap between metaphysical evil and moral
evils like malice. Could there have been inherently limited moral
agents that nevertheless did not become the deficient causes of sin?
Filling this gap would involve Leibniz&rsquo;s treatment of original
sin and grace, topics he did address at length in the
<em>Theodicy</em> (H, 172&ndash;185; see also Rutherford 2014,
78&ndash;86). The crucial point here is that finite moral agents, due
to their inherent limitations, are disposed to be limited in ways that
matter morally, and so to become deficient causes of sin. God permits
sin just by knowingly extending physical concurrence to these morally
compromised agents, because of their contribution to the best possible
world. Therefore, despite God&rsquo;s encompassing providence,
creaturely culpability for sin remains intact, grounded in the
creature as an inherently deficient cause.</p>

<p>
According to Leibniz&rsquo;s mature theodicy, God wills every good and
nothing evil (antecedently). These wills cannot all be realized, and
the best that can be realized contains some contrasts and compromises
among antecedent wills. God wills this (consequently) and so creates
the best of all possible worlds, which is our world. God constantly
maintains this world in being, concurring (physically) with every
perfection that makes it real. Nevertheless, the contrasts and
compromises among finite things give rise to local privations, or
(metaphysical) evils. Some of these are sufferings, or (physical)
evils. God is aware of physical evils and wills them only for the sake
of a greater good. Some finite beings are like God, created with moral
agency, or the ability to determine themselves knowingly for the
greatest perceived good. Their inherent lack makes them liable to
exercise agency with destructive deficiency. When they do, this is sin
or (moral) evil. God knows and physically concurs anyway, without
willing the sin as a sin. This is God&rsquo;s moral concurrence, and
why creatures, rather than God, are the authors of sin.</p>

<h3 id="MeaSuf">3.3 The Meaning of Suffering</h3>

<p>
As argued in
 <a href="#HowLeiUndProEvi">Section 1</a>,
 Leibniz believed that God&rsquo;s worthiness could be inferred from
creation. We should love and praise God for God&rsquo;s intrinsic
goodness, but this goodness is conveyed abundantly in creation. Evil
presented a problem for this view. If God deserves praise <em>for the
good</em>, why not criticism <em>for the evil</em>? The theodicean
project aimed to break this apparent symmetry between good and evil.
This entry details how Leibniz found fundamental asymmetries,
beginning with the distinction between perfection and privation,
extending to the distinction between an optimal whole and its
deficient parts, and concluding with the distinction between
continuous creation and mere permission.</p>

<p>
These asymmetries constitute a metaphysical answer to the original
problem but not yet a pastoral answer, and a pastoral answer was
needed because Leibniz believed that the theodicean project had
personal and political import. Individuals and whole societies could
be distressed by moral evils, and by the apparently unjust
distribution of physical evils (H, 100; see Rateau 2019, 1&ndash;3).
Inadequate or false responses to evil encourage further evils (H,
55&ndash;62) and give rise to warring sects (CP, 6&ndash;7). As
Leibniz wrote, these are &ldquo;hard knots, which no sword of
Alexander can loosen&rdquo; and &ldquo;the stumbling block for the
happiness of so many; this is the point of doubt that has brought so
many either to despair or wickedness, which until now has never been
resolved, as so many poor souls needed it to be&rdquo; (CP, 21).</p>

<p>
It was an important test of his answer, then, whether it could console
the suffering and unite the divided. This explains, in part, why the
<em>Theodicy</em> was &ldquo;the most voluminous and intentionally
popular philosophical work which Leibniz ever published&rdquo;
(Antognazza 2009, 479&ndash;480) and why he had concentrated on its
themes for so many decades. It also explains the consoling passages
distributed throughout the work, such as the following: &ldquo;one
often suffers through the evil actions of others; but when one has no
part in the offence one must look upon it as a certainty that these
sufferings prepare for us a greater happiness&rdquo; (H, 279) and
&ldquo;not only pains and effort but also prayers are effective, God
having had even these prayers in mind before he ordered things, and
having made due allowance for them&rdquo; (H, 384). The first passage
reassures the reader that God&rsquo;s providence accounts for human
beings and their sufferings, and by extension, that the best world is
also just. Since that justice is still hidden (see
 <a href="#BesAllPosWor">Section 3.1</a>),
 God&rsquo;s providence provides a basis for hope. The second passage
suggests that this hope can be agential, a ground for action, because
God has ordered the world to make our pain, effort, and prayer have
good effects.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Theodicy</em> and in earlier works, Leibniz developed these
consolations into an ethics of temporal orientation (see Mercer 2012).
Toward the past Leibniz counseled a grateful acquiescence not unlike
God&rsquo;s moral concurrence: &ldquo;it is not sufficient to force
ourselves to be patient; rather, we must truly be satisfied with
everything that has come to us according to his will&rdquo; (AG, 37).
Even horrible things are to be accepted gratefully, because
&ldquo;afflictions, especially those the good have, only lead to their
greater good&rdquo; (AG, 154). Toward the future, we &ldquo;must not
be quietists and stand ridiculously with arms folded, awaiting that
which God will do [&hellip;] but we must act in accordance with what
we presume to be the will of God [&hellip;] trying with all our might
to contribute to the general good [&hellip;]&rdquo; (AG, 37). As
above, we have actual moral agency and work for a &ldquo;good
master&rdquo; (H, 57) who takes our efforts into account.</p>

<p>
Through his <em>Theodicy</em>, Leibniz offered hope that past
sufferings will still bear fruit, and freedom to strive for the good
without concern for results, knowing that whatever happens will be for
the best. As Leibniz wrote, &ldquo;these considerations must be held
to be not only pleasing and consoling, but most true. I think that in
the universe nothing is truer than happiness, nor is anything happier
or sweeter than truth&rdquo; (AG, 154).</p>
