<h1>Personal Identity and Ethics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jun 30, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
We think of ourselves as temporally extended beings. We do not just
exist in the moment. Most of us have been around for a few years and
will, hopefully, continue to exist in the future. We also believe that
we are individuals whose psychology and bodies are distinct from
others. For example, our own thoughts and feelings can of course be
communicated to others, but in some special way they seem to be ours.
These views&mdash;our temporally extended existence and our
distinctness from other individuals&mdash;have given rise to a number
of ethical debates.</p>

<p>
For instance, if someone committed a terrible crime in the past, but
then went through decades of inner reform, are they still deserving of
blame and punishment to the same degree as shortly after the crime?
Other debates concern the beginning and the end of our existence.
Imagine someone issues a directive according to which she does not
want further life-extending medical treatments in certain possible
scenarios at the end of life. Then, years later, she forgets about the
directive due to dementia. Are the relatives and physicians still
supposed to respect the directive?</p>

<p>
The fact that we think of ourselves as temporally extended individuals
that are distinct from others can also raise other questions. We
usually care about our own future well-being in a special way. But
does this really make as much sense for the very distant future as for
the more immediate one? And what does this imply in the realm of
morality? Am I really justified in having a special concern for one
future person over all others? The extent to which the future
well-being of others should matter, if it competes with my own
interests, seems to have implications for equality considerations and
distributive justice.</p>

<p>
For these and other ethical questions, it looks like any answer we
come up with will have to make essential reference to personal
identity. As this entry will show, there are different accounts of
what matters in terms of our persistence through time as individual
entities, and these accounts can support competing answers to such
ethical questions.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="PerIde">1. Personal Identity</h2>

<p>
What is meant by &lsquo;identity&rsquo;, in the sense the term is used
in this entry, is our persistence through time (see the entry on
 <a href="../identity-personal/">personal identity</a>).
 In other words, it is the numerical sameness of an individual at
different points in time.</p>

<p>
Numerical identity is not the same as qualitative identity. Identical
twins may be qualitatively similar, but they are nonetheless
numerically distinct. They are numerically distinct, because they are
two distinct individuals that persist through time independently from
each other.</p>

<p>
The term &lsquo;identity&rsquo; in this numerical sense is also to be
distinguished from our identity in the social or political sense of
the term. While numerical identity refers only to our persistence
through time, our identity in the social or political sense can also
include national or ethnic affiliations, racialized properties, gender
aspects and sexual orientation, or certain characteristic beliefs,
commitments, values, attitudes and experiences with respect to how
they determine our place in a society. The focus of this entry is on
our identity in the numerical sense of the term.</p>

<h2 id="PsyVie">2. The Psychological View</h2>

<p>
Two of the most common accounts of our identity are the psychological
and the biological accounts. The modern psychological criterion of
personal identity is often traced back to John Locke (Locke 1694
[1975], see the entry
 <a href="../locke-personal-identity/">Locke on Personal Identity</a>).
 In its contemporary form (S. Shoemaker 1970, 1984; Parfit 1973,
1986), it says that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
person <em>X</em> at time<sub>1</sub> and person <em>Y</em> at
time<sub>2</sub> are the same person if and only if <em>X</em> is
uniquely psychologically continuous with <em>Y</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What is usually meant by psychological continuity is a chain of strong
psychological connections (Parfit 1984: 207). These can include
recollections of the past, intentions for the future, but also beliefs
or desires (Parfit 1984: 205), and perhaps even attitudes and
character traits. All of these forms of mental content can persist
through time, and the later states causally depend on the earlier
ones. The reason for the requirement of unique psychological
continuity is to exclude a notorious thought experiment describing
&ldquo;split brain&rdquo; cases (see the next section) in which
someone&rsquo;s psychology branches and continues in two separate
strands. Since numerical identity cannot apply to two separate things,
this possibility must be excluded.</p>

<p>
The meaning of &lsquo;continuity&rsquo; and
&lsquo;connectedness&rsquo; can be illustrated by appeal to an example
from Thomas Reid (Reid 1785 [1975: 114]). In this example, a brave
officer remembers stealing fruit from an orchard when he was a child.
Later, as an old general, he remembers stealing a standard from the
enemy, but he does not recall stealing fruit as a child. In this
example, the general has direct memory connections with the brave
officer, and the brave officer has direct memory connections with the
child, but there is no such connection between the general and the
child. If one wants to maintain that the child and the general are
identical, one needs to appeal to a transitive notion over and above
connectedness: Continuity is defined as a an overlapping chain of
direct connections and will therefore extent all the way from the
child to the general.</p>

<p>
As already mentioned, there may be other direct psychological
connections apart from memories. And overall, the extent to which such
direct connections obtain may be a matter of degree. The continuity
relation, however, must be understood as an all-or-nothing relation.
Otherwise, it cannot serve as a criterion that determines conclusively
whether an individual has persisted or not.</p>

<p>
Some conclude that when it comes to the relationship between personal
identity and ethics, what matters is our numerical identity as
psychological entities&mdash;in other words, our persistence as a
single psychologically continuous individual.</p>

<h2 id="IdeDoeMatVie">3. The Identity Doesn&rsquo;t Matter View</h2>

<p>
The view that our numerical identity matters for ethical purposes has
been subject to an important challenge. The challenge is based on the
above mentioned thought experiment about psychological branching or
fission. It can be used to argue that it is not identity <em>as
such</em> that matters for practical purposes.</p>

<p>
The experiment can run as follows: Suppose that my two triplet sisters
have gotten into a terrible accident and have suffered irreversible
brain damage. Assume that both of my brain hemispheres are functional
duplicates of each other. A crazy brain surgeon transplants one half
of my brain into each of my sisters&rsquo; heads, and then, after the
operation, both of them are fully psychologically continuous with me
(Parfit 1984:254f). </p>

<p>
What happens in this thought experiment in terms of personal identity?
Both of my two surviving siblings are psychologically continuous with
me. However, the notion of numerical identity prohibits the
possibility that two separate individuals can be identical with a
single past individual, making it impossible that both of them are me.
Stipulating that only one of them is identical to me would seem
arbitrary, which leaves us with the claim that neither of them is
identical with me, even though both of them are psychologically
continuous with me.</p>

<p>
However, since both of them are psychologically continuous with me, I
care about their future as if it were mine. For example, if they would
have to undergo painful tooth operations right after the branching, I
should be as concerned as if that prospect were mine. There is a form
of special prudential concern that usually only applies in regard to
my own future. One may also call it egoistic concern. Usually, I care
about my own future in a special way because it is mine and because
this gives me a particular reason to be concerned that does not apply
in regard to the future of any other person. Since this kind of
special concern also seems to be plausible in regard to the
individuals after my branching, this ultimately implies that what
matters for prudential concern&mdash;and arguably also for moral
questions&mdash;is psychological continuity, not our persistence as
one individual, or numerical identity as such.</p>

<p>
The thought experiment has shown that personal identity and
psychological continuity can in principle come apart. Furthermore, as
illustrated above, psychological continuity can itself be further
reduced to the strong psychological connections of which it is
supposed to consist (see the previous section). This means that so far
we can distinguish the following psychological accounts of what
matters: It can be argued that what matters is (a) our numerical
identity as psychological beings; (b) psychological continuity; or (c)
psychological connectedness. Finally, it can also be argued that (d)
both psychological continuity and connectedness matter (Parfit 1984:
215, 313). The latter view implies that continuity is sufficient for
special prudential concern, but that gradually more concern is
justified if there is also a certain degree of connectedness.</p>

<h2 id="BioVie">4. The Biological View</h2>

<p>
The main competition for the psychological account of our identity is
the biological view (Olson 1997; DeGrazia 2005). According to the
biological account of our identity,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
person <em>X</em> existing at time<sub>1</sub> is identical to an
entity <em>Y</em> existing at any other time if and only if there is
biological continuity between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By &ldquo;biological continuity between <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>&rdquo; it is usually meant that they share the same
biological life, or that those parts of the brain or body that are
responsible for the continued life-sustaining functions of the
organism have not been subject to abrupt radical change. Note that
&ldquo;entity <em>Y</em>&rdquo; may or may not be a person, which
allows that &ldquo;person <em>X</em>&rdquo; may be one and the same as
an early fetus or a patient in a persistent vegetative state.</p>

<p>
This biological criterion of our identity implies that we are
essentially human organisms (Olson 1997: 70ff; 2007; Johansson 2016),
with or without psychology&mdash;a view that is sometimes referred to
as animalism. Early fetuses or patients in persistent vegetative
states can belong to the same biological life, but do not have the
kinds of psychological properties that we usually attribute to a
person. Defenders of animalism acknowledge that human organisms
usually have psychological states during some parts of their
existence, and that these psychological states can be decisive for
ethical purposes. At other times of their existence, though, human
beings sometimes lack such psychological states.</p>

<p>
This acknowledgement prevents certain objections against the view. For
example, proponents of the biological view usually say that
responsibility ascriptions, which form the foundation of blame and
punishment, depend on the presence of psychological states. They can
therefore not automatically be accused of certain counter-intuitive
positions, such as perhaps that we should punish patients in
persistent vegetative states for their past crimes in some way.</p>

<p>
A main challenge to the biological account is based on a thought
experiment in which part of a brain gets transplanted. Suppose that
our cerebrum supports merely our psychology, while the brainstem
organizes the life sustaining functions of the organism. Imagine my
cerebrum is transplanted into a different living organism and the
resulting person turns out to be exactly like me psychologically.
Imagine also that my cerebrum-less organism is kept alive (Olson 1997:
43&ndash;51; DeGrazia 2005: 51&ndash;54). Most people share the
intuition that the recipient of my cerebrum would be me simply because
he would have my psychology (even if not the same life sustaining
functions), and survival of my psychology seems to be what practically
matters.</p>

<p>
Advocates of the biological view can argue that this challenge is
irrelevant in everyday cases (DeGrazia 2005: 60f). They can also argue
that a particularly important feature of the biological account is
that the relation which determines whether we persist, and the
relations that matter for ethical purposes, can come apart. The
biological account of our identity focuses on what preserves our
identity, while other relations, such as our psychological continuity,
may be what matters for ethical or normative purposes, say our
self-concern (Olson 1997: 70; 2022).</p>

<h2 id="PruCon">5. Prudential Concern</h2>

<p>
One central practical issue is our special prudential self-concern for
the future, which&mdash;as indicated above&mdash;one may also call
egoistic concern. There abound philosophical thought experiments to
help with an analysis (e.g., Parfit 1984: 200ff and 229ff; for a
critical discussion of thought experiments see Wilkes 1988). Most of
these hypothetical cases describe a future being who has lost some,
but not all of the diachronic relations that usually obtain. With this
method, they seek to determine which relation it is that matters for
special prudential concern. One example is the case of branching
discussed above, in which the two resulting beings cannot be identical
with the original one&mdash;a scenario that can be combined with the
question whether we should be afraid of any severe pain that the two
resulting beings might experience. The upshot of these hypothetical
scenarios is not the <em>empirical</em> question of which relations
must hold for people to <em>actually</em> develop special prudential
concern for a future self. Rather, they are supposed to answer the
<em>normative</em> question under which conditions one <em>should</em>
care about a future self in this special way.</p>

<p>
Some challenging cases are not at all hypothetical. For example, the
real-life occurrence of dementia can raise the question whether a
complete loss of psychological connectedness and continuity (complete
memory failure) results in a different person. In practical respects,
one may ask whether it is plausible to have special prudential concern
for such a potential future entity. Should one set aside money, for
example, to make the life of this future being more comfortable? The
answer seems to depend on which of the mentioned diachronic relations
matters here (Buchanan &amp; Brock 1990: ch. 3; McMahan 2002: ch. 5.3;
DeGrazia 2005: ch. 5).</p>

<p>
Jeff McMahan wants to say that a late-stage dementia patient is the
identical person as the previous healthy adult. In order to be able to
hold this view, he argues that memory connections and continuity are
not necessary, and that a continuous flow of merely momentary
consciousness (along with continuity of certain parts of the brain) is
sufficient for identity. This is a further variant of a psychological
view (in combination with a physical element). However, an identity
criterion does not necessarily answer the question of whether one
ought to have special prudential concern for a later dementia patient.
Given the severe loss of psychological connectedness, though, McMahan
argues that it would be rational to be somewhat less concerned in a
special prudential way about this future being. At the same time, he
also insists that the presence of continuous momentary consciousness
(along with continuity of certain parts of the brain) still warrants
some significant concern (McMahan 2002: 495f).</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s now take a more detailed look at the claim that
psychological continuity and/or connectedness has practical import.
Most notably, this has been defended by Derek Parfit (1984: 215, 313).
But he left open how much relative weight continuity and connectedness
should have.</p>

<p>
Giving a lot (or even exclusive) weight to psychological connectedness
would have some rather interesting consequences. If continuity is
irrelevant, a single life would practically have to be viewed as a
succession of overlapping multiple selves. It would make little sense
to be prudentially concerned in a special way for very distant future
selves. Moreover, since psychological connections are a matter of
degree, there would also have to be a discount rate for special
prudential concern. As a consequence, it would even make somewhat less
sense to care about future selves in the mid-term future. Overall,
this could sometimes imply that the ground for special prudential
concern will not be much greater than our ground to be concerned about
the future of other people. For example, that future dementia patient
with my name might not warrant much more of my special concern than
any other future person out there.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s next take a look at the impact of psychological
continuity. Defenders of this view can point to the sometimes
counter-intuitive consequences that would arise if one were to give a
lot or even exclusive weight to connectedness. In particular,
psychological continuity might do a better job at accounting for the
value of personal development or character change (Merricks 2022: ch.
4). Such changes reduce the connections with our past, but since they
are often intentional forms of self-development, it might be
inappropriate to insist that they generally reduce the foundation for
special prudential concern.</p>

<p>
The view that both continuity and connectedness matter is an
interesting compromise. It would be able to account for self-concern
in cases of significant personal change (due to the continuity
component), but would also mean that this concern should be somewhat
reduced (due to the loss of connectedness).</p>

<p>
Next, there is the view that what matters is our psychological
numerical identity <em>as such</em>, over and above psychological
continuity and/or connectedness. As demonstrated above, identity is a
relation that comes with a prohibition against division, while
psychological continuity and connectedness can in principle continue
in two separate strands. Defenders of the view that what matters is
our identity as psychological beings can argue that our unique
persistence is important for our self concern. We might care about our
uniqueness when it comes to ensuring certain external privileges for
ourselves, for example owning a house all by ourselves, instead of
having to share it, or being somebody&rsquo;s one and only marriage
partner, or being the only one who won the national championships last
year. Arguably, the value of having these social accomplishments in
our lives partly depends on there being only one person who has them
(e.g., Johnston 1992: 608ff; 1997: 168ff; Wolf 1986: 715; Unger 1990:
275ff).</p>

<p>
Finally, proponents of a biological account of our numerical identity
tend to agree that psychological continuity and/or connectedness
matter more for ethical or normative purposes. However, when it comes
to certain issues at the end of life, the question of whether our
persistence as a biological organism has come to an end does sometimes
appear relevant to people. For example, some people are concerned
that, if they should ever end up in hospital due to a potentially
deadly accident, physicians might take organs for transplantation from
them at a point in time when their existence as a living organism has
not yet come to an end.</p>

<h2 id="Res">6. Responsibility</h2>

<p>
There is a debate on whether our psychological identity, or rather
certain other psychological relations, determine which past actions a
person can be morally responsible for. Moral responsibility for an
action is usually seen as a precondition for praise or blame. It is
also taken to be a precondition for punishments or for owing
compensation.</p>

<p>
John Locke famously argues that personal identity is closely related
to moral responsibility (Locke 1694 [1975: 49ff, 39f], see the entry
 <a href="../locke-personal-identity/">Locke on Personal Identity</a>).
 This view is reflects the widely held assumption that one can only be
directly responsible for one&rsquo;s own actions, but not for those of
other people (Schechtman 1996: 14; Olson 1997: 59). According to this
view, responsibility presupposes personal identity (Butler 1736 [1975:
99&ndash;105]; Reid 1785 [1975: 107&ndash;118]; Glannon 1998:
235ff).</p>

<p>
Others argue that what matters for responsibility is merely some form
of psychological continuity or connectedness with the past agent (with
or without identity). One element of psychological connectedness is
memory. Some passages in Locke suggest a memory criterion according to
which remembering an event might be necessary for being responsible
for it (esp. Locke 1694 [1975: esp. 49, and 46f]). However, it is
usually claimed that direct memories are not necessary. For example,
one can argue that amnesia, e.g., due to drunkenness, trauma or
repression, should not prevent responsibility attributions (e.g.,
Glannon 2019: ch. 6). If one accepts this, then continuity of memory,
rather than direct memory connections would be a more plausible
foundation for responsibility.</p>

<p>
If what matters involves in part psychological connectedness (as
opposed to merely continuity), further issues regarding responsibility
can arise. As Parfit argues, connections include not only memories,
but also intentions, beliefs, or desires, and they can be a matter of
degree. As a result, responsibility may decline in corresponding
degrees whenever these psychological connections between an individual
now and when he or she performed a past action are weaker (Parfit
1984: 325f).</p>

<p>
To some extent, weakening psychological connections are a common
feature of everyone&rsquo;s life. If the extent is moderate, then
continuity might nonetheless be preserved. In these kinds of cases, we
have to answer the question whether it is the loss of connectedness
that matters, or the preserved continuity, since these two positions
would have different implications. An interesting illustration,
introduced by Parfit, is the case of a Russian nobleman who will
inherit vast estates in the future. He intends to give the land to the
peasants. However, since he anticipates losing his socialist ideals
over the years, he signs a respective legal document that can only be
revoked with the consent of his wife, and makes her promise to remain
committed to his younger socialist self. Many years later, when he
does in fact lose his ideals, his wife wonders whether she is still
bound by her promise (and whether she will be blameworthy or
praiseworthy if she ignores it). If psychological continuity is
relevant here, she would still have to be seen as bound by her
commitment. If connectedness is relevant, she might not be. A further
alternative would be to argue that both relations matter, so that one
could argue that her moral duty to keep the promise has been
preserved, but to a somewhat reduced degree (Parfit 1984: 325f).</p>

<p>
A severe weakening of both continuity and connectedness seems to be
characteristic of dementia cases. This raises the question of whether
dementia patients can still be seen as morally responsible (and
blameworthy or even punishable) for actions they committed when
healthy and competent. A complete loss of these psychological
relations might have to result in a loss of responsibility, even if
the patient in question has committed murder or genocide in the past.
In order to prevent this conclusion, one could perhaps turn to the
view that a continuous flow of merely momentary consciousness (McMahan
2002: 495f) is sufficient for responsibility attributions.</p>

<p>
The analysis of these questions can also benefit from a
differentiation in the notion of responsibility. Moral responsibility
in the strong sense of <em>accountability</em> can be understood as
requiring a general ability to understand what one has done to another
person. This involves not only a grasp of the moral demands in social
settings, but also the ability to identify with the past agent who has
violated or respected these demands (Wolf 1986; Watson 1996). It has
been argued that those with severe dementia can generally not be held
accountable for their past actions anymore, even though one can, under
certain conditions, still <em>attribute</em> certain actions or
attitudes to them (D. Shoemaker 2012, 2015: 205ff). Moral
responsibility in the weaker sense of <em>attributability</em> merely
requires the possibility of a fitting ascription of certain attitudes
to a person.</p>

<p>
Similarly, the question whether punishments are still plausible in
cases of crimes that were committed a very long time ago (Douglas
2019), perhaps even by people who have developed severe dementia since
then, may depend in part on the meaning, purpose and justification of
punishments. For example, if one takes legal punishment to be a social
symbol of reprobation that is directed at society at large, then
punishing the demented might still make some sense, since their
understanding of the symbolic message would not be required (Hallich
2021). If it is viewed as a communicative symbol that is (also)
directed at the perpetrator, however, then punishing the demented may
be a pointless endeavour (Dufner 2013).</p>

<h2 id="WhaMatBegOurExi">7. What Matters at the Beginning of Our Existence</h2>

<p>
Claims about what matters have also played a role in debates about the
beginning and the end of our existence. A prominent debate about the
beginning of our existence concern the permissibility of abortion.
Some arguments that prohibit the destruction of human embryos or
fetuses concern the moral <em>status they have</em> <em>then</em>,
irrespective of what they will later develop into. Such arguments
often say that they are biological life forms that belong to the human
species and are therefore worthy of special protection. Other
arguments concern the <em>diachronic</em> <em>relationship</em>
between these early life forms and later, born children and adults.
These arguments claim that there is a morally relevant diachronic
relationship between these early life forms and the later beings they
may become, and these diachronic relations bear on the topic of this
entry.</p>

<p>
An influential argument against abortion is given by Don Marquis
(1989). He believes that the primary reason why we may not kill
ordinary people is that it deprives them of a valuable future. The
victims would lose all the activities, projects, experiences and
enjoyments that would have constituted their future. More
specifically, it would deprive them of a future they value
<em>now</em>, or would have valued <em>at a later time</em> (Marquis
1989: 189f). Marquis argues that it is wrong to kill a being with a
valuable future like ours; a fetus has a valuable future like ours;
and it is therefore wrong to kill a fetus. Marquis&rsquo;s
future-like-ours-argument has a diachronic component. It presupposes
that each of us was once a fetus, so numerical identity is what
matters for the permissibility of abortion (Marquis 1989: 192; McMahan
2002: 271; Heathwood 2011: 230). It thus presupposes that biological
identity matters. At the same time, though, it seems to presuppose a
psychological view of what gives life its value.</p>

<p>
A criticism of Marquis&rsquo;s argument may be to argue that a fetus
does not, in fact, have a valuable future like ours. What makes
<em>our</em> future valuable to us is that it stands in a particular
kind of relationship to <em>us now</em>. More precisely, our future
<em>psychological</em> life stands in a particular relationship to our
present <em>psychological</em> life. A fetus does not have the kind of
future-directed <em>psychological</em> life we do, and we do not have
a backward-directed <em>psychological</em> relation to the fetus, so
taking away a fetus&rsquo;s future is different from taking away our
future (for early discussions of this kind, see McInerney 1990; Brown
2002; Brill 2003).</p>

<p>
This criticism implies that having a valuable future like ours
requires some sort of psychological continuity between a fetus and a
later person (D. Shoemaker 2009: 133). Since this point could apply
irrespective of whether we are numerically identical with fetuses or
not, it also supports the further claim that our identity is
irrelevant to the ethics of abortion (Conee 1999, D. Shoemaker 2010,
on resistance to this point see Chappell 2000 or Heathwood 2011). What
matters instead, according to this view, is psychological continuity
or perhaps the specific degree of psychological connectedness between
a fetus and the person it may become (Parfit 1984: 206, 322).</p>

<p>
Overall, one can say that biological views of what matters offer
stronger support to a prohibition of abortion than psychological ones.
This does not mean that proponents of a biological account of our
persistence through time are forced to endorse a prohibition&mdash;at
least not, as long as they acknowledge that the answer to the
normative questions may depend on the presence of psychological,
rather than biological relations.</p>

<h2 id="WhaMatEndOurExi">8. What Matters at the End of Our Existence</h2>

<p>
<strong>Death.</strong> It has long been thought that death is the end
of our existence (as worldly entities). According to this
understanding, death means that there is no longer any being who is
numerically identical to the one there once was (Kagan 2012: ch.
6).</p>

<p>
Traditionally, death was understood as the permanent loss of
cardiopulmonary functioning, and it was assumed that the end of
ordinary psychological functioning would coincide with that. However,
medical progress has led to developments that make it possible for
human beings to spend years in conditions that question this
assumption, for example persistent vegetative states. This has
contributed to the development of the contemporary brain death
criterion (Ad Hoc Committee 1968, President&rsquo;s Commission 1981,
for criticism see e.g., Shewmon 2001). This criterion regulates, for
example, whether we may take organs for transplantations out of a
body.</p>

<p>
The brain death criterion in our current regulatory and legislative
practice requires the death of the <em>whole brain</em> and marks not
only the end of consciousness, but also the end of the brain&rsquo;s
capacity to organize the central life-sustaining functions of the
organism. One can argue that this view is supposed to take broad
account of psychological and biological accounts of our identity and
what matters. The death of the cerebrum means that all consciousness
has irrevocably come to an end, and the death of the brainstem means
that the central life-sustaining functions of the organism have been
irrevocably lost.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers have defended a <em>higher-brain</em> <em>death</em>
criterion, according to which a person is dead once his or her brain
is no longer able to support consciousness (Veatch 1975; Engelhardt
1975; Green &amp; Wikler 1980; Gervais 1986; Zaner 1988; McMahan 2002:
426ff). This view assumes a psychological account of our identity. It
implies that someone in a persistent vegetative state is
dead&mdash;despite the fact that his or her organism is still
functioning independently. Though this view has never made it into
regulatory and legislative practice, some of its proponents (e.g.,
Veatch 2019) have argued that it should be possible for patients to be
exempt from the default standard of death and be given a personal
choice in what counts as their death (e.g., DeGrazia 2005: 157f or
Sass 1992 who identifies room for this in advance directives).</p>

<p>
Arguably, what is relevant for issues at the end of life is not
whether someone&rsquo;s identity has been preserved. Our identity and
what matters for our regulatory and legal practices in regard to our
death may come apart (for further discussion see DeGrazia 2003,
McMahan 1995, 2002). For example, it can be argued that our death
depends on biological identity, while what matters for whether our
organs may be taken out, depends on whether our organism&rsquo;s
consciousness has been irrevocably lost.</p>

<p>
<strong>Advance directives.</strong> In the context of issues at the
end of life, there is also a prominent debate about the binding force
of medical advance directives in case one later develops dementia.
This issue is particularly pressing if the advance directive prohibits
life-saving treatments. Imagine that Margo writes a formal advance
directive when she is still fully competent. In this document she
states that if she develops severe dementia she wishes no life-saving
treatments against conditions such as pneumonia. She wants the
physicians to let her die in such a case. (Palliative treatments that
relieve symptoms during the dying process are compatible with such
directives, but not curative treatments that may prolong her life.)
Later, when she develops such a condition, Margo&rsquo;s caretakers
are unsure what to do, since she appears perfectly happy with her
daily life (Dworkin 1993: 220f, 226, see also McMahan 2002: 497).</p>

<p>
Under normal circumstances, patients can revise their wishes about
prospective medical treatments at any time. This means that their
later will usually trumps any earlier expressions of their will. For
example, someone might sign up for a tooth operation that is supposed
to take place next week, but changes his mind before the operation. In
such a case, it is the later, or most recent wish of the patient that
physicians must respect. In fact, the opposite rule would appear
abhorrent. It would amount to forced treatment. Arguably, though,
cognitively impaired dementia patients cannot change their minds about
such directives.</p>

<p>
One may wonder whether dementia patients are identical to the healthy
adults that existed in the past. However, most people seem to believe
that dementia patients are identical to those healthy
individuals&mdash;irrespective of the severe psychological changes
they have gone through. This view can be accounted for either by
dropping the psychological account of our identity in favour of a
biological one, or by lowering the &ldquo;psychological
threshold&rdquo; for persistence (Buchanan &amp; Brock 1990: ch. 3;
McMahan 2002: 69, 499). The latter option means that one has to accept
the comparatively weak psychological relations that demented Margo
still shares with the earlier adult as identity-preserving. The
advance directive we are discussing would thus be <em>demented
Margo&rsquo;s</em> advance directive, that she issued for herself. In
that case it is more plausible to argue that it should be respected.
However, not a lot of people have explicitly argued that it is
identity as such that matters here (for an exception see Dresser
1986).</p>

<p>
One can argue that numerical identity is not decisive for the validity
of an advance directive, and that other aspects are more important.
Many of these arguments go beyond the views that biological
continuity, or psychological continuity and/or connectedness are what
matters. For example, Ronald Dworkin specifies this claim by arguing
that dementia patients cannot form or revise what he calls critical
interests (Dworkin 1993: 201f; McMahan 2002: 69, 499; Sumner 2011: ch.
5). Critical interests are interests that are formed on the basis of
critical judgements and that concern the value of one&rsquo;s life as
a whole, for example interests in personal relationships or
professional achievement. As Dworkin argues, a dementia patient can no
longer revise earlier critical interests, and we should respect the
advance directive.</p>

<p>
Agnieszka Jaworska, however, argues that the advance directive should
not necessarily be respected (Jaworska 1999: 135f). Even though
demented Margo cannot form critical judgements about her life as a
whole anymore (Dworkin 1993: 201f, cf. also McMahan 2002: 69, 499),
Jaworska believes that what matters is her remaining &ldquo;capacity
to value&rdquo; (Jaworska 1999: 109). By this, she means the ability
to achieve well-being and a sense of meaning by appreciating things
that are in accordance with one&rsquo;s values. As the case
description above indicates, demented Margo enjoys her daily
activities, even though they might appear shallow in comparison to the
daily activities of healthier adults. This position leads Jaworska to
the conclusion that demented Margo&rsquo;s present values should not
be dismissed as easily (Jaworska 1999: 135f).</p>

<h2 id="NorEthDisJus">9. Normative Ethics and Distributive Justice</h2>

<p>
There is also a debate on the relevance of personal identity for our
theories in normative ethics. This debate, mostly initiated by Parfit
(1973, 1984, 1986) and Rawls (1971 [1999], 1974), is focused on the
separateness of persons and its impact on various ethical theories.
Typically, participants in this debate claim that facts about the
separateness of persons speak in favour of a particular moral theory,
including theories about distributive justice.</p>

<p>
By the separateness of persons, authors mean their numerical
distinctness. The expression is supposed to emphasize the fact that we
are different individuals with our own different lives to lead. We
usually think of ourselves as fundamentally distinct from others at
any given point in time and also as temporally extended beings. As
indicated in the introduction to this entry, our thoughts and feelings
at any given point in time can of course be communicated to others,
but in some special way they seem to be ours. The same seems to be
true of the diachronic relations in our lives. In a special sense, our
temporally extended memories, beliefs, desires and intentions, for
example, seem to be ours and nobody else&rsquo;s. If one considers the
relations within an individual&rsquo;s life to be substantial and
comparatively strong, then this implies a diachronic form of
separateness from others. In other words, the separateness from others
is the flip-side of the stronger unity within an individual
person&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>
In a well-known passage in <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, Rawls states
that utilitarianism &ldquo;does not take seriously the distinction
between persons&rdquo;, and therefore needs to be rejected (Rawls
1971: 27 [1999: 24f], see also Gauthier 1963: 126, and Nagel 1970:
134&ndash;142). More specifically, the passage says that
utilitarianism ignores the difference between a single person and a
collection of many people. Although it may be rational for individuals
to maximize their own welfare, applying this comparatively
distribution-insensitive principle to entire societies ignores the
separateness of persons. Rawls also seems to believe that this
separateness speaks in favour of his own view (Rawls 1971 [1999: 24f,
167f]), namely a form of contractualist egalitarianism for
people&rsquo;s lives as a whole (for details see the entry on
 <a href="../rawls/">John Rawls</a>).
 Egalitarianism prefers equal chances and/or a more equal
distribution, e.g., in terms of well-being, in a given society to the
maximization of the good that utilitarianism aims for.</p>

<p>
In contrast to Rawls, Parfit argues that the proper way of thinking
about persons, namely his own account of our persistence and of what
matters, makes the separateness of persons less important. Parfit
believes that it is not our identity as such that matters, but merely
psychological continuity and/or connectedness. According to his
argument, identity as a deep metaphysical unity relation is
irrelevant, and the psychological relations between the various
temporal stages of our existence may be much weaker than one might
think. Moreover, the weaker the psychological connections between the
various temporal stages of our own existence are, the more similar
they are to the relations between ourselves and others. If the
separateness between ourselves and our peers is therefore less
pronounced than we usually think, then the way in which benefits and
burdens are distributed between individuals also becomes less
important. This weakens the objection against the utilitarian
principle (e.g., Parfit 1973; 1984: sec. 111&minus;118; 1986).
Distribution would still matter in some ways and to some extent, but
not as much as many egalitarians and Rawls think it does. More
moderate views could take account of it. According to Parfit,
prioritarianism can do the job. Prioritarianism says that additional
benefits for the worse-off are morally worth more than additional
benefits of equal sizes for the better off (e.g., Parfit 1995; Holtug
2010: ch. 7 and 8). This prioritarian view is related, but not
identical with Rawls&rsquo;s so-called Difference Principle according
to which improvements should always be of advantage to the worst-off
group. Rawls&rsquo;s view is geared towards groups rather than
individuals, and it grants absolute rather than merely relative
priority to the worst-off.</p>

<p>
In line with Rawls&rsquo;s view, it has also been argued that regard
for the separateness of persons speaks against aggregation&mdash;which
is a feature of utilitarianism, but (in specified ways) also of other
views. Aggregation means adding up the good of multiple persons and
allowing it to outweigh the good of individuals or smaller groups. For
example, John Taurek famously argues that aggregation implies treating
benefits for a group of people as if they were a single individual
experiencing these benefits (Taurek 1977: 307). In case one could
either rescue an individual person from drowning or, alternatively,
five other people, he subsequently argues that rescuing the greater
number would disregard the individual person&rsquo;s equal claim of
receiving a rescue chance. Tossing a coin appears superior to him,
because this would grant every individual a fair chance (Taurek 1977;
L&uuml;bbe 2008). However, authors with more moderate views about
aggregation also regularly appeal to the separateness of persons in
support of their view. They try to avoid Taurek&rsquo;s position, and
want to limit aggregation only in regard to some scenarios. For
example, if one could either distribute lollipops to millions of
people or, alternatively, rescue a life, proponents of limited
aggregation would usually argue that receiving a lollipop is a trivial
joy, and therefore no number of lollipops should be able to outweigh a
life. At the same time, they would maintain that individually relevant
claims, such as avoiding extremely terrible injuries, should still be
subject to aggregation. These ethicists argue that the separateness of
individuals speaks in favour of limiting aggregation to relevant
claims (e.g., Voorhoeve 2014: 98, 86; Brennan 1995; Steuwer 2021).</p>

<p>
Just like Rawls, Robert Nozick also thinks that the separateness of
persons provides a positive argument in favour of his own
view&mdash;even though he holds positions that are very different from
Rawls&rsquo;s. He argues that the separateness of persons supports a
libertarian constraint against involuntary re-distributions of the
good (Nozick 1974: 29f). He does not only object to re-distributions
in favour of the general good (which utilitarianism would support). He
also objects against re-distributions from the better-off to the
worse-off (which Rawls&rsquo;s Difference Principle requires). In
addition, Nozick also believes that the separateness of persons speaks
in favour of deontological side-constraints. Such constraints limit
what we may do in order to achieve our ends. They prohibit certain
actions even if committing them would prevent a larger number of
further actions of the same kind. For example, Nozick argues that it
would be wrong to actively kill someone, even if this could prevent a
large number of other killings. This prohibition against killing is a
side-constraint on the means that we may employ to reduce the number
of killings (Nozick 1974: 33f).</p>

<p>
Moreover, Sidgwick famously argues that regard for the distinction
between persons can lead to rational egoism. If someone is convinced
that the quality of his or her own existence is of more fundamental
importance for him than experiences of any other individual, then this
person will be led to rational egoism. Such a person will always see
more reason to aim for his or her own welfare rather than the good of
anyone else (Sidgwick 1907: 420, 498). However, Brink argues that some
of the relevant psychological relations can actually obtain between
separate individuals. People who stand in close personal
relationships, for example, can influence each other&rsquo;s beliefs,
desires and character traits. He also seems to assume that these
relations are more important than other relations that might only
exist within individual people&rsquo;s lives (such as, perhaps, the
distinctly first-personal, phenomenological character of certain
memories). If Brink is right, we have (nearly) as much reason for
special concern about the well-being of significant others as about
our own. This could give rise to what he calls self-extended egoism
(Brink 1990, 1997).</p>

<p>
It has also been argued that respect for the separateness of persons
entails respect for what individuals would, in the form of a general
principle, consent to or choose for themselves. For example, in later
sections of <em>A Theory of Justice</em> Rawls points out that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[&hellip;] a love of mankind that wishes to preserve the distinction
of persons [&hellip; and] to recognize the separateness of life and
experience [&hellip;] is guided by what individuals themselves would
consent to [&hellip;]. (Rawls 1971: 191 [1999: 167])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, Rawls seems to think that the separateness of persons
supports contractualism&mdash;along with the egalitarian principles of
justice he thinks will result from it (Rawls 1971 [1999: 167]).
Similarly, Thomas Scanlon seems to think that taking into account the
standpoint of individuals will support his version of contractualism
and what he takes to result from it. Scanlon claims that principles
that no one can reasonably reject are the basis of what is permitted,
which means that every person has a veto that even the consent of all
others cannot override (e.g., Scanlon 1998 [2000: 202f, 241, 213ff]).
A central motivation for proponents of the contractualist method is
often that they expect it to lead to principles that will restrict
utilitarian trade-offs and aggregation in the specific way that their
own view favours. However, there are of course competing forms of
contractualism and, as demonstrated above, also various competing ways
of prohibiting or limiting inter-personal balancing and
aggregation.</p>

<p>
The vast array of different ethical theories and principles that have
been defended by appeal to the separateness of individuals seems to
demonstrate that an appeal to separateness, by itself, is not specific
enough to lend positive support to a particular ethical view (e.g.,
Rawls 1974; Brink 1993; D. Shoemaker 2007; 2009: 273&ndash;4). It can
also be argued that conclusions based on separateness often have
additional and more radical implications than assumed by the ones
drawing these conclusions (McKerlie 1988). Our status as separate
individuals can hardly support such conflicting views as
egalitarianism, non-egalitarian libertarianism, egoism, and competing
forms of limiting aggregation at the same time. This raises the
question whether the appeal to separateness may, at best, do a limited
amount of work as a negative argument, e.g., against certain features
of unrestricted utilitarianism.</p>

<h2 id="MetAlt">10. Methodological Alternatives</h2>

<p>
Rawls&rsquo;s famous passage, in which he says that utilitarianism
does not take seriously the distinction between persons (Rawls 1971
[1999: 24f]), does not specify what he means by &ldquo;the distinction
between persons&rdquo;, and other authors are equally inexplicit. This
has given rise to a debate over whether the separateness of persons is
supposed to be a metaphysical fact or a normative ideal. The normative
interpretation is the one that Rawls himself endorses in a subsequent
paper (Rawls 1974). According to some versions of the normative view,
the dependency relationship between the psychological relations that
practically matter and ethics actually runs the other way around than
previously assumed in this entry. It might, in fact, run from ethics
to the relations that matter.</p>

<p>
According to this understanding, different moral theories give rise to
different normative ideals of the person, or more specifically, to
different normative ideals of personal unity across time&mdash;that
is, different answers to the What-Matters question. It has been argued
that utilitarianism goes well with an understanding of persons as
containers for valuable experiences, without much regard for the
question of when and to whom these valuable experiences belong. In
contrast, a Kantian view is said to require stronger diachronic unity,
because Kantians are typically intrinsically interested in providing
an account of responsibility for fundamental interests over the span
of an entire life (Scheffler 1982a, 1982b; Darwall 1982).</p>

<p>
For example, Christine Korsgaard argues that viewing ourselves as
agents practically requires us to view ourselves as diachronically
unified, irrespective of the actual strength of the various
psychological connections between the temporal stages of our lives. We
have to view ourselves as unified across time because an agent&rsquo;s
deliberations, acts and rational life plans extent through time.
Furthermore, we also have to view ourselves as unified at any given
moment in time. This is due to the need of eliminating conflict among
our various desires and inclinations in order to be able to act. We
only have one body to act with after all (Korsgaard 1989).</p>

<p>
A similar line of reasoning motivates narrative accounts of personal
identity. According to the narrative criterion of personal identity,
what makes an action, experience, or a psychological characteristic
the one of a particular individual is its correct incorporation into
the self-told story of his or her life (Taylor 1989; Schechtman 1996;
DeGrazia 2005; Goldie 2012; Schroer &amp; Schroer 2014). We are not
merely passive experiencers of a loosely related chain of experiences
in our lives. The force that actively ties the occurrence of our
various experiences together, into the experiences of a particular
individual, is the creation of our own life story. Viewing ourselves
as beings capable of such biographical self-creation gives rise to
diachronic unity. According to Schechtman, what is appropriate for the
relation between identity and ethics is an answer to the
&ldquo;characterization question&rdquo;: What are the conditions under
which various psychological characteristics, experiences, and actions
are properly described as the ones of a particular person (Schechtman
1996: ch. 4). Imagine, for instance, a subject of experiences to whom
various experiences merely happened over time. The events would be
unified in a purely passive respect, simply as the experiences
contained within the life of that subject of experiences. But for that
subject to be a person, a genuine moral agent, those experiences must
be actively unified, must be gathered together into the life of one
narrative ego by virtue of a story the subject tells that weaves them
together (Schechtman 1996: 136&ndash;162). In this sense, the view
that we are creators of our own lives gives rise to diachronic
unity.</p>

<h2 id="Con">11. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
For several reasons, the relationship between personal identity and
ethics is complex. First, it is still unclear what the correct theory
of identity is. This is partly due to the controversy on whether we
are essentially psychological entities or animals. It is also due to
the fact that there are various competing psychological views. Second,
there is still a significant debate over whether it is identity as
such that matters, or whether the psychological or biological
relations it consists of are what is relevant for normative and
ethical concerns. And finally, as discussed in the last section of
this entry, the priority relation between personal identity (or any
other relation that arguably matters) and ethics remains unsettled.
One can either establish the correct account of what matters as a
fixed foundation for the investigation of the impact in ethics, or,
alternatively, one can construct the theories of what matters and of
our ethical concerns in light of each other, for example by way of a
reflective equilibrium.</p>
