<h1>Dehumanization</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Mar 24, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Dehumanization is widely thought to occur when someone is treated or
regarded as less than human. However, there is an ongoing debate about
how to develop this basic characterization. Proponents of <em>the
harms-based approach</em> focus on the idea that to dehumanize someone
is to <em>treat</em> them in a way that harms their humanity; whereas
proponents of <em>the psychological approach</em> focus on the idea
that to dehumanize someone is to <em>think</em> of them as less than
human. Other theorists adopt a pluralistic view that combines elements
of both approaches.</p>

<p>
In addition to explaining different views on what it means to
dehumanize someone, this article focuses on related issues, such as
how to resolve the so-called &ldquo;paradox of dehumanization&rdquo;;
the causes and consequences of dehumanization; the sorts of contexts
in which dehumanization typically occurs; and the relation between
dehumanization and objectification.</p>

<h2 id="HisOve">1. Historical overview</h2>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, ideas about what it means to dehumanize someone have
co-evolved with ideas about what it means to be human (Kronfeldner
2018, 2021b). Contemporary ideas about what it means to be human are
often influenced by the varieties of humanism that emerged during the
Renaissance and Enlightenment. During this period, some humanists
emphasized the idea that to be human is to possess a certain sort of
&ldquo;human dignity&rdquo;. Others focused on the idea that to be
human is to possess certain &ldquo;natural&rdquo; rights, such as
liberty and equality, where these rights were thought to be grounded
in distinctively human capacities, such as autonomy and rationality
(Copson 2015). If one adopts these ideas about what it means to be
human, then it is natural to think that dehumanization occurs whenever
someone&rsquo;s dignity or natural rights are violated. This way of
thinking about dehumanization is reflected in various versions of the
harms-based approach (see
 <a href="#HarBasAppDeh">&sect;2</a>);
 as well as those versions of the psychological approach according to
which dehumanization involves thinking of someone as lacking agency or
rationality (see
 <a href="#TheGraDeh">&sect;3.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Another way in which ideas about humanness and dehumanization have
co-evolved concerns modern ideas about biological humanness.
Darwin&rsquo;s discovery that human beings and nonhuman animals have a
shared ancestry led to spurious ideas about certain groups of people
being less than fully human in a biological-evolutionary sense: these
ideas are a key element of the pseudoscientific view known as
&ldquo;scientific (or biological) racism&rdquo; (Steizinger 2021).
Some proponents of the psychological approach have developed ways to
measure this form of dehumanization and have found that it remains
alarmingly prevalent (see
 <a href="#MeaDeh">&sect;3.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Academic research into dehumanization has been thriving for decades.
It has become highly interdisciplinary, encompassing fields such as
philosophy, social and developmental psychology, neuroscience,
political science, sociology, peace and conflict studies, genocide
studies, and gender studies.</p>

<p>
The models of dehumanization developed by social psychologists have
been especially influential. An initial wave of models emerged during
the latter part of the twentieth century (Kelman 1973; Bandura,
Underwood, &amp; Fromson 1975; Staub 1989; Struch &amp; Schwartz 1989;
Bar-Tal 1989; Opotow 1990; Bandura, Barbaranelli, et al. 1996).
Proponents of these models often drew on qualitative analyses of
extreme violence, such as the Holocaust and the Mai Lai massacre.
During the early 2000s, a &ldquo;new look&rdquo; emerged, with models
supported by lab-based studies: these models were also geared more
towards capturing the &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; and &ldquo;implicit&rdquo;
forms of dehumanization that purportedly occur in everyday contexts
(see
 <a href="#TheGraDeh">&sect;3.2</a>&ndash;<a href="#MeaDeh">&sect;3.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Within philosophy, influential discussions of dehumanization began to
appear during the mid-twentieth century. Arendt (1951, 1963, 1977)
discussed dehumanization&rsquo;s role in war, genocide, totalitarian
regimes, and colonialization (see also Levi 1947 [1959], 1986 [1988]).
Other influential works during this period focused on dehumanization
in the context of gender oppression (de Beauvoir 1949; Dworkin 1981,
1987; LeMoncheck 1985, 1997; MacKinnon 1987, 1989, 1993; Nussbaum
1995a, 1995b). Today, dehumanization is studied in various subfields
of philosophy. This has led to different views on what dehumanization
is, and what a theory of dehumanization can explain.</p>

<h2 id="HarBasAppDeh">2. The harms-based approach to dehumanization</h2>

<p>
Proponents of the harms-based approach argue that to dehumanize
someone is to treat them in a way that harms or diminishes their
humanity.</p>

<h3 id="VarHarBasApp">2.1 Variants of the harms-based approach</h3>

<p>
The harms-based approach often figures in feminist accounts of sexual
objectification (see entry on
 <a href="../feminism-objectification/">feminist perspectives on objectification</a>).
 MacKinnon (1987, 2006) and Dworkin (1981, 1985, 1987) defend the
Kantian view that certain capacities, such as autonomy and
subjectivity, are central to being human, and that to undermine
someone&rsquo;s ability to exercise these capacities is to
&ldquo;objectify&rdquo; or &ldquo;dehumanize&rdquo; them. For
instance, Dworkin (1985 [2000: 30&ndash;31]) remarks that when a human
being is treated in a way that does not respect their autonomy, they
are &ldquo;turned into a thing or commodity&rdquo;, and that
&ldquo;those who can be used as if they are not fully human are no
longer fully human in social terms; their humanity is hurt by being
diminished&rdquo; (see also de Beauvoir 1949; LeMoncheck 1985; Dworkin
1987 [1997: 140&ndash;141]; Gardner &amp; Shute 2000; Cudd 2006).</p>

<p>
Nussbaum (1995a) defends a similar view. She distinguishes between
permissible and impermissible forms of objectification, identifying
dehumanization with the latter, but not the former (e.g., see 1995a:
276). Permissible cases of objectification involve treating someone
&ldquo;as an object&rdquo;, while respecting their humanity.
Impermissible cases involve treating someone &ldquo;as an
object&rdquo;, but without even tacitly respecting their humanity.
Nussbaum takes treating someone &ldquo;as an object&rdquo; to involve
any, or all, of the following: instrumentality; denial of autonomy;
inertness; fungibility; violability; ownership; and denial of
subjectivity. Even though Nussbaum repeatedly emphasizes that
objectification is a way of <em>treating</em> someone, in certain
places she explicitly endorses the disjunctive thesis that
objectification involves <em>treating</em> and/or <em>seeing</em>
someone as an object (e.g., see Nussbaum 1995a: 251). This suggests
that Nussbaum holds a pluralistic view that includes elements of both
the harms-based approach and the psychological approach (see also Cudd
2006: 165&ndash;166).</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Nussbaum (1995b, 2000) develops a version of humanist
feminism according to which there are certain capacities that are
central for &ldquo;truly human functioning&rdquo; (2000: 6). She
argues that exercising these capacities to a certain degree is
required for leading a &ldquo;fully human life&rdquo; (2000: 74). Some
of these capacities include bodily integrity, bodily health, practical
reason, emotions, and affiliation (2000: 78&ndash;90). On this
account, then, to dehumanize someone is to inhibit their ability to
realize these capacities because doing so undermines their ability to
lead a &ldquo;truly human life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
According to Mikkola&rsquo;s version of the harms-based account, an
action is dehumanizing if and only if &ldquo;it is an indefensible
setback to some of our legitimate human interests, where this setback
constitutes a moral injury&rdquo; (2016: 145; see also Mikkola 2021).
&ldquo;Legitimate human interests&rdquo; include those that (i) are
widely shared by members of our biological species (<em>Homo
sapiens</em>), and (ii) contribute to the basic well-being of members
of our biological species, such as &ldquo;the ability to set
one&rsquo;s own life plan&rdquo; (2016: 165); &ldquo;the continuance
of life&rdquo; (2016: 168); and the ability &ldquo;to enjoy and
maintain friendships&rdquo; (2016: 168). A setback to one of these
legitimate human interests constitutes a &ldquo;moral injury&rdquo;
when it damages the &ldquo;realization and acknowledgement of the
person&rsquo;s value&rdquo; (2016: 170). For example, Mikkola suggests
that telling a white lie need not count as dehumanization, because
even though it may count as morally wrong on other grounds, it may not
set back any legitimate human interest, or it may count as a morally
permissible setback (2016: 174).</p>

<p>
Killmister (2024) argues that dehumanization is constituted by
&ldquo;actions and practices that function to erode people&rsquo;s
membership in the socially constructed category of the human&rdquo;
(2024: 2). Killmister (2024: 3) draws on Searle&rsquo;s (1995) view
that social categories are constructed and maintained by the
collective acceptance of two kinds of rules: <em>constitutive
rules</em> and <em>deontological rules</em> (see also Rust 2021 and
the entry on
 <a href="../social-ontology/">social ontology</a>).
 Constitutive rules specify the conditions an entity must satisfy to
count as a member of the given social kind, while deontological rules
specify the powers the entity must possess. Killmister suggests that
in contemporary liberal societies, being a <em>Homo sapiens</em>
counts as a constitutive rule for membership in the social kind
<em>HUMAN</em>, while having human rights counts as a deontological
rule for membership (2024: 3). Killmister argues the social category
<em>HUMAN</em> is also constructed and maintained by two other sorts
of factors: (i) broad &ldquo;norms of treatment&rdquo;, such as having
one&rsquo;s death marked in some way; and (ii) &ldquo;the social
imaginary&rdquo; which encompasses &ldquo;the stories that we tell
about our shared humanity and our self-understanding as human&rdquo;
(2024: 4). Given this framework, Killmister argues that there are
three forms of dehumanization. &ldquo;Constitutive
dehumanization&rdquo; involves actions that are intended to undermine
a constitutive rule for being human (Killmister 2024: 5&ndash;6);
&ldquo;corrosive dehumanization&rdquo; involves attempting to modify
the constitutive rules indirectly &ldquo;by challenging who the
deontological rules and norms of treatment apply to&rdquo; (2024:
6&ndash;9); and &ldquo;hermeneutic dehumanization&rdquo; occurs when
&ldquo;the social imaginary forecloses certain ways of being
human&rdquo;, such as being a human with a non-binary gender (2024:
9).</p>

<p>
There is a key difference between Killmister&rsquo;s version of the
harms-based approach and those outlined above. For Killmister,
&ldquo;dehumanization&rdquo; refers to attempts&mdash;successful or
otherwise&mdash;to undermine someone&rsquo;s status as
&ldquo;human&rdquo; by influencing the criteria for membership in the
social kind <em>HUMAN</em>. For other proponents of the harms-based
approach, dehumanization does not necessarily involve an attempt to
reconstruct the social kind, <em>HUMAN</em>: rather, it involves a
successful attempt to undermine someone&rsquo;s humanity by inhibiting
some of their distinctively human capacities or interests.</p>

<h3 id="GenArgAgaHarBasApp">2.2 General arguments against the harms-based approach</h3>

<p>
Some philosophers have raised general concerns with the harms-based
approach (for some critiques of specific versions, see Guenther 2012;
Mikkola 2016, 2021; Killmister 2024). Smith (2021, 9&ndash;29) argues
that an adequate conception of dehumanization should distinguish
between dehumanization itself and the sorts of harms that it causes.
Given that proponents of the harms-based approach <em>identify</em>
dehumanization with certain sorts of harms, Smith argues that they do
not leave adequate room for this distinction.</p>

<p>
Insofar as proponents of the harms-based approach hold that certain
capacities are &ldquo;essentially human&rdquo;, they are vulnerable to
anti-essentialist arguments concerning human nature (see the entry on
 <a href="../human-nature/">human nature</a>).
 Consider the claim that some capacities are &ldquo;essentially
human&rdquo; in the sense that they are unique to and shared by all
human beings. Various theorists have argued that there are no such
capacities: instead, there is a high degree of genetic and phenotypic
variation within our species, which is required for evolution by
natural selection to occur (Hull 1978, 1986; Kronfeldner, Roughley,
&amp; Toepfer 2014; Kronfeldner 2018). Anti-essentialism thereby casts
doubt on the claim that dehumanization involves inhibiting
&ldquo;essentially human&rdquo; capacities or interests.</p>

<p>
Some proponents of the harms-based approach address this sort of
concern head-on by explicitly rejecting the type of essentialism
outlined above. For instance, Nussbaum (1995c: 88) argues that which
capacities are essential to being human is determined by our norms and
values, as opposed to &ldquo;matters of natural scientific fact&rdquo;
(for a critique of Nussbaum&rsquo;s essentialism, see Antony 2000).
Mikkola (2016: 165&ndash;170) avoids essentialist claims about human
nature altogether. She holds that dehumanization involves undermining
someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;legitimate human interests&rdquo; in certain
ways; however, for a legitimate interest to count as
&ldquo;human&rdquo;, it need only be widely, as opposed to
universally, shared by members of our species.</p>

<p>
Other arguments against the harms-based approach stem from the sorts
of views defended by sentientists and posthumanists, who tend to
resist the idea that what makes certain ways of treating other people
wrong is that their <em>humanity</em> is being harmed or diminished
(Crary 2021: 162&ndash;163). For instance, according to Singer (1975,
2010), how one ought to treat another individual does not depend on
whether they are a human being per se, but rather on the interests
they happen to possess, such as the interest in not suffering. On this
view, purportedly &ldquo;dehumanizing&rdquo; forms of mistreatment are
not wrong because they harm the victim&rsquo;s humanity: they are
wrong because they frustrate the victim&rsquo;s interests in certain
ways, irrespective of species membership.</p>

<h2 id="PsyAppDeh">3. The psychological approach to dehumanization</h2>

<p>
According to the psychological approach, to dehumanize someone is to
<em>think</em> of them as less than human. The literature on the
psychological approach contains a maze of overlapping ideas. In
general, though, versions of this approach can be roughly sorted into
two families: those that focus mainly on <em>categorical</em>
dehumanization, and those that focus mainly on <em>graded</em>
dehumanization. Categorical dehumanization occurs when someone is
judged as not belonging to the category <em>HUMAN</em>; whereas graded
dehumanization occurs when someone is merely judged as <em>less
humanlike</em> than certain other members of the category
<em>HUMAN</em>.</p>

<h3 id="TheCatDeh">3.1 Theories of categorical dehumanization</h3>

<h4 id="SubThe">3.1.1 Subhumanization theory</h4>

<p>
Smith (2011, 2014, 2016, 2021) argues that to categorically dehumanize
someone is to believe that they possess a &ldquo;subhuman
essence&rdquo;. Drawing on research into psychological essentialism
(see Neufeld 2022), Smith argues that the dehumanizer thinks of these
human and subhuman essences as having the following features: (1)
Possession of them does not come in degrees; (2) they are inherited;
(3) they are immutable (one cannot go from being subhuman to human or
vice versa); and they ground certain generalizations (e.g.,
&ldquo;Subhumans are dangerous&rdquo;). Importantly, Smith also argues
that in paradigmatic cases of dehumanization, such as Nazi
antisemitism, dehumanizers often hold contradictory beliefs about
their victims: on the one hand, they think of them as subhuman; but on
the other hand, they cannot help but think of them as human due to
their humanlike appearance (Smith 2016; 2021: 206&ndash;255). Smith
argues that these conflicting thoughts give rise to a feeling of
&ldquo;uncanniness&rdquo; in the dehumanizer (see also
 <a href="#DoDehHavConBel">&sect;4.2</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="AmbThe">3.1.2 Ambiguity theories</h4>

<p>
Other theories of categorical dehumanization focus on the idea that
while dehumanizers often categorize their victims as human in a
biological-species sense, they categorically deny that they are human
in a different, non-biological, sense. In what follows, these theories
of categorical dehumanization will be referred to as &ldquo;ambiguity
theories&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
For instance, Steizinger (2018) observes that some Nazi ideologues
deployed two concepts of humanness: a biological-species concept, and
a metaphysical concept of the human &ldquo;race-soul&rdquo;, which
they saw as grounding the ability to form culture and a
&ldquo;collective identity&rdquo;. Proponents of this Nazi ideology
believed that Jewish people are categorically human in the
biological-species sense, but categorically nonhuman in the
metaphysical sense.</p>

<p>
Drawing on lab-based studies, Phillips (2022a, 2023) argues that
people tend to have two concepts of humanness: a descriptive concept,
and a normative concept of &ldquo;true&rdquo; (or &ldquo;real&rdquo;)
humanness. To be human in the descriptive sense is to be a member of
the biological species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, whereas to be human in
the normative sense is to possess a deep-seated, emotionally-laden,
commitment to good moral values. For example, Phillips (2022a)
presents evidence that people tend to agree that serial killers are
not &ldquo;true humans&rdquo;, even if they are human in a
&ldquo;biological sense&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
According to de Ruiter (2023a, 2023b), denying that someone is human
in the non-biological sense is a matter of failing to recognize that
their capacity for subjective experiences is &ldquo;a factor that
counts against his or her mistreatment&rdquo; (2023b: 82): in other
words, it is to regard them as outside the sphere of moral
concern.</p>

<h3 id="TheGraDeh">3.2 Theories of graded dehumanization</h3>

<p>
In contrast to the theories of dehumanization outlined above, the
theories devised by social psychologists tend to focus more on
<em>graded</em> dehumanization.</p>

<h4 id="InfTheDuaMod">3.2.1 Infrahumanization theory and the dual model</h4>

<p>
According to <em>infrahumanization theory</em> (Leyens, Paladino, et
al. 2000; Leyens, Rodriguez-Perez, et al. 2001), to dehumanize someone
is to perceive them as having an &ldquo;incomplete human
essence&rdquo;, where having an incomplete human essence involves
lacking uniquely human capacities to some extent. In developing this
idea, Leyens and colleagues focused on the distinction between
&ldquo;primary&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; emotions. An emotion
counts as &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; if people tend to think of it as
uniquely human: examples include guilt and nostalgia. In contrast, an
emotion counts as &ldquo;primary&rdquo; if people tend to think of it
as experienced by human beings and nonhuman animals alike: examples
include fear and pleasure. Thus, according to Leyens and colleagues,
when we think of someone as highly capable of experiencing primary
emotions, but as relatively incapable of experiencing secondary
emotions, we have thereby &ldquo;infrahumanized&rdquo; them&mdash;that
is to say, we have perceived them as having an incomplete human
essence.</p>

<p>
The <em>dual model</em> builds on infrahumanization theory by drawing
a distinction between two kinds of dehumanization:
<em>animalistic</em> and <em>mechanistic</em> (Haslam et al. 2005). To
animalistically dehumanize someone is to regard them as lacking, to
some extent, attributes that are considered &ldquo;uniquely
human&rdquo;. Haslam and colleagues found that people tend to regard
attributes such as rationality, civility, refinement, maturity, and
moral sensibility as uniquely human. Thus, according to the dual
model, when we regard someone as lacking these sorts of attributes to
some extent, we perceive them as relatively animal-like. To
mechanistically dehumanize someone is to regard them, to some extent,
as lacking attributes that are considered essential aspects of
&ldquo;human nature&rdquo; (even if these attributes are shared with
nonhuman animals). Haslam and colleagues found that people tend to
regard attributes such as emotional responsiveness, openness, warmth,
agency, and emotional depth, as aspects of human nature. Thus,
according to the dual model, when we regard someone as lacking these
sorts of attributes to some extent, we perceive them as relatively
object-like or robotic.</p>

<h4 id="MinPerThe">3.2.2 The mind perception thesis</h4>

<p>
Some researchers have developed models of dehumanization that focus
exclusively on the denial of mental capacities (H. Gray et al. 2007;
Epley, Waytz, &amp; Cacioppo 2007; Waytz et al. 2010; Waytz &amp;
Epley 2012). H. Gray and colleagues (2007) found that people&rsquo;s
mental-state attributions tend to vary along two dimensions:
<em>agency</em> and <em>experience</em>. To attribute agency to
someone is to regard them as possessing the sorts of capacities that
we associate with goal setting and planning, whereas to attribute
experience to someone is to regard them as possessing feelings,
emotions, and other subjective experiences. Gray and colleagues also
found that people tend to regard humans as more agentic than nonhuman
animals, and as more capable of experience than inanimate objects.
Thus, according to Gray and colleagues&rsquo; <em>agency-experience
model</em>, this engenders two forms of dehumanization: one occurs
when we regard someone as relatively non-agentic; and the other occurs
when we regard someone as relatively incapable of subjective
experiences.</p>

<h4 id="SteConMod">3.2.3 The stereotype content model</h4>

<p>
According to the <em>stereotype content model</em>, we tend to judge
fellow humans along two primary dimensions: warmth and competence
(Fiske et al. 2002). This differentiates outgroups into four clusters:
(1) high warmth and high competence (<em>high-high</em>); (2) high
warmth and low competence (<em>high-low</em>); (3) low warmth and high
competence (<em>low-high</em>); and (4) low warmth and low competence
(<em>low-low</em>).</p>

<p>
Harris and Fiske (2006) argue that only the members of low-low groups,
such as homeless people, are dehumanized. They defend this claim by
presenting evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is
inactive when people view the low-low, but active in all other cases.
Given that mPFC activation &ldquo;reliably covaries with social
cognition&rdquo;, Harris and Fiske interpret this as evidence that the
low-low are &ldquo;not processed primarily as human beings&rdquo;
(2006: 849; see also Harris &amp; Fiske 2011).</p>

<p>
More recently, Fiske (2021) has developed a variant of the stereotype
content model according to which there are <em>three</em> forms of
dehumanization. As was claimed in the original version of the theory,
one form occurs when someone is perceived as low-low. According to
Fiske, this form of dehumanization resembles animalistic
dehumanization and involves feelings of disgust (2021: 248). Another
form occurs when someone is perceived as competent, but cold. Fiske
suggests that this form resembles mechanistic dehumanization to some
extent, and typically involves feelings of envy (2021: 248). For
example, Fiske notes that high-achieving women are vulnerable to this
form of dehumanization. Finally, a third form of dehumanization occurs
when someone is perceived as warm but incompetent. Fiske argues that
the elderly and the disabled are often subjected to this
&ldquo;pitying dehumanization&rdquo; (2021: 249).</p>

<h4 id="PerDeh">3.2.4 Perceptual dehumanization</h4>

<p>
Some theorists have developed models of <em>perceptual
dehumanization</em>, with an emphasis on the idea that we sometimes
visually perceive others as less than human. For instance, Fincher and
Tetlock (2016) present evidence that people tend to process the faces
of criminals in a relatively non-configural manner, meaning that the
eyes, nose, mouth, etc., are not perceived together as a gestalt, but
as separate features. Fincher and Tetlock found that the faces of
criminals therefore <em>look</em> less humanlike than the faces of
non-criminals, which are processed in a more configural manner (see
also Fincher &amp; Tetlock 2016; Hugenberg et al. 2016; Fincher,
Tetlock, &amp; Morris 2017).</p>

<p>
Vaes et al. (2019) presented participants with images of scarcely
dressed men and women, interspersed with doll-like avatars. Neural and
behavioral indicators suggested that participants were visually
perceiving the scarcely dressed women and the doll-like avatars in a
similar manner. Vaes and colleagues conclude that objectified women
are visually perceived, not just thought of, as object-like.</p>

<p>
Varga (2021) argues that we can visually perceive both
<em>animacy</em> and <em>mentality</em>: the former involves
perceiving something as an animate being, while the latter involves
perceiving something as having a mind. Thus, he argues that when
someone is visually perceived as lacking either animacy or mentality,
they have been perceptually dehumanized.</p>

<h4 id="ImpDeh">3.2.5 Implicit dehumanization</h4>

<p>
Psychologists have also developed models of <em>implicit
dehumanization</em>. Some have presented evidence that people
associate certain social groups with animals or animal-related terms
(Viki, Winchester, et al. 2006; Goff, Eberhardt, et al. 2008;
Saminaden et al. 2010; Rudman &amp; Mescher 2012). For example, in a
series of studies, Goff and colleagues (2008) found some evidence that
in the United States, people tend to implicitly associate Black people
with apes. Other researchers have found that people tend to associate
secondary emotions more with their ingroup than with an outgroup
(Paladino et al. 2002).</p>

<p>
It is important to recognize that the term &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; is
used in various ways by psychologists. The term &ldquo;implicit
measure&rdquo; is often used to refer to those instruments, such as
the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al. 1998), that assess
people&rsquo;s thoughts or feelings in a way that is
&ldquo;indirect&rdquo; (e.g., they do not rely on subjects&rsquo;
self-reports). On the other hand, some psychologists use the term
&ldquo;implicit&rdquo; to refer to a distinctive type of psychological
state or process. Most notably, psychologists often claim that
&ldquo;implicit&rdquo; states and processes are associative as opposed
to propositional; and unconscious as opposed to conscious (see the
entry on
 <a href="../implicit-bias/">implicit bias</a>).
 In presenting evidence for &ldquo;implicit dehumanization&rdquo;,
some researchers explicitly adopt both claims. For instance, Goff and
colleagues interpret their findings as evidence for &ldquo;a
bidirectional association between Blacks and apes that can operate
beneath conscious awareness&rdquo; (Goff, Eberhardt, et al. 2008: 304;
see also Saminaden et al. 2010). However, in presenting evidence for
&ldquo;implicit dehumanization&rdquo;, other researchers do not make
any claims about the associations in question being unconscious (e.g.,
see Paladino et al. 2002; Viki, Winchester, et al. 2006; Rudman &amp;
Mescher 2012).</p>

<h3 id="MeaDeh">3.3 Measures of dehumanization</h3>

<p>
In developing the psychological approach, researchers have drawn on
multiple measures of dehumanization.</p>

<h4 id="ImpVerExpSubVerBlaMea">3.3.1 Implicit versus explicit and subtle versus blatant measures</h4>

<p>
As was explained above, some researchers deploy measures of
dehumanization that are &ldquo;implicit&rdquo; in the sense that they
assess dehumanizing mental states in a way that is
&ldquo;indirect&rdquo;. For instance, in assessing whether
participants in their studies associate Black people with apes, Goff
and colleagues (2008) did not explicitly ask them whether they
associate Black people with apes. Instead, participants completed
various tasks that involved reacting to images and words pertaining to
either Black people or apes. Performance on these tasks was then used
to assess whether they implicitly associate Black people with apes. In
contrast, other measures are more &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; in the sense
that participants are asked to assess someone&rsquo;s humanity in a
relatively direct way.</p>

<p>
Another influential distinction concerns &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;blatant&rdquo; measures of dehumanization. According to Kteily
and Landry (2022a: 225), a measure of dehumanization counts as
&ldquo;blatant&rdquo; to the extent that an ordinary person would
&ldquo;readily recognize&rdquo; that it is designed to assess
dehumanization; whereas a measure of dehumanization counts as
&ldquo;subtle&rdquo; to the extent that they would not (for a similar
explanation, see Haslam 2021: 134).</p>

<p>
The most influential measure of blatant dehumanization has been
developed by Kteily and colleagues (2015). Their measure uses the
&ldquo;Ascent of Hu(man)&rdquo; image, which depicts a series of
&ldquo;evolving&rdquo; individuals, starting with some stereotypically
ape-like individuals on the left, through to a modern <em>Homo
sapiens</em> on the right. Using the image as a guide, participants
are asked to rate the extent to which the members of certain groups
seem &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; and &ldquo;humanlike&rdquo; on a scale from
0 to 100. Given that it would be readily apparent to an ordinary
participant that they are being assessed on dehumanization, Kteily and
colleagues&rsquo; Ascent scale qualifies as a blatant measure.</p>

<p>
To illustrate why some measures of dehumanization count as
&ldquo;subtle&rdquo;, reconsider infrahumanization. In developing
infrahumanization theory, Leyens and colleagues (Leyens, Paladino, et
al. 2000; Leyens, Rodriguez-Perez 2001) began by asking people to rate
the extent to which various emotions are uniquely human. As was
explained above in
 <a href="#InfTheDuaMod">&sect;3.2.1</a>,
 participants in these studies tended to regard certain emotions, such
as jealousy and nostalgia, as uniquely human. Then, in
<em>independent</em> studies, participants were asked to rate the
extent to which the members of certain social groups exhibit these
secondary emotions. Presumably, participants in the latter studies did
not readily recognize that they were being assessed for
dehumanization: from their perspective, they were just being asked to
rate the extent to which various people experience emotions such as
jealousy and nostalgia. The measures in question therefore qualify as
more subtle than blatant.</p>

<p>
The distinction between <em>implicit</em> versus <em>explicit</em>
measures is often regarded as orthogonal to the distinction between
<em>subtle</em> versus <em>blatant</em> measures (e.g., see Kteily,
Bruneau, et al. 2015; Kteily &amp; Landry 2022a). The two distinctions
are also commonly regarded as spectrums, rather than strict
dichotomies (e.g., see Haslam 2013, 77; Kteily, Bruneau, et al. 2015;
Kteily &amp; Landry 2022a).</p>

<h4 id="CriExtMeaDeh">3.3.2 Critiques of extant measures of dehumanization</h4>

<p>
Some theorists have raised concerns about the <em>construct
validity</em> of certain measures of dehumanization: an instrument is
<em>construct valid</em> if and only if it measures the theoretical
construct that it is intended to measure. For example, if an item in a
questionnaire is designed to measure narcissism, but it actually
measures self-confidence, then this item lacks construct validity.</p>

<p>
Enock and colleagues argue that the measures used by proponents of
both infrahumanization theory and the dual model lack construct
validity because they fail to distinguish between dehumanizing
attitudes and the mere attribution of antisocial traits (Enock,
Tipper, &amp; Over 2021; Enock, Flavell, et al. 2021; see also Over
2021; Enock &amp; Over 2022). More specifically, they argue that
people do not, in fact, attribute uniquely human traits to ingroup
members more than outgroup members. Instead, they present evidence
that people merely have a bias towards attributing <em>prosocial</em>
traits to ingroup members, and <em>antisocial</em> traits to outgroup
members, regardless of whether the traits in question are perceived as
uniquely human (for a direct reply, see Vaes 2023; and for some
defenses of the construct validity of other measures, see Kteily,
Bruneau, et al. 2015; Bruneau, Jacoby, et al. 2018; Phillips
2023).</p>

<p>
Some researchers have addressed ethical concerns about Kteily and
colleagues&rsquo; Ascent of (Hu)man scale. Izydorczak, Grzyb, and
Dolinski (2022) assessed the hypothesis that engaging with the scale
might <em>cause</em> participants to see certain outgroup members as
relatively unevolved and ape-like: more so than they would have
otherwise. However, their study found no evidence of this.</p>

<h3 id="GenArgAgaPsyApp">3.4 General arguments against the psychological approach</h3>

<p>
Some theorists have raised relatively general arguments against the
psychological approach to dehumanization.</p>

<p>
Smith (2023) critiques what he regards as the three major accounts of
dehumanization within social psychology: the dual model, the mind
perception thesis, and the stereotype content model. First, he argues
that they do not fit with paradigmatic cases of dehumanization, such
as Nazi antisemitism (2023: 2). For example, he argues that they are
incompatible with the fact that Nazi ideologues regarded Jewish people
as intelligent, rational, and highly competent. Second, he argues that
these models neglect &ldquo;the most egregious cases of blatant
dehumanization&rdquo; in which the victims are seen as
&ldquo;monstrous, demonic, evil beings&rdquo; with &ldquo;superhuman
powers&rdquo; (2023: 2&ndash;3). Finally, he argues that denials of
humanness are always categorical, whereas according to the models in
question, they come in degrees (2023: 3). Smith (2014, 2023) argues
that dehumanization is always categorical because it involves
attributing a subhuman essence to someone, and attributions of
essences do not come in degrees (for an extended argument that
dehumanization need not involve attributing a subhuman essence to
someone, see Kronfeldner 2021c; see also Killmister 2024).</p>

<p>
Some critics argue that proponents of the psychological approach
conflate dehumanization with other negative attitudes (Over 2021;
Bloom 2022; see also Rai, Valdesolo, &amp; Graham 2018; Enock,
Flavell, et al. 2021; Enock, Tipper, &amp; Over 2021). For instance,
Bloom (2022: 539) argues that in much of the psychological literature
&ldquo;the notion of dehumanization extends to seemingly any instance
in which people think badly about another individual or group&rdquo;.
He goes on to suggest that this approach &ldquo;stretches the notion
beyond recognition&rdquo; (2022: 539; for some direct replies to this
argument, see Kteily &amp; Landry 2022b; Phillips 2023).</p>

<p>
Probably, the most influential critique of the psychological approach
is that in purportedly central cases of dehumanization, such as Nazi
antisemitism, the victims were not persecuted because they were seen
as less than human: instead, they were persecuted precisely
<em>because</em> they were seen as human (Appiah 2008; Lang 2010,
2020; Johnson 2017; Manne 2016, 2017: chapter 5; Bloom 2017, 2022;
Rai, Valdesolo, &amp; Graham 2017; Enock, Flavell, et al. 2021; Over
2021; Enock, Tipper, &amp; Over 2021; Enock &amp; Over 2022; see also
Kuper 1989). For instance, Manne argues that dehumanization is not a
central feature of misogyny because misogynists see women as
&ldquo;potentially <em>dangerous</em> and <em>threatening</em> in ways
only a human being can be&rdquo; (2016: 148). More generally, Manne
suggests that &ldquo;only a human being can sensibly <em>be</em>
conceived as an enemy, a rival, a usurper, a subordinate, a traitor,
and the like&rdquo; (2016: 153). Relatedly, some theorists have
emphasized that the perpetrators in purportedly central cases of
dehumanization often see the victims as morally responsible for their
perceived crimes. For example, the lynching of African Americans was
frequently cast as bringing the guilty to justice; and the Nazis
subjected Jewish people to humiliating forms of punishment. This might
suggest that the perpetrators in these cases saw their victims as
human beings after all, for it would not make sense to humiliate and
punish a creature that is not human, such as a rat (Appiah 2008: 144;
Lang 2010; Manne 2016, 2017; Bloom 2017; Over 2021).</p>

<h2 id="ParDeh">4. The paradox of dehumanization</h2>

<p>
The fact that perpetrators in purportedly central cases of
dehumanization think of their victims as having distinctively human
attributes is known as &ldquo;the paradox of dehumanization&rdquo;
(Smith 2016).</p>

<h3 id="DoePsyAppLacExpPow">4.1 Does the psychological approach lack explanatory power?</h3>

<p>
As was discussed in
 <a href="#GenArgAgaPsyApp">&sect;3.4</a>,
 some theorists try to resolve the paradox by concluding that the
psychological approach to dehumanization has little explanatory power
(Appiah 2008; Lang 2010; Manne 2016, 2017: chapter 5; Bloom 2017,
2022; Over 2021; see also Jordan 1968). For example, Bloom (2022)
remarks that &ldquo;Nobody could doubt that we sometimes think of one
another as less than human&rdquo;. However, he goes on to argue that
thinking of someone as less than human is rarer than proponents of the
psychological approach tend to think (see also Bloom 2017; Over 2021;
Leader Maynard 2022: 114). In developing this solution to the paradox,
some theorists argue that dehumanizing language is usually
metaphorical, and that it is merely intended to convey negative ideas
about the victims, such as the idea that they are disgusting and
dangerous <em>humans</em> (Over 2021; Manne 2016: 163&ndash;165).</p>

<h3 id="DoDehHavConBel">4.2 Do dehumanizers have contradictory beliefs?</h3>

<p>
Another way to resolve the paradox is to claim that dehumanizers often
possess contradictory beliefs about their victims, simultaneously
thinking of them as both human <em>and</em> subhuman. In defending
this solution, Smith (2016; 2021: 206&ndash;255) argues that
dehumanizers normally acquire the belief that their victims are
subhuman via propaganda and other ideological influences; whereas they
acquire the belief that their victims are human via the mechanisms
responsible for the visual detection of human faces (2016: 435).
According to Smith, the co-occurrence of these inconsistent beliefs
gives rise to a feeling of &ldquo;uncanniness&rdquo; in the
dehumanizer, because the victim is perceived as a creature who
transgresses &ldquo;culturally sanctioned metaphysical
categories&rdquo; (2016: 430). Smith goes on to suggest that when the
victim is seen as threatening, they are also seen as horrifying and
monstrous (he calls this &ldquo;demonizing dehumanization&rdquo;); but
when they are not perceived as threatening, they are merely regarded
as uncanny (he calls this &ldquo;enfeebling
dehumanization&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 id="DoDehHavMulConHum">4.3 Do dehumanizers have multiple concepts of humanity?</h3>

<p>
Ambiguity theorists attempt to resolve the paradox by arguing that
dehumanizers possess multiple concepts of humanity, simultaneously
viewing their victims as &ldquo;human&rdquo; in one sense, but as less
than &ldquo;human&rdquo; <em>in a distinct sense</em> (see
 <a href="#AmbThe">&sect;3.1.2</a>).
 For instance, Phillips (2022a, 2023) argues that the Nazis regarded
Jewish people as biological humans, yet they denied that they are
&ldquo;real&rdquo; or &ldquo;true&rdquo; humans in a distinctively
normative sense precisely because they regarded them as essentially
evil, possessing traits such as criminality and deceitfulness (see
also Steizinger 2018). Similarly, de Ruiter (2023a, 2023b) argues that
dehumanizers often see their victims as <em>Homo sapiens</em> with
species-typical capacities for subjective experiences; however, they
deny that their victims are &ldquo;human&rdquo; in the sense that they
view them as lacking moral status.</p>

<h3 id="DoDehSimAffDenDifAspOthHum">4.4 Do dehumanizers simultaneously affirm and deny different aspects of others&rsquo; humanity?</h3>

<p>
Instead of resolving the paradox by holding that dehumanizers have
multiple <em>concepts</em> of humanity, some theorists attempt to
resolve it by arguing that dehumanizers can simultaneously recognize
certain <em>aspects</em> of an individual&rsquo;s humanity, whilst
also denying others (Fincher, Kteily, &amp; Bruneau 2018; Kteily &amp;
Landry 2022a; Leader Maynard &amp; Luft 2023: 3). For example, there
is evidence that intelligence and good moral character are central to
people&rsquo;s concept of humanness (see
 <a href="#PsyAppDeh">&sect;3</a>).
 Thus, a dehumanizer might simultaneously recognize an outgroup
member&rsquo;s intelligence, but deny that they possess good moral
character&mdash;plausibly, this was how Nazi ideologues tended to
perceive Jewish people.</p>

<p>
In developing this approach, Kteily and Landry (2022a: 231&ndash;234)
suggest that people have a Platonic concept of the &ldquo;ideal
human&rdquo;, and that the degree to which someone is dehumanized is
determined by their perceived distance from this Platonic ideal.
Perceived distance from the ideal human is determined by two factors:
(1) which traits the dehumanizer perceives the target as possessing or
lacking; and (2) how central each trait is to the dehumanizer&rsquo;s
concept of ideal humanness. For example, suppose morality is more
central to a dehumanizer&rsquo;s concept of ideal humanness than
intelligence. Moreover, suppose that this dehumanizer perceives person
<em>A</em> as intelligent, but immoral, and person <em>B</em> as
moral, but unintelligent. According to Kteily and Landry, then, this
dehumanizer will perceive both individuals as less than fully human,
but they will perceive <em>A</em> as less human than <em>B</em>. More
to the point, the dehumanizer will perceive both individuals as less
than fully human, even though they perceive both <em>as humanlike in
certain respects</em>.</p>

<h3 id="DoePluResPar">4.5 Does pluralism resolve the paradox?</h3>

<p>
Finally, some theorists address the paradox by adopting a pluralistic
view of dehumanization: that is to say, a view that combines elements
of both the psychological approach and the harms-based approach
(Nussbaum 1995a, Kronfeldner forthcoming).</p>

<p>
For instance, Nussbaum (1995a) argues that to dehumanize someone is to
either treat or see them as an object, without even tacitly respecting
their humanity (see
 <a href="#VarHarBasApp">&sect;2.1</a>).
 Nussbaum does not address the paradox of dehumanization explicitly;
however, she makes the following remark about a case of dehumanizing
sexual objectification:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What is made sexy &hellip; is precisely the act of turning a creature
whom in one dim corner of one&rsquo;s mind one knows to be human into
a thing, a something rather than a someone. (1995a: 281)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Nussbaum appears to be claiming that the victim is subjected to
dehumanizing <em>treatment</em>, even though they are tacitly
<em>thought</em> of as human. This suggests a view according to which
dehumanization sometimes occurs even when the dehumanizer recognizes
the victim as human, because they are still subjecting them to
dehumanizing treatment.</p>

<p>
Kronfeldner (forthcoming) adopts a pluralist account according to
which there are multiple &ldquo;forms&rdquo; and &ldquo;levels&rdquo;
of dehumanization. &ldquo;Forms&rdquo; of dehumanization include
categorical and graded denials of humanness. &ldquo;Levels&rdquo;
include &ldquo;behavioral dehumanization&rdquo; (i.e., the type of
behavior regarded as dehumanizing by proponents of the harms-based
approach); &ldquo;cognitive dehumanization&rdquo; (i.e., thinking of
someone as less than human); and &ldquo;rhetorical
dehumanization&rdquo; (i.e., depicting someone as less than human).
Kronfeldner&rsquo;s framework also includes the claim that there are
three different senses of being human: a &ldquo;group sense&rdquo;
according to which being human means being part of a group (e.g., the
species <em>Homo sapiens</em>); a &ldquo;property sense&rdquo;
according to which being human requires having certain properties
(e.g., rationality); and a &ldquo;moral sense&rdquo; according to
which being human means having moral standing. According to
Kronfeldner (forthcoming), once we adopt this pluralist framework, the
paradox of dehumanization becomes a &ldquo;mirage arising from
misplaced abstraction&rdquo;. This is because in the sorts of cases
that allegedly generate the paradox, dehumanization is likely
occurring with respect to at least one form, one level, and one sense
of being human. For example, on Kronfeldner&rsquo;s account, even if a
perpetrator thinks of a victim as human <em>in all three senses</em>,
so long as they subject them to the relevant sorts of harms, they will
count as dehumanizing them at &ldquo;the behavioral level&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="ExpConDeh">5. Explanations and consequences of dehumanization</h2>

<p>
In addition to the debate about what it means to dehumanize someone,
there are ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of
dehumanization.</p>

<h3 id="ProVerUltExp">5.1 Proximal versus ultimate explanations</h3>

<p>
In seeking to explain how and why dehumanization occurs, it is useful
to distinguish between &ldquo;proximal&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; explanations. A proximal explanation of some
phenomenon aims to identify the mechanisms that tend to produce it in
any given moment; whereas an ultimate explanation seeks to identify
the relatively distal factors that explain <em>why</em> it exists in
the first place. In evolutionary biology, ultimate explanations invoke
the fitness consequences of a given trait (Scott-Phillips, Dickins,
&amp; West 2011). However, sometimes the phrase &ldquo;ultimate
explanation&rdquo; is used more broadly to refer to the relatively
distal causes of some trait or phenomenon, but without this
necessarily involving an appeal to fitness consequences (Smith 2021:
176). In this section, the term &ldquo;ultimate explanation&rdquo;
will be used in this broad sense.</p>

<p>
In attempting to provide ultimate explanations of dehumanization,
proponents of the psychological approach often argue that it
facilitates equanimity on the part of the dehumanizer. The most common
version of this idea is that dehumanization helps the dehumanizer to
overcome their inhibitions against participating in violence (Bandura,
Underwood, &amp; Fromson 1975; Kelman 1973, 1976; Opotow 1990;
Bandura, Barbaranelli, et al. 1996; Goldhagen 2009; Smith 2011, 2021;
Savage 2013; Kronfeldner 2021b: 11&ndash;12; Machery 2021). For
instance, Smith (2021: 206&ndash;224) argues that humans have an
automatic inhibition against killing fellow humans and that thinking
of certain people as subhuman is one way for mass killers to disable
it. To illustrate, Smith (2021: 222) suggests that Heinrich Himmler
devised the gas chambers, in part, because they minimized the sort of
face-to-face encounters that might cause Nazi camp guards to perceive
their victims as human, thereby activating the inhibition against
killing fellow humans.</p>

<p>
Other proponents of the psychological approach emphasize that by
harboring dehumanizing thoughts, dehumanizers are not just able to
override inhibitions against committing extreme violence in the
future: it also enables them to rationalize and cope with acts of
extreme violence <em>after</em> they have already committed them
(Bandura 1999; Castano &amp; Giner-Sorolla 2006; Luft 2020, 2023; see
also Lelieveld et al. 2024).</p>

<p>
Some theorists argue that the functions of dehumanization go beyond
facilitating hostile acts. For instance, one idea is that people
dehumanize outgroup members to cope their own mortality (de Beauvoir
1949; Nussbaum 2004, 2013; Heflick &amp; Goldenberg 2013). Another
idea is that we dehumanize people to minimize the emotional costs of
empathizing with them, even in contexts in which we are helping them
(Cameron, Harris, &amp; Payne 2016).</p>

<p>
Finally, in providing ultimate explanations of dehumanization, some
proponents of the psychological approach have focused on the role of
dehumanizing ideologies (Hagan &amp; Rymond-Richmond 2008; Steizinger
2018, 2021; Smith 2021; Leader Maynard &amp; Luft 2023). For instance,
Smith (2021: 192&ndash;194) explains how certain racializing
ideologies paved the way for the belief that Jewish people are demonic
and subhuman.</p>

<p>
Like some of the theorists mentioned above, proponents of the
harms-based approach often argue that people dehumanize others to
maintain hostile and oppressive relationships with them. For example,
Mikkola remarks that &ldquo;dehumanization works by utilizing the
subjects&rsquo; human agency, so that they are put back to their place
should they venture to rebel&rdquo; (2021: 338). Similarly, MacKinnon
(1987, 1989, 2006) and Dworkin (1981, 1985, 1987) both argue that
dehumanizing objectification exists, in large part, because of the way
that social hierarchies frame the objectifier&rsquo;s sexual desires
(see also Nussbaum 1995a: 290).</p>

<p>
Dehumanization researchers have also defended numerous ideas about the
more <em>proximate</em> causes of dehumanization. Proponents of the
psychological approach have presented evidence that individuals with
certain character traits are more likely to harbor dehumanizing
thoughts: examples include narcissism (Locke 2009); nationalism (Viki
&amp; Calitri 2008); right-wing authoritarianism (Maoz &amp; McCauley
2008; Kteily, Bruneau, et al. 2015); and social dominance orientation
(Hodson &amp; Costello 2007). Some proponents of the psychological
approach have also presented evidence that transitory mental states,
such as disgust (Harris &amp; Fiske 2011; Landry, Ihm, &amp; Schooler
2022a) and perceived threat (Viki, Osgood, &amp; Phillips 2013; Maoz
&amp; McCauley 2008) tend to trigger dehumanizing thoughts. Relatedly,
some have presented evidence that we tend to form dehumanizing
thoughts about others when we believe that they harbor dehumanizing
thoughts about <em>us</em>: this has become known as
&ldquo;metadehumanization&rdquo; (Kteily, Hodson, &amp; Bruneau 2016;
Landry, Ihm, &amp; Schooler 2022b).</p>

<p>
Another cluster of ideas concerning the proximate causes of
dehumanization centers on people&rsquo;s beliefs about humanness. One
idea is that dehumanization is driven by the belief that to be human
is to possess an underlying human essence (Smith 2011, 2014, 2016,
2021; Landry, Ihm, Protzko, &amp; Schooler 2022; although, see
Kronfeldner 2021c). Another idea is that dehumanizing thoughts are
driven by the belief that to be human is to possess a morally good
&ldquo;true self&rdquo; (Phillips 2022a, 2023). Finally, there is also
evidence that dehumanization is driven by the belief that humans are
fundamentally superior to nonhuman animals (Costello &amp; Hodson
2010, 2014; see also Smith 2011, 2021).</p>

<p>
Relatedly, some researchers have stressed that dehumanizing beliefs
are directly influenced by the conception of humanness that prevails
in the given socio-cultural context (Kronfeldner 2017, 2018;
Steizinger 2018; Leader Maynard &amp; Luft 2023; see also Smith 2013).
For example, Leader Maynard and Luft (2023, 2) argue that the
prevailing ideology in Nazi Germany fueled the belief that various
ethnic outgroups were &ldquo;biologically inferior forms of the human
species&rdquo;; whereas in Stalin&rsquo;s Soviet Union, animalistic
dehumanization took on a different guise because Marxist-Leninist
ideology precluded this &ldquo;biological hierarchization&rdquo; of
humanness.</p>

<p>
In discussing the means through which dehumanizing ideologies are
transmitted, some researchers have focused on how propaganda and
derogatory language can cause people to have dehumanizing thoughts
(Hagan &amp; Rymond-Richmond 2008; Tirrell 2012; Steizinger 2018;
Smith 2011, 2021; Leader Maynard &amp; Luft 2023). For instance, using
the Rwandan genocide as a case study, Tirrell argues that certain
derogatory speech acts &ldquo;train potential participants to
dehumanize their targets&rdquo; (2012: 211). Similarly, Smith argues
that propaganda can &ldquo;motivate men and women to slaughter one
another&rdquo; by &ldquo;inducing men to regard their enemies as
subhuman creatures&rdquo; (2011: 71).</p>

<p>
Proponents of the harms-based account have also theorized about the
proximate causes of dehumanization. In examining the proximate causes
of objectifying dehumanization, some feminists have focused on
pornography (see the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-objectification/">feminist perspectives on objectification</a>).
 For example, Langton (1995: 178) remarks that &ldquo;As a matter of
human psychology, when men sexually use objects, pornographic
artifacts, as women, they tend to use real women as objects&rdquo;
(see also Assiter 1988: 68; Langton 2009: 38&ndash;39). However, other
defenders of the harms-based approach have resisted, or at least
heavily qualified, the claim that pornography is among the
<em>primary</em> causes of objectifying dehumanization (see MacKinnon
1993: 109 and 25; Nussbaum 1995a: 286, 290).</p>

<h3 id="Con">5.2 Consequences</h3>

<p>
Researchers have also defended various ideas about the consequences of
dehumanization. Some proponents of the psychological approach argue
that when someone is dehumanized, this often results in them being
perceived as having little or no moral standing (e.g., see Kelman
1973; Machery 2021). Importantly, though, not all proponents of the
psychological approach hold this view. For instance, some defend the
converse view that dehumanization is a consequence of perceiving
someone as having little or no moral standing (Opotow 1990); while
others hold that to perceive someone as having little or no moral
standing <em>just is</em> to dehumanize them (de Ruiter 2023a, 2023b;
see also Bandura 2002).</p>

<p>
Some proponents of the psychological approach argue that
dehumanization is a catalyst for genocide. For instance, according to
Stanton&rsquo;s (1998) influential Genocide Watch model,
dehumanization prepares genocidaires to overcome the &ldquo;normal
human revulsion against murder&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#GenWar">&sect;6.1</a>
 for more details).</p>

<p>
Social psychologists have conducted numerous lab-based studies to
examine the consequences of dehumanization. These studies suggest that
dehumanizing thoughts can lead to various forms of hostility, such as
support for wartime aggression (Jackson &amp; Gaertner 2010; Viki,
Osgood, &amp; Phillips 2013; Bruneau &amp; Kteily 2017; Slovic et al.
2020; Rousseau, Gorman, &amp; Baranik 2023; Landry, Fincher, et al.
2024); support for vengeance against perceived enemies (Kteily,
Bruneau, et al. 2015); the endorsement of harsher sentences in
criminal cases (Bastian, Denson, &amp; Haslam 2013; Fincher &amp;
Tetlock 2016); an unwillingness to support rehabilitation for criminal
offenders (Viki, Fullerton, et al. 2012); proclivity towards rape and
sexual harassment (Rudman &amp; Mescher 2012); and a reduced tendency
to help others (Cuddy, Rock, &amp; Norton 2007).</p>

<p>
In addressing these sorts of lab-based studies, some theorists have
argued the relation between dehumanization and hostility is more
complex than social psychologists tend to think. For instance, Leader
Maynard and Luft (2023) argue that the link between dehumanization and
violence is mediated by various factors that go beyond the psychology
of individuals, such as the ideological, social, and institutional
context in which the violence occurs. Similarly, Steizinger argues
that in studying the relation between dehumanization and mass
violence, theorists should go beyond the psychology of individuals and
consider &ldquo;ideological contexts and social practices&rdquo; as
well (2018: 157).</p>

<p>
Other theorists have argued that having dehumanizing thoughts about
someone only increases support for <em>certain types</em> of violence
against them. Most notably, Rai, Valdesolo, and Graham (2017) present
evidence that dehumanization increases support for &ldquo;instrumental
violence&rdquo; but not &ldquo;moral violence&rdquo;. They
characterize violence as &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; when it is used to
achieve some nonviolent goal, such as pain inflicted on animals in
medical research. In contrast, they characterize violence as
&ldquo;moral&rdquo; when it is driven by moral judgments of the
victims. In a series of studies, Rai and colleagues found that
dehumanizing attitudes increased support for instrumental, but not
moral, violence. They argue that dehumanization does not lead to moral
violence because it &ldquo;removes the very qualities that make moral
violence meaningful&rdquo; (2017: 8514), and that moral violence is
intentionally targeted towards &ldquo;complete human beings capable of
deserving, suffering, and understanding the harm done to them&rdquo;
(2017: 8515). Importantly, though, Rai and colleagues only tested the
agency-experience model of dehumanization (Fincher, Kteily &amp;
Bruneau 2018; see also
 <a href="#MinPerThe">&sect;3.2.2</a>).
 Moreover, other studies, deploying different models and measures,
suggest that dehumanization predicts support for both moral and
instrumental violence (e.g., see Bastian, Denson, &amp; Haslam 2013;
Kteily, Bruneau, et al. 2015; Slovic et al. 2020; Phillips 2023).</p>

<p>
Proponents of the harms-based approach have also theorized about the
consequences of dehumanization. One core idea is that dehumanizing
actions perpetuate systems of social hierarchy, oppression, and
control (MacKinnon 1987, 1989, 2006; Dworkin 1981, 1985, 1987;
LeMoncheck 1985, 1997; Nussbaum 1995a; Cudd 2006; Mikkola 2016). For
example, Mackinnon (1989: 127&ndash;128) and Dworkin (1985 [2000:
30&ndash;32]) both argue that by shaping men&rsquo;s sexual
preferences, the dehumanizing objectification of women results in
social inequality and the normalization of a male-dominated social
order. Similarly, Mikkola argues that dehumanizing actions often
result in the victim being &ldquo;put back to their place should they
venture to rebel and challenge their lot&rdquo; (2021: 338).</p>

<h2 id="DehDifCon">6. Dehumanization in different contexts</h2>

<p>
Researchers have invoked dehumanization in attempting to understand a
range of societal problems. This section outlines some common
examples.</p>

<h3 id="GenWar">6.1 Genocide and war</h3>

<p>
Dehumanization is widely seen as a common occurrence during war and
genocide (Kelman 1973; Staub 1989; Chalk &amp; Jonassohn 1990; Fein
1990; Goldhagen 1996, 2009; Stanton 1998; Hagan &amp; Rymond-Richmond
2008; Smith 2011, 2020, 2021; Savage 2013; Haslam 2020; Haagensen
&amp; Croes 2012; Landry, Orr, &amp; Mere 2022).</p>

<p>
According to the influential Genocide Watch model, dehumanizing
thoughts facilitate genocidal violence by preparing participants to
overcome &ldquo;the normal human revulsion against murder&rdquo;
(Stanton 1998; see also Goldhagen 2009; Smith 2021). Others emphasize
the idea that dehumanization also facilitates genocidal violence as it
unfolds. For example, one idea is that <em>during</em> periods of
genocidal violence, the killers need to maintain dehumanizing thoughts
about their victims to minimize distress and feelings of guilt (Smith
2011: 132&ndash;162; Haagensen &amp; Croes 2012: 225; Haslam 2020:
131). Other theorists argue that participants in genocide often begin
by seeing their victims as fully human, but that dehumanization
becomes increasingly common as they adapt to the experience of
committing extreme violence (Luft 2020, 2023).</p>

<p>
Evidence from lab-based studies suggests that the more civilians
dehumanize their military rivals, the more likely they are to support
various forms of military violence. For instance, some studies suggest
that dehumanizing thoughts predict support for torturing prisoners of
war (Viki, Osgood, &amp; Phillips 2013); while others suggest that
dehumanizing thoughts predict support for the indiscriminate bombing
of both military personnel and civilians (Kteily, Bruneau, et al.
2015; see also Jackson &amp; Gaertner 2010; Leidner, Castano, &amp;
Ginges 2013; Bruneau &amp; Kteily 2017; Slovic et al. 2020; Rousseau,
Gorman, &amp; Baranik 2023; Landry, Fincher, et al. 2024).</p>

<p>
Some theorists have questioned whether dehumanization facilitates war
and genocide (see also
 <a href="#GenArgAgaPsyApp">&sect;3.4</a>
 on general arguments against the psychological approach). For
instance, Lang (2010) starts by defining &ldquo;dehumanization&rdquo;
as the denial of others&rsquo; &ldquo;subjectivity&rdquo;&mdash;in
other words, he appears to adopt a version of the mind perception
thesis (see
 <a href="#MinPerThe">&sect;3.2.2</a>).
 He then argues that concentration camp guards in Nazi Germany
recognized Jewish prisoners as humans with subjective experiences,
because one of their primary goals was to exert power over them by
subordinating their subjectivity to their own (for a response, see
Steizinger 2018). Leader Maynard (2022) agrees that dehumanization can
facilitate violence, however, he argues that its role in mass killing
is often exaggerated. For example, he argues that during World War II,
policymakers in Britain and the US perceived Germans as
&ldquo;contemptible&rdquo;, but &ldquo;rarely denied their
humanity&rdquo; (2022: 114).</p>

<h3 id="RacEth">6.2 Race and ethnicity</h3>

<p>
Lab-based studies suggest that the members of racial and ethnic
outgroups are especially vulnerable to dehumanization. Some of these
studies suggest that dehumanizing beliefs about the members of racial
and ethnic minorities predict reduced support for immigration (Hodson
&amp; Costello 2007; Esses et al. 2008; Kteily, Bruneau, et al. 2015:
913; Bruneau, Kteily, &amp; Laustsen 2018; Utych 2018; Markowitz &amp;
Slovic 2020; Landry, Ihm, &amp; Schooler 2022a). Other studies focus
on the dehumanization of racial and ethnic minorities in various parts
of the criminal justice system (see
 <a href="#CriJusSys">&sect;6.4</a>
 for more details).</p>

<p>
Some theorists have examined <em>why</em> racial and ethnic outgroups
are especially vulnerable to dehumanization (Smith 2011, 2021;
Costello &amp; Hodson 2014; Hund 2021; Jardina &amp; Piston 2021,
2023). For instance, Smith (2011: 163&ndash;201; 2021: 83&ndash;99)
argues that the dehumanization of whole groups of people is
&ldquo;typically preceded and facilitated by their
racialization&rdquo; (2021: 98; see also Hagan &amp; Rymond-Richmond
2008). In developing this thesis, Smith draws on studies suggesting
that people, including children, often have essentialist beliefs about
race. People with essentialist beliefs about race tend to think that
all and only members of the same racial group possess an underlying
&ldquo;racial essence&rdquo;, where this essence has certain key
properties. For example, there is evidence that racial essentialists
tend to think that racial essences are immutable; transmitted via
descent; and inductively rich (Hirschfeld 1996; see also Machery &amp;
Faucher 2017; Phillips 2022b). Smith argues that racial essentialism
and dehumanization are thus structurally similar, and that racial
essentialism often leads to the belief that members of the given
racial group possess a <em>subhuman</em> racial essence (2011:
200&ndash;201; 2021: 99; see also Landry, Ihm, Protzko, &amp; Schooler
2022).</p>

<h3 id="SlaCol">6.3 Slavery and colonialism</h3>

<p>
Various theorists have examined how dehumanizing ideologies are used
in attempts to legitimize slavery and colonialism (Patterson 1982;
Fredrickson 1971 [1987]; Jahoda 1999; Smith 2011: 112&ndash;123; 2021:
39&ndash;49, 145&ndash;146, and 74&ndash;81; Machery 2021; Jardina
&amp; Piston 2023).</p>

<p>
As Fredrickson observes, during the nineteenth century, White
Americans&rsquo; ideology concerning the enslavement of African people
often gravitated around two spurious ideas. The first idea was that
slaves are akin to children whose underdeveloped cognitive capacities
mean that they need parental-like guidance by their masters
(Fredrickson 1971 [1987: 55&ndash;58]; see also Jahoda 1999; Rollo
2018). The second idea was that slaves are akin to subhuman beasts who
need to be tamed by their masters (Fredrickson 1971 [1987:
55&ndash;58]; see also Jahoda 1999; Smith 2011: 115&ndash;119).</p>

<p>
Both ideas figure in other defenses of slavery (Stuurman 2021;
Sebastiani 2021; Machery 2021; Hund 2021). For instance, Aristotle
argued that certain people are &ldquo;natural slaves&rdquo; because
they are not naturally able to engage in rational deliberation.
According to Aristotle, it is therefore just and beneficial for these
people to receive direction from a master who can rationally
deliberate on their behalf (<em>Politics</em> I.5, 1254b21&ndash;23,
and I.13, 1260a12&ndash;13). Similarly, Sep&uacute;lveda (1547) argues
that the Spaniards&rsquo; enslavement of indigenous people was
justified because they &ldquo;are as inferior to the Spaniards as are
children to adults and women to men&rdquo; (1547 [1960: 526]). He also
invokes the idea that indigenous people exhibit
&ldquo;barbarity&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural slavery&rdquo; (1547 [1960:
528]).</p>

<p>
In discussing how these ideologies about slavery are dehumanizing,
Machery (2021) invokes the agency-experience model (see
 <a href="#MinPerThe">&sect;3.2.2</a>).
 He argues that enslaved people are seen as lacking in agency whenever
they are regarded as child-like or beast-like (2021: 152&ndash;154).
He also argues that enslaved people are often regarded as lacking
capacities for subjective experiences. For instance, he points out
that during the nineteenth century, defenders of slavery often claimed
that slaves are relatively insensitive to pain, and that they have an
underdeveloped capacity to experience moral emotions (2021:
154&ndash;155; see also Fredrickson 1971 [1987: 57&ndash;58]).</p>

<p>
Proponents of the harms-based approach have also examined the ways in
which slavery and colonialism are dehumanizing (see Nussbaum 1995a:
264; Mikkola 2016; Kara 2017; Sangiovanni 2017). Nussbaum (1995a: 264)
argues that slavery is dehumanizing because it involves using a human
being &ldquo;as a tool of one&rsquo;s own purposes&rdquo;. Kara argues
that slavery is dehumanizing because it produces conditions
&ldquo;that strip the person of his or her dignity and humanity&rdquo;
(2017: 35). For example, Kara argues that coerced labor often involves
restricting someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;freedom of movement, which is a
core freedom that makes us human&rdquo; (2017: 35).</p>

<p>
Not all theorists agree that dehumanization is a common feature of
slavery (see Jordan 1968; Cavell 1979 [1999: chapter 13]; Rinehart
2016; Johnson 2017). Historian Winthrop Jordan argues that despite
referring to Black slaves as &ldquo;subhuman&rdquo;, American
colonists must have thought of them as fully human because they had
&ldquo;human relationships&rdquo; with them. For example, Jordan notes
that the colonists frequently talked with their slaves, and they often
had (nonconsensual) sex with them (1968 [1969: 234]). This is an
example of the &ldquo;paradox of dehumanization&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#ParDeh">&sect;4</a>).
 Smith (2011: 112&ndash;123; 2021: 39&ndash;49 and 226&ndash;255)
addresses this instance of the paradox by arguing that slaveowners
tended to have contradictory beliefs about slaves, simultaneously
thinking of them as both human and subhuman (see
 <a href="#DoDehHavConBel">&sect;4.2</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="CriJusSys">6.4 The criminal justice system</h3>

<p>
Researchers in several disciplines have argued that dehumanization
occurs at multiple levels of the criminal justice system. Some studies
address dehumanization in the context of policing (Goff, Eberhardt, et
al. 2008; Goff, Atiba, et al. 2014; Zlobina &amp; Andujar 2021;
Perillo et al. 2023; see also Mekawi, Bresin, &amp; Hunter 2016,
2019). Other studies suggest that dehumanization affects beliefs about
punishment type and severity. For instance, there is evidence that the
animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization of criminals predicts
support for retributivist, instead of rehabilitative, forms of
punishment (Bastian, Denson, &amp; Haslam 2013; see also Osofsky et
al. 2005; Viki, Fullerton, et al. 2012; Giner-Sorolla, Leidner, &amp;
Castano 2012). There is also evidence that people find it easier to
punish criminals when they perceptually dehumanize them (Fincher &amp;
Tetlock 2016; see also
 <a href="#PerDeh">&sect;3.2.4</a>).
 Finally, there is evidence that when victim impact statements include
dehumanizing language, this enhances punitiveness towards defendants
in mock trials (Myers et al. 2004).</p>

<p>
Other researchers have focused more on the relation between
dehumanization and imprisonment. Drawing on the mind perception thesis
 (<a href="#MinPerThe">&sect;3.2.2</a>),
 Deska et al. (2020) found evidence that people regard
soon-to-be-released prisoners as more humanlike than those with more
time to serve. Some theorists have argued that solitary confinement is
dehumanizing in the sense that it inhibits or destroys one&rsquo;s
ability to exercise distinctively human capacities, such as the
ability to have meaningful relationships: this view is very much in
line with the harms-based approach to dehumanization (e.g., see
Coppola 2019). In contrast, Guenther (2012) argues that the harms of
solitary confinement cannot be adequately captured by an appeal to
&ldquo;dehumanization&rdquo;. Importantly, though, Guenther restricts
her attention to the harms-based approach to
dehumanization&mdash;especially those that invoke what she sees as
anthropocentric notions of &ldquo;human dignity&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="SexGen">6.5 Sex and gender</h3>

<p>
Dehumanization is widely regarded as central to sexual and gender
oppression. For example, proponents of the harms-based approach often
argue that that women are dehumanized whenever they are treated as
mere sexual objects, as opposed to human beings (LeMoncheck 1985;
MacKinnon 1987, 1989, 2006; Dworkin 1979, 1985, 1987; Nussbaum 1995a;
see also de Beauvoir 1949; Gardner &amp; Shute 2000; Cudd 2006). In
contrast, some philosophers reject this emphasis on objectification.
For instance, Mikkola (2016, 2021) argues that in central cases of
misogynistic dehumanization, such as rape, women are in fact treated
as subjects, as opposed to objects: nonetheless, they are dehumanized
because their &ldquo;self-set goals, aims, and life plans&rdquo; are
intentionally hampered (2021: 337).</p>

<p>
There are also debates about how dehumanization figures in specific
sorts of gender oppression. For instance, some feminist philosophers
argue that pornography is wrong, in part, because it treats and
depicts women as less than fully human (Dworkin 1981, 1985; Longino
1980: 45; MacKinnon 1987; Nussbaum 1995a; LeMoncheck 1997; Neufeld
2020; see also Mikkola 2019). In response, some philosophers argue
that pornography does not necessarily involve treating or depicting
pornographic actors as objects or as less than human (Saul 2006);
while others have questioned the assumption that it is wrong to see or
treat pornographic actors in this way (Soble 2002: 53&ndash;54).</p>

<p>
Social psychologists have also studied the relation between
dehumanization and different forms of sexual and gender oppression.
Much of this work focuses on the psychology of sexual objectification
(e.g., see K. Gray et al. 2011; Rudman &amp; Mescher 2012; Heflick
&amp; Goldenberg 2014; Roberts et al. 2018; Bevens &amp; Loughnan
2019). However, some of these studies focus on dehumanizing attitudes
towards people with certain sexual orientations (MacInnis &amp; Hodson
2012; Fasoli et al. 2016); while others focus on dehumanizing
attitudes towards people who are not cisgendered (Velez et al. 2016;
Anzani et al. 2021; Cascalheira &amp; Choi 2023).</p>

<h3 id="Dis">6.6 Disability</h3>

<p>
In examining the dehumanization of people with disabilities, some
proponents of the psychological approach have focused on eugenics. In
discussing the Nazis&rsquo; T4 euthanasia campaign against disabled
children, Smith (2021: 250&ndash;251) draws on his distinction between
&ldquo;demonizing dehumanization&rdquo; and &ldquo;enfeebling
dehumanization&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#DoDehHavConBel">&sect;4.2</a>).
 The former occurs when someone is regarded as a threatening subhuman;
while the latter occurs when someone is thought of as a docile and
non-threatening subhuman. Smith suggests that the Nazis tended to
dehumanize people with disabilities in the enfeebling way (for some
broader discussions of dehumanization in the context of eugenics, see
O&rsquo;Brien 1999; Garland-Thompson 2012; Keith &amp; Keith 2013;
Kittay 2016; Wilson 2021; Carlson 2023).</p>

<p>
Carlson (2023) distinguishes between cases in which people with
intellectual disabilities are &ldquo;animalized&rdquo;, and cases in
which they are seen as &ldquo;vegetables&rdquo;. In cases of
animalization, the victims are &ldquo;defined and treated as nonhuman
animals&rdquo; (2023: 7); whereas in cases of the latter, the victims
are regarded as &ldquo;even <em>lower</em> than animals&rdquo; (2023:
7; see also Carlson 2010: 31&ndash;33).</p>

<p>
Some disability scholars have argued that moral philosophers often
express dehumanizing attitudes towards people with intellectual
disabilities (Kittay 2005; Carlson 2010, 2023; Carlson &amp; Kittay
2009; Keith &amp; Keith 2013; Crary 2018, 2021). One core issue in
moral philosophy concerns what it takes to possess &ldquo;moral
status&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../grounds-moral-status/">the grounds of moral status</a>).
 Moral philosophers sometimes argue that certain cognitive capacities
are necessary for having moral status, and that species membership is
irrelevant. For instance, Singer (1975, 2010) argues that whether a
creature has moral status is not determined by its species per se, but
by the interests it happens to possess: in particular, the interest in
not suffering. In defending this approach, Singer has argued that
humans with severe cognitive disabilities can have less moral standing
than cognitively sophisticated nonhuman animals (see also McMahan
2005, 2010). Some disability scholars argue that these sorts of
comparisons are problematic because they &ldquo;animalize&rdquo;
people with intellectual disabilities (Kittay 2005; Carlson 2010,
2023). Relatedly, Crary suggests that because Singer&rsquo;s
capacity-based approach denies that being human is morally significant
per se, it must forfeit &ldquo;the pragmatically valuable thought that
animalizing ideologies are wrong because they dehumanize&rdquo; (2021:
166; see also Carlson 2023: 17).</p>

<p>
Social psychologists have presented evidence that people tend to
dehumanize those with disabilities. Some of these studies focus on
dehumanizing attitudes towards those with mental disabilities
(Martinez et al. 2011; Betancor Rodr&iacute;guez et al. 2016; Cage et
al. 2019; Boysen et al. 2020; Parker et al. 2020; Cooper &amp; Harwood
2024; Kim, Cheon, &amp; Kim 2025); while others focus more on the
dehumanization of those with physical disabilities (Kunst, Kteily
&amp; Thomsen 2019; Sim &amp; Hugenberg 2023; Sitruk et al. 2023).</p>

<p>
Finally, some proponents of the harms-based approach have argued that
people with disabilities are dehumanized in distinctive ways. For
instance, Gambrill (2014) argues that in using the <em>Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</em>, psychiatrists
dehumanize patients by reducing &ldquo;opportunities for freedom,
growth, and dignity&rdquo; (for a similar view, see Szasz 1970).</p>

<h3 id="Med">6.7 Medicine</h3>

<p>
Researchers often raise concerns about the dehumanization of patients
in medical settings (for some overviews, see Haque &amp; Waytz 2012;
Capozza et al. 2016; Hoogendoorn &amp; Rodr&iacute;guez 2023). In
examining the reasons <em>why</em> patients in medical settings are
vulnerable to dehumanization, Haque and Waytz (2012) distinguish
between &ldquo;functional&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonfunctional&rdquo;
causes of dehumanization (see also Capozza et al. 2016). They
characterize &ldquo;functional causes&rdquo; as those that are
necessary for providing &ldquo;effective and efficient health
care&rdquo; (2012: 182). For example, they argue that treating and
seeing patients as mechanical systems with interacting parts, rather
than humans with capacities for pain and negative emotional
experiences, &ldquo;frees up cognitive resources for clinical problem
solving&rdquo; (2012: 179) and reduces rates of burnout among
healthcare providers (2012: 182; see also Vaes &amp; Muratore 2013;
Trifiletti et al. 2014). Haque and Waytz characterize
&ldquo;nonfunctional causes&rdquo; of dehumanization as those that are
unnecessary for providing effective medical care, but that result from
&ldquo;other social practices that just happen to produce
dehumanization&rdquo; (2012: 183). For example, they argue that
patients often suffer from reduced agency because of their illnesses,
which in turn, causes caregivers to animalistically dehumanize them
(2012: 178).</p>

<p>
The distinction between functional and nonfunctional causes of
dehumanization is directly connected to a debate about whether
dehumanization is sometimes beneficial in medical contexts. Some
theorists argue that dehumanizing patients is a dysfunctional way for
healthcare providers to deal with stress and burnout, and that it
harms the relationship between patient and caregiver (Christoff 2014;
Capozza et al. 2016; see also Hoogendoorn &amp; Rodr&iacute;guez
2023). Other theorists argue that in certain contexts, the benefits of
dehumanizing patients outweigh the costs. For example, Palmer and
Schwan (2021) argue that replacing human caregivers with AI caregivers
will likely result in beneficial forms of dehumanization (for an
opposing view, see Sharkey &amp; Sharkey 2012). This is connected to a
more general debate about whether dehumanization is sometimes morally
permissible, and even beneficial, or whether it is always morally
wrong (Nussbaum 1995a; Papadaki 2010, 2015; Smith 2021: 23).</p>

<h2 id="RelBetDehObj">7. The relation between dehumanization and objectification</h2>

<p>
Dehumanization and objectification are usually seen as closely
related. This section focuses on whether they are equivalent, overlap,
or are completely distinct. The range of possibilities is depicted in
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>

different views on the relation between dehumanization and

</div>

<h3 id="DehObjEqu">7.1 Are dehumanization and objectification equivalent?</h3>

<p>
One possibility, depicted in
 <a href="#fig1a">Figure 1(a)</a>,
 is that dehumanization and objectification are equivalent. On this
view, there are no members of the category <em>dehumanization</em>
that are not also members of the category <em>objectification</em>,
and vice versa.</p>

<p>
As was explained in
 <a href="#VarHarBasApp">&sect;2.1</a>,
 some proponents of the harms-based approach seem to equate
dehumanization with objectification (for further discussion, see
Mikkola 2021). Dworkin possibly does so when she claims that
objectification occurs when a human being &ldquo;is made less than
human&rdquo; by being &ldquo;turned into a thing or commodity&rdquo;
(1985 [2000: 30&ndash;31]), however, she does not explicitly rule out
alternative, non-objectifying, ways of making someone less than human.
Cudd (2006: 165&ndash;166) uses the phrases
&ldquo;objectification&rdquo; and &ldquo;dehumanizing
objectification&rdquo; interchangeably to refer those cases in which
someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;full and equal status&rdquo; as a person is
ignored or damaged because their ability to express distinctively
human capacities has been hampered.</p>

<h3 id="ObjTypDeh">7.2 Is objectification a type of dehumanization?</h3>

<p>
The second possibility, depicted in
 <a href="#fig1b">Figure 1(b)</a>,
 is that objectification is a type of dehumanization. Some proponents
of the psychological approach defend a version of this view. For
instance, as was explained in
 <a href="#InfTheDuaMod">&sect;3.2.1</a>,
 proponents of the dual model argue that there are two forms of
dehumanization: animalistic and mechanistic (Haslam et al. 2005). The
former involves thinking of someone as relatively animal-like, whereas
the latter involves thinking of someone as relatively object-like or
robotic. Thus, on this view, objectification is one type of
dehumanization, alongside animalistic dehumanization (see also Fiske
2021).</p>

<h3 id="DehTypObj">7.3 Is dehumanization a type of objectification?</h3>

<p>
The third possibility, depicted in
 <a href="#fig1c">Figure 1(c)</a>,
 is that dehumanization is a type of objectification. Nussbaum (1995a)
defends a version of this view (see also Vaes, Loughnan, &amp; Puvia
2014). Nussbaum draws a distinction between permissible and
impermissible cases of objectification. Permissible cases occur when
someone is treated as an object, but their humanity is still respected
(1995a: 276). For example, she argues that objectification during sex
is often permissible and &ldquo;joyous&rdquo; precisely because each
person is recognized and treated as a human being (1995a: 275; see
also 2007: 51). Impermissible cases of objectification occur when
someone is treated as an object, but their humanity is not even
tacitly acknowledged. Thus, for Nussbaum, there are two kinds of
objectification: the impermissible kind that involves dehumanization,
and the permissible kind that does not. This suggests a view according
to which dehumanization is a type of objectification: namely, the
impermissible type.</p>

<h3 id="DehObjParOveCat">7.4 Are dehumanization and objectification partially overlapping categories?</h3>

<p>
The fourth possibility, depicted in
 <a href="#fig1d">Figure 1(d)</a>,
 is that dehumanization and objectification are partially overlapping
categories. On this view, we should recognize that</p>

<ol>

<li id="poss1">some things count as both dehumanization and
objectification;</li>

<li id="poss2">some things only count as dehumanization; and</li>

<li id="poss3">some things only count as objectification.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is not clear whether anyone explicitly defends this view in the
literature. However, elements of it have been defended by various
theorists. For instance, a proponent of the psychological approach
could defend (1), (2), and (3) in the following way. They could defend
 <a href="#poss1">(1)</a>
 by arguing that when someone is seen in a purely instrumental way,
they are both objectified <em>and</em> dehumanized. Following Haslam
and colleagues (2005), they could defend
 <a href="#poss2">(2)</a>
 by arguing that when someone is seen as animal-like, but not
object-like, they are dehumanized, but not objectified. Finally, they
could defend
 <a href="#poss3">(3)</a>
 by arguing that when a nonhuman animal is perceived in a purely
instrumental way, the animal is objectified, but not dehumanized (for
discussion of the objectification of nonhuman animals, see Adams 1990;
Loughnan, Haslam, &amp; Bastian 2010; Bastian et al. 2012).</p>

<p>
How might a proponent of the harms-based approach defend
 <a href="#poss1">(1)</a>,
 <a href="#poss2">(2)</a>, and
 <a href="#poss3">(3)</a>?
 It is clear how they could defend (1) and (3). In defending
(1)&mdash;the thesis that some things count as both dehumanization and
objectification&mdash;they could argue that when someone is treated as
a mere object, they are both objectified and dehumanized. In defending
(3)&mdash;the thesis that some things only count as
objectification&mdash;they could argue that when a nonhuman animal is
treated as a mere object, the animal is objectified, but not
dehumanized. It is less clear how a proponent of the harms-based
approach could defend (2)&mdash;the thesis that some things only count
as dehumanization&mdash;because they tend to regard dehumanization as
entailing objectification (see
 <a href="#DehObjEqu">&sect;7.1</a>).
 One exception is Mikkola who remarks that &ldquo;dehumanization does
not (and need not) involve objectification in the sense of viewing or
treating women as literally object-like or as if they were
objects&rdquo; (2021: 337). Using cases of misogynistic dehumanization
to illustrate this point, Mikkola argues that dehumanized women are
&ldquo;treated as subjects all right, just not self-determining
ones&rdquo; and that &ldquo;dehumanization turns on precisely aiming
to hamper and frustrate women&rsquo;s self-set goals, aims, and life
plans&rdquo; (2021: 337).</p>

<h3 id="DehObjComDisCat">7.5 Are dehumanization and objectification completely distinct categories?</h3>

<p>
Finally, dehumanization and objectification might be completely
distinct categories, as depicted in
 <a href="#fig1e">Figure 1(e)</a>.
 On this view, the two categories do not have any members in common,
and to think otherwise would be to commit a category mistake (see the
entry on
 <a href="../category-mistakes/">category mistakes</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The most obvious way to defend this view is to argue that
dehumanization is a way of <em>thinking</em> about others, whereas
objectification is a way of <em>treating</em> others (Smith 2021:
19&ndash;23). On this view, even though there are contexts in which
people think of others as less than human <em>and</em> treat them as
mere objects, it does not follow that dehumanization and
objectification are overlapping categories, because one is a type of
psychological attitude and the other is a way of treating people.</p>

<p>
Importantly, the view that dehumanization and objectification are
completely distinct categories does not entail that they are not
<em>causally</em> related. To illustrate, something cannot be both an
electron and a proton: clearly, though, electrons and protons are
causally related. Discussions of the causal relation between
dehumanization and objectification are relatively rare, however, some
theorists suggest that dehumanization can cause negative forms of
objectification (Gervais et al. 2013: 12&ndash;13); while others have
suggested that certain forms of objectification can cause
dehumanization (Mikkola 2016: 176; 2021: 338).</p>

<h2 id="FurIss">8. Further issues</h2>

<p>
Dehumanization is a growing topic of interest within academia and
popular culture. However, various challenges remain.</p>

<p>
One challenge concerns the scope of dehumanization. If, for example,
the term &ldquo;dehumanization&rdquo; is used too liberally to refer
to any negative thought or feeling about someone else, then it loses
its explanatory power: to borrow Paul Bloom&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;If
everything is dehumanization, then nothing is&rdquo; (2022). In
addressing this concern, it will be important for proponents of the
psychological approach to further examine how dehumanization is
distinct from other negative attitudes, such as dislike and contempt.
For proponents of the harms-based approach, the analogous challenge is
to delineate the border between the sorts of harms that qualify as
dehumanizing, and the sorts that do not.</p>

<p>
A related challenge concerns the proliferation of models and measures
of dehumanization within social psychology (see Landry &amp; Seli
2024). To what extent are these different models and measures getting
at different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon? It is possible
that people possess multiple concepts of being human, each one
engendering a completely distinct form of dehumanization (see
 <a href="#AmbThe">&sect;3.1.2</a>
 on ambiguity theories). Alternatively, it is possible that people
possess a single, multidimensional, concept of being human, and that
different versions of the psychological approach tap into different
dimensions of this concept (see
 <a href="#DoDehSimAffDenDifAspOthHum">&sect;4.4</a>).
 Relatedly, it will also be important for researchers to examine
whether the psychological approach to dehumanization is compatible
with the harms-based approach, or whether they should be considered
competing theories (for further discussion, see Smith 2021: chapter 1;
Kronfeldner forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Finally, another major challenge is addressing the broad contexts in
which dehumanization occurs. As some theorists have noted, social
psychologists often neglect the fact that dehumanizing attitudes,
along with their consequences, vary across the ideological, social,
and institutional contexts in which they occur (Leader Maynard &amp;
Luft 2023; see also Steizinger 2018 and Smith 2023). Thus, to fully
understand how and why dehumanization matters, researchers must move
beyond the level of the individual and develop models that address
these higher levels of analysis.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
