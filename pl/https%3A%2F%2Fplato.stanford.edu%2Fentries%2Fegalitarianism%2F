<p>
Egalitarianism is a school of thought in contemporary political
philosophy that treats equality as the chief value of a just political
system. Simply put, egalitarians <em>argue for equality</em>. They
have a presumption in favor of social arrangements that advance
equality, and they treat deviations from equality as <em>prima
facie</em> suspect. They recommend a far greater degree of equality
than we currently have, and they do so for distinctly egalitarian
reasons. One prominent strand of egalitarianism promotes
<em>distributive equality</em>: it demands that individuals get an
equal share of some goods. These <em>distributive egalitarians</em>
internally disagree on the nature of the goods to be distributed
equally (resources, opportunities, welfare, primary goods,
capabilities, etc.), and on the extent to which aspirations, choices,
and responsibility should influence our fair share. A second strand of
egalitarianism promotes <em>relational equality</em>: it demands that
we establish communities whose members relate and stand as equals,
without social hierarchies, relations of inferiority and superiority,
exploitation, or marginalization. These <em>relational
egalitarians</em> diverge on what a society of equals precisely
entails&mdash;that all members relate as equals, that all those who
relate do so as equals, that everyone is disposed to relate to others
as equals, that no one has the power to subordinate others, or a
combination of these elements. Both strands of contemporary
egalitarianism are liberal: while equality is conceptualized as a
chief value, a just society is also seen as one that protects an
extensive set of liberal rights and provides opportunities for
individuals to develop their own conception of the good life.</p>

<p>
At the most fundamental level, egalitarianism is grounded in <em>moral
equality</em>, also known as <em>basic equality</em>&mdash;the idea
that humans have equal moral worth and all count the same. One
prominent formulation of basic equality is articulated in the American
Declaration of Independence, which holds as self-evidently true
&ldquo;that all men are created equal&rdquo; (US 1776). Contemporary
egalitarians take for granted a version of this premise. They mostly
see their task, not as <em>proving</em> that we are equals, but as
theorizing what it means to treat persons as such, <em>given that we
are equals</em>. Egalitarians are not alone in this commitment to
basic equality. Most contemporary political theorists affirm that they
stand on this &ldquo;egalitarian plateau&rdquo; (Kymlicka 2002: 4). A
commitment to basic equality is not what makes contemporary
egalitarianism distinctive, therefore, and it is not what we currently
have in mind when referring to &ldquo;egalitarianism&rdquo;. Instead,
contemporary egalitarianism is identified through its
<em>substantive</em> commitment to structuring social institutions in
an egalitarian fashion&mdash;avoiding inegalitarian outcomes, and
promoting equality of wealth, welfare, or power. The background
against which contemporary egalitarians theorize falls critically
short of that ideal, though&mdash;with large and rising global wealth
inequalities, demonizing polarization, a rise of authoritarianism, and
continued hierarchies of class, gender, race, ability, citizenship,
caste, religion, and sexual orientation. And as people&rsquo;s ability
to see themselves as one another&rsquo;s equals is hindered by rank,
status, and wealth, the commitment to basic equality itself can seem
under threat. This inegalitarian context compels egalitarians to
advance, refine, and adapt egalitarian arguments, basic and
substantive.</p>

<h2 id="ArgForBasEqu">1. Arguing for Basic Equality</h2>

<p>
Contemporary egalitarianism defends social arrangements that promote
equality, already assuming that we are all equals and deserve to be
treated as such. But the concept of equal moral worth as such
didn&rsquo;t exist for much of history (McMahon 2023). On the
contrary, the idea that some humans are inferior by nature was
ubiquitous. Being an egalitarian thus first meant advancing arguments
against the <em>natural inequality thesis</em>, which served as a
justification for inegalitarian institutions. Arguing for equality, in
other words, centrally meant affirming humans&rsquo; equal moral
worth. Countless groups were deemed inferior by nature (for instance,
because of their sex, race, or class), and their subjection and
exploitation were justified by appeal to this alleged natural
inferiority. Their interests were discounted, much like the interests
of animals. To oppose inegalitarian institutions, egalitarians first
refuted the science, theology, and theory mobilized to support the
natural inequality thesis. Sometimes, it was members of oppressed
groups who took on this task. They appealed to human reason,
mobilizing experimental methods, personal narratives, scientific
explorations, as well as religious and moral appeals to convince their
audiences of their own equal human status, personhood, and moral
value. Contemporary egalitarians are all indebted to them (McMahon
2023: 162). Here are five examples.</p>

<h3 id="ConSocIneRou">1.1 Confronting Social Inequalities with Rousseau</h3>

<p>
In 1754, francophone philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote his
<em>Discourse on Inequality</em>, one of the most influential
egalitarian interventions in the history of philosophy (Rousseau
1755). Since Aristotle and Plato, the dominant view on equality was
<em>formal proportionalism</em>: like cases should be treated alike
(Plato <em>Laws</em>, 757 a-e; Aristotle <em>Politics</em>,
3.1280a10-20, 3.1282b18-23; Aristotle <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>,
5.1131a10-b15). This position entailed that equals ought to be treated
equally while non-equals don&rsquo;t need to be treated as such. The
view lends little support to a critique of social inequalities: within
this framework, it makes little sense to argue that those inferior by
status and nature (slaves, non-citizens, the poor, etc.) should be
treated as their superiors&rsquo; equals. But for Rousseau, this
reasoning rests on a logical fallacy: we witness vast social
inequalities around us and take these to be a reflection of natural
inequalities. In a vicious circular fashion, the naturalized social
inequalities then serve as justification for inegalitarian
institutions, which further cement the observed social inequalities.
By contrast, Rousseau understood inequalities as the result (rather
than the cause) of inegalitarian processes. We live in unequal
societies because we have set up social conventions, institutions, and
governments that generate and sustain social inequalities. To
denaturalize inequalities, Rousseau appealed to a thought experiment:
the state of nature. In this fictitious pre-social state, humans live
mostly peacefully and aren&rsquo;t very unequal in ability or need.
Some humans are physically stronger, more intelligent, or younger than
others, but not so much that they would be in a position to obtain a
lot more resources or power than others. They cannot transform might
into right, and there isn&rsquo;t any possession that couldn&rsquo;t
be taken away by a slightly more ingenious person or a small gang of
them. Without social convention, without laws and institutions to
protect individual ownership, there cannot be much accumulation of
resources or interpersonal domination. However, with the development
of civil society, including the transformational establishment of
private property, large social inequalities are rendered possible. We
lose the natural freedom that went along with our rough natural
equality. We become vulnerable to the will of those who have the most
and whose property rights are protected at the expense of the
subordinated poor and weak. This genealogy of social inequalities
helps us adopt a critical stance on economic and political
inequalities, one that sees them as unnatural and as threatening
freedom. Since we are co-dependent, we cannot leave civil society, or
go back to the state of nature. But our social institutions must be
reformed to reduce social and political inequalities, and to ensure we
can regain some kind of artificial freedom where we are not dominated
or subordinated by others (Rousseau 1762b). Rousseau did not, however,
view all social inequalities as unnatural. In fact, he did not apply
the same critical thinking to sexual (and racial) hierarchies which he
conveniently took to be truly grounded in nature: &ldquo;When woman
complains on this score about unjust man-made inequality, she is
wrong. This inequality is not a human institution&mdash;or, at least,
it is the work not of prejudice but of reason&rdquo; (Rousseau 1762a:
Book V [2009: 535]). (See also the entry on
 <a href="../rousseau/">Rousseau</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="ConSexIneWol">1.2 Confronting Sex Inequalities with Wollstonecraft</h3>

<p>
Born in 1759, Mary Wollstonecraft was a British women&rsquo;s rights
advocate who spent her life challenging conventions and social norms,
traveling without a husband, and even moving to France during the
French Revolution. She wrote several books and memoirs, including the
visionary and influential <em>A Vindication of the Rights of
Woman</em> in 1792 (Wollstonecraft 1792). In it, she took issue with
the widespread view that women are naturally inferior to men. She
forcefully argued that women&rsquo;s characters are the product of
their upbringing. From infancy, women are taught to act weak, soft,
and obedient so they may one day enjoy the protection of a man through
marriage. Women are taught to care mostly about their appearance and
are not encouraged to develop an individual character and
sophisticated intellectual faculties. Wollstonecraft understood that
she had to refute the naturalization of women&rsquo;s condition first
to then dismantle the unjust institutions and practices justified on
that basis. It is absurd, Wollstonecraft argued, to believe that a
girl is naturally a coquette or a housewife (Wollstonecraft 1792: 85).
After all, we can all recognize that we are profoundly shaped by the
education we receive and the social conventions that surround us. Even
if women were physically inferior to men, she asked, why educate them
to be even weaker physically than they could be? And in any case, why
should physical strength, which is otherwise disqualified as a source
of virtue, be taken to prove an overall natural inferiority to men?
Wollstonecraft rejected what she saw as fallacious argumentation. She
regretted that men&rsquo;s morals were so often corrupted by
conventions. Even as they so eloquently talked of equality and
freedom, they remained oblivious or silent on the sex inequalities
right in front of their noses. She criticized Rousseau, in particular,
for being so clear-sighted on how social inequalities arose while
endorsing the very same mechanisms to explain sex inequalities
(Wollstonecraft 1792: 45&ndash;48, 170&ndash;206). How could he, who
thought social inequalities were the result of conventions designed to
protect the powerful and dominate the propertyless, not see that women
were similarly groomed to serve the dominant sex? We should not use
the same bad arguments kings use to dominate the citizenry to justify
the subjection of women, Wollstonecraft forcefully objected. Sex
inequalities are equally injurious to morality. (See also the entry on
 <a href="../wollstonecraft/">Wollstonecraft</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="ConSlaCugDou">1.3 Confronting Slavery with Cugoano and Douglass</h3>

<p>
Abolitionists also understood that the denaturalization of
inequalities was a key argumentative step to undermine inegalitarian
institutions. Proponents of chattel slavery in the American South
argued that since nature is hierarchical, and since nature is
harmonious and respectable, hierarchy must be a desirable order for
human societies (Calhoun [d. 1850] in McKitrick 1963). In nature, the
strongest members of a species rule and dominate the weak, and that is
how species survive and progress. Like women and children, slaves
could not be set free, pro-slavery ideologues argued, because they
were inferior by nature. It is in their interest to be governed by a
master who takes responsibility for their well-being and protection.
Against these arguments, Frederick Douglass and Ottobah Cugoano, both
former slaves, painted a haunting picture of slavery as evil,
unnatural, ungodly, and unjust, and they helped establish the equal
moral worth of all humans in the process. In <em>Thoughts and
Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce
of the Human Species</em>, written in 1787, Cugoano shows that
scriptures support our universal humanity: they tell us that we are
all sons of Noah and that all men should love their neighbors as
themselves (Cugoano 1787). Slavery is the expression of brutal avarice
and wickedness, it undermines sacred family bonds, and so it is
ungodly. Humans&rsquo; universal dignity commands instead that no one
should ever be treated as a commodity or a beast, and that all humans
have the right to be their own masters. Like Rousseau, Cugoano
emphasized that inequality between humans is artificial and man-made.
No one is a slave by nature: they become a slave through a treacherous
and ungodly act of human theft. Cugoano knew that better than anyone:
he was born free and became a slave after being kidnapped as a child
in 1770. In <em>Narratives of the Life of a Slave</em>, written in
1845, Douglass described the systemic murders, rapes and beatings
slaves were subjected to. These depictions of brutality shatter the
false construct of slavery as a benevolent institution. Slavery is a
perpetual state of violence, rather, which dehumanizes those who take
part in it: slaves are brutalized and slaveowners turned into brutes
in the process. The stark inequalities witnessed in slavery are the
result of oppressive institutions rather than the product of natural
differences. Once more, the work of egalitarians consisted in
dismantling the idea that some human beings are naturally inferior to
others. What makes slaves inferior is the misfortune of being born or
pressed into slavery, and the violence, material deprivation, and
denial of education that come with it. Douglass stood as a living
proof of his thesis, showing that access to education frees the mind
and enables humans to regain the dignified status they deserve. (See
also the entry on
 <a href="../frederick-douglass/">Douglass</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="ConClaExpMar">1.4 Confronting Class Exploitation with Marx</h3>

<p>
Karl Marx&rsquo;s critique of capitalism has had one of the most
long-lasting influences on egalitarianism. In a large body of work
spanning half of the nineteenth century, Marx provided a sharp
analysis and critique of the exploitation suffered by the proletariat
at the hands of the rising bourgeoisie (Marx <em>Das Kapital</em>
1867, 1885, 1894). Through a process of expropriation, dispossession
and enclosure, a nascent bourgeois class gained ownership of the means
of capital accumulation. To survive under capitalism, the landless
class (the proletariat) has to sell their labor to the owners of the
means of production (the capitalists). Capitalists make profit by
wrongfully appropriating the surplus value of the proletariat&rsquo;s
work. Marx saw this bourgeois exploitation as a form of domination
(Vrousalis 2013; Leipold 2024). What sustains an inegalitarian system
designed to serve the few at the expense of the many? One answer is
ideology&mdash;a system of beliefs shared by oppressors and oppressed
that reflects how the means of production are structured (Marx 1867;
Marx &amp; Engels 1932). In a capitalist society, ideology
rationalizes and legitimizes the dominant position of the capitalists
<em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> the workers (for instance, through the
belief that the unemployed are lazy, that the wealthy have their
wealth because they are the most intelligent or productive, that
everyone can become rich if only they work hard, that wage-labor is a
free relationship in which the worker voluntarily sells their labor
force, etc.). To overcome capitalism, the proletariat needs to gain
<em>class consciousness</em>&mdash;an awareness of their shared fate
as dominated parties in an exploitative relationship: &ldquo;The
proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world
to win. Working men of all countries unite!&rdquo; (Marx &amp; Engels
1848 [1976: 456]). As an egalitarian alternative to capitalism, Marx
envisioned a classless economic system in which inheritance and
private property would be abolished&mdash;<em>communism</em>.
Individuals would be more free under communism, he believed, because
they would not be dominated by a capitalist employer and because their
lives would not be dedicated to alienated labor. Despite all of this,
there is a sense in which it is odd to characterize Marx as an
&ldquo;egalitarian&rdquo; (Wood 2014). Marx viewed equality as a
bourgeois ideal. Bourgeois equality would not get workers very far in
overturning the oppression they suffer, he believed, because it is a
merely political and formal value: &ldquo;To clamour for <em>equal or
even equitable retribution</em> on the basis of the wages system is
the same as to clamour for <em>freedom</em> on the basis of the
slavery system&rdquo; (Marx 1898 [1985: 160]). But surely, the just
society is one in which some form of equality, maybe
&ldquo;real&rdquo; rather than formal, prevails? Not necessarily, Marx
thought. The communist distributive ideal is that each should receive
according to need and should contribute based on ability. This is not
strictly egalitarian in a distributive sense. Moreover, egalitarian
distributions entail the kind of redistributive state institutions
that may not exist in a communist utopia. In some respects, the
communist ideal transcends bourgeois egalitarian justice (Geras 1984;
Wood 2014). There is nonetheless no question that Marx provided some
of the sharpest tools to critique inequalities, helping disclose
exploitative relations and exposing ideology that upholds inequalities
(D. Williams 2024). These tools have roots in previous egalitarian
thinkers and have influenced countless egalitarian writers that came
after, including both contemporary distributive egalitarianism
(especially so-called analytical marxists) and relational egalitarians
(especially their critique of exploitation, oppression, and
domination), as we will discuss in the next sections. (See also the

<h3 id="ConRacFir">1.5 Confronting Racialism with Firmin</h3>

<p>
Racialism, also known as scientific racism, refers to the
pseudo-scientific study of human races that originated in seventeenth
and eighteenth-century human biology and proliferated in the
nineteenth century. Natural anthropologists measured and weighed
skulls, bones, and brains to generate data that supposedly backed the
thesis of the natural inequality of human races. They spent their time
proving and reproving, one bone at a time, that educated white men
like themselves were biologically superior to non-white men (as well
as to women and lower classes). Scientific racism was hugely
influential politically, from the justification of chattel slavery to
anti-miscegenation laws, colonialism, Nazism, and South African
Apartheid. It endowed racist claims with scientific authority and
served to dismiss the nascent thesis of the universal moral equality
of humans as mere religious or ethical dogma without scientific
foundation (Gould 1996). Modern science has now firmly disproven the
thesis of the biological inequality of human races (and the existence
of biological races). But even before the emergence of genetics, a
contemporary of the skull measurers was able to shed light on the
misguidedness of natural anthropology (Lindqvist 1995 [1997]). In
<em>De l&rsquo;&Eacute;galit&eacute; des Races Humaines</em>, written
in 1885, Haitian-born politician and scientist Ant&eacute;nor Firmin
had already exposed natural anthropology as an unreliable source of
knowledge. He noticed that the scientists were working in reverse:
starting from the conclusion they believed to be true (the natural
inequality thesis), selecting data that confirmed it, and offering ad
hoc explanations whenever they encountered anomalies (or, on occasion,
manipulating or misreporting the data). Firmin spent some time in the
Paris School of Anthropology with these scientists. He narrates the
absurdity of his experience observing White scientists measuring Black
brains and demonstrating the natural inferiority of the Black race,
then looking up at the perfectly competent Black scientist next to
them, half-jokingly stating that he must have some White ancestors. In
addition to uncovering the skull measurers&rsquo; scientific
shortcomings, Firmin laid the ground for the visionary thesis that
there could be no scientific basis for the concept of human races. In
a Douglassian fashion, he denaturalized social inequalities, arguing
that oppressors construct the brutes they pretend to discover in
nature (Firmin 1885 [2002: 361]). He understood the pseudo-scientific
doctrine of racial inequality as a tool of exploitation motivated by
economic gain and a desire to maintain the status quo. Equality is a
value and a desirable outcome, he believed. Ethical truths cannot be
determined through scientific measurements. Humans are not defined by
their nature: they never were and never should be. And the question of
their equal worth is too precious ethically to be left in the hands of
scientists and, ultimately, not one that they can ever grasp.</p>

<h3 id="TowModConBasEqu">1.6 Towards a Modern Conception of Basic Equality</h3>

<p>
To <em>argue for equality</em>, therefore, first meant rejecting the
<em>natural inequality thesis</em>&mdash;the view that some groups of
humans were naturally inferior to others in quality and worth such
that exploitative, oppressive, and tyrannous institutions were
justifiable on that basis. It was to affirm both (i) that most
inequalities are the product of remediable inegalitarian institutions
and practices rather than derivative of nature and (ii) that natural
variations between humans do not affect individuals&rsquo; moral worth
and provide no good basis for the subjection of some humans by others.
The positive formulation of basic equality is that persons have
universal dignity and that they are equal in their humanhood and moral
worth. Religion has historically proven a forceful ground for basic
equality: we are all created in God&rsquo;s image, and our souls have
equal worth (Waldron 2017: chapter 5). Offering a secular formulation
of basic equality has proven more challenging. Endorsing basic
equality doesn&rsquo;t mean believing that humans are equal in natural
ability, talent, potential, or virtue. But it nonetheless typically
amounts to the identification of a property that makes all human
persons (and only human persons) equals. Selecting such an attribute
is doomed to be controversial, and many egalitarians simply avoid the
discussion or condemn it as a wild-goose chase (G. Cohen 2013:
194).</p>

<p>
Plausible grounding attributes are thought to have the shape of a
<em>range property</em>: while we can differ in the degree to which we
hold it, we all hold the property (Parr &amp; Slavny 2019; Waldron
2017: chapter 3). One such property might be <em>human needs</em> and
<em>vulnerabilities</em>: our needs and vulnerabilities may differ,
but we all have them (Caney 2005: 36). Another contender may be our
capacity to reason, our <em>rational agency</em>. Relatedly,
Rawls&rsquo;s chosen range property is the capacity for <em>moral
personality</em>&mdash;that is, the combination of two moral powers:
the capacity for a conception of the good and a sense of justice. In
other words, the dual capacities for autonomy and interpersonal
morality: &ldquo;There is no race or recognized group of human beings
that lacks this attribute. Only scattered individuals are without this
capacity, or its realization to the minimum degree, and the failure to
realize it is the consequence of unjust and impoverished social
circumstances, or fortuitous contingencies&rdquo;(Rawls 1971: 506).
There are problems with each potential property. Some say too little
to be of theoretical or practical value: appealing to humanhood or
personhood, in general, may be tautological&mdash;we ought to be
treated as humans because we are human. Others seem arbitrarily
speciesist, seemingly picked specifically to exclude non-human
animals. Yet other properties are too narrow to include all humans,
excluding those who, for example, are in a comatose state or have
severe cognitive disabilities, leading to unpalatable consequences
(Arneson 1999). While not being too vague, the range property must
also contain enough to conjure the kind of normative content we want
it to ground: that we ought to be treated in robustly just ways based
on our basic equality. Picking a property finally runs the dangerous
risk of lending support to the natural inequality thesis: those who
display higher capacities with regard to the range property may be
viewed as superior to those with lower capacities, and this fact can
then be used as a justification for inegalitarian institutions
(Arneson 1999). In the historical struggle for equality, those in
power have always tended to pick traits that favor themselves and
their social group.</p>

<p>
As an alternative, Anne Phillips recently proposed to understand basic
equality as a political commitment rather than a common human feature
to be discovered in our essence (Phillips 2021; Sagar 2024).
&ldquo;Equality,&rdquo; Phillips proposes, &ldquo;is something humans
<em>make happen</em> by asserting it&rdquo; (Phillips 2021: 57). This
is reminiscent of Ant&eacute;nor Firmin&rsquo;s thought that &ldquo;to
believe in equality is to make a moral commitment to spare no effort
in order to translate that into facts and results&rdquo; (Firmin 1885
[2002: 446]). One potential issue with this alternative is that it
does not offer reasons for humans, and only humans, to be the relevant
rights-bearers: it simply states it. Andrea Sangiovanni provides some
perspective on this issue (Sangiovanni 2017). Perhaps it is okay if we
accept that no trait makes us especially worthy in the chain of
beings, and perhaps our commitment to basic equality should not be
understood as an expression of an equal &ldquo;worth&rdquo;. Rather,
we should start from the somewhat more straightforward realization
that being treated as inferiors is especially harmful to humans
(Sangiovanni 2023). This gives us strong reasons to oppose social
hierarchies without appealing to a dubious basis for equal moral
worth. Phillips and Sangiovanni jointly pave the way to an alternative
conception of why we ought to treat each other as one another&rsquo;s
equals, one which isn&rsquo;t as reliant on our scalar capacities as
humans.</p>

<p>
Attempting a middle ground between the traditional approach and its
rejection, Ian Carter proposes a complex &ldquo;opacity respect&rdquo;
view (Carter 2011). Humans command the type of respect that should
prevent us from looking too closely, in his view. Evaluating their
abilities before we decide whether they deserve to be treated as
equals is inappropriate. Carter&rsquo;s suggestion interestingly
combines a range property (human agency) with a normative injunction
(a commitment not to scrutinize and evaluate). His work inherits some
of the problems of both approaches, but it nonetheless serves as a
possible middle ground. While work is needed on the topic of basic
equality, there is a broad consensus among contemporary egalitarians
that our attention should turn to what it means to treat persons as
equals and to set up egalitarian institutions, rather than to what
makes us one another&rsquo;s equals. It will nonetheless sometimes be
helpful to assess the extent to which an author&rsquo;s perspective on
basic equality impacts her substantive conception of equality itself
(Carter 2011).</p>

<h2 id="RawLibEga">2. Rawlsian Liberal Egalitarianism</h2>

<p>
In his field-shaping 1971 book <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, John
Rawls offered a systematic account of what a society that truly honors
our status as moral equals should look like. Utilitarianism had been
the dominant theory for more than a century. It alleges that a just
society must maximize utility across persons. Utilitarianism values
basic equality in its own way: no one&rsquo;s utility matters more
than that of another. We ought to structure institutions to secure the
greatest amount of overall happiness, regardless of how utility is
distributed between persons. Utilitarians would thus prefer
<em>Society 1</em> in which Anna has 1 utility point and Bob 100 to
<em>Society 2</em> in which Anna and Bob have 20 utility points each
since the total sum of utility is higher in Society 1 (101) than in
Society 2 (40). Rawls accused utilitarians of failing to take
seriously <em>the separateness of persons</em> (Rawls 1971:
26&ndash;27). To truly honor our status as moral equals, it
isn&rsquo;t enough to value utility across persons, we must also
design institutions that support individuals&rsquo; reasonable
aspirations as free and equal persons. (See also the entry on
 <a href="../rawls/">Rawls</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="VeiIgn">2.1 The Veil of Ignorance</h3>

<p>
What would social arrangements that distribute benefits and burdens
fairly between individuals look like exactly? An immediate problem
when debating what a just society looks like is that individuals tend
to be partial. The wealthy will likely argue in favor of a scheme of
justice that allows them to keep their wealth, for instance. They may
portray the contingent condition of the propertyless as an expression
of their inferior talent or merit and justify a limited access to
societal positions and advantages on that basis. To determine what a
just society truly looks like, we must instead turn to a different
question: what terms of cooperation would rational deliberators who
did not know what place in society they occupy come up with? Rawls
developed a heuristic device called the <em>veil of ignorance</em> to
help us establish unbiased governing principles for a just
society.</p>

<p>
Rawls imagined a gathering of parties placed behind a veil of
ignorance (in the <em>original position</em>). The parties ignore
their social class or status, race or gender, their particular talents
and abilities, their specific conception of the good life, and their
individual psychology. Rawls&rsquo;s belief was that a fair society
can only be established from an impartial perspective&mdash;one in
which morally irrelevant differences in social circumstances at birth
do not affect the distribution of burdens and benefits. A fair society
is one in which the position of the least well-off is
<em>maximized</em>: the worse-off cannot point to an alternative
arrangement in which they would be better off. For Rawls, this
logically follows from impartiality: the parties behind the veil of
ignorance would want to reduce the obstacles and barriers faced by the
worst-off, just in case they turned out to find themselves in that
position once the veil is lifted. Rawls thought of the veil of
ignorance as a method of egalitarian argumentation. It isn&rsquo;t of
course a literal recommendation that we rid ourselves of our
connection to our worldly selves (Rawls 1971: 120; Freeman 2007: 144).
We are constrained by our experiences, our partiality, and our biases.
The egalitarian thrust of the veil of ignorance lies in reminding us
that questions of justice can only be settled fairly when we adopt the
perspective of our fellow citizens, especially those who are
disadvantaged by current social institutions. Importantly, the veil of
ignorance also protects <em>liberal neutrality</em>: it is focused on
the establishment of terms of cooperation acceptable to all
individuals regardless of their own beliefs about what a good life
looks like (Quong 2011). (See also the entry on the
 <a href="../original-position/">original position</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="EgaPri">2.2 Egalitarian Principles</h3>

<p>
Rawls proposed a set of lexically ordered egalitarian principles he
believed his ideally situated agents behind a veil of ignorance would
come to. These principles honor the general egalitarian presumption
underlying Rawls&rsquo;s theory: when it comes to important goods we
all care about, the default should be that they should be distributed
equally; when it comes to social inequalities, the default is that
they are only allowed if they improve the position of the least well
off (Rawls 1971: 62; Lovett 2011: 47).</p>

<h4 id="EquBasLib">2.2.1 Equal Basic Liberties</h4>

<p>
First, the parties behind the veil of ignorance would want to secure
an <em>equal set of basic liberties</em>: &ldquo;each person is to
have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal basic
liberties compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for
others.&rdquo; (Rawls 1999: 53). This basic scheme of liberties is
meant to include a comprehensive set of freedoms, familiar from the
constitution of liberal democracies: political liberties, liberty of
conscience and freedom of association, freedom and integrity of the
person, and the rights covered by the rule of law (Rawls 1971: 61;
2001: 114). Why would the parties choose the liberty principle behind
the veil of ignorance? They want to secure their abilities to
influence politics and develop and pursue a conception of the good,
<em>no matter what</em> their political beliefs and conception of the
good contain. Through a secure and extensive set of rights, the
liberty principle protects citizens against majority tyranny and
against being sacrificed for the greater good. It takes
utilitarianism&rsquo;s greatest blind spot seriously: acknowledging
that each person&rsquo;s life is of separate and distinct importance.
And it seamlessly incorporates the insights of liberalism within an
egalitarian framework. Departing from the caricature of a perpetual
conflict between freedom and equality, Rawls conceptualized the two
values as co-extensive and co-dependent notions, solidly grounding
liberal egalitarianism.</p>

<h4 id="FaiEquOpp">2.2.2 Fair Equality of Opportunity</h4>

<p>
Second, the parties behind the veil of ignorance would recommend the
promotion of <em>fair equality of opportunity:</em> social and
economic inequalities &ldquo;are to be attached to positions and
offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of
opportunity&rdquo; (Rawls 1971: 42&ndash;43). Merely securing liberty
rights would not be enough. After all, a life of basic liberty would
still be subject to the vagaries of social circumstances. The
socio-economic circumstances under which people grow up, that is, are
still likely to greatly shape their prospects: their income and
wealth, their job opportunities, whether they attend university, etc.
The parties behind the veil would want to ensure that the paths to
acquiring important social goods like income, opportunities, and
social status, are equally open to them even if they are not born into
a wealthy family. For Rawls, there is nothing <em>natural</em> or
morally justified about the unequal opportunities facing people from
different social backgrounds in most societies. Instead, these
inequalities are the product of practices and policies that unfairly
advantage some over others. What we must do is establish societies
that unfairly advantage no one. A society in which &ldquo;those who
are at the same level of talent and ability, and have the same
willingness to use them, should have the same prospects of
success&rdquo; regardless of their social background (Rawls 1971: 73).
A just society also offers developmental opportunities to make all
positions more attainable to all (see also the entry on
 <a href="../equal-opportunity/">equality of opportunity</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="DifPri">2.2.3 The Difference Principle</h4>

<p>
Third, and last, the parties behind the veil of ignorance would adopt
<em>the difference principle</em>, which states that &ldquo;social and
economic inequalities are to the greatest benefit of the least
advantaged members of society.&rdquo; (Rawls 2001: 42&ndash;43). The
difference principle is probably the most controversial principle of
the three, but central to Rawls&rsquo; theory. With the two first
principles only, society would be meritocratic: inequalities would be
a result of talents, abilities and motivation rather than social
circumstance. But these meritocratic inequalities, Rawls believes,
would still be unfair. This is because natural inequalities in talents
and abilities are as morally arbitrary as social ones: fortune in the
natural lottery is no more deserved than fortune in the social
lottery, he thought (Rawls 1971: 72&ndash;74). This is most obvious in
the case of disability. In any case, a natural attribute is often only
a misfortune or an advantage <em>arbitrarily</em> because of the way
we choose to structure institutional contexts. Not knowing what their
talents and abilities would be, the parties behind the veil would want
to ensure that lacking marketable talents (whichever those happen to
be in society) would not put them at a disadvantage. The difference
principle takes things even further in the way of impartiality by
prohibiting social and economic inequalities that do not benefit the
worst-off (or, less demandingly, prohibiting those that harm the
worst-off) (for discussion, see: van Parijs 2002; G. Cohen 2008,
chapter 4).</p>

<p>
The egalitarianism of the difference principle is demanding. Rawls
imagined that it would make everyone better off (Rawls 1971: section
13). For instance, if a talented individual would only choose to
become a surgeon if their wage was 3<em>X</em> rather than <em>X</em>,
and if there weren&rsquo;t enough people willing to be a surgeon for
less than 3<em>X</em>, then the higher pay for surgeons and the
resulting wage inequality would be justified, since it is thought that
everyone, including the worst off, would benefit from having access to
surgeons. With the difference principle, Rawls sought to avoid a
caricatural egalitarianism in which the better off are &ldquo;leveled
down&rdquo; for the sake of equality. He sought to give (market)
efficiency a prominent egalitarian place. But the flipside of the
difference principle is that even large socio-economic inequalities
can, in principle, be defended if a reasonable argument can be made
that they are to the advantage of the worse off. If the talented are
not ethically minded, there is a risk they could exploit their
privileged position to demand unfairly high compensation (G. Cohen
2008). Rawls restricted his attention to circumstances of full
compliance, and his principles were lexically ordered such that the
first two principles would already forbid large inequalities. But the
difference principle still legitimizes socio-economic inequalities
that later egalitarians were not comfortable with. There are also some
ambiguities in how the difference principle is to be applied. For
example, while Rawls&rsquo;s argument leans heavily on considerations
of moral arbitrariness in our social and natural circumstances, this
idea is not borne out entirely in the difference principle, critics
hold. In particular, they admonish Rawls&rsquo; failure to distinguish
between individual members of the group of least advantaged who are
badly off merely due to misfortune and ones who are badly off because
they have made imprudent choices, risky investments, or failed
gambles. Should both count equally among the &ldquo;least
advantaged&rdquo;? Among other issues, these questions and criticisms
are taken up by distributive egalitarians that followed in the wake of
Rawls&rsquo;s visionary ideas.</p>

<h2 id="DisEga">3. Distributive Egalitarianism</h2>

<p>
It is commonplace and intuitive to study inequality through the prism
of distributions. Inequalities occur when some have less than others,
and equality is reached when parties have equal amounts of some good.
This is the core idea of distributive egalitarianism, a family of
views that have dominated egalitarian theories of justice after Rawls.
There is a sense in which Rawls&rsquo;s complex egalitarianism
contained the seeds of the two dominant forms of egalitarianism that
came after it (both distributive egalitarianism, discussed in this
section, and relational egalitarianism, discussed in the following
section) (Anderson 1999; Scheffler 2003; G. Cohen 2008: 11&ndash;17).
In fact, there is a sense in which Rawls&rsquo;s theory was
distributive <em>and</em> relational. Distributive egalitarians built
specifically on the Rawlsian injunction to distribute the benefits and
burdens of social cooperation fairly. They sought to amplify aspects
that were muted in Rawls&rsquo;s theory and paid attention to a
broader set of internal and external endowments to compare relative
&ldquo;holdings&rdquo;. One challenge they faced, <em>the currency
challenge</em> (also referred to as the &ldquo;Equality of
what?&rdquo; question) was to identify the goods we care most about
(Sen 1979; Dworkin 1981a; 1981b; Arneson 1989; G. Cohen 1989). Our
distributions must genuinely reflect what individuals have reason to
value in a way that does not disadvantage some unfairly. Another
challenge they faced, <em>the responsibility challenge</em>, concerned
how far to take the injunction to neutralize circumstances beyond our
control, including the effects of natural and social lotteries, and
the extent to which personal ambitions and responsibility give rise to
acceptable inequalities. (See also the entries on
 <a href="../equality/">equality</a>
 and
 <a href="../justice-distributive/">distributive justice</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="EquIncWea">3.1 Equality of Income and Wealth</h3>

<p>
In everyday settings, those who argue against inequalities principally
focus on injustice and unfairness in the <em>societal allocation of
resources</em>. Standard measurements of inequality, such as
Gini-coefficients and Lorenz curves, register inequalities in income
and wealth. Class analysis, similarly, spotlights group-based
differences in income and wealth and their implications. It is not
surprising that inequalities are standardly theorized as distributions
of material goods. If persons have equal worth, as the commitment to
basic equality suggests, it follows that they should all have a fair
access to the <em>means</em> for living a good life. And income and
wealth are means to most ends in market societies. That the prospects
of children born into working-class families are increasingly outpaced
by those of children born into upper-class families is a
straightforward egalitarian concern. That a handful of men own as much
as the bottom half of the global population is similarly injurious to
morality. Income and wealth are nonetheless inadequate proxies to
capture a range of important inequalities (Sen 1999). We care about
economic goods mostly <em>instrumentally</em>, because we care about
other valuable ends like respect, opportunities, liberties, and
well-being. These goods aren&rsquo;t directly reducible to material
currency, and so focusing on inequalities in what we
<em>noninstrumentally</em> care about seems most appropriate
(Lippert-Rasmussen 2016: chapter 4). Importantly, our needs and plans
in life also differ and we require different amounts and types of
goods to live well. Some may need more than others to achieve the same
outcome, because of an illness, for instance. Others may need more
because their most important life projects require more resources. If
egalitarians are committed to the quality of each separate life, then
they have to go beyond economic goods and embrace a more
philosophically advanced currency that incorporates goods we care
about noninstrumentally and accounts for diverging needs and
aspirations.</p>

<h3 id="EquPriGoo">3.2 Equality of Primary Goods</h3>

<p>
It is helpful to go back to Rawls&rsquo;s own preferred currency since
it overcame some of the shortcomings of purely material currencies.
Rawls&rsquo;s <em>primary goods</em> are all-purpose means to a good
life, regardless of one&rsquo;s particular conception of the good.
Primary goods include income and wealth but also encompass
&ldquo;rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, [and] a sense
of one&rsquo;s own worth&rdquo; (Rawls 1971: secs 15, 67). As a
currency, primary goods are an undeniable upgrade from purely material
goods. But this currency also inherits some weaknesses from its
predecessors. Rawls underestimates the extent to which some may
struggle to convert primary goods into effective freedoms&mdash;for
example, because some buildings are inaccessible to them (Sen 1979;
Nussbaum 2006; Robeyns 2017a). Relatedly, some may need more primary
goods than others to function well&mdash;for instance, because they
need to pay for medicine or specialized equipment. These circumstances
beyond our control yield unfair inequalities in actual opportunities
that Rawls may have underestimated. This suggests, once again, that we
may want to place our emphasis on the <em>effective freedoms</em>
individuals are able to achieve, or the end states they are able to
realize, rather than on the distributive equality of the
<em>means</em> to these ends (Sen 1979: 219). Distributive theorists
following in the wake of Rawls also pointed to some more general
issues with his framework. There were concerns that Rawls&rsquo;s
proposal didn&rsquo;t really differentiate inequalities resulting from
circumstances of birth from inequalities stemming from genuine choices
made by individuals (Dworkin 2000: 116&ndash;18). It doesn&rsquo;t
matter much, for Rawls, how the worse off came to be among the worse
off. But is it unproblematic to place a surfer in Malibu who chooses
to live a frugal life as being among the worst off on the same footing
as an individual with a lifelong disability (Anderson 1999)? For the
most part, post-Rawls distributive egalitarians thought to address
these issues. These insights paved the way for a range of alternative
options, including equality of welfare, resources, capabilities, and
access to advantage.</p>

<h3 id="EquWel">3.3 Equality of Welfare</h3>

<p>
One option for distributive egalitarians is to return to the currency
embraced by utilitarians (utility, happiness, or <em>welfare</em>
often understood as preference satisfaction) and combine it with an
equality function instead of a utility function (Arneson 1989).
Welfare encompasses human ends that go beyond what money can buy. In
other words, we care about welfare noninstrumentally. In addition,
when focusing on equalizing welfare, we take into account individual
abilities and aspirations, allocating resources in a way that favors
egalitarian outcomes. Welfare egalitarians acknowledge the separate
importance of each human life and promote a society in which all lives
go equally well. So they are not vulnerable to the criticism raised by
Rawls against utilitarianism. But, as a currency of distributive
equality, welfare comes with many issues, including the problems of
<em>adaptive</em>, <em>expensive</em>, and <em>offensive</em>
preferences (Dworkin 1981a; Arneson 1990; Nussbaum 2000; G. Cohen
2004; Khader 2011). Some of us will have grown to need less than
others to be happy, adapting our preferences to meager prospects.
Others, perhaps through a privileged upbringing, may need more
resources to be content. It is hard to resist the intuition that a
distribution of resources that would grant more to those who were
raised to expect more would be unfair. This is the issue of
<em>adaptive preferences</em>: the fact that our preferences are an
adaptation to more or less fortunate circumstances causes problems for
those who want to equalize welfare as such. Even if we assume an equal
society as a background, individuals are likely to develop preferences
requiring different amounts of resources, and not just because their
levels of ability vary. For instance, some will prefer a frugal life,
while others will develop a taste for luxury. But most would find a
distribution providing more resources to some so they can splurge on
oysters and fine wine unjust (Dworkin 1981a). This is the issue of
<em>expensive</em> preferences. Lastly, not all sources of welfare are
legitimate. Some derive welfare from the misery of others, or from
furthering racist agendas. Welfare derived from these sources is
surely not one that justice should promote or seek to equalize (G.
Cohen 1989; Dworkin 2000; Arneson 1989; Lippert-Rasmussen 2013). This
is the problem of <em>offensive</em> preferences. More generally,
treating actual, realized welfare as the single metric for egalitarian
justice is questionable. It is not clear that we owe each other
happiness rather than, say, <em>opportunities for</em> happiness
(Arneson 1989). Each individual should remain partly responsible for
getting there and we should certainly not take all preferences at face
value. To overcome these issues, the currency of distributive
egalitarianism could combine preference satisfaction with resources
and opportunities provided in a particular setting, weighing
trade-offs along the way, taking into account what others want and
have, and making choices that yield morally unproblematic inequalities
in the end. That&rsquo;s a way to understand Dworkin&rsquo;s attempt
to revisit resource equality.</p>

<h3 id="EquResRev">3.4 Equality of Resources Revisited</h3>

<p>
For Ronald Dworkin, egalitarian justice recommends distributing
resources between individuals &ldquo;so that no further transfer would
leave their shares of the total resources more equal&rdquo; (Dworkin
1981a: 186). Rather than merely distributing external resources
equally, Dworkin incorporates a market mechanism into his theory to
take into account individual preferences. He proposes to stick to
resources as a currency, but in a way that reflects the diversity of
needs and aspirations found in human society.</p>

<h4 id="EquRes">3.4.1 Equalizing Resources</h4>

<p>
Rawls&rsquo;s preferred heuristic device was an original position with
veiled parties. Dworkin&rsquo;s equivalent is an auction between
shipwreck survivors arriving on an island with diverse natural
resources. To distribute resources fairly, all members are provided
with clamshells and they bid on the resources they want. Resources are
not pre-bundled since that would arbitrarily favor some preferences
over others. Individuals trade with one another, based on their
preferences and ambitions, until the distribution meets the <em>envy
test</em>: no one prefers someone else&rsquo;s bundle to their own. A
distribution that meets this envy test is equal, properly understood.
Final bundles are equal, but they are not the same. Rather, they
correspond to diverging preferences and aspirations, assumed
opportunity costs, and embraced trade-offs (Dworkin 1981b). To see
this, consider that some people are happy to work 60 hours a week
while doing so would make others miserable. These others would rather
work 30 hours a week, enjoy more leisure time, even if it means
settling for a lower salary. If we simply distributed benefits (such
as income) and burdens (such as working hours) equally (45 hours of
work for all), we would fail to take these preferences and ambitions
properly into account. And we would make everyone worse off than they
would otherwise be. Instead, Dworkin argues, the initial distribution
is just when, and only when, no member of society envies others&rsquo;
overall bundle of internal and external resources.</p>

<h4 id="EquLuc">3.4.2 Equalizing Luck</h4>

<p>
Equality of resources is achieved once the auction has been completed
and no one envies another&rsquo;s bundle of resources. But it would
not be long, Dworkin postulated, until new inequalities arose. Some
inequalities would be due to differences in preferences&mdash;some
would now want to work more than others. Other inequalities would be
due to differences in talents&mdash;some would now command a higher
salary or make more profitable deals than others. Finally, some
inequalities would be due to differences in luck&mdash;some would fall
ill, die young, or their house would burn down, while others would be
spared such misfortunes. To capture these inequalities, Dworkin
introduced the distinction between <em>option luck</em> and <em>brute
luck</em>. Option luck refers to the outcomes (positive or negative)
of deliberate and avoidable gambles while brute luck refers to the
outcomes (positive or negative) of pure chance (Lippert-Rasmussen
2001). We should compensate people for outcomes of brute luck whereas
outcomes of option luck should not be compensated for since they
result from individuals&rsquo; choices (Parr &amp; Williams 2021).
Imagine two persons who both have a plot of land. One person uses the
land to grow apples, which they sell at the local market. Another
person builds a private swimming pool, in which they float around on a
blowup banana, trading off the opportunity of earning income for the
opportunity of leisure. The apple seller ends up wealthier than the
pool floater. This inequality is not unfair, according to Dworkin,
since the distribution meets the envy test. The distribution reflects
the agency and exercises of responsibility of the two individuals. The
apple seller made the (relatively safe) gamble that using his land to
grow apples would produce a profit. It would be unfair to ask the
apple seller to now redistribute the profit they made from selling
apples and to bear some of the costs of the chosen lifestyle of the
pool floater. Imagine, however, that both people used their plot of
land to grow apples with the intention of selling them at the local
market. One ends up with an abundance of appetizing apples, earning a
great profit at the market. The other apple farmer, however, has a
meager harvest due to circumstances beyond their control. Perhaps,
their orchard is plagued by codling moths or apple scab, making the
fruit unsellable. Or, perhaps, they simply lack talent in business. In
either case, the inequality is due to brute luck (rather than option
luck). As a result, it is unfair and should be rectified. To combat
these, Dworkin proposes a complement to the auction, <em>the
hypothetical insurance market</em> (Dworkin 1981b: 296). When
confronted with brute luck, we should ask: would people have insured
themselves against such misfortune had they had the chance to do so
before it struck? If the answer is yes, the inequality should be
corrected. This is the essence of luck egalitarianism: a fair
distribution should reflect people&rsquo;s choices, not chance
(Arneson 2004; F. Cohen 2006; Stemplowska 2013; Albertsen &amp; Knight
2015; Lippert-Rasmussen 2016). It should be
&ldquo;ambition-sensitive&rdquo; but
&ldquo;endowment-insensitive&rdquo; (Dworkin 1981b) Luck
egalitarianism is one of the most influential theories of
egalitarianism of the last few decades. It has spawned a large
literature of proponents and elaborators. It has also been met by many
detractors, many of which will be introduced in the following
sections. (See also the entry on

<h3 id="EquCap">3.5 Equality of Capabilities</h3>

<p>
For capability theorists, what ultimately matters is our freedom to
achieve valuable ends (Sen 1979; Nussbaum 2009). These valuable ends
cannot be determined solely by the lights of people&rsquo;s own
evaluations. Welfarists and resourcists tend to tie their distributive
currencies to the fulfillment of people&rsquo;s preferences. But
preferences are often unreliable proxies for the achievement of
valuable ends. Minorities, oppressed groups, and victims of structural
injustice, in particular, often adjust their expectations and
preferences to their actual prospects (Sen 1995; Nussbaum 2000;
Nussbaum 2006). More fundamentally, people&rsquo;s preferences and
ambitions are determined, to a large extent, by social norms,
practices, expectations, and institutional settings. Gender norms
around child-rearing, for instance, diminish women&rsquo;s actual
capabilities to pursue a career (Nussbaum 2000; A. Williams 2002).
Granting women equal resources to men would not necessarily address
the reduced capabilities they suffer. Capability theorists argue that
even Dworkin&rsquo;s advanced resource proposal underestimates the
spectrum of obstacles that can block our path to valuable outcomes
(Sen 1990; Anderson 2010a). We should focus on eradicating systemic
barriers to the achievement of important ends of all kinds, including
by dismantling the norms that shape and sustain inegalitarian
preferences (Anderson 2014; McTernan 2014). Because of its sensitivity
to oppressive social norms and institutional arrangements, the
capability approach has been hugely influential in the theory,
practice, and economics of development. But because the capability
approach is critical of individuals&rsquo; preferences and their
subjective evaluation of their own circumstances, it has often been
criticized for being illiberally perfectionist or paternalistic
(Deneulin 2002; Carter 2014). How should we determine what constitutes
valuable ends and outcomes if not by asking people themselves what
they prefer? Some respond that paternalism can be avoided by
determining what capabilities we ought to provide one another through
a deliberative political procedure (Sen 1999). Others, most notably
Martha Nussbaum, have set out a list of cross-culturally valid
capabilities that must be secured in all societies if justice is to be
attained (Wolff &amp; de-Shalit 2007; Nussbaum 2009). Still others
have attempted a middle ground (Anderson 1999; Alkire 2005; Robeyns
2005; Nielsen &amp; Axelsen 2017). (See also the entry on
 <a href="../capability-approach/">the capability approach</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="Con">3.6 Conclusion</h3>

<p>
The debate on the currency of egalitarianism is ongoing. But most
agree that whatever it is that should be distributed equally should
not be something that only matters instrumentally, like income and
wealth. Rather, it should acknowledge the importance of both means and
ends, focusing on opportunities to achieve valued aims, capabilities,
resources (understood comprehensively), or real freedom (Arneson 1989;
G. Cohen 1990; van Parijs 1995; Lippert-Rasmussen 2016). While some
praise Dworkin for sowing the seeds of luck egalitarianism by
&ldquo;incorporating within [egalitarianism] the most powerful idea in
the arsenal of the antiegalitarian right: the idea of choice and
responsibility&rdquo; (G. Cohen 1989: 933), others worry that the role
of individual responsibility should be minimized in egalitarian
justice. Another discussion centers on whether egalitarian justice
really is about distributing means and ends fairly&mdash;or, whether
the point of equality is found elsewhere. These disagreements have
fostered the emergence of distributive egalitarianism&rsquo;s greatest
contemporary rival, relational egalitarianism.</p>

<h2 id="RelEga">4. Relational Egalitarianism</h2>

<p>
Would contemporary egalitarianism look much different, Elizabeth
Anderson provocatively asked in 1999, if it had secretly been devised
by conservatives (Anderson 1999)? Anderson argued that the
distributive paradigm that dominated post-Rawlsian egalitarianism
missed the point of equality entirely. The subject matter of
egalitarian justice isn&rsquo;t an ideal distribution, she proposed.
It is not an impersonal mechanism for measuring and doling out exact
fair shares to mutually disinterested individuals. Instead,
egalitarianism is concerned with the establishment of communities
whose members stand <em>in relations of equality</em>. In this spirit,
over the past three decades, relational egalitarians have proposed
conceptualizations of equality centered on the eradication of
oppression in all its forms, relegating matters of individual
responsibility and distributive fairness to the background.</p>

<h3 id="CriDisEga">4.1 Critiquing Distributive Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Relational egalitarians level two main criticisms against the
distributive paradigm&mdash;a tendency, for Iris Marion Young,
&ldquo;to conceive social justice and distribution as coextensive
concepts&rdquo; and to think of justice as &ldquo;an ensemble of
possessive relations&rdquo; (Young 1990: 16&ndash;17). First, they
critique a propensity to focus on the downstream distribution of
material goods in a way that ignores or masks the power relations,
structures, and institutional contexts that determine distributions
upstream. Egalitarianism needs tools to bring under evaluation not
just unfair distributions but also patterns of stigmatization and
stereotyping, exploitative relations of production, and the social
norms that sustain them (Young 1990: chapter 1). Discussions of
distributive justice also often occur in abstraction from the
democratic procedures from which distributions emanate. It can seem as
though authors are under the illusion that distributive decisions can
be made in a vacuum, apart from democratic institutions and political
deliberations, and as if that would be desirable (Anderson 1999).
Second, relational egalitarians worry that some central matters of
egalitarian concern cannot be comprehended adequately from within the
logic of distribution. At one extreme, we can think of egalitarian
values like respect and recognition. These values are fundamentally
interpersonal, and are only artificially rendered as distributive
holdings. Even for non-material goods like rights and duties,
opportunities, power, and the social bases of self-respect, for which
it seems less artificial <em>prima facie</em> to adopt a distributive
frame, important aspects of the value and social meaning of these
goods are lost when conceiving of them as elements of a distributive
currency. More generally, institutions, laws, and political actors can
<em>express</em> certain intentions or messages that can be decidedly
inegalitarian: expressions of disrespect, contempt, disinterest, or
neglect (Schemmel 2021). Relational egalitarians worry that the value
and significance of these non-material goods can become distorted when
solely understood as a matter of who gets <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
(Axelsen &amp; Bidadanure 2019). Power, for instance, is not a thing
one owns or a pattern of distribution: it is a relation constructed
and sustained by an institutional context. The distributive model is
too static to adequately capture the dynamic and relational processes
that engender inequalities (and equality) (Young 1990: chapter 1). It
considers only the comparative relation between individual holdings
and ignores a range of important relations that determine and
influence inegalitarian outcomes: relations of marginalization,
exploitation, oppression, discrimination, cultural imperialism, and so
on. To make proper sense of egalitarian justice, relational
egalitarians thus argue that we must look at society&rsquo;s
injustices through a relational lens and mostly dispense with the
distributive paradigm (Young 1990: chapter 1).</p>

<h3 id="CriLucEga">4.2 Critiquing Luck Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Relational egalitarians also take issue with the split between
outcomes of unchosen circumstances (brute luck) and choices (option
luck) so central to luck egalitarian theorizing. Luck egalitarians
developed this position, in part, for strategic reasons. They sought
to incorporate into egalitarianism one of the most cherished
value-based intuitions mobilized by conservatives, i.e., that hard
work should be rewarded and imprudent choices shouldn&rsquo;t. The
caricature of egalitarianism that dominated the Cold War era was that
of a doctrine that fetishized uniformity even at the cost of leveling
down, gave everyone the same regardless of preferences, removed
incentives to hard work, and encouraged irresponsibility and laziness.
Rawls had done much already to incorporate efficiency into
egalitarianism. Luck egalitarians took on the rest of the work:
showing that egalitarianism properly understood could honor a
diversity of preferences and ambitions and hold individuals
accountable for the choices they make. This position was acutely
criticized by relational egalitarians, though, who worried it was
making egalitarianism suspiciously conservative. They leveled a range
of substantive, methodological, and political objections against this
incorporation of individual responsibility into egalitarianism. First,
luck egalitarianism seemingly asks us to think twice before
alleviating poverty or inequality. Their responsibility-sensitivity
entails that we need to find out whether people&rsquo;s hardship is an
outcome of brute luck or imprudent choices before we intervene to
rectify it (Fleurbaey 1995; Voigt 2007). For relational egalitarians,
by contrast, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much why people found themselves
among the worse off. In a Rousseauian fashion, relational egalitarians
think that a just society is one in which no one is so deprived as to
be oppressed, dominated, and marginalized, and no one is so wealthy or
powerful as to be able to oppress, dominate, and exploit others.
Conversely, neutralizing the effects of brute luck (and only brute
luck) isn&rsquo;t always important. What matters, primarily, is
securing egalitarian relationships, not ensuring those who suffer an
undeserved loss find themselves as well off as those who didn&rsquo;t.
Relational egalitarians thus reject the central premise of luck
egalitarianism, viewing individual responsibility as tangential to
egalitarian concerns (Scheffler 2005; Anderson 2010b). Second, we live
in a world whose inequalities are by and large due to unjust systems
and practices (colonialism, slavery, imperialism, exploitative trade
deals, exploitative contracts, racism, sexism, ableism, segregation,
and so on). In this context, what help is it really, relational
egalitarians have asked, to distinguish brute luck from option luck?
Perhaps the disagreement is, at least partly, methodological. Luck
egalitarians tend to operate at a higher level of abstraction and
idealization; perhaps too high for making progress on the study of
inequalities as they present themselves to us in the real world
(Anderson 2015). There is also the risk, in a political climate that
tends to demonize and blame the poor for their circumstances, that a
version of egalitarianism centered on individual responsibility could
license the often humiliating and intrusive scrutiny of the poor, for
instance of those seeking unemployment or disability benefits
(Anderson 1999; Axelsen &amp; Bidadanure 2019). For all these reasons,
relational egalitarians reject the prominence given to individual
responsibility in luck egalitarianism.</p>

<h3 id="ConIneRel">4.3 Confronting Inegalitarian Relations</h3>

<p>
Relational egalitarians often employ a <em>negative strategy</em> when
theorizing about justice. Rather than developing fully-fledged
theories of what it positively means to &ldquo;relate as
equals&rdquo;, they tend to critique pervasive practices, modes of
relating, and systems that undermine equal standing. Iris Marion
Young, for instance, theorized five faces of oppression: exploitation,
marginalization, powerlessness, violence, and cultural imperialism
(Young 1990: chapter 2). Individuals are oppressed, for Young, when
they suffer &ldquo;some inhibition of their ability to develop and
exercise their capacities and express their needs, thoughts, and
feelings&rdquo; (Young 1990: 40). Young highlighted a range of
systemic processes through which persons become dismissed, sidelined,
deprived, abused, used, or erased. Distributions remain pertinent to
relational egalitarians: large distributive inequalities can enable
oppression, and oppression often results in large distributive
imbalances (through exploitation for instance) (Schemmel 2011, 2012).
However, Young argued, focusing on oppression in all its forms offers
a more comprehensive and dynamic approach to equality. More recently,
Sophia Moreau developed a theory of <em>social subordination</em>, a
state of affairs in which &ldquo;one social group has a standing in
society as a whole that is lower than that of another social
group&rdquo; (Moreau 2020: 50). Those who are subordinated lack
sufficient power, are stereotyped, and are granted less consideration
(Moreau 2020: chapter 2). They are victims of policies that
disadvantage them amidst discursive apparati that rationalize and
legitimize inequality. Recent theories of domination (Lovett &amp;
Pettit 2018; Schemmel 2021), inferiorization (Kolodny 2023),
humiliation (Margalit 1996), exploitation (Vrousalis 2013), and
discrimination (Hellman 2008; Moreau 2020) can also be included in
this general effort to comprehend equality by studying relations of
inferiority and superiority.</p>

<p>
At the core of these critiques of oppression lies the commitment to
moral equality: we are <em>one another&rsquo;s equals,</em> have a
legitimate complaint against being cast as an inferior, and are harmed
when treated as inferiors (Sangiovanni 2017). Relational egalitarians
operate on the assumption that we are equals (Anderson 1999: 312;
Bidadanure 2021: 15). This basic fact constrains how persons ought to
treat, view, and relate to one another. It rules out treatment and
relations that fail to respect our status as moral equals and it gives
rise to interpersonal claims. Being cast as an inferior, or
<em>inferiorization</em>, can occur at different levels: one can be
<em>view</em>ed as less than an equal, <em>portrayed</em> as less than
an equal, one can be <em>related</em> to as less than an equal, and it
often follows that one is <em>treated</em> as less than an equal and
cannot <em>stand</em> as such. When people are denied the
consideration and material resources they deserve as a moral equal,
this in turn often acts as a self-justifying and self-fulfilling
prophecy, reinforcing the appearance of inferiority, which is then
used to justify oppression. A variety of inegalitarian modes of
relating are instrumental in diminishing people&rsquo;s standing, for
instance, infantilization, objectification, and animalization. They
are pervasive modes of debasement that help discount
individuals&rsquo; claims to be treated as equals. When people are
objectified, they are presented as things without boundaries, that can
be violated, used at will, owned, and discarded (Nussbaum 1995).
Infantilization denies those subjected to it their maturity as persons
(Bidadanure 2021: 105). The infantilized are treated as irrational
agents unable to take part in deliberations. Animalization, as another
example, denies a person&rsquo;s human status and diminishes the
importance of their interests. These inferiorizing modes of relating
are great barriers to equality (distributive and relational) because
they deny people&rsquo;s basic status as moral equals. The wrongness
of these modes of relating, moreover, would not be negated if they
were evenly <em>distributed</em> or <em>symmetrical</em>. A relation
in which both parties dominate, infantilize, or dehumanize each other
is not egalitarian&mdash;even though, in a sense, the two parties are
relating &ldquo;equally&rdquo; (<em>pace</em> Lippert-Rasmussen 2023,
2024). But treating one another as equals is more demanding and has
more substance than treating others the same as the way they treat
you. And a state whose institutions relate to (groups of) citizens as
inferiors, and which expresses disregard or disinterest towards their
interests, is unjust (Schemmel 2021: chapter 2).</p>

<h3 id="VarWitRelEga">4.4 Variations within Relational Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Relational egalitarians are often more clear on what they oppose than
on their positive societal ideal. Nonetheless, the most recent wave of
relational egalitarianism has further fleshed out what egalitarian
relations entail and why we should establish them. And there is
significant variation from one account to the other. First, the type
of equality emphasized varies (Nath 2020). Some focus on <em>equality
of social standing</em>, whereby community members view one another
with respect rather than looking down upon and casting each other as
inferiors (Miller 1997; Scanlon 2003, 2018; Anderson 2012; Fourie
2015; Nath 2020). For others, instead, relations are egalitarian when
they are characterized more specifically by <em>equality of
power</em>. Equality of power entails the lack of <em>dominating
relations</em> whereby some can arbitrarily interfere in the lives of
others. In other words, an egalitarian society avoids
<em>unchecked</em> power&mdash;that is, power without accountability
or democratic control (Pettit 2012; Kolodny 2014, 2023; Schemmel
2021). When some enjoy unchecked power over others, the interests of
the dominated are subordinated to those of the dominant class. For
relational egalitarians who object to hierarchies of power, worrisome
social inequalities are thus <em>political</em>: they are created and
upheld by state institutions, or they are the product of a failure of
appropriate state regulation. Private relations, relations of standing
and esteem are sometimes considered beyond the scope of justice on
these accounts (Schemmel 2012, 2015). To others, workplace
hierarchies, inegalitarian dispositions, interpersonal disrespect,
shaming, offense, and microaggressions also belong within the scope of
justice (Wolff 1998; Scheffler 2015; Anderson 2017; McTernan 2018,
2023). The question of whether to classify interpersonal relations as
a site of potential injustices evokes familiar normative concerns.
Counting some private matters as political could dangerously
overstretch the mandate of the state. On the other hand, leaving
interpersonal matters beyond the reach of politics, and beyond the
scope of justice, allows a variety of inequalities to thrive and
fester, as feminists and anti-racists have long pointed out (see
section 5.1). Finally, some develop relational egalitarianism by
modeling it on our most valuable interpersonal relations, including
friendship or marriage (Scheffler 2015: section 1.2; Viehoff 2014,
2019). In such relations, equal standing and a lack of domination are
insufficient. What is also needed is equal power to shape the
relationship and equal weight for the interests of all in communal
decisions. On accounts that seek to emulate interpersonal relations, a
society of equals is characterized by genuine feelings of care and
solidarity among members. These conceptualizations help flesh out
different versions of the positive relational egalitarian ideal.</p>

<p>
Another point of contention concerns why we should aim for relational
equality. What is it, in other words, that makes a society of equals
valuable? One obvious answer is that egalitarian relations are
valuable because they have <em>personal value</em>&mdash;they make
people&rsquo;s lives better (Tomlin 2014; Lippert-Rasmussen 2018:
chapter 6; Nath 2020). When people are dominated or related to as
inferiors, it stifles their freedom, undermines their self-respect,
compromises their flourishing, damages their self-worth, and leads to
self-censorship and self-abasement (Scanlon 2003: 212; Scheffler 2005;
O&rsquo;Neill 2008; Fourie 2012; Tomlin 2014). The value of
egalitarian relations is partly <em>instrumental</em>: egalitarian
relationships have positive consequences for wellbeing and,
conversely, inegalitarian relationships cause harm. Striving for
relational equality is an important aim insofar as it helps avoid
these serious bads. The value of egalitarian relations is also
<em>constitutive</em> of other values: there can be no freedom from
domination, for instance, without relational equality. Distributive
egalitarians, however, might object that if relations are merely
<em>personally</em> valuable, then what we really care about is
avoiding disadvantages, such as obstacles to freedom and self-respect,
and promoting certain advantages, such as self-worth and flourishing.
But this looks suspiciously distributive, rather than relational
(Lippert-Rasmussen 2018; Miklosi 2018; Schemmel 2021). Why not simply
focus on guaranteeing a fair distribution of goods that impact the
quality of relations (Cordelli 2015; Lippert-Rasmussen 2016; Gheaus
2018)? And even if the value of egalitarian relations went beyond
their personal value, we would still need to know how this value is to
be distributed across persons. Should everyone have equal access to
relations of equality or to the freedom, self-respect, and flourishing
gained through these relations? Should everyone be equally undominated
or esteemed, or just sufficiently so? (Arneson 2010; Lippert-Rasmussen
2018) Despite these potential limitations, relational egalitarianism
is still a considerable departure from traditional goods-focused
distributive views. Trying to capture relational value entirely as a
fair distribution of goods is, at best, awkward and, at worst,
impossible (Axelsen &amp; Bidadanure 2019). Suggesting, for example,
that we need to distribute X amount of non-domination fairly seems
artificial, not least because many such values are
<em>interpersonal</em>: it matters, not only that some persons are
dominated, but also that some are dominating. The value of relational
equality goes beyond that which can be captured in terms of
distributive fairness (and <em>vice versa</em>).</p>

<p>
In any case, some relational egalitarians argue that egalitarian
relations also have <em>impersonal value</em>&mdash;i.e., relational
equality can be valuable independently of how it affects individual
persons (O&rsquo;Neill 2008; Tomlin 2014; Elford 2017;
Lippert-Rasmussen 2018; Schemmel 2021). The idea that relations could
have value independently of how they affect persons is sometimes
considered &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; (Wolff &amp; de-Shalit 2007: 6;
Tomlin 2014). But, on closer inspection, it needn&rsquo;t be: just as
groups and institutions can have intentions, attitudes, and beliefs
that are not reducible to those of its individual members, a society
can be valuable in ways that are not reducible to the value
experienced by its individual members (List &amp; Pettit 2011). When a
group of people relate to each other as equals, this has value that
goes above and beyond that which can be individualized and then
aggregated. Take the case of the infantilization of institutionalized
elderly persons. When an older person is being treated like a child
(&ldquo;how are <em>we</em> doing today&rdquo;, &ldquo;you look so
cute with your little dress&rdquo;, &ldquo;come on now, if you
don&rsquo;t behave you won&rsquo;t have dessert&rdquo;, etc.), it has
documented consequences on their wellbeing, health and even mortality
rates. But the wrongness of infantilization goes beyond these
instrumental personal harms. Even if an older person couldn&rsquo;t
recognize this behavior as disrespectful and was unaffected, the mere
fact that persons are disrespected in this way constitutes an affront
to morality (Bidadanure 2021: chapter 3; Phillips 2021: 63). Along
these lines, the value of a society of equals can be conceptualized as
a constraint, a deontic requirement, or a virtue (Anderson 2010a;
Scheffler 2015; Schemmel 2021). Persons have a claim against being
cast as inferiors and they have a claim to being treated with respect
(Wolff 1998; Anderson 1999; Scheffler 2015; Kolodny 2023). A society
in which people relate to each other in this manner, we might think,
has a value that goes beyond the beneficial consequences such
relations have for individuals.</p>

<h3 id="Con_1">4.5 Conclusion</h3>

<p>
The birth of relational egalitarianism from the critique of
distributive views and post-Rawlsian luck-egalitarianism has been a
turning point in contemporary egalitarianism. Some view it as a
re-birth of a strand of egalitarianism dating back to the earliest
writers in the republican tradition, and incorporating key notions in
more critical, Marxist, and feminist writing, while conserving a
foundation in liberal individualism. Others have also associated the
rebirth of relational egalitarianism with closer attention paid to the
rhetoric of organized groups representing the marginalized: focusing
on power, recognition, democracy, and respect (Anderson 1999, 2014;
Young 1990). The cleavage, however, between relational and
distributive views should not be overstated, nor should the
singularity of each egalitarian theory be flattened to fit the
distinction (Stemplowska 2013). In the decades since relational
egalitarianism was introduced, several hybrid accounts, which seek to
combine relational and distributive elements, have been proposed
(Wolff 2010; Moles &amp; Parr 2019; Axelsen &amp; Nielsen 2020;
Phillips 2021: chapter 4). Many more relationally-minded authors
insist on the importance of taking both distributions and fairness
seriously (Schemmel 2011, 2021; Bidadanure 2021). Many distributive
theorists have also sought to incorporate relational goods into their
frameworks more or less explicitly (Stemplowska 2011; Cordelli 2015;
Lippert-Rasmussen 2016; Gheaus 2018)&mdash;some even proposing a
relational version of luck egalitarianism (Lippert-Rasmussen 2018).
Even the fathers of luck-egalitarianism, Dworkin and Cohen, have
surprisingly relational moments in some of their works, such as
Dworkin&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of &ldquo;treating people
with equal concern and respect&rdquo; or Cohen modeling egalitarianism
on the interpersonal demands of individuals during a camping trip (G.
Cohen 2001; Dworkin 2002; Lippert-Rasmussen 2018: chapter 8).</p>

<h2 id="ResGroIne">5. Responding to Group Inequalities</h2>

<p>
Substantive egalitarianism, either distributive or relational, starts
from the premise that we are one another&rsquo;s equals. We share a
set of basic needs, vulnerabilities, and fundamental interests, and we
all count equally. It is thus unjust, as Rawls noted and
luck-egalitarians amplified, when terms of cooperation unfairly
disadvantage some individuals <em>arbitrarily</em>&mdash;based on
factors beyond their control. In the language of relational
egalitarianism, a just society is one that treats all its members as
equals, without entrenched status hierarchies. Large inequalities
patterned on group membership are problematic for all egalitarians
because they tend to reveal systemic discrimination and inequalities
of opportunity based on morally irrelevant characteristics.
Inequalities based on gender, race, or class are precisely the types
of inequalities that principles of equality in basic liberty,
opportunity, resources, welfare, capabilities, and so on, are meant to
guard against. And so, there is a sense in which both forms of
egalitarianism are well suited to address group inequalities like
these.</p>

<h3 id="ClaEga">5.1 Class Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Class, albeit more or less explicitly, has been the focus of much
egalitarian theorizing historically (see sections on Rousseau and Marx
for instance). And both distributive and relational branches of
contemporary egalitarian thought have been influenced by this history.
And yet, class analysis has not been very prominent in contemporary
egalitarianism, at least in explicit form. For Rawls, a just society
should maximize the position of the &ldquo;least advantaged&rdquo; or
&ldquo;worst off&rdquo; in society. Several critics have noted that
these notions are unduly narrow and vague (G. Cohen 2008; Sen 1992).
Looking at what contemporary egalitarians have to say about class also
exposes some of the limits of contemporary theorizing, especially by
revealing issues with the strict bifurcation between distributive and
relational views. Distributive theorists have a tendency to
conceptualize the worst off in society in ways that fail to appreciate
collective and interpersonal aspects of <em>class relations</em>
(Anderson 2010a; Fraser &amp; Honneth 2003). Conversely, theorists
focusing on identity and recognition have been criticized for making
the reverse mistake, deemphasizing material aspects of class
inequalities when one of the main areas of concern for members of
oppressed classes is that they lack resources and opportunities to
access resources (Fraser &amp; Honneth 2003: chapter 3).</p>

<p>
Fundamentally interpersonal and collective dimensions need to be
captured to make adequate sense of class inequalities (Phillips 2021:
chapter 4). For Marx, classes stand on opposite sides of relations of
domination&mdash;most prominently, capitalists are able to dominate
workers because they own the means of production such that workers
depend on them for survival. Much of contemporary egalitarian
theorizing, however, tends to individualize disadvantage. For luck
egalitarians, for example, one is entitled to compensation because of
the brute luck setbacks one suffered as an individual&mdash;be it
because of their race, disability, lack of marketable talents, or
house burning down. For capability theorists, similarly, the focus is
on <em>individual</em> freedoms, functionings, and abilities to
convert capabilities into functionings. But class has an inherently
collectivist dimension such that <em>overcoming</em> domination
requires an awareness on the part of the working class that they are
at the same end of the stick (Gramsci 1971). It requires <em>class
consciousness</em>. Individualizing disadvantages runs the risk of
sapping the strength of the vision of a united egalitarian front built
around the understanding of a common struggle. Individualizing
disadvantages, Marx might add, also runs the risk of serving to uphold
the capitalist ideology according to which individual differences
explain inequalities rather than systemic oppressive practices and
structures (Milanovi&#263; 2023; Young 1990: chapter 2).</p>

<h3 id="GenEga">5.2 Gender Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
One of the most significant feminist critiques of liberal
egalitarianism concerns its treatment of the family. Liberals
generally conceptualize the family as a private sphere in which
individuals must be free to live by their conception of the good life
and transmit this vision to their children (Nussbaum 2002: 499). The
problem is that the family can also foster gender hierarchy, unequal
opportunities, and sex-based violence and humiliation (Nussbaum 2002:
500). It is a linchpin of gender injustice, the entrenched
institutionalization of sexual difference (Okin 1989: 6). &ldquo;Until
there is justice within the family&rdquo; Susan Okin argued,
&ldquo;women will not be able to gain equality in politics, at work,
or in any other sphere&rdquo; (Okin 1989: 4). Rawls rejected the
public-private distinction pervasive in much liberal theorizing.
Instead, he asserted the family&rsquo;s place as part of
society&rsquo;s basic structure. But he nonetheless underestimated its
centrality for realizing justice (Nussbaum 2002). Equality of
opportunity, for instance, is undermined by the gendered family since
it is where children first come to have a sense of themselves, what is
expected of them, and how they ought to relate to others. Some argued
that Rawls somewhat naturalized the family, conceiving of it as a
pre-political structure, which led him to uncritically embrace the
patriarchal family instead of prioritizing units or arrangements that
would better advance the aims of fairness (Okin 1989: 96&ndash;97,
101&ndash;9, 129&ndash;33, 184&ndash;85). One clear sign of this is
that participants in the Rawlsian original position are &ldquo;heads
of families&rdquo; rather than single individuals. Rawls does little
to resist the assumption that these heads of households would be men
and becomes trapped by the classic public/private dichotomy (Okin
1989: 94&ndash;95). Nonetheless, Okin argues that a consistent and
wholehearted application of Rawls&rsquo;s principles can still
challenge gender injustice. Gina Schouten goes further than Okin and
proposes that gender egalitarian interventions in the domestic sphere
(like subsidizing gender-equal take-up of paid and caregiving labor)
can be justified even to strict adherents to liberal neutrality. How?
Well, liberals care about state neutrality with respect to conceptions
of the good, in the first instance, because they care about mutual
respect. Inegalitarian gender norms undermine mutual respect (Schouten
2019, 2023). Social institutions built on such norms undermine
reciprocal interactions, constrain choices, and frustrate essential
interests of citizenship. These provide neutral political reasons to
support intervention. Such interventions may even be <em>required</em>
by liberal neutrality. Other feminists have been less optimistic about
the prospects of a liberal society in addressing feminist concerns.
Carole Pateman notably argued that social contract theory is deeply
skewed towards patriarchy (Pateman 1988; see also Chambers 2017). A
sexual contract between men precedes the social contract. This
inegalitarian contract arranges for the subordination of women&rsquo;s
interests under the illusion of equality and freedom for all presented
by the social contract. When the sexual contract is repressed,
ignored, and relegated to the private sphere, it supports patriarchy
rather than challenging it. It sanctions an aristocracy of labor in
which women are subjects (Pateman 1988: 139). This critical tradition
is more suspicious of the possibility of meaningful egalitarian
contractualism that can serve feminist ends.</p>

<p>
One aspect that was overlooked by the liberal egalitarian tradition is
the intersection of gender with other forms of marginalization
(associated with age, race, citizenship, ability, etc.) (hooks 1981;
Crenshaw 1989). Focusing on gender inequality from the perspective of
White womanhood has led many feminists to focus on women&rsquo;s
uncompensated domestic labor and exclusion from labor markets.
However, some of the most marginalized women experience the opposite
issue. Black women in the US, for instance, have been exploited as
workers, often doing precarious work in other people&rsquo;s homes,
and being denied the opportunity to spend time with their children in
their private domestic spheres. At the same time, the stereotype of
the virtuous stay-at-home mother was never applied to Black women.
From the Mammy, the asexual caregiver who neglects her own children,
to the trope of the welfare queen, a lazy cheater who prefers a lie-in
to hard work, Black women have been cast as inferiors and vilified as
reluctant workers and/or bad mothers (Spillers 1987; Hill Collins 1990
[2000: chapter 6]). These oppressive images have in turn been a great
barrier to the development of welfare programs for the worse off in
the US (Gilens 1999). Understanding this intersection of disadvantages
is key for addressing social inequalities in a way that doesn&rsquo;t
distort, flatten, or simplify the many faces of women&rsquo;s
exploitation and leads to a fuller appreciation of the set of policies
needed to challenge gender inequalities. What the National Welfare
Rights organization, led by Black women on welfare, demanded in the
1970s wasn&rsquo;t only the right to a good job like men, for
instance, it was also the right to stay home and raise one&rsquo;s
kids in dignity (Tillmon 1972; Nadasen 2005).</p>

<h3 id="RacEga">5.3 Race Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Black families in the US own many times less on average than White
families. Our race, like our sex at birth or the wealth of the family
we were born into, is pure brute luck. Hence, socio-economic
inequalities patterned on this unchosen circumstance are unjust. But
while distributive egalitarianism contains a robust set of conceptual
resources for opposing racial inequities, it faces some difficulties
in conceptualizing some significant issues raised by racial injustice
adequately. First, racial inequalities are the product of a history of
racial domination, segregation, exploitation, and discrimination.
Subsuming racial categorization under the raw category of brute luck,
alongside accidentally being hit by a falling tree, can obscure its
nature, manifestations, causes, and remedies. Second, a number of
pitfalls must be avoided, as epitomized by mainstream attitudes to the
American ghetto (Shelby 2016: 2&ndash;3). What Tommie Shelby calls the
&ldquo;medical model&rdquo;, for instance, in which ghetto occupants
are only viewed as a social problem in need of fixing, is dangerously
inadequate. Similarly, through the &ldquo;downgraded agency
model&rdquo;, ghetto occupants are problematically viewed as passive
victims in need of support, rather than as co-agents in the effort to
find solutions (Shelby 2016: 2&ndash;3). Looking at the issue of
racial injustice through a solely distributive lens can lead to flawed
diagnoses and solutions. These models sometimes also obscure how the
advantaged unfairly benefit from racialized injustices. Third,
confronting racial injustice requires paying attention in a
non-derivative way to patterns of representation, stereotyping and
expressive harms. It requires a conceptualization of racism and
wrongful discrimination (Shelby 2016: 34; Hill Collins 1990 [2000]).
Relational approaches to equality can cover some of these blind spots,
but contemporary egalitarianism has yet to develop complete theories
of racial equality at the level of the challenges faced. Properly
addressing racial inequalities also necessitates guidance on the
important question of how to move forward from here: the <em>non-ideal
theory</em> problem. One issue egalitarians have recently focused on
is racial residential segregation and the prospects of various
integrationist strategies (Anderson 2010b; Shelby 2016). One challenge
is to confront segregation in a way that does not place too much of a
burden on Black families, not unlike assimilationism risks placing too
much burden on immigrants (Shelby 2016, 68&ndash;75; Kim and Walton
2023).</p>

<p>
Finally, some theorists have expressed deeper doubts that contemporary
liberal egalitarians as we know it could deal with race and racism
successfully (Mills 1997, 2013). For Charles Mills, Rawls&rsquo;s
silences on race were not coincidental. They are structurally related
to the architecture of what he calls &ldquo;racial liberalism&rdquo;
(Mills 2017: 141). Mills partly blames this issue on the methodology
of ideal theory which enables theorists to ignore the ideologies of
domination rampant in the real world. Like Pateman, Mills argued that
liberalism can only be redeemed and turned into a color-conscious
anti-racist program if it confronts its past avoidance of the
realities of racism and the historical racialization of
liberalism.</p>

<h3 id="GenEga_1">5.4 Generational Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Does a general commitment to equality entail a specific commitment to
equality between millennials and baby boomers&mdash;that is, does it
entail intergenerational equality? What about inequalities between age
groups (i.e., inequality between young adults and the middle-aged)?
Both questions concern the <em>temporality</em> of egalitarian
justice. Age inequalities, first, are inequalities between age groups
existing concurrently at a given time (aka synchronic inequalities)
(Bidadanure 2021: 1&ndash;19). Distributive egalitarianism has been
dominated by a fairly common assumption which, upon inspection, yields
many difficulties: the <em>complete lives view</em>. Complete lives
egalitarianism alleges that when registering inequalities between
persons, we must pay attention to their well-being levels (or fair
share of resources) <em>over their complete lives</em>. Anna and Bob
may be unequal in their twenties, but what matters is whether they are
equal (or are expected to be equal) over the course of their whole
lives (Daniels 1988; Gosseries 2023). This view makes sense from the
perspective of distributive fairness (Bidadanure 2016). If we want to
take into account ambitions, individual responsibility, and
compensation, we need to think about equality across time rather than
at a particular slice. A distributive inequality at T2 may be the
outcome of investments or choices at T1 that make the inequality at T2
justified (Sachs 2012). And a problematic inequality at T2 may be
compensated at T3 by an expected windfall of resources. What matters
is to preserve diachronic equality between persons overall (Wagland
2012). One implication of the complete lives view, though, is that we
are left with few resources to challenge some intuitively wrongful
inequalities between young and old (McKerlie 2012). As long as those
who are young can be expected to age, and as long as generational
equality over time is granted, there is no complaint from the young
(or old) for the temporary inequality they experience. But surely,
most would think, some inequalities between age groups matter,
including ageist forms of discrimination. Here, the relational
approach provides some help (Bidadanure 2016, 2021: 85&ndash;119). We
must relate as equals and treat one another as such continuously now,
tomorrow, and over time. Relational equality is less driven towards
diachronic aggregation and provides room to challenge segregation by
age, discrimination by age, and marginalization.</p>

<p>
Generational inequalities, second, are inequalities between birth
cohorts (aka diachronic inequalities) (Bidadanure 2021: 1&ndash;19).
Complete lives equality, already introduced, also grounds a commitment
to equality between birth cohorts. The success of each of our lives
matters equally, and so it is in one respect unfair, inegalitarian, if
we end up with less or more through the pure brute luck of being born
at a given time (Barry 1999). But applying equality diachronically is
not as easy as it might seem (Meijers 2018). The more temporally
distant, the harder it is to ground egalitarian duties to future
people: they do not exist and do not have rights or interests yet, we
will never cooperate with them, they cannot reciprocate, and there is
so much uncertainty about the distant future. It may be tempting in
this context to suggest that we owe distant people <em>less than
equality</em>, and focus merely on saving <em>enough</em>, or
guaranteeing the conditions for <em>survival</em> (Karnein 2022). By
contrast, there is also a widely-held intuition that we owe future
generations (or at least the next generation) a better life than our
own, i.e. <em>more than equality.</em> But more than equality seems
supererogatory and it could even be unjust. A positive deviation from
equality for the next generation is allowed if it occurs through a
conscious decision of the upstream generation. In that case, the
inequality between G1 and G2 happens through option luck, not brute
luck, and so it is no concern that G1&lt;G2 (Bidadanure 2021: 45).
This kind of &ldquo;generational accounting&rdquo;, however, can seem
contrived. As an alternative, we could articulate intergenerational
equality in terms of respect, non-domination and non-marginalization.
It is a duty not to exploit the relational vulnerability they have
toward us by virtue of them not existing and being unable to influence
contemporary political decisions. The requirements of relational
equality with regards to generations, however, may strike some as
somewhat underspecified and, perhaps, non-committal compared to the
distributive fairness approach (Bidadanure 2016). (See also the entry

<h3 id="GloEga">5.5 Global Egalitarianism</h3>

<p>
Contemporary discussions of egalitarianism have mostly been framed as
confined to societies or states. Rawls&rsquo;s principles of justice,
debates about egalitarian currency, and the schism between relational
and distributive views were all, at least originally, conceived as
outlining what an egalitarian <em>national society</em> should look
like. Some of these egalitarian theorists were originally silent on
global justice, others articulated duties of beneficence and
humanitarianism (not of justice) at the global level, while others
proposed sufficientarian principles at the global level. But in a
world with a history of colonial exploitation, imperial domination,
and rising global inequality, why would egalitarian obligations be
confined to the state and not extend globally? One answer suggests
that it is because state institutions have a special and profound
impact on our lives. Institutions that impact people&rsquo;s
opportunities in this way require special justification. And, for the
state to be justifiable to all its subjects, its institutions must be
shaped by egalitarian principles of some kind (Rawls 1971: 7). Another
answer points to salient features of national communities, like the
presence of elaborate tax-collecting institutions, oversight over
resources, the presence of a constituted demos, and a national
political culture. Global egalitarians have tended to respond to those
seeking to limit egalitarian principles to the domestic sphere that
the global level isn&rsquo;t sufficiently different from the national
level to motivate a deep disconnect in our egalitarian commitments (J.
Cohen &amp; Sabel 2006; Abizadeh 2007; Valentini 2011a; 2014; Ypi
2011; Nath 2015). Global institutions have a relevantly similar impact
on our daily lives, especially on the lives of those who reside in
low-income countries (Beitz 1979; Wenar 2008; Casal 2011). These
institutions can actively <em>harm</em> citizens of poorer countries,
creating and maintaining circumstances of deprivation in poor states
(Pogge 2005; Wenar 2008). Others point to the existence of coercively
upheld borders which profoundly impact the lives of non-citizens by
preventing them from migrating to societies in which they would enjoy
better life prospects (Van Parijs 2017). There isn&rsquo;t a global
state, demos, or tax-collecting organization (yet) but if global
institutions have such a profound impact on our livelihoods, then they
are subject to the same justificatory requirements as state
institutions; and they need to be governed by egalitarian principles.
In any case, the absence of more advanced global institutions
isn&rsquo;t enough to deny the applicability of egalitarianism to the
global level (Valentini 2011b). Perhaps justice and equality precisely
require the establishment and development of such institutions
(Axelsen 2019; Ronzoni 2009; Ypi 2011). The brute luck of being born
in one country instead of another shouldn&rsquo;t dictate one&rsquo;s
life prospects any more than whether one is born into a wealthy family
or not, global egalitarians argue (Tan 2004; Caney 2005; Brock 2009).
After all, regardless of nationality, culture, and citizenship,
persons share a set of basic needs, vulnerabilities, and interests
(Doyal &amp; Gough 1991; Nussbaum 2000; Wolff &amp; de-Shalit 2007;
Brownlee 2020). And these commonalities, our universal humanity and
our legitimate differences, are relevantly similar to those used to
justify egalitarianism in a domestic setting (Caney 2005; Appiah
2006). (See also the entries on

<h2 id="EgaCloCom">6. Egalitarianism&rsquo;s Closest Competitors</h2>

<p>
Egalitarianism, in its contemporary form, was mostly developed in
discussion with and response to libertarianism and utilitarianism.
Egalitarians place equality, rather than freedom or utility, at the
center of their theorizing. It is the chief value, the
&ldquo;sovereign virtue&rdquo;, of a just political system (Dworkin
2000). But most egalitarians have found ways to incorporate other
values into their theorizing, turning freedom, utility,
responsibility, efficiency, community, respect, and so on, into
constitutive features of egalitarian justice. Egalitarians are also
often pluralists: although their conceptions of justice are centered
on equality, they believe that other moral values matter to justice,
sometimes even in a way that trumps egalitarian requirements. Even if,
say, taking all children away from their parents at an early age and
institutionalizing them in state-run facilities would greatly promote
equality of opportunity, the guarantee of certain fundamental liberal
rights and the respect of individuals&rsquo; core preferences and
interests trumps the egalitarian credentials of such interventions.
Most conceptions of egalitarianism have internal resources to block
such a policy without having to appeal to a moral value external to
egalitarian justice though. Egalitarianism also has some close
theoretical competitors, built around a similar set of values but
recommending different principles of justice. Presenting these
theories helps illuminate some foundations and implications of
egalitarianism.</p>

<h3 id="Pri">6.1 Prioritarianism</h3>

<p>
Imagine you could choose to benefit either the very worst-off person
in society or a member of the middle class. The egalitarian thing to
do, surely, is to benefit the worst-off, ideally raising them to the
level of their co-citizen. As Derek Parfit has pointed out, though,
another option is, seemingly, equivalently egalitarian: removing
resources from the middle-class person until they are as badly off as
the worst-off person in society, leaving the two with equal prospects
(Parfit 1997). After all, this too would get us to an equal
distribution. Intuitively, however, this <em>leveling-down</em>
solution seems objectionable. This suggests, for Parfit, that the core
intuition that grounds theories of distributive fairness is, in fact,
not equality but <em>priority</em>: that the worst-off should be given
priority when distributing societal advantages, or in other words,
that benefits matter more &ldquo;the worse off these people are&rdquo;
(Parfit 1997: 213). Leveling down is not helpful to the worse off, and
so priority is not susceptible to the same objection. The move from
equality to priority is not without costs, however. As some have
argued, prioritarianism has difficulties making sense of how our
intuitions differ in interpersonal and intrapersonal cases of
prioritization. When choosing between different possible outcomes on
behalf of several people, simply seeking to maximize utility comes
with intuitive problems. Doing so violates the separateness of
persons, as Rawls would have said. Instead, it looks more attractive
to choose the option that avoids the worst outcome&mdash;i.e., to give
priority to the worst-off. When one person chooses between two
uncertain paths, on the contrary, it is often more intuitively
compelling to make the choice that maximizes utility, rather than
giving priority to avoiding the worst outcome (Otsuka &amp; Voorhoeve
2009). And it is not clear that the move from equality to priority is
needed to survive the leveling down objection in any case. First,
leveling down can be a reasonable policy response to societal
inequalities in certain contexts (Temkin 2000). As relational
egalitarians have pointed out, many of the most important inequalities
have to do with social standing and political power. In these cases,
decreasing someone&rsquo;s power, or lowering their (superior)
standing, can seem more legitimate. More generally, many important
societal goods are <em>positional</em> or have <em>positional
aspects</em>, meaning that their value is determined by how much we
have compared to others (Brighouse &amp; Swift 2006; Nielsen &amp;
Axelsen 2017). This is true of voting rights, education, job
experience, and legal aid, for instance, whose value depends very much
on what others have. And in such cases, since no absolute value is
lost, it may be less objectionable to level down (Axelsen &amp;
Nielsen 2015; Harel Ben-Shahar 2018). If some have two votes and
others have one, for instance, ensuring everyone has one vote
<em>only</em> is a suitable intervention. Lastly, egalitarians concern
themselves with the equalization of something
worthwhile&mdash;valuable means and important ends. They can plausibly
deny that destroying such valuable means and ends to ensure equality
is in line with their most fundamental commitments (Christiano &amp;
Braynen 2008). In any case, the distance between egalitarianism and
prioritarianism should not be overstated. Both views tell us to worry
about the prospects of the worst off for the same reason: everyone
should have a fair opportunity for pursuing their conception of the
good life.</p>

<h3 id="Suf">6.2 Sufficientarianism</h3>

<p>
What matters to justice, according to sufficientarians, is not
priority or equality: it is sufficiency, i.e. that everyone has
<em>enough</em> (Anderson 2010a; Axelsen &amp; Nielsen 2015; Crisp
2003; Frankfurt 1987; Huseby 2010; Shields 2012, 2016). When faced
with a choice between benefiting the rich and the super-rich, both
prioritarians and egalitarians will tell us to benefit the rich. But,
sufficientarians argue, the right answer is to deny that either group
has a claim of justice on additional benefits (Crisp 2003). They
already have (more than) what justice requires and, therefore, they
are not in a position to make further claims on their fellow citizens.
Distributive egalitarians and prioritarians see justice as a question
of how to adjudicate between competing claims on scarce resources,
deciding whose claim is the weightier. But in the real world, many of
the claims brought before the state are made by those who already hold
a relatively large share of society&rsquo;s resources: middle-class
parents who want better schools for their already well-off children,
wealthy individuals who want tax cuts, or highly-skilled workers
demanding higher pay. These claims distract us from the real
injustices of the world, sufficientarian argue, which concern the
large majority of individuals who do not have enough to thrive and are
under duress. Theories of sufficiency are built around two related
theses. <em>The positive thesis</em> holds that it is especially
important to ensure that people are brought above a certain threshold
(Casal 2007), while the <em>negative thesis</em> holds that above this
threshold, inequalities are irrelevant from the point of view of
justice (Axelsen &amp; Nielsen 2015; Casal 2007; Huseby 2020). The
most controversial component of sufficientarianism, and the elements
around which most objections are built, is the <em>negative
thesis</em>. Critics have argued that it is difficult to imagine a
threshold that matters so much that we should give absolute priority
below it and no justice-relevant considerations above it. The
sufficiency view, in this respect, seems both arbitrary and
implausibly indifferent about inequalities above the threshold (Goodin
1987; Temkin 2003a, 2003b; Arneson 2005; Casal 2007; Knight 2022).
Sufficiency theorists, in response to these objections, have refined
their theories, incorporating elements of egalitarianism, and
suggesting for instance that, given that many goods are positional,
granting <em>enough</em> for everyone requires a range of egalitarian
interventions (Axelsen &amp; Nielsen 2015; Hupfer 2019; Huseby 2010;
Shields 2016). As with prioritarianism, however, one should not
overstate the distance between egalitarianism and sufficientarianism.
Sufficientarians, after all, hold that we should ensure everyone is
sufficiently free to lead a good life, and that we should be equally
concerned with everyone&rsquo;s ability to do so. Moreover, many
relational egalitarians are in fact sufficientarians of some kind,
since they believe that having enough is adequate for standing as an
equal or avoiding relations of domination (Anderson 1999).</p>

<h3 id="Lim">6.3 Limitarianism</h3> <!-- bib check so far -->

<p>
Limitarianism is a very recent theory that, it might be said, provides
an inverted mirror image of sufficiency: rather than focusing on those
who have <em>too little</em>, limitarianism focuses on those who have
<em>too much</em> (Axelsen &amp; Nielsen 2024; Robeyns 2017b, 2022;
Timmer 2021). Limitarianism sets a <em>limit</em> of justice on how
many resources people are allowed to hold. It is not meant as a
free-standing theory of justice&mdash;it is not enough that no one is
extremely wealthy for justice to obtain (since this could be true of a
world with great inequalities and one with desperate poverty).
Consequently, limitarianism isn&rsquo;t a competitor to egalitarianism
as much as it is a companion principle. In some sense, limitarian
scholars are mainly motivated by how extreme wealth impacts
(political) inequality and insufficiency (Robeyns 2019). This
proximity to other distributive principles has, however, also led
critics to question the distinctiveness of limitarianism (Volacu &amp;
Dumitru 2019; Halldenius 2022; Huseby 2022; Nielsen &amp; Axelsen
2022). But the core idea of limitarianism is that there is something
<em>particularly</em> troubling about a society in which some hold
extreme wealth while others have too little, and this cannot be fully
captured by equality or sufficiency. A society that allows individuals
to retain extreme wealth, adding little to nothing to their
well-being, under circumstances of injustice, sends a message of
special disrespect toward its worse-off members (Robeyns 2017b; Timmer
2021; Axelsen &amp; Nielsen forthcoming). Its distinctiveness comes
from the morally appalling set of circumstances that is the
co-existence of opulence and deprivation.</p>

<h2 id="EgaPol">7. Egalitarian policies</h2>

<h3 id="DevEgaToo">7.1 Developing an Egalitarian Toolkit</h3>

<p>
Egalitarian philosophers often focus on ideal theorizing and neglect
policy discussions. But egalitarian arguments have myriad implications
for a range of policy areas including taxation, labor markets,
workplaces, healthcare, housing, education and democratic
institutions. Egalitarians are naturally suspicious of, and usually
opposed to, large inequalities, and they implicitly or explicitly
recommend institutions that reduce or mitigate inequalities. We can
refer to these recommendations as forming the content of an
egalitarian toolbox (or toolkit) of policies which may include a
universal basic income, affirmative action and anti-discrimination
policies, a job guarantee, universal preschools, affordable housing,
universal healthcare, wealth tax, integration measures, and
reparations, to name only a few (Anderson 2008; White 2015). Although
egalitarians all reject the inegalitarian status quo, differences
within egalitarianism can lead to different approaches to what
egalitarian policy-making should look like. The chosen currency (e.g.,
welfare or resources), delineated scope (e.g., domestic or global),
extent to which a theory is starting gate or outcome oriented, or
degree to which individual responsibility is emphasized, are all
factors that can affect policy recommendations. Relational
egalitarians, for instance, are taken to advocate for both policies
that raise the floor for all, regardless of what explains
people&rsquo;s level of disadvantage, and policies that set strict
limits to wealth accumulation, regardless of how this wealth has been
accumulated&mdash;the aim being principally to undermine hierarchies
of power and esteem, and promote egalitarian relations. Luck
egalitarians, by contrast, want to honor the moral difference between
brute luck inequalities and option luck inequalities. This could shape
the way we understand fair interventions in the context of employment,
health or education (Roemer 1993; Albertsen 2024). The reduction of
health inequalities that are the result of unchosen circumstances (due
to genetic differences), for instance, may be prioritized over health
inequalities that are the result of unhealthy habits (not exercising
or smoking cigarettes), for instance (Segall 2010; Albertsen 2024).
This said, given that most significant social inequalities can be
traced back to forms of brute luck one way or another (i.e. the social
determinants of unhealthy habits), luck egalitarians could coherently
make policy recommendations that do not differ much in practice from
relational egalitarian policies.</p>

<p>
More generally, egalitarianism sheds light on the kinds of economic
systems that would be best suited to egalitarian ends. Rawls, for
instance, supported property-owning democracy over welfare capitalism
(and more straightforwardly over laissez-faire capitalism and state
socialism) (Rawls 2001: 135&ndash;140). Welfare capitalism requires
constant interventions to save the worse off from the inegalitarian
outcomes generated by capitalist markets and saps the possibility of
genuine egalitarian solidarity with the worse off by framing them as
pitiable victims of misfortune (O&rsquo;Neill &amp; Williamson 2012).
Rawls&rsquo;s property-owning democracy would distribute productive
assets and opportunities more equally to prevent the emergence of
monopolies (O&rsquo;Neill &amp; Williamson 2012). This form of
<em>pre-distribution</em> can help secure egalitarian positions from
the get-go, avoiding the need for constant corrections of
inegalitarian outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="EgaBasInc">7.2 Egalitarianism and Basic Income</h3>

<p>
There are countless policies that could be included in the egalitarian
toolkit. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is an example we single out here
as a good candidate. A cash grant given to all members of a community
without work requirements and with no strings attached, UBI would do a
great deal to build a robust floor for all to stand on (Bidadanure
2019). UBI and its close cousins (the negative income tax, cash
dividends, and guaranteed income) have a long legacy, starting with
Thomas Paine and Charles Fourier, and with illustrious proponents
since like James Meade, Milton Friedman, and Martin Luther King Jr.
Since the 1980s, political philosophers have actively debated the
moral adequacy of universal basic income mostly as an instrument of
freedom (Van Parijs 1995). Basic income grants more freedom of choice
than most traditional welfare programs which tend to be given in kind,
restricting how benefits can be spent (e.g. US food stamps or housing
vouchers), and requiring that recipients actively look for work (e.g.
UK job seekers allowance), that they work (e.g. US EITC), or, on the
contrary, that they don&rsquo;t work (e.g. disability benefits or
employment insurance). Since it is paid to everyone unconditionally, a
basic income program could be administered without requiring an
extensive set of bureaucratic processes and practices. This is
freedom-enhancing for recipients because it leaves them less
vulnerable to the intrusiveness and discretionary power of state
bureaucrats. UBI also protects liberal neutrality by not
discriminating against those who choose unproductive lifestyles (Van
Parijs 1991).</p>

<p>
There is an obvious sense in which UBI&rsquo;s potential gains for
freedom are also gains for equality. UBI helps ensure that no one is
so poor as to be dominated by others, which is a traditional promise
of egalitarianism (see section on Rousseau). Basic income promotes
exit options, bargaining power, and an increased ability to make free
choices while being less vulnerable to bureaucrats&rsquo;
discretionary power. It also promotes relational equality, equality of
welfare, and equality of opportunity, at least. A more direct and
efficient way to raise the floor would be through means-tested or
targeted benefits to the worst-off. Relational egalitarianism,
however, offers an important defense of the universal provision of
basic income: in a climate in which unemployment and benefits
recipients are stigmatized and demonized, means-tested benefits place
a target on recipients&rsquo; backs (Bidadanure 2019). UBI normalizes
public assistance instead, making it much harder to scapegoat benefits
recipients for political gain, protecting their social status and
standing. It delivers a distributive benefit without a relational
cost, in other words. There are also gender and race egalitarian
arguments for basic income. But the case on these grounds is not as
straightforward. The puzzle is to articulate how a policy that grants
cash to all (rather than exclusively to women, or racial minorities)
can be thought of as reducing gender or racial inequalities. A clear
alternative would be caregiver grants and reparations, respectively
(Schouten 2019, 2021). Basic income enables individuals to increase
caregiving time, either by reducing work hours or by taking time off
work to care for family members. It thus has an important role to play
toward the goal of recognizing, remunerating, and perhaps even
encouraging, care work. But because UBI isn&rsquo;t tied to care work
specifically either, the risk of disincentivizing women from paid
employment (an outcome that conflicts with gender egalitarianism) is
likely not as great as with caregiver grants. So, although from a
purely distributive perspective caregiver grants might fare better in
reducing gender inequalities, universal benefits could achieve the
same goal of empowering caregivers without reinforcing gender
inegalitarian social norms of care (Zelleke 2008). On the racial
justice side, there is a long history of groups like the National
Welfare Rights Organization, the Black Panther Party, and Black Lives
Matter supporting versions of basic income. UBI can help reduce the
racial wealth gap indirectly: basic income goes to everyone, but those
wealthiest would pay more into the system through progressive
taxation. Those worse off economically (including worse-off racial
minorities) would benefit disproportionately from the program. There
are advantages to this indirect form of addressing racial inequalities
as compared to more targeted programs. Countries with targeted
benefits have a history of stereotyping of benefits recipients. In the
US, these stereotypes are highly gendered and racialized. The welfare
queen stereotype, for instance, was carefully manufactured in the 80s
to undermine support for welfare, with persisting results (Hill
Collins 1990 [2000]). So, normalizing public assistance could help
undermine the racialized hierarchy of esteem that often accompanies
targeted cash programs. These are some of the many reasons UBI might
be thought of as part of the egalitarian toolkit.</p>
