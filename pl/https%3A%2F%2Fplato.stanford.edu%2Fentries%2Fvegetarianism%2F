<h1>Moral Vegetarianism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Sep 14, 2018; substantive revision Fri Oct 17, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Billions of humans eat meat. To provide it, we raise animals. We
control, hurt, and kill hundreds of millions of cattle and pigs and
tens of billions of chickens each year.</p>

<p>
To feed these animals, we raise crops. To raise crops, we deforest and
use huge quantities of water. To quench these animals, we use still
more water.</p>

<p>
In turn, these animals produce staggering amounts of waste, waste that
poisons water and soil. These animals produce staggering amounts of
greenhouse gasses.</p>

<p>
To raise these animals and produce this meat, farmers and
slaughterhouse workers labor in conditions from hard to brutal.</p>

<p>
If controlling, hurting, or killing animals is wrong or if the
production of these environmental effects or effects on people is
wrong or if consuming the meat produced is wrong, then a breathtaking
level of meat-related wrong-doing goes on daily.</p>

<p>
Many fewer than a billion humans are vegetarian, have diets excluding
meat. They are vegetarian for various reasons: because it&rsquo;s
healthy, because their parents make them be vegetarian, because they
don&rsquo;t like meat. Porphyry recommended being vegetarian since
eating meat produces pleasure and pleasure is a nail attaching
one&rsquo;s soul to one&rsquo;s body and such attachment interferes
with the intellect&rsquo;s true purpose. Porphyry had other, moral
arguments for vegetarianism, too, and some people are vegetarian on
moral grounds. Moral vegetarianism is the view that it is morally
wrong&mdash;henceforth, &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;&mdash;to eat meat.</p>

<p>
The topic of this entry is moral vegetarianism and the arguments for
it. Strikingly, most contemporary arguments for moral vegetarianism
start with premises about the wrongness of <em>producing</em> meat and
move to conclusions about the wrongness of <em>consuming</em> it. They
do not fasten on some intrinsic feature of meat and insist that
consuming things with that feature is wrong. They do not fasten on
some effect of meat-eating on the eater and insist that producing that
effect is wrong. Rather, they assert that the production of meat is
wrong, that consumption bears a certain relation to production, and
that bearing such a relation to wrongdoing is wrong. So this entry
gives significant space to food production as well as the tricky
business of connecting consumption to production.</p>

<p>
&sect;1 introduces relevant terminology and the main positions
discussed in the entry. &sect;2 explains meat production, the main
moral arguments against it, and some responses to those arguments.
That section&mdash;like the rest of the entry&mdash;homes in on
medium-sized birds and mammals. Yet sea creatures and insects are
killed in a number that dwarfs the number of land animals killed. Some
issues these killings raise are covered in &sect;3.</p>

<p>
None of the foregoing is about consuming animals. &sect;4 covers moral
arguments from premises about meat production to conclusions about
meat consumption. &sect;5 considers some extensions of the arguments
in &sect;2. It speculates about which arguments against meat
production can, if sound, be extended to show that animal product
production or even some plant production is morally wrong. Widespread
discussion of this last idea is relatively new. &sect;6 notes some
other new issues in the moral vegetarian literature.</p>

<h2 id="TermOverPosi">1. Terminology and Overview of Positions</h2>

<p>
Moral vegetarianism is opposed by moral omnivorism, the view according
to which it is permissible to consume meat (and also animal products,
plants, etc.).</p>

<p>
Moral veganism accepts moral vegetarianism and adds to it that
consuming animal products is wrong. Whereas in everyday life,
&ldquo;vegetarianism&rdquo; and &ldquo;veganism&rdquo; include claims
about what one <em>may</em> eat, in this entry, the claims are simply
about what one may not eat. They agree that animals are among those
things.</p>

<p>
In this entry, &ldquo;animals&rdquo; is used to refer to non-human
animals. For the most part, the animals discussed are the land animals
farmed for food in the West, especially cattle, chicken, and pigs.
There will be some discussion of insects and fish but none of dogs,
dolphins, or whales.</p>

<p>
Primarily, this entry concerns itself with whether moral vegetarians
are correct that <em>eating</em> meat is wrong. Secondarily&mdash;but
at greater length&mdash;it concerns itself with whether
<em>producing</em> meat is wrong.</p>

<p>
This entry concerns itself with eating in times of abundance and
abundant choices. Moral vegans need not argue that it is wrong to eat
an egg if that is the only way to save your life. Moral vegetarians
need not argue it is wrong to eat seal if that is the only food for
miles. These cases raise important issues, but the arguments in this
entry are not about them.</p>

<p>
Almost exclusively, the entry concerns itself with contemporary
arguments. Dombrowski 2004 is a short history of vegetarianism and
moral vegetarianism. Steiner 2005 and Stuart 2007 are much longer and
more thorough. Williams 2003, Kemmerer 2011, and Adamson and Edwards
2018 are wide-ranging surveys of historical traditions on animals and,
to a lesser extent, the ethics of killing and eating them. Sorabji
1993, Adamson 2012, Adamson and Ganeri 2016, Goodman 2017 (&sect;5),
Adamson and Carpenter 2018, and Adamson and Muratori 2020 are
narrower.</p>

<p>
Strikingly, many historical arguments and most contemporary arguments
against the permissibility of eating meat start with premises about
the wrongness of <em>producing</em> meat and move to conclusions about
the wrongness of <em>consuming</em> it. That is, they argue that</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
It is wrong to eat meat</p>
</div>

<p>
By first arguing that</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
It is wrong to produce meat.</p>
</div>

<p>
The claim about production is the topic of &sect;2.</p>

<h2 id="MeatProd">2. Meat Production</h2>

<p>
The vast majority of animals humans eat come from industrial animal
farms, farms distinguished by their holding large numbers of animals
at high stocking density. We raise birds and mammals this way.
Increasingly, we raise fish this way, too.</p>

<h3 id="AnimFarm">2.1 Animal Farming</h3>

<p>
Raising large numbers of animals produces huge quantities of waste,
greenhouse gas, and, generally, environmental degradation but also
enables farmers to take advantage of economies of scale. There is no
question of whether to put so many animals on pasture&mdash;there is
not enough of it. Plus, raising animals indoors, or with limited
access to the outdoors, lowers costs and provides animals with
protection from weather and predators. Yet when large numbers of
animals live indoors, they are invariably tightly packed, and raising
them close together risks the development and quick spread of disease.
To deal with this risk, farmers intensively use prophylactic
antibiotics. Tight-packing also restricts species-typical behaviors,
such as rooting (pigs) or dust-bathing (chickens), and makes it so
that animals cannot escape each other, leading to stress and to
antisocial behaviors like tail-biting in pigs or pecking in chickens.
To deal with these, farmers typically dock tails and trim beaks, and
typically (in the U.S., at least) do so without anesthesia. Animals
are bred to grow fast on a restricted amount of antibiotics, food, and
hormones, and the speed of growth saves farmers money, but this
breeding causes health problems of its own. Chickens, for example,
have been bred in such a way that their bodies become heavier than
their bones can support. This generates chronic pain. Animals are
killed young&mdash;they taste better that way&mdash;and are killed in
large-scale slaughterhouses operating at speed. Animals that farms
have no use for, e.g., male chicks on egg-laying farms, are killed at
birth or soon after. Norwood and Lusk 2011, Singer 2023, HSUS 2009
offer significantly more about the mechanics of industrial animal
farming. Harrison 1964 is a dated but still timely account of
practices. Ritchie, et al. 2023 is closer to state of the art and has
a variety of ways of visualizing animal death and suffering on
industrial farms.</p>

<p>
Raising animals industrially has produced low sticker prices. It
enables us to feed our appetite for meat.</p>

<p>
Raising animals industrially is also, in various ways, morally
fraught.</p>

<p>
Industrial animal farming raises concerns about the treatment of
animals (Harrison 1964, C. Adams 1990, and Singer 1975 are classics on
the topic; newer surveys are Engel 2015, Fischer 2018, McPherson 2018,
Crary &amp; Gruen 2022, and numerous articles in Beauchamp &amp; Frey
(eds.) 2011 and Rawlinson &amp; Ward (eds.) 2016). Among others, we
raise cattle, chickens, and pigs. Evidence from their behavior, their
brains, and their evolutionary origins, adduced in Andrews and
Mons&oacute; 2021 and its extensive bibliography, supports the view
that they have mental lives and, importantly, are sentient creatures
with likes and dislikes. Chickens and other &ldquo;birdbrains&rdquo;
have interesting mental lives. Marino 2017 collects evidence that
chickens can adopt others&rsquo; visual perspectives, communicate
deceptively, engage in arithmetic and simple logical reasoning, and
keep track of pecking orders and short increments of time. Their
personalities vary with respect to boldness, self-control, and
vigilance.</p>

<p>
We farm billions of these animals industrially each year (B&ouml;ll
Foundation 2014: 15; Ritchie, et al. 2023). We also raise a much
smaller number on freerange farms. In this entry
&ldquo;freerange&rdquo; is not used in its tightly-defined,
misleading, legal sense according to which it applies only to poultry
and simply requires &ldquo;access&rdquo; to the outdoors. Instead, in
the entry, freerange farms are farms that that let animals live
natural lives while offering some protection from predators and the
elements and some healthcare. While they involve control and early
death, these farms are designed, in part, to make animal lives go
better for them, and their design assumes that a natural life is
better, other things equal, than a non-natural life. The animal
welfare literature converges on this and also on other components of
animal well-being: having good feelings, avoiding bad ones, engaging
in species-typical behaviors, and doing so in good health with a
normally-functioning, normally-developing body (Fraser 2008:
70&ndash;71).</p>

<p>
So it is clear why industrial farming seems to do less for animal
welfare than freerange farming: The latter enables keeping animals
healthy. It enables happy states (&ldquo;positive affect&rdquo;) and
puts up some safeguards against the infliction of suffering. There is
no need, for example, to dock freerange pigs&rsquo; tails or to debeak
freerange chickens, if they have enough space to stay out of each
other&rsquo;s way. Freerange farming enables animals to socialize and
to otherwise lead reasonably natural lives. A freerange&rsquo;s
pig&rsquo;s life is in those ways better than an industrially-farmed
pig&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
Yet because freerange farming involves being outdoors, it involves
various risks: predator- and weather-related risks, for example. These
go into the well-being calculus, too.</p>

<p>
Animals in the wild are subjected to still greater predator- and
weather-related risks and have no health care. Yet they score very
highly with regard to expressing natural behavior and are under no
one&rsquo;s control. How well they do with regard to positive and
negative affect and normal growth varies from case to case. Some meat
is produced by hunting such animals. In practice, hunting involves
making animals suffer from the pain of errant shots or the terror of
being chased or wounded, but, ideally, it involves neither pain nor
confinement. Of course, either way, it involves death.</p>

<p>
Freerange farming and, especially, industrial animal farming raise
concerns about its effects on humans (Pachirat 2011). Slaughterhouses,
processing this huge number of animals at high speed, threaten injury
and death to workers. Slaughterhouse work is exploitative; those
workers are dominated (Young 1990). The work&rsquo;s distribution is
segmented by class, gender, and race (Eyal 2021). The costs of
slaughterhouse work are concentrated in a small number, its benefits
more widely distributed.</p>

<p>
Industrial meat production poses a threat to public health (Rossi
&amp; Garner 2014). It threatens to create and spread pathogens that
result from overcrowding animals with weakened immune systems. It
threatens humans and animals through the routine use of antibiotics
and attendant creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These risks
are typically not consented to because not typically even known
about.</p>

<p>
Industrial meat production directly produces waste in the form of
greenhouse gas emissions from animals as well as urine and feces.
Waste, concentrated in those quantities, can contaminate water
supplies. The B&ouml;ll Foundation (2014) estimates that farm animals
contribute between at least 6% and perhaps as much as 32% of
greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>
Industrial animal farming raises two concerns about wastefulness
(Lapp&eacute; 1971, PNAS 2013, Poore &amp; Nemeck 2018, and Hayek, et
al. 2021). One is that it uses too many resources and produces too
much waste for the amount of food it produces. The other is that
feeding humans meat typically requires producing crops, feeding them
to animals, and then eating the animals. So it typically requires more
resources and makes for more emissions than simply growing and feeding
ourselves crops.</p>

<h3 id="ScheCaseAgaiMeatProd">2.2 The Schematic Case Against Meat Production</h3>

<p>
Moral vegetarian arguments about these practices follow a pattern:
They claim that some activity (X) is wrong and then add that some
activity (Y) involves X and then add that if X is wrong and Y involves
X, then Y is wrong too. So Y is wrong.</p>

<p>
Among the candidate values of <em>X</em> are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Causing animals pain for the purpose of producing food when there
are readily available alternatives that don&rsquo;t involve causing
that pain or anything else particularly bad.</li>

<li>Killing animals for the purpose of&hellip;</li>

<li>Controlling animals&hellip;</li>

<li>Treating animals as mere tools&hellip;</li>

<li>Ontologizing animals as food&hellip;</li>

<li>Harming humans&hellip;.</li>

<li>Harming the environment&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>
And among the candidate values of <em>Y</em> are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Industrial animal farming</li>

<li>Freerange farming</li>

<li>Recreational hunting</li>
</ul>

<p>
Space is limited and cranking through many instances of the schema
would be tedious. This section attends to causing animals pain,
killing them, and harming the environment in raising them. On control,
see Francione 2009, DeGrazia 2011, and Bok 2011. On treating animals
as mere tools, see Kant&rsquo;s <em>Lectures on Ethics</em>, Korsgaard
2018, and Zamir 2007. On ontologizing, see Diamond 1978, Vialles 1987
[1994], and Gruen 2011. On harming humans, see Pachirat 2011, Anomaly
2015, and Doggett &amp; Holmes 2018.</p>

<h4 id="Suff">2.2.1 Suffering</h4>

<p>
Some moral vegetarians argue:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Causing animals pain while raising them for food when there are
readily available alternatives... is wrong.</p>

<p>
Industrial animal farming involves causing animals pain while raising
them for food when there are readily available alternatives...
Hence,</p>

<p>
Industrial animal farming is wrong.</p>

available alternatives&rdquo; is crucial. It is sometimes permissible
to cause animals pain: You painfully give your cat a shot, inoculating
her, or painfully tug your dog&rsquo;s collar, stopping him from
attacking a toddler. The first premise here has it that causing pain
is <em>im</em>permissible in certain other situations. The &ldquo;when
there are readily available alternatives&rdquo; is getting at the
point that for some people there are substitutes available that
aren&rsquo;t painful or particularly bad at all. Some of us could let
the chickens be and eat rice and kale. For some other people, there
might be no such alternatives. The first premise does not rule out
industrial animal agriculture that serves those people and so the
conclusion might be more limited than the argument states it
above.</p>

<p>
The argument says nothing about why hurting animals on industrial
animal farms is wrong. It could be that it is wrong because it would
be wrong to make <em>us</em> suffer to raise us for food and there are
no differences between us and animals that would justify making them
suffer (Singer 2023). It could, instead, be that it is wrong because
it is impious (Scruton 2004) or cruel (Hursthouse 2011).</p>

<p>
So long as we accept that animals feel, it is uncontroversial that
industrial farms do make animals suffer. No one in the contemporary
literature denies that part of the second premise, and Norwood and
Lusk go so far as to say that industrial animal agriculture is
impossible without quite a bit of pain (2011: 113).</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s not just physical suffering. Industrial farms make animals
suffer psychologically by crowding them and by depriving them of
interesting environments. Animals are bred to grow quickly on minimal
food. This selective breeding has led to a significant percentage of
meat birds walking with painful impairments (see the extensive
citations in HSUS 2009).</p>

<p>
The argument can be adapted to apply to freerange farming and hunting.
Freerange farms ideally do not hurt, but actual approximations of
freerange farms do. For one thing, animals typically go to the same
slaughterhouses as industrially-produced animals do. Both slaughter
and transport can be painful and stressful.</p>

<p>
The same goes for hunting: In the ideal, there is no pain, but,
really, hunters hit animals with non-lethal and painful shots. These
animals are often&mdash;but not always&mdash;killed for pleasure or
for food hunters do not need, food for which there are readily
available alternatives. Hunting is given short-shrift in this entry.
For more detailed discussion, see Scruton 2006b, Cerulli 2012, and
List 2018.</p>

<p>
Taken together the arguments allege that all manners of meat
production in fact produce suffering for food when we don&rsquo;t need
to do so, when there are readily available alternatives that
don&rsquo;t involve this hurting or anything particularly bad. The
arguments then allege that that justification for producing such
suffering is insufficient. Against the arguments, one might accept
that farms hurt animals but deny that it is even <em>pro tanto</em>
wrong to do so (Carruthers 1992 and 2011; Hsiao 2015a and 2015b) on
the grounds that animals lack moral status and, because of this, it is
not intrinsically wrong to hurt them (or kill or control them or treat
them like mere tools). One challenge for such views is to explain
what, if anything, is wrong with beating the life out of a pet. Like
Kant, Carruthers and Hsiao accept that it might be wrong to hurt
animals when and because doing so leads to hurting humans. The view
faces two distinct challenges (Regan 1983: Chapter 5). One is that if
the only reason it is wrong to hurt animals is because of its effects
on humans, then the only reason it is wrong to hurt a pet is because
of its effects on humans. So there is nothing wrong with beating pets
when that will have no bad effects on humans. This is hard to believe.
Another challenge for such views, addressed at some length in
Carruthers 1992 and 2011, is to explain whether and why humans with
highly limited mental lives have moral status and whether and why it
is wrong to make such humans suffer. Although it is not squarely about
this, Setiya 2018 bears on it.</p>

<h4 id="Kill">2.2.2 Killing</h4>

<p>
Consider a different argument against meat production:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Killing animals while raising them for food when there are readily
available alternatives... is wrong.</p>

<p>
Most forms of animal farming involve killing animals while raising
them for food when there are readily available alternatives...
Hence,</p>

<p>
Most forms of animal farming are wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
The second premise is straightforward and uncontroversial. All forms
of meat farming require killing animals. There is no form of farming
that involves widespread harvesting of old bodies, dead from natural
causes. Except in rare farming cases, the meat produced in the
industrialized world is meat for which there are ready alternatives.
The &ldquo;most&rdquo; concedes that some forms of animal farming
might involve killing when there are no ready alternatives.</p>

<p>
The first premise is more controversial. Among those who endorse it,
there is disagreement about why it is true. If it is true, it might be
true because killing animals wrongfully violates their rights to life
(Regan 1975). It might be true because killing animals deprives them
of lives worth living (McPherson 2015). It might be true because it
treats animals as mere tools (Korsgaard 2018). It might be true
because it interferes with animals&rsquo; exercise of their natural
capacities (Nussbaum 2023).</p>

<p>
There is disagreement about whether the first premise is true. The
&ldquo;readily available alternatives&rdquo; condition matters:
Everyone agrees that it is sometimes all things considered permissible
to kill animals, e.g., if doing so is the only way to save your
child&rsquo;s life from a surprise attack by a grizzly bear or if
doing so is the only way to prevent your pet cat from a life of
unremitting agony. Most would agree it is permissible for you to kill
animals for food when you have no alternative food. (Whether it is
permissible to kill animals in order to cull them or to preserve
biodiversity is a tricky issue that is set aside here. It&mdash;and
its connection to the permissibility of hunting&mdash;is discussed in
Scruton 2006b.) At any rate, animal farms are in the business of
killing animals simply on the grounds that we want to eat them and are
willing to pay for them even though we could, instead, eat plants.</p>

<p>
The main objection to the first premise is that animals lack the
mental lives to make killing them wrong. In the moral vegetarian
literature, some argue that the wrongness of killing animals depends
on what sort of mental life they have <em>and</em> that while animals
have a mental life that suffices for hurting them being wrong, they
lack a mental life that suffices for killing them being wrong (Belshaw
2015 endorses this; McMahan 2008 and Harman 2011 accept the first and
reject the second; Velleman 1991 endorses that animal mental lives are
such that killing them does not harm them). Animals could lack a
mental life that makes killing them wrong because it is a necessary
condition for killing a creature being wrong that that creature have
long-term goals and animals don&rsquo;t or that it is a necessary
condition that that creature have the capacity to form such goals and
animals don&rsquo;t or that it is a necessary condition that the
creature&rsquo;s life have a narrative structure and animals&rsquo;
lives don&rsquo;t or&hellip; Bradley 2015 is a reference-rich piece on
these topics.</p>

<p>
Instead, the first premise might be false and killing animals we raise
for food might be permissible because it is part of a deal, a bargain
with animals to raise them, to protect them from predators and the
elements, and to tend to them, but then, in return, to kill them.
Moreover, the bargain renders killing animals permissible (defended in
Callicott 2015 and Zangwill 2021 and described in Midgley 1983). Such
an argument might render permissible hurting animals, too, or treating
them merely as tools: that&rsquo;s the deal.</p>

<p>
Relatedly, even conceding that it is pro tanto wrong to kill animals,
it might be all things considered permissible to kill farm animals for
food even when there are ready alternatives because and when their
well-being is replaced by the well-being of a new batch of farmed
animals (T&auml;nnsj&ouml; 2016). Farms kill one batch of chickens and
then bring in a batch of chicks to raise (and then kill) next. The
total amount of well-being is fixed though the identities of the
receptacles of that well-being frequently changes.</p>

<p>
Anyone who endorses the views in the two paragraphs just above needs
to explain whether and why their reasoning applies to animals but not
humans. It would not be morally permissible to create humans on organ
farms and harvest those organs, justifying this with the claim that
these humans wouldn&rsquo;t exist if it weren&rsquo;t for the plan to
take their organs and so part of the &ldquo;deal&rdquo; is that those
humans are killed for their organs. Neither would it be morally
permissible to organ-farm humans, justifying it with the claim that
they will be replaced by other happy humans. Delon 2016 is a
reference-rich piece on such replaceability arguments.</p>

<h4 id="HarmEnvi">2.2.3 Harming the Environment</h4>

<p>
Finally, consider:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Harming the environment while producing food when there are readily
available alternatives is wrong.</p>

<p>
Industrial animal farming involves harming the environment while
producing food when there are readily available alternatives.
Hence,</p>

<p>
Industrial animal farming is wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
We could plausibly replace &ldquo;harming&rdquo; with
&ldquo;egregiously harming.&rdquo; The harms, detailed in Budolfson
2018, Hamerschlag 2011, and Ranganathan et al. 2016, are, indeed,
egregious and include deforestation, greenhouse gas emission, soil
degradation, water pollution, water and fossil fuel depletion.</p>

<p>
The argument commits to it being wrong to harm the environment.
Whether this is because those harms are instrumental in harming
sentient creatures or whether it is intrinsically wrong to harm the
environment or ecosystems or species or living creatures regardless of
sentience is left open (Carson 1962, N&aelig;ss 1973, and, for deeper
historical roots and wider contemporary branches, Mulloy &amp;
O&rsquo;Loughlin 2023).</p>

<p>
The argument does not commit to whether these harms to the environment
are necessary consequences of industrial animal farming. There are
important debates, discussed in <em>PNAS</em> 2013, about whether, and
how easily, these harms can be stripped off industrial animal
production.</p>

<p>
There is an additional important debate, discussed in Budolfson 2018,
about whether something like this argument applies to freerange animal
farming.</p>

<p>
Jamieson 2008 and Sandler 2017 are comprehensive introductions to
environmental issues. Schlottmann and Sebo 2019 is a comprehensive
introduction to environmental issues around farming.</p>

<h4 id="GeneMoraTheo">2.2.4 General Moral Theories</h4>

<p>
Nothing has been said so far about general moral theories and meat
production. There is considerable controversy about what those
theories imply about meat production. So, for example, utilitarians
agree that we are required to maximize happiness. They disagree about
which agricultural practices do so. One possibility is that because it
brings into existence many trillions of animals that, in the main,
have lives worth living and otherwise would not exist, industrial
farming maximizes happiness (T&auml;nnsj&ouml; 2016). Another is that
freerange farming maximizes happiness (Hare 1999; Crisp 1988).
Instead, it could be that no form of animal agriculture does (Singer
1975 though Singer 1999 seems to agree with Hare).</p>

<p>
Kantians agree it is wrong to treat ends in themselves merely as
means. They disagree about which agricultural practices do so. Kant
(<em>Lectures on Ethics</em>) himself claims that no farming practice
does&mdash;animals are mere means and so treating them as mere means
is fine. Some Kantians, by contrast, claim that animals are ends in
themselves and that typically animal farming treats them as mere means
and, hence, is wrong (Korsgaard 2018; Regan 1975 and 1983).</p>

<p>
Contractualists agree that it is wrong to do anything that a certain
group of people would reasonably reject. (They disagree about who is
in the group.) They disagree, too, about which agricultural practice
contractualism permits. Perhaps it permits any sort of animal farming
(Carruthers 2011; Hsiao 2015a). Perhaps it permits none (Rowlands
2009). Intermediate positions are possible.</p>

<p>
Virtue ethicists agree that it is wrong to do anything a virtuous
person would not do or would not advise. Perhaps this forbids hurting
and killing animals, so any sort of animal farming is impermissible
and so is hunting (Clark 1984; Hursthouse 2011). Instead, perhaps it
merely forbids hurting them, so freerange farming is permissible and
so is expert, pain-free hunting (Scruton 2006b).</p>

<p>
Divine command ethicists agree that it is wrong to do anything
forbidden by God. Perhaps industrial farming, at least, would be
(Halteman 2010; Scully 2002). Lipscomb (2015) seems to endorse that
freerange farming would <em>not</em> be forbidden by God. A standard
Christian view is that no form of farming would be forbidden, that
because God gave humans dominion over animals, we may treat them in
any old way. Islamic and Jewish arguments are stricter about how
animals may be treated though without ruling out even industrial
animal farming (Regenstein, et al. 2003).</p>

<p>
Rossian pluralists agree it is <em>prima facie</em> wrong to harm.
There is room for disagreement about which agricultural
practices&mdash;controlling, hurting, killing&mdash;do harm and so
room for disagreement about which farming practices are <em>prima
facie</em> wrong. Curnutt (1997) argues that the <em>prima facie</em>
wrongness of killing animals is not overridden by typical
justifications for doing so.</p>

<h2 id="FishInse">3. Sea Creatures and Insects</h2>

<p>
In addition to pork and beef, there are salmon and crickets. In
addition to lamb and chicken, there are mussels and shrimp. There is
comparatively little in the philosophical literature about insects and
sea creatures and their products, and this entry reflects that. For
some reference-rich introductions to seafood ethics, see Harris 2016
and Michaelson &amp; Reisner 2018. (Of course &ldquo;sea
creature&rdquo; and &ldquo;seafood&rdquo; should not be taken
literally. We eat animals that live in rivers and lakes as well as
seas and oceans.) For less scholarly introductions, see Braithwaite
2010 and Wallace 2004. For some discussion of insect ethics, see
Meyers 2013, Fischer 2016, and Carruthers 2007.</p>

<p>
Yet the topics of sea creatures and insects are important. The
organization Fish Count estimates that at least a trillion sea
creatures are wild-caught or farmed each year (Mood &amp; Brooke 2010,
2012, in Other Internet Resources). Globally, humans consume more than
20 kg of fish per capita annually (FAO 2016). In the US, we consume
1.5 lbs of honey per capita annually (Bee Culture 2016). Estimates of
insect consumption are less sure. The UN FAO estimates that insects
are part of the traditional diets of two billion humans though whether
they are eaten&mdash;whether those diets are adhered to&mdash;and in
what quantity is unclear (FAO 2013).</p>

<p>
Seafood is produced by farming and by fishing. Fishing techniques vary
from a person using a line on a riverbank to large trawlers pulling
nets across the ocean floor. The arguments for and against seafood
production are much like the arguments for and against meat
production: Some worry about the effects on humans of these practices.
(Some workers, for example, are enslaved on shrimpers.) Some worry
about the effects on the environment of these practices. (Some coral
reefs, for example, are destroyed by trawlers.) Some worry about the
permissibility of killing, hurting, or controlling sea creatures or
treating them merely as tools. This last worry should not be
undersold: Again, Mood and Brooke (2010, 2012, in Other Internet
Resources) estimate that between 970 <em>billion</em> and 2.7
<em>trillion</em> fish are wild-caught yearly and between 37 and 120
billion farmed fish are killed. The Shrimp Welfare Project estimates
that over 400 billion shrimp are farmed each year. If killing,
hurting, or controlling these creatures or treating them as mere tools
is wrong, then the scale of our wrongdoing with regard to sea
creatures beggars belief.</p>

<p>
Are these actions wrong? Complicating the question is that there is
significantly more doubt about which sea creatures have mental lives
at all and what those mental lives are like (Andrews and Mons&oacute;
2021 and Allen and Trestman 2016). While whether shrimp are sentient
is clearly irrelevant to the permissibility of enslaving workers who
catch them, it does matter to the permissibility of killing shrimp.
This doubt is greater still with regard to insect mental lives. In
conversation, people sometimes say that bee mental life is such that
nothing wrong is done to bees in raising them. Nothing wrong is done
to bees in killing them. Because they are not sentient, there is no
hurting them. Because of these facts about bee mental life, the
argument goes, &ldquo;taking&rdquo; their honey need be no more
morally problematic than &ldquo;taking&rdquo; apples from an apple
tree. (There is little on the environmental impact of honey production
or (human) workers and honey. So it is unclear how forceful
environment- and human-based worries about honey are.)</p>

<p>
This argument supporting honey production hinges on some empirical
claims about bee mental life. For an assessment of bee mental life,
see Chittka 2022 and Tye 2016, which argues that bees &ldquo;have a
rich perceptual consciousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;can feel some
emotions&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the most plausible hypothesis
overall&hellip;is that bees feel pain&rdquo; (2016: 158&ndash;159) and
see, too, Barron &amp; Klein 2016, which argues that insects,
generally, have a capacity for consciousness. The argument supporting
honey production might be objected to on those empirical grounds. It
might, instead, be objected to on the grounds that we are uncertain
what the mental lives of bees are like. It could be that they are much
richer than we realize. If so, killing them or taking excessive
honey&mdash;and thereby causing them significant harms&mdash;might
well be morally wrong. And, the objection continues, the costs of not
doing so, of just letting bees be, would be small. If so, caution
requires not taking any honey or killing bees or hurting them.
Arguments like this are sometimes applied to larger creatures. For
discussion of such arguments, see Guerrero 2007.</p>

<h2 id="ProdCons">4. From Production to Consumption</h2>

<p>
None of the foregoing is about consumption. The arguments thus far
have, at most, established that it is wrong to produce meat in various
ways. Assuming that some such argument is sound, how to get from the
wrongness of producing meat to the wrongness of consuming that
meat?</p>

<p>
This question is not always taken seriously. Most classics of the
moral vegetarian literature do not give much space to trying to answer
it. (C. Adams 1990 is a rare canonical vegetarian text that devotes
considerable space to consumption ethics.) Illustratively, James
Rachels writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Sometimes philosophers explain that [my argument for vegetarianism] is
unconvincing because it contains a logical gap. We are all opposed to
cruelty, they say, but it does not follow that we must become
vegetarians. It only follows that we should favor less cruel methods
of meat production. This objection is so feeble it is hard to believe
it explains resistance to the basic argument [for vegetarianism].
(2004: 74)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet if the objection is that it does not <em>follow</em> from the
wrongness of producing meat that consuming meat is wrong, then the
objection is not feeble and is clearly correct. In order to derive the
vegetarian conclusion, additional premises are needed. Rachels, it
turns out, has some, so perhaps it is best to interpret his complaint
as that it is <em>obvious</em> what the premises are, obvious how to
build the bridge the gap from production to consumption.</p>

<p>
Maybe so. But there is quite a bit of disagreement about what those
additional premises are and plausible candidates differ greatly from
one another.</p>

<h3 id="BridGap">4.1 Bridging the Gap</h3>

<p>
Consider an idea about the connection between production and
consumption according to which consumption of wrongfully-produced
goods is wrong because it produces more wrongful production. The idea
issues an argument like this:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Consuming some product (Q) produces production of some product
(R).</p>

<p>
Production of R is wrong.</p>

<p>
It is wrong to produce wrongdoing. Hence,</p>

<p>
Consuming Q is wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
Or never mind <em>actual</em> production. A closely related argument
runs:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Consuming Q <em>is reasonably expected to produce</em> production of
R.</p>

<p>
Production of R is wrong.</p>

<p>
It is wrong to do something that is reasonably expected to produce
wrongdoing. Hence,</p>

<p>
Consuming Q is wrong. (Singer 1975; Norcross 2004; Kagan 2011)</p>
</div>

<p>
(The main ideas about connecting consumption and production that
follow can&mdash;but won&rsquo;t &mdash;be put in terms of
expectation, too.)</p>

<p>
The moral vegetarian might then argue that meat is among the values of
both Q and R: consuming meat is reasonably expected to produce
production of meat. Or the moral vegetarian might argue that consuming
meat produces more normalization of bad attitudes towards animals and
that normalization is wrong. There are various possibilities.</p>

<p>
Just consider the first, the one about meat consumption producing meat
production. It is most plausible with regard to <em>buying</em>. It is
buying the wrongfully-produced good that produces more of it.
<em>Eating</em> meat produces more production, if it does, by
producing more buying. When Grandma buys the wrongfully produced
delicacy, the idea goes, she produces more wrongdoing. The company she
buys from produces more goods whether you eat the delicacy or throw it
out.</p>

<p>
Arguments like this hinge on an empirical claim about production and a
moral claim about the wrongfulness of producing wrongdoing. The moral
claim has far-reaching implications (DeGrazia 2009 and Warfield 2015).
Consider this tipping case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You order a salad at a steakhouse. You tip the server even though you
know he will use the money to buy wrongfully-produced meat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If buying wrongfully-produced meat is wrong because it produces more
wrongfully-produced meat, is it wrong to tip the server in the tipping
case? Is it wrong to buy a vegetarian meal at the steakhouse in the
first place? The steakhouse might well just take your money and use it
to buy wrongfully-produced steak. These are questions for the moral
claim about producing wrongdoing. There are further, familiar
questions about whether it is wrong to produce wrongdoing when one
neither intends to nor foresees it and whether it is wrong to produce
wrongdoing when one does not intend it but does foresee it and then
about whether what is wrong is producing wrongdoing or, rather, simply
producing a bad effect (see entries on the
 <a href="../double-effect/">doctrine of double effect</a>
 and
 <a href="../doing-allowing/">doing vs. allowing harm</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A quite different line of questioning is about the empirical claim
that consumption produces production. We might just deny it and,
instead, accepting that because the food system is so enormous, fed by
so many consumers, and so stuffed with money, believe that our eating
or buying typically has <em>no</em> effect on production, neither
directly nor even, through influencing others, indirectly (Budolfson
2015; Nefsky 2018; and Fischer 2020 endorse this; Isaacs, et al. 2024
responds). The idea is that buying a burger at, say, McDonald&rsquo;s
produces no new death nor any different treatment of live animals.
McDonald&rsquo;s will produce the same amount of meat&mdash;and raise
its animals in exactly the same way&mdash;regardless of whether one
buys a burger there. Moreover, the idea goes, one should reasonably
expect this. So even if the raising of cows for burgers is wrong, your
buying or eating one from McDonald&rsquo;s is not.</p>

<p>
Barrett and Raskoff (2023) argue that in buying that burger, you
objectionably freeride on the people who do not. A large enough group
could effect change. By refusing to join that group, you wrongfully
benefit from their labor. Maybe so. But, like the objection to which
they are responding, Barrett and Raskoff assumes that large groups of
consumers make changes to production. Even dispensing with that
assumption, there is still an important issue about consumption.
Consider the enslaved chef case, a modification of a case in McPherson
2015:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Alma runs a restaurant at which the chef is known to be held against
his will. It&rsquo;s a vanity project, and Alma will run the
restaurant in the same manner--with the same meals produced in the
same way--regardless of how many people come. In fact, Alma just burns
the money that comes in. The enslaved chef is superb; the food is
delicious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea that it is wrong to consume if doing so produces wrongdoing
does not imply it is wrong to buy food from or eat at the enslaved
chef restaurant. If you go to this restaurant, you produce no
wrongdoing. The same activities are going to happen regardless of what
you do.&nbsp;So if patronizing this restaurant is wrong,&nbsp;a
different idea needs to explain its wrongness.</p>

<p>
So consider an idea according to which consumption of wrongful goods
is wrong if and because it is a benefiting from wrongdoing (Barry
&amp; Wiens 2016). This idea can explain why it is wrong to eat at the
enslaved chef restaurant: when you enjoy a delicious meal there, you
benefit from the wrongful captivity of the chef. The idea issues an
argument like this:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Consuming some product (Q) extracts benefit from the production of
some product (R)</p>

<p>
Production of R is wrong.</p>

<p>
It is wrong to extract benefit from wrongdoing. Hence,</p>

<p>
Consuming Q is wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
Moral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of Q
(and R). Unlike the first argument, which is more plausible with
regard to buying than eating, this second argument is more plausible
with regard to eating than buying. It&rsquo;s the eating, typically,
that produces the benefit and not the buying. Unlike the first type of
argument, it does not seem to have any trouble explaining what is
wrong with eating at the enslaved chef restaurant. Unlike the first
type of argument, it doesn&rsquo;t lead to the conclusion that tipping
a server who then uses that money for wrongfully produced food is
wrong&mdash;tipping is not benefiting from wrongdoing.</p>

<p>
Like the first type of argument, the arguments that connect production
to consumption through an idea about benefit hinge on an empirical
claim and a moral claim. The empirical claim is that consuming
something benefits from its production. The moral claim is that it is
wrong to benefit from wrongdoing.</p>

<p>
The notion of benefiting, however, is obscure. Imagine you go to the
enslaved chef restaurant, have a repulsive meal, and become violently
ill afterwards. Have you benefitted from wrongdoing? If not, this
second type of argument cannot explain what is wrong with going to the
restaurant. If, instead, you have benefitted from wrongdoing, it is
hard to understand what is meant by that since the visit has left you
sicker and poorer. (Don&rsquo;t think an appeal to expected outcomes
will help. If you go to the restaurant knowing the visit will make you
sicker and poorer, what should we make of you?)</p>

<p>
Also, put so plainly, the moral claim that it is wrong to benefit from
wrongdoing seems clearly false. Consider the terror-love case, a
modification of a case Barry &amp; Wiens 2016 credits to Garrett
Cullity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A terrorist bomb grievously injures Bob and Cece. They attend a
support group for victims, fall in love, and live happily ever after,
leaving them significantly better off than they were before the
attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bob and Cece seem to benefit from wrongdoing but seem not to be doing
anything wrong by being together.</p>

<p>
One difference between the enslaved chef case and the terror love case
is that Bob and Cece do not reward the terrorists for their wrongdoing
whereas Alma&rsquo;s patrons do reward her for her wrongdoing. An idea
in the vegetarian literature is that consuming wrongfully-produced
goods is wrong because it rewards wrongdoing. The idea issues an
argument like this:</p>

<p>
Consuming some product (Q) rewards production of some product (R).</p>

<p>
Production of R is wrong.</p>

<p>
It is wrong to reward wrongdoing. Hence,</p>

<p>
Consuming Q is wrong.</p>

<p>
Hereth 2016 discusses an argument like this. Cullity 2018 discusses
some ethical issues about reward.</p>

<p>
There are some questions to ask about arguments like this, but they
are similar to questions asked about the next, more popular line of
argument. One way to handle the difference between the terror love
case and the enslaved chef case is to claim that whereas patrons of
Alma&rsquo;s restaurant <em>participate</em> in wrongdoing, Bob and
Cece, by falling in love, do not. Generally, consuming
wrongfully-produced goods is wrong because it cooperates with or
participates in or, in Hursthouse&rsquo;s phrase, is party to
wrongdoing (2011). The idea issues an argument like this:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Consuming some product (Q) participates in the production of some
product (R).</p>

<p>
Production of R is wrong.</p>

<p>
It is wrong to participate in wrongful production. Hence,</p>

<p>
Consuming Q is wrong.</p>

<p>
Kutz 2000, Lepora &amp; Goodin 2013, Boey 2016, and Shotwell 2016 all
bear on this.</p>
</div>

<p>
Moral vegetarians might then urge that meat is among the values of Q
(and R). The idea seems to as easily cover buying as eating for each
is plausibly a form of participating in wrongdoing. It has no trouble
explaining why it is wrong to patronize the enslaved chef restaurant
and does not imply it is wrong to tip a server who buys
wrongfully-produced meat&ndash;doing so is not plausibly a way to
participate in the server&rsquo;s wrongdoing. Whether or not you get
food poisoning at the enslaved chef restaurant has no moral importance
to it&ndash;you participate in wrongdoing sick as well as well. It
does not falsely imply that the Bob and Cece do wrong in benefiting
from wrongdoing&mdash;after all, their failing in love is not a way of
participating in wrongdoing.</p>

<p>
Yet it is not entirely clear what it is to participate in wrongdoing
as it is not entirely clear what it is to reward wrongdoing. It is not
entirely clear when we participate in wrongdoing or when we reward it.
There is a worry that these ideas&ndash;the idea about participating
and the idea about reward&ndash;are not bridging the gap between
production and consumption as much as drawing attention to it.</p>

<p>
Consider the Jains who commit themselves to lives without
<em>himsa</em> (violence) (Adamson &amp; Ganeri 2016). Food production
causes himsa. So Jains try to avoid eating those plants that must be
uprooted to be eaten. They try to avoid drinking untreated water,
filled with microorganisms, to minimize lives taken. Yet Jaina
monastics are supported by Jaina laypersons. The monastic can&rsquo;t
boil his own water&mdash;that would be violent&mdash;but the water
needs boiling, so he depends on a layperson to boil. He kills no
animals but receives alms, including meat, from a layperson. Is the
monastic participating in violence? Is he participating because he is
complicit in this violence? Is he part of a group that together does
wrong? When Darryl refuses to buy wrongfully-produced meat but does no
political work with regard to ending its production is he party to the
wrongful production? Does he participate in it or cooperate with its
production? Is he a member of a group that does wrong? If so, what are
the principles of group selection? Smiley 2022 canvases some possible
answers.</p>

<p>
As a matter of contingent fact, failing to protest meat production
typically is not thought in contemporary US society to exhibit
objectionable attitudes. Yet it might be that consuming certain foods
insults or otherwise disrespects creatures involved in that
food&rsquo;s production. It might be it expresses a lax or supportive
attitude towards that production. Hurka (2003) argues that virtue
requires exhibiting the right attitude towards good or evil, and so
<em>if</em> consuming exhibits an attitude towards production, it is
plausible that eating wrongfully produced foods exhibits the wrong
attitude towards them. R.M. Adams (2002) and Hill (1979) argue that
some actions exhibit or otherwise express attitudes towards wrongdoing
and that such exhibition is wrong. These ideas issue an argument like
this:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Consuming some product (Q) exhibits a certain attitude (viz., a lax or
supportive one) towards production of some product (R).</p>

<p>
Production of R is wrong.</p>

<p>
It is wrong to exhibit that attitude towards wrongdoing. Hence,</p>

<p>
Consuming Q is wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
Moral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of Q
(and R). An argument like this is discussed and criticized in Shahar
2021. It explains the wrongness of eating and buying various
goods&mdash;both are ways of exhibiting attitudes. It has no trouble
with the enslaved chef case, the tipping case, the food poisoning
case, or the terror-love case. It does hinge on an empirical claim
about exhibition&mdash;consuming certain products exhibits a certain
attitude&mdash;and then a moral claim about the impermissibility of
that exhibition. One might well wonder about both. One might well
wonder why buying meat exhibits support for that enterprise but
tipping someone who will buy that meat does not. One might well wonder
whether eating wrongfully-produced meat in secret exhibits support and
whether such an exhibition is wrong and, in turn, whether it&rsquo;s
the <em>having</em> that is really wrong or the exhibiting. One might
well wonder about what is expressed by eating wrongfully-produced
leftovers that will otherwise go to waste (Nefsky 2018) or dumpster
diving (Singer and Mason 2006). Also, there are attitudes other than
attitudes towards production to consider. Failing to offer meat to a
guest might exhibit a failure of reverence (Fan 2010). In contemporary
India, in light of the &ldquo;meat murders&rdquo; committed by Hindus
against Muslims nominally for the latter group&rsquo;s consumption of
beef, refusing to eat meat might exhibit support for religious
discrimination (Doniger 2017). In Atwood 2003, two characters dispute
whether wearing fake leather expresses support for meat-eating.</p>

<p>
The main ideas in this subsection are about producing wrongdoing,
extracting benefits from wrongdoing, rewarding wrongdoing,
participating in wrongdoing, and expressing a certain attitude towards
wrongdoing. These ideas are not mutually exclusive. Someone might make
use of a number of them. If the production of Chicken McNuggets is
wrong, for example, and if consumption of them is thereby also wrong,
it will plausibly be wrong for a variety of reasons. The explanation
of why it is wrong to consume certain goods might be quite
complex.</p>

<h3 id="AgaiBridGap">4.2 Against Bridging the Gap</h3>

<p>
We have been trying to explain why it is wrong to consume
wrongfully-produced goods. Moral vegetarians typically agree that it
is wrong to produce meat but then differ about the explanation of why
it is wrong to consume it. Yet it could be that there is nothing to
explain.</p>

<p>
It could be that there is nothing wrong with meat production.
According to views like those mentioned in &sect;2.2.1 and
&sect;2.2.2, even factory farming might do nothing wrong to animals.
Though he does not do it, there is a way of developing Setiya&rsquo;s
(2018) view so it has that consequence. That leaves open that factory
farming is <em>pro tanto</em> wrong because of its effects on people
and the environment, but perhaps it is all things considered justified
by the cheap, yummy food it produces.</p>

<p>
It could be there is nothing wrong with meat production because
certain forms of it are, in fact, morally required: freerange farming,
the idea goes, is a wonderful package deal for animals. They get good
lives, but if it weren&rsquo;t for the farming, they would not exist.
Hare (1999) and Zangwill (2021) defend this. As noted in &sect;2.2.2,
Callicott (2015) defends the weaker idea that the bargain renders
freerange farming permissible. As noted in &sect;2.2.4,
T&auml;nnsj&ouml; (2016) argues that factory farming is morally
required.</p>

<p>
It could be that certain modes of production are wrong yet consuming
their products is permissible. We might assume that there&rsquo;s only
one way to build the bridge and then argue against that sort of
building. We might, for example, assume that <em>if</em> consumption
of certain goods is wrong, then that wrongness would have to be partly
explained in terms of the wrongness of those goods&rsquo; production
and then argue that there are no sound bridges from a requirement not
to produce a food to a requirement not to consume it (Frey 1983;
Bruckner 2020; Fischer 2020; Shahar 2021). Podgorski (2020) argues
that <em>if</em> consuming is wrong only if it harms animals, then
consuming even factory-farmed meat is permissible. The producers harm
animals, sure, but the consumers do not. Views like these leave open
the possibility that consumers might be required to do
<em>something</em>&mdash;for example, work for political changes that
end the wrongful system&mdash;but permitted to eat wrongfully-produced
food. It could be, as a matter of tactics, that stopping wrongful
production permits, even requires, people to sometimes eat
wrongfully-produced meat. May and Kumar (2023) develop this idea.</p>

<p>
As &sect;4.1 discusses, skepticism about bridging the gap might derive
from the idea that if eating meat is wrong, then so, too, are various
other activities. Since the various others are permissible, then so is
the meat-eating. For example, if it is wrong to eat meat because doing
so produces more meat-production, then that seems to imply that
activities like paying rent to meat-eaters or buying salad at a
restaurant serving meat are morally wrong. They aren&rsquo;t, so it
isn&rsquo;t. For another example, if it is wrong to eat meat because
doing so benefits from wrongdoing, then that seems to imply that
activities like falling in love as a result of terrorism or profiting
from reading this entry (which, I assure you, was produced as a result
of all sorts of wrongdoing) are morally wrong. They aren&rsquo;t, so
it isn&rsquo;t. We can run similar arguments against the other
attempts to bridge the gap.</p>

<p>
Why stop at paying rent or buying salad or falling in love or reading
this entry? If the wrongness of producing and wrongness of consuming
are connected, what <em>else</em> is connected? If buying meat is
wrong because it exhibits the wrong attitude towards animals, is it
permissible to be friends with people who buy that meat&mdash;or does
this, too, evince the wrong attitudes towards animals? If killing
animals for food is wrong, is it permissible merely to abstain from
consuming them or must one do more work to stop their killing? The
implications of various arguments against consuming animals and animal
products might be far-reaching. Some will see this as an
acknowledgment that something is wrong with moral vegetarian arguments
(Mills 2019). As Gruen and Jones (2015) note, the lifestyle some such
arguments point to might not be enactable by creatures like us. Yet
they see this not as grounds for rejection of the argument but,
rather, as acknowledgment that the argument sets out an aspiration
that we can orient ourselves towards (Shotwell 2016; Halteman
2024).</p>

<p>
A different sort of argument against bridge-building comes from the
idea that eating and buying animals actually makes for a great
cultural or gustatory good (Lomasky 2013). Even if we accept that the
production of those animals is wrong, all things considered wrong, and
even if we accept that that builds a <em>pro tanto</em> case against
consuming them, it could be that the great good of consuming them
justifies doing so. It could be, relatedly, that the bad of
<em>refusing to</em> consume justifies some consumption as in a case
in which a host has labored over immorally-produced chicken for hours
and your refusing to eat it would devastate him. Yet this seems to
leave open the possibility that all sorts of awful practices might be
permissible because they are essential parts of great cultural goods.
It threatens to permit too much. Casal 2003, Kim 2015, and Holland
&amp; Linch 2017 discuss the cultural importance of meat and the moral
importance of its cultural role.</p>

<h2 id="ExteMoraVegeArguAnimProdPlan">5. Extending Moral Vegetarian Arguments: Animal Products and Plants</h2>

<p>
Moral veganism accepts moral vegetarianism, that is, it accepts that
consuming meat is wrong, and adds that consuming animal products is
wrong. Mere moral vegetarians deny this and add to moral vegetarianism
that it is permissible to consume animal products. One question moral
veganism poses to mere moral vegetarianism is whether consuming animal
products is permissible. Moral veganism also raises a question about
production: If it is wrong to produce meat on the grounds adduced in
 <a href="#MeatProd">&sect;2</a>,
 what other foods are wrongfully produced? If it is wrong to hurt
chickens for meat, isn&rsquo;t it wrong to hurt them for eggs? If it
is wrong to harm workers in the production of meat, isn&rsquo;t it
wrong to harm workers in the production of animal products? If it is
wrong to produce huge quantities of methane for meat, isn&rsquo;t it
wrong to produce it for milk?</p>

<p>
Various vegan diets raise their own moral questions: If it is wrong to
hurt chickens for meat, isn&rsquo;t it wrong to hurt mice and moles
while harvesting crops? If it is wrong to harm workers in the
production of meat, isn&rsquo;t it wrong to harm workers in the
production of tomatoes? If it is wrong to use huge quantities of water
for meat, isn&rsquo;t it wrong to use huge quantities of water for
almonds?</p>

<h3 id="AnimProd">5.1 Animal Products</h3>

<p>
As it might be that meat farming is wrong, it might be that animal
product farming is wrong for similar reasons. These reasons stem from
concerns about harms to humans, plants, animals, and the environment.
This entry will attend mostly to the second, third, and fourth.
Keller, Gray, and Harrison 2016 and Mares 2019 cover harms to workers
on dairy farms.</p>

<h4 id="Eggs">5.1.1 Eggs</h4>

<p>
Like meat birds, egg layers on industrial farms are tightly confined,
given on average a letter-sized page of space. Their beaks are seared
off. They are given a cocktail of antibiotics. Males, useless as
layers, are killed right away: crushed, dehydrated, starved,
suffocated. As they age and their laying-rate slows, females are
starved so as to force them to shed feathers and induce more laying.
They are killed within a couple years (HSUS 2009; cf. Norwood &amp;
Lusk 2011: 113&ndash;127, which rates layer hen lives as not worth
living).</p>

<p>
Freerange egg farming ideally avoids much of this. Yet it still
involves killing off young but spent hens and also baby roosters. It
often involves painful, stressful trips to industrial slaughterhouses.
So, as it is plausible that industrially and freerange farming
chickens for meat makes them suffer, so too is it plausible that
industrially and freerange farming them for eggs does. Killing raises
only slightly more complex issues, but if the case against killing
chickens for meat goes through, so, too, does the case for killing
them on egg farms.</p>

<p>
The threat to the environment, too, arises from industrial farming
itself rather than whether it produces meat or eggs. Chickens produce
greenhouse gas and waste regardless of whether they are farmed for
meat or eggs. Land is deforested to grow food for them and resources
are depleted to care for them regardless of whether they are farmed
for meat or eggs.</p>

<p>
In sum, arguments much like arguments against chicken production seem
to apply as forcefully to egg production. Arguments from premises
about harming the environment and killing and hurting chickens seem to
apply to typical egg production as they do to typical chicken
production.</p>

<h4 id="Dair">5.1.2 Dairy</h4>

<p>
Like beef cattle, dairy cows on industrial farms are tightly confined
and bereft of much stimulation. As dairy cows, however, they are
routinely impregnated and then constantly milked. Their calves are
taken from them. Males, useless as milkers, are typically turned to
veal within a matter of months. Females live for maybe five years.
(HSUS 2009; cf. Norwood &amp; Lusk 2011: 145&ndash;150).</p>

<p>
Freerange milk production does not avoid very much of this. Ideally,
it involves less pain and suffering but it typically involves forced
impregnation, separation of mother and calf, and an early death,
typically in an industrial slaughterhouse. So far as arguments against
raising cows for meat on the basis that doing so kills them and makes
them suffer are plausible, so are analogous arguments against raising
cows for dairy.</p>

<p>
The threat to the environment is also similar regardless of whether
cattle are raised for meat or milk. If arguments against raising cows
for meat on the basis that doing so harms the environment are
plausible, then so are similar arguments against raising cows for
milk. Raising cows for meat and for milk produces greenhouse gas and
waste; it deforests and depletes resources. In fact, to take just one
example, because of methane emissions, the greenhouse-gas-based case
against dairy is stronger than the greenhouse-gas-based case against
poultry and pork (Hamerschlag 2011; Ritchie, et al. 2023 is also
useful).</p>

<p>
In sum, arguments much like arguments against beef production seem to
apply as forcefully to dairy production. Arguments from premises about
killing and hurting cattle and harming the environment seem to apply
to typical dairy production as they do to typical beef production.</p>

<h3 id="Plan">5.2 Plants</h3>

<p>
As it might be that some animal and animal product farming are wrong,
it might be that some plant farming is wrong for similar reasons.
These reasons stem from concerns about humans, plants, animals, and
the environment. This entry will focus on the second, third, and
fourth. CIW 2010 and Holmes 2013 cover harms to workers on plant
farms.</p>

<h4 id="PlanThem">5.2.1 Plants Themselves</h4>

<p>
Edwina drenches Fatima&rsquo;s prized cactus in pesticides without
permission. This is uncontroversially wrongful but only
uncontroversial because the cactus is Fatima&rsquo;s. If a cactus
grows in Edwina&rsquo;s yard and, purely for fun, she drenches it in
pesticides, killing it, is that wrong? The orthodox answer is no, but
there is an unorthodox but increasingly common objection about the
treatment of plants according to which any killing of plants is at
least <em>pro tanto</em> wrongful and that treating them as mere tools
is too (Marder 2013; Stone 1972 and Goodpaster 1978 are earlier
discussions and Tinker 2015 discusses <em>much</em> earlier
discussions). One natural way to develop this thought is that it is
wrong to treat plants this way simply because of the effects on plants
themselves. An alternative is that it is wrong to treat the plants
this way simply because of its effects on the biosphere. In both
cases, we need not assume plants are sentient.</p>

<p>
The objection raises an important issue about interests. Singer,
following Porphyry and Bentham, believes that all and only sentient
creatures have interests. The challenge that Marder, et al. raise is
that plants, though not sentient, seem to do better or worse, to
flourish or founder, because they seem to have interests in a certain
amount of light, nutrients, and water. One way to interpret the
position of Porphyry, et al. is that things are not as they seem here
and, in fact, plants, lacking sentience, have no interests. This
invites the question of why sentience is necessary for interests (Frey
1980 and 1983). Another way to interpret the position of Porphyry, et
al. is that plants do have interests but they have no moral import.
This invites the questions of when and why is it permissible to
deprive plants of what they have interests in. Marder&rsquo;s view is
that plants have interests and that these interests carry
significantly more moral weight than one might think. So, for example,
as killing a dog for fun is wrong, so, too, is killing a dandelion. If
killing a chicken for food we don&rsquo;t need is wrong, so, too, is
killing some carrots. Yoon (2011) worries that if eating that chicken
is wrong, so, too, is eating the carrot.</p>

<p>
If it is impermissible to kill plants to provide ourselves food we
don&rsquo;t need, how far does the restriction on killing extend: To
bacteria? Pressed about this by Gary Francione, Marder is open-minded:
&ldquo;We should not reject the possibility of respecting communities
of bacteria without analyzing the issue seriously&rdquo; (2016: 179;
cf. Sebo 2025).</p>

<h4 id="PlanProdAnim">5.2.2 Plant Production and Animals</h4>

<p>
Uncontroversially, plants are impressive (Schlanger 2024), but
Marder&rsquo;s view rests on a controversial interpretation of plant
science and, in particular, on a controversial view that vegetal
responses to stimuli&mdash;for example that &ldquo;roots&hellip;are
capable of altering their growth pattern in moving toward
resource-rich soil or away from nearby roots of other members of the
same species&rdquo; (2016: 176)&mdash;suffice to show that plants have
interests and are ends in themselves, and it is pro tanto wrong to
kill them and treat them as tools.</p>

<p>
Uncontroversially, much plant production <em>does</em> have various
bad consequences for animals. Plant production in the US is largely
large scale. Large-scale plant production involves&mdash;intentionally
or otherwise&mdash;killing a great many sentient creatures. Animals
are killed by tractors and pesticides. They are killed or left to die
by loss of habitat (Davis 2003; Archer 2011). The scope of the killing
is disputed in Lamey 2007 and Matheny 2003 but all agree it is
vast.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;intentionally or otherwise&rdquo; is important to some.
While these harms are foreseen consequences of farming, they are
unintended. To some, that animals are harmed but not intentionally
harmed in producing corn in Iowa helps to make those harms permissible
(see entry on
 <a href="../double-effect/">doctrine of double effect</a>).
 Pigs farmed in Iowa, by contrast, are intentionally killed. Chickens
and cows, too. (Are any intentionally hurt? Not typically. Farming is
not sadistic.)</p>

<p>
The scale is important, too. Davis (2003) and Archer (2011) argue that
some forms of meat production kill fewer animals than plant production
and, because of that, are preferable to plant production. Their idea
is that if animal farming is wrong because it kills animals simply in
the process of producing food we don&rsquo;t need, then some forms of
plant farming are wrong for the same reason. More weakly, if animal
farming is wrong because it kills <em>very large</em> numbers of
animals in the process of producing food we don&rsquo;t need, then
some forms of plant farming are wrong for the same reason.</p>

<p>
An outstanding issue is whether these harms are necessary components
of plant production or contingent. A further issue is how easy it
would be to strip these harms off of plant production while still
producing foods humans want to eat at prices they are willing and able
to pay.</p>

<h4 id="PlanProdEnvi">5.2.3 Plant Production and the Environment</h4>

<p>
A final objection to the permissibility of plant production: There are
clearly environmental costs of plant production. Indeed, the
environmental costs of plant farming are large: topsoil loss; erosion;
deforestation; run-off; resource-depletion; greenhouse gas emissions.
To take just the last two examples, Budolfson (2016: 169) estimates
that broccoli produces more kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> per thousand
calories than pork and that almonds use two and a half times the water
per thousand calories that chicken does.</p>

<p>
If some forms of animal farming are wrong for those environmental
reasons, presented in &sect;2.2.3, then some forms of plant farming
are wrong for those reasons (Budolfson 2018 and Bruckner
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Again, an outstanding issue is whether these harms are necessary
components of plant production or contingent. A further issue is how
easy it would be to strip these harms off of plant production while
still producing foods people want to eat at prices they are willing
and able to pay.</p>

<h3 id="SummAnimProdPlanSubs">5.3 Summary of Animal Product and Plant Subsections</h3>

<p>
Moral vegetarian arguments standardly oppose treating animals in
various ways while raising them for food that we do not need to eat to
survive. This standardly makes up part of the arguments that it is
wrong to <em>eat</em> animals.</p>

<p>
These arguments against meat production can be extended <em>mutatis
mutandis</em> to animal product production. They can be extended, too,
to some forms of plant production. This suggests:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
The arguments against industrial plant production and animal product
production are as strong as the arguments against meat production.</p>

<p>
The arguments against meat production show that meat production is
wrong. Hence,</p>

<p>
The arguments against industrial plant production and animal product
production show that those practices are wrong.</p>
</div>

<p>
One possibility is that the first premise is false and that some of
the arguments are stronger than others.</p>

<p>
Another possibility is that the first premise is true and all these
arguments are equally strong. We would then have to choose between
accepting the second premise&mdash;and thereby accepting the
conclusion&mdash;or denying that meat production is wrong.</p>

<p>
Another possibility is that the argument is sound but of limited
scope, there being few if any alternatives in the industrialized West
to industrialized plant, animal product, and meat production. The idea
would be, sure, all these practices are at least <em>pro tanto</em>
wrong, but it is all things considered permissible to produce some
food.</p>

<p>
A final possibility is that the parity of these arguments and evident
unsoundness of an argument against industrial plant production show
that the ideas behind those arguments are being misexpressed. Properly
understood, they do not issue in a directive about the wrongness of
this practice or that. Rather, properly understood, they just show
that various practices are bad in various ways. If so, we can then
ask: Which are worse? And in which ways? The literature typically
ranks factory farming as worse for animals than industrial plant
farming if only because the former requires the latter and produces
various harms&mdash;the suffering of billions of chickens&mdash;that
the latter does not. Or consider the debate in the literature about
the relative harmfulness to animals of freerange farming and
industrial plant farming. Which produces more animal death or more
animal suffering? Ought we minimize that suffering? Or consider the
relative harmfulness of freerange and industrial animal farming. Some
argue that the former is worse for the environment but better for
animals. If so, there is a not-easy question about which, if any, to
go in for.</p>

<h2 id="ConcWherDebaAbouVegeStanGoin">6. New Directions</h2>

<p>
One way to think about some ideas of the last section is that the road
that gets you to moral vegetarianism goes much farther than that. Some
interesting new work urges that the road doesn&rsquo;t even quite get
to moral vegetarianism.</p>

<p>
This entry has omitted quite direct arguments against consuming meat,
arguments that do not derive from premises about the wrongness of
<em>producing</em> this or that. This leaves a hole. For even if it is
wrong to eat wrongfully-produced food, mightn&rsquo;t it be
permissible to eat faultless roadkill (Koelle 2012; Bruckner 2015) or
the corpse of an animal dead from natural causes (Foer 2009) or a lab
creation (Pluhar 2010; Donaldson &amp; Carter (eds.) 2016; Milburn
2016; Abrell 2024)? What sort of vegetarianism is that? Perhaps, as
Fischer (2018 and 2020) urges, what seem like arguments for moral
vegetarianism are best construed as arguments to eat
&ldquo;unusually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Lamey 2019 discusses this. Some traditional arguments in food ethics
stand against it. Judeo-Islamic prohibitions on eating pork, for
example, derive from the uncleanliness of the product rather than the
manner of its production. Rastafari prohibitions on eating meat, for
another example, derive in part from the view that meat consumption is
unnatural. Historically, such prohibitions and justifications for them
have not been limited to prohibitions on consuming meat. The <em>Laws
of Manu</em>&rsquo;s prohibition on onion-eating derives from what
consuming onion will do to the consumer rather than the manner of
onion-production (Doniger &amp; Smith (trans.) 1991: 102). The
Koran&rsquo;s prohibition on alcohol-drinking derives from what
consuming alcohol will do to the consumer rather than the manner of
alcohol-production (5:90&ndash;91). As the introduction mentioned,
Porphyry opposed meat-eating partly because it was pleasant and,
hence, distracted the intellect. Whether the meat was
wrongfully-produced was irrelevant to that argument.</p>

<p>
Arguments like this, arguments against consumption that start from
premises about intrinsic features of the consumed or about the
consumed&rsquo;s effects on consumers, largely do not appear in the
contemporary philosophical literature. Somewhat more common these days
are arguments according to which the wrongness of consumption and
production are explained by a common feature. For example, it is wrong
to eat something and to produce it because doing so exploits or treats
an end-it-itself as a mere means (Diamond 1978 and Korsgaard 2018).
Arguments like this do not have any more trouble explaining why it is
wrong to eat roadkill than a factory-farmed chicken.</p>

<p>
They might have some trouble with pets though. Korsgaard is admirably
upfront about this. Pets--even the word might suggest something off
about our relation with them--are a tricky issue for moral
vegetarians. As discussed in
 <a href="#ExteMoraVegeArguAnimProdPlan">&sect;5</a>,
 the moral vegetarian case against killing, hurting, or raising
animals for food might well be extended to killing, hurting, or
raising animals in other circumstances. Indeed, as Sebo (2025) urges,
they might be extended to beings other than animals. But, just
sticking to animals for now, what, if anything, might moral vegetarian
arguments show about the ethical treatment of pets (Bok 2011; Overall
(ed.) 2017; Palmer 2011; Milburn 2022)? Of zoo animals (Gruen 2011:
Chapter 5; Gruen (ed.) 2014; Browning and Veit 2024)? Animals in
shelters (Giroux, Pepper, and Voigt (eds.) 2023)? Laboratory animals
(Gruen (ed.) 2014)? May moral vegetarians feed their dogs meat
(Milburn 2022)? Would it make a difference if the meat were otherwise
going to be wasted, were just byproduct of factory farms that produce
McNuggets or Big Macs? Relatedly, moral vegetarians oppose chicken
killing and consumption and yet some of them aid and abet domestic
cats in killing billions of birds each year in the United States alone
(Loss, et al. 2013; Pressler 2013). Is this permissible? If so, why
(Cohen 2004; Milburn 2015; Sittler-Adamczewski 2016)?</p>

<p>
What, if anything, do moral vegetarian arguments show about duties
regarding wild animals? Palmer 2010 opens with two cases from 2007,
one of which involved the accidental deaths of 10,000 wildebeest in
Kenya, the other involving the mistreatment and death of 150 horses in
England. As Palmer notes, it is plausible that we are required to care
for and help domesticated animals&mdash;that&rsquo;s why it is
plausibly wrong to let horses under our care suffer&mdash;but
permissible to let similar harms befall wild
animals&mdash;that&rsquo;s why it is plausibly permissible to let
wildebeest suffer and die. And yet, Palmer continues, it is also
plausible that animals with similar capacities&mdash;animals like
horses and wildebeest&mdash;should be treated similarly. So was our
toleration of 10,000 wildebeest deaths permissible? Or did we make a
moral mistake in not intervening in such cases? McMahan 2015 and,
especially, Faria 2022 argue that standard moral vegetarian arguments
against killing and suffering lead (eventually) to the conclusion that
we ought to reduce predation in the wild (and do quite a bit more);
Korsgaard 2018 is more skeptical. Donaldson &amp; Kymlicka 2011 use
those standard arguments to get to conclusions about infrastructure
and citizenship for animals. These discussions&nbsp;are partly about
whether consumers need do more than not consume wrongfully-produced
goods. Need they be pickier in how they spend their money than simply
not buying meat, e.g., not going to restaurants that serve any meat?
Need they protest or lobby? What forms of solidarity are called for
and why? What would it even be to be in solidarity with a chicken?
Cochrane and Cojocaru 2022 is squarely on these last few questions.
Shelby 2005, Bommarito 2016, and Zhao 2019 all bear on them.</p>

<p>
This entry has attended mostly to moral issues about animals, but
recent work on consumption and food justice has paid a good deal of
attention to people. Sexism, racism, classism, and ableism are unjust.
Among the issues of food justice, then, are how, if at all, the
practices of vegetarianism and omnivorism or encouragement of them are
sexist (C. Adams 1990) or racist (Alkon &amp; Agyeman (eds.) 2011) or
classist (Guthman 2011) or ableist (Van Dyke 2018).</p>

<p>
Industrial animal agriculture raises its own questions of justice: It
degrades the environment&mdash;is this unjust to future generations
who will inherit this degraded environment? Also, what makes it so
environmentally harmful is the scale of it. That scale is driven, in
part, by demand for meat among the increasingly affluent in developing
countries (Herrero &amp; Thornton 2013). Is refusing to meet that
demand&mdash;after catering to wealthy Western palates for a long
stretch&mdash;a form of classism or racism?</p>

<p>
There are also questions of intergenerational justice having to do
with the ethics of caregivers feeding kids meat or not (Fredericks and
Fischer 2024). If it is typically wrong for Leon to eat the hot dog,
it is typically wrong for young Leon Jr. to eat the hot dog. Is it
morally permissible for Leon to cook a hot dog for Leon Jr.? Or to not
intervene when Leon Jr. orders one at a baseball game?</p>

<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Given length limits, this entry cannot convey the vastness of the
moral vegetarian literature. <em>Between the Species</em>, <em>Journal
of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics</em>, <em>Journal of Animal
Ethics</em>, <em>Environmental Ethics</em>, and <em>Food Ethics</em>
publish relevant articles yearly. Dozens of good articles and books
have been omitted from discussion. Also, I have attended almost only
to academic work and the arguments have come almost only from
philosophy, but some of the best philosophical literature on moral
vegetarianism is literature. Coetzee 1999, Kang 2016, and Tokarczuk
2019, for example, cover quite a bit of &sect;2 and &sect;4. There is
excellent work in the popular press. There are poems and movies.</p>

<p>
The moral vegetarian literature arguments mostly attends to according
to which certain products are wrongfully produced and consumption of
such products bears a certain relation to that wrongdoing and,
<em>ipso facto</em>, is wrong. Moral vegetarians then argue that meat
is such a product: It is typically wrongfully produced and consuming
it typically bears a certain relation to that wrongdoing. This then
leaves the moral vegetarian open to two sorts of objections:
objections to the claims about production&mdash;<em>is</em> meat
produced that way? Is such production wrongful?&mdash;and objections
to the claims connecting consumption to production&mdash;<em>is</em>
consuming meat related to wrongful production in the relevant way? Is
being so related wrong? Explaining moral vegetarian answers to these
questions was the work of
 <a href="#MeatProd">&sect;2</a>
 and
 <a href="#ProdCons">&sect;4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
There are further questions. If moral vegetarian arguments against
meat-consumption are sound, then are arguments against animal
<em>product</em> consumption also sound? Might dairy, eggs, and honey
be wrongfully produced as moral vegetarians argue meat is? Might
consuming them wrongfully relate the consumer to that production?
Explaining the case for &ldquo;yes, yes, and yes&rdquo; was some of
the work of
 <a href="#ExteMoraVegeArguAnimProdPlan">&sect;5</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Relatedly, some plants, fruit, and nuts might be wrongfully produced.
Some tomatoes are picked by workers working in conditions just short
of slavery (Bowe 2007); industrial production of apples sucks up much
water (Budolfson 2016) and destroys animal habitat; industrial
production of corn crushes numerous small animals to death (Davis
2003). Are these foods wrongfully produced? Might consuming them
wrongfully relate the consumer to that production? Explaining the case
for &ldquo;yes and yes&rdquo; was some of the work of
 <a href="#ExteMoraVegeArguAnimProdPlan">&sect;5</a>.
 While the entry mostly attended to birds and land mammals,
 <a href="#ExteMoraVegeArguAnimProdPlan">&sect;</a>3
 applied some of its ideas to sea creatures and insects. As Crary and
Gruen note, &ldquo;abstaining from the products of industrial animal
agriculture...does not release us from entanglements in the global web
of practices in which human beings harm and kill other animals&rdquo;
(2022: 139). As stressed in
 <a href="#ExteMoraVegeArguAnimProdPlan">&sect;</a>6,
 the web binds us to people, too, and all sorts of animals we
don&rsquo;t and&nbsp;would not dream of eating.</p>
