<h1>Moore&rsquo;s Moral Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jan 26, 2005; substantive revision Tue Jun 17, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
G.E. Moore&rsquo;s <em>Principia Ethica</em> of 1903 is often
considered a revolutionary work that set a new agenda for
20<sup>th</sup>-century ethics. This historical view is, however,
somewhat overstated. In metaethics Moore&rsquo;s non-naturalist
realism was close to that defended by Henry Sidgwick and other late
19<sup>th</sup>-century philosophers such as Hastings Rashdall, Franz
Brentano, and J.M.E. McTaggart; in normative ethics his ideal
consequentialism likewise echoed views of Rashdall, Brentano, and
McTaggart. But <em>Principia Ethica</em> presented its views with
unusual force and vigor. In particular, it made much more of the
alleged errors of metaethical naturalism than Sidgwick or Rashdall
had, saying they vitiated most previous moral philosophy. For this
reason, Moore&rsquo;s work had a disproportionate influence on
20<sup>th</sup>-century moral philosophy and remains the best-known
expression of a general metaethical view also shared by later writers
such as H.A. Prichard, W.D. Ross, and C.D. Broad and, after a period
when it was largely dismissed, enjoying a revival today.</p>

<h2 id="NonNatuOpenQuesArgu">1. Non-naturalism and the Open-Question Argument</h2>

<p>
Moore&rsquo;s metaethical non-naturalism comprised two main theses.
One was the realist thesis that moral and more generally normative
judgements &ndash; like many of his contemporaries, Moore did not
distinguish the two &ndash; are true or false objectively, or
independently of any beliefs or attitudes we may have; there are
objective moral truths. The other was the autonomy-of-ethics thesis
that moral judgements are <em>sui generis</em>, neither reducible to
nor derivable from non-moral, for example scientific or metaphysical,
judgements; they express a distinctive kind of truth. While the
realist thesis is shared with naturalist views, which take moral
truths to be equivalent to some non-moral ones, the autonomy-of-ethics
thesis separates his realism from any naturalist one and makes it a
non-naturalist moral realism. And closely connected to his
non-naturalism was the epistemological view that our knowledge of
moral truths is intuitive, in the sense that it is not arrived at by
inference from non-moral truths but rests on our recognizing certain
moral propositions, principally ones about what is intrinsically good,
as self-evident, by a kind of direct or immediate insight. In the
Preface to <em>Principia Ethica</em> he called any attempt to argue
for a proposition of this kind on the basis of other propositions a
sign of &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; (1903: ix/1993: 34).</p>

<p>
Moore expressed the realist side of his non-naturalism by saying that
fundamental moral judgements ascribe the property of goodness or
badness to states of affairs, though especially in <em>Principia
Ethica</em> he tended not to distinguish moral concepts and moral
properties. Like others of his time, he seems to have taken the
realist view that moral judgements can be objectively true for
granted; he certainly did not defend it extensively against
anti-realist alternatives. Thus the first sentence of <em>Principia
Ethica</em> refers casually, and without any sense of controversy, to
the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of some ethical judgements (1903: 1/1993: 53).
In this he was doubtless influenced by the grammar of moral
judgements, which have a standard subject-predicate form, as in
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is good.&rdquo; But it may also be relevant that, at
least in his early writings, the only version of subjectivism he
appears to have been aware of was the naturalist view that to say
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is good&rdquo; is to report some psychological fact
such as that you approve of <em>x</em> or that most people in your
society do. In his 1912 book <em>Ethics</em> he argued, among other
things, that this view does not allow for moral disagreement since,
for example, my report that I approve of <em>x</em> and your report
that you disapprove of it can both be true and therefore do not
conflict (1912: 100&ndash;03/1947: 62&ndash;64/1965: 42&ndash;43).
Late in his life he encountered the non-cognitivist emotivism of C.L.
Stevenson, which says that moral judgements express rather than report
feelings and therefore can conflict despite not being capable of truth
(Stevenson 1942). He initially conceded, surprisingly, that
Stevenson&rsquo;s anti-realist view had as good a claim as his own to
be true (1942: 544&ndash;45), but shortly after reverted to his
earlier non-naturalism, saying he could not imagine what had induced
him to consider abandoning it (Ewing 1962: 251).</p>

<p>
Especially in <em>Principia Ethica</em>, Moore spent much more time
defending his other non-naturalist thesis, about the autonomy of
ethics, which he expressed by saying the concept or property of
goodness &ndash; recall that he did not distinguish the two, or
thought that what is true of one will be true of the other &ndash; is
simple and unanalyzable, and in particular is unanalyzable in
non-moral terms. This meant the property or goodness is
&ldquo;non-natural,&rdquo; or distinct from any of the natural
properties studied by science, though he also thought it distinct from
metaphysical properties such as those it is linked to in Idealist
ethical theories. Views that denied this thesis committed what he
called &ldquo;the naturalistic fallacy&rdquo; (1903: 10/1993: 62),
which he found in hedonists such as Jeremy Bentham, evolutionary
ethicists such as Herbert Spencer, and metaphysical ethicists such as
T.H. Green. His main argument against their view was what has come to
be known as the &ldquo;open-question argument,&rdquo; though he
actually stated in two slightly different ways. Consider a particular
naturalist claim, such as that &ldquo;<em>x</em> is good&rdquo; is
equivalent to &ldquo;<em>x</em> is pleasant&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is pleasure.&rdquo;If this claim were true, he
argued, the judgement &ldquo;Pleasure is good&rdquo; would have the
same content as &ldquo;Pleasure is pleasure,&rdquo; yet surely someone
who asserts the former means to express more than that uninformative
tautology; he means to say something substantive, or that can be
disputed. Alternatively, if this naturalist claim were true,
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is pleasant but <em>x</em> is not good&rdquo; would
be self-contradictory. Once it was established that <em>x</em> is
pleasant, the question whether it is good would be closed, or not
worth considering, whereas, he argued, it remains entirely open. The
same argument can be mounted against any other naturalist proposal:
even if we have determined that something is what we desire to desire
or is highly evolved, the question whether it is good remains open, in
the sense of not being settled by the meaning of the word
&ldquo;good&rdquo; or the content of the concept. (Moore actually
denied that the kind of analysis he thought is impossible for
&ldquo;good&rdquo; is of the meaning of a word; it is more of the
content of a concept (1903: 6/1993: 58).) We can ask whether what we
desire to desire is good, and likewise for what is highly evolved,
what is unified, or anything else (1903: 10&ndash;17/1993:
62&ndash;69). Sidgwick had used one form of this argument against
naturalist claims by Bentham and Spencer, but only in passing (1907:
26n, 109); Moore developed it a greater length and made it central to
his metaethics. And though he applied it specifically to
&ldquo;good,&rdquo; it can equally well be used about other moral or
normative concepts such as &ldquo;ought,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; Just as &ldquo;it is pleasant, but is it
good?&rdquo; is an open question, so is, for example, &ldquo;it
maximizes pleasure, but is it right?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The open-question argument is Moore&rsquo;s most famous contribution
to moral philosophy and has been extensively discussed. It continues
to provide a foundation for some metaethical views but is dismissed as
crudely fallacious by others. In a never-completed Preface to a
proposed second edition of <em>Principia Ethica</em> Moore allowed
that his initial presentation of the argument had many flaws but
thought its general thrust and conclusion were still correct (1993:
2&ndash;27). Others have proposed more fundamental objections to
it.</p>

<p>
One such objection says the argument cannot establish a general
anti-naturalist conclusion since every version of it addresses just
one naturalist view, such as the one equating &ldquo;good&rdquo; with
&ldquo;pleasant,&rdquo; and so cannot rule out the possibility that
there is some other natural property to which &ldquo;good&rdquo; is
equivalent. Here it can be replied that the more successful versions
of the argument there are, and the more they involve the natural
properties that figure in the leading ethical views, the more
persuasive it is. The argument is also more persuasive the more the
success of any particular version of it depends on a general sense of
a gap between the moral and non-moral than on any specific feature of
the view being addressed. Another objection says the argument simply
begs the question against naturalism, since it assumes that a claim
like &ldquo;pleasure is good&rdquo; is not analytic or a tautology
whereas the naturalist thinks it is (Frankena 1939; also Sturgeon
2003). Here Moore could and did say the claim does not look
tautological, or at all like &ldquo;pleasure is pleasure&rdquo; or
even &ldquo;a bachelor is an unmarried man.&rdquo; It looks
substantive and informative. But that leads to a further objection,
based on the &ldquo;paradox of analysis.&rdquo; This is the paradox
that if an analysis of a concept is successful it will be
uninformative, since the content of the analysis will be identical to
that of the concept being analyzed, making the judgement that links
the two a tautology (Langford 1942). If this is not a reason to reject
all analyses, as Moore himself did not reject them, it must be
possible for a concept to be one we use and in some sense understand
but whose content we are not fully or explicitly aware of, in which
case an analysis can inform us of that content. But then, the
objection says, &ldquo;good&rdquo; may be a concept of this type, one
whose content is not fully transparent to us; though it is in fact
identical to some natural concept this identity is not obvious and is
even something we would initially deny. Here again, though, a reply is
possible. It says that normally when we accept an analysis as correct
we come, eventually if not immediately, to see that the judgement
affirming it, while initially seeming substantive rather than a
conceptual or analytic truth, is not in fact so. But this, the reply
goes, does not happen with &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Even if we agree that
only pleasure is good, no amount of reflection on the concepts
&ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; will make us think
&ldquo;Pleasure is good&rdquo; merely explicates the concept
&ldquo;good&rdquo; or repeats its content (Ross 1930: 92&ndash;94), or
stop us thinking that it is possible to dispute whether pleasure is
good (Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton 1992: 117).</p>

<p>
Another objection, introduced in the 1970s and very influential since
then, turns on Moore&rsquo;s not distinguishing between concepts and
properties. The objection concedes that the open-question argument
shows that the concept &ldquo;good&rdquo; is distinct from any natural
concept but denies that it follows that the property of goodness is
distinct from any natural property. Empirical science, it says,
uncovers many non-analytic or non-conceptually-based
property-identities, for example, between water and H<sub>2</sub>O.
Thus the property of being water is identical to the property of being
H<sub>2</sub>O even though the concepts &ldquo;water&rdquo; and
&ldquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; are distinct and &ldquo;water is
H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; is not a tautology; its truth had to be
discovered experimentally. By analogy, the objection says, the
property of goodness could be identical to that of being, say,
pleasant even though the concepts &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; are distinct. Moore&rsquo;s erroneous
assumption that what is true of the concept &ldquo;good&rdquo; must
also be true of the property of goodness makes his argument invalid or
ineffective against naturalism as a metaphysical, rather than a
semantic or conceptual, view. (e.g. Harman 1977: 19; Brink 1989: Ch.
6; Sturgeon 2003). Again, however, replies to this objection are
possible. Thus it can be argued that natural-kind properties such as
that of being water have special features that allow non-analytic
identities but that are not had by ethical properties such as
goodness, for which similar identities are not possible; as one author
put it, &ldquo;value is not like water&rdquo; (Gampel 1996; also e.g.
Vessel 2020). More specifically, it can be argued that the property of
being water is complex, or identified in a complex way: it is that
property, whichever it is, that has the further property of being what
explains the behaviour of the stuff found in lakes, rivers, and
streams. When it turns out that being H<sub>2</sub>O is what explains
this behaviour, that property &ldquo;fills a gap&rdquo; in the
property of being water and so makes the two identical (Parfit 2011,
vol. 2: 298&ndash;303, 329&ndash;38). But nothing similar is possible
for goodness, which is not a complex property with a gap that needs
filling. To be good is not to have whatever other property plays some
functional role; it is just to be good, which means the analogy with
water fails. A related &ldquo;moral twin earth&rdquo; argument says
that if what is good were determined in the same way as what is water,
by seeing which property plays a certain explanatory role, then the
claim that <em>x</em> is good, made in a possible world where one
property plays that role, would not contradict the claim that
<em>x</em> is not good made in a different world where a different
property plays that role. (This parallels the way the referent of
&ldquo;water&rdquo; is different in worlds where different properties
explain the behaviour of the stuff in their lakes and rivers.)
Intuitively, however, the two claims do contradict each other;
speakers who make them in the two worlds are disagreeing (Horgan and
Timmons 1991, 1992). If so, the property of goodness is again not like
that of being water and does not allow non-analytic
property-identities; if the concept of of goodness is distinct from
any natural concept, that is indeed evidence that the property of
goodness is likewise distinct from any natural property.</p>

<p>
The extensive discussion of the open-question argument since Moore has
not led to anything like a consensus on its merits. Some philosophers
continue to deploy it while others think one or more of the above
objections decisively refute it. But the attention it continues to
receive, including from its critics, suggests to many that there is
something to the argument, that in the words of one article &ldquo;it
seems impossible to deny that Moore was on to something&rdquo;
(Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton 1992: 116).</p>

<p>
It is worth noting, however, that Moore did not explain the
open-question argument in the way many later non-cognitivists, who
likewise endorsed the argument, would. Following Hume, they held that
moral judgements are intrinsically motivating, so that sincerely
accepting &ldquo;<em>x</em> is good&rdquo; requires a commitment or at
least some motivation to pursue <em>x</em> if that is possible (e.g.
Hare 1952: 81&ndash;93; Hare 1963: 22&ndash;29). But then no analysis
of &ldquo;good&rdquo; in purely natural terms can ever succeed, since
it cannot capture the term&rsquo;s action-guiding force; nor can an
evaluative conclusion be validly inferred from premises none of which
have that force. The non-cognitivists took this Humean explanation to
support an anti-realist view on which moral judgements do not experss
propositions that can be true but do something like express attitudes,
but it is also consistent with a version of non-naturalism that says
moral truths, uniquely among truths, are intrinsically motivating.
Whatever the explanation&rsquo;s merits, however, it is not one Moore
himself gave. The question whether moral judgements are intrinsically
motivating is not one on which he expressed clear views or which he
apparently thought important. In <em>Principia Ethica</em> he remarked
in passing that we &ldquo;hardly ever&rdquo; think something good
without having some attitude of will towards it, but he denied that
this is true universally (1903: 131, 135&ndash;36/1993: 181&ndash;82,
186). Whether it is true universally, and what might follow if it is,
is not something he seems to have thought worth considering further.
So even if a claim about motivation gives a good or even the best
explanation of the open-question argument, as many later philosophers
have held, Moore&rsquo;s own version of it was, at least as he
explicitly stated it, independent of that claim.</p>

<h2 id="MetaInno">2. Metaethical Innovations</h2>

<p>
The main elements of Moore&rsquo;s non-naturalism &ndash; moral
realism and the autonomy of ethics &ndash; had been defended earlier
by Sidgwick and others and were reasonably well known when Moore
wrote. This is reflected in the initial reviews of <em>Principia
Ethica</em> and early responses to it, many of which questioned its
claims to metaethical originality (see Welchman 1989). But Moore did
add two metaethical innovations. One was his view that the fundamental
moral concept is &ldquo;good&rdquo; (plus its contrary
&ldquo;bad&rdquo;), which he expressed by saying that goodness is
simple and unanalyzable, even in moral terms. This had not been
Sidgwick&rsquo;s view. For him the central moral concept was
&ldquo;ought,&rdquo; and he defined good in terms of ought, more
specifically as what one ought to desire (1907: 112). <em>Principia
Ethica</em> took the exactly opposite view, defining ought in terms of
good, so &ldquo;one ought to do <em>x</em>&rdquo; literally means
&ldquo;<em>x</em> will produce the most good possible&rdquo; (1903:
25, 146&ndash;48/1993: 76&ndash;77, 196&ndash;98); this reduced
&ldquo;ought&rdquo; to &ldquo;good.&rdquo; But Moore was quickly
persuaded by Bertrand Russell that this view is vulnerable to his own
open-question argument, since in saying &ldquo;one ought to do what
will produce the most good&rdquo; we do not mean just &ldquo;what will
produce the most good will produce the most good&rdquo; (Russell 1904:
330). In later work such as <em>Ethics</em> he therefore held that
ought is a distinct moral concept from good (1912: 173,
180&ndash;81/1947: 107&ndash;08, 112&ndash;13/1965: 73, 76&ndash;77;
also 1942: 558&ndash;59), and in an uncompleted Preface to a planned
second edition of <em>Principia Ethica</em> allowed that it would not
affect the essence of his non-naturalism if good were defined in moral
terms, say, as what one ought to desire (1993: 5, 14&ndash;15). But he
continued to prefer the view that good is a simple concept, not
definable in terms of a deontic one like ought (1942: 574&ndash;77),
and there was vigorous debate on this topic in this general period,
with Brentano (1969), Broad (1930), and A.C. Ewing (1947) defending
reductive analyses similar to Sidgwick&rsquo;s while Ross (1930)
preferred a non-reductive view like Moore&rsquo;s. On the Moorean view
judgements about the goodness of states of affairs are not shorthand
for judgements about how we ought or have reason to respond to those
states; they are independent judgements that explain, synthetically
but as following &ldquo;from the very nature&rdquo; of goodness, why
we ought to respond in those ways.</p>

<p>
Moore&rsquo;s second innovation was his view that the intrinsic value
of a state of affairs can depend only on its intrinsic properties,
ones it has apart from any relations to other states. Earlier writers
had distinguished between goodness as an end, which they also called
intrinsic or ultimate goodness, and goodness as a means, and had said
the former cannot rest just on a state&rsquo;s causally producing
goods external to itself. But they seemed to allow that goodness as an
end can depend on other relational properties; thus they talked as if
a belief&rsquo;s being true, which is necessary for its being
knowledge, can increase its value, while a pleasure&rsquo;s being that
of a bad person can make it worse. Moore did not explicitly state his
more restrictive view that intrinsic goodness can depend only on
intrinsic properties until &ldquo;The Conception of Intrinsic
Value&rdquo; of 1922 but it nonetheless guided <em>Principia
Ethica</em> at two points. One was the book&rsquo;s specific
formulation of its principle of organic unities, discussed below. The
other was its testing for a state&rsquo;s intrinsic value by the
&ldquo;method of isolation,&rdquo; which involves asking whether a
universe containing only that state and no other would be good (1903:
91, 93, 95, 187&ndash;88, 208/1993: 142, 145, 147, 236&ndash;37, 256);
the point of this method is precisely to insulate judgements of
intrinsic value from facts about a state&rsquo;s external relations by
ensuring that there are none. Moore&rsquo;s strict view was shared by
some later writers such as Ross (1930: 75), while others argued that a
better theory of value results if intrinsic goodness is allowed to
depend on some relational properties (e.g. Ewing 1947: 114). But Moore
was the first to raise this issue clearly.</p>

<p>
These two innovations, though not trivial, do not affect the core of a
non-naturalist metaethics. Some critics, however, charge that Moore
did change that view fundamentally, and for the worse. They say
Sidgwick&rsquo;s non-naturalism was comparatively modest, holding only
that there are truths about what people ought or have reason to do
that we can know by reflection. Moore, the objection runs,
supplemented this modest view with an extravagant metaphysics of
non-natural properties inhabiting a dubious supersensible realm and a
mysterious faculty of intuition that acquaints us with them. These
additions, the critics say, opened non-naturalism to entirely
avoidable objections and led, regrettably, to its widespread rejection
by later philosophers (e.g. Mackie 1976: 323; Shaver 2000:
263&ndash;65; Phillips 2011: 29&ndash;30).</p>

<p>
These charges can, however, be resisted. <em>Principia Ethica</em>
actually downplayed the metaphysical side of its non-naturalism,
saying that goodness has &ldquo;being&rdquo; but does not
&ldquo;exist&rdquo;, as numbers, too, have being but do not exist; in
particular, it said goodness does not exist in any
&ldquo;supersensible reality&rdquo; because there is no such reality
(1903: 110&ndash;12, 123&ndash;25/1993: 161&ndash;63, 174&ndash;76).
What exactly Moore meant by these claims is unclear, but it is at
least possible to read them as suggesting a non-metaphysical moral
realism like those defended more recently by Thomas Nagel (1986), T.M.
Scanlon (1998, 2014), and Derek Parfit (2011, vol. 2: 464&ndash;87 ).
Nor did his explicit talk of properties mark a significant departure
from Sidgwick. This is partly because he did not clearly distinguish
concepts and properties and partly because if Sidgwick thought people
ought to pursue pleasure, he would surely have to grant that pleasure
has the property of being something people ought to pursue. The
question is how ontologically robust Moore&rsquo;s talk of a property
of goodness was, and given his denial that such goodness
&ldquo;exists&rdquo; the answer is uncertain; the distinction between
more and less metaphysical forms of non-naturalism is not one he
clearly addressed. Nor would all present-day philosophers agree that,
if his talk of the property was more metaphysical, it was therefore
problematic; there have been vigorous recent defences of so-called
&ldquo;robust&rdquo; moral realism (e.g. Enoch 2011).</p>

<p>
Moore was, at least at times, similarly modest in his moral
epistemology. Thus he said several times, as Sidgwick also had, that
by calling our knowledge of basic moral truths &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo;
he meant only that it is not derived by inference from other
knowledge; in particular, he denied that moral intuition is
infallible, saying that in whatever way we can cognize a true
proposition, we can cognize a false one (1903: viii, x/1993: 34, 36).
He did sometimes make unqualified assertions of self-evidence, as in
his claims in <em>Principia Ethica</em> that it is
&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; that the chief intrinsic goods are aesthetic
appreciation and personal love (1903: 188/1993: 237) and in
<em>Ethics</em> that it is &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo; that what is
right is always what most promotes the good (1912: 1809&ndash;81/1947:
112&ndash;13/1965: 76&ndash;77). These assertions fit his claim, in
the Preface to <em>Principia Ethica</em>, that no other evidence for a
fundamental moral proposition can be given, and some critics have
found their baldness, especially given the abstract contents,
troubling (e.g. MacIntyre 1981). But the contrast with earlier
non-naturalists such as Sidgwick should again not be overdrawn.
Sidgwick, too, gave most weight to intuitions about abstract moral
principles (1907: 379&ndash;84), including one close to the
consequentialist principle Moore affirmed in <em>Ethics</em>, and
appealed to more concrete judgements only in <em>ad hominem</em>
arguments against opponents. And Moore often argued in more complex
ways than the claim in his Preface allowed. Later in <em>Principia
Ethica</em> he defended his claim that beauty on its own is good by
appealing to intuitions about a specific beautiful world, containing
mountains, rivers, and sunsets (1903: 83&ndash;85/1993: 135&ndash;36),
and criticized the view that only pleasure is good by arguing that it
conflicts with several more concrete things we believe, such as that
there are bad pleasures (1903: 95/1993:146&ndash;47) and that a life
of intensely pleasurable but illusory experiences would not be best
(1903: 197&ndash;98/1993: 246&ndash;47; compare 1912: 52&ndash;53,
237&ndash;39/1947: 34, 146&ndash;47/1965: 22, 102). He likewise
insisted, as Sidgwick also had, that before we make judgements of
self-evidence we need to make sure that the propositions we are
considering are clear (1903: viii/1993: 34); failure to do so, he
argued, explains many of the existing disagreements about ethics. And
he took note of common opinions to the extent of trying to explain
away contrary views when he found them. Overall his approach to
establishing moral truths was close to Sidgwick&rsquo;s, appealing to
intuitive judgements that can be made at different levels of
generality and that have to be brought into a coherent whole, though
with the primary emphasis again on more abstract intuitions. This is
not to say his non-naturalism was beyond objection. Any such view
holds that there are truths independent of natural and logical ones
and knowable by some non-empirical means, and many find this pair of
claims dubious. But Moore&rsquo;s version of the view was arguably no
more objectionable than others. If Sidgwick&rsquo;s non-naturalism and
more recent ones like Nagel&rsquo;s and Scanlon&rsquo;s do not involve
a problematic metaphysics and epistemology, neither did Moore&rsquo;s;
if Moore&rsquo;s was hopelessly extravagant, so are those supposedly
more modest ones.</p>

<p>
A final important feature of Moore&rsquo;s metaethics was its
reductionism about the normative concepts. Like Sidgwick, the Moore of
<em>Principia Ethica</em> thought there is just one basic normative
concept, though for him it was good rather than ought; like Ross, the
later Moore held that there are just those two. But this conceptual
reductionism, which was common throughout the period from Sidgwick to
Ross, Broad, and Ewing, contrasts with the plurality of concepts
recognized in much present-day moral philosophy. First, Moore and his
contemporaries took as basic only the &ldquo;thin&rdquo; concepts good
and ought rather than &ldquo;thick&rdquo; moral concepts such as
courage and generosity; the latter, they held, combine a thin concept
with some more or less determinate descriptive content and so are
secondary. They were also reductive about the thin concepts. They did
not distinguish between moral oughts and prudential or rational ones,
holding that there is only a single ought that they called
&ldquo;moral&rdquo;; this is why for them egoism was a view about
morality, not a challenge to it from outside the moral realm. Nor did
they recognize different types of value. For them goodness was a
property only of states of affairs and not, as some Kantians hold, of
persons or other objects. They likewise did not accept the late
20<sup>th</sup>-century idea that there is a distinct evaluative
concept of &ldquo;well-being,&rdquo; or of what is &ldquo;good
for&rdquo; a person; instead, they often gave &ldquo;good for&rdquo; a
&ldquo;locative&rdquo; analysis, as what is simply good and located in
a given person&rsquo;s life, thereby reducing it to &ldquo;good&rdquo;
(e.g. Sidgwick 1907: 112; Moore 1903: 98&ndash;99/1993: 150&ndash;51).
Nor did they see any fundamental distinction between moral and
non-moral goodness, holding that the former is just ordinary goodness
when possessed by certain objects such as traits of character (e.g.
Ross 1930: 155). The result was that all normative judgements can be
expressed using at most the two concepts &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ought,&rdquo; which are therefore the only ones these
judgements need. To some this conclusion will mean that Moore and his
contemporaries ignored important conceptual distinctions; to others it
will mean they avoided pointless conceptual fiddling. But it did free
them to discuss substantive questions about what is in fact good and
right. On this topic Moore&rsquo;s views, though not entirely novel,
were again both striking and strikingly stated.</p>

<h2 id="ImpeCons">3. Impersonal Consequentialism</h2>

<p>
Moore&rsquo;s normative view again comprised two main theses. One was
impersonal consequentialism, the view that what is right is always
what produces the greatest total good impartially considered, or
counting all people&rsquo;s goods equally. The other was the ideal or
perfectionist thesis that what is good is not only or primarily
pleasure or the satisfaction of desires but certain states whose value
is independent of people&rsquo;s attitudes to them. Moore recognized
several such states, but in <em>Principia Ethica</em> famously said
&ldquo;by far the most valuable things&hellip;are certain states of
consciousness, which may roughly be described as the pleasures of
human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects&rdquo; (1903:
188/1993: 237). According to his ideal consequentialism, what is right
is in large part what most promotes loving personal relationships and
aesthetic appreciation for all persons everywhere.</p>

<p>
<em>Principia Ethica</em> took the consequentialist part of this view
to be analytically true, since it defined the right as what most
promotes the good. But once Moore abandoned this definition, he had to
treat the consequentialist principle as synthetic and did so in
<em>Ethics</em>, where he allowed that deontological views that say
some acts that maximize the good are wrong are coherent. But even
there he did not argue at length for consequentialism, simply
announcing that it is self-evident (1912: 180&ndash;81/1947:
112&ndash;13/1965: 76&ndash;77). This in part reflected a common
assumption of his time, when a majority of moral philosophers accepted
some form of consequentialism. But it may also be relevant that the
only alternative to consequentialism he seems to have considered was
an absolute deontology like Kant&rsquo;s, which says that some acts
such as killing and lying are wrong no matter what their consequences
(1903: 106/1993: 157; 1912: 175&ndash;81/1947: 109&ndash;13/1965:
74&ndash;77). His major ethical works did not consider a moderate
deontology such as would later be developed by Ross (1930) and Broad
(1930), in which deontological prohibitions against killing and lying
often outweigh considerations of good consequences but can themselves
be outweighed if enough good is at stake. It is not clear what
Moore&rsquo;s response to such a moderate deontology would have
been.</p>

<p>
<em>Principia Ethica</em> also took the impartialism of its view to be
analytic, and in particular claimed that ethical or rational egoism,
which says that each person should pursue only his own good, is
self-contradictory. (Despite his interest in personal love, Moore
never considered the intermediate view that Broad (1971) would call
self-referential altruism, according to which each person should care
more about, and do more to promote, the good of those who are close to
him such as his family and friends.) Sidgwick had claimed that if a
rational egoist confines himself to saying that each person&rsquo;s
pleasure is good for him, in the sense of good relative to him or from
his point of view, he cannot be argued out of his position (1907:
420&ndash;21). But Moore argued that the concept of agent-relative
goodness invoked here is unintelligible (1903: 97&ndash;102/1993:
148&ndash;53), and that conclusion does follow from his view that
goodness is simple and unanalyzable. If goodness is a simple property,
how can a state such as a given person&rsquo;s pleasure have this
property &ldquo;from one point of view&rdquo; but not &ldquo;from
another&rdquo;? (Compare squareness. An object cannot be square from
one point of view but not from another; it either is square or is
not.) All that talk of the good &ldquo;for&rdquo; a person can pick
out, he urged, is what is simply good and located in that person; and
simple goodness gives everyone equally reason to pursue it. In
<em>Ethics</em> Moore abandoned this argument, saying that egoism
cannot be proven false by any argument, even though he thought its
falsity is self-evident (1912: 228&ndash;32/1947: 141&ndash;43/1965:
98&ndash;100). But it is not clear how he could make this concession
if he still held, as he preferred to, that goodness is a simple
property. Perhaps he was tacitly allowing, as he would in the
uncompleted draft Preface to <em>Principia Ethica</em> (1993: 5,
14&ndash;15), that it would not centrally damage his position if good
were analyzed in terms of ought, as it had been by Sidgwick. There is
no contradiction in saying that what each person ought to desire is
different, say, is just his own pleasure. But if all oughts derive
from a simple property of goodness, as Moore always preferred to hold,
all oughts must be impartial.</p>

<p>
In applying this view, Moore gave it the form of what today is called
&ldquo;indirect&rdquo; or &ldquo;two-level&rdquo; (Hare 1981)
consequentialism. In deciding how to act, we should not try to assess
individual acts for their specific consequences; instead, we should
follow certain general moral rules, such as &ldquo;Do not kill&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Keep promises,&rdquo; which are such that adhering to them
will most promote the good overall or through time. This policy will
sometimes lead us not to do the act with the best individual outcome,
but given our general propensity to error the policy&rsquo;s
consequences will be better in the long run than if we tried to assess
acts one by one; however well-meaning, the latter attempt will be
counterproductive (1903: 149&ndash;70/1993: 198&ndash;219. This
indirect consequentialism had again been defended earlier, by Sidgwick
and John Stuart Mill, but Moore gave it a very conservative form,
urging adherence to the rules even in the face of apparently
compelling evidence that breaking them now would be optimific.
<em>Principia Ethica</em> also made the surprising claim that the
relevant rules will be the same given any commonly accepted theory of
the good, for example, given either hedonism or Moore&rsquo;s own
ideal theory (1903: 158/1993: 207). This claim of extensional
equivalence for different consequentialist views was not new; T.H.
Green, F.H. Bradley, and McTaggart had all suggested that hedonism and
ideal consequentialism have similar practical implications. But Moore
was surely expressing the more plausible view when in <em>Ethics</em>
he doubted that pleasure and his ideal values always go together
(1912: 234&ndash;39/1947: 144&ndash;47/1965: 100&ndash;02), and even
when he accepted the equivalence claim he remained intensely
interested in what he called &ldquo;the primary ethical question of
what is good in itself&rdquo; (1903: 158, 26, 77/1993: 207, 78, 128).
Like Green, Bradley, and McTaggart, he thought the central
philosophical question is what <em>explains</em> why good things are
good, i.e., which of their properties <em>make</em> them good. That
was the subject of his most brilliant and original piece of ethical
writing, Chapter 6 of <em>Principia Ethica</em> on &ldquo;The
Ideal.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="Idea">4. The Ideal</h2>

<p>
One of this chapter&rsquo;s larger aims was to defend value-pluralism,
the view that there is not just one ultimate good, as hedonism for
example holds, but several such goods. Moore thought one bar to a
pluralist view is the naturalistic fallacy. He assumed, not
implausibly, that philosophers who treat goodness as identical to some
natural property will usually make this a simple single property, such
as just pleasure or just evolutionary fitness, rather than a complex
disjunctive property such as
pleasure-or-evolutionary-fitness-or-knowledge. But then a naturalist
view pushes us toward value-monism, or the view that only one kind of
state is good (1903: 20; 1993: 72). Once we reject naturalism,
however, we can see what Moore thought is self-evident: that there are
irreducibly many kinds of good. Another bar to value-pluralism is
excessive demands for unity or system in ethics. Sidgwick had used
such demands to argue that only pleasure can be good, since no theory
with a plurality of ultimate values can justify a determinate scheme
for weighing them against each other (1907: 406). But Moore, agreeing
here with Rashdall, Ross, and others, said that &ldquo;to search for
&lsquo;unity&rsquo; and &lsquo;system,&rsquo; at the expense of truth,
is not, I take it, the proper business of philosophy&rdquo; (1903:
222/1993: 270). If intuition reveals a plurality of ultimate goods, an
adequate theory must recognize that plurality.</p>

<p>
According to a famous part of <em>Principia Ethica</em>, one of those
goods is the existence of beauty, independent of any awareness of it.
Arguing against Sidgwick&rsquo;s view that all goods must be states of
consciousness (1907: 113&ndash;15), Moore asked readers to imagine a
beautiful world with no minds in it: is this world&rsquo;s existence
not better, he asked, than that of an ugly world (1903:
83&ndash;85/1993: 135&ndash;36)? His affirmative answer to this
question was one of the most contested of the book&rsquo;s claims in
the years after its publication (Welchman 1989; Jones 1906) and
anticipated some strands in present-day environmental ethics, which
likewise hold that there can be value in features of the natural
environment apart from any awareness of them. But he did not insist on
this answer. Later in <em>Principia Ethica</em> he said that beauty on
its own at most has little and may have no value (1903: 202, 203/1993:
250, 251), and in his later book <em>Ethics</em> he implicitly denied
that beauty on its own has value. There he held, as Sidgwick had, that
all intrinsic goods involve some state of consciousness and perhaps
even of pleasure (1912: 239&ndash;41, 249/1947: 147&ndash;49,
153/1965: 103&ndash;04, 107). His first book, however, had defended
the contrary, more radical view.</p>

<p>
Moore also gave some weight to the hedonic states of pleasure and
pain. He thought the former a very minor good, saying pleasure on its
own at most has limited and may have no value, but he thought pain a
very great evil, which there is a serious duty to prevent (1903:
212&ndash;13, 222&ndash;23/1993: 260&ndash;61, 270&ndash;71) His view
therefore involved a value-asymmetry, with pain a much greater evil
than pleasure is a good. This had not been the traditional view; most
hedonists had held that a pleasure of a given intensity is exactly as
good as a pain of the same intensity is evil (e.g. Sidgwick 1907:
413). But Moore thought it intuitively compelling that the pain is
worse, as some later writers have also held (e.g. Mayerfeld 1999, Ch.
6); if that makes the theory of value less systematic, he said, so
much the worse for system.</p>

<p>
While many ideal consequentialists have treated knowledge as
intrinsically good, in some cases even supremely so, <em>Principia
Ethica</em> did not, saying knowledge is a necessary component of the
larger good of appreciating existing beauty but has little or no value
in itself (1903: 199/1993: 248). Again <em>Ethics</em> may have
reversed this view, citing knowledge several times as one ideal good
that may be added to the hedonists&rsquo; good of pleasure (1912: 237,
247/1947 146, 152/1965: 102, 106). But Moore never saw any intrinsic
value in achievement, for example in business or politics, or indeed
in any active changing of the world. As John Maynard Keynes said, his
chief goods were states of mind that &ldquo;were not associated with
action or achievement or with consequence. They consisted in timeless,
passionate states of contemplation and communion, largely unattached
to &lsquo;before and after&rsquo;&rdquo; (Keynes 1949: 83).</p>

<p>
The first of these goods was the appreciation of beauty, which for
Moore combined the cognition or awareness of beautiful qualities with
an appropriately positive emotion toward them, such as enjoyment or
admiration. We listen to music, for example, hear beautiful qualities
in it, and are pleased by or admire those qualities. But the value
here is entirely contemplative; Moore saw no separate worth in what
the romantics had especially valued, the active creation of beauty
(Baldwin 1993, xxiv). He might say that an artist has to understand
and love his work&rsquo;s beauty if he is to create it, and perhaps to
do so more than someone who merely enjoys it, but the value in his
work is still not distinctively creative rather than contemplative. In
characterizing the good of aesthetic appreciation Moore gave a further
reductive analysis, this time of beauty as &ldquo;that of which the
admiring contemplation is good in itself&rdquo; (1903:
201&ndash;02/1993: 249&ndash;50). Beauty too, then, is not a distinct
evauative concept but analyzable in terms of goodness. He did not
notice, however, that this definition seems again open to an
open-question objection, since it reduces the claim that it is good to
contemplate beauty to the near-tautology that it is good to
contemplate that which it is good to contemplate.</p>

<p>
Though Moore in <em>Principia Ethica</em> thought beauty good in
itself, he did not insist on this view when valuing the appreciation
of beauty; the latter might be good even if the former was not. But he
still thought the real existence of beauty makes a significant
difference to the value there is. More specifically, he thought the
admiring contemplation of beauty that actually exists and causes your
contemplation is significantly better than an otherwise similar
contemplation of merely imagined beauty, and better by more than can
be attributed to the existence of the beauty on its own. This view
involved an application of his &ldquo;principle of organic
unities,&rdquo; which is one of his main contributions to ethics and
says the value of a whole need not equal the sum of the values its
parts would have on their own (1903: 27&ndash;29/1993: 78&ndash;80).
If state <em>x</em> on its own has value <em>a</em> and state
<em>y</em> on its own has value <em>b</em>, the whole formed by
combining them by relation <em>R</em> need not have value <em>a</em> +
<em>b</em>; it may have more than that value and it may have less.
This principle had been accepted by Idealists such as Bradley, who
gave it a characteristically anti-theoretical formulation. They held
that if <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> combine to form the whole
<em>x-R-y</em>, their values, like their very identities, are
dissolved in that larger whole, whose value therefore cannot be
computed from the values of its parts. It was Moore&rsquo;s
contribution to accept the principle in a way that rejected this
anti-theoretical reading and allowed computation, though the exact way
it did so depended on his strict view that intrinsic value can depend
only on intrinsic properties.</p>

<p>
This strict view implies that when <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> enter
into the relation <em>R</em> that constitutes the whole
<em>x-R-y</em>, their own values cannot be changed by that relation.
Thus Moore said, &ldquo;The part of a valuable whole retains exactly
the same value when it is, as when it is not, a part of that
whole&rdquo; (1903: 30/1993: 81). Any additional value in the whole
<em>x-R-y</em> must therefore be attributed to the whole as an entity
distinct from its parts, and with the relation between those parts
internal to it. Moore called this additional value the value of a
whole &ldquo;as a whole,&rdquo; and said it needed to be added to the
value in the parts to arrive at the whole&rsquo;s overall value, or
its value &ldquo;on the whole&rdquo; (1903: 214&ndash;16/1993:
263&ndash;64). Thus, if <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> have values
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on their own, and the whole <em>x-R-y</em>
has value <em>c</em> &ldquo;as a whole,&rdquo; the value of
<em>x-R-y</em> &ldquo;on the whole&rdquo; is <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> +
<em>c</em>. (The value of the whole is therefore not equal to the sum
of the values of its parts, but it is equal to a sum of which those
values are constituents.) This &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; formulation of
the principle of organic unities is not the only one possible. We
could relax the conditions on a thing&rsquo;s intrinsic value so it
can be affected by its external relations and say that when <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> enter into a whole their own values change, so that,
for example, <em>x</em>&rsquo;s value becomes <em>a</em> + <em>c</em>.
This &ldquo;variability&rdquo; formulation of the principle can always
reach the same final conclusion as the holistic one, since whatever
positive or negative value the latter finds in the whole as a whole
the former can add to one or other of the parts. But the two
formulations locate the additional value in different places, and
sometimes one and sometimes the other gives what seems the intuitively
better explanation of an organic value (Hurka 1998). Moore, however,
was forced by his strict view of intrinsic goodness to use only the
holistic formulation. In the aesthetic case, he held that the admiring
contemplation of beauty considered apart from the existence of its
object always has the same (moderate) value <em>a</em>, while the
existence of beauty always has the same (minimal or zero) value
<em>b</em>. But when the two are combined so a person admiringly
contemplates beauty that exists and causes his contemplation, the
resulting whole has the significant additional value <em>c</em> as a
whole, resulting in an overall value of <em>a + b + c</em>. The
existence of the beauty is therefore necessary for the significant
value <em>c</em>, but that value is not intrinsic to it, belonging
instead to the larger whole of which it is a part.</p>

<p>
Moore made several other uses of the principle of organic unities,
including in response to an argument of Sidgwick&rsquo;s for hedonism.
Sidgwick had claimed that there would be no value in a world without
consciousness and, more specifically, without pleasure, and had
concluded that pleasure must therefore be the only ultimate good
(1907: 113, 399&ndash;401). Given <em>Principia Ethica</em>&rsquo;s
view about the value of beauty, Moore in that book rejected the
premise of Sidgwick&rsquo;s argument, but he also argued that, even
granting this premise, Sidgwick&rsquo;s conclusion does not follow. It
may be that pleasure is a necessary condition for any value, but that
once pleasure is present, other states such as the awareness of beauty
or personal love increase the value of the resulting whole even though
on their own they have no worth; they can be necessary for an organic
value but of no value themselves (1903: 92&ndash;94/1993:
144&ndash;45; also 1912: 240&ndash;46/1947: 148&ndash;51/1965:
103&ndash;06). And of course this was precisely his later view.
Another application of the principle was in explicating claims about
desert. Moore endorsed the retributive view that when a person is
morally vicious it is good if he is punished, and he expressed this
view by saying that although the person&rsquo;s vice is bad and his
suffering pain is bad, the combination of vice and pain in the same
life is good as a whole, and sufficiently good to make the situation
on the whole better than if there was vice and no pain, i.e. if there
was vice and no punishment for it (1903: 214&ndash;15/1993:
263&ndash;64). This is in fact a point where Moore&rsquo;s holistic
formulation of the principle is positively appealing. The alternative
variability view must say that when a person is vicious, his suffering
pain switches from being purely bad to being purely good. But this
implies that the morally appropriate response to deserved suffering is
simply positive, for example simple joy, which does not seem right;
the better response mixes satisfaction that justice is being done with
sorrow at the infliction of pain, as a holistic view of desert, on
which the pain remains bad, implies.</p>

<p>
Moore&rsquo;s other chief good, that of personal love, also involved
admiring contemplation, but now of objects, namely persons, with
qualities that are not just beautiful but also intrinsically good
(1903: 203/1993: 251). Since for Moore the main intrinsic goods were
mental qualities, such love involved primarily the admiring
contemplation of another&rsquo;s good states of mind. In so
characterizing love Moore was applying one of four recursive
principles he used to generate higher-level intrinsic goods and evils
from an initial base-set of goods and evils. The first of these
principles says that if state <em>x</em> is intrinsically good, then
admiringly contemplating, or loving, <em>x</em> for itself is also
intrinsically good (1903: 203&ndash;04, 217/1993: 251&ndash;53, 265).
Thus, if person <em>A</em>&rsquo;s admiringly contemplating beauty is
good, person <em>B</em>&rsquo;s admiringly contemplating
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s admiring contemplation is a further good, as is
<em>C</em>&rsquo;s admiring <em>B</em>&rsquo;s admiring, and so on. A
second principle says that if <em>x</em> is intrinsically evil, hating
<em>x</em> for itself is intrinsically good (1903: 217/1993 265);
thus, <em>B</em>&rsquo;s feeling compassionate pain at
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s pain is good. And two final principles say that
loving for itself what is evil, as in sadistic pleasure in
another&rsquo;s pain, and hating for itself what is good, as in
envious pain at his pleasure, are evil (1903: 208&ndash;10,
211&ndash;12/1993: 257&ndash;58, 259&ndash;60). Though Moore stated
these four principles separately, they all make morally appropriate
attitudes to intrinsic goods and evils, ones whose orientation, either
positive or negative, matches their objects&rsquo; values, additional
such goods and morally inappropriate attitudes additional evils. The
principles were not unique to him; they had been defended earlier by
Rashdall (1885; 1907) and Brentano (1969) and would be defended later
by Ross (1930, 1939). But Moore&rsquo;s formulation was in two
respects distinctive. Rashdall and Ross called the higher-level values
they generated virtues and vices, as it is indeed plausible to do;
surely benevolence and compassion are virtuous and sadism is vicious.
But Moore preferred to define the virtues instrumentally, as traits
that cause goods and prevent evils, and said that as such they lack
intrinsic worth (1903: 172&ndash;77/1993: 220&ndash;26). Rashdall and
especially Ross also held that virtue is the greatest intrinsic good
and vice the greatest evil. In contrast, Moore argued that the value
of an appropriate or inappropriate attitude is often less than the
value of its object; thus compassion for another&rsquo;s pain, though
good, is less good than the pain is evil, so the combination of one
person&rsquo;s pain and another&rsquo;s compassion for it has on
balance negative value. &ldquo;We have no reason,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;to maintain the paradox that an ideal world would be one in
which vice and suffering must exist in order that it may contain the
goods consisting in the appropriate emotion towards them. &hellip; we
cannot admit the actual validity of any of the arguments commonly used
in Theodicies; no such argument succeeds in justifying the fact that
there does exist even the smallest of the many evils which this world
contains&rdquo; (1903: 220/1993: 268). The attitudes that others would
call virtuous and held are supremely good had in this way for Moore a
secondary status, or less value than the other goods and evils they
are directed at.</p>

<p>
The recursive principles are clearly relevant to personal love, whose
core involves positive concern for another&rsquo;s good. But
Moore&rsquo;s particular application of the principles led to a
curiously restricted picture of what love is. First, as in the
aesthetic case, he took the main valuable attitude to be
contemplative, involving the admiration of another&rsquo;s already
existing good qualities rather than any active engagement with them.
This applied even to the love of another&rsquo;s physical beauty.
Though he thought this is a central part of love (1903:
203&ndash;04/1993: 252), he took it to involve mere passive admiration
of the other&rsquo;s beauty, as it were from the other side of the
room. There was no desire to possess or interact physically with a
loved one&rsquo;s beauty, that is, no active eroticism. He actually
held that sexual arousal, and especially arousal by another&rsquo;s
arousal, involves love of the ugly or evil and so is evil (1903:
209&ndash;10/1993: 257&ndash;58). The same point applied more
generally: the loving attitude was one of appreciating goods in
another&rsquo;s life rather than of acting to produce or help her
achieve them. One did not do anything for or with a loved one; one
simply admired her. (In an 1899 paper presented to the Apostles
society at Cambridge he had said, &ldquo;Love of others is a thing of
very great value, and it may be very strong although it does not lead
to any action. There is, indeed, no reason why it should&rdquo;
(quoted in Levy 1979: 203).Though for him personal love was an
additional good to aesthetic appreciation, he characterized it in an
essentially aesthetic way. Moreover, his list of the goods one is to
appreciate or applaud in a loved one was also truncated. It did not
include pleasure or happiness, since that was not a significant good;
it was not part of love as he understood it to want or be pleased by a
loved one&rsquo;s pleasure though it was part to be pained by her
pain. Nor was it part to care about her knowledge or achievement.
Instead, the central focus of love was the other&rsquo;s admiring
contemplation of beauty (1903: 204/1993: 252&ndash;53), as if the
supreme expression of love were &ldquo;What excellent taste in
pictures you have.&rdquo; But that had to be the primary focus if
aesthetic appreciation was his one principal intrinsic good besides
love. Finally, Moore took the qualities one appreciates in a loved one
to be simply and therefore impartially good. This meant his account
had no room for the special attachment to or heightened concern for an
individual that many take to be essential to personal love. If I love
a friend for qualities <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>, and a
new person comes along with the same qualities to a slightly higher
degree, then, on Moore&rsquo;s view, I should admire the new
person&rsquo;s qualities more and therefore love them more; I should
trade up to a better object of love whenever one is available. This is
starkly at odds with the loyalty, or attachment to an individual as an
individual, that many think essential to love and that is recognized
in Broad&rsquo;s self-referential altruism; it is a strangely
impersonal view of personal love. None of this means that a more
adequate account of love cannot be constructed with the same basic
structure as Moore&rsquo;s; it can. It will hold that personal love
involves a wider range of positive attitudes to goods in a loved
one&rsquo;s life, including actively promoting as well as passively
admiring them; will recognize a wider range of such goods, including
the loved one&rsquo;s happiness, knowledge, and achievement rather
than just her aesthetic awareness; and will take goods in her life to
have greater value from your point of view than do the similar goods
of strangers, so loving them is more appropriate and therefore
intrinsically better. But Moore was prevented from giving this account
by other features of his view, such as his general emphasis on
contemplative forms of love, his restricted list of initial goods, and
his strict impartialism about value.</p>

<h2 id="Infl">5. Influence</h2>

<p>
Despite not always containing entirely new ideas, Moore&rsquo;s
ethical writings, and especially <em>Principia Ethica</em>, were
extremely influential, both outside and within philosophy. Outside
philosophy one influence was through the literary and artistic figures
in the Bloomsbury Group, such as Keynes, Lytton Strachey, and Leonard
and Virginia Woolf, several of whom had come to know Moore while
members with him of the exclusive Apostles society at Cambridge. They
were most impressed by the last chapter of <em>Principia Ethica</em>,
whose identification of aesthetic appreciation and personal love as
the highest goods very much fit their own predilections. Keynes said
the book&rsquo;s publication was for them &ldquo;the opening of a new
heaven on a new earth&rdquo; and that its theory of the good became
for a time their &ldquo;religion&rdquo; (1949: 82) Many of them
&ndash; the gay men in particular &ndash; sexualized Moore&rsquo;s
account of love, adding an erotic element not present in his
formulations. But according to Keynes (though Leonard Woolf (1960:
146&ndash;49) disagreed), they tended to ignore the impartial
consequentialism within which he embedded those goods, concentrating
on pursuing them just in their own lives rather than encouraging their
wider spread in society. The novels of E.M. Forster, another Apostle,
contain several figures representing Moorean ideas, for example the
Schlegel sisters in <em>Howards End</em> (Sidorsky 2007). An important
element in <em>Principia Ethica</em>&rsquo;s extra-philosophical
appeal was its brash iconoclasm, its claiming, however inaccurately,
to sweep away all past moral philosophy. This tone entirely fit its
time, when the death of Queen Victoria had led many in Britain to
think a new, more progressive age was dawning.</p>

<p>
The book&rsquo;s influence within philosophy was even greater. On the
normative side, views close to its ideal consequentialism remained
prominent and even dominant, at least in Britain, until the 1930s,
though it is hard to know how far this is attributable to Moore
himself since similar views had been accepted before him, for example
by Rashdall and McTaggart and, with a difference in style, by Green
and Bradley. In metaethics his non-naturalism likewise remained
dominant for several decades, though here Moore played a larger role,
especially for later writers, in part because of his general
philosophical eminence and in part because of the vigor with which he
presented the view. By talking explicitly of non-natural properties he
at least seemed to give non-naturalism a more robust metaphysical side
than predecessors such as Sidgwick had, and he defended the view more
emphatically, in particular by putting more weight on the
open-question argument. When Sidgwick noticed Bentham or Spencer
equating goodness with a natural property such as pleasure, he thought
it a minor slip that ought in charity to be ignored; Moore thought it
a decisive error that vitiated that philosopher&rsquo;s entire system.
By so emphasizing the two elements of non-naturalism &ndash; its
realism and its commitment to the autonomy of ethics &ndash; Moore
helped initiate an oft-remarked sequence of developments in
20<sup>th</sup>-century metaethics (see Warnock 1967; Hudson 1970;
Sinclair 2018a).</p>

<p>
The first reaction to non-naturalism, other than simple acceptance,
came from philosophers who endorsed the autonomy of ethics but,
sometimes under the influence of logical positivism, rejected its
moral realism, holding instead that there are no facts other than
natural ones and no modes of knowing other than the empirical and the
strictly logical. They therefore developed various versions of
non-cognitivism, which hold that moral judgements are not true or
false but either express attitudes, as in emotivism (Ayer 1936;
Stevenson 1944), or issue something like imperatives, as in
prescriptivism (Hare 1952; Hare 1963). Unlike the subjective
naturalism Moore criticized in <em>Ethics</em>, these views allow
moral disagreement, since attitudes and imperatives can oppose each
other, for example as positive versus negative. They also, their later
defenders held, give a better explanation of the open-question
argument, since they find a distinctive emotive or action-guiding
force in moral concepts and judgements that is not present in
non-moral ones; that is why, they said, the normative is neither
reducible to nor derivable from the non-normative. Non-cognitivism can
also explain, some said, why morality matters to us as it does.
Non-naturalism implies that moral judgements concern a mysterious type
of property, but why should facts about that property be important to
us or influence our behavior? If moral judgements express deep-seated
attitudes, however, the question answers itself.</p>

<p>
A later reaction, starting around the mid-century, rejected both
non-naturalism and non-cognitivism and explored versions of
naturalism, including a neo-Aristotelian one that grounds all ethical
demands in a conception of human flourishing, or of the development of
a human nature understood in quasi-biological terms, that included the
standard moral virtues as constituents (Anscombe 1958; Foot 2001);
this view implicitly denies the autonomy of ethics. It sometimes went
with another movement that began around mid-century, that of rejecting
the very idea of a concept or property of the (simply) intrinsically
good that, though hardly unique to Moore &ndash; since it goes back to
Plato &ndash; was especially associated with him. Here one claim was
that predicative uses of &ldquo;good,&rdquo; as in Moore&rsquo;s
&ldquo;aesthetic appreciation is good,&rdquo; are ungrammatical, since
the only legitimate uses of the term in English are at least
implicitly attributive, attaching &ldquo;good&rdquo; to some sortal
term as in &ldquo;good knife,&rdquo; &ldquo;good liar,&rdquo; and,
most relevantly to the neo-Aristotelian view, &ldquo;good human
being&rdquo; (Geach 1956; also Thomson 1997, Thomson 2003). But,
though initially made at the high-water mark of ordinary-language
philosophy, this claim about English grammar seems plainly false: the
language has always allowed free-standing predicative uses of
&ldquo;good,&rdquo; from the King James translation of Genesis &ndash;
&ldquo;God saw the light, that it was good&rdquo; (cited in Butchvarov
1989: 17) &ndash; to everyday phrases such as &ldquo;It is good that
&hellip;&rdquo; Moore&rsquo;s moral philosophy cannot credibly be
dismissed as resting on a crude linguistic error (see e.g. Pigden
1990; Zimmerman 1999; Kraut 2011: 173&ndash;83; Cosker-Rowland 2016;
Tucker 2018). Moreover a view centred on the attributive use of
&ldquo;good&rdquo; has to explain why &ldquo;good human being&rdquo;
or &ldquo;good person&rdquo; has ethical implications, ones about how
we should act, that &ldquo;good knife&rdquo; and especially
&ldquo;good liar&rdquo; do not. It cannot say, as a Moorean would,
that the things that make you a good human being, such as benevolent
desires and feelings, are simply intrinsically good while those that
make for a good knife or good liar are not. But what then can it
say?</p>

<p>
A related claim rejected Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;(simply) good&rdquo; in
favour of &ldquo;good for,&rdquo; not in the agent-relative sense
Sidgwick used to formulate egoism but in a different one associated
with &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; or &ldquo;prudential value&rdquo; and
also intended to supplant his &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Its proponents might
grant that talk of the simply good is perfectly grammatical but argue
that it makes no useful contribution to ethical thought, which goes
better with &ldquo;good for&rdquo; as its only evaluative concept
(Kraut 2011). The resulting view may be another version of
neo-Aristotelianism (Kraut 2007) but then it can be asked, among other
things, how it can compare the good-fors of different species or
explain why, if you can either save a human&rsquo;s life or save a
cat, you should save the human. It cannot say, as a Moorean would,
that the human has capacities whose development is simply better than
that of the cat&rsquo;s, but then, again, what can it say? A less
radical view accepts &ldquo;simply good&rdquo; but says it cannot be
the only evaluative concept, as in Moore, but needs to be supplemented
by &ldquo;good for.&rdquo; We should indeed promote what is simply
intrinsically good, but that is largely or even exclusively what is
good for, or constitutes the well-being of, human and other sentient
beings (e.g. Sumner 1996). Here a view sympathetic to Moore can ask
what substantive contribution &ldquo;good for&rdquo; makes to this
view: if the states of a person we are to promote are, ultimately,
simply good, what exactly is added by saying they are also good for
him? Especially recently, there have been several more general
defences of Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;(simply) good&rdquo; against the
supposedly distinct &ldquo;good for&rdquo; concept, often with
endorsement of his own locative analysis of &ldquo;good for&rdquo; as
&ldquo;good and located in the life of&rdquo; (e.g. Regan 2004;
Fletcher 2012; McDaniel 2014; Hurka 2021).</p>

<p>
Another later reaction, sometimes associated with the first
neo-Aristotelian view and like it influenced by Wittgenstein, rejected
the calculating side of Moore&rsquo;s consequentialism, which
identifies right and wrong acts by adding up the goods and evils in
their consequences. Moral judgements, some argued, cannot be codified
or theorized in this way but instead call for ethically trained and
sensitive insight into particular situations as particular (e.g.
McDowell 1979); this view also rejected more sytematized versions of
deontology such as those of Kant and Ross. Even apart from this
anti-theory view there was, in many circles, skepticism about the
supposed extravagance and dogmatism of Moore&rsquo;s substantive
claims about the good &ndash; such as his specific valuings of
aesthetic appreciation and personal love &ndash; and a preference for
the allegedly more modest view that what is good in people&rsquo;s
lives is just the fulfilment of whatever desires they have. By the
1960s, it seems fair to say, many of Moore&rsquo;s views were thought
deeply problematic and his moral philosophy as a whole was not an
especially live option. It was still thought important to read
<em>Principia Ethica</em>, or at least its first chapter, as having
initiated the sequence of developments that led to the then-current
views. But from the standpoint of many of those views Moore&rsquo;s
general approach to ethics was at key points misguided.</p>

<p>
Fifty-plus years later the philosophical climate is more favorable to
Moore. A number of philosophers now defend metaethical non-naturalism
(e.g. Shafer-Landau 2003; Huemer 2006), either in versions they say
are ontologically minimalist (Nagel 1986; Scanlon 1998, 2014; Parfit
2011, vol. 2: 464&ndash;87) or in ones they present as more robust
(Enoch 2011), but all embracing some account of normative truth that
separates it from non-normative, for example scientific, truth. In
addition, and of necessity, these current versions of non-naturalism
share something close to Moore&rsquo;s moral epistemology, his view
that normative truths are known by a kind of direct insight or
intuition, though the present-day views are often more explicitly
fallibilist and coherentist than his sometimes appeared to be (e.g.
Audi 2004). Still, for many philosophers Moore&rsquo;s version of
non-naturalist realism remains the best-known or canonical one.
Moreover, as noted above, there has been increasing pushback to the
claim that talk of the &ldquo;simply good,&rdquo; as against
&ldquo;good <em>F</em> or good for,&rdquo; is somehow problematic, or
more acceptance of Moore&rsquo;s conceptual framework. In normative
ethics, too, there is increasing sympathy for accounts of the good
with an ideal or perfectionist content and admiration for particular
features of Moore&rsquo;s own account, such as his valuing of personal
love, his recursive principles (Hurka 2001), and his principle of
organic unities. Moorean ideas still have many rivals, including many
that reject, for example, his consequentialism and impartialism. And
often what present-day philosophers take from Moore is just an
individual idea or argument rather than his theory as a whole (Regan
2003 is an exception). But whereas in the early 20th century
Moore&rsquo;s approach to ethics, and especially to metaethics, was
dominant, at least in British moral philosophy, and whereas in the
mid-century it was commonly dismissed, it today represents, at several
points, a live contributor to ongoing ethical debates.</p>
