<h1>Constructivism in Metaethics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Sep 27, 2011; substantive revision Thu Nov 6, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Metaethical constructivism is the view that insofar as there are
normative truths, they are not fixed by normative facts that are
independent of what rational agents would agree to under some
specified conditions of choice. The appeal of this view lies in the
promise to explain how normative truths are objective and independent
of our actual judgments, while also binding and authoritative for
us.</p>

<p>
Constructivism takes different forms. Some versions seek to explain
all normative reasons or normative truths, while others are limited to
moral reasons, moral obligations, or moral truths. Their relation to
the traditional classifications of metaethics is problematic,
particularly with respect to the realism&ndash;antirealism debate.
These disputes reflect deeper divergences concerning the very
definition of metaethics, the relation between normative and
metaethical claims, and the methods thought to be distinctive of
metaethical inquiry. In what follows, varieties of metaethical
constructivism will be considered by focusing on the specific
questions that constructivist theories are designed to address.</p>

<p>
Moral constructivism has also be advanced as a normative theory of
justification: it holds that the moral principles we ought to accept
are those that agents would agree to, or endorse, under conditions of
hypothetical or idealized rational deliberation. Constructivists,
however, differ in how they conceive of such deliberation. Some follow
adaptations of Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative, while others draw
on contractualist approaches, or adopt the method of reflective
equilibrium.</p>

<p>
Section 1 sets out the core claims and underlying motivations of
constructivism. Sections 2 and 3 examine two main varieties of
metaethical constructivism while section 4 turns to hybrid theories
that integrate central constructivist commitments with
non-constructivist elements. Section 5 discusses the position of
constructivism within the metaethical debate. Section 6 offers a
critical assessment of its constitutivist strategies, and section 7
provides concluding remarks.</p>

<h2 id="WhaCon">1. What is Constructivism?</h2>

<p>
The term &lsquo;constructivism&rsquo; entered debates in moral theory
with John Rawls&rsquo; seminal Dewey Lectures &ldquo;Kantian
Constructivism in Moral Theory&rdquo; (Rawls 1980), wherein Rawls
offered a reinterpretation of the philosopher Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s
ethics and of its relevance for political debates.</p>

<p>
According to Rawls, these debates fail to effectively address the
political problem of ethical disagreements because they adopt
metaphysical standards of objectivity, which appeal to the independent
reality and truth of values. In his view, such standards are
inadequate to address disagreement in a political debate in which all
the parties in the dispute claim to be defending the only true view,
because they lead to a stalemate in the discussion, with each party
accusing its opponent of being &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to the moral
truth.</p>

<p>
Rawls is especially concerned with coordination problems that arise in
pluralistic contexts, wherein citizens hold different and to some
extent incommensurable moral views. The need for objectivity,
according to Rawls, is <em>practical</em>: it arises in contexts in
which people disagree about what to value and need to reach an
agreement about what to do. He attributes to Kant the idea that we
ought to approach objectivity as a practical problem and that we can
fruitfully address moral disputes by reasoning about them (Rawls 1971:
34, 39&ndash;40, 49&ndash;52). Rawls thus turns to Kant in order to
argue for a conception of objectivity that is not metaphysical, that
is, a conception of objectivity that avoids claims to universal and
fundamental moral truths that are independent of our fully rational
judgments. On this conception, nobody is assumed to have a privileged
access to moral truth, but all have equal standing in reasoning about
what to do. To this extent, Kant&rsquo;s theory is regarded as
providing a metaethical alternative both to realism and skepticism
about the existence and nature of moral truths.</p>

<p>
Rawls&rsquo; account of Kantian constructivism in moral theory (1980)
generated a large literature, and produced several varieties of
constructivism. Some of these views depart from Rawls&rsquo; own
conception of constructivism.</p>

<h2 id="VarKanCon">2. Varieties of Kantian Constructivism</h2>

<p>
Kantian constructivism is defended in a variety of ways, but its
distinguishing feature is that it understands the nature of moral and
normative truths based on considerations about practical reason and
its relation to agency, although some focus on rational agency as such
while others take into account also embodiment and social
embeddedness. On this view, reasons for being moral do not spring from
our interests or desires; instead, they are rooted in our nature as
rational agents. Insofar as moral obligations are justified in terms
of rational requirements, they are universally and necessarily binding
for all rational beings. Because of its claim about the universal
authority of reason and obligations, Kantian Constructivism is
regarded as the most ambitious form of metaethical constructivism. In
this section, we will consider three main varieties, starting with the
constructivist interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s ethics.</p>

<h3 id="KanCon">2.1 Kant&rsquo;s Constructivism</h3>

<p>
John Rawls first advanced a constructivist interpretation of
Kant&rsquo;s account of practical reason and moral obligation (1980,
2000). On his reading, the novelty of Kant&rsquo;s view commits him to
constructivism, best appreciated against rival accounts of obligation
(Rawls 1980, 1989, 2000). According to Kant, all previous ethical
theories fail to account for the objectivity and authority of moral
obligation because they fail to explain how reason plays a role in our
lives because they misunderstand its practical function and
mischaracterize its relation with the ends of choice (Kant G 4:
441&ndash;444; C2 5: 35&ndash;41, 153, 157). Kant&rsquo;s arguments
specifically address sentimentalism and &lsquo;dogmatic
rationalism&rsquo;. Sentimentalism, championed by Francis Hutcheson,
David Hume, and Adam Smith, holds that ethical judgments stem from
sentiments and regards reason as incapable of moving us to action on
its own. According to the sentimentalist, the role of reason is solely
instrumental. That is, reason merely finds the means to satisfy an
agent&rsquo;s ends, and it is not capable of indicating which ends are
worth pursuing. This claim exposes sentimentalism as a
&ldquo;heteronomous&rdquo; doctrine, which fails to establish the
objectivity of moral obligations. This is because sentimentalism
treats moral obligations as conditional upon our interests, and thus
as having limited authority.</p>

<p>
Kant raises an analogous objection against dogmatic rationalism,
championed by Christian Wolff and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, which
asserts that there are moral truths accessible by rational insight
(Kant G 4: 443; Rawls 2000: 50, 228). This view represents an
intuitionist form of moral realism according to which reason
recognizes objective values or moral ends that exist prior to and
independently of our reasoning and of the kinds of agents that we are.
The function of reason is to identify these moral truths without
itself participating in their formation or determining their content.
The question arises how such pre-fixed moral ends are authoritative
over us and action guiding. The answer must be that moral truths guide
us only on the condition that we have a corresponding desire to be
guided by what is rational (Rawls 1980: 343&ndash;46; Rawls 1989:
510&ndash;13). By narrowing the function of reason in this way,
Kant&rsquo;s point is that dogmatic rationalism fails to secure the
conclusion that moral obligations have unconditional authority over us
(Kant G, 4: 441). This is because, for dogmatic rationalism, moral
truths guide us only on the condition that we have a corresponding
desire to be guided by what is rational (Rawls 1980: 343&ndash;46;
Rawls 1989: 510&ndash;13).</p>

<p>
Kant&rsquo;s general diagnosis is that all such doctrines fail to
capture the practical function of reason because they are
heteronomous. They deny the authority and efficacy of reason, either
holding that reason can only recognize objective ends that exist
independently of its operations, or claiming that reason can bind
agents only with the help of inclination or interest. For Kant
heteronomy is a form of moral skepticism, understood as skepticism
about the power of reason to establish moral truths and their
authority. On this reading, then, constructivism is part of
Kant&rsquo;s overall argument for grounding ethics in reason, against
the skeptical view that there are no normative truths (Korsgaard
1996a; Stern 2013; Wallace 2012). Skepticism is avoided only if reason
is accounted as autonomous, and its authority does not derive from
anything outside it. Reason is autonomous if its authority rests on
its proper activity, rather than being derived from elements of the
world outside of reason. Thus, the norm governing the activity of
reason must be internal to reason, rather than dependent on any given
value, interest, or desire. That is to say that reason is a
&ldquo;self-legislative activity&rdquo; (Kant G 4: &sect;2), and its
legislative activity is governed by a norm, which Kant calls the
&lsquo;Categorical Imperative.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
The Categorical Imperative expresses the autonomy of reason and is its
governing principle. It is not a mere decision-procedure to determine
what to do, but the &lsquo;constitutive norm&rsquo; of reason, that
is, the basic standard of rationality in thinking and acting (Rawls
1989: 498&ndash;506; Rawls 2000: 166, 240&ndash;244; Korsgaard 1996a:
36&ndash;37; O&rsquo;Neill 1989b: 18&ndash;19, 59n, 128, 180; Reath
2006: 221&ndash;222; Reath &amp; Timmermann 2010; Engstrom 2009:
Chapter 5; Turan 2019). The Categorical Imperative comes in different
formulations that Kant regards as equivalent (G 4: 421, 429, 431,
433); ultimately, it is the requirement that in deliberating, we test
our motives by considering whether the principle they express can be
adopted as a universal law, a principle that applies to and binds all
agents endowed with rational capacities. To this extent, Kant is
committed to the &ldquo;constitutivist view&rdquo; that the source of
the categorical force of moral obligations lies in the constitutive
features of rational agency (Rawls 2000: 263&ndash;265; O&rsquo;Neill
1989a, Korsgaard 1996a: 236ff). We will return to this point in
section 6.3.</p>

<p>
Scholars are divided about the constructivist interpretation of
Kant&rsquo;s theory of practical reason, even though nobody denies
that, for Kant, the laws of the mind are laws of reason (compare Guyer
2013 and Engstrom 2013). The most general source of reservations is
that constructivism builds upon the critique of realism, but
Kant&rsquo;s claims about objective moral knowledge seem best
vindicated by moral realism (Schmidt and Santos 2017). Some doubt that
moral realism is Kant&rsquo;s own intended target, hence suggesting
that Kant&rsquo;s constructivism does not build upon a critique of
moral realism (Stern 2012a: 7&ndash;68, 2012b; Schmidt &amp; Santos
2017). A related contested issue is whether Kantian constructivism
radically departs from perfectionism or entails it (Pollock 2017,
forthcoming; cf. Zylberman forthcoming; Reath forthcoming). It should
be noted, however, that in this dispute, constructivism is generally
taken to be a form of antirealism (Ameriks 2003: 268, 274; Wood 2008:
108, 337, 374&ndash;375; Thorpe 2019; Vesper 2020; Rodriguez 2022),
while Rawls introduced Kant&rsquo;s constructivism as a distinct
alternative to both realism and antirealism, where the latter includes
subjectivism and relativism (Rawls 1980; O&rsquo;Neill 1989a: 1;
Engstrom 2013: 138ff; Bernstein 2025).</p>

<p>
According to realist interpreters, Kant&rsquo;s defense of the
autonomy of reason takes place within a realist foundationalist
project grounded on the absolute value of humanity (Wood 1999: 157,
114; Rauscher 2002; Langton 2007; Johnson 2007; Hills 2008; Krasnoff
1999; Kain 2006a, Kain 2006b; Irwin 2009; Galvin 2011; Lyons 2020;
Scholten 2020). First, critics point out that Kant&rsquo;s defense
provides a transcendental argument, an argument that highlights the
conditions under which it is possible for something to be the case.
The value of humanity is the condition of the possibility of all
valuing. The issue revolves around the nature of transcendental
arguments, and whether they commit us to moral realism (Stern 2000;
Larmore 2008: 121; Watkins &amp; Fitzpatrick 2002; Fitzpatrick 2005;
Tiffany 2006; Brum, Stern, &amp; Werner 2017), something that
constructivists deny. Realist critics also dispute the force and the
scope of the argument for the autonomy of practical reason, a debate
that partly stems from differing assessments of the constitutivist
strategies, which will be discussed in sections 6.2 and 6.3.</p>

<p>
Second, realist critics hold that Kant&rsquo;s claim in the
<em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> that we are immediately
conscious of the moral law as a &ldquo;fact of reason&rdquo;, (C2
5:46&ndash;48) represents a realist foundation of morality (Ameriks
2003: 263&ndash;282; Kleingeld 2010: 55&ndash;72). By contrast,
constructivist interpreters tend to downplay the role of the fact of
reason in Kant&rsquo;s general argument for the objectivity of moral
obligations (O&rsquo;Neill 2002: 81&ndash;97; &#321;uk&oacute;w 1993:
204&ndash;221). Rawls takes the fact of reason to show that Kant
develops &ldquo;not only a constructivist conception of practical
reason, but a coherentist account of its authentication&rdquo; (Rawls
1999: 524; Rawls 2000: 268&ndash;273). In his view, the fact of reason
indicates that the deliverances of practical reason cohere with our
moral experience. This congruence is an integral part of Kant&rsquo;s
vindication of ethical objectivity, but it is no commitment to
realism. Rather, it simply confirms that there is no discrepancy
between the requirements of practical reason (which are expressed by
the Categorical Imperative) and our ordinary experience of morality
(Rawls 1980: 340; Rawls 1989: 523&ndash;524; Rawls 2000:
253&ndash;272, 268, 273; Kant C2, 5: 15). For Rawls, the realist
notion of objectivity is &ldquo;unnecessary for objectivity&rdquo;
(1980: 570). However, his argument in support of a coherentist
conception of practical reason is found too weak to capture
Kant&rsquo;s view of moral obligations as objective rational
requirements (Larmore 2008: 83&ndash;84; Stern 2012a: 7&ndash;40). As
an alternative to these readings, some interpreters argue that Kant is
constructivist about the authority of moral obligations and practical
laws for finite agents, but not about the contents of such laws, which
apply to all rational agents as such (Engstrom 2009, 2013; Sensen
2013). For others, Kant is a constructivist about a limited set of
general substantive moral principles &ndash; and as a constititutivist
about moral authority (Reath 2022). According to Schafer, Kant&rsquo;s
constitutivism is more appropriately interpreted as
&lsquo;reason-first&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;agent-first&rsquo;
(Schafer 2019, 179). On this reading, the constitutive basis of
normativity is located not in the rational agent, but in rational
activity as such. This thesis is broadly shared within Kantian
scholarship (cf. Reath forthcoming). What remains contentious,
however, is Schafer&rsquo;s proposed shift in focus from
&lsquo;autonomy&rsquo; to &lsquo;understanding&rsquo; in explicating
rational activity (Schafer 2023, cf. O&rsquo;Neill 1989, 2015; Sensen
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Constructivist interpreters have largely deemphasized the metaphysical
implications of Kant&rsquo;s ethics in order to highlight his
recognition of the limits of finite agency and to foreground the
rational basis of morality as a fundamentally cooperative enterprise.
Kant embarks on the project of vindicating reasoning, starting from
very modest considerations about rational agency. Such starting points
are not sufficient &ldquo;to sustain or revive classical philosophical
ambitions to build vast metaphysical structures on reason alone&rdquo;
(O&rsquo;Neill 2015: 3; C1: A xiii; cf. Schneewind 1970). The
constructivist interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s ethics highlights the
cooperative nature of the standards of reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s repeated use of metaphors of <em>construction</em>
and <em>collaboration</em> in his discussion of reasoning make it
natural to speak of his approach and method as
<em>constructivist</em>, and of his aim as the <em>construction</em>
of reason&rsquo;s authority, and thereby of a basis for offering
others reasons for truth claims and moral claims, reasons for
favouring some rather than other practical and political aims.&rdquo;
(O&rsquo;Neill 2015: 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ultimately, the standards of reasoning are justified by a practical
cooperative function: &ldquo;it must exhibit patterns that others
could discern, and thus it must be law-like&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Neill
2015: 4).</p>

<h3 id="ConProRea">2.2 Constructivism as Procedural Realism</h3>

<p>
The antimetaphysical orientation of constructivism is central to
leading defenses of metaethical constructivism. Christine Korsgaard
characterizes Kantian constructivism as a form of &ldquo;procedural
realism&rdquo; &ndash; the view that &ldquo;there are answers to moral
questions <em>because</em> there are correct procedures for arriving
at them&rdquo;; and she contrasts procedural realism with
&ldquo;substantive realism&rdquo; &ndash; the view that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there are correct procedures for answering moral questions
<em>because</em> there are moral truths or facts, which exist
independently of those procedures, and which those procedures track.
(Korsgaard 1996a: 36&ndash;37, see also Korsgaard 1983: 183)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Substantive realism holds that moral judgments have objective criteria
of correctness only if they represent facts about the world.
Constructivism, by contrast, claims that such criteria arise from
objective standards of reasoning about practical matters. Thus,
reasons against deception and manipulation are generated through
practical reasoning rather than discovered by empirical investigation,
grasped by the intellect, or revealed by some god. What makes this
view Kantian is that practical reasoning has a single criterion
&ndash; the Categorical Imperative &ndash; through which moral
obligations, as requirements of reason, are objectively grounded.</p>

<p>
Korsgaard&rsquo;s defense of constructivism parallels Kant&rsquo;s
case for the autonomy of practical reason, as reconstructed by Rawls.
She argues that substantive realism cannot answer the skeptic who
denies that there are reasons to be moral, since realism merely
presupposes objective standards without justifying them. Hence it
fails to explain the authority of moral obligations (Korsgaard 1996a;
Korsgaard 2008: 30&ndash;31, 55&ndash;57, 67&ndash;68; Stern 2012a;
Brady 2002). Realists claim that reasons must be anchored in normative
facts, yet such facts cannot explain how they bind or motivate
rational agents. If it is a normative fact that deception is wrong,
how does that fact compel us to refrain from deceiving? This is not
just a psychological question about motivation, but a normative
question about authority.</p>

<p>
For Korsgaard, humans are reflective agents, able to step back from
their thoughts and desires and question their legitimacy (1996a:
10&ndash;11, 17, 93). Reflection suspends the authority of given
attitudes and allows agents to ask what there is reason to do or
believe. Because they are reflective, humans form ideals of the
persons they aspire to be and can guide themselves accordingly. Their
capacity for self-governance lies in endorsing universal standards,
and the proper form of such governance is self-legislation (Korsgaard
1996a: 36, 91, 231&ndash;232; Korsgaard 2008: 3).</p>

<p>
Rational agents are guided by universal principles they have
legislated. This does not mean, however, that individuals arbitrarily
determine the moral law; otherwise, evil people would not be bound by
it (Korsgaard 1996a: 234&ndash;235; O&rsquo;Neill 2003c; Reath 2006:
92&ndash;170, 112&ndash;113; Korsgaard 2008: 207&ndash;229). Rather,
the moral law obliges only insofar as it is self-legislated: agents
can act autonomously on moral requirements only if they legislate
them. Universal principles ensure that action expresses integrity
rather than unreflective preferences or desires, since they are
constitutive of rational agency. By contrast, agents who act
mindlessly or compulsively lack this integrity. Still, rational agents
may permissibly act on desires that endure reflective scrutiny.</p>

<p>
A canonical objection to grounding morality solely in rationality is
that it neglects the special bonds with loved ones, and thus fails to
capture integrity and morality (Williams 1981: chs. 1&ndash;2). To
address this, Korsgaard introduces &ldquo;practical identities,&rdquo;
roles that serve as sources of special obligations (Korsgaard 1996a:
101, &sect;3.3.1; 2009: 20). For example, Camille values herself under
the descriptions of artist, French citizen, and Auguste&rsquo;s lover.
These identities guide her choices, sustain her integrity, and
generate special obligations to pupils, compatriots, and friends. Yet
such roles bind us only when reflectively endorsed (Korsgaard 1996a:
&sect;3.3.1; 2009: 22). Reflective endorsement requires testing
loyalties against the principle of universality, which commits us to
morality. Thus, to value ourselves under particular descriptions, we
must also value humanity in ourselves and others (Korsgaard 2008:
Lecture 6, 25&ndash;26).</p>

<p>
Korsgaard (1996a) offers a transcendental argument that what we ought
to do is justified by the norms constitutive of rational agency.
Valuing humanity &ndash; understood as the capacity for rationality
&ndash; is the condition of valuing anything at all (1996a:
121&ndash;123; 1998: 60&ndash;62). In deliberation we confer value on
our ends, thereby attributing value to ourselves. Hence, the value of
objects depends on the rational capacity of evaluators, and
&lsquo;humanity&rsquo; names an unconditional value. We must value
humanity in ourselves and others on pain of incoherence. Practical
identities alone cannot sustain integrity when they conflict with this
requirement: a Mafioso, for example, cannot justify his conduct on
universal principles and thus fails as a rational agent. Integrity,
necessary for agency, requires commitment to morality grounded in
reason.</p>

<p>
Some critics argue that Korsgaard&rsquo;s argument tacitly rests on a
realist premise regarding the value of humanity, and thus it is not a
complete alternative to moral realism (Watkins &amp; Fitzpatrick 2002;
Fitzpatrick 2005; Ridge 2005; Stieb 2006; Kain 2006a, Kain 2006b;
Papish 2011; O&rsquo;Shea 2015; Schafer 2015a), nor does it offer a
distinctive reply to skeptical challenges to ethical objectivity.
Others find Korsgaard&rsquo;s argument vulnerable to the objection of
&lsquo;regress on conditions&rsquo;, which shows that it is not
logically necessary that the condition of a thing&rsquo;s value be
valuable itself (Rabinowicz &amp; R&oslash;nnow- Rasmussen 2000;
Kerstein 2001; Ridge 2005; Coleman 2006). If so, humanity may be the
condition of the possibility of value and yet lack value itself.</p>

<p>
Korsgaard replies that &ldquo;there need be no such regress if there
are principles that are constitutive of the very rational activities
that we trying to perform&rdquo; (2008: 5, 1996b: 164&ndash;67, 2009).
Indeed, some of these objections overlook the distinction between
substantive realism and constitutivism (or structural realism, Nozick
1981:545&ndash;551); nevertheless, the question of the realist
implications of constitutivist strategies resurfaces.</p>

<p>
For Korsgaard, the principles of practical rationality are
constitutive of rational agency, in the sense that they are standards
arising from and justified by the nature of the object in question
(i.e., the rational agent). More specifically, unless the object
conforms to the standard, it ceases to be the kind of object that it
is (&lsquo;<em>constitution</em> requirement&rsquo;). If the function
of the house is to serve as a habitable shelter, then it must conform
to the standard of being a habitable shelter. A thing that does not
serve this purpose is not a house. Secondly, some objects make
themselves into the kind of objects that they are by conforming to
their constitutive standards (&lsquo;<em>self-constitution</em>
requirement&rsquo;). Rational agents make things happen, that is, they
are efficacious. They exert their efficacy in a specific way, i.e.,
autonomously. Autonomous agents must conform to the categorical
imperative, and in order to be efficacious, they must conform to the
hypothetical imperative. It is by conforming to these principles,
Korsgaard argues, that one makes oneself into an agent.</p>

<p>
Her more recent works point toward a new direction in the debate about
constructivism, which combines Aristotelian and Kantian features
(Korsgaard 2008, 2009). However, in her view, Kantian constitutivism
uniquely captures the requirement of self-constitution, a feature
absent from the Aristotelian conception of virtue as excellence of
character (Korsgaard 2019). The Kantian idea of self-constitution is
thus indispensable for any adequate account of rational &ndash; and
thereby moral &ndash; agency.</p>

<p>
Korsgaard&rsquo;s constitutivist strategy of grounding moral
normativity in the constitutive features of agency raises worries that
will be discussed in sections 6.2&ndash;6.3.</p>

<h3 id="ConForFinRatAge">2.3 Constructivism for Finite Rational Agents</h3>

<p>
Onora O&rsquo;Neill defines metaethical constructivism as a third
alternative between realism and subjectivism (O&rsquo;Neill 1989b:
279). She departs from the versions of Kantian constructivism
discussed above because she makes no appeal to transcendental
arguments and rejects the idealized conceptions of rational agency
that are at play in other versions of Kantian constructivism. In her
view, &ldquo;finite rational beings&rdquo; should not be construed as
&ldquo;beings whose rationality is finite&rdquo;, but as &ldquo;finite
beings who are rational&rdquo;. Finitude does not entail any
limitation on strategic reasoning, even though there is no way to
establish that finite rational agents have access to all sorts of
reasoning that infinite or disembodied rational agents may have. The
key thesis is that instrumental principles are not the only principles
of rationality, and more importantly, they never operate in isolation
(O&rsquo;Neill 1989b: 74).</p>

<p>
According to O&rsquo;Neill, this more austere constructivism is closer
to Kant&rsquo;s own theory than other varieties (O&rsquo;Neill 1989a;
O&rsquo;Neill 2015). In her view, Kant&rsquo;s constructivism is
motivated by the vivid awareness of interdependency, finitude, and
mutual vulnerability. Humans are prone to mistakenly rely on claims
that are not warranted, and thus they need to check and criticize the
unjustified and arbitrary assumptions they make in reasoning
(O&rsquo;Neill 1989b). O&rsquo;Neill shares Kant&rsquo;s claim
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
reasoning is fundamentally practical: it aims to provide
<em>standards</em> or <em>norms</em> that thought, action and
communication can (but often fail) to meet. (O&rsquo;Neill 2015:
2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Second, she shares Kant&rsquo;s view that reasoning is necessary
because humans are finite and interdependent beings. Third, she agrees
that the principles of reason are not given by intuition or
introspection but must be discerned through the exercise of rational
powers. Finally, she accepts Kant&rsquo;s claim that norms of
reasoning must be universal if they are to fulfil their function.</p>

<p>
The difference lies in how universality is justified. For
O&rsquo;Neill, universality is required because reasoning must be
shared among a plurality of finite, interdependent agents whose action
and communication are not antecedently coordinated (by instinct,
providence, or law). The requirement of universality &ndash; or
followability &ndash; thus sets minimal constraints on what counts as
reasoning (O&rsquo;Neill 2015: 3). From this it follows that no
plurality of agents can coherently adopt principles that destroy or
undermine the agency of any of its members (O&rsquo;Neill 1989a: 10;
see also 1989b, 2015). Hence practical reasoning justifies the
prohibition of harming, coercing, and deceiving others.</p>

<p>
This is not to suggest that the requirement of followability can
resolve all moral questions or fully determine duties. O&rsquo;Neill
holds that many issues demand further substantive argument. Still, her
account promises to vindicate reason&rsquo;s capacity &ndash; and
authority &ndash; to distinguish genuine justification from mere
rationalization. While &lsquo;contractualism&rsquo; is often linked to
metaethical constructivism (Rawls 1971; Scanlon 1998; Hill 1989, 2001;
Milo 1995), and many regard construction itself as a hypothetical
procedure akin to contract (see e.g., Darwall, Gibbard, &amp; Railton
1997: 13; Hill 2001, 2002; Walden 2012; cf. O&rsquo;Neill 2003a,b;
Street 2010: 365), offers a sharp account of the difference between
Kantian constructivism and contractualism in terms of their scope,
audience, and ambitions. Kantian constructivism holds that practical
reasoning yields unconditionally authoritative moral claims, whereas
contractualism does not.</p>

<p>
O&rsquo;Neill agrees with Kant that only reason itself can verify the
credentials of its own claims. The process of identifying the
principles of reason is avowedly circular, yet this circularity is not
problematic, since the process of verification is reflexive: it
involves reason critiquing the claims of reason itself. More
specifically, the critique of reason uncovers a basic principle of
reasoning: we should rely only on principles that other rational
agents can share. The authority of reason is thus conferred through
public communication among free, rational agents, and lies in the fact
that the principles governing our thought are neither self-serving nor
self-defeating. We learn what these principles require by submitting
our claims to free and critical debate, the practice that constitutes
&ldquo;the public use of reason&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Neill 1989b:
70&ndash;71, 206).</p>

<p>
Since the critique of reason is a continuous, progressive, and
reflexive process, reason has a history that coincides with the
development of practices of tolerance and mutual recognition
(O&rsquo;Neill 1999: 174, 2002). Such practices establish the
authority of reason. This &lsquo;developmental&rsquo; view of
practical reason and its autonomy accounts for change and progress,
and provides a significant explanatory advantage over rival views that
neglect the historical and dialectical dimension of truth and reason
(O&rsquo;Neill 1989b: 70&ndash;71; Arruda 2016). This requires the
constructivist to provide an account of truth and objective knowledge
as altering in time. O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s defense of the virtuous
circularity of constructivism identifies a solution to a problem that
affects constructivism in general.</p>

<p>
Extending O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s approach, recent forms of Kantian
constructivism emphasize embodiment and social embeddedness rather
than &lsquo;rational agency as such&rsquo;. Some point to the
constitutive role of moral sensibility and practical attitudes in the
account of rational agency (Bagnoli 2013, 2017, forthcoming; Mudd
forthcoming). While this line of inquiry sharpens the distinction
between constructivist and contractualist reasoning (O&rsquo;Neill
2003a, O&rsquo;Neill 2003b), others advances a naturalistic and social
account, according to which agency is an emergent property &ndash;
like those found in biology or economics &ndash; arising from the
complex interactions among agents, and the normativity of a specific
contractualist procedure is sustained (Walden 2012, 2018a, 2018b; cf.
Smith 2020, 2023).</p>

<p>
Finally, Dover and Gingerich (2024) defend a form of constructivism
inspired by Simone de Beauvoir, which bears striking affinities with
Kantian constructivism, but grounds the &lsquo;existential imperative
to will freedom&rsquo; in contingent features of our embodied
subjectivity.</p>

<h2 id="VarHumCon">3. Varieties of Humean Constructivism</h2>

<p>
Humean constructivism builds on the Kantian insight that normative
truths are not simply &ldquo;out there&rdquo;, but denies that they
are deliverances of practical reasoning (Bagnoli 2002: 131; Street
2008a, 2010, 2012; Velleman 2009; Lenman 2010, 2012). The case for
Humean constructivism rests on the alleged inadequacy of competing
views: &ldquo;it is what we are forced to by the untenability of
realism plus the failure of Kantian versions of metaethical
constructivism&rdquo; (Street 2010: 371). Humean constructivists
abandon the claim that moral obligations are requirements of practical
reason. Thus, Humeans maintain that an ideally coherent Caligula who
values maximizing suffering is conceivable. Such a person would have
reasons for torturing people for fun, because the value of humanity is
not a constitutive norm of reasoning (Street 2010: 371; Street 2009,
2012).</p>

<p>
In contrast to Kantian constructivism, Humean constructivists abandon
the claim that moral obligations are requirements of practical
reason.While Korsgaard holds that proper reflection leads everyone to
the same substantive moral principles prescribing particular actions,
Humeans deny that by reflection we can identify any specific moral
content. The constitutive norms of practical reason may favor
morality, but do not require it (Street 2012; Velleman 2009:
150&ndash;154; Lenman 2010: 192). Thus, Humeans maintain that an
ideally coherent Caligula whose aim is to maximize people&rsquo;s
suffering is conceivable. Such a person would have reasons for making
people suffer, which is just to say that the value of humanity is not
a constitutive norm of reasoning (Street 2010: 371; Street 2009, 2012;
Morton 2018; Gill 2025).</p>

<p>
Humean constructivism also rejects the Kantian claim that there are
universal rational norms that bind all rational agents. For instance,
Street argues that &ldquo;the substantive content of a given
agent&rsquo;s reasons is a function of his or her particular,
contingently given, evaluative starting points&rdquo; (Street 2010;
see also Lenman 2010: 180&ndash;181). Consequently, &ldquo;truth and
falsity in the normative domain must always be relativized to a
particular practical point of view&rdquo; (Street 2008a: 224).
Agreement among various practical standpoints is possible but it is
not guaranteed by facts about the nature of reason or the principles
of reason that are authoritative for all rational agents. Humeans hold
that there is nothing alarming about the sort of relativism that their
position implies (Street 2008a: 245). Even though moral norms are not
necessary requirements of reason, there is a sense in which they are
not contingent because they play a large role in our lives.
Furthermore, by analogy with attitudes such as love, which is both
contingent and compelling, Street argues that the fact that moral
commitments are contingent does not weaken their normative force. The
latter claim has been disputed on the ground that the driving force of
love should be distinguished from its normative authority (Bratman
2012).</p>

<p>
Critics argue that Street&rsquo;s Humean constructivism fails to
capture the diachronic complexity of moral reasons (Jaeger 2015;
Guardo 2019), to account for moral improvement and prudential
learning, and to explain the social dimension and key functions of
moral evaluation (LeBar 2023). In cases of conflicting judgments, it
also appears implausibly committed to denying that there is any reason
to choose among the available options (Levy 2019). More broadly,
Street&rsquo;s account of practical reason underestimates the
pervasive role of reasoning and its central function in fostering
agreement and coordination within social life (Bagnoli 2019); this is
a weakness in contrast to many other varieties of constructivism that
have emphasized the coordinating function of morality (Gauthier 1986;
Copp 2005; Brennan, Goodwin and Southwood 2013; O&rsquo;Neill 1989,
2015).</p>

<p>
These objections suggest that Street&rsquo;s individualist,
means&ndash;ends conception of coherence cannot secure diachronic or
interpersonal justification, thereby opening the way for alternative
constructivist strategies that foreground the social and temporal
dimensions of normativity.</p>

<p>
To address this problem, one might expect Humean constructivists to
appeal to artificial virtues or reduce them to social conventions,
thereby aligning with conventionalism &ndash; the view that moral
claims rest on social agreement and are grounded in the actual
practices of groups within particular traditions, a view often
illustrated through the metaphor of construction (Wong 2008).</p>

<p>
If Street&rsquo;s difficulties are to be overcome, however, Humean
constructivism must address, above all, the challenge of securing
objectivity. While constructivism might recognize objective
mind-independent normative truths, these are not mind-independent in
the sense of being available to every agent regardless of whether such
reasons can be derived, logically or instrumentally, from that
agent&rsquo;s evaluative perspective combined with the non-normative
facts. In contrast to Kantian constitutivism, which defends
objectivity in terms of the activity of the will, Street instead
exploits the notion of <em>valuing</em> as a philosophical term
encompassing a wide range of attitudes and experiential states (2016a:
174, 177ff).</p>

<p>
Street (2016b) argues that the objectivity of ethics can be
vindicated, without metaphysical or epistemological mystery, if there
is a universal problem faced by every agent for which morality
provides the universal and best (or only) solution. The particular
solution she explores is an ethics of compassion, which dispenses with
moral concepts such as right, wrong, and obligation (2016b: 166), in
contrast to the forms of moral constructivism discussed in sections
4.1&ndash;4.2. Drawing on the Buddhist tradition, she conceives the
ethical standpoint as &ldquo;the standpoint of pure awareness,&rdquo;
which addresses the problem of attachment and loss: &ldquo;when one
occupies this standpoint, one is identifying with a universal point of
view on the world that transcends any particular, finite point of
view; in doing so, one is identifying with a point of view that is not
itself vulnerable to loss&rdquo; (Street 2016a: 186). This standpoint
is ethical because it is &ldquo;that of pure subject &ndash; the
maximally thin point of view of the &lsquo;one who is
aware&rsquo;&rdquo; (Street 2016a: 187, cf. Street 2016b, Street
2017).</p>

<p>
This move addresses some of the issues noted above, but it faces
difficulties in its impersonal characterization of the ethical
standpoint and its tension with the first-person perspective, on pain
of alienation (cf. Williams 1981, 1985; Nagel 1986; Wallace 2013). A
similar issue arises for Salazar (2021), whose constructivist theory
also draws on Buddhist ethics. She recognizes strong affinities with
Kantian constructivism but proposes a dual source of normativity. This
duality, she argues, rectifies some of the difficulties of
autonomy-based morality by redirecting attention on the suffering of
others, thereby challenging the individualistic conception of the self
as separate and impermeable to others (2021: 175&ndash;176).</p>

<p>
Other strategies to enhance Humean constructivism leads to hybrid
theories because they incorporate elements external to this tradition;
these will be examined in section 4.3. In section 5, we will consider
how these varieties of constructivism relate to antirealism and
expressivism, and in sections 6.2&ndash;6.3 we will discuss the
features of Humean constitutivist strategies.</p>

<h2 id="HybConThe">4. Hybrid Constructivist Theories</h2>

<p>
The debate over the viability of Kantian and Humean constructivism has
given rise to a range of hybrid theories, so called because they
incorporate non-constructivist elements drawn from diverse
philosophical traditions, particularly in their accounts of moral
normativity and moral rationality, thereby shifting the place of
constructivism in the traditional metaethical map. In this section, we
examine forms of constructivism limited to moral principles of right
and wrong but combined with non-constructivist accounts of reasons
(4.1), or grounded in a realist metaphysics (4.2). Section 4.3
considers objectivist developments of Humean constructivism addressing
the quest for objectivity articulated in section 3. Section 4.3. turns
to Aristotelian constructivism, which extends beyond moral
normativity, but rejects Kantian and Humean formalist accounts, and
aligns with a modest variety of normative realism. Section 4.5
discusses Hegelian constructivism, which sharpens some key elements of
O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s developmental conception of practical reason,
but points to actual ontological structures underlying it.</p>

<h3 id="ConAboMorJud">4.1 Constructivism about Moral Judgements</h3>

<p>
Thomas Scanlon defends a restricted constructivist account of
justification for a specific class of moral judgments of right and
wrong (1998: 11&ndash;12, ch. 4, &sect;7.2; 2008; 2014: 94&ndash;98).
Unlike Korsgaard and O&rsquo;Neill, he rejects Kantian constructivism
as a general metaethical view about all normative truths. Moral
questions, he argues, cannot be settled by appealing to the bare
structure of rationality; they require substantive argument (2003b:
14&ndash;15; 2014: 90&ndash;104) &ndash; a point many Kantians would
concede. His aim is to explain the truth of claims about right and
wrong in terms of their being entailed from the standpoint of a
contractual situation.</p>

<p>
The contractualist test holds that an act is wrong if it would be
prohibited by any set of principles that no one could reasonably
reject as a basis for informed, unforced, general agreement. This test
of rejectability specifies the content of moral principles and
explains why it is rational to adopt them. The correctness of
principles depends on a hypothetical agreement among individuals,
defined by their motivations and reasoning. There are no correct moral
principles independently of such agreement: rightness is constituted
by what reasonable agents, under specified conditions, would not
reject (1998: 380 n.48). The test allows for disagreement &ndash; over
standards for assessing conduct or the reasons supporting them &ndash;
without entailing relativism, since not all answers are equally
valid.</p>

<p>
Scanlon objects that constructivist accounts of general normativity
fall prey to bootstrapping: they attempt to justify the normativity of
reasons by procedures that already presuppose it (2014: 96&ndash;104;
Wallace 2012). Unlike Korsgaard or Street, he denies that truths about
reasons are constructed. We reach conclusions about reasons through
normative reasoning (e.g., reflective equilibrium), but such reasoning
requires substantive judgments as inputs; hence, not all facts about
reasons can be constructed (2014: 102&ndash;103). To this extent, he
defends &lsquo;primitivism&rsquo; about reasons (1998: 17, 21; 2013):
reasons are mind-dependent features of the world, existing in virtue
of considerations standing in a &ldquo;favoring relation&rdquo; to
mental states such as intentions. While this is a form of
non-naturalism, it differs sharply from Moorean or robust realism,
which grounds reasons in mind-independent facts (2014: 14; cf. Enoch
2011a: 112&ndash;113; Smith 2023). For Scanlon, truths about reasons
do not require metaphysical guarantees beyond what sound normative
reasoning secures. There is no &ldquo;external&rdquo; question about
their existence, any more than there is about mathematical facts
(2014: 16&ndash;26). In this respect, his view bears affinities with
Carnap&rsquo;s (1956).</p>

<h3 id="SocBasMorCon">4.2 Society-Based Moral Constructivism</h3>

<p>
Society-based constructivism, developed by David Copp, holds that
there are true moral standards produced by a decision procedure that
takes into account the needs and values of a society, together with
facts about its circumstances (Copp 1995, 2007). Moral truth thus
depends on what it would be rational for societies to choose.</p>

<p>
Copp&rsquo;s view shares several features with Kantian constructivism.
First, it maintains that societies require their members to endorse a
suitable moral code in order to sustain cooperation, thereby
conceiving of morality as a cooperative enterprise and grounding the
need for objective moral standards in practical considerations.
Second, it explains moral truth in procedural terms, denying the
existence of moral facts independent of such procedures (Rawls 1980:
307). Third, it insists that any adequate metaethics must account for
the normativity and practical relevance of moral claims (Copp 2007:
4&ndash;7), holding that moral obligations bind us regardless of our
motivational states.</p>

<p>
Unlike Kantian constructivism, however, Copp&rsquo;s account does not
commit to a specific conception of autonomy. Finally, he defends
society-based constructivism as both realist and naturalistic: realist
in treating moral propositions as truth-evaluable and some moral
properties as instantiated, and naturalistic in claiming that these
properties are natural ones (Copp 1995; 2013).</p>

<h3 id="HumMorCon">4.3 Humean Moral Constructivism</h3>

<p>
Recent developments in Humean constructivism have produced hybrid
theories that borrow from different traditions, and whose metaethical
standing diverges significantly, partly in response to the
shortcomings highlighted in section 3 regarding the quest for moral
objectivity.</p>

<p>
First, James Lenman (2012, 2024) develops a hybrid account that
combines constructivism, treated as a first-order account of the
justification of moral reasons, with an expressivist semantics of
ethical judgment. Although Humean in orientation, his view converges
with Kantian constructivism in affirming the unifying role of reason
in agency and in offering a normative procedure embodying ideals of
equality and freedom &ndash; what he calls &ldquo;a form of
expressivism articulated in reason.&rdquo; Unlike Street (2008),
Lenman rejects immoralism, insisting that cases such as torture for
fun must be ruled out not by brute preference but by co-deliberation
within a diachronic community of selves. This requires a modest
principle of agency-unification: to deliberate normatively at all,
agents must integrate their commitments across time, though without
invoking any essentialist conception of the self. On this view,
failures such as Caligula&rsquo;s reflect political collapse rather
than reflective defect.</p>

<p>
For Lenman, constructivism addresses expressivism&rsquo;s central
challenge &ndash; explaining moral objectivity &ndash; but only by
substantive normative means, so it cannot serve as a metaethics on its
own. Expressivism provides the metaethical underpinning, while
constructivism supplies the normative procedure. Together they
vindicate objectivity without metaphysical costs and preserve the
practical significance of moral judgment without reductive naturalism
(2012: 217&ndash;18). In this case, constructivism, ensures the
advantages of Blackburn&rsquo;s quasi-realism (1993): normative
discipline transforms passions into judgments governed by stability,
coherence, and commonality, which, if it succeeds, can be truth-apt
and objective (Lenman 2012: 220; cf. Street 2011). Yet a fundamental
difficulty remains: the nature of desire is either an evaluative
notion or a merely psychological one &ndash; an ambiguity that must be
resolved if Humean constructivism is to advance (Scanlon 1998:
7&ndash;8, ch. 1).</p>

<p>
A second attempt to articulate the quest for objectivity in Humean
terms, proposed by Julia Driver (2017), extends the individual
standpoint through general rules grounded in the practical perspective
of social creatures, thereby accommodating the possibility of moral
failure, self-correction, and practices of social alignment. It
purports to improve over Street&rsquo;s constructivism and Kantian
transcendental arguments by explaining the pressure toward generality
as a natural phenomenon rooted in human sociability. However, the
strategy presupposes an indeterminate account of &ldquo;human
nature&rdquo;, which is problematic (Driver 2017: 176). Second, its
generalizing resources, grounded in sympathy, may fall short of
securing a stable relation between morality and the self (Driver 2017:
180&ndash;81). Third, the key question is whether the Humean appeal to
generality can vindicate its normative significance, particularly in
cases of moral disagreement where the demand for correction requires
justification (Korsgaard 2008: 278&ndash;79). The Humean approach is
thus hard pressed to explain how social animals with capacities such
as sympathy become bound by norms of sympathy, or why they have reason
to endorse the general point of view.</p>

<p>
Finally, Dale Dorsey (2018) proposes &lsquo;perfectionist&rsquo;
constructivism inspired by Hume&rsquo;s esthetics. This view holds
that individual attitudes are constructed out of humanity&rsquo;s
shared evaluative nature. Like its Kantian counterpart, the
perfectionist variety of Humean constructivism holds that some moral
reasons apply universally but denies that obligations are grounded
solely in rationality (Dorsey 2018: 591). The immoralist&rsquo;s error
lies not in incoherence but in being socially dysfunctional and
self-defeating, undermining our shared self-understanding as socially
productive beings. A qualified agreement by those whose sentiments are
&ldquo;in a sound state&rdquo; counts as &ldquo;evidence that human
nature issues a particular verdict in a given case&rdquo; (Dorsey
2018: 585). This formulation is problematic for three reasons: it is
circular in presupposing a common core that should itself be
constructed; it rests on the questionable assumption that actual
practices converge, ignoring both the difficulty of achieving
convergence and the possibility that it may result from irrelevant
factors; and it excludes the prospect of divergent yet equally valid
moralities, which should at least remain conceptually open even if
ultimately rejected on practical grounds. The perfectionist strategy
aligns Humean constructivism more closely with moral realism by
positing a subject matter independent of the agent&rsquo;s
construction.</p>

<p>
Despite these refinements aimed at capturing the social significance
of moral and practical reasoning, it remains doubtful whether these
hybrid views have substantially advanced beyond Street&rsquo;s
position.</p>

<h3 id="AriEthCon">4.4 Aristotelian Ethical Constructivism</h3>

<p>
Aristotelian constructivism holds that our true normative judgments
represent a normative reality, but this reality is not independent of
the exercise of moral and practical judgment (LeBar 2008: 182;
2013a,b). Like the Kantian varieties of constructivism, Aristotelian
constructivism appeals to constitutive features of practical
reason:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
practical truth is constructed, not discovered, because it is activity
in accordance with the norms of practical rationality, which are
themselves constitutive of agency. (LeBar 2008: 191)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike Kantian models, however, it rejects formal and procedural
principles in favor of a substantive account of the good life, rooted
in eudaimonism. Rational agents set the standard of practical
rationality through the exercise of intellectual and moral virtues
(Aristotle, <em>NE</em> II.6; cf. Berryman 2019). The negative case
for Aristotelian constructivism targets the Kantian view of practical
reasoning as law-like, governed by universality. Critics argue that
Kantians struggle to apply universal principles to concrete cases
(H&ouml;ffe 1993; LeBar 2013b; Millgram 2005: ch. 6). Aristotelians
claim an advantage here: their account allows practical reasoning to
adapt to particulars and offers a framework for norms of successful
judgment, an area where Kantian ethics is seen as deficient (Millgram
2005: ch. 6). Kantian ethics is often criticized for either rigorism
or empty formalism, and though constructivists such as O&rsquo;Neill
(1975) and Herman (1993) attempt to address the role of circumstances,
Aristotelians contend these efforts remain inadequate (LeBar
2013b).</p>

<p>
To identify the substantive standards of practical reasoning,
Aristotelian constructivism starts with a study of the complexity of
our rational animal nature, which excludes that the principles
constitutive of human rationality can be merely formal. In contrast to
Kantian self-legislation, Aristotelian constructivism emphasizes the
interplay between rational and animal nature, focusing especially on
training and shaping the affective and sensitive aspects of our
nature. In particular, it emphasizes the transformative effects of
reflection on passions and desires, and the possibility of developing
a &lsquo;second nature&rsquo;, thanks to complex processes such as
habituation and education (LeBar 2008: 197). Practical rationality
does not merely direct affective responses toward adequate objects but
also structurally transforms our animal sensibility into character.
Aristotelian constructivism rests on two central concepts: the good
life (<em>eudaimonia</em>) and practical wisdom (<em>phronesis</em>),
whose contents are progressively defined through their mutual
interaction (LeBar 2023: 479). While general standards exist, in
particular cases it is <em>phronesis</em> that determines them. There
are no independent facts that establish what a good life is apart from
the judgment of the wise. Such judgments are substantive rather than
formal, and particular rather than universal.</p>

<h3 id="HegEthCon">4.5 Hegelian Ethical Constructivism</h3>

<p>
Hegel-inspired ethical constructivism affirms the primacy of social
processes over individual agency, though they diverge on how to
conceive this priority, producing different positions toward realism.
Some interpret Hegel as claiming that moral normativity is
&ldquo;invented&rdquo; (Pippin 2008), while others insist that human
nature is always already shaped by ethical order (Laitinen 2020;
Thompson 2020). To stress antirelativist commitments, one strand
retains a qualified normative realism, weakened or historically
mediated (Rockmore 2016; Werner 2017; Gladhill &amp; Stein 2020;
Ostritsch 2020; Laitinen 2016, 2020). Others treat the social nature
of constructions as neutral but objectivist (Westphal2003, 2016,
2017), while some, following Korsgaard, argue that constructivism
destabilizes the realism/skepticism dichotomy (Wretzler 2020).</p>

<p>
In stark contrast to formalist and transcendent aspirations,
Neo-Hegelians emphasize actuality: reason unfolds through concrete
forms while leaving space for alternative or thwarted paths (Ng 2009;
Moyland 2011; Yeomans 2012; Redding 2020). This yields a robust
account of practical reason that affirms its historicity and embeds
autonomy in complex social processes (<em>Bildung</em>). On this view,
the constraints of practical cognition are socially grounded, arising
from the norms of a community of rational agents at a given historical
moment. Rational agency is thus not reducible to self-relation but
requires recognition and engagement with others. Autonomy cannot be
simply assumed but must be situated within a sociopolitical reality,
prompting inquiry into its ontological constitution.
Self-determination and choice become possible only within such
contexts, and the authority of reasons varies across social
formations. Constructivism thus becomes a theory of social agency,
foregrounding autonomy as lived within institutions.</p>

<p>
The Hegelian notion of &lsquo;sublation&rsquo; (<em>Aufhebung</em>)
designates a process of preservation and transformation. It implies
that social constructions, though indispensable for rational agency,
are not ultimate normative standards but concrete frameworks within
which reasoning unfolds, shaping practical truth through structural,
epistemic, and contextual functions. Ethical life thus preserves past
commitments that continue to shape collective and individual
identities.</p>

<p>
A strength of this model is its fallibilism: norms may obscure
objective contents, yet practices remain open to critique and
correction. Here moral sensibility &ndash; especially the experience
of suffering &ndash; plays an epistemic role in detecting injustice
and empowering ethical and political contestation (Ostritsch 2020;
Laitinen 2020). By focusing on concrete formations, this variety of
constructivism highlights how agents discern the limits of their
historical realities, illuminating responsibility, social roles, and
historically conditioned alienation missed by individualist accounts
of reflective endorsement.</p>

<p>
The view that ethical norms are social artifacts leans toward
antirealism but struggles to vindicate their truth-claims. Purely
social constructivism, lacking ontological grounding, faces two
objections: relativism, since reasons bound to sociohistorical
contexts risk losing critical force, and reification, since reasons
embedded in practices may appear immune to scrutiny (Thompson 2020).
Hegelian approaches reply by positing a social ontology: human beings
are essentially social, and their relations constitute reality itself,
historically reshaped in diverse forms (Redding 2020; Thompson 2020).
On this account, objectivity is internal to concrete social formations
rather than the contingent product of convention. Its strength lies in
avoiding relativism while grounding normativity socially; its weakness
is reliance on agents to apprehend reasons expressive of the systemic
totality of their social world. Whether this confidence is justified,
and how it avoids reification, remains an open question.</p>

<h2 id="ConPlaMet">5. Constructivism&rsquo;s Place in Metaethics</h2>

<p>
Constructivism has become a central position in both practical
philosophy and metaethics, appealing for its attempt to secure moral
objectivity while avoiding the epistemological and ontological burdens
of nonnaturalist realism (Darwall, Gibbard, &amp; Railton 1992;
Shafer-Landau 2003, ch. 4). Yet this aim is not unique to
constructivism: naturalist realism also promises objectivity without
nonnaturalist commitments, and antirealist theories likewise defend
objectivity on non-ontological grounds (Hare 1952; Gibbard 1990;
Wright 1992). What distinguishes constructivism is its potential to
reconcile the key features of normative truths &ndash; their
objectivity, their intelligibility, and their practical authority
(Scanlon 2014: 91).</p>

<h3 id="ConAppNorDis">5.1 The Constructivist Approach to Normative Discourse</h3>

<p>
Thus far, constructivists have not developed a distinctive account of
the meaning or logical behavior of moral and normative terms. In the
absence of a constructivist semantics, some suggest that
constructivism is best seen as &ldquo;a family of substantive moral
theories&rdquo; (Darwall et al. 1992: 140; Hussain &amp; Shah 2006,
2013; Enoch 2009; Hussain 2012). On this view, constructivism is not a
metaethical theory, since by treating normative concepts as solutions
to practical problems it remains within the normative domain (Ridge
2012). This objection, however, assumes a sharp boundary between
normative ethics and metaethics. Constructivists reject this, aiming
instead to clarify the reasons that make moral principles ones no one
could reasonably reject (Scanlon 1998: 246&ndash;247; 2003a:
429&ndash;435). The dispute thus turns on what counts as metaethics.
Some constructivists even regard the semantic focus of traditional
metaethics as misguided, diverting attention from the real issue
&ndash; the nature of normativity itself (Korsgaard 1996a; 2003: 122
fn.49; Street 2008a: 239), and hence call for a break with the
&ldquo;platitudes&rdquo; of metaethics (Korsgaard 2003: 105).</p>

<p>
Still, some constructivists pursue also a semantic task from within a
broader understanding of metaethics. Some argue that identifying the
constitutive norms of valuing provides the basis for an inferentialist
semantics, whereby normative terms are explained through the kinds of
inferences &ndash; such as those about means and ends &ndash; required
to count as employing them at all (Street 2010: 239&ndash;242). This
commits constructivists to showing that their proposal improves on
rival accounts (cf. Jaeger 2015). Others articulate a pragmatist
variety of constructivism about normative discourse (Richardson 1994,
1995, 1998, 2008, 2013, 2018; Elgyin 1997; Misak 2000; Schwartz 2017).
M&uuml;ller (2020) defends a theory of reasoning as requiring reason
judgments, where reason judgments are not representational yet still
truth apt, analysing the nature of these judgments in functionalist
terms as guiding reasoning in a certain way (cf. Frug&eacute; 2021;
Silverstein 2022).</p>

<h3 id="ConAccTru">5.2 Constructivist Accounts of Truth</h3>

<p>
Constructivists must deny the correspondence theory of truth, the view
that truth is correspondence to a fact. At the same time, they can
allow that normative judgments are truth-apt. This view is hospitable
to the constructivist claim that moral and normative truths may alter
over time, as a result of ongoing rational deliberation and revision
(Richardson 2013; LeBar 2013b; O&rsquo;Neill 1992, 2015; Laitinen
2016). Some attempts to deal with semantic issues bring to light a
resemblance between constructivism and pragmatism, which rejects the
idea that truth is correspondence to a mind-independent world,
stressing instead that truth is tied to inquiry responsive to argument
and evidence: it is the state of belief that, after full inquiry,
would not be improved or defeated, although we me not know when we
have reached such a belief. Human inquiry is fallible and provisional,
but truth is tied to the ideal of inquiry&rsquo;s completion (Misak
2000, cf. Richardson 1998). Like pragmatism, constructivism appeals to
the practical point of view to account for truth, in contrast to
standard forms of realism about truth (Proulx 2016; Elgin 1997;
Richardson 2013; Schwartz 2017). Some critics are skeptical about the
possibility of developing a constructivist account of truth (Hussain
2012: 189ff; Dorsey 2012). Schwartz and Velasco (2019) develop a
semantic account of metanormative constructivism, where moral claims
are true if endorsed by idealized agents through practical reasoning.
Their framework clarifies how constructivism can treat moral judgments
as truth-apt and normatively authoritative without appealing to
independent moral facts.</p>

<h3 id="ConReaAntDeb">5.3 Constructivism and the Realism-Antirealism Debate</h3>

<p>
The varieties of constructivism occupy different positions in the
realism&ndash;antirealism debate. Kantian constructivism has been cast
as a third option between realism and subjectivism (Rawls 1980), or
between realism and relativism (O&rsquo;Neill 1989a; Korsgaard 1996a:
36). Some interpret constructivism as realist (Copp 2013; LeBar 2013,
2023), others as antirealist (Lenman 2010, 2024), while still others
defend hybrid views, such as &ldquo;prioritism,&rdquo; which combines
realism about reasons with constructivism about moral judgments
(Scanlon 1998, 2014, 2003b: 18). Street (2006, 2008a, 2009, 2012)
places constructivism on the antirealist side, even embracing a form
of relativism. This diversity suggests it is a mistake to assess
constructivism&rsquo;s significance solely in terms of the
realism&ndash;antirealism debate (Korsgaard 2008: 312, 325 n.49; Copp
2013; Engstrom 2013: 138ff).</p>

<p>
Part of the difficulty lies in divergent definitions of realism
(Sayre-McCord 2015; Joyce 2015; Miller 2014; LeBar 2023; Smith 2018).
Realists generally hold that (a) moral discourse is cognitivist, (b)
there are moral properties such as rightness, (c) some moral
properties are instantiated, and (d) moral predicates express
properties. Disagreement arises over whether realism requires the
stronger claim that (e) moral properties are mind-independent. Further
divisions concern naturalism, which holds that (f) moral properties
are metaphysically on a par with non-moral properties and (g) moral
assertions express ordinary beliefs about their instantiation.
Constructivists generally accept (nonreductive) naturalism but some
reject (e): they hold that normative properties depend on human
sensibility or rational agency rather than being mind-independent.
Like realist naturalism and antirealism, constructivism is committed
to metaphysical parsimony, distinguishing it from Moorean and robust
moral realism (Enoch 2011a).</p>

<p>
Korsgaard highlights a shared assumption of both realism and
antirealism, which constructivists reject: that the function of
concepts in truth-apt judgments is representational, such that
normative truths must refer to something &ldquo;out there.&rdquo;
Constructivists instead claim that normative concepts serve a
practical function: they articulate solutions to practical problems
rather than represent moral facts (Korsgaard 2008: 302ff). Thus,
equity, for example, does not name a property but proposes a way of
distributing goods. Constructivism therefore differs from substantive
realism, which grounds truth in a mind-independent normative reality,
and from antirealism, which denies normative truth altogether:
practical judgments can be true or false without representing
independent normative facts (Korsgaard 2003: 325 n.49).</p>

<p>
This characterization, however, does not neatly capture
constructivism&rsquo;s place. First, Korsgaard equates realism with
mind-independence, but many define it more broadly to include views
where normative truths depend on mental states (Sayre-McCord 1988;
Copp 2007: 7; LeBar 2023). Second, some antirealists allow that moral
judgments are truth-apt but treat truth as a deflationary semantic
notion (Ridge 2012; Lenman &amp; Shemmer 2012b). Constructivism thus
marks a middle ground between forms of realism committed to
mind-independent truths and forms of antirealism that deny normative
truth altogether. In this sense, it resembles &ldquo;sophisticated
subjectivism&rdquo; (Wiggins 1993; McDowell 1985), though Kantian
constructivism grounds normative truth in rational agency rather than
sensibility.</p>

<p>
Some forms of Humean constructivism align closely with expressivism,
which treats normative language as guiding action rather than
representing facts (Chrisman 2010; Meyers 2012; Ridge 2012; Tiberius
2012). Lenman (2012) argues that this link helps constructivism
address the problem of identifying the mental states expressed by
normative judgments. Yet many constructivists deny that expressivism
can capture the authority of normativity, reducing moral discourse to
mere &ldquo;emotional expletives&rdquo; (Korsgaard 2003: 105) or to
normative states (Street 2010: 239&ndash;242; Korsgaard 2003, 2008,
2009; LeBar 2023). For Korsgaard in particular, the problem of
normative authority must be addressed from the first-person
perspective, something both realism and expressivism fail to achieve
(1996a; 2008: 30&ndash;31, 55&ndash;57, 67&ndash;68, 234). Other
constructivists doubt that expressivism can capture the social
dimension of moral evaluation (LeBar 2023: 472, 479), and endorse a
modest variety of realism. Some hybrid theories endorse explicitly
moral (Copp 1995) or normative realism (Rockmore 2016; Werner 2017;
Gladhill &amp; Stein 2020; Ostritsch 2020; Laitinen 2016, 2020) or
align to it (Driver 2017; Dorsey 2018), while others combine
constructivism with expressivism (Lenman 2012), or reject the
realism/antirealist dichotomy (Westphal2003, 2016, 2017, Wretzler
2020).</p>

<h2 id="EutQue">6. The <em>Euthyphro</em> Question</h2>

<p>
Constructivism explains practical truths through the constitutive
activity of reasoning captured by the notion of
&ldquo;construction.&rdquo; It provides &ldquo;a potentially
devastating argument against realism&rdquo; (Shafer-Landau 2003: 49),
showing an explanatory power that realism lacks (Shafer-Landau 2003:
51). But all these comparative advantages are nulled by an
Euthyphro-style dilemma: if reasoning is unconstrained, its results
are arbitrary; if constrained, the constraints are not constructed and
entail realism (Shafer-Landau 2003: 42). Thus, constructivism appears
either arbitrary or collapses into realism.</p>

<p>
This objection can be formulated and motivated in at least two ways,
which will be examined in sections 6.1&ndash;6.2, while section 6.3
will discuss the viability of constitutivism as an account of moral
normativity.</p>

<h3 id="RolInt">6.1 The Role of Intuitions</h3>

<p>
The first objection is that constructivism relies on an
&ldquo;unconstructed,&rdquo; and thus unjustified, set of normative
constraints. Kantian constructivism, for example, seems grounded in
the value of moral impartiality, which demands equal respect for
persons (Scanlon 1998: 22&ndash;33, 287&ndash;290; Rawls 1993:
38&ndash;54). The worry is that constructivism risks vacuity, since
&ldquo;its test yields results only by presupposing moral views which
can only be established independently of it&rdquo; (Raz 2003: 358;
Hare 1983; Brink 1987, 1989; Timmons 2003; Cohen 2003). Moreover, as
Timmons argues, there is &ldquo;no non-question-begging feature to
which the constructivist can help herself in breaking symmetry among
the various competing sets of constructed principles&rdquo; (2003:
&sect;3).</p>

<p>
Kant is keenly aware of the air of paradox surrounding the claim that
the moral concepts, such as good and evil, are not determined prior to
engaging in practical reasoning, but only as a result of engaging in
practical reasoning. This is known as the &lsquo;paradox of the
method&rsquo; (Kant C2, 5: 62 ff.). As Rawls explains it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The difficulty is that Kant appears to know in advance of critical
reflection how a constructivist doctrine might look, but this makes it
impossible to undertake such reflection in good faith. In reply to
this quite proper worry, we interpret constructivism as a view about
how the structure and content of the soundest moral doctrine would
look once it is laid out after due critical reflection. (Rawls 2000:
274)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Practical reasoning, then, is not a matter of discovering values
independent of its verdicts. For Kantian constructivists, it yields a
form of self-conscious practical knowledge, intelligible only through
accounts that treat cognition as self-conscious activity (Rawls 2000:
148, 218; Engstrom 2013; Bagnoli 2013b; Jezzi 2016 [Other Internet
Resources]). Its novelty lies in explaining objective moral knowledge
without presupposing an independent moral reality, but instead
grounding it in reason&rsquo;s own activity.</p>

<p>
Debate persists about the role of intuitions in justification. For
Scanlon (1998), appeal to intuitions is unavoidable: justification
proceeds by testing the fit between theoretical assumptions and
intuitive moral judgments, which serve as initial data without
constituting independent truths. Others, such as O&rsquo;Neill
(1989b), deny intuitions any justificatory role. Still, most
constructivists agree that metaethics must remain broadly congruent
with common understandings of rationality and morality (Smith 2013).
In this respect, constructivism distinguishes itself from projectivist
or error theories (Blackburn 1993; Mackie 1977), which regard
evaluative discourse as systematically mistaken (Bagnoli 2002; Street
2011; Lillehammer 2011).</p>

<h3 id="StaConNor">6.2 The Status of Constitutivist Norms</h3>

<p>
A second formulation of the objection that constructivism avoids
arbitrariness by tacitly relying on unconstructed elements targets the
constitutivist strategy. How are constitutive norms justified? The
objection holds that they are either arbitrary or realist, depending
on normative features of reality that are unconstructed (Fitzpatrick
2013; Stern 2013; Baiasu 2016; Bratu &amp; Dittmeyer 2016; cf. Bachman
2018).</p>

<p>
In providing an account of rational justification, both realists and
constructivists rely on unconstructed elements. Normative or
non-naturalist realists take normativity as primitive: certain facts
simply are reasons, and &ldquo;there won&rsquo;t be any illuminating
explanation&rdquo; of what makes this true (Shafer-Landau 2003:
47&ndash;48). Reductive naturalists, by contrast, identify normative
facts with natural facts, accessible through empirical methods &ndash;
for instance, facts about agents&rsquo; responses under idealized
conditions (Smith 2012, 2013).</p>

<p>
Constructivism, while compatible with non-reductive naturalism
(Korsgaard 1996; Walden 2012), does not reduce moral properties to
natural ones but seeks to explain the standards of practical reason
(O&rsquo;Neill 1989b; Korsgaard 2003, 2009; Street 2010; Velleman
2009). Unlike (naturalist and normative) realism, however,
constructivism an <em>external</em> foundation of normative standards.
Internality is construed in two ways. According to Korsgaard,</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Constitutive standards are opposed to external standards, which
mention desiderata for an object that are not essential to its being
the kind of thing that it is&rdquo; (Korsgaard 2008: 8).</p>

<p>
A more modest interpretation insists on the role of internal standards
in practical reasoning, which is &ldquo;avowedly circular&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the standards of practical reasoning are fundamental to all human
reasoning, then any vindication of these standards is either circular
(since it uses those very standards) or a failure (since it is not a
vindication in terms of the standards that are said to be
fundamental). (O&rsquo;Neill 1989b: 29)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The latter interpretation stands in contrast to the traditional
&ldquo;first principles philosophy&rdquo;, which derives moral truths
from principles that have the status of axioms (cf. Schneewind 1970).
The shared constructivist conviction is that appeal to standards
constitutive of agency explains with ease why such standards are
normative (Korsgaard 2008: 8). They are normative because in the very
activity of reasoning we are committing ourselves to being guided by
them. In forming our intentions and beliefs, we are answerable to
criteria of correctness that are internal to and constitutive of the
very exercise of rationality (Korsgaard 2008: 13&ndash;15,
110&ndash;126, 207&ndash;229).</p>

<p>
The place of constitutivism &ndash; and correspondingly of
constitutivist constructivism &ndash; within the traditional
metaethical landscape remains contested. Some regard constitutivism as
broadly realist, on the grounds that moral judgments express beliefs
that can be true, though not in the robust realist sense (Smith 2013,
2018, 2020, 2023). Others interpret it as compatible with expressivism
(Silverstein 2016; Ridge 2018). Varieties of Humean and Aristotelian
constitutivism or constructivism are often mind-dependent (Street
2010, cf. 2016b; LeBar 2023), while others are mind-independent,
appealing either to natural objects (Smith 2023) or to practical laws
(O&rsquo;Neill 1989; LeBar 2023: 471). Some versions are idealized
(Smith 2013, 2020, 2023; Street 2016a), while others are non-idealized
(O&rsquo;Neill 1987, 1989; Walden 2018a, 2018b; Bagnoli forthcoming).
Appeals to idealized rationality are often charged with circularity,
since they offer no independent, non&ndash;question-begging reason for
those very standards. For some, idealization is a normative matter;
for others, it concerns facts about the psychology of idealized
agents, which are themselves conceived as natural objects (Smith
2023). Further disagreement arises over the definition of idealized
agency: for some, it includes features such as self-control and
resistance to intra- and interpersonal conflict (Smith 2023: 101; cf.
Lindeman 2019, Coleman 2023), while for others it involves the
dissolution of the self (Salazar 2021; cf. Street 2016a). All forms of
constitutivism are at least compatible with non-reductive naturalism,
though some take a reductive naturalist form, and others may even
commit to essentialism. Some constitutivist accounts support moral
objectivity &ndash; either in a robust form that coheres with
first-person deliberation (O&rsquo;Neill 1989; Korsgaard 2009;
O&rsquo;Hagan 2014) or in an absolutist form (Smith 2023) &ndash;
while others are relativistic (Street 2008, 2010). Certain versions
adopt a moral rationalist framework, according to which moral
requirements entail corresponding reasons for action, are knowable
<em>a priori</em>, and are grounded in practical reason. For some,
however, this capacity is reduced to facts about the psychology of
ideal agents (Smith 2023: 103&ndash;104). In the next section, we will
limit the discussion to the constitutivist strategies relevant to
constructivism because constitutivism can be defended as a theory
independent of (meta-ethical and moral) constructivism, as the general
view that the view that we can justify fundamental normative claims by
showing that agents become committed to these claims merely in virtue
of acting (see Katsafanas 2019; cf. Ferrero 2021).</p>

<h3 id="ConAboMorNor">6.3 Constitutivism about Moral Normativity</h3>

<p>
The constructivist use of constitutivist strategies in defending moral
normativity offers at least three advantages. First, it sidesteps the
internalist/externalist distinction by directly linking rationality
with agency. Second, it resolves the problem of authority by
dispensing with the need for external facts to legitimate claims of
normative force. Third, it vindicates <em>a priori</em> moral and
practical knowledge &ndash; providing rational justification for moral
verdicts &ndash; while remaining consistent with a minimalist or
constructivist metaphysics of the moral domain (Walden 2018;
Katsafanas 2018; Schroeter, Jones, &amp; Schroeter 2018: 8; Ferrero
2021).</p>

<p>
An outstanding question is whether the constitutivist strategy
suffices to account for moral obligation. Constructivists are devided
about this claim. Korsgaard (2009) holds that the principles governing
action are &ldquo;constitutive standards&rdquo; of agency, that is,
standards arising from the nature of agency itself, which explain the
normativity of moral obligations. The marks of agency are autonomy and
efficacy, and the categorical and hypothetical imperatives are norms
grounded on these two properties. These norms are
&ldquo;constitutive&rdquo; of rational agency in that (i) they
determine what a rational agent is (the &ldquo;constitution
requirement&rdquo;), and (ii) they empower an agent to realize her
identity as the particular person she is, by guiding her conduct
according to those standards (the &ldquo;self-constitution
requirement&rdquo;). According to Korsgaard (2019), Kantian
constructivism is uniquely positioned to vindicate the self-
constitution requirement while Humean and Aristotelian theories fail
to meet it. Yet the Kantian claims about the rational authority of
morality are found puzzling (Brink 1992).</p>

<p>
Humean Constitutivism is more modest (Street 2006), in that is
acknowledges only the principle of logical consistency. The
differences among these two constitutivist strategies can be
illustrated by comparing their respective diagnoses of the immoralist
(Street 2010: 371; cf. Street 2016a). Humean constructivists admits
ideally coherent eccentrics, like Caligula who &ldquo;aims solely to
maximize the suffering of others&rdquo;; for such agents, there are
reasons for torturing others (Street 2009). Kantian constructivists
deny that there might be reasons for maximizing the suffering of
others but provide different arguments in support of this claim. Some
argue that Caligula&rsquo;s incoherence can be shown by spelling out
the norms that are constitutive of valuing. Such constitutive norms
entail valuing humanity, and this proves that Caligula is mistaken by
his own lights, even though he may never fully realize this, due to
poor reflection, ignorance of the non-normative facts or some other
limitation (Korsgaard 1996a: 121&ndash;123; cf. Street 2016a). A
different Kantian argument establishes that an internally coherent
Caligula is conceivable, that is, he can be thought without
contradiction, but his case is blocked by general facts about moral
sensibility and interdependency, and coordination requirements
(Engstrom 2009: 243). Ultimately, there are no reasons to inflict
maximal suffering. Crucially, unlike in realism, this conclusion does
not depend on the existence of moral truths that precede or stand
independent of practical reasoning (Street 2016a).</p>

<p>
By itself, consistency is too thin to account for the kind of
constraints that rational agents need to impose on the dynamic process
of goal management (Gibbard 1999; Smith 1999). To account for these
normative constraints, some add a broad principle of coherence, which
demands a unified account of the agent&rsquo;s goals, and thus goes
beyond strict logical consistency (Shemmer 2012; Lenman 2012). Others
argue for additional but related principles, which regulate attention
and disregard (James 2007, 2012), benevolence and non-interference
(Smith 2013: 322, 328). For Kantians, however, that the normativity of
instrumental principles of rationality rests on the normativity of
non-instrumental principles (O&rsquo;Neill 1989b: 73&ndash;74;
Korsgaard 1997, 2008: esp. 67&ndash;69), expressing respect for others
as having equal standing (Bagnoli 2013b).</p>

<p>
Disagreement persists over the scope and role of constitutivism in
Kantian ethics (Bagnoli and Bacin forthcoming). Some view it as a
response to skepticism about practical reason (O&rsquo;Neill 1989;
Korsgaard 1983, 2019; Engstrom 2009; Bagnoli 2013a), while others
argue it misfits Kant&rsquo;s project (Gobsch 2019; Saemi 2016;
Tenenbaum 2016). Critics contend that the categorical imperative, as a
constitutive standard, is too thin to yield determinate moral
obligations (Nozick 1981: 545&ndash;551; Cohen 1996; Bratman 1998;
Gibbard 1999: 149, 152&ndash;153; Fitzpatrick 2005; Scanlon 2007). In
fact, most Kantians deny that moral obligations can be derived from
universal features of bare rationality alone, and also deny that
appeal to constitutive norms of rationality is sufficient to provide a
complete system of moral duties (O&rsquo;Neill 1989; Sensen 2013,
2017; Timmons 2017; Bagnoli 2021).</p>

<p>
Constitutivism faces serious challenges that threaten to undermine the
constructivist project in all its forms. The first concerns the status
of constitutive standards. These standards are meant to be both
normative and, at least in part, descriptive of the very activity they
govern (Korsgaard 2008: 9). Critics argue, however, that it is unclear
whether &ndash; and how &ndash; such standards can be violated (Cohen
1996: 177). For an agent to count as subject to norms, she must also
be capable of violating them. Suppose, for instance, that there is a
norm prohibiting deception: to say that a rational agent is guided by
this norm is to say that she can fail to comply with it. Yet if the
norm is constitutive of reasoning itself, how could it be broken in
the very act of reasoning? If constitutive norms are in principle
inviolable, then constitutivism seems to entail that both immoralism
and irrationality are impossible (Lavin 2004; cf. Cokelet 2008).</p>

<p>
A related objection concerns the very possibility of bad action
(Katsafanas 2018). Korsgaard responds that in order to count as acting
at all, we must at least be attempting to follow the principles of
practical reason, though we may fail to do so adequately or fully
(Korsgaard 2009: 45&ndash;49, 159&ndash;176; Pauer-Studer 2018). For
example, one may adopt the moral end of benevolence yet pursue it
without grace or understanding, thereby provoking resentment rather
than eliciting gratitude. Thus, a mistaken judgment about what
self-defense requires mischaracterizes the very nature of
self-defense. The issue is whether such defective approximations
constitute transgressions of normative requirements, rather than mere
failures of what is expected of agents. Addressing this requires a
more radical strategy: a constitutivist metaphysics of capacities that
explains error as an imperfection of action (Fix 2020) and charts
different modes of alienation from constitutive norms (Tenenbaum
2019). Herman suggests that in defective instances of action,
constitutive norms are not misapplied but misrepresented (Herman 2007:
171&ndash;172, 245&ndash;246).</p>

<p>
A second objection is that the constitutivist strategy depends on the
claim that agency is inescapable, whereas critics argue that agency is
no less optional than any other activity (Enoch 2006; Tiffany 2012;
Leffler 2016, 2019, 2024a,b). Constitutivists cannot simply appeal to
the constitutive role of agency to explain why its rules bind, for
inescapability by itself provides no normative force (Kolodny 2005).
On this view, the authority of rational requirements is illusory: they
merely track antecedent reasons rather than generate new ones.
Constitutivists reply that the objector overlooks the inescapability
of agency itself. While it is possible to disengage from any
particular activity, some form of agency always remains operative
(Ferrero 2010a; Velleman 2009: 138&ndash;141; James 2012). In this
sense, agency is not optional. Enoch counters that even if some form
of activity is always present, this does not entail that the norms
constituting such activity yield normative reasons for any particular
agent (Enoch 2011b). The constitutivist rejoinder is that the very
question of whether there are reasons to be agents can only arise
within agency itself (Velleman 2009: 204&ndash;206). One does not need
a reason to be an agent rather than not, and thus Enoch&rsquo;s
challenge is not a genuine or live question (Rosati 2016: 201 n.71;
Silverstein 2015: 1136&ndash;1138). For Ferrero (2019) the appeal to
inescapability works best as a defensive move but fails to sustain
robust moral normativity.</p>

<p>
These replies are effective at least against some versions of the
shmagency objection (Arruda 2017; Paakkunainen 2018). Whether agents
have conclusive reasons to be agents, however, might depend on the
particular version of constitutivism. For most constitutivists, this
involves grounding authoritative norms in the teleological structure
of agency (Korsgaard 2009; Engstrom 2009). For others, the
constitutivist project can be salvaged only if it is supplemented with
a reductive metanormative account of reasons for action, which links
reasons to sound or successful practical reasoning (Silverstein
2016).</p>

<p>
A third objection is that treating moral obligations as rational
requirements does not resolve the question of their normative
authority (Broome 2005; Kolodny 2005), unless such requirements are
shown to be either intrinsically normative or valuable independently
of their contingent benefits. Meeting this challenge thus depends on
vindicating the intrinsically normative character of rationality
itself (Williams 1981, 1985, 1994). This debate is rooted in a
fundamental disagreement about the scope and powers of practical
reason.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Finally, other worries arise from Bratman (2012)&rsquo;s charge that
constructivism overconstrains deliberation, producing tension between
reflective and prereflective judgments, especially when loyalties or
attachments conflict with impartial duties. This is a problem even
when for the modest Humean constitutivism that recognizes only a
formal requirement of consistency. If the input judgments include
attitudes such as love and caring, which are not necessarily
responsive to intersubjective pressures, agents may end up endorsing
reflective judgments that are not aligned with their unreflective
judgments. This may be taken as a variety of alienation (Tenenbaum
2019, Mudd forthcoming, Sensen forthcoming).</p>

<p>
This debate indicates the importance of the temporal dimensions of
rational agency (James 2012; Ferrero 2009, 2010b; Smith 2013: 315ff).
Recent varieties of constructivism take into account the predicaments
of contingency (Street 2012), the possibility normative revisions
(Baldwin 2013, Richardson 2018), moral progress (Arruda 2016), and
concrete forms of normativity (Gledhill and Stein 2020, cf. Bagnoli
2022, &sect;4). It is noteworthy that the growing attention to the
temporal dimension of rational agency has been paralleled by an
increased focus on the social dimension of moral evaluation. Early
Humean and Kantian accounts &ndash; especially Street (2006, 2008,
2010) and Korsgaard (1996) &ndash; have often been criticized for
offering an overly self-centered conception of morality that fails to
take its interpersonal character seriously (Cohen 1996; Williams 1996;
Meyr 2019). More recent approaches address this shortcoming by
emphasizing the social dimension of moral life (Walden 2012, 2018a;
cf. Smith 2020, 2023). The foregoing discussion highlights reflective
equilibrium as a method of moral justification aimed at achieving
coherence among our considered moral judgments, moral principles, and
background theories. The method is iterative: when conflicts arise,
either principles or judgments are revised until a state of mutual
support is achieved. Although originally developed by Rawls, this
methodological tool has been adopted by constitutivists as diverse as
Smith (2010: 134, 136&ndash;137, 2013, 2020, 2023) and LeBar (2023),
as well as by others (Baldwin 2013; Werner 2017; Walden 2018).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="ConRem">7. Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>
In response to the debates surveyed in sections 5&ndash;6, recent
constructivist theories have increasingly embraced hybrid elements,
e.g., treating constitutivism not as a comprehensive theory but as a
partial account of moral normativity.</p>

<p>
New varieties of metaethical constructivism are emerging that draw on
the insights of philosophers such as Spinoza (Zuck 2015), Adam Smith
(Stueber 2016), Nietzsche (Katsafanas 2013; Silk 2015), Murdoch
(Mylonaki 2018, Mylonaki forthcoming), or Habermas (Rees 2020). Not
all explicitly situate themselves within metaethics, independently of
realism and antirealism, yet they converge in treating the notion of
construction as a distinctive explanatory tool for accounting for the
objectivity and normativity of ethical truths.</p>

<p>
Over the past three decades, constructivism has established itself as
a distinctive and influential position within metaethics. Like other
leading theories, it faces serious objections; yet its capacity to
reframe questions about normativity, objectivity, and practical reason
marks it as a significant and enduring contribution to contemporary
metaethical inquiry.</p>
