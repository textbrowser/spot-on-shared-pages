<dd>Julie chose <em>b</em> over <em>a</em>, even though she knew
<em>b</em> was more expensive than <em>a</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There is nothing puzzling about Julie&rsquo;s choice. Perhaps Julie
was choosing among vacation options, and <em>b</em> was a week&rsquo;s
vacation in Paris, while <em>a</em> was a week&rsquo;s vacation in
Peoria. In any event, Julie evidently took the overall merits of
<em>b</em> to outweigh those of <em>a</em>, even if <em>b</em> was
inferior from a financial standpoint.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>Jimmy opted for <em>d</em> over <em>c</em>, despite his judging
<em>c</em> to be a healthier choice than <em>d</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Again, we find Jimmy&rsquo;s decision unremarkable. Perhaps <em>c</em>
and <em>d</em> were competing dessert options: <em>c</em>, let us
suppose, was a dish of dry Wheaties, rich in fiber and whole grain,
whereas <em>d</em> was a gossamer-light yet oh-so-rich Valrhona
chocolate mousse. Jimmy obviously (and reasonably!) assessed
<em>d</em> as the better dessert option all things considered, even
though he knew <em>d</em> was less good for his health than <em>c</em>
would be. Nothing puzzling about that.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>Joseph did <em>f</em> rather than <em>e</em>, even though he was
convinced that <em>e</em> was the better thing to do all things
considered.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Here, by contrast, we have a genuinely puzzling case, one we cannot
make sense of in the same way. Why would Joseph do <em>f</em> when he
assessed <em>e</em> as the superior course of action <em>all things
considered</em>? Joseph&rsquo;s choice sounds so inexplicable that we
might even query whether the case has been accurately described. If
Joseph is really freely choosing <em>f</em> over <em>e</em>, we might
think it questionable that he genuinely assesses <em>e</em> as better
all things considered. Perhaps he actually takes <em>f</em> to be
superior (for him, under the circumstances), although he thinks most
people would opt for <em>e</em> or would say <em>e</em> was a better
choice.</p>

<p>
Our divergent reactions to these three examples point to something
distinctive about the judgment that one course of action is better
than another. (Better <em>overall</em>, or better all things
considered, that is&mdash;not simply better in some respect.) Such
judgments appear to enjoy a special connection to the agent&rsquo;s
actions which other judgments do not possess. We are puzzled by
Joseph&rsquo;s choice precisely because we expect people&rsquo;s
actions&mdash;at least when freely undertaken&mdash;to reflect their
overall assessment of the merits of the alternative courses of action
before them. And Joseph&rsquo;s&mdash;at least as reported
above&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t. When assessment and action are said to have
diverged in this way, we are often sceptical: we question whether the
agent really held the course of action he considered but rejected to
be better. Moreover, even when we accept the description of the case,
we find such action somehow puzzling, defective, or dubiously
intelligible, in a way that action contrary to one&rsquo;s judgments
of financial wisdom (for example) is not. It seems that the judgment
contrary to which Joseph acts&mdash;the judgment that one course of
action is better than another&mdash;has what we can vaguely term a
special character, in comparison with other judgments such as that one
course of action would be healthier or more costly than another.</p>

<p>
Let us give a name to the assessment of his options contrary to which
Joseph acts. Let us call his judgment that <em>e</em> is a better
thing to do all things considered Joseph&rsquo;s <em>better
judgment</em>. (&ldquo;Better judgment&rdquo; does not mean
&ldquo;superior judgment&rdquo;; it simply means a judgment as to
which option is overall better.) Joseph, then, appears to have acted,
freely and intentionally, contrary to his better judgment. This is
precisely the phenomenon the philosophical tradition calls
&ldquo;weakness of
 will.&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Philosophers have been perplexed by or dubious about such action for
a very long
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Indeed, Plato&rsquo;s Socrates famously denied its possibility in the
<em>Protagoras</em>. &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;who
either knows or believes that there is another possible course of
action, better than the one he is following, will ever continue on his
present course&rdquo; (<em>Protagoras</em>
 358b&ndash;c).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Philosophers have been wrestling with the issue ever since. It is not
surprising that weakness of will has such a long and distinguished
pedigree as a topic of philosophical discussion: it is both an
intrinsically interesting phenomenon and a topic rich in implications
for our broader theories of action, practical reasoning, rationality,
evaluative judgment, and the interrelations among these.</p>

<h2 id="HareImpoWeakWill">1. Hare on the Impossibility of Weakness of Will</h2>

<p>
Let us commence our examination of contemporary discussions of this
issue in appropriately Socratic vein, with an account that gives
expression to and builds on many of the intuitions that lead us to be
sceptical about reports like (3) above. For the moral philosopher R.
M. Hare&mdash;as for Socrates&mdash;it is impossible for a person to
do one thing if he genuinely and in the fullest sense holds that he
ought instead to do something else. (If, that is&mdash;to echo the
earlier quote from Socrates&mdash;he &ldquo;believes that there is
another possible course of action, better than the one he is
following.&rdquo;) This certainly seems to constitute a denial of the
possibility of akratic or weak-willed action. In Hare&rsquo;s case it
is a consequence of the general account of the nature of evaluative
judgments which he defends (Hare 1952; see also Hare 1963).</p>

<p>
Hare is much impressed by what we vaguely referred to above as the
&ldquo;special character&rdquo; of evaluative judgments, such as the
judgment that one course of action is <em>better</em> than another, or
that one <em>ought</em> to do a certain
 thing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Such &ldquo;value-judgments&rdquo; (Hare&rsquo;s term) seem different
from merely &ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; judgments like that one thing is
more expensive than another, or rounder than another (Hare 1952, ch.
7; Hare 1963, ch. 2). In particular, evaluative judgments seem to bear
a special connection to <em>action</em> which no purely descriptive
judgment possesses. We can see that Hare&rsquo;s analysis begins from
something like the data we rehearsed above. Here is how he develops
those data into a theory. He identifies as the fundamental distinctive
feature of evaluative judgments&mdash;the feature responsible for
their special character&mdash;that such judgments are intended to
<em>guide conduct</em>. (See, e.g., Hare 1952, p. 1; p. 29; p. 46; p.
125; p. 127; p. 142, pp. 171; Hare 1963, p. 67; p. 70.) The special
function of evaluative judgments is to be action-guiding: that is, if
you will, what evaluative judgments are <em>for</em>. Hare then
proposes a more precise gloss on what it is for a judgment to
&ldquo;guide conduct&rdquo;: an action-guiding judgment is one which
<em>entails</em> an answer to the practical question &ldquo;What shall
I do?&rdquo; (Hare 1952, p. 29; see Hare 1963, p. 54 for the
terminology &ldquo;practical question&rdquo;). What is it, though,
that an action-guiding judgment must entail? In other words, what
would count as an answer to the question &ldquo;What shall I
do?&rdquo; Hare holds that no <em>descriptive</em> statement can
constitute an answer to such a question; only a first-person
<em>command</em> or <em>imperative</em> can answer it (Hare 1952, p.
29; p. 46). The relevant first-person imperative could be expressed in
words as &ldquo;Let me do <em>a</em>&rdquo; (Hare 1963, p. 55).</p>

<p>
To recap the argument thus far: it is the function of evaluative
judgments like &ldquo;I ought to do <em>a</em>&rdquo; to guide
conduct. A judgment can guide conduct only if it entails an answer to
the question &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; An answer to that question
must take the form of the first-person command or imperative
&ldquo;Let me do <em>a.</em>&rdquo; Therefore, first-person evaluative
judgments must entail first-person imperatives (Hare 1952, p. 192).
Now in general, if judgment <em>J</em><sub>1</sub> entails judgment
<em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, then assenting to <em>J</em><sub>1</sub> must
involve assenting to <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>: someone who professed to
assent to <em>J</em><sub>1</sub> but who disclaimed
<em>J</em><sub>2</sub> would be held not to have spoken correctly when
he claimed to assent to <em>J</em><sub>1</sub> (Hare 1952, pp.
171&ndash;2). Assenting to the evaluative judgment &ldquo;I ought to
do <em>a,</em>&rdquo; then, involves assenting to the first-person
command &ldquo;Let me do <em>a</em>&rdquo; (Hare 1952, pp.
168&ndash;9). But what is involved in sincerely assenting to a
first-person command or imperative of that type? Just as sincere
assent to a statement involves <em>believing</em> that statement,
sincere assent to an imperative addressed to ourselves means
<em>doing</em> the thing in question if we can:</p>

<blockquote>
It is a tautology to say that we cannot sincerely assent to a &hellip;
command addressed to ourselves, and <em>at the same time</em> not
perform it, if now is the occasion for performing it and it is in our
(physical and psychological) power to do so. (Hare 1952, p. 20)
</blockquote>

<p>
So: provided it is within my power to do <em>a</em> now, if I do not
do <em>a</em> now it follows that I do not genuinely judge that I
ought to do <em>a</em> now. Thus, as Hare states at the very opening
of his book, a person&rsquo;s evaluative judgments are revealed by his
actions and choices:</p>

<blockquote>
If we were to ask of a person &lsquo;What are his moral
principles?&rsquo; the way in which we could be most sure of a true
answer would be by studying what he <em>did</em>&hellip;. It would be
when &hellip; he was faced with choices or decisions between
alternative courses of action, between alternative answers to the
question &lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo;, that he would reveal in what
principles of conduct he really believed. (Hare 1952, p. 1)
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that Hare is not simply saying that a person&rsquo;s actions are
the most reliable source of evidence as to his evaluative judgments,
or that if a person did <em>b</em> the most likely hypothesis is that
he judged <em>b</em> to be the best thing to do. Hare is saying,
rather, that it <em>follows</em> from a person&rsquo;s having done
<em>b</em> that he judged <em>b</em> best from among the options open
to him at the time. On this view, akratic or weak-willed actions as we
have understood them are impossible. There could not be a case in
which someone genuinely and in the fullest sense held that he ought to
do <em>a</em> now (where <em>a</em> was within his power) and yet did
<em>b</em>. On Hare&rsquo;s view, &ldquo;it becomes analytic to say
that everyone always does what he thinks he ought to [if physically
and psychologically able]&rdquo; (Hare 1952, p. 169).</p>

<p>
But <em>does</em> everyone always do what he thinks he ought to, when
he is physically and psychologically able? It may seem that this is
simply not always the case (even if it is <em>usually</em> the case).
Have you, dear reader, <em>never</em> failed to get up off the couch
and turn off the TV when you judged it was really time to start
grading those papers? Have you <em>never</em> had one or two more
drinks than you thought best on balance? Have you <em>never</em>
deliberately pursued a sexual liaison which you viewed as an overall
bad idea? In short, have you <em>never</em> acted in a way which
departed from your overall evaluation of your options? If so, let me
be the first to congratulate you on your fortitude. While weak-willed
action does seem somehow puzzling, or defective in some important way,
<em>it does nonetheless seem to happen</em>.</p>

<p>
For Hare, however, any apparent case of <em>akrasia</em> must in fact
be one in which the agent is actually <em>unable</em> to do
<em>a</em>, or one in which the agent does not genuinely evaluate
<em>a</em> as better&mdash;even if he says he
 does.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 As an example of the first kind of case Hare cites Medea (Hare 1963,
pp. 78&ndash;9), who (he contends) is powerless, literally helpless,
in the face of the strong emotions and desires roiling her: she is
truly <em>unable</em> (psychologically) to resist the temptations
besieging her. A typical example of the second kind of case, on the
other hand, would be one in which the agent is actually using the
evaluative term &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;ought&rdquo; only in what
Hare calls an &ldquo;inverted-commas&rdquo; sense (Hare 1952, p. 120;
pp. 124&ndash;6; pp. 164&ndash;5; pp. 167&ndash;171). In such cases,
when the agent says (while doing <em>b</em>) &ldquo;I know I really
ought to do <em>a</em>,&rdquo; he means only that most
people&mdash;or, at any rate, the people whose opinions on such
matters are generally regarded as authoritative&mdash;would say he
ought to do <em>a</em>. As Hare notes (Hare 1952, p. 124), to believe
this is not to make an evaluative judgment oneself; rather, it is to
allude to the value-judgments of other people. Such an agent does not
himself assess the course of action he fails to follow as better than
the one he selects, even if other people would.</p>

<p>
No doubt there are cases of the two types Hare describes; but they do
not seem to exhaust the field. We can grant that there is the odd
murderer, overcome by irresistible homicidal urges but horrified at
what she is doing. But surely not every case that we might be tempted
to describe as one of acting contrary to one&rsquo;s better judgment
involves irresistible psychic forces. Consider, for example, the
following case memorably put forward by J. L. Austin:</p>

<blockquote>
I am very partial to ice cream, and a bombe is served divided into
segments corresponding one to one with the persons at High Table: I am
tempted to help myself to two segments and do so, thus succumbing to
temptation and even conceivably (but why necessarily?) going against
my principles. But do I lose control of myself? Do I raven, do I
snatch the morsels from the dish and wolf them down, impervious to the
consternation of my colleagues? Not a bit of it. We often succumb to
temptation with calm and even with finesse. (Austin 1956/7, p. 198)
</blockquote>

<p>
(I might add that it also seems doubtful that irresistible psychic
forces kept you on the couch watching TV while those papers were
waiting.) As for the &ldquo;inverted-commas&rdquo; case, this too
surely happens: people do sometimes pay lip service to conventional
standards which they themselves do not really accept. But again, it
seems highly doubtful that this is true of all seeming cases of
weak-willed action. It seems depressingly possible to select and
implement one course of action while <em>genuinely believing</em> that
it is an overall worse choice than some other option open to you.</p>

<p>
Has something gone wrong? We started with the unexceptionable-sounding
thought that moral and evaluative judgments are intended to guide
conduct; we arrived at a blanket denial of the possibility of akratic
action which fits ill with observed facts. But if we are disinclined
to follow Hare this far we should ask what the alternative is, for it
may be even worse. For Hare, the answer is clear: our only other
option is to repudiate the idea that moral and other evaluative
judgments have a special character or nature, namely that of being
action-guiding. For we should recall that Hare presents all his
subsequent conclusions as simply following, through a series of steps,
from that initial thought. &ldquo;The reason why actions are in a
peculiar way revelatory of moral principles is that the function of
moral principles is to guide conduct,&rdquo; Hare continues in the
passage quoted earlier (Hare 1952, p. 1). For Hare, then, the only way
to escape his &ldquo;Socratic&rdquo; conclusion about weakness of will
would be to give up the idea that evaluative judgments are intended to
guide conduct, or to &ldquo;have [a] bearing upon our actions&rdquo;
(Hare 1963, p. 169; see also Hare 1952, p. 46; p. 143; p. 163; pp.
171&ndash;2; and Hare 1963, p. 70; p. 99).</p>

<p>
The choices before us, then, as presented by Hare, are Hare&rsquo;s
own view, or one which assigns no distinctive role in action or
practical thought to evaluative judgments, treating them as just like
any other judgment. We might call the first of these an extreme
version of (judgment) <em>internalism.</em> (This label is used to
mean many different things; here, I mean by it that certain judgments
have an internal or necessary connection to motivation and to action.)
By extension, we might usefully follow Michael Bratman in calling the
second type of view &ldquo;extreme externalism&rdquo; (Bratman 1979,
pp. 158&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
Extreme externalism also seems unsatisfactory, however. First, it
seems unable to explain why there should be anything perplexing or
problematical about action contrary to one&rsquo;s better judgment,
why there should be any philosophical problem about its possibility or
its analysis. On this kind of view, it seems, Joseph&rsquo;s choice
((3) above) should strike us as no more puzzling than Julie&rsquo;s or
Jimmy&rsquo;s ((1) or (2)). As Hare puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
On the view that we are considering, there is nothing odder about
thinking something the best thing to do in the circumstances, but not
doing it, than there is about thinking a stone the roundest stone in
the vicinity and not picking it up, but picking up some other stone
instead&hellip;. There will be nothing that requires explanation if I
choose to do what I think to be, say, the worst possible thing to do
and leave undone what I think the best thing to do. (Hare 1963, pp.
68&ndash;9)
</blockquote>

<p>
But our reactions to (1), (2), and (3) show that we <em>do</em> think
there is something peculiar about action contrary to one&rsquo;s
better judgment which renders such action hard to understand, or
perhaps even impossible. An extreme externalist view thus seems to
mischaracterize the status of akratic actions.</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more importantly, however, extreme externalism has
dramatic implications for our understanding of intentional action in
general&mdash;not just weak-willed action. For such a view implies
that</p>

<blockquote>
deliberation about what it would be best to do has no closer relation
to practical reasoning than, say, deliberation about what it would be
chic to do. If one happens to care about what it would be chic to do,
then a consideration of this matter may play an important role in
one&rsquo;s practical reasoning. If one does not care, it will be
irrelevant. The case is the same with reasoning about what it would be
best to do. (Bratman 1979, p. 158)
</blockquote>

<p>
To adopt a general doctrine of this sort seems an awfully precipitous
response to the possibility of <em>akrasia</em> (that is, weak-willed
action). For it seems extremely plausible to assign to our overall
evaluations of our options an important role in our choices. Man is a
rational animal, the saying goes; that is&mdash;to offer one gloss on
this idea&mdash;we act on reasons, and in light of our assessment of
the overall balance of reasons. When we engage in deliberation or
reasoning about what to do, we often proceed by thinking about the
reasons which favor our various options, and then bringing these
together into an overall assessment which is, precisely, intended to
guide our choice.</p>

<p>
Or, as Bratman puts it, we very often reason about what it is
<em>best</em> to do as a way of settling the question of what
<em>to</em> do. (He calls this &ldquo;evaluative practical
reasoning&rdquo;: Bratman 1979, p. 156.) &ldquo;One&rsquo;s
evaluations [thus] play a crucial role in the reasoning underlying
full-blown action,&rdquo; Bratman holds (p. 170), and to be forced to
deny this would be in his view &ldquo;too high a price to pay&rdquo;
(p. 159). As Alfred Mele similarly puts it, &ldquo;there is a real
danger that in attempting to make causal and conceptual space for
full-fledged akratic action one might commit oneself to the rejection
of genuine ties between evaluative judgment and action&rdquo; (1991,
p. 34). But that would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater. If
we want to resist Hare&rsquo;s conclusions, we must do so in a way
which steers clear of the danger to which Mele alerts us. We must
navigate between the Scylla of extreme internalism and the Charybdis
of extreme externalism.</p>

<h2 id="DaviPossWeakWill">2. Davidson on the Possibility of Weakness of Will</h2>

<p>
This is just what Donald Davidson set out to do in a rich, elegant,
and incisive paper published in 1970 which has had a towering
influence on the subsequent literature. Davidson&rsquo;s treatment
aims to vindicate the possibility of weakness of will; to offer a
novel analysis of its nature; to clarify its status as a marginal,
somehow defective instance of agency which we rightly find dubiously
intelligible; and to do all this within the contours of a general view
of practical reasoning and intentional action which assigns a central
and special role to our evaluative judgments. Let us see how he
proposes to do these things.</p>

<p>
First, Davidson offers the following general characterization of
weak-willed or incontinent
 action:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<blockquote>
In doing <em>b</em> an agent acts incontinently if and only if: (a)
the agent does <em>b</em> intentionally; (b) the agent believes there
is an alternative action <em>a</em> open to him; and (c) the agent
judges that, all things considered, it would be better to do
<em>a</em> than to do <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
We initially described weak-willed action as free, intentional action
contrary to the agent&rsquo;s better judgment; it may be useful to see
how Davidson&rsquo;s more precise definition matches up with that
initial characterization. Davidson&rsquo;s condition (a) requires that
the action in question be
 intentional.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Condition (b) seems intended to ensure that the action in question is
a <em>free</em>
 action.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Condition (c) of Davidson&rsquo;s definition represents what we have
called the agent&rsquo;s &ldquo;better judgment,&rdquo; that is, the
overall evaluation of his options contrary to which the incontinent
agent acts.</p>

<p>
Davidson notes that &ldquo;there is no proving such actions exist; but
it seems to me absolutely certain that they do&rdquo; (p. 29). Why,
then, is there a persistent tendency, both in philosophy and in
ordinary thought, to deny that such actions are possible?
Davidson&rsquo;s diagnosis is that two plausible principles which
&ldquo;derive their force from a very persuasive view of the nature of
intentional action and practical reasoning&rdquo; (p. 31) appear to
entail that incontinence is impossible. He articulates those two
principles as follows (p. 23):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>P1</strong>. If an agent wants to do <em>a</em> more than he
wants to do <em>b</em> and he believes himself free to do either
<em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, then he will intentionally do <em>a</em> if
he does either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> intentionally.</p>

<p>
<strong>P2</strong>. If an agent judges that it would be better to do
<em>a</em> than to do <em>b</em>, then he wants to do <em>a</em> more
than he wants to do <em>b</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
P2, Davidson observes, &ldquo;connects judgements of what it is better
to do with motivation or wanting&rdquo; (p. 23); he adds later that it
&ldquo;states a mild form of internalism&rdquo; (p. 26). Davidson is
proposing, <em>contra</em> the extreme externalist position, that our
evaluative judgments about the merits of the options we deem open to
us are not motivationally inert. While he admits that one could
quibble or tinker with the formulation of P1 and P2 (pp. 23&ndash;4;
p. 27; p. 31), he is confident that they or something like them give
expression to a powerfully attractive picture of practical reasoning
and intentional action, one which assigns an important motivational
role to the agent&rsquo;s evaluative
 judgments.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The difficulty is, though, that P1 and P2&mdash;however
attractive&mdash;together imply that an agent never intentionally does
<em>b</em> when he judges that it would be better to do <em>a</em> (if
he takes himself to be free to do either). And this certainly looks
like a denial of the possibility of incontinent action. No wonder,
then, that so many have been tempted to say that akratic action is
impossible! Looking carefully, however, we can see that P1 and P2 do
<em>not</em> imply the impossibility of incontinent actions <em>as
Davidson has defined them</em>. For Davidson characterizes the agent
who incontinently does <em>b</em> as holding, not that it would be
better to do <em>a</em> than to do <em>b</em>, but that it would be
better, <em>all things considered</em>, to do <em>a</em> than to do
<em>b</em>. Is the &ldquo;all things considered&rdquo; just a
rhetorical flourish? Or does it mark a genuine difference between the
two judgments? If these are two different judgments, and one can hold
the latter without holding the former, then incontinent action is
possible <em>even if P1 and P2 are true</em>.</p>

<p>
In the rest of his paper Davidson sets out to vindicate that very
possibility. The phrase &ldquo;all things considered&rdquo; is not, as
it might seem, merely a minor difference in wording that allows
weakness of will to get off on a technicality. Rather, that phrase
marks an important contrast in logical form to which we would need to
attend in any case in order properly to understand the structure of
practical reasoning. For that phrase indicates a judgment that is
<em>conditional</em> or <em>relational</em> rather than
<em>all-out</em> or <em>unconditional</em> in form; and that
difference is
 crucial.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 We can better see the relational character of an
all-things-considered judgment if we first look at evaluative
judgments that play an important role in an earlier phase of practical
reasoning, the phase where we consider what reasons or considerations
favor doing <em>a</em> and what reasons or considerations favor doing
<em>b</em>. (For simplicity, imagine a case in which an agent is
choosing only between two options known to be incompatible, <em>a</em>
and <em>b</em>.) These <em>prima facie</em> judgments, as Davidson
terms them, take the form:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>PF</strong>: In light of <em>r</em>, <em>a</em> is <em>prima
facie</em> better than <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
In this schema <em>r</em> refers to a consideration taken to be
relevant, such as the following: that <em>a</em> would be relaxing,
while <em>b</em> would be stressful. A PF judgment of this kind
identifies one respect in which <em>a</em> is superior to <em>b</em>,
one perspective from which <em>a</em> comes out on top.</p>

<p>
We should pause to note three things about PF judgments. (i) A PF
judgment is not a conclusion in favor of the overall superiority of
<em>a</em> (or <em>b</em>). Such &ldquo;all-out&rdquo; evaluative
judgments have a simpler logical form, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>AO</strong>: <em>a</em> is better than <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
(ii) Indeed, no AO conclusion <em>follows logically</em> from any PF
judgment. (iii) More strongly still: PF judgments do not in general
provide sufficient <em>grounds</em> for the corresponding AO
conclusion. Even if an agent makes one PF judgment which favors
<em>a</em> over <em>b</em>, as in the case we imagined, she may
<em>also</em> make <em>other</em> PF judgments which favor <em>b</em>
over <em>a</em> (say, one in which the following consideration plays
the role of <em>r:</em> that <em>b</em> would be lucrative, while
<em>a</em> would be expensive). We do not want to say in that case
that she has sufficient grounds to draw each of two incompatible
conclusions (that <em>a</em> is better than <em>b</em>, and that
<em>b</em> is better than <em>a</em>; these are incompatible provided
the better-than relation is asymmetric, assumed here).</p>

<p>
We have contrasted PF judgments with AO or &ldquo;all-out&rdquo;
evaluative judgments. PF judgments are relational in character: they
point out a <em>relation</em> which holds between the consideration
<em>r</em> and doing <em>a</em> (or <em>b</em>). (We could call that
relation the &ldquo;favoring&rdquo; relation.) That relation is not
such as to permit us to &ldquo;detach&rdquo; (as Davidson puts it, p.
37) an unconditional evaluative conclusion in favor of doing
<em>a</em> (or <em>b</em>) from PF and the supposition that <em>r</em>
obtains. That is, we are not to understand PF judgments as having the
form of a material conditional.</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s innovative suggestion is that judgments with this PF
logical form are an appropriate way to model what happens in the early
stages of practical reasoning, where we rehearse reasons for and
against the options we are considering. And his stressing that no such
PF judgment commits the agent to an overall evaluative conclusion in
favor of <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> is useful in thinking about a case
like Julie&rsquo;s ((1) above). We described Julie as knowing (and
therefore believing) that <em>b</em> was more expensive than
<em>a</em>, but opting for <em>b</em> nonetheless. We can imagine,
then, that among the ingredients of Julie&rsquo;s practical reasoning
was a PF judgment like this:</p>

<blockquote>
In light of the fact that <em>b</em> is more expensive than
<em>a</em>, <em>a</em> is <em>prima facie</em> better than <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
But this PF judgment alone, as we have seen, does not commit her to
the overall judgment that <em>a</em> is better than <em>b</em>. For
she may also have made other PF judgments, such as</p>

<blockquote>
In light of the fact that <em>b</em> would be much more
gastronomically exciting than <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> is <em>prima
facie</em> better than <em>a</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
We would not want to say that Julie now has sufficient grounds both to
conclude that <em>a</em> is better than <em>b</em> and to conclude
that <em>b</em> is better than <em>a</em>. Her premises all seem
consistent; they do not provide her with sufficient grounds to embrace
a contradiction. Thus her various PF judgments, when considered
separately, must <em>not</em> each commit her to a corresponding
overall conclusion in favor of <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>.</p>

<p>
Practical reasoning, Davidson suggests, starts from judgments like
these, each identifying one respect in which one of the options is
superior. But in order to make progress in our practical reasoning we
shall eventually need to consider how <em>a</em> compares to
<em>b</em> not just with respect to <em>one</em> consideration, but in
light of several considerations taken together. That is, Julie will
eventually need to consider how to fill in the blanks in a PF judgment
like this:</p>

<blockquote>
In light of the fact that <em>b</em> is more expensive than <em>a</em>
<em>and</em> the fact that <em>b</em> would be much more
gastronomically exciting than <em>a</em>, &hellip; is <em>prima
facie</em> better than &hellip;.
</blockquote>

<p>
This PF judgment is more <em>comprehensive</em> than the ones we
attributed to Julie a moment ago, as it takes into account a broader
range of considerations. (I take the term &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;
from Lazar 1999.) Now in Julie&rsquo;s case we can surmise how she
filled in those blanks: with &ldquo;<em>b</em> is <em>prima facie</em>
better than <em>a</em>.&rdquo; Julie&rsquo;s filling in the blanks in
that way can naturally be taken as expressing the view that the much
greater gastronomic excitement promised by <em>b</em>
<em>outweighs</em> or <em>overrides</em> <em>b</em>&rsquo;s
inferiority to <em>a</em> from a strictly financial standpoint.</p>

<p>
We thus need to generalize our schema for PF judgments so that
comparative assessments of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> can be
relativized, not just to a single consideration, but to multiple
considerations taken together or as a body:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>PF<em><sub>n</sub></em></strong>: In light of
&lang;<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>r<sub>n</sub></em>&rang;,
<em>a</em> is <em>prima facie</em> better than <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that PF<em><sub>n</sub></em> judgments are still relational in
form: they assert that a relation (the &ldquo;favoring&rdquo;
relation) holds between the <em>set</em> of considerations
&lang;<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>r<sub>n</sub></em>&rang;
and <em>a</em> (or <em>b</em>). Indeed, the relational character of a
PF<em><sub>n</sub></em> judgment remains even if we make it as
comprehensive as we can: if we expand the set
&lang;<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>r<sub>n</sub></em>&rang;
to incorporate <em>all</em> the considerations the agent deems
relevant to her decision. Following Davidson (p. 38), let us give the
label <em>e</em> to that set. So even the following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>ATC</strong>: In light of <em>e</em>, <em>a</em> is <em>prima
facie</em> better than <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
is a relational or conditional judgment and not an all-out conclusion
in favor of doing <em>a</em>. To make a judgment of the above form
does <em>not</em> commit one to drawing an overall conclusion in favor
of doing <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>
We may be better able to see this by considering an analogy from
theoretical reason. Suppose Hercule Poirot has been called in to
investigate a murder. We can imagine him assessing bits of evidence as
he encounters them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In light of the fact that the murder weapon belongs to Colonel
Mustard, Mustard looks guilty;</p>

<p>
In light of his having an alibi for the time of the murder, Mustard
looks not guilty;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and so on. These are theoretical analogues of the PF judgments
relativized to single considerations which we looked at earlier.
However, Poirot will eventually need to consider how these various
bits of evidence add up; that is, he will eventually need to fill in
the blanks in a more comprehensive PF<sub><em>n</em></sub> judgment
like this:</p>

<blockquote>
In light of &lang;<em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>e<sub>n</sub></em>&rang;, &hellip; looks to be the guilty party,
</blockquote>

<p>
where &lang;<em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>e<sub>n</sub></em>&rang; is a set of bits of pertinent evidence.
Notice, though, that no such PF<sub><em>n</em></sub> judgment actually
constitutes settling on a particular person as the culprit. Suppose we
take a maximally large &lang;<em>e</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>e<sub>n</sub></em>&rang; consisting of <em>all</em> the evidence
Poirot has seen, and imagine him thinking</p>

<blockquote>
The body of evidence I have seen points on balance toward Colonel
Mustard as the guilty party.
</blockquote>

<p>
Still, to make this observation is manifestly <em>not</em> to conclude
that Mustard is guilty. Poirot may feel he needs more evidence before
he can do <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>
In the same way, an ATC or all-things-considered judgment, although
comprehensive, is still relational in nature, and therefore distinct
from an AO judgment in favor of <em>a</em>. It is at least
<em>possible</em> to make an ATC judgment in favor of <em>a</em>
without making the corresponding AO judgment in favor of <em>a.</em>
(That is roughly the position Poirot is in.) This possibility is the
key to Davidson&rsquo;s solution to the problem of how weakness of
will is possible. For ATC is, precisely, <em>the agent&rsquo;s better
judgment</em> as Davidson construes it in his definition of
incontinent action. P1 and P2 together imply that an agent who reaches
an <em>AO</em> conclusion in favor of <em>a</em> will not
intentionally do <em>b</em>. But the incontinent agent never reaches
such an AO conclusion. With respect to <em>a</em>, he remains stuck at
the Hercule Poirot stage: he sees that the considerations he has
rehearsed, taken as a body, favor <em>a</em>, but he is not willing to
make a commitment to <em>a</em> as the thing to
 do.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 He makes only a relational ATC judgment in favor of <em>a</em>,
contrary to which he then acts.</p>

<p>
What should we say about an agent who does this? Let&rsquo;s return to
the three features of <em>prima facie</em> or PF judgments which we
noted earlier. (i) was that a PF judgment is not a conclusion in favor
of the overall superiority of <em>a</em> (or <em>b</em>). (ii) was
that no AO conclusion <em>follows logically</em> from any PF judgment.
These two features hold even of the special subclass of PF judgments
which are ATC judgments. Such judgments neither are equivalent to, nor
logically imply, any AO judgment. This establishes that the
incontinent agent who fails to draw the AO conclusion which
corresponds to his ATC conclusion, and to perform the corresponding
action, is not committing &ldquo;a simple logical blunder&rdquo; (p.
40). Notably, he does not contradict himself. He does, however,
exhibit a defect in rationality, on Davidson&rsquo;s account. Recall
feature (iii) of PF judgments: that they do not in general provide
sufficient grounds for the corresponding AO conclusion. But this does
<em>not</em> hold of the special subclass of such judgments which are
ATC judgments. Drawing an <em>ATC</em> conclusion in favor of
<em>a</em> <em>does</em> give one sufficient grounds to conclude that
<em>a</em> is better <em>sans phrase</em> and, indeed, to do
<em>a</em>. For Davidson proposes that the transition from an ATC
judgment in favor of <em>a</em> to the corresponding AO judgment, and
to doing <em>a</em>, is enjoined by a substantive principle of
rationality which he dubs &ldquo;the principle of continence.&rdquo;
That principle tells us to &ldquo;perform the action judged best on
the basis of all available relevant reasons&rdquo; (p. 41); and the
incontinent agent violates this injunction. [NEW NOTE:
Davidson&rsquo;s principle is stronger than it needs to be. To secure
the result that the incontinent agent violates the principle of
continence, it is not necessary that the principle instruct us <em>to
perform</em> the action which satisfies that description. It is
sufficient if it merely enjoins us <em>not</em> to perform some
<em>alternative</em> action.] The principle of continence thus
substantiates the idea that &ldquo;what is wrong is that the
incontinent man acts, and judges, irrationally, for this is surely
what we must say of a man who goes against his own best
judgement&rdquo; (p. 41). He acts irrationally in virtue of violating
this substantive principle, obedience to which is a necessary
condition for rationality.</p>

<p>
We must put this point about the irrationality of incontinence with
some care, however. For recall that an incontinent action must itself
be intentional, that is, done for a reason. The weak-willed agent,
then, must have a reason for doing <em>b;</em> indeed he does
<em>b</em> for that reason. What he lacks&mdash;and lacks by his own
lights&mdash;is a <em>sufficient</em> reason to do <em>b</em>, given
all the considerations that he takes to favor <em>a</em>. As Davidson
puts it, if we ask &ldquo;what is the agent&rsquo;s reason for doing
[<em>b</em>] when he believes it would be better, all things
considered, to do another thing, then the answer must be: for this,
the agent has no reason&rdquo; (p. 42). What Davidson seems to have in
mind is that while the agent does have a reason for doing <em>b</em>
(p. 42, n. 25), he lacks a reason <em>to do</em> b <em>rather than
</em>a. By his own lights, he has no <em>adequate</em> reason for
doing <em>b</em>; thus he cannot make sense of his own action.
&ldquo;He recognizes, in his own intentional behaviour, something
essentially surd&rdquo; (p. 42). So akratic action, while
<em>possible</em> on Davidson&rsquo;s account, is nonetheless
necessarily <em>irrational</em>. That is the sense in which it is a
defective and not fully intelligible exercise of agency, despite being
a very real phenomenon.</p>

<h2 id="DebaAfteDavi">3. The Debate After Davidson</h2>

<h3 id="InteExteStra">3.1 Internalist and Externalist Strands</h3>

<p>
Davidson has certainly presented an arresting theory of practical
reasoning. But has he shown how weakness of the will is possible? Most
philosophers writing after him, while acknowledging his pathbreaking
work on the issue, think he has not. One principal difficulty which
subsequent theorists have seized on is that Davidson&rsquo;s view can
account for the possibility of action contrary to one&rsquo;s better
judgment <em>only if</em> one&rsquo;s better judgment is construed
merely as a conditional or <em>prima facie</em> judgment.
Davidson&rsquo;s P1 and P2 do genuinely rule out the possibility of
free intentional action contrary to an all-out or unconditional
evaluative judgment. But it seems that such cases exist. Michael
Bratman, for instance, introduces us to Sam, who, in a depressed
state, is deep into a bottle of wine, despite his acknowledged need
for an early wake-up and a clear head tomorrow (1979, p. 156).
Sam&rsquo;s friend, stopping by, says:</p>

<blockquote>
Look here. Your reasons for abstaining seem clearly stronger than your
reasons for drinking. So how can you have thought that it would be
best to drink?
</blockquote>

<p>
To which Sam replies:</p>

<blockquote>
I don&rsquo;t think it would be best to drink. Do you think I&rsquo;m
stupid enough to think that, given how strong my reasons for
abstaining are? I think it would be best to abstain. Still, I&rsquo;m
drinking.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sam&rsquo;s case certainly seems possible as described.
Davidson&rsquo;s view, though, must reject it as
 impossible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Given his conduct, Sam can&rsquo;t think it best to abstain; at most,
he thinks it all-things-considered best to abstain, a very different
kettle of fish. But this seems false of Sam: there is no evidence that
he has remained stuck at the Hercule Poirot stage with respect to the
superiority of abstaining. He seems to have gone all the way to a
judgment <em>sans phrase</em> that abstaining would be better; and yet
he drinks.</p>

<p>
Ironically, this complaint makes Davidson out to be a bit like Hare.
Like Hare, Davidson subscribes to an internalist principle (P2) which
connects evaluative judgments with motivation and hence with action.
(Indeed, in light of the difficulty raised here, one might wonder if
Davidson is entitled to consider P2 a &ldquo;mild&rdquo; form of
internalism, as he claims (p. 26).) As with Hare, this internalist
commitment rules out as impossible certain kinds of action contrary to
one&rsquo;s evaluative judgment. Now Davidson, like Hare, does accept
the possibility of certain phenomena in this neighborhood;
but&mdash;as with Hare&mdash;critics think the cases permitted by his
analysis fail to exhaust the range of actual cases of weakness of
will. The phenomenon seems to run one step ahead of our attempts to
make room for it.</p>

<p>
Those writing after Davidson have tended to focus, then, on the
question of the possibility and rational status of action contrary to
one&rsquo;s <em>unconditional</em> better
 judgment.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 Naturally, different theorists have plotted different courses through
these shoals. Some tack more to the internalist side, wishing to
preserve a strong internal connection between evaluation and action
even at the risk of denying or seeming to deny the possibility of
akratic action (or at least some understandings of it). Examples of
some post-Davidson treatments which share a broadly internalist
emphasis, even if they feature different flavors of internalism, are
those of Bratman (1979), Buss (1997), Tenenbaum (1999; see also 2007,
ch. 7), and Stroud (2003). The main danger for such approaches is that
in seeking to preserve and defend a certain picture of the primordial
role of evaluative thought in rational action&mdash;a picture critics
are likely to dismiss as too rationalistic&mdash;such theorists may be
led to reject common phenomena which ought properly to have
constrained their more abstract theories. (See the opening of Wiggins
1979 for a forceful articulation of this criticism.)</p>

<p>
Other theorists, by contrast, are more drawn toward the externalist
shoreline. They emphasize the motivational importance of factors other
than the agent&rsquo;s evaluative judgment and the divergences that
can result between an agent&rsquo;s evaluation of her options and her
motivation to act. They are thus disinclined to posit any strong,
necessary link between evaluative judgment and action. Michael
Stocker, for instance, argues that the philosophical tradition has
been led astray in assuming that evaluation dictates motivation.
&ldquo;Motivation and evaluation do not stand in a simple and direct
relation to each other, as so often supposed,&rdquo; he writes.
Rather, &ldquo;their interrelations are mediated by large arrays of
complex psychic structures, such as mood, energy, and interest&rdquo;
(1979, pp. 738&ndash;9). Similarly, Alfred Mele proposes as a
fundamental and general truth&mdash;and one that underlies the
possibility of <em>akrasia</em>&mdash;that &ldquo;the motivational
force of a want may be out of line with the agent&rsquo;s evaluation
of the object of that want&rdquo; (1987, p. 37). Mele goes on to offer
several different reasons why the two can come apart: for example,
rewards perceived as <em>proximate</em> can exert a motivational
influence disproportionate to the value the agent reflectively
attaches to them (1987, ch. 6). Such wants may function as strong
<em>causes</em> even if the agent takes them to constitute weak
<em>reasons</em>.</p>

<p>
With respect to these questions, the challenge sketched at the end of
Section 1 above remains in full force. What is required is a view
which successfully navigates between the Scylla of an extreme
internalism about evaluative judgment which would preclude the
possibility of weakness of will, and the Charybdis of an extreme
externalism which would deny any privileged role to evaluative
judgment in practical reasoning or rational action. For one&rsquo;s
verdict about <em>akrasia</em> will in general be closely connected to
one&rsquo;s more general views of action, practical reasoning,
rationality, and evaluative judgment&mdash;as was certainly true of
Davidson.</p>

<p>
Views that downplay the role of evaluative judgment in action and
hence tack more toward the externalist side of the channel may more
easily be able to accept the possibility and indeed the actuality of
weakness of will. But they are subject to their own challenges. For
example, suppose we follow Mele&rsquo;s image of <em>akrasia</em> and
posit that a certain agent is caused to do <em>x</em> by motivation to
do <em>x</em> which is dramatically out of kilter with her assessment
of the merits of doing <em>x</em>. This agent is horrified by the idea
of doing <em>x</em>, say, but finds herself doing it anyway. We might
wonder whether in that case her doing <em>x</em> is genuinely free,
intentional, and uncompelled. Such an agent might seem instead to be
at the mercy of a motivational force which is, from her point of view,
utterly alien. Thus, worries about distinguishing <em>akrasia</em>
from compulsion come back in full force in connection with proposals
like these. (See
 <a href="notes.html#note-7">fn. 7</a>
 above for relevant references; Buss and Tenenbaum press these worries
against accounts like Mele&rsquo;s in particular.) Moreover, there is
the danger, for accounts of this more externalist stripe, of taking
too much of the mystery out of weakness of will. Even if akratic
action is possible and indeed actual, it remains a puzzling, marginal,
somehow defective instance of agency, one that we rightly find not
fully intelligible. Views that do not assign a privileged place in
rational deliberation and action to the agent&rsquo;s overall
assessment of her options risk making akratic action seem no more
problematic than Julie&rsquo;s or Jimmy&rsquo;s decisions, or
Hare&rsquo;s agent who fails to pick up the roundest stone in the
vicinity.</p>

<h3 id="WeakWillPoteRati">3.2 Weakness of Will as Potentially Rational</h3>

<p>
The &ldquo;externalist turn&rdquo; toward downplaying the role of an
agent&rsquo;s better judgment and emphasizing other psychic factors
instead is connected to a second way in which some theorists writing
after Davidson have dissented from his analysis. Davidson, as we saw,
viewed akratic action as possible, but irrational. The weak-willed
agent acts contrary to what she herself takes to be the balance of
reasons; her choice is thus unreasonable by her own lights. On this
picture, incontinent action is a paradigm case of practical
irrationality. Many other theorists have agreed with Davidson on this
score and have taken <em>akrasia</em> to be perhaps the clearest
example of practical irrationality. But some writers (notably Audi
1990, McIntyre 1990, and Arpaly 2000) have questioned whether akratic
action <em>is</em> necessarily irrational. Perhaps we ought to leave
room, not just for the <em>possibility</em> of akratic action, but for
the potential <em>rationality</em> of akratic action.</p>

<p>
The irrationality which is held necessarily to attach to akratic
action derives from the discrepancy between what the agent judges to
be the best (or better) thing to do, and what she does. That is, her
action is faulted as irrational in virtue of not conforming to her
better judgment. But&mdash;ask these critics&mdash;what if her better
judgment is itself faulty? There is nothing magical about an
agent&rsquo;s better judgment that ensures that it is correct, or even
warranted; like any other judgment, it can be in error, or even
unjustified. (Recall that by &ldquo;better judgment&rdquo; we meant,
all along, only &ldquo;a judgment as to which course of action is
better,&rdquo; not &ldquo;a <em>superior</em> judgment.&rdquo;)
Suppose the agent&rsquo;s better judgment is itself defective. Then
&ldquo;even though the akratic agent does not believe that she is
doing what she has most reason to do, it may nevertheless be the case
that the course of action that she is pursuing is the one that she has
&hellip; most reason to pursue&rdquo; (McIntyre 1990, p. 385). In that
sense the akratic agent may be wiser than her own better judgment.</p>

<p>
How, concretely, could an agent&rsquo;s better judgment go astray in
this way? Perhaps her survey of what she took to be the relevant
considerations did not include, or did not attach sufficient weight
to, what were in fact significant reasons in favor of one of the
possible courses of action. She may have overlooked these, or
(wrongly) deemed them not to be reasons, or failed to appreciate their
full force; and in that case her judgment of what it is best to do
will be incorrect. Consider, for example, Jonathan Bennett&rsquo;s
Huckleberry Finn (Bennett 1974, discussed in McIntyre 1990), who
akratically fails to turn in his slave friend Jim to the authorities.
Huck&rsquo;s judgment that he ought to do so, however, was based
primarily on what he took to be the force of Miss Watson&rsquo;s
property rights; it ignored his powerful feelings of friendship and
affection for Jim, as well as other highly relevant factors. His
&ldquo;better judgment&rdquo; was thus <em>not</em> in fact a very
comprehensive judgment; it did not actually take into account the full
range of relevant considerations.</p>

<p>
Or consider Emily, who has always thought it best that she pursue a
Ph.D. in chemistry (Arpaly 2000, p. 504). When she revisits the issue,
as she does periodically, she discounts her increasing feelings of
restlessness, sadness, and lack of motivation as she proceeds in the
program, and concludes that she ought to persevere. But in fact she
has very good reasons to quit the program&mdash;her talents are not
well suited to a career in chemistry, and the people who are thriving
in the program are very different from her. If she impulsively,
akratically quits the program, purely on the basis of her feelings,
Emily is in fact doing just what she ought to
 do.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 That her action conflicts with her better judgment does not
significantly impugn its rationality, given all the considerations
that <em>do</em> support her quitting the program. &ldquo;A theory of
rationality should not assume that there is something special about an
agent&rsquo;s best judgment. An agent&rsquo;s best judgment is just
another belief&rdquo; (Arpaly 2000, p. 512). Emily&rsquo;s action
conflicts, then, with one belief she has; but it coheres with many
more of her beliefs and desires overall. Although she may find her own
action inexplicable or &ldquo;surd,&rdquo; she is in fact acting
rationally, even though she does not know it. <em>Contra</em>
Davidson, &ldquo;we can &hellip; act rationally just when we cannot
make any sense of our actions&rdquo; (Arpaly 2000, p. 513).</p>

<p>
It is unclear, however, whether these arguments and examples are
likely to sway those who take <em>akrasia</em> to be a paradigm of
practical irrationality. These dissenters stress the <em>substantive
merits</em> of the course of action the akratic agent follows. But
traditionalists may say that is beside the point: however well things
turn out, the practical thinking of the akratic agent still exhibits a
<em>procedural defect</em>. Someone who flouts her own conclusion
about where the balance of reasons lies has <em>ipso facto</em> gone
astray in her practical reasoning. Even if the action she performs is
in fact supported by the balance of reasons, she does not think it is,
and that is enough to show her practical reasoning to be faulty. The
defenders of the traditional conception of <em>akrasia</em> as
irrational thus wish to grant special rational authority (in this
procedural sense) to the agent&rsquo;s better judgment, even if they
admit that such a judgment can be substantively incorrect. By
contrast, the dissenters &ldquo;[do] not believe best judgments have
any privileged role&rdquo; (Arpaly 2000, p. 513). We see again the
contrast between &ldquo;internalist&rdquo; and
&ldquo;externalist&rdquo; tendencies in the debates over weakness of
will.</p>

<h3 id="ChanSubj">3.3 Changing the Subject</h3>

<p>
Further revisionist strands take the agent&rsquo;s better judgment
even farther out of the picture. In an outstandingly lucid and
stimulating essay published in 1999 (see also his 2009, ch. 4),
Richard Holton argued that weakness of will is not action contrary to
one&rsquo;s better judgment at all. The literature has gone astray in
understanding weakness of will in this way; weakness of will is
actually quite a different phenomenon, in which the agent&rsquo;s
better judgment plays no
 role.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 For Holton, when ordinary people speak of weakness of will they have
in mind a certain kind of failure to act on one&rsquo;s
<em>intentions</em>. What matters for weakness of will, then, is not
whether you deem another course of action superior at the time of
action. It is whether you are abandoning an intention you previously
formed. Weakness of will as the untutored understand it is not
<em>akrasia</em> (if we reserve that term for action contrary to
one&rsquo;s better judgment), but rather a certain kind of failure to
stick to one&rsquo;s
 plans.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 This understanding of weakness of will changes the subject in two
ways. First, the state of the agent with which the weak-willed action
is in conflict is not an evaluative judgment (as in <em>akrasia</em>)
but a different kind of state, namely an intention. Second, it is not
essential that there be <em>synchronic</em> conflict, as
<em>akrasia</em> demands. You must act contrary to your
<em>present</em> better judgment in order to exhibit <em>akrasia</em>;
conflict with a <em>previous</em> better judgment does not indicate
<em>akrasia</em>, but merely a change of mind. However, you can
exhibit weakness of will as Holton understands it simply by abandoning
a previously formed intention.</p>

<p>
Of course not all cases of abandoning or failing to act on a
previously formed intention count as weakness of will. I intend to run
five miles tomorrow evening. If I break my leg tomorrow morning and
fail to run five miles tomorrow evening, I will not have exhibited
weakness of will. How can we characterize <em>which</em> failures to
act on a previously formed intention count as weakness of will?
Holton&rsquo;s answer has two parts. First, he says, there is an
irreducible normative dimension to the question whether
someone&rsquo;s abandoning of an intention constituted weakness of
will (Holton 1999, p.
 259).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 That is, there is no purely descriptive criterion (such as whether
her action was contrary to her better judgment) which is sufficient
for weakness of will; in order to decide whether a given case was an
instance of weakness of will we must consider normative questions,
such as whether it was <em>reasonable</em> for the agent to have
abandoned or revised that intention, or whether she <em>should</em>
have done so. In the case of my broken leg, for instance, it was
clearly reasonable for me to abandon my intention; that is why I could
not be charged with weakness of will in that case.</p>

<p>
Second, says Holton, we need to attend to an important subclass of our
intentions to do something at a future time, namely
<em>contrary-inclination-defeating</em> <em>intentions</em>, or, as he
later terms them (Holton 2003), <em>resolutions</em>. Resolutions are
intentions that are formed precisely in order to insulate one against
contrary inclinations which one expects to feel when the time comes.
Thus one reason I might form an intention on Monday to run five miles
on Tuesday&mdash;as opposed to leaving the issue open until Tuesday,
for decision then&mdash;is to reduce the effect of feelings of
lassitude to which I fear I may be subject when Tuesday rolls around.
Then suppose Tuesday rolls around; I am indeed prey to feelings of
lassitude; and I decide as a result not to run. <em>Now</em> I can be
charged with weakness of will. Weakness of will involves,
specifically, a failure to act on a <em>resolution</em>; this is
sufficient to differentiate weakness of will from mere change of mind
and even from caprice (which is a <em>different</em> species of
unreasonable intention revision, according to Holton).</p>

<p>
As a later paper by Alison McIntyre shows (McIntyre 2006),
understanding weakness of will in this way casts a fresh light on the
issue of its rational status. The weak-willed agent abandons a
resolution because of a contrary inclination of exactly the type which
the resolution was expressly designed to defeat. Thus, as McIntyre
underlines, weak-willed action always involves a procedural rational
 defect:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 a technique of self-management has been deployed but has failed
(McIntyre 2006, p. 296). This fact alone gives us grounds to criticize
the action in virtue of the <em>second</em> feature which (for Holton)
distinguishes weakness of will from mere change of mind. In cases like
these we needn&rsquo;t resolve the potentially murky issue of whether
the agent was <em>reasonable</em> in abandoning her intention.</p>

<p>
McIntyre maintains that it would be overstating the case to say that
because weakness of will involves this procedural defect, it is always
irrational (McIntyre 2006, p. 290; pp. 298&ndash;9; p. 302). She
proposes rather that practical rationality has multiple facets and
aims, and that failure in one respect or along one dimension does not
automatically justify the especially severe form of rational criticism
which we intend by the term &ldquo;irrational.&rdquo; For example,
consider an agent who succumbs to contrary inclination of exactly the
type expected when the time comes to act on a truly <em>stupid</em>
resolution. (Holton gives the example of resolving to go without water
for two days just to see what it feels like: Holton 2003, p. 42.)
There will indeed be a blemish on this agent&rsquo;s rational
scorecard if he eventually gives in and drinks: he will have failed in
his attempt at self-management. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be rationally
far <em>worse</em> for him to stick to his silly resolution no matter
what the cost?</p>

<p>
We can also re-examine the issue of the rationality of
<em>akrasia</em> in light of this analysis of weakness of will; for we
can distinguish between akratic and non-akratic cases of the latter.
As McIntyre points out, resolutions typically rest on judgments about
what it is best that one do at a (future) time <em>t</em>. If an agent
fails to act on a previously formed resolution to do <em>a</em> at
<em>t</em>, thus exhibiting weakness of will, we can distinguish the
case in which he still endorses at <em>t</em> the judgment that it is
best that he do <em>a</em> at <em>t</em> (even though he does not do
it) from the case in which he abandons that judgment along with his
resolution. In the latter, non-akratic case, the agent in effect
rationalizes his failure to live up to his resolution by deciding that
it is not after all best that he do <em>a</em> at <em>t</em>. McIntyre
points out that the traditional view that <em>akrasia</em> is always
irrational seems to give us a perverse incentive to rationalize, since
in that case we escape the grave charge of practical irrationality,
being left only with the procedural practical defect present in all
cases of weakness of will (McIntyre 2006, p. 291). But this seems
implausible: are the two sub-cases really so radically different in
their rational status? Indeed, McIntyre argues, if anything, akratic
weakness of will is typically rationally <em>preferable</em> to
rationalizing weakness of will (McIntyre 2006, p. 287; pp. 309ff.).
&ldquo;In the presence of powerful contrary inclinations that bring
about a failure to be resolute,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;resisting
rationalization and remaining clearheaded about one&rsquo;s reasons to
act can constitute a modest accomplishment&rdquo; (McIntyre 2006, p.
311). Have we witnessed the transformation of <em>akrasia</em> from
impossible, to irrational, to downright admirable?</p>

<p>
Tamar Schapiro (Schapiro 2021, 2022) departs in a very different way
from the tradition of understanding weakness of will as action
contrary to the agent&rsquo;s better judgment. Schapiro thinks it
misdiagnoses and understates the defect in weak-willed action to see
it as the product of a &ldquo;mistake within practical
deliberation&rdquo; (Schapiro 2021, p. 152). The problem is more
fundamental: weak-willed action is better characterized as
&ldquo;abandon[ing] your post as deliberator&rdquo; (Schapiro 2021, p.
152) than as making an error in deliberation. Weak-willed action in
fact does not actually engage the <em>will</em> at all. On
Schapiro&rsquo;s dualistic Kantian moral psychology,
<em>inclination</em> is a kind of &ldquo;feeling like it&rdquo; which
affects what she calls your &ldquo;inner animal,&rdquo; an instinctive
subagential part of you which perceives the world as teleologically
laden. An inclination creates motivational pressure and engages your
instinctive agential capacities even before you, the deciding agent,
have weighed in. As an agent with a free will, it falls to you to
treat that inclination as raw material for the construction of ends
and principles which you can take responsibility for. That is the
proper work of the will. However, inclination always places your will
&ldquo;at a crossroads&rdquo; (Schapiro quotes Kant&rsquo;s
<em>Groundwork</em>), because there is another alternative. You might
instead abdicate your responsibility to <em>decide</em> what to do and
&ldquo;flee the burden of your freedom.&rdquo; To &ldquo;take the low
road&rdquo; in this way is not to act on a faulty or inferior
principle; it is not to act on a principle at all, indeed arguably not
to act at all. When we take the low road, we flee into our animality,
seeking refuge, as it were, in our inner animal and allowing ourselves
to act <em>as if</em> we were nothing more than our inner animal. This
always constitutes bad faith, however, because we can never actually
<em>be</em> only our inner animal. The burden of our freedom is
inescapable.</p>

<h3 id="BroaDisc">3.4 Broadening the Discussion</h3>

<p>
Recent work on weakness of will has expanded the scope of discussion
in several respects, three of which we discuss below. Another
important development has been the application of weakness of will to
<em>groups</em>: see Pettit 2003, List and Pettit 2011, and Flowerman
2024.</p>

<h4>3.4.1 Epistemic <em>Akrasia</em></h4>

<p>
It is natural to ask whether there could be an <em>epistemic</em>
version of the phenomenon of <em>akrasia</em>. In an influential
discussion, Sophie Horowitz suggests that practical <em>akrasia</em>
does indeed have an epistemic counterpart: &ldquo;Just as an akratic
agent acts in a way she believes she ought not act, an epistemically
akratic agent believes something that she believes is unsupported by
her evidence&rdquo; (Horowitz 2014, p. 718). That is, the latter holds
a belief of the form &ldquo;<em>p</em>, but my evidence doesn&rsquo;t
support <em>p</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Is epistemic <em>akrasia</em> really possible, though? Some
philosophers who are happy to countenance practical <em>akrasia</em>
have answered in the negative: see for instance Hurley 1989, Owens
2002, and Adler 2002. David Owens (2002) argues that we lack the sort
of doxastic control that would be required in order for our beliefs to
be formed freely and deliberately. But epistemic <em>akrasia</em>
would require control of just that kind, he suggests. Jonathan Adler
(2002) makes a different argument for the impossibility of epistemic
<em>akrasia</em>. Adler notes what he takes to be an important
disanalogy between epistemic and practical reasoning. Conflict between
two <em>beliefs</em> that can&rsquo;t both be <em>true</em> must
weaken one or both beliefs; but conflict between two <em>desires</em>
that can&rsquo;t both be <em>satisfied</em> need not weaken either
desire. So it is perfectly possible that a practically akratic agent
who has formed an all-things-considered judgment about what to do may
still be in the grip of a desire to do something else. However, Adler
thinks this can&rsquo;t happen in the doxastic realm: one can&rsquo;t
remain in the grip of a <em>belief</em> if one views the evidence for
an opposing belief as decisive. (See Levy 2004 and Ribeiro 2011 for
counterarguments to Adler.)</p>

<p>
If there could indeed be an epistemic version of <em>akrasia</em>, it
is worth considering how closely it would parallel practical
<em>akrasia</em>, including the purported irrationality of the latter.
Daniel Greco (2014) underlines that practical and epistemic varieties
of <em>akrasia</em> have in common that they involve a kind of
fragmentation or inner conflict. This supports the idea that both
epistemic and practical <em>akrasia</em> are irrational. (See also
Feldman 2005.) But just as the rational status of practical
<em>akrasia</em> has become contested (see section 3.2 above), some
theorists (for example Coates (2012), Christensen (2024),
Lasonen-Aarnio (2014), Sinhababu (2020), Weatherson (2019), and
Wedgwood (2011)) have argued that epistemic <em>akrasia</em> could
potentially be rational as well. This discussion has been shaped by a
growing interest in higher-order evidence &mdash; that is, evidence
that bears on what one&rsquo;s first-order evidence actually supports.
Defenders of the rationality of epistemic <em>akrasia</em> have argued
that beliefs of the form &ldquo;<em>p</em>, but my evidence
doesn&rsquo;t support <em>p</em>&rdquo; can be rationally permissible
when one has <em>misleading</em> higher-order evidence. In such cases,
they contend, a person could have good grounds both for believing that
<em>p</em> and for believing that her evidence doesn&rsquo;t support
the conclusion that <em>p</em>. Horowitz (2014, p. 740), on the other
hand, maintains that beliefs of this form are rationally unstable.</p>

<p>
Theorists have also appealed to epistemic <em>akrasia</em> to advance
or defend other positions in epistemology. Jamie Fritz (2021) uses it,
for instance, in an argument for epistemic impurism: the view that
&ldquo;[s]ome paradigmatically epistemic properties of a belief that
<em>p</em> (like whether <em>p</em> is epistemically rational, or
whether it is knowledge) depend on factors that are not relevant to
the truth of <em>p&rdquo;</em> (Fritz 2021, p. 98). Fritz thinks
epistemic <em>purists</em> are committed to the possibility of
rational epistemic <em>akrasia</em>, which he takes to be a
<em>reductio</em>. Others have drawn a variety of conclusions about
<em>credences</em>&mdash;degrees of belief&mdash;by appealing to
epistemic <em>akrasia</em>: see Jackson and Tan 2021, Lin 2021, and
Fraser 2022.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Interdisciplinary Approaches to Understanding the Will and its Weakness</h4>

<p>
Philosophers have increasingly engaged with empirical literature about
the nature of willpower and how this notion is understood in ordinary
life. Part of this literature is concerned to distinguish willpower
from potentially related notions such as self-control,
self-regulation, and resisting temptation. For example, studies by
Irving et al. (2022) and Berm&uacute;dez et al. (2023) suggest that
the folk psychological understanding of self-control centers
synchronic strategies for resisting temptation. However, empirical
evidence suggests that diachronic regulation and external scaffolding
may be more effective at helping agents manage motivational conflict
over time (see Duckworth et al. 2016, Soravia et al 2015, and Wagner
et al. 2004). Indeed, it is possible that those who most effectively
resist temptation are those who have cultivated habits so that
temptation rarely arises for them in first place. Haug (2021, pp.
303&ndash;306) uses empirical evidence to suggest that individuals who
are regarded as highly self-controlled experience a kind of
motivational harmony, the result of indirect attentional strategies
which inhibit conflicting desires from rising to the level at which
they must be resisted. It thus lies between what Aristotle would have
described as continence and temperance. (See Orlandi and Stroud 2021
for a philosophical treatment.) There has also been discussion of how
philosophical understandings of <em>akrasia</em> might be related to
dual-process models of reasoning in psychology (see, e.g., Altehenger
2021<em>a</em>).</p>

<p>
On the question of whether exercises of willpower or self-control must
be effortful, the older &ldquo;ego depletion&rdquo; model of willpower
has increasingly come under question in recent years. (See for
instance Dang and Hagger 2019.) Mylopoulos and Pacherie (2020),
Berm&uacute;dez et al. (2024), and Berm&uacute;dez (2021) instead
characterize self-control as a kind of skill or a set of skills, the
exercise of which need not be effortful.</p>

<p>
George Ainslie has also addressed the question of whether willpower
takes effort. Ainslie has argued in an influential body of work (see
Ainslie 1992, 2001) that a pervasive tendency toward &ldquo;hyperbolic
delay discounting&rdquo; leads us to prefer smaller, sooner rewards
over larger, later ones. We can counter this tendency by engaging in
&ldquo;intertemporal bargaining,&rdquo; in which we &ldquo;recursively
self-predict&rdquo; what we will do in the future in light of our
choice today and create personal rules about which choices will count
as according with our values and which will constitute lapses. Ainslie
proposes models for this process that draw on behavioral economics,
social psychology, and brain imaging. In a recent target article
(Ainslie 2021), Ainslie argues that willpower should be identified
with a form of <em>resolve</em> understood along the above lines; he
distinguishes this attribute from impulse suppression and from habit.
The article is accompanied by numerous responses by critics.</p>

<h4>3.4.3 Understanding Psychological Difficulties through the Lens of <em>Akrasia</em></h4>

<p>
Could certain clinical psychopathological conditions that interfere
with practical reasoning be fruitfully understood in terms of
<em>akrasia</em>? Kampa (2020) maintains that the empirical evidence
shows obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to constitute a kind of
epistemic <em>akrasia</em>. He suggests that we can learn about
doxastic attitude-formation generally from research into the nature
and treatment of OCD (Kampa 2020, p. 489). August Gorman (2019) argues
that we can gain insights into the relations between <em>akrasia,</em>
compulsion, and attributability by considering agents with Tourette
syndrome, misophonia, and addiction. Gorman&rsquo;s account takes off
from a phenomenon first identified by Gary Watson. Normally, when we
are acting on our desires, we are trying to <em>satisfy</em> those
desires, not just <em>eliminate</em> them. By contrast, when an agent
acts compulsively, they act merely to eliminate the desire, not to
satisfy it (Watson 1975, p. 20, Gorman 2019, p. 140). However, actions
that we perform merely to extinguish or eliminate a desire seem not to
be attributable to us in the usual way. (For more on how Gorman
distinguishes weakness of will from compulsion, see Gorman 2023.)
Though people with Tourette syndrome, misophonia, and addiction may
experience desires that feel a lot like &ldquo;neurological
noise,&rdquo; Gorman argues that things are not black and white as to
whether ignoring or acting on that &ldquo;noise&rdquo; can be
attributed to them. This marks an important contrast between
Gorman&rsquo;s view and more traditional views of attributability such
as Deep Self views, according to which we cannot be attributable for
an action if we are alienated from the motivation for it.</p>

<p>
Recognizing the moral complexity of cases of <em>akrasia</em> has led
some philosophers to consider them in discussions about the nature of
blame (see Hartford 2020). There seem to be differences in
blameworthiness among akratic wrongdoers: contrast those who later
recognize that they acted wrongly with those who are aware of but
indifferent to the wrongfulness of their actions and those who are
ignorant that what they have done is wrong. Variation in our judgments
about whether agents are responsible for various akratic actions have
also been used in order to characterize addiction and other forms of
psychopathology.</p>

<p>
In particular, there has been growing interest in the question of
whether addiction might be best understood as a form of
<em>akrasia</em>. Building on the arguments of Mele (2002), Nick
Heather (2016) contends that addiction shares the core features of
akratic action and should be understood as a special kind of
<em>akrasia</em>, one in which agents consistently act against both
their present judgments and their prior resolutions (Heather 2016, pp.
133&ndash;4). Heather thus accepts Holton&rsquo;s (1999) distinction
between <em>akrasia</em> and weakness of will, but argues that
addiction paradigmatically involves both halves of this
distinction.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Edmund Henden (2016) argues on phenomenological
grounds that addiction should not be assimilated to weakness of will.
Addiction often involves habitual behavior, and addicts may continue
to take drugs even when they don&rsquo;t find it pleasurable to do so.
(For discussion of habitual weak-willed action from a different
perspective, see Silver 2019.) Henden contends that in these respects
addiction is profoundly unlike giving into temptation, as paradigm
examples of <em>akrasia</em> are often described. Moreover, Henden
notes that weakness of will seems rationally criticizable in a way
that addiction does not, suggesting that they can&rsquo;t be the same
phenomenon. Addicts do not lack strength of will: many sincerely try
very hard to abstain from using drugs, putting in a level of effort
that would normally suffice for success at a task. Federico Burdman
(2023) uses the case of addiction to remind us of an important lesson
about self-control which we flagged in the previous section,
underlining that we need an inclusive conception of self-control which
recognizes the significance of external scaffolding and other
community-based strategies for helping us manage motivational conflict
and stick to our resolutions.</p>
