<h1>Paradox of Tragedy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jan 13, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
David Hume famously remarked on a curious response we have to certain
works of art that cause us to feel unhappiness or distress:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It seems an unaccountable pleasure, which the spectators of a
well-written tragedy receive from sorrow, terror, anxiety, and other
passions, that are in themselves disagreeable and uneasy. The more
they are touched and affected, the more are they delighted with the
spectacle; and as soon as the uneasy passions cease to operate, the
piece is at an end. (1757 [1987: 216])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This odd connection between the simultaneous pleasure and distress
caused by tragic drama is remarked upon in Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Poetics</em>, the earliest philosophical attempt in the West to
construct an aesthetic theory. The problem also features in later
thinkers such as Burke (1757), Kant (1798; 7:241 [1996: 232]), Batteux
(1746 [2015: 48]), Schopenhauer (1818; 1844: ch. 37), and Nietzsche
(1886: 229; Price, 1998), but the framing of the contemporary focus on
the problem is mainly inherited from Hume. After a preliminary attempt
in
 <a href="#StatPara">Section 1</a>
 to precisely state the paradox, we will turn to various kinds of
solutions in
 <a href="#CompSolu">Sections 2 to 6</a>.</p>

<h2 id="StatPara">1. Statement of the Paradox</h2>

<p>
At first glance, it shouldn&rsquo;t be puzzling that works of art can
elicit both pleasure and pain, for that conjunction arises in a wide
range of ordinary non-aesthetic contexts. Frozen fingers, e.g., often
come with playing in the snow. Hume&rsquo;s enigma is that in certain
artistic engagements our pleasure seems to be internally related to
our distress. Pain is not merely a regrettable feature of the
experience, the elimination of which, insofar as the pleasure
remained, would be favored (Neill 1992: 153). Rather, for Hume, one
would not derive certain characteristic pleasures from tragic dramas
if they did not provoke their characteristic kinds of negative
emotions <em>qua</em> negative emotions. It is the experience of
negative emotions, not something that happens to cause or be caused by
their elicitation, that matters for our pleasure. As he notes,
audiences are &ldquo;pleased in proportion as they are
afflicted&rdquo; (1757 [1987: 217]). Although we will refer to this
conundrum as <em>the paradox of tragedy</em>, the condition it
describes is instantiated in many different modes of artistic
experience beyond the theater.</p>

<p>
Thus, on the one hand, we often pursue and take pleasure in works of
art in ways that are ostensibly explained by their elicitation of
disagreeable feelings: fear of a movie&rsquo;s monster, disgust over
the simulated viscera in a painting, shock in playing a video game,
cringing embarrassment for a television comedy&rsquo;s heedless
characters, alienation through punk rock, grief in listening to a
threnody, disorientation entering into an installation, trauma in
witnessing certain modes of performance art, and even boredom or
acedia that, for example, are intentionally elicited in Andy
Warhol&rsquo;s eight-hour continuous footage of the Empire State
Building filmed from a static point of view (Gilmore 2020:
157&ndash;158). On the other hand, such engagements do not conform to
the <em>prima facie</em> plausible assumption that we tend not to
pursue experiences for the distress, pain, annoyance, or other
aversive feelings they engender, and that when we must undergo such
experiences we do not positively value or take pleasure in those
disagreeable dimensions. Indeed, it might be proposed to be an
analytic truth that we don&rsquo;t take pleasure in something in
virtue of what makes it displeasing to us.</p>

<p>
Before we consider alternative construals of the paradox, it is
important to register that at least in Hume&rsquo;s version the pains
and pleasures of these kinds of artistic experiences aren&rsquo;t
easily accommodated in a <em>pro tanto</em> fashion. It seems right to
say that in an ordinary case such as playing in the snow, we take
pleasure in the experience <em>insofar as</em> it is diverting, an
opportunity to be with friends, etc. and we feel discomfort in the
experience <em>insofar as</em> our fingers begin to freeze and we
shiver. No paradox would arise in our experience of tragic drama from
its eliciting painful and pleasurable emotions that, analogously, are
directed at respectively different objects (Ridley 2003). Some
descriptions of the phenomenon thus eliminate its paradoxical air by
identifying the distinct objects of pain and pleasure that have been
unwittingly treated as one. By contrast, in Hume&rsquo;s version of
the puzzle, we do not disvalue tragedy insofar as it causes us pain
and value it insofar as it gives us pleasure. Rather, the pain or
distress a tragedy elicits seems itself positively valued
(&ldquo;unaccountably&rdquo; so [1757: first line]). Further, that
pain and pleasure seem to directly covary: at least within a
restricted range, an increase in the former brings an increase in the
latter.</p>

<p>
Of course, mere covariance of pain and pleasure in some experience
doesn&rsquo;t always pose a conundrum. Suppose that as it gets colder,
the quality of the snow in which children play improves. There, the
pleasure of throwing snowballs and the pain of frozen digits bear a
direct relationship, but only because they share a common condition or
cause. Here, if the pain could be diminished without a loss in
pleasure, that would be something participants desire. By contrast,
Hume&rsquo;s enigma is that we seem to want to suffer: we undergo some
sort of positive emotion that is explained by our distress, not just
by the circumstances by which the distress is caused. It is that
dynamic that would make it odd to agree with the &ldquo;Positive Opera
Company&rdquo;, in an April Fools Day parody aired on National Public
Radio, that audiences are better off when tragic operas such as
<em>Don Giovanni</em> and <em>La Boh&egrave;me</em> are rewritten to
provide happy endings (broadcast 1 April 2006). Or, in a genuine
example, it would be a dubious claim that audiences have reason to
prefer Nahum Tate&rsquo;s 1681 version of <em>King Lear</em> over
Shakespeare&rsquo;s insofar as the revision eliminates the destruction
of Lear and Cordelia that makes the original so distressing.</p>

<p>
As we will see, the cases we wish to understand are highly variable:
they, and the responses they elicit, may not fall into any natural
class (Neill 1999: 124). Furthermore, one may wish to abjure
references to <em>pain</em> and other constitutively embodied
responses in contexts in which the distress is primarily constituted
by psychological not somatic states (for a common concept of pain, see
Raja et al. 2020). And to say that we <em>suffer</em> from a voluntary
diversion such as attending the theater or streaming a film on tv can
sound rather grandiose, at least when compared to real suffering
people undergo in relation to non-imagined states of affairs. Allowing
for those cavils, we can offer at least a preliminary attempt at a
general characterization of the paradox, by saying that an experience
has a negative affective <em>valence</em> in part or whole if it is
one in which we feel pain or some other disagreeable emotion or
feeling. And an experience has a positive affective valence if it is
one in part or whole in which we feel pleasure or some agreeable
emotion or feeling. The paradox can thus be stated as the conjunction
of three individually plausible but jointly inconsistent
propositions.</p>

<p>
For some instance or form of art <em>A</em>:</p>

<ol>

<li>Properly appreciating <em>A</em> involves forming a mental state
with a negative valence (<em>Appreciation Condition</em>)</li>

<li>We do not take pleasure in forming a mental state with a negative
valence (<em>Coordination Condition</em>)</li>

<li>We take pleasure in properly appreciating <em>A</em> (<em>Response
Condition</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although conditions 1&ndash;3 capture the structure of the puzzle, we
should note that in the gloss on the paradox earlier, it was natural
to refer to different kinds of attitudes being implicated beyond that
of taking pleasure, viz, <em>desiring</em> and <em>valuing</em>. This
reflects that there may be different formulations of the paradox
employing reference to different attitudes&mdash;affective, conative,
evaluative&mdash;which are taken to be central and in need of
explanation.</p>

<p>
Thus, the Appreciation Condition may be that a proper appreciation of
<em>A</em> elicits</p>

<ul>

<li>a displeasing experience; or,</li>

<li>a negative appraisal of the experience; or,</li>

<li>a desire that the experience not occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And the Response Condition may be that a proper appreciation of
<em>A</em> furnishes</p>

<ul>

<li>a pleasurable experience; or,</li>

<li>a positive appraisal of the experience; or</li>

<li>a desire that the experience occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Different formulations of the paradox may mix and match those
different kinds of attitudes (e.g., pairing the unpleasantness of the
experience with the desire that it occur). Yet, not all such
conjunctions necessarily evince a puzzling conflict. In other words,
not all such pairings lend themselves to a plausible statement of the
Coordination Condition. For example, as those with substance
addictions would avow, <em>to desire</em> does not entail <em>to
positively appraise</em>, and so a worrying over whether there is a
consistency between those attitudes of those different <em>kinds</em>,
when expressed about any particular thing, can sometimes be
otiose.</p>

<p>
Even when we restrict the operative attitude to one kind (whether
emotions, desires, or appraisals) two such attitudes toward the same
object can coherently disagree, as we saw above, in virtue of being
<em>pro tanto</em>, or directed at the object from a different
perspective. Taking pleasure in one&rsquo;s child leaving for college
isn&rsquo;t inconsistent with feeling sadness over her departure from
home. Mixed emotions and incompatible desires are a common feature of
affective experience (Greenspan 1980; Larsen &amp; McGraw 2014). Note,
however, it would be too quick to assume any pairing of attitudes that
belong to different kinds is thereby rationally benign; for that would
prejudge the question of whether a given attitude-kind imposes
rational or psychological constraints on another. Some philosophers
argue, for example, that a desire for <em>x</em> presents <em>x</em>
as valuable or &ldquo;good&rdquo; (e.g., Stampe 1987). Some
psychological theories of the emotions construe at least some of them
as expressions of desires (Green 1992; Gordon 1987). And, finally,
emotions themselves have characteristic somatic, cognitive,
expressive, behavioral, and phenomenological dimensions that can make
particular emotional pairings psychologically and physically difficult
to sustain (Cowen &amp; Keltner 2017).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the statements of the paradox carry an implicit
assumption that negative and positive valences exist on a single
continuum, such that the more <em>positively</em> valenced an
experience is, the less <em>negatively</em> valenced it must be. But
there are empirical reasons to suspect that this relation does not
hold, at least in the case of the valence of pleasure. Rather, some
work in the psychology of affective experience suggests that the two
measures are orthogonal to one another (Norris et al. 2010). If this
is so, it would render the co-presence of the two responses less
curious. But it would then raise the question of why, if Hume is
right, the two independent responses seem to covary (assuming there is
no common cause)&mdash;&ldquo;The more they are touched and affected,
the more are they delighted with the spectacle&rdquo; (1757 [1987:
216]).</p>

<p>
Finally, a distinction elided in the above pairings is that between
construing the paradox in descriptive and normative terms.
Descriptively, the problem rests on the assumption that as an
empirical matter we usually <em>do not</em> take pleasure in pain, but
with tragic art forms we do. Normatively, the problem rests on the
assumption that we <em>ought not</em> to take pleasure in pain, but
with some of the arts, a successful appreciation means we should. As
we will see, the descriptive construal is threatened by the wide
variety of contexts in which indeed we do seem to take pleasure in
pain. Meanwhile, the normative construal is threatened by the
difficulty in providing a convincing interpretation of that
&ldquo;ought&rdquo;. Is pursuing painful experiences or garnering
pleasure from pain practically irrational; a failure of fit or aptness
of our emotions for their objects (i.e., where the formal object of
pleasure isn&rsquo;t something that causes pain); defective with
respect to the evolved function of pain (as a signal of current or
immanent injury and elicitor of avoidance behavior); a misconstrual of
the objective value of the relevant artistic experiences; or perhaps
in some other way unmerited or dysfunctional? Augustine calls that
pleasure in grief that we experience while watching tragic drama a
&ldquo;wretched madness&rdquo; (<em>Confessions</em> Book 3, chapter
II) but why it is irrational or &ldquo;mad&rdquo; to have that
experience is not explained.</p>

<p>
In what follows, we will focus on the paradox of tragedy construed
solely in descriptive terms, and, for economy&rsquo;s sake, confine
our attention to solutions that see the paradox in Hume&rsquo;s terms,
as, at least <em>prima facie</em>, involving a puzzling mixture of
painful and pleasurable emotions. For a version of the paradox
construed solely in terms of desires, see Currie (2010). The following
draws partly from the typology of solutions outlined in Levinson
(2014b: xii).</p>

<h2 id="CompSolu">2. Compensatory Solutions</h2>

<p>
One major approach to the paradox introduces reasons for why, despite
what appears to be our usual disposition to avoid pain and distress,
we may be rationally motivated to pursue experiences of art that
elicit disagreeable feelings. Such <em>compensatory</em> approaches
thus acknowledge the negative valence and undesirability of the
feelings we have while experiencing tragedies (and relevantly similar
art forms), but contend that we choose to undergo those feelings for
the sake of realizing some sufficiently valuable good. Here, the
disagreeable dimension of an artistic experience is not positively
estimated qua disagreeable dimension, but only for its contribution to
some specifiable benefit. Compensatory solutions might initially seem
to dissolve even the <em>appearance</em> of a paradox, as it is hardly
surprising to note that pain is sometimes the price we pay for
pleasure. Yet, we don&rsquo;t speak of, e.g., the &ldquo;paradox of
dentistry&rdquo;. How is tragedy, and other painful art, different?
Compensatory solutions tend to answer through highlighting ways in
which the benefits of such art forms are in principle not realizable
independently of our undergoing their characteristic modes of causing
distress.</p>

<h3 id="HedoComp">2.1 Hedonic Compensation</h3>

<p>
One such benefit that could render the experience of disagreeable
dimensions of an art form worthwhile is aesthetic pleasure. Thus a
common approach, motivated by Hume&rsquo;s essay, is that we suffer in
response to the <em>content</em> of the tragic representation but feel
pleasure in response to its <em>formal</em> features (Yanal 1991: 76;
Eaton 1989). The thought behind such <em>hedonic compensatory
theories</em> is that I feel pain in imaginatively representing the
contents of a play, but pleasure in such things as the play&rsquo;s
plot, language, scenery, costuming, and the actors&rsquo;
performances. That pleasure is provided in a sufficient quantity or
degree to justify undergoing that pain. This solution thus treats the
proper appreciation of a work of art as comprised of two distinct
affective experiences, each with its own object: the represented
content, and the medium or mode of representation. Our experience of
that content&mdash;e.g., through imagining that the represented state
of affairs is real&mdash;is posited to cause us pain. At the same
time, our experience of the work&rsquo;s medium or mode of
representation&mdash;e.g., through seeing its beauty or evaluating its
plot&mdash;is said to give us pleasure. Thus, noting the pleasure
elicited by a painter&rsquo;s achievement of verisimilitude, Aristotle
remarks that &ldquo;objects which in themselves we view with pain, we
delight to contemplate when reproduced with minute fidelity&rdquo;
(Poetics IV). Although intuitively compelling, the problem with this
approach is that it is exceedingly difficult to speak of our
experience of form or content as separable from the other in a way
that is consistent with artistic appreciation.</p>

<p>
Let us take a literary fiction as an illustration. In principle we can
refer solely to aspects of its content&mdash;what is fictionally true
in the work, or how it represents the world as being. And, in
principle, we can refer solely to aspects of its form&mdash;calling
attention to its tone, verbal style, names of characters, plot
structure, and so on. However, even a minimal experience of the
work&rsquo;s content will be inflected by the work&rsquo;s form. This
is so because the contents of a literary fiction are in part
constituted by <em>how</em> they are represented. Thus, for example,
Peter Lamarque (2007: 121; 2014) notes that the features of
shallowness and ostentation that Dickens invokes in the name of the
Veneerings in <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>, are intrinsic qualities of
those characters themselves. Here, one&rsquo;s experience of the
work&rsquo;s content (the fictional characters) is inflected by the
work&rsquo;s form (their names and the tone in which they are
described). Of course, the text of, specifically, a tragic drama
exists prior to the play being performed. However, even there we can
speak of the represented content of the performance as inflected by
its form, as we compare, e.g., one actor&rsquo;s Hamlet to another, or
the staging of the play in traditional dress versus contemporary
clothes. The mistake is to assume that form and content refer to two
distinct <em>experiences</em> of the object of our appreciation. But
there is only one experience of the work of art: the experience of the
<em>content-given-form.</em></p>

<p>
A proponent of the view in question might then respond that what
causes our pleasure is not merely the form of tragedy but its
content-as-represented. We don&rsquo;t take pleasure in the mere
content: e.g., that Lear holds the murdered Cordelia, we take pleasure
in the particular way in which the play (actors, staging, etc.)
represents that event. But if such content-given-form is supposed to
explain our pleasure, then what explains our distress? It cannot be
the content itself, because we have no access to content, except as it
is inflected by a given form. Similar problems beset attempts to treat
the different objects of our pain and pleasure as, respectively, the
sad content of tragedy and its <em>artistry</em>, for any full
description of the artistry of a work would require reference to what
that content is&mdash;what events and states of affairs are
represented by the work. At best, one could say that certain formal
features of a tragedy offer pleasure in themselves, independent of
their role in being constituents of the manner by which the
tragedy&rsquo;s content is represented. Aspects of lighting, costume,
stage sets, music, movement, voice, etc., might be pleasurable in
themselves, perhaps thereby compensating for displeasure caused by a
plot. Yet, this approach leaves open the following question: why do
audiences often prefer to attend tragic dramas over alternative
theatrical productions with none of the tragedy&rsquo;s
distress-inducing contents? Comedies are not always chosen over
tragedies even if they offer the same formal rewards. We&rsquo;ll
return to that question below, after considering some other versions
of and objections to the compensatory pleasures account.</p>

<p>
Note, it is an independent question whether the distinction between
form and content as the respective targets of our feelings might
explain the puzzle of why people seem to take pleasure in the
<em>non-fictional</em> contents of a representation of awful events,
for there the events are not constituted by how they are represented.
Sometimes the distress caused by thinking of the events under one
description can be counterposed against the pleasure caused by
thinking of them under another description, where different framings
impose different patterns of saliencies on the shared content. One
might take pleasure in a historical account of a medieval method of
torture that highlights its bizarre and outlandish brutality but be
discomfited by an account that makes vivid the excruciating suffering
of its victim. By contrast, tragic dramas typically don&rsquo;t
license alternative points of view from which, respectively, their
contents elicit pleasure and distress.</p>

<p>
Some critics of compensatory theories centered on pleasure dispute the
phenomenology such theories impute to the experience of painful art.
Specifically, they dispute the very claim that people feel pleasure in
experiencing such works. Rather, they note, people often describe
their engagements with tragic dramas and the like as, &ldquo;on the
whole, painful, distressing, gut-wrenching, and emotionally
devastating, not as on balance pleasurable&rdquo; (Smuts 2014: 124;
see also Andrade &amp; Cohen 2007).</p>

<p>
In response, a defender of a hedonic compensatory view might propose
that such reports should not be taken at face value. For a natural
response to believing or perceiving a tragic event has occurred would
be to feel sympathy for its victim; for their suffering to linger on
in one&rsquo;s mind; to recall the event with sadness. But such
reactions do not typically accompany merely imagining that such an
event occurred. If our putative expressions of pity for a fictional
character don&rsquo;t have the behavioral profile of feeling pity for
actual people, perhaps we don&rsquo;t suffer for them the way we think
we do.</p>

<h3 id="HedoMetaResp">2.2 Hedonic Meta-Response</h3>

<p>
The <em>hedonic meta-response</em> theory offers a different critique
of hedonic compensatory theories: that their defect is not in their
appeal to pleasure <em>per se</em>, but where they locate it in our
engagements with distressing works. The claim here is that we
don&rsquo;t feel pleasure in the first-order experience of a tragic or
distressing work, but rather feel that pleasure as part of a
second-order to that first-order response. Here, pain is necessary for
pleasure because the pleasure is given in a meta-response to the pain.
Thus, Rafael De Clercq (2014), for example, notes the pleasure we may
take <em>in recognizing that a work is such as to evoke</em>, or has
evoked, a negatively-valenced emotion, even if we don&rsquo;t take
pleasure in experiencing that emotion. For empirical studies
supporting that relation between first-order experience of aversive
experience, and pleasure in one&rsquo;s meta-cognitive response to the
experience, see Rozin and others (2013).</p>

<p>
Why might audiences feel pleasure as part of such a meta-response? One
proposal is that the experience makes salient one&rsquo;s humanity;
that one shares with all others a susceptibility to feelings of
sadness, loneliness, fear, and the like (Levinson 1982; Feagin 1983).
Another is that we may take pleasure in recognizing the work&rsquo;s
achievement in having elicited those emotions in us. A third is that
our pleasure comes from having an opportunity to explore the nature of
our suffering, without the motivation to alleviate it given that it
isn&rsquo;t a genuine indication of the bad things that typically
accompany suffering in real life</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it becomes possible for us to savor the feeling for its special
character, since we are for once spared the additional distress that
accompanies its occurrence in the context of life. (Levinson 1982:
325)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A fourth proposal, advanced by Susan Feagin is that our pleasurable
meta-response consists in recognizing our virtue. Specifically, we
have a first-order painful response arising from our sympathy with or
pity for the victims of a tragic drama, and second-order response, in
which we take pleasure in recognizing how we felt in that first-order
response. Feagin writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We find ourselves to be the kind of people who respond negatively to
villainy, treachery, and injustice. This discovery, or reminder, is
something which, quite justly, yields satisfaction. (1983: 98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One worry about such accounts of pleasure that locate it in a
self-reflexive meta-response is that they seem to call into question
the genuineness of our concern for others that is part of the
first-order response. Because of its self-reflexivity, the pleasure we
take in having that concern seems to stem not from <em>being</em> the
kind of person who, e.g., feels pity and sympathy toward others, but
from <em>thinking of oneself</em> as virtuous in that way. Indeed,
choosing to attend a tragic drama for the sake of that pleasure casts
doubt on the sincerity of one&rsquo;s pity or sympathy for tragic
characters&mdash;for pity and sympathy are not emotions one chooses to
experience <em>for the sake of</em> some personal end. In his
<em>Lettre &agrave; d&rsquo;Alembert</em>, Rousseau proposes that, far
from nurturing in us a genuine capacity for sympathy outside aesthetic
contexts, the best tragedies only function to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
reduce all the duties of man to some passing and sterile emotions that
have no consequences, [except] to make us applaud &hellip; our
humanity in pitying the ills that we could have cured. (1758 [1960:
25])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An alternative objection is that there are likely many people who lack
moral goodness but who respond with pity and sympathy to the fates of
tragic characters. Perhaps their experience shows that we would be
wrong to infer from our feeling pleasure in recognizing our pity for
characters in a drama, to how we would feel for those in comparable
states of affairs in real life. In other words, while our
meta-response to our feelings for fictions might give us pleasure, we
would be unjustified in characterizing that meta-response as a
recognition of a genuine capacity for pity. Augustine disputes a
similar claim that our pleasure in tragedy derives from the feeling of
compassion we have for its protagonists. Such mercy would imply a
desire that the sorrows of characters be eliminated, yet, as he notes,
spectators desire that they be continued&mdash;taking pleasure in
one&rsquo;s own sadness, one &ldquo;sheds tears of joy&rdquo;
(<em>Confessions</em> Book 6).</p>

<p>
Another challenge, which we&rsquo;ll look at more closely below in the
discussion of the <em>distancing</em> approach, arises from a general
relation that theorists of fiction have proposed between the
absorption one experiences in engaging with a fiction and the degree
to which one experiences self-awareness or self-conscious attention to
one&rsquo;s experience. The proposal is that the relation is indirect:
the more one is self-conscious, the less one is absorbed, or
&ldquo;transported&rdquo; into a fiction, and the less one experiences
typical effects of fictions such as emotional engagement. The problem
this raises for the meta-response theory is that a meta-response
<em>calls for</em> such self-consciousness&mdash;hence for a
diminution in the absorption that is typically a precondition of
fiction-directed emotions. So the solution would seem to propose that
the very experience that gives us pleasure results in a weakening of
that pleasure&rsquo;s causal condition.</p>

<p>
Some plausible responses would be that our meta-response and
absorption are not constant but alternate, i.e., we flip back and
forth from attention to the contents of the story as if they were real
to our own response to the story in which it is explicitly
acknowledged as fictional. An alternative suggestion is that
absorption dominates the experience of the work but the pleasure in
meta-response to that experience takes hold once our engagement with
the story has concluded (e.g., when the play ends). The plausibility
of these solutions can be addressed in part by how well they
characterize the phenomenology of our experience of works such as
tragedies. The verdict here is unclear.</p>

<p>
In any case, it shouldn&rsquo;t be disputed that sometimes we feel
pleasure in virtue of a second order response to a first order
response. One might laugh over the excessive fear one felt during a
roller coaster ride, or one&rsquo;s nervousness before a big date.
Analogous relations can hold as one reflects on one&rsquo;s weeping
during a sad film, as one finds it curious how susceptible one is to
having emotions triggered by what one knows to be fictional, or how
automatic tendencies to feel and behave certain ways expose the faults
in one&rsquo;s dignified image of oneself as having top-down cognitive
control over such reactions.</p>

<p>
Other candidates for the hedonic return in enduring tragedy&rsquo;s
characteristic forms of distress include the pleasure of relief, once
the unfolding of the story that sustains the distress has reached an
end, and the pleasure of one&rsquo;s sense of one&rsquo;s comparative
wellbeing in not being subject to the misfortunes of an aversive
fiction&rsquo;s protagonists (Lear 1988). Lucretius identifies the
general dynamic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&rsquo;tis sweet
<br />
To mark what evils we ourselves be spared;
<br />
&rsquo;Tis sweet, again, to view the mighty strife
<br />
Of armies battled yonder o&rsquo;er the plains,
<br />
Ourselves no sharers in the peril. (<em>De rerum natura</em> Book II,
5&ndash; 9).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See Dadlez (2004: 222) for the potentially broad scope of Hume&rsquo;s
reference to pleasure, where it is associated with a wide variety of
distinct kinds of passions, including relief and hope.</p>

<h3 id="NonHedoComp">2.3 Non-Hedonic Compensation</h3>

<p>
Approaches that reject the exclusively hedonistic flavor of
compensatory theories note that some of the goods afforded by aversive
works of art can be sufficiently compensatory without being
pleasurable. More precisely, such theories allow that tragedy can
cause us to feel pleasure, but that is through offering us a distinct
kind of good, the possession of which is itself valuable, and not just
as a <em>source</em> of pleasure or satisfaction. Such theorists deny
the assumption of the <em>response condition</em>. Thus, Aaron Ridley
remarks,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is &hellip; no reason at all to imagine that the value and
importance of tragic drama must ultimately derive from its capacity to
please. And that, surely, is just as well, since successful tragic
drama&mdash;think of Lear, think of Oedipus&mdash;is simply not all
that pleasing. (2003: 413; see also Budd 1995)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>2.3.1 Heightened Experience</h4>

<p>
One candidate for a value distinct from pleasure is mere affective
stimulation. The thought here is that is we sometimes value
experiences that provoke us to strong feelings, extreme affective
states that may be valuable just because they are unusual in ordinary
humdrum life (which of course does not presume that any affective
state that is unusual is for that reason valuable).</p>

<p>
Hume (1757) considers L&rsquo;Abbe Dubos&rsquo;s argument for that
proposal that it is the mere desire for heightened experience, whether
positive or negative, that motivates us to be audiences for tragic
drama:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
No matter what the passion is: Let it be disagreeable, afflicting,
melancholy, disordered; it is still better than that insipid languor,
which arises from perfect tranquility and repose. (1757 [1987:
217])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
His objection, however, is that, as we saw earlier, our positive
affect in engaging with a tragic drama is a result of exposure to its
events-as-represented, not to the events themselves:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is certain, that the same object of distress, which pleases in a
tragedy, were it really set before us, would give the most unfeigned
uneasiness; though it be then the most effectual cure to languor and
indolence. (1757 [1987: 218])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A related proposal is that what we take pleasure in is not the extreme
state of fear, sadness, disgust, and so on, but an aspect of those
states that is not intrinsically unpleasant (Morreal 1985). Thus some
kinds of fear involve a feeling of excitement, and we may take
pleasure in that aspect of, e.g., riding a rollercoaster, without
being said to take pleasure in all aspects of the fear that event may
cause, such as a feeling of tightness in one&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<p>
Smuts (2007) argues for what he calls the <em>rich experience</em>
theory which holds that audiences desire such works in part for the
intrinsic value of the experiences they offer. These are experiences
one cannot typically undergo in ordinary life without paying serious
psychic or physical costs. By &ldquo;rich experience&rdquo; Smuts
means experiences that are &ldquo;cognitively, sensorily, and
affectively engaging&rdquo; (2014: 132). Here, the painful experience
is not, alone, valuable, so much as it is partly <em>constitutive</em>
of experiences that are valuable.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Cognitive Value</h4>

<p>
Other goods relate to the cognitive benefits, broadly understood, of
the experience of tragic drama. Thus, it has been proposed (most
famously in association with the obscure notion of
&ldquo;catharsis&rdquo;) that tragedies offer spectators an
opportunity to clarify their emotions. On interpretations of
Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of catharsis, see Nehamas (1994); on the
ambiguity of the concept, see K. Bennett (1981) and Lear (1988). The
proper understanding and existence of catharsis is controversial
(Shelley 2003). But a plausible construction of the idea is that we
come to learn about some of our emotions when their expression is
elicited by highly affecting works of art, in the case of tragedies
specifically by the &ldquo;release&rdquo; of the negative emotions of
fear and pity that comes with the narrative resolution of the plot.
There, the expression of our emotions does not leave them unchanged;
rather, they are exposed, fine-tuned, and given a salient form when
arising in conformity to a work of tragedy&rsquo;s prescriptions for
how to feel. For the view that emotions can be brought into
perspicuity through their expression, see Collingwood (1938:
109&ndash;11) and Gilmore (2011). Another cognitive benefit is an
intrinsically valuable enlightenment about the nature of suffering.
Flint Schier (1989) thus discusses how an artistic representation may
allow us a more objective understanding of such things as distress and
pain, and more broadly, the nature of our and other&rsquo;s human
predicament, than would our witnessing actual distress. For example,
in the case of an actual event, our concern for our own safety might
obscure our understanding of the depth and character of the suffering
of others. Schier argues that we desire such knowledge because it is
intrinsically valuable, and thus take pleasure in acquiring it (see
also Shelley 2003). Relatedly, Kames proposes that tragedy helps to
enhances our sympathy and (thereby) strengthens our virtues (1751:
Essay i, 49&ndash;50). Hutcheson, by contrast, notes the satisfaction
we take in morally approving the virtuous dispositions of characters
in a tragedy in response to the struggles they face (1725: ii, 6.7,
240&ndash;241).</p>

<p>
A third non-hedonic value is an opportunity afforded by tragic works
of art to contemplate and better come to understand our own
vulnerability to loss. Referring to the last point in his discussion
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies, Samuel Johnson writes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the reflection that strikes the heart is not, that the evils before us
are real evils, but that they are evils to which we ourselves may be
exposed. (1765: 77&ndash;78)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Other cognitive approaches suggest that the benefits offered by
painful emotions pertain to understanding the work of art itself.
Thus, Goodman (1968 [1976: 248&ndash;52]), treats both negative and
positive emotions as potential modes of sensitivity to a
work&mdash;helping discern properties of it that a colder
dispassionate appraisal would miss. Maybe there is a point conveyed by
a work to which we remain uncomprehending unless sufficiently attuned
to it via the focus on it engendered by being in a particular
emotional state.</p>

<p>
Relatedly, Korsmeyer (2011) endorses what she identifies as a
&ldquo;conversionary account&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#BroaApprPhen">Section 5</a>
 below). In her view, the disgust and fear we feel for some
representations are not transformed into different, pleasurable
emotions, but rather serve (are &ldquo;put to use&rdquo;) in the
attainment of aesthetically or otherwise valuable responses to that
representation (2011: 132). For example, disgust and fear elicited by
a representation can heighten <em>attentive absorption</em> (2011:
132) in that thing. And &ldquo;death&rdquo;, she writes, &ldquo;is
realized differently in the experience of disgust&rdquo; (2011: 134),
suggesting that there is epistemic value peculiar to an experience
that is realized through its elicitation of disfavored feelings.
Rather than demonstrating a conversion of negative feelings, this
account is better characterized as identifying a compensation that
they lead to, viz, the achievement of such things as attentive
absorption for which we undergo fear and disgust; or the realization
of an overall pleasurable whole, of which the negative emotions are
parts. See a related proposal in Todd (2014) that our awareness of a
fiction <em>qua</em> fiction shapes the negative emotions that its
contents elicit, and those negative emotions in turn strengthen and
focus our attention to those contents.</p>

<p>
A final candidate for a quasi-cognitive good is the satisfaction of
curiosity or achievement of understanding. The thought here is the
understanding gained in satisfying our curiosity is itself valuable
(cognitively so) and is pleasing to obtain. Indeed, just as the
pleasure of slaking one&rsquo;s thirst helps motivate the search for
life-sustaining hydration, the pleasure of achieving understanding is
part of what helps motivate our efforts to realize and garner its
intrinsic value. Aristotle notes in the <em>Poetics</em> that
&ldquo;we enjoy looking at the most exact portrayals of things whose
actual sight is painful to us&rdquo; (<em>Poetics</em> IV; he refers
to pictures of corpses as an example) and explains this pleasure as
arising from the knowledge acquired in viewing such representations.
See the more contemporary account by Carroll on the role of disgust in
horror films (1990: 184&ndash;5) where our pleasure is not in the
disgust itself but in the disclosure of the unknown&mdash;the
monster&mdash;of which disgust is a predictable concomitant.</p>

<p>
One concern with the cognitive account is whether the putative
cognitive benefits are sufficiently strong to compensate for the
displeasures of tragedy. If we learn something largely propositional
from tragic or other disturbing works of art, it isn&rsquo;t clear why
we tend to see them again and again. If learning such and such
explains why we endure the pain a tragedy causes, this wrongly
suggests that seeing the tragedy a second time somehow deprives it of
its compensatory value&mdash;since we already know what it teaches.
Perhaps a response is that we learn something more completely or
differently with subsequent viewings. Although this criticism is drawn
from generally applicable anti-cognitive approaches to the arts, it
takes on a special plausibility in the case of tragic drama which,
unlike, e.g., novels, we often see in several iterations.</p>

<p>
Another objection addresses an ambiguity faced by cognitive accounts
over whether the compensation tragedy offers is the value of
understanding, or merely the value of <em>having the feeling</em> of
gaining understanding. If, as some of the cognitive compensatory
approaches note, it isn&rsquo;t for the sake of the cognitive benefit,
but for the sake of the pleasures associated with those cognitive
benefits, that we submit ourselves to the unpleasant emotions of
tragedy, how important is it that those cognitive benefits be
genuine?</p>

<p>
Jonathan Lear (1988) identifies, for example, one of the goods of
tragedy as being the <em>consolation</em> it offers in explaining that
when bad things happen to good people, those occurrences are
intelligible and explicable: they do not &ldquo;occur in a world which
is in itself ultimately chaotic and meaningless&rdquo; (1988: 325).
Yet, as Aristotle observes, what is important in a well-formed tragedy
is that events <em>appear</em> plausible or credible, not that they
actually are (<em>Poetics</em> XXIV). The <em>appearance of
explaining</em> this consoling fact takes precedence over actually
imparting knowledge of how the world works, at least in
Aristotle&rsquo;s estimation of what best generates artistic value.
Perhaps what matters is not that we learn from tragedy, but that we
have the satisfying feeling of having learned. If that is true of the
supposed cognitive values found in tragedy then at least some versions
of the cognitive theory collapse into the hedonistic theory. We value
the feeling of learning something occasioned by the experience of
fictions; that we actually learn something is not necessary for that
feeling to arise. A natural counter to this reduction of cognitive to
hedonistic accounts would be to note that while one may take as much
pleasure in merely seeming to learn as in actually learning from a
work of art, it is the pleasure of the latter experience that explains
the possibility of the pleasure of the former. Just as we find
pleasant the sweetness of artificial sweeteners only because we are
disposed to find pleasant the taste of actual sugar, so any cases of
delight we take in seeming to learn must be understood against a
broader background in which we take pleasure because we actually
learn.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Meaning and Function</h4>

<p>
A last kind of compensatory approach points to the ways in which
certain experiences are <em>meaningful</em> to us in part in virtue of
the pain or distress they involve, without any implication that such
pain or distress is otherwise intrinsically or instrumentally valuable
(Bloom 2021).</p>

<p>
Why should the pain an experience causes accrue to its meaningfulness?
Multiple explanations suggest themselves. From an evolutionary
perspective, that a given achievement involves suffering may reveal it
as a &ldquo;costly signal&rdquo; of the virtues or desires of the
achiever. The distress an activity causes may serve to distinguish
those who really value or need it (and thus are willing to endure its
associated pain) from those for whom the activity is relatively
unimportant, and thus something they&rsquo;d pursue only at a low
cost. For a discussion of how deliberate self-harm might serve as a
&ldquo;costly-signal&rdquo; see Hagen, Watson, and Hammerstein (2008).
For discussion, see Bloom (2021: 64). These explanations tend to focus
on how the willingness to undergo pain redounds to the authenticity of
an emotion or sincerity of an expressed desire for the experience in
which the pain is elicited.</p>

<p>
Related explanations posit certain functions, of which one is
typically unaware, in the pursuit of negative emotions through art.
Mar and Oatley (2008), for example, describes fiction as having the
function of social simulation. It is perhaps true that horror fiction
appears to rely on the same mental architecture as actual experiences
in producing its effects on our emotions and body. And perhaps
aversive fiction causes or enables an ability to learn from and deal
with genuine threats, losses, and other setbacks to our interests via
simulation, but that doesn&rsquo;t explain why we take pleasure in it
or pursue it. We would need to posit another explanatory factor here
that says that we desire (unconsciously?) to do things that further
our capacities, e.g., of responding to things that make us suffer.
&ldquo;Function&rdquo; here is used only in an evolutionary
sense&mdash;i.e., in the sense in which the psychological disposition
to have such experiences (pleasure from pain or fear) was acquired in
part because it helped to produce beings like us. Alternative accounts
favor an explanation that appealed to exaptation. The appeal to
evolution speaks only to the question of how our cognitive and
emotional makeup makes such experiences possible, not why now, in the
present day, we ought to desire these experiences.</p>

<p>
An important point about most compensatory approaches is that,
although drawing on Hume&rsquo;s introduction of the problem, they
construe the paradox in ways that depart from the Scottish
philosopher&rsquo;s terms. Hume posits an internal relation between
the disagreeable and agreeable responses engendered by tragedy. The
preceding compensatory approaches, by contrast, treat the negative
aspects of a work of art as merely a necessary cost to be entered into
an overall accounting of the net value of experiencing a work of art.
In that approach, the negative dimension of a work is not valued as
such; instead, it is valued only insofar as it plays a role in
producing the positive dimensions. If one could do away with the
sadness a tragedy causes us to feel while preserving the enlightenment
the play affords, the value of the experience would be the same or
increased. Some solutions that appeal to the pleasures of tragedy
exemplify this. Delight in spectacle does not require the spectacle
being produced through rebarbative events.</p>

<p>
The exceptions are compensatory approaches (what Levinson [2014b: xii]
calls &ldquo;organicist&rdquo;) in which the connection between the
negative and positive dimensions of the experience is tighter and the
latter is directly dependent on the former (presumably only within
certain ranges). Earlier, we saw an objection to solutions to the
paradox that say that, in a <em>pro tanto</em> manner, we take
pleasure in the formal or aesthetic dimensions of a tragedy and feel
pain about its content. The objection was that this implies that if we
could experience the formal aspects of tragedy in a work that caused
us no pain, we would prefer that to the tragedy. While this is of
course sometimes the case, it is implausible to posit it as a general
rule. We do often choose tragedies over comedies, without assuming the
latter is deficient in its formal values. A rejoinder here is the
proposal that the pain that tragic drama causes possesses a particular
character, making the experience of <em>that</em> pain a precondition
for realizing tragedy&rsquo;s particular compensatory good. That good,
in other words, cannot be furnished by a work without tragedy&rsquo;s
distressing dimension. In one such proposal, for example, it is only
in and through the suffering elicited by tragedy that we contemplate
our vulnerability to loss. In another proposal certain aesthetic or
<em>experiential</em> values can be realized only in our encounters
with such works (Budd 1995). The suffering we experience in watching a
tragedy might, for example, have cognitive value both in the familiar
sense in that it allows us to learn about the suffering of others, or
to enhance our capacity for empathy, and the more interesting sense in
which certain insights may be available to us only through our
suffering. Sadness might, for example impose an otherwise inaccessible
pattern of saliency on what we see and on our relation to it.</p>

<p>
Of course, tragedy&rsquo;s characteristic benefits may be multiple and
the theories cited above are not always mutually-exclusive in
characterizing the good that comes with the bad. However, a more
elaborate mapping of the logical space of such solutions would ask to
what extent a given theory excludes another, either by making the
latter explanation otiose, or denying the description of the phenomena
the latter assumes to be true.</p>

<h2 id="ContSolu">3. Contextual Solutions</h2>

<p>
Some explanations don&rsquo;t so much identify the reasons for which
we desire to experience disagreeable art, as identify the conditions
under which we are able to have those experiences. Two such conditions
are <em>distance</em> and <em>control</em>.</p>

<h3 id="Dist">3.1 Distance</h3>

<p>
It&rsquo;s often claimed of the artistic medium in which tragic
stories are told that it allows us to experience their content in a
safely &ldquo;distanced&rdquo; form, one that prevents us from
suffering as we would if we were witness to an analogous state of
affairs outside of that artistic context. As Edmund Burke (1757) notes
in his remarks on the sublime,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When danger or pain press too nearly, they are incapable of giving any
delight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and with
certain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as we
every day experience. (part 1 section VII)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his essay on the Laocoon (1766), Gotthold Ephraim Lessing suggests
that beauty can have such a distancing effect when he argues that
because artists understood it would have been too painful for
audiences to confront a fully realistic representation of the
suffering involved in the story, they represented that story in a
beautiful form.</p>

<p>
Accounts of such distancing identify a condition, perhaps a necessary
one, under which an experience of tragic drama can be pleasurable, but
not why it is pleasurable. Answers to that latter question may appeal
to a wide variety of considerations explaining why we enjoy a given
art form, many of them listed in
 <a href="#HedoComp">Section 2.1</a>.</p>
 
<p>
That there is a metaphorical distance between audiences and what they
are prompted to imagine by a fictional representation makes intuitive
sense. One can&rsquo;t intervene in a play&rsquo;s state of affairs to
change its outcome; one can&rsquo;t be physically harmed by the events
that a novel prompts us to visualize. And, even highly vivid
fiction-directed imaginings don&rsquo;t typically cause us to believe
that what we mentally represent is genuinely before us. In one kind of
account, emotions that are too raw, too overwhelming, or too powerful
to endure when experienced unmediated, are better contained when
experienced via the psychological and practical &ldquo;remove&rdquo;
audiences have toward fictional representations. See the discussion in
Robinson (2005) on &ldquo;Formal Devices as Coping Mechanisms&rdquo;
and the idea of a &ldquo;protective frame&rdquo; furnished by
knowledge of a situation&rsquo;s fictionality in Apter (1992). Without
such distancing, powerful emotions can get in the way of the
experience of pleasure that audiences can take in features of the
artistic representation. Likewise, such powerful emotions can prevent
us from achieving the various forms of insight and understanding for
which we value and pursue the experience of such works. In a
representative example of this approach, Menninghaus and his
collaborators (2017) draw on substantial empirical literature in
psychology to argue that only via the activation of certain
<em>distancing processes</em>, such as one&rsquo;s being made aware of
a film&rsquo;s fictional status, can there arise certain
<em>embracing</em> processes via which audiences experience pleasures
deriving from such things as &ldquo;an interplay between positive and
negative emotions&rdquo;; one&rsquo;s attention to a piece&rsquo;s
artistry; and the social dimensions of one&rsquo;s sharing with others
the experience of the work. Distancing processes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
keep negative emotions at some psychological distance, thereby
safeguarding the hedonic expectations of art reception against being
inevitably compromised by the experience of negative emotions. (2017:
3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, distancing prevents the negative emotions from getting
in the way of the positive emotions that would otherwise emerge in
one&rsquo;s experience of a work.</p>

<p>
Yet, despite its familiarity, there are conceptual problems with
employing the idea of distancing in a solution to the paradox of
tragedy. These problems emerge when we try to unpack what is literally
asserted when one says tragedies distance audiences from the horrible
states of affairs they represent. Let us suppose that what is meant by
distancing is a kind of moderation or subduing of an otherwise extreme
emotional response. To say we are distanced by a factor such as
fictionality is to say that we feel an emotion with less intensity
than we otherwise would if such fictionality were not present. We are
then able to avail ourselves of those pleasures and other benefits of
tragedy whose emergence would be frustrated by emotions that are more
extreme. One objection to such an account calls into question the very
premise that audiences for tragic drama and the like <em>are</em>
distanced in that emotion-subduing way that the explanation proposes.
For, <em>prima facie</em>, audiences of tragic fictions do experience
powerfully painful emotions, Having such affective experiences does
not impede their pleasure, but, if Hume is right, enhances it. An
inverse of that objection is that, as Hume notes, under certain
conditions we can take pleasure in non-fictional representations of
awful things, even though confronting them directly would cause us
distress. There is no assumption of fictionality in Cicero&rsquo;s
oratory of terrible events, yet in his eloquence, Hume writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the uneasiness of the melancholy passions is not only overpowered and
effaced by something stronger of an opposite kind; but the whole
impulse of those passions is converted into pleasure, and swells the
delight which the eloquence raises in us. (1757 [1987: 220])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A more significant problem may be found in the claim that we can speak
of the <em>same emotion</em>, whether it is experienced unmediated or
in a manner that involves putative distancing. For to adopt a
distanced attitude toward someone for whom one feels anguished pity is
not to continue to feel anguished pity, just &ldquo;at a
distance&rdquo;. It is to feel something else altogether, or not to
feel at all. The distancing approach does not explain how we can
endure feeling an emotion of the <em>same kind and quality</em> toward
a fictional state of affairs but not toward an analogous real state of
affairs. It elides, instead, two categorically different
emotions&mdash;one that is weak, short-lived, potentially
dis-passionate, and one that is overwhelming or otherwise so powerful
as to block any pleasures that the occasion might allow. Claiming that
the affective or phenomenological character of the emotion we feel for
a fiction is different from that which we feel for like affairs in
real life can suggest a solution to the paradox. Specifically, it
would be to reject the <em>appreciation condition</em>&mdash;the claim
that properly appreciating an artwork of the relevant kind causes one
to feel serious distress. However, that solution comes at the
considerable cost of denying the presence of the aversive feelings we
experience in watching painful art that makes the appreciation
condition plausible in the first place.</p>

<p>
An alternative objection to the distancing approach is that it
improperly locates the source of the putative ameliorative effect that
fictionality has on our emotions. For, as noted earlier, many
non-fictional representations can elicit pleasure through, or along
with, causing distress. Even as their contents cause feelings of
distress, pity, and disgust, we sometimes enjoy reading of such things
as historical narratives of violent battles, tabloid reports of
gruesome deaths, and seeing beautiful or otherwise compelling
photographs of abject and suffering individuals, natural disasters,
cities in ruins, and other subjects we would not take pleasure in
seeing face-to-face. Perhaps the distancing model must dispense with
the distinction between fictions and nonfictions, and help itself
instead to a different distinction, such as that between
representational and confrontational contexts (Matravers 2014). Here,
fictionality, as such, is not what explains our capacity to take
pleasure in painful experiences, rather being fictional is only one of
many ways in which a state of affairs can be something into which we
cannot intervene and cannot be practically affected by.</p>

<p>
Finally, the distancing approach attributes a mental state to
audiences that is at odds with the mental state briefly referred to in
 <a href="#HedoMetaResp">Section 2.2</a>
 that at least <em>prima facie</em> appears to be a precondition of a
fiction causing intense feelings: imaginative immersion. Sometimes
called <em>absorption</em> or <em>fictional transportation</em>,
imaginative immersion describes an engagement with the contents of a
fictional representation typified by several dimensions: <em>inter
alia,</em> selective and sustained attention; a fluency in access to
and processing of information supplied by one&rsquo;s attention;
cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses that are experienced as
endogenously elicited by the contents of the representation, rather
than by the representational vehicle itself; and, a diminished
self-consciousness or meta-reflective attention to those responses
(Gerrig 1993; Green &amp; Brock 2002; Mazzocco et al. 2010).</p>

<p>
Plausibly, a fictional story can cause us to feel aversive emotions
only when we are absorbed in its content (as opposed to, say, immersed
in the second order experience of performing a literary analysis). But
if this is true, it is hard to see how the distancing approach can
claim both that we can experience such aversive emotions and be aware
of ourselves as removed from the state of affairs represented by the
fiction. The absorption condition says that only by audiences being
imaginatively immersed in the state of affairs a tragedy represents
can it have its characteristic effects, while the distancing condition
says we experience the pain and pleasure of tragedy only when
understanding ourselves as being at a good remove from that state of
affairs. Hence, the distancing and immersion approaches represent
competing pictures of our mental states during artistic
engagements.</p>

<p>
Although different explanations of the paradox of tragedy may offer
distinct, yet complementary, causes for the phenomenon, we can see how
the distancing approach stands as a direct competitor to compensatory
solutions. Compensatory approaches like those in
 <a href="#CompSolu">Section 2</a>
 take the strength of the negatively valenced emotion aroused by a
disturbing work of art to require some positively-valenced emotion, or
other valuable property for the whole experience of the work of art to
be sought after and valued. But if distancing <em>eliminates or
reduces</em> the awfulness of some fiction state of affairs, no such
or less such compensation is required to understand why the fiction as
a whole is desirable. To the extent that distancing has the effect its
proponents say, the compensatory solutions become otiose<em>.</em></p>

<h3 id="Cont">3.2 Control</h3>

<p>
The second kind of condition under which it is proposed that tragedies
can be pleasurable is <em>control</em>. Because I know that I can stop
or modify my experience of painful art, the pain is less severe, or
acquires a different valence than it has in ordinary contexts.
Specifically, under such a condition one source of the badness of pain
is eliminated: one&rsquo;s not knowing that it can be controlled.
Control in this sense is broader than and can include the dimension of
distancing described earlier: specifically, according to the control
theory, if one believes one cannot distance oneself from the
phenomenon then one cannot take pleasure in it.</p>

<p>
Theorists who propose that a control condition operates in our
experience of tragic drama stress the greater degree of power we have
over the pain caused by works of art than over the pain caused by
ordinary experience (see Eaton 1982; Morreall 1985). Specifically, we
can enjoy tragic and other sorts of aversive works of art when we are
aware we can direct our thoughts and actions <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em>
the work in question. Theorists argue that such control limits or
changes the character of the putative painfulness of some works of
art, such that the pain at issue doesn&rsquo;t generate the paradox
that a desire for, or valuing of, ordinary pain would. One way such
control is manifested is in our awareness, when experiencing negative
affect <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> art, that the story belongs to a
genre in which it is typical for all things to work out in the end.
One may also simply infer a happy ending from what one knows about a
work, as one&rsquo;s sadness over the life-threatening illness of a
television character is made tolerable by one&rsquo;s knowledge that a
series wouldn&rsquo;t kill them off so soon. Feelings of anxiety or
fear are therefore accommodated through modes of affective regulation
that rely on our familiarity with the artform in question.</p>

<p>
Solutions to the paradox based on control face two major objections.
One is that already lodged against distance theories: the control
theorist argues that the typical negative valence of a given emotion
is ameliorated or eliminated when our experience of it is one over
which we have some power. The problem here is assuming that thus
separated from its displeasing or aversive dimension via a sense of
control, the negative emotion is the same emotion it would otherwise
be. Theories of emotions that hold that the valence of an emotion is
an intrinsic quality of it would disagree. For them, a solution to the
paradox based on the control condition doesn&rsquo;t explain how we
can take pleasure in a displeasing emotion, it just implicitly denies
that we experience the displeasing emotion in question. The second
objection is that the control condition seems false to experience: one
can feel fully in control over whether or not one attends to a
horrifying, disgusting, or tragic state of affairs in a fictional film
without that sense of control making attending to those elements any
less displeasing (Gaut 1993: 338). Attending to a fictional
representation of such events might be less distressing than actually
witnessing such events. However, it is not clear that whether control
is given or withheld over attending to the fictional representation of
awful circumstances makes a difference in the aversive feelings it
causes.</p>

<h2 id="ConvAcco">4. Conversionary Accounts</h2>

<p>
Some explanations of the paradox suggest that in our experience of
painful art, the content is rendered in such a way so as to
&ldquo;convert&rdquo; its distressing elements, as a kind of raw
material, into a pleasurable form. Hume&rsquo;s account lends itself
to this interpretation (Yanal 1991). It is not only, he writes, that
the &ldquo;melancholy passions&rdquo; are overcome by &ldquo;something
stronger of the opposite kind&rdquo; but that those passions are
&ldquo;converted into pleasure&rdquo; (1757 [1987: 220]). Here, Hume
stresses that the negative emotions aroused by the distressing events
must be of a sufficiently high intensity for the accompanying or
consequent pleasure furnished by the conversion of those passions to
be as substantial as it is. So, for example, Cicero&rsquo;s eloquence
applied to ordinary events would not result in a pleasure with as
great a magnitude as when it&rsquo;s applied to awful ones.</p>

<p>
One explanation of the phenomenon Hume describes appeals to a
difference between an initial painful or distressing experience of a
stimulus and the experience of that stimulus in light of one&rsquo;s
awareness that it poses no threat of injury or harm to one&rsquo;s
well-being. In this connection, Paul Rozin coined the term
&ldquo;benign masochism&rdquo; to refer to the enjoyment of
&ldquo;initially negative experiences that the body (brain) falsely
interprets as threatening&rdquo;. This realization that the pain poses
no real danger, Rozin and his colleagues write, &ldquo;leads to
pleasure derived from &lsquo;mind over body.&rsquo;&rdquo; (2013:
 439).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Even assuming that the psychological description is correct, the
phenomenon described may not exemplify a &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; of
an emotion, but rather a replacement of one emotion with another, the
latter constituted by a different cognitive base, e.g., from a belief
or perception to an imagining. On cognitive bases of emotions, see
Deonna and Teroni (2008 [2012]) and Gilmore (2020: 45). Of course,
distinguishing here between conversion and replacement may be
construed as only a verbal dispute.</p>

<p>
An alternative possibility for capturing the conversionary proposal
would be to appeal to the familiar idea that the form, manner, or
medium of a representation shapes our responses to its contents. To
use Hume&rsquo;s example, death and destruction, the representation of
which would normally provoke horror and pity, give us pleasure when
represented in Cicero&rsquo;s eloquent description. And the greater
the pity and horror those events would produce absent that eloquence,
the greater the pleasure they can elicit when conveyed via a
representation possessed of an eloquent form. That different modes of
representing an event may elicit, respectively, different kinds and
degrees of emotional responses is uncontroversial. But that
explanation of varied responses to different framings of the same
event doesn&rsquo;t tell us how distressing emotions are
&ldquo;converted&rdquo; into pleasurable ones. One reason is that, as
we saw earlier in compensatory theories that appeal to <em>form</em>
as compensation for <em>content</em>, our responses to distressing
works of art are always to the content-as-represented, that is, the
content in a given form, manner, style, etc. There are not, as it
were, two stages in our exposure to such events: one in which we feel
distress over what is described &ldquo;independent&rdquo; of their
having been represented for us and a second in which that distress is
changed into pleasure. There is just our response to those
events-as-represented.</p>

<p>
It is a truism of artistic production that a given event that would
provoke pain or distress if it actually occurred can be rendered in a
fictional form that will provoke other kinds of emotions, such as
laughter, or no emotion at all. Picaresque novels often subject their
protagonists to various forms of violent injury that would indeed be
painful, if real, to behold, but are a source of humor when confined
to a fiction. The animated series <em>Southpark</em> kills off the
little boy Kenny in one episode after another, but to only comedic
effect; and it should go without saying, the history of art is
populated by paintings and sculptures of murder, rape, and torture
rendered in stylized and beautiful forms that evoke wonder and
delight, not the revulsion that the representation of actual such
events would cause. However, such cases illustrate not the conversion
of emotions, but merely their elicitation. Furthermore, when we
confine our attention to fictional objects, there doesn&rsquo;t even
exist a contrasting case of the events framed in a different way. For,
as noted in
 <a href="#HedoComp">Section 2.1</a>,
 there is no sense in which we have access to the contents of a
fiction independent of their representation. The contents of a fiction
are <em>constituted</em> by how they are represented. Those events may
be distressing or pleasurable to behold, but it is not the case that
the style, manner, form, etc. of how they are represented somehow
transforms what they are &ldquo;prior&rdquo; to that
representation.</p>

<p>
Even if we had a plausible description of how our emotions elicited by
tragedy are converted from distress to pleasure, conversionary
accounts face the challenge of showing that the relevant emotions are
transformed into forms in which they relinquish their negative
valence, while remaining <em>the same emotion</em>. As we saw in the
objection to distancing solutions to the paradox, it is highly
controversial to assert that when a given emotion is shorn of its
usual valence, it remains an instance of the same emotion-kind. There
are many theories of emotions and no consensus over which has the best
intensional, extensional, and explanatory account. However, it seems
highly intuitive that if a given emotion kind has <em>any</em>
essential features, how the emotion feels (its phenomenology) is one
of them. If, as conversionary accounts suggest, aesthetic contexts can
effect a transformation in a given emotion to one with a valence not
at all resembling that which it has in its usual manifestations, we
may have a case not of the conversion of a given emotion, but a
replacement of one kind of emotion with another. When we turn to
Revisionary Solutions in
 <a href="#ReviSolu">Section 6</a>
 we&rsquo;ll see a solution to the paradox that explicitly tries to
meet that challenge by rejecting the intuition that the valence we
associate with a given instance of an emotion is one of its essential
features.</p>

<h2 id="BroaApprPhen">5. A Broader Approach to the Phenomenon</h2>

<p>
When the experience at issue is construed without restriction to
fictions, many kinds of engagements outside of the artistic sphere
fall within its scope. We often find satisfaction in nonfictions,
e.g., in historical narratives, even as they generate pity or anger.
Many people are titillated by disturbing pictures or reports in the
news. Enjoying Reality TV depends on its participants genuinely
behaving in ways that viewers find deplorable. Others find violent
sports repellent but enthralling. A long-distance runner might find
satisfaction in exercising to the point of exhaustion, and not just
for the training stimulus it offers. And, for a thrill, one might eat
too-spicy chili peppers, risk one&rsquo;s physical well-being, or
imagine inordinately nauseating or frightful circumstances. See Bloom
(2021) for a compendium of such contexts in which people seem to take
pleasure in undergoing experiences that are <em>prima facie</em>
unpleasant</p>

<p>
When construed in a descriptive fashion, the puzzle arising from our
engagement with tragic works of art assumes that they call for a
response that <em>contrasts</em> with that which we tend to exhibit in
a class of normal cases. However, the wider the range is of relevantly
similar experiences such as those surveyed above, the more dubious is
the premise that initially gives rise to the puzzle: viz., our finding
value in some experiences in virtue of the negative feelings they
evoke is so <em>unlike</em> our other sorts of attitudes and behavior
that it requires some distinctive explanation. However, if it is true
that we have that response in many contexts outside of our engagement
with tragedy, then its paradoxical air is difficult to sustain. We
might still want to know what gives us pleasure in tragedy but there
would be no special <em>paradox</em> of tragedy calling for a solution
(Gilmore 2020: 159&ndash;60). Indeed, we may contrast those sorts of
socially acceptable pursuits in which one takes satisfaction in
one&rsquo;s distress with other sorts that <em>do</em> call for a
special explanation, such as some practices of deliberate
self-harm.</p>

<p>
Resisting this denial that there is a paradox calls for some
demonstration that the experience of pleasure through pain in art is
sufficiently unlike that found in ordinary non-artistic contexts to
demand its own explanation. Two such approaches can be found in
<em>Revisionary</em> solutions.</p>

<h2 id="ReviSolu">6. Revisionary Solutions</h2>

<p>
Revisionary approaches to the paradox of tragedy attack the premise
that seems most immune to being falsified, the <em>appreciation
condition</em>. Applied to the cases at hand, that condition holds
that properly appreciating tragic drama (or other relevantly similar
works of art) involves forming a mental state with a negative
valence<em>.</em> In other words, to respond appropriately to a tragic
drama is, to undergo sadness, distress, anger, or some other emotion
or feeling that is in itself unpleasant, undesirable, or
disvalued.</p>

<p>
Revisionary approaches reject that characterization of the state we
are in as audiences for such painful art. They allow that a proper
appreciation of the works in question elicits negative emotions, but
deny that those negative emotions must carry their characteristically
unpleasant feeling or phenomenology. Such theories argue that the
typical valence of negative emotions is not present in the contexts in
which we take pleasure in painful art, but the negative emotions
remain.</p>

<p>
Describing such a theory, De Clercq (2014) notes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
According to one type of solution to the paradox, no emotion is in
itself agreeable or disagreeable to experience. So-called negative
emotions may be typically disagreeable, but they need not have a
negative &ldquo;hedonic charge&rdquo; (Morreall 1985; Walton 1990;
Gaut 1993; Neill 1992). (De Clercq 2014: 112)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If it is not a disagreeable feeling, what then explains the
attribution of a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; aspect to those emotions
elicited by tragic drama? Revisionist theories say the negative aspect
belongs not to the phenomenology of undergoing the emotion, but to the
evaluation of the situation that the emotion is about.</p>

<p>
Walton thus remarks</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s characterization of sorrow as a passion that is &ldquo;in
itself disagreeable&rdquo; is very much open to question. What is
clearly disagreeable are the things we are sorrowful about&mdash;the
loss of an opportunity, the death of a friend&mdash;not the feeling or
experience of sorrow itself. (1990: 258).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, the sorrow one feels for a fictional character need not be in
itself a disagreeable or negatively-valenced experience; it is
undesirable by virtue of the undesirable situation that it registers
an evaluation of (Neill 1992: 62). This approach treats the negativity
of a negative emotion as, at least sometimes, a relational property of
the event or state of affairs the emotion is a response to. Only
secondarily, and only sometimes, does the disvalue of the state of
affairs prompt an unpleasantness in the phenomenology of undergoing
the emotion elicited by awareness of that state of affairs.</p>

<p>
This distinction between the negativity of an emotion&rsquo;s
characteristic phenomenology and the negativity of the event or state
of affairs the emotion is about may make sense only within an
excessively cognitive characterization of emotions. Yes, our sorrow
<em>presents</em> its object&mdash;the death of a friend&mdash;as
disagreeable, as counting against one&rsquo;s wellbeing, as a loss of
value, etc. But it is at least <em>prima facie</em> true that sorrow
itself is undesirable beyond its instantiation merely being an
indication of an undesirable state of affairs. That is because the
negative valence of such emotions is the means by which they express,
<em>qua</em> emotions, the undesirability of their objects. This is
how emotions contrast with beliefs&mdash;which lack a characteristic
phenomenology&mdash;as distinct ways of representing the values of
things. Consider how bad <em>being anxious</em> feels, when anxiety is
essentially about something that has not yet happened and hence has
not yet instantiated the harm or loss of value of what, if the event
comes about, may be an additional factor counting against one&rsquo;s
wellbeing. The badness of the feeling of being anxious is a feature of
the emotion because of the emotion&rsquo;s function in putting us on
guard against immanent harm. This is just as the badness of the
feeling caused by disgust is a feature of the emotion in its capacity
as a warning signal, or reminder, of the danger of being exposed to
harmful substances.</p>

<p>
Of course, different theories of emotions will differ in the extent to
which they see the standard phenomenology of an emotion as an
essential feature of it. If a theory, for example, includes within the
scope of experiences of fear, those in which the typical
unpleasantness of feeling fear is absent, then revisionist approaches
are on firm ground in claiming that such negative emotions need not
have a negative hedonic charge. But the <em>prima facie</em> challenge
to such revisionism is to question why its opponents should admit into
the extension of an emotion concept <em>any</em> putative cases of
such responses shorn of their typical feelings.</p>

<p>
If the revisionist view here was presented in the strongest terms,
where the <em>only</em> negativity of a negative emotion belongs to
the state of affairs the emotion is about, this would entail the
implausible conclusion that there is no point in engaging in the
common practice of trying to manage one&rsquo;s sadness or distress
about some sad or distressing state of affairs. Unless one&rsquo;s
goal is to convince oneself that the situation was
<em>misinterpreted</em> as sad or distressing, trying to manage
one&rsquo;s feelings about it would be inconsistent with recognizing
its truth. However, a significant challenge threatens even a more
moderate version of the revisionist proposal&mdash;one that allows
that the feeling of merely undergoing a negative emotion can be among
the sources of its negativity. The challenge is to explain why the
negative emotions elicited by tragic dramas are exceptions to emotions
of their kind in not causing unpleasantness or distress, or in causing
just pleasure. The revisionist theory cannot help itself to the
various proposals that the context of fictions&mdash;e.g., our
distance from the represented events&mdash;ameliorates the pain of
witnessing distressing events. For then the revisionist theory
collapses into one of those theories and its denial that the
displeasing emotions we feel for tragedy possess a negative valence
becomes unmotivated.</p>

<p>
An alternative revisionary approach suggests that the emotions we feel
in fictional contexts ought not to be assimilated to emotions we feel
in real life contexts because the former are a particular kind of
emotion associated with pretense and imagining:
&ldquo;quasi-emotions&rdquo; in the nomenclature that Walton employs
in his theory of fiction (1978 and 1990). The thought here is that
imagining or pretending to have an experience of <em>x</em> does not
require imagining or pretending to experience all of the properties
constitutive of <em>x</em>. Imagining that I&rsquo;m flying does not
require me to imagine experiencing the feeling of flying (even though
it might involve visually imagining my flying or imagining believing
that I&rsquo;m flying). So imagining feeling sad over the death of
Cordelia need not require my response to exhibit all the properties it
would if I were really sad, such as sadness&rsquo;s valence and
characteristic motivational dimensions. The solution here is to deny
that our experience of such art is genuinely painful, a cause of
suffering, a source of sadness, disgust, fear, and so on, in whole or
part. Instead, what appear to be such negatively-valenced emotions are
in fact only imagined or pretend affective responses. These responses
share certain characteristics with those of emotions we feel in
non-fictional contexts, just not their unpleasantness. If this is
true, then there is no conflict between the <em>coordination
condition</em> that says we don&rsquo;t take pleasure in painful
experiences and the <em>response condition</em> that affirms that we
take pleasure in the experience of aversive art. For our experience of
such art on this understanding does not involve pain, but involves
rather an affective state that only resembles pain while not being an
instance of the kind of emotion that we may feel for genuinely tragic
states of affairs that we know to be actual.</p>

<p>
Whether the emotions we feel for the contents of fictions are
continuous with those we have for what is represented by our beliefs
and other truth-apt attitudes is a substantial question addressed in
discussions of the so-called paradox of fictions. Reasons to doubt
that such emotions felt for the objects of imaginings are of the same
kind as &ldquo;real world&rdquo; emotions, include: asymmetries in
their phenomenology, differences in their functional roles, the
cognitive or evaluative content of each affective state, and the
direct-objects of each state (Gilmore 2013; Stecker 2011).</p>

<p>
Whatever the resolution is of that debate, it should be noticed that,
even if such emotions are identified as only
&ldquo;quasi&rdquo;&mdash;as within a pretense or imagining, not
outside and directed in&mdash;this does not entail that they are
somehow less painful or disagreeable.</p>

<p>
For it is plausibly the case that in order to experientially
<em>imagine</em> feeling sad over the death of a fictional character,
one has to experience the most central, or even constitutive, aspect
of sadness&mdash;its negative valence. Without that, why say one is
(experientially) imagining feeling sad, rather than merely imagining
that one occupies the perceptual and other dimensions that accompany
feeling sad, without feeling sad? Also, it might be suggested that,
aside from the negative evaluations they represent of their targets,
what fiction-directed sadness and ordinary sadness have in common such
that we treat them as intimately related is that they <em>feel
bad</em>. In other words, any plausible interpretation of the role of
quasi-emotions in our engagements with fictions must allow the
possibility that they carry with them similar bodily, affective, and
other phenomenological dimensions as their counterpart ordinary
emotions. They may, as in one interpretation, lack the dimension of
belief, or commitment to a proposition, about their object being real,
and lack any motivation or reason for action (as one can&rsquo;t
intervene in a fictional world) but their being identified as
quasi-emotions of particular type may depend upon their having a
similar phenomenology to the real-world-directed prototypes. So even
allowing that it is a quasi-emotion that we experience when we engage
with aversive art forms (quasi-disgust, quasi-horror, quasi-sadness)
we still need to explain how our pleasure in undergoing such feelings
is consistent with our tendency (per <em>the coordination
condition</em>) not to take pleasure in, and to avoid where possible,
experiences with negative valences (Friend 2007). Whether the emotions
we have for tragic dramas are real or pretend, they carry feelings of
pain and distress; why we choose to engage in an activity that causes
those feelings&mdash;perhaps even for the realization of those
feelings&mdash;remains a puzzle.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
