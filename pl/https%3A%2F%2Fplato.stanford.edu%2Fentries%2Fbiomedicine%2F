<h1>Philosophy of Biomedicine</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Apr 9, 2020; substantive revision Tue Jul 15, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Despite the simple name, biomedicine is not simply the area of overlap
between biology and medicine. It is a framework, a set of
philosophical commitments, a global institution woven into Western
culture and its power dynamics, and more. Biomedicine is the umbrella
theoretical framework for most health science and health technology
work done in academic and government settings. Western medical
practices and the surrounding healthcare infrastructure are
principally biomedical. Health-related corporations are predominantly
biomedical in orientation (with the exception of a few homeopathic
producers and other scattered outliers). International medical aid
mainly offers biomedical resources. Biomedicine, in other words, is
the name for how most powerful global institutions envision the
relations between biological sciences and medicine.</p>

<p>
The biomedical model is in fact so commonplace that it is easy to
overlook how philosophically weighty (and contentious) its core
commitments are: that health phenomena must be understood in terms of
physical/biochemical entities and processes, that experimental
techniques are the preferred means of acquiring and assessing
health-related knowledge, and that human bodies are best understood as
composed of a collection of subsidiary parts and processes (Krieger,
2011, p. 130). In addition to critiquing those core commitments,
philosophers have also disputed connected issues regarding the
meanings of health and disease, the nature of biomedical knowledge and
expertise, the value of reductionist thinking, the value of
biomedicine&rsquo;s global institutions, etc. Some philosophers have
also proposed alternative frameworks for understanding the relations
between biology and medicine. Though, relatively little literature is
directed at biomedicine per se. The fact that the philosophical
literature is so critical is in part because 1) biomedicine is so
expansive that there is no shortage of flaws to identify, and 2)
biomedicine is deeply embedded in the current global order, and hence
is tied directly or indirectly to all of the goods and ills of that
order.</p>

<p>
Biomedicine&rsquo;s expansiveness includes a set of epistemological
commitments as well as a connected set of institutions. Moreover, much
philosophical work directly or indirectly critiquing biomedicine
leaves it unclear whether suggested improvements are small amendments
or whether biomedicine as a whole is destabilized as a result of these
weaknesses. Since &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; is often used interchangeably
with &ldquo;biomedicine&rdquo;, it is often difficult to distinguish
processes, critiques, arguments, etc. about &ldquo;biomedicine&rdquo;
from those about &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
This entry will, as much as possible, avoid duplicating the work done
in the thorough
 <a href="../medicine/">Philosophy of Medicine</a>
 entry. That entry focuses on elucidating the work done by that branch
of philosophy, which according to entry authors Reiss and Ankeny, has
&ldquo;dedicated journals and professional organizations, a relatively
well-established canon of scholarly literature, and distinctive
questions and problems&rdquo;. Most of the &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;
examined in &ldquo;philosophy of biomedicine&rdquo; is medicine
pursued within a biomedicine framework, so there is much overlap. Yet,
this entry will accomplish something other than what that entry does.
This entry will review the philosophical literature (and some
literature in allied fields, such as history of medicine) that
scrutinizes the biomedical framework itself, in whole or in part. This
chapter will also not provide a detailed history of medicine,
including its innumerable social and institutional changes. Readers
interested in an overview of the history of medicine to accompany this
text can refer to Bynum (2008).</p>

<h2 id="BioFraForMedBio">1. Biomedicine as a Framework for Medicine + Biology</h2>

<p>
Consult with a primary care physician when feeling ill. Perhaps they
send you to a medical lab that will take a blood sample to run a
biochemical analysis. After the results arrive, consult with a
physician specialist whose expertise is the particular bodily organ or
system where the ailment is localized. The specialist prescribes a
drug that has been mass-produced in a factory, after a biology
laboratory extracted the active ingredient from a natural source, or
perhaps synthesized it from scratch. The drug&rsquo;s efficacy has
been proven by testing the drug experimentally on two groups with the
relevant disease, randomly sorted into an experimental group and a
control group so that the drug&rsquo;s measurable bodily effects could
be scrutinized and counted. This is biomedicine. It has quickly grown
to be so pervasive around the globe that it is difficult to
characterize biomedicine.</p>

<h3 id="WhaBio">1.1 What is biomedicine?</h3>

<p>
As explored in this entry, and outlined in how the sections are
divided in the entry, biomedicine has many facets. It is a very large
and complex thing. It is a morphing historical product of the
post-World War II West. It is a contemporary global social
institution. It is an epistemology of medical research and practice
(albeit with factions). It is a set of ontological and metaphysical
commitments. And more.</p>

<p>
The US National Cancer Institute (NCI
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>,
 accessed 13 March 2025) defines biomedicine as synonymous with
&ldquo;allopathic medicine, conventional medicine, mainstream
medicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine&rdquo;. By contrast,
Clarke et al. (2003) take an expansive view of the nature of
biomedicine, contending that it is an evolving entity, a cohesive and
developing whole that consists of elements ranging from the assertion
that good health is a personal moral obligation to the increasing
reliance on &ldquo;computerization and data banking&rdquo; (A. E.
Clarke et al., 2003).</p>

<p>
Krieger offers a detailed examination of the history and philosophy of
the &ldquo;biomedicine approach,&rdquo; and extracts three key
epistemological tenets of the view. Among the many features of a
biomedical perspective, three stand out as fundamental regarding its
approach to investigating disease (Lock &amp; Gordon, 1988; Fee &amp;
Krieger, 1993; Krieger, 1994; Lawrence &amp; Weisz, 1998; Cambrosio
&amp; Keating, 2001; Bynum, 2008). They are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
First, specific to biomedicine: the domain of disease and its causes
is restricted to solely biological, chemical, and physical phenomena;
Second, shared with many natural sciences: an emphasis on laboratory
research and technology and, as translated to health research, a
discounting of research questions that cannot be studied by randomized
clinical trials (or their analogs, e.g., &ldquo;natural
experiments&rdquo;); and Third: an embrace of
&ldquo;reductionism,&rdquo; a philosophical and methodological stance
(discussed more fully below) that holds that phenomena are best
explained by the properties of their parts. (Krieger, 2011, p.
130).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kriger&rsquo;s account of biomedicine offers a compelling distillation
of the epistemological commitments of biomedical science. Though since
this is an entry on philosophy of biomedicine, the entry will be
organized around philosophical dimensions and debates, rather than
being organized directly around these core theoretical tenets (e.g.
the upcoming section is on ontological and metaphysical commitments).
Additionally, this entry will supplement the tenets identified by
Krieger with discussion of connected issues, such as philosophical
critiques of biomedicine as a social institution (Section 4). A longer
discussion of reductionism is below, in Section 3.4) We use the terms
&ldquo;framework&rdquo; and &ldquo;approach&rdquo; to describe
biomedicine, in an attempt to avoid narrowly overcommitting to any
particular philosophical system. Biomedicine may or may not qualify as
one of Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s &ldquo;paradigms&rdquo;, in the way that
the heliocentric model of the solar system is a paradigm&mdash;a
complex worldview in which the viewpoints cannot be straightforwardly
translated back-and-forth with an alternative paradigm (i.e. if we try
to translate the concepts of biomedicine to the pre-biomedical
concepts of humoral theory, discussed in Section 1.2 (Kuhn, 1962).
Alternatively, biomedicine seems to qualify as one of Imre
Lakatos&rsquo; Research Programmes, a different way of conceiving of
the way that research communities intellectually cohere (Lakatos,
1968). It&rsquo;s a question of how biomedicine serves as a means of
organizing and guiding research. Without getting too lost in the
technical criteria, biomedicine shares the Kuhnian paradigm quality of
being incommensurable (or at least more or less so) with other
conceptions of biology and health. Scholars of complementary medicine
have spent enormous effort searching for ways that traditional medical
practices&mdash;e.g. herbal treatments handed down over
generations&mdash;can get a foothold in a medical world dominated by
biomedicine. It is telling that there is no question that
&lsquo;proof&rsquo; of a treatment&rsquo;s efficacy requires starting
from scratch, by examining the herb&rsquo;s chemical makeup, isolating
and analyzing which chemical components are the active ingredients,
and then testing safety and efficacy, all entirely within
biomedicine&rsquo;s rules. Whatever explanations might have been
offered by herbalists (e.g. &lsquo;it calms turmoil in the
stomach&rsquo;) are irrelevant untranslatable knowledge. Biomedicine
also shares the Lakatosian Research Programme quality of (largely
implicitly) dictating what sorts of internal dispute about biomedicine
is permissible. Within the biomedical Research Programme, one is
invited to question whether a particular experimental design is
suitable; one is not permitted to reject experimentation entirely.</p>

<h3 id="HisBio">1.2 The history of biomedicine</h3>

<p>
Biomedicine as a global institution coevolved with its characteristic
philosophical positions. While key elements, such as laboratory
biology, were present in the 19th century and even before,
&ldquo;World War II is usually presented as a turning point in the
&lsquo;biomedicalization&rsquo; process&rdquo; (L&ouml;wy, 2011, p.
117). The term &ldquo;biomedicine&rdquo; was first used between the
two world wars as a shorthand for some of the medical and scientific
work being done on radioactive materials (Keating, Cambrosio, &amp;
Wilson III, 2003; L&ouml;wy, 2011, pp. 49&ndash;55). But biomedicine
only came into its own during the period of economic and social
transformation in industrialized Western countries that followed World
War Two:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In industrialized countries, the post-World War II era was also
characterized by important increases in public funding for medical
research, the extension of health insurance to large parts of the
population (a process that, in nearly all the Western countries, the
United States excepted, was also supported by the state), and the
rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry. (L&ouml;wy 2011: 117)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If biomedicine is a recent historical development, then what exactly
came before it? Many different frameworks for health existed before
the rise of biomedicine, though many such frameworks exist now despite
the dominance of biomedicine. Some have been distinctly influenced by
or merged with biomedicine. For instance, osteopathic medicine has
gradually gone from a full alternative system of medicine (focusing on
manipulation of body via pressure, stretching and other means of
readjustment of bodily structure in order to rebalance internal
processes), to an alternative track of medical education/practice that
has in large part converged with the biomedical/allopathic medicine
track (McClain, 2017; Stark, 2013). Insofar as biomedicine formed in
the West, it is helpful to see it in contrast to the medical and
philosophical traditions that preceded it. That tradition is the
Hippocratic tradition&mdash;the views attributed to Hippocrates and
over two millennia of re-interpretations, riffs, amendments, and other
alterations. At the core of Hippocratic medicine were two views.
First, it made a commitment to methodological naturalism&mdash;a
refusal to attribute disease processes to the work of gods and other
supernatural beings (Conrad, Neve, Nutton, Porter, &amp; Wear, 1995).
Though, it is worth noting that for much of that history, elements of
astrology, talismans, and some forms of magic were understood as
essentially natural phenomena (e.g., the sun obviously affects health
via sunburns and such, so it is not absurd to have inferred that
planets could have their own subtle effects on bodies too). Second, it
understood health as a matter of balance&mdash;and disease as a matter
of imbalance&mdash;of the humors. Humoral theory was interpreted in
many different ways, but centered on the idea that health and disease
are attributable to the interactions of anatomical humors (blood,
phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile), which were in turn directly tied
to a much larger cosmology of the elements (e.g. blood is linked to
air, the springtime, a combination of heat and moisture, the heart,
and the astrological influence of the planet Jupiter) (Conrad et al.,
1995).</p>

<p>
The humoral framework remained dominant until emerging scientific
approaches began challenging its foundations&mdash;a shift that would
eventually lead to what we now recognize as biomedicine. However, the
actual impact of this biomedical framework has become a subject of
intense debate. Thomas McKeown was an influential critic of the
biomedical institution (including the work done during its early
twentieth century prehistory), having authored the blockbuster volume
The Role of Medicine: Dream, Mirage, or Nemesis (1976). McKeown
reevaluated the historical record and available evidence to instead
hypothesize that the social and economic changes in the West that
improved public health conditions were more responsible for population
health improvements than biomedicine&rsquo;s growth. Put bluntly, he
argued that twentieth century modernity (economic development,
improved nutrition, etc.) caused populations in the West to get
healthier over time, then modernity went on to also cause the growth
of contemporary medicine/biomedicine, but the medical advances
themselves played a generally secondary role in supporting the health
improvements. His work has inspired decades worth of debates over the
validity of his bold claims, which have been largely overturned or
largely vindicated, depending on whom one asks (Link &amp; Phelan
2002).</p>

<p>
There is long-standing debate in health policy over exactly how
successful the biomedical model has been over its relatively short
historical trajectory. The growth of the biomedical model in Western
countries occurred at the same time as other social and economic
transformations (industrialization, urbanization, globalization, etc.)
and at the same time as improvements in life expectancy and a large
number of disease outcomes. The &lsquo;received view&rsquo; of these
historical relations is that social and economic changes allowed the
growth of biomedicine, which in turn created new institutions,
professional health care practices, and technologies that, in turn,
caused vast improvements in health outcomes for the populations served
by biomedical institutions. Penicillin is the go-to example for
illustrating the positive health impacts of biomedicine (L&ouml;wy,
2011). It is a medicine extracted from nature (mold), made into a
widely available &lsquo;magic bullet&rsquo; thanks to biomedical
techniques of identifying its active components, and manufacturing
controlled doses of it at reasonable cost at massive scale. Suffering
and death from bacterial infections were rapidly alleviated; once
hopeless diseases were suddenly curable with a few benign pills.</p>

<h2 id="OntMetComBio">2. Ontological and Metaphysical Commitments in Biomedicine</h2>

<p>
Biomedicine is built around a conception of disease as a dysfunction
of particular physical parts (organs, tissues, cells) of the body.
Despite being hegemonic in the global research community,
biomedicine&rsquo;s ontological and metaphysical commitments are not
self-evident, historically long-lived, nor universally embraced.</p>

<h3 id="OntBodLifBio">2.1 Ontology of the body and life in biomedicine</h3>

<p>
What makes patients and their bodies special? Some philosophers of
biomedicine have attempted to make headway in this question by
provocatively asking what it means for biomedical sciences to be
&lsquo;chauvinist&rsquo; and whether this is proper. Biomedical
discussions are in large part defined by what they exclude from
discussion. Curiously, there are two sides to the coin of biological
chauvinism: one that directly supports the biomedical framework and
one that challenges it. Both help shed light on the relationship
between biology and medicine.</p>

<p>
Broadbent (2009) uses the helpful term, &ldquo;biological
chauvinism&rdquo; to describe the way that biomedicine actively
excludes consideration of entities and processes that don&rsquo;t fit
into its worldview: &ldquo;a refusal to countenance causes of ill
health that are not biological&rdquo; (Broadbent, 2009, p. 305).
Biological chauvinists might appeal to ontological or epistemic
commitments, e.g., the assumption that knowledge of the body is
nothing but knowledge of organic chemical processes, and any processes
not clearly reducible to such terms are not yet worthy of being given
full consideration. But the strongest case for this chauvinism rests
more on pragmatic grounds than on such philosophical assumptions.
Biomedicine has built itself into a massive global institution and
research enterprise while operating under that assumption (to repeat
Krieger&rsquo;s phrasing from Section 1.1, the assumption is that
&ldquo;the domain of disease and its causes is restricted to solely
biological, chemical, and physical phenomena&rdquo; (Krieger, 2011, p.
130)).</p>

<p>
On the other side of the coin, &ldquo;biochauvanism&rdquo; is the term
applied to the view that there is something philosophically unique
about biological organisms&mdash;due to their basic nature and/or the
limitations of human knowledge&rsquo;s access to them&mdash;that makes
them the biological world fundamentally unlike the rest of the world
(Wolfe, 2015). Vitalism and phenomenology (see Section 5) are two
examples for forms of biochauvinism. Thus there are two rather
opposite senses in which we can chauvinistically hold that the
biological world is special: 1) a specialness through what life
excludes (medicine is nothing but applied biology) or 2) a specialness
through what life includes (an intangible vital spirit; a unique frame
of time and space). Version (1) of biochauvinism is consistent with
biomedicine and version (2) generally is not. The fact that the
valorizing of biology can cut both ways helps to show, though, that
biomedicine has staked out a sort of middle ground by insisting that
understanding health and medicine is accomplished through
understanding the innumerable subtleties of biological processes and
substances, but that those biological processes and substances must
not be so subtle or mysterious as to become untethered from properties
and processes condoned by physics and chemistry.</p>

<p>
Put another way, the biomedical framework of the body can be
understood by considering what it excludes: spirit, vitality, and any
other entity or property unknown to mainstream physicists or chemists.
The concept
 <strong><a href="../physicalism/">physicalism</a>
 </strong> is closely related, but the term is perhaps not a perfect
fit since it has taken on conceptual connotations and baggage through
its use by analytic philosophers of metaphysics. The connection is
that in the psychological biosciences, the &ldquo;hard problem of
consciousness&rdquo; looms over everything: &ldquo;It is widely agreed
that experience arises from a physical basis, but we have no good
explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical
processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively
unreasonable that it should, and yet it does&rdquo; (Chalmers, 1995).
While the human mind and consciousness attract a special sense of awe,
the hard problem of consciousness is not all that different from the
problems facing attempts to make sense of the patient as a whole.
Patients live; their bodies function every second of the day, via an
astounding series of interconnected processes. It stretches the
imagination to think that a vital spirit or such is giving unity to
each life (human or non-); it stretches the imagination in another way
to think that we humans are simply skin bags of chemical
reactions.</p>

<h3 id="BioConHeaDis">2.2 Biomedical conceptions of health and disease</h3>

<p>
As Elizabeth Barnes puts it, &ldquo;[i]n a nutshell, the problem is
this: health is weird&hellip;We all care about health&mdash;our own
and others. But we don&rsquo;t know how to define it, how to quantify
it, or how to relate it to other familiar things we care about
(wellbeing, happiness, etc.).&rdquo; (Barnes, 2023, p. 2). The
preceding section on purpose in biomedicine leads directly to the
related issue of how health and disease are conceptualized in
biomedicine. This is something that will only be dealt with very
briefly here, in part to avoid duplicating the content in the entry on
 <a href="../health-disease/">concepts of health and disease</a>.
 Debates over the meaning of health and disease&mdash;including how
the two are connected&mdash;are central to philosophy of medicine.
This entry will not attempt to summarize that complex literature, and
rather focus on how conceptions of health and disease relate to
biomedicine, including related disputes over how disease relates to
disability justice matters, and ways in which purportedly objective
biomedical conceptions of disease can be coopted for dubious
purposes.</p>

<p>
Of the different philosophical accounts of health and disease,
Christopher Boorse&rsquo;s naturalistic Biostatistical Theory (BST) of
disease gives the account that is perhaps most tightly linked with the
philosophical commitments of biomedicine. Boorse&rsquo;s revised
account of the BST states:</p>

<blockquote>

<ol type="1">

<li>The <em>reference class</em> is a natural class of organisms of
uniform functional design; specifically, an age group of a sex of a
species.</li>

<li>A <em>normal function</em> of a part or process within members of
the reference class is a statistically typical contribution by it to
their individual survival [or] reproduction.</li>

<li><em>Health</em> in a member of the reference class is <em>normal
functional ability</em>: the readiness of each internal part to
perform all its normal functions on typical occasions with at least
typical efficiency.</li>

<li>A <em>disease</em> [later, <em>pathological condition</em>] is a
type of internal state which impairs health, <em>i.e.</em>, reduces
one or more functional abilities below typical efficiency (Boorse
2014: 684, amending Boorse 1977: 562).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea is that we can wield insights of biochemistry, pathology, and
evolutionary biology to together yield an objective means of
&lsquo;reading&rsquo; nature to tell us which states are pathological
or diseased states, without the interference of messy and culturally
rooted/biased evaluations. One line of rebuttal is that there is no
principled way of objectively choosing a reference class against which
to judge that a given part or process is falling short (my blood sugar
levels are objectively too high compared to&hellip;what exactly?)
(Kingma, 2014). Even if that problem is resolvable, Krueger argues
that an objective set of criteria for defining states as pathological
or not would be a very limited accomplishment. Knowing that my blood
sugar levels are objectively pathological does not really tell me much
about what, if anything I or my physician ought to do about that
(Krueger, 2015).</p>

<p>
Fraught as it is to approach health via the functioning of components
in the body, it is also quite conceptually difficult to measure health
in a broader sense. Biomedical science practitioners tend to get
twisted into conceptual and epistemic knots when attempting to measure
general/overall health or well-being in a population (Alexandrova
2017; Hausman, 2015) (see section 3.3 Epistemology of measurement in
biomedicine). One key philosophical dispute among health scientists
engaged in patient health measurement activities is over what
sorts/amounts of knowledge patients have about their own health
states, and how this knowledge ought to be accessed (McClimans, 2024).
How much can we glean about a patient&rsquo;s physical comfort by
asking them to rate their level of pain on a scale of 1&ndash;10? How
do we solicit such information without repeating unethical patterns of
trust or mistrust, rooted in racist/sexist/etc. stereotypes about
patients (Buchman, Ho, &amp; Goldberg, 2017)? In the case of
disability, ableist biases are pervasive, distorting the vital
communication channels between disabled patients and physicians
(Pe&ntilde;a-Guzm&aacute;n and Reynolds, 2019).</p>

<p>
The notion of disease as biological malfunction is also tied to a pair
of critiques of the &ldquo;medical model&rdquo; of disability and of
&ldquo;medical model&rdquo; of mental health. Both models are
criticized for reducing the complexities of disability or
psychological welfare to only the individual-level signs, symptoms,
and variables recognized by biomedicine (see:
 <a href="../disability/">disability: definitions and models</a>).
 As traced in Hogan&rsquo;s history of the concept, the medical model
is either critiqued as insufficiently attentive to other dimensions
(especially the social dynamics that drastically shape the relevant
health experiences) or oppressive (since the model empowers biomedical
experts to unilaterally dictate the disability/psychiatric categories,
relevant evidence, diagnoses, treatments, etc.) (Hogan, 2019). This is
in part a dispute over functioning since debates over normality,
difference, and pathology depend on whether/how we commit to the
notion that bodies or parts thereof have functions at all (Garson,
2019). If one&rsquo;s legs do not perform the function of walking, are
the legs pathological? Is the person with those legs inherently
diseased? Disabled? Worse off than if they had legs that could walk?
One solution is to simply throw out the notion of normal functioning
(Amundson, 2000). Another related option is to embrace pluralism in
the sense of accepting that the relationship between disability and
well-being or health is complex, variable, and highly dependent on
individual and social contingencies (Campbell &amp; Stramondo, 2017).
However, embracing pluralism is made more challenging by the fact that
what counts as a good or thriving life is a cultural construct
primarily shaped by non-disabled people&rsquo;s values. For example,
autistic people are surrounded by messages that autistic traits are
inherent deficits, messages that are posed as objective truths, but
that are in fact based on rigid expectations that people be
sufficiently productive within the capitalist social order (Chapman,
2023).</p>

<p>
One philosophical complication is that a naturalistic concept of
disease, like Boorse&rsquo;s, does not prevent social processes from
altering the standards and practices of how the boundaries of these
natural categories are drawn in practice. Chronic diseases such as
cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes have been targeted by drug
companies to not only create new treatments but to redraw the
boundaries between healthy vs. pathological, including boundary zones
such as &ldquo;prediabetes&rdquo; (Greene, 2006). These efforts are in
part accomplished via the design of clinical trials, which have the
dangerous distinction of having very high epistemic value in the
biomedical community, while remaining highly susceptible to
manipulations to the experimental setup that push the evidence one
direction or another (Gonz&aacute;lez-Moreno, Saborido, &amp; Teira,
2015).</p>

<p>
While a naturalistic concept of disease is the most consistent with
the ontological assumptions and methodological practices of
biomedicine, that has not prevented biomedicine from accommodating a
certain type of dissent from the biomedical tenet that biomedicine
ought to focus on diseases and (only) the biological, chemical, and
physical aspects thereof (Krieger, 2011, p. 130). The World Health
Organization (WHO)&mdash;founded in the same post-World War II period
as biomedicine&mdash;adopted a holistic positive concept of health at
its founding. I.e. it said that health is the presence of complete
well-being (including mental and social well-being) rather than just
the absence of disease. This created a direct tension with the core
tenets of biomedicine, especially the reduction of disease to a set of
concrete observable and measurable physical bases (Valles, 2018).
Historically, the tension was resolved in the case of the WHO by the
organization, shortly after its founding, effectively self-suppressing
the use of its own definition of health in favor of pursuing a
narrower set of initiatives to combat particular diseases (e.g., the
celebrated Smallpox Eradication Program) (Irwin &amp; Scali, 2007).
This seems to have been in part because cold war politics made it
pragmatic to not antagonize the United States with pushing a health
concept concerned with &ldquo;social&rdquo; well-being, sounding a bit
reminiscent of socialism (Irwin &amp; Scali, 2007). While a WHO-type
understanding of health is in genuine tension with the philosophical
tenets of biomedicine, the tension is manageable in this case by
simply pursuing areas of overlap between the different conceptions of
disease (e.g., investing in infectious disease-control strategies for
a population) while ignoring any purported aspects of health beyond
the absence of pathologies. WHO-type understanding of health is
declining to invest in assessing how human-environment relations
contribute to a population&rsquo;s misery, let alone its happiness and
pleasure (Cooper, 2019 ; Kantor &amp; Lindberg, 2020). This neglect
extends to investigating the potential of the environment as a source
of health (Malsch, Killin, &amp; Kaiser, 2024).</p>

<h2 id="EpiBio">3. Epistemology of Biomedicine</h2>

<p>
There are philosophical disputes happening at the heart of the
biomedical enterprise and those disputes offer a means of
understanding the epistemological dimensions of biomedicine: the
nature of evidence and knowledge in the framework. The most
contentious of those internal biomedicine disputes center on what the
epistemology of biomedicine ought to be, with the rise of
&ldquo;evidence-based medicine&rdquo; (EBM) being the event that
provoked the largest segment of these disputes. By examining the
disputes surrounding EBM, we can gain a better understanding of the
epistemology of biomedicine, as illustrated in work such as
Solomon&rsquo;s Making Medical Knowledge (Solomon, 2015).
Evidence-based medicine is a tricky concept, since its name
misleadingly raises the question of who is practicing medicine that is
not based on evidence (Goldenberg, 2006). Instead, the dispute is over
which evidence is best and how it ought to be used. For instance,
physicians will often advise patients on which home treatments to use
for minor lower back pain, with individual physicians varying in which
treatments they recommend, even aside from differences in the advice
based on differing patient characteristics. Ibuprofen? Acetaminophen?
Heat and/or cold compresses? Exercise? The standard twentieth-century
medical response would be to let physician groups (including consensus
groups convened for this purpose) lay out the options and perhaps use
their collective expertise to make a recommendation, but giving great
leeway to individual physicians to use their individual accumulated
expertise to choose another of the available options seen as viable
options by their peers. EBM instead treats this as a matter to be
largely decided by empirical research. I.e., we ought to run
randomized control trial experiments that compare the efficacy of
alternative options by randomly assigning patients with lower back
pain into Treatment A or Treatment B&mdash;controlling for the single
variable&mdash;and measure the effects on patients using predetermined
metrics (change in reported pain severity, incidence of major side
effects, etc.). After doing multiple experiments we can then do a
&ldquo;systematic review and meta-analysis&rdquo; that compiles the
data trends across parallel research studies and helps us build an
evidence base for creating guidelines for which treatment clinicians
ought to use. Those guidelines dictate the proper default practices,
which individual clinicians can contravene if specific individual
patient needs are in conflict (e.g. a patient history of not
responding well to a certain medication).</p>

<p>
EBM began as a self-described Kuhnian scientific revolution of
biomedicine&mdash;a fundamental change of worldview that is
incommensurable with the previous one; a paradigm shift
(Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group, 1992). The most fundamental
dispute between advocates of the EBM movement and skeptics within the
biomedical community is, in one sense, over the epistemic and power
relationships between the two halves of biomedicine: biology and
medicine. In biology, experimental methodologies and attempts to find
generalizable population trends are valued highly; in clinical
medicine, the single patient and the clinician&rsquo;s accumulated
(and ineffable) expert evaluation of them has long been valued very
highly&mdash;much attention is paid to that individual patient&rsquo;s
contingencies (the particulars of their body and symptoms), with the
clinician&rsquo;s accumulated knowledge and knowhow being relied on
when determining how to proceed. Evidence-based medicine is not a
simplistic adoption of biology principles and their application to
medicine; it is not the triumph of biology over medicine in
biomedicine. Instead, EBM has helped to draw out deeper disagreements
about what it means to do and use biomedical science well.</p>

<p>
There is a large philosophical literature on evidence-based medicine,
with the first monograph appearing in 2002 (Goodman, 2002). Most of
the literature takes at least a partially skeptical stance on EBM
practitioners&rsquo; various hardline stances on evidentiary matters:
the suitability of clinicians relying primarily on brief synopses that
attempt to synthesize massive bodies of evidence (Borgerson, 2009);
the room for hidden biases in the process of evaluating medical data
(Stegenga, 2011), and more. EBM has also inspired passionate disputes
among clinicians over how to apply its principles (Berwick, 2005;
Greenhalgh, Snow, Ryan, Rees, &amp; Salisbury, 2015). One line of
criticism is that its aims are noble, but have been hijacked by bad
actors, namely corporations that learned that by getting involved in
the production of randomized control trial evidence they could sway
the evidence for the apparent safety and efficacy of their own
products (Ioannidis, 2016). Philosophy of EBM is given extensive
discussion in the entry on
 <a href="../medicine/">philosophy of medicine</a>,
 and as with the rest of this entry, this entry will avoid needless
repetition and keep the focus on biomedicine per se. For an
introduction to the topic, see (Broadbent 2019).</p>

<h3 id="EpiExpExpCliDatBio">3.1 Epistemology of expertise and experimental clinical data in biomedicine</h3>

<p>
Biomedicine is in a state of tension, between</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>a history of resolving evidentiary disputes using mechanistic
reasoning, consensus, and authority (see, e.g., Solomon [2015] on the
roles played by &lsquo;consensus conferences&rsquo;) vs.</li>

<li>a recent practice of creating predetermined evidentiary
ranking/&#8203;evaluating procedures designed to minimize the ability
of biased or erratic human judgments to unduly influence the
resolution of evidentiary disputes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Clinical guidelines were once routinely created by what is
pejoratively called GOBSAT: Good Old Boys Sat Around A Table (and
reached a consensus by talking amongst themselves as leading experts
in the subject matter). As Greenhalgh puts it, &ldquo;it is a major
achievement of the EBM movement that almost no guideline these days is
produced by GOBSAT!&rdquo; (Greenhalgh, 2014, p. 7). It remains a
point of philosophical contention just how epistemically different it
is to generate clinical practice guidelines using a consensus-based
model vs. an evidence-based model, in large part since, no matter what
evidence is prioritized, a group of experts will ultimately need to
interpret the data and make judgement calls on how to generate
practical guidelines based on the compiled evidence (Djulbegovic &amp;
Guyatt, 2019). Though even the meaning of clinical expertise is itself
not clearly defined and agreed upon, a matter further complicated by
the way that the meaning of expertise is tangled up with views about
what roles expertise ought to be playing in clinical practice (Wieten,
2018). Debates over expertise and the valuing of different forms of
evidence are key to the proposed alternative frameworks seeking to
reform, replace, or coexist with biomedicine (see Section 5).</p>

<p>
Evidence-based medicine prizes certain types of biomedical
evidence&mdash;highly controlled and systematic evidence&mdash;more
highly than others. But that preference is a matter of much
contention. As noted above, experimental evidence from a randomized
experiment testing a treatment (a &ldquo;randomized control
trial&rdquo;) is held as the best sort of evidence: the gold standard.
The one exception is that &ldquo;meta-analyses&rdquo; of multiple
experimental studies are perhaps a platinum standard better than gold
(Stegenga, 2011). I.e. the thinking goes that the only evidence that
might be better than such experimental data is a rigorous quantitative
study rigorously looking for patterns and lessons by analyzing the
results of many rigorous experimental studies. While the rigidity of
EBM thinking gets a great deal of criticism, there are elements of the
EBM&rsquo;s philosophy that implement the sort of pragmatism that many
critics desire, such as an epistemic openness in the community to
engage in &ldquo;open-ended critical inquiry&rdquo; (Goldenberg,
2009).</p>

<h3 id="EpiBasAppSciBio">3.2 Epistemology of basic and applied science in biomedicine</h3>

<p>
The status of laboratory evidence is a major point of contention in
philosophy of biomedicine disputes. &ldquo;Bench science&rdquo; is
often used as a catchall term in EBM for a wide variety of laboratory
evidence (biochemistry, pathology, digital models of drug metabolism,
animal studies of a treatment, etc.), and that evidence is pushed to
the very bottom of the evidence hierarchy (B. Clarke, Gillies, Illari,
Russo, &amp; Williamson 2014). For example, green tea contains
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which seems to be effective at
killing cancer cells in petri dishes and in mice (Eisenstein 2019).
EBM supporters would be inclined to look down on inferences that green
tea is therefore a wise anti-cancer home health behavior, until there
is at least epidemiological evidence that green tea drinkers genuinely
do have better cancer outcomes. Even then, EBM supporters would want
to know if the anti-cancer effects are due to EGCG, some combination
of multiple components of green tea, or perhaps just the relaxing
social act of having a hot beverage. Biomedicine has always valued the
sort of research that investigates EGCG in petri dishes, in mice, or
other models used on the laboratory bench, but the dispute is over how
reliable one takes that research to be for guiding real medical
decisions (ought physicians tell patients to drink green tea?).</p>

<p>
The problem of how highly to value bench science is distinct from the
general objection to hierarchies of evidence (Bluhm, 2005). Even if
evidence isn&rsquo;t treated as inherently rankable in value, one key
philosophical objection is that much of the biomedical research world
is treated by EBM as less important than clinical patient experiments,
or meta-analyses of such experimental data. Solomon explains that this
position is in tension with a simultaneous trend in biomedicine, an
increased concern with translational medicine (an effort to improve
the process of moving candidate treatments from (the laboratory) bench
to (the patient&rsquo;s) bedside (Solomon, 2011). This effort to
better manage the biomedical research enterprise has brought with
it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a restoration of the recognition that clinical research requires an
engagement with basic theory (e.g., physiological, genetic,
biochemical) and a range of empirical techniques such as bedside
observation, laboratory and animal studies. (Solomon 2011: 451)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In an openly conciliatory move, the &ldquo;EBM+&rdquo; group of
philosophers and clinicians (see
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Sources</a>),
 offers a defense of the view that mainstream EBM has erred by
essentially relegating mechanistic evidence, such as EGCG having
anti-cancer chemical properties, to a subsidiary role (B. Clarke et
al. 2014).</p>

<h3 id="EpiMeaBio">3.3 Epistemology of measurement in biomedicine</h3>

<p>
While epidemiology-focused EBM is partly in tension with most of the
rest of laboratory-focused biomedicine&mdash;needing it but seeing it
as in service to randomized control trials on patients&mdash;both EBM
and other branches of biomedicine are united by a valuing of precise
measurement. While precise measurement is achievable in the
biochemistry lab, the practical and philosophical challenges are
thornier when doing measurement at the level of the whole person or
the population. What is well-being (Alexandrova, 2017)? By what
standards can we call a population healthy (Hausman, 2015)? What sorts
of social structures, policies, and interventions are effective for
promoting health (Valles, 2018)? How do we identify which subgroups
are left out of the benefits and prevent injustices being done to them
(Maglo, 2010, 2012)? What sorts of values are at stake when we debate
biomedical evidence surrounding cultural issues such as birthing
practices (McClimans, 2015)? A common theme shared by these critiques
is a concern about the fickleness and contingency of measurement
leaving much room for practitioners&rsquo; values and motivations to
shape the results of the measurement process, for good or for ill
(Keuck 2024; Tal 2024; see also
 <a href="../measurement-science/">Measurement in Science</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The biomedical quest for precise and objective measurements leaves
some unsatisfied with the little room left for patient input in
clinical care decision-making. What roles are there for patient input
in the process of deciding the best course of treatment
(Chin&#8208;Yee &amp; Upshur, 2018)? According to critiques, by trying
to sideline subjective factors in medical care and replace them with
increasingly objective factors, EBM especially (even among than other
biomedical perspectives), risks losing the humanistic aspects of
medicine, an ethical loss and an epistemic loss (See also, section 5.1
on humanistic medicine). By treating patients&rsquo; desires, goals,
and values as largely irrelevant or a source of interference with an
objective process, EBM loses sight of medicine as a means of helping
real humans&rsquo; real problems. Relatedly, when healthcare decisions
exclude patients' perspectives, the very concept of 'best treatment'
loses its meaning. Even if a medical intervention achieves
biologically optimal results, it cannot be considered truly successful
if the patient experiences the outcome as diminished quality of life
(McClimans, 2024).</p>

<p>
In the background is the important&mdash;and
meta-epistemic&mdash;problem that physicians struggle with
uncertainty, and what to do in an objective measurement-focused field
when one finds oneself lacking the desired evidence: inconclusive
tests, treatments designed for patients unlike the one being treated,
etc. Medical education has been criticized as inadequately preparing
future physicians for the challenges of medical uncertainty (Mark R
Tonelli &amp; Upshur, 2019).</p>

<h3 id="RedEpiBio">3.4 Reductionism in epistemology of biomedicine</h3>

<p>
In biomedicine, it appears much of medicine is reduced to applied
biology&mdash;patients are just biochemical processes and medical
knowledge is just a complicated form of biological knowledge. Keating
and Cambrosio see the relationship between this reductionism in
biomedicine (the reducing of medicine to biology) as more a matter of
the two being aligned for complex historical and philosophical
reasons, instead of that reductionism being philosophically central to
biomedicine (Keating et al., 2003). According to them, after World War
II, the fields of biology and pathology negotiated the creation of
&ldquo;the institutional and epistemic hybrid we call
biomedicine,&rdquo; and neither component of this hybrid rules the
other (Keating et al., 2003, p. 368). They see this as undermining
claims of biomedicine being reductionist because such assertions
implicitly or explicitly mean that (micro)biology gets epistemic
priority because it is the true and stable foundation.</p>

<p>
Part of the challenge is that there are multiple varieties of
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>.
 And there are a number of different reductionism disputes in biology,
and the overlaps with biomedicine vary&mdash;e.g., Rosenberg&rsquo;s
defense of reductionism in genetics overlaps with biomedicine in the
area of medical genetics (Rosenberg 2006). As discussed in
 <a href="#BioFraForMedBio">Section 1</a>,
 it is very difficult to tell the difference between the core
components of biomedicine and the bits of
philosophy/technology/sociology that aren&rsquo;t inherently part of
biomedicine, but have gotten tangled up in it. The rationale for
reductionism in biomedicine is explained with great care by
Andersen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Being able to successfully take a disease as complex as sickle cell
anemia or Parkinson&rsquo;s and reduce it to a single genetic error
that cascades through various systems, even if that reduction holds
for only a proper subset of cases, illustrates that reduction can be a
powerful tool for research and explanation in medicine. It cannot be
the only tool in the toolkit, since some diseases or dysfunctions may
be only partially reducible, or for which only some cases are
reducible. But it is a good working assumption, as Oppenheim and
Putnam put it, in tackling a problem with an unknown etiology, to look
for ways to reduce it to a few or even a single causal driver at a
molecular level (Andersen 2016: 86).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, the potential for success and record of prior
successes is an argument for at least operating under the assumption
that biomedical scholars ought to continue treating biomedical
mysteries as biochemical puzzles for which the relevant pieces have
not yet been identified or assembled. This critique offers a reply to
the Krieger&rsquo;s first tenet of biomedicine (See Section 1.1), the
focus on biochemical processes. By contrast, other critics have been
more concerned with the third tenet, the view of the body as a
composite of distinct parts, rather than a unified whole.</p>

<p>
Reductionism in biomedicine has been targeted by some committed
critics. For instance, Marcum explains that the process of reducing
the body to such component parts yields a vision of the body as
machine, a radically dehumanizing move.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
From the biomechanical point of view, the patient&rsquo;s body is
often perceived as a material object that can be reduced to a system
of physical parts. That body is viewed as a machine composed of
individual body parts, which can be fixed or exchanged with new parts,
when broken. By reducing the patient&rsquo;s body to an assemblage of
body parts, the patient <em>qua</em> person vanishes (Marcum 2005:
318).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While the critique stands on its own, it remains an open question what
other view ought to be adopted if not a reductionist biomechanical
one. Marcum contrasts the view most directly to phenomenological
views&mdash;which will be discussed in Section 5&mdash;arguing that a
phenomenological approach is better suited to advancing medicine,
which he presents as being in a state of crisis.</p>

<p>
EBM&rsquo;s reliance on randomized controlled trials as a cornerstone
of health data collection doubles down on the general reductionism of
biomedicine. Randomized controlled trials assume that health variables
can be observed, manipulated and controlled as largely independent
units. Yet, is a well-established problem that we simply don&rsquo;t
know all of the variables that might confound a clinical experiment
(Worrall, 2007), so randomization can at most hope that the
&lsquo;confounders&rsquo; (e.g. unknown dietary factors that affect
metabolization of a drug) are randomly distributed between the
different treatment populations in an experiment. Taking the
reductionism a step further, the goal of exactly measuring the
differences between Treatment A and Treatment B requires EBM to only
look for effects that are precisely measurable in the first place.
This limitation is a deeply-rooted problem since even the official
list of clinical signs and symptoms of a given disease can diverge
from accumulated patient observations, and in cases such as some
psychiatric conditions, the symptoms&mdash;or lack thereof&mdash;are
overtly difficult to measure or factor into an assessment of treatment
efficacy (e.g. one&rsquo;s sense of self and/or emotional life)
(Kendler, 2016).</p>

<p>
While reductionist and antireductionist approaches are in direct
opposition, it is possible to take a pluralistic stance toward them:
both can be welcomed into health science. For instance, this is the
position taken by Campaner (Campaner, 2010). Though, as discussed in
the next section, the power of the biomedical institution makes it
such that biomechanical reductionist approaches can easily overwhelm
alternative views, which can lead to epistemic injustice and reduced
health.</p>

<h3 id="EpiInjBio">3.5 Epistemic injustice in biomedicine</h3>

<p>
Epistemic injustice is a set of conceptual tools used to analyze the
harm done to individuals and communities in their capacity as knowers,
as well as the effects of these harms on knowledge development and
societal ignorance and silencing (see also
 <a href="../epistemology-social/#MoraSociEpis">social epistemology</a>
 and
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/#EpiInj">feminist social epistemology</a>).
 The sources of epistemic injustice can be individual or institutional
bias (Fricker, 2007) or structural to the epistemic system itself,
with historical contingencies (Dotson, 2011; 2012; 2014). Two central
forms of epistemic injustice have been discussed in the biomedical
context: testimonial and hermeneutical injustices (Fricker, 2007).
Fricker argues that testimonial injustice &ldquo;occurs when prejudice
causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's
word&rdquo; while hermeneutical injustice occurs &ldquo;when a gap in
collective interpretive resources puts someone at an unfair
disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social
experiences&rdquo; (Fricker, 2007, p.1). Over time, these concepts
have been expanded and have become more nuanced (e.g., Hookway, 2010;
Kukla, 2014; Mason, 2011; Medina, 2017; Wanderer, 2017). In the
context of health, epistemic injustice has been attributed to
biomedicine's epistemic commitments, which often prioritize narrow,
reductionist perspectives. Institutional practices, policies, and
dynamics can contribute to deepening health inequalities and, as such,
to increased epistemic injustice. See Section 4 on Biomedicine as an
Institution.</p>

<p>
Testimonial and hermeneutical injustice have been discussed in the
medical context in relation to classification, diagnosis, and
treatment of maladies and healthcare allocation. Among the vulnerable
populations who suffer from testimonial injustice are immigrants
(Casta&ntilde;eda, 2022), children (Carel &amp; Gy&ouml;rffy, 2014),
patients with specific psychiatric conditions, young psychiatric
patients, patients with psychiatric-somatic comorbidity (Bueter, 2021;
Bortolotti, 2025), and the disabled (Pe&ntilde;a-Guzm&aacute;n &amp;
Reynolds, 2019). Hermeneutical injustice has been discussed in the
context of psychiatry and neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., Bueter,
2019; Chapman &amp; Carel, 2022; Dro&#380;d&#380;owicz, 2021;
Ritunnano, 2022; Spencer, 2023; Spencer, &amp; Kidd, 2023; Bortolotti,
2025), phenomenology of illness (Kidd &amp; Carel, 2017, 2018), and
medicalization (Wardrope, 2015), to name a few. In addition, the
negative experiences of the ill that arise from the epistemic
prejudices and hermeneutical difficulties within healthcare and in
society were also labelled by Kidd and Carel (Kidd &amp; Carel, 2019)
as &lsquo;pathocentric epistemic injustice&rsquo;. Furthermore,
specific forms of epistemic injustice in the medical context were
identified. These forms include epistemically unjust concepts of
disease/disorders and health (Kidd &amp; Carel, 2019), hermeneutical
death (Medina, 2017), preemptive testimonial injustice (Bueter, 2019),
or wrongful depathologization (Spencer &amp; Carel, 2021).</p>

<p>
To address epistemic injustice in biomedicine, it is essential to
foster inclusivity, value diverse perspectives, and reform
institutional structures to meet the needs of all patients. However,
the use of epistemic injustice has also raised descriptive and
normative challenges of inclusion of experiential knowledge in the
contexts of mental health care (Dings &amp; Strijbos, 2025) and
worries that an imbalanced approach impedes legitimate and potentially
valuable inquiry of unexplained illness (e.g., chronic Fatigue
syndrome) (Byrne, 2020). While the concept of epistemic injustice is
receiving increasing philosophical attention, the concept of epistemic
justice still lacks philosophical depth (Kidd, Spencer, &amp; Carel,
2023; C&ocirc;t&eacute;, 2024).</p>

<h2 id="BioIns">4. Biomedicine as an Institution</h2>

<h3 id="BioColPow">4.1 Biomedicine and colonial power</h3>

<p>
The disputes over biomedicine&rsquo;s virtues and flaws are tied to
the other aspects of Western cultural-political-economic influence
that coevolved with it, and travelled with it around the globe. The
dynamics between the institution of biomedicine&mdash;rooted in
wealthy Western countries&mdash;and low/middle-income countries is in
part a manifestation of the complexities of the international
political scene. See, for instance, the literature on
 <a href="../international-justice/">international distributive justice</a>.</p>
 
<p>
As discussed in Section 1.2, biomedicine co-evolved with the
West&rsquo;s social and economic institutions in the aftermath of
World War II. Of particular importance, the individualism of Western
capitalism has meshed with biomedicine&rsquo;s ontological view of the
body as effectively separable from its social context. Briggs and
Hallin describe how contemporary media and biomedicine work to
coproduce public knowledge about health and disease, a process they
dub biomediatization (Briggs &amp; Hallin, 2016).</p>

<p>
Biomedicine has been used as one prong of colonial power dynamics
between Western institutions and non-Western peoples (including
indigenous peoples) (see: (Millum &amp; Emanuel, 2012)). Colonial
governments&rsquo; overt policies (e.g. medical licensing standards)
and subtler cultural imperialism (e.g. media depictions of traditional
healers as frauds or fools) have long undermined or directly attacked
local/indigenous medical frameworks and institutions. And since
biomedical education and practice are based on technologies and
education from the West, low- and middle-income countries are left
dependent on wealthy Western countries (Nunn, 2009). As a result,
local would-be biomedical practitioners often travel to the West for
biomedical education and then have little incentive to return to their
home countries to practice techniques for which they will have
relatively few biomedical tools, lower pay, etc. This raises further
ethical questions related to which entities have which
individual/collective responsibilities to address this so-called
&lsquo;brain drain&rsquo; trend (Yuksekdag, 2020). Meanwhile,
non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross offer medical
aid, but generally in the form of sending temporary trained personnel
from the West, rather than building sustainable local capacity for
medical training and practice. And well-meaning Western biomedical
students travel to the same low- and middle-income countries, with
limited knowledge of the populations or their health needs, a lack of
preparation that can be harmful (Pinto &amp; Upshur, 2009).</p>

<h3 id="Bio">4.2 Biomedicalization</h3>

<p>
To grasp the concept of biomedicalization, it is crucial to explore
its roots in critical social analysis and the concept of
medicalization. Medicalization describes the expansion of medical
jurisdiction over phenomena that were not considered medical before.
Medicalization occurs when aspects of life are defined as medical
conditions that should receive medical attention. Traditionally,
&lsquo;medicalization&rsquo; has been used mainly with a negative
connotation, to describe problematic processes. In recent years it has
been used as a neutral or descriptive term (Kukla, 2022; Rose, 2007;
Sadler, Jotterand, Lee, &amp; Inrig, 2009) &ndash;similarly to
&lsquo;scientific imperialism&rsquo; &ndash;with
&lsquo;over-medicalization&rsquo; being used to describe undesirable
processes.</p>

<p>
The contemporary anti-medicalization stance is historically rooted in
the
 <a href="../mental-disorder/#AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">anti-psychiatry movement</a>
 and has been reinforced by the feminist, anti-racist, and LGBT
movements (see for example the cases of homosexuality and drapetomania
in
 <a href="../health-disease/">Concepts of Health and Disease</a>).
 Anti-psychiatry drew awareness to the power structures involved in
pathologizing oppressed groups and the surveillance power of medical
institutions (Hagner, 2003).
 <a href="../foucault/">Michel Foucault</a>&rsquo;s
 famous work on madness is critical of how society has treated those
deemed &ldquo;mad&rdquo; (M Foucault, 1967). Foucault argues that the
treatment of the mad reflects broader power dynamics and social
control mechanisms, and it is often oppressive and dehumanizing. Thoms
Szasz&rsquo;s (T. Szasz, 2007; T. S. Szasz, 1960) argument that mental
illness is a metaphor and not an actual natural condition, is also
central to the anti-psychiatry critique.</p>

<p>
The anti-medicalization stance expanded beyond psychiatry, finding
similar problems in other areas of medicine. In Foucault&rsquo;s
historical works The Birth of the Clinic (M Foucault, 2012 [1963]) and
The history of sexuality (Michel Foucault, 1990 [1976]) he highlights
aspects of (bio)medicine: dehumanization, reductionism, measurement
and observation methods of dubious value, and the problem of the
medical institutional power (bio-power) that controls and oppressively
surveils the population. Foucault's work shows that the process of
medicalization was closely intertwined with the development of modern
capitalism and state power. This criticism of medicine as an
institution has been reinforced by the prominent work of sociologists
Irving Kenneth Zola (Zola, 1976) and Peter Conard (Conrad, 1975) and
in the social critic of Ivan Illich. In Medical Nemesis (Ilich, 1974),
Illich&rsquo;s influential critique of medicine, he argues that
(bio)medicine both has the wrong goals (he valorizes death, disease,
and pain as proper components of the human experience, rather than
enemies to be automatically and constantly opposed) and fails to
fulfill its own goals (iatrogenic disease&mdash;harms caused by
medical treatment&mdash;are a large component). Examples of recent
debates on (over)medicalization include pregnancy and childbirth,
disability (Pe&ntilde;a-Guzm&aacute;n &amp; Reynolds, 2019), Gender
dysphoria (Butler, 2004), grief (Solomon, 2021).</p>

<p>
In addition, the debate on (over) medicalization also refers to
conditions that are framed as biomedical and are treated at the
individual level, but are arguably social and systematic problems,
such as the debate on alcoholism (Midanik, 2004) and excited delirium
(Fischer &amp; Jukola, 2024). Similarly, philosophers have criticized
the genetic focus of biomedicine as a distraction from environmental
and social problems (Tabery, 2023).</p>

<p>
Traditionally, critiques of over-medicalization undermine the
understanding of aspects of human biology (e.g. feeling sadness during
grief) as states of illness, and calls for removing them from medical
jurisdiction. However, in recent years, this debate has expanded from
the sick role to preventive medicine, including association with risk
groups and the preservation of health (what is known as
salutogenesis). While identifying a risk factor for a disease can
prevent the disease, it can also lead to overdiagnosis. While
overdiagnosis differs from medicalization (Hofmann, 2016), both are
matters of concern in which medicine harms instead of helps, by
excessively intruding in human life. Together with health
preservation, we see that the social and ethical worries associated
with biomedicine as an institution of surveillance and control are not
restricted to what counts as a disease. So, while over-medicalization
is one avenue for criticizing biomedical institutions, the
surveillance and control exercised by biomedicine as an institution
occurs through multiple avenues.</p>

<p>
Kukla (2022) argues that conceptual resources are controlled by
dominant and hegemonic groups, which also leads to the concern that
the concept of health can be used against subgroups in a society.
Metzl and Kirkland&rsquo;s influential edited volume Against Health:
How Health Became the New Morality lays out a related case for how
biomedicine exercised undue influence over culture, including casting
health ills as personal failings deserving of public shaming and
stigmatization (Metzl &amp; Kirkland, 2010). As an illustration of the
sort of stigmatizing strategies that they condemn as unacceptable,
bioethicist Daniel Callahan ethically endorsed the social practice of
&lsquo;fat shaming&rsquo; as a means of promoting public health
(Callahan, 2016). Empirical arguments on the harms of stigmatization
(Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, &amp; Link, 2013), and contrary ethical
arguments (Dean, 2018), both rebut stigma as an ethically viable
health-promoting intervention. Health/body stigma, public rhetoric
over health, and moralism about health behaviors are all subjected to
scrutiny in critiques of &lsquo;self-care&rsquo; strategies, e.g.
telling &lsquo;overweight&rsquo;/overtired/overworked employees
feeling stressed by their jobs that they should take better care of
themselves by doing yoga, more closely monitoring their eating at
work, etc. The critique is that the biomedical model can recast social
problems (including outright abuses&mdash;usually capitalist ones) as
individual responsibilities. Self-care can go well when it empowers,
such as the Women&rsquo;s Health Movement of the 1960s and 1970s that
fought against sexism by calling upon women to know their own bodies
and value that knowledge (Bueter, 2017). Or self-care can become
regressive when it becomes &ldquo;inner-directed, authoritarian,
victim-blaming, manipulated by dominant forces, or diversionary from
struggles for radical change in both medicine and the broader
society&rdquo; (Sidel &amp; Sidel, 1981, p. 656).</p>

<p>
The growing emphasis on health and the development of risk and
surveillance-based medicine is considered one of the five key
processes that influence the development, and are shaped by, what
Clarke et al. (2003) call &ldquo;biomedicalization.&rdquo; Clarke et
al. define biomedicalization as the integration of technoscientific
innovation (Latour, 1987) into medicine since about 1985. As Clarke et
al. explain, &ldquo;a new focus on health and risk and surveillance
biomedicines&rdquo; is one of the five key processes of
biomedicalization: &ldquo;Biomedicalization is co-constituted through
five central (and overlapping) processes: major political economic
shifts; [...] the technoscientization of biomedicine; transformations
of the production, distribution, and consumption of biomedical
knowledges; and transformations of bodies and identities. We emphasize
historical developments in the transitional and current
biomedicalization era&rdquo; (Clarke et al. 1985, p. 166). While
biomedicalization has not been largely embraced as a critical concept,
the concept of medicalization is still persistence in philosophical
work concerning biomedicine, displaying the longer roots to many of
the epistemic commitments identified to biomedicine. To repeat the
point made in Section 1, &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; and
&ldquo;biomedicine&rdquo; are often used interchangeably. It is not
clear why biomedicalization has received so little explicit attention,
given that many critiques of medicalization target core features of
biomedicine.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers have critically examined the limitations of this
framework as a tool for analyzing contemporary health issues. Building
on Nikolas Rose's critique in &ldquo;Beyond Medicalization,&rdquo;
where he contends that &ldquo;medicalization has become a
clich&eacute; of critical social analysis&rdquo; (Rose, 2007, p. 700),
Bell and Figert (2015) call for a move beyond the repetitive revision
of &ldquo;-ization&rdquo; frameworks, which they see as inherently
limited in scope. Bell and Figert argue that &ldquo;-ization&rdquo;
discourses often prioritize individual-level explanations and
solutions, therefore obscuring the systemic and global dimensions of
health inequities. Alternatively, they advocate for a broader approach
that embraces the complexity of health disparities and integrates
insights from multiple fields to address the structural and social
determinants of health.</p>

<p>
An example of such an approach could be found in the work of Keating
and Cambrosio (Keating &amp; Cambrosio, 2003), who suggest analyzing
the new configuration between medicine, biology, and technology as
&lsquo;biomedical platforms.&rsquo; A biomedical platform is a way of
arranging instruments, individuals, and programs. By entering the
high-tech domains, biomedical platforms generate both innovation and
routines, creating a new alignment between the normal and the
pathological (Keating &amp; Cambrosio, 2003). A prominent example of a
biomedical platform is the genomics platform that enables the
sequencing and analysis of DNA profiles and generates genetic
biomarkers. These are used for disease treatment and health
preservation. Biomedical platforms could be seen as a more
encompassing framework than biomedicalization, and can be used to
conduct a critical analysis of biomedicine.</p>

<h3 id="BioPolDecMakCasCOV19">4.3 Biomedical policy and decision-making: the case of COVID-19</h3>

<p>
The arrival of the global COVID-19 pandemic serves as an illustration
of the powers and limitations of the biomedical institutions that have
been built up since the mid-20th century. Biomedical institutions
responded to a new pathogen by making use of its three epistemological
tenets identified by Krieger (See Section 1.1): 1) that the pandemic
is fundamentally a biological phenomenon, with normative and
sociopolitical aspects being incidental non-scientific considerations
separable from the core problem, 2) that the new viral pathogen is a
problem that needs to be identified and distilled down using the tools
of the laboratory, and 3) that a (properly reductionist) understanding
of the new disease is to be found in the laboratory, and similarly for
any solution to the problems created by the disease.</p>

<p>
Just two months after the online publication of the genetic sequence
data of the virus that came to be called severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the American biotech company
Moderna had designed a new vaccine for it. The design process of the
vaccine itself took only two days, and initial tests of the vaccine in
humans started two months later. It was so incredibly fast a process
because the company had access to a flexible vaccine template based on
messenger RNA. Within a year of the vaccine being isolated and
sequenced, the first mass vaccination campaigns had begun, with
several vaccines becoming available in quick succession. Yet the
conceptualization of COVID-19 mitigation as a biomedical challenge led
to the sidelining of other forms of knowledge, particularly social
scientific knowledge, such as economics (e.g. how housing and labor
conditions affect COVID-19 dynamics) (Lohse and Canali, 2021).
Moreover, biomedicine&rsquo;s prioritizing of experimental evidence,
preferably from randomized control trials, led to expert disputes over
what counts as a sufficient scientific evidence basis for promoting
widespread mask-wearing. Mechanistic evidence about virus size and
mask filtration capabilities pointed to masks being an effective tool,
but many experts demanded that more extensive experimental evidence be
acquired before promoting widespread mask-wearing (Muller, 2021).
These disputes connected with wider social and cultural debates over
masking.</p>

<p>
The US capitalized on longstanding ties between governmental entities,
including the biomedical funding powerhouse National Institutes of
Health, and the private pharmaceutical industry, providing virtually
unlimited funds to accelerate the development of the vaccines.
Worldwide, &ldquo;vaccine nationalism&rdquo; took hold, with the US
and other high-income countries snapping up doses of vaccines through
bulk contracts with pharmaceutical companies, leaving residents of
low- and middle-income countries with a paltry number of donated doses
(Collste 2022). Within high-income countries, widespread hesitancy to
taking the vaccines moved debates over vaccine hesitancy from focusing
on children to newly focusing on adults. Trust in science&mdash;more
specifically the biomedical branch of science&mdash;became the new
point of dispute. What is the nature of mistrust in vaccines (de
Melo-Martin 2022)? Is more trust warranted (Goldenberg 2021)? Ethical
critiques of vaccine hesitant people can be unethical themselves (see
Section 3.4 on Epistemic Injustice) (Cassam, 2021). Trust in official
vaccine guidelines is intertwined with trust in government (Jasanoff
et al., 2021).</p>

<h2 id="AltFra">5. Alternative Frameworks</h2>

<p>
Biomedicine is not the only framework for understanding health and
medicine. There are a range of alternatives, from traditional medicine
frameworks that predate biomedicine to biomedically-based systems that
seek to improve biomedicine incrementally. It is a matter of open
debate how much any one of these systems is commensurable with
biomedicine&rsquo;s core set of epistemological commitments and
institutional structures (specialty-based hospital hierarchies,
etc.).</p>

<h3 id="HumMed">5.1 Humanistic Medicine</h3>

<p>
Humanistic medicine is both a theory (Bolton, 2020; Cassell, 2004,
2012; Marcum, 2008; Robinson, 1939; Woods, 2017) and a set of values
and practices. In the heart of humanistic medicine is the patient as a
person, and its agency.</p>

<p>
Among the numerous humanistic critiques of biomedicine, coming from
the broad field of medical humanities (for an overview, see: Marcum,
2008), philosophers have paid particular attention to narrative and
phenomenology (Ferry-Danini 2018).</p>

<p>
Narrative medicine offers a revision to the biomedical model
alternative based around the centrality of the story or narrative in
human life (Charon, 2008). This notion that narrative is central to
human experience offers a variety of potential operationalizations in
clinical biomedical practice. For instance, it places additional value
on the patient consultation and asks for improved active listening
skills among clinicians, who must learn to elicit, receive, and
understand patients&rsquo; stories about their health conditions. Such
listening has many potential benefits, including the potential to
understand the meaning(s) of what human dignity means for a given
patient, an important benefit given that biomedical settings are known
for being &ldquo;dehumanizing&rdquo; (Parsons &amp; Hooker, 2010).
Though, the proposition that humans are indeed narrative beings has
itself been disputed (Woods, 2011). In addition, the construction of
one&rsquo;s own narrative is already done through biomedical
narratives, and therefore not entirely independent of them (Laforest,
2020). The variability among people underscores a broader imperative:
both narrative and biomedical models must resist one-size-fits-all
assumptions.</p>

<p>
The Biopsychosocial model (Engel, 1977, 1978, 1980) provides an
alternative to the biomedical model that only looks for the biological
causes for disease by giving account to the psychology of the patient
and its social environment. However, the Biopsychosocial model is
still focused on a (naturalistic) understanding of disease and lacks
agential recognition (Bolton, 2020; Bolton &amp; Gillett, 2019). As
such, it does not fulfill the phenomenologists' requirement of taking
illness seriously (Carel, 2016). The gap between the third-person
perspective and the subjective first-person perspective on illness is
captured by Svenaeus (2019) in his defense of phenomenological account
of health and illness. There, he argues that a person&rsquo;s
feelings, everyday life, and life story &ldquo;needs to be taken into
account in its own right&rdquo; (Svenaeus, 2019, p. 465). A new
variation of the Biopsychosocial model suggests to incorporate
agential recognition (Bolton &amp; Gillett, 2019), however, this model
is still not in use in medical practice.</p>

<p>
The growing awareness of the importance of recognizing the patient as
a person and an autonomous agent led to the growth of
&ldquo;patient-centered care&rdquo;. The patient-centered care
approach, refocuses attention on the patient instead of their disease
(El-Alti, Sandman, &amp; Munthe, 2019; Hanemaayer, 2021; Marcum,
2021). As such, it promotes patient empowerment and participation in
decision-making and focuses on tailoring care to individual patient
needs. Patient-centered care and values of participation and
personalization are also common in other initiatives, such as
personalized medicine (known also as precision medicine, and P4
medicine).</p>

<p>
Personalized medicine is often presented as an alternative to
&ldquo;one-size-fits-all medicine&rdquo; approach of
 <a href="../medicine/#RandContTriaEvidBaseMedi">Evidence-Based Medicine</a>.
 Personalized medicine describes itself as a holistic initiative,
partially because it aims at including the patient as a person (Vogt,
Hofmann, &amp; Getz, 2016); however, so far, it is not fulfilling its
holistic promise (Vogt, Ulvestad, Eriksen, &amp; Getz, 2014).
Personalized medicine&rsquo;s manifestation of patients&rsquo;
participation in their own medical care has been criticized as very
limited. Personalized medicine instead focuses mainly on compiling and
using more precise data, in processes that are driven by economic and
political interests, rarely benefitting the patients themselves
(Prainsack, 2017).</p>

<p>
Personalized medicine creates limited new patient participation roles
via increasing use of tracking technologies, like wearables. While
they allow greater autonomy for some people, they have a potential to
harm users&rsquo; substantive relational autonomy by manipulating
their decisions and behaviors for the benefit of businesses (e.g.
employers seeking to control workers' health) (Owens &amp; Cribb,
2019), and contribute to commodifying the surveillance of bodies
(Svenaeus, 2023). In addition, the gap between the user and its
&lsquo;quantified self&rsquo; (Lupton, 2016a, 2016b), can create
alienation of the user from their body, generate anxiety and
data-doubt (Lomborg, Langstrup, &amp; Andersen, 2020), and change
illness experience and symptoms formation (Hofmann &amp; Svenaeus,
2018). As a result of these changes, tracking technologies can affect
the epistemic division of labor between the different actors in the
medical realm (Friedman, 2024). Patient participation via the use of
tracking technologies also puts more responsibility on the patients
(or users) for their condition. In recent discourse, in which the
problem of stress has garnered increased attention, &ldquo;controlling
the health problems associated with living in stressful situations
therefore becomes the responsibility of the individuals&mdash;all too
often, the responsibility of individuals who are already disadvantaged
by their economic status, their race, or their social position more
generally&rdquo; (Kaplan, 2019, p. 116). Instead of focusing on and
intervening in the social determinants of health and disease,
Personalized medicine imposes new burdensome responsibilities on the
already-vulnerable.</p>

<p>
That is to say, although some alternative initiatives and frameworks
share values with humanistic medicine in their vision, they are, in
practice, offshoots of biomedicine more than they are alternative
frameworks that would replace biomedicine.</p>

<h3 id="GenMed">5.2 Gentle medicine</h3>

<p>
Stegenga has argued in favor of &ldquo;gentle medicine,&rdquo; a
conservative treatment mindset that stands in contrast to the
biomedical pursuit of ever-more interventions (Stegenga, 2018)&mdash;a
pill for each ailment. This is in one sense a challenge to biomedicine
more in quantity than in quality; he does not advocate for switching
from pills to naturopathic diet-based treatments. He recommends this
(purportedly gentler) conservatism as a response to an epistemic
devaluing of biomedicine knowledge which he calls: &ldquo;medical
nihilism&hellip;the view that we should have little confidence in the
effectiveness of medical interventions&rdquo; (Stegenga, 2018, p. 1).
This follows in the loose tradition of other writings, such as the
text by Illich discussed at the start of Section 5 (Illich, 1976); see
also Section 4.2 on anti-medicalization. But Stegenga&rsquo;s critique
and replacement remain a radical challenge to biomedicine in the sense
that it undercuts the epistemic practices of biomedicine and pushes
back on the institutional practices (and the related infrastructure,
including massive pharmaceutical companies) by arguing that
(bio)medical treatments ought to be applied sparingly.</p>

<h3 id="PopHeaFra">5.3 The population health framework</h3>

<p>
Valles offers an alternative&mdash;the population health
framework&mdash;that partly meshes with Stegenga&rsquo;s concluding
suggestion that &ldquo;gentle medicine&rdquo; ought to be accompanied
by interventions that refocus health promotion efforts on social
determinants of health, including &ldquo;clean drinking water, better
nutrition, and greater socio-economic equality&rdquo; (Stegenga, 2018,
p. 198). Valles expounds and defends the merits of the population
health framework, a view developed in response to frustrations with
biomedicine that coalesced in the 1990s in Canada as an alternative
theoretical framework, before expanding internationally (Evans, Barer,
&amp; Marmor, 1994; Valles, 2018). The population health framework is
not nihilistic about medical care, but rather seeks to decenter
medicine and healthcare in the overall pursuit of health; most of the
problems and most promising solutions to ill health lay outside the
scope of biomedicine (safer workplaces, an end to racist housing
discrimination, neighborhoods where people can safely walk, socialize
and play, etc.) (Valles, 2018).</p>

<h3 id="TraHeaPra">5.4 Traditional healing practices</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Complementary, alternative, or integrative medicine&rdquo; is
biomedicine&rsquo;s &lsquo;big tent&rsquo; category for non-biomedical
systems of health care (See Other Internet Sources,
 <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov">NCCIH</a>).
 Philosophers have pointed out that biomedicine, specifically
evidence-based medicine, puts advocates of such non-biomedical systems
into a no-win position. One such philosophical challenge is that some
of the claims made by non-biomedical systems are claimed to be
non-measurable experiences, e.g., the experience of Qi life force in
traditional Chinese Medicine (Mark R. Tonelli &amp; Callahan, 2001).
This means that advocates have to either submit to the epistemological
framework of biomedicine (which may be incapable of assessing some of
the effects claimed to exist), or refusing to play by medicine&rsquo;s
rules and hence being dismissed as quackery by biomedicine.
Epistemically, it seems like the latter option is the better option,
but it would require advocates to &ldquo;work to develop new research
designs and new standards of evidence that reflect their approach to
medical care&rdquo; (Borgerson, 2005, p. 502).</p>

<p>
Classical Chinese Medicine (CCM) remains practiced in communities
around the world, and Lee draws out two core philosophical differences
between CCM and biomedicine. First, CCM has &ldquo;a process
ontology&mdash;it considers causal relationships between events and
processes to be foundational, rather than things&rdquo; (Lee, 2017,
p.2). Second, it is holistic&mdash;&ldquo;the universe and everything
in it, including human beings, constitute wholes which are different
from the sum of their parts, and which in turn are related and as well
as inter-related with other wholes&rdquo; (Lee, 2017, p. 14). It is
within this philosophical system that treatments such as acupuncture
and herbal/dietary remedies are used. While the gulf between
biomedicine and CCM is wide, it is not entirely dissimilar from some
Western scientific practices: CCM&rsquo;s approach to health and the
human body bear some resemblances to the ways that epidemiologists
approach populations&rsquo; health and how ecologists approach
ecosystems. Among other similarities, in both fields there is great
respect for balance and dynamic interconnected processes (Lee,
2021).</p>

<p>
Ayurvedic medicine takes a somewhat similarly holistic and
balance-oriented approach to the person and their health (Rastogi,
2014) (note also that holistic bodily balance is central to the
Hippocratic medicine described in Section 1.2). One way that manifests
in Ayurvedic practice&mdash;in contrast with biomedicine&mdash;is that
the biological characteristics of two individuals might be similar but
their recommended treatments might be quite different. For instance,
while biomedicine routinely hands out standardized advice on what
sorts of foods are best for someone of a given age and sex, Ayurvedic
medicine rejects the assumption that such standardization within a
single age-sex grouping is even a good default. Other factors play
larger roles than in biomedicine, including bodily changes over the
course of the day and one&rsquo;s (internal) body type (affecting how
one metabolizes specific foods, etc.). Complicating matters is that
Ayurvedic medicine gradually developed in South Asia&rsquo;s diverse
cultural and religious history (Desai, 1988), cohering into a set of
written texts in the 7th century CE (Maas, 2018).</p>
