<h1>Anomalous Monism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Nov 8, 2005; substantive revision Fri May 16, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Anomalous Monism is a theory about the scientific status of
psychology, the physical status of mental events, and the relation
between these issues developed by Donald Davidson. It claims that
psychology cannot be a science like basic physics, in that it cannot
in principle yield exceptionless laws for predicting or explaining
human thoughts and actions (<em>mental anomalism</em>). It also holds
that thoughts and actions must be physical (<em>monism</em>, or
token-identity), contradicting the paradigmatic dualist view of
Descartes that mental and physical states are entirely different
things. Thus, according to Anomalous Monism, psychology cannot be
reduced to physics, but must nonetheless share a physical
ontology.</p>

<p>
While neither of these claims, on its own, is novel, their relation,
according to Anomalous Monism, is. It is precisely <em>because</em>
there can be no such strict laws governing mental events that those
events <em>must</em> be identical to physical events. Most previous
identity theories of mind had held that claims concerning the identity
of particular mental and physical events (tokens) depended upon the
discovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical properties
(types). Empirical evidence for psychophysical laws was thus held to
be required for particular token-identity claims. Token-identity
claims thus depended upon type-identity (see Johnston, 1985,
408&ndash;409). Davidson&rsquo;s monism is dramatically different
&ndash; it requires no empirical evidence and <em>depends</em> on
there being no lawlike relations between mental and physical
properties. It in effect justifies the token-identity of mental and
physical events through arguing for the impossibility of
type-identities between mental and physical properties. (For detailed
discussion of how Davidson&rsquo;s position relates to David
Lewis&rsquo;s argument for type identity (Lewis 1966), see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#ComDavLewArgMon">A.2.1</a>.
 For discussion of philosophical positions related to Davidson&rsquo;s
version of monism, see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html">A</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The appeal of Anomalous Monism is owed to these striking and novel
features, a fairly straightforward argumentative structure, and its
attempt to bring together an intuitively acceptable metaphysics
(monism) with a sophisticated understanding of the relation between
psychological and physical explanatory schemes (anomalism). Its
explicit assumptions are each intended, on their own, to be acceptable
to positions opposing monism, but, when taken together, to show that
monism is in fact required. Anomalous Monism thus maintains the
autonomy of the common sense view of persons as agents acting for
reasons while nonetheless acknowledging that persons are part of the
physical world.</p>

<h2 id="ArgForAnoMon">1. The Argument for Anomalous Monism</h2>

<p>
The basic structure of the argument for Anomalous Monism is as
follows. We start with the plausible assumption that some mental
events, such as believing that it is raining, are caused by certain
physical events, in this case the rain. Similarly, it is assumed that
some physical events, such as one&rsquo;s arm rising, are caused by
certain mental events, such as deciding to scratch one&rsquo;s head.
Davidson calls this the Principle of Causal Interaction; we shall call
it the interaction principle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Interaction Principle</em>: Some mental events causally
interact with some physical events</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Davidson presents this assumption as obvious and not in need of
justification, but we shall see that motivations for it can be found
in parts of his writings
 (<a href="#MenCau">&sect;2.2</a>).
 To this interaction principle is added the requirement that all
singular causal interactions are covered by strict laws &ndash; laws
that state conditions under which an effect will occur, without any
exceptions. (for caveats and details, see
 <a href="#StrLaw">&sect;3.1</a>).
 Davidson calls this the Principle of the Nomological Character of
Causality; we shall call it the cause-law principle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Cause-Law Principle</em>: Events related as cause and effect
are covered by strict laws</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This cause-law principle was also initially assumed without argument
by Davidson, though we shall see below
 (<a href="#ObjCauLawPri">&sect;3.2</a>)
 how he later came to try to justify it. Now, the assumptions so far
seem to point directly to the existence of strict psychophysical laws
&ndash; if some particular mental event <em>m</em><sub>1</sub> is
caused by some particular physical event <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, then,
given the cause-law principle, it seems to follow that there must be a
strict law of the form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;. That is, whenever events of kind
<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> occur, events of kind <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>
must follow. However, Davidson then claims that there can be no such
laws. He calls this the Principle of the Anomalism of the Mental, and
it holds that mental predicates are not suitable for inclusion in
strict laws of any kind; we shall call it the anomalism principle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Anomalism Principle</em>: There are no strict laws on the
basis of which mental events can predict, explain, or be predicted or
explained by other events</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Davidson offered loose ruminations concerning rationality and
rationalizing explanations, which purportedly constitute the very
nature of mental predicates, in support of the anomalism principle
 (<a href="#RatArg">&sect;4</a>).
 All of this will be discussed in detail below.</p>

<p>
One point to note here is that Davidson generally prefers to talk
about mental and physical <em>predicates</em> &ndash; linguistic terms
&ndash; as opposed to <em>properties</em>, which are typically thought
to be a distinct class of metaphysical entities that invite many
questions concerning their existence and nature. But Davidson
sometimes talks in terms of properties and concepts, and allows for a
loose equivalency between these (see Davidson 1993, fn. 3) except when
talking directly about the metaphysics of causation, which he insists
is a relation between particular events (see below and
 <a href="#StrLaw">&sect;3.1</a>).
 In the discussion to follow, we shall follow Davidson&rsquo;s
allowance for this loose equivalency, and often speak of mental and
physical properties, because this is how much of the secondary
literature on Anomalous Monism proceeds. When it is important, the
distinction between predicates and properties will be noted.</p>

<p>
With the interaction principle, the cause-law principle, and the
anomalism principle now in place, we can see that there is a tension
in need of resolution. From the interaction and cause-law principles
it follows that there must be strict laws covering the interaction
between mental and physical events. But the anomalism principle
entails that there are no strict psychophysical laws. How can all
three principles be held simultaneously?</p>

<p>
To resolve the tension, Davidson noted that while the cause-law
principle requires that there be strict covering laws, it
doesn&rsquo;t specify the vocabulary in which those laws must be
formulated. If particular physical event <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> causes
particular mental event <em>m</em><sub>1</sub>, and there must be some
strict law covering this interaction, but there is no strict law of
the form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, then there must be some other law,
&lsquo;?<sub>1</sub> &rarr; ?<sub>2</sub>&rsquo;, which covers the
causal relation between <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> and
<em>m</em><sub>1</sub>. That is, <em>m</em><sub>1</sub> and
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub> must instantiate properties suitable for
inclusion in strict laws; but since we know from the anomalism
principle that <em>M</em><sub>1</sub> is not a property of this kind,
<em>m</em><sub>1</sub> must instantiate some other property.
Davidson&rsquo;s ingenious deduction at this point was that this
property must be physical, since only the physical sciences hold out
the promise of a closed system of strict laws (Davidson 1970,
223&ndash;24; on the notion of a closed system, see
 <a href="#TokIde">&sect;5.1</a>
 and supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>).
 Therefore, every causally interacting mental event must be
token-identical to some physical event &ndash; hence, monism
 (<a href="#TokIde">&sect;5.1</a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Monism</em>: Every causally interacting mental event is
token-identical to some physical event</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In arguing in this way, Davidson relies upon a key distinction between
explanation and causation. While explanation is, intuitively, an
intensional notion &ndash; one sensitive to how events are described
&ndash; causation is extensional, obtaining between pairs of events
independently of how they are described. For example, a bridge&rsquo;s
collapse is explained by the explosion of a bomb. That explosion, let
us suppose, was the most newsworthy event of the day. While the most
newsworthy event of the day <em>caused</em> the bridge&rsquo;s
collapse, citing the most newsworthy event of the day does not provide
an <em>explanation</em> of that collapse. Telling someone that it was
the most newsworthy event of the day that explained the bridge&rsquo;s
collapse wouldn&rsquo;t provide an explanation &ndash; it
wouldn&rsquo;t make the bridge&rsquo;s collapse intelligible to the
audience &ndash; though it would pick out its actual cause. How the
cause is described is relevant to whether an explanation occurs.
Causes and effects can be accurately picked out using a variety of
expressions, many of which are not explanatory. As we shall see, the
distinction between causation and explanation is crucial to Anomalous
Monism
 (<a href="#MenProExpRel">&sect;&sect;6.1&ndash;6.3</a>;
 see also related discussion of the intensionality of
<em>deterministic</em> relations in supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnomMoniKant">B.3.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Finally, to alleviate certain concerns about the adequacy of the form
of physicalism he was endorsing, Davidson endorsed a dependency
relation of supervenience of the mental on the physical, and claimed
that it was consistent with Anomalous Monism (Davidson 1970, 214;
1993; 1995a, 266; for further discussion of supervenience, see
 <a href="#TokIde">&sect;5.1</a>,
 <a href="#SupConMenAno">&sect;5.3</a> and supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#SupExpPriPhy">E.3</a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Supervenience of the Mental on the Physical</em>: if two events
share all of their physical properties, they will share all of their
mental properties</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In what follows (2&ndash;5), each step of this argument will be
analyzed and discussed separately, but always with an eye to the
overall argument. In 6, a central objection to Anomalous Monism
&ndash; that it appears unable to account for the causal/explanatory
power of mental events and properties &ndash; will be explained and
discussed. (For discussion of the relationship between Anomalous
Monism and two other pillars of Davidson&rsquo;s philosophy &ndash;
his rejection of conceptual relativism and commitment to semantic
externalism &ndash; see supplements
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnoMonSchConDua">B.1</a>
 and
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#MenAnoSemExt">B.2</a>.)</p>
 
<h2 id="PreIIntPri">2. Premise I: The Interaction Principle</h2>

<p>
The interaction principle states that some mental events causally
interact with some physical events. In this section we will look
briefly at a number of issues related to this principle: how mental
and physical events are demarcated, the nature of events themselves,
the scope of the interaction principle, the relationship between
mental events and causation, and the use of the interaction principle
in establishing one component of mental anomalism &ndash;
<em>psychological anomalism</em>, according to which there can be no
strict, purely psychological laws. Psychological anomalism is to be
distinguished from <em>psychophysical anomalism</em>, which holds that
there can be no strict psychophysical laws. This latter thesis will be
explored in detail in our discussion of the anomalism principle
 (<a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="MenPhyEve">2.1 Mental and Physical Events</h3>

<p>
Davidson restricts the class of mental events with which Anomalous
Monism is concerned to that of the propositional attitudes &ndash;
states and events picked out using psychological verbs (attitudes)
such as &lsquo;believes&rsquo;, &lsquo;desires&rsquo;,
&lsquo;intends&rsquo; and others that have propositional contents such
as &lsquo;it is raining outside&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;John believes
that it is raining outside&rsquo;). Anomalous Monism thus does not
address the status of mental events such as pains, tickles and the
like &ndash; &lsquo;conscious&rsquo; or sentient mental events. It is
concerned exclusively with sapient mental events &ndash; thoughts with
propositional content that, according to many philosophers, appear to
lack any distinctive &lsquo;feel&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
This way of distinguishing sapient and sentient events can be
questioned. We do, after all, have conscious thoughts with
propositional contents running through our heads, and consciously
thinking that it is raining outside does <em>prima facie</em> seem to
be a different sort of <em>experience</em> than consciously thinking
that one will be playing squash this evening. While it isn&rsquo;t
obvious that the one thought <em>feels</em> differently than the
other, this is nonetheless a problem for the traditional distinction
that Davidson is assuming. Further, it brings out a difficulty in
Davidson&rsquo;s picture of the mental generally. On the one hand, he
is suspicious about the idea of mental states that lack conceptual
content (Davidson 1974a), which is how philosophers have traditionally
thought of conscious mental phenomena (for further discussion of this
issue, see supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnoMonSchConDua">B.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#UncBroRatIde">&sect;4.1.3</a>).
 On the other hand, conscious mental events such as pain are commonly
thought to occur in non-rational animals, a position with which
Davidson shows some sympathy (Davidson 1985a). Davidson tends to take
a radically third-person picture of propositional attitudes, as being
what is attributed to others in explanation of their behavior, and
this leads him to not pay attention to the first-person experience of
conscious propositional thought (for related discussion of this issue,
see Moran 1994).</p>

<p>
Davidson does express some skepticism about the possibility of
formulating a clear and general definition of the class of mental
phenomena (Davidson 1970, 211). But for current purposes the class of
propositional attitudes will have to suffice as a criterion for the
mental phenomena Davidson is focused on, putting to one side the issue
of <em>conscious</em> propositional attitudes. One key reason for so
limiting the reach of Anomalous Monism, as we shall see
 (<a href="#RatArg">&sect;4.1</a>),
 is that it is the <em>rational</em> status of the relevant mental
events that Davidson usually cites as responsible for mental
anomalism. Mental events and states without propositional content
&ndash; such as pains and tickles &ndash; intuitively appear to fall
outside of the domain of considerations concerning rationality, and
thus outside of the purview of Davidson&rsquo;s argument, since they
lack the logical structure that propositional content has to figure
into justifications (for example, John wants to go to law school
because he believes that going to law school is required in order to
obtain a license to practice law, and he wants to practice law).</p>

<p>
Davidson is even less helpful about offering a criterion for the
&lsquo;physical&rsquo; (Davidson 1970, 211). One half-hearted attempt
comes in the statement that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[p]hysical theory promises to provide a comprehensive closed system
guaranteed to yield a standardized, unique description of every
physical event couched in a vocabulary amenable to law. (Davidson
1970, 224)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is at best a promissory note about some future language of
&lsquo;physics&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;true&rsquo; physics &ndash;
and it incorporates a requirement of the causal closure of the
physical domain that creates problems for certain aspects of Anomalous
Monism (see supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>).
 It is probably best to take a &lsquo;physical&rsquo; description
simply to be one that occurs in the language of a future science that
is similar to what we call &lsquo;physics&rsquo; today but with none
of its inadequacies. One important component of such descriptions is
their capacity to figure in strict laws of nature (see
 <a href="#StrLaw">&sect;3.1</a>).
 Davidson claims that this is non-negotiable for physical terms;
indeed, he tends to think of it as definitional for them (Davidson
1970, 221&ndash;22); however, see Davidson 1970, 211. For
complications that this assumption poses for both monism and mental
anomalism within Davidson&rsquo;s framework, see supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>).
 However, he sees it is an open question for mental terms, and will be
arguing
 (<a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>)
 for a negative answer.</p>

<p>
When Davidson first argued for Anomalous Monism he subscribed to a
causal criterion of event-individuation, according to which two events
are identical if they share all the same causes and effects (Davidson
1969). He much later came to reject that criterion in favor of one
according to which events are identical if and only if they occupy the
same spatiotemporal region (Davidson 1985b). The difference between
these views will not, however, be reflected in our discussion. It does
not appear to affect either the derivation or the essential nature of
Anomalous Monism. For our purposes, Davidson&rsquo;s central claims
are that what makes an event mental (or physical) is that it has a
mental (or physical) description, and the extensionalist thesis that
events are concrete entities that can be described in many different
ways (&lsquo;the flipping of the light switch&rsquo;, &lsquo;the
illuminating of the room&rsquo; and &lsquo;the alerting of the burglar
that someone is home&rsquo; can all pick out the same one event in
different terms). (For controversies concerning extensionalism, see
 <a href="#ObjTokIde">&sect;5.2</a>
 and supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnoMonSchConDua">B.1</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The interaction principle states that at least some mental events
cause and are caused by physical events (Davidson 1970, 208). This
leaves open the possibility of mental events that do not causally
interact with physical events. However, given Davidson&rsquo;s early
views about event-individuation (the causal criterion) it is unclear
that this possibility can be realized. His later views on
event-individuation appear to leave this possibility open, but his
general claims about the causal individuation of mental contents and
attitudes (see
 <a href="#CauDefArg">&sect;4.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#CauConRea">&sect;6.3</a>
 below) also stand in some tension with this possibility. In any case,
Davidson goes on to say that he in fact believes that all mental
events causally interact with physical events (Davidson 1970, 208),
but he restricts his argument only to those that actually do. Given
the pressures just noted in favor of the inclusive reading of the
interaction principle, we shall assume that it applies to all mental
events in what follows.</p>

<p>
The interaction claim itself should be understood in terms that bring
out the all-important extensional understanding of causation for
Davidson, as follows: events that have a mental description cause and
are caused by events that have a physical description. This
formulation brings out his view that events are causally related no
matter how they are described, and also leaves open the possibility,
which Davidson will subsequently argue for, that mental events in
particular must have some non-mental description. At this stage that
possibility is left as an open question, but it is important to notice
that for it to be an open question we need to at least allow for a
distinction between events and the ways in which they are picked out
in language.</p>

<h3 id="MenCau">2.2 Mental Causation</h3>

<p>
Though this will be focused on separately below
 (<a href="#EpiObj">&sect;6</a>),
 since it raised a fundamental objection to Anomalous Monism, it is
also important to recognize that we are beginning with the assumption
that mental events cause and are caused by physical events. Many
critics of Anomalous Monism have claimed that it is difficult to see
how the position avoids epiphenomenalism &ndash; the view that mental
events are causally/explanatorily impotent &ndash; and that Anomalous
Monism is therefore unacceptable as an account of the place of the
mental in the physical world. Briefly for now, that concern arises
because Anomalous Monism appears to assume the <em>casual closure of
the physical domain</em>: every physical event must have a physical
explanation. This raises the question of why or how mental events can
cause physical events, since they seem redundant in light of the
required physical causes (see supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>
 for complications concerning the status and role of causal closure in
the argument for monism). However, since Anomalous Monism is in part
<em>based upon</em> the interaction principle, Davidson can claim that
if Anomalous Monism is true, then mental events are already known to
have a kind of causal efficacy. As we shall see, this point is not by
itself sufficient to ward off all epiphenomenalist concerns about
Anomalous Monism. But it does serve to remind us of the full framework
within which challenges to Anomalous Monism must be assessed, and in
particular brings out the reliance of that framework on specific
assumptions about causality (see Sections
 <a href="#CauDefArg">&sect;4.2</a>,
 <a href="#EpiObj">&sect;6</a>, and Yalowitz 1998a).</p>

<p>
What needs to be noted at this point is that Davidson argued early on
for the claim that mental events have causal efficacy, through noting
a problem for non-causal accounts of action explanation (Davidson
1963). Mental events and states explain action by making it
intelligible &ndash; rational &ndash; in light of the agent&rsquo;s
beliefs and purposes. The challenge that Davidson raised for
non-causal theories of action explanation was to account for the fact
that, for any action performed, there may well be a large number of
mental events and states true of the agent, and capable of
rationalizing the action, but that don&rsquo;t thereby
<em>explain</em> that action. The agent acted <em>because</em> of some
specific beliefs and purposes, but other beliefs and purposes of his
could just as easily rationalize that action, and thus be cited in its
explanation. Was the agent moving his hand as he did because he wanted
to swat the fly, relieve a cramp, or wave in greeting? He may well
have wanted to achieve all three of these aims, but still only in fact
performed the action <em>because</em> of one of these reasons. How do
we understand &lsquo;because&rsquo; so as to rule out the pretenders?
Davidson&rsquo;s claim was that it is only if we understand
&lsquo;because&rsquo; as &lsquo;was caused by&rsquo; that we can
justifiably pick out the genuine <em>explanans</em> &ndash; thereby
imputing causal potency to mental events. (Given Davidson&rsquo;s key
distinction between causation and explanation, it is worth noting that
some, but not all, explanations require a causal foundation. There are
forms of explanation that do not require causal backing at all.
Logical explanations are one clear example: the relations between the
assumptions and the conclusion they justify and therefore explain in a
logical proof do not entail a causal relationship between them. Action
explanations, however, are different: rationalization, while an
explanatory notion, is only necessary but not sufficient for action
explanation. For a rationalization to provide an explanation of an
action, something more is needed according to Davidson&rsquo;s
argument. His claim is that a causal relation must hold between the
reasons and the action they justify in order for that action to be
explained by them.)</p>

<p>
What exactly does this argument show? It is intended to tell against
non-causal theories of action, which deny that reasons explain actions
by causing them. There have been sophisticated attempts, on the behalf
of non-causal theories of action explanation, to respond to this
challenge (von Wright 1971; Wilson 1985; Ginet 1995; for a good
overview, see Stoutland 1976; and see related discussion in
 <a href="#CauConRea">&sect;6.3</a>.)
 However, assuming the argument is successful, while it does establish
mental efficacy of a kind, it does not by itself establish the
interaction principle. Establishing that reasons explain actions by
causing them, and that therefore reasons causally interact with
<em>actions</em>, does not establish that reasons causally interact
with <em>physical</em> events. Dualists who reject the identity of
mental and physical events will surely object.</p>

<p>
This distinction between action and mere behavior/bodily movement is
key to many of the issues raised by Anomalous Monism. According to
Davidson, action is (identical to) intentionally described behavior
&ndash; the movement of a hand through space in a certain way may be
an action of waving or swatting or some other action. But it need not
be: it may simply be mere bodily behavior &ndash; as happens as the
result of a muscle twitch or a strong gust of wind, when something
happens <em>to</em> the agent rather than being <em>done</em>
<em>by</em> her. The behavior must be caused by and rationalized by an
agent&rsquo;s beliefs and desires in order to be an <em>action.</em>
However, while this is necessary for action, it is not, according to
Davidson, sufficient. The behavior must be caused <em>in the right
way</em> by the beliefs and desires that rationalize it. And Davidson
is skeptical about the possibility of cashing out what it means to be
<em>caused in the right way</em> (Davidson 1973b, 78&ndash;9), for
reasons relating to mental anomalism (Davidson 1973b, 80; see
supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#DevCauChaMenAno">D.1</a>
 for explicit discussion). The key point for now is that because
Davidson rejects the possibility of analyzing action in terms of
behavior caused in a particular way by reasons, the point made by the
&lsquo;because&rsquo; argument cannot be used to establish that mental
events cause <em>physical</em> events. It does not follow from the
fact that reasons must cause <em>actions</em> in order to explain them
that reasons must cause <em>behavior</em> or (the interaction
principle) that reasons <em>do</em> cause behavior. It does not entail
that actions <em>are</em> physical behavior.</p>

<p>
This point is important when one considers the wider framework to
which the interaction principle contributes. Davidson is attempting to
derive monism from it and other principles that are themselves neutral
about the metaphysics of mind. His monism (and, as we shall see in
 <a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>,
 his anomalism principle) extends to <em>all</em> intentionally
described phenomena: not just propositional attitudes, but actions as
well. He therefore cannot assume that action <em>is</em> (identical
with) behavior on pain of circularity. Once monism has been
established, Davidson will be in a position to deploy the
&lsquo;because&rsquo; point in order to argue for the claim that
mental events are causally efficacious with respect to physical
events. How this relates to the wave of epiphenomenalist criticism
about Anomalous Monism will be explored in detail below
 (<a href="#EpiObj">&sect;6</a>,
 and see supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#MenProCauRel">E.1</a>).
 To summarize, the interaction principle is an unargued assumption in
the Davidsonian framework, one that does not assume monism, and the
&lsquo;because&rsquo; argument, while important for ruling out
non-causal theories of <em>action</em>, does not itself establish the
interaction principle.</p>

<h3 id="PsyAno">2.3 Psychological Anomalism</h3>

<p>
Davidson uses the interaction principle to establish directly one part
of mental anomalism &ndash; <em>psychological anomalism</em>, which
denies the possibility of strict, <em>purely psychological</em> laws
of the form &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>2</sub>
&rarr; <em>M</em><sub>3</sub>&rsquo; (Davidson 1970, 224; 1974b, 243).
Since this argument depends only on the interaction principle, and not
on further considerations that figure into the argument for
psychophysical anomalism
 (<a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>),
 it will be explained here. The argument for psychological anomalism
is that if physical events causally impact on mental events, then the
mental domain is &lsquo;open&rsquo;, and any laws in which mental
predicates figure will have to take this into account (for related
discussion, see the supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>).
 More generally, physical conditions will always play some role in any
plausible psychological generalizations, because physical intervention
(e.g., bodily injury) is always a possibility and can prevent the
occurrence of the consequent &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>3</sub>&rsquo;.
Thus, the only <em>potentially</em> true and strict laws in which
psychological predicates can figure are variants of the psychophysical
form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub> &rarr; <em>M</em><sub>3</sub>&rsquo;.
<em>Psychophysical anomalism</em>, the other component of mental
anomalism and the one that denies the possibility of such strict laws,
is thus the view that Davidson focuses on establishing.</p>

<h2 id="PreIICauLawPri">3. Premise II: The Cause-Law Principle</h2>

<p>
The cause-law principle states that events related as cause and effect
are covered by strict laws. In the earliest formulations of Anomalous
Monism, Davidson assumed but did not argue for this principle. His
later arguments in support of it will be considered below
 (<a href="#JusCauLawPri">&sect;3.2</a>),
 along with objections to the principle
 (<a href="#ObjCauLawPri">&sect;3.3</a>).
 But we need to consider the nature of the requirement contained in
this principe, and how it relates to the framework out of which
Anomalous Monism is deduced.</p>

<h3 id="StrLaw">3.1 Strict Laws</h3>

<p>
The nature of the strict laws required by the cause-law principle is
as follows. For any causal relationship between particular events
<em>e</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>e</em><sub>2</sub>, there must be a
strict law &ndash; one without exceptions &ndash; covering those
events. Those laws must use a particular vocabulary for describing
those particular events as being of a certain type. There therefore
must be a law of the form &lsquo;(<em>C</em><sub>1</sub> &amp;
<em>D</em><sub>1</sub>) &rarr; <em>D</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;, where
&lsquo;<em>C</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; states a set of standing
conditions, and &lsquo;<em>D</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; is a description
of <em>e</em><sub>1</sub> that is sufficient, given
<em>C</em><sub>1</sub>, for the occurrence of an event of the kind
&lsquo;<em>D</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;, which is a description of
<em>e</em><sub>2</sub>. Traditionally, a strict law has been thought
of as one where the condition and event-types specified in the
antecedent of the law are such as to <em>guarantee</em> that the
condition or event-types specified in the consequent occur &ndash; the
latter <em>must</em> occur if the former in fact obtain. But
indeterministic or probabilistic versions of strict laws are possible
as well (Davidson 1970, 219). The point that distinguishes strict laws
is not so much the guaranteeing of the effect by satisfaction of the
antecedent. Instead, it is the inclusion, in the antecedent, of all
conditions and events that can be stated that could possibly
<em>prevent</em> the occurrence of the effect. A strict
<em>indeterministic</em> law would be one that specified everything
required in order for some effect to occur. If the effect does not
occur when those conditions obtain, there is nothing else that could
be cited in explanation of this failure (other than the brute fact of
an indeterministic universe). For reasons of simplicity, we will
assume determinism in this discussion, though what is said about
strict laws could be carried over without remainder to strict
indeterministic laws.</p>

<p>
The cause-law principle is aimed, in the first instance, at laws of
<em>succession</em>, which cover singular causal relationships between
events at distinct times. However, as will become clearer below,
mental anomalism also takes in <em>bridge</em> laws that would
correlate <em>simultaneous</em> instantiations of mental and physical
predicates as well &ndash; such as &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>
&rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>
&rarr; <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>
&harr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;. Indeed, mental anomalism rejects
the possibility of <em>any</em> strict law in which mental predicates
figure (where those predicates figure essentially, and are not
redundant) &ndash; including (as we have seen
 (<a href="#PsyAno">&sect;2.3</a>))
 laws formulated with purely mental predicates
(&lsquo;(<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>2</sub>) &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>3</sub>&rsquo;), as well as laws with mental predicates
in either the antecedent or consequent, such as
&lsquo;(<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>2</sub>) &rarr;
<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; and &lsquo;(<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &amp;
<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>) &rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; and mixed
variants of these (see
 <a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>
 and supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#DevCauChaMenAno">D.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The denial of strict laws of these forms is consistent with allowing
hedged versions of them which are qualified by a <em>ceteris
paribus</em> clause. &lsquo;All things being equal&rsquo; or
&lsquo;under normal conditions&rsquo;, such psychological and
psychophysical generalizations can, according to Davidson, be
justifiably asserted (Davidson 1993, 9; Campbell 2020, 34&ndash;35
misses this, claiming that Davidson&rsquo;s mental anomalism rules out
providing causal explanations for general psychological phenomena
(&ldquo;belief that one is pregnant causes cessation of
smoking&rdquo;, Campbell 2020, 33). Such generalizations &ndash;
surely only <em>ceteris paribus</em> and not strict &ndash; are
entirely consistent with Davidson&rsquo;s mental anomalism). As will
be discussed below
 (<a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>),
 denying the strict version of these generalizations amounts to
denying that the qualifying clause &lsquo;<em>ceteris
paribus</em>&rsquo; can be fully explicated. That is,
&lsquo;<em>ceteris paribus</em>, ((<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>) &rarr; <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>)&rsquo; cannot
be transformed into something like &lsquo;(<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>
&amp; <em>P</em><sub>3</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>3</sub>) &rarr;
<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; (for a related discussion of this
particular issue, see the debate between Schiffer 1991 and Fodor
1991).</p>

<p>
(Davidson organizes his discussion of this transformation process, and
Anomalous Monism more generally, around a distinction between
&lsquo;homonomic&rsquo; and &lsquo;heteronomic&rsquo; generalizations
(Davidson 1970, 219). That distinction is extremely problematic for
the purposes of establishing Anomalous Monism, and is set aside here
in favor of the related (but by no means identical) distinction
between strict and <em>ceteris paribus</em> generalizations. For
discussion of the former distinction, see supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#HomHetGen">C.2</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="JusCauLawPri">3.2 Justifying the Cause-Law Principle</h3>

<p>
Davidson argues directly for the cause-law principle &ndash; that
singular causal relations require strict covering laws &ndash; on the
basis of claimed conceptual interconnections between the concepts of
<em>physical object</em>, <em>events</em>, <em>changes</em>, and
<em>law</em> (Davidson 1995a). As he says, &ldquo;our concept of a
physical object is the concept of an object whose changes are governed
by laws&rdquo; (Davidson 1995a, 274). He also appeals to ways in which
the concept of change has itself changed over time in support of the
principle. Finally, Davidson&rsquo;s views on dispositions also
appears in his thinking concerning that principle. All three sets of
considerations face the same problem: they appear to fail to motivate
the need for <em>strict</em> laws because they are consistent with
only a requirement of <em>ceteris paribus</em> laws for causation. We
will discuss them in turn.</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s first line of argument is as follows: instances of
causation involve changes in objects from being one way to being
another: the match goes from lacking to having a flame because it is
struck on red phosphorus. According to Davidson&rsquo;s extensionalism
about causation
 (<a href="#ArgForAnoMon">&sect;1</a>),
 such changes occur independently of how we describe objects in
language. He then asks what counts as a genuine change in an object,
as opposed to merely describing the object in a way that sounds like a
change has occurred when it really hasn&rsquo;t. We can and have
invented ways of describing the world that don&rsquo;t succeed in
capturing the reality of causal goings-on &ndash; think of outdated
concepts in science such as phlogiston, or the humoral theory of
disease dating back to the ancient Greeks. So we need to know which
predicates pick out genuine changes as opposed to mere changes in name
or description only. Davidson&rsquo;s idea is that only predicates
that figure into laws pick out genuine changes. There are no genuine
laws of nature involving phlogiston or humors. Scientific
experimentation and investigation has shown this to be the case. They
therefore cannot be used to accurately describe the causal goings-on
in the world. As Davidson says, &ldquo;it is just the predicates which
are projectible, the predicates that enter into valid inductions, that
determine what counts as a change&rdquo; (Davidson 1995a, 272). Valid
inductions from the applications of genuine predicates to particular
observations (such as all observed ravens being black) lead to the
formulation of true laws of nature (such as all ravens are black).
(For more detailed discussion of this argument, see the supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauChaLaw">C.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The conclusion Davidson draws from this is that genuine changes
resulting from instances of causation are described by predicates
suitable for inclusion within valid inductions underlying genuine
laws. But how does this relate to the cause-law principle? That
principle insists that where there is causal interaction there must be
<em>strict</em> laws. But nothing in what has been argued concerning
the need for the concept of law to distinguish genuine from
non-genuine changes rules out the use of <em>ceteris paribus</em>
laws, at least not without further argument that Davidson
doesn&rsquo;t supply. So it is unclear why Davidson would think that
it is the notion of a <em>strict</em> law in particular that this line
of argument supports.</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s second argument is that the notion of a change has
itself evolved over time. For instance, Newtonian mechanics defines a
change differently than Aristotelian physics, so that continuous
motion counts as a change, and thus requires an explanation, according
to the latter but not the former. Thus, the very notion of
&lsquo;change&rsquo; is theory dependent, and therefore (Davidson
holds) presupposes the notion of &lsquo;law&rsquo;, in the sense that
something counts as a change, and thus as having a cause, only against
a background of theoretical principles.</p>

<p>
This second point does not appear to deliver the result Davidson is
after &ndash; establishing that each causal interaction must be
covered by a particular strict law. The claim that something is a
change, and thus has a cause, only if certain theoretical assumptions
are in place is consistent with the claim that those assumptions (for
instance, that uniform rectilinear motion does not count as a change)
cannot play the explanatory role for specific causal interactions that
strict laws are supposed to play. They are simply of too general a
nature &ndash; they don&rsquo;t enable predictions or explanations of
any particular events. And in any case, once again there appears to be
nothing in Davidson&rsquo;s considerations here that forces the
requirement that the covering laws be strict as opposed to <em>ceteris
paribus</em>. (As we have already seen
 (<a href="#StrLaw">&sect;3.1</a>),
 Davidson himself has insisted upon the legitimacy and ubiquity of
<em>ceteris paribus</em> laws in scientific explanation.)</p>

<p>
A third line of argument that Davidson offers (see also
 <a href="#CauDefArg">&sect;4.2</a>)
 appears to suggest that dispositional predicates &ndash; those
defined in terms of the effects they tend to bring about &ndash; are
not suitable for inclusion in strict laws (generalizations in which
they figure are always qualified by a <em>ceteris paribus</em>
clause), but there must be strict laws at the bottom, so to speak, of
the dispositional vocabulary. Davidson&rsquo;s discussion of this
issue refers back to an older debate about the status of dispositional
terms &ndash; specifically, whether they are
&lsquo;place-holders&rsquo; for predicates that are non-dispositional
(&lsquo;intrinsic&rsquo; or &lsquo;manifest&rsquo;) (see Goodman 1983,
41ff). Whatever one&rsquo;s view about that issue, it again does not
appear that Davidson has provided adequate argument for establishing
that <em>strict</em> laws (as opposed to <em>ceteris paribus</em>
laws) are required for our dispositional vocabulary to operate as it
does. So Davidson does not appear to have provided the cause-law
principle with a compelling rationale (for skepticism about the
principle, see Anscombe 1971, Cartwright 1983, McDowell 1985, Hornsby
1985 and 1993, and
 <a href="#ObjCauLawPri">&sect;3.3</a>
 below). This is not to say that it is false, or even that it is
implausible to assume it in his argument for Anomalous Monism. Many
find the principle highly intuitive, and it is worthwhile to explore
its relation to the other central claims in Davidson&rsquo;s framework
even if it lacks a convincing foundation. In fact, many of the of key
objections to the cause-law principle themselves prove to be
unconvincing or problematic. Some of these will be explored briefly in
the next section.</p>

<h3 id="ObjCauLawPri">3.3 Objections to the Cause-Law Principle</h3>

<p>
The cause-law principle has come in for a lot of criticism since it
received its canonical formulation in Hume&rsquo;s regularity theory
of causation, and it is worth briefly reviewing some of the central
objections relevant to Davidson&rsquo;s own discussions.</p>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s theory of causation holds that a particular event
<em>a</em> caused a particular event <em>b</em> only if whenever
<em>A</em>-type events occur, <em>B</em>-type events follow (Hume
1748, section 7; Hume also requires that observers of <em>A</em>-type
events <em>come to expect</em> that <em>B</em>-type events will
follow, which introduces a psychological component that will be left
aside here, since it is irrelevant to the cause-law principle). The
regularity between A-type and B-type events captures the cause-law
principle&rsquo;s requirement of strict covering laws for causal
relations between particular events. One objection to Hume&rsquo;s
theory is that it does not accurately reflect how we typically think
about causation. For example, we confidently believe that t<em>he
striking of a particular match</em> caused <em>a particular flame</em>
while knowing that in fact <em>not all matches that are struck</em>
are followed by <em>flames</em>. This point is entirely general
&ndash; we commonly identify particular cases of causation without
believing in the associated generalization between events of those
types (indeed, while knowing that such a generalization is false) (see
Anscombe 1971). So Hume&rsquo;s theory appears to be mistaken.
However, Davidson&rsquo;s extensionalism about causality provides a
straightforward response to this objection. His view is that while we
may not believe in the associated universal generalization, this is
consistent with there being <em>some</em> universal generalization,
stated in a different vocabulary than that used to initally describe
the particular events, which &lsquo;covers&rsquo; the particular case.
So the cause-law principle is consistent with Hume&rsquo;s theory once
Davidson&rsquo;s extensionalist point is recognized.</p>

<p>
While this response does appear to meet the objection, it raises the
following concern, which is behind a related objection to the
cause-law principle: no one in fact seems to know any true predictive
&lsquo;strict&rsquo; laws. Now, while it is certainly consistent with
this point that there are or even must be such laws, it becomes more
pressing to know why we should think this if we cannot even offer any
examples. It is well and good for Davidson to point to the
<em>possibility</em> of strict covering laws that transcend our
current knowledge, but we need to know why we should believe in such
things. Science seems to have done quite well for itself without any
apparent use of them. Here Davidson would reply that the cause-law
principle is required in order to make sense of the notion of a change
in a substance, which is contained in the very idea of causation, as
discussed in
 <a href="#JusCauLawPri">&sect;3.2</a>.
 That is, there is a conceptual argument for the requirement of strict
laws that doesn&rsquo;t depend on how science actually proceeds.
However, as noted in that discussion, Davidson&rsquo;s conceptual
argument is not entirely convincing.</p>

<p>
Another objection to the cause-law principle comes from the state of
contemporary physics. According to quantum mechanics, it is not simply
difficult or impossible for us to state such laws for quantum
phenomena. Rather, quantum theory appears to entail that determinism
fails to obtain at the level of microparticles. What the theory and
the behavior of such particles tells us is that causation, at least at
the level of micro phenomena, is indeterministic. And this
indeterminism is claimed to be inconsistent with the requirement of
strict laws. This objection to the cause-law principle, then, is that
philosophy should never dictate to science on empirical matters.
Observation of the world tells us that strict laws are impossible in
this domain even while causation is present, in direct contradiction
of the cause-law principle.</p>

<p>
Now, it is true that, as traditionally construed, strict laws are
supposed to guarantee the consequent condition on the basis of the
antecedent condition. But they do not <em>need</em> to provide such a
guarantee to be strict. As discussed in
 <a href="#StrLaw">&sect;3.1</a>,
 what strict laws require is that the antecedent include all
conditions and events that could possibly <em>prevent</em> the
occurrence of the consequent. If the consequent does not occur when
all these conditions have been accounted for, there is nothing else to
be cited in explanation of the non-occurrence other than the sheer
brute fact of an indeterministic universe. So indeterministic
causation is entirely consistent with the cause-law principle
(Davidson 1970, 219). The deterministic/indeterministic and
strict/non-strict law distinctions do not map neatly onto each other.
An indeterministic law can be universal, exceptionless and true. This
point does not appear to be recognized by central proponents of the
indeterministic objection to strict laws (see Cartwright 1983).</p>

<p>
A final objection to the cause-law principle which is more internal to
the wider framework of Anomalous Monism has been put forth in McDowell
1985. McDowell sees a tension between Davidson&rsquo;s commitment to
the cause-law principle and his rejection of &lsquo;the dualism of
scheme and content&rsquo; (Davidson 1974a). Briefly, the dualism
Davidson rejects is the traditional empiricist idea that human thought
and experience are the result of our conceptual and cognitive
capacities (scheme) being applied to a something entirely
non-conceptual &ndash; the world, or raw sensory data (content). That
idea is fundamental to traditional empiricists like Locke and Hume,
which is why Davidson refers to it as a dogma of empiricism. McDowell
thinks that this dogma is presupposed in the Humean claim that
singular causal relations require strict covering laws that Davidson
accepts. McDowell&rsquo;s interesting idea appears to be that Hume
requires laws in order to distinguish between cases of mere temporal
succession between two events (event <em>b</em> coming <em>after</em>
event <em>a</em>) and genuine casual relations (event <em>b</em>
coming about <em>as a result of</em> event <em>a</em>). According to
Hume, nothing in our experience of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on their
own can tell us that <em>a</em> <em>caused</em> <em>b</em>. All we
experience is event <em>a</em> occuring, and then event <em>b</em>
occuring. It is only if there is a regularity between <em>A</em>-type
and <em>B</em>-type events that we can say that this event <em>a</em>
caused this event <em>b</em>. Without that regularity, all we can say
is that event <em>a</em> merely temporally preceded event <em>b</em>,
but that isn&rsquo;t sufficient for causation. McDowell seems to think
of Hume&rsquo;s picture as committed to singular event relations like
mere temporal succession being akin to raw sensory data, and strict
laws playing the role of the human conceptualization that is required
in order to think of two <em>temporally</em> related events <em>as
causally</em> related. McDowell thus thinks that the cause-law
principle is inextricably tied to the empiricist dogma that Davidson
has rejected. McDowell also doesn&rsquo;t think that the principle is
required, as Davidson thinks, in order to establish monism (for
discussion of McDowell&rsquo;s views on materialism, see the
supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#BarMat">A.3</a>,)
 And without the need of it to justify materialism, McDowell sees the
principle as lacking any independent motivation in Davidson&rsquo;s
framework. For discussion of this issue and others related to
scheme-content dualism and Anomalous Monism, see supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnoMonSchConDua">B.1</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="PreIIIAnoPri">4. Premise III: The Anomalism Principle</h2>

<p>
The anomalism principle states that there are no strict laws on the
basis of which mental events can predict, explain, or be predicted or
explained by other events. In this section we look at different
interpretations of the argument for this principle. Davidson&rsquo;s
own formulations, while suggestive, are notoriously vague and often
appeal to very different sorts of considerations, including aspects of
language and interpretation, questions about psychological
explanation, and the nature of causality and dispositions. We shall be
looking at specific interpretations of the argument for the principle
offered by commentators, as well as the problems they face in
providing a compelling rationale for both the anomalism principle and
Anomalous Monism.</p>

<p>
While differing in important ways, the various formulations of the
argument for mental anomalism, as well as the objections to them,
exhibit a discernible pattern: Davidson, as well as his commentators,
highlight some feature of mental properties that is claimed to (1)
sharply individuate them from physical properties and (2) create a
conceptual tension with physical properties that precludes the
possibility of strict lawful relations between these properties.
According to the objections, however, the highlighted feature of
mental properties either does not serve to distinguish them from
physical properties or does not actually evidence any conceptual
tension with physical properties that rules out lawlike relations. We
will consider each interpretation, and its problems, in turn. In a
later section
 (<a href="#SupConMenAno">&sect;5.3</a>)
 we will look at another objection related to the anomalism principle
&ndash; that it is inconsistent with Davidson&rsquo;s invocation of
the doctrine that mental properties stand in a relation of
supervenience to physical properties. For discussion of the relation
between the anomalism principle and Davidson&rsquo;s views about
scheme-content dualism and semantic externalism, see supplements
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnoMonSchConDua">B.1</a>
 and
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#MenAnoSemExt">B.2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Mental anomalism, as initially formulated by Davidson, holds that
there can be no strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be
predicted and explained (Davidson 1970, 208). It thus seemed
restricted to ruling out strict laws of <em>succession</em> with
mental predicates occurring in the consequent &ndash; laws such as
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;(<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp; <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>) &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;. This denies that the occurrence of
particular mental events such as coming to believe or intend
something, or intentionally acting in some way, can be explained by
appeal to strict covering laws. But as becomes clear, Davidson&rsquo;s
considered position rejects the possibility of <em>any</em> strict
laws in which mental predicates figure &ndash; and this includes, in
particular, <em>simultaneous</em>-instantiation bridge laws of the
form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &harr;
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, which form the basis of type-identity
theories of mind, as well as any strict laws with mental antecedents.
(See supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#DevCauChaMenAno">D.1</a>
 for discussion of how mental anomalism also rules out analytic
solutions to the question of how mental states must cause behavior
<em>in the right way</em> in order to count as action.) We have
already seen how strict purely psychological laws are ruled out by the
interaction principle
 (<a href="#PsyAno">&sect;2.3</a>).
 The focus now is therefore on how Davidson rules out strict
psychophysical laws.</p>

<p>
It is useful to view Davidson&rsquo;s attacks against psychophysical
laws in light of an argument, in vogue in the 1950s and 1960s, against
the claim that reasons are causes of the actions they explain. This
argument was referred to as the &ldquo;Logical Connection
Argument&rdquo; (see Stoutland 1970). According to this argument,
reasons cannot be held to explain actions by causing them because (1)
causes and effects must be logically distinct from each other (one of
Hume&rsquo;s requirements on causality) but (2) reasons and the
actions they explain bear a quasi-logical connection to each other, by
virtue of the rationalizing relation between them. That relationship
is quasi-logical because not just any reason can explain any action
&ndash; only those reasons which actually rationalize (make
intelligible) an action can explain it. Davidson&rsquo;s own
influential response to this argument was to distinguish between
causal relations, which obtain between events no matter how they are
described (the extensionalist thesis; see
 <a href="#MenPhyEve">&sect;2.1</a>),
 and logical relations, which obtain between particular descriptions
of events. The Logical Connection Argument fails to recognize this
simple distinction between causal relations themselves and how they
are described, and so fails to rule out the idea that reasons are
causes of the actions they explain. This distinction enabled Davidson
to merge two key ideas in his theory of action &ndash; that reasons
explain by causing, and that they explain by rationalizing (Davidson
1963, 13&ndash;17). As we shall see below, however, Davidson accepts
the very basic point at the heart of the Logical Connection Argument,
and it deeply informs his thinking about mental anomalism &ndash; that
the rationalizing relationship bears a certain key property
(quasi-logical status) that is at odds with the relationship between
physically described, causally related events. (Campbell 2020,
34&ndash;35, in arguing that Davidson&rsquo;s response to the Logical
Connection Argument is inadequate, fails to register Davidson&rsquo;s
extensionalism about causation. For related discussion of Campbell,
see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Because of space limitations, the next several sections will provide
overviews of the different sorts of arguments that either Davidson or
commentators have presented in support of mental anomalism. Each

much more detailed discussion of that section&rsquo;s content for

</div>

<h3 id="RatArg">4.1 The Rationality Arguments</h3>

<p>
Central to Davidson&rsquo;s thinking about the basis for mental
anomalism is the idea that rationality is constitutive of mental
ascription. And key to that idea is the principle of charity, its role
in mental ascription, and a related doctrine of the indeterminacy of
translation (Davidson 1970, 223; see
 <a href="#HolIndArg">&sect;4.1.1</a>
 below). Rationality is claimed by Davidson to be
<em>constitutive</em> of the mental in the sense that something only
counts as being a mind &ndash; and thus an appropriate object of
psychological attributions &ndash; if it meets certain rational
standards. There are weaker and stronger versions of this idea
(Cherniak 1981; see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatMenAno">D.2</a>),
 but Davidson&rsquo;s guiding thought is that a condition of being
able to understand others is that how one <em>does</em> act and think
must <em>predominately reflect</em> how one <em>should</em> act and
think (see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>).
 The key points of contention for our purposes concern how the basic
idea of constitutiveness is put to work in understanding the basis for
mental anomalism, which will be explored in the next several
sections.</p>

<p>
The principle of charity states that, in interpreting another, we
&ldquo;try for a theory that finds him consistent, a believer of
truths, and a lover of the good (all by our own lights, it goes
without saying)&rdquo; (Davidson 1970, 222). We must, Davidson claims,
stand ready to adjust previous such assignments based upon new
evidence about the person and how it relates to the overall project of
finding him and his behavior intelligible. There are two key points
here that for Davidson point towards psychophysical anomalism. First,
we never have all possible evidence &ndash; we must maintain an
openness to better interpretations of previous behavior as new
evidence becomes available. Interpretation is always ongoing. And
second, &lsquo;better&rsquo; interpretations are those made in light
of the constitutive ideal of rationality. Consequently, Davidson
claims,</p>

<p>
there cannot be tight connections between the realms [of the mental
and the physical] if each is to retain allegiance to its proper source
of evidence. (Davidson 1970, 222)</p>

<p>
Davidson never offers any account of what the proper source of
evidence for the physical realm is and how it conflicts with mental
ascription and its guiding principle of rationality. But the
traditional distinction between normative and descriptive concepts is
a useful start, and figures in different ways in the interpretations
of mental anomalism explored below. When we look to uncover
generalizations in the physically described world, what we find to
follow from a certain set of physical conditions, at the most
fundamental level, is a <em>brute fact.</em> It seems possible that
these relations and facts could be different &ndash; the physical laws
of nature could be different. This is contrasted with mental
ascription, where the normative notion of rationality requires some
mental states to follow from others, and rules out the possibility of
certain other mental sequences, in <em>all</em> possible worlds.
Mental states bear conceptual, necessary relations to each other that
differentiate them in principle from physical states &ndash; this is
the point that Davidson accepts from the Logical Connection Argument
 (<a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>).
 This line of thinking is suggestive, but it is in need of
considerable tightening. We will discuss different aspects of such
considerations concerning rationality offered by Davidson and key
commentators in the following four subsections. For a more in-depth
discussion of issues raised in this section, see supplements
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatMenAno">D.2</a>
 and
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="HolIndArg">4.1.1 The Holism and Indeterminacy Arguments</h4>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s picture of mental ascription as responsive to an
ideal of rationality is closely tied to his discussions of holistic
and indeterminate aspects to the interpretation of action and speech.
Holism holds that mental states can explain behavior only in the
context of other mental states, which themselves depend on others
&ldquo;without limit&rdquo; (Davidson 1970, 217). Davidson links
holism to the impossibility of any definitional reduction of mental
states to behavior of the kind assumed by behaviorism, and states that
this impossibility provides a &ldquo;hint&rdquo; as to why mental
anomalism is true. Failure of behavioristic reduction would rule out
at least one kind of psychophysical law &ndash; one relating mental
states to non-intentionally described behavior. However, this would
leave unexplained what the basis is for rejecting behavioristic
reduction itself: why think the holistic appeal to other mental states
to explain behavior is &ldquo;without end&rdquo;, and that the
required mental caveats can&rsquo;t be fully cashed out in the form of
a strict law? It is at best a strong intuition that this is impossible
(a &ldquo;hint&rdquo;); we need to know why, and holism itself
doesn&rsquo;t provide that (this is acknowledged by Davidson 1995b,
12, noting that all systems of measurement are holistic).</p>

<p>
Davidson sometimes seemed to think that the thesis of the
indeterminacy of translation (Quine 1960) and interpretation (Davidson
1970, 222; 1979) might provide the connection between holism and
mental anomalism. The indeterminacy thesis holds that even assuming
the principle of charity, which rules out the possibility of
predominant irrationality and non-rationality (see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>),
 there are still empirically adequate but non-equivalent complete
frameworks for assigning linguistic meanings and mental states to a
person on the basis of his behavior, and that there is <em>no fact of
the matter</em> that determines that one but not other such frameworks
is correct. This thesis might be thought to entail mental anomalism:
if all the physical facts are consistent with different
psychological/semantic ascriptions to a person, then no one assignment
could be exceptionlessly predicted or explained &ndash; just as mental
anomalism maintains.</p>

<p>
There are two problems with this argument. First, the existence of
multiple acceptable interpretation schemes can be accommodated by
multiple psychophysical laws &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>2 </sub>&rarr;
<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>3</sub> &rarr;
<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; etc., each capturing one scheme. More
importantly, Davidson himself argues that the least controversial
examples of indeterminacy, involving divergent schemes of reference,
amounts to mere notational invariance &ndash; as he puts it, meaning
is what is <em>invariant</em> between empirically adequate translation
schemes (Davidson 1977, 225; 1999a, 81). It therefore does not appear
that indeterminacy in and of itself is capable of supporting an
across-the-board rejection of strict psychophysical laws. And Davidson
ultimately acknowledges this, in stating that mental anomalism would
hold even if indeterminacy didn&rsquo;t (Davidson 1970, 222).</p>

<p>

anomalism, see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#HolIndTraMenAno">D.3</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="NorDesPri">4.1.2 Normative and Descriptive Principles</h4>

<p>
Jaegwon Kim (Kim 1985) develops the distinction between normative and
descriptive concepts and principles by arguing that if psychophysical
laws of the form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &harr;
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>2</sub> &harr;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo; are assumed as possible, they would lead
to undermining Davidson&rsquo;s key idea that rationality is
constitutive of mental ascription. Kim understands that idea to entail
that there are necessary, strict normative psychological laws of the
form &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo; (more explicitly:
&lsquo;(<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &amp; <em>M</em><sub>3</sub>) &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;). For example, if a person believes p
and believes that p entails q, then that person both should believe
that q, and also wouldn&rsquo;t be attributed the first two beliefs
without attributing the third. Psychophysical laws would, according to
Kim, license substitutions that would lead to a contingent, strict
descriptive physical law of the form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>
&rarr; <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo; entailing and so explaining the
psychological law &lsquo;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;. But since our conception of physical
laws is that they are only contingently true, this would result in the
strict normative psychological law being only contingently true
because of the contingent nature of what explains it. And this would
undermine Davidson&rsquo;s idea that rationality is constitutive of
mental ascription, which depends on such strict normative
psychological laws being necessarily true. In order to preserve
Davidson&rsquo;s ideas about rationality, then, strict psychophysical
laws must be rejected.</p>

<p>
Kim&rsquo;s argument depends upon two assumptions that appear to be
inconsistent with the wider framework within which Davidson develops
mental anomalism (for other problems see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#KimRedStrForEstMenAno">D.4</a>).
 First, Kim assumes that the psychological laws that govern mental
ascription are strict laws. But this directly conflicts with
Davidson&rsquo;s view
 (<a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>)
 that the only laws in which mental predicates can figure are
<em>ceteris paribus</em> and not strict laws. That <em>defines</em>
mental anomalism. Kim would respond that mental anomalism applies only
to descriptive, predictive psychological and psychophysical laws
&ndash; not to the normative psychological laws that drive Kim&rsquo;s
argument (Kim 1985, 381, 383). But this raises the second problem:
Kim&rsquo;s normative law isn&rsquo;t fully normative &ndash; it has
descriptive entailments. As Kim himself says, one wouldn&rsquo;t
attribute a belief that <i>p</i> and a belief that <i>p</i> entails
<i>q</i> to a person unless one also attributed the belief that
<i>q</i>. While Kim is rightly reflecting a key part of
Davidson&rsquo;s view here that rationality is constitutive of mental
ascription &ndash; that how we <em>do</em> think and act predominately
is how we <em>should</em> think and act &ndash; this spoils the sharp
distinction between normative and descriptive laws that Kim&rsquo;s
argument depends on. The psychological law driving Kim&rsquo;s
argument is both descriptive and predictive, and therefore, as Kim
himself says, ruled out by mental anomalism.</p>

<p>
For a more in-depth discussion of Kim&rsquo;s argument, which also
explores the possibility of using <em>ceteris paribus</em>
psychological laws within his reductio strategy, see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#KimRedStrForEstMenAno">D.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
As noted briefly above, principles of rationality are not strict on
Davidson&rsquo;s view. This point comes out particularly clearly in
Davidson&rsquo;s views concerning rational principles governing
practical, and not merely, deductive, reasoning (Davidson 1985c).
These views inform a very different reading of Davidson&rsquo;s
argument for psychophysical anomalism developed by John McDowell, to
which we now turn.</p>

<h4 id="UncBroRatIde">4.1.3 Uncodifiability and Broad Rationality as An Ideal</h4>

<p>
John McDowell, like Kim, also emphasizes the normative notion of
rationality and the difference between the merely brute, contingent
relations among physical states and the necessary, conceptual
relations between mental states (McDowell 1985, 389). But he appeals
to a broader conception of rationality in Davidson&rsquo;s framework
in order to argue that there can&rsquo;t be strict psychological laws
of any kind. This broader conception goes beyond Kim&rsquo;s focus on
merely deductive relations between mental states, to take in
principles of practical and theoretical reasoning, such as the
principle of continence, which requires one to act on the basis of all
available considerations, and the principle of total evidence, which
requires one to believe the hypothesis supported by all of one&rsquo;s
evidence (see Davidson 1985c). According to McDowell, those inclined
to think that deductive relations can be captured in physical terms
(see Loar 1981) will find mental anomalism much more difficult to deny
when taking into account this broader conception of rationality.</p>

<p>
McDowell&rsquo;s key idea is that our grasp of rationality can be
mistaken about what ideal rationality actually requires in these more
complex areas, evidenced by sometimes struggling to understand others
(McDowell 1985, 392). And if our grasp of rationality at any
particular time falls short of capturing what rationality actually
requires, then we cannot formulate true strict laws stating what we
ought to think or do. This is what McDowell means by saying that
rationality is an <em>ideal</em>, and it entails that rationality is
<em>uncodifiable</em>. McDowell claims that uncodifiability in this
specific sense &ndash; concerning what we <em>ought</em> to think or
do &ndash; is what underlies mental anomalism. Like Kim, McDowell
emphasizes rationality as a normative ideal in contrast to merely
contingent descriptive physical laws. Unlike Kim, it is partly because
no detailed and fully explicated statement of a rational principle
<em>could</em> be claimed to be true that there can be no
psychophysical laws.</p>

<p>
While McDowell&rsquo;s argument appears to be influenced by
Davidson&rsquo;s remarks concerning the open-ended nature of
interpretation (Davidson 1970, 223; see
 <a href="#RatArg">&sect;4.1</a>),
 Davidson himself makes no mention of shifting standards of
rationality. Davidson&rsquo;s picture is that revised interpretations
result from a <em>stable</em> and statable set of rational standards
taking into account new evidence. McDowell&rsquo;s argument thus goes
well beyond Davidson&rsquo;s own views about rationality, even
insisting (due to the gap between ideal rationality and our conception
of it) that some rational norms may be empirically discoverable and
not <em>a priori</em> (McDowell 1985, 394). This idea appears to be
inconsistent with Davidson&rsquo;s guiding idea that rationality is
constitutive, which entails that constitutive rational norms are those
that must be attributed to someone as <em>a priori</em> commitments if
she is to be ascribed any mental content at all (Davidson 1985c; see
supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>).
 Davidson defends an <em>internalist</em> view of rational norms
&ndash; they must be reflected in the agent&rsquo;s actual psychology,
in the beliefs, values, and desires that <em>actually</em> motivate
the agent to do and think as he does. This idea is central to
Davidson&rsquo;s key claim that rationality is constitutive of mental
ascription: what we <em>ought</em> to do and, in particular, think, is
predominately what we <em>in fact</em> do and think. McDowell, on the
other hand, is articulating an <em>externalist</em> view of rational
norms (McDowell 1995), which sees them as binding on the agent &ndash;
as what he ought to do and think &ndash; despite not necessarily being
reflected in the agent&rsquo;s actual psychology. This explains the
gap McDowell insists on, but it clearly derives from a very different
picture of rationality than Davidson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
Finally, it is very unclear how McDowell moves from the idea that
rational principles are uncodifiable to the rejection of strict
descriptive psychophysical laws (McDowell 1985, 389). Uncodifiability,
as McDowell understands it, is a claim about what we <em>ought</em> to
do or think. Strict psychophysical laws would state how we
<em>will</em> think or act if certain mental and physical conditions
obtain. How we in fact <em>do</em> act and think isn&rsquo;t strictly
decided by how we <em>ought</em> to, whether or not this is
uncodifiable &ndash; we are sometimes irrational and also cognitively
limited (see supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>).
 Uncodifiability in McDowell&rsquo;s sense thus appears to make no
direct contact with the question concerning strict descriptive
psychophysical laws.</p>

<p>
McDowell is right to emphasize the broader conception of rationality
in Davidson&rsquo;s framework, but ultimately his highly idealized
view of it does not appear to provide a secure foundation for mental
anomalism given that framework. And McDowell&rsquo;s emphasis on
rationality as a normative ideal leaves him open to some of the same
problems that Kim&rsquo;s account faced
 (<a href="#NorDesPri">&sect;4.1.2</a>).
 For a more in-depth discussion of McDowell&rsquo;s argument, see
supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#UncMenAno">D.5</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="ConArg">4.1.4 The Context/Complexity Argument</h4>

<p>
William Child (1993; see also McDowell 1979) argues that mere
reflection on the sorts of psychological generalizations that we rely
on to understand each other supports mental anomalism. We think of
such generalizations as rules of thumb that hold only for the most
part, and depend upon detailed contextual supplementation surrounding
a particular case in order to yield understanding and explanation. He
suggests that the contextual supplementation required is both
enormously complex and also not appropriate for inclusion within
strict lawful statements. Unlike McDowell&rsquo;s claims about
limitations on our grasp of rationality discussed above
 (<a href="#UncBroRatIde">&sect;4.1.3</a>),
 these considerations, according to Child, explicitly suggest that
principles of rationality, in particular those governing practical
reasoning not considered by Kim
 (<a href="#NorDesPri">&sect;4.1.2</a>),
 are <em>ceteris paribus</em> and not strict.</p>

<p>
There are two problems with this argument. First, appeal to complexity
does not appear to distinguish such generalizations from physical
laws. Reflection on supplemental factors required in order to
guarantee that when a match is struck it will produce a flame points
towards an enormously complex but nonetheless strict law. There does
not appear to be a significantly robust asymmetry between
psychological and physical generalizations concerning such required
complexity to underwrite mental anomalism but allow for strict
physical laws. Second, and related, Child does not provide an
<em>explanation</em> for why such factors can be included within a
strict physical law but cannot be included within a strict
psychological law. It appears to be proposed as merely a brute fact.
For a more in-depth discussion of Child&rsquo;s argument, see
supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#ConComMenAno">D.6</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="CauDefArg">4.2 The Causal Definition Argument</h3>

<p>
Although Davidson&rsquo;s discussions of mental anomalism are
primarily connected to issues with rationality, he does offer a line
of argument connecting the causal nature of mental states and
psychological explanations with mental anomalism. Davidson has
emphasized that reasons explain actions by causing them (1963; see
 <a href="#MenCau">&sect;2.2</a>).
 He also emphasizes that both the contents of mental states (Davidson
1987a, 44) and their psychological verbs (belief vs. desire etc.
&ndash; Davidson 1987b, 41)) are causally defined. He then argues that
causal explanations and causally defined concepts are anomic (Davidson
1987b, 42; see also Davidson 1991, 162 and Davidson 1995b, 4&ndash;5).
They are anomic because causally defined concepts and causal
explanations work by selecting, from the totality of factors that
together produce some effect, the one or ones that answer to
particular explanatory interests. In the case of mental explanation,
that interest is rationalization. Explanation in physics, however, is
not interest-relative in this way because it treats all the different
factors that together produce the effect as &ldquo;the&rdquo; cause
(Davidson 1987b, 45).</p>

<p>
Davidson repeats these sorts of claims about the anomic nature of
causally defined concepts and causal explanations throughout his later
writings, but never provides an argument in support of them. And he
never brings them into direct contact with his views about rationality
as the basis for mental anomalism. It&rsquo;s possible that Davidson
is confusing two different issues: if mental concepts are causally
defined, then perhaps they&rsquo;re anomic; but this leaves open
whether we need them to explain behavior, or instead should eliminate
them in favor of nomic physical concepts. Rationality may be an answer
to this second question: if we want to understand why the agent did or
thought what she did, as opposed to have a full sufficient explanation
of why her body moved as it did, we need a selective explanation, and
rationality is the interest served by such selection (Davidson 1991,
63; see Yalowitz 1998a). Rationality, on this line of thinking, does
not account for mental anomalism; but it does speak to the question of
mental realism (see further
 <a href="#ExpExcIntRelDuaExpStr">&sect;6.2</a>).

<h2 id="Mon">5. Monism</h2>

<p>
So far we have looked at Davidson&rsquo;s three premises in support of
Anomalous Monism &ndash; the interaction, cause-law and anomalism
principles. In this section, we examine the conclusion that Davidson
draws on the basis of these principles &ndash; the token-identity
theory of mental events, according to which every causally interacting
mental event is token-identical to some physical event. We will look
at the derivation and nature of this theory, some questions about its
adequacy, as well as the additional thesis that mental properties
supervene on physical properties. As we shall see, both the
token-identity and supervenience claims turn out to be controversial,
in their motivation as well as in their consistency with mental
anomalism. One key point to keep in mind at this point is that monism
is supposed to be derived from the principles and other assumptions
that, taken individually, should be acceptable to positions opposing
monism.</p>

<p>
To begin with, it is worth pointing out that Davidson is concerned
only with the ontological status of events, and not substances. Events
are changes in substances &ndash; things &ndash; from being one way
(e.g. the candle is white) to being another way (e.g. the candle is
yellow). That is, events are changes in the properties of things.
Davidson, therefore, is interested in the status of mental and
physical properties, such as believing x, desiring y, or being yellow,
and not in the things that <em>have</em> these properties. Descartes,
however, argued for the claim that mind and body are distinct
<em>things</em>. While Descartes&rsquo;s position has implications for
accounts of mental events, the issues concerning event identity and
substance identity are distinct (see Latham 2001). Davidson clearly
takes himself to be establishing something that is inconsistent with
Cartesian dualism about mental and physical things, however, and it is
useful briefly to look at how Anomalous Monism bears upon substance
dualism.</p>

<p>
According to Descartes, mind and body are distinct substances in part
because they do not share essential properties in common. In
particular, minds cannot occupy a spatial location, while bodies
necessarily do. Since mental events thus constitute changes occurring
in a nonspatially-located entity, they also do not occupy a spatial
region. Bodily events, on the other hand, do occupy spatial locations
by virtue of being changes in material substances, which themselves
are spatially located. On Descartes&rsquo;s view, then, particular
mental and physical events cannot be token-identical, since they fail
to share a crucial property in common without which identity is
unintelligible. While Anomalous Monism is not officially concerned
with the ontological status of substances, it thus appears to have
consequences that are inconsistent with Descartes&rsquo;s substance
dualism &ndash; though it doesn&rsquo;t by itself establish substance
monism, it does rule out the Cartesian thought that mental and
physical events fail to be identical, and so conflicts with one of the
bases for Cartesian substance dualism.</p>

<h3 id="TokIde">5.1 Token Identity</h3>

<p>
The structure of Davidson&rsquo;s derivation of the token-identity of
causally interacting mental events with physical events appears to be
straightforward: causally interacting mental events (the interaction
principle) must instantiate some strict law property (the cause-law
principle) but mental properties are not suitable for inclusion in
strict laws (the anomalism principle). So mental events must
instantiate some other property, which is suitable for such inclusion.
Given Davidson&rsquo;s invocation of the causal closure of the
physical domain, according to which every physical event has a
physical explanation, he moves rather quickly to the conclusion that
this other property must be physical, since closure entails that
physical properties have a privileged status, which suggests that they
hold out the promise of strict laws. (Davidson also has a tendency
simply to identify as &lsquo;physical&rsquo; those properties that
figure in strict laws (Davidson 1970, 224; 1995a, 266), but this would
of course simply beg the question of mental anomalism by
definitionally ruling out mental properties from inclusion in strict
laws.) Consequently, causally interacting mental events must be
token-identical with physical events, ruling out Cartesian as well as
other forms of dualism.</p>

<p>
There are serious problems with the assumption of causal closure of
the physical in Davidson&rsquo;s framework (for detailed discussion,
see supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>).
 It is difficult, however, to see how Davidson can move from the claim
that mental events must instantiate non-mental, strict law properties
to the claim that these properties must be physical without assuming
closure. Why assume that only &lsquo;physical&rsquo; properties are
nomic? This raises interesting issues about the nomic status of other
special sciences &ndash; the relevant ones here being biology and
chemistry &ndash; but there do not appear to be explicit, conclusive
resources in Davidson&rsquo;s own thinking for addressing this.
Yalowitz 1998a has, however, provided an interpretation of Anomalous
Monism stressing Davidson&rsquo;s views on causality and the nomic
status of dispositions (see
 <a href="#CauDefArg">&sect;4.2</a>)
 in which causal closure is <em>derived</em> <em>from</em> the
cause-law principle, token-identity and the anomalism of causally
defined properties. On this interpretation, the strict law properties
that mental events must instantiate turn out to be physical because
only physical properties are non-causally individuated &ndash; all
special science properties are causally individuated, and all such
properties are anomic.</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s token-identity theory is dramatically different than
most previous identity theories of mind, in both its <em>a priori</em>
status as well as its stance towards the role of laws in justifying
monism. His theory is claimed to be known <em>a priori</em> to be true
because it is based upon three premises &ndash; the interaction,
cause-law, and anomalism principles &ndash; each of which is claimed
to be known <em>a priori</em> to be true. Most previous theories had
argued that claims concerning the identity of particular mental and
physical events depended upon the discovery of particular lawlike
relations between mental and physical properties. These theories thus
held that empirical evidence supporting such laws was required for
particular identity claims (see discussion of Lewis's version of such
a theory in supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#ComDavLewArgMon">A.2.1</a>).
 According to Anomalous Monism, however, it is precisely
<em>because</em> there can be no such strict laws (the anomalism
principle) that causally interacting mental events <em>must</em> be
identical to some physical event. The token-identity thesis thus
requires no empirical evidence and <em>depends</em> on there being no
such lawlike relations. It in effect justifies the token-identity of
mental and physical events through arguing for the impossibility of
type-identities between mental and physical properties (Davidson 1970,
209, 212&ndash;13; see Johnston 1985).</p>

<p>
An important point to recognize in Davidson&rsquo;s version of
token-identity is that he is not simply deriving the conclusion that
mental events bear some property that we would intuitively acknowledge
as &lsquo;physical&rsquo; (such as spatial location). As pointed out
in
 <a href="#MenPhyEve">&sect;2.1</a>,
 the relevant &lsquo;physical&rsquo; properties would more likely have
to resemble the sorts of properties currently invoked in physics, our
most mature science and the one closest to issuing in strict laws.
This point has generated numerous objections to Davidson&rsquo;s
token-identity theory, but it also has been overlooked by some
objectors (see below). Davidson&rsquo;s central claim is that what
makes a mental event identical to a physical event is that the mental
event has a physical description. In Davidson&rsquo;s original
formulation, monism entailed that every mental event can be
<em>uniquely</em> singled out using only physical concepts (1970,
215). It is this position that became the target of some
Davidson&rsquo;s critics
 (<a href="#ObjTokIde">&sect;5.2</a>).
 However, Davidson eventually came to explicitly deny that his monism
commits him to the possibility of providing descriptions of mental
events or actions in physical terms suitable for strict laws (Davidson
1999d, 639; 1999b, 653&ndash;4). He noted that strict laws will say
something to the effect that &ldquo;whenever there is a certain
distribution of forces and matter in a field of a certain size at time
<em>t</em>, it will be followed by a certain distribution of forces
and matter in a field of a certain size at time <em>t</em>&prime;
&rdquo; (Davidson 1999d, 639). And he claimed that both the
antecedents and consequents of such laws, when covering particular
mental events and actions, will cover much larger regions of space
than merely the agent or her action. Why? Because while singular
causal statements are <em>singular</em>, and therefore select from a
complete set of causal factors those that are salient or in line with
our particular explanatory interests, strict laws don&rsquo;t
themselves select &ndash; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what makes them
strict&rdquo; (Davidson 1999d, 640; see Yalowitz 1998a for an extended
discussion of this issue and its bearing on the argument for both
mental anomalism as well as monism). Davidson soft-pedals how this
view bears on the uniqueness claim in the official statement of
Anomalous Monism, parsing away that claim in favor of the blander idea
that &ldquo;some physical description applies to each mental
event&rdquo; (Davidson 1999b, 654). As subtle as it seems, this
appears to be a fundamental shift in Davidson&rsquo;s thinking about
monism, though it goes unexplored in his later work and has failed to
attract the attention of his critics. Perhaps it could be understood
in such a way as to still rule out Cartesian dualism, but it is
potentially so weak as to deem as &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; the claim
that a thought that 2 + 2 = 4 occurs in the Milky Way &ndash; which is
&ldquo;some&rdquo; physical description that applies to a mental event
(for related discussion see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#TokIdeMinMat">A.3.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In any case, Anomalous Monism thus does not inherit the problem of how
to justify specific identifications between mental and physical
events, because the claim that there is a physical description for
each mental event is established purely <em>a priori</em> (for
comparison with Lewis&rsquo;s view, see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#ComDavLewArgMon">A.2.1</a>).
 And the physical descriptions are not (indeed, cannot be) specifiable
in precise and uniquely identifying spatial and temporal terms. As we
are about to see
 (<a href="#ObjTokIde">&sect;5.2</a>),
 each of these points is overlooked by many of Davidson&rsquo;s
critics. That the latter is overlooked is understandable, given its
late appearance. However, the former point has always been
fundamental, and critics&rsquo; failure to appreciate it is
curious.</p>

<p>
Davidson additionally claims that the relation between the mental and
physical properties is not merely haphazard or coincidental. A
relationship of supervenience obtains between the two (Davidson 1970,
214; 1973a, 253; 1993; 1995a, 266; for further discussion, see
 <a href="#SupConMenAno">&sect;5.3</a>.
 Davidson never argues for supervenience. For discussion, see
supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#SupExpPriPhy">E.3</a>.)
 A working statement of this relationship is that if two events fail
to share a mental property, they will fail to share at least one
physical property (Davidson 1995a, 266) &ndash; or, equivalently, that
if two events share all of their physical properties, they will share
all of their mental properties. It is meant to articulate a kind of
dependency of the mental on the physical, and correlatively a kind of
explanatory primacy to the physical, but without claiming any kind of
reductive relation between the mental and the physical. The working
statement&rsquo;s truth depends, it seems, on the thought that the
distribution of physical properties somehow <em>explains</em> the
distribution of mental properties &ndash; failure to share a mental
property <em>depends upon/is explained by</em> failure to share at
least one physical property. The supervenience relation is usually
understood to issue in generalizations of the following kind:
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>2</sub> &rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;,
etc. (where antecedent and consequent occur at the same time). This
allows for the empirical possibility that a number of different
physical state kinds underlie the same mental state kind (for more on
this, see supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#MenAnoSemExt">B.2</a>).
 However, it also appears to suggest the existence of lawlike
relations between physical and mental properties, and so to be in
tension with mental anomalism. This issue will be explored in
 <a href="#SupConMenAno">&sect;5.3</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="ObjTokIde">5.2 Objections to Token Identity</h3>

<p>
The token-identity thesis has been the subject of a number of
interesting criticisms. Many of them, however, are difficult to bring
fully into contact with Davidson&rsquo;s own particular version of the
thesis, primarily because Davidson&rsquo;s version is derived <em>a
priori</em> from the other premises in his framework. So, for
instance, it has been argued that mental events cannot bear the burden
of the very precise spatiotemporal location of physical events that
they would need to if the former were genuinely identical to the
latter (Hornsby 1981; Leder 1985). For example, it would seem
arbitrary to identify the deduction of some conclusion from a chain of
reasoning with some particular neural event or set of neural events
occurring at a very specific time and place in the brain &ndash;
especially given the micro-precision of the neural framework. Compare
attempting to provide a physical description for the action of paying
back a debt &ndash; how does one determine its spatial and temporal
parameters with the precision demanded by the language of physics?
Distinguishing between &ldquo;the&rdquo; identified physical event, as
opposed to its close proximal causes and effects, can seem daunting if
not outright nonsensical (Leder 1985; see also di Pinedo 2006).
Further, it has been argued that the only possible empirical evidence
for specific token-identity claims could be type-identities between
either those or other mental and physical properties, because evidence
needs to be drawn from variant cases in order to sort out merely
coincident from actually identical events, and appeal to variant cases
depends upon type-identities (Leder 1985).</p>

<p>
Such criticisms become difficult to evaluate given Davidson&rsquo;s
<em>a priori</em> procedure for establishing the token-identity
thesis. He can respond that we already know, <em>a priori</em>, that
any particular mental event must instantiate some physical property if
it causally interacts with any mental or physical event, given the
cause-law and anomalism principles. Questions about how this physical
property, whatever it is, relates to properties currently invoked in
neuroscience come later and are necessarily secondary to this monistic
conclusion. And there is no guarantee (indeed, it is quite unlikely)
that neuroscientific properties currently in vogue are candidates for
strict-law properties. As we have just seen
 (<a href="#TokIde">&sect;5.1</a>),
 Davidson eventually came to explicitly associate the physical
properties that cover mental events with broad descriptions covering
large space-time regions. Further, it would confuse epistemology with
metaphysics to insist that, because we can only establish which
physical property some mental token event instantiates by leaning on
some type-correlations between other mental and physical properties,
token-identity claims therefore presuppose type-identity. How we
discover the particular physical properties is one thing; whether
there can be psychophysical laws is quite another, and not settled by
the method of discovery.</p>

<p>
We also need to keep in mind that Davidson embraces the possibility of
substantive mental-physical property correlations (<em>ceteris
paribus</em> psychophysical laws), which directly address these
epistemological issues. More generally, Davidson&rsquo;s
token-identity claim is that the predicates that come to form the
vocabulary of the as-yet unknown strict-law science will be capable of
being used to describe mental events. While we cannot judge this claim
by appealing to features of current neuroscience, it also seems that
it should be possible to adjudicate conceivability concerns. And,
putting aside Davidson&rsquo;s later views, while we are not currently
in the business of assigning fine-grained spatiotemporal parameters to
mental events, it does not seem obvious that we couldn&rsquo;t come to
accept such assignments on the basis of theoretical considerations
without thereby committing ourselves to the existence of
type-identities. However, Davidson&rsquo;s official position, early
and late, has always been that we do not need to be capable of making
such assignments in order to assert token-identity &ndash; there must
simply be such true assignments, and this is something we know on the
basis of a purely <em>a priori</em> argument. (Davidson 1999b; for
further discussion of this issue, see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#BarMat">A.3</a>);
 for a different criticism of token-identity, see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#OthPos">A.4</a>).
 For a criticism based upon Davidson&rsquo;s own treatment of causal
explanation, see Horgan and Tye 1985. For discussion of the criticism
that Davidson&rsquo;s monism is too weak to warrant the label
&lsquo;materialism&rsquo;, see supplement
 <a href="a-related-views.html#TokIdeMinMat">A.3.1</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="SupConMenAno">5.3 Is Supervenience Consistent with Mental Anomalism?</h3>

<p>
We have seen that Davidson supplements his monism with a claim of
supervenience. There are many different conceptions of the
supervenience relation (see Kim 1993b), and Davidson ultimately came
to identify his own version with what is called &ldquo;weak&rdquo;
supervenience, (Davidson 1993, fn. 4). Weak supervenience correlates
specific mental and physical properties within the actual world, but
allows for the possibility that if the past or the laws of nature were
different than they in fact are (i.e. in other possible worlds), the
very same physical properties might correlate with very different, or
even no, mental properties. (It should be noted that Davidson never
brought his views on supervenience into contact with his later views,
noted above in
 <a href="#TokIde">&sect;5.1</a>,
 about the broad nature of the physical properties that mental events
must instantiate according to Anomalous Monism. It is not at all clear
whether or how these views can be combined. In the following
discussion of supervenience, this complication will be ignored, and it
will be assumed that the physical properties in question are not of
this broad nature, since this is how Davidson&rsquo;s own discussions
of supervenience seem to proceed, and certainly what his critics
presuppose.)</p>

<p>
The puzzling aspect of Davidson&rsquo;s doctrine of supervenience that
arises within the framework of Anomalous Monism is that it appears to
entail that there will exist strict laws &ndash; supervenience laws
(see below) &ndash; on the basis of which mental events can be
predicted and explained that were supposed to be ruled out by the
anomalism principle. Davidson sometimes claims (Davidson 1995a, 266)
that supervenience is actually <em>entailed</em> by Anomalous Monism,
in which case it would then appear to follow that Anomalous Monism
itself is an inconsistent theory &ndash; entailing both that there
cannot be any strict psychophysical laws (the anomalism principle) and
that there must be such laws (supervenience). But generally his
position appears to be that Anomalous Monism is simply consistent with
supervenience (Davidson 1993, 7). If supervenience and Anomalous
Monism are indeed inconsistent with each other, and the former is
rejected, the question of the plausibility of a materialist position
with no discernible relation between mental and physical properties
arises (see supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#SupExpPriPhy">E.3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Why does supervenience appear to generate strict laws? When Davidson
first stated the supervenience claim, he articulated it in the
following terms: &ldquo;there cannot be two events alike in all
physical respects but differing in some mental respects&rdquo;
(Davidson 1970, 214)). This formulation appears to entail strict
psychophysical laws of the form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;. Davidson later came to focus on the
inversion of this formulation: &ldquo;if two events fail to share a
mental property, they will fail to share at least one physical
property&rdquo; (Davidson 1995a, 266). The advantage of this
reformulation is that it brings out the fact that the requisite
physical differences <em>need not be the same</em> in each case of
mental difference (see Davidson 1973a, 253&ndash;4). As Davidson
says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
although supervenience entails that any change in a mental property
<em>p</em> of a particular event <em>e</em> will be accompanied by a
change in the physical properties of <em>e</em>, it does not entail
that a change in <em>p</em> in other events will be accompanied by an
identical change in the physical properties of those other events.
Only the latter entailment would conflict with [Anomalous Monism].
(Davidson 1993, 7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There seem to be two problems here, however. First, the inverted
reformulation actually entails the original thesis &ndash; that if two
events share all physical properties they will share all mental
properties &ndash; and so once again appears to generate strict
psychophysical laws of the form &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;. Second, even if the accompanied
physical changes can be different, that simply generates <em>more</em>
strict psychophysical laws &ndash; &lsquo; <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>
&rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>
&rarr; <em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;, and so on. So it is hard to see
why Davidson thinks that the second formulation is consistent with the
anomalism principle.</p>

<p>
Some defenders of Davidson (Child 1992, 224; see also Davidson 1973,
258) have responded to the apparent tension between supervenience and
mental anomalism by emphasizing that the degree of detail that would
have to go into the formulation of such laws would make them useless
for prediction, since it is unlikely that the relevant initial
conditions will repeat. But as we have seen
 (<a href="#ConArg">&sect;4.1.4</a>),
 this seems to be true of any candidate for a strict law &ndash; it
must take into account all possible interfering conditions, and doing
so becomes quite unwieldy for generating predictions. And in any case,
such laws would still provide strict <em>explanations</em> of mental
events, contrary to Davidson&rsquo;s own formulation of mental
anomalism. So the problem that supervenience &lsquo;laws&rsquo; seem
to pose for the anomalism principle remains.</p>

<p>
Other defenders of Davidson (see Macdonalds 1986) have responded to
this problem by arguing that the existence of strict supervenience
laws is compatible with mental anomalism so long as we are not
actually able to <em>state</em> any such laws and thus be in a
position to <em>use</em> them to predict and explain actual mental
events &ndash; which is certainly the case currently and likely for
the foreseeable future. This suggestion deploys a reading of
Davidson&rsquo;s official statement of the anomalism principle &ndash;
which denies the possibility of strict laws on the basis of which
mental events <em>can be explained or predicted</em> &ndash; that
interprets &ldquo;<em>can</em>&rdquo; in a very demanding way, so as
to entail &ldquo;<em>currently</em>&rdquo;. If no one <em>currently
can state</em> true strict supervenience laws, then on this reading no
one &ldquo;<em>can</em>&rdquo; <em>explain or predict</em> mental
events on the basis of such laws, even though they <em>exist</em> in
the sense that the metaphysical facts entail them. Thus, such laws are
claimed to be compatible with the anomalism principle. But in
deploying this demanding reading of the principle, this strategy makes
Anomalous Monism into a much weaker position, dependent on the
cognitive limitations of human beings. It in effect becomes a
contingent epistemological position rather than the necessary
metaphysical doctrine it appears to be. Compare an analogous view,
epistemic freedom, which holds that we can understand ourselves to
choose freely so long as we do not know what the future contains, and
thus what we will choose &ndash; even if that future, and thus our
choice, is actually determined by past facts and the laws of nature
(see Kapitan 1986 for one version of this view, and for more general
discussion Nelkin 2004). &ldquo;Understanding ourselves to be
free&rdquo;, according to this view, is consistent with <em>not
actually</em> <em>being</em> free, because our choices are in fact
determined (for related discussion, see supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnomMoniFree">B.3</a>).
 Similarly, on the Macdonalds&rsquo; view, mental anomalism would be
consistent with the <em>existence</em> of actual strict psychophysical
laws that entail what we do and think. It also makes token-identity an
epistemic and not a metaphysical claim: it&rsquo;s not that mental
event tokens are actually identical to physical event tokens, but
instead that we can justifiably believe in such identities so long as
we are unable to exceptionlessly predict and explain mental events.
Neither view seems especially convincing given what is actually in
question. Each substitutes an epistemological issue for what
fundamentally seems to be a metaphysical issue.</p>

<p>
Davidson in one place offers a very different suggestion in response
to the problem. He claims that the supervenient relations between
mental and physical predicates that he envisages are of a <em>ceteris
paribus</em> nature. He accepts the requirement that any satisfactory
account of the relation between mental and physical properties must
permit appeal to local correlations and dependencies between specific
mental and physical properties (Davidson 1993, 9). But he blocks any
entailment from this requirement to strict psychophysical laws,
suggesting that such &lsquo;correlations&rsquo; and
&lsquo;dependencies&rsquo; are of a <em>ceteris paribus</em> form.</p>

<p>
Such a <em>ceteris paribus</em> conception of supervenience has not
been discussed in the extensive literature on the topic (its
possibility is recognized and endorsed by Kim 1995, 136; however, see
Kim 1993, 24&ndash;25) and it is unclear whether it can deliver a
suitably strong notion of dependency to satisfy materialist
intuitions. But it does seem to be an attractive way of reconciling
supervenience with mental anomalism so that Anomalous Monism remains a
consistent theory.</p>

<h2 id="EpiObj">6. The Epiphenomenalism Objections</h2>

<p>
It has been widely held that Anomalous Monism cannot avoid
epiphenomenalism &ndash; the view that mental events lack
causal/explanatory powers. At a first approximation, the concern
derives from a tension between mental anomalism and the apparently
privileged status assigned to physical properties in Davidson&rsquo;s
framework &ndash; in particular, that all events are physical, and all
physical events have a strict explanation in terms of other physical
events. It then becomes an important question what sort of
causal/explanatory role mental properties can play when all events
already have a physical explanation.</p>

<p>
Some welcome this result, holding that mental events explain actions
in a <em>sui generis</em> way not accountable for in the terms of
typical scientific explanations (see von Wright 1971; Stoutland 1976;
Wilson 1985; Ginet 1995; Campbell 1998 and 2005 and related discussion
in supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#ExpEpi">E.2</a>).
 Many, however, see this charge as devastating to the prospects of
Anomalous Monism&rsquo;s attempt to occupy a position between
reductionist materialism and dualism. Without a distinctive causal
role for mental events to play in the explanation of action, many
think that they would lack the sort of robust reality needed to
compete with reductionism and dualism, each of which, in its own
particular way, provides a clear causal role for mental events. On
this way of thinking, only causal powers can justify mental realism.
So if Anomalous Monism cannot avoid epiphenomenalism, it appears to
open the door to eliminative materialism, which holds that mental
vocabulary and explanations are vacuous and ought to be thrown out and
replaced by neuroscience (assuming, which seems extremely doubtful,
that neuroscience can itself supply strict laws &ndash; if not, then
this line of thought would lead to throwing out all but
&lsquo;physical&rsquo; strict law properties and explanations).</p>

<p>
As noted, the epiphenomenalist worry arises from two points that are
absolutely fundamental to Anomalous Monism &ndash; first, that mental
events are at the same time physical events, and, second, that while
mental predicates cannot figure into strict causal laws, physical
predicates must. Early critics moved quickly from these points to the
epiphenomenalist conclusion that mental properties are causally
irrelevant, because there are always strict law properties &ndash;
physical properties &ndash; to causally explain the occurrence of any
event. (For detailed discussion of this line of argument, see
supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#MenProCauRel">E.1</a>.)
 Among many other problems with this line of argument, however, there
is the one immediately capitalized on by Davidson: that within the
extensionalist metaphysical framework that Anomalous Monism is
developed
 (<a href="#MenPhyEve">&sect;2.1</a>
 above), properties <em>themselves</em> don&rsquo;t cause anything,
and so can be neither causally relevant nor irrelevant. According the
Davidson, only particular events &ndash; which <em>instantiate</em>
properties &ndash; are causal <em>relata</em>. Properties can figure
into laws and explanations, but laws and explanations concern how we
describe the events that stand in causal relations. (It should be
remembered, as noted in section
 <a href="#ArgForAnoMon">&sect;1</a>,
 that Davidson prefers to talk about predicates, but allows for a
loose equivalency between predictes, concepts, and properties except
when the metaphysics of causation is at issue.)</p>

<p>
Davidson expresses general skepticism about epiphenomenalist
objections to Anomalous Monism that depend on the idea that events
cause &lsquo;by virtue&rsquo; of the properties they instantiate
(Davidson 1993, 6, 13). This is closely connected to his sharp
distinction between causation &ndash; a metaphysical relation between
particular events independently of how they are described &ndash; and
explanation &ndash; which relates events only as they are described in
particular ways. But as we will now see, this doesn&rsquo;t end the
concerns about epiphenomenalism. (For related discussion concerning
epiphenomenalism and its bearing on the relationship between Anomalous
Monism and human freedom, see supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#AnomMoniContComp">B.3.2</a>)</p>
 
<p>
One point to note at the start of this discussion is that
Davidson&rsquo;s distinction between causation and explanation is
closely tied to his extensionalism about causation
 (<a href="#ArgForAnoMon">&sect;1</a>),
 which holds that there are events that stand in causal relations
independently of the terms we use to refer to them. This
extensionalism enables him to make sense of the idea that reasons
cause actions in the following way: Jane waved her hand because she
wanted to greet a friend, and this involves Jane&rsquo;s desire to
greet a friend causing her hand to wave, in the sense that there is a
causal relationship between an event that instantiates the property
<em>desires to greet a friend</em> and an event instantiating the
property <em>one&rsquo;s hand waves</em>, and those two properties
stand in an explanatory relationship of rationalization.
Epiphenomenalist critics often balk at this analysis, claiming that it
is an artificial and unconvincing way of making sense of the
commonsense idea that our reasons cause our actions to appeal to
metaphysical entities like events that take part in metaphyscial
processes such as instantiating properties that stand in rationalizing
relations to each other. Some insist that the causal relationship must
be between the mental <em>properties</em> in order to make sense of
the way we ordinarily think about psychological explanation. But their
way of making sense of the idea that reasons cause actions <em>is
equally artificial</em>: it says that there is a causal relationship
between the property <em>desires to greet a friend</em> and the
property <em>one&rsquo;s hand waves</em>, and that this causal
relationship underlies an explanatory relationship of rationalization
between them. But appealing to properties themselves, and causal
relations between them, is no less artificial and unconvincing. The
fact is that philosophical analyses of <em>anything</em> are often
artificial in these sorts of ways, because they parse common sense
notions (&ldquo;I waved my hand because I wanted to greet her&rdquo;)
into theoretical philosophical language. Artificiality of analysis is
therefore not a convincing objection to Davidson&rsquo;s view.</p>

<h3 id="MenProExpRel">6.1 Mental Properties and Explanatory Relevance</h3>

<p>
Critics of this extensionalist line of defense insisted that related
questions remained about Anomalous Monism even taking into account the
distinction between causation and explanation. In particular, they
questioned whether mental properties could play any genuine
explanatory role &ndash; whether they had <em>explanatory
relevance</em> &ndash; given the priority assigned to physical
properties in Davidson&rsquo;s framework. Why think that mental
properties explain anything given that the events which instantiate
them always also instantiate physical properties that figure in strict
causal laws? One key thought here is that genuine explanations require
laws, and mental anomalism, in ruling out strict psychological and
psychophysical laws, thus cannot account for any explanatory role for
mental properties regarding either physical or mental effects.</p>

<p>
In response, Davidson makes two points, the first concerning
<em>ceteris paribus</em> covering laws and the second concerning
supervenience. He notes that while Anomalous Monism rejects the
possibility of strict laws in which mental predicates can figure, it
allows for <em>ceteris paribus</em> psychological and psychophysical
laws (Davidson 1993, 9&ndash;12). His point appears to be that if
backing by law is sufficient for explanatory relevance, then mental
properties are explanatorily relevant because <em>ceteris paribus</em>
psychological and psychophysical are not only possible, they actually
play a clear role in how commonsense psychology functions, a point
that no one denies.</p>

<p>
This first point does not get developed by Davidson in any systematic
way, though it has been explored by others interested in defending
nonreductive monism from epiphenomenalist concerns. Some have focused
on exploiting <em>ceteris paribus</em> covering laws for
psychophysical causal relations, claiming that this allows mental
properties to be sufficient for their effects, thus providing the
needed type of explanatory role (McLaughlin 1989; Fodor 1989, 1991).
Others have attempted to sidestep the issue of covering laws entirely
by appealing directly to the truth of psychological and psychophysical
counterfactuals in grounding the explanatory role of mental properties
(LePore and Loewer 1987, 1989; Horgan 1989; Campbell 2010, 2020
develops an interventionist variant of this approach based on Woodward
2003).</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s second point, in response to concerns about the
explanatory relevance of mental properties, focuses on supervenience
(although as we will see, the possibility of <em>ceteris paribus</em>
laws may be relevant to his account). It is worth first noting that
both Davidson and his critics often slide between the issues and
language of causal relevance and explanatory relevance. Davidson
sometimes talks about causal efficacy because he is responding to
critics using such language. But given Davidson&rsquo;s hard
commitment to extensionalism about causation, and subsequent rejection
of the notion of properties having causal efficacy, one must interpret
some of his remarks so that they concern explanatory relevance. This
comes out in Davidson&rsquo;s appeals to the supervenience of mental
properties on physical properties in order to ground the explanatory
role of mental properties. Davidson says that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
properties are causally efficacious if they make a difference to what
<em>individual</em> events cause, and supervenience ensures that
mental properties do make a difference to what mental events cause.
(Davidson 1993, 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is because</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if two events differ in their psychological properties, they differ in
their physical properties (which we assume to be causally
efficacious). If supervenience holds, psychological properties make a
difference to the causal relations of an event, for they matter to the
physical properties, and the physical properties matter to causal
relations. (Davidson 1993, 14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sticking for the moment with Davidson&rsquo;s actual language, the
point here is not simply that mental properties inherit or piggyback
on the causal powers of the physical properties on which they
supervene &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t by itself establish a causal
role for mental properties themselves. Rather, Davidson appears to be
claiming that mental properties <em>influence</em> the causal powers
of their subvenient physical properties. And since physical properties
are assumed by Davidson&rsquo;s critics to be causally efficacious,
this is supposed to establish the causal efficacy of mental
properties. But since causation is, unlike supervenience, a temporal
relation between events, and because Davidson&rsquo;s official
extensionalist position rejects the very idea of property causation,
the notion of influence here must be understood in terms of
explanatory relevance: mental properties are explanatorily relevant,
on this view, to the physical properties that they supervene on
because mental properties somehow <em>explain</em> those subvenient
physical properties. And since physical properties are assumed by all
parties to be explanatorily relevant because of their primacy, this is
supposed to establish the explanatory relevance of mental properties
in the physical world.</p>

<p>
One problem with Davidson&rsquo;s claim here is its reversal of the
dependency relationship between mental and physical properties that is
typically claimed in supervenience relationships. A central rationale
for positing supervenience is to mark a kind of explanatory primacy to
the subvenient properties (see supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#SupExpPriPhy">E.3</a>).
 And this is reflected in the first part of Davidson&rsquo;s
formulation above &ndash; surely a difference in psychological
properties entails (requires) a difference in physical properties
<em>because</em> the difference in physical properties is needed in
order <em>account for</em> the difference in psychological properties.
So the sense in which psychological properties &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to
physical properties is that changing the former amounts to a change in
the latter <em>because</em> a change in the latter explains a change
in the former. This, however, does not appear to be helpful in
establishing the explanatory relevance of mental properties. It gets
the cart before the horse, so to speak.</p>

<p>
Another problem, discussed above
 (<a href="#SupConMenAno">&sect;5.3</a>),
 is that it is difficult to see how a supervenience relation of
sufficient power to make mental properties explanatory of an
event&rsquo;s physical properties in the way Davidson seems to suggest
does not issue in strict laws. Because it is unclear how supervenience
is consistent with the anomalism principle, it is also unclear how it
can help block epiphenomenalist concerns. We did, however, previously
note one potentially worthwhile but unexplored possibility &ndash; a
<em>ceteris paribus</em> supervenience relation &ndash; which Davidson
endorses, that may help with this.</p>

<h3 id="ExpExcIntRelDuaExpStr">6.2 Explanatory Exclusion, Interest-Relativity and the Dual <em>Explananda</em> Strategy</h3>

<p>
Kim has explored a related but different route from Anomalous Monism
to mental epiphenomenalism &ndash; the problem of explanatory
exclusion (Kim 1989, 44). A causal explanation of an event cites a
sufficient condition for that event&rsquo;s occurrence. This
sufficiency seems to exclude the possibility of other independent
causes or explanations of that event. So if, as Anomalous Monism
entails, physics can provide a sufficient explanation of any
particular event, there appears to be no room for an independent and
irreducible mental explanation of an event (Davidson 1993, 15). It is
because the cause instantiated some particular physical property that
the effect (which happens to instantiate a mental property) came
about. Any mental properties that the cause instantiates seem
superfluous in explaining why the effect occurred &ndash; unless those
properties are identical or related in some strict lawlike way to the
physical properties, something ruled out by the anomalism
principle.</p>

<p>
Davidson responds by arguing that citing only the physical properties
of the cause to provide a sufficient explanation of an action does not
address the particular interests that psychological explanations of
actions serve &ndash; providing the reasons of the agent in light of
which she performed the action that she did. Serving these explanatory
interests compensates for the fact that such explanations cannot be
sharpened into strict laws or folded neatly into physical laws
(Davidson 1991, 163). We only understand why the agent <em>waved her
hand</em> &ndash; why the effect is of the mental kind &lsquo;waving
one&rsquo;s hand&rsquo; (as opposed to merely &lsquo;one&rsquo;s hand
going up and down&rsquo;) &ndash; by citing <em>mental</em> properties
of the causing event, such as her wanting to greet her friend. The
citation of physical properties of the causing event and the
associated mere bodily movement will not bring about such
understanding, assuming mental anomalism, because of the lack of any
reductive relationship between either the physical properties of the
cause and the agent&rsquo;s reasons or the physical properties of the
effect and the agent&rsquo;s action. And those physical properties
will not explain why the agent was performing the intentional action
of waving her hand. They will not make the action intelligible.</p>

<p>
Here we see the interest-relativity of explanation and its bearing on
explanatory relevance (see supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#MenProCauRel">E.1</a>)
 playing an important role for Davidson. Mental properties must be
cited if we want a <em>rational</em> explanation of <em>mental</em>
effects. Davidson&rsquo;s response to epiphenomenalist concerns, and
the explanatory exclusion problem posed by Kim, can thus be described
as a kind of &lsquo;dual <em>explananda</em>&rsquo; theory of the
explanatory role of mental properties. According to this theory, for
every (causally interacting) mental event there are generally at least
two distinct <em>explananda</em> in need of explanation: an event of a
certain physical type and an event of a certain mental type. Mental
properties are accorded an ineliminable and (given Anomalous Monism)
irreducible explanatory role by virtue of their singular capacity to
make intelligible the occurrence of other mental properties through
the <em>sui generis</em> relation of rationalization. This reflects
the point made at the end of
 <a href="#CauDefArg">&sect;4.2</a>
 by the causal definition interpretation of the argument for mental
anomalism: that rationality underlies, not mental anomalism, but
rather mental realism. (For related discussion of the dual
<em>explananda</em> approach, see Macdonalds 1995 and Gibbons 2006.)
On this view, to the extent that we believe there are actions and
thoughts to be explained at all, we must attribute an explanatory role
to mental properties of their causes, since only these provide the
sort of explanation &ndash; through rationalization &ndash; that makes
them intelligible to us in the way that we need in order to understand
them. Citation of physical properties of the causes just does not
provide for such understanding. It can explain the physical properties
of the effect (one of the dual <em>explananda)</em> but as a general
rule cannot provide illumination or intelligibility of the kind needed
for understanding the mental properties of the effect. If you asked
someone why she raised her hand and she responded &ldquo;Because
activity in my brain resulted in muscle contractions leading to my
hand moving as it did&rdquo;, you would rightly be mystified and think
your question hadn&rsquo;t been answered. Her response did not make
her <em>action</em> intelligible.</p>

<p>
It should be noted, however, that there are cases where mental
properties do appear to explain physical properties and vice-versa. To
deny this would lead to an &ldquo;outlet&rdquo; problem, with mental
properties being explanatorily insulated from physical properties
&ndash; something inconsistent with the way in which we ordinarily
think of mental-physical interaction, captured in Davidson&rsquo;s
interaction principle
 (<a href="#MenPhyEve">&sect;2</a>)
 (for discussion of the outlet problem, see Gibbons 2006). A blow to
the head can, for instance, sometimes explain the occurrence of a
thought popping into one&rsquo;s head. And a thought can explain the
physical behavior of an object, as when my decision to quench my
thirst leads to the movement of a glass of water to my lips. However,
the blow to the head cannot rationalize the thought &ndash; it
can&rsquo;t explain its content, only the fact that an event which
happens to have that content occurred. And the decision to drink
cannot rationalize the movement of the glass, though it can
rationalize the <em>action</em> of <em>moving</em> the glass. The dual
<em>explananda</em> strategy is silent concerning such cases, and more
work is needed to account for how such cross-level causal explanatory
cases can be squared with Kim&rsquo;s explanatory exclusion principle.
(For a critique of Kim&rsquo;s principle based on a very different
conception of causal explanation, see Campbell 2020,
156&ndash;157.)</p>

<p>
Moreover, scientific research suggests that thoughts are able to
explain bodily effects like stress, and perhaps even the cessation of
pain and bodily injury &ndash; as in the placebo effect (for a
fascinating study of such cases summarizing decades of research and
experiments, see Langer 2023). And brain injuries and diseases can
explain psychiatric phenomena such as hearing voices in one&rsquo;s
head, or delusions such as Capgras syndrome, where one believes that
one&rsquo;s spouse has been replaced by an imposter. (For excellent
discussion questioning whether such phenomena can be explained without
any appeal to mental properties, see Campbell 2001; Campbell 2009
contains related useful discussion.) More work is needed to see
whether the dual <em>explananda</em> strategy can account for such
psychological phenomena.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, so long as there are occurrences of mental properties in
need of the distinctive kind of explanation provided by
rationalization, mental properties occupy an ineliminable explanatory
role. And given Anomalous Monism, that role is irreducible. It is
worth noting that this dual <em>explananda</em> strategy is consistent
with Davidson&rsquo;s commitment to the causal closure of the physical
domain (Crane 1995 seems to miss this point) &ndash; every physical
event can have a physical explanation, even if the mental component of
some physical events can be rationally explained only through appeal
to mental components of the causing event. Therefore, however causal
closure ultimately enters into Anomalous Monism (see supplement
 <a href="c-laws-of-nature.html#CauCloPhyArgForMon">C.1</a>),
 it does not appear to create any further problems for Anomalous
Monism&rsquo;s ability to account for the ineliminable, irreducible
explanatory role of mental properties.</p>

<p>
The interest-relativity of causal explanation is thus crucial in
Davidson&rsquo;s grounding of the ineliminable explanatory role of
mental properties within the framework of Anomalous Monism. As we have
seen
 (<a href="#MenCau">&sect;2.2</a>,
 <a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>), Anomalous Monism contends that <em>all</em> mental
properties, including mental event-types such as actions, are not
reducible to physical-event types. Therefore, the only way to explain
actions (as opposed to mere bodily movements) so as to make them
<em>intelligible</em> &ndash; to meet that explanatory interest
&ndash; is by appeal to the mental properties of the cause. These
properties are the reasons &ndash; beliefs, desires, intentions
&ndash; that we appeal to in everyday psychological explanations. (For
discussion of whether, in light of this, reason explanations can still
be maintained to be <em>causal</em> explanations within the framework
of Anomalous Monism, see supplement
 <a href="e-mental-causation-supervenience.html#ExpEpi">E.2</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="CauConRea">6.3 The Causal Constitution of Reasons</h3>

<p>
A final point to consider in evaluating the epiphenomenalist
objections to Anomalous Monism is the way in which causality enters
into the constitution of reasons and reasons-explanations according to
Davidson. Before we have established the anomalism principle, or go on
to derive monism, we already know that reasons explain actions by
causing them (the &lsquo;because&rsquo; problem discussed in
 <a href="#MenCau">&sect;2.2</a>).
 And, as we have seen
 (<a href="#CauDefArg">&sect;4.2</a>),
 we know that propositional attitudes and mental contents are
individuated, and thus defined, partially in terms of what they are
caused by and cause (for attitudes, see Davidson 1987b, 41; for
contents, see Davidson 1987a, 444, and extended discussion in
supplement
 <a href="b-related-issues.html#MenAnoSemExt">B.2</a>).
 But if something cannot even be identified as a reason unless it is a
cause, then the charge that mental properties are causally impotent
appears to have difficulty gaining traction. And since these claims
are known prior to the argument for monism, they are neutral about
whatever else reasons must be in order to be causes. So reasons must
be recognized as causes prior to the discovery, through
Davidson&rsquo;s argument for monism, that they are also physical
events. This appears to secure the causal potency of reasons in a way
entirely independent of the claim of token-identity.</p>

<p>
This widely unrecognised point can be put this way: before even
<em>addressing</em> the quesiton of whether mental events are
identical, at either the type or token level, to physical events, we
must first know what individuates mental events &ndash; what makes an
event a <em>mental</em> event. Davidson argues that part of what
identifies events as mental is their causal nature. Within
Davidson&rsquo;s framework, reasons can only play the rationalizing
and explanatory role that they do by virtue of their causal nature.
Davidson only <em>then</em> argues, partly on the basis of this, that
mental events are token-identical to physical events, by appeal to the
anomalism and cause-law principles. Davidson has therefore entitled
himself to the claim that mental events cause and are caused by
physical events before the question of how mental properties can be
causally efficacious or relevant can even be raised by
epiphenomenalist critics. Their concern about the causal potency of
mental events is a reaction to the anomalism principle&rsquo;s
rejection of type-identity, and the subsequent derivation of
token-identity through the cause-law principle. But this rejection and
derivation <em>assumes</em> the causal potency of mental events, as
part of what identifies an event as mental in the first place.</p>

<p>
Practically all of Anomalous Monism&rsquo;s epiphenomenalist critics
do not address this rich causal background, in particular the role of
causation in individuating mental properties. As we have seen, the
background is not sufficient by itself to silence all epiphenomenalist
concerns. But it does significantly affect how those concerns can be
formulated and addressed. Anomalous Monism is clearly deeply
committed, at a number of levels, to the causal explanatory relevance
of the mental, and so charity suggests that we try to understood it in
a way such that these commitments are respected. The dual
<em>explananda</em> strategy discussed above
 (<a href="#ExpExcIntRelDuaExpStr">&sect;6.2</a>)
 provides one promising framework for doing this, while at the same
time displaying sensitivity to the sorts of concerns driving the
epiphenomenalist objections.</p>

<p>
Related to the point that causality enters into the constitution of
reasons and reasons-explanations is that, for Davidson, there can be
no sharp divide between how one <em>ought</em> to think and act and
how one <em>in fact</em> thinks and acts (see
 <a href="#PreIIIAnoPri">&sect;4</a>,
 <a href="#RatArg">&sect;4.1</a> and supplement
 <a href="d-mental-anomalism.html#RatConMenIrrMenAno">D.8</a>).
 This constitutive conception of rationality complements the causal
constitution of reasons: just as something cannot be identified as a
reason unless it&rsquo;s a cause, similarly a thought or action cannot
generally be identified as the causal upshot of a reason unless it
bears a rational relation to it. The psychological causal order must
contain predominately rational patterns. On Davidson&rsquo;s view,
therefore, one cannot neatly cleave apart the space of reasons from
the space of causes in order to raise a skeptical question about
whether and how those spaces can intersect. That is how most
epiphenomenalist critics of Anomalous Monism proceed, and it ignores
the frameworks of causation and rationality upon which Anomalous
Monism is erected.</p>

<h2 id="Con">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Despite the initial appearance of simplicity in its assumptions,
structure and argumentation, we have turned up several important
problems and lacunae that stand in the way of any overall final
assessment of the plausibility of Anomalous Monism. While the central
objections it has faced have derived from epiphenomenalist concerns,
the force of these objections is not clear. Arguably, the most serious
difficulties for Anomalous Monism are not with its adequacy but with
its justification. We still stand in need of a clear argument for how
rationality leads to the anomalism principle; there are the
substantial problems surrounding the status of the causal closure of
the physical and its bearing on monism; and the cause-law
principle&rsquo;s strictness requirement is still in need of a
compelling rationale. Even with these problems, Anomalous Monism
continues to provide an extraordinarily rich and useful framework for
exploring fundamental issues and problems in the philosophy of mind,
and has earned a central and permanent place on the rather short list
of genuinely important positions concerning the relation between
mental and physical events and properties.</p>
