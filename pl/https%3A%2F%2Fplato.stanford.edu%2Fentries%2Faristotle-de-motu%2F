<h1>Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De Motu Animalium</em></h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 3, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On the motion of animals</em> (<em>De motu
animalium</em>, <em>Mot. An.</em>) is a short but densely written
zoological treatise of a mere seven Bekker pages in length (which is
to say about 20 pages in an average modern translation). It is devoted
to an important philosophical question, namely the question of
&ldquo;how the soul moves the body&rdquo; (<em>Mot. An.</em> 6,
700b9&ndash;10), which Aristotle declares &ldquo;a most difficult
problem&rdquo; in his <em>Physics</em> (<em>Phys.</em> VIII, 2,
253a7&ndash;11). In order to address the problem adequately, <em>Mot.
An.</em> makes use of the full spectrum of conceptual resources that
Aristotle&rsquo;s mature philosophy of nature has to offer. The result
is his <em>general theory of animal self-motion</em> (Corcilius
2008a). The theory offers &ndash; according to Aristotle&rsquo;s
standards &ndash; a scientific explanation of the efficient causation
of animal self-motion. It does so by offering an account of how the
soul sets the body into motion. The theory combines theoretical
elements of Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy of nature, most notably his
hylomorphism and his cardiocentrism, which many scholars in the late
nineteenth and twentieth centuries thought were inconsistent with each
other. This combination of seemingly incompatible theoretical elements
was one of the main reasons why <em>Mot. An.</em> was believed to be
inauthentic for a long time, until Farquharson (1912), Jaeger (1913),
and then later Nussbaum (1978) put its authenticity beyond doubt (Rapp
2020: 13&ndash;17). Still, <em>Mot. An.</em> is a challenging treatise
and the account of animal self-motion it proposes has not been
properly understood until fairly recently. This is so not only because
it is difficult to see whether, and if so how exactly,
Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphic theory of the soul can accommodate an
efficient causal role for the soul in episodes of animal self-motion,
but also because the account operates at an unusually high level of
zoological abstraction. Aristotle offers a &ldquo;common
account&rdquo; that covers all kinds of animal self-motion, from the
rational self-movements of human agents down to the self-locomotion of
the humblest insects. From today&rsquo;s perspective, we may say that
the theory touches on core issues in theoretical domains as diverse as
zoology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, moral psychology,
and human biology. This high level of theoretical abstraction has led
to misunderstandings about the scope and character of
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory. A further obstacle to its ready
accessibility for uninitiated readers is the fact that <em>Mot.
An.</em> is not a self-standing treatise. It is part of
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy of nature, which means that it builds on
Aristotle&rsquo;s previous and no less difficult discussion of the
principle of animal self-motion in his work <em>On the Soul</em> or
<em>De anima</em> (<em>An.</em> III 9&ndash;11). An adequate
interpretation of <em>Mot. An.</em> therefore depends on the
interpretation of other so-called psychological and biological works.
However, unfortunately, for varying reasons modern interpreters argued
for an incompatibility of the theories in <em>An.</em> III 9&ndash;11
and <em>Mot. An.</em> (Nussbaum 1983: 135&ndash;136, and Kollesch
1985: 58&ndash;59). It further adds to its inaccessibility that
<em>Mot. An.</em> stands in complex relations to other parts of
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy. It contains references to diverse areas
of Aristotle&rsquo;s oeuvre and discusses questions of cosmological
and even metaphysical order that in one way or the other relate to his
theory of animal self-motion (especially in chapters 3&ndash;4 and 6).
Most importantly perhaps, the theory of animal self-motion in <em>Mot.
An.</em> seems to be relevant for Aristotle&rsquo;s account of human
action and moral responsibility developed in his works on moral
philosophy. This holds especially for the so-called &ldquo;practical
syllogism&rdquo; which is formally introduced in chapter 7 of our
treatise. All of this makes <em>Mot. An.</em> a fascinating treatise
not just for the scientific explanation of animal self-motion, but for
general philosophical reasons as well. As the treatise contains many
more or less explicit references to his <em>Physics</em>, <em>De
caelo</em>, <em>On the Soul</em>, his zoological corpus, his moral
philosophy, and his <em>Metaphysics</em> (for a full list of
references see D&uuml;ring 1966: 296), it is likely that the treatise
was written at a late point in Aristotle&rsquo;s career. This entry
addresses the following issues.</p>

<h2 id="SubjMattBasiCharArisTheoAnimSelfMoti">1. Subject matter and basic character of Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of animal self-motion</h2>

<p>
The account of animal self-motion in <em>Mot. An.</em> is devoted to
the explanation of the voluntary self-movements of animals. Although
Aristotle particularly emphasizes the motion of the animal as a whole
from place to place, it is pretty clear that he counts the movements
of bodily parts, such as the purposeful lifting of an arm, as
voluntary self-motions as well; indeed, in chapter 7, Aristotle even
introduces staying put as an example of self-motion (701a7&ndash;16).
More precisely, what <em>Mot. An.</em> is concerned with is the
<em>common cause of the movement of animals</em> (1, 698a4&ndash;7; 6,
700b9&ndash;11). &ldquo;Common cause&rdquo; here indicates that
Aristotle does not ask his question of how the soul moves the body
with a view to the self-motions of humans or any other species in
particular but with a view to the self-motions of all animals capable
of moving themselves. His answer is stated in his <em>general theory
of animal self-motion</em>. This theory is an according to
Aristotle&rsquo;s standards scientific explanation of the movements of
all animals that are capable of moving themselves from one place to
the other. Since the <em lang="la">explananda</em> in view concern all
the various ways of moving from place to place such as flying,
swimming, walking, crawling, hopping, and the like, this theory
displays an unusually high level of zoological abstraction, one that
cuts across fundamental taxonomical distinctions such as that between
animals with spines and animals without (<em>Mot. An.</em> 9,
702b18&ndash;20). <em>Mot. An.</em> is not so much interested in the
particular features of the movements of flying, swimming, crawling or
walking animals. Aristotle has already dealt with the different ways
in which the various kinds of living beings realize their movements
from place to place with the aid of their limbs in his short work
<em>On the Progression of Animals</em> (<em>De incessu animalium</em>,
which he refers to at the beginning of <em>Mot. An.</em> 1,
698a1&ndash;4; on the <em>De incessu</em>, see Falcon &amp;
Stavrianeas 2021); rather, what <em>Mot. An.</em> is interested in is
what all these particular kinds of movement share as their
<em>common</em> efficient cause (cp. the methodological discussion in
the Parts of Animals (<em>Part. An.</em>) I 1, 639a15&ndash;b5, and
the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> (<em>Anal. Post.</em>) I 4,
73b25-74a3; II 14, 98a20&ndash;23, which emphasize that scientific
explanations ought to be given on a &ldquo;commensurate
universal&rdquo; level, on which see Corcilius 2020: 316). This common
cause is the mechanism by which the &ldquo;soul moves the body&rdquo;,
which is to say the mechanism by which cognition moves the animal from
place to place. As the theory covers the entire range of animal and
human self-motion, the <em>philosophical</em> issue behind the
<em>Mot. An.</em>&rsquo;s question of how the soul moves the body is
the issue of the basic nature of animal and human action. To
appreciate the character and importance of that question for
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy we should broaden our perspective for a
moment and go beyond the contents of <em>Mot. An.</em></p>

<h3 id="TaskBasiIdeaTheoProbSelfMotiArisSolu">1.1 The task and basic idea of the theory: the problem of self-motion and Aristotle&rsquo;s solution</h3>

<p>
It is characteristic of living things that they are able not only to
set other things in motion, but to set themselves in motion as well.
Self-motion is one of the main characteristic phenomena of living
things (<em>An.</em> II 2, 413a22&ndash;25). According to
Aristotle&rsquo;s understanding of it, which he seems to share with
his predecessors, &ldquo;self-motion&rdquo; means to move something in
the transitive sense of &lsquo;move&rsquo;, that is, to set something
in motion&mdash;except in this case this something is not outside the
animal but is rather the animal itself. This, however, seems
paradoxical: how can anything transitively set itself in motion?</p>

<p>
This is the <em>problem</em> of self-motion (Corcilius 2021). The
problem of self-motion is a question already raised by
Aristotle&rsquo;s predecessors. They offered different, and sometimes
even contradictory, answers. Notwithstanding their differences,
however, there is some common ground. The predecessors agreed, for
example, that self-motion is a phenomenon of such a special quality
that its originators&mdash;the self-movers&mdash;must be attributed
special features: only living beings, i.e., beings endowed with a
soul, are capable of self-motion. The predecessors also agreed that
self-motion is a process in which the soul sets the body into motion.
Hence, Aristotle&rsquo;s predecessors basically agreed in dividing
self-movers into two parts&mdash;&ldquo;body&rdquo; and
&ldquo;soul&rdquo;&mdash;and they also agreed in attributing the
active role of setting the body into motion to one of them, namely to
the soul (see Aristotle&rsquo;s report about his predecessors in
<em>An.</em> I 2, 403b24&ndash;404b8). At first sight,
Aristotle&rsquo;s own solution does not look so different from that of
his predecessors. He agrees that only what is alive and endowed with
soul is capable of setting itself into motion (<em>Phys.</em> VIII 4,
255a5&ndash;18; <em>Mot. An.</em> 6, 700b11&ndash;13) and he also
basically agrees that animal self-motion is a process in which
something inside the animal which is distinct from the body sets the
body into motion (<em>Mot. An.</em> 4, 700a6&ndash;11), even though,
as he emphasizes, it is very difficult to see just how exactly to
distinguish between the moving and the moved part (<em>Phys.</em> VIII
4, 254b28&ndash;33). This is a question that Aristotle addresses only
in <em>Mot. An.</em> 9, as we will see below. However, his idea of
<em>how</em> this happens is very different from that of his
predecessors. In any case, with the distinction between soul and body
as moving and moved part in place, the fact that something sets itself
transitively in motion looks less paradoxical, given that it is no
longer one and the same item which sets itself in motion but
<em>something</em> within the living being&mdash;the soul&mdash;that
sets something <em>else</em> in motion&mdash;the body. In this regard
it is striking that Aristotle strongly underlines the separation of
active mover and passively moved body. As the newly established Greek
text by Primavesi shows, in the <em>Mot. An.</em> he does not use the
otherwise idiomatic locution &ldquo;self-motion&rdquo;, preferring the
somewhat clumsy, albeit more precise, two-place reflexive expression
&ldquo;moving oneself by oneself (<em lang="grc">auto hauto
kinein</em>)&rdquo; in its stead, leaving the subject expression
&ldquo;auto&rdquo; rigidly in the nominative regardless of syntactic
context (Primavesi &amp; Corcilius 2018: cxl; Rapp &amp; Primavesi
2020, 134). Aristotle thus clearly distinguishes between the active
subject and the passive object of movement already at a linguistic
level. This corresponds to the fundamental importance of the
distinction between the mover (soul) and the moved (body) for his
account. But, of course, the internal distinction between a moving and
a moved part can only be a preliminary solution. For at once a new and
no less difficult question arises: <em>how</em> can the soul set the
body in motion? This is precisely the problem Aristotle purports to
address in <em>Mot. An.</em> (6, 700b9&ndash;11; see 1,
698a4&ndash;14).</p>

<p>
Note that for Aristotle the question poses itself under particularly
stringent conditions, unlike for his predecessors. His predecessors
started out from the assumption that nothing which is not itself in
motion is capable of setting something else in motion. As Aristotle
says, this is why they attributed motion to the soul, conceiving of it
as something that is in motion itself (<em>An.</em> I 2, 403b30ff).
For them, therefore, the task of explaining animal self-motion
basically consisted only in showing how the soul, as something which
is already itself in motion, transmits its own movements to the body.
This &ldquo;easy&rdquo; way of accounting for animal self-motion is
not open to Aristotle because of two of his other theoretical
commitments. On the one hand, he subscribes to a conception of the
soul according to which the soul is not materially extended.
Therefore, for him&mdash;in contrast to most of his
predecessors&mdash;the soul is not the <em>kind</em> of thing to
undergo motion nor, indeed, to undergo, experience or suffer anything.
Aristotle conceives of the soul as something <em>of</em> animated
bodies, namely as their <em>principle</em> which explains what they
are, do and undergo. He defines the soul as the &ldquo;substantial
being according to the definition&rdquo; of the living body (<em lang="grc">ousia
kata ton logon</em>: <em>An.</em> II 1, 412b10f).
Later in his treatise on the soul Aristotle defines the soul as the
sum of the basic vital functions animated bodies possess insofar as
they are alive. These basic vital functions are the so-called
&ldquo;powers of the soul (<em lang="grc">dynameis t&ecirc;s
psyches</em>)&rdquo;, namely vegetative self-preservation, perception,
and the capacity for thinking (Corcilius &amp; Gregoric 2010; Johansen
2012). Unlike bodies, vital functions are not materially extended.
This is why the soul is not the right <em>kind</em> of thing to be
moved (Aristotle argues for that thesis at length in <em>An.</em> I
2sq., 405b31&ndash;407b11; 4&ndash;5, 408a30&ndash;409b18). The other
theoretical commitment that aggravates the problem of self-motion for
Aristotle stems from his general kinematics in <em>Physics</em> VIII.
It bars him from explaining animal self-motion by the aid of a
self-moving soul. In <em>Physics</em> VIII he argues that self-motion
in the strict sense (<em>X</em> sets <em>X</em> in motion) is an
impossibility. There must always be some one item <em>X</em> which
sets some other item <em>Y</em> in motion, and <em>X</em> and
<em>Y</em> must necessarily be distinct from each other. For any
movement there must be an origin&mdash;a mover&mdash;distinct from
what it moves. In his <em>Physics</em> Aristotle thus dissolves the
concept of strict self-motion (which seems to originate in Plato,
<em>Phaedrus</em> 245c&ndash;246a; <em>Laws</em> X 895e&ndash;896a)
into a <em>system</em> of movement consisting of at least two distinct
elements, namely a passive moved thing and an active mover
(<em>Phys.</em> VIII 4, 255a12&ndash;19; 5, 257a33&ndash;b27, with
application to self-movers: 4, 254b27&ndash;33). This commits him to
the thesis that the causation of movement is always transitive,
including the so-called self-motion of animals. These two theoretical
commitments&mdash;the immovable soul and the transitivity of
self-motion&mdash;present Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of animal
self-motion with a formidable challenge. He must show how the
immovable soul sets the body in motion. This is why he says that the
explanation of animal self-motion is &ldquo;a most difficult
problem&rdquo; (<em>Phys.</em> VIII 2, 253a7&ndash;11). In what
follows, we will describe Aristotle&rsquo;s solution to the problem as
it emerges from his writings (for competing approaches see below).</p>

<h3 id="SoluActuPercSoulUnmoMoveBody">1.2 Solution: the actuality of the perceptual soul as the unmoved mover of the body</h3>

<p>
Aristotle rises to the challenge with the introduction of a highly
innovative bio-mechanical conception of the causation of movement. By
combining teleological with kinematic theoretical elements, he
conceives of the soul as the <em>unmoved mover</em> of the living
body. According to this conception, in the simplest cases the
causation of animal self-motion consists in a three-stage process.</p>

<p id="stage1">
<em>Stage 1</em> is <em>the unmoved mover</em>. This stage consists in
the perception of an external object by an animal, which is also an
object of the animal&rsquo;s desire. As perception is a basic vital
function of animals and hence a part of the soul, it follows that the
actuality of perception of an external object is a psychic act.
Perception involves the <em>actuality of the perceptual soul</em>. And
as Aristotle does not conceive of the soul as a possible bearer of
mental states&mdash;only the living being can be a bearer of
affections and mental states &ldquo;in virtue of its soul
&rdquo;&mdash;the soul is itself not in any way moved or changed
during the act of perception (<em>An.</em> I 4, 408b5&ndash;18). The
actuality of the perceptual soul therefore can act as the unmoved
mover of an ensuing physiological process in the animal body, and this
process in turn can issue in the self-motion of the animal as a whole
(on the actuality of the perceptual soul &ldquo;without coming to be
or passing away&rdquo;, see Corcilius 2025).</p>

<p id="stage2">
<em>Stage 2</em> is <em>the moved mover</em>. This stage is the
internal process of the <em>animal&rsquo;s physical reaction to the
object</em> presented to it by perception. It is here that
Aristotle&rsquo;s natural teleological conceptions of the living body,
of pleasure and pain and of appetitive desire from his work <em>On the
Soul</em> (<em>De anima</em>) exert their explanatory force. As the
animal body is an instrument, or tool, of the soul (<em>An.</em> II 1,
412a27&ndash;b6), it will react to the perception of external objects
in ways that preserve the soul&rsquo;s (and thereby also the
animal&rsquo;s) functions: if a perceived object is conducive to the
animal&rsquo;s self-preservation, its perception will be pleasant for
the animal, and if a perceived object is detrimental for its
self-preservation, its perception will be painful. On
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory, what is conducive to an animal&rsquo;s
self-preservation is &ldquo;in accordance with its nature&rdquo; and
hence <em>biologically good</em> for it, while what is detrimental to
its self-preservation is <em>biologically bad</em> for it. In
Aristotle&rsquo;s natural teleology, animals feel pleasure whenever
what they perceive is in accordance with their nature (<em>Hist.
An.</em> IX 1, 589a8&ndash;9), and they feel pain whenever what they
perceive is against their nature and hence biologically bad for them;
indeed, on Aristotle&rsquo;s account, pleasure and pain, in the most
basic form they take in nature, <em>are</em> perceptions of objects
that are in this biological way either good or bad for the perceiving
animal insofar as they are such (<em>An.</em> III 7, 431a8&ndash;14;
cp. <em>EN</em> VI 2, 1139a21&ndash;22); and pleasure and pain, for
their part, are necessary and sufficient for corresponding desires,
i.e., they are necessary and sufficient for the pursuit of pleasant
objects and the avoidance of painful ones. Animals by their natures
pursue what is conducive to their biological self-preservation and
avoid what is detrimental to it (<em>An.</em> III 7, 431a8&ndash;14;
<em>An.</em> II 3, 413b22&ndash;24, 414b1&ndash;16; cp. <em>De
somn.</em> 1, 454b29&ndash;31; on Aristotle&rsquo;s biological
conception of pleasure and pain and non-rational desire, see Corcilius
&amp; Gregoric 2013; cp. Richardson 1992: 395). The second moved mover
stage in the process of animal self-motion thus consists in the
physical reaction of the (natural-teleologically oriented)
instrumental body to the object of desire as it is presented to the
animal by perception. In other words, the perception of an object of
desire triggers a self-preserving physical reaction of the
animal&rsquo;s instrumental body, the first manifestation of which is
the activity of desire. On Aristotle&rsquo;s account, desire
materially consists of certain thermic discharges in the body: if the
perceived object is pleasant, the body will tend to produce internal
heat; if painful, it will tend to produce a chilling effect. Aristotle
calls these endogenous thermal bodily reactions &ldquo;desire&rdquo;
(<em lang="grc">orexis</em>, see <em>Mot. An.</em> 7,
701b33&ndash;702a21; cp. <em>An.</em> I 1, 403a25&ndash;403b1). Note,
however, that desire is not just a thermic reaction to a perceived
object; it crucially involves also the perception of the object. In
more complex cases, higher cognitive functions such as mental
representation, anticipation, memory, and even rational thinking can
take the place of perception, and also other kinds of desire can take
the place of biologically basic appetitive desire (<em>Mot. An.</em>
6, 700b17&ndash;24). Desire&rsquo;s thermic discharge in turn triggers
a chain of processes that run unconsciously inside the body and
produce the mechanical forces that set into motion the animal&rsquo;s
limbs and ultimately the animal as a whole.</p>

<p id="stage3">
<em>Stage 3</em> of the process is the <em>moved thing</em>, i.e., the
movement of the animal body from place to place in direction of the
desired objects as it results from the above causal chain of inner
bodily processes in stage 2.</p>

<p>
Stage 1 is explained in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De anima</em> and
briefly summarized in <em>De motu animalium</em> 6, stages 2 and 3 are
explained in the <em>Mot. An.</em></p>

<p>
So much for the basic idea behind Aristotle&rsquo;s bio-mechanical
conception of the efficient causation of episodes of animal
self-motion by the unmoved soul: the animal soul, when actual in the
perception of objects that are biologically good or bad for the
animal, acts as an unmoved mover because the living body, by its
natural design as teleologically subservient to the soul, reacts to
these perceptions in self-preserving ways with certain thermic
reactions (desire). Desire in turn produces the mechanical force
required to move the animal from one place to the other by means of a
complex chain of inner bodily processes.</p>

<p>
That this is indeed Aristotle&rsquo;s basic answer to the question of
how the soul moves the body is confirmed by the fact that his
bio-mechanical conception of the causation of animal self-motion is in
line with his general scheme of the efficient causation of motion in
the eighth book of his <em>Physics</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For there must be three things&mdash;the moved, the mover, and the
instrument of motion. Now the moved must be in motion, but it need not
move anything else; the instrument of motion must both move something
else and be itself in motion (for it changes together with the moved,
with which it is in contact and continuous, as is clear in the case of
things that move other things locally, in which case the two things
must up to a certain point be in contact); and the mover&mdash;that is
to say, that which causes motion in such a manner that it is not
merely the instrument of motion&mdash;must be unmoved. (<em>Phys.</em>
VIII 5, 256b14&ndash;20, transl. Hardie and Gaye)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to this general account, the causation of any kind of
movement is to be explained in terms of a tripartite scheme consisting
of an unmoved mover, a moved mover and the moved thing. If we apply
the scheme to animal self-motion, the following sequence should
result: the perception of a desired object should act as the
<em>unmoved mover</em>
 (<a href="#stage1"><em>Stage</em> 1 above</a>).
 It should be unmoved because perception involves the activity of the
perceiving soul, and the soul, as emphasized by Aristotle, is
necessarily unmoved (<em>An.</em> I 3, 405b31&ndash;407b11; 4,
408a30&ndash;5). The instrumental body&rsquo;s thermic reaction to the
perception of the object&mdash;desire and the processes that follow
upon desire inside the body&mdash;should be the <em>moved mover</em>,
i.e., the &ldquo;instrument of motion&rdquo;,
 (<a href="#stage2"><em>Stage</em> 2 above</a>),
 and the animal body should be the passively <em>moved</em> thing
 (<a href="#stage3"><em>Stage</em> 3 above</a>).
 And this is in fact how Aristotle applies his general tripartite
scheme in the tenth chapter of the third book of <em>De anima</em> to
the explanation of the efficient cause of animal self-motion. First,
he introduces the unmoved starting point of motion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The first (mover) of them all is the object of desire; for it imparts
motion without being moved, by being apprehended by thought or mental
representation (<em lang="grc">no&ecirc;th&ecirc;nai &ecirc;
phantast&ecirc;nai</em>). However, in number there are several movers.
(<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b11&ndash;13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The perception or, more generally, the cognition of an object of
desire either by perception, mental representation, or thinking, marks
the beginning of the process. Given that cognition involves the
activity of the soul and the soul is necessarily unmoved, Aristotle in
effect is saying that the soul moves the body as an unmoved mover.
Note that, strictly speaking and despite what might appear to some
(for discussion see Richardson 1992: 387ff.), it is not the external
object of desire that moves the animal as the first mover; it rather
is the <em>mental act</em> (the actuality of the soul) of the
awareness of an external object of desire, namely either perception,
thought, or mental representation, provided that they lead to the
animal&rsquo;s desire. Note also that in <em>An.</em> III 10, as well
as in <em>Mot. An.</em> 6, Aristotle uses the term
&ldquo;thought&rdquo; in a wide and inclusive sense, specifically
coined by him for the explanation of animal self-motion, and that
includes perception (see <em>An.</em> III 10, 433a10&ndash;12;
<em>Mot. An.</em> 6, 700b17&ndash;22). In the above quote he says that
&ldquo;in number&rdquo; there are several unmoved movers because not
only thought and <em lang="grc">phantasia</em>, i.e., the mental
representation of objects of desire, but also perception can play the
role of the unmoved mover in animals. For they are all capable of
triggering desires of different kinds. In the immediate sequel
Aristotle applies his tripartite scheme from <em>Physics</em> VIII to
the causation of animal self-motion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since there are three things (in the causation of motion)&mdash;first,
what initiates motion, second, that by which it initiates motion, and
further, third, what is moved&mdash;and (since) that which initiates
motion occurs two times&mdash;in one instance with the unmoved and in
the other with that which initiates motion while being moved, it
follows that the unmoved is the practical good, and that which
initiates motion while being moved is that which is capable of
desiring, for what desires is moved insofar as it is desiring, and
desire, when actual, is a kind of motion; and what is moved, is the
animal. (<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b13&ndash;18, reading, with
F&ouml;rster 1912, <em lang="grc">oregomenon</em> in 433b17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the same tripartite scheme as we have seen it in his general
physics in <em>Physics</em> VIII. The mere fact that he applies his
general tripartite scheme of the causation of movement from
<em>Physics</em> to animal self-motion puts it beyond doubt that
Aristotle considered his explanation of animal self-motion by way of
the soul as the unmoved mover to be scientifically well-founded. In
the end, it is his distinction between the unmoved mover&mdash;the
actuality of the cognitive soul&mdash;and the moved mover&mdash;desire
etc.&mdash;within the animal that allows Aristotle to solve the
problem of self-motion as he described it in <em>Phys.</em> VIII 4,
254b28&ndash;33 (quoted above). Desire as the moved mover plays an
all-important role in the story. The act of perception or cognition
can play the role of the unmoved mover of the body only because living
beings by their natural design as instrumental bodies react to the
objects of their cognition by way of psychophysical (thermal)
movements that result in desire (pursuit or avoidance) in
self-preserving ways. This is why Aristotle says in the <em>De
anima</em> that animals are capable of setting themselves in motion
<em>insofar as they are capable of desiring</em> (<em>An.</em> III 10,
433b17f, 27&ndash;28), calling desire a &ldquo;moved mover&rdquo;
three times (<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b16&ndash;18; <em>Mot. An.</em>
6, 700b35&ndash;701a1, 701a4 sq.).</p>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s answer to the question of how animals set themselves
into motion, then, is this: it is the activity of the perceiving or
otherwise cognizing soul that sets the body in motion. When it does so
it does so in such a way that the animal either pursues or avoids the
objects presented to it by perception or cognition. In the simplest
cases this happens whenever the object, in the biological way
characterized, is either good or bad for the animal. This either
pursuing or avoiding reaction is an internally caused thermal process
(heat, coldness) which in suitable instrumental bodies that are
equipped with the right organs can lead to the dislocation of the
animal as a whole. With this explanation Aristotle can claim to have
mastered the above-mentioned challenge of explaining self-motion as a
setting-the-body-in-motion by its unmoved soul (<em>An.</em> III 10,
433b11&ndash;18; <em>Mot. An.</em> 11, 703b3&ndash;4). He can claim to
have done so on the basis of his novel bio-mechanical and natural
teleological conception of the causation of movement. And this is
precisely what he seems to be doing when he praises himself for having
discovered a way of conceiving of the causation of movement by way of
recognizing something good in his <em>Metaphysics</em>
(<em>Metaph.</em> XII 10, 1075b8&ndash;10; see also <em>Phys.</em>
VIII 5, 256b14&ndash;27).</p>

<p>
So much for the first, still rudimentary and rather abstract
discussion of the question of how the soul sets the body in motion:
the soul imparts motion to the body as an <em>unmoved mover</em> by
providing a starting point of motion, namely the cognition of a
realizable object of desire (i.e., the practical good). This is the
main result of Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion of animal self-motion in
his <em>De anima</em>, namely an account of stage 1 of the process.
What is missing is a treatment of stages 2 and 3. This will follow in
the <em>Mot. An.</em> where Aristotle offers an account of how the
soul moves the body. Note, though, that according to Aristotle&rsquo;s
general account of the causation of motion and change causal
interaction between the soul and the body, as it is said to occur in
the transition from (i) to (ii), i.e., the transition from stage 1 to
stage 2, requires the distinctness of the agent and the patient of the
process: nothing can act on itself insofar as it is one thing. For
<em>X</em> to act on <em>Y</em>, <em>X</em> needs to be distinct from
<em>Y</em> in some way. Hence, if the soul is to impart motion to the
body, there <em>must</em> be a way in which the soul is distinct from
the body. In chapters 8 and 9 of <em>Mot. An.</em> Aristotle will
offer an argument for the thesis that the soul is <em>locally</em>
distinct from the body, even though it is in the body. The question
whether, and if so how, that distinctness of the moving soul from the
body can be squared with his hylomorphism will be discussed later.
These two theoretical tasks, i.e. offering an account of how the soul
imparts motion to the body on the one hand and how the soul is
distinct from the body so as to be able to act on it on the other, are
the main business of the argument of <em>Mot. An.</em> as far as it
regards the common theory of animal self-motion.</p>

<p>
Aristotle offers an extended discussion of the question which part of
the soul is responsible for the causation of animal self-motion in
<em>An.</em> III 9&ndash;10. This is because the <em>De anima</em> is
predominantly concerned with defining the soul as the first principle
for the explanation of the phenomena of living things. This is to say
that in the <em>De anima</em> he is concerned only with stage 1 of the
above three-stage account of animal self-motion. His discussion there
culminates in the forward-looking application of the tripartite scheme
of the causation of motion to animal self-motion just discussed. At
the end of the section in the <em>De anima</em> devoted to animal
self-motion, Aristotle reserves the theoretical treatment of the
bodily side of the process for a separate group of works. Other than
<em>De anima</em>, that treatment is no longer going to deal with the
soul as such but with something else, namely the performances of
animated bodies that they exhibit due to their souls, i.e., the
&ldquo;actions and affections common to body and soul&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote id="quote433">

<p>
The instrument by which desire initiates motion is already something
bodily; accordingly, it is necessary to examine it among the functions
common to body and soul. (<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b19&ndash;21,
transl. Shields)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reference to functions common to body and soul corresponds to the
discussion of animal self-motion in <em>Mot. An.</em>, as scholars
agree (Jaeger 1913; Nussbaum 1978; Kollesch 1985; Rapp &amp; Primavesi
2020; Laks 2020; Polansky 2024). Before we delve into <em>Mot.
An.</em>, however, a brief survey of the methodological underpinnings
of the <em>Mot. An.</em> as part of the group of writings on the
&ldquo;actions and affections common to body and soul&rdquo; will be
useful.</p>

<h2 id="MethUndeMotWorkActiAffeCommBodySoul">2. The methodological underpinning of <em>Mot. An.</em> in the works on &ldquo;actions and affections common to body and soul&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
Even if we did not possess the direct reference to the functions
common to body and soul just quoted, <em>Mot. An.</em> would have to
be grouped together with the writing on the &ldquo;actions and
affections common to body and soul&rdquo;. <em>Mot. An.</em> is
strikingly similar to the larger part of the works collected under the
name of <em>Short Treatises on Natural Philosophy</em> (<em lang="la">Parva
Naturalia</em>, on which see King 2001) in scope and
purpose. On the most likely scenario, then, <em>Mot. An.</em> is part
of the explanatory project of the <em>Parva Naturalia</em> (Jaeger
1913; van der Eijk 1994: 68&ndash;72; Rashed 2004; Morel 2020;
Polansky 2024; Primavesi &amp; Corcilius 2018). Like <em>On Memory and
Recollection</em> (<em lang="la">De memoria</em>), <em>On Sleep and
Wakefulness</em> (<em lang="la">De somno et vigilia</em>), <em>On
Dreams</em> (<em lang="la">De insomniis</em>) or <em>On Youth and Old
Age</em> (<em lang="la">De juventute et senectute</em>), <em>Mot.
An.</em> is concerned with processes that take place in animals,
asking how the phenomenon under discussion comes about. Like the <em lang="la">Parva
naturalia,</em> and unlike <em lang="la">De incessu
animalium</em>, <em>Mot. An.</em> does not speak very much of final
causes (with an exception in the case of the explanation of sleep) but
shows much more interest in the efficient causal explanation of the
processes common to body and soul. Also like the <em>Parva
naturalia</em>, the investigation in <em>Mot. An.</em> seems to be
immediately continuous with the investigation in the <em>De
anima</em>. The first chapter of <em>On Perception and Perceptible
Objects</em> (<em lang="la">De sensu et sensibilibus</em>,
<em>Sens.</em>), which offers an introduction to the <em>Parva
naturalia</em> as a whole, outlines the division of explanatory labor
between the <em>De anima</em> and the <em>Parva naturalia</em> as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since we have drawn our distinctions about the soul by itself, and
about each of its capacities in turn, we must next make our
investigation of animals and of all things that have life, as to which
of their actions are special to some and which are common to all of
them. What has been said about the soul, then, is to be assumed
throughout, but let us speak about what remains, starting with what
comes first. It is evident that the most important [actions and
affections], both those that are common and those that are special to
certain animals, are common to body and soul: perception, memory,
spirit, appetite, and, in general, desire, and in addition to these,
pleasure and pain. For these belong to pretty much all animals.
(<em>Sens.</em> 1, 436a1&ndash;11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Aristotle here announces that he is going to explain the
psycho-physical processes of animals (&ldquo;actions and affections
common to body and soul&rdquo;), and that he is going to do so in a
way that takes its start from the definition of the soul in <em>De
anima</em>. <em>De anima</em> offers a definition of the soul
itself&mdash;of the &ldquo;soul by itself&rdquo;, as the text says
above. The <em>Parva naturalia</em>, for their part, offer
explanations for psycho-physical processes that animals engage in or
undergo by virtue of the fact that they <em>possess</em> a soul (on
the mutual cross-references between the <em>Parva naturalia</em> and
the <em>An.</em> see the list in King 2001: 34 sqq. and 152). Exactly
that same picture applies to the <em>Mot. An.</em> It explicitly
refers back to the investigation of the soul itself in the <em>De
anima</em> (<em>Mot. An.</em> 6, 700b4&ndash;6), while <em>De
anima</em> III 10, 433b19&ndash;21 looks forward to the theory of
animal self-motion as to be treated in the works dedicated to the
functions common to body and soul, as we have just seen above. This
forward-looking reference clearly refers to the account of animal
self-motion in <em>Mot. An.</em> as a treatment of a function
&ldquo;common to body and soul&rdquo;. We may conclude, then, that the
account of animal self-motion in <em>Mot. An.</em> is part of the
<em>Parva naturalia&rsquo;s</em> project of rendering explanatory
accounts of the actions and affections common to body and soul, that
it is immediately continuous with the investigation into the soul
itself in the <em>De anima</em>, and in particular with the
investigation into the psychic principle responsible for animal
self-motion in <em>An.</em> III 9&ndash;11. <em>An.</em> defines the
soul, while <em>Mot. An.</em>, along with the rest of the <em>Parva
naturalia</em>, investigates what animals do or undergo
<em>insofar</em> as they possess a soul, and a perceptual soul in
particular (see <em>Sens.</em> 1, 436b1 sqq.). This impression is
reinforced by the fact that the affections of desire and pleasure pain
take center stage in the account of animal self-motion to come in
<em>Mot. An.</em>, while the beginning of <em>On Perception and
Perceptible Objects</em> just quoted explicitly mentions desire and
pleasure and pain as examples for affections common to body and
soul<em>.</em> Finally, and decisively, the forward-looking passage in
<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b19&ndash;21, quoted above continues with a
short description of what to expect from the treatment of the
functions (or actions and affections) common to body and soul. That
description matches some important contents of <em>Mot. An.</em>
(<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b19&ndash;27, see already Jaeger 1913:
41&ndash;42).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For now, though, to summarize: something initiates motions
instrumentally when the starting point and the end point are the same,
for instance, in a hinge&mdash;since here the convex is the end point
and the concave the starting point (for which reason the one is at
rest and the other is moved), and though different in account they are
inseparable in magnitude. For all things are moved by pushing and
pulling; consequently, it is necessary, just as in the case of a
circle, for something to remain fixed and for the motion to begin from
there. (<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b21&ndash;27, transl. Shields)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes it clear that <em>An.</em> understands the account of
animal self-motion to be given <em>in Mot. An.</em> as an account in
which the soul acts as the <em>unmoved mover</em> of the animal. This
is exactly what we will get in the <em>Mot. An.</em> (see also
<em>Mot. An.</em> 6, 700b4&ndash;6, where Aristotle refers back to
<em>An.</em> when pointing out that the soul is unmoved). Note that
Aristotle here, when he speaks about the problem of self-motion in
analogy to the movement of a door, illustrates the main
<em>explanandum</em> of <em>Mot. An.</em> as a sort of mechanical
problem. The difference is that the movement of the door is
instrumental (<em lang="grc">organik&ocirc;s</em>) because doors are
not self-movers. Doors require an external mover to either open or
close them. This is not so in animal motion which is supposed to be
self-motion. Animal self-motion can in that respect be compared to a
self-opening and -closing door. However, what Aristotle seems to find
particularly important in the analogy is that the movement of the door
is made possible by the fact that there is a hinge or a joint, i.e.,
something that combines movement and rest within the same magnitude.
All movement, he says, happens by way of pushing and pulling, and for
pushing and pulling to occur it requires an unmoved starting point.
This, as we will see, will be important for the account of animal
self-motion, in which the perceptual soul imparts motion to the animal
pretty much like a door hinge. When the animal perceives an object of
desire the actuality of its perceptual soul in presenting the object
of perception will act like a point of support, and in this sense as a
starting point, for the movement of the animal&rsquo;s body. In order
to be able to have this causal effect on the body the perceptual soul
has to be distinct from the body it acts upon but it also ought not to
be different from the body in magnitude, in a way that is analogous to
the concave and the convex parts that constitute the door hinge. And
this is precisely what <em>Mot. An.</em> 8&ndash;9 will argue, namely
that the perceptual soul is located in the heart, while it itself
remains without magnitude. For this makes the soul both, distinct from
the heart and the rest of the body and at the same time not different
from the body in magnitude or extension. There can be little doubt,
then, that <em>Mot. An.</em> is the treatise about the functions
&ldquo;common to body and soul&rdquo; that was announced in
<em>An.</em> II 10. It clearly is a part of the project of the
so-called <em>Parva naturalia</em>.</p>

<h2 id="AccoAnimSelfMotiMot">3. The account of animal self-motion in <em>Mot. An.</em></h2>

<p>
The proper theory of animal self-motion as expounded in <em>Mot.
An.</em> consists of two main parts: an account of how the soul
imparts motion to the body in voluntary self-motion and a proof of the
claim that the perceptual soul is different from the body so as to be
able to act on it and set it into motion, while having a position in
the body. Part one is dealt with in chapters 6&ndash;8, part two in
chapters 8&ndash;9; chapter 10 summarizes the theory in a memorable
analogy that compares the self-moving animal to a political community
with good laws. Chapter 11 ends the treatise with a discussion of the
non-voluntary and involuntary movements of parts of the animal body.
Chapter 11 is a kind of coda or appendix to the main theory. Chapters
1&ndash;5 introduce and discuss two mechanical principles that will
turn out to be important for the second main part of the theory. From
the fact that Aristotle discusses some cosmological implications of
these mechanical principles in these chapters, we can infer that they
must have been important for him, not only for reasons that regard his
theory of animal self-motion but also for reasons outside of his
theory having to do with the general kinematics of his
<em>Physics</em> and even with his theory of the first unmoved mover
from his <em>Metaphysics</em>. There is no space here to discuss these
cosmological digressions. We will discuss the above sections in
turn.</p>

<h3 id="MechUndeAnimSelfMoti">3.1 The mechanical underpinnings of animal self-motion</h3>

<p>
After a short introduction into the subject matter of the treatise,
<em>Mot. An.</em> begins by invoking Aristotle&rsquo;s general schema
for the causation of motion from <em>Physics</em> VIII, according to
which every episode of motion/change structurally requires three
structural elements: an unmoved mover, a moved mover and a moved
thing. Aristotle says that he has shown in his <em>Physics</em> that
every moved thing is moved by a self-mover and that every self-motion
is set into motion by something unmoved. Now, he says, we should see
how this universal account of the causation of motion applies to
episodes of animal self-motion (<em>Mot. An.</em> 1,
698a7&ndash;16):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But we must grasp this not only universally on the basis of the
account, but also as applying to particular cases and to perceptible
things, for the sake of which we also seek the universal accounts and
to which, we believe, these accounts should fit. (698a11&ndash;14, my
translation)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After this remarkable statement Aristotle goes on to introduce his
first mechanical principle of animal self-motion. This is the
<em>internal resting point principle</em>. According to this
principle, every self-motion requires an internal resting point, which
remains unmoved in relation to the motion, and from which the motion
takes its start. Self-motion would not be possible without something
at rest inside the self-moved thing. Aristotle illustrates the
principle with the functioning of a familiar body part, namely the
joints. Joints are natural devices of motion. They make motion
possible because joints can &ldquo;become one and two&rdquo; according
to whether they are bent (two) or extended (one). This is of course
the same mechanical function of &ldquo;instrumentally initiating
motion&rdquo; Aristotle has announced in <em>De anima</em> III 10 by
way of the example of the door hinge (433b21&ndash;27). Just like
door-hinges, joints provide a unitary but internally complex structure
that enables animals to initiate motion. This is because joints can
<em>bend</em>, i.e., they can transition from a state of rest to a
state of movement by folding one of their parts so as to form a
<em>system of motion</em> consisting of an unmoved mover and a moved
part. Aristotle illustrates the workings of joints by way of a
geometrical analogy. Animals, he says, &ldquo;use their joints like
the center of a circle&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig1">
<img src="fig1.svg" style="width:10em" alt="a circle bisected by line D-B and with a line going from the center point, A, to point C on the circle" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Here, point <em>A</em> is a single point on the line
<em>D</em>-<em>B</em> (is &ldquo;one&rdquo;). However, if the line
<em>A</em>-<em>C</em> folds at point <em>A</em> when it bends to
<em>A</em>-<em>C</em>, <em>A</em> becomes &ldquo;two&rdquo;. The
reason is that <em>A</em> is then at the same time both the end point
of line <em>D</em>-<em>A</em> and the starting point of line
<em>A</em>-<em>C</em>. According to Aristotle, joints behave
analogously to point <em>A</em> (living beings &ldquo;use their joints
like the center of a circle&rdquo;, a18). For example, in an
outstretched arm, the elbow joint is &ldquo;one&rdquo; because it is
part of the arm as a whole as it is formed by the upper and the lower
arm. Once the elbow joint bends, however, it becomes &ldquo;two&rdquo;
because it now forms both the end point of the upper arm and the
starting point of the bent forearm. In this way, joints viz. the point
in the joint become &ldquo;both one and two&rdquo; and &ldquo;straight
and bent&rdquo; and &ldquo;beginning and end&rdquo; (<em>Metaph.</em>
IV 6, 1016a9&ndash;16; <em>Phys.</em> VIII 8, 263a23&ndash;25;
<em>An.</em> II 2, 427a9&ndash;14; <em>De Incessu Animalium</em> 9,
708b21&ndash;27). In this sense, joints have the peculiarity of being
able to change into their respective opposites (<em>Mot. An.</em> 1,
698a20; 8, 702a22&ndash;26): When they are stretched, they are one in
actuality, but two in potentiality, because they <em>can</em> bend,
while conversely, when they are bent, they are two in actuality and
one in potentiality (a18&ndash;21). Without some such internal
supporting point animal motion is impossible. (For more on the
functioning of joints see Primavesi &amp; Corcilius 2018: 73&ndash;77
and Rapp 2020: 230&ndash;238, who also discusses the geometrical
example).</p>

<p>
Note, however, that the internal resting point principle, as important
as it is, does not state sufficient conditions for motion. We also
need physical force (&ldquo;pushing and pulling&rdquo; against the
resting point), about which Aristotle will speak later in his account
of how the soul sets the body into motion
 (<a href="#HowSoulSetsBodyMoti">&sect;3.2</a>).
 Also, and importantly, the illustration of the internal supporting
point principle by way of the joints is incomplete. Joints initiate
motion &ldquo;instrumentally&rdquo; which is to say they presuppose a
self-moving animal whose parts they are. Joints are supporting points
only <em>relatively</em> to the motion of parts of animals (<em lang="grc">pros
ho</em>, <em>Mot. An.</em> 1, 698b1). They are not
absolute starting-points of motion because they depend on some other
supporting point which is provided by the animals whose joints they
are. What Aristotle is looking for in <em>Mot. An.</em>, however, is
such an absolute unmoved supporting point of the motion of the animal
as a whole. The example of the joints therefore only provides
inductive evidence for the internal supporting point principle: since
wherever there is movement of the limbs of an animal, the moving limb
must rest on an internal supporting point (or hang from an internal
suspension point), there must be an internal immovable supporting
point also for the movement of the animal as a whole. Such a
supporting point must be unmoved not relatively to the movement of a
part of the animal, but absolutely, i.e., with relation to the animal
as a whole. As we will see below in
 <a href="#MechAnimSelfMotiPercSoulUnmoMoveAnimPosiBody">&sect;3.3</a>,
 <em>Mot. An.</em> 8, 702a21 to 9, 703a3 contains an argument to the
effect that the cognitive soul is that unmoved starting point.</p>

<p>
The second mechanical principle underlying Aristotle&rsquo;s account
of animal self-motion is the <em>external resting point
principle</em>. According to that principle, animal movement is not
possible unless there is an external supporting point or prop for the
animal as a whole that is no part of the moving system. Aristotle
claims the general validity of this principle for all animal movements
on land, water, or air (<em>Mot. An.</em> 2, 698b17&ndash;18). He
illustrates it with the help of two examples in which the principle is
not met (698b15&ndash;18) and with the discussion of what he calls a
&ldquo;problem question&rdquo; (<em lang="grc">aporoumenon</em>,
698b21&ndash;699a11). The first example is wanderers in the sand who
cannot get ahead with their movements because what is supposed to be
the external supporting point of their motions, the sand, gives way.
The second example is mice trapped in pitch. Here, what is supposed to
be the supporting point as it were &ldquo;follows&rdquo; the movement
of limbs. In both cases, there is no suitable external point on which
to support the movement. The ensuing &ldquo;problem question&rdquo; is
meant to give a vivid illustration of the fact that the external
supporting point must really be <em>external</em>, i.e., it must be no
part of the moving object <em>and</em> be completely separate from it.
The problem is this: why can one easily set a boat into motion from
the outside when pushing it with a pole, while one will never be able
to do this from inside of the boat, not even if one possessed
superhuman power like the giant Tityos or the wind god Boreas when he
blows into the sails? The answer is that the prop and mover are not
separate from each other. The external support point principle
requires that the external point of support must be completely outside
the moving system: it must be no part of it; nor can it otherwise be
in it (like sailors in the boat).</p>

<p>
In the ensuing chapters 3 and 4 Aristotle digresses by applying the
external supporting point principle to the motion of the universe as a
whole (see Primavesi &amp; Corcilius 2018, 79-96; cp. Coope 2020;
Morison 2020).</p>

<h3 id="HowSoulSetsBodyMoti">3.2 How the soul sets the body into motion</h3>

<p>
Aristotle starts his account of the common cause of animal self-motion
with a recap of the main results of his account of the psychic
principle responsible for the causation of animal self-motion from
<em>De anima</em> III 9&ndash;11. That is, he identifies the
&ldquo;movers&rdquo; in the animals. These &ldquo;movers&rdquo; are
the psychic or mental states that can play the role of movers in the
causation of animal self-motion. He then identifies the intentional
objects that correspond to these states. Finally, he lines up the
movers and objects he has identified in the causal sequence of his
tripartite scheme from <em>Physics</em> VIII as he has already done in
<em>An.</em> III 10. This, along with a discussion of the goal and
teleological structure of animal self-motion (which is not paralleled
in the <em>De anima</em>) is the main business of <em>Mot. An.</em> 6.
With the first half of chapter 7 the central part of the proper causal
account of episodes of animal self-motion follows. This is the passage
with the so-called &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo;, which contains a
law-like account of the necessary and sufficient causal conditions for
the triggering of episodes of animal self-motion. Finally, there is a
somewhat sketchy account of the unconscious inner bodily chain of
events that lead to the movement of the animal as whole in the second
half of chapter 7 and the first half of chapter 8 (up until
702a21).</p>

<h4 id="LiniUpCausFactAnimSelfMoti">3.2.1 Lining up the causal factors of animal self-motion</h4>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s account of the causation of animal self-motion is
<em>commensurately universal</em> with the phenomenon of animal
self-motion (see introduction), meaning that it applies to all animals
capable of moving themselves, as he himself points out in the
beginning of the treatise in <em>Mot. An.</em> 1, 698a4&ndash;7. This
plays out even in the terminology that Aristotle uses. Already in
<em>An.</em> III 10, 433a9 sqq. he had coined an abstract vocabulary,
specifically designed for the purposes of a common account of animal
self-motion, which he also uses in <em>Mot. An.</em> 6, when starting
with his proper account of how the soul moves the body. Thus, even
though the internal &ldquo;movers&rdquo; of animals are diverse in
different and sometimes even in the same animals, they can be grouped
together in two main classes, which will play equivalent roles in the
accounts of their respective self-motions. Aristotle says that all
cognitive and conative attitudes can be &ldquo;reduced (<em lang="grc">anagesthai</em>)&rdquo;
to &ldquo;thought (<em lang="grc">nous</em>)&rdquo;
and &ldquo;desire (<em lang="grc">orexis</em>)&rdquo;.
In the case of thought this is because
other cognitive attitudes, such as perception or mental representation
(<em>phantasia</em>), can &ldquo;take the same place (<em lang="grc">ch&ocirc;ra</em>)&rdquo;
as thought because they are all
discriminative so as to provide the animal with information relevant
for its self-motion. Nussbaum aptly paraphrases that expression as
saying that they can take the same &ldquo;slots of explanation&rdquo;
(1978: 333). Desire on the other hand comprises all of its three
kinds, namely appetite (<em lang="grc">epithymia</em>), which is the
biologically basic desire for pleasure, spiritedness (<em lang="grc">thymos</em>),
the desire for honor and social recognition,
and wish (<em lang="grc">boul&#275;sis</em>), which is rational
desire. Choice (<em lang="grc">prohairesis</em>) is a mixture of the
two because it involves both desire and cognition. This
&ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; terminology of &ldquo;thought&rdquo; and
&ldquo;desire&rdquo; allows Aristotle to conveniently refer to the
common psychological factors that are operative in all animal
self-motion, without having to take into account the specific features
of different species of animals. <em>Mot. An.</em> is more interested
in the explanatory roles that these factors play in his common theory
of animal self-motion than the specific features of different species
of self-moving animals. Now, on this basis, Aristotle moves on to the
corresponding objects, saying that the <em>object</em> of thought (<em lang="grc">no&ecirc;ton</em>)
and the <em>object</em> of desire (<em lang="grc">orekton</em>)
are the &ldquo;first movers&rdquo;. Here, the
underlying idea is that these objects affect the corresponding psychic
capacities of the animal and therefore come &ldquo;first&rdquo; in the
causal chain of events. As we know from the <em>De anima</em> this
does not mean that the objects of desire and thought &ldquo;out
there&rdquo; are the movers of the animal without further
qualification but that they are so <em>in virtue of being cognized by
the self-moving animal</em> (<em>An.</em> III 10, 433b12). Before he
moves on to insert the moving factors into his threefold causal scheme
from <em>Physics</em> VIII and <em>De anima</em> III 10, Aristotle
adds that not all objects of thought and desire qualify as objects of
animal self-motion. Only such objects of cognition and desire whose
realization lies within the animal&rsquo;s power do. They have to be
&ldquo;achievable by action&rdquo; (<em lang="grc">prakta</em>,
700b25) in the sense that the animal needs to deem their realization
as something it can achieve. This excludes unfulfillable wishes of
human beings but also all other practical goods that animal do not
feel are in their reach. The resulting line-up of the causal factors
of animal self-motion is as follows.</p>

<ul>

<li>Unmoved mover: the object of thought and desire insofar as it is
cognized</li>

<li>Moved mover: desire (as an occurrent event)</li>

<li>Moved thing: the animal</li>
</ul>

<p>
Chapter 6 closes with the remark that &ldquo;For the animal moves and
progresses in virtue of desire or choice, when some alteration has
taken place in respect of perception or <em lang="grc">phantasia</em>&rdquo;.
(701a4&ndash;6) This statement goes
beyond the mere line-up of causal factors we&rsquo;ve learned about
previously in the chapter. Aristotle points forward to the way in
which the above causal structure of unmoved mover, moved mover, and
moved thing is put into action by the <em>perception of an object of
desire</em>. This will be the topic of the next section.</p>

<h4 id="EffiCausAccoEpisAnimSelfMoti">3.2.2 The efficient causal account of episodes of animal self-motion</h4>

<p>
Aristotle explains this first triggering step in the coming about of
episodes of animal self-motion by way of the so-called
&ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; (what follows is the interpretation
expounded and defended in Corcilius 2008a sqq. For a different view
see Nussbaum 1978, Essay 4. Another recent interpretation is offered
in Cooper 2020. See also Morel 2008) Note that the way Aristotle uses
the &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; is not the way the practical
syllogism is understood in the tradition, which typically takes it to
be an illustration of the process of human deliberation (see Cooper
1975, section I). In Aristotle, what is called the &ldquo;practical
syllogism&rdquo; serves to illustrate how the perception of an object
of desire triggers the process of animal self-motion as it is analyzed
in the above threefold schema. The &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo;
(which is an expression Aristotle himself does not use, see Etheridge
1968: 30 and Kenny 1979: 111&ndash;112) is an analogy in which
Aristotle likens the triggering of episodes of animal self-motion by
the perception of an object of desire to the psychological act of
drawing a conclusion from theoretical premises: desire and the
cognition of a desired object are analogous to the thinking of
premises of a theoretical syllogism and the resulting movement is
analogous to the drawing of the conclusion (<em lang="grc">to
symperasma ginetai h&ecirc; praxis</em>, <em>Mot. An.</em> 7,
701a12&ndash;13; 20; 22&ndash;23). The &ldquo;premises&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; are the &ldquo;premise of the
good&rdquo; on the one hand and the &ldquo;premise of the
possible&rdquo; on the other, i.e., a desire for a practical good and
the cognition of such an object of desire here and now and in the
immediate reach of the animal (701a23&ndash;25). Aristotle does not
use the &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; to state <em>reasons</em> an
agent might have for acting thus and so (as he would if the
&ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; served to illustrate human
deliberation) but to illustrate the working of the <em>proximate
efficient cause</em> of the episodes of animal self-motion including
human self-motion (<em lang="grc">eschat&ecirc; aitia</em>, <em>Mot.
An.</em> 7, 701a33&ndash;36). However, given that desire and the
cognition of an object of desire are closely related to the reasons
one might have for acting thus and so, deliberation and the
&ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; are closely related (see below). In
illustrating the proximate moving cause of animal self-motion in the
&ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo;, Aristotle uses the triggering
mechanism of human self-motion (action) as an example for all
self-moving animals, as he usually does in his zoology. This is not
because <em>Mot. An.</em> 7 is &ldquo;anthropological&rdquo; but
simply because human beings are the most articulate kind of blooded
animals and blooded animals in turn are more articulate than other
animals, which however exhibit features that are analogous to blooded
animals. Hence, the human being is in many respects (not in all, see
<em>Hist. An.</em> I 16, 494b19&ndash;24) the richest, clearest, best
known, and thus also the most informative example for features that
hold of all animals (cp. <em>De somn</em>. 2, 455b31&ndash;34;
<em>Hist. An.</em> I 6, 491a19&ndash;26; <em>De Incessu Animalium</em>
5; see Lloyd 1983: 26&ndash;43; Falcon 2024: 12, chapter 3). The point
of the analogy of the &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; is to show how
the process of animal self-motion <em>must</em> come about once the
agent and the patient of the efficient causal relation corresponding
to the first stage of the process come in contact with each other:
whenever an animal or a human agent perceives a suitable object of
desire, that perception will trigger the actuality of the
animal&rsquo;s desire for that object. The desire will in turn trigger
a chain of internal bodily events which&mdash;provided the desire is
strong enough&mdash;will lead to the motion of the animal as a whole.
This is how the &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; in <em>Mot. An.</em>
illustrates the necessary and sufficient conditions for the triggering
of episodes of animal self-motion, which is the first stage of the
threefold scheme of the causation of animal self-motion.</p>

<p>
The chain of internal bodily events triggered by the desire as it
results from the &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; is the subject of
the next section.</p>

<p>
So much for the basic role of the &ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; in
Aristotle&rsquo;s account of animal self-motion. We may say that the
&ldquo;practical syllogism&rdquo; formulates a law-like account of the
triggering of episodes of animal self-motion. According to that
account, whenever an animal that desires some given object, say food,
and it perceives such an object in its immediate environment, then its
perception will activate its desire. With the actuality of desire we
are already in the second stage of the threefold causal structure of
animal self-motion, that of the moved mover. What follows in the
causal sequence, namely the chain of inner bodily events leading to
the movement of the animal, will be a chain of <em>moved movers</em>
as well. But before we come to this next phase in the causation of
episodes of animal self-motion a word on the examples of
&ldquo;practical syllogisms&rdquo; is in place. Most of the examples
Aristotle gives illustrate the triggering mechanism of episodes of
animal self-motion with simple expressions that stand for desire and
cognition (perception): For instance, &ldquo;Every human being should
walk&rdquo; is an expression for a desire, &ldquo;I am a human
being&rdquo; is an expression for a cognition, and &ldquo;straightaway
he walks&rdquo; is that statement of the &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo;
resulting from these &ldquo;premises&rdquo; (<em>Mot. An.</em> 7,
701a13&ndash;14). One example (in 701a17&ndash;22) illustrates how
this mechanism comes about specifically in human self-movers when they
rationally think and deliberate about their actions. But Aristotle is
eager to show that the same basic mechanism triggers the actuality of
desire even in these more complicated cases of deliberate action,
namely the desire for a given object and a cognition of such an object
here and now. The only difference is that in human deliberation the
way the agent comes to cognize the relevant object of desire turns out
to be more demanding, because it involves means-end reasoning and
deliberation.</p>

<h4 id="ChaiInneBodiEvenLeadMoveAnim">3.2.3 The chain of inner bodily events leading to the movement of the animal</h4>

<p>
Next comes Aristotle&rsquo;s description of the second, the
moved-mover stage of the process. Once desire has been triggered by
perception, it will in turn trigger an unconscious but complex chain
of inner bodily events that (in standard cases) lead to the motion of
the animal as a whole. Once again using analogies, this time with
automatic puppets, Aristotle emphasizes that the nature of the process
is that of a <em>natural chain</em> of events that takes place in a
body naturally designed for it. This ensures that the process runs
swiftly. As we have seen, the process starts with the
<em>perception</em> of an object of desire. Aristotle says that
perceptions &ldquo;immediately are present as certain qualities&rdquo;
(701b17&ndash;18) and that these qualities, given that they are either
pleasant or painful for the animal, lead to thermic reactions in the
animal body, namely &ldquo;heatings and chillings&rdquo;. Aristotle,
as we have seen above as well, identifies these endocrine thermic
reactions of the animal body with desire: &ldquo;for what is painful
is an object of avoidance, and what is pleasant is an object of
pursuit&rdquo; (<em>Mot. An.</em> 8, 701b35&ndash;36). The thermic
changes of desire in turn lead to the contraction or the expansion of
the <em lang="grc">connate pneuma</em>, a gaseous body located in the
region of the heart where the perceptual capacity is also located (on
connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em> see below), and which transforms
the qualitative changes of perception and desire into mechanical
force. At this point the causal chain bifurcates. While the impulse of
the connate pneuma provides the animal with the mechanical force to
use its tendons and press upon its joints, the thermic alteration of
desire also alters the consistency of the flesh around the joints so
as to prepare them for motion.
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-de-motu/fig2">Figure 2</a>
 below gives an abstract representation of the chain of inner bodily
events. Aristotle emphasizes that all of this happens quickly, and
indeed almost simultaneously (<em lang="grc">hama te kai tachy</em>,
<em>Mot. An.</em> 8, 702a20), because the members of the causal chain
triggered by the causal mechanism illustrated by the &ldquo;practical
syllogism&rdquo; are by their natures correlative to each other.</p>

<h3 id="MechAnimSelfMotiPercSoulUnmoMoveAnimPosiBody">3.3 Mechanics of animal self-motion. The perceptual soul as the unmoved mover of the animal and its position in the body</h3>

<p>
At this point, Aristotle returns to the mechanics of animal
self-motion that he has touched upon in his discussion of the joints
towards the beginning to the treatise. His argument comes in three
steps. First, he shows that the starting point of animal self-motion
cannot behave like a joint because joints, as we have seen above, are
&ldquo;instrumental movers&rdquo;, i.e., they themselves begin at the
endpoint of some other part of the body (<em>Mot. An.</em> 8,
702a21&ndash;b11). This makes joints only <em>relative</em>
starting-points. The second step consists in an argument for the
thesis that the absolute starting point of animal self-motion, the
&ldquo;moving soul&rdquo; must be located in the middle of the body in
the region of the heart. There must, then, be something in the middle
of the body that is &ldquo;in potentiality one but two in
actuality&rdquo; (<em>Mot. An.</em> 9, 702b26&ndash;27), like a joint,
and that acts as an absolute mover in that it does not have its
starting point at the endpoint of some other part of the body. The
third step of the argument is a proof for the thesis that only an
extensionless supporting point could do the required job to serve as a
prop or a platform for the movements of both halves of the animal body
simultaneously, and that that extensionless supporting point is the
extensionless perceptual soul located (or better
&ldquo;positioned&rdquo;) in the heart (<em>Mot. An.</em> 9,
703a1&ndash;3). The manuscripts contain
 <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>
 which illustrates how point <em>A</em> provides a supporting point
for the movement of <em>C</em> and <em>B</em>. The decisive move in
the proof consists in the claim that the simultaneous movement of the
two halves of the body <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> necessarily requires
a non-bodily supporting point for that movement (for a full
reconstruction of the arguments see Primavesi &amp; Corcilius 2018:
153&ndash;161, and Gregoric 2020).</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig3">
<img src="fig3.svg" alt="two line segments C-A and B-A which meet at point A" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3</span></p>
</div>

<p>
All of this strongly suggests that Aristotle&rsquo;s proof of the
function of the perceptual soul as the mechanical supporting point and
thus the unmoved mover of the animal is his answer to a problem he
identified already in his <em>Physics</em> VIII 4,
254b28&ndash;22:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For what is unclear in this case is not whether they [i.e., the
animals] are moved by something, but rather how we should distinguish
in them between the mover and the moved. For just as in ships and
things not composed by nature, so too in animals the mover and the
moved seem to be distinct, and in this way the entire animal moves
itself. (<em>Phys.</em> VIII 4, 254b28&ndash;33, transl. Reeve; see
255a10&ndash;19 and <em>An.</em> II 1, 413a8&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Aristotle here assigns to the mover of the animal the <em>mechanical
function</em> of being an internal supporting point (or platform) for
its self-motion. As we have just seen, <em>Mot. An</em>. makes the
actual cognition of an object of desire, which is an actuality of the
perceptual soul, the internal unmoved supporting point for its
movement towards the object its desire. In that respect the perceptual
soul works like a leverage point (as Aristotle explicitly says in
<em>Phys.</em> VIII 6, 259b15&ndash;20). This function of an absolute
supporting point was what he hinted at with his description of an
&ldquo;organic&rdquo; mover, i.e., the joints, to illustrate the fact
that the mover of the animal needs to be such as to be one in
extension but two in account in <em>An.</em> III 10, 433b19&ndash;27
 (<a href="#quote433">quoted above in &sect;1.2</a>).
 This is exactly what Aristotle claims for the perceptual soul
<em>qua</em> unmoved mover of the animal in <em>Mot. An.</em> 9,
702b12&ndash;703a3, where he says that the perceptual soul, while
positioned in the center of the body, not being distinct from it in
magnitude, still is distinct from the bodily magnitude in which it
resides.</p>

<p>
Chapter 10 of the treatise discusses the connate <em>pneuma</em>,
which was already mentioned above
 (<a href="#ChaiInneBodiEvenLeadMoveAnim">&sect;3.2.3</a>).
 Aristotle takes it as obvious that animals possess connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em>.
The connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em> is the
part of the body through the agency of which the (stationary) chain of
qualitative events inside the animal is transformed into mechanical
force (<em lang="grc">ischys</em>). Due to its natural character to
convert qualitative (thermic) changes into changes of volume
(extension and contraction), connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em> is
naturally suitable for functioning as the bodily moved mover part of
animal self-motion. This makes the connate pneuma an important
juncture in the process. There is a widespread tradition of
interpreting the connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em> as an Aristotelian
equivalent of Descartes&rsquo; pineal gland, which is to say as a
privileged part of the body that transmits mental happenings like
perception and desire into bodily motion. This interpretation,
however, is manifestly false. First, Aristotle does not hold that the
mental (perception and desire, etc.) has separate existence from the
body. On the contrary, Aristotle thinks of perception as qualitative
and he thinks of qualities as straightforwardly causally efficacious
entities in nature, as we have seen. There simply is no mind-body
problem for Aristotle to solve in the causal history of episodes of
animal self-motion. The analysis of perception is part of his physics.
Also, it is important to note that Aristotle does not causally connect
the connate pneuma to the activity of the soul in an immediate way; he
connects it to the thermic changes that are concomitant with desire.
So, to judge from its place in the causal sequence, connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em>
is not even a candidate for a direct
interaction between soul and body. Aristotle does assign to the
connate <em lang="grc">pneuma</em> the function of being a bodily
moved mover (703a4&ndash;5). That mediating role, however, could be
explained by its function to transform the qualitative changes inside
the body into mechanical force (for doubts and a different suggestion
that connects the connate <em>pneuma</em> closer to the perceptual
soul, see Laks 2020).</p>

<p>
Having completed his account of the efficient causation of episodes of
animal self-motion in the second half of chapter 10, Aristotle now
offers a very interesting comparison of the organic cohesion and unity
of the animal with a city with good laws. Just as a political
community with good laws does not need a ruler (monarch) in each of
its parts to carry out its work in the common interest, so the
self-moving organism does not need a soul in each of its parts to
perform its due function. The role that habit plays in a good
community, where each citizen is supposed to fulfil his particular
duty out of habit, is played in the organism by the particular nature
of each part of the body.</p>

  <td>Parts of the body</td> </tr>

  <td>Do their job by nature</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
The point of the analogy is to show how each of the functionally
diverse parts of highly complex teleological systems such as the
self-moving animal body can still contribute to a single common
function without requiring the presence of the ruling soul at every
juncture of the process. In a well governed city, once the political
order is established, each political official contributes towards the
common good by doing the assigned job well, without requiring the
presence of the king who tells them what they should do in each case.
This is because the political officials do their job out of habit. In
the animal body that role is taken by the nature of each part. The
soul, then, only needs to be present in one particular part of the
body, while the rest of the body is alive by virtue of being
&ldquo;naturally attached&rdquo; (<em lang="grc">prospephykenai</em>)
to the ruling part, which is the heart where the perceptual soul is
located (<em>Mot. An.</em> 10. 703b1). The question of whether
Aristotle&rsquo;s cardiocentrism and the localization of the soul is
compatible with his hylomorphism that has troubled interpreters for
decades therefore turns out to be relatively easy to answer. The fact
that the soul is the form of the living body does not preclude that
the living body as a whole is alive and ensouled due of the fact that
its parts are naturally attached and &ldquo;grown out of&rdquo; the
ruling part of the body where the soul primarily resides, namely in
the heart where the vegetative and perceptual functions primarily take
place (on cardiocentrism and hylomorphism see Corcilius &amp; Gregoric
2013: 88&ndash;89).</p>

<h3 id="CodaNonVoluInvoMoti">3.4 Coda: non-voluntary and involuntary motions</h3>

<p>
The account of voluntary animal self-motion is followed by a treatment
of pseudo self-motions, namely non-voluntary and involuntary
movements. This discussion serves not only to distinguish the
explanandum of Aristotle&rsquo;s theory from apparently similar but
crucially different phenomena, but also to bring out his own view of
what is important about animal self-motion. Aristotle thinks of
voluntary animal self-motion as the motions of the animal as a whole,
while he thinks of non-voluntary and involuntary motions not as
motions of the animal as a whole but of movement of their parts or
subsystems. Movements like those of the digestive system or other
non-conscious processes that take place in the body are non-voluntary.
They involve neither cognition nor desire. Involuntary motions, by
contrast, do involve cognition but not desire. They are motions of
certain (causally relatively autonomous) parts of the body such as the
heart in palpitation or the erection of the male penis. They are
involuntary insofar as they can take place not only in the absence of
a corresponding desire but also in cases when the agent has a desire
that they may not occur. In such cases, the cause of the movements
lies in the cognition of an object in a context in which physical
conditions inside the animal are extremely conducive to the
involuntary motion so that they produce the resulting movement without
corresponding desire (see Primavesi &amp; Corcilius 2018:
171&ndash;177; Morel 2020).</p>

<p>
The treatise ends with a highly informative schematic description of
the animal as a kinematic system. The cross-shaped diagram (see
 <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>)
 has recently been restored from manuscript evidence by Oliver
Primavesi. Letter <em>A</em> represents the cognitive center of the
system, which is also the origin of animal self-motion, i.e., the
perceptual soul. The other letters represent parts in the periphery of
the system: while incoming sensory affections come from the peripheral
sense organs represented by letters <em>D</em> and <em>E</em>, letters
<em>B</em> and <em>C</em> stand for active extremities that are
instrumental for self-motion (legs, wings, fins and the like) and
which are the endpoints of the outgoing motions proceeding from the
cognitive center. But <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> can also stand for any
other active endpoints of outgoing motion such as, e.g., the motion of
the penis or the palpitating motions of the heart.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig4">
<img src="fig4.svg" alt="two line segments that cross at point A. One line segment goes from point E on the upper left to point C on the lower right and other from point D on the lower left to point B on the upper right." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Two scenarios that may occur in this system are distinguished. In one
scenario the motion originates in <em>A</em> and moves in direction of
<em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. This is the good case of voluntary animal
self-motion in which cognition leads to desire which in turn leads to
the self-motion of the animal as a whole. In the other scenario the
motions originate not in the center but in the peripheral sense organs
<em>D</em> and <em>E.</em> In that case they merely <em>pass
through</em> the center in the direction of the active extremities
<em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. In that latter case, the motions have both
their origin and their destination in the extremities, which is to say
that the motions of the parts arrive at each other, with <em>A</em>
functioning as a mere passing station. This double role of <em>A</em>
is possible for Aristotle because the heart is &ldquo;potentially
many&rdquo;, i.e., it can function as the place of origin of motion or
as a mere passing station. The difference between these two scenarios
lies in whether the soul&rsquo;s cognition leads to a desire for the
cognized object in the animal or not. In the former case the resulting
movement will be the movement of the animal as a whole because it
takes its origin in the soul, whereas in the latter case the movement
will not be the animal&rsquo;s motion but the (involuntary) motion of
one of its parts. Here, the origin of the resulting motion, then, will
not be the animal&rsquo;s soul but the peripheral parts of the body
<em>D</em> and <em>E</em>. In that bad case they will run from
<em>D</em> or <em>E</em> to <em>A</em> only &ldquo;as if to an origin
(<em lang="grc">h&ocirc;s ep&rsquo; arch&ecirc;n</em>)&rdquo; and from
<em>A</em> to <em>B</em> or to <em>C</em> only &ldquo;as if from an
origin&rdquo; (<em lang="grc">h&ocirc;s ap&rsquo; arch&ecirc;n</em>,
<em>Mot. An.</em> 11, 703 b 34&ndash;36). This is the subtle
difference between voluntary and involuntary motions: namely whether
or not the cognitive soul acts &ldquo;as an origin&rdquo;. It only
does so when the animal&rsquo;s cognition leads to a desire for the
object of cognition. Neither cognition without a corresponding desire
for the cognized object (as in the case of involuntary motions) nor a
mere &ldquo;passing through&rdquo; the place of the psychic origin in
the heart without perception will do. The soul only becomes a starting
point of self-motion if the animal&rsquo;s desire is triggered by its
cognition in the way described in the &ldquo;practical
syllogism&rdquo; (on the place of chapter 11 in the <em>Mot. An.</em>
see also Morel 2020).</p>

<p>
All in all, and according to his own standards, Aristotle&rsquo;s
theory of animal self-motion is a success. His theory is able to
explain animal self-motion with reference to the perceptual soul as
the unmoved mover of the animal. With this, Aristotle shows himself
able to account for the phenomena of animal self-motion on the basis
of his physics and biology.</p> <!-- bib finished -->
