<h1>Platonism in Metaphysics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 12, 2004; substantive revision Tue Dec 24, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Platonism is the view that there exist such things as abstract
objects&mdash;where (on one standard definition) an abstract object is
an object that&rsquo;s non-spatial, non-temporal, non-physical,
non-mental, and non-causal. Platonism in this sense is a
<em>contemporary</em> view. It is obviously related to the views of
Plato in important ways, but it is not entirely clear that Plato
endorsed this view, as it is defined here. In order to remain neutral
on this question, the term &ldquo;platonism&rdquo; is spelled with a
lower-case &ldquo;p&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../plato/">Plato</a>).
 The most important figure in the development of modern platonism is
Gottlob Frege (1884, 1892, 1893/1903, 1918/19). The view has also been
endorsed by many others, including Kurt G&ouml;del (1947), Bertrand
Russell (1912), and W.V.O. Quine (1948, 1951).</p>

<p>
Section 1 will describe the contemporary platonist view in detail.
Section 2 will describe the alternatives to platonism&mdash;namely,
immanent realism, conceptualism, nominalism, Meinongianism, and
non-factualism. Section 3 will develop and assess the first important
argument in favor of platonism, namely, the One Over Many argument.
Section 4 will develop and assess a second argument for platonism,
namely, the ontological-commitment argument. This argument emerged
much later than the One Over Many argument, but as we will see, it is
widely thought to be more powerful. Finally, section 5 will develop
and assess the most important argument <em>against</em> platonism,
namely, the epistemological argument.</p>

<h2 id="WhatPlat">1. What is Platonism?</h2>

<p>
Platonism is the view that there exist abstract objects, where an
<em>abstract object</em> is an object that&rsquo;s non-spatial (i.e.,
not spatially extended or located), non-temporal, non-physical (i.e.,
not made of physical stuff), non-mental (i.e., not a minds or an idea
in a mind or a disembodied soul, or anything else along these lines),
and non-causal (i.e., causally inert).</p>

<p>
(It&rsquo;s important to note that there is no consensus in the
literature on how exactly &ldquo;abstract object&rdquo; is to be
defined. For instance, some philosophers would want to remove one or
more of the requirements from the above definition; e.g., some people
would remove the requirement for causal inertness. If we do remove
some of the requirements from the above definition, then more kinds of
views will count as platonist views&mdash;e.g., the view that there
are non-physical, non-mental, non-spatiotemporal objects <em>that are
causally
 efficacious</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The question of how exactly &ldquo;abstract object&rdquo; should be
defined won&rsquo;t matter in what follows; but for more on this
issue, see the entry on
 <a href="../abstract-objects/">abstract objects</a>,
 as well as Cowling 2017; Plebani 2020; and Liggins 2024.)</p>

<p>
The above definition of &ldquo;abstract object&rdquo; might be
somewhat perplexing; for with all of these claims about what abstract
objects are <em>not</em>, it might be unclear what they <em>are</em>.
We can clarify things, however, by looking at some examples.</p>

<p>
Consider the sentence &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo;. This sentence seems to
say something about a particular object, namely, the number 3. Just as
the sentence &ldquo;The moon is round&rdquo; says something about the
moon, so too &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; seems to say something about the
number 3. But what <em>is</em> the number 3? There are a few different
views that one might endorse here, but the platonist view is that 3 is
an abstract object. On this view, 3 is a real and objective thing
that, like the moon, exists independently of us and our thinking
(i.e., it is not just an idea in our heads). But according to
platonism, 3 is different from the moon in that it is not a physical
object; it is wholly non-physical, non-mental, and causally inert, and
it does not exist in space or time. One might put this metaphorically
by saying that on the platonist view, numbers exist &ldquo;in platonic
heaven&rdquo;. But we should not infer from this that according to
platonism, numbers exist in a <em>place</em>; they do not, for the
concept of a place is a physical, spatial concept. It is more accurate
to say that on the platonist view, numbers exist (independently of us
and our thoughts) but do not exist in space and time.</p>

<p>
Similarly, many philosophers take a platonistic view of
 <a href="../properties/">properties</a>.
 Consider, for instance, the property of being red. According to the
platonist view of properties, the property of redness exists
independently of any red thing. There are red balls and red houses and
red shirts, and these all exist in the physical world. But platonists
about properties believe that in addition to these things,
redness&mdash;the property itself&mdash;also exists, and according to
platonists, this property is an abstract object. Ordinary red objects
are said to <em>exemplify</em> or <em>instantiate</em> redness.</p>

<p>
Platonists of this sort say the same thing about other properties as
well: in addition to all the beautiful things, there is also beauty;
and in addition to all the tigers, there is also the property of being
a tiger. Indeed, even when there are no instances of a property in
reality, platonists will typically maintain that the property itself
exists. This isn&rsquo;t to say that platonists are committed to the
thesis that there is a property corresponding to every predicate in
the English language. The point is simply that in typical cases, there
will be a property. For instance, according to this sort of platonism,
there exists a property of being a four-hundred-story building, even
though there are no such things as four-hundred-story buildings. This
property exists outside of space and time along with redness. The only
difference is that in our physical world, the one property happens to
be instantiated whereas the other does not.</p>

<p>
In fact, platonists extend the position here even further, for on
their view, properties are just a special case of a much broader
category, namely, the category of <em>universals</em>. It&rsquo;s easy
to see why one might think of a property like redness as a universal.
A red ball that sits in a garage in Buffalo is a particular thing. But
redness is something that is exemplified by many, many objects;
it&rsquo;s something that all red objects share, or have in common.
This is why platonists think of redness as a universal and of specific
red objects&mdash;such as balls in Buffalo, or cars in
Cleveland&mdash;as <em>particulars</em>.</p>

<p>
But according to this sort of platonism, properties are not the only
universals; there are other kinds of universals as well, most notably,
<em>relations</em>. Consider, for instance, the relation <em>to the
north of</em>; this relation is instantiated by many pairs of objects
(or more accurately, by ordered pairs of objects, since order matters
here&mdash;e.g., <em>to the north of</em> is instantiated by &lt;San
Francisco, Los Angeles&gt;, and &lt;Edinburgh, London&gt;, but not by
&lt;Los Angeles, San Francisco&gt;, or &lt;London, Edinburgh&gt;). So
according to platonism, the relation <em>to the north of</em> is a
<em>two-place universal</em>, whereas a property like redness is a
<em>one-place universal</em>. There are also three-place relations
(which are three-place universals), four-place relations, and so on.
An example of a three-place relation is the <em>gave</em> relation,
which admits of a giver, a givee, and a given&mdash;as in &ldquo;Jane
gave Tim a present&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Finally, some philosophers claim that <em>propositions</em> are
abstract objects. One way to think of a proposition is as the meaning
of a sentence. Alternatively, we can say that a proposition is that
which is expressed by a sentence on a particular occasion of use.
Either way, we can say that, e.g., the English sentence &ldquo;Snow is
white&rdquo; and the German sentence &ldquo;Schnee ist weiss&rdquo;
express the same proposition, namely, the proposition that snow is
white.</p>

<p>
There are many different platonistic conceptions of propositions. For
instance, Frege (1892, 1918/19) held that propositions are composed of
<em>senses</em> of words (e.g., on this view, the proposition that
snow is white is composed of the senses of &ldquo;snow&rdquo; and
&ldquo;is white&rdquo;), whereas Russell at one point (1905, 1911)
held that propositions are composed of properties, relations, and
objects (e.g., on this view, the proposition that Mars is red is
composed of <em>Mars</em> (the planet itself) and the <em>property of
redness</em>). Others hold that propositions do not have significant
internal structure. The differences between these views will not
matter for our purposes. For more detail, see the entry on
 <a href="../propositions/">propositions</a>.</p>
 
<p>
(It might seem odd to say that Russellian propositions are abstract
objects. Consider, e.g., the Russellian proposition that Mars is red.
This is an odd sort of <em>hybrid</em> object. It has two components,
namely, Mars (the planet itself) and the property of redness. One of
these components (namely, Mars) is a <em>concrete</em> object (where a
concrete object is just a non-abstract object (so, presumably, a
physical, spatiotemporal object). Thus, even if redness is an abstract
object, it does not seem that the Russellian proposition is completely
abstract. Nonetheless, philosophers typically lump these objects
together with abstract objects. Perhaps it&rsquo;s best to say that
Russellian propositions count as abstract objects on some definitions
but not others. And similar remarks can be made about various other
kinds of objects. Think, for instance, of impure sets&mdash;e.g., the
set containing Mars and Jupiter. This seems to be a hybrid object of
some kind as well, because while it has concrete objects as members,
it&rsquo;s still a <em>set</em>, and on the standard view, sets are
abstract objects. If we wanted to be really precise, it would probably
be best to have another term for such objects&mdash;e.g.,
&ldquo;hybrid object&rdquo;, or &ldquo;impure abstract
object&rdquo;&mdash;but we needn&rsquo;t worry about this issue here.
This essay is almost entirely concerned with what might be called
<em>pure</em> abstract objects&mdash;i.e., abstract objects that are
completely non-spatiotemporal.)</p>

<p>
Numbers, propositions, and universals (i.e., properties and relations)
are not the only things that people have taken to be abstract objects.
As we will see below, people have also endorsed platonistic views in
connection with linguistic objects (most notably, sentences), possible
worlds, logical objects, and fictional characters (e.g., Sherlock
Holmes). And it is important to note here that one can be a platonist
about some of these things without being a platonist about the
others&mdash;e.g., one might be a platonist about numbers and
propositions but not properties or fictional characters.</p>

<p>
Of course, platonism about any of these kinds of objects is
controversial. Many philosophers do not believe in abstract objects at
all. The alternatives to platonism will be discussed in
 <a href="#TaxoPosi">section 2</a>,
 but it is worth noting here that the primary argument that platonists
give for their view is that, according to them, there are good
arguments against all other views. That is, platonists think we have
to believe in abstract objects, because (a) there are good reasons for
thinking that things like numbers and properties exist, and (b) the
only tenable view of these things is that they are abstract objects.
We will consider these arguments in detail below.</p>

<h2 id="TaxoPosi">2. A Taxonomy of Positions</h2>

<p>
There are not very many alternatives to platonism. One can reject the
existence of things like numbers and properties altogether. Or one can
maintain that there do exist such things as numbers and properties,
and instead of saying that they are abstract objects, one can say that
they are mental objects of some sort (usually, the claim is that they
are ideas in our heads) or physical objects of some sort (or that they
exist in physical reality, or some such thing). Thus, the four
mainstream views here are as follows (and keep in mind that
anti-platonists can pursue different strategies with respect to
different kinds of alleged abstract objects, taking one view of, say,
numbers, and another view of properties or propositions).</p>

<h3 id="Plat">2.1 Platonism</h3>

<p>
<em>Platonism</em> is the view described in
 <a href="#WhatPlat">section 1</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="ImmaReal">2.2 Immanent Realism</h3>

<p>
Advocates of <em>Immanent Realism</em> agree with platonists that
there do exist such things as mathematical objects&mdash;or
properties, or whatever category of alleged abstract objects
we&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;and that these things are independent
of us and our thinking; but immanent realists differ from platonists
in holding that these objects exist in the physical world. Depending
on the kind of object under discussion&mdash;i.e., whether we&rsquo;re
talking about mathematical objects or properties or what have
you&mdash;the details of this view will be worked out differently. In
connection with properties, the standard immanent-realist view is that
properties exist in the physical world, in particular, in actual
physical objects; so, e.g., on this view, redness exists in actual red
objects (e.g., in Mars and the Golden Gate Bridge), as nonspatial
parts or aspects of those things (this view traces back to Aristotle;
in contemporary times, it has been defended by Armstrong 1978). There
is certainly some initial plausibility to this idea: if you are
looking at a red ball, and you think that in addition to the ball, its
redness exists, then it seems a bit odd to say (as platonists do) that
its redness exists outside of spacetime. After all, the ball is
sitting right here in spacetime and we can see that it&rsquo;s red; so
it seems initially plausible to think that if the redness exists at
all, then it exists in the ball. As we will see below, however, there
are serious problems with this view.</p>

<p>
Another kind of immanent realism says that properties are
<em>tropes</em>, where a trope is a <em>particular</em>, not a
universal. So, e.g., on this view, one redness-trope exists in Mars
and a <em>different</em> redness-trope exists in the Golden Gate
Bridge, whereas on an Aristotelean version of immanent realism, one
and the same thing (namely, <em>the property of redness</em>) exists
in both Mars and the Golden Gate Bridge&mdash;and, indeed, in all red
things. (Note that while trope theory counts as an immanent-realist
view of <em>properties</em>, it&rsquo;s an <em>anti-realist</em> view
of <em>universals</em>&mdash;because it says that there are no such
things as
 universals.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In connection with numbers, one immanent-realist strategy is to take
numbers to be properties of some sort&mdash;e.g., one might take them
to be properties of piles of physical objects, so that, for instance,
the number 3 would be a property of, e.g., a pile of three
books&mdash;and to take an immanent realist view of properties. (This
sort of view has been defended by Armstrong 1978.) But views of this
kind have not been very influential in the philosophy of mathematics.
A more prominent strategy for taking number talk to be about the
physical world is to take it to be about actual piles of physical
objects, rather than properties of piles. Thus, for instance, one
might maintain that to say that \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not really to say
something about specific entities (numbers); rather, it is to say that
whenever we push a pile of two objects together with a pile of three
objects, we will wind up with a pile of five objects&mdash;or
something along these lines. Thus, on this view, arithmetic is just a
very general natural science. A view of this sort was developed by
Mill (1843) and, more recently, a similar view has been defended by
Philip Kitcher (1984). It should be noted, however, that while there
are certainly physicalist themes running through the views of Mill and
Kitcher, it is not clear that either of them should be interpreted as
an immanent realist. Kitcher is probably best classified as a kind of
anti-realist (I&rsquo;ll say a bit more about this in
 <a href="#MathObje">section 4.1</a>),
 and it&rsquo;s not entirely clear how Mill ought to be classified,
relative to our taxonomy, because it&rsquo;s not clear how he would
answer the question, &ldquo;Are there numbers, and if so, what are
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Finally, Penelope Maddy (1990) has also developed a sort of immanent
realist view of mathematics. Concentrating mainly on set theory, Maddy
maintains that sets of physical objects are located in space and time,
right where their members are located. But Maddian sets cannot be
identified with the physical matter that constitutes their members. On
Maddy&rsquo;s view, corresponding to every physical object, there is a
huge infinity of sets (e.g., the set containing the given object, the
set containing that set, and so on) that are all distinct from one
another but which all share the same matter and the same
spatiotemporal location. Thus, on this view, there is more to a set
than the physical stuff that makes up its members, and so Maddy might
be better interpreted as endorsing a nonstandard version of
platonism.</p>

<h3 id="Conc">2.3 Conceptualism</h3>

<p>
<em>Conceptualism</em> (also called <em>psychologism</em> and
<em>mentalism</em>, depending on the sorts of objects under
discussion) is the view that there do exist numbers&mdash;or
properties, or propositions, or whatever&mdash;but that they do not
exist independently of us; instead, they are mental objects; in
particular, the claim is usually that they are something like ideas in
our heads. As we will see below, this view has serious problems and
not very many people endorse it. Nonetheless, it has had periods of
popularity in the history of philosophy. It is very often thought that
Locke held a conceptualistic view of universals, and prior to the
twentieth century, this was the standard view of concepts and
propositions. In the philosophy of mathematics, psychologistic views
were popular in the late nineteenth century (the most notable
proponent being the early Husserl (1891)) and even in the first part
of the twentieth century with the advent of psychologistic
intuitionism (Brouwer 1913 and 1949, and Heyting 1956). Finally, Noam
Chomsky (1965) has endorsed a mentalistic view of sentences and other
linguistic objects, and he has been followed here by others, most
notably, Fodor (1975, 1987).</p>

<p>
It should also be noted here that one can claim that the existence of
numbers (or propositions or whatever) is <em>dependent on us
humans</em> without endorsing a psychologistic view of the relevant
entities. For one can combine this claim with the idea that the
objects in question are abstract objects. In other words, one might
claim&mdash;and some <em>have</em> claimed&mdash;that numbers (or
propositions or whatever) are mind-dependent abstract objects, i.e.,
objects that exist outside of the mind, and outside of space and time,
but which only came into being because of the activities of human
beings. Liston (2004), Cole (2009), and Bueno (2009) endorse views of
this general kind in connection with mathematical objects; Schiffer
(2003: chapter 2), Soames (2014), and King (2014) endorse views like
this of propositions; and Salmon (1998) and Thomasson (1999) endorse
views like this of fictional objects.</p>

<h3 id="Nomi">2.4 Nominalism</h3>

<p>
<em>Nominalism</em> (also called <em>anti-realism</em>) is the view
that there are no such things as numbers, or universals, or whatever
sort of alleged abstract objects are under discussion. Thus, for
instance, a nominalist about properties would say that while there are
such things as red balls and red houses, there is no such thing as the
property of redness, over and above the red balls and red houses. And
a nominalist about numbers would say that while there are such things
as piles of three stones, and perhaps &ldquo;3-ideas&rdquo; existing
in people&rsquo;s heads, there is no such thing as the number 3. As we
will see below, there are many different versions of each of these
kinds of nominalism, but for now, we don&rsquo;t need anything more
than this general formulation of the view. (Sometimes
&ldquo;nominalism&rdquo; is used to denote the view that there are no
such things as abstract objects; on this usage,
&ldquo;nominalism&rdquo; is synonymous with
&ldquo;anti-platonism&rdquo;, and views like immanent realism count as
versions of nominalism. In contrast, on the usage employed in this
essay, &ldquo;nominalism&rdquo; is essentially synonymous with
&ldquo;anti-realism&rdquo;, and so views like immanent realism will
not count as versions of nominalism here.)</p>

<p>
<em>Prima facie</em>, it might seem that nominalism, or anti-realism,
is further from the platonist view than immanent realism and
conceptualism are for the simple reason that the latter two views
admit that there do exist such things as numbers (or universals, or
whatever). It is important to note, however, that nominalists agree
with platonists on an important point that immanent realists and
conceptualists reject; in particular, nominalists (in agreement with
platonists) endorse the following thesis:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em" id="thesisS">
<dt>(S)</dt>
<dd> If there were such things as numbers (or universals, or whatever
sort of alleged abstract objects we&rsquo;re talking about), then they
would be abstract objects; that is, they would be non-spatiotemporal,
non-physical, and non-mental.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is an extremely important point, because it turns out that there
are some very compelling arguments (which we will discuss) in favor of
 <a href="#thesisS">(S)</a>.
 As a result, there are very few advocates of immanent realism and
conceptualism, especially in connection with mathematical objects and
propositions. There is wide-spread agreement about what numbers and
propositions would be if there were such things (namely, abstract
objects) but very little agreement as to whether there do exist such
things. Thus, today, the controversial question here is a purely
ontological one: Are there any such things as abstract objects (e.g.,
mathematical objects, propositions, and so on)?</p>

<p>
In addition to the four views discussed so far (i.e., platonism,
immanent realism, conceptualism, and nominalism), two other views are
worth mentioning&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="Mein">2.5 Meinongianism</h3>

<p>
According to <em>Meinongianism</em> (see Meinong 1904), every singular
term&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;Obama&rdquo;, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes&rdquo;&mdash;picks out an object that has some
sort of being (that <em>subsists</em>, or that <em>is</em>, in some
sense) but only some of these objects <em>exist</em>. According to
Meinongianism, sentences that platonists take to be about abstract
objects&mdash;sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; and &ldquo;Red
is a color&rdquo;&mdash;express truths about objects that don&rsquo;t
exist.</p>

<p>
Meinongianism has been almost universally rejected by philosophers.
The standard argument against it (see, e.g., Quine 1948: 3 and Lewis
1990) is that it does not provide a view that is clearly distinct from
platonism and merely creates the illusion of a different view by
altering the meaning of the term &ldquo;exist&rdquo;. The idea here is
that on the standard meaning of &ldquo;exist&rdquo;, any object that
has any being at all exists, and so according to standard usage,
Meinongianism entails that numbers and universals exist; but this view
clearly doesn&rsquo;t take such things to exist in spacetime and so,
the argument concludes, Meinongianism entails that numbers and
universals are abstract objects&mdash;just as platonism does.</p>

<p>
It is worth noting, however, that while Meinongianism has mostly been
rejected, it does have some more contemporary advocates, most notably,
Routley (1980), Terence Parsons (1980), and Priest (2003, 2005
[2016]).</p>

<h3 id="NonFact">2.6 Non-Factualism</h3>

<p>
All the views considered so far can be thought of as either platonist
views or anti-platonist views. A final view, <em>Non-Factualism</em>,
is that there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter whether platonism is true
because there&rsquo;s no fact of the matter whether abstract objects
exist. Views of this kind have been endorsed by Balaguer (1998a,
2021), Yablo (2009), and Warren (2016). On
Balaguer&rsquo;s version of the view, &ldquo;abstract objects
exist&rdquo; is <em>catastrophically imprecise</em>&mdash;i.e., so
imprecise that it lacks truth conditions and truth value. Roughly
speaking, the idea here is that </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>it&rsquo;s built into the meaning of &ldquo;abstract objects
exist&rdquo; that some substantive fact is required of reality to make
that sentence true, but </li>

<li>it&rsquo;s catastrophically unclear what this substantive extra
fact could be.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A different sort of non-factualist view, developed by Carnap (1950)
and Maddy (2011), says that </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; and &ldquo;Numbers
exist&rdquo; are trivially true (or analytic) in some languages (which
we can call <em>trivialist languages</em>); and </li>

<li>these sentences are false in other languages (<em>non-trivialist
languages</em>); and </li>

<li>there are no other facts to discover here. </li>
</ol>

<p>
But while this view implies that there&rsquo;s no language-independent
fact of the matter whether &ldquo;Numbers exist&rdquo; is true, it
isn&rsquo;t happily thought of as implying that there&rsquo;s no fact
of the matter whether platonism is true (or whether abstract objects
exist); for on this view, sentences like &ldquo;Numbers exist&rdquo;
are <em>trivially true</em> in trivialist languages&mdash;and so
nothing is required of reality to make these sentences true in those
languages.</p>

<h2 id="OneOverManyArgu">3. The One Over Many Argument</h2>

<p>

 <a href="#OntoCommArguForPlat">Section 4</a>
 will be concerned with what is widely considered to be the best
argument (or kind of argument) for platonism, namely, what we can call
the <em>ontological-commitment argument</em>. But first, in the
present section, we will consider the <em>One Over Many argument</em>,
which goes back to Plato and, prior to the twentieth century, was the
most prominent argument for platonism.</p>

<p>
(There are, of course, many other arguments for platonism in the
literature, aside from these two arguments. For instance, to name just
two recent arguments, De Cruz (2016) argues that realism about numbers
provides the best explanation of the numerical cognition of human
beings and other animals, and Tugby (2022) argues for a platonistic
view of properties by showing how fruitful the view is&mdash;i.e., by
showing how platonism can do theoretical work for us. But this essay
covers just the One Over Many argument and the ontological-commitment
argument.)</p>

<p>
The One Over Many argument can be formulated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I have in front of me three red objects (a ball, a hat, and a rose).
These objects resemble one another. Therefore, they have something in
common. What they have in common is clearly a property, namely,
redness; therefore, redness exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can think of this argument as an inference to the best explanation.
There is a fact that requires explanation, namely, that the three
objects resemble each other. The explanation is that they all possess
a single property, namely, redness. Thus, platonists argue, if there
is no other explanation of this fact (i.e., the fact of resemblance)
that is as good as their explanation (i.e., the one that appeals to
properties), then we are justified in believing in properties.</p>

<p>
Notice that as the argument has been stated here, it is not an
argument for a platonistic view of properties; it is an argument for
the thesis that properties exist, but not for the thesis that
properties are abstract objects. Thus, in order to use this argument
to motivate platonism, one would have to supplement it with some
reason for thinking that the properties in question here could not be
ideas in our heads or immanent properties existing in particular
physical objects. There are a number of arguments that one might use
here, and in
 <a href="#PropRela">section 4.2</a>,
 we will discuss one such argument. But there is no need to pursue
this here, because there is good reason to think that the One Over
Many argument doesn&rsquo;t succeed anyway&mdash;i.e., that it
doesn&rsquo;t provide a good reason for believing in properties of any
sort. In other words, the One Over Many argument fails to refute
nominalism about properties.</p>

<p>
Before proceeding, it is worth pointing out that the One Over Many
argument described above can be simplified. As Michael Devitt (1980)
points out, the appeal to resemblance, or to <em>multiple</em> things
having a given property, is a red herring. On the traditional
formulation, nominalists are challenged to account for the following
fact: the ball is red and the hat is red. But if nominalists can
account for the fact that the ball is red, then presumably, they can
simply repeat the same sort of explanation in connection with the hat,
and they will have accounted for the fact that both things are red.
Thus, the real challenge for the nominalist is to explain simple
predicative facts, e.g., the fact that the ball is red, without
appealing to properties, e.g., redness. More generally, they need to
show how we can account for the truth of sentences of the form
&ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rdquo; without appealing to a property of
 <i>F</i>ness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
(One might also think of the argument as asking not for an explanation
of the fact that, say, Mars is red, but rather for an account of what
it is about the world that <em>makes the sentence &ldquo;Mars is
red&rdquo; true</em>. See Peacock 2009 in this regard.)</p>

<p>
There is a very well-known nominalist response to the One Over Many
argument. The heart of the response is captured by the following
remark from Quine (1948: 10):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That the houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red may be taken
as ultimate and irreducible, and it may be held that&hellip;[the
platonist] is no better off, in point of real explanatory power, for
all the occult entities which he posits under such names as
&ldquo;redness&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two different ideas here. The first is that nominalists can
respond to the One Over Many with an appeal to irreducible facts, or
<em>brute</em> facts. The second is that platonists are no better off
than such brute-fact nominalists in terms of real explanatory power.
Now, Quine didn&rsquo;t say very much about these two ideas, but both
ideas have been developed by Devitt (1980, 2010a), whose exposition we
follow here.</p>

<p>
The challenge to nominalists is to provide an explanation of facts of
a certain kind, namely, predicative facts expressed by sentences of
the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rdquo;, e.g., the fact that a
given ball is red. Now, whenever we are challenged to provide an
explanation of a fact, or alleged fact, we have a number of options.
The most obvious response is simply to provide the requested
explanation. But we can also argue that the alleged fact isn&rsquo;t
really a fact at all. Or, third, we can argue that the fact in
question is a <em>brute</em> fact&mdash;i.e., a fact that does not
have an explanation. Now, in the present case, nominalists cannot
claim that all predicative facts are brute facts, because it is clear
that we <em>can</em> explain at least some facts of this sort. For
instance, it seems that the fact that a given ball is red can be
explained very easily by saying that it is red because it reflects
light in such and such a way, and that it reflects light in this way
because its surface is structured in thus and so a manner. So
nominalists should not claim that all predicative facts are brute
facts. But as Devitt points out, there is a more subtle way to appeal
to bruteness here, and if Quinean nominalists make use of this, they
can block the One Over Many argument.</p>

<p>
The Quine-Devitt response to the One Over Many begins with the claim
that we can account for the fact that the ball is red, without
appealing to the property of redness, by simply using whatever
explanation scientists give of this fact. Now, by itself, this
explanation will not satisfy advocates of the One Over Many argument.
If we explain the fact that the ball is red by pointing out that its
surface is structured in some specific way, then advocates of the One
Over Many argument will say that we have only moved the problem back a
step, because nominalists will now have to account for the fact that
the ball&rsquo;s surface is structured in the given way, and they will
have to do this without appealing to the property of being structured
in the given way. More generally, the point is this: it is of course
true that if nominalists are asked to account for the fact that some
object <i>a</i> is <i>F</i>, without appealing to the property of
<i>F</i>ness, they can do this by pointing out that (i) <i>a</i> is
<i>G</i> and (ii) all <i>F</i>s are <i>G</i>s (this is the sort of
explanation they will get if they borrow their explanations from
scientists); but such explanations only move the problem back a step,
for they leave us with the task of having to explain the fact that
<i>a</i> is <i>G</i>, and if we want to endorse nominalism, we will
have to do this without appealing to the property of <i>G</i>ness.</p>

<p>
This is where the appeal to bruteness comes in. Nominalists can say
that </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>we can keep giving explanations of the above sort (i.e.,
explanations of the sort &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i> because it is
<i>G</i>&rdquo;, or because its parts are <i>G</i>s, <i>H</i>s, and
<i>I</i>s, or whatever) for as long as we can, and </li>

<li>when explanations of this sort cannot be given, no explanation at
all can be given. </li>
</ol>

<p>
The thought here is that at this point, we will have arrived at
fundamental facts that do not admit of explanations&mdash;e.g., facts
about the basic physical natures of elementary particles. When we
arrive at facts like this, we will say: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason
why these particles are this way; they just <em>are</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
This gives us a way of understanding how nominalists can plausibly use
an appeal to bruteness to respond to the One Over Many argument. But
the appeal to bruteness is only half of the Quinean remark quoted
above. What about the other half, i.e., the part about the platonist
being no better off than brute-fact nominalists in terms of real
explanatory power? To appreciate this claim, let us suppose that we
have arrived at a bottom-level fact that Quinean nominalists take to
be a brute fact (e.g., the fact that physical particles of some
particular kind&mdash;say, gluons&mdash;are <i>G</i>). Advocates of
the One Over Many would say that their view is superior to Quinean
nominalism because they can provide an explanation of the fact in
question. Now, when they announce this, people who were interested in
the question of why gluons are <i>G</i>, and who had been disappointed
to hear from scientists and Quineans that this is simply a brute fact,
might get very excited and listen eagerly to what advocates of the One
Over Many have to say. What they say is this:</p>

<p>
Gluons are <i>G</i> because they possess the property of
<i>G</i>ness.</p>

<p>
This doesn&rsquo;t seem very helpful. The claim that gluons possess
<i>G</i>ness seems to do little more than tell us that gluons have
some nature that makes it the case that they are <i>G</i>, and so it
seems that no genuine explanation has been given. After all, those who
had been interested in learning why gluons are <i>G</i> would not be
very satisfied by this so-called &ldquo;explanation&rdquo;. Thus, to
use Quine&rsquo;s words, it seems that advocates of the One Over Many
are &ldquo;no better off, in point of real explanatory power&rdquo;
than brute-fact nominalists are.</p>

<p>
Nominalists might try to push the argument a bit further here,
claiming that the sentence</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em" id="senP">
<dt>[P]</dt>
<dd> Gluons possesses the property of <i>G</i>ness</dd>
</dl>

<p>
is just a <em>paraphrase</em> of the sentence</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em" id="senN">
<dt>[N]</dt>
<dd> Gluons are <i>G</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
On this view,
 <a href="#senP">[P]</a>
 is <em>equivalent</em> to
 <a href="#senN">[N]</a>.
 That is, it says the very same thing. And neither sentence, according
to this view, entails the existence of <i>G</i>ness. We can call this
a <em>paraphrase-nominalist</em> view of sentences like [P]. But
nominalists needn&rsquo;t endorse this view. They can also endorse a
<em>fictionalist</em> view of sentences like [P]. On this view, [P]
and [N] do not, strictly speaking, say the same thing, because [P]
talks about the property of <i>G</i>ness and [N] does not. According
to this fictionalist view, [P] is strictly speaking untrue, because it
talks about the property of <i>G</i>ness, and according to nominalism,
there is no such thing as <i>G</i>ness. In short, [P] is strictly
speaking untrue, on this view, for the same reason that, e.g.,
&ldquo;The tooth fairy is nice&rdquo; is untrue. But while [P] is not
<em>literally</em> true on this view, it is
&ldquo;for-all-practical-purposes true&rdquo;, or some such thing,
because colloquially, it can be used to say what [N] says literally.
This idea is often captured by saying that [P] is just a <em>manner of
speaking</em>, or a <em>fa&ccedil;on de parler</em>. (Notice that the
dispute between fictionalism and paraphrase nominalism is best
understood as a straightforward empirical dispute about the
ordinary-language semantics of sentences like [P]; the question is
whether such utterances literally say the same things that the
corresponding sentences like [N] say.)</p>

<p>
Whichever view nominalists adopt here, they can respond to the One
Over Many argument&mdash;i.e., to the claim that we can explain
 <a href="#senN">[N]</a>
 by endorsing
 <a href="#senP">[P]</a>&mdash;in
 the same way, namely, by pointing out that as an explanation of [N],
[P] is completely uninformative. Even if nominalists endorse a
fictionalist view according to which [P] is not equivalent to [N],
they can still say that the above explanation is uninformative,
because it really just says that gluons are <i>G</i> because they
possess a nature that makes it the case that they are <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>
Having made the point that the platonist explanation of
 <a href="#senN">[N]</a>
 is uninformative, the nominalist&rsquo;s next move is to appeal to
Ockham&rsquo;s razor to argue that we <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> believe
in <i>G</i>ness (or at least that we shouldn&rsquo;t believe in
<i>G</i>ness for any reason that has anything to do with the need to
explain things like [N]). Ockham&rsquo;s razor is a principle that
tells us that we should believe in objects of a given kind only if
they play a genuine explanatory role. This principle suggests that if
<i>G</i>ness does not play a genuine role in an explanation of the
fact that gluons are <i>G</i>, then we shouldn&rsquo;t believe in
<i>G</i>ness&mdash;or, again, we shouldn&rsquo;t believe in it for any
reason having to do with the need to explain the fact that gluons are
<i>G</i>.</p>

<p>
The Quinean response to the One Over Many argument is often couched in
terms of a <em>criterion of ontological commitment</em>. A criterion
of ontological commitment is a principle that tells us when we are
committed to believing in objects of a certain kind in virtue of
having assented to certain sentences. What the above response to the
One Over Many suggests is that we are ontologically committed not by
predicates like &ldquo;is red&rdquo; and &ldquo;is a rock&rdquo;, but
by <em>singular terms</em>. (A singular term is just a denoting
phrase, i.e., an expression that purports to refer to a specific
object, e.g., proper names like &ldquo;Mars&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Obama&rdquo;, certain uses of pronouns like &ldquo;she&rdquo;,
and on some views, definite descriptions like &ldquo;the oldest U.S.
senator&rdquo;.) More specifically, the idea here seems to be this: if
you think that a sentence of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is
<i>F</i>&rdquo; is true, then you have to accept the existence of the
object <i>a</i>, but you do not have to accept the existence of a
property of <i>F</i>ness; for instance, if you think that &ldquo;The
ball is red&rdquo; is true, then you have to believe in the ball, but
you do not have to believe in redness; or if you think that
&ldquo;Fido is a dog&rdquo; is true, then you have to believe in Fido
but not in the property of doghood.</p>

<p>
Three points need to be made here. First, the above criterion needs to
be generalized so that it covers the use of singular terms in other
kinds of sentences, e.g., sentences of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is
<i>R</i>-related to <i>b</i>&rdquo;. Second, on the standard view, we
are ontologically committed not just by singular terms but also by
existential statements&mdash;e.g., by sentences like &ldquo;There are
some <i>F</i>s&rdquo;, &ldquo;There is at least one <i>F</i>&rdquo;,
and so on (in first-order logic, such sentences are symbolized as
<span class="nobr">&ldquo;\(\exists xFx\)&rdquo;,</span> and the
<span class="nobr">&ldquo;\(\exists\)&rdquo;</span> is called an
<em>existential quantifier</em>). The standard view here is that if
you think that a sentence like this is true, then you are committed to
believing in the existence of some <i>F</i>s (or at least one
<i>F</i>) but you do not have to believe in <i>F</i>ness; for
instance, if we assent to &ldquo;There are some dogs&rdquo;, then we
are committed to believing in the existence of some dogs, but we are
not thereby committed to believing in the existence of the property of
doghood. (Quine actually thought that we are committed <em>only</em>
by existential claims and not by singular terms; but this is not a
widely held view.) Third and finally, it is usually held that we are
ontologically committed by singular terms and existential expressions
(or existential quantifiers) only when they appear in sentences that
we think are <em>literally</em> true and only when we think the
singular term or existential quantifier in question <em>can&rsquo;t be
paraphrased away</em>. We can see what&rsquo;s meant by this by
returning to the sentence</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em" id="senR">
<dt>[R]</dt>
<dd> The ball possesses the property of redness.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In this sentence, the expression &ldquo;the property of redness&rdquo;
seems to be a singular term&mdash;it seems to <em>denote</em> the
property of redness; thus, using the above criterion of ontological
commitment, if we think
 <a href="#senR">[R]</a>
 is true, then it would seem, we are committed to believing in the
property of redness. But there are two different responses that
nominalists can make to this. First, they can endorse paraphrase
nominalism (defined a few paragraphs back) with respect to [R]. If
they do this, they will claim that [R] doesn&rsquo;t really carry an
ontological commitment to the property of redness, because it is
really just equivalent to the sentence &ldquo;The ball is red&rdquo;.
This idea is often expressed by saying that in [R], the singular term
&ldquo;the property of redness&rdquo; can be <em>paraphrased
away</em>&mdash;which is just to say that [R] can be paraphrased by
(or is equivalent to) a sentence that doesn&rsquo;t contain the
singular term &ldquo;the property of redness&rdquo; (namely,
&ldquo;The ball is red&rdquo;). The second view that nominalists can
endorse with respect to [R] is fictionalism. In other words, they can
admit that [R] does commit to the existence of the property of
redness, but they can maintain that because of this (and because there
are no such things as properties), [R] is, strictly speaking, untrue,
even if it is &ldquo;for-all-practical-purposes true&rdquo;, or some
such thing.</p>

<p>
Having said all of this, we can summarize by saying that the standard
view of ontological commitment is as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>The Standard Criterion of Ontological Commitment</em>: We are
ontologically committed by the singular terms (that can&rsquo;t be
paraphrased away) in the (simple) sentences that we take to be
literally true; and we are ontologically committed by the existential
quantifiers (that can&rsquo;t be paraphrased away) in the
(existential) sentences that we take to be literally true; but we are
not committed by the predicates in such sentences. Thus, for instance,
if we believe that a sentence of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is
<i>F</i>&rdquo; is literally true, and if we think that it cannot be
paraphrased into some other sentence that avoids reference to
<i>a</i>, then we are committed to believing in the object <i>a</i>
but not the property of <i>F</i>ness; and, likewise, if we assent to a
sentence of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>R</i>-related to
<i>b</i>&rdquo;, then we are committed to believing in the objects
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> but not the relation <i>R</i>; and if we assent
to a sentence of the form &ldquo;There is an <i>F</i>&rdquo; then we
are committed to believing in an object that is <i>F</i> but we are
not committed to the property of
 <i>F</i>ness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 </div>

<p>
The One Over Many argument is now widely considered to be a bad
argument. Ironically, though, the standard criterion of ontological
commitment&mdash;which Quinean nominalists appeal to in responding to
the One Over Many argument&mdash;is one of the central premises in
what is now thought to be the best argument (or the best <em>kind</em>
of argument) for platonism. We can call arguments of this kind
<em>ontological-commitment arguments</em>.</p>

<h2 id="OntoCommArguForPlat">4. Ontological-Commitment Arguments for Platonism</h2>

<p>
Very roughly, an ontological-commitment argument for platonism is an
argument that proceeds by locating an ordinary sentence <i>S</i> and
claiming that </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> <i>S</i> is true, and </li>

<li> <i>S</i> has a logical form that makes it the case that it has an
ontological commitment to certain objects&mdash;or certain kinds of
objects&mdash;that could only be abstract objects.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The three most important logical forms here&mdash;i.e., the three
logical forms that feature most often in these arguments&mdash;are
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li> &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rdquo; (as in, e.g., &ldquo;3 is
prime&rdquo;), and </li>

<li> &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>R</i>-related to <i>b</i>&rdquo; (as in,
e.g., &ldquo;4 is greater than 3&rdquo;), and </li>

<li> &ldquo;There are some <i>F</i>s&rdquo; (as in, e.g., &ldquo;There
are some prime numbers between 10 and 20&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Ontological-commitment arguments for platonism are arguably already
present in the works of Plato, but the first really clear formulation
of an ontological-commitment argument was given by Frege (see, e.g.,
his 1884, 1892, 1893/1903, 1918/19).</p>

<p>
We will begin, in
 <a href="#MathObje">section 4.1</a>,
 by constructing an ontological-commitment argument for the existence
of <em>numbers</em>. After that, we will discuss
ontological-commitment arguments for the existence of propositions,
properties, relations, sentence types, possible worlds, logical
objects, and fictional objects.</p>

<h3 id="MathObje">4.1 Mathematical Objects</h3>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s an ontological-commitment argument for a platonistic view
of numbers:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ontargs">
<dt id="ontarg1">[1]</dt>
<dd> The sentence &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; is true.</dd>
<dt id="ontarg2">[2]</dt>
<dd> The sentence &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; should be read at face
value; that is, it should be read as being of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i>
is <i>F</i>&rdquo; and, hence, as making straightforward claims about
the nature of a certain object&mdash;namely, the number 3. But</dd>
<dt id="ontarg3">[3]</dt>
<dd> If [1] and [2] are both true, then the number 3 exists. (This
follows from the standard criterion of ontological commitment that was
articulated in
 <a href="#OneOverManyArgu">section 3</a>.)
 Therefore,</dd>
<dt id="ontarg4">[4]</dt>
<dd> The number 3 exists. But</dd>
<dt id="ontarg5">[5]</dt>
<dd> If the number 3 exists, then all of the natural numbers exist.
And</dd>
<dt id="ontarg6">[6]</dt>
<dd> If the natural numbers exist, then they&rsquo;re either abstract
objects, or physical objects, or mental objects. But</dd>
<dt id="ontarg7">[7]</dt>
<dd> The natural numbers aren&rsquo;t physical objects. And</dd>
<dt id="ontarg8">[8]</dt>
<dd> The natural numbers aren&rsquo;t mental objects. Therefore, from
[4]&ndash;[8], it follows that</dd>
<dt id="ontarg9">[9]</dt>
<dd> The natural numbers exist, and they are abstract objects.
But</dd>
<dt id="ontarg10">[10]</dt>
<dd> If [9] is true, then platonism is true. Therefore,</dd>
<dt id="ontarg11">[11]</dt>
<dd> Platonism is true.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
The first clear statement of an argument of this general kind was
given by Frege (1884); other advocates include Quine (see his 1948 and
1951, though he doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state the argument there),
G&ouml;del (1947), C. Parsons (1965, 1971, 1994), Putnam (1972),
Steiner (1975), Resnik (1981, 1997), Zalta (1983, 1999), Wright
(1983), Burgess (1983), Hale (1987), Shapiro (1989, 1997), the early
Maddy
 (1990),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Katz (1998), Colyvan (2001), McEvoy (2005, 2012), and Marcus
(2015).</p>

<p>
This version of the argument is formulated much more
carefully&mdash;using more premises&mdash;than is usual in the
literature. The reason for this is to isolate all of the separate
claims that the argument rests on, and to lay bare the reasoning
behind the argument. The argument is clearly valid, and so the only
question is whether the basic premises (i.e.,
 <a href="#ontarg1">[1]&ndash;[3]</a>,
 <a href="#ontarg5">[5]&ndash;[8]</a>, and
 <a href="#ontarg10">[10]</a>)
 are true. But
 <a href="#ontarg5">[5]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ontarg6">[6]</a>
 are both trivially true, and I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who would
deny either of them, so we can assume that they&rsquo;re
 true.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 So that leaves six basic premises, namely,
 <a href="#ontarg1">[1]&ndash;[3]</a>,
 <a href="#ontarg7">[7]&ndash;[8]</a>, and
 <a href="#ontarg10">[10]</a>.
 But, <em>prima facie</em>, all six of those premises seem extremely
plausible, if not downright obvious, and so the argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>
 has considerable force.</p>

<p>
The nice thing about the way this argument is formulated is that there
are six main varieties of anti-platonism in the literature, and each
of these six views involves a rejection of a different premise in the
argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>.
 In the remainder of this section, I&rsquo;ll discuss these six
different responses to the argument.</p>

<h4 id="PsycRejePrem8">4.1.1 Psychologism and the Rejection of Premise [8]</h4>

<p>
Advocates of psychologism reject premise
 <a href="#ontarg8">[8]</a>
 and claim that the natural numbers are mental objects&mdash;and, more
generally, that our mathematical theories are theories of mental
objects.</p>

<p>
Frege (1884: introduction and &sect;27; 1893/1903: introduction; 1894;
and 1918/19) gave several compelling arguments against psychologism.
First, it seems that psychologism is incapable of accounting for the
truth of sentences that are about <em>all</em> natural numbers,
because there are infinitely many natural numbers and clearly, there
could not be infinitely many number-ideas in human minds. Second,
psychologism seems to entail that sentences about very large numbers
(in particular, numbers that no one has ever had a thought about) are
not true; for if none of us has ever had a thought about some very
large number, then psychologism entails that there is no such number
and, hence, that no sentence about that number could be true. Third,
psychologism turns mathematics into a branch of psychology, and it
makes mathematical truths contingent upon psychological truths, so
that, for instance, if we all died, &ldquo;4 is greater than 2&rdquo;
would suddenly become untrue. But this seems wrong: it seems that
mathematics is true independently of us; that is, it seems that the
question of whether 4 is greater than 2 has nothing at all to do with
the question of how many humans are alive. Fourth and finally,
psychologism suggests that the proper methodology for mathematics is
that of empirical psychology; that is, it seems that if psychologism
were true, then the proper way to discover whether, say, there is a
prime number between 10,000,000 and 10,000,020, would be to do an
empirical study of humans and ascertain whether there is, in fact, an
idea of such a number in one of our heads; but of course, this is not
the proper methodology for mathematics. As Frege says (1884:
&sect;27), &ldquo;Weird and wonderful&hellip;are the results of taking
seriously the suggestion that number is an idea&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Platonists do not deny that we have ideas of mathematical objects.
What they deny is that our mathematical sentences are <em>about</em>
these ideas. Thus, the dispute between platonism and psychologism is
at least partly a <em>semantic</em> one. Advocates of psychologism
agree with platonists that in the sentence &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo;,
&ldquo;3&rdquo; functions as a singular term (i.e., as a denoting
expression). But they disagree about the referent of this expression.
They think that &ldquo;3&rdquo; refers to a mental object, in
particular, an idea in our heads. It is this <em>semantic</em> thesis
that platonists reject and that the above Fregean arguments are
supposed to refute. More specifically, they&rsquo;re supposed to show
that the psychologistic semantics of mathematical discourse is not
correct because it has consequences that fly in the face of the actual
usage of mathematical language.</p>

<p>
Once we appreciate the fact that psychologism involves a semantic
thesis, the view starts to seem implausible in the extreme. To
appreciate this, imagine someone rejecting Euclid&rsquo;s theorem that
there are infinitely many prime numbers on the grounds that there are
only finitely many human ideas in the universe, and so there
couldn&rsquo;t be infinitely many numbers, let alone prime numbers.
Anyone who objected in this way could be accused of not understanding
what &ldquo;There are infinitely many prime numbers&rdquo;
<em>means</em> in our language. In our language, this sentence is
simply <em>not</em> a claim about things that exist in our heads. And
so psychologism is just false&mdash;it involves an empirically false
theory of what mathematical sentences actually mean in ordinary
English.</p>

<p>
You might think that the above arguments target an implausible version
of psychologism; more specifically, you might think that advocates of
psychologism could say not that our mathematical theories are about
<em>actual</em> mental things that really exist in really human heads,
but rather that our mathematical theories are claims about what sorts
of ideas it would be <em>possible to construct</em> in our heads. But
now we have to ask what a <em>possible idea</em> is. Assuming that we
don&rsquo;t endorse a Lewisian (1986) modal realism according to which
every possible idea really exists in a real human head in some real
possible world, then it would seem that either </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>possible ideas are abstract objects of some kind (thus, making
this possible-idea view a version of platonism, rather than
psychologism), or </li>

<li>there are really no such things as possible ideas (thus, making
this view a version of nominalism&mdash;in particular, this view would
involve a rejection of premise
 <a href="#ontarg2">[2]</a>,
 rather than premise
 <a href="#ontarg8">[8]</a>).</li>
 </ol>

<h4 id="PhysRealRejePrem7">4.1.2 Physicalism/Immanent Realism and the Rejection of Premise [7]</h4>

<p>
A similar argument can be run against the view that numbers are
physical object and, hence, that premise
 <a href="#ontarg7">[7]</a>
 is false. Imagine someone rejecting Euclid&rsquo;s theorem that there
are infinitely many prime numbers on the grounds that there are only
finitely many physical objects in the universe, and so there
couldn&rsquo;t be infinitely many numbers, let alone prime numbers.
Regardless of whether this person is correct in their claim that there
are only finitely many physical objects in the universe, they are
deeply confused about what the sentence &ldquo;There are infinitely
many prime numbers&rdquo; means in our language. In ordinary English,
the truth of &ldquo;There are infinitely many prime numbers&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t depend on the claim that there are infinitely many
physical objects because, in our language, that sentence isn&rsquo;t
<em>about</em> physical objects. And so, like psychologism, this
physicalistic view of mathematics is clearly false&mdash;because it
involves an obviously false empirical theory of what mathematical
sentences like &ldquo;There are infinitely many prime numbers&rdquo;
mean in ordinary English.</p>

<p>
Now, once again, you might think that this argument targets the wrong
kind of physicalistic view. Consider, e.g., Mill&rsquo;s (1843: book
II, chapters 5 and 6) view that sentences about numbers are really
just general claims about bunches of ordinary objects. More
specifically, on this view, the sentence &ldquo;2 + 1 = 3&rdquo;, for
instance, isn&rsquo;t really about specific objects (the numbers 1, 2,
and 3). Rather, it says that whenever we add one object to a pile of
two objects, we will get a pile of three objects. You might complain
that the argument of the preceding paragraph doesn&rsquo;t undermine
Mill&rsquo;s version of physicalism because Mill&rsquo;s view
doesn&rsquo;t entail that there are infinitely many physical
objects.</p>

<p>
But while Mill&rsquo;s view clearly has physicalistic leanings, it
doesn&rsquo;t really involve a rejection of premise
 <a href="#ontarg7">[7]</a>.
 It is better thought of as involving a rejection of premise
 <a href="#ontarg2">[2]</a>&mdash;because
 it rejects the face-value reading of sentences like &ldquo;2 + 1 =
3&rdquo;. But as we&rsquo;ll see in
 <a href="#ParaNomiRejePrem2">section 4.1.4</a>,
 if anti-platonists are going to reject premise [2], there are better
ways to do it. One problem with Mill&rsquo;s view is that it is not
easily generalizable to other branches of mathematics. For instance,
it&rsquo;s hard to see how Mill&rsquo;s view could be extended to set
theory. Now, it might seem that we could do this by taking set theory
to be about bunches of ordinary objects, or piles of physical stuff.
This, however, is untenable. For the principles of set theory entail
that corresponding to every physical object, there is a huge infinity
of sets. Corresponding to the ball on my table, for instance, there is
the set containing the ball, the set containing that set, the set
containing <em>that</em> set, and so on; and there is the set
containing the ball and the set containing the set containing the
ball; and so on and on and on. Clearly, these sets are not just piles
of physical stuff, because (a) there are infinitely many of them
(again, this follows from the principles of set theory) and (b) all of
these infinitely many sets share the same physical base. Thus, it
seems that claims about sets are not claims about bunches of ordinary
objects, or even generalized claims about such bunches. They are
claims about <em>sets</em>, which are objects of a different kind.</p>

<p>
Another problem with physicalistic views along the lines of
Mill&rsquo;s is that they seem incapable of accounting for the sheer
size of the infinities involved in set theory. Standard set theory
entails not just that there are infinitely large sets, but that there
are infinitely many sizes of infinity, which get larger and larger
with no end, and that there actually exist sets of all of these
different sizes of infinity. There is simply no plausible way to take
this theory to be about physical stuff.</p>

<p>
These arguments do not refute the kind of immanent realism defended by
the early Maddy (1990). On Maddy&rsquo;s view, sets of physical
objects are located in spacetime, right where their members are. Thus,
if you have two eggs in your hand, then you also have the set
containing those eggs in your hand. Maddy&rsquo;s view has no problem
accounting for the massive infinities in mathematics, for on her view,
corresponding to every physical object, there is a huge infinity of
sets that exist in space and time, right where the given physical
object exists. Given this, it should be clear that while Maddy&rsquo;s
view says that sets exist in spacetime, it cannot be thought of as
saying that sets are physical objects. So Maddy&rsquo;s view is not a
physicalist view in the sense that&rsquo;s relevant here (as was
pointed out above, it is better thought of as a non-standard version
of platonism). Thus, in the present context (i.e., the context in
which platonists are trying to undermine views that take mathematical
objects to be physical objects), platonists do not need to argue
against Maddy&rsquo;s view. Of course, in the end, if they want to
motivate the standard version of platonism, then they&rsquo;ll have to
give reasons for preferring their view to Maddy&rsquo;s non-standard
version of platonism, and this might prove hard to do. For some
arguments against Maddy&rsquo;s early view, see, e.g., Lavine (1992),
Dieterle and Shapiro (1993), Milne (1994), Riskin (1994), Carson
(1996), and the later Maddy (1997).</p>

<p>
(Similar remarks can be made in connection with other immanent realist
views, e.g., Armstrong&rsquo;s (1978) view, but we won&rsquo;t pursue
this here.)</p>

<p>
If the arguments of this subsection and the preceding one are cogent,
then sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; are not about physical or
mental objects, and so numbers aren&rsquo;t physical or mental
objects, and premises
 <a href="#ontarg7">[7]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ontarg8">[8]</a>
 are true. But if this is right, then if we want to resist platonism,
we&rsquo;re going to have to defend a nominalistic philosophy of
mathematics. There are four different nominalistic views that we need
to consider; these four views correspond to the rejection of premises
 <a href="#ontarg1">[1]&ndash;[3]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ontarg10">[10]</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="FictTheoRejePrem1">4.1.3 Fictionalism/Error Theory and the Rejection of Premise [1]</h4>

<p>
One way for nominalists to respond to the argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>
 is to reject premise
 <a href="#ontarg1">[1]</a>
 and endorse an <em>error theory</em>&mdash;or, as it&rsquo;s also
often called, a <em>fictionalist view</em>&mdash;of mathematical
discourse. We can define this view as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Mathematical Error Theory</em> (aka, <em>Mathematical
Fictionalism</em>): </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>The platonist&rsquo;s face-value semantics of mathematical
discourse is correct (i.e., sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; do
<em>purport</em> to be about abstract objects); but </li>

<li> there are no such things as abstract objects; and so </li>

<li> these sentences (and, indeed, our mathematical theories) are not
true.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Thus, on this view, just as <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> is not true
because there are no such things as talking rabbits, hookah-smoking
caterpillars, and so on, so too our mathematical theories are not true
because there are no such things as numbers and sets and so
 on.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 (Fictionalist views have been developed by numerous philosophers, as
we will see in discussing the objections to fictionalism and the
responses to those objections that fictionalists have mounted.)</p>

<p>
There are a few different ways that platonists might try to argue
against fictionalism. The most famous and widely discussed argument
against fictionalism is the <em>Quine-Putnam indispensability
argument</em> (see Quine 1948, 1951; Putnam 1972, 2012; and Colyvan
2001). This argument (or at any rate, one version of it) proceeds as
follows: it cannot be that mathematics is untrue, as fictionalists
suggest, because </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> mathematics is an indispensable part of our physical theories
(e.g., quantum mechanics, general relativity theory, evolutionary
theory, and so on) and so </li>

<li> if we want to maintain that our physical theories are true (and
surely we do&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want our disbelief in abstract
objects to force us to be anti-realists about natural science), then
we have to maintain that our mathematical theories are true.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fictionalists have developed two different responses to the
Quine-Putnam argument. <em>The hard-road response</em>, developed by
Field (1980, 1989) and Balaguer (1998a), is based on the claim that
mathematics is, in fact, not indispensable to empirical
science&mdash;i.e., that our empirical theories can be
<em>nominalized</em>, or reformulated in a way that avoids reference
to abstract objects. The <em>easy-road</em> response, developed by
Balaguer (1998a), Rosen (2001), Yablo (2001, 2002, 2005), Bueno
(2009), Leng (2005a, 2010), and perhaps Melia (2000), is to grant the
indispensability of mathematics to empirical science and to simply
account for the relevant applications from a fictionalist point of
view. (A counterresponse to the easy-road response has been given by
Colyvan (2002), Baker (2005, 2009), and Baron (2020), who argue that
fictionalists can&rsquo;t account for the <em>explanatory</em> role
that mathematics plays in science; responses to the explanatory
version of the indispensability argument have been given by Melia
(2002), Leng (2005b), Bangu (2008), Daly and Langford (2009),
Mart&iacute;nez-Vidal and Rivas-de-Castro (2020), and Boyce
(2021).)</p>

<p>
A second objection that one might raise against fictionalism is that
it&rsquo;s incompatible with the <em>objectivity</em> of mathematics.
In response to this, Field (1980, 1989, 1998) argues that
fictionalists can account for the objectivity of mathematics by
appealing to objective facts about which mathematical sentences are
<em>true in the story of mathematics</em>, where (somewhat roughly) a
sentence is true in the story of mathematics if and only if it follows
from the axioms of our mathematical theories. And Balaguer (2009,
2021) responds by appealing to objective facts about which
mathematical sentences are <em>for-all-practical-purposes true</em>
(or <em>FAPP-true</em>), where (somewhat roughly) a sentence is
FAPP-true if and only if it would have been true if platonism had been
true).</p>

<p>
A third objection to fictionalism is based on Lewis&rsquo;s (1991:
59) claim that it would be laughably
presumptuous to suggest that we should reject our mathematical
theories for philosophical reasons, given the track records of the two
disciplines. Balaguer (2021) responds to this by claiming that
fictionalists aren&rsquo;t suggesting that we should reject our
mathematical theories, or that there&rsquo;s something <em>wrong</em>
with these theories; on the contrary, on this version of fictionalism,
there&rsquo;s <em>nothing wrong</em> with our mathematical theories
because (a) they&rsquo;re FAPP-true, and (b) the mark of goodness in
mathematics is FAPP-truth, not literal truth.</p>

<p>
A fourth objection that one might raise against fictionalism is that
it&rsquo;s not a nominalistically acceptable view because it involves
tacit reference to various kinds of abstract objects, e.g., sentence
types, or stories, or possible worlds. For responses to this
objection, see, e.g., Field (1989) and Rosen (2001).</p>

<p>
For other objections to fictionalism, see, e.g., Malament (1982),
Shapiro (1983a), Resnik (1985), Chihara (1990: chapter 8, section 5),
Horwich (1991), O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne (1994),
Burgess and Rosen (1997), Katz (1998),
Thomas (2000, 2002), Stanley (2001), Bueno (2003), Szab&oacute;
(2005), Hoffman (2004), and Burgess (2004). For responses to these
objections, see the various fictionalist works cited above, as well as
Daly (2008) and Liggins (2010). And for a discussion of all these
objections, as well as fictionalist responses to them, see the entry
on
 <a href="../fictionalism-mathematics/">fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics</a>.</p>
 
<p>
<em>Prima facie</em>, it might have seemed <em>obvious</em> that our
mathematical theories are true&mdash;and, hence, that fictionalism is
false. But on reflection, it&rsquo;s not clear that we have any good
<em>argument</em> for the claim that our mathematical theories are
strictly and literally true. Nonetheless, nominalists might not want
to give up on the truth of mathematics. If so, then they&rsquo;ll have
to reject either
 <a href="#ontarg2">[2]</a>,
 or
 <a href="#ontarg3">[3]</a>,
 or
 <a href="#ontarg10">[10]</a>
 in the argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="ParaNomiRejePrem2">4.1.4 Paraphrase Nominalism and the Rejection of Premise [2]</h4>

<p>
One very traditional way to respond to the argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>
 is to reject premise
 <a href="#ontarg2">[2]</a>
 and endorse a <em>paraphrase nominalist</em> view. According to views
of this kind, sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; are true, but
they should not be read as platonists read them; on the contrary,
these sentences should be interpreted as being equivalent to
<em>other</em> sentences&mdash;what are called <em>paraphrases</em> of
these sentences&mdash;that do <em>not</em> involve ontological
commitments to abstract objects. One view of this sort, known as
<em>if-thenism</em>, holds that, e.g., &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; can be
paraphrased by&mdash;i.e., is <em>equivalent</em> to&mdash;the
sentence &ldquo;If there were numbers, then 3 would be prime&rdquo;.
(For an early version of this sort of view, see the early Hilbert
[1899 and his letters to Frege in Frege 1980]; for later versions, see
Putnam 1967a, 1967b and Hellman 1989.) A second version of the
paraphrase strategy, which we can call <em>metamathematical
formalism</em> (see Curry 1951), is that &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; can
be paraphrased by &ldquo;&lsquo;3 is prime&rsquo; follows from the
axioms of
 arithmetic&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 A third paraphrase view holds that sentences that seem to be about
numbers are best read as being about <em>plurals</em>. For instance,
we might read &ldquo;2 + 2 = 4&rdquo; as really saying something like
this: <em>two objects and two (more) objects are four objects</em>.
(Views of this general kind have been defended by, e.g., Yi 2002,
2016; Hofweber 2005; and Moltmann 2013a.) (For a fourth version of
paraphrase nominalism, see Rayo 2008.)</p>

<p>
One problem with the various paraphrase views (not to put too fine a
point on it) is that none of the paraphrases seems very good. That is,
the paraphrases seem to misrepresent what we actually mean when we say
things like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; (and by &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean
both mathematicians and ordinary folk). What we mean, it seems, is
that 3 is prime&mdash;not that if there were numbers, then 3 would be
prime, or that the sentence &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; follows from the
axioms of arithmetic, or any such thing. And notice how the situation
here differs from cases where we do seem to have good paraphrases. For
instance, one might try to claim that if we endorse the sentence</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senA1">[A1]</dt>
<dd> The average accountant has two children,</dd>
</dl>

<p>
then we are ontologically committed to the existence of the average
accountant; but it is plausible to suppose that, in fact, we are not
so committed, because
 <a href="#senA1">[A1]</a>
 can be paraphrased by the sentence</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senA2">[A2]</dt>
<dd> On average, accountants have two children.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Moreover, it seems plausible to maintain that this is a <em>good</em>
paraphrase of
 <a href="#senA1">[A1]</a>
 because it seems clear that when people say things like [A1], what
they <em>really mean</em> are things like
 <a href="#senA2">[A2]</a>.
 But in the present case, this seems wrong: it does not seem plausible
to suppose that when ordinary people utter &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo;,
what they really mean is that if there were numbers, then 3 would be
prime. Again, it seems that what we mean here is, very simply, that 3
is prime. In short, when people say things like &ldquo;3 is
prime&rdquo;, they do not usually have any intention to be saying
anything other than what these sentences <em>seem</em> to say; and
because of this, it seems that the platonist&rsquo;s face-value
semantics for mathematical discourse is correct.</p>

<p>
If we focus on sentences like &ldquo;2 + 2 = 4&rdquo;, then the
Yi-Hofweber-Moltmann view&mdash;i.e., the view that these sentences
are about plurals&mdash;might seem to fit better with ordinary usage.
But when we switch to sentences like &ldquo;3 is
prime&rdquo;&mdash;and, even worse, &ldquo;There are infinitely many
primes&rdquo;&mdash;they start to seem cumbersome and less
plausible.</p>

<p>
You might think that paraphrase nominalists don&rsquo;t need to commit
to the thesis that their paraphrases capture the real
ordinary-language meanings of our mathematical sentences. One way to
develop this idea would be to maintain that the so-called
&ldquo;paraphrases&rdquo; of our mathematical claims should be thought
of as <em>replacements</em> for those claims&mdash;i.e., as the claims
that we should make when we&rsquo;re being careful to say exactly what
we mean, or some such thing. Philosophers who endorse replacement
views of this general kind include Chihara (1990, 2004), Dorr (2008),
Boyce (2020), and Himelright (2023a)&mdash;and perhaps some of the
paraphrase nominalists listed above.</p>

<p>
It is of course true that we can endorse a replacement view of this
kind. But it&rsquo;s important to note that if &ldquo;paraphrase
nominalism&rdquo; is defined in terms of an acceptance of premise [1]
and a rejection of premise
 <a href="#ontarg2">[2]</a>&mdash;i.e.,
 if paraphrase nominalism is supposed to give nominalists a way to
salvage the <em>truth</em> of mathematics&mdash;then replacement
nominalism is <em>not</em> a version of paraphrase nominalism. It is,
rather, a version of <em>fictionalism</em>, or <em>error theory</em>.
For if replacement nominalists don&rsquo;t claim that their
&ldquo;paraphrases&rdquo; capture the real ordinary-language meanings
of our mathematical sentences, then they&rsquo;ll presumably be
granting that platonists are right about the ordinary-language
meanings of mathematical sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo;. But
if so&mdash;if replacement nominalists admit that ordinary utterances
of &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; are best interpreted as being about
abstract mathematical objects, or as <em>purporting</em> to be about
such objects&mdash;then since replacement nominalists don&rsquo;t
believe in the existence of abstract objects, they&rsquo;ll have to
admit that such sentences are <em>not literally true</em>, and so
their view will collapse into a version of mathematical fictionalism,
or error theory. So replacement theorists would not be saving the
truth of our mathematical theories. And given this, their so-called
&ldquo;paraphrases&rdquo; would be best thought of as giving them a
way of accounting for the <em>objectivity</em> of mathematics, and the
<em>goodness</em> of mathematics; and so these paraphrases would be
playing roughly the same role in replacement nominalism that
Field&rsquo;s <em>truth in the story of mathematics</em> (or
Balaguer&rsquo;s <em>FAPP-truth</em>) plays in mathematical error
theory.</p>

paraphrase-nominalist views, see Burgess and Rosen 1997.)</p>

<h4 id="ThinTrutIsmRejePrem3">4.1.5 Thin-Truth-ism and the Rejection of Premise [3]</h4>

<p>
A third nominalist strategy is to reject premise
 <a href="#ontarg3">[3]</a>
 and the standard criterion of ontological commitment. The most
obvious way to do this is to endorse the following view: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> simple mathematical sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo;
should be read as being of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rdquo;
and as being about abstract objects (e.g., &ldquo;3&rdquo; should be
taken as denoting the number 3, which could only be an abstract
object, and &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; should be taken as being a claim
about that object); and </li>

<li> abstract objects&mdash;in particular, mathematical objects like
the number 3&mdash;don&rsquo;t exist (and the claim here is that they
don&rsquo;t have any sort of being whatsoever, so this is not a
Meinongian view); but </li>

<li> sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; are still literally true.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thus, on this view, a claim about an object <i>a</i> can be true even
if that object doesn&rsquo;t exist at all. Let&rsquo;s call this view
<em>thin-truth-ism</em>. Views of this general kind have been endorsed
by Azzouni (1994, 2004), Salmon (1998), and Bueno (2005).</p>

<p>
Thin-truth-ists endorse a similar view of existence claims. For
instance, on their view, the sentence &ldquo;There are infinitely many
prime numbers&rdquo; is literally true, even though there are no such
things as numbers. This might look like a contradiction, but
it&rsquo;s not, because according to thin-truth-ism, existential
expressions (or quantifiers) like &lsquo;there is&rsquo; are
ambiguous.</p>

<p>
Most philosophers find this view extremely hard to believe. Indeed, a
lot of philosophers would say that it&rsquo;s simply confused, or
incoherent. But, in fact, thin-truth-ism is not incoherent. A better
way to formulate the problem with the view is as follows: in giving up
on the standard criterion of ontological commitment, thin-truth-ists
seem to be using &ldquo;true&rdquo; in a non-standard way. Most of us
would say that if there is no such thing as the number 3, and if
&ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; is read at face value (i.e., as being about
the number 3), then it follows trivially that &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo;
could not be true. Or more generally, most of us would say that if
there is no such thing as the object <i>a</i>, then sentences of the
form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rdquo; cannot be literally true.
This, of course, is just to say that most of us accept the standard
criterion of ontological commitment articulated in
 <a href="#OneOverManyArgu">section 3</a>;
 but the point here is that this criterion seems to be built into the
standard meaning of words like &ldquo;true&rdquo;. Indeed, this
explains why the standard criterion of ontological commitment is so
widely accepted.</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a quick argument for thinking that thin-truth-ists are
using &ldquo;true&rdquo; in a non-standard way: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>sentences like &ldquo;Mars doesn&rsquo;t exist at all, but
it&rsquo;s red&rdquo; seem contradictory to us (ordinary speakers of
English); but </li>

<li> thin-truth-ism implies that they&rsquo;re not contradictory; and
so </li>

<li> thin-truth-ism is out of step with ordinary usage.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Another worry one might raise about thin-truth-ism is that it only
differs from fictionalism in a merely verbal way. Let
&ldquo;thin-true&rdquo; express the kind of truth that thin-truth-ists
have in mind, and let &ldquo;thick-true&rdquo; express the kind of
truth that everyone else in the debate has in mind (i.e., platonists,
fictionalists, paraphrase nominalists, and so on). Given this,
fictionalists and thin-truth-ists will both endorse all of the
following claims: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> platonists are right that &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; is a claim
about the number 3; and </li>

<li> there is no such thing as the number 3; so </li>

<li> &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t thick-true; but despite
this, </li>

<li> &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; is thin-true. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, of course, thin-truth-ists and fictionalists will disagree about
whether &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; is <em>true</em>, but this will
collapse into a disagreement about whether thin-truth or thick-truth
is <em>real</em> truth, and this is just a disagreement about what the
word &ldquo;true&rdquo; means in ordinary folk English, and it&rsquo;s
hard to see why an empirical question about how the folk happen to use
some word is relevant to the debate about the existence of
mathematical objects.</p>

<p>
(Meinongians would also reject premise
 <a href="#ontarg3">[3]</a>;
 but Meinongianism is not happily thought of as a version of
nominalism. Indeed, as we saw in
 <a href="#TaxoPosi">section 2</a>,
 it seems that Meinongianism is a non-standard version of platonism;
for it implies that there <em>are</em> numbers and that they are
non-physical, non-mental, non-spatiotemporal, and so on.)</p>

<h4 id="CarnConvRejePrem10">4.1.6 Carnapian Conventionalism and the Rejection of Premise [10]</h4>

<p>
A final version of anti-platonism, which we can call
<em>conventionalism</em>, involves the rejection of premise
 <a href="#ontarg10">[10]</a>.
 According to this view, sentences like &ldquo;3 exists&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;There are numbers&rdquo; are true because they&rsquo;re
<em>analytic</em>&mdash;i.e., because they follow from the semantic
rules of the language. In essence, according to this view, we&rsquo;ve
just collectively <em>stipulated</em>&mdash;through our use of
mathematical sentences like &ldquo;There are some prime numbers
between 10 and 20&rdquo;&mdash;that these sentences are to be true.
Thus, nothing is required of reality to make these sentences true, and
so it doesn&rsquo;t follow from the truth of &ldquo;There are
numbers&rdquo; that there are abstract objects that actually exist in
reality. Views of this general kind have been endorsed by Carnap
(1950), Rayo (2013), Warren (2020), and perhaps Hale and Wright
(2009). Jenkins (2008) also endorses a
view in this general vicinity, although her view is a bit
different.</p>

<p>
It can be hard to pin down the difference between this view and
fictionalism. Warren seems to think that the difference boils down to
a <em>metasemantic</em> disagreement. In particular, borrowing some
lingo from Warren, we can say that whereas fictionalists endorse a
<em>bottom-up</em> metasemantics (i.e., a view that says that semantic
facts about sentences are determined by semantic facts about (a) words
and (b) compositional semantic rules), conventionalists endorse a
<em>top-down</em> metasemantics (i.e., a view that says that semantic
facts about subsentential expressions are determined by semantic facts
about sentences). More specifically, on a Warren-style top-down
metasemantics, the principle of charity (which tells us to interpret
people, as far as possible, as endorsing truths) more or less dictates
that sentences like &ldquo;3 is prime&rdquo; are true.</p>

<p>
The standard view since Quine (1948), in analytic philosophy, is that
conventionalist views of the kind under discussion here aren&rsquo;t
true because sentences of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;There are some <i>F</i>s&rdquo;&mdash;aren&rsquo;t
analytic. The reason these sentences aren&rsquo;t analytic according
to this view is that </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>the standard criterion of ontological commitment articulated in
 <a href="#OneOverManyArgu">section 3</a>
 is true, and so sentences of the form &ldquo;<i>a</i> is
<i>F</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;There are some <i>F</i>s&rdquo; can&rsquo;t
be true unless objects of the relevant kinds actually exist in
reality; and </li>

<li> we can&rsquo;t define objects into existence.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="PropRela">4.2 Properties and Relations</h3>

<p>
We can construct an ontological-commitment argument for a platonistic
view of properties and relations&mdash;analogous to the argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>&mdash;by
 locating some ordinary sentences that seem to be both true and about
properties and/or relations. We will focus on sentences about
properties, but exactly parallel remarks could be made about
relations. You might begin here by considering sentences like the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senP1">[P1]</dt>
<dd> Mars possesses the property of redness.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But, <em>prima facie</em>, it seems that we can plausibly take [P1] to
be equivalent to the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senP2">[P2]</dt>
<dd> Mars is red.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And if
 <a href="#senP1">[P1]</a>
 is equivalent to
 <a href="#senP2">[P2]</a>,
 then we can endorse a paraphrase-nominalist view of [P1] by pointing
out that, according to the standard criterion of ontological
commitment, [P2] doesn&rsquo;t commit us to the existence of a
property. But there are other sentences about properties that
don&rsquo;t seem so easily paraphrased&mdash;e.g., sentences like</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senP3">[P3]</dt>
<dd> There&rsquo;s at least one property that Mars and Venus both
possess.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It&rsquo;s at least initially plausible to suppose that
 <a href="#senP3">[P3]</a>
 is true, and that it commits to the existence of a property, and that
properties are abstract objects. If we wanted to, we could construct
an argument here&mdash;an argument for a platonistic view of
properties that began with the claim that [P3] is true&mdash;that
exactly paralleled the argument in
 <a href="#ontargs">[1]&ndash;[11]</a>,
 i.e., the argument for a platonistic view of numbers articulated in
 <a href="#MathObje">section 4.1</a>.
 We won&rsquo;t bother to do this here, but it&rsquo;s important to
note that ontological-commitment arguments for the existence of
properties rely on premises that are exactly analogous to the premises
in the argument in [1]&ndash;[11]. And this means that all the same
avenues of response are available to anti-platonists&mdash;and, hence,
that platonists would need to undermine all of the various
anti-platonist views.</p>

<p>
For example, platonists would need to undermine
<em>conceptualism</em>&mdash;the view that properties are mental
objects that exist in our heads, rather than abstract objects. Many of
the arguments listed in
 <a href="#PsycRejePrem8">section 4.1.1</a>
 against psychologistic views of numbers also tell against the
conceptualistic view of properties and relations. For instance, as
Russell (1912: chapter IX) points out, property claims and relational
claims seem to be <em>objective</em>; e.g., the fact that Mount
Everest is taller than Mont Blanc is a fact that holds independently
of us; but conceptualism about universals entails that if we all died,
it would no longer be true that Mount Everest bears the taller than
relation to Mont Blanc, because that relation would no longer exist.
And, second, conceptualism seems simply to get the semantics of our
property discourse wrong, for it seems to confuse properties with our
ideas of them. The English sentence &ldquo;Red is a color&rdquo; does
not seem to be about anybody&rsquo;s idea of redness; it seems to be
about redness, the actual color, which, it seems, is something
objective.</p>

<p>
Second, platonists would need to undermine the immanent realist view
that properties exist <em>in</em> the objects that instantiate
them&mdash;either as <em>universals</em> (so that, e.g., there is
<em>one</em> property of roundness that exists in Mars and Venus and
so on), or as <em>tropes</em> (so that, e.g., there is a
roundness-trope that exists in Mars, and a <em>different</em>
roundness-trope, and so on). There are many different arguments that
platonists might run against immanent realist views of properties. For
example, they might argue that (a) immanent realism is incompatible
with the existence of <em>uninstantiated</em> properties, and (b) we
need to countenance the existence of such properties. One reason to
think that we need to endorse the existence of uninstantiated
properties is that we need them to be the semantic contents of
uninstantiated predicates; e.g., you might think that we need to
endorse the existence of the property <em>being a witch</em> to
account for the meaningfulness of sentences like &ldquo;There are no
witches&rdquo;&mdash;and for the truth of sentences like &ldquo;Jane
believes that the property of being a witch is
uninstantiated&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Third, platonists would need to respond to paraphrase nominalist
views. There are a few different recent nominalization programs worth
considering here. First, Moltmann (2013b) argues that words that seem
to refer to universals (e.g., &ldquo;redness&rdquo;) actually refer
plurally to all the possible tropes of the given kind; so, e.g., on
this view, &ldquo;redness&rdquo; refers plurally to all possible
redness tropes. One problem with this view is that it commits to the
existence of <em>possible objects</em>; but if these aren&rsquo;t
abstract objects, then they&rsquo;re presumably Lewisian possible
objects; and one might reasonably want to avoid committing to the
existence of Lewisian possible objects.</p>

<p>
Another paraphrase-type view, endorsed by Himelright (2021), is to
paraphrase sentences like
 <a href="#senP3">[P3]</a>
 with counterfactual sentences like the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senP3a">[P3a]</dt>
<dd> If the entire plenitude of Lewisian worlds had existed, then it
would have been the case that there was at least one
one-place-predicate token that applied to both Mars and Venus.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
One problem with
 <a href="#senP3a">[P3a]</a>
 is that it clearly doesn&rsquo;t capture the actual ordinary-language
meaning of
 <a href="#senP3">[P3]</a>.
 Himelright acknowledges this and offers [P3a] as a
<em>replacement</em>&mdash;in the sense of
 <a href="#ParaNomiRejePrem2">section 4.1.4</a>.
 But given this, Himelright&rsquo;s view isn&rsquo;t really a
paraphrase view; it is rather a fictionalist/error-theoretic view
according to which [P3] is literally false. In particular, it
isn&rsquo;t all that different from Balaguer&rsquo;s (2021)
error-theoretic view, according to which sentences like [P3] are false
but <em>for-all-practical-purposes true</em>, where a sentence is
for-all-practical-purposes true if and only if it would have been true
if the entire plenitudinous realm of properties had existed.</p>

<p>
A final paraphrase-type view of our talk of properties and relations
can be given in a <em>higher-order logical language</em>. For example,
we could paraphrase
 <a href="#senP3">[P3]</a>
 with the following sentence:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="senP3b">[P3b]</dt>
<dd> \(\exists X(Xm \amp Xv)\),</dd>
</dl>

<p>
where &ldquo;<i>m</i>&rdquo; denotes Mars, &ldquo;<i>v</i>&rdquo;
denotes Venus, &ldquo;\(\exists\)&rdquo; is a second-order quantifier
that quantifies over predicate positions, and &ldquo;<i>X</i>&rdquo;
is a second-order variable. Now, on one way of indicating what
 <a href="#senP3b">[P3b]</a>
 means&mdash;and until recently, this was the standard reading of such
sentences&mdash;[P3b] is no help to anti-platonists because it commits
to the existence of properties. But in recent years, higher-order
metaphysicians have pointed out that we don&rsquo;t have to interpret
higher-order sentences like [P3b] as being about properties. Rather,
we can just learn higher-order languages on their own terms,
<em>without translating them into English</em>, and we can take [P3b]
as saying something that isn&rsquo;t about properties at all.
It&rsquo;s simply a higher-order way of generalizing from
 <a href="#senP3">[P3]</a>.
 (Dorr forthcoming develops an argument for a view of this kind, but
see also Bacon 2024 and Fritz &amp; Jones 2024b.)
The most interesting version of the
higher-order view, in my opinion, is the view that commits to the idea
that the higher-order sentences in question are true
<em>paraphrases</em>, capturing the actual meanings of
ordinary-language claims about properties, as opposed to replacements.
But the paraphrase version of the view is a controversial empirical
claim, and it&rsquo;s not clear that there&rsquo;s very good evidence
for it.</p>

<p>
Another view that employs higher-order resources, developed by Trueman
(2024) and Button and Trueman (2024), combines a
fictionalist/error-theoretic view of <em>universals</em> with a
realist view of <em>properties</em>, where </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> universals are (or are <em>supposed</em> to be) objects of a kind
that are picked out by words like &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; and
&ldquo;redness&rdquo;, and </li>

<li> properties aren&rsquo;t objects at all and are, rather,
higher-type entities picked out by expressions like &ldquo;&hellip;is
wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;&hellip;is red&rdquo;. </li>
</ol>

<p>
It might seem that this view is just a non-standard version of
platonism&mdash;because it might seem that properties of this kind
could only be abstract entities. And this is especially true if we
endorse the existence of <em>uninstantiated</em> properties, as Button
and Trueman do. Now, higher-order-ists of the Button-Trueman kind
could respond here by claiming that the idea that these properties are
abstract is unintelligible&mdash;because if we tried to articulate
this idea, we&rsquo;d end up saying things like &ldquo;Is red is
abstract&rdquo;, which isn&rsquo;t even grammatical. But there might
be ways to press the issue here and force higher-order-ists to choose
between </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> a non-standard version of platonism according to which properties
are non-physical, non-mental entities, and </li>

<li> a nominalistic view according to which properties don&rsquo;t
really exist in an &ldquo;out-there-in-reality&rdquo; kind of
way.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Prop">4.3 Propositions</h3>

<p>
We turn now to ontological-commitment arguments for the existence of
propositions. To construct an argument of this kind, we need to find
some sentences that involve ontological commitments to propositions.
Probably the most widely discussed sentences here are <em>belief
ascriptions</em>, i.e., sentences like the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="senO">[O]</dt>
<dd> Obama believes that snow is white.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The idea, then, is to argue for a platonistic view of propositions by
arguing that </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> sentences like
 <a href="#senO">[O]</a>
 are true, and </li>

<li> they involve ontological commitments to propositions, and </li>

<li> propositions are abstract objects. </li>
</ol>

<p>
(The most important figure in the development of arguments of this
kind is Frege [1892, 1918/19]. Other relevant figures [who
wouldn&rsquo;t all endorse an argument of this kind] include Russell
[1905, 1911], Church [1950, 1954], Quine [1956], Kaplan [1968, 1989],
Kripke [1972, 1979], Schiffer [1977, 1987, 1994], Perry [1979], Evans
[1981], Peacocke [1981], Barwise and Perry [1983], Bealer [1982,
1993], Zalta [1983, 1988], Katz [1986], Salmon [1986], Soames [1987,
2014], Forbes [1987], Crimmins and Perry [1989], Richard [1990],
Crimmins [1998], Recanati [1993, 2000], King [1995, 2014], Braun
[1998], and Saul [1999].)</p>

<p>
Why think that sentences like
 <a href="#senO">[O]</a>
 involve ontological commitments to propositions? Well, the first
point to note here is that these sentences contain
<em>&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses</em>&mdash;where a
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause is simply the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; added
to the front of a complete sentence, as in, e.g., &ldquo;that snow is
white&rdquo;. And the second point to note is that, in English,
<em>&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses are singular terms</em>. A common way
to illustrate this second point&mdash;see, e.g., Bealer (1982 and
1993) and Schiffer (1994)&mdash;is to appeal to arguments like the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>I.</dt>
<dd> Obama believes that snow is white.
<br />
Therefore, Obama believes something (namely, that snow is white).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This argument seems to be valid, and platonists claim that the best
and only tenable explanation of this fact involves a commitment to the
idea that the &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause in this argument&mdash;i.e.,
&ldquo;that snow is white&rdquo;&mdash;is a singular term. So,
returning to
 <a href="#senO">[O]</a>,
 the idea here is that the logical form of [O] is &ldquo;<em>o is
B-related to t</em>&rdquo;, where &ldquo;<i>B</i>&rdquo; expresses a
two-place belief relation, &ldquo;<i>o</i>&rdquo; denotes Obama, and
&ldquo;<i>t</i>&rdquo; denotes the thing that Obama is being said to
believe&mdash;namely, <em>that snow is white</em>. And so if [O] is
<em>true</em> (and it sure seems to be), then according to the
standard criterion of ontological commitment, the thing that Obama is
being said to believe&mdash;namely, <em>that snow is
white</em>&mdash;has to actually <em>exist</em>.</p>

<p>
But what kinds of object is this? What kinds of objects do our
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses refer to? It might seem that they refer to
<em>facts</em>, or to <em>states of affairs</em>. For instance, it
might seem that &ldquo;that snow is white&rdquo; refers to the fact
that snow is white. This, however, is a mistake (at least in
connection with the &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses that appear in belief
reports). For since beliefs can be false, it follows that the
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses in our belief reports refer to things that
can be false. For example, if Sammy is seven years old, then the
sentence &ldquo;Sammy believes that snow is powdered sugar&rdquo;
could be true; but if this sentence is true, then its
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause refers to doesn&rsquo;t refer to a fact,
because (obviously) there is no such thing as the fact that snow is
powdered sugar.</p>

<p>
These considerations suggest that the referents of the
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses that appear in belief ascriptions are
things that can be true or false. But if this is right, then it seems
that the objects of belief&mdash;i.e., the things that the
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses in our belief sentences refer to&mdash;are
either <em>sentences</em> or <em>propositions</em>. The standard
platonist view is that they are propositions. Before we consider their
arguments for this claim, we need to say a few words about the
different kinds of sentential views that one might endorse.</p>

<p>
To begin with, we need to distinguish between sentence <em>types</em>
and sentence <em>tokens</em>. To appreciate the difference, consider
the following indented sentences:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Cats are cute.
<br />
Cats are cute.</p>
</div>

<p>
We have here two different tokens of a single sentence type. Thus, a
token is an actual physical thing, located at a specific place in
spacetime; it is a pile of ink on a page (structured in an appropriate
way), or a sound wave, or a collection of pixels on a computer screen,
or something of this sort. A type, on the other hand, can be tokened
numerous times but is not identical with any single token. Thus, a
sentence type is an abstract object. And so if we are looking for an
anti-platonist view of what &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses refer to, or
what belief reports are about, we cannot say that they&rsquo;re about
sentence types; we have to say they&rsquo;re about sentence
tokens.</p>

<p>
A second distinction that needs to be drawn here is between sentence
tokens that are <em>external</em>, or public, and sentence tokens that
are <em>internal</em>, or private. Examples of external sentence
tokens were given in the last paragraph&mdash;piles of ink, sound
waves, and so on. An internal sentence token, on the other hand,
exists inside a particular person&rsquo;s head. There is a wide-spread
view&mdash;due mainly to Jerry Fodor (1975 and 1987) but adopted by
many others, e.g., Stich (1983)&mdash;that we are able to perform
cognitive tasks (e.g., think, remember information, and have beliefs)
only because we are capable of storing information in our heads in a
neural language (often called <em>mentalese</em>, or the <em>language
of thought</em>). In connection with beliefs, the idea here is that to
believe that, say, snow is white, is to have a neural sentence stored
in your head (in a belief way, as opposed to a desire way, or some
other way) that means in mentalese that snow is white.</p>

<p>
This gives us two different anti-platonist alternatives to the view
that belief reports involve references to propositions. First, there
is the conceptualistic (or mentalistic) view that belief reports
involve references to sentences in our heads, or mentalese sentence
tokens. And, second, there is the physicalistic view that belief
reports involve references to external sentence tokens, i.e., to piles
of ink, and so on (versions of this view have been endorsed by Carnap
(1947), Davidson (1967), and Leeds (1979)).</p>

<p>
There are a number of arguments that suggest that ordinary belief
reports cannot be taken to be about (internal or external) sentences
and that we have to take them to be about propositions. We will
rehearse one such argument here, an argument that goes back at least
to Church (1950). Suppose that Boris and Jerry both live in cold
climates and are very familiar with snow. Thus, they both believe that
snow is white. But Boris lives in Russia and speaks only Russian,
whereas Jerry lives in Minnesota and speaks only English. Now,
consider the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>II.</dt>
<dd>Boris believes that snow is white.
<br />
Jerry believes that snow is white.
<br />
Therefore, there&rsquo;s at least one thing that Boris and Jerry both
believe, namely, that snow is white.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This argument seems clearly valid; but this seems to rule out the idea
that the belief reports here are about sentence tokens. For (a) in
order to account for the validity of the argument, we have to take the
two &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses to refer to the same thing, and (b)
there is no sentence token that they could both refer to. First of
all, they couldn&rsquo;t refer to any external sentence token (or, for
that matter, any sentence type associated with any natural language),
because </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li> if the first &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause refers to such a sentence,
it would presumably be a Russian sentence, since Boris speaks only
 Russian;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 and </li>

<li> if the second &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause refers to such a
sentence, it would presumably be an English sentence, since Jerry
speaks only English; and so </li>

<li> the two &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses cannot both refer to the same
external sentence token (or natural-language sentence type). </li>
</ol>

<p>
And second, they cannot refer to any mentalese sentence token, because
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li> if the first &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause refers to such a sentence,
it would presumably be in Boris&rsquo;s head; and </li>

<li> if the second &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause refers to such a
sentence, it would presumably be in Jerry&rsquo;s head; and so </li>

<li> the two &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses cannot both refer to the same
mentalese sentence token.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Therefore, it seems to follow that the &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses in
the above argument do not refer to sentence tokens of any kind. And
since these are ordinary belief ascriptions, it follows that, in
general, the &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses that appear in ordinary belief
ascriptions do not refer to sentence tokens.</p>

<p>
Now, as it&rsquo;s formulated here, this argument doesn&rsquo;t rule
out the view that &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses refer to mentalese
sentence types, but the argument can be extended to rule out that view
as well (e.g., one might do this by talking not of an American and a
Russian but of two creatures with different internal languages of
thought). We won&rsquo;t run through the details of this here, since,
as we&rsquo;ve seen, anti-platonists can&rsquo;t claim that
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses refer to types anyway, because types are
abstract objects. But if we assume that that version of the argument
is cogent as well, then it follows that &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses
don&rsquo;t refer to sentences of any kind at all and, so it seems
that they must refer to
 propositions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It&rsquo;s important to note that the issue so far has been purely
<em>semantic</em>. What the above argument suggests is that regardless
of whether there are any such things as propositions, our
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses are best interpreted as referring (or
purporting to refer) to such objects. Platonists then claim that if
this is correct, then there must be such things as propositions,
because, clearly, many of our belief ascriptions are <em>true</em>.
For instance, &ldquo;Obama believes that snow is white&rdquo; is true;
thus, if the above analysis of &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses is correct,
and if the standard criterion of ontological commitment is correct, it
follows that there is such a thing as the proposition that snow is
white.</p>

<p>
Finally, it seems that propositions could only be abstract objects.
Indeed, the above arguments against the idea that
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-clauses refer to sentences already seems to rule
out physicalistic and psychologistic views of propositions.</p>

<p>
So that is how the ontological-commitment argument for a platonistic
view of propositions proceeds.</p>

<p>
How might anti-platonists respond to this argument? Given the
implausibility of physicalistic and psychologistic views of
propositions, it seems that the only hope for anti-platonists is to
develop a nominalistic views. One way to do this would be to develop a
fictionalistic/error-theoretic view. Balaguer (1998b) develops a view
of this kind that mirrors his fictionalistic view of mathematics. On
this view, sentences like
 <a href="#senO">[O]</a>
 are strictly speaking false (because their &ldquo;that&rdquo;-clause
are supposed to refer to propositions, and there are no such things as
propositions) but they&rsquo;re for-all-practical-purposes true
because they would have been true if the entire plenitude of
propositions existed.</p>

<p>
A second way for nominalists to proceed would be to develop a
paraphrase view. The paraphrase views of mathematical discourse
don&rsquo;t carry over very well to the case of propositions, but some
of the paraphrase views of properties seem more applicable. Perhaps
most notably, the higher-order views of properties discussed in
 <a href="#PropRela">section 4.2</a>
 seems to carry over seamlessly to the case of propositions. E.g.,
Dorr&rsquo;s (forthcoming) paraphrase view seems to work in the same
way; for just as we can quantify over predicate positions without
claiming that we&rsquo;re quantifying over properties, so too we can
quantify over sentence positions without claiming that we&rsquo;re
quantifying over propositions.</p>

<p>
Finally, the Moltmann (2013b) view of properties discussed in
 <a href="#PropRela">section 4.2</a>
 carries over to the case of propositions as well, and so does the
Button-Trueman view of properties discussed in
 <a href="#PropRela">section 4.2</a>
 (see Trueman 2020 and Button &amp; Trueman 2024). </p>

<h3 id="SentType">4.4 Sentence Types</h3>

<p>
Linguistics is a branch of science that tells us things about
sentences. For instance, it says things like</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>[A]</dt>
<dd> &ldquo;The cat is on the mat&rdquo; is a well-formed sentence of
English,</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>[B]</dt>
<dd> &ldquo;Visiting relatives can be boring&rdquo; is structurally
ambiguous.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The quoted sentences that appear in [A] and [B] are singular terms;
e.g., &ldquo;&lsquo;The cat is on the mat&rsquo;&rdquo; refers to the
sentence &ldquo;The cat is on the mat&rdquo;, and [A] says of this
sentence that it has a certain property, namely, that of being a
well-formed English sentence. Thus, sentences like [A] commit to the
existence of sentences. And so if [A] is true, then <em>sentences
exist</em>.</p>

<p>
Now, one might hold a physicalistic view here according to which
linguistics is about actual (external) sentence tokens, e.g., piles of
ink and verbal sound waves. (This view was popular in the early part
of the twentieth century&mdash;see, e.g., Bloomfield 1933, Harris
1954, and Quine 1953.) Or alternatively, one might hold a
conceptualistic view, maintaining that linguistics is essentially a
branch of psychology; the main proponent of this view is Noam Chomsky
(1965: chapter 1), who thinks of a grammar for a natural language as
being about an ideal speaker-hearer&rsquo;s knowledge of the given
language, but see also Sapir (1921), Stich (1972), and Fodor (1981).
But there are reasons for thinking that neither the physicalist nor
the conceptualist approach is tenable and that the only plausible way
to interpret linguistic theory is as being about sentence types, which
of course, are abstract objects (proponents of the platonistic view
include Katz [1981], Soames [1985], and Langendoen &amp; Postal
[1984]). Katz constructs arguments here that are very similar to the
argument for a platonistic view of numbers discussed in
 <a href="#MathObje">section 4.1</a>).
 One argument here is that linguistic theory seems to have
consequences that are (a) true and (b) about sentences that have never
been tokened (internally or externally), e.g., sentences like
&ldquo;Green umbrellas slithered unwittingly toward Arizona&rsquo;s
favorite toaster&rdquo;. (Of course, now that we&rsquo;ve written this
sentence down, it has been tokened, but it seems likely that before we
wrote it down here, it had never been tokened.) Standard linguistic
theory entails that many sentences that have never been tokened
(internally or externally) are well-formed English sentences. Thus, if
we want to claim that our linguistic theories are true, then we have
to accept these consequences, or theorems, of linguistic theory. But
these theorems are clearly not true of any sentence tokens (because
the sentences in question have never been tokened) and so, it is
argued, they must be true of sentence types.</p>

<h3 id="PossWorl">4.5 Possible Worlds</h3>

<p>
It is a very widely held view among contemporary philosophers that we
need to appeal to entities known as <em>possible worlds</em> in order
to account for various phenomena. There are dozens of phenomena that
philosophers have thought should be explained in terms of possible
worlds, but to name just one, it is often argued that semantic theory
is best carried out in terms of possible worlds. Consider, for
example, the attempt to state the truth conditions of sentences of the
form &ldquo;It is necessary that <i>S</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;It is
possible that <i>S</i>&rdquo; (where <i>S</i> is any sentence). It is
widely believed that the best theory here is that a sentence of the
form &ldquo;It is necessary that <i>S</i>&rdquo; is true if and only
if <i>S</i> is true in all possible worlds, and a sentence of the form
&ldquo;It is possible that <i>S</i>&rdquo; is true if and only if
<i>S</i> is true in at least one possible world. Now, if we add to
this theory the premise that at least one sentence of the form
&ldquo;It is possible that <i>S</i>&rdquo; is true&mdash;and this
seems undeniable&mdash;then we are led to the result that possible
worlds exist.</p>

<p>
Now, as was the case with numbers, properties, and sentences, not
everyone who endorses possible worlds thinks that they are abstract
objects; indeed, one leading proponent of the use of possible worlds
in philosophy and semantics&mdash;namely, David Lewis
(1986)&mdash;maintains that possible worlds are of the same kind as
the actual world, and so he takes them to be concrete objects.
However, most philosophers who endorse possible worlds take them to be
abstract objects (see, e.g., Plantinga 1974, 1976; Adams 1974;
Chisholm 1976; and Pollock 1984). It is important to note, however,
that possible worlds are very often not taken to constitute a new kind
of abstract object. For instance, it is very popular to maintain that
a possible world is just a set of propositions. (To see how a set of
propositions could serve as a possible world, notice that if you
believed in full-blown possible worlds&mdash;worlds that are just like
the actual world in kind&mdash;then you would say that corresponding
to each of these worlds, there is a set of propositions that
completely and accurately describes the given world, or is true of
that world. Many philosophers who don&rsquo;t believe in full-blown
possible worlds maintain that these sets of propositions are good
enough&mdash;i.e., that we can take them to <em>be</em> possible
worlds.) Or alternatively, one might think of a possible world as a
<em>state of affairs</em>, or as a <em>way things could be</em>. In so
doing, one might think of these as constituting a new kind of abstract
object, or one might think of them as properties&mdash;giant, complex
properties that the entire universe may or may not possess. For
instance, one might say that the actual universe possesses the
property of being such that snow is white and grass is green and San
Francisco is north of Los Angeles, and so on.</p>

<p>
In any event, if possible worlds are indeed abstract objects, and if
the above argument for the existence of possible worlds is cogent,
then this would give us another argument for platonism.</p>

<h3 id="LogiObje">4.6 Logical Objects</h3>

<p>
Frege (1884, 1893/1903) appealed to sentences like the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>[D]</dt>
<dd> The number of <i>F</i>s is identical to the number of <i>G</i>s
if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
<i>F</i>s and the <i>G</i>s.</dd>
<dt>[E]</dt>
<dd> The direction of line <i>a</i> is identical to the direction of
line <i>b</i> if and only if <i>a</i> is parallel to <i>b</i>.</dd>
<dt>[F]</dt>
<dd> The shape of figure <i>a</i> is identical to the shape of figure
<i>b</i> if and only if <i>a</i> is geometrically <em>similar</em> to
<i>b</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
On Frege&rsquo;s view, principles like these are true, and so they
commit us to the existence of numbers, lines, and shapes. Now, of
course, we have already gone through a platonistic
argument&mdash;indeed, a Fregean argument&mdash;for the existence of
numbers. Moreover, the standard platonist view is that the argument
for the existence of mathematical objects is entirely general,
covering all branches of mathematics, including geometry, so that on
this view, we already have reason to believe in lines and shapes, as
well as numbers. But it is worth noting that in contrast to most
contemporary platonists, Frege thought of numbers, lines, and shapes
as logical objects, because on his view, these things can be
identified with <em>extensions of concepts</em>. What is the extension
of a concept? Well, simplifying a bit, it is just the set of things
falling under the given concept. Thus, for instance, the extension of
the concept <em>white</em> is just the set of white
 things.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 And so the idea here is that since logic is centrally concerned with
predicates and their corresponding concepts, and since extensions are
tied to concepts, we can think of extensions as logical objects. Thus,
since Frege thinks that numbers, lines, and shapes can be identified
with extensions, on his view, we can think of these things as logical
objects.</p>

<p>
Frege&rsquo;s definitions of numbers, lines, and shapes in terms of
extensions can be formulated as follows: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li> the number of <i>F</i>s is the extension of the concept
<em>equinumerous with <i>F</i></em> (that is, it is the set of all
concepts that have exactly as many objects falling under them as does
<i>F</i>); and </li>

<li> the direction of line <i>a</i> is the extension of the concept
<em>parallel to a</em>; and </li>

<li> the shape of figure <i>a</i> is the extension of the concept
<em>geometrically similar to a</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A similar approach can be used to define other kinds of logical
objects. For instance, the truth value of the proposition <i>p</i> can
be identified with the extension of the concept <em>equivalent to
<i>p</i></em> (i.e., the concept <em>true if and only if <i>p</i> is
true</em>).</p>

<p>
It should be noted that contemporary neo-Fregeans reject the
identification of directions and shapes and so on with extensions of
concepts. They hold instead that directions and shapes are <em>sui
generis</em> abstract objects.</p>

<p>
For contemporary work on this issue, see, e.g., Wright (1983), Boolos
(1987), and Anderson and Zalta (2004).</p>

<h3 id="FictObje">4.7 Fictional Objects</h3>

<p>
Finally, a number of philosophers (see, most notably, van Inwagen
[1977], Wolterstorff [1980], and Zalta [1983, 1988]) think that
fictional objects, or fictional characters, are best thought of as
abstract objects. (Salmon [1998], Thomasson [1999], and Voltolini
[2020] also take fictional objects to be abstract, but their views are
a bit different; they maintain that abstract fictional objects are
created by humans.) To see why one might be drawn to this view,
consider the following sentence:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="senG">[G]</dt>
<dd> Sherlock Holmes is a detective.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Now, if this sentence actually appeared in one of the Holmes stories
by Arthur Conan Doyle, then that token of it would not be
true&mdash;it would be a bit of fiction. But if you were telling a
child about these stories, and the child asked, &ldquo;What does
Holmes do for a living?&rdquo;, and you answered by uttering
 <a href="#senG">[G]</a>,
 then it seems plausible to suppose that what you have said is true.
But if it is true, then it seems that its singular term,
&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes&rdquo;, must refer to something. What it refers
to, according to the view in question, is an abstract object, in
particular, a fictional character. In short, present-day utterances of
[G] are true statements about a fictional character; but if Doyle had
put [G] into one his stories, it would not have been true, and its
singular term would not have referred to anything.</p>

<p>
There is a worry about this view that can be put in the following way:
if there is such a thing as Sherlock Holmes, then it has arms and
legs; but if Sherlock Holmes is an abstract object, as this view
supposes, then it does not have arms and legs (because abstract
objects are non-physical); therefore, it cannot be the case that
Sherlock Holmes exists and is an abstract object, for this leads to
contradiction. Various solutions to this problem have been proposed.
For instance, Zalta argues that in addition to <em>exemplifying</em>
certain properties, abstract objects also <em>encode</em> properties.
The fictional character Sherlock Holmes encodes the properties of
being a detective, being male, being English, having arms and legs,
and so on. But it does not exemplify any of these properties. It
exemplifies the properties of being abstract, being a fictional
character, having been thought of first by Arthur Conan Doyle, and so
on. Zalta maintains that in English, the copula
&ldquo;is&rdquo;&mdash;as in &ldquo;<i>a</i> is
<i>F</i>&rdquo;&mdash;is ambiguous; it can be read as ascribing either
property exemplification or property encoding. When we say
&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes is a detective&rdquo;, we are saying that
Holmes <em>encodes</em> the property of being a detective; and when we
say &ldquo;Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character&rdquo;, we are
saying that Holmes <em>exemplifies</em> the property of being a
fictional character. (It should be noted that Zalta employs the device
of encoding with respect to all abstract objects&mdash;mathematical
objects, logical objects, and so on&mdash;not just fictional objects.
Also, Zalta points out that his theory of encoding is based on a
similar theory developed by Ernst Mally [1912].)</p>

<p>
Those who endorse a platonistic view of fictional objects maintain
that there is no good paraphrase of sentences like
 <a href="#senG">[G]</a>,
 but one might question this. For instance, one might maintain that
[G] can be paraphrased by a sentence like this:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes is a detective&rdquo; is
true-in-the-Holmes-stories.</p>
</div>

<p>
If we read
 <a href="#senG">[G]</a>
 in this way, then it is not about Sherlock Holmes at all; rather, it
is about the Sherlock Holmes stories. Thus, in order to believe [G],
so interpreted, one would have to believe in the existence of these
stories. Now, one might try to take an anti-platonistic view of the
nature of stories, but there are problems with such views, and so we
might end up with a platonistic view here anyway&mdash;a view that
takes sentences like [G] to be about stories and stories to be
abstract objects of some sort, e.g., ordered sets of
 propositions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Which of these platonistic views is superior can be settled by
determining which (if either) captures the correct interpretation of
sentences like [G]&mdash;i.e., by determining whether ordinary people
who utter sentences like [G] are best interpreted as talking about
stories or fictional characters.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that some people who take fictional characters to
be abstract objects (e.g., Thomasson 1999) would actually agree with
the idea that [G] should be read in the above way&mdash;i.e., as a
claim about the Sherlock Holmes stories and not about Sherlock Holmes
himself. Thomasson&rsquo;s main argument for believing in fictional
characters is based not on sentences like [G] but rather on sentences
like the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="senH">[H]</dt>
<dd> Some 19th century heroines are better developed than any 18th
century heroines.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It&rsquo;s hard to see how to paraphrase this as being about a story,
or even a bunch of stories. But, of course, one could still endorse a
fictionalist (i.e., an error-theoretic) view of sentences like
 <a href="#senH">[H]</a>.
 In other words, one could admit that [H] is a claim about fictional
characters and then one could claim that since there are no such
things as fictional characters, [H] is simply not true, although of
course it might be <em>true-in-the-story-of-fictional-characters</em>,
or <em>for-all-practical-purposes true</em>, where this just means
that it would have been true if there had been a realm of fictional
characters of the sort that platonists believe in. (Brock [2002]
endorses a fictionalist view of fictional characters that&rsquo;s
similar in spirit to the view alluded to here.)</p>

<h2 id="EpisArguAgaiPlat">5. The Epistemological Argument Against Platonism</h2>

<p>
In this section, we will consider what is widely considered the
strongest argument against platonism, namely, the
<em>epistemological</em> argument.</p>

<p>
(Before discussing the epistemological argument, it&rsquo;s worth
noting that there are many other important arguments against
platonism. Perhaps most obviously, there is an argument against
platonism based on Ockham&rsquo;s razor&mdash;an argument that goes
back to William of Ockham himself. In the second half of the twentieth
century, the multiple-reductions argument developed by Benacerraf
[1965] received a lot of attention. And
even more recently, anti-platonist arguments have been developed by
Builes [2022], Himelright [2023b], and Goodman [2024].)</p>

<p>
The epistemological argument goes all the way back to Plato, but it
has received renewed interest since 1973, when Paul Benacerraf
presented a version of the argument. Most of the work on this problem
has taken place in the philosophy of mathematics, in connection with
the platonistic view of mathematical objects like numbers. We will
therefore discuss the argument in this context, but all of the issues
and arguments can be reproduced in connection with other kinds of
abstract objects. The argument can be put in the following way:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="senBs">
<dt id="senB1">[B1]</dt>
<dd> Human beings exist entirely within spacetime.</dd>
<dt id="senB2">[B2]</dt>
<dd> If there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then they do
not exist in spacetime. Therefore, it seems very plausible that:</dd>
<dt id="senB3">[B3]</dt>
<dd> If [B1] and [B2] are true, then if there exist any abstract
mathematical objects, then human beings could not attain knowledge of
them. Therefore,</dd>
<dt id="senB4">[B4]</dt>
<dd> If there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then human
beings could not attain knowledge of them. Therefore,</dd>
<dt id="senB5">[B5]</dt>
<dd> If mathematical platonism is true, then human beings could not
attain mathematical knowledge. But</dd>
<dt id="senB6">[B6]</dt>
<dd> Human beings have mathematical knowledge. Therefore,</dd>
<dt id="senB7">[B7]</dt>
<dd> Mathematical platonism is not true.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(Before discussing possible responses to the argument, it&rsquo;s
worth noting that there&rsquo;s a sizable literature on how exactly
the epistemological argument should be formulated. Field [1989]
famously articulated the argument as a challenge to explain <em>the
reliability of our mathematical beliefs</em>. Donaldson [2014] argues
that Field&rsquo;s version of the argument shouldn&rsquo;t be
understood in terms of our mathematical beliefs counterfactually
depending on the mathematical facts. Benacerraf&rsquo;s original
version of the argument relied on a causal theory of knowledge; that
reliance has been almost universally rejected; but Nutting [2016]
provides a causal version of the epistemological argument that
doesn&rsquo;t rely on a causal theory of knowledge. Finally, worries
about the epistemological argument are raised by Linnebo [2006] and
Clarke-Doane [2016, 2020a], and a response is given in Berry
2020.)</p>

<p>
There seem to be only three ways for platonists to respond to this
argument&mdash;they have to reject
 <a href="#senB1">[B1]</a>,
 <a href="#senB2">[B2]</a>, or
 <a href="#senB3">[B3]</a>.
 For there is no reasonable way for them to reject&mdash;and they
presumably wouldn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to
 reject&mdash;<a href="#senB6">[B6]</a>
 or any of the three inferences in the argument. Also, it&rsquo;s not
enough for platonists to simply reject one of these three premises and
leave it at that. The epistemological argument is best thought of as a
challenge to explain how we humans could acquire knowledge of abstract
objects; and it seems that a satisfying response to the argument would
have to deliver such an explanation.</p>

<p>
The first way for platonists to respond to the epistemological
argument is to reject
 <a href="#senB1">[B1]</a>
 and to argue that the human mind is capable of somehow forging
contact with abstract mathematical objects and thereby acquiring
information about such objects. This strategy has been pursued by
Plato in <em>The Meno</em> and <em>The Phaedo</em>, and by G&ouml;del
(1947). Plato&rsquo;s idea is that our immaterial souls acquired
knowledge of abstract objects before we were born and that
mathematical learning is really just a process of coming to remember
what we knew before we were born. On G&ouml;del&rsquo;s version of the
view, we acquire knowledge of abstract objects in much the same way
that we acquire knowledge of concrete physical objects; more
specifically, just as we acquire information about physical objects
via the faculty of sense perception, so we acquire information about
abstract objects by means of a faculty of <em>mathematical
intuition</em>. Now, other philosophers have endorsed the idea that we
possess a faculty of mathematical intuition, but G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
version of this view&mdash;and he seems to be alone in
this&mdash;involves the idea that the mind is non-physical in some
sense and that we are capable of forging contact with, and acquiring
information from, non-physical mathematical
 objects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 This view has been almost universally rejected. One problem is that
denying [B1] doesn&rsquo;t seem to help. The idea of an immaterial
mind receiving information from an abstract object seems just as
mysterious and confused as the idea of a physical brain receiving
information from an abstract object.</p>

<p>
The second strategy that platonists can pursue in responding to the
epistemological argument is to argue that
 <a href="#senB2">[B2]</a>
 is false and that human beings can acquire information about
mathematical objects via normal perceptual means. The early Maddy
(1990) pursued this idea in connection with set theory, claiming that
sets of physical objects can be taken to exist in spacetime and,
hence, that we can perceive them. For instance, on her view, if there
are two books on a table, then the set containing these books exists
on the table, in the same place that the books exist, and we can see
the set and acquire information about it in this way. This view has
been subjected to much criticism, including arguments from the later
Maddy (1997). Others to attack the view include Lavine (1992),
Dieterle and Shapiro (1993), Milne (1994), Riskin (1994), and Carson
(1996).</p>

<p>
It may be objected that according to the definitions we&rsquo;ve been
using, views like Maddy&rsquo;s are not versions of platonism at all,
because they do not take mathematical objects to exist outside of
spacetime. Nonetheless, there is some rationale for thinking of
Maddy&rsquo;s view as a sort of non-traditional platonism. For since
Maddy&rsquo;s view entails that there is an infinity of sets
associated with every ordinary physical object, all sharing the same
spatiotemporal location and the same physical matter, she has to allow
that these sets differ from one another in some sort of non-physical
way and, hence, that there is something about these sets that is
non-physical, or perhaps abstract, in some sense of these terms. Now,
of course, the question of whether Maddy&rsquo;s view counts as a
version of <em>platonism</em> is purely terminological; but whatever
we say about this, the view is still worth considering in the present
context, because it is widely thought of as one of the available
responses to the epistemological argument against platonism, and
indeed, that is the spirit in which Maddy originally presented the
view.</p>

<p>
The third and final strategy that platonists can pursue is to reject
 <a href="#senB3">[B3]</a>.
 This has been the most popular strategy among contemporary
platonists. Its advocates include Quine (1951: &sect;6), Steiner
(1975: chapter 4), C. Parsons (1980, 1994), Katz (1981, 1998), Resnik
(1982, 1997), Wright (1983), Lewis (1986: &sect;2.4), Hale (1987),
Shapiro (1989, 1997), Burgess (1990), Balaguer (1995), Linsky and
Zalta (1995), Burgess and Rosen (1997), and Linnebo (2006).</p>

<p>
The strategy of rejecting
 <a href="#senB3">[B3]</a>
 presumably goes hand-in-hand with an assumption that
 <a href="#senB1">[B1]</a>
 and
 <a href="#senB2">[B2]</a>
 are true&mdash;and, hence, that mathematical objects (if there are
such things) are totally inaccessible to us and that information
cannot pass from mathematical objects to human beings. So the idea
behind this third strategy is to grant that human beings do not have
any information-transferring contact with abstract objects, and to
attempt to explain how human beings could nonetheless acquire
knowledge of such objects. Now, platonists might try to
claim&mdash;and Collard (2007)
<em>does</em> claim&mdash;that even if [B1] and [B2] are true, there
could still be an information-transferring contact between abstract
objects and human beings, because it could be that abstract objects
are not causally inert. But in order for this response to be at all
satisfying, it would need to come with an explanation of <em>how</em>
abstract objects could cause us to believe things, and no one has ever
come close to giving such an explanation.</p>

<p>
(Bengson [2015] has proposed a view according to which our
mathematical intuitions are <em>constituted</em> by the abstract
objects that they&rsquo;re about. It&rsquo;s not clear whether he
thinks that this involves an information transfer between abstract
objects and human beings, but either way, this view seems to be
undermined by the fact that we don&rsquo;t have any explanation of
<em>how it could be</em> that our intuitions are constituted by
abstract objects in a way that makes it the case that our intuitions
are reliable indicators of the facts about the relevant abstract
objects.)</p>

<p>
In any event, most of the philosophers who have rejected
 <a href="#senB3">[B3]</a>
 have been happy to grant that human beings do not have any
information-transferring contact with such objects; their aim has been
to explain how we could acquire knowledge of abstract objects without
the aid of any such contact. We will briefly consider the most
prominent of these attempted explanations.</p>

<p>
One version of the reject-[B3] strategy, implicit in the writings of
Quine (1951: &sect;6) and developed by Steiner (1975: chapter four,
especially section IV) and Resnik (1997: chapter 7), is to argue that
we have good reason to believe that our mathematical theories are
true, even though we don&rsquo;t have any contact with mathematical
objects, because </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li> these theories are embedded in our empirical theories, and </li>

<li> these empirical theories (including their mathematical parts)
have been confirmed by empirical evidence, and so </li>

<li> we have empirical evidence for believing that our mathematical
theories are true and, hence, that abstract mathematical objects
exist.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Notice that this view involves the controversial thesis that
<em>confirmation is holistic</em>, i.e., that entire theories are
confirmed by pieces of evidence that seem to confirm only parts of
theories. One might doubt that confirmation is holistic in this way
(see, e.g., Sober 1993, Maddy 1992, and Balaguer 1998a). Moreover,
even if one grants that confirmation is holistic, one might worry that
this view leaves unexplained the fact that mathematicians are capable
of acquiring knowledge of their theories before these theories are
applied in empirical science.</p>

<p>
A second version of the reject-[B3] strategy, developed by Katz (1981,
1998) and Lewis (1986: &sect;2.4), is to argue that we can know that
our mathematical theories are true, without any sort of
information-transferring contact with mathematical objects, because
these theories are <em>necessarily</em> true. The reason we need
information-transferring contact with ordinary physical objects in
order to know what they&rsquo;re like is that these objects could have
been different. For instance, we have to look at fire engines in order
to know that they&rsquo;re red, because they could have been blue. But
we don&rsquo;t need any contact with the number 4 in order to know
that it is the sum of 3 and 1, because it is necessarily the sum of 3
and 1. (For criticisms of this view, see Field [1989: 233&ndash;38]
and Balaguer [1998a: chapter 2, section 6.4].)</p>

<p>
A third version of the reject-[B3] strategy has been developed by
Resnik (1997) and Shapiro (1997). Both of these philosophers endorse
(platonistic) <em>structuralism</em>, a view that holds that our
mathematical theories provide true descriptions of mathematical
structures, which, according to this view, are abstract. Moreover,
Resnik and Shapiro both claim that human beings can acquire knowledge
of mathematical structures (without coming into any sort of
information-transferring contact with such things) by simply
constructing mathematical axiom systems; for, they argue, axiom
systems provide <em>implicit definitions</em> of structures. One
problem with this view, however, is that it does not explain how we
could know which of the various axiom systems that we might formulate
actually pick out structures that exist in the mathematical realm.</p>

<p>
A fourth and final version of the reject-[B3] strategy, developed
independently (and somewhat differently) by Balaguer (1995, 1998a) and
Linsky &amp; Zalta (1995), is based on the adoption of a particular
version of platonism called <em>plenitudinous platonism</em> (Balaguer
also calls it <em>full-blooded platonism</em>, or FBP, and Linsky and
Zalta call it <em>principled platonism</em>). Balaguer defines
plenitudinous platonism (somewhat roughly) as the view that there
exist mathematical objects of all possible kinds, or the view that all
the mathematical objects that possibly could exist actually do exist.
But, in general, Balaguer would define a different plenitude principle
for every different kind of abstract object. Linsky &amp; Zalta
develop plenitudinous platonism by proposing a distinctive plenitude
principle for each of three basic domains of abstracta: abstract
individuals, relations (properties and propositions), and contingently
nonconcrete individuals (1995: 554). For example, on their view, the
plenitude principle for abstract individuals asserts (again, somewhat
roughly) that every possible description of an object characterizes an
abstract object that encodes&mdash;and, thus, in an important sense,
<em>has</em>&mdash;the properties expressed in the description.</p>

<p>
Balaguer and Linsky &amp; Zalta then argue that if platonists endorse
plenitudinous platonism, they can solve the epistemological problem
with platonism without positing any sort of information-transferring
contact between human beings and abstract objects. Balaguer&rsquo;s
version of the argument proceeds as follows. Since plenitudinous
platonism, or FBP, says that there are mathematical objects of all
possible kinds, it follows that if FBP is true, then every purely
mathematical theory that could possibly be true (i.e., that&rsquo;s
internally consistent) accurately describes some collection of
actually existing mathematical objects. Thus, it follows from FBP that
in order to attain knowledge of abstract mathematical objects, all we
have to do is come up with an internally consistent purely
mathematical theory (and know that it is consistent). But it seems
clear that (i) we humans <em>are</em> capable of formulating
internally consistent mathematical theories (and of knowing that they
are internally consistent), and (ii) being able to do this does not
require us to have any sort of information-transferring contact with
the abstract objects that the theories in question are
 about.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Thus, if this is right, then the epistemological problem with
platonism has been solved.</p>

<p>
One might object here that in order for humans to acquire knowledge of
abstract objects in this way, they would first need to know that
plenitudinous platonism is true. Linsky &amp; Zalta respond to this by
arguing that plenitudinous platonism (or in their lingo, principled
platonism) is knowable <em>a priori</em> because it is required for
our understanding of any possible scientific theory: it alone is
capable of accounting for the mathematics that could be used in
empirical science no matter what the physical world was like.
Balaguer&rsquo;s response, on the other hand, is based on the claim
that to demand that platonists explain how humans could know that FBP
is true is exactly analogous to demanding that external-world realists
(i.e., those who believe that there is a real physical world, existing
independently of us and our thinking) explain how human beings could
know that there is an external world of a kind that gives rise to
accurate sense perceptions. Thus, Balaguer argues that while there may
be some sort of Cartesian-style skeptical argument against FBP here
(analogous to skeptical arguments against external-world realism), the
argument in
 <a href="#senBs">[B1]&ndash;[B7]</a>
 is supposed to be a different kind of argument, and in order to
respond to that argument, FBP-ists do not have to explain how humans
could know that FBP is
 true.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The FBP-based response to the epistemological argument has probably
been the most widely accepted response in the literature. But some
pushback against this response has been given by McSweeney (2020) and
Clarke-Doane (2020b).</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
