<h1>Japanese Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Apr 5, 2019; substantive revision Sun Jan 11, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Japanese philosophers have historically interacted with a multitude of
philosophies outside their native boundaries&mdash;most prominently
Chinese, Indian, Korean, and Western. As a result. they have been
attuned to the intimate relations among culture, ways of thinking, and
philosophical world views. An island chain twice as distant from its
continental neighbors as Britain is to its own, Japan escaped
successful foreign invasion until 1945. Accordingly, it largely
negotiated its own cultural, including philosophical, development
without an alien power forcibly imposing on the archipelago its own
religious world view or philosophical theories.</p>

<p>
Free of foreign coercion, Japanese thinkers had alternatives outside
the simple binary of wholehearted acceptance or utter rejection. New
theories from abroad could be tried and, if need be, experimentally
modified before making a final decision about endorsement. Because of
those circumstances, Japanese philosophers became skillful in
analyzing the cultural assumptions behind foreign ideas before
adopting, adapting, or rejecting them for their own culture.</p>

<p>
Against that backdrop, this article explains Japanese philosophy in
five sections. Section 1 considers how Japanese have traditionally
understood philosophy to be a Way (<em>michi</em>) of engaging reality
rather than a detached method for studying it. The next section lists
some patterns of analysis that are hallmarks of that Way. Section 3
identifies five distinguishable traditions having had a major impact
on Japanese philosophy, explaining a few central ideas from each.
Section 4 surveys how those five traditions have developed and
interacted over four major periods of Japanese history from ancient
times to the present. Section 5 concludes with a few themes given
special emphasis in Japanese philosophy that might be provocative to
philosophy at large, including those emphasized in recent scholarship
on Japanese philosophy in a comparative context.</p>

<h2 id="PhiEngKno">1. Philosophy as Engaged Knowing</h2>

<p>
The Japanese philosopher is more likely to understand reality by
working within it rather than by standing apart from it. In other
words, it more often involves personal engagement than impersonal
detachment. That difference in emphasis between traditional Japanese
philosophy and modern Western philosophy became clear to the Japanese
when the latter was first introduced into their country in full force
in the mid-nineteenth century. A crucial question was how to identify
in Japanese what the Westerners called <em>philosophy</em>. Hoping to
assimilate Western philosophy along with other aspects of Western
culture, the intellectuals behind Japan&rsquo;s modernization wanted
to give the field its own Japanese name, rather than treating it as a
foreign term pronounced phonetically.</p>

<p>
To capture the philosophical sense of <em>wisdom</em>
(-<em>sophy</em>), they picked a likely candidate from the classical
East Asian tradition, namely, <em>tetsu</em>. More provocative,
though, was their choice for the second part of the neologism, namely,
<em>gaku</em>. That word also had a classical pedigree: it signified
<em>learning</em>, especially in the sense of modeling oneself after a
textual or human model (that is, a master text or a personal master).
Probably more significantly, though, the term <em>gaku</em> at the
time was prominent in neologisms for disciplines in the newly
established Western-style universities, functioning as an equivalent
for the German <em>Wissenschaft</em>. Hence, it rendered the English
-<em>ology</em> suffix of fields like biology or geology as well as
the humanistic &ldquo;sciences&rdquo; (<em>Wissenschaften</em>) like
history or literary studies. By this protocol of nomenclature, the
Western discipline of <em>philosophy</em> came to be known in Japan by
the compound word <em>tetsugaku</em> and academic philosophers were
(and still are) called <em>tetsugakusha</em>, that is, &ldquo;scholars
who specialize in the <em>Wissenschaft</em> of wisdom&rdquo; or
&ldquo;wisdomologists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The salient point is that the label chosen was not a more traditional
term like <em>tetsujin</em>, &ldquo;wise people,&rdquo; a word more
closely approximating the original Greek meaning of the philosopher as
a &ldquo;lover of wisdom.&rdquo; So, we might say <em>tetsujin</em>
better refers to the premodern Japanese sense of the philosopher, that
is, a sage who has mastery in one of the traditional <em>Ways</em> of
wisdom (<em>d&#333;</em> or <em>michi</em>) such as the Way of the
buddhas, the Way of the Confucian scholarly sages, the Way of the
(Shint&#333;) <em>kami</em>, or even one of the Ways of the
traditional arts such as calligraphy, tea ceremony, pottery, painting,
flower arranging, or any of the various martial arts. (Traditional
Japan used a variety of terms for the sagely master; for convenience
in this article <em>tetsujin</em> will appear throughout.)</p>

<p>
In effect, by creating the new term <em>tetsugakusha</em> instead of
drawing on an already existing term from their own tradition, the
Japanese were distinguishing two species of understanding and two
forms of philosophizing. One species of knowers aspires to a scholarly
(&ldquo;scientific&rdquo;) detachment that mutes personal affect with
the aim of reflecting external affairs as they exist independently of
human ideation. That kind of understanding is the goal of the
<em>Wissenschaften</em>&mdash;the empirical sciences, literary
criticism, studies of history, and social sciences&mdash;that define
most departments in the academy alongside philosophy.</p>

<p>
The other species of understanding typifies those who personally
engage reality, transforming themselves and reality together into a
coherent and harmonious whole. That more traditional Japanese sense of
understanding transcends mere skill or know-how. To be a Confucian
sage or a master calligrapher is not simply to be proficient in
technique (any more than being a logician in the West is simply
knowing how to construct a syllogism). Although rigorously disciplined
in their early training, the members of the engaged knowing family of
philosophers eventually go beyond fixed templates and regimens to
respond creatively to what-is.</p>

<p>
When engaged understanding prevails, the knower and known collaborate
in an act of innovation rather than simple discovery. From the
Japanese standpoint, in their praxis as philosophers, the
<em>tetsugakusha</em> are akin to how geologists understand clay,
whereas the <em>tetsujin</em> are more akin to how master potters
understand clay. The geologist acquires scientific knowledge (geology)
to forge an external relation between the knower and the clay, each of
which preexists the knowledge and basically remains unchanged by the
knowledge (a <em>Wissenschaft</em> is typically grounded in the
descriptive). By contrast, the knowledge of the potter is expressed
in, by, and with the clay as an interactive project (the masterwork of
pottery). Both the clay and the &ldquo;bodymind&rdquo; of the potter
are transformed in the act of engaged wisdom.</p>

<p>
For the <em>tetsugakusha,</em> philosophy creates a link between the
self and the independently existing world; for the <em>tetsujin,</em>
philosophy arises from the mutual engagement between self and world,
transforming both in the process. The distinction parallels what Henri
Bergson characterized in the opening pages of <em>Introduction to
Metaphysics</em> as two ways of knowing: &ldquo;moving around&rdquo;
an object as contrasted with &ldquo;entering it&rdquo; (Bergson 1955,
21).</p>

<h2 id="HalJapPhiAna">2. Hallmarks of Japanese Philosophical Analysis</h2>

<h3 id="IntRel">2.1 Internal Relations</h3>

<p>
When Japanese thinkers assume two items are related (whatever the
items be: physical entities, ideas, persons, social structures, etc.),
they usually begin by examining how the items internally overlap (how
they <em>inter</em>relate) rather than by looking for something
additional (a third item, whether it be another thing, idea, force, or
whatever) that externally <em>connects</em> or <em>bonds</em> them.
The simple diagrams below indicate the chief difference.</p>

<div class="figures wid85 pad-small avoid-break">

<div class="inner-fig">
<img src="fig1.png" height="130" width="190" alt="two disjoint circles labeled &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo; connected by a relation &lsquo;R&rsquo; external to both" />

<div class="inner-fig">
<img src="fig2.png" height="130" width="216" alt="two intersecting circles labeled &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo; with the intersection labeled &lsquo;R&rsquo;" />

<p class="center">
Figure 2: Internal Relation</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Figure 1 shows <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> as discrete entities in an
external relation represented by the extrinsic linking agency of
<em>R</em>. Figure 2, by contrast, shows <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> as
internally related entities such that <em>R</em> denotes what they
share, what intrinsically conjoins them. In the case of the external
relation, if the relation dissolves (or is omitted from the analysis),
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> each retains its own integrity without loss.
Only the context of their connection disappears. In the case of an
internal relation, on the other hand, if the relation dissolves (or is
omitted from the analysis), <em>a</em> loses part of itself, as does
<em>b</em>.</p>

<p>
For instance, as a legal arrangement, marriage is an external,
contractual relation into which two individuals enter. Should that
arrangement end, each of the pair returns to his or her originally
discrete individuality and attendant rights. As a loving arrangement,
however, marriage is an internal relation in which two people each
share part of themselves. Should the love connection dissolve, each
person loses part of what one had formerly been, the part that had
been invested in the other. As Emily Dickinson (1884) wrote after
losing a beloved friend, she became a &ldquo;crescent&rdquo; of her
former self. (See the entry on
 <a href="../relations/">relations</a>
 for further discussion of the external/internal distinction.)</p>

<p>
When Japanese philosophers emphasize engaged over detached knowing,
their treatment of standard philosophical themes assumes distinctive
nuances. One example will illustrate. (For a detailed discussion of
the cultural and philosophical ramifications in emphasizing one kind
of relation over the other, see Kasulis 2002.) Because of its roots in
praxis, Japanese philosophy approaches mind-body issues differently
from how they have typically been addressed in the West, especially
the modern West. As the postwar philosopher, Yuasa Yasuo
(1925&ndash;2005) analyzed in detail (Yuasa 1987), the preference in
modern Western philosophy has been to think about the mind and body as
discrete (that is, as external to each other) and the issue then
becomes <em>what</em> connects the two. If no third external
connection can be found, the only obvious alternative is to eliminate
the dualism by reducing one of the polarities to the other, for
example, by making the mind an epiphenomenon of the body. Yuasa found
such formulations of the mind-body problem alien to the Japanese
philosophical tradition, both ancient and modern.</p>

<p>
Japanese philosophers have customarily taken the view that the body
and mind may be distinguished, but they have assumed from the outset
that their relation is internal rather than external. Suppose we
envision body and mind as a single complex of two intersecting circles
(call it <em>bodymind</em> to capture the sense of the Japanese
compound term <em>shinjin</em>). Then without the somatic conjunction,
the mind is not fully the mind and without the mental conjunction, the
body is not fully the body. Accordingly, Yuasa argued, Japanese
philosophers have throughout history typically searched not for
<em>what</em> constant connects the discrete mind and discrete body,
but instead, <em>how</em> the bodymind functions such that the
interrelationship between the somatic and mental aspects may increase.
Generally, the greater the overlap between the aspects, the more
optimally the holistic bodymind functions.</p>

<p>
In learning to play the piano, for example, Yuasa says the novice
begins by having &ldquo;the mind lead the body&rdquo; to memorize the
keys, but as the pianist becomes proficient, &ldquo;the body leads the
mind&rdquo; so that it seems the &ldquo;fingers know where the keys
are&rdquo; without the intrusion of conscious thinking. The mind can
then concentrate more fully on the music itself. As the two circles
more fully merge, the music, the mind, and the fingers touching the
keyboard become a single act. That pathway to increasing bodymind
unity explains how praxis and discipline are prerequisite to attaining
creativity and fully free expression.</p>

<p>
Yuasa also demonstrated how that integrative bodymind phenomenon has
been recognized in various Western as well as Eastern theories
including neuropsychology, the study of the conditioned response
system, psychosomatic medicine, depth psychology, phenomenologies of
the body, Indian Ayurvedic medicine, kundalini yogic praxis, Japanese
theories of artistry, and East Asian models of <em>ki</em>
(<em>qi</em> in Chinese) within both medicine and the martial arts. In
short: Yuasa&rsquo;s philosophy exemplifies how contemporary Japanese
thinkers may constructively engage Western thought while drawing on
strands of their own premodern traditions. For other examples of how
Japanese philosophy may suggest new perspectives on Western
philosophical issues, see Section 5 below.</p>

<h3 id="HolRelBetWhoPar">2.2 Holographic Relation between Whole and Part</h3>

<p>
Models of reality built on external relations often resemble a mosaic
in which individual entities are like tiles whose meaning in relation
to the whole can only be determined by applying an extrinsic blueprint
or template representing the external relations linking them. Each
individual tile gives little or no information about how it relates to
other tiles. By contrast, models of reality built on internal
relations are typically more like jigsaw puzzles in which we discover
the relation of one piece to another by looking more closely at the
information already within each individual piece: its protuberances,
indentations, and coloration. Each piece has within it the information
about how it links with its adjacent pieces.</p>

<p>
In some instances, the configuration within the internal relation is
even more revealing such that each piece has information not only
about adjacent pieces, but also about <em>all</em> the other pieces in
the whole. That paradigm can be called <em>holographic</em> in the
etymological sense that the whole (<em>holo</em>-) is found to be
inscribed (<em>-graph</em>) in each of its parts. The whole is not
simply made of its parts, but also, each part contains the pattern or
configuration of the whole of which it is a part. Such holographic
relations between whole and part are common in Japanese philosophical
systems.</p>

<p>
In the West, the holographic paradigm permeated animistic cultures
tracing back to prehistoric times. It persisted in the later magical
arts wherein a fingernail or hair could give a wizard or witch power
over the whole person from which the part was pilfered. It continued
in the cult of relics throughout the Middle Ages. But the
Enlightenment&rsquo;s rationalism stripped the holographic paradigm of
its ontological connections, restricting it to being no more than a
figure of speech (such as a metonym) or other form of conventionalized
symbol such as William Blake&rsquo;s universe in a grain of sand or a
fractured image in a psychoanalytic dream analysis.</p>

<p>
More recently, however, in a scientific world increasingly attracted
to models of recursiveness, fractals, the multiple expressions of stem
cells, and so forth, the holographic paradigm has once again begun to
assume ontological and not just figurative relevance in the West. To a
forensic scientist, a drop of blood or a single hair from a crime
scene is not only part of a person&rsquo;s anatomy, but is also an
item inscribed with the dna pattern of the person&rsquo;s entire
anatomy. In the history of Japanese thought, by contrast, the
holographical paradigm of the whole-inscribed-in-each-of-its-parts
never went out of philosophical fashion as having potentially
ontological significance and often figures prominently in many
Japanese philosophical theories. Two examples will help clarify: the
imperialist concept of <em>kokutai</em> and the aesthetic value of
minimalism.</p>

<p>
The holographic relation applies to the theory of the Japanese
imperialist state. Every Japanese is a member of the imperial state
and, as a holographic part, contains a pattern for the whole.
Originally established through history, myth, and ritual, the role of
the emperor is ideologically represented as <em>kokutai</em>
(<em>koku</em>: the country, nation, or its people; <em>tai</em>:
body, formation, essence). The term refers equally to the emperor and
the Japanese nation because the emperor is quintessentially a part of
the state that embodies the pattern of the whole state including every
Japanese person and the land of Japan itself. Such a holographic
explanation of imperialist philosophy is more authentic to the
Japanese way of thinking than Western interpretations of the emperor
as &ldquo;god&rdquo; or, more recently, as an ideologically
manipulated metonym for the state (e.g., as in Harootunian 1984).</p>

<p>
The stress on holographic relations also helps explain the so-called
Japanese aesthetic of minimalism. The assumption that the part
contains the pattern of the whole sheds light on the sparseness of the
ink painting, the brevity of the haiku, the silences between the
musical notes, or the stillness between the movements of the Noh
actor. All such artistic expressions focus on a particular to open the
audience or spectator to the pattern of the holographic whole. What at
first may seem a technique of exclusion or omission turns out to be
the most all-inclusive expressive technique of all.</p>

<h3 id="ForAss">2.3 Forms of Assimilation</h3>

<p>
One response to encountering an opposing philosophical position or
theory, a response common in the Western tradition from the time of
the ancient Sophists, is to reaffirm one&rsquo;s own position by
refuting the other, revealing its inconsistencies or weaknesses. (This
adversarial form of argumentation, including its rarefied form known
as the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, is common in Indian philosophy
as well and was introduced to Japan via Buddhism more than a
millennium prior to any Western influence.) In Japan, though, a more
common response to philosophical opposition has been to reaffirm
one&rsquo;s original view by assimilating into it what is central in
the opposing viewpoint through a process of allocation, relegation, or
hybridization. Very often in Japanese philosophical debates, the
contenders compete in trying to absorb rather than refute the
opposition. Cultural comparatists have noted that the Western game of
chess is won by attacking the opponent&rsquo;s pieces and capturing
the king, whereas the Japanese game of <em>go</em> is won by
encircling the opponent&rsquo;s stones until all are captured and none
remain. To the surprise of the uninitiated Western philosophical
reader, therefore, the skilled use of agreement and concession, rather
than direct attack, may sometimes be the sharpest tools in the
Japanese philosopher&rsquo;s argumentative arsenal. It is important,
therefore, to notice how allocation, relegation, and hybridization can
help a philosophical theory gain dominance in the Japanese milieu.</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Allocation</h4>

<p>
Allocation is the most compromising form of philosophical
assimilation. Two opposing views are accepted without major
alteration, but conflict is avoided by restricting each to its own
clearly defined disjunctive domain. A d&eacute;tente is negotiated
such that each philosophy can function without opposition within its
own discrete set of philosophical problems as long as it refrains from
universal claims that its methods, assumptions, and conclusions apply
to every possible kind of philosophical enterprise. For example, at
times Japanese Confucian, Buddhist, and Shint&#333; philosophies
resolved potential conflicts by allocating social and political issues
to Confucianism, psychological and epistemological theories to
Buddhism, and naturalistic emotivism to Shint&#333;. The
<em>Seventeen-article Constitution</em> of Prince Sh&#333;toku in the
early seventh century displays such assimilation (see Section 4.1
below.)</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Relegation</h4>

<p>
Relegation assimilates an opposing view by conceding its truth even
while subordinating it to being only a partial component of the
original, now more inclusive, position. The rhetoric is usually that
the apparently opposing view is not really something new at all, but
has been a previously under-emphasized part of the original theory. As
in allocation, the position of the other is fully accepted but, in
this case, only as an incomplete part of the already held theory. Of
course, the rhetoric aside, a close analysis often reveals that the
original theory actually expands its comprehensiveness to incorporate
the competing one, but the result is the same: the rival ideas are
assimilated by being relegated to a subordinated place within the
whole, thereby losing their force as an independent theory that can
oppose the winning position.</p>

<p>
For example, Japanese esoteric Buddhism assimilated proto-Shint&#333;
ideas, values, and practices by relegating Shint&#333; <em>kami</em>
to being &ldquo;surface manifestations&rdquo; of Buddhist reality. By
that process, Shint&#333; cosmology and rituals could be assimilated
without change. Yet, that could happen only as long as their
Shint&#333; significance was considered a superficial understanding of
deeper Buddhist metaphysical truths.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Hybridization</h4>

<p>
Hybridization is a third form of assimilation that leaves neither the
original theory nor its opposing rival theory intact. Instead, through
their cross-pollination something completely new is born. A hybrid
presents us with a new species of philosophy. Although we can do a
genealogy of its parentage, it cannot (unlike the cases of allocation
or relegation) ever return to its earlier opposing forms. If we
consider a biological hybrid like a boysenberry, which has a genetic
parentage traceable to a loganberry and a raspberry, we cannot find
the loganberry or the raspberry intact in the boysenberry. Once the
hybrid is created, we cannot undo the crossbreeding; there are now
three distinct species of berries.</p>

<p>
Analogously, in the process of philosophical assimilation, when true
philosophical hybrids emerge, historians of philosophy may be able to
reveal their genealogies, but the theories themselves can no longer be
deconstructed back into their parental origins. Japanese
<em>bushid&#333;</em>, the Way of the warrior, is such a philosophical
hybrid born of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shint&#333;. Yet, it became
an independent philosophy of its own that in many ways served as a
rival to its antecedents. (See Section 3.5 below.)</p>

<p>
Next let us examine how Japanese philosophers use those forms of
analysis in developing five originally distinct sources of
philosophical ideas.</p>

<h2 id="FivFouJapPhi">3. Five Fountainheads of Japanese Philosophy</h2>

<h3 id="Shi">3.1 Shint&#333;</h3>

<p>
Three major philosophical sources have fed into Japanese thought since
ancient times up through the present, two additional ones being added
in modern times (that is, post-1868). First has been Shint&#333;. In
its archaic form, especially before its contact with the literary
philosophical heritage of continental Asia, it is better termed
<em>proto-Shint&#333;</em> or even simply &ldquo;ancient <em>kami</em>
worship&rdquo; because it only loosely resembles what we now know as
Shint&#333;. Institutional Shint&#333; thought did not really begin
until the medieval period and today&rsquo;s Shint&#333; philosophy
mostly originates in the Native Japan Studies tradition beginning in
the eighteenth century. (See the entry on 
 <a href="../kokugaku-school/">The Kokugaku School</a>.)</p>

<p>
<em>Proto-Shint&#333;</em> lacked philosophical reflection and even
self-conscious articulation, but it can be so named because
today&rsquo;s Shint&#333; has often claimed (sometimes disingenuously)
a resonance with its main values, ritual forms, and world view. Dating
back to preliterate times, proto-Shint&#333; was more an amalgam of
beliefs and practices lending cohesion to early Japanese communities.
As such it largely resembled religions in ancient animistic and
shamanistic cultures found elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>
Specifically, the material and spiritual were internally related in a
continuous field wherein the human and the natural, both animate and
inanimate, were in an interactional, even communicative relation.
<em>Kami</em> (often too restrictively translated into English as
&ldquo;gods&rdquo;) manifested the power (<em>tama</em>) to inspire
awe. They could refer to anything ranging from a celestial deity to a
ghost to a possessed human being to a spirit within a natural object
to a wondrous natural object itself (such as Mt Fuji) to even a
special manufactured object such as a legendary sword. Although human
interactions with <em>kami</em> might be either beneficial or harmful,
there was no duality or conflict between good and evil forces. Even
within human affairs, wrongdoing was generally a violation or
transgression of a taboo, regardless of whether the acts were
accidental or intentional. Since criminality or sin was not a major
consideration, the proper response was not so much guilt, repentance,
or rehabilitation, but instead ritual purification. Spiritual and
political leadership shared a common charisma allowing the political
leader to serve sacerdotal roles in rituals that brought the community
benefits and warded off danger. The rituals, often shamanistic in
character, mediated the fluid boundaries between the heavens, this
world, and the underworld as well as the realms of the animate,
inanimate, human, and natural.</p>

<p>
Although, as far as we know, there was no self-reflective
philosophizing per se in the preliterate world of proto-Shint&#333;,
philosophical ideas introduced from abroad often took root most deeply
when they drew support from some of its basic ideas and values. For
example, proto-Shint&#333; animism generally assumed we live in a
world of internal relations where various forces and things can be
distinguished, but in the end, they are never discrete but inherently
interrelated. Indeed because of that reciprocity, one might say the
world is not simply what we engage, but also something that engages
us. As we define it, it also defines us.</p>

<p>
The ancient proto-Shint&#333; creation myths recount how many parts of
the physical world came into being through involuntary divine
parthenogenesis. For example, the sun and the moon&mdash;both the
physical objects and the celestial <em>kami</em> associated with
each&mdash;came into being as the effluent of Izanagi
<em>kami</em>&rsquo;s eyes when he purified himself in a river. This
type of genesis narrative supports an understanding that every part of
the physical world holographically reflects the pattern of spiritual
creativity on a cosmic level.</p>

<p>
In the final analysis, Shint&#333;&rsquo;s reality is not a world of
discrete things connected to each other, but more a field of which we
are part (a field often expressed by the indigenous word
<em>kokoro</em>). This connectedness applies to the word-reality
relation as well. <em>Koto</em> was a term for both <em>word</em> and
<em>thing</em> suggesting that words had the spiritual power
(<em>tama</em>) to evoke, and not simply refer to, a preexisting
reality. Thus, the term &ldquo;spirit of words&rdquo;
<em>kotodama</em> (<em>koto + tama</em>) suggested an onto-phonetic
resonance reflecting internal relations among language, sound, and
reality.</p>

<p>
Although many such characteristics of proto-Shint&#333; are found in
other archaic animistic cultures throughout the world, unlike in many
of those other locations, in Japan those ancient sensitivities were
not suppressed by rationalistic philosophies imposed from outside. For
example, Christianity's Greco-Roman philosophical analyses drove
underground many older animistic cultures (such as the Druids in the
British Isles). When the major philosophical traditions from
continental Asia entered Japan, by contrast, they did not take an
oppositional stance toward the world view already in place within the
archipelago. Therefore, much of proto-Shint&#333;&rsquo;s organicism,
vitalism, and the sensitivity to the field of inter-responsive,
internal, and holographic relations could survive within the
mainstream of Japanese thinking.</p>

<h3 id="Con">3.2 Confucianism</h3>

<p>
The impulse to philosophize in an organized fashion came to Japan in
waves from continental Asia: China, Korea, and indirectly India.
Previously illiterate, in the fifth century or so, the Japanese
started developing a writing system, using at first the Chinese
language for its base. Because Japanese and Chinese are linguistically
unrelated and differ both syntactically and phonetically, it took
centuries for a Japanese writing system to evolve out of the Chinese
sinographs, in the meantime making Chinese the <em>de facto</em>
written language. As such, Chinese philosophical works served as
textbooks for Japan&rsquo;s study centers, eventually transforming the
culture beyond the parameters envisioned by the proto-Shint&#333;
world view and forms of life.</p>

<p>
Of the three classical &ldquo;Ways&rdquo; of traditional Chinese
philosophy, namely, Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, only the
latter two achieved independent philosophical prominence in Japan.
Daoism contributed to the proto-Shint&#333; base a more sophisticated
understanding of the processes of natural change and a conceptual
vocabulary for creative, responsive engagement with reality through
agenda-less activity (what the Chinese Daoists called <em>wuwei</em>).
For the most part, however, its influence was most obvious in the
alchemical arts, prognostication, and as a resource for literary
allusions.</p>

<p>
Admittedly, in the medieval period some Daoist philosophical
references appear in the language of the arts, especially in theories
of creativity, but they occur mainly within a Zen Buddhist context.
That is likely because before coming to Japan, Chinese Zen (Chan) had
already assimilated many Daoist ideas. In contrast with Daoism,
however, Confucianism and Buddhism maintained a presence throughout
Japanese history as independent philosophical currents of philosophy.
Of the two, we consider Confucianism first. (See also the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-confucian/">Japanese Confucian Philosophy</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
As the second fountainhead of Japanese philosophy, Confucianism
entered the country as a literary tradition from China and Korea
beginning around the sixth and seventh centuries. By then it already
enjoyed a sophisticated continental philosophical heritage for well
over a millennium. Confucian philosophy in Japan changed little until
its second wave in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when it
experienced major transformations. It then became Japan&rsquo;s
dominant philosophical movement until the radical changes brought by
the modern period. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, that is, with
the overthrow of the shogunate and the return of imperial rule,
Confucianism receded somewhat in its philosophical dominance.
Philosophical focus turned to the rise of Western academic philosophy,
State Shint&#333; ideology, and the secularized version of
<em>bushid&#333;</em> (Way of the warrior) as promulgated in the
National Morality education program. That is not to say, however, that
Confucianism does not continue to remain influential in its emphasis
on scholarship, its definition of hierarchical social roles, its
attention to concrete patterns and laws of change, and its stress on
cultivating virtue.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 The Confucian Social and Moral Order</h4>

<p>
From the time of their introduction into Japan, Confucian political,
social, and ethical ideals quickly transformed the structure of
Japanese society. From the seventh century, texts traditionally
associated with Confucianism served as the core curriculum in the
imperial academy for the education of courtiers and bureaucratic
officials. Politically, Confucian ideology gave a sophisticated
justification for an imperial state. Like proto-Shint&#333;, it
recognized the charisma of the political ruler as both a chief ritual
priest and mediator with the celestial realm in addition to being the
pinnacle of political authority. But Confucianism added to the
Japanese context a rich description of political and social roles that
organized the society into a harmonious network of interdependent
offices and groups. Confucianism defined a place for each person,
including a set of shifting roles and contexts to be performed with
ritual decorum.</p>

<p>
So, the proto-Shint&#333; taboo structure was enhanced with a
Confucian set of socially appropriate behaviors. Once again, it was
not a matter of moral mandates about good vs. evil, however. Instead
it described role-based behaviors stressing rightness as contrasted
against inappropriateness or impropriety. That social vision
elaborated on and improved the proto-Shinto world view, enabling the
growth of a Japanese state that expanded beyond family and regional
clan regimes. Japan became a centralized imperial state spanning the
archipelago. Furthermore, as Japan became aware of the high cultural
achievements of its Korean and Chinese neighbors, it used Confucianism
to participate in the East Asian cultural sphere defined by China and
the prestige accompanying that membership.</p>

<p>
A striking exception to the standard Chinese Confucian political
philosophy was that the Japanese ignored the principle of the mandate
of heaven (<em>tianming</em> in Chinese) that was central to the
Chinese state ideology. In China, the authority of the emperor flowed
from a celestial entitlement or command, a mandate that could be
withdrawn if the emperor no longer acted in accord with the Way
(<em>dao</em>) or cosmic pattern (<em>tianli</em>). By contrast,
following their proto-Shint&#333; sensitivities, the Japanese
considered their emperor to be a direct descendant of the celestial
<em>kami,</em> eventually specifically of the sun <em>kami</em>,
Amaterasu. Like a blood connection, all Japanese and the <em>kami</em>
were, through the emperor, internally related with each other such
that their connections could not be nullified. The Shinto holographic
emphasis remained primary: the emperor was the part of Japan that
contained the template for the whole set of internal connections among
the kami, the Japanese people, and the physical land of Japan. No
external mandate was needed to justify imperial rule.</p>

<p>
For the most part, Confucianism brought to ancient Japan detailed
innovations about how to organize a harmonious hierarchical society in
which roles of respect directed to those above were reciprocated by
roles of care directed to those below. The analysis was that society
can be construed as constructed out of five binary relations:
ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, senior-junior, and
friend-friend. If people could enact those five relations with
ritualized propriety, attentive to fulfilling the roles they name (a
praxis called in Japanese <em>seimei</em> &ldquo;trueing up the
terms&rdquo; or &ldquo;the rectification of names&rdquo;), harmony
would prevail not only in those relations but in the whole society
constructed out of those relations.</p>

<p>
An implication of the Confucian view of role-based ideals is that the
sharp separation between the descriptive and the prescriptive
collapses. There is theoretically no gap between knowing what a parent
(or a ruler, or a husband &hellip;) <em>is</em> and the role that
person <em>should</em> perform. Thus, Confucianism can be understood
as a type of ethico-political utopianism, but it insists its basis is
neither speculation nor rationalistic theory, but fidelity to
historical paradigm. The prototype is found in the harmonious society
depicted in the ancient Chinese classics: the histories, the odes, and
the rites that inspired Confucius&rsquo;s insights. It follows that
the Way to become ethically and politically accomplished is to study
the classics and to model oneself after the ancient paradigms of the
roles exemplified by the sages of the past.</p>

<h3 id="Bud">3.3 Buddhism</h3>

<p>
The third major fountainhead feeding into Japanese philosophy from
ancient to contemporary times has been Buddhism. With origins in India
going back to the fifth century bce, Buddhism, like Confucianism,
entered Japan via Korea and China in the sixth and seventh centuries.
In contrast with Confucianism, however, by the end of the eighth
century, Buddhism became the major focus of Japanese creative
philosophical development as imported Chinese Buddhist schools of
thought were modified and new Japanese schools developed. Buddhism
continued its intellectual dominance until the seventeenth century,
then making way for the second wave of Confucian ideas that better
suited the newly risen urbanized, secular society under the control of
the Tokugawa shoguns. Meanwhile, Buddhist intellectuals tended to
focus more on institutional development, textual studies, and
sectarian histories.</p>

<p>
When Western philosophy surged into modern Japan and its newly
established secular universities, some influential Japanese
philosophers saw Buddhist ideas as the best premodern resource for
synthesis with Western thought. Yet, under the ideology of State
Shint&#333;, as both a religion and a philosophy Buddhism often
suffered persecution. Not until 1945 was it once again completely free
to develop its theories openly without government surveillance and
censorship.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Buddhism and the Self-World Interrelation</h4>

<p>
With a millennium of philosophical roots going back to India and
further cultivated in China and Korea, Buddhism brought to
proto-Shint&#333;&rsquo;s vague intuitions and inchoate belief systems
some sophisticated analyses and competing theories representing a
multitude of different schools of thought. In addition, it offered a
rich new vocabulary redolent with allusions to ideas and terms from
Sanskrit, Pali, and Chinese. There were, however, a few nearly
universally accepted Buddhist themes that resonated well with the
Japanese preliterate context and have continued to influence major
lines of Japanese thinking.</p>

<p>
First is the Buddhist claim that reality consists of a flow of
interdependent, conditioned events rather than independent,
substantially existent things. Nothing exists in and of itself and
there is no unchanging reality behind the world of flux. Thus, more
than a millennium after its origins in India, Buddhism came to Japan
with sophisticated analyses supporting a world view that was
essentially consistent with proto-Shint&#333;&rsquo;s unreflective
emphasis on internal relations, fluid boundaries, and a field of
shifting events rather than fixed things. For example, the Japanese
Kegon (Chinese: Huayan) school contributed a complex philosophy of
holographic interdependence that went far beyond the simply magical
modality it had been in the proto-Shint&#333; consciousness.</p>

<p>
A second fundamental Buddhist premise is that reality presents itself
without illusion in its so-called as-ness or thusness (<em>nyoze;</em>
Sanskrit: <em>tathat&#257;</em>). That contrasted with a widespread
orthodox Indian view of the Buddha&rsquo;s time (found in the
<em>Upani&#347;ads</em> and later <em>Vedas</em>, for example) that
reality continuously hides its true nature through illusion (Sanskrit:
<em>m&#257;y&#257;</em>). Buddhism agrees that we ordinarily seldom
access reality as it is, but that is not because of ontological
illusion. Rather, we project psychological delusions on to reality.
Those delusions are fueled by habituated stimulus-response systems
based in ignorance, repulsion, and desire. As a result, a major theme
in Buddhist philosophy is to understand the bodymind mechanisms of the
inner self or consciousness, to recognize how our emotions, ideas,
mental states, and even philosophical assumptions color our
perceptions of reality. The problem is not illusions within reality,
but the self-delusions we mistake for reality.</p>

<p>
Buddhism not only made the Japanese more aware of the inner dynamics
of experience, but also conveyed a collection of epistemological,
psychological, ethical, hermeneutic, and metaphysical bodymind
theories and practices aimed at understanding and eradicating those
self-generated delusions. Freed of delusions, our bodymind would be in
accord with the way things are. Then we could live without the anguish
created by trying to live in a concocted reality we desire instead of
reality as it is.</p>

<p>
A third general Buddhist contribution to Japanese thought since
ancient times is its theory of volitional action or karma
(<em>g&#333;</em>). Every volitional thought, word, or deed has an
impact on the bodymind system such that present actions lead to
propensities for future actions. Furthermore, karma is Janus-headed in
its causality such that those present actions are also in part
conditioned by previous volitional actions as well. The result is that
I affect my surrounding conditions even as those surrounding
conditions are affecting me. Thus, the Buddhist theory of karmic
action implies a field of interresponsive agency that is paradoxically
both individuated and systemic, both volitional and conditioned. That
paradigm has raised a number of issues and generated multiple theories
by Japanese Buddhist ethical and social philosophers through the
centuries.</p>

<h3 id="WesAcaPhi">3.4 Western Academic Philosophy</h3>

<p>
The fourth major source of Japanese philosophy, the first of the two
additional ones to enter modern (post-1868) Japan, has been the influx
of Western philosophy into the universities as <em>tetsugaku</em>. The
philosophy courses, like most other subjects of Western origin, were
initially taught by Westerners, mainly professors from Germany and the
United States who came to Japan to teach the discipline in their
native languages. To groom students to benefit from that instruction,
the government established a comprehensive system of preparatory
academies (&ldquo;higher schools&rdquo;) scattered throughout the
country in which the highly qualified were trained not only in the
basic academic disciplines of arts and sciences (both Western and East
Asian) but also in the Western languages required for university
instruction. After completing training in philosophy at the Imperial
University (Tokyo Imperial University was the first), the most
promising students often studied abroad in the West for further
training, after which time they could assume professorships back home.
Their philosophical education was truly global in scope.</p>

<h4>3.4.1 Western Academic Philosophy and Modernization</h4>

<p>
Although Roman Catholic Christian thought was introduced by
missionaries in the fifteenth century, it had a short-lived influence
of about a century before it was banned as part of the closure of
Japan to almost all foreign contact. Hence, the first strong and
lasting impact of Western philosophy did not come until the late
nineteenth century. Although its impact has been broad and difficult
to summarize, a few key points are especially noteworthy.</p>

<p>
First, in accord with Confucianism&rsquo;s stress on mastering classic
historical texts, it is not surprising that the Japanese philosophy
curriculum emphasized readings from the history of Western thought as
foundational. With Japan&rsquo;s new openness to Western ideas,
modernization, and the democracy promised in the Meiji Constitution of
1889, however, there was also initially an attraction to the liberal
political ideas of Rousseau and J. S. Mill, for example.</p>

<p>
Second, the stress on urgent technological and scientific development
as well as the chance to break free from the canonicity of
Confucianism (and to a lesser extent Buddhism) led to an almost
immediate interest in Comte&rsquo;s positivism and Mill&rsquo;s
utilitarianism. With the new emphasis on mathematics and science,
there was also an interest in the new (still
&ldquo;philosophical&rdquo;) field of experimental psychology
represented by Wilhelm Wundt and William James.</p>

<p>
In the long run, however, German philosophy, especially German
idealism had the most lasting and deep influence. This was partly a
fortuitous connection brought about by the close association formed in
the late nineteenth century between Tokyo Imperial University and
Germany. Not only were some key early foreign professors at Tokyo from
Germany, but also Germany became the favored location for sending
Japanese philosophy students for foreign study. In that context Kant,
even more than Plato or Descartes, was considered the key figure for
the founding of <em>tetsugaku.</em> He had settled the challenge of
Hume&rsquo;s skeptical stance toward science, saved us from scholastic
theological metaphysics by establishing critical philosophy and the
antinomies, as well as given direction&ndash;&ndash;either positive or
negative&mdash;to the development of Fichte&rsquo;s philosophical
anthropology, Hegel&rsquo;s dialectical thinking, Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
and Nietzsche&rsquo;s Will, Kierkegaard&rsquo;s subjectivism, and the
later school of neo-Kantianism. At least that became the mainstream
view among the majority of Japan&rsquo;s early twentieth-century
philosophers.</p>

<h3 id="BusWayWar">3.5 Bushid&#333; (The Way of the Warrior)</h3>

<p>
The fifth fountainhead of Japanese philosophy did not originate from
abroad but bubbled up from within Japan in the modern period:
<em>bushid&#333;,</em> the Way of the warrior. There were
locally-produced martial codes and edifying handbooks in Japan for
centuries preceding <em>the Meiji restoration. Yet,</em>
<em>bushid&#333;</em> was formalized only in the modern period as a
school of thought with a political, ethical, and ethnic ideology in
service to the entire nation.</p>

<p>
Loyalty was originally a generalized lower-order Confucian virtue, but
<em>bushid&#333;</em> gave it a special meaning by linking it directly
to the emperor and the holographic paradigm supporting the imperial
system in State Shint&#333;. The emphasis on self-sacrificial dying as
the fullest expression of loyalty seems to have been most foregrounded
in 1701 with the famous Ak&#333; Incident of the forty-seven
masterless samurai, later lionized in popular literature and dramatic
performances. The cult of death may also have been enhanced by the
rhetoric of Japanese Zen Buddhism&rsquo;s designation of the
&ldquo;death of the ego&rdquo; as a sign of enlightenment. Rinzai Zen
masters sometimes used that locution in training unemployed samurai
who joined the monastery during the centuries of the Tokugawa peace.
In addition, <em>bushid&#333;</em> emphasized the value of
<em>makoto</em> (genuineness or trustworthiness), a term with
originally Shint&#333; associations. Added to those native influences
was the imported nineteenth-century European ideologies of ethnic
virtue, the power of archaic words or symbols, and the purity of race
as constituting the basis for a nation state.</p>

<p>
<em>Bushid&#333;</em> philosophy is, therefore, a true hybrid of
Confucian, Buddhist, Shint&#333;, and even European parentage.
Ideologically, it claimed to have been a philosophy of the Japanese
people harking back to ancient times, but its philosophical birthdate
is clearly nineteenth century. Its hybridity occluded that history,
however, and its tenets were couched in terms deemed traditional but
often conveying newly acquired nuances. As the purported &ldquo;soul
of Japan,&rdquo; <em>bushid&#333;</em> was almost impervious to
philosophical critique, especially once it was protected by government
censorship and institutionalized in the mandatory national educational
curriculum for school children called National Morality (see Section
4.4.1 below).</p>

<p>
In an important sense <em>bushid&#333;</em> is not at all a
philosophical stream comparable to the others, but its impact should
not be overlooked because it did affect the flow (and the stagnation)
of the other streams for the first half of the twentieth century. That
brings us to an overview of the eddies and cross-currents of the five
streams as they flowed through Japanese history. The interactions
among the five streams in different periods of Japanese history is as
important as the independence of the streams themselves.</p>

<h2 id="HisPerPhiDevInt">Historical Periods of Philosophical Development and Interaction</h2>

<h3 id="AncClaPhiUp12tCen">4.1 Ancient and Classical Philosophy (up to 12<sup>th</sup> century)</h3>

<p>
The ancient and classical periods of Japanese philosophy span the
years 604 (the traditional date of Sh&#333;toku&rsquo;s
<em>Seventeen-article Constitution</em>) to 1185 (the fall of
aristocratic rule and the installation of the first military
shogunate). In the usual Japanese reckoning, it covers the Late Kofun
(or Asuka), Nara, and Heian periods. During that time Buddhism came to
dominate the philosophical landscape by allocating social and legal
considerations to Confucianism and by relegating proto-Shint&#333;
sensitivities to a subordinate place within its expanded,
all-inclusive system. Prince Regent Sh&#333;toku&rsquo;s hope, as
expressed in the <em>Constitution</em> attributed to him (JPS,
2&ndash;9), was to establish Buddhism as a state religion. Yet, he
also wished to continue state rituals venerating the proto-Shint&#333;
kami, all the while strictly adhering to Confucian ideals (along with
some Chinese Legalist ideas) in regulating behavior within a
centralized state government. (Kasulis 2020)</p>

<p>
When Nara became the first permanent imperialist capital in the eighth
century, the city plan included Buddhist temples, Shint&#333; shrines,
and Buddhist institutes or study centers, including those of the
so-called Six Nara Schools (all based on Chinese Buddhist schools with
roots traceable to India). Innovative philosophical thinking was
limited, but that would change with the establishment of two new
schools at the close of the eighth century, concurrent with the
relocation of the capital to Kyoto, namely, Tendai (founded by
Saich&#333;, 767&ndash;822) and Shingon (founded by K&#363;kai,
774&ndash;835). Although both traditions originated in China, they
assumed distinctively comprehensive Japanese forms that would set the
trajectory of Buddhist philosophy in Japan for centuries to come. The
major factor behind their success was their focus on &ldquo;esoteric
(or intimate) teachings&rdquo; (<em>mikky&#333;</em>). In establishing
that core orientation, K&#363;kai was the pioneering figure and the
more sophisticated philosopher, indeed often considered Japan&rsquo;s
greatest premodern systematic thinker. (See the entry on
 <a href="../kukai/">K&#363;kai</a>.)</p>
 
<h4>4.1.1 K&#363;kai&rsquo;s Esoteric Foundation for Japanese Philosophizing</h4>

<p>
The linchpin in K&#363;kai&rsquo;s philosophy was his distinction
between engaged and detached knowing, which he formulated in terms of
the &ldquo;difference between esoteric teachings
(<em>mikky&#333;</em>) and exoteric teachings
(<em>kengy&#333;</em>).&rdquo; (See the entry on 
 <a href="../kukai/#EsoMikVsExoKen">K&#363;kai, Section 3.2</a>.) 
 The esoteric involves an interpersonal engagement between the
cosmos (the activity of patterned, self-structuring resonances called
Dainichi Buddha) and the Shingon practitioner (who is a bodymind
holographically inscribed with the same pattern as the cosmos). Wisdom
occurs when the theory-praxis of the Shingon Buddhist enables the
cosmic functions and the person&rsquo;s actions to resonate
harmoniously.</p>

<p>
By contrast, detached or exoteric understanding, according to
K&#363;kai, occurs when there is a separation between knower and
known, a gap that can only be bridged with the external application of
linguistic categories or heuristic expressions (<em>h&#333;ben</em>;
Sanskrit: <em>up&#257;ya</em>). So, an exoteric or detached
philosophy, even if it knows of the internal relations linking
realities, necessarily depends on external relations to express itself
in words or concepts that assume a detachment between knower and
known. That led K&#363;kai to evaluate philosophical theories not
simply in terms of their positions, but also, more importantly, in
light of the ten mindsets (<em>j&#363;shin</em>) that produced each of
them. (See the entry on
 <a href="../kukai/#TenStaDevMin">K&#363;kai, section 3.12</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
K&#363;kai argued the &ldquo;mind&rdquo; of the Shingon mindset, the
most profound of the ten and the one which relegates all others, is
more like &ldquo;bodymind&rdquo; because it is a knowing inseparable
from psychophysical praxis. In K&#363;kai&rsquo;s terminology,
&ldquo;one achieves buddha in, with, and through this very body&rdquo;
(<em>sokushinj&#333;butsu</em>). (See the entry on
 <a href="../kukai/#SokEnlViaEmb">K&#363;kai, section 3.9</a>.)
 For the Shingon Buddhist philosophy of engaged knowing, there is no
detachment between self and reality. The truth is presented as a
unified bodymind performance of thought, word, and deed.</p>

<p>
Although K&#363;kai&rsquo;s philosophy itself did not become dominant
in the Japanese tradition, he set a pattern for philosophizing that
(often without acknowledgment) continued to influence many later
philosophers even into modern times. First, he firmly entrenched a
preference for internal and holographic relations. Second, he
demonstrated that a strong philosophical position should not only be
able to show weaknesses in other positions, but also should be able to
explain how such an error or misunderstanding could occur. In other
words, assimilation through relegation is a stronger position than
simple refutation because it takes opposing views as <em>real</em>
theories (part of the as-ness of reality), albeit mistaken. Third, we
can best evaluate a new philosophical position by first trying to
understand the mindset that produced it. That methodological strategy
would continue to serve Japanese philosophers well as they encountered
new theories from other cultures in future centuries.</p>

<p>
At first borrowing from Shingon, Tendai soon evolved its own form of
esotericism with additional input from emissaries sent to China for
further training. Since Tendai was already the most comprehensive form
of exoteric teaching in Japan, when mated with esotericism, it became
the most inclusive and comprehensive system of philosophy and praxis
in the country. As a result, by the end of the classical period, the
monastic center on Mt Hiei emerged as the premier site of monastic
education and philosophical training.</p>

<h4>4.1.2 Aesthetics in the Heian Court</h4>

<p>
For the lay aristocrats, the Heian court of Kyoto was the hub for the
classical study of both Chinese and Japanese arts and letters,
becoming a fertile ground for aesthetic theories. Some ideals derived
from China, others from more native sensitivities. The notion of
reality as a self-expressive field was variously expressed. It could
be addressed in terms of the native idea of <em>kokoro</em> or of the
cosmic Buddha&rsquo;s activity; it could be described as permeated
with the spiritual power of <em>kami</em> or of buddhas; it could
inspire a sensitivity to the poignancy of fleeting beauty (as in the
aesthetic of <em>aware</em> in Lady Murasaki&rsquo;s <em>Tale of
Genji</em>); or it could even appear as detached object for amusement
(as in the aesthetic of <em>okashi</em> in Sei no Shonagon&rsquo;s
<em>Pillow Book</em>).</p>

<p>
In any case, the idea of the self-expressive field became a focal
point for the cloistered world of the Heian court, a court which
generated an artistic sensitivity and vocabulary that became a
cornerstone for future Japanese aesthetics. As the classical period
drew to a close, however, the cloistered worlds of the monastery and
the Heian court would come under attack and philosophical expression
would need to find new contexts.</p>

<h3 id="MedPhiLat12tThr16tCen">4.2 Medieval Philosophy (late 12<sup>th</sup> through 16<sup>th</sup> centuries)</h3>

<p>
The medieval period witnessed the destabilization of the social,
political, and religious order. Many aristocrats abandoned their
far-flung estates, entrusting their wealth-generating domains to the
hands of their stewards, the <em>samurai</em> (&ldquo;those who
serve&rdquo;). Eventually, the samurai took control of the domains for
themselves. They then fought each other for national dominance until
the Minamoto were victorious in 1185, establishing Japan&rsquo;s first
military government or shogunate in 1192. To protect its vulnerable
position, it centered its operations in Kamakura, leaving the court
and the emperor in Kyoto. The political instability and the attendant
economic upheaval were exacerbated by an unusually devastating period
of natural disasters, pestilence, and famine.</p>

<p>
With personal survival at stake, the complex theories and practices of
Shingon and Tendai Buddhism were of little solace to most people. A
popular meme was that Buddhism had entered its final Degenerate Age
(<em>mapp&#333;</em>) in which teachings were lost, could no longer be
understood, and enlightenment no longer attained. Tendai&rsquo;s Mt
Hiei, which had been a magnet for many of Japan&rsquo;s brightest and
most gifted thinkers, lost many talented monks who in desperation
abandoned the mountain and eventually advanced new Buddhist
philosophies for the populace, resulting in new religious sects, most
notably Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren.</p>

<h4>4.2.1 The Buddhist Strategy of Selection</h4>

<p>
Among the founders of the so-called Kamakura New Religions, the Pure
Land philosopher H&#333;nen (1133&ndash;1212) expressed a seminal idea
that keynoted the greater movement. (See the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-pure-land/#JapaPureLandBuddThou">Japanese Pure Land Philosophy, Section 3</a>.)
 A noted Mt Hiei Tendai master, Honen found the daunting array of
Tendai texts and practices, both esoteric and exoteric, to be
overwhelming and frustrating. In despair, he realized that the
holographic paradigm of the whole-in-every-part opened a door to a new
strategy. The key would not be to set out to embrace the whole, but
instead to select <em>one</em> thing&ndash;&ndash;one teaching, one
practice, one text&mdash;and to focus on that, realizing that by the
holographic paradigm ultimately nothing would be lost. That
philosophical modus operandi of selection (<em>senchaku</em> or
<em>senjaku</em>) became the guiding principle for all three major
tributaries of Kamakura-period Buddhist philosophy: Pure Land, Zen,
and Nichiren.</p>

<p>
With some variation, Pure Land thinkers like H&#333;nen and Shinran
(1173&ndash;1263) concentrated on the mythos of the Vow of Amida
Buddha. The event of &ldquo;entrusting faith&rdquo; (<em>shinjin</em>)
as embodied in voicing the expression of the <em>nenbutsu</em>
(&ldquo;I take refuge in Amida Buddha&rdquo;) dissolves the ego-self
into the power of Amida Buddha&rsquo;s Vow (see the entry on 
 <a href="../japanese-pure-land/">Japanese Pure Land Philosophy</a>). 
 That surrender of ego allows one to &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; escape
the limitations of the Degenerate Age and be born into the sphere of
influence made possible by Amida Buddha&rsquo;s practice (the
&ldquo;Pure Land&rdquo;). From there, free of mapp&#333;&rsquo;s
restrictions, one can attain enlightenment.</p>

<p>
D&#333;gen (1200&ndash;1253), the founder of the Japanese
S&#333;t&#333; Zen tradition, also displayed the single-minded focus
typical of the medieval philosophers, even though he did not accept
the theory of the Degenerate Age itself. D&#333;gen selected what he
considered central to all Buddhist traditions from the outset: the
nondichotomous state of bodymind achieved in seated meditation
(<em>zazen</em>) under the guidance of a master. (See the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-zen/">Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy</a>.)
 He advocated a single practice of full engagement with as-ness or
suchness (<em>inmo</em> or <em>nyoze</em>, how phenomena are before
they are structured by concepts). It is a prereflective point that is
in itself without meaning, but is the basis from which meaning is
generated in any context. (Kasulis 2018, 218&ndash;34)</p>

<p>
For Nichiren (1222&ndash;1282), the founder of the Nichiren School,
the despair of the Degenerate Age was again the critical point of
departure, but in his interpretation, the second half of the <em>Lotus
Sutra</em> was written specifically for those times and should be the
sole focus of selection. He refined that focus down even further to a
vocalized expression of entrusting faith in the title of the <em>Lotus
Sutra</em> itself, expressed in a meditative recitation. That
selective practice activated the power of the wondrous teachings in
the sutra designed to offset the negative effects of the Degenerate
Age, not only spiritual, but material as well. Thus, Nichiren called
for a political and social transformation of the nation as intrinsic
to his religious message, a call that motivates some sectors of
Japanese politics even today.</p>

<p>
The Kamakura single-focused practices were readily accessible to
anyone, even the uneducated. Over the centuries, the Kamakura New
Religions became the most popular forms of Buddhism in Japan. At the
same time, the philosophical <em>justifications</em> for those
minimalized practices, the metapraxes, were often highly sophisticated
and have continued to attract the further reflection of some of the
best philosophical minds in Japan over the centuries. For example,
some modern Japanese philosophers found points of contact between
Western existential philosophers&rsquo; responses to <em>Angst</em>
and the medieval Buddhist philosophers&rsquo; responses to the anguish
of the Degenerate Age.</p>

<h4>4.2.2 Muromachi Aesthetics</h4>

<p>
With the decline of the cloistered Heian court, the nature of Japanese
aesthetics underwent a change as dramatic as that of religious
philosophies. After the fall of the Minamoto&rsquo;s shogunate in
Kamakura and the takeover by the Ashikaga, the new shogunate moved its
headquarters to Muromachi in Kyoto in 1338. The reestablishment of
relations with China precipitated an economic boom and revival of the
Chinese-influenced arts in the capital, but the prosperity was
short-lived. Triggered by a dispute over shogunal succession, open
warfare broke out in Kyoto, ultimately involving most of the major
regional military lords from around the country. The capital was
leveled and the &#332;nin War (1467&ndash;1477) ended in stalemate but
not before the coffers of the shogunate and the court were almost
completely depleted.</p>

<p>
Upon returning to their home regions, local wars continued and the
entire country entered the Period of Warring Domains, lasting for over
a century. Without the isolation of a cloistered community of
aristocratic courtiers, the former aesthetic categories were
superseded by new ones suggestive of retreat or withdrawal: withdrawal
from the cultured and elegant to the plainness of the rustic
(<em>wabi</em>), withdrawal from the outward glitter to the lonely,
neglected, and isolated (<em>sabi</em>), and withdrawal from the
surface to the quiet, mysterious depths (<em>y&#363;gen</em>). These
became central categories in the new art forms of tea ceremony,
poetry, n&#333; drama, and landscape gardens. (See the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-aesthetics/#WabiSimpAustBeau">Japanese Aesthetics, sections 3&ndash;5</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="EdoPerPhi160">4.3 Edo-period Philosophy (1600&ndash;1868)</h3>

<p>
The Edo period brought relative peace and stability under the Tokugawa
shogunate, making Edo (present-day Tokyo) the new center of
administration. National unification was the achievement of three
hegemons: Oda Nobunaga (1534&ndash;1582), then Toyotomi Hideyoshi
(1537&ndash;1598), and finally Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543&ndash;1616). Most
unification occurred at the hands of Nobunaga with Hideyoshi as his
chief general. A major factor in Nobunaga&rsquo;s success was his
cunning use of the new technologies of warfare (cannons and muskets)
introduced by Portuguese traders in 1543.</p>

<p>
With the Portuguese and Spanish ships came Roman Catholic
missionaries. The hegemons at times welcomed the Christians as
informants about the West and as foils against Buddhism. At other
times, though, they viciously persecuted Christians as potential
threats that might turn the people against the new political order in
favor a foreign God. In the end, Christianity was banned from the
country entirely (with most finality after the closure of Japan to
almost all Western contact after 1637).</p>

<p>
Despite some initial success in its number of conversions,
Christianity's initial impact was limited. It is true that polemical
debates with Buddhists did introduce some new lines of argument and
analysis to Japan, especially concerning creation, afterlife, and
teleology. Snippets reappeared in later Shint&#333; theories, most
notably those by Hirata Atsutane (1777&ndash;1843), for example. In
general, as a philosophical tradition, Christianity&rsquo;s impact
would be minimal until its reintroduction to Japan in the modern
period. The major philosophical import of the Edo period would not be
Christianity but a new form of Confucianism, however.</p>

<h4>4.3.1 Edo-period Confucianism</h4>

<p>
Confucianism had been part of Japan&rsquo;s intellectual tradition
since ancient times, but events in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries breathed into it new life. With their skills in Chinese
language, their general knowledge of Chinese culture, and their
intermittent personal contacts in China, Rinzai Zen Buddhist monks
often served as advisers about China to the medieval shoguns. Yet,
they had lost touch with Confucian movements in China through much of
the medieval era. So, they were startled to discover in the late
fifteenth century that, since the eleventh century, totally new forms
of Chinese Confucianism had flourished on the mainland, what Western
scholarship calls <em>neo-Confucianism</em>.</p>

<p>
Neo-Confucianism consisted of comprehensive philosophical systems that
had incorporated ideas and practices from Buddhism and Daoism,
relegating them into subordinate places within its own philosophy. The
Confucianism in Japan that was a legacy from the ancient period barely
touched on metaphysical, epistemological, and psychological issues and
had hardly mentioned themes related to nature, art, and creativity. It
had allocated such concerns to the Buddhist philosophers (who, in
turn, had relegated within their system some Daoist ideas to help
address such issues). The newly imported neo-Confucianism, however,
had assimilated enough Buddhist and Daoist ideas that it could address
a full complement of philosophical problems in a single comprehensive
system. When the second hegemon, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, brought prisoners
of war to Japan from his failed attempt to conquer Korea in the late
sixteenth century, the group included Korean officials who were also
scholars of Chinese neo-Confucianism. Some Rinzai Zen monks became
disciples and soon Japan had its own emergent schools of
neo-Confucianism, a phenomenon the ensuing Tokugawa shogunate would
welcome.</p>

<p>
The Tokugawa regime distrusted the Buddhist armies of monks on Mt Hiei
and Mt K&#333;ya and was alarmed at Buddhism&rsquo;s popularity among
peasants who rebelled (for good reason) over high taxes and the
mismanagement of agricultural resources. Hoping to centralize the
government by building up large urban centers, the shogunate believed
Confucianism could support its aims. First, compared with Buddhism and
Christianity, Confucianism in Japan was basically secular and, unlike
Buddhism, had no extensive preexisting institutional networks to
conciliate. Second, as a philosophy, Confucianism stresses communal
harmony grounded in hierarchical social relations, an ideal that had
served the state well in building Japan&rsquo;s first permanent
capital in eighth-century Nara. Perhaps it could work again. Lastly,
Confucian academies could serve the new urban, literate, and
mercantile culture the shogunate was envisioning.</p>

<p>
By the end of the seventeenth century, the home of the Tokugawa
shogunate in Edo (present-day Tokyo) had grown from a fishing village
to a metropolis larger than any city in Europe, while Kyoto and Osaka
were each close to the size of Paris. A nationwide economy flourished
by means of a network of roads and waterways supported by a system of
mercantile laws with a unified monetary system. Literacy soared as the
publication industry boomed. The effect on philosophy was profound as
its center of activity shifted from the Buddhist temples to secular
urban academies supported by student tuition. This commodification of
knowledge led to sharp competition among schools of thought, fueling
an array of new philosophies, each purporting to be an improvement on
what was available elsewhere. See the entry on
 (<a href="../japanese-confucian/#EarlModeConfMajoPhilThem">Japanese Confucian Philosophy, Section 3</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Besides schools directly imported from China, the Edo-period
Confucians developed their own variations, occasionally assimilating
aspects of Shint&#333; or Buddhism. Even more syncretic were teachers
of practical philosophy who directed their lessons to ordinary
townspeople, mixing various levels of teaching and praxis according to
the needs and talents of the students. They even built different wings
in their academies dedicated to different levels and kinds of teaching
for different audiences.</p>

<p>
A major theme across many varieties of Edo-period Confucianism was
language. As mentioned above (Section 3.2), a fundamental idea in
general Confucian philosophy is the principle of &ldquo;trueing up
terms,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;rectification of names&rdquo;
(<em>seimei</em>). Before the Edo period, that meant that to know the
meaning of a term referring to a human relation implied a mandate for
how one should act in that relation. With the expanded range of issues
addressed in the new forms of Confucianism, however, the question was
whether that same standard could be applied beyond the five binary
human relations to terms like &ldquo;human nature,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;harmony,&rdquo;
&ldquo;principle/pattern,&rdquo; &ldquo;generative force&rdquo;
(<em>ki</em>), or &ldquo;learning (<em>gaku</em>).&rdquo; Do their
essential definitions also imply normative mandates? Can a philosophy
of education or a hermeneutics of textual study, for example, be
generated out of a close analysis of the meaning of the ancient word
for &ldquo;learning&rdquo; in the classic Chinese texts? Such queries
raised a plethora of philosophical questions about the nature of
language and how to study it.</p>

<p>
Inspired by detailed Chinese glossaries of key terms, Japanese
Confucian scholars argued among themselves about the correct
understanding of central ideas by doing their own exegeses of texts,
including etymological or philological discussions. (See the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-confucian/#ConfModeJapa">Japanese Confucianism, Section 4</a>.) 
 How should we best understand the language of a text: as a fixed
artifact studied with the detachment of a philologist or as a living
form of expression to be studied with the engagement of a poet? The
Japanese Confucian philosophers of language in the Edo-period debated
such issues.</p>

<h4>4.3.2 Kokugaku (Native Studies)</h4>

<p>
The emphasis on ancient texts, language, and meanings inspired another
group of scholars to pursue an entirely different direction. The
blatant sinophilia of some of the Japanese Confucians vexed those
Japanese who wanted to deepen the appreciation of their own ancient
language and texts. The oldest Japanese texts such as <em>Kojiki</em>
had been written in the eighth century, before an effective
orthography for Japanese had been consistently standardized. As a
result, many parts of those most ancient texts were nearly
unintelligible to later readers. Philologists and literary critics in
a movement called Native Studies (<em>kokugaku</em>) took up the task
of breaking the code. (See the entry on
 <a href="../kokugaku-school/">The Kokugaku School</a>.)
 Philological and etymological discoveries inspired some thinkers,
most notably Motoori Norinaga (1730&ndash;1801), to take Native
Studies in a new direction: the quest for developing a Shint&#333;
philosophy grounded in an understanding of the most ancient Japanese
texts and their language. In essence, Norinaga hoped to do for
Shint&#333; what Edo-period Confucians were doing for their tradition
in going back to ancient texts and analyzing their original
language.</p>

<p>
As already explained, in ancient Japan, proto-Shint&#333; had the
sketch of a basic world view and set of values, but it had lacked
philosophical explanation or argumentative justification. In the early
ninth century, esoteric Buddhism supplied the philosophical
underpinnings for what was, in effect, a quite similar view of reality
as a field of interdependent, internally related events that are
always in flux. Esoteric Buddhist philosophy had relegated Shint&#333;
to being a surface manifestation of what, on a deeper level, could be
explained as a Buddhist reality. That is roughly how the situation
stood for much of the medieval period. But there were a few
exceptions.</p>

<p>
Most notably, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Shint&#333;
philosophers in the Watarai lineage began asserting a new argument:
historical priority entails ontological priority or importance. For a
creation or cosmogonic theory formulated along a diachronic timeline,
the point is clear enough: what comes first creates what comes next
and hence the latter is ontologically dependent on the former. The
remarkable point is that this claim, so common in Abrahamic theories
of genesis as well as most classical Greco-Roman cosmogonies, seems to
have been mostly unargued in Japan before the medieval period. That is
probably because Buddhist and Confucian philosophies do not strongly
highlight their traditions&rsquo; creation myths. Buddhism in
particular favors a cyclical rather than linear theory of cosmic time
and, therefore, in claiming the ontological superiority of buddhas
over their manifestations as <em>kami,</em> for example, the argument
was based on a metaphysical or logical argument, not an appeal to
which came first chronologically.</p>

<p>
Shint&#333; philosophy, however, in the centuries following the
Watarai formulations, undertook a quest for the
primordial&ndash;&ndash;the primal energy of creation, the primal
source of language, the primal origin of the Japanese land and its
people. Certainly, we find that emphasis in Native Studies, in both
its early philological and literary project as well as in its focus on
<em>Kojiki</em>. Because of Norinaga&rsquo;s influence,
<em>Kojiki</em> became not only the central canon for Shint&#333;, but
it was also revered as the oldest text with substantial portions
written in the &ldquo;original&rdquo; language of the Japanese people
(<em>yamato no kotoba</em>). That language was understood to consist
of word-things (<em>koto</em>) imbued with the creative spirit of
ancient Japan (<em>yamato no damashii</em>). (See the entry on
 <a href="../kokugaku-school/#MotoNori1730">The Kokugaku School, Section 3.2</a>.)
 That claim continued into the nineteenth-century ethnocentric and
militarist ideology of State Shint&#333; that argued for the
restoration of the original purity of the Japanese people and their
appropriate role in the &ldquo;new moment of world history.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>4.3.3 Edo-period Buddhism</h4>

<p>
Although the Buddhists of the Edo period produced a large corpus of
critical and sectarian studies, their philosophical creativity did not
match that of their Confucian or Native Studies contemporaries. There
were exceptions, of course. For example, Jiun Sonja (1718&ndash;1804)
was a Shingon monk whose career reversed the typical pattern of the
times in that he was first a Confucian and then converted to Buddhism.
As a student enrolled in the Confucian academy of It&#333; Jinsai
(1627&ndash;1705), he learned the rigors of Confucian philology as a
way of unearthing the original meaning of early Chinese texts. That
inspired Jiun to investigate the roots of Buddhism, but its relevant
ancient texts were in Sanskrit, a language then little studied in
Japan. Undaunted, he undertook a rigorous program of self-study until
he eventually became Japan&rsquo;s premier premodern authority on
Sanskrit. Based on his research, Jiun argued for what he believed to
be the initial form of Buddhism that preceded and transcended the
various sectarian forms known to the Japanese.</p>

<p>
As a philosopher, Jiun&rsquo;s acumen was best displayed in his
arguments in favor of Buddhist over Confucian ethics. Against the
Confucian charge that Buddhism was antinomian, Jiun pointed to the ten
Buddhist precepts, the prohibitions against &ldquo;killing, stealing,
adultery, lying, frivolous language, slander, equivocation, greed,
anger, and wrong views.&rdquo; In comparison with the Confucian
virtues, Jiun argued, they were more specific (and therefore more
practical). More importantly, they could be metaphysically justified
and confirmed by the Buddhist experiences of as-ness and universal
buddha-nature. In other words, he asserted that Buddhist ethics emerge
from an analysis based in the engagement with immanent reality,
whereas Confucian ethics derived from the detached study of texts
assumed to be authoritative. (Watt 1984)</p>

<p>
As Sinophilia increased among Rinzai Zen monks in the later medieval
and Edo periods, many Rinzai monasteries became centers for practicing
the arts and letters, much in the tradition of the Chinese literati
and often to the neglect of established Zen disciplines. Occasionally,
Rinzai masters like Hakuin Ekaku (1685&ndash;1768) reacted against
this development and urged a revival of intense and rigorous forms of
praxis. Rinzai masters such as Takuan S&#333;h&#333;
(1573&ndash;1645), Suzuki Sh&#333;san (1579&ndash;1655), and
Shid&#333; Bunan (or Munan 1603&ndash;1676) tried to find points of
contact between Zen and the martial experience of their former samurai
students. One strategy was to compare the warrior&rsquo;s fearlessness
in the face of death with the Zen monk&rsquo;s fearlessness in the
face of losing the ego-self. Of course, the former is restricted to
the battlefield whereas the latter should be an attitude of egoless
engagement within all the events of everyday life.</p>

<h3 id="ModPos186Phi">4.4 Modern (post-1868) Philosophy</h3>

<p>
By convention the <em>Modern Period</em> in Japan is said to have
begun with the formal restoration of the emperor to power in 1868,
replacing what had become an economically and politically ineffectual
Tokugawa shogunate. U.S. gunships entered Tokyo harbor in 1854,
forcing Japan to open its doors to mercantile exchange with the West
and to accept severely unfavorable trade agreements, first with the
United States, and then Britain and Russia. Japan's intelligentsia
realized they must modernize quickly or fall victim to Western
imperialism. Their hope was that somehow Japan could achieve that
modernization by allocating a balance between &ldquo;Japanese spirit
and Western ingenuity&rdquo; (<em>wakon y&#333;sai</em>), that is, by
finding a way to maintain its fundamental cultural values while
adopting Western education, science, and technology. That challenge
inspired much of the philosophical thinking in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries.</p>

<p>
Edo-period Confucianism&rsquo;s reliance on ancient texts seemed out
of touch with the demands for modernization. In response, increasing
emphasis was placed on the acceptance of Western philosophical
theories along with Western technologies and social institutions. The
Japanese particularly gravitated toward positivism&rsquo;s rejection
of religious metaphysics in favor of empiricism. They also admired
utilitarianism for its consequentialist ethics that used an
empirically derived calculus for determining what would bring maximum
happiness or pleasure to society as a whole. Lastly, Rousseau&rsquo;s
romantic version of freedom and Mill&rsquo;s <em>On</em>
<em>Liberty</em> enthused a generation about the prospect for a
Japanese democracy in the form of a constitutional monarchy. The
intellectuals proudly referred to their time as the &ldquo;Meiji
Enlightenment.&rdquo; Powerful intellectual forces inhibited this
aspiration for liberal democracy, however. Ironically, they were the
very same ideologies that had led to the Imperial Restoration of 1868
in the first place.</p>

<h4>4.4.1 Ideologies of Imperial Restoration</h4>

<p>
Three philosophical ideologies had coalesced to support the overthrow
of the shogunate and restoration of the emperor. First, the Mito
School, a think tank of intellectual historians who for centuries were
writing a comprehensive history of Japan, had developed a holographic
political interpretation of the imperial system as <em>kokutai</em>.
(See section 2.2 above.) That helped define the ideological centrality
of the emperor for Japanese national identity and established a firm
basis for absolute loyalty to the imperial system.</p>

<p>
 <a name="_Hlk190155521">The second philosophical ideology to support the Imperial Restoration was Native Studies.</a>
 It went beyond its original philological and textual interests to
construct a Shint&#333; theory of racial purity based in a world view
purported to be implicit in the ancient Japanese language, mythic
narratives, and a primordial view of the land and country. According
to those mythic narratives, the celestial <em>kami</em> had appointed
the imperial family to rule over the domain. Supposedly predating
influences from the Asian continent including Buddhism and
Confucianism, so-called Restoration Shinto served as a major resource
for the ideology of State Shint&#333;&rsquo;s vision of a pure
Japanese ethnicity and spirituality. That served as a nucleus of the
first half of the &ldquo;Japanese spirituality and Western
ingenuity&rdquo; formula of allocation.</p>

<p>
Third, during the Edo period, a warrior code that included the
willingness to die in loyal service to one&rsquo;s lord grew in
popularity among the samurai houses throughout Japan. Because of their
long-standing grudges against the Tokugawa, as the shogunate weakened,
the samurai domains in the far western provinces of Satsuma and
Ch&#333;sh&#363; transferred their loyalties from the shogunate to the
emperor. That lent a militarist and ethical rationale to the Imperial
Restoration movement and became a basis for the Way of the warrior
movement (<em>bushid&#333;</em>) in the early 20th century.</p>

<p>
The practical exigencies had become so dire that the shogunate might
have crumbled without the support of the three philosophical
ideologies. Yet, the ideologies mirrored developments in European
nation-building at the time. Like the models from Germany and Italy,
for example, the new Japanese state honed its own identity as a
nation-state by basing itself in ancient myths of racial uniformity,
warrior heroism, ethnic purity, and a claim to a primordial linguistic
homogeneity.</p>

<h4>4.4.2 Modern Academic Philosophies</h4>

<p>
As <em>tetsugaku,</em> the philosophy within university departments
better fit the &ldquo;Western ingenuity&rdquo; side of the <em>wakon
y&#333;sai</em> allocation formula, especially as it restricted itself
to the subfields of epistemology, logic, philosophy of science, and
metaphysics. The more the academic philosophers ventured into ethics,
political philosophy, the philosophy of religion, and even
philosophical anthropology, however, the more likely they were to
deviate from the official state ideology. Censorship or even
imprisonment was the punishment.</p>

<p>
Still, philosophers like Inoue Tetsujir&#333; (1855&ndash;1944),
Japan&rsquo;s first native born professor of philosophy and head of
the department at Tokyo Imperial University used his considerable
prestige to lend philosophical support to the <em>kokutai</em> theory
against liberal democracy and to develop <em>bushid&#333;</em> from a
code of samurai warriors into a National Morality to be taught in the
public school system. He based his full-bodied theory of
<em>bushid&#333;</em> in Japanese ethnicity, loyalty to the
<em>kokutai,</em> moral discipline, and the study of virtue. For
Inoue, it seems, ethics was mainly morality and, as such, belonged on
the spirituality side of the <em>wakon y&#333;sai</em> allocation. In
fact, he criticized utilitarian ethics for its overly scientific
approach.</p>

<p>
Others, perhaps in response to Inoue&rsquo;s collaboration with the
state ideology, stayed more squarely within the mode of Western
philosophy but tried to develop a more expansive version of
<em>tetsugaku</em> that would allow for Japanese ethical, spiritual,
and aesthetic sensitivities. Nishida Kitar&#333; (1870&ndash;1945),
the founder of what became known as the Kyoto School, tried to
assimilate Western empiricism and Western idealism by relegating them
into a subordinate position within his more comprehensive system of
experience and judgments, a system that grounded itself in the
Buddhist notion of nothingness. (See entries on Nishida Kitar&#333;;
The Kyoto School.) In general, although still under the sway of German
philosophy, many important philosophers of the first half of the
twentieth century including Tanabe Hajime (1865&ndash;1962), Kuki
Sh&#363;z&#333; (1888&ndash;1941), and Watsuji Tetsur&#333;
(1889&ndash;1960) developed philosophies that stressed culture as a
crucial dimension of thought, being critical of what seemed to them
the overly simplistic dualities of either the individual vs. the
universal or individualism vs. collectivism that seemed to dominate
most Western logical and social theories. Yet, in stressing the
importance of the cultural and ethnic dimension of human existence,
they sometimes found themselves either wittingly or unwittingly
considered allies of the imperial state ideology. (See the entry on
 <a href="../watsuji-tetsuro/">Watsuji Tetsur&#333;</a>;
 for Tanabe, see the entry on
 <a href="../kyoto-school/#TanAbsNotOthPowAbsMed">The Kyoto School, Section 3.4</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
For the most part, Confucianism in the Edo period often functioned
more as a secular philosophy than a religious tradition. With its
hierarchical social ethic, it posed no threat to State Shint&#333;
ideology. Edifying narratives of virtuous (often samurai) Confucians
from the Edo period made their way into the National Morality
curriculum and the Confucian emphasis on academic study, including
Chinese medicine, was a model for the modern student. Yet, it still
seemed to many Westernized intellectuals embarrassingly unmodern. Not
fitting comfortably into either side of the <em>wakon-y&#333;sai</em>
allocation, it did not acquire the creative ideological fervor of some
other movements.</p>

<p>
Buddhism was in a different situation because it had been both a
religion and a philosophy in premodern Japan. As a
&ldquo;foreign&rdquo; religion, it was suspect as a pollutant to the
pure Japanese spirituality of State Shint&#333; and it suffered
various forms of persecution. Mobs even desecrated Buddhist cemeteries
and altars within private homes. The major Buddhist reaction was to be
institutionally accommodating, encouraging monks to marry and to serve
the national population-growth mandate by having families, for
example.</p>

<p>
Buddhism also formulated a philosophical response of assimilation,
though. Buddhist philosophy already included a wide variety of schools
of thought with their own versions of experiential verification,
theories of consciousness, forms of dialectical logic, alternative
forms of knowing, and so forth. Even in the turn-of-the-century West,
it was fashionable in some quarters to consider Early Buddhism as an
empirical philosophy. Consequently, some of the brightest young
Buddhist seminarians enrolled in philosophy programs at the Imperial
Universities, creating a synergy between Western and Buddhist
philosophy in Japan that continues until the present. In addition,
intrigued by the manner in which Christian theology was drawing on
nineteeth- and twentieth-century European philosophies, seeds of
so-called Buddhist-Christian dialogue began to germinate and fully
blossomed in the post-censorship era after 1945.</p>

<h4>4.4.3 Postwar Philosophies</h4>

<p>
The postwar period has witnessed three general developments. First,
finally freed of censorship, liberal and leftist thinkers scorned the
very idea of &ldquo;Japanese&rdquo; philosophy as smacking of
nativism, ethnocentrism, jingoism, and State Shint&#333; ideology.
Even assimilative traditions like the Kyoto School (either fairly or
unfairly) came under attack. In response, the immediate postwar
generations in most Japanese philosophy departments escaped into
Western philosophy, sometimes carried out with a sense of now
anti-nativist purity that rivaled the earlier ethnocentric movement.
Consequently, the large majority of Japanese academic philosophers
trained in the latter half of the twentieth century have pursued
philosophy according to methods and themes hardly distinguishable from
those of the West.</p>

<p>
The second postwar response has been for traditions like the Kyoto
School, conceived in the period 1910&ndash;1945, to evolve without the
old state ideology&rsquo;s casting a shadow on the enterprise. This
movement has generated increasing interest among philosophers in
Europe and the United States, especially those from the more
Continental-influenced traditions. The Kyoto School is beginning to
assume its place in global philosophical forums alongside European
schools of thought such as the Marburg or Frankfurt Schools.</p>

<p>
Lastly, with the greater availability of translations into European
languages and the sprouting of learned societies for Japanese
philosophy in Asia, the United States, and Europe, there is increasing
evidence of cross-influence and hybridization. Even Western
philosophers who do not consider themselves Japan specialists are
participating in the cross-pollination of ideas. As a philosopher does
not need to know Danish to be influenced by Kierkegaard, a philosopher
no longer needs to know Japanese to be influenced by, or even
contribute to, Japanese philosophy. The last section of this entry
outlines some themes in Japanese philosophy that may in the future
stimulate philosophers of various backgrounds and national
origins.</p>

<h2 id="PosConPhiLar">5. Possible Contributions to Philosophy at Large</h2>

<h3 id="MetPhiWisWay">5.1 Metaphilosophy: Philosophy as <em>Wissenschaft</em> or Way?</h3>

<p>
Japanese philosophy presents alternative models to today&rsquo;s
common paradigm of philosophy as a <em>Wissenschaft,</em> a form of
detached knowing that functions as a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;
discipline within the modern academy. When Japanese philosophy
considers itself a Way rather than a <em>Wissenschaft</em>, it
stresses engagement over detachment. As an enterprise that may
transform both knower and known through a bodymind theory-praxis, that
Japanese version of philosophy seems to parallel some aspects of
Western philosophy in its original, ancient Greek form which also
emphasized loving wisdom rather than detached knowledge as well as
knowing oneself rather than impersonal analysis. The geographical
restrictiveness of much of today&rsquo;s Western philosophy is what
Bret Davis calls its &ldquo;Euromonopolism.&rdquo; (Davis 2022,
18&ndash;23), a prejudice that limits not only its understanding of
the world today, but also of philosophy itself. Thus, the study of
Japanese philosophy raises not only philosophical questions, but also
opens into metaphilosophical questions about what philosophy is,
whether there are different kinds of philosophy, and how different
models of philosophy may interrelate.</p>

<h3 id="ReaFie">5.2 Reality as Field</h3>

<p>
Philosophers often think of reality as consisting of elements
discovered, engineered, combined, and adapted to meet the needs of
their particular systems. In thinking about those elements of reality,
Western philosophy has often depended on primary concepts like
<em>things</em>, <em>facts</em>, <em>stuff</em>, <em>sensations</em>,
<em>subject</em>, <em>object</em>, <em>being</em>, <em>substance</em>,
<em>essence</em>, <em>attribute</em>, <em>quality</em>, and so forth.
As that list of elemental concepts has become standardized, it has
served as a glossary for future thinking and further philosophical
initiatives. Philosophers may discover or even craft new elements, but
they do so against that preexisting background, like filling gaps
within the periodic table. Commonly, those elements are thought to be
fixed entities that are connected or acted upon by relational forces
such as causes or agents. Change may also be understood as occurring
through the interaction of forces in dynamic opposition, including
dialectical opposition.</p>

<p>
By contrast, Japanese philosophers typically view reality in terms of
a complex, organic system of interdependent processes, a system that
includes themselves as the knowers. Thus, the point of departure for
the analysis is not a separation between knower and known. Instead, to
know reality is to work with it, not as a discrete agent, but as part
of a common field, designated by such terms as <em>kokoro</em> or the
&ldquo;midst&rdquo; (<em>aidagara</em>). The field consists not of
things as much as events or processes such as <em>event-words</em>
(koto), <em>interpenetration</em>, <em>generative force</em> (ki),
<em>performative intuition</em>, <em>pure experience</em>,
<em>naturalness</em> (jinen), and so forth. In most Japanese
philosophies, oppositional polarities do not create dynamism, but
rather, dynamism is the primary event out of which the polarities can
be abstracted after the fact. Each polarity has no independent
existence of its own and so cannot cause anything. The polarities only
have explanatory value for <em>how</em> the dynamism flows, showing
its vectors of activity.</p>

<p>
How might a field model of reality&mdash;especially one that
explicitly places the thinker within the field being
analyzed&mdash;challenge the way classical Western philosophical
problems have been posed and addressed? For one, philosophizing would
seem to emanate not from the thinking thing (<em>res cogitans</em>)
but, as suggested by Yuasa Yasuo, from the field of bodymind praxis.
(See Section 2.1 above.)</p>

<h3 id="AgeNoIVsAutSel">5.3 The Agency of No-I vs. Autonomous Self</h3>

<p>
Most Western philosophies, as well as Abrahamic religious theologies,
think of personal identity as a discrete, independently existing,
autonomous agency. That view in turn generates certain assumptions
about creative authorship, ethical responsibility, and religious faith
in a transcendent reality. Such a view of personal identity is seldom
found in Japanese philosophy, however. Instead, the self is defined by
a field of interdependent relationships. Confucianism sees the
defining relations as a set of interpersonal roles, Buddhism as a
broader set of interdependent events or conditions. (Shint&#333; has
multiple theories, including sometimes an idea of an individual soul,
but even that is often considered holographically inscribed with a
collective soul.) If there is generally no independent &ldquo;I&rdquo;
in Japanese philosophy, then how might we understand agency in such
areas as artistic creativity, ethics, and religious faith?</p>

<h4>5.3.1 Artistic Agency</h4>

<p>
Although there is an abundance of aesthetic theories in the Japanese
tradition, artistic creativity is generally thought to originate not
in the artist but in the artist&rsquo;s engagement within a field that
includes the medium, the auto-expressive character of reality, and the
audience. All that together&mdash;artist, medium, reality, and
audience&mdash;comprises <em>kokoro</em> in its fullest sense. The
creativity within art originates not in the individual&rsquo;s
self-expression but in <em>kokoro&rsquo;s</em> auto-expression.
(Kasulis 2008)</p>

<p>
Hence, in creating the work of art, the rock gardener may speak of
&ldquo;listening to the rocks,&rdquo; the <em>ikebana</em> master of
&ldquo;working <em>with</em> the flowers.&rdquo; In his theory of
poetics, Motoori Norinaga stressed the importance of the audience as
part of the field of <em>kokoro,</em> claiming that an unread poem is
not yet a poem. In the classical Western tradition, creativity was
sometimes construed as the artist&rsquo;s being inspired by a muse, in
effect a double agency. Yet, both agencies&mdash;artist and
muse&mdash;were discrete individuals. How would a philosophy of
artistic creativity be different if it is one with no discrete
individuals, but instead a complex process of an auto-generative
field? That would seem to be a provocative question for comparative
aesthetics. (See the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-aesthetics/">Japanese Aesthetics</a>.)</p>
 
<h4>5.3.2 Ethics without Discrete Agents</h4>

<p>
As many Japanese theories of creativity recognize the agency arising
within a field of engagement without the need for a discrete,
independently existing &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the same can be said for many
ethical theories. With their tenet of no-I, Japanese Buddhist
philosophers typically stress egoless responsiveness within a
situation rather than the individual&rsquo;s responsibility to follow
fixed rules, principles, or divine mandates. Yet, from a Western
philosophical standpoint, it may seem paradoxical to speak of an
ethics without either principles or a sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>
One way to open a dialogue with the West on this issue is to consider
the critique posed by the aforementioned medieval Pure Land
philosopher, Shinran, who argued against making rationality the basis
for ethics. Basically, he insisted that to try to rationally determine
what is right is to distance oneself from the field of events, to make
the self an ego detached from the flow of reality by the very act of
trying to &ldquo;figure it out&rdquo; (<em>hakarai</em>). Engagement
with the events as they occur, by contrast, enables a form of knowing
that allows a compassionate response, the true basis of ethics.
Detachment from events not only feeds the ego (<em>I</em> know what is
right) but also thwarts the internal relationships that make
compassion possible. So, Shinran argues, the attempt to know what is
right and to apply rational principles undermines rather than enables
true moral behavior. (See the entry on
 <a href="../japanese-pure-land/#PureLandBuddEthiRefl">Japanese Pure Land Philosophy, section 4.4</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
In light of that analysis, on what grounds can we prefer an ethics of
responsibility over one of responsiveness or vice versa? The modern
philosopher Watsuji Tetsur&#333; claimed that ethics is the
manifestation of a philosophical anthropology (Watsuji 1996). That is,
our ethical theories reflect our understanding of what it means to be
human. Presumably, the same philosophical anthropology informing our
ethics would also underlie, for example, our theories of knowledge,
aesthetics, and politics. If that is correct, ethics cannot be a
subfield of philosophical inquiry separate from other subfields. For
Watsuji, ethics is inseparable from the cultural milieu
(<em>f&#363;do</em>) from which we derive meaning as human beings in
all aspects of our lives. As Watsuji put it, &ldquo;the study of
ethics is the study of human being.&rdquo; (See the entry on
 <a href="../watsuji-tetsuro/#Wat">Watsuji Tetsur&#333;, Sections 2&ndash;3</a>.)
 Japanese philosophies challenge the sharp bifurcation between the
prescriptive and descriptive that has been assumed by much Western
philosophy since David Hume.</p>

<h4>5.3.3 Faith without Self-Other</h4>

<p>
The Japanese notion of agency without an independent agent has
ramifications within religious philosophy as well, especially in
relation to faith. If there is no discrete self and no discrete
transcendent being, how can Shin Buddhism explain its central idea of
&ldquo;entrusting faith&rdquo; (<em>shinjin</em>)? Again, Shinran has
the most philosophically sophisticated explanation.</p>

<p>
First, it is crucial to underscore that entrusting faith is directed
not to Amida Buddha (as we might expect in a theistic religion) but
rather to Amida&rsquo;s Vow to help bring to enlightenment those who
cannot make it on their own. In fact, Amida Buddha as a person is only
a heuristic device allowing me a focal point for my entrusting faith
so that I can surrender all senses of ego and self-agency to it. Once
I do so, I as a discrete entity disappear into the field of as-ness,
which is Amida in its true, impersonal form as infinite light. In
other words as long as there is a subject having the entrusting faith,
that faith directs itself to depend on the power of the object (the
Vow of the personal Amida). But as the dependence on that objectified
other-power becomes complete, the subject (the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who has
the entrusting faith) dissolves. Yet, if there is no subject, the
object must simultaneously disappear as well. The result is just the
spontaneous naturalness of the agentless field, what Shinran calls the
&ldquo;working of nonworking&rdquo; (<em>mugi no gi</em>).</p>

<p>
Shinran&rsquo;s account is certainly a powerful description for
understanding &ldquo;faith&rdquo; in a nontheistic religion. Yet, even
some theistic religions on the mystical end of the spectrum may speak
of a God that disappears when engaged fully in a faith that overcomes
dualism. The aforementioned Kyoto School includes thinkers like Ueda
Shizuteru and Nishitani Keiji who have pursued comparisons with
Meister Eckhart on precisely those grounds (Ueda 2004).</p>

<h3 id="LanMea">5.4 Language and Meaning</h3>

<p>
At least since Aristotle (see his <em>Metaphysics</em> 1011), Western
philosophers have commonly assumed that the primary meaning (or truth)
of words lies in their ability to refer to already existing realities.
Often implicit in that assumption is that (1) reality is fixed, or at
least stable enough to be pinned down by linguistic expression; (2)
context is not necessarily determinative in meaning; (3) the audience
is irrelevant or at least externally, not internally, related to the
meaning of the expression; (4) the semantic and syntactic, but not
phonetic, aspects of the language carry the meaning; and (5) language
defines and restricts the possible meanings of things or events. Every
one of those assumptions has been challenged by major Japanese
philosophers, both classical and modern. In fact, some important
thinkers have in one way or another denied or at least qualified
<em>all</em> of them.</p>

<p>
From the Buddhist standpoint of reality as a field of interdependent
events in continuous flux, if words stand in external relation to that
reality, they are perpetually trying to hit a moving target. If
instead language arises from engagement with the field itself, then
the words, reality, and speaker will express the moment together as
part of the flux. As the contexts change, so also will the forms of
expression. Thus, starting with the sound of words as his foundation,
K&#363;kai spoke of the internal relations among sound-word-reality.
We could say K&#363;kai&rsquo;s view is that the truth of words arises
from their ability to confer with, rather than refer to, reality. (See
the entry on
 <a href="../kukai/#ManCosSouCon">K&#363;kai, Section 3.7</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The medieval Zen master D&#333;gen distinguished the raw phenomenal
presence (<em>genj&#333;</em>) that precedes meaning from how it
acquires meanings through its dependence within a contextual field.
Thus, the same presence may shift its meaning as the field shifts.
&ldquo;If we inquire into the manner and style of the totality of
phenomena&hellip;, we should bear in mind there are many worlds
everywhere.&rdquo; (JPS 146) That is, language and phenomena are parts
of single field that is in flux and can auto-generate multiple
contexts and meanings. A &ldquo;book&rdquo; may become a
&ldquo;paperweight&rdquo; as I smack it down when a puff of wind
begins to blow away the papers on my desk, for example.</p>

<p>
The audience is part of the field shared by words, speakers, and
things. Different expressions are used in addressing different people.
For most Japanese Buddhist philosophies, ordinary language is always
heuristic expression (<em>h&#333;ben</em>; Sankrit:
<em>up&#257;ya</em>) in that words are directed to someone to lead
them to some insight. So words are always being adjusted. Mori Arimasa
(1911&ndash;1976) noted that Japanese syntax demands multiple levels
of formality and politeness indicating the social space shared by
speaker and listener. That characteristic, he claims, gives the
language an inherently second-person, rather than impersonal,
third-person feel (JPS 1047&ndash;52).</p>

<p>
Another way Japanese philosophers of language analyze how words can
address the fluidity of the field of impermanent, interdependent
events is to develop theories that focus on the predicate rather than
subject of the sentence as the nucleus of meaning. The sentential
subject is usually a noun that refers to a substance and the predicate
its attribute. To capture a world of events rather than things, on the
other hand, one can focus on the meaning as emerging from predicate,
the subject becoming in effect a modifier rather than a cause or agent
of the event. Such predicate-based analyses of language were developed
by Sakabe Megumi (1936&ndash;2009), Nishida Kitar&#333;
(1870&ndash;1945), and the linguist Tokieda Motoki (1900&ndash;1967).
(JPS 979&ndash;92)</p>

<p>
A final strategy for approaching the word-thing relation is to turn
the usual Western assumption upside down and claim that there are no
things (<em>mono</em>) at all until language fixates events
(<em>koto</em>) by imposing names on them. That is, words do not refer
to pre-existing things, but rather, words create things. The
psychiatrist-philosopher Kimura Bin (1931&ndash;2021) has analyzed the
human compulsion to stabilize and reify the flow of events as an
effort to reinforce our sense of a discrete ego (JPS
958&ndash;72).</p>

<p>
Ueda Shizuteru (1926&ndash;2019), a member of the Kyoto School,
developed a detailed theory of language along similar lines (JPS
766&ndash;84). Like Zen Master D&#333;gen, Ueda argues language
translates the empty, not-yet-meaningful &ldquo;pre-thing&rdquo;
(<em>Vor-sache</em>) into a <em>thing</em> with meaning. Having evoked
that meaning, the word recedes back into the hollow void and the thing
takes its place in the totality we call &ldquo;world.&rdquo; If we
need to subsequently point to those things, we can again call up the
word that originally conjured up the thing since the word-thing link
has already been established and the word can simply refer back to
that link without creating anything new. That is not the whole story,
however. There are other words (fictional, metaphorical, poetic
expressions) that do not point to such things in the world at all but
are &ldquo;hollow words.&rdquo; Such words are not about things as
much as they are about words themselves or, better stated, about
<em>how</em> words work. Ueda claims, therefore, that through poetic
and religious language, we do not learn about things, but about the
origin of things, about how the &ldquo;world&rdquo; came into being
and how meaning is generated.</p>

<h3 id="PhiGenRacQueFemPhi">5.5 Philosophies of Gender and Race; Queer and Feminist Philosophies</h3>

<p>
In recent decades, there has been a marked shift in Japanese
philosophical studies, with increasing attention on a previously
understudied facet of the field: the contributions of women thinkers
throughout history. Combined with the dominance of the Western
philosophical canon, Asian women have been doubly invisible (Arisaka
2000). New research has sought to redress this imbalance by expanding
the scope of the history of philosophy to encompass non-Western
philosophies and to reintegrate women into the historical continuum of
human thought. For instance, in Japan&rsquo;s case, the classical
figure, Murasaki Shikibu, is now recognized as the country&rsquo;s
first known female philosopher (Wawrytko 2023), while modern authors
such as Yosano Akiko, Hiratsuka Raich&#333;, and Yamakawa Kikue (JPS
2011) have been acknowledged as philosophers as well.</p>

<p>
These recent studies have implications extending far beyond the
Japanese cultural realm. They can be a valuable resource for
comparative philosophy, particularly in fields such as ethics,
critical theory, or feminist and gender studies. For instance, a
number of studies have been published that focus on the female
perspective in Buddhism (Yusa 2019), Confucian moral education (Racel
2022), and bioethics (Morioka 2015). In addition, some researchers
have addressed other masculinities (Morioka 2013) and non-gendered
sexuality (Kimura 2019).</p>

<p>
The historical progression of feminisms has also undergone
reinterpretation, providing us a more comprehensive and nuanced
understanding of the subject (see Buckley 1997, Bullock et al. 2017,
Kano 2016, Fujimura-Fanselow and Kameda 1995, McCarthy 2017). As
demonstrated by recent theorists of intersectionality, this line of
research has further contributed to an increasing awareness how
differences among individuals, such as sexual orientation, class,
race, and age may overlap. That, in turn, may lead to overlapping ways
of oppressing individual women, altering the experience of living as a
woman in society. Consequently, beyond the controversial ethical and
social issues that typically, but not exclusively, affect women
(<em>e.g.</em>, prostitution, pornography, reproductive rights, and
motherhood), these studies offer more complex and alternative pictures
of the relationships among the individual, family, labor, and state in
a national and transnational perspective.</p>

<p>
These five broad themes and approaches suggest just a few of the
riches in Japanese philosophy that might intrigue a philosopher from
any culture. As Japanese philosophy becomes better known and
increasingly accessible through translation and Western-language
commentaries, it seems likely it may engage an ever-wider circle of
philosophers worldwide, becoming a resource for Western philosophy as
Western philosophy has historically been a resource for it.</p>
