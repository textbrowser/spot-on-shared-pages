<p>
Experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics is the application of
the methods of
 <a href="../experimental-philosophy/">experimental philosophy</a>
 
<!--pdf include (see entry) pdf include--> to questions about art and
aesthetics. By taking a scientific approach to experiences with art
and aesthetic phenomena, it is continuous with the longstanding
research program in psychology called <em>empirical aesthetics</em>
(see Nadal &amp; Vartanian 2022 for overviews of work in this
program). However, it is also continuous with traditional research in
philosophy of art and aesthetics because it is centered on many of the
same timeless questions. Like other branches of experimental
philosophy, such as
 <a href="../experimental-moral/">experimental moral philosophy</a>,
 it involves gathering data using empirical methods and bringing
analyses of the data to bear on theorizing on a wide range of topics
in philosophy of art and aesthetics: definition of art, ontology of
art, aesthetic properties, aesthetic judgments, aesthetic adjectives,
morality and aesthetics, and emotion and art. In this entry, we
briefly examine the history prior to the current movement&rsquo;s
emergence in the 2010s, extensively survey extant works in this
movement on each of the topics, and consider methodological debates
regarding this movement.</p>

<h2 id="HisEmpResArtAes">1. History of Empirical Research on Art and Aesthetics</h2>

<p>
Modern scientific approaches to art and aesthetics find their origins
in Germany in the nineteenth century, in some of earliest works in
experimental psychology. Most notably, with his <em>Vorschule der
Aesthtik</em> (1876), Gustav Fechner pioneered what came to be known
as &ldquo;bottom-up aesthetics&rdquo;, which tried to discover general
laws of taste by examining preferences for simple geometric shapes
such as rectangles of varying proportions, colors, and arrangements of
lines (for a summary of &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; aesthetics, see Nadal
&amp; Ure&ntilde;a 2022).</p>

<p>
In mid-twentieth century, art historian and philosopher Thomas
Munro&mdash;who founded the American Society of Aesthetics in 1942 and
served as the editor of the society&rsquo;s publication <em>The
Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</em> between 1945 and
1964&mdash;continually expressed optimism about the prospect of
integrating philosophical and scientific approaches to aesthetics
(1928, 1948, 1951, 1956, 1963). In &ldquo;The Psychology of Art: Past,
Present and Future&rdquo; (1963), Munro observes that philosophers
have actually been asking, for a long time, questions about art and
aesthetics that are at least partly empirical, such as <em>how do
artists come to create works? how does the experience of art affect
the audience&rsquo;s character? are there rules by which the arts can
please and instruct? do some works universally please across epochs
and cultures? how can different species of aesthetic pleasure be
taxonomized?</em>. In &ldquo;Methods in the Psychology of Art&rdquo;
(1948), he notes that authors in <em>The Journal of Aesthetics and Art
Criticism</em> often make empirical claims as part of their arguments,
and so should use empirical methods more.</p>

<p>
Not all philosophers have been as optimistic as Munro. George Dickie
(1962) argued that psychology is not relevant to aesthetics. Some of
Dickie&rsquo;s worries echoed earlier ones: for example, he argued
that the psychology of art was impoverished by simplified stimuli,
such as the use of geometric shapes rather than real artworks (compare
Arnheim 1952). Other worries were due to his specific conceptions of
philosophy of art and aesthetics, and philosophy in general. First,
Dickie believed that aesthetics is &ldquo;concerned only with the
language and concepts which are used to describe and evaluate works of
art&rdquo; (1962: 289), and so questions outside of this
conception&mdash;such as <em>how do artists come to create
works?</em>&mdash;are simply irrelevant. Second, Dickie believed that
philosophy is discontinuous with science, such that &ldquo;the
problems of ethics are not solved by a scientific study nor are the
problems of the philosophy of science&rdquo; and aesthetics is no
exception (1962: 301&ndash;302).</p>

<p>
While Dickie&rsquo;s criticisms, and hardline view, held considerable
sway over philosophical aesthetics and the philosophy of art in the
second half of the twentieth century, this has not continued. From the
late 1980s onwards, philosophical aestheticians and philosophers of
art have increasingly appealed to the findings of cognitive sciences
(for a summary, see entry on
 <a href="../aesthetics-cogsci/">aesthetics and cognitive science</a>),
 and to a lesser extent to the findings of empirical aesthetics, and
particularly evolutionary aesthetics (see, for example, Dutton 2009).
Indeed, from around 2010 onwards, philosophers joined the
psychologists of art and empirical aestheticians in conducting
empirical studies.</p>

<p>
In some ways, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly where modern
empirical aesthetics and the psychology of art ends, and the
experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics, begins. But a rough
characterization can be made along the lines that Dickie suggested.
Empirical aesthetics and the psychology of art is primarily concerned
with characterizing the psychological responses to art and
aesthetically significant objects. It answers questions such as:
<em>what is the nature of the responses (such as chills, pleasure,
changes in self-conception)? what features of aesthetic objects and
artworks tend to elicit these responses (such as curvature, certain
colors, etc.)? are there systematic individual differences in relation
to this?</em> Whereas experimental philosophy of art and
aesthetics&mdash;as a branch of philosophy&mdash;is primarily
concerned with empirically studying conceptual distinctions. It
answers questions such as: <em>do people think that a moral demerit
can also be an aesthetic demerit? do people think that something can
be art if it does not have any aesthetically valuable properties? what
is the nature of the folk&rsquo;s concept of art and beauty&mdash;are
they purely descriptive or evaluative concepts?</em></p>

<p>
Nonetheless, it is important to stress that, at best, this way of
carving up the distinction picks out a central tendency of the two
fields. In reality, the work done by researchers in philosophy,
including experimental philosophical aesthetics, and empirical
aesthetics overlaps in many ways. To give a few examples. Philosophers
have had a longstanding concern in trying to establish whether there
is a distinctive kind of aesthetic state of mind, and empirical
aestheticians have recently become interested in this question. A
couple of influential ideas about this from philosophy are that the
pleasure taken in beauty is of a disinterested kind, where this
roughly means that it is not the result of desire satisfaction, or
does not essentially produce desires (see Kant 1790); and that
approaching objects aesthetically involves adopting a distanced
attitude where we disengage from the object practically, and do not
relate it to our standing desires or interests (Bullough 1912). More
recently, empirical aestheticians have attempted to tackle this issue
with the tools provided by neuroscience and psychology. For example,
Marcus Nadal and Martin Skov (2018) have argued against the idea that
there is a distinctive <em>sui generis</em> state of mind, on the
grounds that, for example, the same neural hardware that is involved
in responding to pleasant tasting food and sex have been shown to be
involved in the appreciation of aesthetic objects. By contrast, Amy
Belfi and colleagues (2019), for example, have shown that aesthetic
appreciation involves activation of the Default Mode Network, which
they suggest may show that self-reflection, rather than
self-detachment, may form part of what makes aesthetic responses
unique. Philosophers have also been interested in explaining beauty in
terms of a harmony between the beautiful objects and our psychological
faculties in some ways (as present in, for example, Hume 1757a and
Kant 1790), and psychologists have sought to explain aesthetic appeal
in terms of processing characteristics, such as the fluency with which
an object is experienced (Reber et al. 2004). Both experimental
philosophers as well as aesthetic psychologists have tried to
elucidate the features of moral actions and traits that lead to
attributions of beauty, as well as the kind of psychological state
appreciation of this kind of beauty gives rise to (see, for example,
Doran 2023; see
 <a href="#MorAes">&sect;6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Unfortunately, notwithstanding the many overlapping concerns, the
fields of philosophical aesthetics (including experimental
philosophical aesthetics) and empirical aesthetics have remained
largely siloed. On the side of philosophical aestheticians, this has
continued to lead to missed opportunities for testing the empirical
aspects of their theories and for experimental philosophical
aestheticians to methodologically innovate. And on the side of
empirical aestheticians, this has led to a failure to benefit from the
theoretical and argumentative sophistication that tends to be
characteristic of the best work in philosophy. However, there are
signs that this is changing. Empirical aestheticians are increasingly
attempting to test claims drawn from philosophy (for example,
Brielmann &amp; Pelli 2017; Winner 2019), and experimental
philosophers of art and aestheticians are increasingly working with
psychologists, if not empirical aestheticians yet (for example,
Humbert-Droz et al. 2020). Nowhere is this more clear than in the case
of work on awe and the sublime, where philosophers have worked
productively with psychologists, and where philosophical claims have
informed the design of empirical studies and the resultant theory
building in turn (for example, Clewis 2021; Keltner &amp; Haidt 2003;
Shiota et al. 2007; Arcangeli et al. 2020; Shapshay 2021).</p>

<h2 id="DefArt">2. Definition of Art</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;What is art?&rdquo; stands as one of the central questions in
philosophical aesthetics. In fact, we can ask different questions
about the concept of art. First, we may ask about its extension:
<em>which works count as art?</em> Second, we may ask about its
intensional structure: <em>are there conditions necessary and
sufficient for a work to count as art?</em> Third, we may ask about
its function: <em>is calling a work &lsquo;art&rsquo; a praise, or
merely a classification?</em> Since many philosophers of art agree
that the definition of art should be compatible with art practices and
the way ordinary people think about art, unsurprisingly, it was also
one of the first questions in aesthetics to be empirically
investigated.</p>

<p>
Which works count as art? In his first empirical study on intuitions
about the extension of the concept of art, Richard Kamber (2011)
presented participants with a large number of descriptions and images
of objects and asked whether they would classify these objects as art.
The main focus of this study was putting to test prominent
 <a href="../art-definition/">definitions of art</a>:
 aesthetic definitions claim that art is created with an intention to
be aesthetically appreciated; institutional definitions claim that art
is created by an artist and presented to an artworld; and historical
definitions claim that art is created with an intention to belong to
the same set of objects as previously created works of art.
Kamber&rsquo;s approach was to examine a variety of &ldquo;hard
cases&rdquo; discussed in the aesthetics literature, such as objects
of low aesthetic value and objects that were made prior to social
art-making practices. He concluded that none of the art theories
succeed in fully tracking people&rsquo;s intuitions about the various
hard cases, but the <em>aesthetic definition of art</em>, which holds
an artwork to be an object created with an intention to provide people
with aesthetic experiences, was somewhat more successful than others.
In a follow-up study, Kamber and Taylor Enoch (2019) also asked
participants to justify their decisions of what is art by selecting
some of fourteen possible reasons, which included those that
emphasized intentional creation, the creator&rsquo;s consciousness,
beauty or evoking imaginative experiences. In this study,
justifications involving intentionality were the most often chosen.
Nevertheless, this study again indicated that none of the main
definitions of art fully aligned with what the study participants,
predominantly art professionals or art lovers, found intuitive.</p>

<p>
However, these studies have received some criticism. While Annelies
Monser&eacute; (2015) is sympathetic to Kamber&rsquo;s criticism of
philosophers&rsquo; reliance on intuitions in defining art, she is
equally skeptical of reliance on ordinary people&rsquo;s intuitions.
Instead, she advocates for a more indirect role for intuitions, on
which they are not used to directly justify any specific definition of
art, but as elucidations of how the concept gets invoked in practice.
Ellen Winner (2019: 21) notes that Kamber &ldquo;designed his study
very informally, testing a grab bag of theories, using only one or two
examples to test each one&rdquo;, and that it might benefit from a
more sensitive measure than a dichotomous choice of &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
or &lsquo;no&rsquo;, as was used.</p>

<p>
Although neither folk nor expert intuitions strictly require a work to
have high aesthetic value for it to be classified as art, more
beautiful (or more <em>liked</em>&mdash;a more common concept in the
psychological literature, which nowadays tends to steer clear of
discussions of beauty) works do tend to be classified as art more
often. Matthew Pelowski and colleagues (2017) investigated the
relationship between ratings of liking and attributions of art status.
Participants were shown a set of 140 digital images of abstract
paintings, hyperrealistic paintings, poorly-executed paintings and
ready-made sculptures, and were asked to spontaneously classify them
as &lsquo;art&rsquo; or &lsquo;not art&rsquo;. They were also asked to
rate the extent to which they liked those images. Pelowski&rsquo;s
findings revealed a positive correlation where higher ratings of
liking were associated with a greater likelihood of being categorized
as art, which provides some support for the aesthetic definitions of
art.</p>

<p>
Can art be defined by necessary and sufficient conditions at all?
Elz&#279; Mikalonyt&#279; and Markus Kneer (forthcoming) investigate
whether the folk concept of art is an essentialist or a
non-essentialist one; in other words, whether it can be defined by a
set of individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions. In
contrast to Kamber&rsquo;s studies mentioned earlier, they asked
people who were not art professionals. In two vignette studies,
Mikalonyt&#279; and Kneer manipulated three properties of
artworks&mdash;namely, being intentionally created, having aesthetic
value, and being institutionally recognized&mdash;aiming to see
whether any of those properties, corresponding to the main
essentialist art definitions, are seen by the folk as necessary
conditions for an object to be classified an artwork. The results,
similar to Kamber&rsquo;s, also suggest that the folk concept of art
is not an essentialist concept, but rather a cluster concept.
Interestingly, none of the three properties were considered
necessary&mdash;there were cases where art status was ascribed even to
accidentally created objects. This finding is surprising considering
the role that intentional creation and the creator&rsquo;s intentions
are thought to play in this context in the literature on philosophical
aesthetics (Mag Uidhir 2013), as well as some studies in the
psychology of art. For example, Jean-Luc Jucker et al. (2014)
discovered that when people are asked to classify artefacts into art
and non-art, their decisions are guided by inferences about the
creator&rsquo;s intentions. George Newman and Paul Bloom&rsquo;s
(2012) results showed that participants&rsquo; beliefs about whether
an object was intended to be an artwork or not had an important effect
on how they see a physically identical copy of the same object. More
generally, it is widely believed that people classify objects into
artefact kinds by making inferences about the creator&rsquo;s
intentions (Bloom 1996). Mikalonyt&#279; and Kneer&rsquo;s study,
however, is not the only one showing that intentional creation is not
seen by the folk as necessary&mdash;they have also discovered that
although people consider AI-generated paintings to be art to a similar
extent as human-created paintings, they are not very willing to
consider AI-creators artists. In the context of artistic creation,
mental state (including intention) ascription to AI agents is
relatively low, and this might partially explain why AI robots are not
accepted as artists (Mikalonyt&#279; &amp; Kneer 2022). However,
another study by Mikalonyt&#279; and Kneer suggests that the
phenomenon of art without an artistic intention might not be confined
to the realm of AI-generated art: even human creators are seen as
capable of creating artworks without intending to do so
(Mikalonyt&#279; &amp; Kneer forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Is calling a work &lsquo;art&rsquo; to praise it, or to merely
classify it? Shen-yi Liao, Aaron Meskin, and Joshua Knobe (2020) take
a different tactic to understand the concept of art. Their aim is not
to uncover its extension, or to defend any specific concept of art,
but to clarify its nature. Descriptivists about the concept of art
contend that to call something &lsquo;art&rsquo; merely conveys a
classificatory status, whereas evaluativists contend that to do so is
to convey a positive evaluation. Liao, Knobe, and Meskin use
linguistic patterns to argue that the concept of art is neither.
Instead, it is a &ldquo;dual character concept&rdquo;, which involves
characteristic values that are realized by concrete features (Knobe,
Prasada, &amp; Newman 2013). To diagnose the nature of the concept of
art and other art concepts, they examine participant responses to
sentences of the following schema:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That is not good, but it is true [concept].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Extant research shows that dual character concepts, but not
descriptive concepts, tend to sound fine when combined with the
&ldquo;true&rdquo; modifier (Knobe, Prasada, &amp; Newman 2013). So,
for merely descriptive concepts, the sentence makes little sense. For
example, it sounds weird to say &ldquo;that is a true sonnet&rdquo;.
Moreover, for positive evaluative concepts, the sentence also makes
little sense because of the explicit negative evaluation. For example,
it sounds weird to say &ldquo;that masterpiece is not good&rdquo;.
Since participants think that the sentence &ldquo;that is not good,
but it is true art&rdquo; sounds fine, Liao, Meskin, and Knobe argue
that the concept of art is neither descriptive nor evaluative, but
dual character.</p>

<h2 id="OntArt">3. Ontology of Art</h2>

<p>
Ontology of art (see entry on
 <a href="../art-ontology-history/">history of the ontology of art</a>)
 aims to discover what kind of things works of art are, which
ontological category or categories they belong to, whether it is
possible and what it means to create or destroy them, and what it
means for two different objects to be &lsquo;the same&rsquo; work.
Works of art can be divided into two categories: repeatable and
non-repeatable. The former category consists of musical works and
other kinds of works that exist in multiple instantiations. The latter
category consists of singular works of art where there is only one
original instance of that work and all others are merely copies of the
original, for example, paintings or sculptures. This distinction also
has implications for the way people evaluate work of art.</p>

<p>
For repeatable artworks, the most pressing ontological question
concerns the conditions under which two performances are of the same
work. Christopher Bartel (2018) investigated intuitions on the
repeatability of pop songs. He presented study participants with three
scenarios describing three pairs of musical performances, with each of
these pairs reflecting one of the following differences: a difference
in provenance (two identically sounding performances are played by two
different bands), in affect (one performance sounding humble, and one
sounding dramatic), and in connotation (the two performances are
played by different bands, with different lyrics and expressive of
different emotions). Bartel found that a difference in provenance does
not make a difference to whether the song is identical across
different performances, but differences in affect and in connotation
do.</p>

<p>
Elz&#279; Mikalonyt&#279; and Vilius Dranseika (2020) focused on works
of classical music. They created scenarios that reflected the main
points of disagreement among theories of the individuation of musical
works, such as sonicism (which claims that identity of musical works
depends on their acoustic properties only), instrumentalism (which
also adds the instrument used to perform the musical work to the list
of identity-conferring properties), and contextualism (which also
emphasizes the importance of musico-historical context). In contrast
to many other studies, Mikalonyt&#279; and Dranseika target intuitions
about the identity of two performances <em>at the same point in
time</em>. They presented the participants with seven scenarios,
including, for example, two identically sounding performances of two
identical scores which were independently created by two composers, or
two performances that differ only with respect to their emotional
expressivity. They concluded that folk intuitions correspond most with
<em>pure sonicism</em>, the theory which claims that work identity
depends solely on its (non-timbral) acoustic properties, although the
identity of the composer is also an important factor. While Bartel
concludes that pop music songs are not easily repeatable&mdash;in many
cases, participants were inclined to deny that two performances were
of the same song&mdash;Mikalonyt&#279; and Dranseika&rsquo;s study
points in the opposite direction: people consider works of classical
music to be quite easily repeatable.</p>

<p>
Nemesio Puy (2022) has criticized this approach for relying solely on
textual vignettes, lacking real musical stimuli (for more on this
discussion, see
 <a href="#MetDeb">section 8</a>).
 Puy&rsquo;s experiments show that, compared to Bartel (2018) and
Mikalonyt&#279; and Dranseika (2020), when study participants have the
chance to hear musical works, they are even more likely to answer the
individuation (or repeatability) question in the sonicist way. This
tendency is especially apparent if the question is asked immediately
after hearing two musical samples, without any contextual information
being provided.</p>

<p>
Two more empirical studies in this area of inquiry investigate
people&rsquo;s intuitions regarding the <em>persistence</em> of
musical works&mdash;in other words, their identity over time.
Mikalonyt&#279; and Dranseika (2022) explored the hypothesis that
musical works&rsquo; identity crucially depends on their purposes:
different versions of a musical work remain versions <em>of the same
work</em> if and only if they retain the same overall point they were
created for. Their results provide some support for this hypothesis,
but purpose was not considered to be a necessary condition. Again,
this study shows that people have mostly sonicist
intuitions&mdash;they believe that the identity of musical works
mostly depends on their acoustic properties, and this is considered to
be a much more important criterion in judgments of identity compared
to the overall purpose of the work as intended by the composer.</p>

<p>
Elz&#279; Mikalonyt&#279; and Cl&eacute;ment Canonne (forthcoming)
found that judgments of the identity of artworks&mdash;both musical
works and paintings&mdash;are partially normative. Their results
provide some support for the Phineas Gage effect&mdash;according to
which, changes in valued qualities, and especially moral properties,
change identity judgments&mdash;suggesting that if a musical work
undergoes some changes and becomes more aesthetically valuable, people
are more likely to say that it is still the same musical work compared
to the condition when the musical work becomes less aesthetically
valuable. However, the effect observed was easily overridden by
changes in material identity or moral value and for this reason it
does not seem sufficient to claim that musical works are essentialized
in terms of their aesthetic value.</p>

<p>
All of the empirical studies in the ontology of musical works so far
have focused on their identity conditions. Many other topics remain
unexplored by experimental philosophers, such as the way musical works
come into existence and cease to exist. An overview of such topics and
a systematic survey of philosophers&rsquo; appeals to ordinary
intuitions regarding musical works is presented in Mikalonyt&#279;
(2022), where she also discusses how the ontology of musical works
could benefit from further empirical research.</p>

<p>
Unlike repeatable artworks that can have many genuine and potentially
equally valuable instances, other works of art, such as paintings or
sculptures, can only have one physical object. The relationship
between different instances of these artworks is of copy and original,
where only one physical object can count as a given artwork. This has
important implications both for identity judgments and aesthetic
evaluation.</p>

<p>
Given that many non-repeatable artworks share similarities with
ordinary, non-artistic artefacts, it is helpful to compare studies
that explore the role of material continuity in judgments of
<em>artefact</em> and <em>artwork</em> persistence. Sergey Blok,
George Newman, and Lance Rips (2005) investigated people&rsquo;s
intuitions about the persistence of various types of objects,
including persons, animals, plants, and artefacts. Participants were
presented with a vignette about each of these objects either (a) being
disassembled into individual particles, transported and reassembled
again, or (b) being replaced by an identical material copy, the
original of which is destroyed. People were inclined to see artefacts
as the same after being &lsquo;copied&rsquo;. In a related study,
David Rose and colleagues (2020) have investigated intuitions about
the Ship of Theseus puzzle across different cultures. Their results
suggest that people are ambivalent about whether it is the continuity
of form or the continuity of material that is decisive in matters of
identity. Results of both studies suggest that material identity might
not be the main criterion for judgments of persistence of artefactual
objects. However, extant empirical research suggests that judgments of
the persistence of artworks are different from those of other
artefacts. When presented with a scenario about someone creating a
copy of either an artwork or of a tool and destroying the original
object, people are not willing to see the copy as &lsquo;the
same&rsquo; object, even if the only difference between the tool and
the artwork is labeling them as such (Newman, Bartels, &amp; Smith
2014).</p>

<p>
Some philosophers, such as Arthur Danto (1973), claim that a copy of a
non-repeatable artwork is always aesthetically less valuable.
Empirical research also suggests that people tend to value a copy of
an artwork less than the original, even if the two are perceptually
indistinguishable (Rabb, Brownell, &amp; Winner 2018). George Newman
has conducted a series of studies to explain this effect. One possible
reason is that the created object is evaluated as the result of a
unique creative act; another is that there is a perceived physical
contact between the object and the original creator (Newman &amp;
Bloom 2012). When a duplicate object is made by someone other than the
original creator, people are less inclined to see it as the same
object (Newman, Bartels, &amp; Smith 2014). Since people believe that
an object&rsquo;s or person&rsquo;s essence can be transferred by
means of physical contact, Newman and Smith (2019)
hypothesized&mdash;and confirmed&mdash;that differences in evaluation
between a copy and an original painting are mediated by the
artwork&rsquo;s perceived anthropomorphism; that is, feelings that the
artwork seems alive and expresses emotions. In some cases, physical
contact is not necessary for beliefs in contagion: intentional contact
may be enough (Stavrova et al. 2016). Shen-yi Liao, Aaron Meskin, and
Jade Fletcher (2020) examined the contagion effect in the museum
context. They asked the participants (a) whether the objects in the
gallery embody &ldquo;the very being&rdquo; of their creator, and (b)
whether they are unique, and they found that contagion has an effect
on perceived aesthetic value both in the museum and laboratory
context, while uniqueness matters only in the latter.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is one more way aesthetic information has an effect on
ontological judgments, even if this kind of research does not speak
directly to the ontology of <em>art</em>: aesthetic preferences may
influence judgments of personal identity. Previously, it had been
thought that we consider humans and their &lsquo;true selves&rsquo; to
be fundamentally <em>morally</em> good, and that changes to
someone&rsquo;s moral character influence judgments of a
person&rsquo;s identity. Joerg Fingerhut and colleagues discovered
that changes in our aesthetic taste are also seen as profoundly
transformative changes: when someone&rsquo;s aesthetic preferences
change, they cease to be <em>the same</em> person (Fingerhut et al.
2021).</p>

<h2 id="AesJud">4. Aesthetic Judgments</h2>

<p>
A particularly fruitful area of experimental philosophical research
has centered around the question of how objective our
 <a href="../aesthetic-judgment/">aesthetic judgments</a>
 
<!--pdf include (see entry) pdf include--> are, and related issues
such as the possibility of
 <a href="../aesthetic-testimony/">aesthetic testimony</a>.
 This has principally been done by either examining meta-aesthetic
intuitions, or by examining the amount of agreement in aesthetic
matters, and the source of this agreement.</p>

<p>
With respect to the issue of objectivity, many philosophical
aestheticians have thought that aesthetic judgments intend to express
truths about the way the world is, and that some people have better
access to these truths than others. David Hume (1757a) suggests that
some people are better able to detect and weigh the aesthetic merits
of a work than others&mdash;they have delicate taste&mdash;and that
works that are reliably appreciated over time and across cultures are
those which are truly good. Immanuel Kant (1790) suggests that while
our judgments of beauty are based in pleasure, they command universal
agreement&mdash;that is, we expect others to make the same judgments
as us. In this respect, aesthetic judgments have been thought to be
<em>unlike</em> statements of personal taste, such as &lsquo;broccoli
is delicious&rsquo;, about which there can only be blameless
disagreement; and <em>like</em> empirical judgments, such as
&lsquo;there is a piece of broccoli on my plate&rsquo;, about which
there can be genuine disagreement. Indeed, some have thought that the
way <em>the folk</em> act presupposes such a realist conception of
aesthetic judgments, with No&euml;l Carroll (1999), Nick Zangwill
(2005), and Peter Kivy (2015) noting that we argue with each other
about aesthetic matters.</p>

<p>
Taking this as a starting point, a number of psychologists and
experimental philosophers have presented findings that suggest realism
cannot be given special status as the commonsensical view, and
philosophical accounts of aesthetic judgments do not need to
accommodate realist intuitions. This line of research started with
Geoffrey Goodwin and John Darley (2008), who asked people to determine
whether comparative aesthetic judgments&mdash;such as
&lsquo;Shakespeare was a better writer than Dan
Brown&rsquo;&mdash;were true, false, or a matter of opinion. Most
participants described aesthetic statements as opinions (despite the
strength of agreement with each statement) and they did this more
frequently than in the case of comparable moral, factual statements,
or statements reflecting social conventions.</p>

<p>
Then, in a series of studies led by Florian Cova, the folk&rsquo;s
meta-aesthetical views were further tested by presenting participants
with an aesthetic disagreement&mdash;such as where someone finds a
sunset beautiful and the other does not&mdash;between two
interlocutors (or between the participant and an interlocutor), and
asking participants whether one person is correct, both are correct,
or neither is correct. Across different kinds of objects (including
natural objects and art widely recognized to be beautiful, as well as
objects that study participants <em>personally</em> find beautiful),
type of aesthetic judgments (including judgments of beauty and
ugliness), and across a wide range of different countries, it has been
found that most select the option &ldquo;Neither is correct&rdquo;
(Cova &amp; Pain 2012; Cova, Olivola, et al. 2019; for further studies
utilizing the disagreement method, see Andow 2022).</p>

<p>
Returning to the comparative method, Nathaniel Rabb, Alex Han, and
colleagues (2022) have presented further evidence against the idea
that the folk are aesthetic realists by explicitly asking participants
whether aesthetic judgments are matters of opinion or matters of fact.
They showed that people believe that aesthetic judgments are
subjective even after learning that one of the two works has been
historically acclaimed, or even when they liked one artwork much more
than another (though, for criticisms of this study, see Moss &amp;
Bush 2021).</p>

<p>
Supporters of the presumption in favor of realism have, however,
fought back. Zangwill (2019) argues that Cova and his
colleagues&rsquo; studies are not about whether people think aesthetic
judgments can be true or false, but rather about whether a given
person is right or wrong, and so leave the presumption in favor of
realism unscathed. The distinction Zangwill is aiming at is as
follows: Someone who guesses correctly that it is raining outside
would be saying something true when they say that &ldquo;it is raining
outside&rdquo;, but they cannot be described as <em>right</em>. Being
right is a matter of being justified in saying something. In
addressing Zangwill&rsquo;s critique, in the same design where
participants are asked to consider an interlocutor disagreeing with
them in making various kinds of judgments, including aesthetic
judgments, Cova (2019) asked participants whether one, both or neither
person said something true or false. The results here were quite
different from those of the studies conducted to date: with the modal
response being that only one person says something true (40%),
followed closely by the response that says that both say something
true (39%). Despite these differences, Cova suggests that these do not
support the idea that the folk tend to be realists about aesthetic
judgment on the grounds that the pattern of responses did not match
the pattern for paradigmatic factual judgements (that is, a
disagreement about whether something is steel, where 71% of
participants selected the response that only one person said something
true).</p>

<p>
A further objection has been raised to this work on folk
meta-aesthetics by Filippo Contesi and colleagues (2024). They point
out that all the studies discussed above reveal that the folk&rsquo;s
<em>explicit</em> meta-aesthetic views are subjectivist, and that this
is consistent with what supporters of aesthetic realism say. These
supporters&mdash;such as Carroll (1999), Zangwill (2005), and Kivy
(2015)&mdash;claim that the folk are implicitly realist in arguing
about matters of taste, even if they hold explicit subjectivist
attitudes, as expressed by hackneyed proverbs such as
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no accounting for taste&rdquo;. As such, Contesi
and colleagues suggest that Cova&rsquo;s results are inconclusive, and
that disproving folk aesthetic realism as it has been conceived of by
realists to support the plausibility of their position would require a
different methodological approach.</p>

<p>
Turning away from critiques of aesthetic realism to positive accounts
of folk meta-aesthetics, experimental philosophers have also suggested
that folk meta-aesthetical views might nonetheless allow for some
degree of objectivity, and have found that the concept of good taste
might behave differently from that of aesthetic truth.</p>

<p>
Cova (2019) suggests that the folk might be expressivists about
aesthetic judgments, and that they may think that there can
nonetheless be correctness conditions for aesthetic judgments, insofar
as people can, for example, be mistaken about the cause of the
feelings they express. In one study to begin to test this position,
Cova presented participants with a case where someone judges the
Eiffel tower to be beautiful as a result of being high on drugs, or as
a result of seeing the Eiffel tower unimpaired. The results reveal
that participants were less likely to say that a judgment of beauty
was true and more likely to say that the judgment was false when the
experience was the result of drugs. Similarly, across five studies
that manipulated the type of disagreement (cross-cultural or
intercultural, or internal disagreement of one individual over time)
and asked participants about the possibility of error in aesthetic
judgments, James Andow (2022) found that while people do not hold
realist beliefs, they do believe that they have correctness conditions
(though see Murray 2020 for results suggesting that people do not
think that disagreement implies that they are seen as incorrect).</p>

<p>
Moreover, although most studies on aesthetic judgments point in the
direction of subjectivism, research on aesthetic taste suggests that
people believe aesthetic taste <em>can</em> be good or bad. Constant
Bonard et al. (2022) asked participants whether it makes sense to
distinguish between good and bad taste, and then asked to define what
it is. The majority of participants agreed with the distinction, and
although a significant part defined good taste in terms of the ability
to detect aesthetic properties, expressing the view compatible with
aesthetic realism, for other participants, good taste was compatible
with aesthetic subjectivism, since &lsquo;good taste&rsquo; was
defined simply as something corresponding to their own personal
preferences. Another phenomenon that has been thought to be relevant
to the issue of whether good taste exists, is that of &lsquo;guilty
pleasures&rsquo;&mdash;enjoying aesthetic objects one feels one should
not enjoy. As Kris Goffin and Florian Cova (2019) observe, the
existence of guilty pleasure at first sight might be considered
evidence for the existence of good taste among the folk. However, they
present evidence suggesting that the guilt people experience should be
understood as guilt for violating social norms, not aesthetic ones,
and therefore should not be seen as evidence for folk aesthetic
realism.</p>

<p>
In addition to the meta-aesthetical method outlined above,
psychologists and experimental philosophers have also examined realism
about taste by considering the mechanisms that result in
people&rsquo;s aesthetic judgments.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers have suggested that the idea that there be objective
aesthetic value might be demonstrated simply by pointing to the fact
that some artworks and not others are universally judged as
aesthetically valuable. For example, Hume (1757a) suggests that some
works are, truly, better than others, and that those works will pass
the test of time: they will be judged to be good across cultures and
epochs, and they will do this in virtue of truly having aesthetically
good-making features.</p>

<p>
However, James Cutting (2003) has presented evidence that has seemed
to put pressure on this Humean view. Having found that merely exposing
people to impressionist works made them like them more, Cutting
suggests that we may like canonical works because they have been
continually broadcast to the world. Armed with Cutting&rsquo;s
findings, the aesthetic skeptic might argue that passing the test of
time isn&rsquo;t an indication of aesthetic quality, but rather an
indication that people have merely experienced the works more
frequently.</p>

<p>
In defense of the Humean view, Meskin et al. (2013) suggest that mere
exposure might not indiscriminately improve liking of works,
irrespective of their aesthetic quality; but rather, help us to more
accurately appreciate their true aesthetic merits and demerits. As a
corollary, they also suggest that works may enter the canon because
they are truly better. Putting their Humean defense to the test, they
merely exposed participants to works that the authors and many critics
consider good and bad (namely, works by John Millais and Thomas
Kinkade, respectively). The results revealed that participants liked
the Kinkade paintings <em>less</em> the more they were exposed to
them, and the results suggested a trend for participants to like the
late Millais paintings <em>more</em> the more they were exposed to
them (though this was not significant). Meskin and colleagues
interpret this evidence as consistent with the existence of aesthetic
value, as well as the reliability of the test of time: with repeated
exposure, we are better able to appraise a work&rsquo;s good- and
bad-making features, and so those works that endure do so, at least in
part, in virtue of having good-making features.</p>

<p>
Bence Nanay (2017) has criticized the idea that mere exposure is
relevant to aesthetic realism. First, studies on mere exposure target
spontaneous reactions, while aesthetic judgments are traditionally
thought to be reflective and unfolding in time. Secondly, the mere
exposure effect seems to work only with good artworks and not with bad
ones&mdash;exposure to good artworks makes positive aesthetic
judgments more likely, but not the other way around. Most importantly,
according to Nanay, experiments show that exposure to one artwork
changes our preference for <em>that particular</em> artwork, but not
for any other artwork. In order for these experiments to count as
evidence against aesthetic realism, Nanay contends, we would need to
demonstrate that exposure to one particular artwork can influence our
preferences for other artworks of the same kind (for example, of the
same artistic style).</p>

<p>
Finally, another tightly related question is about the nature of
aesthetic testimony: if our aesthetic judgments are similar to
empirical judgments, we can reliably learn about aesthetic properties
from what other people say&mdash;if during a phone call someone says
that a piece of broccoli they are having for lunch &lsquo;is
beautiful&rsquo;, should we trust their testimony to the same extent
that we would trust their claim that &lsquo;there is a piece of
broccoli on my plate&rsquo;?</p>

<p>
Andow (2019) asked his study participants whether they think that
forming aesthetic beliefs based on testimony given by a friend or an
expert is less <em>permissible</em> and <em>legitimate</em> compared
to forming such beliefs based on first-hand experience, and also
compared to forming non-aesthetic beliefs, such as beliefs about size
or price. Although his results confirm that there is an asymmetry
between the extent to which people are inclined to trust aesthetic
testimony, compared to testimony about non-aesthetic properties,
interestingly, this effect was not moderated by the
participants&rsquo; attitudes toward the status of aesthetic
judgments. Moreover, another similarly designed study shows that
aesthetic and moral beliefs based on testimony, in contrast to
descriptive beliefs, are not seen as constituting <em>knowledge</em>
(Andow 2020).</p>

<h2 id="AesAdj">5. Aesthetic Adjectives</h2>

<p>
<em>Aesthetic adjectives</em>, such as &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; and
&lsquo;elegant&rsquo;, are central to aesthetic communication: they
are the most common tools with which we attribute aesthetic properties
to works and communicate aesthetic judgments with others. Some
philosophers contend that aesthetic adjectives constitute a segment of
natural language that is interesting in its own right, for different
reasons. Frank Sibley (1959, 2001) argues that aesthetic adjectives
are distinctive in that they require taste to apply. By this, Sibley
means that whether an aesthetic adjective applies to a work is never
determined by any set of non-aesthetic properties. Tim Sundell (2017)
argues that although aesthetic adjectives are not semantically
distinctive, they are metalinguistically distinctive because of their
role in coordinating and negotiating standards. By this, Sundell means
that when you say &lsquo;this artwork is beautiful&rsquo; and I say
&lsquo;no it is not&rsquo;, we are not only attributing properties to
the work itself, but communicating our different standards of beauty
through our different applications of the term
&lsquo;beautiful&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
There is a nearby segment of natural language that has attracted much
attention from philosophers and linguists: <em>predicates of personal
taste</em> such as &lsquo;tasty&rsquo; and &lsquo;fun&rsquo;. Indeed,
some experimental philosophers have made valuable contributions to
this debate (such as Kneer, Vicente, &amp; Zeman 2017; Dinges &amp;
Zakkou 2020; Kneer 2021). However, scholars in this debate typically
set aesthetic adjectives to the side in their investigations. For
example, Peter Lasersohn (2005: 645) explicitly does so in order to
avoid fundamental issues in aesthetics. In contrast to the lively
scholarly activity on predicates of personal taste, there are only a
few works that explicitly and primarily investigate aesthetic
adjectives. As such, it remains an open question whether aesthetic
adjectives are distinct from predicates of personal taste, or whether
there exists a unified treatment of the two.</p>

<p>
Louise McNally and Isidora Stojanovic (2017) argue that while
predicates of personal taste are necessarily mind-dependent insofar as
they entail an experiencer, aesthetic adjectives are semantically
distinctive because they express evaluations without entailing an
experiencer. McNally and Stojanovic&rsquo;s diagnostic appeals to the
fact that the verb &lsquo;find&rsquo; tends to complement adjectives
with an experiencer. For example, sentences like &lsquo;I find him
attractive&rsquo; tend to sound fine but sentences like &lsquo;I find
him tall&rsquo; tend to sound weird. Using the British National
Corpus, they found that aesthetic adjectives do not tend to complement
&lsquo;find&rsquo;, which they take to be evidence that &ldquo;their
evaluative component is not based directly on personal
experience&rdquo; (2017: 29).</p>

<p>
Shen-yi Liao and Aaron Meskin (2017) argue that aesthetic adjectives
are semantically distinctive because they exhibit a strange sort of
context-sensitivity. Standardly, gradable adjectives are classified as
absolute or relative. Absolute adjectives&mdash;such as
&lsquo;straight&rsquo; or &lsquo;spotted&rsquo;&mdash;have their
standards of application built in, and do not rely on the context to
fix this threshold. By contrast, relative adjectives&mdash;such as
&lsquo;warm&rsquo; or &lsquo;long&rsquo;&mdash;do rely on a context
for its threshold of application. Through a series of experiments
involving a diagnostic used to classify gradable adjectives, Liao and
Meskin found that aesthetic adjectives behaved like neither absolute
nor relative adjectives. Participants were presented with pairs of
objects and asked to pick out &lsquo;the [adjective] one&rsquo;. The
key to this diagnostic is that &lsquo;the&rsquo; implies both
existence (there is at least one) and uniqueness (there is at most
one). As such, most participants are unable to pick out <em>the</em>
spotted disc when presented with two discs that are spotted to
different degrees because &lsquo;spotted&rsquo;, as an absolute
adjective, has a context-insensitive threshold of application which is
met in both cases. By contrast, most participants are able to pick out
<em>the</em> long rod when presented with two rods that are long to
different degrees because &lsquo;long&rsquo;, as a relative adjective,
has a threshold of application that is sensitive to the context. In
particular, participants are able to construct an implicit comparison
class using the context of application: they pick out the
long<em>er</em> rod as &lsquo;the long one&rsquo;. However, Liao and
Meskin found that about half of the participants use
&lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; like &lsquo;spotted&rsquo; and about half of
the participants use &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; like &lsquo;long&rsquo;.
Moreover, the same pattern holds also for negative aesthetic
adjectives like &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; and thick aesthetic adjectives like
&lsquo;elegant&rsquo;. These results are difficult to explain for the
standard typology of gradable adjectives.</p>

<p>
Stojanovic (2019) argues that Liao and Meskin&rsquo;s results do not
provide grounds for drawing any interesting conclusions regarding
semantic adjectives because the studies do not reveal a stable
pattern. The 50/50 pattern in response to the request to pick out
<em>the</em> beautiful / ugly / elegant object is just what would be
expected if participants were answering by chance. Liao, McNally, and
Meskin (2016) conducted further experiments and corpus observations to
show the instability of aesthetic adjectives&rsquo; behaviors. On some
diagnostics they pattern with absolute adjectives, but on other
diagnostics they pattern with relative adjectives. In response to
these results, they propose a different hypothesis: aesthetic
adjectives are like relative adjectives insofar as both involve
implicit comparison classes, but unlike relative adjectives insofar as
their implicit comparison classes are not determined by the immediate
context of application.</p>

<p>
Where the studies described above have attempted to treat aesthetic
adjectives as a homogeneous and <em>sui generis</em> class, more
recent studies have pointed to important sources of heterogeneity
amongst them. &lsquo;Beautiful&rsquo; and &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; are
similar adjectives in that they can both express certain descriptive
contents&mdash;namely, that an appearance is intrinsically pleasing,
or that it is, for example, delicate, small, and soft. But they differ
insofar as prettiness is thought to be more closely tied to
appearances and less important than beauty. In trying to account for
this patterning, Doran (forthcoming a) suggests that BEAUTY but not
PRETTINESS is a dual-character concept, and that in addition to the
descriptive senses they share, BEAUTY has a normative sense connected
to our most cherished values, including, most prominently, moral
goodness. In support of this claim, in one of the studies reported, he
shows that &lsquo;beauty&rsquo; but not &lsquo;prettiness&rsquo; is
judged to be able to felicitiously combine with the &lsquo;true&rsquo;
modifier, which is thought to be one source of evidence that the
concept expressed by a given lexical item is dual-character (Knobe et
al. 2013). &ldquo;That is true beauty&rdquo; sounds perfectly natural
to native speakers of English, but &ldquo;That is true
prettiness&rdquo; sounds decidedly odd.</p>

<h2 id="MorAes">6. Morality and Aesthetics</h2>

<p>
Morality and aesthetics stand as two prominent normative domains. How
do the concerns in these two domains interact with one another?
Drawing from a substantive philosophical literature on these
interactions (see Harold 2023 for overviews), topics at the
intersection have also been empirically investigated in recent years.
Here, we roughly divide works into two aspects: concerning
morality&rsquo;s influence on aesthetics, and concerning
aesthetics&rsquo; influence on morality.</p>

<p>
In the first direction, concerning morality&rsquo;s influence on
aesthetics, philosophers have wondered about the influence of moral
attitudes on aesthetic attitudes. In traditional philosophical
aesthetics, this is sometimes known as the &ldquo;value
interaction&rdquo; or &ldquo;ethical criticism of art&rdquo; debate
(Clavel V&aacute;zquez 2018; Giovanelli 2007; Liao &amp; Meskin 2018;
McGregor 2014). There are three main positions: autonomists say that
moral attitudes do not influence aesthetic attitudes; moralists say
that negative moral judgments always negatively influence aesthetic
judgments; and contextualists say that moral attitudes&rsquo;
influence on aesthetic attitudes depends on the context.</p>

<p>
This direction of value interaction might affect taste perception.
Patrik S&ouml;rqvist and colleagues (2013) found that, between two
qualitatively identical cups of coffee, participants whose attitudes
are congruent with sustainability rated the one labeled as
&ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; as tastier. However, Aaron Meskin and
Shen-yi Liao (2018) were unable to conceptually replicate this result.
Similarly, Beth Armstrong and colleagues (2019) found that the valence
of ethical information affected consumers&rsquo; expected experience
of food. Taken together, these results suggest that a folk psychology
of moralism or contextualism is currently more plausible than a folk
psychology of autonomism.</p>

<p>
This direction of value interaction might also affect judgments of
beauty. One longstanding debate in this context surrounds whether
moral goodness can be beautiful in itself&mdash;with philosophers such
as Plato (c. 370 BCE) and Shaftesbury (1711) claiming that moral
beauty exists, and others such as Edmund Burke (1757) and Immanuel
Kant (1790) denying this (though see Doran forthcoming d). Until
recently, one of the principal ways that philosophers have tried to
settle this matter is by examining the use of ordinary language from
the armchair. Berys Gaut (2007), for example, argues in favor of the
existence of moral beauty principally by noting that we <em>call</em>
people beautiful when they are good. Gaut argues that this kind of
talk cannot be intended non-literally, as was suggested by Burke
(1757), as neither of the two defeators of literal use&mdash;obvious
falsity (as in &lsquo;my boss is a pig&rsquo;) or trivial truthfulness
(as in &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not over the moon&rsquo;)&mdash;seem to apply
to locutions that appear to express moral beauty. But as Ryan Doran
(2021) notes, Gaut&rsquo;s method of testing for non-literal use is
too demanding, as it wrongly assumes that people are always
truth-maximisers. To move past this apparent impasse from the
armchair, and help to reveal the number of species of moral beauty
that exist, Doran suggests that we turn to experimental studies. He
shows that people tend to judge morally good people to be more
beautiful, and that this cannot be deflated in terms of non-literal
intent or an error (such as misattribution) on the grounds that making
the source of the goodness salient, and giving people the opportunity
to express their approval of the goodness prior to making the judgment
of beauty, does not eliminate the effect of moral goodness on
judgments of beauty. Doran also finds evidence that moral goodness can
affect the beauty of physical appearances by affecting the
determinants of thick aesthetic properties such as balance and
delicacy, and that people&rsquo;s moral character can be beautiful in
itself, suggesting that beauty is not perception dependent.</p>

<p>
Building on this work, experimental philosophy studies have also been
used to help resolve apparent inconsistencies in the existing
literature on <em>which</em> moral traits are beautiful, as well as
reveal hitherto unacknowledged reasons why morally good traits and
actions are beautiful, among other things.</p>

<p>
Supporters of moral beauty can be divided into <em>particularists</em>
about the beauty of traits&mdash;who tend to hold that only the
&lsquo;warmer&rsquo; virtues such as compassion are beautiful (for
example, Kant 1764)&mdash;and <em>universalists</em> about moral
beauty&mdash;who tend to argue that all virtues are beautiful, and
indeed that certain colder non-moral traits such as intelligence can
be beautiful too (Schiller 1793 [2003], 1793 [2005]; Gaut 2007; and
Paris 2018).</p>

<p>
Doran (2023) proposes that these positions only appear to be
inconsistent with one another, as they range over different kinds of
beauty: with universalists targeting the beauty that is found in good
form, and particularists targeting the kind of beauty that lies in
things that have a disposition to lead to an emotion that is variously
described as &lsquo;love,&rsquo; &lsquo;elevation&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ecstasy&rsquo;&mdash;which is characterized by feelings akin to
being moved, inspired, and of unity with the object of this state. To
test this view, he presented participants with a story about two
individuals who are equally well-formed&mdash;in the sense that their
mental states are all working harmoniously to lead them to do the
right thing&mdash;but differ in the kind of virtue they exhibit, with
one individual being just, and the other being compassionate.
Consistent with the idea that there is a beauty in some traits which
resides in the disposition to give rise to this special emotion in
addition to well-formedness, participants found the fully just and
fully compassionate individuals to be equally virtuous and good, but
the latter to be more beautiful to the extent that this individual
tended to give rise to this special emotion to a greater extent.</p>

<p>
Examining the link between internal harmony and beauty more
explicitly, Doran (forthcoming b) has tested the idea&mdash;which is
most prominently found in Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s <em>On Grace
&amp; Dignity</em> (1793 [2005]) and <em>Kallias</em> (1793
[2002])&mdash;that actions are beautiful if and only if they are
expressive of freedom by being the result of a high degree of internal
harmony, as in cases where our desires, beliefs, and will all
seamlessly work together to produce the good action. While Doran finds
some evidence which is consistent with actions being beautiful to the
extent that they are expressive of freedom by being the result of a
high degree of internal harmony, his results also suggest that the
moral actions of conflicted individuals can be <em>as</em> beautiful,
or even <em>more</em> beautiful, as those of internally harmonious
moral agents, and so Schiller&rsquo;s claim need to be weakened and
supplemented with additional claims. In one experiment, for example,
participants were presented with two individuals who both do the right
and good action in making necessary redundancies and giving financial
support to those affected, where the only difference is that where one
individual makes the redundancies without any internal conflict, the
other does so with a great deal of conflict due to a reluctance to
afflict the necessary suffering. Consistent with his earlier findings,
the results show that the latter individual&rsquo;s action is
considered to be more beautiful, and that this is due to the latter
individual&rsquo;s tendency to move us, and make us feel at one with
them. As such, Doran suggests that it is not only the internal harmony
of the agent who performs an action that determines its beauty, but
also the degree to which the action tends to make us <em>feel as
though we are harmoniously related to the agent that performs the
action</em>. Further elucidating some of the reasons why morally good
actions can be beautiful, Doran (forthcoming c) finds that people tend
to think that morally good actions are beautiful when the action is
seen as expressing who the person truly is (their essence), and as
stemming from a location deep inside of them, and in turn tends to
lead to feelings of being moved and inspired.</p>

<p>
Imagination may play an especially important role in mediating moral
attitudes&rsquo; influence on aesthetic attitudes. Imaginative
resistance refers to the phenomenon in which &ldquo;an otherwise
competent imaginer finds it difficult to engage in some sort of
prompted imaginative activity&rdquo; (Gendler &amp; Liao 2016: 405;
see also Miyazono &amp; Liao 2016). Imaginative resistance is puzzling
because imagination is standardly unconstrained. Typically, a
competent imaginer finds no difficulty in imagining <em>factual</em>
deviations, such as a fictional world in which humans and dragons
co-exist. However, it has been hypothesized that imaginative
activities that involve <em>moral</em> deviations are especially prone
to evoke imaginative resistance (Gendler 2000, 2006). For example, it
has been suggested that a fictional world in which female infanticide
is morally right is likely to evoke imaginative resistance (Walton
1994). Philosophers disagree about many aspects of imaginative
resistance, such as: whether the resistance is special to imagining
moral deviations, whether the resistance reflects an intrinsic
limitation of imagination, and indeed, whether the phenomenon is real
in the first place. Experimental philosophers and psychologists have
sought to bring systematic empirical evidence to help resolve these
disagreements.</p>

<p>
As an early example of this kind of work, Liao, Strohminger, and
Sripada (2014) conducted two studies on imaginative resistance and its
driving factors. In the first study, they asked participants to engage
with a story in the style of Greek myths, in which it is morally right
to trick a person into entering a romantic relationship. They found
evidence for imaginative resistance being a real phenomenon: the
extent to which this fictional world is counter to participants&rsquo;
moral attitude is correlated with the extent of their self-reported
imaginative difficulty. However, they also found evidence against the
resistance reflecting an intrinsic limitation of imagination: the
extent to which participants are familiar with the genre conventions
of Greek myths is also correlated with the extent of their
self-reported imaginative difficulty. In the second study, they
presented a fictional world in which it is morally right to sacrifice
an infant, but varied the genre of the story such that some
participants engaged with a story in the style of police procedurals
but others engaged with a story in the style of Aztec myths. Sure
enough, participants do have a harder time accepting that infant
sacrifice really is morally right in the police procedural world, but
an easier time accepting the same for the Aztec myth world. This
contrast found in this study (replicated by Mark Phelan and colleagues
in Cova, Strickland, et al. 2021) lends further support to the reality
and the non-intrinsicality of imaginative resistance.</p>

<p>
Subsequent investigations by other philosophers and psychologists have
found additional support for the reality of imaginative resistance and
further uncovered its contours. Jessica E. Black and Jennifer L.
Barnes (2017) have designed and validated a scale for measuring
imaginative resistance. With this scale, they have also found that
participants do experience imaginative resistance in response to moral
deviance, albeit with contextual and individual variations (Barnes
&amp; Black 2016; Black &amp; Barnes 2020). However, Hanna Kim, Markus
Kneer, and Mike Stuart (2019) found that the resistance is not special
to imagining moral deviations. Instead, imaginative resistance
reflects the &ldquo;weirdness&rdquo; of the claim that participants
are asked to imagine, which is itself an amalgam of three factors:
unusualness, counterfactuality, and surprisingness. Morally deviant
claims, as a class, are not necessarily more weird than factually
deviant claims, as a class. Moreover, given that surprisingness is a
component, weirdness depends on expectations which might be modified
by genre expectations and other contextual factors. Dylan Campbell,
William Kidder, Jason D&rsquo;Cruz, and Brendan Gaesser (2021) found
that the resistance does not reflect an intrinsic limitation of
imagination. Instead, imaginative resistance reflects individual
differences in emotional reactivity: participants who experience less
negative affect in response to harms also experience less difficulty
in imagining moral deviance.</p>

<p>
In the second direction, concerning aesthetics&rsquo; influence on
morality, philosophers have also wondered about the influence of
aesthetic attitudes on moral attitudes. This direction comes up too,
albeit much more rarely, in the &ldquo;value interaction&rdquo; debate
(Harold 2006; Stecker 2005). In psychology, however, aesthetic
attitudes&rsquo; influence on moral attitudes has been systematically
studied in an extensive literature on the beauty-is-good stereotype
(Dion et al. 1972; compare the metaanalyses in Eagly et al. 1991 and
Langlois et al. 2000). Roughly, the idea is that positive aesthetic
judgments always positively influence moral judgments of persons. This
stereotype holds in a surprisingly wide variety of domains, such as
pedagogy and politics.</p>

<p>
Philosophers have been equivocal in their answer to the question of
whether aesthetic appreciation has a salubrious effect on us morally.
Cynics about beauty have suggested that appreciating beauty might have
a corrupting influence. J. Robert Loftis (2003), for example, suggests
that beauty might lead us to focus on the superficial, &ldquo;skin
deep&rdquo;, features of the world. But some philosophers have been
more sanguine about the prospect of moral cultivation via beauty.
Plato, in the <em>Symposium</em>, suggests that the appreciation of
physical beauties leads to the appreciation of non-perceptual kinds of
goodness; and Kant (1785) suggests that a love of <em>natural</em>
beauty in particular is a &ldquo;mark of the good soul&rdquo;, and
indicates that a person is susceptible to the &ldquo;moral
feeling&rdquo;. Since this issue is an empirical one to an important
extent, it is perhaps no surprise that experimental philosophers and
empirical aestheticians have entered the fray. Providing correlational
support for the optimistic view, Diessner et al. (2013) found that the
tendency to be sensitive to beauty (that is, to notice it, and be
moved by it), and particularly sensitivity to natural beauty, was
associated with the moral attitudes towards close and distant others
(in line with Kant&rsquo;s suggestion). Providing evidence of a causal
relationship, appreciation of natural beauty has been found to lead to
more morally admirable behavior (Zhang et al. 2014; see Silvers &amp;
Haidt 2008 and Landis et al. 2009 for evidence concerning the morally
salubrious effects of appreciating moral beauty). In addition to this
work on beauty, the moral effects of appreciating the sublime have
been explored in the context of empirical work on the nature of awe
(see Piff et al. 2015).</p>

<p>
Philosophers have generally held two main positions about the role
that something&rsquo;s beauty can play in grounding moral standing. On
the one hand, optimists about beauty have argued that beauty confers
intrinsic moral standing&mdash;that is, beautiful things are worthy of
protection independently of their relationship to humans and other
animals (for example, G.E. Moore 1903; Routley, 1973). Pessimists
about beauty, by contrast, think that beauty at best provides a
non-intrinsic kind of moral standing, insofar as it is but one source
of pleasure for humans (for example, Passmore 1974). Experimental
philosophers and empirical aestheticians have recently tried to cast
light on some of the mechanisms that might be involved in
beauty&rsquo;s effects on judgments of moral standing, with a view to
interrogating its normative significance in some cases. Doran (2022),
for example, argues that both the optimists and pessimists are
incorrect. Across two studies with beautiful plants, he shows that to
the extent that people tend to experience the beauty of
plants&mdash;and in particular to the extent that they tend to feel
moved and inspired by the beauty&mdash;they tend to judge that the
plant can feel pain and has intrinsic moral standing. As such, he
argues that the intuitions that optimists appeal to should be
debunked, and that beauty tends to give rise to a state that is more
valuable than mere pleasure, contra the pessimists. Investigating the
issue through the lens of Moral Foundations Theory, Klebl and
colleagues (2022) found that purity intuitions tend to underlie
people&rsquo;s willingness to protect beautiful things.</p>

<h2 id="EmoArt">7. Emotion and Art</h2>

<p>
There is a rich set of puzzles in philosophical aesthetics concerning
 <a href="../fiction-emotion-response/">emotional responses to fictions</a>,
 and here, both psychologists and experimental philosophers have made
contributions, in some cases moving the debate beyond the standard
philosophical concerns. Here we discuss a few of those that have
received the most attention from philosophers: <em>How can fiction
elicit emotional responses when we know that the characters do not
exist? If certain works of art, particularly music, can evoke negative
emotions, like sadness, which we typically aim to avoid in everyday
life, why do we pursue such experiences in art contexts? Moreover, how
can music be expressive of emotions, if there is nobody in the music
itself experiencing them?</em></p>

<p>
The &lsquo;paradox&rsquo; of fiction is motivated by the following
observation: if we were to learn that events in life that make us feel
sad have not in fact come to pass, our sadness would disappear. But
the same is not true in art. I may know that Tolstoy&rsquo;s <em>Anna
Karenina</em> does not exist, and yet may feel sad reading about her
fate in the novel (Radford &amp; Weston 1975). With this in mind, the
paradox of fiction has standardly been formulated as a trilemma of
three individually plausible but mutually inconsistent claims (for
example, Currie 1990):</p>

<ol>

<li>We have emotional responses directed towards fictional entities
and situations in literature and art;</li>

<li>In order to have emotional responses we need to believe in the
existence of the entities and situations that they are directed
at;</li>

<li>We do not believe in the existence of the fictional entities in
literature and art.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Most philosophers have now jettisoned this paradoxical formulation, by
rejecting proposition (2). But, even if there is no paradox per se,
philosophers have noted that interesting questions remain here: <em>Do
our emotional responses to fictions differ from their real-life
cognates? And, if so, what might explain this? Do our emotional
responses to fiction involve different mental representations, for
example? And are any differences that exist sufficient to constitute a
different kind of emotional response?</em></p>

<p>
In connection with this, some experimental philosophers have thought
that the emotional responses that are had in response to fictional
entities and events might differ in their intensity, as a result of
differences in self-referential processes. Sperduti et al. (2016), for
example, asked participants to watch clips of scenarios apt to elicit
positive or negative emotions, or neutral video clips, presented as
either mockumentaries (fiction), or documentaries or amateur films
(non-fiction). Participants self-reported less intense emotions only
in response to the <em>negative</em> clips when they were presented as
fictions, and even here, there were no differences in the
physiological responses (and specifically, in electrodermal activity).
The authors interpret this as suggesting that the emotional responses
to fiction are genuine emotions, on the grounds that there are no
physiological differences, but that appraisals of fictionality might
nonetheless cause people to psychologically distance themselves from
the content (for discussion, see Pelletier 2019). Humbert-Droz et al.
(2020), by contrast, found that longer clips of sad scenes lead to
lower skin conductance when labeled as non-fictional versus fictional,
as well as greater self-reports of sadness&mdash;suggesting that
believing that the clip was real led to greater sadness. Given the
mixed findings in this context, the issues of whether the emotions
that we feel in response to fiction differ from those we feel in
non-fictional contexts, and if so why, remain open questions.</p>

<p>
The paradox of negative emotion (Hume 1757b), has intrigued
philosophers since the time of Aristotle: why do we seek exposure to
art arousing negative emotions if negative emotions is something that
we tend to avoid in our everyday life? One important example is
listening to sad music, which is often thought to evoke sad mood in
listeners (though for dissent, see Kivy 1990). There is vast
psychological literature on emotional responses to music that are
relevant to this philosophical discussion (see Mitterschiffthaler et
al. 2007; Juslin &amp; V&auml;stfj&auml;ll 2008; Vuoskoski &amp;
Eerola 2012; Koelsch, 2014; Peltola &amp; Eerola 2016; Juslin 2019),
and it has received some attention from experimental philosophers as
well.</p>

<p>
Mario Attie-Picker and colleagues (2024) tested the hypothesis that
people choose to listen to sad music because of the emotions music is
expressive of: listening to sad music allows people to feel more
connected. In the first study, participants were presented with
vignettes describing musical pieces with differing levels of musical
proficiency and emotional expressiveness. They were then asked to what
extent they agreed that the described piece of music was good and
embodied the essence of what music is &lsquo;all about&rsquo;. The
results revealed that emotional expressiveness, more so than technical
proficiency, influenced judgments on what are the characteristic
values of music. In the second study, participants were asked to
complete sentences about (a) the characteristic values of music, (b)
feeling connected in conversations, and (c) pleasantness of music.
They found an overlap between the emotions people listed as embodying
what music is &ldquo;all about&rdquo; and the emotions that make
people feel connected in conversations. Attie-Picker and colleagues
thus try to explain the paradox by shifting the focus away from the
traditional emphasis on the listener&rsquo;s felt emotions and instead
centering it on emotions one perceives in music.</p>

<p>
The paradox of emotional expressiveness is related not to the emotions
we feel when we listen to music, but rather emotions we hear in the
music itself. In our everyday conversations, we often characterize
music as joyful, sad or angry. We use those terms when discussing a
piece of music&mdash;an entity that does not have mental states and is
incapable of experiencing emotions.</p>

<p>
One way to empirically study the relationship between music and
emotional expressiveness is through cross-cultural research.
Psychological literature suggests that cross-cultural recognition of
emotions in music is quite limited. Some studies have shown that the
list of cross-culturally recognizable emotions in music is limited to
three basic emotions of happiness, sadness and fear (Fritz et al.
2009). Other studies suggest that even major and minor chords may not,
after all, be universally associated with happiness and sadness
(Lahdelma et al. 2021; Smit et al. 2022). However, at least aversion
to dissonant musical chords appears to be cross-cultural (Lahdelma et
al., 2021).</p>

<p>
The question of cross-cultural recognizably has also been tackled in
Constant Bonard&rsquo;s experimental philosophy paper (2019). Bonard
argues that the affective meaning of a musical piece depends on
musical grammar, as there is an overlap of cognitive mechanisms
constituting the capacity for language and capacity for music.
According to him, listeners familiar with certain musical idioms and
grammatical organizations are better able to perceive the affective
meaning of a piece. Bonard presented his participants in Geneva and
India with excerpts from Western classical music, South Indian music,
as well as a set of atonal melodies that do not belong to either of
these cultures. They were asked to identify musical excerpts that do
not correspond to musical grammatical rules. For both Indian and
Western participants, the Western and atonal (but not Indian) stimuli
were easier to encode for those familiar with the musical idiom.
Participants were also asked to listen to musical extracts and
continually rate how much the music expressed a given emotion. The
study confirmed that participants were better at recognizing the
affective dimension of music that originated from their region. Taken
together, these studies present tentative evidence that the
recognition of emotions in music may depend on familiarity with local
musical grammar rules (for more readings on musical semantics, also
see Schlenker 2017, 2019, 2022).</p>

<p>
The topic of art and emotion induction may also be relevant to
discussions on art and morality. Angelika Seidel and Jesse Prinz
(2013b) found that music can be used to induce positive or negative
emotions, which in turn modifies moral evaluations. Roughly, happy
music increases judgments of goodness, and angry music increases
judgments of wrongness. Seidel and Prinz (2013a) further discovered
that different negative musically-induced emotions, anger and disgust,
can impact the severity of different kinds of moral judgments. A more
complex result comes from Ansani and colleagues (2024), which shows
that musical expertise is likely to lead to more
individualizing&nbsp;moral foundations as opposed to
binding&nbsp;ones.</p>

<h2 id="MetDeb">8. Methodological Debates</h2>

<p>
Throughout this entry, we have generally focused on recent empirical
research done by philosophers on topics in philosophy of art and
aesthetics. However, this scope is admittedly arbitrary. As noted at
the start, the research program that we have surveyed is continuous
with empirical aesthetics in psychology, and comes from a long
historical tradition that encompasses both philosophy and psychology.
The principal reasons to draw boundaries are pragmatic ones.</p>

<p>
Like other branches of experimental philosophy, experimental
philosophy of art and aesthetics involves gathering data using
empirical methods and bringing analyses of the data to bear on
philosophical theorizing. As a matter of general fact, research in
experimental philosophy is relatively replicable (Cova, Strickland, et
al. 2021), and relatively free of scientific misconduct such as
p-hacking (Stuart, Cola&ccedil;o, &amp; Machery 2019). While
experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics is bolstered by this
general track record, it also inherits a number of methodological
challenges from experimental philosophy and related areas of
psychology regarding instruments, samples, and stimuli.</p>

<p>
By far, the most common instrument used in experimental philosophy of
art and aesthetics is&mdash;like other branches of experimental
philosophy and related areas of psychology&mdash;the questionnaire.
Participants&rsquo; responses are measured by their answers to
questions posed by the researchers. Nick Zangwill (2019) expresses a
general skepticism toward studies that use questionnaires, and
criticizes experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics for its wide
use of this specific measurement instrument. Drawing inspiration from
Wittgenstein, Zangwill is pessimistic about the questionnaire&rsquo;s
attempt to use language to reveal agents&rsquo; thoughts generally. In
addition, he is pessimistic about the questionnaire&rsquo;s capacity
to reveal agents&rsquo; normative judgments, such as judgments of
beauty, as opposed to non-normative judgments, such as judgments of
agreeableness. Zangwill&rsquo;s critique could be taken as an
invitation for experimental philosophers to explore methodological
tools beyond the questionnaire. In fact, some philosophers have
already experimented with eye movement tracking (Wright et al. 2019),
virtual reality (Francis et al. 2016), electroencephalography (Bricker
2020), and corpus analysis (Liao, McNally, &amp; Meskin 2016; McNally
&amp; Stojanovic 2017; Sytsma et al. 2019; Chartrand 2022; Doran,
forthcoming a). Some of these or other proposed methods (see Fischer
&amp; Curtis 2019; Fischer &amp; Sytsma 2023) might also enrich
experimental aestheticians&rsquo; toolboxes.</p>

<p>
The most common sample used in experimental philosophy of art and
aesthetics is&mdash;once again, like other branches of experimental
philosophy and related areas of psychology&mdash;WEIRD: participants
from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic countries
(Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan 2010). Whether responses from these
WEIRD participants are representative of people in general remains an
open question. Within experimental philosophy (and related areas in
psychology), there is an ongoing debate about the legitimacy of making
theoretical generalizations based on empirical results from WEIRD
samples (for criticisms, see Stich &amp; Machery 2023 and Peters &amp;
Lemeire 2024; for defenses, see Knobe 2019, 2021). Clearly, this
ongoing debate impacts the evidentiary value of existing research in
experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics as well.</p>

<p>
That said, it is important to highlight a couple of cross-cultural
works in experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics. In one work,
Florian Cova, Christopher Olivola, and colleagues (2019) extend
Cova&rsquo;s earlier research on the intersubjective validity of
aesthetic judgments to a sample that includes participants from 19
countries on four continents. Across six geographical areas (Europe,
Middle East, Central and North America, South America, East Asia, and
South and Southeast Asia), they found both variations and convergences
in patterns of responses. While participants from East Asia tend to
endorse &lsquo;subjectivism&rsquo; about aesthetic judgments (when two
people disagree, both can be correct), participants from other
geographical areas tend to endorse &lsquo;nihilism&rsquo; (when two
people disagree, neither is correct or incorrect). At the same time,
people everywhere tend to not endorse &lsquo;realism&rsquo; (when two
people disagree, at most one can be correct). In another work,
Constant Bonard (2019) conducted studies in Switzerland and India to
vindicate the hypothesis that musical idioms have grammatical
structures. The grammar of Western classical music was found to be
more recognizable to Switzerland participants than Indian
participants, but no reverse asymmetry was found for South Indian
classical music. Another study investigated aesthetic judgments of
mathematical beauty between Chinese and British mathematicians and
found that they do not seem to be strongly influenced by cultural
differences (Sa et al. 2024). As things stand, these three
cross-cultural works remain the exception, and not the norm, in
experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics. The fact that the vast
majority of work has been conducted with Western European and American
samples is not dissimilar to the situation in empirical aesthetics
(see Che, Sun, Gallardo, &amp; Nadal 2018) or music cognition (see
Jacoby et al 2020). As such, this is a problem that needs to be
addressed in all fields that empirically study art and aesthetics.</p>

<p>
In addition, samples used in experimental philosophy of art and
aesthetics tend to be ordinary people with no special expertise in
philosophy or the relevant arts. One criticism of experimental
philosophy&rsquo;s relevance for philosophical theorizing, commonly
called
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-philosophy/#DefePrivIntuRathThanThosOrdiExpePart"><em>the expertise objection</em></a>,
 endorses privileging experts&rsquo; responses over ordinary
people&rsquo;s. While the existing debate primarily concerns the
expertise of philosophers&mdash;insofar as the objectors privilege
philosophers&rsquo; intuitions from thought experiments&mdash;in the
domain of philosophy of art and aesthetics, expertise in the
respective artforms might be relevant as well. Many psychology studies
have shown differences between ordinary people and art experts in
aesthetic judgments and preferences (Hekkert &amp; Van Wieringen,
1996; Leder, Ring, &amp; Dressler 2013), as well as emotional
responses to art (Silvia 2013; Leder, Gerger, et al. 2014), and these
differences are relevant to at least some of the topics experimental
philosophers are interested in. As such, we want to highlight a few
works in this domain that use experts as samples.</p>

<p>
Three studies in experimental philosophy of aesthetics have compared
expert and non-expert samples. In one empirical study based on moral
foundations theory, Alessandro Ansani and colleagues (2024) found that
musical experts tend to have a higher preference for individualizing
moral foundations, Harm and Care. Elz&#279; Mikalonyt&#279; and Vilius
Dranseika (2020) compared intuitions on the individuation of musical
works between musicians and non-musicians and found that although they
tend to be similar, musicians&rsquo; intuitions are usually more
pronounced. However, Mikalonyt&#279; and Dranseika (2022) found no
notable differences between professional singers and orchestra
musicians working in the opera and participants with no music
education. Most of Richard Kamber&rsquo;s (2011) study participants
were art professionals or &lsquo;art buffs&rsquo;, so the study itself
does not allow us to compare experts&rsquo; and non-experts&rsquo;
responses. Kamber explains this methodological decision by stating
that if there is a consensus between professional artists on what
counts as art, philosophers are inclined to agree with professional
artists.</p>

<p>
In other branches of experimental philosophy, many studies rely on
intuitions that arise from thought experiments. This is less so in
experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics. Indeed, Cova and
R&eacute;hault (2019b: 3) speculate that it is because intuitions play
a much less prominent role in philosophical aesthetics that the field
did not draw the initial attention of experimental philosophers. With
that said, it is important to stress that there is variation with
respect to this within this branch of experimental philosophy too.
Emanuele Arielli (2018) distinguishes studies that solicit intuitions
and other cognitive responses and studies that solicit aesthetic
reactions and other perceptual and phenomenological responses. While
critical of the former type of studies, he finds the latter type of
studies more promising insofar as they are more continuous with
empirical aesthetics in psychology.</p>

<p>
Others have remarked on this difference between experimental
philosophy of art and aesthetics and other branches of experimental
philosophy. Clotilde Torregrossa (2020, 2024) argues that insofar as
experimental philosophy of art and aesthetics is more reliant on
reactions to aesthetic phenomena, standard objections against
experimental philosophy that turn on the reliance on intuitions from
thought experiments are less applicable. Jonathan Weinberg (2019)
argues that the availability of artworks means that experimenters need
not rely solely on descriptive vignettes. The presentation of actual
artworks can fill in gaps that are usually left by the short textual
vignettes that are typical of philosophical thought experiments. We
should note, however, that in actuality such studies remain relatively
rare (some examples are Kamber 2011; Meskin et al. 2013; Liao &amp;
Meskin 2017; Bonard 2019; Puy 2022; Mikalonyt&#279; &amp; Canonne
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
There is ongoing debate about whether studies about music should
depend on the use of acoustic stimuli. Building on Weinberg&rsquo;s
argument, Nemesio Puy (2022) contends that ontological judgments about
artworks involve an aesthetic dimension and must therefore be grounded
in the experience of real works of art. This contention receives
indirect support from a study that shows people are generally
unwilling to base their beliefs about aesthetic dimension of an
artwork on testimony alone, without first-personal perceptual access
(Andow 2019). Moreover, this contention receives direct support from
two studies that show that the decision to include or exclude acoustic
stimuli has an effect on the results of studies investigating
ontological judgments, even if the descriptive part of the stimuli is
kept as consistent as possible (Puy 2022; Mikalonyt&#279; &amp;
Canonne forthcoming). Notwithstanding this, Elz&#279; Mikalonyt&#279;
(forthcoming) points out several reasons why purely textual vignettes
are so widely used and might not always be easily replaceable. Such
vignettes might help the participants to focus on the most relevant
aspects and filter out irrelevant factors. In fact, additional
perceptual information may actually distract participants, as may
occur, for example, in making judgments in the ontology of art, which
arguably should be made on the basis of conceptual rather than
perceptual information (such as information about the artist&rsquo;s
intentions). Especially in the case of music, presenting the
participants with short descriptions without corresponding works of
music might help to avoid relying on sustained attention over extended
periods of time.</p>
