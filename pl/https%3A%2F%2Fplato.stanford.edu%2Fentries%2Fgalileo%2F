<p>
Galileo Galilei (1564&ndash;1642) plays a central role in any history
of science and many histories of philosophy. He is a&mdash;if not
<em>the</em>&mdash;central figure of the Scientific Revolution of the
seventeenth century. By middle age, his achievements in physics and
astronomy, his support for the Copernican theory of the solar system,
and his later condemnation by the Roman Church elevated him to heroic
status even during his lifetime. His story has been continuously
retold for more than 400 years. This article summarizes his
contributions, focusing on some of the issues that have garnered

<h2 id="Intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
From the seventeenth century onward, Galileo has been seen by many as
the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of modern science. He is renowned for his
discoveries: he was the first to report telescopic observations of
lunar mountains, the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the
rings of Saturn. He invented an early microscope and a predecessor to
the thermometer. In mathematical physics&mdash;a discipline he helped
create&mdash;he calculated the law of free fall, conceived of an
inertial principle, determined the parabolic trajectory of
projectiles, and recognized the relativity of motion. He is sometimes
described as the first &ldquo;real&rdquo; experimental scientist, who
dropped stones from towers and ships&rsquo; masts, and played with
magnets, clocks, and pendulums. Much of his cultural stature also
arises from his advocacy and popularization of Copernicanism and the
resulting condemnation by the Catholic Inquisition, which has made him
a purported &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; to the cause of rationality and
enlightened modernity in the subsequent history of a supposed
&ldquo;warfare&rdquo; between science and religion. This is no small
set of accomplishments for a court musician&rsquo;s son who left the
University of Pisa without a degree.</p>

<p>
Momentous figures living in momentous times are full of interpretive
fecundity, and Galileo has been the subject of manifold
interpretations and much controversy. This multiplicity is encouraged
by the fact that Galileo was an opportunistic polemicist, who often
presented the most incisive argument available, whether or not it fit
with overarching programmatic aims, if indeed he had any. The use of
Galileo&rsquo;s work and the invocations of his name make a
fascinating history in their own right (Segre 1991; Palmerino and
Thijssen 2004; Finocchiaro 2005; Shea and Artigas 2006; Gattei 2019),
but this is not our topic. Philosophically, Galileo has been used to
exemplify many different themes, usually as a personification of
whatever the writer wished to make the hallmark of the Scientific
Revolution or of good science&mdash;whatever was good about the new
science or science in general, it was Galileo who started it. Indeed,
&ldquo;Galilean Science&rdquo; is often used as a synonym for modern
scientific method.</p>

<p>
One tradition of Galileo scholarship has divided Galileo&rsquo;s work
into three or four parts: (1) his physics, (2) his astronomy, and (3)
his methodology, which might include his method of Biblical
interpretation and/or his thoughts about the nature of proof or
demonstration. In this tradition, typical treatments deal with his
physical and astronomical discoveries, their background, and/or
Galileo&rsquo;s predecessors. More philosophically, many ask how his
mathematical practice relates to his natural philosophy. Was he a
mathematical Platonist (Shea 1972; Jardine 1976; Koyr&eacute; 1978),
an Archimedean mathematician (Machamer 1998a; van Dyck 2006), an
experimentalist (Settle 1967; Settle 1983; Settle 1992; Palmieri 2008;
B&uuml;ttner 2019), an Aristotelian emphasizing experience (Geymonat
1954), an heir of revised Scholastic methods of proof (Wallace 1992;
Miller 2018)? Or did he have no method and just fly like an eagle in
the way that geniuses do (Feyerabend 1975)? Alongside these claims
there have been attempts to place Galileo in an intellectual context
that brings out the background to his achievements. Some have
emphasized his debt to the artisan-engineer practical tradition (Rossi
1962; Valleriani 2010; Peterson 2011), others his mathematics (Giusti
1993; Feldhay 1998; Renn et al. 2000; Palmieri 2001; Palmieri 2003;
Palmerino 2016), his appeal to Scholastic mixed (or subalternate)
mathematics (Machamer 1978; Lennox 1986; Wallace 1992; Dear 1995;
Machamer 1998a), his debt to atomism (Shea 1972; Redondi 1983), his
use of Hellenistic and Medieval impetus theory (Moody 1951; Duhem
1954; Clagett 1959; Shapere 1974), or the idea that discoveries bring
new data into science (Wootton 2015).</p>

<p>
More recent historical research has shifted foci, bringing new
dimensions to our understanding of Galileo by studying his rhetoric
(Finocchiaro 1980; Moss 1993; Feldhay 1998; Spranzi 2004), the power
structures of his social milieu (Biagioli 1993; Biagioli 2006), his
personal quest for acknowledgment (Shea and Artigas 2003), and more
generally emphasizing the larger social and cultural history (Reeves
2008; Bucciantini, et al. 2015), in particular the court and papal
culture in which Galileo functioned (Redondi 1983; Heilbron 2010).</p>

<p>
Still, almost everyone working in this field seems to think the three
areas&mdash;physics, astronomy, and methodology&mdash;are distinct and
represent different Galilean endeavors. This entry will address
Galileo&rsquo;s work through three prisms that cut across, to some
extent, this traditional distinction. First, we will address his
investigations in physics and astronomy, showing how these form a
coherent and unified project extending from his earliest work all the
way to the <em>Two New Sciences</em>, which stands as the completion
of his overall endeavor and not just the reworking of earlier research
he reverted to after his trial. Particularly, we shall try to show why
both of the two new sciences, especially the first on material
strength, were so important&mdash;a topic not often treated (Biener
2004; Raphael 2011). Second, we will highlight some of the aspects of
Galileo&rsquo;s work that, though sometimes incidental to his own
interests, have captured the attention of philosophical scholars.
These include his methodology and mathematics, especially his attempts
to fashion a new discipline of mathematical physics, but also his use
of empirical evidence and thought experiments. Finally, we shall add
some discussion about the interactions between Galileo and the
Catholic Church relating to their views on epistemic authority.</p>

<h2 id="BriefBio">2. Brief Biography</h2>

<p>
Galileo was born in Pisa on February 15, 1564. By the time he died on
January 8, 1642 (but for problems with the date, see Machamer 1998b,
24&ndash;25), he was as famous as any person in Europe.</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s father Vincenzo, though of noble heritage, was a
semi-itinerant court musician and composer of modest means, who also
authored treatises on music theory; his mother, Giulia Ammannati,
descended from Pisan cloth merchants. In 1572, they resettled the
family in Florence. As a boy, Galileo was tutored privately and, for a
time, by the Camaldolese monks at Vallombrosa, where he considered a
religious vocation and may have started a novitiate. He was called
home, however, and then enrolled for a medical degree at the
University of Pisa in 1580. He never completed this degree, but
instead studied mathematics, notably with Ostilio Ricci, a teacher
attached to the Tuscan court and the Florentine Accademia del
Disegno.</p>

<p>
After leaving university, Galileo worked as a private mathematics
tutor around Florence and Siena and cultivated the support of leading
mathematicians. He visited Christoph Clavius, professor at the Jesuit
Collegio Romano, and corresponded with the engineer Guildobaldo del
Monte, Marchese of Urbino. In 1588, he applied unsuccessfully for a
professorship in Bologna, but a year later, with the help of Clavius
and del Monte, he was appointed lecturer in mathematics at Pisa. In
1592, he obtained, at a much higher salary, a chair of mathematics at
the University of Padua, in the Venetian Republic. Galileo also
supplemented his income by producing a calculating instrument of his
own design (see Galilei 1606) and other devices in a household
workshop staffed by hired artisans, and by private tutoring and
consulting on practical mathematics and engineering. During this
period, he began a relationship with Marina Gamba. A daughter,
Virginia, was born in 1600. Another, Livia, was born in 1601, and a
son, Vincenzo, in 1606.</p>

<p>
In Padua, Galileo worked out much of the mechanics he would publish
later in life, and which constitute his primary lasting contribution
to physical science. However, these projects were interrupted in 1609,
when Galileo heard about the recently invented spyglass, invented an
improved telescope, and used it to make astounding celestial
discoveries. He announced some of these in <em>Sidereus nuncius</em>
(<em>Starry Messenger</em>), which appeared in March 1610 and launched
Galileo onto the world stage. Among many others, Johannes Kepler,
Imperial Mathematician at Prague, lauded the work (Kepler 1610).
Clavius and his colleagues at the Collegio Romano confirmed its
results and threw a celebratory banquet when Galileo visited in 1611.
During the same Roman sojourn, Galileo was admitted to what was
perhaps the first scientific society, the Accademia dei Lincei; he
would style himself &ldquo;Lincean Academician&rdquo; for the rest of
his life. For fascinating treatments of this period of Galileo&rsquo;s
life and motivations, see (Biagioli 2006; Reeves 2008; Wilding
2014).</p>

<p>
Galileo also used the <em>Starry Messenger</em> to solicit patronage
in his native Tuscany, naming the moons of Jupiter he had found the
&ldquo;Medicean&rdquo; stars in honor of the ruling Medici family. His
negotiations were ultimately successful, and Galileo moved back to
Florence as &ldquo;Chief Mathematician and Philosopher to the Grand
Duke&rdquo; and holder of a sinecure professorship at Pisa. His
daughters moved with him and were placed in the convent of Saint
Matthew at Arcetri, near Florence. Vincenzo and his mother were left
behind in Venice.</p>

<p>
Now a courtier, Galileo entered into several public debates on
scientific topics. In 1612, he published a <em>Discourse on Floating
Bodies</em>, and in 1613, <em>Letters on Sunspots</em>, where he first
openly expressed support for Copernican heliocentrism. In
1613&ndash;14, Galileo participated in discussions of Copernicanism
through his student Benedetto Castelli, and wrote a <em>Letter to
Castelli</em> defending the doctrine from theological objections.
Meanwhile, it had become known that Copernicanism was under scrutiny
by Church authorities. Galileo lectured and lobbied against its
condemnation, expanding his <em>Letter to Castelli</em> into the
widely circulated <em>Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina</em> in
1615 and travelling to Rome late that year. Nevertheless, in March
1616, Copernicus&rsquo;s <em>On the Revolutions of the Heavenly
Orbs</em> was suspended (i.e., temporarily censored) pending
correction by the Congregation of the Index of Prohibited Books.
Galileo himself was called to an audience with Cardinal Robert
Bellarmine, a leading theologian and member of the Roman Inquisition,
and admonished not to teach or defend Copernican theory. (The details
of this episode are far from straightforward, and remain disputed even
today. See Shea and Artigas 2003; Fantoli 2005.)</p>

<p>
In 1623, Galileo published <em>The Assayer</em>, which deals with the
nature of comets and argues they are sublunary phenomena. This book
includes some of Galileo&rsquo;s most famous methodological
pronouncements, including the claim that the book of nature is written
in the language of mathematics. It also contains passages suggestive
of atomism, a heretical doctrine, and the book was anonymously
referred to the Inquisition, which dismissed the complaint.</p>

<p>
Also in 1623, Maffeo Barberini, Galileo&rsquo;s supporter and friend,
was elected Pope Urban VIII. Galileo felt empowered to begin work on
his <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em>. The
&ldquo;two systems&rdquo; are the Ptolemaic and Copernican, and the
text clearly, though not explicitly, favors the latter. Printing was
completed in Florence by February 1632. Shortly afterwards, the
Inquisition banned its sale, and Galileo was ordered to Rome for
trial. In June 1633, Galileo was convicted of &ldquo;vehement
suspicion of heresy,&rdquo; and a sentence of imprisonment was
immediately commuted to perpetual house arrest. (There is more about
these events and their implications in the final section of this
entry,
 <a href="#GaliChur">Galileo and the Church</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
In 1634, while Galileo was confined to his villa in Arcetri, his
beloved eldest daughter died (Sobel 1999). Around this time, he began
work on his final book, <em>Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations
Concerning Two New Sciences</em>, based on the mechanics he had
developed early in his career. Though it says nothing at all about
cosmology, the manuscript had to be smuggled out of Italy and was
published in Holland by the Elzeviers in 1638. Galileo died early in
1642, and due to his condemnation, his burial place was obscure until
he was re-interred in 1737.</p>

<p>
For detailed biographical material, the best and classic work dealing
with Galileo&rsquo;s scientific achievements is Stillman Drake&rsquo;s
<em>Galileo at Work</em> (1978). More recently, J. L. Heilbron has
written a magnificent biography, <em>Galileo</em> (2010), that touches
on all the multiple facets of his life.</p>

<h2 id="SciAchieve">3. Galileo&rsquo;s Scientific Achievement</h2>

<h3 id="EarlyWork">3.1 Early Work in Mechanics</h3>

<p>
In the study of the motions of bodies, what Galileo accomplished by
the end of his life was a reasonably articulated replacement for the
traditional set of analytical concepts derived from the Aristotelian
tradition of natural philosophy. He offered, in place of the
Aristotelian categories, a set of mechanical archetypes that were
accepted by most everyone who afterwards developed the &ldquo;new sciences,&rdquo;
and which, in some form or another, became the hallmark of the new
philosophy of nature. Galileo&rsquo;s central problem&mdash;the proper
characterization of these archetypes in appropriate physical
terms&mdash;was the launching point for the new physics of the early
modern period.</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s main move was to dethrone the traditional Aristotelian
physical categories used to describe matter and motion. These were the
celestial element (aether, or quintessence&mdash;i.e., &ldquo;fifth
element&rdquo;) and the four terrestrial ones (fire, air, water, and earth),
along with their respective motive natures (rotation in the heavens;
heaviness and lightness in the terrestrial realm). In their place, he
asserted a single corporeal matter, whose properties and motions he
described using the mathematics of proportional relations typified by
the Archimedean simple machines&mdash;the balance, the inclined plane,
and the lever&mdash;to which Galileo added the pendulum (Machamer
1998a; Machamer and Hepburn 2004; Palmieri 2008; B&uuml;ttner 2019).
In doing so, Galileo changed the acceptable vocabulary for talking
about matter and motion, and so ushered in the mechanical tradition
that characterizes much of modern science. (See Dijksterhuis 1961;
Machamer, et al. 2000; Gaukroger 2006; Roux and Garber 2013.) This
achievement is sometimes described in psychological terms, as an
introduction of new mental models (Palmieri 2003) or a new model of
intelligibility (Machamer 1994; Machamer, 1998a; Adams, et al. 2017).
But it is perhaps more useful to see him as being fundamentally
motivated to find a unified, quantitative theory of matter&mdash;a
mathematical theory of the material stuff that constitutes the whole
of the cosmos. Perhaps he did not realize that this was his grand
project until he wrote the <em>Two New Sciences</em> in the mid-1630s,
but it is evident even in his early studies from the 1590s, when his
programmatic intentions were more limited.</p>

<p>
At the outset of his career, Galileo sought merely to apply the
rigorous mathematical approach he found in Archimedes to individual
problems involving the spontaneous motions of bodies, especially the
motion of bodies in fluid media and on inclined planes. In particular,
Galileo aimed to assimilate these phenomena to the behavior of
Archimedean simple machines, especially the balance, and thence to the
mathematical law of the lever, affording quantitative accounts of the
physical effects. At first, he showed no animosity toward Aristotelian
natural philosophy, and adopted by default its physical doctrines.
However, as work progressed, Galileo continually found himself at odds
with fundamental Aristotelian assumptions.</p>

<p>
Galileo began his critique of Aristotle in manuscript treatises he
drafted around 1590, the later version of which has been given the
title <em>De motu</em> (<em>On Motion</em>). The first part of this
text deals with terrestrial matter and argues that Aristotle&rsquo;s
theory has it wrong. For Aristotle, the matter of the terrestrial
realm possesses two formal principles that give rise to its natural
motions: heaviness (<em>gravitas</em>; in earth and water) and
lightness (<em>levitas</em>; in air and fire). Galileo argues that
there is only one principle of motion&mdash;heaviness. Bodies move
upward not because they have a natural lightness, he says, but because
they are displaced or extruded by heavier bodies or media moving
downward, just as in fluid media and on the balance. So on
Galileo&rsquo;s view, there is no lightness. Heaviness is the sole
cause of all natural terrestrial motion.</p>

<p>
This move left Galileo with a problem: what is this heaviness and how
is it to be mathematically described? In reply, he reached for
Archimedean models. In the context of floating bodies, heaviness is
the weight of one body minus the weight of the medium. On an
equal-armed balance, a body&rsquo;s effective heaviness is the
proportionality of the weight of an object on one arm of the balance
to the weight of another body on the other arm. These models led to
consideration of specific gravity&mdash;i.e., a body&rsquo;s weight
per unit volume&mdash;and, in the manuscript <em>Le Meccaniche</em>
(<em>On Mechanics</em>, ca. 1600), the introduction of the concept of
<em>momento</em>. Though somewhat amorphous even in Galileo&rsquo;s
usage, <em>momento</em> can be thought of as effective weight in a
mechanical system; e.g., a body further from a fulcrum has greater
<em>momento</em> than a body closer to it (Galluzzi 1979).</p>

<p>
Galileo accepted, probably as early as the 1594 draft of <em>Le
Meccaniche</em>, that natural motions are accelerated. Particularly in
the cases of the pendulum, the inclined plane, free fall, and
projectile motion, Galileo must have observed that the speeds of
bodies increase as they move downwards. He also saw that the
percussive blow delivered by a falling body depended on the height of
its fall. Galileo sought to connect these phenomena to the
accumulation of weight/<em>momento</em>, but could not devise an
adequate account. Here, Galileo was stymied by the Aristotelian
conception of motion as change of place (something that happens
<em>through</em> time, not <em>at</em> a time). For many years, he
thought that the correct science of these phenomena would describe how
a body&rsquo;s <em>momento</em> changes according to <em>where</em> it
is in its trajectory. Another problem was the Archimedean simple
machines he used as his conceptual models. These are not easily
conceived of dynamically (but see Machamer and Woody 1994), since they
generally work by establishing static equilibrium. In discussing a
balance, for instance, one does not normally think about how fast an
arm descends or rises (though Galileo does in his <em>Postils to
Rocco</em> circa 1634&ndash;45; see Palmieri 2005). The converse is
also true. It is difficult to model dynamic phenomena that involve
rates of change as balance arms moving upwards or downwards because of
differential <em>momenti</em>.</p>

<p>
Sometime around 1601, however, Galileo recognized the isochrony of the
pendulum&mdash;i.e., the period depends only on the length of the
cord, regardless of the length of the cord. This led to the
realization that time is a crucial parameter, and that a body&rsquo;s
<em>momento</em> could be characterized by <em>when</em> it is in its
trajectory. Experiments with inclined planes then led to the discovery
of the law of free fall&mdash;i.e., a body in free fall from rest
traverses a distance proportional to the square of the time elapsed.
At first still beholden to the Aristotelian conception of motion,
Galileo attempted to express this law as a speed-distance relation,
and the equivalent mean proportion. His later and correct definition
of natural acceleration relating motion directly to time, without
recourse to weight, was an insight gained from the recognition of the
physical significance of that mean proportion as a measure of time
(Machamer and Hepburn 2004; for a different analysis of
Galileo&rsquo;s discovery of the law of fall, see Renn et al.
2000).</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s mature law of fall also implies motion is a quantity
inhering in a body <em>at</em> each moment&mdash;an instantaneous
velocity&mdash;not as an Aristotelian displacement <em>through</em>
time. This idea that motion is a quantity inhering in a body
intersects with the medieval <em>impetus</em> tradition. But more
significantly, it makes motion part of the characteristic state of a
body, and this led to the novel and crucially important inertial
concept. Aristotle had categorized all motions as either
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;&mdash;caused by a body&rsquo;s intrinsic motive
nature&mdash;or &ldquo;violent&rdquo;&mdash;caused by extrinsic
action. In the course of his early considerations of inclined planes,
Galileo noted that a body in equilibrium has neither natural tendency
toward nor resistance to motion. Thus, for instance, the motion of a
body on a frictionless horizontal surface is neither natural nor
forced (i.e., violent), but &ldquo;neutral.&rdquo; Developing this
idea, Galileo could now propose that, in the absence of extrinsic
action, motion is conserved by a body from moment to moment. Galileo
eventually made this conservation principle explicit in <em>Sunspot
Letters</em> (1613):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And therefore, with all the external impediments removed, a heavy body
on the spherical surface concentric to the Earth will be indifferent
to rest and to movement toward any part of the horizon, and it will
remain in the state in which it has been put; that is, if it has been
put in a state of rest it will remain in it, and if it has been put in
motion, toward the west, for example, it will remain in the same
state. (Galilei and Scheiner 2010, 125)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This became the kernel of the <em>inertia</em> principle fundamental
to modern physics.</p>

<p>
Notably, Galileo did not consistently associate the state of motion
conserved by a body with any particular trajectory. In principle,
conserved motion might be rectilinear or curvilinear, translational or
rotational. At some points in his corpus, Galileo ascribes a state of
rectilinear motion to moving bodies; for instance, the rectilinear
tangential tendency of a stone whirled in a sling in the
<em>Dialogue</em>. However, Galileo generally held that equilibrium is
only maintained by circular rotations around an axis. E.g., strictly
speaking, a horizontal surface is spherical, so the body&rsquo;s
conserved motion along it would be circular. This is why
Galileo&rsquo;s principle is sometimes described as <em>circular</em>
inertia (Hooper 1998; Miller 2011; van Dyck 2018).</p>

<p>
By 1609, Galileo had developed novel and successful accounts of the
inclined planes, buoyancy, pendulums, and free fall. In so doing, he
had ushered in a conception of terrestrial matter as uniformly heavy,
inertial, and whose dynamical state is characterized by specific
gravity and instantaneous velocity. He was also conducting experiments
to determine the trajectory of projectiles, which combines inertial
horizontal motion with vertical fall, and trying to incorporate
percussive force into his analyses. Yet publication of most of these
advances would have to wait until the <em>Two New Science</em> in
1638. Even as that book went to press, Galileo was still laboring on a
&ldquo;Fifth Day&rdquo; (not published until 1718) about percussion.
Why the long hiatus? Because during a sojourn in Venice in July 1609,
Galileo heard about a recent Dutch invention, the spyglass.</p>

<h3 id="Astronomy">3.2 Astronomy</h3>

<p>
Galileo was already acquainted with optical lenses from his household
workshop, and he was able to correctly guess the basic principle of
the spyglass even without handling an example. Even more remarkably,
while the Dutch instruments could magnify two- or threefold, Galileo
soon produced a version capable of magnifying by twenty times. By the
late autumn, he was using it to record celestial observations. Galileo
regarded details of the Moon&rsquo;s illumination by the Sun
suggesting that its surface was mountainous. He saw that nebulae are
not clouds but collections of discrete stars. And, most momentously,
he discovered that Jupiter is accompanied by four satellites, today
called the Galilean moons. To establish his priority, and curry favor
with his Florentine patrons-to-be, he rushed these novelties into
print as the <em>Starry Messenger</em> in March 1610.</p>

<p>
The short pamphlet&rsquo;s appearance was a watershed in numerous
respects. Scholastic cosmology held that, whereas the terrestrial
elemental world with its diversity of natures exhibited multitudinous
change, the aethereal heavens at most placidly and eternally rotated
in their places. But Galileo&rsquo;s telescope revealed a very
Earth-like Moon, with mountains and valleys, and showed that Jupiter
has moons just like the Earth&rsquo;s. In both cases, the observations
drew similarities between celestial objects and the Earth. Later in
1610, Galileo also observed that Venus exhibits phases, indicating
that it orbits the Sun, and that Saturn&rsquo;s appearance also
changed (he was seeing Saturn&rsquo;s rings, although he did not fully
understand this). By dissolving the strict Aristotelian dichotomy
between terrestrial and celestial realms, these observations all made
a planetary earth more plausible, thereby supporting the Copernican
hypothesis. They likewise suggested that the heavens are made of the
same stuff as the Earth, and thus subject to the same, unified
physics. This implied the physical characterization of terrestrial
matter Galileo had been slowly developing might be extended
universally.</p>

<p>
<em>Starry Messenger</em> transformed Galileo into a courtier and
intellectual celebrity, famed across Europe, and drew him into
numerous disputes regarding the causes of buoyancy (<em>Discourse on
Floating Bodies</em>, 1612), sunspots (<em>Sunspot Letters</em>,
1613), comets (<em>The Assayer</em>, 1623), and&mdash;most
famously&mdash;Copernicanism. Galileo had privately declared his
belief in heliocentrism as early as 1597 in a letter to Kepler, but he
did not publicize his view until the <em>Sunspot Letters</em>,
whereupon he became Copernicanism&rsquo;s best known advocate. He was
thus an important party to the Catholic Church&rsquo;s scrutiny of the
doctrine addressed in more detail below. In the meantime, we can
sketch Galileo&rsquo;s arguments for Copernicanism, culminating in his
<em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em> (1632).</p>

<p>
In the <em>Sunspot Letters</em> Galileo established that sunspots are
surface features of the sun, and thus another locus of celestial
mutability. Tracking the spots&rsquo; motions also showed that the sun
is rotating on an axis, like the Earth in the Copernican view.
Ironically, in <em>The Assayer</em> Galileo rejects the best
pre-telescopic evidence in favor of Copernicanism&mdash;the comets,
which Tycho Brahe had shown to move through the supposedly solid
celestial spheres in trajectories around the Sun. But Galileo
ridicules the notion that comets are celestial objects, instead
insisting that they are sublunary phenomena produced by optical
refraction in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>
By the late 1620s, Galileo had resolved to produce a text defending
Copernicanism, as far as was permitted by the Church&rsquo;s 1616
condemnation of the doctrine. This became the <em>Dialogue</em>,
published after extended negotiations with the censors. In the book,
Galileo is not concerned with the cosmographic arrangement and
parameters of the planetary orbits, as Copernicus himself had been.
Rather, his focus is on the <em>physical</em> possibility of the
Earth&rsquo;s motion. While never openly avowing the geokinetic view,
the book marshals many arguments in its favor. (For a detailed
overview of the <em>Dialogue</em>, see Finocchiaro 2014.)</p>

<p>
In the first two Days of the <em>Dialogue</em>, Galileo argues
negatively, aiming to show that available evidence, especially its
apparent stability, does not decide between a moving or stationary
Earth. That is, &ldquo;&hellip; all experiments [<em>tutte
l&rsquo;esperienze</em>] practicable upon the earth are insufficient
measures for proving its mobility, since they are indifferently
adaptable to an earth in motion or at rest&rdquo; (Galilei 1967, 6).
Here, Galileo&rsquo;s earlier physics comes to the fore, and his
arguments already depend on the thesis that all matter moves according
to the same physical principles. On the basis of his inertial
principle, he holds that all terrestrial bodies conserve the
Earth&rsquo;s rotation, even when disconnected from its surface. Since
we cannot observe shared motion&mdash;the principle of Galilean
Relativity&mdash;experiments will not disclose it. For instance, a
cannonball dropped from the top of a tower will fall at its foot
whether the earth is moving or not, since the ball continues moving
eastward along with the tower even after it is released.</p>

<p>
Having thus deflected arguments against the Copernican system, Galileo
then argues positively in its favor. In Day Three of the
<em>Dialogue</em>, Galileo&rsquo;s avatar Salviati has Simplicio, the
ever-astounded Aristotelian, make use of astronomical observations,
especially the facts that Venus has phases and that Venus and Mercury
are never far from the sun, to construct a diagram of the planetary
orbits. The resulting diagram neatly corresponds to the Copernican
solar system. Then in Day Four, Galileo offers a putative proof of
Copernican theory on the basis of the tides. He argues that the
combination of the Earth&rsquo;s diurnal rotation and its annual
revolution around the sun can account for the flux and reflux of the
seas. At a spot on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, the directions of the
two motions are aligned in the daytime and contrary at night. Thus, in
the frame of the fixed stars, the surface slightly accelerates and
decelerates over the course of a day, causing the seas to slosh back
and forth in their basins. Monthly and annual variations of the tidal
cycle can likewise be attributed to features of the Earth&rsquo;s
orbit that affect the alignment of the two motions. As Galileo
acknowledges, however, this &ldquo;primary&rdquo; variation can only
account for one tidal cycle per day, whereas two are actually
observed. To account for this &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; effect, Galileo
suggests that the impetus acquired by an ebbing sea will carry it past
equilibrium until it rises against the opposite shore, like the bob of
a pendulum, giving rise to the second tide. More local differences in
tidal flows, meanwhile, are due to the physical conformations of the
basins in which they occur (for background and more detail, see
Palmieri 1998).</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s tidal argument has always been skeptically received,
even by his contemporaries (Aiton 1954; Naylor 2007; Palmieri 1998).
The main trouble is that it poorly aligns with observations. For one
thing, the timing of tides moves around the clock from day to day;
they are not anchored to noon and midnight as Galileo&rsquo;s theory
implies. Galileo also ignores completely the apparent correlation
between the tides and the location of the moon. This had already led
Kepler and others to hypothesize they were due to the moon&rsquo;s
influence, an idea Galileo dismisses out of hand as occult nonsense.
And even if one were to grant Galileo&rsquo;s argument, it would only
establish the Earth&rsquo;s motion, not the central position of the
Sun or arrangement of the planets around it as proposed by Copernicus.
So, at best, Galileo&rsquo;s argument is an inference to the best
partial explanation from a limited set of features of
Copernicus&rsquo;s theory. Meanwhile, there were compelling
considerations about the size of celestial bodies that weighed against
the Copernican cosmology, stemming from a lack of understanding of the
telescope&rsquo;s optics (Graney 2015). Ultimately, Galileo&rsquo;s
reliance on the tides to make his case for Copernicanism is a mistake
to modern eyes, but it is still further evidence of Galileo&rsquo;s
consolidating conception of a universal matter, subject only to
mechanical causes acting by contact.</p>

<h3 id="LaterWork">3.3 Later Work in Mechanics</h3>

<p>
The publication of the <em>Dialogue</em> triggered the climax of
Galileo&rsquo;s confrontation with the Church and his condemnation to
house arrest. Henceforth, Galileo could not safely comment on
astronomical matters, and he returned to his earlier work on
mechanics, leading to the <em>Two New Sciences</em> in 1638.</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s second new science, in Days Three and Four of the
<em>Two New Sciences</em>, has been much commented upon in the
literature. This is where Galileo finally publishes his mathematical
description of local motion and the laws governing it, thereby
completing the departure from Aristotelian categories he had developed
over the previous decades. This is now the motion of <em>all</em>
matter, not just sublunary stuff, and the treatment takes the
categories of time and acceleration and the principle of inertia as
basic. The First Day contains Galileo&rsquo;s account of the
acceleration of falling bodies, leading to the enunciation of his law
of free fall (Palmerino 2010). And, in the Second Day, he combines
vertical motion subject to the law with inertial horizontal motion to
demonstrate the parabolic trajectory of projectiles, thereby solving
an important outstanding problem in practical mathematics.
Incidentally, this would open the way towards analyzing motions as
vector quantities (Miller 2017).</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s first new science, discussed in the first two Days,
has been misunderstood and infrequently discussed. It has misleadingly
been called the science of the strength of materials, and so seems to
have been placed in the history of engineering. However, this science
is not about the strength of materials <em>per se</em>. It is
Galileo&rsquo;s attempt to provide a mathematical science of his
unified matter (see Machamer 1998a; Biener 2004; Machamer and Hepburn
2004). Galileo realizes that, before he can work out a science of the
motion of matter, he must have some way of showing that the nature of
matter still may be mathematically characterized. That is, he needs to
reconcile mathematical descriptions with the physical constitution of
material bodies.</p>

<p>
So it is in Day One that Galileo begins to discuss how to describe
mathematically (or geometrically) the causes of the breaking of beams
as a way of characterizing the internal, microphysical properties of
macroscopic objects. In this vein, Galileo rejects using finite atoms
as a basis for physical discussion, since they are not representable
by continuously divisible mathematical magnitudes. Instead, he treats
matter as composed of infinitely many indivisible&mdash;which is to
say, mathematical&mdash;points. This allows him to give mathematical
accounts for various properties of matter. Among these are the density
of matter, its coherence in material bodies, and the properties of the
resisting media in which bodies move. The Second Day lays out the
mathematical principles concerning how bodies break. Galileo does all
this by reducing the problems of matter to problems of how a lever and
a balance function, which renders them mathematically tractable via
the law of the lever. He had begun this back in 1590, though this time
he believes he is getting it right, showing mathematically how bits of
matter solidify and stick together, and how they break into bits.</p>

<p>
The sketch above provides the basis for understanding Galileo&rsquo;s
career. He offered a new science of matter, a new physical
cosmography, and a new science of local motion. In all these, he used
a mathematical mode of description based upon, though somewhat changed
from, the proportional geometry of Book VI of Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em> and of Archimedes (for details on the changes, see
Palmieri 2001). In this way, Galileo developed the categories of the
mechanical new science, the science of matter and motion. Throughout,
he was working out the details of the nature of matter so that it
could be understood as uniform and universal, and treated in a way
that allowed for coherent discussion of the principles of motion. It
was due to Galileo that a unified matter became accepted and its
nature became one of the problems for the science and philosophy that
followed, especially in the so-called Mechanical Philosophy that
dominated the next century. After him, matter really mattered.</p>

<h2 id="PhilInflu">4. Galileo&rsquo;s Philosophical Influence</h2>

<h3 id="MathPhys">4.1 Mathematical Physics</h3>

<p>
As the title of his last book suggests, even Galileo took himself to
be doing something novel. Wherein lies the novelty, though, is hard to
pin down, especially given Galileo&rsquo;s prioritization of
rhetorical effect over ideological principle. As noted above, this has
made for interpretive fecundity, but it also entails that
Galileo&rsquo;s appraisal has mainly been in the eye of the beholder.
Nevertheless, Galileo was instrumental in the creation of a new field
of inquiry&mdash;that of mathematical physics, wherein mathematical
calculations are taken to be informative about the causal structure of
the natural world.</p>

<p>
At the start of his working career, Galileo inhabited the social role
of <em>mathematicus</em>, someone skilled at computation hired to
execute calculations necessary for other, mostly artisanal,
professions (Biagioli 1989; Garber 2010; van Dyck 2021), including
astrology and engineering. Historically, the <em>mathematicus</em> had
been starkly distinct, both socially and disciplinarily, from the
university professors of philosophy who explained the causal
principles by which the natural world operates. In the sixteenth
century, university chairs, like those Galileo held at Pisa and Padua,
were created to answer the need for mathematical instruction among the
upper classes, especially future military officers after the advent of
gunpowder artillery. When Galileo was young, this social elevation of
<em>mathematici</em> occasioned a debate&mdash;the so-called
<em>Quaestio de certitudine mathematicarum</em>&mdash;about the status
of mathematics vis &agrave; vis natural science. In particular, its
participants debated whether mathematics could generate understanding
of the natural world. Aristotelians and Platonists alike enforced the
old distinction, the former because they held mathematical categories
to be merely accidental to physically causal essences; the latter
because the natural world cannot instantiate mathematical perfection.
But the debate eventually eroded the disciplinary boundary between
mathematics and philosophy. Some participants held that the rational
necessity of mathematics entails causal necessity in nature, such that
the physical world itself obeys mathematical laws and, conversely,
mathematics is explanatory, thereby legitimating the application of
mathematics to natural philosophy. Recent scholars have pointed to the
novel syncretic positions arising in the <em>Quaestio de
certitudine</em> as an important context of Galileo&rsquo;s thought
(Giacobbe 1981; Mancosu 1996; Feldhay 1998; Miller 2021).</p>

<p>
Galileo exploited the weakness in the social and disciplinary bounds.
The persona Galileo launched into public discourse with <em>Starry
Messenger</em> was a novel hybrid that blended traditional roles and
disciplines. As his title pages henceforth proclaimed, he was
simultaneously mathematician and philosopher&mdash;as both
<em>mathematicus</em> and professor&mdash;licensed to draw conclusions
about fundamental natures from mathematical demonstrations. He takes
it as a matter of course that mathematics is informative about the
natural world. This is the upshot of his famous pronouncement in
<em>The Assayer</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Philosophy is written in this grand book&mdash;I mean the
Universe&mdash;which stands continually open to our gaze, but it
cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the
language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is
written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are
triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is
humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these,
one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo et al. 1960,
184)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, nature is essentially subject to mathematical
characterization and can only be fully understood with the aid
mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>
While a narrative account of Galileo&rsquo;s evolving thought is
offered above, it is nevertheless true that he never offered much in
the way of programmatic consideration or justification of his
methodology. This has engendered disagreement among scholars trying to
discern his methodological commitments and various interpretations of
the passage above. Much of the debate has been colored by
Koyr&eacute;&rsquo;s (1978) placement of Galileo among the Platonists,
against which scholars have argued in subsequent decades. (Palmerino
2016 gives an overview; see also the sources cited in the Introduction
of this entry.) Whatever his motivations, Galileo&rsquo;s amalgamation
of physics and mathematics has been seen to stand athwart tradition by
critics and supporters alike, both in his time and now.</p>

<h3 id="EmpRat">4.2 Empiricism and Rationalism</h3>

<p>
Empiricism is another central feature of modern science often
attributed to Galilean roots. But one must be careful not to
exaggerate this empirical turn or Galileo&rsquo;s role in it. For one
thing, it is not correct to say pre-Galilean natural philosophy was
not empirical. Even in Aristotelian science, observations help
establish knowledge of the natural world, via natural history for
instance. For another thing, Galileo certainly was not the only one
contributing to the shift. At the very least, one must also look to
Johannes Kepler and Francis Bacon, who were working at the same time.
Still, Galileo&rsquo;s lifetime was a period in which the epistemic
value of observation markedly increased, such that methods of inquiry
that came afterward are recognizably different from what came
before.</p>

<p>
The key epistemological issue in this context was the relationship
between the universal propositions of natural philosophical theorizing
and the particular instances of empirical research. On the traditional
view, natural philosophy concerned what was true in general,
&ldquo;always or for the most part&rdquo; as Aristotle put it
(<em>Physics</em> II.8), and one could not learn anything from
particulars (<em>Posterior Analytics</em> I.31). Consequently, natural
philosophy started with what was known generally to be the case, often
as abstracted and handed down in some authoritative text, whereas
particular observations, even in aggregate, could neither support nor
refute theoretical generalizations. Speculating about nature <em>ex
cathedra</em> was not only possible, but in some respects the
preferred method.</p>

<p>
Galileo, by contrast, was contemptuous of the natural philosopher who
learns only from books. Referring to his opponent in the
<em>Assayer</em>, he wrote, &ldquo;&hellip; Sarsi says he does not
want to be one to give affront to wise men by contradicting what they
say and refusing to believe them, I say that I do not want to be among
those ignoramuses and ingrates toward nature and toward God who, being
given senses and reason, should wish to defer such great gifts to the
mistakes of one man&rdquo; (Galilei et al. 1960, 301&ndash;2). Galileo
clearly enjoyed going from the armchair to the workbench. He devised
and constructed apparatuses to try out ideas, such as armored
lodestones, inclined planes, and pendulums. His construction of a
telescope on the basis of a mere verbal report is another example.
Importantly, Galileo was remarkably careful to validate his
instruments and diligently record detailed measurements, quantifying
where he could (Brown 1985; Hamou 2021). His descriptions of the moon
and Jovian satellites in <em>Starry Messenger</em> and of the sunspots
in the <em>Letters</em> were early paragons of observational practice.
They, and especially their accompanying engravings, also had an
important popularizing effect, insofar as readers sought to make their
own observations. Indeed, several of Galileo&rsquo;s acolytes were
inspired to found the short-lived Accademia del Cimento in 1657 for
the purpose of carrying out experiments. (See Reeves 2008; Miller
2013.)</p>

<p>
While experimentation certainly helped Galileo arrive at his
theoretical views, observational evidence plays a more circumscribed
role in his published justifications of them. Again, Galileo is more
interested in rhetorical effect than methodological consistency, so it
is difficult to generalize about his method, even if his publications
are filled with described experiences, real and imagined. That said,
Galileo&rsquo;s use of such empirical evidence is predominantly
<em>post hoc</em>. He presents particular observations to confirm or
reject theoretical proposals derived from rational considerations, not
as inductive support for a theory. (Day 3 of the <em>Dialogue</em> is
a notable exception.) As one can see in the narrative of his
scientific work above, his aim was to develop the proper
(quantitative) categories and principles by which one could construct
rational, ideally mathematical accounts of phenomena (van Dyck 2005).
Only then would empirical observations come into play. On the one
hand, this means that theories are answerable to particular cases.
Observations have probative value, such that &ldquo;one single
experiment&rdquo; might &ldquo;suffice to overthrow&rdquo; a principle
(Galileo et al. 1960, 122). On the other hand, the justifications of
his principles ultimately rest on <em>a priori</em> grounds.
Intelligibility is more important than adequacy.</p>

<p>
There are many places in Galileo&rsquo;s work where he appeals to
actual observations to reject hypotheses. For example, he refutes
alternative explanations of the moon&rsquo;s secondary light (i.e.,
earthshine) in the <em>Starry Messenger</em> and of suspots in the
<em>Sunspot Letters</em> by comparing their predictions to what is
observed. But he also thinks that empirical confirmations can be
dispensed with. There is an emblematic example in the
<em>Dialogue</em>. Responding to the anti-Copernican objection that a
stone dropped from a tower would land to the west, left behind by the
Earth&rsquo;s eastward rotation, Galileo analogizes the situation to
dropping a stone from the mast of a uniformly moving ship, and holds
that the stone will conserve the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; horizontal
motion imparted by either ship or Earth before the drop and fall at
the base of the mast or tower. Thus, &ldquo;the experiment&rdquo; on
the ship or on the earth is inconclusive about the motion of either.
But when one of the characters in the <em>Dialogue</em> asks whether
Salviati has &ldquo;made a hundred tests, or even one,&rdquo; the
response is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Without experiment, I am sure that the effect will happen as I tell
you, because it must happen that way &hellip;. (Galilei 1967, 145)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Galileo is so confident that this account makes sense of the
phenomenon, experimental confirmation is superfluous. In sum, an
adverse result would refute the view, but such an experimental failure
is unintelligible.</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s ambivalence towards empirical evidence led some
commentators to think his method was entirely <em>a priori</em>
(Koyr&eacute; 1966). Subsequent studies of Galileo&rsquo;s manuscripts
showing his careful experimental practice have cast doubt on this view
(Drake 1978; Drake 1990; Settle 1967; Settle 1983; Settle 1992;
Palmieri 2008; B&uuml;ttner 2019). Other scholars have pointed to
artisanal practices as a source of Galileo&rsquo;s empirical method
(Renn 2005; Valleriani 2010; Peterson 2011), or to the influence of
contemporary responses to Aristotle, particularly the method of
<em>regressus</em> (Randall 1940; Wallace 1984; Wallace 1992; Miller
2018; but see Jardine 1976).</p>

<p>
Note that mathematical and empirical science is only possible if one
can reconcile the precision of calculations with the variability
observed in nature. For example, if the outcome does not exactly match
what is predicted, does that vitiate the theory? The reconciliation
necessitates an error theory that attributes deviations from
mathematical exactitude to &ldquo;impediments,&rdquo; like friction or
air resistance, that can be set aside in the empirical evaluation of a
mathematical theory. Galileo establishes such a method to defend his
mathematical conception of nature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Just as the computer who wants his calculations to deal with sugar,
silk, and wool must discount the boxes, bales, and other packings, so
the mathematical scientist (<em>filosofo geometra</em>), when he wants
to recognize in the concrete the effects which he has proved in the
abstract, must deduct the material hinderances, and if he is able to
do so, I assure you that things are in no less agreement than
arithmetical computations. The errors, then, lie not in the
abstractness or concreteness, not in geometry or physics, but in a
calculator who does not know how to make a true accounting. (Galilei
1967, 207&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nature really is as the mathematical principles have it. Any
discrepancy is the fault of &ldquo;hinderances,&rdquo; not the theory
itself. Conversely, a theoretical value is measured by controlling for
and ignoring the effect of perturbations in one or more observations.
As the quote above suggests, the idea perhaps derives from practical
mathematics or from observational astronomy, but Galileo is one of the
first to avow a version of this <em>sine qua non</em> of modern
scientific method. (See Koertge 1977; Bertoloni Meli 2004.)</p>

<h3 id="ThoughtExp">4.3 Thought Experiments</h3>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s appeals to observational evidence in his published
work typically serve to establish or demolish the intelligibility of
explanatory principles, descriptive categories, and so on. To this
end, it does not especially matter whether an experiment is carried
out in concrete experience or in the realm of imagination. One can
&ldquo;see&rdquo; what will happen either way, and the argumentative
effect is the same. Accordingly, Galileo&rsquo;s texts are full of
illustrative scenarios he does not pretend to have carried out.</p>

<p>
This feature of his rhetoric has made Galileo a <em>locus
classicus</em> in contemporary discussions of thought experiments. In
particular, the treatment of falling bodies in the First Day of the
<em>Dialogue</em> has been subjected to much analysis. Here, Galileo
uses a thought experiment to refute the Aristotelian theory of fall,
according to which the speed of a body&rsquo;s fall is proportional to
its weight. Galileo supposes that two bodies, one heavier than the
other, are suddenly conjoined in the midst of falling. On the one
hand, according to the Aristotelian doctrine, the faster fall of the
heavier body should be retarded by the slower motion of the lighter
body, so that the conjoined body will fall slower than the original
heavy body. And yet, the conjoined body is heavier than either
original body, so it should also fall faster. This &ldquo;short and
conclusive&rdquo; argument is meant to persuade the reader that there is an
incoherence in the Aristotelian account of motion.</p>

<p>
While much ink has been spilled about how this argument and others are
supposed to work (Gendler 1998; Norton and Roberts 2012; Brown and
Fehige 2023), it must be noted that much of this literature takes
Galileo&rsquo;s work out of its historical context, equating his
method with modern approaches and discounting the peculiar
sensitivities of his seventeenth-century audience. More historically
sensitive scholars have pointed out the wide variety of functions
thought experiments play in Galileo&rsquo;s work (Palmieri 2005;
Palmerino 2011; Camilleri 2015; Palmerino 2018; van Dyck 2005). In
sum, Galileo did not hold a unified doctrine of thought
experimentation, if he would have recognized the category at all. He
never intended his thought experiments to be read in any uniform way.
They are deployed to suit the dialectical needs of the moment.</p>

<h3 id="PrimSec">4.4 Primary and Secondary Qualities</h3>

<p>
There is another feature of Galileo&rsquo;s writing that has caught
the retrospective attention of modern scholars, even if it was
incidental to his own program: a distinction between primary and
secondary qualities. We find this in a passage of the <em>Assayer</em>
addressing the nature of heat, where Galileo denies that it is
&ldquo;a real attribute, property, and quality which actually resides
in the material by which we feel ourselves warmed&rdquo; (Galilei et
al. 1960, 309). He goes on to argue that there are certain qualities
that are inextricable from the concept of a corporeal body, while
others seem to inhere in the &ldquo;sensorium&rdquo; of a sentient
creature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Therefore I say that upon conceiving of a material or corporeal
substance, I immediately feel the need to conceive simultaneously that
it is bounded and has this or that shape; that it is in this place or
that at any given time; that it moves or stays still; that it does or
does no touch another body; and that it is one, few, or many. I cannot
separate it from these conditions by any stretch of my imagination.
But that it must be white or red, bitter or sweet, noisy or silent, of
sweet or foul odor, my mind feels no compulsion to understand as
necessary accompaniments. Indeed, without the senses to guide us,
reason or imagination alone would perhaps never arrive at such
qualities. For that reason I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so
forth are not more than mere names so far as pertains to the subject
wherein they reside, and that they have their habitude only in the
sensorium. Thus, if the living creature (<em>l&rsquo;animale</em>)
were removed, all these qualities would be removed and annihilated.
(Galilei et al. 1960, 309)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Corporeal bodies must have shape, location, a state of motion or rest,
contact or separation from other bodies, and number, since we cannot
conceive of a body without these features. But other sensory qualities
are not intrinsic to the conception of body itself. We suppose that
they arise only when bodies interact with the senses. For
instance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Those materials which produce heat in us and make us feel warmth,
which we call by the general name <em>fire</em>, would be a multitude
of minute particles having certain shapes and moving with certain
velocities. Meeting with our bodies, they penetrate by means of their
consummate subtlety, and their touch which we feel, made in their
passage through our substance, is the sensation which we call
<em>heat</em>. (Galilei et al. 1960, 312)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Material fire, that is, is not hot. It merely consists of bodies of
such shapes and motions that cause a sensory experience of heat when
they impinge upon a body.</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s position here aligns with his reconceptualization of
physical substance as essentially subject to mathematical description.
His primary qualities are the properties of mathematical volumes in
geometric space (as Descartes would later emphasize). At the same
time, Galileo is rejecting the standard Aristotelian account of
sensory qualities, which holds that they somehow inhere in the natures
of substances, and the relegation of quantification to the status of
mere accidents. But it should be noted that the passage is out of
character for Galileo, who is generally skeptical about our ability to
discern ultimate constitutions. More typical is a passage from the
<em>Sunspot Letters</em> where Galileo insists &ldquo;I consider
investigating the essence of the nearest elementary substances an
undertaking no less impossible and a labor no less in vain than that
of the most remote and celestial ones. &hellip; And likewise I do not
understand any more of the true essence of Earth or of fire than I do
that of the Moon or of the Sun&rdquo; (Galilei and Scheiner 2010,
254). Indeed, as noted, Galileo&rsquo;s epistemology emphasizes the
intelligible explanation of observed phenomena. To achieve this end,
he usually eschews speculation about essences as unnecessary and
irrelevant. Nevertheless, the passage above is generally recognized as
the first clear argument for the primary and secondary quality
distinction (Bolton 2025).</p>

<h2 id="GaliChur">5. Galileo and the Church</h2>

<p>
No account of Galileo&rsquo;s importance to philosophy can be complete
if it does not discuss the Galileo Affair&mdash;the sequence of
interactions with the Church that resulted in Galileo&rsquo;s
condemnation. The end of the affair is simply stated. In late 1632, in
the aftermath of the publication of the <em>Dialogue Concerning the
Two Chief World Systems</em>, Galileo was ordered to appear in Rome to
be examined by the Congregation of the Holy Office; i.e., the
Inquisition. In January 1633, a very ill Galileo made an arduous
journey to Rome. From April, Galileo was called four times to
hearings; the last was on June 21. The next day, June 22, 1633,
Galileo was taken to the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and
ordered to kneel while his condemnation was read. He was declared
guilty of &ldquo;vehement suspicion of heresy,&rdquo; and made to recite and sign
a formal abjuration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I have been judged vehemently suspect of heresy, that is, of having
held and believed that the sun in the center of the universe and
immoveable, and that the Earth is not at the center of same, and that
it does move. Wishing however, to remove from the minds of your
Eminences and all faithful Christians this vehement suspicion
reasonably conceived against me, I abjure with a sincere heart and
unfeigned faith, I curse and detest the said errors and heresies, and
generally all and every error, heresy, and sect contrary to the Holy
Catholic Church. (Shea and Artigas 2003, 194)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Galileo was sentenced to &ldquo;formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the
Inquisition,&rdquo; but this was commuted to house arrest, first in the
residence of the Archbishop of Siena, and then, from December 1633, at
his villa in Arcetri, under which condition he lived out his days.</p>

<p>
The details and interpretations of these proceedings have long been
debated. One point of controversy is the legitimacy of the charges
against Galileo, both in terms of their content and the judicial
procedure. Galileo was charged with teaching and defending the
Copernican doctrine that holds the sun is at the center of the
universe and the Earth moves. The status of this doctrine was cloudy.
In 1616, an internal commission of the Inquisition had determined that
it was heretical, but this was not publicly proclaimed. Instead,
Copernicus&rsquo;s book had been placed on the Index of Prohibited
Books as &ldquo;suspended until corrected.&rdquo; Even more confusingly, the
corrections had duly appeared in 1620, so the suspension was nominally
rescinded, but the book nevertheless remained on the Index until 1835.
In fact, the Church&rsquo;s first <em>public</em> pronouncement that
Copernicanism is a heresy appears in Galileo&rsquo;s condemnation.</p>

<p>
Galileo&rsquo;s own status was also problematic. In 1616, at the same
time that the Inquisition was evaluating Copernicanism, they were also
investigating Galileo personally&mdash;a separate proceeding of which
Galileo himself was not likely aware. The outcome was Cardinal
Bellarmine&rsquo;s admonition not to &ldquo;defend or hold&rdquo; the Copernican
doctrine. This &ldquo;charitable admonition&rdquo; may (or may not) have been
followed by a &ldquo;formal injunction&rdquo; &ldquo;not to hold, teach, or defend it in
any way whatever, either orally or in writing.&rdquo; When the records of
this disposition of the 1616 case were discovered in 1633, it made
Galileo appear guilty of recidivism, having violated the
Inquisition&rsquo;s injunction by publishing the <em>Dialogue</em>. It
has even been argued (Redondi 1983), that the charge of Copernicanism
was the effect of a plea bargain meant to cover up Galileo&rsquo;s
genuinely heretical atomism, though this latter hypothesis has not
found much support.</p>

<p>
To confound issues further, the case against Galileo transpired in a
fraught political context. Galileo was a creature of the powerful
Medici and a personal friend of Pope Urban VIII, connections that
significantly modulated developments (Biagioli 1993). There were also
pressures stemming from the Counter Reformation, the Thirty Years War,
and resulting tensions within Urban&rsquo;s papacy (McMullin 2005;
Miller 2008; McMullin 2009; Finocchiaro 2019).</p>

<p>
Historical context aside, the legitimacy of the underlying
condemnation of Copernicus on theological and rational grounds has
been a focus of philosophical concern. Galileo had addressed this
problem in 1615, when he wrote his <em>Letter to Castelli</em> and
then the <em>Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina</em>. In these
texts, Galileo argues that there are two truths: one derived from
Scripture, the other from the created natural world. Since both are
expressions of the divine Will, they cannot contradict one another.
However, Scripture and Creation both require interpretation in order
to glean the truths they contain&mdash;Scripture because it is a
historical document written for common people, and thus accommodated
to their understanding so as to lead them towards true religion;
Creation because the divine act must be distilled from sense
experience through scientific enquiry. While the truths are
necessarily compatible, biblical and natural interpretations can go
awry, and are subject to correction. Much philosophical controversy,
before and after Galileo&rsquo;s time, revolves around this doctrine
of the two truths and their seeming incompatibility.</p>

<p>
Bellarmine viewed Scripture as divinely inspired, of course, so its
literal interpretation must be maintained, even against scientific
inquiry, lest the Holy Spirit be accused of error. Since the stability
of the Earth is expressly in the several scriptural passages, one
should not assert its motion, except as a mere hypothesis. Bellarmine
was willing to accommodate Scriptural interpretation to scientific
truth if the latter could be proven or demonstrated (McMullin 1998).
But for Bellarmine, working in the Scholastic paradigm, scientific
proof was derived from causal principles known generally to be true.
To impugn the literal interpretation, a natural proposition had to
achieve the status of an established universal principle. Moreover,
Bellarmine thought that the planetary theories of Ptolemy and
Copernicus (and presumably Tycho Brahe) were merely mathematical
conceits. They could predict planetary positions, but they could not
indicate the physical structure of the solar system and were therefore
not even susceptible to scientific proof. This instrumentalist,
anti-realist position (Machamer 1976; Duhem 1985) went hand-in-hand
with the traditional distinction between mathematical and
philosophical disciplines. In the traditional hierarchy, physics could
constrain what models were really possible, but not so the other way
around. Galileo, by contrast, held that the planetary models
corresponded to physical realities. Empirical confirmations of the
Copernican model, and refutations of the Ptolemaic, therefore had
implications for their truth. Such proofs determined which causal
principles God could have realized, and thus which interpretations of
Scripture were legitimate. Consequently, inquiry into nature should be
left independent of Scriptural interpretation, lest the faithful fall
into dogmatic error.</p>

<p>
It did not help Galileo&rsquo;s case, though, that the proof he
offered was not very convincing. This was his flawed argument
concerning the cause of the tides, contained in <em>On the Ebb and
Flow of the Tides</em>, a manuscript he composed and circulated in
1616 while Copernicanism was under the Inquisition&rsquo;s scrutiny,
and the main thrust of which reappears in Day Four of the
<em>Dialogue</em> (see above for details). While one can see why
Galileo thinks he has some sort of proof for the motion of the Earth,
and therefore for Copernicanism, it is equally clear why Bellarmine
and others thought it did not rise to the level of established
principle.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, when the tidal argument was compounded with his earlier
telescopic observations showing the improbabilities of the older
celestial picture&mdash;the mountainous Moon, Jupiter&rsquo;s
satellites, the phases of Venus, and so on&mdash;and the
neutralization of physical arguments against a moving Earth&mdash;via
the principles of inertia and relativity&mdash;it was enough for
Galileo to believe that he could convince his opponents.
Unfortunately, people were not ready for such proofs until after
Galileo&rsquo;s death and the widespread acceptance of a unified
material cosmology, utilizing the characterization of matter and
motion elaborated in his <em>corpus</em>. But this could occur only
after Galileo had changed the acceptable parameters for gaining
knowledge and theorizing about the world.</p>
