Francis Bacon (1561&ndash;1626) was one of the most important
philosophers of the early modern period. He was a truly protean
figure&mdash;a lawyer by training and profession who advocated law
reform for over thirty years; a politician and statesman who sat in
parliament from the age of twenty until the age of sixty; a popular
essayist and historian whose <em>Essays</em> were printed more than
twenty times and <em>The Historie of the Raigne of King Henrie the
Seuenth</em> (1622) at least six times in the seventeenth century. But
before everything else, Bacon was a philosopher who had a profound
impact on the subsequent development of philosophy. The main endeavor
of his philosophical pursuits was creating a colossal program for
renewing all knowledge, especially natural philosophy. Bacon called
this program &ldquo;<em lang="la">Instauratio magna</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Great Instauration&rdquo;). It included a completely new aim
for natural philosophy and sciences. All knowledge, rather than being
only speculative and contemplative, should also be operative and
beneficial to humankind. Bacon is remembered for insisting that human
knowledge and power are closely connected. Another central aspect of
his program for renewing all learning and knowledge was the creation
of a new organon or method, often called eliminative induction, for
studying nature. Bacon allocated an important role in this new organon
to natural history, and his understanding of natural history, its
content and role, was novel. His program also included the idea that
knowledge and learning should be an institutional effort, that
learning could only be advanced by collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="LifPhiPolLaw">1. Life in Philosophy, Politics and Law</h2>

<p>
Francis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561 at York House in the Strand,
London, the second son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper, and his
second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke. Bacon received his
early education at home. On 5 April 1573 (when he had just turned
twelve), he went, together with his elder brother Anthony, up to
Trinity College, Cambridge, where they were tutored by the master, Dr
John Whitgift, the future archbishop of Canterbury. Bacon stayed in
Cambridge until December 1575. Although he followed a largely medieval
curriculum, humanism had brought about an emphasis on moral
philosophy, rhetoric and history, and thus on practical problems
rather than logical subtlety.</p>

<p>
Bacon was admitted at Gray&rsquo;s Inn in 1576 but went in September
1576 to France to accompany the ambassador, Sir Amias Paulet. He
stayed in France for two and a half years, mostly performing
diplomatic tasks but also studying civil law, the legal system rooted
in Roman law. Upon the news of his father&rsquo;s death, he returned
to London in the spring of 1579 and resumed his studies in
Gray&rsquo;s Inn. He made rapid progress, was admitted to the bar in
June 1582, became a bencher in 1586, was elected as a reader in 1587
and delivered his first lectures in 1588.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Bacon had embarked on a public career and was elected to
parliament in January 1581. Henceforth, he sat in every parliament
until 1621. In the 1580s and early 1590s, he was employed to
investigate English Catholics and supported the execution of Mary,
Queen of Scots, in the 1586&ndash;7 parliament. Around 1589, Bacon
wrote &ldquo;An Advertisement Touching the Controversies of the Church
of England&rdquo;, which was widely circulated. He criticized both the
puritans and the bishops, reminding the former that, although
&ldquo;in Civill states, a republique is a better policy than a
kingdome&rdquo;, hierarchy was more suitable to the church than
&ldquo;the parity and equallity&rdquo;. As to the bishops, they were
the &ldquo;principall causes &hellip; of scismes &amp;
divisions&rdquo; (OFB I: 177, 169).</p>

<p>
From the early 1590s come the first indications of Bacon&rsquo;s
hitherto invisible philosophical interests. In a famous letter to Lord
Burghley in 1591, he announced that &ldquo;I have as vast
contemplative ends, as I have moderate civil ends&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;I have taken all knowledge to be my province&rdquo;. He
mentioned his plans to reform knowledge and to &ldquo;bring in
industrious observations&rdquo; and &ldquo;profitable
inventions&rdquo; (SEH VIII: 109). In a writing from the same time, he
even called knowledge &ldquo;the worthiest power&rdquo; (OFB I: 247,
262).</p>

<p>
During the 1590s Bacon became close to Robert Devereux, second earl of
Essex, who employed him in intellectual and literary pursuits and who
campaigned on his behalf for a government office. This campaign came
to nothing because of Bacon&rsquo;s notorious speech in the 1593
parliament against the government&rsquo;s subsidy bill. However, Queen
Elizabeth made him one of her learned counsels in July 1594, and he
was employed in several legal cases. In February 1597, Bacon published
his first edition of the <em>Essayes</em>, together with <em>Religious
Meditations</em> and <em>Places of Perswasion and Disswasion</em>. He
also devoted time to the idea of law reform. When Essex, having fallen
from power, made his forlorn attempt at a rebellion, the queen used
Bacon as a prosecutor in the subsequent trial and called upon him to
write its official account.</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1603, James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I to
the English throne as James I, and Bacon made a determined effort to
gain the king&rsquo;s favor. He was knighted in July 1603 and
published a tract on the pacification of the church and another on the
union of England and Scotland in 1603. He promoted the king&rsquo;s
plan for the union of the two kingdoms, both within and without
parliament. This paid off, and he was appointed solicitor-general in
June 1607. A year before, in May 1606, Bacon married Alice Barnham
(1592&ndash;1650). He was forty-five, she was barely fourteen.</p>

<p>
During these early years of the new reign, Bacon also developed his
philosophical projects. In October 1605, he published <em>The Twoo
Bookes of Francis Bacon: Of the Proficience and Advancement of
Learning, Divine and Humane</em>. Whereas book one offered a powerful
defense and eulogy of learning, book two surveyed the state of human
knowledge and especially its deficiencies. At the same time, Bacon
wrote numerous other philosophical writings, which, though they were
not published, demonstrate that his great philosophical program was
taking shape. The term &ldquo;Instauratio magna&rdquo; appeared for
the first time (ca. 1602&ndash;3). In these writings, Bacon began to
conceive his philosophical plan as consisting of six parts, aimed at
developing his novel methodology, providing his first account of his
famous doctrine of idols, and emphasizing the centrality of natural
and experimental history to the new natural philosophy. He noted in a
letter of 1609 that he was &ldquo;slowly&rdquo; writing &ldquo;a just
and perfect volume of philosophy&rdquo; (SEH XI: 141). In addition to
these works, Bacon published <em lang="la">De sapientia veterum</em>,
a collection of ancient myths and his interpretations of them, also in
1609.</p>

<p>
During the 1610s, Bacon was increasingly busy with legal and political
duties. This was reflected in his rising position. He was appointed
attorney-general in October 1613, sworn a privy councilor in June
1616, appointed lord keeper in March 1617, elevated to lord chancellor
in January 1618 and in the following July created Baron Verulam. A
powerful statesman and the most eminent lawyer in the country, Bacon
was clearly at the pinnacle of his political and legal career. In
January 1621, he celebrated his sixtieth birthday and was created
Viscount of St Alban. Alas, it did not last long. In the spring of
1621, parliament impeached Bacon for taking bribes, and rather than
defending himself, he confessed. He was a victim of a political
campaign against the king&rsquo;s chief favorite, the marquess (later
duke) of Buckingham. Bacon was briefly imprisoned in the Tower.</p>

<p>
Despite his growing legal and political work, Bacon managed to keep up
his intellectual pursuits during the 1610s. He published the second,
enlarged edition of the <em>Essaies</em> at the end of 1612. He had
also worked on his natural philosophical project, and in October 1620
the volume that guaranteed Bacon&rsquo;s rightful place in the history
of philosophy came out&mdash;the <em lang="la">Instauratio magna</em>.
The volume consists of the preface to the entire <em lang="la">Instauratio
magna</em>, the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; of the <em lang="la">Instauratio
magna</em>, two books of the <em>Novum
organum</em>, &ldquo;A Preparative for a Natural and Experimental
History&rdquo; and &ldquo;Catalogue of Particular History&rdquo;. In
this volume, Bacon was participating in contemporary European
philosophy. He sent three copies to the English diplomat in Vienna
Henry Wotton, who, acknowledging their receipt in December 1620,
promised Bacon to present the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler with a
copy (Jardine 2000: ix&ndash;x).</p>

<p>
The impeachment forced Bacon to retire. Although he continually
entertained hopes of a political comeback, he devoted the rest of his
life to literary and philosophical pursuits. He published <em>The
Historie of the Raigne of King Henry the Seventh</em> in March 1622,
returned to his plans for a law reform and brought out the third
edition of <em>The Essayes</em> in April 1625. Nevertheless, Bacon
devoted most of his time to natural philosophy, publishing in November
1622 the first installment of his natural history project&mdash;<em lang="la">Historia
naturalis et experimentalis</em>&mdash;containing a
natural history of winds, <em lang="la">Historia ventorum</em>. In
January 1623 his <em lang="la">Historia vitae et mortis</em> [History
of Life and Death] came out; and in October 1623 he brought out an
expanded Latin version of <em>The Advancement of Learning</em>, under
the title <em lang="la">De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum libri
IX</em>. <em lang="la">Sylva sylvarum</em>, a vast collection of
natural histories in English, and Bacon&rsquo;s utopia, <em>New
Atlantis</em>, were posthumously published in 1626. Bacon died at
Highgate on 9 April 1626.</p>

<h2 id="CriEarPhi">2. Criticism of Earlier Philosophy</h2>

<p>
An enduring element of Bacon&rsquo;s philosophical writings was his
fierce criticism of his ancient and more recent predecessors. He
wanted, Bacon wrote in the early 1590s, to &ldquo;purge&rdquo;
knowledge &ldquo;of two sorts of rovers&rdquo;, meaning robbers or
plunderers, to eliminate not only &ldquo;frivolous disputations,
confutations, and verbosities&rdquo; of scholasticism but also
&ldquo;blind experiments and auricular traditions and
impostures&rdquo; of alchemists (SEH VIII: 109). The result had been a
marriage between &ldquo;vaine nocions &amp; blinde
experimentes&rdquo;. It was &ldquo;the vniuersities of
<em>Europe</em>&rdquo; at whose door Bacon squarely placed the blame
for all this (OFB I: 263&ndash;5). He often repeated this criticism
(Gaukroger 2001: 39&ndash;40, 105&ndash;12; Zagorin 1998: 31&ndash;44;
Anderson 1948: 91&ndash;6, 106&ndash;11, 190&ndash;216).</p>

<p>
In <em>The Advancement of Learning</em> (1605), the target and style
of Bacon&rsquo;s criticism were different. He promised in Book One to
demonstrate &ldquo;the excellencie of learning and knowledge&rdquo;,
and especially &ldquo;the Augmentation and Propagation thereof&rdquo;
(OFB IV: 5). This meant mounting a robust defense of learning against
three types of adversaries&mdash;divines, politicians and the learned
themselves (Kiernan 2000: xvii&ndash;xiv; Zagorin 1998: 59&ndash;61).
Original sin and the Fall had not been caused by the aspiration to
knowledge of nature but by &ldquo;the proude knowledge of good and
euill&rdquo; (OFB IV: 6). As to politicians&rsquo; argument against
learning, Bacon portrayed it as a claim that learning would
&ldquo;soften mens mindes&rdquo; and thereby make them unsuited
&ldquo;for matter of gouernement and policie&rdquo; (OFB IV: 9).
Refuting this and arguing that learning and good government went
together, Bacon alleged that &ldquo;the Gouernements of Princes in
minority &hellip; haue neuertheless excelled the gouernement of
Princes of mature age&rdquo; (OFB IV: 11). This was a daring claim to
make, given that it was addressed to the 39-year-old James VI &amp; I,
who had become the king of Scotland at the age of one and had
announced his coming of age when he was 12 because of the disastrous
civil war and chaotic aristocratic rule of his minority.</p>

<p>
In his criticism of learned men, Bacon once again castigated
scholasticism and astrology, natural magic and alchemy. To these
familiar censures, he added &ldquo;delicate learning&rdquo;, by which
he denoted humanism, the revival of &ldquo;the ancient Authors, both
in Diuinitie, and in Humanitie&rdquo;. It had quickly led to excessive
admiration for &ldquo;eloquence&rdquo;. Although adroit use of
rhetoric was useful &ldquo;in ciuile occasions&rdquo;, in philosophy,
it was outright harmful (OFB IV: 21&ndash;3). In Book Two of <em>The
Advancement of Learning</em>, Bacon further censured current
institutions of learning, especially universities (Zagorin 1998: 61;
Anderson 1948: 19&ndash;22). They concentrated far too much on
professional training (in the faculties of theology, medicine and law)
at the expense of the &ldquo;Artes and Sciences at large&rdquo;.
Although &ldquo;learning should bee referred to action&rdquo;, and
those higher faculties were doing that, their teaching must be
grounded on &ldquo;Philosophie and Vniversalitie&rdquo;, which were
taught in the lower faculty of philosophy. It was precisely this
neglect of &ldquo;these Fundamental knowledges&rdquo; which
&ldquo;hindered the progression of learning&rdquo;, Bacon argued (OFB
IV: 57). Nevertheless, the greatest error of the learned themselves
was &ldquo;the mistaking or misplacing of the last or furthest end of
knowledge&rdquo;. The only true aim should be &ldquo;the glorie of the
Creator, and the reliefe of Mans estate&rdquo; (OFB IV:
31&ndash;2).</p>

<p>
In the <em>Instauratio magna</em>, Bacon repeated and elaborated on
this criticism (Rees 2004: xliii, lvii&ndash;lxi). He stated at the
outset that &ldquo;those who have dared &hellip; to lay down the law
of nature &hellip; have done terrible damage to philosophy and the
sciences&rdquo; (OFB XI: 53). The reproach of Aristotle and the
alchemists was repeated. Bacon summarized his criticism of the
Aristotelians and the alchemists with a well-known simile. Whereas the
alchemists or &ldquo;empirics&rdquo; had been like &ldquo;the ant,
only to store up and use things&rdquo;, the Aristotelians or
&ldquo;dogmatists&rdquo; had been like &ldquo;spiders, spin webs from
their own entrails&rdquo;. The proper natural philosopher should
proceed in the way of &ldquo;the bee&rdquo;&mdash;to gather material
from the flowers and then &ldquo;to convert and digest it&rdquo; (NO
I: 95; OFB XI: 153).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Reverence for antiquity&rdquo; was a great hindrance to the
progress of the sciences, Bacon maintained and declared that
&ldquo;our own time&rdquo; was &ldquo;the greater age of the
world&rdquo; and had &ldquo;countless experiments and observations
which have been built up and stockpiled&rdquo; (NO I: 84; OFB XI:
133). What his age had received from the Greeks was, therefore,
nothing but &ldquo;the boyhood of science;&rdquo; it was
&ldquo;productive of controversies [but] barren in works&rdquo; (OFB
XI: 11). The Greeks&rsquo; wisdom had been &ldquo;professorial and
poured forth in disputations&rdquo;, which was &ldquo;inimical to the
investigation of the truth&rdquo; (NO I: 71; OFB XI: 113). One result
of this was the useless disputations of scholasticism, but Bacon also
highlighted a novel, far-reaching consequence&mdash;the lack of
interest in natural philosophy. In both ancient Greece and Rome,
ethics and politics had dominated philosophy with the consequence that
natural philosophy had merely performed &ldquo;the role of a
servant&rdquo; (NO I: 80; OFB XI: 127).</p>

<p>
Bacon was acutely aware of the severity of his criticism, noting that
it might be objected it was &ldquo;remarkably harsh that I should oust
all sciences and all authors&rdquo;. But he assured his readers that
the mistakes had been so fundamental that there was no other way than
to start from scratch (NO I: 122; OFB XI: 183&ndash;5). As he
announced in a famous passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the only course left was to try to do everything again with better
assistance, and undertake a wholesale <em>Instauration</em> of the
sciences, arts and all human learning, raised on proper foundations.
(OFB XI: 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The things he was proposing were nothing less than &ldquo;quite new in
their very kind&rdquo; (OFB XI: 7).</p>

<h2 id="KnoWorPow">3. Knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;the worthiest power&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
The central aim of all knowledge, Bacon argued throughout his career,
should be the production of practical effects, the improvement of the
conditions of human life (Rossi 1996: 34&ndash;7; Gaukroger 2001:
16&ndash;18, 155&ndash;9; Serjeantson 2017: 344&ndash;8). When he
announced his philosophical ambitions in the early 1590s, these were
Bacon&rsquo;s central concerns. &ldquo;The true ends of
knowledge&rdquo; were &ldquo;industrious observations, grounded
conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries&rdquo;, he
wrote. He was impelled in this, he clarified, by
&ldquo;<em>philanthropia</em>&rdquo; (SEH VIII: 109). Perhaps
Bacon&rsquo;s best-known idea is that knowledge and power are closely
linked. He noted in the early 1590s that &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; was
&ldquo;the worthiest power&rdquo;, which should produce &ldquo;worthie
effects &amp; to endow the life of man with infinite new
Commodities&rdquo;, citing printing, artillery and the compass as
examples of earlier inventions (OFB I: 247, 262; Weeks 2008,
142&ndash;3). After reviewing the current state of knowledge, Bacon
drew the inescapable conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the Soueraignetie of man lyeth hidd in knowledge, wherein many things
are reserued which kings with their treasures cannot buy nor with
theire forces Commande. (OFB I: 265)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The powers of knowledge were mightier than those of politics.</p>

<p>
As Bacon&rsquo;s philosophical thinking progressed, these values
remained at its core. The only true end of knowledge was, he asserted
in 1603, &ldquo;a restitution and reinvesting &hellip; of man to the
sovereignty and power &hellip; which he had in the first state of
creation&rdquo; (SEH III: 222). <em>The Advancement of Learning</em>
drove home the same upbeat message. The only true end of learning was
its &ldquo;benefite and vse&rdquo;, &ldquo;the reliefe of Mans
estate&rdquo; (OFB IV: 31&ndash;2). Again, knowledge was said to be
the highest power, it even approached &ldquo;to the similitude of the
diuine rule&rdquo; (OFB IV: 51).</p>

<p>
In the <em>Instauratio magna</em>, Bacon&rsquo;s conviction about the
true aim of knowledge had only strengthened. The volume would explain,
Bacon told his readers, how &ldquo;the mind [could] exert its proper
authority over the nature of things&rdquo; (OFB XI: 11). The true end
of knowledge was &ldquo;the benefit and use of life, and that it be
perfected and regulated in charity&rdquo; (OFB XI: 23). Earlier
generations had greatly underrated the &ldquo;power&rdquo; knowledge
would bring about, Bacon maintained and famously declared that
&ldquo;human knowledge and human power come to the same thing&rdquo;
(NO I: 3; OFB XI: 65). The overall aim of the <em>Novum organum</em>
was to explicate the tool by which humankind could seize and wield
this power. &ldquo;My object&rdquo;, Bacon contended, &ldquo;is to see
whether I can really lay firmer foundations for human power and
prestige, and to extend their bounds yet wider&rdquo; (NO I: 116; OFB
XI: 175). Truth and usefulness were identical. The benefits and
usefulness of natural philosophy were not only its true end but also a
clear indication of truth: &ldquo;the discovery of fruits and works as
it were guarantees and underwrites the truth of philosophies&rdquo;
(NO I: 73; OFB XI: 117). Indeed, &ldquo;truth and utility are &hellip;
the very things themselves&rdquo; (NO I: 124; OFB XI: 187).</p>

<h2 id="InsMag">4. <em>Instauratio magna</em></h2>

<p>
At the heart of Bacon&rsquo;s philosophical <em>oeuvre</em> was his
massive program for the renewal of all knowledge and learning, natural
philosophy and sciences. The overall purpose of Bacon&rsquo;s program
was to completely replace the earlier philosophies he criticized and
to demonstrate how the practical effects he was proclaiming to be its
true end could be achieved&mdash;how knowledge and power could merge.
The program developed greatly from Bacon&rsquo;s ideas of the 1590s to
his writings in the early 1620s, but many key values and aims
remained. He talked about six books as early as 1607&ndash;11, which
by 1612 became six parts.</p>

<p>
Bacon often insisted that knowledge and its advancement would be
impossible without hope, and the <em>Novum organum</em> contains a
long section where he expounded on the importance of hope (NO I:
92&ndash;114; OFB XI: 149&ndash;73). Several factors were underlying
the lack of hope, including contentment with little and &ldquo;lack of
ambition&rdquo;, but mainly despair and the assumption that hope was
impossible. (NO I: 71&ndash;91; OFB IX: 113&ndash;49). Bacon aimed to
act as a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; out of such despair, to convince others
that a new beginning was needed and that his great instauration was
not &ldquo;limitless and beyond the capacity of mere mortals&rdquo;
(OFB XI: 25).</p>

<p>
In the <em>Instauratio magna</em>, Bacon described the six parts:</p>

<ol>

<li>The Partitions of the Sciences.</li>

<li>Novum Organum, or Directions concerning the Interpretation of
Nature.</li>

<li>Phenomena of the Universe, or Natural and Experimental History for
the building up of Philosophy.</li>

<li>The Ladder of the Intellect.</li>

<li>Precursors, or Anticipations of the Philosophy to Come.</li>

<li>The Philosophy to Come, or The Active Science.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Part I was to present Bacon&rsquo;s partition or classification of the
sciences. It would include the current state of learning and the
sciences but also explore things that have hitherto been omitted or
missed. Part II was planned to offer Bacon&rsquo;s new logic of
induction to replace the old syllogistic logic and thus to provide the
method to be adopted in the &ldquo;Interpretation of Nature&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Active Science&rdquo;. Part III would consist of the
collections of natural-historical data. It would establish &ldquo;the
foundations for the building up of philosophy&rdquo;, supply
&ldquo;the matter for knowledge&rdquo;, and thereby guarantee that the
whole project would start &ldquo;from the things themselves&rdquo;.
Bacon was familiar with earlier natural histories but confident that
his was &ldquo;a new kind and construction&rdquo; (OFB XI: 37). Part
IV was intended to provide examples of Part II in action. They would,
Bacon promised, disclose the entire process of inquiry or expose to us
&ldquo;the whole process the mind goes through, and the seamless
fabric and order of investigations in specific subjects&rdquo; (OFB
XI: 43). He pointed out that Part IV would contain &ldquo;tables of
discovery&rdquo;, which would enable &ldquo;anyone of moderate insight
and resourcefulness&rdquo; to see &ldquo;intimations and
specifications of many noble works&rdquo; (NO I: 117; OFB XI: 177).
There are a few brief texts intended for this part (Rees 2000:
xx&ndash;xxi). Part V was meant to offer anticipations, which had been
reached not by &ldquo;the true form of interpretation&rdquo; but by
the ordinary use of reason (OFB XI: 45; Rees 1996a: xix). For Part V,
Bacon only managed to write a preface (Rees 2000: xxi). The final Part
VI was to reveal and expound &ldquo;the philosophy drawn from and
established on the kind of legitimate, chaste and rigorous form of
investigation&rdquo;. It would, in other words, bring the two goals of
knowledge and power together (OFB XI: 45).</p>

<h3 id="DivSci">4.1 Division of the Sciences</h3>

<p>
Bacon had offered a division of the sciences in Book Two of <em>The
Advancement of Learning</em> in 1605, but this had been written before
he conceived the project as consisting of six parts. When he did so,
he revised the division but only accomplished it in <em>De augmentis
scientiarum</em> in 1623 (Kusukawa 1996; Anstey 2012; Gaukroger 2001:
18&ndash;20; Zagorin 1998: 61&ndash;8). Bacon first divided
man&rsquo;s understanding into three parts&mdash;memory, imagination
and reason, corresponding to history, poetry and philosophy
respectively. He further divided history into natural, civil,
ecclesiastical and literary history, the last of which dealt with the
history of learning. In philosophy, there were also three
parts&mdash;divine, natural and human. Natural philosophy had
theoretical and operative parts, or &ldquo;natural science&rdquo; and
&ldquo;natural prudence&rdquo;. Natural science was further divided
into physics and metaphysics, where physics focused on material and
efficient causes and metaphysics on formal and final causes. Natural
prudence had corresponding parts in mechanics and natural magic. Bacon
described physics and metaphysics, together with natural history, as
forming a pyramid, where natural history was the basis, physics in the
middle, and metaphysics on the top.</p>

<p>
The partitions of human philosophy were more complicated. First Bacon
made a division between the knowledge of man &ldquo;segregate&rdquo;
and &ldquo;congregate&rdquo;, and further distinguished in the former
between the body and the mind. The knowledge concerning the body had
four parts: medicine, cosmetics, athletics and voluptuary. The
knowledge concerning the mind had two parts&mdash;the substance or
nature of the mind and its use and its &ldquo;faculties or
functions&rdquo;, the latter of which was further divided into logic
or &ldquo;the <em>Arts intellectual</em>&rdquo; and ethics. Logic had
four parts: invention, judgment, memory and elocution; ethics had two:
the nature of good and the culture of the mind. Finally, there was
&ldquo;civil knowledge&rdquo;, which was about man &ldquo;congregate
or in society&rdquo; and which had three parts: conversation,
negotiation and government.</p>

<p>
Bacon argued that &ldquo;all partitions of knowledges&rdquo; should
not mean erecting impassable barriers between them; they were mere
&ldquo;<em>lines &amp; veines</em>&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;<em>separations</em>&rdquo; so that &ldquo;the continuance and
entirenes of knowledge be preserued&rdquo; (OFB IV: 93). This was in
line with his concept of &ldquo;PHILOSOPHIA PRIMA&rdquo; or
&ldquo;vniversal Science&rdquo; (OFB IV: 76), which examined
&ldquo;all such axioms as are not peculiar to any of the particular
sciences but belong to several of them in common&rdquo; (SEH IV: 337).
Despite the unity of all branches of knowledge, there are noticeable
differences between natural and human philosophy in his partitions of
knowledge. Natural philosophy was neatly divided into two theoretical
parts (physics and metaphysics) with the corresponding operative parts
(mechanics and magic), but human philosophy had no such structure.
Moreover, whereas natural philosophy formed a pyramid, neither human
philosophy in general nor its sections did so.</p>

<h3 id="NewOrg">4.2 The New Organon</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Novum Organum, or Directions concerning the Interpretation of
Nature&rdquo; constituted Part II of Bacon&rsquo;s great instauration.
It took its title from Aristotle&rsquo;s works on logic, the
&ldquo;Organon&rdquo;, which it endeavored to replace. Bacon had
repeatedly emphasized that such a new logic was at the center of his
philosophical pursuits (SEH III: 235&ndash;41), and the <em>Novum
organum</em> presented his most comprehensive account of this part. He
reminded his readers that just as sailors needed the compass to cross
the ocean, so in natural philosophy, &ldquo;a sound policy&rdquo; [<em lang="la">certa
ratione</em>] was a necessity to &ldquo;get at the
more distant and hidden aspects of nature&rdquo; (OFB XI:
19&ndash;21). His logic, Bacon wrote, differs from &ldquo;ordinary
logic&rdquo; in three particular ways: &ldquo;in its end, order of
demonstration, and the inquiry&rsquo;s starting point&rdquo; (OFB XI:
29). Bacon identified four faults his new logic intended to rectify:
the deceitfulness of senses, the unsoundness of concepts, the poverty
of induction and most importantly, that &ldquo;the means of
discovering and testing&rdquo; was &ldquo;the very mother of
error&rdquo; (NO I: 69; OFB XI: 111). Given that the current
&ldquo;route&rdquo; was &ldquo;altogether wrong and impassable&rdquo;,
what was needed, Bacon declared, was &ldquo;a route running direct
from the sense itself&rdquo;&mdash;the new organon (NO I: 82; OFB XI:
129). The aim of the novel road was &ldquo;not the discovery of
arguments but of arts&rdquo;, to acquire &ldquo;certain and ostensive
knowledge&rdquo; and thus &ldquo;to conquer nature in operation&rdquo;
(OFB XI: 29, 59).</p>

<p>
The first thing to do was to remedy the senses&rsquo; defectiveness
and deceitfulness. One way of doing this was by experiments and
instruments. Experiments should be devised and applied for a specific
question so that &ldquo;the sense judges only the experiment whereas
the experiment judges the thing&rdquo; (OFB XI: 35). Furthermore,
Bacon developed his famous doctrine of &ldquo;idols&rdquo; as part of
his true induction to remedy the deceitfulness of the senses (Rees
2004: li&ndash;lvii; Urbach 1987: 83&ndash;106; Gaukroger 2001:
83&ndash;106, 123&ndash;7; Zagorin 1998: 66&ndash;8, 82&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
There were no less than four such idols. The first, &ldquo;<em>Idols
of the Tribe</em>&rdquo;, was founded in &ldquo;human nature&rdquo;.
It was misleading to assume that the senses mirrored the world
accurately. On the contrary, they were like an enchanted glass and
distorted objects (NO I: 41, 45&ndash;52; OFB XI: 79&ndash;81,
83&ndash;9). The second type Bacon named &ldquo;<em>Idols of the
Cave</em>&rdquo;. These were the illusions of the individual man.
Everyone was living as it were in their cave, and their education and
circumstances affected how they perceived things. This became highly
problematic when individuals brought their context to bear on
&ldquo;philosophy and general reflection&rdquo; (NO I: 42, 53&ndash;8;
OFB XI: 81, 89&ndash;93).</p>

<p>
Whereas the two first idols were inherent in human nature, the two
last ones were ultimately social in character. The third,
&ldquo;<em>Idols of the Market</em>&rdquo;, took its name, as Bacon
noted, &ldquo;from the mutual agreement and association of the human
race&rdquo; and was the greatest nuisance. It was an illusion imposed
by words that men used to describe reality. It was a common mistake to
assume that reason controlled words although the opposite was true.
Words were applied &ldquo;according to the capacity of ordinary
people&rdquo;, and their use made it impossible to describe nature
accurately (NO I: 43, 59&ndash;60; OFB XI: 81, 93&ndash;5).
&ldquo;<em>Idols of the Theatre</em>&rdquo;, the fourth illusion,
consisted of &ldquo;the dogmas of philosophers and misguided laws of
demonstrations&rdquo;. Bacon identified three detrimental
philosophies&mdash;Aristotelianism, empiricism and superstition (NO I:
44, 61&ndash;7; OFB XI: 81&ndash;3, 95&ndash;109).</p>

<p>
In his account of &ldquo;our method&rdquo; [<em>nostra ratio</em>],
Bacon underlined, on the one hand, the easiness of describing it but,
on the other, the difficulty of performing it. He compared it to a
machine that should be in control. The first rule was that the mind
should be strictly regulated throughout: &ldquo;from the very outset
to stop the mind being left to itself but to keep it under control,
and make the matter run like machines&rdquo; (OFB XI: 53, 55,
translation modified).</p>

<p>
The aim of Bacon&rsquo;s induction was, just like that of the old
syllogism, to produce demonstrable knowledge. The basic problem with
the syllogism was that axioms were its starting point; it flew, as
Bacon put it, &ldquo;from the sense and particulars to axioms of the
highest generality&rdquo; (NO I: 19; OFB XI: 71). Induction, by
contrast, was &ldquo;to educe axioms successively and step by step,
and not to reach the most general ones until last&rdquo; (OFB XI: 31).
Bacon dismissed induction by enumeration as &ldquo;a childish
thing&rdquo; and argued that &ldquo;what the sciences require is a
form of induction which will unbind experience and separate it out,
and reach necessary conclusions by proper exclusions and
rejections&rdquo; (OFB XI: 33). Hence, Bacon&rsquo;s induction is
often called an eliminative induction (Gaukroger 2001: 138&ndash;55;
Zagorin 1998: 97&ndash;103; Rees 2004: lxxii&ndash;lxxvii).</p>

<p>
The adoption of Baconian induction required the compilation of three
kinds of tables. The first was a table of presence: &ldquo;for a given
nature, we must submit <em>to the tribunal of the intellect</em> all
known <em>instances</em>&rdquo; of that nature (NO II: 11; OFB XI:
217). The second was a table of absence, which presents things when
the studied nature would be expected but was, in fact, absent (NO II:
12; OFB XI: 221; Malherbe 1996, 91). The third table was called
&ldquo;the <em>Table of Degrees</em> or <em>Comparative
Table</em>&rdquo; (NO II: 13; OFB XI: 237), in which the instance of
the investigated nature exists to a greater or lesser degree.
Bacon&rsquo;s example was the nature of heat. Whereas the first table
included the sun&rsquo;s rays as an instance of heat, the second table
included the moon&rsquo;s rays as a negative instance. Therefore,
light could be excluded as a possible form of heat. The idea of the
third table was the following: given that &ldquo;the form of a thing
is the very thing itself&rdquo;, it followed that &ldquo;the true
form&rdquo; must decrease &ldquo;when the nature itself
diminishes&rdquo; (NO II: 13; OFB XI: 237).</p>

<p>
Bacon summarized the procedure as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the first job of true <em>Induction</em> is to <em>Reject</em> or
<em>Exclude</em> individual natures which we cannot find in any
instance where the nature under investigation is present, but can find
in any instance where the given nature is absent, or find growing in
any instance when the given nature wanes, or waning when the given
nature grows. Then, once we have performed <em>Rejection</em> and
<em>Exclusion</em> in the right ways, the residue left &hellip; will
be a form affirmative, solid, and both true and well defined. (NO II:
16; OFB XI: 255)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The process of exclusion was the foundation of Bacon&rsquo;s
induction. His natural philosophy had a pyramidic shape&mdash;the
progress from natural history to physics to metaphysics meant a
development towards ever higher axioms. The same process of induction
should be applied to every stage. Knowledge starts from experience,
ascends to lower and middle axioms (physics) and then rises to more
general ones until it reaches &ldquo;axioms of the highest
generality&rdquo;, the knowledge of forms (metaphysics) (NO I: 19; OFB
XI: 71; Malherbe 1996: 76).</p>

<p>
Bacon devoted much of Book 2 of the <em>Novum organum</em> to what he
called &ldquo;prerogative instances&rdquo;. There were no less than
twenty-seven such instances. They would support the process from
preliminary findings to the actual forms by providing experimental
plans or structures. They would direct the investigation in the right
direction, and some of them have been seen as &ldquo;forerunners of
later standard scientific procedures&rdquo; (Jardine 2000:
xxi&ndash;xxv; Rees 2004: lxxv&ndash;lxxxix). Bacon used them in his
natural histories, especially in the <em>Historia densi et rari</em>
(Jalobeanu 2020).</p>

<p>
Physics and metaphysics were the theoretical parts of natural
philosophy, and mechanics and magic were their corresponding operative
parts. What was their role in this process? Every time axioms were
reached, it was time to employ the operative part. As Sophie Weeks has
pointed out, &ldquo;every ascent of the mind to an axiom&rdquo; was
followed by &ldquo;a descent via experimentation to things, thereby
guaranteeing the continual union of things (<em lang="la">res</em>)
and mind (<em lang="la">mens</em>)&rdquo; (Weeks 2008: 173&ndash;4).
The aim was, Bacon wrote, to extract &ldquo;from works and experiments
causes and axioms, and in turn from causes and axioms new works and
experiments&rdquo; (NO I: 117; OFB XI: 175). Bacon presented the
descent from lower and middle axioms as &ldquo;light-bearing
experiments&rdquo; [<em lang="la">experimenta lucifera</em>]. Their
role was primarily to refine axioms, and &ldquo;truth is discovered
not through discursive argumentation but through operative
(experimental) engagement with nature&rdquo; (Weeks 2008: 179). Once
the forms of nature have been reached, &ldquo;fruit-bearing
experiments&rdquo; [<em lang="la">experimenta fructifera</em>] could
be achieved. This is what Bacon meant when he said that truth and
utility are the same thing: &ldquo;For the discovery of fruits and
works as it were guarantees and underwrites the truth of
philosophies&rdquo; (NO I: 73; OFB XI: 117).</p>

<h3 id="NatHis">4.3 Natural Histories</h3>

<p>
Part III of the <em>Instauratio magna</em>, natural history, was
intended to form the basis of the entire project. Bacon considered
natural history of immense importance; it was a <em>sine qua non</em>
for the <em>Instauratio magna</em>. Even if all humankind dedicated
itself to philosophy and the world were full of universities, he
asserted, there would be no &ldquo;headway in philosophy and the
sciences &hellip; without a natural and experimental history&rdquo; of
the kind that he proposed (OFB XI: 453). In <em>Historia naturalis et
experimentalis</em> (1622), he set even greater store by natural
history and declared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
my <em>Organum</em>, even if it were finished, would not carry forward
the Instauration of the Sciences much without Natural History, whereas
Natural History without the <em>Organum</em> would advance it not a
little. (OFB XII: 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bacon not only wrote about natural history but also composed natural
histories, and earlier scholars focused on the former and ignored the
latter as hasty collections of disparate facts and speculations.
Recent scholarship has focused more on Bacon&rsquo;s actual natural
histories and has established their significance for understanding his
substantive natural philosophy and attempts to put his methodological
injunctions into practice.</p>

<p>
Bacon&rsquo;s criticism of earlier natural histories was severe. His
natural histories, he asserted, would be &ldquo;quite
different&rdquo;, they would be of a new kind with a new organization
(NO II: 27, I, 98; OFB XI: 295, 157). Whereas the conventional natural
history was used &ldquo;for the sake of knowledge of actual the
things&rdquo;, his would be &ldquo;the primary matter of philosophy,
and the basic stuff and raw material of true induction&rdquo; (OFB XI:
455), and he gave detailed instructions of how to compile such
histories. Historians have largely accepted Bacon&rsquo;s claim for
novelty (Jalobeanu 2012a).</p>

<p>
Earlier natural histories had been dominated by classification,
description and conservation of traditional knowledge, all of which
were discarded by Bacon. For him, natural histories were functional,
providing material for new natural philosophy. He divided natural
history into &ldquo;<em>History</em> of <em>Generations,</em> of
<em>Pretergenerations</em> [marvels] and of <em>Arts</em>&rdquo; (OFB
XI: 455). The first type examined nature in its ordinary course, the
second explored the &ldquo;IRREGVLARS of NATVRE&rdquo; (OFB IV: 63),
and the third he called &ldquo;<em>Mechanicall</em> and
<em>Experimental</em>&rdquo; history (OFB XI: 455). Natural histories
should not only be about bodies, substances and their characteristics
but also about qualities, virtues and motions, including
&ldquo;<em>Dense, Rare, Hot, Cold, Consistent, Fluid, Heavy,
Light</em>, and quite a few others&rdquo; (OFB XI: 39; Anstey 2012:
24), and Bacon&rsquo;s natural histories were not simple descriptions
of empirical data but mainly about qualities and virtues (Jalobeanu
2012a). Moreover, they
overlapped with natural philosophy and were &ldquo;doing theoretical
work themselves&rdquo; (Stewart 2012: 88).</p>

<p>
When Bacon listed the three areas of natural
history&mdash;generations, prodigies and arts, by far the most
important of these was the last one; it was &ldquo;the most radical
and fundamental towards natural philosophy&rdquo; (SEH IV: 297),
showing &ldquo;things in motion&rdquo; and leading &ldquo;more
directly to practice&rdquo; (OFB XI: 463). Since there were important
analogies between nature and artifice, experiments and mechanical
contrivances could disclose things that were hidden in nature (Weeks
2008: 157&ndash;9). &ldquo;The nature of things&rdquo;, Bacon
explained, &ldquo;shows itself more openly under the vexations of art
than in its natural freedom&rdquo; (OFB XI: 39).</p>

<p>
Baconian natural history was thus much more than mere empirical
fact-gathering; it was not only using experiments to establish facts
but also to test theories. And Bacon conducted experiments to do so.
He was intrigued by scientific instruments, including telescope,
microscope and calendar-glass, and even by using them in combination
(Rees 2004: xl&ndash;xlii). He also made &ldquo;the most striking
methodological innovation in his experiments&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the
introduction of a control group&rdquo; (Jalobeanu 2016a: 107). In his
natural histories, Bacon distinguished between &ldquo;mere
experimentation&rdquo;, blind or unguided experimentation on the one
hand, and &ldquo;literate experience&rdquo;, guided experimentation,
on the other. Whereas the former was conducted by mere empirics, the
latter was the domain of the true experimental philosopher (Jalobeanu
2016b). Including experiments in natural history indicates that, for
Bacon, there was no fundamental difference between nature and art
(Rees 2004: xli; Rusu 2012: 115; Weeks 2007).</p>

<h3 id="SciAct">4.4 <em>Scientia Actiua</em></h3>

<p>
The culmination of the <em>Instauratio magna</em> was its sixth and
final part called &ldquo;The Active Science&rdquo;. It formed the top
of the pyramid, whose basis was natural history. It was called
metaphysics, and had, ideally, acquired comprehensive knowledge of
forms. Only this knowledge of forms could yield the most powerful kind
of operative knowledge. Bacon maintained, throughout his life, that
knowledge and power belong together, that the acquisition of true
knowledge of nature would enable the production of infinite
commodities and that the knowledge of forms would re-establish
man&rsquo;s sovereignty over nature. This raises the question of
Bacon&rsquo;s notion of progress; or, to put it in another way: how
quickly could the knowledge of forms be gained, and would that
knowledge be complete, or was progress to be interminable?</p>

<p>
Sometimes, Bacon suggested that the whole project could be
accomplished quickly. He stressed the enormity of the completion of
natural histories, requiring &ldquo;an army of workers&rdquo;, but
immediately added that, despite being &ldquo;many-sided and
burdensome&rdquo;, it was possible to accomplish it &ldquo;in my
lifetime&rdquo;. Furthermore, once natural histories were fully
gathered, &ldquo;the investigation of nature and of all the sciences
will amount to but a few years&rsquo; work&rdquo; (OFB XI: 453).
Perhaps, then, Bacon&rsquo;s notion of progress was rather limited?
Elsewhere, however, he presented a different view. Salomon&rsquo;s
House, the scientific community of Bensalem, the society described in
the <em>New Atlantis</em>, had been founded 1900 years ago, and it was
still in full swing. The spectacular results of its research
notwithstanding, its fellows continued to &ldquo;raise the former
discoveries by experiments into greater observations, axioms, and
aphorisms&rdquo; (SEH III: 165). The principal objectives remained the
same: &ldquo;the knowledge of Causes, and secret motions of things;
and the enlarging of the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of
all things possible&rdquo; (SEH III: 156). Salomon&rsquo;s House had
been there for almost two millennia and was still making bold leaps in
the interpretation of nature.</p>

<p>
Bacon&rsquo;s idea of progress was from this perspective continuous
and indefinite. Underlying the immense power of &ldquo;Active
Science&rdquo; was his conviction that &ldquo;matter hides within its
&lsquo;fold&rsquo; [<em>plica</em>] the power to bring into being all
potential worlds&rdquo; (Weeks 2008: 145&ndash;6). Previously, this
potentiality of matter remained unexploited, but gaining ever fuller
knowledge of it opened endless possibilities to humanity. In 1603,
Bacon mentioned immortality as one possible result of his project, and
in <em>The Advancement of Learning</em>, he talked about &ldquo;the
power of Man vnto the greatest libertie, and possibilitie of workes
and effects&rdquo; (OFB IV: 85). By the time he published the
<em>Instauratio magna</em>, he had upped the ante. The end, he now
wrote, was such that &ldquo;men in their current situation and state
of mind may not be readily able to grasp&rdquo; (OFB XI: 45). With his
guidance, he announced, it would be possible to produce &ldquo;things
that have never been done before, things of the kind which &hellip;
human thought [could never have] dreamed of&rdquo; (NO II: 3; OFB XI:
203); he boldly predicted &ldquo;bodies in an entirely new guise and
as a kind of alternative universe or theatre of things&rdquo; (OFB XI:
455). Given that &ldquo;Active Science&rdquo; could, through full
knowledge of matter, bring about a different universe, it is not too
much to say, as Sophie Weeks has concluded, that &ldquo;the fruits of
Baconian natural magic (based on knowledge of forms) will be beyond
our wildest dreams&rdquo; (Weeks 2008: 192).</p>

<h2 id="SubNatPhi">5. Substantial Natural Philosophy</h2>

<p>
In his natural historical writings, Bacon spelled out his overall
understanding of the world, from the nature of the universe to the
minute reality on the Earth (this section is largely based on Rees
1996a and Rees 1996b; Gaukroger 2001: 193&ndash;212). According to
Bacon, the finite universe was full of matter, which was
&ldquo;eternal, unchanging, and the plenipotentiary source of all
things&rdquo; (Weeks 2008: 145). He divided matter into two general
categories&mdash;tangible (heavy) and pneumatic (weightless) matter.
Whereas the central Earth consisted almost entirely of tangible
matter, the celestial heavens were filled with pneumatic matter. There
was a frontier zone between these two pure regions where tangible and
pneumatic mixed.</p>

<p>
Bacon distinguished between two quaternions of matter: the Sulphur and
Mercury quaternions. Both tangible and pneumatic matter were also
divided into two. In the Sulphur quaternion, tangible substances were
subterranean Sulphur and terrestrial inflammable oily substances;
pneumatic substances were terrestrial fire (sublunary) and sidereal
fire (the heavenly bodies). In the Mercury quaternion the
corresponding substances were subterranean mercury and terrestrial
non-inflammable watery substance; air (sublunary) and ether (medium of
the heavenly bodies). The heavens were divided into three regions:
comets and the Moon; the planets and the Sun; and the fixed stars.
What distinguished the three regions of the heavens from one another
was the potency of sidereal fire. It became stronger the higher you
went so that in the region of the fixed stars, it dominated the ether
completely.</p>

<p>
To understand Bacon&rsquo;s theory of matter in the terrestrial
context, we need to pay attention to what have been called
&ldquo;intermediates&rdquo;. These intermediates were combinations of
members from both the Sulphur and Mercury quaternions. In so far as
the heaven of the fixed stars was concerned, the intermediate was a
combination of sidereal fire and ether, where the former was dominant.
On the lowest, subterranean level, the intermediate were salt(s),
subterranean, organic beings, combining Sulphur and Mercury.</p>

<p>
The terrestrial phenomena of minerals, plants and animals were
composed of tangible and pneumatic matter, both of which were a
mixture of the sulphureous and mercurial quaternions. The tangible
salts and juices of plants and animals were watery and oily, and they
had pneumatic matter (spirits) attached that was airy and fiery. Both
spirits and tangibles were material. There was a hierarchy amongst the
terrestrial bodies, which became more complex the higher you moved on
this scale; the lowest bodies were inanimate (metals and stones), the
non-living plants were in the middle and the living animals (including
humans) were on the top. The hierarchy was based on the organization
of spirits (pneumatic matter) inside the bodies. On the lowest level,
in inanimate bodies, spirits were cut off and not inflamed and
kindled. In animate bodies (both plants and animals), spirits were
branched into veins and were kindled and inflamed (Rusu 2018: 452).
Tangible matter was responsible for the species of a body, and its
function was to keep the spirit in the body. Pneumatic matter was the
major source of action in nature whose motion created new individuals
(Rusu 2018: 455; Jalobeanu 2018a: 469&ndash;75).</p>

<p>
Against the fundamental Aristotelian distinction between the sub- and
superlunary regions, Bacon argued that the diurnal motion was not
confined to the heavens. Although the speed of this motion decreased
the closer to the Earth it reached, it accounted for certain
terrestrial phenomena. There was a general westward motion of the air
because air, just like celestial ether, belonged to the Mercury
quaternion. But Bacon also explained the cycle of the tides by the
diurnal motion, which carried the seas westward, only to thrown back
by the corresponding land mass.</p>

<h2 id="SalHouInsSetForNatPhi">6. Salomon&rsquo;s House: Institutional Setting for Natural Philosophy</h2>

<p>
A distinctive feature of Bacon&rsquo;s natural philosophical
<em>oeuvre</em> was his conviction that he could not accomplish his
colossal project on his own. He was continually searching for
patronage but also emphasized the necessity of cooperation and
entertained the idea of a research institute. Bacon considered no form
of the state ideal for the advancement of learning; all of them had
&ldquo;some point of contrariety towards true knowledge&rdquo;.
Whereas &ldquo;monarchies incline wits to profit and pleasure&rdquo;,
republics incline &ldquo;to glory and vanity&rdquo; (SEH III: 252).
This did not, however, thwart him from seeking patronage. He dedicated
<em>The Advancement of Learning</em> to the king and called his
project &ldquo;<em lang="la">Opera Basilica</em>&rdquo; (OFB IV: 61).
The <em>Instauratio magna</em> was, likewise, dedicated to the king,
and Bacon now asked James to instigate &ldquo;the collecting and
perfecting of a true and rigorous natural and experimental
history&rdquo; (OFB XI: 9). No royal patronage was forthcoming,
however. James was well known for his erudition, but his interests in
learning were mainly directed to religious controversies (Kiernan
2000: xxxvii&ndash;lvi). He promised, upon receiving the volume, to
read it and even ask questions about its arguments; but his real view
of the <em>Instauratio magna</em> was &ldquo;that yt is like the peace
of God, that passeth all understanding&rdquo; (<em>Letters of John
Chamberlain</em>, II, 339). Bacon insisted on the need for patronage,
so much so that he even made some effort to seek papal support for
natural histories (Kiernan 2000: lv).</p>

<p>
Another source of help could be universities, and Bacon&rsquo;s
criticism of universities did not prevent him from trying to obtain
their aid. He sent copies of <em>The Advancement of Learning</em> to
the chancellors and other officials of both Cambridge and Oxford, but
eliciting no response, he decided to pursue help from younger scholars
(Kiernan 2000: xxxi&ndash;xxxvii). Bacon also cherished hopes for
international cooperation among European universities because they had
&ldquo;a kind of contract, fraternitie, &amp; correspondence&rdquo;
(OFB IV: 60). International collaboration required, however, peace,
and Bacon, in the early years of the seventeenth century, was sanguine
about the prospects, writing in a famous letter in 1609:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Myself am like the miller of Huntingdon, that was wont to pray for
peace amongst the willows; for while the winds blew, the wind-mills
wrought, and the water-mill was less customed. So I see that
controversies of religion must hinder the advancement of sciences.
(SEH XI: 137&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bacon also explored collaboration and its institutional form on a
smaller, but no less significant scale. Already in 1591, he thought
that a political position of power would enable the &ldquo;commandment
of more wits than of a man&rsquo;s own&rdquo; (SEH VIII: 109). In
1594, he argued for the founding of a perfect library, garden and
laboratory (OFB I: 598&ndash;9). He returned to such ideas in his
private notes in 1608, reminding himself of &ldquo;laying for a place
to command wytts and pennes&rdquo;, hiring four scholars to compile
natural histories and inviting &ldquo;many to contribute and
joyne&rdquo;. &ldquo;A college for inventors&rdquo; with a library and
laboratories should be founded. Funding should be available for
traveling and &ldquo;for experiments&rdquo;; cooperation with foreign
universities should be encouraged (SEH XI: 66&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Nothing came out of these plans. However, they received their most
distinctive expression in Bacon&rsquo;s <em>New Atlantis</em>. It is a
story of a utopian society called Bensalem, whose happiness was
brought about by Salomon&rsquo;s House&mdash;a scientific institution
&ldquo;dedicated to the study of the Works and Creatures of God&rdquo;
(SEH III: 145). Bacon described its laboratories, instruments and
&ldquo;the several employments and functions whereto our fellows are
assigned&rdquo;. Thirty-six fellowships are mentioned by their
different tasks (SEH III: 156).</p>

<p>
Many historians have argued that the nature of Bacon&rsquo;s
cooperative idea was based on his experience as a statesman and that,
therefore, it was elitist and hierarchical (Martin 1991: 105&ndash;40;
Leary 1994: 145&ndash;50; Ash 2004: 205&ndash;7). Bacon sometimes
expressed such views. In 1603, for instance, he planned to publish
some of his ideas &ldquo;to the world&rdquo; but others should be
reserved to &ldquo;some fit and selected minds, and kept
private&rdquo; (SEH X: 287). Nevertheless, he emphasized time and
again that the directions of the <em>Instauratio magna</em> would have
the effect of levelling men&rsquo;s wits. &ldquo;Although the forms of
Polities may be varied&rdquo;, he opined in the preface to the
<em>Instauratio magna</em>, &ldquo;the state of the sciences is
singular, and it has always been and will remain popular&rdquo; (OFB
XI: 15, translation modified). Commenting on the &ldquo;tables of
discovery&rdquo;, he wrote that &ldquo;anyone of moderate insight and
resourcefulness&rdquo; would see remarkable results in them (NO I:
117; OFB XI: 177). He was convinced that, once his precepts were
carefully adopted and implemented, the individual&rsquo;s
characteristics become immaterial. &ldquo;For my way of discovering
sciences&rdquo;, he clarified, &ldquo;nearly equalizes intellects and
leaves little to their brilliance, since it conducts everything
through the most certain rules and demonstrations&rdquo; (NO I: 122;
OFB XI: 185, translation modified).</p>

<p>
What about the structure of Salomon&rsquo;s House? There was a
division of labor between fellows based roughly in different stages of
Bacon&rsquo;s six-part system from &ldquo;Merchants of Light&rdquo;,
who traveled to foreign countries to find out about their recent
inventions, to &ldquo;Interpreters of Nature&rdquo;, whose task was to
formulate &ldquo;greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms&rdquo;
(SEH III: 165). Scholars have argued that this division of labor is
hierarchical, but this is not necessarily the case. It was a duty
roster. Nowhere did Bacon indicate that there was a hierarchy amongst
the tasks different fellows were expected to undertake.
Salomon&rsquo;s House appears to be non-hierarchical. The fellows held
&ldquo;divers meetings and consults of our whole number, to consider
of the former labours and collections&rdquo; (SEH III: 165). This
suggests that all the fellows, whatever their duty, participated in
the decision-making. This emerges even more clearly from the fact that
it was up to the fellows collectively to decide upon the publication
of the results of their inventions. As Bacon&rsquo;s narrator
explained:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We have consultations, which of the inventions and experiences which
we have discovered shall be published, and which not: and take all an
oath of secrecy, for concealing of those which we think fit to keep
secret: though some of those we do reveal sometimes to the State, and
some not. (SEH III: 165)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The fellows bore the awesome responsibility of their tall order
collectively.</p>

<h2 id="MorPolPhi">7. Moral and Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
The <em>Instauratio magna</em> pertained to all human knowledge,
including moral and civil philosophy. The position of moral and civil
philosophy in Bacon&rsquo;s colossal project was, however, awkward,
and their relationship with natural philosophy was strained.</p>

<p>
Bacon emphasized, as we have seen, that all sciences shared a stem,
<em>philosophia prima</em>, with common axioms. In the <em>Novum
organum</em>, he asked &ldquo;whether I speak of natural philosophy
alone, or whether I also speak of perfecting the other
sciences&mdash;logic, ethics and politics&rdquo;. He immediately
provided the answer: &ldquo;I do indeed mean it of all the things just
mentioned&rdquo; (NO I: 127; OFB XI: 191). Moreover, natural history
formed the basis of natural philosophy, and Bacon mentioned similar
histories for human philosophy. In the <em>Novum organum</em>, he
promised that there would be a &ldquo;history and tables of discovery
concerning anger, fear, shame and so on, and also ones to do with
examples of civil business&rdquo; as well as about &ldquo;the mental
motions of memory, composition and division, judgment, and the
rest&rdquo; (NO I: 127; OFB XI: 191). Although in &ldquo;A Preparative
to a Natural and Experimental History&rdquo;, he discussed natural
history alone, in the ensuing catalog of particular histories, he had
an extensive list of the histories of humankind. These included
several medical histories and such specific histories as
&ldquo;History of the feelings&rdquo;, &ldquo;History of intellectual
faculties&rdquo; and &ldquo;History of military matters&rdquo; (OFB
XI: 479&ndash;83). These, if completed, would have formed the
foundation of human philosophy just as natural histories were to form
that of natural philosophy (Peltonen 1996a: 293).</p>

<p>
This is clear enough, but several issues complicate it. To begin with,
&ldquo;surely affairs of state differ greatly from the arts&rdquo;,
Bacon wrote. The upshot was that changes in politics, unlike in
natural philosophy, were always highly problematic. In political
matters, &ldquo;even change for the better brings fears of disorder,
since civil government rests not on demonstration but on authority,
consent, reputation and opinion&rdquo; (NO I: 90; OFB XI: 147). More
importantly, in numerous writings, Bacon suggested that moral and
civil philosophy were guided by different methods than natural
philosophy. In around 1607, he criticized the syllogism and praised
induction but noted that the syllogism was well suited to
&ldquo;subjects which are based upon opinion like ethics and
politics&rdquo; (Farrington 1964: 89; SEH III: 607). He repeated the
same message in the <em>Instauratio magna</em>, writing that
&ldquo;the dialectic in current use&rdquo; was &ldquo;very properly
applied to civil questions and the arts which rest on conversation and
opinion&rdquo; (OFB XI: 19). In fact, Bacon went so far as to claim
that &ldquo;the philosophy we are introducing will be quite
useless&rdquo; for &ldquo;civil life&rdquo; [<em lang="la">vitae
ciuilis</em>] (OFB XI: 56).</p>

<p>
There is also a curious discrepancy between Bacon&rsquo;s optimism
over the enormous benefits natural philosophy would bring about and
his view of civil knowledge. Whereas the former would provide &ldquo;a
different universe of things&rdquo;&mdash;things people could not even
comprehend&mdash;the latter held no such promises. Nor did Bacon take
the potential societal benefits of natural philosophy into account in
his civil knowledge. The only glimpse we have of these benefits can be
found in the <em>New Atlantis</em>. Although he described neither the
political arrangements nor the social life of Bensalem in any detail,
there are some interesting clues in the story. The island community
and its inhabitants are repeatedly described as &ldquo;happy;&rdquo;
the people were &ldquo;full of piety and humanity&rdquo;, and the
place appeared to the visitors as &ldquo;this happy and holy
ground&rdquo; (SEH III: 134, 136). When one of the fathers of
Salomon&rsquo;s House came to the city, &ldquo;the street was
wonderfully well kept&rdquo;, and the people stood silently in an
orderly fashion. Even &ldquo;the windows likewise were not crowded,
but every one stood in them as if they had been placed&rdquo; (SEH
III: 155). Underlying this happiness and docility were no doubt the
benefits Salomon&rsquo;s House had provided. Indeed, when the visitors
wondered about the secrecy of the island, they were told that it was
&ldquo;a land of magicians&rdquo;. We should remember that the
operative part of metaphysics in the uppermost echelon of the Baconian
pyramid was magic. The visitors reacted exactly as Bacon had predicted
in the <em>Novum organum</em> that people would respond to the
inventions of &ldquo;Active Science&rdquo;. They could neither grasp
nor even dream of them and agreed that &ldquo;there was something
supernatural in this island&rdquo;. But for them, it was
&ldquo;angelical&rdquo; rather &ldquo;than magical&rdquo; (SEH III:
140).</p>

<p>
When Bacon examined moral and civil knowledge in both <em>The
Advancement of Learning</em> and <em>De augmentis scientiarum</em>,
such spectacular societal results of natural philosophy were nowhere
to be seen. Although &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; was listed in <em>De
augmentis scientiarum</em> as one of the areas of civil knowledge, it
had been &ldquo;excellently handled&rdquo; by earlier philosophers
(SEH V: 79), and Bacon had nothing to add to it. The far-reaching
effects of natural philosophy upon human life had no bearing on moral
and civil knowledge. The themes Bacon explored in these disciplines
were conventional topics in Renaissance moral and political philosophy
although his treatment of them was unconventional. Perhaps the most
obvious departure from the traditional view was his clear separation
of moral philosophy from civil philosophy, and his establishment of
civil knowledge as &ldquo;an entire doctrine by itself&rdquo; (SEH IV:
405). Moral philosophy was concerned with &ldquo;Internall goodnesse:
But ciuile knowledge requireth onelye an Externall goodnesse: for that
as to societye sufficeth&rdquo; (OFB IV: 156).</p>

<p>
Natural philosophy contained both theoretical (physics and
metaphysics) and operative parts (mechanics and magic). In moral
knowledge, there was a comparable separation between the
&ldquo;PLATFORME of GOOD&rdquo; and the &ldquo;CVLTVRE OF THE
MIND&rdquo;. The first described the nature of good, the second was
intended to prescribe rules how to attain it (OFB IV: 135). The nature
of good was again divided into two. Good could be &ldquo;a Totall or
substantiue in it selfe&rdquo;, but it could also be &ldquo;a parte or
Member of a greater Bodye&rdquo;. The latter was to be preferred
because the public was of far greater importance than the individual.
This distinction prompted Bacon to defend the active life vigorously
and to criticize several strands of moral philosophy, including
Aristotelianism, Epicureanism, skepticism and Stoicism for defending
the contemplative life (Peltonen 1995: 141&ndash;5). The culture of
the mind, the second part of moral philosophy, Bacon found woefully
deficient and provided some general remarks towards remedying it.
These included studying different characters and tempers of human
nature, as well as the impact of such factors as gender, age and the
locality.</p>

<p>
As to civil knowledge, Bacon observed in <em>The Advancement of
Learning</em> that &ldquo;in Ciuile matters there is a wisedome of
discourse, and a wisedome of direction&rdquo; (OFB IV: 80). These
seemed to correspond to the theoretical and operative parts of natural
philosophy. However, Bacon did not clarify this remark and, in fact,
withdrew it from <em>De augmentis scientiarum</em>. There was no
theoretical part of civil knowledge, no &ldquo;inquisition of
causes&rdquo; and no clue as to what such a theoretical part of civil
knowledge would have looked like (Peltonen 1996a: 294).</p>

<p>
Civil knowledge had three parts: &ldquo;Conuersation, Negotiation, and
Gouernment&rdquo;. The wisdom of conversation examined courtesy or
civility and their importance in life. Thinking most likely of such
courtesy books as Baldassare Castiglione&rsquo;s <em>The
Courtier</em>, Giovanni Della Casa&rsquo;s <em>Galateo</em> and
Stefano Guazzo&rsquo;s <em>The Ciuile Conuersation</em>, all published
in English in the latter part of the sixteenth century, Bacon observed
that &ldquo;this parte of Ciuile knowledge hath beene elegantlye
handled&rdquo;, and his account of it was very brief. Overall, he
agreed with the earlier authors and underlined the importance of our
outward behavior, reminding his readers that &ldquo;a man maie destroy
the force of his woords with his countenance&rdquo;. (OFB IV:
157&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The wisedome touching of Negotiation or businesse&rdquo; was
despised by learned men, for which reason it was a completely
neglected discipline. It aimed to teach how to be successful in
private and public life, and it had two parts. The former focused on
advising others, and Bacon used examples from King Solomon&rsquo;s
proverbs, with his brief explanations. The remit of the second part,
&ldquo;Architecture of fortune&rdquo; (OFB IV: 165), was, as the name
implies, how to advance one&rsquo;s career. Bacon defended this wisdom
against accusations of its worthlessness, underlining that it provided
&ldquo;an instrument&rdquo; for &ldquo;higher pursuits&rdquo; (SEH V:
59). His exemplary precepts offered cynical advice on how to carve out
a successful career (&Ccedil;akan forthcoming).</p>

<p>
The final part of civil knowledge was the wisdom of government. In
<em>The Advancement of Learning</em>, Bacon said this wisdom was
&ldquo;secret and retyred&rdquo;. It was both &ldquo;hard to
know&rdquo; but also &ldquo;not fit to vtter&rdquo;, and since he was
writing &ldquo;to a king that is maister of this Science&rdquo;, he
decided &ldquo;to passe ouer this part in silence&rdquo; (OFB IV:
179). By the time he published <em>De augmentis scientiarum</em>, his
view had changed. He still imposed silence on himself but could not
resist the temptation to use this occasion to attempt a political
comeback. &ldquo;Perhaps I might not be&rdquo;, Bacon wrote with
studied moderation, &ldquo;entirely unqualified to handle such topics
with some skill and profit, as being one who has had the benefit of
long experience&rdquo;. He backed this up by a brief assessment of his
political career and issued an equivocal forecast that if he was going
to write anything concerning &ldquo;political knowledge, the work will
perchance be either abortive or posthumous&rdquo; (SEH V: 78&ndash;9).
He now divided the wisdom of government into three parts: the
preservation, the happiness and prosperity and the extension of the
empire. The first two had been excellently treated, but Bacon made a
curious claim that &ldquo;nothing has been said on the last&rdquo;
(SEH V: 79) and provided an exemplary account of the topic.</p>

<p>
Bacon had been preoccupied by the theme of civic greatness for almost
twenty years. He had first mentioned it in an important speech about
naturalization of the Scots in the House of Commons in February 1607
(Peltonen 2012: 151&ndash;5). Around this time, he also wrote an
unfinished manuscript treatise on the true greatness of Britain and
published an essay &ldquo;Of greatnes of Kingdomes&rdquo; in the 1612
edition of <em>The Essaies</em>. The version in <em>De augmentis
scientiarum</em> was subsequently published in English in the final
edition of <em>The Essayes</em> in 1625 with the title &ldquo;Of the
True Greatnesse of Kingdomes and Estates&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Bacon&rsquo;s claim of novelty in 1623 was curious not so much because
of his earlier ventures into the topic but because in his treatise on
the true greatness of Britain (ca. 1608) he had specifically
emphasized that he was not the first author to explore this topic. He
began that treatise, he explained,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
by confuting the errors or rather correcting the excesses of certain
immoderate opinions, which ascribe too much to some points of
greatness which are not so essential, and by reducing these points to
a true value and estimation. (SEH VII: 48)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The most likely target of Bacon&rsquo;s criticism is relatively easy
to identify, for in 1606 there had appeared an English translation of
Giovanni Botero&rsquo;s <em>Delle cause della grandezza delle
citt&agrave;</em>, originally published in 1588. Botero discussed the
same topic in the introduction to another work, <em>Delle relationi
universali</em>. An edition with this introduction had been published
in English for the first time in 1601 (Botero 1601: 1&ndash;10). It is
worth noting that Bacon and Botero were closely entangled in the 1630
English edition of <em>Delle relationi universali</em>: the
introductory treatise on greatness was considerably enlarged and
silently incorporated parts of Bacon&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;Of the True
Greatnesse of Kingdomes and Estates&rdquo; (Botero 1630:
19&ndash;45).</p>

<p>
It bears emphasis that when Bacon wrote about the greatness of states,
he did not write about &ldquo;their preservation, happiness, and all
other points of well-being&rdquo;, as he had already explained in his
treatise on the true greatness of Britain (SEH VII: 49). These themes
formed their own subdisciplines (of the wisdom of government) and,
therefore, had nothing to do with civic greatness. The true estimation
of civic greatness was the most difficult topic in politics, and
errors in it would have the most &ldquo;perilous consequences&rdquo;.
What did Bacon&rsquo;s account of true greatness involve? He put all
his emphasis on military strength, on &ldquo;the valor and military
disposition of the people&rdquo; (SEH VII: 49). &ldquo;Above
all&rdquo;, he declared, &ldquo;for empire and greatness, it is of
most importance that a nation profess arms as their principal honour,
study, and occupation&rdquo; (SEH V: 84). True greatness was about
military expansion. Bacon repeated this in all of his writings on the
topic and stressed that all other aspects were subject to it. He also
listed &ldquo;the commandment of the sea&rdquo; as an important
element of true greatness (SEH V: 86; VI: 97&ndash;98; VII: 49), which
has prompted many scholars to assume that it was an Atlantic empire
that Bacon chiefly had in mind. However, it has recently been
persuasively argued that more daringly, he was mainly thinking about a
continental European empire, starting from the Netherlands
(Serjeantson 2024).</p>

<h2 id="NatPhiRelLaw">8. Natural Philosophy, Religion and Law</h2>

<p>
Scholars have long debated the relationships in Bacon&rsquo;s
<em>oeuvre</em> between natural philosophy on the one hand and
religion and law, on the other. Bacon was a lawyer by training and
profession and made a dazzling career in law. He also had a life-long
interest in reforming the law. Numerous scholars have suggested that
Bacon&rsquo;s legal and philosophical thought were closely connected
(Shapiro 1983: 168&ndash;9). More specifically, it has been argued
that his legal education and practice played a significant role in his
thinking about natural philosophy. As one scholar has put it:
&ldquo;Bacon&rsquo;s philosophy applied to nature the same model his
jurisprudence applied to the state&rdquo; (Wheeler 1983: 100).</p>

<p>
It is especially Bacon&rsquo;s ideas about natural philosophers
interrogating nature, even torturing it, that have been linked to his
legal thinking and practice. Although this link has been thought to be
fostered by his extensive experience in English common law, it has
recently been shown that it was, in fact, his considerable knowledge
of, and interest in, civil law that helped to shape some key aspects
of his natural philosophy. This is most obvious in his choice of
referring to the investigation of nature as an &ldquo;interpretation
of nature&rdquo;. As Richard Serjeantson has demonstrated, &ldquo;the
idea that nature might be &lsquo;interpreted&rsquo; was alien to the
mental world of the late Renaissance&mdash;alien, that is, until Bacon
proposed it&rdquo;. This choice of terminology was derived from civil
law tradition (Serjeantson 2014).</p>

<p>
Historians have also debated the relationship between religion and
Bacon&rsquo;s natural philosophy. Bacon frequently used religious
imagery in his philosophical writings. He drew a comparison between
religion and natural philosophy and pointed out that, just as in
religion, &ldquo;our faith&rdquo; is shown &ldquo;by works&rdquo;, so
natural philosophy should be judged &ldquo;by its fruits and, if it be
barren, let us regard it as empty&rdquo; (NO I: 73; OFB XI:
117&ndash;19). Not only did he draw close parallels between religion
and natural philosophy, but he also defiantly considered them to
cooperate in the repair of the Fall. Religion and faith could restore
the &ldquo;state of innocence&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the arts and
sciences&rdquo; could restore man&rsquo;s &ldquo;command over created
things&rdquo; (NO II: 52; OFB XI: 447).</p>

<p>
Some scholars have insisted that Bacon&rsquo;s use of religious
language and images in his natural philosophical writings was a mere
camouflage for his secularism and irreligiosity (White 1968;
Weinberger 1985). &ldquo;Bacon&rsquo;s real attitude toward
Christianity was a blend of scepticism, hostility, and
indifference&rdquo;, one interpreter has claimed (Paterson 1987:
422).</p>

<p>
Those who have made the opposite case have argued that we should take
seriously the pervasive religious imagery in Bacon&rsquo;s
philosophical writings centering around salvation and deliverance. The
term &ldquo;instauration&rdquo; entailed, among other things, the
restoration of humanity to its prelapsarian state. Bacon&rsquo;s whole
project of reforming natural philosophy was, these scholars have
insisted,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
drawn from the Judaeo-Christian scriptures, particularly the Genesis
account of the Creation and the Fall; from [the] apocalyptic
expectation of renewal in the Old Testament; and from soteriological
themes of the New Testament. (McKnight 2006: 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It has also been suggested that, early on, Bacon moved away from the
Puritan background of his mother and embraced High-Church Anglican
conformism. Lancelot Andrewes (1555&ndash;1626), a conformist scholar
and bishop, and Tobie Matthew (1577&ndash;1655), a Catholic, not only
were Bacon&rsquo;s close friends but had a considerable impact on his
religion and, thus, on his natural philosophy (Matthews 2008).</p>

<p>
Whatever the merits of these opposite positions, two things about the
relationship between Bacon&rsquo;s natural philosophy and religion are
widely accepted. First, he regarded &ldquo;the study of nature as a
truly religious activity&rdquo; (Gascoigne 2010: 215). &ldquo;Natural
philosophy, after the Word of God&rdquo;, Bacon asserted in the
<em>Novum organum</em>, &ldquo;is the best medicine for superstition
and most highly recommended food for faith&rdquo; (NO I: 89; OFB XI:
145). Second, he wanted to keep the study of nature and religion
strictly separated. Each would have a truly harmful effect on the
other (Gascoigne 2010: 216&ndash;18). Natural philosophy, moreover,
required peace to progress, but religious conflicts could easily
escalate into wars. Therefore, &ldquo;controversies of religion must
hinder the advancement of sciences&rdquo; (SEH XI: 137&ndash;8).</p>

<h2 id="BacLeg">9. Bacon&rsquo;s Legacy</h2>

<p>
Bacon&rsquo;s philosophical legacy was large and enduring. Soon after
he published his Latin philosophical works in the early 1620s, they
were widely read and commented on in continental Europe. His first
readers in the Netherlands were Constantijn Huygens (1596&ndash;1687),
who already in 1621 was perusing the <em>Instauratio magna</em>, and
Isaac Beeckman (1588&ndash;1637), who wrote extensive notes on
Bacon&rsquo;s philosophy in the 1620s (Hotson 2020: 73; Rees 2004:
xxiii). The <em>Instauratio magna</em> was taught, for instance, in
Bremen in the late-1620s (Hotson 2020: 165&ndash;6). In France, Pierre
Gassendi (1592&ndash;1655) and Marin Mersenne (1588&ndash;1648) were
particularly keen but critical readers, and Bacon&rsquo;s texts were
also explored by Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596&ndash;1650) and many
others. They acknowledged many of his ideas and even conducted
experiments along the Baconian line but still preferred a more
rationalist approach (P&eacute;rez-Ramos 1996: 312&ndash;14; Buccolini
2014; Jalobeanu 2014). The <em>Instauratio magna</em> traveled quickly
to the Baltic, and the most detailed early criticism of it was written
in the Baltic town of Elbing around 1626&ndash;7 by David Mylius, a
teacher in the local Gymnasium, who defended old-style syllogistic
logic against Bacon. Caspar Streso (1603&ndash;1664), a young German
theologian and a convinced Baconian, quickly rushed to Bacon&rsquo;s
defense (Serjeantson forthcoming).</p>

<p>
In England, one of the earliest and most important Baconians was
Samuel Hartlib (c. 1600&ndash;62), a native of Elbing. He was likely
responsible for Mylius&rsquo;s acquaintance with the <em>Instauratio
magna</em> and certainly behind Streso&rsquo;s familiarity with
Mylius&rsquo;s critique of it (Serjeantson forthcoming). Hartlib,
together with Jan Amos Comenius (1592&ndash;1670) and John Dury
(1596&ndash;1680), promoted Baconian ideas about science and
technology and their utility and benefit during the revolutionary
decades of the 1640s and 1650s (Rees 2004: xxiv; Hotson 2020:
265&ndash;301; Webster 1975). The foundation of the Royal Society in
1660 marked the peak of Bacon&rsquo;s reputation and the
&ldquo;victory of the Baconian project of collaboration, utility, and
progress in natural inquiries&rdquo; (P&eacute;rez-Ramos 1996: 316).
Bacon&rsquo;s theory of induction, along with his natural histories
and experimentalism, significantly inspired the emergence of
experimental philosophy and empiricism in the late seventeenth century
(Anstey &amp; Vanzo 2023). He was also invoked to justify Newton, but
quickly, Newtonian science was employed to vindicate Baconianism (Rees
2004: xxvi). During the Enlightenment, Bacon&rsquo;s fame was equally
great: Voltaire and Rousseau, Condorcet and d&rsquo;Alembert praised
him and his philosophical achievements. They largely overlooked
Bacon&rsquo;s methodological insights and, like those in revolutionary
England in the mid-seventeenth century, regarded the Baconian project
as about science and technology harnessed to societal needs
(P&eacute;rez-Ramos 1996: 320&ndash;1).</p>

<p>
Many British philosophers paid homage to Bacon in the early nineteenth
century while critically examining his methodological injunctions.
Soon, however, his reputation as a philosopher started to wane, and he
was no longer seen as having provided the methodology for subsequent
natural philosophy and science (P&eacute;rez-Ramos 1996: 321&ndash;7;
Rees 2004: xxvii&ndash;xxxi). Such criticism continued in the
twentieth century when many epistemologists emphasized that Bacon was
&ldquo;a champion of what science has never been and will never
be&rdquo; (Rossi 1996, 43). The Frankfurt School took up the
Enlightenment view of Bacon but turned it upside down, castigating him
as responsible for the modern scientific domination of nature and
humankind. More recent scholarship has underlined Bacon&rsquo;s
seminal importance in early modern philosophy. His <em>Instauratio
magna</em>, with its emphasis on operative science, collaboration and
a new method, has been given a central place in historical accounts of
the birth of the new science (Rees 2004: xl&ndash;xlvi).</p>
