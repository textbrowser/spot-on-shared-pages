<h2><a id="Ove">1. Overview</a></h2>

<h3><a id="HisCon">1.1 Historical Considerations</a></h3>

<p>
Developmental biology is the science that investigates how a variety
of interacting processes generate an organism&rsquo;s heterogeneous
shapes, size, and structural features that arise on the trajectory
from embryo to adult, or more generally throughout a life cycle (Love
2008; Minelli 2011a; Weber 2022). It represents a mature area of
contemporary experimental biology that focuses on phenomena that have
puzzled natural philosophers and scientists for more than two
millennia. How do the dynamic relations among seemingly homogeneous
components in the early stages of an embryo produce a unified whole
organism containing heterogeneous parts in the appropriate arrangement
and with correct interconnections? More succinctly, how do we explain
<em>ontogeny</em> (or, more archaically, <em>generation</em>)? In
<em>Generation of Animals</em>, Aristotle provided the first
systematic investigation of developmental phenomena and recognized key
issues about the emergence of and relationships between hierarchically
organized parts (e.g., bone and anatomical features containing bone),
as well as the explanatory difficulty of determining how a
morphological form is achieved reliably in offspring (e.g., the
typical shape and structure of appendages in a particular species).
Generation remained a poignant question throughout the early modern
period (Roe 1981) and was explored by many key figures writing at the
time, including William Harvey, Ren&eacute; Descartes, Robert Boyle,
Pierre Gassendi, Nicolas Malebranche, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Anne
Conway, Immanuel Kant, and others (Smith 2006). Observations of life
cycle transitions, such as metamorphosis, fed into these endeavors and
led to striking conclusions, such as Leibniz&rsquo;s denial of
generation <em>sensu stricto</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Animals and all other organized substances have no beginning &hellip;
their apparent generation is only a development, a kind of
augmentation &hellip; a transformation like any other, for instance
like that of a caterpillar into a butterfly. (Smith 2011:
186&ndash;187)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A major theme that crystallized in this history of investigation is
the distinction between epigenesis and preformation (see the entry on
 <a href="../theories-biological-development/">theories of biological development</a>).
 Proponents of epigenesis claimed that heterogeneous, complex features
of form emerge from homogeneous, less complex embryonic structures
through interactive processes. Thus, an explanation of the ontogeny of
these form features requires accounting for how the interactions occur
and yield integrated outcomes. Proponents of preformation claimed that
complex form preexists in the embryo and &ldquo;unfolds&rdquo; via
ordinary growth processes. An adequate explanation involves detailing
how growth occurs. Although preformation has a lighter explanatory
burden in accounting for how form emerges during ontogeny (on the
assumption that growth is easier to explain than interactions among
processes), it also must address how the starting point of the next
generation is formed with the requisite heterogeneous complex
features. This was sometimes accomplished by embedding smaller and
smaller miniatures <em>ad infinitum</em> inside the organism
 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
 Epigenetic perspectives were often dependent on forms of teleological
reasoning (see the entry on
 <a href="../teleology-biology/">teleological notions in biology</a>)
 to account for why interactions among homogeneous components
eventually result in a complex, integrated whole organism. Though
nothing prevents mixing features of these two outlooks in explaining
different aspects of development, polarization into dichotomous
positions has occurred frequently (Rose 1981; Smith 2006).</p>

</div>

<p>
In the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the
topic of development was salient in controversies surrounding
vitalism, such as the disagreement between Wilhelm Roux and Hans
Driesch over how to explain ontogeny (Maienschein 1991). Roux thought
that a fertilized egg contains inherited elements that represent
different organismal characteristics. During the process of cellular
division, these elements become unequally distributed among daughter
cells leading to distinct cell fates. Driesch, in contrast, held that
each cell retained its full potential through division even though
differentiation occurred. Although this issue is often understood in
terms of the metaphysics of life (vitalism <em>versus</em> materialism
or mechanism), Driesch&rsquo;s interpretation of development and the
autonomy of an organism had epistemological dimensions (Maienschein
2000). The explanatory disagreement involved different experimental
approaches and divergent views on the nature of differentiation in
early ontogeny (e.g., to what degree cells are pre-specified).
Additionally, the landscape of possible perspectives is not best
characterized as a dichotomy since vitalism admitted of many diverse
interpretations (Donohue and Wolfe 2022) and viewpoints that openly
rejected vitalism or physico-chemical mechanism offered alternatives
that emphasized the organizational nature of living systems as crucial
to explaining their development and other properties
(&ldquo;organicism&rdquo;: Esposito 2013; Nicholson and Gawne 2015;
Peterson 2016).</p>

<p>
A familiar philosophical theme running through these discussions, both
epistemological and metaphysical, is the status of
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>.
 Through the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century,
embryology&mdash;the scientific discipline studying
development&mdash;slowly transformed into developmental biology
(Berrill 1961). In conjunction with the issue of reductionism, a key
aspect of this history is the molecularization of experimental (as
opposed to comparative) embryology (Fraser and Harland 2000), with a
concomitant emphasis on the explanatory power of genes (see the entry
on
 <a href="../gene/">gene</a>).
 This complex and fascinating history, including interrelations with
medicine and reproductive technology, has been detailed elsewhere
(see, e.g., Oppenheimer 1967; Horder et al. 1986; Hamburger 1988;
Hopwood 2009, 2019; Maienschein 2014; Maienschein et al. 2005; Gilbert
1991; Embryo Project in Other Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
Developmental biology has increasingly become an area of exploration
for
 <a href="../biology-philosophy/">philosophy of biology</a>
 due to the potential relevance for understanding evolutionary
processes (Love 2024; see the entry on
 <a href="../evolution-development/">evolution and development</a>),
 the theme of reductionism in biology and explanations from molecular
genetics (Kaiser 2015; Robert 2004; Rosenberg 2006), and because
developmental phenomena like stem cells illustrate dispositional
properties (Fagan 2013; Laplane 2016). However, it should not be
forgotten that ontogeny was on the radar of philosophical scholars in
the 20<sup>th</sup> century, as seen in Ernest Nagel&rsquo;s treatment
of hierarchical organization and reduction in the development of
living systems (Nagel 1961: 432ff). For contemporary philosophy of
science, developmental biology displays a rich array of material and
conceptual practices that can be analyzed to better understand the
scientific reasoning exhibited in experimental life science (see the
entry on
 <a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>).
 After a brief review of some central phenomena of ontogeny, this
entry explores five domains that represent some of the import and
promise of conceptual reflection on the epistemology of developmental
biology.</p>

<h3><a id="DevPhe">1.2 Developmental Phenomena</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>
Developmental biology is the science that seeks to explain how the
structure of organisms changes with time. Structure, which may also be
called morphology or anatomy, encompasses the arrangement of parts,
the number of parts, and the different types of parts. (Slack 2006:
6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Most of the properties that developmental biologists attempt to
explain are structural rather than functional. For example, a
developmental biologist typically concentrates more on how tissue
layers fold or how shape is generated than on what the folded tissue
layers do or how the shape functions. The ontogeny of function, at all
levels of organization, is an element of developmental biology, but it
is often bracketed because of the predominance (both past and present)
of questions surrounding the ontogeny of form or structure (Love
2008).</p>

<p>
Textbooks (e.g., Gilbert 2010; Slack 2013; Wolpert et al. 2010)
typically describe a canonical set of events surrounding the changing
structures displayed during animal
 development.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The first of these is <em>fertilization</em> (in sexually reproducing
species), where an already semi-organized egg merges with a sperm
cell, followed by the fusion of their nuclei to achieve the
appropriate complement of genetic material. Second, the fertilized egg
undergoes several rounds of <em>cleavage</em>, which are mitotic
divisions without cell growth that subdivide the zygote into many
distinct cells
 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).
 After many rounds of cleavage, this spherical conglomerate of cells
(now called a <em>blastula</em>) begins to exhibit some specification
of <em>germ layers</em> (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) and then
proceeds to invaginate at one end, a complex process referred to as
<em>gastrulation</em> that eventually yields a through-gut. All three
germ layers, from which specific types of cells are derived (e.g.,
neural cells from ectoderm), become established during gastrulation or
shortly after it
 completes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 <em>Organogenesis</em> refers to the production of tissues and organs
through the interaction and rearrangement of cell groups. Events
confined to distinct taxonomic groups include <em>neurulation</em> in
chordates, whereas other events correlate with mode of development
(<em>metamorphosis</em> from a larval to adult stage) or individual
trauma (<em>regeneration</em> of a limb).</p>

The second column (B) has 8 cells, the bigger lower orange ones labelled '1A', '1B', '1C', and '1D'; the smaller pink ones on top labelled '1a', '1b', '1c', and '1d'. The third column (C) has 12 cells with the bottom, orange, labelled '2A' through '2D', the middle, red, labelled '2a' through '2d' and the top, pink, labelled '1a' through '1d'. The fourth column (D) has 16 cells, bottom layer, orange, is '2A' through '2D', top, pink, is '1a1' through '1d1', the middle alternates between larger red cells labelled '2a' through '2d' and smaller beige cells labelled '1a2' through '1d2'. The fifth column (E) has at the bottom orange cells labelled '3A' through '3D', at the top a cross of four pink cells labelled '1a1' through '1d1' and between the branches of the cross four beige cells labelled '1a2' through '1d2'. In the middle are large red cells labelled '2a' through '2d' and squished between the orange, beige, and red cells are dark red cells labelled '3a' through '3d'. The last column (F) is different. On the top is a clump of cells colored blue, green, pink, and orange. On the bottom on the left side is an arrow pointed up labelled 'developmental time'. Next to it is a 6 rowed drawing. The first row on the bottom extends the full width of the column and contains the word 'zygote', the row above is split in two, on the left 'AB' and on the left 'CD'. The third row is split evenly in 4: green 'A', blue 'B', orange 'C', and red 'D'. The fourth row is split evenly into 8 each shaded the same color as the unit below (though with different intensities). The fifth row is split evenly into 16 and the sixth row into 32 following the same pattern as the fourth row.]" src="Figure2.png" />

</div>

<p>
Several key processes underlie these distinct developmental events and
the resulting features of form that emerge (e.g., the through-gut
formed subsequent to gastrulation or the heart formed during
organogenesis). These are critical to the ontogeny of form and link
directly to major research questions in developmental biology. First,
cellular properties change during ontogeny. This is a function of
<em>differentiation</em> whereby cells adopt specific fates that
include shape changes and other transformations
 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).
 Second, regions of cells in the embryo are designated through
arrangement and composition alterations that correspond to different
axes in different parts of the embryo (e.g., dorsal-ventral,
anterior-posterior, left-right, and proximal-distal). The successive
establishment of these regions is referred to as <em>pattern
formation</em>. Third, cells translocate and aggregate into layers
(e.g., endoderm and ectoderm, followed by the mesoderm in many
lineages) and later tissues (aggregations of differentiated cell
types). Fourth, cells and tissues migrate and interact to produce new
arrangements and shapes composed of multiple tissue layers with novel
functions (i.e., organs). These last two sets of processes are usually
termed <em>morphogenesis</em> (Davies 2023) and occur via many
distinct mechanisms. Fifth, there is <em>growth</em> in the size of
different form features in the individual, remarkably obvious when
comparing zygote to adult, although proportional change between
different features (<em>allometry</em>) is also striking, such as
differential growth in the front claws of fiddler crabs (Figure
4).</p>

<p>
None of these processes occur in isolation and explanations of
particular form features usually draw on several of them
simultaneously, presuming other features that originated earlier in
ontogeny by different instantiations and combinations of the
processes. This sets a broad agenda for investigation: how do various
iterations and combinations of these processes generate form features
during ontogeny? Consider the concrete example of vertebrate
cardiogenesis. How does the vertebrate heart, with its internal and
external shape and structure originate during ontogeny (Harvey 2002)?
How does the heart come to exhibit left/right asymmetry in the body
cavity? What causes cells to adopt a muscle cell fate or certain
tissues to interact in the prospective region of the heart? How do
muscle cells migrate to, aggregate in, and differentiate at the
correct location? How does the interior of the heart adopt a
particular tubular structure with various chambers (that differs among
vertebrate species)? How does the heart grow at a particular rate and
achieve a specific size? Solutions relevant to explaining the ontogeny
of form characterize causal factors that account for how different
processes occur and yield various outcomes.</p>

<h3><a id="DevMech">1.3 Developmental Mechanisms</a></h3>

<p>
A developmental <em>mechanism</em> is a mechanism or process that
operates during ontogeny (see McManus 2012 and &Ouml;zpolat et al.
2025 for discussion). At least two different types of developmental
mechanisms can be distinguished (Love 2017a): molecular genetic
mechanisms (signaling or gene regulatory networks) and
cellular-physical mechanisms (cell migration or epithelial
invagination). Philosophical explorations of mechanisms in science and
mechanistic explanation have grown dramatically over the past two
decades (Craver and Darden 2013; Glennan and Illari 2017; Illari and
Williamson 2012; see the entry on
 <a href="../science-mechanisms/">mechanisms in science</a>).
 Among different accounts of scientific mechanisms, four shared
elements are discernable: (1) what a mechanism is for, (2) its
constituents, (3) its organization, and, (4) the spatiotemporal
context of its operation. Developmental explanations seek to
characterize these four elements through various experimental
interventions. Together these elements provide a template for
characterizing the two different types of developmental
mechanisms.</p>

<p>
A well-established molecular genetic mechanism is the initial
formation of segments in <em>Drosophila</em> due to the segment
polarity network of gene expression (Wolpert et al. 2010, 70&ndash;81; Damen
2007). By Stage 8 of development (~3 hours post-fertilization),
<em>Drosophila</em> embryos have 14 parasegment units that were
defined by pair-rule gene expression in earlier stages. The
transcription factor Engrailed accumulates in the anterior portion of
each parasegment. This initiates a cascade of gene activity that
defines the boundaries of each compartment of cells that will
eventually become a segment. One element of this activity is the
expression of <em>hedgehog</em>, a secreted signaling protein, in
cells anterior to the band of cells where Engrailed has accumulated,
which marks the posterior boundary of each nascent segment. This, in
turn, activates the expression of <em>wingless</em>, another secreted
signaling protein, which maintains the expression of both
<em>engrailed</em> and <em>hedgehog</em> in a feedback loop so that
segment boundaries persist
 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 5</a>).
 The segment polarity network exhibits all four of the shared elements
of a mechanism. It is constituted by a number of parts (e.g.,
Engrailed, Wingless, Hedgehog) and activities or component operations
(e.g., signaling proteins bind receptors, transcription factors bind
to DNA and initiate gene expression), which are organized into
patterns of interacting relationships (feedback loops, signaling
pathways) within a spatiotemporal context (in parasegments of the
<em>Drosophila</em> embryo, ~3 hours post-fertilization) so as to
produce a specific behavior or phenomenon (a set of distinct segments
with well-defined boundaries).</p>

</div>

<p>
Next, consider the cellular-physical mechanism of branching
morphogenesis, which refers to combinations of cellular proliferation
and movement that yield branch-like structures in kidneys, lungs,
glands, or blood vessels. There are many types of branching
morphogenesis, but one primary mechanism is epithelial folding, which
involves cells invaginating at different locations on a structure to
yield branches (Davies 2023, ch. 20). Different cellular-physical
mechanisms can produce invaginations that lead to branching structures
(Varner and Nelson 2014): the constriction of one end of a subset of
columnar cells in an epithelium (&ldquo;apical constriction&rdquo;);
increased cell proliferation of one epithelial sheet in relation to
another (&ldquo;differential growth&rdquo;); and compression of an
epithelium leading to periodic invaginations (&ldquo;mechanical
buckling&rdquo;). That different mechanisms can lead to the same
morphological outcome means it can be difficult to discern which
mechanism is operating in an embryonic context. Branching
morphogenesis also exhibits all four of the shared elements of a
mechanism. The parts are cells and tissues with activities or
component operations (e.g., apical constriction, differential growth,
mechanical buckling) being organized into patterns of interacting
relationships, such as apical constriction leading to epithelial
invagination, within a spatiotemporal context (e.g., in tracheal
precursors within the <em>Drosophila</em> embryo around Stage 7 and
8). This organization produces a specific behavior or phenomenon (a
set of branching structures&mdash;the trachea).</p>

<p>
Once these types of developmental mechanisms have been distinguished,
several conceptual issues become salient. The first pertains to how
the two types of mechanisms are interrelated during ontogeny, and how
different investigative approaches do or do not successfully provide
integrated accounts of them. A second is their distinct patterns of
generality. Molecular genetic mechanisms are widely conserved across
phylogenetically disparate taxa as a consequence of evolutionary
descent, whereas cellular-physical mechanisms are widely instantiated
as a consequence of shared physical organization but not due to
evolutionary descent (Love 2017a). The divergence of these patterns
has prompted explicit epistemological reflection by developmental
 biologists.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2><a id="EpiOrgDevBio">2. The Epistemological Organization of Developmental Biology</a></h2>

<p>
One recurring theme in the long history of investigations into
development is that explaining the ontogeny of form consists of many
interrelated questions about diverse phenomena. Sometimes philosophers
have attempted to compress these questions into one broad problem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The real question concerning metazoan ontogeny is just how a single
cell gives rise to the requisite number of differentiated cell
lineages with all the right inductive developmental interactions
required to reproduce the form of the mature organism (Moss 2002:
97).</p>

<p>
The central problem of developmental biology is to understand how a
relatively simple and homogeneous cellular mass can differentiate into
a relatively complex and heterogeneous organism closely resembling its
progenitor(s) in relevant aspects (Robert 2004: 1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This language is not necessarily incorrect but can lead to skewed
interpretations. For example, Philip Kitcher has argued that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In contemporary developmental biology, there is &hellip; uncertainty
about how to focus the big, vague question, How do organisms develop?
(Kitcher 1993: 115)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is simply false. While it is true that these questions have been
manifested with differing frequency and vigor through history, and the
ability to answer them (as well as the nature of the questions
themselves) has been contingent on different research strategies and
methods, the issue has not been an unwieldy central problem. But
scrutinizing the structure of developmental biology&rsquo;s questions
is not merely an exercise in clarification. It is crucial for
understanding how the science of developmental biology is
organized.</p>

<h3><a id="NoTheDev">2.1 No Theory of Development?</a></h3>

<p>
Although it is common in philosophy to associate sciences with
theories, such that the individuation of a science is dependent on a
constitutive theory or group of models, it is uncommon to find
presentations of developmental biology that make reference to a
<em>theory</em> of development (see discussion in Minelli and Pradeu
2014). Instead, we find references to families of approaches
(developmental genetics, experimental embryology, cell biology, and
 <a href="../molecular-biology/">molecular biology</a>)
 or catalogues of &ldquo;key molecular components&rdquo;
(transcription factor families, inducing factor families, cytoskeleton
or cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components). No
standard theory or group of models provides theoretical scaffolding in
the major textbooks (e.g., Slack 2013; Wolpert et al. 2010; Gilbert
2010). The absence of any reference to a constitutive theory of
development or some consensus set of core explanatory models is
<em>prima facie</em> puzzling. Three interpretations of this situation
are possible: (a) despite the lack of reference to theories, one can
reconstruct a theory (or theories) of developmental biology out of the
relevant discourse (e.g., multiple allied molecular models); (b) the
lack of reference to theories indicates an immaturity in developmental
biology, because mature sciences always have systematic theories; and,
(c) the lack of reference to theories should be taken at face
value.</p>

<p>
Developmental biology is not an immature science, groping about for
some way to explain its phenomena: &ldquo;some of the basic processes
and mechanisms of embryonic development are now quite well
understood&rdquo; (Slack 2013: 7). The impetus for this type of
interpretation arises out of commitments to a conception of mature
science that presumes theories are abstract systems with a small set
of laws or core principles (see the entry on
 <a href="../structure-scientific-theories/">the structure of scientific theories</a>).
 On the other hand, holding that developmental biology already has a
theory costumed in different guise&mdash;not referred to as such by
developmental biologists&mdash;is a possible interpretation. It arises
out of a view that sciences must have theories, which has been
expanded to allow for different understandings of theory structure,
such as constellations of models without laws, even though the
assumption is that theory still plays a broadly similar organizing
role in guiding research. However, this assumption should be
challenged and rejected on methodological grounds in the case of
developmental biology. An analysis of the reasoning in a science
should exhibit epistemic transparency and not postulate
&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; reasoning structure (Love 2012). This criterion
is based on the premise that the basis of successes in scientific
inquiry must be available to those engaged in its practice (i.e.,
scientists). If we postulate hidden structure not present in
scientific discourse to account for inductive inference, explanation,
or other forms of reasoning, then we risk obscuring how scientists
themselves access this structure to evaluate it (Woodward 2003: ch.
4). The successes of developmental biology would become mysterious
when viewed from the vantage point of its participants.</p>

<p>
Epistemic transparency demands a descriptive correspondence between
philosophical accounts of science and scientific practice. This does
not mean that every claim made by any scientist should be taken with
the same credence. A ruling concern is <em>pervasive</em> features of
practice. The problem with assuming laws are required for explanation
is their relative absence from a variety of successful sciences
routinely offering explanations, not that no scientist ever appeals to
laws as explanatory. Pervasive features of scientific practice should
be prominent in philosophical accounts of sciences. Thus, it is not
surprising that the desire for a theory can be found among some
developmental biologists: &ldquo;Developing a theory is of utmost
importance for any discipline&rdquo; (Sommer 2009: 417). But the fact
that these calls are rare means we should not assume theories are
actually needed to govern and organize inquiry within the
 domain.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It was once thought that each science must have laws in order to offer
explanations (see the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-explanation/">scientific explanations</a>),
 but now this is seen as unnecessary (Giere 1999; Woodward 2003). The
expectation that a science must have a theory to accomplish the task
of organizing and guiding inquiry is of similar vintage. It derives
from an intuitive expectation of what counts as a mature science in
the first place. (&ldquo;Even if we find empirically successful and
coherent traditions of research without a systematic theoretical
framework providing guidance, then the science cannot be
mature.&rdquo;) One might shrug off these quasi-positivist appeals to
maturity by invoking more flexible conceptions of theory and theory
structure. But why retain the expectation that theories should
accomplish the same epistemic tasks? This is a preconception about
knowledge structure that is not plausible in light of the diversity of
research practices found across the sciences. The few scientists who
favor this philosophical response have different motivations. Instead
of maturity, other reasons are salient, such as guidance in the face
of a welter of biochemical detail or the need to forge a synthesis
between evolution and
 development.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Developmental biologists recognize that the &ldquo;curse of
detail&rdquo; is one of the costs of developmental biology&rsquo;s
meteoric success over the past three decades: &ldquo;The principal
challenge today is that of exponentially increasing detail&rdquo;
(Slack 2013: ix). While something must provide organization and
guidance to developmental biology, it need not be theories that
accomplish the task. Regarding calls for a synthesis of evolution and
development, these often assume that having a developmental theory is
a precondition for synthesis (Sommer 2009): &ldquo;Our troubles
&hellip; derive from our standing lack of an explicit theory of
development&rdquo; (Minelli 2011a: 4). However, this line of argument
assumes evolutionary theory exhibits the supposed structure to which
developmental biologists should aspire. The actual practice associated
with evolutionary theory indicates a more flexible framework that is
responsively adjusted to the diverse investigative aims of
evolutionary researchers (Love 2013). Therefore, it is not clear that
evolutionary theory supplies the preferred template. A productive way
forward is to relinquish the prior expectation that sciences must have
theories of a certain kind to govern and guide their activity.
Instead, sciences that display empirical success and fecundity should
be studied to discover what features are responsible, without assuming
that those features will be the same for all sciences: &ldquo;Science
need not be understood in these terms and, indeed, may be better
understood in other terms&rdquo; (Giere 1999: 4).</p>

<h3><a id="EroOrg">2.2 Erotetic Organization</a></h3>

<p>
The criterion of epistemic transparency encourages an exploration
of our third interpretive option&mdash;the lack of reference to
theories should be taken at face value. Developmental biology is
organized primarily by stable, broad domains of problems that
correspond to abstract representations of major ontogenetic processes
(differentiation, pattern formation, growth, and morphogenesis). Yet
how do we interpret the &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; aspects of
developmental biology (e.g., positional information models of pattern
formation) and the utilization of theories from other domains (e.g.,
biochemistry)? One way is to distinguish between theory-informed
science&mdash;<em>using</em> theoretical knowledge&mdash;and
theory-directed science&mdash;<em>having</em> a theory that directs
inquiry and organizes knowledge (Waters 2007b); developmental biology
is theory-informed but not theory-directed. Theories need not be
wholly absent from developmental biology but&mdash;when
present&mdash;they play roles very different from standard
philosophical expectations. Developmental biology uses theoretical
knowledge from biochemistry when appealing to morphogen gradients to
explain how segments are established or chemical thermodynamics when
invoking reaction&ndash;diffusion mechanisms to explain pigmentation
patterns. It also uses theoretical knowledge derived from within
developmental biology, such as positional information models.
Different kinds of theory inform developmental biology, but these do
not organize research&mdash;they are not necessary to structure the
knowledge and direct investigative activities. Developmental
biologists are not focused on confirming and extending the theory of
reaction&ndash;diffusion mechanisms, nor are they typically organizing
their research around positional
 information.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 This theoretical knowledge is used in building explanations but does
not provide rails of guidance for how to proceed in a research
program. All sciences may use theoretical knowledge, but this is not
the same as all sciences having a theory providing direction and
organization.</p>

<p>
Why think that problems provide organizational architecture for the
epistemology of developmental biology? They are a pervasive feature of
its reasoning practices, illustrated in textbooks that capture
substantial community consensus about standards of explanation,
experimental methods, essential concepts, and empirical content.
Unlike evolutionary biology textbooks that discuss the theory of
natural selection or economics textbooks that talk about microeconomic
theory, an examination of several editions of major textbooks indicate
that developmental biology does not have similar kinds of
theories.</p>

<p>
Jonathan Slack&rsquo;s <em>Essential Developmental Biology</em> (Slack
2006, 2013) is organized around four main types of processes, also
described as clustered groups of problems, which occur during
embryonic development: regional specification (pattern formation),
cell differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. These broad clusters
are then fleshed out along a standard timeline of early development,
highlighting gametogenesis, fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, and
axis specification. Different experimental approaches (cell and
molecular biology, developmental genetics, and experimental
embryology) are utilized in a specific set of model organisms to
dissect the workings of these developmental phenomena. Subsequent
chapters cover later aspects of development (e.g., organogenesis),
with different systems treated in depth by tissue layer,
differentiation and growth, or in relation to evolutionary questions.
Throughout this presentation, no specific theory, set of hypotheses,
or dominant model is invoked to organize these different domains of
investigation. Instead, broad clusters of questions that reflect
generally delineated processes (differentiation, specification,
morphogenesis, and growth) set the agenda of research.</p>

<p>
Scott Gilbert&rsquo;s <em>Developmental Biology</em> exhibits a
similar pattern (Gilbert 2000 [2003, 2006, 2010]). Developmental
biology is constituted by two broad questions (&ldquo;How does the
fertilized egg give rise to the adult body? And how does that adult
body produce yet another body?&rdquo;), which can then be subdivided
into further categories, such as differentiation, morphogenesis,
growth, reproduction, regeneration, evolution, and environmental
regulation. These questions can be parsed more analytically in terms
of five variables: abstraction, variety, connectivity, temporality,
and spatial composition. The values given to these variables structure
the constellation of research questions within the broad problem
agendas corresponding to generally delineated processes. For example,
research questions oriented around events in zebrafish gastrulation
are structured in a way that differs from the research questions
oriented around vertebrate neural crest cell migration because they
involve different values for the five variables: abstraction
(zebrafish vs. vertebrates), temporality (earlier vs. later), spatial
composition (tissue layer interactions vs. a distinctive population of
cells), variety (epiboly vs. epithelial to mesenchymal transition),
and connectivity (gut formation and endoderm vs. organogenesis and
ectoderm/mesoderm). These configurations can be adjusted readily in
response to shifts in the values for different variables (Love
 2014).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This anatomy of problems, with explicit epistemological structure
derived from different values for these variables, operates to
organize the science of development. Investigators from different
disciplines can be working on the same problem but asking different
questions that require distinct but complementary methodological
resources. Knowledge and inquiry in developmental biology are
intricately organized, just not by a central theory or group of
models, and this erotetic organization is epistemologically accessible
to the participating scientists. While theoretical knowledge,
especially that drawn from molecular biological mechanisms (see the
entry on
 <a href="../molecular-biology/">molecular biology</a>)
 and mathematical models (e.g., reaction&ndash;diffusion models) is
ubiquitous (<em>theory-informed</em>), the clusters of problems that
reappear across the textbooks and correspond to different types of
processes provide the governing architecture (<em>not
theory-directed</em>), which can be characterized explicitly according
to the variables described.</p>

<h2><a id="ExpAppDev">3. Explanatory Approaches to Development</a></h2>

<p>
Explanations in developmental biology are usually causal and described
as &ldquo;mechanistic.&rdquo; However, unlike standard conceptions of
mechanistic explanation, there is a constant acquisition of new causal
capacities (in terms of constituent entities, activities, and their
organization) through development (McManus 2012; Parkkinen 2014).
Although much work remains in characterizing different aspects of
explanation in developmental biology, there is no doubt that a
difference making or manipulability conception of causation (see the
entry on
 <a href="../causation-mani/">causation and manipulability</a>)
 provides a core element of the reasoning (Woodward 2003; Strevens
2009; Waters 2007a). Genetic explanations of development, similar to
what is seen in
 <a href="../molecular-genetics/">molecular genetics</a>,
 work by identifying changes in the expression of genes and
interactions among their RNA and protein products that lead to changes
in the properties of morphological features during ontogeny (e.g.,
shape or size), while holding a variety of contextual variables fixed.
More recently, there has been growing interest in physical
explanations of development that involve appeals to mechanical
forces due to geometrical arrangements of mesoscale materials, such as
fluid flow (Forgacs and Newman 2005). Researchers agree on the
phenomena that need to be explained, but differ on whether physical or
genetic factors are more or less explanatory (Keller
 2002).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 The existence of two different types of causal explanations for
developmental phenomena poses an additional question about how they
might be combined into a more integrated explanatory framework.</p>

<h3><a id="Gen">3.1 Genetics</a></h3>

<p>
Many philosophers have turned to explanations of development over the
past two decades in an effort to esteem or deflate claims about the
causal power of genes (Keller 2002; Neumann-Held and Rehmann-Sutter
2006; Rosenberg 2006; Robert 2004; Waters
 2007a).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Genetic explanations touch the philosophical theme of reductionism
and appear to constitute the bulk of empirical success accruing to
developmental biology over the past several
 decades.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Statements from developmental biologists reinforce this
perspective:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Developmental biology &hellip; deals with the process by which the
genes in the fertilized egg control cell behavior in the embryo and so
determine its pattern, its form, and much of its behavior &hellip;
differential gene activity controls development. (Wolpert et al. 1998:
v, 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These types of statements are sometimes amplified in appeals to a
genetic <em>program</em> for development.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Elements of the genome] contain the sequence-specific code for
development; and they determine the particular outcome of
developmental processes, and thus the form of the animal produced by
every embryo. &hellip; Development is the execution of the genetic
program for construction of a given species of organism (Davidson
2006: 2,
 16).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
At other times, statements concentrate on genetics as the primary
locus of causation in ontogeny: &ldquo;Developmental complexity is the
direct output of the spatially specific expression of particular gene
sets and it is at this level that we can address causality in
development&rdquo; (Davidson and Peter 2015: 2). Whether or not these
statements can be substantiated has been the subject of intense
 debate.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 The strongest claims about genetic programs or the genetic control of
development have empirical and conceptual drawbacks that include an
inattention to plasticity and the role of the environment (see below,
Section 6), an ambiguity about the locus of causal agency, and a
reliance on metaphors drawn from computer science (Gilbert and Epel
2009; Keller 2002; Moss 2002; Robert 2004). However, this leaves
intact the difference-making principle of genetic explanation
exhibited in molecular genetics (Waters 2007a), which yields more
narrow and precise causal claims under controlled experimental
conditions, and is applicable to diverse molecular entities that play
causal roles during development, such as regulatory RNAs, proteins,
and environmental signals. We can observe this briefly by
reconsidering the example of vertebrate cardiogenesis.</p>

<p>
Are there problems with claiming that genes contain all of the
information (see the entry on
 <a href="../information-biological/">biological information</a>)
 to form vertebrate hearts? Is there a genetic program in the DNA
controlling heart development? Are genes the primary supplier and
organizer of material resources for heart development, largely
determining the phenotypic outcome? Existing studies of heart
development have identified a role for fluid forces in specifying the
internal form of the heart (Bassen et al. 2021; Hove et al. 2003) and
its left/right asymmetry (Djenoune et al. 2023; Nonaka et al. 2002).
Biochemical gradients of extracellular calcium are responsible for
activating the asymmetric expression of the regulatory gene
<em>Nodal</em> (Raya et al. 2004) and inhibition of voltage gradients
scrambles normal asymmetry establishment (Levin et al. 2002).
Mechanical cues such as microenvironmental stiffness are crucial for
key transitions from migratory cells into organized sheets during
heart formation (Jackson et al. 2017). A number of genes are clearly
difference makers in these processes (Asp et al. 2019; Srivastava
2006; Brand 2003; Olson 2006), but the conclusion that genes alone
carry all the information needed to generate form features of the
heart seems unwarranted. Although it may be warranted empirically in
some cases to privilege DNA sequence differences as causal factors in
specific processes of ontogeny (Waters 2007a), such as hierarchically
organized networks of genetic difference makers explaining tissue
specification (Peter and Davidson 2011), the diversity of entities
appealed to in molecular genetics and the extent of their individual
and joint roles in specifying developmental outcomes implies that
debates about the meaning, scope, and power of genetic explanations
will continue (Griffiths and Stotz 2013). However, a shift away from
genetic programs and genetic determinism to DNA, RNA, and proteins as
difference makers that operate conjointly suggests that we
conceptualize other causal factors in a similar way.</p>

<h3><a id="Phy">3.2 Physics</a></h3>

<p>
Fluid flow, as a physical force, is also a difference maker during the
development of the heart, and ontogeny more generally, and
developmental biologists appeal to physical difference makers, which
are understood as factors relevant to producing the morphological
properties of developmental phenomena (Bassen et al. 2021; Forgacs and
Newman 2005). A physical causation approach was on display in the late
19th century work of Wilhelm His (Hopwood 1999, 2000; Pearson 2018)
and especially visible in the early 20th century work of D&rsquo;Arcy
Thompson and others (Thompson 1992 [1942]; Briscoe and Kicheva 2017;
Keller 2002: ch. 2; Olby 1986). This occurred in the milieu of the
chromosomal theory of inheritance and attempts to explore
developmental phenomena via classical genetic methods (Morgan 1923,
1926, 1934). Thompson appealed to differential rates of growth
(allometry) and the constraints of geometrical relationships to
explain how organismal morphology originates. Visual representations
of abiotic, mechanical analogues provided plausibility, such as the
shape of liquid splashes or hanging drops for the cup and bell
configurations of the free-swimming sexual stage of jellyfish. If
physical forces generated specific morphologies in viscoelastic
materials, then analogous morphologies in living species should be
explained in terms of physical forces operating on the viscoelastic
materials of the developing embryo. Yet morphogenetic processes that
produce the shape and structure of morphology have been seen
primarily, if not exclusively, in terms of genetics for the last
several decades. Physical approaches moved into the background as
molecular genetics approaches went from strength to strength (Fraser
and Harland 2000).</p>

<p>
The molecularization of experimental embryology is one of the most
striking success stories of contemporary biology as genes and genetic
interactions (e.g., in transcriptional networks and signaling
pathways) were discovered to underlie specific details of
differentiation, morphogenesis, pattern formation, and growth when
structure originates during development (Weber 2024). Genetic
approaches predominate in contemporary developmental biology and
physical modes of causation are frequently neglected. The frustration
among researchers interested in physical causation during
embryogenesis has been palpable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To the molecular types, a cause is a molecule or a gene. To explain a
phenomenon is to identify genes and characterize proteins without
which the phenomenon will fail or be abnormal. A molecule is an
explanation: a force is a description; to argue otherwise brings pity,
at best (Albert Harris to John Trinkaus, 12 March 1996; Source: Marine
Biological Laboratory Library Archives).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite this predominance of genetic explanatory approaches and the
(sometimes) frustration among researchers utilizing other approaches,
a groundswell of interest has been building around physical
explanations of development, especially in terms of their integration
with genetic explanations (Kasirer and Sprinzak 2024; Miller and
Davidson 2013; Newman 2015; Piszker and Simunovic 2024). Some
philosophers and scientists have argued that the biomechanical
modeling of physical causal factors constitutes a rejection of certain
forms of reductive explanation in biology (Green and Batterman 2017;
Palmquist et al. 2025).</p>

<h3><a id="IntAppGenPhy">3.3 Integrating Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
Thompson held that physical forces were explanatory but inadequate in
isolation to account for the developmental origin of morphology;
heredity (genetics) was also a necessary causal
 factor.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 Yet Thompson was quick to highlight that mechanical modes of
causation might be neglected in the midst of growing attention to
heredity (genetics):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is no less of an exaggeration if we tend to neglect these direct
physical and mechanical modes of causation altogether, and to see in
the characters of a bone merely the results of variation and of
heredity. (Thompson 1992 [1942]: 1023)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite this latter form of exaggeration manifesting itself through
much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, an agenda to combine or integrate
the two approaches is now
 explicit.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
There is no controversy about whether genetic and physical modes of
causation are at work simultaneously:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
both the physics and biochemical signaling pathways of the embryo
contribute to the form of the organism. (Von Dassow et al. 2010:
1)</p>

They are not competing causal explanations of the same phenomenon.
Explanations should capture how their productive interactions yield
developmental outcomes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
an increasing number of examples point to the existence of a
reciprocal interplay between expression of some developmental genes
and the mechanical forces that are associated with morphogenetic
movements. (Brouz&eacute;s and Farge 2004: 372)</p>

<p>
mechanical processes can be actively involved in a synergistic
interplay with biochemical processes in a dynamic self-organized
manner that involves extensive feedback operating across scales.
(Maroudas-Sacks and Keren 2021: 470-1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Genetic causes can lead to physical causation and <em>vice versa</em>.
Physical causation brings about genetic causation through
mechanotransduction. Stretching, contraction, compression, fluid shear
stress, and other physical dynamics are sensed by different molecular
components inside and outside of cells that translate these
environmental changes into biochemical signals (Hannezo and Heisenberg
2019; Hoffman et al. 2011; Wozniak and Chen 2009). Genetic causation
brings about physical causation by creating different physical
properties of cells and tissues through the presence, absence, or
change in frequency of particular proteins. For example, different
patterns of expression for cell adhesion molecules (e.g., cadherins)
can lead to differential adhesion across epithelial sheets of tissue
and thereby generate phase separations or compartments via surface
tension variation (Newman and Bhat 2008). If these modes of causation
are not competing, then how might one combine genetic and physical
difference makers into an integrated causal explanation? How much
explanatory unity can be achieved for this &ldquo;reciprocal
interplay&rdquo;?</p>

<p>
Finding philosophical models for the explanatory integration of
genetics and physics remains an open question (Love 2017b).
Apportioning causal responsibility in the sense of determining
relative contributions (e.g., the composition of causal magnitudes
among different physical forces in Newtonian mechanics) is problematic
because this requires commensurability with respect to how causes
produce their effects (Sober 1988). In the context of causation
understood in terms of difference makers, the difficulty of
integration is a variation on a problem in causal reasoning identified
by John Stuart Mill and labeled the &ldquo;intermixture of
effects,&rdquo; which involves multiple causes contributing in a
blended fashion to yield an outcome.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This difficulty is most of all conspicuous in the case of
physiological phenomena; it being seldom possible to separate the
different agencies which collectively compose an organized body,
without destroying the very phenomena which it is our object to
investigate. (Mill 1843 [1974]: 456 [book 3, chapter 11, section 1,
paragraph 7])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Careful statistical methodology in experiments can answer whether one
type of difference maker accounts for more of the variation in the
effect variable for a particular population. But ranking causal
factors with respect to how much of a difference they made is not the
same as combining two modes of causation into an integrated account.
Another response is to dissolve the integration problem by reducing
all causal interactions to one of the two distinct modes, thereby
achieving a kind of explanatory unity (Rosenberg 2006). However, this
approach is eschewed by working biologists who take both genetic and
physical modes of causation as significant and not reducible one to
the other.</p>

<p>
A different strategy is integrative pluralism (Mitchell 2002). This
involves a two-step procedure for explaining complex phenomena whose
features are the result of multiple causes: (a) formulate idealized
models where particular causal factors operate in isolation
(&ldquo;theoretical modeling&rdquo;); and, (b) integrate idealized
models to explain how particular, concrete phenomena originate from
these causes in combination. This model is suggestive but also has
drawbacks that include the fact that genetic causal reasoning in
developmental biology does not typically involve theoretical modeling
and the precise nature of the integration is underspecified.
Integration of genetic and physical difference makers in a single
mechanism offers a further possibility (Darden 2006; Craver 2007).
Although this valuably highlights the productive continuity between
difference makers through stages in a sequence (i.e., their reciprocal
interplay), it also has handicaps. These include:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Divergent approaches to measuring time. Instead of time &ldquo;in the
mechanism,&rdquo; time is measured with external standardized stages.
Stages facilitate the study of different kinds of developmental
mechanisms, with different characteristic rates and durations for
their stages, within a common framework for a model organism (e.g.,
<em>Drosophila</em>), while also permitting conserved molecular
mechanisms to be studied in different species because the
corresponding mechanism description is not anchored to the temporal
sequence of the model organism.</p></li>

<li><p>An expectation that mechanism descriptions &ldquo;bottom-out&rdquo; in
lowest level activities of molecular entities (Darden 2006). In the
case of combining genetic and physical difference makers, the
reciprocal interplay means that there is a studious avoidance of
bottoming out in one or the other mode of causation.</p></li>

<li><p>The requirement of stable, compositional organization for
mechanisms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mechanistic explanations are constitutive or componential
explanations: they explain the behavior of the mechanism as a whole in
terms of the organized activities and interaction of its components.
(Craver 2007: 128)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But these mechanism descriptions are often embedded in different
developmental contexts (at different times in ontogeny) with distinct
compositional relations (within and between species). The reciprocal
interplay between genetic and physical difference makers is not
maintained precisely because these compositional differences alter
relationships of physical causation (fluid flow, tension, etc.).
Developmental biologists have been able to generalize relationships of
genetic causation (in terms of genetic mechanisms) across species
quite widely, but the attempt to combine these with physical causation
has necessitated narrowing the scope of the causal claims.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Adequate philosophical models of the systematic dependence between
genetic and physical difference makers in ontogeny need to account for
how the temporal relations necessary for making causal claims are
anchored in an external periodization used by developmental
biologists. The imposition of different temporal scales can lead to
distinct factors being significant or salient, which matters for
ascertaining how different kinds of causes can be combined into
integrated explanations. One possibility is to juxtapose these
difference makers at distinct stages via experimental verification
such that they exhibit productive continuity within the constraints of
the external periodization (Love 2017b). This facilitates representing
symmetry between causal factors because genetic difference makers can
be placed before or after physical difference makers (and <em>vice
versa</em>). Although this does not provide a way to combine causal
magnitudes (as in vector addition from Newtonian mechanics), it offers
an explicit strategy for assigning responsibility among different
kinds of causes through the vehicle of temporal organization that goes
beyond ranking difference makers. The periodization serves as a
template from the practices of developmental biologists for providing
wholeness or unity to the different modes of causation to yield a kind
of integrated explanation of the morphology that results from a
sequence of developmental processes.</p>

<p>
Not all types of causal explanation involve an external periodization
and there are other ways to combine causes in order to produce more
integrated explanatory frameworks. One area where combined
explanations for developmental phenomena are being analyzed pertains
to mechanism descriptions and mathematical modeling in systems biology
(Brigandt 2013; Fagan 2013). For example, Fagan (2013: ch. 9) shows
how an integrated explanation emerges from a step-wise procedure that
starts with a detailed description of a molecular mechanism followed
by the formulation of an abstracted wiring diagram of component
interactions, which is then translated into a system of equations that
can account for changes in component interactions over time. Solutions
to these systems of equations and a mapping of solutions for the
interactions among components of the system onto the behavior of the
overall system within a shared landscape representation more
systematically explains cellular differentiation.</p>

<h2><a id="ModOrgForStuDev">4. Model Organisms for the Study of Development</a></h2>

<p>
Model organisms are central to contemporary biology and studies of
embryogenesis (Ankeny and Leonelli 2011, 2020; Steel 2008; Bier and
McGinnis 2003; Davis 2004; Larra&iacute;n 2024). Biologists utilize
only a small number of species to experimentally elucidate various
properties of ontogeny (e.g., <em>C. elegans</em>,
<em>Drosophila</em>, and <em>Brachydanio</em> [zebrafish]; see
 <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). These experimental models permit researchers to
investigate development in great depth and facilitate a precise
dissection of causal relationships. Critics have questioned whether
these models are good representatives of other species because of
inherent biases involved in their selection, such as rapid development
and short generation time (Bolker 1995), and problematic presumptions
about the conservation of gene functions and regulatory networks
(Lynch 2009). For example, <em>C. elegans</em> embryogenesis is not
representative of nematodes in terms of pattern formation and cell
specification (Schulze and Schierenberg 2011) and zebrafish appendage
formation is a poor proxy for the development of appendages in
tetrapods (Metscher and Ahlberg 1999).</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig6">
<img alt="[a color photo showing from the side a 0.1 x 0.03 inch (2.5 x 0.8 mm) small male Drosophila melanogaster fly with red eyes facing left.]" src="Figure6.jpg" style="width:200px" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 6:</span> <em>Drosophila
melanogaster</em> (the common fruit fly) is one of the standard model
organisms used in developmental biology.</p>
</div>

<p>
One response to this criticism is to emphasize the conserved genetic
mechanisms shared by all animals despite differences in developmental
phenomena (Gerhart and Kirschner 2007; Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Weber
2005). Fruit flies may be unrepresentative in exhibiting syncytial
development, but they use the collinear expression of <em>Hox</em>
genes to specify their anterior-posterior body axis. This response
indicates that whether an entire model organism is representative
<em>per se</em> is too coarse-grained a criterion to capture the
rationale behind their use. We have to ask about representation
<em>with respect to what</em>, and some accounts have moved in this
direction. For example, Jessica Bolker has distinguished exemplary and
surrogate modes of representation (Bolker 2009), where the former
serve basic research by exemplifying a larger group and the latter
correspond to models designed to provide indirect experimental access
to otherwise inaccessible phenomena, such as mouse models of human
psychological disorders (e.g., depression). Surrogate models are
adopted in biomedical contexts where the phenomena of interest are
manifested in humans. Most developmental biologists consider model
organisms as exemplars, not
 surrogates.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Thus, in order to respond to a criticism of non-representativeness,
the criterion of representation must be explored in more
 detail.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A basic presumption about model organisms is that they bear
appropriate similarity relationships to larger groups of animals. This
presumption is an instantiation of what is discussed generally for
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>
 meant to represent phenomena. Model organisms represent developmental
phenomena in species that are either studied little or never studied
at all: &ldquo;we study flies and frogs as examples for the
development of animals in general&rdquo; (N&uuml;sslein-Volhard 2006:
87). One source of confidence in treating them as exemplars derives
from an inductive inference over discovered patterns of evolutionary
conservation with respect to developmental phenomena (e.g.,
gastrulation or somite formation). If all or most model organisms
share a developmental feature, then all or most animals will share the
feature. This inference can be circumscribed more or less narrowly
(e.g., if all or most vertebrate model organisms share somite
formation, then all or most vertebrates will share it).</p>

<p>
As a consequence of this confidence, the model organism
(&ldquo;source&rdquo;) can represent these other unstudied species
(&ldquo;targets&rdquo;). This basic distinction between the model or
source and the phenomena or target it is supposed to represent is
ubiquitous in reasoning with model organisms (Ankeny and Leonelli
2011, 2020). Zebrafish is a model or representation of vertebrate
development, the target phenomena, because we expect to learn about
vertebrate development generally by studying ontogeny in zebrafish
specifically. We do not invest time and resources into zebrafish as a
model organism only because we are interested in zebrafish.
Researchers plan to make claims about somite formation from
observations in zebrafish that will apply to somite formation in other
vertebrates that we will never have the time or money to
investigate.</p>

<p>
Developmental biologists often speak of investigating mechanisms that
account for phenomena in ontogeny, and focus on conserved genetic and
cellular mechanisms in model organisms (Gerhart and Kirschner 2007;
Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Weber 2005). This suggests a distinction
between representation with respect to developmental phenomena and
representation with respect to genetic and cellular mechanisms
operating in development. If we are interested in explaining how
hearts (<em>phenomena</em>) develop, then we might investigate the
molecular or cellular <em>mechanisms</em> occurring in the heart field
during zebrafish ontogeny. Some of these mechanisms could be conserved
even though the phenomena are not. <em>Drosophila</em> has only one
cardiac cell type, no neural crest cells, and a heart with no atrial
or ventricular chamber morphology (Kirby 1999). However, cardiogenesis
in all invertebrates and vertebrates investigated thus far depends
essentially on the expression of the homeobox gene
<em>Nkx2-5</em>/<em>tinman</em> (Gajewski and Schulz 2002), as well as
many others (Poelmann and Gittenberger-de Groot 2019). The reverse
situation also can hold: similar phenomena may be manifested but
genetic and cellular mechanisms might differ. Amphibians form a neural
tube (neurulation) through a process of invagination (the folding of
an epithelial sheet), whereas teleost fishes form a neural tube via
cavitation (the hollowing out of a block of tissue via cell death).
The neural tube is homologous across vertebrates (i.e., a conserved
phenomenon), but the cellular and genetic mechanisms involved in
invagination versus cavitation are distinct (Davies 2023: ch. 4).</p>

<p>
The distinction between phenomena and mechanisms assumes specificity;
i.e., there are specific phenomena (somite formation in vertebrates)
or mechanisms (collinear <em>Hox</em> gene expression) in view when
judging the relationship between source (model) and target. But animal
development consists of a multitude of different processes that
involve a host of different mechanisms. Therefore, another distinction
operating in the representational criterion pertains to questions of
<em>specificity</em> versus <em>variety</em> when selecting and using
model organisms. A model might represent one type of target phenomena
(differentiation or growth) or mechanism (cell signaling or cell
cycling) but not others&mdash;specificity&mdash;or may do so better or
worse with respect to particular types of phenomena or mechanisms. A
model might represent several types of target phenomena and mechanisms
simultaneously&mdash;variety&mdash;with variability in how each type
is represented. Trade-offs exist with respect to how well different
phenomena or mechanisms are co-instantiated in a model organism. Note
that experimental organisms may be selected with respect to variety
and specificity simultaneously, such as when a biologist working on a
specific phenomenon intends to work on others using the same model in
the future. They also may be selected with one or the other of these
two aspects predominant. A model might be desirable if it has
representational variety in both mechanisms and phenomena even if it
is not the best representative for every specific mechanism or
phenomenon. Conversely, a model organism might be desirable if it is
the best representative for a specific mechanism despite being a very
poor model for other phenomena or mechanisms. Variety is indicative of
the &ldquo;whole organism&rdquo; being the
 model.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 A further distinction can be introduced between &ldquo;model
organisms&rdquo; and &ldquo;experimental organisms&rdquo; (Ankeny and
Leonelli 2011) or &ldquo;general model organisms&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Krogh-principle model organisms&rdquo; (Love 2010). General
model organisms are selected and used with the variety aspect of the
representational criterion preeminent; experimental or Krogh-principle
model organisms are selected and used with specificity preeminent.
When evolution and development are jointly in view, additional
features are pertinent for the selection and use of model organisms
(Love and Yoshida 2019).</p>

<p>
Besides model <em>organisms</em>, increasing attention has been paid
to the potential of advanced <em>in vitro</em> models, such as
organoids. Organoids are three-dimensional cell culture systems that
recapitulate the morphology and physiology of specific types of
organs. An important advantage of organoids is that they can be
generated ethically from human cells. Thus, organoid technology is
expected to provide more plausible models than are available from some
animals in the context of human developmental biology and biomedical
research. Other issues relevant to the representation criterion
include how individual cells or cell types serve as developmental
models (Fagan 2016), how developmental mechanisms in different model
organisms are compared and evaluated (Yoshida 2023), how
generalizations about developmental processes are made and what
properties those generalizations exhibit (Yoshida 2025; Yoshida and
Love 2025), how the use of model organisms constitutes an example of
case-based reasoning (Ankeny 2012; Krause 2021), and how model
organisms involve idealizations or known departures from features
present in the model&rsquo;s target as the result of laboratory
cultivation (Ankeny 2009). Additionally, the question of
representation is not the only one germane to understanding model
organism use. Because model organisms are utilized for experimental
intervention, questions of representation must be juxtaposed with
questions of manipulation (see the supplement on
 <a href="supplement.html">Model Organisms and Manipulation</a>).</p>
 
<h2 id="StemCellTherPote">5. Stem Cells: Potentiality and Therapy</h2>

<p>
Stem cells are cells capable of self-renewing and giving rise to more
differentiated cells (Fagan 2013). Research on stem cells has been an
important source of knowledge, concepts, and technologies for
investigating biological development. This section discusses two
philosophical issues concerning stem cell biology: (a) the concept of
potentiality, as exemplified by stem cells, and (b) the status of
therapeutic goals in the characterization of stem cell biology,
especially its relationship with developmental biology.</p>

<h3 id="TherGoalStemCellBiol">5.1 Dispositions and Potentiality</h3>

<p>
A fertilized egg or zygote has the potential to develop into an adult
organism. Preformation and epigenesis can be seen as attempts to
account for this potential, either as preformed structure that needs
to grow or as homogeneous materials that become heterogeneous and
specific structures through complex interactions. However, the concept
of potentiality harbors its own distinctive philosophical issues. For
example, potential is not directly observable or measurable; it must
be inferred from other empirical information. How confident can we be
of these inferences? Further, when potential becomes observable, it is
no longer potential but actual. Finally, potentiality can itself
develop, with the embryo having more potential at a later time
compared to an earlier time.</p>

<p>
A common approach to potentiality is through the idea of a disposition
or dispositional property: a capacity, ability, or potential to
exhibit some outcome. One can possess an ability without currently
displaying it, such as a skilled guitarist shopping for food in a
grocery store. Thus, it makes sense to attribute dispositions when we
can distinguish between an object having a property and manifesting
that property. For example, the fragility of a window is its
disposition to break under certain conditions (e.g., upon impact from
a rock). The window is fragile even if it never shatters, and we can
assess its degree and kind of fragility despite its lack of
manifestation. This contrasts with non-dispositional
(&ldquo;categorical&rdquo;) properties of the window, such as size or
shape, where a distinction between the property and its manifestation
is irrelevant (see the entry on
 <a href="../dispositions/">dispositions</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Dispositional properties are common across biology (H&uuml;ttemann and
Kaiser 2018), such as the general capacity of an organism to survive
and reproduce as distinct from actual reproductive success. However,
stem cells exhibit one of the most common and prominent dispositional
properties that falls under the broad problem domain of
differentiation: stemness. &ldquo;Stem&rdquo; refers to the central or
main trunk of a tree or shrub, from which other branches emerge.
Accordingly, a stem cell is a generic, unspecialized cell that has the
capacity to &ldquo;branch out&rdquo; and turn into different
specialized cells through the process of differentiation, as well as
generate more generic, unspecialized cells like itself (i.e., a
maintenance of potentiality). This can be visualized in Figure 3,
which represents what a hematopoietic (blood) stem cell can
differentiate into&mdash;notice the self-renewal arrow at the
top. </p>

<p>
Importantly, this differentiation occurs in a sequential pattern and
once a particular pathway of differentiation is followed, the
potentiality of the progenitor cell is lessened or becomes narrower. A
differentiated neutrophil has less potential than a common myeloid
progenitor. A hematopoietic stem cell is multipotent, able to adopt
many but not all cell fates; stem cells in the early embryo, in
contrast, are pluripotent in the sense that they can adopt any fate of
cells that constitute an adult organism.  </p>

<p>
How do developmental biologists know that a hematopoietic stem cell
has all this potential? Intuitively, we might say because
they&rsquo;ve seen hematopoietic stem cells actualize all these
different possibilities, developing into these various types of cells.
But they didn&rsquo;t see the same (token) stem cell develop into all
these outcomes; rather, they tracked many different hematopoietic stem
cells going through rounds of division and traversing different
pathways of differentiation, including self-renewal. Hence, the claim
about the potentiality of an individual hematopoietic stem cell relies
on assumptions about how similar different hematopoietic stem cells
are to one another (corresponding to a type), even though one cannot
measure any individual cell for all of its potential. And once you
make even some of the stem cell potential actual, you no longer have
the same stem cell; it was changed in the process of measuring its
potential. Developmental biologists recognize the conundrum.
&ldquo;The main attributes of stem cells relate to their potential in
the future. These can only effectively be studied by placing the cell,
or cells, in a situation where they have the opportunity to express
their potential. Here, we find ourselves in a circular situation; in
order to answer the question whether a cell is a stem cell we have to
alter its circumstances and in doing so inevitably lose the original
cell and in addition we may only see a limited spectrum of
responses&rdquo; (Potten and Loeffler 1990, 1009). Philosophers
have weighed in on the situation succinctly: &ldquo;There is,
inevitably, an evidential gap between the capacities of a cell
un-manipulated by experiment and realization of capacities in
specific, highly artificial contexts &hellip; claims that any single
cell is a stem cell are inevitably uncertain&rdquo; (Fagan 2013,
65).</p>

<p>
Prior discussions of dispositions within the philosophical literature
provide a number of helpful distinctions to help us understand the
situation of stem cells (see the entry on
 <a href="../dispositions/">dispositions</a>).
 Let&rsquo;s start with stem cell uncertainty. We are uncertain about
a token stem cell (this particular cell), but the claim about the
potentiality of hematopoietic stem cells is intended to refer to a
general type (these <em>kinds</em> of cells). Claims about types are
consistent with variability among tokens; this particular
hematopoietic stem cell in my culture dish may not have had the
potential to be an eosinophil, but most hematopoietic stem cells do
(based on past experimental evidence) and therefore we can ascribe the
disposition to the type.</p>

<p>
Another helpful distinction concerns the causal basis of the
disposition. What gives a stem cell its &ldquo;stemness&rdquo;? One
possibility is that the causal basis is intrinsic, due to cellular
components and their interactions. A different possibility is that the
causal basis is in part extrinsic, due to environmental features. To
see what&rsquo;s going on, we need to carefully distinguish causal
bases from stimulus conditions. If we stir salt into water, the
disposition of solubility we attribute to the salt can have its causal
basis intrinsically in its molecular structure even though being
placed in a water environment is a necessary, stimulus condition for
the disposition to manifest. However, in the case of stem cells,
philosophers have noted that the microenvironment or stem cell niche
seemingly constitutes at least part of the basis for its capacity for
self-renewal (Laplane 2016; Suarez 2023). A weak version of this
&ldquo;niche hypothesis&rdquo; interprets the environmental
contribution simply as stimulus conditions. A stronger version
interprets the environmental contribution as constituting an extrinsic
element of the causal base. In this latter instance, the cell has its
stemness in virtue of a relationship between itself and the
niche&mdash;that is, as a relational property. Which of these is the
case remains a subject of debate.  </p>

<p>
There are other helpful distinctions that can be applied in the
context of stem cells, such as the difference between a single track
and a multi-track disposition. Hematopoietic stem cells have a
multi-track disposition because the same capacity can yield a diverse
number of outcomes (Vetter 2013). We can also distinguish background
conditions from stimulus conditions, where the former are relevant to
a disposition&rsquo;s manifestation but distinct from stimulus
conditions that initiate a particular manifestation. For example, the
rate of differentiation differs depending on the temperature (Harding
et al. 2016). Finally, a disposition can be deterministic&mdash;always
manifesting under a stimulus condition&mdash;or probabilistic,
manifesting under a stimulus condition with some quantitative
frequency. Thinking probabilistically about dispositions is especially
important because in some cases differentiation might occur in a
population of cells independent of specific stimulus conditions
(Maamar et al. 2007). Additionally, there are allied concepts like
&ldquo;dedifferentiation&rdquo; that raise issues about the
reversibility of stem cell manifestations of potentiality and have
implications for biomedicine (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006; Takahashi
et al., 2007; Cai et al. 2007). In summary, the complexity of
potentiality in development, as seen through stem cells and
dispositions, contains a host of interesting open debates and
philosophical questions.</p>

<h3 id="DispPote">5.2 Therapeutic Goals in Stem Cell Biology</h3>

<p>
Research on stem cells has contributed to developmental biology in
many ways for decades. Identification of adult stem cells in specific
tissues and establishment of the concept of stem cell niche have
promoted understanding of tissue development and maintenance; cell
culture techniques have provided powerful <em>in vitro</em> model
systems for studying aspects of development at the cellular level, as
well as a crucial basis for transgenic technologies; and attempts to
&ldquo;rejuvenate&rdquo; mature cells have led to important insights
into the nature of cell differentiation (Lendahl 2022). Conceptual and
technological contributions of stem cell research to the progress of
developmental biology is undeniable.</p>

<p>
If so, what is the status of stem cell biology as an area of research,
especially in terms of its relationship with developmental biology?
Gilbert (2017) claims that although stem cell biology has its own
journals and societies, it still does not qualify as an independent
field. He considers stem cell biology as &ldquo;a political, rather
than an intellectual, bud from developmental biology,&rdquo; which
performs important services, such as providing opportunities for
science education and constructing political guidelines (Gilbert 2017,
5). According to Gilbert, stem cell biology is still merely &ldquo;a
medical aspect of developmental biology&rdquo; that lacks distinct
disciplinary identity (Gilbert 2017, 5). We can understand
Gilbert&rsquo;s claim by employing the conceptual framework detailed
in <a href="EpiOrgDevBio">Section 2</a>. Stem cell biology is organized
around the problem of differentiation. This problem consists of a
structured set of specific questions, such as: How is differentiation
into specific cell types regulated? Where and how are stem cells
maintained in different tissues, at different developmental stages,
and in different species? What environmental conditions trigger
de-differentiation of mature cells? These structured questions of stem
cell biology fit within the larger epistemological organization of
developmental biology. </p>

<p>
There is another view, which regards stem cell biology as having a
disciplinary identity because of its being &ldquo;a medical aspect of
developmental biology.&rdquo; Fagan (2013) argues that the clinical
goal is constitutive of stem cell biology for at least three reasons.
First, the clinical goal has historically played crucial roles in
organizing the community of stem cell biologists. For example, it is
only when pluripotent stem cells were explicitly associated with
clinical aims in the late 1990s that a new community was formed around
this technology. Second, it is the clinical goal that maintains the
current disciplinary organization of stem cell biology. The clinical
goal provides a shared, stable focus for diverse models and techniques
and facilitates collaborations between disparate fields in stem cell
biology. Third, the clinical goal shapes &ldquo;gold standards&rdquo;
for stem cell experiments. Among a variety of stem cell lines, human
embryonic stem cells are treated as exemplary, relative to which other
stem cell lines are assessed. This is because human embryonic stem
cells exhibit certain features, such as: &ldquo;wide differentiation
potential, low tumor formation, minimal manipulation, and high
reproductive rate&rdquo; (Fagan 2013, 233). And these traits are
regarded as exemplary because they are advantageous for clinical
applications. </p>

<p>
The contrast between the above two characterizations of stem cell
biology provides a useful insight into our discussion of
epistemological organization. When one focuses on what intellectual
problems stem cell biology addresses, treating it as a subfield of
developmental biology seems justified. Differentiation&mdash;the
central problem of stem cell biology&mdash;is one of the major
problems of developmental biology, and hence stem cell biology&rsquo;s
research questions do fit within the epistemological organization of
developmental biology. Alternatively, one can focus on the fact that
stem cell biology is guided much more strongly by medical interest
than developmental biology in general. Even if stem cell
biology&rsquo;s problems and questions fit within the epistemological
organization of developmental biology, the clinical goal integrates
various attempts to resolve such problems and questions in a distinct
way to form the field of stem cell biology. This idea suggests a
possibility of complementing the conceptual framework discussed
earlier. To characterize the disciplinary identity and epistemological
organization of a field, it is sometimes useful to look beyond the
purely intellectual realm of erotetic structure and consider what
societal values and goals shape the epistemological organization. This
seems important particularly when we characterize fields that are
driven strongly by medical interests, such as stem cell biology,
cancer biology, regeneration biology, and immunology. </p>

<p>
Even if we incorporate the clinical goal into our picture of the
epistemological organization of stem cell biology, the conclusion of
our earlier discussion of erotetic organization still holds here. It
is not a theory that organizes the field of stem cell biology. Like
developmental biology in general, stem cell biology lacks an
overarching theory that plays a unifying role (Fagan 2013,
45&ndash;47).</p>

<h2><a id="StudPlasDeve">6. Studying Plasticity in Development</a></h2>

<p>
Phenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon. It
involves the capacity of a particular genotype to generate phenotypic
variation, often in the guise of qualitatively distinct phenotypes, in
response to differential environmental cues (Pigliucci 2001; DeWitt

One familiar example is seasonal caterpillar morphs that depend on
different nutritional sources (Greene 1989). Some of the relevant
environmental variables include temperature, nutrition,
pressure/gravity, light, predators or stressful conditions, and
population density (Gilbert and Epel 2009). The <em>reaction norm</em>
is a summary of the range of phenotypes, whether quantitatively or
qualitatively varying, exhibited by organisms of a given genotype for
different environmental conditions. When the reaction norm exhibits
discontinuous variation or bivalent phenotypes (rather than
quantitative, continuous variation), it is often labeled
a <em>polyphenism</em> (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<p>
Phenotypic plasticity has been of recurring interest to biological
researchers. Extensive study of phenotypic plasticity has occurred in
the context of quantitative genetic methods and phenotypic selection
analyses, where the extent of plasticity in natural populations has
been demonstrated and operational measures delineated for its
detection (Scheiner 1993; Pigliucci 2001). Other aspects of plasticity
require different investigative methods to ascertain the sources of
plasticity during ontogeny, the molecular genetic mechanisms that
encourage plasticity, and the kinds of mapping functions that exist
between the genotype and phenotype (Pigliucci 2001; Kirschner and
Gerhart 2005: ch. 5). How do molecular genetic mechanisms produce (or
reduce) plasticity? What genotype-phenotype mapping functions are
prevalent or rare? Does plasticity contribute to the origination of
evolutionary novelties (Moczek et al. 2011; West-Eberhard 2003)?</p>

<p>
All reasoning strategies combine distinctive strengths alongside of
latent weaknesses. For example, decomposing a system into its
constituents to understand the features manifested by the system
promotes a dissection of the causal interactions of the localized
constituents, while downplaying interactions with elements external to
the system (Wimsatt 1980; Bechtel and Richardson 1993). Sometimes the
descriptive and explanatory practices of the sciences are successful
precisely because they intentionally ignore aspects of natural
phenomena or use a variety of approximation techniques. Idealization
is one type of reasoning strategy that scientists use to describe,
model, and explain that purposefully departs from features known to be
present in nature. For example, the interior space of a cell is often
depicted as relatively empty even though intracellular space is known
to be crowded (Ellis 2001); the variable of cellular volume takes on a
value that is known to be false (i.e., relatively empty).
Idealizations involve knowingly ignoring variations in properties or
excluding particular values for variables, in a variety of different
ways, for descriptive and explanatory purposes (Jones 2005; Weisberg
2007, 2013).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Normal development&rdquo; is conceptualized through strategies
of abstraction that manage variation inherent within and across
developing organisms (Lowe 2015, 2016). The study of ontogeny in model
organisms is usually executed by establishing a set of normal stages
for embryonic development (see Other Internet Resources). A
developmental trajectory from fertilized zygote to fully-formed adult
is broken down into distinct temporal periods by reference to the
occurrence of major events, such as fertilization, gastrulation, or
metamorphosis (Minelli 2003: ch. 4). This enables researchers in
different laboratory contexts to have standardized comparisons of
experimental results (Hopwood 2005, 2007). They are critical to large
communities of developmental biologists working on well-established
models, such as chick (Hamburger and Hamilton 1951) or zebrafish
(Kimmel et al. 1995): &ldquo;Embryological research is now
unimaginable without such standard series&rdquo; (Hopwood 2005: 239).
These normal stages are a form of idealization because they
intentionally ignore kinds of variation in development, including
variation associated with environmental variables. While facilitating
the study of particular causal relationships, this means that specific
kinds of variation in developmental features are minimized in the
process of rendering ontogeny experimentally tractable (Love
2010).</p>

<p>
In order to evaluate these questions experimentally, researchers need
to alter development through the manipulation of environmental
variables and observe how a novel phenotype can be established within
the existing plasticity of an organism (Kirschner and Gerhart 2005:
ch. 5). This manipulation could allow for the identification of
patterns of variation through the reliable replication of particular
experimental alterations within different environmental regimes.
However, without measuring variation across different environmental
regimes, you cannot observe phenotypic plasticity. These measurements
are required to document the degree of plasticity and its patterns for
a particular trait, such as qualitatively distinct morphs. An
evaluation of the significance of phenotypic plasticity for evolution
requires answers to questions about where plasticity emerges, how
molecular genetic mechanisms are involved in the plasticity, and what
genotype-phenotype relations obtain.</p>

<p>
Developmental stages intentionally ignore variation associated with
phenotypic plasticity. Animals and plants are raised under stable
environmental conditions so that stages can be reproduced in different
laboratory settings and variation is often viewed as noise that must
be reduced or eliminated if one is to understand how development works
(Frankino and Raff 2004). This practice also encourages the selection
of model organisms that exhibit less plasticity (Bolker 1995). The
laboratory domestication of a model organism may also reduce the
amount or type of observable phenotypic variation (Gu et al. 2005),
though laboratory domestication also can increase variation (e.g., via
inbreeding). Despite attempts to reduce variation by controlling
environmental factors, some of it always remains (Lowe 2015) and is
displayed by the fact that absolute chronology is not a reliable
measure of time in ontogeny, and neither is the initiation or
completion of its different parts (Mabee et al. 2000; Sheil and
Greenbaum 2005). Developmental stages allow this recalcitrant
variation to be effectively ignored by judgments of embryonic
typicality. Normal stages also involve assumptions about the causal
connections between different processes across sequences of stages
(Minelli 2003: ch. 4). Once these stages have been constructed, it is
possible to use them as a visual standard against which to recognize
and describe variation as a deviation from the norm (DiTeresi 2010;
Lowe 2016). But, more typically, variation ignored in the construction
of these stages is also ignored in the routine consultation of the
stages in day-to-day research contexts (Frankino and Raff 2004).</p>

<p>
Normal stages fulfill a number of goals related to descriptive and
explanatory endeavors that developmental biologists engage in (Kimmel
et al. 1995). They yield a way to measure experimental replication,
enable consistent and unambiguous communication among researchers,
especially if stages are founded on commonly observable morphological
features, facilitate accurate predictions of developmental phenomena,
and aid in making comparisons or generalizations across species. As
idealizations of ontogeny, normal stages allow for a classification of
developmental events that is comprehensive with suitably sized and
relatively homogeneous stages, reasonably sharp boundaries between
stages, and stability under different investigative conditions
(Dupr&eacute; 2001), which encourages more precise explanations within
particular disciplinary approaches (Griesemer 1996). Idealizations
also can facilitate abstraction and generalization, both of which are
a part of extrapolating findings from the investigative context of a
model organism to other domains (Steel 2008).</p>

<p>
There are various weaknesses associated with normal stages that
accompany the fulfillment of these investigative and explanatory
goals. Key morphological indicators sometimes overlap stages,
terminology that is useful for one purpose may be misleading for
another, particular terms can be misleading in cross-species
comparisons, and manipulation of the embryo for continued observation
can have a causal impact on ontogeny. Avoiding variability in stage
indicators can encourage overlooking the significance of this
variation, or at least provide a reason to favor its minimization.</p>

<p>
Thus, there are good reasons for adopting normal stages to periodize
model organism ontogeny, and these reasons help to explain why their
continued use yields empirical success. However, similar to other
standard (successful) practices in science, normal stages are often
taken for granted, which means their biasing effects are neglected
(Wimsatt 1980). This is critical to recognize because the success of a
periodization is not a function of the eventual ability to relax the
idealizations; periodizations are not slowly corrected so that they
become less idealized. Instead, new periodizations are constructed and
used alongside the existing ones because different idealizations
involve different judgments of typicality that serve diverse
descriptive and explanatory aims. In addition to the systematic biases
involved in developmental staging, most model organisms are poorly
suited to inform us about how environmental effects modulate or
combine with genetic or other factors in development&mdash;they make
it difficult to discover details about mechanisms underlying reaction
norms. Short generation times and rapid development are tightly
correlated with insensitivity to environmental conditions through
various mechanisms such as prepatterning (Bolker 1995).</p>

<p>
The tension between the specific practice of developmental staging in
model organisms and uncovering variation due to phenotypic plasticity
can be reconstructed as an argument.</p>

<ol>

<li>Variation due to phenotypic plasticity is a normal feature of
ontogeny.</li>

<li>The developmental staging of model organisms intentionally
downplays variation in ontogeny associated with the effects of
environmental variables (e.g., phenotypic plasticity) by strictly
limiting the range of values for environmental variables and by
removing variation in characters utilized to establish the
comprehensive periodization.</li>

<li>Therefore, using model organisms with specified developmental
stages will make it difficult, if not impossible, to observe patterns
of variation due to phenotypic plasticity.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Normal stages sometimes encourage developmental biologists to
interpret absence of evidence as evidence of the developmental
insignificance of phenotypic plasticity. This leads to a tension for
research in which variation plays a crucial role, such as evolutionary
inquiry. The documentation of patterns of variation is precisely
what is required to gauge the significance of phenotypic plasticity.
Practices of developmental staging in model organisms can retard our
ability to make either a positive or negative assessment.
Developmental staging, in conjunction with the properties of model
organisms, tends to encourage a negative assessment of the
evolutionary importance of phenotypic plasticity because the variation
is not manifested and documented, and therefore is unlikely to be
reckoned as substantive. Idealizations involving normal stages
discourage a robust experimental probing of phenotypic plasticity,
which is an obstacle to determining its significance.</p>

<p>
The identification of drawbacks that accompany strategies of
idealization used to study development invites consideration of ways
to address the liabilities identified (Love 2010). We can construct a
principled perspective on how to address these liabilities by adding
three further premises:</p>

<ol start="4">

<li>Reasoning strategies involving idealization, such as (2), are
necessary to the successful prosecution of biological investigations
of ontogeny.</li>

<li>Therefore, compensatory tactics should be chosen in such a way as
to specifically redress the blind spots arising from the kind of
idealizations utilized.</li>

<li>Given (1)&ndash;(3), compensatory tactics must be related to the
effects of ignoring variation due to phenotypic plasticity that result
from the developmental staging of model organisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>
At least two compensatory tactics can promote observations of
variation due to phenotypic plasticity that is ignored when
developmental stages are constructed for model organisms: the
employment of diverse model organisms and the adoption of alternate
periodizations.</p>

<p>
Variation often will be observable in non-standard model organisms
because experimental organisms that do not have large communities
built around them are less likely to have had their embryonic
development formally staged and genetically standardized, and
thus the effects of idealization on phenotypic plasticity are not
operative. In turn, researchers are sensitized to the ways in which
these kinds of variation are being muted in the study of standard
models. Stages can be used then as visual standards to identify
variation as deviations from a norm and thereby characterize patterns
of
 variability.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A second compensatory tactic is the adoption of alternative
periodizations. This involves choosing different characters to
construct new temporal partitions, thereby facilitating the
observation of variation with respect to characteristics previously
stabilized in the normal stage periodization. These alternative
periodizations often divide a subset of developmental events according
to processes or landmarks that differ from those used to construct the
normal stages, and they may not map one-one onto the existing normal
stages, especially if they encompass events beyond the trajectory from
fertilization to a sexually mature adult. This lack of isomorphism
between periodizations also will be manifested if different measures
of time are utilized, whether sequence (event ordering) or duration
(succession of defined intervals), and whether sequences or durations
are measured relative to one another or against an external standard,
such as absolute chronology (Reiss 2003; Colbert and Rowe 2008). These
incompatibilities prevent assimilating the alternative periodizations
into a single, overarching staging scheme. In all of these cases,
idealization is involved and therefore each new periodization is
subject to the liabilities of ignoring kinds of variation. However,
alternative periodizations require choosing different characters to
stabilize and typify when defining its temporal partitions, which
means different kinds of variation will be exposed than were
previously
 observable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The compensatory tactics of employing a diversity of model organisms
and adopting alternative periodizations may be conceptually
appropriate for addressing how the practice of developmental staging
has an impact on the detection of phenotypic plasticity, but this does
not remove associated costs (human, financial, and otherwise) or
controversy. The advantages of a single, comprehensive periodization
for a general model organism (e.g., zebrafish normal stages) must be
weighed in light of the advantages of alternative, process-specific
periodizations. However, by openly scrutinizing these practices in
relation to the phenomenon of interest and recognizing both advantages
and drawbacks involved in the idealizations utilized, developmental
biologists are better positioned to offer systematic descriptions and
comprehensive explanations of biological phenomena.</p>

<h2><a id="Con">7. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
This entry has only sampled a small portion of work relevant to the
import and promise of conceptual reflection on the epistemology of
developmental biology. Much more could be said about each of the above
domains, such as a more fine-grained analysis of how normal stages
operate as types in developmental biology (DiTeresi 2010; Lowe 2016).
Additionally, little has been said about how evidence works in
developmental biological experimentation, the nature of differences
between confirmatory and exploratory experimentation (Hall 2005;
O&rsquo;Malley 2007; Waters 2007b), the role of metaphors and models
that characterize key practices in developmental biology (Fagan 2013;
Keller 2002), and different conceptualizations of or theoretical
perspectives on the phenomenon of development (Fagan 2017; Bich and
Skillings 2024). Finally, nothing has been said about the metaphysical
implications of developmental phenomena (a key input for
 <a href="../aristotle-metaphysics/">Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysics</a>).
 Facts about the potentialities of developing embryos have
metaphysical implications, and some have argued that empirical
advances in developmental biology support a new form of essentialism
about biological natural kinds (Austin 2019). Metaphysical issues
also arise in the context of human developmental biology, such as how
to understand the ontology of pregnancy (Kingma 2018; Meincke 2022;
Sidzinska 2017). Thus, developmental biology displays not only a rich
array of material and conceptual practices that can be analyzed to
better understand the scientific reasoning exhibited in experimental
life science, but also points in the direction of new ideas for
metaphysics, especially when that endeavor explicitly considers the
input of empirically successful sciences.</p>
