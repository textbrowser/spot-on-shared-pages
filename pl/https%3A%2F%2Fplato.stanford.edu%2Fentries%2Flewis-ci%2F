<p>
Clarence Irving (C.I.) Lewis was perhaps the most important American
academic philosopher active in the 1930s and 1940s. He made major
contributions in epistemology and logic, and, to a lesser degree,
ethics. Lewis was also a key figure in the rise of analytic philosophy
in the United States, both through the development and influence of
his own writings and through his influence, direct and indirect, on
graduate students at Harvard, including some of the leading analytic
philosophers of the last half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<h2 id="BriBio">1. Brief Biography</h2>

<p>
C.I. Lewis was born on April 12, 1883 in Stoneham, Massachusetts and
died on February 2, 1964 in Menlo Park, California. He was an
undergraduate at Harvard from 1902&ndash;1906, where he was influenced
principally by the pragmatist, William James, and the idealist, Josiah
Royce. Royce also supervised Lewis&rsquo;s 1910 Harvard Ph.D.
dissertation &ldquo; The Place of Intuition in Knowledge&rdquo;. While
serving as Royce&rsquo;s teaching assistant in logic, Lewis read
Whitehead&rsquo;s and Russell&rsquo;s <em>Principia Mathematica</em>,
a book he both admired and criticized. Later, while teaching at the
University of California at Berkeley from 1911&ndash;1920, his
principal research interests switched to logic. Lewis wrote a series
of articles on symbolic logic culminating in his 1918 monograph <em>A
Survey of Symbolic Logic</em> (SSL) (Lewis 1918) in which he both
surveyed developments in symbolic logic from Leibniz up to his own
day, including an extensive discussion of the work of C.S. Peirce, and
presented his own modal system of strict implication. However, in
response to criticism of his account of strict implication, Lewis
deleted it from reprints of SSL and revised his treatment of this
topic for his co-authored 1932 book <em>Symbolic Logic</em> (SL)
(Lewis and Langford 1932) &mdash; &ldquo;the first comprehensive
treatment of systems of strict implication (or indeed of systems of
modal logic at all)&rdquo;, according to Hughes and Cresswell (1968,
216).</p>

<p>
Lewis returned to Harvard in 1920, where he taught until his
retirement in 1953, becoming Edgar Peirce Professor of Philosophy in
1948. At Harvard, Lewis&rsquo; major research interest switched to
epistemology and his work was influenced by the access he had there to
Peirce&rsquo;s unpublished papers. Starting with his much reprinted
1923 article, &ldquo;A Pragmatic Conception of the <em>A
Priori</em>&rdquo; (Lewis 1923), he developed a distinctive position
of his own which he labeled &ldquo;conceptual pragmatism&rdquo; and
which he presented in a systematic way in his 1929 book <em>Mind and
the World Order</em> (MWO) (Lewis 1929). MWO established Lewis as a
major figure on the American philosophical scene. In the 1930s and
1940s, partly in response to the challenge of positivism, the form and
focus of Lewis&rsquo; views changed, and, arguably, in subtle ways,
some of the substance. In his 1946 book <em>Analysis of Knowledge and
Valuation</em> (AKV), based on his 1944 Carus lectures, Lewis (1946)
provided a systematic and carefully analytic presentation of his
mature philosophical views. The first two thirds of the book consist
of a thorough refinement and more precise presentation of his theory
of meaning and of his epistemological views, and the last third
consists of a presentation of his theory of value.</p>

<p>
After retirement from Harvard, Lewis taught and lectured at a number
of universities, including Princeton, Columbia, Indiana, Michigan
State, and Southern California, but principally at Stanford. His 1954
Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia and 1956 Mahlon Powell Lectures at
Indiana resulted in two last short books in ethics, <em>The Ground and
the Nature of the Right</em> (Lewis 1955) and <em>Our Social
Inheritance</em> (Lewis 1957). Lewis was the subject of a posthumously
published &ldquo;Library of Living Philosophers&rdquo; volume (Schilpp
1968) in which, unfortunately, his replies to critics were limited by
illness, but which, nonetheless, was an honour that indicates his
standing in and perceived significance for American philosophy in the
1950s.</p>

<p>
In his over thirty years at Harvard, Lewis taught some of the most
eminent American philosophers of the last half of the twentieth
century as graduate students, including Brand Blanshard, W.V. Quine,
Nelson Goodman, Roderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, and Wilfrid
Sellars. Although only Blanshard, Goodman, Chisholm, and Firth of
these were supervised by Lewis, and Sellars left Harvard without
graduating for academic employment, all refer occasionally to Lewis in
their writings, usually critically, and their own views sometimes
developed in reaction to his.</p>

<h2 id="OveConPra">2. Overview of Conceptual Pragmatism</h2>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, Chp. 1) argued that the proper method of
philosophy isn&rsquo;t transcendental but reflective. Philosophy seeks
to elicit the criteria or principles of the real, the right, the
beautiful, and the logically valid that are implicit in human
experience, thought, and activity.</p>

<p>
Human beings are reflective, deliberative, self-critical and
self-governing animals who don&rsquo;t simply respond to current
experience or emotive affect in thought and action. They act for
reasons that apply to other cases as well and are formulatable as
criticizable principles, directive, or imperatives in terms of which
we can also criticize and correct even habitual modes of thought and
action (Lewis 1955a, 86; Lewis 1953 [1969, 156]; Lewis 1959 [1969,
79]). Right doing for Lewis turns on right thinking. Objectively right
action isn&rsquo;t simply subjectively right action the agent thinks
has overall good consequences (for the agent in the case of the
prudentially right or for others as well in the case of the morally
right.) Objectively right action is action that the agent is justified
on all the evidence in so thinking (Lewis 1955a, 55).</p>

<p>
Throughout his career, from MWO to OSI, Lewis thought that we were the
products of evolution with similar needs and powers of discrimination,
relation, and judgement, confronted by a common reality mediated
through comparable sense experience (Lewis 1929, 91). However, we are
also the products of socialization, benefitting from socially
inherited institutions and practices, from education and learning from
others, and from co-operation with others, all facilitated by
communicating with others through a common language and definitions we
also learn from others, all of which in turn facilitates our
intellectual, moral, material, and political progress together. Verbal
definitions relating symbols to symbols set up patterns and structures
of orderly relation and give rise to knowledge of such, but are
applicable in principle to quite diverse subject matters or characters
of experience. (Lewis, 1926 [1970, 241&ndash;7]; Lewis 1946, 142).
However, our concepts and meanings are revealed, &ldquo;from the
outside&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 102) as modes of &ldquo;congruous
behaviour&rdquo; (Lewis 1926 [1970, 248]), drawing distinctions and
making connections in language and other behaviour that are congruent
with those drawn by others in our interactions with them. In MWO Lewis
calls these the shared or &ldquo;pure&rdquo; concepts expressed in a
common language, but notes that &ldquo;a human being without fellows
&hellip; would still frame concepts in terms of the relation between
his own behaviour and his environment&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 117) .
Nonetheless, what allows us to understand each other, to the extent we
can, according to Lewis (1929, 110&ndash;11), is that &ldquo;we are
able to identify, each in his own experience, those systems of orderly
relations indicated by behaviour, and particularly that part of
behaviour that serves the ends of co-operation&rdquo;, even were our
experience qualitatively different.</p>

<p>
On reflection on our cognitive experience and perceptual knowledge,
Lewis (1929, 37&ndash;8) believed that we can abstract and distinguish
three elements found together: (1) the given or immediate data of
sense, (2) the act of interpreting the given as an experience of one
sort of thing as opposed to another, and (3) the concept and criteria
for its application by which we so interpret the given by relating it
to other possibilities of experience. Our experience of the real is
not given to us in experience but is constructed by us from the data
of sense through acts of interpretation. When I know that I am looking
at a table and reflect on my experience, I realize, on analysis, that
there are certain highly specific but repeatable and recognizable
sensuous qualities (sense <em>qualia</em> ) presented to me in
experience that I am immediately aware of. Moreover, I realize that,
in the light of this and other experiences I recall, I expect, with
some likelihood, I would have certain other experiences, e.g. of
feeling something apparently hard, were I to have the experience of
performing certain acts, e.g. of reaching out with my hand. In doing
so, it is the concept of seeing a table that I am applying to my
experience rather than that of seeing a horse or that of hallucinating
a table, either of which would have involved different expectations of
experience consequent upon action (Lewis 1929, 143). Knowledge
&ldquo;must always concern principally the relations which obtain
between one experience and another, particularly those in which the
knower himself may enter as an active factor&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 117).
Only an active being can therefore have knowledge, and the principal
function of empirical knowledge &ldquo;is that of an instrument
enabling transition from the actual present to a future which is
desired and which the present is believed to signalize&rdquo; (Lewis
1946, 4).</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;totality of the possible experiences in which any
interpretation would be verified&mdash;the completest possible
empirical verification which is conceivable&rdquo;, Lewis (1929, 32)
says, is the &ldquo;entire meaning which an interpretation has&rdquo;
(in some sense of &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;). Lewis (1946, 180, 208) later
says that statements expressing our beliefs about reality are
translatable into, and thus entail and are entailed by, an
indefinitely large set of counterfactual statements about what
experiences we would have or would be likely to have, were we to be
presented with certain sensory cues and were we to carry out further
tests (Lewis 1929, 130, 142&ndash;3; 1946, 180, 208). As
counterfactuals, these statements can be true even if the experiences
they concern never obtain and thus so can the objective beliefs that
imply them. As a result, Lewis insists that the truth of our objective
beliefs, as opposed to the believing or confirming them, is not
&ldquo;mind-dependent&rdquo;. The idea of a reality neither
confirmable nor disconfirmable in principle by experience was for
Lewis (1954 [1970, 332&ndash;3]) without &ldquo;empirical
meaning&rdquo;, but this did not mean that the physical table was just
&ldquo;the sum of its various appearances in experience&rdquo; . What
distinguished his verificationism, he thought, from the superficially
similar verification principle of meaning of the logical positivists
was his emphasis on the mediating role of agency in knowledge and
verification, relating the given to the &ldquo;to-be-given&rdquo; or
&ldquo;could-be given&rdquo; and correcting or confirming the
resultant anticipations, rather than construing our knowledge simply
as a system of logically related sentences or statements, one class of
which gives meaning and confirmation to the other. (Lewis 1941a [1970,
94]).</p>

<p>
Objectively, what we actually experience may depend on the physical
circumstances of perception, e.g. lighting conditions, and the bodily
actions we perform, e.g. moving our eyes, as well as the character of
objects in our environment. And in much everyday practice and
scientific practice, hypotheses are tested with the help of other
generalizations previously accepted about the way the world works
(Lewis 1936b [1970, 282]). However, what matters ultimately for the
meaning and confirmation of statements about objective reality, Lewis
(1946, 178&ndash;9, 245&ndash;6) makes clear are only the &ldquo;felt
experience&rdquo; of action and the directly presentable sense
experiences contained in sensory cues and forming the experiential
circumstances of action ), as well as the directly presentable sense
experiences they lead us to expect. An alternative was urged by
Chisholm (1948) and Quine (1951) (and suggested by Lewis (1929, 286)
himself in one place, albeit not by Lewis (1929, 318, 332, 336)
elsewhere in MWO): &ldquo;no statement of objective fact has
consequences for direct experience without further premises specifying
objective conditions of perception&rdquo; (Lewis 1948a [1970, 318]),
including we might add, objective conditions of agency. However, in
response Lewis (1948a [1970, 318]) rejects the alternative, saying
that if it were right, &ldquo;the type of empiricism of which my
account is one variant&ndash;verification-theories and
confirmation-theories&ndash;will be altogether indefensible&rdquo;.
The result, he adds, would be a fatally flawed &ldquo;coherence theory
of empirical truth&rdquo; that leaves us with &ldquo;nothing &hellip;
but skepticism&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The direct apprehension of immediately given sense presentations and
their specific but repeatable <em>qualia</em> makes no predictions
concerning experience, is incorrigible, indubitable, not in need of
verification, and not subject to error, and so, in these various (and
distinct) senses, &ldquo;certain&rdquo;. (For a useful discussion of
senses of &ldquo;certainty&rdquo; in Lewis, see Firth 1964, and Firth
1968 in Schilpp 1968.) However, with no possibility of error or
incorrectness to contrast with the immediate awareness of the given,
Lewis decides the normative label &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;
shouldn&rsquo;t be applied to it. Objective interpretations of
experience, on the other hand, are not only fallible&mdash;given and
recalled experience doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the satisfaction of our
expectations of future experience&mdash;but are always subject to
revision in the light of action and further experience. Yet, the terms
we must employ to express or convey our apprehension of the given must
be borrowed from objective language used to convey our objective
interpretations of experience and communicate with others.</p>

<p>
Whether our objective beliefs are true depends on their verifiable or
confirmable implications for future possible experience. However, in
order to guide action effectively now while saving us from the hazards
of action without foresight, empirical belief and its expectations for
experience must be justified (rationally credible, warranted) now,
antecedent to future confirmation (Lewis 1946, 9. 254&ndash;7).
Justification, as opposed to verification, is the focus of AKV much
more so than MWO, and touched on in late writings discussing the
ethics of belief. Nonetheless, throughout Lewis&rsquo; career from MWO
to the end, there are common claims. First, empirical knowledge
(rationally credible, justified, or warranted belief) is probable
knowledge or belief. Second, probability is a logical or inferential
relation between a conclusion and its premises or grounds. Third, the
ultimate premises or grounds relative to which a conclusion or belief
is probable must themselves be certain, not merely probable, and thus
may be &ldquo;verbally quite remote&rdquo;, in contrast to more
immediate or proximate ones that we might ordinarily cite to justify
our beliefs (Lewis 1929, 328&ndash;9; Lewis 1952a [1970]). As a
result, the probability not only of our perceptual beliefs but the
expectations and predictions of future experience and its patterns
they involve can&rsquo;t ultimately be relative to premises or grounds
consisting of beliefs about the world and the objective circumstances
of perception, past or present, that are merely probable, rather than
certain. Instead, fourth, the ultimate premises or grounds &ldquo;must
be actual given data for the individual&rdquo; that are certain
((Lewis 1929, 329, 337, 340&ndash;1; Lewis 1946, 186&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Ordinary beliefs and interpretations, including perceptual beliefs,
are, for Lewis, typically the product of habit or association in which
we are guided by the elements of the given in the epistemological
present but rarely if ever attend to them. Nonetheless, the
justification of these beliefs as rationally credible requires that
there be an inferential or logical relationship of a belief or a
statement of it to grounds or reasons in experience that constitute
evidence, largely inductive, for it (Lewis 1946, 315; Lewis 1952a
[1970, 326]). For Lewis (1946, 329), &ldquo;the critical question for
the validity of empirical knowledge is not whether grounds sufficient
for the justification of the belief are actually contained in the
explicit psychological state of the believer, but whether the
knower&rsquo;s situation in empirical belief is such that sufficient
grounds could be elicited upon inquiry, or whether it is such that
this is even theoretically impossible&rdquo;. Restricting the term
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to cases where grounds are explicit would
&ldquo;be so rigoristic as to exclude most, if not all, of our
attempted cognitions and would obscure the important distinction of
practically valuable knowledge from &lsquo;ignorance&rsquo; and from
&lsquo;error&rsquo;&rdquo;, just as restricting the term to what we
are certain of would. Nor does Lewis (1946, 330&ndash;2) think that
the act of reflecting on and eliciting what in the epistemological
present justifies our beliefs loses that justification. Knowing for
Lewis occurs in a non-instantaneous, temporally extended
&ldquo;epistemological present&rdquo; of sense presentation embedded
in a mass of recollections or sense of past experience (Lewis 1946,
331&ndash;2) within which they can be reflected on and elicited.
Moreover, past justifying grounds can be remembered on reflection.</p>

<p>
The probability of our perceptual belief and expectations of
experience isn&rsquo;t simply a matter of the natural or objective
frequency with which such beliefs are true or expectations fulfilled,
or of their propensity for such, in the face of the sensory data and
memories that stimulate them. Lewis rejects frequency and propensity
understandings of probability (advocated by Peirce and others) for a
version of the logical theory of probability. Probability is a logical
relation between a conclusion and premises or grounds in the light of
its various <em>a priori</em> governing principles, including
principles of induction. So what are the &ldquo;premises&rdquo;
elicited and made explicit on reflection? If they are beliefs,
linguistically expressed or not, cued to and responsive to experience
and its patterns in ways that allow us to anticipate future experience
and draw distinctions that facilitate cooperation, but which
themselves concern present and past experience only in so far as we
objectively conceptualize that experience, <em>e.g</em> as tasting
sugar, or in more minimal but still objective comparative terms,
tasting as sugar usually tastes (Lewis 1929, 126, 290), together with
various other beliefs about the world and the way it works, then we
have premises relative to which other beliefs may be probable,
including beliefs about future experiences. However, all these beliefs
will themselves involve their own predictions and be probable only
relative to yet further premises. Much of our everyday or scientific
practice of justifying beliefs to ourselves and others with available
&ldquo;proximate&rdquo; premises may take this form (Lewis 1946,
326&ndash;7) and is not out of place with much of the presentation in
MWO. However, it seems to commit him to a coherence theory of
empirical knowledge that Lewis (1936b [1970, 289&ndash;93]) explicitly
rejects. It also contradicts his explicit account of probability and
its constraints in Lewis (1929, 328&ndash;9) as well as the role of
primitive &ldquo;generalization from direct experience&rdquo; in the
probability of our interpretations of sense presentation giving us
knowledge of particular objects which in turn is &ldquo;the
basis&rdquo; of more sophisticated inductive generalizations about
objective reality (Lewis 1929, 332, 336&ndash;7). On the other hand,
Lewis&rsquo; account of the psychology and phenomenology of the given
in MWO raises questions about how the given could be both suitably
available and have the right semantic and logical character to serve
as the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; grounds relative to which our beliefs
are probable, as we shall discuss in Section 3.</p>

<p>
Past experience and our recollection of it play a key role in the
credibility of our interpretations. Their inductive probability and
credibility rests on premises or grounds concerning past experience as
well as present experience. In MWO, Lewis (1929, 337) says that memory
itself is an interpretation of given present recollection, and, as
such, probable knowledge with testable or verifiable implications for
future experience (Lewis 1946, 337). However, this doesn&rsquo;t
explain what warrants the interpretation and its expectations unless
it is simply other objective beliefs, including further beliefs about
the past, which seems to lead again to a coherence theory of empirical
justification. This is an issue and a <em>lacuna</em> AKV corrects.
What is given and indubitably certain in this present are these sense
presentations and these rememberings (Lewis 1946, 354, 362)), but what
we recall of past experience is <em>prima facie</em> and
non-inductively credible for us, just because so ostensibly remembered
or recalled (Lewis 1946, 334), and thus can serve to make our
expectations of future experience rationally credible as well.</p>

<p>
Despite their lack of theoretical certainty, the beliefs we form by
applying concepts to experience may count as knowledge so long as they
are true and sufficiently warranted or justified. The members of a set
of beliefs and expectations of experience that already have some
degree of confirmation or antecedent probability in relation to
present and past experience may become even more credible if the
antecedent probability of any one would be increased by assuming the
others as given (Lewis 1946, 187, 338, 349, 351, 352). This
<em>congruence</em> of a mature system of beliefs which exhibits this
complex interlocking pattern of &ldquo;compounding&rdquo; (Lewis 1929,
336&ndash;7) probability relations to each other and to experience
helps to explain how these beliefs can rise to the standards for
knowledge and how they (and the predictions of experience they lead us
to make) can be practically certain enough to be counted on in
action.</p>

<p>
We can&rsquo;t directly verify the existence of other subjects of
experience or what is given to them in experience. Nonetheless,
importantly for ethics, Lewis (1934 [1970, 275&ndash;6]) claimed that
by empathy, in terms of our own conscious experience, we can imagine
or envisage the conscious experience of others, rather than simply our
own experience of others and our objectively conceptualized beliefs
about their bodies and our behavioural interactions with them.
Moreover, relying on a distinction between direct and indirect
verification and confirmation, the supposition of another
consciousness like ours, with a body like ours, and similar to us in
some ways (perhaps at least identifying in terms of its experience
patterns of orderly behaviour that serve the ends of cooperation) can
be indirectly confirmed and supported by induction (1941b [1970,
301&ndash;2]). Our understanding of others as subjects of experience
and the experiences they have is not for Lewis an understanding of
those experiences simply in terms of their manifestations in our
experience. What takes us beyond the epistemological present and the
egocentric situation of the knower then are imagination and empathy,
but also principles of probability and credibility (Lewis 1946,
357ff). Memory gives us <em>prima facie</em> but non-inductively
credible access to past experience to supply, together with current
experience, grounds for inductively cogent expectations of future (and
more distantly past) experience and its patterns that we can envisage,
all reinforced, amplified and made more credible by their congruence
with each other and other beliefs. In all this, there is a key
distinction to be emphasized, Lewis (1934 [1970, 264&ndash;8]) thinks,
between what is cognized and the current cognizing of it.</p>

<p>
In MWO Lewis argues that probable empirical knowledge requires, on
pain of infinite regress, some <em>a priori</em> knowledge of analytic
principles explicating our concepts, their logical relationships, and
the criteria for applying them to experience and determining what is
real and what isn&rsquo;t real. Moreover, this knowledge must be
&ldquo;more than probable&rdquo; and &ldquo;certain&rdquo;, which
suggests that they have a degree of warrant greater than the degree of
probability empirical considerations could yield (Lewis 1929,
311&ndash;12, 317, 321). In the case of abstract mathematics
applicable to any possible experience and formal logic applicable to
different subject matters, analytic truths or meaning relations are
known through definitions and their purely logical implications.
(Lewis 1946, 122&ndash;30, 145&ndash;57). Lewis (1946, 29) notes that
mathematical and logical cognitions &ldquo;may be certain&rdquo;, at
least in certain cases, but he worries how they can refer to anything
beyond the cognition itself, and be classified as knowledge, if their
truth is simply the unthinkability of their falsity, given our
concepts or way of thinking. He answers that we can be mistaken about
what is implicit in our concepts. We can fail to observe what is
implicit in them and definitions and what their adoption consistently
commits us to in our thinking, and that contrast with error allows him
to classify such <em>a priori</em> apprehension as knowledge.
Nonetheless, any of these mistakes is &ldquo;intrinsically possible of
correction merely by taking thought of the matter&rdquo; (Lewis 1946,
155) without empirical investigation. The same is true of our
categorical <em>a priori</em> knowledge of more particular principles
or criteria for interpreting experience (Lewis 1929, 275). The
principles governing our concepts thus can be known <em>a priori</em>,
independently of confirmation in experience, in so far as they can be
certified or assured simply by analysis of meanings or reflection on
the content of our concepts, our explicative principles and
classificatory intentions (Lewis 1946, 31, 151, 165), and their
logical implications. So, quite apart from issues about certainty, the
degree to which we are warranted in our <em>a priori</em>
apprehensions isn&rsquo;t a function of their probability on the total
set of empirical considerations (<em>cf</em>. Lewis 1926 [1970, 224],
Sellars 1953 [1963, 299&ndash;300]).</p>

<p>
What then is tested and confirmed or disconfirmed by experience is the
interpretation of experience in the light of our concepts and
explicative principles. What isn&rsquo;t tested by experience is the
validity of the concepts themselves, or the logical relationships
amongst them, or the principles for applying them. Agents bring them
to experience and the only criteria they answer to are pragmatic ones
like utility or convenience or simplicity of the belief system
employing them. (Lewis 1929, 271&ndash;2). That implies that our
decision to adopt them is also revisable on pragmatic grounds, as
Lewis himself recognizes he is doing with the concept of knowledge
itself (Lewis 1946, 27&ndash;29, 188). However, empirical beliefs
presuppose <em>a priori</em> beliefs and so revising what <em>a
priori</em> beliefs we have will also lead to changing the former, and
more dramatically so in a mature, complex system of probabilistically
interconnected empirical beliefs and concept. For a simple example,
the empirical belief (a) that there are no unicorns presupposes the
concepts of unicorn and negation and more general <em>a priori</em>
principles governing negation and explicating the concept of a
unicorn, <em>e.g</em>. (b) that if anything is a unicorn it is a
horse-like creature with a horn in its nose. Repeatedly failing to
apply the concept of unicorn to experience might make (a) practically
certain and lead us to drop the concept altogether from our conceptual
repertoire as useless clutter, along with beliefs (a) and (b).
Experience can thus lead us to revise our <em>a priori</em> beliefs,
though with logical principles, given their centrality to our whole
system of belief, <em>a priori</em> and empirical, and the massive
alteration that would require, we may be reluctant to do so on
pragmatic grounds (Lewis 1923 [1970, 236&ndash;7]; 1929, 306).
However, experience won&rsquo;t have done so by disconfirming (b).
&ldquo;What simplicity and convenience determine is not truth or even
probability but merely simplicity or convenience&rdquo;, Lewis (1936b
[1970, 286]) says. They may give us a reason for no longer believing
(b) but not a reason for believing (b) is false or less likely to be
true. They don&rsquo;t determine epistemic justification concerning
our &ldquo;purely <em>cognitive</em> interest in (the) validity and
truth&rdquo; of what is believed rather than &ldquo;ulterior&rdquo;
interests knowledge serves (Lewis 1946, 441; 1955a, 34). What makes
the principles explicating concepts something we are warranted in
believing to be true, for Lewis, are neither pragmatic considerations
favouring their adoption nor their empirical probability, but our
<em>a priori</em> reflection on our concepts and the criteria for
their application.</p>

<p>
In an extended discussion of the interplay of pragmatic
considerations, coherence, and empirical evidence in empirical belief
and its probable truth, Lewis (1936b [1970, 281&ndash;90]) notes that
sometimes considerations of evidence and probability won&rsquo;t
suffice to decide choices about empirical beliefs to accept or reject,
especially when faced with a complex body of interlocking beliefs.
Probability on the evidence can underdetermine choice: &ldquo;In the
absence of any more decisive criterion&rdquo;, pragmatic factors like
simplicity or convenience come to the fore in the acceptance of
&ldquo;working hypotheses&rdquo;, at least temporarily. However, Lewis
(1936b [1970, 286] ) says &ldquo;no hypothesis was ever a bit more
probable for having been simple or otherwise convenient&rdquo;. The
desire to make the least disruption to our system of belief in the
face of disconfirming experience (perhaps for the sake of action, not
just whim) may lead us to hold onto beliefs, at least until we have
further and more decisive tests, even when, in the face of
recalcitrant experience, some of them are now less probable and
trustworthy for action. However, that conservativism doesn&rsquo;t
make them more probable in relation to the evidence in a congruent
system of belief than they were. In a more challenging sort of case,
less crude concepts might allow us to make finer grained distinctions
in experience, and, with scientific and technological developments
they make possible (<em>e.g.</em> electron telescopes), increase the
range and variety of available experience, thereby making for more and
stronger probabilistic connections in a more complex but more
congruent system of belief . As a result, the empirical beliefs our
new concepts make possible may be more probable in relation to
experience and the rest of our beliefs than our former empirical
beliefs framed in our former concepts were (Bonjour, 1985, Chps
6&ndash;8). So it seems here that a criterion for the adoption of new
concepts and explicative principles is the prospect for beliefs that
are more probable relative to experience and a congruent system of
belief than our old beliefs, and the achievement of such a congruent
system and the prospect for further fruitful investigation a criterion
for the retention of these concepts. In response to this sort of
suggestion, citing the case of the heliocentric theory of the universe
vs the geocentric and the role of the telescope, Lewis (1929,
269&ndash;71) suggests that an overall probable system of belief could
in principle be achieved with either set of guiding principles and
thus the criterion for choice is pragmatic. Perhaps, but this
isn&rsquo;t so clear, and a possible equiprobable alternative is not
thereby an available one. The issues here seem more complex than
Lewis&rsquo; dichotomies (pragmatic vs empirically probable) might
suggest.</p>

<p>
In a late paper on realism and phenomenalism, Lewis (1955b, [1970,
345&ndash;7]) says he prefers to think of himself as a sort of
realist. What we experience depends on our own nature and on the
nature of objects in themselves. There are objects &ldquo;existent are
they are in themselves&rdquo;, i.e. distinct from us conscious beings,
with &ldquo;objective properties, which are potentialities resident in
the nature of them as they objectively exist&rdquo; to manifest
themselves in experience in such a way that conditionals about
experience hold, namely those which express the implicit expectations
of experience we have when we objectively interpret given experience
in perception, together with whatever we might validly infer
probabilistically from &ldquo;the observable interactions of objects
with one another&rdquo;. &ldquo;This manner of knowing suffices for
all that we conceivably might be able to accomplish in any world of
things existing independently of being known by us&rdquo;, Lewis
(1955b [1970, 346]) adds, apart perhaps from some
&ldquo;curiosity&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t preclude properties we
don&rsquo;t yet know about or have concepts or terms for. Nor does it
preclude properties &ldquo;forever beyond our finding out&rdquo; or
whose nature other creatures might be able to apprehend with
capacities for experience and discrimination radically different from
ours, but which we are not able to.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1955b [1970]) gives no indication that he thinks his
ontological position had changed significantly over the years, but it
may have or at least become clearer. However, his account of meaning
did. Lewis (1929, 37, 115, 121) says (A) that concepts
&ldquo;denote&rdquo; the temporally extended complexes or patterns of
actual and possible sense qualia that are criterial for their
application and &ldquo;the empirical object&rdquo; denoted just is
this pattern, suggesting perhaps an &ldquo;ontological
phenomenalism&rdquo; (B) that empirical objects are nothing but these
complexes. Lewis (1946, 137; 1954 [1970, 333]) calls (A) a
&ldquo;confusion&rdquo; and denies that his verificationism implies
(B). The denotation of a term consists of what is actual, not
possible, and the sense criteria for its application constitute its
sense meaning and belong to its intension or connotation, not
denotation. Nor does it sit well with his views throughout his career
on the communicative and cooperative purposes of language. &ldquo;It
is essential for the purposes of language&rdquo; that
&ldquo;individuals should signalize the same objective realities by
the same language&rdquo;, but &ldquo;the presence of the same
objects&rdquo; can be signalized to individuals without them
&ldquo;necessarily sharing the same sensory criteria of
application&rdquo;(Lewis (1946, 143). Even in MWO, Lewis (1929,
78&ndash;9) says we can &ldquo;verify common meaning&rdquo; through
common verbal definitions, or by &ldquo;exhibiting&rdquo; or
&ldquo;exemplifying its denotation&rdquo; in behaviour and
&ldquo;examples pointed to&rdquo;, but we don&rsquo;t exhibit our
sense <em>qualia</em> to each other in our behaviour. Two people in
their linguistic and other &ldquo;congruous&rdquo; behaviour might be
systematically distinguishing the same things and their orderly
relations by their use of the terms &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and
&ldquo;cat&rdquo;, distinguishing the barkers from the meowers, so to
speak, and so it seems referring to and thus denoting the same things,
albeit by identifying those relations in their own potentially quite
different sense experience. What clearly doesn&rsquo;t change in his
view is that objects are known empirically by us only so far as there
are potentialities for experience that are criterial for the
application of concepts and what we may infer from that application.
The issue remains of whether these potentialities can be spelled out
without assuming some conditions about the objective circumstances of
perception and the way the objective world works.</p>

<p>
Right at the heart of Lewis&rsquo; philosophical system, then, are
several theses that weren&rsquo;t original to Lewis, but the critical
discussion (and sometimes rejection) of which, sometimes in the form
Lewis gave to them, was central to much analytic philosophy in the
last half of the twentieth century. Among them are: (1) an epistemic
distinction between <em>a priori</em> and a <em>posteriori</em>
warrant or knowledge, and a semantic distinction between
<em>analytic</em> and <em>synthetic</em> truth (2) reductionism
concerning the meaning, in some sense, of physical object statements
to the actual and possible sense experiences that would confirm them
(3) an epistemic foundation for all empirical knowledge in our direct
apprehension or immediate awareness of the given character of
experience and our recollections of it, and (4) the division of
experience into its given content or character, on the one hand, and
the form we impose on it, or the concepts in the light of which we
interpret it, on the other. (Quine 1951) famously called (1) and (2)
the &ldquo;two dogmas of empiricism&rdquo;; Sellars (1963) called (3)
the &ldquo;myth of the given&rdquo;; and Davidson (1973&ndash;1974])
called (4) the &ldquo;third dogma of empiricism&rdquo;, although in
Lewis&rsquo; mind (4) may owe more to Kant&mdash;on whom Lewis taught
a course regularly at Harvard&mdash;than to the empiricists.) At the
same time, Lewis (1946, 9&ndash;11, 254&ndash;9) also laid down a
framework of assumptions, most explicitly in AKV, within which
analytic epistemology flourished in the last half of the
20<sup>th</sup> century: (1) knowledge is sufficiently justified
(warranted, rationally credible) true belief, (2) a belief may be
justified without being true and true without being justified, and (3)
epistemology seeks to elicit criteria or principles of justification
or rationally credibility. Lewis&rsquo; views on some of these issues
will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>

<h2 id="Giv">3. The Given</h2>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo; views about the given are at once among his best known
and most criticized. The pre-analytic datum for philosophical
reflection is our &ldquo;thick&rdquo; experience and knowledge of the
world around us, but reflection on this experience and knowledge
reveals two elements: the given or immediate data of experience and
the activity of thought whereby we conceptually interpret the given.
The given in sense experience consists of specific sensuous qualities
that we are immediately aware of when, for example, we take ourselves
to be seeing or hearing or tasting or smelling or touching something,
or even to be hallucinating or dreaming instead. These distinct
qualities or <em>qualia</em> are the repeatable felt characters of
experience, a type of &ldquo;universal&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 123), and
include the felt goodness or felt badness of particular experiences or
stretches of experience, as well as qualities of sight, sound, taste,
smell, touch, motion, and other familiar modes of sense experience.
When we conceptually interpret the given, we form hypothetical
expectations and make predictions, in the light of past experience,
concerning experiences we would have were we to engage in specific
actions, and so, in applying concepts, as Kant suggests, we relate our
experiences to each other. Usually, we do so automatically and without
conscious reflection, in ways that express habitual attitudes and
associations rather than engaging in (explicit) inference. What we
recall of past experience, even immediately, isn&rsquo;t given to us
or certain, but our immediate recollection or sense of past experience
as having been so and so is given to us (Lewis 1946, 353), and so is
our awareness of the qualitative similarity of current sense
experience to experience as ostensibly remembered or mnemically
presented.(Lewis 1929, 125; 1936b [1970, 289]). That is important both
for Lewis&rsquo; ethics and the comparative value of experience, and,
potentially, for inductive inference. The given, unlike our
interpretation of it, isn&rsquo;t alterable by our will (Lewis 1929,
52) and consists of what remains when we subtract from ordinary
perceptual cognition all that could conceivably be mistaken (Lewis
1946, 182&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, 51, 402) says that the given in cognition never
occurs in the absence of interpretation and characterizes the
distinction as an &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; of elements that are
synthesized in our judgment, but which we may realize are common to
quite different conceptualizations such as those of the adult and the
child and perhaps can be retained in memory (Lewis 1929, 49&ndash;50.
53). Lewis (1926 [1970, 249]; 1946, 437) cites the passive absorption
in the sound of symphonic music without any attempt to analyze the
musical experience as an instance of pure, unabstracted awareness of
the sensuous qualities in given experience. However this is a product
of the &ldquo;aesthetic attitude&rdquo; of &ldquo;distinterested
interest in the presented as such&rdquo; , &ldquo;attentiveness to the
given in its own right&rdquo;, which is &ldquo;not of necessity
mutually exclusive&rdquo; of, but is still in contrast to, the
cognitive attitude&rsquo;s concern with prediction and the practical
or moral attitude&rsquo;s concern with attaining absent goods (Lewis
1946, 437&ndash;43), Further, when we passively take in and enjoy the
visual experience presented from where we are sitting, it seems clear
we are presented with a vast, complex array of sense <em>qualia</em>,
and how much awareness of sensory <em>qualia</em> and their similarity
to past experience as mnemically presented for the purposes of
prediction would require selective attention and demarcation of qualia
(Lewis 1929, 58; 1946, 424), AKV is more circumspect. Although the
given is what we are immediately aware of or directly apprehend as it
guides and corrects our interpretations, it isn&rsquo;t something we
focus on or attend to or are clearly conscious of in our automatic
interpretations, any more than in riding a bicycle we attend to or
focus on the various sensory and motion and balance sensations that
are elements in and guide our activity, though we could on
reflection&mdash;perhaps not for long without falling off&mdash;and
perhaps did so in learning (Lewis 1946, 10, 172&ndash;5). In
perceptual cognition, what is given in sense experience serves as a
natural sign of future experience contingent on action in the light of
past experience, and prompts the anticipation of such experience. What
is given is of no interest to active beings apart from what it
signifies for future experience and anticipations it prompts for
action. (Lewis 1946, 10). Is practical and cognitive need here
implicitly dictating selective attention and making
&ldquo;premises&rdquo; available (Lewis 1929, 50)?</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, Lewis (1952a [1970, 326]) says &ldquo;the
<em>validity</em> of this interpretation is that and that only which
could attach to it as an inductive inference from the given visual
presentation &hellip; the incorrigible presentational element&rdquo;.
What matters for the credibility or warrant or validity of the belief
is that there is a logical, inferential relation between the belief
and grounds in experience that prompt it in the light of past
experience and that can be elicited on critical reflection and its
character made clear enough for our theoretical purposes. However, the
credibility or validity of the belief isn&rsquo;t created by the
reflective attempt to elicit sufficient grounds (Lewis 1946, 186, 189,
262, 329&ndash;32). Probability, for Lewis, is a logical relation
between a conclusion and premises, and a statement is categorically
assertable with a degree of probability or credibility, or a belief
warranted to that degree, as opposed to being merely hypothetically
probable <em>a priori</em> to that degree on premises, only to the
extent that the premises or data are sufficiently warranted or
probable. (Lewis 1946, 315&ndash;27). Ultimately, the conclusion must
be warranted or probable on premises or data that are certain, not
just true, and that are not just warranted or credible only on other
premises or data, even if we never reach these ultimate premises
ordinarily in showing probability or justification. Otherwise we have
&ldquo;an indefinite regress of the merely probable &hellip; and the
probability will fail to be genuine&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 186). Here he
echoes MWO (1929, 328&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
The given, thus, plays a causal role as the ultimate or remote ground
responsible for belief, the &ldquo;to-be-given&rdquo; a semantic role
as the content of the predictions implied by our objective belief, and
the given an epistemic role as the ultimate justifying grounds of
empirical belief (Lewis 1946, 262, 328&ndash;30). Lewis is defending a
normative standard for empirical knowledge that he thinks is implicit
in cognition and revealed on reflection but which is also
psychologically and &ldquo;verbally remote&rdquo; from everyday
cognitive practices of justifying beliefs to ourselves or others in
the light of more proximate assumptions, often taken for granted in
the context of inquiry or discussion. That may also make some of his
presentation and discussion of examples, expressed in everyday
language, misleading. In any case, many pragmatists might feel there
is tension here.</p>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, 53) says that the given is
&ldquo;ineffable&rdquo;. So how can what is ineffable even be true,
and how can what is neither true nor false (nor as a result probably
true, much less certain), serve as the ultimate premises of <em>a
priori</em> valid logical probability relations licensing belief or
assertion with probability or credibility? And how can we anticipate
or predict future experience that isn&rsquo;t yet given, much less
elicit an inductive inference concerning it on reflection, except in
conceptual terms, at least comparatively, e.g. comparing future
experience to the way sugar usually looks or tastes? Again, there may
seem to be tension in Lewis&rsquo; views of the given and the
epistemic role he assigns it. Lewis (1936a and 1936b [1970,
155&ndash;7, 292&ndash;3]; 1946, 179&ndash;83) recognizes the logical
and epistemological problems, and he responds by introducing
categories of <em>expressive</em> statements and the
<em>expressive</em> use of language.</p>

<p>
Expressive statements like &ldquo;It seems as though I am seeing a red
round thing&rdquo; serve to convey or express or <em>denote</em> what
we directly apprehend in experience without conceptualizing and
interpreting it. They are true by virtue of the qualitative character
of experience they express and are verified by it (or don&rsquo;t need
verification), and false only when we knowingly lie about our
experience, and the ineffability of what they express just consists in
their not implying possibilities of further experience. Moreover,
their truth is something of which we are certain (Lewis 1946,
171&ndash;2, 183, 204, 327). The expressive use of language is to
convey or express what is not only directly apprehended but what may
be directly apprehensible in the future or, perhaps, was directly
apprehensible in the past. (Lewis 1946, 179). It borrows its terms
from the language used to express objectively conceptualized
interpretations of experience but not its use or the epistemic status
of its uses. (Firth (1964) in a commemorative symposium on Lewis
discusses some of these issues in relation to Sellars (1956 [1963]),
which led to continued correspondence.) Nonetheless, Lewis notes that
the expressive use of language is needed only for the discussion of
knowledge, not for knowledge itself (Lewis 1946, 183; 1952a [1970,
327]). So, perhaps it isn&rsquo;t surprising that he also talks of
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; as &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; standing &ldquo;in the
relation of premises to conclusion&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 326), of
&ldquo;immediately given facts of sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;facts of our
seeming to remember&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 327, 353) and of &ldquo;datum
facts&rdquo; and &ldquo;logical relations of facts&rdquo; (Lewis 1952a
[1970, 325]), suggesting that what the expressive use of language is
supposed to help convey are data facts (premises) and states of
affairs (conclusions), past and future, that are probable relative to
the data facts via logical relations. Yet that still seems to require
that in given experience, whether present sense experience or mnemonic
presentation, we are aware of such and such specific qualities, but
without conceptualizing them in ways that predict other experiences
and make them subject to revision.</p>

<p>
Sellars (1956 [1963, 132]) claimed that the classical empiricist given
was an inconsistent triad of three claims: (1) being appeared to as if
there were something red entails non-inferentially knowing that one is
appeared redly to, (2) the ability to be appeared to is unacquired,
and (3) the ability to know facts of the form x is F is acquired.
Lewis clearly denied (1), but he recognized this was the result of a
choice about how to use &ldquo;know&rdquo; and that others,
&ldquo;without fault&rdquo;, might choose to extend it to direct
apprehensions of sense because they are certain for us (Lewis 1946,
29&ndash;30, 188). However, if Lewis followed suit and granted (1), it
seems he would deny (3) on the grounds that the ability to be certain
of the given wasn&rsquo;t acquired. Sellars&rsquo; criticism of
classical empiricism goes well beyond this simple triad. For Sellars
(1954 [1963]; 1956 [1963, 161&ndash;70], 1953 [1963, 316&ndash;7]),
the content or meaning of states capable of being true and known to be
true depends on their inferential role in a normative, rule-governed,
reflectively self- critical practice that makes them subject to
correction. Their truth is a form of correctness in that practice
(Sellars 1968, 101). Sellars (1953 [1963, 310&ndash;11]) thought
Lewis&rsquo; talk of immediate awareness of universals fails these
constraints. Lewis&rsquo; defense of the certainty of the given rests
on two claims. First, it is just an undeniable fact, apparent to
anyone who reflects on experience, that there is a sensuous character
of experience which we are aware of and can&rsquo;t be mistaken about
and which, until it fades to memory, isn&rsquo;t subject to correction
and isn&rsquo;t further confirmable. As Lewis (1952a [1970, 329]) put
it in a symposium on the given with Reichenbach (1952) and Goodman
(1952), there is no requirement of &ldquo;inductive consistency&rdquo;
on expressive statements. Second, the supposition that probability is
always relative to something else that is itself only probable means
that probabilities can never get off the ground. As Lewis says,
&ldquo;if anything is to be probable, something must be certain&rdquo;
(Lewis 1946, 186). Goodman (1952) argued that the premises relative to
which other statements are credible or probable just have to be
initially credible on their own to some degree, not certain, though
subject to future confirmation or disconfirmation in the light of
further experience. So long as they are initially credible on their
own rather than because something else is initially credible,
Lewis&rsquo; regress fails. This is a view that attracted many
epistemologists after Lewis in some form or other.</p>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo; response is instructive for his understanding of
epistemology. For Lewis (1952a [1970, 330]), a principal task of
epistemology is with the &ldquo;validity&rdquo; of knowledge, i.e.,
with the justification or warrant for cognition that distinguishes
empirically warranted belief from lucky or unlucky guess or hazard of
belief. If a class of beliefs in principle may be false, we need some
reason or grounds for thinking its members true or likely to be true,
especially if we plan to base other beliefs on them. That requires
present or past justifying grounds of belief, not just future
potential for verification or confirmation as he thinks Goodman
proposes. Otherwise, we confuse justification with verification, or
ignore the former for the latter. (Might Goodman, like Chisholm
(1948), think Lewis had already opened the barn door by conceding that
our ostensible recollections are <em>prima facie</em> but
non-inductively probable in their own right?) Nor can the grounds
consist solely in other beliefs that might be mistaken without grounds
for thinking them true or likely to be true, or in beliefs that stand
in conditional probabilistic relations to each other, as he thinks
Reichenbach proposes, without any antecedent probabilities deriving
from something else (Lewis 1952a [1970, 328]). Lewis acknowledges that
his (somewhat traditional) concerns with validation or justification,
skepticism, and the need for given justifying grounds, lead him to
depart from or supplement standard pragmatic theories.</p>

<h2 id="LogLanMea">4. Logic, Language, and Meaning</h2>

<p>
In SSL Lewis (1918) surveyed and discussed developments in symbolic
logic from Leibniz to his own day and followed his discussion of
systems of material implication with a penultimate chapter presenting
his own system of strict implication (omitted from the 1960 Dover
reprint). In the concluding chapter (also omitted from the 1960 Dover
reprint), Lewis distinguished three possible types of &ldquo;logistic
procedure&rdquo; and resultant system (Lewis 1918, 354&ndash;62,
367&ndash;72). The first restricts proofs in mathematics to special
cases of the propositions of symbolic logic, but grants branches of
mathematics their own primitive or undefined ideas and postulates
distinct from those of symbolic logic. The second goes further,
reducing mathematics to symbolic logic by defining or analyzing the
ideas and postulates of the former in terms of those of the latter.
However, the third &ldquo;heterodox&rdquo; or &ldquo;external&rdquo;
conception of mathematics &ndash; &ldquo;mathematics without
meaning&rdquo; &ndash; treats mathematical and logical systems alike
as purely formal, abstract systems performing operations on
recognizable ideographic marks and strings of marks in ways that are
independent of what they denote or mean, or even the type of thing
they are interpreted as standing for, <em>e.g</em>. concept or
proposition, and thus independent of the truth of strings of marks.
What matters instead are simply the types of order and relation with
which recognizable marks or complexes of marks are distributed and
&ldquo;extra-logical&rdquo; rules or principles for manipulating them,
like the consistent substitution of marks for marks within a string of
marks. Post (1921) credited Lewis as the first to make substitution an
explicit rule for logic, whether under an orthodox conception as with
his system of strict implication (Lewis 1918, 295) between
propositions, or under a heterodox conception concerning recognizable
marks and their order (Lewis 1918, 355, 358), and cited Lewis&rsquo;
discussion of the heterodox conception as a stimulus for his own
formalist research.</p>

<p>
Lewis was dissatisfied with the extensional truth functional logic of
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, and with its understanding of
implication as material implication, according to which the truth of
the if-then conditional \(p \supset q\) expressing the material
implication of \(q\) by \(p\) is a function just of the truth or
falsity of \(p\) and \(q. p \supset q\) is equivalent to \({\sim}(p
\amp{\sim}q)\) and is true just in case it isn&rsquo;t the case both
that \(p\) is true and \(q\) is false. As a result, among the theses
of <em>Principia Mathematica</em> are \(p \supset(q \supset p)\) and
\({\sim}p \supset(p \supset q)\). In other words, a true proposition,
whatever it happens to be, is implied by any proposition whatsoever,
true or false, and a false proposition, whatever it happens to be,
implies any proposition whatsoever, true or false. Lewis didn&rsquo;t
deny these theses, properly understood relative to the definition of
material implication. However, he did think that these so-called
&ldquo;paradoxes of material implication&rdquo; meant that material
implication doesn&rsquo;t provide a proper understanding of any
ordinary notion of implication, according to which one proposition
implies another just in case the latter logically follows from and is
deducible from the former.</p>

<p>
To explicate this notion he defined strict implication, according to
which the if-then conditional \(p \fishhook q\) expressing the strict
implication of \(q\) by \(p\) is equivalent to \({\sim}\Diamond(p
\amp{\sim}q)\), and is true just in case it is not possible that \(p\)
is true and \(q\) is false. Strict implication is an intensional
notion, and the logic of strict implication is a form of modal logic.
The system of strict implication developed in SSL (Lewis 1918) was
distinguished from earlier modal logics by its axiomatic presentation
in the light of the work of Whitehead and Russell. However, Lewis
faced a number of criticisms, including one by Emil Post that one of
Lewis&rsquo; postulates led to the result that it was indeed
impossible that \(p\) just in case it was false that \(p\), so that
Lewis&rsquo; SSL system reduced to an extensional one. Lewis (Lewis
and Langford 1932) eliminated these problems in SL and provided
distinct systems of strict implication or modal logic, S1&ndash;S5,
each stronger than its predecessor (with S3 the system of SSL). S1
contained the following axioms:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
&amp; (p \amp q) \fishhook(q \amp p) \\
 &amp;(p \amp q) \fishhook p \\
 &amp;p \fishhook(p \amp p) \\
 &amp;((p \amp q) \amp r) \fishhook (p \amp(q \amp r)) \\
 &amp;((p \fishhook q) \amp(q \fishhook r)) \fishhook(p \fishhook r) \\
 &amp;(p \amp(p \fishhook q)) \fishhook q 
\end{align}\]

<p>
S2 adds to S1 the consistency postulate</p> 
\[ \Diamond(p \amp q) \fishhook \Diamond p, \]

<p>
which allows one to show that if \(p \fishhook q\) is a theorem, then
so is \({\sim}\Diamond{\sim}p \fishhook{\sim}\Diamond{\sim}q\), i.e.,
\(\Box p \fishhook \Box q\), expressing the strict implication of the
necessity of \(q\) by the necessity of \(p\). S3 adds to S1 the
postulate</p> 
\[ (p \fishhook q) \fishhook({\sim}\Diamond q \fishhook{\sim}\Diamond p) \]

<p>
S4 adds to S1 the iterative axiom:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
&amp;{\sim}\Diamond{\sim}p \fishhook{\sim}\Diamond{\sim}{\sim}\Diamond{\sim}p, \text{ i.e.,} \\
 &amp;\Box p \fishhook \Box \Box p 
\end{align}\]

<p>
S5 adds to S1 the iterative axiom:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
&amp;\Diamond p \fishhook{\sim}\Diamond{\sim}\Diamond p, \text{ i.e.,} \\
 &amp;\Diamond p \fishhook \Box \Diamond p 
\end{align}\]

<p>
Critics objected that strict implication posed its own alleged
paradoxes. Within Lewis&rsquo; systems S2&ndash;S5, a necessarily true
proposition is strictly implied by any proposition whatsoever, and a
necessarily false proposition strictly implies any proposition
whatsoever. However, Lewis (Lewis and Langford, 1932) replied in SL
that these alleged paradoxes are simply the result of entirely natural
assumptions about valid deductive inference and entailment quite apart
from the systems of strict implication, and thus are not a problem for
the claim that strict implication provides an explication of
deducibility and entailment. (The presentation in this and the
previous two paragraphs owes much to the excellent account and
discussion of Lewis&rsquo; systems of strict implication in Hughes and
Cresswell (1968, Chapters 12&ndash;13).)</p>

<p>
Lewis thought that there are an unlimited number of possible systems
of logic. One example is the extensional propositional calculus of
<em>Principia</em> according to which there are two truth values, true
and false; other examples are the various systems of many valued logic
that Lewis surveyed in SL, and, of course, Lewis&rsquo; own various
modal systems S1&ndash;S5. Lewis thought that each of these systems is
valid so long as it is internally consistent. The principles of the
various alternatives simply define the meaning of the logical concepts
and operators such as negation, truth/falsity, disjunction,
implication, and thus they are all true (Lewis 1932 [1970, 401]).
Bivalent systems simply have a different notion of truth and falsity
from non-bivalent ones. Nonetheless, some systems may accord better
than others with notions of truth or implication or deduction that are
implicit in our everyday reasoning. Logics can thus be assessed
pragmatically by their sufficiency for the guidance and testing of our
usual deductions, systematic simplicity and convenience, and accord
with our psychological limitations and mental habits. However, Lewis
denied that he was claiming that principles of logic could be true
without being necessarily true, or necessarily true without being
necessarily necessary. A logic in which \(\Box p \fishhook \Box \Box
p\) holds simply operates with a different notion of necessity from
one in which it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1943, 1946, Chps. 3&ndash;6) distinguished several modes of
meaning. The <em>denotation</em> of a term is the class of actual
things to which the term applies and is distinct from the
<em>comprehension</em> &mdash; the class of possible or consistently
thinkable things to which it applies. The <em>signification</em> of a
term is the property the presence of which in a thing makes the term
applicable, The term &ldquo;dog&rdquo; denotes the actual dogs but
<em>names</em> what it comprehends and the abstract term
&ldquo;dogness&rdquo; names what &ldquo;dog&rdquo; signifies. The
<em>intension</em> or <em>connotation</em> of a term is what is
applicable to any possible thing to which the term is applicable.
Intension can be linguistic intension, in which case it is the
conjunction of terms applicable to any possible thing to which the
term is applicable and thus substitutable for the term <em>salva
veritate</em>. However, since definitions must have criteria of
application and these must ultimately be non-circular, the more basic
dimension of intension for most terms is <em>sense meaning</em>. Sense
meaning is the criterion in mind in terms of sense experience for
classifying objects and applying a term&mdash;a schema or rule that
speakers have in mind whereby a term applies to an actual or thinkable
thing or signifies some property, and which would exist even if there
were no linguistic expression for it. What is essential to having a
&ldquo;criterion in mind&rdquo; is &ldquo;entertained in advance of
instances of application&rdquo;, which could in principle be construed
in terms of incipient behaviour and behavioural tendencies, but for
Lewis (1946, 144) it is just &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; that the
criteria are sensory and &ldquo;inwardly observable&rdquo;. A
<em>proposition</em> is a linguistic expression that is capable of
signifying a <em>state of affairs</em> and is the content of an
assertion (or question, assumption, hypothesis, etc.) Every
<em>statement</em> asserts a proposition and attributes a state of
affairs to the actual world. What every true proposition denotes as a
result is the actual world and what it comprehends is the set of
possible worlds. A <em>world</em> is such that one or the other of
every pair of contradictory propositions would apply or be true of it.
(Are there alternative logics in which the law of excluded middle
doesn&rsquo;t hold?) The intension of a proposition comprises
everything that the proposition entails and nothing else. The set of
conditionals about what experiences we would have, were we to have
other experience and act, that are entailed by a proposition
expressing our objective interpretation of experience thus comprises
for us the intension of the proposition, thanks to its sense meaning
(Lewis 1946, 136) not the verbal definitions of its terms. This
position has sometimes been called &ldquo;analytic
phenomenalism&rdquo; but not by Lewis. It does not straightforwardly
entail what the <em>denota</em> are, apart from satisfying the
criteria, or their ontological status (Lewis 1954 [1970, 333]). Lewis
(1929, 115, 121) says that terms denote the actual and possible
experiences that constitute the experiential criteria for the
application of the term, but in AKV Lewis (1946, 137) calls this a
&ldquo;confusion&rdquo; of intension with denotation. Nonetheless, the
sense meaning of a term is <em>coterminous</em> with its
comprehension. A term used by two individuals with different sense
meanings, or linguistic intensions of differing scientific
sophistication, might then presumably mostly overlap in denotation, or
even agree entirely, but not in comprehension.</p>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, 107) argued that verbal definition is eventually
circular and logical analysis not a reduction to primitive terms, but
a matter of relating terms to each other. Concepts consist in
relational structures of meaning and require criteria of application
in experience. The &ldquo;total meaning&rdquo; of a term for an
individual, Lewis (1929, 115) says, consists of the concept it
expresses and the sensory criteria for its application. However, the
sensory criteria needn&rsquo;t be identical across individuals, and
indeed are unlikely to be so given variations, potentially dramatic,
in experience between individuals. Nonetheless, there can be shared,
common, communicable, &ldquo;pure&rdquo; concepts in so far as there
are shared structures of linguistic definition and common or congruent
patterns of behavioural discrimination in particular co-operative
behaviour that both requires and fosters common concepts and that find
correlates in experience (Lewis, 115&ndash;6). Common concepts are an
&ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 115) from the actual
psychological states of individuals, implicit in their practice, and
their possibility is conditioned by two facts: we are creatures having
in large the same needs and interests and powers of discrimination and
relation, and are confronted by a common reality mediated to us in
sense experience which is comparable, if not identical (Lewis 1929,
91).</p>

<p>
One problem for Lewis&rsquo; view of common concepts was pointed out
by Quine (1960) in <em>Word and Object</em> with his indeterminacy of
translation argument. From the standpoint of an interpreter, there can
be alternative translation manuals or schemes that are consistent with
the total set of a speaker&rsquo;s verbal and other behavioural
dispositions. This is a problem that Lewis (1946, 144&ndash;5, 164)
seems aware of in AKV. There he draws back from the discussion of
common concepts, but not common meaning entirely, and rests content
with pointing out that any attribution of either linguistic meaning or
sense meaning to another is inductive and only probable, and any
attribution of linguistic or sense meaning similar to ours is likewise
inductive, fallible, and problematic. There is no special problem, he
thinks, concerning sense meaning.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1946, 84&ndash;5, 93&ndash;5) distinguished between
<em>analytic</em> and <em>synthetic</em> truth. Analytically true
statements are true by virtue of the definition of the terms they
contained, and have zero intension (and universal comprehension). They
are necessarily true, true in all possible worlds, no matter what else
might be true of a world or thing, and yet are not equivalent in
meaning to each other only due to the distinct intensions of their
constituents. <em>Explicitly analytic</em> statements
(&ldquo;Necessarily, cats are animals&rdquo;) assert the logically
necessity of a proposition; <em>implicitly analytic</em> ones
(&ldquo;Cats are animals&rdquo;) merely assert a proposition which is
analytic.(Lewis 1946, 89). The putative differences seem sharply
distinguished in Lewis&rsquo; semantics, but the application of the
distinctions to statements in practice less so.</p>

<p>
In MWO Lewis occasionally claimed that we create necessary truth by
adopting concepts and criterial principles; in AKV he was more
circumspect. It is a matter of convention or legislation that a term
has the meaning it does, including sense meaning, but Lewis (1946,
155&ndash;7) denied that analytic truth was truth by convention or
stipulation. &ldquo;A dog is an animal&rdquo; is analytically true by
virtue of the sense meaning of &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and
&ldquo;animal&rdquo;, in particular, the inclusion of the criterion
for applying the latter in the criterion for applying the former, and
that isn&rsquo;t a matter of convention. However, Lewis never tried to
define such inclusion further. Quine (1951) explicitly criticized
Lewis and the analytic/synthetic distinction and would have objected
to the idea of resting it on an undefined notion of meaning inclusion.
Lewis (1946, 154), on the other hand, thought that meaning inclusion
is as unproblematic and recognizable a fact as the inclusion of one
plan in another, e.g. a plan to visit France in a plan to visit Paris,
and didn&rsquo;t need further explication. Nonetheless, taking meaning
inclusion to be a primitive fact also makes it more difficult to
distinguish Lewis&rsquo; analytic necessity from the
rationalists&rsquo; synthetic necessity, despite his (Lewis 1946, 157)
vigorous rejection of the latter. This is especially so since Lewis
denied that analytic truth is usefully elucidated as one that is
reducible to logical truth with the substitution of definitions. For
Lewis (1946, 129&ndash;30, 122&ndash;24) , the adequacy of a
definition itself is a matter of analytic truth and a logical truth is
an analytically true formal statement &ldquo;certifiable&rdquo; from
its intension as constituted by the intension of its constituent
symbols and their syntax. </p>

<h2 id="PriAna">5. The <em>A Priori</em> and the Analytic</h2>

<p>
Lewis (1946, 29&ndash;31) thought that necessary truths are analytic
and knowable <em>a priori</em>, independently of experience. In
applying concepts like those of red or apple, as well as more abstract
concepts and categories, to current experience and interpreting it, we
form expectations and make predictions about future experience,
conditional on actions we might perform. Our beliefs constitute
empirical knowledge in so far as past experience gives us good reason
(largely inductive) for making these predictions. However, we
aren&rsquo;t making predictions about future experience simply in
stating what these concepts are, what their definitions are, and what
the criteria are for applying them to experience. Such statements are
explicative, not predictive, and so neither falsifiable by failed
prediction nor verifiable by successful prediction nor justified by
inductive evidence. The <em>a priori</em> is what we are not required
to abandon, no matter what experience may bring (Lewis 1929, 267).
However, <em>a priori</em> principles are neither principles that are
universal nor ones that we have to accept. The acceptance of a set of
concepts is a matter of decision or legislation or the adoption of an
intention to employ certain criteria in the interpretation of
experience, something for which there are alternatives but for which
the criteria are not empirical but pragmatic.</p>

<p>
In MWO, Lewis (1929, 254) thought that the <em>a priori</em> extended
to fundamental laws of nature defining basic concepts like mass or
energy or simultaneity, and thus included some of what are typically
regarded as the basic principles of a scientific theory, as well as
abstract mathematics and logic usually regarded as <em>a priori</em>.
Besides criteria like convenience and conformity to human bent,
pragmatic considerations mentioned in MWO (Lewis 1929, 267) include
factors like intellectual simplicity, economy, comprehensiveness, and
thus the overall achievement of intellectual order. However, unlike
many in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Lewis never
recognized such factors as criteria of empirical justification. The
reason seems to be that Lewis (1936b [1970, 286]) didn&rsquo;t think
that these factors make a hypothesis any more probable, in contrast,
presumably, to conformity to logical principles of inductive
inference: &ldquo;What such simplicity and convenience determine is
not truth or even probability but merely simplicity and
convenience&rdquo;. As a result, they are not criteria of
<em>epistemic</em> warrant or justification, concerned with the truth
or validity of what we believe (Lewis 1946, 441; 1955a, 34). Nor are
they criteria of <em>a priori</em> epistemic justification. The
simpler set of concepts and explicative principles is no more valid or
true than the simpler logic is more true or valid</p>

<p>
Pragmatic considerations might lead us in the face of experience to
abandon our scientific concepts and <em>a priori</em> principles
explicating them and adopt others without making the former any less
epistemically warranted. Repeated failure to apply a scientific
concept to experience might lead us to stop employing it to interpret
experience without disconfirming or making its explicative principles
any less epistemically warranted, and eventually lead us to drop them
altogether in favour of others that are more fruitful. In more
interesting cases, cruder categories may be replaced by more fine
grained ones that carve up experience in ways that are more valuable
for our purposes, or lead to inventions that open up the bounds of
experience in ways that our old principles can accommodate but in a
less simple or more <em>ad hoc</em> way than new ones and lead us to
abandon an old theory that can accommodate such experience but in a
less simple way than a novel one. Concepts or categories &ldquo;do not
literally change&rdquo; but are given up. Old <em>a priori</em> truths
are replaced by new ones, not contradicted by them and not made false
by them (Lewis 1929, 267&ndash;8). The terms might remain but their
meaning has changed.</p>

<p>
The most radical challenge to Lewis came from Quine (1951). He argued
that the distinction between so called <em>a priori</em> truths and
<em>a posteriori</em> truths is just one of degree. The argument has
two steps. First, empirical hypotheses have implications for
experience only in conjunction with various empirical generalizations
and other background assumptions, e.g. about the circumstances of
perception. Recalcitrant experience thus tells us only that some
belief or assumption in the total set that implies a contrary
experience is false, not which one, and thus any statement can be held
true, no matter what experience brings, so long as we make enough
adjustments to the rest of our beliefs and assumptions. Second,
empirical hypotheses can&rsquo;t logically imply anything about
experience except against a background of assumed laws of logic.
Recalcitrant experience can, in principle, then, lead us to revise an
assumed logical principle in our web of belief rather one of our other
beliefs. We may be reluctant to do so because of the relative
centrality of a logical principles to our system of belief and the
disruption its revision would cause, and so &ldquo;choose that
revision which requires the least alteration&rdquo; (Lewis 1936b
[1970, 283]), but in principle we could.</p>

<p>
With respect to the second step, some might object that logic is part
of the framework within which beliefs have logical implications and
can&rsquo;t be part of the same system of belief itself. However,
Lewis himself might have trouble with this suggestion, since he
recognized the possibility of alternative logics, and presumably, any
decision, even pragmatic, about the adoption or rejection of a logic
must operate on some logical assumptions. In any case, Lewis himself
recognizes that in principle experience could lead us to abandon
logical beliefs and replace them with others. What he will deny is
that it does so by making these principles empirically improbable.
With respect to the first step, Lewis (1948, 1952a [1970]), will deny
Quine&rsquo;s assumption that objective statements never entail
conditionals about experience on having other experiences without
supposing other objective statements true and deny his assumption that
the antecedents of these conditionals are never themselves certain.
Moreover, objective hypotheses, despite their various interconnections
in a system of empirical belief, aren&rsquo;t tested as a
&ldquo;block&rdquo;, but have separable and distinct probabilistic
connections to others (but not thereby to all) and to experience,
establishing differing antecedent probabilities and degrees of
confidence, in the light of which the relevance of tests for the
probability of the various hypotheses needs to be assessed
differentially (Lewis 1936b [1970, 285&ndash;6]; Lewis 1946,
349&ndash;52). So it is open to Lewis to argue also that the logical
principles relevant to the empirical testing of hypotheses
aren&rsquo;t tested or warranted as part of a block with those
hypotheses, but warranted differentially, in an <em>a priori</em>
way.</p>

<p>
However, this response highlights the need for Lewis to provide a
positive account of our <em>a priori</em> knowledge of principles
explicating our concepts and how we have it, not just a negative
account that simply contrasts it with empirical knowledge. That need
is also highlighted by the fact that Lewis thinks that we learn
empirical generalizations about objects by inductive inference from
other empirical knowledge and this presumably affects further
predictions Yet, presumably, our concepts and their sense meaning
aren&rsquo;t changing with every change to the predictions we are in a
position to make, without the distinction between the <em>a
priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> collapsing. In MWO, he says the
<em>a priori</em> is knowable by the reflective and critical
formulation of our own principles of classification, at least with
respect to meaning connections explicitly before the mind (Lewis 1929,
287&ndash;8) and in AKV that <em>a priori</em> truths are certifiable
by reference to meanings alone (and their relations like inclusion),
and tested simply by what we can think or imagine being so (Lewis
1946, 35, 94&ndash;5, 151&ndash;3). However, the only explanation he
gives of why this should warrant us in thinking anything necessary or
possible is that &ldquo;as what we intend at the moment at least, a
meaning seems to be as open to direct examination as anything we are
likely to discover&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 145). It is this that warrants
us in dismissing an apparent Euclidean triangle the sum of whose
angles isn&rsquo;t 180 degrees as either a mismeasurement or not a
Euclidean triangle rather than a counterexample to Euclidean geometry.
There seems to be a half-acknowledged, non-inductive, basic principle
of <em>a priori</em> credibility assumed here, to the effect that if
on reflection on our concepts and meanings and classificatory
intentions, we think A includes B, then we are at least <em>prima
facie</em> warranted in thinking A does include B. As we saw with
memory, Lewis isn&rsquo;t in principle averse to non-inductively
supported principles of <em>prima facie</em> warrant.</p>

<p>
However, <em>prima facie</em> warrant is fallible and defeasible. We
may fail to recognize what is implicit in our concepts and what their
adoption consistently commits us to in our thinking. Any of these
mistakes, Lewis (1946, 155) says, is &ldquo;intrinsically possible of
correction merely by taking thought of the matter&rdquo;, without
empirical investigation. The correctness of explicative principles can
be warranted <em>a priori</em> in so far as their truth can be
certified or assured simply by analysis of meanings or reflection on
the content of our concepts and explicative principles. (Lewis 1946,
151, 165). Yet, suppose we recognize <em>a posteriori</em> through
empirical investigation of our classificatory verbal behaviour that it
doesn&rsquo;t accord with what it should be in the light of our <em>a
priori</em> reflection on our concepts and explicative principles?
Does that give us empirical grounds for some doubt about the latter,
rendering it at least somewhat less warranted, at least for the time
being, even if the response should be further reflection on our
concepts and classificatory intentions, as Lewis says? In any case, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be grounds for rejecting the distinction altogether
between <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> warrant. It would
be grounds, however, for denying that unrevisability of degree of
warrant in the light of empirical evidence is a defining criterion of
the <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<h2 id="EmpKnoPro">6. Empirical Knowledge and Probability</h2>

<p>
In AKV, Lewis distinguished three classes of empirical statements.
First, there are <em>expressive</em> statements formulating what is
presently given in experience and about the truth of which we can be
certain (Lewis 1946, 171&ndash;71, 183, 204, 327). Second, there are
<em>terminating</em> judgements and statements formulating and
predicting what we would experience were we to be presented with some
sensory cue and perform some action. The form of terminating
judgements is (Lewis 1946, 184, 205, 250):</p>

<blockquote>
If (or given) \(S\), then if \(A\), it would be the case that \(E\),
i.e. \(((S \amp A) \rightarrow E)\)
</blockquote>

<p>
where \(S, A\), and \(E\) are each formulated in expressive language
and concern particular presentable experiences about which we can be
certain, and &ldquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rdquo; is neither logical
entailment nor material implication but what Lewis calls &ldquo;real
connection&rdquo; giving rise to subjunctive or counterfactual
conditionals. Real connections (including causal connections) are
inductively established correlations by virtue of which one observable
item may indicate another. The subjunctive \((S \amp A) \rightarrow
E\) is &ldquo;implicitly general&rdquo; (Lewis, 1946, 219) and may be
decisively falsifiable but is not decisively verifiable (though Lewis
sometimes suggests otherwise). Third, there are
<em>non-terminating</em> judgements, including <em>objective</em>
judgment, that are confirmable and disconfirmable by experience,
thanks to their sense meaning, but are neither decisively verifiable
nor decisively falsifiable.</p>

<p>
Objective judgements include not only perceptual judgements like
&ldquo;There is a white piece of paper before me&rdquo; in which we
conceptualize and interpret a given experience by relating it to other
possible experiences, but also a vast number of other beliefs about
the material world supported by our perceptual beliefs, e.g.
statements about the future outcome of space explorations, or
generalizations like &ldquo;All men have noses&rdquo;, or non-analytic
statements about theoretical entities. Objective judgements
don&rsquo;t strictly imply terminating judgements of the form \((S
\amp A) \rightarrow E\) (Lewis 1946, 237). Instead, the sense meaning
of objective judgments consists of an indefinitely large set of
general probabilistically qualified conditional judgements of the form
&ldquo;If it were the case that \(S \amp A\), then, in all likelihood,
\(E\)&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 237). Any objective perceptual judgement
\(P\) thus analytically entails and is entailed by, an indefinitely
large set of hypothetical or conditional judgements of the form,</p>

<blockquote>
\((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\),
<br />
where \((h)E\) means that, in all probability \(E\), and expresses,
not the probability of the conditional \((S \amp A) \rightarrow E)\),
but &ldquo;a relation of probability&rdquo; between \(E, S\), and
\(A\) (Lewis 1946, 250).
</blockquote>

<p>
Lewis also calls these conditional judgements terminating judgements,
but they are neither decisively verifiable nor decisively falsifiable.
Nonetheless, as expressing real connections, they are confirmable and
disconfirmable by experience, as are the objective judgements whose
sense meaning they constitute.</p>

<p>
For example, to use Lewis&rsquo;s examples, suppose \(P\) is &ldquo;a
sheet of paper lies before me&rdquo;. Its analytic entailments might
include, &ldquo;If \(S_1\) (I were to seem to see a sheet of paper
before me) and \(A_1\) (I were to seem to move my eyes), then,
probably, \(E_1\) (I would seem to see the sheet of paper
displaced)&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;If \(S_2\) (I were to seem to
feel paper with my fingers), and \(A_2\) (I were to seem to pick it up
and tear it), then, probably, \(E_2\) (I would seem to see or feel
torn paper)&rdquo;, and so on. On the other hand, suppose \(P\) is
&ldquo;There is a doorknob before me&rdquo;. Its truth might then
entail the truth of a complex set of conditionals like &ldquo;If I
were to seem to see a doorknob, and were to seem to reach out towards
it and grasp it, then, probably, I would seem to feel something hard
and round&rdquo;, etc.</p>

<p>
In MWO Lewis says in one place that not only are appearances
physically conditioned by objects and the physical circumstances of
one&rsquo;s body and perception, which is certainly a reason for
wanting to know such physical facts, but that these conditions enter
into the basic understanding or meaning of material object statements:
&ldquo;It is such conditions which are expressed in the
&lsquo;if&rsquo; clause of those &lsquo;If &hellip; then
&hellip;&rsquo; propositions in which the predictions implicit in an
interpretation may be made explicit&rdquo; (Lewis 1929, 286). Now,
Lewis might here simply be recognizing that, according to MWO (before
the introduction of the category of expressive language), any attempt
to make the conditional explicit in linguistic form as a proposition
will result in both the antecedent and consequent being linguistically
expressed propositions and thus expressed in the language of objective
interpretation. However, he seems to be making a stronger point
(albeit contrary to Lewis [1929, 336]). If so, it is a point which he
explicitly rejects in AKV: &ldquo;Thus those conditions which are
directly pertinent to a confirmation and genuinely ascertainable are
not objective facts but must be included amongst the given
appearances. They must be items of direct presentation; and we might
think of them as already covered by &lsquo;\(S\)&rsquo; in our
paradigm: \(S\) being given, if \(A\) then, with probability \(M,
E\)&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 246). The result is that \(S\) in Lewis&rsquo;
paradigm strictly speaking won&rsquo;t just stand for the visual
presentation of a doorknob, for example, but the appearance of
daylight or the feeling of being clear headed as part of the whole
presentation. It will stand for a &ldquo;complex of sense
qualia&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
No number of successful or failed tests will render the objective
judgement true or false with theoretical certainty. However, Lewis
thought the principle of inverse probabilities meant that the
judgement can be highly probable with a few positive confirmations,
even practically certain, in so far as the probability of \(P\)
increases and approaches certainty when \(S\) and \(A\) and \(E\) are
true, in the degree that \(E\) would be improbable were \(P\) false
and \(S\) and \(A\) were true, or, more generally, in so far as the
probability of \(P\) increases on supporting evidence to the extent
that the latter would be unlikely were \(P\) false (Lewis 1946,
190&ndash;2, 240&ndash;1). The principle also explains why further
tests may continue to increase our warranted assurance in the
judgement even more, though not as dramatically as earlier tests
increased our warrant (Lewis 1946, 191, fn. 4). Since confirming and
gaining assurance that \(P\) gives us assurance in all the predictions
\(P\) entails about future experience (Lewis 1946, 239; 1954 [1970],
334), the principle of inverse probabilities may explain how we can
act on these predictions with increasing confidence. As a result,
although experience of instances of \(S\) and \(A\) and \(E\) can
confirm and increase the probability of one sensory conditional
entailed by \(P\) independent of direct experiential confirmation of
the other sensory conditionals entailed by \(P\), experiential
confirmation of one conditional also increases the probability of the
others, and <em>vice versa</em> (Lewis 1946, 348 fn. 6; 1954 [1970],
334).</p>

<p>
Our empirical knowledge of objects and objective events and
properties, the generalizations they support concerning patterns of
objective events and properties, and the use we make of all this for
further inductions, has a complex &ldquo;many-storied
character&rdquo;. Nonetheless, the &ldquo;whole edifice still rests at
bottom on these primitive generalizations which we make in terms of
direct experience&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 261). (Lewis [1929, 332; 1946,
261] contrasted these primitive generalizations that underlie our
objective beliefs with what he says we normally call &ldquo;empirical
generalizations&rdquo; that concern patterns of objective events and
may formulate natural laws supporting causal explanations.) However,
the empirical justification for these primitive generalizations and
ultimately for our objective beliefs can&rsquo;t rest on current sense
experience alone and requires evidence concerning the past. At the
same time, what is given to us isn&rsquo;t the past itself about which
we can never be certain, but just current sense presentation and
current recollection or sense of past experience.</p>

<p>
Lewis appreciated the problem memory posed for his epistemology much
more clearly in AKV than in MWO. In AKV, Lewis (1946, 334) argued that
whatever we ostensibly remember, whether as explicit recollection or
merely in our sense of the past, is <em>prima facie</em> credible just
because so remembered. So there are data of sense presentation and
also data of &ldquo;seeming to remember&rdquo; or &ldquo;present
memory&rdquo; or &ldquo;mnemic presentation&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 353,
354) that constitute our ultimate evidence. It is only through the
latter and the principle of memorial <em>prima facie</em> credibility
that empirical generalizations and the beliefs they support can be
inductively supported by premises about past experience as well as by
premises about directly apprehended present experience. Further the
credibility of our recollections, together with the whole range of
empirical beliefs more or less dependent on them, can be solidified
and increased through the mutual support or congruence of the whole,
or can be diminished through incongruence.</p>

<p>
A set of beliefs is <em>congruent</em> for Lewis (1946, 338) when the
antecedent probability of each is increased by the assumption of the
truth of the rest. A physical object statement \(P\) and the set of
sensory conditionals that constitute its content form a congruent set,
as we have seen. Indeed, by virtue of exhausting the empirical content
of \(P\), Lewis (1946, 348&ndash;9, fn. 6; 1954 [1970, 334]) thinks
the sensory conditionals constitute a congruent set by themselves. In
any case, the degree of warrant enjoyed by the various elements of a
mature system of empirical belief about our world, especially one that
counts as <em>knowledge</em>, depends on the inferential support the
elements provide each other and the total empirical and memorial data
present. However, Lewis emphasizes that for the members of a congruent
system to have any degree of probability, &ldquo;it is absolutely
requisite that some at least of the set of statements possess a degree
of credibility antecedent to and independent of the remainder of those
in question, and derivable from the relation of them to direct
experience&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 339).</p>

<p>
As a result, the &ldquo;whole intricate network&rdquo; of the
empirically credible, Lewis notes, &ldquo;will be constituted at
bottom by linkages of ground and consequence, which is in general a
one way relation&rdquo; (Lewis 1946, 351). Disentangling the network
would reveal particular linkages of <em>prior</em> probability
relationships that would confer some degree of initial probability not
just on what we recall of past experience but on simple
generalizations from past experience and the expectations of future
experiences and thus interpretations of experience these recollections
inductively support, even in the hypothetical absence of objective
beliefs with which they are congruent (Lewis, 1929, 332, 336, Lewis
1946, 335). Moreover, the recollections that support them and form
part of an overall congruent system must have some degree of
credibility independent of each other and the rest. The improbability
of independently probable congruent recollections all being true were
the beliefs they inferentially support and that inferentially support
them not true makes it unlikely that they are illusions of memory and
increases the initial probability enjoyed antecedently by the
recollections and what they support (Lewis 1946, 352&ndash;3).
Spelling out the antecedent and independent probability constraints is
tricky and receives an extended discussion (Lewis 1946,
332&ndash;57).</p>

<p>
The <em>prima facie</em> credibility of mnemic presentation of past
experience can&rsquo;t itself be justified inductively for Lewis, on
pain of circularity. Nor did he think it is simply a postulate we have
to assume for empirical knowledge to be possible. Instead, he argued
that it is constitutive of the lived world of experience and something
for which there is no meaningful alternative. Sceptical alternatives
designed to undermine it are inaccessible to knowledge and thus ones
for which there is no criterion in experience. So it is an
&ldquo;analytic statement&rdquo; that the past is knowable, and a
similar claim was made for the relevance of past experience to the
future, and thus for the knowability of empirical reality. The
philosophical problem for Lewis (1946, 360&ndash;2) is to formulate
correctly the criteria that &ldquo;delimit empirical reality and
explicate our sense of it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In MWO, he defended induction in more detail by arguing that not every
prediction is compatible with an evidence base, and that successive
revision of one&rsquo;s predictions in the light of new experience
can&rsquo;t help but make for more successful predictions (Lewis 1929,
367, 386). Goodman&rsquo;s (1955) well known &ldquo;grue&rdquo;
example and his New Riddle of Induction pose problems for the
relevance of the first claim and the force of the second. At other
times, Lewis (1946, 325) simply followed Reichenbach in claiming that
we can be assured only that if any procedures will achieve success in
prediction, inductive ones will, without clearly distinguishing that
claim from any attempt at an analytic justification of induction.</p>

<p>
Rationally credible or warranted or justified belief, Lewis thought,
is probable on the evidence, but the presentation of his views on
probability was underdeveloped in MWO, and complex, and sometimes
confusing, in AKV. In AKV, Lewis defended an <em>a priori</em> account
of probability or what he sometimes called <em>expectation</em>.
However, citing Peirce, he rejected the Principle of Indifference
often associated with <em>a priori</em> accounts, understood as the
principle that in the absence of any reason for thinking one <em>a
priori</em> possibility more likely than another, they are
equiprobable (Lewis 1946, 306&ndash;314). The expectation or
probability \(a/b\) of a proposition \(P\) is always relative to some
set of empirical data or premises \(D\). The expectation corresponds
to an <em>a priori</em> valid estimate of the frequency of some
property mentioned in \(P\) in some reference class mentioned in \(P\)
, which estimate is derived from data or premises \(D\), given the
<em>a priori</em> valid principles of probabilistic inference,
including the principles of induction. Hypothetical or conditional
probability statements that are <em>a priori</em> valid license valid
probabilistic inferences from premises about evidence or data to
conclusions. However, for Lewis, both hypothetical and categorical
probability are always relativized to an evidence base, despite his
occasional apparent talk of <em>a priori</em> valid probability
statements as licensing inferences from empirical evidence to a
(detachable) conclusion &ldquo;Probably, \(P\)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1946, 282&ndash;90) rejected the view that probabilities are
empirically based estimates of the limiting value of the frequency of
instances of a property in a population, and thus expressed in
non-terminating judgments. First, he thought that any attempt to
define probability as the ratio of instances of one property among
instances of another property as the latter approaches infinity would
make probability judgments empirically untestable. Second, he argued
that, if probability judgements were empirical frequency claims, then
the probability judgements would themselves only be probable,
something that can&rsquo;t be coherently accounted for. Nonetheless,
Lewis recognized the need to assure ourselves rationally that the
frequency as validly estimated from the data is closely in accord with
the actual frequency and that there is nothing in the case at hand
affecting the occurrence of the property which isn&rsquo;t taken into
account in the specification of the reference class. Lewis dubbed this
the <em>reliability</em> of the determination of probability or
expectation. He thought that reliability is a function of the
<em>adequacy</em> of data (e.g. size of sample), the
<em>uniformity</em> with which the frequency of some property in the
data as a whole also holds for subsets of the data, and the
<em>proximateness</em> or degree of resemblance of the case at hand in
\(P\) to the data, all of which he thought are also logical
relations.</p>

<p>
Thus, in AKV, Lewis (1946, 305) claimed that the full statement of a
probability judgement should be of the form &ldquo;That \(c\), having
property \(F\), will also have property \(G\), is credible on data
\(D\), with expectation \(a/b\) and reliability \(R\)&rdquo;, and is
assertable in whatever sense \(D\) is. The judgement is valid when, in
accordance with the <em>a priori</em> rules of probability and the
correct rules of judging reliability, \(D\) gives the estimate \(a/b\)
of the frequency of \(F\)s among \(G\)s, and \(D\)&rsquo;s adequacy,
uniformity, and proximateness to the case in point, yields reliability
\(R\). A valid probability judgement is true when \(D\) is true, and
is a categorical rather than a hypothetical judgement when \(D\) is
categorically asserted as true. The assertion of the empirical data
\(D\) is the only empirical element in the probability judgement,
which otherwise has no testable implications for experience. However,
the belief \(P\), that \(c\) which has \(F\) is also \(G\), is an
empirical belief that may be rationally credible, empirically
justified or warranted, in so far as \(D\) is given and the degree of
assurance or belief corresponds to an <em>a priori</em> degree of
probability (expectation) of \(P\) on \(D\) that is sufficiently high
and sufficiently reliable. Further, acceptance of \(P\) counts as
empirical <em>knowledge</em> in so far as, first, \(P\) is true,
second the degree of probability or expectation of \(P\) on \(D\) is
sufficiently high as to approach practical certainty, and, third,
\(D\) consists of all relevant data (Lewis 1946, 314&ndash;15).</p>

<p>
It is important to distinguish probabilistically qualified
counterfactual statements of the form \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\)
from <em>a priori</em> probability statements of the form
\(\text{Prob}(E, \text{ given } S \amp A) \gt .5\). Both express
conditional probabilities. However, the former express
&lsquo;real&rsquo; connections knowable by induction from past
experience (Lewis 1946, 250). They constitute the analytically
entailed consequences of an objective material objective statement
\(P\), but can&rsquo;t themselves be analytic truths. The latter, on
the other hand, if true, are analytically true, knowable <em>a
priori</em>, with zero intension, and entailed by any statement
whatsoever, and so can hardly constitute the empirical meaning of
contingently true material object statements. Yet, apart from denying
that &ldquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rdquo; can be understood either as
material implication or strict implication, Lewis had little to say in
print about what the truth conditions of subjunctive or counterfactual
conditionals are. Murphey (2005, 332) quotes correspondence from
Lewis, in which he complains that Goodman and Chisholm in their
writings miss the obvious interpretation of &ldquo;If \(A\) were the
case, then \(B\) would be the case&rdquo;, namely that \(A\) plus
other premises of the (actual or hypothetical) case inductively
justify the conclusion \(B\). Lewis needs to say more then about what,
if anything, distinguishes \((S \amp A) \rightarrow E\) from \((S \amp
A) \rightarrow (h)E\). Is it the degree of probability of \(E\) on the
premises, practically certain in the former case, only somewhat
probable in the latter? Another problem is to interpret the remark so
as to avoid turning counterfactuals into <em>a priori</em> analytic
truths, albeit ones concerning probabilities. Nonetheless, Lewis
emphasized their importance, and the importance of the real
connections they express, for the possibility of realism about the
material world and the rejection of any sort of idealism or view that
physical objects are simply mind-dependent collections of experiences
(Lewis 1946, 226). The counterfactual sensory conditionals \((S \amp
A) \rightarrow E\) and \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\) can be true
quite apart from the truth of the expressive statements \(S\) and
\(A\), and thus so can material object statements.</p>

<p>
Chisholm (1948) raised an important objection to Lewis&rsquo; claim
that a physical object statement \(P\) entails a set of counterfactual
statements expressing claims about what experiences one would have or
would be likely to have were one to (seem to) carry out certain tests
upon being presented with certain sensory cues. If \(P\) entails
\(T\), then for any \(Q\) consistent with \(P\), \(P\) and \(Q\) also
entail \(T\). However, Chisholm argued, for any material object
statement \(P\) and for any sensory conditional \((S \amp A)
\rightarrow (h)E\), there will be some other material object statement
\(M\) about the circumstances of perception that is consistent with
\(P\), such that \(P\) and \(M\) can both be true while \((S \amp A)
\rightarrow (h)E\) is false. (Chisholm oversimplifies his objection by
leaving out the probabilistic qualifier in the counterfactual, but I
correct this.) For example, suppose \(P\) is &ldquo;There is a
doorknob before one&rdquo; and \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\) is
&ldquo;If one were to seem to see a doorknob and have the experience
of reaching out with one&rsquo;s hand, then, in all likelihood, one
would seem to feel something hard and round&rdquo;, and \(M\) is
&ldquo;One&rsquo;s fingers have been permanently anaesthetized&rdquo;.
(Expanding the understanding of \(S\) to include sensory correlates of
circumstances of perception, as Lewis (1946, 245&ndash;6) suggests,
presumably just requires expanding the understanding of \(M\) with
some imagination.) A material object statement like \(P\), therefore,
doesn&rsquo;t entail sensory conditionals like \((S \amp A)
\rightarrow(h)E\) . Instead of Lewis&rsquo; empiricism about the
meaning and justification of material object statements, Chisholm
proposed that our spontaneous perceptual beliefs about the world, e.g.
that one is seeing a doorknob, are <em>prima facie</em> justified just
by virtue of being such spontaneous perceptual beliefs, quite apart
from any inductive justification from present and past experience that
might be reconstructed. Lewis&rsquo; own defence of the <em>prima
facie</em> credibility of memory, Chisholm thought, prepared the way
for his alternative. Quine (1969), on the other hand, thought that
Chisholm&rsquo;s problem just shows that what have consequences for
experience and are tested by experience are never individual material
object statements in isolation from each other but only sets of them
or theories. Quine saved empiricism by drawing a holistic moral from
the sort of problem Chisholm posed.</p>

<p>
In a rare reply to critics, Lewis (1948a [1970, 322&ndash;3]) objected
that Chisholm had misunderstood the implication of the probability
qualifier. The familiar rule &ldquo;If \(P\) entails \(T\), then for
any \(Q\) consistent with \(P\), \(P\) and \(Q\) entail \(T\)&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t apply, he claims, when \(T\) is any kind of probability
statement. \(E\) not being probable on \(P\) and \(M\) and \(S\) and
\(A\) is perfectly consistent with \(E\) being probable on \(P\) and
\(S\) and \(A\) and its truth doesn&rsquo;t undermine the truth of the
claim that \(P\) entails \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\). However,
Chisholm might respond that the familiar rule is simply a consequence
of the meaning of entailment or strict implication, according to which
it is not possible that \(P\) and not \(T\). Moreover, Lewis
isn&rsquo;t simply claiming that \(E\) is probable on \(P\) and \(S\)
and \(A\), but, as Lewis (1946, 248&ndash;50) himself says in his
formal summary of his view, that the subjunctive conditional \((S \amp
A) \rightarrow(h)E\) is an <em>analytic consequence</em> of \(P\), at
least in the way \(X\) <em>is coloured</em> is a consequence of \(X\)
<em>is red</em>, and is (strictly) implied by \(P\), as a conclusion
to a premise, even if not solely by reference to the &ldquo;rules of
deductive logic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
(Of course, &ldquo;\(P\) strictly implies \(((S \amp A)
\rightarrow(h)E)\)&rdquo; itself strictly implies &ldquo;\((P \amp S
\amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\)&rdquo; (but not conversely), and neither is
contradicted by &ldquo;\((P \amp S \amp A \amp M) \rightarrow\)
not\((h)E\)&rdquo;. However, \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\) expresses
in its own right an &ldquo;in all likelihood&rdquo; relation of
probability between \(E\) and the possibly counterfactual \(S\) and
\(A\) (Lewis 1946, 250), quite apart from \(P\), a relation that, for
Lewis, holds when it is in accord with the <em>a priori</em> rules of
probability (including inductive inference) relative to the empirical
data D (Lewis 1946, 305, 314), in the simplest case, recollections of
past instances of \(E\) usually following \(S\) and \(A\).)</p>

<p>
Chisholm&rsquo;s challenge seems to remain, whether it is possible for
both:</p>

<p class="indent">
\(P\) = There is a doorknob before one.
<br />
\(M\) = One&rsquo;s fingers have been permanently anaesthetized. </p>

<p>
to be true and:</p>

<blockquote>

<table class="vert-top">
<tr>
  <td>\((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\)</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>If one were to seem to see a doorknob and have the experience of
reaching out with one&rsquo;s hand, then, in all likelihood, one would
seem to feel something and round.</td> </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
to be false. However, Lewis (1948a) also gives a second, less clear
cut, but perhaps more promising, response: when we break down the
possible scenarios in Chisholm&rsquo;s counterexample in detail, the
challenge fails. First, in normal cases where \(M\),
&ldquo;One&rsquo;s fingers have been permanently anaesthetized&rdquo;
manifests itself by affecting the sensory cues and making \(S_1\)
&ldquo;one seems to have tingly, numb fingers&rdquo; true, in addition
to \(S\) &ldquo;one seems to see a doorknob&rdquo;, \((S \amp S_1 \amp
A) \rightarrow\) not \((h)E\) might indeed be true, but, as Lewis
emphasizes, it is consistent with \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\).
Second, in other scenarios where the truth of \(M\) somehow
doesn&rsquo;t affect the sensory cues and is recent enough to have not
(yet) significantly altered the patterns in the data D, e.g. of
instances of \(E\) usually following \(S\) and \(A, (S \amp A)
\rightarrow(h)E\) remains true when \(P\) and \(M\) are true.
That&rsquo;s because in such cases \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\) is
still supported by the extant data of experience and memory D in
accord with the <em>a priori</em> rules, despite the truth of \(M\).
Further, the reliability of that probability assessment is still
warranted by the data and rules for judging reliability, although
\(M\) might affect the actual reliability of the probability
assessment in the cases at hand, and might eventually affect the
actual frequency of \(E\) over time. Of course, there may be
occasional failures, but, as Lewis notes, the probabilistically
qualified subjunctive \((S \amp A) \rightarrow (h)E\) is compatible
with occasional failures of prediction. (Much depends here on
Lewis&rsquo; own questionable understanding of probability and
counterfactuals. ) Finally, there are yet different (and more bizarre)
cases where the longstanding truth of \(M\) when \(P\) was true in the
past didn&rsquo;t affect the sensory cues but significantly affected
the pattern with \(E\), making D1, e.g. \(E\) not usually following
\(S\) and \(A\) in recalled instances, the actual empirical data,
rather than D as in the second case. However, in these scenarios it
seems that D1 wouldn&rsquo;t have led us to expect \(E\) upon \(S\)
and \(A\). Yet, that expectation is constitutive in part of our
objective thought \(P\), and thus, as Firth (1950) suggests, the
failure of the sensory conditional \((S \amp A) \rightarrow(h)E\) to
hold relative to D1 is arguably irrelevant to its entailment by the
thought we express by &ldquo;P&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In any case, one might wonder how sensory conditionals like \((S \amp
A) \rightarrow (h)E\), which for Lewis express generalizations
concerning what any one would (likely) experience and which must do so
if they are to provide the empirical content of objective judgements
about an interpersonal material world, can nonetheless be warranted
inductively by premises concerning only patterns in the personal
experience of the putative knower, in particular how their probability
can be judged to be sufficiently reliable, without reference to any
background beliefs about how the material world interacts with persons
generally and their bodies to affect experience. (Sellars (1959 [1963,
180&ndash;84]) makes a stronger claim: without such reference we
can&rsquo;t even understand the notion of the possible experience of
other persons. Lewis might think that empathy and imagination allow us
to.)</p>

<p>
Yet, if Lewis were simply to drop the analytic entailment claim that
gives probabilistically qualified sensory conditionals like \((S \amp
A) \rightarrow(h)E\) a privileged semantic role, and rest content with
the various consistent probability statements relating \(E\) to \(P\),
\(S\), \(A\), and \(M\), the character of his empiricism would become
puzzling. If the consistent relative probability statements in
question are the probabilistically qualified subjunctive conditionals,
\((P \amp S \amp A \rightarrow(h)E\) and \((P \amp S \amp A \amp M)
\rightarrow \text{not}(h)E)\) , then the statements in question are
empirical propositions justified by induction. The justification for
them thus will presuppose prior knowledge of the truth of material
object statements like \(P\) and \(M\), perhaps in the way Chisholm
suggests, rather than explain why and how we can know such
propositions solely on the basis of present and past experience of the
given. On the other hand, if the relative probability statements are
<em>a priori</em> analytic statements in their own right, then it is
the total set of such statements that will constitute the empirical
meaning of \(P\), statements like</p> 
\[ \text{Prob}(E, \text{ given } P \amp S \amp A \amp M) \lt .5 \]

<p>
as much as</p> 
\[ \text{Prob}(E, \text{ given } P \amp S \amp A) \gt .5 \]

<p>
thus containing other material object statements like \(M\). Even when
the relativization to other background material object statements
isn&rsquo;t explicit, the probability statement would seem to be
implicitly relative to some background assumption of material
normality. In other words, Lewis would have abandoned reductionism for
Quine&rsquo;s holistic conclusion that individual material object
statements like \(P\), apart from other material object statements,
have &ldquo;no fund of experiential implications to call their
own&rdquo; (Quine 1969, 79).</p>

<p>
As noted earlier, Lewis (1929, 286) (and also Lewis (1936b [1970,
285&ndash;6]), though there he may simply be alluding to the role of
congruence) flirts with a version of Quine&rsquo;s alternative.
However, in AKV and in his reply to Chisholm, Lewis clearly repudiates
it: if Chisholm were right that &ldquo;no statement of objective fact
had consequences for direct experience without further premises
specifying objective conditions of perception&rdquo;, then, Lewis
says, &ldquo;the type of empiricism of which my account is one
variant&mdash;verification-theories and
confirmation-theories&mdash;will be altogether indefensible&rdquo;
(Lewis 1948a [1970, 318]). The result, he adds, would be a fatally
flawed &ldquo;coherence theory of empirical truth&rdquo; that leaves
us with &ldquo;nothing..but skepticism&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="ValImp">7. Values and Imperatives</h2>

<p>
In contrast with those logical positivists who thought that statements
of value merely express attitudes, <em>pro</em> or <em>con</em>, to
objects, persons, or situations, but are neither true nor false, Lewis
(1946, 396&ndash;98) thought that statements of value were as true or
false as other empirical statements, and every bit as confirmable or
disconfirmable. Directly or immediately felt value, felt goodness and
badness, is given to us in directly prized experience and directly
apprehended in experience or stretches of experience, not so much as
one specific, separable <em>quale</em> of experience like the pitch of
middle C, but as a gamut of such and as a mode pervasive in all
experience, and <em>expressive</em> statements must be used to
indicate or convey it (Lewis 1946, 398, 401). However, such
statements, like Lewis&rsquo; other expressive statements, may be true
or false for Lewis, and simply convey the occurrence of given
<em>qualia</em> in experience and no more, instead of indicating the
existence of objects, situations, or persons, and expressing our
attitudes to them. Moreover, there are also for Lewis terminating
judgments of value concerning what some experiences, perhaps including
their felt value, indicate about the felt value of further
experiences. Finally, there are &ldquo;objective&rdquo; judgements of
value, judgements attributing value to persons, objects, and objective
situations, in so far as they have the potential, depending on
circumstances, to produce felt goodness or badness in us or others.
These are non-terminating judgements of value and are empirically
confirmable or disconfirmable by induction just like any other
objective empirical judgement. Lewis thus claims that his theory of
value is thoroughly naturalistic and humanistic, rather than
transcendental, but still objectivist.</p>

<p>
The felt goodness of experience is what is <em>intrinsically</em> good
or valuable for its own sake. It is only experience in so far as it
has such value quality that is intrinsically good rather than merely
extrinsically valuable for its contribution to something else that is
intrinsically valuable. Value and disvalue are modes or aspects of
experience to which desire and aversion are &ldquo;addressed&rdquo;
(Lewis 1946, 403). Lewis denies that &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; is
adequate to the wide variety of what is found directly good in
experience, and thus thinks it inadequate as a synonym for
&ldquo;good&rdquo;. However, as Frankena (1964) argues, for Lewis
directly found goodness still seems to be as natural a quality or
property of certain experiences as any other <em>qualia</em> directly
apprehended in experience. Nonetheless, the value of a stretch of
experience, indeed a whole life, isn&rsquo;t just the value (and
disvalue) of the parts, and in AKV, Lewis criticized Bentham&rsquo;s
attempt at a calculus of values. For Lewis, the intrinsic value found
in the experience of a symphony isn&rsquo;t just the sum of the
intrinsic value of the movements taken individually, but reflects the
character of the symphony as a temporal <em>Gestalt</em>. What is
<em>ultimately good</em> for Lewis is the quality of a life found good
in the living of it. (Lewis 1952b [1970, 179]) The constituent
experiences thus might have value for their own sake, but also value
for their contribution to the value of the whole life of which they
are parts. However, Lewis thought that judgements about how a valued
experience contributes to the value of a life as a whole are not
decisively verifiable or falsifiable. First, any attempt to apprehend
a life as a whole and the value of it as experienced goes beyond the
present of experience and relies on memory and expectation of past and
future experience and their values, and thereby leaves room for error.
Second, any attempt to simplify the problem by breaking a whole life
into parts and apprehending their value, and then calculating the
probability of their contributing to a good life as a whole, also
leaves room for error.</p>

<p>
The value of an object consists in its potentiality for conducing to
intrinsically valuable experiences, and is thus a real connection
between objects, persons, and the character of experience, which we
can be empirically warranted in accepting on the basis of empirical
evidence and the probability of such objects yielding such
intrinsically valuable experiences. For Lewis (1946, 432), therefore,
no object has intrinsic value. Nonetheless, objects can have
<em>inherent</em> value in so far as the good which they produce is
disclosable in the presence or observation of the object itself rather
than some other object. Lewis (1946, 437&ndash;443) contrasted
aesthetic value with cognitive and moral value, not by virtue of
distinctive characters of their felt goods, but chiefly by distinctive
attitudes to experience. The aesthetic attitude is one of
disinterested interest in the presented, attentiveness to the given in
its own right, as opposed to the cognitive attitude&rsquo;s concern
with prediction and significance for future experience, and the
concern on the part of the attitude of action or morality with the
pursuit of absent but attainable goods. Thanks to these differences,
aesthetic values in experience tend to be of high degree and long
lasting and don&rsquo;t require exclusive possession, and aesthetic
values in objects are inherent ones.</p>

<p>
Lewis recognized that potentialities are in various ways relative to
particular circumstances and manners of observation. There is thus a
plurality of judgements of the value of objects, of the various ways
in which they can contribute and fail to contribute to intrinsically
valuable experiences, and an apparent contradictory nature to
incomplete verbal statements of them (e.g., &ldquo;\(X\) is
good&rdquo;, &ldquo;\(X\) isn&rsquo;t good&rdquo;). For Lewis (1946,
528), issues about the relativity or subjectivity of judgements of the
value of objects aren&rsquo;t issues about the empirical truth of
attributions of value to objects, but just issues about whether the
conditions under which an object produces directly apprehended value
are peculiar to the nature and capacities of a particular person and
thus not indicative of the possibility of similar value finding on the
part of other persons. Quine (1979) argued that variation within and
among individuals and societies, and the variable and open ended
character of what they find valuable, means that predicates like
&ldquo;pleases&rdquo; or &ldquo; feels good&rdquo; don&rsquo;t support
inductive inferences from case to case in the way that
&ldquo;green&rdquo; or &ldquo;conducts electricity&rdquo; do.
Skepticism concerning the prospects for empirical truth of
attributions of value to objects is thus in order. Lewis, on the other
hand, seems to have thought that this contention implies that no one
could ever act with empirical warrant to improve his own lot in life
or do others any good, an absurdity in his view. Lewis argued at
length for the possibility of empirically warranted judgements of the
social or impersonal value of objects. The key is that &ldquo;value to
more than one person is to be assessed as if their several experiences
were to be included in that of a single person&rdquo; (Lewis (1946,
550). Rawls (1971, 188&ndash;90) criticized Lewis for mistaking
impersonality for impartiality, and denied the relevance of
Lewis&rsquo; account of impersonal value for questions of justice, at
least, for which impartiality is key. In the end, nonetheless, the
differences between Rawls&rsquo; view of the requirements of justice
and Rawls&rsquo; may seem to diminish.</p>

<p>
Lewis (1946, 554) ends AKV by claiming that &ldquo;valuation is always
a matter of empirical knowledge&rdquo; but &ldquo;what is right and
what is just can never be determined by empirical fact alone&rdquo;.
An action, for Lewis (1955a, 49), is subjectively right, and one we
are not to be blamed for doing, if we think it objectively right. An
action is objectively right if it is correctly judged on the evidence
that its consequences are such as it will be right to bring about, in
particular if we are justified in believing its consequences are
overall good, for us in the case of the prudentially right, for others
as well in the case of the morally right. Justified beliefs
aren&rsquo;t simply beliefs that are probable on the evidence, even
all the available evidence, a logical requirement for him that he
tends to emphasize in AKV and earlier works. They are in addition
&ldquo;characterized by that objectivity and integrity that summons
all pertinent evidence and gives all items their due weight&rdquo; in
conclusions drawn (Lewis 1955a, 79; Lewis 1959 [1969, 35]), in other
words, by the character exhibited in the thinking that produces
them.</p>

<p>
Right doing thus calls for right thinking, but &ldquo;thinking is
itself a way of acting and is indeed the manner of acting that is
peculiarly human&rdquo; (Lewis 1949 [1969, 127]) and
&ldquo;constitutes the possibility&rdquo; for distinctively human
deliberateness in action, corrigible, self-critical, self-governing,
and responsible. Humans, in distinction from other animals, Lewis
(1959 [1969, 78&ndash;9]) says, don&rsquo;t simply respond to
immediate experience, feelings, impulses, and promptings in
instinctive ways, but have the capacity to assess, correct, and direct
their thought and action in the light of foreseeable results and other
reasons, asking themselves &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and adjudicating their
answers. We thereby constrain our impulses and immediate promptings,
act on reasons and do so by reference to principles that hold for
others in the same circumstances. Often we may fail to do so, but we
have the capacity to do so, honed by self-improvement and critical
input from others, communication with and learning from others, and a
vast amount of socialization the practices of which have been honed
and improved over generations and represent the social memory of
humans (Lewis 1957, 94&ndash;5, 103&ndash;4). Directing action to
foreseeable ends, moreover, requires applying to the present and
future something learned from the past, and this is possible, Lewis
(1956, [1969, 120]) thinks, only by subsumption of the former in some
class with the latter and thus by reference to generalities
constituting reasons for thought and action and formulatable as maxims
or principles or imperatives. To be subject to imperatives is to find
a constraint of action or thought in what is not immediate. &ldquo;To
be rational&rdquo;, Lewis (1946, 480) says, &ldquo;means to be capable
of constraint by prevision of some future good or ill, to be amenable
to the consideration &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry if you
don&rsquo;t&rsquo;&rdquo;, and subjection to imperatives is simply a
feature of acting and living &ldquo;in human terms&rdquo; (Lewis 1946,
481).</p>

<p>
Right doing and thinking requires acting and thinking for reasons that
violate no categorical imperative. Lewis (1946, 480&ndash;82, 1955a,
Chapter 5, 1952b, 1952c, 1969) outlines categorical rational
imperatives of doing and thinking, or versions of one categorical
rational imperative in various ways, formulations, and detail. The
general idea is laid out briefly in AKV (Lewis (1946, 480&ndash;82),
but developed at greater length in his later ethical writings.
Rationality turns on consistency, and the logical is derivative from
the rational. Indeed, consistency of thought is for the sake of and
aimed at consistency in action, which in turn derives from consistency
in willing, i.e., of purposing and setting a value on. Logical
consistency turns on nowhere repudiating that to which we anywhere
commit ourselves to in our thought. Consistency in general consists in
not accepting now what we are unwilling to commit to elsewhere or
later. Consistency in what we think and do requires and is required by
conformity to principles, and consistency in what we think and do also
consists in not conforming to principles now, conformity to which we
are unwilling to commit to elsewhere or later.</p>

<p>
So there is a <em>categorical</em> rational imperative of consistency,
&ldquo; Be consistent in valuation and in thought and action&rdquo;
(Lewis 1946, 481). This isn&rsquo;t an imperative never to change
one&rsquo;s mind, Lewis (1956 [1969, 122]) notes, but rather never to
do so unless your previous belief or the reasons for it were incogent
and not governed by consistency, or your present change is made in the
light of further evidence and so on different premises. And there is a
broader imperative of cogency or basing one beliefs on cogent
reasoning from all the relevant evidence (Lewis 1955a, 32; 1952b, 202;
1952c, 213). And there likewise is an imperative of prudence, or
seeking the good, indeed the good life, for oneself on the advice of
cognition or foresight based on all the relevant evidence, overruling
opposed impulsions or inclinations. A proposition denying the
imperatives is not self-contradictory, but the act of denying them,
Lewis argues, is pragmatically self-contradictory and thus the
imperatives cannot be rationally repudiated. Is the person denying the
principle consistent in his denial, or taking himself to have good
reason for his denial , or seeking the good for himself with his
prescription, and so in these various ways contradicting himself? And
if he isn&rsquo;t and doesn&rsquo;t, why should we take him to be
making an assertion and saying something we should take seriously
rather than simply making idle noise? &ldquo;The making of any
statement implies, as an <em>act</em>, an import of credible
fact&rdquo; (Lewis 1949 [1969, 133], Lewis 1953 [1969, 168]), but the
denial of the imperatives undercuts that import. Lewis&rsquo; cited
models here are the Cretan who says &ldquo;All Cretans are
liars&rdquo; or the Cyrenaic who advises &ldquo;Take no heed for the
morrow!&rdquo; &ldquo;The ground of the validity of
imperatives&rdquo;, Lewis (1955a, 85&ndash;6) sometimes says, lies in
our human nature as social, deliberative, self-governing animals, but
not as an empirical premise for a conclusion. Imperatives that cannot
be rationally repudiated by us are <em>a priori</em> valid, Lewis
(1956, in Lewis 1969, 125) sometimes says. However, this is an <em>a
priori</em> validity that is different from the way that analytically
true propositions are <em>a priori</em> valid.</p>

<p>
At the root of these imperatives and others, Lewis (1953 [1969, 167];
1955a, 89) claims, is the Law of Objectivity: &ldquo;So conduct your
deliberate activities as to conform to the objective actualities
cognitively signified by your representational experience and not by
reference to any impulsion exercised by the affective quality of
experience&rdquo;, or more simply, govern oneself by the advice of
cognition (Lewis (1956 [1969, 167]; 1949 [1969, 135]). This is an
imperative that can be avoided only by the incapacity to deliberate
and make decisions, by ceasing, whether permanently or temporarily, to
be capable of that distinctively human activity, and thus that is
valid for all those capable of such activity. The law of objectivity
leads us to recognize that the feelings of others have as much
poignancy for them as ours do for us, that the reasons for acting and
thinking that we have are, when identical in them, as valid for them
as ours are for us (Lewis 1949 [1969, 141], 1952c [1970, 225]).</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;socially significant counterpart&rdquo; (Lewis 1955a,
90&ndash;91) of the law of objectivity then is the dictate of respect
for other persons as creatures whose feelings and enjoyment have the
same poignant factuality for them, as ours do for us, and as creatures
who, like ourselves, find it imperative to govern themselves in the
light of their knowledge, by decisions which they themselves reach, by
reference to their cognition and by reference to values discovered by
them, and to constrain present feelings and inclinations accordingly,
The first part is a Law of Compassion, of caring in some general way,
about other sentient beings, and, minimally, doing them no useless
harm, and the second a Law of Moral Equality or equal respect or for
ourselves and others as autonomous agents (Lewis 1955a, 91).
Politically, the second leads Lewis (1948 [1969, 155]) to the
endorsement of equality before the law, freedom of thought,
expression, publication, peaceful assembly and individual liberty
generally&ndash;something like the greatest liberty for each
compatible with a like liberty for all under a workable system of
law.</p>

<p>
Respect for the autonomy of others implies respect for their pursuit
of their own good. The problem, nonetheless, remains of reconciling
the imperatives of prudence and justice in practice, of reconciling
the good for oneself with the good for others in our self-directed,
principled, thinking and doing. What aids us is that, through language
and civilization, humans remember as a species and not merely as
individuals. What we are justified in thinking thereby is that human
achievement and social progress require autonomous, self-criticizing
and self-governing individuals, and that individual achievement and
realization of cherished goods require membership in a social order of
individuals co-operating in the pursuit of values cherished in common.
The contrast between individual prudence and social justice seems
fundamental, Lewis (1952c [1970, 214]) concludes, perhaps rather
optimistically, only by forgetting this, and &ldquo;only short
term&rdquo; thinking makes it seem otherwise.</p>
