<h1>Medieval Theories of Singular Terms</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Sep 25, 2003; substantive revision Mon Jul 22, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
A singular term is a term such as a proper name, a demonstrative
pronoun, like &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; (&lsquo;<em>hic</em>&rsquo; in
Latin), or a combination of a demonstrative pronoun and a common name,
like (&lsquo;this man&rsquo;), (&lsquo;<em>hic homo</em>&rsquo; in
Latin). This is the stable list of discrete terms we find in terminist
tracts from the beginning of the thirteenth century on. What they have
in common is that they all signify exactly one individual thing. These
expressions, as well as the metalinguistic expressions used to
describe them, whether individually or as a whole (&lsquo;proper
name&rsquo;, &lsquo;pronoun&rsquo;, &lsquo;singular/discrete
term&rsquo;), were the subject of in-depth inquiries during the Middle
Ages. Indeed, the problem of the signification of individuals is so
rich and important that, in a way, it presents a mirror image of the
more famous problem of universals in medieval philosophy.</p>

<p>
The existence of singular terms raises various questions about how
they function within a language. Do proper names have a sense as well
as a reference? Is there a real difference between proper names and
complex expressions such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo;? What about
singular terms whose referent has ceased to exist, such as
&lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;, or does not exist yet, such as
&lsquo;Antichrist&rsquo;? If they do have a sense, what is it? Is it,
for proper names, the proper quality of the grammarians, some
&lsquo;incommunicable quality&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Platonicity&rsquo;
mentioned by Boethius? How can a proper name such as
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; be a substantial or non-accidental name if the
quality it signifies is merely a bundle of accidents? How do singular
terms acquire their sense? How is this sense transmitted from one
speaker to another? Is a demonstrative pronoun purely referential? If
one believes in a language of thought, or mental language, as did many
medieval thinkers, what is the mental correlate of a singular
term?</p>

<p>
While medieval thinkers did not produce any treatises devoted to
singular terms, their writings do contain answers to these questions,
or at least, to similar questions they themselves posed in the context
of their own semantic theories. To discover medieval views of singular
terms, one must consult a variety of sources from grammar, especially
in works by Priscian (sixth century CE), where the grammar of proper
names was presented in a philosophically-tinged terminology, in logic
(with the medieval interpretations of singular terms in
Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> and Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em>, <em>De interpretatione</em>, and <em>Prior
Analytics</em>), in philosophy (especially in commentaries on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em>, <em>De anima</em>, and
<em>Metaphysics</em>), and theology. In the Middle Ages and still at
the beginning of the sixteenth century, singular terms were discussed
in treatises devoted to types of terms in termnist logic or in
treatises on <em>sophismata</em>.</p>

<p>
Singular terms became a major topic of interest during the first
decades of twelfth century, emerging from the rich dialogue that was
occurring between the disciplines of grammar and logic. There were
numerous efforts to develop a semantics of proper names, with the idea
that proper names should have a special kind of direct reference while
still being distinct from pronouns. The idea that logically proper
names should be distinct from ordinary, grammatically proper names was
present from the beginning. During the thirteenth century, debates
about the semantics of proper names flourished, where the notion of
proper names as &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; names, not unlike pronouns,
became more and more problematical. After Peter Abelard&rsquo;s
remarkable theory of proper names (in the 1110s), the commentaries of
John Buridan (d. before 1361) provided the most comprehensive and
coherent medieval theory of singular terms, one which remained
influential into the sixteenth century. Paul of Venice&rsquo;s
treatise is also worthy of mention here, despite the difficulty of
construing many of his claims. During the sixteenth century, singular
concepts continued to be a subject of discussion in commentaries on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> and <em>De anima</em>, but the
logicians who came after Domingo de Soto (1494&ndash;1560) offered
only cursory treatments of the subject. With a few exceptions, such as
the logic of Hobbes and the Port Royal logic (see P&eacute;charman,
forthcoming), we have to wait until the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries for the problems that exercised John Buridan in the
fourteenth century to be fully appreciated once more.</p>

<h2 id="DiffTypeSingTerm">1. Different Types of Singular Terms</h2>

<p>
Obviously, expressions such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; and &lsquo;this
[one]&rsquo; existed long before they began to be thought about as
&lsquo;proper names&rsquo; and &lsquo;pronouns&rsquo; respectively,
whether in technical grammars (the distinction between proper and
common names being fixed around the first century BC), or in medieval
logic, as &lsquo;singular terms&rsquo; or &lsquo;discrete
terms&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Medieval authors had only the term &lsquo;<em>nomen</em>&rsquo;
available to them, whereas in English we have two expressions:
&lsquo;noun&rsquo;, typically used in grammars to designate
grammatical function, and &lsquo;name&rsquo;, a broader expression
used in everyday life but also in logic. In order to reflect the
single word in Latin and to capture both the linguistic and the
philosophical dimensions of the debate, we will use the term
&lsquo;proper names&rsquo; in what follows, even in circumstances
where &lsquo;proper nouns&rsquo; would be preferable
grammatically.</p>

<p>
The idea of singular terms as a specific linguistic and philosophical
phenomenon was present in Aristotle&rsquo;s logic, well before the
advent of technical grammar, most influentially in his definition of
singular propositions in <em>De interpretatione</em> 7 as containing
terms such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, as opposed to particular or
indefinite propositions with terms such as &lsquo;man&rsquo;. It was
also present in the <em>Categories</em> 1, with the idea that first
substance signifies a &lsquo;this something [<em>hoc
aliquid</em>]&rsquo;, and in Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em>, where
the notion of an &lsquo;individual predicable&rsquo;is introduced. The
examples given by Porphyry are &lsquo;the son of Sophroniscus&rsquo;
(provided he has only one son), &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, &lsquo;this
white&rsquo;, and &lsquo;this one coming&rsquo; (II/15), to which
Boethius added &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; in his commentaries on the
<em>Isagoge</em>. Porphyry says: &ldquo;Such things are said to be
individuals, since each of them consists of properties whose
collection will never be the same in another&rdquo; (<em>Isagoge</em>,
II/15). Boethius then interprets Porphyrian properties as bundles of
accidents (<em>In Isagogen editio prima</em>, p. 81, 26&ndash;82, 9),
thereby providing crucial materials for the medieval theory of
individuation by accidents (see Brumberg-Chaumont 2013a).</p>

<p>
It should be noted that there are no expressions such as
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>, where
Aristotle instead uses the term &lsquo;a certain man&rsquo; to signify
first substances (Gk. <em>ho tis anthr&ocirc;pos</em>). The Greek
expression had rather a deictic sense. Yet it was translated by
Boethius as &lsquo;<em>aliquis homo</em> [some man]&rsquo;, that is,
using the same expression that was used to indicate particular
propositions in Aristotle&rsquo;s logic (as in &lsquo;some man is an
animal&rsquo;), as opposed to singular propositions (as in
&lsquo;Socrates is a man&rsquo;). This is probably the reason why the
Boethian translation tended to be replaced by proper names in
commentaries on the <em>Categories</em> after Porphyry, as well as by
new expressions, such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo; (<em>hic homo</em>),
introduced by twelfth-century commentators. Expressions such as
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; or &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; began to be
described using the grammatical categories of proper names and
pronouns by logicians beginning in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>
Discussions of singular terms were frequently related to the
aforementioned passage from Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> (II,
15), which offered medieval logicians the basis for a classification
of types of singular terms. This classification changed over time,
reflecting changing paradigms in logic. For example, in
Buridan&rsquo;s classification (see &sect;5 below), the &lsquo;vague
indidvual&rsquo; is &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, while for Simon of
Faversham, the &lsquo;vague individual&rsquo; is &lsquo;some
man&rsquo; (Commentary on the <em>Tractatus</em>, ed. De Rijk, pp. 88
and 93). In Porphyry&rsquo;s passage, we find &lsquo;the son of
Sophroniscus&rsquo;, that is, what we would now call an indefinite
description, given that the stipulation that Sophroniscus has only one
son is not part of the phrase but merely background information. This
fact is enough to ensure that the phrase refers to only one
individual, but it does not alter its linguistic generality. There was
little specific discussion of definite descriptions, but it seems they
would have been treated in the same way. John Buridan gives the most
direct treatment in his analysis of the phrase, &lsquo;the first
Christian king of France [<em>primus rex Francie
christianus</em>]&rsquo; (<em>In metaphysicem</em> VII/20). This he
took to be general, insofar as it is made up of common concepts. In
another place (<em>In metaphysicem</em> VII/18), he considers the
phrase, &lsquo;the largest and brightest heavenly body [<em>planeta
maximus et lucidissimus</em>]&rsquo;, used to refer to the sun,
remarking that the very same phrase could, without any new imposition,
supposit for a second sun if God were to create another sun similar to
or greater than the first sun in size and brightness. He could be
interpreted as saying that the very same phrase could, without being
given any new signification, refer to different individuals in
different possible worlds (see Ashworth 2004a, pp. 128&ndash;129).</p>

<h2 id="VariApprSingTermMediThou">2. Various Approaches to Singular Terms in Medieval Thought</h2>

<h3 id="PropNamePronGram">1.1 Proper Names and Pronouns in Grammar</h3>

<p>
The ancient Stoics made a clear distinction between names (which
became the proper names of technical grammar) and appellations (which
became appellative names) as two different parts of speech. For the
Stoics, names such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; did not generate
determinate propositions, unlike articulations (&lsquo;this
[one]&rsquo;), that is, what we now know as &lsquo;pronouns&rsquo;;
rather, they produced intermediary propositions, in the same manner as
propositions with appellations (&lsquo;man&rsquo;). This is because,
unlike articulations/pronouns, names do not guarantee the presence or
existence of the individual (see Brunschwig 1984). The fact that the
name &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; could &ndash; provided it is not equivocal
&ndash; identify the exact same individual as &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo;
was considered irrelevant. However, the differentiating and
identifying properties of proper names became crucial in Greek
grammatical and logical theories developed during the late ancient
period and the Middle Ages (see Brumberg-Chaumont 2013a).</p>

<p>
During the Middle Ages, the most important ancient grammatical text
was Priscian&rsquo;s <em>Institutiones</em>, a treatise inspired by
the Greek grammar of Apollonius Dyscolus (second century CE), which
was strongly influenced by philosophical concepts. According to
Priscian, the <em>nomen</em> is the first principal part of speech. It
signifies, as proper to this part of speech, &ldquo;a substance and a
quality&rdquo;. Names are divided into common or appellative names and
proper names. Because proper names are a species of name and hence a
fully-fledged part of language, they were understood to have the same
semantic properties as common names, including a sense. According to
Priscian, proper names such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; signify a
particular substance and its proper quality. Indeed,
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; signifies a substance no differently than the
other names of substance, i.e., special and generic names such as
&lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;animal&rsquo;, so that the quality it
signifies must be a substantial quality. Names of substances are
opposed to adjectives signifying qualities, quantities, or number (for
the two (or three) senses of &lsquo;substance&rsquo; and
&lsquo;quality&rsquo;, see Baratin 1989 and Brumberg-Chaumont
2007/2011). Following Apollonius, Priscian says that proper names also
signify the quality of the corresponding species. Thus, if I say
&lsquo;Virgil&rsquo;, the common quality of man will also be
understood. When combined with the Porphyrian definition of
individuality as a bundle of properties or accidents, this gave rise
to theories according to which the proper quality signified by a
proper name contains the essential quality of the species, associated
with a bundle of identifying accidents (see Brumberg-Chaumont
2013a).</p>

<p>
As proper to this part of speech, pronouns signify the substance only,
thanks to their deictic power. The type of pronoun we are interested
in here is what medieval grammarians called the primitive
(non-derived) demonstrative pronoun, which includes personal pronouns
such as &lsquo;I&rsquo; and demonstratives such as &lsquo;this
[one]&rsquo;. Demonstration (construed as the act of pointing to
something) can be either direct, when something is right before
one&rsquo;s eyes, or intellectual, or a mixture of the two. Setting
aside intellectual demonstration, which occurs when the object is
incorporeal or absent, the use of a demonstrative pronoun in normal
circumstances has the implication that the object pointed to must be
present to the speaker. Pronouns were used only instead of proper
names (not of common names) because they both signify one thing.
Priscian, following Apollonius, also noticed that the deictic
demonstration performed by pronouns includes, as an incidental
component, the proper quality belonging to the individual demonstrated
(<em>Institutiones</em> XVII, 71, GL III, p. 149, 8&ndash;10).</p>

<p>
However, against the earlier tradition, Priscian contended that proper
qualities will never permit us to designate one single individual
unless that individual is demonstrated with a pronoun; the inability
of proper qualities to do this is stated in principle, i.e., without
taking into account the problem of homonymy (<em>Institutions</em>
XVII, 63; GL III, p. 145, 16&ndash;146, 6; see Baratin 2006). On the
contrary, the power of proper names to designate one individual
(setting aside homonymy) was crucial for his model (Apollonius), as it
precisely explained why pronouns can be used instead of proper names
only. This somewhat puzzling aspect of Priscian&rsquo;s doctrine was
ignored by medieval thinkers, who maintained that proper names and
pronouns have a similar (although not identical) referential
power.</p>

<h3 id="SynoMetaEqui">2.2 Synonymy, Metaphor, and Equivocation</h3>

<p>
Proper names sometimes exhibited the features of common names in
various respects. For instance, they could be used metaphorically or
metonymically. &lsquo;Achilles&rsquo; can refer to strong men;
likewise, &lsquo;Nero&rsquo; was used to signify a cruel man. More
importantly, &lsquo;Marcus&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tullius&rsquo;, as two
names of the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero, were favorite
examples of synonymous terms. As such, they featured in discussions of
the problem of intentional contexts. From classical times on, proper
names such as &lsquo;Ajax&rsquo; and &lsquo;Alexander&rsquo; provided
standard examples of equivocal terms. However, it was obvious that
there were reasons for giving one proper name rather than another.
This suggested to at least some authors that proper names need not be
regarded as chance equivocals. In his commentary on the
<em>Categories</em>, Paul of Venice claimed that some names, such as
&lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo; and &lsquo;Plato&rsquo; are purely equivocal.
However, if several men are called &lsquo;John&rsquo; because they
were born on the Feast of St. John, the name &lsquo;John&rsquo; should
be regarded as a univocal term (<em>In praedicamenta</em>, ms.
Bodleian, Canon. misc. 452, f. 81ra; see Ashworth 2003, p. 130). He
overlooked the distinction made by his contemporary, John Dorp,
between a common reason for giving the same name to two children, and
the different singular concepts which that name signified. Dorp argued
that a common reason was not enough for univocity
(<em>Compendium</em>, sig. 2rb). In the sixteenth century, Domingo de
Soto used the newly-rediscovered commentary on the <em>Categories</em>
by Philoponus (wrongly attributed to Ammonius) to introduce a new type
of deliberate equivocal, &ldquo;from hope and memory&rdquo;. One might
call one&rsquo;s son &lsquo;Plato&rsquo; in the hope of his becoming a
philosopher, or &lsquo;Nicomachus&rsquo; in memory of one&rsquo;s
father, or &lsquo;Charles&rsquo; in honor of the Emperor (for more on
the topic, see Ashworth 2003).</p>

<p>
In Priscian, appellative names are &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; common to
the several things they name, whereas proper names are
&ldquo;naturally&rdquo; the name of only one individual
(<em>Institutiones</em> II, 24&ndash;25; GL II, pp. 58, 14&ndash;59,
1). During the late Middle Ages, while almost everyone except Paul of
Venice agreed that proper names must always be equivocal when used of
two different people, not everyone wanted to say that they were
univocal when used of the same person. The reason had to do with the
definition of a univocal term as involving a concept or a
quality/nature in principle predicable of several individuals. The
usual solution was simply to redefine &lsquo;univocal&rsquo; so as to
include proper names, but the <em>Categories</em> commentaries by
Albert of Saxony, Marsilius of Inghen, and Paul of Venice contain
fairly extensive discussions of the issue. Both Albert
(<em>Quaestiones in Artem Veterem</em>, p. 294, 345, 302) and Paul
(<em>In predicamenta</em>, ms Bodleian, Canon. msc. 452, 83rb-va,
unpuslished see Ashworth 2003, p. 239) agreed in opposition to
Marsilius (<em>Quaestiones in libri predicamentorum</em>, Bodleian ms.
Canon misc. 381, f. 18rb-va; see Ashworth 2003, p. 240) that a proper
name could be equivocal without being said to be univocal when used of
one person.</p>

<h3 id="DemoPronDemoExprLogi">2.3 Demonstrative Pronouns and Demonstrative Expressions in Logic</h3>

<p>
The standard examples of demonstratives were &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo;
or &lsquo;this man&rsquo;. The mental correlate in the second case is
a common concept individuated by a demonstrative act. Because
&lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; is tied to particular demonstrative acts,
Buridan, like many other logicians in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and
early sixteenth centuries, believed that genuinely referring uses of
the vocal expression &lsquo;this man&rsquo; are equivocal . What I
signify when I say &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, pointing to Socrates, is
quite different from what you signify when you say &lsquo;this
man&rsquo;, pointing to Plato, and every use of the phrase requires a
new imposition (see &sect;5.1 below). As de Soto pointed out
(<em>Summule</em>, f. xix rb), this is quite compatible with the claim
that &lsquo;this man&rsquo; has an unchanging general sense understood
by all speakers of Latin. It is also compatible with failures of
reference of various sorts, as Buridan and others frequently remarked.
I can say &lsquo;this man&rsquo; and point to a donkey (and the
proposition will be false), or to nothing (and the proposition will be
incongruent, having no truth-value). Similarly, I can utter
&lsquo;this chimera&rsquo;, a phrase that can never have a referent
since chimeras are impossible objects.</p>

<p>
One might suppose that indicating or pointing is all that a
demonstrative pronoun does. As we have seen, Priscian claimed that
whereas a name signifies substance and quality (or a substance
&ldquo;with a quality&rdquo; in the medieval formulation, i.e., a
referent plus its property), the pronoun signifies the substance
alone, without quality, i.e., a bare referent. However, medieval
grammarians and logicians tended to demand some identification of the
object denoted. For the use of the pronoun alone, it should be
remembered that Latin grammar does not distinguish between
demonstrative adjectives, as in &lsquo;This man is white&rsquo;, and
demonstrative pronouns, as in &lsquo;This is a white man&rsquo;. The
Latin term <em>hic</em> is always a pronoun, so that &lsquo;this man
[<em>hic homo</em>]&rsquo; was probably spontaneously/linguistically
understood as something like &lsquo;this one, a man&rsquo;. In
English, one does not really say &lsquo;This runs&rsquo;, speaking of
a man, which is why <em>hic</em> has been translated here as
&lsquo;this [one]&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
The sense of &lsquo;<em>hic</em>&rsquo; was the subject of in-depth
logical reflections. For Dorp and other later logicians, ordinary
demonstrative pronouns such as &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; require the
presence of an identifying concept. This raised the question of what
it is in the mind that corresponds to the pronoun, a question which
implicates the more general issue of the mental correlate of
syncategorematic terms, that is, terms that perform some logical
function (e.g., &lsquo;not&rsquo;, &lsquo;and&rsquo;,
&lsquo;or&rsquo;), as opposed to categorematic terms, which are
typically nouns and adjectives that fall under Aristotle&rsquo;s
categories. Some thinkers, such as Ockham, thought there are no
pronouns in mental language (see &sect;5 below). One could argue that
demonstrative pronouns are disguised categorematic terms and that the
mental correlate of &lsquo;This man runs&rsquo; is &lsquo;The man
Socrates runs&rsquo; (see Ashworth 2004a, p. 131&ndash;132). On the
more common view, pronouns are subordinated to special demonstrative
or relational acts in the mind. If the pronoun is joined to a noun in
a spoken phrase, then it represents a purely syncategorematic act in
the mind. If it appears alone in a spoken phrase, there are two
possibilities, as John Dorp argued (<em>Compendium</em>, sig. b 2ra).
First, it could be taken to be subordinated to a mental phrase
containing both a syncategorematic act and a name, in which case it
would be legitimate. Alternatively, it could be taken as purely
syncategorematic, but this use would be illegitimate because there is
no indication of the thing pointed to and a purely syncategorematic
term cannot be the subject of a proposition. You cannot successfully
entertain the proposition &lsquo;This [one] is running&rsquo; without
identifying the &lsquo;this&rsquo; in some way. However, it seems that
the identification need not involve a sortal concept; a singular
concept is sufficient (more on this in &sect;5 below, in connection
with Buridan&rsquo;s theory).</p>

<h3 id="SingTermLogi">2.4 Singular Terms in Logic</h3>

<p>
One important problem raised by the use of proper names in logic is
that proper names are supposed to signify a proper quality where
accidental features are included, which would mean that they are
accidental names or &ldquo;connotative&rdquo; terms, following the
fourteenth-century terminology. Singular terms need to correspond to
qualities or concepts that would have to be singular, simple, and
essential, i.e., non-connotative or &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; in the
fourteenth-century terminology). But this seemed difficult to achieve.
Another major preoccupation was the fact that in many theories, proper
names seemed to have only a momentary reference or even to depend on
the existence of their bearer for their signification. Yet another
problem was the fact that proper names were described as not being
predicable, following Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>, or as
being predicable of only one thing, following Porphyry&rsquo;s
<em>Isagoge</em>, whereas they could also be predicated in a
predication &lsquo;by accident&rsquo; according to the <em>Prior
Analytics</em> (see Ashworth 2004b).</p>

<p>
The use of singular terms in inferences raised various issues. To
begin with syllogistic: despite the fact that proper names never occur
in Aristotle&rsquo;s text as examples in valid syllogisms or even in
expository syllogisms, proper names were soon introduced by
commentators. This created new problems. Some logicians offered a
standard account of the Aristotelian syllogism centered on the
universal and particular quantification of general terms, but at the
same time included examples featuring singular terms, e.g.,
&lsquo;Every man is an animal, Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates
is an animal&rsquo;. One such logician was Lambert of Auxerre (or
Lagny), author of a widely read textbook <em>Summa Lamberti</em>. More
detailed presentations of syllogistic included an account of the
expository syllogism, which is in the third figure and has a singular
middle term, as well as of other syllogisms with singular terms. This
seemed to go against generally granted syllogistic principles such as
&ldquo;One premise must always be universal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nothing
follows from two particular premises&rdquo;. Lambert dealt with the
former problem when addressing enthymematic inferences with a singular
term by appealing to formulations such as &ldquo;Everything that is
Socrates is a man (instead of &lsquo;Socrates is a man&rsquo; as the
unformulated premisse), Socrates runs, therefore a man runs&rdquo;. He
thereby reduces &ldquo;Socrates runs, therefore a man runs&rdquo; to a
syllogism (<em>Summa Lamberti</em>, p. 139&ndash;140, tr. Maloney p.
172). Buridan prefered to reject the first principle and John Dorp
explained that the second principle did not apply unless
&lsquo;particular&rsquo; was used in a narrow sense of &lsquo;neither
universal nor singular&rsquo;. Robert Kilwardby, who wrote an
influential commentary on the <em>Prior Analytics</em> in the 1240s in
Paris, wanted to resist the introduction of any kind of singular term
in instances of canonical valid syllogistic combinations (he used
singular terms only for exporitory syllogisms), allowing only
particular propositions (see &sect;4.4 below). In the seventeenth
century, some logicians treated singular propositions as equivalent to
universal propositions, but, as Dorp&rsquo;s remarks suggest, medieval
logicians preferred to classify singular propositions as particular
propositions (see Ashworth 1970, pp. 19 ff.; Ashworth 1974, pp. 247
ff.).</p>

<p>
Singular terms were also part of the theory of suppositional descent,
e.g., when one infers from &lsquo;Every man is running&rsquo;:
&lsquo;Socrates is running&rsquo;, &lsquo;Plato is running&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Cicero is running&rsquo;, etc.; or &lsquo;this man is
running&rsquo;, and &lsquo;that man is running&rsquo;, etc. In the
earlier Middle Ages, logicians did not seem to worry about the use of
proper names as opposed to demonstrative phrases, but there was some
discussion of possible problems in the later period. One problem
concerned the fact that there are different types of singular name.
Men are called &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, &lsquo;Plato&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;Cicero,&rsquo; but donkeys are called &lsquo;Browny
(<em>Brunellus</em>)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Tawny (<em>Favellus</em>)&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;Little Grey (<em>Grisellus</em>)&rsquo;, so what happens if
someone produces the inference, &lsquo;Every man is running;
therefore, Brownie is running and Tawny is running&rsquo;? After all,
this inference has exactly the same logical form as &lsquo;Every man
is running; therefore, Socrates is running and Plato is
running&rsquo;. Moreover, even if one has the correct type of proper
name, its bearer may die, rendering the conclusion false while the
premise remains true. If one adopts the preferred solution of
replacing proper names with demonstrative phrases, a similar problem
arises. If &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; does not succeed in pointing to a
living man, then &lsquo;Every man is running; therefore, this man is
running&rsquo; would be an inference with a true premise and a false
conclusion. The problem could be dealt with by adding premises to
ensure that the very same things referred to by the true premise(s)
are also referred to by the demonstrative phrases in the conclusion.
Many other approaches and solutions to this problem were discussed
during the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries (see &sect;&sect; 4
and 5 below).</p>

<p>
Medieval logicians also spent a lot of time thinking about he problem
of referring to deceased individuals. There were three issues. First,
there was the problem that the same words are used to speak of, e.g.,
a living person and of a corpse. Following Aristotle
(<em>Meteorology</em> 389b31) and Augustine (<em>On Dialectic</em>),
logicians were content to accept that if I point to a corpse and say
&lsquo;This is a man&rsquo; or &lsquo;This is Peter&rsquo;, then
&lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;Peter&rsquo; are being used equivocally,
in some different or extended sense. Second, there was the problem of
establishing a referent for such propositions as &lsquo;Adam was in
Paradise&rsquo; or &lsquo;Adam is dead&rsquo;. Here supposition theory
came into play, for it allowed reference not just to present objects,
but also to past, future, and possible objects. Third, there was the
problem which was the focus of special attention in the second half of
the thirteenth century, namely, whether the proposition &lsquo;Caesar
is a man&rsquo; is true, considering that &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; is used
for an individual that has existed but no longer exists, whereas
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; is supposed to refer to a presently-existing
individual. This question had to do in large part with the
interpretation of &lsquo;is&rsquo;. The issue here is whether proper
names lose their signification when their bearer dies. If they do, it
seems that any discussion of the past will be senseless. The solutions
illustrate the importance of the mind in signification. For instance,
Boethius of Dacia said that &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; signifies the same
individual that has existed after Socrates&rsquo;s death even if
Socrates does not exist any longer because the signification of words
depends on intellection, which itself does not depend on the existence
of things (<em>Boethii Daci Aliorumque Sophismata</em>, p.
127&ndash;128). An opposing view was presented by Roger Bacon, who
held that proper names are radically equivocal because they are
subject to being reimposed on the representation when the individual
named ceases to exist (<em>De signis</em>, &sect;26). The person who
cries out &lsquo;John is dead&rsquo;, intending to refer either to a
thing in the past or to a corpse, has given a new imposition to the
word &lsquo;John&rsquo;, even if his grief prevents him from realizing
it.</p>

<h3 id="SingTermTheo">2.5 Singular Terms in Theology</h3>

<p>
Proper names began to be discussed by the Cappadocian Fathers in
connection with theological matters (see Kalligas 2002; Robertson
2002). Problems of naming often arose in theological contexts and
Aquinas&rsquo;s own list of reasons for bestowing proper names is part
of his discussion of whether Christ was appropriately named
&lsquo;Jesus&rsquo;. The term &lsquo;God&rsquo; was the focus of
particular attention. Praepositinus of Cremona said that properly
speaking, &lsquo;God&rsquo; is neither a proper name nor a common
term, whereas other early theologians suggested that it is a proper
name because it refers to a reality that can only be singular. The
majority view was expressed by Aquinas, who argued that the term
&lsquo;God&rsquo; is similar to the term &lsquo;sun&rsquo; insofar as
we know that both have only one referent, although in the case of God,
the term <em>can</em> have only one referent. Even so,
&lsquo;God&rsquo; is a common term. For many later medieval logicians,
the term &lsquo;God&rsquo; appears along with &lsquo;sun&rsquo; and
&lsquo;moon&rsquo; as examples of words that are not singular terms,
despite the fact that they supposit for only one thing.</p>

<p>
The Trinity caused particular problems for logicians because of the
unique relation between the three persons and the one divine essence
which is, as Ockham put it in his <em>Summa logicae</em>, &ldquo;one
and simple and one in number and singular to the highest degree, and
yet in several things.&rdquo; Inferences such as &lsquo;This divine
essence is the Father, this divine essence is the Son; therefore, the
Father is the Son&rsquo; seem to have true premises asserting an
identity between singular things, yet the conclusion is unacceptable.
Various solutions were found, including some that explored various
senses of identity and different types of predication (for more
paralogisms of the Trinity, see Gelber 1974 and 2004; Boehner 1944).
The Roman Catholic doctrine of transsubstantiation led to a discussion
of demonstrative phrases. When the priest elevates the bread during
the Eucharist and utters the words &lsquo;This is my body&rsquo;, the
substance is said to change from bread into the body of Christ. What,
then, is the referent of the word &lsquo;this&rsquo;? (see
Rosier-Catach 2004).</p>

<h2 id="SemaSingTermTwelCentLogiGram">3. The Semantic of Singular Terms in Twelfth-Century Logic and Grammar</h2>

<h3 id="NewElem-1">3.1 New Elements</h3>

<p>
Priscian&rsquo;s <em>Institutiones</em>, rich with philosophical
insights (see the contributions by Luthala, Ebbesen, and Garcea in
Hotltz <em>et al</em>. 2009), was the subject of
philosophically-inspired commentaries since the beginning of the
twelfth century (Rosier-Catach 2011; Grondeux and Rosier-Catach 2017).
The first in-depth commentaries on what was later known as the
<em>logica vetus</em> or &lsquo;Old Logic&rsquo; (i.e.,
Boethius&rsquo; Latin translations and commentaries on
Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> and Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em> and <em>De interpretatione</em>, plus a few other
texts) began during the same period (Rosier-Catach and Goubier 2019).
Masters from the twelfth century offered sophisticated semantic
discussions of proper names, in which logic and grammar were
fruitfully combined (Brumberg-Chaumont 2007; Brumberg-Chaumont,
forthcoming-b). They employed a new distinction between nomination and
signification, identifying the grammatical &lsquo;proper
quality&rsquo; with the Porphyrian &lsquo;bundle of properties&rsquo;
&mdash; or accidents, as Boethius interpreted them &mdash; which was
in turn connected to Boethius &lsquo;Platonicity&rsquo;, the
&lsquo;incommunicable property&rsquo;. These two novelties are already
found in an anonymous multi-layered commentary, the <em>Glosulae</em>,
which is the first important commentary on Priscian&rsquo;s
<em>Institutiones</em>, dating from the very beginning of the twelfth
century (partial ed. in Rosier-Catach 2008). This text says that a
name (whether proper or common) (i) signifies a quality (whether
proper or common), which it does not name, and (ii) names a substance
or several substances as determined by that quality: an individual
substance in the case of proper names such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;,
via the proper quality, i.e., the unique bundle of accidents plus the
quality of the species they signify; a plurality of substances in the
case of common names such as &lsquo;man&rsquo;, via the common quality
they signify. Proper names were also compared to pronouns, as they
were in traditional grammar. The parallelism was reinforced because,
as early as the <em>Glosulae</em>, proper names were endowed with the
same ability to identify strictly a &ldquo;determinate person&rdquo;,
something that was the absolute preserve of pronouns in ancient
grammar.</p>

<p>
The logico-grammatical context that characterized twelfth-century
discussions gave rise to a set of specific issues. The problem of the
substantiality of the signification exhibited by proper names such as
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; became a major preoccupation in logic, where
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; had to belong to the category of substance by
the essential determination through which it signifies the subject and
not only because what it signifies is indeed a substance. But this was
the case in grammar as well. In Priscian&rsquo;s theory too, as we
have seen, proper names such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; must belong to
the category of names signifying substance, as opposed to adjectives,
which signify accidents such as quality, quantity, or number. The
issue was made especially difficult because of the identification of
the grammatical proper quality with the Porphyrian unique set of
accidents. This identification and the prevalent doctrine of
individuation by accidents to which it was associated were indeed
harshly criticized by Abelard.</p>

<p>
The distinction between naming and signifying became the main
instrument for the most powerful solutions put forward. This gave rise
for the first time to fully-fledged semantic theories of proper names,
i.e., theories ascribing a semantic structure to proper names distinct
from that of common names, as well as from pronouns. Proper names were
conceptualized as referring expressions with a special medieval
variety of direct reference: a reference not determined by descriptive
content (which, in this period, would inevitably have been brought to
mind a unique bundle of accidents), but nonetheless able to signify
additionally the proper quality, as well as to directly name and
signify the individual substance (as in William of Conches; see
Brumberg-Chaumont 2011) or as having the &ldquo;determination&rdquo;
or &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the substantial special quality (as in
Abelard).</p>

<h3 id="SingTermPeteAbelLogi">3.2 Singular Terms in Peter Abelard&rsquo;s Logic</h3>

<p>
In the <em>Dialectica</em> and the <em>Logica Ingredientibus</em>
(composed between 1116 and 1119), Abelard offered an incredibly
complex and complete approach. He developed his theory of proper names
and pronouns in constant dialogue with grammar, especially ideas found
in the <em>Glosulae</em>. He explicitly referred to Priscian and to
his contemporary interpreters when he castigated any theory of
individuation by the accidents as self-contradictory. He could not
accept that the proper name &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; signifies a unique
bundle of accidents, &lsquo;Socrateity&rsquo;, or worse, that
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; would name these accidents in addition to
Socrates himself, because such accidents would be constitutive of
Socrates as the individual he is (<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 63,
31&ndash;64, 6; p. 64, 26&ndash;32).</p>

<p>
Building a robust semantics of proper names is crucial to
Abelard&rsquo;s logic, insofar as his rejection of realism and his
strict ontological particularism make universal names especially
problematic, since nothing that is universal exists in itself or in
any individual. On the contrary, proper names are the sole linguistic
entities to which a real thing &mdash; the individual Socrates in the
case of &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; &mdash; obviously corresponds. For
Abelard, the individual and individuality are primary data that do not
need to be explained: the individual &ldquo;consists simply in
personal distinction&rdquo; (<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 64,
20&ndash;24). This does not mean that Abelard can be satisfied with
proper names that refer directly, without &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;
(<em>sensus</em>), because the Aristotelian category to which a proper
name belongs is decided by the determination carried out by the name,
not by the thing named itself (<em>Glossae super Predicamenta</em>, p.
116); it is the same meaning of the predicate term and the subject
term that decides whether a proposition is essential or not. The
meaning of &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; must be essential if
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; is to be in the category of the substance and
if &lsquo;Socrates is a man&rsquo; is to be an essential
proposition.</p>

<p>
Part of Abelard&rsquo;s solution consists in saying that proper names
such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; mean exactly the same thing as
&lsquo;this man&rsquo;, namely, &ldquo;man in his personal
distinction&rdquo;. This theory is a consequence of the new use of
examples such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo; as names of primary substances
in commentaries on the <em>Categories</em>. We see this use in
Abelard&rsquo;s <em>Logica ingredientibus</em>, but it must have
existed in earlier anonymous texts, as he himself suggests, because he
criticizes those who differentiate &lsquo;this man&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;: &ldquo;[Some people] want &lsquo;this
man&rsquo; to be the sign [<em>notare</em>] of nothing other than man
in his personal essence, but this name which is
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, they say, designates the accidents&rdquo;
(<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 64, 26&ndash;30). Abelard claims the
two expressions are equivalent in logic, as opposed to grammar, where
the signification of the accidents via the notion of a proper quality
seemed to him inevitable. This means that, in grammar, we would have a
new meaning (<em>acceptio</em>) for the name &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;
and that this name would no longer signify the individual as a
substance (<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 65, 5&ndash;11).</p>

<p>
Abelard draws a clear distinction between naming and signifying in the
cases of proper names and common names. He asserts: &ldquo;by
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; &hellip; a certain thing is determined and
identified &hellip; Singular names [can] not only name, but also
determine the underlying thing.&rdquo; On the other hand,
&ldquo;&lsquo;man&rsquo; is rightly said to signify neither Socrates
nor any other, for none [of them] is identified by virtue of the name,
though it does name the singulars&rdquo; (<em>Super Porphyrium</em>,
p. 21, 36&ndash;22, 6). Abelard also contends that proper names and
appellative names have different causes of invention: the
&ldquo;distinction of the substance&rdquo; for the former, and the
&ldquo;quality of the substance&rdquo; for the latter (<em>Glossae
super Predicamenta</em>, p. 157, 29&ndash;31).</p>

<p>
Proper names are, however, clearly distinguished from pronouns, in
connection with which the traditional grammatical description is
mobilized when Abelard encounters terms such as &ldquo;this
[on]&rdquo; among the predicables in Boethius&rsquo;s commentary.
These terms are said to signify a &ldquo;pure substance&rdquo;; they
have been &ldquo;invented according to personal distinction&rdquo;
only; &ldquo;they determine no nature or property&rdquo; (<em>Super
Porphyrium</em>, p. 39, 16&ndash;24). Here the second part of
Abelard&rsquo;s solution appears: although proper names were not
invented to determine qualities, proper names do determine qualities,
i.e., &ldquo;the same qualities as those contained in superior names
[<em>superiora nomina</em>]&rdquo; (<em>Glossae super
Predicamenta</em>, p. 157, 31&ndash;32). By &lsquo;superior
names&rsquo;, he was referring to names located above individual names
in Porphyry&rsquo;s tree, such as &lsquo;animal&rsquo; and
&lsquo;man&rsquo;. Here we meet again the idea, inherited from
Apollonius and Priscian, that proper names contain the meaning of
appellative names, but, unlike traditional grammar and what is claimed
by the <em>Glosulae</em>, Abelard thinks proper names do not
additionally contain the signification of individual accidents. The
fact that the proper name determines the same essential properties as
&lsquo;man&rsquo;, without signifying them, explains how
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; can be located in the category of substance
(<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 64, 33&ndash;65, 5) and how the
proposition &lsquo;Socrates is a man&rsquo; can be an essential
necessary proposition. This is because the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;
(<em>sensus</em>) of the &ldquo;formula&rdquo; corresponding to
&lsquo;man&rsquo; is included in the name &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;
(<em>Glossae Super Predicamenta</em>, p. 126, 37&ndash;127, 5; see
also <em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 72). And so essential qualities
take part of the meaning of proper names without being part of their
signification.</p>

<p>
Abelard does not deny that a bundle of accidents can be unique to one
individual and play a role in the way we identify this individual. But
the association of ideas between a proper noun and the accidental
qualities attached to an individual is explained on ontological
grounds, i.e., by the fact that the individual is the substrate of
accidents, in such a way that these accidents are indirectly
associated with the proper name. This has nothing to do with semantics
(<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 63, 8&ndash;30). Abelard describes this
kind of association by introducing a sense of
&ldquo;signification&rdquo; that has nothing to do with human
language, but is related to the notion of a natural sign, as a
dog&rsquo;s barking is a sign of its anger (<em>Dialectica</em>, pp.
112 and 114).</p>

<p>
Abelard offers a highly specific semantics of proper names based on a
logical analysis that is independent of grammatical theory, as well as
on a sharp distinction between semantic properties and real properties
(where individual substances always exist with particular accidents),
and, again, between semantic properties and subjective, psychological
representations, where individual, identifying accidents are always in
fact associated with the use of a proper name in everyday life.</p>

<p>
With respect to our intellectual grasp of the singulars to which
&lsquo;this man&rsquo; and &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; must correspond,
Abelard makes clear that it is an abstractive intellective cognition
in the sense that it isolates one feature (this man) from others (this
animal; this white) in a data complex represented by the underlying
subject of perception (<em>Super Porphyrium</em>, p. 27). Here we
encounter, through Boethian sources, what will later on, through
Aristotelian and Avicennian sources, be described as the distinction
between determinate and vague individuals (see &sect;5.1 below). The
underlying subject is the concrete individual with all its properties,
whether essential or accidental, from which the universal intellection
of man is also derived (<em>Glossae Super Predicamenta</em>, p. 142).
The signification of the intellection guarantees the permanence of the
signification of the words even if the things referred to no longer
exist (<em>Super Peri Hermeneias</em>, p. 309). This should also apply
to &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; and to &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, but Abelard
does not go further in his explanation of the function of the concepts
corresponding to demonstrative pronouns when the thing pointed to is
no longer present or existing.</p>

<h2 id="ProbPropNamePropNamiThirCentLogiPhil">4. The Problem of Proper Names and Proper Naming in Thirteenth-Century Logic and Philosophy</h2>

<h3 id="NewElem-2">4.1 Thirteenth-Century Innovations</h3>

<p>
We can select three genres where singular terms were addressed during
the thirteenth century: (i) terminist tracts, where singular terms
appeared as &ldquo;discrete terms&rdquo;; (ii) <em>sophismata</em>
literature, especially in the <em>sophismata</em> with
&lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;, as well as the use of &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; as
an example of a singular term in OHNEA <em>sophismata</em>
(&lsquo;Every man is necessarily an animal [<em>Omnis Homo de
Necessitate Est Animal</em>)]&rsquo;; and (3) commentaries on the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, in which a new question was raised, &lsquo;Can
particulars have a proper names?&rsquo;, a question also found into
other kinds of texts.</p>

<p>
Not every medieval text directly concerned with the signification of
singular terms endeavored to offer in-depth philosophical discussions
of them. This was true of two very influential grammatical treatises
from the second half of the twelfth century, namely the <em>Summa</em>
&lsquo;<em>Absoluta cuiuslibet</em>&rsquo; of a certain Peter of Spain
(not to be confused with the thirteenth-century author of the
<em>Summulae logicales</em>) and of the <em>Summa super
Priscianum</em> of Peter Helias. It applies even more during the
thirteenth century, when the prospect of a satisfying explanation of
the signification of proper names became more and more remote thanks
to a series of philosophical novelties. We can observe this trend
especially in Modistic treatises on grammar written from the 1260s on
(for Modism, see Rosier-Catach 1983; Marmo 1994), by authors such as
Michael of Morbais, Boethius of Dacia, John of Dacia, and Martin of
Dacia, whose positions about proper names signifying an essence as
existing in the singular together with individuating material
conditions appear close to that of Thomas Aquinas, but are not further
developed (see Brumberg-Chaumont, forthcoming-b).</p>

<p>
In addition to the issues raised during the first half of the twelfth
century, the semantic consequences of remarks in texts by Aristotle,
Avicenna, and Averroes, newly translated in the latter half of the
twelfh century and the beginning of the thirteeenth century, presented
a unique set of difficulties. First, the Aristotelian idea that
individuals have no essence or definition of their own, together with
the theory of individuation by matter (or by form and matter) &mdash;
as opposed to the twelfth-century theory of individuation by accidents
&mdash; seemed to imply that individuals cannot really be named as
individuals, or that proper names signify individuals only as
individuated by material circumstances, that is, as unknowable.
Second, the Avicennian theory of the three states of essence seemed to
force singular terms to signify the essence only as existing in the
sensible singulars. And third, the Averroist analysis of certain
semantic aspects of the <em>Metaphysics</em>, which had common names
signifying first the form and secondarily the aggregate or
&lsquo;<em>suppositum</em>&rsquo;, seemed to imply that singular names
signify the aggregate directly (see Ebbesen 2000; Pinborg and Ebbesen
1984; Brumberg-Chaumont 2005).</p>

<p>
In order to understand thirteenth-century logic, one has to consider
that, unlike the view held by most later logicians, some universal
propositions were viewed by many thirteenth-century masters as lacking
existential import. As a consequence, particular propositions (we can
see here why, following modern terminology, they should not be called
&lsquo;existential propositions&rsquo;) and even singular
propositions, if correctly inferred from a universal proposition in a
logical descent, also came to be seen as lacking existential import
&mdash; unless singular propositions were simply to be expelled from
any inference involving universal propositions. The latter option
would be bound to raise serious issues, since inferences from
universal to subordinated singular propositions formed the basis of
the theories of supposition and verification by logical descent, e.g.,
from &lsquo;Every man is an animal&rsquo; to &lsquo;Socrates (or this
man) is an animal&rsquo;, &lsquo;Plato (or that man) is an
animal&rsquo;, etc.</p>

<h3 id="SingTermTermLogi">4.2 Singular Terms in Terminist Logic</h3>

<p>
In terminist tracts, proper names are generally considered to be
paradigmatic &ldquo;discrete terms&rdquo;, a category that includes
proper names, pronouns, and expressions such as &lsquo;this
man&rsquo;. In a theory of referential variation in propositional
contexts, singular terms are paradoxically inserted as totally
invariant terms, since they generally have no mode of supposition
apart from discrete supposition. Some authors, such as William of
Sherwood (1230s/1240s), or William Arnaud in his commentary on Peter
of Spain&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em> (1290s) tried to argue that
singular terms (proper names) could have simple supposition as in
&lsquo;Socates is predicable of only one&rsquo;, but they were
confronted with great difficulties. Individual things have no
&lsquo;form&rsquo; for which the singular term could supposit in
simple supposition; the singular &lsquo;intention&rsquo; for which the
singular term supposits in simple supposition remains unexplained (for
further discussion, see Brumberg-Chaumont 2013b).</p>

<p>
Masters who insist on the semantic specificity of proper nouns assert
the identity of the significate, the <em>suppositum</em>, and the
<em>appellatum</em>, i.e., the existing thing. This doctrine is
supported by the best-known terminist textbook of the Middle Ages,
Peter of Spain&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em>, dating from the 1230s/1240s
(<em>Tractatus</em>, pp. 197&ndash;198). Peter also thought that
discrete terms only had discrete supposition. In his
<em>Syncategoremata</em>, he describes names such as
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; as temporary, &lsquo;as-of-now [<em>ut
nunc</em>]&rsquo; terms (<em>Syncategoremata</em>, pp. 296&ndash;298).
But this theory led to serious difficulties and sometimes incoherent
positions. Peter did not explain what happens when an existing
individual, which is the significate, <em>suppositum</em>, and
<em>appellatum</em>, disappears. In his source, a Parisian treatise
called the <em>Summule antiquorum</em>, proper names appear to change
their semantic structure depending on whether or not the individual
named exists; in the former case, the significate and the
<em>suppositum</em> are identical to the <em>appellatum</em>; in the
latter, the significate and the <em>suppositum</em> are identical, but
the <em>appellatum</em> is absent (see Anonymous, <em>Summule
antiquorum</em>, ed. L. M. de Rijk, p. 13). Furthermore, in yet
another passage of the <em>Tractatus</em>, Peter concedes the
possibility of inferring a subordinate singular proposition from a
universal proposition (&lsquo;Every man is mortal; therefore, Socrates
is mortal&rsquo; (<em>Tractatus</em>, p. 83), which presupposes that
the two propositions have the same truth conditions with regard to
existential import. However, he argues in the <em>Syncategoremata</em>
that inferences involving mixed modal absolute propositions, such as
&lsquo;Man is necessarily an animal&rsquo;, and <em>ut nunc</em>
propositions, as &lsquo;Socrates is a man&rsquo;, which are true for a
time, are fallacious (<em>Syncategoremata</em>, pp. 296&ndash;298).
Consequently, the mixed modal syllogism Barbara LXL
(necessary/assertoric/necessary), namely &lsquo;Every man is
necessarily a animal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is
necessarily an animal&rsquo;, which follows an LXL combination, viewed
as valid by Aristotle without restriction, should be considered
fallacious. This connects with the famous medieval sophismatic
proposition, &lsquo;Every man is necessarily an animal&rsquo;, where
this LXL syllogism systematically appeared in discussions.</p>

<h3 id="SophDiscSingTerm">4.3 Sophismatic Discussions of Singular Terms</h3>

<p>
The problem of the semantics of proper names appears in at least six
of the OHNEA &lsquo;Every man is necessarily an animal&rsquo;
<em>sophismata</em> catalogued by Ebbesen and Goubier (see Ebbesen and
Goubier 2011). Proper names are also discussed in <em>sophismata</em>
containing the proper name &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; (Brumberg-Chaumont
forthcoming-a)</p>

<p>
The aforementioned LXL syllogism was used to demonstrate that the
sophismatic proposition &lsquo;Every man is necessarily an
animal&rsquo; is false because it leads to the obviously false
proposition &lsquo;Socrates is necessarily an animal&rsquo; in a
correct deduction in which the second premise, &lsquo;Socrates is a
man&rsquo; is obviously true &ndash; from which it follows that the
major must be false. According to one strategy, defending the truth of
the major proposition involves exposing the argument as incorrect
(ill-formed; fallacious) because of the introduction of an <em>ut
nunc</em> proposition with a proper noun conceived as a
&lsquo;temporary&rsquo; (<em>ut nunc</em>) term, where you should have
only an &ldquo;absolute assertoric&rdquo; (<em>simpliciter de
inesse</em>) proposition in the minor position.</p>

<p>
The defense of the truth of sophismatic proposition using this first
strategy can be found in various sophismatic texts, especially one of
the earliest OHNEA <em>sophisma</em>, the Anonymus Erfordiensis, from
the 1240s (see De Libera, 2002, p. 232). It says that the LXL argument
is not valid, so it is not the case that the major must be false. This
is because the LXL combination is considered valid only on the
condition that the assertoric minor proposition is absolute
(<em>simpliciter</em>), not as-of-now (<em>ut nunc)</em>. The way the
condition is explained suggests that it is impossible to combine
as-of-now propositions not only with absolute necessity propositions,
but also with any absolute proposition, even assertoric ones, such as
&ldquo;every man is a animal&rdquo;. This reason is that mixing
as-of-now and absolute propositions makes the inference invalid or,
according to some authors, fallacious. This saves the truth of the
OHNEA proposition, but at an enormous logical cost.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, some masters developed another strategy for defending the
truth of the sophismatic proposition. Here the aforementioned mixed
modal syllogism is taken to be valid, so that proper nouns are no
longer described as temporary, but absolute, just like the term
&lsquo;man&rsquo; (see for instance the Anonymus Liberanus, ed. in De
Libera 2009, p. 221; Anonymus Alani 13, ed. in Gazziero and De Libera
2008, pp. 361&ndash;362). When logically analyzed, the proper noun
with its individual dimension is eliminated, as it becomes equivalent
to the name of the species to which the individual belongs; thus,
&lsquo;Socrates is a man [<em>Socrates est homo</em>]&rsquo; becomes
the identity statement, &lsquo;man is man [<em>homo est
homo</em>]&rsquo;. Paradoxically, some masters viewed singular
propositions as even more necessarily true and devoid of existential
import than universal propositions such as &lsquo;Every man is an
animal&rsquo;. This theory amounts to the logical elimination of
proper names. Similar ideas appear in the discussion of the
sub-<em>sophisma</em> &lsquo;Caesar is a man, Caesar being dead
[<em>Caesar est homo, Caesare mortuo</em>]&rsquo; in the Anonymus
Liberanus. The idea that individuals do not have a name or a
definition as a consequence of their having no form of their own is
clearly formulated here. The truth of the proposition &lsquo;Caesar is
a man&rsquo; is not jeopardized by an empty term because the
significate of &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; is the same, whether Caesar exists
or not (Libera 2009, p. 230).</p>

<p>
Discussions of the role of proper nouns in this <em>sophisma</em> can
also be found outside the sophismatic literature. This is the case in
Robert Kilwardby&rsquo;s commentary on the <em>Prior Analytics.</em>
His aim was to exclude proper names from modal syllogistics by
treating them as &lsquo;temporary [<em>ut nunc</em>]&rsquo; names.
According to Kilwardby, proper names are not to be subordinated to
universal terms such as &lsquo;man&rsquo; and therefore should be
eliminated in favor of terms that enable the formation of truly
subordinate propositions, i.e., particular propositions constructed
with terms such as &lsquo;some man&rsquo;. &lsquo;This man&rsquo; is
inadmissible for the same reason (Robert Kilwardby, <em>Notule Libri
Priorum</em>, p. 326).</p>

<h3 id="MetaPropNamePartHavePropName">4.4 The Metaphysics of Proper Names: Can Particulars have Proper Names?</h3>

<p>
A third kind of discussion is found in commentaries on
<em>Metaphysics</em> VII. A distorted Latin translation and
interpretation of a remark at 1035b1&ndash;3 seemed to make Aristotle
say, &ldquo;particulars do not have a proper name [<em>particularia
enim non habent proprium nomen</em>].&rdquo; This reading echoed
Aristotle&rsquo;s suggestion in the same passage that individuals lack
an essence and definition of their own. And so the question arose,
&lsquo;Do particulars have real/proper names?&rsquo;, which is found
in at least five <em>Metaphysics</em> commentaries from the thirteenth
century, by Richard Rufus of Cornwall, Adam of Bockenfield, Roger
Bacon, Geoffrey Aspall, and Richard Clive. It is also found in other
texts, such as an important anonymous pre-Modist commentary on
<em>Priscian Major</em> (Ps-Robert Kilwardby), Roger Bacon&rsquo;s
<em>De signis</em>, Siger of Brabant&rsquo;s commentary on <em>De
anima</em>, Robert Kilwardby&rsquo;s commentary on <em>Isagoge</em>,
Henry of Ghent&rsquo;s <em>Lectura ordinaria</em>, and Albert the
Great&rsquo;s <em>De intellectu et intelligibili</em> (see
Brumberg-Chaumont 2005 and Brumberg-Chaumont forthcoming-a).</p>

<p>
The question asked by Geoffrey Aspall in his <em>Metaphysics</em>
commentary (1250s), &ldquo;Do particulars have real names?&rdquo;, can
be understood in three senses: &lsquo;Do particulars have
names?&rsquo; &mdash; obviously they do; &lsquo;Do particulars have
names of their own?&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Do particulars have names that
would properly be names?&rsquo;. Geoffrey answers: &ldquo;individuals
do not properly have names. There are in fact two ways in which
anything can have a name. Either this name is imposed from a form by
signification, so that signification is not the same as appellation
&ndash; this is what it means to have a proper name (i.e. to be
properly a name), and it is this name that the universal possesses
&ndash; or else it is imposed by appellation, and it is this name that
the particular possesses. In the latter case, the significate and the
<em>appellatum</em> are the same, and so the particular does not
properly have a name&rdquo; (Geoffrey Aspall, <em>Quaestiones in
Metaphysicam</em>, ed. in Brumberg-Chaumont 2005, p. 102). The
arguments in favor of the existence of proper names for particulars,
which Geoffrey accepts, mostly defend the existence of singular
intellectual knowledge of individuals by reflection (via the
imagination, as in the later theory of Thomas Aquinas), which means
that the noetic argument against the existence of proper names cannot
be upheld. But the problem remains because, for Geoffrey, intellection
is not the significate of the name; rather, it is the form, following
Averroes&rsquo; interpretation of the semantic theory implied in the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, whereby names signify the form primarily, and
secondarily the aggregate. Since there is no form for individuals, the
latter cannot properly be named. Geoffrey&rsquo;s solution means that
individuals do have ordinary proper names, but not logically proper
names, i.e., names that are truly proper names for individuals and
truly names. In his commentary on the <em>Isagoge</em> (<em>Notulae
super Porphyrium</em>, provisional edition, courtesy of Alessandro
Conti), Robert Kilwardby also says that the individual does have a
proper name (<em>proprium nomen</em>), but does not properly have a
name (<em>proprie nomen</em>), i.e., a true logical name established
on metaphysical grounds. This distinction will also be at the heart of
the theory proposed by John Buridan in the following century.</p>

<h2 id="BuriTheoSingTermInfl">5. Buridan&rsquo;s Theory of Singular Terms and its Influence</h2>

<p>
The fourteenth century witnessed a fresh start on the topic of
singular terms, due to some major innovations: the birth of a
nominalist logic, the notion of a mental language, and the idea that
individuals are intellectually knowable as individuals &mdash; an idea
defended by Ockham in his theory of intuitive cognition, after an
initial breakthrough provided by John Duns Scotus and his theory of
haecceity (see SEP &ldquo;Medieval Theories of Haecceity&rdquo;).
However, Ockham&rsquo;s logic offers only a sketchy account. Spoken
proper names seem to not have any corresponding singular simple
concepts to which they could be subordinated in mental language
because the corresponding concept becomes universal as soon as the
individual known is no longer present to the knower. In order to
address this, Claude Panaccio has provided a reconstruction of
Ockham&rsquo;s semantics where it is mental concepts that are
subordinated to oral terms in such cases (see Panaccio 2006 (2017)).
As for pronouns, they are supposed to be eliminable in mental language
even though they play a crucial role, distinct from the one played by
proper names. As &ldquo;direct designators&rdquo;, pronouns would be
meaningless for Ockham according to Panaccio. Faced with the problem
of descent from universal to demonstrative singular propositions,
Ockham would say that if the subject term is empty (because no
individual man is designated), the singular proposition is not a
proposition subordinated to the universal proposition (see Panaccio
1980).</p>

<p>
John Buridan offers a quite different picture, in which each type of
singular term &mdash; &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; &mdash; is thoroughly discussed. The
Parisian master produced the most complete and coherent account of
singular terms in the Middle Ages and through this exerted a great
influence on logic and semantics in the following centuries.</p>

<h3 id="BuriSingTermConc">5.1 Buridan on Singular Terms and Concepts</h3>

<p>
In his commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De anima</em> (III/8),
Buridan claims that &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, which signifies what he
calls a &ldquo;vague individual&rdquo;, is the most proper singular
term. Buridan&rsquo;s view of vague individuals was related, as was
Avicenna&rsquo;s original discussion (see Black 2011), to
Aristotle&rsquo;s claim in <em>Physics</em> I (184a22&ndash;24) that
in cognition we proceed from universals to particulars: first we
cognize this body, then this animal, then this man (the vague
individual), then Socrates (the determinate individual, with all his
particular accidental characteristics). The vague individual is just
the perfectly individually identified individual, without taking into
account all his individual accidents. Indeed, Buridan says that for
the vague individual to be &lsquo;vague&rsquo; is just &ldquo;a way of
speaking&rdquo;, since it corresponds to a face-to-face (<em>in
prospectu</em>) intellectual cognition. His account allows recognition
of both the primacy of singulars and of the move from what is more to
what is less general. It depends on Buridan&rsquo;s epistemological
claim that general notions are always involved in apprehension. This
has led many scholars to formulate the idea that what makes an
apprehension singular is the confusion or fusing together of
circumstances, so that being a man is not something abstracted from
what exists here and now in such and such a way. Singularity is not
tied to the absence of generality, but rather to the presence of
confusion or lack of discrimination. A concept can be semantically
simple and singular but at the same time metaphysically rich (see
Miller 1985; Van der Lecq 1993; King 2001, Ashworth 2004a, Klima
2009). In the case of demonstrative <em>in prospectu</em> concepts,
i.e., those involved in the use of indexicals, Buridan often refers to
&ldquo;place&rdquo; (<em>situs</em>) as the characteristic that
accompanies the intellection, making it confused and singular.</p>

<p>
John Dorp rejected Buridan&rsquo;s account, arguing that there is no
singular term corresponding to a vague individual in our language.
Instead, cognizing a thing as singular involves the cognition of
particular circumstances, and the general concept [man] cannot be part
of the singular cognition. If we want to introduce vague singulars
into our language, we will have to invent some special term, such as
&lsquo;a&rsquo;, to signify Socrates along with a connotation of all
the individual circumstances, in which case &lsquo;a&rsquo; will count
as a vague singular (<em>Compendium</em>, sig. e 1, va-vb).
Dorp&rsquo;s view was not popular. For most later logicians, the vague
singular was (<em>contra</em> Dorp) one type of singular term, but
(<em>contra</em> Buridan&rsquo;s claim in the <em>De anima</em> III/8)
it is less properly singular than a proper name because it involves
some generality.</p>

<p>
While it is true that the term &lsquo;this man&rsquo; can lack
reference through improper use, if it is used properly it must point
to one singular existing present object, the very situation in which
we form genuinely singular concepts. If it is used without an
individual being present, the expression will just not be significant
because the pronoun &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; will no longer be
significant (Buridan, <em>Quaestiones in Porphyrii</em>, p. 161, or
else it will make the proposition false if the individual pointed to
is a stone &mdash; see below). The term &lsquo;this man&rsquo; used
several times for different individuals does not make it a common
term, but each use is equivocal because a different individual is
designated by each token of &lsquo;this man&rsquo; (Buridan, <em>In
metaphysicen</em>, VII/19, f. 53va). The fact that an individual is
being demonstrated here and now means that &lsquo;this man&rsquo; is
more circumscribed in its proper usage, such that it is always
time-bound.</p>

<p>
Proper names are a different story. Proper names are sometimes said to
be the <em>most</em> proper singular terms by Buridan for this reason
(<em>Quaestiones in Porphyrii</em>, p. 162). Buridan remarks that if
Socrates leaves the room, he is still Socrates, but he is no longer
the referent of &lsquo;this man&rsquo; (<em>In Metaphysicen</em>
VII/18, f. 53rb). Nevertheless, there are also strict limitations on
the use of proper names. Proper names are singular insofar as the
concept to which they correspond is itself singular. In his
<em>Quaestiones</em> on the <em>Metaphysics</em> VII/20, Buridan
considers the names &lsquo;Antichrist&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo;, arguing that &lsquo;Antichrist&rsquo;, the
example of a name referring to a person who does not yet exist, is not
a singular term because it is formed from &lsquo;anti&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Christ&rsquo; and could apply to more than one individual.
There are two possiblities where &lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo; is concerned.
If I am in the presence of the individual and I dub him
&lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo;, then the name is a genuinely singular term.
But if Aristotle is for me merely an historical figure from the
distant past, then my concept of Aristotle must be descriptive,
containing general elements such as <em>man</em>, <em>great
philosopher</em>, <em>born in Greece</em>, and so on. Given that there
was in fact only one such man, my concept supposits only for Aristotle
and so the stability and uniqueness of my reference is guaranteed.
However, since the corresponding concept is not and cannot be
singular, it seems that &lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo; cannot be a proper
singular term when it is uttered by me. Every description is bound to
be universal for Buridan, even if it pragmatically permits us to
identify and re-identify a single individual (see Ashworth 2004a;
Klima 2009, p. 69&ndash;89). Most of the proper names we articulate
would thus not be singular terms, but only disguised descriptions.
Buridan is keen to say that proper names do not pick out their
referents according to any descriptive content (<em>Quaestiones super
octos libros Physicorum</em>, p. 69). No one can bestow a singular
concept upon another person by definition or explanation. As a
consequence, the use of proper names as real singular terms also seems
quite limited.</p>

<p>
Buridan also considers a third case concerning isolated pronouns such
as &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo;. One pending issue is then the way the
pronoun combines with &lsquo;man&rsquo; in &lsquo;this man&rsquo;. As
seen above, &lsquo;<em>hic&rsquo;</em> in Latin is always a
demonstrative pronoun. If the expression &lsquo;this man&rsquo; is
complex, then its significate would depend on the significate of two
categorematic terms, &lsquo;this[one]&rsquo; and &lsquo;man&rsquo;,
and the supposition would be their intersecting set &mdash; an idea
actually defended by Buridan in some texts (see <em>Quaestiones in
Porphyrii</em>, p. 160; <em>In metaphysicen</em> VII, 19; adopted by
Klima 2009, p. 103). If, on the other hand, the expression is simple,
as seems to be required by Buridan&rsquo;s theory of substantial
singular terms (see Brumberg-Chaumont 2016), then the pronoun would be
treated as a syncategorematic term. But this solution is inconsistent
with the fact that pronouns can be used by themselves to refer to
individuals. The latter theory was indeed not adopted by Buridan,
though it was articulated by Dorp, who hypothesized the unformulated
presence of sortals associated with pronouns used in this way (see
Ashworth 2004a). Ockham also had a syncategorematic interpretation of
pronouns (see Panaccio 1980).The case of pronouns was not a side topic
for Buridan, since they are at the heart of his logic, providing the
basis for the analysis of the supposition and verification of all
other terms (see Brumberg-Chaumont 2016). When used by themselves,
pronouns have the same requirement regarding the presence here and now
of their referent as expressions such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, and,
consequently, they seem to have the same very limited use.</p>

<p>
An additional difficulty arises from the fact that singular terms such
as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; need to be non-connotative terms in the
category of substance in order to play their fundamental role in
supposition and verification (see <em>Summulae de
suppositionibus</em>, p. 16, 23, 31; Brumberg-Chaumont 2016). This
applies not only to proper names such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; and
expressions such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, which are officially
listed by Buridan as singular simple terms in the category of
substance, signifying the individual &ldquo;without any extrinsic
connotation&rdquo; (<em>Quaestiones in predicamenta</em>, p. 9;
<em>Quaestiones Libri Porphyrii</em>, p. 169), but also to pronouns,
as the basis for any chain of categorial predication. As noticed by
Peter King (King 1994, p. 26), Buridan thought that pronouns signify
the substance alone, without any properties (<em>In metaphysicen</em>
VII/19). This was in keeping with the grammatical tradition, and it
suggested that pronouns signify substances as substances, beyond
simply referring to substances. This point presents a problem,
however, namely the possibility of the existence of a concept that
would be both singular and non-connotative in the category of
substance (there are few absolute terms in the category of accidents;
an example would be &lsquo;whiteness&rsquo;). This possibility seems
to be precluded by the standard interpretation of Buridan&rsquo;s
theory of intellectual cognition described above, in which a there is
a necessary connection between distinction and universality on the one
hand (which explains why sensory cognition cannot be universal), and
confusion and singularity on the other hand. Applied to
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, this would mean that if the proper name were
to signify the determinate individual described in Buridan&rsquo;s
<em>De anima</em> III/8 (as suggested by King 2001, p. 16, Reina 2002,
p. 220&ndash;255), i.e., an individual substance with all its
accidental features, then the corresponding concept would all its
individal accidents. Applied to the demonstrative <em>in propectu</em>
cognition corresponding to &lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; and the vague
individual &lsquo;this man&rsquo;, this would mean that the
corresponding concepts would contain at least the aspect of place
(<em>situs</em>), which is definitely an accidental property according
to the <em>Categories</em>. Every singular term would then be a
connotative term &mdash; an idea quite disastrous from the point of
view of Buridan&rsquo;s logic.</p>

<p>
Answers to each of these difficulties can in fact be found in
Buridan&rsquo;s works.</p>

<h3 id="ExteUsesSingTermNonConnNonRichSingConc">5.2 Extended Uses of Singular Terms and Non-Connotative (Non-Rich) Singular Concepts</h3>

<p>
A first element is the fact that the <em>in propectu</em> cognition is
a richer notion than the knowledge of something as presently
demonstrated here and now, as implied by the special case of deictic
expressions (<em>Quaestiones in Porphyrii</em>, p. 160&ndash;161).
Contrary to Ockham&rsquo;s intuitive cognition, Buridan&rsquo;s <em>in
prospectu</em> concepts admit situations where individuals are not
physically present, but seen in dreams (where they can even be
fictitious) or remembered by the knower (<em>In metaphysicen</em>
VII/20). Once you have had an <em>in prospectu</em> cognition of the
individual named, you can use the proper name, whether the individual
is present to you or not. With regard to the <em>in prospectu</em>
knowledge attached to the use of proper names, Buridan often speaks of
<em>in propectu</em> knowledge &ldquo;<em>according to the mode</em>
of existing in front of the knower&rdquo; (see for instance <em>De
anima</em> III/8; see Miller 1985, Van der Lecq 1993, Reina 2002, pp.
198 ff., King 1994, King 2001, Klima 2009, pp.74&ndash;86;
Mora-M&aacute;rquez 2019). A further extension of the use of proper
names is possible. As shown by Jennifer Ashworth (Ashworth 2004a),
Buridan admits the possibility of using proper names in connection
with the impositor&rsquo;s singular cognition &mdash; rather than
one&rsquo;s own cognition. Buridan remarks that I can treat
&lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo; as a singular term because I believe that the
name was imposed or given its signification by someone who did have
the appropriate singular concept (<em>In metaphysicen</em> VII/20). If
I have never been acquainted with Aristotle but I am speaking with
someone who is, we can both be taken to be using a proper name when we
utter the word &lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo;. Buridan&rsquo;s remarks can be
analyzed in at least two closely related ways. On the one hand, given
his references to an original baptism or name-giving ceremony, we can
regard Buridan as offering an early hint of the historical chain
theory of proper names developed by Kripke. On the other hand, given
his apparent recognition that the speaker&rsquo;s intention to refer
to the person so named is related to a body of information which,
whether accurate or not, is causally connected with the person
baptized as &lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo;, perhaps Buridan&rsquo;s view is
closer to the causal account given by Gareth Evans. As Gyula Klima
puts it, the appeal to the &ldquo;second user&rdquo; is
&ldquo;parasitic&rdquo; on the &ldquo;primary user&rdquo; (Klima 2011,
p. 68). Buridan&rsquo;s hints were picked up, though not developed, by
later authors. For instance, Dorp remarked that we treat
&lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo; as singular because it was singular for the
original impositor.</p>

<p>
The importance of some sort of causal link between the original
producer of the name and the named individual as well as its relation
to the representative nature of singular concepts was brought out by
Buridan and Dorp in their discussion of two cases. In the first case,
Plato and Socrates are exactly similar but, without my knowing it, one
replaces the other in my field of vision. Buridan (<em>Quaestiones
super octos libros Physicorum</em> I/7, <em>In metaphysicen</em>
VII/17) and Dorp (<em>Compendium</em>, sig. e 2rb) argue that while my
first-formed singular concept is equally similar to both individuals,
i.e., Plato and Socrates, it is not a concept of Socrates (the second
individual) because it is caused by a different individual. The
criterion of distinction is not the fit between concept and object but
the causal relation. The second case was discussed by Dorp alone
(<em>Compendium</em>, sig. e 2rb). If identical twins are born and
both are called &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, it may seem that
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; will thereby function as a common name because
the two concepts will be exactly alike. But here too the causal
relation is what is important, and so for Dorp this is an example of
two singular terms, each with its own signification (see Asthworth
2004a, p. 138).</p>

<p>
An extended use can also be envisaged for pronouns, whether occurring
alone or in expressions such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo;. A passage from
the commentary on the <em>Metaphysics</em> (<em>In metaphysicen</em>
VII/19) shows that Buridan accepts and indeed, for the sake of the
coherence of his logical theory, encourages the idea that pronouns
could be used by someone to refer to something that <em>could</em> be
designated by pointing. This de-indexicalized use of pronouns is
mobilized by Buridan in specific philosophical contexts, such as when
Aristotle says that primary substances signify &lsquo;this
something&rsquo; (<em>hoc aliquid</em>). The point is very important,
because Buridan believes that if taken &ldquo;in the proper
sense&rdquo; (<em>de vitute sermonis</em>), any inference from a
universal proposition to a subordinate proposition with a singular
term such as &lsquo;this man&rsquo; is invalid, because the antecedent
can be true and the consequent false, such as when I point to a stone
(<em>In metaphysicen</em> VII/19, f. 53vb). Logical and philosophical
uses of language are contexts in which you should admit
de-indexicalized uses of pronouns, that is, uses connected to the
<em>potential</em> designation of a thing by someone (whether by
myself or another speaker), &ldquo;as if [something] were to be shown
by someone [about which] she could truly say, &lsquo;this thing is a
this something&rsquo; (<em>si ab aliquo esset demonstrata ipse posset
dicere vere &lsquo;hec res est hoc aliquid</em>&rsquo;)&rdquo; (for
further discussion, see Brumberg-Chaumont 2016).</p>

<p>
What about the connotative nature of singular terms and concepts? It
should be said here that proper names are probably not to be generally
described as signifying &ldquo;determinate individuals&rdquo;, as
suggested by the reading of <em>De anima</em> III/8. This idea, which
is simply incompatible with Buridan&rsquo;s rejection of descriptive
content in the standard analysis of the semantics of proper names, is
avoided by Gyula Klima&rsquo;s interpretation (Klima 2009, pp. 111
ff.) . In addition, the arguments derived by the standard
interpretation against the existence of a concept that would be both
singular and non-connotative (not rich) can be overcome by looking
more closely at another passage from Buridan&rsquo;s commentary on the
<em>Metaphysics</em> (<em>In metaphysicen</em> VII/17). Here Buridan
says that a single substantive feature inside the complex of data
contained in an intellection based on <em>in propectu</em> knowledge
can be isolated from accidents, including place. Buridan&rsquo;s
solution for &ldquo;substantial terms in the category of
substance&rdquo; (<em>termini substantiales de predicamento
substantie</em>), whether singular or universal, is the following:
&ldquo;Because the intellect can detach (<em>absolvere</em>) the
concept of the subject from the concept of an accident, when we impose
[a term], we can have the intention to detach it, so that the term
does not connote the accidents.&rdquo; This applies to singular
substantial terms in the category of substance: &ldquo;A purely
singular concept needs the thing to appear in front of (<em>in
prospectu</em>) the one who knows. In this way, someone who knows
forms an individual concept of the substance [on the one hand] and of
the accidents [on the other], and can impose a singular name [on each]
in an independent way&rdquo; (<em>In metaphysicen</em> VII/17, f.
50ra-rb). This solution explains how one can consider the individual
substance on its own without the cognition being turned into a
universal concept. As a substantial name in the category of substance,
a proper name can be imposed only according to this isolated feature,
i.e., &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; can be imposed on Socrates as a
substance, irrespective of the other features he presents to the
intellect. The concept and the corresponding term can both be singular
and substantial. The isolation being appealed to here does not mean
that we end up with an abstract concept, detached from the <em>in
prospectu</em> cognition (otherwise it would not be singular anymore),
but rather, it is isolated <em>within</em> the <em>in prospectu</em>
cognition (for further discussion, see Brumberg-Chaumont 2016). Very
interesting discussions on the same topic are found in Marsilius of
Inghen and Thuo of Vitborg (Bos 1999). The same kind of solution can
and indeed must go for demonstrative concepts corresponding to
&lsquo;this man&rsquo; and &lsquo;this[one]&rsquo;. This would explain
why Buridan says that pronouns do not signify substance with
accidents, despite the fact that substances always appear with
accidents in demonstrative <em>in prospectu</em> cognitions (if only
with the accident of place). If proper names can sometimes be
associated with individualizing accidents attached to a single
individual (as suggested by <em>De anima</em> III/8), this does not
mean that the proper name <em>signifies</em> such accidents. The name
can be imposed on individual substances only as designated by
&lsquo;this [one]&rsquo; (as in, &ldquo;let this one be named
&lsquo;Socrates&rdquo;), the demonstrative term being a substantial
singular term based on a substantive singular concept in which even
place has been removed from consideration.</p>

<h3 id="PropNameIdenThroTime">5.3 Proper Names and Identity Through Time</h3>

<p>
In the last redaction of his commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Physics</em> (I,10), Buridan asks the question &ldquo;Is Socrates
the same today that he was yesterday?&rdquo;, with important
consequences for proper names. In his answer, Buridan carefully
distinguishes between three kinds of numerical identity through time,
a strictest sense (God), a strict sense (for individuals unified by a
rational soul such as Socrates) and a less strict sense (for bodies
and other realites like rivers). A consequence of Buridan&rsquo;s
account is that names such as &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Aristotle&rsquo; on the one hand, and the river
&lsquo;Seine&rsquo; and &lsquo;Browny&rsquo; the donkey on the other,
have a different status. The former are more properly singular terms
than the latter, even for those acquainted with these individuals
through time. Domingo de Soto was strongly opposed to this
consequence. He appeals to Aristotle in order to argue that continuity
of soul is not the only criterion for identity of the second type, and
that horses, trees, and even rivers could possess this stronger
identity by virtue of the continuity of their forms and functions,
which is the basis on which a singular concept is applied to them over
time. Another consequence of Buridan&rsquo;s account is found in some
early sixteenth-century logicians who adopted an even more restrictive
account of proper names (see Astworth 2004a, pp. 139&ndash;140). These
logicians argued that a sequence of different concepts of Socrates
will be formed over time, even by one acquainted with him, and hence
the name &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; is no more a proper singular term than
the name &lsquo;Seine&rsquo;. Names are radically equivocal, since at
every moment they are subordinated to different concepts. Nor is this
incompatible with the intention of the person who originally gave
Socrates his name. Strictly speaking, only the baby was called
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;, but the name was imposed equivalently or as a
consequence to signify every successor to the boy by means of
different concepts. Once more, Domingo de Soto (<em>Summule</em> ff.
18vb-19rb) was strongly opposed. He said that to regard the name
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; as an equivocal term referring to a succession
of individuals is a rejection of common speech and the common sense of
the wise men who originally gave such terms their signification.
Identity of the second type is sufficiently strong to be the basis for
a singular concept to be predicated non-ambiguously over time.</p>
