<p>
The concept of information is widely used in the biological sciences.
Informational concepts are central to molecular biology, where it is
standard to talk about translation, transcription, proofreading,
redundancy, DNA libraries, the genetic code, genetic editing, or the
genetic program. Genes are also meant to carry information about our
evolutionary past. Information is a key notion in cognitive science;
cognitive systems are said to trade on information, which is connected
to talk of mental representation, neural signals, neurotransmitters,
and so forth. The same is true of animal communication, where signals
are usually understood as information carriers; calls, colors, shapes,
or scents carry information about predators, food, or identity.
Hormones also work as signals and trigger signaling pathways within
the cell. Changes in the transmission of information has also been a
key topic in macroevolution. In biology, the centrality and influence
of informational talk is hard to exaggerate.</p>

<p>
This pervasive use of the notion of information raises a range of
interesting questions. Do all these expressions refer to the same or
to different entities? What is the nature of information? Can it be
measured? Is informational talk purely metaphorical or should we take
it at face value? Are informational concepts illuminating, or should
they be dispensed with? Does information play a substantive
explanatory role? What determines the informational content of a
signal? Should we be realists about information? Can it be reduced to
some other property? This entry will address some of these
questions.</p>

<p>
These issues have often been addressed in the context of specific
debates, where many of the details are relevant to the different
arguments and positions. Nonetheless, some recurring themes can also
be identified. This entry begins with some general questions
 (<a href="#ConcInfo">&sect;1</a>);
 we will discuss correlational
 (<a href="#CorrInfo">&sect;1.1</a>)
 and teleological
 (<a href="#TeleInfo">&sect;1.2</a>)
 senses of information and we will briefly consider anti-realist and
eliminativist challenges
 (<a href="#AntiRealElim">&sect;1.3</a>).
 We will then move to two specific debates where information has
played a central role: molecular biology
 (<a href="#GeneInfo">&sect;2</a>)
 and animal communication
 (<a href="#AnimComm">&sect;3</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ConcInfo">1. The Concept of Information</h2>

<p>
As with many other expressions that derive from ordinary language, the
concept of information is employed in different ways in the biological
sciences. Sometimes informational concepts are used for a purely
external matter, i.e., in a sense that reveals our epistemic use
rather than any property of the object. For instance, when differences
in allele frequencies are said to carry information about the
evolutionary past (e.g., to infer the phylogenetic distance between
two species), it is not assumed that the cell or the organism uses or
exploits this information; rather, the suggestion is that we can use
allele frequencies to discover certain facts. It is an inferential
rather than an explanatory use of information. Understood this way,
genes carry information in the same way an unearthed bone carries
information about an extinct species, tree rings carry information
about the age of a tree and redshift carries information about the
expanding universe.</p>

<p>
Very often, however, informational talk ascribes some specific
property to biological entities, which does not primarily capture an
epistemic property of our practices. The claim that neural spikes
carry information seems to attribute them some sort of aboutness; when
molecular biologists assert that codons code for certain amino acids,
they seem to be ascribing some kind of instructional content, which
somehow tells the transcription and translation machineries how they
should proceed. That alarm calls carry information about predators
does not seem to depend on our epistemic practices. Prima facie, these
uses attribute a specific objective property, rather than merely
revealing something about what can learn from them. This is the sense
of information on which most attention has been centered, and is the
focus of this entry.</p>

<p>
As a first approximation, information in this sense may be
characterized as asymmetric, normative, and non-ubiquitous. Animal
communication provides a clear example: information is asymmetric in
the sense that, whereas a vervet monkey&rsquo;s alarm carries
information about an approaching snake, the snake itself does not
carry information about the call. Information is also typically
normative: it can be accurate/inaccurate, true/false, or satisfied/not
satisfied. If no snake is actually approaching, the signal would be
false or inaccurate. Finally, information is not ubiquitous in two
respects: first, whereas some animal traits carry information, not all
of them do; second, those that do only carry information about a
restricted set of facts. Of course, this is just a baseline
characterization suggested by biological practice. Whether this
analysis is accurate or whether it should be expanded, reduced, or
completely abandoned in general or in specific cases is one of the
central issues at stake.</p>

<p>
A significant amount of effort has been expended in developing a
concept of information that accommodates these features and clarifies
the use of informational concepts in biology. In this section we will
consider a specific way of understanding this notion that derives from
Shannon&rsquo;s mathematical theory, as well as richer concepts
inspired by this view. We will then move on to teleological
approaches, which seek to overcome some of the difficulties of
previous accounts, and we will finally consider some alternative
views, which try to combine the insights of different approaches into
a coherent whole.</p>

<h3 id="CorrInfo">1.1 Correlational Information</h3>

<p>
A first strategy to further characterize the use of information in the
biological sciences appeals to Shannon&rsquo;s (1948) mathematical
theory of information. Shannon was primarily interested in a design
problem, namely how to decide the optimal coding to minimize errors in
communication. He sets out the problem very abstractly
 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>):
 given a particular state of the <em>source</em>, a <em>sender</em>
transmits a message to a <em>receiver</em> through a <em>channel</em>,
which might introduce some noise. The designer has to devise the
optimal coding system that allows the receiver to correctly recover
the state of the source with as little error as possible on
average.</p>

<div class="figure nobr" id="fig1">

'Information source' with arrow to 'Transmitter' (combo labeled Message) with arrow labeled 'Signal' to an unlabeled node with another arrow labeled 'Received Signal' with arrow to 'Receiver' with arrow to 'Destination' (last two also labeled 'Message'). A node below labeled 'Noise Source' has an arrow to the unlabeled node in the middle." src="figure1.svg" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>
To address this problem, Shannon recovered and refined the concept of
information, which other theorists such as Nyquist or Hartley had
already used before: in Shannon&rsquo;s characterization, the quantity
of information at the source can be roughly understood as the amount
of order (or, more precisely, its entropy). Intuitively, the amount of
information reflects the uncertainty of the actual state of the source
given all possible states in which it could be. Sources with many,
equally likely states are associated with a high degree of uncertainty
(information). From this idea, one can define the concept of mutual
information: two event spaces carry mutual information iff the state
of one of them alters the probability distribution of the other. In
other words, mutual information can be understood as measuring to what
extent knowing the actual state of one variable reduces the
uncertainty about the other. The greater the mutual information, the
more accurately the original message can be reconstructed. How much
information exists between these systems depends on how much, on
average, the probabilities are changed by the state of the system.
Hence, mutual information captures the average amount of information
being transmitted and is fully determined by the statistical
association between them. Mathematically, mutual information is
defined in terms of the joint probability distribution describing the
state space. This is why Shannon&rsquo;s concept of mutual information
is sometimes called &ldquo;correlational information&rdquo; (note,
however, that Shannon&rsquo;s approach includes some measures, e.g.,
entropy or surprise, that are not about correlations).</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly, genes, alarm signals, or neural spikes carry information
in that sense. However, many doubt that this concept can fully capture
the relevant property attributed in actual scientific practice. As we
saw, a common way to characterize the concept of biological
information suggests it as asymmetric, normative, and non-ubiquitous,
while correlational (Shannon) information has none of these features.
First, correlational information is symmetrical: if <em>A</em> carries
information about <em>B</em>, then <em>B</em> carries information
about <em>A</em>. If the states of two event spaces are statistically
correlated, the correlation goes in both directions. Second, it is not
normative, in the sense that it does not seem to have truth or
accuracy conditions; the information <em>A</em> carries about
<em>B</em> depends on the actual statistical correlation between them
and there is no clear sense in which this correlation can be false or
inaccurate. Third, information is also ubiquitous: on the usual
interpretation of
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>,
 there is no restriction on the kind of entities that can play the
role of source, channel, etc. Thus, almost any physical system carries
information and, indeed, it carries a large amount of it. As a result,
many think that the relevant concept of biological information cannot
straightforwardly be understood in terms of Shannon&rsquo;s approach.
This is so much so that correlational information (understood
<em>&agrave; la</em> Shannon) is standardly contrasted to semantic
information.</p>

<p>
Recently, however, different strategies have been employed to rescue
some elements of Shannon&rsquo;s theory of information and develop
accounts inspired by these ideas. On the one hand, some authors have
questioned the clear-cut distinction that has usually been assumed
between Shannon and semantic information. Mann (2020), for instance,
argues that Shannon&rsquo;s approach already provides a theory of
semantic information (see also Isaac 2019; Mart&iacute;nez 2019).
Other researchers have developed correlational approaches that go
beyond Shannon&rsquo;s measure in different ways (Pocheville 2018;
Scarantino 2015). Scarantino (2015), for instance, develops a
probabilistic difference-maker account inspired by both Shannon
information and Bayesian decision theory, which is based on which
states have had their probabilities changed, how much the
probabilities have changed and what are the posterior probabilities.
Pocheville&rsquo;s (2018) proposal combines Shannon mutual information
between interventions and their effects, which captures causal
specificity, and Kolmogorov complexity, which reflects the complexity
of a sequence and the algorithmic mutual information between two
sequences. In Pocheville&rsquo;s account, the symmetry of mutual
information is broken by appealing to interventions (see also Calcott
et al. 2020).</p>

<p>
An alternative (although, as we will see, related) approach studies
information and signals by employing formal tools provided by
evolutionary game theory (for an introduction, see Skyrms 2010;
O&rsquo;Connor 2020). For our purposes, the most relevant games are
so-called &ldquo;signaling games&rdquo; (see Alexander 2002 [2021]).
In a nutshell, these game-theoretic models typically include two (or
more) players, some of whom play the role of &ldquo;senders&rdquo; and
others the role of &ldquo;receivers&rdquo;. The world can be in
different states, which the sender observes and sends a signal. The
receiver observes the signal (it cannot observe the world directly)
and performs an action. Finally, there is a payoff for the sender and
for the receiver, which depends on which action is performed in a
given world state. Since there are different signals to choose from,
senders and receivers could follow different strategies to coordinate
their actions.</p>

<p>
These highly idealized models have been used to study many properties
of signaling. For instance, it has been shown that in a game with two
players, two world states, two signals, two actions, and common
interest between players, signaling systems are not only Nash
equilibria (a set of strategies where no individual can unilaterally
deviate and improve its payoff), but constitute the only attractors,
in the sense that any interacting players that start to play any other
strategy will tend to approach one of these two equilibria (Huttegger
2007; Bruner et al. 2018). In short, this means that, in these models,
communication necessarily evolves. Thus, these models show that the
emergence of signaling does not presuppose intelligence either on the
part of sender or receiver. Huttegger (2007) also argues that if world
states differ in probability, then players might sometimes converge to
a <em>pooling equilibrium</em>, where they always send the same signal
(irrespective of the observed world state) and always perform the same
action. One can also modify the game in different ways: changing the
number of states, signals, or actions; considering continuous, rather
than discrete, values (O&rsquo;Connor 2014); adding more players
(Skyrms 2009, 2010); considering scenarios of partial or complete
conflict of interest (Mart&iacute;nez &amp; Godfrey-Smith 2016) and so
on. There is a growing body of literature on these models, which have
been used to defend interesting claims in these and related areas.</p>

<p>
These models also offer a new view of information. Skyrms (2010)
provides a measure for the informational content of a signal, which is
a vector specifying how much the signal changes the probability of
world states (in this context, &ldquo;changing probabilities&rdquo;
should not be understood as the signal causally affecting the world,
but in technical sense of a difference in probability between the
occurrence of the world state given the signal, as opposed to the same
world state without the signal). Suppose the world could be in four
equiprobable states: S1, S2, S3, and S4. If signal <em>M</em> is sent
only in S1 and S3, <em>M</em>&rsquo;s information content would be
\(\langle 1, \infty, 1,-\infty\rangle\), because it increases the
probability of S1 and S3 in 1 bit each (\(-\infty\) is just due to
taking the logarithm). If instead <em>M</em> is sent only in S3,
<em>M</em>&rsquo;s information content would be \(\langle -\infty,
-\infty, 2,-\infty\rangle\). Skyrms&rsquo; approach has been very
influential and has generated a range of proposals along similar lines
(e.g., Isaac 2019). Calcott, Pocheville, and Griffiths (2020) argue
that Skryms&rsquo; approach fails to capture information
<em>flow</em>, and develop an alternative account that interprets
signaling networks as causal graphs, according to which information
depends on how causally specific a signal is for an act. Shea,
Godfrey-Smith, and Cao (2018) take a pluralist approach and define two
notions of information: informational content, which captures the
probability of world states given the signal, and functional content,
which depends on how world states have played a role in the
stabilization of the signal. In a sense, functional content can be
understood as a way of modelizing a teleological theory of information
(see below and Godfrey-Smith 2020).</p>

<p>
Finally, some alternative proposals broadly inspired by
Shannon&rsquo;s approach analyze informational relations in terms of
counterfactuals. Birch (2014) defines the propositional content of a
signal as the information that it would carry in the nearest
separating equilibrium, i.e., the nearest equilibrium in which there
is a one-to-one mapping from world states into signals. Similarly, to
accommodate cases of deception, Skryms and Barret (2019) suggest that
a signal&rsquo;s content is determined by the subgame in which sender
and receiver have common interest. From a different perspective, Cohen
and Meskin (2006) argue that <em>x</em>&rsquo;s being <em>F</em>
carries information about <em>y</em>&rsquo;s being <em>G</em> if and
only if the counterfactual conditional &ldquo;if <em>y</em> were not
<em>G</em>, then <em>x</em> would not have been <em>F</em>&rdquo; is
non-vacuously true (for a classic version of counterfactual theories
of content, see Fodor 1987).</p>

<p>
With respect to this wealth of different statistical concepts of
information, one can take different attitudes. On the one hand, it
could be argued that one of them is the right way to specify the
nature of biological information. Alternatively, one could go
pluralist and accept that different concepts are useful in different
contexts or for different explanatory purposes (e.g., Shea,
Godfrey-Smith, &amp; Cao 2018). Yet a different option is to hold
that, whereas some of these concepts might have some epistemic
utility, none of them capture the nature of biological information.
One way to motivate this view is to insist that none of these concepts
capture a sense of information that is asymmetric, normative, and
non-pervasive. Furthermore, as these approaches are defined over
simplified models, they have the virtue of being very precise, making
predictions and providing a measurable concept of information, but
their connection with actual cases of communication becomes less
direct and more questionable.</p>

<p>
Be that as it may, two claims are hard to deny. First, the concept of
correlational information, as well as the work on these models, has
been extremely useful in understanding different aspects of biological
information. Second, whatever one thinks of the nature of biological
information, probabilistic relations are important for human and
non-human animals, so understanding how we exploit it is an important
research project (Millikan 2004; Stegmann 2015).</p>

The most prominent alternative framework for analyzing the concept of
biological information that goes beyond correlational information
appeals to the notion of biological function (Millikan 1984). The
concept of function offers a promising starting point because it
possesses the three features characterizing semantic information: on
the one hand, it is normative; a trait&rsquo;s function is an effect
that the trait is supposed to have, and failure to carry it out
entails the trait is malfunctioning or functioning wrongly. The idea,
then, is that the distinction between truth/accuracy and
falsity/inaccuracy could eventually be explained as some form of
malfunction. Furthermore, functions typically are asymmetric: an
essential function of blinking is spreading tears across the eye, but
not vice versa. Finally, functions are mostly (perhaps exclusively)
attributed to certain traits of living beings, and only some effects
of each trait qualify as its functions, so they are not ubiquitous.
So, one could seek to analyze carrying semantic information in terms
of having a function (cf. Maynard-Smith 2000). Unfortunately, despite
these virtues, this simple proposal is unlikely to succeed, since many
functional traits fail to possess semantic information in any relevant
sense of the term. Hearts are supposed to pump blood, but they
don&rsquo;t play an informational role. Thus, something else needs to
be added.</p>

<p>
One strategy resorts to <em>senders</em> and <em>receivers.</em>
Interestingly, one of the original motivations for the sender-receiver
framework comes from communication theory and, in particular,
Shannon&rsquo;s approach; a second classic source is Lewis&rsquo;s
(1969) account of conventions. In a nutshell, the key idea is that
information emerges in the interaction between two (or more) agents or
mechanisms: the sender perceives some aspect of the world and sends a
signal, and the receiver acts onto the world on receiving it. The role
of sender and receiver can be played by whole organisms, but also by
parts of organisms or other mechanisms. In principle, senders and
receivers could be defined in causal terms, so the analysis is not
circular. The roles of &ldquo;sender&rdquo; and &ldquo;receiver&rdquo;
are usually described at a very abstract level, which is of course
useful if one is trying to find a shared structure between all
informational systems (as, presumably, was Shannon&rsquo;s original
motivation).</p>

<p>
An appeal to senders and receivers raises a whole range of interesting
issues. Which kind of entities (other than organisms) can play the
role of senders and receivers? Different answers to this question have
been important, for instance, in the context of genetic information
and, as we will see below, different views on the nature of senders
and receivers lead to different views on genetic information (for a
parallel discussion in neuroscience, see Cao 2012 and Artiga 2016). A
different question concerns whether both senders and receivers are
always required. Some authors develop their views purely in terms of
senders (e.g., Neander 2017), whereas others exclusively appeal to
receivers (Fresco, Ginsburg, &amp; Jablonka 2020; Jablonka 2002;
Stegmann 2009). A third issue is: what determines informational
content? Some think content is primarily determined by past use by the
receiver (Millikan 1984), while others embrace a producer-based
approach (Neander 2017; Schulte 2018). Framing informational relations
in terms of senders and receivers, however, is not devoid of risks:
Godfrey-Smith (2014) warns of a tendency to force a sender-receiver
interpretation onto any interaction that seems to involve
informational relations.</p>

<p>
In any case, despite the prominent role teleological theories play in
the debate, this approach has been the target of significant
objections. In general, teleological views of biological information
inherit not only the virtues, but also the difficulties of
teleological approaches in general (see entry: teleological notions in
biology). Thus, problems related to the different (and incompatible)
ways of analyzing the concept of function, as well as the classic
problems, should also be taken into account in providing a fully
satisfactory theory of biological information. Among others, this
includes worries related to potential sources of functional
indeterminacy, as well as the well-known Swampman problem: if a
lightning bolt strikes a swamp and creates, by sheer luck, an exact,
molecule-by-molecule duplicate of Donald Davidson, none of his states
could carry information according to teleological theories, since they
would lack the right kind of evolutionary function. Many regard this
consequence as unpalatable.</p>

<p>
Partly for these reasons, there is a growing tendency to provide
hybrid accounts that combine functional elements with correlational
information, as well as other resources. Bergstrom and Rosvall (2011)
suggest that if we view Shannon information as a result of a decision
process, rather than as a correlation measure (which, among other
things, implies appealing to functions), then we can find some sort of
asymmetry and avoid the objection of promiscuity. Lean (2014) argues
Shannon&rsquo;s approach needs to be supplemented with the distinction
between carrying information and having the function to do so. In the
context of cognitive science, Neander (2017) and Shea (2018) develop
accounts that include functions, correlational information as well as
other features such as a structural correspondence. Mart&iacute;nez
(2019) supplements a teleological approach with various notions of
communication theory, such as rate distortion functions (see also Mann
2020). Hybrid accounts are sometimes conceived as adding some elements
to a purely correlational account, while at other times they aim to
show that these seemingly new features were actually implicitly
contained in a mathematical theory of information. In any case, hybrid
accounts provide a rich avenue of future research.</p>

<h3 id="AntiRealElim">1.3 Anti-Realism and Eliminativism</h3>

<p>
So far we have mostly focused on views that take informational talk at
face value and seek to specify in more detail the nature and
explanatory value of biological information. Some philosophers and
biologists, however, have adopted an alternative perspective. We will
briefly consider here criticisms along two dimensions: the
realism/anti-realism divide and eliminativism. They roughly correspond
to the following questions: Does &ldquo;information&rdquo; refer to a
real property, which plays certain causal and explanatory roles, or is
it merely a useful fiction? Should we keep and promote its use in the
biological sciences, or should we rather discourage it?</p>

<p>
First, it is important to distinguish the question of realism about
information from the classic debate on realism about representations.
Indeed, it is possible to be a realist in one debate and not in the
other: for instance, informational eliminativists in the animal
communication debate typically accept the existence of signals (e.g.,
Rendall, Owren, &amp; Ryan 2009). Conversely, some critics of
postulating mental representations embrace the concept of information
(e.g., Chemero 2009). Although the two debates are obviously related,
our question specifically concerns information and, in particular,
semantic information (the existence of Shannon information is not
generally put into question).</p>

<p>
Most approaches we have discussed so far adopt a realist attitude,
since they take semantic information to be a genuine property carried
by some states, and which plays certain causal and explanatory roles.
Indeed, most realists are also reductionists, in the sense that they
hold semantic information can be explained in more fundamental terms
(e.g., by appealing to correlations, functions, sender-receiver
structures, and the like).</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, other views have also been defended, although their
prominence depends heavily on the area. Non-reductionist realism in
the context of genetic information seems to be suggested, for
instance, by Williams (1992: 10&ndash;13) and Dawkins (1995: 4),
although these metaphysical views have rarely been defended in detail
from a philosophical perspective. Likewise, views that one could
(roughly) classify as instrumentalist have been defended in molecular
biology (e.g., Sarkar 2000) as well as in neuroscience, where it is
usually connected to instrumentalism about representations (Sprevak
2013; Cao 2022). Levy (2011) defends a fictionalist view of
information in biology, according to which the concept of information
is a <em>liminal</em> metaphor, i.e., &ldquo;one that operates near
the threshold of the noticeable&rdquo;, but which nonetheless plays a
genuine role in biological understanding.</p>

<p>
Parallel to discussions about realism/anti-realism is the question of
whether we should keep and promote their use in the biological
sciences, or rather discourage it. One can typically find
eliminativist positions in every debate related to the concept of
information. As we will see, these positions have been defended in the
context of genetic information (e.g., Griffiths 2001) or animal
communication (Rendall et al. 2009), although they represent marginal
positions in the field. In contrast, in cognitive science,
eliminativism about semantic information has some support, and has led
to an important and long-lasting debate (Chemero 2009; Hutto &amp;
Myin 2013, 2017).</p>

<p>
As suggested above, many of the issues surveyed in this first section
are developed in more detail in specific debates. Thus, to delve
further into these issues and understand better how the concept of
information plays out in different areas of biology, let us
concentrate on two different areas: genetic information and animal
communication.</p>

<h2 id="GeneInfo">2. Genetic Information</h2>

<p>
As suggested above, informational concepts play a prominent role in
molecular biology, where it is standard to talk about translation,
transcription, proofreading, redundancy, library, the genetic code,
genetic editing, or the genetic program. Information has also been
crucial in developing the &ldquo;central dogma&rdquo; of molecular
biology and connects with highly disputed issues such as the
challenges put forward by developmental systems theory, epigenetics,
or the concept of innateness. Thus, it is one of the key areas where
the debate on semantic information has flourished.</p>

<p>
When addressing the question of genetic information, a first caveat is
that the very notion of a gene is fraught with complexities (see
Meunier 2022 [2023]). Whereas in classical genetics a gene is
typically defined as a difference-maker for a phenotypic difference, a
molecular gene is a strand of DNA (Falk 1986; Griffiths &amp; Stotz
2013). Additionally, the function of DNA in general needs to be
distinguished from the function of a particular section of DNA. Genes
also play a variety of roles; while some of them code for proteins or
amino acids, others play a regulatory role and, in this sense, might
be more aptly described as readers, rather than mechanisms carrying
information. Genes are sometimes said to be the messages, and other
times the sources of information (Godfrey-Smith 1999). These
metaphysical issues on the nature of genes may have important
consequences for one&rsquo;s interpretation of informational talk.
Nonetheless, for simplicity, we will leave them aside as far as
possible.</p>

<p>
Now, why attribute biological information to genes in the first place?
Genes play a crucial role in the development of organisms, as well as
in the inheritance of characteristics between individuals. Let us
first briefly describe the key aspects of the transcription and
translation processes, which illustrate the central role of
informational concepts and might help understand some of the the
details of the discussion. The process of gene expression includes
various entities and steps: DNA is a macromolecule composed of four
nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A], and thymine [T]),
a sugar and a phosphate group, structured in the form of a double
helix. In the process called &ldquo;transcription&rdquo;, some DNA
sequences are copied into &ldquo;messenger RNA&rdquo; or <em>mRNA</em>
(with the exception that thymines, T, are replaced with uracils, U).
Then, mRNA is changed in various ways (e.g., RNA splicing) and
transported outside of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Once mRNA
reaches the ribosome, this macromolecule chains together amino acids,
following the sequence in the mRNA, in a process labeled
&ldquo;translation&rdquo;. These chained amino acids form the building
blocks of protein molecules.</p>

<p>
A central aspect in this process of manufacturing a protein is the
existence of a so-called &ldquo;genetic code&rdquo;, which maps
triplets of RNA sequences (<em>codons</em>) to amino acids (although
some codons do not code for amino acids, but indicate <em>start</em>
and <em>stop</em> functions). For instance, the RNA sequence CGT maps
onto the amino acid <em>arginine,</em> and AGT maps onto
<em>serine</em>. Deciphering the genetic code was a crucial step in
the development of genetics and molecular biology. The genetic code is
combinatorial, and it is often claimed to be (in a sense to be
elucidated) arbitrary. This suggests that some steps in this process
are analogous to symbolic phenomena. The code is also highly specific:
each triplet codes for a specific amino acid, although different
triplets can code for the same, as there are 64 possible combinations
of triplets and only 20 amino acids (in this sense, the genetic code
is said to be <em>degenerate</em>).</p>

<p>
The attribution of information to genes is often connected to a more
specific claim. According to the so-called &ldquo;Central Dogma&rdquo;
of molecular biology, genetic information flows only in one direction,
from DNA to RNA, to protein (see &Scaron;ustar 2007). In its original
formulation, from Crick (published in 1958):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>The Central Dogma</strong>. This states that once
&ldquo;information&rdquo; has passed into protein <em>it cannot get
out again</em>. In more detail, the transfer of information from
nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid to protein may be
possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein to
nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the
<em>precise</em> determination of sequence, either of bases in the
nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. (1958: 153,
emphasis in the original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In turn, some appeal to this dogma to vindicate and explain one of the
leading ideas of contemporary biological research, namely the idea
that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited (Weismannism)
(Maynard Smith 2000; Sarkar 1996). Thus, the use of informational
notions in molecular biology has a variety of motivations, some of
which lie at the core of one of the key assumptions in contemporary
biology. As a result, the question of whether genes carry information
is intermingled with the question of whether it plays some privileged
evolutionary or developmental role.</p>

<p>
For our purposes, it might be useful to distinguish two different
claims. A first idea is that genes carry information. To defend this
suggestion, one needs to show that some respectable notion of
information can vindicate the appropriateness of expressions like
&ldquo;coding&rdquo;, &ldquo;genetic program&rdquo;,
&ldquo;transcription&rdquo;, &ldquo;translation&rdquo; , etc.
Fulfilling this goal might also require identifying some causal or
explanatory role for information to play.</p>

<p>
A second and different claim that usually goes hand in hand with the
previous, is that genes play some <em>distinctive</em>,
<em>special</em>, or <em>privileged</em> explanatory role that
distinguishes them from many other mechanisms involved in development
or inheritance. Much of the interest in debating the question of
genetic information derives precisely from this alleged privileged
explanatory role. Biologist Maynard Smith (2000), for instance,
defended both claims and boosted a renewed interest in this question
(see Godfrey-Smith 2000a; Maynard Smith 2000; Sarkar 2000; Sterelny
2000). Note, however, that the two claims are independent: one could
hold that genes play some unique explanatory role in development
without relying on informational concepts (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2000b;
Austin 2015), or accept that genes carry information without assuming
that this singles them out in any special way (e.g., Sarkar 2000).</p>

<h3 id="CritInfoMode">2.1 Criticisms of Informational Models</h3>

<p>
Informational approaches have been criticized from different
perspectives (e.g., Griesemer 2005). One line of criticism stresses
that once genes are seen as informational, the other causal factors
tend to be regarded as mere enabling conditions for the expression of
this information. The information view strongly supports the idea that
genes control and direct development, while other factors remain in
the background. Indeed, informational models have been compared to
preformatism (e.g., Oyama 1985; Moss 1992). In its classic form,
preformatism holds that organisms develop from miniature forms of
themselves, thus development is understood as growth. As a result,
rather than explaining how organized and differentiated adults develop
from less organized and differentiated cells, preformatism denies the
phenomenon. Likewise, critics argue, informational models often
suggest a similar picture of development: the supposition that a piece
of DNA contains the instructions for building a hand does not actually
explain how the hand develops, yet it fosters the false intuition that
an explanation is being offered (Lehman 1970: 34). Moreover, critics
continue, viewing genes as some sort of special or privileged causal
factor has provided a basis for the classic distinction between
&ldquo;innate&rdquo; and &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; characteristics,
&ldquo;nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;nurture&rdquo;, and the like, which
has had pernicious effects (Oyama 1985). Others have been more
critical of the very idea of genetic information. Sarkar (1996), for
example, draws on the development of molecular biology in the 60s and
70s to argue that &ldquo;information&rdquo; is a &ldquo;metaphor that
masquerades as a theoretical concept&rdquo;, which provides a
misleading picture of possible explanations in molecular biology (see
also Griffiths 2001).</p>

<p>
The criticisms of the movement known as developmental systems theory
(DST) have been especially influential (Oyama 1985; Griffiths &amp;
Gray 1994; Griffiths &amp; Knight 1998). DST theorists have advanced
the so-called &ldquo;parity thesis&rdquo;, according to which</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the roles played by the many causal factors that affect development do
not fall neatly into two kinds, one exclusively played by DNA elements
the other exclusively played by non-DNA elements. (Griffiths &amp;
Gray 2005: 420)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although genes play an indispensable role in development, so do many
other developmental mechanisms. For instance, many of the mechanisms
composing the epigenetic inheritance system, such as the DNA
methylation patterns, membranes, or organelles, produce resemblances
between parents and offspring and work in parallel to nuclear and
mitochondrial machinery. Thus, they argue genes are not privileged in
any respect. Certainly, genes might sometimes have a reliable set of
effects, given a specific set of environmental factors, but also
environmental factors might have a reliable set of effects, given a
specific set of genes. This view is heavily influenced by
Lewontin&rsquo;s (1974, 2002) criticism of the idea that we can
normally distinguish the causal responsibility of genes from the
contributions of environmental factors in the production of phenotypic
outcomes.</p>

<p>
The parity thesis has been the focus of much criticism. One response
is to admit that genes are one set of causes among other equally
necessary factors, while nonetheless identifying a set of features
that make genes distinct or special in some respect. Sterelny, Smith,
and Dickison (1996) argue that the informational role of genes is
distinctive, but not unique; many other developmental mechanisms that
possess functions (song learning, food preferences,
centrioles,&hellip;) also carry information. Furthermore, some of them
have been ignored due to an exclusive focus on DNA. Shea (2007, 2011)
accepts Griffiths&rsquo; parity thesis, but doesn&rsquo;t think that
accepting that genes carry information implies that many developmental
factors do, since only inheritance systems can carry semantic
information as part of their function. Stegmann (2012) argues that the
&ldquo;parity thesis&rdquo; can be defined in different ways; some of
them are unproblematic, but also trivial (e.g., genes as well as
environmental factors are on a par in the sense that they are both
causes), while others are much more controversial. The challenge for
those using the parity thesis is to come up with a plausible but
interesting sense in which genes and other environmental factors are
on a par. In more recent works, Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz reject
strong versions of the parity thesis and accept that nucleic acid
plays a distinctive role as a protein template and that the heredity
of nucleic acid was the key innovation that allows the transfer of
causally specific developmental factors from one cell to another
(Griffiths &amp; Stotz 2013; Stotz &amp; Griffiths 2017b).</p>

<h3 id="InfoApprGene">2.2 Informational Approaches in Genetics</h3>

<p>
Partly in response to these criticisms, there have been various
attempts to develop an account of genetic information that can clarify
and underpin its theoretical role. On the one hand, although genes
undoubtedly carry correlational information in Shannon&rsquo;s sense,
many hold that this notion is unsuited to vindicating a special
explanatory role; among other things, as we saw, information in that
sense is pervasive. Indeed, genes often correlate better, not with the
designed effect, but with dysfunctional outcomes: acorn genomes, for
instance, correlate better with rotting than with growing (Sterelny,
Smith, &amp; Dickison 1996; Griffiths &amp; Gray 1994). To address
this and other concerns, some recent proposals that rely on a
correlational sense of information tend to focus on the specificity or
causal profile of genetic material (Bourrat 2019; Calcott, Pocheville,
&amp; Griffiths 2020; Pocheville 2018). In recent work, Stotz and
Griffiths argue that causal specificity is connected to a form of
information. More precisely, drawing on previous work by Waters (2007)
and Weber (2006), they hold that a causal relationship is
informational when it is highly specific, and define this concept by
appealing to Woodward&rsquo;s interventionist approach to causation
(Griffiths &amp; Stotz 2013; Stotz &amp; Griffiths 2017a). Stegmann
(2014) adds that DNA is not only highly causally specific, but also an
<em>externally ordering process</em>, i.e., an external process that
controls every step in the process. According to him, this feature
might account for its distinct explanatory role and ground its status
as information carrier.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, one could avoid these worries by embracing a
teleological approach (Maynard Smith 2000). First, in contrast to
correlations, functions are not ubiquitous (e.g., environmental
features that are relevant for development, such as light or
temperature, do not have functions). Secondly, functions need not be
the most common effect, so even if an effect \(E_1\) is more frequent
than an effect \(E_2\), this does not imply that \(E_1\) must qualify
as its function. Nonetheless, as we saw, plenty of functional items do
not carry information in the relevant sense, so functions cannot be
the whole story (Shea 2007). To support the informational nature of a
strand of DNA, which could eventually be used to vindicate a
distinctive explanatory role, one has to develop a most elaborate
account, which might include (but not be exhausted by) biological
functions.</p>

<p>
Jablonka&rsquo;s (2002) proposal appeals to the function of the
receiver or interpreter (see also Fresco, Ginsburg, &amp; Jablonka
2020). According to her, an entity or process <em>S</em> carries
information when a receiver has an evolved response towards <em>S</em>
and variations in the form of <em>S</em> correspond to changes in the
receiver. Thus, recipes, alarm calls, a sequence of DNA, the length of
day, or the appearance of the sky carry information, as long as a
functional receiver exists. In this sense, information is conferred by
the interpreter (Jablonka 2002: 586). This is compatible with signals
being a special sort of information-carrying system, in which an
evolved sender also exists. In Jablonka&rsquo;s account, however,
despite the fact that genes carry information, they do not have a
privileged (informational or explanatory) status.</p>

<p>
Shea (2007) puts forward an alternative account. His proposal relies
on his own infotel-semantic account, which appeals to sender-receiver
systems and correlational information, although most of his insights
could also be embraced by other teleological theorists. First, among
traits with evolutionary functions, he focuses on inheritance systems,
which are systems whose function is to produce heritable variation.
DNA and its associated developmental machinery (cellular and
environmental factors) qualify as an inheritance system in this sense,
as it has the function of producing heritable phenotypes. In this
framework, the developmental system plays the role of receiver,
whereas DNA plays the role of an intermediate. An interesting feature
of his approach is that it does not rely on any specific feature of
DNA&mdash;e.g., on the specificity of coding or on its alleged
arbitrariness.</p>

<p>
Others have questioned the description of certain mechanisms as
senders and receivers in molecular biology. Levy (2011), for example,
argues there is no genuine sender for the alleged genetic information.
Similarly, Godfrey-Smith (2014) argues that the genome involves a
reader (the transcriptional and translational machinery within the
cell), but no clear sender, so genes might work as &ldquo;cues&rdquo;,
rather than as signals (on the cue/signal distinction, see
 <a href="#AnimComm">&sect;3</a>).
 He also explores how senders and receivers can vary along the
paradigmatic-marginal axis. In contrast, Calcott (2014) and Planer
(2014) argue that genes play the roles of senders and receivers, so
they are the mechanisms producing and reading information, rather than
carrying it.</p>

<p>
An additional property that is often mentioned to help characterize
genetic information is arbitrariness (Godfrey-Smith 2000a; Maynard
Smith 2000; Sarkar 2000; Sterelny 2000, Fox Keller 2009). This
concept, which relates to Monod&rsquo;s (1970) notion of
<em>gratuit&eacute;,</em> requires much more unpacking and remains
highly controversial; in Godfrey-Smith&rsquo;s terms (2000a: 205) it
is a &ldquo;useful if elusive concept in biology&rdquo;. Maynard Smith
(2000), for example, understands &ldquo;arbitrariness&rdquo; in
semiotic terms, as lack of necessity between form (chemical
composition) and meaning (genes being switched on and off); the clear
analogy here is with linguistic meaning, which is usually said to be
arbitrary in the sense that alternative sounds can represent any given
content equally well. Thus, the idea is that many mappings between DNA
bases and triplets would be possible, if the rest of the transcription
and translation machinery were modified accordingly. This relates to
Francis Crick&rsquo;s famous suggestion that the structure of the
genetic code is a &ldquo;frozen accident&rdquo;, one that was highly
contingent when it first occurred, but very difficult to change
afterwards. According to Maynard-Smith, the arbitrariness of the
genetic code is one of the central features that justifies an
attribution of genetic information and which singles it out a special
sort of cause.</p>

<p>
The concept of arbitrariness, however, is hard to make precise, and
many argue that standard ways of understanding this concept fail to
deliver a defining property of biological information (Stotz &amp;
Griffiths 2017a). One worry is that any relationship might look
arbitrary if there are enough causal links (Godfrey-Smith 2000a).
Stegmann (2004) develops an insightful criticism of some standard ways
of capturing the arbitrariness of the genetic code and argues that
most of them also apply to many other biochemical relations.
Nonetheless, he defends the genetic code being arbitrary, in the sense
that a codon requires certain chemical and structural properties to
specify an amino acid, but these properties are not determined by some
principle of chemistry. He also thinks this notion of arbitrariness
does not imply that genes carry semantic information. Lean (2019)
develops an account of arbitrariness in terms of what he calls
molecular &ldquo;adapters&rdquo;, i.e., mechanisms that couple two
properties that would be otherwise uncorrelated in such a way that
they work as intermediaries, rather than as cooperating causes. Planer
and Kalkman (2021) argue that there are two different concepts of
arbitrariness that are usually run together, party because human
language exemplifies both of them: one refers to the existence of
alternative structures that might have been used instead of the actual
signal and the other to the lack of resemblance between signal and
content.</p>

<p>
Three further distinctions are relevant in this debate. On the one
hand, an important distinction concerns <em>proximate</em> versus
<em>ultimate</em> information, depending on whether genetic
information constitutively depends on evolutionary history or not.
Teleological accounts typically assume the former, because they often
embrace an etiological theory of function, according to which function
depends on the effect being selected for (Millikan 1989; Neander
1991). Shea (2007) for instance, argues that genetic information
contributes to a phylogenetic explanation of adaptive complexity,
which differs from an ontogenetic one. In contrast, Griffiths (2016)
argues that genetic information must contribute to explaining
development, and ultimate information fails in this task: if two
organisms contain the same allele, one deriving from an ancestor and
the others appearing <em>ex novo</em> by mutation, both are in same
position to explain development, but only the former can have
information grounded in the evolutionary past (this is connected to
the Swampman problem; see
 <a href="#TeleInfo">&sect;1.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A second distinction concerns whether nucleic acids carry information
about some immediate causal product of DNA, such as mRNA or proteins,
or about phenotypes (understood as properties of the whole organism,
such as size, behavioral patterns, or shape). For instance, according
to some, genetic information concerns the production of amino acids or
proteins (Godfrey-Smith 2004), whereas others hold that it is about
phenotypes or environmental features (Shea 2007; Sterelny et al.
1996). Koiv (2020) defends the idea that some central claims of
teleological theories are incompatible with genes carrying distal
information about phenotypes. A related distinction concerns the
<em>kind</em> <em>of entity</em> genes carry information about;
Stegmann (2005), for instance, argues that genes carry information
about the <em>process</em> of synthesis (rather than about its
<em>products</em>), in the same way that a recipe for an apple pie
carries information about how to bake the pie, rather than about the
pie itself. He also suggests that the proximal product of DNA
transcription is RNA, rather than amino acids or proteins, so if one
really selects the proximal effect, not even proteins would be
represented.</p>

<p>
This point connects with an additional issue. Although so far we have
been assuming that information is descriptive (i.e., it is supposed to
tell how some part of the world is), information can also be
directive, i.e., tell how one should act in the world. This is
important, as many of those who accept that genes carry information
assume it is some sort of instructive (i.e., directive) content; as
Maynard-Smith (2000), suggests, &ldquo;it is a recipe, not a
blueprint&rdquo;. One reason for thinking content is instructive is
that proteins or phenotypes (the most plausible contents) are effects
of DNA synthesis and that DNA specifies, <em>in advance,</em> the kind
and order of operations that result in a particular product (Stegmann
2005). Furthermore, whereas it is clear which molecule or trait a gene
contributes to the production of, it is much less clear which
environmental feature it would descriptively represent. Godfrey-Smith
(1999) suggests that the content is directive, because if there is
some mismatch, the error lies in the interpreting mechanism, not in
the genes (so it has a world-to-mind direction of fit). On
Shea&rsquo;s view, genes are pushmi-pullyu representations (see
below), in the sense that they carry both indicative and directive
content. A gene coding for thick hair, for instance, would have the
content <em>the environment is cold, grow thick hair.</em></p>

<p>
In conclusion, nucleic acids uncontroversially carry correlational
information, but according to many this fact is unable to support the
special explanatory role that genes are supposed to play in
inheritance and development. Whether one can characterize an
alternative concept of information that is in position to underpin a
special or privileged explanatory role remains contested. Relatedly,
the result of this debate might have important consequences for
closely connected concepts, such as the idea of a &ldquo;genetic
program&rdquo; (see Moss 1992; Godfrey-Smith 2000b; Fox Keller 2001;
Baetu 2012; Planer 2014).</p>

<h2 id="AnimComm">3. Animal Communication</h2>

<p>
Non-human animal communication (&ldquo;Animal communication&rdquo;,
for short) is a growing area of research. Communication has been
established in many species, including frogs, ants, red deer, humpback
whales, elephant seals, and songbirds and takes many forms, ranging
from sounds and odors to behavioral patterns. Animal communication
raises a whole range of complex and interesting issues, such as the
nature of signals and meaning, the evolution of communication
(including language), signal reliability, or the relationship between
communication and cognition. In this section we will restrict our
attention to those aspects that are most directly related to the
notion of biological information.</p>

<p>
In communication, information is usually attributed to signals, but
again, the very notion of signal is somehow controversial. Signals,
like alarm calls and mating displays, are often distinguished from
cues, such as footprints. According to the most widely accepted
definition provided by Maynard-Smith &amp; Harper (2003: 3), a signal
is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
any act or structure which alters the behaviour of other organisms,
which evolved because of that effect, and which is effective because
the receiver's response has also evolved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Interestingly, this definition does not mention the fact that they
carry information, although Maynard-Smith &amp; Harper (2003: 3) make
clear that it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
follows [from that definition] that the signal must carry
information&mdash;about the state or future actions of the signaler,
or about the external world &mdash; that is of interest to the receiver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Others explicitly define signals in informational terms; for instance,
Otte (1974: 385) suggests that signals are &ldquo;behavioral, physiological,
or morphological characteristics fashioned or maintained by natural
selection because they convey information to other
organisms&rdquo;, and Bradbury and Vehrencamp (1998: 2) define
communication as the &ldquo;provision of information from a sender to a
receiver.&rdquo; In contrast, a cue is an act or structure used to gain
information about the world, but which it did not evolve to convey.
Both alarm calls and footprints might indicate the presence of a
predator, but only the former has evolved to convey this information
to a receiver.</p>

<p>
The close connection between animal signals and biological information
raises some important issues: How should &ldquo;information&rdquo; be
understood? What is the content of this information? Is there some
alternative framework for understanding communication that does not
appeal to this concept? What is the connection between an
informational perspective to communication and cognition?</p>

<h3 id="FuncRefe">3.1 Functional Reference</h3>

<p>
One of the first contemporary debates on animal communication took
place in the 1970s and 80s and concerned whether animal signals can
refer to objects and events in the external world, or whether they can
only indicate internal states or behavioral propensities (see Smith
1977: 77). Signals that have the function of informing the receiver
about world states, rather than about features of the sender, were
labeled &ldquo;functionally referential&rdquo;, because their
functional role was supposed to resemble words in human language
(Hauser 1996: 509). Part of the motivation for this debate came from
the widespread view that only humans can communicate about objects and
events in the world (see Allen &amp; Hauser 1993).</p>

<p>
Interestingly, even proponents of functional reference accepted that
signals also indicate or carry information about affective states,
individual identity, or subsequent behavior (Seyfarth, Cheney, &amp;
Marler 1980; Macedonia &amp; Evans 1993). This debate forced
contenders to reflect on the nature of signals and information. In an
influential paper, for instance, Macedonia and Evans (1993) defined
referential signals in terms of two properties: all eliciting stimuli
must belong to a common category (i.e., signal specificity or
&ldquo;production criterion&rdquo;) and that the presence of the
signal should be sufficient for producing the behavior in the absence
of the eliciting stimulus (&ldquo;perception criterion&rdquo;).
Eventually, empirical evidence and theoretical research leaned towards
the view that regards signals as functionally referential and, as a
result of this discussion, this position progressively became
mainstream in ethology.</p>

<h3 id="InflVsInfoAppr">3.2 Influence vs. Informational Approaches</h3>

<p>
Nonetheless, informational approaches to communication came under
attack from a different angle. As an extension of Dawkins&rsquo;(1976)
gene&rsquo;s eye view developed in the <em>Selfish Gene</em>, Dawkins
and Krebs (1978) proposed that signals should be seen as a mechanism
by means of which an individual exploits another animal&rsquo;s muscle
power. On this view, signals work as a means to manipulate receivers,
in the sense that the signal&rsquo;s function is to lead receivers to
behave in ways that benefit the sender, irrespective of whether it
also benefits the receiver:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Communication is said to occur when an animal, the actor, does
something which appears to be the result of selection to influence the
sense organs of another animal, the reactor, so that the
reactor&rsquo;s behaviour changes to the advantage of the actor.
(Dawkins &amp; Krebs 1978: 283).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Their criticism contained two key ideas. First, whereas the classical
etiological perspective assumed communication takes place between
cooperating organisms, Dawkins and Krebs stressed the role of the
sender&rsquo;s interests, and understood communication as a struggle
between an organism that seeks to influence and manipulate a receiver
and the resistance of the latter. Secondly, they argued that only
within a cooperative framework does it make sense to understand
communication as information transfer, and therefore put forward a
manipulationist paradigm, which eschews the notion of information.</p>

<p>
Since Krebs and Dawkins developed their criticisms on the assumption
that signals must presuppose cooperative agents, much research has
focused on explaining the reliability of communication and
disentangling the mechanisms underpinning its existence. Some
mechanisms have been proposed, such as kin selection, reciprocity, or
the famous handicap principle (Zahavi 1975), and so far all of them
presuppose that, on average, the receiver is at least partly
interested in engaging in communication (Wheeler et al. 2011). Thus,
in that respect, available evidence seems to point in the direction of
requiring at least partial common interest between sender and receiver
(although see Mart&iacute;nez &amp; Godfrey-Smith 2016).</p>

<p>
In a subsequent paper, Krebs and Dawkins (1984) clarified (or partly
modified) two important aspects. On the one hand, they admitted that
cooperation might be more common than their previous paper suggested.
If this is true, however, one wonders if describing communication as
manipulation, in which there is a &ldquo;manipulator&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;victim&rdquo; (which, in cooperative cases, plays the role of a
&ldquo;willing victim&rdquo;) might be misleading in many cases. On
the other hand, they do not seem to entirely reject an informational
perspective, but rather to downplay its importance; they eventually
express their view as the claim that information (understood not just
as correlation, but as semantic information; Krebs &amp; Dawkins 1984:
395) is <em>less important</em> or <em>pertinent</em> than
manipulation, or influence of persuasion (indeed, in Dawkins 2003:
97&ndash;103, he praises certain informational models). These ideas
have given rise to an interesting tradition that seeks to understand
signals as states that have some <em>influence</em> on receivers, and
according to which informational notions are inapt or, at least, much
less central than usually thought.</p>

<p>
More recently, work by biologists such as Rendall, Owren, and Ryan
follows this skeptical look at informational approaches and has
generated an interesting discussion (see, for instance, Rendall et al.
2009, and some responses: Font &amp; Carazo 2010; Ruxton &amp;
Schaefer 2011; Scarantino 2010; Scott-Phillips 2010; Seyfarth, Cheney,
Bergman, et al. 2010). First, they argue that very concept of
&ldquo;information&rdquo; is often ill-defined. Second, they suggest
that the exclusive focus on information (which, they argue, goes hand
in hand with a focus on honest communication) has led researchers to
overlook many aspects that influence signal design, such as perceptual
biases (Owren, Rendall, &amp; Ryan 2010). Frick, Bich, and Moreno
(2019) have also developed an influence-based account based on the
concept of organization, rather than evolution.</p>

<p>
Supporters of this tradition sometimes object to informational
approaches to communication on the grounds that they require senders
and receivers to trade on mental representations, akin to those
representations involved in human language exchange (Rendall &amp;
Owren 2013). Some have replied, however, that his objection is
unfounded, since informational researchers neither implicitly nor
explicitly assume that, say, bees, suricata, or black-capped
chickadees trade on representations resembling human cognitive
processes (Seyfarth, Cheney, Bergman, et al. 2010).</p>

<p>
In response, those sympathetic to an informational perspective have
argued that some aspects of research actually favor their approach. On
the one hand, assuming that signals carry information has been a
fruitful assumption for decades (Seyfarth, Cheney, Bergman, et al.
2010). Furthermore, it is in line with contemporary research on animal
minds, which assumes that cognitive capacities such as learning or
categorizing trade on information (Wheeler et al. 2011).</p>

<p>
Despite the agonistic way in which this debate is usually framed, one
might regard the two views as complementary, rather than conflicting
(Ruxton &amp; Schaefer 2011; Scarantino 2010; Stegmann 2013b; but see
Kalkman 2019). Whereas the influence approach can be very useful to
analyze many properties related to the <em>form</em> of the signal
(i.e., detectability, its relationship to receiver biases, etc&hellip;
) and can provide an illuminating perspective when there is
communication between organisms with a significant conflict of
interest, the informational approach might illuminate other aspects,
such as content, eliciting behavior, or the reliability and
maintenance of communication. For instance, whereas the complexity and
variability of mating songs in birds suggests that they probably carry
information about the quality of the singer, an important function
might also be precluding boredom and habituation (Searcy 1992;
Rendall, Owren, &amp; Ryan 2009). Each perspective might contribute to
gaining insights into a different aspect of communication. In any
case, this compromise sits uneasily with some of the claims of the
contenders, so it remains to be seen whether this is ultimately a
coherent, stable, and fruitful position.</p>

<h3 id="InfoAnimCommRese">3.3 Information in Animal Communication Research</h3>

<p>
As a matter of fact, nowadays most research on animal communication
assumes an informational (rather than influence) approach, where
signals can be functionally referential, which suggests a range of
important questions about the nature of signals and content.
Unfortunately, even though information is pervasively used, it is only
rarely defined. What is the best interpretation and explanatory role
of the concept of &ldquo;information&rdquo;, given current scientific
practice?</p>

<p>
Researchers often describe the concept of information as a
&ldquo;reduction of uncertainty&rdquo;, which suggests a correlational
concept of information (e.g., Seyfarth, Cheney, Bergman, et al. 2010).
Some works even explicitly use Shannon&rsquo;s theory of communication
to analyze certain aspects of communication with some precision, such
as channel capacity or the complexity of signal repertoire (Haldane
&amp; Spurway 1954; McCowan et al. 1999; Wilson 1962). Nonetheless,
when scientists provide an explicit definition of communication, most
of them resort to one of the standard definitions of signals
(Maynard-Smith &amp; Harper 2003; Searcy &amp; Nowicki 2005), which
define them in teleological terms (see above). In part, this is due to
the ubiquity problem with correlational information described in
 <a href="#CorrInfo">section 1.1</a>
 (Kalkman 2019). Thus, one way to describe the situation is that most
research actually assumes a teleological approach to the nature of
signals and information, whereas some of the tools and explicit
descriptions fit better a correlational concept of information.
Pfeifer (2006) and Sarkar (2013) put forward some objections to the
use of correlational information in animal communication studies. In
response, Mann (2018) provides an interesting analysis and defense of
the use of the mathematical theory of communication in this area. On
the other hand, work on decision theory provides a quantitative
measure of information that differs from Shannon&rsquo;s informational
approach, which is based on how signals change the prior probabilities
of certain events (Kight et al. 2013). This approach has heavily
influenced Skyrms (2010) and the subsequent literature relying on his
work reviewed above (see also Scarantino 2015).</p>

<p>
With respect to the standard, teleological approach to communication,
such as Maynard-Smith and Harper&rsquo;s (2003) widely used
definition, controversial points remain. For instance, Scott-Phillips
(2008) interprets Maynard-Smith and Harper&rsquo;s analysis in terms
of co-adaptation, which according to him is different and superior to
an information-based approach. In turn, Scarantino (2013) argues that
Scott-Phillips&rsquo; (and Maynard-Smith and Harper&rsquo;s) proposal
is too liberal unless one appeals to the concept of information, since
it misclassifies some cases of coercion as signals. So he develops his
Probabilistic Difference Maker Theory, which seeks to combine insights
from Shannon communication theory and Bayesian decision theory,
according to which the informational content of a signal is the
combination of incremental and overall support for all states
(Scarantino 2013, 2015). Whether this or similar approaches can solve
the liberality problem, however, is controversial (Kalkman 2019;
Artiga 2021).</p>

<p>
Interestingly, whereas in molecular biology (as in neuroscience) the
existence and nature of senders and receivers is fraught with
difficulties, animal communication has a very natural interpretation:
senders and receivers are organisms. Nonetheless, Stegmann (2009)
defends a receiver-based teleological approach, according to which
signal status and information entirely depends on the receiver (for a
response, Artiga 2014). Another controversial issue concerns the
cognitive complexity required by senders and receivers in pragmatic
aspects of communication (Bar-On &amp; Moore 2018).</p>

<p>
The content of animal signals also remains a contested topic of
research. An important question concerns whether the information
carried by animal signals is descriptive or directive. Millikan (1995,
2004) famously argued that many signals in animal communication are
what she called &ldquo;Pushmi-pullyu&rdquo; representations, i.e.,
signals that carry both descriptive and directive content at the same
time. This has been a very influential concept, applied to many
debates on representational content. On the other hand, an additional
perspective that has been gaining prominence in recent years (and
which has some connections with the classic debate on whether signals
are functionally referential) suggests that signals also possess
expressivist meaning (McAninch, Goodrich, &amp; Allen 2009). These
proposals are connected to a recent interest in pragmatic aspects of
communication and the origins of human language (Bar-On 2018).</p>
