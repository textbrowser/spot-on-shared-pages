<h1>Pragmatist Feminism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Aug 22, 2004; substantive revision Fri Mar 21, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Pragmatist feminism is a field of philosophy that emerged in the 1990s
as a new approach to feminist philosophy. It utilizes and integrates
core concepts of pragmatism, including its emphasis on pluralism,
lived experience and public philosophy, with feminist theory and
practice and a focus on social change. Pragmatist feminist
philosophers have been addressing several different projects over the
past decades, including a) the recovery of women who were influential
in the development of American pragmatism but whose work subsequently
all but disappeared in the history of philosophy, b) a rereading and
expanding of &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; pragmatist texts, including
analyzing traditional pragmatist texts from feminist perspectives, and
c) the utilization of pragmatist philosophies as a resource for
contemporary feminist philosophy and activism. The late
20<sup>th</sup> century saw a resurgence of interest in American
pragmatist philosophy, and part of the energy of that resurgence was
due to feminist interest in pragmatism. Twenty-first-century feminist
philosophers are incorporating a wider vision of American and global
activism into the pragmatist-feminist dialogue.</p>

<p>
What is now called &ldquo;classical&rdquo; American pragmatism is a
grouping of philosophies that developed between the late nineteenth
and the early twentieth century and were largely influential from the
Progressive Era (1890&ndash;1915) up until the Second World War.
Pragmatists, such as John Dewey, William James, and Jane Addams, were
interested in the intersection of theory and practice, bringing
philosophical thinking into relationship with the social and political
environment. For these thinkers, philosophizing was an active process,
both as a way to change social realities and to use experience to
modify the philosophies themselves. Early pragmatists were often
humanists; they saw the social environment as malleable, capable of
improvement through human action and philosophic thought. Because of
this, many of the classical pragmatists were engaged in social action,
often participating in experiments in education and working for
egalitarian social reforms. Both early and contemporary pragmatists
reject the idea of a certain Truth that can be discovered through
logical analysis or revelation and are more interested in knowledge
gained through a wide range of experiences while emphasizing the
social context of all epistemological claims. Pluralism is a central
value for pragmatists, who understand that knowledge is shaped by
multiple experiential viewpoints. As such, women&rsquo;s experiences
are an essential part of pragmatist philosophy.</p>

<p>
Feminism, as used here, broadly describes thinkers and activists who
are committed to the rights of women and non-binary people. Feminists
often begin with an awareness of one&rsquo;s physical and social
situatedness. Feminists reject body/mind dualism, understanding that
embodiment is a part of the epistemological process. Feminist writings
and movements tend to include an analysis of inequities around gender,
race, class, and ethnicity and seek to address systems of oppression.
</p>

<p>
The weaving together of feminism and pragmatism situates social and
political issues in historical, geographic, and relational contexts
and particularly addresses systems of oppression that have
marginalized the voices of women and people of color. Biographical and
theoretical approaches illuminate the connections between feminism and
pragmatism as activist-oriented philosophies. These efforts are
consistent with feminist methodology; they utilize personal
experiences as well as theoretical work that focuses on embodied
living in a social organism to address contemporary feminist social
and political concerns. </p>

<p>
Both feminism and pragmatism are fields that extend beyond the
boundaries of traditional philosophy. Looking beyond academic
philosophy to find the women who were influential social theorists and
activists has expanded traditional philosophical methodology and has
opened a new space for thinking in philosophy. Understanding these
reformers as philosophers helps us see how those outside of
professional academic settings developed, expressed, and enacted
groundbreaking theories and can illuminate how philosophers today
might span the boundaries between scholarship and activism, between
philosophy and other disciplines, and between the academy and the
community. As an expanding field, feminist pragmatism has become a
significant resource for theorists and activists working in the fields
of education, the environment, social science research, design theory,
community/urban planning, democratic social movements, legal theory,
food studies, and more.</p>

<p>
Although many of the historical women discussed here did not call
themselves pragmatists, contemporary scholars and activists rely on
their philosophies with a renewed emphasis on public and engaged
philosophy in the pragmatist tradition (Lake 2014; Hamington &amp;
Bardwell-Jones 2012; Varner 2021; Yun Lee 2011). This entry will first
consider the influence of particular women in the classical pragmatist
era, then highlight feminist rereadings of classical pragmatist work,
describing how contemporary pragmatist feminist philosophers are
drawing upon the work of early pragmatist feminist writers in order to
pursue projects within epistemology, education, social action, and
democratic pluralism. Finally, this entry will briefly consider
emerging contemporary scholarship from global pragmatist
feminists.</p>

<h2 id="EarlFemiContAmerPrag">1. Early Feminist Contributions to American Pragmatism</h2>

<p>
Women were significant partners in the development and articulation of
classical American pragmatism. Historical analyses bring into view the
lives of philosophers and activists such as Jane Addams, Mary Parker
Follett, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Emily Greene Balch, Lucy Sprague
Mitchell, Anna Julia Cooper, Mary Whiton Calkins, and Ella Flagg
Young. These women bring added dimensions to pragmatism; they remind
us of the issues that were subsequently left behind as American
philosophy became more exclusively technical and academic. For most of
these women, pragmatism was a philosophic practice used to accommodate
their new academic and political engagement with the world, as well as
a method of reforming politics and culture. The pragmatist approach to
philosophy that brought theory and practice together helped these
women trust in and learn from experience and intellectually engage in
a host of social reform movements.</p>

<p>
The historical recovery of female voices in the history of philosophy
in the last few decades is an ongoing project; it both helps us become
aware of women&rsquo;s influence on the history of philosophy and
shines a light on the processes that lead to the marginalization of
women&rsquo;s voices (see the entry
 <a href="../feminism-femhist/">feminist history of philosophy</a>).
 Recovering these women thinkers also allows us to hear new or
excluded voices in the philosophic conversation, in some cases
resulting in opening up the definition of philosophy itself.
Recognizing &ldquo;philosophical techniques are means, not
ends&rdquo;, these women rejected &ldquo;philosophizing as an
intellectual game that takes purely logical analysis as its special
task&hellip;&rdquo; (Seigfried 1996: 37). Because of the gender-based
discrimination against women as rational thinkers and their exclusion
from the academy, history has rarely carried the names and texts of
these women into our philosophy textbooks (see for example Eileen
O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s 1998 essay &ldquo;Disappearing Ink&rdquo;).
Thus, it should not be surprising that many of the women whose work
has been brought into the feminist-pragmatist discussion were
college-educated <em>activists</em> rather than professional academic
<em>philosophers</em>; nevertheless, scholarship has shown that their
work had an enormous impact on the development of pragmatist thought.
A historical look at how these women affected what became known as
pragmatism demonstrates the interactive and relational nature of
philosophizing.</p>

<p>
The history of pragmatism is recent enough that we can more easily
recover and recognize the women who participated in forming this
uniquely American school of thought, formerly considered only through
the work of such male thinkers as William James, Charles Sanders
Peirce, George Herbert Mead, George Santayana, and John Dewey. The
work of women who were in philosophic and activist dialogue with these
philosophers were original philosophers in their own right and were
responsible for many social innovations. Yet, they had mostly
disappeared from the pragmatist dialogue until the latter part of the
twentieth century. Charlene Haddock Seigfried&rsquo;s work,
particularly her 1996 book <em>Pragmatism and Feminism</em>, was
central in the effort to bring these invisible women back into the
philosophical discussion, as well as to bring feminist perspectives to
the field of pragmatism.</p>

<p>
In the Progressive Era, many of the college-educated social reformers
in the Chicago area lived at Hull House or were associated with the
University of Chicago. Some of the Hull-House reformers, such as
Sophonisba Breckinridge and Edith and Grace Abbott, held academic
positions but did most of their academic and activist work in the
realm of social reform. Some, such as Julia Lathrop and Florence
Kelly, went on to hold influential governmental positions. Other
feminist pragmatists working on social and philosophic issues worked
with James and Royce at Harvard or were engaged with feminist reforms
in other fields, such as suffrage activism or peace work.</p>

<p>
Some of the first generation of feminist pragmatists included the
following women (in alphabetical order):</p>

<p>
<strong>Jane Addams</strong> (1860&ndash;1935) was a central figure in
the development of pragmatist thought. In her lifetime Addams was
revered as one of America&rsquo;s most famous social reformers, the
founder of Hull House, and the recipient of the 1931 Nobel Peace
Prize. Her pragmatist philosophies emerged from her experiences
working in the poverty-stricken immigrant neighborhoods of Chicago,
from her collaborations with the talented women who lived at Hull
House, as well from reflection on texts and direct dialogue with
philosophers of her time (including John Dewey, William James, George
Herbert Mead, and W.E.B. DuBois). Addams published eleven books and
hundreds of essays, writing on ethics, social philosophy, and
pacifism, in addition to analyzing social issues concerning women,
industrialization, immigration, urban youth, and international
mediation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Emily Greene Balch</strong> (1867&ndash;1961) was a member of
the first graduating class at Bryn Mawr. She pursued graduate studies
at the University of Chicago and the Harvard Annex and taught at
Wellesley College for over 20 years. Along with Addams, she was a
founding member of the Women&rsquo;s International League for Peace
and Freedom. While trained as a sociologist and an economist, evidence
of pragmatist philosophy is abundant in her work. This is particularly
true in her support of social democracy and in her fundamental faith
that the social environment was capable of transformation through
philosophical reflection and action. Her commitment to pluralism and
economic justice led her to work on suffrage activism and global
racial justice. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946.</p>

<p>
<strong>Ella Lyman Cabot</strong> (1866&ndash;1934) struggled to be a
philosopher in the male-dominated philosophies of early
20<sup>th</sup> century. She took classes at Harvard and Radcliffe
with James and Royce. She continued to be part of the Harvard
philosophical community and as such was also a formative influence on
others&rsquo; writings. She was also a longtime advocate of
women&rsquo;s rights. She wrote seven books on ethics and education.
Her work was recovered in John Kaag&rsquo;s 2013 book <em>Pragmatism,
Feminism, and Idealism in the Philosophy of Ella Lyman Cabot</em>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Mary Whiton Calkins</strong> (1863&ndash;1930) studied under
pragmatists William James and Josiah Royce at Harvard, primarily
working in psychology, which was then a sub-field of philosophy. In
1905, Calkins became the first woman president of the American
Psychological Association and in 1918 became the first woman president
of the American Philosophical Association. She was an advocate for
women&rsquo;s suffrage, claiming in 1905 that &ldquo;a distinction
based on difference of sex is artificial and illogical&rdquo; (Harper
(ed.) 1922: 171). While not generally categorized as a pragmatist
philosopher, her influence as a female philosopher created a pathway
for other women philosophers.</p>

<p>
<strong>Elsie Ripley Clapp</strong> (1882&ndash;1965) was a student of
classical pragmatists, taking over fourteen courses from Dewey at
Columbia, working as his graduate assistant, and collaborating on
research projects with him for years (see Seigfried 2001:
89&ndash;90). Clapp commented on drafts of Dewey&rsquo;s work, and
contributed original ideas (Seigfried 1996: 92). Dewey publicly
acknowledged Clapp for her contributions to <em>Democracy and
Education</em>, but only in the introduction, not attributing to her
any particular ideas in the body of the text. At his retirement in
1927, Dewey suggested that Clapp should be appointed to teach his
courses at the Teachers College, but she was not offered the position
by the college. She went on to collaborate with Eleanor Roosevelt on
significant rural education projects of her time.</p>

<p>
<strong>Anna Julia Cooper</strong> (1858&ndash;1954) was an
educational reformer, particularly focused on the education of
African-American women. She received her BA and MA at Oberlin College
and earned her Ph.D. at the Sorbonne at the age of 66. Her writings
about the dual oppressions of race and gender are considered one of
the foundations of contemporary feminist theories of
intersectionality. She is best known for her 1892 book, <em>A Voice
from the South by a Black Woman of the South</em>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Alice Chipman Dewey</strong> (1858&ndash;1927) is generally
credited with bringing Dewey&rsquo;s philosophic Hegelian thinking
into contact with real social issues. She was raised in Michigan by
her pioneering grandfather and attended a Baptist seminary after high
school. Her lifelong interest in education led her to be a school
teacher. This work, along with her commitment to the women&rsquo;s
rights movement, led her to study at the University of Michigan where
she met John Dewey. Their daughter Jane described Alice&rsquo;s
influence on John by saying that &ldquo;things which previously had
been matters of theory acquired through his contact with her a vital
and direct human significance&rdquo; (Rockefeller 1991: 150). Alice
Dewey continued her interest in education as principal of the
University of Chicago Lab School where she worked with Dewey on
experimental and experiential education reform.</p>

<p>
<strong>Mary Parker Follett</strong> (1868&ndash;1933) studied with
Royce, James, and Hart at Radcliffe/Harvard. Her academic training was
primarily in political theory and philosophy. Like Addams and many of
the feminist pragmatists of her era, her philosophy was developed out
of her deep engagement with social issues in her Boston community, and
from observing how people interact in public life. Follett thought
that the simple act of voting would never change society and thus
never directly advocated for women&rsquo;s suffrage. Like most
pragmatists, Follett critiqued the dualism of individualism, claiming
&ldquo;(t)he group and the individual come into existence
simultaneously&rdquo; (1918: 127). Follett&rsquo;s advocacy of
&ldquo;power-with&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;power-over&rdquo; in
political as well as organizational work is considered a precursor to
contemporary feminist analyses of power (see Pratt 2011; Kaag 2011;
Whipps 2014b). Follett published three books and many essays and
speeches. During her lifetime, she was well-known as a management
consultant and her work has recently gained new significance in
contemporary management theory as well as modern leadership
studies.</p>

<p>
<strong>Charlotte Perkins Gilman</strong> (1860&ndash;1935) was a
lifelong friend of both John Dewey and Jane Addams. Gilman stayed at
Hull House for about a month in 1895 where she lectured and explored
the settlement culture. Gilman, not formally trained in philosophy,
was interested in the philosophy of &ldquo;find(ing) out what ailed
society and how most easily to improve it&rdquo; (Upin 1993: 42).
Gilman was particularly concerned with the industrial and economic
conditions of women, both in the home and in the workplace. She sought
to use philosophy in order to address the social and political
problems of her time and place, particularly related to women&rsquo;s
issues. She is the author of nine novels, including the feminist
utopian novel <em>Herland</em>, and ten works of nonfiction, including
<em>Women and Economics: A Study of the Economic Relation Between Men
and Women as a Factor in Social Evolution</em>. Gilman&rsquo;s short
story &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper&rdquo; is a classic in feminist
literature.</p>

<p>
<strong>Florence Kelley</strong> (1859&ndash;1932) was an early
resident of Hull House and a lifelong friend of Addams. She dedicated
her life to the fight for legal social rights, working to eliminate
child labor and brutally long working hours with degrading low pay.
She was trained in social science, studied Marxism, and was awarded
her law degree from Northwestern University. She claimed that
individual rights were insufficient for a democracy; laws that
protected the social and economic well-being of all citizens were also
essential. As the general secretary of the National Consumers League
and a founding member of the NAACP, she brought feminist pragmatism to
national politics. She published three books and numerous articles,
mostly on industrial and social reform. She mentored many younger
feminist pragmatists like Grace Abbott and Frances Perkins.</p>

<p>
<strong>Julia Lathrop&#8203;</strong>
(1858&ndash;1932)&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203; moved into
Hull House in its second year, and she remained a member of the
community throughout her life. She was admitted to the Illinois Bar
Association, and she worked with the Chicago Women&rsquo;s Club and
thGeration after Jane Addams and was a student of the classical
pragmatists. As a feminist educator she both defined and reflected the
progressive era philosophies of reform and social change through
educational progress. In 1903, Mitchell became the first dean of women
at the University of California at Berkeley, where she encountered the
sexism that was pervasive in the academy in that era. After moving
back to New York, she began a 60-year career in child-centered
education, combining educational scholarship in both research and
practice while founding and administrating innovative programs. In her
lifetime, she was also seen as an example for other women who were
interested in professional lives while marrying and raising children,
something that was rarely available to the women of her generation.
Mitchell&rsquo;s Bank Street School demonstrated the effectiveness of
pragmatist child-centered education and continues to influence
childhood development specialists and educators.</p>

<p>
<strong>Mary Church Terrell </strong>(1863&ndash;1954) was a writer,
activist, suffrage worker, and civil rights leader who spent most of
her life engaged in work to improve the lives of African Americans.
She received her BA and MA at Oberlin College, attending in the same
years as Anna J. Cooper. She was the first African-American woman
appointed to the Washington D.C. school board. Terrell was a leader in
the African American women&rsquo;s club movement, as a founder and
then president of the National Association of Colored Women. Her
writing and activism were consistent with feminist pragmatism without
directly mirroring that of white feminist pragmatists. As she said,
African American women faced two barriers to public life: her sex and
her race. Terrell was a friend of Addams and later a member of the
board of the WILPF. She mentored Mary McLeod Bethune, who was
influential in Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal programs for social reform.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Ella Flagg Young</strong> (1845&ndash;1918) was a lifelong
educator and then administrator in the school system in Chicago, and
later was a professor of education at the University of Chicago. She
was elected the first woman president of the National Education
Association and worked for women&rsquo;s suffrage. According to
Seigfried, Dewey was specific about how Young&rsquo;s &ldquo;original
interpretations and applications of his theories went beyond his own
understanding&rdquo; (Seigfried 1996: 80). According to Joan K. Smith
(1977), Young began taking classes from John Dewey at the University
of Chicago in the fall of 1895; at that point she had over 30 years of
experience in teaching and administration. She published three books
on education.</p>

<p>
The feminist pragmatists of the next generation were often mentored by
the women above. Lucy Sprague Mitchell (1878&ndash;1967) grew up in
Chicago and was a friend of Addams and Dewey before moving to
Radcliffe where she studied with Royce and James. Mitchell became a
pioneer in children&rsquo;s education. Grace Abbott, who lived at Hull
House and worked closely with Addams, was the first director of the
Immigrants&rsquo; Protective League and then became a powerful force
in Washington politics as the head of the Children&rsquo;s Bureau in
the 1920s and 30s. Frances Perkins, the first female Secretary of
Labor, had been a part-time resident of Hull House. Earlier in her
career, as head of the New York Consumer&rsquo;s League, she was
mentored by Kelley. Perkins was responsible for many social and
economic innovations in FDR&rsquo;s New Deal, such as Social Security
and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Mary McLeod Bethune was mentored by
Mary Church Terrell in her work as president of the National
Association of Colored Women in the 1920s. Bethune was the Director of
the federal Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth
Administration and a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. She became the
most powerful African American woman in FDR&rsquo;s administration in
the 1930s. (See Whipps 2024.)</p>

<h2 id="FemiReReadClasPragPhil">2. Feminist Re-reading and Expansion of Classical Pragmatism</h2>

<p>
In the late twentieth century, feminist philosophers began
re-examining philosophic texts through the lens of gender, analyzing
how particular thinkers&rsquo; philosophies often incorporate the
subjugation of women; for example, Rousseau&rsquo;s idealized
&ldquo;Emile&rdquo; is only possible through the supporting role of
the idea of &ldquo;Sophie.&rdquo; Likewise, feminist pragmatists have
examined the role of women and gender in the canon of pragmatist
philosophy, particularly looking at the work of John Dewey, Charles
Sanders Peirce, William James, and George Herbert Mead. Pragmatism
originated in a time when our culture was in the midst of enormous
change in women&rsquo;s roles, yet early male pragmatists were often
unaware of how gender biases affected knowledge and culture as well as
their own ideas. Like many figures in the philosophical canon, at
times they universalize the male perspective. Yet, as we will see,
pragmatism and feminism overlap in significant ways, and even in their
critiques, feminists find value in these thinkers&rsquo; works.</p>

<p>
Books such as <em>Feminist Interpretations of John Dewey</em>
(Seigfried 2001) and <em>Feminist Interpretations of William
James</em> (Tarver and Sullivan 2015) have made these influences
clear. In this latter volume, Erin McKenna&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;Women
and William James&rdquo; points out James&rsquo; expectation that the
women in his life (particularly his wife, mother, and sister) play
traditional roles of self-sacrifice. The concept of &ldquo;free
will&rdquo; is central to James&rsquo; work, yet, as McKenna reveals,
he didn&rsquo;t grasp how his gender, class, and race provided him
this freedom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The opportunity to exercise &ldquo;free will&rdquo; was not shared
equally, and he did not see now his freedom intersected with the
oppression of others. (McKenna 2015: 83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Other pragmatist feminists have also examined the gendered reception
of philosophers&rsquo; writings. For example, Marilyn Fischer reread
James&rsquo;s acclaimed &ldquo;The Moral Equivalent of War&rdquo; in
the context of its time, demonstrating that James drew on
&ldquo;common conceptions shared by militarists, misogynists, and
imperialists of the day&rdquo; (2018).</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s thinking was also shaped by the gendered expectations of
his time and place, even though women played more equal roles in his
life. As Seigfried noted (1998), Dewey was a supporter of many
feminist causes. Yet, as she also pointed out later, &ldquo;the
pitfalls of a view of women seen solely from a male perspective, even
that of a sympathetic male,&rdquo; still affect Dewey&rsquo;s writing
(2001: 10). Why does this matter? As Nancy Tuana has said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Paying attention to the workings of gender within the texts of
philosophy will make visible the complexities of the inscription of
gender ideologies. (Tarver and Sullivan 2015: ix)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These feminist re-readings and analyses have provided a view of the
cultural context of pragmatist writings; it helps us understand how
and why women were marginalized in the intellectual history of
pragmatism. As we will see, these important critiques have not
deterred feminist pragmatists from seeing the value in and building
upon the work of these classical pragmatist thinkers. As Patricia Hill
Collins has noted, &ldquo;much of this work on individual women
philosophers aims to revise the narrative to correct for existing
bias&rdquo; and thus yield &ldquo;new insights about the substance of
pragmatism itself&rdquo; (Collins 2019: 177).</p>

<h2 id="PragFemiPhilThem">3. Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes</h2>

<p>
Contemporary feminist pragmatists also implement and extend pragmatist
philosophies as a foundation for feminist theory. Working in the
pragmatist tradition, they point out that pragmatism offers a
valuable, although often unrecognized, resource for feminist thinkers.
For example, contemporary feminists point out how traditional
philosophy&rsquo;s emphasis on rational, logical absolutes devalues
the ambiguities of the experience of an embodied life. For feminist
pragmatists, pluralistic communities have epistemological value and
provide the base for an inclusive problem-solving approach to social
issues. The pragmatist understanding of education as a social and
political force, as a major aspect of how society and individuals are
shaped, has been echoed by contemporary feminists who analyze our
educational curriculum and methods of teaching. Both pragmatism and
feminism are more likely to bring social context to the forefront of
philosophy, opening space for realities in flux, for emergent
situations to be shaped and reconstructed by their context.
Pragmatists emphasize that we must include particular and individual
experiences in a pluralistic discussion of multiple realities, and
that all parties involved in an issue also be involved in the
problem-solving process. More recent efforts have also pressed for a
relational understanding of existence that includes the non-human.</p>

<h3 id="ValuExpe">3.1 Valuing Experience</h3>

<p>
A historical examination of pragmatism shows a reverse ordering of the
theory-action method sometimes assumed in philosophical thought, and
often critiqued by feminist thinkers. In its privileging of theory,
some philosophical texts leave us with the impression that ideas
normally originate from ideal and often solitary theoretical thinking
that is then diffused into the general culture. However, in the case
of many women activists, like Jane Addams, it is evident that public
and political activism shaped the character of the philosophy. Indeed,
she advised leaders to &ldquo;move with the people&rdquo;, aiming to
first &ldquo;discover what people really want&rdquo; so that they can
together uncover a way forward that neither could alone &ldquo;see
very clearly till they come to it&rdquo; (1902 [2002]: 69). Such a
method is consistent with pragmatism; as 20<sup>th</sup> century
pragmatist Sidney Hook said, &ldquo;social action is the mother of
inspiration and not, as is usually imagined, its offspring&rdquo;
(1940 [1991]: 3). Feminist theory has also grown out of the activism
of the women&rsquo;s movement; it incorporates the understandings that
have resulted from social activism. Pragmatist philosophers often made
these same points in their critiques of positivism. Both pragmatists
and feminists advocate for the practical use of philosophy in the
realm of personal and public experience; pragmatism and feminism
generally also share a social and/or political focus and advocate
specific cultural changes.</p>

<p>
The pragmatist commitment to situated knowledge, rather than abstract
or idealized knowing, has been influential in some fields of feminist
ethics, particularly in care ethics. Maurice Hamington draws on
Addams&rsquo;s ethics to articulate &ldquo;a proactive embodied
care&rdquo; based on &ldquo; habits of interaction&rdquo; (2004: 104).
George Herbert Mead&rsquo;s philosophy of the self has also played a
prominent role in care ethics for both Hamington and Heather Keith. As
Keith said of Mead&rsquo;s concept: &ldquo; the self is wholly
integrated into an ecology of both physical and social relationships
facilitates a conception of selfhood valuable to the sort of personal
and moral liberation called for by feminism&rdquo; (1999: 330).</p>

<p>
Contemporary feminists and pragmatists share an effort to radically
change oppressive political and social structures, an effort that
finds resonance with the early feminist pragmatists. Jane Addams and
other feminist reformers like Kelley, Lathrop, and Terrell were
continuously involved in fighting oppression, especially of women,
children, and minorities. Pragmatism&rsquo;s continued insistence that
philosophy should address the problems of the current social situation
supports critiques of gender, race, and class oppression, even though
the majority of pragmatism&rsquo;s male founders were often relatively
inattentive to cultural gender-related oppression.</p>

<h3 id="Epis">3.2 Epistemology</h3>

<p>
Feminists and pragmatists share an interest in the situatedness of the
knower within their social environment. They are both committed to an
epistemology that is based in experience and relationality. Feminist
pragmatists point out that the search for universalized ideals
bankrupts ordinary experience and robs from philosophic thought the
creativity of thinking with and through complex networks of experience
and interaction. In <em>Pragmatism and Feminism</em>, Seigfried
highlights aspects of pragmatism that make it useful to feminist
epistemology, noting both fields share a critique of dualism.
Seigfried reminds her reader of four dualistic aspects of
rationalistic philosophy critiqued by Dewey and some feminists for its
oppressive support of invidious social/economic hierarchies. The four
dimensions of this rationalist approach include:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>The depreciation of doing and making and the over-evaluation of
pure thinking and reflection;</li>

<li>the contempt for bodies and matter and simultaneous praise of
spirit and immateriality,</li>

<li>the sharp division of practice and theory, and</li>

<li>the inferiority of change and superiority of a fixed reality.
(Seigfried 1996: 113)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Jane Duran, in &ldquo;The Intersection of Pragmatism and
Feminism&rdquo; (1993), points out that feminist theorists critique
this preoccupation with universals, writing that it seems &ldquo;to
pervade much of analytic philosophy (indeed philosophy as a
whole)&rdquo;. This desire for universals, she says, leads all the way
back to Plato. Plato&rsquo;s idealism carries with it a devaluation of
the changing realm of the physical world. Duran points out that
feminists, as well as pragmatists, are often less interested in
universal generalities and notes that an emphasis on particulars as
well as &ldquo;relations and connections become almost more important
than particulars themselves&rdquo; (1993: 166). This pluralistic sense
of refusing to constrict reality to that which is defined by logic or
language helps feminists as philosophers propose an alternative vision
of philosophy.</p>

<p>
Susan Dielman points to the importance of discourse and language
analysis in addressing hegemonic epistemic exclusions; she brings
neopragmatist theory, specifically that of Richard Rorty, into the
feminist pragmatist dialogue in order to understand &ldquo;the
interconnectedness of power and discourse&rdquo; (2012: 99).</p>

<p>
Feminist pragmatists have also built on John Dewey&rsquo;s concept of
experience as philosophical support for a position that holds together
the subject and object in a nondualistic epistemology. Yet, as
postcolonial feminists have pointed out, experience in itself is
conditioned by one&rsquo;s cultural background. Ofelia Schutte (2000)
notes that &ldquo;the nature of knowledge is not culture-free but is
determined by the methodologies and data legitimated by dominant
cultures&rdquo; (2000: 40). Feminist-pragmatist Celia T.
Bardwell-Jones (2008) draws on Josiah Royce&rsquo;s theory of
interpretation to address the problem of translation &ldquo;at the
borders of conflicting experience&hellip;where differences are
translated instead of assimilated&rdquo; (2008: 22). Such
epistemological translation work is essential for feminists and
pragmatists, given that in both fields theory is inherently about
changing the world Jane Addams embodied this intersection of
pragmatism and feminism in her efforts to interpret across class and
cultural boundaries; through this interpretative and activist work she
sought to reconstruct the social order and increase justice for women
and the underprivileged. Addams&rsquo; understanding of the
relationship between action and truth contributed to her choice of a
career in the public world. For her, a motivation to address the
suffering in the world motivated reflection and engagement. As a
public philosopher, reformer, and activist embedded in her community,
Addams was called to act under inherently messy, dynamic, and
ambiguous situations (see Fischer 2005, 2011, 2013 and Lake 2014,
2015). This interpretive activism opened opportunities for
reconstruction, redefining relations between the public and the
expert, students and the instructor, the governed and the
governors.</p>

<p>
Similarly contemporary feminist thinkers have changed the academy and
the larger culture by re-analyzing and reconstructing the ways that we
think, the hierarchies of knowing, as well as the social conventions
that have defined gender. Erin McKenna in <em>The Task of Utopia:
Pragmatist and Feminist Perspective</em> (2001) uses this
process-orientation to create a social/political philosophy that is
always open to change, rather than one with finished
&ldquo;ends&rdquo; in view. With both feminism and pragmatism we can
consider philosophizing contextually as a creative force, reacting to
as well as reconstructing our multiple environments.</p>

<p>
Feminist social analysis often produces the conditions for philosophic
reflection, creating what Addams called &ldquo;perplexities&rdquo;
that are the starting points for philosophical and political change
(1902 [2002]: 77). In &ldquo;Feminist-Pragmatist Revisioning of
Reason, Knowledge, and Philosophy&rdquo; (1993), Phyllis Rooney notes
that the classical pragmatists would have welcomed the challenges that
contemporary feminisms have brought to philosophy. She compares these
rifts to what Peirce called the &ldquo;irritations of doubt&rdquo;
(Peirce 1877, quoted in Rooney 1993: 21) which open the door to
inquiry and signal possibilities for recreation and rediscovery. Dewey
called this irritation &ldquo;an unsettlement&rdquo; that &ldquo;aims
at overcoming a disturbance&rdquo; or the &ldquo;uncertainties of
life&rdquo; (1916 [1985]: 336&ndash;337), which he says, are the
motivations for beginning to do philosophy. In <em>Democracy and
Social Ethics</em>, Addams references moments of
&ldquo;perplexities&rdquo; as openings to begin rethinking social
values and epistemological claims. Pragmatism and feminism then share
a movement toward active philosophizing about those
&ldquo;irritations&rdquo;, &ldquo;uncertainties&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;perplexities&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Feminist epistemologists such as Susan Bordo and Alison Jaggar point
out how traditional philosophy&rsquo;s emphasis on rational, logical
absolutes has devalued the ambiguities of changing embodied
experience. Feminists and pragmatists have both rejected body/mind
dualisms. For instance, Clara Fischer, who also writes on Irish
feminism, turns to John Dewey to address body/mind and emotion/reason
dualisms, demonstrating that feminists could draw on the pragmatist
tradition to address philosophies of embodiment (2018). Shannon
Sullivan in <em>Living Across and Through Skins</em> (2001) brings the
pragmatist tradition of transactional knowing through embodied and
relational lived experience to the feminist epistemology of standpoint
theory, describing what she calls a &ldquo;pragmatist-feminist
standpoint theory&rdquo;. This pragmatist-feminist perspective
suggests knowing unfolds in relationships enacted through our physical
embodiment and the social environment; knowing should thus incorporate
&ldquo;multiple marginalized perspectives&rdquo;. Using Dewey&rsquo;s
standard of truth as that which results in &ldquo;transactional
flourishing,&rdquo; Sullivan considers &ldquo;questions about which
standpoints can help promote flourishing transactions&rdquo; (2001:
146&ndash;47). In doing so, she corrects the privileging of
women&rsquo;s experiences that is found in Sandra Harding&rsquo;s
feminist standpoint theory and locates knowing as transactions among
diverse others, possibly even non-humans. Sullivan&rsquo;s work is
particularly significant in the ways she investigates feminist issues
of embodiment, drawing on both Continental and American Pragmatist
perspectives.</p>

<p>
Wicked problem scholars and systemic design practitioners Danielle
Lake, Josina Vink, Valerie Brown, and Judith Lambert also employ a
feminist pragmatist epistemology in their work. Brown and
Lambert&rsquo;s 2013 <em>Collective Learning for Transformational
Change: A Guide to Collaborative Action</em>. Brown and Lambert, for
instance, argue that sustainable and just transformational change on
our collective social problems requires we begin by first sharing our
values. Since our core values tend to shape our perspective and our
actions, recognizing the range of values involved explicates the
complexities. Their model also emphasizes individual narratives and
legitimizes a range of knowledge, including individual, community,
specialized, organizational, holistic, and collective knowledge
cultures (2013:
 22).<sup>[<a href="render.cgi?login=dlake&amp;id=dlake&amp;role=au&amp;entry=femapproach-pragmatism&amp;page=notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Lake et al.&rsquo;s place-based counter storytelling collaborative
works to shift how knowledge is constructed and shared, attempting to
prompt more participatory and emergent place-making projects (2023).
Similarly, Vink&rsquo;s systemic design efforts in the public service
sector begin with relational connections and tensions and pursue
change through incremental and emergent actions with diverse
stakeholders. These ways of framing and activating epistemology have
had&mdash;and continue to have&mdash;a significant influence on
educational practices. </p>

<h3 id="Educ">3.3 Education</h3>

<p>
The experimental and relational approaches of feminism and pragmatism
have reshaped education theory and practices in pedagogy, research
methods, and curriculum. Historically and today, pragmatist feminists
are innovators of new pedagogical methods, focusing on engaged,
place-based learning. Many pragmatist feminists analyze the ways
knowledge is produced, searching to understand the situatedness of the
researcher and the ways that politics and values affect the production
of knowledge. Others have uncovered the often-gendered biases that
have shaped prescribed curriculums.</p>

<p>
Progressive Era pragmatist feminists had an enormous influence on
childhood and adult education. Many of these early feminist
pragmatists had a direct and sustained influence on Dewey&rsquo;s
educational philosophy, from Jane Addams and Alice Chipman Dewey, to
Ella Flagg Young, Elsie Ripley Clapp, and Lucy Sprague Mitchell.
Indeed, Dewey had not published or worked in the philosophy of
education before he came to Chicago, where he experienced Jane
Addams&rsquo;s Hull House and worked with individuals like Ella Flagg
Young. Young&rsquo;s contributions to Dewey&rsquo;s philosophy
included: (1) &ldquo;the extent to which freedom meant &hellip; a
respect for the inquiring or reflective process of individuals&rdquo;;
(2) an understanding of &ldquo;the way that the interactions of
persons with one another influence their mental habits&rdquo;; and,
(3) &ldquo;how all psychology that was not simply physiological was
social&rdquo; (Seigfried 1996: 80).</p>

<p>
Early pragmatist-feminist writing consistently demonstrates a distrust
of educational theories that are disconnected from experience.
Addams&rsquo; educational philosophy provides a model for the
interaction between thinking and action. For Addams, as well as for
other educators, education is not seen as standing apart from life but
rather blending seamlessly into the fabric of experiences and
providing a meaning-making function. Addams understood that while
education informs experience (providing historical context as well as
skills), it must also interact with and change in response to current
social needs. In understanding the culture that students come from as
well as the values of their lives, Addams argued for an educational
approach that uses students&rsquo; own experiences (personal as well
as cultural) as starting points for learning.</p>

<p>
In <em>Twenty Years at Hull House</em> (1910), Addams talks about how
many professors&rsquo; lack of interest in matters of the
&ldquo;welfare of mankind&rdquo; leaves behind the messy and chaotic
experiential realm of social relationships for the theoretical realm;
she argued this separation also opens students to the influence of
&ldquo;charlatans&rdquo; (1910 [1990]: 247). Addams&rsquo; vision of
education, even in the early days of Hull House, fostered an
interchange between the intellectual culture of a liberal arts
education and the practical aspects of urban industrial life, bringing
life and thought together. While Dewey is often cited as the catalyst
for experiential learning and civic engagement practices,
Addams&rsquo;s work at Hull House pioneered place-based education. She
designed the Hull House Labor Museum to meet the educational needs of
working adults. Her aim was to provide an avenue where they could see
themselves &ldquo;in connection and cooperation with the whole&rdquo;
of their lives in their communities and, more broadly, in all of human
experience. (Addams, 1902 [2002]: 96.) Other feminist pragmatists
brought this emphasis into their academic classes, such as Emily
Greene Balch, who pioneered academic place-based learning in her
sociology and economics classes at Wellesley, bringing her students to
Boston&rsquo;s settlement houses to experience the issues they were
studying.</p>

<p>
Many early feminist pragmatists were educational administrators as
well as teachers. Anna J. Cooper was the seventh principal of M Street
High School in Washington, where she resisted pressure to teach a
&ldquo;colored curriculum.&rdquo; Many of her students went on to
higher education. Mary Church Terrell was the first African American
woman appointed to the Washington D.C. school board. Lucy Sprague
Mitchell was the first dean of women at the University of California
Berkeley before starting the Bureau of Educational Experiments in New
York, later called the Bank Street School. Addams was involved in
educational reform in the Chicago Public Schools and became a member
of the Chicago School Board. However, Addams&rsquo;s philosophy of
education has had a more enduring impact on adult education theory and
practice, primarily as a result of her innovations at Hull House. In
working with adults, she integrated arts, literature, and history into
industrial life; later, she celebrated the arts and culture that were
already present in the lives of her industrial immigrant communities.
In contrast, Lucy Sprague Mitchell&rsquo;s Bank Street School
demonstrated the effectiveness of pragmatist child-centered education
and continues to influence childhood development specialists and
educators.</p>

<p>
In the late twentieth century, feminist philosophers, such as
Elizabeth Minnich and Jane Roland Martin, analyzed curriculum using a
pragmatist feminist lens. Their critiques pointed out the ways that
the then-traditional philosophical &ldquo;canon&rdquo; perpetuated the
traditional power structures by excluding the works of women and
minorities. Minnich points out that the administrative structures of
colleges and universities often place programs like women&rsquo;s
studies or African-American studies on the periphery of the college
hierarchies. Minnich&rsquo;s 1990 book, <em>Transforming
Knowledge</em>, draws on both a feminist critique and pragmatist
practices to advocate for a rethinking of the patriarchal assumptions
at the base of our academic traditions. This work reconstructs what it
means to do philosophy, opening our definitions of philosophy to
voices that may have been previously excluded or marginalized. Minnich
and other feminist thinkers show us how many traditional theorists
were blinded by dominant hegemonic traditions, limiting their ability
to conceive new approaches. Minnich points out that pragmatism can
share with feminism the vitality that arises from an opening of
philosophy to newness, to otherness, and to diversity. Likewise,
Maxine Greene inspired a generation of educators to think of education
as a practice of freedom, providing spaces for new ways of thinking
and being. In <em>The Dialectic of Freedom</em> (1988), Greene relies
on John Dewey and Jane Addams, as well as feminist novels, to describe
the ways that women have told the truths about their private and
public lives. Greene uses these thinkers to argue for opening a space
for diverse others to appear in the public world, to &ldquo;tear aside
the conventional masks&hellip;that hide women&rsquo;s being in the
world&rdquo; (1988: 57).</p>

<p>
Contemporary pragmatist feminists often draw on the reflective
place-based practices of early pragmatist educators in their
conceptualization of education as a political and emancipatory
practice. As Filipino feminist pragmatist philosopher Krissah Marga B.
Taganas said, for both feminism and pragmatism, the &ldquo;main tenet
of dissolving fixed truths or dualism can be used to overthrow
hegemonic structures and norms within society. Recognition of multiple
views and diversity, especially in the experiences of women and other
marginalized communities, aids the transformative process in
society&rdquo; (2022: 51). Place-based learning has emerged as an
important practice for contemporary educators (See Brister, 2023,
Varner, 2021b, Lake 2019, Lake et al. 2023, Whipps, 2014b.) For
example, Danielle Lake et al.&rsquo;s innovative work in the Power
&amp; Place Collaboration brings her students into dialogue with the
local community. This counter-storytelling initiative provides a space
for local community members to create a shared history based on their
own stories. Other educators draw on pragmatist feminism to broaden
educational practices. For example, David Kolb utilizes Dewey&rsquo;s
philosophy to advocate for a move away from narrowly framed and
abstract specialization towards experiential learning (2003). Kolb,
like many others, emphasizes learning as a spiral cycle of reflective
action and engagement (Brown and Lambert 2013; Norton 2005). Taganas
used the feminist pragmatist perspective to analyze online learning
during the pandemic as a method of inclusivity and social
transformation (2022).</p>

<p>
Recent feminist pragmatist pedagogies integrate scholarship on wicked
problems, sustainability education, outdoor education, and community
engagement (Lake 2015; Whipps 2014a; Parker 2010, Varner 2021a). This
educational approach extends the work of Dewey and Addams,
highlighting the need for &ldquo;context-sensitive, dialogue-driven,
action-based&rdquo; learning (Lake 2015: 252). The integration and
application of these fields offer students opportunities to impact
real problems, develop skills, and foster virtues necessary for
collaboratively addressing public problems. Current research
highlights how this type of education prepares students to take on the
role of an integrator and &ldquo;boundary spanner&rdquo; (Ramaley
2014: 12) in addition to fostering &ldquo;change agent&rdquo; skills
(Svanstr&ouml;m, Lozano-Garc&iacute;a, and Rowe 2008).</p>

<h3 id="SociActi">3.4 Social Action</h3>

<p>
Early feminist pragmatists often influenced the intellectual culture
of the Progressive Era and early pragmatist thought through activism.
While early feminist pragmatists were influenced by Darwinian thought,
they rejected the harsh position of Social Darwinism that pits humans
in a competitive fight for individual survival. Instead, they used the
concepts of evolution to theorize the possibilities of social
progress, affirming a social ethic that mandates humans have both the
ability and the responsibility to improve their environment. Charlotte
Perkins Gilman, for example, concentrated much of her writing on
social issues of women&rsquo;s environment, working towards radical
changes in the home environment to make it more democratic and
egalitarian. Gilman&rsquo;s writing recommended some Hull House
innovations as examples of some of the social changes she recommended,
such as having professional cooks making healthy family meals in a
public kitchen, instituting daycare centers, and abolishing industrial
child labor. Addams was also quite perceptive about the perplexities
of home life for women; in <em>Democracy and Social Ethics</em>, she
consistently advocated that the private home life of women should more
directly align with a public social good.</p>

<p>
Addams&rsquo;s life work&mdash;involving both place-based local
activism and global outreach&mdash;is a powerful illustration of
enacting experimental values under specific conditions through an
iterative process of concrete experience and reflective theorizing.
Rather than a philosophic retreat from the events and textures of
everyday life, feminist pragmatists have chosen to do philosophy in an
interactive and public mode. Marilyn Fischer describes Addams&rsquo;s
activism and writing as &ldquo;an experiment in real time of the
process of democratic, pragmatist political reconstruction&rdquo;. She
continues by labeling her activism as &ldquo;the sort of concrete
experience from which pragmatist theory emerges and to which it must
return for validation&rdquo; (2013: 229). In <em>Jane Addams&rsquo;s
Evolutionary Theorizing: Constructing Democracy and Social Ethics</em>
(2019), Fischer shows that Addams, in analyzing the most pressing
social issues of her day, drew on a vast array of international
intellectual resources, most notably from theorists across the
disciplines who patterned their work on evolutionary biology. By
showing that Addams was a more wide-ranging intellectual than has been
documented to date, Fischer&rsquo;s work also expands our
understanding of the roots of classical American pragmatism.</p>

<p>
Peace activism is a field of social activism that engaged many of the
women of the early progressive pragmatist era. Starting with the
Spanish-American War of 1899 and in the decades prior to World War I,
pragmatists and feminists worked on anti-imperialist campaigns and
fought militarist influences in society. After the beginning of the
war in Europe, political activism in opposition to war and working for
alternatives to war became, for some women, their primary occupation.
Yet, for most of these activists, &ldquo;peace&rdquo; was much more
that the absence of war; instead it signaled a new cooperative
approach to social life. As noted earlier, Jane Addams and Emily
Greene Balch both received the Nobel Peace Prize (Addams in 1931,
Balch in 1946). Addams and Balch were also founding members of the
Women&rsquo;s International League for Peace and Freedom, an
organization that continues to be internationally influential in
gender justice work.</p>

<p>
In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, peace activism and women&rsquo;s
suffrage movements were often linked. For these women, the movement
toward social justice, toward egalitarian economic structures, and
away from competitive hierarchies necessitated a social structure
based in cooperation and peace, not war. Such belief in the
possibility of substantially changing social and political realities
is at the heart of both pragmatism and feminism. Contemporary scholars
of peace, such as political scientist Patricia M. Shields, draw on
Addams&rsquo;s philosophy of &ldquo; positive peace&rdquo; which
includes advocacy for social justice at all levels of society and
governance (2017: 37). Barcelona philosopher N&uacute;ria Sara Miras
Boronat has published on Addams and pragmatist peace philosophies
(2019), and also works on philosophies of play, drawing on
Mead&rsquo;s work which was influenced by his interaction with Hull
House (2013).</p>

<p>
Twenty-first-century feminist pragmatists also have expanded the
philosophies of early pragmatist feminists by bringing new activist
voices into the philosophic dialogue, such as Gloria Anzuldua, Grace
Lee Boggs, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, and Angela Davis (see Lake 2019,
2020; McKenna and Pratt 2015; James 2009, 2013; Varner 2020.) A number
of contemporary feminist pragmatists (Heldke, Lake, McKenna, Parker)
are advocating for ecological justice, food justice, and animal
justice. Others are looking to scholars of Design and Systems Thinking
experts like Margaret Wheatley, Josina Vink, and Arturo Escobar for
new ways to address social problems.</p>

<p>
Asian American Civil Rights activist Grace Lee Boggs (1915&ndash;2015)
has received particular attention in recent years from pragmatist
feminists who have found Boggs&rsquo;s emphases on lived experience,
pluralism, complexity, and praxis to align with pragmatist feminist
traditions (Lake 2020). Boggs&rsquo; place-based philosophical
activism in Detroit was preceded by formal philosophical training in
pragmatism. She received her 1940 Ph.D. in philosophy (see Grace Chin
Lee) from Bryn Mawr, where she wrote her dissertation on pragmatist
George Herbert Mead.</p>

<h3 id="DiveDemo">3.5 Democratic Pluralism</h3>

<p>
Democracy was a core concept for many early feminist pragmatists,
especially Jane Addams and Mary Parker Follett. For example, democracy
as an ethic provided the theoretical framing for Addams&rsquo;
beginning work at Hull House as well as her later work with labor
unions and feminist activism. In <em>Democracy and Social Ethics</em>
(1902), Addams theorized a continually evolving democracy based on
social association, particular to each generation and locality. As an
ethical system, it placed on each person &ldquo;a moral
obligation&rdquo; to choose experiences of &ldquo;mixing on the
thronged and common road&rdquo; where we can &ldquo;least see the size
of one another&rsquo;s burdens&rdquo; (1902 [2002]: 8&ndash;7). She
critiqued earlier formations of liberty and democracy that
weren&rsquo;t developed out of experience and interaction and that
didn&rsquo;t embrace all classes of society. Addams took this sense of
empathic understanding to larger and larger communities as she moved
from local to national to international work. Democracy, for Addams,
is built upon dialogue, joint experiences, and social equality. She
understood we must give up on the hope that we will &ldquo;settle our
perplexities by mere good fighting&rdquo;, suggesting this stance
emerged from a &ldquo;childish conception of life&rdquo; (1910 [1990]:
57). Her nephew, James Weber Linn, wrote that Addams&rsquo; distrusted
legislation when it was not &ldquo;preceded by full discussion and
understanding&rdquo; (155). Addams&rsquo; commitment to dialogic and
relational democracy emerged from the recognition that &ldquo;genuine
social reform&rdquo; across ideological differences tends to happen
through &ldquo;slow, plodding dullness&rdquo; (Fischer 2016: 5).</p>

<p>
As a political philosopher, Mary Parker Follett wanted to move the
practice of democracy away from the mere action of voting to small
community-based decision-making. She believed that problem-solving via
dialogue and action in local but diverse networks and organizations
was the best basis for democracy. Rejecting compromise as a way of
dealing with difference, she instead advocated for
&ldquo;integration&rdquo;, believing conceptual resolution of
differences must be worked out in everyday action together. According
to Follett, the process of resolution requires full honesty,
self-knowledge, careful listening and understanding of what is
symbolized in the others&rsquo; demands.</p>

<p>
A pluralistic community is an important theoretical and practical
component of pragmatist conceptions of democracy. The &ldquo;social
ethics&rdquo; advocated by Dewey and Addams embraces equality and
multiplicity, narrative and perplexity, fellowship and cooperative
action, sympathetic understanding and the expansion of our ethical
framework. Scott Pratt has noted that these pluralistic values in
American philosophy may have deeper roots than those of James, Dewey,
and Addams. For example, in <em>Native Pragmatism</em> Pratt traces
the gender and cultural pluralistic values of American philosophy to
the early 19<sup>th</sup> century writings of Lydia Marie Child on
indigenous North Americans.</p>

<p>
In fact, Addams, Dewey, and Follett all critiqued the ideal of liberal
individualism, which positions individuals as autonomous beings in
competition with each other for their freedoms. Instead pragmatist
feminists focus on living in a reciprocal and interdependent social
environment, believing this holds the promise of civilization,
cooperation, and coexistence; they work to build communities that
foster these joint associations. By prioritizing community,
pragmatist-feminists encourage us to rethink what it means to live in
a democracy (Green 1999), to provide a feminist communitarian
philosophy (Whipps 2004), or to re-conceive alternative ways of
structuring societies (Boggs and Kurashigo 2012). Early pragmatist
writers join with contemporary feminists in a critique of the
hierarchical systems of power that limit diverse perspectives. Several
contemporary pragmatist-feminists have built upon these foundations to
develop pragmatist-feminist political philosophies, including Judith
Greene in <em>Deep Democracy: Community, Diversity,
Transformation</em> (1990), Beth Singer in <em>Pragmatism, Rights and
Democracy</em> (1999), and Erin McKenna in <em>The Task of Utopia</em>
(2001). These feminist pragmatists imagine a participatory democracy
in which all members of the society are involved in creating the
community. Yet many contemporary feminists criticize recent
communitarian philosophies as potentially harmful to feminist issues;
they argue the call for a &ldquo;return&rdquo; to community values
means a return to values that restrict gender roles or limit
diversity. With this critique in mind, Addams can be seen as a basis
for a feminist progressive communitarianism that critiques isolated
individualism <em>and</em> understands personal identity as
necessarily embedded in the social and political community. While
pragmatists and feminists share the concern for relational community
and pluralistic thinking, they differ in how they construct the Other.
Pragmatists, Seigfried says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
are more likely to emphasize that everyone is a significantly and
valuably Other &hellip; and tend to celebrate otherness by seeking out
and welcoming difference as an expression of creative subjectivity.
(Seigfried 1996: 267)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Francis Hackett, an early resident of Hull House, said about
Addams, &ldquo;One feels in her presence that to be an
&lsquo;other&rsquo; is itself a title to her recognition&rdquo; (1969:
76). Feminists, on the other hand, having experienced the position of
marginalized otherness as women, are more inclined to &ldquo;expose
the controlling force exercised by those who have the power to
construct the Other as a subject of domination&rdquo; (Seigfried 1996:
267).</p>

<p>
In either embracing the diversity of the other, or critiquing a system
that makes persons into object-others, both feminism and pragmatism
provide theoretical tools to analyze and actively fight against the
unjust hierarchies created by racism, classism, and sexism. Shannon
Sullivan, in <em>Revealing Whiteness</em> (2006), notes that Addams
was &ldquo;ahead of her time&rdquo; in her theoretical and practical
focus on reciprocal class and race relations (2006: 168). Sullivan
draws on Dewey&rsquo;s and James&rsquo; writing on habit, as well as
psychoanalytic theory, to call for responsibility for one&rsquo;s
unconscious attitudes. Ant-racism pluralism was a key element in many
of the early feminist-pragmatism works. Addams, Kelley, and Terrell
were founding members of the NAACP; Addams was the chair of the
Chicago branch, and Kelley was a board member of the national NAACP.
(See Whipps, 2023b) Addams, Balch, and Terrell worked led the
international WILPF on anti-racism efforts. </p>

<p>
Contemporary thinkers have drawn on the feminist and pragmatist
traditions in developing &ldquo;visionary Black feminist
pragmatism&rdquo; (V. Denise James) and &ldquo;radical Black feminist
pragmatism&rdquo; (Deva Woodley, Linda C. McClain). James utilizes the
work of Anna J. Cooper to develop visionary Black feminist pragmatism
which she says encompasses &ldquo;academic, cultural, and activist
projects that attempt to take a practical view of social amelioration,
while positing a vision of a radically changed, more just
society&rdquo; (James 2013). Woodly&rsquo;s 2021 analysis of social
movements, using the Black Lives Matter movement as a case study,
draws on principles of Deweyan democracy, including social
intelligence, pragmatic imagination, and democratic experimentation
(Woodly, 51). McClain, a legal scholar, melds both of these concepts
in her re-examination of the possibilities of pragmatism to interpret
the Constitution. Although McClain does not reference back to the
legislative and legal work of earlier feminist pragmatists,
interrogating and re-interpreting the Constitution was central to the
work of Florence Kelley, Grace Abbott, and Frances Perkins. (See
Batlan, 2004 and Whipps, 2024).</p>

<h2 id="Global">4. Global Pragmatist Feminisms</h2>

<p>
One of the most compelling aspects of feminist pragmatism is the need
to engage along and across borders. In <em>The Limits of
Knowledge</em> (2015), Nancy McHugh argues for an approach that
generates and sustains a situated vantage point from which to see
complex, interconnected problems facing local and global communities
across social, economic, cultural, educational, and political divides.
This means we begin in &ldquo;the complexities of the everyday
world&rdquo; and engage with those who are impacted by the results.
Such an approach seeks out &ldquo; marginalized views and marginalized
knowledge,&rdquo; recognizing that long-standing histories shape the
present situation and that our location is embodied (10). Phillip
Dorstewitz highlights how feminist pragmatists seek to engage
&ldquo;at the system&rsquo;s edges&rdquo; (370) in order to engage in
philosophic-activist work. Such work is critical for fostering
&ldquo;the capacity to recognize the actual circumstances of the
world, while simultaneously seeing what lies beneath them&rdquo;
(Griffin, 2009:9). Such work is critical for fostering &ldquo;the
capacity to recognize the actual circumstances of the world, while
simultaneously seeing what lies beneath them&rdquo; (Griffin,
2009:9).</p>

<p>
This interest in cross-boundary work is reflected in the recent surge
of interest in feminist pragmatism globally. In 2020, N&uacute;ria
Sara Miras Boronat, Universitat de Barcelona, organized the first
Women in Pragmatism International Conference, held at the University
of Barcelona, which gathered women and non-binary scholars from twelve
different countries. (See Boronat and Bella, 2022) The resulting
network of feminist pragmatists has supported an increasing number of
scholars. The Women in Pragmatism Network currently sponsors a one-day
conference prior to the European Pragmatist Conference.</p>

<p>
There has also recently been a shift towards uncovering and exploring
the philosophic-activist work unfolding beyond the borders of the
global north. One example is the work of Alessandri and Stehn, who
have illustrated the Mexican influences on feminist border theory
Gloria Anzaldua&rsquo;s writing (2020). In 2020, the Society for the
Advancement of American Philosophy held its annual conference in San
Miguel de Allende, Mexico, highlighting the scholarship of Latin
American philosophies. Rosalva Aida Hernandez Castillo delivered the
Coss Dialogue &ldquo;Against Discursive Colonialism: Intercultural
Dialogues as a Path to Decolonize Feminist Anthropology.&rdquo;
Dorothy Rogers&rsquo;s presentation highlighted the work of indigenous
and early Mexican feminists who rejected the assimilationist agenda in
education (2020, Other Internet Resources). &Aacute;ngeles
Era&ntilde;a, IIF, UNAM, Mexico, described the Mexican Chapter of the
Network of Women Philosophers of Latin America. Siobhan Guerrero Mc
Manus, CEIICH, UNAM, Mexico, spoke on &ldquo;Feminist Philosophies in
Mexico.&rdquo; </p>

<h2 id="Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As pragmatist feminist philosophy continues to develop, more voices
that had been obscured, neglected, and erased within the pragmatist
tradition are being uncovered, reframing the pragmatist tradition.
Contemporary pragmatist feminist philosophers are utilizing those
perspectives to address contemporary philosophical and activist
concerns. Feminist philosophers bring these recovered perspectives to
contemporary feminist projects, such as domestic violence (Banerjee
2008), queer theory, sex trafficking, and community organizing (see
Fischer, Jackson, Brown, and Hamington in Hamington 2010) and human
rights (Lowe 2019). The combined force of pragmatism and contemporary
feminism is leading to a deeper understanding of contemporary
progressive feminist goals, bringing action and theory together in
egalitarian practice.</p>
