<p>
Feminist philosophy of law identifies the pervasive influence of sex
and gender, gendered norms, sexism, misogyny, and patriarchal
structures on theories of law, legal institutions, legal actors, and
people affected by law. It addresses how problematic assumptions about
sex and gender underlie answers to conceptual questions about the
nature of law and legal systems, such as whether law should be
understood as the command of the sovereign, as an interconnected
system of rules, as convention, or as inextricably linked to morality.
It applies feminist lenses to basic values realized through law, such
as freedom or equality. Feminists engage with normative theorizing
about what law and legal systems should do, such as whether law should
be limited to protecting people from harm from others, or extend to
enforcing morality or guarding people from self-harm. Feminists take
many different positions about whether the
 <a href="../law-limits/">Millian &ldquo;harm principle&rdquo;</a>
 should apply to limit interventions by law to situations in which
people put others at risk of harm. Feminist legal philosophers also
demonstrate the myriad effects of patriarchy on the material
conditions of cisgender women and men, people who are nonbinary, and
transgender people. Practically, feminists identify and develop legal
reforms to correct gender injustice, exploitation, abuse, or
repression.</p>

<p>
Feminist legal philosophy is inherently interdisciplinary and appears
in philosophy journals and monographs, journals in gender studies and
feminism, generalist law reviews, and the many specialist law journals
devoted to issues of gender and justice. The journal <em>Feminist
Legal Studies</em> began publishing in 1993 and is notably
international in its reach. The field is also contextual and
practical, responding to existing legal structures and legal
developments such as the US Supreme Court&rsquo;s reversal of
protection for reproductive choice as a federal constitutional right
in 2022 (<em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization</em>).
The discussion in this article is primarily drawn from Anglo-American
legal theory; however,
 <a href="../femapproach-continental/">continental feminist</a>
 theorists have made important contributions to the field as well.</p>

<p>

 <a href="../feminism-political/">Feminism</a>
 itself does not speak with a single voice. Liberal and neoliberal,
pragmatist, relational, cultural, difference, dominance, radical,
socialist, Marxist, postcolonial, transnational, postmodern,
intersectional, along with other newly developing approaches to
feminism provide contrasting contributions to feminist legal
philosophy and take different approaches to concrete legal issues such
as domestic violence or pornography.</p>

<p>
Methodologically, feminist philosophy of law draws from feminist work
in other areas of philosophy. Accounts of epistemic injustice (Fricker
2007) and the
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/">social nature of knowledge</a>
 including standpoint theory (Wylie 2003) are especially salient to
many questions about and within law. Trials, after all, depend on
testimony. Work in relational metaphysics has revealed how legal
institutions can and should instantiate connections among people,
including care relationships, while rejecting essentialist assumptions
about women as caregivers (Herring 2019; Nedelsky 2012; McClain 2006.
As practical and contextual, feminist legal theory engages with
debates about non-ideal theory (Valentini 2012; Stemplowska 2016).</p>

<p>
Feminism&rsquo;s approaches to law reform have been characterized as
coming in historical waves (Dixon 2008; Chamallas 2010; Gruber 2013)
although these characterizations are rough at best (Mayeri 2023). They
also omit references to important earlier feminist thinkers relevant
to law and human rights, such as
 <a href="../wollstonecraft/">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>,
 author of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>;
 <a href="../cockburn/">Catherine Cockburn</a>,
 a theorist of natural law; and
 <a href="../astell/">Mary Astell</a>,
 a defender of equal moral worth. Nineteenth and early twentieth
century feminism pursued basic political and legal rights, such as
rights to vote, own property, and enter into contracts. Liberal
feminism of the 1960s and 1970s sought to dismantle legal barriers and
implement non-discrimination in social and economic life. In the
1980s, difference feminists pursued further reforms aimed to enable
people to remain in the work force despite childbearing, parenting, or
caring for elderly parents. During the same period, dominance
feminists urged legal action against pornography, sexual harassment,
and rape. Later wave voices in the 1990s and after brought
intersectional, transnational, queer, and postmodern theories into the
analysis of reform, arguing that apparently progressive policies such
as mandatory prosecution of alleged domestic violence offenses have
failed to benefit women in poverty, women of color, and immigrant
women while increasing political support for the carceral state (Dixon
2008; Dempsey 2009; Goodmark 2018; Gruber 2020, 2023a, 2023b).
Intersectionality theorizes how locations in multiple socially
constructed categories such as gender, race, class, or disability
create interlocking axes of privilege or disadvantage (Jones 2014;
Crenshaw 2012; Haslanger 2012).</p>

<p>
Despite these differences, some themes are common in feminist
philosophy of law. Normative assumptions include the equal moral worth
of all human beings (and perhaps of some non-human animals as well)
and the entitlement to treatment on an equal basis under law. Equal
treatment is understood as requiring more than the formalism of
&ldquo;treat like cases alike&rdquo;. Feminist philosophers of law
also share certain basic criticisms of traditional views of the nature
of law and legal reasoning, of patriarchy as reflected in structural
injustice and in law, and of the problems people have in securing
equal justice under law (MacKinnon 1993). They are attuned to the ways
in which social power and misogyny have shaped and are shaped by legal
systems and how these interactions affect possibilities for reform
(Manne 2018; Suk 2023).</p>

<p>
This entry begins with a brief overview of fundamental themes of
feminist legal theory, followed by discussion of the evolution of
views about needed institutional changes in selected substantive areas
of law: political equality, marriage, reproduction, pornography and
prostitution, domestic violence and rape, and economic and social
equality.</p>

<h2 id="FunTheFemLegPhi">1. Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy</h2>

<h3 id="ConLaw">1.1 Conceptualizing law</h3>

<p>
Historically, philosophers of law have debated answers to interrelated
questions about the nature of law and legal systems, the meaning of
the rule of law, and relationships between law and morality. On one
side,
 <a href="../natural-law-theories/">natural law theorists</a>
 hold that law and morality bear conceptual connections to one
another: that meeting some kind of moral standard is either necessary
or sufficient for a rule or principle being law. For these theorists,
laws are normatively imbued, thus presenting reasons for action,
perhaps even moral reasons for action. On the other side,
 <a href="../legal-positivism/">legal positivists</a>
 posit law as social fact such as command or accepted rule. For
positivists such as H.L.A. Hart, legal and moral normativity differ;
whether a norm is a law and whether it is just or unjust are separate
questions. Contemporary forms of the debates between natural law and
legal positivism emerged in the aftermath of World War II when
defendants at Nuremberg on trial for crimes against humanity invoked
the defense that they were following the German law in force at the
time. These debates have continued over whether there are legal
obligations in unjust societies such as apartheid South Africa,
whether war crimes or crimes against humanity can be enforced by
international tribunals, and whether the law should reach into domains
of personal life such as family formation or reproduction.</p>

<p>
For the most part, feminist legal theorists have not engaged directly
in the debates between natural law theory and legal positivism about
the nature and scope of law. However, developments in
 <a href="../feminism-metaphysics/">feminist metaphysics</a>
 such as Haslanger&rsquo;s view (2012) that metaphysical questions
should be addressed as projects in ameliorative justice suggest
considering how conceptions of law undergird patriarchy and could be
corrected. For example, the positivist separation of law from morality
might enable clearer identification of when masculinist norms are
implicit in interpretations of liberty protected under the due process
clause of the US Constitution (Siegel 2023; Francis 2017).</p>

<h3 id="RulLaw">1.2 The Rule of Law</h3>

<p>
The
 <a href="../rule-of-law/">rule of law</a>
 is an ideal of political morality under which communities should be
governed by norms that are general, clear, public, prospective,
stable, and implemented consistently. The rule of law has been
identified with the
 <a href="../neoliberalism/">neoliberalism</a>
 of
 <a href="../friedrich-hayek/">Friedrich Hayek</a>,
 the &ldquo;internal morality of law&rdquo; of the natural law
theorist Lon Fuller, or the
 <a href="../legal-reas-interpret/">interpretivist</a>
 view of Ronald Dworkin. The coherence of any particular legal system
can always be challenged, but on this approach an aspiration of any
legal system is coherence. And (at a minimum) the appearance or
illusion of coherence is maintained by requirements such as following
precedent, treating like cases alike, and maintaining judicial
impartiality.</p>

<p>
Although the rule of law contrasts favorably with the exercise of
unconstrained power by people who are not themselves subject to law
(see Dyzenhaus 2016), feminists have been critical of the conservatism
inherent in much rule of law theory. Feminist critics point out that
conceptualizing the rule of law in terms of coherence and consistency
may reinforce and legitimate existing power relationships (Scales
2006; MacKinnon 1989). Indeed, one primary purpose of law as
traditionally understood is to promote stability and order by
reinforcing adherence to predominant norms, representing them not only
as the official values of a society, but even as universal, natural,
and objective. From these observations, feminist philosophers of law
have concluded that law makes systemic bias invisible, normal,
entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose, not only by
legal actors such as judges but also by law&rsquo;s victims and
beneficiaries (Minow 1990; Rhode 1989; MacKinnon 1989).</p>

<h3 id="JudDecMakOri">1.3. Judicial Decision Making and Originalism</h3>

<p>
As the legal actors charged with interpreting and applying law, judges
play a central role in how the rule of law functions. What it means
for judges to apply law is deeply contested, reaching back to
fundamental metaphysical assumptions about what law is. Legal
positivists such as H.L.A. Hart argue both that the law should not
enforce morality and that there are hard cases that existing law is
insufficient to resolve; when
 <a href="../law-limits/">law is thus limited</a>,
 judges function as legislators making new law. Natural law theorists
contend to the contrary that moral principles are part of the law to
be called on by judges. Critics point to the unacknowledged
incorporation of conservative values into legal interpretation (Hanson
1992).</p>

<p>
Originalism is the view that constitutions or laws should be
interpreted in terms of their meaning at the time they were enacted.
Originalism&rsquo;s proponents contend that it constrains judges from
reading their own values into law (e.g., Baude 2015). Feminist critics
argue that originalism continues to entrench patriarchal values (Case
2014). Originalism as found in <em>Dobbs</em>, writes feminist legal
theorist Reva Siegel (2023: 1128), &ldquo;locate[s] constitutional
authority in imagined communities of the past&mdash;entrenching norms,
traditions, and modes of life associated with old status
hierarchies&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="EquDif">1.4 Equality and Difference</h3>

<p>
Feminists take different approaches to articulating and implementing
requirements of equality. For liberal feminists, a primary task is
achieving the principle of procedural equality that like cases should
be treated alike and different cases differently in proportion to
their differences. But procedural equality lacks specification of what
makes cases relevantly similar. Here, the difference between
biological sex and gender identity has loomed increasingly significant
in legal disputes. One area of controversy concerns transition and the
role of bodily interventions such as puberty blockers, hormonal
treatment, or genital surgeries. In most countries of the European
Union, surgery is not required for gender transition to be judged to
be complete; a ruling of the Czech constitutional court in May 2024
reached the same conclusion (Reuters 2024) Controversy also attends
whether categorizations such as in sports should be based on
attributes of biology, themselves disputed, or on gender identity, as
well as how the law should respond. In 2021, the International Olympic
Committee issued a framework of fairness and inclusion for gender
identity and sex variations that left ultimate eligibility judgments
based on evidence of disproportionate advantage up to the
international bodies governing the various sports (IOC 2021). Caster
Semenya, a female athlete diagnosed with the disorder of sex
development 5&alpha;-Reductase 2 deficiency, challenged a World
Athletics requirement that she reduce her testosterone levels in order
to continue competing as a female. In 2023, the European Court of
Human Rights ruled the requirement had not been sufficiently reviewed
by the relevant Swiss court, <em>Semenya v. Switzerland</em>. In
November, 2023, the case was referred for review by the ECHR&rsquo;s
Grand Chamber; no decision had been issued as of the start of
2025.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Difference&rdquo; feminists (e.g., Minow 1990) argue that
equality requires taking physical, historical, social, and other
significant differences into account in developing policy. One
challenge for these feminists is whether and how to acknowledge
differences without entrenching stereotypes, reinforcing detrimental
customs, or promoting sexist socialization. Another challenge is that
recognition of difference may warrant change that in turn incurs
backlash. &ldquo;Dilemmas of difference&rdquo; (Minow 1990) occur when
taking a difference into account seems to be required for
equality&mdash;otherwise, women will face disadvantages that men do
not&mdash;but also seems to critics to instantiate inequality by
giving women benefits such as time off for pregnancy and birth that
men do not have (or at least do not have under policies that grant
parental leave based on status as giving birth). Minow would dissolve
the dilemma with the recognition that the appearance of inequality
rests on unstated norms about the status quo that disadvantage women,
such as the lack of paid family leave. Of note, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Family
Database (OECD 2024), the United States is the only member nation
offering no paid family leave. Sophia Moreau (2020) argues that the
unequal effects of such norms may constitute indirect discrimination
against women.</p>

<p>
Historically, feminists contend, differences based on sex were greatly
exaggerated, as was their significance and the extent to which they
could be attributed to biology rather than being socially constructed.
Yet in the view of many feminists, the impact of pregnancy continues
to be wrongly set aside, especially in the United States. In a single
sentence in <em>Dobbs</em>, for example, Justice Alito dismissed the
idea that protecting choices about pregnancy could be required as a
matter of equality based on sex, reasoning that the lack of access to
abortion would not have a differential impact on women because it
would only affect people based on whether they could get pregnant. One
US feminist commentator has called this reasoning, along with other
decisions of the Court about gun rights and religious liberty, as a
&ldquo;jurisprudence of masculinity&rdquo; that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
evinces a striking solicitude for constitutional rights that are
associated with men and masculinity while exhibiting disdain for and
disinterest in rights that traditionally have been associated with
women. (Murray 2023: 800)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Relatedly, many feminists contend today that debates about legal
recognition of gender identity mistakenly essentialize sex. These
feminists are critical of how law constructs and maintains gender
binaries by using &ldquo;sex assigned at birth&rdquo; as &ldquo;legal
sex&rdquo; in areas from segregated housing in prisons to prohibitions
of gender affirming therapy (Bell 2016). Feminists have argued that
cis-women-protective laws such as those excluding transwomen from
women&rsquo;s sports or bathrooms reenact gender-protective
hierarchies of the nineteenth century (McNamarah 2023). A 2020
decision of the US Supreme Court holding that discrimination because
of sex in employment includes discrimination based on sexual
orientation or gender identity, <em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em>,
has drawn both high praise from feminists for its substance and
criticism from conservatives for its alleged departure from
originalism. In the European Union,
 <a href="#Article21">Article 21</a>
 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits discrimination based
on sexual orientation and
 <a href="#EU2000">Directive 2000/78/EC</a>
 directs implementation of this prohibition in the laws of member
nations.</p>

<h3 id="ReaLaw">1.5 Reasonableness in Law</h3>

<p>
Legal standards of reasonableness are another area where feminist
philosophers excavate male norms at work. From criminal law (would a
reasonable person believe that the threat of harm was sufficient to
require the use of force in self-defense?) to tort law (did the
defendant exercise reasonable care?) to contract law (what are
reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing?) to employment
discrimination (was she reasonably offended by the conduct of others
at work?), reasonableness standards are ubiquitous in law.
Traditionally, the overtly gendered standard was that of the average
reasonable man.</p>

<p>
Today, although the standard is a &ldquo;reasonable person&rdquo;, it
continues to reflect male norms. Social justice tort theorists, for
example, show how damage remedies reinforce material disparities in
society that disproportionately affect women such as depressed wages
or reduced life expectancies (Chamallas 2021). Other feminist tort
theorists widen the lens of harm to include technological and
environmental harms (Richardson &amp; Rackley 2012). Contract law
scholars demonstrate how models of freedom to bargain infect judgments
about deals that are legally enforceable and remedies for breach
(Threedy 2010). Feminist critics of supposed divisions between reason
and emotion have questioned too-ready willingness to reject emotions
in supposedly non-gendered contexts such as rules of evidence and a
too-ready acceptance of emotion in contexts where women are
stereotyped and disadvantaged.</p>

<h3 id="PubPri">1.6 Public and Private</h3>

<p>
Whether distinctions can or should be drawn between the private and
the public is another set of themes in feminist philosophy of law.
Liberals, including liberal feminists, believe that a domain of
private life should be delineated and reserved for individual choice.
The line between the public and the private is related to, but not the
same as, the line drawn by liberal defenders of the harm principle
between actions that affect only individuals themselves and actions
that harm others. Liberal theorists may object to intrusions by law
into both private life and self-regarding actions; but distinguishing
between the private and the self-regarding leaves open the possibility
that harm from one person to another may occur within the private
sphere.</p>

<p>
This &ldquo;private sphere&rdquo; can be understood spatially, most
likely as the home. Protecting private space from intrusion is judged
to be crucial to the development of the person and to the creation and
flourishing of intimate relationships. Radical and dominance feminists
point out in contrast that the home itself may not be a refuge.
Domestic violence can reign invisible and unchecked in the privacy of
the home. However, intersectional feminists observe that both liberal
and dominance feminists risk making unwarranted generalizations about
the impact of intrusions. Far from being protective, police searches
or welfare checks are especially threatening for poor women or women
of color, who may face investigations for child abuse or police
invasions such as resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor or Charleena
Lyles (Chang, Cooper, &amp; Rolnick 2021).</p>

<p>

 <a href="../privacy/">Privacy</a>
 also can be understood as a range of personal choices that should be
left to the individual without state intrusion. These choices
crucially include family structure, reproduction, or sexuality.
Abortion and marriage equality have been flashpoints for discussion of
the meaning and importance of privacy.</p>

<h2 id="FemLegCriLegRef">2. Feminist legal criticism and legal reform</h2>

<p>
Much feminist legal scholarship is devoted to criticism of existing
legal institutions and development of needed reforms. This section
highlights some areas of greatest controversy, especially about
political and economic circumstances and about liberalism and
sexuality. The issues range from assuring political equality, to
considering the extent to which neoliberal models should govern
choices that entrench patriarchal values, to re-evaluating the role of
state coercion in addressing harassment and violence, to reconsidering
models of economic equality. These areas continue to be subjects of
controversy, especially among liberal feminists, radical feminists,
and theorists of intersectionality.</p>

<h3 id="HumRigCitPolEqu">2.1 Human Rights, Citizenship, and Political Equality</h3>

<p>
International recognition of human rights has been particularly
important as a means to achieve equal citizenship and political rights
for women across the globe. Adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in
1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
commits all states parties to ensure the equal right of men and women
to the enjoyment of civil and political rights. Extending rights
protection beyond civil and political rights are other international
instruments such as the United Nations Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which entered
into force in 1981. In addition to CEDAW, the Palermo Protocol
supplement to the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime
directly addresses sex and labor trafficking. The U.N. Convention on
the Rights of the Child, entering into force in 1990, directs
particular attention to protecting children and families in difficult
social conditions. The 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence
Against Women was a resolution of the U.N. General Assembly to
strengthen implementation of CEDAW by committing states to condemn
physical, sexual, and psychological violence against women. These
international agreements have been bolstered by the work of
international groups, both NGOs and government-sponsored (see, e.g.,
the links in the
 <a href="#rightsgroups">other Internet Resources</a>
 to Center for Reproductive Rights, Futures without Violence,
Gendercide Watch, Human Rights Watch, National Network to End Domestic
Violence, Wild for Human Rights, and WomenWatch).</p>

<p>
The cumulative result of these efforts has been to commit states
across the globe to human rights and their realization. Only seven
nations, including Iran, Sudan, Somalia, and the United States have
not ratified CEDAW. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been
ratified by all nations except Somalia and the United States. The
United States has not ratified treaties that protect social or
economic rights, although it has committed not to undermine their
efficacy; among the treaties listed here, the United States has only
ratified the ICCPR.</p>

<p>
While feminists hail moves to further equality in international law,
critical feminists charge that in many societies commitments to human
rights are shallow. Adoption of human rights instruments may mask the
continued flourishing of patriarchal domestic laws (Engle 2005; Otto
2005). In some cultures, women are still not equal citizens. Some are
unable to vote, hold office, attend school, engage in business, or
move about freely. Some do not control their own reproductive lives,
access by others to their bodies, their pursuit of education, or the
opportunity for any life ambition other than marriage that may have
been arranged for them. The return of the Taliban to power in
Afghanistan in 2021 served as a stark reminder of the fragile progress
made by women in many societies.</p>

<p>
The emphasis on rights as a means to address oppression also has been
questioned. Scholars point out that human rights tend to emphasize
issues in the public sphere, leaving untouched traditional forms of
silencing in private life (Cr&eacute;pin 2020). On the other hand,
liberals defending the importance of rights to victims of oppression
are joined by critical race theorists such as Patricia Williams (1991)
who point out the central role of rights in overcoming histories of
discrimination and racism.</p>

<p>
Moreover, achievement of rights to equal citizenship leaves open
whether equality requires more. An initial liberal feminist approach
was to challenge overt legal restrictions on women or different
treatment of women and men (Taub &amp; Williams 1993; Smith 1993;
Bartlett &amp; Kennedy 1991). For example, in the US feminist lawyers
following the lead of later-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued
successfully that statutes treating women differently for estate
administration or age of majority violated constitutional equal
protection, <em>Reed v. Reed</em> (404 US 71 (1971)). US feminists,
however, did not succeed in passing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)
to the Constitution to put sex discrimination on the same legal
footing as race discrimination. The ERA foundered on assertions that
differences matter to issues as diverse as military service, child
support, or bathroom use (Mayeri 2011; Frug 1992). These issues
motivated conservative opposition, but feminists emphasizing class
differences and labor rights also were concerned that hard-won
benefits for women could be jeopardized. Critical race theorists
argued that formal equality for women failed to understand the complex
intersectionality of discrimination against women of color (Mayeri
2011). Critics of patriarchy insisted that histories of discrimination
were central to understanding the functioning of male norms in social
institutions from the family to employment to political
structures.</p>

<p>
Across the globe, there are similar debates about what more is
required beyond formal equality of citizenship. CEDAW&rsquo;s (1979)
requirement for the elimination of &ldquo;all forms&rdquo; of
discrimination against women has been a framework for these debates.
These debates are complicated, moreover, by judgments that ways of
understanding human rights norms may incorporate so-called western
values and are incompatible with legitimate cultural differences.
Whether and how theories of rights can accommodate cultural
differences has been given considerable attention by feminist
political philosophers (Mookherjee 2009; Ackerly 2008) and is
centrally relevant to the understanding of international human rights
norms and their role in law.</p>

<p>
Beyond equal citizenship, feminist jurisprudence also criticizes legal
or political structures that would put disproportionate burdens on
women or children seeking to live or to become citizens in countries
other than their country of origin. Here, feminists demonstrate how
asylum or refugee policies may be based on male models of what
constitutes persecution, discounting forms of structural injustice
that disproportionately affect women (e.g., Parekh 2012; J. Freedman
2008).</p>

<h3 id="Mar">2.2 Marriage</h3>

<p>
Nowhere than in marriage is the legal bias towards the status quo more
apparent, yet many jurisdictions across the globe now recognize same
sex marriage. Since Denmark first instantiated legal rights for same
sex partnerships in 1989 and the Netherlands legalized same-sex
marriages in 2001, thirty-six countries have implemented full marriage
equality. The United States became a part of this group in 2015,
<em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em>, 576 US 644 (2015). The Human Rights
Campaign maintains an
 <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/marriage-equality-around-the-world" target="other">updated interactive map</a>
 listing the status of marriage equality around the world. Recognition
of marriage equality, however, is not the same as recognition of
equality in other respects. In many US jurisdictions, for example,
legal protection for marriage equality does not extend to protection
against adverse decisions by employers, evictions, or refusals of
service by other private actors, <em>303 Creative LLC v. Elenis</em>,
600 U.S. __ (2023).</p>

<p>
Support for marriage equality has been criticized by feminists who
argue that marriage itself is a fundamentally inegalitarian
institution. Critics urge that marriage itself must be rethought if
gendered inequalities are to be overcome (Brake 2012). Valorizing
marriage also potentially harms those whose relationships take other,
less valued forms, such as asexual relationships, polyamorous
relationships, or care networks (Brake 2012). People in these other
relationship structures will not have the advantage of legal
entitlements such as retirement income or child custody if they are
dependent on marriage.</p>

<h3 id="RepRigConAboInfAbiRaiChiSafHeaEnv">2.3 Reproductive Rights: contraception, abortion, infertility, and the ability to raise children in safe and healthy environments</h3>

<p>
Access to contraception is critical for people to control their
reproductive lives. According to a United Nations report issued in
2020 (United Nations 2020), just under half of women of reproductive
age across the globe were using some form of contraception. Yet access
varied significantly by region, with only 29% of women in sub-Saharan
Africa using some form of contraception. Cultural norms, religious
objections, costs, and myths about safety are primary barriers to
increased contraceptive use. In countries without universal access to
health care, such as the United States, cost may be a barrier to
contraceptive use. Feminists point out that the burdens of
contraception and contraceptive failure fall primarily on women and
that there is need for increased support for male involvement in
family planning as well as for the development of effective
contraception for men.</p>

<p>
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights
 (<a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/" target="other">CRR Abortion Laws</a>
 2025), countries around the globe take very different views about
protection for abortion rights. In Mexico, the Supreme Court
recognized a constitutional right to abortion in 2021; individual
states in that federalist system continue to revise their laws to
comply with this ruling. Elsewhere in Latin America, Columbia and
Argentina recognize abortion rights, while Honduras and Nicaragua
prohibit abortion entirely and Brazil and Chile permit it only to save
the mother&rsquo;s life. In most of Europe (except Poland), Canada,
Australia, and South Africa, abortion is widely permitted, whereas in
much of the rest of Africa it is not.</p>

<p>
In the United States, the <em>Dobbs</em> rejection of constitutional
protection for reproductive choice removed legal barriers to
patriarchal state interference in private reproductive choices. With
<em>Dobbs</em>, the US moved in a direction contrary to the trend in
countries as varied as Argentina, Thailand, Mexico, or Colombia that
have liberalized abortion laws. As of 2023, the US abortion landscape
was changing quickly, with some states enacting strict bans beginning
from conception and without significant exceptions, even for
pregnancies resulting from rape. These laws stop short of punishing
pregnant people for obtaining abortions, perhaps inconsistently if
abortion is judged to be murder, but patients reportedly face
prosecution for attempting to use medication to self-manage abortions
or for conduct during pregnancy characterized as child abuse (Dewan
&amp; Frenkel 2022). (The language used here is pronoun-neutral
because people who identify their gender as male but who are
biologically female may become pregnant.) Other US jurisdictions are
responding to <em>Dobbs</em> with protections for providers offering
abortions and their patients.</p>

<p>
Feminists also point out that reproductive choices may be constrained
not only by law but also by patriarchal norms or social circumstances.
People may be coerced into having sex, bearing children, or leaving
work to care for families. A preference for male over female
offspring, including sex selective abortion, may be culturally
enforced. Economic instability may dictate the need for abortion by
those who would otherwise prefer to carry pregnancies to term.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, conservative feminists (e.g., Bachiochi 2021: 259)
raise concerns that abortion access may further <em>laissez faire</em>
attitudes about sex, leaving the woman to pick up the pieces when sex
leads to pregnancy. In a similar vein, Harvard Law professor Mary Ann
Glendon (1987) argued that the French and other civil law systems
historically expressed respect for persons by limiting abortion
subject to important exceptions to protect women.</p>

<p>
The abortion issue raises questions about how law should deal with
issues of deep moral disagreement within society, such as the status
of the fetus and the role of religion in public life. Some societies
expressly incorporate religious law into their legal systems or
operate dual systems. Others are secular but must work with strong
customary elements. In nations with strong religious or customary
influences on law, feminists may face difficult issues of how to call
on international human rights norms or to interpret religious law into
language more favorable to women&rsquo;s freedom (Quraishi 2011). Some
innovative work has been done on these issues, for example, by
exploring the distinction between <em>shari&rsquo;a</em> (eternal) law
and <em>fiqh</em> (custom or jurisprudence) in Islam, or by
considering the interplay of dual systems (Quraishi 2011; Mir-Hosseini
2006; Reed 2002; Jeffery &amp; Basu 1998).</p>

<p>
Feminists of color have brought an intersectional lens to these
debates about reproduction. Led by the SisterSong Reproductive Justice
Collective, activists of color argue that reproductive justice
requires that people be able to have the children they want, to not
have children they do not want, and to parent their children in safe
and healthy environments (Ross &amp; Solinger 2017). On this view,
lack of access to health care, safe housing, food security, clean
water, or infertility care, is reproductive injustice that bears most
heavily on people of color. These intersectional feminists view some
&ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; positions as myopic in their primary focus on
abortion.</p>

<p>
An understanding of reproductive justice that includes access to care
for sexual health and fertility encompasses infertility prevention and
treatment. Many issues about infertility care raise controversies
among at least some feminists. One disputed area is whether having
genetically or gestationally related offspring is sufficiently
important to human wellbeing to warrant support for treatment from
shared resources. Some argue that adoption should be viewed as an
available alternative and that the desire for genetically related
children is a hold-over from patriarchal inheritance structures.
Others argue that it is unjust to deny treatment to those who cannot
reproduce without help because they are single, in a same sex
relationship, or are physically unable to conceive or carry a child
(for discussion of these issues, see, e.g., Baron 2023). Still other
feminists point out the ethical problems of relying on adoption as an
alternative to parenting, including problematic shaming of birth
parents who relinquish children for adoption (Haslanger 2022).</p>

<p>
Another area of controversy among feminists concerns methods of
infertility care, particularly gamete provision and surrogacy. Critics
contend that language such as gamete &ldquo;donation&rdquo; is
misleading, for these practices commodify the body. Some neoliberal
theorists urge that if paid sex, paid surrogacy, paid gamete donation,
and the like can be achieved voluntarily, these are legitimate forms
of economic opportunity. To prohibit them is to deprive some
people&mdash;primarily women&mdash;of opportunities that might be of
value to them and to deprive the biologically and socially infertile
of the ability to form families. Feminists critical of this liberal
position argue that commodification mistakenly understands the body as
the subject of property&mdash;despite the all-too-apparent reality
that alternatives to commodification may be worse (Radin 1996).
Relatedly, some contend that commodification of the body in practices
such as paid surrogacy is inherently exploitative (Dickenson 2007) or
degrading (E. Anderson 1990). These and other feminists also criticize
apparent technological imperatives apart from the economic incentives
that may be driving them. Some contend that practices such as
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, transplants of mitochondrial DNA,
or gene editing are far riskier both physiologically and ethically
than proponents admit (e.g., De Melo-Martin 2016). These feminists
point out that long-term evidence of safety is lacking and that these
practices may portend far-reaching changes in our understanding of
what it is to be human. Some liberal feminists, on the other hand,
argue that individual&rsquo;s choices about the reproductive risks
they are willing to take should be respected, especially when they are
striving to avoid disease in their potential offspring.</p>

<p>
Across the globe, countries vary in the extent to which they permit
surrogacy. France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and many other
countries prohibit surrogacy. Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and
Australia permit altruistic but not paid surrogacy (Rahim 2024).
People who cannot get surrogacy services at home may seek services
abroad, but such travel for services is controversial. The
conservative Italian government in power in 2024 favors a ban on out
of country surrogacy. There is no international regulation of
cross-border surrogacy and critics are especially concerned about
risks of exploitation of women in poorer countries paid to be
surrogates (Rahim 2024).</p>

<h3 id="Pro">2.4 Prostitution</h3>

<p>
Feminists fragment significantly on issues involving commercialization
of sex.
 <a href="../feminist-sex-markets/#ShouSomeSexMarkProh">Prostitution</a>
 is one such area where feminists have taken different positions.
Liberals, whether or not they are also feminists, disagree on whether
prostitution should be viewed as just another commercial activity that
people should be free to engage in as long as they do so with full
consent and without harming others, or whether prostitution is a case
in which paternalistic intervention may be justified to protect people
from themselves (de Marneffe 2010; Gauthier 2013). Liberals also
question whether choices to engage in sex work can be genuinely
voluntary or result from coercive economic conditions. Still others
argue that legal prohibition of even voluntary prostitution is
necessary to protect victims of sex trafficking, as legalized
prostitution may mask continued flourishing of trafficking in its
shadow (Dempsey 2010). The Netherlands and Germany, countries that
have legalized prostitution, have engaged in vigorous debates about
whether prostitution is a voluntarily chosen occupation for many,
whether legalization has bettered the circumstances for prostitutes,
and whether legalization has been sufficiently coupled with enhanced
enforcement of laws against sex trafficking or other sex crimes. In
contrast, Sweden has banned prostitution altogether, spurred by
feminist critique of the practice, but has met criticism that the
result has been to drive the practice underground where it has become
more dangerous. Some feminists have contended that criminalization may
harm sex workers if the threat of law enforcement deters them from
getting needed medical treatment or other help if they are raped,
exploited, or trafficked (Ahmed 2014). Instead, these critics suggest,
criminalization should be directed towards sex trafficking for the
harms it causes its victims.</p>

<p>
Other feminist thinkers have developed arguments that commercial sex
work is wrong even if people would freely choose to engage in it. S.
Anderson (2002), for example, argues that restrictions on commercial
sex work further sexual autonomy because they prevent economic
pressures to be used to alter a person&rsquo;s sexual choices. For
Anderson, sex is not just another use of the body that can be
commercialized, like lifting heavy objects. Gauthier (2011) contends
that patrons of sex workers demand false sexual self-expression that
is discriminatory because sex workers are expected to express
attitudes demanded by patrons exercising dominance. Both of these
writers, however, also point out that the wrongfulness of prostitution
may not be sufficient to support its criminalization if the harms of
law enforcement may outweigh the harms of prostitution. Radical
feminists (e.g., Overall 1992) take the still stronger position that
prostitution institutionalizes sexual subordination and thus is wrong.
To the extent that these views have been stated in terms of the
patriarchal subordination of women, they would need to be extended to
cover cases of cis-male and trans-male prostitution.</p>

<h3 id="PorObs">2.5 Pornography and Obscenity</h3>

<p>

 <a href="../pornography-censorship/">Pornography</a>
 also divides feminists. Divisions begin with the definition itself:
is it sexually explicit material, the depiction of sexualized bodies
as means for arousal, misogynistic sex, or the sexually explicit
subordination of women&mdash;or is some other way of defining it more
appropriate? (Watson 2010) Conceptual divisions also address whether
obscenity is a separate kind of hard-core pornography that lacks
social value altogether (Altman &amp; Watson 2019). Debates continue
with whether and how pornography should be addressed legally. As with
prostitution, some liberals argue that it is unjustifiably
paternalistic to interfere with peoples&rsquo; ability to read or see
what they want if others are not harmed. These liberals may also
privilege freedom of expression. Other feminists criticize pornography
for the attitudes of consumers that it fosters; for example, Cawston
(2019) argues that pornography both reflects sexist attitudes and
conceals the recognition of these attitudes as sexist by distancing
the consumer from the acts of sex.</p>

<p>
Censorship laws vary widely, with communist and religiously
conservative countries having the most restrictive laws. Laws
addressing child pornography, access by minors to pornography, and
exploitation of participants in pornography are common. The European
Union regards child pornography as a violation of the fundamental
rights of children and directs
 (<a href="#EU2011">Directive 2011/92/EU</a>)
 member state to undertake action to prevent or prohibit the promotion
of the sexual abuse of children. Pornography is legal in the UK, but a
2024 review
 (<a href="#ukporn">UK 2024</a>)
 seeks evidence of whether efforts to prevent underage access, abuse
and human trafficking in the industry are adequate. Pornography is
legal in Canada but in 2024 the Canadian legislature considered
increasing enforcement of age limits on access to pornography over the
Internet. Waltman (2021) offers a comparative analysis of the
connections between pornography and sex inequality in the US, Canada,
and Sweden, and considers why democracies fail to address the harms of
pornography.</p>

<p>
The US has been a focal point for debates about pornography, with
civil libertarians campaigning against limitations on sex and sexually
explicit material (Bracewell 2016). On the other side, dominance
feminists argue that pornography is the quintessential example of
objectification and oppression. These feminists claim that pornography
exploits women, children, other vulnerable adults, or their images in
its production. It portrays them in positions of subservience and
ravishment. And it encourages postures of dominance, sexual
harassment, discrimination, and exploitation on the part of viewers.
On these views, pornography both causes harm and is inherently harmful
to those who participate in its making, those who consume it, and
those who live in societies that are influenced by the attitudes it
engenders. In the 1980s, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin
drafted a proposed ordinance for cities that characterized pornography
as a violation of civil rights. The ordinance as proposed did not
criminalize pornography; rather, it provided a civil damages remedy
for violations. Its proponents thus argued that it empowered victims
rather than relying on the oppressive power of the state (Bracewell
2016: 36). This ordinance was enacted in Indianapolis but struck down
by a federal appellate court as impermissibly regulating speech based
on its content, <em>American Booksellers Association, Inc. v.
Hudnut</em>. That the ordinance&rsquo;s feminist opposition to female
subordination was misconstrued as a moralistic condemnation of certain
forms of sex, its proponents contended, illustrated the failure to
appreciate the difference between moralism about sex and opposition to
masculinist domination in sex. In response to pornography, these
feminists suggested developing better models of masculinity (MacKinnon
&amp; Siegel 2004; Estrich 2000).</p>

<p>
In the wake of <em>Hudnut</em>, some liberal legal theorists such as
Cass Sunstein or Elena Kagan (now Justice Kagan) supported laws
against speech that was directly linked to public harms (Bracewell
2016: 39). &ldquo;Hate&rdquo; crimes enhance punishment when an
identified crime also expresses animus towards a disfavored group. In
the view of more radical feminist critics, this approach reinvokes the
problematic distinction between the public sphere and the private
sphere drawn by liberals in the tradition of Mill. Bracewell (2016)
observes that this liberal turn towards advocating the criminalization
of particular forms of harmful speech may parallel other invocations
of the criminal law by feminists in countering sexual harassment,
domestic violence, or sex trafficking.</p>

<p>
Generative artificial intelligence and robotic technologies that allow
highly realistic simulations of degrading or violent sexual acts
present additional challenges for critique. These depictions do not
require human performance for their production and thus do not
directly harm actors. Some argue that creating or viewing these
materials nonetheless should be criminalized as wrongful conduct
(Danaher 2017). Mistreatment of people involved in their production,
however, may be the least of the harms associated with these
technologies. Especially concerning is that artificial intelligence
allows for the creation of extremely harmful &ldquo;deep fake&rdquo;
likenesses of individuals. Created without the individuals&rsquo;
involvement, these may appear as realistic images of their bodies or
their activities. They thus may shame, stigmatize, or encourage
violence against their targets and come under the harm principle in
this way.</p>

<h3 id="SexHarMeTMov">2.6 Sexual harassment and the &ldquo;;#MeToo&rdquo; movement</h3>

<p>
In 1979, Catharine MacKinnon published her groundbreaking work
identifying the phenomenon of sexual harassment (MacKinnon 1979).
Naming the phenomenon helped people to recognize that common forms of
behavior&mdash;unwelcome touches, comments on appearance, persistent
sexual innuendos, pressures to date or have sex&mdash;added up to
patterns of discrimination, thus correcting
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/">hermeneutical injustice</a>
 (Fricker 2007). Legal recognition of sexual harassment as a form of
discrimination based on sex soon followed in the US and in many other
jurisdictions. Critics argued that this legal doctrine had become
over-expanded into chilling camaraderie and social interchange. In
reply, law professor Vicki Schultz (1998, 2003) argued that the law of
sexual harassment should not be interpreted as legal moralism
enforcing prudish judgments. Instead, sexual harassment should be
conceptualized to prohibit conduct that excludes women as unwelcome in
masculinized places, including places of work.</p>

<p>
The #MeToo movement, originally founded by activist Tarana Burke as
support for victims of sexual violence, caught fire in 2017 with
actress Alyssa Milano&rsquo;s invitation on Twitter to respond if
you&rsquo;ve been sexually harassed or abused. #MeToo reports often
highlight sexual overtures or pressures by dominant men; Schultz
(2018) has reemphasized the need to see these behaviors as part of
general patterns of sex-based hostility and structural injustice in
male-dominated workplaces. The movement has resulted in prominent
entertainment industry magnates such as Harvey Weinstein (Brown 2022)
and prominent political figures such as New York governor Andrew Cuomo
or Conservative Member of Parliament David Warburton being called to
task for their behavior. Epistemic controversies about #MeToo
continue, with arguments both for the importance of due process for
the accused and for epistemic justice to victims whose stories may be
too readily disbelieved (K. Freedman 2020; see generally Hoskins,
Woolfrey, &amp; Hoskins [eds] 2021).</p>

<h3 id="DomVio">2.7 Domestic Violence</h3>

<p>
A core function of the state and the criminal law is protection of
individuals from harm. Until the twentieth century, however, women
were largely left unprotected from a frequent source of danger, their
intimates. Indeed, for much of history these private threats to the
personal security of women were not recognized as harms that it was
the business of the state to address. Concomitantly, for liberal
theorists among others the realm of the home was private space to be
insulated from state incursion. Extensive feminist legal scholarship
and efforts at reform reveal, criticize, and change how legal systems
fail to protect women, girls, and more recently LGBTQ+ people, from
intimate violence. Nonetheless, rates of domestic violence remain
disturbingly high worldwide; the World Health Organization estimated
in 2021 that nearly one third of women in relationships reported being
subjected to some form of physical or sexual violence from their
intimate partners (WHO 2021: xvi).</p>

<p>
How law should intervene to counter the threat of intimate partner
violence is not obvious, however, especially when viewed through an
intersectional lens. On the one hand, partners and children may be
severely injured both psychologically and physically if violence is
allowed to persist. Use of the force of the criminal law against
alleged perpetrators seems an obviously justified response. From the
1960s on, feminists organized against domestic violence, seeing it as
a manifestation of intentional control by masculine aggressors against
the women they battered. These feminists argued that domestic violence
should be met with criminalization of offenders and treatment, along
with shelters and other services for battered women and children.
Feminists also supported policies of mandatory arrest and &ldquo;no
drop&rdquo; prosecution of alleged offenders, even when victims did
not want prosecutions to continue and refused to testify. Feminists
continued to press arguments against police inconsistencies and
apparent unwillingness to arrest and prosecute (Dempsey 2016).</p>

<p>
On the other side, the emphasis on law enforcement can be criticized
for risking escalation of the situation, harm to the victim or others,
discriminatory treatment of the alleged offender in the criminal
justice system, and over-policing of Black men and women. US data
indicate that the introduction of mandatory arrest policies may have
led to sharp increases in arrest rates of both alleged victims and
alleged perpetrators (Goodmark 2023: 11). In response to these
concerns, some feminist scholars have argued for re-examining
criminalization as an approach to domestic violence. Political
scientist Kristin Bumiller (2008) has argued that feminist movements
against sexual violence have unwittingly served neoliberal agendas of
increasing the reach of the carceral state and the surveillance of
vulnerable women. Feminist social work scholar Linda Mills (2003: 13)
has contended that in intimate violence the perpetrator is not
&ldquo;the cause and the sum of the violence he inflicts&rdquo;.
Instead, according to Mills, intimate violence occurs in relationships
that are both dynamic and set within social contexts. Recognizing the
context in which domestic violence occurs, Mills contends, can help to
explain both why women stay in relationships and why women are at
times not only abused but also abusers. Mills recommends exploring
restorative justice models instead of incarceration for domestic
violence when incarceration is not needed to prevent continued harm.
(See further discussion in the entries on
 <a href="../legal-punishment/">legal punishment</a>
 and
 <a href="../reconciliation/">reconciliation</a>.)
 Also widening the viewpoint, feminist criminal justice scholar Leigh
Goodmark (2018) has argued that domestic violence should be seen
through many lenses&mdash;as economic, public health, community, and
human rights issues&mdash;and not just as a problem for the criminal
law. Goodmark (2023) also explores the complex circumstances of
&ldquo;imperfect victims&rdquo; who are both victims of domestic
violence and are criminally punished for actions against their
accusers, or who otherwise fail to meet stereotypes of innocent
victimization. Such &ldquo;imperfect victims&rdquo; may also be those
who have engaged in commercial sex, who have engaged in acts judged
criminal while being trafficked, or who do not fit cis-gender norms.
&ldquo;Abolition feminists&rdquo; (Davis, Dent, Meiners, &amp; Richie
2021) shed light on how criminalization of domestic violence has been
disproportionately directed towards Black men. In the view of these
authors, feminists should advocate for change that takes multiple,
layered steps against racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia,
xenophobia, incarceration for disability&mdash;and the prison
industrial complex.</p>

<p>
Michelle Dempsey (2009) argues that when victims do not support
prosecutions of domestic violence, prosecutors should respond as
feminists. By this, she means that prosecutors should act on reasons
guided by a commitment to reconstitute their communities to lessen the
influence of patriarchy in the form of structural inequality that
systematically limits women&rsquo;s lives. In developing her argument,
Dempsey draws on her own experience as a prosecutor who had pursued
strong pro-prosecution policies and been met with objections from
victims, defense lawyers, and judges. In response, she shifted to
policies of exercising prosecutorial discretion to pursue primarily
cases of wife-battering in which the victim was in a stereotypical
relationship of gender power imbalance: staying home and attending to
childcare, being denied her own friends and money, being forbidden to
travel alone, and being subjected to suffering. Her book is motivated
by the effort to understand whether this approach can be justified as
feminist prosecutorial reasoning. Dempsey works with an account of
practical reason on which the realization of value provides reason to
act. For prosecutors, values are not only consequential&mdash;the
possibility of prevention of harm&mdash;but also intrinsic: the
attempt to realize good consequences, the expressive function of
denunciation of the violence, and the value of responding on behalf of
the community to the violence. Dempsey thus provides a feminist
account of prosecutorial reasons for action that supports neither
mandatory prosecution nor abolitionism.</p>

<h3 id="Rap">2.8. Rape</h3>

<p>
Rape and sexual assault also areas of substantive law where feminist
thinkers have achieved substantial reforms. Before reform efforts,
rape law was patently patriarchal. Marital partners were excluded from
rape prohibitions, on the misogynist assumptions that marriage created
an entitlement to sex or signaled consent to fulfillment of the
partner&rsquo;s desires. Estrich (1987) argued forcefully against the
view that attacks by strangers were paradigmatic of rape,
demonstrating that acquaintance rape could be &ldquo;real rape&rdquo;,
too, and not consensual sex.</p>

<p>
Despite reforms in the law of rape, rules of evidence remained hurdles
for victims whose claims were often disbelieved. For example, victim
resistance was expected as evidence that a sexual advance was
unwanted. Victims who did not actively resist&mdash;including those
who were terrorized or who feared harm from resistance&mdash;were
judged to have consented to whatever happened to them, or at least to
have reasonably appeared to their attackers as consenting (McGregor
2005). Evidence rules that permitted examination of victims&rsquo;
past sexual histories to impugn their credibility discouraged victims
from pursuing complaints when they did not want to reveal intimate
private matters or to be subjected to scrutiny of the morality of
their behavior. Victims who delayed reporting alleged rapes, perhaps
from shame or fear, were considered not to have made a fresh complaint
and thus to be less credible. Many of these rules have been formally
overturned but may in practice continue to infect decisions such as
whether to prosecute, how to examine witnesses, or how to assess the
credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p>
Insights from feminist epistemology continue to play a major role in
challenging the impact of credibility judgments. Fricker&rsquo;s
groundbreaking work on epistemic injustice (2007) has opened up
discussion of testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice, and
victim silencing. Testimonial injustice occurs when people are
discounted as credible because of stereotypes such as those rooted in
sex or race; it may also occur when people are assessed as overly
credible for similar reasons, likely to the detriment of the
credibility accorded others (Medina 2013). For example, a
woman&rsquo;s testimony may be discounted in allegations of rape if
she does not fit the stereotype of an innocent victim but the accused
fits the stereotype of a respectable citizen. To take another example,
claims of asylum seekers about threats they face in their home
countries may be disbelieved (Cr&eacute;pin 2020). Hermeneutical
injustice occurs when others do not even have the concepts to
understand what someone is saying, as when a victim of sex trafficking
claims she was coerced but police or immigration authorities can only
visualize her as an economic migrant. Black feminists such as Dotson
(2011, 2014, 2017) present powerfully detailed accounts of the role of
race in these forms of epistemic injustice.</p>

<p>
Contemporary discussions of rape continue to explore questions about
consent and the wrongfulness of rape. Application of the criminal law
requires bright-line judgments of guilt or innocence, with serious
consequences for the accused and the victim, yet there may be
ambiguities about consent. Some feminists have argued that there is a
domain of wrongful sex beyond rape; Cahill (2016, 2001), for example,
develops an account of sex as unjust within contexts of structural
injustice. Forms of unjust sex may within a gray area about consent;
Cahill distinguishes cases in which the woman is less than fully
willing, cases in which the woman&rsquo;s will is clearly overcome,
and cases in which the victim cannot fully consent due to incapacity.
What distinguishes among these cases, Cahill says, is how the
victim&rsquo;s sexual agency is deployed. Sex is unjust if the
woman&rsquo;s sexual agency is actively sought but undermined, such as
when it is difficult for her to express unwillingness. Parties under
the influence of drugs or alcohol also may be unable to exercise full
agency. Lack of respect for sexual agency has also been used to
explain why rape is wrongful even if it (hypothethically) takes place
in a manner that does not harm victims either physically or
psychologically, as when they are unconscious and never aware of
having been sexually assaulted (Heyes 2016). Rape is more than
assault; it attacks personhood and shatters identity (Brison
2022).</p>

<p>
In the wake of <em>Dobb</em>s, some US states have enacted abortion
prohibitions that do not include exceptions for rape. Being forced to
carry a pregnancy resulting from the bodily violation of rape is a
further suppression of women&rsquo;s agency. Some states only permit
abortions for rape when the occurrence has been reported to law
enforcement; these rules express disbelief of victims&rsquo;
credibility. The most humiliating of all of these provisions is an
Idaho law that allows family members of alleged perpetrators of rape
to sue physicians for statutory damages of $20,000 for the abortion of
the fetus in violation of the state&rsquo;s abortion ban,
 <a href="#IDCode">ID Code &sect; 18&ndash;8807</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="IneSocEcoLif">2.9 Inequality in Social and Economic Life</h3>

<p>
Inequality in social and economic life&mdash;in schools, public
accommodations, employment, housing, insurance, pensions, investment,
sports, the environment, and more&mdash;has been a widespread target
of feminist legal critique. Here, feminist analysis begins with
central theoretical questions about the meaning and justification of
equality amid difference, including supposed biological differences,
histories of discrimination, and entrenched social institutions.
Feminist legal responses have evolved from the removal of outright
barriers such as male-only public universities; to non-discrimination;
to attacking conditions, practices, and structures of injustice.</p>

<p>
Progress toward economic equality has been substantial in many parts
of the world; all but seven countries (the US, Iran, Sudan, Somalia,
Nauru, Palau and Tonga) are parties to CEDAW. Many of these have
adopted and implemented accompanying legislation but others have not.
Severe setbacks have occurred, including in countries that have
committed to CEDAW. In Afghanistan the return of Taliban rule has been
devastating for women and girls, who are now barred from most
education, employment, and travel. Overall, while women are active
participants and leaders in the public sphere in large numbers in many
societies, World Bank data (World Bank 2022
 [<a href="#Oth">OIR</a>])
 indicate that across the globe just over 50% of women of working age
are in the labor force compared to 80% of men, and women continue to
earn significantly less than men.</p>

<p>
In the US from the 1940s on, courts gradually began to enforce the
Equal Protection Clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment to apply
strict scrutiny to state-imposed categorizations based on race. Later
on, constitutional law began to address whether race and sex could be
analogized or even coupled for purposes of analysis (Mayeri 2011). The
Equal Rights Amendment would have applied strict scrutiny to
discrimination on the basis of sex, but has not been ratified by a
sufficient number of states. Although sex is given heightened
constitutional scrutiny, it is not given strict scrutiny; sex
discrimination in the US has been addressed primarily through federal
and state statutes rather than constitutional adjudication. In 1963,
the US Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, amending the Fair Labor
Standards Act to prohibit unequal pay on the basis of sex for</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,
effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar
working conditions. (29 USC. &sect; 206(d) (2012))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Congress, in a dispute about comparable worth, left open the
interpretive question of whether this statute requires the same pay
for the same work or equal pay for substantially equivalent jobs, a
comparable worth standard.) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 followed the
next year, explicitly establishing rights not to be discriminated
against on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in
employment (Title VII). Prohibition of discrimination on the basis of
sex in educational programs receiving federal funding (Title IX of the
Civil Rights Act) followed in 1972; in 2010,
 <a href="#ACA1557">&sect; 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)</a>
 prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex by health care
providers receiving federal funding. This ACA provision was the first
time discrimination on the basis of sex had been prohibited in US
health care.</p>

<p>
Sex is but one of the grounds of discrimination addressed in
anti-discrimination law. Treating grounds of discrimination as
separable phenomena is problematic for establishing causation: if
someone was fired because she was black, female, and disabled, she
will be unable to establish that any single factor was the &ldquo;but
for&rdquo; cause of her dismissal. Moreover, intersectionality
theorists point out that discrimination based on sex and, say, race,
is not simply discrimination based on sex plus discrimination based on
race (Mayeri 2011; Matsuda 1987). Some feminists have pointed out as a
problem in particular of liberal feminism that much of its focus is
directed to sex discrimination as experienced by white, middle class,
professional women (J. Williams 2010; Roberts 2002).</p>

<p>
Beyond overt intentional discrimination,
 <a href="../implicit-bias/">implicit bias</a>
 plays continuing roles in differential experiences of men and women
in employment and in many other areas of social life. Illustrating the
role of implicit bias in evaluation is the famous discovery about
symphony orchestras that the number of women musicians selected rose
dramatically when applicants auditioned anonymously from behind a
screen (Goldin &amp; Rouse 2000). Especially after public condemnation
of the deaths of George Floyd and other Black women and men at the
hands of police, implicit bias training has been widely implemented.
Evidence about the durable efficacy of this training remains mixed at
best (Greenwald et al. 2022), indicating the difficulty of relying on
regulation to change behavior.</p>

<p>
Even without explicit or implicit bias, many longstanding, apparently
neutral policies may affect men and women differently. Policies
discouraging or prohibiting part time work, when consistently applied
to both men and women, may have quite different consequences for
parents with primary responsibility for childcare, thus disadvantaging
women disproportionately. The US continues to have a workplace
structured on the basis of the norms of the 1950s, assuming a
breadwinner husband and a wife at home taking care of the children
(Williams 2010). Flexible work schedules, predictable shifts,
consistent start and stop times, daytime work, or part-time work at
hourly rates or with benefits proportionately equivalent to those of
full-time workers simply are not available to much of the workforce in
the US or elsewhere. Moreover, the US, unlike other advanced
industrial societies, has no general statutory requirement for paid
family leave; the absence of this leave may prove particularly
burdensome in the aftermath of <em>Dobbs</em>. Claudia Goldin&rsquo;s
groundbreaking work on the complex factors involved in sex
inequalities in the workplace was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics
in 2023. Goldin traces the root of wage inequality for women in the US
to &ldquo;greedy work&rdquo; that consumes more and more time; she
argues that the solution requires restructuring work (Goldin 2021:
3).</p>

<p>
Covid-19 further exacerbated these economic differences between women
and men, as women struggled to maintain jobs while helping children
with education at home during school closures and attending to other
care-giving responsibilities. Goldin (2022) has argued that in the US
more educated women were stressed by these dual responsibilities,
while less educated women in jobs that did not allow them to work from
home were disproportionately affected economically. International
studies indicate that the availability of reliable and affordable
childcare is important to women&rsquo;s participation in the labor
force and that laws promoting these services have a small but positive
effect (Anukriti et al. 2023
 [<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>]).</p>
 
<p>
The economic disadvantages of women at work are reinforced by
disadvantages in family law. Divorce and child maintenance settlements
disproportionally leave women in poverty (Raday 2019). In some
societies the de-valued status of wives and daughters leaves them
without inheritance or property rights. In some countries, reforms of
inheritance laws have permitted widows to inherit and daughters to
inherit on an equal basis with sons. Although these reforms have been
slow-moving, evidence suggests that they have generated positive
outcomes for women (Giovarelli &amp; Scalise 2020). Despite the
efforts of feminists to propose pay scales for care work and reformed
family structures (e.g., Fineman 2004), uncompensated care work
burdens continue to fall disproportionately on women (Ferrant,
Pesando, &amp; Nowacka 2014).</p>

<p>
This de-valuation and invisibility contribute to the feminization of
poverty, a problem of global proportions. In 2022, United Nations
poverty data projected that in the aftermath of COVID just under 400
million women and girls&mdash;nearly 5% of the global
population&mdash;live in extreme poverty, as do just under 375 million
men and boys (UN Women 2022
 [<a href="#Oth">OIR</a>]).
 Many programs have been proposed and initiated to alleviate extreme
poverty, including opportunities for literacy, support for
contraception and other reproductive rights, formation of
women&rsquo;s unions and cooperative associations, and micro-lending.
Pioneers of micro-lending Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank received
the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Both scholars and international
organizations continue to see advancement of economic opportunities
through legal reforms as a critical aspect of addressing global
poverty.</p>

<h2 id="Con">3. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Law furthers social stability but may entrench norms of oppression.
Law can also be a necessary means for reform. Law can be an anchor to
the past or an engine for the future. Feminist legal philosophy
examines and reformulates theories of law and legal doctrines to
overcome entrenched bias and enforced inequality of the past as it
structures institutions for the future.</p>
