<div id="preamble">

<p>
To forgive is to respond in a particular way to someone who has
treated someone badly or wrongly. In paradigmatic cases, forgiveness
is a triadic relation between a wrong action &phi;, a wrongdoer and a
wronged victim; the victim forgives the wrongdoer for having done
&phi;. By forgiving, a victim can move on from &phi; while still
judging that it was a culpable wrong. It has been claimed that the
core of forgiveness is the giving up of certain negative emotions
towards the wrongdoer, or the forbearance of negative treatment of the
wrongdoer, or the restoration of the relationship with the wrongdoer,
or the alteration of the norms bearing on victim and wrongdoer. Much
philosophical discussion of forgiveness centers on three primary
questions: (1) What is the nature of forgiveness&mdash;what must one
do in order to forgive; (2) What is the scope of
forgiveness&mdash;when is one in a position to forgive and which
things can be forgiven; and (3) What are the norms governing
forgiveness&mdash;when is forgiveness morally good, right, or
praiseworthy?</p>

<h2 id="ForResWro">1. Forgiveness as a Response to Wrongdoing</h2>

<p>
An inevitable and unfortunate fact of life is that we are often
mistreated by others. In response to having been wronged, we might
resent, blame, seek revenge, impose punishment, and demand apology and
compensation. Forgiving stands in contrast as a less hostile, less
combative response to having been wronged. There are influential
religious and secular traditions, including Christianity and
therapeutic psychology, that strongly encourage victims to forgive.
Moreover, many wrongdoers hope to be forgiven for what they have done.
Forgiveness is frequently presented as allowing both victim and
perpetrator to recover from wrongdoing, perhaps reconciling, or at
least moving on in peace. Arguably, forgiveness is sometimes required
in order to restore or preserve valuable relationships and to end
cycles of revenge.</p>

<p>
Although interpersonal forgiveness is prominent in contemporary moral
discourse, it was neither examined nor encouraged by the Ancient
Greeks (Konstan 2010: 11; Griswold 2007b: 278), and was largely
ignored in the history of Western philosophy. The most significant
exception is Bishop Butler, who claims that forgiveness is
incompatible with revenge, but is compatible with sustained
proportionate anger (Butler 1726; Griswold 2007a: 19; Garcia 2011: 5).
(See Appendix 1: Forgiveness in the History of Western
Philosophy.)</p>

<p>
Even amongst contemporary advocates, there is great disagreement over
what forgiveness is supposed to be. According to the <em>Oxford
English Dictionary</em>, to &lsquo;forgive&rsquo; is to cease to
harbour resentment, to remit a debt, to pardon an offence, to make
excuse or apology for, or to regard indulgently. This dictionary
definition is strikingly broad. The remittance or cancellation of
financial debts is a separate phenomenon that falls outside of the
kind of forgiveness that philosophers and psychologists are interested
in; namely, forgiveness of wrongdoing. Some psychologists think that,
so long as we exclude the cancellation of debts, the broad dictionary
definition is correct. They suggest that a victim forgives simply by
getting over the wrong and moving on (McCullough et al. 2000: 9;
Billingsley et al. 2020: 54). In contrast, philosophers have offered a
range of more precise and restrictive definitions of forgiveness,
treating it as one special way of moving past wrongdoing. Philosophers
take great pains to distinguish forgiving from a range of related
phenomena, including excusing and pardoning. Many philosophers think
that forgiveness is morally complex and puzzling, and some question
whether it is paradoxical (Kolnai 1973/4: 99).</p>

<h2 id="RelPhe">2. Related Phenomena</h2>

<h3 id="Jus">2.1 Justification</h3>

<p>
If a stranger in a crowded marketplace deliberately treads on your
foot, you might respond with anger and blame. But if you then realise
that this stranger trod on your foot to catch your attention and
quietly alert you to the presence of a pickpocket, your reaction will
change. You now see that his action was justified, and that he did not
wrong you. Coming to see that an action is justified is one way of
overcoming resentment and blame, but it is not compatible with
forgiving the agent for that action. If the action was justified, then
there is nothing to forgive (Kolnai 1973/4: 95; Allais 2008: 34). When
we forgive someone for what they have done, we still judge that what
they did was wrong, or at least constitutes some kind of failure. This
is why it can be offensive when someone says that she forgives you for
having done something when what you did was not actually wrong.</p>

<h3 id="Exc">2.2 Excuse</h3>

<p>
Sometimes we react negatively to people who are doing things that are
indeed morally bad or impermissible, but we later come to see that
what they did was not actually their fault. In such cases, so-called
excusing conditions render the agent <em>not</em>
<em>blameworthy</em>. We typically excuse agents for what they have
done when they had no choice, when they acted under coercion, when
they were significantly cognitively impaired, or when they were
non-culpably ignorant of what they were doing (Strawson 1962: 192).
Coming to see that an agent ought to be excused is another way of
overcoming resentment and moving past blame.</p>

<p>
Most philosophers claim that excusing is not merely distinct from
forgiving, but is incompatible with forgiving. The forgiver moves on
while still judging that the wrongdoer is culpable and has no good
excuse (Strawson 1962: 191; Haber 1991: 33; Bash 2007: 5; Allais 2008:
36; Hieronymi 2001: 530; for the contrary view see Neblett 1974: 272;
Boleyn-Fitzgerald 2002: 486). Forgiving, unlike excusing, is an option
for victims when they know that the wrongdoer was to blame; the wrong
action <em>was</em> his fault. It might be suggested that a
victim&rsquo;s discovery of mitigating circumstances can lead her to
partially excuse while also partially forgiving the wrongdoer, but in
this case there remains an incompatibility between wholly forgiving
and wholly excusing (Russell 2023a: 37).</p>

<h3 id="For">2.3 Forgetting</h3>

<p>
Another way in which victims can move past the fact that they have
been wronged is by forgetting that it happened. It is widely held that
forgiving is distinct from forgetting, and that mere forgetting is not
sufficient for forgiving. Some even say forgiving is incompatible with
forgetting (Kolnai 1973/4: 100). Yet it is sometimes recommended that
a victim of wrongdoing forgive <em>and</em> forget, which suggests
that forgiving must be compatible with forgetting in some way (Lang
1994: 108). Blustein claims that forgiving requires a kind of
forgetting, or a restricted kind of remembering (2014: 101). Russell
proposes instead that &lsquo;forgive and forget&rsquo; should be read
as meaning forgive and then eventually forget (2023a: 43). At the time
of forgiving, the forgiver must still remember that she was culpably
wronged by the perpetrator. If this is correct, then forgetting is not
a way of forgiving, but forgiving is compatible with subsequent
forgetting.</p>

<h3 id="ParMer">2.4 Pardon and Mercy</h3>

<p>
The OED definition includes pardoning as a kind of forgiveness. In
contrast, philosophers take forgiveness to be distinct from pardon and
from the related concept of mercy. The word &lsquo;pardon&rsquo; can
refer to a familiar and important legal and political power quite
unlike forgiveness. Black&rsquo;s Law Dictionary defines this sense of
pardon as &ldquo;an act or an instance of officially nullifying
punishment or other legal consequences of a crime&rdquo;, ordinarily
&ldquo;granted by the chief executive of a government&rdquo; (Garner
1999: 1137). In the United States, for example, the President has the
authority to grant pardons for federal offenses, and state governors
may pardon crimes against the state. Unlike forgiveness, institutional
pardon and mercy can be exercised only by people who occupy the
requisite institutional roles. Many victims have no control over
whether the authorities will punish the wrongdoer, whereas the victim
can decide whether to offer forgiveness. This leads some philosophers
to claim that forgiveness and mercy work in different domains (Kolnai
1973/4: 93; Allais 2013: 650).</p>

<p>
However, the words &lsquo;pardon&rsquo; and &lsquo;mercy&rsquo; are
sometimes used to refer to the waiving of further informal retribution
by the victim of wrongdoing herself, independent of any institution.
This kind of interpersonal pardoning is compatible with forgiving, but
there is deep disagreement as to whether it is an essential feature of
forgiveness, or whether the victim can forgive while continuing to
punish and refusing to show mercy (see section 4.4 Forgiveness and
Behaviour). Several facts suggest that forgiving is distinct from
interpersonal pardoning and being merciful (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988;
158; Tosi &amp; Warmke 2017: 212). Pardon and mercy are essentially
overt, whereas forgiveness is sometimes private. It is possible to
show mercy to a wrongdoer only when the punishment has not already
been administered in full, but a victim can choose to forgive or to
refuse forgiveness even after the wrongdoer has finished receiving
full punishment (Allais 2008: 48). Arguably, it is possible to forgive
someone after they are dead, but it not clear that we could be
merciful to the dead.</p>

<h3 id="Rec">2.5 Reconciliation</h3>

<p>
Wrongdoing typically damages the relationship between the victim and
the wrongdoer, sometimes leading the victim to terminate that
relationship, to refuse to cooperate, or to simply avoid the
wrongdoer. Subsequent apology or even just the passage of time can
lead the victim to reconcile with the wrongdoer, restoring the
relationship to a state of harmony.</p>

<p>
This kind of reconciliation often accompanies or follows from
forgiveness. Nonetheless, reconciliation can occur without
forgiveness. Reconciliation can be the result of excusing or
justifying rather than forgiving. More contentiously, we might claim
that a fearful victim can choose to reconcile with the wrongdoer while
still resenting and feeling contempt for him, hence failing to forgive
him (Russell 2023a: 168).</p>

<p>
Some philosophers believe that reconciliation is an essential part of
forgiveness (Wilson 1988: 534; Calhoun 1992: 84). This restriction
would severely limit the availability of forgiveness, rendering
forgiving impossible when a hostile wrongdoer refuses to reconcile
with a willing victim, or when the wrongdoer is dead or otherwise
beyond communicative reach. The more common view is that it is
possible to forgive without reconciling, and even while refusing to
reconcile (Holmgren 1993: 342; Pettigrove 2012: 15). This makes
forgiveness more widely available and allows advocates of forgiveness
to claim that a victim can forgive a dangerous repeat offender without
having to re-enter the relationship and put herself at risk (Garrard
&amp; McNaughton 2011: 106).</p>

<h3 id="Con">2.6 Condonation</h3>

<p>
Forgiving is distinct from condoning, and many philosophers say that
it is incompatible with condoning. We might reach this conclusion by
assuming that forgiving is essentially a morally good or virtuous
response to wrongdoing, whereas condoning, by definition, is a morally
bad response (Kolnai 1973/4: 97&ndash;8; cf. Hieronymi 2001: 531).
Alternatively, we might think that forgiving is incompatible with
condoning on the grounds that a person who condones &phi; makes a
judgment that is not made by forgivers. Perhaps someone who condones
&phi; must mistakenly believe that &phi; was not morally wrong,
whereas the forgiver still judges that &phi; was wrong. Thus, it would
be impossible to forgive and condone one and the same action at the
same time (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 40; Holmgren 1993: 47; Govier
1999: 60; Garrard &amp; McNaughton 2010: 85; Cornell 2017: 247).</p>

<p>
Yet this argument rests on a contentiously narrow conception of
condonation (Griswold 2007a: 46). The language of condonation is also
used to criticise authority figures who <em>correctly</em> judge that
&phi; was wrong, but who decide to tolerate &phi;, or to impose only a
disproportionately mild punishment. To condone a wrong action, in this
sense, is to fail to resist it strongly enough (Russell 2023a: 65). If
this is what it means to condone &phi;, then there is no
straightforward incompatibility between forgiving and condoning.
Perhaps some victims condone the wrong (i.e. fail to resist it
strongly enough) by forgiving too readily (Lang 1994: 111; Novitz
1998: 305; Bennett 2018: 220). On this account, forgiving would be
distinct from condoning, but it would be possible for a victim to
forgive and condone one and the same offence.</p>

<h2 id="StaTar">3. Standing and Target</h2>

<p>
When a victim is wronged, unrelated third parties are able to rebuke,
blame, and punish the wrongdoer. In contrast, it is often assumed that
not just anyone can forgive the wrongdoer for having committed that
wrong. If your friend suddenly declared that she has forgiven the
Spanish Inquisitors for torturing heretics, you might wonder whether
she understands how forgiveness works. Who is she, you might ask, to
forgive these wrongs? In this case, your friend simply does not have
the standing to forgive (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 21).</p>

<p>
One thing that is sometimes meant by &lsquo;standing&rsquo; is
entitlement or right. In this sense, a hypocrite does not have the
standing to blame someone for doing what the hypocrite routinely does
himself. If the hypocrite does go ahead and blame the wrongdoer, he
does so inappropriately. However, this is not the meaning of
&lsquo;standing&rsquo; as it is usually used in relation to
forgiveness. When philosophers ask who has the standing to forgive
they are asking who is in a position to forgive, who is capable of
forgiving, or who might forgive, whether they do so rightly or
wrongly. (Pettigrove 2009: 583; Hughes 2016: 365; Russell 2020: 2; for
the contrary view see Fritz &amp; Miller 2022.) There are several
competing views about who has the standing (i.e. the ability) to
forgive.</p>

<p>
<em>Victim-Only Forgiveness</em>: It is often claimed that only the
victim has the standing to forgive the wrongdoer (Downie 1965: 128;
Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 21; Roberts 1995: 291, Owens 2012: 51;
Zaragoza 2012: 612). For example, if you physically assault me, then
only I have the standing to forgive you for that assault, because I am
the one whom you wrongfully assaulted. The idea that only the victim
has the capacity to forgive mirrors the claim that only the person to
whom the money is owed has the power to cancel that debt (Pettigrove
2009: 583). Often a wrong action harms a number of indirect or
secondary victims in addition to the direct victim. Perhaps we should
allow that indirect victims of the wrong action &phi; also have the
standing to forgive the wrongdoer for doing &phi;, on the assumption
that this is not a substitute for being forgiven by the direct victim
(Griswold 2007a: 118).</p>

<p>
<em>Forgiveness by Proxy</em>: Beyond this, we might wonder whether
someone who is not the direct victim could forgive on behalf of that
victim. For example, there are cases in which surviving family members
say that they forgive a murderer on behalf of the deceased victim
(Griswold 2007a: 119). Yet it is not clear that any purported proxy
actually has the standing to forgive on behalf of the victim. One
concern is whether a proxy can know what the victim herself would have
wished in these circumstances. Another problem arises when several
people claim to speak for the victim, and they disagree as to whether
the victim would have forgiven.</p>

<p>
<em>Suitably Related Third-Party Forgiveness</em>: In opposition to
the restrictive &lsquo;victim-only&rsquo; view on standing, some
philosophers have claimed that some third parties who are not even
indirect victims of &phi; nonetheless have the standing to forgive the
wrongdoer for having done &phi; (Govier 1999: 68; Garrard 2002: 149;
Allais 2008: 37; Pettigrove 2009: 594; Walker 2013: 49&ndash;6). This
seems more plausible when the third parties in question have an
association with the victim, or with the perpetrator, or have some
special commitment to combatting the kind of wrong that was committed.
These are grounds for saying that this instance of wrongdoing matters
to them personally, even though they were not wronged by it.</p>

<p>
In addition to these disagreements as to who can forgive, there are
further disputes as to <em>what</em> can be forgiven. We might think
that the victim forgives &phi;, the wrong action. Alternatively, it
could be that the victim forgives the wrongdoer. Both of these options
seem incomplete. For example, if you claimed that you have forgiven
the malicious gossip about you, we would assume that you have forgiven
the <em>gossipers</em> for saying what they said about you. If you
claimed that you have forgiven your sister, we would assume that you
have forgiven her <em>for</em> having done something. Thus, it seems
that the target of forgiveness is more complex: the victim forgives
the wrongdoer for having done &phi; (Griswold 2007a: 5&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
Beyond this, there are several disputes over the target of
forgiveness. Although Cornell has argued that pre-emptive forgiveness
is possible (2017: 241), the dominant view is that we can forgive
people only for past and present wrongdoing, not for future wrongs
(Griswold 2007a: 71). Another question concerns whether forgiveness is
always targeted at morally wrong <em>actions</em>, or whether we can
also forgive people for their non-voluntary but deplorable emotional
responses, for their vicious character traits, or for who they are
(Dillon 2001: 59; Bell 2008: 638; Pettigrove 2012: 41). These could be
grouped with morally wrong actions into the broader category of
culpable moral failings (Russell 2023a: 60). While it is broadly
accepted that the paradigmatic cases of forgiveness are targeted at
moral failings, it has been suggested that we also can forgive people
for letting us down or harming us in ways that were not morally wrong
(Haji 1998; Dillon 2001: 60).</p>

<p>
Another disagreement concerns whether forgiveness can be mistargeted.
Many philosophers claim that forgiveness only ever occurs in response
to actual moral failures, and never in response to things that are
mistakenly perceived to be moral failures (Downie 1965: 128; Londey
1986: 4; Bell 2008: 631; Allais 2013: 643). As Konstan puts it,
&ldquo;one cannot forgive an innocent person&rdquo; (2010: 2). We can
call this the view that forgiveness is morally factive. Arguably, most
other common responses to actions in this domain are <em>not</em>
morally factive. Resentment, blame, punishment, and apology are
sometimes directed at actions that are mistakenly perceived to be
wrong, but that are objectively permissible or even virtuous. For
example, protesters may complain that political prisoners are being
punished for heroically resisting a corrupt government. Some
philosophers have argued that forgiveness is similarly not morally
factive, in the sense that it is possible (but not appropriate) for
someone to forgive an agent for having done &phi; when &phi; is not
actually wrong (Pettigrove 2012: 5; Russell 2016: 708; Scarre 2016:
941). Allowing for the possibility of mistargeted forgiveness is
unattractive to those who assume that every act of forgiveness is
morally good, and to those who assume that forgiveness changes the
norms that bind the wrongdoer (e.g. Fritz &amp; Miller 2022: 776).</p>

<h2 id="TheFor">4. Theories of Forgiveness</h2>

<h3 id="WhaKinPosCha">4.1 What kind of positive change?</h3>

<p>
Most philosophers claim that the forgiver still judges that she was
wronged and still judges that the wrongdoer had no good excuse, but
has now moved on, gotten over it, or let it go. The forgiver no longer
holds the wrong against the wrongdoer. Let us hold this assumption
fixed throughout the remaining sections. In giving a more complete
account of forgiveness we must specify the relevant sense in which,
after forgiveness, the forgiver does not hold the wrong against the
perpetrator. There is enormous disagreement on this matter. Some
common but contested claims include the following:</p>

<ol type="A">

<li><em>Emotion</em>: forgiving necessarily includes moving past
particular kinds of negative emotion. Forgiveness requires
<em>feeling</em> more positively about the wrongdoer.</li>

<li><em>Judgments / Attitudes</em>: Forgiving necessarily includes
forming comparatively positive judgements about and attitudes towards
the wrongdoer. Forgiveness requires <em>thinking</em> more positively
about the wrongdoer.</li>

<li><em>Behaviour</em>: Forgiving necessarily includes moving past
particular kinds of negative treatment of the wrongdoer. Forgiveness
requires <em>acting</em> more positively towards the wrongdoer.</li>

<li><em>Normative Power</em>: Forgiving is a commitment and/or an
action that functions to change the <em>obligations</em> that bind the
victim and the wrongdoer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some philosophers believe that a single one of these claims captures
the sense in which the forgiver has moved on and no longer holds the
wrong against the perpetrator. Others endorse various combinations of
these claims.</p>

<h3 id="ForEmo">4.2 Forgiveness and Emotion</h3>

<p>
One common view is that forgiveness necessarily includes the loss,
reduction, or absence of certain negative emotions, with resentment
being the central candidate (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 21; Richards
1988: 79; Moore 1989: 184; Hughes 1993: 108; Darwall 2006: 72). We can
call this the view that forgiveness counteracts these negative
emotions. This view fits with the common claim that forgiveness
involves a change of heart (Kolnai 1973/4: 97), and that a victim who
forgives thereby attains a kind of inner peace.</p>

<p>
It would be possible to claim that this change in feelings is the only
positive movement that is required for forgiveness. Typically, though,
philosophers say that this change in feelings is necessary but not
sufficient, and that forgiveness also requires certain changes in
judgements (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 83&ndash;85), or changes in
judgments and behaviour (Hieronymi 2001: 551; Griswold 2007a: 53).
(For the contrary view that forgiveness is compatible with sustained
high levels of resentment and hostile feelings see Zaibert 2009: 388;
Cornell 2017: 264.) Amongst philosophers who think that forgiveness
counteracts negative emotions there is significant disagreement on two
main points: which specific emotions are counteracted by forgiveness,
and which kind of counteracting is necessary for forgiveness. We will
consider these two issues in turn.</p>

<p>
Which emotions are counteracted by forgiveness? There are numerous
negative emotions that one might experience after being wronged,
including hatred, anger, sadness, disappointment, and hurt. One
possible view is that forgiveness requires only that we overcome a
small subset of them&mdash;those emotions that might be best described
as vindictive, vengeful, malicious, spiteful, or hateful (e.g. Murphy
&amp; Hampton 1988: 82). This <em>hatred-focused account</em> may
appeal to philosophers who believe that all wrongdoing ought to be
forgiven. However, if the hatred-focused account were true, then
forgiving would be compatible with continuing to feel unabated high
levels of non-hateful anger towards the wrongdoer, a result that
strikes most philosophers as being implausible.</p>

<p>
Many contemporary philosophers believe that the key emotion
counteracted by forgiveness is resentment (Strawson 1962: 191;
Hieronymi 2001: 530; Bash 2007: 161). There is some disagreement
amongst philosophers of forgiveness as to whether resentment is
essentially a vindictive emotion that includes a desire for pay-back
(Garrard and McNaughton 2002; Murphy 2003: 16) or whether resentment
does not necessarily include a desire for retaliation (Holmgren 2012:
31). Let us proceed on the assumption that the relevant conception of
resentment is the Strawsonian reactive attitude, according to which
resentment is a moralised anger that is directed by the victim towards
a wrongdoer in light of a perceived failure by the wrongdoer to show
sufficient goodwill towards the victim (Strawson 1962: 191; Hughes
1993: 331; MacLachlan 2010: 425). Resentment, so conceived, is a
hostile emotion, but it need not include feelings of malice, hatred,
or vengefulness. Strawsonian resentment need not be brooding,
defensive, or secretive. Resentment is an emotion that it is possible
to conceal from others, but resentment typically primes victims to
engage in a range of confrontational behaviours including blaming,
rebuking, and asking for an apology (Warmke and McKenna 2013: 191).
Depending on the circumstances, the feeling of resentment might also
motivate the victim to punish, to ostracise, or to avoid the wrongdoer
(Griswold 2007a: 26; Russell 2019: 282). Strawson claims that only the
victim of wrongdoing is in a position to feel resentment, and that the
moralised anger that is felt by third parties who witness wrongdoing
should instead be classified as indignation (1962: 199).</p>

<p>
Strawson and Hieronymi offer a <em>resentment-focused accounts</em> of
forgiveness, according to which the only emotion counteracted by
forgiveness is resentment (Strawson 1962, 191; Hieronymi 2001:
54&ndash;6). A slightly broader alternative to this is a <em>moralised
anger-focused account</em>, according to which forgiveness counteracts
resentment, indignation, and other varieties of blame-feeling (Allais
2023: 216; cf. Hughes 1993: 334). Several philosophers say that
forgiveness also counteracts some hostile reactive attitudes that are
not varieties of anger. According to a <em>hostile reactive
attitudes-focused account</em>, a victim who forgives thereby
overcomes her resentment and indignation and also no longer feels
contempt or scorn for the wrongdoer (Griswold 2007a: 41; Bell 2008:
628; Pettigrove 2012: 6; McNaughton &amp; Garrard 2017: 112).</p>

<p>
Finally, we could adopt a significantly broader <em>negative
emotion-focused accounts</em> of forgiveness. According to this view,
forgiveness counteracts all negative emotions that a victim may have
felt towards the perpetrator on account of the wrongdoing in question.
Richards claims that not only must one overcome emotions like malice,
moral anger, and contempt in order to forgive, one must also overcome
sadness and disappointment, neither of which are hostile emotions
(1988: 77&ndash;79; also see Holmgren 1993: 341; Murphy 2003: 59). To
some critics, this seems too expansive. Forgiveness may well include
reaching a kind of inner peace and losing hostility towards the
wrongdoer, but lingering feelings of sadness and disappointment are
compatible with having forgiven and moved on (Hughes 1993: 334;
Pettigrove 2012: 7; Lippitt 2020: 148).</p>

<p>
The second main point of disagreement amongst advocates of
emotion-focused accounts concerns the way in which forgiveness
counteracts the negative emotions in question. Writers on forgiveness
have claimed that the forgiver forswears these negative emotions
(Strawson 1962: 191), or overcomes them (Murphy 2003: 16; Holmgren
1993: 341), or abandons them (Richards 1988: 184), or lets them go
(Griswold 2007a: 40), or eliminates them (Lauritzen 1987: 142). Most
of these formulations suggest that in order for forgiveness to be
possible, the victim must first feel the negative emotions. In
contrast, some have claimed that a victim can forgive immediately,
without first having felt resentment, indignation, or contempt, as is
common when a parent forgives their own child (Downie 1965: 133;
Roberts 1995: 290; Pettigrove 2012: 3). If instant forgiveness is
possible, then forgiveness might nonetheless entail the subsequent
absence or moderation of the relevant negative emotions, in which case
it would still make sense to say that forgiveness counteracts
resentment (Russell 2023a: 51).</p>

<p>
After the victim has forgiven the wrongdoer for &phi;, is it possible
for her to feel any further resentment over &phi;? One option would be
to claim that forgiveness entails the complete elimination or
subsequent absence of the relevant negative emotions, such that a
single twinge of resentment felt years later would imply that the
victim had never really forgiven. If this were true, forgiveness would
turn out to be rarer than many of us suppose and it would be difficult
even for a victim herself to know whether she has forgiven. It is more
common to claim that forgiveness results in either the subsequent
absence of resentment or its reduction to insignificant levels
(Holmgren 1993: 341&ndash;2; Pettigrove 2012: 18). However, if the
victim sincerely says &lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo; but her negative
emotions quickly resurface and persist at high levels, then the victim
did not actually forgive the wrongdoer in the first place (Lang 1994:
338; Govier &amp; Verwoerd 2002: 97; Scarre 2016: 932). Some
philosophers believe that it is possible for a victim to retract
forgiveness or &lsquo;unforgive&rsquo; in certain circumstances
(Scarre 2016: 941; Wonderley 2022: 478), in which case strong
resentment could resurface without negating the fact that the victim
was previously in the state of having forgiven the wrongdoer.</p>

<p>
Most philosophers say that only a special kind of reduction or
elimination of negative emotions will count as forgiveness. Were you
accidentally to fall and hit your head on a rock, thereby causing your
resentment to be eliminated, you would not have forgiven. Or if your
resentment simply withered away over the years via a process outside
of your control or ken, it is widely thought that you would not have
forgiven (cf. Horsbrugh 1974: 271). This is tied to the common claim
that forgiving is an <em>action</em>, that it is something that the
forgiver does rather than something that merely happens to her. Some
philosophers take this to mean that forgiving is under the voluntary
control of the forgiver (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 23; Hughes 1993:
333). Adams adds the claim that forgiving necessarily includes
&ldquo;agent effort&rdquo; (1991: 284). Perhaps instead the relevant
point is that forgiving is an action that is done <em>for a
reason</em>, regardless of whether it is effortful or under voluntary
control (Hieronymi 2001: 530; cf. Murphy 2001: 561). Some add that
forgiving is the removal of resentment via a commitment that is made
by the forgiver, who not merely overcomes but forswears these hostile
reactive attitudes (Adams 1991: 284).</p>

<p>
If forgiving centrally involves reducing your hostile emotions and
forgiving is a reason-governed action, we might conclude that
forgiving is a &ldquo;willed change of heart&rdquo; (North 1987: 506),
or that forgiving is the removal of hostile reactive attitudes for the
right kind of reason and in the right kind of way (Griswold 2007b:
276; Roberts 1995: 299). In this vein, Hieronymi claims that
&lsquo;ridding oneself of resentment by taking a specially designed
pill &hellip; would not count as forgiveness&rdquo; (Hieronymi 2001:
530). There is deep dispute as to which reasons for eliminating
resentment count as the kind that are essential for forgiveness.
According to Hieronymi, the forgiving victim&rsquo;s resentment is
revised away in light of information that reveals that the wrong
action no longer conveys a threatening message (Hieronymi 2001: 548).
Others claim that the forgiving victim&rsquo;s resentment is removed
for morally good reasons, which might include the fact that the
wrongdoer has repented and apologised (Griswold 2007a: 50), or that he
has suffered enough (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 24). Hampton adds that
forgiving is sometimes done for the sake of others, as when parents
forgive each other for the sake of their children (Murphy &amp;
Hampton 1988: 39). Many philosophers agree that, even if there is a
broader class of reasons for which people might choose to forgive,
forgiving is never done for selfish or &lsquo;therapeutic&rsquo;
reasons (Hughes 1993: 338; Richards 1988: 79; Bell 2008: 636; Milam
2018: 571). This has led some philosophers to propose that we
distinguish forgiveness from &lsquo;letting go of blame&rsquo;, which
is supposed to refer to what happens when victims remove their blame
and resentment for prudential reasons (Brunning &amp; Milam 2023:
725).</p>

<p>
These restrictive philosophical theories have been criticised on the
grounds that they exclude many common instances of forgiveness.
Therapists frequently recommend that victims forgive those who wronged
them for the sake of the victims&rsquo; own happiness. According to
this view, &lsquo;letting it go&rsquo; is not an alternative to
forgiving, but is just another way of forgiving. Regardless of whether
you think that such acts of forgiveness are morally admirable, it is
highly revisionary to claim that victims never forgive for prudential
reasons (Ingram 2013: 1070; Russell 2023a: 48). Arguably, some victims
forgive by removing their resentment in order to attain inner peace,
or in order to escape the burden of conflict (Pettigrove 2006:
488&ndash;9; Radzik 2009: 117; Garrard &amp; McNaughton 2011: 105;
Nelkin 2013: 169; Russell 2019: 283). Maybe some victims forgive by
manipulating themselves out of feeling angry, rather than by
rationally revising away their resentment (Novitz 1998: 308;
O&rsquo;Hagan 2019: 539). Even further, perhaps some victims forgive
passively and for no reason (Nelkin 2013: 169; Arneson 2021: 287);
When reflecting on the wrong, years after the fact, they might simply
discover that their resentment is gone and they have forgiven. Russell
has argued that a forgiver can moderate her initial resentment via any
process, and that there is nothing incoherent in the idea of a
forgiveness pill (2023a: 166).</p>

<h3 id="ForJudAtt">4.3 Forgiveness, Judgments, and Attitudes</h3>

<p>
Our task is to identify the sense in which, after forgiveness, the
victim has moved on and no longer holds the wrong against the
perpetrator. We have considered the view that the forgiver now has
more positive feelings towards the wrongdoer. Either as an alternative
to this claim or in addition to it, some philosophers say that, after
forgiving, the victim <em>thinks</em> about the wrongdoer in a
different way. This might include holding new, more positive judgments
or beliefs about the wrongdoer, paying attention to different features
of the wrongdoer, or having a different quality of will towards the
wrongdoer. All of these could be described as the victim reframing the
wrongdoer or seeing the wrongdoer differently (Murphy &amp; Hampton
1988: 43).</p>

<p>
First, let us consider changes in judgment or belief. The orthodox
view is that the forgiver continues to believe that she was wronged by
the perpetrator, and that the perpetrator had no good excuse. If this
is correct, then it cannot be these judgments that change with
forgiving. Hampton claims that forgiving includes a change from
judging that the wrongdoer is &ldquo;rotten or morally indecent&rdquo;
to judging that he is a decent person with whom you could renew a
relationship (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 83; also see Govier 1999:
60). Griswold agrees, adding that the forgiver must drop any
&ldquo;presumption of decisive moral superiority&rdquo; over the
wrongdoer (2007a: 54). Hieronymi claims instead that that the forgiver
must form a new belief that the wrong no longer conveys a threatening
message and hence no longer needs to be protested by the victim
(Hieronymi 2001: 546; cf. Pereboom 2021: 89). Critics have argued that
none of these changes in judgment are an essential part of
forgiveness. According to these critics, we can forgive while still
judging that the wrongdoer is a bad person overall and should be
avoided at all costs (Hughes 1993: 337; Allais 2008: 45; Garrard and
McNaughton 2011: 99). We can forgive regardless of what we believe
about the message conveyed by the wrong action (Russell 2023a:
101).</p>

<p>
Instead of adopting more positive beliefs, perhaps the forgiver
changes her pattern of attention, choosing not to dwell on the fact
that the forgiven person is a wrongdoer, but to focus instead on the
fact that he is a rational agent who is deserving of respect and who
is capable of change (Allais 2013: 646; Ware 2014: 249). Another
possibility is that forgiveness includes a positive change in the
quality of will that forgiver bears towards the wrongdoer. We could
conceive of the victim&rsquo;s good or ill will in terms of what the
victim desires for the wrongdoer. The idea that the forgiver must bear
good will or benevolence towards the wrongdoer goes back to Butler
(1726; see also Roberts 1995: 300; Garcia 2011: 14). Several
philosophers endorse the view that the forgiver shifts from ill will
to good will, or that the forgiver wants things that are good for the
wrongdoer to happen to the wrongdoer (Downie 1965: 133; Garrard &amp;
McNaughton 2010: 23). Zaibert and Nelkin say instead that forgiveness
is compatible with bearing sustained ill will towards the person whom
you have forgiven (Zaibert 2009: 387; Nelkin 2013: 174).</p>

<h3 id="ForBeh">4.4 Forgiveness and Behaviour</h3>

<p>
The idea that forgiving consists in no longer thinking or feeling
negatively about the wrongdoer strikes some philosophers as misguided
or, at least, incomplete. To these critics, forgiveness crucially
includes treating the wrongdoer more positively than one otherwise
would have done. On this view, forgiveness is not just a matter of
internal emotions and beliefs, but of external behaviour. There is
much disagreement as to which kinds of negative behaviour are
counteracted by forgiveness (e.g. revenge, blame, punishment), and as
to how forgiveness counteracts these behaviours. Some assume that
forgiving counteracts these negative behaviours in the sense that, if
a victim continues to seek revenge (or to blame, or to punish), then
that victim has not forgiven the wrongdoer after all (Russell 2023a:
143). But others claim that forgiveness counteracts certain negative
behaviours in the sense that the forgiver merely <em>commits</em> not
to engage in those behaviours. This would allow for the possibility
that a victim has forgiven the wrongdoer but then continues to exact
revenge on him, thereby breaking her own commitment but not
undermining that fact that she has forgiven him (Warmke 2016b: 689;
Cornell 2017: 267; Bennett 2018: 229).</p>

<p>
Which kinds of negative behaviour are counteracted by forgiveness? An
extremely common claim, going back at least as far as Butler, is that
a victim who has forgiven no longer seeks to take revenge on the
perpetrator (Butler 1726; Griswold 2007a: 54; Konstan 2010: 12).
However, it is not at all clear what counts as revenge (Russell 2023a:
55). If revenge is nothing more than retributive punishment that is
imposed by the victim herself, then we might conclude that a victim
who has forgiven no longer imposes either revenge or punishment on the
wrongdoer (Zaibert 2012: 104). Yet most philosophers who claim that
forgiveness is incompatible with revenge also insist that forgiving is
compatible with continuing to punish the wrongdoer (e.g. Walker 2006:
156; Garrard and McNaughton 2011: 99; Warmke 2013: 919). We can make
sense of this combination of views if we instead take revenge to be
the essentially resentful or hostile imposition of retribution (Murphy
2003: 17), or the imposition of retribution out of personal concern
rather than out of an impartial desire to see that justice is done
(Tosi &amp; Warmke 2017: 265). This would allow that a victim who has
forgiven cannot continue to impose essentially personal or resentful
retribution, but can continue, with calm disinterest, to punish the
wrongdoer.</p>

<p>
It is also frequently claimed that forgiving is incompatible with
continuing to engage in overt blaming or shaming of the wrongdoer and
continuing to ask the wrongdoer for apology (Calhoun 1992: 84; Walker
2006: 166; Griswold 2007a: 53; Warmke 2016b: 689). These negative
behaviours, it seems, are ways in which a victim might continue to
hold the wrong against the wrongdoer, and hence are barriers to
forgiveness.</p>

<p>
While there is widespread agreement that forgiveness counteracts
revenge, blaming, and shaming, there is deep disagreement as to
whether the victim&rsquo;s having forgiven the wrongdoer for &phi; is
compatible with the victim&rsquo;s continuing to punish the wrongdoer
for having done &phi;. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> includes
&lsquo;pardon&rsquo; in its definition of &lsquo;forgive&rsquo; and it
can be argued that a victim who continues to punish the wrongdoer
continues to hold the wrong against the perpetrator has not really
moved on. Philosophers who claim that forgiveness includes the
forbearance of further punishment include Twambly (1976: 84),
Swinburne (1989: 87), Londey 1986: 4), Calhoun (1992: 84), Lang (1994:
114), Hieronymi (2001: 551), Zaibert (2009: 387), Gert (2010: 98), and
Bash (2015: 53). Russell claims that forgiving is compatible with
continued punishment, but only if that punishment is accepted by the
wrongdoer, and hence the two are no longer in conflict over the wrong
(2016: 712). If either a punishment-forbearance or a no-conflict view
of forgiveness is correct, then forgiving unrepentant wrongdoers will
sometimes be morally costly. This is because the forgiver must
withhold some kinds of punitive resistance from an unrepentant
wrongdoer, even though these kinds of resistance typically serve to
protect the victim and other members of the community against the risk
of reoffence (Russell 2023b: 253). Hence, most advocates of
punishment-forbearance accounts of forgiveness claim that, in some
circumstances, victims of wrongdoing morally should not forgive (e.g.
Richards 1988: 82; Hieronymi 2001; Zaibert 2009: 382).</p>

<p>
In contrast, many philosophers think that the victim can and sometimes
should forgive the wrongdoer while continuing to impose punishment on
him (e.g. Mabbott 1939: 158; Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 158; Holmgren
1993: 347; Hughes 1993: 337; Govier 1999: 59; Garrard &amp; McNaughton
2011: 99; Allais 2013: 650; Nelkin 2013: 184). This view is attractive
to those who believe that it is permissible or even virtuous for all
victims of wrongdoing to forgive, regardless of repentance. If
forgiving is compatible with continuing to punish the wrongdoer, then
the victim can forgive while still protecting herself and others in
the community against the risk of reoffence. Critics claim that this
account of forgiveness cannot make sense of the common claim that
forgiveness brings peace and allows victim and perpetrator to move on
and make a fresh start (Russell 2023a: 83). For further discussion of
the relationship between punishment and forgiveness, see Griswold
(2007a: 32&ndash;33), Pettigrove (2012: 117&ndash;121), Tosi and
Warmke (2017); and Warmke (2011; 2013).</p>

<p>
Another dispute concerns the relationship between forgiving and
reconciling. These concepts are distinct. Clearly, two estranged
people can reconcile via excusing or justifying the hurtful actions
that drove them apart, rather than via forgiving. However, there is
deep disagreement as to whether forgiving necessarily includes
reconciliation between victim and wrongdoer. Philosophers who assume
that forgiveness does require reconciliation include Wilson (1988:
534), Calhoun (1992: 84), Lang (1994: 114), Konstan (2010: 13). This
would limit the situations in which forgiveness is possible and would
make it impossible to forgive someone after they are dead. Strabbing
claims that forgiveness entails merely being open to reconciling, and
that a victim can be open to reconciling with the dead (2020: 541).
Most philosophers hold the opposing view, claiming that a victim can
forgive while failing to reconcile, or even refusing to reconcile with
the wrongdoer (e.g. Kolnai 1973/4: 94; Holmgren 1993: 342; Garrard and
McNaughton 2011: 98; Pettigrove 2012: 15; Zaragoza 2012: 616). This
would allow for the possibility that, after a broken romance, the two
former lovers could forgive each other but go their separate ways
rather than maintain any kind of ongoing relationship. Failure to
reconcile does not imply that the two parties remain in conflict over
the wrong, so philosophers who think that forgiveness is incompatible
with continued conflict can also claim that forgiveness does not
require reconciliation (Russell 2023a: 156).</p>

<h3 id="PerAcc">4.5 Performative Accounts</h3>

<p>
The views of forgiveness canvassed thus far have focused on
forgiveness as involving a positive change in the way that the
forgiver feels about the wrongdoer, or in the way that she thinks
about the wrongdoer, or in way the that she behaves towards the
wrongdoer after having forgiven him. But perhaps forgiveness is better
understood by focusing on what happens when the victim says &lsquo;I
forgive you&rsquo; or some cognate expression (Haber 1991: 29).
Drawing on J.L. Austin&rsquo;s theory of speech acts, some
philosophers have claimed that the victim performs a range of
illocutionary acts when uttering &lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo;. For
example, when a victim sincerely says &lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo; she
performs the <em>behabative</em> act of revealing to the wrongdoer
that she believes she was wronged, but that she has overcome her
resentment (or, at least, is in the process of doing so) (Haber 1991:
40; Pettigrove 2004a: 379; also see Austin 1962 [1975]: 160).
Pettigrove claims that in addition to functioning as a behabitive,
&lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo; can also function as a <em>commissive</em>
act; that is, it commits the speaker to forswear hostile reactive
attitudes and retaliation toward the wrongdoer and to treat her with
an appropriate level of benevolence (2004a: 385).</p>

<p>
It is possible to hold these views about the nature of the utterance
&lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo; while still believing that forgiveness
consists in a positive change in the victim&rsquo;s feeling, or
attitudes, or subsequent behaviour towards the wrongdoer, a change
that can take place independent of any such utterance, and that can
fail to have taken place despite the victim having said &lsquo;I
forgive you&rsquo;. In contrast, some philosophers have claimed that
the victim sincerely saying &lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo; to the
wrongdoer is a <em>declarative</em> speech act which makes it the case
that the victim has forgiven, even if the victim subsequently
continues to feel deeply resentful (Nelkin 2013: 172&ndash;4; Warmke
2015: 497; Cornell 2017: 263; Bennett 2018: 208). Perhaps sincerely
saying &lsquo;I forgive you&rsquo; is one way of forgiving (Norlock
2009: 97; Cornell 2017: 250), or even the central and paradigmatic way
of forgiving (Warmke 2016b: 691; Bennett 2018: 212).</p>

<p>
According to these philosophers, forgiving is closely analogous to
promising, or pardoning, or cancelling a debt (Warmke 2023: 263). Each
of these actions counts as the exercise of a normative power (Owens
2012: 4; cf. Hart 1961: 43). On this view, forgiveness is a
communicative action via which the forgiver chooses to alter the
operative norms governing the interaction between victim and wrongdoer
(Swinburne 1989: 85;&nbsp;Cornell 2017: 244; Bennett 2018: 216).
Perhaps when the victim forgives the wrongdoer she releases the
wrongdoer from the obligation to continue apologizing and making up
for it (Nelkin 2013: 177), and the forgiver creates new obligations
for herself to withhold further blame (Warmke 2016b: 690), and
possibly to withhold further punishment (Cornell 2017: 244&ndash;5).
According to Warmke, if the victim forgives the perpetrator but
subsequently continues to blame or to seek revenge, then the victim
has now wronged the perpetrator. This makes sense if, in the act of
forgiving, the wrongdoer chooses to place herself under new
obligations not to do these things (Warmke 2016a: 575).</p>

<p>
Critics have argued that forgiveness frequently does not alter norms
in these ways, and hence that forgiveness is not the exercise of a
normative power. For example, when a victim forgives a wrongdoer who
has already apologised and completely made up for it, or when she
forgives a victim who is already dead, it is not plausible that the
victim is waiving obligations owed to her by the wrongdoer (Russell
2023a: 133&ndash;140). Similarly, a normative powers view of
forgiveness struggles to make sense of the fact that forgiveness is
frequently uncommunicated, and that many victims strive unsuccessfully
to forgive despite having sincerely uttered the words &lsquo;I forgive
you&rsquo; (Govier &amp; Verwoerd 2002: 97; Ryu &amp; Sewell:
forthcoming). Advocates of a normative powers view can address some of
these objections by claiming that forgiveness requires more than just
carrying out the speech act (Scarre 2016: 936; Griswold 2007a: 53), or
by conceding that only some acts of forgiveness are norm-changing
performatives, while others might be mere changes in feelings or
attitudes (Bennett 2018: 212; Cornell 2017: 244). But if forgiveness
were sometimes a communicative action which changes norms and other
times a mere change in emotion, then very frequently it would be
unclear what follows from the fact that the victim has forgiven the
wrongdoer (Russell 2023a: 148). If the normative implications of
forgiveness are unclear, then it seems less likely that forgiveness
can play its role as a peacemaker.</p>

<h3 id="PluAcc">4.6 Pluralist Accounts</h3>

<p>
As we have seen, there is deep disagreement as to the nature of
forgiveness. Some philosophers have argued that forgiveness is just
too diverse and diffuse of a practice to be captured by a simple,
singular theory (Neblett 1974: 273). Smith observes that our
&ldquo;notions of forgiveness seem to identify a loose constellation
of interrelated meanings among various beliefs, judgments, emotions
and actions&rdquo; (2008: 134). In the face of this disagreement,
philosophers might claim that there are multiple different things that
deserve to be called forgiveness, and that we should simply
distinguish them from each other rather than try to find out which one
is the real forgiveness. This approach has been described as
conceptual pluralism (Russell 2023a: 72). For example, Adams thinks
that &ldquo;performative forgiveness&rdquo; and &ldquo;forgiveness
from the heart&rdquo; (1991: 294) are genuine but distinct things that
are both forgiveness. Similar claims have been made by Lang (1994:
108), Zaibert (2009: 385),&nbsp;Milam (2017: 62) and Norlock (2017:
xx).</p>

<p>
Another option is to offer a Wittgensteinian &lsquo;family
resemblance&rsquo; account of forgiveness that is centred on paradigm
cases, and that allows for a wide periphery of similar cases that also
count as forgiveness, but to a lesser extent (Warmke 2016b: 691).
Advocates of this approach must explain why the chosen central cases
count as being more fully forgiveness than others. Is it because they
are more morally admirable than other cases (Griswold 2007a: xvi), or
because they fit best with deliberative norms concerning forgiveness
(Warmke &amp; McKenna 2013: 200), or because they are the cases in
which forgiveness fulfills its function, or because they are more
common than the peripheral cases, or because they are most widely
recognized by ordinary people to be cases of forgiveness? A family
resemblance account which takes forgiving the dead, for example, to be
a paradigm case will differ greatly from a family resemblance account
which treats it as peripheral.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers reject conceptual pluralism and instead aim to
provide a more traditional unitary definition of forgiveness.
Advocates of narrow versions of a unitary account are required to say
that a huge number of cases that are frequently described as instances
of &lsquo;forgiveness&rsquo; do not really count as forgiveness (e.g.
Downie 1965: 129; Calhoun 1992: 77; Hieronymi 2001: 534; Zaibert 2009:
387). If we instead offer a comparatively broad but unified definition
of forgiveness, we will allow a more diverse range of phenomena to
count as forgiveness (e.g. Cornell 2017: 244). This would make room
for various kinds of forgiveness, so long as each kind falls under the
broader single definition.</p>

<h2 id="NonStaKinFor">5. Non-Standard Kinds of Forgiveness</h2>

<p>
So far, we have focused on forgiveness between a single victim and a
separate human wrongdoer. Forgiveness is also frequently described as
occurring in what we might call non-standard cases: forgiving oneself,
God&rsquo;s forgiveness of humans, and forgiveness by or of a group of
people. There is dispute as to whether these phenomena ought to be
treated as genuine instances of forgiveness.</p>

<h3 id="SelFor">5.1 Self-Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
Outside of the discipline of philosophy, talk about forgiving yourself
is almost as common as talk about forgiving others. Therapists and
celebrities routinely recommend self-forgiveness (Milam 2017: 52). At
first glance, the idea that you can forgive yourself seems no more
contentious than the claim that it is possible to blame yourself or
punish yourself. Perhaps forgiving yourself consists in first feeling
some combination of guilt and self-directed anger in light of your own
perceived wrongdoing and then removing these self-blaming attitudes
while still judging that you did wrong and had no good excuse (Milam
2017: 55). Forgiving yourself, so-conceived, would be one way of
attaining inner peace and moving on from your own wrongdoing. Despite
the widespread talk of self-forgiveness, some philosophers believe
that there is no such thing. Arendt says that &ldquo;nobody can
forgive himself&rdquo; (1958: 243), and Downie claims that when a
wrongdoer says that he has forgiven himself for wronging another, the
concept involved &ldquo;is not the concept of forgiveness at
all&rdquo; (1965: 129; cf. Swinburne 2021: 134).</p>

<p>
One reason to be sceptical about self-forgiveness is the thought that
only the victim has the standing to forgive. When you wrong someone
else by lying to them, you are not the victim, so you do not have the
standing to forgive the perpetrator (i.e. yourself) for having lied.
As we have seen in Section 3, some philosophers reject this
restriction, claiming instead that suitably related third-parties also
have the standing to forgive. But even if this is correct, we might
still think that the wrongdoer is neither the victim nor a suitably
related third-party and hence cannot forgive herself. In this case, it
would be possible for her to stop blaming herself for her own
wrongdoing, but this should not be classed as an instance of
forgiveness.</p>

<p>
There are several ways to defend the existence of self-forgiveness
against these sceptical challenges. Arguably, it is possible for me to
wrong myself, for example, by excessively sacrificing my own interests
in order to serve others or by doing something that ruins my career
(Downie 1965: 129; Hughes 1994: 557). In cases in which I wrong
myself, I am both the perpetrator and the victim, so plausibly I have
the standing to forgive myself for what I did to myself. So, it is
possible to hold a victim-only view on the standing to forgive while
also believing that self-forgiveness exists.</p>

<p>
However, many philosophers also believe that a wrongdoer can and
sometimes should forgive herself for wrongs that she did to others.
This may seem unproblematic for minor wrongs (Hughes 1994: 558), but
it opens the troubling possibility of self-indulgent perpetrators
letting themselves off the hook even for cases of extreme wrongdoing,
forgiving themselves rather than apologising and trying to make up for
the atrocities that they have committed (Kolnai 1973/4: 106). We might
simply acknowledge this possibility and then morally criticise these
self-serving self-forgivers. In contrast, some philosophers say that
self-forgiveness is possible only when certain other justifying
conditions have been met. Perhaps the wrongdoer has the ability to
forgive herself only when she has felt sufficient shame (Williston
2012: 68), or only when she has apologised, repented and fully
compensated the victim, and the victim wrongly refuses to forgive her
(Holmgren 1998: 82). Maybe she has the standing to forgive herself
when the victim is dead and hence unable to offer her well-deserved
forgiveness (Griswold 2007a: 123), or when she no longer bears ill
will towards the victim and hence is not a fitting target of
self-blame (Milam 2017: 61). Forgiving yourself might be justified
when continuing to blame yourself for your wrongdoing would be
psychologically debilitating or would undermine your self-worth (Snow
1992: 76: Holmgren 1998: 90).</p>

<h3 id="DivFor">5.2 Divine Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
The topic of God&rsquo;s relation to human wrongdoing is an important
one in mainstream Western theological and philosophical discussions of
forgiveness. Many theists believe that God forgives humans and that
forgiveness is in the nature of God (Bash 2007: 105). Theists who
believe that God forgives humans have asked questions about the nature
of God&rsquo;s forgiveness and about its degree of similarity to human
forgiveness.</p>

<p>
If divine forgiveness of humans is possible, what is its nature? One
option is to see God&rsquo;s forgiveness as including a change in
God&rsquo;s emotions. Perhaps God forgives by overcoming the
resentment that he feels towards sinners while still judging that
those sinners are culpable wrongdoers. Minas, however, claims that God
could not feel resentment because a perfect being could not have a
feeling of personal injury in response to wrongdoing (Minas 1975: 147;
cf. Warmke 2017a: 5). Perhaps instead God forgives us by first
suffering when we do wrong, then by rejoicing when we repent (Drabkin
1993: 235). However, if God is impassible (i.e., God is unable to
suffer or have reactive emotions), God&rsquo;s forgiveness could not
take this form, either (Gavrilyuk 2004).</p>

<p>
Alternatively, some theists believe that God forgives by forbearing
punishment. For example, Londey claims that forgiveness crucially
involves the remission of any penalty or sanction that a wrongdoer is
due (1986: 5; cf. Brien 1989: 35; Geuras 1992: 65). Strabbing argues
that God forgives by being open to reconciliation with humans (2017).
Swinburne suggests that God&rsquo;s forgiveness is akin to the
forgiveness of a kind of debt: when God forgives us, the guilt that
our wrongdoing incurred is wiped away (1989). Critics have claimed
that none of these theories are plausible theories of forgiveness,
because each one picks out something &ndash; mercy, reconciliation,
debt-cancellation &ndash; that is separable from forgiveness (see
Warmke 2017b).</p>

<p>
Some theists claim that we humans ought to forgive each other in
emulation of God&rsquo;s having forgiven us (cf. Downie 1965, 134).
However, if God is very different to humans, then it might be
misguided or dangerous for humans to model their behaviour on that of
a forgiving God (Tombs 2008: 592). For example, perhaps it is
dangerous for us to forgive unrepentant wrongdoers, but not dangerous
for God to do so. Similarly, if the shared sinful nature of humans
gives us a reason to forgive one another, then God&rsquo;s forgiveness
of humans would not be justified in the same way as human forgiveness
of other humans (Williams 2008: 584&ndash;585). (See also Brien 1989;
Scheiber 2001; Bash 2015.)</p>

<h3 id="GroForPolFor">5.3 Group Forgiveness and Political Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
Many cases of forgiveness occur in political contexts but nonetheless
feature individual human wrongdoers and an individual human victim.
The political setting &ndash; including considerations involving
ongoing conflict and oppression &ndash; may change the nature of the
wrongdoing and may provide extra reasons for or against forgiving
(Bell 2009: 168; MacLachlan 2009: 192; Garrard and McNaughton 2010: 1;
Cherry 2023: 89; Bell 2023: 337). Nonetheless, there is no great
difficulty in fitting these cases into a standard account of
interpersonal forgiveness. However, the language of forgiveness is
sometimes used in political contexts in which either the forgiver or
the wrongdoer is a group of people rather than an individual person.
For example, we might ask whether the American people could forgive
former President Clinton for lying to a grand jury, whether Indigenous
Australians as a group could forgive those who invaded and colonised
Australia, or whether victims of child sexual abuse by Catholic
priests could forgive the Church. According to a deflationary reading,
all that we are asking is whether, say, a high proportion of
individual Americans could forgive Clinton (cf. Pettigrove 2006: 491).
In contrast, some philosophers claim that groups can forgive and can
be forgiven <em>as groups</em> (Govier 2002: 86; Radzik 2009: 181;
Stockdale 2023: 394).</p>

<p>
As we have seen, there is great disagreement as to which key
properties must be possessed by the forgiver in a normal interpersonal
case of forgiveness. Some say forgivers must be able to feel emotions
such as resentment, to revise beliefs in light of reasons, and to make
commitments to act in certain ways. When we ask whether group
forgiveness is possible, there are additional disagreements over the
following claims:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>Group forgiveness is possible only if a group can possess the same
key properties as individuals who forgive and are forgiven</li>

<li>Groups can in fact possess the requisite properties that are
required for forgiving or being forgiven (whichever those properties
happen to be)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Griswold endorses (1) and rejects (2). He maintains that normal
interpersonal forgiveness can occur only when the victim feels
negative reactive attitudes including resentment and then removes
those negative emotions in response to the wrongdoer&rsquo;s remorse
and apology (2007a: 41, 52). Since a group of people cannot feel an
emotion such as resentment as a group, Griswold argues, groups are not
the kind of thing that can forgive (2007a: 142). Nonetheless, Griswold
claims, groups sometimes do engage in a related but distinct process
which he calls political apology and reconciliation. Notable examples
include the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa (Tutu
1999; Griswold 2007a: 136; Allais 2008: 40; Cherry 2023: 65) and the
German Chancellor&rsquo;s 1951 apology on behalf of Germany to the
Jewish people for Nazi war crimes. (See also Brooks 2004; Biggar
2008).</p>

<p>
Some philosophers think that the process described by Griswold as
&lsquo;political apology and reconciliation&rsquo; actually is a
species of forgiveness. We could argue for this conclusion by
endorsing both (1) and (2); that is, claiming that at least some
groups do possess the same key properties as individuals who are
capable of forgiving, and hence that these groups also can forgive.
Perhaps a suitably structured group of humans &ndash; a corporation, a
government, a committee &ndash; can be an agent, and hence hold
beliefs and make decisions and commitments as a group (Govier 2002:
86; List &amp; Pettit 2011: 39; Smith 2021: 156). If so, then a
suitably structured group which has been wronged can assess evidence
of remorse and repentance in the wrongdoer and can then resolve to
withhold further blame and punishment and to reconcile (Radzik 2009:
186). If this is all that is required for forgiveness, then this group
can forgive as a group. If forgiveness necessarily includes changes in
emotions, advocates of this approach would also have to claim that a
group can feel an emotion as a group (Govier 2002: 91; Pettigrove
2006: 493; cf. Stockdale 2023: 398). Even if we accept this
possibility for suitably structured groups, we might conclude that
many loosely configured groups &ndash; including, say the American
people, or Indigenous Australians &ndash; lack the coordinated
structure required to count as an agent, and hence are not the kind of
thing that can forgive (cf. List &amp; Pettit 2011: 40).</p>

<p>
We could take an alternative path to the conclusion that group
forgiveness is possible by denying (1) and endorsing (2). For example,
we could claim that ordinary interpersonal forgiveness requires a
change in emotions in the forgiver, but that forgiveness by political
groups is much more similar to mercy, pardon, or the waiving of a
moral debt, all of which can occur completely independent of emotions
(Digeser 2001: 29; cf. MacLachlan 2012: 37; Stockdale 2023: 402). Yet
if forgiveness by individuals is systematically and radically
different to forgiveness by groups, it will be tempting to conclude
that so-called group forgiveness, along with the so-called the
forgiveness of financial debts, is better treated as a separate
phenomenon, governed by different norms and playing a different role
in our lives (cf. Tosi &amp; Warmke 2017: 212).</p>

<h2 id="EthFor">6. The Ethics of Forgiveness</h2>

<h3 id="MorDisAboFor">6.1 Moral Disagreements about Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
Forgiveness is praised by the major world religions and frequently
encouraged in the secular tradition of therapeutic psychology and the
self-help movement. Some Christians believe that we have been
commanded to forgive all who wrong us. Nonetheless, there is
persistent disagreement as to when and why a victim ought to forgive,
and as to whether forgiveness is virtuous. We will consider these
issues in turn.</p>

<p>
First, though, it is important to note that some of these moral
disagreements rest on deeper disputes as to the proper definition of
forgiveness. For example, imagine that two philosophers agree that a
specific victim is morally permitted to abandon her resentment, but
morally ought to continue to impose punishment on the unrepentant
wrongdoer. Suppose that one of these philosophers thinks that
forgiving necessarily includes the withholding of further punishment
(e.g. Zaibert 2009: 387) whereas the other takes forgiveness to be
compatible with the imposition of further punishment (e.g. Garrard
2002: 153). These two philosophers will disagree as to whether it is
morally permissible for this victim to forgive this wrongdoer, yet,
given their different conceptions of forgiveness, it seems that both
are actually recommending the same course of action to the victim. In
order to distinguish substantive moral disagreements from merely
linguistic disagreements, we must pay close attention to the specific
conceptions of forgiveness that are being employed by those who are
making moral claims about whether a victim should or should not
forgive (Russell 2023a: 70).</p>

<h3 id="CriFor">6.2 Criticism of Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
A few philosophers have claimed that forgiveness is always morally
wrong or always morally inferior to alternative options. A
perfectionist might hold that whatever attitudes or actions we
overcome or forbear in forgiveness were not morally good in the first
place. Perhaps to feel resentment in the face of wrongdoing is to show
moral weakness, or maybe resentment is a deplorably vindictive,
transactional, and self-righteous response to having been wronged
(Nussbaum 2016: 5). If either of these claims were correct, then the
best thing that a victim could do is not to resent and forgive, but to
rise above it and not feel resentment in the first place. Griswold
argues that something like this perfectionist scheme can be found in
the ancients from Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Epicureans
(2007a: 2&ndash;14). And though his views on what we now call
forgiveness are complicated, Nietzsche might be understood as
&ldquo;seeing forgiveness as part of a moral system that must be
rejected <em>in toto</em>&rdquo; (Griswold 2007a: 15; cf. Blustein
2014: 23&ndash;30).</p>

<p>
There are several ways to argue against the view that forgiveness is
always morally flawed. We might accept that resentment is always
immoral, but assert that instant forgiveness is possible, and that the
ideally forgiving person forgives without getting angry in the first
place (Pettigrove 2012: 3). A more common response, though, is to
claim that resentment is often both morally fitting and useful, and
that often a victim ought to first feel resentment and engage in
blaming behaviour, then move past it to forgiveness (Hieronymi 2001:
530).</p>

<p>
Another critique of forgiveness is put forward by philosophers who are
sceptical of moral responsibility and blameworthiness (e.g. Pereboom
2014). Arguably, the victim who forgives necessarily still judges that
she was wronged and that the perpetrator is culpable. If no one is
ever culpable, then every act of forgiveness would include a mistaken
moral judgment. The responsibility sceptic might concede that
forgiving is morally better than blaming and punishing, but would
still say that forgiveness is essentially flawed.</p>

<p>
Kekes maintains that forgiveness is never justified (2009: 501, cf.
Kolnai 1973/4). He thinks that forgiveness is possible only if the
wrongdoer is blameworthy, but so long as the wrongdoer is blameworthy,
the victim has reason to blame rather than forgive. Defenders of
forgiveness might concede that a forgiver must judge that the
wrongdoer is blameworthy, but insist that this means merely that the
wrongdoer had no good excuse and is answerable for what he did. The
forgiver need not judge that the wrongdoer ought to be blamed and
censured forever, even if he changes his ways or makes up for what he
did (Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 24; Hieronymi 2001: 545). Some
philosophers argue that blameworthiness may provide reasons that
merely <em>justify</em> blame without requiring blame, and that
forgiveness is <em>also</em> justified by the blameworthy wrongdoing
(Allais 2008: 61; Warmke &amp; McKenna 2013: 206; Pettigrove 2021:
74).</p>

<h3 id="StrEndFor">6.3 Strong Endorsement of Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
It is more common for people to take a morally positive view of
forgiveness. Some go so far as to endorse unconditional forgiveness.
They say that forgiveness is morally good, no matter what. However,
the meaning of this claim is far from transparent. One point of
clarification concerns the kind of positive moral quality that is
ascribed to forgiveness. For example, forgiving might be said to be
obligatory, or right, or good, or supererogatory, or virtuous, or
praiseworthy, or merely permissible (Gamlund 2010: 541; Garcia 2011:
17). Some have claimed that forgiveness has the unusual moral property
of being &lsquo;elective&rsquo; or gift-like, meaning that it is never
obligatory for a victim to forgive, and always permissible for a
victim to forgive (Calhoun 1992: 79; Allais 2013: 644; Fricker 2022:
45; for the contrary view see Griswold 2007a: 63; Milam 2018: 574;
Russell 2023a: 106).</p>

<p>
In addition to the question of which positive moral property is
universally possessed by forgiveness, we must distinguish between the
following two kinds of universality claim (Russell 2023a: 76):</p>

<ol type="1">

<li><em>Universal positive evaluation</em>: every instance of
forgiving has the relevant positive moral quality (e.g. is good, or is
right, or is virtuous)</li>

<li><em>Universal recommendation</em>: every victim of culpable
wrongdoing morally ought to forgive those who wronged them (or, it
would be virtuous or praiseworthy for every victim of wrongdoing to
forgive)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let us say that someone who asserts one or both of these claims is
strongly endorsing forgiveness. The most wholehearted supporters of
forgiveness would claim that every instance of forgiveness is morally
good, <em>and</em> that every victim of wrongdoing ought to forgive.
For example, they might believe that God has commanded us to forgive
all who wrong us, and that God approves of every act of
forgiveness.</p>

<p>
It is more common for philosophers to endorse one of these two
universality claims while rejecting the other. Let us consider
<em>universal positive evaluation</em>; that is, the claim that every
instance of forgiveness is morally good. Philosophers who hold this
view typically think that goodness or virtuousness is an essential
part of the content of the concept of forgiveness, and that any
similar act or process that is not morally good would thereby count as
condonation rather than forgiveness (Kolnai 1973/4: 96; Hieronymi
2001: 530&ndash;531; Griswold 2007a: 51; cf. Swinburne 2021: 138).
Most of these philosophers reject <em>universal recommendation</em>.
They think that every act of forgiveness is good, but that forgiveness
is possible only when certain contingent conditions have been met by
the victim and the wrongdoer. For example, they might claim that, by
definition, forgiveness is done for morally good reasons and with a
proper appreciation of the nature and scale of the wrongdoing
(Griswold 2007b: 276). If they also believe that forgiveness
necessarily includes the removal of punishment or conflict, they might
say that forgiveness can occur only when the wrongdoer is apologetic
and repentant (Lang 1994: 106; Griswold 2007a: 52), or only when the
wrong action no longer makes a threatening claim (Hieronymi 2001:
548). These philosophers think that forgiveness is morally good
whenever it occurs, so in some sense they believe that forgiveness is
unconditionally good. But clearly these philosophers are not
recommending that every victim should forgive, regardless of apology
and repentance. Rather, they think that a victim who is confronted by
a dangerous unrepentant wrongdoer <em>cannot</em> forgive.</p>

<p>
In contrast, some philosophers endorse <em>universal
recommendation</em> while rejecting <em>universal positive
evaluation</em>. They agree with Garcia&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;we
are morally obligated to forgive all wrongdoers&rdquo; (2011: 17) or
Downie&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;it is always good to forgive&rdquo;
(1965: 134) or, at least, that it is morally permissible for every
victim of wrongdoing to forgive (Calhoun 1992: 79; Garrard &amp;
McNaughton 2011: 104; Pettigrove 2012: 100; Allais 2013: 644). This
implies that forgiveness is permissible regardless of whether the
wrongdoer has repented and apologised, but it does not imply that
every act of forgiveness is done well or done for the right reasons
(Pettigrove 2012: 115). Advocates of this view might claim that some
victims forgive for selfish reasons or without having appreciated the
significance of the wrong done to them, and hence that their acts of
forgiveness are far from virtuous and may even count as facile or
deplorable (Garrard &amp; McNaughton 2011: 105; Pettigrove 2023: 364).
Arguably, victims who forgive in these flawed ways are failing to
embody self-respect (Holmgren 1993: 341). However, if <em>universal
recommendation</em> is true, then there must have been a morally good
reason for forgiving that was available to every one of these facile
forgivers, a reason that they failed to act upon.</p>

<p>
Several such universally present reasons have been posited by
philosophers. Perhaps the fact that the wrongdoer is our fellow human
being gives us sufficient reason to forgive him (Garrard 2002: 164).
Alternatively, perhaps the reason is provided by the fact that the
wrongdoer is a rational agent who is capable of reform (Govier 1999:
70). If forgiveness is always a generous gift that is beneficial to
the wrongdoer, this could count as an ever-present reason to forgive
(Allais 2013: 648). Maybe the fact that the victim herself is also a
wrongdoer on other occasions gives that victim a good reason to
forgive those who have wronged her (Lang 1994: 115; Roberts 1995:
298). In one sense, these philosophers endorse unconditional
forgiveness; they think that a morally good act of forgiveness is
available to every victim regardless of whether the wrongdoer
apologises and repents. Yet they also believe that some acts of
forgiveness are morally flawed and blameworthy. Thus, there is also a
sense of the phrase &lsquo;unconditional forgiveness&rsquo; according
to which these philosophers do not endorse unconditional
forgiveness.</p>

<h3 id="CauEndFor">6.4 Cautious Endorsement of Forgiveness</h3>

<p>
So far, we have considered two strongly opposed normative views: the
view that forgiveness is always morally flawed or wrong, and the view
that forgiveness is always morally good or always called for. Many
philosophers position themselves between these extremes, claiming that
in some cases of wrongdoing it is morally good for victims to forgive
and often victims forgive for good reasons, but other times victims
forgive in situations where it would be wrong for any victim to do so
(Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 32; Milam 2018: 583). People who occupy
this middle ground uphold a cautious and conditional ideal in relation
to forgiveness. They point to several kinds of <em>pro tanto</em>
reason that count in favour of forgiving and several kinds that count
against forgiving. In certain contexts, the balance of reasons
decisively favour forgiving, but when the details of the situation are
different, the balance of reasons might call for the victim not to
forgive (Roberts 1995: 293; Russell 2019: 283). (The reasons that
count against forgiving are reasons for the victim to continue to do
something that is incompatible with forgiving: perhaps reasons to
continue to resent, or to blame, or to enforce punishment, or to
refuse to reconcile.)</p>

<p>
Some philosophers have claimed that the extremity of the initial
wrongdoing impacts on the permissibility of forgiveness, independent
of any subsequent repentance or apology by the perpetrator. Perhaps
there are atrocities or evil actions that are so wrong that they are
unforgiveable come what may (Russell 2018: 222) or maybe forgiveness
of even the worst evildoing can be justified (Govier 1999: 71). It is
commonly believed that it is permissible to forgive minor wrongs
without waiting for repentance or apology.</p>

<p>
The fact that the wrongdoer has acknowledged the wrongdoing, repented,
apologised, and compensated the victim is typically counted as a
reason in favour of forgiving (Allais 2008: 37). Some claim that
forgiving can still be justified in the absence of these things, say,
as a generous gift or as a beneficial peace-making move (Pettigrove
2012: 138). Others maintain that forgiving can be justified only if
the wrongdoer has had a change of heart (Milam 2019: 247). This
intuition could be grounded in an appeal to the victim&rsquo;s
self-respect (Haber 1991: 90; Novitz 1998: 299; Griswold 2007a:
64&ndash;5) or in the requirement to take morality seriously (Murphy
&amp; Hampton 1988: 24). Alternatively, it could be grounded in an
appeal to retributive justice or considerations of what the wrongdoer
owes to the victim. Perhaps the wrongdoer must <em>earn</em>
forgiveness by doing these things and can deserve to be forgiven only
by discharging his reparative obligations (Griswold 2007a: 69). Some
think that, if a wrongdoer has done all of these things, then the
victim is now morally obligated to forgive (Hieronymi 2001: 552;
Griswold 2007a: 67). Others say that these reparative actions count as
reason to forgive but never make it obligatory for victims to forgive.
In support of this, they claim that it is never appropriate for an
apologetic wrongdoer to demand to be forgiven (Allais 2013: 642; cf.
Griswold 2007a: 68). Another justice-related reason that might favour
forgiving is the fact that the wrongdoer has been punished, either by
the state, the community or by the victim herself (Russell 2024: 48).
According to Murphy, the fact that the wrongdoer has already suffered
enough is a reason that favours forgiving (Murphy 2003: 51; cf.
Hallich 2013: 1006).</p>

<p>
The consequences that flow from choosing to forgive or not to forgive
might also provide reasons for or against forgiving. If forgiving
increases the happiness of the victim by allowing her to shed the
burden of resentment and resistance or by removing the victim from
dangerous conflict with the wrongdoer, this would count as a
prudential reason to forgive (Arneson 2021: 291). Some philosophers
say that these considerations carry no moral weight in relation to the
morality of forgiveness (Hallich 2013: 1008), but others take them to
be morally relevant, if not decisive. Similarly, if being forgiven
raises the wellbeing of the wrongdoer, this might count as a pro tanto
reason for the victim to forgive (Pettigrove 2012: 139). In the same
vein, so-called proleptic forgiveness is given to an unrepentant
wrongdoer in the hope of inducing him to repent and reform (Kolnai
1973/4: 102; Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 30; Griswold 2007a: 121) and
might be justified if it actually succeeds in this aim (Russell 2019:
279). Forgiveness is often touted as a beneficial peace-making move in
situations of entrenched conflict (Pettigrove 2012: 139; Arneson 2021:
293), allowing cooperation to be reestablished and to persist (Ingram
2013: 1078).</p>

<p>
However, all of these appeals to the good consequences of forgiving
must be weighed up against any bad consequences. The question of
which, if any, bad outcomes are produced by forgiveness depends not
only on the context of any given case, but also on which behaviours
are assumed to be incompatible with forgiveness. As we have seen, some
philosophers believe that a forgiver must subsequently withhold
further blame and punishment (Hieronymi 2001: 551) or must remove
herself from conflict with the perpetrator (Russell 2016: 712). Others
say that the forgiver must reconcile with the wrongdoer (Wilson 1988:
534). When the wrongdoer is repentant and reformed, it will usually
not be dangerous to do these things. However, when the wrongdoer is an
unrepentant repeat offender, making peace and reconciling are likely
to put both the victim and other members of the community at greater
risk. On this view, forgiving is sometimes morally wrong because in
some cases forgiving facilitates reoffence (Russell 2023a: 86; cf.
Pettigrove 2012: 122). This points to another reason why apology and
repentance count in favour of forgiving: they provide some evidence
that the wrongdoer no longer poses a serious risk of reoffence, and
hence that it is safe for the victim to forgive and cease resisting
the wrongdoer. Philosophers who uphold a cautious and conditional
ideal in relation to forgiveness think that forgiveness is sometimes
deserved and sometimes beneficial, but sometimes so dangerous as to be
morally wrong.</p>

<h3 id="ForVir">6.5 Forgiveness and Virtue</h3>

<p>
We have seen that at least some individual acts of forgiveness can be
judged to be virtuous in the sense of being morally right,
well-motivated, and embodying ethical excellence. Some philosophers
have suggested that people who forgive well thereby manifest a single
virtue, such as justice, or mercy, or love (Pettigrove 2023:
366&ndash;73; cf. Lippitt 2020: 88). However, evaluations of acts of
forgiveness often include appeals to a variety of specific virtues and
vices. Forgiveness of an unapologetic wrongdoer could manifest the
virtues of generosity, love, and compassion, although some such acts
of forgiveness might be accused of expressing the vices of injustice
and recklessness. Forgiveness of a repentant and apologetic wrongdoer
could manifest the virtues of justice and self-respect. Similarly,
someone who refuses to forgive a repentant wrongdoer might be
criticised for manifesting the vices of vindictiveness or
self-righteousness.</p>

<p>
Rather than merely evaluating acts of forgiveness in terms of other
virtues, many philosophers claim that there is a specific moral virtue
that is called forgiveness (Downie 1965: 128&ndash;9; Kolnai 1973/4:
104; Holmgren 1993: 350; Griswold 2007a: 113; Warmke 2015: 503).
Roberts calls this virtue &ldquo;forgivingness&rdquo; (1995: 289).
Arguably, this is not equivalent to Aristotle&rsquo;s virtue of
mildness (1125b31&ndash;2; see Griswold 2007a, 4&ndash;5) or to Stoic
invulnerability (Griswold 2007b: 283) or to the Christian virtue of
charity, all of which have much wider scope than anything that could
plausibly be called the virtue of forgiveness. Not all proper
management of anger counts as forgiveness and not all generosity or
beneficence counts as forgiveness.</p>

<p>
If there is a virtue of forgiveness, there is deep disagreement as to
its nature. Some of these disagreements map onto previously discussed
disputes as to which individual acts of forgiveness are morally right
and well-motivated. For example, one possible virtue of forgiveness
would be the stable character trait of not even getting angry in
response to having been wronged, but responding unconditionally with
generous goodwill in a way that manifests self-respect (cf. Pettigrove
2012, 3). According to this view, the person who has the virtue of
forgiveness forgives all who wrong her and does so for a good
reason.</p>

<p>
Others claim that the virtue of forgiveness consists in a character
trait that disposes its bearer to respond to being wronged by first
resenting and blaming and by removing these negative reactions when
and only when the right reasons fall into place, say, when the
wrongdoer has apologised and repented (Griswold 2007a: xv; cf. Roberts
1995: 293). It is easy to position this purported virtue of
forgiveness between an associated vice of deficiency (i.e. not
forgiving enough, being vindictive) and an associated vice of excess
(forgiving too readily, or condoning wrongs that ought to be resented
and resisted). However, advocates of this view must claim that
sometimes a victim manifests the virtue of forgiveness by refusing to
forgive, a claim which may create confusion. Russell proposes that we
avoid this confusion by abandoning the idea that there is a virtue of
forgiveness. He suggests instead that the relevant virtue in this
domain is that of responding well to having been wronged, a virtue
that sometimes manifests in forgiveness, but in other cases manifests
in a justified refusal to forgive (Russell 2023a: 175).</p>
