<h1>Analysis</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Apr 7, 2003; substantive revision Thu Jul 18, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Analysis has always been at the heart of philosophical method, but it
has been understood and practised in many different ways. Perhaps, in
its broadest sense, it might be defined as a process of identifying or
working back to what is more fundamental by means of which something,
initially taken as given, can be derived, explained or reconstructed.
The derivation, explanation or reconstruction is sometimes conceived
as the corresponding process of synthesis, but it is more often
counted as part of the analytic project as a whole. This allows great
variation in specific method, however. The aim may be to get back to
basics and elucidate connections, but there may be all sorts of ways
of doing this, each of which might be called &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;.
The dominance of &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; philosophy in the
English-speaking world, and its growing influence in the rest of the
world, might suggest that a consensus has formed concerning the role
and importance of analysis. But this assumes that there is agreement
on what &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; means, and this is far from clear.
Throughout the history of philosophy there have also been powerful
criticisms of analysis, but these have always been to specific forms
of analysis, which has only encouraged the development of newer forms.
If we look at the history of philosophy, and even at just the history
of (recent Western) analytic philosophy, we find a rich and extensive
repertoire of conceptions and techniques of analysis which
philosophers have continually drawn upon and modified in different
ways. Analytic philosophy is thriving precisely because of the range
of conceptions and techniques of analysis that it involves. It may
have fragmented into various interlocking subtraditions and,
increasingly, is now being &lsquo;backdated&rsquo; and widened in
scope to include earlier and contemporaneous traditions, but those
subtraditions and related traditions are held together by their shared
history and methodological interconnections. There are also forms of
analysis in traditions clearly distinct from Western analytic
philosophy, and these also need to be recognized and brought into
debates about analytic methodologies, to open up new approaches and
perspectives. It is the aim of this article to indicate something of
the range of conceptions of analysis in the history of philosophy and
their interconnections, as well as their role in understanding the
history of philosophy itself, and to provide a bibliographical
resource for those wishing to explore analytic methodologies and the
philosophical issues they raise.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="GeneIntr">1. General Introduction</h2>

<p>
The word &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; derives from the ancient Greek term
&lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo;. The prefix &lsquo;<em>ana</em>&rsquo;
means &lsquo;up&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>lusis</em>&rsquo; (from the verb
&lsquo;<em>luein</em>&rsquo;) means &lsquo;loosening&rsquo;,
&lsquo;separating&rsquo;, or &lsquo;release&rsquo;, so that
&lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo; means &lsquo;loosening up&rsquo;,
&lsquo;breaking up&rsquo;, or &lsquo;dissolution&rsquo;. One of its
earliest recorded uses occurs in Homer&rsquo;s <em>Odyssey</em>, where
Penelope is described as &lsquo;analysing&rsquo;&mdash;i.e.,
&lsquo;unravelling&rsquo;&mdash;by night the shroud she was weaving by
day, to stave off her suitors, having promised to decide who to marry
(in Odysseus&rsquo; long absence) when the shroud was finished. The
term was then extended, metaphorically, in talking of
&lsquo;unravelling&rsquo; or &lsquo;dissolving&rsquo; problems (Beaney
2017, pp. 94&ndash;5, where the brilliance of Penelope&rsquo;s
solution to her own problem is noted!). Philosophical and
methodological terms often have their roots in metaphorical uses of
everyday terms, and this talk of &lsquo;unravelling&rsquo; and related
talk of weaving and unweaving a web may perhaps be the most important
of all. They are metaphors that are widely used in many cultures,
making a cross-cultural investigation especially appropriate and
fruitful.</p>

<p>
We can use the metaphor in introducing the account offered here. Over
the course of the history of philosophy, a complex web of conceptions
and practices of analysis has been woven, and our aim is to unravel
selected parts of this to give some sense of its nature and structure.
The idea of &lsquo;unravelling&rsquo; itself provides an initial
thread to find our way through this web, but this thread is interwoven
with many other threads, and the term &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;, too, is
only one of a web of terms used in conceptualizing and practising
analysis. (In this substantially revised and expanded version of the
entry on &lsquo;Analysis&rsquo;, we will be considering examples from
various &lsquo;non-Western&rsquo; traditions, to give a more rounded
picture of the world-wide web of analysis, but here we will have to be
even more selective to maintain perspicuity.)</p>

<h3 id="CharAnal">1.1 Characterizations of Analysis</h3>

<p>
If asked what &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; means, most people today
immediately think of breaking something down into its components; and
this is how analysis tends to be officially characterized. In the
<em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em>, for example,
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; is defined as the &ldquo;resolution into
simpler elements by analysing (opp. <em>synthesis</em>)&rdquo;, the
only other uses mentioned being the mathematical and the psychological
 [<a href="s1.html#COD">Quotation</a>].
 And in the <em>Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</em>,
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; is defined as &ldquo;the process of breaking a
concept down into more simple parts, so that its logical structure is
displayed&rdquo;
 [<a href="s1.html#ODP">Quotation</a>].
 The restriction to concepts and the reference to displaying
&lsquo;logical structure&rsquo; are important qualifications, but the
core conception remains that of breaking something down.</p>

<p>
This conception may be called the <em>decompositional</em> conception
of analysis. This is clearly connected to the idea of unravelling. We
may need to take something apart to understand how it is composed or
works, and we can see how an analytic project may have a
decompositional&ndash;compositional structure. We need to identify the
key elements that enable us to explain how something is put together
or works.</p>

<p>
This is not the only conception, however, and is arguably neither the
dominant conception in the pre-modern period nor the conception that
is characteristic of at least one major strand in
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo; philosophy. In ancient Greek thought,
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; referred primarily to the process of working
back to first principles by means of which something could then be
demonstrated. This conception may be called the <em>regressive</em>
conception of analysis (see
 <a href="#AnciConcAnal">Section 2</a>).
 Since the aim is to see how something is then derived or explained,
the complementary process&mdash;&lsquo;synthesis&rsquo; or
&lsquo;progression&rsquo;, as we might call it&mdash;is also involved
in the analytic project as a whole. Indeed, following through the
implications of something may be one way to identify the more basic
propositions or principles (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#2">Ancient Greek Geometry</a>).
 So analysis here may have a regressive&ndash;progressive
structure.</p>

<p>
In the work of Frege and Russell, on the other hand, before the
processes of decomposition and/or regression could take place, the
statements to be analysed had first to be translated into their
&lsquo;correct&rsquo; logical form (see
 <a href="#ConcAnalAnalPhil">Section 6</a>).
 This suggests that analysis also involves an <em>interpretive</em> or
<em>transformative</em> dimension. This too, however, has its roots in
earlier thought (see especially the supplementary sections on
 <a href="s2.html#2">Ancient Greek Geometry</a>
 and
 <a href="s3.html#5">Medieval European Philosophy</a>),
 and is exemplified in an even more striking form in Indian analytic
philosophy (see the supplementary sections on
 <a href="s3.html#2">Medieval Indian Philosophy</a>
 and
 <a href="s4.html#6">Indian Analytic Philosophy</a>).
 Once again, there is a bidirectional process involved, translating
into and out of the privileged conceptual or logical framework, so
that analysis may also have an interpretive&ndash;reinterpretive
structure.</p>

<p>
These three conceptions should not be seen as competing. In actual
practices of analysis, which are invariably richer than the accounts
that are offered of them, all three conceptions are typically
reflected, though to differing degrees and in differing forms. To
analyse something, we may first have to interpret it in some way,
translating an initial statement, say, into the privileged language of
logic, linguistic theory, mathematics, or science, before articulating
the relevant elements and structures, and all in the service of
identifying fundamental principles by means of which to explain it.
The complexities that this schematic description suggests can only be
appreciated by considering particular examples of analysis.</p>

<p>
There is a fourth conception, however, which fits comfortably into a
holistic worldview rather than the atomistic worldview associated with
the decompositional conception. This involves a movement not from what
is initially given to its parts, but from what is initially given to
the wider whole. This can be called the <em>connective</em>
conception. The idea here is that something can only be properly
understood in its connective relations to appropriate things in the
wider context or whole. It might be regarded as an
<em>elucidatory</em> rather than <em>explanatory</em> conception, and
in the period of ordinary language philosophy in twentieth-century
analytic philosophy, in reacting to the earlier phase of logical
atomism, was contrasted with the reductive or decompositional
conception (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s6.html#8">Oxford Linguistic Philosophy</a>).
 Connective analysis may also be seen as capturing the
<em>complementarity</em> involved in the other conceptions. For in
seeing something as connected to other things in a larger whole, one
may also be seeing that whole as decomposable into parts, or a system
of thought as generated from certain axioms, or a set of claims as
interpretable within a more technical language. So connective analysis
itself connects the decompositional&ndash;compositional,
regressive&ndash;progressive and interpretive&ndash;reinterpretive
structures that analytic projects as a whole typically have.</p>

<p>
These four conceptions, then, should be seen as <em>aspects</em> of
analytic projects that are themselves to be understood as wholes.
Analysis can itself be analysed, and in what follows, we do so by
going back into the history of philosophy, identifying particular
examples and accepted models to illustrate the range of forms of
analysis, and interpreting and connecting them to provide as rich an
account as we can (in the space of this entry) of analytic methodology
in philosophy.</p>

<p>
Philosophical analysis, of course, is only one <em>type</em> of
analysis, and there are indefinitely many other types, such as
geometrical analysis, linguistic analysis, logical analysis,
mathematical analysis, hermeneutic analysis, psychological analysis,
psychoanalysis, phenomenological analysis, political analysis,
economic analysis, feminist analysis, and so on. This is hardly
surprising, for in every science or field of thinking, analytic
techniques are employed, and the analysis can be qualified in the
respective way. Philosophical analysis has its own forms, but they
interconnect with&mdash;and are inspired by&mdash;related types of
analysis such as geometrical analysis, logical analysis, linguistic
analysis, conceptual analysis, psychological analysis, mathematical
analysis, and so on. The intricate web of analysis does indeed reach
through the whole world of conceptual thought.</p>

<h3 id="TermForAnal">1.2 Terms for Analysis</h3>

<p>
Understanding conceptions of analysis is not simply a matter of
attending to the use of the word &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; and its
cognates&mdash;or obvious equivalents in languages other than English,
such as &lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo; in Greek or
&lsquo;<em>Analyse</em>&rsquo; in German. Socratic definition is
arguably a form of conceptual analysis, yet the term
&lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo; does not occur anywhere in
Plato&rsquo;s dialogues (see
 <a href="#AnciConcAnal">Section 2</a>
 below). Nor, indeed, do we find it in Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em>, which is the classic text for understanding ancient
Greek geometry: Euclid presupposed what came to be known as the method
of analysis in presenting his proofs &lsquo;synthetically&rsquo;. In
Latin, &lsquo;<em>resolutio</em>&rsquo; was used to render the Greek
word &lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo; in its methodological use (with
&lsquo;<em>decompositio</em>&rsquo; also used in other contexts), and
although &lsquo;resolution&rsquo; has a different range of meanings,
it is often used synonymously with &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s3.html#6">European Renaissance Philosophy</a>).
 In Aristotelian syllogistic theory, and especially from the time of
Descartes, forms of analysis have also involved
&lsquo;reduction&rsquo;; and in early analytic philosophy it was
&lsquo;reduction&rsquo; that was seen as the goal of philosophical
analysis (see especially the supplementary section on
 <a href="s6.html#6">The Cambridge School of Analysis</a>).</p>
 
<p>
When it comes to considering philosophical traditions outside the
Western canon, we need to be open-minded about the prospects of
methodologies being &lsquo;analytic&rsquo;, or at least analogous to
analytic methodologies, even if rather different terms are used or
they are conceived or practised in rather different ways. In an early
text of ancient Indian philosophy, for example, scholarly debate is
described as an &lsquo;unravelling&rsquo;
(&lsquo;<em>nibbe&#7789;hanam</em>&rsquo;), invoking just that basic
metaphor we have seen in the case of &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#6">Ancient Indian Philosophy</a>.)
 And even if the differences outweigh the similarities, this in itself
may shed light on what &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; means, by way of
contrast (see, for example, the supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#5">Ancient Chinese Philosophy</a>).
 One sign of just how extensively analytic methodologies can be found
across the range of philosophical traditions is the ease with which
later commentators, especially in the modern period, describe them as
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo;. It is not anachronistic, as there are often
strong grounds for doing so. Talk of &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; has
evolved dramatically across the centuries and the interwoven threads
of continuity are not only natural but enrich our thinking and deepen
our sense of a common humanity and rationality.</p>

<h2 id="AnciConcAnal">2. Ancient Conceptions of Analysis</h2>

<p>
As noted above, the word &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; derives from the
ancient Greek term &lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo;, which originally
meant &lsquo;loosening up&rsquo; or &lsquo;dissolution&rsquo; and was
then readily extended to the solving or dissolving of a problem. It
was in this sense that it was employed in ancient Greek geometry and
the method of analysis that was developed influenced both Plato and
Aristotle. Also important, however, was the influence of
Socrates&rsquo;s concern with definition, in which the roots of modern
conceptual analysis can be found. What we already have in ancient
Greek thought, then, is a complex web of methodologies, of which the
most important are Socratic definition, which Plato elaborated into
his method of division, his related method of hypothesis, which drew
on geometrical analysis, and the method(s) that Aristotle developed in
his <em>Analytics</em>. Far from a consensus having established itself
over the last two millennia, the relationships between these
methodologies are the subject of increasing debate today. At the heart
of all of them, too, lie the philosophical problems raised by
Meno&rsquo;s paradox, which anticipates what we now know as the
paradox of analysis, concerning how an analysis can be both correct
and informative (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s6.html#4">Moore</a>),
 and Plato&rsquo;s attempt to solve it through the theory of
recollection, which has spawned a vast literature on its own.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Analysis&rsquo; was first used in a methodological sense in
ancient Greek geometry, and the model that Euclidean geometry provided
has been an inspiration ever since. Although Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em> dates from around 300 <small>BCE</small>, and hence
after both Plato and Aristotle, it is clear that it draws on the work
of many previous geometers, most notably, Theaetetus and Eudoxus, who
worked closely with Plato and Aristotle. Plato is even credited by
Diogenes Laertius (<em>LEP</em>, I, 299) with inventing the method of
analysis, but whatever the truth of this may be, the influence of
geometry starts to show in his middle dialogues, and he certainly
encouraged work on geometry in his Academy.</p>

<p>
The classic source for our understanding of ancient Greek geometrical
analysis is a passage in Pappus&rsquo;s <em>Mathematical
Collection</em>, which was composed around 300 <small>CE</small>, and
hence drew on a further six centuries of work in geometry from the
time of Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
Now analysis is the way from what is sought&mdash;as if it were
admitted&mdash;through its concomitants (<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>) in
order[,] to something admitted in synthesis. For in analysis we
suppose that which is sought to be already done, and we inquire from
what it results, and again what is the antecedent of the latter, until
we on our backward way light upon something already known and being
first in order. And we call such a method analysis, as being a
solution backwards (<em>anapalin lysin</em>).

<p>
In synthesis, on the other hand, we suppose that which was reached
last in analysis to be already done, and arranging in their natural
order as consequents (<em>epomena</em>) the former antecedents and
linking them one with another, we in the end arrive at the
construction of the thing sought. And this we call synthesis.
 [<a href="s1.html#Pappus">Full Quotation</a>]</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Analysis is clearly being understood here in the regressive
sense&mdash;as involving the working back from &lsquo;what is
sought&rsquo;, taken as assumed, to something more fundamental by
means of which it can then be established, through its converse,
synthesis (progression). For example, to demonstrate
Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem&mdash;that the square of the hypotenuse of
a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the
other two sides&mdash;we may assume as &lsquo;given&rsquo; a
right-angled triangle with the three squares drawn on its sides. In
investigating the properties of this complex figure we may draw
further (auxiliary) lines between particular points and find that
there are a number of congruent triangles, from which we can begin to
work out the relationship between the relevant areas.
Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem thus depends on theorems about congruent
triangles, and once these&mdash;and other&mdash;theorems have been
identified (and themselves proved), Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem can be
proved. (The theorem is demonstrated in Proposition 47 of Book I of
Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>.)</p>

<p>
The basic idea here provides the core of the conception of analysis
that one can find reflected, in its different ways, in the work of
Plato and Aristotle (see the supplementary sections on
 <a href="s2.html#3">Plato</a>
 and
 <a href="s2.html#4">Aristotle</a>).
 Although detailed examination of actual practices of analysis reveals
more than just regression to first causes, principles or theorems, but
<em>decomposition</em>, <em>transformation</em> and
<em>connection</em> as well (see especially the supplementary section
on
 <a href="s2.html#2">Ancient Greek Geometry</a>),
 the regressive conception dominated views of analysis in Europe until
well into the early modern period.</p>

<p>
Ancient Greek geometry was not the only source of later conceptions of
analysis, however. Plato may not have used the term
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo;, but concern with definition was central to his
dialogues, and definitions have often been seen as what
&lsquo;conceptual analysis&rsquo; should yield. The definition of
&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; as &lsquo;true belief with an account&rsquo;,
to put it in Platonic terms, is one example. (The stock example is the
definition of &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; as &lsquo;justified true
belief&rsquo;, but it is controversial that this is Plato&rsquo;s own
definition and even whether it was offered at all before the middle of
the twentieth century.) Plato&rsquo;s concern may have been with real
rather than nominal definitions, with &lsquo;essences&rsquo; rather
than mental or linguistic contents (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#3">Plato</a>),
 but conceptual analysis, too, has frequently been given a
&lsquo;realist&rsquo; construal. Certainly, the roots of conceptual
analysis can be traced back to Plato&rsquo;s search for definitions,
as we shall see in
 <a href="#EarlModeConcAnal">Section 4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Ancient Greek methodologies can be fruitfully compared with
methodologies in other philosophical traditions. In ancient Chinese
philosophy, for example, there is no Chinese character that could
obviously be translated as &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;, but there was
clearly a concern with finding reasons for things, which involved
identifying and formulating principles, which suggests something akin
to the regressive conception of analysis. There was also concern with
how names divide things up, which bears comparison with Plato&rsquo;s
method of division, and in the Mohist tradition, with providing
definitions of key concepts, such as mathematical and epistemic
concepts, and with certain forms of argumentation (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#5">Ancient Chinese Philosophy</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In ancient Indian philosophy, a web of analytic methodologies begins
to be woven to rival those in ancient Greek philosophy in the areas of
language, logic and epistemology. Here the key inspiration is not
Greek geometrical analysis but Sanskrit grammatical analysis, first
systematized by P&#257;&#7751;ini in the
<em>A&#7779;&#7789;&#257;dhy&#257;y&#299;</em> (<em>Book in Eight
Chapters</em>) in the fifth century <small>BCE</small>. Rules are
formulated for grammatical transformations, which form the basis for
the sophisticated linguistic analyses that are used in the development
of Indian logic and the <em>Ny&#257;ya</em> school of philosophy (see
the supplementary sections on
 <a href="s2.html#6">Ancient Indian Philosophy</a>
 and
 <a href="s3.html#2">Medieval Indian Philosophy</a>).
 This leads to the emergence of a rich Indian tradition of analytic
philosophy in the early modern period that precedes by several
centuries the emergence of the analytic tradition in the West that
originates in the work of Frege, Russell and Moore (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s4.html#6">Indian Analytic Philosophy</a>).</p>

<h2 id="MediRenaConcAnal">3. Medieval and Renaissance Conceptions of Analysis</h2>

<p>
While the early medieval period in Europe was something of a dark age
for philosophy, it thrived in other parts of the world. Indeed, were
it not for the Arabic philosophers in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, who were the main source of the transmission of Greek
philosophy, the dark age would have lasted longer. There was no such
dark age in Indian philosophy, and the division between
&lsquo;ancient&rsquo; and &lsquo;medieval&rsquo; is problematic
anyway, as there was a continual development from its very beginnings
in the <em>Upani&#7779;ads</em>, and a fascinating debate between the
various Vedic and Buddhist schools that deepened well into the modern
period. This debate centred on the inference-schema first formulated
by Gautama in the second century <small>CE</small>, which was analysed
into five components by the <em>Ny&#257;ya</em> school, the school of
logic and epistemology that evolved into the analytic philosophy of
early modern India, and into three components by the Buddhists. There
is a striking similarity between this inference-schema and one of the
basic forms of Aristotelian syllogistic theory, but there are also
crucial differences, reflected in the different natures of Sanskrit
and Greek grammar, at least as they were understood by Indian and
Greek scholars, respectively.</p>

<p>
Buddhism began influencing Chinese philosophy from the first century
<small>CE</small> and there was explicit reflection on the nature of
decompositional analysis&mdash;of a whole into its parts. Fazang,
writing in the seventh century, using two famous metaphors, of a
statue of a golden lion and of a rafter forming part of a building,
argued that the relationship between a whole and its parts has six
characteristics, some of which might seem counterintuitive until we
appreciate the <em>interdependence</em> of a whole and all its parts.
In the Neo-Confucianism that sought to respond to Buddhist and Daoist
attacks on early Confucianism, this interdependence claim was embedded
in a conception of <em>l&#464;</em> (&#29702;), understood as the
&lsquo;pattern&rsquo; or &lsquo;principle&rsquo; that unifies and
underlies all things, a conception that can be compared to the
Neoplatonist conception of the One or God, to which everything can
ultimately be traced back. Here we have clear articulations of a
connective conception of analysis.</p>

<p>
As far as the later medieval and renaissance periods in Europe are
concerned, conceptions of analysis were largely influenced by ancient
Greek thought. Knowledge of these conceptions was often second-hand,
however, filtered through a variety of commentaries and texts that
were not always reliable. Medieval and renaissance methodologies
tended to be uneasy mixtures of Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic,
Galenic, and Neoplatonic elements, many of them claiming to have some
root in the geometrical conception of analysis and synthesis. However,
in the late medieval period, clearer and more original forms of
analysis started to take shape. In the literature on so-called
&lsquo;syncategoremata&rsquo; and &lsquo;exponibilia&rsquo;, for
example, we can trace the development of a conception of interpretive
analysis. Sentences involving more than one quantifier such as
&lsquo;Some donkey every man sees&rsquo;, for example, were recognized
as ambiguous, requiring &lsquo;exposition&rsquo; to clarify. This
parallels similar developments in Indian logic, where sentences
involving quantifiers were reformulated in language that increasingly
became more technical, building on the grammatical analyses that
successive Sanskrit scholars had offered.</p>

<p>
In John Buridan&rsquo;s masterpiece of the mid-fourteenth century, the
<em>Summulae de Dialectica</em>, we can find three of the four
conceptions outlined in
 <a href="#CharAnal">Section 1.1</a>
 above. He distinguishes explicitly between divisions, definitions,
and demonstrations, corresponding to decompositional, interpretive,
and regressive analysis, respectively. Here, in particular, we have
anticipations of modern analytic philosophy as much as reworkings of
ancient philosophy. Unfortunately, however, these clearer forms of
analysis became overshadowed during the Renaissance, despite&mdash;or
perhaps because of&mdash;the growing interest in the original Greek
sources. As far as understanding analytic methodologies was concerned,
the humanist repudiation of scholastic logic muddied the waters.</p>

<h2 id="EarlModeConcAnal">4. Early Modern Conceptions of Analysis</h2>

<p>
In Europe, the scientific revolution in the seventeenth century
brought with it new forms of analysis. The newest of these emerged
through the development of more sophisticated mathematical techniques,
but even these still had their roots in earlier conceptions of
analysis. By the end of the early modern period, decompositional
analysis had become dominant (as outlined in what follows), but this,
too, took different forms, and the relationships between the various
conceptions of analysis were often far from clear.</p>

<p>
In common with the Renaissance, the early modern period in Europe was
marked by a great concern with methodology. This might seem
unsurprising in such a revolutionary period, when new techniques for
understanding the world were being developed and that understanding
itself was being transformed. But what characterizes many of the
treatises and remarks on methodology that appeared in the seventeenth
century is their appeal, frequently self-conscious, to ancient methods
(despite, or perhaps&mdash;for diplomatic reasons&mdash;because of,
the critique of the <em>content</em> of traditional thought), although
new wine was generally poured into the old bottles. The model of
geometrical analysis was a particular inspiration here, albeit
filtered through the Aristotelian tradition, which had assimilated the
regressive process of going from theorems to axioms with that of
moving from effects to causes (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#4">Aristotle</a>).
 Analysis came to be seen as a method of discovery, working back from
what is ordinarily known to the underlying reasons (demonstrating
&lsquo;the fact&rsquo;), and synthesis as a method of proof, working
forwards again from what is discovered to what needed explanation
(demonstrating &lsquo;the reason why&rsquo;). Analysis and synthesis
were thus taken as complementary, although there remained disagreement
over their respective merits.</p>

<p>
There is a manuscript by Galileo, dating from around 1589, an
appropriated commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>, which shows his concern with methodology, and
regressive analysis, in particular (see Wallace 1992a and 1992b).
Hobbes wrote a chapter on method in the first part of <em>De
Corpore</em>, published in 1655, which offers his own interpretation
of the method of analysis and synthesis, where decompositional forms
of analysis are articulated alongside regressive forms
 {<a href="s1.html#Hobbes">Quotations</a>}.
 But perhaps the most influential account of methodology, from the
middle of the seventeenth century until well into the nineteenth
century, was the fourth part of the Port-Royal <em>Logic</em>, the
first edition of which appeared in 1662 and the final revised edition
in 1683. Chapter 2 (which was the first chapter in the first edition)
opens as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
The art of arranging a series of thoughts properly, either for
discovering the truth when we do not know it, or for proving to others
what we already know, can generally be called method.

<p>
Hence there are two kinds of method, one for discovering the truth,
which is known as <em>analysis</em>, or the <em>method of
resolution</em>, and which can also be called the <em>method of
discovery</em>. The other is for making the truth understood by others
once it is found. This is known as <em>synthesis</em>, or the
<em>method of composition</em>, and can also be called the <em>method
of instruction</em>.
 {<a href="s1.html#Arnauld">Fuller Quotations</a>}</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
That a number of different methods might be assimilated here is not
noted, although the text does go on to distinguish four main types of
&lsquo;issues concerning things&rsquo;: seeking causes by their
effects, seeking effects by their causes, finding the whole from the
parts, and looking for another part from the whole and a given part
(ibid., 234). While the first two involve regressive analysis and
synthesis, the third and fourth involve decompositional analysis and
synthesis&mdash;or decompositional and connective analysis, as we
might also understand it.</p>

<p>
As the authors of the <em>Logic</em> make clear, this particular part
of their text derives from Descartes&rsquo;s <em>Rules for the
Direction of the Mind</em>, written around 1627, but only published
posthumously in 1684. The specification of the four types was most
likely offered in elaborating Descartes&rsquo;s Rule Thirteen, which
states: &ldquo;If we perfectly understand a problem we must abstract
it from every superfluous conception, reduce it to its simplest terms
and, by means of an enumeration, divide it up into the smallest
possible parts&rdquo; (<em>PW</em>, I, 51. Cf. the editorial comments
in <em>PW</em>, I, 54, 77). The decompositional conception of analysis
is explicit here, and if we follow this up into the later
<em>Discourse on Method</em>, published in 1637, the focus has clearly
shifted from the regressive to the decompositional conception of
analysis. All the rules offered in the earlier work have now been
reduced to just four. This is how Descartes reports the rules he says
he adopted in his scientific and philosophical work:</p>

<blockquote>
The first was never to accept anything as true if I did not have
evident knowledge of its truth: that is, carefully to avoid
precipitate conclusions and preconceptions, and to include nothing
more in my judgements than what presented itself to my mind so clearly
and so distinctly that I had no occasion to doubt it.

<p>
The second, to divide each of the difficulties I examined into as many
parts as possible and as may be required in order to resolve them
better.</p>

<p>
The third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly manner, by beginning
with the simplest and most easily known objects in the order to ascend
little by little, step by step, to knowledge of the most complex, and
by supposing some order even among objects that have no natural order
of precedence.</p>

<p>
And the last, throughout to make enumerations so complete, and reviews
so comprehensive, that I could be sure of leaving nothing out.
(<em>PW</em>, I, 120.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first two are rules of analysis (decompositional analysis) and the
second two rules of synthesis (connective analysis). But although the
analysis/synthesis structure remains, what is involved here is
decomposition/composition (decomposition/connection) rather than
regression/progression. Nevertheless, Descartes insisted that it was
geometry that influenced him here: &ldquo;Those long chains composed
of very simple and easy reasonings, which geometers customarily use to
arrive at their most difficult demonstrations, had given me occasion
to suppose that all the things which can fall under human knowledge
are interconnected in the same way&rdquo; (Ibid.
 {<a href="s1.html#Descartes">Further Quotations</a>}).</p>
 
<p>
Descartes&rsquo;s geometry did indeed involve the breaking down of
complex problems into simpler ones. More significant, however, was his
use of algebra in developing &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; geometry as it
came to be called, which allowed geometrical problems to be
transformed into arithmetical ones and more easily solved. In
representing the &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; to be found by
&lsquo;<em>x</em>&rsquo;, we can see the central role played in
analysis by the idea of taking something as &lsquo;given&rsquo; and
working back from that, which made it seem appropriate to regard
algebra as an &lsquo;art of analysis&rsquo;, alluding to the
regressive conception of the ancients. Illustrated in analytic
geometry in its developed form, then, we can see all four of the
conceptions of analysis outlined in
 <a href="#CharAnal">Section 1.1</a>
 above, despite Descartes&rsquo;s own emphasis on the decompositional
conception. For further discussion of this, see the supplementary
section on
 <a href="s4.html#2">Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Descartes&rsquo;s emphasis on decompositional analysis was not without
precedents, however. Not only was it already involved in ancient Greek
geometry, but it was also implicit in Plato&rsquo;s method of
collection and division. We might explain the shift from regressive to
decompositional (conceptual) analysis, as well as the connection
between the two, in the following way. Consider a simple example, as
represented in the diagram below, &lsquo;collecting&rsquo; all animals
and &lsquo;dividing&rsquo; them into <em>rational</em> and
<em>non-rational</em>, in order to define human beings as rational
animals.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img class="nocaption" alt="A box labeled 'Animal' has connector lines to two boxes underneath: one labeled 'Rational', the other labeled 'Non-rational'." src="Diagplat.jpg" style="width:295px" />
</div>

<p>
On this model, in seeking to define anything, we work back up the
appropriate classificatory hierarchy to find the higher (i.e., more
basic or more general) &lsquo;Forms&rsquo;, by means of which we can
lay down the definition. Although Plato did not himself use the term
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo;&mdash;the word for &lsquo;division&rsquo; was
&lsquo;<em>dihairesis</em>&rsquo;&mdash;the finding of the appropriate
&lsquo;Forms&rsquo; is essentially analysis. As an elaboration of the
Socratic search for definitions, we clearly have in this the origins
of conceptual analysis. There is little disagreement that &lsquo;Human
beings are rational animals&rsquo; is the kind of definition we are
seeking, defining one concept, the concept <em>human being</em>, in
terms of other concepts, the concepts <em>rational</em> and
<em>animal</em>. But the construals that have been offered of this
have been more problematic. Understanding a classificatory hierarchy
<em>extensionally</em>, that is, in terms of the classes of things
denoted, the classes higher up are clearly the larger,
&lsquo;containing&rsquo; the classes lower down as subclasses (e.g.,
the class of animals includes the class of human beings as one of its
subclasses). <em>Intensionally</em>, however, the relationship of
&lsquo;containment&rsquo; has been seen as holding in the opposite
direction. If someone understands the concept <em>human being</em>, at
least in the strong sense of knowing its definition, then they must
understand the concepts <em>animal</em> and <em>rational</em>; and it
has often then seemed natural to talk of the concept <em>human
being</em> as &lsquo;containing&rsquo; the concepts <em>rational</em>
and <em>animal</em>. Working back up the hierarchy in
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; (in the regressive sense) could then come to be
identified with &lsquo;unpacking&rsquo; or &lsquo;decomposing&rsquo; a
concept into its &lsquo;constituent&rsquo; concepts
(&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; in the decompositional sense). Of course,
talking of &lsquo;decomposing&rsquo; a concept into its
&lsquo;constituents&rsquo; is, strictly speaking, only a metaphor (as
Quine was famously to remark in &sect;1 of &lsquo;Two Dogmas of
Empiricism&rsquo;), but in the early modern period, this began to be
taken more literally.</p>

<p>
As far as the history of analytic philosophy is concerned, however,
the most significant development in the early modern period was the
emergence of Indian analytic philosophy, as it should undoubtedly be
characterized. Building on Ga&#7749;ge&#347;a&rsquo;s
fourteenth-century text, <em>Jewel of Reflection on the Truth</em>
(<em>Tattvacint&#257;ma&#7751;i</em>), the earlier work of the
<em>Ny&#257;ya</em> school, which had focused on logic and
epistemology, was elaborated with ever greater technical
sophistication into what became known as the <em>Navya-Ny&#257;ya</em>
or new <em>Ny&#257;ya</em> school. No one who reads their commentaries
and expositions can fail to be struck by how closely their concerns
match those of analytic philosophers today (see the entry on
 <a href="../early-modern-india/">Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India</a>).
 Not only do we find conceptual analysis being pursued, in the sense
of seeking necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of
key philosophical concepts, but there is also explicit use of
interpretive analysis in finding precise formulations to resolve
philosophical debates, especially in responding to the epistemological
scepticism of the Buddhists.</p>

<p>
There was similar concern to counteract the influence of Buddhism in
early modern Chinese philosophy, where it took the form of developing
new versions of Confucianism. Dai Zhen was the most significant
figure, his work characterized by seeking to uncover the original
meaning of Confucianism in the ancient texts, by careful philological
analysis that also sifted out the wheat from the chaff&mdash;as Dai
saw it&mdash;in the extensive commentaries on those texts. Dai talks
explicitly of a &lsquo;principle of analysis&rsquo;, as
&lsquo;<em>f&#275;nl&#464;</em>&rsquo; (&#20998;&#29702;) might be
translated, &lsquo;<em>f&#275;n</em>&rsquo; (&#20998;) meaning
&lsquo;divide&rsquo; or &lsquo;separate&rsquo;, forming the first part
of <em>f&#275;nx&#299;</em>&rsquo; (&#20998;&#26512;), as used in
Chinese today for &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; or &lsquo;analyse&rsquo;,
where &lsquo;<em>x&#299;</em>&rsquo; (&#26512;) means
&lsquo;divide&rsquo; or &lsquo;separate&rsquo;, too. This is clearly
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; in its decompositional sense, but Dai saw
identifying the parts of something as essential in understanding the
&lsquo;pattern&rsquo; (<em>l&#464;</em> &#29702;) that unifies those
parts, so a connective conception of analysis is also at work
here.</p>

<h2 id="ModeConcAnalOutsAnalPhil">5. Modern Conceptions of Analysis, outside Analytic Philosophy</h2>

<p>
As suggested in the supplementary document on
 <a href="s4.html#5">Kant</a>,
 both the decompositional and regressive conceptions of analysis found
their classic statements in the work of Kant at the end of the
eighteenth century. But Kant was only expressing conceptions
widespread in Europe at the time. The decompositional conception can
be found in a very blatant form, for example, in the writings of Moses
Mendelssohn, for whom, unlike Kant, it was applicable even in the case
of geometry
 {<a href="s1.html#Mendelssohn">Quotation</a>}.
 Typified in Kant&rsquo;s and Mendelssohn&rsquo;s view of concepts, it
was also reflected in scientific practice. Indeed, its popularity was
fostered by the chemical revolution inaugurated by Lavoisier in the
late eighteenth century, the comparison between philosophical analysis
and chemical analysis being frequently drawn. As Lichtenberg put it,
&ldquo;Whichever way you look at it, philosophy is always analytical
chemistry&rdquo;
 {<a href="s1.html#Lichtenberg">Quotation</a>}.
 The regressive conception, meanwhile, is given a particularly clear
formulation in the work of Johann Heinrich Lambert
 {<a href="s1.html#Lambert1">Quotation</a>}.</p>
 
<p>
This decompositional conception of analysis set the methodological
agenda for philosophical approaches and debates in the (late) modern
period (from the nineteenth century onwards) in Europe. Responses and
developments, very broadly, can be divided into two. On the one hand,
an essentially decompositional conception of analysis was accepted,
but a critical attitude was adopted towards it. If analysis simply
involved breaking something down, then it appeared destructive and
life-diminishing, and the critique of analysis that this view
engendered was a common theme in idealism and romanticism in all its
main varieties&mdash;from German, British, and French to North
American. One finds it reflected, for example, in remarks about the
negating and soul-destroying power of analytical thinking by Schiller
 {<a href="s1.html#Schiller">Quotation</a>},
 de Sta&euml;l
 {<a href="s1.html#DeStael">Quotation</a>},
 Hegel
 {<a href="s1.html#Hegel">Quotation</a>},
 and de Chardin
 {<a href="s1.html#DeChardin">Quotation</a>},
 in Bradley&rsquo;s doctrine that analysis is falsification
 {<a href="s1.html#Bradley">Quotation</a>},
 and in the emphasis placed by Bergson on &lsquo;intuition&rsquo;
 {<a href="s1.html#Bergson">Quotation</a>}.</p>
 
<p>
On the other hand, analysis was seen more positively, but the Kantian
decompositional conception underwent a certain degree of modification
and development. In the nineteenth century, this was exemplified, in
particular, by Bolzano and the neo-Kantians. Bolzano&rsquo;s most
important innovation was the method of variation, which involves
considering what happens to the truth-value of a sentence when a
constituent term is substituted by another. This formed the basis for
his reconstruction of the analytic/synthetic distinction, Kant&rsquo;s
account of which, with respect to judgements, he found defective. The
neo-Kantians emphasized the role of structure in conceptualized
experience and had a greater appreciation of forms of analysis in
mathematics and science. In many ways, their work attempts to do
justice to philosophical and scientific practice while recognizing the
central idealist claim that analysis is a kind of abstraction that
inevitably involves falsification or distortion. On the neo-Kantian
view, the complexity of experience is a complexity of form and content
rather than of separable constituents, requiring analysis into
&lsquo;moments&rsquo; or &lsquo;aspects&rsquo; rather than
&lsquo;elements&rsquo; or &lsquo;parts&rsquo;. In the 1910s, the idea
was articulated with great subtlety by Ernst Cassirer
 {<a href="s1.html#Cassirer">Quotation</a>},
 and became familiar in Gestalt psychology.</p>

<p>
The Kantian regressive conception of analysis, too, underwent
modification and development, as can be seen, for example, in the
works of his idealist successor, J. G. Fichte. Although Kant wrote the
<em>Prolegomena</em> according to the analytic or regressive method,
he nonetheless maintained that the proper method of a scientific
philosophy is synthetic or progressive
 {<a href="s1.html#KantAM">Quotation</a>}.
 In opposition to this, Fichte, in his introductory remarks to Part II
of his <em>Foundation to the Entire Wissenschaftslehre</em>, states
that the philosophical investigations that follow can only be
conducted according to an analytic method. This is because, as Fichte
explains, these investigations are reflective discoveries of
individual intellectual acts that are already present and
synthetically unified within a larger whole, which whole is the
condition for the possibility of these reflective investigations in
the first place (<em>FGA,</em> I, 2, 283&ndash;5). Fichte thus
modifies the Kantian conception of regressive analysis by combining it
with the decompositional and connective conceptions. His method is
analytic in the regressive sense in that it is a reflection aimed at
articulating its own condition of possibility, analytic in the
decompositional sense in that it is a decomposition of a synthetically
unified whole into its component acts, and analytic in the connective
sense in that these component acts are always related to the
synthetically unified whole they comprise.</p>

<p>
In the twentieth century, both (Western) analytic philosophy and
phenomenology can be seen as developing far more sophisticated
conceptions of analysis, which draw on but go beyond mere
decompositional analysis. The following
 <a href="#ConcAnalAnalPhil">Section</a>
 offers an account of analysis in analytic philosophy, illustrating
the range and richness of the conceptions and practices that arose.
But it is important to see these in the wider context of
twentieth-century methodological practices and debates, for it is not
just in &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; philosophy&mdash;despite its
name&mdash;that analytic methods are accorded a central role.
Phenomenology, in particular, contains its own distinctive set of
analytic methods, with similarities and differences to those of
analytic philosophy. Phenomenological analysis has frequently been
compared to conceptual clarification in the ordinary language
tradition, for example, and the method of &lsquo;phenomenological
reduction&rsquo; that Husserl invented in 1905 offers a striking
parallel to the reductive project opened up by Russell&rsquo;s theory
of descriptions, which also made its appearance in 1905.</p>

<p>
Just like Frege and Russell, Husserl&rsquo;s initial concern was with
the foundations of mathematics, and in this shared concern we can see
the continued influence of the regressive conception of analysis.
According to Husserl, the aim of &lsquo;eidetic reduction&rsquo;, as
he called it, was to isolate the &lsquo;essences&rsquo; that underlie
our various forms of thinking, and to apprehend them by
&lsquo;essential intuition&rsquo;
(&lsquo;<em>Wesenserschauung</em>&rsquo;). The terminology may be
different, but this resembles Russell&rsquo;s early project to
identify the &lsquo;indefinables&rsquo; of philosophical logic, as he
described it, and to apprehend them by &lsquo;acquaintance&rsquo; (cf.
<em>POM</em>, xx). Furthermore, in Husserl&rsquo;s later discussion of
&lsquo;explication&rsquo; (cf. <em>EJ</em>, &sect;&sect; 22&ndash;4
 {<a href="s1.html#Husserl">Quotations</a>}),
 we find appreciation of the &lsquo;transformative&rsquo; dimension of
analysis, which can be fruitfully compared with Carnap&rsquo;s account
of explication (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s6.html#7">Rudolf Carnap and Logical Positivism</a>).
 Carnap himself describes Husserl&rsquo;s idea here as one of
&ldquo;the synthesis of identification between a confused,
nonarticulated sense and a subsequently intended distinct, articulated
sense&rdquo; (1950, 3
 {<a href="s1.html#Carnap">Quotation</a>}).</p>
 
<p>
Phenomenology is not the only source of analytic methodologies outside
those of the analytic tradition. Mention might be made here, too, of
R. G. Collingwood, working within the tradition of British idealism,
which was still a powerful force prior to the Second World War. In his
<em>Essay on Philosophical Method</em> (1933), for example, he
criticizes Moorean philosophy, and develops his own response to what
is essentially the paradox of analysis (concerning how an analysis can
be both correct and informative), which he recognizes as having its
root in Meno&rsquo;s paradox. In his <em>Essay on Metaphysics</em>
(1940), he puts forward his own conception of metaphysical analysis,
in direct response to what he perceived as the mistaken repudiation of
metaphysics by the logical positivists. Metaphysical analysis is
characterized here as the detection of &lsquo;absolute
presuppositions&rsquo;, which are taken as underlying and shaping the
various conceptual practices that can be identified in the history of
philosophy and science (see Beaney 2005). Even among those explicitly
critical of central strands in analytic philosophy, then, analysis in
one form or another can still be seen as alive and well.</p>

<p>
When it comes to the various traditions of Asian philosophy, their
further development was disrupted by colonialism, which decimated the
Indian analytic tradition, for example. There was argument about the
respective merits of Indian and European forms of logic and analysis,
reflected in debates about the so-called &lsquo;Hindu
syllogism&rsquo;, which led some Indian philosophers to return to the
older, Vedic sources of philosophy to find something that was more
distinctive and hence less readily comparable to Western forms of
philosophy, by which it always seemed (mistakenly) to come off
second-best. It was not until the 1970s, in the pioneering work of B.
K. Matilal, that the Indian analytic tradition finally began to be
recognized in the West (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s5.html#9">Indian Philosophy</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Colonialism also had a transformative effect on Chinese philosophy. As
the Qing dynasty disintegrated around the turn of the twentieth
century, there was growing rejection of Confucianism and a turn
towards the West for social and cultural renewal. Western logical and
philosophical texts were translated, and a new generation of Chinese
intellectuals returned from studying in Europe and the US to introduce
new ideas and reconstruct their own historical traditions to offer new
resources for understanding and changing the present (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s5.html#10">Chinese Philosophy</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ConcAnalAnalPhil">6. Conceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy</h2>

<p>
If anything characterizes &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; philosophy in the
West, then it is presumably the emphasis placed on analysis. But as
the foregoing sections have shown, there is a wide range of
conceptions of analysis, so such a characterization says nothing that
would distinguish analytic philosophy from much of what has either
preceded or developed alongside it. Given that the decompositional
conception is frequently offered as the main conception today, it
might be thought that it is this that characterizes analytic
philosophy. But this conception was prevalent in the early modern
period, shared by both the British Empiricists and Leibniz, for
example. Given that Kant denied the importance of decompositional
analysis, however, it might be suggested that what characterizes
analytic philosophy is the <em>value</em> it places on such analysis.
This might be true of Moore&rsquo;s early work, and of one strand
within analytic philosophy; but it is not generally true. What
characterizes analytic philosophy as it was founded by Frege and
Russell is the role played by <em>logical analysis</em>, which
depended on the development of modern logic. Although other and
subsequent forms of analysis, such as linguistic analysis, were less
wedded to systems of formal logic, the central insight motivating
logical analysis remained.</p>

<p>
Pappus&rsquo;s account of method in ancient Greek geometry suggests
that the regressive conception of analysis was dominant at the
time&mdash;however much other conceptions may also have been
implicitly involved (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#2">Ancient Greek Geometry</a>).
 In the early modern period, the decompositional conception became
widespread (see
 <a href="#EarlModeConcAnal">Section 4</a>).
 What characterizes analytic philosophy&mdash;or at least that central
strand that originates in the work of Frege and Russell&mdash;is the
recognition of what was called earlier the <em>interpretive</em> or
<em>transformative</em> dimension of analysis (see
 <a href="#CharAnal">Section 1.1</a>).
 Any analysis presupposes a particular framework of interpretation,
and work is done in <em>interpreting</em> what we are seeking to
analyse as part of the process of regression and decomposition. This
may involve <em>transforming</em> it in some way, in order for the
resources of a given theory or conceptual framework to be brought to
bear. Euclidean geometry provides a good illustration of this. But it
is even more obvious in the case of analytic geometry, where the
geometrical problem is first &lsquo;translated&rsquo; into the
language of algebra and arithmetic in order to solve it more easily
(see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s4.html#2">Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a>).
 What Descartes and Fermat did for analytic geometry, Frege and
Russell did for analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo; much more in the sense that analytic geometry
is &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; than in the crude decompositional sense that
Kant understood it.</p>

<p>
The interpretive dimension of modern philosophical analysis can also
be seen as anticipated in medieval scholasticism (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s3.html#1">Medieval European Philosophy</a>),
 and it is remarkable just how much of modern concerns with
propositions, meaning, reference, and so on, can be found in the
medieval literature. They can also be found in early modern Indian
philosophy (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s4.html#6">Indian Analytic Philosophy</a>).
 Interpretive analysis is also illustrated in the nineteenth century
by Bentham&rsquo;s conception of <em>paraphrasis</em>, which he
characterized as &ldquo;that sort of exposition which may be afforded
by transmuting into a proposition, having for its subject some real
entity, a proposition which has not for its subject any other than a
fictitious entity&rdquo;
 [<a href="s1.html#Bentham">Full Quotation</a>].
 He applied the idea in &lsquo;analysing away&rsquo; talk of
&lsquo;obligations&rsquo;, and the anticipation that we can see here
of Russell&rsquo;s theory of descriptions has been noted by, among
others, Wisdom (1931) and Quine in &lsquo;Five Milestones of
Empiricism&rsquo;
 [<a href="s1.html#Quine">Quotation</a>].</p>
 
<p>
What was crucial in the emergence of twentieth-century analytic
philosophy, however, was the development of quantificational theory,
which provided a far more powerful interpretive system than anything
that had hitherto been available. In the case of Frege and Russell,
the system into which statements were &lsquo;translated&rsquo; was
predicate logic, and the divergence that was thereby opened up between
grammatical and logical form meant that the process of translation
itself became an issue of philosophical concern. This induced greater
self-consciousness about our use of language and its potential to
mislead us, and inevitably raised semantic, epistemological and
metaphysical questions about the relationships between language,
logic, thought and reality which have been at the core of analytic
philosophy ever since.</p>

<p>
Both Frege and Russell (after the latter&rsquo;s initial flirtation
with idealism) were concerned to show, against Kant, that arithmetic
is a system of analytic and not synthetic truths. In the
<em>Grundlagen</em>, Frege had offered a revised conception of
analyticity, which arguably endorses and generalizes Kant&rsquo;s
logical as opposed to phenomenological criterion, i.e., (AN<sub>L</sub>)
rather than (AN<sub>O</sub>) (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s4.html#5">Kant</a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>
(AN) A truth is <em>analytic</em> if its proof depends only on general
logical laws and definitions.
</blockquote>

<p>
The question of whether arithmetical truths are analytic then comes
down to the question of whether they can be derived purely logically.
(Here we already have &lsquo;transformation&rsquo;, at the theoretical
level&mdash;involving a reinterpretation of the concept of
analyticity.) To demonstrate this, Frege realized that he needed to
develop logical theory in order to formalize mathematical statements,
which typically involve multiple generality (e.g., &lsquo;Every
natural number has a successor&rsquo;, i.e. &lsquo;For every natural
number <em>x</em> there is another natural number <em>y</em> that is
the successor of <em>x</em>&rsquo;). This development, by extending
the use of function-argument analysis in mathematics to logic and
providing a notation for quantification, was essentially the
achievement of his first book, the <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (1879),
where he not only created the first system of predicate logic but
also, using it, succeeded in giving a logical analysis of mathematical
induction (see Frege <em>FR</em>, 47&ndash;78).</p>

<p>
In his second book, <em>Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik</em> (1884),
Frege went on to provide a logical analysis of number statements. His
central idea was that a number statement contains an assertion about a
concept. A statement such as &lsquo;Jupiter has four moons&rsquo; is
to be understood not as predicating of Jupiter the property of having
four moons, but as predicating of the concept <em>moon of Jupiter</em>
the second-level property <em>has four instances</em>, which can be
logically defined. The significance of this construal can be brought
out by considering negative existential statements (which are
equivalent to number statements involving the number 0). Take the
following negative existential statement:</p>

<blockquote>
(0a) Unicorns do not exist.
</blockquote>

<p>
If we attempt to analyse this <em>decompositionally</em>, taking its
grammatical form to mirror its logical form, then we find ourselves
asking what these unicorns are that have the property of
non-existence. We may then be forced to posit the
<em>subsistence</em>&mdash;as opposed to <em>existence</em>&mdash;of
unicorns, just as Meinong and the early Russell did, in order for
there to be something that is the subject of our statement. On the
Fregean account, however, to deny that something exists is to say that
the relevant <em>concept</em> has no instances: there is no need to
posit any mysterious <em>object</em>. The Fregean analysis of (0a)
consists in <em>rephrasing</em> it into (0b), which can then be
readily formalized in the new logic as (0c):</p>

<blockquote>
(0b) The concept <em>unicorn</em> is not instantiated.

<p>
(0c) ~(&exist;<em>x</em>) <em>Fx</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, to say that God exists is to say that the concept
<em>God</em> is (uniquely) instantiated, i.e., to deny that the
concept has 0 instances (or 2 or more instances). On this view,
existence is no longer seen as a (first-level) predicate, but instead,
existential statements are analysed in terms of the (second-level)
predicate <em>is instantiated</em>, represented by means of the
existential quantifier. As Frege notes, this offers a neat diagnosis
of what is wrong with the ontological argument, at least in its
traditional form (<em>GL</em>, &sect;53). All the problems that arise
if we try to apply decompositional analysis (at least straight off)
simply drop away, although an account is still needed, of course, of
concepts and quantifiers.</p>

<p>
The possibilities that this strategy of &lsquo;translating&rsquo; into
a logical language opens up are enormous: we are no longer forced to
treat the surface grammatical form of a statement as a guide to its
&lsquo;real&rsquo; form, and are provided with a means of representing
that form. This is the value of logical analysis: it allows us to
&lsquo;analyse away&rsquo; problematic linguistic expressions and
explain what it is &lsquo;really&rsquo; going on. This strategy was
employed, most famously, in Russell&rsquo;s theory of descriptions,
which was a major motivation behind the ideas of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
<em>Tractatus</em> (see the supplementary sections on
 <a href="s6.html#3">Bertrand Russell</a>
 and
 <a href="s6.html#5">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>).
 Although subsequent philosophers were to question the assumption that
there could ever be a definitive logical analysis of a given
statement, the idea that ordinary language may be systematically
misleading has remained.</p>

<p>
To illustrate this, consider the following examples from Ryle&rsquo;s
classic 1932 paper, &lsquo;Systematically Misleading
Expressions&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
(Ua) Unpunctuality is reprehensible.

<p>
(Ta) Jones hates the thought of going to hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In each case, we might be tempted to make unnecessary reifications,
taking &lsquo;unpunctuality&rsquo; and &lsquo;the thought of going to
hospital&rsquo; as referring to objects. It is because of this that
Ryle describes such expressions as &lsquo;systematically
misleading&rsquo;. (Ua) and (Ta) must therefore be rephrased:</p>

<blockquote>
(Ub) Whoever is unpunctual deserves that other people should reprove
him for being unpunctual.

<p>
(Tb) Jones feels distressed when he thinks of what he will undergo if
he goes to hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In these formulations, there is no overt talk at all of
&lsquo;unpunctuality&rsquo; or &lsquo;thoughts&rsquo;, and hence
nothing to tempt us to posit the existence of any corresponding
entities. The problems that otherwise arise have thus been
&lsquo;analysed away&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
At the time that Ryle wrote &lsquo;Systematically Misleading
Expressions&rsquo;, he, too, assumed that every statement had an
underlying logical form that was to be exhibited in its
&lsquo;correct&rsquo; formulation
 [<a href="s1.html#Ryle">Quotations</a>].
 But when he gave up this assumption (for reasons indicated in the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s6.html#6">Susan Stebbing and the Cambridge School of Analysis</a>),
 he did not give up the motivating idea of logical analysis&mdash;to
show what is wrong with misleading expressions. In <em>The Concept of
Mind</em> (1949), for example, he sought to explain what he called the
&lsquo;category-mistake&rsquo; involved in talk of the mind as a kind
of &lsquo;Ghost in the Machine&rsquo;. His aim, he wrote, was to
&ldquo;rectify the logical geography of the knowledge which we already
possess&rdquo; (1949, 9), an idea that was to lead to the articulation
of <em>connective</em> rather than <em>reductive</em> conceptions of
analysis, the emphasis being placed on elucidating the relationships
between concepts without assuming that there is a privileged set of
intrinsically basic concepts (see the supplementary section on
 <a href="s6.html#8">Oxford Linguistic Philosophy</a>).</p>
 
<p>
What these various forms of logical analysis suggest, then, is that
what characterizes analysis in analytic philosophy is something far
richer than the mere &lsquo;decomposition&rsquo; of a concept into its
&lsquo;constituents&rsquo;. But this is not to say that the
decompositional conception of analysis plays no role at all. It can be
found in the early work of Moore, for example (see the supplementary
section on
 <a href="s6.html#4">G. E. Moore</a>).
 It might also be seen as reflected in the approach to the analysis of
concepts that seeks to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions
for their correct employment. Conceptual analysis in this sense goes
back to the Socrates of Plato&rsquo;s early dialogues (see the
supplementary section on
 <a href="s2.html#3">Plato</a>).
 But it arguably reached its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. As
mentioned in
 <a href="#AnciConcAnal">Section 2</a>
 above, the definition of &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; as &lsquo;justified
true belief&rsquo; is perhaps the most famous example, although the
claim made by Gettier in his classic paper of 1963 in criticizing this
definition that it was the dominant conception is now recognized as
historically false. (For details of this, see the entry in this
Encyclopedia on
 <a href="../knowledge-analysis/">The Analysis of Knowledge</a>.)
 The specification of necessary and sufficient conditions may no
longer be seen as the primary aim of conceptual analysis, especially
in the case of philosophical concepts such as &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;,
which are fiercely contested; but consideration of such conditions
remains a useful tool in the analytic philosopher&rsquo;s toolbag.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The history of philosophy reveals a rich source of conceptions of
analysis. The origin of analytic methodology in the West lay in
ancient Greek geometry, but it developed in different though related
ways in the two Greek traditions stemming from Plato and Aristotle,
the former based on the search for definitions and the latter on the
idea of regression to first causes. The origin of analytic methodology
in India lay in Sanskrit grammar, and it developed through elaboration
of the inference-schema of the <em>Ny&#257;ya</em> school of logic and
epistemology, which in turn influenced Chinese philosophy through
Buddhism. These traditions defined methodological space until well
into the early modern period, and indeed, in the Indian tradition,
reached its high point in the analytic philosophy developed by the
<em>Navya-Ny&#257;ya</em> school. The creation of analytic geometry in
the seventeenth century introduced a more reductive form of analysis
in Europe, and an analogous and even more powerful form was introduced
around the turn of the twentieth century in the logical work of Frege
and Russell. Although conceptual analysis, construed decompositionally
from the time of Leibniz and Kant, and mediated by the work of Moore,
is often viewed as characteristic of analytic philosophy, logical
analysis, taken as involving translation into a logical system, is
what inaugurated the analytic tradition in Europe. Analysis has also
frequently been seen as reductive, but connective forms of analysis
are no less important, not least in reflecting the complementarity of
analysis and synthesis. As shown in this entry, connective analysis,
historically inflected, would seem to be particularly appropriate in
analysing analysis itself.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>
This entry was first composed by Michael Beaney in 2002&ndash;3 and
updated in 2007 and 2014: acknowledgements for each of these can be
found in the archived versions. The most substantial revision, with
the help of Thomas Raysmith, has been made for this current version
(2023), in covering many more philosophical traditions. Various people
have made comments and suggestions over the years, and trying to name
everyone would inevitably miss many out. So we just record our thanks
here: we have tried to respond appropriately in all cases. For
institutional support over the last six years, however, we would
especially like to thank the Institut f&uuml;r Philosophie at the
Humboldt-Universit&auml;t zu Berlin. As we seek to broaden the account
of analysis offered here, in seeking greater inclusivity to avoid
Eurocentrism, which cannot be done in a single revision, we invite
anyone who has further suggestions of what to cover or comments on the
article itself to email us at the addresses given below.</p>
