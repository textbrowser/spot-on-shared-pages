<h1>Feminist Perspectives on Trans Issues</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Sep 26, 2009; substantive revision Fri Nov 21, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The relationship between feminist and trans theory and politics is
surprisingly fraught. The goal in this entry is to outline some of the
key philosophical issues at the intersections, and this can be
accomplished only by attending to the history thereof. This entry will
therefore follow a roughly chronological order, although there will
also be some deviations in the timeline to provide sustained
philosophical engagements on specific points. While the early
theorizing about trans issues did not occur in the discipline of
philosophy, some of it has been included because of its philosophical
character and pertinence to subsequent disciplinary discussions.
Further, because much of the theory arose from on-the-ground political
engagements, this entry will mention those engagements. And for
additional coverage on the topic more broadly construed, see the
general entry on
 <a href="../trans/">trans philosophy</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Although there are many topics that might be covered, this entry will
focus on some of the most general sets of questions. The first are
prima facie metaphysical ones. They include the questions what women
and men are &ndash; questions which might be understood as questions
about concepts, meanings of terms, or kinds. They also include the
question whether trans self-identifying claims are typically valid
(e.g., whether a trans woman who says she is a woman, is a woman).
Sometimes this last sort of question is framed as the question whether
trans women are women and trans men are men. However, since some trans
women and men self-identify as nonbinary, the initial formulation
ought to be considered more precise.</p>

<p>
The second set of questions are prima facie political ones. They
include questions how the oppression of women and the oppression of
trans people ought to be understood. To put it differently &ndash; if
both women and trans people can be oppressed through gender then it
would appear that multiple forms of gender oppression are possible. If
so, how ought this be theorized? Are feminist politics and trans
politics necessarily at odds with each other? Is it possible for trans
forms of oppression and sexist forms of oppression to intermesh with
each other? What might an intersectional trans feminist look like?</p>

<p>
A note on terminology. &ldquo;Trans terminology&rdquo; has continued
to change over time and at any given time has been subject to
political and semantic contestation. For example, while
&ldquo;transsexual&rdquo; continues to be a term of
self-identification for some, for others the term is outdated and
offensive. One consequence of this is that any straightforward
definition of an expression risks eliding these changes and taking
sides on these contestations. For the reason, the terms will often be
discussed throughout the entry by placing them within their historical
and political location and then using them as appropriate to that time
and place. When more general terms are required, the contemporary
expressions &lsquo;trans,&rsquo; &lsquo;trans woman,&rsquo;
&lsquo;trans man&rsquo;, and &lsquo;nonbinary&rsquo; will be used,
recognizing that this deployment risks anachronism. The expression
&lsquo;nontrans&rsquo; will be used in place of the expression
&lsquo;cis.&rsquo;</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="WroBodAcc">1. The Wrong Body Account</h2>

<p>
The Wrong Body Account consists of two main claims. First, that trans
gender dysphoria is to be accounted for as an incongruence between
gender identity and body. Second, that gender identity is either
innate or immutable from an early age. There is also a third claim
that may or may not be endorsed &ndash; namely, that the innateness
(or immutability) of this gender identity validates trans claims to
belong to this or that gender. This last claim has tended to be voiced
by some of those trans folk who have endorsed this account (Hausman
1995, 141&ndash;174, Prosser 1998, 99&ndash;134). The voicing of it by
medical practitioners, by contrast, has been more mixed (contrast
Benjamin 1953, 13 and Hamburger <em>et al</em> 1953, 392). The general
idea, at any rate, is that, prior to transition, a trans woman is a
woman &ldquo;trapped inside&rdquo; the body of man and a trans man is
a man &ldquo;trapped inside&rdquo; the body of a woman. The solution
to this medical condition consists in the various technologies of
transition including access to surgical and hormonal
interventions.</p>

<p>
Two intertwined intellectual developments served as preconditions for
the view &ndash; namely, the field of sexology &ndash; the
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; study of human sexuality &ndash; and the
development of hormonal and surgical procedures for changing sex
characteristics. Some of the most notable thinkers in sexology include
Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1864 [1994]), Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1886
[1965]), Havelock Ellis (1905 [1942]), and Magnus Hirschfeld (1910
[1991]). The idea of being trapped in the wrong body can be traced to
Ulrichs, although it is deployed in a less contemporary way as what we
now call gender identity and sexual orientation are not distinguished.
Meanwhile, as early as the 1910s Eugen Steinach was experimenting with
&ldquo;transplantation&rdquo; on animals and by the 1920s and 1930s,
hormonal and surgical treatments were being made available to humans,
largely through Magnus Hirschfeld&rsquo;s Institute for Sexual Science
(Meyerowitz 2002, 16&ndash;21).</p>

<p>
In the United States, however, there was a reluctance to provide such
treatments owing to concerns about violations of &lsquo;mayhem&rsquo;
laws. This was ungirded by the view that trans phenomena were purely
psychological in character and ought to be treated
psychotherapeutically to &ldquo;cure the mental illness.&rdquo; By
contrast, in Europe, the prevailing view was a &ldquo;bisexuality
theory&rdquo; which maintained that there was a physical blend of male
and female in all human beings and that special cases yielded a
&ldquo;mixed-sex&rdquo; condition which in some cases justified
surgical intervention (Meyerowitz 2002, 98&ndash;129).</p>

<p>
This began to change in the early 1950s with Christine
Jorgensen&rsquo;s well-publicized transition and U.S. celebrity. In
1953, two articles were published, one by her endocrinologist in the
U.S., Harry Benjamin, another by her Danish endocrinologist, Christian
Hamburger, psychiatrist, Georg K. St&uuml;rup, and lead surgeon, E.
Dahl-Iverson. Both articles argued that the desire for medical
transformation in &ldquo;transsexualism,&rdquo; as Benjamin called it,
and &ldquo;genuine transvestism&rdquo; (&ldquo;psychic
hermaphroditism,&rdquo; &ldquo;eonism&rdquo; (as Hamburger <em>et
al</em> called it), could not be altered through psychiatric treatment
and likely had a somatic basis. Benjamin spoke of a &ldquo;female
psyche in a male body&rdquo; (1953, 12), and Hamburger <em>et al.</em>
characterized &ldquo;eonists&rdquo; as having a &ldquo;fundamental
feeling of being victims of a cruel mistake &ndash; a consequence of
the female personality in a male body&rdquo; (1953, 391). In addition
to arguing against the application of &lsquo;mayhem&rsquo; laws to
prevent access to medical procedures, they also argued against laws
prohibiting public cross dressing and in favor of legal recognition
consistent with &ldquo;psyche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In 1966, Benjamin published the landmark <em>The Transsexual
Phenomenon.</em> Meanwhile, that same year saw the opening of the
Johns Hopkins University program for sex- reassignment surgery, with
John Money as the lead, ushering in a period of large university-based
gender-identity clinics which lasted until the end of the seventies.
By the time the Johns Hopkins program closed in 1979, the Harry
Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (since renamed The
World Health Professional Association for Transgender Health or WPATH)
had been formed and had approved standardized criteria for the
treatment of transsexuals. A year later, <em>transsexualism</em> was
added to the DSM, the same year that <em>homosexuality</em> was
removed from it. (In 2000, transsexualism was replaced by gender
identity disorder in the DSM-IV and in 2013, this was replaced with
gender dysphoria in the DSM-V).</p>

<p>
Work by John Money, Joan Hampson, and John Hampson (1955) on
intersexuality, the state of having both female and male biological
characteristics, converged with the emerging view about
&ldquo;transsexualism&rdquo;. Their work purported to evade the debate
between psychology and biology, arguing that while the capacity to
learn a &ldquo;gender role&rdquo; (like a language) was biologically
grounded, the specific native role learned (like language) was
contingent upon social environment which became &ldquo;locked
down&rdquo; at a very early age (1957). Subsequently, the expression
<em>gender identity</em> was coined by Robert Stoller and Ralph
Greenson in 1964, which helped terminologically separate the notion of
social role from psychological sense-of-self. Stoller defined the
latter as &ldquo;the sense of knowing to which sex one belongs&rdquo;
(1964, 220). It was ultimately taken up by the likes of Money and
Harry Benjamin (Meyerowitz 2002, 117&ndash;9), and while debate over
etiology continued, views allowing for both biology and social
environment in determining gender identity gained somewhat greater
prominence (Meyerowitz 2002, 119).</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, feminist sociologist Ann Oakley, drawing on Stoller&rsquo;s
work, contrasted &lsquo;sex&rsquo; as a biological term and
&lsquo;gender&rsquo; as &ldquo;a psychological and cultural one&rdquo;
(2015 [1972], 115) in what was one of the earliest feminist
deployments of the term &lsquo;gender&rsquo; to characterize the
sex/gender distinction. Prior to this, expressions such as &lsquo;sex
role&rsquo; and &lsquo;sex role stereotype&rsquo; tended to be used by
feminists and many continued to use those terms long after. Indeed, as
discussed below, some feminists will come to be critical of the very
notion of gender. The issues, far from terminological, concern the
question whether the cultural phenomena designated by expressions like
&lsquo;sex role&rsquo; and &lsquo;gender&rsquo; are exhausted by their
function in subordinating women or whether they also operate in other
forms of subordination and can be repurposed in acts of
resistance.</p>

<h2 id="LesSepPer">2. The Lesbian Separatist Perspective</h2>

<p>
Lesbian Separatism is a species of radical feminism where radical
feminism itself understands women&rsquo;s oppression as arising due to
patriarchal arrangements, regards sexist domination as the fundamental
form of oppression, and which advocates a remaking of society. It is
worth noting that several radical feminist thinkers have explicitly
endorsed trans affirming feminist views, including Andrea Dworkin
(1974) and Catharine A. MacKinnon (2023). Further, Loren Cannon (2016)
argues that Shulamith Firestone&rsquo;s (1970) radical feminist vision
of the future &ndash; one in which reproduction is facilitated by
technological advancement &ndash; has begun to be actualized in trans
affirming communities and greater recognition of trans lives will
yield greater strides towards the revolution Firestone envisioned.</p>

<p>
Moreover, prior to the rise of separatism, lesbian perspectives on
trans issues were mixed. One of the earliest controversies occurred in
the San Francisco chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis in 1972 over the
participation of Beth Elliott (a transsexual woman who was serving as
vice-president) (Bettcher and Stryker 2016, 276). The side that
favored inclusion appealed to the Wrong Body Account above to argue
that transsexual women were women, while the side that supported
expulsion did not endorse a feminist perspective, such as lesbian
separatism (C&oacute;rdova 1972). Meanwhile, the Lesbian <em>Tide</em>
Collective in Los Angeles, led by Jeanne C&oacute;rdova, articulated a
third position that argued common cause in the fight against mandated
&ldquo;sex roles&rdquo; and in favor of self-definition (<em>Tide</em>
Collective, 1972) &ndash; a view that anticipated the transgender
paradigm of the nineteen-nineties (see below).</p>

<p>
These perspectives were overshadowed, however, when controversy ensued
at the 1973 West Coast Lesbian Conference in Los Angeles. As Beth
Elliott took the stage as a performer, the Gutter Dykes, a group from
San Francisco protested the presence of a &ldquo;man&rdquo; on lesbian
separatist grounds (Stryker 2017, 129&ndash;131). While the
participants ultimately voted that Elliott could continue performing,
Elliott did not stay for the remainder of the conference. The keynote,
Robin Morgan, charged Elliott, &ldquo;as an opportunist, an
infiltrator, and a destroyer &ndash; with the mentality of a
rapist&rdquo; (Morgan 1977, 181).</p>

<p>
Lesbian separatism itself arose in response to mainstream feminist
lesbophobia. In 1969&ndash;70, Betty Freidan, President of the
National Organization for Women (NOW) purged lesbian feminists from
leadership positions, concerned about &ldquo;lesbian baiting.&rdquo;
This, in turn, led to a &ldquo;zap&rdquo; at the Second Congress to
Unite Women in 1970 (Stryker 2017, 125). Led by Rita Mae Brown, the
&ldquo;lavender menace&rdquo; seized the stage while distributing the
pamphlet &ldquo;The Woman-Identified Woman&rdquo; (Radicalesbians 1970
[1988]). Against the view that concerns about prejudice against
lesbianism distracted from the mission of feminism, this document
argued that such prejudice was integral to sexism, and hence central
to feminism. The essence of sexist oppression, in this view, is the
mandated heterosexual relation with men through which women are
subordinated. The second main idea is that women are conditioned to
form self-identities that involve identification with their oppressors
and that, consequently, it is critical for women to develop new
self-identities by learning to love women and by becoming
woman-identified, breaking away from relationships with men.</p>

<p>
The lesbian separatist position (as well as any radical feminist
position recommending the undoing of socialization under patriarchy)
<em>prima facie</em> conflicts with the Wrong Body Account discussed
above at least insofar as the latter regards gender identity as fixed
from an early age, the former endorses the project of changing
one&rsquo;s identity from man- to woman-identified later in life,
suggesting the mutability of gender identity. In other words, the
latter treats as fixed certain identities that can be rightfully
critiqued from a feminist perspective. However, one might argue, as
did Beth Elliott, that there is a distinction between gender identity
as the sense of knowing to which sex one belongs (as per Stoller and
Greenson), and the internalization of sex stereotypes. It is the
latter, she says, not the former that is required to be mutable
(Elliott 1973).</p>

<p>
Janice Raymond&rsquo;s <em>The Transsexual Empire</em> (1979) is the
most systematic development of the lesbian separatist perspective on
transsexuality. She regards medicalization of gender variance and the
gender identity clinics as nothing but vehicles to further secure
sexist sex roles. Thus, for her, a sexist society is &ldquo;the first
cause&rdquo; of transsexuality (1979, 16). The role of the medical
treatment of transsexuality is to turn men into &ldquo;women&rdquo;
and women into &ldquo;men&rdquo; when they cannot be normed into their
natally assigned sex roles. Raymond&rsquo;s solution to &ldquo;the
problem&rdquo; of transsexuality which she sees as promoting the
surgical violation of bodily integrity, is to &ldquo;morally mandate
it out of existence&rdquo; (178) by working against sex role
oppression through education and consciousness raising
(178&ndash;185).</p>

<p>
For Raymond, the phrase <em>transsexual empire</em> applies to the
patriarchal medical establishment which perpetuates sex-role
oppression through surgical intervention. (She uses the word
<em>empire</em> to refer to &ldquo;a political unit having a territory
of great extent, or a number of territories under a single sovereign
authority&rdquo; (xv). She sees the medical &ldquo;empire&rdquo; as
including numerous specialties such as urology, gynecology,
endocrinology, and so forth. She also sees the collaboration of
psychology and psychiatry in hiding what she calls the sovereignty of
the medical &ldquo;empire&rdquo; by making it appear that there is
some need for transsexual medical intervention, as well as the
involvement of lawyers and legislators. However, it is the medical
establishment, for Raymond, which possesses this sovereignty. So, it
is the medical establishment which is the unifying authority of the
&ldquo;transsexual empire&rdquo; (ibid.)).</p>

<p>
Raymond rejects trans self-identifying claims by asserting that
membership in the category <em>woman</em> is determined by (1)
chromosomes and (2) the individual&rsquo;s history of experience being
assigned to a sex role (1979, 4, 18, 114). In light of this, Raymond
maintains that transsexual women are men and transsexual men are
women. One worry with her view is that the two criteria can come
apart. For instance, individuals born with Complete Androgen
Insensitivity Syndrome have XY chromosomes yet will typically
experience female socialization because their external morphology is
female. A possible solution, endorsed by Germaine Greer, is that such
individuals is to commit to the first criterion alone (1999,
74&ndash;79). However, such a position runs against the actual
experiences of the individuals involved &ndash; living as women
&ndash; as well as the spirit of lesbian separatism itself. In the
first edition of <em>Empire</em>, Raymond, by contrast, admits that
somebody without XX chromosomes yet with the history of being raised
as a woman would be &ldquo;practically a woman&rdquo; (1979, 115),
although she later reframes this history in terms of bodily events
likely to occur to somebody with XX chromosomes (e.g., menstruation,
childbirth) (Raymond 1994, xx).</p>

<p>
The argument behind the second criterion centers on the idea that
&lsquo;woman&rsquo; (or &lsquo;womon&rsquo;) is a term being
reclaiming in the face of sexist oppression. For somebody who has not
experienced that oppression to self-identify with the term would be
both appropriative and semantically empty, analogous to a white person
claiming to be black (Raymond 1979, 116). While this argument has
force, there are two possible responses. First, many trans women
certainly do experience sexist oppression after they transition and
not a few trans women transition fairly young. At some point, a
reclamation of the term would seem viable (Bettcher 2017a, 402).
Second, the term &lsquo;woman&rsquo; can be used in multiply
oppressive ways. For instance, it can be used as an instrument of
racism by centralizing white norms of femininity (e.g., fragility), or
as an instrument of homophobia by centralizing heterosexist norms of
femininity. This suggests that the term can be reclaimed along
multiple vectors of oppression and to the extent that there exists a
distinct form of trans oppression &ndash; Bettcher suggests
&ldquo;reality enforcement&rdquo; and the centralization of genitalia
&ndash;the term could be reclaimed on that basis alone (Bettcher
2017a, 402, see below for further discussion of &ldquo;reality
enforcement&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Crucial to Raymond&rsquo;s position, however, is the view that any
sort of oppression that trans people face is the side effect of sexist
oppression &ndash; that is, is a form of collateral damage. This view
leads Raymond to ignore trans-specific forms of oppression and
resistance. The actual struggle of some scientists and surgeons to
make surgeries available to transsexuals, for instance, is ignored in
Raymond&rsquo;s account (Riddell 2006). Such advocates for transsexual
surgery were in the minority (certainly in the U.S) and themselves
experienced hostility and marginalization. This means that what
Raymond calls the transsexual empire was not monolithic. And given the
<em>marginalization</em> of these advocates for transsexual surgery,
it seems that the medical establishment was not especially friendly to
transsexuality (Riddell 2006). Generally, transsexuality was and
remains largely unaccepted in society. Contrary to Raymond&rsquo;s
view, it is largely <em>not</em> endorsed by &ldquo;the
patriarchy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Raymond herself engages in oppressive behavior towards
trans people by constructing monolithic, stereotypical representations
of trans individuals in ways that foreclose the possibility of
registering the actual variable experiences of trans people (on this
point see Riddell 2006, 152&ndash;3, Stone 1991, 298, Heyes 2003,
1095). Most egregiously, she writes, &ldquo;All transsexuals rape
women&rsquo;s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact,
appropriating this body for themselves. However, the transsexually
constructed lesbian-feminist violates women&rsquo;s sexuality and
spirit, as well. Rape, although it is usually done by force, can also
be accomplished by deception&rdquo; (104).</p>

<p>
She points to ways in which (some) transsexual women take up
traditional sex roles (and are thereby complicit) on the one hand
(77&ndash;79), and yet goes on to criticize lesbian-separatist
identified transsexual women who have eschewed such roles as
oppressively masculine (102&ndash;6). In this way, she traps
transsexual women with a double-bind: Either they take up traditional
sex roles and are thereby sexist or else they eschew these traditional
sex roles and are thereby sexist (See Califia 1997, 102, 104&ndash;5;
Serano 2007, 49). Such a theory isn&rsquo;t equipped to accommodate
the actual variable experiences of transsexual women trying to
negotiate gender in a sexist and transphobic world. In this way,
Raymond&rsquo;s theory erases the actual experiences of transsexual
women through monolithic, ideologically-driven representations of
them. Moreover, because Raymond sees transsexuality as essentially a
&ldquo;male&rdquo; phenomenon, her discussion of transsexual men is
minimal. She argues that transsexual men are mere tokens who are used
to prop up claims that transsexuality is a universal phenomenon and
thereby hide its true patriarchal character. In this way, their
transsexuality is largely dropped out of the picture (xxiii,
27&ndash;28, 140; for further critique see Califia 1997, 100&ndash;1,
Serano 2007, 48). This allows her to avoid discussing transsexual men
in any depth at all. And this means that the complex, variable,
everyday experiences of transsexual men do not get represented in the
first place.</p>

<h2 id="BeyBinAcc">3. The Beyond the Binary Account</h2>

<p>
In the late 1980&rsquo;s and early 1990&rsquo;s, a new framework for
understanding trans experience emerged in reaction to the Wrong Body
Account and, in particular, to the pathologization of transsexuality,
and to anti-trans feminist perspectives such as lesbian separatism
&ndash; namely, the beyond the binary account. It consisted of the
following three claims: First, there exists a form of gender-based
oppression, usually targeting trans people, intersex people, and other
gender variant people that is distinct from sexist oppression. Second,
trans people, intersex people, and gender variant people are
problematically situated with respect to the <em>gender binary</em>.
(The binary applies to the man/woman, male/female, masculine/feminine,
and the alignment of the preceding). Third, those who are so oppressed
ought to become visible to contest the presumption of gender binarism.
In this view, it is not the body that is wrong, but, rather, the
oppressive culture.</p>

<p>
This moment witnessed the popularization of the word
&ldquo;transgender&rdquo; as a broad umbrella term &ndash; bringing
together different &ldquo;gender variant&rdquo; people (including
transsexuals, cross-dressers, drag queens and kings, some butches, and
others). Originally, the term &ldquo;transgenderist&rdquo; had been
used by Virginia Prince to refer to somebody who &ldquo;lived full
time&rdquo; in their preferred gender without availing themselves of
any medical interventions (Stryker 2017, 154). But this expansion of
the term aimed for unity in the face of hostility toward those who
were gender &ldquo;non-normative&rdquo;, those who transgress the
binary.</p>

<p>
The account itself encompasses many variations since the notion of a
strict binary may be contested in several respects including its
insistence on exclusiveness, exhaustiveness, invariance, and the
alignment of male/man/masculine and female/woman/feminine. Further,
the very categories themselves or any categories whatever may be
contested as politically controlling. For instance, while Leslie
Feinberg (1992, 1993, 1996, 1998) emphasizes the historical
persistence of transgender people as a distinct kind of people or
oppressed group, Kate Bornstein (1994) emphasizes the constructed (and
oppressive) nature of gender categories as a whole, the desirability
of viewing gender as fashion, and the importance of moving toward a
more consensual gender system.</p>

<p>
Two major theoretical views form the basis of this paradigm, each
having had a profound impact on gender scholarship. First, Sandy
Stone&rsquo;s &ldquo;The <em>Empire</em> Strikes Back: A
Posttransexual Manifesto&rdquo; launched the inter- and
multi-disciplinary field of trans studies. Second, Judith
Butler&rsquo;s <em>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of
Identity</em> (1990) trailblazed early queer theory. These are
discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="EmpStrBac">3.1 The <em>Empire</em> Strikes Back</h3>

<p>
In 1977 a controversy erupted in lesbian-separatist circles, led by
Raymond, over Sandy Stone, an openly transsexual woman and an engineer
who had been working at Olivia Records (an all-woman recording
company). Both she and Olivia were then explicitly targeted by Raymond
in <em>The Transsexual Empire.</em> After leaving Olivia, Stone earned
her doctorate under Donna Haraway at Santa Cruz, and in 1991 published
a reply to Raymond and what would become the founding essay in
transgender studies, &ldquo;The <em>Empire</em> Strikes Back: A
(post)transsexual manifesto&rdquo; (Stryker 2017, 115).</p>

<p>
Stone takes up a third position in opposition to both the medicalized
view of transsexuality characterized by Benjamin&rsquo;s <em>The
Transsexual Phenomenon</em> and the feminist critique offered in
Raymond&rsquo;s <em>The Transsexual Empire</em>. The fundamental move
of the essay is to see transsexuals as a kind of &ldquo;oppressed
minority.&rdquo; While Stone does not position transsexuals as a third
gender, she does propose that transsexuals &ldquo;currently occupy a
position which is nowhere, which is outside the binary oppositions of
gendered discourse&rdquo; (1991, 295). Because Stone wishes to avoid
appeal to a pre-existing class of individuals who are then oppressed,
she represents transsexuality as a <em>genre</em> of discourse. The
idea is that traditional medical discourse about transsexuality
constitutes a distinctive, regulated <em>way</em> of talking and
theorizing which Stone calls a <em>genre</em>. (Contrast, for example,
traditional medical discourse on transsexuality with Raymond&rsquo;s
feminist discourse on transsexuality). Stone is suspicious of
appealing to a group of individuals <em>prior</em> to the workings of
a particular discourse (that is, one which is conceived of as
independent of a particular discourse) since, goes the postmodern
worry, such an appeal to this group of individuals would nonetheless
be at the same time providing an account of them <em>within</em> a
discourse &ndash; a discourse which could be shaped by ideological
commitments. Instead of trying to make such a move, then, Stone
identifies a group of individuals as represented through traditional
medical discourse about transsexuality.</p>

<p>
Drawing on the autobiographies of some transsexual women, Stone finds
herself in agreement with Raymond in worrying about what she sees as
the uptake of sexist stereotypes by (some) transsexual women (1991,
289). However, she <em>also</em> notes (some) transsexual
women&rsquo;s insistence upon a male/female binary and the absence of
any middle or more complex gender ground (286). Beyond this, she
criticizes the subjectivity-erasing, blanket claims in Raymond&rsquo;s
work along with the implicit denial of transsexual subjectivity
discussed above (298). What is lacking, according to Stone, is space
for the discourse of transsexuals <em>as</em> transsexuals. She points
to ways in which the medicalization of transsexuality has required
both the uptake of sexist behavior <em>as well as</em> the
acquiescence to a strict gender binary. In this way, she argues,
transsexuals have been complicit in telling a story within a genre
that does not necessarily reflect their own subjective experiences
(1991, 295). At the same time, argues Stone, transsexuals have also
developed their own subcultures as well as distinctive practices
within those subcultures that entirely run against the official
account of transsexuality (such as helping each other know what to say
and how to act in order to get medically designated as a transsexual)
(291&ndash;2). The solution, Stone argues, is for transsexuals to
begin telling their own stories (295). This requires minimally, that
post-operative transsexuals come out as transsexual and forego passing
as (non-transsexual) men and women (298&ndash;9). The traditional
medical requirement that one construct a plausible non-trans history
to hide one&rsquo;s past, for Stone, undermines the possibility of
authentic relationships. Because the injunction to forego passing as
the (non-transsexual) sex one has transitioned into runs entirely
against the prevalent discourse of transsexuality <em>as such</em>,
Stone represents the political move as <em>post</em>-transsexual
(299). She sees that while many transsexuals are complicit in this
discourse, they nonetheless <em>go beyond</em> it by attempting, for
example, to assist each other in &ldquo;working&rdquo; the medical
regulations (as explained above). Thus their experiences and actions
<em>outstrip</em> the &ldquo;official&rdquo; medical accounts of
transsexuality. Yet this &ldquo;outstripping&rdquo; is rendered
invisible in any complicit attempt to fit into a medical account which
requires that one&rsquo;s status as transsexual be ultimately denied
in everyday life (through this construction of a false history). For
Stone, eschewing this discourse is important because it hides the
complex, variable experiences of different trans people who are often
positioned in contestatory ways vis a vis this discourse. The move is
not designed to find some one authentic and uniform account of
transsexuals beyond the medical discourse. It is, rather, to clear the
way for discourses from which it is at least possible to speak and to
speak politically <em>as</em> a transsexual.</p>

<p>
One crucial difference between Raymond&rsquo;s and Stone&rsquo;s views
about gender (or sex roles) turns on the former&rsquo;s contrast
between <em>integration</em> and <em>integrity. Integration</em>, for
Raymond, involves putting together parts to form a complex whole
(1979, 163). She sees androgyny as a kind of blend between masculine
and feminine and she argues that transsexual surgery also brings about
such blends (constructing the individual into a kind of hermaphroditic
being) (1979, 165). By contrast, <em>integrity</em> involves a prior
wholeness from which no part can be taken away (193). For Raymond,
true liberation cannot be secured by any mere blending of sex roles.
Rather, it must be secured through a <em>transcendence</em> of sex
role altogether (164). Stone, however, doubts the promise of purity
and instead celebrates gender mixture, drawing on Donna
Haraway&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Cyborg Manifesto&rdquo; (1983, 1991) and
Gloria Anzald&uacute;a&rsquo;s theory of the mestiza (1987).</p>

<p>
Haraway&rsquo;s postmodern image of the cyborg is intended to raise
worries, derived largely from writings of women of color, about
single, monolithic (identity-based) accounts of oppression/liberation.
According to Haraway, the difficulty with such theories is that they
are partial in their account of the world (while assuming
universality) and so end up ignoring (and even promoting) certain
forms of oppression (1991 [1983], 156). The cyborg, then, is a
collection of disparate, incongruent parts: Each individual contains
multiple elements of oppressor and oppressed. As a metaphor, it is
intended to refuse postulations of original innocence and utopian
future (1991 [1983], 151). Instead, resistance for Haraway is possible
due only to the possibility of the cyborg&rsquo;s turning against the
intentions of its maker in a dystopian environment (151).</p>

<p>
This notion of mixture is also central in the work of Anzald&uacute;a,
who speaks against an emphasis on purity and in favor of the notion of
mixed race (<em>una</em> <em>raza mestiza</em>) (1987, 99). She
recognizes herself as a border dweller, torn between the demands of
conflicting cultures (for example, anglo and Mexican) (1987, 100). The
experience of being caught in the confluence of multiple cultures
leads to a kind of multiplicity or fragmentation of self. For example,
one might be represented in a racist manner in dominant white forms of
feminism and in a sexist manner in dominant forms of racial
resistance. This tension between conflicting cultural perspectives
yields the possibility of &ldquo;double&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Mestiza&rdquo; consciousness which involves the capacity to see
oneself in accordance with the dominant ways in which one is
oppressively represented and constrained in different, and often
conflicting ways (101&ndash;2). It is precisely the capacity to be
conscious of this plurality of the self, in Anzald&uacute;a&rsquo;s
view, that allows for resistance, since there is an awareness which
outstrips the multiple forms of oppression by viewing them together,
as well as in conflict (1987, 102). Such a consciousness also allows
for the possibility of &ldquo;linguistic terrorism&rdquo; &ndash; the
creative blending of disparate languages and cultures in ways that
work against the monolithic character of each (1987, 75&ndash;86).</p>

<h3 id="GenTro">3.2 Gender Trouble</h3>

<p>
The political landscape began to change during the late nineteen
eighties and early nineteen nineties as the HIV/AIDS pandemic was
devasting gay male communities in the U.S. and the horrors of
homophobia were on vivid display. Many lesbians began to work closely
with gay men and the new issue-driven activism of ACT-UP overshadowed
earlier identity-based politics. Judith Butler&rsquo;s seminal work
emerged out of this context.</p>

<p>
Aside from arguing against the identity-based politics on the grounds
that identity categories were inherently normative and exclusionary,
Butler aimed to answer concerns that queer enactments of gender (as in
a butch-femme relationship or in gay male drag) merely replicate
traditional patriarchal norms. Certainly, lesbian separatist views
such as Raymond&rsquo;s had led to the purging of butch and femme
forms of gender presentation in feminist communities.</p>

<p>
For Butler, such a view presupposes a heterosexual bias obscuring the
way in which gender is re-worked in queer contexts. What they have in
mind is that in queer subculture gender practices do not always have
the same meaning that they do in mainstream cultural contexts. For
example, feminine presentation in some queer contexts may involve a
degree of irony not found in mainstream instances of that feminine
presentation. To treat queer gender practices as simply repeating or
miming non-queer practices without any significant change in meaning
is to understand all gender practices in a way that assigns dominant
heterosexual meanings to it.</p>

<p>
Queer gender performance, far from replicating patriarchal norms, can
subvert such norms by exposing their non-natural, imitative character
(1990, 174&ndash;80). Sometimes queer gender performance can involve
irony and/or parody through exaggeration. (Good examples of this can
be found in early films by John Waters, such as <em>Female
Trouble</em>). Queer gender can make fun of heterosexual gender
practices by exaggerating them and parodying them in such ways that
make them seem theatrical and contrived. And gay male drag, for
Butler, can show that feminine presentation is not the sole property
of female individuals. Once it is recognized that such behavior is
only contingently assigned to groups of individuals, the very idea
that gay drag merely involves imitation of heterosexual women as the
original assigns a priority to the latter over the former. This
prioritization, for Butler, reflects a heterosexual bias. And, so for
Butler, feminist identification of <em>all</em> gendered behavior as
<em>inherently</em> sexist (as, for example, found in Raymond&rsquo;s
work) is nothing short of a heterosexist tendency to attach a primacy
to heterosexual gender performance.</p>

<p>
Butler&rsquo;s account of gender aims to call into question the
pre-existence of a group of individuals (i.e., women, females) prior
to the enforcement of gender role. Instead, in Butler&rsquo;s view,
biological sex is culturally instituted and in this sense
&ldquo;gender all along.&rdquo; Prima facie this view seems
counter-intuitive. However, in Butler&rsquo;s view, whenever we
discuss the body, we are also always representing it in culturally
specific and normative ways. To speak of the biologically sexed body
as somehow prior to particular discourses about it is to, in so doing,
nonetheless ironically speak about it <em>within some particular
discourse</em> and hence to represent in some way. According to
Butler, sex is culturally instituted by representing the body as the
<em>natural container</em> of some inner, gendered self. Sex is
understood as the bodily indication that concealed within it is the
essence of either a woman or a man. For Butler, this view is false. To
the extent that this view is pervasive and regulative of human
conduct, one can &ndash; in this sense &ndash; say that sex is
socially constructed.</p>

<p>
For Butler, behavioral manifestations of gender are often taken to
express a prior gender identity that is contained within a naturally
sexed body. Thus, feminine behavior is seen as expressive of an inner
feminine core (contained within the body sexed female). On the
contrary, in their view, such performances simply serve to generate
the fiction of a pre-existing gender identity as well as the fiction
of the sexed body qua natural container of this identity (1990,
178&ndash;9). This is to say: Behavioral manifestations are prior to
gender identity and sexed body (rather than the other way around). The
illusion of a stably sexed body, core gender identity, and (hetero)
sexual orientation is perpetuated through repeated, stylized bodily
performances that are <em>performative</em> in the sense that they are
productive of the fiction of a stable identity, orientation, and sexed
body as prior to the gendered behavior (173).</p>

<p>
This allows Butler to answer the charge that queer gender performances
merely replicate sexist gender role behavior. In their view,
<em>all</em> gender behavior is imitative in character. Heterosexual
gender identity involves an instability that it attempts to cover
over: While it purports to be grounded in a naturally gendered core,
it amounts to nothing more than repeated attempts to imitate past
instances of gendered behavior (1990, 185). Thus, there is also a
subversive potential of queer drag and camp gender performance, in her
view, insofar as it can parody and thereby <em>expose</em> this
concealed imitative quality (1990, 174&ndash;6). As a consequence,
Butler welcomes the proliferation of queer gender behaviors that
re-signify, parody, and expose the mechanisms by which the fiction of
normative heterosexist gender is created (1990, 184&ndash;190).</p>

<h3 id="BeyBin20">3.3 Beyond the Binary 2.0</h3>

<p>
Despite the ascendance of the Beyond the Binary Model, there were
trans scholars, such as Viviane Namaste (2000, 2005, 2009), Jay
Prosser (1998), and Henry Rubin (1998a, 2003), who worried that the
paradigm didn&rsquo;t accurately capture the realities of transsexual
people and, in particular, didn&rsquo;t leave much space for trans
people who didn&rsquo;t self-identity as &ldquo;beyond the
binary&rdquo; at all (Namaste 2005, 7). These critiques were connected
to several other concerns &ndash; both theoretical and political. The
work of Jay Prosser (1998, 69) attempted to rehabilitate the Wrong
Body Account in a way that could enter into a dialogue with
Butler&rsquo;s views (1990, 1993). Politically, there was concern with
a transgender politics of visibility and, moreover it&rsquo;s
affiliation with a queer politic (Rubin 1998a, 276).</p>

<p>
The backlash did not merely occur in the theory books. For example, in
the United States, various forms of transsexual separatism, were
voiced mostly on online social networking sites and blogs. In this
type of political view, transsexuals particularly those who have
undergone genital reconstruction and who choose not to disclose their
trans history, see themselves as non-consensually subsumed under the
&lsquo;transgender umbrella&rsquo; and wrongly associated with gender
non-normative people (such as cross-dressers) (Cooke 2007). While the
transgender umbrella was supposed to include transsexuals, there were
those transsexuals who had nothing but distain for the term which they
saw as coopting them into a political vision that was not their own.
In disavowing the term, they were disavowing a politics.</p>

<p>
By 2011, at least, some had started to discuss the &ldquo;death&rdquo;
of the &ldquo;transgender umbrella&rdquo; due, in part, to these
tensions and due also to the emergence of many youth who were
self-identifying as &lsquo;nonbinary,&rsquo;
&lsquo;genderqueer,&rsquo; &lsquo;agender,&rsquo; and so forth (Allen
2011). The ideas that circulated in the nineties had now become lived
possibilities for young people who were increasingly attracted to
identities that opposed the traditional ones. Around this time, a new
umbrella term &ndash; &lsquo;trans*&rsquo; &ndash; emerged, motivated
by the erasure of nonbinary people from transgender politics (Bussell
2012). While &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; had been deployed as an
umbrella term for those &ldquo;beyond the binary,&rdquo; the dominance
of self-identified transgender men and women who do political work
under the category &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; had seemed to require a
new iteration of the beyond the binary vision (although, this time,
rather than drag queens and kings, cross dressers, and butches, it was
nonbinary-, agender-, gender fluid-, and genderqueer-identified
individuals who contested the binary).</p>

<p>
Julia Serano&rsquo;s ground-breaking 2007 book, <em>Whipping
Girl</em>, played an important role in this changing landscape by
mitigating the tensions (above) by attempting to bring the Wrong Body
Account and the Beyond the Binary Account into harmony. By appealing
to the notion of an innate <em>subconscious</em> sex, Serano helps
move past the requirement that one &ldquo;always knew&rdquo;
one&rsquo;s internal sex or gender (78&ndash;82). And by recognizing
wide variations in nature, she helps obviate concerns about the
pathologizing nature of the Wrong Body Account. By postulating innate
inclinations to express one&rsquo;s gender in a wide variety of ways,
Serano can say that the insistence on male/masculine and
female/feminine binaries was too sharp while also claiming that
masculinity may naturally clump towards male, femininity towards
female.</p>

<p>
Under Serano&rsquo;s influence, a queer &ldquo;smash the binary&rdquo;
politic is replaced by one centered on privilege &ndash; the privilege
of non-trans, or, as they were now named &ldquo;cis&rdquo; people.
Serano deploys the term <em>cissexualism</em> to indicate the
advantaging of those for whom biological sex and subconscious sex are
in alignment. The term <em>cisgenderism</em>, by contrast, indicates
the assumption that males ought to be masculine and females ought to
be feminine (where masculinity and femininity are constituted by the
set of attributes typically associated with males and females
respectively) (90).</p>

<p>
Serano proposes &ldquo;oppositional sexism&rdquo; as a vector distinct
from what she calls &ldquo;traditional sexism.&rdquo; She defines the
latter as the belief that males and masculinity are superior to
females and femininity and the former as the belief that male and
female, along with masculinity and femininity, constitute exclusive
categories) (2007, 12&ndash;3) and she coins the expression
<em>trans-misogyny</em> to capture forms of discrimination which
pertain specifically to trans women which principally target their
perceived femininity who effectively lie at the intersections of these
vectors (13).</p>

<p>
One concern with this model, however, is that traditional sexism
already seems to involve not only the devaluation of femininity, but
also its enforcement as exemplified by the numerous double-binds to
which women are subjected (Frye 1983). That is, Serano&rsquo;s
distinction of the two vectors yields an account of &ldquo;traditional
sexism&rdquo; that is too meagre (Bettcher 2021). Another concern is
that, for Serano, while some forms of femininity may be socially
instituted, many feminine attributes may also be biologically grounded
(2007, 339). In Serano&rsquo;s view, many (nontrans) feminists have
engaged in negative assessments of femininity (viewing it as strictly
an imposed artifice) and thereby implicated themselves in a form of
sexism. Indeed, Serano claims that any feminist critique of trans
femininity is inherently anti-feminist (2007, 360). The worry is that
Serano under-estimates the degree and depth of female subordination.
While she may be right to raise worries about the ways in which the
behavior of trans women has been unfairly judged, a position which
allows for no analysis of politically problematic gender behavior at
all seems to seriously impair feminism&rsquo;s critical force.</p>

<h3 id="Tra">3.4 Transfeminism</h3>

<p>
The Combahee River Collective&rsquo;s <em>Black Feminist
Statement</em> (1977 [1981]) constitutes one of the earliest
rejections of lesbian separatism. Arguing for the unacceptability of
abandoning their black men in the struggle against racism, the
collective articulates the basic idea of what Kimberl&eacute; Crenshaw
will later call &lsquo;intersectionality&rsquo; (1989). In additional
to being oppressed due to racism and sexism, argues the collective,
black women experience forms of intermeshed forms of oppression that
cannot be separated into discrete vectors. For instance, they write of
&ldquo;racial-sexual oppression, which is neither solely racial nor
solely sexual, e.g., the history of rape of Black women by white men
as a weapon of political repression.&rdquo; Further, black women
experience forms marginalization when feminist movements are
controlled by white women and black liberation movements are
controlled by black men. Instead, the collective insists upon an
integrated analysis of racism, sexism, classism, and heterosexism.</p>

<p>
Drawing on this idea, Emi Koyama regards characterizes trans feminism
as &ldquo;primarily a movement by and for trans women who view their
liberation to be intrinsically linked to the liberation of all women
and beyond&rdquo; (2003, 244). In this view, trans oppression
intersects with sexism oppression and other forms of oppression such
as racist and classist forms of oppression. Through this
intersectional transfeminist lens, Koyama discusses the controversy
concerning the Michigan Womyn&rsquo;s Music Festival and the
&lsquo;womyn-born womyn&rsquo; policy which excluded trans women. (In
1991, the same year Stone published her manifesto, Nancy Jean
Burkholder was denied entrance to the Land at Michigan Womyn&rsquo;s
Music Festival, leading to protests the following year and the
formation of Camp Trans in 1994.)</p>

<p>
Specifically, Koyama criticizes the efforts of some post-operative
trans women to accept a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; policy which would
have admitted only post-operative trans women. Such a policy, argues
Koyama, would unfairly advantage those trans women with greater
economic resources, and is consequently both classist and racist
(2006, 700). Koyama also argues that even if it is true that non-trans
women require their own space, this does not preclude the admission of
trans women into the festival, since while women of color have special
exclusionary space on the land, this does not require that white women
cannot enter the festival at all (701). Moreover, Koyama points out,
such special space for women of color does not exclude those women of
color who can pass as white (and thereby receive certain privileges)
(701). Indeed, Koyama argues, the exclusion of trans women is
inherently racist insofar as it is uses differences in experience to
rule out trans women, a policy which can only make sense if it is
presupposed that feminist solidarity requires a monolithically shared
experience (704).</p>

<p>
Cameron Awkward-Rich (2017, 836&ndash;7), however, points to the way
the experiences of trans men and trans masculine people more generally
challenge the notion that the purview of feminism is determined by the
category woman. Trans men and trans masculine people can be subject to
sexist oppression and attempts at socialization as girl as children
and, further, can be subject to sexist violence even after transition.
Since they can be subject to sexism, they ought to be subjects of
feminist concern, despite the fact that they are not women. Observing
that while both Stone&rsquo;s and Koyama&rsquo;s manifesto promise a
sequel centralizing trans men, none have ever been forthcoming,
Awkward-Rich suggests that Koyama&rsquo;s model merely replicates
traditional intersectional forms of feminism while obscuring the
deeper challenges posed by trans men and masculine individuals to
traditional conceptions of feminism. (For related discussion see Hale
1998b, Rubin 1998b, Salamon 2010.)</p>

<h2 id="EarDisPer">4. Early Disciplinary Perspectives</h2>

<p>
C. Jacob Hale&rsquo;s work in the late nineteen-nineties is among the
earliest instances of disciplinary trans philosophy and, reflective of
the time, articulates a largely beyond-the-binary conception of trans
experience. Hale defends the view that the category <em>woman</em> is
what Wittgenstein called a family-resemblance concept. This position
enables Hale to then argue, pace Monique Wittig&rsquo;s contentious
claim that lesbians are not women (1992), that some lesbians are
women, others are not, and for some there is no fact of the matter
(1996, 115). Similarly, Hale argues, there is no single feature which
can distinguish between butch and ftm individuals and that both
categories are family-resemblance concepts (1998a, 323). If so, claims
Hale, it would be better to speak of a border zone where the
categories partially overlap with each other than to search for a firm
boundary between the two (323).</p>

<p>
Drawing on Mar&iacute;a Lugones&rsquo;s notion of
&lsquo;world&rsquo;-travelling (Lugones 1987), Hale speaks of
&ldquo;border zone dwellers&rdquo; &ndash; individuals who live at the
edges of multiple, overlapping identity categories. For Hale, border
zone dwellers, those who occupy &lsquo;dislocated locations,&rsquo;
may fit within different categories (&lsquo;man&rsquo;,
&lsquo;ftm&rsquo;, &lsquo;butch&rsquo;, &lsquo;genderqueer&rsquo;
etc.) that attach to different cultural &lsquo;worlds&rsquo; (1998b,
116&ndash;7). However, since these border zone dwellers are marginal
with respect to the categories, their fit in all cases will be only
limited and tenuous. (Hale thereby modifies Lugones&rsquo; conception
of &lsquo;world&rsquo;-travel, which does not postulate such a tenuous
fit into categories, instead, emphasizing the multiplicity of
languages and systems of meaning (117)).</p>

<p>
In one of the earliest pro-trans feminist discussions, Naomi Scheman
(1997) proceeds with the assumption that marginal lives &ldquo;are
lived, and hence livable&rdquo; (132). She considers the
unintelligibility of her own secular Judaism under Christianormativity
insofar as a Jewish people conceptually required by
Christianormativity, and yet rendered unintelligible by its
representation of all religions as entirely conversion-based (1997,
128). By contrast, she argues, heteronormativity requires a
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; binary of women and men, transsexuals are
paradoxically defined by an insistence of having always been the other
sex all along and thereby required to deny their own histories
(138&ndash;9). Just as individuals may convert to Judaism, Scheman
suggests, transsexual women may be understood to &ldquo;convert&rdquo;
to womanhood. In both cases, such individuals are no less real than
those who have been assigned the categories at birth (144). (While she
recognizes that transsexuals do not choose their gender, as one might
choose to convert to a religion, she also suggests that by viewing
sex/gender as more analogous to Jewishness in this respect, some of
its oppressiveness might be undermined (145)). Such converts, Scheman
explains, count every bit as much as women as those who have been
&ldquo;perinatally pinked&rdquo; &ndash; that is those who have
experienced oppression as female from birth (141&ndash;2).</p>

<p>
Cressida Heyes continues this project of finding grounds for
solidarity. Heyes argues that both Raymond (and Bernice Hausman, not
discussed in this entry) are caught in the grip of a picture which
precludes any examination of their own gender privilege while
foreclosing the possibility of perceiving trans resistance (2003,
1095). This foreclosure is accomplished through assimilating all
transsexual subjectivity into to a hetero-patriarchal medical
discourse about transsexuality (2003, 1095). Using Feinberg&rsquo;s
book <em>Trans Liberation</em> as an example, Heyes also raises
worries about a transgender politics which says that individual gender
expression ought not be subject to criticism, restriction, or
oppression. She observes that gender is not merely an aesthetic style
or expression of an isolated self. It is relational and often embedded
in problematic systems of oppression. What is missing from accounts
which merely tout gender freedom of expression, Heyes argues, is a
rich &ldquo;ethics of transformation&rdquo; which distinguishes
between progressive transformations from those who are oppressed and
marginalized and hegemonic (i.e., dominant; oppressive) forms of
gender that only further oppression and marginalization (2003,
1111&ndash;3). In this way, she seeks to find some middle, common
ground.</p>

<h2 id="FemPhiPur">5. The Feminist Philosophical Purview</h2>

<p>
The late 1990&rsquo;sand early 2000&rsquo;s saw several feminist
philosophers responding to the challenges of Butlerian queer theory
and the upshots of intersectionality &ndash; both of which appear to
undermine the view that the purview of feminism can be set by the
concept of woman. The former regards the concept as serving a regular
function that performs various exclusions. The latter (&ldquo;the
problem of difference&rdquo;) suggests that there is no unifying
category at all. On the supposition that &lsquo;woman&rsquo; does not
mean &lsquo;adult, female human&rsquo; but rather something social,
(since this that would appear to go against the feminist insight that
womanhood is not a fact of biology, but, rather, a fact of culture),
there do not appear to be any features all women have in common. This
is because all social features such as status, role, and so forth, are
inflected by racial privilege and oppression (as has already been
exemplified by the failures of lesbian separatism to address racial
oppression). Initial responses did not centralize or, in some cases,
even include the question of trans inclusion. This changed in the two
thousand teens.</p>

<h3 id="IniRes">5.1 Initial Responses</h3>

<p>
In Nathalie Stoljar&rsquo;s view (1995) the problem of difference can
be solved by endorsing a family-resemblance analysis concept of woman.
She also endorses resemblance nominalism &ndash; the view that tokens
constitute a type by participating in a resemblance structure, and she
says that the concept woman applies to that type. Stoljar says that
the type is constituted through several exemplars and that an
individual&rsquo;s membership in the type is determined by
sufficiently resembling some exemplar. Notably, Stoljar suggests that
at least some trans women might count as exemplary, while also
suggesting that others will be &ldquo;hard cases.&rdquo; (While she
does not state this, this also means that some trans men will be
&ldquo;hard cases&rdquo;). In this way, her account might be described
as <em>partially</em> trans-exclusionary.</p>

<p>
Sally Haslanger (2000 [2012]), by contrast, proposes an ameliorative
account. Rather than providing a description or analysis of the
existing concept of woman, she asks what concept feminists <em>ought
to</em> use in light of <em>their goals</em> of ending sexist
oppression. In doing so, she advocates a revisionary way of using
&lsquo;woman,&rsquo; for feminist philosophers, that ostensibly
departs from the ordinary way of speaking. In Haslanger&rsquo;s view,
woman ought to be defined in terms of subordination. Specifically, she
proposes that one <em>functions</em> as a woman in some context just
in case one is subordinated on the basis of presumed female sex (i.e.
female biological role in reproduction) in that context (235). And she
says that one is a woman just in case one typically (&ldquo;regularly,
and for the most part&rdquo;) functions as woman (234). Notably, this
leads to the exclusion of trans women who are presumed biologically
male and the inclusion of trans men who are presumed biologically
female. (Haslanger&rsquo;s view would prove to be tremendously
generative, particularly in teens and twenties).</p>

<p>
For Linda Alcoff (2006), the biological division of reproductive roles
in humans serves as the basis for a distinction in objective type
(174). In her view, women are characterized by a &ldquo;relationship
of possibility to biological reproduction, with biological
reproduction referring to conceiving, giving birth, and
breast-feeding, involving one&rsquo;s own body&rdquo; (172). This
relationship of possibility is partly hermeneutical, by which Alcoff
means that reproductive possibilities shape a life, shape the horizon
of possibilities, by which an embodied individual experiences themself
in relation to their future (175). This account seems to suggest that
no trans women would count as women, since no trans women would have
the right hermeneutical relationship to biological reproduction (while
all trans men would).</p>

<p>
Finally, Mari Mikkola (2009, 2016) argues that no answer to the
question &ldquo;What is a woman?&rdquo; is required to determine the
feminist purview. Rather, feminists need only rely on the intuitions
of ordinary language speakers to determine the concept&rsquo;s
extension. With regard to trans people, however, Mikkola admits that
intuitions may fail us. However, she later goes on to propose that the
trans inclusion question is ultimately going to be settled by nontrans
feminists in negotiation with trans people and is hence political, not
semantic. For example, it may be determined for the purposes of
improving treatments of ovarian cancer, trans women do not count as
women, while trans men would. One worry with this proposal is the
asymmetry in supposing that whether or not trans women are included
within the feminist purview is an open question, while this is not the
case for nontrans women. Another is the oddity in supposing that the
inclusion of trans women is to be determined, in part, by
<em>nontrans</em> feminists when the reverse is not true.</p>

<h3 id="FemPur20">5.2 The Feminist Purview 2.0</h3>

<p>
Stephanie Kapusta (2016) argues from a decidedly trans perspective
that misgendering inflicts moral, psychological, and political harms
on trans people. More pointedly, she argues that any philosophical
analysis of the concepts woman and man, including feminist ones, that
would lead to the misgendering of some group of trans people, if such
an analysis were broadly implemented in society, is unacceptable from
a trans political perspective. It is notable, then, that attempts at
analysis in the twenty-teens were far more attentive to trans
identities.</p>

<p>
Partially in response to Haslanger&rsquo;s ameliorationist account,
Jennifer Saul provides a more descriptivist semantic contextualist
analysis of the term &lsquo;woman&rsquo; that centralizes trans and
intersex people (2012). Saul&rsquo;s aim is to make a case about
methodology &ndash; namely, to show how political considerations, such
as doing justice to trans women&rsquo;s claims to be women have a
bearing on how one does philosophy of language. While she proposes
that the referent of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; as ordinarily used is
determined by context in a rule-governing way such that in many
contexts trans women count as women, it is also not an account she
finally endorses precisely because she does not think it does justice
to the claims of trans women in a non-trivializing way. Specifically,
she notes that while it will be true that trans women are women in
some contexts, it will not be true in others and that, moreover, in
contexts involving restrooms that matter will have to be settled by
extra-semantic moral and political considerations.</p>

<p>
However, Esa D&iacute;az-Le&oacute;n (2016) attempts to address
Saul&rsquo;s reservations (mentioned above) by adopting a semantic
contextualism that is not dependent upon the particular beliefs of the
attributor about the relevant standards at play to make determinations
about, say, restroom use, but, rather, the objective features of the
context itself where the relevant standards are those that are
relevant for practical purposes. Thus, argues D&iacute;az-Le&oacute;n,
the considerations Saul takes to be extra-semantic are semantic after
all. One worry is that regardless of the success of
D&iacute;az-Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s account, there will still be contexts
in which trans women do not count as women and that therefore trans
women will still be marginalized roughly in the way that they are
marginalized in the family-resemblance account (Bettcher 2017b).</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Katharine Jenkins (2016), criticizing the trans
exclusionary upshot of Haslanger&rsquo;s account, attempts a
reformulation of it. The problem, according to Jenkins, concerns
Haslanger&rsquo;s &ldquo;focal analysis&rdquo; (i.e., its centralizing
of gender-as-hierarchy). While Haslanger recognizes multiple senses of
&lsquo;woman&rsquo; (e.g. gender identity), anything other than
gender-as-class would be merely secondary. Jenkins, by contrast,
defends an account with <em>branching</em> target concepts,
gender-as-class and gender-as-identity. She argues that both are
equally important in providing a feminist account of oppression. While
the former is intended to capture external forms of oppression, the
latter is intended to accommodate the possibilities of internalized
oppression (and resistance).</p>

<p>
She changes Haslanger&rsquo;s analysis of <em>functioning as</em> a
woman in some context to an analysis of <em>being classed</em> as a
woman in some context and then she provides a
&ldquo;norm-relevancy&rdquo; account of gender identity according to
which female gender identity is &ldquo;an internal &lsquo;map&rsquo;
that is formed to guide someone&rdquo; classed as a woman through the
social and/or material realities that are, in that context
characteristic of women as a class (Jenkins 2016, 410). In this view,
somebody with a female gender identity will experience feminine norms
as relevant to herself &ndash; that is, as something that can be
complied with or resisted. One worry about Jenkins&rsquo;s account of
identity, is that some trans women may not have such a gender identity
defined in this way prior to any experience in the world as women
(since they haven&rsquo;t been socialized as women) and that,
therefore, they won&rsquo;t count as women in this account after all
(Bettcher 2017a, see also Adler 2017, Barnes 2022 for criticism).</p>

<h2 id="EviDecMakBel">6. Evil Deceivers and Make-Believers</h2>

<p>
In work largely orthogonal to the preceding, from the mid
two-thousands onwards, Talia Mae Bettcher develops a trans feminist
account of trans oppression that, she claims, does not reduce to the
beyond the binary account (discussed above). She begins with the
deceiver/pretender representation of trans people (the view that trans
people are either trying trick people into believing they are
something they are not or that they are openly pretending to be
something they are not). She argues that this representation
constitutes a double-bind &ndash; either come out as a pretender or
refuse and be exposed as a deceiver (2007). This bind, Bettcher
argues, is grounded in what she calls the appearance-reality contrast
(&ldquo;appearing to be a man, is really a woman&rdquo;) and she dubs
this phenomenon by which trans identities are invalidated
&ldquo;reality enforcement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The appearance-reality contrast arises, argues Bettcher, due to a
representational relation between public gender presentation and
private genital status. That is, public gender presentation invasively
communicates genital status (2007). Crucially, for Bettcher,
&ldquo;genital status&rdquo; is not a biological feature, but, rather
a moral one insofar as genitals and information about them are subject
to socially determined boundaries on privacy and decency (2012b). It
is for this reason that &ldquo;reality enforcement&rdquo; is an
abusive phenomenon that cannot be reduced to the verification of some
biological truth.</p>

<p>
Bettcher argues that reality enforcement cannot be accommodated in the
Beyond the Binary Account and that the Wrong Body Account, while
flawed for naturalizing social phenomena and distorting trans
experience, can be understood as a resistant gesture in response to
reality enforcement when deployed by trans people and therefore not as
reactive as hitherto supposed (2014). She also argues that the
communicative function of gender presentation is grounded in (hetero)
sexist and racist sexual violence and sexual manipulation, thereby
providing an account of trans oppression that she feels accommodates
an intersectional analysis in a way that the Beyond the Binary Account
cannot (2007, 2016). This analysis is expanded by Francisco Galarte
(2021) in a Chicano context and Andrea Pitts (2022) in an indigenous
context.</p>

<p>
Drawing on Mar&iacute;a Lugones&rsquo;s (1987) notion of ontological
pluralism, Bettcher argues that alternative practices exist in trans
subcultures (&ldquo;worlds&rdquo;) that do not replicate the abusive
structure in the dominant &ldquo;world&rdquo; and that stand in
contestation to it (2014). These extra discursive practices underwrite
and are interwoven with the discursive practices of gender
attribution. In trans &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;, Bettcher argues, claims
like &ldquo;<em>x</em> is a woman&rdquo; function like
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is sad&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;<em>x</em> is
tall&rdquo; (2009). The former, unlike the latter, involves
privileging first-person, present tense avowals with first-person
authority (FPA). This authority, rather than epistemic, argues
Bettcher, is grounded in an ethical demand for &ldquo;taking
responsibility&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s attitudes by &ldquo;publicly
certifying&rdquo; them and gender avowals specifically are instances
of taking responsibility for one&rsquo;s existential self-identity
(2009). Preceding the so-called transgender tipping point of 2014,
Bettcher&rsquo;s work sets the stage for explosion in trans philosophy
that would follow it.</p>

<h2 id="GenCriFemPhi">7. Gender-Critical Feminism and Philosophy</h2>

<p>
While there had been earlier efforts to promote philosophy written by
trans philosophers, critical mass was not achieved until after the
so-called &lsquo;transgender tipping point&rsquo; of 2014. (The
expression was originally intended to refer to the increased positive
cultural visibility trans people, as exemplified by the appearance of
Laverne Cox on the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine in May 2014. Given
the political backlash against trans people since then, the
qualification &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; appears warranted). The
expression &lsquo;trans philosophy&rsquo; began to circulate around
the time of the Trans Experience in Philosophy Conference in Eugene,
Oregon in 2016, as trans and nonbinary graduate students and junior
professors began to produce work in the nascent field (Zurn 2016).</p>

<p>
It was also around this time that controversy surrounding trans people
in the profession seemed to explode. Most notable was a controversy in
2017 that rocked the journal <em>Hypatia</em> when it published an
article by a white nontrans woman who argued that the legitimacy of
transgender entailed the legitimacy of &ldquo;transracialism&rdquo;
(Tuvel 2017). The publication of the article sparked a backlash
&ndash; a public letter demanding its retraction due to its lack of
grounding in the relevant literature by trans philosophers and
philosophers of color, and then a backlash against the backlash
decrying attacks on academic freedom (Kapusta 2018, Dembroff 2020).
Other moments included a heated engagement between gender-critical
feminist Kathleen Stock and trans feminist philosopher, Talia Mae
Bettcher, as gender-critical feminism was beginning to make its
presence known in the profession of philosophy. (See Dembroff 2020 for
further discussion of these issues).</p>

<p>
Gender-critical feminism expresses concern over the focus on the
concept of gender which it takes to obscure sex-based oppression. In
this view, any other form of gender-based oppression is merely a
collateral effect of the oppression of women. Although details vary,
it is typified by its rejection of trans self-identifying claims and
right to access segregated spaces that align with their identities.
Gender critical feminism can be regarded as continuous with
trans-exclusionary forms of radical feminism, although it need not
be&hellip;. It needn&rsquo;t, for instance, regard sexism as the
preeminent form of oppression, nor need it advocate a total
reformation of society.</p>

<p>
This form of feminism appears to have arisen around the time the
public statement &ldquo;Forbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist
Criticism of Gender&rdquo; (2013) was circulated, signed by prominent
radical feminists (Stryker 2017, 226). While ostensibly a protest of
unfair suppression of any radical feminist critique of trans gender
politics, this radical feminist critique was notably conflated with
feminism per se and touted the importance of excluding trans women
from feminist space. This statement was followed by Sheila
Jeffreys&rsquo;s <em>Gender Hurts</em> (2014), which while largely
rehearsing the arguments of Janice Raymond, also provides a more
in-depth discussion of transgender men &ndash; effectively arguing
transition is motivated by a response to patriarchal domination and
abuse.</p>

<p>
Gender-critical feminists played a crucial role in the defeat of a
proposed reform to the UK&rsquo;s Gender Recognition Act (2004) which
would have shifted the criteria for a Gender Recognition Certificate
from a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to that of
self-identification. The Government Consultation of 2018 led to
considerably controversy, with gender-critical feminists providing the
most prominent voice in opposition to the reform. In the wake of the
defeat of the reform, anti-trans sentiment and legislation has been on
the rise in the UK. Two of the most prominent gender-critical feminist
philosophers are discussed below.</p>

<p>
According to Kathleen Stock, the term &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; in its
ordinary use, means &lsquo;adult, female human.&rsquo; While she
simply asserts this claim, Alex Byrne (2020) has defended the closely
related thesis that the biconditional &lsquo;S is a woman iff S is an
adult human female&rsquo; is true in all possible worlds. His thesis
has subsequently been disputed on several grounds. One general concern
is Byrne&rsquo;s undefended assumption that terms such as
&lsquo;woman&rsquo; have one &ldquo;standard&rdquo; meaning, rather
than possessing meanings that are contextual determined or that are
polysemous (Dembroff 2021). Other grounds involve the &lsquo;adult,
female human&rsquo; formulation itself and its application to trans
women. Heartsilver (2021) argues that even if Byrne&rsquo;s analysis
is correct, trans women who engage in certain gender affirming
technologies may still count as women. Arvan (2023), by contrast,
engages in traditional conceptual analysis to argue that
&lsquo;female&rsquo; and &lsquo;adult&rsquo; are ambiguous between
social and biological senses, that &lsquo;woman&rsquo; is only
interchangeable with &lsquo;adult female&rsquo; in the gendered
(social) sense, and that trans women therefore count as women. (See
also Dembroff 2021 for discussion of the social sense of adult and
Bettcher 2025 for a position related to Arvan&rsquo;s). Adopting an
anti-ameliorationist position, at any rate, Stock argues that
feminists ought not permit any revision in the meaning of the term,
since sex is real (i.e., not merely socially constructed) and since
sex differences matter.</p>

<p>
Some of the reasons Stock (2021) cites for the importance of tracking
sexual differences between male and female humans include the
relevance of biological differences to medical treatment as well as to
social barriers conditioned by those differences (e.g., pregnancy). By
refusing to use sex terms to name biological categories, and by
revising terms like &lsquo;woman&rsquo; away from their alleged
original meaning, Stock claims, valuable information would be lost.
Notably, however, she does not consider the possibility of using the
distinction between &lsquo;cis&rsquo; (or &lsquo;nontrans&rsquo;) and
&lsquo;trans&rsquo; to help track such information &ndash; a
distinction which would prima facie seem to secure more information,
rather than less.</p>

<p>
Stock (2021) also argues that public restrooms, changing rooms, and
the like ought to be segregated on the basis of &ldquo;biological
sex.&rdquo; She argues that the reason for such segregation is the
overall greater physical size and strength of males relative to
females and the tendency of sexual aggression of the former towards
the latter. In light of this, because trans women are biological
males, Stock claims, they ought not be permitted into spaces
designated for females. Finlayson, Jenkins, and Worsdale (2018 &ndash;
see Other Internet Resources) argue, however, that it is far from
clear that biological factors alone contribute to male violence
against females and that socialization would also appear relevant.
Given that trans women have different gender identities, their
experience of socialization is going to be different, and because of
this the inference from male violence to the potential violence of
trans women is questionable. Notably, Stock (2021, 2022) does not
address this argument, nor does she take into account&nbsp;the
evidence that policies allowing trans women access to women&rsquo;s
facilities does not lead to any increase in risk to nontrans women
(Hasenbush <em>et al</em> 2019).</p>

<p>
Holly Lawford-Smith defends a gender-critical feminism which she
regards as a continuation of, yet distinct from, and a revival of
radical feminism (2022). She represents this radical feminism as
entirely trans-exclusive, thereby ignoring the inclusive positions of
some radical feminists. Notably, Lawford-Smith expressly rejects
intersectional feminism on the grounds that it generates too many
issues for feminism to accommodate (2022). Instead, she argues, that
issues caused by intermeshed oppressions ought to be divvied up among
different identity-based groups or referred to a single group devoted
to intersectional matters. While lesbian separatism did not, of
course, use the term &lsquo;intersectionality,&rsquo;
Lawford-Smith&rsquo;s position would require its rejection since it
regards women&rsquo;s oppression as secured through compulsory
heterosexuality.</p>

<p>
Lawford-Smith (2022) regards women as a <em>sex caste</em>. In this
view, biological sex is not socially constructed, and gender consists
in norms that are assigned to the sexes to subjugate females.
(Contrast this with Butler&rsquo;s counter-proposal that these norms
are those that secure heterosexuality while abjecting queerness). In
her view, then, while the oppression of trans men is due to their
being women and thereby part of the oppressed caste, any oppression
trans women is a collateral effect. Specifically, trans women who pass
as (nontrans) women, will be subject to oppression intended for
females, while trans women who do not pass will be punished for
failing to abide by norms of masculinity &ndash; norms which help
secure the subordination of women. One concern is that Lawford-Smith
does not recognize distinctive forms of trans oppression that do not
conform to this dichotomy (Killmister forthcoming). Another is that
she does not even recognize that trans women who do not pass or who
are out as trans are subject to various forms of sexism and sexist
violence (Killmister forthcoming). For a thorough critique of
Lawford-Smith&rsquo;s metaphysics, see Killmister forthcoming.</p>

<p>
Like Stock, Lawford-Smith argues for sex-segregation on the basis of
&ldquo;biological sex.&rdquo; However, unlike Stock, Lawford-Smith
addresses the argument (above) from Finlayson, Jenkins, and Worsdale
(2018 &ndash; see OIR). Lawford-Smith&rsquo;s strategy (2022) is to
dismiss the notion of gender identity as merely philosophical,
disregarding its deep roots in sexology and psychology, and instead
embracing the controversial&nbsp;theories of Ray Blanchard who
distinguished trans women into those with &ldquo;autogynephilia&rdquo;
and those who were homosexual (see Serano 2020 for a summary of the
views as well as the concerns). Like Stock, Lawford-Smith does not
take into account the evidence indicating that trans-inclusive
policies leads to no increase in risk of violence against (nontrans)
women (Hasenbush <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>

<h2 id="DecFemTra">8. Decolonial Feminism/Decolonizing Trans</h2>

<p>
While the concept of intersectionality recognizes the intermeshing of
vectors of oppression such as racism and sexism, decolonial feminism
situates these intersections historically in the emergence of
settler-colonialism and slavery. The most influential theorist in this
tradition has been Mar&iacute;a Lugones (2007, 2010, 2020). Drawing on
An&iacute;bal Quijano&rsquo;s work, Lugones recognizes &ldquo;the
coloniality of power&rdquo; and &ldquo;the coloniality of
modernity.&rdquo; The former involves the worldwide imposition of
racial categories and thereby the racialization of the social areas of
labor, collective authority, sex, and subjectivity/intersubjectivity.
The latter involves the naturalization of European ways of knowing and
with that the representation of Europeans as &ldquo;culturally
advanced&rdquo; and non-Europeans as &ldquo;primitive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Lugones (2007) breaks from Quijano by bringing out his assumptions
that the social area of sex involves male heterosexual access to
females. Specifically, he presumes the inferiority of females, sexual
dimorphism, and heterosexualism. According to Lugones (2007), however,
these are not natural facts but features of the Eurocentric-system.
Lugones (2007) then posits what she calls the colonial/modern gender
system in which there is both a light and dark side of the gender that
is of a piece with the imposition of race. While the light side
involves the presumptions of female inferiority, sexual dimorphism,
and heterosexualism, the dark side involves deviancy and deficiency
with regard to the light. In other words, while the gender system was
imposed on those who were colonized and enslaved, they were not
situated on the light side. This, in turn, raises concerns about any
politics which focuses on the light side of gender exclusively.</p>

<p>
In subsequent work, Lugones (2010) develops this view in two important
ways. First, using &lsquo;gender&rsquo; in the sense of the cultural
correlate of sex, she argues that those on the dark side were not
taken to have gender. Instead, &ldquo;sex was made to stand
alone.&rdquo; Because of this, maintains Lugones, anatomical females
on the dark side were not constituted as women, anatomical males were
not constituted as men, and through these respective failures neither
were constituted as human. Second, using &lsquo;gender&rsquo; to name
the system of power in which gender (above) and sex were
co-constituted racially, Lugones rejects the presumption of gender
universality &ndash; namely that all cultures have &ldquo;gender
relations.&rdquo; In light of the latter, Lugones is suspicious of the
possibility of resistance through the gender system and, more
specifically, any resistant reclamations of womanhood since such
resistance would obscure the way in which gender was imposed on
cultures without any such correlate. Consequently, Lugones (2020) is
specifically critical of queer and trans theory for presuming gender
universality and for promoting the proliferation of genders as a mode
of resistance (see Butler).</p>

<p>
Brooklyn Leo (2020), however, raises worries about Lugones own
presumption of &ldquo;cisness&rdquo; and her erasure of both the
oppression and resistance of Two-Spirit peoples under colonialism
through her own account which, as discussed above, merely
distinguishes between anatomical males and females and cannot
therefore register violence specific Two-Spirit people. Moreover, Leo
contests Lugones&rsquo;s claim that resistance is not possible through
the colonial/modern gender system, pointing, for instance, to the work
of C. Riley Snorton (2017) . Snorton argues that the racist treatment
of black people as fungible and ungendered was utilized for purposes
of escaping slavery through cross-dressing and passing. Indeed, argues
Snorton, the development of these practices paved the way for what is
now called &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; so that trans and blackness are
inextricably bound together.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Bettcher (2025), developing her own account more deeply,
attempts to answer Lugones&rsquo;s challenge to trans theory by
situating &ldquo;reality enforcement&rdquo; within the colonial/modern
gender system. Specifically, Bettcher argues for the constructedness
of nakedness, recasting the contrast between public gender
presentation and genital status as a contrast between proper (clothed)
and intimate (unclothed) appearance which together constitute what she
calls &ldquo;the physical person.&rdquo; Bettcher introduces the
notion of interpersonal spatiality &ndash; the thought that all
sensory and discursive encounters between us admit of closeness and
distance as determined by boundaries &ndash; and argues that physical
personhood is a function of an abusive system of interpersonal
spatiality (&ldquo;the folk system&rdquo;) which admits of a
distinction in types of boundary structures (morally male and morally
female) which she calls &ldquo;moral sex&rdquo;. Bettcher argues that
this system was a feature of the colonial/modern gender system where
those on the dark side were dehumanized through associations between
nakedness and &ldquo;primitivity&rdquo; and denials of modesty.
Further, Bettcher proposes that while gender may not be universal,
interpersonal spatiality likely is and that this opens the door to
resistant possibilities of refiguring elements of the colonial/modern
system by redeploying them in resistant forms of interpersonal
spatiality.</p>

<h2 id="Con">9. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
While early (nontrans) feminist perspectives on trans issues were
marked by hostility, trans studies and politics have emerged in
complex reaction and interaction with feminist and queer theory and
politics as something to be recognized. As time has passed, it seems
the possibility of productive interplay between feminist and trans
theory and politics as well as solidarity between trans and nontrans
feminist is being realized. However, as trans people have become
increasingly visible a resurgence in anti-trans sentiment has made
these developments more challenging.</p>
