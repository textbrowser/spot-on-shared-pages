<h1>Prioritarianism as a Theory of Value</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Mar 24, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Prioritarianism is generally understood as a kind of <em>moral
axiology</em>. An axiology provides an account of what makes items, in
this case outcomes, good or bad, better or worse. A <em>moral</em>
axiology focuses on <em>moral</em> value: on what makes outcomes
<em>morally</em> good or bad, <em>morally</em> better or worse.
Prioritarianism, specifically, posits that the moral-betterness
ranking of outcomes gives extra weight (&ldquo;priority&rdquo;) to
well-being gains and losses affecting those at lower levels of
well-being. It differs from utilitarianism, which is indifferent to
the well-being levels of those affected by gains and
 losses.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Although it is possible to construe prioritarianism as a
non-axiological moral view, this entry follows the prevailing approach
and trains its attention on axiological prioritarianism. We use the
terms &ldquo;good,&rdquo; &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; &ldquo;better,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;worse,&rdquo; applied to outcomes, as shorthand for
<em>morally</em> good, bad, better, and worse. By an
&ldquo;outcome,&rdquo; we mean a possible world&mdash;but our analysis
transposes to &ldquo;outcome&rdquo; understood in related senses,
e.g., as a simplified model of a possible world, or as a partial
specification of a possible world sufficient to determine each
person&rsquo;s well-being.</p>

<p>
The debate between prioritarians and their critics has generally
concerned outcome betterness/worseness (what makes it the case that
one outcome is better than, worse than, or equally good as a second)
rather than outcome goodness/badness (what makes it the case that a
given outcome is good or bad). This entry&rsquo;s focus is the former.
We will speak of prioritarianism as providing a &ldquo;betterness
ranking&rdquo; of outcomes and contrast it with the betterness ranking
offered by utilitarianism, egalitarianism, and sufficientism.</p>

<p>
What is the relation between prioritarianism and consequentialism?
Consequentialism is the class of moral views which stipulate that the
moral status of choices (actions) is determined by moral axiology.
More concretely: in a given choice situation, a <em>right</em> choice
is a choice with an outcome that is at least as good as that of any
other available choice; all other choices are <em>wrong</em>.
Prioritarianism might be joined with consequentialism; if so, we have
a moral theory which posits that the right choice in a given situation
is the choice with the best outcome as per a prioritarian axiology.
But it need not be thus joined. The moral status of choices might be
determined <em>both</em> by the betterness ranking of outcomes
<em>and</em> by other moral factors, such as deontological
constraints. We bracket consequentialism, and in exploring
prioritarianism assume only that axiology has <em>some</em> role in
determining the moral status of choices.</p>

<p>
The entry is organized as follows. Section 1 addresses the definition
of prioritarianism. The definition employed here is: prioritarianism
ranks outcomes according to the sum of <em>transformed</em> individual
(lifetime) well-being: transformed by a strictly increasing and
strictly concave function. Section 1 presents this definition and
discusses alternatives. Section 2 discusses Derek Parfit&rsquo;s 1991
Lindley Lecture (Parfit 2000)&mdash;the scholarly work that drew
significant philosophical attention to prioritarianism and thereby
triggered intensive debates and analysis about the view. Section 3
reviews arguments in favor of prioritarianism. Section 4 discusses
prioritarianism under uncertainty. Sections 5, 6, and 7 review
challenges to prioritarianism by, respectively, utilitarians,
egalitarians, and sufficientists.</p>

<p>
The entry proceeds on the premise that the population of concern
(those individuals whose well-being drives the betterness ranking) is:
all human persons. This premise is generally adopted by the literature
on prioritarianism, but&mdash;of course&mdash;is problematic in
excluding non-human animals. How to extend prioritarianism to
non-human animals is a topic of great importance for future research
(cf. Vallentyne 2005, discussing egalitarianism and animals, and
Holtug 2007b, discussing prioritarianism and animals), one that is not
addressed here.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;membership&rdquo; of a given outcome is the subset of the
population that exists in that outcome. The fixed-population component
of a particular axiology specifies the betterness ranking of any group
of outcomes all of which have the same membership. In presenting
prioritarianism and considering alternatives (Sections 1 through 7),
the entry simplifies matters by focusing on the fixed-population
components of prioritarianism and competing axiologies. Section 8
addresses variable-population problems: how does prioritarianism rank
outcomes with varying <span  class="nw">membership?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

<h2 id="WhaPri">1. What is Prioritarianism?</h2>

<h3 id="PriBetRan">1.1 Prioritarianism as a Betterness Ranking</h3>

<p>
Consider a set of outcomes \(\mathbf{O}\), with a fixed membership:
the very same human persons exist in all of the outcomes. Thus this is
a fixed-population case. We&rsquo;ll assume that there are \(N\) such
human persons in total. We&rsquo;ll use &ldquo;individual&rdquo; to
mean one of these human persons.</p>

<p>
As is standard, we assume that the betterness ranking of
\(\mathbf{O}\) is transitive: if one outcome is at least as good as a
second, and the second is at least as good as a third, then the first
is at least as good as the third. To simplify the presentation, we
also assume that this ranking is complete: as between any two
outcomes, either the first is better than the second, or the second is
better than the first, or the two are equally good.</p>

<p>
Finally, lifetime well-being is measurable. In each outcome, each
individual has a well-being number: \(w_i (x)\) is the well-being
number of individual \(i\) in outcome \(x\). These numbers represent
intra- and interpersonal comparisons of lifetime well-being. Moreover,
since neither utilitarianism nor prioritariansm is well-defined absent
information about well-being differences, we&rsquo;ll also assume that
the numbers represent intra- and interpersonal comparisons of
differences in lifetime
 well-being.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 (For the remainder of the entry, we use &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; as
shorthand for &ldquo;lifetime well-being.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>
Given well-being measurability, each outcome corresponds to a list of
well-being numbers, one for each of the \(N\) individuals.</p>

<p>
A &ldquo;welfarist&rdquo; betterness ranking conforms to the axioms of
<em>Pareto Indifference, Strong Pareto</em>, and <em>Anonymity</em>.
<em>Pareto Indifference</em>: If each person is unaffected as between
\(x\) and \(y\), the two outcomes are equally good. (An individual is
&ldquo;unaffected&rdquo; as between two outcomes if equally well off
in the two.) <em>Strong Pareto</em>. If each person is at least as
well off in \(x\) as in \(y\), and at least one person is better off
in \(x\), then \(x\) is better than \(y\). <em>Anonymity</em>: If the
list of individuals&rsquo; well-being levels in \(x\) is a permutation
of the list in \(y, x\) and \(y\) are equally good.</p>

<p>
Pareto Indifference says: two outcomes don&rsquo;t differ morally
unless they differ with respect to at least one person&rsquo;s
well-being. Strong Pareto says: well-being makes a positive
contribution to moral betterness. Anonymity says: it is the pattern of
well-being in an outcome, impartially described, and not the
identities of the individuals at particular levels, that matters for
moral betterness. (See Adler 2022a for formal statements of these
axioms and the Pigou-Dalton, Separability, and Continuity axioms
discussed below.)</p>

<p>
Welfarism is controversial, to be sure, but for present purposes we
take it as given. Both utilitarianism and prioritarianism (in its
standard formulation) are welfarist. What prioritarianism puts on the
table is the possibility of significant debate <em>within</em> the
space of welfarist axiology.</p>

<p>
The utilitarian betterness ranking assigns each outcome a score</p>

\[ m^\textit{util}(x) = w_1 (x) + \ldots + w_N (x) \]

<p>
and ranks outcomes according to these scores. By contrast, a
prioritarian betterness ranking assigns each outcome a score</p>

\[m^\textit{prior}(x) = g(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + g(w_N (x)),\]

<p>
with \(g(\cdot)\) a strictly increasing and strictly concave function
(see Figure 1), and ranks outcomes according to <em>these</em> scores.
To say that this function is &ldquo;strictly increasing&rdquo; means
that it assigns greater values to greater inputs. To say that it is
&ldquo;strictly concave&rdquo; means that it bends over: more
precisely, that the \(g(\cdot)\) value it assigns to any mixture of
input values exceeds the mixture of their \(g(\cdot)\)
 values.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<div class="figure avoid-break">
<img alt="A graph of Transformed well-being g(w) in the y-axis against Well-being w in the x-axis. There is a solid concave curve beginning at (0,0) and arcing up. Four points on the curve are distinguished, given here in increasing order of x-axis value: (w_L, g(w_L)), (w_L+Delta_w, g(w_L+Delta_w), (w_H-Delta_w,g(w_H-Delta_w), (w_H,g(w_H)). The x-axis distance between w_L and w_L+Delta_w is the same as the x-axis distance between w_H-Delta_w and w_H. But the transformed well-being distance on the y-axis between the first pair g(w_L) and g(w_L+Delta_w) is greater than that between g(w_H-Delta_w) and g(w_H)." src="figure1.png" style="height:464px; width:521px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>
In a nutshell, utilitarian betterness is the sum of well-being, while
prioritarian betterness is the sum of concavely transformed
well-being. It is the concave transformation function, \(g(\cdot)\),
that allows prioritarianism to give priority to the worse off. (We use
&ldquo;concave&rdquo; in reference to this transformation function as
shorthand for strictly increasing and strictly concave.)
Utilitarianism is a single ranking, while prioritarianism is a whole
<em>family</em> of rankings&mdash;each member of this family defined
by a specific transformation function. (See Adler 2022a regarding the
choice of function.)</p>

<p>
Welfarist rankings that are neither utilitarian nor prioritarian are
certainly available. The following possibilities are frequently
discussed in the literature. (See Adler 2019 for formal statements of
these rankings.)</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>A generalized-Gini ranking</em>: There are fixed positive weights
\(k_1 , \ldots ,k_N\), each larger than the next. A given outcome
\(x\) is assigned a score equaling \(k_1\) times the lowest well-being
number in \(x\) plus \(k_2\) times the second-lowest well-being number
in \(x\) plus &hellip; plus \(k_N\) times the highest well-being
number in \(x\). Outcomes are ranked according to these scores.
(Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson 2005, ch. 4; Buchak 2017,
2023).</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>The leximin ranking</em>: Two outcomes are compared according to
the well-being levels of the worst-off individuals, with \(x\) better
than \(y\) if the worst-off individual in \(x\) is better off than the
worst-off individual in \(y\); if the worst off are equally well off
in the two outcomes, then they are compared according to the
well-being levels of the second-worst-off individuals; etc.
(Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson 2005, ch. 4)</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>A sufficientist ranking</em>. This ranking uses some threshold
level of well-being \(w^\textit{Thresh}\). An individual&rsquo;s
&ldquo;capped&rdquo; well-being equals her well-being, if less than
\(w^\textit{Thresh}\), otherwise \(w^\textit{Thresh}\). An
individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;bottomed&rdquo; well-being equals her
well-being, if greater than \(w^\textit{Thresh}\), otherwise
\(w^\textit{Thresh}\). Each outcome is assigned two scores: a primary
score equaling the sum of individuals&rsquo; concavely transformed
capped well-being; and a secondary score equaling the sum of
individuals&rsquo; bottomed well-being. Each pair of outcomes is
ranked according to their primary scores; and, if those are equal,
according to their secondary scores.</p>

<p class="indent">
Via this formula, sufficientism gives absolute priority to the
well-being of below-threshold individuals, over the well-being of
above-threshold individuals; it converges with prioritarianism in
comparing two outcomes such that all affected individuals are below
the threshold; and it converges with utilitarianism in comparing two
outcomes such that all affected individuals are above the threshold.
(On sufficientism, see sources cited below, Section 7).</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Prioritarianism with a lexical threshold (PLT)</em>. The same
formula as sufficientism, except that the secondary score for an
outcome equals the sum of individuals&rsquo; concavely transformed
bottomed well-being. (Like sufficientism, PLT gives absolute priority
to the well-being of below-threshold individuals, over the well-being
of above-threshold individuals. Unlike sufficientism, it converges
with prioritarianism not only in comparing two outcomes such that all
affected individuals are below the threshold, but also in comparing
two outcomes such that all affected individuals are above the
threshold.) (Brown 2005).</p>

<p>
The distinctive features of prioritarianism, as compared both with
utilitarianism and with welfarist rankings that are neither
utilitarian nor prioritarian, are clarified by three axioms:
<em>Pigou-Dalton</em>, <em>Separability</em>, and
<em>Continuity</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Pigou-Dalton</em>. A pure transfer of well-being from a better-off
to a worse-off person that shrinks the gap between their well-being
levels and leaves everyone else unaffected is a moral improvement. (By
&ldquo;pure transfer,&rdquo; we mean that the loss of well-being for
the transferor equals the gain of well-being for the transferee.)</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Separability</em>. The ranking of two outcomes is independent of
the well-being levels of unaffected individuals.</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Continuity</em>. If \(x\) is better/worse than \(y\), then \(x^*\)
is also better/worse than \(y\) as long as everyone&rsquo;s well-being
in \(x^*\) is sufficiently close to their well-being in \(x\).</p>

<p>
To illustrate, assume a population of four individuals. Let a list of
four numbers, e.g. (3, 9, 1, 7), indicate the well-being levels of the
four individuals in a given outcome. <em>Pigou-Dalton</em> requires
that (10, 2, 25, 5) be worse than (7, 5, 25, 5), since we get from the
first to the second outcome by transferring 3 units of well-being from
the first to the second individual, affecting no one else and
shrinking the gap between them. <em>Separability</em> requires that if
(5, 5, 5, 5) is better than (10, 3, 5, 5), then (5, 5, 80, 30) is
better than (10, 3, 80, 30). (Note that the third and fourth
individuals are unaffected in the first pair of outcomes and that the
second pair of outcomes is identical to the first except for those
individuals&rsquo; well-being levels.) <em>Continuity</em> requires
that if (1, 9, 12, 15) is better than (1, 7, 50, 100), then \((1 -
\varepsilon,\) \(9 - \varepsilon,\) \(12 - \varepsilon,\) \(15 -
\varepsilon)\) is also better than (1, 7, 50, 100) for \(\varepsilon\)
sufficiently small.</p>

<span class="smaller"><sup>&dagger;</sup> Pigou-Dalton not satisfied
for transfers between above-threshold individuals</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Several important points emerge from Table 1. First, Pigou-Dalton is
the axiom that differentiates utilitarianism and prioritarianism.
Utilitarianism fails Pigou-Dalton: if we reduce a better-off
person&rsquo;s well-being by \(\Delta w\), and increase a worse-off
person&rsquo;s well-being by the same amount, the sum total of
well-being is unchanged&mdash;and thus utilitarianism sees the
transfer as a matter of moral indifference. Figure 1 illustrates why
prioritarianism <em>satisfies</em> Pigou-Dalton: the increase in
<em>concavely transformed</em> well-being of the worse-off individual
(at well-being level \(w_L)\) exceeds the loss in concavely
transformed well-being of the better-off one (at \(w_H)\).</p>

<p>
Pigou-Dalton makes precise the sense in which prioritarianism gives
&ldquo;priority to the worse off&rdquo; while utilitarianism does
not.</p>

<p>
Second, prioritarianism is the only one of these rankings that
satisfies the trio of Pigou-Dalton, Separability, and Continuity. This
is not because we&rsquo;ve been selective in our choice of
alternatives to prioritarianism. It can be shown that <em>if</em> a
welfarist ranking satisfies this trio, it must be prioritarian (Adler
2022a, pp. 65&ndash;66).</p>

<h3 id="PriModJus">1.2 Prioritarianism as a Mode of Justification</h3>

<p>
We use &ldquo;prioritarianism&rdquo; to mean a particular family of
betterness rankings: those that rank outcomes according to the sum of
concavely transformed well-being. However,
&ldquo;prioritarianism&rdquo; is sometimes used in a different
way&mdash;to name a type of <em>justification</em> for a given
ranking. In particular, debates between egalitarians and prioritarians
are often (at least in part) debates about the mode of justification.
(See Sections 2, 6.) In these debates, the term
&ldquo;egalitarianism&rdquo; is often used to mean a mode of
justification which gives intrinsic value to equality, and
&ldquo;prioritarianism&rdquo; to mean a mode of justification that,
inter alia, does not give intrinsic value to equality.</p>

<p>
The following illustrates the difference between modes of
justification and betterness rankings. Imagine that we adopt an
egalitarian mode of justification. In order to operationalize this
approach, we will need to specify how to measure the degree of
well-being inequality in an outcome. Let \(I(\cdot)\) be the
inequality metric we adopt; \(I(x)\) is the inequality score we assign
to outcome \(x\), with \(I(x) \gt I(y)\) indicating that there is more
well-being inequality in \(x\) than \(y\) (according to our chosen
metric). If reducing inequality is <em>all</em> that we care about, we
will violate the Strong Pareto axiom. So let&rsquo;s assume that we
care both about the degree of well-being inequality <em>and</em> about
overall well-being. We justify the comparative betterness of a given
pair of outcomes as a function of these <em>two</em> factors.</p>

<p>
An important mathematical theorem, the &ldquo;Decomposition
Theorem,&rdquo; shows the following (Adler 2022a, p. 100, n. 63).
<em>Any</em> welfarist betterness ranking that satisfies the
Pigou-Dalton and Continuity axioms can be expressed as ranking
outcomes using the score \((w_1 (x) + \ldots + w_N (x)) - I(x)\) where
\(I(\cdot)\) is some inequality metric. The Decomposition Theorem
applies to prioritarian rankings. While the standard formula for
prioritarianism is to score outcomes using the score
\(m^\textit{prior}(x) = g(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + g(w_N (x)),\) the
Decomposition Theorem shows that the very same ranking (for any given
transformation function) can be achieved using a different scoring
method, namely \((w_1 (x) + \ldots + w_N (x)) - I(x)\), for some
inequality metric \(I(\cdot)\).</p>

<p>
The Decomposition Theorem crisply illustrates the possibility of an
<em>egalitarian</em> justification for a <em>prioritarian</em>
ranking. <em>Whatever</em> the transformation function \(g(\cdot)\),
there is some inequality metric such that the prioritarian ranking
using that transformation function is exactly the ranking that would
emerge via an egalitarian mode of reasoning: balancing overall
well-being against inequality as measured by \(I(\cdot)\). On this
topic, see Fleurbaey (2015); Jensen (2003).</p>

<p>
To avoid confusion, we will explicitly use the term &ldquo;mode of
justification&rdquo; or a similar term whenever
&ldquo;egalitarian&rdquo; and &ldquo;prioritarian&rdquo; are used to
designate one or another such mode.</p>

<h3 id="RisBasDefPri">1.3 A Risk-Based Definition of Prioritarianism</h3>

<p>
Unlike much of the literature, David McCarthy (2013, 2017) defines
prioritarianism neither as a type of betterness ranking of outcomes,
nor as a mode of justification, but instead as a cluster of axioms for
ranking lotteries. Space constraints preclude a discussion of
McCarthy&rsquo;s view here; see Adler and Holtug (2019).</p>

<h2 id="Par">2. Parfit</h2>

<p>
Prioritarianism comes to prominence in the philosophical literature
with Derek Parfit&rsquo;s 1991 Lindley Lecture (Parfit 2000). Although
some philosophers (McKerlie 1984; Temkin 1983; Weirich 1983) and also
some economists had discussed prioritarianism (not using that
terminology; see Adler and Norheim 2022b for a survey) prior to the
Lindley Lecture, this is the scholarly work that triggered intensive
philosophical debate about the view.</p>

<p>
In the lecture, Parfit introduces prioritarianism by discussing a
hypothetical case previously described by the philosopher Thomas Nagel
(1979, pp. 123-24). In this case, Nagel has to choose between living
in the suburb, which is better for one of his children, who is
healthy; and living in the city, thereby providing access to treatment
for a second child, who has a serious health condition. The gain to
the first child from living in the suburb is greater than the gain to
the second child from living in the city. Parfit represents the
interests of the two children using the numbers displayed in Table 2
(everyone else is unaffected).</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Table 2.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Utilitarianism recommends moving to the suburb. The sum total of the
children&rsquo;s well-being in the suburb \((25 + 9)\) is greater than
the sum total of their well-being in the city \((20 + 10)\). Nagel
supposes that, if he decides instead to move to the city, &ldquo;it
would be an egalitarian decision&rdquo; (Parfit 2000, p. 81). Parfit
uses the case to explore the content of egalitarianism and to propose
an alternative rationale for moving to the city: &ldquo;the Priority
View&rdquo; (or, as it&rsquo;s come to be known,
&ldquo;prioritarianism&rdquo;). Parfit discusses both axiological
(&ldquo;Telic&rdquo;) and deontic egalitarianism. Because our interest
here is axiology, we leave aside Parfit&rsquo;s analysis of deontic
egalitarianism and focus on the contrast he draws between axiological
egalitarianism and prioritarianism. In what follows,
&ldquo;axiological&rdquo; is implicit.</p>

<p>
The version of egalitarianism that Parfit explores is
&ldquo;pluralist&rdquo; egalitarianism, which endorses two principles:
a &ldquo;principle of equality&rdquo; (&ldquo;It is in itself bad if
some people are worse off than others&rdquo;) and a &ldquo;principle
of utility&rdquo; (&ldquo;It is in itself better if people are better
off&rdquo;) (p. 84). Pure egalitarianism, consisting only of the first
principle, would be indifferent between everyone being equally well
off at a given level of well-being, and everyone being equally well
off at a higher level of well-being. Pluralism is needed to avoid this
result. Pluralist egalitarianism, in turn, can take a
&ldquo;strong&rdquo; or &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; form. To see the
contrast between the two, consider two outcomes \(x\) and \(y\) such
that some are worse off in \(y\) and no one is better off, but
well-being is more equally distributed in \(y\) than \(x\). Strong
pluralist egalitarians recognize some such cases in which, on balance,
\(y\) is better than \(x\). Moderate pluralist egalitarians insist
that, in every such case, \(y\) is on balance worse than \(x\). In
short, moderate pluralist egalitarians endorse an
all-things-considered betterness ranking (taking account of both the
principle of equality and the principle of utility) that satisfies the
Strong Pareto axiom, while strong pluralist egalitarians endorse an
all-things-considered betterness ranking that violates the Strong
Pareto axiom.</p>

<p>
Parfit notes that egalitarianism is subject to what he calls the
&ldquo;Levelling Down Objection.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If inequality is bad, its disappearance must be in one way a change
for the better, <em>however this change occurs</em>. Suppose that
those who are better off suffer some misfortune, so that they become
as badly off as everyone else. Since these events would remove the
inequality, they must be in one way welcome [for egalitarians], even
though they would be worse for some people, and better for no one.
This implication seems to many to be quite absurd. I call this
<em>the</em> <em>Levelling Down Objection</em>. (p. 98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Pure egalitarianism and strong pluralist egalitarianism are clearly
subject to the Levelling Down Objection. What&rsquo;s critical to
recognize is that <em>moderate</em> pluralist egalitarianism is
<em>also</em> subject to this objection. Return again to the case in
which some are worse off in \(y\) than \(x\), none are better off, but
well-being is more equally distributed in \(y\). Even
<em>moderate</em> pluralist egalitarians agree that \(y\) is better
than \(x\) <em>in one respect</em>. Pure, strong pluralist, and
moderate pluralist egalitarians <em>all</em> endorse the principle of
equality. Well-being is more equally distributed in \(y\) and
so&mdash;on any view that endorses this principle&mdash;\(y\) is
better in one respect than \(x\).</p>

<p>
Egalitarians may well not be bothered by the Levelling Down Objection.
Our aim, here, is not to consider the persuasiveness of that
objection, but rather to see how it figures in Parfit&rsquo;s
distinction <em>between</em> egalitarianism and prioritarianism (but
for further discussion of the objection, see Section 6.1).</p>

<p>
Having discussed egalitarianism, Parfit turns to an alternative
rationale for departing from utilitarianism in the two-child case:
&ldquo;<em>The Priority View</em>: Benefitting people matters more the
worse off these people are&rdquo; (p. 101).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For Utilitarians, the moral importance of each benefit depends only on
how great this benefit would be. For <em>Prioritarians</em>, it also
depends on how well off the person is to whom this benefit comes. We
should not give equal weight to equal benefits, whoever receives them.
Benefits to the worse off should be given more weight. (p. 101)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Parfit does not say so explicitly, he uses
&ldquo;prioritarianism&rdquo; (&ldquo;the Priority View&rdquo;) to
mean both a mode of justification and a betterness ranking. A careful
reading of the Lindley Lecture allows us to unpack these two
strands.</p>

<p>
(1) <em>Mode of Justification</em>. &ldquo;Egalitarianism,&rdquo; for
Parfit, clearly is a mode of justification, a way to think about moral
betterness: one that justifies the outcome ranking at least in part by
appeal to the principle of equality. Prioritarianism, by contrast,
appeals to a different idea, namely that &ldquo;benefitting people
matters more the worse off these people are.&rdquo; Parfit&rsquo;s
view of egalitarianism and prioritarianism as distinct modes of
justification is made clear, for example, when he writes: &ldquo;On
[the Priority View], we do <em>not</em> believe in equality. We give
priority to the worse off, not because this will reduce inequality,
but for other reasons&rdquo; (p. 103). Parfit, here, is distinguishing
between egalitarian <em>reasons</em> for channeling well-being
improvements to the worse-off rather than the better-off (namely, that
doing so reduces well-being inequality) and prioritarian
<em>reasons</em> for doing that (namely, that well-being increments
have greater moral weight if received by those who are worse off).
Parfit is also thinking of egalitarianism and prioritarianism as
distinct modes of justification when he states that prioritarianism
avoids the Levelling Down Objection. In the \(x/y\) case above, both
prioritarians and moderate pluralist egalitarians would agree that
\(x\) is better. The ranking of the two outcomes is the same. And yet
(as Parfit sees it) prioritarianism avoids the Levelling Down
Objection because the <em>reason</em> it gives for \(x\) being better
is that an increase in someone&rsquo;s well-being always makes a
positive moral contribution, while moderate pluralist egalitarianism
runs afoul of that Objection because it gives a different
<em>reason</em> for \(x\) being better (namely, that equality and
overall well-being balance against each other so as to result in that
ranking).</p>

<p>
(2) <em>Betterness Ranking</em>. Parfit does not explicitly articulate
the prioritarian betterness ranking in the standard form now adopted
in the philosophical literature, namely as the sum of concavely
transformed well-being (see Section 1) or, equivalently, as a ranking
that satisfies Pareto Indifference, Strong Pareto, Anonymity,
Pigou-Dalton, Separability, and Continuity. But Parfit describes the
commitments of prioritarianism, as regards moral betterness, so as to
suggest that it endorses all of these axioms. Pareto Indifference and
Anonymity are implicit in his treatment of both egalitarian and
prioritarian axiology; in both cases, what matters is the pattern of
well-being, impartially considered. As for Strong Pareto, Parfit
writes: the Priority View &ldquo;contains the idea that benefits are
good&rdquo; (pp. 103&ndash;04). As for Pigou&ndash;Dalton:
&ldquo;benefits matter more the worse off the people are who receive
them&rdquo; (p. 104). (This statement and similar statements are
Parfit&rsquo;s summary of prioritarian <em>reasoning</em>, but they
also directly support Pigou-Dalton.)</p>

<p>
As for Separability, the Lindley Lecture stresses that prioritarians
do not care about &ldquo;relativities.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[O]n the Priority View, we do not believe in equality. We do not think
it in itself bad, or unjust, that some people are worse off than
others. This claim can be misunderstood. We do of course think it bad
that some people are worse off. But what is bad is not that these
people are worse off than <em>others</em>. It is rather that they are
worse off than <em>they</em> might have been.</p>

<p>
Consider next the central claim of the Priority View: benefits to the
worse off matter more. &hellip; On this view, if I am worse off than
you, benefits to me are more important. Is this <em>because</em> I am
worse off than you? In one sense, yes. But this has nothing to do with
my relation to you.</p>

<p>
It may help to use this analogy. People at higher altitudes find it
harder to breathe. Is this because they are higher up than other
people? In one sense, yes. But they would find it just as hard to
breathe even if there were no other people who were lower down. In the
same way, on the Priority View, benefits to the worse off matter more,
but that is only because these people are at a lower <em>absolute</em>
level. It is irrelevant that these people are worse off <em>than
others</em>. &hellip;</p>

<p>
The chief difference is, then, this. Egalitarians are concerned with
<em>relativities</em>: with how each person&rsquo;s level compares
with the level of other people. On the Priority View, we are concerned
only with people&rsquo;s absolute levels. (p. 104)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Separability is a crisp axiomatic expression of an absence of concern
with relativities. Finally, Parfit writes that, for prioritarians,
&ldquo;utility [well-being] has diminishing marginal <em>moral
importance</em>&rdquo; (p. 105). This statement supports not only the
Pigou-Dalton axiom but also (for technical reasons) the Continuity
axiom, since to speak of the &ldquo;marginal moral importance&rdquo;
of well-being assumes that there is a differentiable and, hence,
continuous function mapping the array of individual well-being numbers
in an outcome onto its moral value.</p>

<h2 id="ArgForPri">3. Arguments for Prioritarianism</h2>

<p>
The arguments that follow work within welfarism, i.e., take as given
Pareto Indifference, Strong Pareto, and Anonymity. Pigou-Dalton is the
axiom that distingishes prioritarianism from utilitarianism, and that
encapsulates the sense in which prioritarianism accords priority to
the worse off. Betterness rankings that respect Pigou-Dalton might be
termed &ldquo;extended prioritarian.&rdquo; These include not merely
prioritarianism proper, but also generalized-Gini rankings, leximin,
and PLT rankings.</p>

<p>
We consider, first, arguments for Pigou-Dalton&mdash;that is, for the
wide class of <em>extended-prioritarian</em> betterness
rankings&mdash;and then, within that class, for Separability and for
Continuity.</p>

<h3 id="DefExtPriArgForPigDal">3.1 Defending Extended Prioritarianism: Arguments for Pigou-Dalton</h3>

<p>
A variety of arguments for Pigou-Dalton can be gleaned from the
literature. In what follows, by &ldquo;Pigou-Dalton transfer,&rdquo;
we mean a change in individuals&rsquo; well-being that meets the
condition for the Pigou-Dalton axiom: a better-off individual&rsquo;s
well-being decreases by \(\Delta w\), a worse-off individual&rsquo;s
well-being increases by the same amount, the gap between them shrinks,
and everyone else is unaffected.</p>

<p>
(1) <em>Egalitarian Reasoning</em>. An egalitarian mode of
justification, to be consistent with the Strong Pareto axiom, needs to
be pluralist (as explained by Parfit in the Lindley Lecture). Most
simply, pluralist egalitarianism considers two factors: overall
well-being and the degree of well-being inequality. A standard
inequality metric \(I(\cdot)\) is such that, if \(y\) is reached from
\(x\) via a Pigou-Dalton transfer, then \(I(y) \lt I(x)\). (Cowell
2016). Further, in the case of a Pigou-Dalton transfer, overall
well-being remains constant. Thus we have a straightforward
<em>egalitarian</em> argument for why \(y\) is better than \(x\): one
factor (the degree of inequality) is improved with \(y\), and the
second factor (overall well-being) remains constant. (See Weirich
1983, justifying a Pigou-Dalton respecting betterness ranking via
pluralist egalitarianism.)</p>

<p>
(2) <em>Parfit</em>. Although Parfit (2000) does not cleanly define
the axiomatic commitments of prioritarianism (let alone use the term
&ldquo;Pigou-Dalton&rdquo;), one can distill an argument for
Pigou-Dalton from his text. The core of the argument is the
distinction between <em>benefits</em> and the <em>moral weight of
benefits</em>. Imagine that Ada is better off in outcome \(y\) than
\(x\), and that Barry is better off in outcome \(y^*\) than \(x^*\).
Assume that the well-being differences are the same; each benefits by
the same amount, in well-being terms. The moral weight of the benefits
need not be the same. In particular, positing that the moral weight of
benefits <em>decreases</em> as individuals become better off is
intuitively plausible. This supposition explains intuitively plausible
departures from utilitarianism (e.g., in Nagel&rsquo;s two-child case,
the decision to benefit the worse-off child); <em>and</em> it does so
without relying on egalitarian reasoning (and thus running afoul of
the Levelling Down Objection).</p>

<p>
(3) <em>Claims Across Outcomes</em>. Matthew Adler (2025) introduces
the claims-across-outcomes framework for arriving at the betterness
ranking. As between any two outcomes, a given individual has a claim
in favor of the outcome in which they are better off (and a null claim
if equally well off). In two-person cases, where one person has a
claim to \(x\) over \(y\), the other to \(y\) over \(x\), and everyone
else is unaffected, the better outcome is the one favored by the
person with the stronger claim. Adler argues that this framework
offers a joint justification of Strong Pareto, Pareto Indifference,
Anonymity and Pigou-Dalton. To see how it argues for Pigou-Dalton,
note that a Pigou-Dalton transfer is a two-person case. Let \(x\) be
the pre-transfer outcome, and \(y\) the post-transfer outcome. The
better-off individual (Iris) in \(x\) has a claim to \(x\) over \(y\),
the worse-off individual (Juan) to \(y\) over \(x\), with everyone
else having null claims. The strength of an individual&rsquo;s claim
may reflect their well-being difference, their starting point
well-being level, or both. In the case at hand, the well-being
differences are the same. If well-being level has <em>any</em> role in
determining claim strength, then it comes into play in this case; and
it does so, specifically, by giving Juan (not Iris) the stronger
claim.</p>

<p>
(4) <em>The Moral Value of Compound States of Affairs</em>. Nils
Holtug (2010, p. 204) has proposed an axiological account, according
to which compound states of affairs, each consisting of the state that
an increase in well-being befalls an individual and the state that
this individual is at a particular well-being level, hold moral value.
The larger the increase in well-being, and the lower the level at
which it falls, the larger this value. In a Pigou-Dalton transfer,
where a fixed sum of well-being is shifted from a better-off person to
a worse-off person, shrinking the distance between them, this
well-being falls at a lower level in the post-transfer outcome than in
the pre-transfer outcome, resulting in an overall increase in moral
value.</p>

<p>
(5) <em>Risk-Weighted Expected Utility Theory</em>. Lara Buchak (2017)
proposes that distributions of well-being across a fixed population of
\(N\) individuals be evaluated using an equiprobability veil of
ignorance. The evaluator conceptualizes a given distribution as giving
them (the evaluator) a \(1/N\) probability of the well-being of each
of the \(N\) individuals. The veil-of-ignorance construct has a long
history in ethics, dating back to Harsanyi (1953, 1955, 1977) and
Rawls (1999). Buchak&rsquo;s twist is to argue that the evaluator
should employ risk-weighted expected utility theory (REU) to evaluate
well-being lotteries, rather than expected utility theory (the
standard normative theory of choice under uncertainty). REU differs
from expected-utility theory by incorporating what Buchak terms a
&ldquo;risk function,&rdquo; which reflects whether the decisionmaker
is &ldquo;risk-avoidant&rdquo; (giving more weight to the possibility
of bad outcomes), &ldquo;risk-seeking,&rdquo; or risk-neutral.</p>

<p>
Buchak argues that the evaluator behind the veil of ignorance should
be risk-avoidant. Given the formal structure of REU, this means that
the evaluator ranks distributions according to a generalized-Gini
rule. Note that the generalized-Gini rule satisfies Pigou-Dalton. Less
formally: a risk-avoidant evaluator, behind the veil of ignorance,
gives greater weight to the possibility of low well-being levels, and
thus favors distribution \(D^*\) over distribution \(D\) if \(D^*\) is
reached from \(D\) by a Pigou-Dalton transfer.</p>

<p>
(6) <em>Retaining Expected Utility Theory but Dropping Bernoulli</em>.
The Bernoulli axiom (see below, Sections 4.2&ndash;4.3) posits that
the ranking of prospects in light of a given person&rsquo;s well-being
conforms to the expected value of that person&rsquo;s well-being.
Although widely adopted in the literature, the Bernoulli axiom might
be dropped. If expected utility theory is retained as the normative
theory of choice under uncertainty (pace Buchak) but Bernoulli is
dropped, two new arguments for extended prioritarianism emerge.
Indeed, these are arguments for <em>prioritarianism</em> specifically
rather than merely for extended prioritarianism. One argument appeals
to John Harsanyi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aggregation Theorem&rdquo;; this
argument is discussed below in Section 4.3. A second argument appeals
to the veil of ignorance, but in a different manner than Buchak; this
argument is discussed below in Section 5.3.</p>

<p>
Arguments (3), (4), (5) and (6) for the Pigou-Dalton principle, like
argument (2), never assign pro tanto moral value to a reduction in
individuals&rsquo; well-being, and thus also avoid the Levelling Down
Objection.</p>

<h3 id="ExtPriPriArgForSepCon">3.2 From Extended Prioritarianism to Prioritarianism: Arguments for Separability and Continuity</h3>

<p>
The prioritarian betterness ranking satisfies Pigou-Dalton
<em>and</em> Separability <em>and</em> Continuity. The arguments above
for Pigou-Dalton are generally <em>consistent</em> with Separability
and Continuity. (The one exception is Buchak&rsquo;s argument,
argument (5), which supports Pigou-Dalton by way of a defense of
generalized-Gini moral betterness, thereby rejecting Separability.)
However, arguments (1), (2), (3), and (4) do not themselves show why
Separability and Continuity should be adopted. To arrive at
prioritarianism using one of these arguments, additional
considerations need to be provided to support Separability and
Continuity.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 Separability</h4>

<p>
(1) <em>Egyptology</em>. Parfit, in <em>Reasons and Persons</em>
(1987), famously offers the following argument against average
utilitarianism (a variable-population extension of utilitarianism,
which violates Separability in the variable-population context).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whether [the birth of a child] would be bad [according to average
utilitarianism] depends on facts about all previous lives. If the
Ancient Egyptians had a very high quality of life, it is more likely
to be bad to have a child now. It is more likely that this
child&rsquo;s birth will lower the average quality of the lives that
are ever lived. But research in Egyptology cannot be relevant to our
decision whether to have children. (p. 420)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This has come to be known as the &ldquo;Egyptology&rdquo; argument for
Separability. It also applies in the fixed-population context. In a
nutshell, the argument is this. Let \(x\) and \(y\) differ with
respect to the well-being of one or more individuals, the affected
individuals. If the betterness ranking violates Separability, it is
possible that how \(x\) morally compares to \(y\) depends upon the
well-being levels of unaffected individuals who are temporally remote
from all of the affected individuals (e.g., some unaffected
individuals lived in ancient Egypt, while the affected individuals
were born after 1900), or spatially remote from all of the affected
individuals (some unaffected individuals live on Mars, while the
affected individuals live on Earth). And this is counterintuitive. See
Table 3, showing specifically how generalized-Gini moral betterness
(which violates Separability) runs afoul of the Egyptology
objection.</p>

(2) <em>Tractability</em>. A betterness ranking of outcomes is
(plausibly) associated with a betterness ranking of
<em>prospects</em>. This prospect ranking encapsulates how the outcome
ranking provides guidance with respect to moral deliberation.
Separability at the level of the outcome ranking is a necessary
condition for the prospect ranking to satisfy the axiom of
<em>Prospect Separability</em>. (See Section 4.2.) Prospect
Separability, in turn, substantially facilitates moral deliberation.
It means that the decisionmaker can ignore individuals who are
<em>sure to be unaffected</em> by the decisionmaker&rsquo;s
choice.</p>

<p>
(3) <em>Claims Across Outcomes</em>. Adler (2012, ch. 5) argues that
the claims-across-outcomes framework supports not only Pigou-Dalton,
but also Separability. Imagine that Jia is better off in outcome \(y\)
than outcome \(x\), and thus has a claim to \(y\) over \(x\).
Rejecting Separability means that the strength of Jia&rsquo;s claim
depends not merely upon her starting-point well-being level (in \(x)\)
and her well-being difference between the two outcomes, but a
<em>further</em> factor: how her well-being compares to the well-being
of unaffected individuals. An affirmative argument for this relational
determinant of claim strength is hard to muster. Granted, the
well-being of unaffected individuals may affect Jia&rsquo;s
<em>well-being</em>. But that impact will be reflected in Jia&rsquo;s
own well-being in the two outcomes. Why unaffected individuals should
determine the <em>claim strength</em> of affected individuals, on top
of (potentially) determining their well-being, is hard to see.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Continuity</h4>

<p>
The discussion of the Continuity axiom in the literature on
prioritarianism has focused, not on the axiom as such (which is a
technical axiom that doesn&rsquo;t elicit strong favorable or
unfavorable intuitions on its own), but on the properties of the
betterness rankings that satisfy or fail this axiom. Within the space
of extended-prioritarian rankings, the main alternatives to
prioritarianism that fail Continuity and that have been considered
thus far in the literature are leximin and PLT. Note that both satisfy
Pigou-Dalton and Separability; the axiomatic difference between these
rankings and prioritarianism is <em>just</em> a matter of the
Continuity axiom.</p>

<p>
Leximin gives absolute priority to every worse-off individual over
every group of better-off individuals. Imagine that Darsh in outcome
\(x\) is worse off than everyone in some group of individuals. In
outcome \(y\), Darsh is worse off than he is in \(x\); everyone in the
group is better off than they are in \(x\); all others are unaffected.
Then leximin <em>necessarily</em> counts \(y\) as worse than
\(x\)&mdash;even if Darsh in \(x\) is only slightly worse off than
those in the group; regardless of how small Darsh&rsquo;s well-being
loss, and how large their gains; and regardless of the size of the
group. This seems implausibly extreme. To make the example more
concrete: imagine that Darsh and everyone in the group suffers a
chronic serious, health condition; Darsh also suffers from
intermittent tension headaches. A pill can be used to prevent
Darsh&rsquo;s headaches from becoming slightly more severe, or to cure
everyone in the group of the health condition. Leximin prefers to use
the pill to prevent Darsh&rsquo;s headaches from becoming slightly
more severe&mdash;which seems implausible enough if there is just one
person in the group, let alone if there are dozens, hundreds, or
thousands.</p>

<p>
PLT does not give absolute priority to a worse-off individual over a
group of better-off individuals if all the individuals are on the same
side of the threshold. But it does do so if the worse-off individual
is below the threshold and the group is above. Again, this may seem
implausible. For example, consider a PLT betterness ranking that sets
the threshold \(w^{\textit{Thresh}}\) at the level of
need-satisfaction: the well-being level of an individual whose basic
needs are satisfied, but has no other positive sources of well-being
in her life. Imagine, now, that Darsh is needy in \(x\). Darsh is
worse off in \(y\) than \(x\); some group of non-needy persons are
better off in \(y\) than \(x.\) PLT necessarily prefers \(x\) to
\(y\)&mdash;even if Darsh is only slightly worse off than those in the
group in \(x\); regardless of how small Darsh&rsquo;s well-being loss,
and how large their gains; and regardless of the size of the
group.</p>

<p>
That said, the absolutism of both leximin and PLT is not a logical
implication of dropping Continuity. More precisely, there are
extended-prioritarian betterness rankings that, like leximin and PLT,
satisfy Separability; that, like them, fail Continuity; but do not
give absolute priority to any individual over a sufficiently large
group of better-off individuals. For example, consider the following
multi-step rule: (1) \(x\) is better than \(y\) if the sum of
transformed well-being in \(x\) is greater than the sum of transformed
well-being in \(y\), using strictly increasing and strictly concave
transformation function \(g(\cdot)\); (2) if \(x\) and \(y\) have
equal sums of \(g(\cdot)\)-transformed well-being, then \(x\) is
better than \(y\) if the sum of transformed well-being in \(x\) is
greater than the sum of transformed well-being in \(y\), using a
<em>different</em> strictly increasing and strictly concave
transformation function \(f(\cdot)\): and (3) if \(x\) and \(y\) are
ranked equally good at both step 1 and step 2, then they are equally
good.</p>

<p>
The substantive attractiveness of such non-absolutist
extended-prioritarian rankings that differ from prioritarianism only
in failing Continuity remains to be investigated.</p>

<h2 id="PriUndUnc">4. Prioritarianism under Uncertainty</h2>

<p>
In decision theory, a standard set-up for representing choice under
uncertainty is the <em>prospect</em> framework. There is a collection
of mutually exclusive &ldquo;states of nature,&rdquo; each assigned a
fixed probability. A given prospect \(P\) associates each
state-of-nature with some outcome. See Table&nbsp;4.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Table 4.</span> <em>Explanation</em>:
\(\pi(s)\) is the probability of a given state <em class="m">s.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
The set of prospects (for a given group of states-of-nature) is an
abstract representation of a decisionmaker&rsquo;s choice situation.
The decisionmaker (Dolores) is <em>uncertain</em> about the features
of the world that determine which outcome would result, for any given
choice available to her. Dolores&rsquo; uncertainty is represented in
the assignment of probabilities to the states-of-nature; the
probability of a state-of-nature represents her degree of belief that
this is the actual state-of-nature. Each choice available to Dolores
corresponds to one or another prospect; the prospect says what the
outcome would be, for each of the states-of-nature to which Dolores
assigns some (nonzero) degree of belief.</p>

<p>
The prospect framework has many applications. The one of interest here
concerns moral axiology. The <em>choice guidance</em> given by a moral
axiology can be systematized in how it ranks prospects. A particular
axiology (betterness ranking of outcomes) does not uniquely determine
a betterness ranking of prospects, but rather is associated with a
plurality of prospect-ranking rules. In selecting between these rules,
we specify what the axiology says to a non-omniscient (e.g., human)
decisionmaker. Economists and philosophers have used the prospect
framework to clarify the choice guidance of various axiologies,
including utilitarianism, prioritarianism, and others. (See, e.g.,
Adler 2022a; Fleurbaey 2010; Mongin and Pivato 2016).</p>

<p>
Momentarily, we&rsquo;ll discuss the various prospect-ranking rules
for a prioritarian axiology. First, however, we consider the proposal
that prioritarian axiology fixes prospect rankings only
indirectly.</p>

<h3 id="Fac">4.1 Factualism</h3>

<p>
A basic distinction, when theorizing choices under uncertainty, is
that between factualism and probabilism. According to factualism,
choices should be morally assessed on the basis of the outcomes to
which they will <em>in fact</em> lead. According to probabilism, on
the other hand, choices should be morally assessed on the basis of the
outcomes to which they <em>can</em> lead and their probabilities (that
is, on the basis of the associated prospects). Probabilist forms of
prioritarianism will be discussed in Section 4.2. Prioritarian
factualism has been defended by Holtug (2019), and essentially claims
that the ranking of choices is determined by the value of the outcomes
to which they will actually lead, where this value is assessed on the
basis of the prioritarian betterness ranking. Thus, if a choice,
\(C\), leads to outcome \(x\), and another choice, \(C^*\), leads to
outcome \(y, C\) is better than \(C^*\) if and only if \(x\) is better
than \(y\) according to that outcome ranking.</p>

<p>
Factualist prioritarianism does not directly inform a decisionmaker
how to make choices under uncertainty, as she will then not know what
the actual outcomes of the available choices are. But factualists
argue that the question of how to make decisions is separate from the
question of the moral rightness of choices, and that the former
question needs to be addressed in terms of a decision procedure (Bales
1971; Hare 1981, ch. 2). The decision procedure we have most reason to
adopt, according to factualist prioritarians, is the procedure that,
if adopted, would best promote the aim of realizing the outcomes that
are highest in the prioritarian ranking. This procedure will include
information about how best to make choices under uncertainty. Once the
prioritarian outcome betterness ranking is fully settled, specifying
the content of the decision procedure will largely rely on empirical
considerations about the aptness of different procedures as regards
realizing the prioritarian aim. Perhaps this procedure implies that
the decisionmaker should sometimes make a choice that maximizes
<em>expected</em> prioritarian value (see the discussion of ex post
prioritarianism below). But, if so, the only reason to maximize
expected value is that we want the value that is <em>in fact</em>
realized to be maximized (Carlson 1995, pp. 20&ndash;25). Thus, aiming
to maximize expected prioritarian value is only an indirect strategy
to realize what ultimately matters, namely the prioritarian value that
is in fact realized. (For critical discussion of factualist
prioritarianism, see Arneson 2022: 60&ndash;62)</p>

<h3 id="PriProRanRul">4.2 Prioritarian Prospect-Ranking Rules</h3>

<p>
As stated, there are also probabilist prioritarian theories. Consider
a prioritarian betterness ranking (for short, \(R)\): the ranking of a
set \(\mathbf{O}\) of outcomes using some strictly increasing and
strictly concave transformation function. For any collection of
states-of-nature (representing a decisionmaker&rsquo;s uncertainty
about the conditions in the world that determine which outcome would
result for each of the choices available to the decisionmaker), there
is a set \(\mathbf{P}\) of prospects. Each prospect \(P\) associates a
state-of-nature with some outcome in \(\mathbf{O}. R\) has a variety
of associated prospect-ranking rules: rules for ranking
\(\mathbf{P}\).</p>

<p>
In what follows, we present prioritarian prospect-ranking rules; we
set forth prospect axioms; and we evaluate the rules in light of the
axioms. For purposes of this discussion, we adopt the following
premise.</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Bernoulli</em>: The ranking of prospects in light of a given
person&rsquo;s well-being tracks that person&rsquo;s expected
well-being. Let Leila be some person and \(P, P^*\) two prospects. (1)
If Leila&rsquo;s expected well-being with \(P\) equals her expected
well-being with \(P^*\), then \(P\) is equally good for Leila as
\(P^*\). (2) If Leila&rsquo;s expected well-being with \(P\) is
greater than her expected well-being with \(P^*\), then \(P\) is
better for Leila than \(P^*\).</p>

<p>
The Bernoulli assumption is regularly adopted in the literature on
moral choice under uncertainty, but is also controverted. The
possibility of dropping Bernoulli is discussed below, in Section
4.3.</p>

<p>
Turn, then, to prioritarian prospect-ranking rules. Three
possibilities are prominent in the literature: &ldquo;ex post
prioritarianism&rdquo; (EPP), &ldquo;ex ante prioritarianism&rdquo;
(EAP), and &ldquo;expected equally distributed equivalent
prioritarianism&rdquo; (EEDEP). (Formal statements of these rules and
the axioms below are given in Adler 2022a; on prioritarianism under
uncertainty, see also Bovens 2015; Fleurbaey 2010; Greaves 2015;
McCarthy 2006, 2008; Otsuka and Voorhoeve 2009, 2018; Parfit 2012;
Rabinowicz 2001). Each approach assigns a score to a given prospect in
a distinctive manner, and ranks \(\mathbf{P}\) according to these
scores:</p>

<p class="indent">
EPP (<em>ex post prioritarianism</em>). The outcome in each
state-of-nature is assigned a &ldquo;moral utility&rdquo; number
equaling the sum of concavely transformed well-being in that outcome.
The prospect is assigned a score equaling its expected outcome utility
(the sum of the outcome utilities, each discounted by the
state&rsquo;s probability). In short, EPP&rsquo;s scoring formula is
the <em>expected sum of concavely transformed well-being</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">
EAP (<em>ex ante prioritarianism</em>). For each individual, their
expected well-being with the prospect is calculated. These expected
well-being values are plugged into the transformation function and
summed. In short, EAP&rsquo;s scoring formula is the <em>sum of
concavely transformed expected well-being</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">
EEDEP (<em>expected equally distributed equivalent
prioritarianism</em>). EEDEP works the same way as EPP, except that
the outcome in each state-of-nature is assigned a different moral
utility: its &ldquo;equally distributed equivalent.&rdquo; The equally
distributed equivalent of an outcome \(x\) is that single well-being
level \(w^*\) which, if had by everyone, has the same prioritarian
value as \(x\). Formally, \(w^*\) is such that \(N \times g(w^*) =
g(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + g(w_N (x))\). In short, EEDEP&rsquo;s scoring
formula is the <em>expected equally distributed equivalent</em>.</p>

<p>
Prospect-ranking rules can be evaluated by means of prospect axioms.
The following axioms bring into view the pros and cons of EPP, EAP,
and EEDEP.</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Expected Utility Decisionmaking</em>. Each outcome should be
assigned a moral utility that is <em>consistent</em> with the
prioritarian betterness ranking \(R\) (higher utility to better
outcomes, equal utility for equally good outcomes). The score of a
prospect is its expected utility, and prospects are ranked according
to these scores.</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>State Dominance</em>. Assume prospects \(P^*\) and \(P\) are such
that, in each state-of-nature, the outcome of \(P^*\) is ranked better
by \(R\) than the outcome of \(P\). If so, \(P^*\) is better than
\(P\).</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Ex Ante Pareto</em>. (i) <em>Ex Ante Pareto Indifference</em>.
Assume that prospect \(P^*\) is equally good for each person as
prospect \(P\). (Given Bernoulli, this condition can be restated as:
each person&rsquo;s expected well-being with \(P^*\) is equal to their
expected well-being with \(P\).) If so, \(P^*\) and \(P\) are equally
good. (ii) <em>Ex Ante Strong Pareto</em>. Assume that prospect
\(P^*\) is at least as good for each person as prospect \(P\), and
strictly better than \(P\) for at least one person. (Given Bernoulli,
this condition can be restated as: each person&rsquo;s expected
well-being with \(P^*\) is greater than or equal to their expected
well-being with \(P\), and at least one person has strictly greater
expected well-being with \(P^*\).) If so, \(P^*\) is better than
\(P\).</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Prospect Separability</em>. Assume that one or more persons are
&ldquo;sure to be unaffected&rdquo; as between prospects \(P\) and
\(P^*\). That is, in each state-of-nature, each person&rsquo;s
well-being with \(P\) is the same as their well-being with \(P^*\). If
so, the \(P/P^*\) ranking is independent of what these state-by-state
levels are.</p>

<p>
Each of these axioms seems quite plausible. In brief, the case for
each is as follows. (1) <em>Expected Utility Decisionmaking</em>.
Expected-utility theory posits axioms sufficient to demonstrate the
existence of a utility function, which conforms to the betterness
ranking of outcomes (one outcome is at least as good as a second if
and only if the utility of the first outcome is at least as large as
the utility of the second outcome), and which is such that the
expectation of outcome-utility tracks choiceworthiness (one choice is
at least as good as a second if and only if the expected utility of
the first choice is at least as large as the expected utility of the
second). (Briggs 2023; Kreps 1998; Gilboa 2009). The axiom on hand,
here, applies expected utility theory to the problem of ranking
choices in light of the <em>moral</em> betterness of outcomes, as per
the prioritarian betterness ranking \(R\). (2) <em>State
Dominance</em>. If one prospect is better than another, whatever the
state-of-nature may be, then surely it is better. (State Dominance is
a logically weaker axiom than Expected Utility Decisionmaking: if a
prospect-ranking rule satisfies the latter, it necessarily satisfies
the former.) (3) <em>Ex Ante Pareto</em>. These axioms can be defended
by appeal to individuals&rsquo; prudential viewpoints (a given
individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;prudential viewpoint&rdquo; is focused on
the well-being of that person). If two prospects \(P^*\) and \(P\)
meet the antecedent condition for Ex Ante Pareto Indifference, then
they are equally good from each individual&rsquo;s prudential
viewpoint. If \(P^*\) and \(P\) meet the antecedent condition for Ex
Ante Strong Pareto, then \(P^*\) is better from at least one
individual&rsquo;s prudential viewpoint, and no worse from
anyone&rsquo;s. Whatever our prospect ranking when prudential
viewpoints conflict, shouldn&rsquo;t we respect those viewpoints
<em>at least</em> in the cases described by these axioms? (4)
<em>Prospect Separability</em>. Assume that some individuals are
causally remote from the decisionmaker. Dolores, the decisionmaker, is
confident that, whatever the state-of-nature, her choice will not
change the well-being of these individuals. This would be true, for
example, of individuals who were born in the past and are already
dead; and perhaps of individuals in sufficiently distant locations
(distant planets). \(\mathbf{P}\) is the set of prospects
corresponding to Dolores&rsquo; choice situation. Each causally remote
individual is sure-to-be-unaffected for all of the prospects in
\(\mathbf{P}\); the individual&rsquo;s well-being in a given state
does not vary with the prospects in \(\mathbf{P}\). <em>If</em> the
prospect-ranking rule satisfies Prospect Separability, the ranking of
the prospects in \(\mathbf{P}\) is the same regardless of the
state-by-state well-being levels of each causally remote individual.
Dolores can therefore ignore the well-being levels of these
individuals in thinking about her choices. This provides a substantial
tractability benefit in decisionmaking.</p>

<p>
A betterness ranking of outcomes has a corresponding prospect-ranking
rule that satisfies Prospect Separability <em>only if</em> the
outcome-ranking rule satisfies Separability. The tractability argument
for Separability (an axiom regarding the outcome ranking) is this: if
the outcome-ranking rule satisfies that axiom, then it can be
implemented under uncertainty via prospect-ranking rules that satisfy
Prospect Separability, with the attendant tractability benefits.</p>

<p>
Table 5 shows how EPP, EAP, and EEDEP fare with respect to these
axioms. As the table shows, none of these three approaches satisfy all
of the axioms.</p>

One striking pattern in Table 5 is that none of these three approaches
satisfy both State Dominance and Ex Ante Pareto. EPP and EEDEP satisfy
State Dominance, at the expense of Ex Ante Pareto; EAP satisfies Ex
Ante Pareto, at the expense of State Dominance. This is not a
coincidence. As Table 6 illustrates, no prospect-ranking rule for
prioritarianism can satisfy both State Dominance and Ex Ante
Pareto.</p>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Table 6.</span> <em>Explanation</em>: In both
Table 6a and 6b, the probability of state <em>s</em> and of state
<em>s*</em> is .5.</p>

<p>
Table 6a shows the conflict between State Dominance and Ex Ante Pareto
Indifference given prioritarian outcome betterness. By Pigou-Dalton,
the outcome in which both individuals receive 50 is better than an
outcome in which one receives 80 and the other 20. Thus, by State
Dominance, prospect \(P+\) is better than prospect \(P\). But Ex Ante
Pareto Indifference requires that the prospects be ranked equally
good.</p>

<p>
Table 6b shows the conflict between State Dominance and Ex Ante Strong
Pareto given prioritarian outcome betterness. For any transformation
function, there is some \(\varepsilon \gt 0\) such that an outcome in
which both individuals receive 50 &ndash; \(\varepsilon\) is ranked
better than an outcome in which one receives 80 and the other 20.
(This is the result of Pigou-Dalton plus Continuity.) Thus, by State
Dominance, prospect \(P''\) is better than prospect \(P'\). But this
violates Ex Ante Strong Pareto.</p>
</div>

<p>
As already noted, a prospect ranking rule that satisfies Expected
Utility Decisionmaking automatically satisfies State Dominance. It
therefore follows from Table 6 that no prospect-ranking rule for
prioritarianism can satisfy both Expected Utility Decisionmaking and
Ex Ante Pareto. EPP and EEDEP satisfy the former axiom but not the
latter; EAP satisfies the latter but not the former.</p>

<p>
In short, in using prioritarianism to provide choice guidance for
decisionmakers operating under uncertainty&mdash;that is, in
constructing a prospect-ranking rule to be paired with the
prioritarian outcome-ranking rule&mdash;there is a tradeoff between,
on the one hand, State Dominance and Expected Utility Decisionmaking;
and, on the other hand, Ex Ante Pareto.</p>

<h3 id="DroBer">4.3 Dropping Bernoulli?</h3>

<p>
The Bernoulli premise&mdash;that the ranking of prospects in light of
a given person&rsquo;s well-being conforms to the expected value of
that person&rsquo;s well-being&mdash;is widely adopted in the
literature on moral choice under uncertainty. See Adler (2019); Broome
(1991); Fleurbaey (2010); Greaves (2017b); Harsanyi (1953, 1955,
1977); McCarthy (2008); Ord (2015); see additional sources cited in
McCarthy (2008, p. 20). But it has also been challenged. See Sen
(1976), Weymark (1991).</p>

<p>
In understanding Bernoulli, it is important to keep in mind that
we&rsquo;re working with well-being numbers that represent well-being
levels and differences. Bernoulli says that the numbers play a
<em>third</em> role: they also expectationally represent well-being
comparisons of prospects. For example, assume that, with prospect
\(P\), Leila gets well-being level \(w\) for certain. With prospect
\(P^*\), she has a 50% chance of getting \(w^+\), and a 50% chance of
getting \(w^-\). Assume that \(w^+ \gt w \gt w^-\). Moreover, \(w^+ -
w = w - w^- = \Delta w\). That is, with \(P^*\) Leila gets a 50%
chance of doing better than well-being level \(w\) by amount \(\Delta
w\), and a 50% chance of doing worse than well-being level \(w\) by
the same amount \(\Delta w\).</p>

<p>
If Bernoulli holds true, the two prospects are equally good for Leila:
the well-being she gets from \(P\) is \(w\), and her expected
well-being from \(P^*\) equals .\(5(w + \Delta w) + .5(w - \Delta w) =
w\). But why suppose that the prospects <em>are</em> equally good for
Leila? Perhaps the prospect ranking in light of Leila&rsquo;s
well-being is such that: a chance of gaining \(\Delta w\) counts for
less than an equal chance of losing \(\Delta w\). If so, \(P^*\) is
worse than \(P\) for Leila, not equally good. Alternatively, perhaps
the prospect ranking in light of Leila&rsquo;s well-being is such
that: a chance of gaining \(\Delta w\) counts for more than an equal
chance of losing \(\Delta w\). If so, \(P^*\) is better than \(P\) for
Leila, not equally good.</p>

<p>
The debate about Bernoulli implicates difficult and contested issues
in well-being measurement. We lack space to engage those issues here.
What we <em>will</em> point out is how dropping Bernoulli changes the
axiomatic comparison of EPP, EAP, and EEDEP. We&rsquo;ll assume that
the ranking of prospects in light of individual \(i\)&rsquo;s
well-being conforms to the expected value of some function
\(h(\cdot)\) of individual \(i\)&rsquo;s well-being, with \(h(\cdot)\)
strictly increasing. Bernoulli supposes that \(h(\cdot)\) is the
identity function or any other linear function; with Bernoulli
dropped, \(h(\cdot)\) is non-linear, e.g., strictly concave, strictly
convex, or some other non-linear
 form.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Now let us suppose that Bernoulli is dropped <em>and</em>, more
specifically, that \(h(\cdot)\) is the very same function as the
prioritarian transformation function \(g(\cdot)\). If so, EPP
satisfies <em>all</em> of the prospect axioms discussed above:
Expected Utility Decisionmaking <em>and</em> State Dominance
<em>and</em> Ex Ante Pareto <em>and</em> Prospect Separability. EAP
has the same axiomatic properties as with
 Bernoulli.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 EEDEP continues to satisfy Expected Utility Decisionmaking and State
Dominance, but no longer satisfies Ex Ante Pareto even with
individuals identically situated.</p>

<p>
Note that, if prioritarianism is justified by way of Harsanyi&rsquo;s
Aggregation Theorem plus the rejection of Bernoulli, \(h(\cdot)\) and
\(g(\cdot)\) will indeed be the
 same.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Alternatively, if Bernoulli is dropped but \(h(\cdot)\) is different
from \(g(\cdot)\), the axiomatic properties of EPP remain as stated in
Table 5 (which assumes Bernoulli), as do the axiomatic properties of
EAP. EEDEP satisfies Expected Utility Decisionmaking and State
Dominance but not Ex Ante Pareto even with individuals identically
situated.</p>

<p>
In short, dropping Bernoulli strengthens the axiomatic case for EPP as
against EEDEP, and strengthens the axiomatic case for EPP as against
EAP if \(g(\cdot)\) is the same as \(h(\cdot)\).</p>

<h2 id="UtiChaPri">5. Utilitarian Challenges to Prioritarianism</h2>

<h3 id="UtiPriDis">5.1 Are Utilitarianism and Prioritarianism Distinct?</h3>

<p>
It has been questioned whether prioritarianism is genuinely distinct
from utilitarianism (Broome 1991, ch. 10; 2015). Unlike the
utilitarian arguments described below&mdash;which concede that
prioritarianism and utilitarianism are different, but contend that
prioritarianism is flawed&mdash;this line of argument denies that
prioritarianism is a genuine alternative to utilitarianism in the
first place.</p>

<p>
The argument runs as follows. For a given set of outcomes
\(\mathbf{O}\), using well-being measure \(w(\cdot)\), utilitarianism
assigns each outcome \(x\) a score equaling \(w_1 (x) + \ldots + w_N
(x)\), and ranks outcomes according to these scores. Prioritarianism
selects a concave transformation function \(g(\cdot)\); assigns each
outcome \(x\) a score equaling \(g(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + g(w_N (x))\);
and ranks outcomes according to <em>these</em> scores. At this point,
we can construct a new well-being measure \(w^*(\cdot)\), which
assigns well-being numbers to individuals in outcomes as follows: for
each individual \(i\) and outcome \(x\), \(w_i^*(x) = g(w_i (x))\). In
short, the well-being number for each individual-outcome pair using
this new well-being measure, \(w^*(\cdot)\), is equal to its concavely
transformed well-being number using the old well-being measure,
\(w(\cdot)\).</p>

<p>
But it follows that the &ldquo;prioritarian&rdquo; ranking of outcomes
according to the score \(g(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + g(w_N (x))\) is
identical to the utilitarian ranking using the score \(w_1^*(x)) +
\ldots + w_N^*(x)\). Thus prioritarianism is nothing other than a kind
of utilitarianism.</p>

<p>
The prioritarian can answer this argument as follows: the original
well-being measure \(w(\cdot)\) and the new well-being measure
\(w^*(\cdot)\) are <em>distinct.</em> In particular, they disagree in
how they make intra- and interpersonal comparisons of well-being
differences (Adler 2022a, pp. 81&ndash;83). A welfarist ranking of
outcomes with respect to moral betterness&mdash;whether the ranking is
utilitarian, prioritarian, sufficientist, generalized-Gini,
etc.&mdash;builds <em>upon</em> an account of well-being and an
accompanying well-being measure. The account of well-being and
well-being measure should not be &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; to match the
moral ranking (as is occurring with \(w^*(\cdot)\) above), but should
be specified independently of the moral ranking. Indeed, it should be
independently plausible as a measure of <em>well-being</em>. Relative
to any such independently specified measure \(w(\cdot)\),
utilitarianism and prioritarianism <em>are</em> different: the
moral-betterness ranking produced with the score \(w_1 (x) + \ldots +
w_N (x)\) need <em>not</em> be the same as the ranking produced with
the score \(g(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + g(w_N (x))\).</p>

<h3 id="ExAntPar">5.2 Ex Ante Pareto</h3>

<p>
A powerful utilitarian argument against prioritarianism, with
intellectual roots in Harsanyi&rsquo;s Aggregation Theorem (Harsanyi
1955; Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson 2005, ch. 7; Broome 1991;
Mongin and Pivato 2016; Weymark 1991), is that prioritarianism under
uncertainty runs afoul of the Ex Ante Pareto axiom (Ex Ante Pareto
Indifference and Ex Ante Strong Pareto), while utilitarianism does
not. Or, more precisely, among prioritarian theories, factualism, EPP,
and EEDEP run afoul of it, whereas EAP does not. (See Broome 1991 for
a defense of utilitarianism grounded in the Ex Ante Pareto axiom.)</p>

<p>
To see the issues here, consider prospect-ranking rules associated
with utilitarian outcome betterness. Various possibilities exist, but
one is dominant in the literature: For short, let&rsquo;s call this
&ldquo;simple utilitarianism&rdquo; (SU). SU: The outcome in each
state-of-nature is assigned a &ldquo;moral utility&rdquo; number
equaling the sum of well-being in that outcome. The prospect is
assigned a score equaling its expected outcome utility (the sum of the
outcome utilities, each discounted by the state&rsquo;s probability).
In short, SU&rsquo;s scoring formula is the <em>expected sum of
well-being</em>.</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll assume, for now, that the Bernoulli premise is adopted:
the ranking of prospects in light of a given person&rsquo;s well-being
tracks that person&rsquo;s expected well-being. (See Sections
4.2&ndash;4.3.) What happens if Bernoulli is dropped is discussed at
the end of this section (six paragraphs below). The analysis until
then presupposes Bernoulli.</p>

<p>
The axiomatic properties of SU are stated in Table 7. This table (a
companion to Table 5) clarifies why SU is the dominant
prospect-ranking rule for utilitarianism. It satisfies <em>all</em> of
the uncertainty axioms mentioned above, while EPP, EAP, and EEDEP each
succeed in only satisfying some of them.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">

<p class="center">

</div>

<p>
The reader may be puzzled that SU satisfies both State Dominance and
Ex Ante Pareto. Didn&rsquo;t Table 6 demonstrate that these axioms
can&rsquo;t both be satisfied by a prospect-ranking rule? The answer
is that what State Dominance requires <em>depends</em> on the
outcome-ranking rule. Imagine that there are two states-of-nature and
two individuals, Ya and Zeke. In one state, prospect \(P\) leads to an
outcome in which Ya has well-being 81 and Zeke 25; in the other state,
prospect \(P\) leads to an outcome in which Ya has well-being 25 and
Zeke 81. The outcome of prospect \(P^*\) in both states is an outcome
in which Ya has well-being 50 and Zeke has well-being 50. State
Dominance given the utilitarian outcome-ranking rule requires that
\(P\) be preferred to \(P^* (81 + 25 = 25 + 81 \gt 50 + 50)\). By
contrast, consider a prioritarian outcome-ranking rule using the
square root transformation function. State Dominance given this
<em>prioritarian</em> outcome-ranking rule requires that \(P^*\) be
preferred to \(P\) \((\sqrt{81} + \sqrt{25} \lt \sqrt{50} +
\sqrt{50})\).</p>

<p>
In short, a prospect-ranking rule <em>for prioritarian outcome
betterness</em> can&rsquo;t satisfy both State Dominance and Ex Ante
Pareto, or both Expected Utility Decisionmaking and Ex Ante Pareto, as
shown by Table 6. By contrast, a prospect-ranking rule <em>for
utilitarian outcome betterness can</em> satisfy Expected Utility
Decisionmaking <em>and</em> State Dominance <em>and</em> Ex Ante
Pareto. This fact in turn fuels the utilitarian critique of
prioritarianism. For those who are generally attracted to expected
utility theory as a normative framework for decision, Expected Utility
Decisionmaking (which, again, applies that framework to the specific
case of moral choice-guidance) will seem quite plausible. Even if one
rejects expected utility theory, State Dominance is surely compelling.
But Ex Ante Pareto also has strong normative force. Prioritarian
outcome-betterness forces a tradeoff between these uncertainty axioms;
utilitarian outcome-betterness does not.</p>

<p>
How prioritarianism responds to this critique depends upon whether
factualism is adopted. In their ranking of choices, factualist
prioritarians reject both Expected Utility Decisionmaking and Ex Ante
Pareto (but not State Dominance). As regards Ex Ante Pareto, its force
derives from the fact that it seems to respect the prudential
viewpoints of individuals. Here, betterness from a given prudential
viewpoint is measured in terms of the individual&rsquo;s expected
well-being. However, factualists argue that just as what ultimately
matters in the case of moral value is the moral value that is in fact
realized, what ultimately matters in the case of prudential value is
the prudential value that is in fact realized. Therefore, Ex Ante
Pareto misconstrues the prudential viewpoints of individuals.</p>

<p>
If factualism is not adopted, the prioritarian can respond as follows.
First, the tradeoff between Expected Utility Decisionmaking/State
Dominance and Ex Ante Pareto is not limited to prioritarian outcome
rankings. Harsanyi&rsquo;s Aggregation Theorem shows that <em>every
non-utilitarian outcome ranking</em> faces a tradeoff between Expected
Utility Decisionmaking and Ex Ante Pareto; no such outcome ranking has
a prospect ranking that satisfies both. Further, it can be shown
(indeed, can be seen from Table 6) that <em>every
Pigou-Dalton-respecting outcome ranking</em> faces a tradeoff between
State Dominance and Ex Ante Pareto; no such outcome ranking has a
prospect ranking that satisfies both. (See Adler 2019 for more
detail.) In a nutshell, the tradeoffs here are the inevitable result
of injecting a concern for equity into outcome betterness (in the form
of Pigou-Dalton). Utilitarianism avoids the tradeoffs, but at the cost
of violating <em>this</em> very plausible axiom at the outcome
level.</p>

<p>
What happens, now, if Bernoulli is dropped? The ranking of prospects
in light of individual \(i\)&rsquo;s well-being conforms to the
expected value of some function \(h(\cdot)\) of individual
\(i\)&rsquo;s well-being, with \(h(\cdot)\) strictly increasing but
non-linear. <em>If</em> \(h(\cdot)\) is identical to the prioritarian
transformation function \(g(\cdot)\), the axiomatic comparison of SU
relative to EPP changes dramatically. SU still satisfies Expected
Utility Decisionmaking, State Dominance, and Prospect Separability,
but now violates Ex Ante Pareto; EPP satisfies all four of the
prospect axioms, including Ex Ante Pareto. If \(h(\cdot)\) is
different from \(g(\cdot)\), EPP fares the same way as SU vis a vis
those prospect axioms, i.e., they both satisfy Expected Utility
Decisionmaking, State Dominance, and Prospect Separability, but not Ex
Ante Pareto.</p>

<p>
In short, dropping Bernoulli neutralizes the case for utilitarianism
based on Ex Ante Pareto.</p>

<h3 id="VeiIgn">5.3 Veil of Ignorance</h3>

<p>
Harsanyi famously made two distinct arguments in favor of
utilitarianism. One is the Aggregation Theorem, mentioned above. The
second is his veil-of-ignorance argument (Harsanyi 1953, 1955, 1977;
Weymark 1991). Let each outcome be conceptualized as an
equiprobability lottery over the well-being levels of the \(N\)
individuals in the outcome. If the evaluator complies with expected
utility theory and if the Bernoulli premise holds true, then the
&ldquo;veil of ignorance&rdquo; value assigned to a given outcome
\(x\)&mdash;the value assigned to \(x\) conceptualized as this
equiprobability lottery&mdash;is just \((1/N) w_1 (x) +\ldots (1/N)
w_i (x) + \ldots + (1/N) w_N (x)\). But the ranking of outcomes
according to these veil-of-ignorance values is, obviously, the same as
the utilitarian ranking.</p>

<p>
One response to Harsanyi&rsquo;s defense of utilitarianism, pressed by
Buchak (2017), is to argue that outcomes conceptualized as
equiprobability lotteries should be valued using risk-weighed expected
utility theory (REU), not expected utility theory. See Section 3.1.
However this response does not offer a defense of prioritarianism
(assuming Buchak is correct that REU plus the veil of ignorance leads
to generalized-Gini betterness).</p>

<p>
A second response is to agree with Harsansyi in conceptualizing
outcomes as equiprobability lotteries over well-being levels, and to
agree with him in adopting expected utility theory, but to reject
Bernoulli. This will yield prioritarianism <em>if</em> the
\(h(\cdot)\) function is not merely strictly increasing but strictly
concave. With Bernoulli dropped, the veil-of-ignorance value assigned
to a given outcome \(x\) becomes: \((1/N) h(w_1 (x)) + \ldots + (1/N)
h(w_N (x))\). Clearly, this is the same as a prioritarian ranking if,
but only if, \(h(\cdot)\) is both strictly increasing and strictly
concave.</p>

<p>
The third and most emphatic response, which is consistent with both
expected utility theory and Bernoulli, is simply to deny that the veil
of ignorance is the appropriate mode of justification for outcome
betterness. (Moreno-Ternero and Roemer 2008). Note that arguments (1),
(2), (3), and (4) in Section 3.1 each defend a non-utilitarian
betterness ranking by appealing to some mode of justification other
than the veil of ignorance.</p>

<h3 id="DifCom">5.4 Difference Comparison</h3>

<p>
Consider the following transfer axiom (&ldquo;Difference
Comparison&rdquo;): In any two-person case such that one person is
better off in \(x\) than \(y\) by \(\Delta w\), and the other in \(y\)
than \(x\) by \(\Delta w^*\), with everyone else unaffected, \(x\) is
at least as good as \(y\) if and only if \(\Delta w \ge\) \(\Delta
w^*\). This is a competing transfer axiom to Pigou-Dalton. It can be
shown that a welfarist outcome ranking that satisfies Difference
Comparison must be utilitarian. (Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson
2002, p. 568). For those who find this axiom more intuitive than
Pigou-Dalton, it provides a direct argument for utilitarianism.</p>

<h2 id="EgaChaPri">6. Egalitarian Challenges to Prioritarianism</h2>

<h3 id="ComFaiLevDow">6.1 Comparative Fairness and Levelling Down</h3>

<p>
Larry Temkin has posed a number of challenges to prioritarianism. Some
of these challenges involve a rejection of welfarism, but for present
purposes, the welfarist framework is taken for granted and so the
focus is on challenges that can be raised within this framework.
Temkin provides an account of egalitarianism that is based on
individual claims (or, in Temkin&rsquo;s terminology,
&ldquo;complaints&rdquo;). This is a claims-within-outcomes account
that differs from the claims-across-outcomes account presented above
in Section 3.1, in that it construes claims as being internal to
individual outcomes. Outcomes are to be ranked in terms of how
individuals fare vis-&agrave;-vis each other in each of them, more
specifically as regards their claims to an equal share of well-being
(Temkin 1993, ch. 2). Claims thus construed express a concern with
what Temkin calls &ldquo;comparative fairness&rdquo; (Temkin 2003, p.
62). Unlike prioritarianism, Temkin&rsquo;s egalitarianism is
comparative in the sense that it allows individual claims to depend on
the well-being of others. This also means that Temkin rejects
Separability.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Temkin does not consider the rejection of Separability
objectionable. Consider his two cases of space travelers who are in a
position to divert a mineral-rich asteroid to a planet where the
inhabitants will benefit from the minerals (Temkin 2003, pp.
69&ndash;70). In the first case, these inhabitants are much better off
than people on other planets. In the second case, they are much worse
off than people on other planets. People on the receiving planet are
equally well off in the two cases and the increase in well-being due
to the asteroid is also the same. Since prioritarianism satisfies
Separability, it implies that the well-being of people on other
planets is irrelevant, as these will not be affected, when determining
the moral value of diverting the asteroid. However, Temkin argues that
this is implausible and that, indeed, the space travelers should be
willing to make a larger personal sacrifice to divert the asteroid
insofar as the inhabitants on the receiving planet are worse off than
everyone else in the universe.</p>

<p>
One way for prioritarians to respond is to agree that there is a
difference between the two cases but insist that it does not pertain
to a difference in the moral value of benefiting people on the
receiving planet (who are equally well off and benefit equally in the
two cases). Rather, prioritarians may believe there is reason to
regret that, in the first case, it is not possible to divert the
asteroid towards another planet where the benefits will accrue to
people who are at lower absolute levels of well-being.</p>

<p>
Temkin also challenges a particular reason prioritarians sometimes
invoke for preferring prioritarianism to egalitarianism, namely the
Levelling Down Objection (see Section 2). Temkin (1993, ch. 9) argues
that this objection relies for its plausibility on a person-affecting
account of moral value. In one version, which endorses what might be
called the &ldquo;narrow person-affecting principle&rdquo;, it is
claimed that an outcome, \(x\), cannot be in any respect better (or
worse) than another outcome, \(y\), unless there is someone for whom
\(x\) is better (or worse) than \(y\). Thus, the reason we may be
tempted to think that a levelled down outcome cannot be in any respect
better is that it is better for no one.</p>

<p>
However, Temkin thinks we should reject the narrow person-affecting
principle. He offers several reasons for rejecting that principle,
including one that is consistent with welfarism: the non-identity
problem. Suppose that, for whatever reason, a woman may now conceive a
child whose life will be fairly bad (indeed, only barely worth
living). If she waits a couple of months, she will instead conceive
another child, who will have a happy life. No one else, including the
woman, will have their well-being impacted by her choice. According to
the narrow person-affecting principle, we cannot claim that the
outcome in which she has the unhappy child is worse than the outcome
in which she has the happy child, because the former outcome is not
worse for the unhappy child (who has a positive, although low level of
well-being), nor is it worse for the happy child (who then does not
exist). But this implication of the narrow person-affecting principle
seems wrong.</p>

<p>
Here are two responses prioritarians can make to Temkin&rsquo;s
challenge (Holtug 2010, pp. 181&ndash;200). First, they can deny that
the Levelling Down Objection is based on a person-affecting account of
moral value. Even if such an account is rejected, levelling-down cases
reveal that our distributive concerns are not well captured by
egalitarianism&mdash;or so it may be argued. For example, are those
concerns well captured by the supposition that outcome \(x\) in which
well-being levels are (1, 1, 5, 5) is in one respect better than
outcome \(y\) in which the levels are (3, 7, 10, 15)? Counting \(x\)
as better in one respect seems to ignore the plight of the worse off,
surely the core of distributive justice, who are much worse off in
\(x\) than \(y\).</p>

<p>
Second, prioritarians may endorse a person-affecting account of moral
value but argue that it should be expressed in the form of a wide
rather than a narrow person-affecting principle (for the distinction
between wide and narrow person-affecting principles, see Parfit 1987,
pp. 393&ndash;401). According to a particular wide
person&ndash;affecting principle, an outcome, \(x\), cannot be in any
respect better (or worse) than another outcome, \(y\), if, were \(x\)
to obtain, there would be no one for whom \(x\) was better (or worse)
than \(y\) and, were \(y\) to obtain, there would be no one for whom
\(y\) was worse (or better) than \(x\). On the assumption that it can
be better (or worse) for an individual to exist than never to exist,
this principle implies that in the non-identity problem, it may well
be worse for the woman to have the unhappy child because, were she to
have the happy child instead, that would be better for <em>this</em>
child (for defenses of this assumption, see Arrhenius and Rabinowicz
2015; Bradley 2013; Holtug 2015a; Johansson 2010; Persson 1997, and
for criticism, Broome 1993; Bykvist 2007; McMahan 2013; Parfit 1987).
Like the narrow principle, the wide principle implies that it cannot
be in any respect better to level down.</p>

<p>
Note also that the claims-across-outcomes framework (see Section 3.1)
aims to make precise a person-affecting account of moral value.</p>

<h3 id="PruJusComCla">6.2 Prudential Justification and Competing Claims</h3>

<p>
A further egalitarian challenge to prioritarianism is due to Michael
Otsuka and Alex Voorhoeve (Otsuka and Voorhoeve 2009, 2018; Otsuka
2015). More specifically, they raise two objections, namely the
prudential justification objection and the competing claims objection.
Consider first the prudential justification objection. Suppose Anandi
will (equiprobably) develop a slight or a severe impairment and she
needs to be treated before we know which. The treatment for the slight
impairment is a bit more efficient as regards Anandi&rsquo;s
well-being, where her well-being levels are represented in Table
8.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break wide">

<table class="cell-center cellpad-med-dense centered hrulesTH vert-top">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th><em>Anandi&nbsp;develops
<br />

  <td>2</td>
  <td>10</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Table 8.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Assume again square root as the prioritarian transformation function.
Then, according to EPP, we should ascribe the following values to the
two possible treatments:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
\tag*{A.} (0.5 \times \sqrt{4}) + (0.5 \times \sqrt{7}) &amp;= 2.323 \\
 \tag*{B.} (0.5 \times \sqrt{2}) + (0.5 \times \sqrt{10}) &amp;= 2.288 
\end{align}\]

<p>
Therefore, it is better to treat for the severe than for the slight
impairment. However, according to Otsuka and Voorhoeve, this ignores
that there is a prudential justification for treating for the slight
impairment, namely that this would maximize Anandi&rsquo;s expected
well-being (see also McCarthy 2008, pp. 19&ndash;22; Ord 2015). In
fact, the claim that Anandi should be treated for the severe
impairment violates Ex Ante Pareto (assuming Bernoulli, see Section
4.2; our discussion in this section assumes Bernoulli). Otsuka and
Voorhoeve suggest that prioritarianism applies to single-person cases
a principle that is appropriate only for multi-person cases.</p>

<p>
Next, consider the competing claims objection. Compare the case of
Anandi to the case of Bernard and Chimwala. Unlike the former case,
the latter does not involve uncertainty. Rather, Bernard will develop
the severe impairment and Chimwala the slight impairment. Furthermore,
a treatment for the severe impairment will raise Bernard&rsquo;s
well-being from 2 to 4, and a treatment for the slight impairment will
raise Chimwala&rsquo;s well-being from 7 to 10 (thus, their well-being
levels match those of Anandi regarding the two different impairments
she may develop). The prioritarian outcome ranking implies that it is
better to treat Bernard for his severe impairment than to treat
Chimwala for her slight impairment. Indeed, EPP implies
&lsquo;symmetrical balancing&rsquo; in these two cases in the sense
that it is better to treat Bernard than to treat Chimwala if and only
if it is better to treat Anandi for the severe than for the slight
impairment. However, this means that prioritarians do not assign any
independent significance to the fact that Bernard and Chimwala have
<em>competing claims</em>. On this basis, Otsuka and Voorhoeve argue
that prioritarianism violates the separateness of persons.</p>

<p>
Egalitarianism, on the other hand, is not vulnerable to either the
prudential justification or the competing claims objection. Since it
applies only to relations between individuals, it is silent on the
ranking of prospects in single-person cases, such as the case of
Anandi. Thus, it allows that single-person cases should be settled on
the basis of the relevant person&rsquo;s expected well-being. This
also means that in the case of Bernard and Chimwala, egalitarianism
implies that a moral concern enters the picture that is not present in
the case of Anandi, which is due to the fact that Bernard is <em>worse
off than</em> Chimwala and therefore has a stronger claim to being
treated for his impairment.</p>

<p>
The prudential justification objection applies only to EPP, not to
EAP, EEDEP, or factualist prioritarianism. Since EAP applies the
prioritarian transformation function to individual expected well-being
and renders moral value an increasing function of such well-being, it
implies that in single-person cases the moral ranking will always
coincide with the prudential ranking that is based on the
person&rsquo;s expected well-being. EEDEP also coincides with the
prudential ranking in single-person cases. As regards factualist
prioritarianism, it implies that Anandi should be treated for the
impairment she will in fact develop, which is also what is implied by
factualist prudence. More generally, there is no gap in single-person
cases between factualist prioritarianism and factualist prudence
(which, according to factualists, is the form of prudence that
ultimately matters). (For further discussion, including of whether and
if so how the prudential justification objection applies to a
factualist prioritarian decision-procedure, see Holtug 2019.)</p>

<p>
Various prioritarian responses to the prudential justification
objection to EPP have been proposed (for discussion, see Bognar 2012;
Crisp 2011; Holtug 2019; Hyams 2015; O&rsquo;Neill 2012; Ord 2015;
Parfit 2012; Porter 2012; Rendall 2013; Segall 2015; Williams 2012).
Here, we mention four. First, it has been argued that EPP should be
seen as a conflict resolution principle, which applies only to
interpersonal conflicts in well-being, and so not to single-person
cases (Adler and Holtug 2019, p. 21; Williams 2012, p. 324). Second,
Parfit (2012) proposed a hybrid principle, which includes both EPP and
EAP, in response to the challenges posed by Otsuka and Voorhoeve.
Third, it has been proposed that the implications of EPP in
single-person cases simply do not serve to undermine this principle.
Otsuka and Voorhoeve suggest that the prioritarian transformation
function is inappropriate in single-person cases, but prioritarians
may argue otherwise. To illustrate, consider a particular child,
Friedrich, who might have either of two possible futures. In one
possible outcome, \(x\), Friedrich will be quite badly off, but
nevertheless enjoys a particular benefit, \(B\) (which improves his
well-being by, say, 5 units of well-being). In another possible
outcome, \(y\), Friedrich will be quite well off and also enjoys this
particular benefit, \(B\) (again, increasing his well-being by 5
units). Prioritarians may suggest that it is both intuitive and quite
appropriate to apply the prioritarian transformation function to this
single-person case and on this basis claim that \(B\) contributes more
moral value in \(x\) than in \(y\), because in the outcome in which he
is worse off, it is morally more urgent to benefit Friedrich (Holtug
2021, pp. 396&ndash;399). Finally, to the extent reservations about
the claim that Anandi should be treated for the severe impairment are
due to Ex Ante Pareto, it is worth pointing out that ex post
egalitarianism likewise violates this principle (although not in
single-person cases). And so Ex Ante Pareto does not, as such, provide
a reason to favor egalitarianism over prioritarianism.</p>

<p>
Regarding the competing claims objection, there are different ways in
which prioritarians may respond. If they consider prioritarianism a
conflict resolution principle, they can argue that there is a
particular moral concern that applies only to the case of Bernard and
Chimwala, not to the case of Anandi, and it involves weighing up their
competing claims. In other words, with this revision, the prioritarian
only applies the prioritarian transformation function to multi-person
cases. Alternatively, or in addition, prioritarians may invoke the
claims-across-outcomes framework outlined above (Section 3.1). They
can then argue that Bernard has a stronger claim to being treated than
Chimwala because, although Chimwala would benefit more, the benefit to
Bernard falls at a lower level of well-being. On this line of
reasoning, prioritarianism will not be insensitive to competing
claims&mdash;rather, it will be built upon them. Of course, the
prioritarian account of competing claims is different from an
egalitarian account, because the prioritarian account satisfies
Separability. This means that the size of each individual&rsquo;s
claim is independent of the well-being of others (where these
independent claims are then balanced against each other to arrive at
the overall prioritarian ranking). As we have seen above,
prioritarians tend to consider Separability an independently
attractive condition for a distributive principle to satisfy.</p>

<h2 id="SufChaPri">7. Sufficientist Challenges to Prioritarianism</h2>

<p>
Sufficientism was expressed as a betterness ranking in Section 1.1.
This statement of sufficientism, which will be our focus here, is
based upon Crisp (2003). See Shields (2020); Bossert, Cato, and Kamaga
(2022), for a survey of alternative versions.</p>

<p>
Sufficientism differs from prioritarianism in two respects. Both arise
from its use of a well-being threshold. First, sufficientism accords
absolute priority to those below the threshold, over those above. PLT
has the very same feature. Section 3.2.2 described and criticized this
feature of PLT; the same criticisms apply to sufficientism.</p>

<p>
Second, above the threshold, equal increases in well-being have equal
moral value (and so above the threshold, sufficientism coincides with
utilitarianism). Sufficientists argue that when a certain level of
well-being has been reached, priority gives out. For example, assuming
for simplicity that their well-being matches their wealth, we should
not care about inequalities between the rich and the super-rich (Crisp
2003; Frankfurt 1987). Above the threshold, as long as the sum of
well-being remains constant, we should be indifferent to how it is
distributed.</p>

<p>
Axiomatically, this second feature of sufficientism corresponds to a
violation of the Pigou-Dalton axiom with respect to above-threshold
transfers. Consider a sufficientist betterness ranking with
\(w^\textit{Thresh}\) as its well-being threshold, as compared to a
PLT ranking with the very same threshold and to prioritarianism.
Assume that in \(x\) Fei and Gerry are both better off than
\(w^\textit{Thresh}\), with Fei better off than Gerry. In \(y\)
Fei&rsquo;s well-being has decreased by \(\Delta w\), Gerry&rsquo;s
has increased by \(\Delta w\), the gap between them has decreased
(thus both remain above \(w^\textit{Thresh}\)), and no one else is
affected. Then Pigou-Dalton requires that \(y\) be ranked better than
\(x\); PLT and prioritarianism will do so, while sufficientism
considers the two outcomes to be equally good.</p>

<p>
There are different ways in which the sufficientist can motivate the
rejection of Pigou-Dalton above the sufficiency threshold. Crisp
(2003, p. 758) makes a proposal that simultaneously fixes the
threshold <em>and</em> provides an explanation of why Pigou-Dalton no
longer applies once it has been met. Thus, according to Crisp,
\(w^\textit{Thresh}\) is the level at which compassion sets out. Along
such lines, we feel compassion for the poor, giving them priority over
the rich, but we do not feel compassion for the rich and so do not
feel inclined to give them priority over the super-rich.</p>

<p>
Prioritarians can respond to this argument in either of two ways. They
can argue that compassion is not a reliable guide to distributive
justice. Or they can argue that, even on the assumption that
compassion is a reliable guide, there is no level at which compassion
gives out, motivating a departure from Pigou-Dalton. Let us assume
that the sufficientist will want to set \(w^\textit{Thresh}\) at a
relatively high level, such as to render plausible the claim that
compassion gives out above that level. And assume, for simplicity,
that well-being is directly proportional to life-length and that, at
any given point in time at which they are alive, everyone will have
the same level of well-being. Now compare two outcomes, \(x\) and
\(y\). In \(x\), half the population lives three times as long as the
other half of the population (say, respectively, 300 years and 100
years) and the first half of the population obtains a well-being level
of \(3w^\textit{Thresh}\) whereas the second half obtains only a level
of \(w^\textit{Thresh}\). In \(y\), life-length and therefore
well-being is distributed equally between the groups, such that
everyone lives 200 years and obtains a well-being level of
\(2w^\textit{Thresh}\). Thus, we can move from \(x\) to \(y\) through
a series of Pigou-Dalton transfers. Prioritarians can now argue that,
intuitively, \(y\) is better than \(x\) (Holtug 2010, pp.
233&ndash;235). And that, indeed, everything else being equal, we
would have reason to choose \(y\) over \(x\), if for example we were
able to distribute some life-prolonging drug equally \((y)\) rather
than unequally \((x)\). This may suggest that compassion does not give
out and that there is no threshold above which Pigou-Dalton ceases to
apply. (For further critical discussion of sufficientism, see for
example Casal 2007.)</p>

<h2 id="VarPop">8. Variable Population</h2>

<p>
Outcomes can vary regarding both the identities and the number of
individuals that exist in them. Since the most complex and troubling
problems in population ethics concern different-number comparisons,
these will also be in focus here. Prioritarians might claim that
prioritarianism applies only to same-number comparisons. Along such
lines, Parfit (2004, p. 257) at one point suggested
&ldquo;quarantining&rdquo; different-number comparisons, because of
the sort of problems that arise for distributive principles when
applied to such comparisons. Specifically with respect to
prioritarianism he said that it &ldquo;cannot be applied to cases in
which, in the different possible outcomes, different people would
exist. When we consider these cases, we need other principles&rdquo;
(Parfit 2012, p. 440; for criticism, see Otsuka 2022; Segall 2022). In
this Section, however, the focus will be on the implications of
prioritarianism insofar as it is applied to different-number
comparisons.</p>

<p>
Various distributive principles, including total utilitarianism, imply
what Parfit dubbed the Repugnant Conclusion: &ldquo;For any possible
population of at least ten billion people, all with a very high
quality of life, there must be some much larger imaginable population
whose existence, if other things are equal, would be better, even
though its members have lives that are barely worth living&rdquo;
(Parfit 1987, p. 388). Call the outcome with the former (happier)
population \(x\) and the latter (more populous) outcome \(y\). Total
utilitarianism implies the Repugnant Conclusion because: if there are
enough individuals with a positive but very low level of well-being in
\(y\), its total well-being will exceed that of \(x\). Prioritarianism
likewise implies the Repugnant Conclusion. In fact, it even implies
the Super-repugnant Conclusion, according to which \(y\) can be
better, even if it holds a smaller total of well-being than \(x\)
(Holtug 2010, p. 254). This is because the well-being units in \(y\)
mostly fall at lower levels of well-being than the units in \(x\) and
so they have more weight, given the prioritarian transformation
function.</p>

<p>
Both total utilitarianism and prioritarianism also imply the Negative
Repugnant Conclusion, according to which an outcome, \(x^*\), in which
people have lives that are barely worth not living is worse than an
outcome, \(y^*\), in which 10 billion people have extremely miserable
lives (very much worth not living), if the former outcome is
sufficiently populous. But whereas total utilitarianism has this
implication if \(x^*\) holds a higher total of negative well-being
than \(y^*\), prioritarianism implies that it takes more people in
\(x^*\) to make this outcome worse. This is because, in \(y^*\), the
units of well-being will in general fall at lower (more negative)
levels than in \(x^*\). Therefore, relative to total utilitarianism,
prioritarianism may seem less plausible regarding the Repugnant
Conclusion, but more plausible regarding the Negative Repugnant
Conclusion. (For a challenge to applying prioritarianism to both
positive and negative levels of well-being in variable populations,
see Brown 2007.)</p>

<p>
Another aspect of prioritarianism, which some find attractive, is that
it implies a weaker version of the Asymmetry. According to the
Asymmetry, adding people with negative well-being to an outcome
detracts from its value, whereas adding people with positive
well-being does not increase its value (Narveson 1967, pp.
69&ndash;71). An implication of this view, which many find compelling,
is that concerns about their well-being do not ground an obligation to
have children (Heyd 1992; Narveson 1967; Roberts 1998; Wolf 1997).
Nevertheless, some have argued that the Asymmetry is too strong. For
example, it seems to suggest that, everything else being equal, it
would be better if people ceased to have children, because on the
assumption that a few of these children will have lives with net
negative well-being, this negative well-being cannot be
counterbalanced by the (presumably) many more future children who will
have lives with net positive well-being (Sikora 1978, pp.
136&ndash;140). In a weaker version, which does not have this
counterintuitive implication, but does prioritize the non-existence of
miserable children over the existence of happy ones, the Asymmetry
claims that for a given level of well-being, \(w\), adding an
individual with level &ndash;\(w\) detracts more from the value of an
outcome than adding an individual with level \(w\) increases such
value (Holtug 2022, pp. 49&ndash;50).</p>

<p>
There are various ways in which population ethicists have tried to
avoid repugnant conclusions and other difficulties regarding variable
populations. See generally Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (2005) and
Greaves (2017a). This is not the place to assess these proposals (and
serious objections have been raised against all of them), but merely
to point out how many of them are also available to prioritarians
(2022). Modal proposals involve delimiting the class of individuals
whose well-being counts when ranking outcomes. Thus, it has been
suggested that this class includes only actual people, that is, people
who exist in the actual history of the world (see Feinberg 1980, p.
180; Steinbock 1992, p. 72), or only necessary people, that is, people
who exist in all the outcomes compared (see Heyd 1992). Prioritarians
can delimit the scope of their principle in this manner if they so
desire.</p>

<p>
Another proposal involves tinkering with the functions on which
distributive principles rely. For example, just as total
utilitarianism could be replaced with average utilitarianism,
prioritarianism (as it has been defined above) could be replaced with
average prioritarianism (where the outcome ranking is based on the sum
of concavely transformed individual well-being, divided by the number
of individuals in the outcome). Average prioritarianism implies that,
as regards the Repugnant Conclusion, \(x\) is better than \(y\).
Similarly, there is a prioritarian version of critical level theory.
Critical level theories claim that there is a certain level of
well-being, \(l\), which is above zero, such that only lives above
\(l\) positively contribute to the value of an outcome (Blackorby,
Bossert, and Donaldson 1997). According to a prioritarian critical
level theory, the outcome ordering is based on the following function
(Adler 2009, p. 1510): \(m^\textit{prior-crit}(x) = [g(w_1 (x)) -
g(l)] + \ldots + [g(w_N (x)) - g(l)]\). Applied to the Repugnant
Conclusion, this principle implies that individuals with lives only
barely worth living do not contribute positively to the value of an
outcome, and so irrespective of the number of individuals in \(y\), it
cannot be better than \(x\).</p>
