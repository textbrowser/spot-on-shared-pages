<h1>Diagrams and Diagrammatical Reasoning</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Aug 28, 2001; substantive revision Mon Sep 15, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Diagrams (or pictures) probably rank among the oldest forms of human
communication. They have been used not only for representation but
also for carrying out certain types of reasoning. Reasoning as
performed by human beings typically involves information obtained
through more than one medium. Relatively recently, some philosophers,
psychologists, logicians, mathematicians, and computer scientists have
become increasingly aware of the importance of multi-modal reasoning
and, moreover, much research has been undertaken on the topic of
non-symbolic, especially diagrammatic,
 representation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 This entry outlines the overall directions of this research area, by
examining (i) diagrammatic reasoning adopted in various scientific
disciplines and (ii) diagrammatic representation systems in a formal
context of logic and mathematics. Some discussions of unique
properties of diagrammatic representation follow.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The identification of reasoning with sequences of sentences is a 20th
century development. In the centuries preceding the 20th,
non-sentential diagrammatic representations were taken to be an
acceptable means of inference in logic, mathematics and science. The
square of opposition for syllogistic reasoning, the diagrams of
Euclidean geometry and electric circuits are only a few cited
examples. In these cases, diagrams were used to carry out reasoning
without any qualification that they were reducible to sentences. At
the same time, the phrase &ldquo;carrying out reasoning&rdquo; is
somewhat ambiguous.</p>

<p>
Therefore, we recognize two distinct, albeit related, ways to carry
out reasoning with diagrams. One is to adopt diagrams as a reasoning
aid and the other is to take diagrams as an independent and systematic
language. We believe these two directions of research on
diagrams&mdash;diagrams as a reasoning tool versus diagrams as a
formal system&mdash;are not only are complementary to each other but
also assist each other and open up a related and new territory of
research on representation.</p>

<p>
The history of syllogism (or term logic) and its diagrammatic
representations illustrates how diagrammatic reasoning and
diagrammatic systems are closely related to each other. As is well
known,
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/" target="other"> the square of opposition </a>
 is a time-honored diagrammatic representation of the relations among
basic categorical statements. The square itself is not part of a
formal diagrammatic system, but diagrammatizes logical relations among
basic categorical statements. In the 14th century Buridan expressed
logical relations among more fine grained categorical propositions
with octagons of opposition.(Read) Syllogistic reasoning itself has
been explored for several hundred years through systematic
diagrammatic representation. In the 18th century Euler started the
train with circles to represent terms, a century later Venn expanded
the power of expression, and Peirce&rsquo;s further extension of term
logic diagrams follows in the 20th century. Syllogistic reasoning has
not been diagrammatized only by Euler&rsquo;s or Venn&rsquo;s circles.
Lambert&rsquo;s linear diagrams, Marquand&rsquo;s square diagrams, and
Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s somewhat different style of square diagrams are
well-known examples. (Chapter 2 of Gardner, and Moktefi and Shin)</p>

<p>
As various forms of inquiry into syllogisms show, we sometimes utilize
diagrams to explore logical reasoning, while sometimes we adopt
diagrams as a language to carry out reasoning itself. Acknowledging
that these two trends have their own long and extremely rich history,
the entry does not aim for a historical investigation but to discuss
more recent developments of research on each aspect of diagram use.
More specifically, we have the following goals for the entry. The
second section takes us to a rather broad topic&mdash;various kinds of
diagrammatic reasoning practiced in different disciplines. It is
challenging to address such a vastly diverse area under one section
and we have a plan to add more subsections in the near future. In the
third section, we would like to acquaint the reader with the details
of some specific diagrammatic systems. The case studies of the section
provide us not only with a concrete idea about what it takes for
representation to be a system but also with solid material for
handling theoretical and general issues involving diagrammatic
representation. Stepping out of particular reasoning or specific
diagrammatic systems by diagrams, we discuss in the fourth section
diagrammatic properties more generally. Being open-ended, the topic
invites further fruitful and significant work.</p>

<p>
The diagrammatic reasoning research discussed in the second section
starts with our ongoing adoption of diagrams in a non-formal setting
and focuses on the maximal utility of diagrams for efficient
reasoning. Being free from rigid rules and theoretical justification,
such research opens up the opportunity to explore intriguing questions
about our discriminatory adoptions of representation forms: Why do we
draw diagrams in certain parts of reasoning? Why do we adopt certain
types of diagrams here and different types of diagrams there? What
kinds of information are more easily represented in symbols or in
diagrams? Another important aspect of this practice-oriented research
helps us realize that there are many different kinds of
diagrams&mdash;so many and so various that we might need to justify
why all of these representations are called diagrams&mdash;while we do
not see any need to justify sentential representation.</p>

<p>
Sentential representation systems (e.g., first-order logic) have been
dominant in the modern history of logic, while diagrams have largely
been seen as only of marginal interest. Diagrams are usually adopted
as a heuristic tool in exploring a proof, but not as part of a
 proof.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Being aware of the dominance of symbolic over diagrammatic
representation in a formal setting, some researchers have explored the
possibility of formalizing diagrammatic representation and have
presented formal systems. Are there intrinsic differences between
symbolic and diagrammatic systems in terms of their logical status?
Some logicians have offered case studies to prove that diagrammatic
systems can be sound and complete in the same sense as symbolic
systems. This type of result directly refuted a widely-held assumption
that diagrams are inherently misleading, and abolished theoretical
objections to diagrams being used in proofs (Shin
 <a href="#shin94">1994</a>;
 Hammer
 <a href="#ham95a">1995a</a>).
 We would like to emphasize that the diagrammatic systems in the third
section are only examples and there are many other diagrammatic
systems. Interestingly, diagrammatic representation was not foreign to
Frege and Peirce---the two founders of predicate logic---as
Frege&rsquo;s notation in <em>Begriffsschrift</em> and Peirce&rsquo;s
Existential Graphs attest.</p>

<p>
The third section also presents a detailed case study of Euclidean
geometry. As already mentioned, the diagrammatic reasoning of
Euclidean geometry was traditionally (i.e. before the 20th century)
well accepted. Confirming the validity of this reasoning, the third
section formalizes Euclidean geometry so that diagrams become an
independent language. This case study shows how productive it is to
embrace two ways of using diagrams&mdash;diagrams as a reasoning tool
and diagrams as a formal system&mdash;in one project.</p>

<p>
Formalizing diagrams is not only a theoretical but also a meaningful
enterprise in the context of the modern tradition of sentential
formalization. The success of this task shows that logical concepts,
validity, consequence, consistent, etc. are not tied to a mode of
representation, but are understood in terms of information that is
conveyed in a given form of representation. Hence, there should be no
surprise or mystery with our diagrammatic reasoning practice.
Reasoning carried out by diagrams in various disciplines is as
legitimate as any verbal reasoning we have taken for granted.</p>

<p>
The fascinating issues raised about the practice of diagrammatic
reasoning in the second section, in turn, enrich diagram formalization
research in the following way: If certain kinds of information are
more apt to be represented and to be transformed by certain types of
representation, we may mix different modes of representation in one
system, that is, formalize multi-modal representation. There is no
theoretical reason why we need to stick to homogeneous representation
systems only. The syntax and the semantics of a formal system are
shown to be defined in a non-symbolic system and so are other logical
concepts, which formalization of diagrams illustrates. Furthermore,
there are convincing practical reasons why we would like to explore
heterogeneous systems, as diagrammatic reasoning research gets under
way. At the same time, the items discussed in the fourth section, that
is, properties unique to diagrams, if any, could also contribute to
the development of multi-reasoning research.</p>

<p>
For further discussion, we need to clarify two related but distinct
uses of the word &lsquo;diagram&rsquo;: diagram as internal mental
representation and diagram as external representation. The following
quotation from Chandrasekaran et al.
 (<a href="#dr95">1995</a>:
 p. xvii) succinctly sums up the distinction between internal versus
external diagrammatic representations:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>External diagrammatic representations</em>: These are
constructed by the agent in a medium in the external world (paper,
etc), but are meant as representations by the agent.</li>

<li><em>Internal diagrams or images</em>: These comprise the
(controversial) internal representations that are posited to have some
pictorial properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we will see below, logicians focus on external diagrammatic
systems, the imagery debate among philosophers of mind and cognitive
scientists is mainly about internal diagrams, and research on the
cognitive role of diagrams touches on both forms.</p>

<h2 id="DiaRea">2. Diagrammatic Reasoning</h2>

<p>
This section looks at the ways diagrams serve as a vehicle for thought
and reasoning. In section 2.1, we discuss the use of diagrams in
problem solving. In section 2.2, we look into the way diagrams are
adopted in mathematics as a reasoning tool to carry out mathematical
reasoning. In the last subsection, we explore the adoption of diagrams
in various scientific disciplines. As said in the Introduction, we are
perfectly aware that these subsections are far from being exhaustive
and anticipate additional subsections to appear</p>

<h3 id="DiaProSol">2.1 Diagrams in Problem-Solving</h3>

<p>
A common response on being confronted with the verbal presentation of
a problem in mathematics, the sciences or engineering is to diagram
it. What explains this? How does a diagram improve a problem
solver&rsquo;s position with respect to a problem?</p>

<p>
We can frame this question by looking to the mathematician George
Polya&rsquo;s beloved book <em>How to solve it?</em> (1945) about
heuristic methods in solving mathematical problems. Polya proposes
that the problem solving process be understood in terms of four steps:
(i) understanding the problem (pp. 6&ndash;8), (ii) devising a plan
(pp. 8&ndash;12), (iii) carrying out the plan (pp. 12&ndash;14), and
(iv) reviewing the solution (pp. 14&ndash;19). These steps are in
order: (i) should precede (ii), (iii) follows (ii), and the step (iv)
assumes all of the previous steps completed. Polya makes it clear the
importance of this order: &ldquo;It is foolish to answer a question
that you do not understand.&rdquo;(p. 6) Below we show representation
plays a crucial role at every step of the problem-solving process and
discuss how diagrammatic representation is handled in the relevant
literature.</p>

<p>
Poyla&rsquo;s first step of understanding a problem is directly
related to representing it, in two slightly different ways. First, a
problem is itself given to us in a certain representational format,
linguistically, visually, or in a mixed way. Hence, an initial
understanding of the problem is only possible within the framework of
a representational system. Second, in order to understand the problem
better a problem solver often changes the initial representation
format into another representation format. That is, even when a
problem is proposed in a linguistic text, we can re-represent it
visually, or (theoretically) vice versa. Acknowledging an individual
difference in preference between linguistic and visual representation,
many accept that representation greatly matters in understanding a
given problem. Polya&rsquo;s following statement directly addresses
our topic: &ldquo;Figures are not only the object of geometric
problems but also an important help for all sorts of problems in which
there is nothing geometric at the outset. Thus, &hellip; good reasons
to consider the role of figures in solving problems&rdquo; (p.
103).</p>

<p>
Interestingly, questions regarding representation do not recede after
the first step of Poyla&rsquo;s problem-solving process but continue
to matter in the second and third steps&mdash;i.e. making and
executing a plan. Even after a solver understands the problem, that
is, what is given and what is asked to do, we are far from bridging a
gap between where we are (i.e. premises) and where we should arrive at
(i.e. conclusion). We would like to build a bridge and build it
efficiently. Usually there is more than one way to get to the
conclusion from premises and among those many viable routes some
routes are better or more efficient than others. Thus both the
planning and execution steps are related to the efficiency issue.
Moreover, the routes along which these steps are taken depend directly
on how the problem is represented.</p>

<p>
It is necessary at this point to address an ambiguity surrounding the
use of the term &ldquo;representation.&rdquo; We can mean with it
either an internal or external representation, as mentioned briefly in
the Introduction. Cheng captures the distinction in the following way:
&ldquo;An ER [external representation] is a particular physically
rendered instance of a representation in the external environment; an
IR [internal representation] comprises the information associated with
the representation in the internal mental environment&rdquo;
 (<a href="#cheng16">2016</a>,
 p. 18) While these two different kinds of representation are closely
related to each other, how they interact with each other or the nature
of their relationship is far from being clear and has been one of the
main topics in cognitive science. Scaiffe and Rogers insightfully warn
us of &ldquo;the erroneous equivalence of external and internal
structure.&rdquo;(Scaiffe and Rogers,
 <a href="#scai96">1996</a>,
 p. 189) Acknowledging the existence of complicated stories involving
differences and relations between external and internal
representation, throughout the entry we mainly focus on external
representation. Accordingly, what we mean by diagrammatic or graphical
representation is a diagram or graph as an external representation,
not mental images as internal representation.</p>

<p>
When we talk about effective representation, then, we are talking
about effective external representation, rather than effective
internal representation. Interestingly and importantly, effective
external representation has two edges: effective (i) in the relation
to internal representation and (ii) in the relation to
problem-solving. If external diagrammatic representations are
effective in expressing internal representations, then is it effective
in solving a given problem? Some authors seem to give priority to (i):
&ldquo;We consider effective external representations in relation to
the internal representations they induce&rdquo; (Stockdill et al.,
 <a href="#stockdill">2021</a>,
 p. 39). Here we note that the relation between external and internal
representation has two different directions, one from internal to
external (when we express internal representation outwardly) and the
other from external to internal representation (when we understand
external representation internally): &ldquo;We would argue, however,
that the interplay between internal and external representations in
problem-solving is likely to be more complex, involving cyclical,
interacting processes, especially when considering how graphical
representations are both perceived and acted upon&rdquo; (Scaffie and
Rogers,
 <a href="#scai96">1996</a>,
 p. 203). At the same time, we realize that the reason why we are
interested in efficiency (i) is to solve a problem more efficiently,
that is, efficiency (ii). Hence, we mainly focus on the efficiency of
external representation in terms of the problem-solving process.
Scaffie and Roger carefully and nicely demarcate their research area
focusing on cognitive roles of external representations and coined the
phrase &ldquo;external cognition.&rsquo;&rsquo; (Scaiffe and Rogers,
 <a href="#scai96">1996</a>,
 p. 188)</p>

<p>
A seminal work on the nature of efficiency (ii) is Larkin and
Simon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why a Diagram is Sometimes Worth Ten Thousand
Words&rdquo;
 (<a href="#larksim">1987</a>).
 Central to their investigation is a distinction between the
informational and computational aspects of representations. Two
representations are informationally equivalent if they express the
same content. They are computationally equivalent if they express the
same content and allow for the same inferences to be &ldquo;easily and
quickly&rdquo; drawn from them. Larkin and Simon compare sentential
and diagrammatic representations of two example problems&mdash;one
from physics and one from geometry&mdash;and argue that while
equivalent informationally the two modes of representations differ
computationally. The two-dimensional presentation of diagrams
facilitates search in a way that a one-dimensional sentential
presentation does not. Moreover, there are key concepts and
relationships which are directly perceived in diagrammatic
representations but require some computational work to extract from
sentential representations. Larkin and Simon reiterate this point in a
discussion of the supply-demand graphs ubiquitous in economics texts,
which they consider to illustrate how effective diagrammatic
representation extends to abstract, nonspatial subject matters.
&ldquo;As in our other examples, the great utility of the diagram
arises from perceptual enhancement, the fact that it makes explicit
the relative positions of the equilibrium points, so that the
conclusion can be read off with the help of simple, direct perceptual
operations&rdquo; (Larkin and Simon,
 <a href="#larksim">1987</a>,
 p.95).</p>

<p>
The capacity of diagrammatic representations to enable a direct
`reading off&rsquo; of a conclusion is often understood in the
literature in terms of the notion of a free ride, introduced in
Barwise and Shimojiima
 (<a href="#barshim95">1995</a>)
 and more in Shimojima 1996. For Shimojima&rsquo;s most recent
formulation of a what free ride is, see Shimojima
 <a href="#shim15">2015</a>.
 In Stapleton et al.
 <a href="#stapleton">2017</a>,
 a notion of observational advantages is proposed as a generalization
of that of a free ride and is used to analyze the effectiveness of
Euler diagrams as a representation of set-theoretic relations.
 Stenning(<a href="#stenning02">2002</a>)
 offers an alternative theoretical approach: what distinguishes
diagrams as representations is the directness of the rules for
interpreting their syntax, and this enables an
&ldquo;agglomerative&rdquo; mode of reasoning.</p>

<p>
More recent work has explored more fine-grained criteria for effective
representation. After presenting five criteria (cf. 19 criteria by
Cheng
 <a href="#cheng16">2016</a>)
 for representation to be effective in relation to the internal
representation (i.e. direct encoding, low-cost inference, conceptual
transparency, generality, and conceptual-syntactic compatibility),
Stockdill et al.
 (<a href="#stockdill">2021</a>)
 discuss related, but not necessarily identical, aspects of
diagrammatic representation.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that among the various approaches to diagrammatic
reasoning and representation some scholars have expressed a healthy
skepticism towards a clear-cut category of diagrams, correctly
pointing out how difficult it is, if not impossible, to come up with
the necessary and sufficient conditions for some notation to qualify
as diagrammatic. Instead we can focus on practical aspects of diagram
use depending on which aspects of diagrams are emphasized.
Giardino&rsquo;s classification of diagrams in terms of (i)
dynamic/static and (ii) degree of structural similarity to what a
diagram represents is a good example for that direction of the
research. (&ldquo;Towards a diagrammatic classification,&rdquo;
 <a href="#giardino">2013</a>)</p>
 
<p>
Is our problem-solving discussion limited to human problem solving?
Not necessarily. More than a half century ago, &ldquo;Elements of a
theory of human problem solving&rdquo; (Newell, Shaw, and Simon,
 <a href="#newell">1958</a>,)
 reported their work on tentative relation between computer and human
problem-solving processes. Their classic paper &ldquo;Human Problem
Solving: The State of the Theory in 1970&rdquo; (Simon and Newell,
 <a href="#simon">1971</a>)
 further breaks down human problem-solving activities, having a
simulation program in mind. More recently, a group of researchers in
various areas have sharpened Simon and Newell&rsquo;s main ideas and
zoomed in on certain features of diagrammatic and heterogeneous
representation both in human problem solving and automated provers.
&ldquo;Considerations in Representations Selection for Problem
Solving: A Review&rdquo; (Stockdill, Raggi, Jamnik, Garcia and Cheng,
 <a href="#stockdill">2021</a>)
 is a good reference to introduce this topic as well.</p>

<h3 id="DiaMat">2.2 Diagrams in Mathematics</h3>

<p>
Commenting on Barwise and Etchemendy
 <a href="#baret91">1991</a>
 and Shin
 <a href="#shin94">1994</a>,
 Paolo Mancosu in
 <a href="#mancosu">2005</a>
 articulates a view skeptical of the philosophical value of work that
investigates diagrams in relation to issues of proof and
justification. Such work, on his view, remains within the confines of
a traditional philosophical approach. The capacity of diagrams to
further other epistemic goals in mathematics&mdash;e.g. discovery,
explanation, the genesis of concepts&mdash;is where the most fertile
philosophical ground lies.</p>

<p>
Exploring this philosophical ground is indeed fruitful; for a careful
and illuminating discussion that does this, see the entry
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-visual-thinking/" target="other"> The Epistemology of Visual Thinking in Mathematics</a>.
 Nevertheless, understanding diagrams is not a philosophical dead end.
In this section we survey the philosophical work that approaches
diagrams in mathematics from this perspective, where what is examined
are not individual diagrams in relation to individual mathematical
propositions or proofs but rather diagrammatic proof methods in
relation to mathematical subjects. The most prominent case of a
diagrammatic proof method is that of elementary Euclidean geometry.
Though it has received the most attention, recent work has also shed
light on the systematic use of diagrams in the contemporary
mathematical subjects of knot theory and category theory.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Diagrammatic proof methods: general philosophical issues</h4>

<p>
The assumption that diagrammatic proof methods exist is not a trivial
one given the default conception of rigorous mathematical proof as
sentential. Formulating it as a general philosophical position
requires addressing some questions on the nature of mathematical proof
and its relation to logic. Specifically: what conditions must a
diagrammatic proof method satisfy to qualify as a legitimate proof
method for a subject? And how do the proofs of a such a method relate
to those corresponding to them within a sentential axiomatization of
the subject?</p>

<p>
The discussion of diagrammatic proof methods in Larvor
 <a href="#larv19">2019</a>
 starts by considering a more general version of the second question:
how do the proofs of mathematical practice relate to their
formalizations in a sentential axiomatization? Citing arguments (e.g.
Detlefsen
 <a href="#detlefsen">2008</a>,
 Tanswell
 <a href="#tanswell">2015</a>
 ) that they do not capture the reasoning of the proofs, Larvor
proposes to broaden the notion of a proof&rsquo;s logical structure
&ldquo;to include mathematical inferences of any sort, including those
that cannot be modelled in [standard sentential] formal logic without
serious distortion.&rdquo; He takes Manders&rsquo; seminal work
&ldquo;The Euclidean diagram&rdquo;
 <a href="#manders">2008</a>
 to have revealed the logical structure of Euclid&rsquo;s plane proofs
in this broader sense. On the basis of Manders&rsquo; analysis he
formulates three conditions necessary for a diagrammatic proof
practice to be rigorous: a) it is easy to draw a diagram that shares
or otherwise indicates the structure of the mathematical object; b)
the information thus displayed is not metrical; and c) it is possible
to put the inferences into systematic mathematical relation with other
mathematical inferential practices.</p>

<p>
De Toffoli conceptualizes the diagrams of a diagrammatic proof method
as a kind of notation in
 <a href="#deT2022">2022</a>.
 She terms them <em>mathematical diagrams</em> and advances the
following as a &lsquo;Carnapian explication&rsquo; of the notion:</p>

<blockquote>
A <strong>mathematical diagram</strong> is a systematic notational
item used in mathematics that is either geometric-topological or two
dimensional, or both.
</blockquote>

<p>
The diagrams of Euclid, knot theory and category theory all fall under
this disjunctive definition. Though the diagrams of category theory do
not depict spatial objects or relations studied in geometry or
topology, they still count as mathematical diagrams because they are
two dimensional. And though a diagram of a geometric line is
one-dimensional, it still counts as a mathematical diagram because it
depicts a spatial object of geometry. The adjective
&lsquo;systematic&rsquo; is what in the definition secures the status
of mathematical diagrams as proof symbols. De Toffoli characterizes
the systematicity of a notation in terms of its <em>constitutive
features</em>&mdash;i.e. the features that carry mathematical meaning.
As a systematic notational item, a mathematical diagram has
constitutive features that 1) are clearly identifiable 2) are
reproducible and 3) allow for mathematically fruitful
manipulation.</p>

<p>
In contrast to Lavor, De Toffoli takes the possibility of a
propositional analyses of a diagrammatic method to be essential to its
status as a method. She fleshes out what conditions 1) and 3) amount
to in terms of such analyses. In identifying what a mathematical
diagram expresses via its constitutive features, we are according to
her grasping a content expressible as finite list of propositions; and
in manipulating a mathematical diagram, we are performing a
mathematical operation specifiable by a finite list of propositions.
There is thus in De Toffoli&rsquo;s account an important connection
between the proofs of a diagrammatic method and the proofs
corresponding to them in a sentential axiomatization. The existence of
the latter underlies our identification of the former as proofs. De
Toffoli stresses that this does not mean that there are no significant
epistemological advantages of the former over the latter. The
differences between them however are not for her to be understood as
<em>logical</em> differences as they are for Larvor. In his
alternative picture, diagrammatic methods are freestanding. They have
their own topic specific non-propositional logics, and are integrated
with the topic specific logics of other mathematical practices.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Accounts of specific diagrammatic proof methods</h4>

<p>
Assuming diagrammatic proof methods to exist thus may or may not
involve holding that diagrammatic logics exist. At the very least,
however, the assumption entails that there is an epistemological
significance to the various specific ways diagrams are used in
different mathematical subjects. Examining a specific diagrammatic
proof method and explaining how it works serves from this perspective
to deepen our understanding of the epistemology of mathematical
practice.</p>

<p>
Manders
 <a href="#manders">2008</a>
 set the paradigm for this kind of project. With respect to
Euclid&rsquo;s geometry specifically, it brought about a sea change in
how its diagrammatic method was understood within the philosophy of
mathematics. Instead of being dismissed out of hand as mathematically
illegitimate, it came to be a topic worthy of philosophical analysis.
Manders himself presents his analysis as part of a philosophical
project in which the mathematical norms governing artifacts such as
diagrams are studied to gain insights into the nature of mathematical
thought. In the account of Euclid&rsquo;s geometry advanced in Panza
 <a href="#Panza">2012</a>,
 diagrams have an essential role in constituting the segments, points
and circles the theory is about; they determine the identity
conditions of these geometrical objects as well as embody certain
properties and relations of them. Macbeth
 <a href="#Macbeth">2010</a>
 uses Euclid&rsquo;s proofs to develop a notion of diagrammatic
reasoning whereby diagrams serve to extend knowledge (rather than
merely make explicit what is already implicitly known). They do this,
according to Macbeth, by depicting objects not mentioned in the
construction of a proof&mdash;e.g. the two triangles that
&lsquo;pop-up&rsquo; in a diagram of a rectangle once a diagonal is
drawn between the rectangle&rsquo;s vertices. Building on Lassalle
Casanave
 <a href="#LassCas">2013</a>,
 Dal Magro and Valente
 <a href="#dalmagrovalente">2021</a>
 conceptualizes the diagrams of elementary Euclidean geometry as
co-exact <em>samples</em> (in the sense of Goodman
 <a href="#goodman">2021</a>)
 and argues for the advantages of such a conceptualization in
accounting for Euclid&rsquo;s diagrammatic reductio ad absurdum
proofs. Waszek
 <a href="#Waszek22">2022</a>
 also discusses these proofs in assessing whether they show&mdash;as
Manders
 <a href="#manders">2008</a>
 asserts&mdash;that Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams do not represent geometric
objects. Finally, for a detailed historical argument that the fourth
and fifth common notions of the <em>Elements</em> were introduced in
late antiquity to regulate diagrammatic inferences, see De Risi
 <a href="#derisi">2020</a>.</p>
 
<p>
A field of contemporary mathematics where diagrams are ubiquitous is
knot theory. The knots studied in knot theory are curves that define a
closed path in space and do not self-intersect. Projections of these
curves onto the plane (with information indicating the relative
heights of the projected portions of the knot at points of
intersection) are termed <em>knot diagrams</em> and are canonically
presented with graphical diagrams. Much of knot theory concerns how
knots can be classified according to properties of their knot
diagrams. Since it is via graphic diagrams that these properties are
determined for simple examples of knot diagrams, the diagrammatic
method of knot theory is in a strong sense fundamental to it. De
Toffoli and Giardino
 <a href="#deTG2014">2014</a>
 gives an account of both what makes this method a method and the
cognitive processes underlying its implementation in practice.</p>

<p>
Category theory furnishes a second example of a contemporary
mathematical subject in which a diagrammatic method is employed. As
mentioned above, its diagrams do not concern mathematical objects that
are in any sense spatial. They instead depict relationships and
substructures present within the abstract algebraic structure of a
category. As with any algebraic structure, the atomic sentences of
category theory are equations. All the information expressed by
diagrams in its diagrammatic proofs could thus also be expressed by
logically complex sentences built up from equations. Why isn&rsquo;t
this done? What is the epistemic value of opting for diagrams over
sentences? De Toffoli
 <a href="#deT2017">2017</a>
 explores this question with a case study of two proofs of homological
algebra in which the diagrams of category theory are used.</p>

<h3 id="DiaSciRea">2.3 Diagrams in Scientific Reasoning</h3>

<p>
From science textbooks to scientific magazines and scholarly journal
articles, we encounter numerous photos, drawings, diagrams, tables,
and charts. The roles of these non-sentential forms are too diverse to
be covered here. Focusing on three scientific areas&mdash;biology,
chemistry, and physics, we introduce some of intriguing and novel
research on diagrammatic representation in scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>
There is something special about biology in terms of visual
information and visual representation: Unlike mathematics, one might
think biology inherently handles spatial information. Living things
take up space, and physicochemical processes of organisms take place
in physical space. Hence, we may easily convince ourselves that
diagrammatic representation should be more natural in biology than
other disciplines. Analogy to the use of diagrams in geometry: We are
proving something about figures, say, a triangle. Objects of geometry
are inherently (at least) two-dimensional. Hence, drawing a triangle
is much more natural than introducing a sentential symbol as a
triangle. In spite of a somewhat analogous aspect, there is a
fundamental difference between biology and geometry in the role of
diagrams. A triangle-token drawn on the board represents triangle in
general or triangle-type and we agree triangle in general is abstract.
However, organisms, for example, cells, are not abstract entities and
what happens to organisms is concrete physicochemical process we could
record and we could take a picture of. This is a clear difference in
the nature of represented information between in geometry and in
biology. There is no scene geometricians can take a picture of, since
concrete triangles are not an object of investigation. On the other
hand, biology aims to explain physicochemical processes of concrete
living creatures. Hence, we could show actual cells and their changing
processes by photo-slides. In some sense, these slides are visual
representation while we could describe what is happening in a
non-visual mode, that is, by sentences. On the other hand, not many of
us would argue these photo-slides are diagrammatic representation of
biological information. Rather we would say: What slides show can be
represented either by words or by diagrams. As we know, diagrams are
adopted more than frequently by biologists. Philosophers and
scientists have discussed in depth how diagrams have helped us to
carry out biological reasoning. What kinds of special, if any, nature
of diagrammatic representation contribute to biological research? Some
might be unique in the case of biological research and some common
among scientific inferences.</p>

<p>
Being able to take a picture of certain biological processes might
assign a special status to diagrams over sentential representation,
one might say. However, there are several reasons why this would not
get us off from the ground. First, biological reasoning involves
inference, not just observation, and pictures of changing scenes do
not explain to us why that change takes place. Second, even though
non-diagrammatic photo images and diagrammatic representations share
spatial features, there is a fundamental difference between these two
kinds of representation. When we draw a diagram, we intentionally skip
certain aspects of biological scenes in order to carry out the
relevant biological reasoning. On the other hand, photo images are not
produced through intentional selectivity. The selectivity aspect makes
diagrammatic images richer than photo images in terms of reasoning.
Hence, third, there are various kinds of diagrammatic representations
depending on which features are brought in along with spatial
features. Perini
 (<a href="#perini">2013</a>)
 presents three types of diagrams depending on how different features
are adopted for selective representation: pictorial diagrams,
compositional diagrams, and schematic drawings. Quasi-visual matching
plays a role in the case of pictorial diagrams, hence, closer to
non-diagrammatic photo image, with less, but more focused information
than photo-images. Not relying on visual matching between diagrammatic
components and their referents, say atoms, compositional diagrams take
structures of components to be the most important representing fact.
These diagrams are used in reasoning changing spatial relations among
atomic components. Schematic diagrams do not portray details but
overall contours, hence, representing generic features. Unlike
electron micrographic images filled with details, schematic drawings
help us reason through represented fact more easily by focusing on
relevant information. Perini&rsquo;s classification among diagrams,
emphasizing common and different aspects of each kind of diagram,
opens up further fruitful diagrammatic research. There might be more
different kinds of diagrams in biology. Even more importantly, other
scientific areas might have different ways to classify various
diagrams in their own disciplines.</p>

<p>
Instead of classifying kinds of diagrams, Jones and Wolkenhauer
 (<a href="#jones">2012</a>)
 delve into the special nature of spatial features of diagrams in
biological reasoning, and analyzes several roles of diagrams in more
depth, including the construction of mathematical models and both
functional and nomological explanations of the cell cycle. And they
propose locality aids as the main feature of diagrams to carry out
these crucial roles. Diagrams, being two-dimensional, group relevant
pieces of information in a unique and efficient way, especially
compared with sentential representation. When visually grouped
together or topological structures represented, diagrammatic
representation helps users to narrow down research space. As a result,
extracting information, and furthermore, formulating and testing
hypotheses become easier through diagrams. Sharpening the existing
views of features and advantages of diagrammatic
representations&mdash;two-dimensional (hence, spatial) features and
explicitness&mdash;they locate the source of these strengths more
specifically, that is, grouping information, in the case of biological
reasoning.</p>

<p>
We cannot imagine a physics class without diagrams drawn on the board,
from almost universally adopted diagrams, e.g. vector diagrams,
free-body diagrams, force diagrams, circuit diagrams, ray diagrams,
etc., to more specific, nonetheless well-known, diagrams, say Feynman
diagram or endless versions of quantum physics diagrams. One of the
most recent and the most revolutionary enterprise for diagrammatic
reasoning in physics has taken place in quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>
Facing mysteries of quantum mechanics, Bob Coecke
 (<a href="#coecke10">2010</a>)
 has been working on &ldquo;better formalism for quantum
theory.&rdquo; He aims to look for a &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; more
structure-oriented representation, while existing quantum mechanical
formalism is much too detailed low-level. He develops a diagrammatic
representation for quantum physics and calls it &ldquo;quantum
picturalism.&rdquo; Diagrams are much better equipped with
representing structures, hence, high-level representation, according
to Coecke. One can easily see the scope of Coecke and
Kissinger&rsquo;s ambitious project by opening an impressive book
<em>Picturing Quantum Processes</em>.
 (<a href="#coecke17">2017</a>)</p>
 
<p>
Visual language has always been with chemistry, as Knight shows
 (<a href="#knight">1996</a>),
 including drawings of labs, illustrations of experiment process, etc.
Interestingly, as chemistry has become more scientific, &ldquo;[a]
richer pictorial language had given way to something more like
geometry&rdquo; (Knight,
 <a href="#knight">1996</a>,
 p. 147). As mentioned in the case of biology, photo-images are not
adopted to carry out scientific reasoning. &ldquo;The photograph
displays a particular piece of apparatus in a particular setting; and
for most scientific purposes something more diagrammatic is more
useful&rdquo; (Knight,
 <a href="#knight">1996</a>,
 p. 151). To many of us, learning chemistry is often associated with
understanding diagrams of atomic structures and chemical bonds.
Representing three dimensional entities of molecules to
two-dimensional flat diagrams is not a distortion of reality, but an
accurate and efficient way of representing certain structures among
elements which chemists aim to show and explain. The periodic table of
elements is a prime example of diagrammatic representation which is
distinctly different from sentential descriptions and any image a
photograph could produce. Grouping and classifying chemical elements
in terms of a visually clear table &ldquo;transformed the
science&rdquo; (Knight,
 <a href="#knight">1996</a>,
 p. 161). Extracting properties of elements from this organized Table
can be achieved through the abstract nature of a table we are familiar
with, that is, columns and rows. This is one of the most powerful ways
to adopt diagrammatic representation to present relevant information
and work on it.</p>

<h2 id="DiaForSys">3. Diagrammatic Formal Systems</h2>

<p>
Our cases studies of diagrammatic formal systems fall into two broad
categories: systems which formalize diagrammatic representation in
logic and systems which formalize diagrammatic representation in
elementary geometry. The former are discussed in 3.1, the latter in
3.2.</p>

<h3 id="EulVenPeiBey">3.1 Euler, Venn, Peirce, and Beyond</h3>

<p>
The dominance of sentential representation systems in the history of
modern logic has obscured several important facts about diagrammatic
systems. One of them is that several well-known diagrammatic systems
were available as a heuristic tool before the era of modern logic.
Euler circles, Venn diagrams, and Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s squares have
been widely used for certain types of syllogistic reasoning (Euler
 <a href="#euler">1768</a>;
 Venn
 <a href="#venn">1881</a>;
 Carroll
 <a href="#carroll">1896</a>).
 Another interesting, but neglected, story is that a founder of modern
symbolic logic, Charles Peirce, not only revised Venn diagrams but
also invented a graphical system, Existential Graphs, which has been
proven to be equivalent to a predicate language (Peirce
 <a href="#peirce">1933</a>;
 Roberts
 <a href="#roberts">1973</a>;
 Zeman
 <a href="#zeman">1964</a>).</p>
 
<p>
These existing diagrams have inspired research in multi-modal
representation. Logicians who participate in the project have explored
the subject in two distinct ways. First, their interest has focused
exclusively on externally-drawn representation systems, as opposed to
internal mental representations. Second, their aim has been to
establish the logical status of a system, rather than to explain its
heuristic power, by testing the correctness and the expressive power
of selective representation systems. If a system fails to justify its
soundness or if its expressive power is too limited, a
logician&rsquo;s interest in that language will fade (Sowa
 <a href="#sow84">1984</a>;
 Shin
 <a href="#shin94">1994</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In this section, we examine the historical development of Euler and
Venn diagrams as a case study to illustrate the following aspects:
First, this process will show us how one mathematician&rsquo;s simple
intuition about diagramming syllogistic reasoning has gradually been
developed into a formal representation system. Second, we will observe
different emphases given to different stages of extension and
modification of a diagrammatic system. Thirdly and relatedly, this
historical development illustrates an interesting tension and
trade-off between the expressive power and visual clarity of
diagrammatic systems. Most importantly, the reader will witness
logicians tackle the issue of whether there is any intrinsic reason
that sentential systems, but not diagrammatic systems, could provide
us with rigorous proofs, and their success in answering this question
in the negative.</p>

<p>
Hence, the reader will not be surprised by the following conclusion
drawn by Barwise and Etchemendy, the first logicians to launch an
inquiry into diagrammatic proofs in logic,</p>

<blockquote>
there is no principled distinction between inference formalisms that
use text and those that use diagrams. One can have rigorous, logically
sound (and complete) formal systems based on diagrams. (Barwise &amp;
Etchemendy
 <a href="#be95">1995</a>:
 214)
</blockquote>

<p>
This conviction was necessary for the birth of their innovative
computer program <em>Hyperproof</em>, which adopts both first-order
languages and diagrams (in a <em>multi-modal</em> system) to teach
elementary logic courses (Barwise &amp; Etchemendy
 <a href="#be94">1993</a>
 and Barwise &amp; Etchemendy
 <a href="#be94">1994</a>).</p>
 
<h4>3.1.1 Euler diagrams</h4>

<p>
Leonhard Euler, an 18th century mathematician, adopted closed curves
to illustrate syllogistic reasoning (Euler
 <a href="#euler">1768</a>).
 The four kinds of categorical sentences are represented by him as
shown in Figure 1.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Four cases: the first labeled &lsquo;All A are B&rsquo; has an inner circle labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; completely inside an outer circle labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;; the second labeled &lsquo;No A is B&rsquo; has two non-overlapping circles, one labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the other &lsquo;B&rsquo;; the third labeled &lsquo;Some A is B&rsquo; has two overlapping circles, the overlap is labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the non-overlap bit of one circle is labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;; the fourth case labeled &lsquo;Some A is not B&rsquo; has two overlapping circles, the non-overlap bit of one is labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the non-overlap bit of the other is labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;" src="fig-1.png" style="width:550px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1:</span> Euler Diagrams</p>
</div>

<p>
For the two universal statements, the system adopts spatial relations
among circles in an intuitive way: If the circle labelled
&lsquo;\(A\)&rsquo; is <em>included</em> in the circle labelled
&lsquo;\(B\),&rsquo; then the diagram represents the information that
all \(A\) is \(B\). If there is <em>no overlapping</em> part between
two circles, then the diagram conveys the information that no \(A\) is
\(B\).</p>

<p>
This representation is governed by the following
 convention:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<blockquote>
Every object \(x\) in the domain is assigned a unique location, say
\(l(x)\), in the plane such that \(l(x)\) is \(in\) region \(R\) if
and only if \(x\) is a member of the set that the region \(R\)
represents.
</blockquote>

<p>
The power of this representation lies in the fact that an object being
a member of a set is easily conceptualized as the object falling
inside the set, just as locations on the page are thought of as
falling inside or outside drawn circles. The system&rsquo;s power also
lies in the fact that no additional conventions are needed to
establish the meanings of diagrams involving more than one circle:
relationships holding among sets are asserted by means of the same
relationships holding among the circles representing them. The
representations of the two universal statements, &lsquo;All \(A\)are
\(B\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;No \(A\) is \(B\),&rsquo; illustrate this
strength of the system.</p>

<p>
Moving on to two existential statements, this clarity is not
preserved. Euler justifies the diagram of &ldquo;Some \(A\) is
\(B\)&rdquo; saying that we can infer <em>visually</em> that something
in \(A\) is also contained in \(B\) since part of area \(A\) is
contained in area \(B\) (Euler 1768: 233). Obviously, Euler himself
believed that the same kind of visual containment relation among areas
can be used in this case as well as in the case of universal
statements. However, Euler&rsquo;s belief is not correct and this
representation raises a damaging ambiguity. In this diagram, not only
is part of circle \(A\) contained in area \(B\) (as Euler describes),
but the following are true: (i) part of circle \(B\) is contained in
area \(A\) (ii) part of circle \(A\) is not contained in circle \(B\)
(iii) part of circle \(B\) is not contained in circle \(A\). That is,
the third diagram could be read off as &ldquo;Some \(B\) is
\(A\),&rdquo; &ldquo;Some \(A\) is not \(B\),&rdquo; and &ldquo;Some
\(B\) is not \(A\)&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;Some \(A\) is
\(B\).&rdquo; In order to avoid this ambiguity, we need to set up
several more
 conventions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Euler&rsquo;s own examples nicely illustrate the strengths and
weaknesses of his diagrammatic system.</p>

<div class="indent">
<strong>Example 1</strong>. All \(A\) are \(B\). All \(C\) are \(A\).
Therefore, all \(C\) are \(B\).

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Three concentric circles, the innermost one labeled &lsquo;C&rsquo;, the next labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo;, and the outermost one labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;" src="ex-1.png" style="width:150px" />
</div>

<p>
<strong>Example 2</strong>. No \(A\) is \(B\). All \(C\) are \(B\).
Therefore, no \(C\) is \(A\).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="On the left a circle labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and on the right two concentric circles, the inner one labeled &lsquo;C&rsquo; and the outer one labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;" src="ex-2.png" style="width:200px" />
</div>
</div>

<p>
In both examples, the reader can easily infer the conclusion, and this
illustrates visually powerful features of Euler diagrams. However,
when existential statements are represented, things become more
complicated, as explained above. For instance:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Example 3</strong>. No \(A\) is \(B\). Some \(C\) is \(A\).
Therefore, Some \(C\) is not \(B\).</p>

<p>
No single diagram can represent the two premises, since the
relationship between sets \(B\) and \(C\) cannot be fully specified in
one single diagram. Instead, Euler suggests the following three
possible cases:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Three cases: Case 1 has on the left two overlapping circles, the overlap is labeled &lsquo;C&rsquo; and the non-overlap section of first circle is labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo;; on the right and separate is a third circle labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;. Case 2 has three circles, two of the circles overlap and the overlap section is labeled &lsquo;C&rsquo; and the non-overlap section of the first circle is labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo;; in the non-overlap section of the second circle is the third circle labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;. Case 3 is similar to Case 2 except the third circle is not completely within the non-overlap section of the second circle; the section of the third circle outside the second circle is labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;" src="ex-3.png" style="width:500px" />
</div>
</div>

<p>
Euler claims that the proposition &lsquo;Some \(C\) is not
\(B\)&rsquo; can be read off from all these diagrams. However, it is
far from being visually clear how the first two cases lead a user to
reading off this proposition, since a user might read off &ldquo;No
\(C\) is \(B\)&rdquo; from case 1 and &ldquo;All \(B\) is \(C\)&rdquo;
from case 2.</p>

<p>
Hence, the representation of existential statements not only obscures
the visual clarity of Euler Circles but also raises serious
interpretational problems for the system. Euler himself seemed to
recognize this potential problem and introduced a new syntactic
device, &lsquo;*&rsquo; (representing non-emptiness) as an attempt to
repair this flaw (1768: Letter 105).</p>

<p>
However, a more serious drawback is found when this system fails to
represent certain compatible (that is, consistent) pieces of
information in a single diagram. For example, Euler&rsquo;s system
prevents us from drawing a single diagram representing the following
pairs of statements: (i) &ldquo;All \(A\) are \(B\)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;No \(A\) is \(B\)&rdquo; (which are consistent if \(A\) is an
empty set). (ii) &ldquo;All \(A\) are \(B\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;All
\(B\) are \(A\)&rdquo; (which are consistent when \(A = B)\). (iii)
&ldquo;Some \(A\) is \(B\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;All \(A\) are
\(B\)&rdquo;. (Suppose we drew an Euler diagram for the former
proposition and try to add a new compatible piece of information,
i.e., the latter, to this existing diagram.) This shortcoming is
closely related to Venn&rsquo;s motivation for his own diagrammatic
system (see
 <a href="#LimDiaRepRea">Section 4.1</a>
 for other shortcomings of Euler&rsquo;s system).</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Venn diagrams</h4>

<p>
Venn&rsquo;s criticism of Euler Circles is summarized in the following
passage:</p>

<blockquote>
The weak point in this [Euler diagrams], and in all similar schemes,
consists in the fact that they only illustrate in strictness the
actual relation of classes to each other, rather than the imperfect
knowledge of these relations which we may possess, or may wish to
convey by means of the proposition. (Venn
 <a href="#venn">1881</a>:
 510)
</blockquote>

<p>
Because of its strictness, Euler&rsquo;s system sometimes fails in
representing consistent pieces of information in a single diagram, as
shown above. In addition to this expressive limitation, Euler&rsquo;s
system also suffers other kinds of expressive limitations with respect
to non-empty sets, due to topological restrictions on plane figures
(see
 <a href="#LimDiaRepRea">Section 4.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Venn&rsquo;s new system
 (<a href="#venn">1881</a>)
 was to overcome these expressive limitations so that partial
information can be represented. The solution was his idea of
&lsquo;primary diagrams&rsquo;. A primary diagram represents all the
possible set-theoretic relations between a number of sets, without
making any existential commitments about them. For example, Figure 2
shows the primary diagram about sets \(A\) and \(B\).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="two overlapping circles, the first labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the second labeled &lsquo;B&rsquo;" src="fig-2.png" style="width:150px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2:</span> Venn&rsquo;s Primary
diagrams</p>
</div>

<p>
According to Venn&rsquo;s system, this diagram does not convey any
specific information about the relation between these two sets. This
is the major difference between Euler and Venn diagrams.</p>

<p>
For the representation of universal statements, unlike the visually
clear spatial containment relations in the case of Euler diagrams,
Venn&rsquo;s solution is &lsquo;to shade them [the appropriate areas]
out&rsquo; (Venn
 <a href="#venn">1881</a>:
 122). By using this syntactic device, we obtain diagrams for
universal statements as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Two Venn diagrams. The first is titled &lsquo;All A are B&rsquo; and consists of two overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;, the section of A that does not overlap with B is shaded. The second is titled &lsquo;No A is B&rsquo; and also consists of two overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;, the overlap of the two circles is shaded." src="fig-3a.png" style="width:300px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3:</span> Venn&rsquo;s shading</p>
</div>

<p>
Venn&rsquo;s choice of shading might not be absolutely arbitrary in
that a shading could be interpreted as a visualization of set
emptiness. However, it should be noted that a shading is a new
syntactic device which Euler did not use. This revision gave
flexibility to the system so that certain compatible pieces of
information may be represented in a single diagram. In the following,
the diagram on the left combines two pieces of information, &ldquo;All
\(A\) are \(B\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;No \(A\) is \(B\),&rdquo; to
visually convey the information &ldquo;Nothing is \(A\).&rdquo; The
diagram on the right, which represents both &ldquo;All \(A\) are
\(B\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;All \(B\) are \(A\),&rdquo; clearly shows that
\(A\) is the same as \(B\):</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Two Venn diagrams: the first has two overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;; circle A is shaded. The second is also two overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;, both circles are shaded except where they overlap" src="fig-3b.png" style="width:300px" class="nocaption" />
</div>

<p>
In fact, using primary diagrams also avoids some other expressivity
problems (to do with spatial properties of diagram objects) discussed
below, in
 <a href="#DiaPro">Section 4</a>.
 Surprisingly, Venn was silent about the representation of existential
statements, which was another difficulty of Euler diagrams. We can
only imagine that Venn might have introduced another kind of a
syntactic object representing existential commitment. This is what
Charles Peirce did about twenty years later.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Peirce&rsquo;s extension</h4>

<p>
Peirce points out that Venn&rsquo;s system has no way of representing
the following kinds of information: existential statements,
disjunctive information, probabilities, and relations. Peirce aimed to
extend Venn&rsquo;s system in expressive power with respect to the
first two kinds of propositions, i.e., existential and disjunctive
statements. This extension was completed by means of the following
three devices. (i) Replace Venn&rsquo;s shading representing emptiness
with a new symbol, &lsquo;o&rsquo;. (ii) Introduce a symbol
&lsquo;x&rsquo; for existential import. (iii) For disjunctive
information, introduce a linear symbol &lsquo;-&rsquo; which connects
&lsquo;o&rsquo; and &lsquo;x&rsquo; symbols.</p>

<p>
For example, Figure 4 represents the statement, &lsquo;All \(A\) are
\(B\) or some \(A\) is \(B\)&rsquo;, which neither Euler&rsquo;s nor
Venn&rsquo;s system can represent in a single diagram.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Two overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;; inside the overlap is a label &lsquo;x&rsquo; and inside of the non-overlapping bit of circle A is a label &lsquo;o&rsquo;; a line connects &lsquo;x&rsquo; to &lsquo;o&rsquo;" src="fig-4a.png" style="width:200px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4:</span> A Peirce diagram</p>
</div>

<p>
The reason that Peirce replaced Venn&rsquo;s shading for emptiness
with the symbol &lsquo;o&rsquo; seems to be obvious: It would not be
easy to connect shadings or shadings and &lsquo;x&rsquo;s in order to
represent disjunctive information. In this way, Peirce increased the
expressive power of the system, but this change was not without its
costs.</p>

<p>
For example, the following diagram represents the proposition
&lsquo;<em>Either</em> all \(A\) are \(B\) and some \(A\) is \(B, or\)
no \(A\) is \(B\) and some \(B\) is not \(A\)&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="two overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;; first, inside the non-overlapping section of circle A is an &lsquo;o&rsquo; connected by a line to an &lsquo;o&rsquo; inside the overlap; second, also in the non-overlapping section of circle A is another &lsquo;o&rsquo; connected by a line to an &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the non-overlapping section of circle &lsquo;B&rsquo;; third in the overlapping section of the two circles are an &lsquo;x and an &lsquo;o&rsquo; connected by a line; fourth an &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the overlapping section connected by a line to an &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the non-overlapping section of circle B." src="fig-4b.png" style="width:200px" class="nocaption" />
</div>

<p>
Reading off this diagram requires more than reading off visual
containment among circles (as in Euler diagrams) or shadings (as in
Venn diagrams), but also requires extra conventions for reading
combinations of the symbols &lsquo;o,&rsquo; &lsquo;x,&rsquo; and
lines. Peirce&rsquo;s new conventions increased the expressive power
of single diagrams, but the arbitrariness of its conventions and more
confusing representations (for example, the above diagram) sacrificed
the visual clarity which Euler&rsquo;s original system enjoys. At this
point, Peirce himself confesses that &lsquo;there is a great
complexity in the expression that is essential to the meaning&rsquo;
(Peirce
 <a href="#peirce">1933</a>:
 4.365). Thus, when Peirce&rsquo;s revision was completed, most of
Euler&rsquo;s original ideas about visualization were lost, except
that a geometrical object (the circle) is used to represent (possibly
empty) sets.</p>

<p>
Another important contribution Peirce made to the study of diagrams
starts with the following remark:</p>

<blockquote>
&lsquo;Rule&rsquo; is here used in the sense in which we speak of the
&lsquo;rules&rsquo; of algebra; that is, as a permission under
strictly defined conditions. (Peirce
 <a href="#peirce">1933</a>:
 4.361)
</blockquote>

<p>
Peirce was probably the first person to discuss rules of
transformation in a non-sentential representation system. In the same
way that the rules of algebra tell us which transformations of symbols
are permitted and which are not, so should the rules of diagram
manipulation. Some of Pierce&rsquo;s six rules needed more
clarification and turn out to be incomplete&mdash;a problem which
Peirce himself anticipated. However, more importantly, Peirce did not
have any theoretical tool&mdash;a clear distinction between syntax and
semantics&mdash;to convince the reader that each rule is correct or to
determine whether more rules are needed. That is, his important
intuition (that there could be transformation rules for diagrams)
remained to be justified.</p>

<h4>3.1.4 Formalization</h4>

<p>
Shin
 (<a href="#shin94">1994</a>)
 follows up Peirce&rsquo;s work in two directions. One is to improve
Peirce&rsquo;s version of Venn diagrams, and the other is to prove the
soundness and the completeness of this revised system.</p>

<p>
Shin&rsquo;s work alters Peirce&rsquo;s modifications of Venn diagrams
to achieve an increase in expressive power without such a severe loss
of visual clarity. This revision is made in two stages: (i) Venn-I:
retains Venn&rsquo;s shadings (for emptiness), Peirce&rsquo;s
&lsquo;x&rsquo; (for existential import) and Peirce&rsquo;s connecting
line between &lsquo;x&rsquo;s (for disjunctive information). (ii)
Venn-II: This system, which is proven to be logically equivalent to
monadic predicate logic, is the same as Venn-I except that a
connecting line between diagrams is newly introduced to display
disjunctive information.</p>

<p>
Returning to one of Euler&rsquo;s examples we will see the contrast
among these different versions clearly:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Example 3</strong>. No \(A\) is \(B\). Some \(C\) is \(A\).
Therefore, Some \(C\) is not \(B\).</p>

<p>
Euler admits that no single Euler diagram can be drawn to represent
the premises, but that three possible cases must be drawn.
Venn&rsquo;s system is silent about existential statements. Now,
Peirce&rsquo;s and Shin&rsquo;s systems represent these two premises
in a single diagram as follows:</p> <!--resume here, copy image to local dir and change name. also determine whether this should be Example 4 -->

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Two diagrams both consisting of three overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo;, &lsquo;B&rsquo;, and &lsquo;C&rsquo;. The first diagram, titled &lsquo;Peirce&rsquo;, has in the overlap of all three circles an &lsquo;x&rsquo; connected to an &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the overlap of only circles A and C; it also has in the overlap of all three circles an &lsquo;o&rsquo; and also an &lsquo;o&rsquo; in the overlap of only circles A and B. The second diagram, titled &lsquo;Shin&rsquo;, has in the overlap of all three circles an &lsquo;x&rsquo; connected to an &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the overlap of only circles A and C; the overlap of A and B is shaded." src="ex-3b.png" style="width:400px" class="nocaption" />
</div>

<p>
In the case of Shin&rsquo;s diagram, Venn&rsquo;s shading convention
for emptiness, as opposed to Peirce&rsquo;s &lsquo;o&rsquo;, much more
naturally leads the reader to the inference &ldquo;Some \(C\) is not
\(B\)&rdquo; than in the case of Peirce&rsquo;s diagram.</p>

<p>
However, Venn-I cannot express disjunctive information between
universal statements or between universal and existential statements.
Retaining Venn-I&rsquo;s expressive power, Venn-II allows diagrams to
be connected by a line. Peirce&rsquo;s confusing looking diagram above
is equivalent to the following Venn-II diagram:</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:center">
<img alt="Two rectangles connected by a line each containing two overlapping circles; in the first rectangle, the overlap of the two circles contains an &lsquo;x&rsquo; and the non-overlap section of the first circle is shaded; in the second rectangle the overlap section of the two circles is shaded and an &lsquo;x&rsquo; is in the non-overlap section of the second circle" src="ex-3c.png" style="width:300px" />
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition to this revision, Shin
 (<a href="#shin94">1994</a>)
 presented each of these two systems as a standard formal
representation system equipped with its own syntax and semantics. The
syntax tells us which diagrams are acceptable, that is, which are
well-formed, and which manipulations are permissible in each system.
The semantics defines logical consequences among diagrams. Using these
tools, it is proven that the systems are sound and complete, in the
same sense that some symbolic logics are.</p>

<p>
This approach has posed a fundamental challenge to some of the
assumptions held about representation systems. Since the development
of modern logic, important concepts, e.g., syntax, semantics,
inference, logical consequence, validity, and completeness, have been
applied to sentential representation systems only. However, none of
these turned out to be intrinsic to these traditional symbolic logics
only. For <em>any</em> representation system, whether it is sentential
or diagrammatic, we can discuss two levels, a syntactic and a semantic
level. What inference rules tell us is how to manipulate a given unit,
whether symbolic or diagrammatic, to another. The definition of
logical consequence is also free from any specific form of a
representation system. The same argument goes for the soundness and
the completeness proofs. When a system is proven to be sound, we
should be able to adopt it in proofs. In fact, much current research
explores the use of diagrams in automated theorem proving (see
Barker-Plummer &amp; Bailin
 <a href="#dbp97">1997</a>;
 and Jamnik et al.
 <a href="#jam99">1999</a>).</p>
 
<h4>3.1.5 Euler&rsquo;s circle revisited</h4>

<p>
It is interesting and important to notice that the gradual changes
made from Euler Circles through to Shin&rsquo;s systems share one
common theme: to increase both the expressive and logical power of the
system so that it is sound, complete, and logically equivalent to
monadic predicate logic. The main revision from Euler to Venn
diagrams, introducing primary diagrams, allows us to represent partial
knowledge about relations between sets. The extension from Venn to
Peirce diagrams is made so that existential and disjunctive
information may be represented more effectively.</p>

<p>
Both Venn and Peirce adopted the same kind of solution in order to
achieve these improvements: to introduce new syntactic objects, that
is, shadings by Venn, and &lsquo;x&rsquo;s, &lsquo;o&rsquo;s, and
lines by Peirce. However, on the negative side, these revised systems
suffer from a loss of visual clarity, as seen above, mainly because of
the introduction of more arbitrary conventions. The modifications from
Peirce to Shin diagrams concentrate on restoring visual clarity, but
without loss of expressive power.</p>

<p>
Hammer and Shin take a different path from these revisions: To revive
Euler&rsquo;s homomorphic relation between circles and
sets&mdash;containment among circles represents the subset relation
among sets, and non-overlapping of regions represents the disjoint
relation&mdash;and at the same time, to adopt Venn&rsquo;s primary
diagrams by default. On the other hand, this revised Euler system is
not a self-sufficient tool for syllogistic reasoning, since it cannot
represent existential statements. For more details of this revised
system, refer to (Hammer &amp; Shin
 <a href="#hammershin">1998</a>).</p>
 
<p>
This case study raises an interesting question for further research on
diagrammatic reasoning. Throughout the different developments of Euler
diagrams, increasing its expressive power and enhancing its visual
clarity seem to be complementary to each other. Depending on purposes,
we need to give priority to one over the other. Hammer and
Shin&rsquo;s alternative system provides a simple model for the
development of other efficient non-sentential representational
systems, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention in
computer science and cognitive science.</p>

<h3 id="EucBey">3.2 Euclid and Beyond</h3>

<p>
Mathematicians have used, and continue to use, diagrams extensively.
The communication of mathematical concepts and proofs&mdash;in
textbooks, on blackboards&mdash;is not uniformly sentential. Figures
and pictures are common. In line with the prevailing conception of
logic as essentially sentential, however, they have not been thought
to play a role in rigorous mathematical reasoning. From this
perspective, their use is limited to enhancing comprehension of a
proof. They are not part of the proof itself.</p>

<p>
The attitude is well illustrated by the standard 20th century
assessment of Euclid&rsquo;s methodology in the <em>Elements</em>. In
no mathematical subject are diagrams more prominent than in the
elementary geometry Euclid develops in the text. The proofs of the
subject seem to be in some sense about the diagrams of triangles and
circles that appear with them. This is especially the case with the
geometric proofs of the <em>Elements</em>. Diagrams for Euclid are not
merely illustrative. Some of his inference steps depend on an
appropriately constructed diagram. On the standard 20th century story,
these steps indicate gaps in Euclid&rsquo;s proofs. They show how
Euclid did not fully carry out the project of developing geometry
axiomatically.</p>

<p>
Ken Manders set out to explode this story with (2008 [1995]). His
analysis of Euclid&rsquo;s diagrammatic proof method reveals that
Euclid employs diagrams in a controlled, systematic way. It thus calls
into question negative assessments of the rigor of the
<em>Elements</em>. Moreover, the specifics of Manders&rsquo; analysis
suggest that the proofs of the text can be understood to adhere to a
formal diagrammatic logic. This was subsequently confirmed by the
development of formal diagrammatic systems designed to characterize
such a logic. The first of these was <strong>FG</strong> (presented in
Miller
 <a href="#mil07">2007</a>),
 followed by the system <strong>Eu</strong> (Mumma
 <a href="#mumma">2010</a>).</p>
 
<p>
This section is devoted to explicating Manders&rsquo; analysis and the
formal systems that have emerged from it. We first explain how the
analysis lays the groundwork for the project of formalizing
Euclid&rsquo;s diagrammatic proofs. We then discuss how this project
is realized in <strong>FG</strong> and <strong>Eu</strong>.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 Understanding the role of Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams</h4>

<p>
For an example of Euclid&rsquo;s diagrammatic method in action,
consider the proof for proposition 16 of book I of the
<em>Elements</em>.</p>

<p>
The proposition is:</p>

<blockquote>
In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle
is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.
</blockquote>

<p>
Euclid&rsquo;s proof is:</p>

<blockquote>
<img alt="A triangle ABC with the segment BC extending to point D and a line BF that intersects segment AC" src="euclid-a.png" style="float:right; padding:1em; width:300px" />

<ul>

<li>Let ABC be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be produced to
D;</li>

<li>I say that the angle ACD is greater than the interior and opposite
angle BAC.</li>

<li>Let AC be bisected at E [I, 10], and let BE be joined and produced
in a straight line to F;</li>

<li>let EF be made equal to BE [I,3], and let FC be joined.</li>

<li>Then, since AE is equal to EC, and BE equal to EF, the two sides
AE, EB are equal to the two sides CE, EF respectively; and the angle
AEB is equal to the angle FEC [I, 15].</li>

<li>Therefore the base AB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle
ABE is equal to the triangle CFE [I,4];therefore the angle BAE is
equal to the angle ECF (which is also the angle ACF);</li>

<li>But the angle ACD is greater than the angle ACF;</li>

<li>Therefore the angle ACD is greater than BAE.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the usual approach, logical analysis of the proof requires
situating it within an axiomatic theory of elementary geometry. Such a
theory specifies the subject&rsquo;s primitive undefined concepts and
its fundamental unproven truths. The canonical first order theory
fulfilling this foundational role is that presented in
 <a href="#Tarski">Tarski, 1959</a>.
 Developed by Alfred Tarski in the tradition of David Hilbert&rsquo;s
epochal axiomatization
 <a href="#Hilbert">1899</a>,
 the theory has two primitives: a three-place relation of betweenness
and a four-place relation of segment congruence. To analyze the proof
of I,16 with it, the proof&rsquo;s premises and conclusion are first
formulated in terms of betweenness and segment congruence. A
derivation of the latter from the former is then constructed. The
derivation presents the logic of the reasoning as completely
diagram-free. It consists, specifically, of a tree of first order
formulas linked to one another other by sound, topic neutral
derivation rules.</p>

<p>
Though carrying such an analysis is not a trivial task&mdash;the
details take some thought to work out&mdash;the general character of
what the analysis yields is clear. We obtain a depiction of the proof
in which steps of reasoning proceed from geometrical statements to
geometrical statements via precisely defined derivation rules. The
clarity and precision of this picture was taken in the 20th century to
contrast sharply with Euclid&rsquo;s original diagrammatic proof. The
diagram was viewed as a free-floating illustration, to be consulted
whenever there was no other way to reach a conclusion, rather than
something a with a definite and principled role in the proof&rsquo;s
reasoning.</p>

<p>
What Manders shows in
 <a href="#manders">2008 [1995]</a>
 is that diagrams have in fact a definite and principled role in the
proofs of ancient geometry. Central to his account is the distinction
between the exact and co-exact properties of geometric diagrams. The
co-exact conditions realized by a diagram &lsquo;are those conditions
which are unaffected by some range of every continuous variation of a
specified diagram.&rsquo; Exact conditions, in contrast, are affected
once the diagram is subject to the smallest variation. Roughly, a
diagram&rsquo;s co-exact properties comprise the ways its parts define
a finite set of planar regions, and the containment relations between
these regions. The paradigm exact relation is the equality of two
magnitudes within a diagram. For example, only the slightest change to
the position of CF in the diagram for proposition 16 is required to
make the angles BAE and ECF unequal.</p>

<p>
Manders&rsquo; key observation is that Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams
contribute to proofs <em>only</em> through their co-exact properties.
Euclid never infers an exact property from a diagram unless it follows
directly from a co-exact property. Relations between magnitudes which
are not exhibited as a containment are either assumed from the outset
or are proved via a chain of inferences in the text. This can easily
be confirmed with the proof of proposition 16. The one inference that
relies on the diagram is the second to last inference of the proof.
The inference, specifically, is that angle ACD is greater than angle
ACF. This, crucially, is based on seeing from the diagram that angle
ACD <em>contains</em> angle ACF. There are many other relations
asserted to hold in the proof. Though the diagram instantiates them,
they are explicitly justified in the text. And with these relations,
the relata are spatially separated magnitudes.</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to hypothesize why Euclid would have restricted
himself in such a way. It is only in their capacity to represent
co-exact properties and relations that diagrams seem capable of
functioning effectively as symbols of proof. The exact properties of
diagrams are too refined to be easily reproducible and to support
determinate judgments. As Manders puts it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The practice has resources to limit the risk of disagreement on
(explicit) co-exact attributions from a diagram; but it lacks such
resources for exact attributions, and therefore could not allow them
without dissolving into a disarray of irresolvably conflicting
judgements. (Manders
 <a href="#manders">2008 [1995]</a>:
 91&ndash;92)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Manders&rsquo; insights lead naturally to the idea that Euclid&rsquo;s
arguments could be formalized in a manner similar to the way Venn
diagrams have been formalized in Shin
 <a href="#shin94">1994</a>.
 The co-exact information carried by Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams is
discrete. When a diagram is consulted for this information, what
matters about it is how its lines and circles partition a bounded
planar region into a finite set of sub-regions. This opens the door to
conceptualizing Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams as part of the <em>syntax</em>
of Euclid&rsquo;s proof method.</p>

<p>
Realizing this conception in a formal system of proof amounts, as in
Shin
 <a href="#shin94">1994</a>,
 to specifying the syntax and semantics of diagrams. On the syntactic
side, this means defining Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams as formal objects
precisely, and giving rules whereby diagrams as formal object figure
in derivations of Euclid&rsquo;s propositions. On the semantic side,
this means specifying how derivable expressions are to be interpreted
geometrically, or in other words how exactly are they to be understood
as representing Euclid&rsquo;s propositions.</p>

<p>
The semantic situation with Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams is thus different
from that with Venn&rsquo;s. Venn diagrams are used to prove
<em>logical</em> results. The inferences made with them are topic
neutral. Euclid&rsquo;s diagrams on the other hand are used to prove
<em>geometrical</em> results. The inferences made with them are topic
specific. In particular, though the objects of plane Euclidean
geometry are abstract (e.g., geometric lines are breadthless), they
are still spatial. Consequently, issues surrounding the spatiality of
diagrams and representational scope do not arise with Euclid&rsquo;s
diagrams as they do, for instance, with Euler diagrams. In the case of
geometry, in fact, the spatiality of diagrams counts in their favor.
Spatial constraints on what is possible with geometric configurations
are also operative with spatial Euclidean diagrams.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, as recognized in the philosophical commentary on
Euclid&rsquo;s geometry from antiquity onward, there are with
Euclidean diagrams issues of representational scope to contend with.
What is the justification for treating properties of a single
geometric diagram as representative of all the configurations in the
range of a proof? How can a single diagram prove a general result?
Manders&rsquo; exact/co-exact distinction provides the basis for a
partial answer. The co-exact properties of a diagram can be shared by
all geometric configurations in the range of a proof, and so in such
cases one is justified in reading off co-exact properties from the
diagram. In a proof about triangles for instance, variation among the
configurations in the range of the proof is variation of exact
properties&mdash;e.g., the measure of the triangles&rsquo; angles, the
ratios between their sides. They all share the same co-exact
properties&mdash;i.e., they all consists of three bounded linear
regions which together define an area.</p>

<p>
This is not a full answer because Euclid&rsquo;s proofs typically
involve constructions on an initial configuration type. With the proof
of proposition 16, for example, a construction on a triangle with one
side extended is specified. In such cases, a diagram may adequately
represent the co-exact properties of an initial configuration. But the
result of applying a proof&rsquo;s construction to the diagram cannot
be assumed to represent the co-exact properties of all configurations
resulting from the construction. One does not need to consider complex
geometric situations to see this. Suppose for instance the initial
configuration type of a proof is <em>triangle</em>. Then the
diagram</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:center">
<img alt="a triangle (an acute triangle)" src="euclid-b.png" style="width:150px" />
</blockquote>

<p>
serves to represent the co-exact properties of this type. Suppose
further that the first step of a proof&rsquo;s construction is to drop
the perpendicular from a vertex of the triangle to the line containing
the side opposite the vertex. Then the result of carrying this step
out on the diagram</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:center">
<img alt="the same triangle as the previous image with a perpendicular dropped from one vertex" src="euclid-c.png" style="width:150px" />
</blockquote>

<p>
ceases to be representative. That the perpendicular falls within the
triangle in the diagram is a co-exact feature of it. But there are
triangles with exact properties different from the initial diagram
where applying the construction step results in a perpendicular lying
outside the triangle. For example, with the triangle</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:center">
<img alt="An obtuse triangle" src="euclid-d.png" style="width:150px" />
</blockquote>

<p>
the result of applying the construction step is</p>

<blockquote style="text-align:center">
<img alt="An obtuse triangle with a perpendicular dropping from one of the acute angles to the extension of the opposite side of the triangle" src="euclid-e.png" style="width:200px" />
</blockquote>

<h4>3.2.2 Formalizing Euclid&rsquo;s Diagrammatic Logic</h4>

<p>
Manders&rsquo; account of Euclid&rsquo;s diagrammatic method provides
the broad outlines for formalizing it. Filling in the details amounts
to carrying out two main tasks. The first is to define geometric
diagrams as formal proof symbols, and the second is to specify a
method for proving results with geometric diagrams so
characterized.</p>

<p>
<strong>Task 1: defining formal geometric diagrams.</strong> As
mentioned above, the definition of geometric diagrams as formal proof
symbols must specify their syntax and semantics. The formal objects
satisfying the first syntactic part of the definition model the actual
physical geometric diagrams produced with Euclid&rsquo;s proofs. The
second, semantic part of the definition codifies Manders&rsquo; notion
of co-exactness with respect to these objects via an equivalence
relation. The properties and relations that a formal diagram shares
with all diagrams equivalent to express the geometric information it
carries as a proof symbol.</p>

<p>
The syntax of <strong>FG</strong> diagrams is purely topological. Its
linear elements (segments, rays and lines) and circles are sets of
one-dimensional bounded curves within a rectangular two dimensional
frame. The conditions on a well-formed <strong>FG</strong> diagram
guarantee that these sets have the expected topological
properties&mdash;e.g. set representing a line does not self-intersect,
a set representing a circle forms a simple closed curve, the sets
representing two distinct lines intersect in at most one point, and so
on. For the details see section 3.1 of chapter 2 in Miller
 <a href="#mil07">2007</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The conditions <strong>Eu</strong> imposes on its lines and circles
are not, in contrast, purely topological. An <strong>Eu</strong>
diagram has as a background a coordinatized \(n \times n\) array,
where n is any natural number greater than 2. An <strong>Eu</strong>
point is a distinguished array element and <strong>Eu</strong> linear
elements and circles are sets of array elements. The linearity of
linear elements and convexity of circles is guaranteed by the
equations and inequalities theses sets are required to satisfy. For
the details see section 3.1 of Mumma
 <a href="#mumma2">2019</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The range of distinct co-exact configurations stipulated by the
<strong>FG </strong>notion of diagram equivalence is not exactly the
same as that stipulated by the <strong>Eu</strong> notion. The main
difference between them stems from how segments are understood in both
systems. An <strong>FG</strong> segment is not taken to define regions
on either side of it while an <strong>Eu</strong> segment is. It is
only when an <strong>FG</strong> segment is extended to a line that
regions above and below the segment are depicted. Further,
<strong>FG</strong> lines are interpreted as representing infinite
lines, while <strong>Eu</strong> lines are interpreted as depicting
the extendibility of segments. This has consequences for how
parallelism is treated in both systems. See section 3.2.2 of Mumma
 <a href="#mumma2">2019</a>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Taks 2: prescribing a diagrammatic method of geometric
proof.</strong> Situating the formally defined diagrams like those of
<strong>FG</strong> and <strong>Eu</strong> in a formal geometric
proof system requires two things. The first is a technique for
expressing a configuration&rsquo;s exact information in conjunction
with the co-exact information expressed by a diagram. The second is a
method for distinguishing general co-exact features from non-general
ones in diagrammatic representations of constructions.</p>

<p>
The first requirement is met in <strong>FG</strong> by expressing
equalities between magnitudes depicted in a diagram via markings of
segments and angles in line with the familiar convention where
distinct segments or angles with the same angle are understood as
equal. <strong>Eu</strong> in contrast is a heterogeneous system, with
a sentential as well as a diagrammatic syntax. <strong>Eu</strong>
sentences expressing equalities and inequalities between magnitudes
are related to the diagrams depicting the magnitudes via labels. For
examples of these two methods of representation with respect to I, 16,
see figure 6.</p>

</div>

<p>
In each system formulating proofs rules for reasoning about exact
information with its specific way of representing it is
straightforward. Less straightforward is formulating the proof rules
that govern the inference of co-exact information from diagrams. The
core difference between <strong>FG</strong> and <strong>Eu</strong> is
with respect to these rules. As illustrated in the example in 3.2.1,
the central issue is the potential of a geometric diagram to display
co-exact relations that are not shared by all configurations in the
scope of a proof after a construction step is applied. A formal method
for reasoning about geometric constructions represented with diagrams
must guarantee that only co-exact relations that are shared by all
configurations in the scope of a proof play a role.</p>

<p>
An approach that naturally suggests itself is akin to Euler&rsquo;s
treatment of example 3 in section 3.1.1: produce with each
construction step all the co-exact configurations that could result
from it. This is the method prescribed by <strong>FG</strong>.
Performing the construction of one of Euclid&rsquo;s proofs on an
<strong>FG</strong> diagram results, in general, in an array of
diagrams depicting all of the construction&rsquo;s possible co-exact
cases. A general co-exact relation of the construction is then one
that appears in every case. <strong>FG</strong>&rsquo;s demand that
every case be produced would, of course, be of a little interest if it
did not also provide a method for producing them all. The method
<strong>FG</strong> provides depends on the fact that lines and
circles in the system&rsquo;s diagrams are defined in purely
topological terms. Their resulting flexibility makes it possible to
formulate and implement in a computer program a general method for
generating cases.
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It turns out that the proof of I,16 can be represented in
<strong>FG</strong> without any case branching if the sides of the
initially given triangle in a <strong>FG</strong> diagram are extended
to the frame. (Otherwise topologically coherent but geometrically
uninterpretable cases would result, and the key co-exact relation of
the containment of ACF in ACD would not be inferable.) A proof in the
<em>Elements</em> whose representation in <strong>FG</strong> does
necessitate a fair amount of case branching is that of I,2. This is
due to proof&rsquo;s construction having two steps where circles are
drawn. Performing these steps in <strong>FG</strong> means producing
cases for all possible positions of points (inside, on, outside) in
the diagram with respect to the circles.</p>

<p>
The lines and circles of <strong>Eu</strong> diagrams are not flexible
like those of <strong>FG</strong>. Consequently, it cannot resolve the
generality problem via case-analysis as <strong>FG</strong> does. It
seeks instead to formalize a process in which a reasoner confirms with
a single given diagram that select relations depicted in it are
general. A reasoner who employs Euler diagrams in this way would not,
for instance, produce three separate diagrammatic representations of
the premises of the syllogism of example 3. She would instead first
represent it in one of the three possible ways. She would then confirm
that the relation between B to the part of C in A is general while
also recognizing the relation of B to the part of C outside of A can
vary. (David Waszek argues for this understanding Euler&rsquo;s
diagrammatic method in this way, and provides explicit rules codifying
it, in
 <a href="#Waszek18"> 2018</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Accordingly, in the picture of diagrammatic reasoning underlying
<strong>Eu</strong>, there are two kinds of acts: 1) the production of
a single diagram representing what is explicitly stipulated in the
proof or problem; 2) the extraction of content from the single diagram
produced. <strong>Eu</strong> thus has two kinds of rules regulating
its diagrammatic syntax in derivations. Its <em>construction
rules</em> govern acts of kind 1) and its <em>positional rules</em>
govern acts of kind 2). Formally, the positional rules have as input
and output sub-diagrams of the diagram produced by the construction of
a derivation. The derivation of a sub-diagram via a positional rule
means that all the co-exact relations that it depicts are general.</p>

<p>
For example, to derive I, 16 in <strong>Eu</strong>, we first produce
the <strong>Eu</strong> diagram</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Eu for I, 16" src="fig-7a.png" style="width:135px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 7a</span></p>
</div>

<p>
via its construction rules. We then apply positional rules repeatedly
to obtain the sub-diagram</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Eu for I, 16" src="fig-7b.png" style="width:130px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 7b</span></p>
</div>

<p>
and then apply a rule for deriving inequalities from diagrams to
obtain ACF \(\lt\)
 ACD.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Generally, the approach of <strong>Eu</strong> allows for less cases
to be considered. In its representation of the proof of I, 2, for
example, one can confirm that the co-exact relations necessary for the
proof to go through without taking into account the various ways the
proof&rsquo;s points and circles can relate.</p>

<p>
The differences between the <strong>FG</strong> and
<strong>Eu</strong> approaches to formalizing Euclid&rsquo;s
constructions can be understood as representing different general
conceptions of the role of diagrams in mathematics.
<strong>FG</strong> embodies a conception where diagrams concretely
realize a range of mathematical possibilities. They support
mathematical inference by furnishing direct access to these
possibilities. <strong>Eu</strong> in contrast embodies a conception
where diagrams serve to represent in a single symbol the various
components of a complex mathematical situation. They support
mathematical inference by allowing the mathematical reasoner to
consider all these components in one place, and to focus on those
components relevant to a proof.</p>

<h3 id="OthDiaSys">3.3 Other Diagrammatic Systems</h3>

<p>
It is worth noting that many mathematicians and philosophers proposed
diagrammatic systems, often with a didactic motivation. Some systems,
like Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s in &ldquo;The Game of Logic&rdquo;
 (<a href="#carroll">1896</a>)
 are variants on the proposals of Euler and Venn. Others, like Frege
 (<a href="#frege">1879</a>),
 used lines rather than plane regions. (For a description of
Frege&rsquo;s notation, see the section on Complex Statements and
Generality in the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/" target="other">Gottlob Frege</a>.
 See also Englebretsen
 <a href="#engle92">1992</a>.)
 Carroll&rsquo;s system supersedes Venn&rsquo;s in that the
complements of sets are explicitly represented as regions of the
diagram, rather than being left as the background region against which
the circles appear. This means that Carroll&rsquo;s system is able to
draw inferences about relations between complements of properties, at
the expense of representing some properties as disjoint (i.e.,
non-connected) regions. This shift closely mirrors the shift in logic
from subject-predicate argumentation to a function-argument
representation (Stenning
 <a href="#stenning99">1999</a>).
 In the tradition of the work of Venn and Carroll, Frank Thomas
Sautter presents four new diagrammatic systems for syllogistic
reasoning and discusses them in relation to the systems of Venn and
Carroll in
 <a href="#Sautter2019">2019</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Peirce, a founder of modern quantified logic, also invented a
graphical system, called Existential Graphs, which is logically
equivalent to predicate logic. Along with Don Robert&rsquo;s
pioneering work on Existential Graphs and John Sowa&rsquo;s creative
application of Peirce&rsquo;s graphs, a group of diagrammatic
researchers provided more diverse approaches to Existential Graphs in
a broader theoretical context (Shin
 <a href="#shin03">2003</a>).</p>
 
<p>
On a more practical theme, AI researchers, one of whose main concerns
is the heuristic power of representation systems in addition to their
expressive power, have been debating about different forms of
representation for decades (Sloman
 <a href="#sloman71">1971</a>,
 <a href="#sloman85">1985</a>,
 <a href="#sloman95">1995</a>).
 Hence, they have welcomed discussions of the distinct role of visual
reasoning and have hosted interdisciplinary symposiums on diagrammatic
reasoning at AI
 conferences.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 At the same time, realizing that human beings adopt different
representation forms depending on the kinds of problems they face,
some AI researchers and design theorists have practiced
domain-specific approaches to bringing in problem-tailored
representation
 forms.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
For instance, Harel
 (<a href="#harel">1988</a>)
 invented higraphs to represent system specifications in computer
science. This idea has been taken up in industrial applications (e.g.,
UML, in Booch et al.
 <a href="#BRJ98">1998</a>).
 Barker-Plummer &amp; Bailin
 (<a href="#dbp97">1997</a>)
 present a case study in developing computers which can carry out the
kind of analogical reasoning that humans perform when proving certain
mathematical theorems. Along these lines, an interesting result was
presented by Mateja Jamnik of Alan Bundy&rsquo;s Mathematical
Reasoning Group at Edinburgh (Jamnik
 <a href="#jam2001">2001</a>).
 Jamnik shows how a semi-automatic formal proof system can perform
some of the perceptual inferences which humans find so natural. For
instance, that the sum of the first \(n\) odd natural numbers is \(n\)
squared is easily seen by decomposing an \(n \times n\) grid into
&ldquo;ells&rdquo; (Jamnik et al.
 <a href="#jam99">1999</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Scholars at the University of Brighton has been carrying out
interesting projects both in developing diagrammatic systems and in
applying visual tools in software development, see the link in the
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources section</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="DiaPro">4. Diagrammatic Properties</h2>

<p>
While it is often possible to afford diagrams the same logical status
as formulae (as argued above), there are still important differences
(which can have ramifications for correctness of the system) between
diagrams and traditional linear proof calculi. An important point to
note about diagrams (cf. Russell
 <a href="#rus23">1923</a>)
 is that spatial relations between objects in a diagram can be used to
represent relations between objects in some other domain. Sequential
languages (e.g., symbolic logics, natural languages), however, use
only the relation of concatenation to represent relations between
objects. The peculiar representational use of spatial relations in the
case of diagrams is direct and intuitive, as seen in the development
of Euler Diagrams above, but also has its perils&mdash;as we shall
discuss. Spatial constraints, being peculiar to diagrammatic systems,
can be expected to be an important source of both their strengths and
weaknesses. Psychological considerations concerning human capacities
for visual processing of information, and skill at qualitative spatial
reasoning, also have ramifications for the effectiveness of reasoning
with diagrams, but we shall not survey them here at length. In the
last subsection we outline some aspects of cognitive role of diagrams
in connection with mental representation perspective.</p>

<p>
A particular distinguishing feature of diagrams is that they obey
certain &ldquo;nomic&rdquo; or &ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; constraints due
to their use of plane surfaces as a medium of representation. The idea
is that sentential languages are based on acoustic signals which are
sequential in nature, and so must have a compensatingly complex syntax
in order to express certain relationships&mdash;whereas diagrams,
being two-dimensional, are able to display some relationships without
the intervention of a complex syntax (Stenning &amp; Lemon
 <a href="#sl97ii">2001</a>).
 Diagrams exploit this possibility&mdash;the use of spatial relations
to represent other relations. The question is; how well can spatial
relations and objects represent other (possibly more abstract) objects
and relations?</p>

<p>
Logical reasoning with diagrams is often carried out in virtue of
their depiction of all possible models of a situation, up to
topological equivalence of the diagrams (this, of course, depends on
the particular diagrammatic system in use). A single diagram is often
an abstraction over a class of situations, and once a suitable diagram
has been constructed, inferences can simply be read off the
representation without any further manipulation. Examples and our
discussions in section 3 nicely illustrate this point. In some
diagrammatic systems (e.g., Euler Circles) inference is carried out by
constructing diagrams correctly and reading information off them. The
complexity of using inference rules in a symbolic logic is, in these
cases, replaced by the problem of drawing particular diagrams
 correctly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 For instance, an Euler Circles diagram ventures to capture
relationships between sets using topological relationships between
plane regions in such a way that that it depicts all the possible ways
that a certain collection of set-theoretic statements could be true.
This has two important consequences: (1) if a certain diagram cannot
be drawn then the described situation must be impossible (termed
&ldquo;self-consistency&rdquo;), and (2) if a certain relationship
between diagram objects must be drawn, then the corresponding relation
can be inferred as logically valid. (See the numerous examples in
 <a href="#DiaForSys">Section 3</a>.)
 This phenomenon is often termed a &ldquo;free-ride&rdquo; (Barwise
&amp; Shimojima
 <a href="#barshim95">1995</a>).
 This style of diagrammatic reasoning is thus dependent on a
particular representational use of diagrams&mdash;that they represent
classes of models. If a particular class of models cannot be
represented by a diagrammatic system, then those cases will not be
taken into account in inferences using the system, and incorrect
inferences might be drawn. This fact makes the representational
adequacy of diagrammatic systems, restricted by their spatial nature,
of paramount importance, as we shall now explore.</p>

<h3 id="LimDiaRepRea">4.1 Limitations on Diagrammatic Representation and Reasoning</h3>

<p>
The representational use of the spatial relations in the plane
constrains diagrammatic representation, and therefore reasoning with
diagrams, in certain important ways. In particular, there are
topological and geometrical (let us lump them together as
&ldquo;spatial&rdquo;) properties of diagrammatic objects and
relations which limit the expressive power of diagrammatic systems.
For instance, in graph theory it is known that some simple structures
cannot be drawn in the plane. For example, the graph \(K_5\) is the
graph consisting of 5 nodes, each joined to the other by an arc. This
graph is non-planar, meaning that it cannot be drawn without at least
two of the arcs crossing. This is just the sort of constraint on
possible diagrams that limits the expressive power of diagrammatic
systems. Now, since diagrammatic reasoning can occur by enumeration of
all possible models of a situation, this representational inadequacy
(a type of incompleteness) renders many diagrammatic systems incorrect
if they are used for logical reasoning (e.g., see the critique of
Englebretsen
 <a href="#engle92">1992</a>
 in Lemon &amp; Pratt
 <a href="#ndcrit">1998</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Perhaps the most simple example of this is due to Lemon and Pratt (see
e.g.,
 <a href="#lempr97b">1997</a>).
 Consider Euler Circles&mdash;where convex regions of the plane
represent sets, and overlap of the regions represents non-empty
intersection of the corresponding sets. A result of convex topology
known as Helly&rsquo;s Theorem states (for the 2 dimensional case)
that if every triple of 4 convex regions has a non-empty intersection
then all four regions must have a non-empty intersection.</p>

<p>
To understand the ramifications of this, consider the following
problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Example 4</strong>. Using Euler Circles, represent the
following premises:

<ul>

<li>\(A \cap B \cap C \ne \varnothing\)</li>

<li>\(B \cap C \cap D \ne \varnothing\)</li>

<li>\(C \cap D \cap A \ne \varnothing\)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that, in terms of set-theory, only trivial consequences follow
from these premises. However, an Euler diagram of the premises, such
as Figure 8, leads to the incorrect conclusion that \(A \cap B \cap C
\cap D \ne \varnothing\) (due to the quadruple overlap region in the
centre of the diagram):</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="Four overlapping circles labeled &lsquo;A&rsquo;, &lsquo;B&rsquo;, &lsquo;C&rsquo;, and &lsquo;D&rsquo;" src="fig-8.png" style="width:200px" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figure">Figure 8</span>: An Euler&rsquo;s Circles
representation exhibiting Helly&rsquo;s Theorem</p>
</div>

<p>
In other words, a user of Euler Circles is
 forced<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 to represent a relationship between the sets which is not logically
necessary. This means both that there are logically possible
situations which the system cannot represent, and that a user would
make incorrect inferences if they relied on the system for reasoning.
More generally, this type of result can be generated for many
different types of diagrammatic system, depending on the particular
spatial relations and objects which they use in representation&mdash;a
research programme which is ongoing.</p>

<p>
For example, using non-convex regions (e.g., &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;
instead of circles) leads to a similar problem, only that non-planar
graphs are involved instead of Helly&rsquo;s Theorem. A similar result
concerns linear diagrams for syllogisms Englebretsen
 <a href="#engle92">1992</a>,
 where lines are used to represent sets, points represent individuals,
point-line intersection represents set-membership, and intersection of
lines represents set-intersection. Again, planarity constraints
restrict the expressive power of the system and lead to incorrect
inferences.</p>

<p>
Atsushi Shimojima&rsquo;s &ldquo;constraint hypothesis&rdquo; perhaps
best sums all this up:</p>

<blockquote>
Representations are objects in the world, and as such they obey
certain structural constraints that govern their possible formation.
The variance in inferential potential of different modes of
representation is largely attributable to different ways in which
these structural constraints on representations match with the
constraints on targets of representation (Shimojima
 <a href="#shim96a">1996a</a>,
 <a href="#shim99">1999</a>).
 </blockquote>

<h3 id="EffDia">4.2 Efficacy of Diagrams</h3>

<p>
As discussed above, much of the interest in diagrams has been
generated by the claim that they are somehow more
&ldquo;effective&rdquo; than traditional logical representations for
certain types of task. Certainly, for example, a map is a greater aid
to navigation than a verbal description of a landscape. However, while
there are certainly psychological advantages to be gained through the
use of diagrams, they are (as in the case of Euler Circles) often
ineffective as representations of abstract objects and relationships.
Once a purely intuitive notion, non-psychological claims about
&ldquo;efficacy&rdquo; of diagrammatic systems can be examined in
terms of standard formal properties of languages (Lemon et al.
 <a href="#jolli99">1999</a>).
 In particular, many diagrammatic systems are self-consistent,
incorrect, and incomplete, and complexity of inference with the
diagrams is NP-hard. By way of contrast, most sentential logics, while
able to express inconsistencies, are complete and
 correct<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 .</p>

<p>
On the other hand, not being able to represent contradictions could
provide us with interesting insights about the nature of diagrammatic
representation. If a central goal of a language is to represent the
world or a state of affairs, then representing contradictions or
tautologies is called into question. Neither contradictions nor
tautologies are part of the world. How can we draw a picture, or take
a picture, of the contradiction that &ldquo;it is raining and it is
not raining&rdquo;? How about the picture of the disjunctive
information &ldquo;it is either raining or not raining&rdquo;? Now, we
seem to be much closer to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s classic picture theory
of language (Wittgenstein
 <a href="#tractatus">1921</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="CogRolDia">4.3 The Cognitive Role of Diagrams</h3>

<p>
One might locate a special role of diagrammatic reasoning in the
relation between mental representation and diagrams. We have been
alluding this relation in a couple of times in the above.</p>

<p>
Do our mental representations have diagram-like or picture-like
entities as components? This question has a long history both in
philosophy and in psychology, independently of each other. More
recently, however, some philosophers have participated in this
&ldquo;imagery debate&rdquo;, one of the most time-honored
controversies in psychology, and some cognitive psychologists find
certain epistemological theories in philosophy useful to support their
views on the issue.</p>

<p>
The nature of mental representation has been one of the perennial
topics in philosophy, and we can easily trace back philosophical
discussions on images and mental representation to ancient
 times.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 The writings of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume concern themselves
in large part with mental discourse, the meaning of words, mental
images, particular ideas, abstract ideas, impressions, and so on.
Descartes&rsquo; well-known distinction between imagining and
conceiving something has generated much discussion about the unique
role of visual images in mental representations. The development of
cognitive science in the 20th century naturally has brought certain
group of philosophers and psychologists closer and we find a number of
authors whose works easily belong to both disciplines (Block
 <a href="#block83">1983</a>;
 Dennett
 <a href="#den81">1981</a>;
 Fodor
 <a href="#fodor81">1981</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Imagery based on introspection was the main focus in the early
development of psychology until the behavioristic approach became
predominant in the discipline. During the era of behaviorism, anything
related to mental inspection, including images, was excluded from any
serious research agenda. Finally when the topic of mental images made
a comeback in psychology in 1960s, researchers adopted a more humble
agenda for mental imagery than before: Not all mental representations
involve imagery, and imagery is one of many ways of manipulating
information in the mind. Also, thanks to the influence of behaviorism,
it is acknowledged that introspection is not enough to explore
imagery, but a claim about mental imagery needs to be confirmable by
experiments in order to show that we successfully externalize mental
events. That is, if what a certain mental introspection tells us is
genuine, then there would be observable external consequences of that
mental state.</p>

<p>
Thus the contemporary imagery debate among cognitive scientists is
about the claim that picture-like images exist as mental
representations and about how we interpret certain
 experiments.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Kosslyn
 (<a href="#kos80">1980</a>,
 <a href="#kos94">1994</a>)
 and other pictorialists (Shepard &amp; Metzler
 <a href="#shepmetz">1971</a>)
 present experimental data to support their position that some of our
mental images are more like pictures than a linear form of language
(for example, natural languages or artificial symbolic languages) in
some important aspects, even though not all visual mental images and
pictures are of exactly the same kind. By contrast, Pylyshyn
 (<a href="#pyl81">1981</a>)
 and other descriptionalists (Dennett
 <a href="#den81">1981</a>)
 raise questions about the picture-like status of mental images and
argue that mental images are formed out of structured descriptions. To
them, mental images represent in the manner of language rather than
pictures and, hence, there are no picture-like visual mental
images.</p>

<p>
Both sides of the debate sometimes used a philosophical theory as a
supporting factor. For example, pictorialists in the imagery debate
found the modern sense-datum theory in philosophy quite close to their
point of view. By the same token, the critics of the sense-datum
theory argued that the mistaken pictorial view of mental images arises
mainly from our confusion about ordinary language and claimed that
mental images are epiphenomena.</p>

<p>
Without being heavily involved in the imagery debate, some researchers
have focused on a distinct role that diagrams or pictures&mdash;as
opposed to traditional sentential forms&mdash;play in our cognitive
activities. (Shin
 <a href="#shin15">2015</a>;
 Hamami &amp; J. Mumma
 <a href="#hamu2013">2013</a>)
 Based on the conjectures that humans adopt diagrammatic or spatial
internal mental representations in their reasoning about concrete or
abstract situations (see Howell
 <a href="#how76">1976</a>;
 Sober
 <a href="#sob76">1976</a>),
 some cognitive scientists have concentrated on the functions of
images or diagrams in our various cognitive activities, for example,
memory, imagination, perception, navigation, inference,
problem-solving, and so on. Here, the distinct nature of &ldquo;visual
information,&rdquo; which is obtained either through internal mental
images or through externally drawn diagrams, has become a major topic
of research. Even though most of these works assume that there are
mental images (that is, they accept the pictorialists&rsquo; claim),
strictly speaking they do not have to commit themselves to the view
that these images exist as basic units in our cognition.
Descriptionalists do not have to discard discussions of the functions
of images, but only need to add that these images are not primitive
units stored in our memory, but formed out of structured descriptions
more like the sentences of a language (see Pylyshyn
 <a href="#pyl81">1981</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A search for the distinct role of diagrams has led researchers to
explore the differences among different forms of external or internal
representations, and mainly between diagrammatic and sentential
representations. Many important results have been produced in
cognitive science. Starting from Larkin and Simon&rsquo;s classic case
study
 (<a href="#larksim">1987</a>)
 to illustrate a difference between informational and computational
equivalence among representation systems as discussed in section 3.1,
Lindsay&rsquo;s work locates where this computational difference lies,
which he calls a &lsquo;non-deductive&rsquo; method. As briefly
pointed out above, this inference process is called &lsquo;free
ride&rsquo; by Barwise and Shimojiima
 (<a href="#barshim95">1995</a>),
 i.e., the kind of an inference in which the conclusion seems to be
read off automatically from the representation of premises. In Gurr,
Lee, and Stenning
 (<a href="#gls98">1998</a>)
 and Stenning and Lemon
 (<a href="#sl97ii">2001</a>),
 there is an explanation of the uniqueness of diagrammatic inference
in terms of a degree of &lsquo;directness&rsquo; of interpretation,
and it is argued that this property is relative, and hence that
&ldquo;some rides are cheaper than others&rdquo;. Having the role of
graphs in mind, Wang and Lee
 (<a href="#wanglee">1993</a>)
 present a formal framework as a guideline for correct visual
languages. At this point, we are very close to applied aspects of
research in multi-modal reasoning&mdash;design theory and AI
research&mdash;by providing these disciplines with computational
support for visual reasoning.</p>

<p>
Related to the issue of imagistic mental representation is the
examination of the semantics of various diagrammatic systems and what
they can teach us about the nature of languages in general (e.g.,
Goodman
 <a href="#goodman">1968</a>).
 For instance, Robert Cummins
 (<a href="#cummins96">1996</a>),
 amongst others, argues that too little attention has been given to
diagrammatic representations and that focus on a notion of
&ldquo;structural representation&rdquo; more akin to diagrammatic
representation can help to explicate the nature of representation
itself. We believe that the considerations presented above give us
some empirical handle on this type of claim at least&mdash;depending
on the imagistic objects and relations used, patterns of incorrect
inference should be predictable and detectable. An important, if
little-known, article on this theme is Malinas
 <a href="#mal91">1991</a>.
 Here Malinas explores the concepts of pictorial representation and
&ldquo;truth in&rdquo; a picture via the notion of resemblance, and
considers various semantic puzzles about pictorial representation. He
develops Peacocke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Central Thesis&rdquo; of depiction
(Peacocke
 <a href="#pea87">1987</a>),
 where experienced similarities between properties of pictorial
objects and their referents in the visual field give rise to the
relation of depiction. He goes on to provide a formal semantics for
pictures which is &ldquo;analogous to a semantics for an ideal
language&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="Sum">Summary</h2>

<p>
We began by motivating the philosophical interest of diagrams, by way
of their role in human reasoning and their relation to the study of
language in general, and multi-modal information processing. We then
explained the trade-off between expressive power and visual clarity of
diagrammatic systems, by examining the historical development of
diagram systems from Euler and Venn, through Peirce&rsquo;s work, to
more recent work by Shin and Hammer. Formalization of Euclid&rsquo;s
geometry is presented in detail as well. It was argued that
diagrammatic systems can be afforded the same logical status as
traditional linear proof calculi. Importantly, diagrams have been
adopted without a formal framework. Examining various kinds of
diagrammatic reasoning in different disciplines, we aim to open a new
path for broader multi-modal reasoning research. We then explained
some of the potential pitfalls of diagrammatic representation and
reasoning, by examining spatial constraints on diagrammatic systems
and how they can affect correctness and expressive power. We closed by
surveying other diagrams systems, the interest in diagrams generated
in computer science and cognitive science, and gave an introduction to
the imagery debate in the philosophy of mind.</p>
