<h1>Xenocrates</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jul 25, 2003; substantive revision Wed Sep 3, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
As Diogenes Laertius reports (D.L., IV 14 = T 2 IP), Xenocrates (of
Chalcedon, a city on the Asian side of the Bosporus opposite
Byzantium) became head of the Academy after the death of Speusippus,
in 339/338 (&ldquo;in the second year of the 110th Olympiad&rdquo;).
D.L. adds that he held that position for twenty-five years and died at
82. Accordingly, his life dates are generally given as
396/395&ndash;314/313 BCE.</p>

<p>
On the death of Plato, when Speusippus became head of the Academy,
Xenocrates and Aristotle may have left Athens together at the
invitation of Hermeias of Atarneus (Strabo, <em>Geography</em>, XIII
57), and Xenocrates returned to succeed Speusippus. According to D.L.
(IV 3 = T 21 IP), this was at Speusippus&rsquo; request, while the
<em>Academicorum Index Herculanensis</em> (cols. 6,41&ndash;7,18:
Fleisher 2018, 175&ndash;176 = T 1 IP) tells us that the younger
members of the Academy voted &mdash;for the first time&mdash;and
confirmed Xenocrates (over Heraclides of Pontus and Menedemus of
Pyrrha) by a narrow margin as the first elected head of the school.
These two accounts, although not incompatible, offer two different
versions of the succession, and it does not appear possible to get
behind them to what really happened.</p>

<p>
D.L.&rsquo;s bibliography (IV 11&ndash;14 = T 2 IP) lists over seventy
titles attributed to Xenocrates, none of which survives, not even in
the form of clearly identifiable quotations in other authors. As with
Speusippus, the reconstruction of Xenocrates&rsquo; doctrines depends
heavily on Aristotle who, frustratingly, often refrains from naming
Xenocrates explicitly. Although Aristotle never directly names
Xenocrates when discussing his philosophical views, possible
references to his doctrines are signalled through certain recurring
formulas; for instance, when Aristotle speaks of &ldquo;those who
posited the Forms&rdquo; (a phrase that often includes Plato and
Xenocrates), of &ldquo;those who posited one nature for mathematical
objects and Forms,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;those who defined the soul as
&lsquo;self-moving number&rsquo;&rdquo; (more on this below).</p>

<p>
Throughout this entry, citations of Xenocrates&rsquo; fragments follow
the numbering in Isnardi Parente&rsquo;s revised edition (2012),
hereafter &lsquo;IP&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Sextus Empiricus tells us (<em>Adv. math.</em> I &sect;16 = fr. 1 IP)
that Xenocrates made explicit the tripartite division of philosophy
that was implicit in Plato into &lsquo;physics&rsquo;,
&lsquo;ethics&rsquo;, and &lsquo;logic&rsquo;. This schema later
became canonical in Stoicism and Hellenistic philosophy more
generally. As is standard with this terminology, what we today refer
to as metaphysics and theory of knowledge are subsumed under
&lsquo;physics&rsquo; and &lsquo;logic&rsquo;, respectively.
Sextus&rsquo; report about the standard division of philosophy
transmitted by Xenocrates but ultimately derived from Plato is typical
of much of what we hear about him: Xenocrates appears to have been at
least as concerned to carry on Plato&rsquo;s thought as to promote
ideas of his own.</p>

<p>
Xenocrates&rsquo; system has sometimes been read as anticipating ideas
that would become prominent in the Middle Platonic tradition (e.g.,
Dillon 2003. For an overview of major scholarly approaches to the
material preserved on the Early Academy, see the entry on
 <a href="../speusippus/">Speusippus</a>).
 In this entry, significant focus is placed on Aristotle&rsquo;s
texts, complemented by material preserved by other authors, with less
emphasis on potential continuity with later traditions. What survives
of Xenocrates&rsquo; views is here divided into four sections:
Metaphysics, Xenocrates and the <em>Timaeus</em>, Theory of Knowledge,
and Ethics. The available material is considerably more abundant for
metaphysics, while our sources for epistemology and ethics are far
more limited.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Met">1. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Most of what we can reconstruct about Xenocrates pertains to his
metaphysics. This reconstruction is carried out largely by identifying
views of his that appear in Aristotle&rsquo;s criticisms of the
metaphysical doctrines of his predecessors and contemporaries, and by
chaining these with other texts that can plausibly be taken to concern
Xenocrates&rsquo; own views. The one feature of Xenocrates&rsquo;
system that Aristotle emphasizes the most when presenting his
metaphysics is his postulation of Form-Numbers. Indeed, in
Aristotelian reports, Xenocrates&rsquo; position is often recognisable
alongside those of Plato and Speusippus. Consider, for example, the
beginning of book &Lambda; of the <em>Metaphysics</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
There are three kinds of substance&mdash;one that is sensible (of
which one subdivision is eternal and another is perishable
[&hellip;]); and another that is immovable, and this certain thinkers
assert to be capable of existing apart, some dividing it into two,
others combining the Forms and the objects of mathematics into one
class, and others believing only in the mathematical part of this
class. (Arist., <em>Metaph</em>. &Lambda;1 1069a30&ndash;35 = fr. 26
IP, transl. Ross)
</blockquote>

<p>
In this and similar reports, Aristotle is quite consistent in the way
he presents the positions of Plato and his immediate successors. To
Plato, Aristotle attributes the postulation of Forms alongside
mathematical entities, mentioned here as two distinct classes of
immovable substance. As for Speusippus, Aristotle states that he
admitted the existence of mathematical objects only, having rejected
the existence of Forms. Finally, regarding Xenocrates, Aristotle
reports that he placed Forms and mathematical objects in a single
class. Compare, for instance, how Aristotle frames the issue in book
M:</p>

<blockquote>
Two opinions are held on this subject; it is said that the objects of
mathematics&mdash;i.e. numbers and lines and the like&mdash;are
substances, and again that the Forms are substances. And since some
recognize these as two different classes&mdash;the Forms and the
mathematical numbers&mdash;and some recognize both as having one
nature, while some others say that the mathematical substances are the
only substances, we must consider first the objects of mathematics,
not qualifying them by any other characteristic [&hellip;]. (Arist.,
<em>Metaph</em>. M1 1076a16&ndash;24 = fr. 27 IP, transl. Ross
slightly modified)
</blockquote>

<p>
This version of the Theory of Forms associated with Xenocrates is that
which Aristotle also ascribes to the &lsquo;later&rsquo; Plato (see
Arist., <em>Metaph.</em> M4 1078b10&ndash;12 for the qualification
&lsquo;later&rsquo;), in which the Forms are, in the first instance,
numbers. In trying to understand what Aristotle tells us about
Form-Numbers, it is necessary to bear in mind the fundamental
distinction he draws between Form-Numbers and mathematical numbers:
both are, according to Aristotle, composed of units, but the units
making up Form-Numbers are of a peculiar kind, such that those within
one Form-Number cannot be combined with those from any other. By
contrast, the units of which mathematical numbers are composed can be
freely added and subtracted (Arist. <em>Metaph.</em> M6, 1080a15-b4).
And furthermore, there is only one Form-Number for each of the numbers
2, 3, 4, etc., where there are indefinitely many instances of each
among the mathematical numbers (Arist., <em>Metaph</em>. A6,
987b14&ndash;18). The mathematical numbers are the ones that
mathematicians work with (for example, in performing arithmetical
operations) and this is presumably why they are called
&lsquo;mathematical&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Consistently with what we have seen in the reports introduced above,
Aristotle ascribes to Plato the position that there are both
Form-Numbers and mathematical numbers; to Speusippus that he rejected
Form-Numbers (and with them the entire theory of Forms; see the entry
on
 <a href="../speusippus/">Speusippus</a>).
 The position Aristotle ascribes to Xenocrates is more nuanced. The
core of it is that Xenocrates&rsquo; held that &ldquo;the Forms and
the numbers have the same nature:&rdquo; that is, Form-Numbers and the
mathematical numbers are essentially the same thing (Arist.
<em>Metaph.</em> M8, 1083b1&ndash;8 = fr. 29 IP).</p>

<p>
A series of half a dozen passages in the <em>Metaphysics</em> can, in
consequence of this identification, be associated with Xenocrates
(see, e.g., Arist., <em>Metaph</em>. M6, 1080b21&ndash;30 = frs. 28 IP
and 39 IP; M8, 1083b1&ndash;8 = fr. 47 IP; M9, 1086a5&ndash;11 = fr.
30 IP; N3, 1090b13&ndash;1091a5 = fr. 38 IP, although Isnardi Parente
is sometimes very minimal in identifying which lines refer explicitly
to Xenocrates). From these passages it appears that Xenocrates
considered the distinction between Forms and mathematical numbers
unnecessary and therefore decided to assimilate the latter to the
former, believing that mathematics can be done entirely with
Form-Numbers.</p>

<p>
However, because Aristotle is particularly insistent on the fact that
mathematical operations are rendered impossible by Form-Numbers, we
are, unfortunately, not told more about how Xenocrates envisioned such
operations to be possible, given the incombinability of the units
composing Form-Numbers. For Plato and Speusippus, the addition of 2
and 3 consists in combining a group of units that constitutes the
mathematical 2 with a distinct group of units that constitutes the
mathematical 3 (that numbers are such collections of units is a view
that can still be found later, perhaps most importantly, given his
influence, in Euclid, <em>Elements</em> VII def. 2). Aristotle, too,
understood addition in this way, albeit with a very different
underlying ontology. It is plausible, however, that this approach was
unavailable to Xenocrates, given his postulation of Form-Numbers.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, we do not know how Xenocrates understood addition. One
possibility (Dancy 2021) is that he conceived of it as a kind of map:
if you are on the unique Form-Number 2 and you wish to add the unique
Form-Number 3 to it, you cannot, strictly speaking, do that, but
taking three steps forward in the series will get you to the unique
Form-Number 5, and that is what &lsquo;2 + 3 = 5&rsquo; really means.
Another possibility is that he thought it was through participation
that arithmetical operations became possible. There is, however, no
direct evidence to support any of these conjectures, apart from
Aristotle&rsquo;s repeated complaint (see Arist., <em>Metaph</em>. M6,
1080b28&ndash;30 = fr. 39 IP; M8, 1083b4&ndash;6 = fr. 19 IP; M9,
1086a9&ndash;11 = fr. 30 IP) that Xenocrates actually makes doing
mathematics impossible Or, to put it as Aristotle does elsewhere: that
Xenocrates ends up destroying mathematical number. According to
Aristotle, Xenocrates is not so much explaining addition as explaining
it <em>away</em>.</p>

<p>
The same criticisms levelled at Xenocrates&rsquo; Form-Numbers are,
although more indirectly, directed at his conception of geometrical
items as well. Just as Aristotle complains that not any two units can
compose the Dyad, he also objects that, for Xenocrates, not every
magnitude is divisible into other magnitudes. More broadly, Aristotle
suggests that Xenocrates adjusts the basic assumptions of arithmetic
and geometry to suit the needs of his system, introducing <em>ad
hoc</em> premises instead of deriving conclusions from commonly
accepted mathematical principles. As with arithmetic, with geometry,
too, the underlying concern is that the explanatory order of
mathematics is compromised by the metaphysical and ontological
commitments endorsed by Xenocrates.</p>

<p>
The charge that, according to Xenocrates, &lsquo;not every magnitude
is divisible into other magnitude&rsquo; appears to be motivated by
Xenocrates&rsquo; commitment to the existence of indivisible lines.
Aristotle attributes this view to Plato in <em>Metaphysics</em> A9,
992a20&ndash;22, but Alexander&rsquo;s commentary on the same passage
adds the name of Xenocrates, in a way suggesting that
Xenocrates&rsquo; endorsement of indivisible magnitudes was even more
prominent or widely recognized than Plato&rsquo;s (Alex. Aphr. <em>In
Arist. Metaph.</em>, 120,6&ndash;8 = fr. 49 IP; see also Simplicius
<em>In Arist. De caelo</em>, 563,20&ndash;23= fr. 53 IP, and many
other passages in the commentators in which this ascription occurs:
frs. 54&ndash;67 IP).</p>

<p>
As Proclus understood Xenocrates&rsquo; position, it applied to the
Form of the line rather than to geometrical or physical magnitudes
(Procl. <em>In Tim.</em> II, 245 23&ndash;33 = fr. 67 IP), but this is
very much a minority view. Porphyry, as quoted by Simplicius in the
latter&rsquo;s commentary on the <em>Physics</em> (140,9&ndash;13 =
fr. 60 IP), gives a more general formulation:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;it does not go on to infinity, but stops at some indivisibles
(<em>atoma</em>). These however are not indivisible as being without
parts and smallest, but fissile with regard to quantity and having
parts, but indivisible and primary in form, supposing that there are
certain primary indivisible lines, and the planes from these and
primary solids. (transl. Huby and Taylor)
</blockquote>

<p>
If we are to trust the testimony, Xenocrates might have thought he
could do with the notion of a line what Aristotle was prepared to do
with notions such as <em>man</em>. Aristotle is prepared to say that a
man is indivisible, and thus a suitable unit for the
arithmetician&rsquo;s contemplation, in the sense that if you divide a
man into two parts, what you get is not two men (see Arist.
<em>Metaph.</em> N3, 1078a23&ndash;26). There is no consensus on the
extent to which Xenocrates&rsquo; metaphysical atomism should be
understood as a theory of physical minima (as Plutarch&rsquo;s
testimony also seems to suggest: <em>Quaest</em>. <em>Plat</em>. 8,
1007c = fr. 132 IP). Xenocrates&rsquo; postulation of the indivisible
lines has important implications for his cosmology, as recently
emphasized by Sedley (2021) and Alieva (2021), who explore how his
mathematical and metaphysical commitments inform his broader account
of the structure of the universe and of perceptibles.</p>

<p>
Xenocrates&rsquo; espousal of indivisible magnitudes has led to the
conjecture that the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise <em>On Indivisible
Lines</em> is, at least in part, an attack on him, and that the
arguments recounted in its first chapter in favour of the existence of
indivisible lines, later rebutted in the treatise, might ultimately
derive from Xenocrates. Unfortunately, the arguments are quite
obscure, as the text is not in good shape (an admirably concise
summary of the first four of these arguments may be found in Furley
1967, 105). Some of the arguments owe a lot to Zeno of Elea: that
Xenocrates was influenced by Zeno is only what one would expect, and
is confirmed elsewhere (see esp. the passage from Porphyry cited in
part above, <em>apud</em> Simplicius <em>In Arist. Phys.</em>
140.6&ndash;18. For the connection between Xenocrates&rsquo; arguments
and Zeno, see also Gemelli Marciano 2007, 132&ndash;137). For the
moment, and until a better reconstruction of the treatise becomes
available, its connection to Xenocrates&rsquo; doctrine cannot be
assessed in more detail.</p>

<p>
From Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism of Xenocrates&rsquo; treatment of
geometrical and mathematical items, it also emerges that Xenocrates
sought to account for the generation of geometrical figures (see,
e.g., Arist. <em>Metaph.</em> M6, 1080 b23&ndash;30 = fr. 39 IP; N3,
1090b21&ndash;24; 31&ndash;32 = fr. 38 IP), and that this process was
somehow related to Form-Numbers. The details of how this connection
was conceived, however, remain elusive. Yet, the very need to clarify
the transition from Form-Numbers to geometrical items brings into
focus a point that is consistently emphasized by the early sources:
Xenocrates&rsquo; commitment to the continuity of the system, in
contrast to the fragmented structure of the universe postulated by
Speusippus.</p>

<p>
In <em>Metaphysics</em> Z2, for instance (1028b19&ndash;21 = fr. 23
IP), after introducing the identification of Forms and mathematical
numbers, Aristotle makes a comment about the rest of the universe:</p>

<blockquote>
But some say that the Forms and the numbers have the same nature,
while the others, lines and planes, come next, {and so on} down to the
substance of the heavens and to the perceptibles. (transl. Dancy)
</blockquote>

<p>
It appears that Xenocrates pictured the universe as unfolding in some
sequence from Form-Numbers to geometrical items, and finally to
perceptible things. Compared to that of Speusippus, whose universe
Aristotle portrays as discontinuous or disjointed, Xenocrates&rsquo;
unfolding of the universe from higher principles appears markedly more
continuous. For one thing, Xenocrates renounces the many principles
that Speusippus had introduced for each level of reality, and instead
appeals to just two ultimate principles: the One and the Indefinite
Dyad (see A&euml;tius, I, 7 30 = fr. 133 IP; Plutarch, <em>De an.
procr. in Tim</em>., 1012 d2-f1= fr. 108 IP; Theophrastus,
<em>Metaph.</em> 6b1 = fr. 20 IP). Some scholars have argued that, in
Xenocrates&rsquo; system, the two principles are not entirely equal in
status, and that the Indefinite Dyad is ultimately dependent on or
subordinate to the One, a reading that reinforces the unity and
hierarchical structure of his metaphysics. A prominent version of this
view is offered by Thiel (2006), who, following Kr&auml;mer,
reconstructs Xenocrates&rsquo; thought in light of Plato&rsquo;s
so-called &lsquo;unwritten doctrines&rsquo; and presents him as
formalising these into a tightly integrated metaphysical framework.
Thiel&rsquo;s argument for the subordination of the Dyad relies
chiefly on a passage in Sextus Empiricus (<em>Adv. math</em>. X
&sect;248&ndash;283), which he takes to preserve genuinely Xenocratean
material. The passage is, however, not treated as a genuine report on
Xenocrates in Isnardi Parente&rsquo;s collection, and the early
sources offer no clear support for the view that Xenocrates considered
the Dyad subordinate to the One.</p>

<p>
Further evidence for the continuity and comprehensiveness of
Xenocrates&rsquo; system is preserved by Theophrastus. In his
<em>Metaphysics</em>, Theophrastus complains that Pythagoreans and the
Platonists fail to give us a full story about the construction of the
universe: they just go so far and stop (6a23-b1).</p>

<blockquote>
At present, however, having arrived at a certain [point], many,
certainly, stop completely, as do too those who posit the one and the
indefinite dyad; for having generated numbers and planes and solids,
they leave out almost everything else except to the extent of
apprehending and declaring only this much, that some things are
[generated] from the indefinite dyad [&hellip;] and others from the
numbers and the one [&hellip;]&mdash;but of the heavens and the rest
they make no further mention whatsoever.
</blockquote>

<p>
Then he says (6b6&ndash;10):</p>

<blockquote>
And likewise neither do those around Speusippus nor anyone of the
others except Xenocrates; for he does somehow provide everything about
the universe, alike sensibles, intelligibles, mathematicals, and, what
is more, the divine [things]. (transl. Gutas (2010). For the
commentary, see 311&ndash;312)
</blockquote>

<p>
So, while Aristotle portrays Xenocrates&rsquo; account of the universe
as granting continuity to the universe (in contrast to that of
Speusippus), Theophrastus emphasizes its comprehensiveness: Xenocrates
provides an account that encompasses every level of reality, from
intelligibles to perceptibles (on Xenocrates&rsquo; bridging of
metaphysical entities to perceptibles, see Horky 2022).</p>

<p>
Besides offering a general breakdown of the components of
Xenocrates&rsquo; world (an attempt to reconcile this evidence with
other testimonia can be found in Horky 2013), Theophrastus&rsquo;
mention of &lsquo;divine things&rsquo; is particularly noteworthy. The
claim that these, too, received a specific account and were
accommodated within the system appears to reflect a broader tendency,
already detectable in Plato&rsquo;s later dialogues, and further
developed within the Academy (especially in the <em>Epinomis</em>; see
Aronadio-Tulli-Petrucci 2018 and Calchi 2020), to associate
traditional gods with metaphysical principles and celestial bodies,
thus drawing theology into the domain of metaphysics (for this
tendency in the Academy, see Thiel 2006; Dillon 2020; Bartninkas
2023). A passage in A&euml;tius (A&euml;tius, I, 7 30 = fr. 133 IP,
see Mansfeld-Runia 2020, 400 n. <em>ad</em> &sect;20) seems to reflect
precisely this kind of theological-metaphysical integration. It
reports that Xenocrates identified the One and the Dyad as gods
&mdash; the former male, the latter female&mdash;, regarded the
heavenly bodies as divine, and populated his sublunary world with
<em>daimones</em>. How much of the information preserved in this
testimony can be taken at face value is difficult to determine, as
reconciling its details with what we know of Xenocrates&rsquo;
metaphysics raises several problems (as Dillon 2003 rightly notes,
against the interpretation proposed by Baltes 1988 and largely
accepted by Thiel 2006). Yet, even if the specifics are uncertain,
this and similar passages still testify to the general tendency to
bridge metaphysics and theology.</p>

<p>
We hear more about the gods, <em>daimones</em>, and men from Plutarch,
who tells us (<em>De defectu oraculorum</em> 416c-d = fr. 142 IP) that
Xenocrates associated them with types of triangles: gods with
equilateral ones, <em>daimones</em> with isosceles ones, and men with
scalene triangles. Just as isosceles triangles are intermediate
between equilateral and scalene triangles, so <em>daimones</em> occupy
an intermediate position between gods and men. Another version of this
association between the souls of <em>daimones</em> and triangles is
recorded by Proclus (Procl. <em>In Resp</em>. 2, 48,4ff. Kroll = fr.
143 IP). More generally, Xenocrates appears to have been the first to
develop Plato&rsquo;s scattered references to the
&lsquo;<em>daimonion</em>&rsquo; into a more systematic daemonological
framework (Timotin 2012). On Xenocrates&rsquo; view, daemons can
seemingly be good or evil, but in some testimonia, individual souls
themselves appear to be identified with their daemons, whose moral
stature determines their happiness, as Aristotle records (Arist.
<em>Topics</em> II, 6 112a 32&ndash;37 = fr. 154 IP).</p>

<p>
In addition, there are isolated snatches of other views of Xenocrates
that might fall under the heading &lsquo;metaphysics&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Simplicius, in his commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>
(<em>In Arist. Cat.</em> 63.22&ndash;5 Kalbfleisch = fr. 15 IP) tells
us that Xenocrates objected to Aristotle&rsquo;s list of ten
categories defending that all that was needed was the distinction
&mdash;already outlined by Plato in the (<em>Sophist</em> 255c-d)
&mdash; between things that are &lsquo;by virtue of themselves&rsquo;
and things that are &lsquo;relative to something&rsquo; (Dancy 1999;
Granieri 2021).</p>

<p>
A text preserved in Arabic (Pines 1961; the text is re-printed in
Isnardi Parente&rsquo;s edition as fr. 42) has Alexander of
Aphrodisias criticizing Xenocrates for saying that the species is
prior to the genus on the grounds that, just as parts are prior to
wholes, the genus, being an element in the definition of the species,
is a part of it (the most recent discussion of the material, along
with a translation of the passage, can be found in Rashed 2004).</p>

<p>
A long passage in Themistius&rsquo; <em>Paraphrase of
Aristotle&rsquo;s</em> <em>De anima</em> (= frs. 178&ndash;180 IP, new
critical edition by Garc&iacute;a Valverde 2024) seems to stem from
Xenocrates&rsquo; <em>On Nature</em> (at 11.37&ndash;12.1 Themistius
says &ldquo;It is possible to gather all these {things} from the
<em>On Nature</em> of Xenocrates&rdquo;). This is a discussion of a
story about the composition of the soul from the Form-Numbers 1, 2, 3,
and 4 (although 1 was not normally considered a number), mentioned in
Arist. <em>De anima</em> 408b18&ndash;27. The motivation for this
account of the soul, in both Aristotle and Themistius, is the
explanation of how we can know things about the universe: the universe
derives from those numbers, and so, if the soul is similarly derived,
the soul can know things under the principle that like things are
known by like. It remains uncertain, however, how much of this account
can be securely attributed to Xenocrates.</p>

<h2 id="XenTim">2. Xenocrates and the <em>Timaeus</em></h2>

<p>
A very puzzling definition of the soul is attributed to Xenocrates:
the soul is &ldquo;a self-moving number&rdquo; (see Aristotle, <em>De
Anima</em> I, 2 404b27&ndash;30 = fr. 85 IP. The ascription to
Xenocrates is supported by a substantial number of testimonia
collected by Isnardi Parente as frs. 85&ndash;132 IP). Unfortunately,
the sources tell us little about the philosophical gist of this
definition, which Aristotle says is introduced to account for the
soul&rsquo;s motive and cognitive functions, but which he criticizes
in various occasions (e.g., <em>Topics</em> III, 6 120b 3&ndash;4 =
fr. 87 IP. On Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism of Xenocrates&rsquo;
definition of the soul, see Carter 2019, 103&ndash;122).</p>

<p>
Thanks to Plutarch, however, we have some further insight into
Xenocrates&rsquo; psychology. In the <em>De animae procreatione in
Timaeo</em> we find the following description:</p>

<blockquote>
Since, however, of the men most highly esteemed some were won over by
Xenocrates, who declared the soul&rsquo;s essence to be number itself
being moved by itself, and others adhered to Crantor of Soli, who
makes the soul a mixture of the intelligible nature and of the
opinable nature of perceptible things, I think that the clarification
of these two when exposed will afford us something like a key-note.
The former believes that nothing but the generation of number is
signified by the mixture of the indivisible and divisible being, the
one being indivisible and multiplicity divisible and number being the
product of these when the one bounds multiplicity and inserts a limit
in infinitude, which they call indefinite dyad too [&hellip;]. But
they believe that this number is not yet soul, for it lacks motivity
and mobility but that after the commingling of sameness and
difference, the latter of which is the principle of motion and change
while the former is that of rest, then the product is soul, soul being
a faculty of bringing to a stop and being at rest no less than of
being in motion and setting in motion. (Plut. <em>De an. procr. in
Tim.</em> 1012 d2-f1 = fr. 108IP, transl. Cherniss)
</blockquote>

<p>
Setting aside the issue of the reliability of its sources (the
information is possibly mediated through Eudorus, and thus to be taken
with caution), Plutarch&rsquo;s testimony offers more than a bare
definition: it provides a glimpse into Xenocrates&rsquo; broader
account of the soul. First, we learn that the definition is introduced
in the context of interpreting <em>Timaeus</em> 35a, a key passage for
early Platonists, who frequently used the <em>Timaeus</em>&rsquo;
psychogony to formulate their own views of the soul. Second, Plutarch
presents Xenocrates as conceiving of the Timaean psychogony as a
two-stage process (a pattern followed by ancient Platonists down to
Proclus; see Opsomer 2020). The first stage consists in the generation
of Number, understood as a mixture of the One and the Indefinite Dyad,
here identified with indivisible and divisible being, respectively.
Then, this numerical mixture is combined with Sameness and Difference
identified as principles of motion/change and rest, respectively, so
that Number may acquire the capacities for motion, change, and
permanence that are essential to the soul.</p>

<p>
Many aspects of Xenocrates&rsquo; account remain obscure. Should the
Number mentioned here be identified with Form-Numbers? Why the
emphasis on the soul&rsquo;s capacity for self-motion, a feature not
emphasised (and arguably even denied) in the <em>Timaeus</em> (see
Petrucci 2018, 280&ndash;281 for discussion)? For this reason, some
interpreters (e.g., Sedley 2021) have suggested that the
<em>Phaedrus</em> also forms part of the background. Given
Xenocrates&rsquo; seeming reception of themes developed in
Plato&rsquo;s later dialogues, his pronounced theological interests,
and his tendency to associate cosmic components with divine entities,
it is not implausible to suppose that <em>Laws</em> X also contributes
to the picture.</p>

<p>
Xenocrates is also mentioned in connection with the so-called
&lsquo;metaphorical&rsquo; interpretation of the cosmogony in the
<em>Timaeus</em>, according to which some early Platonists claimed
that Plato&rsquo;s account of the world&rsquo;s
&lsquo;generation&rsquo; was meant as a pedagogical device (Centrone
2010; on the topic, see also Reydams-Schils 2012; Dillon 2012).
According to these Platonists, Plato did not mean to suggest that the
world ever came to be <em>in time</em>: its generation was an
illustrative metaphor, just as geometers make their figures clearer by
showing them in the process of being drawn. The earliest source for
this information is Aristotle (<em>De caelo</em> I 10,
279b32&ndash;280a2 = fr. 73 IP), who refers only to &ldquo;some
people&rdquo;. It is Simplicius who reports that Aristotle had in mind
above all &lsquo;Xenocrates and the Platonists&rsquo; (<em>In
Cael</em>. 303,34&ndash;304,16 = fr. 74 IP) and the same
identification is found in an anonymous scholion, which explicitly
names both Speusippus and Xenocrates as attempting to &lsquo;come to
the rescue&rsquo; of Plato (<em>Scholia in Arist. De Caelo</em>
409a9&ndash;12 Brandis = fr. 76 IP). The <em>De caelo</em> testimony
itself is, however, less explicit than much of the scholarship has
assumed. First, Aristotle consistently attributes to these unnamed
Platonists the claim that the world is &lsquo;indestructible and yet
generated.&rsquo; Second, Aristotle rejects the comparison with
diagrams by appealing to the text of the <em>Timaeus</em>
(<em>Tim.</em> 30a): order, he says, cannot arise from disorder
without a process of generation and therefore without time; by
contrast, in diagrams nothing is separated in time. But why would
Aristotle use a <em>literal</em> reading of the <em>Timaeus</em> to
reject a supposedly <em>metaphorical</em> interpretation? D&ouml;rrie
and Baltes (1998) argue that Aristotle&rsquo;s rejection of the
metaphor is a <em>petitio principii</em>. For further discussion, see
De Cesaris 2023a. It is likely, then, that the later Platonist
tradition played a role in developing the early Platonists&rsquo; view
into a more explicit affirmation of the world&rsquo;s
ungeneratedness.</p>

<h2 id="TheKno">3. Theory of Knowledge</h2>

<p>
As already noted, the theory of knowledge comes under the heading
&lsquo;logic&rsquo; in Sextus Empiricus. No one reports anything for
Xenocrates about what we would think of as &lsquo;pure&rsquo; logic;
Sextus (<em>Adv. math.</em> VII &sect;147&ndash;149 = fr. 2 IP) gives
us a scrap about epistemology. Xenocrates is supposed to have divided
all substances or beings into three groups: perceptible, intelligible,
and believable (also referred to as &lsquo;composite&rsquo; and
&lsquo;mixed&rsquo;). The intelligible ones were objects of knowledge,
which Xenocrates called &lsquo;epistemonic <em>logos</em>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;knowing account&rsquo;, and they were &lsquo;located&rsquo;
outside the heavens. The perceptible ones were objects of perception,
which was a faculty capable of attaining truth but not the same truth
as knowledge; they were within the heavens. The composite ones were
the heavenly bodies themselves, and they were objects of belief, which
is sometimes true and sometimes false.</p>

<p>
This classification of beings likely goes back to Plato&rsquo;s image
of the divided line (<em>Republic</em> VI, 509d-511e), which
Xenocrates appears to have reworked. His tripartite division of
objects recalls the one found in Aristotle, <em>Metaphysics</em>
&Lambda;1.</p>

<p>
The phrase &lsquo;epistemonic logos&rsquo; is one Sextus also assigns
to Speusippus and Democritus (<em>Adv. math.</em> VII &sect;145); it
also recalls discussions in Aristotle (e.g. Arist. <em>Metaph.</em>
Z15) and the end of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Theaetetus</em>. While it is
difficult to pin down what precisely Xenocrates meant by this, an
&lsquo;epistemonic <em>logos</em>&rsquo; seems to correspond to an
account that is constitutive of, or equivalent to, knowledge.</p>

<p>
The intelligible domain must have included the Form-Numbers dealt with
above, which was also, as mentioned, the domain of mathematics, while
the special place accorded to the heavens seems to explain
Xenocrates&rsquo; interest for astronomy, as witnessed by the fact
that one of the items in D.L.&rsquo;s bibliography is &lsquo;<em>On
Astronomy</em>, 6 books&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
As to the sensible domain, an important testimony preserved in
Porphyry (<em>In Ptol. Harm</em>. 31,1&ndash;6 = fr. 6 IP; for a
defense of the authenticity of the content, see Alieva 2018) offers
valuable insight into Xenocrates&rsquo; account of sense perception,
particularly hearing. The passage is introduced as Xenocrates&rsquo;
report of how Pythagoras discovered that musical intervals are
grounded in numerical ratios, and it includes a detailed account of
the mechanics of hearing. Sound (<em>ph&#333;n&#275;</em>), it is
said, originates with an impact and travels in a straight line towards
the sense organ, which it sets in motion, thereby producing
perception. This impact occurs in an instant, which is imperceptible
to the senses due to their weakness. To illustrate this, Xenocrates
draws on a visual analogy: when a spinning cone bears a
single-coloured point or line, it appears as a continuous surface of
colour. Likewise, the ear, unable to register the intervals of silence
between discrete impacts, forms an impression (<em>phantasia</em>) of
continuous sound (Alieva 2018). Hearing, Xenocrates adds, is
&lsquo;more disturbed&rsquo; than vision, but the explanatory model
appears to be shared across modalities. Notably, despite their
imprecision, the senses are not considered unreliable: although they
cannot grasp &lsquo;what is exact&rsquo; (<em>to akrib&#275;s</em>)
&mdash; that is, they fail to apprehend their objects with full
precision &mdash;, they are nonetheless able to convey some degree of
truth. As Raffa (2016, 727) has emphasized, Xenocrates presents the
senses as reliably reporting perceptible distinctions such as pitch,
colour, or form. Moreover, our perceptual faculties are said to
naturally recoil from stimuli that are disordered (such as unpleasant
smells or anti-melodic sounds), while they respond favourably to those
structured by numerical proportion. Xenocrates&rsquo; account thus
acknowledges both the limitations and the cognitive value of the
senses, embedding them within what appears to be a unified explanatory
framework in which perception, though incapable of yielding knowledge,
offers epistemically meaningful access to reality. In this context,
music and sound are not exceptions but serve as paradigmatic
illustrations of the dynamic interplay between sensory input and
intelligible structure.</p>

<h2 id="Eth">4. Ethics</h2>

<p>
Here we are very much in the dark: what we have are mostly
disconnected snippets.</p>

<p>
Aristotle names Xenocrates twice in the <em>Topics.</em> First, at II
6. 112a37&ndash;38 (= fr. 154 IP), he ascribes to Xenocrates the view
that a happy man is one with a good soul, along with the claim that
one&rsquo;s soul is one&rsquo;s <em>daimon.</em> Then, at VII 1.
152a7&ndash;9 (= fr. 158 IP) he attributes to him an argument
according to which the good life and the happy life are the same, for
both are the most choiceworthy.</p>

<p>
A clearer, albeit much later, report comes from Clement of Alexandria,
who ascribes to Xenocrates the view that happiness consists in the
possession of the appropriate virtue and the power necessary to act in
accordance with it. Clement continues:</p>

<blockquote>
Then, as if he wants to say where it resides, he clearly indicates the
soul. For the originating causes, he points to the virtues; for its
component parts he points to noble actions, and states, dispositions,
motions and attitudes of high morality; for its necessary concomitants
he points to physical and external circumstances. (Clement, <em>Strom.
ii</em> 133 5 = fr. 150 IP, transl. Ferguson)
</blockquote>

<p>
The passage, remarkably rich for a doxographical source, suggests that
Xenocrates defined happiness as a structured whole that encompasses
not only the stable possession of virtue, but also a practical
capacity to enact it. Notably, the internal conditions (states,
dispositions, actions) are given priority, while physical and external
goods are included as necessary conditions but not constitutive parts
(more on the testimony can be found in De Cesaris 2023b).</p>

<p>
Plutarch (<em>De communibus notitiis</em> 1069e-f = fr. 151 IP)
attributes to Xenocrates the idea that happiness consists in living
according to nature. Other reports convey related ideas, such as
Xenocrates&rsquo; description of philosophical life as the
&ldquo;cessation of disturbance&rdquo; ([Galen], <em>Hist. phil</em>.
8 = fr. 171 IP), a formulation that foreshadows Hellenistic ideals of
tranquillity (<em>ataraxia</em>), though this is not made central in
any extant account. These views, if genuine, seems to aim to the same
sorts of goals that were typical of later Hellenistic schools.</p>

<p>
Although there is no reason to be overly sceptical about possible
lines of continuity (after all, Xenocrates&rsquo; scolarchate is
marked by the transition into the Hellenistic period) our ability to
assess the relationship between his ethics and later doctrines remains
limited. Much of the evidence comes from later sources, particularly
Cicero and Clement, and may reflect Antiochus of Ascalon&rsquo;s
project of harmonising Academic and Stoic doctrines. As a result,
while there are suggestive overlaps, it remains difficult to determine
how far Xenocrates&rsquo; ethics genuinely prefigure Hellenistic
concerns, and how much is the product of later reinterpretation within
a reconciliatory agenda.</p>
