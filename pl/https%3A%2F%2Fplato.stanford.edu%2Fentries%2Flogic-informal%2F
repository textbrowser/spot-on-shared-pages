<h1>Informal Logic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Nov 25, 1996; substantive revision Wed Jan 28, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Informal logic (&ldquo;IL&rdquo;) is the study of reasoning and
inference as they occur in public discussion and debate, educational
and intellectual pursuits, interpersonal exchanges, and law, medicine
and other &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; contexts. IL understands the aim of
argument to be the &ldquo;epistemic betterment&rdquo; that accompanies
belief, understanding, and claims to knowledge that are made more
credible by argument. Different informal logics support this aim by
providing varying (sometimes competing) accounts of argument,
evidence, proof, and justification. The development of these accounts
is grounded in an instrumental outlook that emphasizes their
usefulness in the evaluation of everyday arguments.</p>

<p>
Blair 2015 identifies two key methodological tasks for informal logic:
(i) the development of ways to identify (and &ldquo;extract&rdquo;)
ordinary arguments from the real life exchanges in which they occur;
and (ii) the development of methods and tools that can be used to
assess their strength and cogency.</p>

<p>
Contributions to IL logic include many studies of specific kinds of
arguing. The overriding goal is a normative framework that can be
applied to ordinary arguments. In pursuit of this goal, IL addresses
topics which include: the nature and definition of arguing, argument,
and argumentation; criteria for argument evaluation; argumentation
schemes; fallacies; notions of validity; the ethics of arguing; the
argumentative use of definitions (Hitchcock 2021); argument
diagramming (&ldquo;mapping&rdquo;); cognitive biases; the history of
logic and argument analysis; artificial intelligence (AI); feminist
accounts of argument; the extent to which arguing as a practice is
inherently collaborative or adversarial (see Stevens and Cohen 2019,
Battersby and Bailin 2021; and Govier 2021); and the different norms
associated with arguing in different kinds of contexts.</p>

<p>
 <a href="http://windsor.scholarsportal.info/omp/index.php/wsia/catalog/book/123" target="other">Puppo 2019</a>
 provides a series of articles that discuss the roots and the nature
of informal logic, and many of the key issues it addresses.</p>

<h2><a id="His">1. History</a></h2>

<p>
The term &ldquo;informal logic&rdquo; was popularized in the 1970s,
most notably by Johnson and Blair, who established the <em>Informal
Logic Newsletter</em> and then the journal <em>Informal Logic</em>.
The roots of informal logic are much older, making it a sophisticated
version of historical attempts to create and disseminate a logic that
can be used to explain, systematize, assess, and teach the use of
argument for practical purposes.</p>

<p>
The roots of informal logic as it is now understood are tied to the
history of Western Philosophy, though it is increasingly evident that
other philosophical traditions have much to contribute to the study of
the issues that are the focus of IL. Five prominent traditions from
the past: ancient Greek, classical Indian, classical Chinese, medieval
Latin, and medieval Islamicate philosophy are discussed in the
&ldquo;historical supplement&rdquo; to the article on
 <a href="../argument/">argument and argumentation</a>
 in this encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
In the 5th century B.C.E., the First Sophistic is a relevant movement
motivated by the notion that one can teach the art of <em>logos</em>
in a way that can be effectively employed in public argument and
debate (see Tindale 2010). In the century that follows,
Aristotle&rsquo;s logical and rhetorical works &mdash; most notably
the <em>Prior Analytics</em> and the <em>Rhetoric</em> &mdash; provide
a systematic account of logic and argument which can be applied to an
impressively broad range of real-life arguments. Groarke (2021)
suggests that Aristotle is the &ldquo;forefather&rdquo; of
today&rsquo;s informal logic.</p>

<p>
In modern times, <em>The Port Royal Logic</em> (Arnauld and Nicole
1662, originally titled <em>Logic or the Art of Thinking</em>) is an
attempt to outline a logic that can guide everyday reasoning. It is a
celebrated (but also disdained) introduction to the art of arguing
that has been published in more than fifty French editions and five
popular English translations. It understands &ldquo;logic&rdquo; to be
&ldquo;the art of directing reason aright, in obtaining the knowledge
of things, for the instruction both of ourselves and others&rdquo;
(25). It provides a practical account of good and poor argument,
discussing fallacies, syllogisms, definitions, and deductive and
probable reasoning, emphasizing real rather than concocted examples of
argument (for a good account of it that highlights its relevance to
informal logic, see Finocchiaro 1997).</p>

<p>
One finds other analogues of contemporary attempts to study and teach
informal reasoning in nineteenth century textbooks on logic and on
rhetoric. Richard Whately&rsquo;s work is of special note in this regard.
His began his educational career as professor of political economy at
Oxford; was subsequently appointed the Archbishop of Dublin; and
attempted to establish a non-sectarian system of education in Ireland.
In support of the latter, he published texts on reasoning. In many
ways, his
 <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015063020500&amp;view;=image&amp;seq;=" target="other"><em>Elements of Logic</em></a>
 and <em>Elements of Rhetoric</em> (1826, 1830) are early analogues of
today&rsquo;s informal logic textbooks.</p>

<p>
Another important nineteenth century text, critical of Whately, but
also published to promote good arguing in real-life contexts, is
Mill&rsquo;s <em>A System of Logic </em> (1882) (see Godden 2014).
According to Mill&rsquo;s account, logic is the &ldquo;art and science of
reasoning,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to reason is simply to infer any
assertion from assertions already admitted.&rdquo; The end result is a
broad account of inference designed to inform real-life instances of
argument.</p>

<p>
The term &ldquo;informal logic&rdquo; first occurs in the last chapter
of Gilbert Ryle&rsquo;s book <em>Dilemmas</em> (1954). It suggests
that philosophy needs an informal logic to address arguments that are
more varied, less strict, and less clearly defined than those that can
be analyzed by applying formal logic.</p>

<p>
In North America, the rise of informal logic is tied to a similar
dissatisfaction with logic&rsquo;s then prevalent focus on the &lsquo;formal&rsquo;
aspects of argumentation. It reflected aspirations to mathematize&rsquo;
logic in a context strongly influenced by the study of mathematical
logic in the work of Frege, Russell, Hilbert etc.</p>

<p>
The informal turn was tied to educational trends of the 1960s &mdash;
a time of social upheaval and protest (most notably, against the War
in Vietnam). In universities and colleges, this fueled calls for
courses that were more relevant to the issues of the day. In the case
of logic, some pushed for an emphasis on the study of real-life
arguing that expanded the discussions in the introductory textbooks of
the day &ndash; books like Copi&rsquo;s popular <em>Introduction to
Logic</em> (first published in 1953 and still in use in later variants
that have extended its account of informal arguments).</p>

<p>
In <em>Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday
Life</em> (1971), Kahane fully embraces real life arguing, discussing
a wide range of arguments from newspapers, mass media, advertisements,
books, and political campaigns. Other attempts to provide a general
introduction to logic &mdash; by Carney and Scheer (1964), Munson
(1976), and Fogelin (1978) &mdash; used the term &ldquo;informal
logic&rdquo; to distinguish between formal logic and other methods of
argument analysis.</p>

<p>
The idea that informal logic should be developed as a distinct field
of inquiry was championed by Johnson and Blair at the University of
Windsor. They published a popular textbook, <em>Logical
Self-Defense</em> (1977); organized, hosted, and published the
proceedings of &ldquo;The First International Symposium on Informal
Logic&rdquo; (Blair and Johnson, 1980); established the <em>Informal
Logic Newsletter</em> (1978&ndash;1983); and ultimately turned the latter
into the journal <em>Informal Logic</em> (subtitled &ldquo;Reasoning
and Argumentation in Theory and Practice&rdquo;). In this and other
ways, they established informal logic as a distinct field for study,
research and development. Their contributions (and those of colleagues
at Windsor, in Ontario, and in Canada) is reflected in suggestions
that informal logic is a Canadian (or, more narrowly, Windsor) school
of argument (see Puppo 2019).</p>

<p>
The discussion that has shaped IL as a field of inquiry has included
articles in a number of other journals that have played a major role
in its development. They include <em>Argumentation</em>,
<em>Philosophy and Rhetoric</em>, <em>Argumentation and Advocacy</em>
(formerly the <em>Journal of the American Forensic Association</em>),
<em>Teaching Philosophy</em>, <em>Cogency</em> and (more recently)
<em>Argument and Computation</em>.</p>

<p>
A key catalyst that continues to promote the development of informal
logic is the Critical Thinking Movement (&ldquo;CT&rdquo;) within
education (see Ennis 2011 and Blair 2021). It aims to make the
critical scrutiny of our beliefs and assumptions a fundamental goal of
education at all levels, underscoring the significance of reasoning,
inference, argument and critical assessment skills.</p>

<p>
In 1980, a California State University Executive Order promoted the
teaching of critical thinking and informal logic, requiring formal
instruction in critical thinking in post secondary institutions.
According to the order: &ldquo;Instruction in critical thinking is to
be designed to achieve an understanding of the relationship of
language to logic, which should lead to the ability to analyze,
criticize, and advocate ideas, to reason inductively and deductively
and to reach factual or judgmental conclusions based on sound
inferences drawn from unambiguous statements of knowledge or
belief&rdquo; (Dumke 1980, Executive Order 338).</p>

<p>
The accounts of argument that informal logic and the Critical Thinking
movement emphasize are widely used in attempts to teach students and
learners how to reason well (and are a staple in the &ldquo;Philosophy for
Children&rdquo; movement). One result has been hundreds (perhaps thousands)
of introductory textbooks used to teach logic, critical thinking, and
argumentation skills to university and college students in Canada, the
United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Chile, and other
countries.</p>

<p>
The educational issues raised by informal logic are manifest in the
development of critical thinking tests which attempt to measure
argumentation skills. Critical thinking (or, even more so, creative
thinking) skills are not easily assessed using standardized tests
which are designed for large scale use, and typically rely on multiple
choice question and answers (see Sobocan 2021).</p>

<p>
In real life contexts, what counts as good arguing (and thinking) is
open ended and unpredictable, dialectical, and influenced by pragmatic
and contextual considerations which are difficult to incorporate
within standardized tests. The California Critical Thinking Test
reflects the view of critical thinking elaborated in &ldquo;The Delphi
Report,&rdquo; commissioned by the American Philosophical Association
in 1987, a report that focuses on a narrow range of critical thinking
skills which tends to oversimplify the competencies required for good
informal argument. Ennis 2013 provides a comprehensive proposal for
dealing with the issues raised by critical thinking tests, and with
other challenges raised by attempts to teach critical thinking.</p>

<p>
IL textbooks (in English) offer a number of theoretical and
pedagogical innovations. Established texts include Battersby 2016
(<em>Is That a Fact? A Field Guide for Evaluating Statistical and
Scientific Information</em>, 2nd ed.); Bowell, Cowan, Kemp 2019
(<em>Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide</em>, 5th ed.); Browne and
Keeley 2018 (<em>Asking the Right Questions</em>, 12th ed.); Govier
2019 (<em>A Practical Study of Argument</em>, 7th ed.); Groarke,
Tindale and Carozza 2025 (<em>Good Reasoning Matters!</em>, 6th ed.);
Hughes, Lavery and Doran 2014 (<em>Critical Thinking: An Introduction
to the Basic Skills</em>, 7th ed.); Seay and Nuccetelli 2012 (<em>How
to Think Logically</em>, 2nd ed.); Weston 2018 (<em>A Rulebook for
Arguments</em>, 5th ed.); and Wilson 2020 (<em>A Guide to Good
Reasoning: Cultivating Intellectual Virtues</em>, 2nd ed.).</p>

<p>
In Poland, Ajdukiewicz&rsquo;s <em>Pragmatic Logic</em> (1974) is an
introductory account of an independently developed &ldquo;pragmatic
logic&rdquo; which is comparable to informal logic, promoting tools of
logic as a central element of general education. It aims to ensure
that students think clearly and consistently, express their thoughts
and ideas systematically and precisely, and justify their claims with
proper inferences (see Koszowy 2010).</p>

<p>
In part because reasoning and argument are ubiquitous and of broad
interest, the evolution of informal logic has been influenced by
cognate fields which analyze argumentation in some way. The latter
include formal logic, speech communication, rhetoric, linguistics,
Artificial Intelligence (AI), discourse analysis, feminism, semiotics,
cognitive psychology, and computational modelling. Considered in this
broader context, informal logic is a subfield of a broader
multi-disciplinary attempt to develop a comprehensive account of real
life arguing (commonly called &ldquo;argumentation theory&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
The development of informal logic and argumentation theory have been
spurred by numerous international conferences hosted by organizations
committed to the study of argument. Key conferences include ten
Amsterdam conferences hosted by the International Society for the
Study of Argumentation (ISSA); thirteen Windsor conferences hosted by
the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA); six Tokyo
Conferences on Argumentation hosted by the Japanese Debate Association
(JDA); five meetings of the European Conference on Argumentation
(ECA); ten meetings of the International Conference on Computational
Models of Argument (hosted by COMMA), and numerous events and
workshops on issues ofa rgumentation, dialogue, and persuasion
organized by the Polish group ARGDIAP.</p>

<p>
One of the early driving forces behind the development of informal
logic as a discipline was a desire for a logic that contained tools
for argument analysis and assessment above and beyond the standard
formal logics of the day (propositional logic, truth tables,
syllogisms, the predicate calculus, modal logic, etc.). In his account
of the rise of informal logic, Johnson emphasizes a
&ldquo;dissatisfaction with formal logic as the vehicle for teaching
skill in argument evaluation and argument formation&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;desire to provide a complete theory of reasoning that goes
beyond formal deductive and inductive logic&rdquo; (2014, p. 11). Ryle
never developed a system of &ldquo;informal logic,&rdquo; but his
remarks on the need for one point in the same direction.</p>

<p>
Philosophers and logicians who teach introductory courses on argument
and critical thinking have managed the issues this raises in a number
of ways. In many cases, by mixing formal and informal methods of
analysis. The artificial examples of argument that characterize early
editions of Copi have been roundly criticized (see Johnson 1996 and
Blair 2015), but other early textbook authors more successfully melded
classical logic and real instances of argument. Harrison 1969 is an
example; as are texts by Pospesel, who firmly anchors his discussion
in real-life cases of reasoning (Pospesel and Marans 1978; Rodes and
Pospesel 1991; and Pospesel 2002). Little 1980 developed a general
approach to critical thinking and decision making that integrated
propositional and syllogistic reasoning. The most recent editions of
Copi&rsquo;s famous text are now notable for the extent to which they
emphasize real-life arguments (see Copi et. al. 2019).</p>

<p>
Some informal logicians have responded to the formal/informal divide
by moving in the opposite direction, developing versions of informal
logic that do not utilize formal tools, borrowing alternative accounts
of argument from philosophical reflection or other fields that study
argument (notably, rhetoric, dialectics, and speech communication).
Toulmin&rsquo;s <em>The Uses of Argument</em> (1958/2003) and
Hamblin&rsquo;s <em>Fallacies</em> (1970) have become theoretical
touchstones for those looking to root informal logic rooted outside of
classical formal logic.</p>

<p>
In a number of ways, variants of informal logic share some
foundational notions with their formal cousins. Most significantly,
both formal and informal logic share:</p>

<ul>

<li>a premise, inference, and conclusion conception of argument;</li>

<li>the notion that a good argument has premises which are true (or
epistemically acceptable in some way) and a conclusion which follows
from them (making the inference the argument depends on
&ldquo;valid&rdquo; in some way); and</li>

<li>tools of argument assessment that recognize many arguments as
instances of more generalized &ldquo;schemes of argument&rdquo; (which
include standard deductive patterns of reasoning).</li>
</ul>

<p>
IL is informal rather than formal in two ways. First, because it
focuses on arguments as they occur in natural language discourse
rather than formal languages of the sort that characterize formal
logic. The latter are notable for rigorously defined syntax,
semantics, and grammar, and argumentation governed by precise proof
procedures. In contrast, the arguments informal logic studies are
notable for their use of everyday language; for the many complex norms
that govern them in different contexts; and for diverse ways of making
meaning (with pictures, facial expressions, non-verbal sounds, music,
etc.) that they constantly employ. Today, the advent of AI is bridging
the gap between these two kinds of language by creating formal models
of argument that can more fully capture, replicate, and present
arguing in ways that mimic natural language discourse.</p>

<p>
IL is informal rather than formal in a second way in its theoretical
and pedagogical discussions. In a way that is in keeping with the
social and pedagogical goals that motivate its development, they tend
toward an easily understood, broadly disseminated, account of the
difference between strong and weak instances of real life reasoning
that can be understood by everyday arguers. Formal methods (Venn
diagrams; probability theory &mdash; see Zenker 2013; different kinds
of formal logic; etc.) may be usefully invoked in support of this
ideal, but the overriding aim is doing so in ways that can be readily
employed by ordinary arguers.</p>

<p>
Within argumentation theory, informal logic is tied to studies of
particular aspects of arguing (e.g., onus, burden of proof, or the
norms that govern arguments in specific contexts); the analysis of
arguments from historical, social, political or feminist points of
view; the study of particular kinds of argument (e.g., those expressed
in political works of art, those that arise in specific legal
contexts); and the discussion of the assumptions, conditions
(philosophical, epistemological, social, political, institutional,
psychological, educational, etc.) which give rise to disagreement and
argumentation in the first place.</p>

<p>
Theoretically, argumentation theory unites three approaches to
argument that have been associated with logic, rhetoric, and
dialectics since ancient times. Logic treats an argument as an attempt
to justify a conclusion, focusing on its epistemic merit. Rhetoric
understands arguing as an attempt to persuade an audience, emphasizing
its persuasive force. Dialectics understands an argument as an attempt
to make a move in an exchange between interlocutors with opposing
points of view, tying it to an interaction between argumentative
opponents who argue back and forth.</p>

<p>
Though informal logic emphasizes the epistemic merit of an argument,
its development has been influenced by rhetorical and dialectical
considerations, in view of the role that arguments play in public
discussion and debate. For successful public arguments must convince
some intended audience (the public, ornithologists, Members of
Parliament, the readers of a particular magazine, etc.) of a point of
view and convincing arguments must (as Johnson 2000 emphasizes)
provide answers to reasonable objections made by interlocutors who
have opposing points of view. Bermejo Luque 2011 proposes a relevant
theory of argument which aims to accommodate logical, rhetorical and
dialectical points of view.</p>

<p>
A comprehensive series of essays that introduce to the issues that
matter to informal logic and argumentation theory can be found in
Aikin, Casey and Stevens, 2025 (and the Bondy 2025 contribution to
that anthology).</p>

<h2><a id="Arg">2. Systems of IL</a></h2>

<p>
As Hansen (2012) emphasizes, there are many different tools and
methods informal logicians use to analyze and assess instances of
argument. It would be a mistake to write as though there was
<em>one</em> informal logic. As a field, IL is characterized by a
shared goal (a logic of everyday argument) that is pursued in many
different ways by commentators who propose and apply different systems
of informal logic. In view of this, there are many different informal
logic<em><b>s</b></em> (as there are many different formal
logics).</p>

<p>
I will take an informal logic <em>system</em> to be a collection of
principles and methods designed to serve the (epistemic) assessment of
real-life arguments. Considered from this point of view, informal
logic is a field devoted to the creation, study and application of
systems of informal logic.</p>

<p>
The first textbook that describes itself as an informal logic text is
Munson&rsquo;s <em>The Way of Words: An Informal Logic</em> (1976). As
the title emphasizes, it aims to teach a system of informal logic that
can be used to analyze and assess real-life arguments. Other
approaches that imply other systems of informal logic are developed in
other textbooks and in scholarly discussion.</p>

<p>
Different informal logics vary in ways outlined in this article.</p>

<h3>2.1 Defining &ldquo;Argument&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
The most basic notion in a system of IL is a concept of argument. In
ordinary language, the word &ldquo;argue&rdquo; may mean &ldquo;to
disagree,&rdquo; often with the implication that someone does so
aggressively and with acrimony. Informal logic assumes a narrower
conception of argument (sometimes called &ldquo;argument-1&rdquo;),
understanding an argument as an attempt to resolve disagreement (or
potential disagreement) by providing <em>reasons</em> in support of
some point of view.</p>

<p>
This notion of argument is &ldquo;evidentiary&rdquo; in the sense that
it understands an argument as an attempt to provide evidence in favor
of some conclusion. The <em>premises</em> in an argument convey the
evidence it provides. As Hitchcock 2007 puts it, an argument is
&ldquo;a claim-reason complex&rdquo; consisting of (1) premises, (2) a
conclusion, and (3) an inference from the premises to the conclusion
(establishing it as true, likely true, plausible, acceptable, or in
some other way probative).</p>

<p>
The following sentence, taken from an article in the <em>Houston
Chronicle</em> (Devra Gartenstein 28/01/19) is an argument in this
sense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE 1: Small businesses are important because they provide
opportunities for entrepreneurs and create meaningful jobs with
greater job satisfaction than positions with larger, traditional
companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this example, the word &ldquo;because&rdquo; functions as an
inference indicator, telling us that the initial statement in the
sentence (&ldquo;Small businesses are important&rdquo;) is a
conclusion backed by a premise (that small businesses &ldquo;provide
opportunities for entrepreneurs and create meaningful jobs with
greater job satisfaction than positions with larger, traditional
companies&rdquo;) providing reasons for believing that it is true.</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE 2 is taken from an opinion piece (in the <em>Western
Courier</em> 25/10/08) which criticizes conservative groups opposed to
research using human embryos.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 2: This [opposition to embryonic research] is shortsighted and
stubborn. The fact is, fetuses are being aborted whether conservatives
like it or not. Post-abortion, the embryos are literally being thrown
away when they could be used in lifesaving medical research.... Lives
could be saved and vastly improved if only scientists were allowed to
use embryos that are otherwise being tossed in the garbage.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is an argument that can be summarized as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Premise</em>: Fetuses are being aborted anyway (whether
conservatives like it or not).
<br />
<em>Premise</em>: Lives could be saved and vastly improved if
scientists were allowed to use embryos that are otherwise being tossed
in the garbage.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: The conservative opposition to embryonic research
is shortsighted and stubborn.
</blockquote>

<p>
Like EXAMPLE 1, this is a simple argument. In real life arguing,
complex arguments may contain tens (or hundreds) of premises, and
usually consist of layers of inference that proceed from initial
premises to intermediate conclusions which are premises for further
conclusions, culminating in some &ldquo;main&rdquo; or
&ldquo;principal&rdquo; conclusion.</p>

<p>
All systems of IL are attempts to understand and assess arguments in
the premise/conclusion sense, but there are many variations of this
basic concept. Sometimes it is expanded by defining an argument as a
premise-conclusion complex which is directed at an <em>audience</em>,
or backed by a <em>warrant</em>, or provided as an answer to a
questioning <em>opponent</em>. Moves in these directions make an
audience, warrant, and/or dialectical context an essential part of
argument.</p>

<h3>2.2 Theories of Argument</h3>

<p>
Different theoretical backgrounds often inform different systems of
informal logic. The theoretical grounding for a particular IL may be
located in a philosophical point of view, a theory of speech
communication, or new or novel ways of evaluating real-life arguments
(in Aristotle, in feminism, in rhetoric, in dialogue theory, in
cognitive psychology, in formal logic, or in some combination of these
and/or other points of view).</p>

<p>
Theoretical underpinnings may demarcate a specific system of IL or,
more commonly, a family of systems that share core theoretical
commitments. Following Hamblin, some informal logicians have, to take
one example, embraced fallacy theory as a way to build a logic of
real-life arguing. In doing so they build systems of informal logic
(as in the case of Paul and Elder 2019, or Bennett 2018) but are at
the same time, members of a broader family of informal logics that
adopt the fallacy approach (but vary their definitions and lists of
fallacies, or their accounts of other aspects of argument
analysis).</p>

<h3>2.3 The Language of Argument (<b>NL</b> and <b>NL+</b>)</h3>

<p>
A key element of informal logic is its focus on arguments as they
occur within natural rather than formal languages.</p>

<p>
Initially, most informal logic textbooks focused their attention on
printed verbal arguments: arguments expressed and conveyed in printed
words (in some established natural language). This emphasis reflects
both the nature of these texts (qua books in print) and the extent to
which arguments of this sort are the clearest example of the kinds of
argument informal logic emphasizes &mdash; in letters to the editor;
in parliamentary debate; in court proceedings; and in essays and books
written in defense of some point of view (that humans could colonize
Mars, that President Trump was mistaken, that socialism is the best
political system, and so on).</p>

<p>
When a system of informal logic is designed to analyze and assess
verbal arguments of this sort, the language of argument they assume
consists of the printed words and sentences (and the rules governing
them) associated with the corresponding natural language
(&ldquo;NL&rdquo;). This implies a complex and nuanced system of
meaning that expands the possibilities of argument beyond the
&ldquo;informative&rdquo; statements of fact that authors like Copi
took to be the (only) legitimate realm of argument. One feature of
this expanded realm is the extent to which metaphors and other figures
of speech (traditionally understood as rhetorical figures) are used to
support conclusions &mdash; something that must in some way be
accounted for in a comprehensive account of real-life reasoning.</p>

<p>
As informal logic has evolved, systems of IL have expanded to make
room for real-life arguments which are not wholly defined by printed
words. Oral arguments are verbal, but their meanings often depend on
non-verbal elements like tone of voice and an arguer&rsquo;s facial
expressions. &ldquo;Visual&rdquo; arguments invoke photographs,
illustrations, drawings, videos, etc. that provide evidence in support
of some conclusion&ndash;as when a photograph or video is used to
establish someone&rsquo;s identity or show (and thereby
&ldquo;prove&rdquo;) that they were present at the scene of a crime.
As Hitchcock (2002) notes, &ldquo;a poster with a giant photograph of
a starving emaciated child and the words &lsquo;make poverty
history&rsquo; can reasonably be construed as an argument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In most cases, they have verbal as well as visual elements and are, in
view of this, an amalgam of verbal and non-verbal (visual) elements.
The two photographs in EXAMPLE 3 (below), taken by the NASA Mars rover
Phoenix, were key components of a visual argument proposed by NASA
scientists. The first provides an initial view of a dig made by
Phoenix; the second a view of the same dig four Martian days (sols)
later. When one visually examines at the bottom left hand corners of
the photographs, one sees white crust in the first but not the second
image. According to the NASA scientists, the only way to plausibly
explain the difference one sees is by understanding the crust as water
ice that evaporated when the dig exposed it to the sun. In this way,
the photographs provide evidence that there is water on the planet
Mars.</p>
<br />

<div class="figure">
<img src="mars2.jpg" alt="nasa rover" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">EXAMPLE 3</span></p>
</div>

<p>
We can summarize the argument as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 3:
<br />
<em>(Visual) Premise</em>: What we see in the bottom left hand corner
of the first photograph of the dig.
<br />
<em>(Visual) Premise</em>: What we see in the bottom left hand corner
of the second photograph of the dig.
<br />
<em>(Verbal) Premise</em>: The most plausible way to explain the
changes we see (the disappearance of the white crust) is by
understanding it as water ice.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: There is water on the planet Mars.
</blockquote>

<p>
This argument depends on visual and verbal premises. Visual premises
because our <em>seeing</em> of the difference between the photographs
is a non-verbal way of providing evidence that supports the
conclusion. The argument combines this visual element with a key
verbal component provided by the scientists&rsquo; explanation of this
seeing. The conclusion is established by combining these visual and
verbal components.</p>

<p>
When a system of IL recognizes visual arguments of this sort, the
language it assumes can be understood as NL+, where the + sign
indicates that the language of argument includes words <em>and</em>
non-verbal elements like images and non-verbal sounds.</p>

<p>
One might compare the expansion of IL&rsquo;s scope to account for visual
arguments to the attempt to expand the language of formal logic (and,
some argue, the notion of argument it embraces) to allow visual
deductions (see Barwise and Etchemendy 1998). Visual premises are
often used in geometric proofs, in legal arguments (to prove that the
murder was heinous, etc.), in reasoning about geology, biology,
planets, stars and black holes, and in aesthetic criticism and
evaluation. In ornithology, a well authenticated, clear photograph of
a species like the Ivory Billed Woodpecker is widely accepted as the
proper proof that it is not extinct.</p>

<p>
In other cases, a visual image may serve as a conclusion which is
backed by visual and/or verbal premises. A forensic artist concludes
that their drawing of a suspect depicts what they look like by
inferring this from verbal and visual evidence which is provided by
the witnesses they interview.</p>

<p>
 <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10503-015-9348-4/fulltext.html" target="other">Kjeldsen 2015</a>
 has provided a comprehensive overview of the early study of visual
arguments (for more recent discussions, see Dove 2025, Liao 2025, and
Groarke 2025b). Informal logics that recognize visual arguments do so
for the same reason that they recognize verbal arguments: to account
for the kinds of arging that occur in real- life discourse and
exchange. The use of images in arguments is increasingly significant
at a time when advances in digital communication facilitate the
creation and distribution of visual images, increasing the use of
photographs, videos, art, political cartoons, virtual reality, 3D
modeling and other kinds of images in arguments (see Godden,
Palczewski, and Groarke, 2016).</p>

<p>
As is the case with words, the images used in visual arguments may not
be literal depictions of something they represent, but function
instead as visual metaphors which characterize some situation in an
argumentatively charged way.</p>

<p>
The cartoon of Napoleon III below (EXAMPLE 4) appeared in
<em>Punch</em> on Feb. 19, 1859.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="FrenchPorcupineSE.jpg" alt="Political cartoon of a porcupine with the face, hands, and boots of a man. The porcupine/man is saying, &lsquo;L&rsquo;Empire c&rsquo;est la paix&rsquo;. The caption reads, &lsquo;The French Porcupine: He may be an Inoffensive Animal, but he Don't Look like it&rsquo;."/>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">EXAMPLE 4</span></p>
</div>

<p>
This is a clever caricature, something more than a simple caricature,
for the cartoonist uses a drawing of Napoleon-as-porcupine to convey a
<em>reason</em> to doubt his profession of peace. We might summarize
the point as the suggestion that Napoleon&rsquo;s actions&ndash; his
amassing of the armaments which encircle him like quills on a
porcupine&ndash;are not the actions of someone committed to peace. The
picture invites the viewer to respond to him as one would respond to
an actual porcupine&ndash;with caution, concern and suspicion, wary of
what he might do with his weapons (even though he has an
&ldquo;inoffensive&rdquo; posture and professes peace).</p>

<p>
The argument we can extract from the cartoon can be understood as
follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Premise</em>: Napoleon declares that &ldquo;The Empire embodies
peace&rdquo; (&ldquo;L&rsquo;Empire c&rsquo;est la paix&rdquo;).
<br />
<em>Premise</em>: Napoleon has surrounded himself with many armaments
(like a porcupine surrounds itself with quills).
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: Napoleon seems inoffensive when he says that
&ldquo;The Empire embodies peace,&rdquo; but his build up of him
armaments shows that we should be wary of the empire he has built.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a visual argument because it depends on visual meanings
(conveyed with an NL+ rather than a mere NL). The verbal paraphrase
summarizes the apparent logic of the argument, though the non-verbal
visual elements leave open the possibility of further interpretation.
Notably, the Napoleon-III-as-porcupine caricature may be an allusion
to a different &ldquo;Louis&rdquo; King of France&ndash;to Louis XII,
who ruled from 1498 to 1515. On this interpretation, the argument
claims that Napoleon III is acting like Louis XII, who rebuilt the
French army (and harnessed its power in military campaigns),
suggesting that this provides another reason to be wary of him. The
reference makes visual sense given that Louis XII was known as the
&ldquo;porcupine&rdquo; King of France, having adopted the animal as
his royal emblem&ndash;an emblem he favoured because it was popularly
believed that a porcupine could shoot its quills, symbolizing an
army&rsquo;s ability to shoot.</p>

<p>
In many circumstances, as in this one, the visual elements of an
argument (like many words in arguments) are open to multiple
interpretations. In the practical evaluation of arguments, the
simplest way to mange this is by identifying, distinguishing, and
evaluating all the plausible interpretations of an argument.</p>

<h3>2.4 Multimodal Arguing</h3>

<p>
Informal logicians who advocate for systems of IL that broaden the
language of argument from NL to NL+ sometimes expand the standard
notion of argument still further, beyond verbal and visual arguments,
to make room for other ways of arguing.</p>

<p>
This reflects the role of non-verbal carriers of meaning in real-life
discourse, something that allows many different semiotic modes to play
a role in arguments. In view of this, some argue that a fully
comprehensive account of real-life argument must include a
&ldquo;multimodal&rdquo; account of meaning which recognizes many
different <em>modes of arguing</em> (see Ki&scaron;i&#269;ek 2025,
Tseronis and Forceville 2017, and
 <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10503-014-9336-0" target="other">Groarke 2015</a>).
 The modes in question are intended as a way to make room for the role
that gestures, facial expressions, sounds of different sorts, prosodic
speech, tastes, smells, musical notes, and a host of other non-verbal
phenomena play in arguing.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;auditory&rdquo; (or &ldquo;acoustic&rdquo;) modes of
arguing is employed when reasoning depends on non-verbal sounds (see
Groarke 2018 and Ki&scaron;i&#269;ek 2014)&ndash;when a siren is taken
as evidence that the police are on their way, the sound of an
automobile engine (or an irregular heart) is the basis of an inference
to the conclusion that it has a leaky valve, and so on.</p>

<p>
Other modes of arguing invoke the senses in other ways. p> Here is an
example from a wine tasting.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 5:
<br />

<p>
A wine steward attempts to convince a customer that Napa Valley
&ldquo;Frogs Leap PS 2015&rdquo; is an exceptional Petite Syrah by
quoting high praise in a wine guide, and by handing them a glass,
inviting them to taste it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this case, the steward provides evidence for the claim that Frogs
Leap PS 2015 is an exceptional Petite Syrah in two ways: (i) via a
verbal premise that cites the authority of a wine guide, and (ii) via
a taste test that aims to support this conclusion. In the first case,
the result is a verbal appeal to authority, in the second an argument
from taste.</p>

<p>
In 2019, Space Cargo Unlimited and the University of Bordeaux&rsquo;s
wine institute (the ISVV) shipped fourteen bottles of Ch&acirc;teau
Petrus to the International Space Station to determine how a year in
space would affect their taste and character. A year later, the wine
returned to earth, where it was analyzed. The methods of analysis
included a blind tasting by 12 sommeliers who compared the wine from
space to bottles of the same vintages that had remained on earth. They
concluded that the wine that had been in space had a different,
distinct (&ldquo;more evolved&rdquo;) taste. The conclusion that this
is true depends on an argument from authority, but the conclusions of
the sommeliers themselves are based on an argument from taste (the
tastings they compared functioning as &lsquo;taste
premises&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
In real life arguments different modes are often mixed. In the case of
verbal arguments, the meaning of oral arguments often depends on the
prosodic features of an arguer&rsquo;s voice &mdash; features that can
convey meanings beyond those inherent in the words they utter. As
Gilbert (1997) says, uttering the sentence &ldquo;Fine, fine,
you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m wrong, we&rsquo;ll do it your
way,&rdquo; &ldquo;can indicate agreement with what has been said if
presented flatly and intended sincerely, or, if accompanied by an
expression of anger, can mean that the respondent does not agree at
all, but is capitulating.&rdquo; (pp. 2&ndash;3) Ki&scaron;i&#269;ek
2014 highlights the important role that the paralinguistic features of
oral arguments play in many instances of verbal argument.</p>

<h3>2.5 Emotional (Visceral, and Kisceral) Modes of Arguing</h3>

<p>
Michael Gilbert was the first informal logician to suggest that there
are different &ldquo;modes of arguing.&rdquo; His
&ldquo;multi-modal&rdquo; theory (with an emphasis on the hyphen)
understands arguing as an attempt to resolve disagreements that arise
when interlocutors have conflicting attitudes, beliefs, feelings and
intuitions. Successful arguments bring about the
&ldquo;coalescence&rdquo; of competing points of view.</p>

<p>
Gilbert 1997 provides a book length exposition of his theory. It
suggests that traditional logical and philosophical ideals promote a
&ldquo;classical logical&rdquo; mode of argument. Arguing in this mode
is dispassionate and unemotional, aiming at truth that is established
via sequences of verbally defined propositions that abide by strict,
linear notions of proof. Gilbert believes that arguments of this sort
play a role in attempts to resolve real-life disagreements but
maintains that such attempts frequently employ other modes of
arguing.</p>

<p>
In his discussion, Gilbert identifies three alternative modes tied to
&ldquo;emotional,&rdquo; &ldquo;visceral&rdquo; (physical) and
&ldquo;kisceral&rdquo; (intuitive) arguments. Arguing in these modes
invokes emotions and attitudes, physical demonstrations and difficult
to define intuitions. In many cases they are communicated via
non-verbal semiotic modes. This means that a forlorn look or tears may
count as premises in an argument when they are used to promote
coalescence (and inference in this broad sense). One example is
&ldquo;an argument friends had about whether a woman could be a police
officer. The man said, &lsquo;Women can&rsquo;t be cops&rsquo; and the
woman replied by flipping him over her shoulder. This was an argument,
and it was visceral in nature.&rdquo; (Gilbert and Carozza, 2024)</p>

<p>
Like multimodal, semiotic modes, Gilbert&rsquo;s account of modes radically
expands what counts as argument beyond the printed language emphasized
in early versions of IL (moving from L to a very broad L+). In an
account of the &ldquo;anthropology&rdquo; of argument, Tindale 2021
defends the alternative &ldquo;logics&rdquo; that Gilbert&rsquo;s views make
possible.</p>

<h3>2.6 Narratives as Argument</h3>

<p>
The expansion of IL in ways designed to recognize for an ever-broader
range of ways in which arguments can be conveyed is evident in
discussions of the use of stories in argument. One finds an
illustrative example in Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, where Glaucon
uses the mythical story of &ldquo;The Ring of Gyges&rdquo; to prove
that humans are inherently selfish. In this and many other situations,
different kinds of stories (anecdotes, accounts of some historical
event, biographies, fables, parables, morality plays, etc) are
designed to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; some point of view. It has often been
said that a novel is an argument for socialism, freedom of expression,
or some other value.</p>

<p>
The argumentative use of narratives can be understood in a variety of
ways: as rhetorical embellishment, as a form of generalization (the
characters in a story functioning as variables), as argument by
analogy, or as reasoning that requires the development of unique
standards of argument assessment. According to Fisher 1987, argument
itself is best understood as narrative. According to Nussbaum 1990,
literature is a way to better understand, and argue about, complex
moral situations. Within informal logic, Walton, Reed, and Macagno
2008 identify narrative-based schemes of argument while others
continue to debate the role that narratives play in ordinary argument
(see Govier and Ayer 2013, Olmos 2014, Plumer 2015).</p>

<h3>2.7 Comparing Systems of IL</h3>

<p>
The study of IL still focuses on the study of particular systems of
informal logic and the ways and their application to specific kinds of
argument. One key question is the extent to which they can be said to
be &ldquo;complete&rdquo;&ndash;insofar as they provide a logic that
can account for all arguments within their scope or, more broadly, the
extent to which they can provide a comprehensive account of the many
different forms of argument that occur in real-life reasoning. Other
meta issues include questions that might be asked about the
relationship between different informal logics.</p>

<p>
Groarke 2020 has outlined a &ldquo;BLAST&rdquo; approach to the
identification and definition of systems of IL. It defines a specific
informal logic system IL, as I = {B,L,A,S,T} where:</p>

<ul>

<li>B = the theoretical background that informs IL,
<br />
</li>

<li>L = the language used to express arguments,
<br />
</li>

<li>A = a concept of argument,
<br />
</li>

<li>S = a way to &ldquo;standardize&rdquo; arguments, and
<br />
</li>

<li>T = tools and methods for testing the strength of arguments.
<br />
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A particular IL can be defined by outlining and explaining each of its
five BLAST elements. Once defined, different systems of informal logic
and the elements they contain can be compared, contrasted, and
evaluated. Historical precursors of IL, formal logics, and other
systems of reasoning can be included in a review of systems of this
sort.</p>

<p>
Systems of informal logic that adopt a fallacy approach can be
summarized as instances of IL in which IL = {B,L,A,S,T}, where: B =
Fallacy Theory, and T = a set of fallacies used to judge instances of
argument. An even narrower set of (&ldquo;Hamblin&rdquo;) systems,
rooted in Hamblin 1970, can be defined as systems in which B = Hamblin
1970.</p>

<p>
In a deductivist system of informal logic, the V in the AV criteria
for good arguments is this classical notion of validity. Different
sets of argument schemes (or the elementary forms of argument in the
Periodic Table of Arguments) can function as general AV criteria that
define a corresponding informal logic.</p>

<p>
Popular versions of IL tend to combine different ways of evaluating
arguments. In view of this, T in a system tends to be some combination
of tools that can be used in this endeavor. In most cases, T = {F, AV,
AS}, where F is some list of fallacies; AV provides criteria for
judging premise acceptability and validity (deductively, inductively,
conductively, and/or abductively, etc.; and AV is some set of
argumentation schemes). That said, systems of informal logic can
accommodate other, less common criteria for deciding whether arguments
are good or bad, strong or weak&ndash;criteria founded on a
virtue-based approach to argument (see
 <a href="http://www.academia.edu/5620761/Virtues_and_Arguments" target="other">Virtues and Arguments)</a>,
 on feminist principles, or on notions derived from rhetoric, theories
of communication, or other cognate fields.</p>

<p>
The issues raised by the different kinds of standards that govern
arguing in different kinds of dialogue can be be accommodated by
formulating complex testing systems that include different criteria
which apply to different kinds of dialogue. An over-arching system
that aggregates these different criteria may be the best way to build
a truly comprehensive account of real life reasoning.</p>

<h2><a id="Eva">3. Standardizing Arguments</a></h2>

<p>
The ultimate aim of informal logic is normative: i.e. logics that
provide us with tools that can be used to evaluate real life arguments
and the key elements they contain. Because there are many contexts in
which the latter are unclear or not explicit, a first step in the
analysis of a real-life argument is an attempt to
&ldquo;standardize&rdquo; the argument by identifying its premises,
conclusions, and inferences.</p>

<p>
This can be a complex process that must untangle issues that obscure
the structure and content of a real-life argument. Standardizing
clarifies the structure of an argument in ordinary discourse by:</p>

<ul>

<li>discarding irrelevant and distracting digressions, repetition, and
remarks (&ldquo;noise&rdquo;) which do not play a role in the
reasoning the argument contains;</li>

<li>restating the content of rhetorical questions (&ldquo;Can anyone
seriously believe...?&rdquo; &ldquo;Could the defendant have been in
two places at once?&rdquo;)and other stylistic devices that may
obscure the meaning of the argument&rsquo;s components;</li>

<li>clarifying incomplete, vague or ambiguous claims and utterances;
and/or</li>

<li>recognizing components of the argument which are not explicitly
expressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Different systems of IL may standardize arguments in different ways.
In its simplest form, a standardized argument is a list of premises
and a conclusion (the argument&rsquo;s inference is the implied move
from the premises to the conclusion). EXAMPLE 6 can be standardized as
follows.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 6:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>The weather report indicates heavy rain this afternoon, so you
should take an umbrella to work.</li>
</ul> EXAMPLE 6 STANDARDIZED:
<br />

<ul>

<li><em>Premise</em>: The weather report indicates heavy rain this
afternoon.</li>

<li><i>Conclusion</i>: You should take an umbrella to work.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
In EXAMPLE 6, the word &ldquo;so&rdquo; functions as an
&ldquo;inference indicator&rdquo;. It tells us that the claim that
follows is a premise offered in support of the conclusion which
precedes it. In other cases, words like &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
&ldquo;given that,&rdquo; &ldquo;since,&rdquo; are ways of introducing
premises, while words like &ldquo;so,&rdquo; &ldquo;hence,&rdquo;
&ldquo;thus,&rdquo; &ldquo;therefore,&rdquo; are used to introduce
conclusions. Verbal inference indicators are a helpful, but not
necessary or sufficient, sign of argument. For indicator words can be
used in other ways (&ldquo;because&rdquo; may indicate an explanation
rather than an argument, a causal connection, emphasis of some sort, a
temporal order, etc.), and everyday arguers tend to treat them as
unnecessary when a context makes it clear that they are providing
reasons for a conclusion.</p>

<h3>3.1 Implicit Premises and Conclusions</h3>

<p>
One issue that frequently arises in standardization is an
argument&rsquo;s dependence on premises and conclusions which are not
explicitly stated.</p>

<p>
The following report from the New Hampshire <em>Rockingham News</em>
(30/8/2002) comments on a court case which sent the organizer of dog
fights to jail for cruelty to animals.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 7:
<br/>

<p>
A co-ordinator for the Humane Society supported a prison sentence,
claiming that the minor penalties normally associated with misdemeanor
convictions are not a sufficient deterrent in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can standardize the co-ordinator&rsquo;s argument as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Premise</em>: The minor penalties normally associated with
misdemeanor convictions are not a sufficient deterrent in this case.
<br />
<em>Implicit Premise 1</em> Penalties for crimes should have a
deterrent effect.
<br/>
<em>Implicit Premise 2</em>: Prison will have a more sufficient
deterrent effect.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: A prison sentence, but not the minor penalties
normally associated with misdemeanor convictions, is appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In an analysis of the argument it is important to recognize the
assumptions rendered as <em>Implicit Premise 1</em> and <em>Implicit
Premise 2</em> (which provide a &ldquo;warrant&rdquo; for the
inference). For these are claims the argument depends on. If it is not
true that penalties for crimes should have a deterrent effect, or not
true that prison has such an effect, then the premises of the argument
do not establish its conclusion.</p>

<p>
Recognizing an argument&rsquo;s implicit premises prepares the way for
argument evaluation, for these premises, like an argument&rsquo;s
explicit premises, need to be evaluated when the argument is assessed.
If we reject the implicit premises (in the present case, by arguing
that the goal of criminal penalties should be restitution, not
deterrence), then the argument fails to provide convincing evidence
for the conclusion it proposes.</p>

<p>
Arguments with implicit premises or conclusions are recognized in
traditional discussions of <em>enthymemes</em>: syllogisms with
unstated premises. A contemporary example is the American
Vice-President Dick Cheney&rsquo;s defense of the Bush
administration&rsquo;s decision not to try foreigners charged with
terrorism offenses as prisoners of war (to avoid granting those
accused of terrorism the same legal protections).</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 8 (from a report in the <em>New York Times</em>, 15/11/2001):
<br/>

<p>
&ldquo;The basic proposition here is that somebody who comes into the
United States of America illegally ... is not a lawful combatant....
They don&rsquo;t [therefore] deserve to be treated as a prisoner of
war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can standardize the argument as:</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 8:
<br />
<em>Premise</em>: Anyone who comes into the United States of America
illegally ... is not a lawful combatant.
<br />
<em>Implicit Premise</em>: All people who deserve to be treated as
prisoners of war are people who are lawful combatants.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: Anyone who comes into the United States of
America illegally doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be treated as a prisoner of war.
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>
As in many other cases, this argument&rsquo;s implicit premise
identifies the link that ties the explicit premise to the conclusion.
In other enthymemes, the conclusion of an argument may be implicit. In
a debate over the question whether witnesses to a particular crime can
be trusted, an arguer might state: &ldquo;<em>They</em> are friends of
the accused, and no friends of the accused can be trusted.&rdquo; In
this context, such claims clearly imply that the witnesses cannot be
trusted. This is a claim that needs to be recognized as an implicit
conclusion in an attempt to standardize this argument.</p>

<p>
As in the case of verbal arguments, implicit premises and conclusions
play a role in visual and multimodal arguments. In EXAMPLE 9 (below),
the title &ldquo;Just Add Vodka&rdquo; is superimposed over a gigantic
bottle of vodka splashing its contents onto the scene below. Outside
the resultant vodka splash, we see a sleepy rural hamlet. Inside the
splash, the hamlet is transformed into a bustling cityscape complete
with skyscrapers, a nightlife, search lights, people, nightclubs,
bars, and restaurants.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="vodka.jpg" alt="vodka print ad" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">EXAMPLE 9</span></p>
</div>

<p>
The image in the advertisement is an obvious visual metaphor which
suggests that vodka can transform one&rsquo;s life in the way that it
transforms the scene in the advertisement, turning the (dreary) life
one lives in a sleepy hamlet into the kind of exciting nightlife one
finds in a cosmopolitan urban center. Insofar as it is featured in an
advertisement, we can plausibly understand this message as a
<em>reason</em> why one should &ldquo;Just add Vodka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
We might standardize this visual argument as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 9:
<br />
<em>(Visual) Premise</em>: The image [which conveys the message that
adding vodka can transform your sleepy night life, as it transforms
the quiet village in the image into an exciting urban landscape]
<br />
<em>Implicit Premise</em>: An exciting urban nightlife is preferable
to a quiet night in a village.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: You should &ldquo;Just Add Vodka&rdquo; to your
life.
</blockquote>

<p>
I have treated the image in the advertisement as the first premise in
this argument because it is the metaphorical transformation it
visually depicts that is the core claim that it depends on. The
implicit premise in the argument is not explicitly stated (verbally or
visually) but it is a key assumption that allows the move from the
visual premise to the verbal conclusion.</p>

<p>
So understood, we can critique the argument in poster, for this
analysis reveals it as an argument with a dubious visual premise (that
vodka can transform your sleepy life into one of urban excitement); a
questionable implicit premise (for one might in many ways argue that
life in a quiet village is a better life than one in the middle of a
bustling metropolis), and an inference which is an instance of the
fallacy &ldquo;Affirming the Consequent&rdquo;(for there are better
ways to secure an exciting nightlife, if that is what one is
after).</p>

<p>
The attempt to identify implicit premises or conclusions in an
argument raises some significant theoretical questions, for all
arguments rely on (many) assumptions, and unstated premises or a
conclusion can often be interpreted in different ways. One principle
often used in choosing between alternative interpretations of an
implicit argument component is the &ldquo;Principle of Charity.&rdquo;
It favors an interpretation of an argument which makes the argument as
credible as possible. In many situations, this can best be
accomplished by assigning the argument a &ldquo;logically
minimum&rdquo; implicit premise, understood as the weakest component
needed to successfully connect the argument&rsquo;s premises to its
conclusion.</p>

<h3>3.2 Key Component Tables and Diagrams</h3>

<p>
Standardizing arguments by listing their premises and conclusions is
one way to delineate the content of an argument and prepare it for
evaluation. But standardizing of this sort does not distinguish
between different kinds of inferences an argument may contain. One way
to address the issues that this raises is by standardizing an argument
with a table that catalogues an argument&rsquo;s premises and
conclusions (with a Key Component or &ldquo;KC&rdquo; table),
combining it with an argument diagram (a &ldquo;mapping&rdquo;) that
depicts the inferences it depends upon.</p>

<p>
In EXAMPLE 10 (below), I have used this method to standardize an
argument that Kretzmann uses in his account of the medieval
philosopher William of Sherwood, whn he concludes that it is likely
that William was a Master at the University of Paris. The first column
of the KC table lists the premises and conclusion of the argument; the
second assigns them their role as premise or conclusion; the third
lists the source from which they are derived. The diagram that follows
depicts the relationships between the argument&rsquo;s key components,
using arrows to indicate the inferences it includes.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="TableDiagram1.jpg" alt="image text" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">EXAMPLE 10</span></p>
</div>

<p>
This form of standardization depicts the Sherwood argument as one that
is supported by three independent &ldquo;convergent&rdquo; premises
that provide three separate reasons for thinking that the
argument&rsquo;s conclusion is true.</p>

<p>
In other instances of argument, two or more &ldquo;linked&rdquo;
premises combine to support a conclusion with a single inference. The
argument &ldquo;The murderer was very strong, so George cannot be the
murderer.&rdquo; (EXAMPLE 11) is an enthymeme which assumes that
&ldquo;George is not very strong.&rdquo; Using square brackets ([ ])
to indicate this implicit component, we can standardize the argument
with the following KC table and diagram. In this case, the linked
premises are indicated with a plus sign (&ldquo;+&rdquo;) that
indicates that they support the argument&rsquo;s conclusion (only) when
combined.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="TableDiagram2.jpg" alt="image text" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">EXAMPLE 11</span></p>
</div>

<p>
When arguments have non-verbal key components, visual and multimodal
premises and conclusions can be recognized in a key component table by
ostension, or by reproducing them in some way. Once they are
identified in a KC table, the inferences such arguments depend on can
be mapped in standard ways. The following table and diagram
standardizes EXAMPLE 3 (above). It shows that it contains an inference
from three linked premises (two visual and one verbal) to the
conclusion that there is water on the planet Mars.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="TableDiagram3.jpg" alt="image text" />
</div>

<p>
KC tables and diagrams are not the only way to diagram the structure
of real life arguments. Diagramming (&ldquo;mapping&rdquo;) has its
own history, which incorporates a great many ways of diagramming the
inferences in arguments. The utility of diagramming is already
recognized in Whately 1826 and, in the early twentieth century, in
Wigmore 1913. The latter develops a form of mapping (&ldquo;evidence
charts&rdquo;) specifically designed to portray and analyze complex
chains of judicial reasoning.</p>

<p>
The development of AI has kindled a renewed interest in forms of IL
diagrams supported by the development of associated software
(Rationale, Reason!Able, Araucaria, Athena, Compendium, Theseus) and
online aids (Debate Mapper, TruthMapping.Com, Argunet, Agora).</p>

<h3>3.3 &ldquo;Supplemented&rdquo; Standardizations</h3>

<p>
Standardizing prepares the way for argument evaluation by clarifying
the inference structure and the content of an argument. Other features
of an argument that are relevant to its assessment can be included in
a &ldquo;supplemented&rdquo; standardization that includes a
description of the context in which an argument is embedded. Three
aspects of arguments merit note in this regard.</p>

<p>
Rhetoric emphasizes the <em>audience</em> to which an argument is
addressed. Rhetorical effectiveness is a secondary interest when one
evaluates an argument from a logical point of view. But successful
arguments used in an attempt to convince a specific audience of some
point of view must be logically and rhetorically successful. A
convincing argument for the conclusion that the United Nations cannot
be trusted must, in view of this, address different issues when it is
directed at a Chinese, Norwegian, Kenyan, Israeli, Swiss, Palestinian,
etc. audience. As rhetoric emphasizes, this means that successful
arguers must construct their arguments in ways that respond to the
beliefs, attitudes and values of their intended audience (and in this
sense &lsquo;speak&rsquo; to them&ndash;see Tindale 2010, 2025).</p>

<p>
The goals of arguers are a second contextual factor that is may be
pertinent to note when one supplements the standardization of an
argument. As Hitchcock 2002 points out, acts of arguing may make a
declaration (&ldquo;The evidence shows that you committed an assault,
so I find you guilty as charged.&rdquo;); command or make a request
(&ldquo;You were there, so you must tell us what happened.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The children are shivering, please close the door.&rdquo;);
make a promise (&ldquo;I know it matters to you, so I promise to go
tomorrow.&rdquo;); express a sentiment (&ldquo;What we did was
inexcusable, so we beg your forgiveness&rdquo;); or function in some
other way.</p>

<p>
As Pinto and Gilbert emphasize, this means that the traditional aim of
arguments as logic understands them&ndash;to establish the truth or
plausible truth of some proposition&ndash;is not the only goal of
real-life argument. As Hoffman 2016 claims, an arguer may not argue to
prove some point of view, but to promote reflection and the raising of
important questions. In other contexts, an argument that accomplishes
the arguer&rsquo;s purpose in presenting it may produce: a suspension
of judgment; an emotional state like fear or hope; or some kind of
behavior.</p>

<p>
Walton and Krabbe 1995 and Walton 2007 accommodate some of the central
goals associated with real life arguments by distinguishing between
different kinds of <em>dialogues</em> in which arguing occurs. The
nature of a dialogue determines the types of argumentative moves
allowed within it, what kinds of questions and responses are
permitted, and what norms arguments must adhere to.</p>

<p>
The seven basic types of dialogue Walton and Krabbe distinguish can be
summarized as follows.</p>

<div class="indent">

<table class="hrules vert-top cellpad-small avoid-break">
<tr>
  <td><strong>Type</strong></td>

  <td>Reveal Deep Conflict</td> </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
In dialogues of inquiry, arguments are used as tools in an attempt to
establish what is true. So understood, arguments must adhere to strict
standards that determine what counts as evidence and counter-evidence
for some point of view. In bargaining, one engages in negotiation
dialogue, where the principle goal is an agreement that serves
one&rsquo;s interests.</p>

<p>
It is difficult to reconcile the norms of some dialogues with the
epistemic ideals that are the basis of arguing as IL understands it.
In eristic dialogue, arguing is combat and the aim is to vanquish
one&rsquo;s opponent (and humiliate them, ideally by wowing
one&rsquo;s audience with one&rsquo;s mental gymnastics). In doing so,
ultimatums, exaggerations, threats and insults are a permissible
element of arguing if they serve this end.</p>

<p>
Walton&rsquo;s dialogue typology leaves room for more narrowly defined
kinds of dialogue. Collective bargaining is a specific kind of
negotiation dialogue which is governed by legal rules and well
established practices that very precisely delineate what is and is not
allowed in bargaining. Different subdialogues are associated with
different norms, rules and practices.</p>

<p>
A third contextual factor that may warrant comment in a supplemented
standardization is the dialectical situation in which an argument
occurs. In his account of argument, Johnson 2000 distinguishes between
the &ldquo;illative&rdquo; core of an argument and the
argument&rsquo;s &ldquo;dialectical tier,&rdquo;. He understands the
former as a &ldquo;proto-argument&rdquo; which consists of a set of
premises offered in support of some conclusion. It is a foundational
kernel of the argument, but becomes an argument in the full sense only
when it engages the dialectical tier, weighing alternative points of
view, addressing the objections to the conclusion they suggest.</p>

<h2><a id="Tes">4. Testing Arguments</a></h2>

<p>
The fundamental goal of informal logic is normative: an account of
argument that can be used to determine when and whether real life
arguments are (from an epistemic point of view) strong or weak, good
or bad, convincing or unconvincing. Standardizing prepares arguments
for such assessment.</p>

<p>
Almost all systems of informal logics understand a good (strong)
argument to be an argument with &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; premises and
a &ldquo;valid&rdquo; inference (i.e. a conclusion that follows from
the premises. Hansen 2012 has argued that informal logic should follow
classical logic, and not concern itself with premise acceptability,
but its engagement with the use of real life arguments (and a desire
to evaluate them in a fulsome way) has produced a field that includes
this within argument evaluation.</p>

<h3>4.1 AV Criteria</h3>

<p>
In classical logic, an argument is (deductively) valid if it is
impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false. On
this account, the ultimate aim of arguing is a &ldquo;sound&rdquo;
argument: i.e. a valid argument with true premises.</p>

<p>
Within informal logic, the simplest criterion for good arguments is an
informal analogue of soundness. It understands a good argument to be
an argument that justifies its conclusion by providing good (strong,
credible, etc.) reasons for believing it. Within the argument, this
implies premises which are &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; and a conclusion
that follows from them. Following Johnson and Blair (1977, 1994), many
systems of informal logic adopt an <b>ARS</b> version of these
<b>AV</b> criteria, making &ldquo;Acceptability, Relevance and
Sufficiency&rdquo; the requirements for good argument. On this
account, premises are acceptable when they are true or acceptable in
some other way; relevant when they provide some (i.e. any) support for
the conclusion of the argument; and sufficient when they provide
enough support to warrant its acceptance &mdash; as likely, true,
plausible, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Premise Acceptability</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Within informal arguments, premises may be acceptable in different
ways. In the most obvious case, they are acceptable if they are
(likely) true and unacceptable if false.</p>

<p>
The truth criterion can be expanded to apply to visual premises, for
an image may be evaluated as a &ldquo;true&rdquo; or
&ldquo;false&rdquo; depiction of what it represents. A documentary
photograph or image is, for example, unacceptable when it represents a
situation in a misleading way. In an age of photo-shopping,
&lsquo;doctored&rsquo; images that misrepresent a subject they are
claimed to replicate make the distinction between true and false
documentary images an important one when one evaluates many visual
arguments.</p>

<p>
In cases in which truth is a criterion for acceptability, there may be
other criteria that must be satisfied as well. Even when a premise is
true, it may be unacceptable because it violates the rules of
interaction that govern the kind of dialogue in which it is embedded.
In a legal proceeding or a formal hearing, premises and arguments must
not entertain premises that violate their rules of procedure.</p>

<p>
In persuasion dialogues, an acceptable premise may need to be true,
but also acceptable to the members of this audience. As Aristotle says
in his <em>Rhetoric</em>, successful arguments in such situations need
to have premises that resonate with the <em>pathos</em> of an audience
(and do so in a way that does not undermine the character &mdash; the
<em>ethos</em> &mdash; of the arguer).</p>

<p>
The limits of the truth criterion of acceptability are evident in the
many circumstances in which real-life arguing takes place in
conditions of uncertainty--in which premises are (at best) plausible,
exploratory hypotheses, or points of view that are generally accepted
or assumed. Deeper philosophical issues are tied to questions about
the nature of truth. Moral and aesthetic claims, imperatives, and
emotions and expressions of emotion often play an important role in
real-life arguments, though they are not straightforwardly
propositional and it is unclear whether they can be called true or
false.</p>

<p>
The criterion of acceptability and unacceptability that can (and in
practice is) applied to premises which cannot easily be ascribed truth
values judges a premise to be acceptable to the extent to which it is
reasonable. In view of this, judgments of acceptability ultimately
rest on some account of the situations in which moral and aesthetic
judgments, emotions, and imperatives can be said to be reasonable.</p>

<p>
The VR production &ldquo;Kiya,&rdquo;, produced by the Emblematic
Group and Al Jazeera America, virtually recreates an incidence of
domestic abuse in support of the claim that the issues raised by such
abuse must be addressed. It is an argument, the visual and verbal
account of the story providing evidence designed to convince viewers
of this conclusion. A key element of the story-telling is its
emotional impact, the producer describing the production as an attempt
to use &ldquo;the immersive power of virtual reality: its ability to
generate intense empathy on the part of the viewer; to wring from the
audience the intense emotional connection that these stories
deserve&rdquo; (NYT, Jan 21, 2016).</p>

<p>
In such a situation, an attempt to assess an argument raises the
question whether the account of the circumstances in question is
acceptable in two ways: by providing (i) a true and (ii) an
emotionally fair and unbiased (i.e. reasonable) account of what
happened. In defense of a yes answer in both cases, it can be said
that the account of what happened is scrupulously founded on court
records and 911 calls recorded at the time, and presented in a
balanced way that provokes the feelings of empathy it elicits.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Inference Validity</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
In an attempt to account for a broad range of real life arguing, IL
has expanded traditional notions of premise acceptability. It has
moved in a similar way in the case of inference validity, expanding
both elements in the <b>AV</b> criteria for good argument.</p>

<p>
In the case of inference validity, this expansion has been
accomplished by treating deductive validity as traditionally construed
as one variant of inference validity. Alternatives are deductive
validity understood in a &ldquo;defeasible&rdquo; way (making a
judgment of validity tentative, and open to reversal if some
&ldquo;defeater&rdquo; undermines it), and a variety of non-deductive
ways in which premises may entail a conclusion.</p>

<p>
Many informal logics emphasize a distinction between deductive and
inductive validity. Sometimes inductive arguments are defined
narrowly&ndash;as inductive generalizations, and sometimes more
broadly&ndash;to include any argument that has premises which imply
that a conclusion is (only) probable or plausible. Govier 1987 dubs
the deductive/inductive distinction &ldquo;the great divide&rdquo; and
questions it, suggesting that there are other kinds of validity that
need to be recognized.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Conductive&rdquo; arguments support their conclusions by
accumulating non-decisive reasons in their favor. They are valid when
they collect enough reasons to warrant but not decisively prove their
conclusions (see Johnson and Blair 2011, and Possin 2016, for a
sceptical rejoinder). In a particular case, different elements of
evidence may suggest but not prove that someone charged with murder is
guilty but make the conclusion likely if enough evidence of this sort
is accumulated (a witness claims he pulled the trigger, the ballistics
report shows that the bullet came from a gun he owned, he wrote an
e-mail saying he would &ldquo;get&rdquo; the victim, etc.).</p>

<p>
Strong &ldquo;abductive&rdquo; arguments are convincing instances of
&ldquo;inference to the best explanation&rdquo; (see Harman 1965).
They recognize some facts, point out that they are entailed by some
hypothesis, and conclude that the hypothesis is true. Taken at face
value, abductive arguments appear to be instances of the deductive
fallacy &ldquo;affirming the consequent,&rdquo; but play an important
role to play in medical, scientific and legal inquiry (see Walton
2004).</p>

<h3>4.2 Fallacy Theory</h3>

<p>
<b>AV</b> criteria are in many ways an extension of classical logic&rsquo;s
notion of good argument. In their search for ways to deal with real
life arguments, some informal logicians have looked elsewhere for a
normative account of real-life arguments, reviving fallacy theory as
an alternative way to judge argument. Hamblin 1970 is a touchstone for
moves in this direction.</p>

<p>
Systems of informal logic that rely on fallacies test arguments by
asking whether their proponents are guilty of fallacious reasoning.
While there is no agreed-upon taxonomy of fallacies, many standard
fallacies play a role in systems of IL. They include formal fallacies
like affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent (but see
Burke 1994); and informal fallacies like <em>ad hominem</em>
(&ldquo;against the person&rdquo;), slippery slope, <em>ad
baculum</em> (&ldquo;appeal to threat or force&rdquo;), <em>ad
misericordiam</em> (&ldquo;appeal to pity&rdquo;), &ldquo;hasty
generalization,&rdquo; and &ldquo;two wrongs&rdquo; reasoning (as in
the maxim: &ldquo;two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right&rdquo;).
Textbooks often elaborate fallacies in ways that add more specialized
variants of the standard list of fallacies (&ldquo;misleading
vividness&rdquo; designating the misuse of vivid anecdotal evidence in
a hasty generalizations, and so on.)</p>

<p>
Woods and Walton 1982, Hansen and Pinto 1995, and
the entry on <a href="../fallacies/">fallacies</a>
provide detaileds accounts of fallacies. In
argumentation theory more broadly, van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992
understand fallacies as violations of the pragma-dialectical rules
that govern critical discussions. In an attempt to explain why
ordinary arguers are attracted to fallacies, Battersby and Bailin 2011
view them as patterns of argument that have more persuasive
(rhetorical) power than their probative value merits.</p>

<p>
Some fallacies &mdash; e.g., equivocation and begging the question
(circular reasoning) &mdash; highlight important logical issues that
arise in real-life arguing, but fallacy theory raises a number of
issues when it is adopted as a general account of argument. They
include its unsystematic nature, disagreements about the definition
and nature of specific fallacies, and the emphasis that it places on
faulty reasoning rather than good argument. Hitchcock (1995, 324)
writes that the idea that we should teach reasoning by fallacies is
&ldquo;like saying that the best way to teach somebody to play tennis
without making the common mistakes is to demonstrate these faults in
action and get him to label and respond to them&rdquo; (see Feldman
2009).</p>

<p>
The theoretical issues raised by fallacy theory are compounded by
instances of traditional fallacies which are legitimate arguments in
real-life arguing. Appeals to pity and other emotions have, to take
one example, a legitimate role to play in moral, political and
aesthetic debate. The following examples highlight other circumstances
in which arguments which fit the definition of a traditional fallacy
cannot be so readily dismissed.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 12: A remark from a Danish television debate over the question
whether the Danish church should be separated from the Danish state
(Jorgensen 1995, 369): &ldquo;You should not listen to my opponent. He
wants to sever the Danish church from the state for his own personal
sake.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a classic example of <em>ad hominem</em>, Kahane 1995 (p. 65),
describing the fallacy as one that occurs when an arguer attacks
&ldquo;his opponent rather than his opponent&rsquo;s evidence and
arguments.&rdquo; But this is a case in which an attack against an
opponent cannot be off handedly dismissed as a fallacy. It charges an
opponent with a conflict of interest, and this raises legitimate
questions about the extent to which their arguments should be
entertained.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 13: Martin Luther King Jr., influenced by Gandhi, argued that
one can justifiably break the law in a struggle for social justice.
</blockquote>

<p>
Arguments of this sort (which promote civil disobedience) play a
central role in civil rights movements. They respond to one wrong with
another, but cannot be summarily dismissed as instances of the fallacy
&ldquo;two wrongs make a right.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE 14: Early in World War II, Winston Churchill argued against
the Munich Agreement (which ceded part of Czechoslovakia to Germany)
arguing that it would embolden Nazi Germany, produce more German
aggression, and ultimately endanger Britan&rsquo;s security and
independence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a &ldquo;slippery slope argument&rdquo; that argues that
something should not be done because it will precipitate a chain of
causes that ultimately produce some undesirable end. One might debate
whether it was convincing argument at the time, but it cannot be
summarily dismissed as fallacious (many viewing it as a sound argument
that should have been heeded at the time).</p>

<p>
Examples of this sort have forced careful accounts of fallacies to
make room for reasonable arguments which have the form of traditional
fallacies. In doing so, one can distinguish between fallacies which do
and do not have non-fallacious instances. Equivocation, <em>post hoc
ergo propter hoc</em>, <em>non sequitor</em> and hasty generalization
are, for example, forms of argument that seem inherently mistaken. In
contrast, traditional fallacies like <em>ad hominem</em>, two wrongs
reasoning, guilt by association, and appeal to pity define patterns of
reasoning which can play a legitimate logical role within real life
reasoning (and are, in view of this, sometimes treated as argument
&ldquo;schemes&rdquo; rather than fallacies).</p>

<h3>4.3 Natural Language Deductivism</h3>

<p>
Natural Language Deductivism (&ldquo;NLD&rdquo;) is an approach to
informal reasoning that retains classical logic&rsquo;s focus on
deductive validity (see Groarke 2025a). It interprets informal
arguments as deductively valid inferences that rely, in situations in
which this is not obvious, on assumptions that make the argument
implicitly deductive.</p>

<p>
The discussion of NLD has been muddled by the notion that deductive
validity as a form of inference that is tied to certain conclusions.
This is a misconception that founded on deductive validity&rsquo;s
historical connections to formal logic and mathematics (and the idea
that the proofs they propose have certain conclusions). But there is
no necessary connection between deductive reasoning and certainty,
deductive validity ensuring only that the conclusion of an argument is
<em>as</em> likely true (and certain) as its premises. In real-life
arguing, which tends to be characterized by uncertainty, this means
that deductive arguments usually produce conclusions that are likely,
plausible, or probable (not certain).</p>

<p>
EXAMPLE 15 is taken from a radio commentary on population growth.</p>

<blockquote>
EXAMPLE 15: The population of the world will grow from 6 to 9 billion
in the next fifteen years so we will, if we are to provide sufficient
food for everyone, need to find a way to provide food for an
additional 3 billion people.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a deductively valid argument with a premise that is reasonably
judged to be true (but not certain), yielding a conclusion that is
similarly reasonable (but uncertain). Deductively valid arguments
yield certain conclusions only when their premises are certain and
this is rarely the case within informal arguments of the sort that IL
emphasizes.</p>

<p>
NLD&rsquo;s plausibility (or implausibility) as a system of IL turns
on its account of arguments which are not prima facie deductive. In
the analysis of arguments of this sort, it preserves the deductivist
approach by attributing an implicit premise (essentially, a deductive
warrant) to such arguments in a way that deductively entails an
argument&rsquo;s conclusion. Typically, this implicit premise is an
&ldquo;associated&rdquo; conditional of the form &ldquo;If P, then
C&rdquo; where P is the argument&rsquo;s premises and C is its
conclusion.</p>

<p>
A 2015 blog by a professional dietician (Dr. Cristina Sutter)
criticizes arguments that justify the claim that garcinia cambogia is
a miracle weight loss pill by appealing to the authority of the
popular television personality &ldquo;Dr. Oz.&rdquo; &mdash; an appeal
that is an instance of the reasoning &ldquo;Dr. Oz Says It, So It Must
Be True.&rdquo; We can standardize the argument and the pattern of
argument she criticizes as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE 16:
<br />
<em>Premise</em>: Dr. Oz says: that gracinia cambogia is a miracle
weight loss pill.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: This must be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If one judges by the explicit premise in this argument (&ldquo;Dr. Oz
says...&rdquo;), this is not a deductively valid argument, for it is
obvious that the premise could be true and the conclusion false: Dr.
Oz could say gracinia cambogia is a miracle weight loss pill and
(obviously) be wrong. The deductivist can still treat this as a
deductive argument by recognizing its associated conditional as an
implicit premise, allowing us to standardize the argument as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Premise</em>: Dr. Oz says [that gracinia cambogia is a miracle
weight loss pill].
<br />
<em>Implicit Premise</em>: If Dr. Oz says this, it must be true.
<br />
<em>Conclusion</em>: This must be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So understood, the Dr. Oz argument is deductively valid, but still an
unsound argument, for this makes it a valid argument with a
problematic implicit premise.</p>

<p>
NLD deals with inductive generalizations in a similar way. Consider
the following example from a conversation about French men.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE 17:
<br />
&ldquo;French men are fastidious about their appearance. I have worked
with many and this was what I found.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this example, the move from the premise to the conclusion of the
argument assumes that the sample of French men the arguer is familiar
with are a representative sample of French men. If this is not likely,
then the sample does not provide a good reason for concluding that
French men are, in general, as fastidious if they are. If we recognize
this assumption as an implicit premise when we standardize the
argument, then the argument is deductively valid, for a representative
sample is a subset of a population that has traits which are the
traits of the larger group.</p>

<p>
In this way, NLD turns the uncertainty that characterizes inductive
generalizations (and other forms of informal validity) into
uncertainty that is tied to the associated conditional which warrants
the move from an argument&rsquo;s premises to its conclusion. This
does not eliminate such uncertainty, but maintains it as a key
consideration in argument evaluation, for it makes the status of this
warrant an essential element of premise acceptability.</p>

<p>
In favor of NLD, it has been argued that reconstruction of many
arguments it proposes is a dialectically useful way to make explicit
the key assumptions that arguments depend on, and frees us from the
need to distinguish between different kinds of validity in ways that
can be problematic when they are applied to real life arguing. The
pragma-dialectical account of indirect speech acts (Eemeren and
Grootendorst 2002, Groarke 1999) provides a way to reconstruct
arguments as deductive arguments when NLD requires it, though Johnson
2000 and Godden 2004 have argued that NLD is an artificial theory
which forces informal arguments to adhere to an overly restrictive
model of inference.</p>

<h3>4.4 Argument(ation) Schemes</h3>

<p>
Argument (or &ldquo;argumentation&rdquo;) schemes are recurring
patterns of reasoning. Once identified they can be used to evaluate an
argument which is instance of a scheme, or as a template or recipe
arguers can use when they construct an argument which is an instance
of a scheme. Walton, Reed and Macagno 2008 provide a compendium of 96
schemes. Wageman has developed a
 <a href="https://periodic-table-of-arguments.org/" target="other">Periodic Table of Arguments</a>
 which provides a systematized account of elementary forms of argument
that can be understood as basic schemes.</p>

<p>
Rules of inference like <em>modus ponens</em> and <em>modus
tollens</em> can be understood as deductive schemes. Other schemes
that play a prominent role in real-life arguing include Argument by
Sign, Argument by Analogy, Argument by Example, and Slippery Slope
Reasoning. Dove 2016 and Groarke 2019 suggested that visual arguments
with non-verbal visual elements may be instances of common schemes,
and are in some cases instances of schemes that are inherently
visual.</p>

<p>
The most common approach to argument schemes combines a pattern of
argument with a set of &ldquo;critical questions&rdquo; with which it
is associated. The scheme <em>Argument from Authority</em>
(&ldquo;Appeal to Authority,&rdquo; &ldquo;Appeal to Expert
Opinion&rdquo;) and the critical questions it raises can be formally
defined as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Argument from Authority Scheme:</em>
<br/>
A is an authority in domain D.
<br />
A says that T is true.
<br />
T is within D.
<br />
(Therefore) T is true.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<em>Critical questions</em>:
<br />
1. How credible is A?
<br />
2. Is A an authority in domain D?
<br />
3. What did A assert that implies T?
<br />
4. Is A someone who can be trusted?
<br />
5. Is T consistent with what other experts assert?
<br />
6. Is A&rsquo;s assertion of T based on evidence?
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>
Prakken 2010b understands argument schemes as inference rules. On this
account, some critical questions ensuring the truth of an
argument&rsquo;s premises, others ensuring that the context of the
inference is appropriate. Another approach to schemes builds the
answers to critical questions into a &lsquo;full&rsquo; definition of
the scheme, treating them as required premises in convincing instances
of the scheme. Taking this approach, the scheme <em>Argument from
Authority</em> can be defined as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A is a credible authority in the domain D.
<br />
A asserted X, which implies T.
<br />
A can be trusted and T is within domain D.
<br />
T is consistent with what other experts in domain D assert.
<br />
A&rsquo;s assertion of T is based on evidence.
<br />
(Therefore) T is true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The critical question approach to schemes suggests that a credible
argument from authority must include acceptable premises of the form
outlined in the definition of the scheme, and is valid if it can be
backed by answers to the scheme&rsquo;s critical questions. Taking the
&lsquo;full&rsquo; approach, a valid argument from authority must
include the premises that define it as as a good argument as explicit
(or possibly implicit) premises. In both cases, the result is an
account of premise acceptability and validity tailored to arguments
from authority.</p>

<p>
When a student essay claims that &ldquo;we should not stockpile
nuclear weapons&rdquo; because Einstein told us that this would lead
&ldquo;to destruction even more terrible than the present destruction
of life&rdquo; (EXAMPLE 18), they appeal to Einstein as an authority.
In order for it to be a convincing argument from authority, it would
need to fully satisfy the conditions outlined in our definition of the
scheme <em>Argument from Authority</em>.</p>

<p>
The attempt to satisfy the requirements this implies produces a
version of the argument which can be summarized as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
EXAMPLE 18 <em>expanded to satisfy the criteria for a convincing
argument from authority</em>:
<br />
1. Einstein (A) is a credible authority on nuclear weapons (D).
<br />
2. Einstein (A) asserted that the stockpiling of nuclear weapons would
precipitate &ldquo;destruction even more terrible than the present
destruction of life&rdquo; (X), which implies that we should not
stockpile nuclear weapons (T).
<br />
3. Einstein (A) can be trusted and questions about stockpiling nuclear
weapons (T) are questions about nuclear weapons (D).
<br />
4. The claim that we should not stockpile nuclear weapons (T) is
consistent with what other experts on nuclear weapons (D) assert.
<br />
5. Einstein&rsquo;s (A&rsquo;s) assertion that we should not stockpile
nuclear weapons (T) is based on evidence.
<br />
6. (Therefore) We should not stockpile nuclear weapons (T).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This analysis shows that EXAMPLE 18 fails to satisfy the conditions
for a good instance of argument from authority, for that requires
assent to the six claims in our list, and a number of them are
problematic. The latter include 4, for other experts on military
matters disagree with Einstein. More fundamentally, 1 is questionable
and is founded on too loose an account of nuclear weapons as a domain
of expertise. Einstein can be said to be a renowned expert on nuclear
physics, but this does not make him an expert on <em>the social and
political issues</em> raised by nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>
The scheme approach to argument assessment can rectify some of the
problems with the fallacy approach to argument evaluation. For those
traditional fallacies that have non-fallacious instances can be
understood, not as fallacies, but as argumentation schemes which
define legitimate forms of reasoning if they are properly employed.
Definitions of the fallacies in question can be turned into scheme
definitions in a relatively simple way: by identifying a list of
critical questions (or required premises) that specify what would make
the forms of argument in question valid.</p>

<p>
<em>Ad hominem</em> is a case in point, for there are many instances
in which criticisms of an arguer (rather than their position) are a
reasonable way to cast doubt on their views. We can specify when this
is so by listing critical questions that determine whether this is so
in a particular case of argument. The basic question that must be
asked is whether there is a good reason why the arguer&rsquo;s views
should not be taken seriously &mdash; a question that subsumes the
more specific questions whether they have repeatedly shown poor
judgment, are biased, lack expertise in the area in question, or are
for some other reason an arguer who should not be listened to.</p>

<p>
Treated in this way, <em>ad hominem</em> becomes a logically
legitimate scheme of argument. This does not change the fact that
there are (as there are in the case of all schemes) many instances of
the scheme that are instances of poor reasoning. These instances can
on this account be explained by a lack of adequate answers to the
critical questions that it raises. In this and many other cases, the
problems with traditional fallacies can be explained as deviations
from an inherently correct scheme of reasoning.</p>

<p>
Within argumentation theory, informal logic is tied to studies of
particular aspects of arguing (e.g., onus, burden of proof, or the
norms that govern arguments in specific contexts); the analysis of
arguments from historical, social, political or feminist points of
view; the study of particular kinds of argument (e.g., those expressed
in political works of art, those that arise in specific legal
contexts); and the discussion of the assumptions, conditions
(philosophical, epistemological, social, political, institutional,
psychological, educational, etc.) which give rise to disagreement and
argumentation in the first place.</p>

<p>
Theoretically, argumentation theory unites three approaches to
argument that have been associated with logic, rhetoric, and
dialectics since ancient times. Logic treats an argument as an attempt
to justify a conclusion, focusing on its epistemic merit. Rhetoric
understands arguing as an attempt to persuade an audience, emphasizing
its persuasive force. Dialectics understands an argument as an attempt
to make a move in an exchange between interlocutors with opposing
points of view, tying it to an interaction between argumentative
opponents who argue back and forth.</p>

<p>
Though informal logic emphasizes the epistemic merit of an argument,
its development has been influenced by rhetorical and dialectical
considerations, in view of the role that arguments play in public
discussion and debate. For successful public arguments must convince
some intended audience (the public, ornithologists, Members of
Parliament, the readers of a particular magazine, etc.) of a point of
view and convincing arguments must (as Johnson 2000 emphasizes)
provide answers to reasonable objections made by interlocutors who
have opposing points of view. Bermejo Luque 2011 proposes a relevant
theory of argument which aims to accommodate logical, rhetorical and
dialectical points of view.</p>

<p>
A comprehensive series of essays that introduce to the issues that
matter to informal logic and argumentation theory can be found in
Aikin, Casey and Stevens, 2025 (and the Bondy 2025 contribution to
that anthology).</p>

<h2><a id="ILCont">5. IL in its Contexts</a></h2>

<p>
Informal logic&rsquo;s attempt to understand and assess argument as it
occurs in a broad range of real-life situations continues to evolve.
Its evolution is likely to integrate further investigations of
alternative argumentative traditions (notably, outside of Western
philosophy as it is usually understood), its international growth (in,
for example, China: see Chen 2023); and its ties to related field and
a broader &ldquo;argumentation theory.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>5.1 IL and &ldquo;Argumentation Theory&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Today&rsquo;s informal logic is part of a broader &ldquo;argumentation theory&rdquo;
that embraces the interdisciplinary study of real-life arguing. The
issues and approaches it includes are well outlined in the
 <a href="../argument/">argument and argumentation</a>
 entry in this encyclopedia. In many ways, it consolidates the
insights of formal and informal logic, pragma-dialectics (developed by
van Eemeren and Grootendorst), the Critical Thinking Movement,
American speech communication, rhetoric, pragmatics, AI and
computational modeling, and the Polish School of Argument (which has
published a relevant
 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10503-014-9320-8" target="other">manifesto</a>
 that reflects the goals of argumentation theory). In attempts to
understand argument, argumentation theorists do not hesitate to
include the findings of other related disciplines&ndash;among them,
cognitive psychology, semiotics, linguistics, marketing, discourse
analysis, the history of art, and so on.</p>

<p>

dialectical points of view.</p>

<h3>5.2 IL and Cognate Fields</h3>

<p>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as an important cognate
field. It relies on an understanding of informal reasoning as it
occurs in a wide array of contexts. Informal logic has influenced its
attempts to model argumentation between agents in multi-agent systems
which mimic or assist human reasoning. Computational models have been
applied to large-scale collections (&lsquo;webs&rsquo;) of
inter-connected arguments, and to reasoning about medical decisions,
legal issues, chemical properties and other complex systems. Automated
argument assistance functions as a computational aid that can assist
in the construction of an argument. Verheij 2014 provides an overview
of the issues that this raises.</p>

<p>
Connected developments in the empirical study of real life reasoning
support the study of argument &ldquo;corpora&rdquo; &mdash; large
collections of argument drawn from natural language discourse. In an
early study of this sort, Jorgenson, Kock and Rorbech 1991 analyzed a
series of 37 one-hour televised debates from Danish public TV. The
debates featured well-known public figures arguing for and against
policy proposals. A representative audience of 100 voters voted before
and after the debate. Their conclusions were compared with standard
notions of &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and &ldquo;valid&rdquo; argumentation.
Other studies consider corpora made up of large databases of selected
written texts (see, e.g., Goodwin and Cortes 2010, and Mochales and
Ieven 2009).</p>

<p>
Argument mining is a subfield of data mining, or text mining (and
computational linguistics) that uses software and algorithms that
automatically process texts looking for argument structures &mdash;
for premises, conclusions, argumentation schemes, and extended webs of
argument. The texts studied include legal documents, on-line debates,
product reviews, academic literature, user comments on proposed
regulations, newspaper articles and court cases, as well as dialogical
domains.
 <a href="https://www.arg.tech/" target="other">ARG-tech</a>,
 the Centre for Argument Technology, has played a key role in studies
of this sort.</p>

<p>
As IL has broadened its account of argument beyond its traditional
emphasis on purely verbal arguments, Semiotics and Multimodal Rhetoric
have emerged as two other cognate fields of interest. They bring to
the discussion an in depth, well developed, understanding of
non-verbal meaning. Informal logic contributes the tools and concepts
it has developed in it in depth account of the nature of argument and
inference. The end result promises to be a much deeper understanding
of the role that semiotic modes play in ordinary argument, and the
ways in which they may be analyzed and judged from an IL point of view
(see St&ouml;ckl, Tseronis, and Wildfeuer 2025; St&ouml;ckl and
Tseronis 2024, and Tseronis and Forceville 2017).</p>

<p>
Other research relevant to informal logic highlights the many ways in
which the success of real-life arguments depends on aspects of
argumentation which are not clearly integrated into systems of
informal logic. The latter include an arguer&rsquo;s personal
credibility or standing (their <em>ethos</em>); their ability to
situate their argument within a context of debate; and their success
drawing attention to their argument (using, e.g., &ldquo;argument
flags&rdquo; that attract attention). The study of these and other
pragmatic, social, dialectical, semiotic and rhetorical features of
arguing will play a role in the continued development of IL.</p>

<h3>5.3 IL and Philosophy</h3>

<p>
Informal logic, like its historical precursors, is rooted in
philosophy. In the Western philosophical tradition, an interest in
accounts of argument that can be used, taught, and applied to everyday
arguments begins with the sophists&rsquo; fifth century boast that
they could teach others how to be successful arguers (see Tindale
2010). The logical tradition that such attempts give rise to is more
securely rooted in Aristotle&rsquo;s systematic account of reasoning. As I
noted at the start of this article, the history of ideas contains
numerous philosophically informed attempts to formulate a logic of
everyday argument that can be used to explain, evaluate, and teach
real life reasoning.</p>

<p>
The connections between IL and philosophy run in both directions.
Philosophy needs and relies upon some account of reasoning that is
invoked, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly, in its
arguments for different philosophical perspectives. Like any
arguments, these arguments can be analyzed and understood using the
tools and concepts of informal logic. Not surprisingly in view of
this, philosophy and informal logic share an interest in many of the
core epistemological raised by questions about evidence, knowledge,
and the extent to which any views can be justified.</p>

<p>
At the same time, the most notable feature of the development of
informal logic has been an ever broadening account of real-life
arguing. It shows that the richness of real-life arguments cannot be
adequately captured by classical logic so long as it clings to the
once assumed suggestion that arguments are collections of propositions
(&ldquo;bearers of truth value&rdquo;) that are correlates of
statements of fact. For real-life arguing constantly invokes moral,
aesthetic, and political claims, commands and imperatives, emotions,
gestures, facial expressions, images, sounds, and other non-verbal
carriers of meaning that cannot be reduced to propositions of this
sort. This is not a problem so much as an opportunity that invites a
broader epistemology that can inform the development of IL in a way
that recognizes the full complexity of truth, justification, reasoning
and argument as they occur in real-life contexts.</p>

<p>
Discussions of informal logic have influenced the discussion of core
philosophical issues, most notably in the case of epistemology and
philosophy of mind (evident in the work of Goldman 1999, Crosswhite
2013, Thagard 2011, Preyer and Mans 1999, and others). Recent
discussions emphasize the epistemic significance of arguments and
their use as epistemic tools (see the essays in Aikin, Casey and
Stevens, 2025, and the Bondy contribution in particular). Another
locus of discussion within informal logic addresses the social aspects
of argument and their relationship to issues of justice (epistemic and
otherwise) and power. Feminist responses to these issues are discussed
in another entry in this encyclopedia
 (<a href="../feminism-argumentation/">feminist perspectives on argumenation</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In 2000 Woods speculated on the reasons why IL has not played a larger
role in contemporary philosophy. In part, its position within
philosophy reflects the broader fragmentation of philosophy within
North America, Rescher 2005 (p. 4) writing that: &ldquo;The most
striking aspect of contemporary American philosophy is its
fragmentation. The scale and complexity of the enterprise is such that
if one seeks in contemporary American philosophy for a consensus on
the problem agenda, let alone for agreement on the substantive issues,
then one is predestined to look in vain. &rdquo;</p>

<p>
Both philosophy and informal logic share an interest in foundational
accounts of argument. Mercier and Sperber (2011) have claimed that
reasoning is a practice which has evolved from, and needs to be
understood in terms of, the social practice of argumentation. Johnson
2000 pushes in the opposite direction, arguing that a comprehensive
account of the practice of argument must be built upon a philosophical
account of rationality. Goldman 1999 situates knowledge in the social
interactions that take place within interpersonal exchange and
knowledge institutions, emphasizing informal argument and the
constraints which make it a valuable practice. A 2002 volume of
<em>Philosophica</em> on Hilary Putnam&rsquo;s philosophy suggests
pragmatism as an epistemology that best fits informal logic as a
discipline.</p>

<p>
In its current state of development, informal logic has become a field
that underscores the significance of philosophy at a time
characterized by doubts about its importance (and the importance of
the humanities more generally). In North America and elsewhere,
informal logic is a field in which philosophers apply theories of
argument (rationality, knowledge, etc.) to everyday arguments. In
keeping with this, philosophers continue to be the core contributors
to IL, and philosophy departments in colleges and universities
continue to be the core departments that teach the courses that teach
argumentation skills.</p>

<p>
The influence of informal logic courses on the hundreds of thousands
of students that enroll in them require that we at least qualify
Rescher&rsquo;s remark (2005, p. 22) that: &ldquo;The fact is that
philosophy has little or no place in American popular (as opposed to
academic) culture... philosophy nowadays makes virtually no impact on
the wider culture of North America.&rdquo; The extent to which
informal logic&rsquo;s attempt to broadly instill good reasoning
habits within public education and public discussion and debate is
difficult to judge.</p>

<p>
In this context, it can best be said that informal logic, like applied
ethics, has become a standard offering that helps sustain philosophy
departments in North America by contributing to what Rescher describes
as &ldquo;The rapid growth of &lsquo;applied philosophy&rsquo;
...[that] is a striking structural feature of contemporary North
American philosophy.&rdquo; (p. 9). The goal of applied philosophy is
philosophically informed and nuanced reasoning that is applied to
complex real life situations. IL is a field that continues to make
valuable contributions to this goal.</p>
