<h1>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 13, 1997; substantive revision Fri Sep 19, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Along with J.G. Fichte and, at least in his early work, F.W.J. von
Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770&ndash;1831) belongs to
the period of German idealism in the decades following Kant. The most
systematic of the idealists, Hegel attempted, throughout his published
writings as well as in his lectures, to elaborate a comprehensive and
systematic philosophy from a purportedly logical starting point. He is
perhaps most well-known for his teleological account of history, an
account that was later taken over by Karl Marx and
&ldquo;inverted&rdquo; into a materialist theory of an historical
development culminating in communism. While there were idealist
philosophies in Germany after Hegel, the movement commonly known as
German idealism effectively ended with Hegel&rsquo;s death. Certainly
after the revolutions in logical thought from the turn of the
twentieth century, the logical side of Hegel&rsquo;s thought was
largely forgotten, although his political and social philosophy and
theological views continued to find interest and support. Since the
1970s, however, more general philosophical interest in Hegel&rsquo;s
systematic thought and its logical basis has been revived.</p>

<h2 id="LifWorInf">1. Life, Work, and Influence</h2>

<p>
Born in 1770 in Stuttgart, Hegel spent the years 1788&ndash;1793 as a
student in nearby T&uuml;bingen, studying first philosophy and then
theology, and forming friendships with fellow students, the future
great romantic poet Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin (1770&ndash;1843) and
Friedrich von Schelling (1775&ndash;1854), who, like Hegel, would
become one of the major figures of the German philosophical scene in
the first half of the nineteenth century. These friendships clearly
had a major influence on Hegel&rsquo;s philosophical development, and
for a while the intellectual lives of the three were closely
intertwined.</p>

<p>
After graduation Hegel worked as a tutor for families in Bern and then
Frankfurt, where he was reunited with H&ouml;lderlin. Until around
1800, Hegel devoted himself to developing his ideas on religious and
social themes, and seemed to have envisaged a future for himself as a
type of modernising and reforming educator, in the image of figures of
the German Enlightenment such as Lessing and Schiller. Around the turn
of the century, however, under the influence of H&ouml;lderlin and
Schelling, his interests turned more to issues arising from the
<q>critical philosophy</q> initiated by Immanuel Kant
(1724&ndash;1804) and developed by J.G. Fichte (1762&ndash;1814). In
the 1790s the University of Jena had become a center for the
development of Kantian critical philosophy due to the presence of K.L.
Reinhold (1757&ndash;1823) and then Fichte, who taught there from 1794
until his dismissal on the grounds of atheism at the end of the
decade. By that time Schelling, who had first been attracted to Jena
by the presence of Fichte, had become an established figure at the
university. In 1801 Hegel moved to Jena to join Schelling, and in same
year published his first philosophical work, <em>The Difference
between Fichte&rsquo;s and Schelling&rsquo;s System of
Philosophy</em>, in which he argued that Schelling had succeeded where
Fichte had failed in the project of systematizing and thereby
completing Kant&rsquo;s transcendental idealism. In 1802 and 1803
Hegel and Schelling worked closely together, editing and contributing
to the <em>Critical Journal of Philosophy</em>, and on the basis of
this association Hegel came to be dogged for many years by the
reputation of being a &ldquo;mere&rdquo; follower of Schelling (who
was five years his junior).</p>

<p>
By late 1806 Hegel had completed his first major work, the
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (published 1807), which showed a
divergence from his earlier, seemingly more Schellingian, approach.
Schelling, who had left Jena in 1803, interpreted a barbed criticism
in the <em>Phenomenology</em>&rsquo;s preface as aimed at him, and
their friendship abruptly ended. The occupation of Jena by
Napoleon&rsquo;s troops as Hegel was completing the manuscript
restricted the activities of the university and Hegel departed. Now
without a university appointment, he worked for a short time,
apparently very successfully, as an editor of a newspaper in Bamberg,
and then from 1808 to 1815 as the headmaster and philosophy teacher at
a gymnasium (high school) in Nuremberg. During his time at Nuremberg
he married and started a family, and wrote and published his
<em>Science of Logic</em>. In 1816 he managed to return to his
university career by being appointed to a chair in philosophy at the
University of Heidelberg, but shortly after, in 1818, he was offered
and took up the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, the
most prestigious position in the German philosophical world. In 1817,
while in Heidelberg, he published the <em>Encyclopaedia of the
Philosophical Sciences</em>, a systematic work in which an abbreviated
version of the earlier <em>Science of Logic</em> (the
<em>Encyclopaedia Logic</em> or <em>Lesser Logic</em>) was followed by
the application of its principles to the philosophy of nature and the
philosophy of spirit. In 1821 in Berlin Hegel published his major work
in political philosophy, <em>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</em>,
based on lectures given at Heidelberg but ultimately grounded in the
section of the <em>Philosophy of Spirit</em> part of the
<em>Encyclopaedia</em> dealing with objective spirit. During the
following ten years up to his death in 1831 Hegel enjoyed celebrity at
Berlin, and published subsequent versions of the
<em>Encyclopaedia</em>. After his death versions of his lectures on
philosophy of history, philosophy of religion, aesthetics, and the
history of philosophy were published.</p>

<p>
After Hegel&rsquo;s death, Schelling, whose reputation had long since
been eclipsed by that of Hegel, was invited to take up the chair at
Berlin, reputedly because the government of the day had wanted to
counter the influence that Hegelian philosophy had exerted on a
generation of students. Since the early period of his collaboration
with Hegel, Schelling had become more religious in his philosophising
and criticised the rationalism of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy. During
this time of Schelling&rsquo;s tenure at Berlin, important forms of
later critical reaction to Hegelian philosophy developed. Hegel
himself had been a supporter of progressive but non-revolutionary
politics, but his followers divided into factions broadly groupable as
those of the left, right and centre (Toews 1985); from the left, Karl
Marx was to develop his own purported scientific approach to society
and history which appropriated many Hegelian ideas into a
materialistic outlook (Breckman 1998). (Later, especially in reaction
to orthodox Soviet versions of Marxism, many so-called Western
Marxists re-incorporated further Hegelian elements back into their
forms of Marxist philosophy.) Many of Schelling&rsquo;s own criticisms
of Hegel&rsquo;s rationalism found their way into subsequent
existentialist thought, especially via the writings of Kierkegaard,
who had attended Schelling&rsquo;s lectures. Furthermore, the
interpretation Schelling offered of Hegel during these years itself
helped to shape subsequent generations&rsquo; understanding of Hegel,
contributing to the orthodox or traditional understanding of Hegel as
a metaphysical thinker in the pre-Kantian dogmatic sense.</p>

<p>
In academic philosophy, Hegelian idealism had seemed to collapse
dramatically after 1848 and the failure of the revolutionary movements
of that year, but underwent a revival in both Great Britain and the
United States in the last decades of the nineteenth century. In
Britain, where philosophers such as T.H. Green and F.H. Bradley had
developed metaphysical ideas which they related back to Hegel&rsquo;s
thought, Hegel came to be one of the main targets of attack by the
founders of the emerging &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; movement, Bertrand
Russell and G.E. Moore. For Russell, the revolutionary innovations in
logic starting in the last decades of the nineteenth century with the
work of Frege and Peano had destroyed Hegel&rsquo;s metaphysics by
overturning the Aristotelian logic on which, so Russell claimed, it
was based, and in line with this dismissal, Hegel came to be seen
within the analytic movement as an historical figure of little genuine
philosophical interest. To some degree, analogous things could be said
of Hegel&rsquo;s reception from within the twentieth-century
phenomenological tradition that developed in continental Europe, but
although marginalized within such core areas of mainstream academic
philosophy, Hegel nevertheless continued to be a figure of interest
within other philosophical movements such as existentialism and
Marxism. In France, a version of Hegelianism came to influence a
generation of thinkers, including Jean Hyppolite, Jean-Paul Sartre and
the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, largely through the lectures of
Alexandre Koj&egrave;ve. However, a later generation of French
philosophers coming to prominence in the 1960s tended to react against
Hegel in ways analogous to those in which early analytic philosophers
had reacted against the Hegel who had influenced their predecessors.
In Germany, having lapsed in the second half of the nineteenth
century, interest in Hegel was revived at the turn of the twentieth
with the historical work of Wilhelm Dilthey, and important Hegelian
elements were incorporated within the approaches of thinkers of the
Frankfurt School, such as Theodor Adorno, and later J&uuml;rgen
Habermas (Giladi 2021), as well as within the Heidegger-influenced
hermeneutic approach of H.-G. Gadamer (1976a). In Hungary, similar
Hegelian themes were developed by Georg Luk&aacute;cs (1975) and later
thinkers of the Budapest School. In the 1960s the German philosopher
Klaus Hartmann (1972) developed what was termed a
<em>non-metaphysical</em> interpretation of Hegel which, together with
the work of Dieter Henrich, Rolf-Peter Horstmann and others, played an
important role in the revival of interest in Hegel in academic
philosophy in the second half of the century. Within English-speaking
philosophy, the final quarter of the twentieth century saw something
of a revival of serious interest in Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy with
important works appearing such as those by H.S. Harris (1972, 1983,
1997), Charles Taylor (1975), Robert Pippin (1989) and Terry Pinkard
(1994) in North America, and Stephen Houlgate (1991) and Robert Stern
(1990) in Great Britain. By the close of the twentieth century, even
within core logico-metaphysical areas of analytic philosophy, a number
of individuals such as Robert Brandom (2009) and John McDowell (2006)
had started to take Hegel seriously as a significant modern
philosopher, although generally within analytic circles a favorable
reassessment of Hegel has still a long way to go.</p>

<h2 id="HegPhi">2. Hegel&rsquo;s Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s own pithy account of the nature of philosophy given in
the Preface to his <em>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</em>
captures a characteristic tension in his philosophical approach and,
in particular, in his approach to the nature and limits of human
cognition. &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo;, he says there, &ldquo;is its own
time comprehended in thoughts&rdquo; (PR: 21).</p>

<p>
On the one hand we can clearly see in the phrase &ldquo;its own
time&rdquo; the suggestion of an historical or cultural
conditionedness and variability which applies even to the highest form
of human cognition, philosophy itself. The contents of philosophical
knowledge, we might suspect, will come from the historically changing
contents of its cultural context. On the other, there is the hint of
such contents being raised to some higher level, presumably higher
than other levels of cognitive functioning such as those based in
everyday perceptual experience, for example, or those characteristic
of other areas of culture such as art and religion. This higher level
takes the form of conceptually articulated <em>thought</em>, a type of
cognition commonly taken as capable of having purportedly eternal
contents (think of Plato and Frege, for example, who both have the
truths of mathematics in mind). In line with such a conception, Hegel
sometimes referred to the task of philosophy as that of recognising
<em>the concept</em> (<em>der Begriff</em>) in the mere
representations (<em>Vorstellungen</em>) of everyday life.</p>

<p>
This antithetical combination within human cognition of the
temporally-conditioned and the eternal, a combination which reflects a
broader conception of the human being as what Hegel describes
elsewhere as a &ldquo;finite-infinite&rdquo; (SL: 114), has led to
Hegel being regarded in different ways by different types of
philosophical readers. For example, an historically-minded pragmatist
like Richard Rorty, distrustful of all claims or aspirations to the
so-called God&rsquo;s-eye view, could praise Hegel as a philosopher
who had introduced this historically reflective dimension into
philosophy (and set it on the characteristically romantic path which
has predominated in modern continental philosophy) but who had
unfortunately still remained bogged down in the remnants of the
Platonistic idea of the search for ahistorical truths (Rorty 1982).
Those adopting such an approach to Hegel tend to have in mind the
(relatively) young author of the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> and
have tended to dismiss as &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; later and more
systematic works like the <em>Science of Logic</em>. (This opposition
is treated in an illuminating way in Raysmith 2025.) In contrast, the
British Hegelian movement at the end of the nineteenth century tended
to ignore the <em>Phenomenology</em> and the more historicist
dimensions of his thought, and found in Hegel a systematic
metaphysician whose <em>Logic</em> provided the basis for a definitive
philosophical ontology. This latter traditional metaphysical view of
Hegel dominated much Hegel reception for the first half of the
twentieth century, but, as indicated above, it has come to be
challenged from various directions over the last fifty years.</p>

<p>
Before surveying these competing views, however, something needs to be
said about the confusing term &ldquo;idealism&rdquo;, and about the
variety of idealism that is characteristic of Hegel and other German
idealists.</p>

<h3 id="BacIdeUndGerTra">2.1 Background: Idealism as understood in the German tradition</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Idealism&rdquo; is a term that had been used sporadically by
Leibniz and his followers to refer to a type of philosophy that was
opposed to materialism. Thus, for example, Leibniz had contrasted
Plato as an idealist with Epicurus as a materialist. The opposition to
materialism here, together with the fact that in the English-speaking
world the Irish philosopher and clergyman George Berkeley
(1685&ndash;1753) is often taken as a prototypical idealist, has given
rise to the assumption that idealism is necessarily an immaterialist
doctrine. This assumption, however, is mistaken. With the possible
exception of Leibniz, the idealism of the Germans was not committed to
the type of doctrine found in Berkeley according to which immaterial
minds, both infinite (God&rsquo;s) and finite (those of humans), were
the ultimately real entities, with apparently material things to be
understood as reducible to states of such minds&mdash;that is, to
ideas in the sense meant by the British empiricists.</p>

<p>
As Leibniz&rsquo;s use of Plato to exemplify idealism suggests,
idealists in the German tradition tended to hold to the reality or
objectivity of ideas in the Platonic sense, and for Plato, it would
seem, such ideas were not conceived as <em>in</em> any mind at
all&mdash;not even the mind of Plato&rsquo;s god. The type of picture
found in Berkeley was only to be found in certain late antique
Platonists and, in particular, early Christian Platonists like Saint
Augustine, Bishop of Hippo. But especially for the German idealists
like Hegel, Plato&rsquo;s philosophy was understood through the lenses
of more Aristotelian varieties of neo-Platonism, which pictured the
thoughts of a divine mind as immanent in matter, and not as contained
in some purely immaterial or spiritual mind. It thus had features
closer to the more pantheistic picture of divine thought found in
Spinoza, for example, for whom matter and mind were attributes of the
one substance.</p>

<p>
Even for Leibniz, whose later monadological metaphysics was perhaps
closer to Berkeley&rsquo;s immaterialist philosophy, an opposition to
materialism didn&rsquo;t necessarily imply immaterialism. Leibniz had
resisted Descartes&rsquo; postulation of distinct spiritual and
material substances, treating corporeal bodies as inseparable
combinations of form and matter after the manner of Aristotle. The
materialists to whom he was opposed (mechanistic corpuscularists of
his time) conceived of unformed matter as a type of self-subsistent
substance, and it seems to have been that conception to which he was
opposed, at least in some periods of his work, not the reality of
matter <em>per se</em>. Leibniz&rsquo;s combination of Platonic and
Aristotelian notions played a role in the thought of the later
idealists, giving their opposition to materialism its distinctive
character. These anti-immaterialist features of the idealism of the
Germans became more prominent in the post-Kantian period as they moved
progressively away from the more subjectivistic features of
Leibniz&rsquo;s thought (Beiser 2002). For further discussions see

<h3 id="TraMetVieHegPhi">2.2 The traditional metaphysical view of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy</h3>

<p>
Given the understanding of Hegel that predominated at the time of the
birth of analytic philosophy, together with the fact that early
analytic philosophers were rebelling precisely against Hegelianism so
understood, the interpretation of Hegel encountered in discussions
within analytic philosophy is often that of the late nineteenth
century. In this picture, Hegel is seen as offering a
metaphysico-religious view of God <em>qua</em> Absolute Spirit, as the
ultimate reality that we can come to know through pure thought
processes alone. In short, Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy is treated as
exemplifying the type of pre-critical or dogmatic metaphysics against
which Kant had reacted in his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, and as
a return to a more religiously driven conception of philosophy to
which Kant had been opposed.</p>

<p>
There is much that can be found in Hegel&rsquo;s writings that seems
to support this view. In his lectures during his Berlin period one
comes across claims such as the one that philosophy &ldquo;has no
other object but God and so is essentially rational theology&rdquo;
(Aes I: 101). Indeed, Hegel often seems to invoke imagery consistent
with the types of neo-Platonic conceptions of the universe that had
been common within Christian mysticism, especially in the German
states, in the early modern period. The peculiarity of Hegel&rsquo;s
form of idealism, on this account, lies in his idea that the mind of
God becomes actual only via its particularization in the minds of
&ldquo;his&rdquo; finite material creatures. Thus, in our
consciousness of God, we somehow serve to realize his own
self-consciousness, and, thereby, his own perfection. In
English-language interpretations, such a picture is effectively found
in the work of Charles Taylor (1975), Michael Rosen (1984), and
Frederick Beiser (2005), for example. With its dark mystical roots,
and its overtly religious content, it is hardly surprising that the
philosophy of Hegel so understood has rarely been regarded as a live
option within the largely secular and scientific conceptions of
philosophy that have been dominant in the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries.</p>

<p>
An important consequence of Hegel&rsquo;s metaphysics, so understood,
concerns history and the idea of historical development or progress,
and it is as an advocate of a conception of the logically-necessitated
teleological course of history that Hegel is most often derided. To
critics, such as Karl Popper in his popular book <em>The Open Society
and its Enemies</em> (1945), Hegel had not only advocated a disastrous
political conception of the state and the relation of its citizens to
it, a conception prefiguring twentieth-century totalitarianism, but he
had also tried to underpin such advocacy with dubious
theologico-logico-metaphysical speculations. With his idea of the
development of spirit in history, Hegel is seen as literalising a way
of talking about different cultures in terms of their spirits, of
constructing a developmental sequence of epochs typical of
nineteenth-century ideas of linear historical progress, and then
enveloping this story of human progress in terms of one about the
developing self-consciousness of the cosmos-God itself.</p>

<p>
As the bottom line of such an account concerned the evolution of
states of a mind (God&rsquo;s), such an account is clearly an idealist
one, but not in the sense, say, of Berkeley. The pantheistic legacy
inherited by Hegel meant that he had no problem in considering an
objective outer world beyond any particular subjective mind. But this
objective world itself had to be understood as conceptually informed:
it was <em>objectified</em> spirit. Thus in contrast to Berkeleian
subjective idealism it became common to talk of Hegel as incorporating
the objective idealism of views, especially common among German
historians, in which social life and thought were understood in terms
of the conceptual or spiritual structures that informed them. But in
contrast to both forms of idealism, Hegel, according to this reading,
postulated a form of <em>absolute</em> idealism by including both
subjective life and the objective cultural practices on which
subjective life depended within the dynamics of the development of the
self-consciousness and self-actualisation of God, the Absolute
Spirit.</p>

<p>
Despite this seemingly dominant theological theme, Hegel was still
seen by many as an important precursor of other more
characteristically secular strands of modern thought such as
existentialism and Marxist materialism. Existentialists were thought
of as taking the idea of the finitude and historical and cultural
dependence of individual subjects from Hegel, and as leaving out all
pretensions to the Absolute, while Marxists were thought of as taking
the historical dynamics of the Hegelian picture but reinterpreting
this in materialist rather than idealist categories. As for
understanding Hegel himself, the traditional metaphysical view
remained the dominant interpretative approach of Hegel scholars
throughout much of the twentieth century. In the last quarter of the
century, however, it came to be vigorously questioned, with a variety
of interpreters putting forward very different accounts of the basic
nature of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophical project. While a number of
interpretations of Hegel have emerged during this period in an effort
to acquit him of implausible metaphysico-theological views, one
prominent tendency has been to stress the continuity of his ideas with
the &ldquo;critical philosophy&rdquo; of Immanuel Kant.</p>

<h3 id="PosKanSomCalNonMetVieHeg">2.3 The post-Kantian (sometimes called the non-metaphysical) view of Hegel</h3>

<p>
Least controversially, it is often claimed that either particular
works, such as the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>, or particular
areas of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy, especially his ethical and
political philosophy (e.g., Wood 1990), can be understood as standing
independently of an unacceptable metaphysical system of the type
sketched above. Across his writings Hegel clearly touched on a huge
array of issues and many readers have treated his philosophical takes
on particular issues as worthy of serious consideration and capable of
being developed independently of any overarching logic or system.
Going beyond such approaches, however, starting in the decades after
the Second World War, an increasing number of Hegel interpreters came
to defend Hegel&rsquo;s more systematically enframing approach,
suggesting that the traditional picture of metaphysical spirit monism
had failed to capture the innovative nature of Hegel&rsquo;s
approach.</p>

<p>
An early defence of Hegel in this mode had been John N.
Findlay&rsquo;s introductory monograph (Findlay 1958), apparently
written as a riposte to Karl Popper&rsquo;s widely read condemnation
of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy as having informed twentieth-century
totalitarianism (Popper 1945). To this end, Findlay aligned Hegel with
recent philosophical movements, especially Wittgenstein&rsquo;s later
philosophy. A few decades later, suggestions of a not-dissimilar
reinterpretative approach, this time linking Hegel to the pragmatist
turn in philosophy, would be made by Richard Rorty (e.g., Rorty
1982).</p>

<p>
Loosely associated with Rorty&rsquo;s pragmatist or non-realist
construal of Hegel was the systematic reconstruction of Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy as an attempt to <q>complete</q> Kant&rsquo;s critique of
traditional metaphysics, as pursued from the late 1980s by North
American Hegel scholars Robert Pippin (1989, 2008, 2019) and Terry
Pinkard (1994, 2000, 2012, 2017a). In Pippin&rsquo;s influential
account, Hegel had transformed philosophy by deindividualizing and
historicizing Kant&rsquo;s idea of freedom as self-determination.
While Kant had regarded freedom as an abstract universal capacity of
all rational beings, Hegel pictured it as implicit within forms of
social life that had emerged in modernity and that had prioritized
account-giving and justification as informing action. Both Pippin and
Pinkard alluded to the approach of the pragmatist philosopher Wilfrid
Sellars who had socialized Kant&rsquo;s idea of the spontaneity of
reason in terms of Wittgensteinian <q>language-games</q> of the
asking-for and giving of reasons (Sellars 2007, chs 1&ndash;4), and
similar but more explicitly <q>analytic</q> readings of Hegel would
emerge in the work of Robert Brandom (2009, 2019) and John McDowell
(2006, 2018), extending Sellars&rsquo;s interpretation of Kant to
Hegel. Although not the only views put forward to construe
Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy as a development and completion of that of
Kant, this broad family of approaches would be come to be described as
the <q>post-Kantian</q> view. (An earlier designation as the
<q>non-metaphysical</q> view opposing the <em>traditional</em>
metaphysical view came to be dropped for the unwanted suggestion that
Hegel espoused <em>no</em> metaphysics.)</p>

<h3 id="RevMetReaPosKanVieHeg">2.4 The revised metaphysical reaction to the post-Kantian view of Hegel</h3>

<p>
Not surprisingly, the strong post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel was
soon subjected to criticism by defenders of the more traditional
approach, who argued against the plausibility of attempting to
rehabilitate Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy by divesting it of its central
and purportedly unacceptable metaphysical claims (see, for example,
Beiser 2005 and Horstmann 2006). Proponents of the post-Kantian view,
it was commonly said, were portrayed as projecting onto Hegel views a
contemporary philosopher would like to find there rather than what is
actually to be found. However, the post-Kantian interpretation also
came to be criticized by a variety of interpreters who, while
recognizing the influence of Kant&rsquo;s critical philosophy on
Hegel, emphasized Hegel&rsquo;s critique of Kant and affirmed the
irreducible role played by <q>metaphysics</q> in Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy. Nevertheless, many of these interpreters shared the
post-Kantians&rsquo; attempts to separate Hegel&rsquo;s views from the
extravagant views traditionally ascribed to him, and generally argued
for the broad acceptability of Hegel&rsquo;s views from the
perspective of contemporary approaches to philosophy. Among these
critics one can find interpreters attributing to Hegel some type of
<em>conceptual realism</em>, sometimes appealing to contemporary
analytic metaphysics for the legitimacy of metaphysics conceived as
inquiry into the fundamental features or structures of the world
itself. Interpreters advancing some version of the revised
metaphysical view include Stephen Houlgate (2005, 2022), Robert Stern
(2002, 2009), Kenneth Westphal (2003), James Kreines (2006, 2008,
2015), Karen Ng (2020), and Jacob McNulty (2023).</p>

<p>
This unfolding dialectic between post-Kantian interpreters and their
non-traditional metaphysical critics has provided a fertile space
within which the contemporary relevance of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy
has been explored and opposed interpretations sharpened. For example,
Robert Pippin has replied to early critics by elaborating on the
senses in which the philosophical content of the post-Kantian Hegel
might or might not be described as metaphysical, distancing his
earlier interpretation from the label &ldquo;non-metaphysical&rdquo;
(Pippin 1989, 2019). From the other side, Stephen Houlgate for example
has argued for a view of Hegel as taking on board Kant&rsquo;s
critique of earlier <em>rationalist</em> metaphysical positions
without abandoning metaphysics <em>per se</em>. (For convenience I
will take Pippin and Houlgate here as examples of such opposing points
of view although they far from exhaust the field of such views.)</p>

<p>
In his 2019 monograph devoted to Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Science of
Logic</em>, Pippin stresses that while Hegel has a metaphysics, it is
a metaphysics <q>in a new sense</q> (Pippin 2019, 5). While
Hegel&rsquo;s logic is a <q>science of pure thinking</q>, there is,
nevertheless, an <q>identity (a &lsquo;speculative identity&rsquo; to
be sure) between the forms of pure thinking and the forms of being</q>
(2019, 6), that is, between logic and ontology. Hegel&rsquo;s
fundamental link to Kant had been his (Sellarsian) idea that
<q>thinking is discursive; to think what is the case is to assert that
it is (the basic unit of intelligibility in Hegel&rsquo;s account is
the judgment; assertion its linguistic manifestation)</q> (2019, 14).
However, Hegel was critical of those residual <em>empiricist</em>
elements within Kant in which sensory intuition played the role of
providing a definitive and unrevisable content for logically
structured judgment forms&mdash;elements criticised by Sellars with
the notion of the <q>myth of the given</q> (Sellars 1997). Hegel was a
fallibilist for whom accepted assertions would be <q>always open to
challenge and interrogation</q> (Pippin 2019, 14). With this
ineliminable role given to fallible judgment, <q>metaphysics</q>, in
the new Hegelian sense, thus had become redefined:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hegelian philosophy has no distinct doctrine of its own; its content
is the right understanding of past attempts at account-giving in their
limitations and interconnection. (Pippin 2019, 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, Hegel&rsquo;s logic traces the endeavour of thought to know
itself by reflecting <em>on itself</em> rather than anything external
to it, but <q>in knowing itself, what pure thought knows is the
possibility of intelligibility, the knowability of anything that
is</q>. And yet,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the intelligibility of anything is just what it is to be that thing,
the answer to the <q>what is it</q> (<em>ti esti</em>) question
definitive of metaphysics since Aristotle. (Pippin 2019, 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For his part, Houlgate is critical of Pippin&rsquo;s portrayal of
thought&rsquo;s systematic production of its own categorical structure
in the <em>Science of Logic</em> as well as his conception of the
relation of logic to ontology, <q>being</q>. Like Pippin, Houlgate
treats Hegel&rsquo;s unfolding of the categories of pure thought as a
development of Kant&rsquo;s <q>table of categories</q> in the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, but while Kant drew upon existing
concepts of the logical structure of judgment, Hegel demanded a
rigorous deduction of the categories from a presuppositionless
starting point. With this Houlgate rejects Pippin&rsquo;s insistence
on the discursive nature of thought and the associated rendering of
the relation of thought and being. Hegel, he asserts, does not start
his logic with the idea of thought&rsquo;s directedness to something
else, being; he rather starts with the idea of thought itself <em>as
pure being</em> (Houlgate 2022, vol. 1, 130). Pippin misses the idea
of logic as the <q>ontological study of being</q> in a direct sense,
rather than simply a higher-level account of objects of our
judgments.</p>

<p>
I suggest that in such debates we are witnessing something of a shift
in philosophical terrain to the level of <q>metaphilosophy</q> or the
<q>philosophy of philosophy</q>, as argued in a recent collection of
essays (Illetterati and Miolli 2022). That is, the debate no longer
remains simply at any first-order level of opposed
contents&mdash;materialism, immaterialism, spiritualism, etc.. Rather,
it has shifted to the level of a debate about the nature of philosophy
as a theoretical or <q>scientific</q> (in Hegel&rsquo;s sense) pursuit
and its place within the broader field of human inquiry. Such a
reconfiguration of the terrain of debate has, I suggest, broadened the
context within which Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy has come to be
considered and assessed from a contemporary perspective, drawing it
into areas pursued in both recent analytic philosophy or
<q>post-analytic</q> philosophy and phenomenological and
post-phenomenological forms of continental philosophy.</p>

<p>
Such repositioning of Hegel interpretations within the framework of
contemporary philosophy has, for example, further allowed
re-engagement with Hegel&rsquo;s logic from the perspective of
post-Russellian, or <q>post-classical</q> conceptions of logic as
developed over the last hundred years. A consideration of
Hegel&rsquo;s <q>dialectical</q> logic in the light of the emergence
of post-Russellian logical movements had been raised by John Findlay
in the 1960s (Findlay 1963), and more recently Graham Priest has
pursued an interpretation of Hegel&rsquo;s logic as a variety of
<q>paraconsistent</q> logic&mdash;a dialetheic logic which permits the
existence of true contradictions (e.g., Priest 1989/90). In turn,
Priest&rsquo;s dialetheism has been used to shed light on
Hegel&rsquo;s peculiar metaphysics by Gregory Moss (Moss 2020). From a
position closer to Findlay&rsquo;s, Redding has raised parallels
between Hegel&rsquo;s formal logic from Book III of <em>The Science of
Logic</em> and modern intuitionistic logic that emerged as the logic
of L.E.J. Brouwer&rsquo;s non-Russellian approach to mathematics,
notable for its suspension of the Law of Excluded Middle (Redding
2023b). Such a conception of logic, it is argued, is reflected in
Hegel&rsquo;s embrace of an <q>actualist</q> form of modal metaphysics
(Redding 2017a). All in all, it could be said that the somewhat
surprising revival of philosophical interest in the linked logical and
metaphysical doctrines of Hegel as yet shows no signs of abating.</p>

<h2 id="HegPubWor">3. Hegel&rsquo;s Published Works</h2>

<p>
We may think of there being five different types of work that make up
Hegel&rsquo;s published corpus. First, there are Hegel&rsquo;s two
major stand-alone books written for publication, already
mentioned&mdash;<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (1807) and
<em>Science of Logic</em> (1812&ndash;18). In the next category are
works that were published at the time as handbooks for use in student
teaching, such as the <em>Encyclopaedia of Philosophical
Sciences</em>, first published in 1817 while he was teaching at
Heidelberg and subsequently revised and republished in 1827 and again
in 1830, and <em>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</em>, effectively
an expansion of a section of the <em>Encyclopaedia</em> and published
in 1820 after his move to Berlin. (Transcripts of his earlier lectures
on this topic delivered in Heidelberg have also since been published.)
Along with the <em>Encyclopaedia</em> and the <em>Philosophy of
Right</em> might be added similar teaching-related writings from the
Jena period, prepared as lectures but only published as such much
later. The third major category is formed by posthumously published
lecture courses from his time at the University of Berlin, which,
after Hegel&rsquo;s death, were assembled by editors from his lecture
notes and from student transcripts of the lectures as
delivered&mdash;these include his lectures on the <em>Philosophy of
Nature</em>, <em>Philosophy of Spirit, Philosophy of History</em>,
<em>Aesthetics</em>, <em>Philosophy of Religion</em>, and <em>History
of Philosophy</em>. Next might be considered various miscellaneous
essays and short works published during his career, and finally we can
count Hegel&rsquo;s early works, written in the period between his
student years at T&uuml;bingen and his move to Jena, and predominantly
on religious and political themes. Here we will restrict the
discussion to the first three categories.</p>

<h3 id="Boo">3.1 Books</h3>

<h4 id="PheSpi">3.1.1 <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em></h4>

<p>
The term &ldquo;phenomenology&rdquo; had been coined by the Swiss
mathematician (and correspondent of Immanuel Kant) J.H. Lambert
(1728&ndash;1777) in his <em>The New Organon</em> of 1764, and in a
letter to Lambert, sent to accompany a copy of his Inaugural
Dissertation (1770), Kant had proposed his own project of a
&ldquo;general phenomenology&rdquo; as a necessary propaedeutic
presupposed by the science of metaphysics. Such a phenomenology was
meant to determine the &ldquo;validity and limitations&rdquo; of what
he called the &ldquo;principles of sensibility&rdquo;, principles he
had (he thought) shown in the accompanying work to be importantly
different to those of conceptual thought. The term clearly suited Kant
as he had distinguished the phenomena known through the faculty of
sensibility from the noumena known purely conceptually. This
envisioned phenomenology seems to coincide roughly with what he was to
eventually describe as a <em>critique of pure reason</em>, although
Kant&rsquo;s thought had gone through important changes by the time
that he came to publish the work of that name (1781, second edition
1787). Perhaps because of this he never again used the term
&ldquo;phenomenology&rdquo; for quite this purpose.</p>

<p>
There is clearly some continuity between Kant&rsquo;s notion and
Hegel&rsquo;s project. In a sense Hegel&rsquo;s phenomenology is a
study of phenomena (although this is not a realm he would contrast
with that of noumena) and Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Phenomenology of
Spirit</em> is likewise to be regarded as a type of propaedeutic to
philosophy rather than an exercise in or work of philosophy. It is
meant to function as an induction or education of the reader to the
standpoint of purely conceptual thought from which philosophy can be
done. As such, its structure has been compared to that of a
<em>Bildungsroman</em> charting the psychological development of a
protagonist, here abstractly conceived as the bearer of an evolving
series of so-called shapes of consciousness, or as the inhabitant of a
series of successive phenomenal worlds, whose progress and set-backs
are followed by the reader and learnt from. Or at least this is how
the work sets out: in the later sections the earlier series of shapes
of consciousness becomes replaced with what seem more like
configurations of human <em>social life</em>, and the work comes to
look more like an account of interlinked forms of social existence and
thought within which participants in such forms of social life
conceive of themselves and the world. Hegel constructs a series of
such shapes that maps onto the history of western European
civilization from the Greeks to his own time.</p>

<p>
The fact that this progression ends in the attainment of what Hegel
refers to as Absolute Knowing, the standpoint from which real
philosophy gets done, seems to support the traditionalist reading in
which a triumphalist narrative of the growth of western civilization
is combined with the theological interpretation of God&rsquo;s
self-manifestation and self-comprehension. When Kant had broached the
idea of a phenomenological propaedeutic to Lambert, he himself had
still believed in the project of a purely conceptual metaphysics
achievable by the use of the regressive or analytic method, but this
project conceived as an exercise in theoretical reason was just what
Kant in his later critical philosophy had come to disavow. Traditional
readers of Hegel thus see the <em>Phenomenology</em>&rsquo;s
<em>telos</em> as attesting to Hegel&rsquo;s pre-Kantian (that is,
pre-critical) outlook, and his embrace of the metaphysical project
that Kant famously came to dismiss as illusory. Supporters of the
post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel obviously interpret this work and
its <em>telos</em> differently. For example, it has been argued (e.g.,
Pinkard 1994) that what this history tracks is the development of a
type of social existence which enables a unique form of rationality,
in that in such a society all dogmatic bases of thought have been
gradually replaced by a system in which all claims become open to
rational self-correction, by becoming exposed to demands for
conceptually-articulated justifications, something like those found in
Sellarsian <q>language games</q>.</p>

<p>
Something of Hegel&rsquo;s phenomenological method may be conveyed by
the first few chapters, which are perhaps among its more
conventionally philosophical parts. Chapters 1 to 3 effectively follow
a developmental series of distinct shapes of
consciousness&mdash;jointly epistemological and ontological attitudes
articulated by criteria which are, regarded from one direction,
criteria for certain <em>knowledge</em>, and from the other, criteria
for the nature of the <em>objects</em> of such knowledge. In chapter
1, the attitude of <em>Sense-certainty</em> takes immediately given
perceptual simples&mdash;playing the same sort of role as the
so-called sense-data of early twentieth-century analytic epistemology,
for example, with which a subject is purportedly acquainted as bare
<em>this</em>es&mdash;as the fundamental objects known. By following
this form of consciousness&rsquo;s attempts to make these implicit
criteria explicit, we are meant to appreciate that any such contents,
even the apparently most immediate ones, are in fact grasped
conceptually, and so, in Hegel&rsquo;s terminology, their reception is
actually mediated by the concepts with which they are grasped. Hegel
is clear that these contents are not merely qualitative simples that
are immediately <em>apprehended</em>, but <em>comprehended</em>
instances of the conceptual determination of singularity
(<em>Einzelheit</em>, Phen: &sect;91). Such a simple <em>this</em>,
then, can also be understood as an instance of what the Medievals
discussed as <em>thisness</em>&mdash;a general property of an
individual thing&rsquo;s being identical to itself. One might compare
Hegel&rsquo;s point here to that expressed by Kant in his well known
claim from the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (A51/B75) that without
general concepts, intuitions (singular (<em>einzeln</em>) purportedly
immediate mental representations) are blind. However, Hegel seems to
want to make this point without relying on Kant&rsquo;s formal
distinction between concepts and intuitions as different species of
representation. The idea seems to be that for Hegel, the same content
can play the roles played by both concepts and intuitions in Kant.
(The lessons of this chapter have sometimes been likened to those of
Wilfrid Sellars&rsquo;s famous criticism of the empiricist "myth of
the given" (Sellars 1997).)</p>

<p>
By the end of this chapter our protagonist consciousness (and by
implication, we the audience to this drama) has learnt that the nature
of consciousness cannot be as originally thought: rather than being
immediate and singular, its contents must have some implicit universal
(conceptual) aspect to them. The general truth that was learned about
the apparent qualitative simples in Sense-certainty (that they were
instances of generals) is now explicitly taken as the truth of the
object of Perception (<em>Wahrnehmung</em>&mdash;in German this term
having the connotations of taking (<em>nehmen</em>) to be true
(<em>wahr</em>)). In contrast to the purported single object of
Sense-certainty, the object of Perception is taken as instantiating
general properties: it is &ldquo;a thing with many properties&rdquo;
(Phen: &sect;112). But this can be conceived in a variety of ways:
first, as a simple bundle of indifferent qualities (a picture
associated with Plato), or as an underlying substrate in which these
qualities somehow inhere (a picture associated with Aristotle).
Predictably, problems will be revealed in these various different ways
of thinking of the nature of those everyday objects of our
experience.</p>

<p>
As in the case of Sense-certainty, here in the case of Perception, by
following the protagonist consciousness&rsquo;s efforts to make this
implicit criterion explicit, we see how the criterion generates
contradictions that eventually undermine it as a criterion for
certainty. In fact, such collapse into a type of self-generated
skepticism is typical of all the shapes we follow in the work, and
there seems something inherently skeptical about such reflexive
cognitive processes. But this is not the type of skepticism that is
typical of early modern philosophy, such as that used by Descartes in
his attempt to find some foundation of indubitability on which genuine
knowledge can be built (Forster 1989). As is clear from his treatment
of ancient philosophy in the <em>Lectures on the History of
Philosophy</em>, Hegel was attracted to the type of dialectic employed
by Socrates in his efforts to get his interlocutors thinking about
something beyond that given immediately in sensation (LHP II: 51), and
implicit in the ancient form of skepticism that had been employed
after Socrates (LHP II: 344). For Hegel, the ancient skeptics captured
the skeptical moment of thought that is the means by which thought
progresses <em>beyond</em> the particular categories that have given
rise to contradictions. Just as in the way a new shape of thought,
Perception, had been generated from the internal contradictions that
emerged within Sense-certainty, the collapse of any given attitude
will be accompanied by the emergence of some new implicit criterion
that will be the basis of a new emergent attitude. In the case of
Perception, the emergent new shape of consciousness, the
Understanding, explored in Chapter 3, is a shape identified with the
type of scientific cognition that, rather than remaining on the level
of the perceived object, posits underlying forces involved in the
production of the perceptual episode.</p>

<p>
The transition from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4, The Truth of
Self-Certainty, also marks a more general transition from
Consciousness to Self-consciousness. It is in the course of Chapter 4
that we find what is perhaps the most well-known part of the
<em>Phenomenology</em>, the account of the <em>struggle of
recognition</em> in which Hegel examines the inter-subjective
conditions which he sees as necessary for any form of consciousness.
This is a topic that was first made prominent by Alexandre
Koj&egrave;ve (1969), and which has been appealed to in
non-Koj&egrave;vean ways recently by a number of non-traditional
interpreters in order to give quite different accounts of
Hegel&rsquo;s notion of Spirit (Honneth 1995; Ik&auml;heimo and
Laitinen 2011; Pippin 2008; Williams 1992).</p>

<p>
Like Kant, Hegel thinks that one&rsquo;s capacity to be conscious of
some external object as something distinct from oneself requires the
reflexivity of <em>self</em>-consciousness, that is, it requires
one&rsquo;s awareness of oneself as a subject <em>for whom</em>
something distinct, the object, is presented as known (a result
emerging in Chapter 3). Hegel goes beyond Kant, however, and expanding
on an idea found in Fichte, makes this requirement dependent on
one&rsquo;s recognition (or acknowledgment&mdash;<em>Anerkennung</em>)
of <em>other</em> self-conscious subjects as self-conscious subjects
for whom any object of consciousness will be thought as also existing.
One&rsquo;s self-consciousness, in fact, will be dependent on
one&rsquo;s recognition of those others as similarly recognizing
<em>oneself</em> as a self-conscious subject. Such complex patterns of
mutual recognition constituting <em>objective spirit</em> thereby
provide the social matrix within which individual self-consciousnesses
can exist as such. It is in this way that the <em>Phenomenology</em>
can change course, the earlier tracking of shapes of individual
consciousness and self-consciousness effectively coming to be replaced
by the tracking of distinct patterns of mutual recognition between
subjects&mdash;shapes of spirit&mdash;that forms the ground for the
existence of those individual
consciousnesses/self-consciousnesses.</p>

<p>
It is thus that Hegel has effected the transition from a phenomenology
of the individual&rsquo;s subjective mind to one of objective spirit,
thought of as culturally distinct objective patterns of social
interaction to be analysed in terms of the patterns of reciprocal
recognition they embody. (<em>Geist</em> can be translated as either
&ldquo;mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;, but the latter, allowing a
more cultural sense, as in the phrase &ldquo;spirit of the age&rdquo;
(<em>Zeitgeist</em>), seems a more suitable rendering for the title.)
But this is only worked out in the text gradually. We&mdash;the
reading or so-called phenomenological we&mdash;can see how particular
shapes of self-consciousness, such as that of the other-worldly
religious self-consciousness (Unhappy Consciousness) with which
Chapter 4 ends, depend on certain institutionalised forms of mutual
recognition, in this case one involving a priest who mediates between
the self-conscious subject and that subject&rsquo;s God. But we are
seeing this &ldquo;from the outside&rdquo;, as it were: we still have
to learn how actual self-consciousnesses could learn this of
themselves. So we have to see how the protagonist self-consciousness
could achieve this insight. It is to this end that we further trace
the learning path of self-consciousness through the processes of
reason (in Chapter 5) before objective spirit can become the explicit
subject matter of Chapter 6 (Spirit).</p>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s discussion of spirit starts from what he calls
<em>Sittlichkeit</em> (translated as &ldquo;ethical order&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ethical substance&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Sittlichkeit</em> being a
nominalization from the adjectival (or adverbial) form
<em>sittlich</em>, &ldquo;customary&rdquo;, from the stem
<em>Sitte</em>, &ldquo;custom&rdquo; or &ldquo;convention&rdquo;).
Thus Hegel might be seen as adopting the viewpoint that since social
life is ordered by customs, we can approach the lives of those living
in it in terms of the patterns of those customs or conventions
themselves&mdash;the conventional practices, as it were, constituting
specific, shareable <em>forms of life</em> made actual in the lives of
particular individuals who had in turn internalized such general
patterns in the process of acculturation. It is not surprising then
that his account of spirit here starts with a discussion of religious
and civic law. Undoubtedly it is Hegel&rsquo;s tendency to nominalise
such abstract concepts in his attempt to capture the concrete nature
of such patterns of conventional life, together with the tendency to
then personify them (as in talking about spirit <em>becoming</em>
self-conscious), that lends plausibility to the traditionalist
understanding of Hegel. But for non-traditionalists it is not obvious
that Hegel, in employing such phrases, is in any way committed to any
metaphysical supra-individual conscious being or beings. To take an
example, in the second section of the chapter on spirit, Hegel
discusses human culture as the &ldquo;world of self-alienated
spirit&rdquo;. The idea seems to be that humans in society not only
interact, but that they collectively create relatively enduring
cultural products (repeatable stories, stageable dramas, and so forth)
within which members of that society can recognise patterns of their
own communal life as so reflected. We might find intelligible the
metaphor that such products &ldquo;hold up a mirror to society&rdquo;
within which &ldquo;the society can regard itself&rdquo;, without
thinking we are thereby committed to some supra-individual unitary
mind achieving self-consciousness. Furthermore, such cultural products
themselves provide conditions allowing individuals to adopt particular
cognitive attitudes by appropriating their resources. Thus, for
example, the capacity to adopt the type of objective viewpoint
demanded by Kantian morality (discussed in the final section of the
Spirit chapter)&mdash;the capacity to see things, as it were, from a
detached or universal point of view&mdash;might be enabled by engaging
with spirit&rsquo;s &ldquo;alienations&rdquo; such as the myths and
rituals of a religion professing a universal scope.</p>

<p>
We might think that if Kant had written Hegel&rsquo;s
<em>Phenomenology</em> he would have ended it at Chapter 6 with the
modern moral subject as the <em>telos</em> of the story. For Kant, the
practical knowledge of morality, orienting one within the noumenal
world, exceeds the scope of theoretical knowledge, which had been
limited to phenomena. Hegel, however, thought that philosophy had to
unify theoretical and practical knowledge, and so the
<em>Phenomenology</em> has further to go. Again, this is seen
differently by traditionalists and revisionists. For traditionalists,
Chapters 7, Religion, and 8, Absolute Knowing, testify to
Hegel&rsquo;s disregard for Kant&rsquo;s critical limitation of
theoretical knowledge to empirical experience. Post-Kantians, on the
other hand, tend to see Hegel as furthering the Kantian critique into
the very coherence of a conception of an <em>in-itself</em> reality
that is beyond the limits of our theoretical (but not practical)
cognition. Rather than understand absolute knowing as the achievement
of some ultimate God&rsquo;s-eye view of everything, the philosophical
analogue to the connection with God sought in religion, post-Kantian
revisionists see it as the accession to a mode of self-critical
thought that has finally abandoned all non-questionable mythical
givens, and which will only countenance reason-giving argument as
justification. However we understand this, absolute knowing is the
standpoint to which Hegel has hoped to bring the reader in this
complex work. This is the standpoint of science, the standpoint from
which philosophy proper commences, and it commences in Hegel&rsquo;s
next book, the <em>Science of Logic</em>.</p>

<h4 id="SciLog">3.1.2 <em>Science of Logic</em></h4>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Science of Logic</em> is divided into three books,
dealing with the topics of <em>being</em>, <em>essence</em>, and
<em>the concept</em>, which appeared in 1812, 1813, and 1816
respectively. For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century it was not
received with the enthusiasm that often marked the reception of
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>. First, as a work of <em>logic</em>
most have regarded it as radically outdated and relying on an
Aristotelian approach that was definitively surpassed in the later
nineteenth century&mdash;a view promoted especially by Bertrand
Russell in the early years of the twentieth. Thus many readers
sympathetic to particular doctrines in Hegel have attempted, contrary
to Hegel&rsquo;s insistence, to quarantine his philosophical approach
to particular areas from his logic. Recently, this skepticism has
started to change.</p>

<p>
Some advocate that the <em>Science of Logic</em> be read as a category
theory that simultaneously represents structures of being and thought
(Houlgate 2005, 2022), and so as having very little to do with what
has traditionally been known as logic. Others argue that in contrast
to the project of formal (or general) logic, it is best understood as
a version of what Kant had called &ldquo;transcendental logic&rdquo;
(di Giovanni 2010). In this sense it should thereby be thought of as a
successor to Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;transcendental deduction of the
categories&rdquo; in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, in which
Kant attempted to derive a list of those non-empirical concepts, the
<em>categories</em>, which he believed to be presupposed by all
empirical judgments made by finite, discursive knowers like ourselves
(Pippin 2019). In short, taking the logic as a category theory opens
up two general lines of interpretation: should the categories be
understood as primarily <em>ontological</em> categories, as found in
Aristotle, or as primarily categories revealing the necessary
structure of <em>thought</em>, as in Kant? Those, such as the
advocates of the revised metaphysical interpretation, who interpret
Hegel as basically a metaphysician, typically stress the former, while
post-Kantian interpreters typically stress the latter.</p>

<p>
A glance at the table of contents of the <em>Science of Logic</em>
reveals the same triadic structuring among the categories or thought
determinations discussed that has been noted among the shapes of
consciousness in the <em>Phenomenology</em>. At the highest level of
its branching structure there are the three books devoted to the
doctrines of being, essence, and concept, while in turn, each book has
three sections, each section containing three chapters, and so on. In
general, each of these individual nodes deals with some particular
category. In fact, Hegel&rsquo;s categorial triads appear to repeat
Kant&rsquo;s own triadic way of articulating the categories in the
Table of Categories (<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>: A80/B106), in
which the third term in the triad in some way integrates the first
two. (In Hegel&rsquo;s terminology, he would say that the first two
were <em>sublated</em> (<em>aufgehoben</em>, with a sense of being
negated but still preserved) in the third&mdash;while the first two
are negated by the third, they continue to work within the context
defined by it.) Hegel&rsquo;s later treatment of the syllogism in Book
III, in which he follows Aristotle&rsquo;s own three-termed schematism
of the syllogistic structure, repeats this triadic structure, as does
his ultimate analysis of its component concepts as the moments of
universality, particularity, and singularity.</p>

<p>
Reading into the first chapter of Book I, Being, it is quickly seen
that the transitions of the <em>Logic</em> broadly repeat those of the
first chapters of the <em>Phenomenology</em>, now, however, as between
the categories themselves rather than between conceptions of the
respective objects of conscious experience. Thus <em>being</em> is the
thought determination with which the work commences because it at
first seems to be the most immediate, fundamental determination that
characterises any possible thought content at all. (In contrast,
<em>being</em> in the <em>Phenomenology</em>&rsquo;s Sense-certainty
chapter was described as the known <em>truth</em> of the purported
immediate sensory given&mdash;the category that it was discovered to
instantiate.) Whatever thought is about, that topic must in some sense
exist. Like those purported simple sensory givens with which the
<em>Phenomenology</em> starts, the category <em>being</em> looks to
have no internal structure or constituents, but again in a parallel to
the <em>Phenomenology</em>, it is the effort of thought to make this
category explicit that both undermines it and brings about new ones.
<em>Being</em> seems to be both immediate and simple, but it will show
itself to be, in fact, something only in opposition to something else,
<em>nothing</em>. The point seems to be that while the categories
<em>being</em> and <em>nothing</em> seem both absolutely distinct and
opposed, on reflection (and following Leibniz&rsquo;s principle of the
identity of indiscernibles) they appear identical as no criterion can
be invoked which differentiates them. The only way out of this paradox
is to posit a third category within which they can coexist as sublated
(<em>aufgehoben</em>) moments. This category is <em>becoming</em>,
which saves thinking from paralysis because it accommodates both
concepts, since becoming contains both being and nothing in the sense
that when something becomes it passes, as it were, from nothingness to
being. But these contents cannot be understood apart from their
contributions to the overarching category: this is what it is to be
sublated (<em>aufgehoben</em>) within the new category.</p>

<p>
In general this is how the <em>Logic</em> proceeds: seeking its most
basic and universal determination, thought posits a category to be
reflected upon, finds then that this collapses due to a contradiction
generated, like that generated by the category <em>being</em>, and so
then seeks a further category with which to make retrospective senses
of those contradictory categories. However, in turn the new category
will generate some further contradictory negation and again the demand
will arise for a further concept that can reconcile these opposed
concepts by incorporating them as moments.</p>

<p>
The method Hegel employs here, <em>determinate negation</em>, is often
compared with Spinoza&rsquo;s principle that &ldquo;all determination
is negation&rdquo;, but while Hegel&rsquo;s thought is related to
Spinoza&rsquo;s, it cannot be identified with or reduced to it.
Spinoza&rsquo;s top-down determination starts with a single category
(in his case, <em>divine substance</em>) that is then progressively
divided by the application of concepts&mdash;the model being
Plato&rsquo;s method of division in which a <em>genus</em> concept is
divided into particular <em>species</em> by the presence or absence of
some differentiating property. From Hegel&rsquo;s point of view,
however, this cannot capture individuals as other than parts of that
greater whole&mdash;a metaphysical picture in relation to Spinoza he
refers to as <em>acosmism</em>. So Hegel will balance this type of
determination by negation, with a different type of negation modeled
on that which holds between incompatible propertie<em>s</em> of some
object (for example, red and blue as incompatible colors) and that is
reflected in the <em>term negation</em> of Aristotle&rsquo;s logic.
This allows Hegel to go beyond the determination of something as
particular (suggesting the part-whole relation) to a more robust sense
of singularity (<em>Einzelheit)</em>&mdash;the sense of the pure
thisness seen initially in the <em>Phenomenology</em>&rsquo;s
Sense-certainty chapter, the truth of which was then shown to be
Aristotle&rsquo;s idea of an individual thing&rsquo;s substantial form
in the Perception chapter. It is in terms of this category that we can
think, along with Aristotle, of a thing having an underlying substrate
within which properties inhere and which, unlike the properties
themselves, cannot be thought in general terms, but only in terms of
the category of <em>singularity</em>. And yet this will encounter a
problem for the determinacy of this underlying substrate&mdash;it will
have to find determining contrasts that allow <em>it</em> to be
determinately conceived. (In Book III of the <em>Logic</em> we will
learn that the category of singularity will rely on particularity just
as particularity has been shown to rely on singularity. Singular
substrates or &ldquo;essences&rdquo; can only be known in relation to
the general properties that constitute their appearances.)</p>

<p>
Attempting to unravel the intricacies of the patterns of dependence
between such categories would be the task of this mammoth work, but
here a general point might be made. If Hegel&rsquo;s thought here is
considered to be, like Spinoza&rsquo;s, holistic, it is only so at a
higher level of abstraction, such that these determinations of
<em>singularity</em>, <em>particularity</em> and <em>universality</em>
cannot themselves be understood in isolation from each other but only
via their complex interactions. Hegel only explicitly explores the
details of the interactions of these determinations of conceptuality
in his discussion of judgments and syllogisms in Book III, The
Doctrine of Concept, suggesting that concerns of logic as
traditionally conceived are not as irrelevant to the <em>Science of
Logic</em> as often thought. However, the general point separating his
approach from that of Spinoza clearly emerges earlier on. Determinate
negation is not Spinoza&rsquo;s principle as Spinoza&rsquo;s
presupposes a whole that <em>precedes</em> its parts, and that all
negations are negations of something that is primitively positive. In
contrast, Hegel&rsquo;s negations will be negations of determinations
that are already to be conceived as themselves negations.</p>

<p>
The other basic methodological principle of the <em>Logic</em> will be
that this categorical infrastructure of thought is able to be unpacked
using only the resources available to thought itself: the capacity of
thought to make its contents determinate (in a way somewhat like what
Leibniz had thought of as making clear but confused ideas clear and
distinct), and its capacity to be consistent and avoid contradiction.
Again, for some readers, this makes Hegel&rsquo;s logic akin to
Kant&rsquo;s transcendental logic which, rather than treating the pure
form of thought abstracted from all content, treats thought as already
possessing a certain type of self-generated content (in Kant&rsquo;s
terminology, &ldquo;transcendental content&rdquo;) that is presupposed
by the subsequent acquisition of all <em>empirical</em> content. But
if Hegel&rsquo;s logic is akin to Kant&rsquo;s transcendental logic,
it has clear differences from it as well. For Kant, transcendental
logic was the logic governing the thought of finite thinkers like
ourselves, whose cognition was constrained by the necessity of
applying general discursive concepts to the singular contents given in
sensory intuitions, and he contrasted this with the thought of a type
of thinker not so constrained&mdash;God&mdash;a thinker whose thought
could directly grasp the world in a type of intellectual intuition.
While opinions divide as to how Hegel&rsquo;s approach to logic
relates to that of Kant, it is important to grasp that for Hegel logic
is not simply a science of the form of our thoughts. It is also a
science of actual <em>content</em> as well, and as such has an
ontological dimension.</p>

<p>
The thought determinations of Book I lead eventually into those of
Book II, The Doctrine of Essence. Naturally the logical structures and
processes implicit in essence-thinking are more developed than those
of being-thinking. Crucially, the contrasting pair <em>essence</em>
and <em>appearance</em> of Essence-logic allow the thought of some
underlying reality that manifests itself through a different overlying
appearance, in the way that the forces posited by the operations of
the Understanding (explored in the <em>Phenomenology</em>&rsquo;s
Chapter 3) are grasped through the appearances they explain. In
contrast, the categories of Being-logic seem to govern thought
processes that are restricted to qualitative properties of objects and
their quantitative relations. But distinction between <em>essence</em>
and <em>appearance</em> must itself instantiate the relation of
determinate negation, and the metaphysical tendency to think of
reality as made up of some underlying substrates in contrast to the
superficial appearances will itself come to grief with the discovery
that the notion of an essence is only meaningful in virtue of the
appearance that it is meant to explain away. (In terms of the ultimate
<em>conceptual</em> categories of singularity, particularity and
universality, this discovery would be equivalent to grasping the idea
that the singularity of the underlying, non-perceivable substrate or
substantial form is meaningful only in relation to something that can
bear the particular qualities that constitute its worldly appearance.)
For Hegel it is the complex modern, but pre-Kantian, versions of
substance metaphysics, like those of Spinoza and Leibniz, that bring
out in the most developed way the inherently contradictory nature of
this form of thought.</p>

<p>
Book III, The Doctrine of Concept, effects a shift from the Objective
Logic of Books I and II, to Subjective Logic, and metaphysically
coincides with a shift to the modern subject-based category theory of
Kant. Just as Kantian philosophy is founded on a conception of
objectivity secured by conceptual coherence, Concept-logic commences
with the concept of <em>concept</em> itself, with its moments of
singularity, particularity and universality. While in the two books of
objective logic the movement had been between particular concepts,
<em>being</em>, <em>nothing</em>, <em>becoming</em> etc., in the
subjective logic the conceptual relations are grasped at a meta-level,
such that the concept <em>concept</em> treated in Chapter 1 of section
1 (Subjectivity) passes over into that of <em>judgment</em> in Chapter
2. It is important to grasp the basic contours of Hegel&rsquo;s
treatment of judgment as it informs his subsequent treatment of
inference.</p>

<p>
Reprising an etymological point made by H&ouml;lderlin, Hegel notes
that a judgment (<em>Urteil</em>) involves a separation
(<em>Teilung</em>) of parts: in basic terms a predicate is said of
some subject giving the judgment the grammatical form
&ldquo;<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>&rdquo;, but in saying
&ldquo;<em>S</em> <em>is</em> <em>P</em>&rdquo;, the judging subject
affirms the unity existing between the parts. <em>S</em> and
<em>P</em> are thus meant (1) to be diverse, but (2) to form a
unity&mdash;a situation we are now familiar with in terms of the
<em>Aufhebung</em> of parts in a whole. Hegel takes this as signaling
two ways of thinking of the relation of subject and predicate in the
judgment. One can take subject and predicate terms as self-subsistent
entities that are <em>joined</em> in the judgment, or one can take the
judgment itself as the primary unit that <em>splits</em> into subject
and predicate terms. This in fact coincides with the two different
ways in which logical relations have been conceived in the history of
philosophy: the former represents the term-logical approach
characteristic of Aristotle, while the latter represents the
propositional approach characteristic of the Stoics and much recent
philosophy. From the former point of view one thinks of the subject
term as designating a substance, typically grasped as an instance of a
kind, in which properties, designated by predicate terms,
<em>inhere</em>. From the latter point of view, one thinks of
predicate terms as abstract universals that <em>subsume</em> or are
satisfied by entities to which the subject terms refer, an approach
which conceives of the propositional content&mdash;in Stoic
terminology, the <em>lecton</em>, the <em>what-is-said</em>&mdash;as
having a primacy over the parts. Using a distinction from the
Medievals, we can describe the first type of judgments as <em>de
re</em> (about things) and the second as <em>de dicto</em> (about
sayings). These alternative <em>joining</em> and <em>splitting</em>
approaches can in turn be applied to the relationship of judgments
within inferences or syllogisms. While it is more common for
inferences to be thought of as composed of judgments which have their
own <em>truth values</em>, the judgments themselves can be thought of
as gaining their meaning via the role they play in inferences,
parallel to the way that the parts of the judgment can be thought of
as resulting from the judgment&rsquo;s splitting. Within recent
semantic theory, Robert Brandom has argued for such an inferentialist
analysis and has suggested this way of understanding Hegel&rsquo;s
logic (Brandom 2019), a view that fits with Hegel&rsquo;s idea that
the syllogism is the &ldquo;truth of the judgment&rdquo; (SL: 593).
Thought of in terms of the framework of Kant&rsquo;s transcendental
logic, Hegel&rsquo;s position would be akin to allowing
inferences&mdash;syllogisms&mdash;a role in the determination of the
transcendental content of judgments, a role that is not allowed in
Kant.</p>

<p>
As we have said, Hegel&rsquo;s logic is meant somehow to generate a
content&mdash;to produce a type of ontology&mdash;and this comes into
explicit focus with Hegel&rsquo;s puzzling claim in Book III
concerning a syllogism that has become &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; and
&ldquo;full of content&rdquo; that thereby has necessary existence
(SL: 616&ndash;17). In contrast with Kant, Hegel seems to go beyond a
transcendental deduction of the <em>formal</em> conditions of
experience and thought and to a deduction of their <em>material</em>
conditions. Traditionalists will here point to Hegel&rsquo;s allusions
to the ontological proof (SL: 625) of medieval theology in which the
existence of God is seen as necessitated by his concept&mdash;an
argument undermined by Kant&rsquo;s criticism of the treatment of
<em>existence</em> as a predicate. In Hegel&rsquo;s version, it is
said, the objective existence that God achieves in the world is seen
as necessitated by his essential self-consciousness. Non-traditional
readings, in contrast, would have to interpret this aspect of
Hegel&rsquo;s logic very differently. Brandom&rsquo;s inferentialist
interpretation of Hegel, when joined to ideas taken from Hegel&rsquo;s
treatment of self-consciousness in the <em>Phenomenology</em>,
suggests a way forward here.</p>

<p>
The first thing to be emphasized here is that we shouldn&rsquo;t think
of judgments and their contents as something like mental
contents&mdash;subjective or psychological states of a thinker&rsquo;s
mind. Such a psychologistic attitude was opposed by Hegel just as it
was opposed by a figure central to modern logic, Gottlob Frege. For
Frege, thoughts are not mental, rather they are abstract entities like
numbers, so the problem facing us is not how to go from mental
contents to the concrete world, it is how to go from abstract ones to
concrete ones. But here we must keep in mind Hegel&rsquo;s two-fold
way of thinking about judgments, <em>de dicto</em> and <em>de re</em>,
and while it is usual to think of the contents of <em>de dicto</em>
judgments as abstract (here to think of the content as propositional
is usual), some have thought of the contents of <em>de re</em>
judgments as including <em>the thing i</em>tself (the
&ldquo;<em>re</em>&rdquo;) that the judgment is about. (In fact
Bertrand Russell had, at one point in his career, entertained such an
idea of propositional content itself.) Thus when Hegel characterizes
some judgment structures (typically perception-based judgments) as
<em>judgments of existence</em>, one might take the perceived thing
<em>qua</em> self-sufficient &ldquo;singular&rdquo; as
straightforwardly part of the content of the judgment. It is a
concrete object, but not grasped as a concrete simple, but grasped in
relation to what is judged <em>of it</em> in the predicate. And to the
extent that judgments can be considered components of syllogisms, we
might appreciate how syllogisms might have become contentful in a
process that has culminated in the concrete syllogism of
necessity.</p>

<p>
If the concrete object of a <em>de re</em> judgment is effectively
what had been under consideration in Chapter 2 (Perception) of the
<em>Phenomenology</em> (the thing with properties), we now might
envisage where Hegel&rsquo;s thought is headed in these sections of
the subjective logic. In the <em>Phenomenology</em> it had turned out
that a precondition of a subject&rsquo;s capacity to be conscious of
objects, such as perceptual ones, was that subject&rsquo;s
<em>self</em>-consciousness. It then turned out that to be capable of
self-consciousness the subject had to exist in a world with other
embodied subjects whose intentions it could recognize. It is here that
we might pick up Robert Brandom&rsquo;s suggestion, following Sellars,
that we should think of the existence of inferential processes or
processes of reasoning as presupposing participation within social
communicative interactions in which the making of an assertion is
considered as a move in a language-game of the &ldquo;giving and
asking for reasons&rdquo;. In short, we may think of Hegel&rsquo;s
syllogism of necessity, which constitutes the ground or
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; of the earlier formal conception of syllogisms, as
a type of inter-subjective practice embodying thought&mdash;a type of
syllogising practice that is by necessity inter-subjective and
recognitive. Formally considered we might think of this syllogism as
the logical schematization of the most developed form of recognition
in which thinkers acknowledge others as free thinkers.</p>

<p>
I have suggested that in the syllogism of necessity with which
Hegel&rsquo;s treatment of inference terminates we get a glimpse of a
type of contentful and dynamic rational process unfolding in the midst
of the recognitive and communicative interactions between finite
living and intentional beings. What we see here is a reprise of the
conception of <em>logos</em> as an objective process running through
the world, as had been conceived by the ancient Stoics and
neo-Platonists. But it is now embedded not simply in the world as
such&mdash;in nature&mdash;but specifically in objectivized
<em>spirit</em>, in human communities of thinkers, themselves grounded
in, but not reducible to, nature. We are now returned to the domain of
objectivity that had characterized Books I and II of the <em>Science
of Logic</em>, but we might expect such a return from subjectivity to
have effected a change in objectivity as earlier understood.</p>

<p>
To cross straight into a consideration of the objectivity of the human
world of action and thought&mdash;spirit&mdash;would be to break the
developmental pattern of the logic, because thought about such a
complex form of objective existence will presuppose thought about
simpler forms. And so the starting point for the consideration of
objectivity will again be that of the simple object as something
immediately grasped by thought. But this object can now be developed
with that elaborate conceptual apparatus that has emerged in the
preceding section. Progression here will be from a na&iuml;ve and
immediate concept of an object as simple self-sufficient thing, a
thing with its identity centered on itself, through the more complex
idea of an object as grasped from within the interstices of physical
and chemical thought, to the models of teleological and living
systems. The <em>Logic</em> then transitions into a consideration of
the &ldquo;<em>adequate concept</em>, the objectively <em>true</em>,
or the <em>true as such</em>&rdquo; (SL: 670). This adequate concept
is <em>the Idea</em>, which, after tracking through considerations of
the living individual and theoretical and practical cognition, emerges
as <em>the Absolute Idea</em>.</p>

<h3 id="HegEncSysExp">3.2 Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Encyclopaedic</em> System and its Expansions</h3>

<p>
As we have mentioned, Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Encyclopaedia of Philosophical
Sciences</em> was written as a teaching manual, various parts of which
were later expanded upon in lecture courses devoted to specific parts
of the system. For the most part, the first of the three parts of the
<em>Encyclopaedia</em> can be considered as a condensed version of his
earlier <em>Science of Logic.</em> As this has been considered above,
we will pass over to a consideration of the two remaining parts,
Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> and <em>Philosophy of
Spirit</em>.</p>

<h4 id="PhiNat">3.2.1 Philosophy of Nature</h4>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> (first published as such
in 1842, and based on &sect;&sect;245&ndash;376 from the 1830
<em>Encyclopaedia</em>, supplemented by material and student
transcripts from Hegel&rsquo;s Berlin lectures) has often been damned
by the contention that Hegel had simply <em>dismissed</em> the
activity of the empirical sciences, especially Newtonian science, as
based upon the inadequacies of the <q>logic of the understanding</q>,
and in their place had attempted to give an account of the natural
world as entirely deduced from logical principles. In fact, criticisms
of this type had first emerged in response to Hegel&rsquo;s earliest
foray into this area in his 1801 dissertation at the University of
Jena, <q>On the Orbits of the Planets</q>. Critics had portrayed Hegel
as trying to <q>deduce</q> the number of planets in the solar system
in an <em>a priori</em> way&ndash;a criticism that defenders of Hegel
have argued was based on distorted readings of his text (see, for
example, Posch 2011 and Ferrini 2012). It is true that Hegel had
supported the views of some natural philosophers&ndash;classically
Kepler (PN: &sect; 270, remark) and, more controversially, Goethe (PN:
&sect; 320, addition) over Newton in ways motivated by his own logical
considerations. In the case of Newton, however, it is fair to say that
Hegel&rsquo;s more negative assessments were directed at what Hegel
took to be the <q>monstrous</q> metaphysics implicit in his work
rather than its actual scientific content (PN: &sect; 270, remark).
While many supporters of Hegel&rsquo;s general philosophy had been
reluctant to support this aspect of Hegel&rsquo;s work (see, e.g.,
Beiser 2003), over the last few decades Hegel interpreters have
started to push back against the earlier dismissal of Hegel&rsquo;s
views on the modern sciences, revealing the complexities of his
position and emphasizing his broad familiarity with the natural
science of his time (see, for example, the essays in Houlgate 1998 and
Bykova 2024).</p>

<p>
The objection that Hegel was trying to pre-empt the work of empirical
science by deducing the state of the world from logical considerations
alone is often summed up under the slogan of <q>deducing Krug&rsquo;s
pen</q>, given that in 1801 the philosopher W. T. Krug had accused not
Hegel but Schelling of aiming to deduce from philosophical principles
all contingent worldly phenomena, even the nature of the pen with
which he, Krug, was writing his critique. Hegel responded to
Krug&rsquo;s accusation in the following year, claiming that Krug had
made the common mistake of conflating <em>the</em>
<em>understanding</em> with <em>reason</em>, and treating <em>the
Absolute</em> as on the same level as finite things. While Hegel and
Schelling would soon part ways, Hegel nevertheless clearly thought
that his rejection of Krug&rsquo;s point held, and would later make
similar points against Krug in his <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The impotence on the part of nature sets limits to philosophy, and it
is the height of pointlessness to demand of the Concept
[<em>Begriff</em>] that it should explain, and as it is said, construe
or deduce these contingent products of nature. (PN: &sect; 250,
remark, Krug is mentioned in a footnote)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The point is expanded upon later when he notes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is an error on the part of the philosophy of nature to attempt to
face up to all phenomena; this is done in the finite sciences, where
everything has to be reduced to general conceptions (hypotheses). In
these sciences the empirical element is the sole confirmation of the
hypothesis, so that everything has to be explained. (PN: &sect; 270,
addition)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is now often argued that this position is consistent with the way
that Hegel describes nature early in the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>
in its relation to the Absolute Idea with which <em>The Science
of</em> <em>Logic</em> had ended. Nature is, simply, <q>the Idea in
the form of <em>otherness</em></q>, it is the Idea that has become
<q>the negative of itself, or <em>external</em> <em>to
itself</em></q>. Nature, he goes on, <q>is not merely external
relative to this Idea &hellip; but is embodied as nature is the
determination of <em>externality</em></q> (PN: &sect; 247; for helpful
discussions of these perplexing formulae see Martin 2021 and Nuzzo
2024). As he repeats in the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em>, in
<em>The</em> <em>Science of Logic</em> Hegel refers to the
<q>impotence</q> of nature in that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it cannot abide by and exhibit the rigor of the concept and loses
itself in a blind manifoldness void of concept. ... The manifold
genera and species of nature must not be esteemed to be anything more
than arbitrary notions of spirit engaged in pictorial representations.
Both indeed show traces and intimations of the concept, but they do
not exhibit it in trustworthy copy, for they are the sides of its free
self-externality. (SL: 536)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Passages such as this have given rise to disputes among proponents of
the post-Kantian and revised metaphysical interpretations of Hegel as
to the role of concepts in nature, with some (e.g., Stern and Weiss
2024; Kreines 2015; Westphal 2008) advocating a <q>conceptual
realist</q> interpretation of Hegel such that concepts are
<em>objective</em> universals in the form of laws and natural kinds
<q>immanent in the world</q> (for details, see Stern and Weiss 2024).
For them, despite passages such as the above in which nature is
apparently described as a <q>blind manifoldness void of concept</q>,
we must understand nature as a <em>conceptual</em> realm in the sense
of Aristotelian essentialism. In contrast, from a more post-Kantian
perspective, such conceptual realist or essentialist interpretations
have been contested (e.g., Stein 2024; Bowman 2013). In particular,
Martin, for example, has argued that while for Hegel there is
objective <em>structure</em> in nature in the form of <q>recurrent
self-preserving configurations within the inhomogeneous continuum that
allow to be articulated and known by means of discursive thinking</q>
(Martin 2021: 88, see also 104), such structure is not conceptual in
the properly logical sense.</p>

<p>
After an Introduction, Section One of the <em>Philosophy of
Nature</em>, Mechanics, expands on this progression through
considerations of space and time, matter considered as the diversity
of individual moving bodies distributed in space and time (for a
helpful account, see Kaufmann, Lyssy and Yeomans 2021), and finally
the idea of universal gravitation as the determinate concept of such
corporeal matter realized as <em>idea</em> (PN: &sect;270). In the
Newtonian laws of mechanics, however, the unity of matter is still
only <em>formal</em>, and in Section Two, Physics, the determinateness
of form is now considered as <em>immanent within</em> such corporeal
matter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Matter has individuality to the extent that it is determined within
itself by having being-for-self developed within it. It is through
this determination that matter breaks away from gravity and manifests
itself as implicitly self-determining. (PN: &sect;273)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While the Mechanics section clearly reflects the more space-filling
conception of matter dominant in British thought, the Physics section
is consistent with the more dynamic continental European conception of
matter originating in Leibniz with his idea of living forces. Within
this framework, Hegel attempts to organize a vast array of areas of
contemporary physical investigation including meteorology, theories of
sound and heat, light and electricity, up to and including chemical
processes which stand on the threshold of Organic Physics, dealt with
in Section Three. The study of organics represents a return to the
consideration of the individual body with which Mechanics had started,
but now considered as &ldquo;infinite process in which the
individuality determines itself as the particularity or finitude which
it also negates, and returns into itself by re-establishing itself at
the end of the process as the beginning&rdquo;. The body is now
&ldquo;an <em>impregnated</em> and negative unity, which by relating
itself to itself, has become essentially <em>self-centred and
subjective</em>&rdquo; (PN: &sect;337, italics in original). From such
a conception, the first body to be considered is that of the earth
itself, along with its history. Chapter Two moves to a consideration
of the plant, and Chapter Three the animal organism.</p>

<p>
From the point of view of the actual content of scientific theories
and approaches that Hegel summarizes and locates within his system,
his <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> is clearly a product of his time.
Nevertheless, many of the underlying philosophical issues dealt with
are still now far from settled. Thus, while Newtonian physics clearly
became established in ways that made Leibniz&rsquo;s dynamic physics
seem obsolete as empirical theory, debate still goes on as to whether
space-time in post-Newtonian physics is to be conceived in Newtonian
or Leibnizian ways.</p>

<h4 id="PhiSubObjSpi">3.2.2 Philosophy of Subjective and Objective Spirit</h4>

<p>
In the <em>Encyclopaedia</em>, <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> is
followed by <em>Philosophy of Spirit</em> (<em>Geist</em>).
Hegel&rsquo;s usual triadic pattern when applied here results in
sections devoted to the philosophies of subjective spirit, objective
spirit, and absolute spirit. Philosophy of subjective spirit
constitutes what is closest in Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy to a
philosophical psychology in the contemporary sense (Ik&auml;heimo
2017), while the philosophy of objective spirit concerns those
objective patterns of social interaction and the cultural institutions
within which spirit is objectified in patterns of human life which we
have seen at work in <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (Pippin 2008;
Kerv&eacute;gan 2018). Within subjective spirit, the first division,
Anthropology, follows on, as we might anticipate, from topics with
which <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> ends&mdash;the animal organism
(Novakovik 2017). Thus here Hegel is concerned with what he terms
<em>Seele</em>, &ldquo;soul&rdquo;&mdash;which seems to translate more
the ancient Greek term <em>psyche</em>&mdash;and hence with the
<em>mind-body</em> relation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If soul and body are absolutely opposed to one another as is
maintained by the abstractive intellectual consciousness,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hegel comments,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
then there is no possibility of any community between them. The
community was, however, recognized by ancient metaphysics as an
undeniable fact. (PN: &sect; 389 add)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Seele</em> of Anthropology should therefore not be confused
with the modern subjective conception of mind, as exemplified by
Descartes and other early modern philosophers. Aristotle had conceived
of the soul as the form of the body, not as a substance separate from
that of the body, and had attributed lesser souls to animals and even
plants. (Again, Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of substantial form comes
into view.) Concomitantly, in this section Hegel describes spirit as
sunk in nature, and treats consciousness as largely limited to what
now might be described as sentient or phenomenal consciousness
alone&mdash;the feeling soul. Consciousness in the sense of the modern
subject&ndash;object opposition only makes its appearance in the
following second section, Phenomenology of Spirit, which, reprising
key moments from the earlier book of that name, raises a problem for
how we are to understand the relation of phenomenology and systematic
philosophy: is it a path to it or part of it? Given that the
recognitive approach to self-consciousness presupposes that potential
self-consciousnesses are in fact embodied and located in the world, we
would expect the mind as treated in Psychology to be no less embodied
than the way in which it is conceived in Anthropology. What in fact
distinguishes the mind of Psychology from that of Anthropology is its
rational capacities, considered in terms that would now be described
as normative rather than simply naturalistic, and this for Hegel
clearly signals a difference in the way in which an actual
psychological subject <em>relates to</em> his or her own body. The
type of abstractive thinking found in Psychology does not, of course,
as in mythical images of metempsychosis&mdash;a favorite trope of
Platonists&mdash;involve the mind leaving the body. This would count
for Hegel as a piece of mythical picture thinking&mdash;a
<em>Vorstellung.</em> Rather, it involves a certain capacity of the
psychological subject to suspend unreflected-upon endorsement of the
claims made on behalf of his or her body, for example, to subject the
evidence given by the senses to rational scrutiny.</p>

<p>
Given the dialectical mode in which Hegel&rsquo;s texts progress, as
seen already in both <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> and <em>Science
of Logic</em>, we will expect the capacities examined in Psychology to
ultimately depend upon those that come under consideration in the
context of Objective Spirit. In this sense, we are witnessing, within
another mode, the type of progression seen in the movement in
Phenomenology from shapes of consciousness to shapes of spirit. The
internal <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> seems to play an important
role in setting up this transition from Psychology to Objective Spirit
(Williams 2007), but it might also be seen as crucial in relating the
more cognitive dimensions of Psychology back to the theme of
embodiment prominent in Anthropology (Nuzzo 2013a). Thus any
<em>naturalistic analysis</em> is ultimately surpassed by a social and
historical one, which, nonetheless, cannot itself be understood as
anti-naturalistic.</p>

<p>
The philosophy of subjective spirit passes over into that of objective
spirit, which concerns the objective patterns of social interaction
and the cultural institutions within which spirit is objectified
(Pippin 2008; Yeomans 2012). The book entitled <em>Elements of the
Philosophy of Right</em>, published in 1821 as a textbook to accompany
Hegel&rsquo;s lectures at the University of Berlin, essentially
corresponds to a more developed version of the philosophy of objective
spirit and will be considered next.</p>

<h5>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</h5>

<p>
The <em>Philosophy of Right</em> (as it is more commonly called) can
be read as a political philosophy that stands independently of the
system (Wood 1990; Tunick 1992), despite the fact that Hegel intended
it to be read against the background of the developing conceptual
determinations of the <em>Logic</em> (Abazari 2023). The text proper
starts from the conception of a singular willing subject (grasped from
the point of view of its individual self-consciousness) as the bearer
of <em>abstract</em> right. While this conception of the individual
willing subject possessing some kind of fundamental rights was in fact
the starting point of many modern political philosophies (such as that
of Locke, for example) the fact that Hegel commences here does not
testify to any ontological assumption that the consciously willing and
right-bearing individual is the basic atom from which all society can
be understood as constructed&mdash;an idea at the heart of standard
social contract theories. Rather, this is simply the most immediate
starting point of Hegel&rsquo;s presentation and corresponds to
analogous starting places of the <em>Phenomenology</em> and the
<em>Logic</em>. Just as the categories of the <em>Logic</em> develop
in a way meant to demonstrate that what had at the start been
conceived as simple is in fact only made determinate in virtue of its
being a functional part of some larger structure or process, here too
it is meant to be shown that any simple willing and right-bearing
subject only gains its determinacy in virtue of a place it finds for
itself in a larger social, and ultimately historical, structure or
process. Thus, even a contractual exchange (the minimal social
interaction for contract theorists) is not to be thought of simply as
an occurrence consequent upon the existence of two beings with natural
animal wants and some natural calculative rationality, as in Hobbes,
say; rather, the system of interaction within which individual
exchanges take place (the economy) will be treated holistically as a
culturally-shaped form of social life within which the actual wants of
individuals as well as their reasoning powers are given determinate
forms. Hegel is well aware of the distinctive modernity of this form
of social life.</p>

<p>
Here too it becomes apparent that Hegel, taking up themes from the
<em>Phenomenology</em>, follows Fichte in treating property in terms
of a <em>recognitive</em> analysis of the nature of such a right
(Williams 1997). A contractual exchange of commodities between two
individuals itself involves an implicit act of recognition in as much
as each, in giving something to the other in exchange for what they
want, is thereby recognizing that other as a proprietor of that thing,
or, more properly, of the inalienable value attaching to it (PR:
&sect;&sect;72&ndash;81). By contrast, such proprietorship would be
denied rather than recognised in fraud or theft&mdash;forms of wrong
(<em>Unrecht</em>) in which right is negated rather than acknowledged
or posited (&sect;&sect;82&ndash;93). Thus what differentiates
property from mere possession is that it is grounded in a relation of
reciprocal recognition between two willing subjects (&sect;71 and
remark). Moreover, it is in the exchange relation that we can see what
it means for Hegel for individual subjects to share a <em>common
will</em>&mdash;an idea which will have important implications with
respect to the difference of Hegel&rsquo;s conception of the state
from that of Rousseau. Such an interactive constitution of the common
will means that for Hegel the identity among wills is achieved because
of not in spite of co-existing differences between the particular
wills of the subjects involved: while contracting individuals both
will the same exchange, at a more concrete level, they do so with
different ends in mind. Each wants something different from the
exchange. Without this difference, the type of absorption of
individual subjects into collective <em>substance</em> of the type of
Hegel worries about in relation to Spinoza would occur (&sect;258
remark).</p>

<p>
Hegel passes from the abstractly individualistic frame of Abstract
Right to the social determinacies of <em>Sittlichkeit</em> or Ethical
Life (PR: &sect;142). First he considers <em>wrong</em>, the negation
of right (&sect;&sect;82&ndash;96), and the punishment that such wrong
entails, which is the negation of wrong, and hence the &ldquo;negation
of the negation&rdquo; of the original right
(&sect;&sect;97&ndash;104). Then he considers <em>morality</em>,
conceived more or less as an internalisation of the external legal
relations presupposed by punishment. Consideration of Hegel&rsquo;s
version of the retributivist approach to punishment affords a good
example of his use of the logic of negation. In punishing the criminal
the state makes it clear to its members that it is the acknowledgment
of right <em>per se</em> that is essential to developed social life:
the significance of acknowledging another&rsquo;s right in the
contractual exchange cannot be, as it at first might have appeared to
the participants, simply that of an instrumental means by which each
gets what he or she wants from the other.</p>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s treatment of punishment also brings out the continuity
of his way of conceiving of the structure and dynamics of the social
world with that of Kant, as Kant too, in his <em>Metaphysics of
Morals</em> had employed the idea of the state&rsquo;s punitive action
as a <em>negating</em> of the original criminal act. Kant&rsquo;s
idea, conceived on the model of the physical principle of action and
reaction, was structured by the category of community or reciprocal
interaction, and was conceived as involving what he called <em>real
opposition</em>. Such an idea of opposed dynamic forces seems to form
something of a model for Hegel&rsquo;s idea of contradiction and the
starting point for his conception of reciprocal recognition.
Nevertheless, clearly Hegel articulates the structures of recognition
in more complex ways than those derivable from Kant&rsquo;s category
of community.</p>

<p>
First of all, in Hegel&rsquo;s analysis of <em>Sittlichkeit</em>, the
type of sociality found in the market-based civil society is to be
understood as dependent upon and in contrastive opposition with the
more immediate form found in the institution of the family: a form of
sociality mediated by a quasi-natural inter-subjective recognition
rooted in sentiment and feeling&mdash;love (PR: &sect;&sect;
158&ndash;60). (This dependence shows how <em>anthropological</em>
determinations do not simply disappear with the development of more
<em>psychological</em> ones&mdash;they are preserved as well as
negated, as in the pattern of what is <em>aufgehoben</em> or sublated.
It also shows the mutual dependence of the determinations of the
<em>singularity</em> of the atomistic subjects of civil society and
their <em>particularity</em> as members (parts) of holistically
conceived families.) Here Hegel seems to have extended Fichte&rsquo;s
legally characterized notion of recognition into the types of human
inter-subjectivity earlier broached by H&ouml;lderlin and the
romantics. In the family the particularity of each individual tends to
be absorbed into the social unit (one is a part of one&rsquo;s
family), giving this manifestation of <em>Sittlichkeit</em> a
one-sidedness that is the inverse of that found in market relations in
which participants grasp themselves in the first instance as singular
(<em>einzeln</em>) self-identical individuals who then enter into
relationships that are external to them.</p>

<p>
These two opposite but interlocking principles of social existence
provide the basic structures in terms of which the component parts of
the modern state are articulated and understood. As both contribute
particular characteristics to the subjects involved in them, part of
the problem for the rational state will be to ensure that each of
these two principles mediates the other, each thereby mitigating the
<em>o</em>ne-sidedness of the other. Thus, individuals who encounter
each other in the external relations of the market place and who have
their subjectivity shaped by such relations also belong to families
where they are subject to opposed influences. Moreover, even within
the ensemble of production and exchange mechanisms of civil society,
individuals will belong to particular estates (the agricultural
estate, that of trade and industry, or the <em>universal</em> estate
to which civil servants belong (universal because the state
constitutes the most comprehensive form of social existence (PR:
&sect;&sect;199&ndash;208)). These forms of sociality will in turn
show some family-like features.</p>

<p>
Although the actual details of Hegel&rsquo;s mapping of the
categorical structures of the <em>Logic</em> onto the <em>Philosophy
of Right</em> are far from clear, the general motivation is apparent.
Hegel&rsquo;s logical categories can be read as an attempt to provide
a schematic account of the material (rather than formal) conditions
required for a developed self-consciousness for whom rationality and
freedom are maximized. Thus we might regard the various syllogisms of
Hegel&rsquo;s Subjective Logic as attempts to chart the skeletal
structures of those different types of recognitive inter-subjectivity
necessary to sustain various aspects of rational cognitive and
conative functioning (self-consciousness). From this perspective, we
might see his logical schematisation of the modern rational state as a
way of displaying just those sorts of mediating institutions that a
state must provide if it is to answer Rousseau&rsquo;s question of the
form of association needed for the formation and expression of the
general will.</p>

<p>
Concretely, for Hegel it is representation of the estates within the
legislative bodies that is to achieve this (PR:
&sect;&sect;301&ndash;14). As the estates of civil society group their
members according to their common interests, and as the deputies
elected from the estates to the legislative bodies give voice to those
interests within the deliberative processes of legislation, the
outcome of this process might give expression to the general interest.
But Hegel&rsquo;s republicanism is here balanced by his invocation of
the familial principle: such representative bodies can only provide
the <em>content</em> of the legislation to a constitutional monarch
who must add to it the <em>form</em> of the royal decree&mdash;an
individual &ldquo;I will &hellip;&rdquo; (&sect;&sect;275&ndash;81).
To declare that for Hegel the monarch plays only a symbolic role here
is to miss the fundamentally idealist complexion of his political
philosophy. The expression of the general will in legislation cannot
be thought of as an outcome of some quasi-mechanical process: it must
be willed. If legislation is to express the general will, citizens
must recognize it as expressing <em>their</em> wills; and this means,
recognising it <em>as</em> willed. The monarch&rsquo;s explicit
&ldquo;I will&rdquo; is thus needed to close this recognitive circle,
lest legislation look like a mechanical compromise resulting from a
clash of contingent interests, and so as actively willed by nobody.
Thus while Hegel is critical of standard social contract theories, his
own conception of the state is still clearly a complicated
transformation of those of Rousseau and Kant.</p>

<p>
Perhaps one of the most influential parts of Hegel&rsquo;s
<em>Philosophy of Right</em> is his analysis of the contradictions of
the unfettered capitalist economy. On the one hand, Hegel agreed with
Adam Smith that the interlinking of productive activities allowed by
the modern market meant that &ldquo;subjective selfishness&rdquo;
turned into a &ldquo;contribution towards the satisfaction of the
needs of everyone else&rdquo; (PR: &sect;199). But this did not mean
that he accepted Smith&rsquo;s idea that the &ldquo;general
plenty&rdquo; this produced thereby diffused (or &ldquo;trickled
down&rdquo;) though the rest of society. From within the type of
consciousness generated within civil society, in which individuals are
grasped as bearers of rights abstracted from the particular concrete
relationships to which they belong, Smithean optimism may seem
justified. But this simply attests to the one-sidedness of this type
of abstract thought, and the need for it to be mediated by the type of
consciousness based in the family in which individuals are grasped in
terms of the way they <em>belong to</em> the social body. In fact, the
unfettered operation of the market <em>produces</em> a class caught in
a spiral of poverty. Starting from this analysis, Marx later used it
as evidence of the need to abolish the individual proprietorial rights
at the heart of Hegel&rsquo;s civil society and socialise the means of
production. Hegel, however, did not draw this conclusion. His
conception of the exchange contract as a form of recognition that
played an essential role within the state&rsquo;s capacity to provide
the conditions for the existence of rational and free-willing subjects
would certainly prevent such a move. Rather, the economy was to be
contained within an over-arching institutional framework of the state,
and its social effects offset by welfarist intervention. Some of
Hegel&rsquo;s most telling criticisms of the unmediated effects of
modern civil society concern those on the psychological lives of
individuals. Recently, an approach to social reality with Hegelian
provenance that uses the notion of recognition to reflect critically
on existing social practices has been developed in different ways by
Robert Williams (1997) and Axel Honneth (2010; see also Ik&auml;heimo
and Laitinen 2011), testifying to the continuing relevance of
Hegel&rsquo;s analyses.</p>

<h5>Philosophy of History</h5>

<p>
The final twenty paragraphs of the <em>Philosophy of Right</em> (and
the final five paragraphs of the Objective Spirit section of the
<em>Encyclopaedia</em>) are devoted to world history (<em>die
Weltgeschichte</em>), and they also coincide with the point of
transition from objective to absolute spirit. We have already seen the
relevance of historical issues for Hegel in the context of the
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>, such that a series of different
forms of objective spirit can be grasped in terms of the degree to
which they enable the development of a universalizable
self-consciousness capable of rationality and freedom. Hegel was to
enlarge on these ideas in a lecture series given five times during his
Berlin period, and it was via the text assembled on the basis of these
lectures by his son Karl that many readers would be introduced to
Hegel&rsquo;s ideas after his death.</p>

<p>
World history is made up of the histories of particular peoples within
which spirit assumes some &ldquo;particular principle on the lines of
which it must run through a development of its consciousness and its
actuality&rdquo; (PM: &sect;548). Just the same dialectic that we have
first seen operative among shapes of consciousness in the
<em>Phenomenology</em> and among categories or thought-determinations
in the <em>Logic</em> can be observed here. An historical community
acts on the principle that informs its social life, while the
experience and memory of this action and its consequences (a memory
encoded in the stories that circulate in the community) result in this
principle becoming available for the self-consciousness of the
community. The loss of immediacy that accompanies this reflective
self-consciousness can undermine the original principle, and this can
be part of the fashioning of a new principle and, effectively, a new
type of community:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in rendering itself objective and making this its being an object of
thought, [spirit] on the one hand destroys the determinate form of its
being, and on the other hand gains a comprehension of the universal
element which it involves, and thereby gives a new form to its
inherent principle &hellip; [which] has risen into another, and in
fact a higher principle. (PWH: 81)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This dialectic links a sequence of community types into a
developmental narrative which shows</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the path of liberation for the spiritual substance, the deed by which
the absolute final aim of the world is realized in it, and the merely
implicit mind achieves consciousness and self-consciousness. (PM:
&sect;549)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is a dialectic, however, which only passes through some
communities. Hegel&rsquo;s is a clearly Eurocentric account of
history. (For a view that acknowledges this dimension but attempts to
divest Hegel&rsquo;s basic account of it, see Pinkard 2017a.)</p>

<p>
It is thus that &ldquo;the analysis of the successive grades [of
universal history] in their abstract form belongs to logic&rdquo;
(PWH: 56), but once more it must be stressed that, as with philosophy
of nature, philosophy of history is not meant to somehow magically
<em>deduce</em> actual empirical historical phenomena, like
Krug&rsquo;s pen; rather, it takes the results of actual empirical
history as its material and attempts to find exemplified within this
material the categorial progressions found in the logic. Thus, the
activity of the philosophical historian presupposes that of
&ldquo;original&rdquo; and &ldquo;reflective&rdquo; historians (PWH:
1&ndash;8). The actual world is full of contingencies from which
empirical historians will have already abstracted in constructing
their narratives, for example, when writing from particular national
perspectives. To grasp history philosophically, however, will be to
grasp it from the perspective of world-history itself, and this
provides the transition to <em>absolute</em> spirit, as world history
will be understood in terms of the manifestation of what from a
religious perspective is called &ldquo;God&rdquo;, or from a
philosophical perspective &ldquo;reason&rdquo;. Hegel clearly thinks
that there is a way of cognitively relating to history that goes
beyond the standpoint of consciousness and the understanding&mdash;the
standpoint of what we now think of as informing scientific history.
From the perspective of consciousness history is something that stands
over against me <em>qua</em> something known, but from the standpoint
of <em>self</em>-consciousness I grasp this history as the history of
that which contributes to <em>me</em>, qua rational and free
being.</p>

<h4 id="PhiAbsSpi">3.2.3 Philosophy of Absolute Spirit</h4>

<p>
The subject matter of the final twenty-five paragraphs of the
<em>Philosophy of Spirit</em> section of the <em>Encyclopaedia</em>,
Absolute Spirit, came to be expanded massively into the contents of
three different series of lectures, on philosophy of art, religion,
and history of philosophy, given multiple times during Hegel&rsquo;s
decade in Berlin. Assembled and published in the years immediately
following his death, these were the works through which Hegel was to
become known as perhaps the most significant synoptic theorist of
these cultural phenomena. Rather than to attempt to capture the
richness of his thought here in a few paragraphs, I will simply try to
allude to how this material is meant to draw upon the conceptual
resources noted so far.</p>

<h5>Art</h5>

<p>
Hegel was writing in a time of intense development of ideas about the
arts. Kant had treated aesthetic experience largely in relation to the
experience of the beauty of nature, but for Hegel aesthetics becomes
primarily about art. The reason for this is simple: art is an
objective medium in which a community collectively reflects upon
itself, and the art of historical peoples is to be understood as the
attempt to bring before the consciousnesses of its members the
totality of what is. It is as art that &ldquo;consciousness of the
Absolute first takes shape&rdquo; (PM: &sect;556). The peculiarity of
art lies in the <em>sensuousness</em> of the medium in which its
content is objectified.</p>

<p>
In the 1790s, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Schlegel had given
aesthetics an historical dimension, distinguishing the forms of
ancient and modern art in terms of the contrasts
na&iuml;ve&ndash;sentimental and classical&ndash;romantic. Hegel
adopts Schlegel&rsquo;s terminology to distinguish as
<em>classical</em> the art that thrived in the Greek and Roman worlds
from the <em>romantic</em> art of post-classical times. Again, the
romantic or modern here will be characterized by the depth of a form
of individual <em>subjective</em> consciousness that is largely
missing in antiquity. But those subjects of Greek antiquity, when
psychological determinations were closer to anthropological ones, had
lived with a comfortable felt unity between spirit and body and
between the individual and society. A characteristic of the Greeks was
their <em>Heimatlichkeit</em>&mdash;their collective feeling of being
at home in the world as they were each at home in their bodies. Modern
subjectivity is thereby purchased as the expense of a sense of
abstraction and alienation from the actual world and from the
self&mdash;a consequence of the way the modern subject has become
related to his or her body in a different way.</p>

<p>
Hegel, influenced by the work of a former colleague, the Heidelberg
philologist Friedrich Creuzer, adds to Schlegel&rsquo;s categorization
of art forms by positing a further category of <em>symbolic</em> art,
characterizing the material cultures of ancient Eastern civilizations
such as Persia, India and Egypt. The symbolic art of pantheistic
religions of the East used natural elements to symbolize the gods of
their cultures: Zoroastrianism had taken light, for example, to
symbolize the divine (Aes I: 325), and animal worship was found in the
Egyptians (Aes I: 357). But such actual things had to be distinguished
from what was meant to be symbolized by them, so violence had to be
done to such natural forms in attempts to represent the
absolute&mdash;such cultural products thus becoming &ldquo;bizarre,
grotesque, and tasteless&rdquo; (Aes I: 77), This, however, undermined
their initial function, and the Greeks were able to offer a
dialectical solution to this contradiction. They gave expression to
the Absolute or the Idea by taking as its material the specifically
human form, but only on condition of its being rendered &ldquo;exempt
from all the deficiency of the purely sensuous and from the contingent
finitude of the phenomenal world&rdquo;. But even as idealized in
Greek sculpture, say, the represented Greek god is still an object of
&ldquo;na&iuml;ve intuition and sensuous imagination&rdquo; (Aes I:
77&ndash;8), and as such the classical gods contained the germ of
their own decline as they could not evade</p>

<blockquote>

the finitudes incidental to anthropomorphism [which] pervert the gods

</blockquote>

<p>
A new form of art will be needed to resolve these contradictions, and
this is provided by romantic art. But the material for this form will
not come from within art itself. While Greek art can be understood as
simultaneously belonging to aesthetic and religious realms, romantic
art results from a fission within the symbolic realm of what in the
<em>Phenomenology</em> Hegel had treated as a single category,
Art-Religion. The transition from classical art to romantic art
represents both a liberation of art from religion and of religion from
art and the sensuous. Thus Christianity, whose rituals centered around
the myth of God becoming man in the person of Jesus, had avoided the
type of reliance on the beautiful productions of art in the way that
characterized Greek religions. The shift from classical to romantic
art, then, represents a broader shift between a culture whose final
authority was an aesthetic one and a culture in which this authority
was handed over to religion, and thus represents a shift in the
authoritativeness of different cognitive forms. This loss of ultimate
authority is the meaning of Hegel&rsquo;s often misunderstood thesis
of <em>the death of art</em>. For further discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="../hegel-aesthetics/">Hegel&rsquo;s aesthetics</a>
 as well as Pippin 2013, Moland 2017 and 2019, and Peters 2014.</p>

<h5>Religion</h5>

<p>
After Hegel&rsquo;s death in 1831, his followers soon split into left,
centre and right factions over the issue of religion (Moggach 2006 and
2011). A dispute over an appropriately Hegelian philosophical attitude
to religion had been sparked by the publication in 1835&ndash;6 of
David Strauss&rsquo;s <em>The Life of Jesus Critically
Examined</em>&mdash;the conservative right claiming that Hegelianism
reflected Christian orthodoxy, the left seeing it as a humanistic
doctrine concerning the historical emancipation of mankind. In fact
the implications of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy for religious belief had
been contentious since his rise to prominence in the 1820s. While
officially declaring that philosophy and religion had the same
content&mdash;God&mdash;Hegel claimed that the logical form of
philosophy enabled it to deal with this content in a more developed
way than that which was achievable in the imagistic representational
form of religion. Many opponents were suspicious that the concept of
God was emptied of its proper meaning in the process of Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophical translations and Hegel was suspected by some of
pantheism or atheism. Ultimately, then, the source of the corrosive
effects of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy on religion indeed could appear to
be the insistence that the content of religious belief, like
everything else, be grounded on rational, in fact logical,
considerations&mdash;the logical coherence of the system of philosophy
itself&mdash;rather than on anything like revelation.</p>

<p>
In the writings he had produced in the 1790s Hegel had shown a clear
attraction to the type of folk art-religions of ancient Greece in
contrast to Christianity, whose other-worldly doctrines did not
reflect the kind of <em>Heimatlichkeit</em> (at-homeness) he valued in
the ancient world, and it is common to see Hegel&rsquo;s later embrace
of the Christianity he described as &ldquo;the consummate
religion&rdquo; as an expression of a cultural and political
conservatism of his later years. This underestimates the complexity of
Hegel&rsquo;s evolving views on both philosophy and religion, however.
The limitations of Greek at-homeness in the world had to do with the
inability of Greek life and thought to sustain that dimension of human
existence that is reflected in the category of singularity of the
subject. The fate of Socrates had thus represented the ultimate
incompatibility with the Greek form of life itself of the reflective
individual, the type of individual who could reflectively bring any
belief into question and take a stand against convention. Similar
incompatibilities could be seen reflected in Greek tragedies such as
<em>Antigone</em>.</p>

<p>
With the decline of the Greek world and the rise of the Roman one,
movements such as Stoicism and Christianity would come to give
expression to an individual point of view, but under the social
conditions of Rome or the Middle Ages such a subjective point of view
could only be an alienated one attracted to what, in contrast to Greek
concreteness, would be seen as abstractions. Prior to the modern world
there would be no <em>real</em> place in either everyday life or in
philosophical culture for any <em>non</em>-alienated versions of the
reflective or subjective position that had first emerged with
Socrates&mdash;no form of life in which this individual dimension of
human subjectivity could be at home. But Christianity marked a type of
advance over Stoicism in that its doctrines of the nature of a good
life had a worldly exemplar. Thus in describing the doctrine of the
Stoic sage, Hegel seemed fond of quoting Cicero&rsquo;s dictum that
&lsquo;nobody can say who this sage is&rsquo; (LHP II: 250&ndash;1,
256). It was the abstractness of the Stoics&rsquo; conception of the good
man that was answered by the new religious cult centered on the life
of the historical Christ.</p>

<p>
In this sense Christianity marked a definite advance over the more
intuitively based religious cults to which Hegel had been attracted in
his youth, but it would only be in the modern world that the content
of the core ideas of Christianity could be given proper expression.
Thus Hegel treats medieval Catholicism as still caught in the
abstractions of a transcendent realm and as caught up in a type of
literal reading of this religion&rsquo;s
<em>Vorstellungen</em>&mdash;its pictures. These need to become
conceptualized, which happens under modern Protestantism, and this,
for Hegel, requires a type of demythologization of the religious
content handed down from the past. Christ must somehow come to stand
as an example of the human kind in general, which is the ultimate
bearer of the status of being the son of God. Once more, it is the
purported singularity of the category <em>son of God</em> that must be
brought back into relation to the universality of the human
<em>genus</em>. It is the nature of this result that divided
Hegel&rsquo;s followers into their right and left camps. The
understanding of what Hegel means by the concept <em>religion</em> in
turn becomes tied to understanding what he means by
<em>philosophy</em>. Appropriately the <em>Philosophy of Religion</em>
thus passes over into the final form of Absolute Spirit,
Philosophy&mdash;a science that is the &ldquo;unity of Art and
Religion&rdquo; (PM: &sect;572). The mere six paragraphs devoted to
this science in the <em>Encyclopaedia</em>, dealing almost exclusively
with the relation of philosophy to religion, were to be expanded into
the massive posthumously published three volumes on the
(philosophical) history of philosophy based on various sources
including student transcripts for his lecture series given in
Berlin.</p>

<h5>History of Philosophy</h5>

<p>
In Hegel&rsquo;s time, the idea that philosophy had an historical
development had only recently come into focus. Both Fichte and
Schelling had discussed the idea of a history of reason following
Kant&rsquo;s allusion to such a notion in the closing pages of
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, and systematic approaches to the
history of philosophy had emerged, such as that of W.G. Tennemann,
who, in his massive <em>Geschichte der Philosophy </em>published
between 1798 and 1819, presupposed a type of Kantian framework.
Clearly Hegel&rsquo;s history of philosophy would be a
present-centered one, in which the philosophical narrative would
reveal a development up to the point represented by his own philosophy
as its culmination. It is thus predictably Eurocentric: philosophy
&ldquo;commences in the West&rdquo; because the West is where
&ldquo;this freedom of self-consciousness first comes forth&rdquo;
(LHP I: 99). There is an important caveat to add here, however.
Philosophy is often identified with the capacity for abstract thought,
and this is not confined to Europe and its history. Rather, it is
typical of eastern cultures like those of India and China. As we have
seen in the context of art, Hegel identifies Greek culture with a type
of at-homeness in the world&mdash;what we might think of as the
opposite of a tendency to abstraction and its typical attraction to
the transcendent or other-worldly.</p>

<p>
Greek philosophy, and so philosophy itself, starts with Thales and
Ionian natural philosophy (Redding 2017b). When Thales chooses water
as &ldquo;the principle and substance of all that is&rdquo; (LHP I:
175) he has abstracted the concept <em>water</em> from the stuff
immediately encountered in puddles and so on. Subsequent attempts to
specify what it is that underlies all things show influences of
eastern abstraction, as in Pythagoras&rsquo;s numericism, which is
static and &ldquo;destitute of process or dialectic&rdquo; (LHP I:
212), but later thinkers such as Zeno and Heraclitus grasp that which
is at the heart of things in more dynamic ways. This type of
dialectical thought which grasps the unity of opposites, familiar from
the <em>Phenomenology</em> and the <em>Logic</em>, comes to fruition
in Plato&rsquo;s dialogue <em>Parmenides</em> (LHP I: 261). What we
are witnessing here, of course, is meant to be a progression that in
some sense mirrors the progression of categories in Hegel&rsquo;s own
<em>Logic</em>, but this progression of objective content gets joined
to another dynamic with the appearance of Socrates.</p>

<p>
Socrates was more than a philosopher: he was a &ldquo;world-historical
person&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;main turning-point
[<em>Hauptwendepunkt</em>] of spirit on itself&rdquo; exhibited itself
in his philosophical thought (LHP I: 384). In short, Socrates had
added a subjective dimension to the otherwise natural moral lives of
Athenian citizens, in that he had challenged them to find the
principles not of worldly things but of their own actions, and
challenged them to find these within the resources of their own
individual consciousnesses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of consciousness that in an
anthropological way existed in the first instance in him and became
later on a usual thing. (LHP I: 391)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With this we see &ldquo;moral substance [<em>Sittlichkeit</em>] turn
into reflective morality [<em>Moralit&auml;t</em>]&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the reflection of consciousness into itself&rdquo;. &ldquo;The
spirit of the world here begins to turn, a turn that was later carried
to its completion&rdquo; (LHP I: 407). This completion would be only
achieved in modernity because, as we have seen, Socrates&rsquo;s
challenging of convention in terms of resources taken from individual
consciousness itself was incompatible with the immediacy of Greek
<em>Sittlichkeit</em>.</p>

<p>
Plato and especially Aristotle represent the pinnacle of ancient
philosophy, but this philosophy, no matter how great, represents its
time, that is, the time of the Greek form of spirit, raised to the
level of thought. Neither Plato nor Aristotle can break free in
thought from the contradiction between the conception of autonomous
subjectivity represented by Socrates and the essential collectivity of
Greek culture. Classical Greek philosophy will succumb in the same way
that the Greek polis succumbs to its own internal contradictions, and
what will eventually replace it will be a type of philosophizing
constrained within the doctrinal constraints of the new religion,
Christianity. But Christianity, as we have seen, gives representation
to a solution to the problem of subjectivity encountered in the form
of Socrates.</p>

<p>
Philosophy proper only thrives under conditions of at-homeness in the
world, and such conditions obtained in neither the Roman nor the
medieval world. Hegel then sees both periods of philosophy as
effectively marking time, and it is only in the modern world that
philosophy once more develops. What modern philosophy will reflect is
the universalization of the type of subjectivity we have seen
represented by Socrates in the Greek polis and Jesus in the Christian
religious community (de Boer 2017). Strangely, Hegel nominates two
very antithetic figures as marking the onset of modern philosophy,
Francis Bacon and the German Christian mystic Jacob B&ouml;hme (LHP
III: 170&ndash;216). In the 1825&ndash;6 lectures, Hegel traces the
path of modern philosophy from there through three phases: a first
period of metaphysics comprising Descartes, Spinoza and Malebranche; a
second comprising Locke, Leibniz and others; and the recent
philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Jacobi and Schelling. Of course the
perspective from which this narrative has been written is the absent
final stage within this sequence&mdash;that represented by Hegel
himself. Hegel concludes the lectures with the claim that he has</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
tried to exhibit the necessary procession of this series of spiritual
configurations out of one another, so that each philosophy necessarily
presupposes the one preceding it. Our standpoint is the cognition of
spirit, the knowledge of the idea as spirit, as absolute spirit, which
as absolute opposes itself to another spirit, to the finite spirit. To
recognize that absolute spirit can be <em>for it</em> is this finite
spirit&rsquo;s principle and vocation. (LHP 1825&ndash;6, III: 212,
italics in original)</p>
