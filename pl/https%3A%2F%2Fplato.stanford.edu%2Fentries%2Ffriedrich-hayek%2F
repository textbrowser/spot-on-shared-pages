<h1>Friedrich Hayek</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Sep 15, 2012; substantive revision Fri Feb 28, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Friedrich Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 into a family steeped in
academic life and scientific research. He worked as a statistician
from 1927&ndash;31, became a Lecturer in Economics at the University
of Vienna in 1929, then moved to the University of London in 1931, the
University of Chicago in 1950, and the University of Freiburg in 1962,
retiring in 1967 and moving back to Freiburg. He kept writing into the
1980s, dying in 1992.</p>

<p>
Hayek worked in the areas of philosophy of science, political
philosophy, the free will problem, and epistemology. Hayek saw himself
as more fox than hedgehog, yet for all that his life&rsquo;s work, for
which he won a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, was spent exploring
the nature and significance of spontaneous order. The concept seems
simple, yet Hayek spent six decades refining his idea, evidently
finding elusive the goal of being as clear about it as he aspired to
be.</p>

<p>
This essay concentrates mainly on this enduring theme of Hayek&rsquo;s
work, and on a question: why would the scholar who did more than
anyone in the twentieth century to advance our understanding of price
signals and the emergence of spontaneous orders also be driven to
claim &ldquo;that social justice is a mirage&rdquo; (Hayek 1978b,
57)?</p>

<h2 id="PricSignSponOrde">1. Price Signals and Spontaneous Order</h2>

<h3 id="OrdeWithDesi">1.1 Order Without Design</h3>

<p>
Over hundreds of millions of years, order emerged in the natural
world. How? It is only human to wonder. In contemplating the order of
nature and of society, and moving from observation to explanation,
&ldquo;design arguments&rdquo; come to mind, but like most
philosophers, Hayek deems it fallacious to argue that we need to posit
a designer to explain the emergence of order in nature. (See the entry
on
 <a href="../teleological-arguments/">teleological arguments for God&rsquo;s existence</a>.)
 Hayek, however, was frustrated to find an analogously fallacious
argument from design leading people to treat the emergence of order in
society as requiring a designer (Hayek 1960, 59). Just as no one had
to invent natural selection, no one had to invent the process by which
natural languages evolve. A language is a massively path-dependent
process of unending mutual adjustment. Language evolves
spontaneously.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It would be no exaggeration to say that social theory begins
with&mdash;and has an object only because of&mdash;the discovery that
there exist orderly structures which are the product of the action of
many men but are not the result of human design. In some fields this
is now universally accepted. Although there was a time when men
believed that even language and morals had been invented by some
genius of the past, everybody recognizes now that they are the outcome
of a process of evolution whose results nobody foresaw or designed
(Hayek 1973, 37).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Crucially, it would make no sense to call any language optimally
efficient, yet it makes perfect sense to see languages as highly
refined and effective adaptations to the evolving communication needs
of particular populations (Hayek 1945, 528).</p>

<h3 id="OrdeUnpr">1.2 Order Can Be Unpredictable</h3>

<p>
Natural selection operates on mutations, making the path of natural
selection unpredictable, regardless of how well we understand the
underlying principles. To Hayek, social and cultural evolution are
much the same: driven by innovation, fashion, and shocks that
&ldquo;mutate&rdquo; people&rsquo;s plans in unpredictable ways with
unpredictable results. The system may be more or less logical. Most
things seem in retrospect to have happened for a reason.</p>

<p>
Yet, however logical the system may be, its logic does not render the
system deterministic. We can make predictions in the broadest sense,
such as when we say that increasing the money supply causes prices to
rise, other things equal. However, we have no basis for predicting the
fine details. The system is technically chaotic, to such a degree that
even something as straightforward as prices on next week&rsquo;s stock
exchanges will always remain a matter of guesswork even for experts.
(See the entry on
 <a href="../chaos/">chaos</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="OrdeEmboEsseDeceInfo">1.3 Order Can Embody Essentially Decentralized Information</h3>

<p>
To Hayek, prices are like languages. How do we know how much people
are willing and able to pay for our product? We might hold an auction
and allocate our product to the highest bidder. Alternatively, we
might simply post a price. Then, if revenues are high enough to
sustain our business, then all is well and we do not need to know
whether we are maximizing profit.</p>

<p>
The crucial Hayekian idea: To think that an authority needs to decide
what the price of rice ought to be is like thinking that an authority
needs to decide what sound people ought to make when they want to
refer to rice.</p>

<p>
It is a mundane yet intriguing fact that price signals induce people
to respond to information they do not possess: such as the changing
cost of drilling, or the discovery of a cheap substitute, or that
political unrest has made a key input harder to acquire. Having no
inkling of those variables, buyers nevertheless respond to them in a
rational way, because they know the one thing they need to know:
namely, the price (Hayek 1978a, 4).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Assume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of
some raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of
supply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our
purpose&mdash;and it is very significant that it does not
matter&mdash;which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All
that the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used
to consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in
consequence, they must economize tin (Hayek 1945, 526).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="CommTendSponOrde">1.4 Communities Tend To Be Spontaneous Orders</h3>

<p>
What emerges from the haggling is not only a deal, but something
larger: a community. There was no central decision about who should
produce tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision about who
should consume tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision
about what should be given in return for tin. All that happened is
that some people guessed that if they were to produce tin and bring it
to market, it would be worth something to customers&mdash;enough to
make the venture worthwhile. When some of these guesses prove correct
and trades get consummated, a market in tin emerges and becomes part
of what is bringing people together as partners in mutually beneficial
ventures.</p>

<p>
Price signals thus <em>economize</em> on information. In the process,
prices induce emerging expectations and patterns of cooperation that
involve multitudes. Cooperation evolves among people who need not
share a language, need not be aware of each other&rsquo;s existence,
and need not be aware of their mutual dependence. They are only
vaguely aware of the thousands of jobs that need doing so as to supply
inputs that enable them to have a finished product to sell. Particular
agents may never have more than a glimpse of the big picture, yet they
manage to come together to form a community, and almost all are vastly
better off as a result.</p>

<h2 id="Prog">2. Progress</h2>

<p>
Technological progress extends the frontiers of the possible. To
Hayek, it is the freedom of the few to do something novel that matters
most, not the freedom of the many to do something familiar.
Accordingly, the freedom I exercise myself need not be the freedom
that has the most bearing on my future (Hayek 1960, 32). Early
adopters, for example, finance research that brings down production
costs, in the process financing a dispersion of products and services
at falling prices that eventually enable late adopters like me to
access the market. I may never trade with early adopters, yet I depend
on them to finance the invention and ongoing re-invention of products
whose marginal cost eventually falls to a point where I can afford
them.</p>

<p>
Often, technological progress consists of innovations that lower
<em>transaction cost</em>: steam boat, railroad, air travel,
telegraph, telephone, internet, bar code reader, &ldquo;apps&rdquo;
that make possible such businesses as Uber and AirBnB, along with
innovative organizational structures and business models such as
Federal Express or container ships (which, after a ten-year legal
battle with trade unions, reduced from days to minutes the time that a
truck&rsquo;s contents would spend at the dockyard before being
transferred to a ship). In many cases, the cost of transacting
concerns the cost of information. As the frontier of knowledge
expands, the slice of information that a given individual can grasp
inevitably becomes a smaller fraction of the whole. Prices become an
increasingly indispensable window to a world of tacit knowledge.</p>

<p>
But technological innovation shocks economies. Formerly profitable
investments become relics of a bygone age and must be liquidated.
Workers get laid off until they find some other way to produce goods
wanted by today&rsquo;s customers. Transitions are tough and
miscalculations abound, even as we grope toward heights made possible
by a given innovation. Innovative ways of lowering transaction cost
spread throughout a community, and failures (including once-useful but
now obsolete innovations) are discarded. More precisely, failures are
discarded if and when decision makers are innovators on the ground,
learning to avoid wasting more of their own money on ideas whose time
has passed.</p>

<p>
Hayek denies that resources will ever be used at theoretical peak
efficiency (1945, 527). Humans being what they are, waste is
ubiquitous. Mistakes are ubiquitous. The &ldquo;marvel&rdquo; of
markets is not that market agents act with exquisite efficiency but
rather that they make mistakes, get burnt, learn fast, and make
corrections. If our customers are not willing to pay what it costs us
to get our product to them, then we are wasting resources. Prices give
us a timely and reliable source of information about this most crucial
question.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, when decision makers are not principals but bureaucrats
in large organizations, they are not subject to this immediate
discipline. Their interest is not in providing a better service so
much as in avoiding budget cuts. If they make a mistake, what cuts
their budget is not the mistake so much as supervisors discovering the
mistake. Bureaucratic structure makes new information a threat that
needs to be suppressed or smothered in propaganda (1944, 126ff,
153ff). Bureaucrats and their expert advisors experience mistakes not
as events from which they need to learn but rather as events that they
need to cover up. The mistakes they make are with other people&rsquo;s
money, so bureaucrats learn to say, when confronted, that their budget
was not large enough, or that things would have been worse if they had
acted
 differently.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 They may even believe what they are saying, but they do not know and
have every incentive to avoid learning.</p>

<h2 id="PlanOrdeSystInfe">3. Planned Orders Are Systematically Inferior</h2>

<p>
If we understand the principles that drive any given system&rsquo;s
logic, we may have a basis for prediction. Thus, it may be predictable
that a population of insects will evolve resistance to a pesticide.
Beyond the question of what we can predict, then, Hayek has a further
and more precise target: however much we can predict, there is a
drastic limit to what we can simply
 <em>decide</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 No one can decide against buyers and sellers responding in
predictable ways to a central plan&rsquo;s perverse incentives, in the
same way that no one can <em>decide</em> against insects evolving
resistant to an insecticide.</p>

<p>
This problem may sound obvious but as Adam Smith observed, it
evidently is not. Technocrats will not see it coming. Hayek quotes
Smith approvingly. The &ldquo;man of system&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great
society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces
upon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the
chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the
hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human
society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own,
altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to
impress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same
direction, the game of human society will go on easily and
harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they
are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the
society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder (Smith
1790, 234).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The system has a logic. Planners cannot change that logic, but they
can decide whether to work with or against it (which Smith regards as
a choice between harmony and misery). Smith holds that planners who
disregard economic logic are deciding in effect to sacrifice their
&ldquo;pawns,&rdquo; something that a person of true benevolence would
not do.</p>

<p>
When Hayek explains the obstacle to effective central planning, his
claim is not merely the Smithian point that information is widely
dispersed and therefore hard to acquire. Rather, it is impossible to
acquire (Hayek 1973, 51). The issue is not computational complexity so
much as information&rsquo;s inherently contextual nature. Prices are
not <em>revealed</em> by ongoing processes of market exchange so much
as continuously <em>created</em> by them. If prices are instead set
periodically by a central planner, rather than instantaneously by
consumers and producers who are the first and typically the only
people to have information in reliable and timely form, prices
inevitably can no longer be creating reliable, timely information
about which offers are being accepted and which are being rejected. As
Hayek notes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a
given system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of
available means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic.
That is, the answer to the question of what is the best use of our
available means is implicit in our assumptions. This, however, is
emphatically not the economic problem which society faces. And the
economic calculus which we have developed to solve this logical
problem, though an important step toward the solution of the economic
problem of society, does not yet provide an answer to it. The reason
for this is that the &ldquo;data&rdquo; from which the economic
calculus starts are never for the whole society &ldquo;given&rdquo; to
a single mind which could work out the implications and can never be
so given (Hayek 1945, 519).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Soviet central planners made decisions by checking prices on
international markets, but suppose planners did not have even that
sort of information. Suppose there is no information about supply and
demand to be had anywhere. Suppose you are a planner, but all you know
is that you face demands for wire and for jewelry. How do you decide
whether to direct factories to make wire out of copper or platinum, or
whether smiths should make jewelry out of gold or silver? How do you
decide who should get silver jewelry and who should get gold? How do
you decide whether anyone at all should get jewelry, as opposed to
reserving all such metals for use as wire?</p>

<p>
When consumers are not paying for what they receive, their demand is
effectively infinite. Inevitably, a central planner&rsquo;s task
becomes one of cost containment. Worse yet, a planner with no measure
of cost has little basis for deciding what should count as containing
cost. If a given ton of steel can make one car or ten refrigerators,
which way of using steel is economical? How does a planner decide
whether to invest in upgrading water supplies or nuclear reactors? If
all you know as a producer is that people are asking for infinitely
more than you can give, then eventually you turn a deaf ear, deliver
your quota, and learn to ignore whether demands from below (from
customers) are being met. The only demands with consequences are
demands from above (that is, what your supervisors demand).</p>

<p>
A central planner could have the world&rsquo;s most powerful computer,
beyond anything imagined when Hayek published &ldquo;Use of
Knowledge&rdquo; in 1945. No computer, however, could solve the
problem that Hayek was trying to articulate. The problem is not lack
of processing power so much as a lack of access to the information in
the first place. That much seems clear enough, but the problem has a
deeper level. The problem is not merely lack of <em>access</em> to
information; rather the information does not exist. There is no truth
about what prices should be, accessible or otherwise, except to the
extent that sellers are learning what customers want, deciding prices
at which they are willing to sell, while buyers are deciding how much
they want to buy at a given price, or (if prevailing norms allow
haggling) deciding on a counter-offer. When this is the process that
culminates in prices, sellers are learning how to provide a range of
affordable services to buyers and buyers are learning what it takes to
finance the provision of such services. This is what prices can be,
and this is how prices can serve a community (1944, 51&ndash;52; see
also Boettke and Candela 2023).</p>

<p>
Hayek says with a thought more characteristic of neoclassical
economists: &ldquo;Only prices determined on the free market will
bring it about that demand equals supply&rdquo; (Hayek 1960, 63).
Price controls&mdash;floors and ceilings&mdash;make buyers and sellers
less able to respond to the signals they would send each other if they
could raise their offer or lower their asking price. If price cannot
rise, then buyers cannot signal producers that demand has increased
and that producers would sell more if they were to increase supply.
And if producers do not increase supply, rising demand results in
shortages rather than economic growth. (See especially Zwolinski 2008
for further elaboration.)<sup> </sup></p>

<p>
By contrast, under central planning, if a product is readily available
on official markets, it must be because it has been over-priced by the
central planner. The only exception occurs when planners are so
inhumanly well-informed or inhumanly lucky that they set a price
exactly where the market would set it if the planner had left it
alone. A more likely result: when the official price is too high,
consumers stop buying. Then producers sound the alarm: no one wants
their product! Central planners respond with price supports, buying an
unwanted product themselves, then giving it away at subsidized prices
to peole (foreign or domestic) who do not want the product at its
official price. But citizens ends up paying the official price anyway,
involuntarily, in the form of the taxes that underwrite the price
supports. As consumers they are thwarted. As taxpayers they are
impoverished (Hayek 1945, 527).</p>

<p>
By contrast, under a regime of free-floating prices, suppose a
manufacturer figures out how to make an &ldquo;epipen&rdquo; that can
save the lives of consumers otherwise at risk of a fatal allergic
reaction to bee stings. Suppose the manufacturer can produce a limited
supply of epipens for a little less than a hundred dollars each, does
so, then proceeds to offer them for sale for a hundred dollars.
Suppose the manufacturer finds buyers lining up by the thousands
wanting to buy the pens, and suppose that there emerges a group of
&ldquo;scalpers&rdquo; willing to stand in line for weeks, who buy all
the pens for a hundred dollars each, then resell the pens for two
hundred dollars, then three hundred, then four, and demand remains
strong. Hayek would predict that if we let the price signals be the
marvels that they are, then other producers will jump in and begin to
manufacture pens for one or two hundred dollars each. Eventually the
demand is met, and the scalpers go away. Meanwhile, new producers
drawn by the spike in profitability invent a new process that enables
them to produce the pens for ninety dollars, then eighty, and again
the price will fall, as competition leads the price signal to track
the falling cost of production. Of course, if we devise a patent or a
licensing scheme or some other way to choking off competition, then
this will not occur. By the same token, if we impose a price ceiling
of a hundred dollars, then no signal is sent to would-be competitors
unless scalpers send that signal via the back market. Or, if some
other constraint makes it impossible to increase the supply, then
prices may drift up toward the limits of a customer&rsquo;s
willingness to pay. Barring this, there are many ways for kings,
legislators, or other planners to interfere, yet price signals, if
left alone, are an incomparably rapid and incomprehensibly vast
generator of information: supply and demand tend to equilibrate, and
to converge on a price in the neighborhood of the cost of production.
To a uniquely reliable degree, a product will tend to end up in a
consumer&rsquo;s hands just in case that particular consumer wants the
product enough to pay what it cost to produce it.</p>

<p>
Although computers cannot solve the problem, Hayek thought radically
dispersed decision making by buyers and sellers observably does solve
the problem, so far as it can be solved. Sellers who charge too much
end up without customers; they learn to be more efficient or else find
some other line of 
 work.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Buyers who want <em>x</em> but
consider it overpriced stay home for a while, waiting for the price to
fall. Then they see <em>x</em> flying off the shelves and learn
something about themselves: namely, they would rather have the product
at that price than not have it at all. To Hayek, only a price
mechanism can process changing information almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>
Ironically, the <em>most</em> efficient thing a central planner can
possibly do is to set a price exactly where it would have been without
the planner&rsquo;s intervention.</p>

<h3 id="TrucBartComm">3.1 Trucking, Bartering, Community</h3>

<p>
Insofar as society is a cooperative venture for mutual advantage,
learning to survive&mdash;not just physically but as full members of a
community&mdash;will involve learning to cooperate. Learning to
cooperate involves learning to become a trading partner. In other
words, cooperation begins with having something to offer: a way of
making people better off.</p>

<p>
Clearly in Smith, who inspired Hayek, but also in Hayek himself, the
driving motivation is not greed or even well-being so much as a
propensity to truck and barter, where this deal-making is not only a
means to an end but somehow also what we do for its own sake, because
making deals is what our kind of social animal was born to do.
Neither, Hayek thought, is the objective for buyers and sellers to
coordinate on a price that a central planner <em>might</em> stumble
on, but to coordinate per se. Mutually satisfying coordination, the
ongoing equilibration of supply and demand, constantly evolving in
response to changing conditions, is itself the achievement. There is
no need for that coordination to be tracking anything beyond itself.
To Hayek, the value we hope to see realized in a marketplace is not
that the correct volume of goods gets exchanged at the correct price.
Rather, the point is trade per se. The valued result is buyers and
sellers responding to each other, becoming more attuned to what people
around them want, and helping to create a community in which their
role in an important one.</p>

<p>
Such sensitivity is good, but there is little that central planners
can do to encourage it. Central planners replace what could be a
complex, decentralized network of interdependence and mutual
responsibility with something more like a society of spokes whose only
connection is to a dominating central distributor at the hub. It is no
substitute for real community.</p>

<h3 id="LawEcolNich">3.2 Law As An Ecological Niche</h3>

<p>
In nature, for biological adaptation to culminate in better-adapted
populations over time, the niche to which a population is adapting
must be relatively stable. Likewise, under a rule of law, the aim of
government is not to win but to provide a stable ecological niche that
enables the game&rsquo;s true players to evolve strategies apt for
success within that niche. Analogously, an elaborate crystal structure
cannot form unless the medium in which crystals form is left
undisturbed. Hayek&rsquo;s ideal is a legal &ldquo;medium&rdquo; of
society, <em>liberal</em> enough to permit creativity, <em>stable</em>
enough to reward creativity, and <em>constraining</em> enough in ways
that steer people toward wealth creation and away from wealth
capture.</p>

<p>
Here, then, in a few sentences, is one way of understanding
Hayek&rsquo;s point. Not everything that happens in an evolving
community is foreseen or intended. Actions have more than one
consequence. They also have more than the intended consequence. This
is especially so when there is more than one decision maker. No one
follows a planner&rsquo;s plan simply because the planner
<em>intends</em> that they do so. People adjust to a planner&rsquo;s
plan in service of their own plans rather than those of the planner,
and the result is too chaotic to be safely predictable. Further, the
rule of law itself is an evolving product of ongoing decision making,
so the framework itself takes a shape not intended by any legislator.
Does this mean that every order is tautologically a spontaneous order?
The answer: it is a universally true empirical generalization, not a
tautology, that every social organization, even a dictatorship, is
<em>partly</em> an ongoing product of ordering processes that are to
some degree spontaneous. However, while the degree to which outcomes
are unintended is a continuum, there remains a point in categorizing
communities as centrally planned versus spontaneous. A central plan is
designed to yield an end-state. A central plan aims to bring about
particular outcomes&mdash;what roles people will play, what they will
achieve in those roles, and what they will win by so achieving. By
contrast, in what we should call spontaneous order, government
provides a stable and known framework of rules, aiming not to realize
a particular outcome so much as to realize a particular process (Hayek
1944, 113). Although this ideal can never be fully achieved in
practice, a government under rule of law acts as referee and provider
of the rule book (Hayek 1960, 114) and operates as much as possible by
an ideal of &ldquo;letting the players play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Is letting the players play good? Necessarily good? Adam Smith might
have said no, as might Hayek. A praiseworthy rule of law&mdash;a
praiseworthy market <em>process</em>&mdash; facilitates mutually
beneficial trade by internalizing externalities, by minimizing
transaction cost (especially when it comes to acquiring information),
by minimizing opportunities to acquire people&rsquo;s goods without
their consent (thereby encouraging people to trade on
agreeable&mdash;thus typically beneficial&mdash;terms), and by being
extremely cautious about trying to do more than that. When the hubris
of central planners leads them to imagine that their mandate is not to
simply let the players play but to pick winners, entrepreneurship
becomes the province of clandestine politics, economies grind to a
halt, and civil society quite generally breaks down.</p>

<p>
Hayek had no particular complaint about providing public education or
the minimal elements of a welfare state, but not because such
institutions are essential, and certainly not because only central
planners can provide such instituions. Hayek would simply have said
that societies providing themselves with basic infrastructure need not
devolve into central planning and thus need not be antithetical to a
free society. Issuing vouchers to subsidize education, for example, or
the purchase of epipens, would distort markets to some extent but not
to the extent that price controls do.</p>

<h2 id="JustImpaPoliEntrWithRest">4. Justice as Impartiality, Politics As Entrepreneurship Without Restraint</h2>

<p>
Hayek, like Adam Smith, theorized about what works rather than what to
do. Neither was a moral theorist in the 20th century sense. (That is,
they did not follow Sidgwick in attempting to articulate
&ldquo;methods of ethics.&rdquo;) That makes Hayek, like Smith, appear
to be a consequentialist of sorts, and yet Hayek&rsquo;s defense of
economic freedom hints at a deontological moral sensibility that
regards the separateness of persons as morally fundamental. Thus, for
example, Hayek says, &ldquo;the test of the justice of a rule is
usually (since Kant) described as that of its
universalizability&rdquo; (Hayek 1969, 168). As John Gray sees it,
Hayek commended the laws of justice &ldquo;as being the indispensable
condition for the promotion of the general welfare&rdquo; but Hayek
held, at the same time, that &ldquo;an impartial concern for the
general welfare is itself one of the demands of
universalizability&rdquo; (Gray 1984, 65).</p>

<p>
In service of the overall project of fostering the general welfare,
the point of law and legislation is to craft a framework within which
a market order will be a history of pareto-improving
 trades.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 A primary role of law and (when necessary) legislation is to narrow
people&rsquo;s options so as to limit opportunities to get rich at
other people&rsquo;s
 expense.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 So long as the rule of law can internalize external cost and thereby
steer innovation in mutually beneficial rather than parasitic
directions, an evolving order will be an order of rising
prosperity.</p>

<p>
No such confidence is warranted under a central planner. In a planned
order, even astute and conscientious decisions by men of system are
damaging in a particular way. Namely, to the extent that men of system
become micro-managers, they are players rather than umpires. If
bureaucrats start playing the game&mdash;responding to ephemeral
events with centralized fine tuning&mdash;then even if they play as
cleverly as bureaucrats could possibly play, the fact remains that in
consequence, the dispersed and tacit knowledge of ordinary buyers and
sellers ends up on the sidelines watching. People who would have been
innovators (or at least whistle-blowers) become mere spectators,
waiting to see what the plan is going to be.</p>

<p>
Government provides the framework for interaction. Ideally, as
mentioned, government operates only within a stable and known
framework of rules (Hayek 1944, 113). This is Hayek&rsquo;s vision of
good government. Is it realistic? Could the kind of politician who has
enough ambition to do what it takes to acquire government power
realistically be expected to be content with subsequently serving as
an impartial referee&mdash;with no agenda of his or her own? Hayek saw
the rule of law as the market&rsquo;s exogenous ecological niche, and
thought that this niche, that is, the rule of law, must be properly
constructed if the process of spontaneous order is be a good thing.
However, Hayek seemingly came to doubt there could be any such thing
as properly constructed rule of law. Why? Because law-making is a
process driven by a logic more or less indistinguishable from market
process <em>except</em> that benefits to legislators of their
law-making are concentrated while costs are dispersed across the
population, that is to say, cost is systematically externalized, and
at best only dimly understood even after the
 fact.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This is not only a moral hazard but an information problem. A piece of
legislation may be thousands of pages. No one <em>intends</em> the
bill as a whole. Indeed, there is no overall point to the bill, known
or otherwise, because prior to passage literally no one knows what is
in the bill. No one has even read more than a few pages of it, not
even the hundreds of legislators who each added a few pages of
earmarks as the price of securing their vote. After passage, it will
fall to unelected operatives of the executive branch&rsquo;s
regulatory agencies to mull over the bill&rsquo;s inevitable
contradictions and decide what to count as complying with the
legislation&rsquo;s overall intent.</p>

<p>
Common law, by contrast, is a body of practice and tradition. It
sometimes needs to be supplemented by legislation. Crucially, however,
by virtue of passing the test of time as a device for settling
disputes, common law will not be mere prejudice or superstition. On
the contrary, it will have a decisive advantage over ongoing
legislation. Namely, it will have become what people expect. It will
be shaping what people expect from each other. It will have become
part of the plans of the community&rsquo;s members, part of what they
take into account, part of their basis for knowing what to do. Hayek
never doubted the need for legislation but lamented our propensity to
be oblivious to its inevitably unintended consequences and unseen cost
(Hayek 1973, 86).</p>

<p>
Moreover, the liberty thus undermined is political as well as
economic, as a society&rsquo;s energy increasingly shifts away from a
positive-sum economic arena and into an arguably zero-sum arena of
wrestling for political power to control the agenda of never-ending
legislation aimed at undoing the mistakes, misdeeds, and disagreeable
visions of political rivals.</p>

<h2 id="HayeAgaiJust">5. Hayek Against Justice</h2>

<p>
To Hayek, it matters far more that the law be a framework for
coordination than exactly what the coordination points are (Hayek
1960, 118). Hayek could see that coordination points have distributive
implications, leading Hayek to lament our tendency to evaluate
distributions by asking whether they are just. Yet, Hayek concedes, at
least in principle, the legitimacy of a minimum income or welfare
safety net of some sort. See Tebble (2015) for a sympathetic yet acute
argument that this concession on Hayek&rsquo;s part is a &ldquo;fatal
ambivalence.&rdquo; In fact, Tebble argues, Hayek&rsquo;s repudiation
of social justice leaves him with no room to make any such concession
(but for a contrary view, see Yadav, 2023).</p>

<p>
Hayek says, &ldquo;one of my chief preoccupations for more than 10
years&rdquo; has been coming to terms with the idea that social
justice is a mirage (Hayek 1978b,
 57).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 By <em>social</em> justice, Hayek means distributive justice, and
more specifically what Nozick called end-state principles of
distributive justice, which treat justice as about engineering
outcomes rather than managing commercial traffic.</p>

<p>
Why would justice so conceived be a mirage? Hayek says, &ldquo;there
can be no distributive justice where no one distributes&rdquo; (Hayek
1978b, 58 or 1976, 68&ndash;69). In Hayek&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;considerations of justice provide no justification for
&lsquo;correcting&rsquo; the results of the market&rdquo; (1969, 175).
So long as traders are voluntarily making pareto-superior moves, there
is nothing else that can be said or needs to be said by way of
justification.</p>

<p>
Why would Hayek resist applying conceptions of justice and injustice
to situations where no one distributes? What is haunting Hayek here is
not the idea that one person might be more deserving than another, but
rather that a &ldquo;merit czar&rdquo; might presume to intervene to
correct markets that fail to give people what a czar thinks they
deserve. Merit czars presume not only to make sure that traffic is
moving smoothly and therefore every driver is getting a turn; they
also want to make sure every driver is heading in the right direction
(Schmidtz, 2023, 17).</p>

<p>
Fearing the invitation to tyranny, Hayek argues not that markets are
just but that they are not the kind of thing that can be just or
unjust. Where no one distributes, there may be something lamentable
about the result, but the result will not be unjust in the way that
<em>engineering</em> such a result would be. Outcomes that would have
been unjust if <em>deliberately imposed</em> (such as being born with
a cleft palate) sometimes simply happen. Rawls seems to agree with
Hayek when he says, &ldquo;The natural distribution is neither just
nor unjust; nor is it unjust that persons are born into society at
some particular position. These are simply natural facts&rdquo;
(Rawls, 1971, 102). Rawls, however, immediately adds what Hayek would
call a non sequitur: &ldquo;What is just and unjust is the way that
institutions deal with these facts&rdquo; (ibid), where resigning
ourselves to the facts is the paradigmatically unjust way of dealing
with them (ibid). If Rawls is right to deem the natural distribution
neither just nor unjust, then when institutions &ldquo;deal with
natural facts,&rdquo; they are, to Hayek, not undoing wrongs.</p>

<p>
Hayek would never deny that cleft palates are bad. He would not resign
himself to letting cleft palates go unrepaired. Hayek would, however,
insist that if a problem is not an injustice, then fixing it cannot,
contra Rawls, count as rectifying an injustice. If we feel called upon
to help children with cleft palates, it will be because having a cleft
palate is bad, not because having a cleft palate is unjust. When we
help, we are not fixing an <em>improper distribution</em> of cleft
plates. We are simply fixing cleft palates. When we respond to the
problem, we take a stand not against injustice but against blameless
suffering (Hayek 1976, 87).</p>

<p>
If there is no injustice needing rectification, then the improvement
we have a right to strive for is pareto-improvement, or in any case,
improvement by mutually acceptable means. By contrast, if (contra
Rawls) the natural distribution were unjust, that would open the field
to the avalanche of zero-sum and negative-sum moves that people feel
invited to impose on each other under the guise of rectifying
injustice. The right to make such moves with other people&rsquo;s
money becomes an overwhelmingly lucrative political football, luring a
society&rsquo;s entrepreneurial talent into politics, where instead of
creating new social capital, entrepreneurs spend their time inventing
clever new ways of capturing it. Hayek would never deny the plain fact
that people can and often do treat other people&rsquo;s possessions as
a political football, or the plain fact that people never tire of
inventing theories according to which they are philosopher-kings who
have a mandate to do so. Hayek is observing the actual empirical cost
of never-ending political football. Hayek seems to worry that our
sense of justice can make it harder for us to live together, and make
progress together. It can make us feel righteous when we seek to use
political power against fellow citizens who see things
differently.</p>

<p>
In that respect, Hayek was profoundly a <em>constitutional</em>
democrat. He understood that a free society does what it can to take
the spectre of a tyranny of the majority off the table. In ramping
down the threat that shifting majorities can pose to minorities,
constitutional democracy has the potential to make politics an
alternative to war rather than a form of it.</p>

<p>
As Hayek knew, he was profoundly at odds with much thinking about
social justice. He expected to be vilified (1944, vii) and he was. He
was as responsive to misfortune as anyone, and seemed to embrace the
same package of duties to children as any social justice theorist
would. Yet, he also saw the free world at a crossroads between a
defeasible presumption that normal adults have agreed to share each
other&rsquo;s fate (Rawls, 1971, 102) and a defeasible presumption
that normal adults have the right and the responsibility to play the
cards that nature has dealt.</p>

<p>
What Hayek saw as a mirage was not justice as such so much as a
particular way of conceiving justice. Hayek was on board with justice
as normal adults striving to live well, free from gratuitous
interference by those whose conception of justice seems to license
them to treat fellow citizens as mere means.</p>

<p>
In Hayek&rsquo;s mind, we should want a system of justice to be a
framework for avoiding and resolving conflict that leaves us all with
mutual expectations with which we can be at peace and which help us
stay out of each other&rsquo;s way as we each set a course for our
individually chosen destinations. If we operated by end-state
principles of justice (Nozick 1974), we would need to justify every
move that bore on how goods would be distributed in the evolving
end-state, which is to say we would need to justify virtually every
trade we contemplate, which would gridlock us rather than facilitate
our inventing new ways of making ourselves more valuable to the people
around us.</p>

<p>
On Hayek&rsquo;s conception, no principle of justice would pick our
destination for us. Neither would it require us to justify our
destination to others. Indeed, there is a premium on people not
<em>needing</em> to justify themselves.</p>

<p>
Perhaps Hayek is overreacting here. In any case, some philosophical
interpretation is unavoidable, but arguably this accounts for
Hayek&rsquo;s seemingly dogmatic dismissal of end-state principles of
justice. For reasons reminiscent of Nozick&rsquo;s, Hayek finds such
principles unaffordable and incompatible with autonomous agents
minding their own business in a free society. Indeed such principles
make it hard to imagine what could count as minding one&rsquo;s own
business. In that respect, in trying to carve out a coherent realm of
individual autonomy, Hayek paradigmatically is, as he often claimed, a
liberal, not conservative.</p>

<h3 id="InpuOutpWhatItMeanEcon">5.1 Input, Output, and What It Means To Economize</h3>

<p>
Merit, as Hayek understands it, concern the inputs one brings to a
process, not the output. (Hayek 1960, 94). Hayek speaks as if merit
has everything to do with trying hard, and nothing to do with
achieving excellence. In Hayek&rsquo;s mind, nothing good can come of
that. In a free society, by contrast, we are rewarded for our output,
not our input (Hayek 1960, 98). Among Hayek&rsquo;s core concerns is
the &ldquo;mirage&rdquo; of thinking that justice requires rewarding
people for supplying inputs, not for supplying outputs. Admittedly, if
we leave customers to their own devices, output is what they will
reward, which is what Hayek wants.</p>

<p>
By the same token, when customers left to their own devices choose to
reward us for our output, their behavior plainly is not altogether
insensitive to merit. The tendency of market rewards to track merit
will be merely a tendency, but meritocracy being merely a tendency is
not the same as meritocracy being a mirage. A key element of a
system&rsquo;s success in promoting prosperity will be that in
rewarding excellent output, customers are at the same time rewarding
the hard work, courage, alertness, and commitment that makes for
excellence. To be sure, customers will be rewarding luck too, but
typically not sheer random fluke. Customers reward entrepreneurs for
what they do with their lucky breaks, not for the bare fact of having
had lucky
 breaks.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Hayek says we want to economize on merit (Hayek 1960, 96). This is
true. But even so, saying we economize on hard work is another way of
saying hard work is important. It is not evidence that we are in the
grip of a mirage when we imagine that we have reason to reward the
hard work and other dimensions of merit that have robust tendencies to
culminate in excellent output.</p>

<p>
In sum, a merit theorist would be well-advised to concede to Hayek
that rewards ought to track actual performance, not inner merit.
Customers can judge your product&rsquo;s merits without needing to
know whether you were lucky. The crucial point is that wherever it is
more rewarding to work hard than not, more rewarding to do excellent
work than not, more rewarding to be alert to customer needs than not,
a system is tending to reward the right things. In that system, output
will tend to be increasingly excellent over time. Products will tend
to work as advertized. People will tend to prosper, and will tend to
aim at being meritorious to boot.</p>

<h3 id="RighDist">5.2 The Right To Distribute</h3>

<p>
As noted, Hayek&rsquo;s critique of social justice is more
specifically a critique of centrally planned distribution according to
merit. Hayek thinks a merit czar would be intolerable. However, when
Hayek rejects the idea of a merit czar, what bothers him most is the
idea that justice requires central planning, not the idea that it
would be good to have a way of rewarding merit. If Hayek is right that
there is no place for centralized decisions about meritoriousness in a
good society, then, contra Hayek, the implication is not that merit
doesn&rsquo;t matter but precisely that it does (Hayek 1976, 64). The
problem with a merit system, to Hayek, is that if you cannot prove you
deserve <em>G</em>, that licenses merit czars to redistribute from the
less to the more deserving. The point is crucial not because it
refutes Hayek but because it reveals the precise nature of
Hayek&rsquo;s real concern. Hayek&rsquo;s core concern is not the
mirage of thinking merit <em>does</em> matter, but the mirage of
thinking entitlement
 <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="FairPrac">5.3 Fair Practices</h3>

<p>
Note the similarity between Hayek&rsquo;s view and the view expressed
by John Rawls in &ldquo;Two Concepts of Rules&rdquo; (1955). Both
Hayek and Rawls understood, as few have, what is involved in a
<em>practice</em> having utility. To use Rawls&rsquo;s example, the
practice of baseball is defined by procedural rules rather than by
end-state principles of distributive justice. To have a practice at
all, we must be dogmatic (Hayek would say) about how many strikes a
batter should get.</p>

<p>
Imagine changing the concept of the game so that the umpire&rsquo;s
job is to make sure the good guys win. What would that do to the
players? What would become of their striving? The result would not be
baseball. If we end up with a game where the umpire is making sure the
annointed team wins, allocating extra opportunities to the hometown
hero as required &ldquo;so that we get the desired solution&rdquo;
(Rawls, 1971, 141), then the players are sitting on the sidelines
watching, hoping to be annointed. Hayek&rsquo;s insight (and
Rawls&rsquo;s insight at that stage of his career) is that genuine
fairness is not about making sure prizes are properly
 distributed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Fairness is not even about making sure outcomes are not unduly
influenced by morally arbitrary factors such as how well the players
played or how hard they worked to prepare themselves. True fairness is
about being impartial, nonpartisan&mdash;proverbially, &ldquo;letting
the players play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
One of Hayek&rsquo;s problems with the kind of justice that amounts to
making sure the good guys win is that it tends to turn society&rsquo;s
basic structure into a political football, which tends to squander
gains from trade. To Hayek, again, true justice is about letting the
players play, to the same extent that pareto-improving economic
coordination is about letting the players
 play.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="JustPric">5.4 Just Price</h3>

<p>
Whether we realize gains requires only that we trade on mutually
agreeable terms, not that we trade at any particular price. Thus, we
don&rsquo;t want to focus on price when the wealth of nations has
everything to do with gains from trade and nothing to do with
price.</p>

<p>
Indeed, Hayek observes, being obsessed with just price makes trade
less likely, which results in failing to realize some of the
cooperative surplus. Much of Hayek&rsquo;s aversion to justice stems
from a sense that (for thousands of years) talk of justice has had a
way of turning into talk of just <em>price</em> (Hayek 1976, 73). This
makes prices appear morally important, which to Hayek is a
 mirage.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Of Adam Smith&rsquo;s butchers and bakers, Hayek says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Precisely because they were interested only in who would offer the
best price for their products, they reached persons wholly unknown to
them, whose standard of life they thereby enhanced much more than they
could have that of their neighbors&hellip; (Hayek 1978b, 60).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s dismissal of social justice as a <em>mirage</em> is a
gratuitously tendentious way of packaging his actual view. However,
Hayek&rsquo;s motive is clear: namely his dread of the prospect of
licensing a justice czar to intervene to make sure prices are fair,
thus derailing the wealth-creating spontaneous trading of a free
society within the rule of law. Paraphrasing Michael Munger (2013),
the closest thing we have to an omniscient social planner are the twin
forces of supply and demand, but those forces speak to people through
changing prices. When the state makes it a crime to charge what the
market will bear, that can set in motion a process that makes it
illegal for insulin users to respond to a power failure by outbidding
beer drinkers for insulin-preserving ice as the supply of ice (in the
absence of refrigeration) runs short.</p>

<p>
In a case like that, the law has struck dumb the only voice that can
give people reliable, timely advice on how they need to allocate
resources right now. This is the ultimate concern throughout
Hayek&rsquo;s writings and underlying his otherwise ill-fitting
polemic against social justice. To Hayek, it is a mirage to think
fairness has anything to do with stopping the price mechanism from
notifying us about where our services are most in need.</p>

<p>
Hayek never doubts that we sometimes need legislation, but thinks the
aim of legislation should be to make things better, not fairer; to
make things more productive, not more level; to channel innovative
thinking away from wealth <em>capture</em> and toward wealth creation.
Hayek in fact endorses norms of pure procedural justice, and would
agree that there is such a thing as fairness. True fairness, he would
say, is about letting players play on a more or less level playing
field but it is not about making sure everyone gets the same prize.
Hayek saw a free society as one where people stand or fall on the
basis of how well they perform, not how hard they try&mdash;what they
produce, not what they intend.</p>

<h2 id="AustSchoOpenSoci">6. The Austrian School and the Open Society</h2>

<p>
Hayek grew up in a glorious age of Viennese culture only to see it
evaporate before his eyes with WWI, the Great Depression, the rise of
socialism and fascism, WWII, and the Cold War. Hayek fought in WWI. He
was among those who left Vienna in the early 1930s never to return. He
experienced WWII in his adopted home of Great Britain (Caldwell and
Klausinger, 2022). Like others of his generation, these experiences
were pivotal. He saw totalitarianism distorting science and
scholarship, as did two of his philosophical friends: Michael Polanyi
and Karl Popper. Despite their differences, Hayek drew inspiration
from and helped promote the work of Polanyi and Popper. (See Lewis
2016, Gaus 2021) Totalitarian systems inevitably end up being hostile
to the critical attitude at the heart of scientific inquiry, and
Hayek, Polanyi and Popper saw them for what they were from the start.
In their separate ways, they sought to articulate and defend the
science of a free society.</p>

<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s economic education at the University of Vienna was
within the law faculty. Hayek&rsquo;s degrees were in political
science, jurisprudence, and economics. His dissertation work was on
the technical topic of the imputation of value in a capital-using
economy, and his early professional work focused on monetary theory
and business cycle statistics. As with other scholars of the Austrian
School of Economics, the institutional framework within which economic
activity takes place was never far from the foreground, and was not to
be obscured by technical economic analysis. Law, politics, and social
norms all are critical to the way Austrian economists see economic
forces playing out in the real world.</p>

<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s growing frustration with the conversation among elite
economists during the 1930s and 1940s was born out his utter surprise
that the institutional wisdom passed down from classical political
economists to the early neoclassical economists was being lost. He
wanted to know why. He explored the rise of formalism and an emerging
shift toward macro-theory emphasizing relationships between aggregate
variables unconnected to individual choice. These shifts were
technical in part, but Hayek saw the technicality masking (and partly
driven by) a deeper philosophical shift from seeing the human
condition as complex to seeing it as as a relatively simple machine
that a good mechanic could tinker with and fine-tune. The idea of
studying the human condition as a complex spontaneous order came to
seem unscientific. Thus, in &ldquo;The Use of Knowledge in
Society&rdquo;, Hayek says maximizing and equilibrium models of
mathematical economics &ldquo;habitually disregard&rdquo; essential
dimensions of the phenomena to be explained, and in so doing
&ldquo;mislead some of our leading thinkers&rdquo; (1944, 91).</p>

<p>
Critical to the Austrian examination of the competitive market process
is the primacy placed on property rights, relative prices, and
profit-and-loss accounting. The emphasis on institutional
infrastructure informed Austrian perspectives on price theory and the
market system, on monetary and capital theory, and on obstacles to
socialist economic planning in particular and interventionism more
generally. To Hayek, the idea of prices without property is a grand
illusion, and efforts to regulate economic activity are plagued by
unintended consequences and unforeseen costs.</p>

<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s concern in <em>The Counter-Revolution of Science</em>
was the wrong turn in the history and philosophy of ideas that was
confusing a generation of scholars and public servants about the
social sciences, institutions of liberalism, and principles of
justice. His sustained explorations of legal philosophy and political
theory sought to counter excessive formalism, excessive aggregation,
and a na&iuml;ve empiricism that in his mind conspired to produce the
intellectual dead-end of scientism: that is, an inappropriate and
uncritical application of the methods of the natural sciences to the
problems of social science.</p>

<h3 id="Subj">6.1 Subjectivism</h3>

<p>
As a student of the Austrian School of Economics, Hayek was both a
subjectivist and a marginalist in his approach to studying human
decision making. The value of goods and services inheres in the
judgment of the individual chooser, not in the goods and services as
such. Neither are prices posted in the market merely a summation of
costs of production. Consider that owners of gas stations may hike
gasoline&rsquo;s retail price upon hearing news of a supply problem in
the Middle East. The news obviously does not affect how much they paid
for gas already in their storage tanks. However, it does affect what
it is likely to cost them to restock as current supplies run out.
Retail customers see the hike as gouging because they are oblivious to
the fact that revenue from current sales has to cover the purchase of
future supply, so vendors have to set current retail price with a view
to future wholesale prices.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, when Hayek calls valuation subjective, valuing may
require guesswork but it is not merely a matter of opinion or taste.
Rather, he is talking about prices as reflecting distributed and
situated perspectival awareness of reality. &ldquo;To employ a useful
metaphor,&rdquo; Hayek argued, &ldquo;while in the world of nature we
look from the outside, we look at society from the inside; while, as
far as nature is concerned, our concepts are about the facts and have
to be adapted to the facts, in the world of society at least some of
the most familiar concepts are the stuff from which the world is
made&rdquo; (1948, 76). We are what we study.
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s mentor, Ludwig Mises, stated the argument as follows in
his treatise of economics, <em>Human Action</em> (1949, 92):
&ldquo;Economics is not about things and tangible material objects; it
is about men, their meanings and actions. Goods, commodities, and
wealth are all functions of human meaning and conduct. He who wants to
deal with them must not look at the external world; he must search for
them in the meaning of acting man.&rdquo; A favorite example among
Austrian School economists was to imagine a scientist from Mars
studying the New York subway. Our scientific Martian observes bodies
and boxes at 8am. The boxes swallow the bodies and move. At 5:00pm,
boxes return to the same places and bodies are disgorged. The Martial
observer may develop a theory of boxes and bodies and offer
predictions. But can our observer truly understand the observed
phenomena without acknowledging that the observed bodies are moving
purposively? The point is that, rather than seeing boxes and bodies,
we understand the just-mentioned patterns as people commuting to work.
Fritz Machlup was capturing this idea when he penned an essay under
the title: &ldquo;What if Matter Could Talk?&rdquo; The social
sciences are indeed scientific inquiry, but the subject of study is
radically complex. To study the human condition is not to be studying
inert pawns with no principle of motion of their own but to instead be
studying self-conscious originators of plans and purposes. Economic
science begins with purposeful human action. As social scientists we
can interpret human action in terms of beliefs, desires, and
intentions.</p>

<h3 id="Comp">6.2 Complexity</h3>

<p>
The Austrian School of Economics also emphasized the passage of time
and uncertainty inherent in human decision making as part of the
complexity of the economic order. The emphasis on complexity is not
new to the Viennese economists. It can be seen at the beginning of
<em>The Wealth of Nations</em> in Adam Smith&rsquo;s discussion of
division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale culminating
in the reliable availability of such mundane things as a
worker&rsquo;s woolen coat. The number of exchanges, Smith states,
exceeds all computation. To this computational complexity, the
Austrian School added the idea of ceaseless change that requires
constant adaptation and adjustment to shifting circumstances,
including changes in tastes, technology and resource availability.
Menger and Bohm-Bawerk developed an understanding of price theory and
the market system that Mises and Hayek extended by arguing that a
proper object of economic theory is not efficiency properties of
end-states so much as adaptive and learning aspects of the market
process.</p>

<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s intellectual adversaries shifted somewhat in the second
half of his career. German Historicism and Collectivist Positivism
were no longer the animating forces they were in the first half of the
20th century. Logical positivism was also transformed. To Hayek,
however, a failure to come to grips with the social world&rsquo;s
essential complexity was an enduring cost of the scientism latent in
those traditions. Thus, Hayek&rsquo;s methodological writings in the
1960s and 1970s tend to stress not subjectivism and the human sciences
so much as differences between the sciences of simple phenomena versus
the sciences of essential complexity.</p>

<h3 id="ContViewHaye">6.3 Contemporary Views of Hayek</h3>

<p>
To Hayek, markets have no telos. A market has no particular objective.
It has no intention. It is merely an arena in which goals are pursued
within market constraints, which is to say that market transactions
involve buying, selling, choosing, negotiating, settling, and
ultimately consenting. Amartya Sen (1992) argues contra Hayek that
even under ideal conditions market outcomes are not necessarily just
outcomes. The deeper and more interesting underlying disagreement here
is whether justice pertains to the market process or to the market
outcome. It is &ldquo;justice as outcome&rdquo; that Hayek sees as a
mirage, not &ldquo;justice as process.&rdquo; However, Sen is not
merely talking past Hayek here, because Sen also sees Hayek as
underestimating the role that public institutions play in cultivating
capabilities. Phillip Pettit (1997) argues that Hayek does not pay
sufficient attention to using institutional safeguards to protect
against relations of domination. Spontaneous order, according to
Pettit, does not guarantee freedom from domination as reflected in
corporate power, concentrations of wealth and exploitation of labor.
Hayek is adamant that outcomes are not the kind of thing that can
be guaranteed, but here, too, Pettit is not merely talking past Hayek
because Pettit's critique can be interpreted as a critique of the
market process as much as the market outcome. Elizabeth Anderson
(2017) considers how market-based hierarchies undermine workplace
democracy. The capitalist workplace, according to Anderson, is a form
of private government where the workers have little autonomy or
voice. As such, the spontaneous order that Hayek celebrates, in
practice fails to respect the democratic values of equality and
participation. It seems likely that Hayek would have some sympathy for
this concern.  For people to be free, according to Hayek, is for there
to be a limit to what the Other is at liberty to do to them, even when
the Other is a majority.</p>

<p>
More recently, Daniel Luban (2020) has argued that an emerging order
is not guaranteed to be just or desirable. Hayek should and would
acknowledge that caste systems and institutions of slavery have
evolved by a process that was spontaneous in some respect, and
needless to say Hayek denounced them (1944, 10).  One might ask
whether Hayek thought that there is something in the very idea of
spontaneous order that is inherently justifying; or, rather, did he
think that there is something in the very idea of imposed order that
stands in need of justification? Clearly, Hayek thought the latter,
although Luban finds Hayek&rsquo;s epistemic critique of
constructivism to be overstated. Ben Jackson (2020) similarly argues
that Hayek&rsquo;s critique of social justice does not necessarily
follow from Hayek&rsquo;s own economic analysis. In particular,
spontaneous order does not produce a level playing field. Jackson also
sees Hayek as underestimating the role of the state in making possible
modern economic growth and development. But, as noted in 
 <a href="#AustSchoOpenSoci">Section 6</a>
 above, Hayek was influenced by living through times when centralized
government power was used to perpetrate genocidal horror.</p>
