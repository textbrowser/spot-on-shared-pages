<h1>Samuel Clarke</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Apr 5, 2003; substantive revision Mon Jul 29, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Samuel Clarke (1675&ndash;1729) was the most influential British
metaphysician and philosophical theologian in the generation between
Locke and Berkeley, and only Shaftesbury rivals him in ethics. In all
three areas he was critical of Hobbes, Spinoza, and Toland.</p>

<p>
Clarke defended natural religion against the view that nature
constitutes a self-sufficient system, and he defended revealed
religion against deism. Deeply influenced by Newton, Clarke was
critical of Descartes&rsquo;s metaphysics of space and body because of
the experimental evidence for Newtonian doctrines of space and body
and because he believed Descartes&rsquo;s identifying body with
extension and removing final causes from nature had furthered
irreligion and led to Spinozism. Through his association with Newton,
Clarke was a leading voice on the interpretation and implications of
Newton&rsquo;s project. Newton himself seemed to endorse publicly the
fundamentals of Clarke&rsquo;s interpretation in the revisions to the
<em>Principia</em> and by letting Clarke respond to Leibniz&rsquo;s
charges against the low state of philosophy in England.</p>

<p>
In what follows, we use &ldquo;W&rdquo; as an abbreviation to cite
passages from the four-volume <em>The Works</em>, edited posthumously
by Benjamin Hoadly. Two recent editions of Clarke&rsquo;s major works
are more widely available and thus cited here as well: &ldquo;D&rdquo;
for passages in <em>A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God
and Other Writings</em> in Vailati (1998), and &ldquo;CC&rdquo; for
passages in <em>The Correspondence of Samuel Clarke and Anthony
Collins</em> (Uzgalis (ed.) 2011). References to the Leibniz-Clarke
correspondence (available in many print and online editions) include
the letter and section number preceded by an &ldquo;L&rdquo; for
Leibniz and &ldquo;C&rdquo; for Clarke (e.g., L 1.4 refers to
Leibniz&rsquo;s first letter, section four). For accompanying material
contained in Gregory Brown&rsquo;s new edition <em>The
Leibniz-Caroline-Clarke Correspondence</em> (2023), references include
&ldquo;LCC&rdquo; followed by the number assigned by Gregory Brown
(e.g., LCC 95 refers to Caroline&rsquo;s letter to Leibniz that is
dated to December 1715, which accompanied Clarke&rsquo;s second
latter); &ldquo;Brown 2023&rdquo; refers to his introduction.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<h3 id="Biography">1.1 Biography</h3>

<p>
Samuel Clarke was born on October 11, 1675, in Norwich, England to
Edward Clarke (a cloth merchant, alderman, and representative in
Parliament) and Hannah, daughter of Samuel Parmenter, a merchant
(Hoadly 1730, i). He took his B.A. degree at Cambridge in 1695 by
defending Newton&rsquo;s views, which were not yet widely accepted.
His oral defense &ldquo;suprized the Whole Audience, both for the
Accuracy of Knowledge, and Clearness of Expression, that appeared
through the Whole&rdquo; (Hoadly 1730, iii-iv). His tutor, Sir John
Ellis, a Cartesian, apparently encouraged Clarke to provide a new
annotated Latin translation of Rohault&rsquo;s <em>Treatise of
Physics</em>. The 1697 translation included Clarke&rsquo;s Newtonian
notes that criticized Rohault&rsquo;s Cartesian text. The
edition&rsquo;s success rapidly expanded the understanding of
Newtonian physics, and later editions became the standard physics
textbook in England and the American colonies, creating a
&ldquo;Trojan horse horse for Newton&rsquo;s physics&rdquo;
(Sch&uuml;ller 2023, 6). In that same year, Clarke befriended William
Whiston, who probably introduced Clarke into the Newtonian circle.
These early years show Clarke&rsquo;s interest in theology as well; he
published <em>Three practical essays on baptism, confirmation, and
repentance</em> (1699), <em>A Paraphrase on the Four Evangelists</em>
(1701&ndash;1702), and <em>Some Reflections on that Part of a Book
called Amyntor</em> (1699), a response to John Toland&rsquo;s critique
of the New Testament canon. These all demonstrate Clarke&rsquo;s early
interest in &ldquo;primitive Christianity&rdquo; (Christianity as
practiced and believed in its first two hundred years), which would be
central to his theological vision and would lead to the confrontations
over the doctrine of the trinity in the 1710s.</p>

<p>
The middle years of his career mark his greatest philosophical
contributions, beginning with the Boyle lectures that he delivered in
1704 and 1705. The first, an attempt to prove the existence of God,
along with all divine attributes, was published as <em>A Demonstration
of the Being and Attributes of God</em> (1705) and the second, a
continuation intended to establish all fundamental moral truths and
most religious doctrine, as <em>A discourse concerning the
unchangeable obligations of natural religion, and the truth and
certainty of the Christian revelation</em> (1706). They both went
through many editions and were often published together. These
lectures, established by Robert Boyle to promote natural religion
based on the latest scientific developments, were closely watched, and
Clarke became one of the most well known philosophers in England. The
Boyle lectures, especially Clarke&rsquo;s, were crucial to spreading
Newton&rsquo;s views. As Margaret Jacob (1977, 2) has convincingly
argued, &ldquo;Without these sermons, Newton&rsquo;s system of the
world would have remained relatively unknown, and possibly even
feared, by an educated and literate public on both sides of the
Channel which could not have begun to understand the mathematical
intricacies of the <em>Principia</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s association with Newton became official when he
translated the <em>Opticks</em> into Latin in 1706. In the meantime,
he had been introduced to Queen Anne, who made him one of her
chaplains in 1706, and three years later he was elevated to the
rectory of St. James&rsquo;s, Westminster. After the Hanoverian
accession, Clarke developed a close relationship with Caroline of
Ansbach, the Princess of Wales and future queen. His prominence as a
philosopher drew him into a series of very public exchanges of
letters. The most notable of these were the letters to Anthony Collins
(1707&ndash;1708) and the letters to Leibniz (1715&ndash;1716) (see
below).</p>

<p>
In the later years of his life, Clarke published popular works of
theology, notable translations of Caesar, and a royally appointed
translation of the <em>Iliad</em>. Each of his major publications went
through multiple editions, often with substantial revision. He died in
1729 after a very short illness, consistent with a stroke (Sykes 1729,
10). He was survived by his wife Katherine and five of his seven
children. Clarke was described as polite, vivacious with his friends,
and fond of playing cards.</p>

<h3 id="AuthCorrLeib">1.2 Authorship in the Correspondence with Leibniz</h3>

<p>
Before Caroline of Ansbach became the Princess of Wales, she was
tutored by Leibniz. Leibniz did not join her in England, and they
corresponded across the channel. In one of these letters he attacked
prominent views in England that Leibniz considered dangerous to
natural religion. After mentioning materialism and Lockean doubts
about the soul, Leibniz chastises Newton twice. (Newton and Leibniz
had sparred earlier over the priority of discovery of the calculus.)
Clarke, who with Newton was attending Caroline&rsquo;s court, came to
Newton&rsquo;s defense, but not to Locke&rsquo;s defense, because,
according to Caroline, &ldquo;Neither Dr. Clarke nor Newton wants to
profess to be of Mr. Locke&rsquo;s sect&rdquo; (LCC 89). A series of
five letters passed through Caroline between Leibniz and Clarke over a
wide range of issues. Caroline is significant not only for her
contributions to framing the debate for each correspondent but also as
an important context for understanding the letters (Meli 1999).
Leibniz tries to maintain Caroline&rsquo;s commitment to his system,
perhaps even by framing issues in ways &ldquo;Caroline could be
expected to understand and care about&rdquo; (Brown 2023, lxvii),
while Newton and the more sociable Clarke try to convert her with
arguments and experimental demonstrations in person. She continued to
challenge Clarke and pledge loyalty to Leibniz until his death, but
starting around the time of the third letter, it seems that Clarke had
won her over at least to the existence of the vacuum, which would be
difficult to maintain without accepting the rest of the
Clarkean-Newtonian picture (LCC 119; Brown 2004, 93&ndash;98).</p>

<p>
Today the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is Clarke&rsquo;s most often
read work. Until the new edition by Gregory Brown (2023), it was
usually published without the accompanying letters to and from
Caroline. There has long been a dispute over Newton&rsquo;s role in
the authorship of the letters. Leibniz suspected and Caroline
confirmed that Clarke&rsquo;s letters &ldquo;are not written without
the advice of Chevalier Newton&rdquo; (LCC 95; Alexander 1956, 189 and
193; Brewster 1855, 287&ndash;288). Since then, scholarly opinion has
ranged from Newton&rsquo;s ghostwriting all the letters himself
(Koyr&eacute; and Cohen 1961, 560ff) to Clarke writing the letters and
merely showing them to Newton to make sure there was no disagreement
over the scientific information (Vailati 1997, 4&ndash;5). This point
is not easily decidable, in part because Newton and Clarke were
neighbors and thus almost no correspondence survives between them,
presumably since they would meet in person. Contentious debates in
Newton scholarship over issues like whether he thought gravity was a
property of matter and whether he accepted action at a distance (e.g.,
Brown 2016, Henry 2020) means it is difficult to determine when the
views in the correspondence align with Newton&rsquo;s views. Current
opinion has shifted toward attributing most of the philosophical
arguments in the correspondence to Clarke, a move sparked by a
reappraisal in recent years of Clarke&rsquo;s philosophical
ability.</p>

<p>
In reading the letters to Leibniz, it is helpful to remember that the
views defended might not belong only to Clarke or only to Newton, so
attribution to a single figure might be misguided. What we have might
be the intersection of their views, or they might be views that Newton
held privately but did not yet want to avow publicly, or they might be
a mixture of some of Clarke&rsquo;s views and some of Newton&rsquo;s
views. In some cases, we can see connections to other publications by
Newton and Clarke. For instance, space as a <em>sensorium</em> (organ
of sensation) of God, which Leibniz ridiculed in his first letter to
Caroline, appeared first in Newton&rsquo;s <em>Principia</em> and
<em>Opticks</em> and not in Clarke&rsquo;s other works. (Clarke tries
to argue that Newton does not believe that space is the
<em>sensorium</em> of God, but Koyr&eacute; and Cohen [1961,
563&ndash;566] argue that Newton did believe it and tried to disguise
or soften the view in publication.) Clarke defends atomism in the
letters to Leibniz, but in his other works he claims that all matter
is infinitely divisible, which suggests he was accomodating
Newton&rsquo;s view. On the other hand, there are many arguments based
on the principle of sufficient reason, which is fundamental to
Clarke&rsquo;s philosophy and which he employed in his Boyle lectures
twelve years earlier, but does not play an explicit role in
Newton&rsquo;s publications. Other cases are more difficult to connect
to Newton&rsquo;s and Clarke&rsquo;s other works, such as the famous
passage in which space is called &ldquo;an immediate and necessary
consequence of the existence of God,&rdquo; since
&ldquo;consequence&rdquo; is not a term otherwise used by either
Clarke or Newton on this issue.</p>

<h2 id="MajoThemClar">2. Major Themes in Clarke</h2>

<p>
Three major themes run through all of Clarke&rsquo;s philosophical
works: Newtonianism, anti-naturalism, and rationalism.</p>

<h3 id="NewtAntiNatu">2.1 Newtonianism and Anti-Naturalism</h3>

<p>
There is a widespread agreement that Newton influenced Clarke. Newton
was thirty years Clarke&rsquo;s senior, and their relationship
(post-1704) might best be thought of as a mentorship. Newton and
Clarke likely held similar views about God&rsquo;s role in the world,
but Newton was hesitant to state these positions publicly, and he may
have used the Boyle lectures to promote these views (Force 1984;
522&ndash;526). Many have thought he supported Clarke&rsquo;s
interpretations and theological defenses (Jacob 1976; 242). In private
correspondence, such as the letters to Bentley of December 10, 1692,
and January 17, 1693, he entertains views similar to those that Clarke
would later proclaim. Whiston (1728) reports that when Newton was
asked why he did not publicly announce them, Newton &ldquo;saw those
Consequences; but thought it better to let his Readers draw them first
of themselves.&rdquo; It is also possible that Clarke influenced
Newton. In the &ldquo;General Scholium&rdquo; of the 1713 edition of
the <em>Principia</em>, Newton endorsed views and arguments about the
nature of God that had been previously published by Clarke (Stewart
1996; Snobelen 2001, 14&ndash;18).</p>

<p>
On scientific, philosophical, and theological grounds, Clarke believed
Newtonian natural philosophy to be superior to all alternatives, and
Newton&rsquo;s natural philosophy provide a basis for Clarke&rsquo;s
religious and social views (Stewart 1981). Clarke saw in
Newtonian&rsquo;s natural philosophy a world that could only exist by
a free act of God. Matter is dispersed sparingly throughout empty
space, gravity is universal to matter but not inherent in it, and the
universe is ordered according to rules that are neither absolutely
necessary nor chaotic. Clarke concluded that the laws of nature do not
describe the powers of matter, which is just dead mass constantly
pushed around, but modalities of operation of the divine power. The
occasionalists also denied that matter had the power to move itself
and that the only thing with such power is God, but Clarke appeals to
both divine and human immaterial souls to explain motion. Thus, nature
is not a self-sufficient system; without direct and constant divine
intervention, planets would fly away from their orbits and atoms would
break into their components. The naturalist attempt to describe the
world solely by the arrangement and matter in motion is doomed to fail
on scientific and metaphysical grounds and must give way to a world
with an active God. This is why &ldquo;the foundations of natural
religion had never been so deeply and firmly laid, as in the
mathematical and experimental philosophy of that great man&rdquo;
(W4.582). Clarke did not provide the only major interpretation and
explication of Newton&rsquo;s natural philosophy, but it was an
influential one (Yenter 2023).</p>

<h3 id="Rati">2.2 Rationalism</h3>

<p>
Clarke adopted some form of rationalism in metaphysics, ethics, and
theology.</p>

<p>
The <em>Demonstration</em> makes great use of the principle of
sufficient reason (PSR), which motivates the cosmological argument,
and he explicitly and repeatedly avows it in the correspondence with
Leibniz (C 3.2, W 4.606). The PSR was used both in Clarke&rsquo;s
positive metaphysical arguments and was assumed in his arguments
against other philosophers, especially Spinoza, whom he chastises for
failing to explain the diversity of things that exist (Yenter 2014).
The PSR is not mentioned in the correspondence with Collins, but he
there adopts principles that can be derived from it. Clarke&rsquo;s
understanding of the principle of sufficient reason differs notably
from Leibniz&rsquo;s understanding, with whom it is more frequently
associated. This was a major point of contention in their
correspondence. Clarke asserts that the sufficient reason why
something exists as it does may be due to the &ldquo;mere Will&rdquo;
of God and nothing more (C 3.2, W 4.606&ndash;607; C 5.124&ndash;130,
W 4.700). This involves two claims. First, in cases of complete
indifference (such as God choosing where to place the world in the
infinite expanse of absolute space), God is capable of acting even if
there is no reason to prefer one option over another. Second, a free
will is able to refrain from acting on what reason presents to it as
best to do. As a consequence of these, Clarke denies the identity of
indiscernibles. This is significant for Clarke&rsquo;s defense of
Newton, because if space is real and absolute, then the identity of
indiscernibles must be false because regions of space are
indiscernible with respect to their intrinsic and (prior to the
creation of the world) their extrinsic properties. Clarke may also
have felt the need to accommodate indiscernible atoms, which Newton
seemed to allow.</p>

<p>
Because Clarke denies the identity of indiscernibles and affirms
libertarianism (but see Section 3.2 below), Leibniz claims that Clarke
grants the principle of sufficient reason &ldquo;only in Words, and in
reality denies it. Which shews that he does not fully perceive the
Strength of it&rdquo; (L 3.2, W 4.601). In response, Clarke argues
that if Leibniz is right then a free agent would be merely passive
because determined to do what reason presents, but a &ldquo;passive
agent&rdquo; is a contradiction since the concept of agency includes
the concept of activity. Leibniz was never satisfied with
Clarke&rsquo;s position and by the fifth letter he was more explicit
than previously that the principle of sufficient reason and the
principle of the identity of indiscernibles are not independent but
the latter is derived from the former (L 5.21), and, in the fifth
letter&rsquo;s cover letter to Caroline, Leibniz asserts, &ldquo;If
[Clarke] does not entirely accept the received great principle that
nothing happens without there being a sufficient reason why it happens
thus rather than otherwise, I could not help doubting his sincerity,
and if he grants it then farewell to the philosophy of Monsieur
Newton&rdquo; (quoted in Khamara 2006, 4).</p>

<p>
Ethical truths are discoverable through reason and correspond to
necessary and eternal relations among things in the world. He also
calls ethical truths &ldquo;truths of reason.&rdquo; His theology is
sometimes described as rationalist because through reason one can
discover the many truths contained in natural religion and that the
correct Christian doctrines are not mysterious, nor
self-contradictory, and nearly all can be comprehended by human
beings. However, against the Deists, who generally expected all
necessary moral and religious truths to be discoverable by reason,
Clarke asserted that revealed religion (also called special
revelation) provided information necessary for salvation (W
2.666&ndash;667). While special revelation involved &ldquo;supplying
the deficiencies&rdquo; of &ldquo;right reason,&rdquo; it could not
contradict reason (W 2.669).</p>

<h2 id="Meta">3. Metaphysics</h2>

<h3 id="AbsoInfiSpacTime">3.1 Absolute and Infinite Space and Time</h3>

<p>
According to Clarke, the ideas of space and time are the two
&ldquo;first and most obvious simple Ideas, that every man has in his
mind&rdquo; (D 114, W 2.752). Drawing on an argument from Newton
(1726, 410), he argued that while matter can be thought of as
non-existing, space exists necessarily because &ldquo;to suppose any
part of space removed, is to suppose it removed from and out of
itself: and to suppose the whole to be taken away, is supposing it to
be taken away from itself, that is, to be taken away while it still
remains: which is a contradiction in terms&rdquo; (D 13, W 2.528).
Space is not an aggregate of its parts but an essential whole
preceding all it parts.</p>

<p>
Absolute space was allegedly required for Newtonian physics. Space is
not the mere absence of matter but is that in which things are. All
finite beings occupy an absolute position in space and time that we
may or may not be able to establish because we have no direct access
to absolute space and time. Although space is not sensible, Clarke
rejected its identification with nothingness, since space has
properties: quantity and dimension, and perhaps homogeneity,
immutability, continuity, and the ability to contain matter. Edmund
Law (1758, 10) objects that this makes no more sense than saying that
darkness has qualities because it has the property of receiving
light.</p>

<p>
Because our ideas are always finite, infinite space must exist outside
of us (Watts 1733, 4). Clarke believed that space is necessarily
infinite because &ldquo;to set bounds to space, is to suppose it
bounded by something which itself takes up space&rdquo; or else that
&ldquo;it is bounded by nothing, and then the idea of that nothing
will still be space,&rdquo; and both suppositions are contradictory (D
115, W 2.753). Clarke apparently thought that what has a boundary must
be bounded by something else. If so, the argument was not well taken
because a sphere, for example, has a boundary which stems from its own
nature, not by the presence of something external bounding it (Vailati
2006, 111). One possible solution is to appeal to space&rsquo;s
peculiar nature as a property of an infinite God, which would require
that it be boundless in virtue of God&rsquo;s possible activity being
boundless (W 1.47), but this might reverse the proper order of
explanation or beg the question. (For more on the relationship of God
to space, see Section 4.2 below.) He also argues that because
existence or being is a perfection, existing in more places is a
greater perfection, so God (as the most perfect being) must exist in
all places (W 1.46&ndash;47). Clarke could also appeal to the PSR (any
finite limit would be arbitrary, and thus in violation of the PSR);
however, Leibniz employs a similar argument against empty space, so
such a move could be counterproductive for Clarke (LCC 117b).</p>

<h3 id="FreeWill">3.2 Free Will</h3>

<p>
Clarke attached great importance to the issue of free will, and he may
have introduced the modern philosophical meaning of the term
&ldquo;agency&rdquo; (Schneewind 1997, 313). His philosophical
writings have traditionally been read as defending a libertarian power
of self-determination, in contrast with the compatibilist theories of
his opponents, who included Leibniz, Anthony Collins, and Jonathan
Edwards. The traditional reading, with responses, is described in what
follows, with a discussion of alternative readings at the end of this
subsection.</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s primary defense of libertarian freedom begins with
distinguishing the will and the judgment. In order to will, one must
have a judgment about what to do and the power to choose in accordance
with that judgment. This power to choose is provided by the will. The
will is not to be identified with the last judgment of the
understanding nor is it a volition caused by a judgment. Those (like
Hobbes) who thought so were guilty of basic philosophical errors. If
they maintained that the content of the evaluative proposition is
either identical with the volition or causes it, then they were
confusing the &ldquo;moral motive&rdquo; with the &ldquo;physical
efficient,&rdquo; the physical efficient being the element of the
cause that provides the active power (D 73, W 2.565). Because the
moral motive is simply an abstract object (a proposition) and abstract
objects are causally inert, the moral motive cannot cause anything. On
the other hand, if one maintained that, not the evaluative
proposition, but one&rsquo;s perceiving, judging or otherwise
believing it is the cause (or a partial cause) of volition, then one
falls foul of a basic causal principle: what is passive cannot cause
anything active. Against Descartes, Clarke insisted that judging,
i.e., assenting to what appears true and dissenting from what appears
false, is not an action but a passion. So there is no causal link
between evaluation and volition, or, as Clarke put it, between
&ldquo;approbation and action&rdquo; (D 126, W 4.714). In general,
there is no causal link between previous non-volitional mental states,
all of which are passive, and any volition (Vailati 1997,
82&ndash;84).</p>

<p>
Jonathan Edwards (1754, 222&ndash;223) argued that Clarke was
committed to an infinite regress of volitions. Because each volition
is active, it must be caused by something active; but every other
purported motivation is passive, so each volition is caused by a
previous volition, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. However, Clarke
did not believe that each volition was caused by a previous volition,
but rather each volition is caused by the will itself. This raises a
different problem, noticed by Leibniz: because the conditions for the
will choosing in accordance with the judgment are exactly the same as
when it refrains from choosing, there is no explanation for why it
does one rather than the other, in violation of the principle of
sufficient reason (L 4.1, W 4.612; L 5.14, W4.634). Clarke never
provided a response to this charge that satisfied Leibniz; his
strongest response was his claim that denying this account of the will
would lead to accepting passive agency, which is a contradiction.</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s analysis of agency supports divine freedom (Rowe 2004,
Sangiacomo 2018), but divine freedom raises new problems for Clarke.
For one, human and divine freedom are perhaps in tension with
God&rsquo;s knowledge of future events. Against the claim that divine
foreknowledge is incompatible with free will, Clarke argued that
because knowledge does not affect the thing known, our free choices
are unaffected by divine omniscience (D 75&ndash;78, W
2.566&ndash;568). A second problem is that God always does what is
best, so God cannot refrain from acting on his judgment of what is
best, and thus acts necessarily, which Clarke claims is a
contradiction (D 83&ndash;86, W 571&ndash;573). Clarke could rely,
again, on the passivity of judgment (or the difference between
physical causes and moral reasons) to block the move that God&rsquo;s
judgment determines God&rsquo;s choice. Thus, even though we have
complete certainty that God always does what is best, it does not
follow that God doing the best is necessitated by God&rsquo;s judgment
of what is right to do. This response is nested in Clarke&rsquo;s
official response, which is to distinguish God&rsquo;s metaphysical
attributes from his moral attributes. Because God&rsquo;s will is not
determined by God&rsquo;s knowing that an action is the best, our
certainty that God will do what is best is due to our confidence in
&ldquo;the unalterable <em>Rectitude of his Will</em>&rdquo; and not a
necessity of his nature (D 86&ndash;87, W 573). In other words, it is
a moral necessity and not a metaphysical
 necessity.[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]
 A third and related problem is that when God created the world, he
did what was best to do, but had a choice among an infinite number of
equally best ways of creating the world because he could place the
world anywhere in space and could create it at any time. Thus, it does
not follow from God&rsquo;s perfect judgment combined with his
infinite power to create that God should create the world in a
particular way. Leibniz claims this is incompatible with the PSR and
that he has &ldquo;reduced Clarke to absurdity&rdquo; (LCC 154), but
Clarke denies there is any problem (C 4.18&ndash;20, W 4.626).</p>

<p>
Despite the traditional reading, which dates to Clarke&rsquo;s own
lifetime, there are solid reasons for rejecting the view that Clarke
was a libertarian. The first reason comes from his various definitions
of liberty and freedom. Clarke provides at least four definitions, two
of which occur in the sermon &ldquo;Of the Liberty of Moral
Agents.&rdquo; Here he claims that the &ldquo;True liberty of a
Rational and Moral Agent&rdquo; is &ldquo;being able to follow
<em>right Reason only</em>, without Hindrance or Restraint&rdquo; (W
1.219). Also in that sermon, Clarke calls acting as one pleases, which
humans and non-human animals have, &ldquo;mere <em>physical</em> or
<em>natural</em> liberty&rdquo; (W 1.218). These two definition of
liberty are compatibilist. Elsewhere, he argues that human freedom
requires a self-determining will that could freely assent or refrain
from assenting to the mind&rsquo;s judgments; this is a freedom of
choosing and not a freedom of acting, such that a prisoner in chains
&ldquo;who chooses or endeavors to move out of his place is therein as
much a free agent as he that actually moves out of his place&rdquo; (D
75, W 2.566). Clarke also entertains a fourth notion: freedom is
&ldquo;a principle of acting, or power of beginning motion, which is
the idea of liberty&rdquo; (D 54, W 2.553; see also D 125, W 2.714).
The ability to begin motion marks freedom as a power only held by
non-material agents, because matter has no power of self-motion. This
fourth definition is probably the most important of the three to
Clarke&rsquo;s project (Harris 2005, 46&ndash;61; Greenberg 2013,
249&ndash;251). Clarke does not explicitly reconcile these
compatibilist (first, second) and incompatibilist (third, arguably
fourth) definitions. One way to do so is to make the libertarian power
of self-determination a necessary condition for the compatibilist
understanding of freedom as following reason without restraint.</p>

<p>
Two recent dissenters to the traditional reading have drawn on
Clarke&rsquo;s discussion of divine freedom. Lukas Wolf (2022) argues
that Clarke rejects divine voluntarism, and it is certainly true that
Clarke denies the view in ethics that moral obligations depend on the
will of God (W 2.576). Clarke and Leibniz are both intellectualists,
according to Wolf, with the important differences between them being
whether a sufficient <em>reason</em> is also a sufficient
<em>cause</em> and whether the principle of the best (without
exception God does what is the wisest and the maximally good) is
derived from the PSR (Wolf 2022, 8&ndash;10). Clarke denies both;
Leibniz affirms both. While Wolf does not claim Clarke is a
compatibilist, his approach leaves this possibility available. Julia
Jorati (2021) argues that Clarke and Leibniz agree on most matters
regarding freedom, and it is only equipose cases where they disagree
about whether a perfectly good, perfectly free being would be able to
act. Jorati&rsquo;s argument relies heavily on the claim that Clarke
is committed to the moral necessity of God&rsquo;s doing what is best;
because this is a kind of necessity, she claims, Clarke, like Leibniz,
is an agent-causal compatibilist. This requires reading Clarke&rsquo;s
notion of moral necessity as having the same modal status as logical,
metaphysical, and physical necessity (although allowing for freedom
where those three do not) and rejecting the views that moral necessity
is a psychological category of certainty or that it is equivalent to
what is typically called moral certainty (Jorati 2021, 177&ndash;178,
189&ndash;190, 199). Such a reading has to contend with passages such
as the following, where Clarke seems to deny that moral necessity is
necessity in any literal sense: &ldquo;And is it not evident, that the
Necessity by which God is Omnipresent or Omniscient, and the Necessity
by which he keeps his Promise, are things that have no Similitude but
in Name ; the one being natural and literal, the other merely
figurative and moral?&rdquo; (D 126, W 2.714). Jorati&rsquo;s response
has two bases: that we need to explain the certainty of a perfect
being&rsquo;s actions, and that Clarke only rules out being
<em>externally</em> determined (Jorati 2021, 185).</p>

<p>
Whether Clarke was a libertarian or a voluntarist, there is near
universal agreement that he accepted agent causation. Showing the
consistency of agent causation with his other views is central to a
satisfying interpretation of Clarke&rsquo;s metaphysics, ethics, and
theology (e.g., Rowe 2004, 23&ndash;35; Sangiacomo 2018).</p>

<h3 id="MattLawsNatu">3.3 Matter and the Laws of Nature</h3>

<p>
Clarke steadfastly maintained that matter does not have an essential,
accidental, or super-added power of self-motion. &ldquo;All things
done in the world, are done either immediately by God himself, or by
created intelligent beings: matter being evidently not at all capable
of any laws or powers whatsoever&rdquo; (D 149, W 2.698).
Consequently, the so called &ldquo;effects of the natural powers of
matter, and laws of motion; of gravitation, attraction, or the
like&rdquo; properly speaking are but the &ldquo;effects of
God&rsquo;s acting upon matter continually and every moment, either
immediately by himself, or mediately by some created intelligent
beings&rdquo; (Ibid.). Thus, the course of nature is &ldquo;nothing
else but the will of God producing certain effects in a continued,
regular, constant and uniform manner which&hellip;being in every
moment perfectly arbitrary, is as easy to be altered at any time, as
to be preserved&rdquo; (Ibid). The laws of nature are thus not
absolutely necessary but only morally necessary, continuing as they do
only because of the unchanging will of God.</p>

<p>
With regard to the much contested interpretation of Newton on gravity,
he declares that Newton &ldquo;does not mean to say that attraction is
the cause of bodies coming together; but by attraction he means to
express the effect&rdquo; (Kassler 2014; 145&ndash;146). Leibniz, in
his correspondence with Clarke, argues that Newton is committed to
gravity as force, suggesting two importantly different readings of
Newton (Janiak 2007). While Newton would not speculate publicly on
metaphysical matters, Clarke argued that this effect could not be the
work of a body. Rather, God and designated (subordinate, intelligent,
immaterial) agents act throughout the world by being present where
they act, which is the explanation for gravity and all other movements
of matter (Brown 2016,
 42ff).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The claim that matter has not even an accidental power of self-motion
was central to Clarke&rsquo;s attempt to exhibit the manifest activity
of God and to refute Spinozism (Schliesser 2012, 443&ndash;449). The
claim was radical for the time and elicited many responses. Collins,
in a letter to John Trenchard, was angered and unimpressed by
Clarke&rsquo;s arguments, which was a common reaction for the growing
number of freethinkers (Jacob 1977; 20). Andrew Baxter (1733, with an
important appendix added in 1750) would later extend Clarke&rsquo;s
arguments against self-motion, showing that they apply to ether as
well as matter, at a time when ether theories had gained popularity as
interpretations of Newton and as hypotheses for explaining
gravity.</p>

<p>
Despite his insistence on God&rsquo;s continual activity in the world,
Clarke was not an occasionalist. Unlike the occasionalists, Clarke
does not claim that God is the real cause of interactions between
finite minds and matter, only between bodies. Furthermore, matter has
a single &ldquo;<em>Negative Power</em>&rdquo; of staying at rest or
continuing in motion (W 2.697; Winkler 1989). Although this position
became common in England and Scotland in the eighteenth century, there
is no widely accepted term for this view, which has been called
&ldquo;body-body occasionalism&rdquo; (Ablondi 2013), &ldquo;partial
occasionalism&rdquo; (Sangiacomo 2018), and
&ldquo;semi-occasionalism&rdquo; (Yenter 2022).</p>

<h3 id="Soul">3.4 Consciousness, the Soul, and Personal Identity</h3>

<p>
Henry Dodwell publicly defended the view that the soul is naturally
mortal but is made immortal by God only at a baptism performed by
someone properly ordained. Clarke wrote an open letter defending the
soul&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural&rdquo; immortality. Furthermore, all souls
survive bodily death, the soul remains in a state of (literal or
metaphorical) sleep until the final judgment, the souls of those not
admitted to heaven are destroyed at the final judgment, and there is
no hell of eternal
 suffering.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Employing what Kant (1781, A351) dubbed the &ldquo;Achilles
argument,&rdquo; Clarke claims that the essential unity of
consciousness is incompatible with the divisibility and composability
of
 matter.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 The soul cannot be material, because what is material is divisible,
and what is divisible cannot be the source of the unity of
consciousness. (He assumes throughout that if the soul is immaterial
then it is immortal.) If consciousness were a property of matter, then
the consciousness must be distributed among the various component
parts, rendering each part conscious. Clarke&rsquo;s argument rests on
two principles. The Homogeneity Principle says that &ldquo;a power can
really inhere in a composite only if it is of the same kind as the
powers of the parts&rdquo; (Vailati 1993, 395). Strictly, the
Homogeneity Principle only applies to the first category of qualities
(Rozemond 2009, 180). The Composition Principle says that &ldquo;the
properties of the parts will sum to the same properties of the whole
(and that the properties of the whole can be divided into the
parts)&rdquo; (Uzgalis 2011, 23). William Uzgalis finds versions of
the Homogeneity Principle in Cudworth and Bayle, and in all three
cases it is used to argue that thought or consciousness cannot arise
from motion or figure because they are not of the same kind. A less
often discussed variation on Clarke&rsquo;s core argument (but see
Rozemond 2003, 182ff) is that &ldquo;figure, divisibility, mobility
and other such like qualities of matter&rdquo; cannot produce
conscious thought (a real power) because they are &ldquo;not real,
proper, distinct, and positive powers, but only negative qualities,
deficiencies, and imperfections,&rdquo; which appeals to the principle
that there can be no perfection or power in the effect that is not in
the cause (D 41, W 2.545).</p>

<p>
Anthony Collins publicly responded to Clarke to defend the position
that consciousness can be an emergent property of matter, opening the
door for a materialist theory of mind. Central to Collins&rsquo;s
response is that there are properties held by material compositions,
such as the smell of a rose, that are not held by any part, perhaps
due to the organization of those compositions (Uzgalis 2021,
269&ndash;270). In reply, loosely following Locke&rsquo;s
distinctions, Clarke argues that there are three kinds of properties:
those that inhere in the substance (real properties), those that are
commonly but improperly believed to reside in the substance (secondary
qualities, such as the smell of a rose), and &ldquo;<em>merely
abstract names</em> to express the <em>effects</em>&rdquo; of material
substances or systems, which includes magnetism and gravity (CC
56&ndash;58). Consciousness falls in the first category, but, unlike
the other members of that category such as magnitude and figure, it
does not divide or sum. Lukas Wolf (2019) has shown important
similarities between Clarke&rsquo;s arguments against gravity as
possibly super-added to matter and against consciousness, freedom, and
self-motion as possibly emergent properties.</p>

<p>
The enduring soul serves as Clarke&rsquo;s explanation for personal
identity. Collins, following Locke, argued for a memory theory of
personal identity. Clarke responded that God could put one
person&rsquo;s memories into multiple people; they would be distinct
people but each would be identical to the original person, so identity
is not transitive. Although Clarke&rsquo;s argument became popular in
the eighteenth century (Barresi and Martin 2004, 33&ndash;49), it
seems to have been forgotten then reintroduced in the 1950s (Uzgalis
33, citing Flew 1951, Prior 1957, and Williams 1957). Collins pointed
out that Clarke&rsquo;s theory faces an unpleasant dilemma, in that
either animals (who do exhibit self-motion) do not think or have
experiences (implausible) or God has to deal with an animal&rsquo;s
soul (in animal heaven or annihilation) (Garrett 2013, 181). Leibniz
also raised this challenge in a 1715 letter to Caroline (LCC 91).</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s claim that the unity of consciousness is incompatible
with divisible matter is complicated by his apparent belief that souls
are extended, a view defended in the previous generation by Henry
More. At least, Clarke refused to rule out the possibility that souls
are extended because &ldquo;as the parts of space or expansion itself
can demonstrably be proved to be <em>absolutely indiscerptible</em>
[indivisible], so it ought not to be reckoned an insuperable
difficulty to imagine that all <em>immaterial thinking substances</em>
(upon supposition that expansion is not excluded out of their idea)
may be so likewise&rdquo; (CC 62, W 3.763). The issue, as Clarke tries
to frame it, is not that consciousness is incompatible with extension
but that it is incompatible with anything divisible into parts.
Because, following Newton, Clarke denies that space is actually
divisible into parts, it cannot be ruled out that the soul is
extended. His acceptance of the principle that there is no action at a
distance and of the claim that immaterial beings (both finite and God)
act in space perhaps push him to accept that the soul is extended. If
so, he does not explain whether the soul occupies the same space as
the whole body, the brain, or some part of the brain or how souls move
from place to place if not affected by bodies. Richard Price and
Joseph Priestley both read Clarke as accepting extended souls, as had
Leibniz (LCC 91). Priestley objects that souls must therefore have
shape (which he takes to be implausible) and must interpenetrate
God&rsquo;s spiritual substance (which he takes to be impossible, as
in the impossible case of colocated physical substances) (Price and
Priestley 1777, 58&ndash;62).</p>

<h2 id="PhilTheo">4. Philosophical Theology</h2>

<p>
This section reviews Clarke&rsquo;s key arguments in philosophy of
religion and philosophical theology. The topic of divine freedom was
covered in the earlier section on free will, as well as in the entry
on
 <a href="../divine-freedom/">divine freedom</a>.
 Clarke also wrote on topics such as divine attributes, baptism, the
historicity of disputed New Testament writings, and the veracity of
various Christian doctrines, which are not discussed here.</p>

<h3 id="ArguPrio">4.1 Argument <em>A Priori</em></h3>

<p>
Clarke thought highly of the argument from design, which he thought
were widely accessible and easily grasped. However, due to the rise of
atheistic systems of philosophy, he thought it was necessary to give
an argument that would satisfy his fellow metaphysicians. Clarke
writes that his argument for the being and attributes of God was done
&ldquo;<em>partly by metaphysical Reasoning, and partly from the
Discoveries (principally those that have been lately made) in Natural
Philosophy</em>&rdquo; (W 2.581). His argument, which was known in
Clarke&rsquo;s time as &ldquo;the argument <em>a priori</em>,&rdquo;
occupies most of <em>A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of
God</em>, Clarke&rsquo;s first set of Boyle
 Lectures.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 The argument is typically classified today as cosmological, but it
should not be confused with the <em>kalam</em> cosmological argument
(which takes as a premise that the world has a finite history).
Clarke&rsquo;s version belongs to the tradition of modal cosmological
arguments that employ the principle of sufficient reason to argue from
a contingent series of causes to a necessary being. The main lines of
Clarke&rsquo;s &ldquo;argument <em>a priori</em>&rdquo; are as
 follows.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Something now exists, so something always was, otherwise nothing would
exist now because it is impossible for something to be produced by
nothing (D 8, W
 2.524).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 What has existed from eternity can only be an independent being (one
having in itself the reason of its existence) or an infinite series of
dependent beings (wherein each being depends on other beings in the
series). However, such an infinite series cannot be what has existed
from eternity because by hypothesis it can have no external cause, and
no internal cause (no dependent being in the series) can cause the
whole series. Hence, an independent being exists. A frequent objection
to this argument is that the demand for an explanation is satisfied
when it is conceded that each being in the series has a cause (Rowe
1971, 56&ndash;57). The series is not a new entity to be explained, so
there is no reason to appeal to an eternal, independent being.
Furthermore, if the series is not dependent, then it is not
contingent, and if it is not contingent, then it is necessary. Clarke
finds this option unacceptable, as have many since (including Rowe
1973, 57&ndash;59, and van Inwagen 2014, 159&ndash;182), and
Clarke&rsquo;s appeal to God&rsquo;s will to maintain the contingency
of the created world has been challenged, especially by Leibniz (see
3.2, above).</p>

<p>
This independent being is &ldquo;self-existent, that is, necessarily
existing&rdquo; (D 12, W 2.527), a conclusion he also reaches by
arguing that space and time cannot be conceived not to exist and they
are obviously not self-existent, so the substance on which they
depend, God, must exist necessarily as well (D 13, W 2.527&ndash;528).
For Clarke a &ldquo;necessary being&rdquo; is a being whose
non-existence is impossible (either because it is an independent being
or because it is necessarily dependent on an independent being), and a
&ldquo;self-existent being&rdquo; is a being whose non-existence is
impossible because the necessity of its existence is to be found in
its own nature. Once these two are distinguished, however, Clarke is
open to the criticism that he cannot rule out the existence of two
self-existent beings (as he attempts in the seventh proposition)
because there may be two beings who are self-existent even though only
one self-existent being is required to explain the existence of the
world (Law 1758, 21). Anthony Atkey (1725, 3&ndash;14) provided a
variation on this objection in correspondence. He alleges that Clarke
illegitimately moves from the existence of at least one
&ldquo;necessary being&rdquo; to the existence of no more than one
&ldquo;self-existent being.&rdquo; Clarke concludes that <em>there
exists</em> only one self-existent being, but he has at best shown
that we cannot <em>have the idea</em> of two self-existent beings.
Atkey&rsquo;s objection is about the relationship of the conceivable
to the possible. Clarke&rsquo;s response (Atkey 1725, 17&ndash;19) is
that we have clear ideas in this case, so our ideas can guide us in
the nature of things (conceivability entails possibility in the case
of clear ideas), but he does not give any reason why we should think
our ideas are clear in this case. This problem is exacerbated by his
denial that we have adequate ideas of the essences of substances,
including God. If we do not have adequate ideas of any substances
(including the divine being) then how could we have a clear idea of
God? Roger North had previously raised a similar worry about Clarke
needing to show that &ldquo;natural things accord with our
ideas,&rdquo; but Clarke&rsquo;s response has not survived (NC
133).</p>

<p>
If successful, Clarke&rsquo;s argument <em>a priori</em> establishes
all the metaphysical attributes of God (independence, eternality,
immutability, infinitude, omnipresence) by examining the nature of
necessity and positing the contingency of the world. To reach the
personal and moral attributes of God, it is necessary to draw upon
further features of the world and argue <em>a posteriori</em> (D 38, W
2.543). Clarke attempted a variety of arguments to establish that God
is an agent (that is, that God is not only intelligent but has a will
that is free in a libertarian sense). First, one real feature of the
world is that there are intelligent beings in it. Intelligence, being
a perfection, must exist to at least as great a degree in the cause as
in the effect (an instance of Clarke&rsquo;s applying a causal version
of the PSR). So God must be intelligent (D38&ndash;39, W 4.543).
Second, this intelligence can be established from the order and beauty
of the world, so a teleological argument can reach this conclusion as
well. Third, Clarke claimed that &ldquo;intelligence without liberty
&hellip; is really (in respect of any power, excellence, or
perfection) no intelligence at all,&rdquo; so therefore God must be an
agent. Fourth, anyone positing a God without freedom (Clarke
specifically mentions Spinoza) is positing a contradiction and has
failed to explain the source of activity in the world (D 46&ndash;47,
W 4.548&ndash;549). Finally, the necessitarian (like Spinoza) is
forced to deny a number of (to Clarke) obvious points, including that
things could be different than they are, that there are final causes
in the universe, and that there are a variety of finite things in the
universe (Yenter 2014). With God&rsquo;s intelligence and agency in
place, he sketches how God&rsquo;s wisdom, goodness, justice, and
other moral perfections can be established.</p>

<h3 id="GodSpacTime">4.2 God, Space, and Time</h3>

<p>
Clarke accepted the traditional Christian beliefs that God is eternal
and omnipresent, and he attempted to explain what those claims mean.
Four central tenets of Clarke&rsquo;s position are unpacked below.</p>

<p>
<em><em>God is able to act at all times and in all places because he
is substantially present in all times and in all places</em>.</em> To
deny this would entail accepting action at a distance, which Clarke,
like most of his contemporaries (including Leibniz: see LCC 72), found
mysterious or impossible (Brown 2016).</p>

<p>
<em>God&rsquo;s substantial presence entails that the Scholastic view
of divine eternity and immensity is false</em>. Clarke rejected the
view of God as substantially removed from space and time. Divine
eternity involves both necessary existence and infinite duration
which, however, could not be identified with the traditional notion of
the eternal present (<em>nunc stans</em>) according to which God
exists in an unchanging permanent present without any successive
duration. He considered such a view unintelligible at best and
contradictory at worst (CC 107, W 3.794). The attribution of
successive duration to God might suggest that God, like us, is in time
but, unlike us, does not change. However, this was not Clarke&rsquo;s
view. In his exchanges with Butler he clarifies that God is not
technically in space and time, because God is prior (in the order of
nature) to time whereas things in time are metaphysically subsequent
to the existence of time. Moreover, he attributed distinct and
successive thoughts to God; otherwise God could not &ldquo;vary his
will, nor diversify his works, nor act successively, nor govern the
world, nor indeed have any power to will or do anything at all&rdquo;
(W 3.897). Hence, God is immutable with respect to his will only in
the sense that he does not change his mind.</p>

<p>
<em>God is not identical to space or time; although necessary, they
depend for their existence upon God</em>. Clarke&rsquo;s earliest
reported philosophical idea, years before he read Newton, is that God
cannot destroy space (Whiston 1730, 22&ndash;23). A common worry about
absolute space in the eighteenth century was that if space is
infinite, necessary, and indestructible then either God is not the
only infinite, necessary, and independent being or God is identical to
space, both of which were theologically unorthodox. Clarke&rsquo;s
position in the <em>Demonstration</em>, the letters to Butler, and the
letter to an anonymous author (almost certainly Daniel Waterland) is
that space and time are divine attributes or properties, a view he may
have found in Henry More (Thomas 2015, 18). Because they depend on the
only self-subsisting being, they are not independent beings (D
122&ndash;123, W 4.758). He told Leibniz that immensity and eternality
are &ldquo;an immediate and necessary consequence&rdquo; of
God&rsquo;s existence, without supplying any further argument or
explaining the relationship between &ldquo;consequence,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mode,&rdquo; &ldquo;attribute,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;property.&rdquo; Many have understood Clarke to mean that God
is literally dimensional. Clarke&rsquo;s early critic Anthony Collins
(1713, 47&ndash;48) read him this way. Emily Thomas (2018,
172&ndash;176) has shown that Clarke&rsquo;s views undergo a change
after 1719; from this point on Clarke is careful to say that immensity
and eternality are &ldquo;modes of existence&rdquo; rather than
attributes. Modes of existence can be ascribed to God <em>and</em> to
God&rsquo;s attributes, whereas an attribute cannot be ascribed to any
other attribute. So God is eternal <em>and</em> God&rsquo;s
intelligence is eternal; therefore eternality is a mode of existence.
God is intelligent, but God&rsquo;s will is not intelligent;
therefore, intelligence is an attribute. Gregory Brown (2023,
xcii&ndash;xciv) attributes Clarke&rsquo;s 1719 change to Newton desiring to
clarify his views after Clarke&rsquo;s possibly inconsistent
discussion in the letters to Leibniz.</p>

<p>
<em>God&rsquo;s immensity and eternality are consistent with
God&rsquo;s unity</em>. As Leibniz and Waterland noted, the
identification of divine immensity with space endangers the simplicity
of the divine being because space has parts, albeit not separable
ones. The objection, though formidable, was not new; Bayle in the
<em>Dictionnaire</em> (entry &ldquo;Leucippus,&rdquo; remark G) had
chided the Newtonians for identifying space with divine immensity in
order to solve the ontological problem created by the positing of an
infinite space because it leads to the destruction of divine
simplicity and to various absurdities. As a further point, Waterland
suggests that since Clarke accepts that nothing with parts can be the
subject of consciousness, God&rsquo;s immensity also undermines divine
intelligence and consciousness. Clarke offered two responses. Firstly,
not everything extended has parts. Space is extended, but (as Newton
had claimed) its &ldquo;parts&rdquo; cannot be moved, so they are not
truly parts. Secondly, Clarke claimed parity between spatial and
temporal extendedness: because the former is compatible with the
simplicity of what &ldquo;stretches&rdquo; temporally, the latter is
compatible with the simplicity of what stretches spatially. But the
parity between space and time, were it to be granted, rather than
showing that spatial extendedness is not detrimental to a
thing&rsquo;s simplicity because temporal extendedness is not, could
be taken to show that the latter is detrimental to a thing&rsquo;s
simplicity because the former is.</p>

<h3 id="TrinView">4.3 Trinitarian Views</h3>

<p>
In his lifetime, Clarke was infamous for his view of the trinity, and
he sparked a vociferous debate (Ferguson 1974, 59&ndash;149;
Pfizenmaier 1997, 179&ndash;216). Clarke was not officially censured
(but nearly so), but it surely prevented his rising to higher clerical
office. Clarke&rsquo;s writings on the trinity are relevant for
understanding his other metaphysical positions, especially his
identification of &ldquo;person&rdquo; with intelligent, acting agent
rather than with a particular substance, which has not been
sufficiently reconciled with his account of personal identity as
explained by an immaterial soul.</p>

<p>
In Christian theology, God is represented as tripartite&mdash;three
persons but one God. In the 1662 <em>Book of Common Prayer</em>, in
use in England during Clarke&rsquo;s lifetime, one of the liturgies
draws from the Athanasian Creed, which includes the following
discussion of the Trinity: &ldquo;For there is one Person of the
Father, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost. But the
Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all
one&hellip; So the Father is God, the Son is God : and the Holy Ghost
is God. And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.&rdquo; In his
position as a cleric, Clarke was required to subscribe to this
formulation. In 1712, against the advice of his friends, he published
<em>The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity</em>, in which he diverged
from what his opponents considered the plain sense of this
formulation. <em>The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity</em> begins by
collecting all the passages of the New Testament that relate to the
Trinity. It then sets out a series of 55 propositions regarding the
Trinity, each supported by references to the texts collected in the
first section and writings from the early Christian church. The
biblical texts do not primarily discuss God&rsquo;s metaphysical
attributes, according to Clarke, but ascribe dominion to God (W 4.150;
Snobelen 2004, 265&ndash;275). The third section relates these
propositions to the Anglican liturgy. This approach reflects
Clarke&rsquo;s general expectation that the correct theological
doctrines are found in the Bible, are endorsed by the early church,
and are compatible with reason. Through hundreds of years of what he
considered bad metaphysics, the correct and intelligible doctrine of
the trinity had become obscured, and Clarke hoped to return to a
pre-Athanasian understanding of the trinity.</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s position in <em>The Scripture-Doctrine of the
Trinity</em> was labeled by his opponents as &ldquo;Arian,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Socinian,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sabellian.&rdquo; Although they
were commonly used as abusive terms for anyone holding non-traditional
or anti-trinitarian views, they also have more precise meanings. An
Arian holds that the Son (the second person of the Trinity) is divine
but not eternal; he was created by God the Father out of nothing
before the beginning of the world. A Socinian holds that the Son is
merely human and was created at or after the conception of Jesus. A
Sabellian holds that the Son is a mode of God. In the precise use of
the terms, Clarke is none of these. Unlike the Arians, Clarke affirmed
that the Son is co-eternal with the Father and not created (W 4.141).
(Pfizenmaier 1997 provides further textual and historical arguments
that Clarke should not be classified as an Arian.) From this it also
follows that, <em>contra</em> the Socinians, the Son existed before
the conception of Jesus. Unlike the Sabellians, Clarke denied that the
Son was a mode of the Father. (This would have been very problematic
given that he sometimes claimed that space is a mode of God.)
Clarke&rsquo;s claimed ignorance about substance made him reluctant to
declare that the Father and the Son were the same divine substance,
but the Son is endowed by the Father with all of the power and
authority of the Father. He also called the manner of the Son&rsquo;s
generation from the father &ldquo;ineffable.&rdquo; So while Clarke
denied that the trinity was a &ldquo;mystery,&rdquo; he did believe
that the manner in which the Father&rsquo;s power is communicated to
the Son is &ldquo;after a manner to us unknown&rdquo; (Proposition 35;
4.159).</p>

<p>
Clarke affirms that each member of the trinity is a person, but only
the Father is self-existent, which means that the Father by essence
(rather than by &ldquo;office&rdquo;) has a property that the Son does
not. His views are best described as subordinationist, but he could
also be called a unitarian, in at least some senses of the term (Tuggy
2014;
 204&ndash;205).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="Mira">4.4 Miracles</h3>

<p>
Like many associated with the Royal Society, Clarke thought that
miracles could be used as evidence for the claim that Christianity is
the true religion. However, given that matter is inactive, God is
actively involved in all interactions between bodies. What then could
separate out a particular action of God as miraculous? According to
Clarke, a miracle is a &ldquo;work effected in a manner
<em>unusual</em>, or different from the common and regular Method of
Providence, by the interposition either of God himself, or of some
Intelligent Agent superior to Man, for the Proof or Evidence of some
particular Doctrine, or in attestation to the Authority of some
particular Person&rdquo; (W 2.701). This became a point of controversy
in the letters that passed between Clarke and Leibniz (L
3.13&ndash;116, W 4.605). One focus of the debate is which would be
greater: a world so perfectly crafted that God does not need to
intervene to keep it running (Leibniz), or a world so dependent on God
that one cannot understand the world without recognizing its continual
dependence on the operations of God (Clarke). A second focus of the
debate is the proper understanding of a miracle: something that
exceeds the natural power of created things (Leibniz), or something
that seems different from our human expectation of how things operate
(Clarke).</p>

<p>
Clarke maintains that miracles are miraculous only from a human
perspective and that God and other immaterial agents actively and
continuously work in the physical world because matter is completely
passive. Because God&rsquo;s wisdom and goodness are unchanging, if
God chooses to act differently in the world at a certain time (e.g.,
by changing the laws of motion), it is only because it was always good
to do so and was part of God&rsquo;s plan from eternity. Because it
requires no more power for God to do the miraculous-to-us as to do the
natural-to-us, neither one is &ldquo;with Respect to <em>God</em>,
more or less <em>Natural</em> or <em>Supernatural</em> than the
other.&rdquo; From our perspective, God is changing the order of
things; from God&rsquo;s perspective, everything is equally part of
God&rsquo;s design. A miracle, then, is only a miracle &ldquo;with
Regard to <em>our Conceptions</em>&rdquo; (C2.6&ndash;12, W
4.598&ndash;601). In his final letter Clarke elaborates on this,
suggesting that we call the sun stopping in the sky miraculous only
because it is unusual; if it was always at the same point in the sky,
then that would be natural, and its motion miraculous. Similarly,
raising a dead body from the ground is miraculous only because God
does not usually act that way (C5.107&ndash;109, W 4.693; C3.17, W
4.611&ndash;612). Unusualness is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for being a miracle (C4.43, W 4.629&ndash;630), but Clarke
nowhere says what else is required.</p>

<p>
Leibniz attacks Clarke&rsquo;s position from multiple angles.
Leibniz&rsquo;s first letter accuses Newton of making an imperfect
machine that requires tuning to keep it running, like a watch that
requires winding, which is unfitting a perfect God. In Newton&rsquo;s
world, miracles are required &ldquo;in order to supply the Wants of
Nature&rdquo; (L1.4, W 4.588). Clarke responds that there is a
disanalogy between the watch and the world. The watch requires winding
because a human watchmaker can only compose parts and put them in
motion, whereas God is both the creator and preserver of forces and
powers. On the offensive, Clarke charges those who deny God&rsquo;s
constant involvement in the world to be allowing a mechanical world, a
world of &ldquo;<em>Materialism</em> and <em>Fate</em>,&rdquo; where
God is not needed at all (C1.4, W 4.590). In response, Leibniz makes
the interesting objection that either Clarke is explaining natural
things by the supernatural, which is absurd, or else God is a part of
nature (specifically, the soul of the world) (L2.12, W 4.596;
L4.110&ndash;11, W 4.666). Leibniz also charges that Clarke cannot
explain the difference between natural and supernatural action.
&ldquo;But it is <em>regular</em>, (says the Author,) it is
<em>constant</em>, and consequently <em>natural</em>. I answer; it
cannot be regular, without being reasonable; nor natural, unless it
can be explained by the Natures of creatures&rdquo; (L5.121, W
4.668&ndash;669). Regularities require explanations, and to be natural
these explanations must come from the natures of the creatures. The
Clarkean picture, in which matter is completely passive, is incapable
of explaining the regularities exhibited in the interaction of
material bodies in terms of those bodies. Whereas Clarke saw this as
the pinnacle of what natural philosophy contributes to natural
theology, Leibniz saw it as a failure to exhibit a fully rational
world suited to being created by a perfectly good God.</p>

<h3 id="ReveFourCateDeis">4.5 Revelation and the Four Categories of Deism</h3>

<p>
Clarke was confident in the prospects of general revelation; human
reason is capable of discovering the existence and attributes of God
by reasoning from the evidence of nature. Many theological and ethical
truths (e.g., there is a God, God is to be worshiped, it is good to be
just and righteous) are plainly understandable to everyone, and if one
is mistaken in these matters &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not by his
<em>Understanding</em>, but by his <em>Will</em> that he is
deceived.&rdquo; Yet it is very common to oppose these truths; the
most common causes are &ldquo;a <em>presumptuous</em> Ignorance, which
<em>despises</em> Knowledge&rdquo;; carelessness, which leads to
blindly following local customs; prejudice, which is relying
implicitly on others and traditions rather than an examination of the
evidence; and vice, a willful opposition to the truth due to the love
of wickedness, debauchery, and power (W 2.147&ndash;160). The reasoned
defense of natural religion, although perhaps unable to sway the
prejudiced, was central to Clarke&rsquo;s project. He even suggests
that Christianity presupposes natural religion (LCC 813, W 4.582).</p>

<p>
Clarke thought deists could be convinced to abandon their position
because deism is unstable. In Clarke&rsquo;s taxonomy, there are four
categories of deists (W 2.600ff). The first group say they believe in
&ldquo;an Eternal, Infinite, Independent, Intelligent Being&rdquo;
that made the world, but this God is not involved in the governing of
the world nor does God care for what happens in it. In response,
Clarke argues (1) that the best science of the day has shown that the
nature of matter is insufficient to ground the laws by which matter
acts and thus requires the continuous dependence upon its Creator and
(2) a God that isn&rsquo;t concerned for what happens in the world
must be lacking in knowledge of what is happening, power to affect
what is happening, ability to act in the world, or wisdom to know that
intervention is needed, and thus is not the God that the deist claimed
to accept. The second group accept providential action in the world,
but deny that God has moral attributes; ethics is a matter of human
construction. Clarke claims they fail to see (1) that ethics is a
matter of eternal, fixed relations and (2) that to deny the moral
attributes of God entails the denial of either God&rsquo;s wisdom or
power. The third group affirm God&rsquo;s moral attributes, but they
deny the immortality of the human soul and that moral terms apply
univocally between God and humans, which in practice leads to the
denial of a future state after death. Clarke claims that this explodes
all the attributes of God so that we no longer know what we are saying
when we talk about God. Finally, some deists hold the correct
theological and ethical doctrines, but claim that they know this
solely on the basis of general revelation and thus have no need of a
special, Christian revelation. Clarke suspects that this fourth
category of deists no longer exist in lands where Christianity has
reached.</p>

<h2 id="Ethi">5. Ethics</h2>

<p>
Although some of his sermons contain interesting analyses of
individual virtues, the most sustained exposition of Clarke&rsquo;s
deontological, rationalist ethics is contained in his second set of
Boyle Lectures, <em>A Discourse Concerning the Unalterable Obligations
of Natural Religion</em>. Clarke begins by stating that clearly there
are different relations among persons and that from these relations
there arises a &ldquo;fitness&rdquo; or &ldquo;unfitness&rdquo; of
behavior among persons. So, for example, given the relation of
infinite disproportion between humans and God, it is fit that we
honor, worship, and imitate God. These facts can be rationally
apprehended by anyone with a sound mind, although in some cases we may
be at a loss in clearly demarcating right from wrong. Being grounded
in necessary relations, ethical truths are universal and necessary. As
such, they are independent of any will, divine or human, and of any
calculation of punishment or reward.</p>

<p>
In somewhat more detail, the central tenets of Clarke&rsquo;s ethics
are elucidated in the subordinate components of the first proposition
of <em>A Discourse</em>.</p>

<ol>

<li>There are eternal and necessary differences (or
&ldquo;reasons&rdquo;) of things, from which &ldquo;necessarily arises
an <em>agreement</em> or <em>disagreement</em> of some things with
others, or a <em>fitness</em> or <em>unfitness</em> of the application
of different things or different relations one to another&rdquo; (W
2.608).</li>

<li>God wills to act according to these eternal reasons of things (W
2.612).</li>

<li>All rational creatures should choose to act according to the
eternal rule of reason (by which Clarke seems to mean these eternal
relations) (W 2.612), and the human mind &ldquo;naturally and
necessarily Assents to the eternal Law of Righteousness&rdquo; (W
2.616).</li>

<li>This eternal law is classified into piety (duty toward God),
righteousness (duty to other human persons), and sobriety (duty to
oneself) (W 2.618).</li>

<li>This law is temporally and logically prior to and independent of
human interaction (W 2.624).</li>

<li>This law is also logically prior to and independent of the will of
God (W 2.626).</li>

<li>The obligation to follow this law is &ldquo;antecedent to all
Consideration of any particular private and personal Reward or
Punishment&rdquo; (W 2.627).</li>
</ol>

<p>
From (3) and in clarification of sobriety and piety in (4), Clarke
argues the ideal created moral agent is one who acts within the scope
of what God, with full authority and compatibly with reason, has
commanded. For instance, we ought to preserve our own being because
God has created us and sustains us and only God ought to remove us
from the world (Heydt 2018, 135). Regarding (4), Clarke argues that
duties toward others are governed by equity, which demands that one
deal with other persons as one can reasonably expect others to deal
with one (W 2.619), and by love, which demands that one further the
well-being happiness of all persons (W 2.621). Duties towards oneself
demand that one preserve one&rsquo;s physical health, mental
faculties, and spiritual well-being so as to be able to perform
one&rsquo;s duties (W 2.623). Clarke uses (5) as an opportunity to
develop a series of interesting attacks on Hobbes&rsquo; account of
political and moral obligation. Among his many criticisms, he argues
that a social contract cannot be obligatory unless there were already
an obligation to obey contracts; if a contract benefits the community
then there are real benefits prior to the contract so the contract
does not generate benefits and harms; it is a contradiction for
everyone to have a right to the same thing in the state of nature; and
if power is to be obeyed then an all-powerful devil should be obeyed,
which is absurd (W 2.609&ndash;616, 631&ndash;638). In clarification
of (6), Clarke adds that, because God always does what is just and
good, God&rsquo;s commands align with the eternal law (W 2.637), and
that, because God wants to make us happy and good, God promotes the
goodness and welfare of the whole of creation, including us (W 2.640).
While the law is antecedent to considerations of reward and punishment
(7), God&rsquo;s justice ensures the proper rewards and punishments
for following the law (W 2.641). These sanctions are not uniformly
present in this life, so the reward and punishment must at least
partly occur in the next life. Moreover, human depravity makes the
prospect of future sanctions a necessary incentive for proper
behavior. God might also ensure that our acting from the best reasons
does not have overall much worse consequences (Schneewind 1997,
317).</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s theory has been criticized on several grounds,
especially on the meaning and sufficiency of (1). He never adequately
explained the nature of the relations among persons that ground
morality. For instance, his explanation for why it is
&ldquo;fit&rdquo; to honor, worship, obey, and imitate God is that
&ldquo;<em>God</em> is infinitely superior to <em>Men</em>&rdquo; (W
2.608). If the infinite superiority is in reference to power or being,
it is not obviously to the point; if it is an expression of an ethical
relation, the argument is circular. Additionally, it is unclear what
in the &ldquo;Nature and Reason of Things&rdquo; is necessary. Is it
that good is necessarily not evil? (This is trivial and unhelpful.) Is
it that one thing cannot be both good from one perspective and evil
from another? (In which case, Clarke is offering a response to Hobbes
or maybe Spinoza, but he doesn&rsquo;t provide a substantial
alternative.) Is it that whatever is good is necessarily good? (In
which case, he is perhaps restating his opposition to divine command
theory, but again not in a way that makes clear his alternative.) Is
it something else? Clarke&rsquo;s position is not clear, but he does
seem to affirm each of these interpretations at different times.
Frances Hutcheson argued that to make sense of Clarke&rsquo;s theory
of fitness, one needed to supplement it with Hutcheson&rsquo;s own
moral sense theory (Boeker 2022, 154&ndash;157). Similarly, Hume
(1739, 3.1.1.3&ndash;7) charged theories like Clarke&rsquo;s with
motivational impotence because the perception of &ldquo;fitness&rdquo;
cannot, by itself, move the will. However, Clarke denied that
evaluation causes motivation, although he clearly thought that
evaluation provides the agent, who ultimately causes the volition,
with reasons for action. A further structural problem is that Clarke
slides between (1) the claim that ethical truths are relations between
mind-independent objects in the world and (2) the claim that they are
grounded in the nature of rationality itself, apparently without
distinguishing the two positions. Relatedly, there is an interpretive
question about whether Clarke is ontologically committed to the
existence of mind-independent values that are not reducible to
anything in the world (Kelly 2002, Sheridan 2007, Boeker 2022).</p>

<h2 id="InflRece">6. Influence and Reception</h2>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s influence on his contemporaries and the generation that
followed was immense. As the translator of the standard textbook in
physics in England in the early eighteenth
 century,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 as the defender of Newton&rsquo;s natural philosophy in the
correspondence with Leibniz, as the translator of Newton&rsquo;s
<em>Opticks</em> into Latin, and as a recognized close friend of
Newton, Clarke was perhaps the most significant spokesperson for the
Newtonian natural philosophy, and a primary interpreter of its
implications for metaphysics, philosophy of science, and theology. In
particular, his use of the passivity and scarcity of matter in his
argument for the existence of God was noted by his contemporaries
internationally.</p>

<p>
Clarke&rsquo;s influence was greatest in England and Scotland, where
all of his works were widely read. Daniel Waterland was his sharpest
contemporary critic, but the two remained friendly throughout
(Ferguson 1976, 217). A. A. Sykes and John Jackson were Clarke&rsquo;s
most forceful defenders in the 1710s and 1720s. Clarke often made
suggestions to Jackson about how best to defend his views (Ferguson
1976, 218&ndash;219). Among those sympathetic to Clarke&rsquo;s
methodology and positions in the next two generations, Andrew Baxter
was the most polemical, John Stewart the most irritating to Hume,
Richard Price the most similar, and Thomas Reid the most well known
today. Clarke&rsquo;s ethics (with some metaphysical support) were
defended by William Wollaston and Catharine Trotter Cockburn (see
Thomas 2017, 210ff; Boeker 2022), criticized and supplemented by
Joseph Butler (Yajima 2024), and attacked by David Hume (see Greenberg
2013, 251ff). There has been comparatively little work on Clarke and
Berkeley, but see Schliesser 2020 on the role of order, structure, and
parts in nature.</p>

<p>
Clarke profoundly influenced philosophers in the eighteenth century
that had interests in the intersection of theology and philosophy,
particularly on the freedom of the will and the relationship between
God, space, and matter. Jonathan Edwards singled out Clarke as a major
opponent in his <em>Freedom of the Will</em>, where Edwards runs
together libertarianism with Arminian theology (which requires that a
free choice of the will is necessary for receiving God&rsquo;s saving
grace). That same libertarianism made Clarke popular among the German
Pietists. Among them, Crusius is the most notable, both for his work
and for his importance to Kant, and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence
is a likely source for Kant&rsquo;s discussions of space and time.
(See the entry on
 <a href="../kant-spacetime/">Kant&rsquo;s Views on Space and Time</a>.)
 Voltaire (1752) declared, &ldquo;Among these philosophers [the last
generation of British philosophers], Clarke is perhaps altogether the
clearest, the most profound, the most methodical, and the strongest of
all those who have spoken of the Supreme Being.&rdquo; Voltaire as a
young man was particularly impressed with Clarke; later in life, he
seems to have been less convinced by Clarke&rsquo;s argument for the
existence of God. Recent work has shown Clarke&rsquo;s influence on
Emilie du Ch&acirc;telet&rsquo;s theory of freedom, although whether
she was influenced by the <em>Demonstration</em> or only the
correspondence with Leibniz and whether she was a libertarian are
disputed (Hutton, 2012, Jorati 2019, Wells 2021). In <em>Emile</em>,
Rousseau refers to &ldquo;the illustrious Clarke enlightening the
world, proclaiming at last the Being of beings and the Dispenser of
things,&rdquo; but whether Rousseau was steadfastly sympathetic to
Clarke&rsquo;s system is in doubt (Attfield 2004, 433&ndash;434).</p>

<p>
In his <em>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</em>, Hume has Demea
recite the argument <em>a priori</em> and both Cleanthes and Philo
offer critiques. Clarke is cited by name in <em>Treatise</em> 1.3.3
and is a likely object of the arguments against ethical rationalism in
<em>Treatise</em> 3.1. In <em>A Letter from a Gentleman</em> (1745),
Hume (or possibly Kames; the authorship is disputed) admits that
Clarke&rsquo;s argument <em>a priori</em> is undermined by the claims
of the <em>Treatise</em>. Russell (1997 and 2008) has proposed that
Clarke is a major target of Hume&rsquo;s <em>Treatise</em>, and that
Hume&rsquo;s opposition to natural theology as defended by Clarke is a
uniting theme of the <em>Treatise</em>. Recent work on Mary Shepherd
engages Hume on the points in metaphysics and ethics on which he is
most critical of Clarke (e.g., Bolton 2019, Landy 2020).</p>

<p>
In 1778, Richard Price could still write on behalf of many that
&ldquo;Dr. Clarke is, without all doubt, the best and ablest of all
writers, on the subjects of the Immateriality and Natural Immortality
of the Soul, and also on Liberty and Necessity,&rdquo; but by the
nineteenth century interest in and appreciation of Clarke had
dwindled. Samuel Coleridge (1854, 405) considered him
&ldquo;over-rated,&rdquo; and Leslie Stephen (1881, 119) claimed that
to nineteenth-century eyes, Clarke &ldquo;appears to be a second-rate
advocate of opinions interesting only in the mouths of greater men who
were their first and ablest advocates.&rdquo; Henry Sidgwick (1886,
175&ndash;180), despite his criticisms, is a nineteenth-century
exception in holding Clarke in high regard.</p>

<p>
In the last few decades, a renewed interest in Clarke&rsquo;s argument
<em>a priori</em>, a rediscovery of Newton&rsquo;s unpublished
writings and subsequent study of his associates, and a greater
appreciation for Clarke&rsquo;s historical importance to ethics,
metaphysics, and more have philosophers reading Clarke again, and the
estimation of his philosophical acuity has increased.</p>
