<h1>Identity Over Time</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Mar 18, 2005; substantive revision Mon Jan 12, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The problem of identity through time can be introduced by noting that
the following two statements both seem true but, on the assumption
that change is real, appear to be inconsistent:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
If an object really changes, then there can&rsquo;t literally be one
and the same thing before and after the change.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If there isn&rsquo;t literally one and the same object before and
after a change, then no one object has really undergone any
change.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Traditionally, this puzzle has been solved in various ways. Aristotle,
for example, distinguished between &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; and
&ldquo;essential&rdquo; changes. Accidental changes are ones that
don&rsquo;t result in a change in an objects&rsquo; identity after the
change, such as when a house is painted, or one&rsquo;s hair turns
gray, etc. Aristotle thought of these as changes in the accidental
properties of a thing. By contrast, change with respect to the
essential properties of an object don&rsquo;t preserve the identity of
the object. These &ldquo;changes&rdquo; are, in fact, destructions of
the earlier thing, such as when a house burns to the ground and ashes
remain. Armed with these distinctions, Aristotle would then say that,
in the case of accidental changes, (1) is false&mdash;a thing can
really change one of its &ldquo;accidental properties&rdquo; and yet
literally remain one and the same thing before and after the change.
(See the entry on
 <a href="../essential-accidental/">essential vs. accidental properties</a>.)
 Which properties a thing has accidentally and which essentially
depends on what kind of object it is, on what its form is. According
to this view known as hylomorphism, an object is more than its matter;
it is a combination of matter and form.</p>

<p>
Of course, this solution to the puzzle depends on there being a
coherent distinction between accidental and essential changes, and
between accidental and essential properties. Some philosophers find
this distinction problematic and have developed other solutions that
don&rsquo;t require this distinction. Others appeal to the distinction
but claim to discard its problematic features. In what follows, we
discuss these solutions to the puzzle, along with other puzzles that
arise when considering the identity of objects over time.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
As a number of philosophers have remarked, one of the many puzzles
about identity, given its apparent simplicity, is why it proves so
puzzling. Indeed, one pervasive sentiment is that identity cannot pose
any philosophical problems. Anything that looks like a problem about
identity must really be a problem about something else. David Lewis
gives striking expression to this sentiment when he says:</p>

<blockquote>
More important, we should not suppose that we have here any problem
about <em>identity</em>. We never have. Identity is utterly simple and
unproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever
identical to anything except itself. There is never any problem about
what makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to be.
(Lewis 1986, 192&ndash;193)
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite that, problems about identity appear to play a central role in
a large number of philosophical issues whose discussion dates back to
the ancient world. One of the most venerable concerns identity and
change. Something undergoes change, yet continues to exist and be
itself. The same pan is at one time cold, another time hot. How can
something be both identical and different from one time to another? At
first sight this problem evaporates once we draw a well-known
distinction between <em>numerical</em> and <em>qualitative</em>
identity. To say that \(a\) and \(b\) are qualitatively identical is
to say that \(a\) exactly resembles \(b\). To say that \(a\) and \(b\)
are numerically identical is, at least, to say \(a\) and \(b\) are one
thing and not two (despite the misleadingly plural grammar). Whether
\(a\) and \(b\) can have <em>all</em> their properties in common
without being numerically identical is controversial. However, change
seems to be the case when \(a\) is numerically identical with \(b\)
without being qualitatively identical with it, that is, when \(a\) and
\(b\) have different properties at different times.</p>

<p>
Some find the idea of the very same thing having different properties
at different times problematic. (See the problem of temporary
intrinsics discussed below.) Setting that general problem aside, there
are special cases of it that generate some of the most intractable
issues about identity. One results from persisting things putatively
having different parts at different times. Consider an object capable
of changing its parts, such as a cup at a time when its handle is
still attached. At that time the cup appears to consist of the
following two parts: a smaller one, its handle, and a larger one
consisting of the rest of the cup. Call the larger of these parts the
truncated cup. The cup, otherwise unscathed, proceeds to lose its
handle. At the earlier time, with its handle still intact, the cup is
surely distinct from the truncated cup. Later, after the removal of
the cup&rsquo;s handle, the cup spatially coincides with the truncated
cup. Each object is, at the later time, composed from exactly the same
atoms. As one philosopher has put it about a different example, at the
later time the cup and the truncated cup are as alike as one pea in a
pod (Denis Robinson, in conversation). Should we say that the cup and
truncated cup are earlier distinct, but later identical? The problem
is that saying so arguably conflicts with a fundamental principle
governing identity called Leibniz&rsquo;s Law.</p>

<p>
Leibniz is responsible for articulating two principles that, he
claims, are constitutive of identity. The first, more controversial,
of these, called the identity of indiscernibles, says that qualitative
indiscernibility implies identity. The second, often referred to as
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law or the Indiscernibility of Identicals, says that
identity implies qualitative indiscernibility. According to
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, if \(a\) is identical with \(b\), every quality
of \(a\) will be a quality of \(b\). (See the entry on
 <a href="../identity-indiscernible/">identity of indiscernibles</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Here are two ways in which, it seems, saying that the cup is earlier
distinct from, but later identical with, the truncated cup conflicts
with Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Ostensibly one of the cup&rsquo;s later
properties is having earlier had a handle. That is a property the
truncated cup never has. So, identifying the later cup and truncated
cup appears to violate Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. There is, at least, one
property, having formerly had a handle, that the cup and truncated cup
never have in common.</p>

<p>
Here is a second way in which the claim that the cup and truncated cup
are sometimes, but not always, identical appears to violate
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Let us bestow a name on the cup. Call it
&lsquo;Cup&rsquo;. Let us also call the truncated cup
&lsquo;Tcup&rsquo;. We are envisaging that Cup is sometimes, but not
always, identical with Tcup. Leibniz&rsquo;s Law tells us that Cup and
Tcup share all their properties at any time they are identical. Some
properties are referred to as <em>modal</em> properties. A modal
property is the property of <em>possibly</em> or <em>necessarily</em>
having some further property. Modal properties include such properties
as being possibly red, necessarily extended, possibly taller than a
giraffe, or necessarily cup shaped. Arguably one of Cup&rsquo;s modal
properties is the property of <em>being necessarily identical with
Cup</em>. Suppose Cup and Tcup are at some time identical. In that
case, by Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, Tcup will, at some time, share with Cup
the modal property of being necessarily identical with Cup. So, if Cup
is ever identical with Tcup, then Tcup has the modal property of being
necessarily identical with Cup. But if Tcup is necessarily identical
with Cup, there can be no time when Tcup is distinct from Cup.</p>

<p>
Let us say that the identity of \(a\) with \(b\) is <em>temporary</em>
if \(a\) is sometimes, but not always, identical with \(b\). Later we
shall look at other types of puzzle cases that provide some motivation
for countenancing temporary identity. Despite the existence of such
cases, the majority of philosophers are reluctant to allow temporary
identity principally because of the putative conflict with
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Instead, to deal with puzzles about identity
through time a wide range of alternatives have been proposed. These
include: maintaining that Cup is later constituted by Tcup (where
constitution does not imply identity); denying that Tcup is earlier a
proper part of Cup; maintaining that Cup and Tcup are never identical,
but only share a later temporal part in common; maintaining that Cup
and Tcup are never identical but are two distinct things that take up
the same space, coinciding fully after the handle loss, holding that
the identity between the earlier Tcup and later Cup is not literal,
but only loose and popular.</p>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, while not controversial, would seem to be at odds
with change since change requires a qualitative difference alongside
numerically identity. This appearance is dispelled one we distinguish
<em>synchronic</em> and <em>diachronic</em> numerical identity. By
synchronic identity we mean numerical identity holding at a single
time. By diachronic identity we mean numerical identity holding
between something existing at one time and something existing at
another. Leibniz&rsquo; Law straightforwardly holds for synchronic
identity. One question is whether synchronic and diachronic identity
are different kinds of identity. Some philosophers are willing to
countenance different kinds of identity. Others are reluctant to do
so. One philosopher who is willing to postulate a multiplicity of
different kinds of identity is Peter Geach. Geach, among others, has
addressed puzzles about both synchronic and diachronic identity by
denying that there is a single absolute relation of identity rather
than a host of relative identity relations. On this view we cannot
simply say that \(a\) is identical with \(b\). Instead there must be a
concept of a kind of thing, a so called <em>sortal</em> concept, that
serves to answer the question: \(a\) is the same <em>what</em> as
\(b\)? This is so, according to the champions of relative identity,
because the following can happen: \(a\) and \(b\) both fall under the
sortal concepts \(F\) and \(G, a\) is the same \(F\) as \(b\), but
\(a\) is not the same \(G\) as \(b\) (Geach 1967, and see the entry on
 <a href="../identity-relative/">relative identity</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Consider the case of Cup and Tcup. Is Cup at the later time \(t'\)
identical with Tcup? Is Tcup at \(t'\) identical with Tcup at \(t\)? A
relative identity theorist would deny that these questions have
answers. For such a theorist to have an answerable question we would
need to replace, for example, the first with: At \(t'\) is Cup the
same <em>cup as</em> Tcup?</p>

<p>
How could insisting on the relativity of the answer to an identity
question to a kind help with the diachronic identity puzzle posed by
Cup and Tcup? Here is one way that it could. Suppose that nothing is a
cup when it is a proper part of a cup. Then Tcup fails to qualify as a
cup at \(t\) when it is a proper part of Cup. In that case a relative
identity theorist can say the following. At the later time \(t'\) Cup
is the same cup as Tcup. Since Tcup is not a cup at the earlier time
\(t\), neither Cup nor Tcup at \(t'\) is the same cup as Tcup at
\(t\). Moreover, for any kind \(K\), Cup is not the same \(K\) as Tcup
at \(t\). Identifying Cup with Tcup as the same cup at \(t'\) places
us under no constraint to identify Cup with one of its proper parts,
Tcup, at \(t\).</p>

<p>
Some of those who reject relative identity nevertheless accept that
\(a\) cannot be identical with \(b\), unless there is a more specific
answer to the question whether \(a\) is the same <em>thing</em> as
\(b\). Many philosophers distinguish between two kinds of concepts
which are applicable to whatever can persist through time. One kind is
illustrated by the concepts of gold (as opposed to a quantity or piece
of gold), snow, or rain. In the case of any such concept \(F\), there
is no answer to the question: how many \(F\)s are there? In contrast,
in the case of other concepts such as the concept of a horse, a tall
person, an artwork, or a statue there is an answer to the question:
how many \(F\)s are there? For example, though we may not know it,
there is an answer to the question: how many statues are there?
Concepts of this last kind are often referred to as sortal concepts.
Those who take the view that the question whether \(a\) is the same as
\(b\) is illegitimate, unless it is construed as elliptical for the
question whether \(a\) is the same thing of such and such a kind as
\(b\) typically also hold the following views. We should distinguish
between two types of sortal concepts: <em>phase</em> sortals and
<em>substance</em> sortals. A phase sortal such as child, utensil or
prize is a concept that something can cease to fall under without
ceasing to exist. If, in contrast, something falls under a substance
sortal, it must always do so. If \(a\) at some time \(t\) is the same
as \(b\) at the same, or a different time \(t'\), it must, say
advocates of the view in question, be that, for some sortal \(S, a\)
at \(t\) is the same \(S\) as \(b\) at \(t'\). For example, if
John&rsquo;s favorite artwork at \(t\) is identical with Sally&rsquo;s
most valuable possession at \(t'\), there must be a substance sortal,
the concept of a statue as it may be, under which John&rsquo;s
favorite artwork at \(t\), and Sally&rsquo;s most valuable possession
at \(t'\) both fall. Moreover, a substance sortal is said to go
together with a criterion of identity where a criterion of identity
associated with substance sortal \(S\) is, <em>inter alia</em>, a
criterion for some earlier \(S\) being the same \(S\) as some later
\(S\).</p>

<p>
Finally, there are a group of issues that fall under the heading of
the dispensability of identity. According to one tradition that goes
back, at least, to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em>, we can
theoretically dispense with identity talk without loss of information.
Some, but by no means all, who take this view, do so because they hold
that the predicate &lsquo;is identical with&rsquo; corresponds to no
genuine property. Issues about the dispensability of identity engage
with issues about identity across time in the following way. This
section opened with a quote from David Lewis claiming that there is
never any philosophical problem about identity. The case of Cup and
Tcup raises what is ostensibly a problem about identity across time.
That problem only arises, it seems, because the later Cup is
putatively identical with the earlier Tcup. If the problem is not, in
part, about that putative identity holding, what is it about?</p>

<p>
According to a four dimensionalist like David Lewis, a table is
extended through the time of its life, and constituted from temporal
parts which are themselves short lived tables. As a four
dimensionalist Lewis would not hesitate to give the following answer
to the above question. The problem is not about identity, but at least
partly about whether a cup-like object that exists only at \(t'\) is
suitably related to a cup-like object that exists only at \(t\) so
that both cup-like objects are temporal stages or parts of
<em>one</em> four-dimensionally extended cup. As well, Lewis would
distinguish the four-dimensional object Cup from the four-dimensional
object Tcup, noting that they are two objects that share the same
extended temporal part after the breakage. (Lewis 1986, and see entry
on
 <a href="../temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Some philosophers are not prepared to endorse four dimensionalism but
would nevertheless agree with Lewis that Cup and Tcup are distinct
objects. While maintaining that they are three dimensional objects and
hence do not extend through time, these philosophers would say that
even after the breakage Cup and Tcup are two distinct, coinciding
objects. The biggest cost the Coincidence view, as it is sometimes
called, is that it contradicts the idea that more than one thing
cannot exist at the same place at the same time (Thomson 1983,
1998).</p>

<p>
It remains to be seen whether the putative problem about Cup and
Tcup&rsquo;s identity through time can be reformulated so that a) it
is no longer a problem about identity through time, b) does not
require adopting four dimensionalism, and c) maintains the common

<h2 id="IdeCha">2. Identity and Change</h2>

<h3 id="DiaSynIde">2.1 Diachronic and Synchronic Identity</h3>

<p>
It is customary to distinguish (numerical) identity at a time from
(numerical) identity across time. An example of an identity holding at
a single time is: the table in the next room is (now) identical with
my favorite table. An example of an identity holding across different
times is: The table in the next room is identical with the one you
purchased last year. Diachronic identities pose some of the most
intractable problems about identity. Before looking at those problems,
and some of the most frequently proposed solutions to them, let us ask
whether there is anything that distinguishes identity from other
relations.</p>

<p>
The most commonly agreed on distinguishing feature of identity is that
it conforms to the Indiscernibility of Identicals, what was earlier
called Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Taking &lsquo;\(\forall F\)&rsquo; to be a
quantifier ranging over properties, here is one way to formulate
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law:</p> 
\[\tag{LL}
\forall x\forall y[x=y \rightarrow \forall F(Fx \rightarrow Fy)]
\]

<p>
LL, understood to range over identity properties, if any, such as
<em>being identical with \(a\)</em>, says that if \(x\) is identical
with \(y\), then any property of \(x\) is a property of \(y\).</p>

<h3 id="IdeEquRel">2.2 Identity as an Equivalence Relation</h3>

<p>
A relation is a property with more than one subject place. When \(a\)
and \(b\) stand in relation \(R, a\) has the property of <em>being
R-related to b</em>. A relation \(R\) is reflexive if each thing
stands in \(R\) to itself. It is symmetrical if \(a\)&rsquo;s standing
in \(R\) to \(b\) implies that \(b\) stands in \(R\) to \(a\). It is
transitive if \(a\)&rsquo;s standing in \(R\) to \(b\) and
\(b\)&rsquo;s likewise standing in \(R\) to \(c\) together imply that
\(a\) stands in \(R\) to \(c\). Identity is trivially reflexive. Each
thing trivially stands in the relation of identity to itself. That
identity is also symmetrical and transitive follows from
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Suppose identity fails to be symmetrical, and for
some \(a\) and \(b, a\) is identical with \(b\), but \(b\) is not
identical with \(a\). In that case, \(a\) has a property, being
identical with \(b\), which \(b\) fails to have. Suppose identity is
not transitive, and, for some \(a, b\) and \(c, a\) is identical with
\(b\) and \(b\) is identical with \(c\), but \(a\) is not identical
with \(c\). In that case \(b\) has a property, being identical with
\(c\), that \(a\) lacks.</p>

<h3 id="LeiLawPosChaProTemInt">2.3 Leibniz&rsquo;s Law and the Possibility of Change: The Problem of Temporary Intrinsics</h3>

<p>
Identity through time generates a number of problems posed by puzzle
cases such as the case of Cup and Tcup. Later we will review a number
of solutions to those problems offered in the literature. One problem
about identity through time is not raised by considerations of puzzle
cases. It arises simply because persisting things can change their
intrinsic properties. For that reason it has been labeled by David
Lewis the problem of temporary intrinsics (Lewis 1986,
202&ndash;205).</p>

<p>
A decent test for distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic
properties is this. A property \(F\) is an extrinsic property of an
object \(o\) if \(o\) having \(F\) implies that something distinct
from, and not a proper part of, \(o\) exists. For example, being
married to Sally is an extrinsic property of John&rsquo;s since John
can only have that property if something, Sally, distinct from, and
not a proper part, of him exists. A property \(F\) is an intrinsic
property of \(o\) if and only if \(o\) having \(F\) is compatible with
nothing apart from \(o\) and its proper parts existing, and also
compatible with something apart from \(o\) existing. For example, the
property of being round is an intrinsic property because a surface
\(S\) having that property is compatible with nothing other than \(S\)
and its proper parts existing. Here is one reason why this is only a
rough way of drawing the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic
properties. It looks as though the property of existing in complete
isolation, which Lewis calls loneliness, is extrinsic. Nevertheless
being, in this sense, lonely is not only compatible with, but requires
that nothing else exists. (For more discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="../intrinsic-extrinsic/">intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Suppose some object, a metal plate we will call Plate, changes from
being round at \(t_1\) to being square at \(t_2\). How can that be?
After all, though something can have a round part and a square part,
nothing can be round and square. No problem, you might say. Nothing
can be round and square at a single time, place and world. But
something can be round at one time and square at another.</p>

<p>
According to Lewis the original problem of temporary intrinsics
remains, unless we can show how something can have incompatible
properties at different times. To show how that can be so we need to
give at least a partial answer to the following question. What is it
for something to have a property at a time?</p>

<h3 id="CanSol">2.4 Candidate Solutions</h3>

<p>
Lewis considers three answers to this question. According to the
first, for some object \(O\) to be \(F\) at \(t\) is for the relation
of being \(F\) to tenselessly, or timelessly, hold between \(O\) and
time \(t\). For example, for Plate to be round at \(t_1\) is for the
two-place relation of being round at to hold between Plate and
\(t_1\). Something can stand in the relation of being round at to the
earlier time \(t_1\) without standing in that relation to the later
time \(t_2\). So there is no reason to think that standing in the
relation of being round at to \(t_1\) is incompatible with standing in
the relation of being square at to \(t_2\). By transmuting the
ostensibly one-place relational properties of being round and being
square into the two-place relational properties of being round at and
being square at we can show how something can be round at one time and
square at another.</p>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo; principal objection to this first solution is that it
illicitly transforms intrinsic properties into extrinsic ones. He
takes it as evident that properties such as being round and being red
are intrinsic. Why so? Call the view that putatively one-place
intrinsic properties are two-place relational properties the
relational view. Why does Lewis so adamantly reject that view? One
difficulty with answering this question is a difficulty about locating
the source of Lewis&rsquo; disquiet with the relational view.</p>

<p>
Is it that Lewis rejects the relational view because it treats
putatively intrinsic properties as extrinsic, or because it discerns
an extra place in a putatively monadic (one-place) property? That it
is the latter is suggested by the following. The problem of temporary
intrinsics appears to arise because nothing can have the intrinsic
properties of being round and being square, unless it has those
properties at different times. The same goes for pairs of extrinsic
properties. The property of being the same height as the Eiffel Tower
is extrinsic as is the property of being different in height from the
Eiffel Tower. Something can change from being the same height as the
Eiffel Tower to being different in height from that structure even
though nothing can simultaneously have the properties of being the
same height as, and being different in height from, the Eiffel Tower.
Suppose we say that something can be the same height as the Eiffel
Tower at some time \(t_1\) without being the same height as the Eiffel
tower at some distinct time \(t_2\). In that case we appear to be
confronted with the same problem as the one that originally raised the
problem of temporary intrinsics. We are confronted with the task of
explaining what it is for something to have, in this case, the
property of being the same height as the Eiffel Tower at time \(t_1\).
If we respond, it is for the three-place relation of being the same
height as at to hold between some object, the Eiffel Tower, and time
\(t_1\) we are, treating an ostensibly two place relation as a three
place one even though we are not treating an intrinsic property as
extrinsic.</p>

<p>
Lewis considers an second explanation of what it is for an object to
have a property at a time that might be called the &lsquo;according
to&rsquo; explanation. We are used to something having a property
according to one story, but failing to have that property according to
another. If we think of a time as a set of propositions describing
what holds at that time, we can say that according to one such set
Plate is round, but according to another it is square. Even a cursory
assessment of this explanation requires exploring what propositions
are and which propositions exist, and exactly what it takes for a sets
of propositions to be a time.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless we can still acknowledge some benefits of the according
to explanation when it is combined with a view about existence and
time that has received considerable discussion in recent years. The
view is called Presentism. On the Presentist view the only things that
exist without qualification are things that presently exist. Suppose
\(t_1\), a time when Plate is round, is the present. In that case if
Plate is ever square, it either was, or will be. What is it for Plate
to be round? Given that plate is presently round what makes it the
case that Plate is round is not just that Plate is round according to
some set of propositions about the present. Instead what makes it the
case that Plate is presently round is that Plate exists and is round.
So, what makes it the case that Plate, say, will be square? Not, the
Presentist will say, this: Plate tenselessly or timelessly exists, and
will be square. So what makes it the case that Plate will be square?
Perhaps this. What makes it true that Plate will be square is that
Plate is square according to some relevant future-tensed presently
existing propositions. (A natural way to think of these is as
presently existing future-tensed truths.)</p>

<p>
Here is one reason why we might think that Presentism does not, in the
end, help with the problem of temporary intrinsics. Suppose that, at
\(t_1\), we send a spherical object forward in time to \(t_2\). At
\(t_2\) the shape of the spherical object changes so that it becomes
cylindrical. Retaining its cylindrical shape the object is sent back
to \(t_1\). Even if Presentism is true, at \(t_1\) we have an object
with incompatible intrinsic properties. Some presentists might find
this thought experiment inconceivable since, according to presentism,
there is ever only one real time, whereas time travel would seem to
require the existence of a destination distinct from the moment of
departure. Despite this apparent tension some philosophers argued that
Presentism does not contradict the possibility of time travel (see
entry on
 <a href="../time-travel/">time travel</a>,
 especially 4.1.)</p>

<p>
Of course, to embrace this combination of an according to explanation
with Presentism is to embrace just one of a number of options
available to the Presentist for giving the truthmakers of future and
past tense propositions.</p>

<p>
Whether or not a Presentist wishes to take over in this way the
&lsquo;according to&rsquo; explanation, Presentism provides a solution
to the problem of temporary intrinsics. Presentists can deny that it
follows from something at one time being round that will at another
time be square that there exists something both round and square.</p>

<p>
Lewis, we saw, denies that a sentence such as &lsquo;Plate is square
at \(t_1\)&rsquo; states something true just in case Plate stands in
the square at relation to \(t_1\). In his original exposition of the
problem of temporary intrinsics, Lewis does not consider a variety of
other ways of understanding sentences attributing ostensibly intrinsic
properties to objects at times. Here is one. Many take it that a
relation of instantiation holds between a property and its instances.
Suppose instantiation is not a two place, but, at least, a three place
relation holding between an object, property and time. If so, Plate is
round at \(t_1\) if and only if Plate stands in the instantiation
relation to the (non-relational) property of roundness and \(t_1\).
Moreover Plate standing in the instantiation relation to roundness and
\(t_1\) is clearly consistent with Plate failing to stand in the
instantiation relation to roundness and the different time
\(t_2\).</p> The key difference between this view and the relational
view that Lewis considers is the following. On the relational view we
take an ostensibly non-relational property such as being circular to
be relational and extrinsic. (It is extrinsic because having it
requires an object to stand in a relation to a time.) On the
instantiation view we are taking something, the instantiation
relation, that is already an extrinsic relation to have an extra
place. So, our intuitions about what counts as an intrinsic
non-relational property are not violated.

<p>
Alternative ways of taking &lsquo;\(a\) is red at \(t\)&rsquo; include
treating &lsquo;at \(t\)&rsquo; as an adverbial modifier, or as a
sentential operator. According to the first &lsquo;at \(t\)&rsquo;,
better written as &lsquo;at \(t\)-ly&rsquo;, is an adverbial modifier
specifying the way in which something has a property. So &lsquo;Plate
is round at \(t_1\)&rsquo; is true just in case Plate has roundness
at\(-t_1\)-ly. Plate, on this view, can be round at \(t_1\), but
square at \(t_2\) because Plate can have roundness at \(t_1\)-ly
without having roundness at\(-t_2\)-ly (See Johnston 1987, Haslanger
1989).</p>

<p>
According to the temporal operator view &lsquo;at \(t_1\)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;at \(t_2\)&rsquo; should be understood as the temporal
operators: &lsquo;at \(t_1\) it is true that &hellip;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;at \(t_2\) it is true that &hellip;&rsquo;. Just as &lsquo;it
is possible that Plate is round&rsquo; is consistent with &lsquo;it is
possible that Plate is square&rsquo; so &lsquo;at \(t_1\) it is true
that Plate is round&rsquo; is consistent with &lsquo;at \(t_2\) it is
true that Plate is square&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Solutions to the problem of temporary intrinsics abound. Here is
another that treats being true and being false as three place
relations between propositions, facts and times. Consider the
propositions:</p>

<p class="indent">
(i) Plate is round,</p>

<p>
And:</p>

<p class="indent">
(ii) Plate is square.</p>

<p>
We should distinguish between a property of a proposition, and a
property that is a constituent of a proposition. Being a proposition
is a property of (i), but is not a constituent of (i). In contrast,
being round is a constituent of (i), but is not a property of (i).
Propositions have no shape. Can we hold that (i) and (ii) are both
true compatibly with taking roundness and squareness to be intrinsic
properties?</p>

<p>
It is plausible to suppose that that the truth value of a proposition
such as (i) or (ii) depends on the existence of something distinct
from that proposition. Since that is so, let us, as some adherents of
a correspondence theory of truth would do, allow that if (i), say, is
true, it has a relational property of being true. For example being
true may be a relation that holds between (i) and the fact that Plate
is round.</p>

<p>
How many places are there in what we may call the truth relation? It
is often thought to be a two place relation. Suppose that is wrong,
and truth is a three place relation holding between a proposition,
fact and time. In that case, the three place relation of truth can
hold between (i), the fact that Plate is round, and \(t_1\), without
holding between (i), the same fact and \(t_2\).</p>

<p>
Of course whether this is a solution to the problem of temporary
intrinsics depends on what that problem is. It is a solution if the
problem is to explain time indexing without turning intrinsic into
extrinsic properties. After all, no correspondence theorist would
allow that truth is an intrinsic property. (On the correspondence
theory, see entry on
 <a href="../truth/">truth</a>.)
 It is not a solution if the problem is to explain time indexing
without adding extra places to, it may be, relational properties.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we can follow Haslanger in Haslanger 1989 and Lowe in
Lowe 1987 and treat the relevant propositions as <em>tensed</em>. A
change in an intrinsic property corresponds, on this view, to a change
in the tense of a proposition attributing that property.</p>

<p>
Lewis (2002) objects to this last solution on the grounds that a
tensed proposition should itself be identified with a relational
property. But, such identification leaves it unexplained how something
can change its non-relational intrinsic properties. Ben Caplan in
Caplan 2005 has replied to Lewis that Lewis&rsquo;s objection depends
on a view about propositions that is not compulsory.</p>

<p>
Lewis favors a different solution to the problem of temporary
intrinsics (Lewis 1986). Whether or not there is a problem with the
same object being round and square, there is no problem with the same
object having a round part and a square part. To solve the problem of
temporary intrinsics, Lewis invokes the view that, in addition to
their spatial parts, objects have temporal parts, the shortest lived,
instantaneous, ones of which are called stages. This allows him to
hold that Plate is round at \(t_1\) and square at \(t_2\) because
Plate has a round part at \(t_1\) and a square part at \(t_2\).
Plate&rsquo;s round \(t_1\) part exists only at \(t_1\), and
Plate&rsquo;s square \(t_2\) part exists only at \(t_2\). Hence there
is no problem posed by either temporal part changing its shape. Plate
itself is an object consisting of a suitably interrelated sequence of
such temporal parts. For the \(t_1\) temporal part of Plate to be
round is just for it to be round. For the longer lived Plate to be
round at \(t_1\) is for Plate to be appropriately related to a round
temporal part at \(t_1\).</p>

<p>
As we have seen, in invoking temporal parts or stages Lewis endorses
one species of what has come to be called Four Dimensionalism. The
expression &lsquo;Four Dimensionalism&rsquo; has been applied to a
number of different positions that it is well to distinguish here,
since not all of them are relevant to identity across time.
&lsquo;Four Dimensionalism&rsquo; has sometimes been used for the
thesis, particularly associated with Relativity Theory, that time is
space-like. On another use of &lsquo;Four Dimensionalism&rsquo; a
persisting thing is identical with its history. On this view an object
is a sequence of events. Sometimes &lsquo;Four Dimensionalism&rsquo;
is used to label the view that, contra Presentism, things past,
present, and future are equally real.</p>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo; version of Four Dimensionalism should be distinguished
from all of the above. It is the view that, just as an object such as
Plate is extended in space with spatial parts, so it is extended in
time with temporal parts. (See the entry on
 <a href="../temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The problem of temporary intrinsics focuses on the possibility of
persisting things changing their properties, or, at least, changing
their intrinsic properties. Many of the problems about identity
through time are posed by puzzle cases that involve change of parts.
Four dimensionalism is one, widely accepted, solution to those
puzzles. It is not overstretching it to suggest that each of the
puzzle cases we will shortly consider appears to be a case of
temporary identity. That is, each one appears to be a case of the
following. For some \(x\) and \(y\), at some time \(t x\) is identical
with \(y\), and at some time \(t'\), \(x\) is distinct from \(y\).</p>

<p>
In the first section we briefly looked at one argument, the so-called
modal argument for the necessity of identities, for denying that there
could be temporary identities. Some philosophers have responded to
some of the diachronic identity puzzles by maintaining that there
could be indeterminate identities. An argument with a similar
structure to the modal argument has been deployed to rule out
indeterminate identities. Given their implications for identity across
time, the modal argument and the argument against indeterminate
identities are set out in more detail in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="NecDetIde">3. Necessary and Determinate Identities</h2>

<p>
Here are two examples of identity statements:</p>

<p class="indent">
(i) The table in the next room is (now) identical with my favorite
table.</p>

<p class="indent">
(ii) The table in the next room is identical with the one you
purchased last year.</p>

<p>
(i) and (ii) are contingent. Even if the table in the next room is my
favorite table, it might not have been. Even if the table in the next
room is the one you purchased last year, it might not have been. One
of the most important discussions of identity is to be found in Saul
Kripke&rsquo;s paper &lsquo;Identity and Necessity&rsquo; and his book
<em>Naming and Necessity</em> (in Munitz 1971, Kripke 1980). One
lesson to be learned from Kripke&rsquo;s discussion is that it is
illegitimate to infer from identity statements such as (i) and (ii)
having their truth value contingently that the relation of identity
can hold contingently.</p>

<p>
Why is this inference illegitimate? Compare (i) with:</p>

<p class="indent">
(iii) The table in the next room is the same size as my favorite
table.</p>

<p>
Being the same size as is an equivalence relation (i.e., it is
symmetric, reflexive, and transitive) that holds contingently. What
does it take for that relation to hold contingently between the table
in the next room and my favorite table? Thinking in terms of possible
worlds, the table in the next room is contingently the same size as my
favorite table just in case the following is so. The table in the next
room is the same size as my favorite table, but, in some possible
world \(W\), something identical to (or a counterpart of) the actual
table in the next room is not the same size as what is actually my
favorite table.</p>

<p>
Without having recourse to possible worlds, what this comes to is that
the table in the next room is contingently the same size as my
favorite table only if, in addition to (iii), the following is
true:</p>

<p class="indent">
(iv) \((\exists x)(\exists y)[(x =\) the table in the next room) &amp;
\((y =\) my favorite table) &amp; (possibly, \(x\) is not the same
size as \(y)]\).</p>

<p>
Likewise the table in the next room is contingently identical with my
favorite table only if, in some world \(W\), what is actually my
favorite table is not identical with what is actually the table in the
next room. That condition need not be satisfied for (i) to be
contingently true. All it takes for (i) to be contingently true is
that, for example, (i) is true, but in some world \(W\) something
qualifies as my favorite table without also qualifying as the table in
the next room. For that to be so nothing need be identical, or
counterpart related, across worlds.</p>

<p>
Kripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offer an argument to show that there are
no contingent identities. Here is one version of that argument often
referred to as the Modal Argument for the Necessity of Identities:</p>

<p>
Suppose:</p> 
\[\tag{1}
a=b
\]

<p>
But each thing is necessarily identical with itself. Hence;</p>

\[\tag{2}
\Box(a=a)
\]

<p>
Taking &lsquo;\([\lambda x\ \Phi]\)&rsquo; to mean: being an \(x\)
such that \(\Phi\) (where \(\Phi\) is some logical formula in which
&lsquo;\(x\)&rsquo; is a free variable), we supposedly have:</p>

\[\tag{3}
[\lambda x\ \Box(x=a)]a
\]

<p>
Since, by Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, if (1) then \(a\) and \(b\) share all
properties in common. Hence (1) and (3) yield:</p> 
\[\tag{4}
[\lambda x\ \Box(x=a)]b
\]

<p>
which in turn yields:</p> 
\[\tag{5}
\Box(a=b).
\]

<p>
Though widely accepted, this type of argument has been contested.
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, again understood as ranging over identity
properties, is used to derive step (4)&mdash;\(b\) has the property of
being necessarily identical with \(a\)&mdash;from step (3), \(a\) has
the property of being necessarily identical with \(a\). One might deny
that there are any such modal properties. Doing so blocks the argument
if the application of LL is restricted to properties. Alternatively,
one might allow that there are such properties as being necessarily
identical with \(a\), but deny that (3) follows from (2). On one view,
all that follows from (2) is that \(a\) has the property of being
necessarily identical with itself expressed by the predicate
&lsquo;\([\lambda x\ x=x]\)&rsquo;. We need to distinguish the
property of being necessarily identical with itself, which every
existent has, from the property of being necessarily identical with
\(a\)&mdash;which only \(a\) has (Lowe 1982).</p>

<p>
Finally, (2) has been rejected on the following grounds. There is a
well entrenched convention that repeated tokens of the same type of
name, constant or variable are assigned the same value. From the
existence of this convention it follows that &lsquo;\(a = a\)&rsquo;
expresses a truth. It does not follow, according to this objection,
that &lsquo;\(a = a\)&rsquo; expresses something necessarily true.
Here is the thought. Suppose, the repeated use of a proper name were
governed, not by the identity convention, but by what we may call the
admiration convention. According to the admiration convention, a
subsequent occurrence of a proper name in a sentence should be taken
to refer to something only if it is admired by the referent of the
first occurrence. In the light of this, admittedly bizarre, convention
consider the truth value of &lsquo;Napoleon admires Napoleon&rsquo;.
If the second occurrence of &lsquo;Napoleon&rsquo; refers, it will
refer to someone admired by the referent of the first occurrence. So,
if the admiration convention is adhered to, &lsquo;Napoleon admires
Napoleon&rsquo; will, if it expresses any proposition, express a true
one. This is guaranteed by our supposition that the relation governing
the repeated use of &lsquo;\(a\)&rsquo; is the same as the one that
\(a\) is said to stand in to \(a\). Despite that, &lsquo;Napoleon
admires Napoleon&rsquo; expresses a contingent truth. Likewise,
&lsquo;\(a=a\)&rsquo; expresses a true proposition if it expresses any
proposition at all, since the relation governing the repeated use of
&lsquo;\(a\)&rsquo; is the same as the one that \(a\) is said to stand
in to \(a\). But, as with &lsquo;Napoleon admires Napoleon&rsquo;
given the admiration convention, there is no reason to suppose that
the truth expressed by &lsquo;\(a=a\)&rsquo; is a necessary one.
(Gallois 1998, 229&ndash;231). This objection is not unassailable,
however. First, it is not obvious how the same objection can be made
in terms of the sentence &lsquo;\(a\) is identical with itself&rsquo;
or a sentence in quantified first order logic, such as \((\exists
x)(Fx \text{ and } Gx)\). In the latter case, the identity convention
seems essential to the meaning of the recurrent variable (Hawthorne
2003, 100). Second, it should be granted that the fact that a sentence
expresses a true proposition if it expresses anything is not by itself
sufficient for the proposition that it expresses being a necessary
truth. However, granting this does not compromise premise (2), which
is the <em>proposition</em> that \(a=a\) is necessarily true, which is
independent of the conventions used in expressing that
proposition.</p>

<p>
Philosophers have appealed to contingent identities to solve identity
puzzles. They have also appealed to vague or indeterminate identities
to solve such puzzles. Consider a club that over an extended time
changes its rules, membership and location. Is the original club
identical with the club having a new location, rules and membership?
Call the original club the Identity Club, and the club with new rules,
membership and location the Constitution Club. Is the following
true?:</p>

<p class="indent">
C: The Identity Club = The Constitution Club.</p>

<p>
Some would say that that the identity stated by \(C\) is vague or
indeterminate. What does it mean to say that an identity is vague or
indeterminate? At least this. \(C\) is not determinately true, or
determinately false. If \(C\) does lack a determinate truth value, is
that enough to ensure that the identity of the clubs referred to by
\(C\) is indeterminate?</p>

<p>
In the case of the identity sentence:</p>

<p class="indent">
(i) The table in the next room is (now) identical with my favorite
table.</p>

<p>
we saw the need to distinguish between (i) having its truth value
contingently, and (i) stating an identity that holds only
contingently. We likewise need to distinguish \(C\) having an
indeterminate truth value from \(C\) stating an identity that holds
only indeterminately. \(C\) may lack a determinate truth value because
one, or both, of the referring expressions &lsquo;The Identity
Club&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Constitution Club&rsquo; lacks a
determinate referent. Nevertheless for any determinate choice of
referents for those expressions \(C\) has a determinate truth
value.</p>

<p>
Can it happen that the referring expressions &lsquo;\(a\)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;\(b\)&rsquo; refer precisely in the identity sentence
&lsquo;\(a=b\)&rsquo; without that sentence being determinately true
or false? Here is one version of an argument, due to Gareth Evans and
Nathan Salmon, that is supposed to show that it cannot (Evans 1978,
Salmon 1981). Let &lsquo;\(Ip\)&rsquo; mean: it is indeterminate
whether \(p\), that is \(p\) is neither determinately true nor
determinately false, and let &lsquo;\(Dp\)&rsquo; mean: it is
determinate that \(p\). We have:</p> 
\[\tag{$1'$}
I(a=b).
\]

<p>
But:</p> 
\[\tag{$2'$}
D (a=a).
\]

<p>
This \((2')\) yields:</p> 
\[\tag{$3'$}
[\lambda x\ D(x=a)]a
\]

<p> which states: \(a\) has the property of it being determinate that
it is identical with \(a\). Suppose:</p>

\[\tag{$4'$}
a=b
\]

<p>
Applying Leibniz&rsquo;s Law to \((3')\) and \((4')\) gives:</p>

\[\tag{$5'$}
[\lambda x\ D(a=x)]b
\]

<p>
which states: \(b\) has the property of it being determinate that it
is identical with \(a\). From the above, it follows that:</p>

\[\tag{$6'$}
D(a=b),
\]

<p>
which contradicts \((1')\). Hence \((1')\) implies:</p> 
\[\tag{$7'$}
\neg(a=b)
\]

<p>
If \((7')\) is true then it is not true that \(a\) is identical with
\(b\). So if \((7')\) is true, \(a\) is determinately distinct from
\(b. (1')\) cannot be true.</p>

<p>
Of course, defenders of indeterminate identity do not let this pass
unquestioned. One assumption of the argument is that \((7')\) implies
that \(a\) is determinately distinct from \(b\) rather than just that
\(a\) is not determinately identical with \(b\).</p>

<p>
Arguments against contingent and indeterminate identities appeal to
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Seen as a principle about the transmission of
properties across identity, Leibniz&rsquo;s Law or its use in
metaphysics has been scrutinized (see Schnieder 2006, Magidor 2011,
Shumener 2022). Similarly, Evans&rsquo; argument has been called into
question from a number of directions. Examples include Parsons 2000
(esp. Appendix), and more recently Barnes 2009; also see entry on

<h2 id="DiaIdePuz">4. Diachronic Identity Puzzles</h2>

<p>
In the introduction we encountered one type of puzzle about identity
across time: the case of Cup and Tcup. The puzzle arose because we
envisaged Cup losing one of its parts, and coming to have the same
material constitution (being, for example, composed of exactly the
same atoms as), and spatial boundaries as Tcup. Call this the cup
case. Let us say that \(a\) and \(b\) are coincident at a time \(t\)
just in case the following holds. Something is a proper part of \(a\)
at \(t\) if and only if it is a proper part of \(b\) at that same
time. Cup and Tcup are coincident at the later time since something at
that later time is, for example, and atomic part of \(a\) if and only
if it is an atomic part of \(b\).</p>

<p>
Such a case is not the only, or even main, type of case posing a
problem about diachronic identity. In addition, there are what are
often referred to as fission and fusion cases. A fission case has the
following features. We have putatively distinct things \(b\) and \(c\)
existing at some later time \(t_2\). Each of \(b\) and \(c\) is
related to \(a\), which exists at an earlier time \(t_1\), in such a
way that each one is ostensibly identical with \(a\).</p>

<p>
Fission cases come in two varieties: symmetrical and asymmetrical.
Examples of symmetrical fission cases include amoebic and hemispheric
division [for the latter see Personal Identity below]. In a
symmetrical case there is some relation that each of \(b\) and \(c\)
stand in to \(a\), where standing in that relation is what makes each
one putatively identical with \(a\). In an asymmetric case, \(b\) is
putatively identical with \(a\) because it stands in a certain
relation to \(a\), but \(c\) is putatively identical with \(a\)
because it stands in a different relation to \(a\).</p>

<p>
The best known example of an asymmetrical fission case is the Ship of
Theseus. Over a long period all of the planks composing a certain ship
are replaced one by one. Eventually a ship indiscernible from the
original, but composed of entirely different planks, results. Call
that later ship Replacement. As each plank is removed from the
original ship it is used to construct a ship that is constituted from
all and only the planks belonging to the original ship. Call the ship
composed of the same planks as the ones initially composing the
original ship Reassembly.</p>

<p>
Identity is, very plausibly, an equivalence relation (see
 <a href="#IdeEquRel">Section 2.2</a>).
 One consequence of it being an equivalence relation is that it is
subject to transitivity: the principle that if <em>aRb</em> and
<em>bRc</em>, then <em>aRc</em>. Saying that, in the case of
Theseus&rsquo; ship, Replacement and Reassembly are both identical
with the original ship putatively conflicts with the transitivity of
identity since Replacement seems to be later clearly distinct from
Reassembly.</p>

<p>
There are cases that pose similar diachronic identity puzzles that do
not involve change of parts. One of the best known involves a lump of
clay which, at an earlier time, is coincident with a statue, but, at a
later, say as a result of deformation, is just a shapeless lump of
clay. Since the lump has the property of existing at the later time
which the statue doesn&rsquo;t, given Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, the statue
and the lump must be distinct objects. One problem with this is that
during the time the statue exists, it would be against common sense to
say that they are two and not one.</p>

<p>
What is the best account of these cases? Here are some of the major
ones on offer:</p>

<h3 id="Con">4.1 Constitution</h3>

<p>
Constitution accounts pivot on the distinction between constitution
and identity. Defenders of such accounts hold that constitution,
unlike identity, is not an equivalence relation (Baker 2002).
Constitution is said to be, at least, non-symmetrical. According to a
constitution account, we say the following about the three types of
puzzle cases described above. Cup is never identical with Tcup. Later
Cup is constituted by Tcup. (Alternatively: Cup and Tcup never
constitute each other, but later are constituted from the very same
atoms.) Likewise the lump of clay is never identical with the statue,
but earlier only constitutes the statue. Finally, the reassembly ship
is never identical, but only constituted from exactly the same planks
as, the original.</p>

<p>
A constitution theorist can say the following about Theseus&rsquo;
Ship. The ship resulting from the replacement of the original planks
is identical with, but not constituted from, the original planks. The
ship reconstituted from the original planks is not identical with the
one originally constituted from those planks. Unfortunately,
constitution only delivers a candidate solution in a symmetric fission
case.</p>

<p>
Kit Fine has deployed a number of novel Leibniz&rsquo;s Law arguments
in favour of a constitution account. Such arguments are replied to by
Brian Frances in Frances 2006.</p>

<p>
The constitution view has come in for its share of criticisms. Some
think it engages in metaphysical multiple vision, seeing a
multiplicity of things at a given place and time where there is
plausibly only one. Others argue that constitution \(is\) identity
(see Noonan 1993).</p>

<p>
A number of objections have been raised against constitution views.
One is an objection from causal overdetermination. Another is an
objection from grounding. Consider a statue allegedly constituted from
a statue shaped piece of clay. Someone throws the statue against a
pane of glass, which breaks. What caused the glass to break? Surely,
the statue impacting it. But the glass was also impacted by the statue
shaped piece of clay with sufficient force to break it. So, if
constitution is not identity, the glass breaking has two causes. Some
would say that is one cause too many.</p>

<p>
The objection from grounding is not so much an objection to the
constitution view, but an objection designed to undermine a principal
reason for adopting it. A principal reason for adopting the
constitution view is that it seems to allow, for example, the statue
and the piece of clay to have different properties. In particular, it
seems to allow them to have different modal properties such as being
squashable. Since constitution, unlike identity, does not conform to
the indiscernibility of identicals, the clay can be squashable even if
the statue is not.</p>

<p>
The problem is that the clay and the statue are made up of exactly the
same atoms organized in the same way. Since that is so, it is hard to
see how the clay can be squashable without the statue being so as
well. Catherine Sutton argues that the clay and the statue differ in
their extrinsic properties, specifically in their relationship to
human intentions (Sutton 2012).</p>

<p>
A further problem for constitution views is the so called too many
minds objection (see Olsen 1997 and Shoemaker 1999). Advocates of
constitutionalism typically hold that a person is constituted by a
living organism. If so, the person and the living organism
constituting that person share the same thoughts. Whenever you
encounter a person you encounter a distinct living organism having
occupying the same region and having the same thoughts. Not a good
result.</p>

<h3 id="RelIde">4.2 Relative Identity</h3>

<p>
Advocates of relative identity deny that there is a single identity
relation (see Geach 1967, Griffin 1977). On their view it is improper
to ask whether, say, the statue is the same thing as the later lump of
clay. Instead we should ask whether it is the same statue, or the same
lump of clay. For an advocate of relative identity denying that the
earlier statue is the same statue as the later lump of clay is
consistent with allowing that the earlier statue is the same lump of
clay as the later lump of clay. It is natural for the relative
identity theorist to insist on relativising the transitivity of
identity to the same sortal concept in the following way. What the
relativised transitivity principle says is that: \(a\) is the same
\(F\) as \(b\), and \(b\) is the same \(F\) as \(c\) implies only that
\(a\) is the same \(F\) as \(c\) (see Griffin 1977).</p>

<p>
One objection to relative identity is that it conflicts with
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. Here is one way in which such conflict may be
thought to arise. Consider the property version of Leibniz&rsquo;s
Law:</p> 
\[\tag{LL}
\forall x\forall y[x=y \rightarrow \forall F(Fx \rightarrow Fy)]
\]

<p>
The relation of identity mentioned in the antecedent of LL is
unrelativised to a sortal. To make it acceptable to the relative
identity theorist, let us amend LL to:</p> 
\[\tag{LLR}
\forall x\forall y[\forall F(x \text{ is the same } F \text{ as } y) \rightarrow
\forall G(Gx \rightarrow Gy)]
\]

<p>
Suppose we replace &lsquo;is the same \(F\) as \(y\)&rsquo; in LLR
with &lsquo;is the same lump of clay&rsquo;, &lsquo;\(x\)&rsquo; with
&lsquo;the earlier statue&rsquo;, &lsquo;\(y\)&rsquo; with &lsquo;the
later clay lump&rsquo;, and instantiate the quantifier \(\forall G\)
with &lsquo;is the same statue as the earlier statue&rsquo;. We then
obtain:</p>

<p class="indent">
R: the earlier statue is the same lump of clay as the later clay lump
\(\rightarrow\) (the earlier statue is the same statue as the earlier
statue \(\rightarrow\) the earlier statue is the same statue as the
later clay lump ).</p>

<p>
The trouble is that \(R\) is false. The earlier statue is the same
lump of clay as the clay lump, and the earlier statue is the same
statue as the earlier statue, but the earlier statue is not, contrary
to LLR, the same statue as the later clay lump.</p>

<p>
Some relative identity theorists have this to say about Theseus&rsquo;
Ship. In that case conflict with the transitivity of identity is
avoided by maintaining the following. The replacement ship is the same
ship as the original, and the original is the same collection of
planks as the reassembly ship. Conflict with transitivity is avoided
because we need not allow that the reassembly ship is the same ship as
the original.</p>

<p>
In symmetrical fission cases, however, relative identity theory is not
helpful. If an amoeba, call it \(A\), fissions into amoebae \(B\) and
\(C\), each of \(B\) and \(C\) have a claim to being the same amoeaba
as \(A\). Since \(B\) and \(C\) are not the same amoeba, transitivity
fails.</p>

<h3 id="IdeStrLoo">4.3 Identity: &lsquo;Strict&rsquo; and &lsquo;Loose&rsquo;</h3>

<p>
Following Bishop Butler, Roderick Chisholm distinguishes between a
strict and a loose sense of identity (see Chisholm 1969a and 1976;
Steen 2008 for a meticulous study of the evolution of Chisholm&rsquo;s
ontological views). To see what this distinction comes to, and how it
might help with the puzzle cases, consider the case of Cup and Tcup.
For Chisholm things have their parts essentially in the following
sense. It is impossible for \(a\) to be identical with \(b\) in the
strict and philosophical sense, unless \(a\) and \(b\) have all their
parts in common. Earlier Cup has a part, a handle, that later Cup, not
to mention earlier and later Tcup, lacks. Hence, on Chisholm&rsquo;s
view, earlier Cup is not strictly identical with later Cup.</p>

<p>
Earlier Cup is nonetheless identical with later Cup in a loose and
popular sense. What then, according to Chisholm, is it for earlier Cup
and later Cup to be identical in a loose and popular sense? To
simplify let us suppose, unrealistically, that the only change of
parts that Cup in, Chisholm would say, a loose and popular sense
undergoes is loss of a handle. Call Hcup the object that consists of
Cup&rsquo;s handle together with Tcup. Chisholm would say this.
Earlier, Hcup stands in for Cup, and later Tcup alone stands in for
Cup. Moreover Tcup is related to Hcup in such a way that, as Chisholm
puts it, Tcup at \(t_2\) is the <em>ens successivum</em> of Hcup at an
earlier time \(t_1 .\) For Chisholm what makes Tcup at \(t_2\) an
<em>ens successivum</em> of Hcup at \(t_1\) seems to be this. Tcup is
a proper part of Hcup at \(t_1\). There is a sequence \(S\) of cups
such that each member of \(S\) that is not identical with Hcup is, at
some time, a proper part of some member of \(S\). For each time
between and including \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) Cup some member of \(S\)
stands in for cup. Since Hcup stands in for Cup \(t_1\) and Tcup
stands in for Cup at \(t_2\) and Tcup is an <em>ens successivum</em>
of Hcup, we may say that earlier cup is loosely identical with later
Cup.</p>

<p>
According to Chisholm, the puzzles we have encountered stem from our
conflating strict with loose and popular identity. In the case of Ship
of Theseus, we find it intuitive to say that Replacement is the same
as the original ship because we have in mind loose and popular
identity. We also find Reassembly to be a good fit to be identical to
the original since they share all the same parts and so pass the
demands of strict identity. The Ship of Theseus characterized as entia
successiva is not real but a logical construction, in a succession of
materials that go from the original to Replacement. The set of planks
that stood in for the ship before replacements began are the same set
of planks that make up Reassembly. Whether strict identity obtains
between the original ship and Reassembly is a thorny issue that
depends on whether a mass of matter can continue to exist when its
parts are not located together or else whether something can go out of
existence and come back into existence. Chisholm&rsquo;s views on this
have shifted over the years. (Mark Steen in Steen 2008 offers an
excellent exposition of the evolution of Chisholm&rsquo;s views on
identity over time.) Whatever Chisholm says about the putative
identity of the original planks and Reassembly, however, it is clear
how according to his view, transitivity of identity is not violated,
since Replacement is not strictly identical with the original
ship.</p>

<p>
The two functional ships, as ordinary objects, must be distinct series
of entia successiva. What can Chisholm say about one ordinary
object&rsquo;s fission into two? Chisholm would say that ordinary
objects characterized as entia successiva are not real but logical
constructions. As logical constructions it might be considered
unproblematic for two ships to be at the same place at the same time
in the beginning of the scenario.</p>

<p>
It is not easy to see how Chisholm would answer the question of what
it takes to be entia successiva at all. His characterization of them
requires appeal to ordinary object or natural kind sortals, but since
entia successiva are logical constructs rather than real objects, it
is hard to know why there could not be plenty of other kinds of entia
successiva that answer to sortals that are not in any known conceptual
framework.</p>

<p>
The puzzle cases are puzzle cases because they bring into putative
conflict intuitions all of which we want to subscribe to. Consider a
statue and the collection of atoms that constitute it. We wish to say
that the statue is identical with the collection of atoms. We also
wish to say that the statue, but not the collection, can survive the
loss of one atom belonging to that collection. Leibniz&rsquo;s Law
appears to force us to renounce one of these intuitions. We have seen
how Chisholm tries to reconcile these two intuitions. More recently
Thomas Sattig argues for a similar compatibilist view according to
which we can hold on to both intuitions without giving up, or
modifying, Leibniz&rsquo;s Law. We can do so by relativizing
identities to different perspectives. From the ordinary object
perspective the statue is distinct from the atoms that constitute it.
From the material object perspective the statue is identical with the
atoms that constitute it. Material object is Sattig&rsquo;s term for a
mereological sums of atoms, which obey unrestricted composition
mentioned in section \(X\) as well as another principle known as
extensionality. According to extensionality a given set of objects can
have only one sum. Ordinary objects are more than just material
objects. They are composed of material objects as well a formal
element Sattig calls a K-path. Thus, to use a term we saw in the
opening, Sattig&rsquo;s view is somewhat hylomorphist. By combining
the resources of hylomorphism with the advantages of a perspectivalist
analysis of the claims we find intuitive Sattig offers complex
solutions to each of the puzzles we have been working on (Sattig 2015,
Chapter 4).</p>

<h3 id="ArbUndPar">4.4 Arbitrary Undetached Parts</h3>

<p>
One solution to the problem posed by the cup case is to reject what
Peter van Inwagen calls the Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts
(see van Inwagen 1981). In setting the problem up we assumed that
earlier Cup consists of the following parts: a handle together with
Tcup. That assumption is justified if the following is. Tcup existed
as a part of Cup when Cup still had its handle. Van Inwagen would
reject that assumption. According to him it is illegitimate to assume
that any old way of notionally dividing up an object yields an
individual that exists as an undetached part.</p>

<p>
Instead of denying that Tcup exists at \(t_1\) when it is ostensibly a
proper part of Cup, we might instead deny that Tcup at \(t_1\) is
identical with what looks very much like Tcup at \(t_2\). In this way
we can preserve transitivity without having to identify the earlier
cup with one of its proper parts.</p>

<p>
One way to allow that Tcup earlier exists without conceding its later
identity with Cup is, following Michael Burke, to maintain that Tcup
goes out of existence when Cup loses its handle (see Burke 1994).
Roughly, this is because at that instant the matter that made Tcup
before stops being a part of a cup and starts being a cup (see the
Dominant Kinds section of the entry on
 <a href="../material-constitution/">material constitution</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="FouDim">4.5 Four Dimensionalism</h3>

<p>
Here is what a classical four dimensionalist would say about the case
of the cup. Suppose the interval from \(t_1\) to \(t_2\) is the time
during which Cup has a handle attached to it, and \(t_2\) to \(t_3\)
the interval during which Cup is without a handle, and, so, putatively
identical with Tcup. As before Hcup is the fusion of Tcup and
Cup&rsquo;s handle. According to the four dimensionalist, Cup, Tcup
and Hcup are all extended in time as well as space. Tcup has a
temporal part that extends from \(t_1\) to \(t_2\) together with a
temporal part that extends from \(t_2\) to \(t_3\). Tcup&rsquo;s
\(t_1\) to \(t_2\) and \(t_2\) to \(t_3\) temporal parts are distinct
from each other as well as being distinct from the temporally longer
Tcup. Hcup, that is Tcup plus handle, is a four dimensional object
that extends from \(t_1\) to \(t_2\). Cup itself consists of the
following two, among indefinitely many other, temporal parts: Hcup and
the \(t_2\) to \(t_3\) part of Tcup.</p>

<p>
What we should say according to the classical four dimensionalist is
this. The \(t_1\) to \(t_2\) temporal part of Tcup is a proper
temporal and spatial part of Hcup. Hcup and the \(t_2\) to \(t_3\)
temporal parts of Tcup are proper temporal parts of Cup. Cup is not
identical with any of Hcup, Tcup from \(t_1\) to \(t_2\), Tcup from
\(t_2\) to \(t_3\), or Tcup from \(t_1\) to \(t_3\). In particular
there is no question of Cup being literally identical with Tcup from
\(t_2\) to \(t_3\), when they are indiscernible, though, following
David Lewis, we may say that Cup and Tcup are identical at any time
between \(t_2\) and \(t_3\) in the sense that they share temporal
parts during those times (see Lewis 1986).</p>

<p>
Many four-dimensionalists subscribe to a principle that a number of
writers call unrestricted mereological composition. According to that
principle any set of, in this case four-dimensional, objects
constitute a further four dimensional object. Armed with the
unrestricted mereological composition principle a four-dimensionalist
can say that what there is, in the case of Theseus&rsquo; ship, is a
\(Y\) branching object dividable in an indefinite number of ways into
four dimensional proper parts an indefinite number of which are ships.
For example the ship consisting of the stem together with the
replacement branch has as two of its proper parts a ship consisting of
just the stem, and one consisting of just the replacement branch
(Heller 1984, 1990, 2000, Lewis 1986.)</p>

<p>
Apart from the argument that it provides the best solution to
diachronic identity puzzles four dimensionalism has been defended on a
number of other grounds. One we have reviewed already; the argument
that four dimensionalism gives the best solution to the problem of
temporary intrinsics. Another, also offered by David Lewis, invokes
the principle that facts in general supervene on facts about the
instantiations of intrinsic properties and external relations. Call
facts about the instantiation of intrinsic properties and external
relations basic facts, and let \(R\) be the spatio-temporal region
occupied by Plate throughout its career. According to Lewis there is a
world \(W\) in which a sequence of shorter Plate-like objects occupy
\(R\), and all of the basic facts that obtain in our world obtain in
\(W\). Lewis&rsquo; supervenience principle tells us that all facts
supervene on basic facts. The same basic facts obtain in both our
world and \(W\). So whatever is true of the occupant of \(R\) in \(W\)
is true of the occupant of \(R\) in our world. The occupant of \(R\)
in \(W\) is a sequence of, appropriately interrelated Plate-like
objects. Hence the occupant of \(R\) in our world, that is Plate, is
likewise a sequence of interrelated Plate-like objects.</p>

<p>
Recently Sider (2002) developed an argument for Four Dimensionalism
from considerations about vagueness. He argues that Four
Dimensionalism is true if it cannot be vague how many things there
are, and also that it cannot be vague how many things there are.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that Sider and Katherine Hawley defend an
alternative version of four dimensionalism which identifies objects
with what, on the first version, would qualify as their stages (Hawley
2001, Sider 2002). In order to make this identification Sider invokes
something close to Lewis&rsquo; counterpart relation. Will the table I
am currently looking at persist through the next ten minutes?
According to the classical four-dimensionalist, otherwise known as the
perdurantist, the table will persist through that period provided it
has a present and a ten minutes from now table stage that are both
stages of the table without either one being identical with the table.
In contrast the stage theorist says that in our table talk we refer to
stages, not four dimensional objects. So how can we say that the table
I am looking at will still be here ten minutes from now? The stage
theorist says that we can, because, though the ten minute from now
table stage is not now what we mean when we talk about the table, it
is what we will be referring to ten minutes from now, since it stands
in the appropriate counterpart relation to the present table stage.
Whereas Sider defends the stage view as an additional points about the
meanings of our ordinary object language, Hawley considers it the
correct ontology of what ordinary objects are. Sometimes
Hawley&rsquo;s view is called exdurantism.</p>

<p>
Stage theory enjoys the following advantage over classical four
dimensionalism. Consider the case of a person fissioning into two
later people. A classical four-dimensionalist like Lewis will say that
before the fission there are two separate people that cannot be told
apart. The stage theorist has no need to say that. Instead the stage
theorist can say there is a single present person who will be
identical with each of a pair of later individuals in virtue of
standing in the relevant counterpart relations to each one.</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that four dimensionalism differs from
Chisholm&rsquo;s invocation of loose and popular identity in, at
least, the following way. The persistence of an object for any length
of time will, on a four dimensionalist view, require the existence of
shorter lived objects setting aside the possibility of extended
simples. The persistence for any length of time, on Chisholm&rsquo;s
view, of a three dimensional object does not require the existence of
shorter lived three dimensional objects. It does not do so because the
object persisting for a lengthy period may undergo no change of
parts.</p>

<p>
Classical four dimensionalism can address the statue and lump puzzle
as follows. The statue and the lump are distinct four dimensional
objects, and it is easy to understand this as one has (temporal) parts
the other lacks. This view has the advantage of vindicating the
intuitive idea that at any given moment, there can only be one thing
in any place (Hawley 2008, Eddon 2010). This is because at any given
moment a single object is both a stage of the statue and a stage of
the lump. This advantage disappears for versions of this puzzle where
the lump and and the statue come into existence at exactly the same
time and are destroyed simultaneously. In such a case, what can
explain what distinguishes the four dimensional statue from the four
dimensional lump? Four dimensionalists like Lewis and Sider have
appealed to counterpart theory of modality to answer this question.
They would say that a single four-dimensional object has at least two
distinct sets of counterparts, its statue counterparts and its lump of
clay counterparts. For example, there are possible worlds where a
counterpart of the lump of clay gets squashed but continues to exist.
(For more on counterparts, see entry on
 <a href="../possible-worlds/">possible worlds</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
One reason to oppose four dimensionalism, inspired by an argument by
Frank Jackson in Jackson 1999, is as follows. Four dimensionalism asks
us to accept, on purely metaphysical grounds, that the matter in the
universe constantly gets refreshed at each moment. Here is why. Since,
according to four dimensionalism, no instantaneous stage is
numerically identical to any other instantaneous stage that came
before it, the entire universe is constantly losing and acquiring
stages. The problem is, whether this is the case is an empirical fact
that can only be ascertained through <em>a posteriori</em> means. A
metaphysics of identity over time should analyze what it is to be
numerically identical through time while remaining neutral about
whether any piece of matter at one time is numerically the same as a
piece of matter in any other time. Here is another way to make this
point. If a school of physicists put forth a flickering universe
hypothesis, and another school of physicists rejected it, a
metaphysics of identity over time that is consistent with both schools
would be preferable over a metaphysics on which the flickering
universe hypothesis is trivially true. Four dimensionalism is the
latter. (For more discussion of four dimensionalism, see the entry on
 <a href="../temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="TemIde">4.6 Temporary Identity</h3>

<p>
In the case of, for example, the truncated cup we saw that one option
is to claim that Cup is earlier distinct from Tcup [cup minus its
handle], but later identical with Tcup. According to this option, the
identity of Cup with Tcup is only temporary. We also saw that many
refuse to countenance temporary identity because it allegedly
conflicts with Leibniz&rsquo;s Law [LL]. After all, Cup, but not Tcup,
apparently later has the property of having had a handle.</p>

<p>
Despite this putative conflict with LL, some philosophers are prepared
to defend temporary identity as the best solution to the puzzles about
diachronic identity. George Myro does so by restricting the scope of
LL to exclude such properties as having had a handle (Myro 1985).
Gallois (1998) does so by arguing that if the identity of Cup and Tcup
is temporary, we cannot infer from Tcup having had a handle earlier
that earlier Tcup has a handle.</p>

<p>
In the Ship of Theseus case, a temporary identity theorist will hold
that Replacement and Reassembly are identical at \(t_1\), but distinct
ships at \(t_2\). This does not contradict the transitivity of
identity, which, they accept in the following, modified, sense as the
Transitivity of Temporary Identity (Gallois 1998, 70):</p>

\[\tag{TTI}
\forall x\forall y\forall z[(\text{At } t:
x=y \amp \text{ At } t: y=z) \rightarrow \text{ At } t:
x=z].
\]

<p>
According to the temporary identity theory, temporary identity is
identity. Because of this, it should be a transitive relation. Ralf
Bader argues that the temporary identity relation fails even this
version of transitivity of identity. To see why, imagine two objects
\(B\) and \(D\), at \(t\). Later at \(t', B\) and \(D\) both undergo
fission. Simultaneously as the fissions, a product of \(B\)&rsquo;s
fission and a product of D&rsquo;s fission fuse. The outcome of these
simultaneous fusion and fissions is that, at \(t'\) there are three
objects: \(A, C\), and \(E. B\) has split into \(A\) and \(C, D\) has
split into \(C\) and \(E\). In this case, the following is true:</p>

\[
\text{At } t: A=C \amp \text{ At }t: C=E
\]

<p>
Given TTI, this would entail</p>

<p>

\[
\text{At } t: A=E.
\]

<p>
However, this is not the case (Bader 2010).</p>

<p>
Sider argues that Gallois&rsquo; view conflicts with B-theory of time
that is widely accepted among philosophers (Sider 2001).</p>

<h3 id="ModPle">4.7 Modal Plenitude</h3>

<p>
So far, we have been considering coincidence, or the existence of more
than one thing in the same place at the same time, as a cost. Many
philosophers hold that if there are in a single place at any given
time two distinct objects, such as the statue and the piece of clay,
Cup and Tcup, or Replacement and Reassembly, their being distinct or
being having different properties would need an explanation. Some
philosophers in favor of coincident objects argued that these sorts of
facts may be brute facts, that is to say, facts that do not have or
need any explanation (Wasserman 2002, Bennett 2004, Kurtsal 2010).</p>

<p>
One problem coincidence theories face is the following. If there can
be two things at the same place at the same time that differ only
modally, are there also three, more, or indefinitely many things that
differ only modally and are at the same place at the same time? This
would be an ontological inflation that is best avoided (Sosa 1998,
Noonan 1993.) Here is one way to see why the answer might be yes. Let
us say that there is an object \(o\) which has property \(F\)
essentially, and property \(G\) accidentally. Coinciding with \(o\) is
another object \(o'\) that has \(F\) and \(G\) essentially. When the
property \(F\) is no longer instantiated where these are, \(o\) goes
out of existence, leaving \(o'\). So far this schema matches the story
of the lump of clay and statue as well as the story of Cup and Tcup.
But now add this further twist that \(o\) and \(o'\) also had the
property \(H\), and accidentally so, but that there is an object
\(o^*\) that coincides with them and which has \(H\) essentially. When
\(H\) is lost by all three, this alters but does not destroy \(o\) and
\(o'\) but brings to an end \(o^*\)&rsquo;s existence. Let us call
\(o, o'\) and \(o^*\) modal variants of each other. Cases that match
this schema will tend to feel forced, but here is one example. Imagine
an old church building as the place of worship for a small
congregation who decides to sell their building. The new owner makes
some renovations but uses the building as their art studio. This means
that the place of worship does not exist anymore, but the church (with
its steeple, altar, stained glass windows) go on to exist. Finally the
artists also sells the building and the new owner restores the
building but removes the steeple, the windows and all the other
religious elements inside, thereby making the church to go out of
existence. The question is, is there a problem here? Some criticisms
of coincidence theory maintain that it would be objectionably
anthropocentric to claim that which kinds of objects there really are
in a place depends partly on which sortal concepts thinkers like us
happen to have (Hawthorne and Fairchild, 2018).</p>

<p>
In order to dispel this chauvinistic outcome, coincidence theorists
can embrace coincidence in an inflated way. What exactly would be the
problem with this? Penelope Mackie argues that such a view has no
disadvantage over four dimensionalist endorsements of objects that
permanently share temporal parts and differ only modally (Mackie
2008). Such a no restrictions approach is the view that is known as
Modal Plenitude. They can say that where ever there is one object,
there are indefinitely many more modal variants of it (Fairchild 2019,
2020). More generally, they can say that in every region of spacetime
every possible modal variant that can exist does exist (Kurtsal
2021).</p>

<p>
Just like the four dimensionalist Modal Plenitude theorist can say
that in every puzzle case the putative problems dissipate when we
point out that many objects are involved in the cases (Leslie 2011).
For many philosophers this solution is worse than the problem;
because, for them, without the resources of the four dimensionalism
the existence of indefinitely many things in the same place at the
same time is absurd. It should be noted, however, that Modal Plenitude
with coincidence is the only view that maintains the classical view of
identity without commitment to temporal parts, a splitting of reality
into different perspectives.</p>

<h3 id="Pha">4.8 Phasalism</h3>

<p>
In the introduction, we encountered the distinction between phase
sortals and substance sortals and noted that the puzzles we have will
be about objects as referred to with the help of substance sortals. A
little appreciated view offered by Michael Ayers (Ayers 1973),
defended by Marjorie Price (Price 1977) and more recently developed by
Justin Mooney (Mooney 2023, 2024a, 2024b, 2025) addresses puzzles
about identity over time by maintaining that there are no substance
sortals, only phase sortals. We do not ordinarily hold that anything
new comes into existence when someone becomes a teenager, or that
anything goes out of existence when a sapling becomes a tree. Mooney
would say we should understand the statue case in a similar way. That
is to say, nothing comes into existence when a statue is made from the
piece of clay, and similarly, nothing goes out of existence when it is
flattened. All that is happening is that something acquires the
property of being a statue and later loses this property and continues
to exist. All ordinary objects are phases of some other underlying
thing. Phasalism as a fully general ontology is criticized by Daniel
Korman in Korman (2015: 204&ndash;205) where he also names it, but
embraced as the correct solution to some of the puzzles in (2015:
155).</p>

<p>
Mooney holds that even lump of clay is a phase sortal. Then what is it
that acquires and loses the sortal properties now construed as phases?
Mooney tentatively holds that the underlying thing is a <em>thin
particular</em>, a logical construct postulated by metaphysicians as
that which has no properties of its own but is the bearer of the
properties of the object it underlies (see the entry on
 <a href="../substance/">substance</a>).
 A thin particular cannot go out of existence merely by ceasing to
instantiate one of its sortal properties. It can only go out by
ceasing to instantiate all of its sortal properties which happens in
cases such as decomposing (2023a: 235). This raises the question, if
there is such a particular \(x\) at time \(t\) and such a particular
\(y\) at \(t'\) what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for
it to be the case that \(x\) is identical with \(y\)? Mooney holds
that no answer to this question provides an explanatory criterion,
instead offering epistemic criteria (2025a).</p>

<p>
According to phasalism, in all the puzzle cases, what goes on involves
no creation or destruction but something undergoing, and surviving, a
change that is fundamentally not different from other, familiar kinds
of changes involving change of age, status, use, class, and so on. In
order to argue for this claim, Mooney adopts a pretheoretically
reasonable verdict about each type of case. For example, Mooney would
(in agreement with van Inwagen from section 4.4 above) say that Tcup
simply does not exist. Reassembly, Mooney holds, is not a candidate to
be identified with Theseus&rsquo; original ship; it is only a replica
(Mooney 2025b, 160&ndash;161).</p>

<p>
Korman has objected to phasalism by pointing out the following
problem. Suppose that a lump of clay is made into a lion statue. Later
it is flattened and made into an elephant statue. If, as the phasalist
holds, the lion statue is the lump of clay and the elephant statue is
the lump of clay, by transitivity it follows that the lion statue is
the elephant statue (Korman 2015, 206). Mooney&rsquo;s response is to
acknowledge the initial counterintuitiveness of this result while
pointing out its similarity to saying that a certain student is a
lifeguard and used to be a fast food worker (Mooney 2025b, 152).</p>
