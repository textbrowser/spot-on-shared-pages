<h1>Johannes Clauberg</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Oct 9, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Johannes Clauberg (1622&ndash;65) was a Reformed (Calvinist) professor
at the University of Duisburg. He was among Descartes&rsquo; earliest
advocates in Germany, whose apologetics, commentaries, and treatises
did much to introduce Protestant German audiences to Cartesian
philosophy. Clauberg won the admiration of the young Leibniz, who
judged him to be clearer than Descartes himself. Spinoza was familiar
with Clauberg through their mutual connection to the circle of
Lodewijk Meyer (1629&ndash;81). Clauberg was also known to the French
Cartesians, including Antoine Arnauld, Claude Clerselier,
G&eacute;raud de Cordemoy, Louis de la Forge, and Nicolas Malebranche.
Clauberg&rsquo;s influence is present in Christian Wolff
(1679&ndash;1754), who rated him as the best interpreter of
Descartes.</p>

<p>
In a brief but productive career, Clauberg wrote on all areas of
theoretical philosophy, including logic, language, metaphysics,
theology, physics, and the mind-body problem. He produced the first
comprehensive commentary on Descartes&rsquo;s <em>Meditations</em>,
and wrote lengthy responses to Descartes&rsquo;s early critics.
Clauberg was also an early proponent of the use of the German language
in academic philosophy, and a defender of <em>libertas
philosophandi</em> in the universities. Although he did not publish
any philosophical treatises in German, he began to lay the foundations
of a German philosophical vocabulary by inserting German glosses of
Latin phrases in his treatises. In the process of adapting
Cartesianism for use in the university curriculum, Clauberg made
significant contributions to the development of logic and metaphysics
in early modern Germany.</p>

<h2 id="LifWor">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Clauberg was born on 24 February 1622 in Solingen (now in North
Rhine-Westphalia) to Calvinist parents of middle-class backgrounds.
After spending two years at the gymnasium in Moers, he moved in 1639
to Bremen to complete his studies. The Bremen gymnasium enjoyed a
particularly strong reputation in Northern European Reformed circles
with an emphasis on classical and oriental languages, irenical
theology, and humanist philosophy. The professors of philosophy,
Balthasar Willius (1606&ndash;56) and G&eacute;rard de Neufville
(1590&ndash;1648), would leave a lasting mark on Clauberg, especially
with respect to their pupil&rsquo;s lifelong appreciation of Aristotle
and his profound interest in philosophy&rsquo;s educational function
(on de Neufville&rsquo;s influence, see Collacciani 2020). From
Bremen, Clauberg moved to the University of Groningen in 1644, which
had recently become the focus of Descartes&rsquo;s efforts to have his
works cleared of theological censure. It was during his two years at
Groningen that Clauberg probably encountered Descartes&rsquo;s
philosophy for the first time, no doubt under the tutelage of a fellow
Bremen alumnus, Tobias Andreae (1604&ndash;76), professor of History
and Greek and Descartes&rsquo;s main contact at the university. In
1646 Clauberg left to travel to France and England, including a year
spent at the Huguenot academy in Saumur. During his absence, Andreae
oversaw the publication of the first edition of Clauberg&rsquo;s
ontology, <em>Elementa philosophiae sive ontosophia</em> (1647), a
work Clauberg had written while still at the Bremen gymnasium (Verbeek
1999a).</p>

<p>
Clauberg returned to the Netherlands in early 1648, and quickly became
involved in the small but now established Dutch Cartesian circles. He
was present in Amsterdam on 20 April 1648, where he either copied or
helped to draft a report of Descartes&rsquo;s conversation in Egmond
four days earlier with Frans Burman, a theology student at Leiden. A
copy of Clauberg&rsquo;s manuscript of the &ldquo;Conversation with
Burman&rdquo; was discovered in 1895 in G&ouml;ttingen and published
by Charles Adam, which secured Clauberg&rsquo;s place in subsequent
Cartesian studies (see Arndt 1982 for details of the editions of this
text). After spending another year in Leiden attending lectures by
Johannes de Raey (1622&ndash;1702), Clauberg embarked on his own
professorial career, beginning in September 1649 at the famous
Calvinist academy in Herborn. His two years there were less than
satisfying, however, partly on account of the academy&rsquo;s declared
opposition to any approaches other than the Aristotelian and the
Ramist. Around Christmas 1651 Clauberg left Herborn for Duisburg,
initially to take up an appointment at the gymnasium, but within a few
years to become the first rector of the town&rsquo;s new university
(see Hamid 2020 for details of the university&rsquo;s founding).</p>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s fourteen years in Duisburg were prolific. During this
time he also became connected to the growing international network of
Cartesians. Clauberg&rsquo;s publication activity began with
<em>Defensio Cartesiana</em> (1652), a vigorous defense of Cartesian
method against the criticisms of the Leiden professor Jacobus Revius,
author of <em>Methodi Cartesianae consideratio theologica</em> (1648),
and his own former colleague at Herborn, Cyriacus Lentulus, author of
<em>Nova Renati Des Cartes sapientia</em> (1651). Among Revius&rsquo;s
objections to Cartesian philosophy was that its doctrines were
unsupported by a rigorous logical theory, since Descartes had openly
rejected Aristotelian syllogistic but had not, by Revius&rsquo;s
lights, supplied an alternative. Partly in response to this concern
about the completeness of Descartes&rsquo;s system, Clauberg next
published <em>Logica vetus et nova</em> (1654), which placed the
methodological precepts of the <em>Discourse on Method</em> at the
basis of a system of rules that could serve as an organon of science
(Strazzoni 2013). The <em>Logica</em> was followed by another
apologetic treatise, <em>Initiatio philosophi sive dubitatio
Cartesiana</em> (1655), which defended one of the key theological
obstacles to the acceptance of Descartes&rsquo;s philosophy, namely
the method of doubt. Clauberg&rsquo;s remaining works were mainly
systematic or exegetical in aim. <em>De cognitione Dei et nostri</em>
(1656), a collection of disputations, dealt with theological topics,
often from an explicitly Cartesian perspective. <em>Paraphrasis in
Renati Des Cartes meditationes de prima philosophiae</em> (1658) was
the first comprehensive commentary on the <em>Meditations</em>,
written with the clear intent to make Cartesian philosophy &ldquo;more
suitable for use in the schools&rdquo; (&ldquo;Praefatio&rdquo;, OO
I.346). In 1660 Clauberg returned to systematic philosophy with a new
edition of his ontology, <em>Ontosophia nova</em>, which now betrayed
a clear influence of Cartesian metaphysics. In 1664 Clauberg published
its third and final version, now titled <em>Metaphysica de ente quae
rectius ontosophia.</em> This was accompanied by an ambitious
<em>Physica</em> to serve as a comprehensive course in Cartesian
natural philosophy, covering general physics, special physics, and
psychology. The quadripartite <em>Physica</em> begins with a summary
of theses in <em>Physica contracta</em>; next is a series of
thirty-five disputations, <em>Disputationes physicae</em>, many of
which are commentaries on key sections of Part II of Descartes&rsquo;s
<em>Principles</em>; this is followed by a part treating animate
bodies, <em>Theoria corporum viventium</em>; natural philosophy is
capped by an extended treatise on the mind-body problem, <em>Corporis
et animae in homine conjunctio</em>.</p>

<p>
The last decades of the seventeenth century witnessed a surge of
interest in Clauberg in Central Europe. A number of texts appeared
that were either pseudo-Claubergian or presented Claubergian theses as
interventions in fresh controversies around Cartesianism, fuelled by
the appearance of Spinoza&rsquo;s writings. These included Johann
Heinrich Schweizer&rsquo;s <em>Compendium physicae
Aristotelico-Cartesianae</em> in Z&uuml;rich (1685), Paul Michael
Rhegenius&rsquo;s <em>Johannis Claubergii specimen logicae
Cartesianae</em> and <em>Johannis Claubergii Physica Contracta</em> in
Leipzig (1689), and Johannes Flender&rsquo;s <em>Phosphorus
philosophicus</em> in Amsterdam (1696), a commentary on
Clauberg&rsquo;s <em>Logica contracta</em> (for discussion of these
texts, see Ragni forthcoming). An anonymous text titled after
Clauberg&rsquo;s 1655 <em>Initiatio philosophi sive dubitatio
Cartesiana</em> appeared in Thuringia in 1687 (Strazzoni forthcoming).
Also in the late 1680s, Clauberg got caught up in controversies around
Cartesianism in Hesse-Kassel (Hamid 2023). Amid this revival of
interest in Clauberg, his <em>Opera omnia philosophica</em> were
published in Amsterdam in 1691 by Johann Theodor Schalbruch, with a
biographical essay by one Heinrich Christian von Hennin. The <em>Opera
omnia</em> included most but not all of Clauberg&rsquo;s writings
published in his lifetime, as well as some unpublished texts such as a
collection of notes on Descartes&rsquo;s <em>Principles of
Philosophy</em>, and Clauberg&rsquo;s correspondence with Tobias
Andreae. Among the texts left out of Schalbruch&rsquo;s edition is the
curious <em>Ars etymologica Teutonum</em> (1663), an investigation
into the origins of German words, specifically
&ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; words such as &ldquo;<em lang="de">Vernunft</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;reason&rdquo;), &ldquo;<em lang="de">suchen</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;to seek&rdquo;), and &ldquo;<em lang="de">Ausspruch</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;sentence&rdquo;) (see Gellera
2022 for an account).</p>

<p>
Another minor essay, and the only one Clauberg published in German, is
the <em>Unterscheid zwischen der cartesianischer und der sonst in
Schulen gebr&auml;uchlicher Philosophie</em> (1657), which appears in
<em>Opera omnia</em> in Latin as <em>Differentia inter Cartesianam et
alias in scholis usitatam philosophiam conscripta</em>. This polemic
on behalf of the superiority of Cartesianism over scholasticism lays
bare a key motif running through Clauberg&rsquo;s work, namely a
belief in the fundamental harmony between Descartes and the ancient
Aristotle. Alongside his advocacy of Descartes&rsquo;s system,
Clauberg is equally committed to its compatibility with
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy. Thus, after noting fifteen respects in
which Cartesianism is preferable to scholasticism, Clauberg concludes
<em>Unterscheid</em> by declaring that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I have contrasted the Cartesian philosophy with the scholastic, but
not with the Aristotelian in and of itself [&hellip;] which in many
basic respects agrees more with the Cartesian than with the school
philosophy. (<em>Unterscheid</em>, &sect;81)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clauberg often advertised his work as <em lang="la">novantiqua</em>,
and specifically as aiming to recover the true Aristotelian philosophy
from centuries of scholastic misreadings. His project belongs to a
wider phenomenon of Aristotelian revival in seventeenth-century German
Protestantism, which emphasized a humanist interest in reading
Aristotle and his ancient commentators in the original languages and,
therewith, sought to undermine his entrenched association with
Thomistic theology (Trevisani 1993; Hamid 2020).</p>

<h2 id="LogHer">2. Logic and Hermeneutics</h2>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s <em>Logica vetus et nova</em> (1654) is sometimes
called the first &ldquo;Cartesian&rdquo; logic textbook. Like Antoine
Arnauld and Pierre Nicole&rsquo;s <em>La logique ou l&rsquo;art de
penser</em>, or the <em>Port Royal Logic</em> (1662), it was received
by contemporaries as an introduction and supplement to
Descartes&rsquo;s philosophy. The <em>Logica</em> went through
multiple editions and reprints, and a Dutch translation of its first
part appeared in 1657. Spinoza owned a copy of <em>Logica</em> (as
well as <em>Defensio cartesiana</em>). Arnauld and Nicole learned of
Clauberg&rsquo;s logic only once the <em>Port Royal Logic</em> had
already gone to press, though they still managed to draw on it in Part
III of their work. Clauberg also published a much shorter <em>Logica
contracta</em>, which went through numerous reprintings well into the
eighteenth century.</p>

<h3 id="AimStrLogVetEtNov">2.1 Aims and Structure of <em>Logica vetus et nova</em></h3>

<p>
As with the <em>Port Royal Logic</em>, the Cartesian element of
Clauberg&rsquo;s <em>Logica</em> consists in a new semantic foundation
of clear and distinct perceptions, and a new epistemological focus on
the goal of avoiding error, rather than in an alternative to the
theory of syllogism (Savini 2006; Coqui 2008). Indeed, not only does
Clauberg gloss his logic as &ldquo;<em lang="la">aristotelico-cartesiana</em>&rdquo;
(<em>Init. phil.</em>
&ldquo;Praefatio&rdquo;, OO II.1124), he suggests that
Descartes&rsquo;s criticisms of logic were not directed at
Aristotelian syllogistic itself but rather at how logic was taught in
the schools of his time, which put undue emphasis on strategies for
topical argumentation (<em>Def. cart.</em> X.2, OO II.973). For
Clauberg, the general part of the Aristotelian organon, or the
doctrine of terms, propositions, and inferences, constitutes logic in
the strict sense. What Descartes contributes is the insight that
logical formalisms cannot yield knowledge unless the mind is already
in possession of clear and distinct perceptions. For the purpose of
<em lang="la">scientia</em>, consequently, training the mind to
proceed in a manner conducive to grasping veridical ideas and avoiding
error becomes paramount. Descartes&rsquo;s four rules in Part II of
the <em>Discourse on Method</em> provide such training as well as the
basis for the effective use of Aristotle&rsquo;s rules of
inference.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, Clauberg embraces the humanist <em>topos</em>, rooted in
Cicero&rsquo;s <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> III.1, of logic as a
medicine of the mind:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The diseases of the mind are errors, doubt and the other imperfections
[&hellip;] for which logic was invented as medicine. (<em>Logica</em>
&ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, I.11, OO II.770)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first task of logic, accordingly, is to identify and remedy
cognitive imperfections. Clauberg anticipates the objection that
reason could not act as its own physician and liberate itself from its
ailments. In response, he distinguishes &ldquo;natural&rdquo; from
&ldquo;artificial&rdquo; logic and affirms that the mind&rsquo;s
native capacity for judgment and inference is the foundation of any
formal logical art, and also the source of any truth that artificial
logic might yield. That is, before learning logical formalisms, the
mind is already equipped with the capacity for concept formation,
judgment, and inference. Yet, Clauberg defends the necessity of formal
logic by advancing a standard Aristotelian view, that art perfects
nature: while natural logic is indeed ontologically prior to the
artificial, &ldquo;it is not absolutely sufficient, if it is not
aided, corrected, perfected by art&rdquo; (<em>Logica</em>
&ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, V.98, OO II.778). Formal logic, or
Aristotelian syllogistic, thus serves as a necessary instrument by
which reason is able to amend its errors. Accordingly, the <em lang="la">medicina
mentis</em> conception of logic turns out to be
compatible with another view of logic as the &ldquo;art of using
reason correctly&rdquo; (<em lang="la">ars ratione recte utendi</em>),
or the &ldquo;art which directs and guides the human mind in the
cognition of things&rdquo; (<em>Log. contr.</em> &sect;1, OO
II.913).</p>

<p>
This view of logic yields four distinct aims, which in turn ground a
quadripartite division of <em>Logica</em>. Of these, the first two
divisions constitute what Clauberg calls the &ldquo;genetic&rdquo;
part, and the latter two the &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; part of logic. The
basis of this twofold distinction is that in the former the intellect
examines its own thoughts, whereas in the latter it examines the
thoughts of others. The further divisions within the genetic and
analytic halves rest on a separate distinction, with clear Stoic and
Augustinian precedent, between internal and external discourse (<em lang="la">sermo
internus/externus</em>). The four parts of
<em>Logica</em> have the following titles:</p>

</ol>

<h3 id="Log">2.2 Logic</h3>

<p>
The first aim, corresponding to Part I, is the removal of errors and
prejudices acquired since childhood. Here, the standard of clear and
distinct perception together with Descartes&rsquo;s methodological
precepts for training attention and judgment furnish the basis for the
effective use of syllogisms in ridding the mind of false beliefs and
validating true ones. Put differently, Part I of <em>Logica</em> is
concerned with the cultivation of good mental habits aided by explicit
rules of inquiry, which are then supplemented by formal techniques for
the evaluation of judgments. The theory of syllogism is not discarded
but is subordinated to Descartes&rsquo;s epistemological strictures
that cast intellectual intuition rather than the form of reasoning as
the criterion of truth. Crucially, Clauberg regards this part as
constituting logic in the strict sense, and the remaining parts as its
extension (<em>Logica</em> &ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, VI.104, OO
II.779; &ldquo;Proemium&rdquo; to 1654 ed.). As he puts it, the aim of
correctly forming one&rsquo;s own thoughts would remain in force
even</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if there were only one person living on the face of the earth, or
several among whom there was no society, [and] there were no one to
manifest his thoughts to others. (<em>Logica</em>
&ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, VI.107, OO II.779)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The extensions of logic deal with pedagogical and hermeneutical aims,
and effectively replace the dialectical parts of earlier logic
textbooks. First among these auxiliaries is the &ldquo;external&rdquo;
half of <em lang="la">logica genetica</em>, which aims at the
economical and accurate expression of one&rsquo;s well-formed
thoughts. It reflects Clauberg&rsquo;s abiding interest in pedagogy
and with reforming the arts curriculum, for which end he finds
Descartes&rsquo;s pared-down ontology and rejection of dialectical
disputation especially promising (Efal-Lautenschl&auml;ger 2023).
Clauberg emphasizes that this part of logic should not be confused
with grammar and rhetoric. These latter disciplines deal with the
conventional rules of linguistic expressions and with their ornament
for the purposes of persuasion. By contrast, the external part of
genetic logic aims only &ldquo;to explain concepts to others in a way
adapted to the first part&rdquo;. Thus, whereas the first part deals,
for instance, with the nature and use of universals, with definition,
division, and the rules of syllogistic inference, the second part
teaches how to communicate thoughts in a way that clearly exemplifies
logical structure, so that &ldquo;another could also know what we
know&rdquo; (<em>Logica</em> &ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, VI.113, OO
II.780). Clauberg concludes this part by underscoring the dangers of
excessive focus on the common art of disputation, which his new logic
intends to replace in the trivium: an immoderate use of topical
dialectics in teaching makes men &ldquo;audacious without
modesty&rdquo;, &ldquo;arrogant&rdquo;, and produces individuals
disposed to &ldquo;nitpicking and quarreling for the rest of their
lives&rdquo; (<em>Logica</em> II.xvi.116, OO II.839).</p>

<h3 id="Her">2.3 Hermeneutics</h3>

<p>
The third and fourth parts of logic constitute the
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo;, or logic as it concerns the thoughts of
others, and deal with two interrelated aims of learning. The first is
to examine carefully the meanings and significations contained in a
text in order to avoid misunderstanding the intentions of a speaker or
writer. The second is to assess the duly established spoken or written
text for truth and falsity (<em>Logica</em> &ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;,
V.103, OO II.779). In these parts, Clauberg rigorously articulates a
distinction between the true intended meaning of a text and truth as
such, which has striking echoes in Meyer&rsquo;s and Spinoza&rsquo;s
Biblical hermeneutics (Lagr&eacute;e 2002; Verbeek 2005). The third
part of <em>Logica</em> ranks, alongside Johann Conrad
Dannhauer&rsquo;s (1603&ndash;66) <em lang="la">Idea boni interpretis
et malitiosi calumniatoris</em> (1630), among the seminal early modern
expositions of a theory of text interpretation (Detel 2011; Del Prete
2015).</p>

<p>
Clauberg develops his theory of hermeneutics from a causal model of
texts. For Clauberg, words and sentences are not merely signs of
concepts and judgments, but rather effects whose efficient causes are
their author&rsquo;s thoughts. And, just as agential efficient causes
require various <em lang="la">sine quibus non</em> conditions for
their exercise, texts also depend on factors such as the time and
place of their composition, the norms of style and usage influencing
their authors, and the expectations of their audiences
(<em>Logica</em> III.iii.12, OO II.846). Interpreting any text thus
requires grasping the manifold causes and necessary conditions
involved in its production. Most important of all, however, is
understanding authorial intention, as the principal efficient cause of
a text. In this regard, Clauberg formulates an overarching principle
of charity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One must prefer the meaning which does not involve any absurdity, and
reject the one which seems not to be appropriate, with regard to what
it deals with, or does less honor to the author. (<em>Logica</em>
III.xiii.86, OO II.862)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Clauberg, a good interpreter chooses the more benign among
multiple available interpretations, considers all reasons that support
it, accepts several meanings if they appear equally likely, refrains
from condemning a text without good reason, and does not punish minor
errors by blanket refutations. He casts this principle as an extension
of Christian charity, as an expression of the &ldquo;laws of
humanity&rdquo;, which enjoin goodwill toward fellow human beings.
Clauberg has high hopes that his general hermeneutics might be of
service in his &ldquo;perverse century&rdquo; of religious
polemics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In this perverse century, as there are many who know very well how to
twist words into a strange meaning, misconstruing what great writers
have presented well, it is up to analytic hermeneutics to separate not
only the interpreter&rsquo;s idea from the temperament of the
calumniator so that the logician can recognize what is true
interpretation, what is calumny, who is a good interpreter, [and] who
is a calumniator and a malicious sycophant. (<em>Logica</em>
&ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, VI.124, OO II.782)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s motives in including a theory of hermeneutics in the
logic curriculum are also more specific than effecting a general
change in the literary culture of his time. Armed with his new
conception of logic, he takes a position on an issue hotly contested
in German academia since Luther and Melanchthon, namely of the limits
of philosophy&rsquo;s claims on the higher faculties, particularly on
theology. One common view in support of the early Reformers&rsquo;
doubts regarding the intrusion of philosophical theology in matters of
faith is that philosophical logic is unsuited for theology. This is
because theology should be treated as a matter of interpreting a
divinely inspired text guided by the light of grace, rather than of
demonstrating truths knowable by the natural light. A similar
limitation on the claims of philosophical method extends to law and
medicine, whose ultimate aim is to interpret particular circumstances
rather than to discover general truths. By contrast, Clauberg makes an
early intervention on behalf of philosophy&rsquo;s special privilege
in the early modern <em lang="de">Fakult&auml;tenstreit</em> in German
universities. Already in the Prolegomena to <em>Logica</em>, Clauberg
argues for the necessity of a science of hermeneutics for theologians
and jurisconsults (VI.124, OO II.782). He repeats this position in
<em>Unterscheid</em>, writing that philosophy, being concerned in
general with the use of reason in the discovery of truth, should lay
the ground for medicine, law, and all other disciplines (&sect;3).
Clauberg&rsquo;s commitment to the universal scope of philosophy also
underpins the central project of his <em>oeuvre</em>, ontology.</p>

<h2 id="Ont">3. Ontology</h2>

<p>
Clauberg did not coin the term &ldquo;ontology&rdquo;, as was once
believed (on the history of the term, see Devaux and Lamanna 2009).
&ldquo;Ontology&rdquo; appears as a synonym for
&ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; as early as Jacob Lorhard&rsquo;s <em>Ogdoas
scholastica</em> (1606). It then appears in Rudolph Goclenius&rsquo;s
popular <em>Lexicon philosophicum</em> (1613), where it is glossed as
&ldquo;<em lang="la">philosophia de ente seu
transcendentibus</em>&rdquo;, and designates a mode of abstraction
from matter that yields a doctrine of transcendental predicates, or
those that apply indifferently to any being whatsoever, material or
immaterial, created or uncreated. Goclenius does not develop such a
doctrine, however, nor does he clearly indicate that a separate
science of being <em lang="la">qua</em> being is needed. The first
texts to recognize ontology as a distinct part of metaphysics, prior
to the doctrines of the first being and of separable intellects, are
Abraham Calov&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysica divina</em> (1636) and Juan
Caramuel de Lobkowitz&rsquo;s <em>Rationalis et realis
philosophia</em> (1642). Clauberg was aware of both authors and
acknowledges them as forerunners in <em>Elementa philosophiae sive
ontosophia</em> (1647; IV.89). But it was Clauberg&rsquo;s
presentation that was the source of the discipline that in the
following century received its most elaborate treatment in
Wolff&rsquo;s <em>Philosophia prima sive ontologia</em> (1730), and
whose &ldquo;proud name&rdquo;, Kant later insisted, &ldquo;must give
way to the modest one of a mere analytic of the pure
understanding&rdquo; (1781/1787: A247/B303).</p>

<h3 id="OntMet">3.1 Ontology and Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
In each of the three editions of his ontology (1647, 1660, 1664),
Clauberg begins by explaining the rationale for developing ontology
separately from natural theology. In fact, in spite of his position
that philosophical methods apply to theology, a concern to disentangle
metaphysics and theology doctrinally is a consistent theme in his
work, and explains part of his attraction toward Cartesianism (e.g.,
<em>Unterscheid</em>, &sect;&sect;71&ndash;3). In the Prolegomena to
<em>Metaphysica de ente</em>, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Just as the science which deals with God is called <em>theosophy</em>
or <em>theology</em>, so that [science] which is not about this or
that being, marked by a special name or distinguished from others by a
certain property, but concerns being in general, can not
inappropriately be called <em>ontosophy</em> or <em>ontology</em>.
(&sect;4, OO I.281)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the lengthier Prolegomena to the 1647 version of ontology, Clauberg
elaborates on the need for a science of what the human intellect can
know concerning God and creatures in common. His discussion begins
with the Aristotelian dictum, that &ldquo;sciences are divided
according to the nature of things&rdquo; (<em lang="la">Scientiae
secantur ut Res</em>). Since &ldquo;whatever is in the nature of
things is either God or something which derives its origin from
God&rdquo;, two domains of real being result&mdash;the divine and the
created&mdash;to which correspond two kinds of knowledge. Moreover,
Clauberg argues that, on account of their close conceptual link, the
two sciences entail a third, which perfects our knowledge of both
divine and creaturely matters. For, despite the infinite distance
separating them, &ldquo;God and creatures have a likeness and affinity
with one another, insofar as they are related as cause and effect
[<em>causa et causatum</em>]&rdquo;. Consequently, on the one hand, a
perfect understanding of created beings requires tracing their origin
to God as their first cause and ultimate end. On the other, given the
essentially perception-dependent character of human cognition,
knowledge of God must originate from an inquiry into created nature.
Thus, Clauberg concludes that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
although nothing is prior to or higher than God, yet there is
something so common in our intellect that it may in some way
comprehend God together with other things. (<em>Elem. phil.</em>
&ldquo;Prolegomena&rdquo;, &sect;&sect;1&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Having identified that which is &ldquo;common in our intellect&rdquo;
as its subject matter, the central notion of Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology
is, accordingly, the &ldquo;intelligible&rdquo; or
&ldquo;thinkable&rdquo; (<em lang="la">Intelligibile seu
Cogitabile</em>) (<em>Elem. phil.</em> I.1&ndash;3) (see Savini 2011:
23&ndash;70, for a detailed account of the genesis of Clauberg&rsquo;s
ontology in <em>Elementa</em>; see also Marrone forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Between the 1647 and the later editions, Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology
undergoes a crucial shift in Descartes&rsquo;s direction (Carraud
1999; Collacciani 2020). Briefly, this shift consists in placing the
Cartesian doctrine of the thinking self in service of the doctrine of
being <em lang="la">qua</em> being, as the primitive source of the
common notions that supply the content of ontology. In other words,
Clauberg&rsquo;s aim in <em>Ontosophia nova</em>, as the 1660 edition
is titled, is nothing less than to reconcile the account of
transcendental attributes with Descartes&rsquo;s doctrine of
substance. In keeping with this shift, Clauberg abandons his earlier
standpoint, that knowledge of God and what it contributes to the
perfection of knowledge of nature is necessarily mediated by
reflection on perceived reality, in favor of the Cartesian position
that knowledge of one&rsquo;s own existence as a thinking thing
constitutes epistemic bedrock (Goudriaan 1999). Consequently, the
intelligibles that make up the subject matter of ontology are now
treated as generated in mere thinking.</p>

<h3 id="ThrSenBei">3.2 Three Senses of Being</h3>

<p>
The second and third editions of Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology begin by
making explicit the equivalence of being insofar as it is being and
being <em lang="la">qua intelligibile</em> (<em>Met. ente</em>
I.1&ndash;4, OO I.283). Clauberg&rsquo;s account of <em lang="la">ens</em>
proceeds in three stages, moving from its widest to
its narrowest sense. In the widest sense, &ldquo;being is whatever in
any way can be thought or said&rdquo; (<em lang="la">Ens est quicquid
quovis modo est, cogitari ac dici potest</em>; <em lang="de">Alles was
nur gedacht und gesagt werden kan</em>) (<em>Met. ente</em> II.6, OO
I.283). Any being that can be made into an object of thought is to
that extent something intelligible or thinkable. In this broadest
sense, the domain of being effectively extends to the bounds of
discursivity, and encompasses even non-being or the non-intelligible
(<em lang="la">Non ens sive Non intelligibile</em>) insofar as it can
be an object of language or thought. <em>Non ens</em> has the status
of a being of reason (<em lang="la">ens rationis</em>), but is not
strictly speaking outside the realm of being, because it is within the
bounds of discourse (<em>Met. ente</em> II.9, OO I.284).
Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology thus begins not so much with the concept of
being as such, but rather with thinkable or conceptualizable being. In
the broadest sense, the content of being as <em lang="la">esse
objectivum</em> is exhausted by the possible contents of thought
(Leinsle 1988: 99&ndash;104; Carraud 1999; Bardout 1999).</p>

<p>
Narrowing the range of <em lang="la">ens</em>, in the second sense
Clauberg characterizes being as what can be conceived to exist in
reality, as <em lang="la">esse reale</em> or <em lang="la">esse
positivum</em>. This stage results from dividing being <em lang="la">qua
intelligibile</em> into something (<em lang="la">aliquid</em>)
and nothing (<em lang="la">nihil</em>). <em lang="la">Aliquid</em>
signifies &ldquo;what does not involve any
repugnance in our thinking&rdquo;, in virtue of excluding
contradictions, such as &ldquo;four-sided circle&rdquo; or
&ldquo;leaden gold-coin&rdquo; (<em>Met. ente</em> III.18, OO I.285).
To <em lang="la">esse reale</em> or <em lang="la">aliquid</em> thus
corresponds the domain of possible existence, whether in the mind or
in the material world. He sets down as an axiom that, &ldquo;for
reality it is sufficient that something could be, although in fact it
does not exist&rdquo;, for which he glosses &ldquo;could be&rdquo;
(<em lang="la">esse possit</em>) as &ldquo;does not imply a
contradiction&rdquo; (<em lang="la">non implicet contradictionem</em>)
(<em>Met. ente</em> III.21, OO I.285). The division of intelligible
being into something and nothing thus introduces the principle of
non-contradiction as the first formal principle of ontology. Whereas
<em lang="la">ens</em> in its widest signification as <em lang="la">esse
objectivum</em> picks out the bounds of discourse, <em lang="la">aliquid</em>
or <em lang="la">esse reale</em> marks the
domain of truth-aptness, or of contents that could be evaluated for
truth or falsity. Crucially, for Clauberg, the conceptual gap between
<em lang="la">esse objectivum</em> and <em lang="la">esse reale</em>,
or between merely intelligible and possibly existent being, is what
permits positing Descartes&rsquo;s <em lang="la">cogito</em> as a
prior, non-formal principle of being. For, the first division of being
into something and nothing presupposes the activity of a mind (<em lang="la">mens
cogitans</em>) reflecting on its own thought contents
(<em>Met. ente</em> III.26, note &ldquo;p&rdquo;, OO I.286).</p>

<p>
In the third and narrowest sense, being signifies real being (<em lang="la">Res</em>
or <em lang="la">Ens reale</em>), that is,
substances. <em>Res/ens reale</em> picks out the category of substance
as distinguished from its modes, for instance, as a cap has a certain
shape, or a mind its power of understanding (<em>Met. ente</em> IV.42,
OO I.290). It is in this sense of being that Clauberg in 1660/1664
makes another notable shift toward Descartes. He defines substance in
a manner that he takes to be common to Aristotle and Descartes:
substance is &ldquo;whatever exists in such a way that it does not
need a subject in which to exist&rdquo;. Among items that depend on
substance, Clauberg eschews the language of accidents for modes, and
distinguishes the &ldquo;accidental and separable&rdquo; modes of
things (<em lang="la">modi rerum</em>) from their &ldquo;essential and
inseparable&rdquo; attributes, which he also calls, following
Descartes, modes of thinking (<em lang="la">modi cogitandi</em>)
(<em>Met. ente</em> IV.44, OO I.290). The third sense of being is
properly reached by making a distinction between <em>aliquid</em> and
<em>res</em> as between an attribute and a substance, or between what
has reality in another (<em lang="la">in alio</em>) and what has
reality in and through itself (<em lang="la">in se &amp; per se</em>)
(<em>Met. ente</em> III.41, OO I.289).</p>

<h3 id="SubAtt">3.3 Substance and Attribute</h3>

<p>
Clauberg explains the relation between substance, attribute, and mode
in terms of dependence. Modes depend on attributes, and attributes
depend on substances. Certain modes presuppose certain attributes, as
motions and shapes presuppose extension, and imaginings and desirings
presuppose thought. Modes and attributes share the feature of being
dependent insofar as they have reality in virtue of inhering in
substances. But they are not distinguished from substance in the same
way. Substance is properly opposed to mode, for only the latter
denotes concrete states that occur in the former&mdash;or more
accurately, in finite or mutable substance (<em>Met. ente</em> IV.45,
OO I.290). By contrast, Clauberg regards the distinction between
attribute and substance as strictly conceptual. That is, attributes
are not general properties inhering in substances of which modes are
particular instances&mdash;Clauberg marks that contrast by
distinguishing two species of modes, immediate and mediate, such as
the property of motion as such in a horse and its determinate speed at
a given moment (<em>Met. ente</em> IV.46, OO I.290). Instead, an
attribute is a universal aspect under which a simple substance can be
thought. Attributes depend on substances insofar as what is simple in
itself is considered in diverse ways, as, for instance, body may be
considered as an existing thing or an enduring thing or an extended
thing. To call attributes <em lang="la">modi cogitandi</em> is to call
them ways of thinking about a substance, rather than distinct ways a
substance is or might be (<em>Met. ente</em> IV.44, OO I.290).</p>

<p>
In the list of attributes, Clauberg includes not only
Descartes&rsquo;s common attributes of existence, duration, and unity
but also the catalogue of <em lang="la">transcendentalia</em> as
accepted in the Scotistic tradition. Attributes thus include both the
absolute ones such as unity, truth, and goodness and the disjunctive
transcendentals, or those which divide being without remainder, such
as cause/caused, prior/posterior, whole/part, simple/complex,
subject/adjunct, and sign/signified. He follows Descartes, however, in
maintaining that every substance has one attribute through which its
nature becomes most intelligible, or clearly and distinctly perceived
(<em>Met. ente</em> IV.47, OO I.291). To identify these primary
attributes, he conceives <em lang="la">ens reale</em> with reference
to those features which are &ldquo;maximally opposed and
contrary&rdquo; and at the same time positively intelligible, or can
be grasped through a positive concept. The salient examples of these
are extension in bodies and intellect and will in minds,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
seeing that neither intellect and will can be ascribed to length,
breadth, and depth, nor length, breadth, and depth to intellect and
will. (<em>Met. ente</em> IV.48, OO I.291)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The notion of a primary attribute further underpins Clauberg&rsquo;s
account of essence.</p>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s theory of attributes drives a key shift in his
doctrine of essence between the 1647 edition and the two later ones.
The definition of essence in all three editions is the same: essence
is &ldquo;that whole through which a thing both is, and is what it
is&rdquo; (<em lang="la">totum illud, per quod res &amp; est, &amp;
est id quod est</em>) (<em>Elem. phil.</em> II.47; <em>Met. ente</em>
V.60, OO I.293). But, whereas in 1647, Clauberg takes essence to
denote the first real attribute (<em lang="la">attributum reale
primum</em>), which constitutes a substance as a certain kind of
thing, in the later editions essence becomes, as <em>modus
cogitandi</em>, the root and fundament (<em lang="la">radix et
fundamentum</em>) of the conceivability of a substance and of what is
and is not possible in it (<em>Met. ente</em> V.56, OO I.292; see
Leinsle 1988: 102&ndash;03). To be sure, Clauberg includes in his
account of essence much of what is common in scholastic accounts:
essence is what is presupposed in any actuality of a substance; it is
quiddity, or what answers to the definition of a thing; essence does
not permit of greater or lesser, is indivisible, immutable, and is
what belongs to a substance necessarily (<em>Met. ente</em>
V.61&ndash;6, OO I.293&ndash;5). But he turns in Descartes&rsquo;s
direction in two crucial respects. First, he locates his later
doctrine of essence at the level of thought about substances.
Essences, like attributes generally, are strictly conceptual
structures that make truth-apt representation of substance possible.
Second, Clauberg&rsquo;s doctrine of essence now entails a rejection
of the hylomorphic theory of substance. This is because Clauberg takes
primary attributes to ground the completeness of a substance. For,
while every attribute of a substance belongs to it essentially, the
primary attribute is that through which a substance is conceived as a
subsistent thing capable of a certain class of modes and not others.
Thus, to conceive a substance through the attribute of extension is to
conceive it as possessing conditions of unity, perfection, or
causality in geometrical but not mentalistic terms. Furthermore, to
conceive something under a primary attribute is to conceive it as
capable of existence through God&rsquo;s creative power alone, without
requiring unification with any other substance. Clauberg thus arrives
at the Cartesian view of substance as a complete, simple subject,
independent of all other beings except God.</p>

<p>
At the heart of Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology is his theory of attributes,
which furnishes an account of substances and their properties insofar
as they are conceivable and, therefore, metaphysically possible. Like
Descartes, for Clauberg, the conceivability of something consists in
its clear and distinct perception by the mind; its possibility,
meanwhile, rests in an adequate power to produce it. As he puts the
relation between conceivability and possibility:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we gather that something is possible, that is, it can be produced by
some cause, at least by God, from the fact that it can be clearly and
distinctly perceived as such by our mind. (<em>Met. ente</em> VI.88,
OO I.298)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology articulates the fundamental notions that
compose real possibilities, or candidates for existence. Existence
itself, meanwhile, is one of the non-primary attributes of any
actualized real being, trivially defined as the attribute &ldquo;by
which a being is in act, or, by which it has an essence constituted in
act in the world&rdquo; (<em>Met. ente</em> VI.78, OO I.296). Clauberg
thus lays the ground for a formula that would be commonly used in the
early modern German tradition, that &ldquo;existence is the complement
of possibility&rdquo; (&ldquo;<em>Erf&uuml;llung des M&ouml;glichen
ist eben dasjenige, was wir W&uuml;rcklichkeit
nennen</em>&rdquo;/&ldquo;Existentiam <em>definio per complementum
possibilitatis</em>&rdquo;; Wolff, <em>German Metaphysics</em>
&sect;14; and <em>Ontologia</em> &sect;174).</p>

<p>
A further legacy of Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology is its tenuous
separation from logic. While he succeeded in promoting ontology as
general metaphysics, and in particular as a secular form of first
philosophy distinct from and prior to theology in the system of
sciences, its separation from logic remained less clear. A tension
between logic and ontology, which Kant powerfully exploited in the
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, lies at the heart of
Clauberg&rsquo;s doctrine of being, specifically in the sense of <em lang="la">aliquid</em>
or <em lang="la">esse reale</em>. For the space
of real possibility, on Clauberg&rsquo;s account, turns out to be
coextensive with merely logical possibility, defined by the principle
of non-contradiction. The domain of real being is thus in principle
fully articulable by syllogistic reasoning informed by the catalogue
of ontological concepts. Despite Clauberg&rsquo;s insistence on a
sharp divide between ontology and logic&mdash;that the former deals
with reality as such and the latter serves as its instrument&mdash;the
line between logical and ontological principles would get increasingly
blurry in the German metaphysical tradition leading up to Wolff.</p>

<h2 id="Phy">4. Physics</h2>

<p>
Whereas Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology features the insertion of selected
Cartesian doctrines in a broadly neo-scholastic framework, the general
part of his physics appears more readily as an attempt to render
Descartes in Aristotelian language. It shares the spirit of earlier
programs to update Aristotelian natural philosophy. His teacher
Johannes de Raey, in <em>Clavis philosophiae naturalis</em> (1654),
had already touted Descartes&rsquo;s physics as the completion of
Aristotelian philosophy (Strazzoni 2011). Clauberg himself suggests
the affinity of his project with one of the most influential programs
to renovate Aristotelian natural philosophy in the preceding century,
Julius Caesar Scaliger&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;Aristotelian
corpuscularianism&rdquo; (e.g., <em>Disp. phys.</em> XIX.1, XX.8; on
Scaliger&rsquo;s natural philosophy, see L&uuml;thy 2001). In contrast
to Clauberg&rsquo;s ontology, however, the impact of his physics was
indirect and limited. From a historical standpoint, its main interest
lies in its being, as de Buzon (2017: 100) puts it, &ldquo;a good
indicator, positively or negatively, of the metaphysical situation of
physical concepts in Cartesianism&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Two themes in Clauberg&rsquo;s <em>Disputationes physicae</em>
exemplify his contribution in drawing to the surface certain tensions
in Descartes&rsquo;s physics. The first has to do with the nature of
corporeal substance. At its heart lies an ambiguity in
Descartes&rsquo;s texts concerning the number and identity of
corporeal substance: whether it refers only to <em lang="la">res
extensa</em> considered universally, or whether individual extended
bodies separately qualify as substances. Clauberg&rsquo;s response to
this and closely related issues, such as whether individual bodies are
true subjects of corporeal properties, illustrate his strategy of
retooling scholastic terminology to fit Cartesian physics. A second
theme concerns Clauberg&rsquo;s account of how Cartesian laws of
nature qualify as causes of motion.</p>

<h3 id="CorSub">4.1 Corporeal Substance</h3>

<p>
Clauberg is unequivocal in his embrace of Descartes&rsquo;s concept of
material substance as <em lang="la">res extensa</em>: &ldquo;To be a
body is to be an extended thing&rdquo; (<em>Disp. phys.</em> III, OO
I.56). The question of the individuation of corporeal substance arises
with the consideration of what it is that God conserves in existence:
matter as such or particular material things (i.e., bodies). Here,
Clauberg begins by deploying a distinction between primary and
secondary matter (<em lang="la">materia prima/secunda</em>): the
former refers to extension &ldquo;simpliciter and universally
considered&rdquo;, and the latter to &ldquo;something extended in this
or that way, having this or that form&rdquo;. Primary matter or <em lang="la">res
extensa</em> is the totality of extension in the
universe, the quantity of which does not change; secondary matter
denotes a certain quantity of matter formed or arranged in some
definite manner, which can be increased or decreased, and which always
occurs in a collection of other, variously arranged packets of matter
(<em>Disp. phys.</em> IV.15&ndash;7, OO I.58). Clauberg&rsquo;s
question then becomes whether primary matter&mdash;<em lang="la">res
extensa</em> as such&mdash;or secondary matter&mdash;this or that
extended body&mdash;is the ultimate subject of predication, and hence
corporeal substance in the strict sense. It gives rise to the further
question, whether corporeal properties of figure, place, or motion
belong to matter considered universally or to this or that body.</p>

<p>
Clauberg grants that, since the essence of any individual body
consists in extension, corporeal properties inhere in it, and so, in a
certain respect, it counts as a subject of corporeal predicates. But
he recognizes the deeper problem stemming from Descartes&rsquo;s view,
that an individual body is nothing but universal extension arranged in
some definite form. In other words, although we talk about a table as
having a certain shape or volume, it cannot be the ultimate subject of
these properties, but rather those properties inhere in <em lang="la">res
extensa</em> as such, a certain quantity of which now
exists table-wise. Affirming the substantial priority and unity of <em lang="la">res
extensa</em>, Clauberg writes that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
extension, in which divisibility, figure, place, and the other
corporeal properties exist [is] the adequate subject by which all
things in a body are sustained. (<em>Disp. phys.</em> VI.17, OO
I.65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a strict sense, for Clauberg, the material universe constitutes a
single corporeal substance variously formed in this or that region
(for a detailed account, see Mercer 1999).</p>

<p>
What, then, explains the relation between primary matter, or <em lang="la">res
extensa</em>, and secondary matter, the individual
bodies that express determinate shapes, positions, and motions? For
Clauberg, the various arrangements of extension do not result from any
active principles in bodies. He emphatically rejects the doctrine of
substantial forms as being unintelligible and explanatorily idle
(<em>Disp. phys.</em> XII, OO I.79&ndash;84). By form, he writes, can
be meant nothing more than, for example, the shape, size, and bulk of
a key that makes it suited to turn certain locks, or similar
properties of a pen that make it suitable for writing. &ldquo;Besides
this&rdquo;, he writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in what way substantial forms are needed or in what way, if they
existed, they would contribute, cannot even be understood. (<em>Disp.
phys.</em> XII.38, OO I.83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To be a body is to be essentially extended, and extension is passive
or inert. How extension comes to be formed in definite ways is
explained, instead, by laws of nature.</p>

<h3 id="LawCau">4.2 Laws and Causes</h3>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s account of laws is the second major theme through
which he exposes a key tension in Cartesian natural philosophy. Like
many readers of Descartes, Clauberg is struck by his claim that
&ldquo;rules or laws of nature [&hellip;] are the secondary and
particular causes&rdquo; of bodily motions (<em>Principles</em> II.37,
AT VIIIA.62). How could laws be causes, given that causes are supposed
to be substances endowed with powers to produce certain effects? Laws
at best seem to describe the characteristic patterns of activity of
natural substances, but not to denote causal powers. In what sense,
then, do Descartes&rsquo;s laws of nature count as causes? In
Clauberg&rsquo;s treatment, the main contenders for the role of the
causes of bodily motion are the divine will and a suitably modified
notion of corporeal powers. His commentary on <em>Principles</em>
II.36&ndash;44 in <em>Disputationes</em> XVIII&ndash;XXII
perspicuously draws out the tension between the occasionalist and
realist alternatives that has long divided readers of Descartes.</p>

<p>
Clauberg&rsquo;s discussion of the causes of motion begins with two
pairs of distinctions. The first is between &ldquo;the universal and
primary cause that produces all motions that are in the totality of
corporeal things&rdquo;, or God; and &ldquo;the particular and
secondary cause from which proceed various and diverse motions in each
part of the world&rdquo; (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XVIII.5, OO I.97).
Then, on the traditional distinction between divine and secondary
causes, Clauberg overlays two distinct meanings of
&ldquo;cause&rdquo;, as substance or thing, and as a law that governs
the action of a substance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By a particular cause we may nominally understand either some thing
[<em lang="la">rem</em>] which produces motion, or a <em>rule</em> or
law and reason [<em lang="la">regulam sive legem ac rationem</em>]
according to which motion is produced. (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XVIII.6,
OO I.97)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the first sense, primary and secondary causes are distinguished in
terms of their proper effects: God&rsquo;s action results in
&ldquo;the universal movement of the whole world&rdquo;, whereas
creaturely effects are restricted to &ldquo;some movement in a part of
the world&rdquo; (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XVIII.7, OO I.97). This
distinction in scope has implications for the specificity of any
observable change. While every motion depends on God having imparted
motion to <em lang="la">res extensa</em>, from particular causes we
understand the various kinds of corporeal motion, such as ascending,
descending, flowing, rotating, or projectile, that are produced in
this or that part of matter. Clauberg illustrates the second sense of
cause, as rule or law, meanwhile, by appeal to political and
theological metaphors. Thus, the universal cause may be likened to a
king, and the particular causes to the laws by which he governs his
subjects; or, God&rsquo;s universal causality may be contrasted with
the Word of God as the particular cause by which God rules over his
creation.</p>

<p>
The distinction between cause as <em lang="la">res</em> and <em lang="la">lex</em>
is only relevant when dealing with secondary
causes. God as primary cause qualifies in the fullest sense both as
substance, who produces matter by his power, and also as the source of
the law by which it operates. By contrast, the two senses of secondary
cause&mdash;as the source of distinct kinds of motion, and as
law&mdash;do not appear to have equal significance. For Clauberg, the
particular causes of fluid or projectile motions belong to special
branches of physics in which the various properties of bodies that
result in characteristic patterns of motion are to be described. In
<em lang="la">physica generalis</em>, however, the relevant sense of
particular cause is the one akin to laws in politics or to the Word of
God in theology, as the means for the primary agent&rsquo;s governance
of nature (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XVIII.8, OO I.98). This picture, along
with Clauberg&rsquo;s view that God&rsquo;s conservation of nature
entails its continual creation, suggests an occasionalist cosmology,
insofar as God appears to be the only genuine agent of change
(<em>Cog. Dei</em> XXIX, OO II.645&ndash;6; see Weier 1981).</p>

<p>
But Clauberg&rsquo;s further discussion of laws and causes complicates
the issue. In the same disputation, he also makes clear that
God&rsquo;s primary causality endows bodies with two features: the
power of moving (<em lang="la">virtutem movendi</em>) and motion
itself (<em lang="la">motum ipsum</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
From this supreme perfection and power of God, it follows that God not
only bestows the power of moving on all things, and conserves and
applies it; but also gives motion to things, and conserves and applies
it. (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XVIII.12, OO I.98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And in <em>Disputatio</em> XIX, he indicates that not only rational
agents but also material things are causes in the sense of <em lang="la">res</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For just as God imposed moral laws on things endowed with reason,
which act well by observing them but sin by transgressing them; so he
willed that all natural things should always be moved and rested in a
certain order, by certain laws, which laws those things themselves, as
necessary causes, cannot fail to observe. (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XIX.1,
OO I.103)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems that God&rsquo;s causal activity generates not only matter
and a conserved quantity of motion, but also motive powers in things,
even if corporeal substances are devoid of reason and, therefore,
incapable of violating natural laws. What might ground such powers in
bodies? It cannot be the essence of matter, which is to be strictly
passive quantity. Yet, Clauberg is committed to the claim that, given
that motion exists in bodies, there must be in them a power of
moving.</p>

<p>
The following four disputations&mdash;which treat Descartes&rsquo;s
law of inertial motion, the explanation of projectile motion, the law
of rectilinear and centrifugal motion, and the law of
collisions&mdash;suggest the outlines of a realist account. Briefly,
Clauberg suggests that God&rsquo;s creation of matter subject to
necessary laws confers upon it natural tendencies, for example, to
remain in the same state, to move in a straight path, and to move or
be moved by other bodies. The tendencies of bodies as stated in
Cartesian laws are necessary relational properties, whose relata are
God&rsquo;s will on the one hand, and the direction and quantity of
motion present in any finite volume on the other. Such tendencies are
certainly not powers in the sense in which an Aristotelian natural
philosopher would understand the term; they are not qualitative powers
to actualize matter, such as the power of heating that makes fire hot
and disposes it to burn paper. Yet, for Clauberg, the directional
tendencies of bodies are nevertheless causal inasmuch as they endow
them with features by which they determine changes of state in other
bodies. They are necessary, moreover, inasmuch as they are partly
grounded in God&rsquo;s immutable will to conserve matter and its
total quantity of motion (see Hamid forthcoming). Ultimately, for
Clauberg, the attribution of causal powers, hence activity, to bodies
is required by a proper understanding of God as primary cause:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Just as God is the author of all truth, whence the common ideas and
theorems of eternal truth depend [&hellip;] so he is the author of all
order in Nature, whence the Laws of Nature proceed. About which, if
anyone continues to dispute, let us say that, indeed, God (naturing
nature [<em lang="la">naturam naturantem</em>]) should properly
speaking act, but Nature (natured [<em lang="la">naturatam</em>])
should act according to them. For natural things act only when acted
upon, and move when they are moved. (<em>Disp. phys.</em> XIX.11, OO
I.106)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In light of subsequent German natural philosophy, Clauberg&rsquo;s
physics appears as a source of fruitful tensions. The examples of
Johann Christoph Sturm and Leibniz exemplify two directions in which
the Cartesian problems of corporeal form and causation, as adumbrated
by Clauberg, lead. On the one hand, Sturm&rsquo;s occasionalist
strategy involves a rigorous development of the notion of passive
form, already suggested in Clauberg, as <em lang="la">sine quibus
non</em> causes. That is, Sturm strictly restricts efficient causality
in matter to divine power but posits passive forms as bearers of
corporeal properties that serve to individuate bodies (see Sangiacomo
2020). On the other, Leibniz shares the Claubergian view that
God&rsquo;s primary causality requires that certain features be
inscribed in creaturely natures, which equip them to carry out divine
commands. But in rejecting the occasionalist solution, Leibniz goes
beyond Clauberg by rehabilitating active natures, which he variously
terms entelechies, substantial forms, or monads. Briefly, whereas
Sturm responds to the instability in the Claubergian-Cartesian account
of corporeal natures by introducing passive forms, Leibniz turns in
the other direction and places active principles at the center of his
account of substance. In the background to the Sturm-Leibniz debate at
the close of the seventeenth century, we may discern Clauberg&rsquo;s
reintroduction of the form/matter distinction and the
primary/secondary matter distinction into mechanistic physics.</p>

<h2 id="MinBodPro">5. The Mind-Body Problem</h2>

<p>
The final part of Clauberg&rsquo;s <em>Physica</em> is the
<em>Corporis et animae in homine conjunctio</em>, one of the first
treatises dedicated to the problems of mind-body union and interaction
arising from Descartes&rsquo;s theory of substance. More so than in
general physics, it is in this context that Clauberg has been read as
an occasionalist (Bouillier 1868: 298; Windelband 1878: 300; Balz
1951; Viola 1975; Weier 1981). The occasionalist interpretation has
come under pressure in recent times, with scholars noting that
Clauberg affirms unambiguously only the negative thesis of
occasionalism&mdash;that mind and body do not interact&mdash;but not
its distinctive positive theses&mdash;that finite substances are
causally inert and that God is the only efficacious cause (Spruit
1999: 79; Bardout 2002: 135&ndash;8; Nadler 2011c: 122n). Accordingly,
some commentators have qualified Clauberg&rsquo;s occasionalism as
being limited to the body&rsquo;s communication with the mind, but
allowing the possibility of the mind influencing the body&rsquo;s
direction of motion (Schmaltz 2017: 176&ndash;81; Favaretti
Camposampiero 2018: 200&ndash;02). Others have proposed
anti-occasionalist readings, both two-way interactionist accounts of
the mind-body relation (Platt 2020: 137&ndash;65) and parallelist ones
on which true causation occurs within the mental and bodily realms but
not across the mind-body divide (Hamid 2022).</p>

<h3 id="Occ">5.1 Occasionalism</h3>

<p>
The principal grounds for attributing occasionalism about the
mind-body relation to Clauberg have to do, first, with his clear
denial that mind and body could be naturally united, and second, with
certain passages where he uses the Stoic and Galenic terms &ldquo;<em lang="la">occasio</em>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<em lang="la">causa
procatarctica</em>&rdquo; to describe the relation between mental and
bodily modes. In <em>Conjunctio</em> he rules out, on the basis of the
heterogeneous natures of mind and body, the possibility both of their
substantial unity and of their causal interaction. To underscore the
special character of the mind-body relation, he writes that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there cannot be found in the universe two things conjoined that are
more dissimilar and more generically different than body and soul.
(<em>Conj.</em> IV, OO I.211)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Denying that they are related as cause and effect, and that one is
required for the perfection or existence of the other, he concludes
that their union can only be ascribed to divine wisdom (<em>Conj.</em>
IV.14&ndash;5, OO I.212). Thus, Clauberg unequivocally affirms the
negative thesis of occasionalism about the mind-body relation, that
their radically distinct natures preclude any natural ground of their
union as well as of any genuine causation between them.</p>

<p>
Second, in an oft-discussed text, Clauberg describes bodily motions
as,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
merely <em>procatarctic</em> causes that give occasion [<em lang="la">occasionem
dant</em>] to the mind as the <em>principal</em>
cause, which indeed always has that power in itself, to produce such
and such an idea, at this particular moment, and to bring into act its
power of thinking. (<em>Conj</em>. XVI.10, OO I.221)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The picture suggested here seems to fit occasional causation,
according to which</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
one thing or state of affairs brings about an effect by inducing (but
not through efficient causation [&hellip;]) another thing to exercise
its own efficient causal power. (Nadler 2011b: 33)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, <em>A</em> occasions <em>B</em> to cause <em>e</em>, where
<em>e</em> is an effect of <em>B</em>&rsquo;s efficient causality.
Adopting this model, Clauberg might be read as holding that bodily
states are occasional causes of mental states by inducing the mind to
produce effects through its own efficient causality. Such a picture is
also suggested by certain passages where Clauberg calls the mind a
moral rather than physical cause, and likens the mind-body relation to
that between a charioteer and a horse: the charioteer directs the
motion of the horse, even as the motion is produced by the animal
itself (<em>Conj.</em> XVI.5&ndash;6, OO I.221).</p>

<p>
Against these reasons in favor of an occasionalist reading of
Clauberg, scholars have pointed to the absence in his texts of a clear
denial of causality to created substances, or of any general arguments
against secondary causation. That is, his denial of mind-body union or
interaction does not rest on the sorts of global arguments on which
Malebranche or La Forge, for instance, rest their occasionalist views,
such as the unintelligibility of necessary connections between finite
things, or the impossibility of the transfer of properties from one
substance to another. In light of this circumstance, Bardout (2002:
138) cautions against being misled by Clauberg&rsquo;s use of phrases
such as &ldquo;give occasion&rdquo; and &ldquo;procatarctic
cause&rdquo;, for such expressions are in principle reconcilable with
the efficacy of secondary causes.</p>

<h3 id="Int">5.2 Interactionism</h3>

<p>
Accordingly, some commentators have sought to clarify Clauberg&rsquo;s
positive account of the mind-body problem by turning to his general
theory of causation. Platt (2020: 137&ndash;65) attributes to Clauberg
a full-blown interactionist account of the mind-body relation. His
argument rests on the claim that Clauberg revised his theory of
efficient causation between the first and the later editions of his
ontology. Whereas in the first edition, he defined cause narrowly in
terms of production, in the 1660s he expanded his concept of efficient
causation in order to account for mind-body interaction. Specifically,
according to Platt, Clauberg came to recognize mere
dependence-relations as a special type of efficient causation, and
&ldquo;cause&rdquo; in general as synonymous with
&ldquo;principle&rdquo;. With this capacious view of efficient
causation as dependence, Clauberg could represent the regular
covariation of mental and bodily states, amply confirmed by
experience, as causal while denying that mind and body produce each
other&rsquo;s states by action.</p>

<p>
The key objection to Platt&rsquo;s view concerns his reading of
Clauberg&rsquo;s account of cause in <em>Metaphysica de ente</em>.
There, Clauberg defines &ldquo;cause&rdquo; as &ldquo;a principle that
gives being to another thing different from itself&rdquo; (<em lang="la">Causa
vero proprie dici videtur principium, quod alteri rei
essentiam largitur a sua diversam</em>; <em>Met. ente</em> XIII.225,
OO I.321). Cause is a species of principle, which he defines as
&ldquo;that from which something has its origin, or on which something
in any manner depends&rdquo; (<em>Met. ente</em> XIII.221, OO I.320).
For Clauberg, principle is the genus of dependence relations under
which he recognizes several species, including principles of knowing
(<em lang="la">cognoscendi</em>), principles of order (<em lang="la">ordinis</em>),
and principles of being (<em lang="la">essendi</em>).
Cause turns out to be a subspecies of <em lang="la">principium
essendi</em>, whose specific difference is that
it grounds a dependence relation by giving being (<em lang="la">essentiam
largitur</em>) to another thing. It thus appears
that, across all editions of his ontology, Clauberg defines causation
in terms of production, and does not collapse the category of cause
into principle.</p>

<p>
In light of this textual difficulty, a different anti-occasionalist
reading of Clauberg, due to Hamid (2022), takes at face value his
denial that mind and body are related as cause and effect, and argues
that he conceives their relation of conjunction as one of
signification rather than of causation. On this view, Clauberg
conceives mind and body as true efficient causes in their respective
domains, which by their own powers (together with God&rsquo;s primary
causality) produce two distinct series of effects. Their coordinated
effects, however, are not related causally but instead have the status
of mutually referring signs, whose meanings are arbitrarily
established by God&rsquo;s will. On this account, mental and bodily
states are only related semiotically. Crucially, this semiotic
relation is due to neither real interaction between finite substances
nor God&rsquo;s causal intervention to produce one on the occasion of
the other, but instead amounts to a special divine institution.</p>

<h3 id="ConMinBod">5.3 The Conjunction of Mind and Body</h3>

<p>
Common to recent discussions of Clauberg&rsquo;s account of the
mind-body problem is their attention to the special character of the
relation he calls &ldquo;conjunction&rdquo;. In a key passage, he
stresses that relations of causation and conjunction are subject to
different criteria, and that the former is not needed in order to
understand the mind-body relation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To establish the relation between these things [i.e., mind and body],
it is not at all necessary for one to be the cause or the effect of
the other. It suffices if one brings about something, or changes
something in the other, such that the two substances mutually refer to
each other in their actions and passions. (<em>Conj.</em> IX.10, OO
I.215)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Clauberg indicates that, unlike a causal relation, conjunction
can be established merely by reference. Whereas causal relations
require production, reference may obtain merely in virtue of
conventional marks standing in for certain arbitrary meanings.
Causation is certainly what grounds mental and bodily states, insofar
as mind and body count as true causes in their own domains. Yet,
Clauberg insists that the conjunction of mental and bodily modes is
not conceivable through their respective causal powers. Consequently,
he suggests that no deeper account of the mind-body relation is
possible apart from a description of the mutual reference of covarying
mental and bodily states. He continues by noting that, for all we
know, the mind-body relation consists only in an external
&ldquo;commerce and reciprocity&rdquo; (<em lang="la">commercio et
reciprocatione</em>) of their actions and passions, not in
&ldquo;similitude and agreement&rdquo; (<em lang="la">similitudine et
convenientia</em>) of their powers (<em>Conj.</em> IX.11, OO I.215).
And he reminds the reader that, by contrast, a real union of mind and
body would require causal production, or that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
something should come from this to that, or from that to this, that
is, that one should give something to the other, or it should receive
something from the other. (<em>Conj.</em> IX.13, OO I.215)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Their mere conjunction, however, requires only the mutual reference of
their actions.</p>

<p>
In fact, Clauberg takes the union of mind and body, which constitutes
the human being, to consist in nothing more than such a conjunction of
mental and bodily modes. In <em>Theoria corporum viventium</em>, he
rejects the Aristotelian formula of man as a rational animal, instead
defining &ldquo;<em lang="la">homo</em>&rdquo; simply as &ldquo;a
thing composed from a finite mind and an organic body&rdquo;
(<em>Corp. viv.</em> XXIV.588&ndash;9, OO I.187). The human being is
neither a hylomorphic unity nor a distinct, simple nature, but a
composite of two complete, separate substances. The unity of mind and
body is thus only an external one, consisting in the correlation of
their modes (<em>Conj.</em> IV.14, OO I.212). Accordingly, his favored
metaphors for mind-body union invoke contingent cooperation, such as
teaching (<em lang="la">docens</em>), federation (<em lang="la">foedere</em>),
and friendship (<em lang="la">amicitia</em>),
rather than essential unity (<em>Conj.</em> VIII.4, OO I.214; IX.17,
OO I.216; <em>Corp. viv.</em>, XXVI.613, OO I.188).</p>

<p>
Concerning the origin of the mind-body union, then, Clauberg cautions
against seeking a causal account:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is not appropriate to ask why such-and-such thoughts of the soul
follow such-and-such motions of the body, or to seek how the motions
of the animal spirits depend on the will. No natural necessity or
affinity will be found inherent in these acts. (<em>Conj.</em> XIV.8,
OO I.219)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nothing in mental and corporeal natures explains the correlations of
their states, which seem to be arbitrary: why, for instance, certain
patterns of brain motions following a stubbed toe are regularly
accompanied by pain sensations and the desire to withdraw the foot.
For Clauberg, all we are in a position to say is that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
through his wisdom and freedom, God has willed that these acts of such
different kinds be united in a human being, such that the one refers
to the other, without there being any similitude between them.
(<em>Conj.</em> XIV.9, OO I.219)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God&rsquo;s will has made it the case that certain mental actions
refer to certain bodily actions, and vice versa. But no deeper
explanation of this fact could be forthcoming.</p>

<p>
As for the referential character of sensations, Clauberg regards it as
analogous to signification relations in language (<em>Conj.</em> XV.2,
OO I.220). He calls sensations material or instrumental signs (<em lang="la">signa
materialia/instrumentalia</em>) as opposed to formal
signs (<em lang="la">signa formalia</em>). A formal sign is &ldquo;an
image of a thing in the mind, or every sign which properly speaking
represents&rdquo; (<em>Met. ente</em>, XXI.336, OO I.337). A formal
sign represents an object by denoting its essential features, as smoke
represents fire in virtue of acquainting the perceiver with qualities
that necessarily result from burning. A material sign, by contrast,
has a merely indicative function, and serves as an external aid to
thinking. Deploying the distinction in <em>Conjunctio</em>, Clauberg
likens the significatory character of sensations to the way in which
&ldquo;ivy hanging [on the tavern door] announces that wine is for
sale&rdquo; (<em>Conj.</em>, XXXVIII.14, OO I.243). Ivy on the tavern
door does not naturally represent the availability of good wine, and
yet reliably informs customers in virtue of a social convention.
Analogously, pain sensations do not represent the bodily causes of
pain, and yet reliably indicate a certain kind of bodily state.
Indeed, for Clauberg, we may be confident that the meanings of
sensations, being divinely instituted, are more stable than socially
instituted meanings. But whatever special reasons may have led God to
decree that certain brain patterns should signify pain and others
should signify hunger remain inexplicable. From the human standpoint,
understanding the mind-body union becomes a matter of describing the
covariations of sensations and bodily states, not of discovering
causality.</p>
