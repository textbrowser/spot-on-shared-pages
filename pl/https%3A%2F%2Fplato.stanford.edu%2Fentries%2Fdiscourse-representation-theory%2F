<h1>Discourse Representation Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 22, 2007; substantive revision Thu Jul 11, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
In the early 1980s, Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was
introduced by Hans Kamp as a theoretical framework for dealing with
issues in the semantics and pragmatics of anaphora and tense (Kamp
1981a); a very similar theory was developed independently by Irene
Heim (1982). The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below,
are that it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of
interpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only
of individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects
DRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during
the 1970s had emanated from Montague&rsquo;s pioneering work (Montague
1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its
use of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve
as a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, and given
rise to numerous extensions, modifications, applications and
implementations. We will confine our attention to topics related to
philosophical debates, ignoring applications related more to
linguistics, logic, or AI.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
This article concerns Discourse Representation Theory narrowly defined
as work in the tradition descending from Kamp (1981a). The same term
is sometimes used more broadly, occasionally embracing Heim&rsquo;s
(1982) work and the developments initiated by Groenendijk and Stokhof
(1990, 1991). However, the more common common label for the extended
DRT family is &ldquo;dynamic semantics&rdquo;, and that is the term we
will use, too.</p>

<p>
Two features that set DRT apart from other varieties of dynamic
semantics is that it is representational and non-compositional. In the
1980s, the founding years of dynamic semantics, these features made
DRT a controversial theory, though by now those controversies have
abated. DRT&rsquo;s main innovation, beyond the Montagovian paradigm
which was then considered orthodox, is that it introduced a level of
mental representations, called &ldquo;discourse representation
structures&rdquo; (DRSs). The basic idea is rather straightforward. It
is that a hearer builds up a mental representation of the discourse as
it unfolds, and that every incoming sentence prompts additions to that
representation. This picture has always been commonplace in the
psychology of language. DRT&rsquo;s principal tenet is that it should
be the starting point for semantic theory, too.</p>

<p>
A theory of the DRT family consists of the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>

<li>A formal definition of the representation language, consisting of:

<ul>

<li>a recursive definition of the set of all well-formed DRSs,
and</li>

<li>a model-theoretic semantics for the members of this set;</li>
</ul> </li>

<li>a construction procedure, which specifies how to extend a given
DRS when a sentence comes in.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Technically, this is very similar to earlier work in formal semantics,
with two exceptions: the interpretation process always takes the
previous discourse into account, and the level of semantic
representations is claimed to be essential. What has worried some
semanticists is not so much the fact that DRSs are mental
representations, but that an additional level is needed, and used in
ways that render the theory non-compositional; we will return to this
issue in
 <a href="#ReprComp">Section 7</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="DonkPron">2. Donkey pronouns</h2>

<p>
The relationship between a pronoun and its antecedent is one that has
received a great deal of attention in linguistics and philosophy. We
say that a pronoun is anaphoric, as opposed to deictic, for example,
if it depends for its interpretation on an antecedent expression
elsewhere in the sentence or the discourse. In some cases the nature
of this dependency seems straightforward:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex2_1">[1]</dt>
<dd><u>Pedro</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(Here and henceforth we use underlining to highlight the anaphoric
links we are currently interested in.) Since &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo; is a
referential expression, it makes sense, in this case, to say that
&ldquo;his&rdquo; is a referential term, too, which derives its
reference from its antecedent. This construal is plausible enough, but
it doesn&rsquo;t apply across the board:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex2_2">[2]</dt>
<dd><u>No farmer</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The term &ldquo;no farmer&rdquo; is not a referential expression, so
&ldquo;his&rdquo; cannot be coreferential with it. Rather, it would
seem that, in this case, the relationship between the pronoun and its
antecedent is one of <strong>binding</strong>, in the logical sense of
the word: &ldquo;no farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; are
interpreted as a quantifier and a variable, respectively, and the
former binds the latter.</p>

<p>
It is fairly obvious that the bound-variable construal of pronouns is
subject to syntactic constraints. Most importantly, this type of
interpretation requires that the pronoun be
<strong>c-commanded</strong> by its antecedent, where c-command is
defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>A</em> c-commands <em>B</em> iff <em>B</em> is, or is contained
in, a sister constituent of <em>A</em>&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The constituent structure of sentence
 <a href="#ex2_2">[2]</a>
 is [<sub>S</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> No farmer][<sub>VP</sub> beat
[<sub>NP</sub> his donkey]]]. Here the pronoun is contained in the
sister of its antecedent, so the c-command constraint is met. In
 <a href="#ex2_3">[3]</a>
 &ldquo;no farmer&rdquo; does not c-command &ldquo;his&rdquo;, and so
we predict, correctly, that the pronoun cannot be bound.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex2_3">[3]</dt>
<dd><u>His</u> donkey likes <u>no farmer</u>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Since the syntactic structure of
 <a href="#ex2_1">[1]</a>
 is identical to that of
 <a href="#ex2_2">[2]</a>,
 we might wonder if the pronoun in [1] may not be bound by its
antecedent, just as in [2]. If this were possible, there would be two
ways of construing the pronoun in [1]: it could function either as a
referential term or as a bound variable. There is evidence that this
is indeed the case:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex2_4a">[4a]</dt>
<dd><u>Pedro</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey, and Juan does, too.</dd>
<dt id="ex2_4b">[4b]</dt>
<dd><u>Every farmer</u> beats <u>his</u> donkey, and Juan does,
too.</dd>
</dl>

<p>

 <a href="#ex2_4a">[4a]</a>
 is ambiguous in a way
 <a href="#ex2_4b">[4b]</a>
 is not. Its second conjunct can be construed as saying either that
Juan beats his own donkey or that Juan beats Pedro&rsquo;s donkey. The
second conjunct of [4b], by contrast, can only be interpreted as
saying that Juan beats his own donkey. If the possessive pronoun in
the first conjunct of [4a] can be either referential or a bound
variable, the contrast is readily explained.</p>

<p>
In large part, the motivation for developing dynamic theories of
interpretation, beginning with DRT, was the realization that the
dichotomy between referential and bound-variable (occurrences of)
pronouns is less natural than one might think&mdash;less natural in
the sense that some pronouns don&rsquo;t fit comfortably in either
category.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex2_5">
<dt id="ex2_5a">[5a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro owns <u>a donkey</u>.</dd>
<dt id="ex2_5b">[5b]</dt>
<dd><u>It</u> is grey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
What is the relationship between &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the second
sentence and its antecedent expression in the first? On the one hand,
it cannot be coreference. If the pronoun were coreferential with its
antecedent, the indefinite &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; would have to be a
referential term, which seems unlikely, e.g., because the negation of
 <a href="#ex2_5a">[5a]</a>
 says not that there is a donkey that Pedro fails to own, but rather
that he doesn&rsquo;t own any donkey, and furthermore, if [5a] is
negated, the anaphoric link between the pronoun and its antecedent is
severed:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex2_6a">[6a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro doesn&rsquo;t own <u>a donkey</u>.</dd>
<dt id="ex2_6b">[6b]</dt>
<dd>*<u>It</u> is grey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(The asterisk indicates that the sentence is infelicitous if &ldquo;a
donkey&rdquo; is to be interpreted as the antecedent of
&ldquo;it&rdquo;.) Observations like these suggest rather strongly
that indefinites are quantifiers rather than referential terms.
However, if we construe &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; as an existential
quantifier, how does it manage to bind the pronoun across a sentence
boundary?</p>

<p>
The problem with
 <a href="#ex2_5">[5]</a>
 is related to the fact that the pronoun and its indefinite antecedent
occur in different sentences. The following examples show, however,
that similar problems arise within sentences:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex2_7">
<dt id="ex2_7a">[7a]</dt>
<dd>If Pedro owns <u>a donkey</u>, he beats <u>it</u>.</dd>
<dt id="ex2_7b">[7b]</dt>
<dd>Every farmer who owns <u>a donkey</u> beats <u>it</u>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These are the infamous &ldquo;donkey sentences&rdquo; that were
already discussed by scholastic philosophers, and in modern times were
reintroduced into philosophy by Geach (1962). In these cases it is
obvious that the pronouns don&rsquo;t refer, so they can&rsquo;t be
coreferential with their antecedents, either. Nor are the pronouns
bound by their antecedents, for they aren&rsquo;t c-commanded by them.
The constituent structure of
 <a href="#ex2_7b">[7b]</a>
 is roughly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[<sub>S</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> Every [<sub>N</sub> farmer who owns
[<sub>NP</sub> a donkey]]] [<sub>VP</sub> beats it]]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whatever the syntactical details, &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; is too deeply
embedded for it to c-command &ldquo;it&rdquo;. The same goes for
 <a href="#ex2_7a">[7a]</a>.
 Hence, the neuter pronouns in
 <a href="#ex2_7">[7a,b]</a>
 cannot be construed as bound variables.</p>

<p>
Another way of showing that donkey pronouns are problematic is by
considering how we might render these sentences in predicate logic.
The most obvious interpretation of
 <a href="#ex2_7a">[7a]</a>
 is that Pedro beats every donkey he owns, and
 <a href="#ex2_7b">[7b]</a>
 is naturally interpreted as claiming that every farmer beats every
donkey he owns. (So, somewhat surprisingly, it appears that the
indefinites in these sentences have universal force.) These readings
may be captured as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex2_9">
<dt id="ex2_9a">[9a]</dt>
<dd>\(\forall x[[\textrm{donkey}(x) \amp
\textrm{own}(\textrm{Pedro},x)] \rightarrow
\textrm{beat}(\textrm{Pedro},x)]\)</dd>
<dt id="ex2_9b">[9b]</dt>
<dd>\(\forall x \forall y[[\textrm{farmer}(x) \amp \textrm{donkey}(y)
\amp \textrm{own}(x,y)] \rightarrow \textrm{beat}(x,y)]\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So the problem is not that predicate logic fails to capture the
meanings of
 <a href="#ex2_7a">[7a]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex2_7b">[7b]</a>.
 The problem is, rather, how to derive
 <a href="#ex2_9a">[9a]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex2_9b">[9b]</a>
 from [7a] and [7b] in a principled way. In order to derive these
logical forms, we have to assume not only that an indefinite
expression buried in a subordinate position ends up having wide scope,
but also that it acquires universal force in the process. A theory
based on such assumptions might capture the facts, but it would be
clearly ad hoc, and would generate a host of false predictions, as
well.</p>

<p>
The upshot of the foregoing observations is that, apparently,
indefinites are neither quantifiers nor referential terms, and this
problem entrains another one, for as long as it is unclear what
indefinites mean, it will also remain obscure how they can serve as
antecedents to pronouns. Later on we will see that very similar
problems arise in seemingly disparate domains, like the interpretation
of tense and presuppositions.</p>

<h2 id="BasiDRT">3. Basic DRT</h2>

<p>
This section introduces DRT in fairly informal terms. We show how a
hearer builds up a mental model of the ongoing discourse, dealing not
only with simple sentences, but also with conditionals,
quantification, and anaphora, and we discuss DRT&rsquo;s treatment of
indefinites, and how they are set apart from quantifying
expressions.</p>

<h3 id="KeyIdea">3.1 The key ideas</h3>

<p>
A discourse representation structure (DRS) is a mental representation
built up by the hearer as the discourse unfolds. A DRS consists of two
parts: a universe of so-called &ldquo;discourse referents&rdquo;,
which represent the objects under discussion, and a set of
DRS-conditions which encode the information that has accumulated on
these discourse referents. The following DRS represents the
information that there are two individuals, one of which is a farmer,
the other a donkey, and that the former chased the latter:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_1">[1]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{x},\R{y}:
\textrm{farmer}(\R{x}),\textrm{donkey}(\R{y}),\textrm{chased}(\R{x},\R{y})]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The universe of this DRS contains two discourse referents,
\(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{y}},\) and its condition set is
\(\{\cb{\textrm{farmer}(\R{x}), \textrm{donkey}(\R{y}),
\textrm{chased}(\R{x},\R{y})}\}.\)</p>

<p>
A DRS like the one in
 <a href="#ex3_1">[1]</a>
 can be given a straightforward model-theoretic interpretation. In DRT
this is done by means of <strong>embedding functions</strong>, which
are partial functions from discourse referents to individuals in a
given model \(M\); or put otherwise, an embedding function is a
partial variable assignment. An embedding function \(f\)
<strong>verifies</strong> [1] in \(M\) iff the domain of \(f\)
includes at least \(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{y}}\), and according to
\(M\) it is the case that \(f(\cb{\R{x}})\) is a farmer,
\(f(\cb{\R{y}})\) is a donkey, and \(f(\cb{\R{x}})\) chased
\(f(\cb{\R{y}}).\)</p>

<p>
Meanwhile it will have become clear that the DRS in [1] is designed to
reflect the intuitive meaning of:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_2">[2]</dt>
<dd>A farmer chased a donkey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Indeed, it is claimed that, in the absence of any information about
the context in which this sentence is uttered,
 <a href="#ex3_1">[1]</a>
 is the semantic representation of
 <a href="#ex3_2">[2]</a>.
 So the indefinite expressions &ldquo;a farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;a
donkey&rdquo; prompt the introduction of two new discourse referents,
\(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{y}}\), and contribute the information that
\(\cb{\R{x}}\) is a farmer and \(\cb{\R{y}}\) a donkey, while the verb
contributes the information that the former chased the latter.</p>

<p>
If a discourse begins with an utterance of
 <a href="#ex3_2">[2]</a>,
 the DRS in
 <a href="#ex3_1">[1]</a>
 is constructed, and this DRS forms the background against which the
next utterance is interpreted. Suppose now that [2] is followed by a
token of
 <a href="#ex3_3a">[3a]</a>:</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_3a">[3a]</dt>
<dd>He caught it.</dd>
<dt id="ex3_3b">[3b]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\ulR{v}, \ulR{w}: \textrm{caught}(\R{v},\R{w})]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>

 <a href="#ex3_3b">[3b]</a>
 is the DRS that reflects the semantic content of
 <a href="#ex3_3a">[3a]</a>
 before the pronouns are resolved. In this DRS, the anaphoric pronouns
&ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rdquo; in [3a] are represented by the
discourse referents \(\cb{\R{v}}\) and \(\cb{\R{w}},\) respectively.
These discourse referents are underlined to indicate that they require
an antecedent. Since [3a] is uttered in the context of
 <a href="#ex3_1">[1]</a>,
 the next step in the interpretation of this sentence is to merge the
DRS in [3b] with that in [1]. The result of this merging operation is
 <a href="#ex3_4a">[4a]</a>:</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_4a">[4a]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{x}, \R{y}, \ulR{v}, \ulR{w}: \textrm{farmer}(\R{x}),
\textrm{donkey}(\R{y}), \textrm{chased}(\R{x},\R{y}),
\textrm{caught}(\R{v},\R{w})]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Since
 <a href="#ex3_3a">[3a]</a>
 is immediately preceded by
 <a href="#ex3_2">[2]</a>,
 the antecedent of &ldquo;he&rdquo; is probably (though not
necessarily) &ldquo;a farmer&rdquo;, while &ldquo;it&rdquo; is
anaphorically dependent on &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo;. At the DRS level,
this is represented by equating the discourse referents \(\cb{\R{v}}\)
and \(\cb{\R{w}}\) with \(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{y}}\),
respectively. These operations yield
 <a href="#ex3_4b">[4b]</a>,
 which is equivalent to
 <a href="#ex3_4c">[4c]</a>.
 Either DRS is verified in a model \(M\) iff \(M\) features a farmer
who chased and caught a donkey.</p>

Thus far, we have only considered DRSs with simple conditions, but in
order to account for negated and conditional sentences, say, complex
conditions are required.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_5a">[5a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro doesn&rsquo;t have a donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex3_5b">[5b]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[_{1} \R{x}: \textrm{Pedro}(\R{x}), \neg [_{2} \R{y}:
\textrm{donkey}(\R{y}), \textrm{owns}(\R{x},\R{y})] ]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>

 <a href="#ex3_5b">[5b]</a>
 is the sentence DRS corresponding to
 <a href="#ex3_5a">[5a]</a>.
 This DRS contains a condition that consists of a DRS prefixed by a
negation sign. For ease of reference we will sometimes adorn DRSs with
numerical labels, as we have done in [5b], and use these in names like
&ldquo;[5b<sub>1</sub>]&rdquo;, &ldquo;[5b<sub>2</sub>]&rdquo;, and so
on. In general, labeling of DRSs will be top-down and left-to-right,
so the main (or principal) DRS will always be number one.</p>

<p>
A function \(f\) verifies [5b<sub>1</sub>] in a model \(M\) iff \(f\)
maps \(\cb{\R{x}}\) onto an individual in \(M\) which &ldquo;is a
Pedro&rdquo;, i.e., which is called &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo;, and \(f\)
cannot be extended to a function <em>g</em> which verifies
[5b<sub>2</sub>]. That is to say, no such <em>g</em> should map
\(\cb{\R{y}}\) onto a donkey that Pedro owns.</p>

<p>
[5b<sub>2</sub>] contains a token of the discourse referent
\(\cb{\R{x}}\) which is introduced externally, in the DRS in which
[5b<sub>2</sub>] is embedded, i.e., [5b<sub>1</sub>]. Apart from that,
[5b<sub>2</sub>] also introduces a discourse referent of its own,
i.e., \(\cb{\R{y}}\), which is associated with the indefinite NP
&ldquo;a donkey&rdquo;, and whose scope is delimited by
[5b<sub>2</sub>]. Consequently, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to refer
to \(\cb{\R{y}}\) outside of [5b<sub>2</sub>]. In DRT, this is taken
to explain why the &ldquo;lifespan&rdquo; of the individual introduced
by the indefinite NP in [5a] is delimited by the scope of the negation
operator. If
 <a href="#ex3_5a">[5a]</a>
 were followed by
 <a href="#ex3_6a">[6a]</a>,
 for example, the pronoun could not be linked to the indefinite:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_6a">[6a]</dt>
<dd>It is grey.</dd>
<dt id="ex3_6b">[6b]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\ulR{z}: \textrm{grey}(\R{z})]}\)</dd>
<dt id="ex3_6c">[6c]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[_{1} \R{x}, \ulR{z}: \textrm{Pedro}(\R{x}), \neg [_{2}
\R{y}:\textrm{donkey}(\R{y}), \textrm{owns}(\R{x},\R{y})],
\textrm{grey}(\R{z})]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If we merge
 <a href="#ex3_5b">[5b]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex3_6b">[6b]</a>,
 which is the sentence DRS corresponding with
 <a href="#ex3_6a">[6a]</a>,
 we obtain
 <a href="#ex3_6c">[6c]</a>.
 In this representation, the discourse referent \(\cb{\R{z}}\) does
not have access to \(\cb{\R{y}}\), because \(\cb{\R{y}}\) is
introduced in a DRS that is not accessible to the DRS in which
\(\cb{\R{z}}\) is introduced, and therefore it is not possible to bind
\(\cb{\R{z}}\) to \(\cb{\R{y}}\). In other words, if [6a] is preceded
by
 <a href="#ex3_5a">[5a]</a>,
 the pronoun cannot be anaphorically linked to the indefinite. This
prediction appears to be correct.</p>

<p>
Accessibility is in the first instance a relation between DRSs;
derivatively, it is also a relation between discourse referents.
[6c<sub>1</sub>] is accessible to [6c<sub>2</sub>], but not the other
way round, and therefore the discourse referents introduced in
[6c<sub>1</sub>], i.e., \(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{z}}\), are
accessible from [6c<sub>2</sub>], but conversely, if we are in
[6c<sub>1</sub>] we have no access to [6c<sub>2</sub>] and its
discourse referents, i.e., \(\cb{\R{y}}\). Thus in
 <a href="#ex3_6c">[6c]</a>
 anaphora is not possible because \(\cb{\R{y}}\) is not accessible to
\(\cb{\R{z}}\). In
 <a href="#ex3_4a">[4a]</a>,
 by contrast, anaphora is possible, because \(\cb{\R{x}}\) and
\(\cb{\R{y}}\) are accessible to \(\cb{\R{v}}\) and \(\cb{\R{w}}\)
(the accessibility relation being reflexive). The notion of
accessibility is crucial to DRT&rsquo;s account of anaphora, and it is
important to note that it is not stipulated, but is entailed by the
semantics of the DRS language. [6c<sub>1</sub>] is accessible to
[6c<sub>2</sub>] because every embedding function that must be
considered for [6c<sub>2</sub>] is an extension of an embedding
function for [6c<sub>1</sub>], and it is for this reason that every
discourse referent in [6c<sub>1</sub>] is also defined in
[6c<sub>2</sub>]. The converse, however, does not hold.</p>

<p>
Like negated sentences, conditionals give rise to complex
DRS-conditions, too.
 <a href="#ex3_7">[7]</a>
 gives an example:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex3_7">
<dt id="ex3_7a">[7a]</dt>

</dl>

<p>

 <a href="#ex3_7b">[7b]</a>
 is the sentence DRS which corresponds to
 <a href="#ex3_7a">[7a]</a>,
 and assuming for convenience that this sentence is uttered in an
empty context, it is also the initial DRS of the discourse. The
complex condition in this structure is interpreted as follows: if
\(f\) is to verify [7b<sub>1</sub>] in the current model, then
\(f(\cb{\R{x}})\) must be an individual called &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo;,
and every extension of \(f\) which verifies [7b<sub>2</sub>] must
itself be extendable to a function that verifies [7b<sub>3</sub>]. It
follows from this that [7b<sub>1</sub>] is accessible to
[7b<sub>2</sub>], which in its turn is accessible to [7b<sub>3</sub>],
and therefore \(\cb{\R{v}}\) may be linked up to \(\cb{\R{x}}\)
(accessibility being a transitive relation) and \(\cb{\R{w}}\) to
\(\cb{\R{y}}\). The result is
 <a href="#ex3_7c">[7c]</a>,
 which is equivalent to
 <a href="#ex3_7d">[7d]</a>,
 both DRSs saying that Pedro beats every donkey he owns.</p>

<p>
The interpretation of quantified donkey sentences is very similar to
what we have just seen:</p>

\textrm{beats}(\R{v},\R{w})] ])\end{multline}}\)</dd> pdf include-->
</dl>

<p>
There are two ways of spelling out the interpretation of so-called
<strong>duplex conditions</strong> of the form \(K(\cb{\forall} x)
K'.\) On its weak interpretation,
 <a href="#ex3_8a">[8a]</a>
 means that every farmer who owns a donkey beats at least one of the
donkeys he owns; on its strong interpretation the sentence says that
every farmer beats every donkey he owns. While the strong reading is
the most natural choice for [8a], other donkey sentences prefer a weak
reading:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_9">[9]</dt>
<dd>Every farmer who owns a tractor uses it to drive to church on
Sundays.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The most likely interpretation for
 <a href="#ex3_9">[9]</a>
 to have is that every tractor-owning farmer uses one of their
tractors to drive to church.</p>

<p>
The distinction between weak and strong interpretations is somewhat
mysterious, because it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an ordinary ambiguity.
For example, donkey sentences with existential quantifiers don&rsquo;t
seem to license strong readings:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex3_10">[10]</dt>
<dd>Some farmers who own a donkey beat it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This can only be construed as saying that some donkey-owning farmers
beat at least one of their donkeys. More generally, the universally
quantified donkey sentences seem to be the only ones to license both
interpretations. It is not entirely clear why this should be the case
(see Kanazawa 1994; Geurts 2002).</p>

<p>
Whether weak or strong, the interpretation of a condition of the form
\(K(Qx)K',\) where \(Q\) may be any quantifier, makes \(K\) accessible
to \(K',\) and in this respect (which is the fulcrum of the DRT
analysis) conditionals and quantified sentences are the same.
Consequently, the discourse referents \(\cb{\R{x}}\) and
\(\cb{\R{y}}\) in [8b<sub>2</sub>] are accessible to \(\cb{\R{v}}\)
and \(\cb{\R{w}}\) in [8b<sub>3</sub>], and the latter may be equated
to the former. The resulting representation is
 <a href="#ex3_8c">[8c]</a>,
 which is equivalent to
 <a href="#ex3_8d">[8d]</a>.</p>

<p>
The DRT analysis of quantified expressions like &ldquo;all&rdquo; or
&ldquo;most&rdquo; is fairly standard. A quantifier binds a variable
and delivers the truth conditions one should expect. Indefinites are
different. An indefinite like &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; is treated not as
a quantifier but simply as device for introducing a discourse referent
and one or more conditions; on the DRT account, indefinites have no
quantifying force of their own. What quantifying force they seem to
have is not theirs, but derives from the environment in which they
occur. If the semantic material associated with &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo;
is introduced in the main DRS, as in
 <a href="#ex3_4c">[4c]</a>,
 the quantifying effect will be existential, owing to the fact that
this DRS is verified in a model \(M\) iff <strong>there is</strong> a
way of verifying it in \(M\). If the semantic material associated with
&ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; is introduced in the antecedent of a
conditional, as in
 <a href="#ex3_7d">[7d]</a>,
 the quantifying effect will be universal, owing to the fact that a
condition of the form \(K\cb{\Rightarrow} K'\) is verified in \(M\)
iff <strong>every</strong> way of verifying \(K\) can be extended to a
way of verifying \(K'.\) This view on indefinites lies at the heart of
DRT.</p>

<p>
DRT was one of the first semantic theories to go beyond the sentence
boundary, and take into account how the interpretation of an
expression may depend on the preceding discourse. Looking back at the
examples discussed in the foregoing, we see that, if the DRT approach
is on the right track, sentence boundaries are not as important as the
Fregean (or Chomskyan) conception of language would have it. In
particular, there is essentially no difference between the DRT
analysis of cross-sentential anaphora, as exemplified by the
mini-discourse
 <a href="#ex3_2">[2]</a>&ndash;<a href="#ex3_3a">[3a]</a>,
 and sentence-internal anaphora, as in
 <a href="#ex3_7a">[7a]</a>
 or
 <a href="#ex2_9a">[9a]</a>.
 In either case, the pronoun simply serves to pick up an accessible
discourse referent. This raises the question of how DRT&rsquo;s
new-fangled notion of anaphora relates to the dichotomy between
referential and bound-variable pronouns. Curiously, this issue
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have received much attention yet.</p>

<h3 id="OneVsTwoLeveVersDRT">3.3 One- vs. two-level versions of DRT</h3>

<p>
In the foregoing we assumed that the contribution of a sentence to the
discourse, as represented by a DRS, was obtained in two steps. In the
first one, a sentence DRS was constructed in a compositional way; this
part of the construction process we took for granted, but its
implementation wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult. In the second step,
the sentence DRS was merged with the DRS representing the prior
discourse, and anaphoric references were resolved. This two-stage
procedure has become the industrial standard, but the original version
of DRT (Kamp 1981a; Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993) was monostratal in the
sense that one set of rules took care of both tasks at once. In the
meantime, Kamp and his co-workers have adopted the two-step method,
too (e.g., Kamp, van Genabith, &amp; Reyle 2011).</p>

<p>
In one-level versions of DRT, a single set of rules is used to obtain
the semantic contribution of a sentence. To take a simple example, if
the sentence is &ldquo;It is grey&rdquo;, the first rule to apply will
say that the semantic correlate of the subject is an argument to the
predicate expressed by &ldquo;is grey&rdquo;. Then the two main parts
of the sentence are analysed further, and the pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo;
triggers a rule which at once deals with the pronoun&rsquo;s lexical
content and its context dependence; i.e., it says that we must select
a new discourse referent, link it to a discourse referent made
available by the preceding discourse, and update the DRS so as to
record these changes. In two-level versions of DRT there is no such
rule. Its duties are divided between two separate mechanisms. In the
first stage, a separate DRS is constructed for the sentence, in which
pronouns prompt the introduction of new discourse referents that are
marked as being anaphoric (we use underlining for this purpose). In
the second stage, there is a general mechanism for dealing with
discourse referents thus marked.</p>

<p>
The distinction between one- and two-level versions of DRT is of
interest for at least two reasons. First, once we go beyond basic DRT,
the two-stage system may actually be more economical overall. For
example, if DRT is extended for dealing with presuppositions (see
 <a href="#ApplExte">Section 5</a>),
 the one-pass approach becomes unwieldy. Secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, two-stage theories may be viewed as implementing a
distinction between semantics and pragmatics which has some prima
facie plausibility: in the first stage a representation is computed
which is projected from the sentence&rsquo;s lexico-grammatical
structure, while in the second stage, context-dependent aspects of
meaning are dealt with. This division of labor is reminiscent of the
traditional dichotomy between compositional semantics and
non-compositional pragmatics, but it should be noted that the two do
not coincide. Usually, the &ldquo;semantical&rdquo; part of a
two-stage version of DRT is not compositional in the Fregean sense,
because its output is essentially incomplete; it may contain anaphoric
&ldquo;gaps&rdquo;, for example. Therefore, even if a sentence DRS
admits of a truth-conditional interpretation, it will typically fall
short of capturing everything that is conventionally thought to belong
to truth-conditional content.</p>

<h2 id="DRSLangSyntSemaAcce">4. The DRS language: syntax, semantics, accessibility</h2>

<p>
In this section we give a more precise description of the DRS language
than we have done so far. We define the syntax of the language,
present a model-theoretic interpretation, and discuss the notion of
accessibility, which figures so prominently in DRT&rsquo;s account of
anaphora.</p>

<h3 id="Synt">4.1 Syntax</h3>

<p>
DRSs are set-theoretic objects built from <strong>discourse
referents</strong> and <strong>DRS-conditions</strong>. A
DRS-condition is either atomic, in which case it consists of a
predicate and a suitable number of discourse referents, or complex, in
which case it embeds one or two DRSs. Hence, the definition of the DRS
language is by simultaneous recursion:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>DRSs and DRS-conditions</strong></dt>
<dd>

<ul style="padding-left: 0pt;margin-top:0">

<li>A DRS \(K\) is a pair \(\langle U_K, \textit{Con}_K\rangle\),
where \(U_K\) is a set of discourse referents, and \(\textit{Con}_K\)
is a set of DRS-conditions.</li>

<li>If \(P\) is an n-place predicate, and \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\) are
discourse referents, then \(P(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\) is a
DRS-condition.</li>

<li>If \(x\) and \(y\) are discourse referents, then \(x \cb{=} y\) is
a DRS-condition.</li>

<li>If \(K\) and \(K'\) are DRSs, then \(\cb{\neg} K,\) \(K
\cb{\Rightarrow} K',\) and \(K \cb{\lor } K'\) are
DRS-conditions.</li>

<li>If \(K\) and \(K'\) are DRSs and \(x\) is a discourse referent,
then \(K(\cb{\forall} x K'\) is a DRS-condition.</li>
</ul> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note that there are no conditions corresponding to conjoined
sentences. Such sentences are dealt with, rather, by merging the DRSs
associated with their parts, where the merge of two DRSs \(K\) and
\(K'\) is defined as their pointwise union:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>DRS-merge</strong></dt>
<dd>

<ul style="padding-left:0;margin-top:0">

<li>\(K\oplus K' = \langle U_{K} \cup U_{K'}, \textit{Con}_{K} \cup
\textit{Con}_{K'}\rangle\)</li>
</ul> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The merge operation is also used for combining a sentence DRS with the
DRS representing the preceding discourse, so the idea is that there is
no principled distinction between (clausal) conjunction and sentence
concatenation (see Muskens 1996 for discussion).</p>

<p>
Officially, DRSs are set-theoretical objects, but in this article we
use a linear notation. Many sources, including Kamp&rsquo;s own work,
employ a graphical &ldquo;box notation&rdquo; which is sometimes
clearer, but less parsimonious and more difficult to type. To
illustrate the various schemes, here are three ways of representing
the content of a conditional donkey sentence:</p>

<h3 id="Acce">4.2 Accessibility</h3>

<p>
Accessibility is a relation between DRSs that is transitive and
reflexive, i.e., it is a preorder. More in particular, it is the
smallest preorder for which the following holds, for all DRSs \(K\),
\(K'\), and \(K'\): if \(\textit{Con}_{K}\) contains a condition of
the form &hellip;</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\cb{\neg} K',\) then \(K\) is accessible to \(K'\)</li>

<li>\(K'\cb{\lor} K',\) then \(K\) is accessible to \(K'\) and
\(K'\)</li>

<li>\(K' \cb{\rightarrow} K'\), then \(K\) is accessible to \(K'\) and
\(K'\) is accessible to \(K'\)</li>

<li>\(K'(\cb{\forall} x)K'\), then \(K\) is accessible to \(K'\) and
\(K'\) is accessible to \(K'\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To illustrate, in the following schematic representations, every DRS
is accessible to all and only those DRSs whose number doesn&rsquo;t
precede its own (so every DRS is accessible to itself):</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\cb{[_{1} \ldots [_{2} \ldots ](\forall x)[_{3} \ldots \neg
[_{4} \ldots ] ] ]}\)</li>

<li>\(\cb{[_{1} \ldots [_{2} \ldots ] \rightarrow [_{3} \ldots \neg
[_{4} \ldots ] ] ]}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <strong>accessible domain</strong> of a DRS \(K,\) \(A_{K},\) is
the set of discourse referents that occur in some \(K'\) that is
accessible to \(K\), i.e., \(A_{K} = \{x : K'\) is accessible to \(K\)
and \(x \in U_{K'}\}.\) The main constraint which DRT imposes on the
interpretation of anaphora is this:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Accessibility constraint</strong></dt>
<dd>A pronoun is represented by a discourse referent \(x\) which must
be equated to some discourse referent \(y \in A_{K},\) where \(K\) is
the DRS in which \(x\) is introduced.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is important to note that neither the notion of accessibility nor
the accessibility constraint need be stipulated. For, as we will
presently see, both follow from the way the DRS language is
interpreted (cf. the notion of variable binding in standard predicate
logic). Thus, we are not at liberty to modify the accessibility
relation, should we wish to do so, unless we simultaneously revise the
truth conditions associated with the DRS language. The accessibility
constraint is a semantic one.</p>

<p>
As discussed in
 <a href="#DonkPron">Section 2</a>,
 the main syntactic constraint on bound-variable pronouns is that they
be c-commanded by their antecedents. The domain of the accessibility
constraint overlaps with that of the c-command constraint, but it is
wider. For one thing, sentence boundaries don&rsquo;t affect
accessibility. For another, within the confines of a sentence, the
semantic correlate of an expression \(E_{1}\) may be accessible to
that of \(E_{2},\) even if \(E_{1}\) doesn&rsquo;t c-command
\(E_{2}.\) To illustrate this point, consider the conditional donkey
sentence in
 <a href="#ex4_1a">[1a]</a>
 and its sentence DRS in
 <a href="#ex4_1b">[1b]</a>:</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex4_1a">[1a]</dt>
<dd>\([_{S} [_{S} \textrm{ If} [_{S} [_{\textrm{NP}} \textrm{a
farmer}] [_{\textrm{VP}} \textrm{owns a donkey}]] [_{S} \textrm{he
beats it}]\,]\)</dd>
<dt id="ex4_1b">[1b]</dt>

<!--pdf exclude begin-->
<dd>\(\cb{[_{1} : [_{2} \R{x}, \R{y}: \textrm{farmer}(\R{x}),

</dl>

<p>
Syntactically speaking, neither &ldquo;a farmer&rdquo; nor &ldquo;a
donkey&rdquo; can bind (in the sense of Chomsky 1986) an expression
beyond the smallest clause in which they occur. In particular, neither
can bind any of the pronouns in the main clause of [1a]. But the
discourse referents associated with these indefinites, i.e.,
\(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{y}}\), are in the accessible domain of
[1b<sub>3</sub>], and therefore the anaphoric discourse referents in
this embedded DRS can be linked to \(\cb{\R{x}}\) and \(\cb{\R{y}}\).
Put otherwise, they are bindable at a semantic but not at a syntactic
level.</p>

<h3 id="Sema">4.3 Semantics</h3>

<p>
The truth-conditional semantics of the DRS language is given by
defining when an embedding function <strong>verifies</strong> a DRS in
a given model. An embedding function is a partial mapping from
discourse referents to individuals. Given two embedding functions
\(f\) and \(g\) and a DRS \(K\), we say that \(g\) extends \(f\) with
respect to \(K\), or \(f[K]g\) for short, iff \(\textit{Dom}(g) =
\textit{Dom}(f) \cup U_{K},\) and for all \(x\) in \(\textit{Dom}(f):
f(x) = g(x).\) Viewing functions as set-theoretic objects, this can be
formulated more succinctly as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>
\(f[K]g\) iff \(f \subset g\) and \(\textit{Dom}(g) = \textit{Dom}(f)
\cup U_{K}\)</p>
</div>

<p>
In the following we define what it takes for an embedding function to
verify a DRS or DRS-condition in a given model. As usual, a model
\(M\) is a pair \(\langle D,I\rangle,\) where \(D\) is a set of
individuals, and <em>I</em> is an interpretation function that assigns
sets of individuals to one-place predicates, sets of pairs to
two-place predicates, and so on. To enhance the legibility of our
definition somewhat we omit the qualifier &ldquo;in \(M\)&rdquo;
throughout:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Verifying embeddings</strong></dt>
<dd>

<ul style="padding-left:0;margin-top:0">

<li>\(f\) verifies a DRS \(K\) iff \(f\) verifies all conditions in
\(\textit{Con}_{K}.\)</li>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(P(x_{1}, \ldots , x_{n})\) iff \(\langle
f(x_{1}),\) &hellip;, \(f(x_{n})\rangle \in I(P).\)</li>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(x\cb{=}y\) iff \(f(x) = f(y).\)</li>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(\cb{\neg }K\) iff there is no \(g\) such that
\(f[K]g\) and \(g\) verifies \(K.\)</li>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(K\cb{\lor }K'\) iff there is a \(g\) such that
\(f[K]g\) and \(g\) verifies \(K\) or \(K'.\)</li>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(K\cb{\Rightarrow }K'\) iff, for all \(f[K]g\)
such that \(g\) verifies \(K\), there is an \(h\) such that \(g[K']h\)
and \(h\) verifies \(K'.\)</li>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(K(\cb{\forall} x)K'\) iff, for all individuals
\(d \in D_{M}\) and for all \(f[K]g\) such that \(g(x) = d\) and \(g\)
verifies \(K\), every \(h\) such that \(g[K']h\) verifies \(K'.\)</li>
</ul> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The last clause gives a strong interpretation to universal duplex
conditions (cf.
 <a href="#QuanVsInde">Section 3.2</a>);
 the weak interpretation is obtainable as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(f\) verifies \(K(\cb{\forall }x)K'\) iff, for all individuals
\(d \in D_{M}\) for which there is a \(g\) such that \(f[K]g,\) \(g(x)
= d,\) and \(g\) verifies \(K\), there is an \(h\) such that
\(g\)[K']h\) and \(h\) verifies \(K'.\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
A DRS is true in a given model iff we can find a verifying embedding
for it, as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Truth</strong></dt>
<dd>A DRS \(K\) is true in a model \(M\) iff there is an embedding
function \(f\) such that \(\textit{Dom}(f) = U_{K}\) and \(f\)
verifies \(K\) in \(M\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
To see how accessibility follows from these definitions, the critical
junctures are the points at which extensions of embedding functions
are called for. For example, consider a schematic DRS with a
conditional in it:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex4_2">[2]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{x}: \R{A}(\R{x}), [\R{y}: \R{B}(\R{x},\R{y})]
\rightarrow [\R{z}: \R{C}(\R{x},\R{y},\R{z})] ]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This DRS is true iff we can find an embedding function \(f\),
\(\textit{Dom}(f) = {\cb{\R{x}}},\) which verifies all conditions in
 <a href="#ex4_2">[2]</a>,
 which is to say that \(f(\cb{\R{x}})\) must be an \(\cb{\R{A}},\) and
\(f\) verifies the complex condition \(\cb{[y: \R{B}(\R{x},\R{y})]
\rightarrow [\R{z}: \R{C}(\R{x},\R{y},\R{z})]}.\) The latter
requirement is met iff every extension \(g\) of \(f\),
\(\textit{Dom}(g) = \{\cb{\R{x},\R{y}\}},\) such that \(g\) verifies
\(\cb{[\R{y}: \R{B}(\R{x},\R{y})]}\) can be extended to a function
\(h, \textit{Dom}(h) = {\cb{\R{x},\R{y},\R{z}}},\) such that \(h\)
verifies \(\cb{[\R{z}: \R{C}(\R{x},\R{y},\R{z})]}.\) Hence, no matter
how we choose \(g\), \(g(\cb{\R{x}})\) must be the same individual as
\(f(\cb{\R{x}},\)) and for any \(g,\) no matter how we choose \(h,\)
\(h(\cb{\R{x}})\) and \(h(\cb{\R{y}})\) must be the same as
\(g(\cb{\R{x}})\) and \(g(\cb{\R{y}}),\) respectively. This is why
\(\cb{\R{x}}\) is in the accessible domain associated with the
antecedent of the conditional, and why \(\cb{\R{y}}\) is in the
accessible domain associated with the consequent.</p>

<h2 id="ApplExte">5. Applications and extensions</h2>

<p>
Having focussed thus far on the interpretation of anaphoric pronouns,
the purpose of this section is to illustrate how the ideas lying at
the heart of DRT have been applied to other phenomena. We will
restrict ourselves to three topics: tense, presupposition, and
propositional attitudes. In the first two cases, we will encounter
interpretative dependencies reminiscent of the dependency relation
between an anaphor and its antecedent, and we will describe, if only
in outline, how basic DRT has been extended so as to capture the
similarities. DRT&rsquo;s representationalism comes into its own in
its treatment of attitudes and attitude ascriptions, which is the
third topic on our list. In
 <a href="#DiscRelaSDRT">section 6</a>
 we introduce SDRT, a significant extension of the DRT framework
designed to model discourse structure more accurately.</p>

<h3 id="Tens">5.1 Tense</h3>

<p>
Historically, the original ideas behind DRT grew out of Kamp&rsquo;s
earlier work on tense logic (Kamp 1971) and the apparent inability of
such static systems to adequately capture the interpretation of tense
and aspect in natural language discourse (Kamp 1981b [2017]).
Crucially, as Partee (1973) had already pointed out, there are
systematic parallels between tenses and pronouns, and, as Partee
(1984) herself also showed, these parallels can be adequately captured
in a DRT framework. In the following we will briefly discuss some of
Partee&rsquo;s observations, and outline a DRT treatment.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_1a">[1a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro owns a donkey. He beats it.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_1b">[1b]</dt>
<dd>Yesterday, Pedro tried to kiss Juanita. She slapped him.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Intuitively, the indefinite description &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; in the
opening sentence of
 <a href="#ex5_1a">[1a]</a>
 serves to introduce an entity that is subsequently picked up by the
pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the second sentence, and the DRT account
of indefinites and pronouns seeks to formalize this intuitive picture.
 <a href="#ex5_1b">[1b]</a>
 shows that a very similar phenomenon occurs in the temporal domain,
for in this case it is natural to construe the past tense of the
second sentence as being anaphorically dependent on the content of the
first: presumably, Juanita slapped Pedro right after he tried to kiss
her. In order to capture this idea, DRT adopts an event-based
semantics, treating events as semantic values of a designated class of
discourse referents. Sentences are now construed like indefinite
descriptions in that they, too, serve to introduce discourse
referents. For example, the first sentence in [1b] introduces a
discourse referent of the event type that represents Pedro&rsquo;s
attempting to kiss Juanita, and the tense morpheme in
&ldquo;slapped&rdquo; is construed as referring back, very much like
an anaphoric pronoun, to that event: by default, the time of
Juanita&rsquo;s slapping Pedro will be taken to be immediately after
the time of him trying to kiss her.</p>

<p>
Our second example involves what one might call &ldquo;donkey
tense&rdquo;:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_2a">[2a]</dt>
<dd>Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_2b">[2b]</dt>
<dd>Whenever Pedro tried to kiss Juanita, she slapped him.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In an event-based semantics, it is natural to construe
 <a href="#ex5_2b">[2b]</a>
 as quantifying over events, just like
 <a href="#ex5_2a">[2a]</a>
 quantifies over individuals. In conjunction with the DRT treatment of
quantification, this allows us to interpret the tense in
&ldquo;slapped&rdquo; as referring back to the event introduced in the
subordinate clause, along the following lines (where \(\cb{\rar}\)
stands for the &ldquo;right after&rdquo; relation,
\(\cb{\ul{\R{e}}''}\) is the variable introduced by the tense in
&ldquo;slapped&rdquo;, and its underlining indicates that it requires
an antecedent):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_3a">[3a]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{x}, \R{y}: \textrm{Pedro}(\R{x}),
\textrm{Juanita}(\R{y}),}\)</dd>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{e}: \textrm{try-to-kiss}(\R{e},\R{x},\R{y})](\forall
\R{e})[\R{e}', \ul{\R{e}}'' : \R{e}'' \rar \R{e}',
\textrm{slap}(\R{e}',\R{y},\R{x})] ]}\)</dd>
<dt id="ex5_3b">[3b]</dt>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{x}, \R{y}: \textrm{Pedro}(\R{x}),
\textrm{Juanita}(y),}\)</dd>
<dd>\(\cb{[\R{e}: \textrm{try-to-kiss}(\R{e},\R{x},\R{y})](\forall
\R{e})[\R{e}': \R{e} \rar \R{e}', \textrm{slap}(\R{e}',\R{y},\R{x})]
]}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In
 <a href="#ex5_3a">[3a]</a>
 the past tense in &ldquo;slapped&rdquo; introduces an anaphoric
element, which can be bound in the restrictor of the quantifier, just
as an ordinary donkey pronoun might be bound. The result, after a
minor simplification, is
 <a href="#ex5_3b">[3b]</a>,
 which says that every event \(\cb{\R{e}}\) of Pedro trying to kiss
Juanita is immediately followed by an event \(\cb{\R{e}'}\) of her
slapping him. Note that, although this DRS captures the most natural
interpretation of the past tense in &ldquo;slapped&rdquo;, it leaves
the past tense in &ldquo;tried&rdquo; unaccounted for. But this is as
it should be, for if tense is anaphoric, then that tense, too, should
be linked to a salient time point, which seems to be right: in the
absence of a context that furnishes such a time,
 <a href="#ex5_2b">[2b]</a>
 is simply infelicitous; it is like saying &ldquo;He is
handsome&rdquo; when it is not clear whom the pronoun is intended to
refer to.</p>

<h3 id="Pres">5.2 Presupposition</h3>

<p>
Presuppositions are chunks of information associated with particular
lexical items or syntactic constructions. There are many such items
and constructions, and the following is just a small selection:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Factive verbs</strong></dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag3em notopmargin">
<dt id="ex5_4a">[4a]</dt>
<dd>Juan knows that Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_4b">[4b]</dt>
<dd>Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
<dt><strong>It-clefts</strong></dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag3em notopmargin">
<dt id="ex5_5a">[5a]</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s in the stable that Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_5b">[5b]</dt>
<dd>Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
</dl> </dd>

<!--pdf include </dl>

<dl class="avoid-break"> pdf include-->
<dt><strong>Definites</strong></dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag3em notopmargin">
<dt id="ex5_6a">[6a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_6b">[6b]</dt>
<dd>Pedro has a donkey.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Someone who utters any of the [a] sentences commits himself to the
truth of the respective [b] sentence. Of course, this does nothing to
distinguish presuppositions from ordinary entailments, but the
difference becomes apparent when we embed presuppositional expressions
or constructions in non-entailing environments, as in:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_7a">[7a]</dt>
<dd>It isn&rsquo;t in the stable that Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_7b">[7b]</dt>
<dd>Maybe it&rsquo;s in the stable that Pedro beats his donkey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Here
 <a href="#ex5_5a">[5a]</a>
 is embedded in the scope of a negation and a modal operator,
respectively, and it appears that these sentences commit a speaker to
the truth of
 <a href="#ex5_5b">[5b]</a>
 just as much as [5a] does. This behavior sets presuppositions apart
from ordinary entailments.</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, presuppositions tend to escape from
<strong>any</strong> embedded position in the sense that, if a
sentence <em>S</em> contains a presupposition-inducing expression
<em>P</em>, an utterance of <em>S</em> will usually imply that
<em>P</em> holds. This is only generally speaking, because this rule,
though correct in the majority of cases, does not hold without
exceptions:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_8a">[8a]</dt>
<dd>It may be that Pedro is a mean farmer, and that he beats his
donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_8b">[8b]</dt>
<dd>It may be that Pedro has a donkey, and that he beats his
donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_9a">[9a]</dt>
<dd>If Pedro is a mean farmer, he beats his donkey.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_9b">[9b]</dt>
<dd>If Pedro has a donkey, he beats his donkey.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
While the [a] sentences would normally commit a speaker to the claim
that Pedro has a donkey, the same does not hold for the [b] sentences.
It appears, therefore, that presuppositions are typically though not
invariably inherited by the sentences in which they occur. This is the
so-called &ldquo;projection problem&rdquo; for presuppositions.</p>

<p>
Considering that anaphora and presupposition were widely discussed
from the late 1960s onward, it took a remarkably long time before it
was discovered that, in some respects at least, the two phenomena are
very similar (van der Sandt 1992; Kripke 2009). To see how, consider
the following pairs:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_10a">[10a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro owns a donkey. Juan knows {it / that he owns a donkey}.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_10b">[10b]</dt>
<dd>If Pedro owns a donkey, Juan knows {it / that he owns a
donkey}.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_10c">[10c]</dt>
<dd>Every farmer who owns a donkey knows {it / that he owns a
donkey}.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is true that the variants with the &ldquo;that&rdquo;-complements
are slightly odd, but actually the fact that they are proves the point
we want to make; for it is clear that, in these examples, the pronoun
&ldquo;it&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;that he owns a donkey&rdquo;
perform the same duty, and if the latter sounds somewhat off it is
presumably because the former does the job just as well.</p>

<p>
While the factive verb &ldquo;know&rdquo; triggers the presupposition
that its clausal complement is true, this presupposition is
neutralized in
 <a href="#ex5_10b">[10b]</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex5_10c">[10c]</a>.
 If presuppositions behave similarly to anaphoric pronouns, it is
clear why that should be so: in both cases, the presupposition is
<strong>bound</strong> sentence-internally, just like the neuter
pronoun is bound.</p>

<p>
Presupposed information is information that is presented as given, and
according to the so-called &ldquo;binding theory&rdquo; of
presupposition this means that presuppositions want to have discourse
referents to bind to (van der Sandt 1992; Geurts 1999). However,
whereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in the absence of
a suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all
presupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may
felicitously assert that she met &ldquo;Pedro&rsquo;s sister&rdquo;
even if she knows full well that her audience wasn&rsquo;t aware that
Pedro has a sister. In such cases, Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker
(1974) suggested, presuppositions are generally
<strong>accommodated</strong>, which is to say that the hearer accepts
the information as given, and revises his representation of the
context accordingly. Accommodation, thus understood, is a form of
exploitation in Grice&rsquo;s sense: the purpose of presuppositional
expressions is to signal that this or that information is given, and
if some information is new but not particularly interesting or
controversial (like the fact that somebody has a sister) the speaker
may choose to &ldquo;get it out of the way&rdquo; by presuppositional
means.</p>

<p>
The binding theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as
follows. Presuppositions, according to the theory, introduce
information that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are
already available in the DRS, and in this respect they are like
pronouns. However, if a suitable discourse referent is not available,
a new one will be accommodated, and the presupposition is linked to
that. Generally speaking, accommodation is not an option in the
interpretation of pronouns, and a possible reason for this is that a
pronoun&rsquo;s descriptive content is relatively poor. Being told
that &ldquo;she&rdquo; is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it
isn&rsquo;t clear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast,
if the speaker refers to &ldquo;Pedro&rsquo;s sister&rdquo; there is
more to go on, and accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, the binding
theory views pronouns as a special class of presuppositional
expressions. While all presupposition triggers prefer to be bound,
pronouns almost always must be bound. According to the binding theory,
this is because pronouns are descriptively attenuated, and therefore
cannot be construed by way of accommodation.</p>

<p>
In addition to the classic examples of presupposition triggers, the
binding theory of presupposition in DRT has been applied to a variety
of constructions that are not traditionally classified as
presupposition triggers, including proper names (Geurts 1997),
indexicals (Hunter 2013), and quotation (Geurts &amp; Maier 2005).
Arguments in each case involve pointing out examples of the
characteristic presuppositional behaviors. For proper names, for
instance, Geurts gives
 <a href="#ex5_11">[11]</a>
 as a case of donkey binding:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_11">[11]</dt>
<dd>If a child is christened &ldquo;Bambi&rdquo; and Disney Inc. find
out about it, they will sue Bambi&rsquo;s parents (Geurts 1997)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Geurts takes examples like these to support an analysis where a name
is analyzed as triggering the presupposition that there is someone
named thus. This analysis amounts to a form of descriptivism (names
function like definite descriptions, in this case descriptions of the
form &ldquo;the person named so-and-so&rdquo;). As such, it runs afoul
of Kripke&rsquo;s (1980) well-known anti-descriptivist argumentation,
i.e., that we incorrectly predict the following two statements,
uttered out of the blue, to be synonymous.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex5_12a">[12a]</dt>
<dd>Pedro is named &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo;.</dd>
<dt id="ex5_12b">[12b]</dt>
<dd>The person named &ldquo;Pedro&rdquo; is named
&ldquo;Pedro&rdquo;.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
As Kripke observes, while
 <a href="#ex5_12a">[12a]</a>
 expresses a contingent truth (his parents might have changed their
mind),
 <a href="#ex5_12b">[12b]</a>
 is, or at least has a reading that is, (weakly) necessary, which
shows that these sentences, and hence the name and the description,
are not equivalent. Similar arguments apply to indexicals and their
descriptive/presuppositional counterparts (&ldquo;I&rdquo; is not
equivalent to &ldquo;the speaker&rdquo;). DRT solutions to this
Kripkean challenge by Geurts &amp; Maier (2013), Maier (2009a), and
Hunter (2013) all involve adding distinct layers or levels to the DRS
language in which certain discourse referents and conditions are
evaluated with respect to the actual context of utterance (Kaplan
1989) and thus effectively rigidified. Kamp (2015) provides a more
drastic overhaul of the DRT framework to capture the semantics and
pragmatics of proper names in a broader mentalistic account of
attitudinal states, to which we turn now.</p>

<h3 id="AttiAttiAscr">5.3 Attitudes and attitude ascriptions</h3>

<p>
Propositional attitudes (mental states like belief, desire, or
imagination) and attitude ascriptions (sentences like &ldquo;John
thinks/hopes that Mary likes him&rdquo;) have been a rich source of
philosophical puzzles. DRT&rsquo;s representationalism offers fresh
solutions to some of them.</p>

<p>
A central issue in the philosophical/semantic analysis of attitudes is
that of logical omniscience: humans are cognitively limited agents,
and are not aware of all the consequences of their beliefs and
desires. On this basis, Kamp (1990) argues that the objects of thought
should not be seen as purely model-theoretic entities, for example a
set of belief worlds, as is common in logics of belief from Hintikka
(1962) onward. Rather, the logic of belief and other attitudes must
involve structured mental representations. The problem of logical
omniscience is then resolved in terms of the failure of human agents
to perform logically complete computations over these representations.
Modeling the objects of attitudes in this way, as representational
entities, allows us to make the fine distinctions necessary to
distinguish between believing that it is raining and believing that if
it is not raining then 37 is not prime. However, traditional versions
of such a sententialist or Language-of-Thought approach to omniscience
typically run into the problem of intentionality: to be useful to us,
our attitudes must somehow be about the external world we live in, so
we still have to explain how these syntactic representations connect
with reality. In a Hintikka-style possible worlds semantics the link
between world and attitude is hardwired into the semantics: believing
that John is happy means that the agent takes the actual world to be
an element of the set of worlds where John is happy. The DRT approach
combines these two strategies: use the classic, model-theoretic
semantics of the DRS language to cash out intentionality in terms of
possible worlds, but hold on to the representational level to model
resource-bounded computations in practical reasoning.</p>

<p>
A special type of intentionality is that of singular or <em>de re</em>
attitudes: beliefs and desires that directly involve objects in the
external world that the attitude holder is acquainted with. To capture
such attitudes, Kamp (1990) introduces anchors. An internal anchor is
a descriptive mode of presentation, in the form of a DRS with a
distinguished discourse referent, while an external anchor maps that
discourse referent to an actual individual. A full-fledged entity
representation comprises an internal and an external anchor, and is a
construct closely related to the Mental Files of R&eacute;canati
(2012).</p>

<p>
A complete mental state representation then consists of</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>a set of internal anchors and attitude descriptions, each
consisting of a DRS paired with a mode indicator (e.g.,
\(\cb{\textrm{ANCH}},\) \(\cb{\textrm{BEL}},\) \(\cb{\textrm{DES}})\)
and possibly sharing discourse referents, and</li>

<li>an external anchor mapping the internally anchored discourse
referents to objects of acquaintance.</li>
</ol>

<p>
By way of illustration, the mental state representation below
describes my <em>de re</em> belief that this cup \(c\) I&rsquo;m
holding now contains coffee, along with the desire that it is still
warm:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex5_13">
<dt id="ex5_13a">[13a]</dt>
<dd>internal mental state: 
\[\cb{\begin{multline}
\{ \langle \textrm{ANCH } \R{x}, [\R{x}: \textrm{cup}(\R{x}), \textrm{hold}(\R{i},\R{x})]\rangle ,\\
 \langle \textrm{BEL}, [\R{y}: \textrm{contains}(\R{x},\R{y}), \textrm{coffee}(\R{y})]\rangle ,\\
 \langle \textrm{DES}, [: \textrm{warm}(\R{y})]\rangle \}
\end{multline}}\]
</dd>
<dt id="ex5_13b">[13b]</dt>
<dd>external anchor: \(\cb{\{\langle \R{x},c\rangle \}}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Compartmentalized mental state representations with entity
representations like in
 <a href="#ex5_13">[13]</a>
 have been turned into semantic theories of attitude ascriptions and
used to solve a variety of familiar philosophical puzzles, such as
those involving Kripke&rsquo;s (1979) Pierre who believes Londres is
pretty but London is not (i.e., puzzles involving &ldquo;double
vision&rdquo;, see Asher 1986; Kamp 2015), Geach&rsquo;s (1967) Hob
who believes a witch killed his cow while Nob believes she, the same
witch, blighted his mare (i.e., puzzles of intentional identity, see
Asher 1987), and Karttunen&rsquo;s (1973) examples of presuppositions
triggered under non-doxastic attitude verbs but filtered out by
doxastic ones (i.e., puzzles involving parasitic attitudes, see Maier
2015). Other applications of what Kamp calls Mental State DRT (MSDRT)
include semantic analyses of specific indefinites (Kamp &amp;
Bende-Farkas 2019) and reference to fictional entities (Maier 2017;
Kamp 2021). All of the semantic analyses listed above exploit the dual
nature of DRT, i.e., they use both the representational level
(featuring (in)accessible discourse referents, embedded DRS&rsquo;s,
presupposition accommodation, etc.) and the model-theoretic semantics
(featuring entities, possible worlds, contexts etc.)</p>

<h2 id="DiscRelaSDRT">6. Discourse relations in SDRT</h2>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve seen in
 <a href="#BasiDRT">section 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#DRSLangSyntSemaAcce">section 4</a>
 above how anaphora resolution is constrained by accessibility. But
there are many other factors that play a role in the resolution
process, from local, grammatical factors like subject antecedents
being generally more prominent than object antecedents in pronoun
resolution, to more global, discourse structural factors. Focusing on
the latter, Hobbs (1979) argues that the interpreter&rsquo;s desire to
create a maximally coherent interpretation will often play a decisive
role in choosing between multiple accessible antecedents for a
pronoun, as he illustrates with the following contrast:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex6_1a">[1a]</dt>
<dd>John can open Bill&rsquo;s safe. He knows the combination.</dd>
<dt id="ex6_1b">[1b]</dt>
<dd>John can open Bill&rsquo;s safe. He&rsquo;ll have to change the
combination soon.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In
 <a href="#ex6_1a">[1a]</a>
 the pronoun binds to John, because that delivers the most coherent
interpretation of the two-sentence discourse as a whole. In
 <a href="#ex6_1b">[1b]</a>,
 by contrast, the pronoun is bound to Bill. This difference
corresponds to a difference in the kind of coherence relations
exemplified by the two discourses: [1a] exemplifies a coherence
relation known as Elaboration, while [1b] is an instance of Result.
That discourse relations play an important role in discourse
interpretation is shown by examples like
 <a href="#ex6_2">[2]</a>
 (again from Hobbs 1979).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex6_2">[2]</dt>
<dd>John took a train from Paris to Istanbul. He likes spinach.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Reading
 <a href="#ex6_2">[2]</a>
 you might wonder if Turkish spinach is really that much better than
what you can get in France, which shows to what lengths we go to
accommodate a suitable coherence relation, in this case Explanation,
before we give up our quest for a coherent interpretation.</p>

<p>
Asher and Lascarides (2003) take the idea that pronoun resolution and
the inference of coherence relations between discourse units are
closely related processes as the starting point for their Segmented
Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT), combining DRT with insights
from discourse coherence theories like Hobbs&rsquo;s. SDRT assumes a
set of discourse relations (Narration, Result, Contrast, Explanation,
Elaboration, Correction, to name a few) that we may infer to connect
the propositions expressed by the individual sentences (or clauses),
in order to create a maximally coherent interpretation of the
discourse as a whole. Different types of discourse relations may lead
to discourse structural configurations that impose different
constraints on anaphora resolution over and above DRT&rsquo;s
accessibility. Take the example in
 <a href="#ex6_3">[3]</a>
 (Asher &amp; Lascarides 2003).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="ex6_3">
<dt id="ex6_3a">[3a]</dt>
<dd>John had a great evening last night.</dd>
<dt id="ex6_3b">[3b]</dt>
<dd>He had a great meal.</dd>
<dt id="ex6_3c">[3c]</dt>
<dd>He ate salmon.</dd>
<dt id="ex6_3d">[3d]</dt>
<dd>He devoured lots of cheese.</dd>
<dt id="ex6_3e">[3e]</dt>
<dd>He won a dancing competition.</dd>
<dt id="ex6_3f">[3f]</dt>
<dd>??It was a beautiful pink.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In standard DRT the salmon introduced in
 <a href="#ex6_3c">[3c]</a>
 would provide a suitable and accessible antecedent for the pronoun in
 <a href="#ex6_3f">[3f]</a>,
 but in fact this resolution appears to be unavailable. SDRT explains
this observation in terms of a discourse structural constraint known
as the Right Frontier Constraint (Polanyi 1988). This constraint is
best illustrated by drawing a discourse structure graph like the one
below. A horizontal arrow in this graph indicates a coordinating
discourse relation (where neither relatum dominates the other), in
this case Narration. A vertical arrow indicates a subordinating
discourse relation (where a nucleus dominates a satellite), in this
case Elaboration.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig1">
<img alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" src="diagram.svg" style="width:20em" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figcap">Figure 1</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig1">extended description of figure 1</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
SDRT&rsquo;s version of the Right Frontier Constraint says that the
pronoun in
 <a href="#ex6_3f">[3f]</a>
 can only find an antecedent introduced in the node that was just
introduced
 (<a href="#ex6_3e">[3e]</a>),
 or one that dominates it
 (<a href="#ex6_3a">[3a]</a>).</p>
 
<p>
More formally, an SDRS consists of such a discourse structure graph,
where each vertex corresponds to a discourse relation and each node to
a DRS. A common SDRS notation extends the familiar box notation of DRT
(see
 <a href="#DRSLangSyntSemaAcce">section 4</a>)
 with labels for elementary and complex discourse units:</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig2">
<img alt="a SDRS notation diagram: link to extended description below" src="box2.svg" style="width:20em" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figcap">Figure 2</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig2">extended description of figure 2</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
Anaphora and presupposition resolution rely on a modified notion of
accessibility that incorporates the Right Frontier Constraint (Polanyi
1988). The model-theoretic interpretation of an SDRS is built around a
set of special interpretation rules for the various discourse
relations. Narration for instance comes with a semantic interpretation
rule that states that the both relata hold and moreover the main
events they introduce stand in a relation of temporal progression.
Some notational shortcuts: \(K{\pi}\) is the DRS associated with label
\(\pi\) (i.e. the \(K\) such that \(\pi : K\) occurs somewhere in the
SDRS); \(e_{\pi}\) is the unique event discourse referent that occurs
in \(U(K_{\pi})\) (for readability we left out event referents from
the example SDRS above, but for the purpose of modelling narrative
temporal progression in SDRT we should treat every verb phrase as
introducing an event discourse referent).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(f\) verifies \(\cb{\textrm{Narration}(\pi_{1},\pi_{2})}\) iff there
is an embedding function \(g\) such that \(f[K_{\cb{\pi_1}}]g\) and
\(g\) verifies \(K_{\cb{\pi_1}},\) and there is an embedding \(h\)
such that \(g[K_{\cb{\pi_2}}]h\) and \(h\) verifies \(K_{\cb{\pi_2}}\)
and moreover \(h(e_{\cb{\pi_1}}) \rar h(e_{\cb{\pi_2}})\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although we&rsquo;re treating SDRT here as an extension of DRT, the
theory of discourse structure it provides is entirely compatible with
other forms of dynamic semantics providing the contents of the
elementary discourse units. In fact, SDRT does not even require those
units to be linguistic in nature&mdash;as long as we&rsquo;re
interpreting sequences of discourse units that express propositional
contents and introduce discourse referents for events and individuals.
The framework has thus proved useful for studying multimodal discourse
like speech-plus-gesture (Lascarides &amp;Stone 2009), text-plus-emoji
(Maier 2023), or even primarily visual narratives like comics and film
(Bateman &amp;Wildfeuer 2014).</p>

<h2 id="ReprComp">7. Representationalism and compositionality</h2>

<p>
DRT is a representational theory of interpretation. In the DRT
framework, sentences have meanings, if at all, only in a derivative
sense: a sentence prompts the hearer to modify his DRS, and it is DRSs
that have a truth-conditional interpretation. Thus, a sentence causes
a DRS \(K_{i}\) to be transformed into a DRS \(K_{i+1}\) (usually,
though not invariably, the process will consist in adding information
to <span class="nobr">\(K_{i}\)),</span> and at a remove there is an
associated transition at the semantical level, from \(K_{i}\)&rsquo;s
interpretation to \(K_{i+1}\)&rsquo;s. Hence, if we could cut out the
representational middleman, we would have a theory that defines
sentence meaning in dynamic terms, as a transition from one semantic
object to another. Thus arises the question of whether or not the
representational level can be dispensed with. Kamp (1981a) claimed
that representations were essential to his <strong>ur</strong>-version
of DRT, which was a subset of our basic DRT, but in the meantime he
was proved wrong by a slew of dynamic theories that recast classical
DRT in purely semantical terms: Barwise (1987), Rooth (1987),
Groenendijk and Stokhof (1990, 1991), Muskens (1996), and many more.
However, Kamp&rsquo;s claim still holds for various extensions of
classical DRT, like the theories of presupposition and attitude
ascription discussed in the foregoing.</p>

<p>
These theories are allegedly &ldquo;non-representational&rdquo;, but
what exactly does that mean? Consider, for example, Groenendijk and
Stokhof&rsquo;s (1991) Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL), which provides a
dynamic semantics for the language of classical predicate logic, in
which &ldquo;Pedro owns a donkey and beats it&rdquo; may be rendered
as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="ex7_1">[1]</dt>
<dd>\(\exists x [\textrm{donkey}(x) \amp
\textrm{own}(\textrm{Pedro},x)] \amp
\textrm{beat}(\textrm{Pedro},x)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
DPL&rsquo;s semantics ensures that, unlike in classical logic, the
last occurrence of \(x\) is bound by the existential quantifier. The
way this works is that DPL analyzes sentence meanings in terms of
variable assignments, which are manipulated by the logical constants
in such as way that
 <a href="#ex7_1">[1]</a>
 is true in a model \(M\) iff \(M\)&rsquo;s domain features an
individual which, when assigned to the variable \(x,\) makes each of
the atomic sentences in [1] come out true in \(M\). Formally, this is
implemented by stipulating that the meaning of a sentence is a
relation between variable assignments.</p>

<p>
A variable assignment is a mapping from variables to individuals, and
variables are linguistic expressions, so it can hardly be claimed that
assignments are non-representational entities. Therefore, it is a bit
puzzling that, in contrast to DRT, DPL is widely seen as a
non-representational variety of dynamic semantics. True, DRT&rsquo;s
representationalism goes quite a bit further than DPL&rsquo;s, and the
two theories are obviously very different in this respect, but both
theories import representational elements into semantics, and this
holds for dynamic theories of semantics generally (though see Dekker
2012 for exceptions).</p>

<p>
Note, incidentally, that DRT&rsquo;s representationalism is not
particularly troubling from a psychological point of view. For if we
adopt a cognitivist perspective, and view DRT as a (somewhat abstract)
theory of the psychology of interpretation, then its
representationalism wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly controversial,
since for most psychologists, the controversy is not over whether
there exist mental representations, but over what they are like.</p>

<p>
One way in which DRT&rsquo;s representationalism manifests itself as
being more radical than other theories&rsquo; is that it is a
non-compositional theory as well. These two features are intertwined.
Consider, for instance, the way pronouns are interpreted in basic DRT,
by first setting up a discourse referent, which is subsequently linked
to another discourse referent. This is a non-deterministic process,
but even if it were not, it is clear that the anaphoric link is not
part of the meaning of the pronoun. A standard statement of
compositionality would say that the meaning of a compound expression
must be a function of the meaning of their components and their mode
of combination. But if some of the components, like pronouns, do not
introduce into the DRS any object that can naturally be described as
the meaning of that object, then it is clear that we do not have a
compositional system.</p>

<p>
How bad is it that we lose compositionality? It is generally agreed
that some of the standard arguments for compositionality are not
particularly compelling. In particular, we don&rsquo;t need
compositionality to explain why people can understand an indefinite
number of sentences, and we don&rsquo;t need it for explaining how
languages can be learned. To explain such facts, it suffices that
there is some procedure for establishing the meanings of sentences,
but it is not strictly necessary for this procedure to be
compositional. Compositionality is often viewed as a methodological
principle (Groenendijk &amp; Stokhof 1990, 1991; Janssen 1997; Dever
1999), since any model of interpretation can be made compositional if
we are sufficiently relaxed about the nature of lexical meanings
and/or the syntactic structures over which the compositional theory is
defined. In the case of DRT, the standard approaches to making the
system compositional involve dispensing with Kamp&rsquo;s construction
algorithm, and replacing it with a system in which DRSs can be
composed either through suitable merge operations (Zeevat 1989b), or,
in dynamic semantic systems like those of Groenendijk and Stokhof
(1990) and Muskens (1996), through use of function application in a
lambda calculus. But while most such systems capture meanings for
sentences that are closely related to those of original DRT, they do
not capture every aspect of DRT. In particular, whereas anaphora
resolution is an integral part of DRT, in compositional theories
anaphora resolution is assumed to be performed by a separate component
of the theory.</p>

<p>
Representationalism and compositionality are issues that have produced
great disagreement amongst semanticists and philosophers of language
in the 1980s. The methodological view of compositionality has reduced
what appeared once to be a substantive argument to a matter of taste,
and as regards DRT it has been shown that researchers who care about
compositionality are free to adopt a variant of the original system
with many of its features, but none of its non-compositionality. But
representationalism may be a more serious issue, for if it is true, as
we have suggested, that dynamic theories generally rely on a notion of
meaning that contains at least some form of representation, then that
notion could do with a bit more philosophical attention than it has
received so far.</p>
