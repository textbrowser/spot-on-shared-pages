<h2 id="DreaEpis">1. Dreams and epistemology</h2>

<h3 id="CartDreaSkep">1.1 Cartesian dream skepticism</h3>

<p>
Dream skepticism has traditionally been the most widely discussed
philosophical problem raised by dreaming (see Williams 1978; Stroud
1984). Its most famous formulation is the one presented by Descartes
in the <em>Meditations</em>. There, skeptical doubts are employed
&ldquo;to demolish everything completely and start again right from
the foundations&rdquo; (AT 7:17, CSM 2:12) of certain, indubitable
belief. The dreaming doubt is the first of two major skeptical doubts
formulated in the Meditations; the second is the evil genius doubt
(Newman 2023).</p>

<p>
Descartes begins his investigation of the reliability of sensory-based
beliefs by considering commonplace sensory illusions such as seeing
things as too big or small. However, because such errors can easily be
avoided by taking a closer look, these cases do not undermine the
general reliability of sensory perception. By contrast, dreams suggest
that even in a seemingly best-case scenario of sensory perception
(Stroud 1984), and against our best efforts, we can be deceived. As
Descartes puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
How often, asleep at night, am I convinced of just such familiar
events &mdash; that I am here in my dressing-gown, sitting by the fire
- when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! Yet at the moment my eyes
are certainly wide awake when I look at this piece of paper; I shake
my head and it is not asleep; as I stretch out and feel my hand I do
so deliberately, and I know what I am doing. All this would not happen
with such distinctness to someone asleep. Indeed! As if I did not
remember other occasions when I have been tricked by exactly similar
thoughts while asleep! (AT 7:19, CSM 2:13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes suggests that dreams and waking perception are qualitatively
similar. Even the realistic experience of sitting dressed by the fire
and looking at a piece of paper in one&rsquo;s hands (Descartes 1641:
I.5) is something that can, and according to Descartes often does,
occur in a dream. From this, he concludes that all sensory-based
beliefs, including beliefs about the external world and his own bodily
existence, are dubitable.</p>

<p>
Generally, two dreaming doubts can be distinguished: One undermines
the judgment that we are ever awake (the <em>Always Dreaming
Doubt</em>; see Newman 2023); the other undermines the judgment that
we are presently awake (the <em>Now Dreaming Doubt</em>; see Newman
2023). There is textual evidence of both dreaming doubts in the
Meditations (Newman 2023). Importantly, both versions rely on the
thesis that dreams are qualitatively similar to waking experiences.
Again, this allows for two readings: One, the thesis that dream and
waking experiences seem qualitatively similar to the dreamer after
awakening, and two, the thesis that dream and waking experiences seem
qualitatively similar only while dreaming. A natural interpretation of
the example of sitting by the fire is that dreams produce the full
range of sensory experiences in a way that seems qualitatively similar
to waking both while dreaming and after awakening (Newman 2023).</p>

<p>
Combined with the Now Dreaming Doubt, the alleged similarity of
dreaming and waking experience raises the possibility that at any
given time, our sensory experiences can be deceptive and give rise to
false beliefs; we would then be unable to tell which sensory-based
beliefs are and which are not deceptive. Combined with the Always
Dreaming Doubt, we get the idea that literally all of our
sensory-based beliefs might be deceptive. Even the first case is
concerning: even if we are sometimes awake, we can never rule out that
we are now dreaming, and so we cannot tell which of our sensory-based
beliefs to trust.</p>

<p>
At the same time, the dreaming doubt is not a full-scale
&ldquo;epistemic demolition&rdquo; tool (Newman 2023): Dreaming doubts
target only sensory-based beliefs. By contrast, according to
Descartes, that 2+3=5 or that a square has four sides is knowable even
if he is now dreaming, because such beliefs are not based on sensory
experiences. More generally:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
although, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule still holds that
all which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably true.
(Descartes 1641: V.15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such non-sensory based beliefs are subsequently targeted by the Evil
Genius Doubt (Newman 2023). But for Descartes, the dreaming doubt,
whatever its strength, does not on its own undermine our ability to
engage in the project of pure, rational enquiry (Frankfurt 1970; but
see Broughton 2002).</p>

<h3 id="EarlDiscDreaSkep">1.2 Earlier discussions of dream skepticism </h3>

<p>
Dream arguments have been a staple of philosophical skepticism since
antiquity and were so well known that in his objections to the
<em>Meditations</em>, Hobbes (1641) criticized Descartes for not
having come up with a more original argument. Yet, Descartes&rsquo;
version of the problem, more than any other, has generated
philosophical discussion.</p>

<p>
One reason might be that while Descartes considered dreams as raising
a distinctive epistemological threat, earlier versions tended to touch
upon dreams just briefly and alongside other examples of sensory
deception. For example, in the <em>Theaetetus</em> (157e), Plato has
Socrates discuss a defect in perception that is common to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
dreams and diseases, including insanity, and everything else that is
said to cause illusions of sight and hearing and the other senses,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
leading to the conclusion that knowledge cannot be defined through
perception.</p>

<p>
Augustine (<em>Against the Academics</em>; <em>Confessions)</em>
thought the dream problem could be contained, arguing that in
retrospect, we can distinguish both dreams and illusions from genuine
perception (Matthew 2005: chapter 8). By contrast, Montaigne (<em>The
Apology for Raymond Sebond</em>) noted that wakefulness itself teems
with reveries and illusions, which he thought to be more
epistemologically concerning than nocturnal dreams.</p>

<p>
Dreams also appear in the canon of standard skeptical arguments used
by the Pyrrhonists. Again, the contrast between dreaming and waking is
presented alongside a number of further contrasts (ranging from
differences in how things perceptually appear to cultural
differences), which all aim to induce in the reasoner a suspension of
judgment (Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of Eminent Philosophers;</em>
Sextus Empiricus, <em>Outlines of Pyrrhonism)</em>. There is another
sense, however, in which Pyrrhonian skepticism might lead to deeper
ontological concerns than those typically raised in the context of
dream arguments: If evidential conflicts, such as the ones aimed at in
the contrasts used by the Pyrrhonists, can be resolved only by appeal
to independent reasons, then there seems to be no obvious way to
privilege one side over the other (Veber 2017). There may then be no
independent reason to prefer sensory-based beliefs acquired while
waking over those acquired while dreaming. This is very different from
Descartes&rsquo; assumption in the Meditations that dreams are
deceptive whereas perceptual experience in waking, at least in a best
case scenario, is veridical.</p>

<h3 id="DreaOtheSkepScen">1.3 Dreaming and other skeptical scenarios</h3>

<p>
In the <em>Meditations</em>, after discussing the dream argument,
Descartes raises the possibility of an omnipotent evil genius
determined to deceive us even in our most basic beliefs. Contrary to
dream deception, Descartes emphasizes that the <em>evil genius
hypothesis</em> is a mere fiction. Still, it radicalizes the dream
doubt in two respects. One, where the dream argument leaves the
knowability of certain general truths intact, these are cast in doubt
by the evil genius hypothesis. Two, where the dream argument, at least
on some readings, involves just temporary deception, the evil genius
hypothesis has us permanently deceived.</p>

<p>
One modernized version, the <em>brain-in-a-vat</em> thought
experiment, says that if evil scientists placed your brain in a vat
and stimulated it in just the right way, your conscious experience
would be exactly the same as if you were still an ordinary, embodied
human being (Putnam 1981). The <em>Matrix</em>-trilogy (Chalmers 2005)
introduces a variation in that Matrixers unbeknownst to themselves
live in a computer simulation. Unlike the brain-in-a-vat, they have
bodies that are kept alive in pods, and flaws in the simulation allow
some of them to bend its rules to their advantage.</p>

<p>
While dream deception is typically cast as a regularly recurring
actuality (cf.Windt 2011), brain-in-a-vat-style arguments are often
thought to be merely logically or perhaps even nomologically possible.
It has also been argued, however, that there might be good reasons for
thinking that we actually live in a computer simulation (Bostrom
2003). Moreover, if we lend even some credence to radical skeptical
scenarios, we need to consider whether this has consequences for how
we act and how we live our lives (Schwitzgebel 2017).</p>

<p>
Finally, even purely hypothetical skeptical scenarios may capitalize
on the analogy with dreams to enhance their psychological force. Clark
(2005) argues that the <em>Matrix</em> is compelling in part because
it contains elements of &ldquo;industrial-strength deception&rdquo; in
which both sensory experience and intellectual functioning are exactly
the same as in standard wake-states, while other aspects are more
similar to the compromised reasoning and bizarre shifts that are the
hallmark of dreams.</p>

<h3 id="DescSoluDreaProbRealWorlDrea">1.4 Descartes&rsquo; solution to the dream problem and real-world dreams</h3>

<p>
At the end of the <em>Sixth Meditation</em>, Descartes suggests a
solution to the dream problem that is tied to a reassessment of what
it is like to dream. Contrary to his remarks in the <em>First
Meditation</em>, he notes that dreams are only rarely connected to
waking memories and are often discontinuous, as when dream characters
suddenly appear or disappear. He then introduces the coherence
test:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But when I perceive objects with regard to which I can distinctly
determine both the place whence they come, and that in which they are,
and the time at which they appear to me, and when, without
interruption, I can connect the perception I have of them with the
whole of the other parts of my life, I am perfectly sure that what I
thus perceive occurs while I am awake and not during sleep.
(Meditation VI. 24)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For all practical purposes, he has now found a mark by which dreaming
and waking can be distinguished (cf. <em>Meditation</em> I.7). While
the coherence test is not fail-safe, the threat of dream deception has
been contained.</p>

<p>
This shift in assessment of the dreaming doubt is related to the
narrative style of the Meditations. The first-person narrator of the
Meditations is supposed to exemplify everyone&rsquo;s epistemic
situation, illustrating the typical defects of the human mind. Readers
are further drawn in by Descartes&rsquo; strategy of moving from
commonsense examples towards more sophisticated philosophical claims
(Frankfurt 1970). This style is modeled on meditations or spiritual
exercises in traditional religious writing (Hatfield 2024).</p>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo; remarks about the discontinuous and ad hoc nature of
many dreams are backed up by empirical work on dream bizarreness
(Revonsuo &amp; Salmivalli 1995) and the widespread assumption that
bizarreness is a distinctive and pervasive feature of dreaming (but
see Rosen 2018b, Kirberg 2022 for critical discussion). Still, many of
his critics were not convinced. Even if Descartes&rsquo; revised
phenomenological description of dreaming characterizes most dreams,
one might occasionally merely <em>dream</em> of successfully
performing the test (Hobbes 1641), and in some dreams, one might
<em>seem</em> to have a clear and distinct idea but this impression is
false (Bourdin 1641). Both the coherence test and the criterion of
clarity and distinctness would then be unreliable.</p>

<p>
How considerations of empirical plausibility impact the dream argument
continues to be a matter of debate. Grundmann (2002) appeals to
scientific dream research to introduce an introspective criterion,
proposing that when we introspectively notice that we are able to
engage in critical reflection, we have good reason to think that we
are awake and not dreaming. Empirical considerations may also,
however, enhance the threat of the dreaming doubt, at least in certain
situations and for certain people (Windt 2015a). For example,
dream-reality confusion is prominent in people with narcolepsy. False
beliefs resulting from unrecognized dreams can persist for days or
weeks and lead to actions that have personal and sometimes even legal
consequences (Wamsley et al. 2014).</p>

<p>
Because the Cartesian version of the dreaming doubt builds upon the
supposed similarity between dreaming and waking perception, it is
closely linked to questions not just about empirical plausibility, but
about the ontology of dreaming. While questions on the ontology of
dreaming have gained prominence in the philosophy of dreaming since
the mid 20th century, these are often raised in the context of
epistemological questions or even cast as responses to Cartesian dream
skepticism.</p>

<h2 id="OntoDrea">2. The ontology of dreams</h2>

<p>
Since the middle of the 20th century, questions about the nature of
dream experience have been at the forefront of philosophical work on
dreaming. Often, claims about the ontology of dreaming have been
proposed as a solution to dream skepticism, for instance, by denying
that idea that dreams are experiences at all, or that they are
experiences of the relevant kind to be deceptive.</p>

<p>
In this entry, and consistent with much of the philosophical
literature on the ontology of dreaming, the term &ldquo;conscious
experience&rdquo; is used as an umbrella term for the occurrence of
sensations, thoughts, impressions, emotions etc. in dreams (cf.
Dennett 1976). These are all phenomenal states: there is something it
is <em>like</em> to be in these states for the subject of experience
(cf. Nagel 1974). To ask about dream experience is to ask <em>whether
it is like something</em> to dream <em>while</em> dreaming, and
whether <em>what</em> it is like is similar to (or relevantly
different from) corresponding waking experiences.</p>

<h3 id="DreaExpe">2.1 Are dreams experiences?</h3>

<p>
The most influential denial of dream experience was formulated by
Norman Malcolm (1956, 1959), though important aspects were
foreshadowed by Wittgenstein and others (1953: 184; see Chihara 1965
for discussion, Bouwsma 1945, and Macdonald 1953). At the heart of
Malcolm&rsquo;s argument was the idea that sleep is opposed to
consciousness: &ldquo;if a person is in <em>any</em> state of
consciousness it logically follows that he is not sound asleep&rdquo;
(Malcolm 1956: 21), implying that dreams occurring in sound sleep are
not experiences. Malcolm further argued that that first-person,
past-tense reports of dreaming, despite being superficially similar to
first-person, past-tense psychological reports of waking experiences,
have a different grammar and hence different meaning. In particular,
he denied that dream reports imply the occurrence of experiences (such
as thoughts, feelings, or judgements) in sleep:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If a man had certain thoughts and feelings in a dream it no more
follows that he had those thoughts and feelings while asleep, than it
follows from his having climbed a mountain in a dream that he climbed
a mountain while asleep. (Malcolm 1959/1962: 51&ndash;52)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Malcolm (1956) initially formulated his rejection of dream experience
as a response to Cartesian dream skepticism. Later (Malcolm
1959/1962), his main target became scientific dream research, which
gained traction following the discovery of REM (rapid eye movement)
sleep and its alleged association with dreaming (Dement &amp; Kleitman
1957). Malcolm (1959/1962) particularly objected to the proposal that
the physiological characteristics of REM sleep are objective markers
of the occurrence and duration of dreaming in preceding sleep periods
(Dement &amp; Kleitman 1957). According to Malcolm, adopting a
physiological criterion of dreaming (such as EEG measures of brain
activity during sleep, but also outward behavior such as sleeptalking
or sleepwalking) would change the concept of dreaming; by contrast,
Malcolm regarded retrospective reports as the only criterion of
dreaming and considered attempts to establish an objective science of
dreaming to be misguided.</p>

<p>
Malcolm&rsquo;s analysis of dreaming was widely criticized as assuming
an overly strict form of verificationism as well as a na&iuml;ve view
of language and conceptual change. Many of his critics objected that
justification does not depend on strict criteria with the help of
which the truth of a statement can be determined with absolute
certainty, but &ldquo;on appeals to the simplicity, plausibility, and
predictive adequacy of an explanatory system as a whole&rdquo;
(Chihara &amp; Fodor 1965: 197). This leaves open that behavioral
and/or physiological evidence may, contra Malcolm, be used to verify
dream reports (Ayer 1960).</p>

<p>
For example, Putnam argued that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the lexicographer would undoubtedly perceive the logical (or
semantical) connection between being a pediatrician and being a
doctor, but he would miss the <em>allegedly</em> &ldquo;logical&rdquo;
character of the connection between dreams and waking impressions.
[&hellip;] this &ldquo;depth grammar&rdquo; kind of analyticity (or
&ldquo;logical dependence&rdquo;) does not exist. (Putnam 1962 [1986]:
306)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Nagel pointed out that even if one accepts Malcolm&rsquo;s
analysis of the concept of dreaming,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is a mistake to invest the demonstration that it is impossible to
have experiences while asleep with more import than it has. It is an
observation about our use of the word &ldquo;experience&rdquo;, and no
more. It does not imply that nothing goes on in our minds while we
dream. (Nagel 1959: 114)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Overall, the upshot was that the question of dream experience, or
whether dream thoughts, feelings or beliefs should count as real
instances of their kind, should be considered an open empirical
question, and no conceptual contradiction is involved in saying one
has experiences in sleep.</p>

<p>
Dennett used an extended thought experiment to argue that settling the
question of dream experience requires independent empirical evidence.
Dennett&rsquo;s (1976, 1979) <em>cassette theory</em> says dreams are
the product of instantaneous memory insertion at the moment of the
awakening, as if a cassette with pre-scripted dreams had been inserted
into memory, ready for replay. While there would then be something it
is like to remember dreaming after awakening, there would be nothing
it is like to dream while asleep. Like Malcolm, Dennett was skeptical
of the idea that dreams are experiences. However, while Malcolm
regarded dream reports as the sole criterion of dreaming, Dennett
argued that dream reports cannot be used to distinguish between the
cassette theory and the idea that dreams are experiences. Moreover,
for Dennett, the unreliability of dream recall was not unique, but
exemplified a broader problem with memory reports, such that we
generally cannot use retrospective recall to distinguish conscious
experience from memory insertion (Dennett 1991; see also Emmett
1978).</p>

<p>
The cassette theory of dreaming was predated by earlier proposals that
dreams unfold in a single instant in sleep, rather than sequentially
and at a pace similar to waking experiences. Maury (1861) described a
long and complex dream about the French revolution that culminated in
his execution at the guillotine, at which point he awoke to find that
the headboard had fallen on his neck. Because the dream seemed to
systematically build up to this dramatic conclusion, which in turn
coincided with a sudden external event, he suggested that such cases
were best explained as instantaneous memory insertions experienced at
the moment of awakening. Similarly, Gregory (1916) described dreams as
psychical explosions to highlight their instantaneous occurrence at
the moment of awakening.</p>

<p>
Contemporary philosophers tend to agree that dreams are experiences
and this view is supported by empirical evidence from sleep physiology
(Flanagan 2000; Metzinger 2003; Revonsuo 2006; Windt 2013, 2015a). A
first reason for thinking that dreams are experiences during sleep is
the relationship between dreaming and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.
Researchers in the 1950s discovered that sleep is not a uniform state
of rest and passivity, but there is a complex sleep architecture
involving different stages of sleep that is relatively stable both
within and across individuals (Aserinsky &amp; Kleitman 1953, 1955;
Dement &amp; Kleitman 1957). Following sleep onset, periods of non-REM
(or NREM) sleep including slow wave sleep (so called because of the
presence of characteristic slow-wave, high-voltage EEG activity) are
followed by periods of high-frequency, low-voltage activity during REM
sleep, resembling waking EEG. Reports of dreaming are much more
frequent following REM (81.9%) than NREM sleep awakenings (43%;
Nielsen 2000). REM sleep is additionally characterized by rapid eye
movements and a near-complete loss of muscle tone (Dement 1999:
27&ndash;50; Jouvet 1999), potentially explaining the absence of
outwardly observable behavior during dreams.</p>

<p>
A second line of evidence comes from lucid dreams, or dreams in which
one knows one is dreaming and often has some level of dream control
(Voss et al. 2013; Voss &amp; Hobson 2015; Baird et al. 2019). The
term lucid dreaming was coined by van Eeden (1913), but Aristotle
(<em>On Dreams</em>) already noted that one can sometimes be aware
while dreaming that one is dreaming. Scientific evidence that lucid
dreaming is real and a genuine sleep phenomenon comes from laboratory
studies (Hearne 1978; LaBerge et al. 1981) showing lucid dreamers can
use specific, pre-arranged patterns of eye movements (e.g.,
right-left-right-left) to signal in real-time that they are now lucid.
These signals are clearly identifiable on the EOG (electrooculography)
and suggest a correspondence between dream-eye movements and real-eye
movements. Such signal-verified lucid dreams have even been used for
real-time communication between dreamers and experimenters, with lucid
dreamers responding to sound cues (Baird et al. 2021). Retrospective
reports confirm that the dreamer really was lucid and signalled
lucidity (Dresler et al. 2012; Stumbrys et al. 2014).</p>

<p>
Signal-verified lucid dreams have been used for studying muscular
activity accompanying subjective body movements in dreams (Erlacher et
al. 2003; Dresler et al. 2011), for advanced EEG analysis of brain
activity during lucid dreaming (Voss et al. 2009), and for imaging
studies (Dresler et al. 2011, 2012). Eye signals can also be used to
measure the duration of different activities performed in lucid
dreams; contrary to the cassette theory, lucid dreams have temporal
extension and certain dream actions even seem to take slightly longer
than in waking (Erlacher et al. 2014). There have also been attempts
to induce lucidity through non-invasive electrical stimulation during
sleep (Stumbrys et al. 2013; Voss et al. 2014: Carr et al. 2020). The
combination of signal-verified lucid dreaming with volitional control
over dream content, retrospective report, and objective sleep measures
has been proposed to provide controlled conditions for the study of
conscious experience in sleep and a new methodology for investigating
the relationship between conscious experience and neurophysiological
processes (Baird et al. 2019).</p>

<p>
A third line of evidence (Revonsuo 2006: 77) comes from
dream-enactment behavior (Nielsen et al. 2009), most prominently in
patients with REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD; Schenck &amp; Mahowald
1996; Schenck 2005; Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Due to a loss of
the muscular atonia that accompanies REM sleep in healthy subjects,
these patients show complex, seemingly goal-directed outward behaviors
such as running or fighting off an attacker during REM sleep.
Retrospective dream reports often match these behaviors, suggesting
that patients literally act out their dreams during sleep.</p>

<p>
Taken together, these lines of evidence have been interpreted as
empirically supporting the claim that REM dreams are experiences
(Revonsuo 2006). Moreover, dream reports obtained following timed
awakenings, often together with physiological measures from the
preceding sleep period, are regarded as the gold standard in dream
research, and it has been argued that under these conditions, dream
reports can be regarded as trustworthy sources of evidence about
experiences in the preceding sleep period (Windt 2013, 2015a). There
have, however, also been proposals for an updated form of skepticism
about dreams, such that empirical evidence for the fleeting nature of
dream recall is leveraged to cast doubt upon the trustworthiness of
dream reports (Rosen 2013, 2024b).</p>

<p>
These differences notwithstanding, the contemporary philosophical
debate on the evidential status of dream reports with respect to dream
experience has shifted from principled and theoretical questions about
verification and meaning to consideration of specific lines of
empirical evidence that is often seen to either support or undermine
the trustworthiness of certain types or aspects of dream reports (e.g.
reports of dreaming in color; Schwitzgebel 2002, 2011). It has been
suggested that while the philosophical debate in the second half of
the 20th century centered on a single report problem, which concerned
whether dream reports count as evidence for the occurrence of
experiences during sleep, this has now been replaced by a number of
different report problems that raise specific methodological questions
about which kind of dream report (such as free dream reports, but also
questionnaires and phenomenological interviews) and which types of
analysis (such as self- vs external ratings) are most suitable for
investigating different questions about dreaming (Dem&scaron;ar and
Windt 2024) and how to balance conflicting results.</p>

<h3 id="WhatKindConsExpeDrea">2.2 What kinds of conscious experience are dreams?</h3>

<p>
With increasing philosophical consensus that dreams are experiences,
focus has shifted to how best to describe the kinds of experience
involved in dreaming. An important question is whether dreaming is a
<em>sui generis</em> type of experience or one that is best described
in familiar wake-state terms. In the first option, dreams might still
bear deep similarity to different wake states such as imagination and
perception, but in a way that requires a description of their own
(Windt 2020). The most widely discussed contrast for the second option
is that between saying that dreams are perceptual (hallucinatory or
illusory) experiences vs imaginings. A related but separate question
is whether to dream <em>just is</em> to perceive, hallucinate,
imagine, mind wander, or remember (in a certain way), or whether
dreams rather contain perceptions, hallucinations, imaginings,
memories etc. The latter allows that dreams contain a mixture of
different mental states or that there is even variation across
(different types of) dreaming. For example, a pluralist can allow that
some aspects of dreaming are hallucinatory, others involve imaginings,
and yet again others illusory (Rosen 2018b). Yet another approach that
avoids strong ontological commitments is to compare dreams (or
particular dream phenomena) to wake-state perception, hallucination,
imagination and so on (Windt &amp; Noreika 2011). Often, these
different approaches will be intertwined to some degree.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Perception, hallucination, and illusion</h4>

<p>
The standard view is that dreams have the same phenomenal character as
waking perception in that they seemingly put us in contact with
mind-independent objects, yet no such object is being perceived. This
means dreams count as hallucinations in the traditional philosophical
sense (Crane &amp; French 2017; Macpherson 2013, 2024). Even if, in a
particularly realistic dream, my visual experience subjectively seemed
exactly as it would if I were awake (say, I could see the sun coming
in through the window and the pattern of my bed sheets), I would not,
while dreaming and lying asleep in bed with my eyes closed, be
<em>seeing</em> anything.</p>

<p>
The assumption of phenomenological equivalence between dream and
waking experience is exemplified by Descartes&rsquo; observation that
even when dreaming,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is certain that I seem to see light, hear a noise, and feel heat;
this cannot be false, and this is what in me is properly called
perceiving (<em>sentire</em>). (Descartes 1641: II.9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This idea is also central to the <em>virtual reality metaphor</em>,
according to which consciousness itself is dreamlike and waking
perception a kind of online hallucination modulated by the senses
(Llin&aacute;s &amp; Ribary 1994; Llin&aacute;s &amp; Par&eacute;
1991; Revonsuo 2006; Metzinger 2003, 2009). This metaphor finds its
philosophical expression in simulation theory (Revonsuo et al. 2015),
which defines dream experience through its self-in-a-world structure
(Revonsuo 2006: 84). Again, a natural reading is that dreaming feels
exactly like waking perception, it is only the connection to the
external world that is different (i.e., dreaming is offline as
external stimulus processing is blocked or at least diminished during
REM sleep).</p>

<p>
LaBerge and colleagues (2018) recently showed that eye tracking of
objects is smooth in lucid dreaming and perceiving, but not in
imagining. Drawing from this evidence, Rosen (2021) suggests many
dreams mimic the phenomenology of interacting with a stable world,
including eye movements and visual search. A potential problem is that
especially for subtle perceptual activities (such as visual search),
we might not know enough about dream phenomenology to make any strong
claims about whether dreams typically (or even just potentially)
replicate waking perceptual experience (Nielsen 2010). Specifying
points of similarity leads to a more nuanced view, in which some
dreams and/or some aspects of dreaming might be more perception-like
while others resemble imagination (Windt 2015a). For example, visual
imagery might be quite different from touch sensations, which tend to
be rare in dreams (Hobson 1988). And visual dream imagery itself might
overall resemble waking perception but lack color saturation,
background detail and focus (Rechtschaffen &amp; Buchignani, 1992).
Classifying dreams as either hallucinations or imaginings is further
complicated by the fact that there is strong overlap in cortical
activity associated with both visual imagery and perception (Zeidman
&amp; Maguire, 2016).</p>

<p>
While the standard view says that dreams are (or involve)
hallucinations, another way to make sense of the claim that dreaming
has the same phenomenal character as waking perception is to say that
dreams are illusory: they involve misperception of an external object
as having different properties than it actually has (cf. Smith 2002;
Crane &amp; French 2021). The illusion view disagrees with the
hallucination view on whether dreams have an appropriate and
contemporaneous external stimulus source.</p>

<p>
The illusion view has fallen out of favor but has a long history. It
has predecessors in the ancient belief that dreams have bodily sources
and that dream interpretation can thus be used to diagnose illness, as
practiced in the shrines at Epidaurus (Galen <em>On Diagnosis in
Dreams</em>; van de Castle 1994). Aristotle (<em>On Dreams</em>)
thought some dreams are caused by indigestion, and Hobbes adopted this
view, claiming different kinds of dreams could be traced to different
bodily sensations. For instance, &ldquo;lying cold breedeth Dreams of
Feare, and raiseth the thought and Image of some fearfull
object&rdquo; (Hobbes 1651: 91).</p>

<p>
Appeals to the bodily sources of dreaming became especially popular in
the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. These views
were extensively discussed and critiqued in Freud&rsquo;s (1899)
Interpretation of Dreams, which foregrounded the psychic sources of
dreaming. Some proponents of &ldquo;<em>Leibreiztheorie</em>&rdquo;
(or somatic-stimulus theory) of dreaming linked specific dream themes
such as flying to sleeping position (Macnish 1838; Scherner 1861; Vold
1910/1912; Ellis 1911) and realizing, in sleep, that one&rsquo;s feet
are not touching the ground (Bergson 1914). Others attempted to
explain the phenomenology of dreaming by appealing to the absence of
outward physical movement during sleep. The lack of appropriate
feedback and of movement and touch sensations was thought to cause
dreams of being unable to move (Bradley 1894) or of trying but failing
to do something (Gregory 1918). There were also early attempts to go
beyond anecdotal observations of a correspondence between dream
sensations and sleeping body by conducting controlled experiments to
pinpoint the causal contribution of sensory stimulation and changes in
room temperature, breathing, or sleeping position to dream experience
(Weygandt 1893, Schredl 2010 for details).</p>

<p>
More recently, attempts to systematically manipulate features of dream
experience have been discussed under the heading of dream engineering
(Carr et al. 2020). Such dream engineering techniques comprise various
kinds of sensory stimulation either before or during sleep. They are
often inspired by virtual reality technologies and additionally draw
from insights about external stimulus processing during different
sleep stages. Importantly, dream engineering recognizes the often
idiosyncratic and top-down sources of dream generation, including an
individual&rsquo;s previous experiences, memories, and biases.
According to Carr and colleagues (2021, p.3),</p>

<blockquote>
The dream emerges in a co-creative manner: real body sensation
contributes to dream generation just as individual experience shapes
dream narrative, which manifests in further body sensation, and so on,
completing the dreaming circuitry.
</blockquote>

<p>
In consequence, dream engineering focuses on manipulating simple
attributes of sleep and dreaming rather than attempting to control
entire dream narratives.</p>

<p>
Importantly, saying that dreams can be prompted by external stimuli
and that in some cases these are best described as illusions is
different from the stronger claim, sometimes advanced by historical
proponents of somatic-stimulus theory, that dreams <em>generally</em>
are caused by external or bodily stimuli. As an example of the
stronger claim, consider Wundt&rsquo;s proposal that the</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
ideas which arise in dreams come, at least to a great extent, from
sensations, especially from those of the general sense, and are
therefore mostly illusions of fancy, probably only seldom pure memory
ideas which hence become hallucinations. (Wundt 1896: 179)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Generally, it seems external and bodily stimuli can be related to
varying degrees to dream and sleep onset imagery (Nielsen 2017; Windt
2018; Windt et al. 2016). Some of these cases appear to fit the
standard concept of illusion, as when the sound of the alarm clock is
experienced, in a dream, as a siren, or when blood pressure cuff
inflation on the leg leads to dreams of wearing strange shoes (Windt
2018; for these and other examples, see Nielsen et al. 1995). In other
cases, such as when blood pressure cuff stimulation on the leg is
projected to another dream character, prompting a dream of seeing
someone else&rsquo;s leg being run over, describing this as illusory
misperception might be less straightforward.</p>

<p>
Such cases might illustrate the extent to which perceptual experience,
both in general and in dreaming in particular, is more varied than the
standard distinction between hallucinations and illusions allows.
Macpherson (2024) has recently argued that to make sense of the varied
nature of dream phenomena, we need to allow for further categories of
hallucination and illusion, allowing for a more nuanced distinction
between different perceptual, hallucinatory, and illusory phenomena in
dreams on the one hand, and variation in correspondence between dream
experience and external and bodily sources on the other hand. While
the traditional view contrasts property illusions (involving
misperception of the properties of a mind-independent object) with
hallucinations in which one has a seeming perception of an object
where no such mind-independent object is being perceived, Macpherson
proposes additional types of illusions and hallucinations, such as
property hallucinations in which a mind-independent object is
perceived but some of its properties are hallucinated. She notes that
her nuanced framework of illusions and hallucinations will allow for a
more precise description of the outcomes of dream engineering
attempts.</p>

<p>
In sum, it seems likely that appeals to external or bodily stimuli on
their own cannot fully explain dream imagery. Sensory incorporation in
dreams is often hard to predict and indirect; associated imagery seems
related not just to stimulus intensity, but also to short- and
long-term memories. Again, a full explanation of dream content
additionally has to take the cognitive and memory sources of dreaming
into account (Windt 2018; Nielsen 2017; cf. Silberer 1919).</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Imagination, dream imagery, and dream belief</h4>

<p>
The most important rival to the hallucination view is that dreams are
imaginings (for a general discussion of imagination, see Liao &amp;
Gendler 2020). This can mean that dream imagery involves imaginings
rather than percepts (including hallucinations or illusions; McGinn
2004), that (so-called) dream beliefs are imaginings and not real
instances of belief (Sosa 2007), or both (Ichikawa 2008, 2009). The
reasons for adopting the imagination view are diverse, and dreaming
has been proposed to resemble imagining along a number of dimensions
(e.g. McGinn 2004, 2005a,b; Thomas 2014). This issue is further
complicated by the fact that there is little agreement on the
definition of imagination and its relation to perception (Kind
2013).</p>

<p>
Generally, we can separate two questions: One, which mental states in
dreams count as real instances of their kind, and which are mere
imaginings? And two, how (if at all) does the ontological status of
dream experiences relate to other philosophical questions, in
including epistemological questions about dream deception?</p>

<p>
An important question for the imagination view is whether dreaming
involves presence or the feeling of being in a world, which many
believe is central to waking perception. Some imagination theorists
have compared the sense in which we feel present in dreams to
cognitive absorption, as when we are lost in a novel, film, or vivid
daydream (Sartre 1940; McGinn 2004; but see Hering 1947; Globus 1987).
Similarly, Soteriou (2024) proposes that when we dream, we represent a
spatiotemporal perspective relative to the dream environment and dream
persons and objects, but do not occupy this spatiotemporal perspective
in the same way as we do in waking. Others accept the central claim of
simulation views that dreams are immersive and involve the experience
of a self-in-a-world (Revonsuo 2006), but argue this is consistent
with dreams being imaginings (Thompson 2014, Lawson and Thompson
2024).</p>

<p>
Another question is whether dreams are subject to the will (Ichikawa
2009). This is important because imagination is often characterized as
active and under our control (Wittgenstein 1967: 621, 633), involving
&ldquo;a special effort of the mind&rdquo; (Descartes 1641: VI, 2),
whereas perception is thought to be passive (but see Thomas 2014 for
critical discussion). Because dreams seemingly happen to us, this
might seem to count against their being imaginings. Ichikawa (2009),
however, argues for a more nuanced view, in which lucid control dreams
show that dreams are generally subject to the will even where they are
not under our deliberate control.</p>

<p>
Recently, the imagination view has been assessed in light of growing
evidence on aphantasia. Aphantasia involves an often lifelong
impairment in imagery generation (Zeman et al. 2015, 2016).
Importantly, while subjects with aphantasia report an inability to
voluntarily generate imagery, they often still experience involuntary
imagery, including dreams (Dawes et al. 2020). According to Whiteley
(2021), the persistence of dreams in aphantasia is an empirical
counterargument to versions of the imagination view in which dreaming
involves an agential form of mental imagery, in the way suggested by
Ichikawa (2009). She argues that if dreams are imaginings, they must
involve a passive, non-agential form of imagination.</p>

<p>
As many philosophers have pointed out, the imagination view has
consequences for Cartesian dream skepticism. Many have pointed out
that if dream pain does not feel like real pain, one need only pinch
oneself to determine whether one is now dreaming (Nelson 1966; Stone
1984; but see Hodges &amp; Carter 1969; Kantor 1970). If one further
accepts the common assumption that imagined pain lacks the bite of
real pain, this could support the imagination view of dreaming. As
Locke put it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if our dreamer pleases to try, whether the glowing heat of a glass
furnace, be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man&rsquo;s
fancy, by putting his hand into it, he may perhaps be wakened into a
certainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than
bare imagination. (Locke 1689: IV.XI.8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For the faint-hearted, other tests might be available. Gregory (2024)
recently proposed that we can determine whether we are now perceiving
something in a particular sensory modality (as opposed to imagining
while awake or dreaming) by trying to imagine something in the same
sensory modality. This is because we cannot, it seems, have separate
imagistic experiences in the same sensory modality at the same time.
For instance, you cannot visually imagine, say, your office (the
keyboard on your desk, your computer screen, and the white wall behind
it) while also visually imagining a magical fairy-filled forest. By
contrast, you can visually perceive your current surroundings while
visually imagining a scene. This limitation on imagination (and
dreaming, if the imagination view of dreaming is correct) is related
to the alleged attention-dependence of dreaming, or the idea that
dream experience is exhausted by what is the focus of selective
attention and has no foreground-background structure (Hunter 1983;
Thompson 2014).</p>

<p>
If dream imagery involves imagining as opposed to quasi-perception,
this raises the question why we tend to describe dreams in the same
terms as waking perception. Maybe this is because most people have not
thought deeply about such ontological questions but would find the
imagination view plausible if they considered it (Ichikawa 2009). Or
maybe</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is just because we all know that dreams are <em>throughout
un</em>like waking experiences that we can safely use ordinary
expressions in the narration of them. (Austin 1962: 42)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The philosophical discussion on the imagination view is complemented
by and often draws from cognitive theories of dreaming. Foulkes (1978:
5) describes dreaming as a form of thinking with its own grammar and
syntax, but allows that dream imagery is sufficiently perception-like
to deceive us. Domhoff&rsquo;s <em>neurocognitive model of
dreaming</em> (2001, 2003) emphasizes the dependence of dreaming on
visuospatial skills and on a network including the association areas
of the forebrain. The theory draws from findings on the partial or
global cessation of dreaming following brain lesions (cf. Solms 1997,
2000), evidence that dreaming develops gradually and in tandem with
visuospatial skills in children (Foulkes 1993a, 1999; but see Resnick
et al. 1994), and results from dream content analysis supporting the
continuity of dreaming with waking concerns and memories (the
so-called <em>continuity hypothesis</em>; see Domhoff 2001, 2003;
Schredl &amp; Hofmann 2003; Schredl 2006; see also Nir &amp; Tononi
2010).</p>

<p>
Aside from questions about the relationship between dream imagery,
sensory imagination, and percepts, some versions of the imagination
view argue that so-called dream beliefs are not real beliefs, but
propositional imaginings (here, for ease of reading, I use the term
&ldquo;dream belief&rdquo;, but note that whether these count as real
beliefs is precisely the issue at hand). Again, this latter question
is complicated by the fact that different accounts of belief exist.
Also, the debate about dream beliefs is paralleled by a debate about
whether delusions are beliefs or imaginings (see Currie 2000; Currie
&amp; Ravenscroft 2002; McGinn 2004; Bayne &amp; Pacherie 2005;
Bortolotti 2009). Both debates might plausibly inform each other,
especially as dreams are sometimes proposed to be delusional (Hobson
1999).</p>

<p>
Ichikawa (2009) argues that dream beliefs lack connection with
perceptual experience and fail to motivate actions; consequently,
dream beliefs do not play the same functional role as real beliefs.
Moreover, we cannot ascribe dream beliefs to a person by observing
them lying asleep in bed. Dream beliefs are often inconsistent with
longstanding waking beliefs and acquired and discarded without any
process of belief revision (Ichikawa 2009). He concludes that if we
adopt interpretationist or dispositionalist accounts of belief, dream
beliefs fall short of real beliefs.</p>

<p>
As is the case for dream imagery, the analysis of dream beliefs has
consequences for skepticism. If dream beliefs are propositional
imaginings, then we do not falsely believe while dreaming that we are
now awake, but only imagine that we do (Sosa 2007). It is not clear,
however, that this protects us from deception: in mistaking dream
beliefs for the real thing, we would now be deceived about the status
of our own mental states (Ichikawa 2008).</p>

<p>
It is also not clear whether the same type of argument extends to
mental states other than beliefs. As Lewis points out, a person
might</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in fact believe or realize in the course of a dream that he was
dreaming, and even if we said that, in such case, he only dreamt that
he was dreaming, this still leaves it possible for someone who is
asleep to entertain at the time the thought that he is asleep. (Lewis
1969: 133)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mental states other than believing such as entertaining, thinking, or
minimally appraisive instances of taking for granted might be
sufficient for deception (Reed 1979).</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Dreaming, daydreaming, and waking mind wandering</h4>

<p>
A number of researchers have begun to consider dreaming in relation to
mind wandering. Mind wandering is frequent in wakefulness and involves
thoughts and attention drifting away from ongoing tasks and/or the
here and now. Mind wandering has been variously defined (Seli et al.
2018; Christoff et al. 2018; Irving &amp; Glasser 2020) and different
constructs such as task-unrelated thought, stimulus-independent
thought, or freely moving thoughts plausibly refer to different
phenomena (Smallwood &amp; Schooler 2015; Christoff et al. 2016).</p>

<p>
Based on phenomenological and neurophysiological similarities, dreams
have been proposed to be an intensified form of waking mind wandering
(Domhoff 2011; Wamsley 2013; Fox et al. 2013). The Dynamic Framework
(Christoff et al. 2016) places dreaming on a continuum with mind
wandering and posits that both are distinguished by progressively
weaker deliberate constraints as compared to focused attention in
wakefulness. Similarly, hallucinations have been suggested to be an
intensified form of mind wandering, partly based on their similarity
with REM sleep dreaming (Fazekas 2021).</p>

<p>
In the context of mental agency, Metzinger (2013a,b, 2015) describes
dreams and waking mind wandering as involving a cyclically recurring
loss of mental autonomy, or the ability to deliberately control
one&rsquo;s conscious thought processes. In this view, dreams and
waking mind wandering are not mental actions but unintentional mental
behaviors. By contrast, Windt and Voss (2018) use the example of lucid
control dreams, where dreamers realize they are dreaming and can exert
some degree of control over the unfolding dream, to propose that
spontaneous processes including imagery formation can co-exist
alongside more deliberate, top-down control; they also argue that
metacognitive insight and control themselves can have spontaneous
elements.</p>

<p>
The discussion of dreaming and mind wandering has also been used to
reconsider how we think about the behavioral states of sleep and
wakefulness in relation to conscious experience. Traditionally, it has
often been assumed that the contrast between behavioral states is
reflected in a contrast in associated conscious states, such that
dreaming, as sleep-related experience, is sharply distinguished from
waking consciousness. The alleged continuity between dreaming and
waking mind wandering, however, casts doubt on this idea. Windt (2020)
argues that if we take a broad view of both the range of sleep-related
experiences and of waking mind wandering, we find plausible examples
of the same kinds of mental state occurring in sleep and wakefulness.
In other cases, sleep-related experiences may indeed be intensified
along certain dimensions compared to waking mind wandering. In a
similar vein, Kirberg (2022) argues that bizarreness, which has often
been considered as unique to dreaming, is in fact frequent in waking
mind wandering as well. Moreover, where bizarreness has often been
regarded as an example of the cognitive deficiency that allegedly
marks dreaming, Kirberg proposes that it is an expression of
spontaneous, associative, and weakly constrained thought.</p>

<p>
Lawson and Thompson (2024) draw from theoretical proposals and
empirical findings to present a careful phenomenological analysis of
daydreaming in contrast to mind wandering, waking imagination, and
night-dreaming. They argue that daydreaming involves a particular type
of spontaneous, immersive imagination in wakefulness, which is
distinguished to different degrees from other spontaneous thoughts and
experiences as well as from waking imagination. In their view,
daydreams arise spontaneously in the relative absence of deliberate
guidance, making them similar to mind wandering in some respects. Yet,
daydreams exhibit greater dynamic stability as well as greater
narrative and affective salience than mind wandering, and in this
regard more strongly resemble more immersive night-dreams.</p>

<p>
Moving forward, an important challenge is to more precisely describe
the relationship not just between different kinds of spontaneous
thoughts in waking and sleep, but also to work towards an integrated
account of different kinds of mind wandering and imagination. Care
should be taken to distinguish mind wandering from imagining. Not all
mind wandering (such thoughts drifting, during an important meeting,
to your grocery shopping list) involves imagining; and conversely,
e.g. deliberate or task-oriented sensory imagining would not count as
mind wandering. Making sense of the relationship between mind
wandering and imagination by working towards a nuanced view stands to
inform debates on the ontology of dreaming, and vice versa.</p>

<h4>2.2.4 Dreaming, memory, and dream reports</h4>

<p>
Recently, there has been a flurry of renewed interest in the
relationship between dreaming, memory, and dream reports. Three types
of question can be distinguished (Gregory &amp; Michaelian 2024b):
One, how we remember and report our dreams; two, the status of memory
within dreams; and three, the broader comparison between dreaming and
remembering, and between dream and waking memory reports.</p>

<p>
The first question about how we remember our dreams&mdash;and indeed
whether dream recall is a form of memory at all&mdash;relates closely
to the debate about dream experience initiated by Malcolm (1956, 1959)
following the discovery of REM sleep. On the side of skepticism, we
have the idea that dream reports are not memory reports at all: dreams
are not, in this view, experiences, and so reporting a dream is not a
genuine instance of reporting or remembering past experiences during
sleep (Malcolm 1959). A slightly different position is to deny that
dream recall has evidential status with respect to dreams and whether
dreams are experiences needs to be decided by independent means
(Dennett 1976).</p>

<p>
Another family of views allows that dreams (or at least some dreams;
Rosen 2024) are experiences, but distrusts dream reports. Rosen (2013)
has defended a narrative fabrication view of dream reports, and
Copenhaver (2024) has argued that even when we have a memory
experience of having dreamed of an event that actually happened, this
does not count as a memory: Because dreams do not acquaint us with the
objects, properties, persons, and events they represent, our memory
experiences of having dreamt are, at best, veridical confabulations.
Finally, Schwitzgebel (2002, 2011) has used a historical shift in
scientific opinion about whether we dream in color or in
black-and-white to argue that our opinions about dreams can be quite
radically mistaken.</p>

<p>
On the side of anti-skepticism, we have the idea that dream reports,
at least under certain conditions (such as following timed awakenings
in the laboratory), are trustworthy sources of evidence about
preceding dream experiences (Windt 2013). The question of whether to
trust dream reports then turns into a set of questions about how best
to gather and analyse dream reports, how to deal with potentially
different results from different methods, and how detailed interviews
might enable more precise understanding of dream phenomenology
(Dem&scaron;ar &amp; Windt 2024).</p>

<p>
Yet another perspective is how to think about dream recall itself.
Crespin and Rosen (2025) point out that whether dream recall is good
or bad depends on what we compare it to&mdash;and the answer might be
different not just for dreams from different sleep stages, but also
for whether we compare dream recall to recall of waking perception on
the one hand or recall of mind wandering and/or imagination on the
other hand. Sant&rsquo;Anna (2024) identifies a broader asymmetry in
how we remember dreams and waking experiences: While waking experience
reports are based on introspection of the relevant experiences, dream
reports are based on introspection not of dreams themselves, but of
dream memories. He further argues that recognizing the role of
metacognition in dreams suggests an account in which dreaming is
related to mind wandering. Finally, Nemeth (2023) points out that
dream recall is in fact a complex construct, spanning dream production
or generation, encoding, and retrieval, leading to a report. She
identifies a complex web of factors that have been proposed to explain
differences in dream recall frequency in different studies and for
different participant groups.</p>

<p>
The second big question concerns the status of memories within dreams.
James (2024) asks how to make sense of dreams that seem to connect us
to external-world particulars&mdash;such as a particular person in our
lives&mdash;arguing that such cases are at least partially a matter of
remembering those particulars. Drawing from philosophical work on
episodic memory, Gregory (2024b) asks about the possibility of
episodic memory in dreams. He suggests that allowing for episodic
memories to be possible in nonlucid dreams entails commitment to
assumptions that are likely too strong, including about our ability to
make judgments about the past to retain a high degree of rationality
in dreams.</p>

<p>
This discussion stands alongside a large body of empirical work on the
relationship between memory, different sleep stages, and dreams. This
includes questions about episodic memory in dreams (Fosse et al.
2003), the waking memory sources of dreaming and the temporal pattern
of their integration (Nielsen &amp; Powell 1989; Eichenlaub et al.
2019), and whether targeted memory activation in dreams can support
memory consolidation and learning after sleep (Picard-Deland &amp;
Nielsen 2022; Carr et al. 2020).</p>

<p>
The third major question concerns the broader comparison of dreaming
and memory. Bernecker (2024) argues that while dreams are imaginings,
they are distinct from memory imaginings (or imaginings that qualify
as memory) in that the latter are produced by a mechanism whose proper
function it is to track the truth. Barkasi (2024) examines the feeling
of pastness that typically accompanies episodic memories and argues
that a similar feeling of pastness can occur in some dreams, though
with subtle phenomenological differences insofar as dreams, unlike
episodic memories, are immersive.</p>

<p>
Other authors reflect more broadly on what dream recall tells us about
memory, including different theories of memory (such as intentionalism
and relationalism; Werning &amp; Liefke 2024, 2025) and the accuracy
of memory (Michaelian 2024, McCarroll et al. 2024).</p>

<p>
Sutton (2024) examines Halbwachs&rsquo;s treatment of dreaming in the
context of memory. Halbwachs endorsed an anti-individualist account in
which remembering is intrinsically social. The contrast with dreaming,
in which consciousness is left to its own devices, sharpens this
account. Dreaming, according to Halbwachs, resembles children&rsquo;s
memories insofar as the dreamer, similar to a small child, is
temporarily outside of the social realm. Sutton makes this historical
position accessible and relates it to contemporary dream research and
work on distributed and 4E cognition. Finally, Dranseika (2024)
reports the results of a study investigating folk beliefs about
phenomenological similarities and differences between dreaming,
remembering, perceiving, imagining, and hallucinating to suggest how
experimental philosophy can contribute to debates on the comparison
between these mental states. For example, such results can shed light
on the psychological appeal of philosophical positions such as
Cartesian dream skepticism, the imagination vs the quasi-perceptual
view of dreaming, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="DreaSleeCons">3. Dreaming, sleep, and consciousness</h2>

<h3 id="DreaScieCons">3.1 Dreaming and the science of consciousness</h3>

<p>
Dreaming is commonly described as a spontaneously and regularly
occurring global state of consciousness in which experience arises
under altered behavioral and neurophysiological conditions as compared
to standard wakefulness. Because dreaming is plausibly the most
widespread altered state of consciousness, many regard dreams as a
model system for consciousness research (Churchland 1988; Revonsuo
2006). As Revonsuo puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the dreaming brain brings out the phenomenal level of organization in
a clear and distinct form. Dreaming is phenomenality pure and simple,
untouched by external physical stimulation or behavioural activity.
(Revonsuo 2006: 75)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to the &ldquo;world-simulation metaphor of
consciousness&rdquo;, dreaming reveals the basic, state-independent
structure of consciousness to be immersive: &ldquo;dreaming depicts
consciousness first and foremost as a subjective
world-<em>for-me</em>&rdquo; (Revonsuo 2006: 75), suggesting that
consciousness itself is essentially simulational and dreamlike (see
also Metzinger 2003).</p>

<p>
The idea that dreaming is functionally a state of cranial envatment
that nonetheless simulates the phenomenology of waking perceptual
experience has often been regarded as supporting internalism about
conscious experience, whereas dreaming has been thought to be a
counter-example to externalist or enactivist account (Revonsuo 2006).
Yet things may be more complex. A possible defense of enactivism is to
say that dreaming does not in fact replicate the detail and stability
of waking perceptual experience (but see Rosen 2021) and these
phenomenological differences result from the lack of dynamic
interaction with the environment in dreams (No&euml; 2004). Another is
that dream experience is exhausted by what is in phenomenal experience
at any given moment, whereas the phenomenology of waking perception
includes what is accessible via sensorimotor exploration (Barkasi
2021b). Yet another is to acknowledge the variability of dream
experience, which ranges from more to less detailed, stable, and
vivid, as well as more to less cut off from the environment and
sleeping body &mdash; though how this impacts the challenge dreams
pose for enactivism is controversial (Rosen 2018a, Windt 2018).
Finally, Windt (2018) has argued that the idea that dream experience
is isolated from sensory input and motor output is itself problematic:
dreams are not cranially envatted, but weakly embodied states of
consciousness.</p>

<p>
Others have cautioned against regarding dreaming as model system for
consciousness research. One concern is that in the absence of a well
worked out theory of dreaming and its sleep-stage and neural
correlates, proposals for using dreaming as a model system risk
relying on an oversimplified description of the target phenomenon
(Windt &amp; Noreika 2011). Another is that because of the
unreliability of dream reports, and because dreaming cannot be easily
or directly induced, dreaming cannot be operationalized as
straightforwardly as e.g. visual experience in wakefulness (Carruthers
et al. 2019; though lucid dreams might be a counterexample, see also
Baird et al. 2019).</p>

<p>
Dreaming has also been suggested as a model system not just of waking
consciousness in general, but of psychotic wake states in particular.
The analogy between dreaming and madness has a long philosophical
history (Plato, <em>Phaedrus</em>; Kant 1766; Schopenhauer 1847).
Hobson famously claimed that &ldquo;dreaming is not a model of a
psychosis. It is a psychosis. It&rsquo;s just a healthy one&rdquo;
(Hobson 1999: 44). Gottesmann (2006) proposes dreaming as a
neurophysiological model of schizophrenia. There is a rich discussion
on the theoretical and methodological implications of dream research
for psychiatry (see Scarone et al. 2007; d&rsquo;Agostino et al. 2013;
see Windt &amp; Noreika 2011) and a number of studies have
investigated differences in dream reports from schizophrenic and
healthy subjects (Limosani et al. 2011a,b). There have also been
attempts to compare specific dream phenomena to wake-state delusions
such as character misidentification and delusions of hyperfamiliarity
(such as the Fr&eacute;goli delusion, in which strangers are
mistakenly identified as family members, and <em>d&eacute;j&agrave;
vu</em>; see Gerrans 2012, 2013, 2014), but also thought insertion and
auditory hallucinations (Rosen 2015).</p>

<p>
Predictive processing accounts (Clark 2013b; Hohwy 2013) suggest a
unified account of perception, imagination, and dreaming. In these
accounts, different mental states, including perception and action,
involve different strategies of hypothesis testing and prediction
error minimization. Perception is the attempt to model the hidden
external causes of sensory stimuli; action involves keeping the
internal model stable while changing the sensory input. Clark argues
that on such a model,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
systems that know how to perceive an object as a cat are thus systems
that, <em>ipso facto</em>, are able to use a top-down cascade to bring
about the kinds of activity pattern that would be characteristic of
the presence of a cat. [&hellip;] Perceivers like us, if this is
correct, are inevitably potential dreamers and imaginers too.
Moreover, they are beings who, in dreaming and imagining, are
deploying many of the very same strategies and resources used in
ordinary perception. (Clark 2013a: 764)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Predictive processing accounts have also been used to explain specific
features of dreaming such as bizarreness (Hobson &amp; Friston 2012;
Fletcher &amp; Frith 2008; Bucci &amp; Grasso 2017) and bodily
self-experience (Windt 2018).</p>

<p>
Dreams have also been suggested as a test case for whether phenomenal
consciousness can be divorced from cognitive access (e.g., Block 2007;
but see Cohen &amp; Dennett 2011). Sebasti&aacute;n (2014a) argues
that dreams provide empirical evidence that conscious experience can
occur independently of cognitive access. This is because during
(non-lucid) REM-sleep dreams, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC) as the most plausible mechanism underlying cognitive access is
selectively deactivated (see also Pantani et al. 2018). While this
would, if further substantiated, challenge theories linking conscious
experience to access, such as higher-order-thought theory
(Sebasti&aacute;n 2014b), both the hypoactivation of the dlPCF in REM
sleep and its association with cognitive access have been debated.
Fazekas and Nemeth (2018) suggest that certain kinds of cognitive
access may be independent of dlPFC activation, necessitating a more
complex account. Rosen&rsquo;s (2024a) pluralism suggests variability
in the extent to which phenomenal and access consciousness are
expressed in dreams.</p>

<h3 id="DreaSlee">3.2 Dreamless sleep</h3>

<p>
In recent years there has been a surge of interest in the possibility
of dreamless sleep experience and foundational issues about the
definition of sleep and waking (Thompson 2014, 2015). This has been
paralleled by growing interest in dreams occurring in NREM sleep.</p>

<p>
Conceptually, interest in dreamless sleep experience has been
facilitated by the precise definition of dreaming offered by
simulation views (Revonsuo et al. 2015). If dreams are immersive sleep
experiences characterized by their <em>here</em>-and-<em>now</em>
structure, it makes sense to ask whether this is true for all or just
a subset of sleep-related experiences and whether non-immersive sleep
experiences exist. By contrast, if dreaming is broadly identified with
any conscious mentation in sleep (Pagel et al. 2001), there is no
conceptual space for dreamless sleep experience.</p>

<p>
This work is relevant beyond sleep and dreaming for definitions of
consciousness: In light of dreamless sleep experience, operational
definitions of consciousness as that which disappears in deep,
dreamless sleep and reappears in waking and dreaming (Searle 2000;
Tononi 2008) are problematic and require revision (Thompson 2014,
2015). Dreamless sleep experience has been proposed to be particularly
relevant for understanding minimal phenomenal experience, or the
conditions under which the simplest kind of conscious experience
arises (Windt 2015b).</p>

<p>
Following Thompson&rsquo;s (2014, 2015) discussion of dreamless sleep
in Indian and Buddhist philosophy, Windt and colleagues (2016; see
also Windt 2015b) introduce a framework for different kinds of
(non-immersive) dreamless sleep experience ranging from thinking and
isolated imagery, perception, or bodily sensations, where these lack
integration into a scene, to minimal kinds of experience lacking
imagery or specific thought contents. A possible example of minimal
phenomenal experience in sleep are white dreams, where people report
having had experiences during sleep but cannot remember any details.
Taken at face value, some white dream reports might describe
experiences that lack reportable content (Windt 2015b); others might
describe forgotten dreams or dreams with degraded content (Fazekas et
al. 2018). Another example are reports of witnessing dreamless sleep,
as described in certain meditation practices. This state is said to
involve non-conceptual awareness of sleep, again in the absence of
imagery or specific thought contents, and loss of sense of self
(Thompson 2014, 2015). There have also been attempts to study
allegedly objectless or contentless sleep experience empirically
(Alcaraz-S&aacute;nchez 2023, Alcaraz-S&aacute;nchez et al. 2022) and
compare it to lucid dreams (Alcaraz-S&aacute;nchez 2024a), mind
blanking, advanced meditative states (Andrillon et al. 2025), and
other states of minimal awareness in waking and sleep
(Alcaraz-S&aacute;nchez 2024b).</p>

<p>
Interest in dreamless sleep experience is paralleled by increasing
interest in experiences in NREM sleep. Most researchers now accept
that dreaming is not confined to REM sleep, but also occurs at sleep
onset and in NREM sleep. The deeper stages of NREM sleep are
particularly interesting as they involve roughly similar proportions
of dreaming, unconscious sleep, and white dreams (Noreika et al. 2009:
Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). In the search for the neural correlates of
dreaming vs unconscious dreamless sleep, this makes comparisons within
the same sleep stage possible and avoids confounds involved in
comparing presumably dreamful REM sleep with presumably dreamless NREM
sleep. Findings suggest that activity in the same parietal hot zone
underlies dreaming in both NREM and REM sleep (Siclari et al.
2017).</p>

<p>
Finally, while sleep and sleep stages have traditionally been regarded
as global, whole-brain phenomena, there is now increasing evidence
that sleep itself is locally driven, and local changes in sleep depth
might be associated with changes in sleep-related experience (Siclari
&amp; Tononi 2017; Andrillon et al. 2019). While sleep and wakefulness
have traditionally, following Aristotle, been regarded as opposites
(<em>On Sleeping and Waking</em>; see also Kroker 2007), recognition
that sleep-like activity can occur in an otherwise wakeful brain, and
vice versa, requires a shift in how we operationalize sleep and
wakefulness in relation to different conscious states (Windt
2020a).</p>

<h2 id="DreaSelf">4. Dreaming and the self</h2>

<p>
The self is almost always present in dreams, though in our dreams, we
can have the experience of being a slightly different (e.g. older or
younger) version of our waking self or even a different person
entirely (Rosen &amp; Sutton 2013). Dreams therefore raise interesting
questions about the identity between the dream and waking self. Locke
(1689: II.I.12) invites us to imagine two men alternating in turns
between sleep and wakefulness and sharing one continuously thinking
soul. He argues that if one man retained no memory of the soul&rsquo;s
thoughts and perceptions while it was linked to the other man&rsquo;s
body, they would be distinct persons.</p>

<p>
Valberg (2007) distinguishes between the subject of the dream (i.e.,
the dream self) and the sleeping person who is the dreamer of the
dream and recalls it upon awakening. He argues that awakening from a
dream involves crossing a chasm between discrete worlds with discrete
spaces and times; it does not make sense to say that &ldquo;the
&lsquo;I&rsquo; at these times [is] a single individual who crosses
from one world to the other&rdquo; (Valberg 2007: 69). He proposes
this is relevant to dream skepticism because there is no simple way to
make sense of the claims that it is I who emerge from a dream or that
I was the victim of dream deception.</p>

<p>
Vicarious dreams, or dreams in which the protagonist of the dream
seems to be a different person from the dreamer, are particularly
puzzling with respect to identity. They may even raise the question of
whether the dream self has an independent existence (Rosen &amp;
Sutton 2013: 1047). Such dreams are superficially similar to cases in
which we imagine being another person, but according to Rosen and
Sutton require a different explanation: in the case of dreaming, the
imagined person&rsquo;s thoughts are not framed as diverging from
one&rsquo;s own and one does not retain one&rsquo;s own perspective in
addition to the imagined one; in nonlucid dreams, only the perspective
of the dream&rsquo;s protagonist is retained.</p>

<p>
The dream self is also at the center of simulation views of dreaming,
which define dreaming via its immersive, here-and-now character as the
experience of a self in a world. This leads to further questions about
the phenomenology of self-experience in dreams and how it is different
from waking self-experience. Different versions of the simulation view
focus on different aspects of self- and world experience in dreams,
ranging from social simulation (Revonsuo et al. 2015) to the typical
features of selfhood in dreams (Revonsuo 2005, 2006, Metzinger 2003,
2009) to the minimal conditions for experiencing oneself as a self in
dreams and what this tells us about minimal phenomenal selfhood in
general (Windt 2015a, 2018). Yet these different versions of the
simulation view are largely complementary and together have forged
unity in a field that was previously hampered by lack of agreement
about the definition of dreaming. They also integrate the philosophy
of dreaming and scientific dream research.</p>

<p>
As so often in debates about dreaming, there is disagreement about
basic phenomenological questions. Revonsuo (2005) describes
self-experience including bodily experience in dreams as identical to
waking, whereas Metzinger (2003, 2009; see also Windt &amp; Metzinger
2007) argues that important layers of waking self-experience (such as
autobiographical memory, agency, a stable first-person perspective,
metacognitive insight, and self-knowledge) are missing in nonlucid
dreams. Windt (2015a, 2018) has argued that bodily self-experience in
dreams is both more variable and typically more weakly expressed than
in waking, due in part to changes in the processing of environmental
and own-body stimuli in sleep. She proposes that the analysis of
bodily self-experience in dreams has implications for minimal
phenomenal selfhood (Blanke &amp; Metzinger 2009; see also Metzinger
2013b), showing that it is tied to spatiotemporal-self-location in the
absence of body ownership (Windt 2010). Finally, Barkasi (2021a) has
proposed that dreams only partly involve the feeling of presence.
Specifically, dreams involve immersive presence but not motor
presence, as this is tied to motion-guiding vision which is offline
during sleep.</p>

<p>
How the phenomenology of dreaming compares to waking and how the dream
self relates to the waking self also bears on questions about the
moral status of dreams. For Augustine (<em>Confessions</em>), dreams
were a cause of moral concern because of their indistinguishability
from waking life. Of particular concern were the vividness of dreams
of sexual acts, as well as the feelings of pleasure and seeming
acquiescence or consent on the part of the dreamer associated with
such dreams. Augustine argued, however, that the transition from sleep
to wakefulness involves a chasm, enabling dreamers to awaken with a
clear conscience and absolving them from responsibility for their
dream actions (see Matthews 1981 for critical discussion).</p>

<p>
More broadly, the issue of dream immorality may be a choice point
between different accounts of moral evaluation. Where internalists
assume the moral status of a person&rsquo;s actions is entirely
determined by factors such as intentions and motives, externalists
look beyond these to the effects of actions. Driver (2007) argues that
the intuitive absurdity of dream immorality itself should count
against purely internalist accounts; yet she also acknowledges this
absurdity is not a necessary feature of dreams.</p>

<h2 id="MeanFuncDrea">5. The meaning and functions of dreams</h2>

<p>
Traditionally, a main source of interest in dreams has been dream
interpretation and whether dreams are a source of knowledge and
insight. Historically, the epistemic status of dreams and the use of
prophetic and diagnostic dreams was not just a theoretical, but a
practical problem (Barbera 2008). Different types of dreams were
distinguished by their putative epistemic value. Artemidorus (1975),
for instance, used the term <em>enhypnion</em> to refer to dreams that
merely reflect the sleeper&rsquo;s current bodily or psychological
state and hence do not merit further interpretation, whereas he
reserved the term <em>oneiron</em> for meaningful and symbolic dreams
of divine origin.</p>

<p>
The practice of dream interpretation was famously criticized by
Aristotle in <em>On Prophecy in Sleep</em>. He denied that dreams are
of divine origin, but allowed that occasionally, small affections of
the sensory organs may stem from distant events that cannot be
perceived in waking but yet are perceptible in the quiet of sleep. He
also believed such dreams were mostly likely to occur in dullards
whose minds resemble an empty desert &ndash; an assessment that was
not apt to encourage interest in dreams (Kroker 2007: 37). A similarly
negative view was held by early modern philosophers who believed
dreams were often the source of superstitious beliefs and akin to
madness (Hobbes 1651; Kant 1766; Schopenhauer 1847).</p>

<p>
Freudian dream theory considered dream interpretation as the royal
road to knowledge of the unconscious. This was associated with claims
about the psychic sources of dreaming. Freud (1899) also rejected the
influence of external or bodily sources, as championed by contemporary
proponents of somatic-stimulus theory.</p>

<p>
The Freudian view of dream meaning was famously and radically opposed
by Hobson&rsquo;s (1988) claim that dreams are the product of random,
brain-stem driven activation of the brain during sleep and at best
enable personal insights in the same way as a Rorschach test (Hobson
et al. 2000). Dennett (1991) illustrates the lack of design underlying
the production of dream narratives through the &ldquo;party game of
psychoanalysis&rdquo;, which involves an aimless game of
question-and-answer. In the game, players follow simple rules to
jointly produce narratives that can seem symbolic and meaningful, even
though no intelligent and deliberate process of narration was
involved.</p>

<p>
Historically, views on the epistemic status of dreams and the type of
knowledge to be gained from dream interpretation (e.g., knowledge
about the future, diagnosis of physical illness, or insights about
one&rsquo;s current concerns) often changed in tandem with views on
the origin and sources of dreaming, which gradually moved from divine
origins and external sources, via the body, to the unconscious, and
finally to the brain.</p>

<p>
Indeed, the discussion of evolutionary functions of dreaming is
closely tied to discussion of the functions of sleep and different
sleep stages. Importantly, given that dreams occur in all stages of
sleep, a theory on the function of dreaming has to be separate from a
theory on the function of different sleep stages. Moreover, if
dreaming is continuous, say, with waking mind wandering, this suggests
that a unified account of their respective functions is required.
Dreaming might not then have a distinctive function. It is also
possible that different dreams and sleep-related experiences fulfill
different functions to varying degrees (Windt 2015a).</p>

<p>
Prominent theories on the function of dreaming focus on bad dreams and
nightmares. It has long been thought that dreaming contributes to
emotional processing and that this is particularly obvious in the
dreams of nightmare sufferers or in dreams following traumatic
experiences (e.g., Hartmann 1998; Nielsen &amp; Lara-Carrasco 2007;
Levin &amp; Nielsen 2009; Cartwright 2010; Perogamvros et al. 2013).
Based on the high prevalence of negative emotions and threatening
dream content, threat simulation theory suggests that the evolutionary
function of dreaming lies in the simulation of ancestral threats and
the rehearsal of threatening events and avoidance skills in dreams has
an adaptive value by enhancing the individual&rsquo;s chances of
survival (see Revonsuo 2000; Valli 2008). Another proposal is social
simulation theory, in which social imagery in dreams supports social
cognition, bonds, and social skills. (Revonsuo et al. 2015; see also
Tuominen et al. 2019).</p>

<p>
An evolutionary perspective has also been applied to specific aspects
of dream phenomenology. According to the <em>vigilance
hypothesis</em>, natural selection disfavored the occurrence of those
types of sensations during sleep that would compromise vigilance
(Symons 1993). Dream sounds, but also smells or pains might distract
attention from the potentially dangerous surroundings of the sleeping
subject, and the vigilance hypothesis predicts that they only rarely
occur in dreams without causing awakening. By contrast, because most
mammals sleep with their eyes closed and in an immobile position,
vivid visual and motor experiences during sleep would not comprise
vigilance and thus can occur in dreams without endangering the
sleeping subject. Focusing on the stuff dreams are <em>not</em> made
of might then be at least as important for understanding the function
of dreaming as developing a positive account (Symons 1993).</p>

<p>
Finally, even if dreaming in general and specific types of dream
content in particular were found to be strongly associated with
specific cognitive functions, it would still be possible that dreams
are mere epiphenomena of brain activity during sleep (Flanagan 1995,
2000). A particular challenge for any theory on the function of
dreaming is to explain why a majority of dreams are forgotten and how
dreams can fulfill their putative function independently of recall.
Crick and Mitchinson (1983) famously proposed that REM sleep
&ldquo;erases&rdquo; or deletes surplus information and unnecessary
memories, which would suggest that enhanced dream recall is
counterproductive. A related challenge is that dreaming can be lost
selectively and independently of other cognitive deficits (Solms 1997,
2000).</p>

<h2 id="Conc">6. Conclusions</h2>

<p>
Philosophical questions about dreaming from epistemology, ontology,
philosophy of mind and cognitive science, as well as ethics are
closely intertwined. Scientific evidence from sleep and dream research
can meaningfully inform the philosophical discussion of sleep and
dreaming and has often done so in the past. The discussion of dreaming
has also often functioned as a lens on broader questions about
knowledge, morality, consciousness, and self. Long a marginalized
area, the philosophy of dreaming and of sleep is central to a range of
philosophical questions and increasingly plays an important role in
interdisciplinary consciousness research, for example in the search
for neural basis of consciousness, in conscious state taxonomies, in
research on the minimal conditions for phenomenal selfhood and
conscious experience, as well as in research on dreaming in relation
to waking mind wandering, imagination, and daydreaming.</p>
