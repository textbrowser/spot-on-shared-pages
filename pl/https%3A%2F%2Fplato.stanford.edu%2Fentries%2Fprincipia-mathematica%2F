This entry briefly describes the history and significance of Alfred
North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s monumental but little
read classic of symbolic logic, <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (PM),
first published in 1910&ndash;1913. The content of PM is described in
a section-by-section synopsis, stated in modernized logical notation
and described following the introductory notes from each of the three
volumes. The original notation is presented in a companion article of
this Encyclopedia,
 <a href="../pm-notation/"><em>The Notation of Principia Mathematica</em></a>.
 The content of PM is described so as to facilitate a comparison with
Gottlob Frege&rsquo;s <em>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</em>, which was
subject to Russell&rsquo;s Paradox. To avoid the paradox Whitehead and
Russell introduced a complex system now called &ldquo;the ramified
theory of types&rdquo;. After the introduction of a theory of
sets or &ldquo;classes&rdquo; early in the first volume, however,
the system of PM can be compared with both Frege and the early
development of set theory and found to contain rival accounts, free of
contradiction, but differing from the now standard theories in as yet
understudied ways.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Over">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, the landmark work in formal logic
written by
 <a href="../whitehead/">Alfred North Whitehead</a>
 and
 <a href="../russell/">Bertrand Russell</a>,
 was first published in three volumes in 1910, 1912 and 1913. A second
edition appeared in 1925 (Volume I) and 1927 (Volumes II and III). In
1962 an abbreviated issue (containing only the first 56 chapters)
appeared in paperback.</p>

<p>
Written as a defense of <em>logicism</em> (the thesis that mathematics
is in some significant sense reducible to logic), the book was
instrumental in developing and popularizing modern mathematical logic.
It also served as a major impetus for research in the foundations of
mathematics throughout the twentieth century. Along with
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Organon</em> and Gottlob Frege&rsquo;s <em>Basic
Laws of Arithmetic</em>, it remains one of the most influential books
on logic ever written.</p>

<p>
This entry includes a presentation of the main definitions and
theorems used in the development of the logicist project in PM. The
entry indicates a path through the whole work presenting the basic
results proved in a somewhat more contemporary notation, so as to make
it easy to compare the system of Whitehead and Russell with that of
Frege, the other most prominent advocate of logicism in the
foundations of mathematics. The aim of that program, as described by
Russell in the opening lines of the preface to his 1903 book <em>The
Principles of Mathematics</em>, was to define mathematical notions in
terms of logical notions, and to derive mathematical principles, so
defined, from logical principles alone:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The present work has two main objects. One of these, the proof that
all pure mathematics deals exclusively with concepts definable in
terms of a very small number of fundamental concepts, and that all its
propositions are deducible from a very small number of fundamental
logical principles, is undertaken in Parts II&ndash;VII of this work,
and will be established by strict symbolic reasoning in Volume
II.&hellip;The other object of this work, which occupies Part I, is
the explanation of the fundamental concepts which mathematics accepts
as indefinable. This is a purely philosophical task&hellip;. (1903:
xv)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Though Frege&rsquo;s system was subject to Russell&rsquo;s Paradox,
subsequent examination of his system shows how much of the development
of arithmetic is possible independently of the paradoxical elements of
the system. In particular, recent interest in Frege&rsquo;s system has
led to the isolation of what is called &ldquo;Frege&rsquo;s
theorem&rdquo;  in a consistent fragment of Frege&rsquo;s original system,
and thus to the goal of deriving arithmetic, as formalized in
Peano&rsquo;s postulates. See the entry
 <a href="../frege-theorem/">Frege&rsquo;s theorem and foundations for arithmetic</a>,
 which presents this aspect of Frege&rsquo;s system in contemporary
notation.</p>

<p>
Russell had written <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> (PoM),
which presents the basic elements of his logicist program, before
discovering Frege&rsquo;s similar work in <em>Foundations of
Arithmetic</em> and <em>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</em>, in June of
1902. As he describes in the Preface, Russell intended a formal
presentation of his account in a &ldquo;Volume II&rdquo; of PoM. In
1903 he enlisted Alfred North Whitehead to join him in the writing of
this second volume, but soon this turned into a new project,
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, a massive three-volume work, which was
not to be published until 1910 (Volume I), 1912 (Volume II) and 1913
(Volume III).</p>

<p>
The system of PM differed significantly from Frege&rsquo;s system, in
a large part because of the introduction of the <em>theory of
types</em>, whose purpose was to avoid, in a principled
fashion, the paradox that had affected Frege. A second important
difference from Frege&rsquo;s system is that PM is based on a logic of
relations of various numbers of arguments, whereas Frege&rsquo;s
system was based on the notions of function and object, with even his
distinctively logical <em>concepts</em> being seen as functions (from
a number of objects to the truth values T and F, which are also
objects in Frege&rsquo;s system). So it might be said that PM is
based on a theory of ramified types of relations, in contrast to
Frege&rsquo;s second-order predicate calculus with concepts. The most
important step is to define set expressions in terms of higher-order
functions. Thus the paradoxical &ldquo;Russell set&rdquo;, the set of
all sets which are not members of themselves, \(\{ x \mid x \notin
x\}\), is defined by an expression involving functions that will
violate the theory of types. The expression for the offending class is
ruled out on the basis of the theory of types, as is its seeming
innocuous complement, the set of all sets that <em>are</em> members of
themselves, \(\{ x \mid x \in x\}\). In contemporary set theory \(\{ x
\mid x \notin x\}\) is the universe of sets, which is not itself a
set, and because no set is an element of itself, \(\{ x \mid x \in
x\}\) is just the empty set. An additional cost of this method is that
while for Frege sets are objects of the lowest types, there will be
sets in the PM theory in a <em>simple theory</em> of types, which
distinguishes individuals and sets of individuals and sets of sets of
individuals, etc. Even to derive a hierarchy of sets in the simple
theory the <em>axiom of reducibility</em> is needed to guarantee that
more complex &ldquo;impredicative&rdquo; definitions pick out sets of
the same simple type. Thus the &ldquo;least upper bound&rdquo; of a
closed interval of real numbers will identify a member of that set of
a higher order in the ramified theory. That this least upper bound
will be of the same simple type requires the axiom of reducibility.
The cost of adopting the theory of types to avoid the paradox extends
to difficulties in constructing the natural numbers. While Russell
follows Frege in many important details, in particular in using
Frege&rsquo;s notion of the ancestral of the successor relation to
define the natural numbers, other parts of the construction are
importantly different. Frege was able to define the successor of a
number by using the set of its predecessors. The number 2 is the set
containing 0 and 1, and thus it has two members. They will, however,
be of different types in the hierarchy of simple types, and so the
whole set of natural numbers cannot be defined within the theory of
simple types. Since each step from 0 to 1, to 2, etc., raises the
simple types from 0 to 1 to 2, there will be no simple type of all the
natural numbers, so defined. Instead PM adopts the <em>axiom of
infinity</em> which assures the existence of an infinite number of
individuals, allowing for the construction of the natural numbers for
each type above a lower bound of 3 (as numbers will be sets of
equinumerous sets of individuals&hellip;).</p>

<p>
With this turn to the ramified theory of types, along with the extra
axioms of reducibility and infinity, it is possible for PM to
define a version of Frege&rsquo;s construction of the natural numbers
so that the &ldquo;Peano axioms&rdquo; can be proved from logic alone.
This takes us up to section &lowast;120, well into Volume II. At this
point the alternative to &ldquo;Frege&rsquo;s theorem&rdquo; is
completed, in the sense that we are presented with a consistent
development of the natural numbers, based on a theory of higher-order
logic with a number of additional axioms. Philosophers soon followed
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1922) and disputed the idea that these additional
axioms, the axioms of reducibility and infinity, are really logical
truths, and so denied that the logicist program of reducing arithmetic
to logic was any more successful than Frege&rsquo;s attempt had
been.</p>

<p>
The survey of PM will proceed through the remainder of Volume II and
through Volume III, where the theories of rational and real numbers
are developed. The contrast intended here is not with Frege&rsquo;s
theories of rational and real numbers, which are present in
<em>Grundgesetze</em> but are not seen as a natural extension of the
theory of natural numbers. Instead the contemporary account of natural
numbers and real numbers is seen as an elementary extension of the
axiomatic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. A standard textbook in
elementary axiomatic set theory, such as Enderton 1977 or Suppes 1960,
shows how to construct rational numbers (and negative integers) as
ordered pairs of natural numbers. Thus 3/4 is constructed as the
ordered pair \(\langle 3, 4 \rangle,\) and the operations of addition
and multiplication on rational numbers are defined as operations on
those pairs. The positive rational numbers are extended to the full
set of rational numbers by adding pairs containing negative integers,
and then real numbers are defined as Dedekind cuts in the rational
numbers, i.e., the set of partitions of sets of rational numbers. The
arithmetic of real numbers is then defined for these constructions,
and so with sets of real numbers the whole of analysis can be reduced
to arithmetic. PM, however, avoids this &ldquo;arithmetization&rdquo;
of analysis, but instead defines rational numbers, real numbers, and
in fact a huge class of &ldquo;relation numbers&rdquo; as sets of
isomorphic sets of relations. Russell says later that he regrets that
the theory of relation numbers was not picked up by later set
theorists even though this was some of his most original work in
PM. The brief summary of these later topics that we include below can
therefore be seen as a summary of the interesting consequences of
taking a different route to the definition of natural numbers based on
a logic of relations and properties, rather than the set theory of
contemporary foundations of mathematics. This entry is thus aimed at
an explication of the unusual order of presentation of these results,
in comparison with both Frege and contemporary set theory, and at
illustrating these aspects of the theory of relations that are not
investigated by contemporary researchers.</p>

<h2 id="HistSignPrinMath">2. History of and Significance of <em>Principia Mathematica</em></h2>

<h3 id="HistPrinMath">2.1 History of <em>Principia Mathematica</em></h3>

<p>
Logicism is the view that (some or all of) mathematics can be reduced
to (formal) logic. It is often explained as a two-part thesis. First,
it consists of the claim that all mathematical truths can be
translated into logical truths or, in other words, that the vocabulary
of mathematics constitutes a proper subset of the vocabulary of logic.
Second, it consists of the claim that all mathematical proofs can be
recast as logical proofs or, in other words, that the theorems of
mathematics constitute a proper subset of the theorems of logic. As
Russell writes, it is the logicist&rsquo;s goal &ldquo;to show that
all pure mathematics follows from purely logical premises and uses
only concepts definable in logical terms&rdquo; (1959: 74).</p>

<p>
The logicist thesis appears to have been first advocated in the late
seventeenth century by Gottfried Leibniz. Later, the idea was defended
in much greater detail by Gottlob Frege. During the critical movement
of the 1820s, mathematicians such as Bernard Bolzano, Niels Abel,
Louis Cauchy, and Karl Weierstrass succeeded in eliminating much of
the vagueness and many of the contradictions present in the
mathematics of their day. By the mid- to late 1800s, William Hamilton
had gone on to introduce ordered couples of reals as the first step in
supplying a logical basis for the complex numbers, and Karl
Weierstrass, Richard Dedekind, and Georg Cantor had all developed
methods for founding the irrationals in terms of the rationals. Using
work done by H.G. Grassmann and Richard Dedekind, Giuseppe Peano had
then gone on to develop a theory of the rationals based on his now
famous axioms for the natural numbers. By Frege&rsquo;s day, it was
thus generally recognized that large parts of mathematics could be
derived from a relatively small set of primitive notions.</p>

<p>
Even so, it was not until 1879, when Frege developed the necessary
logical apparatus, that logicism could finally be said to have become
technically plausible. After another five years&rsquo; work, Frege
arrived at the definitions necessary for logicising arithmetic, and
during the 1890s he worked on many of the essential derivations.
However, with the discovery of paradoxes such as
 <a href="../russell-paradox/">Russell&rsquo;s paradox</a>
 at the turn of the century, it appeared that additional resources
would need to be developed if logicism were to succeed.</p>

<p>
By 1902, both Whitehead and Russell had reached this same conclusion.
Both men were in the initial stages of preparing second volumes to
their earlier books on related topics: Whitehead&rsquo;s 1898 <em>A
Treatise on Universal Algebra</em> and Russell&rsquo;s 1903 <em>The
Principles of Mathematics.</em> Since their research overlapped
considerably, they began collaborating on what would eventually become
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>. By agreement, Russell worked primarily
on the philosophical parts of the project, including the book&rsquo;s
philosophically rich Introduction, the theory of
 <a href="../descriptions/">descriptions</a>,
 and the no-class theory (in which set or class terms become
meaningful only when placed in well-defined contexts), all of which
can still be read fruitfully even by non-specialists. The two men then
collaborated on the technical derivations. As Russell writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As for the mathematical problems, Whitehead invented most of the
notation, except in so far as it was taken over from Peano; I did most
of the work concerned with series and Whitehead did most of the rest.
But this only applies to first drafts. Every part was done three times
over. When one of us had produced a first draft, he would send it to
the other, who would usually modify it considerably. After which, the
one who had made the first draft would put it into final form. There
is hardly a line in all the three volumes which is not a joint
product. (1959: 74)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Initially, it was thought that the project might take a year to
complete. Unfortunately, after almost a decade of difficult work on
the part of the two men, Cambridge University Press concluded that
publishing <em>Principia Mathematica</em> would result in an estimated loss of 600
pounds. 
 Although the press agreed to assume half this amount and the
Royal Society agreed to donate another 200 pounds, this still left a
100-pound deficit. Only by each contributing 50 pounds were the
authors able to see their work through to publication (Whitehead,
Russell, &amp; James 1910).</p>

<p>
Publication involved the enormous job of typesetting all three volumes
by hand. From January to May of 1911 the printing of the second volume
was interrupted when Whitehead discovered a difficulty with the
symbolism. The result was the insertion (on roman numeral pages) of a
long &ldquo;Prefatory Statement of Symbolic Conventions&rdquo; at the
beginning of Volume II.</p>

<p>
The initial print run of 750 copies of Volume I and 500 copies of each
of Volumes II and II from Cambridge University Press had been sold by
1922 when Rudolf Carnap wrote to Russell asking for a copy. Russell
responded by sending Carnap a 35-page handwritten summary of the
definitions and some important theorems in the work (Linsky 2011:
14&ndash;15). As no plates were available for a second printing,
Russell began the work of preparing a second edition,
which appeared in 1925&ndash;7. The first edition was reset along
with a new introduction and three appendices, and Volume II was reset
as well. Volume III was reproduced by a photographic process, and so
the page numbers from the first edition are the same in this volume.
<em>Principia Mathematica</em> is still in print.</p>

<p>
As with many works in mathematics, the later progress of the field of
symbolic logic led to numerous improvements. Work in the school of
logic started by David Hilbert at G&ouml;ttingen and in the Polish
school of logicians led by S. Le&#347;niewski and his most famous
student, Alfred Tarski, began with correcting what they saw as defects
and gaps in PM (see Kahle 2013 and Wole&#324;ski 2013). The
criticisms were immediate, begun by Chwistek (1912) soon after the
first volume had been published. A series of important new
presentations of mathematical logic, in particular Hilbert and
Ackermann 1928, Hilbert and Bernays 1934, and Kleene 1952, were
adopted as textbooks by successive generations of logicians. As
pointed out in Urquhart 2013, this led to a slow decline in the number
of references to PM in technical work in logic, as well as its gradual
replacement by other texts for the Introduction to Symbolic Logic
courses that soon became a staple offering of university departments
of philosophy. By the 1950s PM was no longer used as a textbook, even
in graduate courses. PM&rsquo;s influence, then, was enormous from
1910 to 1950, with it now having the status of a recognized classic
that is unfamiliar to students of logic, and even unreadable because
of its superseded notation. This entry, together with the entry on
 <a href="../pm-notation/">the notation in <em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>,
 is intended to make the contributions of this monumental work
available, and to enable further research on some of the ideas hidden
in those three long volumes.</p>

<h3 id="SignPrinMath">2.2 Significance of <em>Principia Mathematica</em></h3>

<p>
Achieving <em>Principia&rsquo;s</em> main goal proved to be a
challenge. An initial response among mathematicians and logicians in
Germany and Poland was to decry the decline in standards of formal
rigor set by Frege. This complaint was voiced by Frege himself, in a
letter to Philip Jourdain in 1912:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;I do not understand the English language well enough to be
able to say definitely that Russell&rsquo;s theory (<em>Principia
Mathematica I</em>, 54ff) agrees with my theory of functions of the
first, second, etc. levels. It does seem so. But I do not understand
all of it. It is not quite clear to me what Russell intends with his
designation \(\phi \bang \hat{x}\). I never know for sure whether he
is speaking of a sign or of its content. (Frege 1980: 78)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This claim that the notion of &ldquo;propositional function&rdquo; is
subject to use-mention confusions has persisted to this day. This
entry will present a modernized version of the syntax of PM, combined
with an account of the notation for types in the works of Alonzo
Church (1974, 1976). Modern theories of types allow for a coherent
syntax for higher-order languages which many find adequate to meet
these objections. The complaint about the formulation of the syntax of
PM was repeated and a further difficulty was expressed by G&ouml;del
(1944 [1951]) in his influential survey of PM:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is to be regretted that this first comprehensive and thorough-going
presentation of a mathematical logic and the derivation of mathematics
from it [is] so greatly lacking in formal precision in the foundations
(contained in &lowast;1&ndash;&lowast;21 of Principia) that it
presents in this respect a considerable step backwards as compared
with Frege. What is missing, above all, is a precise statement of the
syntax of the formalism. Syntactical considerations are omitted even
in cases where they are necessary for the cogency of the proofs, in
particular in connection with the &ldquo;incomplete symbols&rdquo;.
These are introduced not by explicit definition, but by rules
describing how sentences containing them are to be translated into
sentences not containing them. To be sure, however, that (or for what
expressions) this translation is possible and uniquely determined and
that (or to what extent) the rules of inference apply to the new kind
of expressions, it is necessary to have a survey of all possible
expressions, and this can be furnished only by syntactical
considerations. (G&ouml;del 1944 [1951: 126])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The issue with respect to defined expressions, including the
&ldquo;incomplete symbols&rdquo; for classes and definite descriptions
which are explained below, is still problematic for interpreting PM.
The difficulty is that certain defined expressions, such as the
notation for definite descriptions, class abstracts and even the
identity symbol &lsquo;\(=\)&rsquo;, are not specified in the initial
description of the syntax of the theory, nor are they shown to be
validly used as instances of the axioms with their apparent syntax.
The method of &ldquo;contextual definition&rdquo; used in PM is
difficult to formulate rigorously and is not used in contemporary
logical theories. The modern presentation of PM in this entry includes
the symbols for descriptions and classes, thus differing from the
completely rigorous presentations of Church (1976), for example, who
avoids both definite descriptions and class expressions, and takes
identity as an undefined primitive.</p>

<p>
Despite these concerns about the rigor of the presentation, PM
nevertheless was studied carefully by those interested in the new
symbolic logic, including David Hilbert and those in his school in
G&ouml;ttingen (see Ewald &amp; Sieg 2013: 3; Chwistek 1912).
Primarily at issue were the kinds of assumptions Whitehead and Russell
needed to complete their project. Although <em>Principia</em>
succeeded in providing detailed derivations of many major theorems in
finite and transfinite arithmetic, set theory, and elementary measure
theory, three axioms in particular were arguably non-logical in
character: the axiom of infinity, the axiom of reducibility, and
the &ldquo;multiplicative axiom&rdquo; or axiom of choice. The axiom of
infinity in effect states that there exists an infinite number of
objects. Arguably it makes the kind of assumption generally thought to
be empirical rather than logical in nature. The multiplicative axiom,
later added to Zermelo&rsquo;s axioms as the axiom of choice, asserts
the existence of a certain set containing one element from each member
of a given set. Russell worried
that without a rule guiding the choice, the existence of such a set was not guaranteed by logic alone. (See the discussion in section 4.1.2 below.) The axiom of reducibility was introduced as a means
of overcoming the not completely satisfactory effects of the
 <a href="../type-theory/">theory of types</a>,
 the mechanism Russell and Whitehead used to restrict the notion of a
well-formed expression, thereby avoiding Russell&rsquo;s paradox.
Although technically feasible, many critics concluded that the axiom
was simply too <em>ad hoc</em> to be justified philosophically.
Initially at least, Leon Chwistek (1912) believed that it led to a
contradiction. Akihiro Kanamori sums up the sentiment of many
readers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In traumatic reaction to his paradox Russell had built a complex
system of orders and types only to collapse it with his Axiom of
Reducibility, a fearful symmetry imposed by an artful dodger.
(Kanamori 2009: 411)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the minds of many, the issue of whether mathematics could be
reduced to logic, or whether it could be reduced only to set theory,
thus remained open.</p>

<p>
In response, Whitehead and Russell argued that both axioms were
defensible on inductive grounds. As they tell us in the Introduction
to the first volume of <em>Principia</em>,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
self-evidence is never more than a part of the reason for accepting an
axiom, and is never indispensable. The reason for accepting an axiom,
as for accepting any other proposition, is always largely inductive,
namely that many propositions which are nearly indubitable can be
deduced from it, and that no equally plausible way is known by which
these propositions could be true if the axiom were false, and nothing
which is probably false can be deduced from it. If the axiom is
apparently self-evident, that only means, practically, that it is
nearly indubitable; for things have been thought to be self-evident
and have yet turned out to be false. And if the axiom itself is nearly
indubitable, that merely adds to the inductive evidence derived from
the fact that its consequences are nearly indubitable: it does not
provide new evidence of a radically different kind. Infallibility is
never attainable, and therefore some element of doubt should always
attach to every axiom and to all its consequences. In formal logic,
the element of doubt is less than in most sciences, but it is not
absent, as appears from the fact that the paradoxes followed from
premisses which were not previously known to require limitations.
(1910: 62 [1925: 59])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whitehead and Russell were also disappointed by the book&rsquo;s
largely indifferent reception on the part of many working
mathematicians. As Russell writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Both Whitehead and I were disappointed that <em>Principia
Mathematica</em> was only viewed from a philosophical standpoint.
People were interested in what was said about the contradictions and
in the question whether ordinary mathematics had been validly deduced
from purely logical premisses, but they were not interested in the
mathematical techniques developed in the course of the
work.&hellip;Even those who were working on exactly the same subjects
did not think it worth while to find out what <em>Principia
Mathematica</em> had to say on them. I will give two illustrations:
<em>Mathematische Annalen</em> published about ten years after the
publication of <em>Principia</em> a long article giving some of the
results which (unknown to the author) we had worked out in Part IV of
our book. This article fell into certain inaccuracies which we had
avoided, but contained nothing valid which we had not already
published. The author was obviously totally unaware that he had been
anticipated. The second example occurred when I was a colleague of
Reichenbach at the University of California. He told me that he had
invented an extension of mathematical induction which he called
&lsquo;transfinite induction&rsquo;. I told him that this subject was
fully treated in the third volume of the <em>Principia</em>. When I
saw him a week later, he told me that he had verified this. (1959:
86)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite such concerns, PM proved to be remarkably influential in at
least three ways. First, it popularized modern mathematical logic to
an extent undreamt of by its authors. By using a notation more
accessible than that used by Frege, Whitehead and Russell managed
to convey the remarkable expressive power of modern predicate logic in
a way that previous writers had been unable to achieve. Second, by
exhibiting so clearly the deductive power of the new logic, Whitehead
and Russell were able to show how powerful the idea of a modern formal
system could be, thus opening up new work in what soon was to be
called metalogic. Third, <em>Principia Mathematica</em> reaffirmed
clear connections between logic  and two of the main branches
of traditional philosophy, namely metaphysics and epistemology,
thereby initiating new and interesting work in both of these
areas.</p>

<p>
As a result, not only did <em>Principia</em> introduce a wide range of
philosophically rich notions (including
 <a href="../propositional-function/">propositional function</a>,
 <a href="../logical-construction/">logical construction</a>,
 and
 <a href="../type-theory/">type theory</a>),
 it also set the stage for the discovery of crucial metatheoretic
results (including those of Kurt G&ouml;del, Alonzo Church, Alan
Turing and others). Just as importantly, it initiated a tradition of
common technical work in fields as diverse as philosophy, mathematics,
linguistics, economics and computer science.</p>

<p>
Today a lack of agreement remains over the ultimate philosophical
contribution of <em>Principia</em>. Some authors hold that, with
the appropriate modifications, logicism remains a feasible project.
Others hold that the philosophical and technical underpinnings of the
project remain too weak or too confused to be of great use to the
logicist. (For more detailed discussion, readers should consult Quine
1963, 1966a, 1966b; Landini 1998, 2011; Linsky 1999, 2011; Hale and
Wright 2001; Burgess 2005; Hintikka 2009; and Gandon 2012.)</p>

<p>
There is also lack of agreement over the importance of the second
edition of Volume I of the book, which appeared in 1925 (Volumes II
and III were directly reprinted from the first edition in 1927). The
revisions were done by Russell, although Whitehead was given the
opportunity to advise. In addition to the correction of minor errors
throughout the original text, changes to the new edition included a
new Introduction and three new appendices. (The appendices discuss the
theory of quantification, mathematical induction and the axiom of
reducibility, and the principle of extensionality respectively.) The
book itself was reset more compactly, making page references to the
first edition obsolete. Russell continued to make corrections as late
as 1949 for the 1950 printing, the year he and Whitehead&rsquo;s widow
finally began to receive royalties.</p>

<p>
Today there is still debate over the ultimate value, or even the
correct interpretation, of some of the revisions, revisions that were
motivated in large part by the work of some of Russell&rsquo;s
brightest students, including Ludwig Wittgenstein and Frank Ramsey.
Appendix B has been notoriously problematic. The appendix purports to
show how mathematical induction can be justified without use of the
axiom of reducibility; but as Alasdair Urquhart reports,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The first indication that something was seriously wrong appeared in
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s well known essay of 1944, &ldquo;Russell&rsquo;s
Mathematical Logic&rdquo;. There, G&ouml;del points out that line (3)
of the demonstration of Russell&rsquo;s proposition
&lowast;89&middot;16 is an elementary logical blunder, while the
crucial &lowast;89&middot;12 also appears to be highly questionable.
It still remained to be seen whether anything of Russell&rsquo;s proof
could be salvaged, in spite of the errors, but John Myhill provided
strong evidence of a negative verdict by providing a model-theoretic
proof in 1974 that no such proof as Russell&rsquo;s can be given in
the ramified theory of types without the axiom of reducibility.
(Urquhart 2012)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Linsky (2011) provides a discussion, both of the Appendix itself and
of the suggestion that by 1925 Russell may have been out of touch with
recent developments in the quickly changing field of mathematical
logic. He also addresses the suggestion, made by some commentators,
that Whitehead may have been opposed to the revisions, or at least
indifferent to them, concluding that both charges are likely without
foundation. (Whitehead&rsquo;s own comments, published in 1926 in
<em>Mind</em>, shed little light on the issue.)</p>

Together, the three volumes are divided into six parts. The commentary
that follows will go through the sections in order, indicating in the
early parts where a reader can skip ahead to study the unique features
of the development of mathematics in the PM system as contrasted with
that of Frege and contemporary set theory.</p>

<h3 id="VoluI">3.1 Volume I</h3>

<p>
Volume I comprises a lengthy Introduction in three sections, followed
by two major Parts I (divided into Sections A&ndash;E) and II (also
divided into Sections A&ndash;E). The system of &lowast; numbers was
designed so that theorems and definitions might be added or removed
without requiring any change to other numbers. Apparently the original
plan was to set aside numbers &lowast;1 to &lowast;10 for
propositional logic and &lowast;10 to &lowast;15 for the theory of
quantification. In the end, only &lowast;1 to &lowast;5 were needed
for propositional logic, and &lowast;9 was added later to provide a
new account of quantification later in the writing. (See Linsky 2016
and 2022.)

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
A fourth volume on geometry was begun but never completed (Russell
1959: 99).</p>

<p>
Overall, the three volumes not only represent a major leap forward
with regard to modern logic, they are also rich in early
twentieth-century mathematical developments. To give one example,
Whitehead and Russell were the first to define a series as a set of
terms having the properties of being asymmetrical, transitive and
connected (1912 [1927: 497]). To give another, it is in
<em>Principia</em> that we find the first detailed development of a
generalized version of Cantor&rsquo;s transfinite ordinals, which the
authors call &ldquo;relation numbers&rdquo;. The resulting
&ldquo;relation-arithmetic&rdquo; in turn led to significant
improvements in our understanding of the general notion of structure
(1912: Part IV).</p>

<p>
As T.S. Eliot points out, the book also did a great deal to promote
clarity in the use of ordinary language in the early part of the
twentieth century:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
how much the work of logicians has done to make of English a language
in which it is possible to think clearly and exactly on any subject.
The <em>Principia Mathematica</em> are perhaps a greater contribution
to our language than they are to mathematics. (1927: 291)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The book is also not without some self-deprecating humour. As
Blackwell points out (2011: 158, 160), the authors twice poke fun at
the length and tedium of the project&rsquo;s many logical derivations.
In Volume I, the authors explain that one cannot list all the
non-intensional functions of \(\phi \bang \hat{z}\) &ldquo;because
life is too short&rdquo; (1910 [1925: 73]); and in Volume 3, after
over 1,800 pages of dense symbolism, the authors end Part IV, Section
D, on Cyclic Families, with the comment,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We have given proofs rather shortly in this Section, particularly in
the case of purely arithmetical lemmas, of which the proofs are
perfectly straightforward, but tedious if written out at length. (1913
[1927: 461])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Evidence that the humour originates more with Russell than with
Whitehead is perhaps found in not dissimilar remarks that appear in
Russell&rsquo;s other writings. Russell&rsquo;s comment when
discussing the axiom of choice, to the effect that given a collection
of sets, it is possible to &ldquo;pick out a representative
arbitrarily from each of them, as is done in a General Election&rdquo;
(1959: 92), is perhaps a case in point.</p>

<p>
Readers today (i.e., those who have learned logic in the last few
decades of the twentieth century or later) will find the book&rsquo;s
notation somewhat antiquated. Readers wanting assistance are advised
to consult the entry on the
 <a href="../pm-notation/">notation in <em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>.
 Even so, the book remains one of the great scientific documents of
the twentieth century.</p>

<h2 id="VoluI_1">4. Volume I</h2>

<h3 id="PartIMathLogi">4.1 Part I: Mathematical Logic</h3>

<h4 id="PropLogiPM">4.1.1 Propositional Logic in PM</h4>

<p>
The system of <em>propositional logic</em> of PM can be seen as a
system of <em>sentential logic</em> consisting of a language and
rules of inference. PM contains the first presentation of symbolic
logic that deals with propositional logic as a separate theory. Frege
had involved quantification from the beginning, while Peano&rsquo;s
system was interpretable as about propositions and classes with some
different principles holding for each interpretation. The
propositional logic of PM is unusual for modern readers, for various
reasons having to do with its origins in Russell&rsquo;s earlier work
on logic. One is that the axioms of propositional logic are not stated
using only the primitive connectives of the logic, which are \(\lnot\)
and \(\lor\), but instead only use \(\lor\), and \(\supset\) which is
a defined connective.</p>

<p>
In this section we will use <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, etc. as
meta-linguistic variables for formulas. The formulas constructed from
atomic propositions with the connectives are said to express
<em>elementary propositions</em> to distinguish them from propositions
involving quantifiers and propositional functions. The system is
organized axiomatically; the axioms, called &ldquo;primitive
propositions&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pp&rdquo;, are presented with the
characteristic &lsquo;\(\supset\)&rsquo; of material implication,
which is defined with \(\lnot\) and \(\lor\). The connectives \(\amp\)
and \(\equiv\) are also defined, but not needed in the statements of
the axioms. This peculiarity has its origins in Russell&rsquo;s view
from 1903 that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The propositional calculus is characterized by the fact that all its
propositions have as hypothesis and as consequent the assertion of a
material implication. (1903: 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All of the &ldquo;primitive propositions&rdquo; of <em>The Principles
of Mathematics</em> are stated with only material implication as
a primitive connective. The connectives \(\amp\),\(\lor\) and
\(\equiv\) are defined as might be expected. The notion of
negation, expressed by \(\lnot\), is defined using a notion of
quantification over propositions ( \(\lnot A\) means that <em>A</em>
implies all propositions). By 1906 Russell had decided to use
\(\lnot\) as a primitive connective, and no longer used propositional
quantifiers, allowing \(\supset\) to be defined, while the primitive
propositions were still stated with \(\supset\) and \(\lor\). That the
system of propositional logic in PM was the result of an evolution of
changes in choices of primitives is mirrored in the choice of theorems
that are proved in the first chapters. While most are proved because
they will be used later in PM, some remain simply as remants of the
earlier systems. In particular PM contains several theorems that were
primitive propositions in earlier systems, though not used in what
follows. In fact one primitive proposition of PoM, known as
&ldquo;Peirce&rsquo;s law&rdquo; (\([(p \supset q )\supset p ]
\supset p\)) appears to have been proved in an early version of PM as
&lowast;2&middot;7 but simply deleted (and its number not reassigned
to another theorem) simply to save space (see Linsky 2016).</p>

<p>
The notion of truth-functional <em>semantics</em> for propositional
logic, using the familiar truth tables, and the notion of
<em>completeness</em> of an axiom system, were not developed
until soon after the publication of PM by Bernays (1926). As a result
there is no attempt to find a short list of axioms that will be
complete, and so at later stages of the work there is no simple appeal
to &ldquo;tautological consequences&rdquo; which might be easily
justified by semantic considerations.</p>

<p>
The language of propositional logic in PM consists of a vocabulary
comprising:</p>

<ul>

<li>Atomic proposition variables: <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>,
\(p_1\), &hellip; (There are no proposition constants.)</li>

<li>Sentential connectives. Primitive: \(\lnot\) and \(\lor\).
Defined: \(\supset\), \(\amp\), \(\equiv\).</li>

<li>Punctuation: \((\), \()\), \([\), \(]\), \(\{\), \(\}\), etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The well formed formulas (<em>wffs</em>) are defined as follows:</p>

In 1926 Paul Bernays showed that this could be reduced by one, as
axiom 4 (&lowast;1&middot;5) can be proved from the others.</p>

<ul>

<li><em>Modus ponens</em> (&lowast;1&middot;1): From \(\vdash A
\supset B\) and \(\vdash A\), derive \(\vdash B\)</li>

<li><em>Substitution</em>: From \(\vdash A\) derive \(\vdash A'\)
where \(A'\) is the result of substituting some formula <em>B</em>
uniformly for any atomic proposition variable that occurs in
<em>A</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
There is no explicit statement of a rule of substitution in PM. The
free variables in the propositional logic of PM may be interpreted as
schematic letters, and so the system will require a rule of
substitution of formulas. In this article they are to be interpreted
as real variables ranging over propositions, in which case instances
would be derived by instantiation from generalizations over all
propositions. The announcement in the Introduction that propositions
are not necessary in what follows and so will be avoided suggests the
schematic interpretation of the variables. We follow the variable
interpretation in this article, however, in part to allow our notation
to follow PM, with <em>p</em>s and <em>q</em>s rather than a new
vocabulary of schematic letters <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, etc. This
interpretation of the letters as variables will also assist in the
presentation of quantificational logic in PM below.</p>

<p>
As is standard for an axiomatic formulation of logic, a
<em>derivation</em> of a formula of sentential logic in PM will
consist of an instance of one of the six axioms, the result of a
substitution in a preceding line, or the application of modus ponens
to two preceding lines. Theorems of PM will be proved in order,
allowing the use of (instances of) preceding theorems as lines in
later derivations.</p>

<p>
The resulting system is complete, in the sense that all and only
truth-functionally valid sentences are derivable in the system. This
is so despite the seeming defects of the system by modern standards,
including the redundancy of one of the axioms, the use of defined
symbols in expressions to which the rules of inference apply, and the
use of defined symbols in the axioms. The derivations in &lowast;2 to
&lowast;5 are abbreviated, but with an indication on the side of each
line of what justifies it, and how any abbreviation can be undone.
Theorems are proved primarily as needed in later numbers, but some
were axioms, or important theorems of earlier versions of
propositional logic, going back to <em>The Principles of
Mathematics</em>. Aside from historical interest in their actual
choices, however, the system of PM can be viewed as based on any
standard system of propositional logic.</p>

<h4 id="RamiTheoType">4.1.2 The &ldquo;Ramified&rdquo; Theory of Types and Propositional Functions</h4>

<p>
The theory of types in the initial chapters of PM is
<em>ramified</em>, so that within a given type, of propositions, or of
functions of individuals, and functions of functions of individuals,
there will be finer subdivisions. This ramification is necessary for
the application of the logic of PM to what what are called
&ldquo;epistemological&rdquo; paradoxes in the Introduction to PM. The
most prominent of these is the (propositional) Liar paradox created by
the proposition that all propositions of a certain sort, say asserted
by Epimenides, are false, when that very proposition is of that sort,
that is the only proposition that Epimenides
asserted. The solution in the ramified theory of types requires that a
proposition about a sort of first-level proposition, say that they are
all false, will itself be of the next order.</p>

<p>
The paradoxes of the theory of sets are resolved by reducing
assertions about sets to assertions about propositional functions. The
restriction that a function of one type cannot apply to a function of
the same type is enough to block these paradoxes. Thus the distinction
between individuals, functions of individuals, and functions of such
functions, categorized by what came to be called the &ldquo;simple
theory of types&rdquo;, is enough for the purposes of reducing
mathematics to classes, and so to logic. The idea that the full theory
of types was not needed to resolve the mathematical or set-theoretical
paradoxes was proposed by Chwistek in Polish in 1921 (English
translation: Chwistek 1921 [1967]; English papers are Chwistek
1925 and Ramsey 1925). Use of the term &ldquo;ramified theory of
types&rdquo; for the original system of PM followed soon after, and is
followed in this entry.</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that while Ramsey is generally credited with
introducing the distinction between ramified and simple type theories,
both the idea and the term &ldquo;simple theory of
types&rdquo; were anticipated by Leon Chwistek. Chwistek used the
expression in his Polish paper of 1921, which was only
available in English translation as 1967. He says, in that translation: &ldquo;To eliminate this
antinomy [a reconstruction of Richard&rsquo;s paradox using the axiom
of reducibility] it is sufficient to accept the simple theory of
types, which distinguishes individuals, functions of individuals,
functions of these functions, and so on&rdquo; (Chwistek 1921
[1967: 342&ndash;343]). The earliest statement of the view in
English is: &ldquo;&hellip; with propositional functions whose
arguments take functions of the 1st type as possible values, i.e.
propositional functions of the 2nd type, and so on. Such a simple
hierarchy of types would be, as a matter of fact, sufficient to build
up a self-consistent system of Symbolic Logic&rdquo; (Chwistek
1925: 12). Chwistek&rsquo;s paper was included in the list of
&ldquo;the more important contributions to mathematical logic since
the publication of the first edition&rdquo; in the Introduction to the
second edition of PM. Ramsey had checked the list, and even suggested
additions, when he read a draft of the new material for the second
edition. It is apparent that Ramsey had not read Chwistek 1925,
however, as it was not &ldquo;available&rdquo; in Cambridge, according
to Ramsey (see Linsky 2011: 34).</p>

<p>
Ramsey introduces the distinction by pointing out that the paradoxes
fall into two sorts:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; the paradoxes listed in <em>Principia Mathematica</em> fall
into two fundamentally distinct groups which we will call A and B
&hellip;
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&hellip; Group A consists of contradictions which, were no provision
made against them, would occur in a logical or mathematical system
itself. They involve only logical or mathematical terms such as class
and number, and show that there must be something wrong with our logic
or mathematics. But the contradictions of Group B are not purely
logical, and cannot be stated in logical terms alone; for they all
contain reference to thought, language, or symbolism, which are not
formal but empirical terms.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This view of the second group of contradictions is not original. For
instance Peano decided that &ldquo;Exemplo de Richard non pertine ad
Mathematica, sed ad linguistica&rdquo; and therefore dismissed it. But
such an attitude is not completely satisfactory. We have
contradictions involving both mathematical and linguistic ideas; the
mathematician dismisses them by saying that the fault must lie in the
linguistic elements, but the linguistician may equally well dismiss
them for the opposite reason, and the contradictions will never be
solved. The only solution that has ever been given, that in
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, definitely attributed the
contradictions to bad logic, and it is up to the opponents of this
view to show clearly the fault in what Peano called linguistics, but
what I should prefer to call epistemology, to which these
contradictions are due. (Ramsey 1925 [1931: 20&ndash;21])
</blockquote>

<p>
Group A paradoxes can be resolved in the simple theory of types, but
those involving thought, language and symbolism, or meaning, are set
aside as perhaps empirical and not logical problems.</p>

<p>
Alonzo Church accepted the distinction in his (1932) review of
Ramsey&rsquo;s article, and himself used the simple theory of types in
his early papers. Readers will note, however, that Church continued
with his study of the notions Ramsey calls &ldquo;linguistic&rdquo;
(semantic), such as the notions of meaning and belief, now called
&ldquo;intensional&rdquo;. This interest resulted, years later, in
Church 1976, a precise formal presentation of the ramified theory of
types and a comparison with Tarski&rsquo;s treatment of the semantic
paradoxes.</p>

<p>
Although PM does not single out first-order logic from the whole
ramified theory of types, the actual deductive apparatus on the page
looks exactly like a system of first-order logic, and the
complications of the logic of higher types can be expressed with an
additional apparatus of type indices. In what follows we will use the
system of <em>r-types</em> in Church 1976 for type indices, and
the use of &lambda;-<em>operators</em> for propositional functions.</p>

<p>
In the Introduction to PM, terminology is introduced for the two ways
that variables may appear in formulas. The &ldquo;apparent
variables&rdquo; are <em>bound variables</em>, whereas &ldquo;real
variables&rdquo; are <em>free variables</em>. The proper
interpretation of higher-order variables in PM is the subject of
contemporary dispute among scholars of PM. Landini (1998) and Linsky
(1999) offer two rival accounts. Landini holds that higher-order free
variables should be interpreted as schematic letters, replaceable by
formulas, and that the bound variables are to be interpreted
&ldquo;substitutionally&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The disagreement is not over whether a substitutional interpretation
is possible, but whether it was the <em>intended interpretation</em>
of Whitehead and Russell. It is clear that PM contains passages siding
in both ways, and any claim about &ldquo;the&rdquo; interpretation of
PM must be seen as to some extent a proposal about how to reconstruct
a coherent position that fits with the majority of the passages. See
Fitch 1938 and 1974 for a substitutional accounts of systems
related to the ramified theory of types of PM. Klement
2010 argues that Russell held such a substitutional account of
propositional functions as his intended interpretation continuously
after their introduction in Russell 1903, through both editions
of PM.</p>

<p>
In this entry we follow Church&rsquo;s realist interpretation of the
notion of &ldquo;propositional function&rdquo; that Ramsey proposed.
Russell&rsquo;s remarks seem to be inconsistent with this reading in
some places, and we see them as indicating some vacillation over the
interpretation that is behind the technical presentation after the
informal Introduction (and prefatory remarks to some later sections
such as the chapter on the axiom of reducibility).</p>

<p>
Ramsey saw himself as arguing for a broader conception of
propositional functions than seems to be presented in PM, where there
seems to be a restriction to those that can be defined or expressed in
a language. They are called &ldquo;functions in extension&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
The possibility of indefinable classes and relations in extension is
an essential part of the extensional attitude of modern mathematics
which we emphasized in Chapter I, and that it is neglected in
<em>Principia Mathematica</em> is the first of three great defects in
that work. (Ramsey 1925 [1931: 23])
</blockquote>

<p>
Ramsey proposes a notion of propositional functions in extension, so
that:</p>

<blockquote>
Thus \(\phi\) (Socrates) may be Queen Anne is dead, \(\phi\)(Plato)
may be Einstein is a great man; \(\phi\) being simply an arbitrary
association of propositions \(\phi\) to individuals \(x\). (Ramsey
1925 [1931: 52]).
</blockquote>

<p>
A function such as Ramsey&rsquo;s \(\phi\) can be indefinable in
general (what is the value of \(\phi\) for Aristotle, or any other
individual?). It seems as though we must rely on our intuitions about
the infinity of indefinable functions, working backwards from our
intuitions about the sets that are their extensions, as set theory
relies on the existence of sets far beyond those that are definable in
some arbitrary language. This is certainly suggested by Ramsey in his
example of the function \( \phi \) above.</p>

<p>
In his <em>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</em>, Russell
expresses his qualms about the multiplicative axiom with his
well-known example of the millionaire who has an \( \aleph_0 \)
infinity of boots and of socks:</p>

<blockquote>
The product of these classes will pair boots and socks. He says among
boots, we can distinguish between right and left and therefore we can
make a selection of one out of each pair, namely, we choose all the
right boots or all the left boots; but with socks no such principle of
selection suggests itself, and we cannot be sure, unless we assume the
multiplicative axiom, that there is any class consisting of one sock
out of each pair. Hence the problem. (Russell 1919: 126)
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who accepted Ramsey&rsquo;s broader notion of &ldquo;function in
extension&rdquo;, would find the axiom of choice to be true, even
though in many cases, the &ldquo;choice function&rdquo; that it
guarantees to exist will be indefinable, as for the case of the
millionaire&rsquo;s socks. It was thought that surely a choice set
existed, and the axiom of choice was added to Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF)
set theory to produce the now standard ZFC. This was long before it
was shown to be independent of the rest of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
by Cohen in 1963 (see Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel and Levy
1973: 58&ndash;81).</p>

<p>
Church seems to see Ramsey&rsquo;s &ldquo;propositional functions in
extension&rdquo; as in fact the position that was accepted in PM,
despite Russell&rsquo;s own later qualms:</p>

<blockquote>
Of course, there may be such things as indefinable classes, and if
\(\alpha \) is an indefinable class there is no definable
propositional function which determines \(\alpha\). But this, as we
understand it, is not denied by the authors of <em>Principia
Mathematica.</em> (Church 2019: 49)
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, in this entry we follow Church&rsquo;s realistic interpretation
of propositional functions, allowing for a propositional function to
have an arbitrary set as its extension, as well as to see hierarchy of
functions as represented by the ramified theory of types.</p>

<p>
The logic of the theory of types in PM can be seen as an extension of
a theory of a standard first-order logic developed in &lowast;10. Then
the more distinctive notions of PM that depend on the theory of types
can be explained. These include the axiom of reducibility in
&lowast;12, which underlies the so called <em>ramification</em> of the
theory of types, the division into <em>orders</em> of predicates true
of a single type of argument. The axiom of reducibility asserts that
for an arbitrary function of any order there is an equivalent
<em>predicative</em> function, that is, one true of exactly the same
range of arguments. This will be explained below. Identity is defined,
in &lowast;13, with a version of Leibniz&rsquo;s notion of the
identity of indiscernibles that is consistent with the theory of
types. Replacing Leibniz&rsquo;s notion that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
are identical just in case they share the same properties, in
PM <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are identical if and only if they
share the same predicative functions. Then using the notion of
identity so defined, PM presents Russell&rsquo;s theory of definite
descriptions, precisely as it was defined in &ldquo;On Denoting&rdquo;
(1905). This article will use the notation for
&ldquo;<em>r</em>-types&rdquo; due to Church (1976), which is
explained below, and in the accompanying article &ldquo;The Notation
of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>&rdquo; in this Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
Ramsey&rsquo;s introduction of the simple theory of types was
immediately influential, beginning with his correspondence in 1928
with Adolf (Abraham) Fraenkel who was then preparing the third edition
of his <em>Einleitung in die Mengenlehre</em> (Introduction to Set
Theory). Fraenkel included a discussion of the semantic and
set-theoretic paradoxes, giving the now standard name
&ldquo;verzweigten Typentheorie&rdquo; to the ramified theory of types
(Fraenkel 1928: 258). Fraenkel appears to have thought that if
all possible sets are included as the extensions of first-order
functions, the axiom of reducibility will surely be true, and need not
be explicitly added as an axiomatic assumption. Rudolf Carnap&rsquo;s
1929 textbook limits itself to the simple theory of types, citing
Ramsey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Foundations of Mathematics&rdquo; (Carnap
1929: 21). Ramsey thus directly influenced the widespread
attention to the simple theory of types in Germany and the Vienna
Circle.</p>

<div class="indent">
<!-- start of Church's formulation -->

<hr />

<p>
<strong>Church&rsquo;s (1976) formulation of the logic of PM with
<em>r-types</em></strong>. The language of the higher-order
quantificational logic of PM is called <em>ramified type theory</em>,
and the system of types, following Church, will be called
<em>r</em>-types. Note that there are two kinds of variables, but they
are all assigned to an r-type. Individual variables behave as a
special case of propositional function variables.</p>

<ul>

<li>(argument) variables: \(x_{\mathbf{\tau}}\),
\(y_{\mathbf{\tau}}\), \(z_{\mathbf{\tau}}\), &hellip;for each type
\(\tau\)</li>

<li><em>n</em>-place propositional function variables:
\(\phi_{\tau}^{n}, \psi_{\tau}^{n}\), &hellip;(\(n \geq 1\)), where
\(\tau\) is a type symbol. (\(R^n,S^n, \ldots\) (\(n \geq 1\)) for
<em>relations in extension</em>.) \(\chi\) is used for a higher-order
function of functions, as in \(\chi (\phi)\), and \(\Phi\) for the
next order, as in \(\Phi (\chi)\)</li>

<li>connectives: \(\lnot\), \(\lor\)</li>

<li>punctuation: \((\), \()\), \([\), \(]\), \(\{\), \(\}\), etc.</li>

<li>the quantifier symbols: \(\forall\) and \(\exists\)</li>

<li>the lambda symbol: \(\lambda\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The system of symbols for <em>r</em>-types and the assignment of
<em>r</em>-types to variables for different entities (individuals and
functions) is as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\iota\) is the <em>r</em>-type for an <em>individual</em>.</li>

<li>Where \(\tau_1 , \ldots, \tau_m\) are any <em>r</em>-types, then
\((\tau_1 , \ldots, \tau_m) / n\) is the <em>r</em>-type of a
propositional function of <em>level n</em>; this is the
<em>r</em>-type of any <em>m</em>-ary propositional function of
<em>level</em> <em>n</em>, which has arguments of <em>r</em>-types
\(\tau_1 , \ldots, \tau_m\), respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <em>order</em> of an entity is defined as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>the <em>order</em> of an individual (of <em>r</em>-type \(\iota\))
is 0</li>

<li>the <em>order</em> of a function of <em>r</em>-type \( (\tau_1,
\ldots, \tau_m ) / n \) is \(n+N\) where <em>N</em> is the greatest of
the orders of the arguments \(\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_m\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are no predicate or individual names in this language. There
are, however complex terms for propositional functions, defined
together with formulas (with the usual notion of bound and free
variables):</p>

<p>
Let the expressions \(\phi_{\tau}\) be variables ranging over
propositional functions of type \(\tau\). We read \(x_{\tau}\) as a
metalinguistic variable ranging over variables of <em>r</em>-type
\(\tau\). The subscript \(\tau\) will be indicated only with the
initial quantifier which governs the variable.</p>

<p>
We then can define the <em>well formed formulas</em> (wffs) and
<em>terms</em> of quantificational logic as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Variables (for individuals and propositional functions) are
terms.</li>

<li>

<p>
If \(\phi_{\tau}^{n}\) is an <em>n</em>-place propositional function
variable of <em>r</em>-type \((\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_n) /k\) and \(x_{i}
\) for \( ( 0 \leq i \leq n ) \) are terms of of <em>r</em>-types
\(\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_n\), respectively, then \(\phi (x_1, \ldots
x_n)\) is a <em>wff</em>.</p>

<p>
(The variables \(x_n\) are called &ldquo;argument&rdquo; variables.
They will include <em>individual variables</em> of <em>r</em>-type
\(\iota\), but also variables of higher types. The variable \(\phi\)
can occur as a predicate in \(\phi(x)\) and as an argument in \(\Psi
(\phi)\), and cannot be of type \(\iota\) to occur in a
<em>wff</em>.)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If <em>x</em> is a variable of type \( \tau \) and <em>A</em> is a
<em>wff</em> then \(\lambda x A\) is a <em>term</em> of
<em>r</em>-type \((\tau)/n\) (where <em>n</em> is one more than the
highest order of any bound variable in <em>A</em> and at least as high
as the order of any free variable in <em>A</em>).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If <em>x</em> is an individual variable of type \(\tau\) and
<em>A</em> is a wff in which <em>x</em> occurs \(free\) then \(\forall
x A\) and \(\exists x A\) are wffs.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are wffs, then so are \(\lnot A\), \(A
\amp B\), \(A \lor B\), \(A \supset B\), and \(A \equiv B\).</p>

<p>
The conventional precedence ordering of connectives will allow for
fewer punctuation signs to indicate scope of connectives, thus \(A
\lor B \supset C\) is read as \(( A \lor B) \supset C\)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The comprehension principle for a system of higher-order logic, or set
theory, states which formulas express a property or set. Within a type
theory this allows for what looks like an &ldquo;unrestricted&rdquo;
comprehension principle, in that for every well formed expression
<em>A</em> with a free variable, <em>x</em>, there is a property which
is satisfied by precisely the entities satisfying the formula. It is
the restrictions of types that block the paradoxes, as the problematic
formulas &ldquo;is not a member of itself&rdquo; and &ldquo;does not
apply to itself&rdquo; are ruled out by the system of types. The
comprehension principle then is characterized by an infinite set of
sentences of the form of:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Comprehension:</p> 
\[\exists \phi \forall x_{\tau} [ \phi (x) \equiv A], \quad (\phi \textrm{ not free in } A)\]

<p>
where \(\phi\) is a functional variable of <em>r</em>-type
\((\tau)/n\) and <em>x</em> is a variable of <em>r</em>-type \(\tau\),
and the bound variables of <em>A</em> are all of order less than the
order of \(\phi\) and the free variables of <em>A</em> are all of
order not greater than the order of \(\phi\).</p>
</div>

<hr />
<!-- end of Church's formulation-->
</div>

<p>
As presented here Church&rsquo;s seemingly straightforward
comprehension principle, with its restrictions on the types of
variables, is for Quine a glaring manifestation of the confusion of
use and mention of language that he sees infecting PM:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;there is a characteristic give and take between sign and
object: the propositional function gets its order from the abstractive
expression, and the order of the variable is the order of the values.
Exposition is eased by allowing the word &lsquo;order&rsquo; a double
sense, attributing orders at once to the notations and, in parallel,
to their objects. (Quine 1963: 245)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The offense comes from attributing orders (<em>r</em>-types) to
propositional functions on the basis of the variables with which they
are defined, but also to the functions themselves, as simply values of
bound higher-order variables. In response, the defender of type theory
must say that any semantic intrepretation of the notion of
propositional function will have to attribute to functions these
distinctions that are marked in linguistic expressions of some of
them, and in particular, the variables involved in their
definition.</p>

<p>
What follows in PM up to &lowast;12 is a presentation of
quantificational logic in the ramified theory of types. The
complications are due to the decision of the authors (surely on
Russell&rsquo;s insistence) to add a new section &lowast;9 which
allows the earlier theory of propositional logic to be incorporated
directly into a quantificational logic as is done in contemporary
logic. This shows the extent to which the earlier theory is indeed a
theory of <em>propositions</em>, not an account of a fragment of
quantificational logic allowing open sentences containing free
variables.</p>

<h5 id="QuanLogiPM">Quantificational Logic in PM</h5>

<p>
Section &lowast;10 formulates quantificational logic as it is
currently formulated, i.e. the axioms and theorems of propositional
logic are assumed to hold for all formulas, and not just the
elementary propositions of &lowast;1&ndash;5. It appears that Russell
became concerned about this assumption, and so a new section &lowast;9
was introduced to derive the principles of quantification theory from
elementary propositions alone. While of interest to scholars of PM,
the upshot is the same for later uses of quantificational logic in
PM.</p>

<p>
Again, the reader interested in what distinguishes the logicist
project in PM can skip this section, although passing attention may be
paid to the system of higher-order logic that is used, as based here
on the <em>ramified theory of types</em>.</p>

<p>
The extension to functions of more than one variable is obvious, and
below, some applications will employ this extension.</p>

<p>
The existential quantifier and the other familiar connectives
\(\supset\), \(\amp\) and \(\equiv\) are defined as for propositional
logic (in what follows <em>A</em> is now an arbitrary (possibly
quantificational) formula):</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗10·01} \exists x A \eqdf \lnot \forall x \lnot A \]

<ul class="hanging">

<li>Axioms of &lowast;10: All instances of propositional theorems
where wffs are uniformly substituted for propositional
variables. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The system of PM uses a rule of universal generalization and an axiom
which amounts to a rule of instantiation.</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗10·1} \vdash \forall x_{\tau} A \supset A' \]

<p>
where \(A'\) is like <em>A</em> except for having a term <em>y</em> of
type \(\tau\) substituted for \(x_{\tau}\) in <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>
(Note: The notion of suitable &ldquo;substitution&rdquo; is much more
complicated for logic of higher types than it is for first-order
logic. In part this is because of the application to an argument of
lambda expressions for a propositional function, e.g., \([\lambda x
\phi (x)] (\nu)\) where \(\nu\) may be a complex term involving
variables and quantifiers in other lambda expressions.)</p>

\[ \tag*{∗10·11} \textrm{If } \vdash A \textrm{ then } \vdash \forall x_{\tau} A' \]

<p>
where \(A'\) is like <em>A</em> except for having a term <em>y</em> of
type \(\tau\) substituted for <em>x</em> in <em>A.</em></p>

<p>
Other quantifier principles, which govern the move of a quantifier
from the inside of a formula to governing the entire formula,
so-called &ldquo;quantifier containment principles&rdquo;, are also
derived as theorems in &lowast;10. Some that are often used in later
numbers are:</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
\tag*{∗10·12} \forall x_{\tau} ( A \lor \phi (x ) ) &amp; \supset (A \lor \forall x_{\tau} \phi (x ))\\
 \tag*{∗10·21} \forall x_{\tau} [ A \supset \phi (x ) ] &amp; \equiv [A \supset \forall x_{\tau} \phi (x)]\\

<p>
The introduction to &lowast;10 in PM begins with:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The chief purpose of the propositions of this number [&lowast;10] is
to extend to formal implications (<em>i.e.</em> to propositions of the
form \(\forall x (\phi x \supset \psi x)\) as many as possible of the
propositions proved previously for material implications,
<em>i.e.</em> for propositions of the form \(p \supset q\). [notation
updated]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, this section introduces the logic of quantification,
in a way that is familiar to contemporary logic. The propositional
logic of the preceding sections is interpreted as true only of
elementary, first-order propositions, and so extended to higher-order
logic by showing how sentences can be presented in &ldquo;prenex
form&rdquo;, that is with quantifers in intial position preceding a
quantifier-free matrix. These theorems are familiar now as
&ldquo;quantifier confinement&rdquo; theorems, of the form of:</p>

\[ \tag*{∗10·23} \forall x_{\tau} [ \phi (x ) \supset A ] \equiv [ \exists x_{\tau} \phi (x)] \supset A \]

<h5 id="AxioRedu">The Axiom of Reducibility</h5>

<p>
Given that the system of PM contains a ramified theory of types,
however, the move to discussion of classes for the remainder of the
work after &lowast;20 requires a further axiom, the axiom of
reducibility, in order to allow a simple theory of types of classes.
Consider the fundamental notion from the theory of real numbers of the
<em>least upper bound</em> (<em>l.u.b.</em>) of a bounded class of
real numbers. Consider the class of all real numbers whose square is
less than or equal to 2, i.e., \(\{ x \mid x^2 \leq 2\}\). A class of
reals <em>S</em> has an <em>upper bound</em> if and only if \(\exists
r \forall s ( s \in S \supset s \leq r)\). If a bounded class
<em>S</em> of real numbers has members of some <em>r</em>-type
\(\tau\), then the least upper bound must belong to an <em>r</em>-type
\(\tau / 1\) because of the quantifier in the definition ranging over
the elements <em>s</em> of <em>S</em>. We say that the definition of
<em>S</em> is &ldquo;impredicative&rdquo; because it involves
quantification over a totality to which it is intended to belong. The
theory of real numbers, however, requires that sometimes the least
upper bound of a class is a member of that class: in this case,
the least upper bound of <em>S</em>, namely \(\sqrt{2}\), is an
element of <em>S</em>.</p>

<p>
The resolution of this in the system of PM is to adopt an axiom which
guarantees that any class defined in terms of another class will be of
the same type. Thus impredicative definitions of classes are allowed,
and do not introduce a class of a higher type. This is accomplished by
adopting the axiom of reducibility, in &lowast;12, which guarantees
that for any function \(\phi\), there will be a co-extensive
<em>predicative</em> function. More precisely, the axiom of
reducibility asserts that for any function of any number of arguments
of an arbitrary level, there is an equivalent function of level 1, ie.
one true of the same entities:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Axiom of reducibility:</p> \[ \tag*{Pp ∗12·1} \forall \psi \exists
\phi \forall x_{\tau} [\psi (x) \equiv \phi \bang(x) ] \]

<p>
where \(\phi \bang\) is a <em>predicative function</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>
The exclamation mark &ldquo;\(\bang\)&rdquo; is used in PM to indicate
<em>predicative functions</em>. In Church&rsquo;s system of
<em>r</em>-types this is expressed by saying that the variable
<em>x</em> is of <em>r</em>-type \(\tau\) and \(\phi\) is of
<em>r</em>-type \((\tau )/1\) and \(\psi\) is of <em>r</em>-type
\((\tau) /n\). In other words, \(\phi\) is of the lowest order
compatible with its arguments. This notion of predicative functions is
taken from the Introduction. In &lowast;12 Whitehead and Russell
propose a narrower conception of predicative function, by which
\(\phi\) must be a <em>matrix</em>, or function in the definition of
which no quantifiers at all appear. See the accompanying entry on
 <a href="../pm-notation/">the notation in <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.</a>
 </p>

<p>
It has seemed to some, beginning with Chwistek 1912 and 1922, and
continuing through Copi 1950, that the axiom of reducibility is
technically faulty, leading to an inconsistency, or at least
redundancy, in the system of PM. Ramsey early on (1925) argued that
the supposed contradiction in fact demonstrated that certain
predicative functions are indefinable. Church (1976) confirms this
assessment, and uses the presentation of <em>r</em>-types we describe
here to show rigorously the limitations on what functions are
definable in the system of PM.</p>

<p>
The interaction of this axiom with the theory of classes in PM will be
explained below in connection with &lowast;20 on classes.</p>

<h5 id="IdenPM">Identity in PM</h5>

<p>
Contemporary logic follows Frege in treating <em>identity</em>,
represented by \(=\), as a logical notion. In PM the notion of
identity is defined following Leibniz as indiscernibility, i.e.
indiscernible objects are identical. That is, \(\forall \phi ( \phi x
\equiv \phi y) \supset x = y\). But since the axiom of reducibility
guarantees that if there is any type of function on which <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> differ, they will differ on some predicative function,
PM uses the following definition of identity:</p> \[ \tag*{∗13·01}
x_{\tau} = y_{\tau} \eqdf \forall \phi [ \phi \bang (x) \supset \phi
\bang(y) ], \]

<p>
for \(\phi \bang\) a predicative function.</p>

<p>
In contemporary systems of logic an axiom or rule of inference allows
that if \(x = y\), then for any predicate \(\phi\), \(\phi x \equiv
\phi y\). In other words, identicals are indiscernible. The given
definition of identity only suffices if it is not possible that
entities <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> which share all predicative
properties, cannot be distinguished by some property of a higher
order. The axiom of reducibility guarantees that <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> sharing properties of any given higher order will entail
sharing predicative properties, and so by the definition of identity,
\(x = y\).</p>

<p>
In the appendix B to the second edition of PM, which was written by
Russell, there is a technical discussion of the consequences of
abandoning the axiom of reducibility. A faulty proof is proposed to
show that the principle of induction can be derived without using the
axiom of reducibilty in a modified theory of types (see Linsky 2011).
As Russell points out, however, it is not possible to define real
numbers using &ldquo;Dedekindian&rdquo; classes of rational numbers
without assuming the axiom of reducibility. (The thesis that every
class of reals with an upper bound has a real number as its least
upper bound, discussed above, would not be provable.) As a result,
Russell says &ldquo;analysis would collapse&rdquo;. In all of this
discussion, however, Russell does not indicate what would replace the
definition of dentity in &lowast;13, which so crucially depends on the
axiom of reducibility.</p>

<h5 id="DefiDesc">Definite Descriptions</h5>

<p>
Russell presented his theory of definite descriptions in &ldquo;On
Denoting&rdquo; (1905) and it has probably been the most widely
discussed application of the logic of PM. The role of the theory of
definite desciptions in PM, however, is exhausted by its use in
&lowast;30 to define what are called &ldquo;descriptive
functions&rdquo;. In contemporary logic it is routine to show how the
notion of a &ldquo;functional relation&rdquo; can be used to justify
the introduction of function symbols into a language with only
<em>n</em>-place predicates. The theory of definite descriptions is
essential for this argument. After &lowast;30 there are only a handful
of occurrences of description operators in PM. What is perhaps
Russell&rsquo;s most valuable contribution to philosophical logic and
the philosophy of language is, here, only a device used for a
technical, though programatically important, purpose. The technical
purpose, however, does indicate an important distinction between the
logicisms of Frege and Russell. Frege&rsquo;s logic is based on the
notion of concept, which is a case of a function from objects to truth
values. Russell&rsquo;s logic can be seen as further reducing the
mathematical notion of function to his logical notion of
<em>propositional function</em>. Some logicians firmly in the
tradition of mathematical logic do not find this to be an advance, but
it does indicate a significant difference between the approaches of
Frege and Russell (see Linsky 2009).</p>

<p>
Definite descriptions are expressions of the form &ldquo;the
\(\phi\)&rdquo; which occur in the position of terms apparently as the
arguments of functions. Russell&rsquo;s example from &ldquo;On
Denoting&rdquo; (1905) is the expression &ldquo;The present King of
France&rdquo; which apparently occurs as an argument to the function
&ldquo;is bald&rdquo; in the sentence &ldquo;The present King of
France is bald&rdquo;. In general the expression &ldquo;the \(\phi\)
is \(\psi\)&rdquo; is defined as equivalent to the expression
&ldquo;There is exactly one \(\phi\) and it is \(\psi\)&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Contextual definition of Definite Descriptions</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗14·01} \psi ( \imath x \phi (x) ) \eqdf \exists x \forall y \{ [ \phi ( y) \equiv y = x ] \amp \psi (x)\} \]

</div>

<p>
The use of the expression \(\eqdf\), which makes it appear that both
flanking expressions are terms, disguises the fact that in this case
of a &ldquo;contextual definition&rdquo; what occurs on each side are
formulas, the right hand side replacing the left hand side, thus
&ldquo;eliminating&rdquo; the definite description.</p>

<p>
To distinguish the two readings of the expression &ldquo;The present
King of France is not bald&rdquo;, according to the
&ldquo;scope&rdquo; of the description (with respect to negation), PM
uses a &ldquo;scope indicator&rdquo; \( [ \imath x \phi ( x )]\)
before the formula from which the description is to be eliminated by
the definition above. Symbolize &ldquo;The present King of
France&rdquo; as \(\imath x K(x)\) and &ldquo;<em>x</em> is
bald&rdquo; as \( B(x)\), and the two readings will be symbolized
as:</p> 
\[
[\imath x K(x)] \lnot B(\imath x K(x)),
\]

<p>
which, eliminating the description by definition, becomes:</p>

\[ \exists x \forall y \{ [K(x) \equiv y = x ] \amp \lnot B(x) \} \]

<p>
which is the reading on which there is exactly one present King of
France and he is not bald, and:</p> 
\[\lnot [\imath x K(x)]B(\imath x K(x)),\]

<p>
which, eliminating the description by definition, becomes:</p>

\[ \lnot ( \exists x \forall y \{ [K(x) \equiv y = x ] \amp B(x) \} )\]

<p>
The latter is the reading on which it is not the case that there is
one and only one present King of France and he is bald. That may be
true if there is not exactly one present King of France, as is
actually the case, as France has no King. In such a case the
description is not &ldquo;proper&rdquo;, which is expressed with a
special symbol in PM, \(E\bang\), defined as:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>proper description</em></p> 
\[ \tag*{∗14·02} E\bang (\imath x \phi (x)) \eqdf \exists x \forall y [ \phi (y) \equiv y = x ] \]

</div>

<p>
In theorem &lowast;14&middot;3 we find one of the rare occurrences of
bound variables ranging over propositions <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> of
functions that are not predicative. (Suppose that <em>p</em> and
<em>q</em> are of some <em>r</em>-type \(()/n\) and <em>f</em> is a
function of those propositions, <em>f</em> might have <em>r</em>-type
\((()/n)/m\) for \(m, n &gt; 1\).) Here we also see an occurrence
of a formula \(\imath x \phi (x)\) in subject position expressing a
proposition as an argument of such a function. These expressions do
not figure in theorems later in PM and only occasionally in the
introductory material of some sections. Theorem &lowast;14&middot;3
asserts that in truth-functional contexts the scope of a (proper)
description does not affect the truth value of a proposition in which
it occurs:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗14·3} \begin{align}
\{ \forall p \forall q [ ( p \equiv q ) \supset (\Phi(p) \equiv \Phi(q) )] \amp E\bang ( \imath x \phi(x) ) \} \supset \\
 \{ \Phi [\imath x \phi (x) ]\chi(\imath x \phi (x) )\equiv [\imath x \phi (x)] \Phi(\chi(\imath x \phi (x ))) \} 
\end{align} \]

<p>
This theorem is another indication of the way in which the
philosophical basis of PM, with its propositional functions that are
intensional, is left behind as the mathematical content of PM is
introduced with the definition of classes in the next sections.</p>

<h5 id="NoClasTheoClas">The &ldquo;No-Classes&rdquo; Theory of Classes</h5>

<p>
The theory of sets (<em>classes</em>) in PM is based on a number of
contextual definitions, similar in some ways to the theory of
descriptions. In what follows we will occasionally use the expression
&ldquo;class&rdquo; for the PM notion, to remind the reader of the
differences between this and an axiomatic theory of sets, such as
ZF: not to indicate that these are &ldquo;proper classes&rdquo;
in the sense used in ZF or VGB class theory, but to indicate an
expression that does not define a set, such as \(\{ x \mid x = x \}\),
which is true of the <em>universe</em> \(\rV\) and so too
&ldquo;large&rdquo; to be a set.</p>

<p>
The basic definition eliminates terms for classes from contexts in
which they occur, just as the theory of definite descriptions
eliminates descriptions occuring in the positions of terms:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Contextual definition of classes</p> 
\[ \phi \{x \mid \psi (x) \} \eqdf \exists \chi \left [ \begin{split}
\forall x [ \chi \bang (x) \equiv \psi (x) ] \\
 {} \amp \phi (\lambda x \chi (x)) 
\end{split} \right] \tag*{∗20·01} \]

<p>
for \(\chi \bang\) a predicative function.</p>
</div>

<p>
In other words, an expression seeming to attribute the property
\(\phi\) to a class \(\{x \mid \psi (x) \}\) is true if and only if
there is some predicative property \(\chi\), which is co-extensive
with \(\psi\), which really has the property \(\phi\).</p>

<p>
The notion of membership (\(\in\)) which is the one non-logical
relation symbol of ZF, is defined in the PM system:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Definition of \(\in\)</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗20·02} x \in \phi \eqdf \phi \bang (x) \]

<p>
for \(\phi\) a predicative function.</p>
</div>

<p>
The principal role of this &ldquo;no-classes&rdquo; theory of classes,
as it is called, is to show how the theory of types resolves the
paradoxes that had afflicted the naive theory of classes in <em>The
Principles of Mathematics</em> and was seen by Russell to afflict
Frege&rsquo;s theory. After these foundational sections, all the
individual variables that appear in PM should be seen as ranging over
classes (and, as will be explained below, the relation symbols
are to be interpreted as ranging over relations in extension). The
paradoxes appear in different forms, as seen in the Introduction to
PM, but the resolution of the paradox of &ldquo;the class of all
classes which do not belong to themselves&rdquo;, which appears in
Russell&rsquo;s initial letter to Frege, will be used as our example.
This class, which leads directly to a contradiction, would appear in
contemporary notation as \(\{ x \mid x \notin x \}\). The paradox
arises when one asks whether that class is a member of itself or not.
The expression that it is a member of itself \(\{ x \mid x \notin x \}
\in \{ x \mid x \notin x \}\) will have two class expressions to be
eliminated by the first definition, and then several uses of the
relation symbol \(\in\) which will also be eliminated. In the end
there will be an expression \(\lnot (\phi_{\tau} \in \psi_{\tau})\),
which is not legitimate, since this is not well-formed for any
\({\tau}\). A function must be of a higher order than its
arguments.</p>

<p>
The effect of these two definitions is to demonstrate that classes
fall into a simple theory of types, and while subject to these type
restrictions, all of the inferences involving class expressions
observe classical quantification theory as stated in &lowast;10 above.
The definitions of existential and universal quantification are
simple. Note that Russell uses Greek letters (\(\alpha\),
\(\beta\),&hellip;) to range over classes:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Definition of quantification over &ldquo;all classes&rdquo;</p>

\[ \tag*{∗20·07} \forall \alpha \chi (\alpha) \eqdf \forall \phi \chi ( \{ x \mid \phi \bang(x) \})\]

<p>
for \(\phi \bang\) a predicative function.</p>

<p>
Definition of quantification over &ldquo;some classes&rdquo;</p>

\[ \tag*{∗20·071} \exists \alpha \chi ( \alpha ) \eqdf \exists \phi \chi \{ x \mid \phi \bang(x) \}\]

<p>
for \(\phi \bang\) a predicative function.</p>
</div>

<p>
The definition of \(\in\) is extended to classes without change:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Definition of membership of a class in a function</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗20·07} \alpha \in \psi \eqdf \psi \bang ( \alpha) \]

<p>
for \(\psi \bang\) a predicative function.</p>
</div>

<p>
The remainder of &lowast;20 consists of theorems proving that the
theorems of quantificational logic developed in &lowast;10 apply as
well to expressions about classes, with the &ldquo;Greek&rdquo;
variables \(\alpha, \beta, \ldots\) in the place of individual
variables \(x, y, \ldots\). Because formulas with Greek variables look
and behave the same as individual variables with respect to
quantificational logic, it is possible to overlook the interaction of
the theory of classes with the theory of types. As G&ouml;del points
out in the passage quoted above (G&ouml;del 1944 [1951: 126]), the
&ldquo;contextual definitions&rdquo; of class variables \(\alpha\),
\(\beta\), etc. do not specify the elimination of class
abstracts from all possible contexts, and in particular those that
talk about classes. Linsky (2004) argues that PM has no notation for
classes of propositional functions to distinguish them from classes of
classes, although one could be added. This is another indication of
the turn in PM after the intial sections (up to &lowast;21) to an
extensional system of classes and relations.</p>

<p>
In effect the class variables can be seen as propositional function
variables, restricted to <em>r</em>-types in which only predicative
functions appear, in arguments as well, leading to what might be seen
as &ldquo;hereditarily predicative functions&rdquo;. In other words,
the class variables can be replaced with propositional function
variables in which the <em>r</em>-type of the function and of all
the arguments is of the form \((\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_m
)/1\), and the same applies to \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_m\)
as well. This means that variables and terms for classes will obey the
simple theory of types. These can be contrasted with <em>r</em>-types
by presenting an alternative system of simple types or
&ldquo;<em>s</em>-types&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Church&rsquo;s (1974) &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; Theory of
Types</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>\(\iota\) is the <em>s</em>-type for an <em>individual</em>.</li>

<li>Where \(\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_m\) are any <em>s</em>-types, then
\((\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_m)\) is the <em>s</em>-type of a propositional
function of a <em>m</em>-ary propositional function which has
arguments of <em>s</em>-types \(\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_m\),
respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <em>order</em> of an entity in the system of <em>s</em>-types is
defined as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>the <em>order</em> of an individual (of <em>s</em>-type \(\iota\))
is 0</li>

<li>the <em>order</em> of a function of <em>s</em>-type \( ( \tau_1
\ldots, \tau_m )\) is \(n+1\) where <em>n</em> is the greatest of the
order of the arguments \(\tau_1 \ldots, \tau_m\)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;order&rdquo; is not quite the one that
is familiar from standard logic texts, in which &ldquo;first-order
logic&rdquo; uses only bound individual variables, and
&ldquo;second-order logic&rdquo; uses both bound individual variables
and bound variables ranging over properties of individuals.  In
Church's system of s-types, <em>first</em>-order logic has bound
variables of <em>s</em>-type 0, whereas <em>second</em>-order logic
also includes bound variables of <em>s</em>-type 1. Thus, the familiar
notion of &lsquo;order&rsquo; in logic texts employs one number higher
than the highest order of any of the bindable variables in
the <em>s</em>-type system.</p>

<p> 
Frank Ramsey (1925) argued that the simple theory of types was
adequate for blocking the set theoretic paradoxes, but not the
paradoxes of semantic concepts like truth or the paradoxes of belief that
Russell called <em>epistmological</em>. Church (1976) argues that
those paradoxes can be resolved in ramified type theory in a way that
is similar to Tarski's (1956) solutions.</p>


<h5 id="CompClasPMAxioSetTheo">Comparison of the Classes of PM with Axiomatic Set Theory</h5>

<p>
It is widely thought that the system of PM offers a very different
approach to the solution of the paradoxes from that of axiomatic set
theory as formulated in the Zermelo-Fraenkel system ZF. While the
theory of types is thought of as a desperate attempt to save the
logicist program by artifically introducing types in order to resolve
the paradoxes, axiomatic set theory seems to simply postulate sets as
entities and adopts axioms in a first-order language with
&ldquo;\(\in\)&rdquo; for membership as its one non-logical symbol.
This view has been forcefully expressed by Quine:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whatever the inconveniences of type theory, contradictions such as
[the Russell paradox] show clearly enough that the previous naive
logic needs reforming.&hellip;There have been other proposals to the
same end&mdash;one of them coeval with the theory of types. [Quine
cites Zermelo 1908.] But a striking circumstance is that none of these
proposals, type theory included, has any intuitive foundation. None
has the backing of common sense. Common sense is bankrupt, for it
wound up in contradiction. (Quine 1951: 153)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, both the view that type theory lacks intuitive support, and
the view that type theory and axiomatic set theory are based on the
same intuitions, date back to G&ouml;del in 1933, referring to
set theory as the &ldquo;theory of aggregates&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
At least hitherto only one solution which meets these two requirements
[of avoiding the paradoxes while retaining mathematics and the theory
of aggregates] has been found.&hellip;This solution consists in the
theory of [simple] types.&hellip;It may seem as if another solution
were afforded by the system of axioms for the theory of aggregates, as
presented by Zermelo, Fraenkel and von Neumann; but it turns out that
this system of axioms is nothing else but a natural generalization of
the theory of types, or rather, it is what it becomes of the theory of
types if certain superfluous restrictions are removed. (G&ouml;del
1933 [1995: 45&ndash;46])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The two &ldquo;restrictions&rdquo; that G&ouml;del intends are 
that types are not <em>cumulative</em> and that the levels of types
are limited to the natural numbers 0, 1,&hellip; <em>n</em>,&hellip;.
G&ouml;del suggests that one adopt a cumulative system of types in
which a given type includes functions of all lower types (or
<em>orders</em>), and the types extend beyond \(\omega\), \(\omega\) +
1, &hellip;\(\omega^{\omega}\), &hellip;, through all the ordinals.
Such a &ldquo;natural generalization&rdquo; of the theory of types, he
asserts, amounts to the same as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF).
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s claim is spelled out by George Boolos (1971) as the
&ldquo;iterative conception&rdquo; of sets, which can be expressed
formally. If one thinks of sets as built up in stages, with each stage
adding all sets of members of the last stage, and the process
extending endlessly, then the axioms of ZF set theory are indeed
provable from the axioms of the theory of the &ldquo;iterative
conception&rdquo; of sets. In turn the &ldquo;iterative
conception&rdquo; relies on a strong intuition, contrary to what Quine
says. It is the same intuition that underlies the hierarchy of
types.</p>

<p>
Following Boolos&rsquo;s presentation of the &ldquo;iterative
conception of set&rdquo; it seems that axiomatic set theory and PM do
not differ widely, and express the similar intuitive notions of set
that provide the same solution to the paradoxes.</p>

<p>
There was, in fact, a certain continuity in reasoning about
foundations of mathematics that supports G&ouml;del&rsquo;s view about
the similarity of type theory and axiomatic set theory. Both
Tarski&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Concept of Truth in
Formalized Languages&rdquo; (1956) and G&ouml;del&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Formally
Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica&rdquo; (1931 [1967])
are formulated in the simple theory of types. (While Tarski credits
Leon Chwistek for the notion of the simple theory of types which is
the logical framework of the paper, G&ouml;del cites Carnap (1929),
and Carnap in turn gives credit to Ramsey. The difference over the
origins of the simple theory of types may have been a result of
differences in familiarity with Chwistek in Warsaw and in Vienna.)
This suggests a reading of the history of the logicist reduction of
mathematics to set theory as going through Frege, then the theory of
types in PM, to the simple theory of types, and then on, in the
intuition behind axiomatic set theory, to ZFC, now favored as the
theory in which foundational issues are formulated.</p>

<p>
As presented in PM, however, the no-classes theory differs
significantly from ZF. The sentences of the PM theory are expressed in
the theory of types, as opposed to the first-order theory of ZF. ZF
and PM cannot simply be compared in terms of their theorems. Not only
are there different axioms in the two theories, but the very languages
in which they are expressed differ in logical power. If we follow
G&ouml;del and Boolos, however, the two are seen to be based on the
same intuitive basis, and the differences are seen as the same,
barring certain &ldquo;superfluous restrictions&rdquo; on the theory
of PM.</p>

<h5 id="RelaPM">Relations in PM</h5>

<p>
&lowast;21 extends the notion of class which is the extension of a
one-place propositional function to the comparable notion of a
&ldquo;relation&rdquo; for functions of two arguments with the
analogous contextual definition.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Contextual definition of a relation in extension</p> 
\[ \phi \{x ; y \mid \psi (x,y) \} \eqdf \exists \chi \left[ \begin{split}
\forall x \forall y [ \chi \bang (x,y) \equiv \psi (x,y)] \\
 {} \amp \phi ( \lambda x \lambda y \: \chi (x,y)) 
\end{split} \right ] \tag*{∗20·01} \]

</div>

<p>
(Note: The use of this unusual notation \(\phi \{x; y \mid \psi (x,y)
\}\) in this one definition is meant to avoid the implication that a
relation is interpreted as a set of ordered pairs that would be
represented by the contemporary notation \(\phi \{\langle x,y \rangle
\mid \psi (x,y) \}\). The PM notation for propositional functions, as
in \(\phi \hat{x}\), uses a caret over the variable where we would
write \(\lambda x \phi(x)\). The PM notation for a class is \(\hat{x}
\phi (x)\). A two-place propositional function is identified with
variables also with carets: \(\phi (\hat{x} \hat{y})\) and the
corresponding relation \(\hat{x} \hat{y} \phi (x,y)\). This notation
does not identify relations as classes of ordered pairs, and that is
how our blend of PM and contemporary notation in \(\phi \{x ; y \mid
\psi (x,y) \}\) is to be taken.)</p>

<p>
The introduction of Greek letters for classes in &lowast;20, and the
use of &ldquo;Roman letters&rdquo; R, S, &hellip;in &lowast;21 for
relations, mark a change in the notation used in PM. After
&lowast;21 the letters \(\phi, \psi, \ldots\) rarely appear. As Quine
remarks in his study of the logic of Whitehead and Russell, it would
seem that after a certain point the body of PM makes use of
extensional higher-order logic in a simple theory of types:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In any case there are no specific attributes [propositional functions]
that can be proved in <em>Principia</em> to be true of just the same
things and yet to differ from one another. The theory of attributes
receives no application, therefore, for which the theory of classes
would not have served. Once classes have been introduced, attributes
are scarcely mentioned again in the course of the three volumes.
(Quine 1951: 148)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Quine here hints at the view of PM that is widely shared among
mathematical logicians, who see the ramified theory of types, with its
accompanying axiom of reducibility, as a digression taking logic
into a realm of obscure intensional notions, when instead logic, even
if expressed in a theory of types, is extensional and is comparable to
axiomatic set theory presented with a simple hierarchy of sets of
individuals, sets of sets individuals, and so on.</p>

<p>
It is certainly true that the remainder of PM is devoted to the theory
of individuals, classes, and relations (in extension) between those
entities. Thus the ontology of these later portions is a hierarchy of
predicative functions arranged in a simple theory of types. This has
led one interpreter, Gregory Landini (1998), to argue that only
predicative functions are values of bound variables in PM. What we
have interpreted as variables ranging over possibly non-predicative
propositional functions, \(\phi\), \(\psi\),&hellip;, are for Landini
only schematic letters, and are not bindable variables. The only bound
variables in PM, he asserts, range over predicative functions. This is
a strong version of a view that others such as Kanamori (2009) have
expressed, going back to Ramsey (1925), namely that the introduction
of the axiom of reducibility has the effect of undoing the
ramification of the theory of types, at least for a theory of classes,
and so a higher-order logic used for the foundations of mathematics
ought to have only a simple type structure.</p>

<p>
Our interpretation of this change in attention to classes and
relations indicated by the shift in notation is that it indicates the
extent to which the solution to the paradoxes, which required a
ramified theory of (possibly intensional) propositional functions, may
have superseded a logic based on an unproblematic notion of class and
mathematical functions and relations between them, which appeared in
the body of <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> before
Russell&rsquo;s attention was drawn to the paradoxes. In the summary
of the later sections of PM that follows below, it will appear that in
fact the symbolic development follows very closely that of PoM from
ten years earlier. While we do not know much about the order in which
sections of PM were composed, it will appear from this change of
attention from propositional functions to classes and relations, that
the later parts are in fact an earlier stratum in the conceptual
development of the project that started out as a symbolic
&ldquo;Volume II&rdquo; to follow PoM.</p>

<p>
To remind the reader of the change from talking of propositional
functions to relations in extension, two further notational
alterations are introduced. Greek letters such as \(\alpha\),
\(\beta\), etc. , will be used as variables for ranging over classes
as well. The individual variables which are ambiguous with respect to
type, &ldquo;typically ambiguous&rdquo;, will now also range over
classes. A function \(\phi\) of two variables <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> is indicated with the arguments in parentheses after the
function variable: \(\phi(x, y)\). A two-place relation <em>R</em>
holding between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is written \(x \relR y\),
with the <em>R</em> in &ldquo;infix&rdquo; position. The obvious
limitation of this notation is that it is not readily extended to
three-place relations, adding a third variable, say <em>z</em>. We
will follow the practice in PM and write \(x \relR y\) for binary
relations. PM only requires binary relations for most of the three
volumes, although the projected volume IV on geometry would need a
notation for &ldquo;<em>x</em> is between <em>y</em> and
<em>z</em>&rdquo;, as can be seen from Henry Sheffer&rsquo;s
unpublished notes from Russell&rsquo;s lectures on geometry from 1910
at Cambridge. There he uses the notation \(y\rels{B}(x,y)\) which
blends the two styles.</p>

<h5 id="AlgeClas">The Algebra of Classes</h5>

<p>
The notions of the subset relation and the intersection and union of
sets are defined in PM exactly as they are now (albeit with different
terminology). The complement of a set and the universal class
\(\rV\)are not allowed in set theory, and are rejected as
&ldquo;proper classes&rdquo;. In PM, as they only are a set of
entities of a given type \(\tau\), they form a set of the next higher
type, \((\tau)/1\). The complement of a set of a given type is the set
of all entities (of that type) that are not in the set. Each empty set
will be the complement of the universal set (of a given type \(\tau\)
) and so there will be the empty set of type \(\tau\).</p>

\[ \begin{align}
\alpha \subseteq \beta &amp; \eqdf \forall x (x \in \alpha \supset x \in \beta) \tag*{∗22·01}\\
 \alpha \cap \beta &amp; \eqdf \{x \mid ( x \in \alpha \amp x \in \beta ) \tag*{∗22·02}\\
 \alpha \cup \beta &amp; \eqdf \{ x \mid (x \in \alpha \lor x \in \beta ) \tag*{∗22·03}\\
 
\end{align} \]

<p>
The type subscript \(\tau\) is added below as a reminder that the
notions of universal set \(\rV\) and complement are each with regard
to a given type (and so an empty set \(\emptyset\) will recur in each
type.)</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
- \alpha &amp;\eqdf \{ x_{\tau} \mid \lnot (x \in \alpha )\}\tag*{∗22·04}\\
 {\alpha - \beta} &amp; \eqdf {\alpha \cap {- \beta}}\tag*{∗22·05}\\
 
\end{align} \]

<h5 id="UnivClasEmptClas">The Universal Class and the Empty Class</h5> 
\[\tag*{∗24·01} \rV_{\tau + 1} \eqdf \{ x_{\tau} \mid (x = x) \} \]

<p>
The subscript on &lsquo;\(\rV\)&rsquo; indicates that the universe of
classes of a given (simple) type \(\tau\) will be a member of the next
type. There is no class of all classes of whatever type. This is in
common with axiomatic set theory which holds that there is no set of
all sets.</p> 
\[\tag*{∗24·02} \emptyset_{\tau} \eqdf - \rV_{\tau} \]

<h5 id="MathFuncPM">Mathematical Functions in PM</h5>

<p>
The logic of PM is based on <em>propositions</em>, <em>propositional
functions</em> and <em>relations in extension</em>, unlike
Frege&rsquo;s which deals with objects, in particular, truth values,
and functions, with the special case of concepts, which are functions
from objects to truth values. PM reduces mathematical functions to
&ldquo;functional relations&rdquo; in a way that is familiar from
elementary courses. If there is a binary relation which has a unique
second argument for each first argument, i.e.,</p> 
\[\forall x \exists y [x \relR y \amp \forall z (x \relR z \supset z = y)]\]

<p>
then one can introduce a new function symbol \(f_R\), such that</p>

\[\forall x \forall y (x\relR y \equiv f_R(x) = y).\]

<p>
Similarly for an \(n+1\) -place relation for each \(x_1\),
&hellip;, \(x_n\) there is a unique <em>y</em> such that \(R(x_1,
\ldots, x_n, y)\), then one can introduce an <em>n</em>-place function
<em>g</em> mapping \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\) onto <em>y</em>. In PM the
expressions for mathematical functions are definite descriptions,
referring to the last argument of a relation as the
&ldquo;value&rdquo; of the function described by that relation. We
will use the expression \(f_R\) to refer to the functional term
referring to the function derived from a relation <em>R</em>. PM uses
the explicit definite description &ldquo;the <em>R</em> of
<em>y</em>&rdquo; (written \( R`y \) ) where we would use the
functional expression \(f_R\). The definition of a <em>monadic
functional term</em> then is:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗30·01} f_Ry \eqdf (\imath x)(x \relR y) \]

<p>
with the general form for an <em>n</em>-place functional term
<em>g</em> derived from an \(n+1\) -place relation <em>S</em>
(following Russell&rsquo;s notation in lectures):</p> 
\[g_S(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \eqdf (\imath y )(x_1 S x_2, \ldots, x_n, y)\]

<p>
(The diligent reader will find that this presentation does not follow
PM exactly. The example &ldquo;the father of&rdquo; based on a
relation <em>R</em> expressing &ldquo;<em>x</em> is the father of
<em>y</em>&rdquo; would make &ldquo;the <em>R</em> of
<em>x</em>&rdquo; actually refer to the unique <em>x</em> which is the
father of <em>y</em>, and so what has been explained above is
appropriate to the <em>converse</em> of that relation, \(\relbR\). The
practice of reading the argument of a relational function as the
<em>x</em> and the value as the <em>y</em> is so well established that
we have taken a liberty with the actual definitions in PM.)</p>

<p>
Recall that from this point on in PM, the relations are to be
considered as &ldquo;relations in extension&rdquo; and so it is easy
to see how one can treat the relations as ordered \(n+1\)-tuples of
which the last member is unique given the first <em>n</em> arguments.
In particular, a monadic function <em>f</em> can be seen in the
familiar way as a set of ordered pairs (of \(\langle x, f_R(x)
\rangle\)) for each argument <em>x</em> in the domain of the
function.</p>

<p>
Given the treatment of &ldquo;relations&rdquo; as &ldquo;relations in
extension&rdquo; it is no accident that the development of the logic
of relations in &lowast;30&ndash;&lowast;38 looks familiar to
contemporary logicians, with even some of the notation from PM
surviving into contemporary usage. A series of notions are defined in
a way quite familiar to the modern treatment of relations as sets of
<em>n</em>-tuples:</p>

<h5 id="ConvRela">The Converse of a Relation</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗31·02} {\relbR} = \{\lambda x \lambda y (y \relR x)\} \]

<p>
or, in terms of pairs:</p> 
\[{\relbR} = \{ \langle x, y \rangle \mid (y \relR x) \}\]

<h5 id="DomaRangFielRela">Domains, Ranges and Fields of Relations</h5>

<p>
The notions of the <em>domain</em>, <em>range</em>, and <em>field</em>
of a relation are also given a contemporary definition (and so also
the notions of the <em>domain</em>, <em>range</em> and <em>field</em>
of a function).</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
\tag*{∗33·11} \Domain \; R &amp;\eqdf \{x \mid \exists y ( x \relR y ) \}\\
 \tag*{∗33·111} \Range \; R &amp;\eqdf \{y \mid \exists x (x \relR y) \}\\
 \tag*{∗33·112} Field \; R &amp;\eqdf \{x \mid \exists y (x \relR y \vee y \relR x ) \} \\
 
\end{align} \]

<p>
Note that it is possible that a relation can have its domain in one
type and range in another. This adds complications in the theory of
cardinal numbers when a relation of similarity (equinumerosity) holds
between classes of different types. (See the discussion of &lowast;100
below.)</p>

<h5 id="ProdTwoRela">The Product of Two Relations</h5>

<p>
The <em>composition</em> of relations <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> is
called their <em>relative product</em> and uses a different symbol
\(R\mid S\) where we write \(R \circ S\):</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗34·01} R \circ S \eqdf \lambda x \lambda z \{ \exists y ( x \relR y \amp y \relS z ) \} \]

<h5 id="RestRela">Restricted Relations</h5>

<p>
The <em>restriction</em> of (the <em>range</em> of) a
relation <em>R</em> to a particular class \(\beta\) is defined this way: 
:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗35·02} R \upharpoonright \beta \eqdf \lambda x \lambda y (x \relR y \amp y \in \beta) \]

<p>
In his survey of PM, Quine (1951: 155) complains that these last
100 pages of Part I are occupied with proving theorems relating
redundant definitions of the same notions. Thus PM defines the notion
of domain and range and then introduces notions that again define the
same classes, which are then proved to be equivalent. PM defines the
notation of &lsquo;\(R\pmdq\beta\)&rsquo; to be read as &ldquo;the
terms which have the relation <em>R</em> to members of
\(\beta\)&rdquo; and uses the example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If \(\beta\) is the class of great men, and <em>R</em> is the relation
of wife to husband, \(R\pmdq\beta\) will mean &ldquo;wives of great
men&rdquo;. (PM I [1925]: 278)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contemporary logic with the notation of set theory used above,
there is no need for a special symbol for this notion, as it is
written as:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗37·01} R\pmsq \pmsq \beta \eqdf \{ x \mid \exists y (y \in \beta) \amp x \relR y \} \]

<h5 id="ProdSumsClasClas"> [1925]Products and Sums of Classes of Classes</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗40·01} {} \cap \alpha \eqdf \{ x \mid \forall \beta (\beta \in \alpha \supset x \in \beta) \} \]

<p>
This is the <em>intersection</em> of \(\alpha\).</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗40·02} {} \cup \alpha \eqdf \{ x \mid \exists \beta (\beta \in \alpha \amp x \in \beta) \} \]

<p>
is the <em>union</em> of \(\alpha\).</p>

<h3 id="PartIIProlCardArit">4.2 Part II: Prolegomena to Cardinal Arithmetic</h3>

<h5 id="CardNumb1">The Cardinal Number 1</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗52·01} 1 \eqdf \{ \alpha \mid \exists x ( \alpha = \{x \} ) \} \]

<p>
So the cardinal number 1 is the class of all singletons. There will be
a different number 1 for each type of <em>x</em>. Frege, by contrast,
defines the natural number 1 as the extension of a certain concept,
namely being identical with the number 0, which itself is the
extension of the (empty) concept of not being self-identical. In
axiomatic set theory the natural numbers are particular finite
ordinals, in particular the series with 0 as the empty set
\(\emptyset\): 1 is \(\{ 0 \}\), 2 is \(\{0, 1 \}\), and so on. This
construction is named the <em>von Neumann ordinals</em>.</p>

<h5 id="Pair">Pairs</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗54·02} 2 \eqdf \{ \alpha \mid \exists x \exists y (x \neq y \amp \alpha = \{y \} \cup \{ x \} ) \} \]

<p>
Similarly, the number 2 is the class of all pairs, rather than a
particular pair. In the type theory of PM there will be distinct
couples for the types of <em>y</em> and <em>x</em>. When they are of
the same type the couple is called &ldquo;homogeneous&rdquo;. Even
with homogeneous pairs there will be distinct classes of pairs for
each type, and thus a different number 2 for each type. The same
notion applies to relations.</p>

<h5 id="OrdePair">Ordered Pairs</h5>

<p>
The notion of an ordered pair, called an &ldquo;<em>ordinal
couple</em>&rdquo; is defined as:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗55·01} \langle x, y \rangle \eqdf \textrm{ the extension of } \lambda x \lambda y (x \in \{x \} \amp y \in \{y\}) \]

<p>
The idea is that the order of the relation \(\lambda x \lambda y (x
\in \{x\} \amp y \in \{y\})\) determines the first and second element
of the ordered pair. It is a relation in extension, which is the
analogue of a property in extension or class. A relation in extension
has a distinction between the first and second elements due to the
order of the defining relation. The closest in contemporary language
would be:</p> 
\[\phi \langle x, y \rangle \eqdf \exists \psi \forall u \forall v ( \psi (u, v) \equiv \lambda x \lambda y [ x \in \{x\} \amp y \in \{y\} ] (u, v) \amp \phi (\psi) ) \]

<p>
Given the definition of extensions of relations this is the version of
the no-classes theory for relations. After attending classes given by
Russell the year before, and having several discussions, Norbert
Wiener (1914) proposed the following definition (in modern
notation):</p> 
\[\langle x, y \rangle \eqdf \{\{\{ x\}, \emptyset \}, \{\{ y\}\}\} \textrm{ where } \emptyset \textrm{ is the empty set.}\]

<p>
Wiener&rsquo;s accomplishment was to capture the ordering of the pair
which in PM is captured by the ordering of the arguments of relations
with the unordered notion of set membership.</p>

<h5 id="EndPM56">The End of PM to &lowast;56</h5>

<p>
The paperback abridged edition of <em>PM to &lowast;56</em> only goes
this far, so the remaining definitions have only been available to
those with access to the full three volumes of PM.</p>

<h5 id="RelaType">Relative Types</h5>

<p>
This section presents a discussion of relations between individuals of
distinct types, introducing a notation for types, \(t\pmsq x\) for the
type to which <em>x</em> belongs. This section is little used in
Volume I. The special consequences for this notion when dealing with
relative types of cardinal numbers is the topic of the Preface to
Volume II, which was added after the first volume was already in
print. The delay due to working out these details partially explains
the three-year gap between the publication of Volume I in
1910 and the remaining volumes II and III in 1913. Section
&lowast;65 (On the Typical Definition of Ambiguous Symbols), is a
discussion of <em>typical ambiguity</em>, the ambiguity of variables
with respect to type.</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗70·01} f: \alpha \rightarrow \beta \eqdf \]

<p>
The functions <em>f</em> from \(\alpha\) onto \(\beta\), that is, the
\(\Domain \; f = \alpha\) and \(\Range \; f = \beta\)</p>

<h5 id="SimiClas">Similarity of Classes</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗73·01} \alpha \approx \beta \eqdf (\exists f) f : \alpha \stackrel{1-1}{\longrightarrow} \beta. \]

<p>
There is a one-one function mapping \(\alpha\) onto \(\beta\)
(<em>similarity</em> of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)). Contemporary
discussions say that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are
<em>equinumerous</em>. Difficulties arise with respect to the
definition of cardinal numbers when the relation of similarity they
involve is one that has a domain and range in different types. See
&lowast;100 below.</p>

<p>
The main theorem in this chapter is a proof of the Cantor-Bernstein
theorem, that if a set \(\alpha\) is similar to a subset <em>z</em> of
another set \(\beta\) and \(\beta\) is similar to a subset \(\delta\)
of \(\alpha\) then \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are themselves
similar:</p> 
\[ \forall \alpha \forall \beta \forall \gamma \forall \delta \left[\left ( \begin{split}
\alpha \approx \gamma &amp; {}\amp \beta \approx \delta \\
 &amp;{} \amp \gamma \subseteq \beta \\
 &amp;{} \amp \delta \subseteq \alpha \\
 
\end{split} \right) \supset \alpha \approx \beta \right] \tag*{∗73·88} \]

<p>
The proof here explicitly follows the proof by Ernst Zermelo from
1908. Whitehead and Russell call this the
&ldquo;Schr&ouml;der-Bernstein&rdquo; theorem.</p>

<h5 id="AxioChoiMultAxio">The Axiom of Choice (Multiplicative Axiom)</h5>

<p>
The multiplicative axiom, or &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; of choice, is not an
axiom of PM, what is termed a &ldquo;primitive proposition&rdquo;, but
is instead a defined expression that is added as an hypothesis to
theorems for which it is used. This reflects the emerging awareness at
the time of the role of the axiom of choice in various proofs, in
particular, Zermelo&rsquo;s proof that every class can be
<em>well-ordered</em>.</p>

<p>
If \(\alpha\) is a class of mutually exclusive, non-empty, classes,
then there is a (&ldquo;choice&rdquo;) set \(\beta\) such that the
intersection of \(\beta\) with each member of \( \delta \) of
\(\alpha\) is a unique (chosen) member of \(\delta \).</p>

<p>
This follows Frege&rsquo;s definition, namely, that <em>y</em> is in
all the <em>R</em>-hereditary classes that contain <em>x</em> or
(<em>x</em> is in the field of <em>R</em> ).</p>

<h5 id="PoweRela">The Powers of a Relation</h5>

<p>
The &ldquo;powers&rdquo; of a relation \(R (\textrm{Pot}\pmsq R)\) are
the relations <em>R</em>, \(R^2\), \(R^3\), &hellip;where</p>

\[{R^2 \eqdf R \circ R},\quad {R^{n+1} \eqdf R \circ R^n},\quad \ldots\]

<p>
These definitions begin with &lowast;91&middot;03, using the notion of
the ancestral of a higher-order relation between relations defined
beginning with <em>R</em>.</p>

<p>
The main result of this section is another proof of the
Cantor-Bernstein theorem: &ldquo;This proof is essentially the same as
Bernstein&rsquo;s published originally by Borel [1898: Note 1, pp.
102&ndash;7]&rdquo; (PM I, 589). In this proof the one-one relation
between the sets \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is constructed from the
powers of two relations: <em>R</em> that maps \(\alpha\) into
\(\beta\), and <em>S</em> that maps \(\beta\) into \(\alpha\). The
one-one mapping is constructed in stages. First all of \(\alpha\) is
mapped onto \(\beta\) by <em>R</em>. Those elements in \(\beta\) not
in the range of <em>R</em> are mapped onto \(\alpha\) by <em>S</em>.
But some elements in the range of <em>S</em> will have already been
mapped by <em>R</em>. They need to be shifted to a new image in
\(\beta\), again by <em>R</em>. This process is iterated through all
of the powers of <em>R</em>, and then it is shown that the resulting
relation is one to one from \(\alpha\) onto \(\beta\). See Hinkis
2013 for a history of the many different proofs of this
theorem.</p>

<h2 id="VoluII_1">5. Volume II</h2>

<h3 id="PrefStatSymbConv">5.1 Prefatory Statement of Symbolic Conventions</h3>

<p>
The writing of this preface delayed the publication of the second
volume of PM, as Whitehead and Russell struggled over the
complications it raised. The difficulties arise from the <em>typical
ambiguity</em> of terms and formulas of the theory of types. Every
constant, such as those for the numbers \(0,1, \ldots, \aleph_0\) will
have a definition relative to each type. Without assuming the axiom of
infinity for individuals, there is no guarantee that a given constant
designates a non-empty class in a given type. The preface introduces
the notion of &ldquo;formal numbers&rdquo;, which are to be
interpreted as belonging to a type that makes them not identical with
the \(\emptyset\) for that type. Volume II begins with Part III,
&ldquo;Cardinal Arithmetic&rdquo;. The notions of cardinal numbers are
developed in full generality, extending to infinite cardinals.
Consequently the theory of natural numbers, which are called
&ldquo;Inductive Cardinals&rdquo; in PM, is introduced with a series
of definitions of special cases of notions that are first introduced
in a general form applying to any numbers or classes. For example,
addition of natural numbers, as in the famous proof that \(1 + 1 = 2\)
in &lowast;110&middot;04, is proved for the special case of the
addition of classes that applies to cardinal numbers,
&lsquo;\(+_c\)&rsquo;. The Prefatory Statement introduces the
notion of <em>homogeneous cardinals</em>, which are classes of similar
classes whose members are all of the same type. It is possible to
define similarity between two classes \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) of
distinct types, say \(\tau\) and \(\tau '\), and cardinals are
classified as <em>descending</em> or <em>ascending</em> as
the domain of the relevant similarity relation is of a higher type
than the range, or of a lower type, respectively. The theory of
cardinal numbers is straightforward with homogeneous cardinals,
however the exceptions must be kept in mind, as is evidenced in
&lowast;100.</p>

<h3 id="PartIIICardArit">5.2 Part III: Cardinal Arithmetic</h3>

<h5 id="DefiCardNumb">Definition of cardinal numbers</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗100·01} \rN_c \eqdf \{ x \mid \forall y (y \in x \leftrightarrow \forall z \forall w (z,w \in y \leftrightarrow z \approx w) \} \]

<p>
<em>Cardinal numbers</em> are classes of equinumerous (similar)
classes. We can add a notion of the <em>number</em> of a class to
allow for a direct comparison with Frege:</p> 
\[\# \{x \mid \phi ( x) \} \eqdf \{ y \mid y \approx \{x \mid \phi (x) \} \}.\]

<p>
(In set theory of course this is too large to be a set, and so is just
a &ldquo;proper class&rdquo;.)</p>

<h5 id="HumePrinPM">Hume&rsquo;s Principle in PM</h5>

<p>
<em>Hume&rsquo;s principle</em> is described in Frege 1884
(&sect;63) as asserting that the content of the proposition that
&ldquo;the number which belongs to the concept F is the same as the
number which belongs to the concept G&rdquo;, is equivalent to
&ldquo;the concept F is similar to the concept G&rdquo;. In terms of
classes this becomes \(\alpha \approx \beta \equiv \# \alpha = \#
\beta\). Hume&rsquo;s principle is the focus of much of the discussion
of &ldquo;Neo-Logicism&rdquo;, the doctrine that Frege&rsquo;s
construction of the numbers can be built on a consistent foundation
(see the entry on
 <a href="../frege-theorem/">Frege&rsquo;s theorem</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Only one direction of this equivalence is provable in PM:</p>

\[ \tag*{∗100·321} \alpha \approx \beta \supset \# \alpha = \# \beta \]

<p>
The failure of the other direction, the implication from right to
left, is due to the possibility that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are of
different types, so that any similarity relation between them will
have its domain and range in different types. Suppose there are
\(\aleph_0\) individuals, and consider two higher types with the
cardinals in them of even larger, but distinct,
cardinalities: say, \(\alpha\) in some high type with
cardinality \(\aleph_1\) and \(\beta\) in an even higher type
with cardinality \(\aleph_2\). There are no sets of individuals
similar to \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\), so no similarity relation with a
domain in \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\) will hold with respect to any set in
the type of individuals. Suppose that \(\#\) is defined in terms of
such <em>descending</em> relation. Therefore \(\# \alpha = \{ \Lambda
\} = 0\) and \(\# \beta = \{ \Lambda \} = 0\) so \(\# \alpha = \#
\beta\), yet \(\alpha \not\approx \beta\) on any similarity relation
of whatever domain and range, because their cardinalities differ.
Whitehead and Russell assert that the case of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)
being in different types is the only way to construct an exception to
this direction of Hume&rsquo;s principle, and offer as a restricted
version:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗100·34} \exists \gamma [\gamma \in (\alpha \cap \beta) ] \supset ( \alpha \approx \beta \equiv \# \alpha = \# \beta ) \]

<p>
The antecedent guarantees that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are of the
same type, and so the cardinal numbers involved are <em>homogeneous
cardinals</em>. (Landini (2016) argues that this section of PM is
confused.)</p>

<h5 id="Defi">0 Defined</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗101·1} 0 \eqdf \# \emptyset \]

<p>
The class of all classes equinumerous with the empty set is just the
singleton containing the empty set, so \(0 = \{ \emptyset \}\).</p>

<h5 id="AritSumClasCard">The <em>Arithmetical Sum</em> of Classes and Cardinals</h5> 
\[ \tag*{∗110·01} \alpha + \beta \eqdf [\{ \beta \cap \emptyset \} \times \{\alpha \}] \cup [ \{ \alpha \times \{ \beta \} ] \]

<p>
(If \( \alpha, \beta \neq \emptyset \) , otherwise \( \alpha +
\emptyset = \alpha, \emptyset + \beta = \beta \) ). This qualification
is hidden in PM by the use of expressions for functional relations
that are sometimes undefined. The <em>arithmetic sum</em> of
\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is the union of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)
after they are made disjoint by summing the pairing the elements of
\(\beta\) with elements of \(\{ \alpha \}\) and the elements of
\(\alpha\) with the elements of \(\{ \beta \}\). (The <em>Cartesian
product</em> of \( \gamma \) and \( \delta \), \( \gamma \times \delta
\), is \( \{ \langle x, y \rangle | x \in \gamma \; \amp \; y \in
\delta \} \)). The classes \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are intersected
with the empty class, \(\emptyset\), to adjust the type of the
elements of the sum. It is more recognizable to contemporary set
theory by the equivalent definition (subject to the same exception
when :</p> 
\[\alpha + \beta \eqdf \{ \langle \emptyset, x \rangle | x \in \alpha \} \cup \{ \langle y, \emptyset \rangle | y \in \beta \} \]

<p>
\(y +_c x\) expresses the <em>cardinal addition</em> of cardinals
<em>y</em> and <em>x</em>. It is the arithmetical sum of
&ldquo;homogeneous cardinals&rdquo;, cardinals of a uniform type, to
which \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are related by \(\rN_0 c\) (itself
defined at [&lowast;103&middot;01]). The notation indicating that
\(\alpha\) is a homogeneous cardinal \(\alpha\) is \(\rN_0
c\pmsq\alpha\), which we might write as \(\#_0\) in an extension of
our contemporary notation replacing \(\#\) above.</p>

<p>
The reader can now appreciate the notorious fact that \(1 +1=2\), the
most elementary truth of arithmetic, is not proved until page 83 of
Volume II of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, and even then, almost as
an afterthought:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗110·643} 1 +_c 1 = 2 \]

<p>
Whitehead and Russell remark that &ldquo;The above proposition is
occasionally useful. It is used at least three times,
in&hellip;&rdquo;. This witticism reminds us that the theory of
natural numbers, so central to Frege&rsquo;s works, appears in PM as
only a special case of a general theory of cardinal and ordinal
numbers and even more general classes of isomorphic structures.</p>

<h5 id="Expo">Exponentiation</h5>

<p>
Exponentiation for cardinals is defined in such a way that it
coincides with Cantor&rsquo;s notion that the cardinality of the
powerset of a class \(\alpha\) is 2 raised to the power of the
cardinality of \(\alpha\):</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗116·72} \lvert\lvert \wp \alpha \rvert\rvert = 2^{\lvert\lvert \alpha \rvert\rvert } \]

<h5 id="GreaLess">Greater and Less</h5>

<p>
Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗117·661} 2^{y} &gt; y \]

<p>
This is Cantor&rsquo;s theorem that the if a set \(\alpha\) has a
cardinal number <em>y</em> then the cardinal number \(2^{y}\) of the
powerset of \(\alpha\) is greater than <em>y</em>.</p>

<h5 id="NatuNumb">The Natural Numbers</h5>

<p>
The most direct comparison with Frege&rsquo;s development of the
natural numbers comes with the notion of <em>inductive cardinal</em>,
by which PM means the natural numbers 0, 1, 2,&hellip;, and the theory
of these numbers including the principle of induction. Although the
numbers 0 and 1, as well as addition of natural numbers \(+_c\) ,
have been defined earlier, they are defined as cardinal numbers
and addition will apply to all cardinal numbers, finite and
transfinite. For the finite natural numbers, special notions need to
be defined first. For the proof of the Peano postulates it is
necessary not only to define 0, but also the notion of
<em>successor</em>. For Frege the notion of (weak) predecessor of a
number is defined, thus 0 and 1 are the predecessors of 1, while 0, 1
and 2 are the predecessors of 2, etc. The successor of <em>n</em> is
then defined by counting the predecessors of <em>n</em>.  This
definition would not work for PM, where Frege&rsquo;s successor of
each number would be of a yet higher type. There will in fact be
natural numbers for each type in PM, thus a set of all individuals of
type 0, a set of sets of type 1, etc., for each type. There is no one
type, however, at which there are all of the natural numbers (sets of
equinumerous sets of that type) without an assumption that there are
infinitely many members of some one type.</p>

<p>
The solution in PM is to guarantee that for each finite set of
<em>n</em> individuals of type 0, there will be some object not in
that set, which can be included in the set defining the successor.
That such a new individual can be found is guaranteed by the axiom of
infinity, which in effect asserts the existence of distinct
individuals of any finite number. It is interesting to note the
&ldquo;axiom&rdquo; of infinity is not a <em>primitive
proposition</em> of the logic of PM. Instead it is an additional
hypothesis, to be used as an antecedent to mathematical assertions
upon which it depends. The issue of whether the system of PM succeeds
as <em>logicism</em> is thus not settled by noting that an axiom of
infinity has to be assumed, but by determining whether that
&ldquo;axiom&rdquo; is derivable from logical principles alone.</p>

<p>
In axiomatic set theory the &ldquo;axiom of infinity&rdquo; guarantees
the existence of a particular set, the ordinal \(\omega\):</p>

\[ \exists x [ \emptyset \in x \amp \forall y ( y \in x \supset y \cup \{ y\} \in x ) ] \]

<p>
The <em>inductive cardinals</em> (natural numbers) are defined as the
numbers bearing the ancestral of the \(+_1\) relation to 0. Given that
the \(+_1\) relation is the PM account of <em>successor</em>, this is
the same definition as for Frege.</p>

<p>
<em>Inductive Cardinals</em> N</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗120·01} \rN \eqdf \{x\mid 0 \relSast x \} \]

<p>
The <em>inductive cardinals</em> N are the familiar <em>natural
numbers</em>, namely 0 and all those cardinal numbers that are related
to 0 by the ancestral of the &ldquo;successor relation&rdquo;
<em>S</em>, where \(x\relS y\) just in case \(y = x +1\).</p>

\[ \tag*{∗120·03} \textrm{Axiom of Infinity} \eqdf \forall y ( y \in \{x\mid 0\relSast x \} \supset y \neq \emptyset ) \]

<p>
This axiom of infinity asserts that all inductive cardinals are
non-empty. (Recall that \(0 = \{\emptyset \}\), and so 0 is not
empty.) The axiom is not a &ldquo;primitive proposition&rdquo; but
instead to be listed as an &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; where used, that
is as the antecedent of a conditional, where the consequent will be
said to depend on the axiom. Technically is not an <em>axiom</em> of
PM as &lowast;120&middot;03 is a <em>definition</em>, so this is just
further defined notation in PM!</p>

<p>
Whitehead and Russell do carry out the step of the logicist program of
deriving Peano&rsquo;s postulates based on the prior definitions of
the notions of natural number, 0, and successor, as Russell describes
the project later (Russell 1919). This is in fact what is done in
PM&rsquo;s &lowast;120 &ldquo;Inductive Cardinals&rdquo;, but it is
not described as such, either there or in introductory material. The
results are not proved separately, but as they appear in a development
of various results about natural numbers. Indeed some, such as
&lowast;120&middot;31, can only be seen to be versions of a Peano
axiom with a bit of work.</p>

<ol>

<li>0 is a natural number. 
\[ \tag*{∗120·12} 0 \in \rN \]
</li>

<li>The successor of any number is a number. 
\[ \tag*{∗120·121} n \in \rN \supset n +_c 1 \in \rN \]
</li>

<li>No two numbers have the same successor (assuming the axiom of
infinity). 
\[ \tag*{∗120·31} \ \textrm{Axiom of Infinity} \supset (n +_{c} 1 = m +_{c} 1 \supset n = m) \]
</li>

<li style="list-style-type:none">Given the way that the successor
operation is defined, it is not a matter of logic that there is an
extra individual to add to a set of size <em>n</em> to give one of
size \(n +_{c} 1\). This is guaranteed by adding the axiom of infinity
as an hypothesis to the theorem.</li>

<li>0 is not the successor of any number. 
\[ \tag*{∗120·124} n +_{c} 1 \neq 0 \]
</li>

<li>Any property \(\phi\) which belongs to 0, and belongs to the
successor of <em>m</em> provided that it belongs to <em>m</em>,
belongs to all natural numbers <em>n</em>. 
\[ \tag*{∗120·13} \forall n \{ [ n \in \rN \; \amp \; \forall m( \phi m \supset \phi (m +_c 1)) \; \amp \; \phi \: 0] \supset \phi n \} \]
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In contemporary set theory the notion of the successor of a number is
defined directly for the ordinals as \(s(x) = x \cup \{x \} \) rather
than by adding 1, and addition is defined using the familiar recursive
definition:</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
x + 0 &amp; = x\\
 x + s(y) &amp; = s (x + y) 
\end{align} \]

<p>
The use of recursive definitions is justified by a theorem proving
that they describe a unique function. The induction axiom is justified
by showing that any class that contains 0, and for any number
<em>n</em> contains \(s(n)\), will contain all of the numbers in
\(\omega\). The existence of \(\omega\) is guaranteed by the ZF axiom
of infinity.</p>

<p>
At this point, after 225 pages in Volume II, the reader will see how
to compare the logicist reduction of arithmetic in PM with rival
accounts of Frege and of contemporary set theory.</p>

<p>
Frege completes his development of the natural numbers at page 68 of
Volume II of his <em>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</em>, published in 1903,
which follows the 250 pages of Volume I that had been published in
1893. So both Frege and the authors of PM took great pains to prove
more advanced theorems only after a chain of closely argued lemmas
based on their own formalized symbolic logic.</p>

<p>
Frege ends his deductions of the laws of arithemtic with results about
the notions of 0, successor, and the principle of induction which
include the Peano axioms. He does not consider arithmetical functions,
such as addition or multiplication, and thus does not define the
successor of a number <em>n</em> as the result of adding 1 to
<em>n</em>.</p>

<p>
Frege&rsquo;s account is streamlined in other ways as well. He had
always considered the analysis of simple identity sentences to be
important to his logicism, dating back to the <em>Begriffsschrift</em>
(1879), on through his <em>Foundations of Arithmetic</em> (1884) and
his &ldquo;On Sense and Reference&rdquo; (1892), and even in the
appearance of the example &ldquo;\(2^2 = 2 + 2\)&rdquo; in the
foreword to the <em>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</em>. Indeed the analysis
of identity sentences is the starting point of his introduction of the
theory of sense and reference in 1879, yet Frege does not diverge from
his project enough to show how such an identity would be proved. So
Whitehead and Russell might well have wanted to include their proof of
\(1+1 = 2\) at &lowast;110&middot;643 as a reminder of the analysis of
mathematical equations in PM using the &ldquo;descriptive
functions&rdquo; of &lowast;30 and then the account of definite
descriptions in &lowast;14.</p>

<p>
Frege also does not construct the general theory of the arithmetic of
cardinal and ordinal numbers that occupies PM for much of Part III.
Indeed, after the theorems on arithmetic in &sect;54, which concludes
Part II of <em>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</em>, Frege jumps directly to
the topic of real numbers for the remainder of Volume II.
Judged simply on the amount of theorems that had to be proved in
leading to the account of Peano arithmetic, PM does not differ wildly
from Frege&rsquo;s earlier attempt.</p>

<p>
Admittedly the system of PM would be an indirect and cumbersome
system to develop if the theory of arithmetic were the only goal in
mind. Firstly, however, the system of the ramified theory of types is
independently interesting for the foundations of logic that it
provides. After &lowast;20 the theory of classes, and the development
of general notions of arithmetic for relations which follows,
do present the arithmetic of the natural numbers as a special
case which can be generalized to the arithmetic of ordinal and
cardinal numbers, all in a logic with a simple hierarchy of types. The
survey below of what follows in Volume II and Volume III shows the
particular way of developing the theory of rational and then real
numbers that PM follows. The results in set theory will seem
primitive, as the results are dated to around 1908, at just the point
when axiomatic set theory began its extraordinary development.
Whitehead and Russell were not active contributors to set theory and
so PM should not be studied for later technical results that may have
been anticipated here. Russell summarized results in PM from the
current state of the study of infinite cardinals and ordinals in a
paper he give in Paris called &ldquo;On the Axioms of the Infinite and
Transfinite&rdquo; (Russell 1911). There is, however, one result
concerning two notions of infinity that appears to originate with
PM.</p>

<h5 id="DedeInfi">Dedekind Infinity</h5>

<p>
In PM a class is a <em>finite</em> &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; class if
and only if it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the
natural numbers less than or equal to some natural number \(n\). It
will be <em>infinite</em> if and only if it is not inductive.</p>

<p>
A class is <em>Dedekind infinite</em> (r<em>eflexive</em>) if and only
if it can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset
of itself.</p>

<p>
The key theorem in this section is:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗124·57} \textrm{If } y \textrm{ is not inductive then } 2^{2^y} \textrm{ is reflexive.} \]

<p>
The inductive and reflexive notions of infinity coincide if one
assumes that axiom of choice. This result does not assume the axiom of
choice.</p>

<p>
George Boolos (1994: 27) describes the details of this argument and
quotes J.R. Littlewood as saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
He [Russell] has a secret craving to have proved <em>some</em>
straight mathematical theorem. As a matter of fact there <em>is</em>
one: &ldquo;\(2^{2^{\alpha}} &gt; \aleph_0\) if \(\alpha\) is
infinite&rdquo;. Perfectly good mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As use of the axiom of choice is explicitly indicated, and many
results do not use it, the unique contribution to set theory of PM may
be in its indication of what can be proved without assuming
choice.</p>

<h3 id="PartIVRelaArit">5.3 Part IV: Relation Arithmetic</h3>

<p>
<em>Relation arithmetic</em> is the study of the generalization of
cardinal and ordinal numbers to classes of similar classes where
similarity is based on an arbitrary relation. A relation <em>P</em> is
similar to a relation <em>Q</em> if there is a one-to-one
relation <em>S</em> (a <em>correlator</em>) relating the domain of
<em>P</em> to the domain of <em>Q</em> so that if \(x\relP y\) for
some <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> then if \(x\relS w\) and \(w\relQ z\)
then \(z \relbS y\). The mapping <em>S</em> is an isomorphism between
the relations <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. A <em>relation number</em>
will then be a class of relations that are similar to each other.
Relation arithmetic then generalizes the notions of cardinal
arithmetic, such as sum and product, to arbitrary relation numbers.
Russell himself expressed regret that the material in Part IV of PM
was not more carefully studied by his contemporaries (Russell 1959:
86). If a series \( \relP \) is well-ordered, then the class of
relations ordinally similar to \( \relP \) will be an ordinal number.
The sums of ordinal numbers are studied in Tarski 1956, but there has
been little interest in the more general notion of relation arithmetic
presented in these sections of PM. See Solomon 1989.</p>

<em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are <em>similar ordinally</em>,

such if \(x\relP y\), \(x \relS z\), and \( z \relQ w \) then \(w

is defined as:</p> 
\[\begin{align}

 &amp;\quad\{ \langle x, y \rangle | \; x\relP y \lor x \relQ y \lor [ \exists z (z\relP x \lor x\relP z)\; \amp \; \exists z (z\relQ y \lor y\relQ z ) ] \} 
\end{align}\]

<p>
As it is put in the headnote to &lowast;160:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;we may regard the sum of <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> as a
relation which holds between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> when either

the <em>P</em>-series and <em>y</em> belongs to the

<p>
The <em>product</em> of series <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>, \(Q \otimes

members of the <em>field</em> of <em>Q</em> as follows. (This should
not be confused with the more familiar notion of <em>relative

if the relata of the two couples are equal while the referent of the

<p>
(Notice that while the \( sum \) of two binary relations is a binary
relation, their \( product \) is a relation between pairs. This is the
generalization from classes to relations of the fact that the
cardinality of the relative product of two classes is the cardinality
of the class of ordered pairs of elements taken one from each.) It is
possible to prove results that show the differences between products
and sums of relations and of numbers. The product of relations is
associative:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗166·42} (P \otimes Q) \otimes R \text{ is ordinally similar to } P \otimes (Q \otimes R) \]

<p>
The relations distribute in one way:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗166·45} (Q \oplus R) \otimes P = (Q \otimes P) \oplus (R \otimes P) \]

<p>
However, it does not hold in general that:</p> 
\[P \otimes (Q \oplus R) = (P \otimes Q) \oplus (P \otimes R).\]

<p>
For the purposes of defining rational and real numbers as relations
between relations, it is necessary to define the ordering relation
between individuals related by the relation, that is, in the domain or
range (the <em>field</em>) of the relations. This is described in the
summary of &lowast;170 and a theorem as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;\(\alpha\) is said to precede \(\beta\)&hellip;if we consider
the two classes \(\alpha - \beta\) and \(\beta - \alpha\), there are
members of \(\alpha - \beta\) which are not preceded by any members of
\(\beta - \alpha\). (Vol. II, 1912: 411 and 1927: 399)</p>

 </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The notions of the sum and product of relation numbers
are defined as the relation numbers of the sum and product of the
relations, with adjustments made so that the types of the relations
are uniform, and the numbers contain disjoint relations, as was seen
in the definition of sum for cardinal numbers in &lowast;110 above. If
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are relation numbers, their sum is \(x
\dot{+} y\) and the product is \(x \dot{\times} y\).</p>

<p>
It is proved that the operation of sum for relation numbers has other properties that directly follow from
the corresponding properties of the sums and products of relations.
Among these many theorems is the fact that sum for relation numbers is
associative:</p> 
\[ \tag*{∗180·56} ( y \dot{+} x ) \dot{+} \rho = y \dot{+} ( x \dot{+} \rho) \]

A <em>series</em> (<em>linear ordering</em>) is defined as a relation
that is <em>irreflexive</em> \(\forall x (\lnot x\relR x)\),
<em>transitive</em> \(\forall x \forall y \forall z (x\relR y \amp
y\relR z \supset x\relR z)\), and <em>connected</em> \(\forall x
\forall y (x\relR y \lor y\relR x)\). (&lowast;204&middot;01) (These
properties are restricted to a specific domain for each relation. Thus
a connected relation will hold between any two members of a given

<h5 id="Sequ">Sequents</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>
Thus sequents of \(\alpha\) are its immediate successors. If
\(\alpha\) has a maximum, the sequents are the immediate successors of
the maximum; but if \(\alpha\) has no maximum, there will be no one
term of \(\alpha\) which is immediately succeeded by a sequent of
\(\alpha\); in this case, if \(\alpha\) has a single sequent, the
sequent is the &ldquo;upper limit&rdquo; of \(\alpha\). (PM Vol. II,
&ldquo;Summary of &lowast;205&rdquo;, 1912: 577 or 1927: 559)</p>

<p>
In other words,  the relation \(R\) such as \( \pmlt \) is
<em>Dedekindian</em> when every class \(\alpha \) has either a maximum
or a sequent with respect to \( R \). This is the standard definition by which every
segment with an upper bound has a least upper bound. That least upper
bound will either be the maximum of the set or the least individual
greater than all members of the set.</p>

It can be shown that every well-ordered series has an ordinal

has an ordinal number, \(\Omega\) say. But in that case the series of
all ordinals including \(\Omega\) has the ordinal number \(\Omega +
1\), which must be greater than \(\Omega\), Hence \(\Omega\) is not
the ordinal number of all ordinals. (PM Vol. I, 1925: 61 and 1910:

In &lowast;256 we find the resolution of the Burali-Forti
contradiction in observing the relative types of classes of ordinals.
Ordinal numbers, as classes of isomorphic series, will be of a higher
type than their members. The purported &ldquo;ordinal number of all
ordinal numbers&rdquo; \(\Omega\) will be restricted to a type above
the type of the ordinals that are its members. Just as there is no
class of all classes (of some type or other) there is also no ordinal
of all ordinal numbers.</p>

<p>
Theorem &lowast;256&middot;56 demonstrates that &ldquo;in higher types
there are greater ordinals than any to be found in lower
types&rdquo; (PM Vol. III, 1927: 75).</p>

<h5 id="ZermTheo">Zermelo&rsquo;s Theorem</h5>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">&lowast;258&middot;326</span><span class="sen">
Assuming the axiom of choice, every set can be
well-ordered.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
This proof of Zermelo&rsquo;s theorem follows Zermelo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;new proof&rdquo; (Zermelo 1908). Together with
&lowast;250&middot;51 this shows that the axiom of choice is
equivalent to the well-ordering principle.</p>

<h5 id="TranAnceRela">The Transfinite Ancestral Relation</h5>

<p>
The discussion of &ldquo;transfinitely hereditary&rdquo; properties in
&lowast;257 constitutes the discussion of &ldquo;transfinite
induction&rdquo; that Russell pointed out to Reichenbach in the
discussion reported above from Russell 1959: 86.</p>

<h5 id="FiniOrdi">Finite Ordinals</h5>

<p>
It is shown in &lowast;262 that every infinite well-ordered series
consists of a series (well-ordered set) of progressions. (\(\omega\)
orderings.)</p>

<h5 id="SeriAlep">The Series of Alephs</h5>

<p>
A result of Hausdorff (1906), that \(\omega_1\), the first uncountable
ordinal, is not the limit of a progression of smaller ordinals,
is shown to follow if one assumes the axiom of choice
(&lowast;265&middot;49). It is then conjectured that this cannot be
shown without relying on the axiom of choice. See Grattan-Guinness
2000: 403 for a discussion of Hausdorff&rsquo;s influence on the
content of PM.</p>

<p>
Dorothy Wrinch, who had been a member of Russell&rsquo;s circle of
unofficial students during the war, published in 1919 an article on
Dedekindian series of ordinal numbers. She describes the result as
investigating &ldquo;necessary and sufficient conditions that \(P^Q\)
should be Dedekindian or semi-Dedekindian when <em>P</em> and
<em>Q</em> are well ordered series&rdquo; (Wrinch 1919: 219). This
study follows up the result in &lowast;124 that is described in Boolos
1994, as an investigation of the arithmetic of ordinals without
assuming the axiom of choice. Wrinch&rsquo;s paper not only follows
the notation of PM, but also makes use of theorems up to the end of
section V on Series, with numbers following the dot, and so could
easily be added as &lowast;277. Russell intended to found a school of
&ldquo;mathematical philosophy&rdquo;, and of course succeeded in
attracting Ludwig Wittgenstein to the foundational issues in PM, but
there is no other indication of logicians attempting to set their
results in the framework of PM.</p>

<h3 id="PartVIQuan">6.2 Part VI: Quantity</h3>

<p>
The later portions of PM should thus be studied for a hint of how the
real numbers and the use of mathematics in measurement can be
developed with this rival foundation on the theory of relations.
Gandon (2008, 2012) argues that the application of mathematics is
better explained using this logicist account than by rivals.</p>

<p>
In &lowast;300&ndash;&lowast;314, positive and negative integers,
ratios and real numbers are all defined. The goal of the section is to
begin the study of how these numbers are used in the measurement of
quantities in geometry and physics.</p>

<h5 id="Rati">Ratios</h5> 
\[ R n/m S \eqdf \forall x \forall y ( x\rels{R^n} y \supset x\rels{S^m}y) \]

<p>
for <em>n</em>, <em>m</em> relatively prime.</p>

<p>
Relations <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> stand in the <em>ratio</em> of
<em>n</em> to <em>m</em> when \(x\rels{R^n} y\) then \(x\rels{S^m}
y\), where \(R^n\) is the <em>n</em>-th power of <em>R</em> and
\(S^m\) is the <em>m</em>-th power of <em>S</em> (see &lowast;91). The
ratio of two relations is represented by numbers <em>n</em> and
<em>m</em> that are <em>relatively prime</em>, namely, if</p>

\[\forall j \forall k \forall l [(n = j \times l \amp m = k \times l )\supset l = 1].\]

<p>
<em>Ratios</em> thus are relations between relations. <em>Rational
numbers</em>, in keeping with the generalized notions of all numbers
in PM, will be classes of similar ratios, and thus the work of
developing the theory of rational, and then real numbers, is carried
out in terms of ratios and relations between ratios.</p>

<h5 id="RealNumb">Real Numbers</h5>

<p>
The real numbers \(\Theta\) are defined as &ldquo;the series of
segments of the series of ratios&rdquo;, or the set of Dedekind cuts
of the sequence of rational numbers, in their standard ordering.
Technically \(\Theta\) is a relation in extension. The individuals
that are related in the ratios, and thus at the basis of the series of
rational numbers, must be infinite in number for the PM version of the
real numbers to have the structure we expect. In the introductory
material to the section Whitehead and Russell point out that while the
construction of the reals thus requires the axiom of infinity, they
add it the axiom as an assumption to the theorems where needed and try as much as
possible to derive results upon which do not rely on it.  


<p>
The theory of real numbers in PM is closer to that of Frege than the
&ldquo;arithmetizing&rdquo; accounts of Dedekind or Cantor. Dedekind
postulated that irrational numbers are to be &ldquo;created&rdquo; to
fill out the gaps in the series of rational numbers that are marked by
Dedekind cuts (Dedekind 1872 [1901: 15]), while Cantor (1883: &sect;9,
para. 8 [1996: 899]) identified real numbers with the limits of
sequences of rational numbers.</p>

<p>
Frege, and PM, however, see real numbers as abstracted from the
similiarity of relations with a certain structure. See Gandon
2012 for a fine-grained comparison of the Frege and Russell
constructions.</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that the overall structure and contents of
sections in PM and <em>Basic Laws</em> are similar. They both share a
first section on the symbolic logic that they will use, then a series
of definitions and theorems about the notions of number and concepts
used in arithmetic, with a concluding section on real numbers. While
the range of the mathematics that is to be reduced to logic in the two
works is the same, Frege restricts his work more directly to natural
and real numbers, while PM includes the theory of classes and the
arithmetic of relations and some basic theorems about infinite sets. While all of these topics are
handled in the initial chapters of a contemporary textbook in
axiomatic set theory, as Urquhart (2013) suggests, this may be the
inevitable fate of even the most groundbreaking mathematical
works. </p>

<p>
The addition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in
the next sections as they are for other numbers, but taking disjoint
instances of each number similarity class, and performing the
corresponding operation on them. Many results assume the axiom of
infinity as an hypothesis. The operations are symbolized as \(+_s\)
and \(\times_s\).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Measurement&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> the application of ratios and real
numbers to magnitudes&mdash;will be dealt with in Section C; for the
present, we shall confine ourselves to those properties of magnitude
which are presupposed by measurement.&hellip;</p>

<p>
We conceive of a magnitude as a vector, <em>i.e.</em> as an operation,
<em>i.e.</em> as a descriptive function in the sense of &lowast;30.
Thus for example, we shall so define our terms that 1 gramme would not
be a magnitude, but the difference between 2 grammes and 1 gramme
would be a magnitude, <em>i.e.</em> the relation &ldquo;+1
gramme&rdquo; would be a magnitude. On the other hand a centimetre and
a second would both be magnitudes according to our definition, because
distances in space and time are vectors.&hellip;</p>

<p>
We demand of a vector (1) that it shall be a one-one relation, (2)
that it be capable of indefinite repetition, <em>i.e.</em> that if the
vector takes us from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>, there shall always be a
point <em>c</em> such that the vector takes us from <em>b</em> to
<em>c</em>. (PM, Vol. III, &ldquo;Summary of Section B&rdquo;, 1913:
339, 1927: 339)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kinds of quantity addressed in this section and the next are
all</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>vector families</em> that is, classes of one-one relations all
having the same converse domain, and all having the domain contained
in the converse domain. (PM Vol. III, 1927: 350)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="Meas">6.2.1 Measurement</h4>

<p>
Measurement in PM is based on the relations between objects that are
the basis for the operation of measuring, that one object is heavier
than another, or longer than another. Quantities are then equivalence
classes of objects which have the same relations to others. Operations
are defined on quantities, so that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;that is to say, two-thirds of a pound of cheese ought to be
\((2/3 \times_s 1/2)\) of a pound of cheese, and similarly in every
other case. (PM, Volume III, 1927: 407)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
PM concludes with a seemingly dangling excursion into the special case
of the measurement of &ldquo;cyclic families&rdquo;. For &ldquo;such
cases as the angles at a point, or the elliptic straight line, we
require a theory of measurement applicable to families which are not
open&rdquo; (PM, Volume III, 1927: 457). The angles at a point will be
measured from 0 to 360 degrees, and then start over again at 0 to
measure an object rotating around a point. The many ratios that
represent the rotations are represented by a &ldquo;principal
ratio&rdquo;, which is used to assign the measurement of degrees.</p>

<h4 id="TherNoConcEndPM">6.2.2 There is No &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo; at the End of PM</h4>

<p>
PM ends abruptly with the proof of a theorem (&lowast;375&middot;32)
concerning cyclic families, without any concluding remarks or hint of
what is to come later. The thought is that further mathematics,
including the Volume IV that Whitehead was to write on geometry, would
have to be developed piecemeal. First the notions of a given branch of
mathematics would have to be defined in terms of earlier notions, such
as classes of relations with a given structure, and then the important
basic results in that field would be proved one by one, in the style
of the work so far. Establishing logicism would be an ongoing project,
as open-ended as mathematics itself.</p>
