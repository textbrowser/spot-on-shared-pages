<h1>Alberic of Paris</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Oct 28, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Alberic of Paris, also known as Alberic de Monte, was, according to
his contemporaries, one of the most prominent philosophers in Paris in
the twelfth century, a period in which the Latin-speaking West saw a
marked revitalization of philosophical and scientific learning, and in
which Paris rose to become its leading educational center. Alberic was
the main rival to Peter Abelard (1079&ndash;1142) and, in the words of
one of his pupils, &ldquo;a most fierce opponent of the nominalist
school&rdquo;&mdash;that is, of Abelard and his followers (John of
Salisbury, <em>Metalogicon</em>, 2.10). He is best known for having
proved that Abelard&rsquo;s logic was, on its own axioms,
inconsistent.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Prior to the foundation of the University of Paris in c. 1200, the
Parisian educational scene was dominated mainly by individual teachers
who taught, often in rented quarters, at various places in and around
the city. It was a dynamic and fiercely competitive environment in
which masters vied keenly with each other to attract fame and
students, great numbers of which flocked to Paris from far and wide.
The most influential teachers acquired dedicated followings, and the
five most dominant of these &ldquo;schools of thought&rdquo; (<em lang="la">sectae</em>)
were the Nominales (aka Vocales), the
Parvipontani (aka Adamitae), the Porretani (aka Gilbertini), the
Melidunenses (aka Robertini) and the Albricani (aka Montani). The
Nominales were the followers of Peter Abelard, the Parvipontani those
of Adam of the Petit Pont (aka Adam of Balsham), the Porretani were
the followers of Gilbert Porreta (aka Gilbert of Poitiers) and the
Melidunenses were those of Robert of Melun; the Albricani were the
followers of Alberic (Iwakuma &amp; Ebbesen 1992; Courtenay 2009;
Goubier &amp; Rosier-Catach 2019; Marenbon &amp; Hansen 2022; Hansen,
Donato, &amp; Schuman forthcoming a).</p>

<p>
Alberic taught in the area of the Abbey of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve,
located on the left bank of the Seine, where the Pantheon is today. It
was then a hill on the outskirts of town, and it is from this hill,
Mont Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, that Alberic appears to have acquired
his cognomen &ldquo;de Monte&rdquo; (Courtenay 2009: 38; Hansen,
Donato, &amp; Schuman forthcoming a). In modern scholarship, he is
usually referred to as Alberic of Paris. This practice has no medieval
precedent, but it is long standing and was seemingly established
centuries ago in order to distinguish him from other twelfth-century
Alberics, with some of whom, Alberic of Rheims in particular, he has
often been confused (Hansen, Donato, &amp; Schuman forthcoming a). The
medieval sources usually refer to him simply as master Alberic (<em lang="la">magister
Albericus</em>), and the only extant medieval
source to actually use the cognomen &ldquo;de Monte&rdquo; did not
surface until the 1960s (Huygens 1962).</p>

<p>
Very little is known about Alberic&rsquo;s life. He may have studied,
and perhaps even taught, under Abelard before setting up his own
school (Courtenay 2009: 39; Hansen, Donato, &amp; Schuman forthcoming
a). He certainly knew Abelard&rsquo;s views very well and seems to
have made his name in part by his fierce opposition to them, much as
how Abelard rose to fame by forcefully attacking the views of his own
teacher William of Champeaux.</p>

<p>
As for Alberic&rsquo;s career as a teacher, the autobiographical
accounts of some of his prominent students allow us to establish some
rough dates for his activity. Thus, John of Salisbury (c.
1115&ndash;1180) tells us that, when in 1136 he went to Paris to
study, he first studied briefly under Peter Abelard, and then:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
After that, when he went away, all too hastily as it seemed to me, I
attached myself to Master Alberic, who stood out among the rest as a
dialectician of the highest renown, and was in point of fact a bitter
opponent of the nominalist school. I thus spent almost two years at
Mont Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, having as my teachers in this art
Alberic and Master Robert of Melun. (John of Salisbury,
<em>Metalogicon</em>, 2.10; trans. Hall)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, William of Tyre (c. 1130&ndash;1186) relates that during the
period he spent studying liberal arts in Paris from c. 1146 to 1155 he
not only studied under a number of principal teachers, but</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
also went to hear others, even if not regularly, then often and
especially for the sake of disputation, all were outstanding men and
worthy of all praise: master Alberic de Monte, master Robert of Melun,
master Mainerus, master Robert Amiclas, master Adam of the Petit Pont.
These seemed to be the major luminaries. (William of Tyre,
<em>Chronicon</em> 19.12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, Alberic was teaching already in the mid-1130s and was still
active for at least part of the period between the mid-1140s to the
mid-1150s. It is also known that at one point he was away from Paris.
According to John of Salisbury, Alberic at some point after John had
studied with him</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
set out for Bologna and unlearned what he had taught; and then indeed
came back and untaught it. Whether for the better must be assessed by
those who heard him before and after. (John of Salisbury,
<em>Metalogicon</em>, 2.10; trans. Hall)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It cannot, at the current state of research, be determined when
precisely and for how long Alberic was in Italy, but it was perhaps in
the 1140s (De Rijk 1962&ndash;67, 1:82&ndash;88; Hansen, Donato, &amp;
Schuman forthcoming a). Nor is it possible to say what his change of
mind consisted in, but some scholars have speculated that it may have
been brought about by access to some of the Aristotelian works that
were coming to be rediscovered and/or translated into Latin in this
period (Courtenay 2009: 36). Previously, philosophers in the Latin
West had developed their views mainly on the basis of a small number
of ancient and late-ancient philosophical texts (Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em> and <em>Peri hermeneias</em> (in translation),
Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> (in translation), and Manlius
Boethius&rsquo; commentaries to these texts and his logical opuscula),
but they were now slowly gaining access to translations of the rest of
Aristotle&rsquo;s logical texts (<em>Sophistical Refutations</em>,
<em>Topics</em>, <em>Prior</em> and <em>Posterior Analytics</em>).
Alberic himself wrote a commentary on the <em>Sophistical
Refutations</em> and may have been the first in the Latin West to do
so (Ebbesen forthcoming).</p>

<p>
It is not known when Alberic stopped teaching, but like the other
great masters of his day his influence seemingly outlasted his tenure;
there were still teachers teaching philosophy on the basis of his
views in the second half of the twelfth century (Hansen, Donato, &amp;
Schuman forthcoming a). On the whole, however, the logical schools
appear to have fizzled out, and there are not many signs of life after
the end of the century (Ebbesen 1992: 77).</p>

<p>
None of Alberic&rsquo;s writings are known to have survived, but there
are many references to his views in the extant logico-philosophical
texts from the twelfth century, attesting to his great influence (De
Rijk 1966; Iwakuma 2013: 27&ndash;28; Hansen, Donato, &amp; Schuman
forthcoming a). Apart from a short list reporting fourteen of
Alberic&rsquo;s main theses (edited in Iwakuma 2013: 30&ndash;31),
these texts are mainly logical treatises and commentaries on the
available works of Aristotle, Porphyry, and Boethius (we refer to
these anonymous logical commentaries using alpha-numerical labels; for
these labels, see Marenbon 1993; 2013b; 2018). This material forms the
basis from which Alberic&rsquo;s ideas have to be pieced together. It
is still very much a work in progress. It is hampered by the fact that
there are as yet no proper scholarly editions of most of the material
transmitted in the medieval manuscripts. It is further complicated by
the fact that these manuscripts transmit the material anonymously, and
that it is mostly difficult to date the material with precision. We do
not know, in other words, exactly when, where and by whom the texts
were composed. Still, many of the texts were clearly written by
followers of Alberic, and besides the explicit references to his views
(and defense of them) they supply much important additional
information for understanding his ideas and his disagreements with
Abelard.</p>

<p>
In what follows, we will attribute to Alberic those views that the
texts explicitly attribute to him. Other distinctive views in the
texts associated with his school&mdash;views not directly attributed
to Alberic, but apparently held by his students&mdash;we will call
Albrican, views of the Albricani. These views may have been developed
by Alberic even though they are not attributed to him in the texts we
have; or they may have been developed by anonymous Albricani; or,
perhaps, they were developed by both. Hopefully, future research will
clarify some of these problems of attribution.</p>

<h2 id="Meta">2. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
In many ways, Alberic&rsquo;s metaphysical views seem to be a response
to and rejection of the antirealism that pervades Abelard&rsquo;s
metaphysics (for Abelard&rsquo;s metaphysics, see, e.g., Tweedale
1976; King 2004; Marenbon 2013a: 167&ndash;99). Be it a matter of
predication, universals or time, Alberic was a realist where Abelard
was not. This was certainly a clash between different metaphysical
sensibilities, but also to some extent a battle over the nature of
Aristotelian logic. Twelfth-century logicians were Peripatetics, heirs
to and carriers of the Aristotelian tradition that, as mentioned
above, had been handed down to them primarily in the logical works of
Aristotle, Porphyry and Boethius; indeed, a considerable part of their
philosophical output consisted in commenting on these foundational
texts. Judging from his views and the writings of his followers,
Alberic was a traditionalist, who sought to develop coherent theories
that aligned more closely with the authoritative texts than did the
views of the Nominalists, whose interpretations the Albricani often
characterize as misguided or distortive (Hansen 2023; Donato
2025).</p>

<h3 id="CatePred">2.1 Categories and Predication</h3>

<p>
Fundamental to Alberic&rsquo;s logic is the idea that logic is
concerned not just with words, but also with things
(<em>Introductiones Montane Minores</em>, 11) His logic, as a result,
is deeply rooted in his metaphysics. A central role in this connection
is played by the notion of predication (Donato 2025). The Albricani
distinguished several types. For one, predication can be a relation
between two linguistic items (names or terms); they found this notion
of predication in Boethius&rsquo; <em>On Topical Differences</em>
(1175b&ndash;c). Secondly, predication can be a relation between two
items in the ontology, that is to say, between two things (<em lang="la">res</em>);
this notion of predication they found in
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> (5.2a19&ndash;27). Thirdly, on
the basis of the same passage in Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em>, they allowed a mixed type of predication where a
linguistic item is predicated of an item in the ontology. As is clear
from the passage in Aristotle from which it derives, this third type
follows on the second: term &ldquo;<em>P</em>&rdquo; is predicated of
thing <em>S</em> because thing <em>P</em> is predicated of thing
<em>S</em>; and it is only natural to think that the same goes for the
first type, so that &ldquo;<em>P</em>&rdquo; is predicated of
&ldquo;<em>S</em>&rdquo; because <em>P</em> is predicated of
<em>S</em> (Hansen 2023: 587&ndash;88; see also Donato forthcoming).
In other words, the second type of predication, what the Albricani
call thing-predication (<em lang="la">praedicatio rerum</em>), is the
more fundamental relation and one that is of central concern to the
logician.</p>

<p>
In line with this conception of logic, Alberic argued that
Boethius&rsquo;s famous claim (inherited from Porphyry) that
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> is a work about &ldquo;the
primary words that signify the primary genera of things in so far as
they signify&rdquo; (<em>in Cat.</em> 161a) was not intended by
Boethius as a fully adequate description of the scope of
Aristotle&rsquo;s work (something Boethius himself signals at <em>in
Cat.</em> 160a). Certainly, the <em>Categories</em> is concerned with
such words, but equally importantly, Alberic argued, it is concerned
with predicates, and predicates, he took it, are fundamentally things
rather than words. More specifically, the <em>Categories</em>
stipulates which things are predicated of which, which things are
removed from which, and which things are neither predicated of nor
removed from which (C15, fol. 1ra, cited in Hansen 2024b:
285&ndash;86). Animal, to take an example, is predicated of Human,
which falls under it in the Porphyrian tree; Human, by contrast, is
removed from Stone, which belongs to a different branch of the tree;
and Human is neither predicated of nor removed from Animal, which sits
at a higher node on the same branch of the tree. As the Albricani,
following Alberic, put it, the more general is predicated of the less
general, opposites are removed from opposites, and the less general is
neither predicated of nor removed from the more general (Hansen 2024b:
286&ndash;87). As we shall see below
 (<a href="#AlbeOwnLogi">&sect; 4.2</a>),
 Alberic&rsquo;s notion of thing-predication and his realist
conception of Aristotle&rsquo;s categories play a central role in his
logic.</p>

<h3 id="Univ">2.2 Universals</h3>

<p>
Alberic&rsquo;s logic harbors an unmistakable commitment to real
universals (Donato 2025). Predicates, as we have seen, are things.
Universals are predicates par excellence. Alberic&rsquo;s fundamental
disagreement with Abelard on this point is clear, and the
nominalists&rsquo; attempts at finding evidence for their theory of
universals in Aristotle are repeatedly mocked in the writings of
Alberic&rsquo;s followers (Iwakuma 2013: 35; Hansen 2023:
573&ndash;74, 588&ndash;89). Curiously, however, the sources are
rather reticent when it comes to information about the details of
Alberic&rsquo;s own view. Indeed, it has been claimed that &ldquo;the
Albricani&rsquo;s works so far known never directly take up the
question of what universals are&rdquo; (Iwakuma 2013: 38). This claim,
however, rests on the rejection of L. M. De Rijk&rsquo;s (1966:
23&ndash;28) attribution to a follower of Alberic of a substantial
commentary on Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> (found in ms Vienna,
&Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek 2486 and known among
specialists as P20/P21); it is a commentary which discusses the matter
at some length (for this commentary, see Marenbon 2018: 184&ndash;85).
As argued convincingly by Donato (forthcoming), however, De
Rijk&rsquo;s attribution is almost certainly correct, and the
commentary does give us an outline of what at least some of the
Albricani took universals to be.</p>

<p>
Again, the discussion takes its point of departure in the
authoritative texts by Aristotle, Porphyry, and Boethius. Basically,
the author of P20/P21 argues, after having sorted through a long list
of authoritative passages, any card-carrying Peripatetic will have to
accept that both names and things are universal. But, he insists,
although a name or term can be universal, it cannot be a universal.
The reason is that according to Aristotle&rsquo;s definition (<em>Peri
hermeneias</em>, 7.17a39&ndash;40) a universal is what is naturally
apt to be predicated of many. Being linguistic items, however, names,
even if apt to be predicated of many, are so by convention and not by
nature. A universal, therefore, is a thing (P20/P21, edited in Donato
forthcoming; cf. Grabmann 1947: 66).</p>

<p>
In the Aristotelian tradition, the problem of universals was usually
phrased as a problem about genera and species, the paradigmatic
examples of universals. Committed to the view that universals are
things, the anonymous Albrican thus seeks to clarify the ontological
implications of his position:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We say that genera and species are located in sensible things, have
their being through them, and are understood separately. That genera
and species have their whole being in individuals, we understand as
follows: the genus Animal has its whole being in the singular animals,
that is to say, the whole nature of Animal is in each animal, but it
is understood separately. For in order that this or that animal exist,
it is necessary that it be a substance, that it be animated, and that
it be capable of sense perception, which is the whole nature of this
genus Animal and its whole being. And in this way, the whole being of
the genus or of the species is located in sensible things, for
universals were created with the very creation of sensible things and
they have their being through them, such that Animal, say, cannot
exist unless this or that animal does. But it can be understood
separately. For we can understand Animal in such a way that it is
neither this nor that animal, because no sensible or distinctive
aspects are considered nor any individual feature. And the same holds
for other secondary substances. (P20, fol. 47ra&ndash;b, cited in De
Rijk 1966: 24; Donato forthcoming)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The author here is not, in other words, advocating some sort of
Platonism according to which universals have extramental existence
apart from individuals; it is, rather, a more moderate version of
realism. Later in his text, he expands on his view by stating more
precisely what he takes species and genera to be. They are, he argues,
sorts of things (<em lang="la">maneriae rerum</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We say that genera and species are sorts of things, as for example the
sort of substance that is Animal is a genus. And just as we say that
the sort of substance that is Animal is a genus, so we say that the
sort of animal that is Human is a species, and so on. (P20/P21, edited
in Donato forthcoming; cf. Grabmann 1947: 68).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
His theory is thus the one of which John of Salisbury, in his
dismissive review of the various theories of universals on offer in
his day, mockingly says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Then there is one who resorts to neologism, not having sufficient
competence in the Latin language. For, on hearing the words
&ldquo;genus&rdquo; or &ldquo;species&rdquo;, he now declares that
they are indeed to be understood as things of a universal kind, and
now interprets them as sorts (<em lang="la">maneries</em>) of things.
I have no idea in which of the <em lang="la">auctores</em> he found
this expression and this distinction, except perhaps among the foreign
words or idioms of modern scholars. And even there I do not see what
it could mean, unless it were a collection of things, as in
Jocelin&rsquo;s view, or a universal thing, though this is loath to be
called a sort. For the word can refer to both, depending on its
interpretation, since &ldquo;sort&rdquo; may denote either a sum of
things or the <em>status</em> in which a thing of such and such a sort
abides. (John of Salisbury, <em>Metalogicon</em> 2.17, trans. Hall,
modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Apart from offering the author of P20/P21 a taste of his own medicine
(there&rsquo;s no authoritative support for saying the genera and
species are &ldquo;sorts&rdquo; of things), John of Salisbury raises
the crucial question: What exactly does it mean to say that genera and
species are sorts of things (<em lang="la">maneries rerum</em>)?</p>

<p>
The author of P20/P21 is rather keen to stress what it does
<em>not</em> mean, namely that there is some thing, the genus or
species, that is located in every one of its several individuals.
Having claimed, as we saw above, that the whole being of animal is in
each human, he seeks to dispel the worry by parsing the locution as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is the same as if one were to say: the whole being of Animal, that
is to say, every property of Animal holds of each human, for it holds
of each human being that it is an animate thing capable of sense
perception. And we understand it in the same way when we say that the
species Human is in each one of its individuals; it is to say nothing
more than that every property of Human, such as being rational, mortal
and able to obtain knowledge, holds of each human. (P20/21, edited in
Donato forthcoming; cf. Grabmann 1947: 69)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This does not seem to give a straightforward answer to the question
what sorts of things (<em lang="la">maneriae rerum</em>) really are
and whether sense can ultimately be made of the idea. Peter King
(1982: 242&ndash;47) was rather dismissive of the prospects, but
Donato (forthcoming) argues on the basis of a new edition of the
relevant part of the text that <em lang="la">maneriae rerum</em> are
best construed as sets of universal properties that inhere in
individuals via their individual forms. As he sees it, however, the
theory thus understood merely pushes the problem of universals back a
step, and as it gives no account of what it means for the universal
properties it posits to hold of several things, fails to actually
solve it. Ultimately, it is unclear whether the theory traces back to
Alberic, but as Donato shows, many claims made by the author of
P20/P21 in his presentation of the theory were commonly held by the
Albricani and some are directly attributed to Alberic elsewhere
(Donato forthcoming). An interesting later trace of the theory can
seemingly be detected in the supposition theory of William of
Sherwood, whose label for the type of simple supposition at stake in a
sentence like &ldquo;Human is a species&rdquo; is &ldquo;manerial
supposition&rdquo; (<em lang="la">suppositio manerialis</em>) (see
Uckelman 2016 [2024]). It can only be hoped that further research on
the writings of the Albricani will shed more light on the theory of
universals found in P20/P21, its connection to Alberic and its later
influence.</p>

<p>
Whether they are things or not was not the only disagreement Alberic
and Abelard had about universals. Another issue, reported in many of
the texts by Alberic&rsquo;s followers, was whether there can be
universals with only one instance. Abelard and the nominalists denied
this (see Hansen 2023: 574 for references). If there were only one
human left in the universe, &ldquo;Human&rdquo; would not actually be
predicated of many, and thus it would fail to be a universal. Alberic,
by contrast, insisted that there can be universals with only a single
instance (De Rijk 1966: 29). Indeed, the Albricani frequently invoke
the phoenix as a stock example of a universal for which this is
necessarily the case: it only ever has one instance at a time (De Rijk
1966: 27; Iwakuma 2013: 32&ndash;33; Hansen 2023: 589, 616&ndash;17).
As the Albricani see it, their view accords well with
Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of universals. As P20/P21 puts it:
&ldquo;Aristotle anticipated this when he said that &lsquo;a universal
is what is naturally apt etc.&rsquo; For he wanted something to be
universal even if it were not predicated actually of several
things&rdquo; (Donato forthcoming). As is clear from the list of
theses ascribed to him, Alberic held as a corollary to this that
&ldquo;it is correct and true to say that &lsquo;every phoenix is an
animal&rsquo;&rdquo; (Iwakuma 2013: 31). Hence Alberic&rsquo;s views
on the nature of universals also directly impacted his account of
logical syntax.</p>

<h3 id="Time">2.3 Time</h3>

<p>
Alberic&rsquo;s reading of Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> and
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> put him and his followers at
odds with Abelard and the Nominalists on a host of issues besides
those already mentioned (see, e.g., De Rijk 1966; Marenbon 1992;
Iwakuma 2013; Cameron 2015; Hansen 2024a; Donato and Hansen
forthcoming). A particularly important disagreement was over the
metaphysics of time. In the <em>Categories</em>, which was the main
source on which twelfth-century philosophers built their theories of
time, Aristotle claims that time is a quantity and that it has parts
(<em>Categories</em>, 6.4b20&ndash;25; 5a6&ndash;8). In this regard,
time is like a line.</p>

<p>
Like Abelard, Alberic was an indivisibilist about lines, and is
reported to have held that lines are ultimately made up of indivisible
points (C17, fol. 84rb, cited in De Rijk 1966: 34; for Abelard, see
King 2004: 93&ndash;95). He appears to have held a similar view about
time, such that instants are to times what points are to lines; the
Albricani at least were committed to this view (Hansen forthcoming),
and Abelard too took instants to be what we might call temporal atoms
(King 2004: 100). A problem, however, arises. For times are not quite
like lines. Most importantly, as Aristotle puts it, the parts of time
do not endure (<em>Categories</em> 6.5a27). In other words, time flows
(Boethius, <em>in Cat.</em> 207c&ndash;d). Take, for example, the
present day. It is made up of 24 hours, but only one of these hours is
present. As it is just past 2pm, the first fourteen hours have passed
and the last nine have yet to come. But how can something be made up
of that which is no longer and that which is not yet? Abelard is clear
what he thinks about the possibility of such temporal wholes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I am not in agreement with this view and do not accept that some
composite ever exists when a part of it does not endure [&hellip;]
Hence, the truth of the matter is that it cannot ever be truly and
properly said of a day that it exists or is a whole or a quantity or
even a thing or anything at all. We do, nonetheless, conceive of it as
if it were a whole. (Abelard, <em>Logica Ingredientibus, Glossae super
Praedicamenta</em>, 187&ndash;88)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On Abelard&rsquo;s view, only the present instant, the currently
obtaining temporal atom, exists. However, if time is essentially
composite, as Aristotle seems to say, Abelard&rsquo;s strict
presentism would appear to do away with the reality of time
altogether. Alberic, therefore, takes a different tack:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Master Alberic says that the past and future are principal parts of
the present time of which the present time is made up [&hellip;] They
do not, however, exist, but only the present time exists, which is
made up of things that do not exist, namely the past and the future.
If someone then says: &ldquo;If the principal part does not exist,
neither does the whole&rdquo;, this is to be understood as applying to
those wholes which exist in virtue of the permanence of their parts,
and not to those which exist through the succession of their parts, as
do time, speech and an act of running. (C17, fol. 84vb; cited in
Ebbesen 1992: 72)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alberic thus wants to distinguish between two radically different
types of wholes: those whose parts exist all together and those whose
parts exist one after the other (the distinction was an important one
in later medieval physics and metaphysics; see, e.g., Trifogli 2000:
205&ndash;19; Pasnau 2011: 374&ndash;98; for the distinction in the
twelfth century, see Wci&oacute;rka forthcoming). Given their nature,
the latter type of wholes&mdash;one of Alberic&rsquo;s followers calls
them successive wholes&mdash;do not obey the standard rules for
integral wholes, and so one cannot argue from the non-existence of a
given part to the non-existence of the whole. The present day exists
as long as <em>some</em> part of it exists (Hansen forthcoming). As
the quoted passage shows, moreover, time is far from the only entity
of this type; processes and motions are also included. As we shall see
below, Abelard&rsquo;s rejection of such entities was one that the
Albricani would use against him in other contexts.</p>

<h2 id="LangMind">3. Language and Mind</h2>

<p>
Alberic developed striking and distinctive views on the relationship
between thought and spoken language, largely in the course of
interpreting Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Peri Hermeneias</em>. Because many
of these views criticize Abelard&rsquo;s doctrines, it will be useful
to present some Abelardian positions <em lang="fr">en passant</em>.
For a more general overview of Abelard&rsquo;s thought, readers are
encouraged to consult King and Arlig (2018 [2023]), Marenbon (1997,
2013a), and the studies in Brower and Guilfoy (eds, 2004).</p>

<h3 id="NoThouComp">3.1 No Thought is Composite</h3>

<p>
It is controversial whether Abelard has a theory of mental language,
akin to that of later thinkers like Ockham (King 2007; Panaccio 2010).
But in any case, Abelard is often happy to treat the structure of
language as a guide to the structure of thought. Now when we speak a
sentence&mdash;say, &ldquo;Socrates is a human&rdquo;&mdash;we first
speak the subject term (&ldquo;Socrates&rdquo;), before moving on to
the predicate (&ldquo;human&rdquo;). It is likewise, says Abelard, in
thought: we first direct our attention (<em lang="la">attendere</em>)
to Socrates, then to his humanity, and so on. As in speech, this
process of thinking takes time, and its output&mdash;a
thought&mdash;is a composite item with multiple proper parts. (<em lang="la">Tractatus
de intellectibus</em>, &sect;32; see also
Rosier-Catach 2004; 2017 for an analysis of attending in Abelard).</p>

<p>
Why does Abelard make these claims? In short, they are key to the
distinction he wants to make between words (<em lang="la">dictiones</em>),
and the complex phrases (<em lang="la">orationes</em>)
of which sentences are a species. We might
be inclined to think of words as somehow simple, and sentences on the
other hand as complex. But, as Abelard notices, this cannot be merely
a function of their meaning: by even a simple noun like
&ldquo;human&rdquo; we understand many things: rationality, animality,
and so forth (<em lang="la">Tractatus de intellectibus</em>,
&sect;32). Is the thought that corresponds to the word
&ldquo;human&rdquo; therefore a complex thought, just like the thought
that corresponds to a spoken sentence? No, says Abelard: by
&ldquo;human&rdquo; we understand many things, but all at the same
time. In contrast, by a sentence like &ldquo;A human is a rational
animal&rdquo;, we understand the meanings of the individual words in a
successive way, across time. Thus, the difference between words and
sentences depends on the way the two are composed in relation to time.
Abelard sums this up by drawing an analogy with sight: &ldquo;now I
see the three stones placed before me all at once, with one glance;
now I see them one after another successively, with multiple acts of
looking&rdquo; (<em lang="la">Tractatus de intellectibus</em>,
&sect;34). These successive acts of looking are analogous to
successive acts of attending in the composition of a complex
thought.</p>

<p>
Against this doctrine, the Albricani mount an impressive,
multi-pronged attack. Their arguments are preserved in H15 (I,
&sect;&sect;106&ndash;111) and H17 (fols 89vb&ndash;90ra). The former
text is edited but not translated, the latter is neither edited in
full nor translated. Translations of the relevant sections of H15, as
well as an edition and translation of the arguments in H17 are,
however, to be found in Schuman (2024).</p>

<p>
Of all these arguments, arguably the most elegant and clever is the
one that catches Abelard in the trap of his own strict presentism.
Recall that for Abelard, only the present moment exists (&sect;2.3,
above): the future is nothing (yet), and the past is nothing
(anymore). Abelard inferred from this that there are no such things as
successive wholes. But, as the Albricani point out, it then also
follows that there is no such thing as thoughts&mdash;at least, not
the thoughts that correspond to spoken sentences. After all, Abelard
characterizes these as having their parts across time, like the
separate acts of looking at a series of stones. Therefore, complex
thoughts do not&mdash;cannot&mdash;exist.</p>

<p>
Alberic&rsquo;s claim, against Abelard, that no thoughts are
composite, is briefly discussed by Rosier-Catach (2004), and has
received stand-alone treatment by Lenz (2007) and Schuman (2024).
Rosier-Catach is particularly concerned with the response to this
argument in Abelard (<em lang="la">Dialectica</em>, 68.25&ndash;34).
Following an analysis of th stance of H15, Lenz points out that it
would appear from these arguments that the Albricani rejected at least
a version of compositionality&mdash;that is, the view that the meaning
of sentences and thoughts is just a function of their meaningful
parts, and the way in which these parts are composed. Schuman observes
that the arguments advanced by the Albricani pose problems for
current, post-Fregean thought about the structure of thought in
relation to spoken language. More broadly, the question whether
compositionality entails complexity has been recently raised in
current philosophy of language by Keller (2022), who quite
persuasively argues that it does not. Whether the Albricani endorsed a
similar position, or even recognized these implications of their view,
is not currently known.</p>

<h3 id="MeanSpokLang">3.2 Meaning and Spoken Language</h3>

<p>
In the <em>Peri Hermeneias</em>, Aristotle explicitly sets aside the
grammatical moods other than the declarative. Questions, commands,
optatives and so forth are not of interest in logic, he says, because
they are neither true nor false (1.17a3&ndash;6). Even so,
twelfth-century commentators were left to deal with two complications
to this picture. First, though spoken phrases like commands and
requests are not signs of something true or false, Aristotle does say
they are significative (1.17a1). The question then is, significative
of what? Second, even though Aristotle is content to set these
non-assertive phrases aside, Boethius goes ahead and provides a
taxonomy of them anyway, in his longer commentary on the <em>Peri
hermeneias</em>. In addition to assertions (&ldquo;Socrates is
running&rdquo;), Boethius recognizes four: requests, questions,
commands, and vocatives. Respectively:</p>

<ul>

<li>If only Socrates would run</li>

<li>Is Socrates running?</li>

<li>Run, Socrates!</li>

<li>Hey there, Socrates, O runner thou!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Twelfth-century commentators are thus left to figure out how all these
are related.</p>

<p>
Abelard&rsquo;s answer is simple: they are all signs of the same
thing, namely, the thought (<em lang="la">intellectus</em>) of
Socrates running. (In this regard, Abelard&rsquo;s view looks a good
deal like the familiar Fregean picture). The Albricani push back: how
can they all be signs of the same thing, if only the assertion is
true? Abelard&rsquo;s famous development, which is supposed to head
off this problem, is that they differ in what they express, i.e.,
their <em lang="la">dicta</em>. What these <em lang="la">dicta</em>
are is controversial (see Cesalli 2012 and 2019, King &amp; Arlig 2018
[2022]). But in any case, it is critical for Alberic that only the
assertion (&ldquo;Socrates is running&rdquo;) expresses a thought; the
others are signs of passions of the soul (<em>passiones animae</em>).
Because passion of the soul is the genus of thought, every thought is
a passion of the soul; but not every passion of the soul is a thought.
Hence the foregoing examples differ from the corresponding assertion
on the level not only of language but also of mind.</p>

<p>
What evidence is there for this difference in mind? H15, an anonymous
text associated with Alberic&rsquo;s school, presents the argument of
a child demanding bread (I, &sect;51). A young boy shouts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Give me bread!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the boy, says the author of H15, lacks the reflective awareness of
his own will that would underwrite the corresponding assertion,
namely:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I want to have bread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Granted, an adult who hears the boy can form the corresponding
assertion (&ldquo;He wants to have bread&rdquo;); but this thought is
what is produced (<em lang="la">constituere</em>) in the adult by the
boy&rsquo;s command, not something signified in the mind of the boy
himself. Similarly, a dog&rsquo;s bark is not a noun, because it does
not signify the appropriate mental item&mdash;even if someone who
hears the dog can be made aware of the dog&rsquo;s anger, excitement,
etc. It is thus a defining feature of the Albricani that they sharply
distinguish semantics from pragmatics in this way: not every thought
that is produced in a listener corresponds to the same thought in the
mind of the speaker.</p>

<h2 id="Logi">4. Logic</h2>

<h3 id="EmbaAbel">4.1 Embarrassing Abelard</h3>

<p>
Alberic&rsquo;s most famous and significant logical finding is that
Abelard&rsquo;s logic is inconsistent. To see how his proof works,
first consider the following argument from opposites, which we will
call Embarrassing Argument 1 (EA1, following the terminology and
reconstruction of Martin 1987b):</p>

<blockquote aria-label="Embarrassing Argument 1" id="EA1">

<p>
If Socrates is a man and a stone, Socrates is a man</p>

<p>
If Socrates is a man, Socrates is not a stone</p>

<p>
&there4; If Socrates is a man and a stone, Socrates is not a stone</p>

<p>
But If Socrates is not a stone, Socrates is not a man and a stone</p>

<p>
&there4; If Socrates is a man and a stone, Socrates is not a man and a
stone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Alberic points out, Abelard&rsquo;s treatment of conditionals, plus
his account of the locus from opposites, bind him to accept this
argument, or some equally embarrassing version of it.
(<em>Introductiones Montane Minores</em>, 63&ndash;64; Martin 1987b:
391; for other formulations of such embarrassing arguments, see Martin
1987a: 432; Martin 2004: 188&ndash;89; Donato 2025: 366&ndash;73). Yet
although the premises of EA1 are true, the final conclusion is, on
Abelard&rsquo;s own lights, self-contradictory (more on this and
Abelard&rsquo;s commitments below).</p>

<p>
In response to this embarrassing argument, Abelard distinguishes a
broader and a narrower sense in which a conditional can be true (<em lang="la">Dialectica</em>,
283&ndash;84). In the broader sense, the
antecedent of a true conditional cannot be true without the consequent
also being true&mdash;roughly like modern Strict Implication. This
sense, Abelard thinks, is too broad. But in the narrower sense, the
antecedent of a conditional must also of itself require (<em lang="la">ex
se exigere</em>) the truth of the consequent. Hence to
give an example, any conditional that goes from a contingent truth
(&ldquo;it&rsquo;s raining in Leuven&rdquo;) to a necessary one <span class="nobr">(&ldquo;\(2+2=4\)&rdquo;)</span>
will be true in the
broad sense, but not true in the narrow sense, because the antecedent
does not require the truth of the consequent.</p>

<p>
This is often glossed in the secondary literature as a notion of
<em>containment</em>, and Abelard clearly thinks of it in this way.
Note, however, that Abelard thinks of this containment more in
metaphysical than semantic terms. Although being a human excludes the
possibility of being a stone, nevertheless not-being-a-stone is not
contained in being a human&mdash;that is to say, not-being-a-stone is
not contained in a human <em>qua</em> substance. In contrast, Abelard
tells us, &ldquo;If Socrates is a human, then Socrates is an
animal&rdquo; is admissible in the narrower sense, because animal is
contained in the human Socrates <em>qua</em> his substance.</p>

<p>
With this, Abelard has expressed the guiding idea of relevance logic,
past and present. He immediately puts it to work, ruling out each of
the premises of EA1 as false, since being a stone does not of itself
require not being a human, etc. In other words, if you ask me to
define what stone is, I do not include the negative requirement
&ldquo;not being a human&rdquo; in my (sufficient and correct)
definition. So, the premises of
 <a href="#EA1">EA1</a>
 are straightforwardly false conditionals. Therefore, the whole
argument does not lead from true premises to a false conclusion.
Having presented his solution, Abelard triumphantly declares that the
sort of necessity he has identified is free from all embarrassment
(&ldquo;<em lang="la">ab omni absoluta est inconvenienti</em>&rdquo;;
<em lang="la">Dialectica</em>, 284).</p>

<p>
But it was not to be so. Alberic&rsquo;s next move against Abelard was
decisive, and made use of precisely Abelard&rsquo;s own example of a
true conditional to construct another <em lang="la">reductio</em> out
of Abelardian conditionals&mdash;conditionals, that is, that meet the
containment requirement, because they use definitional terms. Thus
Abelard&rsquo;s stronger conditions with their appeal to a notion of
relevance was not sufficient to stave off disaster.</p>

<p>
The argument in question appears in various forms in the primary
literature: it is in the <em>Introductiones Montane Minores</em>
(65&ndash;66), and an anonymous commentary on Boethius&rsquo;s <em>On
the Hypothetical Syllogism</em> (SH1, fol. 79vb; cited in De Rijk
1966: 52&ndash;56; for the alpha-numerical label, see Iwakuma 2024: 20
n. 2). Among the primary sources, the most elegant presentation is in
the latter. Here it is (call it EA2), along with its formal
reconstruction of Martin (1987b: 394&ndash;395; see also Martin 1987a:
433):</p>

<p>
Having presented this argument, the anonymous author of the
<em>Introductiones Montanae Minores</em> reports&mdash;not without
apparent glee&mdash;that Abelard was compelled to grant its necessity.
It was a decisive win for Alberic and his school.</p>

<p>
Now to a modern reader, the putative absurdity of
 <a href="#EA1">EA1</a>
 and
 <a href="#EA2">EA2</a>
 may not be so clear: after all, the antecedent of line 5 is false,
and so the conditional should be true&mdash;at least as a material
conditional. But for Abelard, it is not a material conditional, as we
have seen, but rather has the stronger relevantist conditions just
discussed. What&rsquo;s more, Abelard inherited from
Boethius&mdash;and endorsed&mdash;what is now sometimes called
Boethius&rsquo;s Theorem (for more on this, see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-connexive/">connexive logic</a>).
 By this theorem, no proposition can entail its opposite. For Abelard,
this means that no conditional of the form \(p \to \neg p\) can be
true (Martin 1987b). And, if we return to the concluding lines of EA1
and EA2, we can see that they do take this form. (Supposing, that is,
that the negation in the apodosis of EA1 ranges over the conjunctive
sign). Thus it is Abelard&rsquo;s specific logical commitments that
render him vulnerable to Alberic&rsquo;s argument. And it seems that
Abelard threw his hands up at this problem, as one that cut to the
heart of his own system.</p>

<p>
More broadly,
 <a href="#EA2">EA2</a>
 marked&mdash;to use the phrase of Calvin Normore&mdash;&ldquo;a
watershed in the history of logic&rdquo; (1987: 205). The general
crisis it provoked led to a highly fruitful pursuit of various
solutions in the schools. For the Albricani, EA2 is not a problem
because of their realism about predication. Thus, for them, the second
conjunct in the antecedent of 2 (&ldquo;Socrates is not an
animal&rdquo;) is destructive of the whole conditional, since Socrates
is indeed a human, and necessarily so; thus the conditional is false
(more on this below). At least one other school besides the
Albricani&mdash;the Porretani&mdash;seems to have adopted a similar
approach. In contrast, the Parvipontani responded by embracing what
are now sometimes called the paradoxes of strict implication: anything
follows from what&rsquo;s impossible, and what&rsquo;s necessary
follows from anything. Of course, the Nominalists could not provide a
solution like that of the Albricani, given their anti-realist
ontological commitments. And the commitment of the Nominalists to
containment meant they could not adopt the solution of the
Parvipontani.</p>

<p>
Indeed, whereas Alberic&rsquo;s Embarrassing Arguments were a coup for
him in his day, it was the Parvipontani&mdash;or anyway, their
approach&mdash;that was ultimately to prevail in the following
centuries, culminating in the purely treatment of logical consequence
in Buridan&rsquo;s <em lang="la">Tractatus de Consequentiis</em>
(1.3&ndash;4). In Buridan&rsquo;s account, consequence is purely
truth-functional, not a matter of relevance or containment. And it was
perhaps owing to Alberic&rsquo;s influence that, leading up to
Buridan, the so-called Parisian tradition of thinking about logical
consequence emphasized truth preservation in this way. In contrast,
what is sometimes called the British tradition, removed from the
crisis, stressed relevantist versions of containment. (See the entry,
 <a href="../consequence-medieval/">medieval theories of consequence</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Many of these historical developments have received considerable
attention in the secondary literature in addition to the works cited
above. Wilks (2008) shows how Alberic treats the problem of EA2 as a
problem of predication and not&mdash;as Abelard had
done&mdash;conditional inference (more on this in
 <a href="#Logi">&sect;4.1</a>,
 below); Wilks also analyses in detail how other schools responded to
this argument (2008: 142ff.). Lenzen (2021: 119&ndash;26) analyzes a
more complex version of EA1, and Abelard&rsquo;s response to it. And
in addition to historical studies, logic with a more contemporary
focus has taken an interest in Alberic&rsquo;s EA2 as well; in
particular, Estrada-Gonz&aacute;lez and Ram&iacute;rez-C&aacute;mara
(2020) suggest a &ldquo;Nelsonian escape&rdquo; from Alberic&rsquo;s
argument by rejecting Simplification as a straightforward deductive
rule, which would rule out premise 2 of EA2. The authors grant,
however, that this move apparently comes at a &ldquo;higher
theoretical cost&rdquo; than simply rejecting Abelard&rsquo;s logic
for conditionals (2020: 111).</p>

<h3 id="AlbeOwnLogi">4.2 Alberic&rsquo;s Own Logic</h3>

<p>
In addition to his arguments against Abelard, Alberic also expounded
and developed several positive logical doctrines. As we mentioned
(&sect;1 above), it&rsquo;s known that the Albricani kept a list of
characteristic logico-philosophical positions. This list has been
edited and discussed by Iwakuma (2013) and is translated in Hansen,
Donato, and Schuman (forthcoming a). The main analysis in the
secondary literature of Alberic&rsquo;s overall doctrine, however, is
Donato (2025). Donato argues that Alberic&rsquo;s logic is (i)
realist, in the sense that it deals with relations among things (<em lang="la">res</em>)
rather than relations among linguistic items, and
(ii) that it is an attempt to resuscitate a characteristically
Boethian logic, in response to the heterodox views propounded by
Abelard. To see all this in action, let&rsquo;s return to
Alberic&rsquo;s account of predication, before looking at his logic of
conditionals.</p>

<p>
When we predicate <em>P</em> of <em>S</em>&mdash;for instance, by
saying &ldquo;<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>&rdquo;&mdash;what are we
talking about? According to Alberic&rsquo;s Nominalist rivals, we are
predicating the word &ldquo;<em>P</em>&rdquo; of the word
&ldquo;<em>S</em>&rdquo;. But as we saw above (&sect;2.1), although
Alberic allows that predication is in some sense linguistic, he adds
another and primary layer, what the Albricani call
&ldquo;thing-predication&rdquo; (<em lang="la">praedicatio
rerum</em>): thing <em>P</em> is predicated of thing <em>S</em>. Thus
logic, in the final analysis, is about things.</p>

<p>
Alberic recognized several key implications of this view, two of which
are: <em>P</em> is only properly speaking predicated of <em>S</em>
when the predication is</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="pred1">true (a thing cannot be predicated of another thing if
it is not so in reality); and</li>

<li id="pred2">affirmative (&ldquo;No human is a stone&rdquo; does not
express any kind of inherence in things in the actual world).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Regarding
 <a href="#pred1">(i)</a>,
 Alberic holds that a false putative predications are merely clusters
of terms (<em lang="la">appositiones terminorum</em>). In
Donato&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;they fail to express any nexus of
predication&rdquo;. Similarly, regarding
 <a href="#pred2">(ii)</a>:
 negative statements do not express the predication of one thing of
another, but rather the <em>removal</em> of it.</p>

<p>
Importantly for his logic, Alberic&rsquo;s requirements (i) and (ii)
allow him to account for what is wrong with EA2, and so to avoid the
trap he set for Abelard. For there is not an appropriate relation of
predication in the second conjunct of premise 2 of EA2, since
&ldquo;&hellip;is not a human&rdquo; cannot be predicated of Socrates.
This is because there is an incompatibility or opposition (<em lang="la">repugnantia</em>)
between Socrates and not-being-a-human.
(Likewise, also, for EA1, since being-a-human and being-a-stone are
incompatible). Since this relation is lacking in the things
themselves, there cannot be a conditional relation, either.</p>

<p>
For further analysis of this relationship between predication and
conditionals in Alberic, his arguments for thinking logic primarily
deals with things (<em lang="la">res</em>), and his qualification of
the logical law of transitivity, see Donato (2025).</p>

<h2 id="FutuContDiviFore">5. Future Contingents and Divine Foreknowledge</h2>

<p>
The future is contingent: maybe there will be a sea battle tomorrow,
maybe there won&rsquo;t. But as Aristotle claims in an influential
passage (<em>Peri Hermeneias</em> 9, 19a23&ndash;19a39), it is at
present neither true nor false that it will.</p>

<p>
On its own, the contingency of the future introduces plenty of
complications. But it gets worse when we consider God&rsquo;s
omniscience. If God knows the future, it must turn out the way He
knows, and therefore it cannot be contingent. If it is truly
contingent, then it falls outside divine knowledge, and so poses a
counterexample to divine omniscience. These problems were set out and
discussed by Boethius in another highly influential passage, <em>On
the Consolation of Philosophy</em> 5.3&ndash;6.</p>

<p>
Alberic&rsquo;s solution is clear and direct: God&rsquo;s knowledge
undergoes change. That is, as things unfold, so also does God&rsquo;s
knowledge of them. But defending this solution involves key
difficulties: it falls to Alberic and his school to show that such
changes in knowledge do not entail a change in God. This is something
they largely handle in quantitative terms: just because God knows
different things today than He did yesterday, it does not follow that
He knows more or less. We know of two ways that these claims were
defended in Alberic&rsquo;s school.</p>

<p>
The first way is apparently to say that God knows all things, but that
when something changes, the new knowledge gets swapped out with the
old in an apparently instantaneous way. So, for example, God knows
that you are sitting; when you stand up, the knowledge that you are
sitting is straightaway swapped out with the knowledge that you are
standing. God&rsquo;s knowledge is, presumably, being constantly
updated in this way. But from this, it does not follow that God is
gaining or losing knowledge, at least in terms of overall quantity. As
the author of H17 (fol. 95rb; see the analysis in Schuman forthcoming)
puts it, just because Socrates has different coins in his pocket today
from the ones he had yesterday, it does not follow that he must have
more or fewer coins overall. (Indeed, Socrates could even increase his
wealth without increasing his total number of coins, for instance
trading a dozen silver coins for a dozen gold ones). But again, in
order to work the way the author wants it to, the substitutions in
either case&mdash;coins or knowledge&mdash;must be simultaneous.</p>

<p>
The second way is a good deal more sophisticated: God&rsquo;s
knowledge is infinite. It follows that any additions to it do not
change the overall quantity, since what is infinite cannot be
increased or reduced by addition or subtraction. This is the position
of H10 (fols 174ra&ndash;va): new items are constantly added to
God&rsquo;s infinite knowledge, but this is not enough to change how
much knowledge God has at any given time.</p>

<p>
As Schuman (forthcoming) points out, this account bears an interesting
likeness to the much later example in Hilbert (1924/1925 [2013]).
Imagine, says Hilbert, a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, each
containing one guest. If someone new were to arrive at the hotel,
finding a place for the newcomer would be as simple as asking everyone
to move one door down. So guest 1 would move to room 2, guest 2 to
room 3, and so on <em lang="la">ad infinitum</em>. And just like that,
we free up room 1. Similarly, the arrival of new knowledge does
nothing to alter the quantity of God&rsquo;s (infinite) knowledge. As
set out in H10, it is an interesting moment in the historical
development of thought about infinities.</p>

<p>
In any case, for the Albricani these changes in divine knowledge do
not produce a change in God. If there is any change at all, it is
something like a mere Cambridge change of the sort first discussed by
Geach (1969: 71&ndash;72). Here is an example of a mere Cambridge
change, due to Parfit (1984: 494): suppose that, while shaving, I cut
myself. This produces a Cambridge change&mdash;but a merely Cambridge
change&mdash;in Confucius (Kongzi; 551&ndash;479 BC). This is because
it changes the things that can be truly said of Confucius: that he
lived on a planet in which one more person has cut a cheek while
shaving. If changing knowledge produces any kind of change in God, for
the Albricani it must be something like that.</p>

<p>
It is noteworthy that this doctrine is one of the most
discussed&mdash;if not the most discussed&mdash;of Alberic&rsquo;s
positions, just in terms of text alone. The relevant texts in H10 and
H17 have been edited, translated, and analyzed by Schuman
(forthcoming). It is also noteworthy that the view that God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge can undergo change comes up later in the fourteenth
century, in a debate between Robert Holcot (ca. 1290&ndash;1349) and
William Ockham (ca. 1287&ndash;1347). Holcot holds a position quite
similar to the Albricani (see the discussion of Holcot in Nuchelmans
1973; and Brower-Toland 2013). This need not mean that Holcot had read
Alberic; indeed, it seems unlikely that he did. In any case, the scope
of Alberic&rsquo;s influence in later centuries&mdash;if indeed there
was such influence&mdash;is not currently known.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Given that contemporary study of Alberic&rsquo;s philosophy is still
in its infancy, there are a number of questions which call not only
for answers but also for proper contextualization&mdash;questions we
have undertaken to highlight in the foregoing exposition. A systematic
attempt to address any one of these would constitute a stand-alone
contribution in its own right, worthy of publication.</p>
