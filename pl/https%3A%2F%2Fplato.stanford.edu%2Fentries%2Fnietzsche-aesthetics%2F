<h1>Nietzsche&rsquo;s Aesthetics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Feb 14, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Nietzsche&rsquo;s first book was entitled <em>The Birth of Tragedy out
of the Spirit of Music</em> (1872), and one of his very last works was
called <em>The Case of Wagner: A Musician&rsquo;s Problem</em> (1888).
As this simple fact indicates, reflection on art (and especially, on
music and drama) is an abiding and central feature of
Nietzsche&rsquo;s thought. Indeed, very nearly all of his works
address aesthetic questions at least in passing. Some of these
questions are familiar from the philosophical tradition: e.g., how
should we explain the effect tragedy has on us? What is the relation
of aesthetic value to other kinds of value? Is aesthetic appreciation
disinterested and autonomous? What is the appropriate way to respond
to Plato&rsquo;s notorious condemnation of &ldquo;imitative&rdquo;
art? Other questions are less familiar (though, also not entirely
without precedent): e.g., what do artistic products say about the
&ldquo;health&rdquo; or &ldquo;sickness&rdquo; of the culture or
person who produces or values them? Can one make a work of art out of
oneself and one&rsquo;s life? Still other questions, which garner a
good deal of attention from aestheticians today, do not interest
Nietzsche much or at all: e.g., are estimations of aesthetic value
objective or merely subjective? What distinguishes works of art from
objects that aren&rsquo;t works of art? Is reliance on testimony
acceptable in judging the aesthetic merit of a work? On these and
similar questions, Nietzsche has little to say.</p>

<p>
This entry will be concerned with Nietzsche&rsquo;s contributions to
aesthetics, construed somewhat narrowly as the philosophical
discipline dealing with questions about art and aesthetic value. It
will largely bracket Nietzsche&rsquo;s views on the application of
aesthetic concepts and norms to life as they surface, e.g., in his
account of self-styling or self-creation. While this topic is of
immense importance, it has been dealt with in considerable detail
elsewhere (see the entry on
 <a href="../nietzsche/">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>,
 &sect;4). The entry is generally organized thematically, rather than
chronologically. But, it will begin with two sections focusing on
Nietzsche&rsquo;s first book, <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, since
this work is both his most sustained and systematic treatment of
aesthetic questions, and because it sets the stage for the rest of his
aesthetic thought. Subsequent sections will deal with some of the
themes that surface first in <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> but
continue to be of central importance throughout Nietzsche&rsquo;s
philosophical career.</p>

<h2 id="EarInfNieAes">1. Early Influences on Nietzsche&rsquo;s Aesthetics</h2>

<p>
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> was first published in 1872, when
Nietzsche was a professor of classical philology at the University of
Basel. At the time, it was a work of striking originality in both
philosophical aesthetics and classical scholarship (although it was
not enthusiastically received in either field). Original though it may
be in many regards, <em>The Birth</em> was also written under a wide
array of influences. Any discussion of Nietzsche&rsquo;s debut work,
and by extension any consideration of his aesthetic thought as a
whole, must begin with at least a brief discussion of these
influences. What follows is a cursory treatment of three of the most
important: Arthur Schopenhauer (1788&ndash;1860), Richard Wagner
(1813&ndash;1883), and Friedrich Schiller (1759&ndash;1805). This
examination will provide important context for understanding
Nietzsche&rsquo;s programme in aesthetics.</p>

<h3 id="ArtSch">1.1 Arthur Schopenhauer</h3>

<p>
The best-known philosophical influence on the early Nietzsche is
Arthur Schopenhauer, whom Nietzsche first read in 1865.
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics all had a
profound effect on the young philologist. This metaphysics sets out
from an acceptance of Kant&rsquo;s distinction between appearances (or
the &lsquo;World as Representation,&rsquo; as Schopenhauer styles it)
and things-in-themselves. Unlike Kant, however, Schopenhauer offers a
positive account of the nature of noumenal reality. The account holds
that the inner essence of the world is a single, timeless,
quasi-volitional &ldquo;striving,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Will.&rdquo;
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s basic metaphysical position thus consists of two
main theses:</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Transcendental Idealism:</em> Space and time are subjective
properties of the mind, and not properties of the world as it is
in-itself.</p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Will-Monism:</em> Reality in-itself is a single being that is
characterized essentially by quasi-dynamic or conative properties
(termed &lsquo;Will&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
Will-Monism, together with a broadly Epicurean theory maintaining that
willing is a source of ceaseless suffering, underwrites a key
descriptive claim of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s philosophy: human life
necessarily involves more suffering than pleasure or happiness. From
this descriptive claim, Schopenhauer infers his major normative
thesis, the doctrine of philosophical pessimism: life is not worth
living, or, the world&rsquo;s non-existence would be preferable to its
existence (for an excellent in-depth treatment of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
arguments for pessimism, see Simmons 2024). Inspired by (certain
versions of) Christianity and Buddhism, Schopenhauer holds the
appropriate response to this pessimistic truth to be &ldquo;denial of
the will to life,&rdquo; understood as the ascetic repudiation of
desire. Schopenhauer&rsquo;s aesthetics is best understood against the
backdrop of this pessimistic ethics and its attendant metaphysics.</p>

<p>
For our purposes, the most important claim of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
aesthetics is that the pleasure we take in art (and beauty more
generally) is a disinterested one. When confronted with a beautiful
object, Schopenhauer thinks, our consciousness becomes possessed, so
to speak, by its purely objective properties, focusing simply on
<em>what</em> the object itself is (or the &ldquo;Platonic idea&rdquo;
it expresses) rather than on its relations to other objects. This
means, amongst other things, that aesthetic appreciation ignores the
relations the object has to our will, i.e. how it conduces to or
impedes the satisfaction of our subjective interests. Schopenhauer
puts a peculiar twist on this relatively common modern conception of
aesthetic appreciation by conceiving of such enjoyment as a
<em>silencing</em> of the will. Since willing, for Schopenhauer, is
a&mdash;indeed <em>the</em>&mdash;source of suffering, aesthetic
pleasure constitutes a relief from the burden of our existence.
Aesthetic experience, then, resembles and, so to speak, presages
salvation from the world and its ills, which is to be attained through
asceticism (see, e.g., Shapshay 2024). Though such will-lessness is a
feature of all aesthetic appreciation, the negation of the will is
overtly thematized in <em>tragedy</em>, and Schopenhauer accordingly
reserves particularly high praise for this artform. Tragedy makes
&ldquo;palpable the futility of human striving and the nothingness of
this whole existence in a great and striking example, thus revealing
the deepest meaning of life; this is why tragedy is acknowledged to be
the most sublime form of literature&rdquo; (<em>SW</em>
3:730&ndash;31/<em>WWR</em> 2:651). It is Schopenhauer&rsquo;s own
pessimistic philosophy, then, which constitutes the ultimate content
of the tragic genre.</p>

<p>
The early Nietzsche took much from Schopenhauer. <em>The Birth of
Tragedy</em> appears to operate under the assumption that
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s descriptive claim about suffering is true.
Nietzsche also officially endorses Schopenhauer&rsquo;s basic picture
of aesthetic enjoyment as essentially will-less (see, e.g., <em>BT</em>
5). Schopenhauer&rsquo;s metaphysical distinction between
representation and will is also evidently taken on board, as is his
theory of music, according to which music, unlike the other arts, is a
direct &ldquo;copy&rdquo; the noumenal will. Matters may not be quite
this straightforward, however. Some scholars have noted divergences
between <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s and Schopenhauer&rsquo;s respective
theories of music (Janaway 1998; Vandenabeele 2003). And the question
of whether <em>The Birth</em> accepts Schopenhauer&rsquo;s metaphysics
has been a subject of considerable dispute in recent years (see
&sect;2.2 below). Whatever should be said about <em>The Birth</em>,
Nietzsche&rsquo;s later aesthetics is clearly set up in opposition to
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s. In works such as <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>
(1886), <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887), and <em>Twilight
of the Idols</em> (1888), Nietzsche rejects Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
conception of disinterested aesthetic appreciation, as well as his
more general attempt to connect aesthetic experience to the ethics of
pessimism. Schopenhauer remains an important foil against which
Nietzsche formulates his own aesthetic position and, precisely for
this reason, his influence is never entirely absent.</p>

<h3 id="RicWagGerRom">1.2 Richard Wagner and German Romanticism</h3>

<p>
While Schopenhauer&rsquo;s influence on the early Nietzsche was
crucial, it would be misleading to suggest that it was entirely
overriding. Of perhaps equal importance was the influence of the
composer and librettist Richard Wagner (1813&ndash;1883). Nietzsche
knew and was on friendly, even intimate, terms with Wagner during the
planning and construction of the <em>Festspielhaus</em> in Bayreuth.
During this period (roughly 1869&ndash;1876), Nietzsche was profoundly
impressed not only with Wagner&rsquo;s artistic achievements and
plans, but also with Wagner&rsquo;s attempts to develop a theoretical
framework for his artistic project. By the time the two had become
acquainted, Wagner was himself a convert to Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
philosophy, and was especially taken with Schopenhauer&rsquo;s theory
of music (Wagner would expound a somewhat idiosyncratic version of
this theory in <em>Beethoven</em> [1870]). Yet, Wagner&rsquo;s
aesthetic thought&mdash;contained in a voluminous corpus of difficult
theoretical writings produced over the course of four
decades&mdash;was quite protean, and owes at least as much to the
older tradition of German Romanticism as it does to Schopenhauer. Two
elements of Wagner&rsquo;s philosophy are worth emphasizing here: his
conception of the &ldquo;total work of art&rdquo;, and his vision of a
&ldquo;new mythology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
With ancient Greek drama as his model, Wagner advocated, and hoped
himself to (re)create, &ldquo;total,&rdquo; &ldquo;complete,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;collected&rdquo; works of art (<em>Gesamtkunstwerke</em>).
Greek drama, and Wagner&rsquo;s own <em>Musikdrama</em>, are supposed
to be &ldquo;collected&rdquo; in the sense that they constitute a
synthesis of distinct artforms&mdash;music, poetry, mime, dance, etc.
(see 1850, 186&ndash;87). Yet they are also &ldquo;collected&rdquo; in
another, more social sense: Greek dramas were, and Wagner&rsquo;s own
<em>Musikdramen</em> would be, religious festivals where the whole
community could gather and share in a common experience of profound
significance. Though present in the earlier Romantic tradition, the
idea that aesthetic experience should not be coolly critical, but
instead something almost sacramental, is an especially pronounced and
consistent theme in Wagner&rsquo;s prose writings. This thought had a
decisive influence on the early Nietzsche. One of his main aims in
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> is to take seriously the fact that Greek
tragedies were performed as part of <em>religious</em> festivals, and
thus to show that the modern tendency to view them as
&ldquo;mere&rdquo; literature is badly misguided.</p>

<p>
The need for an artform that can perform this sort of sacramental role
arises from what Wagner, sounding a common refrain of post-Kantian
thought, takes to be a chief malady of modernity. Modern culture has
become increasingly specialized, solipsistic, and crudely
materialistic. As a result, we find ourselves profoundly
alienated&mdash;from one another, from nature, even from ourselves.
Adding to the insult, art itself has become commodified and serves the
purpose of mere pleasant diversion, rather than answering to a
&ldquo;true need&rdquo; (1850, 12). One such need is the need for
&ldquo;unity,&rdquo; or, as Novalis famously put it, &ldquo;<em>the
drive to be at home everywhere</em>&rdquo; (<em>Werke</em>, 491).
Wagner believed that art could answer this need by serving as a vessel
for a new mythology. By the time he was writing, this was an
established theme in Romantic thought&mdash;one which was given
special prominence by the Schlegel brothers, Schelling, and others.
The idea was roughly that mythologies provide a synoptic worldview
which, unlike that of philosophy or the natural sciences, speaks
directly to the senses and the imagination. Because it does not
require any specialist knowledge to be understood, mythology is
uniquely capable of speaking to a community as a whole. As Wagner
expresses it, &ldquo;the work of art is the living presentation of
religion&ndash;&ndash;but religions are not invented by the artist,
they emerge only from the <em>folk</em> (<em>Volk</em>)&rdquo; (1850,
36).</p>

<p>
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>&rsquo;s debt to this Wagnerian vision is
unmistakable. But Nietzsche would soon become disillusioned, and by
the time of his last writings his attitude toward Wagner is
overwhelmingly, even irrationally hostile. Whether this means
Nietzsche jettisoned his early Wagnerian ideals, or whether he only
felt Wagner, the man and the artist, failed to live up to them, is
difficult to say (see Gemes 2022, 33). What is certain is that Wagner
and his art would remain central concerns of Nietzsche&rsquo;s for the
duration of his career&mdash;so much so that he would devote two full
books to criticizing Wagner in 1888 (<em>The Case of Wagner</em> and
<em>Nietzsche contra Wagner</em>).</p>

<p>
The influence of German Romanticism on the early Nietzsche came from
other quarters too. Of particular importance is A.W. Schlegel, whose
<em>Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature</em> (Schlegel
<em>VKL</em>) Nietzsche read carefully prior to writing <em>The Birth
of Tragedy</em> (see NF 1869: 1[85]&ndash;1[105]). Schlegel&rsquo;s
conception of the tragic chorus and his interpretation of Greek
mythology influenced Nietzsche&rsquo;s presentation in <em>The
Birth</em>, and many of Nietzsche&rsquo;s notorious broadsides against
Euripides are prefigured in the <em>Lectures</em> (though both are
likely drawing on an older critical tradition as well). Also of
importance was the poet Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin (1770&ndash;1843), a
favorite of Nietzsche&rsquo;s as a schoolboy and one possible source
for his famous distinction between the Apollonian and the Dionysian
(Young 2013, 96&ndash;98). Studies of Nietzsche&rsquo;s intellectual
and personal connections to Wagner include K&ouml;hler 1998; Young
2010, 105&ndash;34, 2014, 131&ndash;40; and Scruton 2014. For recent
treatments of Nietzsche and the wider romantic tradition, see
Williamson 2004, 234&ndash;84, Ameriks 2012, and Gemes 2023.</p>

<h3 id="FriSchGerCla">1.3 Friedrich Schiller and German Classicism</h3>

<p>
A third critical influence on Nietzsche&rsquo;s early aesthetics was
the German poet, dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich
Schiller. That Nietzsche felt an affinity with Schiller at this period
of his career is hardly surprising&mdash;Schiller was generally
recognized as a &ldquo;German Shakespeare&rdquo;, a consummate master
of the artform that most interested the young philology profressor;
Schiller&rsquo;s theoretical works were amongst the most important
sources of inspiration for the younger Romantic generation that had in
turn inspired Wagner&rsquo;s thought; and Schopenhauer and German
pessimists also often enlisted Schiller as a key predecessor (Beiser
2018). Above all, the period of artistic collaboration between
Schiller and Goethe, the extraordinary era of Weimar Classicism,
seemed to hint at the true creative potential of the &ldquo;German
spirit&rdquo;&mdash;potential which Nietzsche thought was being
squandered on staid academic specialism and crude, militaristic
nationalism.</p>

<p>
Like his successors in the Romantic tradition, Schiller thought that
the ancient world was characterized by a now-lost sense of unity and
harmony. This issue is thematized in his influential treatises <em>On
the Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters</em> (1795) and
<em>On Na&iuml;ve and Sentimental Poetry</em> (1795/6). In the latter,
Schiller distinguishes between two novel types of aesthetic response
to nature and art, the titular na&iuml;ve and sentimental. Cultures
like Homeric and Classical Greece typically produce works of
na&iuml;ve art. Such art expresses their easy oneness with themselves
and nature, a state in which the human being &ldquo;operates as an
undivided sensuous unity, as a harmonizing whole&rdquo; (NA 20:436).
Sentimental art, by contrast, expresses our longing for this bygone
time when &ldquo;we were happy and perfect&rdquo; (NA 20:427). In
other words, it presents such harmony, not as a fact, but as an
<em>ideal</em>, and is thus the art proper to the modern world, in
which the two sides of our nature&mdash;reason and feeling&mdash;have
been divided and set against one another. The distinction between
na&iuml;ve and sentimental seems not only to have been the inspiration
for the slightly later distinction between Classical and Romantic art
(see Eckermann 1837 [1981, 379&ndash;80]), but possibly also for
Nietzsche&rsquo;s Apollonian-Dionysian duality (Kalar 2008; cf.
<em>BT</em> 2&ndash;3; NF 1870: 7[126]). Crucially, however, Nietzsche
does not see the ancient world as purely &ldquo;na&iuml;ve.&rdquo; The
Greeks&rsquo; na&iuml;vet&eacute; was not a natural endowment, but an
achievement&mdash;a coping mechanism developed in response to a world
of unspeakable cruelty (see e.g. letter to Rohde 16 July, 1872 [SB
1872: 239]). Moreover, Nietzsche finds a degree of sentimentality
already characteristic of the Greek outlook, in particular of the
Dionysian mysteries (<em>BT</em> 2/KSA 1:33).</p>

<p>
Thus, while Nietzsche never accepted Schiller&rsquo;s conception of
the Greeks wholesale, that conception significantly influenced his
interpretation of the &ldquo;Apollonian&rdquo; element of Greek
culture. This influence is evident in other ways as well. In the
<em>Aesthetic Letters</em>, Schiller develops an influential notion of
&ldquo;beautiful semblance&rdquo; (<em>sch&ouml;ner</em>
<em>Schein</em>) (see esp. NA 20:398&ndash;405). Such semblances are
distinctive types of illusions produced by works of fine art: they are
paradigmatically non-deceptive and enjoyed for their own sake. The
phrase &lsquo;beautiful semblance&rsquo; plays on the double meaning
of the German word <em>Schein</em>, which can signify both
&ldquo;semblance,&rdquo; &ldquo;illusion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;appearance,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;gleam,&rdquo;
&ldquo;brilliance,&rdquo; &ldquo;radiance.&rdquo; Schiller&rsquo;s
point is that aesthetic appreciation involves taking joy in the mere
look of things without being concerned with what they are, though also
without confusing appearance and reality. We recognize, for example,
that the appearance of three-dimensionality on the flat surface of the
canvas is a mere illusion, and this is part of what we enjoy.
Nietzsche would make this sense of beautiful semblance central to his
account of both Apollonian art and culture in <em>The Birth of
Tragedy</em> (Stoll 2019).</p>

<p>
Between 1792 and 1803, Schiller also wrote extensively about tragedy.
His essay &ldquo;On the Use of the Chorus in Tragedy,&rdquo;
prefigures a central claim of <em>The Birth</em>&mdash;that the tragic
chorus is essential to the proper experience of tragedy. The chorus,
he argues, allows the spectators of a tragedy to adopt a
&ldquo;distanced&rdquo; perspective on the drama and to view it as an
idealized product of the poet&rsquo;s imagination rather than a crude
imitation of reality (see Stoll 2022 for further discussion of this
view). In both his lectures on Sophocles and in <em>The Birth of
Tragedy</em> itself, Nietzsche explicitly endorses Schiller&rsquo;s
account of the chorus (KGA II.3, 25&ndash;27; <em>BT</em> 7/KSA
1:54&ndash;55). Nor could he ignore Schiller&rsquo;s remark in a
letter to Goethe that &ldquo;I have always had a certain faith in the
opera&mdash;that tragedy would develop out of it into a nobler form,
just as it did from the choruses of the ancient Bacchic
festivals&rdquo; (NA 29:179; cf. NF 1871: 9[83]). Of Schiller&rsquo;s
account of tragic pleasure, however, he is more critical. In essays
such as &ldquo;On the Ground of the Enjoyment in Tragic Objects&rdquo;
and &ldquo;On the Sublime,&rdquo; Schiller argues that the pleasure we
take in tragedy is a form of the sublime. Tragic heroes, he suggests,
paradigmatically sacrifice their well-being or even their lives for
the sake of some higher principle (the Antigone of Sophocles&rsquo;
eponymous play is a good example). And this somehow makes the audience
aware of a similar power in themselves, which Schiller takes to be the
Kantian faculty of transcendental freedom. It is this awareness that
constitutes our pleasure in tragedy. Schiller&rsquo;s strategy is thus
to apply to tragedy Kant&rsquo;s notion of the &ldquo;dynamically
sublime,&rdquo; according to which a &ldquo;counter-purposive&rdquo;
object can give us a feeling of ennoblement by stimulating awareness
of the power of our moral faculties. In <em>The Birth</em>, Nietzsche
does suggest that tragic pleasure is a species of the sublime
(<em>BT</em> 7/KSA 1:57), though he explicitly refuses an explanation
in terms of &ldquo;the morally sublime&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 24; for
comment, see Raymond 2014).</p>

<p>
As with his attitude toward Schopenhauer and Wagner, Nietzsche&rsquo;s
feelings toward Schiller would sour in his later years. During these
years there is little explicit engagement with Schiller, and when his
name is mentioned, he is dismissed as a &ldquo;moral trumpeter&rdquo;
(<em>TI</em> &ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo; 1). However, a number of
scholars have made the case that elements of Schiller&rsquo;s thought,
and the broader German Classicist tradition to which it belongs,
continue to exercise considerable influence on Nietzsche beyond
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> (see Martin 1996; Bishop &amp;
Stephenson 2005; Katsafanas 2011; Stoll 2019; and Lichtenstein 2019).
Noteworthy is that Nietzsche&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of
artistic <em>Schein</em> would continue into his later works, as would
his positively valanced use the term &lsquo;na&iuml;ve&rsquo; in
reference to members of the ancient nobility (<em>GM</em> I.10/KSA
5:272, <em>GM</em> II.7/KSA 5:304).</p>

<h2 id="BirTra">2. <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em></h2>

<h3 id="ProBirTra">2.1 The Problem of <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em></h3>

<p>
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> is, in the first instance, an attempt to
offer a philosophical theory of the nature and value of tragedy, and
in this sense it belongs to a tradition stretching from
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Poetics</em> to Hegel&rsquo;s
<em>Aesthetics</em> lectures and beyond. Two questions have tended to
orient this tradition: (1) in what does the value of the experience of
tragedy consist (if indeed it is valuable at all)? (2) what explains
the pleasure we take in watching tragedies? (1) owes its urgency to
Plato&rsquo;s argument in <em>Republic</em> X that tragedy corrupts
its viewers. (2) is motivated by the familiar but paradoxical fact
that the pleasure we get from tragedy depends on emotional
responses&mdash;pity, fear, anxiety, and so forth&mdash;that are
intrinsically unpleasant. Predictably, <em>The Birth</em> does attempt
to answer both questions ((1) is a constant theme; for (2) see esp.
<em>BT</em> 22/KSA 1:141&ndash;44, <em>BT</em> 24/KSA 1:152&ndash;53).
But, surprisingly enough, neither is really its main animating
problem. Nietzsche&rsquo;s chief goal in the book is rather to suggest
that there is a profound existential problem facing humanity, and to
argue that tragedy (or, more specifically, Attic tragedy and its
supposed reincarnation in the Wagnerian <em>Musikdrama</em>) is the
<em>only</em> way of solving it. His answers to (1) and (2) then fall
out of this more general argument, rather than constituting his
philosophical starting point.</p>

<p>
What, then, is that problem? The natural suggestion is to locate it in
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism (e.g. Young 1992, 26&ndash;9; Young
2006, 14&ndash;15; Soll 1990, 1998; Came 2005). Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
pessimism combines the descriptive thesis that life necessarily
involves more suffering than happiness, with the normative thesis that
life is therefore not worth living, or that non-existence is
preferable to existence. That this is Nietzsche&rsquo;s main concern
is strongly suggested by his repeated references to the so-called
&ldquo;wisdom of Silenus&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 3/ KSA 1:35, <em>BT</em>
4/KSA 1:39&ndash;41, <em>BT</em> 7/KSA 1:57, <em>BT</em> 24/KSA
1:151). This &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;&mdash;which is reported in a
fragment of a lost dialogue of Aristotle&rsquo;s (see <em>F 44
R<sup>3</sup></em> [Aristotle <em>CW</em>, 2401&ndash;2]), and alluded
to in Sophocles (see <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em>, 1211)&mdash;is that
&ldquo;the best of all things for you is entirely unattainable: never
to have been born, not to <em>be</em>, to be <em>nothing</em>. But the
second best is for you&mdash;to die soon&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 3/KSA
1:35). Nietzsche, on this story, accepts the descriptive thesis of
pessimism, and he also believes the Greeks of the 6<sup>th</sup> and
5<sup>th</sup> centuries BC recognized its truth. The question, then,
is how to respond to the &ldquo;terrors and horrors of
existence&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 3/KSA 1:35); the best answer is
contained in Greek tragedy (specifically, the tragedies of Aeschylus
and Sophocles). One might suppose that another, perhaps preferable,
way to phrase the problem would be in terms of how to
<em>overcome</em> the &ldquo;terror and horror of existence,&rdquo; or
how to accept the descriptive thesis of pessimism while rejecting
Silenus&rsquo; (and Schopenhauer&rsquo;s) verdict on the value of
human life. But, for reasons canvassed below (see &sect;2.3), some
scholars believe that <em>The Birth</em> remains committed in some
sense to Schopenhauer&rsquo;s negative verdict on the value of life.
What is important for now is simply that, on the present proposal,
Nietzsche views <em>suffering</em>&mdash;in particular, its
predominance and inextricability&mdash;as the main problem facing
us.</p>

<p>
A competing proposal instead views lack of <em>meaning</em>&mdash;in
particular, the lack of meaning-conferring cultural
institutions&mdash;as the main problem to which Nietzsche addresses
himself, and not suffering per se (Gemes &amp; Sykes 2014, 2015; cf.
Tanner 2000, 8). Gemes and Sykes, e.g., read Nietzsche&rsquo;s project
in <em>The Birth</em> as inspired more by Wagner and the Romantic
tradition than by Schopenhauer (Gemes &amp; Sykes 2014,
100&ndash;101). As noted above, that tradition saw modernity as
characterized by a kind of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo;&mdash;a growing
sense that we no longer have a place of &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; in the
world. On this reading, Nietzsche is animated mainly by the same sorts
of concerns. And his aim in <em>The Birth</em> is to show how the
tragic festival can help us regain our lost sense of belonging by
providing our culture with an overarching, unifying
&ldquo;mythic&rdquo; worldview. Thus, remarking critically on the
contemporary state of German culture, Nietzsche says that
&ldquo;without myth, every culture forfeits its healthy, creative
natural power; only a horizon encircled by myth brings a whole
cultural movement to a unity&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 23/KSA 1:145).</p>

<p>
There is ample evidence in the text that Nietzsche is concerned both
with the problem of suffering and the problem of modern cultural
fragmentation. One need not place exclusive emphasis on either
problem, and they can even be seen as interrelated (see Huddleston
2019, 13&ndash;14). The feeling that one&rsquo;s life lacks some
sought for place of belonging may itself be the cause of great
psychological suffering. On the other hand, the ordinary suffering
endemic to life might be easier to bear if one feels that we are
&ldquo;in it together,&rdquo; so to speak, and this may prompt one to
seek such meaning. It is possible to see an even tighter and more
general connection between the two problems. For, arguably,
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimistic conclusion only follows from his
thesis that life is inescapably full of suffering <em>together</em>
with his rejection of traditional narratives about its meaning. The
Christian, for example, may admit that suffering is a problem, but
still conclude that life is worth living insofar as it achieves
something of value (e.g., an atonement for original sin). <em>The Birth
of Tragedy</em> might then be read as occupied neither with the
problem of suffering nor with the problem of meaning <em>as such</em>,
but with the problem of <em>meaningless suffering</em> (Came 2022,
44&ndash;45). Even if the two issues can be seen as related in this
way, there is still a question of emphasis. For, it may make a
difference to our interpretation of <em>The Birth</em> whether we see
Nietzsche&rsquo;s main interests as stemming from the Schopenhauerian
question about the justification of suffering, or from the Romantic
concern with cultural flourishing.</p>

<h3 id="MetBirTra">2.2 The Metaphysics of <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em></h3>

<p>
The most famous aspect of <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> is without
doubt Nietzsche&rsquo;s distinction between the
&ldquo;Apollonian&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dionysian.&rdquo; These terms
are first introduced (<em>BT</em> 1, 2) as names for two
&ldquo;<em>art drives</em>&rdquo; (<em>Kunsttriebe</em>) which are
originally operative in nature, and then derivatively associated with
distinct artistic paradigms. The paradigmatically representational
arts that deal in &ldquo;forms&rdquo; (painting, sculpture, epic
poetry) are associated with Apollo, whereas the paradigmatically
non-representational, or more typically &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; arts
(music and lyric poetry) are associated with Dionysus. One of
Nietzsche&rsquo;s main contentions in <em>The Birth</em> is that Greek
tragedy is a unique hybrid artform that combines and unifies the
Apollonian and Dionysian impulses. The former is manifested in the
dramatic dialogue and action, while the latter finds expression in the
musical accompaniment of the chorus.</p>

<p>
Yet, in many places throughout the book, Nietzsche appears to accord
the Apollonian/Dionysian duality a quite distinct, if distantly
related, significance. In this second sense, &lsquo;Apollonian&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Dionysian&rsquo; are ways of referring to two metaphysical
sides of the world &agrave; la Schopenhauer. The merely apparent world
of spatiotemporally discrete individuals, governed by causal laws, is
associated with Apollo, whereas the non-spatiotemporal monistic
reality underlying the appearances is associated with Dionysus. The
clear impression is that Nietzsche thus commits himself to
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s Transcendental Idealism and Will-Monism, that his
&ldquo;Apollo and Dionysus are &hellip; simply Representation and Will
in Greek costume&rdquo; (Nussbaum 1999, 358).</p>

<p>
Commentators divide over the question of how seriously Nietzsche
intends the metaphysical associations his key terms sometimes carry,
and indeed whether <em>The Birth</em> advances any metaphysical
doctrine at all. The orthodox reading has been that &ldquo;<em>The
Birth</em> incorporates without modification Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
metaphysics&rdquo; (Young 1992, 26; cf. Young 2006, 14; Silk &amp;
Stern 1981, 291; Geuss 2012; Soll 1998, 103; Clark 2015). This was,
indeed, the view of Nietzsche&rsquo;s closest friend and intellectual
confidant at the time, Erwin Rohde (see Rohde 1872), and the evidence
for it is clear and straightforward. Nietzsche calls Apollo the god of
the <em>principii individuationis</em> (principle of
individuation)&mdash;a scholastic term Schopenhauer uses to refer to
space, time, and causality qua merely subjective principles of the
mind (<em>BT</em> 1/KSA 1:28). Nietzsche repeatedly refers to a
&ldquo;primordial unity&rdquo; (<em>das Ur-Eine</em>),
&ldquo;will&rdquo; (<em>Wille</em>), or &ldquo;world-will&rdquo;
(<em>Weltwille</em>) that he associates with Dionysus and which he
apparently takes to transcend the empirical order (<em>BT</em> 1/KSA
1:24, 30, <em>BT</em> 3/KSA 1:37&ndash;38, <em>BT</em> 4/KSA
1:38&ndash;39, <em>BT</em> 5/KSA 1:43&ndash;44, <em>BT</em> 17/KSA
1:109, 112, <em>BT</em> 18/KSA 1:115, <em>BT</em> 21/KSA 1:135,
<em>BT</em> 22/KSA 1:141). Closely paraphrasing a passage from <em>The
World as Will and Representation</em> (<em>SW</em>
2:497&ndash;98/<em>WWR</em> 1:447), Nietzsche tells the reader
that,</p>

<blockquote>
The tremendous courage and wisdom of <em>Kant</em> and
<em>Schopenhauer</em> has achieved the most difficult victory, victory
over the optimism which lies hidden in the essence of logic&hellip; .
While the latter believed in the possibility of knowing and fathoming
[<em>die Erkennbarkeit und Ergr&uuml;ndlichkeit</em>] all riddles of
the world &hellip; and treated space, time and causality as entirely
unconditioned laws of the most universal validity, Kant revealed how
these laws really only serve to raise mere appearance, the work of
Maya, to the level of the sole and highest reality and to put it in
place of the innermost and true essence of things, and in this way to
make actual knowledge [<em>Erkenntniss</em>] of this essence
impossible, i.e., as Schopenhauer puts it, to lull the dreamer ever
deeper asleep. (<em>BT</em> 18/KSA 1:118)
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> seems, moreover, to endorse
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s theory of music (<em>BT</em> 5/KSA 1:46&ndash;7;
<em>BT</em> 16/KSA 1:46&ndash;7, 104&ndash;7), according to which
music is a direct &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of the noumenal Will. And,
finally, this theory along with the metaphysical picture on which it
relies appear to be directly implicated in Nietzsche&rsquo;s account
of tragedy&rsquo;s ultimate lesson:</p>

<blockquote>
It is only out of the spirit of music that we understand a joy in the
annihilation of the individual. For, the individual examples of such
annihilation only make clear to us the eternal phenomenon of Dionysian
art, which brings to expression the will in its omnipotence behind, so
to speak, the <em>principio individuationis</em>, eternal life beyond
all appearances and in spite of all annihilation. The metaphysical joy
in tragedy is a translation of the instinctive unconscious Dionysian
wisdom into the language of the image. (<em>BT</em> 16/KSA 1:108)
</blockquote>

<p>
For all the idiosyncrasies of Nietzsche&rsquo;s mode of expression,
such passages do seem to suggest a straightforward acceptance and
deployment of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s core metaphysical ideas.</p>

<p>
This received, metaphysical reading of <em>The Birth</em> is by no
means the consensus view, however. Indeed, the general trajectory of
recent scholarship has been toward rejecting it (Staten 1990,
187&ndash;216; Poellner 1998; Han-Pile 2006; Porter 2000; Gardner
2013, 603&ndash;6; Gemes &amp; Sykes 2014; Mulhall 2014, 261&ndash;63;
Daniels 2013, 69&ndash;71). The most plausible versions of this
reading admit that <em>The Birth</em> contains numerous metaphysical
claims, but hold that these are put forward in a self-consciously
fictional register.</p>

<p>
There are three key pieces of evidence for these anti-metaphysical
readings of <em>The Birth</em>. The first is an early notebook entry
(composed sometime between October 1867 and April 1868) entitled
&ldquo;On Schopenhauer&rdquo; (see FS 3.352&ndash;61/WEN 1&ndash;8).
This entry presents four criticisms of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
identification of the thing-in-itself with the Will, and seems to
conclude with a wholesale rejection of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
metaphysics. One of the main points is that Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
adherence to Kant&rsquo;s thesis that the world in-itself is
unknowable vitiates his attempt to offer any positive account of its
nature. If Nietzsche rejected the metaphysics of Will possibly as
early as 1867, then he could not, it is supposed, have seriously
intended to revive it in 1872.</p>

<p>
The second piece of evidence is the following, surprising passage from
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> itself:</p>

<blockquote>
It is an eternal phenomenon: the voracious will always finds a means,
through an illusion that it spreads over things, to chain its
creatures to life and to compel them to live on. One is captivated by
the Socratic lust for knowledge and the delusion [<em>Wahn</em>] of
being able to heal the eternal wound of existence through it; another
is ensnared by art&rsquo;s seductive veil of beauty that flutters
before his eyes; and yet another by <em>the metaphysical solace that
eternal life flows on indestructibly beneath the whirl of
appearances</em>. (<em>BT</em> 18/KSA 1:115, emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the description of the &ldquo;metaphysical solace&rdquo;
sounds remarkably close to the Schopenhauerian view that there is some
single willing being underlying the apparent world of individuation.
The passage appears to assert in no uncertain terms that this is only
an illusion; it is presented as on a par with the
&ldquo;Apollonian&rdquo; illusion that &ldquo;makes human existence
seem more beautiful than it really is&rdquo; (Han-Pile 2006, 382), and
the Socratic view, which Nietzsche rejects, that we can end human
suffering by coming to understand its causes (<em>BT</em> 15/KSA
1:97&ndash;102).</p>

<p>
The third datum for non-metaphysical readings is Nietzsche&rsquo;s
valorization throughout <em>The Birth</em> of &ldquo;myth.&rdquo; A
major theme of Nietzsche&rsquo;s early work, as noted above, is that
shared mythologies are essential for the flourishing of a culture:
Nietzsche&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of myth is not as such
evidence against a metaphysical interpretation of the book, since the
fact that he valorizes myth does not on its own show that he views his
metaphysics as a myth. However, it does provide a plausible rationale
for the otherwise baffling <em>BT</em> 18 (our second piece of
evidence). The idea is that, in those places of <em>The Birth</em>
where Nietzsche appears to advance a grand metaphysical theory, he is
really trying to supply late 19<sup>th</sup>-century German culture
with the sort of myth that he thinks it needs to flourish. His
confession in &sect;18 that that &ldquo;theory&rdquo; is an illusion
is an indication to the reader that this is what is going on. The most
developed version of this reading in found in Gemes &amp; Sykes 2014,
2015.</p>

<p>
How can proponents of the more orthodox metaphysical reading respond
to these apparently compelling pieces of evidence? With respect to the
first, some have suggested that, while Nietzsche did reject
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s identification of the thing-in-itself with the
Will on the grounds that the former is completely unknowable, he still
cleaved for a time to the basic dichotomy between a monistic Will and
a spatiotemporal realm of discrete individuals. On this revised
Schopenhauerian reading, the Will itself is degraded to the status of
an appearance, but an appearance that &ldquo;provides a
deep<em>er</em> account of the world than its description in terms of
material bodies&hellip; . &lsquo;Will&rsquo; is, then, &hellip; a
description of penultimate rather than ultimate reality&rdquo; (Young
2010, 92; cf. Ridley 2007, 26). Julian Young has suggested that this
sort of view in fact represents the position of the later Schopenhauer
himself (2010, 92; 2005, 96&ndash;98), thus making <em>The
Birth</em>&rsquo;s metaphysical picture still genuinely
Schopenhauerian. (Whether the later Schopenhauer actually degrades the
Will to the status of an appearance in this way is, of course,
controversial (see, e.g., Janaway 1999, 162&ndash;63; &Ouml;zen 2021,
261&ndash;63).)</p>

<p>
With respect to the second piece of evidence, it might be noted that
what Nietzsche specifically refers to as an illusion in <em>BT</em> 18
is the &ldquo;metaphysical <em>solace</em>,&rdquo; and it may not be
correct to identify this &ldquo;solace&rdquo; with the book&rsquo;s
metaphysics <em>per se</em>. Young (2006), e.g., reads the passage
from <em>BT</em> 18 as claiming, not that the Schopenhauerian
metaphysics of will is an illusion; it is rather the idea we get from
Dionysian tragedy&mdash;that life is <em>worth</em> living in spite of
its terrors&mdash;that is the illusion (15&ndash;16). It might also be
observed that, interpreted as a straightforward rejection of that
metaphysics, there is something especially peculiar about the passage
from <em>BT</em> 18. Suppose that by &lsquo;the metaphysical
solace&rsquo; Nietzsche really does mean &lsquo;the idea that there is
a single metaphysical Will underlying all appearances.&rsquo; Read
straightforwardly, then, the passage claims that the metaphysical Will
creates the illusion of its own existence (this peculiarity is noted
by Paul de Man (1979, 99&ndash;102) though he takes it as evidence
that <em>BT</em> aims to metatextually call its own claims into
question). This bizarre result would seem to suggest that we need a
more nuanced reading of the passage.</p>

<p>
There are not many direct attempts on behalf of orthodox readers to
rebut the third piece of evidence (and, in general, there has been to
date very little effort at developing a metaphysical reading of
<em>The Birth</em> that countenances the above evidence). As noted
already, however, the emphasis on the need for myth is not itself
evidence that <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s metaphysics is itself such a
myth. This theme lends credence to the anti-metaphysical hypothesis
only together with the other pieces of evidence. If proponents of the
orthodoxy have convincing explanations for these countervailing texts,
then perhaps they do not need to deal with directly with the issue of
myth. (For a discussion of the role of myth in <em>The Birth</em>,
which finds it compatible with taking the book&rsquo;s metaphysical
commitments seriously, see Young 2010, 130&ndash;31.)</p>

<h3 id="PesOptAesJusExi">2.3 Pessimism, Optimism, and the Aesthetic Justification of Existence</h3>

<p>
Interpreters diverge over the question of <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s
commitment to Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism just as they do over its
commitment to his metaphysics. One natural view, supported especially
by some of Nietzsche&rsquo;s retrospective comments about <em>The
Birth</em>, holds that the book contains a &ldquo;complete rejection
of the normative ethics of pessimism&rdquo; (Nussbaum 1999, 362; cf.
Kaufmann 1974, 131; Schacht 2001; Soll 1998, 100&ndash;101; Ridley
2019, 318&ndash;19). A competing view maintains that Nietzsche in fact
&ldquo;endorsed Schopenhauer&rsquo;s inference from the pain and
purposelessness of human existence to its worthlessness&rdquo; (Young
1992, 26; cf. Young 2006, 15&ndash;16; Geuss 2012, 47, 61; Huddleston
2019, 15, 19). Predictably, decisive textual evidence in favor of
either reading proves elusive. To be clear, the disagreement is not
over whether Nietzsche accepts the descriptive pessimistic thesis that
suffering is life&rsquo;s fundamental constituent&mdash;it is
generally agreed that the early Nietzsche is pessimistic in this
sense. Rather, the disagreement concerns his answer to the normative
question of whether life is, or is not, deserving of negation, whether
it would be better not to be.</p>

<p>
At first blush, the non-pessimistic reading is bound to appear the
most plausible. This reading can rely on Nietzsche&rsquo;s own later
remarks about <em>The Birth</em>. Writing in 1888, for example,
Nietzsche says that the book aimed to explain &ldquo;how the Greeks
got over pessimism&mdash;with what means they <em>overcame</em> it
&hellip; tragedy is precisely a proof of the fact that the Greeks were
<em>not</em> pessimists&rdquo; (<em>EH</em> &ldquo;Books,&rdquo;
BT:1). This sort of remark resonates with much of what Nietzsche says
in <em>The Birth</em> itself. &ldquo;The arts generally,&rdquo; he
claims there, &ldquo;make life possible and <em>worth
living</em>&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 1/KSA 1:27&ndash;28, emphasis added);
or again, &ldquo;<em>art</em> &hellip; alone is capable of turning
those thoughts of disgust with the horror or absurdity of existence
into representations with which one can live&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 7/KSA
1:57). And, of course, there is Nietzsche&rsquo;s overriding claim in
the book that &ldquo;only as an <em>aesthetic phenomenon</em> is [sic]
existence and the world eternally <em>justified</em>&rdquo;
(<em>BT</em> 5/KSA 1:47; cf. <em>BT</em> 24/KSA 1:152). If they are
genuinely <em>justified</em>, it would seem that Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
verdict&mdash;that they ought not to be&mdash;cannot be correct.</p>

<p>
Yet, <em>The Birth</em> does not speak unequivocally in favor of this
&ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; reading. For example, Nietzsche also says
that tragedy contains &ldquo;a profound and <em>pessimistic</em>
worldview,&rdquo; and communicates to us &ldquo;the conception of
individuation as the primordial ground of evil, &hellip; the hope that
the spell of individuation may be broken&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 10/KSA
1:73). That suffering arises from the pursuit of one&rsquo;s
individual interests and that salvation lies in freeing oneself from
these interests by piercing the &ldquo;veil&rdquo; of individuation
is, of course, precisely Schopenhauer&rsquo;s position. This
Schopenhauerian interpretation of tragedy is especially prominent in
Nietzsche&rsquo;s 1870 lecture course on <em>The Tragedy of
Sophocles</em>, where he states bluntly &ldquo;life appeared no longer
as worth living. Tragedy is pessimistic&rdquo; (KGA II.3, 10) and that
Sophocles&rsquo; &ldquo;teaching is unconditional submission and
resignation&rdquo; (KGA II.3, 27). Elsewhere he straightforwardly
identifies &ldquo;the content of the tragic myth&rdquo; with
&ldquo;the wisdom of Silenus&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 24/KSA
1:151)&mdash;the view that the best thing for human beings is never to
have been born. And, after telling us that tragedy aims at
transfiguration, he clarifies that what it transfigures is
&ldquo;least of all the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; of this world of
appearance, for it says to us precisely: &lsquo;Look! Look closely!
This is your life! This is the hour hand on the clock of your
existence!&rdquo; (<em>ibid.</em>). These seem odd ways, to put it
mildly, of expressing the idea that life is, in spite of it all,
justified and worth living. Proponents of a pessimistic reading can
also point to evidence that Nietzsche thinks both Apollonian art and
tragedy &ldquo;justify&rdquo; existence only by means of
<em>illusions</em> (e.g., <em>BT</em> 18/KSA 1:115&ndash;16). For if,
as this may suggest, art helps us affirm life only by deceiving us
about its quality, &ldquo;this implies that in the fullness of
knowledge one would <em>not</em> affirm life as worth living. It
implies, more briefly, that life is not worth living&rdquo; (Young
1992, 48).</p>

<p>
There are, at least in principle, two distinct questions here: did
Nietzsche endorse Schopenhauer&rsquo;s verdict about the value of
life? And, what does he think tragedy tells us (or what does he think
it told the Greeks) about the value of life? It is possible that
Nietzsche thought tragedy is life-affirming, but himself endorsed
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s life-denying stance. If this is right, however,
Nietzsche&rsquo;s position is highly unstable. Clearly, <em>The
Birth</em> aims not only to describe the normative outlook contained
in Greek tragedy, but also to, in some sense, advocate for it, and
would therefore be committed to recommending an attitude toward life
Nietzsche himself believes is unwarranted.</p>

<p>
The evidence regarding Nietzsche&rsquo;s attitude toward pessimism is
therefore equivocal. How we are best to interpret it depends to a
significant degree on how we interpret <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s
major thesis that tragedy offers an &ldquo;aesthetic
justification&rdquo; of existence. The thesis appears to be that
tragedy somehow encourages us to see the world&mdash;and the
inescapable presence in it of suffering, struggle, death,
etc.&mdash;from a god&rsquo;s-eye perspective. From this perspective,
the world as whole appears a terrible, but glorious spectacle, and our
lives&mdash;short and tormented though they may be&mdash;have an
aesthetic significance insofar as they occupy an integral place in
this aesthetically valuable whole, like shadows in a beautiful
painting or dissonances in a magnificent piece of music:</p>

<blockquote>
We may assume of ourselves that we are already images and artistic
projections for [the world&rsquo;s] true creator and have our highest
dignity in our significance as works of art&mdash;for only as an
<em>aesthetic phenomenon</em> is existence and the world eternally
<em>justified</em>. At the same time, our consciousness of this
significance of ours hardly differs from that which painted soldiers
on a canvas have of the battle depicted on it. (<em>BT</em> 5/KSA
1:47)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Precisely the tragic myth has to convince us that the ugly and
disharmonic is an artistic game, which the will, in the eternal
fullness of its pleasure [<em>Lust</em>], plays with itself. This
primordial phenomenon of Dionysian art, difficult to grasp, is made
directly understandable and comprehended immediately only in the
miraculous significance of <em>musical dissonance</em>: just as music
in general, placed next to the world, can give us a concept of what is
to be understood by the justification of the world as an aesthetic
phenomenon. The pleasure caused by the tragic myth has the same home
as the pleasurable sensation of dissonance in music. (<em>BT</em>
24/KSA 1:152)
</blockquote>

<p>
In this respect, then, the lesson Nietzsche thinks tragedy teaches us
closely resembles Leibniz&rsquo;s response to the problem of evil
(1697 [1989, 153]; on analogies between Nietzsche&rsquo;s project and
traditional projects in philosophical theodicy, see esp. Came 2004,
2005, 2022; May 2011). The mechanism by which Nietzsche thinks tragedy
communicates this lesson is obscure. However, the basic idea relies on
his idea that Greek spectators identified, not with the characters on
the stage, but with the tragic chorus, and from this perspective
experienced the drama as a mere ephemeral &ldquo;vision&rdquo;
(<em>BT</em> 8). And just as the chorus-audience relates to the
spectacle on the stage, so too does the primal unity relate to the
empirical world as a whole. The analogy, then, intimates to the
audience something of their metaphysical-cum-aesthetic significance
(<em>BT</em> 8, 10).</p>

<p>
Naturally, given the deep interpretive issues surrounding the status
of <em>The Birth&rsquo;</em>s metaphysics (see &sect;2.2 above), not
all agree that Nietzsche intends such talk of a
&ldquo;world-artist&rdquo; literally. And, it might be suspected that
whether one takes Nietzsche to be a pessimist or not depends on what
one thinks about the intended status of the metaphysical picture the
aesthetic justification of existence apparently encodes. If this
picture is intended to be true, then it would seem that tragedy is
supposed to show us that life really is justified. If, conversely, the
metaphysics is not so intended, then it would appear that the
so-called metaphysical solace is merely an illusion. In fact, these
issues can come apart. It is possible, for instance, that Nietzsche is
claiming that when watching a tragedy we catch a glimpse of what the
world <em>would</em> look like from a god&rsquo;s-eye perspective,
even if nothing really occupies that perspective. The question, then,
is only whether the world would manifest aesthetic value if seen in
this way, and not whether there is any being to whom it does manifest
such value. Conversely, not all proponents of the metaphysical
interpretation of <em>The Birth</em> conclude that Nietzsche believes
life is genuinely justified. Young, for example, argues that the
fact</p>

<blockquote>
that pain and death are indispensable to <em>life as an entertainment
for the primordial unity</em> &hellip; does nothing at all to justify
life to those who&mdash;like Christians in the Roman arena&mdash;have
the misfortune to have to be <em>parts of</em> the
entertainment&hellip; . To the question of whether <em>life as a human
individual</em> is worth living, <em>The Birth</em> replies with the
same &lsquo;No&rsquo; as does Schopenhauer. (2006, 24)
</blockquote>

<p>
Evidently, much depends here on how we understand the status of the
world&rsquo;s alleged aesthetic value. If that value consists merely
in the fact that it happens to please the &ldquo;primordial
unity,&rdquo; then this sort of reading seems plausible. If, on the
other hand, that value is supposed to be of a non-agent relative sort,
then the reading might be resisted.</p>

<p>
A further question, though one which is less often thematized,
concerns the relation between the aesthetic justification of existence
and what Nietzsche frequently calls &ldquo;the metaphysical solace
[<em>Trost</em>]&rdquo;&mdash;something with which, he argues,
&ldquo;every true tragedy leaves us&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 7/KSA 1:56).
It is natural to suppose that this solace consists precisely in the
idea that existence is aesthetically justified. However, some
characterisations of the metaphysical solace seem to differ
substantively from this idea. Nietzsche describes the
&ldquo;metaphysical joy in the tragic&rdquo; as rooted in the
recognition that &ldquo;the hero &hellip; is ultimately only
appearance, and the eternal life of the will is untouched by his
annihilation&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 16/KSA 1:108). The
&ldquo;metaphysical solace&rdquo; lies in the thought &ldquo;that
under the whirl of appearances eternal life flows on
indestructibly&rdquo; (<em>BT</em> 18/KSA 1:115). Though each seems to
depend on <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s metaphysics, the idea that the
world is justified as an aesthetic spectacle and the idea that there
is something in us which survives death would appear to be quite
distinct thoughts. The former idea might incline us to an overall
optimistic reading of the text, if we assume that such a justification
could be a genuine one, whereas the latter, which suggests that
redemption from this life will be found in some metaphysical beyond,
would incline toward a more pessimistic interpretation.</p>

<p>
One interesting way of mediating between pessimistic and
non-pessimistic interpretations of the early Nietzsche is proposed by
Wolt (2025), who draws special attention to affinities with the views
of Nietzsche&rsquo;s older colleague and friend, the cultural
historian Jacob Burckhardt (1818&ndash;1897). According to this
proposal, Nietzsche is genuinely pessimistic inasmuch as he takes life
in its typical form to be intrinsically bad, and thus rejects a
broadly Christian view according to which every life has an innate
positive worth. Yet this pessimistic thesis allows that certain
exceptional lives may still achieve a value that makes them worth
living. Though Wolt does not develop this interpretation specifically
with an eye to Nietzsche&rsquo;s theory of tragedy, it is not
difficult to see how it might apply. Tragedy may be pessimistic
insofar as it shows us the lamentable character of life as it
typically occurs, but optimistic insofar as it hints at a way in which
life could attain value.</p>

<h2 id="ArtIll">3. Art and Illusion</h2>

<p>
Nietzsche&rsquo;s aesthetic thought is centrally, if often only
obliquely, engaged with Plato&rsquo;s. In the <em>Genealogy</em>,
Nietzsche dubs Plato &ldquo;the greatest enemy of art Europe has yet
produced&rdquo; (<em>GM</em> III.25), referring, of course, to
<em>Republic</em> X&rsquo;s attack on the imitative or illusory nature
of much art, which accordingly appeals to &ldquo;a part of us that is
far from reason&rdquo; (603a). This engagement is hardly surprising
given that the main target of Plato&rsquo;s censure is Greek tragedy,
the very artform which centrally occupied Nietzsche in his first
philosophical work, and which would, to a greater or lesser extent,
continue to occupy him through his final writings (see &sect;6 below).
What is more surprising are Nietzsche&rsquo;s reasons for disagreeing
with the <em>Republic</em>&rsquo;s verdict: he does not typically deny
the central charge that art is false; he instead questions the value
Plato (and most of the rest of us, for that matter) place on the
truth. This central theme of Nietzsche&rsquo;s thought is evident
already in <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s valorization of Apollonian
semblance, and denigration of &ldquo;Alexandrian&rdquo;
culture&mdash;Nietzsche&rsquo;s term of abuse for a society which
accords the highest value to scholarship and science instead of to
art. Shortly before <em>The Birth</em>, Nietzsche had written:
&ldquo;my philosophy is <em>inverted Platonism</em>: the further
something is from true being, the more beautiful, the better it is.
Living in semblance [<em>Schein</em>] as the goal&rdquo; (NF 1870:
7[156]). Much later in his career, he continues to speak approvingly
of art as a &ldquo;cult of the untrue&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
<em>good</em> will to semblance&rdquo; (<em>GS</em> 107), in which
&ldquo;the <em>lie</em> sanctifies itself, in which the <em>will to
illusion</em> [T&auml;uschung] has the good conscience on its
side&rdquo; (<em>GM</em> III.25). And in notes from his final
productive year, he writes: &ldquo;the truth is ugly: <em>we have
art</em> so that we do not perish from the truth&rdquo; (NF 1888:
16[40]). Nietzsche is opposed, in short, both to Plato&rsquo;s
condemnation of artistic illusion, and to theories, like
Schopenhauer&rsquo;s or Schelling&rsquo;s, that try to make art into
the source of some deep, metaphysical truth. Art <em>is</em> false,
and it is valuable (at least in part) <em>because</em> of its
falsity.</p>

<p>
There are several basic interpretive questions to ask here: (1) in
what sense is art &ldquo;false&rdquo; according to Nietzsche? (2) Why
does he think artistic falsity is valuable? And (3) how does this
valorization cohere with his own views about the value of
truthfulness? In approaching these questions, it is useful to keep in
mind a simple distinction drawn by Stoll (2019, 332&ndash;33). Art
might be <em>representationally</em> false, say, by attributing
properties to the things it represents that they do not possess, or by
expressing, implicitly or explicitly, false propositions. In contrast,
art might be <em>mimetically</em> false because it is illusory,
&ldquo;fake,&rdquo; non-genuine, merely resembles without really being
what it depicts. In the first sense, &lsquo;false&rsquo; is being used
roughly in the way it typically is in, e.g., epistemology. In the
second sense, it is being used in the way it is when we speak of a
&ldquo;false friend&rdquo; or &ldquo;false teeth.&rdquo; These senses
clearly come apart; an object like a set of false teeth has no
representational or propositional content, and a portrait painting
might capture its subject&rsquo;s likeness with tremendous accuracy
while (and perhaps for that very reason) creating a powerful
illusion.</p>

<p>
The prevailing tendency is to see Nietzsche as claiming that art is
representationally false, and specifically as misrepresenting the
undesirable or unaffirmable aspects of life. The following remarks
seem to capture his position his well: &ldquo;the role of art is to
supply a (dishonest) fantasy that is to replace a reality that one
cannot face&rdquo; (Ridley 2007, 140); &ldquo;art must represent life
as beautiful, as affirmable, precisely because life is <em>not</em>
beautiful&rdquo; (Young 1992, 134); &ldquo;artistic representation
falsifies its object by depicting it as other than it is&rdquo; (Came
2013, 220; cf. May 1999, 29&ndash;36; Janaway 2014). Assuming that
Nietzsche is best interpreted in something like this manner, there are
still several different ways art might be taken to be
misrepresentational. First, and most straightforwardly, art might
misrepresent what it overtly depicts. For example, a portrait painter
might idealize some of her subject&rsquo;s features, remove certain
blemishes, and so forth. Second, art might misrepresent
&ldquo;life&rdquo; or the &ldquo;world&rdquo; in some more general
way, say, by implicitly or explicitly expressing false propositions
about it, or otherwise suggesting a non-veridical outlook of some
sort. For example, while <em>Macbeth</em> is on one level about
specific members of the medieval Scottish nobility, perhaps its
&ldquo;real&rdquo; message is that traitors meet a sorry end, and this
message is not (without exception) true. Along similar lines, but much
more generally, Nietzsche sometimes suggests that the world &ldquo;in
itself&rdquo; simply lacks &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; and
&ldquo;order&rdquo; (e.g. <em>GS</em> 109, 299). So, perhaps he thinks
that art misrepresents the world simply to the extent that it
represents things beautifully. Third, art might misrepresent by being
fictional, in the sense of representing things which do not exist,
rather than distorting what does exist. Greek art, for example, is
preoccupied with mythical stories about non-existent gods, heroes,
monsters, and so forth. And, presumably, Nietzsche would consider
Christian art&mdash;with its various narratives about saints,
prophets, miracles, and the like&mdash;false in just the same way.</p>

<p>
If one or more of the above types of misrepresentation best capture
Nietzsche&rsquo;s conception of artistic falsity, then it is natural
to suppose that the value of such falsehoods lies primarily in their
content. A key facet of Nietzsche&rsquo;s thought is the idea that it
can be better, from a pragmatic perspective, to hold false beliefs
than to hold true beliefs (<em>BGE</em> 3). We might then suspect that
the value of artistic misrepresentations is rooted in the fact that
their content is nonetheless &ldquo;life-promoting.&rdquo; Thus, for
example, Gemes and Sykes have argued that tragedy fosters &ldquo;the
belief in a unity which underlies the apparent world, and offers the
myth that in death, the individual will find redemption and
reunification with the reality beneath appearance&rdquo; (2014, 93).
While the later Nietzsche may prefer less Schopenhauerian myths, he
may still retain the basic structure of this conception of the value
of artistic falsehood.</p>

<p>
There are several problems, both philosophical and textual, with the
above sort of view. One philosophical problem with the kind of
aesthetic beautification Nietzsche sometimes seems to have in mind is
that it arguably conflates representing something as beautiful with
representing it beautifully (cf. Huddleston 2022, 125). So, the
portraitist might depict her subject as more beautiful than he is, and
thus misrepresent him. But, it is far from clear that Homer&rsquo;s
<em>Iliad</em>&mdash;or Malick&rsquo;s <em>The Thin Red Line</em>, for
that matter&mdash;misrepresent war as beautiful simply in virtue of
being beautiful stories about war. Relatedly, we do not often infer
that properties attributed to objects by works of art are properties
those objects actually possess. If Nietzsche&rsquo;s conception of
artistic falsity depends on the assumption that we are deceived by it,
then he is assuming art appreciators to be far more gullible than they
typically are (though, for a reading according to which Nietzsche does
not need this assumption, see Reginster 2014, 15&ndash;23).</p>

<p>
The above sort of reading also raises interpretive puzzles. For one,
as Aaron Ridley observes (2013, 421), whether a work of art is
misrepresentational in any of the above senses seems to be a purely
contingent matter. But, Nietzsche appears to think that art is
<em>necessarily</em> false, or at least that art and falsity are very
intimately related. Second, Nietzsche himself often appears opposed to
precisely the conception of aesthetic beautification it is tempting to
attribute to him (cf. Young 1992, 42&ndash;43). He suggests
approvingly that &ldquo;art also brings much that is ugly, hard, and
questionable about life to appearance&rdquo; (<em>TI</em>
&ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo; 24) and claims that &ldquo;the good, strong
will of the older Hellene&rdquo; was characterized by a
&ldquo;<em>longing for the ugly</em>&rdquo; (<em>ASC</em> 4). Finally,
it is unclear how Nietzsche&rsquo;s insistence on the value of
artistic falsity coheres with his broader normative commitments.
Specifically, and as Ridley (2007) in particular has argued (cf.
Reginster 2014, 25&ndash;29), the suggestion that art supplies us with
life-affirming fictions seems to conflict with Nietzsche&rsquo;s
conception of life-affirmation as requiring &ldquo;that one does not
want to have anything differently &hellip; not merely to endure what
is necessary, still less to conceal it &hellip; but to love it&rdquo;
(<em>EH</em> &ldquo;Clever&rdquo; 10). There is a broader question
here about the extent of Nietzsche&rsquo;s commitment to the ideal
truthfulness (see Janaway 2024, for an exploration of many of the
difficult issues involved). But the idea that the need to conceal
certain difficult facts about reality from oneself expresses a kind of
contemptible cowardice is a consistent theme in Nietzsche&rsquo;s
later works (e.g., <em>BGE</em> 39, 227; <em>A</em> 54; <em>EH</em>
Preface 3, &ldquo;Books&rdquo; BT:2). Nietzsche&rsquo;s apparent
suggestion that we need art precisely to conceal such facts from
ourselves evidently conflicts with that idea.</p>

<p>
There are a number of potential responses to this last difficulty. One
is to suggest that Nietzsche fails to entirely resolve it (Ridley
2007, 123&ndash;27), or leaves it unresolved specifically to call
attention to what he takes to be genuine tensions in our values
(Janaway 2014, 51&ndash;56). Another proposal holds that his view
develops away from the idea that art should be in any sense false
(Reginster 2014). More ecumenically, one might suggest that Nietzsche
sees art and truthfulness as competing &ldquo;regulative ideals&rdquo;
which have to be appropriately balanced against one another (Anderson
2005, 203&ndash;11), or that art is permitted to misrepresent, but
only those aspects of life that we cannot change or otherwise accept
(Ridley 2007, 80&ndash;83; 2013, 422&ndash;23). According to these
sorts of readings, Nietzsche may advocate <em>maximal</em> honesty
while still recognizing that life-affirmation might ultimately require
some degree of falsification. One problem for this suggestion is that
Nietzsche appears to insist that it is precisely the
<em>necessary</em> aspects of existence we must acknowledge and affirm
(<em>EH</em> &ldquo;Clever&rdquo; 10; cf. NF 1888: 16[32]).</p>

<p>
A contrasting approach to Nietzsche&rsquo;s views on artistic falsity
is developed by Stoll (2019; cf. Page 2024). According to this
approach, Nietzsche&rsquo;s primary interest is in mimetic falsity, in
the fact emphasized by Plato that much art is centrally occupied with
imitating, with producing semblances or simulacra of the things it
depicts. It was, recall, this sense of falsity that was at issue in
Schiller&rsquo;s conception of <em>Schein</em> (see &sect;1.3 above),
which had been important for Nietzsche since early in his career.
Nietzsche can thus consistently say that art is false while denying
that it should falsely beautify things; its falsity is a function of
the medium not the representational content. Divorced as it is from
the content of specific works, this account of artistic falsehood can
arguably make good sense of the tight connection Nietzsche seems to
see between art and illusion (though certain artforms, such as music
or architecture, may still pose problems). It also suggests that the
aim of art is not to instil in us a set of false, but useful beliefs.
Instead, art glorifies or celebrates illusion and falsity themselves,
inviting us to reconsider our&mdash;mostly negative and, Nietzsche
thinks, unhealthy&mdash;attitude toward them. Stoll argues that this
interpretation allows us to locate the underlying consistency between
Nietzsche&rsquo;s ideal of uncompromising honesty and his valorization
of art in a way that does not require the balancing approach suggested
by Ridley and Anderson (Stoll 2019, 339&ndash;42).</p>

<p>
Whether this solves the textual problem depends to some degree on how
we think of the positive value art accords to falsity. If to value
something positively is to be inclined to pursue or promote it, then
it might seem the answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Yet, not all positive
valuing is like this for Nietzsche. He thinks, for example, that it is
possible for the nobleperson to have &ldquo;reverence&rdquo;
(<em>Ehrfurcht</em>) and even &ldquo;love&rdquo; for an <em>enemy</em>
whom they aim to defeat (<em>GM</em> I.10). To suggest that it is
better for us to be positively disposed to illusion might, but
<em>need not</em> be to say that it is better for us to cleave to
benighted self-conceptions.</p>

<h2 id="BeaDisCre">4. Beauty, Disinterestedness, and Creativity</h2>

<p>
One of the more significant developments Nietzsche&rsquo;s aesthetics
undergoes in the time between <em>The Birth</em> and his later works
concerns the idea of disinterested aesthetic appreciation. While the
early Nietzsche apparently accepts some version of the thesis that
aesthetic pleasure is disinterested, he consistently rejects it by at
least 1886 (e.g., <em>BGE</em> 33; though, for a dissenting view
according to which Nietzsche&rsquo;s later aesthetics is still wedded
to a broadly Schopenhauerian version of aesthetic disinterest, see
(Denham 2014)). The best-known discussion of this issue in the later
works comes in <em>GM</em> III.6, where it is connected with an
intriguing, albeit obscure, criticism of aestheticians&mdash;Kant and
Schopenhauer are singled out in particular&mdash;who take their cue
&ldquo;purely from the standpoint of the &lsquo;spectator&rsquo;
[<em>vom</em> <em>&lsquo;Zuschauer&rsquo; aus</em>]&rdquo; (KSA
5:346).</p>

<p>
There are a few obvious questions to be had here. First, what is
Nietzsche&rsquo;s criticism of the notion of aesthetic disinterest?
This notion has meant different things to different philosophers, and
how extensive and successful his criticism is will depend in part on
how he understands the notion. Second, how is this criticism related
to his apparent preference for an aesthetics that focuses on
&ldquo;the experiences of the artist (the creator)&rdquo; rather than
on those of the spectator? Schopenhauer, after all, believes that the
creative genius is someone uniquely capable of attaining a state of
pure, will-less cognition (<em>SW</em> 3:430&ndash;31/<em>WWR</em>
2:393&ndash;94); it is not immediately obvious that looking at the
artist will cast suspicion on disinterestedness. Perhaps
Nietzsche&rsquo;s point is that Schopenhauer only reads his faulty
theory of aesthetic spectatorship into the creative process. If this
is right, then we may still wonder why we should prefer an aesthetics
of the creator. Answers to these obvious questions may depend on
answers to some more subtle questions. For instance, what precisely
would we be looking at in considering &ldquo;the experiences of the
artist?&rdquo; Artists&rsquo; own judgments of what is
beautiful/aesthetically valuable? The nature of the creative process?
Something else entirely? Nietzsche faults Kant and Schopenhauer for
&ldquo;envisioning the aesthetic problem&rdquo; from the
spectator&rsquo;s point of view. What is this &ldquo;aesthetic
problem?&rdquo; It is plausible to suppose that he has in mind the
question of the nature of the beautiful (Ridley 2011), but Nietzsche
does not explicitly say.</p>

<p>
Zangwill (2013) provides one plausible set of answers to these sorts
of questions. On his reading, Nietzsche&rsquo;s objection to Kantian
aesthetics concerns more its emphasis on the universality of
judgements of taste than their disinterestedness (though, of course,
the two issues are not unrelated for Kant). More specifically,
Nietzsche&rsquo;s main target, on this reading, is the idea that
beauty is <em>universally available</em>. Nietzsche need not be read
as claiming that no beauty is so available, only that &ldquo;some
beauty, higher beauty, can be grasped only by a select few&rdquo;
(Zangwill 2013, 84). This yields one potential way of understanding
the objection to aesthetic disinterest and its connection with the
spectator. The thought would be that there are some types or instances
of beauty which are best or only accessible through &ldquo;enhanced
ecstatic experiences&rdquo; (ibid., 90), not through dispassionate
reflection. And if it is specifically artists who are capable of such
experiences, or who are most saliently aware of having had such
experiences, then there is reason to find fault with an aesthetics
that focuses solely on the experience of the artistic laity. This
account, of course, raises questions of its own. Why, for example,
should the &ldquo;select few&rdquo; capable of grasping higher beauty
be identified with artists? And why should disinterested aesthetic
experience itself not also be the province of a select few? Even if
Kant is right that I can only legitimately require agreement from
everyone if my aesthetic judgment is disinterested, it might still be
the case that, as a matter of fact, most are unable to judge
disinterestedly. Schopenhauer, for one, appears to think that the
capacity for genuine will-less cognition is exceedingly rare.</p>

<p>
Note that Zangwill&rsquo;s approach treats &lsquo;experiences of the
artist&rsquo; and &lsquo;the aesthetic problem&rsquo; as referring to
judgements or perceptions of beauty. A more radical interpretation
finds Nietzsche critical of the very idea that the aesthetic state is
to be construed in such &ldquo;passive&rdquo; terms to begin with. On
this view, &ldquo;the significance of art is to be found less in its
<em>products</em> than in the <em>creative activity</em> by which they
are produced&rdquo; (Reginster 2014, 25; cf. Soll 1998, 108ff.). Here,
the problem with a spectator&rsquo;s aesthetics is that it locates
aesthetic value in the wrong place&mdash;works of art, or the
experiences they cause&mdash;or at least fails to see that such value
can be located elsewhere as well (cf. Huddleston 2020, 5). In its most
extreme version, the view is that beautiful objects are &ldquo;only
by-products, and their beauty is merely a reflection of a &hellip;
beauty that is, in the first place and most authentically, the
artist&rsquo;s own&rdquo; (Ridley 2011, 321).</p>

<p>
What, if anything, can be said in favor of such a view, and how is it
connected with Nietzsche&rsquo;s criticism of disinterestedness? One
suggestion is that the spectator&rsquo;s standpoint cannot account for
the artist&rsquo;s motivation to create a work (Soll 1998, 108;
Reginster 2014, 24). This is particularly problematic if the genius is
conceived along Schopenhauerian lines&mdash;as someone possessing a
heightened ability for perceiving nature in the purely intellectual,
will-less manner, supposedly characteristic of all aesthetic
enjoyment. The question is why, having achieved this state themselves,
the artist should be motivated to make it available to others in the
form of an artwork. One might of course wonder what this psychological
question has to do with the question of the nature of beauty. After
all, it is hardly clear that a successful theory of beauty has also to
explain what motivates artistic creation. A potential response, here,
would be that Nietzsche operates under the general assumption, shared
with Schopenhauer, that the state from which the artist creates is the
same as the state that their work aims to produce (Young 1992, 120).
If conceiving the latter in terms of disinterestedness cannot explain
the possibility of the former, such a theory would then need to be
rejected. (For a critical assessment of the argument here, see (ibid.,
121&ndash;25).)</p>

<p>
In addition to its critical reflections on earlier aesthetic theories,
<em>GM</em> III.6 also gives us some indication of Nietzsche&rsquo;s
own positive account of beauty or positive aesthetic value. The
section quotes approvingly a claim from Stendhal&rsquo;s <em>Rome,
Naples et Florence</em> (1817) that &ldquo;the beautiful is a promise
of happiness,&rdquo; and Stendhal is said to constitute, in contrast
to Kant and Schopenhauer, a &ldquo;<em>genuine</em> spectator.&rdquo;
One important question, here, is whether the fact that Stendhal is
called a &ldquo;spectator&rdquo; means that Nietzsche regards even his
definition of beauty as in some sense deficient (Ridley 2011). Most,
however, take Nietzsche to be adopting Stendhal&rsquo;s definition.
What, then, is the import of this definition? In his later works,
Nietzsche often associates the experience of beauty with the feeling
of power and with erotic arousal. A particularly developed
interpretation focusing on these associations is (Reginster 2014; cf.
Soll 1998; Ridley 2011, 319&ndash;25). Reginster&rsquo;s reading takes
inspiration from Nehamas&rsquo;s recent theory of beauty (2007).
According to this theory, to find something beautiful is not to
experience or judge it to be of positive value&mdash;aesthetic
experience is not a &ldquo;verdict.&rdquo; To find something beautiful
is rather to be impelled to continue engaging with it, to get to know
it better. The version of this theory that Reginster locates in
Nietzsche holds similarly that to find something beautiful is, not to
find oneself in a state of passive enjoyment, but to be impelled by it
toward &ldquo;<em>new artistic creation</em>&rdquo; (2014, 31). This
sort of account offers a way of making sense of Nietzsche&rsquo;s
somewhat surprising approval (<em>TI</em> &ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo;
22&ndash;23) of Plato&rsquo;s definition of love in the
<em>Symposium</em> as &ldquo;reproduction and birth in beauty&rdquo;
(206e). Here, one might think too of the way in which we speak both of
artistic geniuses as &ldquo;inspired,&rdquo; and of their works as
&ldquo;inspiring.&rdquo; It also promises to cast further light on
Nietzsche&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with conceptions of aesthetic
pleasure as disinterested. If we assume that activity is inherently
interested, and if to find something beautiful is to be impelled by it
to some kind of activity, then it would seem appreciation of the
beautiful could not be disinterested. (For another sophisticated
account of Nietzsche&rsquo;s conception of beauty that emphasizes the
dimension of erotic arousal, see Leiter 2018, and for a compelling
proposal connecting it to Nietzsche&rsquo;s remarks about
glorification and praise, Fox 2020.)</p>

<p>
Not all of Nietzsche&rsquo;s remarks about beauty and aesthetic value
sit naturally with these functional sorts of definition. Especially in
his discussions of self-creation, though in other contexts as well, he
seems to operate with a more traditional understanding of beauty as
harmony or unity amongst diversity. He likens beauty to &ldquo;order,
division, form&rdquo; (<em>GS</em> 109), to the imposition of a
coherent style (<em>GS</em> 290), and this imposition is described as
involving the ability &ldquo;to become master over the chaos that one
is; to compel one&rsquo;s chaos to become form; to become necessity in
form: to become logical, simple, unequivocal, mathematics; to become
<em>law</em>&rdquo; (NF 1888: 14[61]). These very same aesthetic
standards are deployed&mdash;fairly or not&mdash;against
Wagner&rsquo;s alleged stylistic decadence:</p>

<blockquote>
With what does every <em>literary</em> d&eacute;cadence distinguish
itself? By the fact that life no longer dwells in the whole. The word
becomes souvrain and leaps out of the sentence, the sentence reaches
out and eclipses the sense of the page, the page wins life at the cost
of the whole&mdash;the whole is no longer a whole. But that is the
image for every style of d&eacute;cadence: every time anarchy of
atoms, disintegration of the will. (<em>CW</em> 7)
</blockquote>

<p>
In these contexts, Nietzsche seems to adopt the conception of beauty,
common amongst the eighteenth-century rationalists, as a kind of
&ldquo;perfection&rdquo; or <em>organic</em> <em>unity</em> (see
Hassan 2022, for a particularly sophisticated treatment of Nietzsche
on organic unity; cf. Soll 1998, 102&ndash;105). Here, beauty (or at
least aesthetic value of some kind) seems to be treated as a perfectly
objective property of beautiful objects rather than, say, a mere
invitation to further activity. This is not to say that these two
strands could not in principle be connected. Ridley (2013,
419&ndash;20), for example, emphasizes the close connection Nietzsche
often draws between creativity and <em>form-giving</em>. If Nietzsche
does endorse the above-mentioned Schopenhauerian view that there is a
kind of parity between creative activity and the aesthetic experience,
he might maintain that seeing an object as &ldquo;formed chaos&rdquo;
is precisely what incites us to creativity ourselves.</p>

<h2 id="AesPhy">5. Aesthetics and Physiology</h2>

<p>
In the <em>Genealogy</em>, Nietzsche remarks parenthetically that he
will one day write a &ldquo;<em>Physiology of Aesthetics</em>&rdquo;
(<em>GM</em> III.8), and in <em>The Case of Wagner</em> (published the
following year) he refers prospectively to &ldquo;a chapter of my
magnum opus, which carries the title &lsquo;toward a physiology of
art&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>CW</em> 7). The plan for this work never came
to fruition, though some material appearing under that heading in
Nietzsche&rsquo;s notebooks seems to have been utilized in the
writings of his final year, particularly in <em>Twilight of the
Idols</em> (cf. NF 1888: 17[9], <em>TI</em> &ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo;
8&ndash;11, 19&ndash;24)<em>.</em> One of the most extreme claims from
this period comes in <em>Nietzsche contra Wagner</em>:
&ldquo;Aesthetics is indeed nothing but an applied physiology&rdquo;
(<em>NCW</em> &ldquo;Objections&rdquo;). These remarks are largely
promissory, and further textual evidence for the shape of the
envisioned &ldquo;physiology of art/aesthetics&rdquo; is relatively
thin. Nevertheless, some scholars have argued that the biological
sciences are central to Nietzsche&rsquo;s mature aesthetic theory.</p>

<p>
Moore (2002, 85&ndash;111) sees Nietzsche as part of a post-Darwinian
tradition of German thinkers, along e.g. with Ernst Haeckel
(1834&ndash;1919), aiming for evolutionary explanations of aesthetic
experience. A Darwinist interpretation is developed, in particular, in
Richardson 2004 (219&ndash;70). According to Richardson, Nietzsche
believes that evolution selects for a tendency to discriminate between
traits associated with fitness and those not so associated, and to
find pleasure in the former and displeasure in the latter
(236&ndash;43; cf. Stern 2020, 58). This reading can explain well
Nietzsche&rsquo;s tendency to associate aesthetic experience with
sexuality (e.g., <em>GM</em> III.6; <em>TI</em>
&ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo; 22&ndash;23), as well as his occasional
privileging of human beauty (<em>TI</em> &ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo; 20).
It will apparently struggle to explain why we find beautiful a vast
array of things&mdash;instrumental music, abstract art, non-human
animals, landscapes, etc.&mdash;that are not humans (cf. Janaway 2007,
190). Nietzsche might suggest that the features we find beautiful in
non-human objects are those that remind us in some way of physical
human beauty. Such a suggestion might be broadly in the spirit of
Burke&rsquo;s theory that the same general qualities which make for
beautiful human bodies (smoothness, relative smallness, etc.) are the
qualities which also cause us to find beautiful non-human objects.
Alternatively, Nietzsche might appeal, in proto-Freudian fashion, to a
sublimation of the sex-drive (e.g., <em>GM</em> III.8; cf. Moore 2002,
106&ndash;7). As noted in the previous section, one plausible reading
holds that the experience of the beautiful, for Nietzsche as for
Plato, involves being spurred toward creativity. Thus, the pleasure
taken in a sunset or a Beethoven symphony might be said to be
&ldquo;erotic&rdquo; to the extent that it puts us in this general
sort of state, even if it does not involve arousal or the desire for
literal procreation.</p>

<p>
A distinct, if potentially related point of contact between physiology
and art is Nietzsche&rsquo;s frequent use of medical concepts when
assessing art and artists in his later writings. Art of which he
disapproves&mdash;especially Wagner&rsquo;s art&mdash;is castigated as
&ldquo;decadent&rdquo; (<em>d&eacute;cadent</em>) or
&ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; (<em>entartete</em>), whereas the art of e.g.
Raphael, Bizet, or Goethe is celebrated as &ldquo;healthy,&rdquo; and
a &ldquo;stimulus to life&rdquo; (<em>TI</em> &ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo;
24). To call an artist or their work &ldquo;decadent&rdquo; might be
to make a functional or an expressive claim. Both sorts of claims can
be found in the text, and are sometimes made in the same
breath&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;is Wagner even a human being? Is he not
rather a sickness? &hellip; <em>He has made music sick</em>&rdquo;
(<em>CW</em> 5). The claim would appear to be that decadent art, like
Wagner&rsquo;s, is both a &ldquo;symptom&rdquo; of the artist&rsquo;s
own degeneration, as well as a kind of &ldquo;contagion,&rdquo; and
garners rebuke on both grounds. In other contexts, however, Nietzsche
suggests a slightly different point. In a well-known passage from
<em>The Gay Science</em>, for example, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
Every art, every philosophy, may be viewed as an aid and means of
salvation for growing, struggling life: they always presuppose
suffering and sufferers. But there are two types of sufferers: those
who suffer from the <em>overabundance of life</em>, who want a
Dionysian art and likewise a tragic view of and insight into
life&mdash;and then those who suffer from the <em>impoverishment of
life</em>, who seek quiet, stillness, a placid sea, redemption from
themselves through art and knowledge. (<em>GS</em> 370)
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Nietzsche appears to be sounding a theme that was with him since
<em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>&mdash;that art is one of
humanity&rsquo;s fundamental means for coping with the suffering
endemic to life. Now, however, he comes to think that not all
suffering is equal; some suffering is &ldquo;healthy,&rdquo; while
other suffering is &ldquo;sick.&rdquo; Nietzsche clearly signals his
approval for art that responds to suffering of the former kind. Note,
however, that this need not mean he disapproves of the latter sort of
art on functional grounds; such art may be genuinely good for those
who need it, and otherwise innocuous. Instead, his objection may be to
the fact that such art perforce expresses an evaluative outlook of
which he disapproves (cf. Ridley 2007, 124).</p>

<p>
In still other contexts, Nietzsche develops this general idea in the
direction of what appears to be an unusual form of aesthetic
non-cognitivism. After claiming that &ldquo;aesthetics is irrevocably
tied to these biological presuppositions [of &lsquo;ascending&rsquo;
or &lsquo;declining&rsquo; life],&rdquo; he suggests that &ldquo;these
opposing forms in the optics of values &hellip; are ways of seeing,
which one cannot get at with reasons and refutations. ...&nbsp;One
does not refute a disease of the eye. ... The concepts
&lsquo;true&rsquo; and &lsquo;untrue,&rsquo; it seems to me, have no
meaning in optics&rdquo; (<em>CW</em> Epilogue). The suggestion
appears to be that, when we make judgments of the form &lsquo;x is
beautiful,&rsquo; we are not making truth-apt claims so much as
expressing our general (&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; or
&ldquo;diseased&rdquo;) evaluative perspective. It is not obvious,
however, that the passage must be read in this irrealist way. The
image of the diseased eye, e.g., seems to imply that some such
perspectives are wrong or distorted. And the insistence that
&ldquo;reasons and refutations&rdquo; are out of place in the context
of aesthetic disagreement might simply be a way of indicating that
they are dialectically <em>ineffective</em>, not that they are
conceptually inappropriate.</p>

<p>
However one resolves these various unclarities, the important point is
that Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea for a &ldquo;physiology of
aesthetics&rdquo; may be about looking at art from a diagnostic
perspective, rather than investigating its evolutionary origins
(though, of course, it is also possible that it be both; see Moore
2002 (165&ndash;92) for an interpretation along these lines). Now,
much of Nietzsche&rsquo;s language here&mdash;which calls to mind
19<sup>th</sup>-century &ldquo;degeneration theory&rdquo; and its
connections with racism, misogyny, and eugenics&mdash;is rather ugly.
One might wonder how literally he intends such talk&mdash;whether he
really believes, e.g., that Wagner&rsquo;s art is the product of some
physiological malady, or whether the notions of health and sickness
are being used more metaphorically. The latter option is bound to seem
more attractive to contemporary readers, though it should be borne in
mind that degeneration theories enjoyed wide acceptance in
Nietzsche&rsquo;s day, and he may well have taken them seriously in a
way that we cannot. Discussing this issue in any depth would take us
far beyond the ambit of this entry. But, it bears mentioning that
Nietzsche, atypically for a nineteenth-century degeneration theorist,
often does not treat degeneration as unqualifiedly bad (Gemes 2021).
He will even suggest, paradoxically, that &ldquo;sickness itself can
be a stimulus to life&rdquo; (<em>CW</em> 5).</p>

<h2 id="NieLatTheTra">6. Nietzsche&rsquo;s Later Theory of Tragedy</h2>

<p>
Nietzsche never treated tragedy (or any specific artform, for that
matter) in as much depth as he treated it in <em>The Birth of
Tragedy</em>. Yet, in his mature writings, he would continue to style
himself &ldquo;the first tragic philosopher&rdquo; (<em>EH</em>
&ldquo;Books&rdquo; BT:3), and to suggest that we need a tragic
outlook on life (<em>GS</em> 370; cf. <em>GS</em> 1, <em>EH</em>
&ldquo;Books&rdquo; BT:4). Nietzsche&rsquo;s name remains to a certain
degree inextricable from the philosophy of tragedy, given his landmark
contribution to this field. It is thus worth asking how, if at all,
his position evolved since his first book. We may approach this
question by considering Nietzsche&rsquo;s developing views on the
pleasure and value of tragedy. These issues are, of course, distinct.
The former question is why we evidently take pleasure in the
experience of intrinsically unpleasant emotions (pity, fear, etc.).
There may be reasons why tragedy is valuable other than that it causes
pleasure, and the reasons for valuing it might not be the same as the
reasons it is pleasurable. Nevertheless, it is natural to expect that
these two issues would be intimately related, so we shall consider
them together.</p>

<p>
In <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, answers to both questions were
apparently rooted in the idea that tragedy provides an
&ldquo;aesthetic justification&rdquo; of life and a
&ldquo;metaphysical solace&rdquo; (see &sect;2.3 above). Tragedy is
valuable because it gives us (or gave the Greeks, at least) an
adequate way of confronting the suffering of life, or a way of
conferring meaning on life, or both. Nietzsche&rsquo;s attempt to
resolve the famous paradox of tragic pleasure here is somewhat more
obscure. But, it is plausible to think that&mdash;like Schiller,
Schlegel, Schopenhauer, and others&mdash;he means to appeal to the
notion of the sublime (see <em>BT</em> 7/KSA 1:57), understood as
involving the realization or feeling that there is something in us
that transcends the boundaries of empirical reality (see Young 2013,
178&ndash;182 for discussion). Alternatively, the suggestion is that
&ldquo;the pleasure produced by the tragic myth has the same home as
the pleasurable sensation of dissonance in music&rdquo; (<em>BT</em>
24/KSA 1:152). The idea would appear to be that tragic pleasure lies
in the realization or feeling that our suffering is an integral part
of a wider aesthetic whole (Raymond 2014, 71; Hassan 2022, 126). It is
natural to suspect that Nietzsche would soon have come to abandon
these answers, appealing as they do to a speculative metaphysics.</p>

<p>
This suspicion would appear to find confirmation in Nietzsche&rsquo;s
subsequent remarks about tragedy. In <em>The Gay Science</em>, for
example, he offers a far more reductive account of the pleasure in
tragedy&mdash;or at least of the pleasure the Greeks took in
it&mdash;in terms simply of hearing &ldquo;good speeches&rdquo;
(<em>GS</em> 80). The explanation resembles Hume&rsquo;s suggestion
that tragic pleasure &ldquo;proceeds from that very eloquence, with
which the melancholy scene is represented&rdquo; (1757, 190&ndash;91),
albeit without Hume&rsquo;s further suggestion that painful emotions
thereby undergo a kind of &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo; In fact, Nietzsche
here denies that negative emotions&mdash;pity and fear&mdash;are part
of the proper response to tragedy at all. Arguably, this account
solves the problem of tragic pleasure only at the expense of denying
what might seem an obvious fact: that the experience of tragedy is
hedonically &ldquo;ambivalent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> (<em>BGE</em> 229) and the
<em>Genealogy</em> (<em>GM</em> II.7), Nietzsche offers a slightly
different account. He suggests that &ldquo;that which constitutes the
painful voluptuousness of tragedy is cruelty&rdquo; (<em>BGE</em>
229). The most straightforward way to understand this claim is that
the pleasure we get from witnessing the suffering of the tragic hero
is a kind of Schadenfreude. This would explain the pleasure in
tragedy, though it does not address what most philosophers have found
perplexing about it&mdash;the fact that we seem to enjoy the
intrinsically unpleasant emotions (e.g. pity) it provokes. Moreover,
it seems plainly inadequate from a phenomenological perspective.
Typically, a well-written tragedy makes us identify with and feel for
the <em>hero</em>, not her tormentors. A different reading, which
addresses these concerns, sees Nietzsche as attempting to explain
tragic pleasure as a peculiar form of sadomasochism. At this stage of
his career, Nietzsche holds that a fundamental feature of human
psychology is a tendency to take pleasure is causing suffering,
including causing <em>ourselves</em> to suffer. In engaging with the
painful experience of tragedy, then, one takes pleasure &ldquo;in
one&rsquo;s own making-oneself-suffer&rdquo; (<em>BGE</em> 229). This
explanation also seems problematic in at least a couple of ways. For
one, even if we agree with Nietzsche&rsquo;s account of the pleasure
of self-directed cruelty, it is unclear why tragic pleasure should
count as such an instance. If the point is that in watching a tragedy
we willingly undergo an experience that we know will be painful, then
it may be noted that there are many such cases which are neither
pleasurable nor instances of self-cruelty (e.g., going to the dentist).
A second problem arises from the fact that Nietzsche apparently still
wants to deny that pity is a genuine response to tragedy;
&ldquo;tragic pity&rdquo; is merely one of the many &ldquo;inoffensive
names&rdquo; we use to morally sanitize our enjoyment of cruelty
(<em>GM</em> II.7). But, if that is right, then it is unclear why the
experience of tragedy is painful to begin with, since the pain is
usually thought to be rooted precisely in the experience of emotions
like pity.</p>

<p>
In the works written between 1878 and 1887, the impression is strong
that Nietzsche is experimenting with various accounts (cf.,
<em>HH</em> I.103, 166, <em>D</em> 172) of tragic experience without
having settled on a considered, developed view (though, see Prince
1998 and Kirwin 2023 for contrasting assessments). Noteworthy too is
the fact that in this period Nietzsche makes few claims for the
positive value tragedy. Matters change somewhat dramatically in the
works of his final productive year, especially <em>Twilight of the
Idols</em>. Here, Nietzsche devotes much more sustained attention to
the tragic artform and is once again keen to insist on its central
importance to his ethical outlook. One question that arises in this
connection is whether this renewed focus on tragedy also brings with
it a return to <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s substantive doctrines. Young
(1992, 136&ndash;39) and Ridley (2007, 126&ndash;27; 2019), in
particular, have argued that it does. Consider, for example, the
following suggestive, but characteristically gnomic, passage:</p>

<blockquote>
Tragedy is so far from proving something about the Hellenes&rsquo;
pessimism in Schopenhauer&rsquo;s sense, that it must rather count as
its most decisive refutation and <em>counter instance</em>. Saying Yes
to life itself even in its strangest and most difficult problems; the
will to life rejoicing of its own inexhaustibility in the
<em>sacrifice</em> of its highest types&mdash;<em>that</em> is what I
called Dionysian, <em>that</em> is what I guessed to be the bridge to
the psychology of the <em>tragic</em> poet. <em>Not</em> to be freed
of terror and pity, not to purify oneself of a dangerous affect by
means of its vehement discharge&mdash;this is how Aristotle understood
it&mdash;: but rather, beyond terror and pity, <em>to</em> <em>be</em>
the eternal pleasure of becoming <em>itself</em>,&mdash;that pleasure
which also includes the <em>pleasure in annihilation</em>&hellip; And
with this I touch again on that point from which I once
began&mdash;the <em>Birth of Tragedy</em> was my first revaluation of
values. (<em>TI</em> &ldquo;Ancients&rdquo; 5)
</blockquote>

<p>
What is especially surprising here is not Nietzsche&rsquo;s continued
adherence to the Dionysian affirmation of life even at its
&ldquo;strangest and most difficult,&rdquo; but his apparent reprisal
of the idea that such affirmation involves identifying (if only
imaginatively) with an inexhaustible &ldquo;will to life&rdquo; that
takes pleasure in sacrificing its creatures. It is difficult, here,
not to hear echoes of <em>The Birth</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;primordial
unity&rdquo; or &ldquo;world-artist.&rdquo; What this seems to
indicate is that Nietzsche has returned to the idea that tragic
experience involves transcending one&rsquo;s individual existence and
identifying with a kind of suprapersonal being&mdash;one is supposed
to somehow &ldquo;<em>be</em> the eternal pleasure of becoming
<em>itself</em>&rdquo;&mdash;or, at least, that it involves the
<em>feeling</em> of such transcendence and identification.</p>

<p>
While a reasonable conclusion to draw from the above passage taken in
isolation, this suggestion is surprising, given the later
Nietzsche&rsquo;s clear opposition to Schopenhauer&rsquo;s metaphysics
and his ideal of self-transcendence. Those wishing to resist this
conclusion might note that the passage concludes a chapter entitled
&ldquo;What I Owe to the Ancients,&rdquo; in which Nietzsche attempts
to summarize the influence that his studies of antiquity have had on
his broader thought. It is possible that he here intends only to be
recalling rather than reasserting the position of <em>The Birth of
Tragedy</em>, and to be emphasizing that some elements of his later
thought&mdash;his opposition to Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism, his
view that life must be affirmed in spite of its &ldquo;terror and
absurdity&rdquo;&mdash;were already nascent there. There are
difficulties that such a reading would need to meet (see Ridley 2019,
321&ndash;22), but the impression that the above passage does not
exactly capture Nietzsche&rsquo;s mature view is reinforced by the
fact that he elsewhere presents an apparently quite different
conception of tragedy:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>What does the tragic artist communicate of himself?</em> Is it not
precisely the condition <em>without</em> fear in the face of the
fearsome and questionable that he shows? &hellip; The courage and
freedom of feeling before a powerful enemy, before a sublime
catastrophe, before a problem that arouses dread&mdash;this
<em>triumphant</em> condition is what the tragic artist selects, what
he glorifies. Before tragedy what is warlike in our soul celebrates
its saturnalia; he who is used to suffering, who seeks out suffering,
the <em>heroic</em> man, extols his own existence with tragedy.
(<em>TI</em> &ldquo;Skirmishes&rdquo; 24)
</blockquote>

<p>
A different reading, which draws on these comments, is developed in
Reginster 2014. Recall Reginster&rsquo;s functional account of
aesthetic value (see &sect;4)&mdash;to find something beautiful is to
be spurred by it to further creative activity. Reginster&rsquo;s
application of this general view to the case of tragedy builds on his
influential reading of the will to power as the overcoming of
resistances (2006). To will power is to will the overcoming of
resistances, and this inevitably brings suffering along with it. Yet,
it is also a requirement of great achievements, which often, if not
always, require meeting great <em>challenges</em>. Instead of showing
us suffering as a reason for withdrawing or turning away from life,
the tragic artist invites us to &ldquo;respond to &lsquo;the
terrifying and the questionable&rsquo; in our existence as he
does&mdash;as so many challenges, calls to adventure, or opportunities
for overcoming&rdquo; (2014, 34). This reading has the advantage of
not relying on a supraindividual perspective Nietzsche gives us reason
to reject, and of connecting his later thoughts on tragedy with his
other major philosophical preoccupations (power, self-overcoming,
etc.). It does, however, raise further questions about the adequacy of
Nietzsche&rsquo;s position. To say that all achievement requires
suffering, in the form of overcoming resistance, is not to say that
all suffering also constitutes an occasion for great achievement. Some
suffering might be purely and utterly destructive. And, indeed, one
might have supposed that the sorts of suffering encountered by tragic
heroes are often and paradigmatically of that sort&mdash;calamities
that come entirely unbidden, undeserved, and by which the hero
together with their <em>achievements</em> are undone. One may think
here of Oedipus&rsquo; exile from Thebes, which plunges the city he
once saved into civil war and leads to the death of three of his
children. This was a fact that Nietzsche himself had been particularly
keen to emphasize early on (KGA II.3, 7&ndash;10), but of which he
would now apparently have lost sight.</p>

<p>
It is difficult not to conclude that, despite his lifelong engagement
with the topic, Nietzsche never arrived at a fully satisfactory theory
of tragedy, let alone one that he was able to clearly articulate. This
is not to devalue his achievements here. Perhaps no philosopher has
done as much to emphasize that an understanding of tragedy must be
rooted in an understanding of the historical and cultural institutions
of the ancient world from which it emerged. Few have seen as keenly
the ways in which the tragic resists explanation in terms of
traditional moral categories. And even fewer have tried so forcefully
to articulate something which many seem inchoately to feel&mdash;that
tragedy contains the answers to our most profound existential
questions. Nietzsche&rsquo;s thoughts here can at times seem muddled,
even quixotic. But they are deep thoughts, and ones which merit
serious philosophical consideration.</p>
