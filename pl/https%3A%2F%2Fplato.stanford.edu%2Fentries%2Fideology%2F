<h1>Ideology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Mar 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The uses of the word &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; are so divergent as to
make it doubtful that there is any conceptual unity to the term. It
may refer to a comprehensive worldview, a legitimating discourse, a
partisan political doctrine, culture, false beliefs that help support
illegitimate power, beliefs that reinforce group identity, or
mystification. It is often used pejoratively, but just as often it is
a purely descriptive term. When authors criticize ideology, they may
be criticizing complicity with injustice, confirmation bias,
illusions, self-serving justifications, or dogmatism. When authors
identify ideology, they may locate it in forms of consciousness,
propositional attitudes, culture, institutions, discourses, social
conventions, or material rituals. As a consequence of this
multidimensional heterogeneity, debates about ideology shift and move
without apparently advancing.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, nearly all current uses pertain to <em>partiality</em>
(preference or bias), <em>partisanship</em> (adherence to a faction or
cause), or both. Scholarship and debate is driven by divergent
intuitions (often unacknowledged or misidentified) over such issues
as: whether to emphasize partiality (which is generally unintentional
or unconscious, and emerges spontaneously from a person&rsquo;s local
situatedness) or partisanship (which is political or value-laden, and
can be a conscious construction); the extent of the phenomenon or of
its salience; whether it is primarily cognitive or noncognitive; how
to characterize the impartial or nonpartisan condition to which
ideology is frequently contrasted; whether and to what extent ideology
is avoidable; whether and to what extent ideology is problematic or
pathological; and, of course, whether, to what extent, and by what
mechanisms ideology is causally responsible for the maintenance of
unjust or oppressive social conditions. </p>

<p>
The present entry distinguishes the major traditions or schools of
thinking about ideology and identifies the underlying epistemological,
moral, and political disagreements that motivate divergences in how
&ldquo;ideology&rdquo; is used. It clarifies the criteria according to
which authors impute one or another meaning to &ldquo;ideology&rdquo;
and maps the field of possible theories of ideology. Finally, it
indicates the major issues confronting critical theories of
ideology.</p>

<h2 id="TraIdeThe">1. Traditions of Ideology Theory</h2>

<p>
Although ideology has come to be inextricably tied to Marxism and
critical theory, liberal and conservative traditions of thinking about
ideology predate Marxist theorizations and set the terms on which the
term was integrated into Marxist theory. </p>

<p>
The term is attested as far back as the seventeenth century, but its
coinage is usually attributed to Antoine Louis Claude Destutt, compte
de Tracy (1754&ndash;1836), one of the scholars affiliated with the
Institut de France. Destutt de Tracy used the term to name a science
of ideas. Like many other <span class="nw">&ldquo;-ology&rdquo;</span>
terms&mdash;biology, pathology, mythology, and methodology are
prominent examples&mdash;the term&rsquo;s meaning in common speech has
migrated such that it generally names the <em>object</em> of the study
of ideas, rather than the study itself. In the case of ideology, this
migration was prepared by the reflexive and pedagogical nature of
Destutt de Tracy&rsquo;s science, which had to both account for itself
as a set of ideas and enact a process of intervening in the world of
ideas so as to reform the ideas of its audience. </p>

<p>
This established &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; as a term akin to
&ldquo;Enlightenment&rdquo;, and traditions of theorizing ideology can
be distinguished according to the broad schools of response to the
political, economic, and pedagogical projects of the Enlightenment.
Liberal theorists of ideology have focused on the dangers of
passionate or unacknowledged partiality and partisanship on the moral,
political, and scientific projects by which Enlightenment might be
advanced. Conservative and counter-Enlightenment thinkers, by
contrast, have focused on the moral and political risks of rationalism
and idealism, and have adopted &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; as a pejorative
name for purposeful efforts to reform traditions, beliefs, and
practices.</p>

<p>
Marxism, which has produced the most extensive and varied tradition of
ideology theory, has alternated between a debunking approach to
Enlightenment projects and a militant embrace of radical versions of
them. In the debunking mode, Marxists try to show that Enlightenment
projects, and the ideologies in which they are expressed, are merely
attractive excuses for or mystifications of social domination and
violence. In the radicalizing mode, Marxists argue, instead, that the
aims of Enlightenment cannot be achieved by Enlightenment methods, and
that projects of economic and political transformation must take
precedence over &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; projects of changing
people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>
Understanding these traditions of thinking about ideology is required
to make sense of the contemporary field of study, in which elements of
this history are constantly, if inconsistently, mobilized.</p>

<h3 id="LibConIde">1.1 Liberal Conceptions of Ideology</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Ideology&rdquo; originated as part of the liberal project of
social reform via education. Destutt de Tracy&rsquo;s works on the
moral and political sciences, written as part of his activities at the
Institut, were published as <em>Elements of Ideology</em>
(1801&ndash;15). In the <em>Elements</em>, Destutt de Tracy derived
from empiricist epistemological premises a canon of probabilistic
reasoning, a sentimentalist moral theory, and a liberal political
economy. The work summarized programmatically the hopes for a secular
and rationalist educational system that Destutt de
Tracy&mdash;together with Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis
(1757&ndash;1808) and other allies in the French Senate&mdash;tried to
realize under the Directory and then the Consulate.</p>

<p>
The aim of ideology was &ldquo;to place the moral and political
sciences on their true basis, a knowledge of our intellectual
faculties&rdquo; (Destutt de Tracy 1817 [2011: 10]). Given that every
perception is, &ldquo;taken each separately, and in itself&rdquo;,
true, Destutt de Tracy traced all error to the will, which
&ldquo;denaturalizes&rdquo; our original perceptions (1817 [2011: 34,
36]). The will or desire, our faculty of preference, leads us into
error by inducing us to see what we want to see and to discount what
is inconvenient to recognize. </p>

<p>
For this reason, ideology can help us by teaching us how &ldquo;to
analyze our sentiments&rdquo; and to distinguish between those that
&ldquo;direct us well&rdquo; and those that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
form within us a false and blind consciousness [<em>une fausse et
aveugle conscience</em>], which always removes us further from the
road of reason, the only one leading to happiness. (1817 [2011: 255];
1815 [2015: 254]) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, despite the later identification of the two terms, Destutt
de Tracy conceived ideology as a remedy for false consciousness. </p>

<p>
This basic orientation has continued to characterize liberal
approaches to ideology. Liberal education in its modern form aims to
counteract the human tendencies to defer to authority, to succumb to
peer pressure, and to exploit perceived inequalities of status
(Nussbaum 2009: 9). It pursues this aim by teaching critical thinking,
an appreciation for scientific methods, and a standard of
reasonableness. Extremism, moral absolutism, and confirmation bias are
thought to be inimical to liberal society, and a broad tradition of
social scientific and social theoretical research, as well as
political philosophical reflection, has grown up around the study and
management of these problems (see, e.g., Putnam 1971). </p>

<p>
The continuity between this work and that of the
<em>id&eacute;ologues</em> has been obscured by the fact that
&ldquo;ideology&rdquo; has come to name the danger to be overcome or
managed by liberal education rather than the intellectual project of
overcoming or managing that danger. Thus, the end-of-ideology thesis
expressed the hope that &ldquo;civil politics could replace
ideological politics&rdquo; (Bell 1988: 138), but such a civil
politics was also the aim of ideology for Destutt de Tracy, Cabanis,
and company. </p>

<p>
Within the liberal tradition, some have distinguished
&ldquo;ideologies&rdquo;&mdash;understood as inherently unreasonable
intellectual visions for ordering human affairs (Arendt 1953; Bell
1960 [1962])&mdash;from religious and ethical traditions and
worldviews more generally. Others consider all &ldquo;comprehensive
doctrines&rdquo; together, allowing that there might be reasonable or
unreasonable adherents of any given doctrine (Rawls 2005). </p>

<p>
Another division among liberal approaches emerges from the practical
and political question of how liberal polities and institutions ought
to respond to unreasonable ideologies. For public reason liberals,
policy must be susceptible to public justification&mdash;i.e.,
justification in terms acceptable to all&mdash;in order to be
legitimate (Gaus 1996, 2011; Rawls 2005). This might be understood as
requiring a language of political justification that is neutral among
all comprehensive doctrines or ideologies. In practice, this approach
leans in the direction of strong universalism in legislation and a
reliance on markets and market-like incentives as the predominant
socializing or civilizing mechanisms. However, some liberals believe
this is insufficient to protect the political sphere from capture by
illiberal forces, and advocate instead a program of civic education
and/or &ldquo;militant&rdquo; measures like establishing <em>cordons
sanitaires</em> to prevent dangerous ideologies and illiberal parties
from corrupting the public sphere (Castiglione &amp; McKinnon 2003;
Gauthier 1977). </p>

<h3 id="ConConIde">1.2 Conservative Conceptions of Ideology</h3>

<p>
The conservative tradition of thinking about ideology has not been so
affected by the historical transformations in the meaning of the term.
The conservative objection to ideology has remained very close to the
attacks leveled by Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&ndash;1821) against the
<em>id&eacute;ologues</em> after 1801. Bonaparte, for political
reasons, appealed to the Catholic faithful by attacking the
<em>id&eacute;ologues</em> for their rationalism and materialism.
Ideology, according to Bonaparte&mdash;influenced in this regard by
the Romanticism of Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute;, vicomte de
Chateaubriand (1768&ndash;1848)&mdash;sought to replace Christian
tradition and mores with a rational system of belief and legislation,
ordering social and political life by means of the human mind (Kennedy
1979: 358&ndash;60). </p>

<p>
Ideology, on this account, retains its particular connection to the
Enlightenment and is understood to encompass any political project of
social or political reform guided by a rational or abstract doctrine.
Hume&rsquo;s objection to &ldquo;parties of principle&rdquo; is a
recognizable precedent (Hume 1777 [1994]). The conservative approach
to ideology expresses a skepticism about modern rationalism
(understood as encompassing empiricism and scientific methods
generally), especially insofar as rationalism is applied to social and
political life (Oakeshott 1962 [1991]). </p>

<p>
Conservative thinkers tend to identify rationalist or ideological
politics with social engineering, or the illegitimate
&ldquo;assimilation of politics to engineering&rdquo; (Oakeshott 1962
[1991: 9]). Opposition to social engineering (AKA
&ldquo;scientism&rdquo;, &ldquo;positivism&rdquo;, or &ldquo;high
modernism&rdquo;) also characterizes liberalism and critical theory
(Habermas 1981 [1987]; Hayek 1952; Horkheimer 1968 [1982]; Popper
1944&ndash;45 [2002]; Scott 1998). However, conservative thinkers
often identify <em>any</em> political appeal to scientific or social
scientific knowledge&mdash;including that of economics&mdash;as social
engineering, refusing the liberal distinction between
&ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo; and &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; engineering, or
between &ldquo;the practical management of problems&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the clash of ideologies&rdquo;. Hence, Oakeshott claimed that
Hayek&rsquo;s <em>Road to Serfdom</em> amounted to &ldquo;a plan to
resist all planning&rdquo;, thereby converting resistance to
rationalism &ldquo;into an ideology&rdquo; (Oakeshott 1962 [1991:
26]). Hence, also, many contemporary conservatives focus on
&ldquo;social constructivism&rdquo; and &ldquo;gender ideology&rdquo;
as attempts to make over putatively immutable or natural facts,
accessible by &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;, as mind-dependent matters
for human decision.</p>

<p>
However, the conservative critique of ideology is not reducible to
antirationalism. According to the conservative account, ideologies are
themselves abstracts or abridgments of practical experience. While
ideologies present themselves as premeditated principles that can
guide and evaluate human activity, they actually simplify, schematize,
or rationalize previous activity. This can be appropriate. Like digest
books, ideologies provide an easily assimilable form of knowledge.
This is useful when &ldquo;new and politically inexperienced social
classes &hellip; have risen to the exercise of political initiative
and authority&rdquo; (Oakeshott 1962 [1991, 30]). Ideology becomes
essentially inimical to good politics, however, when it derives, not
from political experience, but from some other realm of human
activity&mdash;&ldquo;war, religion, or the conduct of industry, for
example&rdquo; (Oakeshott 1962 [1991: 54]).</p>

<p>
This concern with the colonization of the lifeworld of politics by
alien vocabularies and logics of belief is not confined to
conservatives (Luk&aacute;cs 1923 [1971]; Arendt 1958; Habermas 1981
[1987]), but it is distinctive of the conservative tradition to
identify this concern with the critique of ideology.</p>

<h3 id="MarConIde">1.3 Marxist Conceptions of Ideology</h3>

<p>
The Marxist tradition has always been torn between two approaches to
ideology in the original liberal sense. On the one hand, Marxists have
been drawn to a radicalizing strategy, which endorses the aims of
liberal Enlightenment but disputes the pedagogical, economic, and
civil means endorsed by liberals. On the other hand, however, Marxists
have also pursued a debunking strategy by which they aim to unmask the
ideological project as either a ruse of power or as a form of
mystification. Since the meaning of &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; has
drifted, these critical strategies have drifted as well, proliferating
Marxist and post-Marxist critical theoretical accounts of ideology.
Because philosophical discussion of ideology very often begins from
claims associated with the Marxist tradition, the multitude of Marxist
accounts of ideology has been a major source of both diversity and
confusion in the philosophical literature on the topic. </p>

<h4 id="IdeMarEng">1.3.1 Ideology in Marx and Engels</h4>

<p>
Karl Marx (1818&ndash;1883) read and took notes on Destutt de
Tracy&rsquo;s <em>Elements of Ideology</em>, both in 1844 and again in
preparation for writing <em>Capital</em>. To a first approximation,
the <em>id&eacute;ologues&rsquo;</em> project was always the exemplary
case of ideology for Marx, but he also identified the writings of
Young Hegelians like Bruno Bauer (1809&ndash;1882) and Max Stirner
(Johann Kaspar Schmitt, 1806&ndash;1856) as instances of a
&ldquo;German ideology&rdquo;, and generalized the model further to
encompass at least significant aspects of political economy, law,
politics, religion, philosophy, journalism, and the military (Marx
&amp; Engels 1846 [2017: I/5.120]; Marx 1867 [2024: 409]). </p>

<p>
What unites this disparate and capacious catalog of ideologies and
ideologists, for Marx, is the &ldquo;unproductive&rdquo; or
&ldquo;immaterial&rdquo; nature of their activity (Mills 1992).
According to Marx, the development of the social division of labor and
the exploitation of the growing productive powers of labor establishes
a basis upon which rests &ldquo;the state and the rest of the
idealistic superstructure&rdquo; (Marx &amp; Engels 1846 [2017:
I/5.115]). The people who occupy themselves with the business of this
superstructure are, by dint of &ldquo;their practical position in
life, their business, and the division of labor&rdquo;, prone to the
&ldquo;illusion&rdquo; that they are independent and directive of
society (Marx &amp; Engels 1846 [2017: I/5.66]). This is supposed to
be a sociologically materialist explanation of why ideologists like
Destutt de Tracy, Bauer, and Stirner try to instruct and direct
society according to ideas. &ldquo;Ideology&rdquo;, therefore, comes
to name, for Marx, both the &ldquo;sociological idealism&rdquo; to
which superstructural workers are susceptible and the superstructure
itself, which explains their susceptibility (Mills 1992).</p>

<p>
In his later work&mdash;especially in his <em>Ludwig Feuerbach and the
End of Classical German Philosophy</em> (1886)&mdash;Friedrich Engels
(1820&ndash;1895) returns to this sociological explanation of
ideology, emphasizing Marxism&rsquo;s opposition to philosophical
idealism. According to Engels, ideology entails an &ldquo;occupation
with thoughts as with independent entities, developing independently
and subject only to their own laws&rdquo;. However, it is actually
&ldquo;the material life conditions&rdquo; of the ideologist that
determines, &ldquo;in the final analysis&rdquo;, the course of this
development of thought (Engels 1886 [2003: 26.394]). The ideologist,
as an idealist, is necessarily ignorant of the economic determinants
of their thought process. Hence, the ideologist, as Engels put it in a
letter, accomplishes a conscious process of thinking with a
&ldquo;false consciousness&rdquo;, since their consciousness
attributes to the immanent development of ideas what is actually a
reflection or effect of the development of material life (Engels 1893
[2004: 50.164]). </p>

<p>
Because Marx and Engels never developed an explicit theory of
ideology, later scholars have attempted to do so by connecting Marx
and Engels&rsquo;s scattered comments about ideology with three other
topics in their writings. </p>

<p>
Most prominently, their critique of ideology is but one instance in
which they seek to give a sociologically materialist explanation of
ideas or consciousness, and this has led many to assimilate their
account of ideology and their theory of ideas or consciousness (Cohen
1978 [2001: 376]; McCarney 1980; Torrance 1995). On this approach, the
question of ideology is the question of the social determination of
ideas or of forms of consciousness (Mannheim 1929 [1936]), and, since
Marx and Engels identify classes and class struggle as the fundamental
social determinant, their theory of ideology is taken to be their
account of how forms of consciousness arise out of and/or serve class
interests (McCarney 1980: chap. 1).</p>

<p>
However, Marx and Engels&rsquo;s comments about ideology have also
been attached to their claim that &ldquo;the thoughts of the dominant
class are in every epoch the dominant thoughts&rdquo; (Marx &amp;
Engels 1846 [2017: I/5.60]). This has given rise to the
&ldquo;dominant ideology thesis&rdquo;, according to which, in any
(stable) class society, the ruling class formulates (perhaps
unintentionally or unconsciously) a set of beliefs that reflect and/or
serve their own class interest in continued domination and
exploitation, ideas which are largely adopted by the subordinate
classes, thereby explaining their continued subordination
(Abercrombie, Hill, &amp; Turner 1980; Weber 1921/22 [1954: 336]).
While this may appear to be a specification of the identification of
ideology with partisan class ideas, it cannot be true that ideology
refers both to partisan class ideas in general and to the
&ldquo;ruling ideas&rdquo; in particular (Abercrombie &amp; Turner
1978: 251). The &ldquo;class ideas&rdquo; approach gives rise to an
evaluatively neutral account of ideologies, while the &ldquo;ruling
ideas&rdquo; approach inclines towards a pejorative or critical
account of ideology as a bulwark of domination and exploitation.</p>

<p>
Finally, some have taken Marx&rsquo;s discussion in <em>Capital</em>
of fetishism to be an extension or development of his account of
ideology (Eagleton 1991: 84&ndash;88; Geras 1971; Louette 2023; Mepham
1972). On this account, capitalist society, because of the
market-imposed separation between production and consumption,
necessarily appears to its participants as a mysterious entity
operating according to occult mechanisms, a socially produced
mystification that should properly identified as ideology. It has been
noted, however, that Marx never refers to fetishism as ideology, and
that the handful of appearances of the word in <em>Capital</em> refer
to the activity of superstructural workers in general and political
economists in particular (Balibar 1994: 89; Mills 1992; Roberts 2024).
Nonetheless, this has been an important strand of ideology theory in
the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and it does reconnect the
concept of ideology to the specifically modern and liberal domain from
which it originally emerged, insofar as fetishism is proper to
commercial modernity.</p>

<h4 id="IdeMarTra">1.3.2 Ideology in the Marxist Tradition</h4>

<p>
Because Marxism developed as a party idea among socialists prior to
the publication of the manuscripts on &ldquo;the German
ideology&rdquo; (see Johnson, 2022), Marxist partisans tended to use
&ldquo;ideology&rdquo;&mdash;in keeping with Marx&rsquo;s mention of
the term in the 1859 preface to <em>A Contribution to the Critique of
Political Economy</em>&mdash;to refer to the &ldquo;forms in which men
become conscious&rdquo; of the class contradiction in the economic
base of society &ldquo;and fight it out&rdquo; (Marx &amp; Engels 1859
[1987: 29.263]). Hence, ideology had both a theoretical aspect and a
political aspect. Theoretically, it was the form in which
socio-economic matters rose to conscious awareness. Politically, it
was the set of fighting creeds by which parties justified their
tactics and attempted to win supporters. </p>

<p>
Because the capitalist economy was taken to be defined by a tendency
of the class conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat to
sharpen and to increasingly determine everything else, many Marxists
followed Lenin in reading all ideologies through their intersection
with this fundamental conflict. This led to the simplifying assumption
that people face a binary choice, &ldquo;either bourgeois or socialist
ideology&rdquo; (Lenin 1902 [1973: 37]). Within a highly polarized
political context, this assumption led to the conclusion that
&ldquo;to belittle the socialist ideology in any way, to turn aside
from it in the slightest degree means to strengthen bourgeois
ideology&rdquo; (Lenin 1902 [1973: 37]). This, in turn, led to the
shorthand equation of &ldquo;socialist ideology&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., the
correct party line&mdash;with &ldquo;class consciousness&rdquo; and of
any ideological deviation from the correct line with &ldquo;false
consciousness&rdquo;. </p>

<p>
In the works of Hungarian Marxist philosopher Georg (Gy&ouml;rgy)
Luk&aacute;cs (1885&ndash;1971), the identification of the (long-term)
interests of the proletariat with the interests of humanity as such
develops this connection between (non-Marxist) ideologies and false
consciousness (Luk&aacute;cs 1923 [1971]; M&aacute;rkus 1981: 131).
This conceptual connection was crucial for the Frankfurt School of
critical theory, as well as for the broader tradition of Marxist
humanism (e.g., Thompson 1957: 107&ndash;9). For Luk&aacute;cs, and
even more so for members of the Frankfurt School, false consciousness
is not opposed to science&mdash;which, in the form of positivism, has
been part of the increasing dominance of rational calculation and
formal rationality characteristic of capitalist modernity&mdash;but to
a reflexive, normative, and critical theory (Geuss 1981). For this
critical theory, <em>negation</em> plays the special role of unmasking
the particular interests that animate and are served by any positive
project (including, especially, the party line pursued by Leninist
organizations) (Cook 2001). In this tradition, the critique of
ideology becomes tightly bound up or even identified with the critique
of alienation and reification. <em>Alienation</em> is the process
whereby the artifacts of human practices&mdash;e.g., the products of
labor, or the institutions of the labor movement&mdash;escape from the
control of and turn against their creators (James 2012; Mattick 1969).
<em>Reification</em> is the process whereby the relational totality
that constitutes society is obscured by its seemingly independent,
quantifiable, and non-relational parts (Luk&aacute;cs 1923 [1971]).
</p>

<p>
It is from this perspective that it makes sense to interpret
Marx&rsquo;s discussion of the fetishism of commodities as an
extension and development of the analysis of ideology into the
analysis of impersonal forms of social domination (Balibar 1994;
Postone 1993). It also makes sense to flesh out the discussion of
ideology either by reference to Hegel&rsquo;s criticisms of the
understanding as he opposes this operation of the mind to dialectical
reason (Abazari 2019), or by reference to Freud&rsquo;s analysis of
the processes of the unconscious, which allows critical theorists to
diagnose ideology as the substitute gratification of real needs (Fromm
1968: 63). </p>

<p>
In contrast to this line of development, another Marxist tradition of
thinking about ideology is represented by the work of the Italian
journalist and philosopher Antonio Gramsci (1891&ndash;1937). Gramsci,
emphasizing the texture of political conflict, developed the idea of
ideology as class consciousness into an account of culture and
institutions as the terrain of politics (Gramsci 1971). According to
Gramsci, a socialist party, in its efforts to establish leadership of
the working classes, articulates Marxist theory with other elements of
popular consciousness and popular culture. If this process is
successful, the party will advance to the head of a coalition of
different class forces (a &ldquo;historic bloc&rdquo;) and be
positioned to exercise hegemony over society as a whole. This line of
thinking leads away from the critique of ideology as false
consciousness and towards the descriptive analysis of the
(contradictory) elements and tendencies of cultural traditions and
institutions. </p>

<p>
Although this tradition has been developed primarily in histories of
popular culture (Guha 1983; Hobsbawm 1959 [1963]; Thompson 1963
[1968]), and in interdisciplinary cultural studies (Denning 2004; Hall
2016; Hall et al. 1978 [2013]), it has also received significant
philosophical elaboration, beginning especially with French
philosopher Louis Althusser (1918&ndash;1990). Althusser, like the
Frankfurt School of critical theory, associated ideology with the
reproduction of the social order and sought to use psychoanalytic
concepts, including that of the unconscious, to develop the theory of
ideology. However, he drew on the structuralist psychoanalysis of
Lacan to argue that ideology &ldquo;interpellates individuals as
subjects&rdquo; (Althusser 1995 [2014: 188]). What Althusser meant by
this formula is that ideology constitutes and calls to us as agents,
providing the framework and orientation within which we experience
ourselves (and one another) as centers of action beholden to normative
demands. According to Althusser, ideology can perform this function
only because it is always embedded in ritual practices and
institutions.</p>

<p>
Althusser also affirmed two other theses about ideology that sharply
differentiate his approach from that of the Frankfurt School. First,
because of its central function in subject-formation, ideology is not
a symptom of class struggle or a feature of human society that could
ever wither away, even in an ideal communist future, but is instead
&ldquo;a structure essential to the historical life of
societies&rdquo; (Althusser 1965 [1969: 232]). Hence, his approach is
not a critique of ideology as such, and &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; is not
a pejorative term for Althusser. Moreover, rather than opposing
ideology to a critical theory that is essentially reflexive and
normative, Althusser opposes ideology to science, understood as a
subject-less body of concepts that make possible the production of
knowledge within a specific domain (Lewis 2009 [2022]). </p>

<p>
Althusser&rsquo;s claim that ideology interpellates individuals as
subjects has been the most influential aspect of his theory. The
Swedish sociologist G&ouml;ran Therborn has developed it away from its
functionalist tendencies by stressing the irreducible plurality of
forms in which agents might &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; (both specified as
a particular type and authorized to act in that capacity) (Therborn
1980 [1999]). Judith Butler both drew upon Althusser&rsquo;s
understanding of subjectification in their account of the production
of gendered subjects and reacted against his account of
interpellation&mdash;in a manner broadly consonant with critical
theory&mdash;by emphasizing the ever-recurrent possibility of
de-subjectification (Butler 1997). Quill Kukla has argued that
Althusser provides an account of how subjects are inducted into the
normative &ldquo;space of reasons&rdquo; by being misrecognized as
already bound by the normative conventions into which they are being
recruited, an account that aligns Althusser with Sellars&rsquo;s
account of epistemic authority (Kukla 2000). Sally Haslanger has
directly taken up Althusser&rsquo;s argument for the material
existence of ideology in institutions and practices, a theme she has
developed in her account of &ldquo;cultural techn&#275;s&rdquo;
(Haslanger 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021). </p>

<h2 id="MapIde">2. Mapping Ideology</h2>

<p>
Due to the heterogeneity of the traditions of ideology theory, efforts
to mobilize the concept must begin by establishing the sense in which
the word is being understood. A first-cut specification is to
distinguish between evaluatively-neutral or descriptive conceptions
and evaluatively-critical or pejorative conceptions. (For critical
conceptions, one may then ask about the target of the criticism. What
is wrong with ideology? This question will be the focus of
 <a href="#VarIdeCri">Section 3</a>
 below.) A second specification, however, distinguishes the location
of ideology&mdash;what Shelby calls the &ldquo;unit of analysis&rdquo;
(2003) and Balkin calls the &ldquo;object of study&rdquo; (1998: 101).
Does &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; pick out a type of consciousness, a set of
ideas, the world of culture, a set of expectations, or something else?
Finally, there is the question of scope. Does ideology encompass all
ideas, for example, or only those ideas with a certain content, a
certain social function, a certain etiology, and/or a certain set of
effects?</p>

<p>
One must establish where a given conception of ideology fits in a
classificatory scheme of all possible conceptions in order to know how
it relates to any other conception. However, this classification,
while necessary, is less interesting than the considerations that lead
an author to classify ideology as they do in the first place. Authors
are rarely explicit about this, and a fully explanatory theory may not
be possible. However, two important variables can be established.
First, the valence of ideology tracks attitudes towards partiality and
partisanship. Critical conceptions of ideology indicate a commitment
to moral and/or epistemic impartiality, while descriptive conceptions
indicate greater openness to the moral and/or epistemic virtues of
partisanship. Meanwhile, intuitions about the location of ideology
track theories of agency. Adherents of the standard theory of agency
as rational-intentional action are drawn to cognitivism regarding
ideology (Elster 1983; Shelby 2003; Stanley 2015), while those who
downplay the role of representational mental states in agency, such as
enactment or embodiment theorists, will tend to locate ideology in
habitual schemas of meaning, cultural techn&#275;s, affects, or bodily
practices (Althusser 1995 [2014]; Hall 2016; Haslanger 2015; 2019;
Hennessy 1993; Jaeggi 2009; Therborn 1980 [1999]). </p>

<h3 id="ValIde">2.1 The Valence of Ideology</h3>

<p>
The most obvious divide in uses of &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; is between
uses with a pejorative or critical sense and uses with a neutral or
descriptive sense (Geuss 1981; Haslanger 2021; Shelby 2003). While a
positive or laudatory sense is also logically possible, only in the
case of the <em>id&eacute;ologues</em> could ideology in general be
positively valorized. As soon as the word became a common rather than
a proper noun&mdash;as soon as there were many ideologies rather than
only one&mdash;any attempt to positively valorize ideology used the
term in a descriptive sense while distinguishing between good and bad
instances on independent moral, political, or epistemic grounds
(contra Geuss 1981: 22&ndash;26). </p>

<p>
Although it is common to associate the Marxist tradition with the
critical conception (e.g., Shelby 2003: 156&ndash;57), critical and
descriptive conceptions are equally at home both within and outside of
Marxism. Marx and Engels deployed &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; critically,
but only because they found the strategy of the ideologists
ridiculous; their conception is descriptive, even if their use of the
term takes on pejorative color. Lenin, Gramsci, and Althusser all
developed descriptive concepts. Conservatives, liberals, and
non-Marxist socialists are similarly divided. </p>

<p>
Rather than broad political traditions, it is helpful to associate the
division between critical and descriptive valences with differing
commitments to epistemic and/or moral impartiality or universalism.
The tradition of Frankfurt School critical theory, which is closely
connected to the project of <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, is strongly
committed to both moral universalism and to a Hegel-influenced
epistemological claim that, at least for social phenomena, knowledge
can only be achieved from the perspective of the totality (Jay 1984).
From within this tradition, therefore, ideology appears essentially as
false (because partial) consciousness, which must be transcended
through criticism. For anyone committed, on the other hand, to the
notion that knowledge and/or right action can or must emerge from some
particular perspective or worldview, ideology appears as a necessary
medium. Intermediate positions are possible, too. For instance,
&ldquo;ideology&rdquo; may be reserved as a pejorative term for an
<em>excess</em> of partiality or partisanship, say, a
&ldquo;closed-system&rdquo; worldview that insulates the adherent
against novel or disconfirming experiences. </p>

<h3 id="LocIde">2.2 The Location of Ideology</h3>

<p>
A second variable in the study of ideology is where theorists look for
instances. Broadly speaking, theories of ideology are divided between
cognitivist and culturalist approaches. Cognitivist accounts locate
ideology among ideas, beliefs, &ldquo;forms of consciousness&rdquo;,
mental representations, or propositional attitudes (Elster 1983: chap.
IV; 1985: 459&ndash;65; Habermas 1981 [1987]; Mills 2005; Shelby 2003;
Stanley 2018). Culturalist accounts locate ideology among &ldquo;forms
of life&rdquo;, habits, practico-symbolic schemas, or &ldquo;cultural
techn&#275;s&rdquo; (Balkin 1998; Haslanger 2015, 2019, 2021; Jaeggi
2009, 2014 [2018]; Therborn 1980 [1999]). </p>

<p>
Among cognitivist accounts, some restrict ideology to &ldquo;beliefs
and values consciously entertained by some individual or
individuals&rdquo; (Elster 1985, 462). More commonly, however, it is
recognized that an ideology &ldquo;may be only implicit in the
behavioral dispositions, utterances, conduct, and practices of social
actors&rdquo;, and that ideological beliefs &ldquo;are quite
frequently confused and may be expressed only in the form of
stereotypes, clich&eacute;s, and fragmented narratives&rdquo; (Shelby
2003: 161). Cutting across this distinction between <em>explicit</em>
and <em>implicit</em> beliefs (Plamenatz 1970: 17) is the distinction
between <em>beliefs</em> and <em>values</em>&mdash;between beliefs
&ldquo;about the world as it is&rdquo; and beliefs &ldquo;about the
world as it ought to be&rdquo; (Elster 1985: 466)&mdash;as well as the
further distinction between beliefs about how something <em>can</em>
be done and beliefs about how something <em>ought</em> to be done
(Stanley 2015). These distinctions are often submerged in a more
generic cognitivist claim that, e.g., ideology consists of &ldquo;the
descriptive vocabulary&rdquo; or &ldquo;language of
consciousness&rdquo; appropriate to everyday social life (Fields
1990), or that &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; names &ldquo;partisan group
ideas&rdquo; (Mills 1992).</p>

<p>
Culturalist accounts of ideology are motivated by some of the same
observations that incline many cognitivists to include implicit
beliefs in the field of ideology. They go further, however, by
foregrounding &ldquo;&lsquo;non-discursive&rsquo;
elements,&rsquo;&rdquo; such as &ldquo;characteristic gestures,
rituals, attitudes, forms of artistic activity, etc.&rdquo; (Geuss
1981: 6); or else, they find ideology in &ldquo;manifestations of a
particular being-in-the-world of conscious actors&rdquo; (Therborn
1980 [1999: 2]); or, alternatively, they identify ideology as a
species of &ldquo;cultural techn&#275;&rdquo;, the &ldquo;network of
social meanings, tools, scripts, schemas, heuristics, principles, and
the like which we draw on in action, and which gives shape to our
practices&rdquo; (Haslanger 2017: 155). Regardless of the language
used, the intent is to locate ideology in the pre-reflective and
habitual dimensions of human agency and social life. </p>

<p>
Althusser might represent a third option, neither cognitivist nor
culturalist, since he seems to locate ideology in practices, rituals,
and &ldquo;apparatuses&rdquo; (or institutions), which are, according
to him, the material existence of ideas (Althusser 1995 [2014:
260&ndash;61]). Some would include Foucault (1975 [1995]) and Butler
(1997) in this lineage (Montag 2013; Lepold 2018). However,
cognitivists and culturalists are at pains to demonstrate that their
accounts of ideology are also both material and practical (e.g.,
Stanley 2018: 508&ndash;9; Haslanger 2018, 2022). More work would have
to be done to demonstrate that the Althusserian approach is genuinely
distinct in this regard.</p>

<p>
Whether a theorist is drawn to a cognitivist or a culturalist account
of ideology seems to depend on whether they adhere more closely to the
standard conception of agency as rational-intentional action or
incline more towards alternative conceptions of agency that emphasize
pre-reflective and embodied aspects of human action. </p>

<p>
This suggests a significant consensus underlying the more obvious
disagreements. Ideology shares basic features with human agency, and
to conceive of anything&mdash;a text, an idea, a convention, or a
cultural form&mdash;as ideology is to bring it into focus as either a
condition of or burden on human agency. When this regularity is
combined with the regularity noted above&mdash;that ideology denotes
partiality, &ldquo;in one of the two senses of that term, expressed in
French by &lsquo;partiel&rsquo; and &lsquo;partial&rsquo;&rdquo;
(Elster 1983: 145&ndash;46)&mdash;the disorder of ideology theory as a
field of study becomes intelligible as expressing the diversity of
theorists&rsquo; intuitions about the roles that partiality and
partisanship play (or should play) in human action. </p>

<h3 id="ScoIde">2.3 The Scope of Ideology</h3>

<p>
Regardless of disagreements over the valence and location of ideology,
most accounts agree that certain scope restrictions must be placed on
ideas or cultural elements in order for them to be rightly classed as
ideological. Ideology pertains to social life, in one manner or
another. Four types of social pertinence, in particular, are commonly
indicated. Most universally, ideology is held (1) to have social
<em>causes</em> and (2) to have social <em>effects</em>. These
stipulations are only scope restrictions for cognitivists, since all
culture, by definition, has social causes and effects. </p>

<p>
That ideology is &ldquo;explained by social facts&rdquo; (Elster 1985:
459) is uncontroversial, with disputation reserved for the questions
of which facts count as social facts and which social facts are
explanatory (Haslanger 2022). Not all cognitivists accept that
ideology has social effects, however. This is one reading of Marx and
Engels&rsquo;s original criticism of ideology: ideology is an effect
of the ideologists&rsquo; placement in the social division of labor,
but this placement also condemns ideology to inconsequence, since
ideologists have no access to or ability to affect the mode of
material production. </p>

<p>
More controversially, ideology is often thought (3) to have social
<em>content</em>, or to be about society. It is doubtful that culture,
as the culturalist ideology theorists intend it, has content or
about-ness in this sense. If it does, then it seems that culture
reduces to &ldquo;a network&rdquo; of beliefs and values (Shelby 2003:
159), with the consequences that (a) the culturalist approach to
ideology reduces to the cognitivist approach and (b) all culture is
&ldquo;about&rdquo; society, since it regulates and makes sense of
social practices. Therefore, this social content proviso is a scope
restriction that applies only to cognitivist accounts. However, again,
not all cognitivists accept this scope restriction. Theological and
metaphysical beliefs are classic objects of ideology critique, despite
lacking (explicit) social content (Forster 2015).</p>

<p>
Finally, ideology is frequently thought (4) to have a social
<em>function</em>. (This is usually the rationale for classing
theology and metaphysics as species of ideology.) What this function
might be varies. For many Marxists, &ldquo;part of what makes a form
of social consciousness ideological is the role it plays in
establishing or reinforcing relations of oppression&rdquo; (Shelby
2003: 173; compare to Forster 2015: 817; Freeland 2000: 368; King
1991). For Althusser, however, ideology has no special connection to
oppression or exploitation; instead, &ldquo;all ideology has the
function (which defines it) of &lsquo;constituting&rsquo; concrete
individuals as subjects&rdquo; (Althusser 1995 [2014: 262]). The
attribution of functions is controversial, since it goes beyond the
identification of predictable social effects to claim that an ideology
exists or has the characteristics it has <em>because</em> of its
predictable social effects. To escape backwards causation, any
function attribution must, to be complete, identify a causal feedback
or selection mechanism, either intentional or systematic but
unintentional, whereby ideologies that successfully fulfill their
social function come into being, propagate, and are resilient, while
those that do not are never produced, are winnowed out, or fade away.
The debate on the appropriateness of functional explanation in social
theory, and in the theory of ideology especially, is long-standing and
complex (important entries in the debate include: Carling 2002; Cohen
1978 [2001]; Elster 1985, 1986; Pettit 1996b; Rosen 1996; Wood 1986).
Nonetheless, using a social function to restrict the scope of
ideational or cultural phenomena to be captured by the theory of
ideology remains common (Haslanger 2019; Shelby 2003). </p>

<h2 id="VarIdeCri">3. Varieties of Ideology Critique</h2>

<p>
Ideology can be criticized along three lines. It might be criticized
for exhibiting or leading to faults of rationality, or for being
interest-undermining. It might also be criticized for exhibiting or
leading to faults of morality, or for being justice-undermining.
Finally, it might be criticized for exhibiting or leading to epistemic
faults, or for being knowledge-undermining. Each of these criticisms
might be either unconditional or conditional. For example, one
ideology critic might dismiss all ideology as interest-undermining
partisanship, while another might differentiate between
interest-serving and interest-undermining partisanship, criticizing
only the latter but referring to both as &ldquo;ideology&rdquo;. </p>

<p>
Regardless of the fault, the criticism of faulty ideology is not
concerned with individual cases of irrationality, immorality, or
ignorance, except as these are, at least, indicative or typical of
wide-spread irrationality, immorality, or ignorance with a social
etiology. Ideology critique is a form of social criticism, and it can
only proceed by showing that a certain form of rational, moral, or
epistemic failure is both widespread within a society or a group and
traceable to the common social situation of its sufferers. Two types
of social groups attract the special focus of ideology critics: the
&ldquo;negatively privileged&rdquo; or &ldquo;subordinate&rdquo;
(henceforth, &ldquo;the dominated&rdquo;) and the &ldquo;positively
privileged&rdquo; or &ldquo;ruling class&rdquo; (henceforth,
&ldquo;the dominant&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 id="RatFauIde">3.1 Rationally Faulty Ideology</h3>

<p>
When ideology is criticized for exhibiting or leading to faults of
rationality, the substance of the criticism is that an agent or group
of agents is in the grip of (a faulty) ideology just to the extent
that, due to certain social facts, they are partial to or partisans of
a state of affairs or course of action that is contrary to their own
interests. </p>

<p>
The conceptual connection between rationality and interests is tight;
an <em>interest</em> can be defined as &ldquo;the most rational course
of action in a predefined game, that is, a situation in which gain and
loss have already been defined&rdquo; (Therborn 1980 [1999: 10]).
However, the connection between interests and partiality or
partisanship seems equally tight; interests are rational strategies,
and therefore seem to be inherently instrumental
(&ldquo;partisan&rdquo;) and perspectival (&ldquo;partial&rdquo;).
This suggests that criticisms of interest-undermining ideology will
necessarily be conditional criticisms based on a descriptive
conception of ideology. An interested being is by definition partial
to their interests, and so it seems to follow that any interested
being will have ideological beliefs, and only a subset of those
ideological beliefs&mdash;the ones that somehow do not fulfill their
function of supporting the being&rsquo;s pursuit of their
interests&mdash;pose a problem.</p>

<p>
In fact, however, this does not obtain. Instead, the literature
displays a strongly bimodal distribution of criticisms of
interest-undermining ideology. A fully substantive conception of
rationality identifies rational strategies with the end to be achieved
(with well-being or human flourishing or the like). On this account,
rationality just is rational autonomy or rational self-determination
(Ng 2015). Therefore, critics of interest-undermining ideology go one
of two ways: either they embrace a formal or instrumental conception
of rationality and a descriptive conception of ideology, or else they
embrace a substantive conception of rational autonomy and a pejorative
conception of ideology. </p>

<p>
That partisanship or partiality can lead us into irrational beliefs
and behaviors is not seriously in doubt. For instance, a suburban car
commuter may vote for a mayoral candidate who praises the suburbs and
car culture and promises to slash funding for public transit and
expand downtown parking, even though the voter&rsquo;s interest as a
commuter&mdash;in being able to drive quickly and efficiently to
work&mdash;would be better served by decreasing demand for roadspace.
Being publicly affirmed in one&rsquo;s choices and one&rsquo;s
identity can override or derail a rational assessment of the available
options. </p>

<p>
Two types of criticism should be excluded from this category of
ideology critique, however. First, prioritizing short-term over
long-term interests is not a fault of rationality, per se, and cannot
furnish the basis for a critique of interest-undermining ideology,
even if it may be an incident of that critique. Strategizing for
long-term interests is beset by higher uncertainty in a way that
cannot be eliminated. Second, prioritizing individual interests over
group or collective interests is not itself a fault of rationality,
since it concerns a divergence between two different games. It is one
thing to say that the individualist cannot achieve their own ends by
their individualist strategy; it is another to say they should be
pursuing other, solidaristic ends (Gaventa 1980: 90). Criticism of
individualist strategies is better conceptualized, therefore, as aimed
at justice-undermining ideology rather than at interest-undermining
ideology. (A practical difficulty for the proponents of a fully
substantive conception of rationality is that this distinction is, on
principle, not available to them.)</p>

<h4 id="DomEspProRatFauIde">3.1.1 Are the Dominated Especially Prone to Rationally Faulty Ideology?</h4>

<p>
Here a special case must be considered. The belief that the dominated
are partial to or partisans of their own subordination, contrary to
their own interests, is widespread in the literature on ideology. It
is often taken for granted that there is a </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
tendency of the oppressed and exploited classes in a society to
believe in the justice or at least the necessity of the social order
that oppresses them. (Elster 1983: 146; compare Heath 2000: 363) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this context, the theory of ideology is supposed to answer the
question: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
why do the victims of oppression not rise up against their oppressors
(and sometimes not even seem to show any inclination to do so)?
(Finlayson 2015: 135; compare Lafont 2023: 391) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is supposed to answer this question by reference to the possession,
by the victims of oppression, of an ideological false consciousness,
&ldquo;a distorted view of social practices and institutions&rdquo;
(Lafont 2023: 391).</p>

<p>
Since this answer only pushes the question back one step (Cudd 2006:
55), the puzzle become: why do the dominated have a false
consciousness, or &ldquo;why do oppressed groups accept the ideology
of their own inferiority?&rdquo; (Stanley 2015: 222). This perspective
attributes to the members of dominated groups a belief (or set of
beliefs) about themselves and/or their situation the possession of
which is contrary to their own interests (Geuss 1981: 45). While there
is nothing odd about claiming that an individual may be mistaken about
a matter that affects their own best interests, it seems puzzling that
a significant group or class of people would commonly accept a false
belief that undermines their interests, since this implies a general,
unidirectional, and stubborn failure of rationality. Hence, Dotson
(2018) has dubbed it the &ldquo;Not-Very-Bright Thesis&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Numerous mechanisms for resolving this puzzle have been proposed in
the literature, but substantial doubts have also been raised about
each of them.</p>

<h5 id="SocMec">3.1.1.1 Sociological Mechanisms</h5>

<p>
By far the most commonly proposed mechanism is pedagogical
indoctrination or coercive socialization (Althusser 1995 [2014:
142&ndash;47]; Bartky 1990; Berger &amp; Luckmann 1966: 121&ndash;25;
Gaventa 1980: 22; Guha 1997: 165&ndash;69; Stanley 2015:
234&ndash;37). This is the basis of the dominant ideology thesis in
its classic form: the dominant group, monopolizing the means of mental
production, ensures that members of the dominated group internalize
the dominant belief system, which includes as a component the (false)
idea that members of the dominated group are incapable of self-rule or
freedom and are better off in their current, dominated position. </p>

<p>
Another commonly proposed mechanism is elite control of the media and
of expert authority. For example, it is claimed that, in any stable
society, &ldquo;the central moral, political and economic ideas that
dominate discussion in the mass media and in the corridors of
power&rdquo; will generally &ldquo;promote the interests of the ruling
class of that society&rdquo; (Leiter 2004 [2005: 159]). Similarly,
Stanley claims that, since belief is not under our direct voluntary
control, dominant group control of the authoritative narratives and
sources of testimonial evidence will result in dominated groups being
insulated from any alternative ideology, and therefore believing the
dominant account of their inferiority (2015: chap. 6). </p>

<p>
The effectiveness of these sociological mechanisms has been doubted,
however, on multiple grounds. First, since the socioeconomically
disadvantaged tend to be less exposed to elite media, have lower
educational attainment (and hence less exposure to elite expert
discourse), and exhibit lower levels of trust in conventional expert
opinion, it is unclear why these mechanisms would not be primarily
effective at securing coordination and cohesion among the dominant
(Scott 1990: chap. 3). Moreover, the legitimating discourses of the
dominant consists, at least in part, of the rules, promises, and
normative ideals that the present order is said to instantiate,
realize, or pursue, and these can be used to make demands of the
dominant (Gramsci 1971: 161; Piven &amp; Cloward 1977; Scott 1990:
chap. 4; Willis 1977). This has given rise to an adage for radical
organizers, &ldquo;Make the enemy live up to their own book of
rules&rdquo; (Alinsky 1971: 128). Third, as feminist standpoint
epistemologists have argued, the dominated can often draw upon the
direct evidence of their lives and the lives of those similarly
positioned in order to contest the guidance of dominant experts
(Hartsock 1983; McKinnon 2018). Finally, the dominant belief system is
very easily contradicted in two ways, with mental resources that would
seem to be universally available. A belief about a normative social
hierarchy might be contradicted either by reversal (e.g., &ldquo;the
last shall be first, and the first last&rdquo;) or by negation (e.g.,
&ldquo;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free, there is neither male nor female&rdquo;). Such reversals and
negations of dominant moral frameworks are widely attested among
subordinate groups historically, and this seems to call into question
the thesis that the dominated are, as a rule, susceptible to
internalizing interest-undermining ideological beliefs (Scott 1977a,
1977b, 1985: chap. 8).</p>

<h5 id="PsyMec">3.1.1.2 Psychological Mechanisms</h5>

<p>
Interest-undermining false consciousness might arise, instead, from
the operation of various psychological mechanisms within the social
context of subordination (Cudd 2006). </p>

<p>
Elster suggests, for example, an optical illusion or unwarranted
generalization, whereby the dominated attribute to the whole of
society a pattern or logic that obtains only locally, in the
neighborhood of society with which they are most familiar (1983:
145&ndash;46). For instance, a serf may recognize that they depend for
their well-being and protection on the local lord, and generalize from
this to the conclusion that a society of peasants without lords would
be intolerably miserable and violence-prone. However, Elster only
gives examples of academics either making this sort of error
themselves or stipulating that subaltern populations &ldquo;had to
believe&rdquo; something like this (1983: 146, including n. 12). </p>

<p>
Another proposed mechanism is &ldquo;stereotype threat&rdquo;, a
widely-studied phenomenon in social psychology. In a condition of
stereotype threat, members of a group subject to a negative social
stereotype are more likely to act in ways that seem to confirm the
stereotype. It has been suggested that this type of self-fulfilling
prophecy might underpin the adoption by subordinate groups of
ideological beliefs regarding their own abilities (Stanley 2015:
239&ndash;40; compare Cudd 2006: chap. 6). However, anxiety about
confirming a negative stereotype can affect performance without any
supposition that negative beliefs about oneself have been
internalized. Disidentification with dominant modes of
achievement&mdash;the hypothesized route by which negative stereotypes
become self-fulfilling prophecies&mdash;implies a mode of evaluation
contrary to the dominant mode, which is the opposite of what the
theory of ideological incorporation predicts.</p>

<p>
A third psychological mechanism that features widely in the literature
is preference adaptation, the spontaneous alteration of desires so as
to minimize cognitive dissonance or frustration (Elster 1983). In its
weaker form, this entails resignation, believing that the absence of
some previously desired social state of affairs is necessary, even if
regrettable. In its stronger form, it entails the belief that the
absence of some previously desired social state of affairs is just or
good. This psychological process is often referred to, generically, as
&ldquo;naturalization&rdquo; or &ldquo;reification&rdquo;, and the
stronger version is sometimes picked out as
&ldquo;legitimation&rdquo;. </p>

<p>
Whether preference adaptation is a significant phenomenon, or a case
of interest-undermining false consciousness, may be doubted, however.
In the first place, genuine instances of adaptive preferences would
have to be sorted out from cases of preference falsification, the
misrepresentation of one&rsquo;s desires in the face of perceived
pressure or opposition from others (Kuran 1995). The dominated have
good reason to falsify their preferences in most circumstances (Jacobs
1861 [2015]; Scott 1985, 1990). Even if genuine cases of adaptive
preferences can be identified, it is not clear that they are cases of
irrationality. If a desired social state of affairs really is out of
reach, changing one&rsquo;s beliefs about its desirability may be the
rational thing to do. Again, one must ask whether the adaptive
preference would adapt again if an avenue to the previously desired
outcome opens up. If it would&mdash;if, in the terms of the fable of
the fox and the sour grapes, the fox would decide that the grapes were
sweet after all were a means of attaining them presented&mdash;then
the adaptive preference is not a significant phenomenon. </p>

<h5 id="Con">3.1.1.3 Conclusions</h5>

<p>
Too much of the literature on interest-undermining ideology among the
dominated simply assumes what would have to be demonstrated, that
widespread ideological false consciousness leads the dominated
&ldquo;to believe that their place is deserved&rdquo; (Cudd 2006:
180). The &ldquo;massive fact of history that the values and the
beliefs of the subjects tend to support the rule of the dominant
group&rdquo; (Elster 1983: 166) is not so much a fact as an illusion:
the only evidence for it is that the subjects are not generally in
open revolt, but this is what ideological false consciousness is
supposed to explain, so it cannot count as evidence that the beliefs
of the subjects are, in fact, partial to their subordination.</p>

<p>
As Finlayson points out, if we accept that people are </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
imperfectly rational, imperfectly informed and somewhat confused,
often fearful, subject to more or less reasonable forms of hope, prone
to a condition sometimes termed learned helplessness, motivated to a
considerable extent to pursue what we would think of as their own
interests, but also motivated in ways that cannot plausibly be reduced
to this, for example, by aesthetic, altruistic, experimental or
self-destructive urges, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
then it is not really </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a mystery that such beings, having been born into a social order that
oppresses them, often do not rise up and overthrow it. (2015: 138)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No appeal to widespread false consciousness or ideological
incorporation is necessary to explain the persistence of oppressive
social systems.</p>

<p>
It might also be argued that the entire dispute about &ldquo;the
dominant ideology thesis&rdquo; was a red herring to begin with. Those
who proposed that ideology was a crucial factor in the persistence and
stability of systems of domination and exploitation were, in the first
instance, revolutionaries and radical reformers. What they meant,
arguably, was not that the dominated and exploited are partisans of
the system that dominates and exploits them, but that they are not yet
partisans of revolutionary or radical projects that aim to abolish
that system (Lenin 1902: chap. 2 [1973]). </p>

<p>
From this perspective, the diagnosis of &ldquo;false
consciousness&rdquo; among the dominated means only that the patient
is not an adherent of the best or correct political program or
practices, as identified by the diagnostician. In this sense, ideology
critique is endemic to popular, contestatory politics, which consists
in advocating one ideology (partisan view) against rivals and trying
to win over the uncommitted (Freeden 1996), in part by arguing that
adherents of rival ideologies are deluded or mistaken about the
rationality of their own partisan views. </p>

<h4 id="DomEspProRatFauIde_1">3.1.2 Are the Dominant Especially Prone to Rationally Faulty Ideology?</h4>

<p>
If the ideology-critical argument that the dominated are prone to
accepting interest-undermining ideology is questionable, however,
there appears to be better evidence for the converse theory: that the
<em>dominant</em> are, due to certain social facts, prone to accepting
interest-undermining false beliefs or myths, at least in certain
instances. (That the dominant might also adhere to interest-promoting
ideological beliefs is no surprise; any criticism of these beliefs
will base itself on moral or epistemic grounds.)</p>

<p>
It is an ancient complaint about tyrants and princes that they
surround themselves with flatterers and sycophants, but the prevalence
of the complaint suggests a structural cause: flattery is a strategy
among the dependent, since it may help them retain their office,
status, or even their life (Kapust 2018). The result is that the
dominant may find themselves surrounded by unreliable narrators, whose
testimony about states of affairs is regularly distorted by their
expectations about what the dominant want to hear. This is a
politically salient instance of preference falsification, since it may
lead the dominant to seriously underestimate opposition to their rule
(Kuran 1995: chap. 15). By this mechanism, then, the dominant may be
prone to accepting false beliefs about their own security, their own
virtue, and their own popularity, false beliefs that undermine their
rationality. </p>

<p>
The same factors may lead to the dominant being insulated from
rational arguments, such that they are less able to be rational
themselves. This, at least, was Frederick Douglass&rsquo;s claim about
slaveholders: because they never encourage frank conversation with the
slaves and other dependents who surround them, and because their every
whim is law, &ldquo;reason is imprisoned&rdquo; on a plantation, and
the slaveholder never learns how to control their own passions or to
pursue a reasoned policy (Douglass 1855 [2003: 61&ndash;62]). </p>

<h3 id="MorFauIde">3.2 Morally Faulty Ideology</h3>

<p>
When ideology is criticized for exhibiting or leading to moral faults,
the substance of the criticism is that an agent or group of agents is
in the grip of (a faulty) ideology just to the extent that, due to
certain social facts, they are partial to or partisans of a state of
affairs or course of action that is unjust. </p>

<p>
If, however, an agent is partial to or a partisan of an unjust social
system because that system seems to them to operate in their
interest&mdash;to deliver or secure for them important material and/or
social goods&mdash;then this situation is not generally considered to
call for ideology critique. A conflict between personal interests and
the demands of justice is too widely taken for granted to call forth
critical social theory in most cases. There are exceptions to this
rule. Theorists who claim that we have moral or ethical
interests&mdash;a rational interest in doing the right thing or in
acting according to our duty (e.g., Stanley 2015: 266)&mdash;may
assimilate the criticism of self-interested support for injustice to
ideology critique. Similarly, theorists who identify instrumental
rationality as an inappropriate governor of social interaction may
conclude that &ldquo;a state of society in which humans treat
themselves and others as if they were things, not people&rdquo; is a
reified state of society, and is the proper object of ideology
critique (Geuss 2008: 123). Note, however, that reification, even if
it has bad moral consequences, is subject to ideology critique for the
<em>epistemic</em> fault of mistaking a socially contingent
circumstance for something necessary (Geuss 1981; Habermas 1981
[1987]; Honneth 2008). </p>

<p>
The critique of justice-undermining ideology focuses on cases in
which, because of how they are socially situated, and perhaps contrary
to their own wishes and even efforts to the contrary, agents are
complicit in injustice. </p>

<p>
Accounts of structural injustice and findings from social psychology
(Young 2011; Jost 2020), have been mobilized in efforts to explain why
people often accept an unjust social and political status quo. The
question of ideological complicity is not, as in the critique of
interest-undermining ideology, directed at one group in
society&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you support a system that exploits
you?&rdquo;&mdash;but is addressed to everyone in
general&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you accept and help to reproduce an unjust
social system?&rdquo; The issue animating much of the recent writing
on ideology is, thus, &ldquo;how we all become agents of
injustice&rdquo; (Haslanger 2015: 12, n. 4).</p>

<p>
In this general form, however, the question admits of only one answer:
it depends. The causes and effects of unjust social practices are
often obscure or controversial. There is often great uncertainty or
disagreement about what practices would be genuinely disruptive of
structural injustices, even where there is agreement about the
existence of such injustices. Bucking established norms and practices
is likely a costly course of action, and when these costs are
compounded by the uncertainty that one&rsquo;s actions will contribute
to effective improvements, inaction (or minimal, conciliatory forms of
protest) may seem the most prudent course (Finlayson 2015; Heath 2000;
Sankaran 2020). </p>

<p>
However, this combination of ignorance, uncertainty, disagreement, and
costliness does not make a significant appearance in the most
prominent recent critical accounts of ideology (by way of contrast,
see Dworkin 1983). In general, the literature on the formal features
of social norms and the literature on ideology have parted ways
(Sankaran 2020). This does not mean there are no possibilities for
fruitful engagement, however. Ideology critique might be understood as
an effort to assist agents stuck in a suboptimal equilibrium, either
by redescribing the action-relevant characteristics of the options
they face so as to induce a change in preferences, or by highlighting
discounted possibilities for action, thereby expanding the set of
feasible options (Barrett 2022). The former would be appropriate where
agents are complicit because they do not know that or how their
actions contribute to injustice. The latter would be appropriate where
agents are complicit because they do not know how they can act so as
not to contribute to injustice. Both forms of ameliorative ideology
critique depend upon social theory (Haslanger 2019, 2022); they
require that the ideology critic possess knowledge of alternative
social norms or forms of action that are not&mdash;or not as
significantly&mdash;complicit in injustice.</p>

<h3 id="EpiFauIde">3.3 Epistemically Faulty Ideology</h3>

<p>
When ideology is criticized for exhibiting or leading to epistemic
faults, the substance of the criticism is that an agent or group of
agents is in the grip of (a faulty) ideology just to the extent that,
due to certain social facts, they are partial to or partisans of
untruths or other epistemically dubious beliefs. This is the most
diverse category of ideology critique. Generally speaking, an ideology
is criticized for exhibiting or leading to either (1) faults of scope,
(2) faults of modality, or (3) faults of reflective endorsement. </p>

<p>
Partisanship or partiality leads to a <em>fault of scope</em> when an
agent, because of their social position, background, or interests,
mistakes something particular or local for something universal or
general, or vice versa. It is commonly asserted, for instance, that
ideology represents a particular interest as a universal interest
(e.g., Celikates 2006: 33; Eagleton 1991: 56&ndash;58; Geuss 1981: 14;
&#381;i&#382;ek 1994: 10). This is very similar to the ideology
critique that Charles Mills directs at the social contract tradition.
The figure of the social contract is exemplary of the problem
diagnosed by the epigraph to <em>The Racial Contract</em>: &ldquo;When
white people say &lsquo;justice,&rsquo; they mean &lsquo;just
us&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mills 1997). A fault of scope critique is also
exemplified by Elster&rsquo;s analysis of cases in which members of
social classes exhibit a &ldquo;proneness to unwarranted
generalization&rdquo; that leads to making &ldquo;errors about social
causality&rdquo; specific to the class&rsquo;s position in the
economic structure of society (1983: 144&ndash;49). The same could be
said of some of the epistemic errors encoded in the formation and use
of stereotypes, insofar as these give a universal and/or normative
scope to select, privileged observations (Cudd 2006: chap. 3;
Haslanger 2014). </p>

<p>
Partisanship and partiality can also lead to the opposite epistemic
problem, however: taking general or universal aspects of human social
life to be the special property of one&rsquo;s own social group, or
acting as if they were. This may appear in political life as a variety
of what Bertrand Russell called &ldquo;emotive conjugation&rdquo; (as
stated by Griffin 1999), as, for example, &ldquo;we pursue justice,
you fetishize procedures, they are fanatics&rdquo;. In a case of
ideological bias, we may attribute to our own group or form of life an
exclusive or privileged exercise of certain generically human
capacities or virtues, simply because we experience and understand our
culture and customs from within. </p>

<p>
A different strand of epistemic ideology critique focuses, instead, on
<em>faults of modality</em>. Partisanship or partiality leads to a
fault of modality when an agent, because of their social position,
background, or interests, believes something contingent to be
something necessary, or vice versa. The most widely-encountered
instance of this type of epistemic ideology critique is the critique
of reification or naturalization, in which institutions, conventions,
and other &ldquo;social constructions&rdquo; are taken to be or
treated as if they were natural, eternal, inevitable, or otherwise not
amenable to human alteration or control (Berger &amp; Luckmann 1966:
88&ndash;92; Habermas 1981 [1987]; Honneth 2008; Luk&aacute;cs 1923
[1971]; Shelby 2003: 177; Thompson 1957). This is also called, by
Geuss, &ldquo;an &lsquo;objectification&rsquo; mistake&rdquo; (1981:
14). Critiques of ideological reification or naturalization tend to be
quite sweeping, but they are akin to a critical strategy that is used
more locally and on a smaller scale: the diagnosis of self-fulfilling
prophecies or self-confirming beliefs. In these cases, believing
something (or acting on a certain belief) generates evidence for the
belief. If the police believe that Black motorists are more likely to
possess illegal drugs, and act on that belief by implementing a form
of racial profiling, this will generate a disproportionate number of
drug arrests among Black motorists, a fact that may then be cited as
evidence for the belief that Black motorists are more likely to
possess illegal drugs. </p>

<p>
Again, ideology can also be criticized for the opposite modal error:
the necessary can appear to be contingent. Scapegoating and casting
blame can be a way of attributing to individual agents&rsquo;
contingent choices what would better be understood as a necessary
outcome of background social facts and institutional dynamics. A
feature of large-scale social interaction is that incentive structures
may make it inevitable or nigh inevitable that <em>some</em> agents
will engage in a particular behavior, even if it is impossible to say
<em>which</em> individual agents will engage in that behavior. To use
an example from Philip Pettit, that an increase in unemployment might
explain a subsequent increase in crime illustrates a form of
structural explanation in the social sciences that neither violates
the commitment to intentional psychology nor runs afoul of scientific
norms of explanation in other domains (Pettit 1996a: pt. II; building
on Jackson and Pettit 1990, 1992; see also: Haslanger 2016).
Therefore, a political campaign against crime that vilifies individual
figures might be criticized as knowledge-undermining ideology on the
grounds that it makes what is necessary (given the state of the
economic system) appear to be contingent on an identified set of
agents (Hall et al. 1978 [2013]).</p>

<p>
Partisanship or partiality leads to a <em>fault of reflective
endorsement</em> when an agent, because of their social position,
background, or interests, believes <em>x</em> only because of some
social facts, where these social facts (a) are not reasons for
believing <em>x</em>, and (b) are such that, awareness of these facts
would undermine the agent&rsquo;s belief in <em>x</em>. This is the
sort of fault that Engels intended with his claim that ideology is a
process accomplished with a false consciousness: the economic facts
and motives that actually cause the ideologist to believe certain
things cannot be acknowledged by the ideologist without undermining
the beliefs they gave rise to. Another prominent example of this form
of ideology critique is the critique of legitimation. Habermas and
other critical theorists argue that, if a belief in the legitimacy of
a form of domination could not be arrived at or sustained under
conditions of free and open deliberation, then the belief suffers a
fault of reflective endorsement. The belief is only sustained by a
background condition of coercion or fraud, the acknowledgment of which
is incompatible with maintaining the belief (Habermas 1981 [1987]; see
also: Geuss 1981: 26&ndash;44). Others have drawn on Susan
Stebbing&rsquo;s discussion of &ldquo;cherished beliefs&rdquo;,
beliefs that are &ldquo;pleasant to hold&rdquo; (Stebbing 1939: 40),
to characterize ideological beliefs as beliefs that are difficult to
rationally revise in the light of new evidence because they encode
identity-related expectations about the payout of social interactions
(Stanley 2015: chap. 6). While Stanley&rsquo;s account of ideology is
descriptive, it bears comparison with critical concerns about group
polarization and &ldquo;echo chamber&rdquo; effects, in which in-group
signaling overrides normal processes of belief revision. </p>

<p>
Many epistemic critiques of ideology combine these modes of
fault-finding. For instance, Aytac and Rossi have argued that ideas
that are not readily challenged tend to be epistemically inferior, and
the self-justificatory discourses of the powerful tend to be shielded
from contestation by the very power they justify (2023). Therefore,
these ideologies suffer from a fault of reflective
endorsement&mdash;being adhered to only because they are shielded from
criticism&mdash;but they will also typically exhibit faults of both
modality and scope. Similarly, if being subject to uncontrolled power
incentivizes strategies of dissimulation and feigned ignorance, then
the dominant will tend to form, on this basis, naturalized stereotypes
about the untrustworthiness and foolishness of the dominated, beliefs
which will shape the expectations of the dominant in hard-to-revise
ways (Roberts 2022). These epistemic faults will likely have negative
consequences for both the interest-seeking activity of the dominant
and for the justice of the society in question, but the basis of the
critique in both of these cases is the identification of epistemically
faulty partisanship or partiality. </p>
