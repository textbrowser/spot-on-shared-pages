<p>
Property is a general term for rules governing access to and control
of material resources and other things of value. Because these rules
are disputed, both in regard to their general shape and in regard to
their particular application, there are interesting philosophical
issues about the justification of property. Modern philosophical
discussions focus mostly on the issue of the justification of
<em>private</em> property rights (as opposed to common or collective
property), which refer to a system that allocates particular objects
like pieces of land to particular individuals to use and manage as
they please, to the exclusion of others (even others who have a
greater need for the resources), and to the exclusion also of any
detailed control by society. Though these exclusions make the idea of
private property seem problematic, philosophers have often argued that
it is necessary for the ethical development of the individual, or for
the creation of a social environment in which people can prosper as
free and responsible agents.</p>

<h2 id="WhyHavPhiTakIntProOwn">1. Why Have Philosophers Taken an Interest in Property and Ownership?</h2>

<p>
There are three principal reasons why property and ownership are of
philosophical interest. The first is conceptual or analytic. Given the
prominent role that property has played in moral and political
discourse concerning our normative interpersonal relations, one person
to another, and in our relations to the state, it is a significant
theoretical matter to determine the &lsquo;nature&rsquo; as it were,
of property and ownership. These issues will be addressed in Part 2.
The second concerns the issue of distributive justice. The
&lsquo;just&rsquo; distribution of property is a hugely contentious
matter that has generated a large literature in moral and
philosophical discourse. This matter will be considered in Part 5. The
third, which is perhaps the most important, is that property rights
have figured prominently in the theories of many &lsquo;great&rsquo;
philosophers, from Grotius to Hegel, as foundations both for the basic
interpersonal morality of individuals, one to another, and of
political systems in general. This will be considered in Parts 3 and
4.</p>

<h2 id="IssAnaDef">2. Issues of Analysis and Definition</h2>

<p>
More than most policy areas dealt with by political philosophers, the
discussion of property is beset with definitional difficulties.</p>

<p>
The first question we must ask is &ldquo;What are the (proper) objects
of property rules or property rights?&rdquo; In terms of our common
discourse, property rights are rights to physical things, objects,
goods, parcels of land, and so on. Although of economic value, your
right to your bank balance, company shares, and intellectual property
rights are not on this view property rights: they cannot be physically
touched, possessed, or occupied, so they do not belong. The second,
broader, concept of property includes not only tangible things, but
all alienable rights, that is, rights that can pass to another person.
Such a concept would include the rights in your bank balance, patents
and so on. Another way of explicating the latter concept of property
would be to equate property rights with &lsquo;alienable
assets&rsquo;. Anything that could pass to your creditors on
insolvency would count, which by the same token would encompass all
the rights that could be left by will or pass by inheritance. On
neither view would such rights as the right to vote or the right to
marry qualify as property rights. The former view emphasizes
<em>possessability</em> as the hallmark of property: if it cannot be
physically possessed, it is not property. The latter emphasizes
<em>alienability</em> as its essence: if I have a right, but it can
become yours, then it counts as property. One rationale for favouring
the latter, broader, concept is that it spans the realm of our
interactions with others that have been described as &lsquo;personality-poor&rsquo;
(Penner 1997a: ch 5) &ndash; where a right might just as well be someone
else&rsquo;s, it is a right that doesn&rsquo;t (or doesn&rsquo;t
deeply) implicate one&rsquo;s personality. Nevertheless, in what
follows we shall largely work with the former concept, rights in
physical resources, goods and land, as that is the one which has
largely figured in the discourse under review.</p>

<p>
Here a word must be said about property in land. Everyone, including
children from a young age, understands the idea of property rights
when it comes to all those possessable things we encounter throughout
our daily lives, which the common law calls &lsquo;chattels&rsquo;,
such as the furniture in the house, the clothes in our wardrobes, the
plates and glasses on the table, our books, pens, laptops and mobile
phones, and quantities of wheat or oil. It is my pen or it is someone
else&rsquo;s, and it is easy to grasp the idea of a right to exclusive
possession, that if it is mine others have an obligation not to take
it or damage it without my consent.</p>

<p>
Property in defined parcels of land is very different. One might say
that land is &lsquo;possessed&rsquo;, but a moment&rsquo;s thought
requires us to think of this as a term of art meaning occupation. A
person can occupy land, alone or with others, and just as we
understand the trespassory rules which give effect to the rights we
have in objects, so we understand similar trespassory rules in
relation to land: the obligation you have not to enter my land, damage
it, and, in particular, oust me from possession and take possession
yourself. But land is a very complicated object of property rights. To
name just a few of its features which complicate any regime of rules
in relation to land, and thus the titles people have to land:</p>

<ul>

<li>Land is immovable; indeed the name civil law gives to parcels of
land is &lsquo;immovables&rsquo;.</li>

<li>Outside Antarctica, parcels of land generally form part of a
state&rsquo;s territory, and its jurisdictional rules will
significantly shape what title to land amounts to.</li>

<li>Rights or titles to land are extremely malleable. It is, for an
example, doubtful that rights to land under feudal systems amounted to
property rights at all. People were attached to the land in various
capacities (serf, lord of a manor, seigneur, the king) but they did
not own it.</li>

<li>The landed surface of the earth is also the human environment,
each parcel related extensively to others in terms of the ecosystem of
which it is a part.</li>

<li>Whilst some non-land possessables can last forever and some, such
as works of art, are intentionally preserved to try to ensure this,
most such things do not; they wear out, are consumed, and so on. Land
lasts forever, although it can be &lsquo;destroyed&rsquo; in the
colloquial sense of being made unsuitable or dangerous for occupation
or use.</li>

<li>Possessables typically have clear-cut &lsquo;boundaries&rsquo; as
part of the nature of the thing in question. Some parcels of land have
natural boundaries, but most boundaries are artificial and have to be
maintained.</li>

<li>Land is contiguous, in the sense that plots of land will abut each
other, so that land owners have neighbors.</li>

<li>Whilst the use of some possessables requires
infrastructure&mdash;think of your mobile phone&mdash;rights to land
necessarily do, if only in terms of roads providing access.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These multiple features ramify in a number of ways, but the most
important way is this: since a parcel of land can exist forever, can
be consolidated with other parcels, and has a location, relating an
owner to the state, to neighbors, and to the environment, any
owner&rsquo;s use of land will necessarily have consequential effects
for others, both in space and in time.</p>

<p>
The second issue is to distinguish possible sets of rules regarding
property, or different property &lsquo;regimes&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, &lsquo;property&rsquo; is a general term for the
rules that govern people&rsquo;s access to and control of things like
land, natural resources, the means of production, manufactured goods,
and also (on some accounts) texts, ideas, inventions, and other
intellectual products. Disagreements about their use are likely to be
serious because resource-use matters to people. They are particularly
serious where the objects in question are both scarce and necessary.
Some have suggested that property relations only make sense under
conditions of scarcity (Hume 1739 [2007], SB 488. 494). But other
grounds of conflict are possible: there may be disagreements about how
a given piece of land should be used, which stem from the history or
symbolic significance <em>of that piece of land</em>, whether land in
general is scarce or not. (Intellectual property provides an example
of property rules that do not respond directly to scarcity; moreover
unlike material objects, the objects of intellectual property are not
crowdable, for their use by any one person does not preclude their use
by any number of
 others.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Any society with an interest in avoiding conflict needs such a system
of rules. This necessity is sometimes cited as an argument in favor of
<em>private</em> property (Benn &amp; Peters 1959: 155). In fact, all
it establishes is that there ought to be property rules of
<em>some</em> kind: private property rules are one variety. Some human
societies have existed for millennia, satisfying the needs and wants
of all their members, without private property or anything like it in
land or the other major resources of economic life. So the first step
in sound argumentation about property is distinguishing those
arguments which support the existence of property in general from
arguments which support the existence of a system of a specific kind
(Waldron 1988; Pateman 2002).</p>

<p>
There are any number of possible regimes of property rules; Harris
(1996: ch 2) considers six. Yet three species of property arrangement
have generally been considered as generic alternatives: common
property, collective property, and private property. In a <em>common
property</em> system, resources are governed by rules whose point is
to make them available for use by all or any members of the society. A
tract of common land, for example, may be used by everyone in a
community for grazing cattle or gathering food. A park may be open to
all for picnics, sports or recreation. The aim of any restrictions on
use is simply to secure fair access for all, to prevent anyone from
using the common resource in a way that would preclude its use by
others, and to ensure that the resource is not overused and so to
avoid the so-called &lsquo;tragedy of the commons&rsquo; (Hardin
1968). <em>Collective property</em> is a different idea: here the
community as a whole determines how important resources are to be
used. These determinations are made on the basis of the social
interest through mechanisms of collective
decision-making&mdash;anything from a leisurely debate among the
elders of a tribe to the forming and implementing of a Soviet-style
&lsquo;Five-Year Plan&rsquo;. Colletive or common ownership of the
Earth has figured in discussions of global justice (Risse 2012;
Olsthoorn 2018).</p>

<p>
In a <em>private property</em> system, rules are organized around the
idea that various contested resources are assigned to the decisional
authority of particular individuals (or families or firms). Thomas
Merrill (2012) calls this &lsquo;the property strategy&rsquo; and
contrasts it with bureaucratic governance or the management of
resources through group consensus. In a system of private property,
the person to whom a given object is assigned (e.g., the person who
found it or made it) has control over the object: it is for her to
decide what should be done with it, and she is not understood to be
acting as an agent or official of the society. She may act on her own
initiative without giving anyone else an explanation, or she may enter
into cooperative arrangements with others, just as she likes. She may
even transfer this right of decision to someone else, in which case
that person acquires the same rights she had. In general the right of
a proprietor to decide as she pleases about the resource that she owns
applies whether or not others are affected by her decision. If
Jennifer owns a steel factory, it is <em>for her</em> to decide (in
her own interest) whether to close it or to keep the plant operating,
even though a decision to close may have the gravest impact on her
employees and on the prosperity of the local community.</p>

<p>
Though private property is a system of individual decision-making, it
is still a system of social rules. The owner is not required to rely
on her own strength to vindicate her right to make self-interested
decisions about the object assigned to her: if Jennifer&rsquo;s
employees occupy the steel factory to keep it operating despite her
wishes, she can call the police and have them evicted; she does not
have to do this herself or even pay for it herself. So private
property is continually in need of public justification&mdash;first,
because it empowers individuals to make decisions about the use of
scarce resource in a way that is not necessarily sensitive to
others&rsquo; needs or the public good; and second, because it does
not merely permit that but deploys public force at public expense to
uphold it.</p>

<p>
Plainly private property and collective control are not all-or-nothing
alternatives. In every modern society, some resources are governed by
common property rules (e.g., streets and parks), some are governed by
collective property rules (e.g., military bases and artillery pieces),
and some are governed by private property rules (toothbrushes and
bicycles). Also, there are variations in the degree of freedom that a
private owner has over the resources assigned to him. Obviously, an
owner&rsquo;s freedom is limited by <em>background rules of
conduct</em>: I may not use my gun to kill another person. These are
not strictly property rules. More to the point are things like zoning
restrictions, which amount in effect to the imposition of a collective
decision about certain aspects of the use of a given resource. The
owner of a building in an historic district may be told, for example,
that she can use it as a shop, a home, or a hotel but she may not
knock it down and replace it with a skyscraper. In this case, we may
still say that the historic building counts as private property; but
if too many other areas of decision about its use were also controlled
by public agencies, we would be more inclined to say that it was
really subject to a collective property rule, with the
&lsquo;owner&rsquo; functioning as steward of society&rsquo;s
decisions.</p>

<p>
It is probably a mistake therefore to insist on any definition of
private property that implies a proprietor has absolute control over
his
 resource.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Some jurists have even argued that the terms &lsquo;property&rsquo;
and &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; should be eliminated from the technical
discourse of the law (Grey 1980). They say that calling someone the
&lsquo;owner&rsquo; of a resource conveys no exact information about
her rights in relation to that resource: a corporate owner is not the
same as an individual owner; the owner of intellectual property has a
different array of rights than the owner of an automobile; and even
with regard to one and the same resource, the rights (and duties) of a
landlord who owes nothing on his property might be quite different
from those of a mortgagor.</p>

<p>
The eliminative proposal makes sense to this extent: the position of a
private owner is best understood not as a single right to the
exclusive use and control of the object in question, but as a bundle
of rights, which may vary from case to case (Honor&eacute; 1961).</p>

<p>
In recent literature, the &lsquo;bundle of rights&rsquo; conception
has encountered resistance (Penner 1996; Smith 2012; Klein &amp;
Robinson 2011). Some theorists want to insist that property is better
conceived, as it is in colloquial usage, as a substantial relation
between a person and a thing (Smith 2012). This can be put forward on
analytic grounds or for ideological reasons; on the latter approach it
is said that the importance of property for a free society is obscured
when the ownership relation is treated as a divisible bundle of rights
(Attas 2006).</p>

<p>
Theorists who persevere with the &lsquo;bundle of rights&rsquo;
analysis nevertheless present some sticks in the bundle as more
important than others: the right to exclude is usually seen as the key
to ownership, even if it is one among many other rights and legal
relations that property comprises (Penner 1997a: ch 4). It is the
aspect of ownership that has the greatest impact on others (Waldron
1993). Other theorists are more skeptical about this. Katz (2008) and
Dagan (2011) suggest that in our analysis of private property we
should place less emphasis on the right to exclude and more on the
owner&rsquo;s power of agenda-setting so far as the use of a given
resource is concerned. On any account, &lsquo;exclusive use&rsquo; is
a complex idea. Its implications vary from context to context and from
object to object: we actually have a plurality of property
arrangements, striking different balances between owners&rsquo; and
others&rsquo; interests (Dagan 2013, 2021). And this thought takes us
to our third issue: the basic structure of a property right in modern,
&lsquo;liberal&rsquo;, societies.</p>

<p>
Title to tangible property typically comprises consists of one
(Hohfeldian) liberty which is protected with one (Hohfeldian) claim
right, and two (Hohfeldian) powers (Penner 2020, ch 1):</p>

<ol>

<li>The liberty to use (limited by background rules of conduct which
we have already noticed);</li>

<li>The right to exclusive possession, which correlates with a duty
upon all others not to act inconsistently with this right, by
committing an act of trespass or dispossession;</li>

<li>The power to license others to do what would otherwise amount to a
trespass, as for example when you invite someone into your house for
dinner;</li>

<li>The power to transfer the title to someone else.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The nature of this title is a default since in certain cases we find
not all of the incidents present or that they are modified in some
way. For example, jurisdictions which recognize a &lsquo;right to
roam&rsquo; limit the right to exclusive possession of land. Besides
this &lsquo;default&rsquo; title, which may be regarded as the right
of &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;, there are other interests that may be
created; we shall consider just three examples, security interests,
easements, and profits.</p>

<p>
A security interest is an interest in the property of another which
&lsquo;secures&rsquo; the performance of an obligation. The most
well-known security interests secure the repayment of money made by
way of loan, for example a mortgage over land. In other cases, the
secured property is colloquially referred to as the
&lsquo;collateral&rsquo; for the specific loan. A security interest in
property secures the payment obligation because if the borrower
defaults on his payments, the lender will have the right to take
possession of the property, sell it, and retain as much of the sale
proceeds as is required to clear the outstanding debt.</p>

<p>
An easement is a right to make use of another&rsquo;s land which is
less than the right to exclusive possession. An example easy to
understand is a right of way, where landowner A grants a right of way
to landowner B allowing B to cross A&rsquo;s land to gain quicker
access to another parcel of land B owns. Once created, this easement
will bind successors in title of both A and B. If A transfers his land
to C, then C will be bound to give effect to the easement, and if B
transfers his land to D, D will have the benefit of the easement, and
will be allowed to cross C&rsquo;s land.</p>

<p>
A profit (or to use the longer term employing common law French, a
&lsquo;profit &agrave; prendre&rsquo;) is the right to take physical
materials from the land of another, traditionally things such as
timber or minerals. The profit will bind successors in title just as
an easement does. In describing the effect of these interests in land,
common law lawyers say that these interests &lsquo;run with the
land&rsquo; to indicate that the grant of an easement or a profit is
not only personal as between the parties to the grant, but binds
successors in title.</p>

<p>
It is obviously socially important which such interests can be made to
run with the land in this way. In feudal England (we spare the reader
the legal terminology), a landowner might have the obligation to
provide soldiers (&lsquo;knights&rsquo;) to the King, and this
obligation would run with the land. This bespeaks a very different
attitude to land ownership than the one that prevails today. But the
possibilities are limited only by one&rsquo;s imagination. These
examples show that the default title we have described can be
augmented by further powers, to grant security interests, easements
and so on. In keeping with the &lsquo;bundles of rights&rsquo;
metaphor, we might say that ownership also comprises a &lsquo;bundle of
powers&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Most strikingly, perhaps, the owner is legally empowered to transfer
the whole bundle of rights in the object she owns to somebody
else&mdash;as a gift or by sale or as a legacy after death. With this
power, a private property system becomes self-perpetuating. After an
initial assignment of objects to owners, there is no further need for
the community or the state to concern itself with distributive
questions. Objects will circulate as the whims and decisions of
individual owners and their successive transferees dictate. The result
may be that wealth is widely distributed or it may be that wealth is
concentrated in a very few hands. It is part of the logic of private
property that no-one has the responsibility to concern themselves with
the big picture, so far as the distribution of resources is concerned.
Society simply pledges itself to enforce the rights of exclusion that
ownership involves wherever those rights happen to be. Any concern
about the balance between rich and poor must be brought in as a
separate matter of public policy (as tax and welfare policy or <em>in
extremis</em> large scale redistribution). As we shall see,
philosophers disagree as to whether this is an advantage or an
indictment of private property systems.</p>

<p>
At the furthest reaches of analysis, the concept of private property
becomes quite contestable. Many people believe that ownership implies
inheritance (see Part 5 below). But Mill once observed that the
private property idea implied only</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the right of each to his (or her) own faculties, to what he can
produce by them, and to whatever he can get for them in a fair market;
together with his right to give this to any other person if he
chooses. (Mill 1848: bk 2, ch 1, &sect;6 [1994: 28])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He said that passing the property of individuals who made no
disposition of it during their lifetime to their children</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
may be a proper arrangement or not, but it is no consequence of the
principle of private property. (ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Definitive resolution of such controversies is probably impossible.
Some philosophers have suggested that certain concepts should be
regarded as &lsquo;essentially contested concepts&rsquo; (see Gallie
1956); if there is anything to this suggestion, private property might
be one of them (see Waldron 1988: 51&ndash;2).</p>

<h2 id="HisOve">3. Historical Overview</h2>

<p>
There are extensive discussions of property in the writings of Plato,
Aristotle, Aquinas, Hegel, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Marx, and Mill.
The range of justificatory themes they consider is very broad, and
we shall begin with a summary.</p>

<p>
The ancient authors speculated about the relation between property and
virtue, a natural subject for discussion since justifying private
property raises serious questions about the legitimacy of
self-interested activity. Plato (<em>Republic</em>, 462b-c) argued
that collective ownership was necessary to promote common pursuit of
the common interest, and to avoid the social divisiveness that would
occur &ldquo;when some grieve exceedingly and others rejoice at the
same happenings&rdquo;. Aristotle responded by arguing that private
ownership promotes virtues like prudence and responsibility:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[W]hen everyone has a distinct interest, men will not complain of one
another, and they will make more progress, because every one will be
attending to his own business. (<em>Politics</em>, 1263a)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even altruism, said Aristotle, might be better promoted by focusing
ethical attention on the way a person <em>exercises</em> his rights of
private property rather than questioning the institution itself
(ibid.). Aristotle also reflected on the relation between property and
freedom, and the contribution that ownership makes to a person&rsquo;s
being a free man and thus suitable for citizenship. The Greeks took
liberty to be a status defined by contrast with slavery, and for
Aristotle, to be free was to belong to oneself, to be one&rsquo;s own
man, whereas the slave was by nature the property of another.
Self-possession was connected with having sufficient distance from
one&rsquo;s desires to enable the practice of virtuous self-control.
On this account, the natural slave was unfree because his reason could
not prescribe a rule to his bodily appetites. Aristotle had no
hesitation in extending this point beyond slavery to the conditions of
&ldquo;the meaner sort of workman.&rdquo; Obsessed with need, the poor
are &ldquo;too degraded&rdquo; to participate in politics like free
men. &ldquo;You could no more make a city out of paupers,&rdquo; wrote
Aristotle, &ldquo;than out of slaves&rdquo; (<em>Politics</em>,
1278a). They must be ruled like slaves, for otherwise their pressing
and immediate needs will issue in envy and violence. Some of these
themes have emerged more recently in civic republican theories, though
modern theories of citizenship tend to begin with a sense of who
should be citizens (all adult residents) and then proceed to argue
that they should all have property, rather than using existing wealth
as an independent criterion for the franchise (King &amp; Waldron
1988).</p>

<p>
In the medieval period, Thomas Aquinas continued discussion of the
Aristotlean idea that virtue might be expressed in the use that one
makes of one&rsquo;s property. But Aquinas gave it a sharper edge. Not
only do the rich have moral obligations to act generously, but the
poor also have rights against the rich. Beginning from the premise
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[a]ccording to the natural order established by Divine Providence,
inferior things are ordained for the purpose of succoring man&rsquo;s
needs&hellip;, (<em>ST</em> II-II, Q66.A1 resp)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Aquinas argued that no division of resources based on human law can
prevail over the necessities associated with destitution. This is a
theme which recurs throughout our tradition&mdash;most notably in
Locke&rsquo;s <em>First Treatise on Government</em> (Locke 1689: I,
para. 42)&mdash;as an essential qualification of whatever else is said
about the legitimacy of private property (Horne 1990).</p>

<p>
In the early modern period, philosophers turned their attention to the
way in which property might have been instituted, with Hobbes and Hume
arguing that there is no natural &lsquo;mine&rsquo; or
&lsquo;thine,&rsquo; and that property must be understood as the
creation of the sovereign state (Hobbes 1642/1651]) or at the very
least the artificial product of a convention</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
enter&rsquo;d into by all the members of the society to bestow
stability on the possession of&hellip;external goods, and leave every
one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune
and industry. (Hume 1739 [2007], SB 399)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
John Locke (1689), on the other hand, was adamant that property could
have been instituted in a state of nature without any special
conventions or political decisions.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s theory is widely regarded as the most interesting of the
canonical discussions of property. In part this is a result of how he
began his account; because he took as his starting point that God gave
the world to men in common, he had to acknowledge from the outset that
private entitlements pose a moral problem. How do we move from a
common endowment to the &lsquo;disproportionate and unequal Possession
of the Earth&rsquo; that seems to go along with private property?
Unlike some of his predecessors, Locke did not base his resolution of
this difficulty on any theory of universal (even tacit) consent.
Instead, in the most famous passage of his chapter on property, he
gave a moral defense of the legitimacy of unilateral
appropriation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Though the Earth&hellip;be common to all Men, yet every Man has a
Property in his own Person. This no Body has any Right to but himself.
The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we may say, are
properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the State that Nature
hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his Labour with, and
joyned to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his
Property. It being by him removed from the common state Nature placed
it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes
the common right of other Men. (Locke 1689: II, para. 27)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The interest of Locke&rsquo;s account lies in the way he combines the
structure of a theory of first occupancy with an account of the
substantive moral significance of labor. In the hands of writers like
Samuel Pufendorf (1672 [1991: 84]), First Occupancy theory proceeded
on the basis that the first human user of a natural resource&mdash;a
piece of land, for example&mdash;is distinguished from all others in
that he did not have to displace anyone else in order to take
possession. It did not particularly matter <em>how</em> he took
possession of it, or what sort of use he made of it: what mattered was
that he began acting as its owner without dispossessing anyone else.
Now although Locke used the logic of this account, it <em>did</em>
matter for him that the land was cultivated or in some other way used
productively. (For this reason, he expressed doubts whether indigenous
hunters or nomadic peoples could properly be regarded as owners of the
land over which they roamed.) This is partly because Locke identified
the ownership of labor as something connected substantially to the
primal ownership of self. But it was also because he thought the
productivity of labor would help answer some of the difficulties which
he saw in First Occupancy theory. Though the first occupier does not
actually dispossess anyone, still his acquisition may prejudice
other&rsquo;s interests if there is not, in Locke&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;enough and as good left in common&rdquo; for them to enjoy
(Locke 1689: II, para. 27). Locke&rsquo;s answer to this difficulty
was to emphasize that appropriation by <em>productive</em> labor
actually increased the amount of goods available in society for others
(1689: II, para. 37). There is also something like a strand of moral
desert in Locke&rsquo;s theory: if one person fails to take advantage
of an opportunity of resource-use or resource development, can that
person really complain or demand compensation when the opportunity is
taken up by someone else (de Jasay 2004)?</p>

<p>
Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s work on property is more formal and abstract
than Locke&rsquo;s and&mdash;at least until recently-it was less
well-known. (But now see Byrd &amp; Hruschka 2006 and Ripstein 2009.)
Kant began by emphasizing a general connection between property and
agency, maintaining that there would be an affront to agency and thus
to human personality, if some system were not arrived at which could
permit useful objects to be used (Weinrib 2018). He inferred from this
that &ldquo;it is a duty of right to act towards others so that what
is external (usable) could also become someone&rsquo;s&rdquo; (Kant
1797 [1996], AK 6:252) Though this legitimated unilateral
appropriation, it did so only in a provisional way. Since the
appropriation of a resource as private property affects everyone
else&rsquo;s position (imposing duties on them that they would
otherwise not have), it cannot acquire full legitimacy by unilateral
action: it must be ratified by an arrangement which respects
everyone&rsquo;s interests in this matter. So the force of the
principle requiring people to act so that external objects can be used
as property also requires them to enter into a civil constitution,
which will actually settle who is to be the owner of what on a basis
that is fair to all.</p>

<p>
G.W.F. Hegel&rsquo;s account of property centers on the contribution
property makes to the development of the self (1820 [1967], p 40,
para. 41): &ldquo;A person must translate his freedom into an external
sphere in order to exist as Idea&rdquo;, thus giving some sort of
external reality to what would otherwise be the unexploited <em>mere
potentiality</em> for individual freedom (Penner 1997a: ch 8; Brudner
&amp; Nadler 2013: ch 3). (&lsquo;Idea&rsquo; for Hegel, is what we
apprehend when we understand something, for example beauty, not merely
as an abstract concept but as a phenomenon in the real world. As
regards a property right, this would be the apprehension of the right
as it is instantiated in actual human affairs, in the real world.)
These rather obscure formulations were taken up also by the English
idealists, most notably by T.H. Green (1886 [1895]), who emphasized
the contribution that ownership makes to ethical development, to the
growth of the will and a sense of responsibility. But neither of these
writers thought of the development of the individual person as the
be-all and end-all of property. In both cases it was thought of as a
stage in the growth of social responsibility. Both saw the freedom
embodied in property as ultimately <em>positive</em>
freedom&mdash;freedom to choose rationally and responsibly for the
wider social good. In Karl Marx&rsquo;s philosophy, Hegel&rsquo;s
sense of there being several stages in the growth of positive freedom
is framed in terms of stages of social development rather than stages
of the growth of individuals (Marx 1862). And for Marx, as for Plato,
social responsibility in the exercise of private property rights is
never enough. The whole trajectory of the development of modern
society, says Marx, is towards large-scale cooperative labor. This may
be masked by forms of property that treat vast corporations as private
owners, but eventually this carapace will be abandoned and
collectivist economic relations will emerge and be celebrated as
such.</p>

<p>
The general merits of private property versus socialism thus became a
subject of genuine debate in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
John Stuart Mill, with his characteristic open-mindedness treated
communism as a genuine option, and he confronted objections to the
collectivist ideal with the suggestion that the inequitable
distribution of property in actually existing capitalist societies
already partakes of many of these difficulties. He insisted however,
that private property be given a fair hearing as well:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If&hellip;the choice were to be made between Communism&hellip;and the
present state of society with all its sufferings and
injustices,&hellip;all the difficulties, great or small, of Communism
would be but as dust in the balance. But to make the comparison
applicable, we must compare Communism at its best, with the regime of
individual property, not as it is, but as it might be made&hellip;The
laws of property have never yet conformed to the principles on which
the justification of private property rests. (Mill 1848: bk II, ch 1,
&sect;2 [1994: 14&ndash;15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mill is surely right, at least so far as the aims of a philosophical
discussion of property are concerned. Indeed, one way of looking at
the history we have just briefly surveyed is that it is the history of
successive attempts to tease out, from the mess of actually-existing
maldistribution and exploitation, some sense of the true principles on
which the justification of an ideal system of private property would
rest, and a sense too of other aspects of moral enterprise which such
an institution might serve.</p>

<p id="PropPhilIssu">
Some have suggested that philosophers need not be interested in
property in these ways. John Rawls argued that questions about the
system of ownership are secondary or derivative questions, to be dealt
with pragmatically rather than as issues in political philosophy
(Rawls 1999: 235&ndash;42). Although every society has to decide
whether the economy will be organized on the basis of markets and
private ownership or on the basis of central collective control, there
was little that philosophers could contribute to these debates.
Philosophers, Rawls said, are better off discussing the abstract
principles of justice that should constrain the establishment of
<em>any</em> social institutions, than trying to settle <em>a
priori</em> questions of social and economic strategy. His own
suggestions favoring the institutions of &lsquo;a property-owning
democracy&rsquo; are put forward more as intermediate principles than
as fundamentals of justice.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, with the growing attention that is being paid in
the discipline to public policy generally, it is difficult to deny
that questions about property can be posed in terms that are abstract
enough for philosophers to address. Though Rawls counsels us to talk
about justice rather than property, in fact issues about property are
inevitably implicated in some of the issues about justice that have
preoccupied political philosophers in recent years. Certain property
institutions may be better than others for justice. A system of
markets and private property covering all or most of the resources in
society will make it very difficult to ensure the steady application
of principles like equality, distribution according to need, or even
as some have argued&mdash;see, e.g., Hayek (1976)&mdash;distribution
according to desert. Some have argued that property rights in a market
economy ought to be treated as resistant to redistribution and perhaps
as insensitive to distributive justice generally except possibly at
the moment of their initial allocation (see Nozick 1974). If we take
this view and if we also take distributive issues seriously, we may
have to commit ourselves to a compromised or eclectic system rather
than a pure market system of private property.</p>

<p>
In contrast with Locke, Kant and Hegel, David Hume contended that
there is nothing <em>natural</em> or <em>native</em> to us
about private property. The &ldquo;contrariety&rdquo; of our passions
and the &ldquo;looseness and easy transition [of material objects]
from one person to another&rdquo; mean that any situation in which I
hold or use a resource is always vulnerable to disruption (Hume 1739
[2007], SB 487, 489). Until possession is stabilized by social rules,
there is no secure relation between person and thing. We may think
that there ought to be: we may think, for example, that a person has a
moral right to something that he has made and that society has an
obligation to give legal backing to this moral right. But according to
Hume, we have to ask what it is in general for society to set up and
enforce rules of this kind, before we can reach any conclusions about
the normative significance of the relation between any particular
person and any particular thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Our property is nothing but those goods, whose constant possession is
establish&rsquo;d by the laws of society; that is, by the laws of
justice. Those, therefore, who make use of the words property, or
right, or obligation, before they have explain&rsquo;d the origin of
justice, or even make use of them in that explication, are guilty of a
very gross fallacy, and can never reason upon any solid foundation. A
man&rsquo;s property is some object related to him. This relation is
not natural, but moral, and founded on justice. Tis very preposterous,
therefore, to imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without
fully comprehending the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in
the artifice and contrivance of man. The origin of justice explains
that of property. The same artifice gives rise to both. (Hume 1739
[2007], SB 491)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Humean view of property as a convention has been taken up by
Murphy and Nagel (2002) as a basis for resisting the view,
associated with Nozick 1974, that property rights can pose any moral
obstacle to programs of tax and transfer or other forms of
redistribution and social control. But the fact that something is
conventional doesn&rsquo;t mean it can safely be treated as malleable
or as something that can be overridden without cost. There is always a
further question about the moral reasons that there are for holding
conventions steady; and these reasons may actually echo other themes
in the property debate.</p>

<p>
Before Hume, the view that the issue of property begged questions
about the general basis of social organization was already
foreshadowed in the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. Indeed
Hobbes regarded property as the key to political philosophy:
&ldquo;[M]y first enquiry was to be from whence it proceeded, that any
man should call any thing rather his <em>Owne</em>, th[a]n <em>another
mans</em>&rdquo; (Hobbes 1642/51: Epistle Dedicatory, para 9 [1983:
26&ndash;7]). For Hobbes, property rules were the product of
authority&mdash;the acknowledged authority of a sovereign, whose
commands could guarantee the peace and make it safe for men to embark
on social and economic activities that outstripped their ability to
protect themselves using their own individual strength. Hume, by
contrast, was interested in the possibility that the relevant
settlement might emerge as conventions from ordinary human
interactions rather than as impositions by an acknowledged figure in
authority (Hume 1739 [1978:
 490]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Still even if we concede that property is the product of social rules,
and that normative thinking about the former must be preceded by
normative thinking about the latter, there might be facts about the
human condition or our agency as embodied beings that provide
philosophical premises for an argument that property relations should
be established in one way rather than another. Clearly, there is at
least one material object with which a person does seem to have an
intimate pre-legal relation that would bear some philosophical
analysis&mdash;namely, that person&rsquo;s body. We are embodied
beings and to a certain extent the use and control of our limbs,
sensory organs etc. is indispensable for our agency. Were a person to
be deprived of this control&mdash;were others to have the right to
block or manipulate the movements of his physical body&mdash;then his
agency would be truncated, and he would be incapable of using his
powers of intention and action to make something he (and others) could
regard as a life for himself. Some modern authors, following John
Locke, have tried to think about this in terms of an idea of
self-ownership. According to G.A. Cohen (1995) a person owns himself
when he has all the control over his own body that a master would have
over him were he a slave. Now since a master is entitled to make
comprehensive use of his slave for his own profit without owing any
account or any contribution to anyone else, it seems to follow from
the idea of self-ownership that a person must be allowed to profit
equally comprehensively from the control of his own mental and bodily
resources. Taking his cue from Nozick (1974) that taxation on earnings
is a form of coerced labor (for others or for the state), Cohen
concludes that various egalitarian arrangements (like welfare paid for
out of taxation) are incompatible with the self-ownership of the rich.
It looks like we have to choose between principles of equality and
principles of self-ownership. Debate on this issue continues (Otsuka
1998; Vrousalis 2011; Sobel 2012): some argue that what we owe to
others must be figured out first before there can be any question of
owning either our selves, our bodies, or other material resources;
while others say that any attempt to make the argument in that order
will lead to counter-intuitive results (Nozick 1974: 234). Some recent
discussions have called into question the very idea of self-ownership
(Harris 1996: 184&ndash;197; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008; Phillips 2013;
Hacker 2010: 279&ndash;283), denying that this concept is necessary in
order to capture the inviolability of the human person.</p>

<p>
There is a further question whether self-ownership affords a basis for
thinking about property in external objects other than my body? John
Locke thought that it did (Locke 1689: II, para. 27). He suggested
that when I work on an object or cultivate a piece of land, I project
something of my self-owned self into the thing. That something I have
worked on embodies a part of me is a common enough sentiment, but it
is difficult to give it a analytically precise sense. That an object
is shaped the way it is may be an effect of my actions; but actions
don&rsquo;t seem to have the trans-temporal endurance to enable us to
say that <em>they</em> remain present in the object after the time of
their performance. The idea of mixing one&rsquo;s labor seems to be a
piece of rhetoric which enhances other arguments for private property
rather than an argument in its own right.</p>

<p>
Others have speculated about an effect in the opposite
direction&mdash;not so much the incorporation of the self into the
object as the incorporation of the thing into the self (Radin 1982).
As we have seen, something akin to this can be found in Hegel&rsquo;s
work, where he says (Hegel 1820 [1967], p 40, para. 41): &lsquo;A
person must translate his freedom into an external sphere in order to
exist as Idea.&rsquo; In plain English, the taking of possession of
property and acting upon it in various ways gave them the
opportunity to make concrete the plans and schemes that would
otherwise just buzz around inside their heads, and to take
responsibility for their intentions as the material they were working
on&mdash;a home or an sculptor&rsquo;s block of
marble&mdash;registered the impact of the decisions they had made,
i.e. the &lsquo;translation of their freedom&rsquo; into the external
world (see Waldron 1988: 343&ndash;89). Even the utilitarian
Jeremy Bentham toyed with a version this idea. Though property, he
said, depended on positive law, the law of property had an effect on
the self that makes redistribution particularly objectionable. Law
provided security for our expectations, and when that security came to
be focused on a particular object, that object formed part of the
structure of one&rsquo;s agency:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is hence that we have the power of forming a general plan of
conduct; it is hence that the successive instants which compose the
duration of life are not like isolated and independent points, but
become continuous parts of a whole. (Bentham 1802 [1931: 111])</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="GenPro">4. Genealogies of Property</h2>

<p>
In our philosophical tradition, arguments about the justification of
property have often been presented as genealogies: as stories about
the way in which private property might have emerged in a world that
was hitherto unacquainted with the institution.</p>

<p>
The best known are Lockean stories (Locke 1689 and Nozick 1974). One
begins with a description of a state of nature and an initial premise
about land belonging to nobody in particular. And then one tells a
story about why it would be sensible for individuals to appropriate
land and other resources for their personal use and about the
conditions under which such appropriations would be justified.
Individuals have needs and they find themselves surrounded with
objects capable of satisfying those needs. But each person,
<em>X</em>, is vaguely aware that the objects have not been furnished
by God or nature for <em>X</em>&rsquo;s use alone; others have a need
for them as well. So what is <em>X</em> to do? One thing is clear: if
<em>X</em> has to wait for some general meeting of everyone who might
be affected by his use of the resources in his vicinity before he is
allowed to use them then, as Locke put it, &ldquo;man had starved,
notwithstanding the plenty God had given him&rdquo; (Locke 1689: II,
para. 28). So the individual goes ahead and takes what he needs (1689:
I, para. 86). He &ldquo;mixes his labor&rdquo; with the object he
needs, and by doing so he fulfills his fundamental duty of
self-preservation, while also increasing the value of the resources he
works on for the indirect benefit of others. The first phase of
Locke&rsquo;s story involves individuals satisfying their needs out of
the common largesse in this virtuous and self-reliant way. The second
phase of the story involves their exchanging surplus goods that they
have appropriated with one another; rather than saying that such
surpluses lapse back into the common heritage, Locke allows
individuals to acquire, grow, or make more than they can use so that
markets become possible and prosperity general (1689: II, paras.
46&ndash;51). With markets and prosperity, however, comes inequality,
avarice and envy, and the third and last stage of Locke&rsquo;s
account is the institution of government to protect the property
rights that have grown up in this way (1689: II, paras. 123 ff.) The
story assumes that individuals are able to reason through these issues
of who is entitled to appropriate and use and exchange goods without
the tutelage of government, and that at neither the first stage nor
the second stage is any social or political decision-making about
property required.</p>

<p>
In its most basic aspect, Locke&rsquo;s genealogy has the character of
a First Occupancy story. In the first instance, the legitimacy of an
individual&rsquo;s appropriation stems largely from the fact that it
does not involve the direct expropriation of anyone else: by
definition the &ldquo;first occupancy&rdquo; is peaceful. There are,
of course, strong elements of utilitarian and virtue theory in
Locke&rsquo;s account too&mdash;the productivity of labor and the
privileging of what Locke calls &ldquo;the Industrious and the
Rational&rdquo; over the &ldquo;Covetousness of the Quarrelsom and
Contentious&rdquo; (1689: II, para. 34). But the issue of historical
priority is indispensable. Whose use of a given resource came first is
crucial, and the order in which goods were subsequently transferred
from hand to hand is indispensable for understanding the legitimacy of
current entitlements. Robert Nozick (1974) has done more than anyone
else to elucidate the form of this kind of &ldquo;historical
entitlement&rdquo; theory.</p>

<p>
Not all genealogies of property have this shape. David Hume tells a
completely different sort of story. On his approach, we begin by
assuming that since time immemorial, people have been fighting over
resources, so that the distribution of <em>de facto</em> possession at
any given time is arbitrary, being driven by force, cunning, and luck.
Now it is possible that such fighting will continue indefinitely. But
it is also possible that it may settle down into a sort of stable
equilibrium in which those in possession of significant resources and
those tempted to grab resources from others find that the marginal
costs of further predatory activity are equal to their marginal gains.
Under these conditions, something like a &lsquo;peace dividend&rsquo;
may be available. Maybe everyone can gain, in terms of the diminution
of conflict, the stabilizing of social relations, and the prospects
for market exchange, by an agreement not to fight any more over
possessions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I observe, that it will be for my interest to leave another in the
possession of his goods, <em>provided</em> he will act in the same
manner with regard to me. He is sensible of a like interest in the
regulation of his conduct. When this common sense of interest is
mutually express&rsquo;d, and is known to both, it produces a suitable
resolution and behaviour.&hellip; (Hume 1739 [1978: 490])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a resolution, if it lasts, may amount over time to a ratification
of <em>de facto</em> holdings as <em>de jure</em> property. As with
Locke&rsquo;s account, the state comes into the picture much later to
reinforce conventions of property that emerge informally in this way
(Hume 1739 [1978: 534 ff.]). But notice how much more modest
Hume&rsquo;s story is than the Lockean account in the moral claims
that it makes (see Waldron 1994). The stability of the emergent
distribution has nothing to do with its justice, nor with the moral
quality of the actions by which goods were appropriated. It may be
fair or unfair, equal or unequal, but the parties already know that
they cannot hope for a much better distribution by pitching their own
strength yet again against that of others. (See also Buchanan 1975 for
a modern version of this approach.)</p>

<p>
As an account of the genesis of property, Hume&rsquo;s theory has the
advantage over its main rivals of acknowledging that the early eras of
human history are eras of conflict largely unregulated by principle
and opaque to later moral enquiry. It does not require us to delve
into history to ascertain who did what to whom, and what would have
happened if they had not. Once a settled pattern of possession
emerges, we simply draw an arbitrary line and say, &lsquo;Property
entitlements start from <em>here</em>.&rsquo; The model has important
normative consequences for the present as well. Those who are tempted
to question or disrupt an existing distribution of property must
recognize that far from ushering in a new era of justice, their best
efforts are likely to inaugurate an era of conflict in which all bets
are off and in which virtually no planning or cooperation is possible.
The weakness of the Humean approach is the obverse of its strength.
The moral considerations that it marginalizes actually do matter to
us. For example, we would not be happy with a Humean convention
ratifying slavery or cannibalism, but for all that Hume shows it may
well be a feature of the equilibrium emerging from the age of conflict
that some people are in possession of others&rsquo; bodies. The point
is that even if Hume is right that the sentiment of justice is built
up out of a convention to respect one another&rsquo;s <em>de
facto</em> possessions, that sentiment once established can take on a
life of its own, so that it can subsequently be turned against the
very equilibrium that engendered it (Waldron 1994).</p>

<p>
A third variety of property-story makes the state and the social
contract more fundamental than it is in either Locke&rsquo;s or
Hume&rsquo;s approach. We are to imagine a period where people try and
rely on their own physical and moral initiative to take possession of
the resources which they need or want, but in which it become
increasingly apparent that institution of reliable property
arrangements is going to have to involve a social decision. Eventually
property must be based on consent&mdash;the consent of everyone
affected by decisions about the use and control of a given set of
resources. This theory is associated with the normative political
philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762) and Immanuel Kant (1797).
As we have seen, the Lockean critique of this sort of approach was
always that urgency of material need left no time for social consent.
In fact the Rousseau/Kant approach has little difficulty with this
point. There can be provisional appropriations made unilaterally (Ryan
1984: 80). But every such appropriation is subject in principle to the
consent of all and must be offered up for social ratification. In
other words, the urgency of immediate need is not taken as a basis of
discrediting the review and redistribution of possession by society as
a whole if serious distributive anomalies are emerging.</p>

<p>
What all this actually yields in the way of a legitimate assignment of
resources to individuals is a matter of the distributive principles
that survive the test of ratification by the general will. Rawlsian,
egalitarian and utilitarian approaches are all imaginable under the
auspices of this account. The essence of the Rousseau/Kant approach is
that society&rsquo;s deployment of principles like these to evaluate
existing distributions is never trumped by the history of entitlements
and it is never excluded by the Humean conventions that may have
emerged as a cosy equilibrium among those who are actually in
possession.</p>

<p>
What claims are being made in and about these stories? Are we to
assume that one of them is literally true? Or what are we to infer
from their falsity (if they are historically inaccurate)? Does it
follow that property is illegitimate? A number of philosophers have
suggested recently that a genealogy can make an important contribution
to our understanding of a phenomenon even when it is not literally
true: Bernard Williams (2002) has suggested this about language and
the emergence of truth-telling, following Edward Craig (1999)&rsquo;s
genealogical account of our possession of the concept of knowledge.
Robert Nozick has also discussed the value of what he calls
&ldquo;potential explanations&rdquo;&mdash;stories that would explain
how something happened if certain things were the case (some of which
in fact are not the case):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To see how in principle, a whole realm could fundamentally be
explained greatly increases our understanding of the realm&hellip;We
learn much by seeing how the state could have arisen, even if it
didn&rsquo;t arise that way. (Nozick 1974: 8&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The genealogies we have considered may differ in this regard. The
Rousseau/Kant approach helps us understand why private property is
inherently a matter of social concern and the Humean approach helps us
see the value of property in providing people with a fixed and
mutually acknowledged basis on which the rest of social life can be
built, whether or not it answers to our independent intuitions of
justice. But the Lockean genealogy may explain little or nothing about
property entitlements unless it is actually true. As Nozick
acknowledges (1974: 151&ndash;2), a modern state should not feel
morally constrained by property holdings which might have had a
Lockean pedigree but in fact do not. In this regard it is interesting
that one of the main uses of Lockean theory these days is in defending
the property rights of indigenous people&mdash;where a literal claim
is being made about who had first possession of a set of resources and
about the need to rectify the injustices that accompanied their
subsequent expropriation (see Waldron 1992).</p>

<p>
A last genealogical account is centred around the primacy of use
rights. It seems common ground that persons cannot rightly be denied
the right to make use of the resources of the earth without the
constant interference of others. At a bare minimum, then, individuals
are justifiably held to have use rights in the material resources of
the earth. Use rights (aka &lsquo;usufructory rights&rsquo;) can be
variously described (Westphal 1997: 151&ndash;151; Westphal 2016:
146&ndash;149; Penner 2020: 177&ndash;180) but the basic features of a
use right are these: (1) it is limited by the actual uses a person is
making of some thing; (2) it is limited in time, i.e., lasts only so
long as the person is using it; (3) there is no right of transfer of
the thing; (4) it is in principle non-exclusive. A second or third or
nth person can make use of a thing so long as no prior use is
interfered with. Use-rights align in certain respects with
Katz&rsquo;s (2008) characterisation of the owner as &lsquo;agenda
setter&rsquo;. The first user sets the agenda for the thing, by making
uses by others which are incompatible with her use off-limits. But
another person is not disentitled from using the thing so long as his
use does not interfere with the first user&rsquo;s use. So, for
example, a person does no wrong by crossing through the first
user&rsquo;s orchard so long as he does not damage the fruit trees or
in any other way interfere with the first owner&rsquo;s use of the
land as an orchard. However attractive this picture is, there is a
compelling pragmatic or instrumental reason to replace a system of use
rights with a system of fully exclusive property rights: a system of
use rights is extremely epistemically demanding, whilst a system of
property rights is not (Smith 2012: 1702&ndash;1705; Ripstein 2013). A
person typically cannot tell what the first user&rsquo;s
&lsquo;agenda&rsquo; for a thing is just by looking at it. Knowing
whether one&rsquo;s intended use interferes with the first
user&rsquo;s will typically involve a significant inquiry. By
contrast, the rule against trespassing under a property rights system
is a bright line rule: if it is not yours, &lsquo;keep off&rsquo;.
This rule is epistemically very undemanding: the knowledge it requires
is of two kinds: (1) autobiographical (which things have come to be
yours) and (2) what sorts of things are private property as opposed to
common property (e.g., your shoes as opposed to public roads, parks,
and so on), knowledge which is also easily acquired. Where an owner no
longer has a use for something she can transfer it to another by way
of gift or in exchange. Property rights on this account are instituted
to protect use-rights in the most efficient way possible, but at a
cost: uses which would not interfere with a first user&rsquo;s agenda
are ruled out along with the ones which would.</p>

<p>
Finally, we should not forget that not all genealogies set out to
flatter the practices or institutions they purport to explain. Karl
Marx&rsquo;s account of primitive accumulation (1867) and Jean-Jacques
Rousseau&rsquo;s non-normative description of the invention of
property in the <em>Discourse on the Origins of Inequality</em>
(Rousseau 1755) are genealogies written more in a Nietzschean spirit
of pathology than as part of any quest for justification. Such
negative genealogies reminds us of the importance of Mill&rsquo;s
observation that in approaching the justification of private property
we must remember that, &ldquo;we must leave out of consideration its
actual origin in any of the existing nations of Europe&rdquo; (Mill
1848: bk II, ch 1, &sect;1 [1994: 7]).</p>

<h2 id="ProDisJus">5. Property and Distributive Justice</h2>

<p>
Two questions must be distinguished, which might be illustrated by a
pair of examples. Consider a society in which nobles are allowed to
own slaves, but commoners are not. Consider also a society in
which men may vote in Parliamentary elections, but women may not.
Assume in both cases that the restrictive allocation
of these rights is arbitrary and irrational. So these cases are
ones of distributive injustice. How might we deal with this problem?
One solution is to abolish the right entirely, so no one has
it&mdash;no distribution, no distributive injustice. We take it
our readers will agree that this is the correct solution in the
slavery case, but not the voting case. The right to own slaves is not
a good right to have, but the right to vote is. The point is that we
must value the right positively or negatively before dealing with any
issues arising from its distribution. Assuming that one of the
justificatory stories in Parts 3 and 4 works, so that one may conclude
that a property right is a good right to have, we can move to the
second question. In doing so we have to consider the various modes of
distribution that operate on property rights. It is beyond the scope
of this entry to discuss the justification of these modes in detail,
but the parenthetical references provide a good starting point for
inquiry: These modes are:</p>

<p>
<strong>Original or first appropriation</strong>. As a practical
matter, original appropriation is a very minor source of property
rights these days (deep sea fishing is probably the only major
example). Even so, as we saw in Part 4, original appropriation remains
of significant theoretical interest. (Sreenivasan 1995; Sage 2012,
2018; Otsuka 2018; Penner 2018)</p>

<p>
<strong>Government transfer payments</strong>, such as welfare
benefits, unemployment insurance payments, state pension payments.
States may also expropriate and confiscate property, and award damages
in private legal actions, institute insolvency procedures, but these
are not a major factor in the distribution of property, although these
modes obviously raise justice concerns of one kind or another. As to
government transfers, the discourse has largely centred aound the
legitimacy of taxation for &lsquo;redistributive&rsquo; purposes.
(See, e.g., Rawls 1999: ch V, Nozick 1974: ch 7, Bhandari 2017)</p>

<p>
<strong>Inter vivos gifts, inheritance, and bequest</strong>.
Inheritance must be distinguished from bequest. Inheritance is a
regime of succession to property under which the descendants of a
person have an indefeasible right to his or her property on death.
Civilian and Islamic legal regimes of succession are regimes of this
kind. Under these regimes there is no, or very limited, freedom of
testamentary disposition. In contrast, bequests concern postmortem
gifts. These can of course be made to one&rsquo;s descendants and
other dependents, but typically in these regimes testators (the donors
of postmortem gifts) have unrestricted freedom of testamentary
disposition. Though people tend still to use the word
&ldquo;heir&rdquo; in England and other common law jurisdictions,
typically there are no longer, properly speaking, heirs in these
countries. (Beckert 2004 [2008]; Penner 2014; Schmidt am Busch et al
2023.)</p>

<p>
<strong>Contract</strong>. Markets are made up of all the contracts
persons enter into to exchange goods and services. Markets, and their
constitutive contracts, are more or less regulated by law, as with
consumer protection legislation. (Baldwin 1959; Kronman 1980; Gordley
1981, 1991; Buckle 1991; Bar-Gill 2012; Klass et al 2014;
Jim&eacute;nez 2021).</p>

<p>
This mode of distribution is the one which has attracted the most
controversy, and it is right to point out that many of the alleged
market-advantages accrue only if private property is distributed in
certain ways. Monopolistic control of the main factors of production
by a few individuals or corporations can play havoc with market
efficiency, and it can also lead to such great concentrations of
private power as to offset any argument for property based on freedom,
dissent, or democracy. Distributive equity may be crucial also for
nonconsequentialist arguments. The idea that property-owning promotes
virtue is, as we have seen, as old as Aristotle, and even today it is
used by civic republicans as an argument against economic
collectivism. According to this argument, if most economic resources
are owned in common or controlled collectively for everyone&rsquo;s
benefit, there is no guarantee that citizen&rsquo;s conditions of life
will be such as to promote republican virtue. In a communist or
collectivist society, citizens may behave either as passive
beneficiaries of the state or irresponsible participants in a tragedy
of the commons. If a generation or two grow up with that character
then the integrity of the whole society is in danger. These arguments
are interesting, but it is worth noting how sensitive they are to the
distribution of property (Waldron 1988: 323&ndash;42). As T.H. Green
observed, a person who owns nothing in a capitalist society
&ldquo;might as well, in respect of the ethical purposes which the
possession of property should serve, be denied rights of property
altogether&rdquo; (Green 1886/1895: &sect;220 [1895: 219]).</p>

<p>
There is a final question that must be asked: even if the various
modes of distribution do give rise to various distributive injustices,
might not it be better overall not to disturb these modes because
doing so would diminish other gains they might realise? It is beyond
the scope of this entry to consider claims of this sort in detail, but
the following may be said.</p>

<p>
It is surely important to keep in view the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo;
that a system of property presents (Singer 2000 and Purdy 2010). What
overall model of community is generated by a given system of property
rights and by the way they circulate in society? What kinds of
inter-personal relations does a given system of property foster? What
ethos of economic interaction does it give rise to: an obsession with
efficiency, an ethic of competitiveness, or a shared concern for those
who are less well-off? These questions are not distinct from questions
about distribution, but they look at them in a different light, not
just asking about their moral justification one by one.</p>

<p>
Second, one should consider an argument about desert in order to show
that there is justice in some people&rsquo;s enjoying the fruits of
private property even while others languish in poverty. If private
property involves the wiser and more efficient use of resources, it is
because someone has exercised virtues of prudence, industry, and
self-restraint. People who languish in poverty, on this account, do so
largely because of their idleness, profligacy, or want of initiative.
Now, theories like this are easily discredited if they purport to
justify the actual distribution of wealth under an existing private
property economy (Nozick 1974: 158&ndash;9; Hayek 1976). But there is
a more modest position which desert theorists can adopt: namely, that
private property alone offers a system in which idleness is not
rewarded at the expense of industry, a system in which those who take
on the burdens of prudence and productivity can expect to reap some
reward for their virtue which distinguishes them from those who did
not make any such effort (Munzer 1990: 285 ff.).</p>

<p>
Third, we must also consider justificatory arguments that connect
property with liberty. Societies with private property are often
described as free societies. Part of what this means is surely that
owners are free to use their property as they please; they are not
bound by social or political decisions. (And correlatively, the role
of government in economic decision-making is minimized.) But that
cannot be all that is meant, for it would be equally apposite to
describe private property as a system of <em>unfreedom</em>, since it
necessarily involves the social exclusion of people from resources
that others own. All property systems distribute freedoms and
unfreedoms; no system of property can be described without
qualification as a system of liberty. Someone may respond that the
liberty to use what belongs to another is license not liberty, and so
its exclusion should not really count against a private property
system in the libertarian calculus. But the price of this maneuver is
very high: not only does it commit the libertarian to a moralized
conception of freedom of the sort that he usually shies away from (as
in case of positive liberty), but it also means that liberty, so
defined, can no longer be invoked to support property except in a
question-begging way (Cohen 1979).</p>

<p>
Two other things might be implied by the libertarian characterization.
The first is a point about independence: a person who owns a
significant amount of private property&mdash;a home, say, and a source
of income&mdash;has less to fear from the opinion and coercion of
others than the citizen of a society in which some other form of
property predominates. The former inhabits, in a fairly literal sense,
the &lsquo;private sphere&rsquo; that liberals have always treasured
for individuals&mdash;a realm of action in which he need answer to
no-one but himself. But like the virtue argument, this version of the
libertarian case is also sensitive to distribution: for those who own
nothing in a private property economy would seem to be as
unfree&mdash;by this argument&mdash;as anyone would be in a socialist
society.</p>

<p>
That last point may be too quick, however, for there are other
indirect ways in which private property contributes to freedom (Purdy
2005). Milton Friedman (1962) argues that political liberty is
enhanced in a society where the means of intellectual and political
production (printing presses, photocopying machines, computers) are
controlled by a number of private individuals, firms, and
corporations&mdash;even if that number is not very large. In a
capitalist society, a dissident has the choice of dealing with several
people (other than state officials) if he wants to get his message
across, and many of them are prepared to make their media available
simply on the basis of money, without regard to the message. In a
socialist society, by contrast, those who are politically active
either have to persuade state agencies to disseminate their views, or
risk underground publication. More generally, Friedman argues, a
private property society offers those who own nothing a greater
variety of ways in which they earn a living&mdash;a larger menu of
masters, if you like&mdash;than they would be offered in a socialist
society. In these ways, private property for some may make a positive
contribution to freedom&mdash;or at least an enhancement of
choice&mdash;for everyone.</p>

<p>
Finally, in this review of direct normative arguments about property,
we should consider the moral importance property might have in respect
of what it is, rather than what it does or brings about. Property
rights in and of themselves give people a certain status and
recognition in society: a property owner is respected in his or her
control of a resource (Dorfman 2012). This is surely important; it
was, as we saw, one of the themes of the approach taken in Hegel 1820
and in Kant 1797 (see Byrd &amp; Hruschka 2006). But it can have
critical implications for property too, for if property is unevenly
distributed, if inequality is radical and some are more or less
comprehensively bereft of property rights, then acute issues have to
be faced about the uneven distribution of the bases of respect. We
cannot take seriously the good that property rights do in regard to
moral recognition without also considering the inherent harm of
absence of such recognition in the case of those who own nothing.</p>
