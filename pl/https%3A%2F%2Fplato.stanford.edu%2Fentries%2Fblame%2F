<h1>Blame</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Apr 15, 2014; substantive revision Fri Aug 30, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Blame is a common reaction to something of negative normative
significance about someone or their behavior. A paradigm case,
perhaps, would be when one person wrongs another, and the latter
responds with resentment and a verbal rebuke, but of course we also
blame others for their attitudes and characters (Eshleman 2004, Smith
2005, Holroyd 2012). Thus blaming scenarios typically involve a wide
range of inward and outward responses to a wrongful or bad action,
attitude, or character (such responses include: beliefs, desires,
expectations, emotions, sanctions, and so on). In theorizing about
blame, then, philosophers have typically asked two questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Which reactions and interactions constitute blame?</li>

<li>When is it appropriate to respond in these ways?</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is common to approach these questions with a larger theoretical
agenda in mind: for example, in an effort to understand the conditions
of moral responsibility and the nature of freedom. But the questions
are interesting in their own right, especially since blame is such a
common feature of our lives. This entry will critically discuss the
answers that have been offered in response to the above questions
concerning blame, with the aim of shedding some light on blame&rsquo;s
nature, ethics, and significance. (It is blame, rather than praise,
that has received the lion&rsquo;s share of attention from
philosophers in recent years, despite the fact that they are a natural
pair. Though that is perhaps beginning to change&mdash;see King
2023, Lippert-Rasmussen 2024, and Shoemaker 2024 for book-length
treatments of blame that also pay serious attention to praise.)</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="WhaBla">1. What is Blame?</h2>

<p>
To begin, note that almost all philosophical discussions of blame
ignore (or mention only to set aside) the form of blame sometimes
characterized as causal or explanatory responsibility (Kenner 1967;
Hart 1968; Beardsley 1969). It is this notion of blame that is at
stake when we say that a hurricane is to blame for the destruction of
a city&rsquo;s harbor, or that the cat is to blame for knocking over
the vase. Theorists contrast this sense of &ldquo;blame&rdquo; with
the sort of <em>interpersonal</em> blame that, for example, one gives
up when one forgives. (As Pamela Hieronymi (2001) has pointed out,
forgiveness in fact requires <em>not</em> giving up one&rsquo;s
judgment that the other person is <em>explanatorily</em> to blame.)
But just what the relation is between causal blame and interpersonal
blame is an important question that has not been well-explored (though
see Chislenko 2021). Nevertheless, in this entry the focus will be on
the latter form of blame, which is a response to moral agents on the
basis of their wrong, bad, or otherwise objectionable actions,
attitudes, or characters.</p>

<p>
Theories of blame could be organized in a number of different ways,
depending on one&rsquo;s purposes. Any scheme for categorizing
theories has its advantages and disadvantages, and by selecting one
scheme over the other, one necessarily emphasizes certain aspects of
blame while ignoring other aspects of blame that might be equally
important. Nevertheless, the taxonomy to follow is consonant with much
of the literature in classifying theories according to the activity or
mental state that is thought to constitute (or at least make up the
primary component of) blame. According to this way of carving things
up, we get four categories: cognitive, emotional, conative, and
functional accounts of blame.</p>

<h3 id="CogTheBla">1.1 Cognitive Theories of Blame</h3>

<p>
Cognitive theories of blame hold that blame is fundamentally a
judgment or evaluation that we make about an agent in light of their
actions, attitudes, or character. One of the earliest cognitive
theories of blame is due to J. J. C. Smart (1961), who develops his
analysis of blame indirectly, since he begins by distinguishing
between praise and <em>dispraise</em> (rather than with the more
natural distinction between praise and blame). According to Smart, to
praise or dispraise an individual is simply to <em>grade</em> them as
a member of a particular kind. And as Smart says, this sort of grading
is no different than the sort of grading involved in judging one apple
to be better than the others at the supermarket. Crucially, Smart
notes that though you might dispraise a young philosopher for their
poor writing in a letter of recommendation, you are not thereby
blaming them for it. Thus for Smart, blame is distinct from dispraise.
Unlike dispraise, blame involves more than merely grading
someone&rsquo;s actions or character (morally), since blame carries
with it the implication that the person is responsible for their
action or character. Blame, then, is a negative evaluative judgment
that implies responsibility.</p>

<p>
In a similar vein, Gary Watson (1996) has suggested that there is an
evaluative form of blame connected with what he calls the
&ldquo;aretaic perspective&rdquo;. To blame someone in this way is to
judge that they have failed with respect to some standard of
excellence (<em>aret&eacute;</em>). It is also to insist that the
agent is responsible for their action in the sense that the action is
<em>attributable</em> to the agent&mdash;it represents their
evaluative standpoint, their practical identity, what they
&ldquo;stand for&rdquo; (Watson 1996: 234). Like Smart, Watson
recognizes that it is possible to make such a judgment
dispassionately. Thus, on the grading and evaluative theories of blame
developed by Smart and Watson, there is nothing about blame that
requires a blamer to be emotionally exercised in any way. However,
unlike Smart&mdash;who <em>identifies</em> blame with a form of
grading that implies moral responsibility&mdash;Watson does not take
aretaic blame to be a general <em>analysis</em> of blame. Rather, for
Watson, aretaic blame is just one way among many that we blame others
for their actions.</p>

<p>
Even though many have resisted thinking of blame as a form of grading,
a number of contemporary accounts of blame retain the core idea in
Smart&rsquo;s (and Watson&rsquo;s) account that blame is a kind of
evaluative judgment. But what sort of evaluative judgment will do?
Many theorists have identified blame with judgments that essentially
implicate how the blamed agent&rsquo;s <em>moral</em> or
<em>practical</em> self was involved in the production of action. This
allows cognitive theories to explain the special force of blame. After
all, as T.M. Scanlon puts it, &ldquo;given that most people care
about&rdquo; their moral selves (and others&rsquo; opinions about
their moral selves), judgments that implicate these aspects of a
person are not &ldquo;<em>mere</em> descriptions&rdquo; (Scanlon 1986:
170). Michael Zimmerman (1988) and Ishtiyaque Haji (1998) make this
point vividly when they argue that to blame someone is to judge that
in virtue of their attitudes, actions, or character, they have a
<em>stain</em> on their moral self or a mark against their moral
ledger. As Zimmerman puts it, when we blame someone, we judge</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that there is a &ldquo;discredit&rdquo; or &ldquo;debit&rdquo; in his
ledger &hellip; that his &ldquo;moral standing&rdquo; has been
&ldquo;diminished&rdquo; (Zimmerman 1988: 38).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One need not endorse the idea of an actual moral ledger in order to
hold a cognitive theory of blame. Pamela Hieronymi (2004), for
example, articulates a cognitive account of blame, where the judgment
in question is a judgment that the blamed agent has shown the blamer
(or another) ill will. Since we care deeply about other people&rsquo;s
judgments about the quality of our wills, this judgment can also carry
the distinctive force of blame.</p>

<p>
One potential problem for cognitive accounts is that they risk
conflating <em>blaming</em> with <em>judging blameworthy</em> (Kenner
1967; Coates and Tognazzini 2012). After all, it seems quite possible
to judge, for example, that another has displayed ill will or that
they have a mark against their moral ledger (and so, judge that they
are blameworthy), without actually blaming them. The
co-conspirator&rsquo;s recognition of the wrongness of a
partner&rsquo;s criminal activity might, in fact, underlie admiration
for the partner&rsquo;s skillful execution of a heinous crime that
most of us couldn&rsquo;t stomach. The fact that the same judgment
could elicit such different responses (repulsion and resentment in
those of us who are committed to the values of morality and admiration
in those who are not) suggests that the judgment alone cannot
constitute blame. More recently, Hanna Pickard (2013) has argued that
since it is possible to knowingly blame others inappropriately (i.e.,
to blame others even when we know that they are not really blameworthy
for their actions), the judgment that another is blameworthy, or that
they have shown ill will or disregard, is not necessary for blame. It
looks, then, that judgments of the sort discussed above are neither
necessary nor sufficient for blame.</p>

<p>
A further problem for cognitive accounts is one suggested by Gary
Watson (1987). According to Watson, attempts to identify or reduce
blame <em>exclusively</em> to its cognitive components (recall that
although Watson thinks that aretaic blame takes the form of judgments,
it does not exhaust the phenomenon of blaming) make it seem</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
as though in blaming we were mainly moral clerks, recording moral
faults &hellip; from a detached and austerely &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
standpoint (1987 as reprinted in Watson 2004: 226&ndash;27).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Watson argues that blame issues from the perspective of a
participant in human relationships, one in which we are not merely
observing the moral order but are actively involved in a moral
community. These sorts of considerations form the basis for emotional
theories of blame.</p>

<h3 id="EmoTheBla">1.2 Emotional Theories of Blame</h3>

<p>
Despite the fact that P. F. Strawson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freedom and
Resentment&rdquo; (1962) contains little sustained discussion of blame
as such, many take it to be the contemporary genesis of emotional
theories of blame. According to Strawson, our status as morally
responsible agents is grounded in the non-detached attitudes and
emotions that are (in part) constitutive of ordinary interpersonal
relationships. Regarding others as morally responsible agents, for
Strawson, is not a matter of judgment but of emotional response.</p>

<p>
R. Jay Wallace (1994) has developed this idea into an account of
&ldquo;holding responsible&rdquo; according to which we hold others
morally responsible just in case we experience resentment,
indignation, or (in the self-regarding case) guilt as a response to
their actions, or judge that such a response would be appropriate.
Thus, for Wallace, (a specific subset of) Strawson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;reactive attitudes&rdquo; are essentially implicated in the
stance we take up when we hold others responsible. But though it is
possible to take up the stance of &ldquo;holding responsible&rdquo;
without being emotionally exercised, Wallace stresses (and reiterates
this in Wallace 2011) that to actually <em>blame</em> an agent, one
must be exercised emotionally.</p>

<p>
Of course, Strawson and Wallace are hardly alone in endorsing
emotional theories of blame. While these &ldquo;Strawsonian&rdquo;
accounts of blame focus on the reactive attitudes (particularly
resentment, indignation, and guilt), other emotional theories of blame
are more inclusive. Susan Wolf (2011), David Shoemaker (2015, 2017),
and Leonhard Menges (2017), for example, defend accounts of blame that
emphasize anger. Similarly, Macalester Bell (2013a, 2013b) argues for
a &ldquo;hostile attitudes&rdquo; account of blame that includes the
attitude of contempt as a blaming attitude. And Douglas Portmore
(2022) offers an account that emphasizes the feeling of disappointment
or disapproval. Consequently, what holds emotional theories of blame
together is not widespread agreement over which emotions constitute
blame. Rather, it is a shared commitment to thinking that to blame is
to respond to others&rsquo; actions with a negative emotion.</p>

<p>
Though it&rsquo;s very plausible that we blame others by responding to
their actions with anger, resentment, indignation, or even contempt,
there are a number of objections to emotional theories of blame.
George Sher (2006) argues that emotional responses are unnecessary for
blame. For example, Sher argues that we can blame a loved one without
feeling negative emotional reactions. So too, we can blame villains
from whom we are temporally distant without any emotional response.
The thought here is simply that it is possible to blame Nero for the
burning of Rome, even though we do not feel any resentment or
indignation towards Nero for his cruelty. In response, defenders of
emotional theories might simply argue that despite appearances,
without the emotions, one is simply not blaming Nero but instead
merely judging blameworthy (see Wallace 1994, 2011). Alternatively, a
defender of emotional theories could argue (plausibly, but by no means
uncontroversially) that one can be in an emotional state even if one
does not experience any felt affect.</p>

<p>
A second objection to emotional theories of blame might be called the
&ldquo;force objection&rdquo;. Pamela Hieronymi develops this
objection by noting that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
an affective accompaniment of a judgment would be a certain unpleasant
emotional disturbance &hellip; but, the force of blame seems deeper,
more serious or weightier (Hieronymi 2004: 121).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, in Hieronymi&rsquo;s view, the normative force of blame must be
grounded in the cognitive elements of blaming emotions, since it is
these elements that are responsive to and reflect our concern for
morality. But if the force of blame is grounded in the cognitive
elements of the emotion, then why wouldn&rsquo;t a judgment with the
same content constitute an instance of blame? It seems that while
emotions might be concomitant with blame, it is the cognitive
element&mdash;one that can be present even if the blamer is not
emotionally exercised&mdash;and not the emotion itself that
constitutes one&rsquo;s blame. In response to this sort of objection,
Wallace (2011) has argued that the reactive emotions are not
superfluous add-ons to the judgment, but instead they serve to change
the meaning of the judgment, imbuing the judgment with the sort of
expressive significance that is characteristic of blame and that would
otherwise be lacking from a mere judgment. (See also Reis-Dennis 2019
on the meaning and function of moral anger.)</p>

<p>
More recently, Miranda Fricker (2016) has argued that our blaming
practices evince too much internal diversity to be so neatly
identified with the narrow set of attitudes that emotion theorists
focus on. Because blame in one context can vary so significantly from
blame in another context&mdash;self-blame is different than direct
second-personal blame, and each of these forms of blame is importantly
different than third-party blame&mdash;there is very little that is
present in all instances of blame. And surely no specific emotional
experience will be present in all cases. In response to this, Leonhard
Menges (2017) has claimed that there is actually less diversity in our
blaming practices than Fricker supposes, and that to the degree there
is any diversity in how we blame, it does nothing to undermine the
rationale for emotional accounts of blame.</p>

<h3 id="ConTheBla">1.3 Conative Theories of Blame</h3>

<p>
Conative theories of blame emphasize motivational elements, like
desires and intentions, as essential to blame. Two of the most
developed extant theories of blame&mdash;those due to George Sher
(2006) and T. M. Scanlon (2008, 2013)&mdash;fall in this category. And
though we will focus on these two theories, other conative theories
are possible (see, for example, Bern&aacute;th 2020).</p>

<h4 id="DisAroBelDesPai">1.3.1 Dispositions Around a Belief-Desire Pair</h4>

<p>
As mentioned above, George Sher (2006) is skeptical of emotional
theories of blame. However, he is also skeptical about accounts of
blame that are merely cognitive. There is more to blame than a mere
judgment that an agent has acted wrongly, but one need not be
emotionally exercised in order to blame. Sher prefers a happy medium
between these two widely accepted alternatives.</p>

<p>
According to Sher, what must be added to judgments of wrongness is a
backwards-looking desire &ldquo;that the person in question not have
performed his past bad act&rdquo; (2006: 112). But it&rsquo;s not
enough that the blamer simply wish that the bad action not have
happened; the desire must be one that issues from the blamer&rsquo;s
general commitment to morality, since what we really want is that the
wrongdoer not have &ldquo;exercised his own decision-making capacities
in a certain way&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;he have responded, or that he
be disposed to respond, to what we consider a compelling moral
reason&rdquo; (2006: 105). On the resulting view, when the cognitive
component of judging blameworthy is accompanied by this desire, which
reflects our general commitment to morality, then we are blaming. (See
also Arpaly 2006 and Arpaly &amp; Schroeder 2014 for a similar view,
according to which blame requires having a conative orientation
&ldquo;against the wrong or bad&rdquo; (Arpaly &amp; Schroeder 2014:
161).) Moreover, Sher argues that the belief-desire pair in question
is itself the basis of those affective and behavioral dispositions
that are commonly associated with blame. For example, a blamer&rsquo;s
disposition to feel hostile attitudes like anger towards the agent and
to also reprimand, rebuke, and seek apology are to be explained by the
presence of the belief-desire pair.</p>

<p>
Despite the elegance of Sher&rsquo;s view, it has generated a number
of critical replies. Pamela Hieronymi (2008) objects to the link
between the belief-desire pair and attendant affective and behavioral
dispositions. To her mind, the link is too weak: though she accepts
Sher&rsquo;s claim that the belief-desire pair is essentially
implicated in one&rsquo;s general commitment to morality, she does not
think he has adequately shown that the characteristic dispositions are
implicated in the same way. After all, &ldquo;surely our commitment to
morality could be affirmed or clarified in ways that do not involve
hostile behavior or reproach&rdquo; (2008: 25). But if this is
correct, then it looks like blame&rsquo;s characteristic dispositions
need not be present, even in those who are genuinely and sincerely
committed to moral norms. As a result, Hieronymi concludes that Sher
has failed to show that <em>blame</em>&mdash;which must involve such
dispositions&mdash;is essentially tied to a more general commitment to
morality.</p>

<p>
A second objection to Sher&rsquo;s view is due to Angela Smith (2008),
who rejects Sher&rsquo;s claim that a desire component is part of what
constitutes an attitude as blame. To defend this, she invites us to
consider an ordinary case of blame, say the blame we feel for a
politician who leads us into a disastrous war. While we no doubt
desire that the politician hadn&rsquo;t led us into the war because we
are generally committed to morality (and we therefore don&rsquo;t
enjoy the suffering of innocents), it is not clear how this desire is
itself part of our blame. By Smith&rsquo;s lights, the desire
component of the belief-desire pair, like the attendant affective and
behavioral dispositions, seems to be something that is above and
beyond blame itself. In more recent work, Smith has also argued that
in some cases, say in &ldquo;the reactions of a mother whose son is
blameworthy for [a] crime&rdquo; (Smith 2013: 35), the relevant
belief-desire pair might be present without blame. Another challenge
to Sher&rsquo;s theory is that it is too &ldquo;sanitized&rdquo; or
&ldquo;whitewashed&rdquo; to do justice to our actual practice (McGeer
2013, Chislenko forthcoming).</p>

<h4 id="AttAdjResImp">1.3.2 Attitude Adjustment in Response to Impairment</h4>

<p>
T. M. Scanlon (2008) has developed an influential account of blame
that represents something of a shift from his earlier, more cognitive,
account (see Scanlon 1986). In developing this new account,
Scanlon&rsquo;s initial motivation is similar to that of Sher, since
Scanlon thinks that an adequate account of blame must fit somewhere
between a mere <em>judgment</em> that another has acted in some
objectionable way and a <em>sanction</em> (of which expressed reactive
emotions are but one paradigm case).</p>

<p>
For Scanlon, the cognitive component of blame is provided by a
judgment that another has acted in a way that impairs meaningful
interpersonal relations; this is a judgment of blameworthiness. But
this judgment itself is insufficient for blame (for reasons similar to
those that Sher gives), so in addition to judging that the agent is
blame<em>worthy</em>, blame requires you &ldquo;to take your
relationship with him or her to be modified in a way that [a judgment
of blameworthiness] holds to be appropriate&rdquo; (Scanlon 2008:
128&ndash;29). In other words, blaming someone involves not just the
belief that they have acted in a way that impairs your relationship
with them, but also, that you take yourself to have reasons to revise
your intentions and attitudes towards them, and accordingly that you
revise these intentions and attitudes on the basis of such
reasons.</p>

<p>
Like Sher, then, Scanlon has provided an initially plausible account
of what it is to blame. But also like Sher, his account has been
widely criticized. The most common line of criticism is best summed up
by R. Jay Wallace&rsquo;s (2011) slogan that Scanlon&rsquo;s account
&ldquo;leaves the blame out of blame&rdquo;. More precisely, Wallace
argues that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
blame has a quality of opprobrium that is not captured by the
considerations about the normative significance of impaired
relationships that are at the center of Scanlon&rsquo;s approach
(Wallace 2011: 349; see also Mason 2011).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Susan Wolf (2011) has also argued that in some cases, such as the case
of a hot-headed but ultimately loving family, it seems that you can
blame another without taking yourself to have impairments in your
relationship or attendant reasons to revise your intentions or
attitudes towards that person. The characteristic features of
Scanlon&rsquo;s interpretation of blame, then, seem to be unnecessary.
Finally, Sher (2013) has argued that Scanlon&rsquo;s emphasis on
relationships is problematic. After all, many cases of wrongdoing
involve strangers&mdash;e.g., in most car thefts, the victim does not
know the criminal. Nevertheless, it still seems that it is possible to
blame those with whom we have no standing relationship. So blame
cannot essentially implicate interpersonal relationships. Scanlon, in
response (2008, 2013), insists that all rational agents stand in the
&ldquo;moral relationship&rdquo; to one another. However, whether this
kind of relationship is sufficient to explain the blame of strangers
is unclear. And indeed, as Sher points out, even if there is some
relationship between a victim and the stranger who victimizes them,
it&rsquo;s not clear that <em>this</em> relationship plays any role at
all in grounding the blame. (For recent discussion of Scanlon&rsquo;s
account, see Chislenko 2020 and Sars 2023.) </p>

<h3 id="FunTheBla">1.4 Functional Theories of Blame</h3>

<p>
In light of the above difficulties, perhaps we should conclude that
there simply is no single type of mental state or attitude that is
constitutive of blame. One way to go here would be to abandon the
project of analyzing blame altogether (Nussbaum 2016). A second way to
go would be to argue that blame is a disposition that can manifest in
many different ways depending on the context (Werkm&auml;ster 2022).
In recent years, however, many authors have taken a third path, which
is to develop a functional account of blame, according to which blame
is to be identified by its functional role, rather than by any
particular attitude or combination of attitudes.</p>

<p>
According to one functional account of blame, the function of blame is
protest. In other words, what we&rsquo;re doing when we blame others
is protesting their actions, attitudes, or character. But this, of
course, means that any number of attitudes or combination of attitudes
could be present in blame. Pamela Hieronymi (2001), Matthew Talbert
(2012), and Victoria McGeer (2013) argue that reactive attitudes like
resentment (and the expressions of these attitudes) serve as powerful
forms of protest. Angela Smith (2013), on the other hand, argues that
when we modify our attitudes and intentions as Scanlon envisions, but
do so <em>as a form of protest</em>, then we are actually blaming. In
other words, for Smith, it&rsquo;s not enough that we modify our
attitudes and intentions; the modification in question must serve a
particular function, namely that of protest, to count as an instance
of blame. And in order to count as a protest, it need not involve any
particular emotional state. (See also Pereboom 2021, which develops a
forward-looking account of blame based on the idea of moral protest,
which does not involve retributive emotions.)</p>

<p>
There are at least two sources of concern for those theories that take
protest to be the function of blame. First, it&rsquo;s not clear that
protest is independent of blame, such that one could specify what it
is to protest without appealing to blaming attitudes. But if this is
so, it&rsquo;s not clear that appealing to the notion of protest will
help us clarify the nature of blame. Second, protest seems
paradigmatically <em>expressed</em>. Indeed, it&rsquo;s hard to make
sense of unexpressed protest. Do workers protest unfair labor
conditions simply through their beliefs or attitudes? Or must they
make such beliefs and attitudes known? And if it is the latter, then
it&rsquo;s not clear that protest could be the function of blame.
After all, not all blame is expressed. These objections are not
decisive, of course, but they do suggest that there is more work to be
done in defense of protest views to help us better understand what the
nature of protest is, such that appeals to protest can provide a
non-circular account of blame. (See Chislenko 2019 for a discussion of
these objections and other aspects of the moral protest account of
blame.)</p>

<p>
Of course, there might be other functions of blame: to express or
communicate condemnation, disapproval, demands, or expectations (Duff
1986, Macnamara 2011, 2015, McKenna 2012, Bennett 2013, Fricker 2016,
Mason 2019), or to stand up for our values (Houston 1992, Franklin
2013), or to signal the blamer&rsquo;s normative commitments
(Shoemaker and Vargas 2019), or to &ldquo;facilitate shared
knowledge&rdquo; about the ways that wrongdoing changes the normative
landscape (Sliwa 2019). (On the structure of functionalist accounts in
general, see Wang forthcoming.)</p>

<p>
One potential problem with views that emphasize communication is that
many instances of blame are not expressed or communicated. So, in what
sense are those instances of blame communicative? And if they are not,
how can blame be essentially communicative in its nature? (Jefferson
2024 contains a discussion of whether and how it makes sense to blame
the dead, on this sort of account.) Gary Watson suggests that
resentment is &ldquo;incipiently communicative&rdquo; and says that
&ldquo;in some elusive sense, resentment is &lsquo;meant to be
expressed&rsquo;&rdquo; (Watson 2011: 328). That sense remains elusive
(see Telech 2020 and Wang 2021 for recent discussion).</p>

<h2 id="WheBlaApp">2. When is Blame Appropriate?</h2>

<p>
Blame is easily abused and misused, so a complete understanding of the
phenomenon will require looking not just at what blame <em>is</em> but
also <em>when it&rsquo;s appropriate</em>. (We use
&lsquo;appropriate&rsquo; as a broad normative term to cover all sorts
of evaluations, such as whether any particular instance of blame is
fitting, warranted, permissible, required, effective, and so on.) As
Miranda Fricker puts it: &ldquo;Like most things in life, our practice
of blame is susceptible to the vices of being done from the wrong sort
of motive, in the wrong degree, in the wrong way, or with the wrong
sort of object&rdquo; (Fricker 2016: 168). This list provides a nice
initial taxonomy of ways that blame can go awry: an ethics of blame
will need to take into consideration (a) facts about the blamer, (b)
facts about the blaming interaction itself, and (c) facts about the
person being blamed. (See Coates 2020 for a detailed outline of the
various issues that might come up when exploring the ethics of
blame.)</p>

<p>
Keep in mind, too, that how you answer the question of what blame
<em>is</em> will influence these ethical questions, since the
propriety conditions of a judgment are plausibly distinct from the
propriety conditions of a rebuke. Because we are not here endorsing a
particular theory of blame, our characterization of the norms in
question will operate at a level of abstraction that floats free of
substantive commitments concerning the nature of blame. (It&rsquo;s
also worth noting that the conditions on appropriate blame outlined
below may perhaps be legitimately ignored if the stakes are high
enough and the likely consequences of blame so valuable. In other
words, there may be cases where it is appropriate to blame for the
&lsquo;wrong&rsquo; sort of reason. We set these cases aside for the
purposes of our discussion, though see Calhoun 1989, Ciurria 2019, and
Edlich 2022.)</p>

<h3 id="FacAboPerBeiBla">2.1 Facts about the Person Being Blamed</h3>

<p>
Begin by considering potentially relevant facts about the person who
is being blamed. A natural answer to the question of when blame is
appropriate is to say that blame is only appropriate when the person
blamed is in fact blame<em>worthy</em>. This may sound at first like
an unhelpful tautology&mdash;after all, what could it mean to be
worthy of blame if not simply that you can be appropriately
blamed?&mdash;but the emphasis on <em>worthiness</em> is meant to draw
attention to the fact that it&rsquo;s only appropriate to blame a
person when they have <em>earned</em> it or when they <em>deserve</em>
it. That is, only when certain facts about <em>the person being
blamed</em> are in place. Which facts? What does one have to do to
earn blame?</p>

<h4 id="MorAge">2.1.1 Moral Agency</h4>

<p>
As we noted in section 1 above, being <em>to blame</em> (i.e.,
causally responsible; see Beardsley 1969 and Kenner 1967) is not
sufficient for being <em>blameworthy</em> because often, the best or
most salient causal explanation doesn&rsquo;t even involve a moral
agent at all. Earthquakes and mosquitoes can be to blame for various
negative outcomes, but neither can be blameworthy because neither can,
as Gary Watson puts it, &ldquo;act effectively and competently in
moral matters&rdquo; (2013: 3322). Only certain creatures are even
candidates for blame in the first place, and though it is a matter of
some controversy which precise capacities are required, the list
certainly includes the capacities for reflection, deliberation,
decision-making, and self-determination. But earthquakes and
mosquitoes are the easy cases; the harder cases are children and
psychopaths, individuals who haven&rsquo;t (or haven&rsquo;t yet)
developed an understanding of or an appreciation for moral norms.
These individuals, it seems, can still act in morally significant
ways&mdash;indeed, in ways we would naturally describe as cruel and
even evil&mdash;but whether they can earn moral blame (as opposed
merely to giving us good reason to protect ourselves from them) is a
vexed question (see Watson 2011, 2024, Shoemaker 2015, and Nelkin 2015
for insightful discussion). But regardless of how one answers that
question, it is widely accepted that potentially blameworthy agents
must be capable of reflecting upon, reasoning about, and executing a
decision about how to behave. If someone lacks these capacities, they
are <em>exempted</em> from blame.</p>

<h4 id="FreRes">2.1.2 Freedom and Responsibility</h4>

<p>
In addition to having the general capacity for practical reasoning,
however, it is often thought that an individual is appropriately
blamed only if they had (and, on the occasion, exercised) free will.
The excuse &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was
forced to do it&rdquo; is often sufficient to render blame
inappropriate, so it&rsquo;s a natural thought that someone can only
be blamed for those things that they <em>could</em> have helped, or
<em>weren&rsquo;t</em> forced into&mdash;in other words, for those
things that they chose of their own free will. (But note that this is
primarily a condition applied to <em>actions</em> for which one is
thought to be blameworthy. Taking seriously the possibility that we
can be blameworthy for our attitudes as well might naturally lead one
to downplay the importance of free will, or reconceive what it
involves. See, for example, Smith 2005.) Typically, free will is
thought of as a sort of <em>control</em>: as the ability to control
(by selecting) which of two possible futures obtains, for example, or
as the ability to control (by guiding) one&rsquo;s actions in light of
one&rsquo;s considered judgments about what one ought to do. (See van
Inwagen 1983; Fischer 1994; Nelkin 2011; Franklin 2018.) The question
of whether control of the right sort is compatible with determinism
has proven to be a difficult one to answer; hence it&rsquo;s a
difficult question whether blame would ever be appropriate in a
deterministic world. There are less sweeping threats to freedom,
however. We are all vulnerable to coercion, manipulation, situational
pressures, and varying degrees of temptation or compulsion, and the
extent to which these factors rob us of our freedom is the extent to
which we may not be deserving of blame.</p>

<p>
If you add the capacity for practical reasoning to the right sort of
capacities for control (which will likely include not just volitional
capacities but cognitive capacities, too), you end up with a morally
responsible agent&mdash;that is to say, an individual who has the
capacities that render them a sensible target of blame (see Fischer
&amp; Ravizza 1998; Vargas 2013). If, in performing a morally
reprehensible action, they exercise those capacities, then they are
morally responsible <em>for</em> that action&mdash;that is to say,
they are a sensible target of blame for that action (they are neither
exempted nor excused from our blaming practices).</p>

<p>
There are further subtleties here, but they are inessential to the
main point, which is simply that most theorists think that it is only
appropriate to blame someone if they have certain capacities for
control, practical reasoning, moral understanding, etc., and exercised
them on the occasion in question. (One of the subtleties is that even
if an agent satisfies all the relevant control conditions, they may
still fail to be responsible if they fail to meet an independent
epistemic condition. Non-culpable ignorance (perhaps even culpable
ignorance) of the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions seems to excuse
bad behavior as much as lack of control. See Ginet 2000, Mele 2011,
and Robichaud &amp; Wieland 2017.) Likewise, most theorists think that
if someone has and exercises these capacities, then they are
blameworthy&mdash;that is, they have <em>earned</em> blame. (See
McCormick 2022 for a recent discussion of whether blame can ever be
deserved.) But just because someone has earned blame doesn&rsquo;t
mean that blame is necessarily the right response. To see why,
let&rsquo;s turn now to facts about the blaming interaction
itself.</p>

<h3 id="FacAboBlaInt">2.2 Facts about the Blaming Interaction</h3>

<p>
Even if someone is blameworthy, not just <em>any</em> blaming
interaction is called for. If we think of blame as a
&ldquo;move&rdquo; made through moral space, or as a contribution to a
moral conversation (McKenna 2012), then one dimension of normative
questions will concern the moves or messages that are called for. We
might think of these as <em>procedural</em> norms (Coates and
Tognazzini 2012).</p>

<h4 id="Pro">2.2.1 Proportionality</h4>

<p>
Analogous to the common thought that the punishment must fit the
crime, it is plausible to suppose that the blame must, in some sense,
fit the transgression. Perhaps it&rsquo;s legitimate to be annoyed at
your friend for forgetting your birthday one year, but you
shouldn&rsquo;t (at least in the absence of some special context) vow
never to speak to them again as a result of that one lapse. What will
count as a proportional blaming response to a transgression will no
doubt vary with different relationships and different transgressions,
but there will likely always be some responses that take the
transgression too seriously, and some that don&rsquo;t take it
seriously enough.</p>

<p>
What counts as a proportional blaming response won&rsquo;t depend just
on the nature of the transgression, though; it will likely also depend
on the way the wrongdoer has responded to their own transgression. As
Angela Smith puts it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If someone has an objectionable attitude toward me, for example, but
is already reproaching herself for it and making efforts to change,
then I may judge that I have no reason to adopt or express any blaming
attitudes toward her at all. Her own self-reproach shows me that she
already recognizes that I have moral standing and deserve better
treatment, and therefore I may no longer see her attitude as posing a
challenge to me or my status. In cases of this sort, the faulty
attitude is still attributable to the agent and she is open to
legitimate moral criticism for it; but the agent is already responding
appropriately to this fact and therefore there may be no grounds for
further criticism on the part of others (Smith 2007: 482).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Relatedly, in the case of third-party blame&mdash;where your blame is
directed at someone who has wronged someone else&mdash;there are
procedural questions concerning how the intensity of your blame
matches up with the intensity of the blame from the person who was
wronged. If I suspect that your failure to blame someone who has
wronged you stems from a lack of self-respect or a lack of feeling
empowered, then perhaps I can appropriately be more outraged than you
are. But in other cases it seems as though I need to temper my blame
in light of how you yourself view the wrong that has been done to you.
For example, what if you have forgiven the wrongdoer? Does that by
itself render third-party blame out of order? Maura Priest (2016)
suggests that we distinguish between &ldquo;Spectator Blame&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Associate Blame&rdquo; to help deal with this issue. While
forgiveness might render blaming <em>on behalf of the victim</em>
inappropriate, there is still a more detached form of blame that could
be appropriately maintained.</p>

<h4 id="EpiCon">2.2.2 Epistemic Considerations</h4>

<p>
Imaginary philosophical examples are always told by an omniscient
narrator, but of course real-life cases of blame are never like that,
and we have to rely on our fallible judgments about the obscure
motivations of other human beings. Sometimes we are confident that
someone has done wrong; other times we let our anger hamper our
imagination and our generosity in searching for possible excuses for
apparent wrongdoing. Having too quick a temper is itself something for
which one can be open to criticism, and what makes a temper count as
<em>too</em> quick is often that it outstrips the evidence for
wrongdoing. The realm of interpersonal blame is not perfectly
analogous to the realm of legal responsibility, of course, so
&ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; may be too demanding a
requirement, but nevertheless there is some epistemic standard that
must be met before blame is appropriate, even if the potential target
of blame is in fact blameworthy. (This point is developed in more
detail in Coates 2016. See also Rosen 2004.)</p>

<h3 id="FacAboBla">2.3 Facts about the Blamer</h3>

<p>
Even if some agent is blameworthy, and even if no procedural norm
would be violated, it&rsquo;s not the case (or, at least, not
<em>always</em> the case) that everyone can blame. As Roger Wertheimer
points out,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
some matters&mdash;like other folks&rsquo; intimate intrafamilial
relations&mdash;may be none of your business, not your affair, no
(proper) concern of yours, so, whatever your evidence and emotions, it
is not your place to bear ill will (Wertheimer 1998: 499).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
G. A. Cohen echoes the sentiment from a different perspective:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Moral] admonition may be sound, and in place, but some may be poorly
placed to offer it. When a person replies to a critic by saying:
&ldquo;Where do <em>you</em> get off criticizing <em>me</em> for
<em>that</em>?&rdquo;, she is not denying (or, of course, affirming)
the inherent soundness of the critic&rsquo;s criticism. She is denying
her critic&rsquo;s right to make that criticism, in a posture of
judgment (Cohen 2006: 118).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The general idea here is that there may be facts about the person who
is expressing blame that make their blame inappropriate. It&rsquo;s
not their place, they aren&rsquo;t well positioned, they don&rsquo;t
have the authority, and so on. Marilyn Friedman (2013: 272) puts the
point nicely by saying that not everyone is <em>blamer</em>worthy. To
continue with the legal analogy from above: whereas the blaming
interaction raises questions of <em>procedure</em>, we might think of
facts about the blamer as giving rise to questions about
<em>jurisdiction</em>. Granted that the wrongdoer is blameworthy and
that the blaming procedures would be in order, who exactly can enact
those procedures?</p>

<h4 id="Sta">2.3.1 Standing</h4>

<p>
There has recently been an explosion of work on the so-called
<em>standing to blame</em>, which is often taken to be the primary
fact about the blamer that is relevant to whether an instance of blame
is appropriate. Hypocritical blame is usually treated as a paradigm
example, and the most basic thought is simply that there seems to be
something inappropriate about blame issued by a blamer who is guilty
of the same (or similar) transgression to which they are reacting. The
standard way of talking about what&rsquo;s going wrong in this sort of
case is to use the label &lsquo;standing&rsquo;: the hypocritical
blamer lacks the standing to blame.</p>

<p>
Not everyone who writes about standing uses the term in the same way,
perhaps in part because there are several interesting philosophical
issues in this neighborhood that are not always clearly distinguished.
The literature has grown up around the issue of hypocritical blame,
which is widely thought to be inappropriate in some way. But there are
multiple ways in which it might be inappropriate, and it&rsquo;s not
clear that the language of &lsquo;standing&rsquo; is helpfully applied
to them all. For example, the hypocritical blamer may well be making a
moral mistake, but that may be a separate issue from the question of
whether and why the person being hypocritically blamed can
legitimately ignore or dismiss that blame. Hypocritical blame may be
inappropriate in the sense of &lsquo;morally wrong&rsquo; and also
inappropriate in the sense of &lsquo;legitimately dismissable&rsquo;,
but those seem to be separate senses, which may have independent
explanations. (And of course there may be other ways in which
hypocritical blame is inappropriate.)</p>

<p>
Moreover, worries about standing seem to apply beyond questions of
hypocrisy to other blamer-based worries, such as whether the blamer is
complicit in the wrongdoing or meddling in someone else&rsquo;s
business. So it would be a mistake, from a methodological point of
view, to wed the concept of standing too closely to the specific
issues that arise in cases of hypocritical blame. Perhaps what goes
wrong in hypocritical blame is the same sort of thing as what goes
wrong in meddlesome blame, but best to leave the &ldquo;perhaps
not&rdquo; option on the table as well.</p>

<p>
In light of the risk of terminological confusion, perhaps the best way
forward is to follow Linda Radzik (2023) and opt for a
&ldquo;minimal&rdquo; understanding of standing, according to which it
is simply a matter of <em>eligibility</em>. Just as there are facts
about the person being blamed that make them eligible for blame in the
first place &ndash; moral agency, normative competence, and so on &ndash; so
there are facts about the blamer that make them eligible to blame in
the first place. This minimal concept of standing leaves open (as it
should) questions about, for example, the criteria for eligibility or
the precise normative status(es) that eligibility confers.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are some who have expressed
skepticism about the very idea of standing. But what these theorists
are skeptical about is not the minimal idea of eligibility to blame.
Instead, they have expressed doubts about whether it is wise to
dismiss hypocritical blamers (Bell 2013a) or about whether it makes
sense to talk about a right or privilege to blame (King 2019) or about
the very idea of some special sort of interpersonal authority that
places some people above others for purposes of criticism (Dover
2019a, 2019b). If we opt for a minimal understanding of standing, then
these theorists are not skeptics about standing; instead, they are
theorists who argue that <em>everyone</em> has standing, even
hypocrites and meddlers. So we might simply say that they are skeptics
about <em>differential standing</em>.</p>

<p>
For now, though, let&rsquo;s leave terminological issues behind and
look a bit more closely at the blamer-based worries that often get
discussed in the literature on the standing to blame.</p>

<h4 id="Hyp">2.3.2 Hypocrisy</h4>

<p>
At least sometimes, we blame others with the aim of getting them to
see the error of their ways and change their behavior in the future.
One sure way to fail at this is to be guilty of the very same (or a
relevantly similar) transgression as the one you are condemning. The
hypocritical blamer is perhaps the paradigm example of someone whose
blame somehow goes awry. For one thing, it&rsquo;s unlikely that
hypocritical blame will be effective (Dworkin 2000, Roadevin 2018),
but the problem seems to go deeper than that. (Another way to put it:
hypocritical blame would still be problematic even if it <em>were</em>
effective.) Here we can separate a few questions: first, what, if
anything, is morally problematic about hypocritical blame; second,
what is the content and force of the standard &ldquo;who are you to
blame me&rdquo; rebuttal of hypocritical blame; third, in virtue of
what does hypocrisy undermine standing, assuming it does?</p>

<p>
So, first: what, if anything, is morally problematic about
hypocritical blame? (See Szabados and Soifer 2004 for a book length
treatment of the ethics of hypocrisy in general.) The answer to this
question will likely depend on the nature of blame. R. Jay Wallace,
for example, who advocates a Strawsonian account of blame, explains
the problem with hypocrisy by an appeal to the underlying commitments
of the reactive attitudes. For Wallace (2010: 326), &ldquo;blame
carries with it a kind of practical commitment to critical
self-scrutiny&rdquo;, a commitment that the hypocritical blamer fails
to live up to. Given that &ldquo;we all have an interest in being
protected from the kind of social disapproval and opprobrium that are
involved in blame&rdquo;, the hypocritical blamer&mdash;as long as
they aren&rsquo;t also blaming themselves, in which case they might
not count as hypocritical&mdash;treats their own interest in avoiding
blame as more important than the interest of the target of their
blame. As Wallace puts it (2010: 328): &ldquo;This offends against a
presumption in favor of the equal standing of persons that [is]
fundamental to moral thought&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Kyle Fritz and Daniel Miller (2018) offer a similar view, arguing that
hypocritical blame involves an unfair &ldquo;differential blaming
disposition&rdquo;, which &ldquo;contravenes the equality of
persons&rdquo; (2018: 123). They argue that their account, unlike
Wallace&rsquo;s, can account not only for what&rsquo;s objectionable
about hypocritical moral <em>address</em>, but also for why even
<em>unexpressed</em> hypocritical blame is morally problematic.
Emphasizing the idea of self-scrutiny more than the idea of the
equality of persons, Matt King (2020) argues that the hypocritical
blamer is guilty of misdirected attention. According to King,
&ldquo;there is a general principle favoring attending to conducting
ourselves rightly in the world over attending to the faults of
others&rdquo; (2020: 1438), and it is this principle that the
hypocritical blamer has flouted.</p>

<p>
Other accounts of the moral wrongness involved in hypocritical blame
include the idea that it is often ill-motivated and thus unfair
(Statman 2023) and that it involves dishonesty that threatens to
undermine the valuable role that blame plays in our responsibility
practices (Piovarchy forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Even if hypocritical blame is morally wrong, however, that
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily help us to make sense of the &ldquo;who are
you&rdquo; charge that motivates so much recent work on standing. When
I challenge your credentials to cast blame by accusing you of
hypocrisy, I&rsquo;m not simply trying to tell you that you are doing
something morally wrong. Although that would presumably count as a
reason to cease blaming, the &ldquo;who are you&rdquo; charge is more
pointed than the claim that the blamer has a reason to stop. Instead,
it seems like I am trying to <em>silence</em> or <em>deflect</em> your
blame in some way. (It&rsquo;s this further thought that drives some
of the skepticism about the notion of standing, since the &ldquo;who
are you&rdquo; retort may be deployed simply as an evasion.) Our
second question, then, is how exactly to make sense of the content and
force of the &ldquo;who are you&rdquo; charge when applied to a
hypocritical blamer.</p>

<p>
There are several ways to go here. For Matt King (2020), the retort
functions mainly to redirect the hypocritical blamer&rsquo;s attention
back to where it should be in the first place: on their own conduct
and character. But many theorists think of standing as involving a
positive normative status, like possessing the right or privilege or
authority to blame, in which case the retort may be a way of pointing
out that the hypocritical blamer lacks this status and thus has lost
their moral voice, so to speak. We saw above that Fritz &amp; Miller
largely agree with Wallace that hypocritical blaming is unfair because
the hypocrite harbors a &ldquo;differential blaming
disposition&rdquo;. But they go a step further by suggesting that the
normative <em>upshot</em> of the unfairness of hypocritical blame is
that the blamer &ldquo;forfeits the right to blame others&rdquo; for
violations of the norm with respect to which the hypocrisy arises
(Fritz &amp; Miller 2018: 125). This thought fits quite naturally with
some ways in which the &ldquo;who are you&rdquo; charge tends to be
formulated. When I ask the rhetorical question, &ldquo;Who are you to
blame me?&rdquo;, perhaps what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that
although <em>others</em> may have the right to blame me for this
transgression, <em>you</em> do not have such a right. Your hypocrisy
has taken it from you.</p>

<p>
Another proposal, recently developed by Ori Herstein (2017, 2020),
doesn&rsquo;t appeal to a general right to blame, but instead begins
from the insight that blaming is, in part, an attempt to <em>give
reasons</em> to the person being blamed&mdash;reasons to stop what
they are doing, to apologize, to acknowledge wrongdoing. Even without
being blamed, a wrongdoer would presumably have these reasons, but
what blame does is add another type of reason to the
mix&mdash;specifically, a <em>directive reason</em>. This richer
account of the blaming transaction opens up a new way of understanding
the &ldquo;who are you&rdquo; charge. In Herstein&rsquo;s view,
although a hypocritical blamer does still issue a valid directive
through their blame, that directive can nevertheless be permissibly
ignored &ldquo;without substantive deliberation on [its] merits&rdquo;
(Herstein 2017: 3110). Adam Piovarchy (2020) and Justin Snedegar
(2024) have also defended similar accounts, which emphasize the way
that a person who is blamed hypocritically can rightly ignore or
dismiss the second-personal demands that blame otherwise successfully
transmits (see also Edwards 2019).</p>

<p>
Finally, if hypocrisy does undermine standing, <em>why</em> does it do
so? On some views, the very same facts that ground the wrongness of
hypocritical blame also explain the loss of standing. For example,
according to Fritz and Miller (2019), the hypocritical blamer rejects
the equality of persons, which is the very thing that grounds the
right to blame in the first place. Hence there is a tight connection
between what makes hypocritical blame morally objectionable and why it
results in lost standing. Other accounts focus on the fact that the
hypocritical blamer fails to be committed to the very norm around
which their criticism has been crafted (Todd 2019, Lippert-Rasmussen
2024), though one might reasonably wonder why there is this connection
between commitment and the loss of the relevant status. (Riedener 2019
argues, for example, that commitment to the norm is a
&ldquo;constitutive rule of the speech act of blame&rdquo; (196).)
Finally, some theorists appeal to the idea of <em>relative moral
status</em>, arguing that eligibility for taking up the role of a
blamer requires that one be &ldquo;better&rdquo; in some way than the
one being blamed, whereas a hypocritical blamer is manifestly not in
such an elevated position (Todd 2023, Snedegar 2024, Snedegar
forthcoming-b).</p>

<h4 id="OthBlaBasWor">2.3.3 Other Blamer-Based Worries</h4>

<p>
Although hypocrisy is the most frequently discussed blamer-based fact
that would render blame problematic, there are certainly others worth
exploring. Here we&rsquo;ll briefly discuss four: complicity,
meddling, moral luck, and claimant injustice. (For discussion of three
other potential blamer-based worries, see Telech and Tierney 2019,
Tognazzini 2022, and O&rsquo;Brien 2022.)</p>

<p>
To charge someone with blaming hypocritically is to allege that they
are blaming (or, at least, pretending to blame) in response to
transgressions similar to those that they have committed in the past.
A somewhat related charge, but worth distinguishing, is the claim that
the blamer is somehow objectionably involved in the very act that they
are, at this very moment, condemning. This is to charge the blamer
with <em>complicity</em>, and such a charge might take many forms. G.
A. Cohen (2006: 126) gives a nice sample: &ldquo;you ordered me to do
it, you asked me to do it, you forced me to do it, you left me with no
reasonable alternative, you gave me the means to do it&rdquo;. The
superior officer who orders a subordinate to do something morally
reprehensible is not in a position to blame the subordinate for
carrying out the order, even if civilians are. And this is not
necessarily because the superior officer has done similar things in
the past, but instead because they are too closely involved in the
very act they are purporting to condemn.</p>

<p>
The issue of complicity has recently been discussed in connection with
whether the <em>state</em> has the standing to blame certain
criminals. Gary Watson (2015) and Gustavo A. Beade (2019) each raise
worries about the fact that criminality is correlated with certain
social disadvantages that the state itself may be responsible for. If
complicity in wrongdoing undermines the standing to blame, and if the
state is&mdash;as seems plausible&mdash;at least partly responsible
for the social conditions that partly explain criminal behavior, then
it suddenly becomes unclear that the state is in a position to punish
certain law-breakers. Nicola Lacey and Hanna Pickard (2021) reply by
arguing for a sharp contrast between the context of interpersonal
relationships and the context of criminal law.</p>

<p>
Although it is helpful for some purposes to distinguish hypocrisy from
complicity, it may be that at a more fundamental level they are
problematic for the same reason. This is the view that Patrick Todd
(2012, 2019) advocates. According to Todd, the reason we can raise the
&ldquo;who are you&rdquo; charge against both hypocrites and those who
are complicit in our wrongdoing is that in both cases, the
blamer&rsquo;s own behavior demonstrates a lack of commitment to the
relevant moral norm.</p>

<p>
Even if a blamer isn&rsquo;t a hypocrite and isn&rsquo;t involved in
the action they are condemning, their blame can nevertheless be
inappropriate if the wrong in question is just <em>none of their
business</em>. Linda Radzik gives a nice description of our common
moral attitudes toward these situations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Neighbors and teachers hesitate to interfere with a parent&rsquo;s
treatment of her child although they judge the treatment to be
wrongful, unless the wrong reaches a certain level of severity. Even
within close relationships, we are sometimes uncertain whether we
should express our negative moral judgment of a friend&rsquo;s
behavior. True, the hesitancy to sanction in these cases is sometimes
based on laziness, self-interest, cowardice or uncertainty about the
moral judgments at issue, none of which contradict the claim that we
have the standing to sanction. But, at other times, our hesitancy
seems to be based on the sense that it would be <em>wrong</em> to
sanction. We say, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my place to interfere even
though I can see what she is doing is wrong&rdquo;. We do not feel
entitled to sanction every wrongdoer for every wrong (Radzik 2011:
582).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the thought, of course, is that we do not <em>feel</em> entitled
to sanction every wrongdoer for every wrong because we
<em>aren&rsquo;t</em> so entitled. Radzik describes three situations
in which only a limited group of individuals could appropriately
blame: (1) cases where agents wrong themselves, (2) cases where the
wrong is &ldquo;committed within special relationships, such as
romantic partnerships, familial bonds, and friendships&rdquo; (2011:
593), and (3) cases where third-party blame &ldquo;would interfere
with the victim&rsquo;s ability to find vindication in the aftermath
of wrongdoing&rdquo; (2011: 597).</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s a good question exactly <em>why</em> appropriate blame
would be restricted only to certain individuals in these sorts of
case. Perhaps there are norms of privacy or attention at play (Smith
2007; Nagel 1998; Gaukroger 2020; King 2020; Radzik 2024), or perhaps
there&rsquo;s an illuminating analogy to be made here with the notion
of standing in the law (Sabini and Silver 1982, though see also Bell
2013a and King 2019), or perhaps if we see blame as a response which
presupposes that the person blamed is in some way accountable
<em>to</em> the members of their moral community, then we can
distinguish between several (overlapping) moral communities, only some
of which any one person belongs to, and thus only some of which
underwrite one&rsquo;s ability to blame appropriately (Duff 2010). If
we adopt Scanlon&rsquo;s account of blame (2008), then perhaps we can
say that some wrongs are none of our business because they don&rsquo;t
impair any of <em>our</em> relationships, and hence don&rsquo;t render
appropriate any blame-constituting modifications in those
relationships (see also Seim 2019 on relationship-specific norms and
the ethics of meddlesome blame).</p>

<p>
The so-called &ldquo;Business Condition&rdquo; on appropriate
blame&mdash;that blame is inappropriate if the wrong is none of your
business&mdash;is another place where it is helpful to distinguish the
question of why meddlesome blame is is morally problematic from the
question of whether and how it might undermine one&rsquo;s eligibility
to blame. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that <em>whether</em> blame
counts as meddlesome in the first place may be up for negotiation
between the blamer and the one being blamed, which perhaps shows that
sometimes blame can be legitimately ignored even if the blamer
satisfied all the (pre-existing) criteria for eligibility (Snedegar
forthcoming-a).</p>

<p>
<em>Moral luck</em> (in all its forms) provides another perspective
from which to see how blame might be inappropriate. Consider Gary
Watson&rsquo;s (1987) influential discussion of Robert Harris, who is
at once an unequivocally cruel murderer and also, in a real sense, a
victim of his tragic formative circumstances. It&rsquo;s a legitimate
question, given his history, whether Harris is even the sort of
creature who is a sensible target of blame &ndash; that is, whether Harris
is even a morally responsible agent in the first place &ndash; but even if
we grant that he is, there&rsquo;s another potential obstacle to blame
at work here. Watson expresses it like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fact that Harris&rsquo;s cruelty is an intelligible response to
his circumstances gives a foothold not only for sympathy, but for the
thought that if <em>I</em> had been subjected to such circumstances, I
might well have become as vile. What is unsettling is the thought that
one&rsquo;s moral self is such a fragile thing. One tends to think of
one&rsquo;s moral sensibilities as going deeper than that (though it
is not clear what this means). This thought induces not only an
ontological shudder, but a sense of equality with the other: I too am
a potential sinner (Watson 1987, as reprinted in Watson 2004:
245).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The obstacle to blame that Watson is describing here is not the
thought that Harris might not be blameworthy (though he might not be),
but rather the thought expressed well by the phrase &ldquo;There but
for the grace of God go I&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a humbling perspective to
take on one&rsquo;s agency, one that may &ldquo;taint one&rsquo;s own
view of one&rsquo;s moral self as an achievement&rdquo; (2004: 246),
and make one feel that &ldquo;indignation on one&rsquo;s part would be
self-righteous and indulgent&rdquo; (2004: 254). For want of a better
term, we might say that this is a worry about <em>subjunctive
hypocrisy</em>, since it certainly has a similar flavor to the
hypocrisy worry discussed above. The thought is something like this:
&ldquo;If I were as bad as him, I&rsquo;d have no standing to blame
him. But the difference between us is simply a matter of luck, and
surely my good moral luck can&rsquo;t serve as the basis for my moral
standing to blame. So I lack the standing to blame even though
I&rsquo;ve never done the terrible things in question.&rdquo; (For
recent discussion, see Isserow 2022 and Piovarchy 2023.)</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning one other fact about the blamer that can
complicate a blaming interaction, though this one fits less well into
the framework we&rsquo;ve been exploring because it&rsquo;s not
something that makes blame <em>inappropriate</em> so much as it is
something that makes blame <em>unheard</em>. We have in mind an idea
introduced by Vanessa Carbonell (2019), which she dubs <em>claimant
injustice</em>. According to Carbonell, claimant injustice
&ldquo;&hellip;occurs when social prejudices or structural
inequalities undermine a moral agent&rsquo;s ability to engage in
felicitous moral address&mdash;to make moral claims, to call out
wrongdoing, to judge or condemn others for their action, to hold
responsible, to seek redress, to blame or punish, to participate in
any of the social practices associated with the participant and
vicarious reactive attitudes&rdquo; (2019: 16). The idea here is that
the very power to engage in moral address is something that requires a
social context where the blamer is recognized as (and believes
themselves to be) a valid source of moral claims, but this context can
be absent for members of marginalized groups, thus rendering them
unable to hold members of dominant groups responsible. Thus it may be
that yet another fact about the blamer&mdash;the fact that they are
marginalized&mdash;can render blame infelicitous. (See Hornsby 1995
for related discussion.) Again, it&rsquo;s not that their blame is
<em>dismissed</em> so much as simply not heard <em>as moral
address</em> in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="VarBla">2.4 Varieties of Blame</h3>

<p>
In this entry we have focused mostly on blame understood as a negative
reaction to the moral wrongdoing of others, but in closing it&rsquo;s
worth noting three ways in which this is an oversimplification.</p>

<p>
First, we don&rsquo;t just blame others; we also blame ourselves. And
self-blame raises some distinctive issues that deserve separate
treatment (see the essays in Carlsson 2022). For example, several
authors have pointed out that questions of hypocrisy and standing get
a bit tricky in the self-regarding case, since there seems to be a
sense in which we are always hypocritical when we blame ourselves
(since we are guilty of the very same action we are blaming ourselves
for). Does this mean, then, that no one ever has the standing to blame
themselves? (For discussion, see Fritz &amp; Miller 2021, Tierney
2021, and Todd &amp; Rabern 2022.)</p>

<p>
Second, we don&rsquo;t just dish out blame for <em>moral</em>
failures. So it is worth inquiring further into the nature and ethics
of epistemic blame (Boult 2021), aesthetic blame (Kubala forthcoming),
and non-moral blame more generally (Matheson &amp; Milam 2022).</p>

<p>
Finally, blame is just one among many ways that we respond to
failures, and it&rsquo;s still an open question just how blame relates
to activities like holding responsible, demanding answers,
sanctioning, punishing, and so on. (For some attempted taxonomies, see
Macnamara 2011; Shoemaker 2011; Smith 2012; Tognazzini 2015.) So,
answers to the above questions about the ethics of blame will not
automatically double as answers to analogous questions about the
ethics of these other ways of interacting.</p>
