<h1>Translating and Interpreting Chinese Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Oct 27, 2015; substantive revision Tue Oct 28, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
A correct translation of a philosophical text should reflect the
original&rsquo;s meaning. Interpretations are theories of meaning, so
translation and interpretation intertwine. Philosophy of language,
especially philosophical semantics, deals with meaning and methodology
of interpretation. &lsquo;Meaning&rsquo; is a normative term with
different norms of application in diverse contexts. Thus, despite
their connection, the criteria for good translation and interpretation
can differ in different contexts.</p>

<p>
In philosophy, meaning matters differently than it does in translating
poetry. A good poetic translation may prioritize rhythm, rhyme, and
emotion over philosophical insight and clarity. Philosophy values a
coherent, comprehensive, and clear understanding. A philosophical poem
like Laozi&rsquo;s <em>Daodejing</em> can have many &ldquo;best&rdquo;
translations and interpretations.</p>

<p>
Translations work on words, phrases, and sentences, while meanings
address a wider range of inference related systems. To understand a
word is to know how to draw inferences from sentences containing that
word to sentences containing related words. To understand
&lsquo;uncle&rsquo; is to be able to draw inferences to sentences
containing &lsquo;male.&rsquo; We draw such inferences in arguments,
discussions and dialectical traditions. Difficulties arise when
reasoning <em>from</em> a translation rather than the original.
European concepts also come in inferentially articulated wholes.
Reasoning using the translated European concepts tempts the reader to
treat the Chinese masters as thinking in some European language.</p>

<p>
Reasoning in the European conceptual scheme, we may not notice how
inference patterns may differ between Classical Chinese and European
languages. These errors undermine the coherence and clarity of
translated philosophy. This kind of error has fueled philosophical
skepticism about Chinese thought. It looks religious because
projecting European philosophical reasoning into texts imports our
conceptual background, with its key role for supernaturally <em>pure
reason,</em> into the masters&rsquo; discussions. A &ldquo;translation
first&rdquo; policy starts this process by assuming
<em>authoritative</em> European equivalents to Chinese characters, as
in a Chinese-English dictionary. The entries, however, are not
synonyms. For &#22825; <em>ti&#257;n</em>, the dictionary entries are
<em>God</em>, <em>nature</em>, <em>sky</em>, <em>day</em>, and
<em>weather</em>. The translator hides behind the shibboleth
&ldquo;Chinese terms have more meanings than English.&rdquo; That
community treats interpretation as choosing one of the different
English terms to fit each context.</p>

<p>
Widely accepted translators&rsquo; equivalents become social norms.
Translators&rsquo; conventional wisdom in the above case is to choose
&ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; (with a capital!). Similarly, &#36947;
<em>d&agrave;o</em> (paths, ways) becomes &ldquo;The Way&rdquo; (also
with capitals). &#32681; <em>y&igrave;</em> (morality) becomes
&ldquo;righteousness&rdquo;. This obscures the moral dialectic of
ancient China<em>.</em> The postures of different schools,
&#31150;&#32681; <em>l&#464;y&igrave;</em> (ritual morality),
&#21033;&#32681; <em>l&igrave;y&igrave;</em> (benefit morality,
utilitarianism) and &#20161;&#32681; <em>r&eacute;ny&igrave;</em>
(benevolence morality) are translated as two separate things rather
than as modifier followed by modified things so their disagreement
about morality becomes another example of the same word having
different meanings for different schools, and the interpreter reads
the vibrant philosophical dialectic as a massive fallacy of
equivocation. Confucians, Daoists and Mohists speak separate
philosophical languages. The interpretation translates a moral debate
as a failure to communicate.</p>

<p>
This is an issue almost unique to classical Chinese. In this entry, we
explore how better understanding this language can help us appreciate
the difficulty of philosophical translation and the role of
comparative philosophy. It explains how philosophy&rsquo;s focus on
theories of language, mind, epistemology, metaphysics, normativity,
and nature play out in the different conceptual environment of ancient
China.</p>

<p>
Knowledge of classical philosophical issues is vital for understanding
later Chinese philosophy. Their classical systems impacted subsequent
philosophical history more than Greek classics did our own, even
granted Whitehead&rsquo;s quip that European philosophy is a series of
footnotes to Plato. Textual-historical issues further complicate our
project since early Chinese texts had distinct and complicated
compositional, editorial, and commentarial histories. Almost none were
authored by their titled &#23376; <em>z&#464;</em> masters. They were
compiled in different versions, copied or memorized and edited by
communities of student scholars. The versions that have come down to
us are widely regarded as still controversial &ldquo;good guesses&rdquo;, so even
before interpretation begins, we must resolve textual issues. This
problem of textual corruption adds to the problem of relating
different conceptual schemes, translating traditions and the disparate
disciplines studying the texts.</p>

<p>
Such complexities make this entry unique in this space&mdash;there are
no similar entries for translating Greek philosophy, German Idealism,
French Postmodernism etc. Thinking about our <em>words</em> and
<em>concepts</em> can help illustrate our point. We can count words by
types and tokens. Word types have historical patterns of use as word
tokens<em>.</em> The previous sentence has two tokens of the word
<em>word</em> that conform to English norms of use and link
inferentially to words like <em>concept, meaning</em> and
<em>reference</em>. Concepts are cognitive or mental items common to
meaning-linked words (synonyms) <em>including those of related
languages</em>.</p>

<p>
Think of Chinese characters as socially rather than mentally
constructed <em>concepts</em>. In many spoken Chinese languages, they
resemble European cognates. With phonemic writing, we view these as
different word types, e.g. <em>enough</em> and <em>genug.</em> We say
they express the same <em>mental</em> concepts, <em>ideas</em> and
thus are <em>correct</em> translations<em>.</em> Characters
metaphorically <em>stand-above</em> Chinese languages as concepts do
above European translated terms. However, they are social, historical
linguistic rather than mental items. Characters are constructed of
parts whose position and written stroke order follow historically
evolved social norms. They bring a shared history to Chinese spoken
languages the way derivation from Greek or Latin do in Europe. Spoken
and written tokens of Chinese concepts play similar inferential roles
in reasoning, as <em>Wahrheit</em> and <em>truth</em> do in Europe.
That is, they connect in similar ways to words for <em>fact</em>,
<em>believe</em>, <em>valid</em>, and <em>proof</em>. These
inferential roles in Chinese are embodied in Classical Chinese texts.
This insight is one way of understanding the claim that Chinese and
Europeans operate with different <em>conceptual</em> schemes.</p>

<p>
Words further divide into those we can expect in any human language to
contain, such as <em>sun</em>, <em>moon</em>, <em>tree</em>,
<em>mother</em>, and <em>eat</em>, and those only found in cultures
with certain theories&mdash;&ldquo;theory-laden&rdquo; terms like
<em>atom</em>, <em>germ</em>, <em>genus</em>, and <em>brain</em>.
Western theology uses the theoretical terms <em>God</em>,
<em>soul</em>, and <em>sin</em>. We can look for synonyms in European
languages because we share that theology. Interpreters who assumed
religion is universal and philosophy a (possibly unique) Western
theoretical development tended to treat the theory-laden terms of
Western theology as belonging in the former word class, as linguistic
universals. Similarly, others may treat conventional linguistic
wisdom--the shared European theory of language, mind, thought, ideas
and reason as likely to have counterparts in Chinese just as they do
in Spanish.</p>

<p>
These facts highlight how classical Chinese written language, Wenyan,
differs from the languages derived from the family of languages
written in alphabetic scripts. Key Western philosophical concepts flow
from reflections in Plato and Aristotle about language, including the
distinction of mind, ideas, thought from body, matter, feelings.
China&rsquo;s philosophical history, however, includes a long period
of exchange with Buddhism starting some 500 years after the classical
period. It introduced a version of Idealism including other key
concepts like thoughts, beliefs, laws/principles and truths. It shared
with the Greeks an attitude that disvalued the many, sensible,
changing appearances in favor of the one, permanent, reality.</p>

<p>
As noted above, the core issues concern the classical Chinese scheme
of philosophical concepts. Western understanding of Indian thought is
also problematic, but both its status as philosophy and its conception
of language, mind and the universe are <em>considerably</em> more
familiar, accessible and less interpretively controversial. The mix of
classical Chinese and Buddhist concepts in Chinese Buddhism did
influence subsequent medieval Neo-Confucianism, but didn&rsquo;t
markedly divert the mainstream of historical Chinese philosophy. Here,
accordingly, we will focus on translation of texts from the
pre-Buddhist period in China which extends from roughly the
7<sup>th</sup> century bce to the 2<sup>nd</sup> century ce.</p>

<p>
China&rsquo;s stereotype as the ultimate &ldquo;Other&rdquo; for
Europeans stems partly from its differences, but more from its
comparably rich classical and commentarial philosophical tradition.
The diversity of Chinese spoken languages and the pivotal role of
Chinese classics, written in Wenyan, make it unsurprising that Leibniz
would conclude that China resembled an &ldquo;Oriental Europe&rdquo;
(Leibniz <em>Writings on China</em>: 12 [1708]).</p>

<p>
Below, we delve into the problems classical Chinese language has posed
for translators and interpreters. We examine methodological,
metaphysical, and comparative issues relating to the reading of these
foundational classical texts. We address some illustrative exegetical
and translation concerns. Our primary focus will be on philosophical
issues in intradisciplinary scholarly dispute. We attempt accounts of
the disputes and the implications that clarify how philosophical
interpretation should inform translation of these philosophical
texts.</p>

<h2 id="ClaChiLanStrFun">1. The Classical Chinese Language: Structure and Function</h2>

<h3 id="ChiCha">1.1 Chinese Characters</h3>

<p>
Instead of alphabet characters, the structure of a Chinese character
starts with the brushstroke, vertical, corner, dot etc. These are
shared with techniques in watercolor painting, linking writing to
artistic representation. The next level of structure is the
<em>radical</em>, usually a <em>pictogram</em> like <em>human</em>
(&#20154; <em>ren</em>), <em>tree/wood</em> (&#26408;
<em>m&ugrave;</em>), <em>sun/day</em> (&#26085; <em>r&igrave;</em>)
and <em>moon/month</em> (&#26376;<em>yu&egrave;</em>). The
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of writing includes both the stroke order of the
parts and the order of writing such parts in writing the composite
character. The <em>radical</em> usually is on left or top or bottom of
the character.</p>

<p>
Traditional dictionaries arranged characters by these
<em>radicals</em> which typically pick out a semantic <em>type</em>.
Chinese accounts described three other major types of character
structure. Some were <em>indicatives</em>, like
&#19968;&#20108;&#19977; (ancient Chinese used a decimal system),
<em>above</em> (&#19978; <em>sh&agrave;ng</em>), <em>below</em>
(&#19979; <em>xi&agrave;</em>) and <em>center</em> (&#20013;
<em>zh&#333;ng</em>). Others were <em>ideograms,</em> metaphorical
arrangements of inferentially linked character parts. A paradigm was
<em>bright</em> (&#26126; <em>m&iacute;ng</em> enlightened,
understand) made up of <em>sun/day</em> and <em>moon.</em> A fun
example for political science students is <em>state</em> (&#22283;
<em>gu&oacute;</em>), a bounded territory with a monopoly of coercion
(a pictogram of a halberd &#25096;) over a population (of
<em>mouths</em> &#21475;). These mnemonics for teaching and learning
characters are not always etymologically accurate, but they shape
Chinese conceptions of how words (&#21517; <em>m&iacute;ng</em> names)
and language (&#35328; <em>y&aacute;n</em>) work.</p>

<p>
The structure with most dictionary entries pairs the <em>radical</em>
part with a <em>phonetic</em> homonym or cognate in some of the spoken
languages of China. This structure effectively writes all
counterparts, roughly cognates and shared concepts in the different
Chinese spoken languages. These words/names have scope; they
&ldquo;pick out&rdquo; or draw attention to some part of the natural
world (&#26377;<em>y&#466;u</em> existence, reality). Language is a
tool for coordinating our behavior by sharing information. A phonetic
compound structure&rsquo;s scope is a part of the scope of the
semantic <em>radical</em>: &ldquo;the kind of X that sounds like
Y.&rdquo; Almost 7000 out of the 9350+ graphs recorded in the ancient
<em>Shuowen fall in this category</em>.</p>

<p>
There were over a thousand phonetic elements used; modern Mandarin has
only about 400 distinct syllables, Cantonese has 1,500, so in
composing this type, one could see the phonetic element both as (a) a
homophone in some of the other 40 languages and also as (b) one of the
other roleplayers: ideograph, indicative or pictograph.</p>

<p>
European scholars, from late 16<sup>th</sup>-century Jesuit
missionaries on, have been fascinated by this written language.
Andreas Muller described this phonetic &ldquo;key&rdquo; for Chinese
in the 1670s. His writings excited the young, China-curious, Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz (<em>Writings on China</em>: 11 [1668]) and various
other theorists, like Jacob Gohl and John Webb (1669) who treated it
as a kind of universal language (Duyvendak 1936). Leibniz eventually
abandoned this line of thought for work on logic (<em>Writings on
China</em>: 38 [1679]).</p>

<p>
For the next 150 years philosophical amateurs, missionaries,
merchants, and diplomats to the &ldquo;Middle Kingdom&rdquo; mixed
their impressionistic view with Western &ldquo;folk theory&rdquo; of
language and mind. A signature early focus was whether Chinese could
express the truths of Western religion. The Jesuits first, and
Protestants a few centuries later, translated &lsquo;God&rsquo; in
different ways and tried to &ldquo;logic&rdquo; Chinese intellectuals
into believing in a &ldquo;landlord of the sky&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;great ancestor&rdquo; of ancestor worship&mdash;the emperor of
the afterlife society above. Both failed (Kurtz, 2011 Ch. 1, pp
58&ndash;63).</p>

<p>
Another more recent fascination is a dispute about relation of Chinese
characters to Plato&rsquo;s forms (<em>eid&ecirc;</em>) and
Locke&rsquo;s <em>ideas</em>. How do they do the work of familiar
Western &ldquo;mind and idea theories&rdquo; of meaning and belief?
Among Sinologists, it became a quarrel about whether to allow the use
of <em>ideograph</em> to describe Chinese characters (see Creel 1936,
1938; Peter Boodberg 1937, 1940; DeFrancis 1984; Hannas 1977: 6;
Hansen 1993; Unger 1993). Alternatives proposed include
<em>lexigraphs</em>, <em>phonograms</em>, <em>phonic indicators</em>,
<em>phonoideographs</em>, <em>logographs</em>, <em>morphographs</em>,
<em>sinographs</em>, <em>syllabograms</em>, and
<em>syllabo-phonograms</em> (DeFrancis 1984: 73; the list is
incomplete).</p>

<p>
On the surface, this is an empty verbal dispute. &ldquo;Chinese
characters&rdquo; is a perfectly good term for
&#23383;<em>z&igrave;</em> (characters). The 26 characters of English
play segmental phonemic roles that change with the surrounding
characters and spaces to form the written word. Chinese characters
have role-playing parts but they play a variety of different roles.
The relation of the whole character to spoken languages differs as
well. The philosophical upshot is that differences in role and
structure remove key ways ancient Greek masters motivated their theory
of mind, of ideas, and of the inner world of subjective thought (e.g.
Aristotle, <em>De interpretatione</em>, 1, 16a3&ndash;8). The above
verbal dispute arose from illicitly mixing the two ontologies of
language and importing an unmotivated dualist metaphysics of
<em>language</em> as &ldquo;representing intellectual items&rdquo;
that mediate the relation of language to the world. The Chinese
conventional-historical theory leaves out that elusive mediator. The
condemnation of &lsquo;ideograph&rsquo; assumes its meaning must be
framed in terms of European idea (mental image) theory. It projects
Lockean abstract ideas into the Chinese account of two of their
character types. Chinese theory of semantics is more like Saul
Kripke&rsquo;s (1980) theory of rigid designators. It is a version of
the causal-historical theory of reference.</p>

<p>
Chinese people have taught their theory of the roles of characters to
successive generations in the process of training them in how to use
<em>their</em> written language. The theory foregrounds sociology and
culture as shared human practices. Their <em>mental</em> roles are the
more non-linguistic ones of planning (simulating), imagining
(empathizing), and remembering, accompanied by feelings and moods,
e.g. happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy. One kind of philosophical
interest in studying Chinese philosophy is seeing how the metaphysical
linguistic roles they saw characters playing cohered with Chinese
theory of <em>mind</em> (&#24515;<em>x&#299;n</em> heart-mind) and
nature. It gives us a way to conceive of an alternative to Western
semantic psychology. The details of this Chinese theory of language
rest on their deep insights into human social nature, their view of
their cultural history and their shared interaction with the natural
world.</p>

<p>
Twentieth-century Western philosophy, especially since Wittgenstein,
has reflected on how to improve these &ldquo;folk&rdquo; philosophies
of language which inform so much of the philosophical enterprise.
Chinese theory of their language equally clearly shaped theirs in a
similar way. It is a different theory of a different language, and it
informs and inspires a different philosophy.</p>

<p>
It is best to sidestep this verbal dispute, use
&ldquo;characters&rdquo; and &ldquo;graphs&rdquo; interchangeably,
proceed to try and appreciate the traditional Chinese conception of
<em>their own</em> written language.</p>

<p>
Many differences in the ontology of language flow from this writing
system. Chinese is a branch of a language family with as rich and
varied a map of languages as Europe&rsquo;s. To say, &ldquo;I speak
Chinese&rdquo; is like saying &ldquo;I speak European&rdquo;. Wenyan
is analogous to a written form of the language branch. It evolved
separately from the spoken languages. We can trace its evolution up to
the 20<sup>th</sup> century when a northern dialect, Mandarin, was
chosen to replace it in China. For most of Chinese history the grammar
of Wenyan had been a slowly evolving version of the language in the
Master Texts of China&rsquo;s classical period.</p>

<p>
Wenyan thus plays a cultural role partly analogous to that of
classical Greek <em>and</em> Latin. It preserves the broad conceptual
structure through a historical dialectic. The different Chinese spoken
languages have their own ways of pronouncing the
characters&mdash;their cognates and synonyms. When Japanese, Korean
and Vietnamese speakers borrowed written Chinese, they imported a
whole coherent conceptual structure. None viewed writing as
<em>representing</em> sounds of their speech, but all assumed there
was a correct way of <em>reading aloud</em> the classical text in
their spoken language.</p>

<p>
The grammar and vocabulary of each spoken language in China was
different and none of them is or (probably) ever was the grammar of
the classical texts. Reading philosophical classics aloud would seldom
yield grammatically intelligible speech in any of the languages of
East Asia. When the text was pronounced in a local language, the words
were recognizable and the syntax was generic, in the form:
topic-comment. The written language should not be seen as a
transcription of speech (Graham 1987: 390; DeFrancis 1984: 126). There
are, in effect, no &ldquo;native speakers&rdquo; of classical
Chinese.</p>

<p>
This way of dividing the linguistic world into a <em>written
language</em> (&#25991;<em>w&eacute;n</em> decoration) and many
different spoken languages (&#35486; <em>y&#468;</em>, &#35441;
<em>hu&agrave;)</em> contributed greatly to the cohesiveness of East
Asian culture and to making the classics more accessible to successive
generations. The classical written language
(&#25991;&#35328;<em>w&eacute;ny&aacute;n</em> writing language) keyed
the civilizing process (&#25991;&#21270;<em>w&eacute;nhu&agrave;</em>
changed by <em>w&eacute;n</em>, civilized, educated). The spoken
linguistic diversity of China was probably always like that of Europe,
but they were able to communicate in a semi-artificial language of
great economy and elegance, with poetic power, and access to rich
allusions to a robust, shared literary, religious and philosophical
tradition.</p>

<p>
What follows &ldquo;so-and-so said&rdquo; in any classical text is
hardly ever a strict transcription of something a speaker actually
said. It expressed the core <em>d&agrave;o</em> of the speech in
Wenyan. Adding a syntactic/stylistic note in this context, one
scholarly wit has said of the classical language, &ldquo;Its
telegraphic terseness could reflect ordinary speech only if every
Chinese speaker were far more laconic than any Gary Cooper
character&rdquo; (Hansen 1992: 34).</p>

<p>
Although the grammar of Wenyan differs from any language spoken then
or now, one shouldn&rsquo;t think it was consciously put together as
an artificial construction for that purpose (see Jacob Gohl in
Duyvendak 1936: 6). Rather, it almost surely evolved from the
divination inscriptions found on the oracle bones of the Shang Dynasty
(Keightley 1978). The written and spoken languages evolved separately
over centuries and writing had understandingly less impact on unifying
pronunciations but more immediate access to classical conceptual
philosophical structure.</p>

<p>
As the spoken words underwent phonetic evolution the practice of
reading the texts could continue seamlessly and we can <em>count</em>
the concepts as pervading the various pronunciations. Classical
philosophizing began when the Mohists elaborated a theory of
<em>terms</em> (&#21517; <em>m&iacute;ng</em> names) as linked to
<em>distinctions</em> (&#36783; <em>b&igrave;an</em> discriminations)
between parts of the world and, along with the figures of the
&ldquo;School of Names&rdquo;, began to analyze the emerging practice
of writing two-character compounds. The issue was finding a stable way
the compounds picked out a scope of reality based on the scopes of the
separate characters. Modern dictionaries of vernaculars treat two
types of compounds as counterparts of individual words of European.
But there were other types of compounds which are more like what we
would call predicates or sentences.</p>

<p>
The literary written syntax, e.g., the emergence of these different
kinds of compounds, may either have reflected changes in some of the
spoken languages or ignited them. Factors such as these helped lead
the sinologist Hurlee Creel to claim that &ldquo;The Chinese
characters made Chinese civilization the culture of the book and not
the orator&rdquo; (Creel 1997: 447).</p>

<h3 id="SynClaChi">1.2 On the Syntax of Classical Chinese</h3>

<p>
Classical Chinese is an isolating language, meaning that each graph in
isolation is a word. They are not marked for &ldquo;part of
speech&rdquo; (i.e., inflected like <em>-ity</em>, <em>-ly</em>, or
<em>-ing)</em> nor for case, number (singular/plural), gender, or
tense. It has an &ldquo;SVO&rdquo; (subject verb object) syntax and a
first-person pronoun can be I, me, we, or us. <em>Go</em> (&#21435;
<em>q&ugrave;</em>) may follow today, yesterday, and tomorrow without
change. Wenyan has a grammar. Several empty particles help fix the
grammatical roles characters play but the grammatical sentence is not
further highlighted by part-of-speech inflections for the characters.
Hence, language users need learn no sentence-bound rules of agreement
in number, tense, case or gender. We may describe it as a
topic-comment structure since the SVO structure is technically (S)VO.
The subject term is frequently omitted, e.g., when previously
introduced, presupposed, or unnecessary (e.g. the &ldquo;it&rdquo; in
&ldquo;It is raining.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>
Not infrequently the identity of the omitted subject is <em>not</em>
clear, and equally competent readers may disagree about whether we are
reading an indicative or imperative sentence. This is particularly the
case with brief, stylized stanzas of poetry. Consequently, writers
have relied on parallel constructions, implicitly inviting the reader
to parse them the same way. This helps us interpret otherwise
ambiguous sentences. This style may have originated from the practice
of using parallelism and poetry to aid memorization of passages for
oral transmission.</p>

<p>
Thus, style and syntax are intertwined in classical Chinese. The
parsing of many sentences is controversial. This is exacerbated by the
lack of punctuation in early Wenyan: no periods, quotation marks,
commas, question marks, exclamations inserted into the original texts.
This prompted some copyists to insert the particles that impose a
parsing. So, the recently discovered Han version of the Laozi has both
the assertion marker (&#20063; <em>y&#283;</em>) and comma-like
slashes to yield the student&rsquo;s desired parsing. This
indeterminism in structure means interpretation has both a lexical and
grammatical component. We hypothesize both a parsing of the syntax and
meanings of the characters to form the interpretation that justifies a
translation (Fuller 1999: 2; Karlgren 1962).</p>

<p>
Wenyan has several &ldquo;function words.&rdquo; Traditional accounts
call these &lsquo;empty names&rsquo; (&#34395;&#21517;
x<em>&#363;m&iacute;ng</em>) in contrast to the <em>&lsquo;</em>solid
names&rsquo; (&#23526;&#21517; <em>sh&iacute;m&iacute;ng</em>) which
pick out (draw attention to) concrete parts of reality. The empty
names are characters that help us parse sentences and arguments, such
as the above assertion marker &#20063; <em>y&#283;</em> and question
marker &#20046; <em>h&#363;</em>. Other particles with grammatical
roles include <em>with/using</em> (&#20197;<em>y&#464;</em>) which
precedes the main verb, and <em>in/on/at/to</em> (&#26044; y&uacute;)
which follows the verb. Particles like <em>that-which</em> (&#32773;
<em>zh&#283;</em>) nominalizes verbs and adjectives. Logical
connectives include <em>and/but</em> (&#32780; <em>&eacute;r</em>) and
<em>if-then</em> (&#21063; <em>z&eacute;</em>) and several negators.
So, although classical thinkers did not develop a theory of argument
forms, it could express all basic logical relations. Using a modern
phrase structure (Chomsky) grammar, we can show how to generate an
unlimited number of sentences of classical language from a very few
rewrite rules to express anything that can be expressed in symbolic
logical form.</p>

<p>
Obviously, the ancient masters did not formulate these rules. The
classical readers and writers just &ldquo;caught on&rdquo; to the
structure. The evidence suggests they learned by imitating the style
of their masters and copying sections for themselves.</p>

<p>
While the rules allow us to generate infinitely many propositions in
this written language, working backwards from the written text often
yields several possible derivations from the rules and lexicon. The
upshot is texts are ambiguous without context, e.g., the presupposed
topic. Indeed, it has been argued that while the focus of language in
English is the sentence, in classical Chinese it is context (DeFrancis
1984: 52; Hansen 1992: 34).</p>

<p>
There is much more to say about the syntax of classical Chinese, e.g.
the absence of a linking verb (<em>is/was/were</em>), different
versions of which we seem to find in spoken Cantonese and Mandarin,
but there were different negative linking words, one for noun-phrase
predicates and another for verbal predicates. These turn out to be
important for the analytical philosophers of the classical period. In
summary, for the purpose of understanding issues of translation in
Chinese philosophy, we might let the author of a contemporary textbook
of classical Chinese have the last word:</p>

<blockquote>
[T]here may be several perfectly grammatical ways to explain the
syntax of a [classical Chinese] sentence. Skill in reading lies in
deciding which alternative is most likely&hellip; Such judgments of
meaning cannot be based on grammar alone. They rely not only on a
knowledge of grammar, but also on a sense of the larger arguments of
the sentence, the paragraph, and the composition as a whole. (Fuller
1999: 2)
</blockquote>

<h3 id="SemChiCha">1.3 On the Semantics of Chinese Characters</h3>

<p>
Let us see how these syntax, semantics, text, discipline and tradition
contribute to generating a plethora of interpretations. We shall look
at perhaps the most famous passage of the most translated text of
Chinese thought, Laozi&rsquo;s <em>Daodejing</em>. A translation aims
for a meta-language expression with the same meaning as the target
language. (Here, respectively, English and classical Chinese.) The
different conceptions of <em>meaning</em> are formulated as
interpretive principles of charity and humanity. The principle of
charity says interpret so the target comes out true. The principle of
humanity assumes an interpreter&rsquo;s ability to follow the
argument, understand the way of getting to and from the target
sentence. So, we interpret in a way that helps us understand what
leads to asserting it and what follows from it.</p>

<p>
The text has been translated to English over 500 times, as a
religious, political, poetic, and philosophical text. The religious
perspective interprets it using the model of Western &ldquo;supreme
being&rdquo; mysticism, the poetic as a poem, and the political as a
platform. How should we read it philosophically? The philosophical
upshot of the religious reading is quietism. For a peek at the Chinese
philosophical universe, let us take a closer look.</p>

<p>
The opening line of Chapter I reads:</p>

<blockquote>
&#36947; &#21487; &#36947; &#38750; &#24120; &#36947;
<br />
<em>D&agrave;o k&#283; d&agrave;o f&#275;i ch&aacute;ng
d&agrave;o</em>. (<em>D&agrave;o</em> can-be <em>d&agrave;o</em>-ed
is-not constant <em>d&agrave;o</em>)
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>&#36947;<em>d&agrave;o</em> way, road</dt>
<dd>

<p>
(in first, third, and sixth positions here) in modern vernacular is
used to name major <em>roads. Paths</em> and <em>lanes</em> are the
central metaphors for understanding both the natural and the normative
<em>course</em> for all <em>things</em>. Semantically,
<em>d&agrave;o</em> is the metaphorical counterpart of English
&ldquo;way&rdquo; but has more metaphorical gravity. Chinese thought
pivots around <em>d&agrave;o</em> as Western does around
<em>reason</em> and <em>law</em>. Europeans theorized about
&ldquo;natural and moral law.&rdquo; China theorizes about possible
and permissible <em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p></dd>
<dt>&#21487; <em>k&#283;</em> can-be/may-be</dt>
<dd>

<p>
A modal operator that makes the following verb passive&mdash;here
&ldquo;can/may be <em>d&agrave;o-</em>ed<em>.&rdquo;</em> The
underlying active phrase structure is &ldquo;_____ can <em>d&agrave;o
d&agrave;o</em>, and the parallel in the second line is &rdquo;_____
can name names.&ldquo; We can coin, use, and mention terms. We can
construct, point to, and follow ways.</p></dd>
<dt>&#38750; <em>f&#275;i</em> (it) is-not</dt>
<dd>

<p>
One of two negators. It negates a nominal predicate. The other
<em>not</em> (&#19981; <em>b&ugrave;</em>) negates verb phrases.
&rdquo;___ is not constant <em>d&agrave;o</em>&ldquo;</p></dd>
<dt>&#24120; <em>ch&aacute;ng</em> constant</dt>
<dd>

<p>
&lsquo;unvarying&rsquo;, &lsquo;constant&rsquo;,
&lsquo;enduring&rsquo;, &lsquo;unchanging&rsquo;,
&lsquo;reliable&rsquo;.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Literally, then, we have something like &rdquo;<em>dao</em> can be
<em>dao-ed; (It) is</em> not inevitable <em>dao.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p>
The second line illustrates the role of parallelism:</p>

<blockquote>
&#21517; &#21487; &#21517; &#38750;&#24120;&#21517;
<br />
<em>M&iacute;ng k&#283; m&iacute;ng f&#275;i ch&aacute;ng
m&iacute;ng</em> (name can/may-be named is-not constant name)
</blockquote>

<p>
Everything is the same except the metaphorical <em>d&agrave;o</em> is
replaced by the overtly linguistic <em>name</em> (&#21517;
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> term, word). So, &rdquo;Names can be named. They
are not inevitable names.&ldquo;</p>

<p>
Here are six translations of this passage.</p>

<ol>

<li>The way that can be spoken of is not the constant way. (Lau 1963:
57)</li>

<li>The Way that can be told of is not an Unvarying Way. (Waley 1934:
141)</li>

<li>The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging
Tao. (Legge 1891 [1959]: 95)</li>

<li>A Way that can be followed is not a constant Way. (Ivanhoe 2002:
1)</li>

<li>Way-making (<em>dao)</em> that can be put into words is not really
way-making. (Ames and Hall 2003: 77)</li>

<li>As to a Dao&mdash;If it can be specified as a Dao, it is not a
permanent Dao. (Moeller 2007: 3)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The best philosophical translation will be the best philosophy
permissible by the best lexical and syntactic theory. Lexically, the
greatest variation in these translations is how they understand the
verbal use of <em>d&agrave;o.</em> The majority (1, 2, 5 &amp; 6) make
<em>d&agrave;o</em> (v) a speech act or linguistic behavior. The
others (3 &amp; 4) reflect the metaphor&rsquo;s logic, and make
<em>d&agrave;o</em>ing walking or following a way. The second
line&rsquo;s verbal use of &lsquo;name&rsquo; is less puzzling because
English treats naming as a speech act. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s quip
&rdquo;<em>D&agrave;o</em>s are made by walking them&ldquo; supports
this lexical choice.</p>

<p>
Next, a bit of syntax. Wenyan nouns can be a noun subject or object
phrase without any articles or demonstratives. English requires one of
these (<em>a, some, the</em> or <em>this/that</em>) or to pluralize
the noun. Translations 1&ndash;3 inject English&rsquo;s <em>the,</em>
4 and 6 inject <em>a</em>, and 5 makes the initial <em>d&agrave;o</em>
a process verb (think of constructing a road). So, 5 has chosen an
interpretation that suggests social constructivism in norm theory, on
the model of constructing new terms. None of the translations opt to
pluralize their translation of <em>d&agrave;o.</em> An advantage of
doing so is that it would a) yield clear grammatical English without
adding articles and b) produce a true sentence <em>iff</em> the
alternatives were true. Notice how implicitly we pluralize the subject
term in the parallel second line about <em>names</em>.</p>

<p>
Syntactically, Wenyan is a &rdquo;left-branching&ldquo; language,
i.e., does not use restrictive <em>that-</em>clauses. To get it to
restrict the scope of the first <em>d&aacute;o,</em> the modifier (can
be <em>d&agrave;o</em>-ed) should precede it. Traditional commentary
on the passage begins with Wang Bi (226&ndash;249 CE), roughly half a
century after the classical period. His commentary rewrote the first
sentence to yield that result: <em>can-be d&agrave;o-ed
d&agrave;o</em> (&#21487;&#36947;&#20043;&#36947;). All the above
translations except 6 technically translate Wang Bi&rsquo;s
commentary, not his Wenyan text</p>

<p>
So, the above translations differ lexically, syntactically,
semantically and philosophically. Number 5 is both philosophically
viable and relevant to the Confucian-Mohist and later Daoist
(Zhuangzi&rsquo;s) discourse on the shared causal-historical theory of
rectifying names. The text commits to two axioms of Daoist
social-construction theory. The universe of discourse includes
structures called <em>d&agrave;o</em> that <em>can be
constructed</em>. They are not <em>universal constants</em>. However,
5 is syntactically a reach in the same way as all but
6&mdash;translating Wang Bi&rsquo;s rewrite instead of Laozi.</p>

<p>
Wang Bi and these translators would argue that they are trying to
formulate Laozi&rsquo;s beliefs. Paul Grice (1913&ndash;1988)
distinguished between <em>speaker meaning</em> and <em>language
meaning</em>. The philosopher is interested in the language meaning of
the text. Philosophy, at this point, is distinguished by being
anti-authoritarian, not worshipping the author&rsquo;s beliefs. They
would not take refuge in a principle of charity that maximized the
truth of the text under translation. The Chinese philosophical
community was engaged in a discourse geared to communal intellectual
progress. Ethical constructivism is a viable theory, albeit
controversial. Whether it&rsquo;s the best philosophical translation
is tied up with whether we can defend the moral posture in a
philosophical dialectic. In China it appears not to have been a point
of contention among the rival schools.</p>

<p>
The translations above trace a slow philosophical evolution of
interpreters&rsquo; views of this passage. Philosophical translation
of the text is itself a philosophical activity. It is doing philosophy
in a Wenyan dialectic with Confucian and Mohist philosophers. The
important differences are in our theories (<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) of
language which we teach and learn as students. One option open to
modern philosophical interpreters is to recognize some uses of
characters to be mentioning bits of language themselves&mdash;names
can be named (mentioned) as well as used. At this point we have
adequate material for a naturalistic theory of the norms of use for
both words and language.</p>

<p>
The different priorities of philosophers and religious interpreters
clearly come to the fore here. Philosophers seek clarity and coherence
while dealing with gradual understanding of features of the language
like parallelism. Coherence, thus, plays a different role in
philosophical interpretation. It is not about being charitable to the
writer but to the community. We try to read this and the 80 other
chapters as a philosophical contribution to a philosophical discussion
going on during the classical period among the schools reflecting on
shared themes: terms, language, social practices, norms and the
natural world. Philosophers have no <em>a priori</em> commitment to
making the passage into a transcendent truth, but do to making it a
serious philosophical contribution to a developing discussion of a
community point of view. To translate a philosophical text, we must
think philosophically using the Chinese conceptual scheme and
immersing ourselves in the philosophical issues of the time.</p>

<p>
Justifying a philosophical translation does not rule out religious
interpretations. Religious interpretation remains the better
<em>anthropological</em> choice, it informs us about how the bulk of
religious Daoists since Wang Bi have read the text. There may be no
adequate philosophical translation, no way to understand it in the
context (Confucian, Mohist, etc.) in which it emerged&mdash;a vibrant
philosophical discourse about language, social norms, and constant
nature. Nothing guarantees that if philosophers try, they must
succeed. The case for trying to find good philosophy was strongly
confirmed by the rediscovery of the Later Mohist texts dealing with
theory of language. The case that Laozi&rsquo;s text deals with
language is plain from the 2<sup>nd</sup> line. It also discusses
historical processes, nature, being and non-being, desire and
mysteries. These are philosophical themes and several are viable
modern philosophical projects&mdash;process philosophy, part-whole
metaphysics, anti-fatalism and moral constructivism.</p>

<p>
The six examples above show that translations can vary in lexical and
syntactic justification, and interpretations can come to have better
philosophical justifications. There is no reason to believe this
evolution cannot continue. The principle of humanity requires
philosophical thinking using classical concepts. Philosophy can give
us more and better ways to deal with Wenyan&rsquo;s syntactic-semantic
structure&mdash;e.g., a part-whole semantics (Banka 2023; Banka 2018).
Banka draws on an earlier theory about the Mohist philosophy of
language (Hansen 1983). One of the Mohists&rsquo; key insights is that
claiming all language is defective is self-defeating: &rdquo;If all language
is defective, saying so is defective&ldquo; (Mozi Book 10, Canon II #172).
Thus, if the religious translation were correct, the
<em>philosophers</em> of the time already knew it was incoherent. The
<em>Zhuangzi</em> rejects Tian Pian&rsquo;s anti-teaching quietism on
similar grounds&mdash;&rdquo;it could not avoid being <em>wrong</em>
(&#38750; <em>f&#275;i</em> not-that)&ldquo; (Zhuangzi 33).</p>

<p>
If the student new to the study of Chinese philosophy takes away one
idea from this brief summarization of a complex set of interconnected
linguistic issues focusing on texts, perhaps the most fruitful one
would be that philosophizing in classical Chinese is unlike
transcribed speech. It is a discussion in written form among a writing
community engaged in philosophical dialectic around social norms,
physical nature and human know-how.</p>

<p>
A second useful idea to retain would be that relatively few issues of
translation of early Chinese texts can be resolved without engaging in
philosophical reflection. Even judging better from worse readings must
draw on a way of sorting them. Philosophers&rsquo; ways of sorting are
the principles of charity and humanity (&#20161; <em>r&eacute;n</em>).
Below, we will begin with some issues that are of import both in
contemporary Western philosophy and for the student of Chinese
thought, following which we will concentrate directly on the
latter.</p>

<p>
One long-time student of early Daoism summed up the matter succinctly:
&rdquo;Reading [it] is an act of creation&ldquo; (Welch 1971: 11). We
will return to the theme of ambiguity&mdash;both syntactic and
semantic&mdash;in
 <a href="#TraTru">&sect;4.2</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="MetaIss">2. Metaphysical Issues</h2>

<h3 id="VerIdeDifConSch">2.1 On the Very Idea of Different Conceptual Schemes</h3>

<p>
In 1973, Donald Davidson challenged semantic views that postulated
different conceptual schemes. His argument started from the principle
of charity: to understand the speakers of any <em>actual</em> human
language, we must &rdquo;count them right in most matters.. The
beliefs of the speakers must be caused by the actual world. Different
linguistic communities conduct their cooperative navigation of the
same natural world that we do. Quine (1960 [2013]) drew a distinction
between terms we would expect to be in any language (<em>mother, up,
tree</em>) and those that work along with others in a theory, i.e.,
<em>theory laden</em> terms like <em>law, duty, gravity</em>. We would
be surprised if any language had no way of translating what we say
truly about the former. The latter, however, are likely to overlap
only when we have reason to assume we share substantially similar
theories. Sellars (1956 [2002]) added that when we master concepts, we
learn how they work in inferences using other theory laden
(&ldquo;inferentially articulated&rdquo;) terms.</p>

<p>
Davidson deals mainly with the relation of truth and translation. His
argument hinges on his rejection of what he calls &ldquo;the third
dogma of empiricism&rdquo;, namely, that we can conceive of an
uninterpreted reality&mdash;taken as &ldquo;a neutral ground&rdquo; or
&ldquo;coordinate system&rdquo;&mdash;by means of which we could
compare and contrast differing conceptual schemes. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
In giving up dependence on the concept of an uninterpreted reality
&hellip;we do not relinquish the concept of objective
truth&mdash;quite the contrary. Given the dogma of a dualism of scheme
and reality, we get conceptual relativity, and truth relative to a
scheme. Without the dogma, this kind of relativity goes by the board.
Of course truth of sentences remains relative to language, but that is
as objective as can be. (Davidson 1973: 20)
</blockquote>

<p>
Angus Graham rejected Davidson&rsquo;s claim. He held that the idea of
a different conceptual scheme was indispensable for scholars of the
language and thought of other cultures (Graham 1992: 59). Graham
argued that languages without a common ancestor may have fewer
synonymous terms in their lexicons, and consequently more sentences in
such languages (i.e., English and Chinese) will need guarded and
heavily qualified translations (Graham 1992: 65).</p>

<p>
The major problem with Davidson&rsquo;s argument is his reliance on
<em>truth</em>. This makes his account of <em>meaning</em> applicable
to <em>propositions</em> (sentence-sized abstract objects). Those
three concepts are pivots in traditional Western philosophy of
language and clearly fall in Quine&rsquo;s &ldquo;theory laden&rdquo;
category. If we understand them, we know how to draw inference
relations among them, e.g. &ldquo;whether or not this
<em>sentence</em> is <em>true</em> depends on what it
<em>means</em>.&rdquo; As we&rsquo;ve seen, the Chinese philosophy of
their own language has no commitment to mental concepts as components
of mental sentences (beliefs). So, the only relativity presumed here
is that of truth to language, which, as Davidson acknowledges, is
&ldquo;as objective as can be.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Hansen and Graham argue that in translating classical philosophy, it
is usually misleading to translate &#30495; (<em>zh&#275;n</em> real,
natural, authentic) as <em>true</em> for Western audiences. It could,
however, be correct after the introduction of Buddhism (Post-Han C,
200 ce). In Pre-Han Chinese, they argue, the concept was not linked to
propositions (beliefs, thoughts, sentences, statements etc.).
<em>Zh&#275;n</em> was classically used for the <em>nature</em> side
of the dialectic of nature vs nurture, natural reality vs. social
constructs and practices that human societies use in navigating
nature. Graham liked &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; as a less misleading
translation.</p>

<p>
Hansen noted that in philosophy of language contexts, philosophers
tended to use the normative modal discussed above, &lsquo;can
be&rsquo; (&#21487;<em>k&#283;</em> permissible/possible) not
<em>zh&#275;n</em>. Note the above translation of <em>Mozi</em> 10:172
uses &ldquo;is defective&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;is false&rdquo;.
Mozi&rsquo;s term is defined as not-<em>k&#283;</em>
(&#21487;permissible). Hansen doesn&rsquo;t deny that for millennia
Chinese have &ldquo;used language cooperatively in navigating the
natural world&rdquo;. However, their theory of how their language
relates to the world is a causal historical one expressed in simple
character terms, not via a proposition and truth-linked concept of
<em>meaning</em>. &ldquo;&hellip; language is a social practice. Its
basic function is guiding action&rdquo; (Hansen 1992: 3).</p>

<p>
Consider one particular doctrine that Hansen studied, the Mohist
formulation &#29275;&#39340;&#38750;&#39340;&#21487;
(<em>n&iacute;u</em> ox <em>m&#462;</em> horse <em>f&#275;i</em> is
not <em>m&#462;</em> horse <em>k&#283;</em> can/may!) (Hansen 1983).
Davidson would argue that if Hansen can understand that, he must be
able to translate it. Hansen doesn&rsquo;t disagree and translates it
as &ldquo;ox-horse not horse: acceptable/possible.&rdquo; Hansen
contends both that the Mohist formulation is true (in Wenyan) and that
the correct English translation is true. He also argues
&ldquo;white-horse not horse&rdquo; is false in both its Wenyan and
correct English translation form. He is committed to Davidson&rsquo;s
truth in L, objective truth. He is not, however, committed to the
claim that the Mohists are using semantic truth or committing
themselves to propositions or meanings. The mentioned string of
characters is permissible given the historical norms
(<em>d&agrave;o</em>) of use.</p>

<p>
Hansen translates the modal normative as <em>may be</em> rather than
Aristotle-to-Tarski&rsquo;s <em>truth</em>. However, following
Quine&rsquo;s insight (1960 [2013]), Hansen also understands and
translates the Mohist talk of oxen and horses using a conceptual
structure of parts and wholes, mereology, rather than sets and members
or particulars with properties and relations. The <em>fusion</em> of
the oxen <em>and</em> horses in a field <em>may not</em> include any
horse parts. Hansen notes that the Mohists acknowledge immediately
that it also <em>may</em> include horses and no oxen but neither is
assertible when neither oxen nor horses are in the field. The
Mohists&rsquo; inferences tell us more about their use of
<em>their</em> language terms. So, the Mohists&rsquo; formulations are
both translatable and true&mdash;but the conceptual scheme in which
they are expressed <em>and argued</em> is alien in the sense of
unfamiliar, but clearly philosophically sound and intelligible as a
natural way to describe a natural situation (Lewis 1991: 75).</p>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s argument, however, is not that conceptual schemes
cannot be alien, but that they cannot be so <em>radically
different</em> that they are uninterpretable and untranslatable. That
needn&rsquo;t concern Graham or Hansen&mdash;both of whom agree
philosophical translation is possible, so it is</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; possible to use one to criticize something in another, as
Fingarette uses Confucius to undermine our inner/outer dichotomy,
Rosemont the problematic of moral choice, Hall and Ames the concept of
transcendence. (Graham 1992: 78)
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Graham (1992: 68), conceptual schemes are not systems of
propositions but of language, &ldquo;a pre-logical pattern of names
&hellip; as the product of the classifying act of naming&rdquo;. Their
role is not merely to describe true and false states of affairs, but
to motivate insights and reasoning. So, especially in philosophy, the
inferential network of concepts used in a reflective discussion is
crucial to understanding the evolution of its philosophical
perspective. And this is a proper area of study for linguists,
sinologists and philosophers; indeed, for Graham and many others it is
an area <em>necessary</em> to study for discussing similarities and
differences cross-culturally with precision and clarity (Graham 1992:
69).</p>

<h3 id="HypRelLin">2.2 The Hypothesis of the Relativity of Linguistics</h3>

<p>
Another objection to our talk of an alternate concept scheme of the
classical texts is a version of the (presumably discredited)
&ldquo;Sapir-Whorf&rdquo; hypothesis of linguistic relativity.
Benjamin Lee Whorf and his teacher Edward Sapir say that language
determines our experience of the world: the way human beings perceive
the world in which they live is a function of the structure of the
native language(s) they acquire to describe and interact with it. In
Whorf&rsquo;s words,</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;[T]he grammar of each language is not merely a reproducing
instrument for voicing ideas but rather is itself the shaper of ideas,
the program and guide for the individual&rsquo;s
mental&hellip;development. (Whorf 1956: 212)
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that this claim differs from the above in being strongly
psychological, focused on the <em>individual&rsquo;s mental</em>
development. The assumptions above concern a philosophical community
working out how their language works. It is their <em>theory</em> of
<em>their</em> language that motivates a philosophical dialectic.
Their reasoning together <em>in their language</em> leads to theories
of human social practices, linguistic behavior in the natural world.
By contrast, Whorf&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong&rdquo; mental hypothesis
suggests that language structures more directly <em>determine</em>
<em>experiential or</em> mental content. This suggests he accepts
Aristotle&rsquo;s account of how alphabetic languages link to the
world, not the more naturalistic Chinese historical-conventional
account that links characters to parts of the natural world by
conventional practice learned by successive generations after some
&ldquo;sage&rdquo; coined the symbol. Nothing in the Chinese account
requires them to have different <em>experiences</em> or
<em>memories</em> of mountains and horses.</p>

<p>
Whorf&rsquo;s view is almost certainly correct <em>if we are
physicalists</em> about mental and cognitive content. We already can
prove that learning to play the violin or milk a cow produces changes
in the brain. It is hard to think that learning to read and write
Chinese does not. His wording, however, seems to assume mind-body
dualism and, as a result, become unverifiable since no one can
directly observe the subjective conscious content postulated by that
dualism. The neuro-physiological version of the hypothesis is
naturalistic enough, but we are barely beginning to understand the
science of the brain, certainly not relying on it in this entry.</p>

<p>
Our assumptions about philosophical matters in this interpretation
project are not unorthodox. We assume logic is a good tool for making
the meanings of texts more explicit, especially for tracking the
syntactic meanings that map out the conceptual-inferential field. We
assume science is the best available account of the shape of natural
reality. We are capable of learning others&rsquo; languages. Wenyan is
a language.</p>

<p>
It is only that final claim that is mildly controversial. We
acknowledge a possible quibble about whether written Wenyan is a
<em>natural</em> language, as well as doubts that it ever was a
<em>spoken</em> language or that there were ever children who acquired
the native-speaker authority in Wenyan we routinely grant native
speakers of living languages. Our position in these controversies is
like Zhuangzi&rsquo;s: Wenyan is a <em>natural</em> language but not a
natural <em>spoken</em> language.</p>

<p>
A more complicated if not mysterious situation obtains, however, when
we shift from simple naming to matters more syntactic. Examples are
Aristotelian conceptions of <em>being</em> (the verb &ldquo;to
be&rdquo;) and <em>event causation</em> (efficient and final),
familiar to students of Western philosophy. We share this heritage
with Europe and the Middle East, and it is easy to think of the
conceptual commitments as natural <em>human</em> starting points for
philosophical reflection. Both the reasoning motivating them and that
flowing from them, however, may not have any likely parallels in
ancient China. Although we can inter-translate talk of <em>to be</em>
and of <em>being</em> (&#26377; <em>y&#466;u</em> to have) and <em>not
being</em> (&#28961; <em>w&uacute;</em> to lack), we cannot formulate
in Wenyan any approximation of the ontological argument for God
without exposing the fallacy in it (Kurtz 2011: 84&ndash;88).</p>

<p>
This is the point made by Wittgenstein, not Whorf.
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s hypothesis concerned philosophy, not the
&ldquo;private language&rdquo; of mentalist psychology, the unfolding
of an undominated discourse, not the dance of supposed objects in
one&rsquo;s mind. He said, &ldquo;Philosophy is a battle against the
bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.&rdquo; His point
wasn&rsquo;t that language itself was the source of philosophical
confusion, but that our theories of language, like Aristotle&rsquo;s,
convey <em>pictures</em> that are confusing. And because over
centuries dualism becomes a &ldquo;folk ideology&rdquo; of language
processing that our teachers convey to us as they train us in our
language use, Europeans are launched on a confusing system of
metaphysics and epistemology that is taken for granted in talking
about language and meaning. Wittgenstein targeted particularly some of
Aristotle&rsquo;s assumptions. We have already visited a downstream
result of this&mdash;the idea theory (see
 <a href="#ChiCha">&sect;1.1</a>)
 of <em>mentalese</em>&mdash;an inner psychological version of Chinese
writing. Aristotle further initiates a theory of meaning as expressed
in definitions. (Aristotle <em>Topics</em> Book I Part 4). These fix
the reference of words, and determine the truth value of assertions,
and ground our concepts of <em>meanings</em>, <em>thoughts</em> and
<em>beliefs</em> (propositional entities).</p>

<p>
The moral here is an extension of Davidson&rsquo;s point. However
different our language schemes may be, there are ways of expressing
<em>facts</em> about <em>nature</em> that use measurement with
instruments that, with increasing accuracy, ground descriptions on
which humans with any natural language that includes arithmetic can
and do agree. Further, as we saw, classical Chinese had the full range
of logical connectives and operators and valid reasoning with these
and the measurement-derived facts should still preserve
<em>truth</em>. Different languages, grammars and conceptual schemes
may tempt users into different philosophical conundrums, but logic and
science should still work for all cultures.</p>

<p>
Science was arguably a Western discovery, but as we have discovered in
recent decades, Chinese intellectuals are perfectly capable of
learning and deploying it while still inheriting the philosophical
tradition and language they have. We have not seen any barriers to
making the two languages fully intertranslatable when philosophical
and scientific confusions are resolved. No true statement in one can
turn out to be false in its correct translation into the other.</p>

<h2 id="WhyIntChiPhiTex">3. Why Interrogate Chinese Philosophical Texts?</h2>

<h3 id="Int">3.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>
There are almost as many answers to this question as there are
comparative philosophers working in the field of Chinese thought.
Herein we may cover only a few of them as illustrative of more general
trends and tendencies. Moreover, the reader must bear in mind that a
great many translations and accounts of Chinese philosophy have been
and still are made by non-philosophers, adding more answers to the
question of why the texts are deemed worthy of interrogation than can
be taken up herein.</p>

<p>
Despite the multiplicity of appropriate responses to the question,
however, the reasons for asking it basically reduce to two, and they
hold not only for Chinese writings, but all foreign philosophical
texts. We translate and interpret them in order to (1) learn more
about the people in the culture whence the text came; and/or (2) to
learn more about ourselves and our own culture. That is to say, most
texts worthy of translation and exegesis are both windows on the
culture that produced them and mirrors of our own.</p>

<p>
There are numerous ways these goals can be achieved individually, and
together, depending on the nature of the approach to the texts. First
we will examine briefly the interrogation of Chinese texts against the
background of the problems, patterns of argument and standards of
rational justification in the Western philosophical tradition; its
&ldquo;grammar&rdquo;, so to speak (Makeham 2012: xii). The governing
idea is that although surely different, Chinese thinkers have enough
in common with their Western counterparts to make associative and
contrastive comparisons between them and/or their ideas a useful
method of engagement with the text.</p>

<p>
Then, in
 <a href="#ConApp">&sect;3.3</a>
 the texts are interrogated a little differently, with the governing
idea being something like a &ldquo;hermeneutics of suspicion&rdquo; in
reverse. With this approach the &ldquo;grammar&rdquo; of the Western
philosophical tradition is downplayed as far as possible, the exegetes
and translators believing that it distorts the Chinese materials by
overwriting them with distinctly Western concerns; we should not look
for theodicean writings in a culture without a concept of an all-good
creator God. Instead of asking &ldquo;To what extent do these texts
suggest answers to philosophical questions that vex us?&rdquo; they
tend to ask, &ldquo;To what extent do these texts suggest we might ask
different philosophical questions?&rdquo; Finally, in
 <a href="#ChiApp">&sect;3.4</a>
 we will sketch quickly the <em>problematik</em> of Chinese
philosophers in China, and how and why it overlaps only slightly at
present with the Western approaches.</p>

<h3 id="ComApp">3.2 The Comparative Approach</h3>

<p>
For the great majority of Anglophone and European comparative
philosophers of China the Western philosophical heritage is the basis
for the comparisons. This may or may not be regrettable, but is in
some measure unavoidable because it is obviously the more familiar
tradition and the ground of the comparativist&rsquo;s views. It is
hard to imagine any scholar essaying a translation of a text without
some knowledge of what it&rsquo;s about, and its importance, and for
philosophers that &ldquo;aboutness&rdquo; and importance stem from
conceptions drawn from the translator&rsquo;s own philosophical
training, which is the kernel from which the interpretation will grow.
Obviously close and careful readings of the text can
alter&mdash;perhaps significantly&mdash;the original interpretation
given to it, but an interpretation of some kind we tend to have at all
times when working with a Chinese classical text (or any other).</p>

<p>
Some texts wear their interpretations pretty much on their sleeves; it
is hard to interpret the &ldquo;Legalist&rdquo; <em>Hanfeizi</em> text
as a Confucian treatise because of the extent to which it is a
criticism thereof, championing a system of regulations and laws that
was an anathema to the Master. Most Chinese classical texts are not,
however, of this kind, as we should already expect from our earlier
discussion about the classical language. They require a good deal of
interpretive analysis and evaluation. Almost none of them are pure,
the work of a single author and unaffected by the vagaries of history
or the ravages of time. They are composites, with fragments of several
texts often strung together by we-know-not-who, then burned in large
quantities during the bibliographic holocaust of 213 BCE and the
destruction of the libraries during the civil war that followed soon
afterward; with remaining copies re-assembled&mdash;again by unknown
hands&mdash;and that is generally the way they have come down to us.
Greater understanding of several texts has come from unearthing very
old copies of them written on bamboo or silk at recently excavated
archaeological sites, particularly those at Mawangdui in Hunan and
Guodian in Hubei; but it remains that virtually every work we have
today is more or less corrupt.</p>

<p>
The composite nature of most texts also means there can be no tidy
classification system for them either, nor even for their parts at
times: labelling this chapter of a text Daoist, or Mohist, and that
one more or less Confucian, ignores the fact that there were a large
number of ideas current in the classical period, with different
thinkers adopting and adapting them in different ways. We may speak of
lineages&mdash;the followers of a particularly gifted
teacher&mdash;but few scholars any longer think of clear and distinct
philosophical &ldquo;schools&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
One highly composite text&mdash;both ideologically and
temporally&mdash;is the <em>Analects</em> of Confucius, a long string
of abbreviated statements by or about Confucius and his students, not
put into its present form until at least two centuries after he died
in 479 BCE (Kim and Csikszentmilhalyi 2014). Most translations and
exegeses of the text place great emphasis on his ethics, and those of
his successors, especially Mencius. They have been interpreted against
the background of consequentialism (Im 2011); Christianity (Legge 1871
[1960]); and Kantianism (many mainland scholars ever since Liang
Qichao and his student Mou Zongsan a century ago); as virtue ethics,
Aristotelian and otherwise (most comparativists working in the field
today; see Tiwald 2010); as character ethics (Kupperman 2004); as one
among several &ldquo;natural moralities&rdquo;, the functions of which
are to facilitate and regulate social cooperation and to foster a
reasonable degree of coherence among the individual&rsquo;s
potentially conflicting motivations (Wong 2006); or their views have
been addressed against the background of differing strands of feminist
ethics (Raphals 1998; Li 2000; Wang 2003; Rosenlee 2007).</p>

<p>
It would be a mistake to ask which of these readings of the
<em>Analects</em> or the early Confucians in general is the correct
one. In the first place, we must note that all of the ethical theories
save one are Western, and the questions focus on which one best fits
with early Confucian writings. Even more basically, <em>the concept of
ethics as a delimitable field of philosophy is itself Western</em>,
not Chinese, which problematizes even more the question of
&ldquo;correctness&rdquo;. Consequently, the translator/exegete must
constantly guard against reading out of the text simply what he or she
has read into it. Rather obviously Confucius and his successors could
not hold all these ethical positions, and perhaps they didn&rsquo;t
hold any of them, or any ethical theory at all. These interpretations
can&rsquo;t possibly all be right, and more probably they are all of
them wrong in at least some respects.</p>

<p>
Indeed, perhaps even to suggest right and wrong is wrong here. If the
reader wants only to know what the statements in the <em>Analects</em>
originally meant to those who first heard them then all these
philosophical readings must be suspect in some degree. A more purely
narrative and less analytic/evaluative approach is called for. Asking
how much like Aristotle the sayings of Mencius may be is different
from ascertaining how King Liang heard them when Mencius supposedly
first spoke to him.</p>

<p>
Answering the latter question is more often done by sinologists with
disciplinary training other than philosophy, in which the issues are
more philological, etymological and historical (see Brooks and Brooks
2001), but a number of philosophers have well served the profession by
focusing heavily on the translation rather than exegetical side of
comparative work, saving their exegetical remarks, if any, for
introductions or notes. An older example is D.C. Lau&rsquo;s <em>Tao
Te Ching</em> (1963), and newer ones include Eric Hutton&rsquo;s
<em>Xunzi</em> (2014) and Brook Ziporyn&rsquo;s <em>Zhuangzi</em>
(2020). Again, textual problems arising from this kind of activity
tend to be more philological and historical than exegetical or
philosophical, even though the texts are basically philosophical.</p>

<p>
Both questions, however, are important ones with respect to
translation and textual exegesis, for both can generate significant
insights. Asking whether Confucius may be legitimately construed as a
closet consequentialist, or feminist, can enlarge the reader&rsquo;s
view of these ethical orientations, as well as illuminate a number of
dimensions of the Master&rsquo;s views. On the other hand, striving to
give an account of a thinker or group of thinkers at the time they
lived allows readers more conceptual room to form their own judgements
about the value of the views in the translation and/or exegesis.</p>

<p>
We may see the same points with another type of comparative textual
scholarship done philosophically, examining similarities and
differences between a specific Chinese and a specific Western thinker.
One might take two intellectual giants from their cultures and
juxtapose them, like Aristotle and Confucius (Sim 2007; Yu 2007;
Ivanhoe 2014). Or investigate how much like Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
anti-rationalist reaction to Hegel is Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism
about reason (Carr and Ivanhoe 2000). Or choose two disparate thinkers
and employ new comparative practices to elucidate some ostensibly
similar concepts in differing cultural contexts (Yearley 1990).</p>

<p>
What can be learned from such studies? Taking the Aristotle/Confucius
comparisons, we learn just how much weight Confucius gave to rituals,
family, customs and traditions as prerequisite for flourishing
personal lives and social harmony, for example. The weight grows even
heavier when we reflect that Aristotle said almost nothing about
rituals, family, customs and traditions, though he dealt in great
detail with great sensitivity in virtually all aspects of human life
personal and social. By his silence on ritual matters he obliges us to
look at Confucius&rsquo;s insistence on those dimensions of human life
again. He was <em>deeply</em> concerned with ritual performance; why?
In the same way we may obtain new insights into Aristotelianism: there
are libraries full of commentaries on the writings of Aristotle
gathered over the past two millennia, but it is doubtful that any of
them commented on the significance of the absence of any concern with
ritual matters in those writings. By placing Confucius alongside him
the lacuna quickly becomes obvious, and invites our contemplation.</p>

<p>
We might look upon Aristotle&rsquo;s relatively laconic remarks on the
nature of habituation (in <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> II)&mdash;that
we become virtuous by performing virtuous actions&mdash;as a potential
bridge to Confucius&rsquo;s deep concern for ritual. The bridge is a
focus on how virtue must be cultivated and embodied through action. In
the case of Confucius, the action is affectively expressive: serving
one&rsquo;s parents cannot be mere material support but express
respect (<em>Analects</em> 2.7&ndash;8). Some interpreters of
Aristotle have filled in his lack of specificity on habituation by
discussing how virtuous action might afford the learner certain kinds
of affective experience and by pointing out that intensified affective
experience can sharpen the perception and cognition that goes into the
intensional object of that experience.</p>

<p>
For example, Sherman (1991) in articulating this line of thought for
Aristotle points out that compassionate experience can help the
learner discriminate aspects of a situation that call for specific
forms of compassionate response according to the nature of the
misfortune suffered by the other. One learns greater discernment not
through mechanical repetition but through practice and watching and
being tutored by the more experienced who come closer to getting it
right&mdash;both the situation and the response to it. At the same
time, swinging back to Confucius, one might also see how practiced
performance of ritual might encourage greater discernment of aspects
of the situation that call for adjustment of how one performs a ritual
on a given occasion. One serves one&rsquo;s parents according to
ritual, but when in <em>Analects</em> 2.6 Confucius says that one
should give one&rsquo;s parents nothing to worry about beyond
one&rsquo;s physical well-being, one is obviously called upon to
exercise judgment about what aspects of one&rsquo;s conduct and
attitude would be causes for worry.</p>

<p>
One might observe these kinds of resonance and yet note that there
must be something quite different about a philosophical tradition that
weds practice and perceiving and responding in the right ways through
ritual, family, social customs and traditions, and a philosophical
tradition that calls for such practice without comparable emphasis on
any of these things. The former views development of the individual as
always taking place within a social matrix. It holds that
understanding what makes development go well requires attention to the
ongoing viability of the matrix itself. It requires attention, for
example, to the rituals that make sense of and give structure to the
interactions of everyday life, such as greeting others and taking
meals with them, and others that mark life passages such as birth,
coming of age, marriage, and death. It means attention to whether
these rituals embody and help participants to be aware of and express
the underlying affective and cognitive attitudes that bring
individuals into fruitful relationship with each other, to more fully
realize the values of their common life. The Confucius of the
<em>Analects</em> shows grave concern that the rituals of his time had
badly deteriorated and had come to express self-aggrandizement and
dominance by the powerful rather than respect and concern (hence the
stress in 13.3 on the need to rectify the names or
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> of social roles). This is often at least part of
what is meant by saying that a much more relational conception of the
person comes through in many Confucian texts.</p>

<p>
To the extent that the interpreter becomes sympathetic to the
Confucian emphasis on the social matrix, the conclusion may be that
there is something important missing from the Western perspective that
supposedly anchors the comparison. It intersects with another
interpretive approach outlined in the next section, the contrastive
approach, which might take a relatively distinctive feature of Chinese
philosophy and interrogate the Western tradition for what might now be
arguably perceived as a lack. It is important to stress
<em>arguably</em> because emphasis on the role of the social matrix
embedded within a society&rsquo;s traditions may be subject to
normative critique as being insufficiently self-critical. In fact,
this critique may be present within the larger Chinese philosophical
tradition, as exemplified by the Mohist critique of Confucians for
valuing tradition for tradition&rsquo;s sake (see Hansen 1992:
107&ndash;108). Whether the Mohist critique is fully fair to
Confucians, or at least to some Confucians, is subject to debate,
which will cover issues such as the extent to which it is possible to
transcend the normative presuppositions of a tradition or whether one
must in the end resort to critiquing some aspects of a tradition from
the standpoint of other aspects of the tradition. Notice, however,
that the center of gravity of the debate has now shifted over to the
Chinese side, a not-unwelcome development for those who have noted
that cross-traditional comparisons tend to asymmetrically be centered
on the Western side.</p>

<p>
Another dimension of the comparative approach involves focusing on a
specific audience for the comparativist&rsquo;s translation work and
commentary. If we believe the <em>Mozi</em> resembles Utilitarianism
in many respects for instance, the writings of Bentham and Mill can
serve well as the interpretive framework for our efforts. The specific
syntactic patterns and lexical items we employ, however, plus notes
and commentary, will be somewhat different if we are basically writing
for a general audience of undergraduates or the general reader than if
we are trying to engage other philosophers of a Utilitarian persuasion
in <em>dialogue</em> about the contribution(s) the Mohist views can
make to more sophisticated development of the views of Bentham and
Mill (Angle 2014: 229). And with only minor caveats, the same may be
said for exegeses of the text in comparative contexts. It may be
pointed out that Mohists developed a sophisticated form of indirect
consequentialism that is not to be found in Western utilitarianism
until well after Bentham and Mill (Fraser 2016: 19).</p>

<p>
Many comparative philosophers also do strict exegeses no less than
comparative ones, focusing on simply explicating, against a
philosophical background, the dominant views of a person,
&ldquo;school&rdquo;, text or concept. Examples of each are Leo
Chang&rsquo;s <em>The Philosophical Foundations of Han Fei&rsquo;s
Political Theory</em> (1986), Hans-Georg Moeller&rsquo;s <em>Daoism
Explained</em> (2011), Moeller and Paul D&rsquo;Ambrosio&rsquo;s
<em>Genuine Pretending: On the Philosophy of the Zhuangzi</em>
<em>(2017),</em> Hellmut Wilhelm&rsquo;s <em>Heaven, Earth and Man in
the Book of Changes</em> (1977), Brook Ziporyn&rsquo;s <em>Ironies of
Oneness and Difference: Coherence in Early Chinese Thought</em>
(2013), and Kim-Chong Chong&rsquo;s <em>Zhuangzi&rsquo;s Critique of
the Confucians: Blinded by the Human</em> <em>(2016).</em></p>

<h3 id="ConApp">3.3 The Contrastive Approach</h3>

<p>
The comparative approach to exegesis in Chinese philosophy obviously
leaves much room for consideration of differences as well, which are
often as illuminating as the similarities, and at times even more so.
This approach also tends to enrich philosophy overall by increasing
its scope, reach, and capacity for self-correction; there is no better
cure for culture-boundedness than steeping oneself in another culture.
And in that way&mdash;as well as many others&mdash;comparative
philosophers of China may hope to engage in fruitful dialogue with
other philosophers ignorant of non-Western cultures in general,
Chinese in particular.</p>

<p>
All of these laudable consequences of the comparative approach
notwithstanding, there is another way to interrogate Chinese texts
which merits attention because it is equally capable of illuminating
them. This latter approach places the Western tradition more in the
background while engaged in research, interpretive and translation
efforts. That is to say, the translating philosopher must be open to
the text as it is, not within the contexts determined by the nature of
the questions addressed to it in the vocabulary of Western philosophy.
This critical stance is not urging philosophers to approach a text as
a <em>tabula rasa</em>, for such cannot be done. It is to urge that
philosophers attend very carefully to the lexicon for translating
Chinese into English, for that lexicon may be construed as a
<em>theory</em> of sorts, and an increasingly poor one; it is a theory
that Chinese philosophy is pretty much like Western philosophy, and
consequently the vocabulary of the one can be carried over to the
other without undue distortion (Hansen 1992: 17).</p>

<p>
But no translation is innocent, nor any interpretation. The form of
our questions determines the range of the possible answers we can
obtain. Thus, if we ask what view of the inner life Confucius held, we
almost certainly will not be able to see that perhaps he didn&rsquo;t
hold any such view, or even think about having an &ldquo;inner
life,&rdquo; if such a life is taken to be dichotomous with or
exclusive of, an outer, &ldquo;objective and material life&rdquo;, as Herbert
Fingarette argued in his famous book on the Master (Fingarette 1972).
Asking which theory of propositional truth early Daoists held makes it
difficult to see, as Hansen argued, that the early Daoists (and all
other early Chinese thinkers) had little interest in propositional
truth, but were interested rather in language as praxis-guiding
behavior, as we noted earlier
 (<a href="#VerIdeDifConSch">&sect;2.1</a>,
 and will take up again in
 <a href="#TraSouSil">&sect;4.3</a>
 ). There are multiple cosmologies in Western philosophy, beginning
with the several put forth by the Greeks, all of them conforming to a
logical order. But we shouldn&rsquo;t ask which one of them early
Chinese cosmology most nearly resembles, if Hall and Ames are right in
claiming that Chinese cosmology is best described as an
<em>aesthetic</em> order not a logical one (Hall &amp; Ames 1987: 16).
It might be that the early Confucians didn&rsquo;t have <em>any</em>
ethical theory, but based their descriptions, analyses and evaluations
of human activity on the basis of their roles (Rosemont and Ames 2009;
Ames 2011; Rosemont 2015). Even those who argue that roles do not
exhaust Confucian conceptions of the person might agree that, per the
discussion in the previous section, roles as part of the social matrix
play a much more prominent role in those conceptions both of what
persons are and how they develop. Both the comparative and contrastive
approaches can lay the groundwork for new interpretations of concepts
such as virtue. Whereas complaints against interpreting Confucian
ethics as a virtue ethics rest at least partly on the assumption that
virtues are qualities of individuals conceived in separation from
others who are in relationship to them or from the social roles they
occupy, an appreciation of the social matrix in how individuals
conceive of their own identities as crucially involving (if not
reducible to) relationship and social role can lead to an appreciation
of at least some virtues as being relational in nature. That is, the
virtues cannot be specified except in the context of a particular kind
of relationship, e.g., friendship, parent-child (Um 2020).</p>

<p>
These suggestions clearly do not fit well with the standard
&ldquo;grammar&rdquo; and presuppositions of the Western philosophical
tradition. It makes no sense to ask what contribution Chinese thought
can make to the mind-body problem if the dichotomy is altogether
absent from their writings, nor to seek light on the nature of
propositional truth if its propositional content was not a factor in
their thinking about language. Such absences have been debated. At the
very least, debates over the absence from Chinese thought of a concept
of truth that applies to propositions, or of any kind of distinction
between mind and body, can lead to finer distinctions regarding these
matters. See Fraser 2012 on the primacy of concern in Chinese thought
for the pragmatic guidance of discourse if not the complete absence of
truth-like utterances. See Goldin 2003 and Slingerland 2013 for
arguments that there was a distinction between mind and body in
Chinese thought, and
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-mind">Mind (Heart-Mind) in Chinese Philosophy</a>
 for the possibility that mind and body may be distinguished according
to their different functions within the person even if they are
composed of the same psycho-physical <em>qi</em> or
&ldquo;breath-energy.&rdquo; Such debates should also remind us that
the Western thought is not of one voice on such fundamental
distinctions and that there are strains within this diverse and
contentious tradition that resonate with such proposed interpretations
of Chinese thought.</p>

<p>
These possibilities for more complicated resonances between the
traditions may constitute an answer to a worry about the contrastive
approach to the effect that it reduces the opportunities for
comparative philosophers to engage in genuine dialogue with their
Western-oriented brethren, and makes it easier to continue using the
shibboleth that Chinese thought &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t really
philosophy&rdquo;. On the other hand, the contrasters will insist that
the comparative approach robs the Chinese of their own voice, forcing
them into a philosophical milieu that is not theirs. This can be seen
in the frequency with which the comparisons tend to be asymmetrical:
when something is lacking, or an argument missing, or some other
deficit is seen, the Chinese side is at fault. But the plausibility of
the charge rests almost solely on assuming the Western definition of
the problem and approach to it. And in the end, just how plausible is
it to think that all the <em>real</em> problems of philosophy, and all
the methods for dealing with them, have been advanced in a single
civilization? Seeing how the relationship between language and world
or between mind and body have been dealt with in the Chinese tradition
may invigorate both traditions.</p>

<p>
These sketches of the comparative and contrastive approaches to the
exegesis of Chinese philosophical texts have been just that: sketches;
there are many more examples of each kind, and a number of comparative
philosophers combine the two. And it must be remembered that much work
has been done by scholars not trained in philosophy, increasing the
number of ways of approaching the texts. Good exemplars of the variety
of approaches to the field are introductory works on Chinese
philosophy, which tend to combine both some comparative and
contrastive elements and differ in thrust as their authors foreground
the <em>Chinese</em> elements, or emphasize <em>philosophy</em>
(especially analytic) in their narratives. Two examples of the former
are Lai 2017 and Wen 2012; coming down more firmly on the philosophy
side are Van Norden 2011 and Liu 2006. The field is thus fairly fluid
as it continues to come into its own, which readers should celebrate
and not bemoan because of the variety of perspectives on the Chinese
tradition on offer, all based on solid scholarly work from one
discipline or another. We shall return briefly to these issues in
 <a href="#TraSouSil">&sect;4.3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Sometimes an interpretive work can straddle the comparative and
contrastive approaches. Fingarette&rsquo;s 1972 book is best-known for
its introduction of ritual to contemporary Western philosophy, and for
articulating the ethically salient reasons for its importance. These
issues are pertinent to the issue discussed in section 3.2 above as to
the social matrix that might be missing from the Aristotelian concept
of habituation.</p>

<h3 id="ChiApp">3.4 The Chinese Approach</h3>

<p>
Chinese scholars working in the field of Chinese philosophy have much
in common with their Western peers, but the differences are even
greater, at least at present. In the first place, with few exceptions
the Chinese would not see themselves as comparativists. They will read
closely comparative works on Aristotle and Confucius, but basically
for what they can learn about the latter, not the former. This is not
chauvinism. To be concerned with how Confucius might illuminate the
thought of Aristotle is to do philosophy, but not <em>Chinese</em>
philosophy, and that is what they are engaged upon.</p>

<p>
Confucianism looms large in their work. Some scholars are working with
Daoist and other texts unearthed from Mawangdui and elsewhere (Cao
Feng), and a few are essaying Chinese themes against a Western model
(Yang Guorong). But Confucianism is still seen as the embodiment and
expression of Chinese culture and is enjoying a renaissance of
interest and scholarship&mdash;and general popularity&mdash;not seen
since the May 4<sup>th</sup> Movement of 1919. A few Chinese
philosophers are asking what contribution Confucianism might make to
philosophy in a global context, but most of them are concentrating on
its relevance to China today&mdash;and tomorrow.</p>

<p>
A second difference between Chinese philosophers and Western
comparativists is that the Chinese do their work in accordance with
their own &ldquo;grammar&rdquo;, their own questions, definitions of
problems, methodology, patterns of argument and standards of
justification. They, too, have inherited a tradition over two
millennia old, with a monumental amount of material&mdash;there are
over 8000 commentaries on the <em>Analects</em> alone&mdash;but the
questions and problems are seldom those of the West, except in those
sections of university philosophy departments that specialize in
Western philosophy. and there are not inconsequential differences in
methodology, patterns of arguments and styles of justification as
well.</p>

<p>
Among the questions contemporary Chinese scholars are asking is the
extent to which Confucianism might legitimately be considered a
religion. Are there resources in the texts to suggest making it a
state religion? (Kang Xiaoguang.) Shouldn&rsquo;t the focus be on
spiritual practice, not theory? (Pang Fei.) What kind of constitution
best reflects Confucianism in today&rsquo;s world? (Jiang Qing 2012;
Tongdong Bai 2019.) Is Confucianism better studied today against the
background of Western philosophy? (Zhang Longxi.) Or must it be
studied in its own cultural context? (Zhang Xianglong.)</p>

<p>
This is important work, which clearly has much of political as well as
philosophical import, although the politics do not seem to be inspired
by nationalism of any sort (recapturing cultural pride is clearly in
evidence, however). Some of it will appear conservative to Western
eyes, as when the editor of an anthology on <em>The Renaissance of
Confucianism in Contemporary China</em> says that &ldquo;One finds in
these essays &hellip; only sparse attention to the Western notion of
human rights&rdquo; (Fan 2011: 2). Others envisage a
&ldquo;progressive&rdquo; Confucianism (Angle 2012: 1), which,
unsurprisingly, includes more Western elements. The bulk of
contemporary philosophical scholarship in China is not, however, of
much direct interest to Western philosophers (or the general public),
which is why there is such a disparity between translations of work
done by the comparativists into Chinese (a lot) and Chinese
scholarship rendered into English (comparatively little). The Chinese
can and do study the work of their Western counterparts fairly
closely, largely for the insights that work provides on their own
tradition. Coming the other way we have significantly less work in
English: the political text of Jiang Qing (2012), works on aesthetics
and in the history of Chinese thought that brings it into relation to
Kant and Marx by Li Zehou (2006, 2009, 2018, 2019, 2023, 2025), and
development of Confucian concept of <em>Tianxia</em> (All Under
Heaven) in application to the contemporary phenomena of globalization
and the normative discourse of cosmopolitanism by Zhao Tingyang
(2020). Other important forms in which those based in Western
traditions can receive input from the Chinese are articles in
specialized anthologies (Fan 2011) or journals of translation
(<em>Contemporary Chinese Thought</em>, <em>The Journal of Chinese
Humanities</em>). In sum, textual exegesis and translation in Chinese
philosophy is a cultural practice, but it is usually practiced
differently in different cultures. The situation is changing slowly,
with more work coming from Chinese philosophers appearing in
English.</p>

<p>
Finally, a signal development is the work of those whose approaches
are fully within neither the Chinese nor the Western tradition but a
hybrid of these traditions. Joseph Chan, born and raised in Hong Kong,
earned a D.Phil. at Oxford. Sungmoon Kim, born and raised in South
Korea, earned his Ph.D. in political science at the University of
Maryland at College Park. Both have proposed blends of Confucianism
and democracy that have attracted significant attention. Daniel A.
Bell, by contrast, a Canadian who was educated at McGill and Oxford
but taught and held administrative roles in Chinese universities,
defends (2014) a contemporary Chinese meritocratic model of governance
with democracy at the local levels that clearly has its roots in
Confucianism. Aaron Stalnaker (2006, 2019) and Michael Ing (2012,
2017) have utilized &ldquo;bridge concepts&rdquo;, such as human nature, spiritual
exercises, vulnerability, and integrity, as a tool for comparative and
contrastive work, meant to facilitate organization of disparate themes
within traditions and to create dialogues across traditions. They draw
from contemporary Chinese scholars and Western scholars in these
dialogues.</p>

<h2 id="MethIss">4. Methodological Issues</h2>

<h3 id="GenCulPhi">4.1 On Generalizations Cultural and Philosophical</h3>

<p>
Deciding whether to be basically narrative or dialogical is probably
the first issue facing the exegete. Another issue interpreters of
Chinese texts must take into consideration in advancing their
positions is the extent to which one may make generalizations about
Chinese civilization and culture writ large.</p>

<p>
This question arises because the conceptual categories within which
Chinese authors thought and wrote differ sufficiently from
contemporary English-readers&rsquo; that the former will be very
difficult to understand, at least at first perusal, without being
placed in a larger cultural and philosophical conceptual framework. If
Western scholars are inclined to shudder when they hear sweeping
generalizations about the history of Western culture and philosophy,
knowing how diverse they really have been and are, we should perhaps
want to embrace the Golden Rule, and do unto other cultures what we
would have done with our own. The generalizations can be highly
misleading, as a number of sinologists have been arguing recently.</p>

<p>
This is a perplexing problem. If we do not generalize to the larger
milieu in which a particular text is placed it is difficult to
appreciate either what it says or the significance it has in the
culture that grew it. But if the best we can do&mdash;like a number of
late 19<sup>th</sup>-century German scholars&mdash;is characterize
China as a land of <em>ewigen Stillstand</em> (&lsquo;eternal
standstill&rsquo;) we are surely better off with no generalizations
whatsoever; making vague or erroneous generalizations tends to
stereotypes, and there are already a superfluity of these for China,
from Charlie Chan to Fu Manchu.</p>

<p>
Thus the historian Michael Puett warns us that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All of these interpretive strategies&mdash;reading in terms of
schools, essentialized definitions of culture, evolutionary
frameworks&mdash;have the consequence of erasing the unique power that
particular claims had at the time,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and recommends that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we dispense with &hellip; frameworks&hellip; [and] &hellip; should
instead work on a more nuanced approach&hellip;. (Puett 2004:
23&ndash;25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other side is the Shang Dynasty historian David Keightley, who
believes it important to essay major generalizations and who addressed
the issue by asking &ldquo;What made China Chinese?&rdquo; (Keightley
2014). The reader of that paper will see that in addressing the grand
question Keightley throws light on another, closer to home: what makes
us &ldquo;us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Yet Puett was not simply crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;. A disturbingly
large number of scholars have made generalizations that were not
simply misleading in their consequences, but have had racist, or
&ldquo;orientalist&rdquo; undertones, or, more commonly, have just
been plain flat-out wrong. To take only a few more egregious examples,
although not a trained sinologist, Kant studied China and lectured on
Chinese thought in his geography classes, including statements that
Confucius taught nothing but manners for the elite, and referred to
the views of the <em>Daodejing</em> as &ldquo;the monster system of
Laotse&rdquo;; generalizing his remarks to claim that &ldquo;a concept
of virtue and morality never entered the heads of the Chinese&rdquo;
(Ching 1978: 168&ndash;169). These examples could be multiplied many
times over, and are not relics from the past:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It can be argued that almost every change China has ever undergone
originated from abroad or because of some foreign stimulus. (Deeker
2013: 70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is an additional reason for eschewing generalizations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If there is one valid generalization about China, it is that China
defies generalization. Chinese civilization is simply to huge, too
diverse and too old for neat maxims. (Goldin 2008: 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Undercutting the image of a multimillennia, monolithic static culture
is certainly a good thing, politically as well as intellectually.
Arguably more nonsense and worse has been written about China than any
other non-Western culture, and it is ongoing, as above. But perhaps we
should not eschew generalizations about China altogether. Shifting the
angle of vision only very slightly Roger Ames gave an important
rejoinder to the anti-generalizers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I would maintain that the only thing more dangerous than striving to
make responsible cultural generalizations is failing to make
them&hellip; Philosophical interpreters must sensitize the student of
Chinese philosophy to the ambient uncommon assumptions that have made
the Chinese philosophical narrative so different from our own. (Ames
2011: 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps Keightley should have the last word on this issue. As
justification for his asking &ldquo;What makes the Chinese
Chinese?&rdquo; he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Chinese, after all, have probably fed more people more
successfully than any or other culture in world history. How they
developed the social capital to do this is well worth our study.
(Keightley 2014: 83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given that it is nigh unto impossible to give an interpretation of a
text without making generalizations that go considerably beyond it, we
should give the nod to the pros rather than the cons in this
particular debate, but the latter perform the salutary function of
warning students to take the generalizations lightly at all times, and
abandon them for others in the light of further study.</p>

<h3 id="TraTru">4.2 Translating the Truth</h3>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s focus on propositional truth
 (<a href="#VerIdeDifConSch">&sect;2.1</a>
 above) is altogether in keeping with the concern of most
20<sup>th</sup>-century Anglophone philosophers to analyze language as
the main means of communicating facts about the world to our fellow
human beings. When the facts are indeed as communicated, we say the
statements expressing them are &ldquo;true&rdquo;. The precise nature
of the relation between the facts and the statements of them has
generated different theories of truth&mdash;correspondence, coherence,
pragmatic, semantic, even &ldquo;deflationary&rdquo;&mdash;with the
question remaining an open one today, although fewer philosophers are
pursuing an answer to it.</p>

<p>
No matter which theory one adopts, elaborating this concept of
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; involves a cluster of related concepts:
<em>sentence, proposition, statement, fact, semantics, reference,
connotation, denotation</em>, plus a few others. There is another
conception of &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, however, where the direct conveying
of information is not central to the definition, and consequently
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is also conceived somewhat differently. Other
uses of language might be equally or more important for some
philosophers. Remember Chad Hansen&rsquo;s claim
 (<a href="#VerIdeDifConSch">&sect;2.1</a>)
 that <em>all</em> of the early Chinese philosophers held that
&ldquo;language is a social practice. Its basic function is guiding
discourse&rdquo; (Hansen 1992: 3). If so, then the standard
translation of the graph <em>zhi</em> as &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;
becomes problematic, if it is identified with &ldquo;justified true
belief&rdquo;. Rosemont argues that &ldquo;We are inclined to focus on
the informative uses of language, that is, the transmission of
<em>knowledge that.</em>&rdquo; On his account readers will profit
more if <em>zhi</em> is translated as &ldquo;realize&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, following Hall and Ames (1987). &ldquo;If
&lsquo;to personalize&rsquo; means &lsquo;to make personal&rsquo;,
then &lsquo;to realize&rsquo; is &lsquo;to make real&rsquo; in the
sense of <em>knowing how, knowing about, knowing to</em>&rdquo;
(Rosemont 2012: 47). Much the same thing has been noted by Stephen
Angle and Justin Tiwald in their book on Neo-Confucianism, in which
they say they will focus on &ldquo;knowledge as an activity rather
than knowledge as a set of truths&rdquo; (Angle &amp; Tiwald 2017: 5,
1).</p>

<p>
This, too, may be construed as &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, even though not
propositional, and with a different concept-cluster around it:
<em>authenticity</em>, <em>engagement</em>, <em>trustworthy</em>,
<em>integrity</em>, <em>honesty</em>, <em>upright</em>, and more. In
2014 a symposium celebrating the inauguration of a new online journal
of cross-cultural philosophy (<em>Confluence</em>, 1.1) was devoted to
the question of whether the concept of truth was useful in the pursuit
of cross-cultural philosophical research. The four symposiasts
represented Japanese philosophy, Confucianism, Aztec philosophy and
Tibetan Buddhism. None of them found close approximations for
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; in the propositional sense in the cultures they
studied, but all four said there were analogues for the terms
associated with truth as &ldquo;truthfulness&rdquo; in the lexicons of
the thinkers and traditions they worked with. This non-propositional
sense of truth is of course not unknown in the West; everyone
understands what V&aacute;clav Havel meant when he entitled an
anthology of his essays <em>Living in Truth</em> (1990). But it has
not been a major concern among English-speaking philosophers since the
analytic movement got under way a little over a century ago.</p>

<p>
Helping people to hold true beliefs is a very worthwhile endeavor and
so is helping them transform themselves to lead meaningful lives. The
translator/interpreter must be aware of which approach is reflected in
the text under examination. If we believe the author(s) were concerned
with the way things are in the world, we will employ interpretive
methods to ascertain the truth of the claims made, namely, those
methods concerned with propositional truth: logical and linguistic
analysis, especially in the Anglophone tradition, and/or hermeneutics
or phenomenology among continental philosophers.</p>

<p>
If we understand the ancient Chinese philosophers as having another
basic aim, however, we might pause at using Western interpretive
strategies adopted for propositional truth-seeking to study the
praxis-guiding normative statements of the Chinese. In praxis-guiding
discourse(s) human flourishing for oneself and others was the basic
concern. Put another way, the standard style of Western philosophical
writings tends to be explanatory and justificatory, whereas the
Chinese style tends to be narrative (of experience) and normative.
There are exceptions in both cases of course; normativity is no more
unknown in the West than explanations are in China. But in general
truth is associated with facts and propositions in modern Western
philosophical texts, and with values and the conduct of one&rsquo;s
life in China&rsquo;s classical texts. If so, it is by no means clear
that the methodologies developed for philosophical critiques and
exegeses in the modern Western tradition are suitable for application
<em>mutatis mutandis</em> to Chinese classical writings; attempting to
uncover and explicate one kind of truth may well hinder acquiring
insights about the other.</p>

<h3 id="TraSouSil">4.3 Translating the Sounds of Silence</h3>

<p>
These two different senses of &ldquo;truth&rdquo; bespeak two
different orientations toward philosophy and its purposes; we might
loosely refer to them as truth-seeking and way-making. The
truth-seeking approach is familiar to us, being at the heart of the
Western intellectual tradition, in science no less than philosophy.
And philosophical analysis, hermeneutics and phenomenology are all
tried and true methods for teasing the (propositional) truth from
texts. The model for writing in this philosophical tradition is
clarity and precision of expression (at least in the analytic
school).</p>

<p>
It is not at all clear, however, that those methods are equally
appropriate for working with Chinese texts much of the time. There are
two reasons for this, the first of which is the Chinese model of
writing. Hark back to the discussion of classical Chinese earlier
(&sect;1&ndash;1.4) while reading the following two quotes. First,
from some computer scientists working on natural language
processing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Classical Chinese poetry &hellip; is particularly concise, finely
rich, highly rhetorical and thus linguistically complex, requiring a
high degree of creativity in writing it, sophisticated interpretation
in reading it, and difficulty in understanding it. (Fang et al.
2009)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The comment is specifically about poetry but the point is fairly
general, especially for the canonical texts of the early period. For
the next quote, readers should keep in mind the Western philosophical
model of writing, with clarity and precision the most valued narrative
qualities:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Polysemy eminently suits the serious classical turn. For where words
have more than one meaning, their appearance is apt to induce an
initial state of confusion. This confusion proves useful if it makes
readers aware that it is context and context alone that determines the
values and valences that words assume in any piece of writing, binding
author to reader in the construction and reconstruction of meaning
(Nylan 2011: 66).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If analytic and hermeneutic methods do not get us to the
&ldquo;truths&rdquo; found in the classical texts, what other methods
might be employed? Leigh Jenco (2007) has argued that while the
non-Western orientation in comparative philosophy is clear from the
texts studied, the possibilities for using non-western
<em>methodologies</em> for philosophical inquiry into those texts are
not, and hence the adequacy of Eurocentric approaches to the
discipline can be maintained, as well as the &ldquo;not really
philosophy&rdquo; charge frequently levelled against Chinese texts
because they do not contain arguments, are ambiguous, have little
empirical or logical content, etc. Put another way, while Chinese
texts can become objects of study for the ideas contained in them,
their methods of scholarly inquiry never enter the picture, continuing
thereby to legitimate a Eurocentric approach to scholarly
methodologies.</p>

<p>
Leah Kalmanson (2017) picks up on Jenco&rsquo;s themes, describing
Chinese methods for gaining insights from Chinese texts such as ritual
preparation before reading them, meditation, memorization and
recitation. At first blush it might seem bizarre to suggest that the
performance of rituals, memorization and recitation should be called
&ldquo;methods&rdquo; for interrogating philosophical texts. But the
bizarreness can lessen if we can get away from propositional truth,
knowing-that, and expository models of clarity and precision. The
bizarreness lessens some more if we acknowledge that many Chinese
texts are meant to introduce us to or prompt us to search after
&ldquo;transformative experiences&rdquo; (Paul 2014) that radically change the
experiencer in epistemic and personal ways that cannot possibly be
known before having these experiences. Meditation, ritual preparation,
and recitation of texts (which itself may be an exercise in
meditation) may themselves be such experiences, and it is a point of
convergence between Chinese and Western thought that no matter how
much clarity and precision is achieved in philosophical writing, much
of what is most valuable to which that writing seeks to point also
remains elusive and may at first only be experienced and then wholly
or inadequately articulated.</p>

<p>
The classical Chinese texts are composites more or less, are neither
clear nor precise, are extremely terse, appeal to the eye and the ear
equally, and are replete with ambiguities. Yet the Chinese have long
held that those texts, composed and/or edited by the sages, contain
all the truths needed to lead an exemplary life, a belief firmly held
by many for over 2000 years&mdash;and still held by more than a few
today. Is it possible that we may gain more insight into the
&ldquo;truths&rdquo; of the <em>Daodejing</em> by memorizing and then
reciting it than by subjecting it to logical and linguistic analysis?
The famous scholar-philosopher Zhu Xi of the 13<sup>th</sup> century
suggested how we should read, and his advice is perhaps an appropriate
coda to this entry on issues in translating and interpreting Chinese
philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is layer upon layer [of meaning] in the words of the sages. In
your reading of them, penetrate deeply. If you simply read what is on
the surface you will misunderstand. Steep yourself in the words; only
then will you grasp their meaning. (Gardner 1990: 128)</p>
