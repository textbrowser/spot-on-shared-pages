<h1>George Eliot</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Apr 28, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The work of George Eliot (1819&ndash;1880) challenges any strong
disjunction between philosophy and art. Her deepest philosophical
interests were in ethics, aesthetics, and the relation between them.
Indebted above all to Spinozism and Romanticism, she developed her
thinking in sustained dialogue with the European philosophical
tradition, both before and after she began to write fiction under the
pseudonym &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; in 1857. She wrote novels,
shorter stories, poetry, and review essays, and throughout her career
she experimented with literary form. Through her bestselling novels,
her engagements with philosophy and with contemporary questions about
morality, art, politics, feminism, religion and science reached wide
readerships.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="LifWor">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
George Eliot was born Mary Anne Evans on November 22, 1819. (Despite
several changes of name over the course of her life, she will be
referred to as &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eliot&rdquo;
throughout this entry.) She grew up in modest circumstances in rural
Warwickshire, England. No one in her family received a university
education, but she had access to an extensive library at Arbury Hall,
the estate managed by her father. After learning French at school, she
taught herself German, Latin, Greek, and, later in life, Hebrew. Her
family were conservative Anglicans; in her youth Evans passed through
a devout phase, then went on to question and criticize
Christianity.</p>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s first scholarly work, a translation of D. F.
Strauss&rsquo;s <em>Life of Jesus Critically Examined</em>, was
published in 1846. In translating this controversial work, Eliot was
following in the footsteps of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas
Carlyle, who had produced English translations of important German
works (by Schiller and Goethe respectively) during the first decades
of the nineteenth century. Eliot was thus positioning herself as a
modern woman of letters, within this broadly Romantic and Germanic
intellectual movements (Ashton 1980; Newton 1981; Carlisle 2025).</p>

<p>
In 1850 Eliot moved to London, adopted the name Marian Evans, and
became <em>de facto</em> editor of <em>The Westminster Review</em>, a
high-brow radical journal founded in 1824 by Jeremy Bentham and edited
by John Stuart Mill from 1836 to 1840. Eliot was not the first female
editor of a periodical, but she was the first women to be closely
involved with such a prestigious quarterly journal (Dillane 2011). She
co-edited <em>The Westminster Review</em> with the publisher John
Chapman, who acquired it in 1851. In their &ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo;,
printed in their first issue of January 1852, Chapman and Eliot
highlighted the journal&rsquo;s special interest in &ldquo;Social
Philosophy&rdquo;; its commitment to free speech and
&ldquo;Progress&rdquo;; and its support for gradual reform, including
&ldquo;a progressive extension of the suffrage, in proportion as the
people become fitted for using it&rdquo;. On religious questions, the
editors declared their &ldquo;uncompromising pursuit of truth&rdquo;
and their &ldquo;conviction that religion has its foundation in
man&rsquo;s nature&rdquo;, while recognizing religion to be closely
connected to &ldquo;moral&rdquo;, &ldquo;poetic&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;emotional&rdquo; development (Chapman &amp; Eliot 1852). This
progressive editorial agenda somewhat softened the radical politics
and secularism of the <em>Westminster Review</em> under Bentham and
Mill. A more significant difference was its greater emphasis on new
and recent literary works (Gray 2000; Dillane 2011). The issues
co-edited by Eliot and Chapman carried substantial articles on
contemporary literature in England, America, Germany, and France,
propagating the very concept of a national literature. Eliot also
oversaw innovations in the journal&rsquo;s design and layout,
including the addition of a substantial index.</p>

<p>
As editor at the <em>Westminster Review</em>, Eliot entered a network
of influential intellectuals including J. S. Mill, Herbert Spencer,
Harriet Martineau, James Froude, and George Henry Lewes. Lewes became
her long-term partner and collaborator. In the late 1850s she took on
the name &ldquo;Marian Lewes&rdquo;, though Lewes remained legally
married to his estranged wife Agnes Lewes. Their relationship was
widely regarded as scandalous, and ruined Eliot&rsquo;s reputation.
For years she was socially ostracized. While this changed when she
became a celebrated author, the reputational damage from her
partnership with Lewes continued to affect her life, work, and public
image.</p>

<p>
During the 1850s Eliot produced the first English translations of
Ludwig Feuerbach&rsquo;s <em>On the Essence of Christianity</em>
(1854) and Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> (1856, but unpublished in
her lifetime). Feuerbach, like Strauss, was a liberal German
Protestant influenced by the German Idealists, especially Hegel; a
reviewer of Eliot&rsquo;s translation of <em>The Essence of
Christianity</em> criticized the way it &ldquo;exhibit[ed] the new
Hegelian Atheism to English readers&rdquo; (Anonymous 1854: 559).
Eliot admired Feuerbach&rsquo;s ideas, and planned to publish an
original essay titled &ldquo;On the Idea of a Future Life&rdquo;,
advertised in the <em>Westminster Review</em> as forthcoming by the
translator of Feuerbach. This lost essay may have resembled <em>The
Essence of Christianity</em> in being a philosophical-theological
treatise aimed at a broad cultured readership, and in applying
Feuerbachian insights to the question of human immortality. Framing
her professional identity as the translator of Strauss and Feuerbach
suggests a plan to contribute in her own voice to the religious and
philosophical debates carried out by these German thinkers.</p>

<p>
In translating Spinoza, Eliot was going back to the most significant
source of her intellectual milieu. Spinoza&rsquo;s non-dualist
metaphysics was a foundation for German Romanticism and Idealism
alike, and thus formative for Strauss and Feuerbach. Although
Eliot&rsquo;s translation of the <em>Ethics</em> remained unpublished
and therefore did not have the cultural impact it deserved, its effect
on her own intellectual formation was both immediate and enduring. Its
influence is evident on her <em>Westminster Review</em> essays on the
popular Calvinist preacher John Cumming (Carlisle 2020a: 22&ndash;26)
and on Wilhelm Riehl&rsquo;s <em>The Natural History of German
Life</em> (Carlisle 2020b: 601&ndash;4). These substantial,
authoritative, wide-ranging essays, marking the culmination of
Eliot&rsquo;s journalistic career, were both written during her
immersion in Spinoza. Scholars have traced through the novels of
George Eliot Spinozist ideas about freedom and determinism, emotion,
human flourishing, and the work of imagination (Atkins 1978; Lynn
1996, Armstrong 2013; Gatens 2003, 2007, 2023; Frazer 2018; Anger 2001
[2019]). Towards the end of her career, Eliot would examine questions
about literary labour&mdash;scholarship, originality, appropriation,
productivity, cultural transmission&mdash;and about the nature of
Englishness that first arose during her generative period as a
translator (Raterman 2013; Carlisle 2025).</p>

<p>
The pseudonym &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; was first adopted in 1857, a
few weeks after Eliot published her first work of fiction in
<em>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine.</em> This debut was the first of three
magazine stories, subsequently published together as <em>Scenes of
Clerical Life</em> (1858). Eliot wrote seven novels: <em>Adam
Bede</em> (1859), <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> (1860), <em>Silas
Marner</em> (1861), <em>Romola</em> (1863), <em>Felix Holt: The
Radical</em> (1866), <em>Middlemarch</em> (1871&ndash;2), and
<em>Daniel Deronda</em> (1876). Her last published work was a
semi-fictional, satirical and intensely ironic essay collection titled
<em>Impressions of Theophrastus Such</em> (1879), after the
Peripatetic philosopher Theophrastus. Eliot&rsquo;s other works
include the novellas <em>The Lifted Veil</em> (1859) and <em>Brother
Jacob</em> (1864); the verse dramas <em>The Spanish Gypsy</em> (1868)
and <em>Armgart</em> (1870); <em>The Legend of Jubal and Other
Poems</em> (1874); and numerous critical essays that were published,
mostly anonymously, throughout the 1840s, 50s and 60s.</p>

<p>
During the 1850s and 60s Eliot and Lewes travelled quite frequently to
the European continent, especially the major cities of Germany and
Italy. The couple did not have children, though Eliot was stepmother
to Lewes&rsquo;s three sons. Lewes died in 1878, and in the spring of
1880 Eliot married her old friend John Cross, a wealthy banker. She
died in London on December 22, 1880. She was buried under the names
&ldquo;Mary Ann Cross&rdquo; and &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; in North
London&rsquo;s Highgate Cemetery, next to Lewes&rsquo;s grave. Her
wish to be buried in Poet&rsquo;s Corner in Westminster Abbey was
denied by church leaders due to her &ldquo;notorious antagonism to
Christian practice in regard to marriage&rdquo; (Carlisle 2023:
267&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
While Eliot usually described herself as an artist, many
contemporaries regarded her as a philosopher. A few months after her
death, an early volume of <em>MIND</em> carried a substantial article
on &ldquo;George Eliot&rsquo;s Art&rdquo; (Sully 1881). During the
twentieth century, her exploratory intellectual style, coupled with
her decision to work in the medium of fiction, tended to occlude her
significance for an increasingly professionalized and technical
discipline of philosophy. Twenty-first-century scholars have been more
keen to recognize Eliot&rsquo;s contributions to philosophy,
especially in view of the fact that Victorian women had to
philosophize outside the academy. While British universities did not
begin to admit women until the 1860s and restricted their access to
higher qualifications and academic careers well into the twentieth
century, philosophical thinking can be found in a wide variety of
women&rsquo;s writing, including letters, poems, novels, travel
writing, memoir, and journalism (Stone 2023).</p>

<h2 id="PhiMet">2. Philosophical Method</h2>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s literary practice was integral to her philosophical
method. Her style of thinking is often exploratory and dialectical,
reflexive and self-problematizing. When doctrinal statements are made
by a character or a narrator, we cannot assume they articulate
Eliot&rsquo;s own position. For these reasons, her philosophical
claims can be difficult to pin down. Moreover, she argued against the
application of &ldquo;general doctrine[s]&rdquo; (M III: 133) and
&ldquo;general rules&rdquo; (MF III: 265) to the complexities of human
life. Eliot aimed less to solve problems, or offer ready-made
doctrines, than to undertake an open-ended enquiry alongside her
readers. In 1875, while writing <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, she stated
that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider myself a teacher, but a companion
in the struggle for thought&rdquo; (Eliot to Mary Ponsonby, 11
February 1875; LGHL 3: 83).</p>

<p>
Language was Eliot&rsquo;s medium for this intellectual
&ldquo;struggle&rdquo;, and one highly distinctive feature of her
thought is the depth and breadth of her linguistic expertise. She was
not only an immensely skilled literary writer, but a scholar of
languages and a translator. Linguistic precision had enduring
importance for Eliot: in an 1865 book review she laments</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a fatiguing use of vague or shifting phrases, such as &ldquo;modern
civilization&rdquo;, &ldquo;spirit of the
age&rdquo;,&hellip;&ldquo;habits of religious thought&rdquo;,
unbalanced by any precise definition. (Eliot 1865: 54)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet precision, she observes, is always endangered by the subtleties,
ambiguities and multivalences inherent in all natural languages. While
some of her contemporaries&mdash;rather like modern analytic
philosophers&mdash;sought to rectify this by constructing &ldquo;a
universal language on a rational basis&hellip;which effects the
purpose of communication as perfectly and rapidly as algebraic
signs&rdquo;, Eliot argues that such a language &ldquo;will never
express <em>life</em>, which is a great deal more than science&rdquo;
(Eliot 1856b: 69). Furthermore, a purely logical language would lack
all &ldquo;power over the imagination&rdquo; (Eliot 1856b: 69).
Achieving truthfulness in writing therefore requires a literary skill
close to &ldquo;genius&rdquo; to employ natural language with
sufficient &ldquo;definiteness and certainty&rdquo; (Eliot 1856b:
69).</p>

<p>
Eliot created remarkably sophisticated literary works, and their full
philosophical value cannot be appreciated separately from their
aesthetic features. An excessive focus on the explicit philosophical
pronouncements made by Eliot&rsquo;s narrators, by her characters, or
by Eliot herself, could give rise to the worry that assertions are
being made without argument. Considered more holistically, her texts
challenge the narrow definition of argument that underpins this
concern.</p>

<h2 id="HumConKeyCon">3. The Human Condition: Key Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="Cha">3.1 Character</h3>

<p>
As a creator of characters, Eliot confronted questions about the
nature and significance of character throughout her literary career.
In this way she contributed to wider philosophical debates: in 1843
John Stuart Mill proposed an &ldquo;Exact Science of Human
Nature&rdquo; which would be a &ldquo;science of
character&hellip;including the formation of national or collective
character as well as individual&rdquo; (Mill 1843: bk. VI, ch. V,
&sect;4 [1889: 567]). Mill named this new science
&ldquo;Ethology&rdquo;, thus placing it within an Aristotelian
tradition of moral philosophy focused on the cluster of
concepts&mdash;character, custom, habit, and way of
life&mdash;signalled by the Greek word <em>ethos</em>. Eliot invokes
this tradition explicitly by naming the narrator of her final work
after Theophrastus, pupil of Aristotle and author of <em>The
Characters</em> (Henry 1994; Brilmyer 2014). The working title of
<em>Impressions of Theophrastus Such</em> was &ldquo;Characters and
Characteristics of Theophrastus Such&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The concept of character was Eliot&rsquo;s route into metaphysical
questions of freedom and determinism (G. Levine 1962; Brilmyer 2015).
At stake in nineteenth-century debates about character was a dispute
between biological determinists and defenders of a liberal doctrine of
collective and individual moral improvement. Though influenced by the
strict determinism she encountered while translating Spinoza&rsquo;s
<em>Ethics</em>, Eliot refuses the polarities of this debate and
probes its complexities. Her art emphasizes social over biological
constraints, and inter-dependence over both determinism and free will.
Its explorations of habit and custom&mdash;laws that, to borrow
Leibniz&rsquo;s opportune phrase, &ldquo;incline without
necessitating&rdquo; (Look 2008 [2022: &sect; 4])&mdash;open up a
middle path through these alternatives. In &ldquo;The Natural History
of German Life&rdquo;, an 1856 review of two works by the German
sociologist Wilhelm Riehl, Eliot notes &ldquo;the generic character of
the German peasant&rdquo; for whom &ldquo;custom&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;supreme law&rdquo; (Eliot 1856b: 68; Dillane 2009).</p>

<p>
<em>Silas Marner</em> begins with a dismal vision of the mechanization
of human character in an industrial age. Silas, a weaver, has
degenerated into a biological-mechanical hybrid, &ldquo;shrunk&rdquo;
and &ldquo;bent&rdquo; into &ldquo;a constant mechanical relation to
the objects of his life&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The livelong day he sat in his loom, his ear filled with its monotony,
his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of sameness in the
brownish web, his muscles moving with such even repetition that their
pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the holding of his breath.
(SM 29&ndash;31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Over the course of the novel, Silas is re-humanized by the love of an
adopted daughter and new friendships with his neighbours. However,
this story&rsquo;s fable-like literary form strikes a warning that its
hero&rsquo;s happy ending is due to quasi-miraculous good fortune, not
a freely-willed programme of self-improvement.</p>

<p>
In <em>Middlemarch</em>, Eliot&rsquo;s narrator observes that
character is &ldquo;a process and an unfolding&rdquo; (M I: 226). The
novel&rsquo;s plot and literary form emphasize the dependence of this
character &ldquo;process&rdquo; on social more than biological
conditions. Its narrator inclines towards social determinism by
claiming that &ldquo;There is no creature whose inward being is so
strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside
it&rdquo; (M III: 464; cf. Spinoza, <em>Ethics</em> IVp18s: &ldquo;we
can never bring ourselves to a state in which we should want nothing
external in order to preserve our existence&rdquo;). In keeping with
its title, however, <em>Middlemarch</em> steers a middle course
between determinism and free will, while drawing on biological
metaphors (Brilmyer 2015). In one scene, Reverend Farebrother advises
the novel&rsquo;s heroine, Dorothea Brooke, that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
character is not cut in marble&mdash;it is not something solid and
unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become
diseased as our bodies do;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;then it may be rescued and healed&rdquo;, replies Dorothea (M
III: 310). Yet any moral healing accomplished over the course of the
novel is, at best, partial.</p>

<h3 id="Mil">3.2 The Milieu</h3>

<p>
Like character, the milieu is a crucial concept in Eliot&rsquo;s art.
In the early decades of the nineteenth century this concept emerged,
within the new science of biology, to draw attention to the relations
between an organism and its surrounding conditions of existence.
Lamarck&rsquo;s <em lang="fr">les circonstances</em> and Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire&rsquo;s <em lang="fr">le milieu ambiant</em> preceded
Auguste Comte&rsquo;s use of <em lang="fr">le milieu</em> in 1838,
evoking &ldquo;a certain intuition of a centred formation&rdquo;
(Canguilhem 2001: 11). Another new science, &ldquo;sociology&rdquo;,
stretched the concept to encompass cultural as well as natural
conditions of life. In the early 1850s, Eliot urged Herbert Spencer to
read Comte&rsquo;s <em lang="fr">Cours de philosophie positive</em>;
Spencer then developed Comte&rsquo;s concept of milieu, proposing
&ldquo;environment&rdquo; as a single term naming biological and
social circumstances. His thesis that organisms are constantly
adjusting to their environment anticipated the theory of adaptation
presented in Darwin&rsquo;s <em>Origin of Species</em>.</p>

<p>
For Eliot&mdash;unlike Spencer&mdash;science provides a model or
analogy rather than a method for the investigation of human life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In natural science, I have understood, there is nothing petty to the
mind that has a large vision of relations, and to which every single
object suggests a vast sum of conditions. It is surely the same with
the observation of human life,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
declares the urbane narrator of <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> (MF II:
151). Eliot sees human lives as &ldquo;interwoven&rdquo;, and
construes the novelist&rsquo;s task as &ldquo;unravelling&rdquo; a
complex web of relations to reveal the interconnectedness of all
things (M I: 214). At the same time, her artistic process entailed
creating intricate literary webs; of her last novel, <em>Daniel
Deronda</em>, she wrote that &ldquo;I meant everything in the book to
be related to everything else there&rdquo; (Eliot to Barbara Bodichon,
2 October 1876; <em>Letters</em> 6: 290).</p>

<p>
In his 1881 <em>MIND</em> article on &ldquo;George Eliot&rsquo;s
Art&rdquo;, James Sully highlights Eliot&rsquo;s deployment of the
concept of milieu:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A character divorced from its surroundings is an abstraction. A
personality is only a concrete living whole when we attach it by a
network of organic filaments to its particular environment, physical
and social&hellip; [Eliot] looks on these [surroundings] as having a
living continuity with the people whom she sets among them. Their
artistic value is but a reflection of all that they mean to those for
whom they have made the nearer and habitually enclosing world. (Sully
1881: 382&ndash;3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Both the natural milieu and the social milieu are important
subject-matter in Eliot&rsquo;s art. Her attitude towards the social
&ldquo;world&rdquo; or &ldquo;medium&rdquo; (as she sometimes
translates <em>milieu</em>) is profoundly ambivalent. A tight-knit
provincial milieu provides a nexus of meaning and belonging&mdash;in
short, a home; it can also be overwhelming and constrictive.
Ambitious, idealistic Dr Lydgate, for example, finds that &ldquo;the
petty medium of Middlemarch had been too strong for him&rdquo; (M I:
285). Yet a more cosmopolitan milieu risks dislocating human lives
from their habitat. &ldquo;A human life, I think, should be well
rooted in some spot of a native land&rdquo;, opines the narrator of
<em>Daniel Deronda</em>, and several characters in this novel&rsquo;s
modern setting suffer from the lack of &ldquo;this blessed persistence
in which affection can take root&rdquo; (DD I: 26&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
In 1868, while working on <em>Middlemarch</em>, Eliot condensed her
thoughts on the milieu in a short unpublished essay titled
&ldquo;Notes on Form in Art&rdquo;. Here she defines form as &ldquo;a
limit determined partly by the intrinsic relations or composition of
the object, and partly by the extrinsic action of other bodies upon
it&rdquo; (Eliot 1868 [1963: 434]). The formation of an artwork
mirrors the formation of character insofar as it unfolds within an
aesthetic and ethical milieu: &ldquo;in adjustment with certain given
conditions of sound, language, action, or environment&rdquo;.
Emphasizing relationality and interdependence, she elucidates a
Spinozist</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
conception of wholes composed of parts more and more multiplied and
highly differenced, yet more and more absolutely bound together by
various conditions of common likeness or mutual dependence. (Eliot
1868 [1963: 433])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Following Spinoza, she suggests that complexity corresponds to power;
again, she seems to apply this principle to artworks as much as to
organic wholes. When Eliot writes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the highest Form, then, is the highest organism, [i.e.] the most
varied group of relations bound together in a wholeness which again
has the most varied relations with all other phenomena. (Eliot 1868
[1963: 433])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
she articulates the ideal of literary form that guides her mature
fiction. Eliot&rsquo;s novels, above all <em>Middlemarch</em> and
<em>Daniel Deronda</em>, depict the intricate connectedness of
ecological, biological, social, political and psychological forces,
often by constructing analogical relations between multiple characters
and events (Mansell 1965a; Carlisle 2020b).</p>

<h3 id="SelCen">3.3 Self-Centredness</h3>

<p>
Selfishness is the most basic moral problem confronted in
Eliot&rsquo;s work. It is closely connected with her concept of the
milieu, according to which every organism is, by definition, in the
middle of its environment. On a psychological level, when human beings
locate themselves at the centre of a world, their self-centring
involves a failure to attend to others&rsquo; subjectivity. This
failure is epistemic as well as moral; <em>Middlemarch</em>&rsquo;s
narrator declares that &ldquo;We are all of us born in moral
stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme
selves&rdquo; (M I: 323). Eliot illustrates this claim by describing
how Dorothea, a young wife, struggles to &ldquo;conceive with that
distinctness which is no longer reflection but feeling&rdquo; that her
husband has &ldquo;an equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and
shadows must always fall with a certain difference&rdquo; (M I:
323).</p>

<p>
In another key passage, the image of &ldquo;concentric circles&rdquo;
around a &ldquo;centre&rdquo; evokes Eliot&rsquo;s concept of milieu,
while functioning more explicitly as a symbol of human egoism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
An eminent philosopher among my friends&hellip;has shown me this
pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or extensive surface of polished
steel made to be rubbed by a house maid, will be minutely and
multitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it
a lighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches
will seem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles
round that little sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going
everywhere impartially, and it is only your candle which produces the
flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling
with an exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable. The
scratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now
absent &mdash; of Miss Vincy, for example. (M I: 403; Albrecht 2020:
59&ndash;88)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s moral critique of egoism always involves self-critique.
Interestingly, she saw this ordinary human egoism mirrored in her
artistic work: &ldquo;But what is fiction other than an arrangement of
events or feigned correspondences according to predominant feeling?
&hellip;we make what pleases us&rdquo; (Eliot 1868 [1963: 434];
Albrecht 2020: 68&ndash;75).</p>

<h3 id="TriSig">3.4 Triviality and significance</h3>

<p>
A persistent theme in Eliot&rsquo;s work is the contrast, within human
life, between significance and insignificance&mdash;and the unsettling
of this distinction. Consider the rather conventional insight
expressed here in a letter to a friend, written when Eliot was in her
mid thirties:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we are young we think our troubles a mighty business&mdash;that
the world is spread out expressly as a stage for the particular drama
of our lives&hellip; I have done enough of that in my time. But we
begin at last to understand that these things are important only to
one&rsquo;s own consciousness, which is but a globule of dew on a
rose-leaf that at mid-day there will be no trace of. (Eliot to Cara
Bray, 19 May 1854; <em>Letters</em> 2: 156)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s novels frequently dramatize the inflated self-importance
described in the first part of this quotation. However, they also
subvert conventional judgements about relative importance and
triviality.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;great man&rdquo; theory of history, prominent among
Eliot&rsquo;s contemporaries, epitomizes those conventional
judgements. Notable examples (all of whom Eliot read closely) are
Thomas Carlyle&rsquo;s <em>On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in
History</em> (1841); Auguste Comte&rsquo;s positivist calendar (1849),
with its thirteen lunar months named after eminent men such as
Aristotle and Descartes; and Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s
<em>Representative Men</em> (1850). By contrast, Eliot placed obscure,
mediocre lives at the centre of her fictional worlds.
<em>Middlemarch</em> in particular directly challenges the
&ldquo;great man&rdquo; paradigm by invoking a feminine exemplar,
Saint Theresa, and by refracting her exemplarity through Dorothea
Brooke&rsquo;s &ldquo;unhistoric&rdquo; life (M III: 465).</p>

<p>
Eliot achieves these effects through narrative irony. Early in
<em>Middlemarch</em>, the reader is encouraged to laugh at
Dorothea&rsquo;s grandiose aspirations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with
us would mean the greatest things. It would be like marrying
Pascal&hellip; I should see how it was possible to live a grand life
here&mdash;now&mdash;in England,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
thinks Dorothea, as she contemplates marriage to Edward Casaubon, a
petty-minded amateur scholar (M I: 40). Yet Eliot attributes an unseen
moral grandeur to Dorothea&rsquo;s struggles to live a good life, and
(ironically) discloses this to the reader.</p>

<p>
Eliot is not only concerned with rethinking the question of
<em>who</em> might count as significant, and morally exemplary. She is
also occupied by the tension between the intense significance we
accord to our own lives and the lives of those close to us, and their
comic insignificance <em lang="la">sub specie aeternitatis.</em> This
theme is prominent in <em>Middlemarch</em> and is further intensified
in <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, which features a quintessentially trivial
heroine, Gwendolen Harleth, who is preoccupied with her &ldquo;small
inferences of the way in which she could make her life pleasant&rdquo;
(DD I: 181). Gwendolen cuts a tiny figure in a novel set on the grand
stage of world history, and at the enlarged scales of modern astronomy
and ancient cosmology.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What in the midst of that mighty drama are girls and their blind
visions? Could there be a slenderer, more insignificant thread in
human history than this consciousness of a girl&hellip;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
asks the narrator (DD I: 181). This proves to be an ironic question,
as Eliot uses Gwendolen&rsquo;s marriage plot to stage a cosmic
struggle between good and evil, drawing on the Kabbalistic myth of a
human soul&rsquo;s arduous journey to its divine source (Baker 1973;
Carlisle 2023: 217&ndash;19, 340&ndash;42).</p>

<h3 id="ThoFee">3.5 Thought and feeling</h3>

<p>
The words &ldquo;thought&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;,
&ldquo;think and feel&rdquo;, frequently appear conjoined in
Eliot&rsquo;s writing. Her novels treat the integration of thought and
feeling as an intellectual-affective ideal constitutive of human
flourishing (which she tends to construe in terms of psychic and moral
growth).</p>

<p>
This element of Eliot&rsquo;s thought is influenced by her close study
of both Spinoza and Comte during the 1850s (Gatens 2019).
Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> devotes one of its five parts to an
analysis of human emotions that treats them as universal and fully
intelligible, comparable to the objects of geometry (<em>Ethics</em>
III, Preface). Spinoza argues that both the imagination and the
affects can be trained, though not eliminated, by the power of
understanding. He regards the highest kind of knowing as intuitive,
and distinguished by the immediacy of feeling:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we feel [<em lang="la">sentimus</em>], we experience, that we are
eternal. For the mind no less feels [<em lang="la">sentit</em>] those
things which it conceives by the understanding, than those which it
has in the memory. (<em>Ethics</em> Vp23s)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Eliot&rsquo;s interpretation of the <em>Ethics</em>, such
intellectual feeling is continuous with emotional feeling: she
consistently introduces the verb &ldquo;to feel&rdquo; into her
translations of Spinoza&rsquo;s discussions of the emotions. In his
late work <em>The System of Positive Polity</em> (1855) Comte
postulates a &ldquo;unity&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; of human
being comprising &ldquo;a complete convergence both of the Feelings
and of the Thoughts&rdquo;; &ldquo;the continuous union of the two
principal elements, affective and speculative&rdquo; (Comte 1875:
16&ndash;17). For Comte, these elements are gendered female and male
respectively, and their balance within society turns out to require
women to devote themselves to domesticity and &ldquo;surrender all
claim to temporal authority&rdquo;, even within the home (Comte 1875:
302). In 1875, when the English translation of <em>The System of
Positive Polity</em> was published, Eliot took detailed notes on
Comte&rsquo;s account of the relationship between emotion and
knowledge (Wright 1986: 173&ndash;201; Anger 2001 [2019: 223]).</p>

<p>
Eliot suggests that knowledge pertaining to human life, particularly
in its experiential and moral dimensions, is deficient if it lacks
feeling. She went so far as to claim that her friend Herbert
Spencer&rsquo;s philosophical work&mdash;&ldquo;his theorising, &amp;
his mode of pursuing arguments&rdquo;&mdash;was &ldquo;injuriously
affected&rdquo; by his &ldquo;inadequate endowment of emotion&rdquo;
(Eliot to Mary Ponsonby, 11 February 1875; LGHL 3: 83). By contrast,
the artist (see
 <a href="#Art">&sect;4.3</a>)
 can be a conduit or medium between thought and feeling. In
<em>Middlemarch</em>, Will Ladislaw defines &ldquo;the poet&rdquo; as
someone possessing &ldquo;a soul in which knowledge passes
instantaneously into feeling, and feeling flashes back as a new organ
of knowledge&rdquo; (M I: 341&ndash;2).</p>

<p>
Since feeling is essentially first-personal, its importance for Eliot
is a cause for scepticism about knowledge of other human minds, which
differ in their character as well as in their experiential contents.
Eliot regards this as a practical difficulty that is not easily
solved. Theoretically, her solution is the concept of sympathy (see
 <a href="#Sym">&sect;5.2</a>),
 literally &ldquo;feeling-with&rdquo;. Sympathy extends affective
knowing from the first-person singular to the first-person plural. In
one of <em>Middlemarch</em>&rsquo;s closing scenes, the heroine
Dorothea tells her sister Celia that &ldquo;You would have to feel
with me, else you would never know&rdquo; (M III: 442). This
proposition can be read in a doubled semantic context:
Dorothea&rsquo;s communication with her sister on a particular
question (how she got together with Will Ladislaw); and Eliot&rsquo;s
communication with her reader on a much broader philosophical question
about the possibility of an adequate interpersonal knowledge that can
underpin ethics.</p>

<h2 id="PhiArt">4. Philosophy of Art</h2>

<p>
Eliot developed her philosophy of art first as a critic and then as a
practitioner. She construed her turn to fiction writing in the 1850s
as the discovery of her artistic vocation, and consistently described
herself as an artist. Taking a self-problematizing view of the moral
purposes of literature, Eliot reflected critically on the ethics of
sympathy dramatized in her fiction and exemplified in her narrative
voice.</p>

<h3 id="Rea">4.1 Realism</h3>

<p>
Eliot diagnosed and criticized other-worldliness in art, as in
religion: an aversion to life as it is (Eliot 1857). But what does it
mean for art to be true to life? Eliot&rsquo;s answer to this question
draws on John Ruskin&rsquo;s analysis of visual art to defend
&ldquo;realism&rdquo;, defined as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the doctrine that all truth and beauty are to be attained by a humble
and faithful study of nature, and not by substituting vague forms,
bred by imagination on the mists of feeling, in place of definite,
substantial reality. (Eliot 1856a: 626; Henry &amp; Levine 2019)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This realism is qualified in two important respects. First, while
Eliot here uses &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;
pejoratively, she elsewhere uses these terms much more positively and
does not usually oppose them to reality or truth. Explaining her own
artistic purpose in 1859, she wrote that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If Art does not enlarge men&rsquo;s sympathies, it does nothing
morally&hellip; the only effect I ardently long to produce by my
writings, is that those who read them should be better able to
<em>imagine</em> and to <em>feel</em> the pains and the joys of those
who differ from themselves in everything but the broad fact of being
struggling erring human creatures. (<em>Letters</em> 3: 111; emphasis
in original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Second, realism for Eliot (as for Ruskin) always entails
interpretation. She regards art as &ldquo;inevitably subjective&rdquo;
even when it attempts to be &ldquo;purely imitative&rdquo;: &ldquo;the
most active perception gives us rather a reflex of what we think and
feel, than the real sum of the objects before us&rdquo; (Eliot 1855a:
703). She suggests, via the narrator of <em>Adam Bede</em>, that in
order to &ldquo;avoid any&hellip;arbitrary picture&rdquo; of life, the
artist should give a &ldquo;faithful&hellip;account of men and things
as they have mirrored themselves in [his] mind&rdquo; (AB I: 265;
Mansell 1965b).</p>

<p>
So Eliot holds that truth in art is necessarily mediated by the
artist&rsquo;s subjectivity. She characterizes that subjectivity by
the self-complicating metaphor of a mirror that is
&ldquo;defective&rdquo;, possibly distorting. On this view, the artist
may be unable to perceive accurately things as they are, yet must
strive for honesty about what they <em>do</em> see. Thus Eliot casts
doubt on epistemic truth while urging moral truthfulness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the mirror is doubtless defective; the outlines will sometimes be
disturbed, the reflection faint or confused; but I feel as much bound
to tell you as precisely as I can what that reflection is, as if I
were in the witness-box narrating my experience on oath. (AB I:
265&ndash;6; Albrecht 2020: 30&ndash;58)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The courtroom simile here accentuates realism&rsquo;s moral
seriousness. This passage also indicates that realism&rsquo;s
commitment to truthfulness entails careful attention to linguistic
precision (see
 <a href="#PhiMet">&sect;2</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="PurArt">4.2 The purposes of art</h3>

<p>
Eliot wrote in hope of literary communion with her readers. She
construes this communion as both affective and intellectual.
&ldquo;What one&rsquo;s soul thirsts for&rdquo;, she wrote in
1873,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is&hellip;that what one meant has been perfectly seized, that the
emotion which stirred one in writing is repeated in the mind of the
reader. (<em>Letters</em> 5: 374)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The narrator of her very first story hopes that the reader will
&ldquo;learn with me to see&rdquo; the wide range of affective
experience that normally remains concealed within an ordinary
&ldquo;human soul&rdquo; (SCL 67).</p>

<p>
Her aesthetic realism has a clear moral purpose. It means endeavouring
to depict human beings not as they ought to be, but as they are, since
real human beings are the objects of our moral concern. In &ldquo;The
Natural History of German Life&rdquo;, her programmatic 1856 review
essay, Eliot asserts that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A picture of human life such that a great artist can give, surprises
even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart
from themselves, which may be called the raw material of moral
sentiment. [Art] is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our
contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.
(Eliot 1856b: 54; see also <em>Letters</em> 3: 111; 4: 472)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This commitment is sharply inflected by class consciousness: Eliot
seeks to rectify how working-class people, such as labourers and
shopkeepers, are customarily judged by readers implicitly assumed to
belong to a higher social class. She argues that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the thing for mankind to know is, not what are the motives and
influences which the moralist thinks <em>ought</em> to act on the
laborer or the artisan, but what are the motives and influences which
<em>do</em> act on him. We want to be taught to feel, not for the
heroic artisan or the sentimental peasant, but for the peasant in all
his coarse apathy, and the artisan in all his suspicious selfishness.
(Eliot 1856b: 54&ndash;5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot claims that artists offer new knowledge, insofar as art extends
the range of our perceptions&mdash;not least by channelling attention
to phenomena that have been veiled by habit, or by self-centred
preoccupations. In &ldquo;The Natural History of German Life&rdquo;,
this aesthetic cognitivism is underpinned by an account of
imaginative, associative thinking drawn from Part 2 of Spinoza&rsquo;s
<em>Ethics</em> (<em>Ethics</em> IIp18). Eliot observes how a certain
word (her example is &ldquo;railways&rdquo;) evokes in the mind of an
ordinary person a limited &ldquo;range of images&rdquo; representing
that person&rsquo;s particular experiential history, whereas in the
mind of an expert the same word will evoke a much fuller knowledge,
comprising &ldquo;all the essential facts in the existence and
relations of the thing&rdquo; (Eliot 1856b: 51&ndash;2). She argues
that such a complete knowledge of the working classes can be gained by
studying &ldquo;their natural history&rdquo;, and can be articulated
by artists as well as by theorists. The distinction between
&ldquo;narrow&rdquo; and &ldquo;wide&rdquo; mental capacities recurs
continually in Eliot&rsquo;s novels, marking a moral as well as a
cognitive divide. The &ldquo;Natural History&rdquo; essay qualifies
this distinction by suggesting that wide views must be matched by wide
&ldquo;observation&rdquo; that yields &ldquo;concrete knowledge&rdquo;
of particulars (Eliot 1856b: 51&ndash;2, 56). Wide views alone are not
just insufficient, but potentially pernicious. They may produce a
character such as <em>Middlemarch</em>&rsquo;s Mr Brooke, whose mental
openness is mere vacuity, just as his tolerance amounts to little more
than neglect of his moral responsibilities, not least for his poor
tenants who live in squalid conditions (Carlisle 2020b).</p>

<p>
Like her realism, Eliot&rsquo;s view of the purpose of art is
self-complicating. Despite the strong cognitivist strand theorized in
her critical writings and pursued in her fiction, Eliot also valued
epistemic humility. She expressed the hope that her own art might
instil this epistemic virtue.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I only wish I could write something that would contribute to heighten
men&rsquo;s reverence before the secrets of each other&rsquo;s souls,
that there might be less assumption of entire knowingness, as a datum
from which inferences are to be drawn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
she wrote to a friend in 1859 (<em>Letters</em> 3: 164).</p>

<h3 id="Art">4.3 The artist</h3>

<p>
The influence of Romanticism meant that the figure of the artist
loomed large for Eliot. Her treatment of this figure exemplifies her
dialectical, self-critical mode of thinking. She depicts the artist as
productively hyper-sensitive, while exploring the pitfalls of this
sensitivity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[E]very great artist is a teacher..., by giving us his higher
sensibility as a medium, a delicate acoustic or optical instrument,
bringing home to our coarser senses what would otherwise be
unperceived,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
she declares in an essay on Goethe (1855d: 289). However,
Eliot&rsquo;s melodramatic story &ldquo;The Lifted Veil&rdquo; (1859)
probes the darker side of this hyper-perceptive artist, parodied by
its clairvoyant and &ldquo;morbidly sensitive&rdquo; (1859 [1878:
297]) protagonist, Latimer, who is depressed, misanthropic, and
destined to a lonely death. This is partly a self-portrait: Eliot
refers to &ldquo;my morbid sensibility&rdquo; in a letter written in
the same year as &ldquo;The Lifted Veil&rdquo; (<em>Letters</em> 3:
164). In <em>Middlemarch</em>, Eliot&rsquo;s narrator appears to
defend a kind of saving ignorance as a counterpoint to the perils of
hypersensitivity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it
would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel&rsquo;s heart
beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of
silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with
stupidity. (M I: 297&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot treats the artist&rsquo;s creative egoism with similar
ambivalence. We have seen (4.1) how Eliot&rsquo;s artist mediates
reality in the mirror of their own subjectivity and experience. This
is depicted as an act of generosity or of narcissism&mdash;or possibly
both at once. When the narrator of <em>Adam Bede</em> expounds his
theory of literary realism, he rejects the idealizing alternative,
which would &ldquo;refashion life and character entirely after my own
liking&rdquo;, thereby creating an &ldquo;arbitrary picture&rdquo; (AB
I: 265). Eliot uses similar phrasing to describe young Maggie
Tulliver, the partially autobiographical heroine of <em>The Mill on
the Floss</em>, &ldquo;refashioning her little world into just what
she should like it to be&rdquo; (MF I: 69). Maggie, an avid reader,
feels that &ldquo;the world outside books was not a happy one&rdquo;
(MF II: 80). Perhaps Eliot&rsquo;s implicit comment here is that
Maggie&rsquo;s imagination is shaped by idealizing, romanticizing
literature of the type she criticizes. Yet the characterization may
also involve a self-critique. Despite her realist commitment to
truthfully depicting averagely flawed human beings, the distinctive
compassionate tone of Eliot&rsquo;s narrative voice nevertheless
refashions the world as she would like it to be. The literary world of
Eliot&rsquo;s fiction is infused with sympathy and acceptance; it is,
in other words, a world as it appears in the eyes of an attentive,
loving mother. James Sully aptly described Eliot&rsquo;s trademark
&ldquo;attitude of a large maternal charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;mood of
compassionate tenderness touched with playful indulgence&rdquo; (Sully
1881: 391). In this respect Eliot&rsquo;s fictive world is markedly
different from the real world that its author herself
experienced&mdash;a world formed both by narrowly moralistic human
judgements, and by the doctrines of divine judgement espoused by
patriarchal religion.</p>

<h2 id="MorPhi">5. Moral Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s fiction explores situations of moral conflict and
dilemma. For example, should a wife leave an abusive and/or adulterous
marriage (see &ldquo;Janet&rsquo;s Repentance&rdquo; and
<em>Romola</em>)? Eliot also depicts protagonists struggling to choose
an overall ethical orientation: between passion and duty (<em>The Mill
on the Floss</em>), or between conformity and rebellion
(<em>Romola</em> again). Her treatment of these cases consistently
emphasizes their complexity, resists formulaic solutions, and rejects
the view that absolute and general moral principles can reliably guide
moral judgements. &ldquo;There is no master key that will fit all
cases&rdquo;, states the narrator of <em>The Mill on the Floss</em>.
Moral judgements must therefore be &ldquo;checked and enlightened by a
perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the
individual lot&rdquo; (MF III: 264).</p>

<p>
The ethical outlook dramatized in Eliot&rsquo;s fiction is resolutely
humanist and secular. In an early essay she echoes Spinoza and
Feuerbach in rejecting the supernaturalist doctrinal framework
underpinning Christian ethics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I am just and honest, not because I expect to live in another world,
but because, having felt the pain of injustice and dishonesty towards
myself, I have a fellow-feeling with other men, who would suffer the
same pain if I were unjust or dishonest towards them&hellip; I have a
tender love for my wife, and children, and friends, and through that
love I sympathize with like affections in other men. It is a pang to
me to witness the suffering of a fellow-being, and I feel his
suffering the more acutely because he is <em>mortal</em>&mdash;because
his life is so short. (Eliot 1857: 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot believed that Jesus&rsquo;s teachings, documented in the New
Testament, included &ldquo;false views and expectations&rdquo;, and
she argued that Christianity&rsquo;s &ldquo;dualistic theory&mdash;the
antithesis of God and the world&rdquo;&mdash;fostered &ldquo;an
egotistic seeking for &lsquo;salvation&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Letters</em>
8: 26&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Eliot also criticizes moralism, both in life and in art. She
frequently draws a normative contrast between &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wide&rdquo; views, signifying, respectively, excessively
moralistic judgement and sympathetic tolerance. In a review of
Goethe&rsquo;s novel <em>Wilhelm Meister&rsquo;s Apprenticeship</em>,
she argues that &ldquo;the line between the virtuous and vicious, so
far from being a necessary safeguard to morality, is itself an immoral
fiction&rdquo; (Eliot 1855b: 703).</p>

<h3 id="MetEthThe">5.1 Meta-ethical theory</h3>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s moral particularism led James Sully to claim that
&ldquo;George Eliot gives us a life-like picture of the moral
struggle, and not a theory of it&rdquo; (Sully 1881: 391). However,
this claim is too hasty: it is possible to reconstruct several
meta-ethical claims from Eliot&rsquo;s fiction. To begin with, the
insistence on &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; in the passage quoted above
from <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> highlights the moral significance
of the concept of the milieu deployed in Eliot&rsquo;s novels (see
 <a href="#Mil">&sect;3.2</a>).
 Duty is another moral concept that structures her thinking,
accompanied by the claim that particular duties must be determined
with reference to each individual&rsquo;s situation. Eliot&rsquo;s
sustained interest in the concepts of character and habit situates her
moral thinking within the virtue ethics tradition (see
 <a href="#Cha">&sect;3.1</a>).
 At times she espouses an exemplarist moral theory that foregrounds
the concept of imitation; here we may detect the influence of
Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> as well as more contemporary works
such as Carlyle&rsquo;s <em>Heroes</em> and Emerson&rsquo;s
<em>Representative Men</em> (see
 <a href="#TriSig">&sect;3.4</a>).
 Her interest in the concept of a character &ldquo;type&rdquo;, going
back to Theophrastus&rsquo;s <em>Characters</em>, suggests a
meta-ethical view that fuses virtue theory and exemplarism.</p>

<p>
Eliot is explicitly critical of utilitarianism, particularly insofar
as this approach depends on the calculation of consequences. One line
of argument appeals to the nature of moral agents. Eliot suggests that
moral motivation is largely emotional, and that the emotions are
fundamentally unsuited to calculative thinking. As the narrator of
&ldquo;Janet&rsquo;s Repentance&rdquo; puts it, &ldquo;emotion is
obstinately irrational: it insists on caring for individuals; it
absolutely refuses to adopt the quantitative view of human
anguish&rdquo; (SCL 253). A second line of argument, also advanced in
this text, focuses on the nature of suffering. This, Eliot claims,
cannot be quantified: &ldquo;human pain refuses to be settled by
equations&rdquo; (SCL 254). Such direct statements are only part of
Eliot&rsquo;s argumentative strategy, which is also dramatic or
performative. The statements just quoted, for example, are made in the
course of a narrative that has already engaged readers&rsquo; emotions
to make them care intensely about an individual character and her
particular life story.</p>

<p>
A third line of argument against utilitarianism targets
consequentialism as such. While Eliot&rsquo;s novels tend to insist
that people cannot escape the consequences of their own actions, they
also emphasize the difficulty of predicting consequences in advance.
This idea is developed but also qualified in <em>Impression of
Theophrastus Such</em>, where Eliot&rsquo;s narrator voices scepticism
about a consequentialist ethical theory based on concepts of rational
deliberation and free choice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Few lives are shaped, few characters formed, by the contemplation of
definite consequences seen from a distance and made the goal of
continuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoided danger: such
control by foresight, such vivid picturing and practical logic are the
distinction of exceptionally strong natures; but society is chiefly
made up of human beings whose daily acts are all performed either in
unreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate
promptings of thought or feeling to execute an immediate purpose. (ITS
90&ndash;91)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Eliot&rsquo;s use of terms such as &ldquo;few&rdquo; and
&ldquo;chiefly&rdquo; illustrates her principled resistance to
universalist statements.</p>

<p>
In <em>Middlemarch</em> Eliot offers a somewhat different epistemic
critique of consequentialism, by claiming that consequences are
difficult or impossible to know not only in advance, but also in
retrospect. <em>Middlemarch</em>&rsquo;s narrator concludes the novel
by observing, of its heroine, that &ldquo;the effect of
[Dorothea&rsquo;s] being on those around her was incalculably
diffusive&rdquo; (M III: 465). This claim is not restricted to
Dorothea; it is itself diffused over an indefinite range of
&ldquo;acts&rdquo; which contribute to the overall &ldquo;good of the
world&rdquo;. The meta-ethical proposal here is that since the
&ldquo;effects&rdquo; of actions cannot be calculated, they cannot
provide a basis for moral judgement.</p>

<h3 id="Sym">5.2 Sympathy</h3>

<p>
The concept of sympathy at the heart of Eliot&rsquo;s moral philosophy
is indebted to Feuerbach, whose <em>Essence of
Christianity</em>&mdash;which Eliot translated in the early
1850s&mdash;made &ldquo;suffering in common&rdquo; a foundation for
ethical life (Feuerbach 1854: 53; see Griffin 2017; Anger 2001
[2019]). In Eliot&rsquo;s novels, sympathy is a cognitive and
emotional achievement, rooted in natural human feelings that are in
need of cultivation and correction. Sympathy provides an antidote to
another prevailing human tendency: harsh moral judgements of others.
The narrator of &ldquo;Janet&rsquo;s Repentance&rdquo; praises
&ldquo;deep-sighted sympathy which is wiser than all blame, more
potent than all reproof&rdquo; (SCL 203). In <em>Middlemarch</em>,
sympathy&rsquo;s cognitive power is accentuated through a key scene of
emotional crisis, where Dorothea finds that all her &ldquo;vivid
sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power&rdquo;,
illuminating her practical reason &ldquo;as acquired knowledge asserts
itself and will not let us see as we saw in the day of our
ignorance&rdquo; (M II: 321).</p>

<p>
Like Spinoza and Hegel, Feuerbach set out an account of human
relations that emphasizes both interdependence and difference:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we two cannot be without each other&hellip;only community constitutes
humanity&hellip; between me and another human being there is an
essential, qualitative distinction. (Feuerbach 1850: 158&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Eliot, similarly, sympathy involves both commonality and otherness
(Ermarth 1985). Scholars have debated whether Eliot shifted her
emphasis from commonality to difference over the course of her
literary career, or maintained a more dialectical view of these two
concepts throughout her work (Hollander 2013: 62&ndash;87; Albrecht
2020). Either way, Eliot is certainly attentive to the limits of
sympathy, and to its limited efficacy. <em>Middlemarch</em>&rsquo;s
Dorothea Brooke naively &ldquo;expected to walk in full
communion&rdquo; with her husband (M II: 3), and finds herself unable
to do so. In <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> Maggie Tulliver tells her
brother Tom that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You can&rsquo;t quite judge for me&mdash;our natures are very
different. You don&rsquo;t know how differently things affect me from
what they do you. (MF III: 59)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot, a famously consoling writer, can be sceptical about
consolation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We are all islands&hellip;and this seclusion is sometimes the most
intensely felt at the very moment your friend is caressing you or
consoling you,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
she wrote to a friend in 1854, a few weeks after completing her
translation of Feuerbach (Eliot to Cara Bray, 19 May 1854;
<em>Letters</em> 2: 156).</p>

<p>
The obstacles to sympathy are the obstacles to moral growth. Chief
among them is egotism (see
 <a href="#SelCen">&sect;3.3</a>).
 Yet there are other, more aesthetic obstacles, such as snobbery and
xenophobia. In an early essay Eliot denounces &ldquo;the vulgarity of
exclusiveness&rdquo; (Eliot 1856b: 54) and her novels depict both
social and aesthetic snobbery; she is not above exploring the
difficulty of feeling common humanity with someone who is
unattractive, overweight, or poorly dressed. &ldquo;It is needful that
I should have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar
citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely-assorted cravat and
waistcoat&rdquo; remarks the narrator of <em>Adam Bede</em> (AB I:
271). Insofar as the moral problem is aesthetic, so the remedy is
aesthetic: Eliot&rsquo;s novels dramatize a sympathetic way of
&ldquo;seeing&rdquo;, or of paying attention. <em>Adam Bede</em>, for
example, depicts unattractive people who are indeed loved, and
therefore lovable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Yes! thank God [exclaims the narrator], human feeling [i.e., love] is
like the mighty rivers that bless the earth: it does not wait for
beauty&mdash;it flows with resistless force and brings beauty with it.
(AB I: 269)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is precisely what the compassionate gaze of Eliot&rsquo;s
narrators attempts to do for her widely assorted characters, who
possess various mixtures of physical and moral flaws.</p>

<p>
The ideals of feeling-with, thinking-with, and seeing-with embedded in
Eliot&rsquo;s concept of sympathy are integral to the practice of
intellectual companionship she undertakes as a philosopher and artist
(see
 <a href="#PhiMet">&sect;2</a>).
 Rational argument is considered a reliable philosophical tool insofar
as reason is communicable and universal (or, more modestly, commands
broad regional consensus). The affects have an equivalent claim to
communicability and commonality (see
 <a href="#ThoFee">&sect;3.5</a>)
 only if the &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; element within emotional
intelligence and intuitive understanding carries a comparably
compelling force. The communicative success of Eliot&rsquo;s novels
constitutes her primary argument in favour of this view.</p>

<h3 id="SocEth">5.3 Social ethics</h3>

<p>
While Eliot&rsquo;s writings frequently reference political events and
issues, her approach to such matters is more moral than political.
Broadly speaking, she maintained a hope for both individual and
collective moral progress. Politically, she favoured gradual and
moderate reform, rather than revolution, because she believed that
continuity with the past is the essence of culture. From <em>Felix
Holt: The Radical</em> onwards, her thinking about the role of art
within the national political arena engaged closely with Mill&rsquo;s
&ldquo;On Representative Government&rdquo; and Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
<em>Culture and Anarchy</em> (Gallagher 1985: 217&ndash;267). Her
consideration of these questions is characteristically attuned to
ambiguity.</p>

<p>
Eliot&rsquo;s art engages in intensive yet subtle ways with what
Victorians called &ldquo;the Woman Question&rdquo;. She returns
repeatedly to the question of female vocation; several of her female
characters struggle to find intellectual or artistic fulfilment.
Marriage is explored in all her novels, especially but not exclusively
from a female point of view. In keeping with her moral particularism,
Eliot considers broadly moral benefits and harms within a series of
particular marriages. She gives close attention to marital violence
and coercive control: variations on this theme appear in
&ldquo;Janet&rsquo;s Repentance&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Lifted Veil&rdquo;,
<em>Romola</em>, <em>Middlemarch</em>, and <em>Daniel Deronda</em>.
Her analysis of two unhappy marriages in <em>Middlemarch</em> mirrors
Hegel&rsquo;s account of the master-slave dialectic in <em>The
Phenomenology of Spirit</em>, which Eliot studied while writing the
novel. Drawing on the Hegelian theme of recognition, Eliot&rsquo;s
depiction of the Casaubons and the Lydgates explores how a partnership
can be mutually destructive: all these partners misrecognize one
another, because they imagine their prospective spouse according to
their own desires (Armstrong 2020; Carlisle 2023: 190&ndash;98).
Eliot&rsquo;s most radically feminist critique of marriage occurs in
<em>Daniel Deronda</em>, where the heroine, feeling compelled to marry
for money, enters an abusive marriage portrayed as <em>de facto</em>
prostitution, with disastrous psychological consequences.</p>

<p>
Eliot was cautiously supportive of widening women&rsquo;s access to
higher education. In 1869 her friends Barbara Bodichon and Emily
Davies founded Cambridge&rsquo;s first women&rsquo;s college, to which
Eliot&mdash;who was by then wealthy as a consequence of her
bestselling novels&mdash;donated a relatively modest &pound;50. Her
writing is more emphatic in highlighting the paucity of women&rsquo;s
education and considering its diverse effects on different female
characters. <em>Middlemarch</em>&rsquo;s Rosamond Vincy, whose shallow
education does nothing to reform her vain, self-centred character,
exemplifies Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s ingenious argument that giving
women equal access to education will be beneficial to men. In a brief
essay on Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s <em>The Vindication of the Rights of
Women</em> (1792), Eliot endorses the view that &ldquo;so far as
obstinacy is concerned, your unreasoning animal is the most
unmanageable of creatures&rdquo;: in other words, an
&ldquo;unreasoning&rdquo; wife will be troublesome to her husband
(Eliot 1855c: 988&ndash;9; Carlisle 2023: 196&ndash;7). The plot of
<em>Middlemarch</em> exposes Dr Lydgate&rsquo;s error in fearing
intellectual women, since Rosamond, his wife, turns out to be a far
more formidable adversary.</p>

<p>
In her late works <em>Daniel Deronda</em> and <em>Impressions of
Theophrastus Such</em>, Eliot gives sustained attention to race and
nationality. Both texts examine antisemitism, and advocate for a
Jewish state (Anderson 1997). Less overtly, <em>Daniel Deronda</em>
puts forward a moral critique of the British Empire, personified by
the coercive cruelty of &ldquo;white-handed&rdquo; aristocrat Henleigh
Grandcourt, and highlights the Church of England&rsquo;s complicity in
colonial and patriarchal violence via its depiction of a hypocritical
clergyman, Henry Gascoigne (DD III: 74; Henry 2001 [2019]; Carlisle
2023: 221). In a letter to the American abolitionist Harriet Beecher
Stowe, written shortly after the publication of <em>Daniel
Deronda</em>, Eliot extends its critique of antisemitism to other
forms of racism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
not only towards the Jews, but towards all oriental peoples with whom
we English come into contact, a spirit of arrogance and contemptuous
dictatorialness is observable which has become a national disgrace.
There is nothing I should care more to do, if it were possible, than
to rouse the imagination of men and women to a vision of human claims
in those races of their fellow-men who most differ from them in their
customs and beliefs. (<em>Letters</em> 6: 301)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Theophrastus Such, an Englishman, states directly that &ldquo;we are a
colonizing people, and it is we who have punished others&rdquo; (ITS
264; Henry 2001 [2019]).</p>

<h2 id="Inf">6. Influence</h2>

<p>
At the end of <em>Middlemarch</em>, Eliot&rsquo;s narrator remarks
that its heroine&rsquo;s influence on others has been
&ldquo;incalculably diffusive&rdquo;. Although George Eliot, already
during her lifetime a celebrated novelist whose works inspired
reverence as well as critical acclaim, was very different from the
obscure, &ldquo;unhistoric&rdquo; Dorothea Brooke, this remark does
apply in one sense to Eliot herself. Her novels, in English and in
translation, have been and continue to be very widely read (and
re-read) by ordinary people, including schoolchildren. Few other
philosophers are so diffusively influential as George Eliot.</p>

<p>
It perhaps goes without saying that a nineteenth-century woman who
pursued her philosophical work in the medium of fiction was taken less
seriously, as a philosopher, than contemporaries such as J. S. Mill
and Herbert Spencer. Nevertheless, Nietzsche took George Eliot
seriously enough to deem her worthy of insult. In <em>Twilight of the
Idols</em> he treats Eliot (a &ldquo;little moral female&rdquo;) as
the prime example of English &ldquo;moralists&rdquo; who reject
Christian belief only to cling more tightly to Christian morality
(Nietzsche 1889: <em lang="de">Streifz&uuml;ge eines
Unzeitgem&auml;ssen</em> &sect;5 [2005: 193]). Here Nietzsche displays
his ignorance of the sophistication and complexity of Eliot&rsquo;s
moral thinking; his own naturalistic, physiological ethics were
indebted to an English philosophical tradition that Eliot, along with
Spencer and Lewes, helped to shape (see Staten 2014: 1&ndash;9). In
the 1870s and 80s Sigmund Freud read and admired <em>Middlemarch</em>
and <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, and may have been influenced by
Eliot&rsquo;s study of the effects of &ldquo;suppressed
experience&rdquo; (DD II: 120) on psychological and emotional
development, as well as by her subtle explorations of female
experience in particular (see Jones 1953: 131, 168, 174; Rotenberg
1999). As a consequence of her abusive marriage, the heroine of
<em>Daniel Deronda</em> displays symptoms of nervous disorders, such
as hysteria and anorexia nervosa, that were receiving scientific
attention at that time (Vrettos 1990; Matus 2008; Carlisle 2023:
221&ndash;2, 342&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
While philosophers throughout history, at least since Plato, have
experimented with literary form in ways that are not philosophically
trivial, Eliot exerted a decisive influence on new convergences
between philosophy and literature during the twentieth century. As
some contemporary critics recognized, <em>Middlemarch</em>
&ldquo;marks an epoch in the history of fiction&rdquo; insofar as its
interest in subjectivity and inter-subjectivity determines &ldquo;the
form in which the conception is placed before us&rdquo; (Simcox 1873).
Eliot exerted a profound influence on Anglophone modernism, with its
distinctive attention to the relation between truth and literary form.
Virginia Woolf and Henry James, for example, were direct heirs to her
literary innovations. Eliot&rsquo;s novels, not least her
semi-autobiographical <em>The Mill on the Floss</em>, were also
formative for Proust and Simone de Beauvoir, whose own experiments in
life-writing were the medium for their philosophical work (see Fraser
1994: 87&ndash;113; Gobeil 1965). In light of such influence&mdash;and
arguably because of, as well as despite, its diffusiveness&mdash;Eliot
can justly be regarded as the progenitor of the modern philosophical
novel.</p>

<p>
In the second half of the twentieth century, literary formalism shaped
scholarly and critical practices in the humanities. This disciplinary
development produced techniques of close reading that have been
applied, in return, to Eliot&rsquo;s novels&mdash;above all
<em>Middlemarch</em>&mdash;to reveal their power, intricacy and
originality as works of both art and philosophy.</p>
