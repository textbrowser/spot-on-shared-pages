<h1>The Nonidentity Problem</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jul 21, 2009; substantive revision Fri Jul 19, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The nonidentity problem raises questions regarding both the moral
obligations agents have in respect of possible future people &ndash;
people, that is, who do not yet but may exist at some future time
&ndash; and how those obligations (to the extent we have them) are
most credibly explained. It today remains among the most challenging
problems in all of population ethics.</p>

<p>
It is plausible to think that we are often obligated to make future
people &ndash; at least some of them &ndash; better off rather than
leaving them as they might otherwise be or making them worse off. But
on reflection it seems that any change we contemplate in respect of
any conduct we plan to engage in <em>prior</em> to a given
person&rsquo;s being conceived &ndash; even a change that would on its
face seem to represent a clear <em>improvement</em> for that future
person &ndash; will often fail to make <em>that</em> person better off
and often instead serve only to bring another person, a <em>better
off</em> person but still a <em>nonidentical</em> person, into
existence in place of the one. Thus the phenomenon Gregory Kavka
called the &ldquo;precariousness&rdquo; of existence (Kavka, 1982,
93): we all just barely missed never coming into existence at all. Had
our parents, or any of our more remote forebears, done anything other
than what they in fact did &ndash; had they, for example, with the aim
of making things better for <em>us</em>, delayed their conception of a
child for a few months or years until they were better prepared to
take care of a child &ndash; the odds overwhelmingly seem to favor
<em>our</em> never having existed at all. That is, after all, the way
of gamete production: neither sperm nor egg cells survive for very
long, and it is reasonable to suppose that a different egg and sperm
combination would have produced a distinct person. Even delays not of
months or years but of split seconds would seem very probably to
switch out the sperm cell that is set to do the inseminating for one
of its many, many cohorts and thus the identity of the person
conceived. Analogous points hold for changes in the manner of
conception and, even more obviously, for changes in the agent&rsquo;s choice
of whom to conceive a child with. Any of your forebears&rsquo;
well-meaning changes in conduct may well have resulted in the coming
into existence of a better off child. But for <em>you</em> the result
of any such change very probably would have been <em>your</em> never
having existed at all. </p>

<p>
A similar phenomenon arises on a global scale. Suppose, for example,
that we choose to take significant action today to mitigate the
effects of climate change in the future &ndash; and that we do so with
the aim of making future people better off. Will our choice make any
<em>particular</em> future person or collection of future people
better off? Probably not, according to the logic of the nonidentity
problem. After all, any significant climate action undertaken today
will surely affect the timing and manner of human conception on a very
wide scale over a very long period of time. Thus, according to the
logic of the nonidentity problem, our environmentally responsible
choice very probably will not make any particular person or collection
of future people better off than that collection would have been under
the environmentally reckless choice. It very probably will serve only
to bring an entirely distinct &ndash; better off but person-by-person
<em>nonidentical</em> &ndash; collection of future people into
existence instead.</p>

<p>
It is when those graphic facts of life are combined with a highly
intuitive constraint on just when a choice is morally wrong and when a
given possible outcome, or possible world or <em>future</em>, is
morally worse than another &ndash; that is, the <em>person affecting
intuition</em> &ndash; that what is called the <em>nonidentity
problem</em> arises.</p>

<p>
The person affecting intuition itself was described by Derek Parfit as
the idea that &ldquo;<em>what is bad must be bad for
someone</em>&rdquo; (Parfit 1987, 363). Jan Narveson wittily
articulated just how that intuition functions to constrain an
otherwise compelling utilitarian sentiment that, taken too far, may
seem highly implausible: moral agents are (of course) in favor of
&ldquo;making people happy&rdquo; but (surely) &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;
about &ldquo;making happy people&rdquo; (Narveson, 1976, 73).</p>

<p>
How, exactly, does that simple intuition give rise to a problem? The
person affecting intuition, when combined with the fact that the
coming into existence of any particular person is highly precarious,
seems to insist that, when it comes to the future-directed,
identity-affecting choices that we make, we can &ldquo;do no
wrong.&rdquo; Even imagined improvements in our original choice that
we might contemplate making with the aim of making things better for
some particular future person or another very often will have the
effect not of making things better for that person but rather of
leaving that person out of existence altogether. On the assumption
that that person&rsquo;s existence under the original choice is worth having
and that no one else is affected, the person affecting intuition is
generally understood to compel the conclusion that our original
choice, not being &ldquo;bad for&rdquo; that person at all (if anything, it
<em>benefits</em> that person; in bestowing on that person the gift of
life, it <em>increases</em> what we can call that person&rsquo;s
<em>wellbeing</em>), isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;bad&rdquo;: it isn&rsquo;t, that is, morally wrong and
doesn&rsquo;t make the possible future it helps to bring about morally worse
than any other.</p>

<p>
Surely, however, it is not the case that we can &ldquo;do no
wrong&rdquo; with respect to the future-directed, identity-affecting
choices that we make. More plausibly, such choices are on many
occasions morally wrong and the futures that include such choices
morally worse: as when, for example, we fail to prepare ourselves
properly to care for our own future children or fail to serve as
environmentally responsible moral agents on behalf of future
generations who, just like us, will be in need of a climate conducive
to good health.</p>

<p>
By the 1980s, the nonidentity problem had become widely recognized.
Once recognized, it then seemed immediately obvious to many moral
philosophers &ndash; including many consequentialists &ndash; how the
inconsistency was to be avoided. It seemed obvious that a more
credible moral theory would simply reject the person affecting
intuition and instead adopt a structure that is <em>impersonal</em>
rather than <em>person affecting</em> in nature. The paradigm example
of such a theory is classic maximizing total utilitarianism (the
&ldquo;total theory&rdquo;). On that theory, agents are to focus, not on making
<em>particular</em> people better off, but rather on bringing it about
that, regardless of just <em>who</em> does or will exist, the
<em>collection</em> of all those people has as much wellbeing on an
<em>aggregate</em> basis as any <em>alternate</em> collection of
people who could have existed instead. That our choice isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;bad for&rdquo;
any <em>particular</em> future person becomes, under the total theory,
morally irrelevant: a choice may be deemed morally wrong, and the
future that choice gives rise to deemed morally worse, even if that
choice makes things worse for no one who does or will exist in that
future at all.</p>

<p>
The move to impersonalism &ndash; to, for example, the total theory
&ndash; doesn&rsquo;t, however, end the discussion. For we then come face to
face with still another challenging population problem, that is, the
<em>repugnant conclusion</em>. Having dropped the person affecting
intuition, the total theory would seem to obligate us (in Narveson&rsquo;s
words) to make people happy <em>and</em> to make happy people. But in
balancing those two moral desiderata, we find that our obligation on
occasion will be to make additional happy people even though our doing
so comes at a grave cost to still other people, people who do or will
exist and who would have been better off under the choice that creates
fewer people rather than under the choice to create more. Thus
consider the collection &ldquo;A&rdquo; consisting of a large number of future
people whose lives will be <em>well</em> worth living, and compare it
against a collection &ldquo;Z&rdquo; consisting of all the A-people together with
a very large number of additional future people, with each A-person
and each additional person now having a life only <em>barely</em>
worth living. In a case where the future that contains the Z-people
maximizes aggregate wellbeing, the total theory deems that future
morally better than the future that contains the A-people alone, with
the morally better future being the one that (given that there exists
no still better future) we are morally obligated to aim to bring
about. But can that conclusion really be correct? Parfit himself found
it &ldquo;repugnant&rdquo; (Parfit, 1987, 380&ndash;390; see also
 <a href="../repugnant-conclusion/">repugnant conclusion</a>).
 And it would seem to be, on its face, the sort of &ldquo;moral&rdquo;
edict we would resist, indeed, defy &ndash; just as we would defy, in
the more local, closer-to-home case the edict that we are in many
cases obligated to produce ever more offspring even when our doing so
would make things much worse for the (one or two or more) existing or
future children we might ourselves otherwise have preferred to
produce.</p>

<p>
Notably, the repugnant conclusion has itself been challenged, on the
grounds that either the conclusion itself is not truly repugnant or
that almost all credible population theories give rise to some form of
the repugnant conclusion or another (Zuber et al., 2021, Tannsjo
2002). Still, Parfit&rsquo;s early assessment of the conclusion as
&ldquo;repugnant&rdquo; continues to be the dominant view in moral
philosophy writ large, and the repugnant conclusion, together with the
nonidentity problem, continues to define the basic contours of the
contemporary controversy surrounding the person affecting
intuition.</p>

<p>
It is thus generally thought that to solve the nonidentity problem is
to produce a theory that accounts for the obligations we intuitively
believe we have in respect of possible future people without enmeshing
ourselves in any of the other serious problems that together
constitute the area of population ethics. It&rsquo;s &ndash; among
other things &ndash; to identify a &ldquo;Theory X&rdquo; (Parfit
1987, 378) that manages to avoid the nonidentity problem <em>and</em>
the repugnant conclusion. The path forward hasn&rsquo;t, however, been easy
or obvious. For that reason and others, the nonidentity problem opens
the door to significant and still unsettled questions regarding the
nature and structure of moral law.</p>

<h2 id="Prob">1. Construction the Problem; Strategies for Solving the Problem</h2>

<p>
As noted earlier, the person affecting intuition is a central
component in the construction of the nonidentity problem. Indeed, it
was originally considered the <em>target</em> of the nonidentity
problem.</p>

<p>
Many different formulations of the person affecting intuition appear
in the literature (see Roberts 2024, 4&ndash;5 n. 8). For purposes of this
entry, formulations that are widely agreed to fail on grounds other
than the nonidentity problem are set aside. John Broome, for example,
considers a formulation he calls the <em>neutrality intuition</em>,
according to which bringing an additional person into existence within
a certain &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; range of wellbeing levels leaves the one future
(other things equal) exactly as good as the other. As Broome argues,
however, the neutrality intuition is clearly false (Broome 2004,
143&ndash;149).</p>

<p>
An initial, more cautious formulation, and one that tracks Parfit&rsquo;s
original formulation (&ldquo;what is bad must be bad for someone,&rdquo; Parfit
1987, 363 (emphasis deleted); cf. Parfit 2017), is as follows: a
choice made at a given outcome, or possible world or future, is
morally wrong, and makes the one future worse than a second, only if
that choice makes things worse for, or harms, or is otherwise &ldquo;bad
for,&rdquo; at least one person who does or will exist in the one future.
</p>

<p>
This initial formulation is cautious in three respects. First, it
avoids assigning any special moral status to people who do or will
exist in the <em>actual</em> world over people who do or will exist in
alternate <em>merely possible</em> worlds. Consistent with the initial
formulation, we may freely assign moral status to merely possible
people who inhabit futures that themselves never in point of fact
&ndash; that never <em>actually</em> &ndash; obtain. (For arguments
against <em>moral actualism</em>, see Hare 2007; Roberts 2024,
45&ndash;49; see also part 4 below.) Second, it provides only a
necessary, and not a sufficient, condition on when a choice is wrong
or makes things morally worse; relatedly, the condition it provides is
a condition only on moral wrongness and moral worseness, not on moral
betterness. (See Roberts 2024, 4&ndash;5n.8 and 60&ndash;61.) Third, it leaves
open the question of just which future it is that makes the person who
is <em>worse</em> off in the one future <em>better</em> off. Often,
the reference is assumed to be to the second future (we would say one
future is worse than a second only if the one future is worse for a
person who does or will exist in that future than the second is for
that same person). In fact, however, to avoid the risk of starting off
with a formulation that cannot be made to work, the question of how
that blank is to be filled in must be left open.</p>

<p>
Though cautious, this initial formulation of the intuition, together
with the phenomenon of the precariousness of existence and once
combined with a handful of seemingly uncontroversial ancillary claims,
is enough to trigger the nonidentity problem.</p>

<p>
Some of those ancillary claims are moral in nature; others are more
conceptual, metaphysical or even epistemological in nature. When it
comes to identifying a credible way to avoid the inconsistency the
nonidentity problem gives rise to, however, close scrutiny not just of
the central claims but also of each seemingly uncontroversial
ancillary claim is in order.</p>

<p>
The discussion that follows begins with a proposed solution that
boldly questions one of those ancillary (and already referenced)
claims: that the future-directed, identity-affecting choices under
scrutiny in the various nonidentity cases really are, in the main,
morally wrong and really do make the futures that arise out of those
choices morally worse than still other futures. As the nonidentity
cases themselves suggest (for a list, see part 2 below), that claim
comes with strong intuitive support. Nonetheless, a few theorists have
aimed to solve the problem by rejecting that claim. And indeed a
narrow class of nonidentity cases involving highly personal,
procreative choices may well seem to throw that claim into question.
Was it, for example, wrong for your parents to have a child with each
other and, eventually, to produce you rather than to have a child with
an alternate partner who (let&rsquo;s suppose) would have brought to
the table the sort of superior genetic contribution that would have
increased wellbeing? We might think that it wasn&rsquo;t. For
discussion of this &ldquo;bite the bullet&rdquo; proposal, see part 3.1 below.</p>

<p>
More commonly, theorists, including many consequentialists, have
viewed the nonidentity problem as a counterexample against the person
affecting intuition and have thus aimed to solve the problem by simply
rejecting that intuition in favor of a purely impersonal, aggregative
approach. Keeping the repugnant conclusion in mind, however, those
same theorists have proposed novel versions of the total theory,
versions designed to avoid the repugnant conclusion without the help
of the person affecting intuition. Still other theorists, who also can
be understood as working within a basic consequentialist framework,
attempt to thread the needle between the nonidentity problem and the
repugnant conclusion by adopting a pluralistic approach, one that
recognizes both impersonal values (thus addressing the nonidentity
problem) and person affecting values (thus going some way in
addressing the repugnant conclusion). See part 3.2 below.</p>

<p>
Still other theorists, seeking to retain the person affecting
intuition without giving up the claim that the choices under scrutiny
in the nonidentity cases really are wrong and really do make things
worse, aim to solve the nonidentity problem by disconnecting the
notions of when it is that a choice makes things <em>worse for</em> a
person and when it is that a choice is <em>bad for</em> a person.
Conceding that, given the precariousness of existence, the choice
under scrutiny in any given nonidentity case does not make things
worse for the future person it ushers into existence (assuming, of
course, that that existence is itself worth having), they argue that
that same choice nonetheless harms or wrongs or is otherwise bad for
that person. See part 3.3 below,</p>

<p>
A handful of theorists, also seeking to retain the person affecting
intuition and the claim that the choices under scrutiny really are
wrong and really do make things worse, have questioned some of the
ancillary conceptual or metaphysical claims that ground seemingly
compelling claims regarding the precariousness of existence. Thus in
constructing the problem certain very definite claims regarding what
it is for a person <em>p</em> to be the same person as a person
<em>q</em>, when it is that a nonidentical person <em>q</em> exists
instead of a person <em>p</em> and, ultimately, when it is that &ldquo;a
person&rdquo; is made worse off are at work. The question has, however,
emerged whether those claims &ndash; in effect, those assumptions
&ndash; do not inappropriately block various natural descriptions of
the cases that nicely avoid the nonidentity problem. See part 3.4
below.</p>

<p>
Still other theorists have questioned whether facts regarding the
precariousness of existence in fact support the position that a given
person&rsquo;s coming into existence is more probable under the choice that
we agree is wrong than that same person&rsquo;s existence is under an
alternate choice that we agree is permissible. That more epistemic
proposal, which applies just to some but not all types of nonidentity
cases, argues that the &ldquo;no harm done&rdquo; result rests on a certain
fallacy in reasoning regarding the relevant probabilities. By avoiding
the fallacy, we can explain how the wrong choice after all harms
&ndash; makes things worse for &ndash; the future person whose future
plight has triggered our concern and thus explain, in person affecting
terms, why that choice is wrong and the future that it gives rise to
is worse than others. See part 3.5 below.</p>

<p>
Taking another tack entirely, many theorists are happy to reject both
the consequentialist framework itself <em>and</em> the person
affecting intuition. Such theorists may aim to account for the
wrongness of many future-directed, identity-affecting choices by
reference to facts about the agent&rsquo;s character, motives or
intentions rather than by reference to the consequences the choice
under scrutiny generates for anyone at all. See part 3.6 below.</p>

<p>
Just as the repugnant conclusion (arguably) puts guardrails on
proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem, so do certain other
problems in population ethics, including what is called &ldquo;the
asymmetry.&rdquo; This entry concludes with a note on that problem. See part
4 below.</p>

<h2 id="NoniCase">2. Nonidentity Cases</h2>

<p>
As noted earlier, the identity of any person plausibly depends on just
who the genetic parents of that person happen to be. As Parfit
observes, the woman who wonders who she would have been had her
&ldquo;parents married other people&rdquo; &ldquo;ignores the
answer,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;no one&rdquo; (Parfit 1987, 351). But
the timing and manner of conception are also critical. Had the timing
of any one conception or the manner of that conception been changed,
the result very probably would have been the conception of a distinct
child altogether. (Parfit 1987, 351&ndash;55; 2011 vol. 2,
217&ndash;231). Moreover, the exact timing and manner of conception is
itself highly susceptible to variations in whatever complex chain of
acts and events it is that has come before. Much of what has been done
in human history, had it been done differently, would surely have
undone the conceptions of vast numbers of people. &ldquo;[H]ow many of
us could truly claim, &lsquo;Even if railways and motor cars had never
been invented, I would still have been born&rsquo;?&rdquo; (Parfit
1987, 361).</p>

<p>
Consider, then, a choice <em>c1</em> that is made at a possible world
or future <em>f1</em> and that eventually results in one or more
people having positive but low wellbeing levels in <em>f1</em>. And
suppose that, at the time of choice, those very same people have not
yet been conceived. Suppose, too, that the reason wellbeing levels
will be low is that <em>c1</em> performed at <em>f1</em> will cause
those very same people to suffer in various ways (say, from disease,
deprivation or limitation). And suppose that that suffering cannot be
justified (on, say, the ground that it is necessary to save many other
people from suffering still more). When agents, at the time of choice,
had an alternate choice <em>c2</em> at an alternate possible future
<em>f2</em> that would have avoided that suffering altogether, we may
well be convinced that <em>c1</em> at <em>f1</em>is wrong. The problem
is that in many such cases &ndash; and it takes just one to generate a
counterexample against the person affecting intuition &ndash; choosing
<em>c2</em> in place of <em>c1</em> very probably would also have
changed the timing and manner of the conceptions that take place at
<em>f1</em>. Thus <em>c2</em> would not have made things better for
the people who will eventually exist at <em>f1</em> but rather would
have caused those particular people &ndash; each and every one of them
&ndash; very probably to have been left out of existence at
<em>f2</em> altogether. To put the point another way, the suffering
<em>c1</em> imposes on the people who will eventually exist in
<em>f1</em> seems very probably <em>unavoidable</em> if those
particular people are ever to exist at all. (They all
&ldquo;owe&rdquo; their &ldquo;very existence&rdquo; to agents&rsquo;
choosing <em>c1</em> at <em>f1</em> rather than <em>c2</em> at
<em>f2</em>.) That, in turn, makes it hard to see how <em>c1</em> has
made things worse for, or harmed, or otherwise been bad for, anyone
who does or will exist in <em>f1</em> in any &ldquo;morally relevant
way&rdquo; (Parfit 1987, 361&ndash;63, 374).</p>

<h3 id="Depl">2.1 Depletion</h3>

<p>
In Parfit&rsquo;s depletion case, we are to suppose that agents as a
community have chosen to deplete rather than conserve certain natural
resources. The consequences of that choice for the people who exist
now or will come into existence over the next two centuries will be
&ldquo;slightly&rdquo; better than under a conservation alternative
(Parfit 1987, 362; see also Parfit 2011 (vol. 2), 218). After that
period, however, the quality of life would be much lower. Yet at the
same time the depletion choice would seem very probably to make things
worse for, or harm, or otherwise be bad for, no existing or future
person at all. After all, while distant future people by hypothesis
will suffer as a result of the depletion choice, it is also true that
for each such person a conservation choice very probably would have
changed the timing and manner of the relevant conception. That change,
in turn, would have changed the identities of the people who
eventually exist. Assuming that the existences those distant future
people will have are worth having despite depletion, we seem forced to
conclude that the depletion choice does not make things worse for, or
harm, and is not otherwise bad for, any among those distant future
people at all. The person affecting intuition then forces a further
conclusion: that the depletion choice is not wrong and does not make
the future in which the depletion choice is made worse than any
alternate future. And thus the problem: for surely the &ldquo; great
lowering of the quality of life must provide some moral reason not to
choose Depletion&rdquo; (Parfit 1987, 361&ndash;364). Surely agents ought to
have chosen conservation instead.</p>

<p>
The risky policy case, also from Parfit, has a similar structure
(Parfit 1987, 371&ndash;72). So does the climate change case (Broome
1992; Parfit 2017, 122&ndash;123).</p>

<h3 id="SlavChil">2.2 The slave child</h3>

<p>
The same type of nonidentity problem arises but at a more local level
in Kavka&rsquo;s slave child case. In exchange for $50,000, a couple
enters into a binding contract according to which the couple will
conceive and bear a child who will be transferred at birth to a
wealthy man as a slave (Kavka 1982, 100). The child is conceived and
born pursuant to the contract &ndash; and, as a slave, suffers but
still has a life worth living. We think what the couple has done is
&ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; (Kavka 1982, 101). And at first glance we may
also think that that is so because of what the couple&rsquo;s choice
does to the slave child &ndash; specifically, that it makes things
worse for, or harms, or is otherwise bad for, that child. But the
logic of the nonidentity problem suggests otherwise. Had the couple
declined to enter the contract but still taken steps to produce a
child, the original child very probably would never have existed at
all. For that alternate sequence of choices very probably would have
produced a change in the timing and manner of conception. The
resulting child, as a nonslave, may well have been better off. But it
very probably would have been a child &ldquo;nonidentical&rdquo; to the original
(Kavka 1982, 100 n. 15). On those facts, we seem forced to conclude
that the couple&rsquo;s choice makes things worse for, or harms, or is
otherwise bad for, no existing or future person at all. According to
the person affecting intuition, what the couple has done therefore
isn&rsquo;t wrong and doesn&rsquo;t make things worse. But that result seems
clearly false.</p>

<p>
Kavka&rsquo;s &ldquo;pleasure pill&rdquo; case parallels the slave
child case (Kavka 1982, 98).</p>

<h3 id="N14YearOldGirl">2.3 The fourteen year old girl</h3>

<p>
Another case from Parfit on its face avoids any reliance on
probabilities and thus can be considered of a different type. His
&ldquo;fourteen year old girl&rdquo; case focuses on the fact that the egg cell a
young girl will produce soon after she becomes capable of conceiving a
child will not be the same egg cell as the one she will produce a
decade or more later. In Parfit&rsquo;s case, &ldquo;[t]his girl
chooses to have a child&rdquo; (Parfit 1987, 358). Yet we think that
it would have been better for the girl to wait &ldquo;for several
years&rdquo; to have a child and that, barring exceptional
circumstances, the girl&rsquo;s choice is wrong (Parfit 1987, 358).
But it also seems that that particular child, even if burdened by
having been born to a girl too young to be a good mother, practically
<em>could</em> not (versus probably <em>would</em> not) have existed
at all had the girl waited &ldquo;for several years&rdquo; to have a
child. Given that the child&rsquo;s life is worth living, it&rsquo;s
hard to see how the girl&rsquo;s choice can plausibly be said to have
made things worse for, or harmed, or otherwise have been &ldquo;bad
for,&rdquo; the child or (on some versions of the case) any other
existing or future person at all. On those facts, the person affecting
intuition insists that the young girl&rsquo;s choice was not wrong and does
not make things morally worse.</p>

<h3 id="WronLife">2.4 Wrongful life</h3>

<p>
The same type of nonidentity problem appears in defenses against the
cause of action in the law of negligence called <em>wrongful
life</em>. An action for wrongful life, by definition made on behalf
of the child rather than the parent, makes one or both of the
following claims: (1) medical professionals have failed properly to
advise couples of their risk of producing a child with a serious
genetic or chromosomal disorder or of the availability of technologies
that would have enabled them to reduce that risk; and (2) medical
professionals have failed to implement those technologies effectively.
The disorders at issue include Down syndrome and hereditary deafness,
and the available technologies include preconception genetic testing
and maternal blood screening. The proper use of the available
technologies could not have cured the underlying impairment. But their
proper use could have enabled the couple to produce a nonidentical,
presumptively better off, child instead. At the same time, it seems
clear that in most cases the impaired child&rsquo;s life will be (or
at least can be made to be) worth living. Can the child claim to have
been harmed &ndash; in the comparative, worse off sense of that term
that the law requires &ndash; by the very medical negligence to which
the child owes its very existence? It seems not. The law of negligence
itself being deeply steeped in the person affecting intuition, a
majority of courts have felt themselves forced to deny the child&rsquo;s
claim altogether.</p>

<p>
Parfit&rsquo;s &ldquo;two medical programs&rdquo; case &ndash;
specifically, the program that would encourage women who have a
certain condition that &ldquo;cannot be treated, but always disappears
within two months,&rdquo; to delay pregnancy &ndash; is structurally
similar to the wrongful life case (Parfit 1987, 367&ndash;368; Parfit
2011 vol. 2, 221&ndash;222; Parfit 2017, 121).</p>

<h3 id="HistInju">2.5 Historic injustices; reparations</h3>

<p>
The precariousness of existence raises the question whether historical
injustices &ndash; for example, U.S. slavery and the Holocaust &ndash;
can properly be said to make things worse for, or harm, or otherwise
be bad for, people who were not conceived until after the events
constituting the injustice have themselves concluded (Sher 2005;
Herstein 2008; Cohen 2009; Smilansky 2013). Here tracking the same
probabilistic logic that appears in the cases of depletion and the
slave child, the argument is that the choices under scrutiny very
probably do not make things worse for, or harm, and are not otherwise
bad for, any of the later-conceived progeny of the historical
injustice. Though those future people (stripped of family and family
resources) may be burdened in various ways as a result of the choices
that create the injustice, it is also true that alternate, seemingly
permissible choices very probably would have changed the timing and
manner of the relevant conceptions and thus have changed the
identities of the later-conceived people. We then seem forced to
conclude that the choices under scrutiny do not make things worse for,
or harm, and are not otherwise bad for, any of those future people at
all. Here, the person affecting intuition does not block the finding
that a wrong has been done or that the future that includes the
historic injustice is not worse than still others &ndash; the fact
that there existed many <em>contemporaneous</em> victims of the
historic injustice can&rsquo;t be undone. But if reparations (like
compensation under the law of negligence) requires that the person
claiming reparations have been harmed or made worse off &ndash; if it
requires <em>victims</em> rather than apparent <em>beneficiaries</em>
&ndash; then we seem forced to conclude that reparations to
later-conceived progeny are not owed. While that result may seem
plausible (&ldquo;[H]ow can any person have a claim to compensation
for a wrong that was a condition of her existence?&rdquo; (Cohen 2009,
81)), many theorists resist it. (See also
 <a href="../justice-intergenerational/">intergenerational justice</a>.)</p>
 
<h2 id="PropSoluNoniProb">3. Proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem</h2>

<h3 id="SeemWronActNotWronBitiBull">3.1 Seemingly wrong choice is not wrong; &ldquo;biting the bullet&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
For some philosophers, the person affecting intuition itself is beyond
question. Combining that intuition with the phenomenon of the
precariousness of existence and a certain ancillary, conceptual claim,
they reason to a conclusion that still other philosophers find deeply
troubling: that many, perhaps all, of the future-directed,
identity-affecting choices under scrutiny in the various nonidentity
cases are not, after all, morally wrong and do not make things morally
worse. They &ldquo;bite the bullet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
David Heyd accepts that conclusion even in the case in which the
existence that is brought about is <em>less</em> than worth having.
Notably, Heyd&rsquo;s position is driven mainly by his conceptual,
rather than his moral, intuitions. Heyd thus rejects what can be
called <em>nonexistence comparability</em> and instead takes the
position that comparisons between the wellbeing level a given person
has in a future in which that person exists and the wellbeing level
that same person has in a future in which that person never exists are
not cogent. However dire the case, in other words, the choice to bring
the child into existence <em>cannot</em> make things worse for or harm
(in the comparative, worse off sense of that term that Heyd accepts)
the child and thus <em>cannot</em> be wrong (Heyd 1992, 30&ndash;33;
Heyd, 2009). But for Heyd the conclusion that the choice is not wrong
doesn&rsquo;t imply that the choice is morally permissible. (Here,
Heyd rejects still another conceptual claim that others might find
highly plausible: the claim that choices that are not morally wrong
are morally permissible.) Rather, according to Heyd, the choice falls
into the category of the <em>genethical</em> and not the
straightforwardly ethical: it&rsquo;s neither morally permissible nor
morally wrong.</p>

<p>
Philosophers who accept the person affecting intuition but also accept
nonexistence comparability remain free to limit their &ldquo;bite the
bullet&rdquo; conclusion to the case where the existence under
scrutiny is at least worth having. Thus, David Boonin remains at least
neutral on nonexistence comparability (Boonin 2008, 130 and 135;
Boonin 2014; see also Bayne 2010; Risberg 2023). In that respect,
Boonin&rsquo;s position is more limited than Heyd&rsquo;s: for Boonin,
application of the person affecting intuition is restricted to those
cases in which the life at issue isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;worse than no life
at all&rdquo; (Boonin 2014, 2, 14, 17). </p>

<p>
In another respect as well, Boonin&rsquo;s approach is more limited
than Heyd&rsquo;s. At least some of Heyd&rsquo;s language suggests the
position that the &ldquo;no harm done&rdquo; result is in order, not
just in the case where the flawed existence is (very probably)
<em>unavoidable</em> if the person is ever to exist at all and where,
in that strong sense, the person&rsquo;s coming into existence
&ldquo;depends on&rdquo; agents making the choice under scrutiny, but
also in the case where agents simply retain &ldquo;control&rdquo; over
whether that person comes into existence or not (Heyd 1992, 105 and,
generally, 99&ndash;106; Heyd 2009, 15&ndash;17). According to that
principle, even if the couple has the alternative of bringing the same
child into a better existence &ndash; even if the existence is not
<em>unavoidably</em> flawed &ndash; if the couple also retains the
option of <em>not</em> bringing the child into existence at all, the
choice under scrutiny cannot make things worse for the child. The idea
here would be that, until we actually produce them, &ldquo;we might
decide not to make them the subject of any kind of moral status
whatsoever&rdquo; &ndash; a situation that leaves them, even if they
in point of fact will (if not unavoidably) exist, with &ldquo;no moral
status of any kind, not even a weak one,&rdquo; relative to the choice
under scrutiny (Heyd 1992, 99). </p>

<p>
But the conclusions Boonin reaches in another respect seem to go
beyond Heyd&rsquo;s. Boonin typically describes the choices that give
rise to worth-having existences as simply &ldquo;not morally
wrong&rdquo; (Boonin 2014, 5, 27). But he, unlike Heyd, doesn&rsquo;t
explicitly resist the conceptual idea that choices that are not wrong
are therefore permissible (Boonin 2008, 146&ndash;149; Boonin
2014).</p>

<p>
Not surprisingly, the &ldquo;bite the bullet&rdquo; strategy has
encountered substantial resistance. See, e.g., Parfit 2017,
126&ndash;129. If forced to choose between the person affecting
intuition and the intuition that what the agents have done in the
depletion case or the slave child case is wrong, we may well cling to
the latter. Among other things, it seems highly implausible that our
future-directed conduct should get a moral pass whenever it affects
the timing and manner of conception.</p>

<p>
Of course, as Heyd notes, in many cases a choice that creates a low
wellbeing level for a person whose existence <em>depends</em> on that
choice will also create low wellbeing levels for people whose
existences are <em>independent</em> of that choice. If an agent buries
glass in the wood prior to conceiving a child, then even if that
choice affects the timing and manner of conception and thus (according
to the logic of the nonidentity analysis) cannot make things worse for
the agent&rsquo;s <em>own</em> child, that choice might still make
things worse for a <em>neighbor&rsquo;s</em> child. On that ground,
the choice can be declared wrong (Heyd 1992, 193&ndash;203). The
choice of wrongful life, as well, can make things worse for people
other than the impaired child &ndash; create burdens, in other words,
for those other people that the impaired child itself may then be
required to share (Roberts 2009a).</p>

<p>
Boonin offers another suggestion for making the &ldquo;bite the
bullet&rdquo; strategy more plausible. According to Boonin, our
intuition that the choices under scrutiny &ndash; in, e.g., the
depletion case and the slave child case &ndash; are wrong is itself
rooted in the fact that we have a hard time keeping &ldquo;present
before our mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; what makes the nonidentity cases
&ldquo;atypical&rdquo; and &ldquo;idiosyncratic&rdquo; &ndash; namely,
that in the nonidentity cases low wellbeing levels do not correlate in
the usual way or the way we have come to expect to a person&rsquo;s
having been made worse off (Boonin 2008, 146&ndash;149; Boonin 2014).
We then confuse the atypical case with the ordinary case in which low
wellbeing levels <em>do</em> signify a person&rsquo;s having been made
worse off. We then, mistakenly, see wrongdoing not just in the
ordinary case but in the atypical case as well. Once we appreciate
that confusion, we should find ourselves more comfortable abandoning
the view that a wrong has been done in the atypical case.</p>

<p>
Boonin&rsquo;s deflationist suggestion seems to run counter, however,
to our own lived experience, given that we &ndash; post-Parfit &ndash;
feel strongly that we <em>always</em> have the relevant distinction
clearly in mind but continue to consider the depletion choice wrong.
</p>

<h3 id="ActWronWithMakiThinWorsForAnyExisFutuPersImpeWron">3.2 Purely impersonal views; pluralistic views</h3>

<p>
Philosophers who accept the various nonidentity cases as
counterexamples against the person affecting intuition have the option
of retaining the basic consequentialist framework but shifting from a
<em>person affecting</em> to an approach that is either purely
<em>impersonal</em> or impersonal at least in part. Having thus
rejected the person affecting intuition, their challenge then becomes
to explain how a choice can be wrong, or make the future in which that
choice is made worse, without making things worse for any person who
does or will exist in that future &ndash; <em>without</em> generating
still other population problems that seem at least as challenging as
the nonidentity problem itself. </p>

<h4>3.2.1 Purely impersonal views: The total theory; the average theory; critical level consequentialism</h4>

<p>
Traditional forms of utilitarianism, including both the classic
maximizing form introduced above as the &ldquo;total theory&rdquo; and what we can
call the &ldquo;average theory,&rdquo; are purely impersonal in
nature: they flatly reject the person affecting intuition and, in
addition, have the resources easily to explain how a choice made at a
future can be wrong while making things worse for no one who does or
will exist in that future. If, by waiting a few years to have a child,
the 14-year-girl could have produced a child who is better off but
nonidentical to the child the girl in fact produced, both the total
theory and the average theory, other things equal, imply that what the
girl has done is wrong and makes the future worse (Singer 2011,
107&ndash;119). The key for both views is the position that a
future&rsquo;s value, and thus the permissibility of the choice that
brings about that future, is to be determined on an <em>aggregate</em>
basis: utilities correlating to the individual wellbeing levels for
each person who does or will exist in a given future are added up to
determine the value of that future, with, in the case of the average
view, that sum itself being divided by the number of people who do or
will exist in that future. On both approaches, it is immaterial
whether we create additional (total or average) wellbeing (a) by
creating additional wellbeing for a particular existing or future
person or (b) by bringing a nonidentical but better off person into
existence. (See
 <a href="../consequentialism/">consequentialism</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The nonidentity problem, according to Parfit, seems clearly to
demonstrate that the moral principle we seek &ndash; the &ldquo;Theory
X&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;will not take a person-affecting form&rdquo;
(Parfit 1987, 378). A theory that is impersonal &ndash; at least in
part &ndash; may seem the obvious alternative. The difficulty is that
both the total theory and the average theory give rise to their very
own serious population problems. As noted earlier, the total theory
quickly generates the repugnant conclusion (Parfit 1987, 381&ndash;90;
see also
 <a href="../repugnant-conclusion/">repugnant conclusion</a>).
 The average theory does a good job with the nonidentity problem
<em>and</em> the repugnant conclusion. But the average theory
implausibly prohibits bringing even the very happy child into
existence if it so happens that the people who are already in
existence happen to be even happier (Parfit 1987, 420; Feldman 1995,
192&ndash;93). It also generates highly implausible results when
applied to the case Parfit called &ldquo;Hell Three&rdquo; (Parfit
1987, 422; see also Temkin 2012, 319&ndash;320). Surely, according to
Parfit, a situation that makes life hellish for everyone who does or
will exist is not improved by the addition of still more people whose
lives aren&rsquo;t quite so awful but are still far less than worth
living. The total theory and the average theory both, in addition,
face perennial objections based on considerations of justice, fairness
and equality.</p>

<p>
An attempt to modify the total theory with the aim of avoiding at
least the most extreme forms of the repugnant conclusion comes in the
form of <em>critical level utilitarianism</em> (Broome 2014). Critical
level utilitarianism is impersonal in nature &ndash; it rejects the
person affecting intuition and, as an aggregative, impersonal view,
has the resources to provide a plausible account of the nonidentity
problem. Then, to avoid certain versions of the repugnant conclusion,
it further insists that the life worth living, if it happens to fall
below a certain critical level, will <em>reduce</em>, rather than add
to, the value of the relevant future.</p>

<p>
Critical level utilitarianism struggles, however, in the face of what
Arrhenius called the &ldquo;sadistic conclusion.&rdquo; Thus in
certain cases the theory will instruct that the future that contains
lives that are uniformly worth living and yet fall below the critical
level is <em>worse</em> than the future that contains lives that are
uniformly worse than lives worth living (Arrhenius 2000). That result
seems highly implausible.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Purely impersonal pluralism; radical pluralism; substitutional consequentialism</h4>

<p>
In response to objections against the total theory and the average
theory, theorists more recently have outlined approaches that are, in
one way or another, <em>pluralistic</em> in nature.</p>

<p>
Thus Larry Temkin proposes that what makes a future better or a choice
permissible is determined by reference to the <em>all things
considered</em> good, where the all things considered good is a matter
both of how much aggregate wellbeing a future contains and the extent
to which that future realizes still other ideals or values, including,
for example, fairness, desert, equality, human flourishing and the
prioritization of the needs of the least well-off (Temkin 1993,
221&ndash;27). In contrast, a second approach retains additivity for
the purpose of determining a future&rsquo;s overall value but takes
the position that what is to be added up is indicated not by
individual wellbeing levels but rather by those levels adjusted in
some way to reflect values beyond how much wellbeing a person has in a
given future. See Broome 2015; 1991; Feldman 1997.</p>

<p>
Such forms of pluralism are consistent with the position that value
itself remains purely impersonal in nature. As such, they seem to have
the resources necessary to provide a plausible response to the
nonidentity problem. Moreover, by recognizing values over and above
the value of the maximization of aggregate wellbeing, they may also
have the resources necessary to avoid certain versions of the
repugnant conclusion &ndash; to explain, for example, by reference to
the ideal of human flourishing (Temkin) or the concept of desert
(Feldman) or the concept of the personal good (Broome), how it can be
morally better to produce a somewhat smaller number of extremely well
off people rather than a very large number of people whose lives are
only barely worth living.</p>

<p>
Still other theorists have proposed more radical forms of pluralism:
theories that reflect both person affecting and impersonal values.
Thus Jeff McMahan considers the question whether a couple ought to
produce a third child who would be very happy if he or she were to
exist but whose coming into existence would create significant burdens
for that child&rsquo;s two already-existing siblings. Then, we might
say that the goal of maximizing wellbeing in the <em>aggregate</em>
provides the couple with a reason to have the third child while the
<em>person affecting</em> goal of avoiding burdens on behalf of the
two siblings provides the couple with a reason <em>not</em> to have
the third child. What the couple ought to do is then determined by how
these opposing reasons balance against one another. See McMahan 2006;
2009; see also Temkin 1993, 321&ndash;47; Temkin 2012, 363&ndash;456 (combining an
&ldquo;internal aspects&rdquo; approach and an &ldquo;essentially comparative&rdquo;
approach); Buchanan et al. 2000, 226 and 249 (adopting both principle
&ldquo;M&rdquo; and principle &ldquo;N&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Parfit himself proposed serious consideration of what he called the
&ldquo;wide&rdquo; &ldquo;dual&rdquo; person affecting principle: &ldquo;One of two outcomes
would be in one way better if this outcome would together benefit
people more, and in another way better if this outcome would benefit
each person more.&rdquo; Parfit 2017, 154. According to Parfit,
&ldquo;this Wide Principle would be only one of our beliefs.&rdquo;
Parfit 2017, 157. It is not, on its own, the &ldquo;Theory X&rdquo;
Parfit urged us to seek decades ago. Parfit 1987, 378.</p>

<p>
It is not clear, however, that any of the forms of pluralism (radical
or not) outlined above, as they now stand, make any significant
headway in solving our population problems. The fact is that we are
not in a position to determine whether those theories have the
advantages that may seem to accompany them or not since the theories
themselves have not yet been sufficiently detailed to show how the
(sometimes opposing) values that they recognize are to be balanced
against each other. Without those implications at hand, we cannot test
the theory; and without testing the theory, we cannot determine
whether the theory generates plausible accounts of our problem cases
or not.</p>

<p>
Perhaps in part in search of principles that are more transparent and
thus more easily tested, still other theorists have suggested
principles that require agents to create additional wellbeing,
including by way of bringing a better off person into existence in
place of a nonidentical less well off person, while limiting that
obligation to the case where agents can <em>substitute in</em> the
better off person for the less well off person on a one-to-one basis.
Holtug 2009; 2010, 160&ndash;162; see also Parfit 1987, 369&ndash;71

27&ndash;39 (concept of injury by failure to substitute).</p>

<h3 id="ActWronHarmBadForPersWithMakiPersWorsOff">3.3 Choice wrongs, or harms, or is bad for, person without making person worse off</h3>

<p>
Still other theorists, seeking to retain the person affecting
intuition without giving up the claim that the choices under scrutiny
in the nonidentity cases really are wrong and really do make things
worse and while accepting the phenomenon of the precariousness of
existence, aim to solve the nonidentity problem by taking the position
that the choice that is &ldquo;bad for&rdquo; a person is not necessarily one that
makes things worse for that person or that harms that person, in the
traditional, comparative sense of that term.</p>

<p>
The positions noted in this part 3.3 are reminiscent of an idea that
Kavka explores. Thus Kavka considers the position that, even if the
choices under scrutiny do not make things worse for or harm that
child, they may nonetheless constitute instances in which the agent
has acted (by creating a less &ldquo;intrinsically desirable,&rdquo;
or a &ldquo;restricted,&rdquo; life) &ldquo;wrongly toward&rdquo; the
child (Kavka, 1982, 97 and 104&ndash;105) and thus whose choice itself
is wrong.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Wronging without harming; rights-based accounts; exploitation account</h4>

<p>
Thus, one suggestion has been that what makes the choice under
scrutiny wrong is that it violates the apparent victim&rsquo;s
<em>right against being brought into a flawed existence</em> (Woodward
1986; Elliot 1989; Elliot 1997; Smolkin 1999; Velleman 2008; Cohen
2009). Consider, for example, the slave child case. The nonidentity
analysis has it that the couple&rsquo;s choice to enter into the slave
child contract does not make things worse for the child since that
particular child very probably would never have existed at all in the
absence of that choice. Yet we may agree that everyone has a right not
to be born, or made, a slave. The couple&rsquo;s entering into the
slave child contract and then proceeding to have a child under that
contract thus violates the child&rsquo;s right. On that explicitly
person affecting basis, we can then say that the couple&rsquo;s choice
is wrong.</p>

<p>
Similarly, the ticket agent who refuses to sell an airline ticket to
Smith on the basis of Smith&rsquo;s race violates Smith&rsquo;s right
against racial discrimination even in the case where the plane
subsequently &ldquo;crashes, killing all aboard&rdquo; (Woodward 1986,
810&ndash;11, citing Adams). &ldquo;What makes racial discrimination
wrong is that it is unfair and that it stigmatizes &hellip; and a
choice may have that character &ndash; and be wrong for that reason
&ndash; regardless of how it affects [a person&rsquo;s] other
interests&rdquo; (Woodward 1986, 811). </p>

<p>
Woodward goes so far as to say that the choice that brings a person
into a flawed existence and thereby violates that person&rsquo;s right
&ldquo;harms&rdquo; that person under what he calls a
&ldquo;nonconsequentialist approach&rdquo; to harm (Woodward 1986,
818). Once it is established that the right has been violated,
however, any effort to establish harm as well would seem to be
motivated not by moral but by legal requirements (wrongful life) or
quasi-legal requirements (reparations). For those purposes, however, a
non-comparative account of harm becomes especially controversial. </p>

<p>
The rights-based account does not require that we compile a defined
list of rights. We might take the more general view that each person
has a right to be created with &ldquo;due consideration for his or her
humanity&rdquo;; we can understand that life itself is a
&ldquo;predicament&rdquo; for which one&rsquo;s children need to be
well-equipped (Velleman 2008, 266 and 276). A &ldquo;child has a right
to be born into good enough circumstances, and being born to [e.g.] a
fourteen-year-old mother isn&rsquo;t good enough&rdquo; (Velleman
2008, 275). That a child was &ldquo;glad to be born&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t mean that that child has waived &ldquo;his
birthright&rdquo; (Velleman 2008, 277). More concretely, one might
propose that it is wrong to bring a child into existence when many of
his or her rights as outlined in, e.g., the United Nations Convention,
would be violated (Archard 2004, 403&ndash;20). Still another approach
argues that future people come into existence with certain
&ldquo;claim rights,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;claims&rdquo; (Meyer
2016, 49) that can be defined in part in either sufficientarian (Meyer
and Roser 2009) or egalitarian (Meyer 2016, 52&ndash;58) terms. Agents
who fail to respect those claims fail to discharge a
&ldquo;duty&rdquo; they owe &ldquo;to the person who has the
claim&rdquo; (Meyer 2016, 49).</p>

<p>
Rights-based and claims-based solutions to the nonidentity problem
face certain challenges. The first, from Parfit, is that it is
questionable whether the choice an individual would not
&ldquo;regret&rdquo; and may even applaud can violate a right or
constitute a failure to discharge a duty. If it can, it (arguably)
does so only in some technical way but not in a way supports the claim
that the choice is morally wrong. When respect for the right or claim
can be seen in advance not to promote the interests of the
rights-holder in any way, the better view might be that the right has
been implicitly &ldquo;waived&rdquo; or the violation implicitly
consented to (Parfit 1987, 364&ndash;65 and 373&ndash;74) on behalf of
the future person. By analogy, the right or claim against bodily
injury may be considered waived, or the violation consented to, when
the already existing person arrives at the hospital unconscious and in
immediate need of open heart surgery. We don&rsquo;t think that
whatever technical rights violation there may have been in such a case
supports the inference that what the surgeon has done is morally
&ndash; or indeed legally &ndash; wrong.</p>

<p>
The second objection asks whether a rights-based or claims-based
approach proves too much. Consider the case where a couple is enslaved
and has no means of escaping that status and where any child that the
couple will produce is sure to be born a slave. If producing a child
in Kavka&rsquo;s original slave child case described in part 2 above is
wrong in virtue of the fact that it violates the child&rsquo;s right
or disregards a child&rsquo;s claim, it seems that producing a child in the
revised slave child case must be wrong as well. But that negative
evaluation in the revised case seems implausible. While, in some
sense, a right may have been violated or a claim disregarded, it
remains unclear that the couple&rsquo;s choice is morally wrong. </p>

<p>
An alternate account that has features in common with the rights-based
approach but that, by focusing more closely on the question of whether
future people have been &ldquo;unfair[ly]&rdquo; treated as compared against
existing people and thus &ldquo;<em>wrongfully</em> exploited&rdquo;
(emphasis added), goes some distance in avoiding both objections.
Liberto 2014, 76&ndash;81. See also Kavka 1981, 106&ndash;109. The
idea is that, in cases where the exploitation is established as itself
wrongful, the first objection, based on waiver or consent, fails. The
same idea provides a defense against the second objection. When the
enslaved couple produce a child who is sure to be born a slave, there
seems to be no basis on which to claim that the <em>couple</em> has
wrongfully exploited the child. (Still other agents, in addition to
the broader <em>community</em>, of course, would remain morally
liable.) A question for the exploitation view is whether it can be
extended to address instances of the nonidentity problem in which it
seems clear that a wrong has been done but future people aren&rsquo;t
treated unfairly as compared against existing people. Thus forms of
depletion, e.g, may still be considered wrong and to make things worse
even if existing people gain nothing and even if &ndash; due to
technological developments &ndash; future people are made
substantially better off than existing people. </p>

<p>
A third objection seems invulnerable to the reply based on
exploitation. Narrowly focusing on the rights-based approach, that
objection simply notes that, if the <em>child</em> has the right not
to be brought into an existence of a certain sort, it is plausible
that the child&rsquo;s <em>parents</em> have various rights as well.
Thus, the couple who opts to produce a child with Huntington&rsquo;s
disease or hereditary deafness in place of a relatively unimpaired
child may simply be exercising their rights of procreative liberty.
They may, that is, be using their gametes and their labor, as a matter
of right, in a way that suits them. We quickly see that the
child&rsquo;s rights and the couple&rsquo;s rights cannot both be
respected &ndash; a fact that raises the concern that accounts of the
nonidentity cases based on rights may themselves be rooted in a theory
that is inconsistent (Persson 2009).</p>

<h4>3.3.2 Harming without making person worse off; non-comparative harm; list account of harm; threshold account of harm</h4>

<p>
Many articulations of the nonidentity problem take for granted that a
correct account of harm understands harm as <em>comparative</em> in
nature. On such an account, a choice <em>harms</em> a person only if
that choice makes that person <em>worse off</em> than he or she would
have been under still other choices; a person <i>p</i> is not harmed
at a given future <i>f1</i> if there exists no alternate f2 <i>f2</i>
such that <i>p</i> has more wellbeing at <i>f2</i> than <i>p</i> has
at <i>f1</i>; a choice that <em>maximizes</em> wellbeing for a person
at a future <i>f1</i> cannot <em>harm</em> that person at <i>f1</i>.
At least: it cannot do so in any &ldquo;morally relevant sense&rdquo;
(Parfit 1987, 374). </p>

<p>
Some philosophers have suggested that we also have &ndash; or can
construct &ndash; a second morally relevant concept of harm, one that
is <em>non-comparative</em> in nature. Though narrower in some ways
than the comparative concept, in other ways the non-comparative
concept is broader. Specifically, it can count bringing a person into
an existence that is in some way burdened as <em>harming</em> that
person even in the case where that person&rsquo;s wellbeing has been
maximized. Having established that the choice under scrutiny harms the
person it brings into existence and burdens in some way, we can then
provide a person affecting account of why that choice is wrong and how
it makes things worse.</p>

<p>
Shiffrin uses examples to explain her concept of non-comparative harm
and give credence to the claim that non-comparative harm has moral
relevance. Thus she argues that, if you are hit on the head by a gold
bar dropped from the sky as a gift to you, you have been
<em>harmed</em> even if you have been more than compensated for that
harm in virtue of the fact that you are now own a gold bar (Shiffrin
1999, 120&ndash;135).</p>

<p>
In the wrongful life case, a child is born with a serious genetic or
chromosomal impairment, an impairment that is unavoidable if the child
is to exist at all. On a comparative account of harm, bringing that
child into existence does not harm that child (provided the existence
is not less than worth having). Elizabeth Harman points out, however,
that it&rsquo;s indisputable that bringing that child into existence
<em>does</em> cause the child to experience &ldquo;pain, mental or
physical discomfort, disease, deformity, disability, or death&rdquo;;
more generally, it produces a state that is bad for the child to be in
&ndash; a &ldquo;bad state.&rdquo; (Harman 2009, 139). On
Harman&rsquo;s view, that a choice imposes any of the listed
conditions on the child is sufficient to establish that that choice
<em>harms</em> the child whether or not the child has been made worse
off (Harman 2004, 92&ndash;93 and 107; Harman 2009, 139). It would be
hard to argue, moreover, that harm in that form has no moral
relevance. Thus, even those who think that wrongful life doesn&rsquo;t
involve harm &ndash; harm, that is, in the comparative, worse off
sense of that term &ndash; agree that any pain and suffering
experienced by the child must be taken into account in order to
determine that the child&rsquo;s existence is not less than worth
having. (In the rare case in which the child&rsquo;s existence
<em>is</em> less than worth having &ndash; in which, that is, the
child would have been better off never existing at all &ndash; we
would say that the child sustains both comparative <em>and</em>
non-comparative harm.) </p>

<p>
A related proposal that avoids the difficulties of tethering
non-comparative harm to any particular list of burdensome conditions
makes use of the concept of a <em>threshold-dependent</em> concept of
harm (Rivera-Lopez 2009, 342; see also Meyer, 2004). On this view,
bringing a child into existence when that child&rsquo;s wellbeing level
falls below &ldquo;some normal threshold of quality of life&rdquo;
counts as <em>harming</em> that child even if that existence is itself
worth having (Rivera-Lopez 2009, 337). </p>

<p>
Objections to proposals that rely on non-comparative concepts of harm
to solve the nonidentity problem focus on whether that concept itself
can be clearly worked out. Thus, it may be hard to see how one whose
wellbeing has been <em>maximized</em> can at the same time have been
<em>harmed</em> in any sense of that term that remains clearly within
our grasp. Moreover, as Parfit suggests, even if we think it correct
on occasion to say that a person who has not been made worse off has
been &ldquo;harmed,&rdquo; we may still be unclear whether that person
has been harmed in a &ldquo;morally relevant sense&rdquo; (Parfit
1987, 374). Finally, there is the question of limits: what burdensome
conditions are to appear on the non-comparative harm list? What is the
threshold level below which existence counts as harm? What is
&ldquo;normal&rdquo;? And are we really willing to eliminate or at
least to mix up the distinction we think we now can so cleanly draw
between, e.g., the case in which opening up one&rsquo;s chest to
expose the heart serves no purpose at all and the case in which
opening up one&rsquo;s chest to expose the heart is an essential part
of an open-heart procedure that is itself both necessary and
sufficient to restore life and health? For critical discussion of the
non-comparative account of harm, see Gardner 2015.</p>

<p>
A strategy that avoids disputes surrounding the concept of harm would
be to argue that, even if the choice does not <em>harm</em> the child,
the fact that it causes the child to suffer may mean that it
nonetheless <em>wrongs</em> the child. Bonnie Steinbock thus
recognizes how hard it is to establish that the child brought into the
unavoidably flawed existence has been genuinely harmed (Steinbock
2009, 157&ndash;158). But she argues that we still have room to insist
that such a child has been treated unfairly or has been wronged in
cases in which the child&rsquo;s existence fails to meet or exceed a
certain &ldquo;decent minimum,&rdquo; which is itself achieved
&ldquo;only if life holds a reasonable promise of containing the
things that make human lives good,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;an ability to
experience pleasure, to learn, to have relationships with
others&rdquo; (Steinbock 2009, 163&ndash;165). Another approach would
be to draw the line at average wellbeing (for discussion, see Rachels
1998; Tooley 1998). Still another approach would be to focus on
whether the child will face unusual or severe hardships (Benatar 2000;
Kamm 2002).</p>

<p>
An underlying assumption of each of the approaches sketched in this
part 3.3.2 is that the questionable choice is properly considered to
<em>cause</em> the serious hardship that initially gives rise to our
concern. Arguably, in some nonidentity cases the choice does stand in
the appropriate causal relation to the relevant hardship, and in other
nonidentity cases it does not (Hanser 2009). While Hanser puts the
point in terms of harm, it could be extended to the notion of wronging
without harming that Steinbock suggests. See also Gardner 2015,
2017.</p>

<h3 id="NoniProbRootConf">3.4 Nonidentity problem rooted in conceptual or metaphysical mistakes regarding personal identity</h3>

<h4>3.4.1 Reexamining assumptions regarding the nature of personal identity and what it is to make &ldquo;a person&rdquo; worse off</h4>

<p>
The several proposals fall under this heading seek to retain the
person affecting intuition and the claim that the choices under
scrutiny really are wrong and really do make things worse. But they
question some of the ancillary conceptual or metaphysical claims
grounding the claim that the coming into existence of any given person
is highly precarious. Proposal (a) below accepts that the future
person <em>p</em> is nonidentical to the person <em>q</em> conceived
from distinct gametes and then exploits the fact that <em>p</em> and
<em>q</em> may fall under the same description; proposal (b) argues
<em>p</em> and <em>q</em> may be identical despite a distinction in
gametes (despite, that is, a distinction in the timing and manner of
conception); proposal (c) argues, on metaphysical grounds, that the
nonidentity problem rests on a certain equivocation in the use of the
term &ldquo;person&rdquo;; proposal (d) exploits certain predictable
mistakes many people will make in thinking about the identity between
<em>p</em> and <em>q</em>; and proposal (e) explores a possible
equivocation on what it is to make a person &ldquo;worse off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
(a) Though Parfit briefly discusses and sets aside the descriptive
proposal (Parfit 1987, 359&ndash;60), interest in that proposal has
been renewed in recent years (Hare 2007, 512&ndash;23, advocating a
concept of &ldquo;de dicto&rdquo; harm; Reiman 2007, 78&ndash;90,
describing a &ldquo;veil of ignorance&rdquo; with respect to the
identity of the person harmed; Wolf 2009; R&auml;s&auml;nen 2023). The
proposal makes use of the fact that the same definite description can
pick out distinct children in distinct scenarios. Consider the slave
child case. Let <em>p</em> be the child who in fact exists and suffers
as a result of the couple&rsquo;s entering into the slave child
contract. And let <em>q</em> be any one of the children who might have
existed had the couple not entered into the slave child contract yet
still produced a child. The nonidentity problem argues (among other
things) that <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are, at least very probably,
numerically distinct, that is, nonidentical. At the same time, on one
construction, <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, even if nonidentical, fall
under a common description: they are equally, for example, &ldquo;the
child produced by the couple.&rdquo; Moreover, since one choice makes
<em>p</em> worse off than the other choice makes <em>q</em>, the one
choice, on a certain construction, makes &ldquo;the child produced by
the couple&rdquo; worse off than the other choice makes &ldquo;the
child produced by the couple.&rdquo; And on that basis we can then say
that the one choice makes things (&ldquo;de dicto&rdquo;) worse for
&ldquo;the child produced by the couple&rdquo; than the other choice
does.</p>

<p>
(b) A second proposal challenges the metaphysical claims about
cross-world identity that are inherent in the nonidentity problem. On
this proposal, the child <em>p</em> produced as a slave when the
couple chooses to enter into the slave child contract and the child
<em>q</em> produced as a non-slave when the couple refrains from
entering into the contract but still produces a child should not
necessarily be considered distinct. <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> may, in
other words, be <em>the very same child</em> despite the fact that
(due to variations in the timing and manner of their conceptions) they
have ended up with distinct genomes.</p>

<p>
(c) Still another proposal rejects theories of personal identity that
reflect a rigid form of essentialism and instead posits that there
exist &ldquo;many entities in the vicinity of&rdquo; the child who
eventually comes into existence in the various nonidentity cases and
is the subject of our person affecting concern. If we accept both the
person affecting idea that a choice is wrong only if it is bad for a
particular person &ndash; a person who does or will exist &ndash; and
the idea that a choice is bad for a person only if that person
&ldquo;would have existed&rdquo; had an alternate choice been made, we
are, without realizing it, focusing on distinct entities, with one
claim holding of one entity and the other claim holding of another.
Dasgupta 2018, 541&ndash;542; 550&ndash;554. For a proposal that
similarly rejects a strict form of the origins (genetic) account of
personal identity in favor of a Lewisian
&ldquo;counterpart-theoretic&rdquo; approach for the purpose of
solving the nonidentity problem and specifically aims to retain the
cogency of certain harm claims in that context, see Wrigley 2012. An
account that also appeals to counterpart theory with the aim of
resolving not just the nonidentity problem but the full range of
population problems can be found in Meacham 2012. For a more general
discussion, see Cooper 2015.</p>

<p>
(d) A form of rule consequentialism, rather than struggling to avoid
mistaken assumptions, simply exploits two na&iuml;ve mistakes that
many people may well make when they first begin to think about their
obligations in respect of future people. The first is the mistake of
thinking that the population produced when, for example, agents choose
conservation will be identical to the population produced when agents
instead choose depletion. The second is the person affecting intuition
itself &ndash; the idea that a choice made at a future that makes
things worse for no person who does or will exist in that future
cannot be wrong. Tim Mulgan suggests that the &ldquo;ideal code&rdquo;
&ndash; the code whose internalization by most of a given society will
maximize wellbeing on an aggregate basis &ndash; will incorporate and
in effect deem correct both those mistakes. They are both, after all,
easily and efficiently &ldquo;taught&rdquo; since (Mulgan thinks) we
are prone to make them in any case and they in effect cancel each
other out. Because the ideal code is violated by the depletion choice
and the 14-year-old girl&rsquo;s choice to have a child, both are
declared wrong (Mulgan 2006, 155&ndash;56 and 204; Mulgan 2009).</p>

<p>
(e) Cases involving causal preemption seem to show that the simple
counterfactual (&ldquo;but for&rdquo;) account of what it is to make
things worse for a person &ndash; a choice is worse for a person only
if it makes that person &ldquo;worse off than [that person] would
otherwise be&rdquo; &ndash; fails (Bontly 2016, 1236). For the
premises of the nonidentity problem themselves, then, to remain
plausible, we must understand what it is for a choice to be
&ldquo;worse for&rdquo; a person in another way. Bontly suggests the
following principle: a choice is worse for someone if and only if it
&ldquo;affects that person for the worse,&rdquo; where it is
understood that a choice that has an &ldquo;effect&rdquo; on a person
that is itself adverse in some way is sufficient to show that the
choice &ldquo;affects that person for the worse&rdquo; (Bontly 2016,
1237&ndash;38). We then suspect an equivocation when we realize that
we can&rsquo;t both hold that understanding of what it is for a choice
to be &ldquo;worse for&rdquo; a person constant and at the same time
ensure that still other premises of the nonidentity argument remain
plausible. Specifically: while the claim that a choice is not worse
for a person <em>if</em> (sufficient condition) that person has a life
worth living and &ldquo;would never exist had [that] choice not been
made&rdquo; seems plausible, the claim that that choice does not
&ldquo;affect [that person] for the worse&rdquo; given those same
conditions &ldquo;seems rather more dubious&rdquo; (Bontly 2016,
1238&ndash;1241).</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Is there an explanatory gap?</h4>

<p>
An ongoing controversy raised by the proposals described in part 3.4.1
above is whether they successfully explain the wrongness of the wrong
choice in terms of the adverse consequences that choice has <em>for
the person whose plight has drawn our concern to begin with</em>.</p>

<p>
Parfit&rsquo;s own concerns about proposal (a) &ndash; to take one
example &ndash; are based on the apparent explanatory gap between the
claim that the couple&rsquo;s choice makes things worse for &ldquo;the
child produced by the couple&rdquo; and the result we seek to explain
&ndash; that the choice to enter into the contract is wrong. The
question is whether there is anything we can grasp in what the couple
has done <em>to the child in fact produced</em> that explains
<em>why</em> the couple&rsquo;s choice is wrong. No &ldquo;familiar
moral principle&rdquo; takes us from the shorthand claim to the
assessment we are aiming to explain (Parfit 1987, 359; Wasserman 2008,
529&ndash;35; for discussion, see Weinberg 2008.)</p>

<p>
More generally, do the proposals in (a) &ndash; (e) either (i) trace the
wrongness of the wrong choice to something other than what is bad for
that particular person or (ii) ask us, without adequate justification,
to abandon the handful of clear intuitions that we do seem to have
regarding personal identity? (i) Do they retain the person affecting
intuition in a sufficiently robust form? Or are they <em>person
affecting</em> in name only and in fact root their explanation of
wrongness not in what is bad <em>for the person</em> but rather in
what is bad <em>for the world</em>? (ii) Do they ask us to
<em>concede</em> that <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are one and the same
person in cases where we really can&rsquo;t bring ourselves to
<em>believe</em> that <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are one and the same
person? Could my father&rsquo;s first-born child have been <em>me</em>
had he never met my mother at all and instead produced a very
different child with a very different genome born at a very different
time? We should agree we can figure out a theory that generates such a
claim of identity. What is unclear is the justification that compels
us to accept that theory.</p>

<p>
If we <em>both</em> confine our scrutiny to what has been done to the
particular child <em>and</em> insist on retaining some of our clearest
intuitions regarding personal identity, a second concern arises. As
David Wasserman notes, if the child&rsquo;s life is itself, though
flawed, worth living and if that flaw is unavoidable if that
particular child is ever to exist at all, it may seem that any
difficulty the child then faces is a &ldquo;perfectly acceptable price
to pay for a life he [or she] could not have without it&rdquo;
(Wasserman 2006, 145). We again are left with the kind of explanatory
gap that Parfit noted in connection with the descriptive view.
Confining our scrutiny just to what has been done to the child and
properly taking into account the good that has been done for the child
as well as the bad, we cannot discern why what has been done is, by
any stretch, bad for the child and hence cannot discern any person
affecting ground for the claim that what has been done is wrong.</p>

<h3 id="NoniProbRootMistCalcReleProb">3.5 Nonidentity problem rooted in a mistake in reasoning about relevant probabilities</h3>

<p>
The nonidentity cases that seem most seriously to challenge the person
affecting intuition rely on claims about probabilities. Thus in the
slave child case, the depletion case, cases involving historical
injustices and many others, it is claimed only that &ldquo;very probably&rdquo;
particular people would not have existed had agents chosen
differently. Closer scrutiny of the probabilities at stake in those
cases suggests a solution to the problem that allows us to retain the
person affecting intuition while recognizing the phenomenon of the
precariousness of existence and accepting the conceptual and
metaphysical assumptions other proposals seek to challenge. What that
closer scrutiny shows is that the conclusion that the future person
who is the subject of our concern has not been made worse off, or
harmed (in the traditional, comparative sense of that term), by the
choice under scrutiny is not one that we can validly reach. Once we
recognize the fallacy in the argument, we can identify a basis for an
account that recognizes that the choice under scrutiny, after all,
makes things worse for, and harms, that person (Roberts 2024, 196&ndash;204;
see also Roberts 1998; 2003; 2006; 2009; Roberts and Wasserman
2017).</p>

<p>
The probability-based proposal is based on the following formulation
of the person affecting intuition: a choice made at a given future
<em>f1</em> is morally wrong, and makes <em>f1</em> worse than a
second future <em>f2</em>, only if there exists an alternate
practically accessible future <em>f3</em> such that <em>f1</em> is
worse for at least one person who does or will exist in <em>f1</em>
than <em>f3</em>, where <em>f3</em> may, but need not, be identical to
<em>f2</em>. To this basic formulation is then added a further
necessary condition, a <em>probability-based</em> condition, on when a
choice is wrong (Roberts 2024, chap. 6).</p>

<p>
That formulation of the intuition, like the initial formulations set
forth in the preamble and part 1, is cautious. It provides only a
necessary condition for when one future is worse than another and when
a choice at that one future is wrong; and the necessary condition it
provides is a condition only on when one future is worse (not better)
than another. Also like those initial formulations, it is consistent
with the position that all people, including the merely possible, have
the same moral status. In contrast to those initial formulations,
however, the formulation is explicit in nailing down a critical point:
in determining whether a person has been made worse off in a given
future, the formulation requires an inquiry not just into how well off
the future person &ldquo;would have been,&rdquo; but also into how
well off that person practically (not logically) &ldquo;could have
been,&rdquo; had an alternate choice been made. (In addition to giving
support to the probability-based proposal, specifically to the first
point noted below, such an expansive test also helps to avoid Broome&rsquo;s
argument against the neutrality intuition (see part 1 above) as well
as issues that arise from simple, counterfactual &ldquo;but for&rdquo;
accounts of when a person is made worse off or has been harmed. (The
&ldquo;but for&rdquo; account of harm has been &ndash; it seems correctly &ndash;
widely rejected, including in the 1930s by the <em>First Restatement
of Torts</em>. See Bontly 2016; Carlson 2018; Roberts 2024, 4&ndash;5
n.8, 19, 57&ndash;58, 196&ndash;97 n.20, 223; see also Roberts 2007; 2009;
2011. For a defense of versions of the counterfactual approach, see
Klocksiem 2012; Bavli 2018.)</p>

<p>
The probability-based proposal then makes two points. First, where it
is stipulated as part of the case that the agents&rsquo; original, wrong
choice has, at a particular future, triggered a chain of events that
resulted in a particular child&rsquo;s &ndash; say, Harry&rsquo;s
&ndash; coming into an existence at that future that is burdened by a
particular condition, on close inspection we can see that agents in
that same case also had an alternate choice at an alternate future
that would have triggered an alternate chain of events that would have
resulted in that <em>same</em> child Harry&rsquo;s coming into
existence at that alternate future but now unburdened by that
condition. Agents, in other words, prior to choice had <em>some</em>
way, if not a way they themselves were in a position to identify, to
make things better for Harry. (Thus nothing, for example, in the laws
of physics bars the agents in the slave child case from
<em>declining</em> to enter into the slave child contract and still
adhering to the same timing and manner for conception that they in
fact adhered to. Had they done so, Harry would have existed &ndash;
but as a non-slave.)</p>

<p>
That point leaves unanswered a critical question: even if Harry
practically <em>could</em> have existed under an alternate,
permissible choice, how <em>likely</em> is it that he would have
existed under such a choice?</p>

<p>
It is in fashioning an answer to that critical question that the
second point becomes relevant. Many theorists accept that the role
that probabilities play in evaluating choice can be best explained by
reference to a standard form of <em>expected value theory</em>. (It
should be recognized that standard expected value theory has become
increasingly controversial. For purposes here, however, whether
reference is made to standard expected value theory or instead to an
improved successor view is immaterial.) So that agents can evaluate
their available alternatives <em>prior</em> to choice, the expected
value calculation must itself be completed as of the moment just prior
to choice based on information available to the agents at that moment.
We agree that under any alternate, permissible choice (e.g., the
couple&rsquo;s choice not to enter the slave child contract and yet still
produce a child) <em>Harry&rsquo;s</em> chances of existence would have been
very, very small. What has been missed is that, under the agents&rsquo;
original, wrong choice, <em>Harry&rsquo;s</em> chances of existence,
calculated as of the moment just prior to choice and limited just to
information available to the agents at that moment, were also very,
very small. (How could agents have guessed, prior to choice,
<em>precisely</em> when and how would conceive a child? To the extent
they had any rough idea at all when and how they might accomplish that
feat, they could have allowed themselves to be guided by that rough
idea under an alternate, permissible choice as well.)</p>

<p>
The probabilities under the original, wrong choice and under various
alternate, permissible choices are, in other words, a
&ldquo;wash.&rdquo; But the wellbeing that would have been created for
Harry under any alternate, permissible choice made within the context
of any future that includes Harry and that (against all odds) happens
to unfold is clearly greater than the wellbeing created for Harry
under the original, wrong choice within the context of the future that
(against all odds) happened to unfold. The upshot under standard
expected value theory is that the expected value for Harry under
various alternate, permissible choices is greater than the expected
value for Harry under the original, wrong choice. Thus the door is
open to an account that both accepts the person affecting intuition
but can at the same time explain just why the couple&rsquo;s choice to enter
into the slave child contract and produce a child under the terms of
that contract makes things morally worse and is morally wrong: the
wrong choice made things worse for a child, Harry, who does or will
exist at the future in which he exists under that wrong choice. See
Roberts 2022a, 2022b; and 2024, 196&ndash;204. For criticism of the proposal
outlined here, see Greene 2016; Smilansky 2017; Harney 2019.</p>

<p>
One might object that in fact there is <em>no</em> probability Harry
would exist in the absence of the couple&rsquo;s choosing to enter
into the contract and produce a child since, &ldquo;but for&rdquo;
their entering into the contract, the probability that the couple
would together have produced any child at all is zero. That may be an
accurate prediction of what the couple <em>would</em> have done, but
it doesn&rsquo;t bear on whether Harry has been made worse off or
harmed by what they <em>in fact</em> have done. (As noted above, the
simple, counterfactual, &ldquo;but for,&rdquo; account of when a
person has been made worse off, or harmed, has been widely
rejected.)</p>

<p>
As to those nonidentity cases that seem not to rely on assessments of
the relevant probabilities &ndash; including cases in which the
existence is worth having but <em>unavoidably</em> flawed due, e.g.,
to a genetic or chromosomal disorder &ndash; consistent with the
probability-based proposal we may take the position that those cases
are less worrisome in the sense that it may seem less clear to us that
the choices under scrutiny are wrong or make things morally worse
(Roberts and Wasserman, 2017).</p>

<h3 id="ActWronVirtAgenReasAttiInte">3.6 Choice is wrong in virtue of agent&rsquo;s reasons, attitudes and intentions</h3>

<h4>3.6.1 Choice violates principle of mutual respect</h4>

<p>
A contractualist approach to the nonidentity problem will focus on the
legitimate expectations future people have in respect of the agents
whose choices cause those future people both to exist and suffer. Such
expectations can be violated &ndash; and future people wronged &ndash;
even in cases where those people have not been made worse off, or
harmed, by what the agent has done. What is important is not the
outcome for the person but rather the &ldquo;culpable failure&rdquo;
on the part of the agent, including the failure to respect a future
person&rsquo;s &ldquo;value as capable of rational
self-governance&rdquo; by way of failing to take
&ldquo;risk-managing&rdquo; measures (including, e.g, pre-conception
genetic testing) on behalf of that future person (Kumar 2003,
104&ndash;114; Kumar 2018). An issue that immediately arises is
whether a measure that makes it the case that the person who will
suffer can never exist at all is genuinely risk-managing <em>in
respect of that person</em>. Drawing from Scanlon 1998, Kumar
describes an alternative position that focuses, not on particular
people, but rather on <em>types</em> of persons, or
<em>standpoints</em>, and, specifically, &ldquo;the reasons that
persons in certain circumstances &hellip; typically have for caring
about or wanting certain things.&rdquo; Principles reflected in such
reasons &ndash; principles &ldquo;no one can reasonably reject&rdquo;
&ndash; include preferences against the risk of living a life that is
seriously compromised. Failing to take such reasons into account
(depending on other facts) is counted as a <em>wrong</em> against
(though not a <em>harm</em> to) any particular person who eventually
exists and, as a result of the choice under scrutiny, suffers. Kumar
2018. Left unclear is how to reconcile the <em>standpoint</em> against
the <em>personal</em> risk. A future standpoint may include the
&ldquo;generic&rdquo; preference not to suffer the side effects of a
particular infertility treatment. But if that treatment is necessary
for the person ever to exist at all, it is arguable whether that the
treatment wrongs that person or not. </p>

<p>
Finneron-Burns offers an alternative account of how Scanlon&rsquo;s
contractualism can be applied to solve the nonidentity problem. In
contrast to Kumar&rsquo;s account, Finneron-Burns&rsquo; account avoids phrasing
the debate in terms of types or standpoints that need not be tied to
any particular individual. It instead asserts that we can think about
future people &ndash; people who will in fact one day exist &ndash; in
the same terms we think about existing people while also taking the
position that <em>merely</em> &ldquo;possible people are not included
in the scope of those to whom we owe justification&rdquo;
(Finneron-Burns 2016, 1163; 2024). The upshot is that Finneron-Burns&rsquo;
account would seem to face the same hurdles as will any other view
that claims that people who do or will in fact exist have a special
moral status that the merely possible lack. See part 1 above; part 4
below. </p>

<h4>3.6.2 Agent fails to have appropriate concern for future person&rsquo;s plight</h4>

<p>
A second approach that shifts the analysis of wrongdoing away from
what has been done to the future person and toward facts about the
agent focuses on the agent&rsquo;s reasons for making one choice
rather than another. On this approach, attitudes themselves can be
&ldquo;morally defective&rdquo; (Kahane 2008, 203; see also Noggle
2019 (wrongdoing based on defective attitude toward morality; Bramble
2021 (wrongdoing based on morally dubious character trait)). Whether
the agent&rsquo;s choice wrongs the future person will depend on
whether the agent is motivated by an appropriate level of concern for
the needs and interests of (among others) the future person. Is the
agent appropriately sensitive both to the degree of suffering that
person can be expected to endure and to the various aspects of that
person&rsquo;s life that can be expected to render that life (on
balance) worth living (Wasserman 2006, 146)? The parent may have a
principled objection against pre-implantation genetic diagnosis but
also have an appropriate level of concern for the child&rsquo;s
plight. In that case, the parent&rsquo;s producing the impaired child
in place of the better-off but nonidentical child does not wrong the
impaired child. On the other hand, if a parent never considers the
challenges that the child might face as a result of being born
impaired, then what the parent has done is wrong. Thus, on this view,
the choice&rsquo;s permissibility is a function not of the expected
good for the child in fact being counterbalanced by the expected bad
but rather of the parent&rsquo;s careful determination of how the one
balances against the other (Wasserman 2006, 146&ndash;151). An
implication of this view is that there need be nothing wrong in
choosing to have a less happy rather than a happier child.</p>

<p>
Choices by policymakers (in, e.g., the context of the depletion
example) can be similarly evaluated. The parent&rsquo;s and the
policymaker&rsquo;s roles may differ in respect of the future people
their choices will cause to exist but agents in both roles can
plausibly be held to a role-appropriate standard of concern (Wasserman
2009).</p>

<h2 id="FurtChalPersBaseIntu">4. Related challenge to the person affecting intuition: the asymmetry</h2>

<p>
Part of the reason the person affecting intuition has been so
attractive is the support that it provides to one half of a pair of
highly intuitive claims that McMahan calls <em>the asymmetry</em>
(McMahan 1981; 2009). According to the asymmetry, it is wrong, and
makes a future morally worse, to bring a <em>miserable</em> child
&ndash; a child whose life is <em>less</em> than worth living &ndash;
into existence but it is perfectly permissible, and does not make a
future worse, to leave the <em>happy</em> child out of existence. That
latter of those two claims is simply an implication of the person
affecting intuition.</p>

<p>
Narveson was an early advocate of both the person affecting intuition
and the asymmetry. The asymmetry, however, has recently put forward
not as an adjunct to the person affecting intuition but as still
another way to undermine the intuition (Singer 2011, 88&ndash;89);
MacAskill 2022, 172; see also McMahan 1981, 2009). The objection is
just this: the asymmetry is itself internally inconsistent. Since it
is generally agreed that the choice to bring the miserable child into
existence is, other things equal, surely wrong and makes the future
morally worse, any internal inconsistency within the asymmetry must be
laid at the feet of the person affecting intuition itself.</p>

<p>
Consistency concerns regarding the asymmetry arise when attempts are
made to explain how it can be that the existence of the miserable
child makes things <em>worse</em> but the existence of the happy child
does <em>not</em> make things <em>better</em>. Other objections arise
when attempts are made to avoid inconsistency by situating the
asymmetry within the context of <em>moral actualism</em> or indeed any
theory that assigns a special moral status to actual people (or to
people who will exist if agents make the choice under scrutiny; or to
people who will exist independently of whether agents make that
choice) that it does not also assign to merely possible people (or to
never existing people; or to people whose existence depends on whether
that choice is made). See McMahan 1981; 2009; Persson 2009; Singer
2011, 114; Parfit 2011 vol. 2, 224&ndash;225; see also cases involving
cycling, e.g., Parfit&rsquo;s Tom, Dick and Harry case; Parfit 2017,
140&ndash;146; see also Hare 2007, 503&ndash;507.</p>

<p>
Claims of an internal inconsistency, however, have been challenged. We
can recognize the importance of avoiding the claim that any
person&rsquo;s <em>moral</em> status is a function of that
person&rsquo;s <em>existential</em> status, concede that leaving the
happy child out of existence makes that child worse off than that
child might have been and still insist that a child&rsquo;s being made
worse off by way of being left out of existence altogether lacks any
moral significance even though the child&rsquo;s being made worse off
by way of being brought into a miserable existence has full moral
significance. The distinction that is at work in making that claim
would just be this: the happy child&rsquo;s loss of wellbeing obtains within
a future in which that child never exists at all, while the miserable
child&rsquo;s loss of wellbeing obtains within a future in which that child
does or will exist. See Roberts 2010; 2011a; 2011b; 2024,
53&ndash;65.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Conclusion">5.Conclusion</h2> Perhaps the most practically important contribution the
nonidentity problem has made to our moral theorizing (whether as
philosophers, economists, lawyers or otherwise) is that it focuses our
close attention on the precise nature of the obligations we have in
respect of possible future people, including future generations. If
the person affecting intuition means that &ndash; given the
precariousness of existence &ndash; our obligations are satisfied with
implausible ease, then the nonidentity problem provides us with a
compelling objection <em>against</em> that intuition. If rejecting
that intuition means that we are obligated, not just to <em>make
people happy</em>, but also to <em>make happy people</em> and to do so
even at a grave cost to still other people, then we seem to have a
compelling argument in <em>favor</em> of that intuition. The reason
the nonidentity problem is of such intense and continuing interest is
that neither of those options seems even remotely plausible. The
solution perhaps will involve a closer look at the intuition itself
alongside the various ancillary claims that we must accept in order
validly to argue for either one of those disturbing results.
