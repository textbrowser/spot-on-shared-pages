Things are sometimes said to be incommensurable. The meaning of the
term can take many different interpretations. Central to all
interpretations, however, is the difficulty of making comparisons,
often raising profound questions about practical reason and rational
choice. This entry explores these interpretations, examines common
theories on what it means for two things to be incommensurable with

incommensurability</p>

<h2 id="MeasComp">1. Measurement and Comparison</h2>

<p>
Much of life involves making comparisons as we weigh the merits of the
options available to us. These choices can seem trivial, like deciding
between cereal or oatmeal for breakfast, or they can be more
significant, like choosing whether to study law or philosophy. Often,
we can identify the best option for us. But sometimes, making a
comparison feels impossible, as neither option seems to be better,
worse or equally good as the other. This difficulty of determining how
the options relate can be due to the fact that the options are
incommensurable.</p>

<p>
In this case, it is the options that are incommensurable. The
phenomenon can more generally be said to hold between particular
bearers of value where &ldquo;bearer of value&rdquo; is to be
understood broadly and can include things such as objects of potential
choice (such as a career) or states of affairs that cannot be chosen
(such as a beautiful sunset). Such bearers of value are valuable in
virtue of the abstract value or values they instantiate or
display.</p>

<p>
While it&rsquo;s clear that value incommensurability can complicate
everyday decision-making, it also presents a theoretical challenge for
normative theories that assume options and values can be readily
compared and ranked. What remains less clear, however, is how we
should understand incommensurability. The term has been used to
describe different phenomena, each with various explanations. This
first section will provide an overview of how &ldquo;value
incommensurability&rdquo; has been interpreted.</p>

<h3 id="ManyMeanInco">1.1 The Many Meanings of &ldquo;Incommensurable&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
The term &ldquo;incommensurable&rdquo; suggests a lack of common
measure. In philosophical discussions, it more specifically refers to
the absence of either a cardinal scale or an ordinal scale by which we
can compare the values of two value bearers. Some authors reserve the
term &ldquo;incommensurable&rdquo; for comparisons that can be made
ordinally, but not cardinally (Stocker 1980, 176; Stocker 1997, 203;
Chang 1997, 2). That is, to some, oatmeal may be clearly better than
cereal for breakfast, but it is impossible to say how much better.</p>

<p>
Others offer a more demanding definition of the term. They do not
consider the absence of a cardinal scale sufficient; for
incommensurability to hold, even an ordinal comparison or ranking must
be impossible (e.g., Raz 1986; Rabinowicz 2021a). On this
interpretation, incommensurability refers to the relationship between
two items when neither is better than the other, nor are they equally
good.</p>

<p>
Some prefer a definition of incommensurability in which two value
bearers are considered incommensurable if their relationship can only
be described in negative terms&mdash;that is, no positive value
relation holds between them. This definition depends on the notion
&ldquo;positive value relation&rdquo; which lacks a clear definition
but is believed to be intuitively understandable. Traditionally, it is
assumed that there are three such relations: betterness, worseness,
and equality. If this traditional view is correct, this definition
aligns extensionally with the interpretation mentioned above. However,
if additional positive value relations are acknowledged, as some argue
they should be, the two interpretations diverge. This possibility will
be discussed in Section 2. Both definitions, however, explain why it
is difficult, and even impossible, to determine whether cereal is
better, worse, or equally as good as oatmeal for breakfast, given
their incommensurability.</p>

<p>
Others have not given an exact definition of the term, but use it as
an inclusive umbrella term for comparability problems in general. This
inclusive interpretation has the advantage of encompassing a field of
diverse philosophical discussions that engage in problems concerning
value comparisons. However, this inclusiveness comes at the cost of
precision. James Griffin, for example, gives two examples of what he
labels incommensurability. One involves what he calls
&ldquo;trumping.&rdquo; In a conflict between values <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>, <em>A</em> is said to trump <em>B</em> if
&ldquo;<em>any</em> amount of <em>A</em>, no matter how small, is more
valuable than <em>any</em> amount of <em>B</em>, no matter how
large&rdquo; (Griffin 1986, 83). A weaker form of value
incommensurability involves what Griffin calls
&ldquo;discontinuity.&rdquo; Two values, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>,
are incommensurable in this sense if &ldquo;so long as we have enough
of <em>B</em> any amount of <em>A</em> outranks any further amount of
<em>B</em>; or that enough of <em>A</em> outranks any amount of
<em>B</em>&rdquo; (Griffin 1986, 85). These suggested forms of
incommensurability are, however, compatible with <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em> being cardinally measurable. For example, in the case of
&ldquo;discontinuity,&rdquo; if some amount of <em>A</em> is better
than any amount of <em>B</em>, this superiority might still be
measurable with a precise cardinal value. The fact that additional
instances of <em>B</em> do not change the ordinal ranking of
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> does not entail that the evaluative
difference between them cannot be expressed cardinally. This, and
other forms of incommensurability compatible with cardinal rankings,
will not be discussed further in this entry.</p>

<p>
To complicate matters further, not only is the notion of value
incommensurability used differently by philosophers, but the term
<em>value incomparability</em> is also common in the literature, with
no clear consensus on its meaning. Some authors use the terms
&ldquo;incommensurability&rdquo; and &ldquo;incomparability&rdquo;
interchangeably (e.g., Raz 1986). Others use them to refer to distinct
concepts (e.g., Chang 1997).</p>

<p>
In this entry, the term &ldquo;incomparable&rdquo; will refer to cases
where no positive value relation exists between two value bearers
(Chang 1997). The term &ldquo;incommensurable&rdquo; will refer to the
cases where neither value bearer is better than the other nor are they
equally as good. As mentioned above, if the standard three value
relations fully exhaust the space of possible value relations the two
terms will point to the same examples, but, as will be discussed in
Section 2, we shall not assume that there are only three positive
value relations. If there are additional positive value relations,
incomparability is one, but not the only, subset of
incommensurability.</p>

<p>
Of course, when two value bearers are incommensurable, cardinal
comparisons are impossible. Unfortunately, our terminology lacks a
distinct term to describe cases where cardinality is absent, but
ordinality remains possible. While this is an interesting possibility,
it has received less attention than the more radical notion of value
incommensurability. For this reason, ordinality without cardinality
will not be addressed further in this entry.</p>

<p>
Value comparisons are often taken to be a three-place relation:
<em>A</em> is compared with <em>B</em> with respect to <em>V</em>.
&ldquo;<em>V</em>&rdquo; is here some specific consideration for which
the items are being compared. One career may be incommensurable to
another with respect to the sense of purpose it will bring to your
life, yet they may be comparable with respect to financial stability
since one is clearly better than the other in this regard. Some argue
that without specifying this &ldquo;covering consideration&rdquo; the
comparative claim makes no sense (Chang 1997; Thomson 1997; Andersson
2016b). Often, however, the covering consideration is not explicitly
expressed but implicitly assumed by the context of utterance.</p>

<p>
Specifying the covering consideration also allows us to identify
&ldquo;noncomparability&rdquo;. If the covering consideration
isn&rsquo;t applicable to the items we are comparing, then they are
noncomparable. For example, the number four is noncomparable with the
color blue with respect to their tastiness. This form of comparative
failure is considered to be of no interest from the perspective of
practical reasoning and is consequently not given much consideration
in the literature.</p>

<h2 id="PossInco">2. The Possibility of Incommensurability</h2>

<p>
The philosophical interest on incommensurability is often motivated by
its possible significance for rational choice (Broome 1997, 2000;
Chang 1997, 2002; Griffin 1986; Raz 1986). Comparing alternatives is
central for rational choice, intuitively we want to know what
alternative is the best, and thus examples of incommensurability may
pose a challenge to rational decision-making. As we will see, many
have met this challenge by developing theories of rational choice that
allow for incommensurability or reject the possibility of
incommensurability. However, let us first consider the arguments in
favor of incommensurability.</p>

<p>
The possibility of incommensurability is often argued for by
introducing examples that seem to point to its possible instantiation.
These examples often take a form similar to that of Joseph Raz&rsquo;s
example in which a person faces the choice between two successful
careers: one as a lawyer and one as a clarinettist. Neither career
seems better than the other, and they also do not appear to be equally
good. If they were of equal value, then a slightly improved version of
the legal career would be better than the musical career, but this
judgment appears incorrect (Raz 1986, 332).</p>

<p>
Ruth Chang has called this the &ldquo;Small Improvement
Argument&rdquo; (Chang 2002, 667). The Small Improvement Argument
takes the following general form: If (1) <em>A</em> is neither better
nor worse than <em>B</em> (with respect to <em>V</em>), (2)
<em>A</em>+ is better than <em>A</em> (with respect to <em>V</em>),
(3) <em>A</em>+ is not better than <em>B</em> (with respect to
<em>V</em>), then (4) <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are not better, worse
or equally as good (with respect to <em>V</em>), where <em>V</em>
represents the relevant set of considerations for purposes of the
comparison (Chang 2002, 667&ndash;668). By providing examples in which
each premise is true we have succeeded in showing that there is
incommensurability.</p>

<p>
In addition to Raz, Derek Parfit, and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong are
among those who have advanced the Small Improvement Argument (Parfit
1984; Sinnott-Armstrong 1985). A similar argument, but for preference
relations has, however, a longer history. Leonard J. Savage hints at
this possibility already 1954, in 1958 R. Duncan Luce presented a
version of the argument that he attributes to Howard Raiffa, and it
was also discussed by Ronald de Sousa in 1974 (Savage 1954; Luce 1958;
de Sousa 1974).</p>

<p>
Some, however, do not accept the Small Improvement Argument; they
reject the possibility of incommensurability and argue for complete
comparability. For example, it could be that value bearers are, in
fact, comparable, but due to epistemic constraints, they appear
incommensurable to us (Forrester 2022). With more knowledge about the
value bearers, it might be possible to provide both an ordinal and
cardinal ranking of them, but for some reason, acquiring all the
relevant knowledge may be practically difficult or even impossible.
Others argue that the relevant concepts or natural language do not
allow for incommensurability (Regan 1997; Dorr, Nebel &amp; Zuehl
2023). One way to argue for this is to claim that it is a logical fact
that all comparatives take the form &ldquo;<em>x</em> is at least as
<em>F</em> as <em>y</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>y</em> is at least as
<em>F</em> as <em>x</em>&rdquo;. From considerations such as these, it
is established that there cannot be value incommensurability.</p>

<p>
Another influential view is that the Small Improvement Argument merely
establishes incommensurability and not incomparability; the argument
points to the existence of additional value relations beyond
&ldquo;better than&rdquo;, &ldquo;worse than&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;equally as good&rdquo;. It is argued that incommensurability
does not imply incomparability but rather involves a positive value
relation. This perspective is preferable from the perspective of
rational choice, as it is argued that the existence of a positive
value relation between two options allows for a rational decision to
be made (more on this in 4.1). This view is often contrasted with a
conservative view, which holds that alleged cases of
incommensurability can be accounted for within the framework of the
three standard value relations if we acknowledge the possibility of
vagueness.</p>

<p>
The next two sections summarize the two latter views.</p>

<h3 id="IncoVagu">2.1 Incommensurability is Vagueness</h3>

<p>
It is plausible that it can be indeterminate of two items how they
relate with respect to their value. That is, there can be value
indeterminacy, which is a separate notion from value
incommensurability and value incomparability. For example, Raz argued
that both incomparability and indeterminacy of value are possible,
with the latter resulting from the &ldquo;general indeterminacy of
language&rdquo; (1986, 324).</p>

<p>
In contrast, some philosophers argue that there is no
incommensurability and that indeterminacy can account for alleged
cases of incommensurability (Griffin 1986, 96; Broome 1997, 2000,
2022; Andersson 2017; Elson 2017; Dos Santos 2019). In essence, it is
irrefutable that semantic vagueness exists. For example, consider the
predicate &ldquo;is bald.&rdquo; This predicate is vague because it
has borderline cases: some individuals are clearly bald, others are
clearly not bald, and some fall into a borderline category where it is
indeterminate whether they are bald. This indeterminacy does not
dissolve by making a precise count of the number of hairs on the
individuals that fall into the borderline category; the indeterminacy
arises from the vagueness of the predicate.</p>

<p>
The same applies to value predicates such as &ldquo;is at least as
good as.&rdquo; For instance, while it may be obvious that <em>A</em>
is at least as good as <em>B</em> and that <em>B</em> is at least as
good as <em>C</em>, the predicate may exhibit borderline cases. It
might be indeterminate whether <em>D</em> is at least as good as
<em>B</em> or whether <em>B</em> is at least as good as <em>D</em>.
The vagueness of the predicate can thus lead to situations where it is
indeterminate which value relation&mdash;such as &ldquo;better
than,&rdquo; &ldquo;worse than,&rdquo; or &ldquo;equally good
as&rdquo;&mdash;holds between the items being compared. This
indeterminacy, it is argued, can easily be mistaken for
incommensurability. Remember, incommensurability arises when it is
false that one value bearer is better, worse, or equally as good as
another. Indeterminacy, on the other hand, occurs when it is neither
true nor false that any of these relations individually obtain.
Furthermore, indeterminacy is often considered less worrisome than
incommensurability; after all, one of the standard value relations
does obtain, but it is indeterminate which one.</p>

<p>
Adherents of the view have also argued that the Small Improvement
Argument fails to rule out the possibility that it is indeterminate
how the value bearers relate; they may be related by one of the
standard trichotomous relations, but it could be indeterminate which
one (Wasserman 2004; Klockseim 2010; Gustafsson 2013a).</p>

<p>
There are also more positive arguments in favor of the vagueness
interpretation. The most influential comes from John Broome, who
argues that vagueness is incompatible with incommensurability.
Therefore, since vagueness cannot be denied, Broome suggests we should
reject incommensurability. His argument is somewhat technical and
requires a detailed explanation that cannot be fully provided here.
But it can be noted that central to his argument is his controversial
&ldquo;collapsing principle&rdquo; for comparatives (1997, 74). Many
counterexamples have been presented to show the implausibility of the
principle (Carlson 2004, 2013; Elson 2014b; Gustafsson 2018). While
there are attempts to defend the collapsing principle, or versions of
it (Constantinescu 2012; Andersson &amp; Herlitz 2018), the
counterexamples weaken Broome&rsquo;s argument. If the principle
central to his reasoning is questionable, we should be cautious about
accepting his conclusion that incommensurability does not exist.</p>

<p>
There are, however, additional arguments supporting the vagueness
interpretation. For example, some argue that it is theoretically
parsimonious: since it is natural to accept the existence of
evaluative vagueness, and if it can easily account for alleged cases
of incommensurability, there is no need to accept the more mysterious
notion of incommensurability or introduce additional value relations
beyond the standard trichotomous ones (Andersson 2017; Elson
2017).</p>

<h3 id="RougEquaPar">2.2 &ldquo;Roughly Equal&rdquo; and &ldquo;On a Par&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Others have argued that the Small Improvement Argument may support
value incommensurability but it need not necessarily support the
existence of incomparability. Instead, they propose that some or all
cases of incommensurability represent a previously overlooked
additional way in which things can be positively related.</p>

<p>
Central to their argument is the claim that the Small Improvement
Argument implicitly assumes that things can only be positively related
in terms of one of the standard trichotomy of comparative relations,
&ldquo;better than,&rdquo; &ldquo;worse than,&rdquo; or &ldquo;equally
good&rdquo; this is what Chang calls the &ldquo;Trichotomy
Thesis&rdquo; (2002b, 660). If these three comparative relations do
not exhaust the space of comparative relations we cannot arrive at the
conclusion that the items under consideration are not positively
related; the musical career and the legal career may, in fact, be
comparable with respect to a fourth value relation.</p>

<p>
The first arguments along these lines were expressed by James Griffin
and Derek Parfit who argue that items may in fact be &ldquo;roughly
equal&rdquo; and hence comparable (Griffin 1986, 80&ndash;81,
96&ndash;98, and 104; 1997, 38&ndash;39; 2000, 285&ndash;289; Parfit
1987, 431). As an illustration, Parfit presents an example
structurally similar to Raz&rsquo;s comparison of two careers. In
Parfit&rsquo;s example, the comparison involves two poets and a
novelist competing for a literary prize (1987, 431). Neither the First
Poet nor the Novelist is worse than the other and the Second Poet is
slightly better than the First Poet. If the First Poet and the
Novelist were equally good, it would follow that the Second Poet is
better than the Novelist. This judgment, according to Parfit, need not
follow. Instead, the First Poet and the Novelist may be roughly equal.
The intuition is that even though three items display the respects in
virtue of which the comparisons are made, some comparisons are
inherently rough so that even though two alternatives are not worse
than one other, they are not precisely equally good. In turn, the
musical and legal careers in Raz&rsquo;s example may be roughly equal.
Parfit later referred to this possibility as there being
&ldquo;evaluative imprecision&rdquo; allowing for the relation
&ldquo;imprecisely equally as good&rdquo; (Parfit 2016, 113).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Roughly equal,&rdquo; as used here, is to be distinguished from
two other ways in which the term has been used: (1) to refer to a
small difference in value between two items and (2) to refer to a
choice of little significance (Raz 1986, 333). As used here, two items
A and B are said to be roughly equal if neither is worse than the
other and C&rsquo;s being better than B does not imply that C is
better than A when the comparisons are all in virtue of the same set
of respects.</p>

<p>
One way to conceive of &ldquo;roughly equal&rdquo; is as a
&ldquo;roughed up&rdquo; version of &ldquo;equally good.&rdquo; On
this interpretation, the trichotomy thesis holds; there are only three
positive value relations, but these can be precise or rough (Chang
2002, 661, fn. 5). This account may appear very similar to the
vagueness interpretation; however, it is important to note that Parfit
explicitly distinguishes it from semantic vagueness (Parfit 2016).
When introducing the notion of &ldquo;evaluative imprecision,&rdquo;
he explicitly states: &ldquo;Such imprecision is not the result of
vagueness in our concepts, or our lack of knowledge, but is part of
what we would know if we knew the full facts&rdquo; (2016, 113). This
might suggest that imprecision is akin to metaphysical
vagueness&mdash;i.e., vagueness inherent in the fabric of the world
rather than our concepts. However, Parfit rejects this interpretation
as well. According to him, evaluative imprecision and rough equality
should not be equated with vagueness.</p>

<p>
A similar but separate and more developed proposal is Ruth
Chang&rsquo;s argument for the concept of &ldquo;on a par&rdquo;
(Chang 1997; Chang 2002). Two items are said to be on a par if neither
is better than the other, their differences preclude their being
equally good, and yet they are not incomparable. Imagine comparing
Mozart and Michelangelo in terms of creativity. According to Chang,
neither Mozart nor Michelangelo is less creative than the other.
Because the two artists display creativity in such different fields,
however, it would be mistaken to judge them to be equally creative.
Nevertheless, according to Chang, they are not incomparable but in
fact comparable with respect to creativity. Something positive can be
said about their relative merits with respect to the same
consideration. According to Chang, they are on a par.</p>

<p>
To argue for the comparability of the two artists, Chang presents the
&ldquo;Chaining Argument&rdquo;. She asks us to imagine a sequence of
sculptors who are successively worse than Michelangelo until we arrive
at a sculptor who is clearly worse than Mozart in terms of creativity.
Chang then brings to bear the intuition that &ldquo;between two
evaluatively very different items, a small unidimensional difference
cannot trigger incomparability where before there was
comparability&rdquo; (2002b, 673). In light of this intuition, because
Mozart is comparable to this bad sculptor, Mozart is also comparable
to each of the sculptors in the sequence, including Michelangelo. (For
objections to the argument see Boot 2009; Elson 2014a; Andersson
2016a).</p>

<p>
Chang argues that her account differs from Parfit&rsquo;s, asserting
that parity constitutes a distinct fourth value relation rather than a
&ldquo;roughened&rdquo; version of equality. On her interpretation,
rough equality corresponds to betterness or worseness without
cardinality. That is, stating that the First Poet is roughly equal to
the Novelist is equivalent to asserting that one is better than the
other, though it is impossible to specify by how much. On this
interpretation of &ldquo;rough equality,&rdquo; there is a stark
difference between the notions. Unfortunately, the elusiveness of
Parfit&rsquo;s &ldquo;rough equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprecise
equality&rdquo; makes it difficult to determinately ascertain how
these notions ought to be understood and, consequently, how they
differ from Chang&rsquo;s concept of parity.</p>

<p>
Interestingly, some have argued that we can accept parity and accept
the trichotomy thesis. For example, Erik Carlson (2010) has argued
that parity can be defined in terms of the three standard comparative
relations and provides a formal definition of the relation.</p>

<p>
Inspired by Joshua Gert (2004), Wlodek Rabinowicz (2008; 2012) has
argued that while the trichotomy thesis may be false, the existence of
parity does not threaten the traditional trichotomy of preference
relations: prefer, equiprefer, and disprefer. He demonstrates this by
providing a Fitting Attitudes account of value. The Fitting Attitudes
account typically analyzes goodness in terms of a normative component
and an attitudinal component. By acknowledging that there can be two
levels of normativity&mdash; requirement, and permissibility&mdash;the
account accommodates both parity and standard value relations.</p>

<p>
On the account, <em>X</em> is better than <em>Y</em> if and only if it
is rationally required to prefer <em>X</em> to <em>Y</em>, and
<em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are on a par if and only if it is rationally
permissible to prefer <em>X</em> to <em>Y</em> and also rationally
permissible to prefer <em>Y</em> to <em>X</em>. Interestingly,
preferences and the lack of preferences, combined with the two levels
of normativity, yield 15 possible combinations. This means that the
Fitting Attitudes analysis provides conceptual space for 15 possible
value relations. Rabinowicz thus provides an account that allows for
several value relations beyond parity, betterness, worseness, and
equality, making Chang&rsquo;s claim about a fourth possible value
relation seem modest. However, he acknowledges that these are merely
logical possibilities and that other factors may limit which of these
can be instantiated. While there is room for plenty of relations, he
defines imprecise equality in the same way as parity.</p>

<p>
Johan Gustafsson (2013b) has, however, questioned Rabinowicz&rsquo;s
approach. He aims to show that the axiological argument for parity can
also apply to preference relations. Thus, if Chang&rsquo;s argument is
correct, we should also accept the possibility of a fourth preference
relation.</p>

<h2 id="ArguForValuInco">3. Arguments for Value Incommensurability</h2>

<p>
While recent research has focused on interpreting examples with the
structure described by the Small Improvement Argument, earlier
research placed less emphasis on the structure of value and instead
concentrated on substantive considerations that supported
incommensurability, which at the time was understood to imply value
incomparability.</p>

<p>
The most obvious argument for value incommensurability comes from
value pluralism (e.g., Berlin 1969). If one value bearer instantiates
one value and another value bearer instantiates a completely different
value, then it is possible that these two value bearers are
incommensurable with respect to their value. One can of course resist
this claim and object that the two value bearers may be comparable
despite the fact that they instantiate values that differ greatly in
character. Here the notion of &ldquo;covering consideration&rdquo;
becomes relevant. When comparing value bearers with respect to their
overall value, they may seem incommensurable. However, there can be
other covering considerations to which they are comparable. To give an
example: an act that instantiates equality may seem incommensurable
with an act that instantiates liberty when considering their overall
value. However, if the focus shifts to the criterion of increasing
liberty, the latter act is clearly better.</p>

<p>
Pluralism alone does not necessarily entail incommensurability.
However, many of the arguments in favor of value incommensurability
provide examples of cases where we face choices involving alternatives
that instantiate different values, and which we intuitively deem to be
incommensurable. Thus, pluralism is often accepted, either implicitly
or explicitly.</p>

<p>
One need, of course, not refer to a plethora of values in order to
argue for the possibility of incommensurability. Two values that are
normatively irreducible are sufficient. Consider e.g., the Dualism of
Practical Reason as discussed by Henry Sidgwick. Roughly, Sidgwick
(1874 p. 507&ndash;509) argued that what is morally right can
sometimes conflict with what is prudential right. Our duty and our
self-interest are derived from different basic principles and are thus
normatively irreducible. This results in a dualism of practical reason
that can, on some occasions, lead to conflicting requirements. In the
same sense, it is possible to argue that there are personal and
impersonal values that are normatively irreducible and hence give rise
to incommensurability.</p>

<p>
We should also note that value monism may be compatible with
incommensurability. As Ruth Chang points out, by referring to John
Stuart Mill, that value may have both qualitative and quantitative
aspects could in principle allow for value bearers to be incomparable
due to a difference in their qualitative features. (Chang 1997,
16&ndash;17). To this, one can of course question if Mill is to be
characterized as a monist.</p>

<p>
In this section, some specific, substantial considerations in favor of
incommensurability will be discussed.</p>

<h3 id="ConsInco">3.1 Constitutive Incommensurability</h3>

<p>
It has been argued that value incommensurability is constitutive of
certain goods and values and consequently, we should assume its
existence.</p>

<p>
One version of this argument comes from Joseph Raz. Consider being
offered a significant amount of money to leave one&rsquo;s spouse for
a month. The indignation that is typically experienced in response to
such an offer, according to Raz, is grounded in part in the symbolic
significance of certain actions (1986, 349). In this case, &ldquo;what
has symbolic significance is the very judgment that companionship is
incommensurable with money&rdquo; (1986, 350). Although this form of
value incommensurability looks like trumping, Raz does not see this as
a case of trumping. He rejects the view that companionship is more
valuable than money. If such a view were correct, then those who forgo
companionship for money would be acting against reason (1986, 352).
Instead, Raz takes the view that a &ldquo;belief in incommensurability
is itself a qualification for having certain relations&rdquo; (1986,
351). Someone who does not regard companionship and money as
incommensurable simply has chosen a kind of life that may be
fulfilling in many ways, but being capable of having companionship is
not one of them.</p>

<p>
In Raz&rsquo;s account, the symbolic significance of judging money to
be incommensurable with companionship involves the existence of a
social convention that determines participation in that convention
(e.g., marriage) that requires a belief in value incommensurability.
This conventional nature of belief in value incommensurability in
Raz&rsquo;s account raises a question for some authors about its
robustness as an account of value incommensurability. For example,
Chang objects that incommensurability appears to become relative to
one&rsquo;s participation in social conventions (2001, 48). It remains
an open question how much of a problem this point raises. Raz&rsquo;s
account appears to illustrate a basic sense in which the values of
money and companionship can be incommensurable. Insofar as it is not
against reason to choose money over companionship, there is no general
way to resolve a conflict of values between money and companionship.
In Raz&rsquo;s account, the resolution depends upon which social
convention one has chosen to pursue.</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Anderson advances a second argument for constitutive
incommensurability. Her account is grounded in a pragmatic account of
value. Similar to a Fitting Attitudes account of value Anderson
reduces &ldquo;&lsquo;x is good&rsquo; roughly to &lsquo;it is
rational to value x,&rsquo; where to value something is to adopt
toward it a favorable attitude susceptible to rational
reflection&rdquo; (1997, 95). She argues that in virtue of these
attitudes, there may be no good reason to compare the overall values
of two goods. Pragmatism holds that if such a comparison serves no
practical function, then the comparative value judgment has no truth
value, meaning that the goods are incommensurable (1997, 99). Because
the favorable attitudes one adopts toward goods help to make them
good, Anderson&rsquo;s account has been seen as an argument for
constitutive incommensurability (Chang 2001, 49). However, it would be
more correct to label it constitutive indeterminacy since on her view
it is not false that the standard value relations obtain, it is rather
neither true nor false that they obtain.</p>

<p>
Anderson advances three ways in which there may be no good reason to
compare the overall values of goods. First, it may be boring or
pointless to engage in comparison. To illustrate, &ldquo;the project
of comprehensively ranking all works of art in terms of their
intrinsic aesthetic value is foolish, boring, and stultifying&rdquo;
(1997, 100). Second, Anderson points to instances in which &ldquo;it
makes sense to leave room for the free play of nonrational motivations
like whims and moods&rdquo; as in the choice of what to do on a
leisurely Sunday afternoon (1997, 91). Third, Anderson argues that the
roles that goods play in deliberation can be so different that
&ldquo;attempts to compare them head to head are incoherent&rdquo;
(1997, 91). Imagine that the only way to save one&rsquo;s dying mother
is to give up a friendship. Rather than compare their overall values,
argues Anderson, ordinary moral thinking focuses on what one owes to
one&rsquo;s mother and one&rsquo;s friends (1997, 102). This focus on
obligation recognizes mother and friend each to be intrinsically
valuable and yet valuable in different ways (1997, 103). There is no
good reason, according to Anderson, to compare their overall values
with regard to some common measure.</p>

<p>
Chang argues against each of the three points raised by Anderson
(Chang 2001). In response to the first point, Chang notes there are
occasions in which comparisons do need to be made between goods for
which Anderson argues there is no good reason to make comparisons. In
response to the second point, Chang argues that the range of instances
for which the second argument applies is small. In response to the
third point, Chang contends that Anderson&rsquo;s argument assumes
that if goods are comparable then they have some value or evaluative
property in common. Chang points out that this need not be the case.
As previously mentioned, we cannot assume that two value bearers are
incommensurable simply because they instantiate different values.</p>

<h3 id="MoraDile">3.2 Moral Dilemmas</h3>

<p>
Value incommensurability has been invoked to make sense of a central
feature of supposed moral dilemmas&mdash;namely, that no matter which
alternative the agent chooses, she fails to do something she ought to
do. The apparent value conflicts involved in these choices have led
some philosophers to relate moral dilemmas to the incommensurability
of values. A harrowing example of a moral dilemma is the situation
Sophie faces in Sophie&rsquo;s Choice, where, at a Nazi concentration
camp, she is forced by a guard to choose which of her two children
will live while the other is condemned to die. If she refuses to
decide, both children will be killed. Examples like this may suggest
that the incommensurability of her children&rsquo;s lives is what
makes this situation a moral dilemma.</p>

<p>
However, this may be a hasty conclusion, as it has been argued that
the mere existence of a moral dilemma does not necessarily imply
incommensurability. James Griffin, for example, argues that the
feature of &ldquo;irreplaceability&rdquo; in moral dilemmas often may
be mistaken as evidence for incommensurability (1997, 37).
Irreplaceability is the feature that what is lost in choosing one
alternative over another cannot be replaced by what is gained in
choosing another alternative. Choosing two scoops of vanilla ice cream
over one scoop of vanilla ice cream should not cause a feeling of
irreplaceability, however, choosing two scoops of vanilla ice cream
over one scoop of chocolate ice cream may cause a feeling of
irreplaceability, even if you clearly prefer vanilla over chocolate.
This feeling of irreplaceability or even regret can thus arise in
cases of comparability, it may even be rational (see Hurka 1996). If
we experience irreplaceability in moral dilemmas, we should not take
this as evidence for incommensurability.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, some moral dilemmas may involve not a conflict of values,
but a conflict of obligations that arises from the same consideration.
The dilemma encountering Sophie, it may be said, does not point to the
incommensurability of values as the options may be equally bad, but
rather a conflict of obligations that are equally strong. Walter
Sinnott-Armstrong calls such dilemmas &ldquo;symmetrical&rdquo; (1988,
54&ndash;58).</p>

<p>
Another common approach to argue for value incommensurability is with
reference to &ldquo;non-symmetrical&rdquo; dilemmas. As the name
suggests, in non-symmetrical dilemmas, the alternatives are favored by
different values (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988). If these values are
incommensurable there is no systematic resolution of the value
conflict. Consider Jean-Paul Sartre&rsquo;s well-known example of his
pupil who faced the choice between going to England to join the Free
French Forces and staying at home to help his mother live (Sartre
1975, 295&ndash;296). Thus, if value pluralism is correct, it allows
for the possibility of non-symmetrical dilemmas. If the phenomenology
of these dilemmas cannot be explained by irreplaceability, this
provides some support for the possibility of incommensurability.</p>

<h2 id="DeliChoi">4. Deliberation and Choice</h2>

<p>
As suggested above much of the inquiry into value incommensurability
is motivated more generally by theories of practical reason and
rational choice. This section considers these issues as they have been
discussed in contemporary philosophical literature.</p>

<h3 id="OptiMaxiComp">4.1 Optimization, Maximization, and Comparativism</h3>

<p>
The connection between value relations and choice is captured by
optimization. According to optimization, the fact that an alternative
is better or equally as good as the other alternatives is what
justifies its choice. Consequently, if two alternatives are
incommensurable no justified choice can be made between them. This
underscores the normative significance of value incommensurability: if
incommensurability is sufficiently pervasive, the scope for justified
choice becomes constrained.</p>

<p>
However, optimization can be contrasted with
&ldquo;maximization&rdquo; as a theory of justified choice (Sen 1997,
746; Sen 2000, 486). According to this theory, justified choice only
requires the choice of an alternative that is not worse than other
alternatives. Because incommensurable alternatives are not worse than
one another, the choice of either is justified according to the theory
of maximization as justified choice. After all, as Raz argues (1997),
if incommensurable options give us reasons to choose both
alternatives, then the choice of either alternative is justified on
the basis of reason. Thus, if maximization is correct the possibility
of incommensurable alternatives is less worrying. However, as we will
see in the next subsection, it may have some unwanted
consequences.</p>

<p>
Ruth Chang has argued for a view somewhat similar to optimization
called &ldquo;comparativism&rdquo;. According to this view:
&ldquo;comparative facts are what make a choice objectively correct;
they are that in virtue of which a choice is objectively rational or
what one has most or sufficient normative reason to do. So, whether
you are a consequentialist, deontologist, virtue theorist,
perfectionist, contractualist, etc., about the grounds of rational
choice, you should be, first and foremost, I suggest, a
comparativist&rdquo; (2016, 213). By &ldquo;comparative fact&rdquo;,
Chang refers to a positive value relation, such as one of the
traditional three or an additional relation, like parity. If
alternatives are incomparable rather than positively related, the
possibility of making an objectively rational choice is ruled out.
This perspective thus rejects maximization. While her view is similar
to optimization in that both require a positive value relation for a
justified choice, optimization restricts justification to the
traditional three relations, whereas comparativism allows any positive
value relation to justify a choice.</p>

<p>
Just as optimization, comparativism also entails that if
incomparability is pervasive, the scope for justified choice becomes
constrained. Those who find this to be a worrying conclusion can
respond that seemingly incomparable alternatives are, in fact,
comparable. As discussed in Section 2, judgments of incomparability
can be mistaken, and it is possible that, despite appearances, a
positive value relation obtains between two seemingly incomparable
alternatives. This means that there is a comparative fact that makes a
choice objectively correct in cases of apparent incomparability. There
remains the issue of determining which alternative we are justified in
choosing. This depends on the nature of the apparent incomparability
and our preferred theory of justified choice. Some suggestions come
naturally: If the alternatives are on a par, we may be justified in
choosing either. If it is indeterminate how the alternatives relate,
it may likewise be indeterminate which alternative we are justified in
choosing. Finally, if we lack sufficient knowledge of the alternatives
to determine how they relate, we may also lack sufficient knowledge to
make a justified choice.</p>

<p>
One can object to optimization and maximization by arguing that, at
times, we are justified in choosing what is &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;;
we can be satisficers. Optimizers and maximizers might argue that we
sometimes have instrumental reasons to settle for what is good enough,
aiming to achieve an overall maximal or optimal outcome later.
Satisficers, however, contend that we can have non-instrumental
reasons for choosing what is good enough (Slote 1989; Byron 2004). For
example, a person who does not always seek to maximize but instead
settles for a moderate amount of a good expresses, according to some,
a virtuous trait, and it is clear they are justified in acting in this
manner. If this view is correct, we must reject optimization and
maximization, and incommensurability may no longer be incompatible
with justified choice.</p>

<p>
The relation between comparativism and satisficing is less clear. As
comparativism is formulated above it does not express which
comparative facts that grounds a justified choice. It is thus in
theory possible to claim that the fact that an alternative is good
enough compared to the alternatives justifies the choice. This does
not, however, seem to be what Chang has in mind. To her, it is only
justified to choose an alternative that is better than, equally as
good, or on a par with the alternatives. For more on this see Stocker
(1990; 1997) and Chang (2016, 228).</p>

<h3 id="CyclChoi">4.2 Cyclical Choice</h3>

<p>
One objection voiced against accounts that permit justified choice
between alternatives that are roughly equal or on a par or between
incomparable alternatives is that such accounts may justify a series
of choices that leave a person worse off. Consider Raz&rsquo;s example
of career choice. Suppose a person chooses a musical career over a
legal career. At a later time, she has the opportunity to pursue a
legal career that is slightly worse than the initial legal career.
Suppose this slightly worse legal career and the musical career are
judged to be roughly equal, on a par, or incomparable. If justified
choice permits her to choose between two alternatives when they are
incommensurable, then she would be justified in choosing the slightly
worse legal career. Later, she may have the opportunity to pursue a
musical career that is slightly worse than her initial musical career.
This new musical career may also be roughly equal, on a par, or
incomparable with the legal career, justifying her choice of the
slightly worse musical career. Through a series of such justified
choices, she could end up significantly worse off. To complicate
matters further, assume she is now offered the option to pay a small
monetary cost to swap from the worse musical career back to the
initial musical career. Since the initial musical career is better, it
seems justified for her to pay a small amount to obtain it. However,
she has now returned to the same choice situation she faced initially,
but through a series of justified choices, she has lost money. This
appears to be an undesirable feature of a theory of justified
choice.</p>

<p>
One line of response is that the considerations that make some
alternatives worthy of choice count against the constant switching
among alternatives envisioned in this objection. First, the constant
switching among alternatives is akin to not choosing an alternative.
If the alternatives are such that choosing either is better than
choosing neither, then the considerations that make the alternatives
worthy of choice count against constantly switching among them.
Second, switching constantly among careers appears to misunderstand
what makes the alternatives worthy of choice. Not only is pursuing a
career the kind of activity that depends upon continued engagement for
its success, but it is also the kind of activity that is unlikely to
be judged truly successful unless one demonstrates some commitment to
it. Third, for a career to be considered successful, it may require
the chooser to adopt a favorable attitude toward the considerations
that favor it over other careers. In turn, when subsequently presented
with the choice of a legal career, the considerations favoring it may
no longer apply to her in the same way as they did before (Hsieh
2007). When a choice is made, some of our preferences may genuinely
shift to align with and deepen our appreciation of the chosen
alternative, making it the better option of the two.</p>

<p>
John Broome (2000) acknowledges that decision-making can sometimes
create value, as described above, but he doubts that this is always
the case. Instead, he suggests that choosing a career in law over one
in music is also, inherently, a decision to choose a career in law
over less favorable options in music. Thus, if you choose a career in
law over one in music and are later presented with the opportunity to
switch to a less successful career in music, the decision has already
been made; you should stick to the career in law. Of course, one is
free to change their mind and pursue a career that was previously
rejected. Such behavior is not problematic, according to Broome,
provided one repudiates their previous choice (2000, 38). While it is
true that such a change may leave you worse off than you could have
been, as long as you disown your prior choice, your action is not
irrational or puzzling according to Broome. By this, he rejects the
view that it is inherently irrational to end up worse off than you
could have been. The problem, he argues, arises &ldquo;[i]f at one
single time you are willing to endorse both decisions, then you are
certainly in a puzzling condition&rdquo; (2000, 34).</p>

<p>
Ruth Chang advances a hybrid view on rational choice to meet the
challenge of cyclical choice. She distinguishes &ldquo;given
reasons&rdquo; from &ldquo;will-based&rdquo; reasons. Roughly put,
given reasons could here be understood as those that are grounded in
normative facts while will-based reasons are &ldquo;reasons in virtue
of some act of the will; they are a matter of our creation. They are
voluntarist in their normative source. In short, we create will-based
reasons and receive given ones.&rdquo; (Chang 2013, 177). Will-based
reasons come into play when the given reasons no longer can guide our
actions. When two alternatives are on a par, given reasons fail to
guide us and at this stage, will-based reasons can provide guidance
and guarantee that the agent commits to her choice. Once a choice has
been made between two alternatives that are on a par, we can commit to
one option and thereby will reasons into existence that ensure we will
stick to that choice if we face the same decision again.</p>

<p>
This latter view captures a general idea that incommensurability
provides us with an opportunity to express our will. Instances of
incommensurability allow us to not merely act as automatons that
merely respond to our given reasons but a possibility to exercise our
will (e.g., Raz 1997).</p>

<h3 id="RiskActi">4.3 Risky Actions</h3>

<p>
Caspar Hare (2010) introduces and discusses a problem relating to how
rational choice theory can encompass risky actions involving outcomes
that are on a par. If we assume that two outcomes, <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>, are on a par, it follows that a small improvement, or mild
sweetening as Hare phrases it, to one of the outcomes would not break
the parity relation. We can then imagine two actions, <em>X</em> and
<em>Y</em>. If we opt for <em>X</em> then we will either end up with a
sweetened <em>A</em> in state 1 or a sweetened <em>B</em> in state 2,
and the outcomes are equiprobable. If we opt for <em>Y</em>, we will
end up with <em>B</em> in state 1 or <em>A</em> in state 2, and the
outcomes are equiprobable.</p>

<p>
Now should we do <em>X</em> or <em>Y</em>? On the one hand, it seems
as if we ought to opt for <em>X</em> since we are sure that will end
up with a sweetened alternative, <em>A</em>+ or <em>B</em>+ which is
preferable to merely <em>A</em> or <em>B</em>. On the other hand, it
is difficult to say why <em>X</em> is better than <em>Y</em>. The
outcome in state 1 is not better if we do <em>X</em> rather than
<em>Y</em> since the outcomes, <em>A</em>+ and <em>B</em>, are on a
par, and the outcome in state 2 is not better if we do <em>Y</em>
rather than <em>X</em> since the outcomes, <em>B</em>+ and <em>A</em>,
are on a par.</p>

<p>
Hare argues that we should &ldquo;take the sugar&rdquo;, i.e., we
ought to opt for <em>X</em>. There is, however, an ongoing debate with
little consensus on whether there are reasons to take sugar or not
(see e.g., Schoenfield 2014; Bales, Cohen &amp; Handfield 2014; Bader
2018; Doody 2019; Rabinowicz 2021b).</p>

<h2 id="RepuConcSpecArgu">5. The Repugnant Conclusion and Spectrum Arguments</h2>

<p>
We often come across the notion of value incommensurability in the
field of population axiology. It was, after all, a puzzle within
population axiology that led Parfit to introduce the notion of
&ldquo;rough equality&rdquo; and later the notion of
&ldquo;imprecision&rdquo;. He suggested that by acknowledging the
possibility of &ldquo;rough equality&rdquo; we may be able to escape
the so-called Repugnant Conclusion (Parfit 1987, 430) which states
that: &ldquo;For any possible population of at least ten billion
people, all with a very high quality of life, there must be some much
larger imaginable population whose existence, if other things are
equal, would be better even though its members have lives that are
barely worth living&rdquo; (Parfit, 388). The conclusion finds support
in what Parfit calls the Continuum Argument (Parfit 2016). We are
asked to imagine a spectrum of possible populations, starting with a
population consisting of excellent lives. At each step in the
spectrum, there is a small drop in the quality of life for each
individual, but this is compensated for by a much larger population,
making the latter population overall better than the former. As we
progress along the spectrum, the quality of life continues to decrease
while the population size increases. Eventually, we arrive at a very
large population whose members have lives that are barely worth
living. By the transitivity of betterness, we can infer that this
population is better than the one at the top of the spectrum.</p>

<p>
If we assume that the standard three value relations fully exhaust the
way populations can relate with respect to value then the transitivity
of these relations seems, indeed, to imply the Repugnant Conclusion.
However, if we allow for the possibility of e.g., parity, it is
possible to claim that some adjacent populations in the spectrum are
related by such a relation and thus we have found a way to block the
argument. If there are instances of parity along the spectrum the
sequence of betterness relations is broken and we can no longer refer
to the transitivity of betterness to reach the conclusion (Chang
2016).</p>

<p>
We need of course not refer to parity, incomparability, or some other
form of incommensurability to argue that there is a break along the
sequence of betterness relations. It is also possible to claim that
for some adjacent populations in the spectrum, the larger population
is worse than the smaller population. This may, however, be more
difficult to accept as it clashes with our intuitions concerning the
goodness of the populations; it is easier to accept that the larger
population is not better than the smaller one than to accept that it
is worse.</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that the relation invoked must be persistent
in the sense that it will obtain between two populations despite
quantitative increases to the larger population. That is, if we can
point to a break in the spectrum where two populations are related by
e.g., parity, the relation must persist despite making the larger
population even larger (Handfield &amp; Rabinowicz 2018; Chang 2022).
If the relation did not persist there would be a sufficiently large
population that was better than its adjacent smaller population and we
have failed to block the sequence of betterness relations.</p>

<p>
It may seem surprising that parity can be persistent in this sense, as
it appears to contradict the intuitions underlying the Chaining
Argument. According to this argument, a sufficient number of
diminutions can break the parity relation between e.g., two different
careers. In cases of persistent parity, however, quantitative
improvements cannot break the relation. Chang admits that persistent
parity is generally implausible: &ldquo;it is not the case for any two
items on a par that differ by one being a slight diminution in quality
and a large enhancement in quantity, that no matter how much we
increase the quantity, the items will remain on a par&mdash;two
careers may be on a par, but if we increase the salary of one of them
enough, it can be better&rdquo; (Chang 2022, 421). However, in a
spectrum like the one discussed above, Chang suggests that persistent
parity might be plausible.</p>

<p>
Invoking non-standard value relations to address the Repugnant
Conclusion is not limited to parity. The broader notion of
&ldquo;incommensurability&rdquo; is often invoked (e.g., H&aacute;jek
&amp; Rabinowicz (2022)), and Parfit (2016) introduced the concept of
&ldquo;imprecise equality&rdquo; to address the Repugnant Conclusion.
Nor is this approach limited to discussions of the Repugnant
Conclusion; similar reasoning applies to other arguments that use a
spectrum to reach counterintuitive results.</p>
