<h1>Feminist History of Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Nov 3, 2000; substantive revision Fri Sep 12, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The past decades have seen an explosion of feminist writing on the
philosophical canon, a development that has clear parallels in other
disciplines like literature and art history. Since most of the writing
is, in one way or another, critical of the tradition, a natural
question to ask is: Why does the history of philosophy have importance
for feminist philosophers? This entry answers the question by
exploring the different ways that feminist philosophers are
interacting with the European philosophical canon. While this entry
focuses on feminist engagement with European philosophy, recent
research has highlighted, for instance, the construction of womanhood
in Chinese Philosophy (R. Wang 2010) and seventeenth century Korean
women writing in the Confucian tradition (Ivanhoe &amp; H. Y. Wang,
2021, 2023); Waithe and Boos Dykeman (2023) provide a resource for
recovering the women philosophers in non-European traditions. We
cannot cover this broad a range of scholarship in this one article,
but we are optimistic that the framework applied to European
philosophy here can be helpful in feminist research in the history of
philosophy of other traditions.</p>

<p>
Feminist philosophers engaged in a project of re-reading and
re-forming the philosophical canon have noticed two significant areas
of concern. The first is the problem of historical exclusion. Feminist
philosophers are faced with a tradition that believes that there are
no women philosophers and, if there are any, they are unimportant. Of
course, women are not entirely absent from the history of philosophy,
and that brings us to the second challenge we face. Canonical
philosophers have had plenty to say about women and what we are like.
In general terms, we often find that philosophical norms like reason
and objectivity are defined in contrast to matter, the irrational or
whatever a given philosopher associates with women and the feminine
(Rooney 1991, 1994). The European tradition tells us, either
implicitly through images and metaphors, or explicitly in so many
words, that philosophy itself, and its norms of reason and
objectivity, exclude everything that is feminine or associated with
women. In response, feminist philosophers have criticized both the
historical exclusion of women from the philosophical tradition, and
the negative characterization of women or the feminine in it.</p>

<p>
The following entry contains 3 major sections.
 <a href="#FemCriCanMis">Section 1</a>
 (&ldquo;Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist&rdquo;)
describes feminist readings of the philosophical canon that challenge
its derogatory characterizations of women. These are of three kinds:
(a) readings that record the explicit misogyny of great philosophers
(like Aristotle&rsquo;s description of a female as, as it were, a
deformed male); (b) readings that argue for gendered interpretations
of theoretical concepts (like matter and form in Aristotle); (c)
synoptic interpretations of the canon (like the view that,
historically, reason and objectivity are gendered male).
 <a href="#FemRevHisPhi">Section 2</a>
 (&ldquo;Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy&rdquo;)
discusses the response of feminist historians to the twin myths that
there have been no women philosophers and, in any case, no important
ones. One response has been the retrieval of women philosophers for
the historical record. A related development is the elevation to the
canon of important women philosophers like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah
Arendt, and Simone de Beauvoir. Finally, feminist revisions to the
history of philosophy and the canon raise important and pressing
questions concerning how to weave women philosophers securely into the
story of philosophy so that they begin to appear in the philosophical
curriculum. This includes women of color and issues of race.
 <a href="#FemAppCanPhi">Section 3</a>
 (&ldquo;Feminist Appropriation of Canonical Philosophers&rdquo;)
examines the way that feminist philosophers have been engaged in
rereading the canon looking for antecedents to feminist philosophy in
the work of those philosophers (e.g., Hume) and those theories (e.g.,
Aristotle&rsquo;s virtue ethics) that are most congenial to current
trends in feminism or which provide most fuel for feminist thought.
This is to use the canon as other movements have done&mdash;as a
resource, and as confirmation that a feminist perspective or problem
is securely rooted in our philosophical culture. Feminists who are
critical of traditional methods of reading the history of philosophy
have proposed several alternative reading strategies that they argue
are better suited to feminist purposes than traditional methods. These
writers are particularly skeptical of the appropriation project
outlined in section 3 and their skepticism provokes interesting
questions about what it is we do when we do the history of philosophy.
(Freeland 2000; Le Doeuff 1989). Is there any principle of unity
common to the four distinct projects described in this entry? Feminist
historians of philosophy who work on, work with, and work against the
history of philosophy as traditionally conceived are challenging the
philosophical community to recognize new figures as philosophers, new
genres as philosophical, new uses of canonical texts as legitimate,
and new critical perspectives on them as valuable. One way to unify
the various strands of feminist work on the history of philosophy is
to think of it as a recognition project (Witt 2020). Using the concept
of recognition as the thread that weaves through and unifies feminist
engagements with the history of philosophy allows us to appreciate
this important work as both an epistemic and a political
achievement.</p>

<h2 id="FemCriCanMis">1. Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist</h2>

<blockquote class="bigindent">

</blockquote>

<p>
The idea that the gender of philosophers is important or even relevant
to their work is a thought that runs counter to the self-image of
philosophy. So, it is interesting to explore how and why feminist
philosophers came to the realization that gender is a useful analytic
category to apply to the history of philosophy. (Witt 2006) We can
distinguish two aspects to this process although, in many cases, the
two aspects merge into a single project. The first stage of realizing
the importance of gender consisted of the cataloging of the explicit
misogyny found in most of the canon. The second stage consisted of
probing the theories of canonical philosophers in order to uncover the
gender bias lurking in their supposedly universal theories. The second
stage, the discovery that a philosopher&rsquo;s supposedly universal
and objective theories were gender specific, raised the further
question of whether or not the theoretical gender bias was intrinsic
to the theory or extrinsic to it. Let me illustrate these points with
Aristotle.</p>

<h3 id="ExpStaMisPhiTex">1.1 Explicit Statements of Misogyny in Philosophical Texts</h3>

<p>
There is no doubt that Aristotle&rsquo;s texts contains statement that
are sexist, perhaps even misogynist; he thought that women were
inferior to men, and he said so explicitly. For example, to cite
Cynthia Freeland&rsquo;s catalog:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a
woman&rsquo;s lies in obeying; that &ldquo;matter yearns for form, as
the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful&rdquo;; that
women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male
or &ldquo;as it were, a deformity&rdquo;: which contributes only
matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general
&ldquo;a woman is perhaps an inferior being&rdquo;; that female
characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or
too clever. (Freeland 1994:
 145&ndash;46)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
However dispiriting or annoying this litany is, and whatever problems
it presents to a woman studying or teaching Aristotle, it can be
argued that Aristotle simply held a mistaken view about women and
their capacities (as did most Athenians of his time). But, if this is
so, then Aristotle&rsquo;s theories, or most of them, are not
tarnished by his statements about women, and we can ignore them, since
they are false.</p>

<p>
Here Aristotle is the chosen example, but similar feminist critiques
are available chronicling the explicit misogyny of other canonical
figures like Plato (Tuana 1994) and Kant. (Schott 1997) Feminist
criticisms of Plato&rsquo;s theories stress dialogues (like the
<em>Timaeus</em> and <em>Laws</em>) that characterize women as
inferior to men rather than the more egalitarian <em>Republic</em>.
Kant&rsquo;s writings, like Aristotle&rsquo;s, provide the ideal
target for feminist criticism because they contain both overt
statements of sexism and racism, and a theoretical framework that can
be interpreted along gender
 lines.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="GenIntPhiCon">1.2 Gendered Interpretations of Philosophical Concepts</h3>

<p>
As an example of a gendered interpretation of a philosophical concept
let&rsquo;s consider Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of hylomorphism where we
find a connection between form and being male, and matter and being
female. That is, we find that matter and form are gendered notions in
Aristotle (Witt 1998). By a gendered notion we mean a notion that is
connected either overtly or covertly, either explicitly or
metaphorically with gender or sexual
 difference.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Furthermore, matter and form are not equal partners in
Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysics; form is better than matter. And since
hylomorphism is the conceptual framework that underlies much
Aristotelian theory from metaphysics and philosophy of mind to biology
and literary theory, it looks as if his supposedly universal and
objective theories are gendered in a way that tarnishes his
philosophical theories (Freeland 2000).</p>

<p>
Are Aristotle&rsquo;s theories intrinsically gendered and sexist, so
that gender cannot be removed without altering the theories
themselves? Several feminist philosophers have developed this thesis.
For example, in &ldquo;Woman Is Not a Rational Animal&rdquo;, Lynda
Lange argues that Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of sex difference is
implicated in every piece of Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysical jargon,
and she concludes that &ldquo;it is not at all clear that it
[Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of sex difference] can simply be cut away
without any reflection on the status of the rest of the
philosophy&rdquo; (Lange 1983: 2). Elizabeth Spelman has argued that
Aristotle&rsquo;s politicized metaphysics is reflected in his theory
of soul, which, in turn, is used to justify the subordination of women
in the Politics (Spelman 1983). And, finally, Susan Okin has argued
that Aristotle&rsquo;s functionalist theory of form was devised by
Aristotle in order to legitimate the political status quo in Athens,
including slavery and the inequality of women (Okin 1979: ch. 4). More
recently Emanuela Bianchi (2014) argues for an interpretation of
Aristotle&rsquo;s texts that centers the concepts of sex and gender,
and thereby establishes Aristotle&rsquo;s structural commitment to
gender hierarchy. And, Adriel Trott (2019) both makes the case for an
enriched and nuanced interpretation of the relationship between matter
and form in Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysics and biology,
and&mdash;nonetheless&mdash;retains the view that matter and form are
intrinsically gendered notions in Aristotle. Finally, Mercer
(2018)argues that Aristotle&rsquo;s sexism follows directly from his
teleological worldview and normative view of nature.</p>

<p>
Important recent work on sexism in Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy
focuses on his theory of animal reproduction in the biological
writings. To what extent and in what ways is Aristotle&rsquo;s theory
of animal generation sexist? (Henry 2007; Nielsen 2008) Sophia Connell
(2016) interprets Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of animal reproduction as
recognizing different potentials coming from both male and female
parents, and as not intrinsically sexist because the theory does not
require that one source be better than the other. A related issue
concerns how (or whether) Aristotle&rsquo;s view of sexual difference
in the biology is connected to his ideas about gender hierarchy in the
<em>Politics</em> (Deslauriers 2009, 2022). Some argue that the
biology of female animals lays the foundation for, and perhaps even
explains, the unequal and subordinate political status attributed by
Aristotle to women citizens in the <em lang="grc">polis</em> (Mercer
2018; Deslauriers 2022).</p>

<h3 id="SynIntPhiCan">1.3 Synoptic Interpretations of the Philosophical Canon</h3>

<p>
Feminist critics working on the history of philosophy have urged that
the canon&rsquo;s central philosophical norms and values, like reason
and objectivity, are themselves gendered notions. The synoptic
approach considers the European philosophical tradition as a whole and
argues that its core concepts are gendered male or are sexist, or
both. But, if this is so, then the European philosophical tradition as
a whole and the central concepts that we have inherited from it
requires critical scrutiny by feminists. Moreover, philosophy&rsquo;s
self-image as universal and objective, rather than particular and
biased, is mistaken.</p>

<p>
Feminist synoptic interpretations of the canon take several forms
(Lloyd 2002). The first, exemplified by Genevieve Lloyd&rsquo;s
<em>Man of Reason</em>, argues that reason and objectivity in the
history of philosophy are gendered
 male.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 The way that reason and objectivity are gendered male varies as
philosophical theory and historical period varies, but the fact that
they are gendered is a constant. From Aristotle to Hume, from Plato to
Sartre, reason is associated with maleness. Therefore, the notion of
reason that we have inherited, whether we are empiricists or
existentialists, requires critical scrutiny. For Lloyd the maleness of
reason is symbolic and metaphorical rather than cultural or
psychological. Lloyd does not intend the maleness of reason to refer
to either a socially constituted gender category or a psychological
orientation shared by males.</p>

<p>
A second form of synoptic interpretation, exemplified by Susan
Bordo&rsquo;s <em>The Flight to Objectivity</em>, argues that the
modern period in philosophy, and, in particular, the philosophy of
Descartes, is the source of our ideals of reason and objectivity that
are gendered male. In other words, this story chronicles a turn in
philosophy coincident with the rise of modern science, which generated
ideals of reason and objectivity that are deeply antagonistic to women
and
 feminism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Cartesian rationalism and the norms of modern science mark a decisive
break with a philosophical and cultural tradition that was more
accommodating of female characteristics and powers.</p>

<p>
Finally, Luce Irigaray takes a radical stance towards the history of
philosophy by trying to indicate what is suppressed and hidden in the
tradition rather than cataloging its evident &ldquo;maleness&rdquo;.
Her work, like Bordo&rsquo;s, makes use of psychoanalytic theory in
interpreting texts and, like Genevieve Lloyd&rsquo;s, it explores the
symbolic associations of philosophical images and concepts. However,
unlike Bordo and Lloyd, Irigaray uses highly unconventional methods of
interpreting canonical philosophical texts in order to uncover the
ways in which the feminine or sexual difference is repressed in them.
For example, Irigaray uses humor and parody rather than
straightforward exegesis, and she points to instabilities
(contradictions) in philosophical texts as symptoms of patriarchal
thinking. According to Irigaray, patriarchal thinking attempts to
achieve universality by repressing sexual difference. But, the
presence of contradictions or instabilities in a philosophical text is
symptomatic of the failure of patriarchal thinking to contain sexual
difference. For example, Irigaray might look at the argument we
described above for considering gender associations with form and
matter in Aristotle to be extrinsic, rather than intrinsic, to those
concepts, and argue that the fact that Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphism
as a universal theory is incompatible with gender associations is a
symptom of patriarchal thinking rather than evidence that the proposed
interpretation is
 mistaken.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Despite their different historical stories, and the different ways
that they understand the maleness of reason, each of these panoramic
visions of the history of philosophy deliver the same moral, which is
that the central norms that inform our philosophical culture today are
gendered
 male.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Hence, these synoptic narratives of the philosophical tradition
provide historical justifications for feminist philosophers who are
critical of our central philosophical norms of reason and objectivity.
Does the feminist synoptic critical reading of the history of
philosophy justify either the conclusion that traditional conceptions
of reason ought to be flat-out rejected by feminists or the conclusion
that traditional conceptions of reason ought to be subjected to
critical scrutiny?</p>

<p>
Even if feminist historical arguments are successful in showing that
philosophical norms like reason and objectivity are gendered male,
this conclusion does not justify a flat-out rejection of either
traditional philosophy or its norms of reason and objectivity (Witt
1993). Recall the distinction introduced above between intrinsically
and extrinsically gendered notions. An intrinsically gendered notion
is one that necessarily carries implications regarding gender, i.e.,
if one were to cancel all implications concerning gender, one would be
left with a different notion than the original. In contrast, an
extrinsically gendered notion typically does carry implications
concerning gender, but not necessarily so. If the maleness of reason
is extrinsic to the traditional concept of reason, then the historical
fact that it was a gendered notion does not justify or require its
rejection by feminists. If on the other hand, it can be shown that the
maleness of reason is intrinsic to it, it still does not follow that
reason ought to be rejected by feminists. For, the idea the reason is
intrinsically male-biased would justify a rejection of it only if it
ought to be other than it is. So, what needs to be argued is that
reason and objectivity would be different, and better, if they were
not gendered male, but were gender-neutral, gender-inclusive or
female. But, if feminist philosophers develop this argument, which
they need to buttress the historical argument, then they are
reconceptualizing traditional notions of reason and objectivity rather
than rejecting them.</p>

<h2 id="FemRevHisPhi">2. Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy</h2>

<blockquote class="bigindent">
These women are not women on the fringes of philosophy, but
philosophers on the fringes of history. <span class="blockright">&mdash;Mary
Ellen Waithe (1989: xxxviii)</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
Feminist canon revision is most distinctive, and, arguably, most
radical, in its retrieval of women philosophers for the historical
record, and in its elevation of women philosophers to the canon. It is
a distinctive project because other contemporary philosophical
movements tend to select from an already established list of male
philosophers. It is a radical project because by uncovering a history
of women philosophers, it has destroyed the alienating myth that
philosophy was, and by implication is or ought to be, a male
preserve.</p>

<p>
In <em>A History of Women Philosophers</em> Mary Ellen Waithe has
documented at least 16 women philosophers in the classical world, 17
women philosophers from 500&ndash;1600, and over 30 from
1600&ndash;1900. In a recent work edited with Therese Boos Dyckman
<em>Women Philosophers from Non-Western Traditions: the First Four
Thousand Years</em> the authors document 22 women from traditions
centered in what are contemporary India, China, Japan, Korea, Tibet,
Nigeria, the Philippines, as well as the Sufi tradition and indigenous
traditions in Australia and North America.</p>

<p>
And, in the feminist series <em>Re-reading the Canon</em> seven of the
thirty-five canonical philosophers are women: including Mary
Wollstonecraft (Falco 1996), Hannah Arendt (Honig 1995), and Simone de
Beauvoir (Simons 1995). What is crucial to understand is that none of
the three is canonical&mdash;if by that you mean included in the
history of philosophy as it is told in philosophy department
curricula, in histories of philosophy, and in scholarly writing.
Still, there has been progress.</p>

<p>
Consider that <em>The Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Edwards 1967),
published in 1967, which contains articles on over 900 philosophers,
did not include an entry for Wollstonecraft, Arendt or de Beauvoir.
Moreover, if the index is to be believed, de Beauvoir and
Wollstonecraft are not mentioned at all in any article, and Hannah
Arendt merits a single mention in an article on
&ldquo;Authority&rdquo;. Far from being canonical, these women
philosophers were scarcely even marginal, warranting perhaps a passing
reference in a survey of existentialism or political philosophy, but
little
 more.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 By 1998, however, <em>The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>
(Craig 1998) had entries for all three, and also many other important
women philosophers.</p>

<p>
The project of retrieving women philosophers has a paradoxical
relationship with contemporary feminist theory, however. On the one
hand, it is clearly a feminist project; its originators were
interested in establishing that women have been philosophers
throughout the history of the discipline despite their routine
omission from standard histories and encyclopedias of philosophy.
However, the newly-recovered women philosophers suggest that there is
little overlap among three groups: women philosophers, feminine
philosophers, and feminist philosophers. For many of the newly
discovered women philosophers were not feminist thinkers nor did they
write philosophy in a feminine voice, different from their male
counterparts. Indeed, their breadth of philosophical interests is
comparable to that of male philosophers although their domain of
application sometimes differs. In her introduction to <em>A History of
Women Philosophers</em> Mary Ellen Waithe comments</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If we except the Pythagorean women, we find little differences in the
ways men and women did philosophy. Both have been concerned with
ethics, metaphysics, cosmology, epistemology and other areas of
philosophic inquiry. (Waithe 1987: xxi)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And another editor, Mary Warnock, comments &ldquo;In the end, I have
not found any clear &lsquo;voice&rsquo; shared by women
philosophers&rdquo; (Warnock 1996: xlvii). The women philosophers
restored to the tradition by feminist hands are not all
proto-feminists nor do they speak in a uniform, and different, voice
from their male peers.</p>

<p>
Similarly, women philosophers who are candidates for initiation into
the philosophical canon&mdash;like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt
and Simone de Beauvoir&mdash;are a diverse crew. According to
Elizabeth Young-Bruehl &ldquo;That Hannah Arendt should have become a
provocative subject for feminists is startling&rdquo; (blurb for Honig
1995) presumably because of Arendt&rsquo;s explicit criticism of
feminism. And while Wollstonecraft and de Beauvoir were both
feminists, they share neither a common philosophical voice nor common
philosophical principles. In <em>The Vindication of the Rights of
Women</em> (1792) Wollstonecraft argued for the education of women
using Enlightenment principles, while Beauvoir&rsquo;s <em>The Second
Sex</em> (1949) reflects her Marxist and existentialist roots.</p>

<p>
The diversity of women philosophers raises the question why their
recovery or re-valuation is an important project for contemporary
feminist theory. What the retrieval of women philosophers, and their
inclusion in the philosophical canon has done is to challenge the myth
that there are no women in the history of philosophy and the fallback
position that if there are any women philosophers, they are
unimportant. Lovers of wisdom that we all are, we all benefit from the
correction of these mistaken beliefs. Moreover, as feminists, we are
interested in correcting the effects of discrimination against women
philosophers, who were written out of history, unfairly, because of
their gender not their philosophical ideas.</p>

<p>
However, what is really at issue is not philosophy&rsquo;s past, but
its present; its self-image as male. That self-image is created and
maintained in part by a tacit historical justification. It is a
damaging self-image for women philosophers today, and for women who
aspire to be philosophers. The real significance of uncovering the
presence of women in our history, and in placing women in our canon is
the effect that has on the way we think about the &ldquo;us&rdquo; of
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The rediscovery of women philosophers raises the following question:
How can women philosophers be re-woven into the history of philosophy
so that they are an integral part of that history? Lisa Shapiro,
considering the case of women philosophers in the early modern period,
argues that it is not enough to simply add a woman philosopher or two
to the reading list (Shapiro 2004). Rather, according to Shapiro, we
need to provide internal reasons for the inclusion of women
philosophers rather than relying upon a feminist motivation on the
part of the teacher or editor. The history of philosophy is a story
and we need to find a plot line that includes new, female
characters.</p>

<p>
One way to do this is to show how certain women philosophers made
significant contributions to the work of male philosophers on central
philosophical issues. We could call this the &ldquo;Best Supporting
Actress&rdquo; approach in that the central cast remains male and the
story line of philosophy is undisturbed. It is a good strategy for
several reasons: it is relatively easy to accomplish, and it provides
an internal anchor for women philosophers. On the other hand, it
reinforces the secondary status of women thinkers and if this were the
only way of integrating women philosophers, that would be an
unfortunate result. The wholly inadequate interpretation of
Beauvoir&rsquo;s philosophical thought as a mere application of
Jean-Paul Sartre&rsquo;s is a good example of the limitations of this
strategy. Not only does is reinforce a secondary, handmaiden role for
Beauvoir, but it also promotes a distorted understanding and
appreciation of her thought (Simons 1995).</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we could find in the work of women philosophers issues
that they have developed in a sequential fashion. Shapiro suggests
that there are certain philosophical issues concerning women&rsquo;s
rationality, nature, and education that women philosophers of the
seventeenth century discuss extensively in a sequential, interactive
fashion. The thread extends into the following century in the work of
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Catharine Macaulay, and Wollstonecraft. Since
philosophers become canonical as part of a story anchored at one end
by contemporary philosophical questions that are thought to be
central, the task would be to make these questions ones that we turn
to the tradition for help in answering. And, of course, these are
precisely the central questions posed and discussed extensively by
contemporary feminism. Thus, the idea is that as we pose new kinds of
questions to the history of philosophy we will find in women
philosophers an important, sequential discussion that we can securely
thread into our curricula and textbooks.</p>

<p>
Scholars of early modern European philosophy have made the most
headway in retrieving the philosophical works of women, inaugurating
strategies for research, and providing resources for curriculum and
canon revision. For this reason the discussion that follows starts
with this period. Scholars of other historical periods in the European
tradition, in particular of Medieval philosophy and nineteenth and
early twentieth century philosophy, have now started to follow this
lead to undertake the recovery of women philosophers in those periods.
While it may seem odd to present the periods out of chronological
order, at this stage of the development of the field we think it
important to record the actual history and development of the
retrieval of women philosophers. Contemporary scholars concerned to
re-integrate these women into the philosophical canon have tended to
adopt a strategy that does not assume that standard philosophical
concepts or the canon itself are gender biased. Rather scholars aim
(1) to recover and make accessible again long out-of-print texts; (2)
to develop interpretations of these texts that (a) bring out their
philosophical content and (b) demonstrate the involvement of these
women in the philosophical debates of the period. The re-introduction
of women across the history of philosophy provides occasion to examine
basic methodology in the history of philosophy. The bibliographical
appendix to this entry can direct readers to some recent editions of
writings by historical women authors as well as secondary literature
on those authors and many others beyond that cited in the article
itself.</p>

<h3 id="WomEarModEurPhi">2.1 Women in Early Modern European Philosophy</h3>

<p>
From about the mid-1990s, there has been a concerted effort by
scholars both to rehabilitate the works of early modern women European
philosophers and to integrate at least some of these women into the
philosophical canon, which has been focused on European intellectual
history. These efforts illustrate how a range of different feminist
approaches to the history of philosophy can be integrated
together.</p>

<p>
While many contemporary philosophers have little knowledge of the
women philosophers of the early modern period, there are in fact good
historical records of these women and their works. This fact has made
the doxographic task of retrieving these women thinkers a relatively
straightforward one, even if labor intensive. O&rsquo;Neill (1998)
catalogs a long list these women, and her doxographical work has
provided a starting point for both expanding the list and interpreting
the philosophical works of these women.</p>

<p>
The recovery of philosophical work by women is an enormous task, and
it requires both returning to archival methods that undergirded the
development of philosophical canons in the nineteenth century and to
leverage new digital methods to make texts accessible and determine
lines of influence. Archival methods are necessary not only to recover
texts that are long out of print, but also to recover materials such
as pamphlets and correspondence by these women authors that provide
further context (Broad 2020a, Broad 2020b, Green 2020). Digital
methods can also be used to help transform entrenched practices.
Resources like the
 <a href="https://newn.dhil.lib.sfu.ca/" target="other">The New Narratives Bibliography of Works by Women Philosophers of the Past</a>
 lays bare publication history and can help in tracking intellectual
networks. Resources like
 <a href="https://projectvox.org/" target="other">Project Vox</a>
 provide contentful resources and curricular support. Both are being
extended to other historical periods and to regions outside of the
European context. In addition, digital editions of texts and
manuscript materials, like the resources on the pro-woman arguments of
the debate on women at
 <a href="http://querelle.ca/" target="other">Querelle</a>
 and the
 <a href="https://stp.historyofwomenphilosophers.org/" target="other">St. Petersburg manuscripts of Emilie du Ch&acirc;telet</a>,
 help open research questions.</p>

<p>
One of the central canonical themes of early modern philosophy is the
reconceptualization of causation. Scholastic philosophy largely
understood causation on an Aristotelian model, on which all change was
to be explained by a constellation of four causes: final, formal,
material, and efficient causes. Early modern thinking about causation
began with a rejection of final and formal causes. Determining final
causes involved a speculation that outstripped human understanding,
while formal causes were dismissed as occult qualities, simple
assertions that things worked without an intelligible explanation of
how they did so. Several canonical figures in early modern
philosophy&mdash;Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume, and Kant&mdash;are
often situated with respect to one another through their views on
causation. In recent years, Malebranche, with his account of
occasionalist causation (a view on which neither bodies nor minds have
causal power in themselves, and God is the only efficient cause) has
been worked into the story. What Malebranche highlights is that
understanding the nature of causation was a live philosophical
problem: while there was agreement about dismissing final and formal
causation, there was much disagreement about what should replace it,
and in particular about the nature of efficient causation. Some early
modern women thinkers were very much involved in this debate, and they
are just as easily incorporated into the philosophical story as
Malebranche. For instance, Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, in her 1643
correspondence with him, questions Descartes about the nature of
causation between mind and body (2007: 61&ndash;73). She can be read
as insisting that an adequate account of causation must be applicable
in all causal contexts. Margaret Cavendish, in her <em>Observations on
the Experimental Philosophy</em> (1666b), develops a vitalist account
of causation wherein motion is not transferred from one body to
another, but rather one body comes to be in motion through a
self-patterning in harmony with another body around it. (The entry on
 <a href="../margaret-cavendish/">Margaret Cavendish</a>
 provides a more detailed summary of Cavendish&rsquo;s account of
causation, along with guidance for further reading.) While
Cavendish&rsquo;s account of causation did not carry the day, vitalism
of one form or another was a dominant strand of thought in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is worth noting that vitalism
is also a position within contemporary philosophy of biology.</p>

<p>
A similar strategy for incorporating other women into the
philosophical canon can be deployed with respect to one or another
central topics such as the Principle of Sufficient Reason (Emilie du
Ch&acirc;telet 1740, 2009), or cosmology (Cavendish 1666a [1992],
1666b, Anne Conway (1690 [1996], Damaris Masham 1696, 2004, du
Ch&acirc;telet 1740, 2009; see Lascano 2019). Lascano (2023) develops
a comparative account of the metaphysical systems of Cavendish and
Conway, discussing their views on substance, monism, self-motion,
individuation, and identity over time, as well as causation,
perception, and freedom. The entry on
 <a href="../emilie-du-chatelet/">du Ch&acirc;telet</a>
 includes a helpful discussion on her position on the Principle of
Sufficient Reason, as well as an array of secondary sources. The
entries on
 <a href="../margaret-cavendish/">Cavendish</a>,
 <a href="../lady-masham/">Masham</a>
 and
 <a href="../emilie-du-chatelet/">du Ch&acirc;telet</a>
 provide some detail as to their positions on particular philosophical
topics.</p>

<p>
A number of recent edited volumes have instead focused on a particular
canonical philosophical theme and collected interpretations of a range
of women philosophers focused on that particular topic. Thomas (2018)
collects essays on women&rsquo;s contributions to early modern
metaphysics, with essays on metaphysics of science, ontology,
metaphysics of mind and self, and the metaphysics of morality, as well
as on the conception of metaphysics itself, covering such philosophers
as Damaris Masham, Cavendish, Emilie du Ch&acirc;telet, Bathsua Makin
and Anna Maria van Schurman, Anne Conway, Princess Elisabeth of
Bohemia, Mary Astell, Catherine Trotter Cockburn. Broad and Detlefsen
(2017) focuses on women&rsquo;s writings on liberty and freedom in the
early modern period, and includes essays on Cavendish, Masham,
Gabrielle Suchon, Cockburn, du Ch&acirc;telet, Catherine Macaulay,
Sophie de Grouchy, Mary Wollstonecraft. O&rsquo;Neill and Lascano
(2019) collects essays on women&rsquo;s contributions across three
broad thematic categories: metaphysics, epistemology and natural
philosophy; moral philosophy, moral psychology and philosophy of mind;
and social and political philosophy. (Note that while the majority of
essays in O&rsquo;Neill and Lascano&rsquo;s volume concern early
modern women thinkers, it is also includes women philosophers from
other historical periods.) These edited collections bring home that no
matter which canonical philosophical questions one finds interesting,
women philosophers made substantive contributions.</p>

<p>
One can also move to incorporate women into our philosophical history
by rethinking the questions through which that history is structured.
How the questions are framed influences who is taken to have
interesting answers on offer. Within the early modern period,
questions in epistemology are often about the nature of reason and
rationality, and the limits of the human understanding. While women of
the period sometimes address these questions theoretically, more often
they are concerned with implications of such answers for training the
human mind. For instance, many women are concerned with matters of
education, and they directly relate positions on education to
positions on the nature of human understanding and rationality, and
incorporate the passions into accounts of human understanding. Already
mentioned are the works of Anna Maria van Schurman (Schurman 1641,
1998) and Mary Astell (Astell 1694/1697 [2002]), but others including
Madeleine de Scud&eacute;ry (Scud&eacute;ry 1644, 2003, 2004), and
Gabrielle Suchon (Suchon 1693, 1700, 2010) also wrote on education
(Shapiro 2018). As part of their efforts to understand how we human
beings learn to reason, these philosophers also recognize that
reasoning is intimately connected with our emotional life: part of
reasoning well is feeling appropriately. Their discussions in which
learning to reason incorporates moral education resonate not only with
Spinoza <em>Ethics</em> (Parts 3&ndash;5) (1677) but also with Antoine
Arnauld and Pierre Nicole&rsquo;s <em>Logic, or Art of Thinking</em>
(1662) and Conway&rsquo;s account of metaphysical truth in her
<em>Principles</em> (1690). In these accounts, a philosophical
question emerges about how efforts to enable the exercise of human
freedom in rationality also rely on the very same customs and habits
that interfere with that freedom (Shapiro 2021). It would be
interesting to situate British sentimentalists such as Shaftesbury and
Hume with respect to these discussions. Catharine Macaulay, in her
<em>Letters on Education</em> (1790), argues that an education that
cultivates the sentiment of sympathy is essential to adults properly
grasping moral truths and being motivated to act on them (see Gordon
2025).</p>

<p>
While education is not today typically taken to be central to
philosophy, a little reflection on the history of philosophy can
destabilize this contemporary outlook. Descartes&rsquo;s <em>Discourse
on Method for Rightly Conducting Reason</em> (1637) is arguably a work
about education; John Locke wrote <em>Some Thoughts Concerning
Education</em> (1693) and <em>On the Conduct of the Understanding</em>
(1706); and Rousseau&rsquo;s <em>Emile</em> (1762) also concerns
education. Equally, education is a central concern of philosophers
predating the early modern period (consider Plato in
<em>Republic</em>) and after it (consider John Dewey (Dewey 1916)).
Reconsidering education as a central question of philosophy can not
only facilitate seeing women thinkers as contributing centrally to
philosophical projects but also bring to the fore philosophical
questions more recently fallen out of fashion but which have long been
compelling.</p>

<p>
Finally, there are philosophical discussions that quite simply were
central in the period, but which until recently have been largely
ignored. Arguments for the equality of the two sexes emerged in the
late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. While the so-called
<em>querelle des femmes</em>, or debate on women, had been going on
for centuries, the seventeenth century marked a turning point in the
debate over the status of women as better or worse than men in virtue
of their form or soul (see Kelly 1984, Deslauriers 2017). Both women
and men thinkers of the period advanced egalitarian arguments. So, for
instance, Marie De Gournay, in her &ldquo;On the Equality of Men and
Women&rdquo;, (1622 and 2002) deployed a skeptical method to argue for
the equality of men and women (De Gournay 2002); Anna Maria van
Schurman deployed syllogistic argumentation to argue for women&rsquo;s
education both by demonstration and as evidence in her
<em>Dissertatio</em> (1638) (van Schurman 1998); in her <em>Serious
Proposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their True and Greatest
Interest</em> (1694, 1697) Mary Astell applied Descartes&rsquo;s
sex-neutral account of the mind (insofar as mind is really distinct
from body, rationality is not tied to sex) to argue for women&rsquo;s
education (Astell 1694/1697 [2002]); Fran&ccedil;ois Poulain de la
Barre in <em>On the Equality of the Two Sexes</em> (1673) also drew on
Cartesian principles to argue for the social equality of men and women
(Poulain de la Barre 2002). (Clarke 2013 collects de Gournay, van
Schurman and Poulain de la Barre together.)</p>

<p>
These discussions are interesting for a number of reasons. First, they
highlight that philosophical questions of equality, and in a form of
particular interest to contemporary feminists, have a history. Though
anachronistic, it seems appropriate to characterize at least some of
these women, along with some of their male contemporaries, as engaged
in a feminist project, and conversely, that feminist arguments have a
history that long predates the late nineteenth century arguments for
women&rsquo;s suffrage. They thus highlight a new thematic thread for
the history of philosophy. Second, while the methods deployed by these
thinkers are different, they all appropriate on philosophical
methods&mdash;skepticism, basic rules of inference, a new
metaphysics&mdash;different from what was then the dominant
Aristotelian paradigm to counter misogynist claims. It is worth
considering the context in which these women were writing and what it
suggests about their feminist methodology in the history of
philosophy. Many of these thinkers were self-consciously countering a
recognized misogyny in philosophy, but insofar as they deployed
philosophical methods they would seem to reject the view that the
problem was intrinsic to the discipline of philosophy itself.</p>

<p>
At the same time as these strategies in retrieving the philosophy of
early modern women are proving successful, scholarship on the women
philosophers of other historical periods is emerging and gaining
momentum.</p>

<h3 id="WomMedPhi">2.2 Women in Medieval Philosophy</h3>

<p>
Scholars of medieval philosophy have finally achieved widespread
consensus that philosophy between the fourth and sixteenth centuries
can be found in any number of places that aren&rsquo;t simply texts
written by Christian men in the so-called &lsquo;Latin West&rsquo;.
Contemporary studies of European medieval philosophy thus increasingly
address Greek, Jewish, and Islamic texts in addition to the Latin
Christian &lsquo;canon&rsquo; (see Marenbon 2007; Hyman, Walsh, &amp;
Williams 2010; and Adamson 2019). Yet, on the whole, philosophical
scholarship continues to ignore female-authored texts from the Middle
Ages. The reason for this is simple, if pernicious: traditional
conceptions of medieval philosophy as taking place in monasteries,
religious schools, and university settings rule out the possibility of
women-authored texts because women were excluded from participating in
those settings in the Christian (both Latin and Greek), Islamic, and
Jewish worlds. (See Allen 2006 for a careful study of primary texts
justifying this exclusion as well as medieval responses to those
texts.)</p>

<p>
In the past decade, however, there has been increasing recognition
that the vast corpus of mystical and contemplative texts written by
women throughout Europe in the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries
contains much of philosophical interest. Here we provide three brief
examples of how medieval women engaged in central philosophical
debates of their time. In order to appreciate their contributions, it
is most helpful to take a topical rather than figure-based approach.
Given that scholastic authors cite only figures widely recognized as
authorities, women&rsquo;s names do not appear in their texts; since
women were excluded from university posts, we don&rsquo;t have the
sorts of records that allow us to trace the exchange of ideas and
views between specific university masters. If we take a topic-based
approach, however, we can place women&rsquo;s writings into the
general collage of developing views and important concepts. Our three
examples concern the following topics: Self-knowledge and
self-formation; reason&rsquo;s role in human life; and the
will&rsquo;s role in human life</p>

<p>
The importance of self-knowledge and self-formation for achieving the
ultimate end of human life was widely acknowledged in medieval
scholastic and contemplative/mystical discussions (see Cory 2014; Van
Dyke 2023). Whereas in scholastic texts discussions of self-knowledge
tend to focus on the possibility and mechanics of knowledge of self,
contemplative texts emphasize the ethical and spiritual motivations
for and results of such knowledge, with special attention paid to the
virtues that both arise from and facilitate it. Christine de Pizan [d.
1430], for instance, literally builds her City of Ladies on
self-knowledge, as the personification of Reason (who holds the mirror
of self-knowledge in lieu of a scepter) helps her lay the foundations
for the city&mdash;a city which then continues construction by
Rectitude and finally Justice (see particularly Part One, c. 1405
[1998]). A particularly important virtue for attaining self-knowledge
is humility, as Hadewijch [d. after 1250], Mechthild of Magdeburg [d.
1282], Marguerite Porete [d. 1310], and Catherine of Siena [d. 1380]
make clear (see Roberts 2009; Van Dyke 2018). Knowledge of self is
also frequently paralleled with knowledge of God, as when Julian of
Norwich [d. c. 1416] notes in her <em>Showings</em> that knowing
oneself is a pre-condition for knowing God, while at the same time
knowing God is necessary for full knowledge of oneself
(<em>Showings</em>, Long Text Chapter 56). Ultimately, medieval
contemplatives agree that self-knowledge forms the base for all future
moral and spiritual growth.</p>

<p>
The faculty of reason is crucial for acquiring self-knowledge, but
what role of reason should play in attaining our ultimate end was
hotly contested outside of as well as inside university settings. In
her early thirteenth century <em>Mirror of Simple Souls</em>, for
instance, Marguerite Porete advocates for the need to abandon human
rationality altogether in the later stages of our moral and spiritual
development (see Porete 1993, Chapter 87, where personified Reason
actually dies). At the same time, Hadewijch and Catherine of Siena
emphasize the importance of reason working together with will towards
our ultimate goal (see, e.g., Hadewijch 1980, Letters 10 and 18;
Catherine of Siena 1378 [1980], <em>Dialogue</em> Chapter 85). Julian
of Norwich portrays human rationality as sanctified via Christ&rsquo;s
incarnation, describing faith as coming from &ldquo;the natural love
of the soul, the clear light of reason, and the steadfast remembrance
God instilled in us when we were created&rdquo; (<em>Showings</em>,
Chapter 55). Finally, Hildegard of Bingen [d. 1179], Angela of Foligno
[d. 1309] and Margaret Ebner [d. 1351] go so far as to claim that
union with God has enhanced their natural rational capacities,
allowing them to comment with authority on Scripture and engage as
equals in discussions with learned men (see Hildegard of Bingen,
<em>Scivias</em> Preface; Angela di Foligno 2013 <em>Memoriale</em>
IX; Ebner <em>Revelations</em> 1993: 100).</p>

<p>
Debates about the primacy of the will and love in union with God are
also central to medieval contemplative/mystical as well as scholastic
texts, particularly in the late thirteenth-fifteenth centuries. The
will is one of the two faculties that human beings were said to share
with God (the other being intellect), and directing our wills towards
their proper object (God) was seen as the highest form of love. For
Marguerite Porete, the final stages of spiritual growth culminated in
such complete surrender of will that the self itself became
annihilated and only God remained (see J. M. Robinson 2001; King
2018.) Hadewijch, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Angela of Foligno, Catherine
of Siena, and Julian of Norwich also depict love as the most important
component of the moral and spiritual life, maintaining that love
increases knowledge in an upward spiral that negates the need for
formal university training. (The most famous expression of this view
is Thomas &agrave; Kempis&rsquo;s fifteenth century <em>Imitation of
Christ</em>, which is indebted to these earlier discussions.) Whether
our ultimate goal as human beings is to transcend our embodied
existence to merge selflessly with God&mdash;however that might
achieve&mdash;or whether our ultimate end is the fulfillment of human
nature in its individuality&mdash;and what this might
entail&mdash;remains controversial throughout the Middle Ages. Julian
of Norwich is, perhaps, the best example of someone who celebrates the
fulfillment of intellect and will in union with God without seeing
that union as erasing the individuality of human nature (see
<em>Showings</em>, Long Text).</p>

<h3 id="WomLatEigNinCenPhi">2.3 Women in Late Eighteenth and Nineteenth century Philosophy</h3>

<p>
Significant new work is underway to unearth the rich history of
women&rsquo;s philosophizing in both the German-speaking and
English-speaking worlds of the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and early
twentieth centuries. Recent work has shown that German women were
intentionally excluded from German histories of philosophy
(Ebbersmeyer 2020), and so despite these women thinkers having written
in the relatively recent past, they have already gone missing.
Scholars are now deploying the strategies that have been used
successfully in recovering the philosophical work of women in the
early modern period to identify women intellectuals whose work is
philosophical; recover their writings and make them accessible through
re-editions and translations; develop interpretations of their work
that takes care to highlight central philosophical themes they address
and situate these women with respect to canonical figures and
philosophical movements.</p>

<p>
Dyck 2021 provides a set of ground-breaking essays that highlight
women in eighteenth century and early nineteenth century German
philosophy. Essays document women&rsquo;s involvement in
Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy (Sophie of Hanover and Johanna
Charlotte Unzer), their contributions to the philosophy of education
(Dorothea Christiane Erxleben and Amalia Holst), their engagement with
Enlightenment debates (Wilhelmine of Bayreuth and Elise Reimarus) and
Kantianism (Maria von Herbert and Theodor von Hippel on the status of
women in Germany) as well as the legacy of German philosophy in the
nineteenth century, especially through the writings of French-Swiss
author Germaine de Sta&euml;l and American abolitionist Lydia Maria
Child. In his introduction to the volume, Corey Dyck distinguishes
among discussing women philosophers, women <em>in</em> philosophy, and
women <em>and</em> philosophy, drawing attention to questions about
what counts as philosophy and who counts as a philosopher both within
a particular historical context and contemporary conceptions of
philosophy.</p>

<p>
Kristin Gjesdal and Dalia Nassar have recently co-edited both a volume
of primary text translations by German women philosophers of the
nineteenth century, as well as an <em>Oxford Handbook of
Nineteenth-Century Philosophers in the German Tradition</em>, which
includes the first efforts of interpretive scholarship on many of
these figures. Women philosophers discussed in detail include Dorothea
von Schlegel, Rahel Varnhagen, Bettina von Arnim, Rosa Luxemburg,
Edith Landmann-Kalischer, and Edith Stein. The volume highlights
women&rsquo;s contributions to the philosophy of nature, philosophy of
science, philosophy of language, moral philosophy and aesthetics, as
well as Spinozism, pessimism, and empiricism. It details women&rsquo;s
participation in philosophical movements including Idealism,
Romanticism, Neo-Kantianism, and Phenomenology.</p>

<p>
Lydia Moland and Alison Stone have also recently co-edited a companion
<em>Oxford Handbook of American and British Women Philosophers in the
Nineteenth Century</em>. Individual women philosophers discussed
include Mary Shepherd on metaphysics, Ednah Dow Cheney on aesthetics,
Marietta Kies on moral philosophy, Mary Shelley on philosophizing
through literature, and E.E.C. Jones on the philosophy of language. In
the nineteenth century in the United States, Black women philosophers
such as Sojourner Truth, Anna Julia Cooper, Frances Watkins Harper,
and Maria Stewart also contributed substantially to philosophical
discussions. Women philosophers of the period in the English-speaking
world contributed not only to intellectual movements from socialism to
pragmatism to transcendentalism, but also directly to the
philosophical foundations of social movements, including those for
suffrage, abolition, pacifism, and the philosophy of education.</p>

<p>
Addressing the contributions of nineteenth-century African American
women to philosophy, though, not only entails identifying what
traditional philosophical topics or issues they engaged, but also how
they engaged them. Political and moral philosophy, and more
particularly natural law theory and its relation to theology and
Christian ethics, tend to constitute the traditional forms of
philosophy that they engaged, while embodied forms of rationality,
particularly in terms of race and gender as discussed by philosophers
Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze and Linda Mart&iacute;n Alcoff, constitute how
they engaged these topics (Eze 2008; Alcoff 2006). Race, however,
played a major role in both. Historian Joan Bryant recently argued
that race was a complicated phenomenon in nineteenth-century America
that went well beyond biological references, particularly for
nineteenth-century African-American male social reformers and thinkers
(Bryant 2024). As a set of &ldquo;disparate ideas and&hellip;assorted
practices&rdquo; that &ldquo;structured human difference, hierarchy,
sameness, and consciousness&rdquo; for these &ldquo;reluctant race
men&rdquo;, as she dubs them, race&rsquo;s complexity included a
slippage in meaning due to its many &ldquo;configurations&rdquo; and
&ldquo;functions&rdquo; (Bryant 2024: 327). As partners of these men,
nineteenth-century African-American female social reformers and
thinkers philosophized within the context of this complicated
phenomenon of race as well. However, the historical, social, and
political context in which these Black women philosophized still meant
dealing with the biological assumptions that Euro-Americans held about
them and their people, since these assumptions were first and foremost
about power and control.</p>

<p>
The prevalence of slavery and anti-Black racism in the United States
made the idea of a thinking, creative, and expressive Black
woman&mdash;much less one that could philosophize&mdash;foreign to
most Whites. Early attempts by anti-slavery advocates to demonstrate
that Blacks could be equal to Whites in reasoning and cultural
accomplishments were met with incredulity, even outright rejection.
Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s dismissal of Phillis Wheatley, an African
slave girl whose poetry was celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic
in the late eighteenth century, is exemplary of such incredulity and
rejection (Jefferson 1787 [1995:
 665]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 As philosopher Devonya Havis recently argued, though,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there was more at stake than a repudiation of her skill[;]&hellip; the
primary issue was that Wheatley represented a quintessential
disruption in the ideological restriction of the humanness of
Blackness. (2023: 78)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Black people were simply not human, or at least not in the same way as
Whites.</p>

<p>
Like Wheatley, then, nineteenth-century African-American women social
reformers and thinkers&mdash;such as Maria W. Stewart, Mary Ann Shadd
Cary, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and Anna Julia Hayward
 Cooper<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>&mdash;had
 first to defend themselves and their people as human beings with all
the abilities, feelings, and rights of Whites before they could defend
themselves as women. To this end, and &ldquo;from the standpoint of
their own experiences&rdquo;, to use philosopher Julie K. Ward&rsquo;s
apt phrasing, they demonstrated their abilities to philosophize by
&ldquo;synthesizing anew&rdquo; the discourses of freedom available to
them (Ward 1998: 80). This included the universal humanism in British
philosopher John Locke&rsquo;s natural law theory, which informed the
nation&rsquo;s founding documents, and the equality of all people in
the Hebraic and Christian scriptures, whose moral authority Locke used
to support his articulation of natural
 law.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 In other words, as Emmanuel Eze might put it, Stewart, Cary, Harper,
and Cooper &ldquo;reasoned vernacularly&rdquo; by re-constructing
philosophical and theological discourses on human being through their
experiences so that they might elicit shared moral judgments about
human being and human relations from their White audiences (Eze 2008:
xvi&ndash;xviii, 84&ndash;98, 125&ndash;129).</p>

<p>
The idea of human being that Stewart, Cary, Harper, and Cooper engaged
in the political philosophy grounding and informing the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution was the enlightened idea that Locke
had formulated in his <em>Essays on the Law of Nature</em> from the
1660s and elaborated in his <em>Two Treatises of Government</em> from
1689 and his <em>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> from 1690
(Jefferson 1776 [1995: 448&ndash;449]; Locke c.1660&ndash;1664 [1988];
Locke 1689 [2003: 261&ndash;387]; Locke 1764 [1952]; Locke 1706 [2004:
77&ndash;78, 83,
 316&ndash;321]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Locke maintained that an enlightened or liberal society, based on a
practical or empirical understanding of human being, as opposed to an
essential or metaphysical one, could be oriented around self-interest,
that is, as concern for one&rsquo;s material well-being, ongoing
betterment, and contentment, and as such, sanctioned by divine or
natural law and protected by government (Darwall 2023: 90&ndash;100;
Woolhouse 2007: 38, 339; Locke c. 1660&ndash;1664 [1988,
93&ndash;215]; Locke 1689 [2003: 261&ndash;309]; Locke 1764 [1952:
3&ndash;54). In 1776, a century after Locke published his <em>Essays
on the Law of Nature</em>, nearly a century after he published his
<em>Two Treatises of Government</em>, and nearly a century after many
English colonists had not only become familiar with Locke&rsquo;s
<em>Treatises</em>, but had also begun to appropriate his ideas of
human being and property in order to promote colonial expansion and
individual betterment (Arneil 1996: 168&ndash;187), Jefferson
presented this cluster of ideas in Locke&rsquo;s theory (along with
several others) in the soon-to-be famous lines of the Declaration of
Independence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness&mdash;That to secure these Rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of
the Governed&hellip;. (Jefferson 1776)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jefferson made Locke&rsquo;s practical idea of human being&mdash;a
rational being only motivated by self-interest&mdash;and Locke&rsquo;s
ethics based upon that idea&mdash;a divine command to function in this
way&mdash;the centerpiece of a new republic focused on human rights,
with a government focused on the protection of those rights and of
property (Darwall 2023: 90&ndash;100; Miller 1977 [1991: 14&ndash;18];
Arneil 1996: 187&ndash;194). As the &ldquo;pursuit of happiness&rdquo;
or the ability to create one&rsquo;s own empirical or material
well-being, ongoing betterment, and contentment included property in
African slaves for many of the founders&mdash;Jefferson included, in
spite of his promotion of liberty and denouncements of slavery, and in
spite of Locke&rsquo;s ultimate distancing of himself from
slavery&mdash;a parallel stream of anti-slavery arguments challenged
Locke&rsquo;s and especially Jefferson&rsquo;s positions, particularly
on religious and moral grounds (Jefferson 1776 [1995: 449]; Jefferson
1785 [1970: 91]; Jefferson 1786 [1970: 91&ndash;92]; Miller 1977
[1991: 38&ndash;45]; Locke c. 1670 [2003: 230]; Locke 1689 [2003:
272&ndash;274]; Locke 1764 [1952: 15&ndash;17]; Wootton 1993: 117;
Arneil 1996: 127; Uzgalis 1998: 49&ndash;77; Woolhouse 2007: 111, 187;
Moore 2023: 11, 146&ndash;165; M. C. Robinson
 2025).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
British thinkers such as the writer Samuel Johnson and Anglican divine
John Wesley critiqued Great Britain for the immorality and abuses that
slavery produced as part of the nation&rsquo;s unchecked expansionism
or pursuit of economic aspirations through colonizing ventures,
particularly as they negatively affected both persons of African
descent and Indigenous peoples (Moore 2023: 153&ndash;165; M. C.
Robinson 2025). It was social-reform and civic-minded Quakers, though,
who provided some of the most powerful and relentless challenges to
slavery and to Jefferson&rsquo;s adoption of Locke&rsquo;s philosophy
(Jordan 1968: 193&ndash;198, 271&ndash;294). In doing so, they
provided basic arguments that gave women like Stewart, Cary, Harper,
and Cooper an important entry into this conversation, particularly
through a close family member, friend, or formal education (Jordan
1968: 194&ndash;195, 272&ndash;276, 289&ndash;294; M. C. Robinson
2025). Following George Fox, the founder of Quakerism (Fox 1694 [1984:
57&ndash;125]), leading eighteenth-century Quakers such as John
Woolman, Anthony Benezet, and David Cooper acted on religious
conviction when they pointed out the violation of divine and natural
law, particularly in the glaring contradiction of championing freedom,
while robbing others of theirs (Jordan 1968: 194&ndash;198,
274&ndash;276, 289&ndash;292). In doing so, though, they were not so
much against self-interest per se, that is, as the pursuit of
one&rsquo;s material well-being and betterment, as they were against
the selfish self-centeredness that an excessive and unchecked
self-interest could foster (Jordan 1968: 274&ndash;276,
289&ndash;292).</p>

<p>
Maria W. Stewart, whom literary scholar Marilyn Richardson dubs
&ldquo;America&rsquo;s first Black woman political writer&rdquo;
(Richardson 1987a: iii), inherited and re-synthesized these arguments
in the context of her own and her people&rsquo;s experiences and in
light of her and her deceased husband&rsquo;s work with Black
revolutionary David Walker (Richardson 1987b: 5&ndash;21) by using the
revolutionary discourse of the founding documents and the same
passages from the book of Genesis that Locke had used to identify,
dignify, and validate White individuals, particularly White men
(Stewart 1831 [1987: 29&ndash;41]), as property producers. In the
process, she not only critiqued Whites like Locke and Jefferson for
&ldquo;keep[ing] Blacks &lsquo;down&rsquo;, &lsquo;while&rsquo; they
&lsquo;sit up yonder&rsquo;, acting as though they are &rsquo;better
than&rsquo; Blacks, all so that they might justify exploiting
&lsquo;the blood of our fathers &hellip; and the tears of our brethren
that have enriched [their] soils&rsquo;&rdquo; (Stewart 1831 [1987:
29, 40]; cf. Arneil 1996: 125&ndash;127; Locke c. 1670 [2003: 230]).
But she also encouraged, indeed, called, Black women and men to
&ldquo;CLAIM [THEIR] RIGHTS&rdquo;, even though they had long been
denied them (Stewart 1831 [1987: 40]). Ratcheting up the revolutionary
rhetoric, she even said to Black women, not just Black men, to
&ldquo;possess the spirit of men, bold and enterprising, fearless and
undaunted&rdquo; so that they might &ldquo;sue for their rights and
privileges&rdquo;, or at least &ldquo;know the reason [they] cannot
attain them&rdquo; so that they might be willing &ldquo;to die&rdquo;
to attain them (Stewart 1831 [1987: 38]).</p>

<p>
All of this rested upon Stewart&rsquo;s bold claim against conventions
of the time that Black men and women were endowed with the same
&ldquo;glorious image&rdquo; of God, presented in Genesis
1:26&ndash;27, as everyone else:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Many think, because your skins are &hellip; sable &hellip; that you
are an inferior race &hellip;, but God does not consider you as such.
He hath formed and fashioned you in his own glorious image, and hath
bestowed upon you reason and strong powers of intellect. He hath made
you to have dominion over the beasts of the field, the fowls of the
air, and the fish of the sea &hellip; and according to the
Constitution of these United States, he hath made all men free and
equal &hellip; It is not the color of the skin[, then,] that makes the
man, but &hellip; the principles formed within the soul. (Stewart 1831
[1987: 29])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, she not only claimed Locke&rsquo;s idea of human being
for Black people, but she also expanded upon it in Christian ethical
terms by saying that the person who possesses this image must be a
person of integrity, someone who will acknowledge, not abuse the image
of God in others, as they pursue their own material well-being and
contentment.</p>

<p>
Mary Ann Shadd Cary, whom media historian Jane Rhodes identifies as
the first Black woman newspaper editor and the second Black woman
lawyer, possessed the same radical spirit as Stewart (Rhodes 1998:
xi). Indeed, during her abolitionist career, when she focused on
enslaved Black women, Cary appealed to New Testament ethics,
particularly Jesus&rsquo;s summary of the commandments as &ldquo;love
of God and love of neighbor&rdquo; (Matthew 22:37&ndash;40;
Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18). Doing so, allowed her to identify
slavery as an &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and a &ldquo;sin&rdquo;&mdash;a
common abolitionist theme&mdash;that had particularly onerous effects
on Black women (Shadd Cary 1858 [2024: 65&ndash;69]). Like Stewart,
Cary also appreciated and appealed to the Lockean natural law theory
in the nation&rsquo;s founding documents. Indeed, her 1849 letter to
abolitionist Frederick Douglass, then the editor of the <em>North
Star</em>, confirms this, where she speaks of blacks becoming farmers
so that they could be &ldquo;producers &hellip; not merely &hellip;
consumers&rdquo; (Shadd Cary 1849 [2024: 25&ndash;26]). In her 1858
sermon, though, Cary was concerned to illuminate the selfishness that
could easily be validated in Locke&rsquo;s natural law theory,
especially as Jefferson and others had practiced it. Hence, following
the Quakers, she distinguished between natural law and what she took
to be &ldquo;the higher law&rdquo; of God&mdash;the aforementioned
love of God and neighbor (Shadd Cary 1858 [2024: 65&ndash;68]; Matthew
22:37&ndash;40). On her view, the improper implementation of natural
law in the actual laws of the United States had led to the sin of
slavery and with it the failure to acknowledge and respect the image
of God in Black people, especially Black women (Shadd Cary 1858 [2024:
66&ndash;68]). In the duty to love, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
law&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the higher law&rdquo;&mdash;challenges this
(Shadd Cary 1858 [2024, 68]).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We cannot successfully evade duty because the suffering fellow
&hellip; be only a <em>woman</em> She too is a neighbor &hellip; I
speak plainly because [we share] &hellip; a common origin and because
were it not for the monster slavery we could have a common destiny
here&mdash;in the land of our birth. (Shadd Cary 1858 [2024: 66,
67&ndash;68])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cary concluded, then, that &ldquo;the voice of woman&rdquo; must be
heard above all others since she is &ldquo;the greatest sufferer from
chattel slavery or political proscription&rdquo; (Shadd Cary 1858
[2024: 68]).</p>

<p>
In making these claims, Cary, like Stewart and the Quakers, was not
rejecting Jefferson&rsquo;s Lockean idea of divinely sanctioned
self-interest per se. She did not think that interest in one&rsquo;s
own material well-being, ongoing betterment, and contentment was
inherently selfish. She simply recognized that the founders&rsquo;
implementation of Locke&rsquo;s theory had expressed such selfishness
and led to the abuse and the exclusion of Black people, particularly
Black women. As a result, she viewed the divine commands to love God
and neighbor as a clear check on such selfishness. It defined the
integrity of which Stewart spoke that would make it impossible for
Whites who claimed to be Christians to ignore the image of God in
Black people, especially Black women. Like Stewart, then, Cary did not
merely reclaim Lockean natural law theory, but she made it clear that
it had to be informed and accompanied in practice by Christian ethics
so that it would not become ideological &ldquo;idolatry&rdquo; in the
hands of the powerful (V. Lloyd 2016: x&ndash;xi). If White men like
Locke and Jefferson were going to appeal to the Bible, they needed to
be ready to abide by its New Testament ethics.</p>

<p>
Abolitionist poet, educator, and all-around social reformer Frances
Ellen Watkins Harper agreed. Like Cary and Stewart, she too fought for
the rights of Blacks by focusing on Black women. And like Cary and
Stewart, she did so out of religious conviction. But, as intellectual
historian Marcia Robinson explains, Harper took a slightly different
approach to the natural law theory in the nation&rsquo;s founding
documents and Christianity&rsquo;s relationship to it (M. C. Robinson
 2024).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Harper did not simply use religious and moral ideals to check the
abuses of Jefferson&rsquo;s Lockean self-interest as Cary and Stewart
did (Harper 1893 [1988: 216&ndash;225]). But she also took issue with
the very idea that the creation myths in Genesis 1&ndash;3 could be
used, as Locke had used them, to interpret human beings almost
exclusively as self-interested property producers. That is, Harper
took issue with the way that Jefferson and the other founders had
deliberately excluded slavery from the Declaration of Independence,
thereby failing to address and to denounce it precisely where they,
following Locke, drew upon the Bible (Harper 1859a [1990:
47&ndash;48]; Harper 1893 [1988: 218, 224&ndash;225])&mdash;namely,
where Jefferson re-presents Locke&rsquo;s &ldquo;unalienable
rights&rdquo; of &ldquo;life, liberty, and property&rdquo; as
&ldquo;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&rdquo;, as
historian John Chester Miller and political scientist Barbara Arneil
reveal (Jefferson 1776 [1995: 449]; Miller 1977 [1991: 12&ndash;18];
Arneil 1996: 191). As a result, Harper faulted them for saddling the
new republic with a host of injustices, abuses, and social problems
from the start, including the ongoing theft of Indigenous lands and
the exploitation and abuse of Black women (Harper 1859a [1990:
47&ndash;48]; Harper 1893 [1988: 61&ndash;72, 134, 146&ndash;147,
216&ndash;236]). Her primary concern, then, was not simply to
challenge the excesses and abuses of Whites&rsquo; self-interest so
that Black people could gain access to the same rights and privileges
of American citizenship as Whites, even though she too was concerned
about this (Harper 1859b [1990: 103&ndash;104]). Rather,
Harper&rsquo;s fundamental concern was the kind of human relations and
human society that the nation&rsquo;s ideals, based on human being in
the image of God and elaborated by Jesus&rsquo;s love ethic,
portended. Those relations, she maintained, should not only define and
facilitate a multi-racial democracy in the United States, but they
should also influence the actions of the nation&rsquo;s people at all
times and in every sphere&mdash;economic, political, social, cultural,
and especially religious (Harper 1859b [1990: 103&ndash;104]).</p>

<p>
In taking this position, Harper recognized that even before slavery
had been abolished, free Black people like herself, who were aspiring
to be part of the nation&rsquo;s middle class, were also inclined to
adopt the position of the property producer in America&rsquo;s
slaveholding, overly commercialized society. They believed, she
maintained, that &ldquo;money&rdquo; was &ldquo;a symbol of
power&rdquo; that could &ldquo;gain for&rdquo; them &ldquo;the
rights&rdquo; that &ldquo;power and prejudice&rdquo; had
&ldquo;denied&rdquo; them (Harper 1859b [1990: 103]). She immediately
saw the error in this belief. &ldquo;It is no honor&rdquo;, she
reminded her fellow Black men and women seeking wealth, &ldquo;to
shake hands politically with&rdquo; wealthy White men and women
&ldquo;who whip&rdquo; Black &ldquo;women and steal&rdquo; Black
&ldquo;babies&rdquo; (Harper 1859b [1990: 104]). In other words, she
basically told them that they could earn all the money they wanted,
but that would not earn them the respect that they sought nor improve
the lot of their enslaved people. &ldquo;The important lesson we
should learn&rdquo;, she proclaimed,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is how to make every gift, whether &hellip; fortune or genius,
subserve the cause of crushed humanity and carry out the greatest idea
of the present age, the glorious idea of human brotherhood. (Harper
1859b [1990: 104])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, for Harper, the true idea of America, as implied by
those &ldquo;unalienable rights&rdquo; based on the image of God, was
the potential of and the call to right human relations. Material
well-being and contentment were secondary. The government&rsquo;s
task, however, was to protect both.</p>

<p>
Educator and activist Anna Julia Cooper expanded, indeed, went well
beyond Harper&rsquo;s, Cary&rsquo;s, and Stewart&rsquo;s positions, as
scholars Louise Daniel Hutchinson, Leona C. Gabel, Frances Richardson
Keller; Vivian M. May, and Vincent W. Lloyd all reveal in their
respective interpretations of Cooper (Hutchinson 1981; Gabel 1982; F.
R. Keller 2006; May 2007 [2012]; V. Lloyd 2016). To start, Cooper
received a formal education that allowed her to earn both a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a doctorate (Cooper 1892 [1988:
76&ndash;78]; Hutchinson 1981: 3&ndash;43, 131&ndash;143; Gabel 1982:
12&ndash;24, 60&ndash;69). As part of qualifying for the latter,
Cooper wrote a dissertation at the Sorbonne that took France&rsquo;s
leading figures to task for failing to recognize the humanity of Black
slaves in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), even as they championed
the republican ideals of freedom, brotherhood, and equality (<em lang="fr">libert&eacute;,
fraternit&eacute;,
egalit&eacute;</em>)&mdash;another expression of the natural law
tradition, indeed one directly connected to the American natural law
tradition (Cooper 1925 [2006]). As feminist scholar Vivian May
maintains, Cooper used both critical analysis to interrogate French
political and economic history and dialectical and intersectional
reasoning to point out the way in which wealthy French men&rsquo;s
&ldquo;pursuits of happiness&rdquo;, to use Jefferson&rsquo;s phrase
(Jefferson 1776 [1995: 449]), ultimately became not only a rejection
of the humanity of Black people in France&rsquo;s former colony (May
2007 [2012]: 110&ndash;139 [ch. 4]), but also a means for her to
develop what would ultimately become &ldquo;the key terms of
today&rsquo;s dependency theory of global political economy&rdquo;
(May 2007 [2012]: 110 [ch. 4]).</p>

<p>
Cooper also expanded, refined, and deepened the way that Black women
could think about human being, particularly in terms of what might
best constitute &ldquo;the pursuit of happiness&rdquo;, which made her
both akin to and different from Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin, as
historian Peter Moore elaborates this idea (Cooper 1892 [1988: 12];
Jefferson 1776 [1995: 449]; Moore 2023: 11). Key to her thinking was
French feminist Germaine de Sta&euml;l and her romantic idea of the
self, which accords with Cooper&rsquo;s own dialectical idea of the
American experiment (Cooper 1892 [1988: 12, 149&ndash;174];
Berg&egrave;s 2025). Following de Sta&euml;l, Cooper maintained
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
happiness&hellip;consists not in perfections attained, but in a sense
of progress, the result of our own endeavor under conspiring
circumstances <em>toward</em> a goal which continually advances and
broadens and deepens till it is swallowed up in the Infinite. (Cooper
1892 [1988: 12])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Happiness&rdquo;, for her, was not in the attainment of any
particular &ldquo;endeavor&rdquo;, but rather in the sense of
betterment that comes with striving itself, that is, with striving
towards something unbounded or eternal that defines the human subject
as human and so is able ultimately to fulfill it. Hence, unlike most
of the nation&rsquo;s founders, not to mention most Americans, Cooper
did not reduce &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; to the pursuit of material gain
and pleasure. Rather, she grounded it in the potential fulfillment of
the human subject&rsquo;s active spiritual, moral, and creative power
in a state of being that has no bounds. This makes Cooper&rsquo;s idea
of the self akin not only to de Sta&euml;l&rsquo;s endlessly
developing self, but also to other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
philosophical ideas of the self&mdash;and a long Platonic tradition in
Christianity&mdash;something Jefferson may well have appreciated in
his more generous moments.</p>

<p>
For Cooper, as well as for Harper, Cary, and Stewart, then, the idea
of America was the idea of human potential itself&mdash;morally,
spiritually, creatively, politically, and/or economically
conceived&mdash;for each of them participated in an ongoing national
conversation about this potential, typically framed in terms of the
meaning of America and taking place in a variety of public venues.
Being part of such a wide-ranging conversation was not merely an
academic affair. Their own and their people&rsquo;s future rested upon
its viability.</p>

<h3 id="HisQue">2.4 Historiographical Questions</h3>

<p>
These efforts to recover the women philosophers of the past and their
works raise a number of historiographical questions. First, and
foremost, it challenges us to think about how we arrived at the
historical philosophical canon that we have, in ways that move beyond
the discussion in the contributions to (Rorty, Schneewind, and Skinner
1984). Recent work by Sabrina Ebbersmeyer (2020) and by Delphine
Antoine-Mahut (2020) shows how political agendas have figured in the
telling of philosophical history in Germany and France. In these
histories, certain philosophical topics rose to the fore, while others
were discounted. But in discounting the value of a set of
philosophical themes, these canonical histories of philosophy have
also shaped the dynamics of contemporary philosophical discussions,
privileging some topics rather than others, just as much they
privilege some figures. This recovery work asks us to cast a critical
lens on the philosophical topics we take to be central (Shapiro 2016).
Second, recovering the philosophical work of women requires an
openness to the genres of writing proper to philosophy. Work in
medieval philosophy shows that women used genres of spiritual writing
to advance their philosophical ideas. In early modern period, women
used polemics, poetry, novels, plays, school curricula, as well as
treatises, to articulate their philosophy, and this use of a range of
genres, as well as publicly circulated forms of expression such as
pamphlets, newspapers and journals to engage in philosophical
discussion. Attending the variety of genres of philosophical writing
raises questions about the boundaries of philosophy as a discipline.
Questions about how to demarcate philosophical work also arise in
noticing that many women&rsquo;s philosophical work aims to directly
influence public opinion, for instance, about the equality of men and
women, and indeed of all human beings, and about the social and
political implications of that equality, including the need for and
structure of educational institutions, the immorality of slavery, and
the right to political representation through voting. What is the
relation between the philosophical work done in formal academic
environments and that done in the public sphere? Much of the work of
recovering the philosophical work of women of the past has been
focused squarely on the European and Anglophone philosophical
traditions. This focus invites questions about how the exclusion of
women from the history of philosophy intersects with the exclusion of
others, and in particular Africana philosophers, and other
philosophical traditions from the history of European philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="FemAppCanPhi">3. Feminist Appropriation of Canonical Philosophers</h2>

<p>
Feminist philosophers are also changing the history of philosophy by
appropriating its ideas for feminist purposes. From the perspective of
feminist critique of the traditional canon, the history of philosophy
is a resource only in so far as it describes the theories and thinkers
that were most deeply in error. Other feminist historians of
philosophy have found important resources for feminism in canonical
philosophers. Indeed, they have found valuable concepts even in the
worst offenders of the negative canon, like Aristotle and
Descartes.</p>

<p>
For example, in <em>The Fragility of Goodness</em> Martha Nussbaum has
described the virtues of an Aristotelian ethics with its emphasis on
the importance of concrete context, emotion, and care for others in an
ethical life (Nussbaum 1986). And Marcia Homiak has argued that
Aristotle&rsquo;s rational ideal, far from being antithetical to
feminists, actually captures some of feminism&rsquo;s deepest ethical
insights (Homiak 1993). With regard to Descartes, Margaret Atherton
has argued that his concept of reason was interpreted in egalitarian
rather than masculinist terms by several women philosophers of the
eighteenth century, and was used in their arguments for equal
education for
 women.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Other feminists have urged the reconsideration of the views of
canonical figures, from Hume to Dewey. &nbsp;For example, Annette
Baier has argued at length for the value of a Humean perspective in
both epistemology and in ethics for feminist theory (Baier 1987,
1993). And, in <em>Pragmatism and Feminism</em> Charlene Seigfried
argues for the value of pragmatism for feminism; a position also taken
by Richard Rorty (Seigfried 1996; Rorty 1991). Feminists have used the
strategy of appropriation with a wide range of philosophers including
Hegel (Mills 1996), Foucault (Hekman 1996), Kierkegaard ((L&eacute;on
and Walsh 1997), and Derrida (Holland 1997).</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that some of the very same philosophers who
were cast as the villains of the traditional canon are also mined by
feminist theorists for useful ideas. Indeed, it is likely that every
philosopher, from Plato to Nietzsche, who has been subject to feminist
criticism, also appears in some feminist&rsquo;s good books. This is
perplexing. After all, if feminists evaluate canonical texts so
differently, it raises questions about the coherence of feminist
interpretations of texts. Is Aristotle a feminist hero or villain? Are
Descartes&rsquo; ideas dangerous for feminists or useful to them? If
feminists have argued both positions, we begin to suspect that there
is no such thing as a feminist interpretation of a philosopher. And
this might lead us to wonder about the coherence and unity of the
project of feminist canon revision.</p>

<p>
Why is it that feminist philosophers have reached different, and even
sometimes incompatible interpretations of the history of philosophy?
One answer is that the multiple and contrary readings of the
philosophical canon by feminists reflects the contested nature of the
&ldquo;us&rdquo; of contemporary feminism. The fact that feminist
interpretations of canonical figures is diverse reflects, and is a
part of, on-going debates within feminism over its identity and
self-image. Disagreements among feminist historians of philosophy over
the value of canonical philosophers, and the appropriate categories to
use to interpret them, are, in the final analysis, the result of
debate within feminist philosophy over what feminism is, and what is
theoretical commitments should be, and what its core values are.</p>
