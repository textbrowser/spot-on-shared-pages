<div id="preamble">

<p>
At least in anglophone countries, Spinoza&rsquo;s reputation as a
political thinker is eclipsed by his reputation as a rationalist
metaphysician. Nevertheless, Spinoza was a penetrating political
theorist whose writings have enduring significance. In his two
political treatises, Spinoza advances a number of forceful and
original arguments in defense of democratic governance, freedom of
thought and expression, and the subordination of religion to the
state. On the basis of his naturalistic metaphysics, Spinoza also
offers trenchant criticisms of ordinary conceptions of right and duty.
And his account of civil organization stands as an important
contribution to the development of constitutionalism and the rule of
law.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="HisBac">1. Historical Background</h2>

<p>
To appreciate the significance of Spinoza&rsquo;s political
philosophy, we must situate it in its particular theologico-political
context as well as its broader intellectual context.</p>

<h3 id="ThePolBac">1.1 Theological and Political Background</h3>

<p>
Despite being one of the most tolerant countries in early-modern
Europe&mdash;a sanctuary for free thinkers and members of religious
minorities&mdash;the United Provinces were riven by religious
conflict, as the Dutch sought to establish their identity after
gaining independence from Spain. The confessional rifts of the
seventeenth century were an important part of context in which Spinoza
composed his <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</em> [hereafter:
TTP].</p>

<p>
The early decades of the seventeenth century were marked by a deep
religious schism that took on political import. In 1610, forty-four
followers of liberal theologian Jacobus Arminius wrote a formal
&ldquo;Remonstrance&rdquo; that articulated the ways in which they
broke with orthodox Calvinism. These Arminians, or Remonstrants, as
they came to be known, defended religious toleration on the grounds
that faith concerns only the conscience of the individual and so is
not subject to the coercive power of the state. The Remonstrants were
opposed by conservative Gomarists (followers of Franciscus Gomarus),
or so-called &ldquo;Counter-Remonstrants&rdquo;. For a little over a
decade (roughly 1607&ndash;1618), the dispute raged on, expanding
outward from Holland and Utrecht. In 1618, a national synod (the Synod
of Dort) convened to define the public faith more explicitly. The
fallout from the Synod of Dort was disastrous for the tolerant
Arminians. The Advocate of the States of Holland, Johan
Oldenbarnevelt, a staunch defender of the Remonstrants, was put to
death. And Arminians were purged from town councils and universities
throughout the republic (Israel 1995).</p>

<p>
The middle of the century witnessed its own major theologico-political
dispute in the United Provinces. Once again, at the center of the
dispute were two theologians: Johannes Cocceius, a liberal theology
professor at the University of Leiden, and Gisbertus Voetius, Dean of
the University of Utrecht. Disputes between Cocceians and Voetians
began over abstruse theological matters, but expanded into a larger
political and cultural affair. The Voetians led an assault on the
Cartesian philosophy taught in the universities. They thought that the
new science advocated by Descartes, with its mechanistic view of the
material world, posed a threat to Christianity (Nadler 1999 [2018]).
This episode, like the earlier theological crisis, shows that the
freedom of philosophizing remained under perpetual threat even in this
relatively tolerant republic.</p>

<p>
Spinoza was no stranger to this threat. Growing up as a member of
Amsterdam&rsquo;s Jewish community, Spinoza was under the careful
watch of rabbinical authorities who notoriously cast him out of this
community in 1656 for his &ldquo;abominable heresies&rdquo; and
&ldquo;monstrous deeds&rdquo;. While Spinoza apparently endured this
<em>cherem</em> (roughly: excommunication) with characteristic
equanimity, fellow Dutch apostate Jew, Uriel da Costa, was unable to
bear the indignity of a similar fate. In 1640&mdash;when Spinoza was
only eight years old&mdash;da Costa, was the target of a
<em>cherem</em> for denying the immortality of the soul and
challenging the status of the Torah as divine revelation. Da Costa
took his own life shortly after being ignominiously readmitted
(according to one account, he was forced to lie at the threshold of
the synagogue where congregants tread upon him while exiting).</p>

<p>
The da Costa affair surely made a lasting impression on Spinoza, but
it did not affect him as personally as the treatment of his friend
Adriaan Koerbagh at the hands of Dutch authorities. In 1668 Koerbagh
published two treatises that provoked the wrath of the Calvinist
clergy. In the more scandalous of the two&mdash;<em>Een Bloemhof van
allerley lieflijkheyd</em> (A Flower Garden of all Kinds of
Loveliness)&mdash;Koerbagh ridiculed several traditional religious
doctrines and practices, and, in the process, articulated his own
religious and metaphysical views. Among the shocking views that he
advanced were that Jesus is not divine, that God is identical with
nature, that everything is necessitated by the laws of nature (the
laws of God), and that miracles are impossible. These are all
positions that Spinoza endorsed. However, while Spinoza was famously
cautious, Koerbagh was not, publishing the works in Dutch (thereby
making them accessible to the general literate public) under his own
name. Koerbagh was tried and sentenced on charges of blasphemy. During
his subsequent imprisonment under squalid conditions Koerbagh became
ill. He died soon thereafter, in 1669. It is generally supposed that
Koerbagh&rsquo;s imprisonment and death precipitated the publication
of the TTP (Nadler 1999 [2018]).</p>

<p>
Things would only get worse for liberal republicans like Spinoza. In
1672, the so-called &ldquo;disaster year&rdquo; (<em>rampjaar</em>),
French troops under the command of Louis XIV invaded the United
Provinces, capturing several Dutch cities. Grand Pensionary (chief
statesman and legal advisor) Johan de Witt shouldered much of the
blame for this military embarrassment. De Witt was the leader of the
States of Holland for much of the republican period that followed the
death of Stadholder William II in 1650. After the French invasion, the
stadholdership (a quasi-monarchical post) was reinstituted in the
person of William III, and de Witt was forced to resign. Shortly
afterward he and his brother Cornelis were brutally killed by a
zealous mob. This incident evoked uncommon outrage in Spinoza, a
supporter of de Witt and the republican ideals for which he stood.
According to one famous account, Spinoza had to be restrained by his
landlord from taking a sign reading <em>ultimi barbarorum</em>
[&ldquo;ultimate of barbarians&rdquo;] to the site of the massacre
(Freudenthal 1899: 201). Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus Politicus</em>
[Hereafter: TP] was composed in the aftermath of, and perhaps prompted
in part by, the events of 1672.</p>

<h3 id="IntBac">1.2 Intellectual Background</h3>

<p>
In terms of the broader intellectual background to Spinoza&rsquo;s
political thought, Thomas Hobbes figures prominently (for a recent
comparative study, see Field 2020). Spinoza&rsquo;s work in
relationship to Hobbes&rsquo;s will be discussed in some detail below
 (<a href="#HobSpiRigNat">&sect;2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#HobSpiObl">&sect;2.2</a>,
 below). It is important to mention the impact of Dutch Hobbesians on
Spinoza. Hobbesian thought was introduced into Dutch political
discourse by Lambert van Velthuysen, an anti-clerical, liberal
physician (Tuck 1979; Blom 1995). Velthuysen&rsquo;s
<em>Dissertatio</em> is an unabashed defense of Hobbes&rsquo;s
thought, in which the duty to preserve oneself is given pride of place
(see esp. &sect;13). Spinoza read Velthuysen and admired him as a
&ldquo;man of exceptional sincerity of mind&rdquo;, and he was thus
disconcerted when Velthuysen denounced the TTP as the work of a
dangerous atheist (Epistles 42 and 43).</p>

<p>
Aside from Velthuysen, the other primary Dutch conduits for Hobbesian
thought prior to Spinoza were the De la Court brothers, Pieter and
Johan (Petry 1984; Kossmann 2000). The De la Courts were ardent
republicans who maintained good relations with Johan de Witt. Indeed,
de Witt is thought to have written two chapters in the second edition
of their book <em>Interest van Holland</em> (see Petry 1984). The De
la Courts accepted the basic features of Hobbesian anthropology, while
eschewing juridical concepts like &ldquo;right&rdquo; and
&ldquo;contract&rdquo; (see Malcolm 1991), opting instead to analyze
the civil condition in terms of the competing interests of
participants. According to them, the aim of the state is to ensure
that the interests of rulers are tied to the interests of the ruled,
which is possible only if one adopts a series of institutional
measures, including blind balloting, the removal of hereditary posts,
and the rotation of offices. Republics, they argued, are marked by
greater checks against self-interested legislation than monarchies
(see Blom 1993). Spinoza evidently read these works carefully, and his
institutional recommendations in the TP reflect a debt to the De la
Courts (Petry 1984; Haitsma Mulier 1980).</p>

<p>
It might well have been the writings of the De la Courts that
impressed upon Spinoza the perspicacity of Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli.
The notion of balancing the interests of competing parties was
ultimately derived from Machiavelli (Haitsma Mulier 1991; Del Lucchese
2004 [2009]). Spinoza&rsquo;s TP is shot through with Machiavellian
insights and recommendations. Right at the outset of the work, Spinoza
parrots Machiavelli&rsquo;s critique of utopian theorizing, elevating
statespeople over philosophers, since only the former begin with a
realistic conception of human psychology (TP 1.1; cf. Machiavelli,
<em>The Prince</em> I.15). Machiavellian realism pervades
Spinoza&rsquo;s political writings, playing a particularly significant
role in the constitutional theorizing of the TP.</p>

<h2 id="BasFeaSpiPolPhi">2. Basic Features of Spinoza&rsquo;s Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Spinoza&rsquo;s commitment to metaphysical naturalism, according to
which all things act in accordance with the pervasive, immutable, and
non-teleological laws of nature (<em>E</em>III Preface), forms an
important part of the backdrop of Spinoza&rsquo;s political
philosophy. It leads him to reject traditional (Thomistic or
Protestant) natural law theory, which is predicated on a natural
normative order of things (discernible by right reason) distinct from
the actual order of things. According to traditional natural law
theory, humans act contrary to nature when they act contrary to the
precepts of right reason. Spinoza skewers this view, according to
which &ldquo;the ignorant disturb the order of nature rather than
follow it&rdquo;, claiming that it implies that humans are &ldquo;a
dominion within a dominion [<em>imperium in imperio</em>]&rdquo; (TP
2.6). Against this view, Spinoza insists that all human action, no
matter how irrational, follows from the &ldquo;laws and rules of
nature&rdquo; (TP 2.5). This is, arguably, a direct rebuke of the
natural law tradition (see Curley 1991; Steinberg 2018a: Ch. 2; but
see Miller 2012 and A. Garrett 2003 for different assessments).</p>

<h3 id="HobSpiRigNat">2.1 Hobbes and Spinoza on the Right of Nature</h3>

<p>
Spinoza&rsquo;s naturalism profoundly shapes his views of right and
obligation, which can be illuminated through a contrast with
Hobbes.</p>

<p>
One of the most notorious features of Spinoza&rsquo;s political
thought is his account of natural right. He introduces this concept in
TTP 16, where he boldly writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By the right and established practice of nature I mean nothing but the
rules of the nature of each individual, according to which we conceive
each thing to be naturally determined to existing and having effects
in a certain way. For example, fish are determined by nature to
swimming, and the large ones to eating the smaller. So it is by the
supreme right of nature that fish are masters of the water, and that
the large ones eat the smaller. For it&rsquo;s certain that nature,
considered absolutely, has the supreme right to do everything it can,
i.e., that the right of nature extends as far as its power does. For
the power of nature is the power of God itself, and he has the supreme
right over all things. But the universal power of the whole of nature
is nothing but the power of all individuals together. From this it
follows that each individual has a supreme right to do everything it
can, or that the right of each thing extends as far as its determinate
power does. (TTP 16.2&ndash;4; cf. TP 2.4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In claiming that the right of nature is coextensive with the power of
nature and that this applies <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to individuals
in nature, Spinoza is rejecting a moral conception of right, rather
than making a positive normative claim (for a careful analysis of this
passage, see Grey 2021). So although Spinoza is sometimes presented as
subscribing to the view that &ldquo;might makes right&rdquo; (Barbone
&amp; Rice 2000; McShea 1968), in fact he is not so much advancing a
normative claim of right as denying the existence of normative rights
(see Curley 1996; Balibar 1985 [1998]). Consequently, even if
Spinoza&rsquo;s account implies that Cort&eacute;s conquered the
Aztecs by right, it does not follow that it was the right, proper, or
best thing to do (see TP 5.1 and TTP 20.6&ndash;7; see
 <a href="#SpiNor">&sect;2.3</a>).
 Actions are good only insofar as they empower (see, e.g., E4p8d), but
one can perfectly well do things&mdash;and so, according to the
reasoning above, do things by right&mdash;that are in fact
disempowering (to be sure, though, these do not count as actions in
the strict sense laid out in the <em>Ethics</em> of producing effects
from one&rsquo;s nature alone [E3D1&ndash;3]).</p>

<p>
Spinoza&rsquo;s account of natural right is often regarded as broadly
Hobbesian. And yet there are important differences. Hobbes&rsquo;s
account of natural right changed somewhat between his early political
writings and <em>Leviathan</em>. In <em>De Cive,</em> for instance,
Hobbes defines right as &ldquo;the liberty each man has of using his
natural faculties in accordance with right reason&rdquo; (DCv 1.7).
Natural right is the liberty to do anything consistent with the
natural law (DCv 2.1), including the liberty to do anything that one
judges to be necessary for one&rsquo;s preservation (DCv
1.8&ndash;1.9). Hobbes adds a proviso here, namely that one must
<em>sincerely</em> believe that the act contributes to one&rsquo;s
preservation (DCv 1.10n). Consequently, since &ldquo;drunkenness and
cruelty&rdquo; cannot sincerely be thought to contribute to
self-preservation, drunken and cruel actions are not performed by
right, even in the state of nature (DCv 3.27).</p>

<p>
In <em>Leviathan</em>, Hobbes seems to jettison these normative
constraints (for the &ldquo;de facto&rdquo; turn in Hobbes&rsquo;s
thought, see Hoekstra 2004 and Field 2014). But this does not mean
that he disavows a normative conception of right. On the contrary, the
concept of right as an alienable title is absolutely essential to his
account of the formation of sovereign authority in <em>Leviathan.</em>
Spinoza seizes on this distinction in his response to Jarig
Jelles&rsquo;s question of how his view differs from Hobbes. He
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As far as Politics is concerned, the difference you ask about, between
Hobbes and me, is this: I always preserve natural Right unimpaired,
and I maintain that in each State the Supreme Magistrate has no more
right over its subjects than it has greater power over them. (Epistle
50)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On Spinoza&rsquo;s thoroughgoingly naturalistic account, natural right
is not a title that can be given away. It is&mdash;or is coextensive
with&mdash;one&rsquo;s power. Still, Spinoza does allow for a sense in
which one can cede right to another and even seems to adopt his own
version of a social contract in the TTP. We will consider below
 (<a href="#SocConTTP">&sect;3.6</a>)
 how his conception of a social contract, and the transfer or
cessation of right on which it depends, can be made compatible with
his strict naturalism about right.</p>

<h3 id="HobSpiObl">2.2 Hobbes and Spinoza on Obligation</h3>

<p>
The difference between Hobbes and Spinoza on right bears directly on
their distinct accounts of obligation. Hobbes thinks that we incur
binding obligations when we make pledges under the appropriate
conditions. By contrast, Spinoza maintains that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a contract can have no force except by reason of its utility. If the
utility is taken away, the contract is taken away with it, and remains
null and void. (TTP 16.20; cf. TP 2.12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Elsewhere, he clarifies that the validity of an agreement depends not
so much on utility as <em>perceived</em> utility, proceeding to argue
that since men are psychologically bound to choose what appears to be
the greater good or lesser evil, it would be absurd to claim that they
have an obligation to do otherwise.</p>

<p>
By adhering to a strict naturalism about right and obligation and
maintaining that &ldquo;the sovereign power in a State has right over
a subject only in proportion to the excess of its power over that of a
subject&rdquo; (Epistle 50), Spinoza places the burden of political
stability on the sovereign rather than the subject (see Wernham 1958).
The commonwealth must be structured so as to promote compliance; and
where there is excessive vice or non-compliance, this is to be
&ldquo;imputed to the Commonwealth&rdquo; (TP 5.3). And if a sovereign
is to maintain its right, it must legislate wisely, so as not to rouse
the indignation of the people (TP 3.9). Arguably, then, while Spinoza
does not accord to the people a proper right of revolution, he
proposes a naturalistic equivalent, since the right of the state is
essentially constituted, and consequently limited, by the power of the
people (TP 2.17) (see Sharp 2013).</p>

<p>
Thus, when Spinoza points to the differences between his view of
natural right and Hobbes&rsquo;s in his letter to Jelles, differences
that might seem negligible to the casual reader, he is identifying a
significant break. Spinoza&rsquo;s naturalism leads him to reject the
Hobbesian distinction between the artificial civil state and the state
of nature, as well as the notion of a notion of (non-prudential)
obligation that arises with the construction of the commonwealth. But
given his repudiation, or at least radical revision, of rights and
obligations as traditionally understood, one might be left wondering
how or even whether Spinoza could offer a normative political theory
at all.</p>

<h3 id="SpiNor">2.3 Spinoza and Normativity</h3>

<p>
Lest one think that Spinoza&rsquo;s accounts of right and obligation
eliminate any basis for normative evaluations of political affairs, he
clarifies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It&rsquo;s&hellip;one thing to defend oneself, to preserve oneself,
make a judgment, etc., by right, and another to defend oneself,
preserve oneself, and make a judgment in the best way. (TP 5.1; cf.
TTP 20.6&ndash;7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The goodness or badness of an action in political affairs, as in
ethics, is determined by how the action affects a thing&rsquo;s
striving or one&rsquo;s power (see <em>E</em>IVP18S; TP 2.8; TTP
16.10). Things are good for a state to the extent that they conduce to
the power of the people as a corporate whole. And from the perspective
of the individual subject, the state can be judged to be good,
fulfilling its purpose as it were (see
 <a href="#Dem">&sect;4.3</a>),
 to the extent that it liberates or empowers.</p>

<h2 id="TraThePol">3. The <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</em></h2>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="#ThePolBac">&sect;1.1</a>,
 the United Provinces were torn apart in the seventeenth century by
disputes concerning, among other things, the political role of the
Calvinist church. Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus</em> can be seen as an intervention in this broad
dispute. The stated goals of this work were to dispel charges of
atheism, to oppose the prejudices of the theologians, and to defend
the freedom to philosophize (Epistle 30). Setting aside the first aim,
which was a spectacular failure (see
 <a href="#RecInfSpiPolPhi">&sect;6</a>),
 we will focus on Spinoza&rsquo;s critique of superstition and his
arguments for the freedom of philosophizing.</p>

<h3 id="CouSocRooSup">3.1 Countering the Social Roots of Superstition</h3>

<p>
The TTP opens with a trenchant analysis of fear&rsquo;s role in
engendering superstition (Preface.1&ndash;6). Put simply, Spinoza
thinks that fear makes one credulous and so prone to superstitious
thinking. The powerful exploit this condition, using the levers of
religion (e.g., fear of damnation, hope of salvation) to inspire
anxiety and breed dependence, shoring up their own power
(Preface.9&ndash;10). An empowered clergy are among those who
contribute to this unhappy condition by encouraging ambitious people,
rather than those motivated by loving-kindness (<em>caritas</em>), to
join their ranks, turning &ldquo;the temple&rdquo; into a
&ldquo;Theater&rdquo; (Preface.15), and channeling widespread anxiety
into a resentment towards religious dissidents. While there is much
more to say about Spinoza&rsquo;s account of the social roots of
superstition in the TTP (see James 2020: Ch. 3; Steinberg 2018a: Ch.
6), the crucial point here, which sets the agenda for much of the
work, is that Spinoza takes an empowered clergy to be the primary
source of a politically debilitating superstition.</p>

<h3 id="SepThe">3.2 The Separation Thesis</h3>

<p>
Chapters 1&ndash;15 of the TTP can be seen as constituting the first
plank of a two-plank argument against clerical power. These chapters,
though full of self-standing arguments, can be seen as working towards
a single primary claim: the separation of faith from philosophy. The
claim that faith and philosophy are distinct (hereafter: Separation
Thesis) is politically significant in a couple of ways. First, it is
based in a deflationary conception of faith as that set of beliefs,
whatever its contents, that conduce to piety, loving-kindness, and
obedience (TTP 14). By denying that faith requires true beliefs about
God&rsquo;s nature, and by treating the essential moral content of
Scripture as simple and directly accessible to all readers, Spinoza
effectively undercuts clerical claims to intellectual authority.
Second, by separating faith and philosophy, Spinoza allows that
philosophical inquiry, however bold, cannot be contrary to faith
unless it results in impious motivations or works. This is a crucial
step in the direction of defending the freedom to philosophize
 (<a href="#Tol">&sect;3.5</a>;
 L&aelig;rke 2021).</p>

<p>
One could divide the argument for the Separation Thesis into five
stages. The first stage (Preface) consists of reading Scripture
&ldquo;with an unprejudiced and free spirit&rdquo; (TTP Preface.20).
Rather assuming <em>ex ante</em> the truth of Scripture, Spinoza vows
&ldquo;to affirm nothing about it, and to admit nothing as its
teaching, which it did not very clearly teach me&rdquo; (ibid.). This
minimal, though not uncontroversial, methodological principle makes
possible stage two (Ch. 1&ndash;6), in which Spinoza directly
critiques the view that Scripture is the source of metaphysical
insight into God&rsquo;s nature and actions. In these chapters,
Spinoza denies the possibility of miracles and treats prophetic claims
to knowledge as mere products of lively imaginations. Still, it would
be a mistake to think that Scripture is simply a confused
philosophical text. To block this inference, Spinoza needs a robust
interpretative method, which he supplies in TTP 7 (stage three). In
this chapter, he advances a naturalistic exegetical method, according
to which to understand a text, we must inquire into &ldquo;life,
character and concerns of the author&rdquo; (TTP 7.23) and the
conditions of its composition. And we must start our analysis with
what is &ldquo;universal and common to the [text as a] whole&rdquo;
(TTP 7.27), that is, with those claims that are most pervasive and
immediately evident. He then applies this naturalistic approach to
Scripture, first in order to reject decisively the view of Scripture
as divine revelation (stage four: Ch. 8&ndash;12), and then, in the
fifth and final stage of the argument (Ch. 13&ndash;15), to show that
what is pervasive to Scripture&mdash;the &ldquo;common notions&rdquo;
of the text, as it were&mdash;is nothing other than a set of simple
moral truths encouraging obedience and the love of God and one&rsquo;s
neighbor. Unlike philosophy, which aims at metaphysical truth, faith
aims only to promote obedience and good works.</p>

<p>
By separating religion and philosophy, faith and reason, Spinoza
distances himself both from those who&mdash;like Maimonides and
Spinoza&rsquo;s friend Ludwig Meyer&mdash;twist Scripture to make it
conform to reason, and those who claim that where Scripture conflicts
with reason we must renounce reason (TTP 15.1&ndash;22). The
Separation Thesis has profound political import, since it undercuts
the grounds for many theological disputes that were the source of
considerable unrest in the Dutch Republic. And by showing that
Scripture is not the source of great mysteries that must be
interpreted by a clerical vanguard, but is rather a repository of
simple moral lessons that are immediately comprehensible to all,
Spinoza undercuts much of the basis for ecclesiastical authority.</p>

<h3 id="SinAutThe">3.3 The Single Authority Thesis</h3>

<p>
While the Separation Thesis undercuts clerical claims to
<em>epistemic</em> authority, the next block of block of chapters (TTP
16&ndash;19) undercuts clerical claims to <em>political</em> authority
(the second plank of the argument), by establishing that
&ldquo;authority in sacred matters belongs wholly to the sovereign
powers &rdquo; (Ch. 19, title). The claim that the civil sovereign
holds authority over (external) matters of religion&mdash;a view
referred to as Erastianism after theologian Thomas Erastus&mdash;turns
on an analysis of the conditions of sovereign authority. Spinoza
accepts, with Bodin and Hobbes, that sovereignty consists in the
absolute authority to legislate (Prokhovnik 2001). If it were not
within the sovereign right to determine what counts as divine law (TTP
19.1) or what counts as pious (with respect to external expressions of
religion) (TTP 19.3), then the &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; would not in
fact have absolute authority to legislate, the &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo;
would not be sovereign (TTP 19.41&ndash;42). Where authority is
divided, there is no sovereignty. This is a kind of analytical
argument from the concept of sovereignty as absolute legislator. In
order, then, for the sovereign to be a sovereign, and for the state to
be guided as if by a single mind, the civil sovereign must retain
authority over (external manifestations of) religion.</p>

<p>
Of course, a sovereign could delegate authority to religious
functionaries, while still maintaining ultimate authority; but Spinoza
cautions against this, using the case of the Hebrews to illustrate the
dangers of priestly authority. What precipitated the decline of the
first Hebrew state was the ascendance of a priestly order. On
Spinoza&rsquo;s account, under Moses, civil law and religion
&ldquo;were one and the same thing&rdquo; (TTP 17.31) and the Jews
lived peaceably. However, when the priests were given the right to
interpret divine law,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
each one began to seek the glory of his own name both in religion and
in other matters, determining everything by priestly authority and
daily issuing new decrees&hellip;The result? Religion declined into a
deadly superstition. (18.8&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The message here had palpable application in the Dutch context, where
Calvinist theocrats were increasingly wielding power to the detriment
of peace and stability
 (<a href="#ThePolBac">&sect;1.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
On Spinoza&rsquo;s account, the history of the Hebrew state reveals
that civil stability requires the limitation of ecclesiastical power,
and that it is disastrous for clerics to exercise coercive power over
matters of religion (TTP 18.22&ndash;27). This is another step in the
direction of defending the freedom to philosophize
 (<a href="#Tol">&sect;3.5</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="PosCivFunRel">3.4 Positive Civil Function of Religion</h3>

<p>
Despite its potential for harm, Spinoza thinks that religion can
perform a positive political function. It can help to promote
obedience and civic-mindedness (e.g., TTP 14; cf. discussion of Moses
and state religion in TTP 5). For instance, the ceremonial laws and
practices of the Jews helped to foster and preserve cohesion among an
ignorant, nomadic populace (TTP 3 and 5). The central moral message of
religion&mdash;namely, to love one&rsquo;s neighbor (e.g., TTP
14.9)&mdash;may be understood through reason; but Scripture presents
this same message in a manner that is suited to the understanding of
the masses (TTP 14.36; see Strauss 1930 [1965: Ch. 9]; Smith 1997: Ch.
2). Religion might also play a role in promoting compliance with the
law. Michael Rosenthal has suggested that, on Spinoza&rsquo;s account,
&ldquo;transcendental beliefs&rdquo; assist in overcoming free rider
problems; defections from agreements and non-compliance with the law
would likely be widespread among human beings were it not for religion
(Rosenthal 1998).</p>

<p>
The salutary function of religion is undermined when sectarianism
emerges. To diminish the threat of sectarianism, Spinoza advances a
universal or civil religion that captures the moral core of religion,
to which all citizens can subscribe, irrespective of what other
private beliefs they hold (TTP 14.22&ndash;34). Like Rousseau after
him, Spinoza seeks to promote a universal civic religion that can
bolster solidarity, channeling religious passions into social
benefits.</p>

<h3 id="Tol">3.5 Toleration</h3>

<p>
Spinoza is often regarded as a liberal, due, in large part, to his
defense of the freedoms of thought and speech in TTP 20. However, the
tolerationism expressed in TTP 20 might seem to stand in tension with
the Erastian claim of TTP 19. How can Spinoza be a liberal about
religious practice while also defending the view that the state
maintains full right over matters of religion? There are three things
worth noting here. First, unlike Locke&rsquo;s tolerationism,
Spinoza&rsquo;s defense of civil liberties in TTP 20 is not
fundamentally a defense freedom of worship (Israel 2001:
265&ndash;266). Rather, it is essentially a defense of the freedom to
philosophize (for a comprehensive account of what this consists in,
see L&aelig;rke 2021); religious freedom is at best a byproduct of
this primary aim. Second, Spinoza distinguishes between outward
expressions of faith and one&rsquo;s inward worship of God. Sovereign
authority extends only to the former, leaving the latter to the
individual, for reasons that we will examine in a moment. Both of
these positions can be understood as lending support to the Arminian
cause against Calvinist Theocrats. Finally, Spinoza&rsquo;s
Erastianism points to the limited character of his brand of
toleration. The sovereign retains full discretion to determine which
actions are acceptable and which forms of speech are seditious. As
Lewis Feuer ruefully notes, Spinoza does not offer anything resembling
Oliver Wendell Holmes&rsquo;s standard of &ldquo;clear and present
danger&rdquo; to constrain sovereign intervention (Feuer 1958 [1987:
114]).</p>

<p>
Spinoza advances several arguments in defense of the freedom to
philosophize. The first argument is that it is strictly impossible to
control another&rsquo;s beliefs completely (TTP 20.1&ndash;6). Since
right is coextensive with power, lacking the power to control beliefs
entails lacking the right to do so. However, because Spinoza admits
that beliefs can be influenced in myriad ways, this argument only
takes one so far in a defense of the freedom of thought.</p>

<p>
To expand the case, Spinoza turns from considering what the sovereign
<em>can</em> do to what it would be <em>practical</em> or
<em>prudent</em> for a sovereign to do (TTP 20.6), offering a battery
of prudential arguments in defense of non-interference. He argues that
because people are prone to express what they think, the strict
regulation of speech will be perceived as violent or oppressive (TTP
20.8&ndash;9), provoking instability and resentment. And even if a
state were able to prevent people from speaking their minds, this
would only result in the erosion of good faith [<em>fides</em>] on
which civil associations depend, since people would &ldquo;think one
thing and say something else&rdquo; (TTP 20.27).</p>

<p>
Spinoza also argues that in general the more oppressively a sovereign
governs, the more rebellious the citizens will be, since most people
become resentful when their views are regarded as criminal (TTP
20.28&ndash;29). Legislative persecution and civil resistance have a
common root on Spinoza&rsquo;s account, namely, ambition, or the
desire that others judge things as we do (<em>E</em>IIIP31S,
<em>E</em>VP4S) (see Rosenthal 2001 and 2003). People are so
constituted that when differences of opinion arise&mdash;as they
inevitably do&mdash;they are inclined to foist their views on others
and to resist others&rsquo; attempts to do the same. But however
natural the ambitious impulse to compel others&rsquo; beliefs and
expressions may be, if incorporated into law, the result is
catastrophic. Moreover, since it is often the ignorant and vicious who
initiate moral crusades, and the wise and peace-loving who are the
targets, we ought to be especially wary of political restrictions of
belief and speech (TTP 20.33&ndash;36).</p>

<p>
These arguments in defense of civil liberties are, by and large,
prudential. They are not principled arguments that depend on rights or
the intrinsic value of such liberty, much to the disappointment of
some commentators (Feuer 1958 [1987]; Curley 1996). The defense is
also notably restricted. While it is imprudent to seek to use state
power to control thought and speech, it is also
&ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; to grant unlimited freedom of speech (TTP
20.10). Specifically, the sovereign must stamp out seditious speech
(TTP 20.20&ndash;21), which includes not only the denial of sovereign
supreme authority (TTP 20.21; cf. TP 19.34), but also, apparently,
forms of speech marked by pronounced anger, hatred, or deception (TTP
20.14, TTP 20.12, TTP 20.21), which divide the commonwealth. Far from
being a free speech absolutist, Spinoza defends freedom of speech just
insofar as, and to the extent that, it promotes civic harmony and
flourishing (Steinberg 2010b). We should not, then, conflate the
freedom of philosophizing that Spinoza so staunchly defends, with the
liberty to say whatever one wishes (see L&aelig;rke 2021).</p>

<h3 id="SocConTTP">3.6 Social Contract in the TTP</h3>

<p>
Scholars have long puzzled about how to understand Spinoza&rsquo;s
account of the social contract in the TTP. Spinoza introduces the
contract in Chapter 16, claiming that in order to overcome pre-civil
strife, &ldquo;[people] had to make a very firm resolution and
contract to direct everything only according to the dictate of
reason&rdquo; (TTP 16.14), transferring one&rsquo;s right to determine
how to live and defend oneself to the sovereign (TTP 16.25&ndash;26);
cf. <em>E</em>IVP37S2). Later, Spinoza points to the establishment of
the Hebrew state, with Moses as the sovereign, as an historical
example of a social contract (TTP 19.12). The social contract seems to
confer nearly boundless authority on the sovereign. At least as long
as we are rational, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re bound to carry out absolutely
all commands of the supreme power&mdash;even if it commands the
greatest absurdities&rdquo; (TTP 16.27).</p>

<p>
It is hard to see how to square Spinoza&rsquo;s contractualism with
his naturalism. What is this right that is surrendered or transferred?
And how can one transfer away one&rsquo;s right, if one&rsquo;s right
is coextensive with one&rsquo;s power? Some commentators take these
problems with Spinoza&rsquo;s social contract to be insurmountable,
seeing his abandonment of contract-talk in the TP as an acknowledgment
of the inconsistency of the TTP (Wernham 1958). Others interpret the
contract in a way that is makes it consistent with his naturalism.
This requires distinguishing between two Latin concepts are rendered
in English as &ldquo;power&rdquo; (Negri 1981 [1991]; see also
Curley&rsquo;s Glossary [entry: &ldquo;Power&rdquo;] in Spinoza
[CWS]). On the one hand there is one&rsquo;s <em>potentia</em>, which
is the (non-transferrable) power that is essential to the individual
(Barbone &amp; Rice 2000). One the other hand, there is one&rsquo;s
<em>potestas</em>, one&rsquo;s authority (Barbone &amp; Rice 2000) or
coercive power (Blom 1995). Arguably, Spinoza operates with two
corresponding concepts of right, one of which is co-extensive with
one&rsquo;s causal power (<em>potentia</em>) and the other of which
corresponds to one&rsquo;s <em>potestas</em> (see Steinberg 2008). One
can cede one&rsquo;s right insofar as one puts oneself under the
other&rsquo;s <em>potestas</em>. And, on Spinoza&rsquo;s account, one
is under another&rsquo;s <em>potestas</em> insofar as one strongly
depends upon and defers to the other (TTP 17.5&ndash;8; TP
2.9&ndash;10). Spinoza seems to be arguing in these passages that
power is not transferred by way of a speech act, but through an
ongoing pattern of (psychological) deference.</p>

<p>
To be sure, there remain passages that are difficult to square with
the naturalistic reading of the contract, passages that imply that we
have obligations arising from the transfer of right, even when we are
not motivated to obey (TTP 16.27)&mdash;this suggests that the
legitimacy of the contract and the obligations to which it gives rise
do not depend on deference alone. However, defenders of the
naturalistic reading have sought to explain away these cases, for
instance by arguing that civil obligations are rooted in deference but
that there is a distinction between the kind of ongoing patterned
dependence in virtue of which one stands under the right of another
and incurs obligations and particular instances of compliance
(Steinberg 2018a: Ch. 2).</p>

<h2 id="TraPol">4. The <em>Tractatus Politicus</em></h2>

<p>
One might wonder why, having published the TTP in 1670, Spinoza
decided shortly thereafter to start working on a second political
treatise. It is tempting to suppose that he must have come to reject
many of his earlier views. However, with the possible exception of his
view of the social contract (see
 <a href="#MetBasSta">&sect;4.1</a>),
 there is little evidence that Spinoza came to reject any of the
central claims of his earlier treatise. Rather, the TP is
distinguished from the earlier treatise chiefly by its aims and
rhetorical style. Whereas the TTP was written for an audience of
liberal Christian theologians to address the problems posed by
officious Calvinist theocrats, the TP is concerned with the general
organization of the state and was written for philosophers. In the
later treatise, Spinoza abandons what has been described as the
&ldquo;theological idiom of popular persuasion&rdquo; (Feuer 1958
[1987: 151]) in favor of the dispassionate style of a political
scientist (Balibar 1985 [1998: 50]).</p>

<p>
The TP is a fitting sequel to the <em>Ethics</em> (Matheron 1969).
Whereas the <em>Ethics</em> reveals the path to individual freedom,
the TP reveals the extent to which individual freedom depends on civil
institutions (Matheron 1969). We should not be surprised to find
Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy taking a civic turn near the end of his
life. From his earliest writings, he claims that he is concerned not
just to perfect his own nature but also</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
to form a society of the kind that is desirable, so that as many as
possible may attain [a flourishing life] as easily and surely as
possible. (<em>Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect</em>,
&sect;14, in Spinoza [CW])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The TP may be seen as Spinoza&rsquo;s attempt to articulate some of
the conditions for the possibility of such a society.</p>

<p>
The work can be divided into three sections. In the first section
(roughly Chs. 1&ndash;4), Spinoza discusses the metaphysical basis of
the state and the natural limits of state power. In the second section
(Ch. 5), Spinoza lays out the general aims of the state. And in the
third section (Ch. 6 to Ch. 11), Spinoza advances and justifies
institutional recommendations for different regime forms: monarchy,
aristocracy, and democracy.</p>

<h3 id="MetBasSta">4.1 Metaphysical Basis of the State</h3>

<p>
In the early chapters of the TP, Spinoza puts forth his naturalistic
program, including the thesis that the state, like everything else, is
a natural thing (<em>res naturalis</em>), governed by the laws of
nature (TP 4.4) (see Bartuschat 1984). As for its origin, Spinoza
insists here, apparently in contrast to the contractual account of the
TTP (Wernham 1958; Matheron 1990), that one</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
must seek the causes and natural foundations of the state, not from
the teachings of reason, but from the common nature or condition of
men. (TP 1.7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Specifically, Spinoza claims that since humans are individually weak
and effectively powerless on our own (TP 2.15), they will be driven by
common affects to enter into a commonwealth (TP 3.9; TP 6.1) (see
Matheron 1969 and 1990). While scholars have sought to flesh out
Spinoza&rsquo;s analysis of the genesis of the state in the TP (Den
Uyl 1983, 1985; Matheron 1969, 1990), the account that Spinoza
advances is quite thin, leaving much room for conjecture.</p>

<h3 id="GenAimSta">4.2 General Aim of the State</h3>

<p>
Having argued in the preceding chapters that anything that can be done
is done by right, in TP 5 Spinoza distinguishes sharply between doing
something by right and doing something in the best way. The central
question going forward is not about the right of the state, but about
&ldquo;the best condition of each state&rdquo; (TP 5.1). And in order
to determine this, we must first identify the &ldquo;end&rdquo;
[<em>finis</em>] or fundamental aim of the state, which Spinoza claims
is &ldquo;peace and security of life&rdquo; [<em>pax vitaeque
securitas</em>] (TP 5.2). To fully appreciate what Spinoza means, we
must explicate Spinoza&rsquo;s conception of peace. He rejects
Hobbes&rsquo;s definition of peace as the &ldquo;absence of war&rdquo;
(<em>De Cive</em> 1.12), claiming instead that peace consists in the
&ldquo;union or harmony of minds&rdquo; (TP 6.4), which arises from
&ldquo;from strength of mind [<em>ex animi fortitudine</em>]&rdquo;
(TP 5.4), or rational affects (E3p59s). It is one thing, then, for a
state to persist or to avoid the ravages of war, it is quite another
for the state to flourish or exhibit peace (TP 5.5).</p>

<p>
But if the aim of the state is peace, and peace consists in the
&ldquo;harmony of minds&rdquo; arising from rational affects, one
might think that the state cannot accomplish its ends, since it is
unrealistic to expect most people to be rational (TP 1.5; TP 2.5; TP
2.18; TP 6.1). It is worth bearing in mind here that
&ldquo;agreement&rdquo; or &ldquo;harmony of minds&rdquo; comes in
degrees (see Blom 1993). Total agreement is possible only insofar as
people are fully rational (EIVP31&ndash;EIVP35). The state cannot
reasonably hope to promote total rationality and agreement; but it can
diminish fear and divisive forms of ignorance and foster psychological
security [<em>securitas</em>] and trust [<em>fides</em>], resulting in
a next-best level of agreement. (For tensions between idealist and
realist features of Spinoza&rsquo;s political thought, see Armstrong
2009). To see more precisely how Spinoza thinks that the state can
foster agreement, peace, and security (TP 5.2, TP 5.3), we must turn
to his institutional recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="ConModReg">4.3 Constitutionalism and Model Regimes</h3>

<p>
Spinoza seems to think that institutional structures and procedures
channel the natural passions of men towards the common good. The
vision here is one of mechanizing reason in much the same way the
Venetian Republic is said to have mechanized <em>virt&ugrave;</em>
(Pocock 1975: 284). Civil rationality is the product of republican
institutions that encourage broad participation, public deliberation,
and the adoption of a variety of accountability-promoting mechanisms.
A rationally organized state will not only promote the common good, in
so doing it will also strengthen the civic commitment of its citizens;
this is one way in which the state contributes to the reorientation of
the affects of its citizens and fosters agreement between citizens
(Steinberg 2009).</p>

<h4 id="Mon">4.3.1 Monarchy</h4>

<p>
In chapters 6 and 7, Spinoza sets out to show how a monarchy is to be
organized to promote peace. Crucially, he argues that the more
unchecked a monarch is, the worse off everyone is, including the
monarch (TP 6.8). This does not mean, however, that absolute
monarchies are unstable or can&rsquo;t endure. On the contrary
&ldquo;no state has stood so long without notable chance as that of
the [despotic] Turks&rdquo; (TP 6.4). But mere endurance is not the
same thing as peace, and when people are &ldquo;terrified from
fear&rdquo; the resulting condition is more aptly described as a
&ldquo;wasteland than a Commonwealth&rdquo; (TP 5.4).</p>

<p>
A well-structured monarchy will thus include constitutional checks on
the monarch. These foundational laws [<em>fundamenta</em>] are to be
understood as the king&rsquo;s &ldquo;eternal decrees&rdquo;
[<em>aeterna decreta</em>], expressing his real interests, which are
not to be contravened. Spinoza likens these &ldquo;decrees&rdquo; to
Ulysses&rsquo;s binding himself to the mast of his ship so as not to
yield to the Sirens&rsquo;s song (TP 7.1). One of the central
constitutional checks is that the King be responsive to a large
council of citizens (TP 6.15&ndash;30). In a properly constituted
state:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
whether the King is led by a fear of the multitude, perhaps to bind
the greater part of the armed multitude to himself, or led by a
nobility of spirit, to consult the public advantage, either
he&rsquo;ll always endorse the opinion which has the most votes, i.e.,
(by &sect;5), which is more useful to the majority, or he&rsquo;ll be
anxious to reconcile, if possible, the inconsistent opinions brought
to him, so that he draws everyone to himself. (TP 7.11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this way, a good monarchy will function like a homeostatic system,
ensuring that the interests of all members are held in check and that
the whole remains in a state of equilibrium (McShea 1968; cf. Field
2020). Ultimately, a model monarchy will be a constitutional monarchy
that will strongly resemble a democracy (Balibar 1985 [1998]), and
those states that deviate least from democracy will be most powerful
(Matheron 1997). Nevertheless, the fact that Spinoza countenanced the
possibility that &ldquo;a multitude can preserve a full enough freedom
under a King&rdquo; (TP 7.31), can be seen as a resignation to the
reality of Orangism after the events of 1672 (Blom 2007).</p>

<h4 id="Ari">4.3.2 Aristocracy</h4>

<p>
Spinoza discusses the best forms of two types of aristocracy. The
first is a centralized aristocracy, apparently modeled on the Venetian
Republic (Haitsma Mulier 1980). The second is a decentralized
aristocracy, in which sovereignty is held in common by several cities.
This type of aristocracy, which Spinoza takes to be superior (TP
9.15), is evidently modeled on the United Provinces. While
Spinoza&rsquo;s recommendations vary between these two types of
aristocracy, many of the general features remain the same. In
proto-Madisonian fashion, Spinoza argues that that the council of
patricians should be sizable so as to reduce the potential for
factionalism (e.g., TP 8.1; TP 8.38). A large council will protect
against selfish or irrational governance (TP 8.6; 9.14). The emphasis
once again is on mechanisms that keep private and public interest in
balance and encourage agreement (e.g., TP 8.19&ndash;8.24). One
important way in which agreement is encouraged is through the
promulgation of the &ldquo;universal faith&rdquo; or civil religion
(TP 8.46) (see
 <a href="#PosCivFunRel">&sect;3.4</a>)</p>
 
<p>
Given that there will be more formal checks on authority and a greater
diffusion of political power in aristocracies than in monarchies, we
should not find it surprising that Spinoza claims that aristocracies
are likely to be more absolute than monarchies (TP 8.7),
&ldquo;absolute&rdquo; here meaning not &ldquo;unchecked&rdquo; but
fully functioning as one (Steinberg 2018b).</p>

<p>
While Spinoza clearly indicates that aristocracies are generally
superior to monarchies, a more interesting and somewhat more vexed
question is how aristocracies compare with democracies. Raia
Prokhovnik, for example, has claimed that aristocracy is &ldquo;the
form of government [Spinoza] on mature reflection prefers&rdquo;
(2004: 210; cf. Feuer 1958 [1987] and Melamed 2013). Spinoza does
contend that the fact that patricians are elected in an Aristocracy,
as opposed to the birthright privileges of members of a Democracy,
would <em>seem</em> to make them superior. But he proceeds to argue
that this advantage is offset by the biased, self-serving behavior of
patricians (TP 11.2). And since he claims that democracy is the most
absolute form of regime (TP 11.1), absolutism in this context picking
out a clear merit (Steinberg 2018b), there is reason to doubt that he
regards Aristocracies as superior (Balibar 1985 [1998]). Ultimately,
though, Spinoza is less interested in rank ordering regimes than he is
in determining how each regime-type should be organized so as to
maximize peace and freedom.</p>

<h4 id="Dem">4.3.3 Democracy</h4>

<p>
Spinoza had just begun the first of what would likely have been two
chapters on democracy when he died on February 21, 1677. Democracy, as
he understands it, is a system of popular governance in which civil
status alone confers the right to participate. While Spinoza allows
that some democracies will be more inclusive than others (TP 11.2),
his own model democracy excludes not only foreigners, but also those
who are not <em>sui iuris</em>&mdash;e.g., women, children, and
servants (<em>servos</em>)&mdash;as well those who do not lead
&ldquo;respectable lives&rdquo; (<em>honesteque vivunt</em>) (TP
11/3). Contemporary readers rightly find these exclusionary aspects of
Spinoza&rsquo;s model democracy to be deplorable (Gatens 1996: Ch. 9),
especially his sexist attempt to justify the exclusion of women from a
democracy in part on the basis of their &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
inequality (TP 11.4), a thesis that seems somewhat in tension with
claims that he makes elsewhere (Sharp 2012)</p>

<p>
The merits of democratic government can be gleaned from his analyses
of monarchy and aristocracy, both of which include strong democratic
elements. Democracies have epistemic advantages over other forms of
government due to the size of the governing body, since larger
councils are more likely to be rational because participants in a
large collective body will aim only what is &ldquo;honorable&rdquo;
[<em>honestus</em>] or at least appears so (TP 8.6). The deliberative
aspect of large governing bodies also improves competency, since</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
human wits are too sluggish to penetrate everything right away, but by
asking advice, listening, and arguing, they&rsquo;re sharpened. (TP
9.14; cf. TTP 16.30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As for the worry that that there is &ldquo;neither truth nor
judgment&rdquo; in the common people (TP 7.27), Spinoza responds that
since &ldquo;everyone shares a common nature&rdquo;, differences in
competency are explained largely from the fact that &ldquo;rulers
manage the chief business of the state secretly&rdquo; (TP 7.27; cf.
TP 7.4). These claims belie Feuer&rsquo;s contention (1958 [1987])
that the murder of the de Witts resulted in an anti-democratic turn in
Spinoza&rsquo;s thought. While the explicit discussion of democracy in
the TP was largely preempted by the author&rsquo;s death, and the
remaining fragment contains little more than the lamentable attempt to
justify the exclusion of women and others from participation, the work
as a whole remains a significant and underappreciated contribution to
democratic theory (for a recent monograph on Spinoza and popular
power, see Field 2020).</p>

<h2 id="PlaStaSpiOnt">5. The Place of the State in Spinoza&rsquo;s Ontology</h2>

<p>
There is a lively discussion in the scholarly literature concerning
whether Spinoza&rsquo;s state is an individual with its own conatus
(this is sometimes framed as a debate between &ldquo;realist&rdquo;
and &ldquo;antirealists&rdquo; about the state&mdash;see LeBuffe
2021). The answer to this question is thought to carry implications
for how we conceive of Spinoza&rsquo;s relationship to liberalism.</p>

<p>
The most elaborate discussion of individuals and individuation in
Spinoza corpus is found in the &ldquo;physical digression&rdquo;
between EIIP13 and EIIP14, where he articulates an account of the
individuation of bodies. Here, Spinoza tells us that an individual is
a composite body whose parts &ldquo;communicate their motion to each
other in a certain fixed manner&rdquo; (G ii.100, A2, def, A3). The
parts of an individual may be replaced, but the individual will
persist, provided that the &ldquo;same ratio of motion and rest&rdquo;
is retained (ibid., L5, L4). Crucially, an individual&rsquo;s
&ldquo;nature&rdquo; (L4&ndash;L7) is retained if and only if (or
insofar and only insofar as) its ratio of motion and rest is
preserved. While this discussion focuses only on bodies, one can
reasonably infer that a parallel account of individuation would apply
<em>mutatis mutandis</em> to ideas, since &ldquo;the order and
connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of
things&rdquo; (EIIp7). A generalized version of this account would be
that an individual persists just insofar as its parts remain in the
same patterned relation (D. Garrett 1994).</p>

<p>
This account allows for the possibility of &ldquo;social
individuals&rdquo; or individuals composed at least in part of human
individuals. Spinoza makes this explicit when, of humans, he
writes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if two individuals of entirely the same nature are joined to one
another, they compose an individual twice as powerful as each one.
(EIVP18S)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the account scales up, so that we can think of individual nested
inside of other individuals, all the way up to the &ldquo;whole of
nature&rdquo; (i.e., of <em>natura naturata</em>), which is &ldquo;one
individual, whose parts, that is, all bodies, vary in infinite ways,
without any change of the whole individual&rdquo; (Physical Digression
L7 Schol). Still, the question remains: is the state such a
higher-order social individual?</p>

<p>
Alexandre Matheron&rsquo;s <em>Individu et Communaut&eacute; chez
Spinoza</em> contains the most influential realist interpretation of
Spinoza on the state (1969, esp. Ch. 3). Matheron identifies political
societies as individuals, characterized by their own &ldquo;formal
element&rdquo;, i.e., their own unique ratio of motion and rest (1969:
42, 58). Etienne Balibar too argues that the state a highly composite
individual, as an &ldquo;<em>individual of individuals</em>, having a
&lsquo;body&rsquo; and a &lsquo;soul&rsquo; or mind&rdquo; (1985
[1998: 64]). Others who have espoused this view include Meinecke (1924
[1957]), Blom (2007), Steinberg (2019), and LeBuffe (2021)</p>

<p>
Many are skeptical, though. Douglas Den Uyl points to the opening
passages of TTP 17, where Spinoza claims that individuals always
retain a &ldquo;considerable part&rdquo; of their own natural right,
as evidence that human beings are never fully integrated into the
super-individual, or state (Den Uyl 1983: 70). Still, the worry of
imperfect integration would seem to apply to all individuals: there is
always the potential for some parts to go rogue (EIIp24d) (see
Matheron 1969: 58). A second objection to state realism is that
whereas singular things can only be destroyed by external causes
(IIIP4), &ldquo;a Commonwealth is always put at greater risk on
account of its citizens than on account of its enemies&rdquo; (TP
6.6). And in fact if all individuals are singular things (for a
defense of this view, see D. Garrett 1994), then the fact that states
can ostensibly be destroyed by their parts (i.e., citizens) should
lead us to deny state realism (Barbone &amp; Rice 2000: 26&ndash;7).
This is a forceful objection. However, there is no reason to think
that an account of the apparent self-destruction of the commonwealth
could not be offered that parallels Spinoza&rsquo;s attempt to explain
how suicide is possible in light of the conatus doctrine (EIVP20S). An
apparently self-destructive state could be one that is so affected by
&ldquo;hidden external causes&rdquo;, so overwhelmed by destructive
passions, that it takes on a new nature that is contrary to its
original nature (EIVP20S.). Apparent civil self-destruction might
simply be the result of poorly-integrated individuals functioning as
external causes.</p>

<p>
A third challenge to state realism is that if the state is an
individual, it should have a mind of its own. But Steven Barbone
points out that references to the mind of the state are typically
preceded by qualifying phrases like <em>veluti</em> (&ldquo;as it
were&rdquo;) and <em>quasi</em> (&ldquo;as if&rdquo;), indicating that
the state has a mind only metaphorically (Barbone 2002:104&ndash;105).
This objection might be mitigated by arguing that individuality is
itself a matter of degree and that states are at best
&ldquo;loose&rdquo; individuals (Della Rocca 1996: Ch. 2), with
limited cohesion or regularity of action. This is consistent with the
preceding claim that integration into a larger union is itself a
matter of degree.</p>

<p>
What seems to be driving many of these antirealist objections is the
worry that if the state is an individual, its interests might trump
the interests of its constituents, particular human beings (see Rice
1990; Barbone 2002). Isaiah Berlin (1958 [1969]) condemned Spinoza
precisely because he took Spinoza to be reifying the state and putting
state interests above individual interests, echoing Popper&rsquo;s
critique of Hegel. But even if the state is an individual, it does not
follow that its interests would supersede the interests of its
citizens. Certainly, from the perspective of a citizen, there is no
reason why one would have to put the interests of the state above
one&rsquo;s own interests if these two were genuinely to come into to
conflict. Consequently, some of the worries of the antirealists might
be misplaced. Indeed, Michael LeBuffe has recently defended a version
of state realism, according to which it is precisely because the state
is a complex individual whose power can come apart from the power of
its constituents that we must guard against empowering it to our own
detriment (LeBuffe 2021).</p>

<h2 id="RecInfSpiPolPhi">6. The Reception and Influence of Spinoza&rsquo;s Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
The extent of influence of Spinoza&rsquo;s political thought is
difficult to assess. Even when Spinoza&rsquo;s influence on subsequent
political thought is direct and indisputable, it is not always easy to
tease out how much of this is due to his own political philosophy and
how much is due to his metaphysics more generally. Further
complicating the assessment is the fact that Spinoza and Spinozism
remained a bugbear throughout Europe for much of the late seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. For this reason, even sympathetic
philosophers often sought to distance their views from
Spinoza&rsquo;s, positioning themselves as critics or downplaying
familiarity with his texts. Nevertheless, we find traces of the
influence of Spinoza&rsquo;s political writings throughout the
Enlightenment, along with an array of hostile responses.</p>

<p>
The publication of the unfinished TP in Spinoza&rsquo;s posthumous
<em>Opera</em> was met with relative indifference, upstaged as it was
by the simultaneous appearance of <em>Ethics</em> (L&aelig;rke 2010).
However, the TTP was read, discussed, and condemned in the decades
following its publication in 1670. The critical reception tended to
focus on the perceived irreligious features of the work&mdash;for
instance, the refutation of miracles and the denial of the divine
origin of the Pentateuch&mdash;but the naturalistic account of right
and law and the arguments for the freedom to philosophize also
provoked debate.</p>

<p>
Jakob Thomasius, Leibniz&rsquo;s teacher in Leipzig, composed a work,
<em>Adversus Anonymum, de Libertate Philosophandi</em>, devoted
entirely to refuting the TTP and its underlying naturalism. Leibniz
too seems to have regarded Spinoza&rsquo;s views on right and law as
more dangerous even than Hobbes&rsquo;s, for while Hobbes at least
allowed conceptual space for a divine legislator, Spinoza did not
(L&aelig;rke 2010). Even relatively liberal natural lawyers like
Lambert van Velthuysen (1622&ndash;1685) and Samuel Pufendorf
(1632&ndash;1694), regarded Spinoza&rsquo;s treatment of right, law,
and obligation as fundamentally dangerous. Velthuysen protests that,
in the absence of a divine legislator, there is &ldquo;no room left
for precepts and commandments&rdquo; (Ep. 42) in Spinoza&rsquo;s
philosophy. And Pufendorf maintains that Spinoza&rsquo;s conception of
right is defective in that it fails to produce a &ldquo;moral
effect&rdquo; or to put others under obligations (Pufendorf 1672
[1934: 391]; see Curley 1995).</p>

<p>
While Spinoza&rsquo;s views on right and law were generally met with
contempt, his views on the freedom to philosophize [<em>libertas
philosophandi</em>] prompted a more mixed reaction. The doctrine had
its critics (see Israel 2010: 81&ndash;2), but it also had its
admirers, perhaps including some of the most prominent early-modern
tolerationists. Bayle, Locke, and Toland, for instance, were familiar
with Spinoza&rsquo;s defense and likely found some inspiration in it,
even while they denied deep acquaintance (Locke) or situated
themselves as critics (Bayle and Toland). Toland&rsquo;s use in
<em>Pantheisticon</em> of the same epigram from the opening of
Tacitus&rsquo;s <em>Histories</em>&mdash;&ldquo;rare are the happy
times when we may think what we wish and say what we think [<em>rara
temporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis et quae sentias dicere
licet</em>]&rdquo;&mdash;that Spinoza alludes to in the title of TTP
20 indicates an affinity between the two thinkers on matters of
freedom of speech and thought (for more on the use of this epigram in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, see Paul Russell 2008: Ch.
7),</p>

<p>
Later enlightenment thinkers embraced Spinoza&rsquo;s thesis that
whereas the freedoms of thought and expression should be protected,
one ought to obey the sovereign&rsquo;s decisions on matters of action
(for worries about whether Spinoza&rsquo;s metaphysics can permit this
division, see Della Rocca 2008, 223&ndash;4). Echoes of this view can
be found in Moses Mendelssohn&rsquo;s separation of action and
conviction in <em>Jerusalem</em> (Mendelssohn 1783 [1983: 40];
Gottlieb 2011: 50; Goetschel 2004: 168). This distinction was even
adopted by Frederick the Great, whose policy that people may argue
about whatever they wish, provided that they obey is famously
celebrated in Kant&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;What is Enlightenment?&rdquo;
[<em lang="de">Was ist Aufkl&auml;rung?</em>].</p>

<p>
It is also worth mentioning Spinoza&rsquo;s influence on the
democratic thought of the French Enlightenment. Jonathan Israel has
examined the myriad ways in which Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy shaped
egalitarian political thought, including, perhaps most significantly,
the political thought of the encyclop&eacute;distes (Israel 2011,
2023). Spinoza&rsquo;s influence here is primarily due to his
naturalism, which inspired the materialist metaphysics that
underpinned French democratic thought, rather than to his political
arguments. And Spinoza&rsquo;s realist and arguably anti-revolutionary
political method suggests that even if Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy
influenced revolutionary democratic thought, it likely had little to
do with his actual political philosophy. (For divergent assessments of
Spinoza&rsquo;s attitude towards revolution, see Rosenthal 2013 and
Sharp 2013). Nevertheless, one finds more than a whiff of
Spinoza&rsquo;s absolutist conception of democracy in the accounts of
the general will [<em lang="fr">volont&eacute;
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</em>] found in Rousseau (see Eckstein 1944;
Williams 2010) and Diderot (Israel 2011).</p>

<p>
Spinoza&rsquo;s thought was also briefly, but enthusiastically, taken
up by Russian Marxists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Most notably, Georgi Plekhanov (1856&ndash;1918), one of
the primary expositors of the philosophical basis of Marxism, claimed
that Marxism was but a &ldquo;variety of Spinozism&rdquo; (cited in
Kline 1952: 15) and reported that Engels told him in conversation that
&ldquo;old Spinoza was quite right&rdquo; on matters of ontology
(&ldquo;Bernstein and Materialism&rdquo;, in Plekhanov 1898 [1976:
339]). Lyubov Isaakovna Akselrod (1868&ndash;1946) and Abram Deborin
(1881&ndash;1963) followed Plekhanov in defending Spinozism as the
proper metaphysical foundation of Marxism (Steila 2022; Matysik 2022).
But while these figures were all committed political thinkers,
Spinoza&rsquo;s influence on them, as with his influence on the French
encyclop&eacute;distes, was due primarily to his
metaphysics&mdash;specifically, his putative &ldquo;materialism&rdquo;
(see Steinberg forthcoming).</p>

<p>
More recently, Spinoza&rsquo;s political philosophy has figured
prominently in post-1968 leftist French political thought (for a
survey, see van Bunge 2012). However, in Anglophone countries, few
contemporary political philosophers seriously engage with
Spinoza&rsquo;s work, even while scholarly interest has grown. There
is reason to hope, however, that as Spinoza continues to emerge from
Hobbes&rsquo;s shadow, Anglophone political philosophers may begin to
appreciate the richness, originality, and systematicity of
Spinoza&rsquo;s political philosophy, and the ways in which it might
illuminate theories of democracy, toleration, authority, social
ontology, the relationship between civil institutions and social
affects, and much more.</p>
