<h1>The Moral Status of Animals</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jul 1, 2003; substantive revision Mon Aug 12, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Is there something distinctive about humanity that justifies the idea
that humans have moral status while non-humans do not? Providing an
answer to this question has become increasingly important among
philosophers as well as those outside of philosophy who are interested
in our treatment of non-human animals. For some, answering this
question will enable us to better understand the nature of human
beings and the proper scope of our moral obligations. Some argue that
there is an answer that can distinguish humans from the rest of the
natural world. Many of those who accept this answer are interested in
justifying certain human practices towards non-humans&mdash;practices
that cause pain, discomfort, suffering, and death. This latter group
expects that in answering the question in a particular way, humans
will be justified in granting moral consideration to other humans that
is neither required nor justified when considering non-human animals.
In contrast to this view, an increasing number of philosophers have
argued that while humans are different in a variety of ways from each
other and other animals, these differences do not provide a
philosophical defense for denying non-human animals moral
consideration. What the basis of moral consideration is and what it
amounts to has been the source of much disagreement.</p>

<h2 id="MoraConsAnim">1. The Moral Considerability of Animals</h2>

<p>
To say that a being deserves moral consideration is to say that there
is a moral claim that this being can make on those who can recognize
such claims. A morally considerable being is a being who can be
wronged. It is often thought that because only humans can recognize
moral claims, it is only humans who are morally considerable. However,
when we ask why we think human animals are the only types of beings
that can be morally wronged, we begin to see that the class of beings
able to recognize moral claims and the class of beings who can suffer
moral wrongs are not co-extensive. A variety of types of morally
relevant factors have been invoked to to justify who is morally
considerable.</p>

<h3 id="Spec">1.1 Speciesism</h3>

<p>
The view that only humans should be morally considered is sometimes
referred to as &ldquo;speciesism&rdquo;. In the 1970s, Richard Ryder
coined this term while campaigning in Oxford to denote a ubiquitous
type of human centered prejudice, which he thought was similar to
racism. He objected to favoring one&rsquo;s own species, while
exploiting or harming members of other species. Peter Singer
popularized the term and focused on the way speciesism, without moral
justification, favors the interests of humans:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight
to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash
between their interests and the interests of those of another race.
Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to
override the greater interests of members of other species. The
pattern is the same in each case. (Singer 1974: 108)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Discrimination based on race, like discrimination based on species is
thought to be prejudicial, because these are not factors that matter
when it comes to making moral claims.</p>

<p>
Speciesist actions and attitudes are prejudicial because there is no
prima facie reason for preferring the interests of beings belonging to
the species group to which one also belongs over the interests of
those who don&rsquo;t. That humans are considered to be members of the
species Homo sapiens &mdash; humans share a genetic make-up and a
distinctive physiology, we all emerge from a human pregnancy
&mdash; is unimportant from the moral point of view. Species
membership is morally irrelevant, a bit of luck that is no more
morally interesting than being born in Malaysia or Canada. It thus
cannot serve as the basis for a view that holds that our species
deserves moral consideration that is not owed to members of other
species.</p>

<p>
As Oscar Horta (2022) and others have noted, speciesism is not only an
individual attitude that some humans hold, but is a &ldquo;collective
phenomenon&rdquo; that springs from ideological commitments that are
generated within and shape institutions and social structures.
 Since membership in a species category is largely socially
determined, analyzing the meanings of category membership can help
illuminate further problems with speciesism. The social meanings of
categories structure not only the institutions we operate within but
also how we conceptualize ourselves and our world. Humans have
developed moral systems as well as a wide range of other valuable
practices, and by creating these systems, we separate the human from
the rest of the animal kingdom. But the category &ldquo;human&rdquo;
itself is morally contested. Some argue, for example, that racism is
not simply, or even primarily about discrimination and prejudice, but
rather a mechanism of dehumanizing blackness so as to provide the
conditions that make humans white (see Fanon 1967; Jackson 2020; Kim
2015; Ko &amp; Ko 2017). According to this line of thought, speciesism
isn&rsquo;t focused on discrimination or prejudice but is a central
tool for creating human (and white) supremacy or exceptionalism.</p>

<h3 id="HumaExce">1.2 Human Exceptionalism</h3>

<p>
Like speciesism, human exceptionalism can be understood in different
ways. The most common way of understanding it is to suggest that there
are distinctly human capacities and it is on the basis of these
capacities that humans have moral status and other animals do not. But
which capacities mark out all and only humans as the kinds of beings
that can be wronged? A number of candidate capacities have been
proposed&mdash;developing family ties, solving social problems,
expressing emotions, starting wars, having sex for pleasure, using
language, or thinking abstractly, are just a few. As it turns out,
none of these activities is uncontroversially unique to humans. Both
scholarly and popular work on animal behavior suggests that many of
the activities that are thought to be distinct to humans occur in
non-humans. For example, many species of non-humans develop long
lasting kinship ties&mdash;orangutan mothers stay with their young for
eight to ten years and while they eventually part company, they
continue to maintain their relationships. Less solitary animals, such
as chimpanzees, baboons, wolves, and elephants maintain extended
family units built upon complex individual relationships, for long
periods of time. Meerkats in the Kalahari desert are known to
sacrifice their own safety by staying with sick or injured family
members. All animals living in socially complex groups must solve
various problems that inevitably arise in such groups. Canids and
primates are particularly adept at it, yet even chickens and horses
are known to recognize large numbers of individuals in their social
hierarchies and to maneuver within them. One of the ways that
non-human animals negotiate their social environments is by being
particularly attentive to the emotional states of others around them.
When a conspecific is angry, it is a good idea to get out of his way.
Animals that develop life-long bonds are known to suffer from the
death of their partners. Some are even said to die of sorrow. As
Darwin noted in The Descent of Man: &ldquo;So intense is the grief of
female monkeys for the loss of their young, that it invariably caused
the death of certain kinds&rdquo; (1871: 40). Jane Goodall&rsquo;s
report of the death of the healthy 8 year old chimpanzee Flint just
three weeks after the death of his mother Flo also suggests that
sorrow can have a devastating effect on non-human animals (see Goodall
2000: 140&ndash;141 in Bekoff 2000). Coyotes, elephants and killer
whales are also among the species for which profound effects of grief
have been reported (Bekoff 2000) and many dog owners can provide
similar accounts. While the lives of many, perhaps most, non-humans in
the wild are consumed with struggle for survival, aggression and
battle, there are some non-humans whose lives are characterized by
expressions of joy, playfulness, and a great deal of sex (Woods 2010).
Studies in cognitive ethology have suggested that some non-humans
engage in manipulative and deceptive activity, can construct
&ldquo;cognitive maps&rdquo; for navigation, and some non-humans
appear to understand symbolic representation and are able to use
 language.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It appears that most of the capacities that are thought to distinguish
humans as morally considerable beings, have been observed, often in
less elaborate form, in the non-human world. Because human behavior
and cognition share deep roots with the behavior and cognition of
other animals, approaches that try to find sharp behavioral or
cognitive boundaries between humans and other animals remain
controversial. For this reason, attempts to establish human uniqueness
by identifying certain capacities are not the most promising when it
comes to thinking hard about the moral status of animals.</p>

<h3 id="Pers">1.3 Personhood</h3>

<p>
Nonetheless, there is something important that is thought to
distinguish humans from non-humans that is not reducible to the
observation of behavior best explained by possessing a certain
capacity, and that is our &ldquo;personhood&rdquo;. The notion of
personhood identifies a category of morally considerable beings that
is thought to be coextensive with humanity. Historically, Kant is the
most noted defender of personhood as the quality that makes a being
valuable and thus morally considerable (for a contemporary utilitarian
discussion of personhood, see Varner 2012). Kant writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;every rational being, exists as an end in himself and not
merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that
will&hellip;Beings whose existence depends not on our will but on
nature have, nevertheless, if they are not rational beings, only a
relative value as means and are therefore called things. On the other
hand, rational beings are called persons inasmuch as their nature
already marks them out as ends in themselves. (Kant [1785] 1998: [Ak
4: 428])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fact that the human being can have the representation
&ldquo;I&rdquo; raises him infinitely above all the other beings on
earth. By this he is a person&hellip;.that is, a being altogether
different in rank and dignity from things, such as irrational animals,
with which one may deal and dispose at one&rsquo;s discretion. (Kant
[1798] 2010: 239 [Ak 7: 127])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More recent work in a Kantian vein develops this idea. Christine
Korsgaard, for example, argues that humans &ldquo;uniquely&rdquo; face
a problem, the problem of normativity. This problem emerges because of
the reflective structure of human consciousness. We can, and often do,
think about our desires and ask ourselves &ldquo;Are these desires
reasons for action? Do these impulses represent the kind of things I
want to act according to?&rdquo; Our reflective capacities allow us
and require us to step back from our mere impulses in order to
determine when and whether to act on them. In stepping back we gain a
certain distance from which we can answer these questions and solve
the problem of normativity. We decide whether to treat our desires as
reasons for action based on our conceptions of ourselves, on our
&ldquo;practical identities&rdquo;. When we determine whether we
should take a particular desire as a reason to act we are engaging in
a further level of reflection, a level that requires an endorsable
description of ourselves. This endorsable description of ourselves,
this practical identity, is a necessary moral identity because without
it we cannot view our lives as worth living or our actions as worth
doing. Korsgaard suggests that humans face the problem of normativity
in a way that non-humans apparently do not:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A lower animal&rsquo;s attention is fixed on the world. Its
perceptions are its beliefs and its desires are its will. It is
engaged in conscious activities, but it is not conscious <em>of</em>
them. That is, they are not the objects of its attention. But we human
animals turn our attention on to our perceptions and desires
themselves, on to our own mental activities, and we are conscious
<em>of</em> them. That is why we can think <em>about</em>
them&hellip;And this sets us a problem that no other animal has. It is
the problem of the normative&hellip;. The reflective mind cannot
settle for perception and desire, not just as such. It needs a reason.
(Korsgaard 1996: 93)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Korsgaard understands &ldquo;reason&rdquo; as &ldquo;a kind of
reflective success&rdquo; and given that non-humans are thought to be
unable to reflect in a way that would allow them this sort of success,
it appears that they do not act on reasons, at least reasons of this
kind. Since non-humans do not act on reasons they do not have a
practical identity from which they reflect and for which they act. So
humans can be distinguished from non-humans because humans, we might
say, are sources of normativity and non-humans are not.</p>

<h4 id="RatiPers">1.3.1 Rational Persons</h4>

<p>
But arguably, Kant&rsquo;s view of personhood does not distinguish all
and only humans as morally considerable. Personhood is not, in fact,
coextensive with humanity when understood as a general description of
the group to which human beings belong. And the serious part of this
problem is not that there may be some extra-terrestrials or deities
who have rational capacities. The serious problem is that many humans
are not persons. Some humans&mdash;i.e., infants, children, people in
comas&mdash;do not have the rational, self-reflective capacities
associated with personhood. This problem, unfortunately known in the
literature as the problem of &ldquo;marginal cases&rdquo;, poses
serious difficulties for &ldquo;personhood&rdquo; as the criterion of
moral considerability. Many beings whose positive moral value we have
deeply held intuitions about, and who we treat as morally
considerable, will be excluded from consideration by this account.</p>

<p>
There are three ways to respond to this counter-intuitive conclusion.
One, which can be derived from one interpretation of Kant, is to
suggest that non-persons are morally considerable indirectly. Though
Kant believed that animals were mere things it appears he did not
genuinely believe we could dispose of them any way we wanted. In the
Lectures on Ethics he makes it clear that we have indirect duties to
animals, duties that are not toward them, but in regard to them
insofar as our treatment of them can affect our duties to persons.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of
service, he does not fail in his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot
judge, but his act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity
which it is his duty to show towards mankind. If he is not to stifle
his human feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he
who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men.
([1784&ndash;5] 1997: 212 [Ak 27: 459])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And one could argue the same would be true of those human beings who
are not persons. We disrespect our humanity when we act in inhumane
ways towards non-persons, whatever their species.</p>

<p>
This indirect view is unsatisfying&mdash;it fails to capture the
independent wrong that is being done to the non-person. When someone
rapes a woman in a coma, or whips a severely brain damaged child, or
sets a cat on fire, they are not simply disrespecting humanity or
themselves as representatives of it, they are wronging these
non-persons. So, a second way to avoid the counter-intuitive
conclusion is to argue that such non-persons stand in the proper
relations to &ldquo;rational nature&rdquo; such that they should be
thought of as morally considerable. Allen Wood (1998) argues in this
way and suggests that all beings that potentially have a rational
nature, or who virtually have it, or who have had it, or who have part
of it, or who have the necessary conditions of it, what he calls
&ldquo;the infrastructure of rational nature&rdquo;, should be
directly morally considerable. Insofar as a being stands in this
relation to rational nature, they are the kinds of beings that can be
wronged.</p>

<p>
This response is not unlike that of noted animal rights proponent, Tom
Regan, who argues that what is important for moral consideration are
not the differences between humans and non-humans but the
similarities. Regan argues that because persons share with certain
non-persons (which includes those humans and non-humans who have a
certain level of organized cognitive function) the ability to be
experiencing subjects of a life and to have an individual welfare that
matters to them regardless of what others might think, both deserve
moral consideration. Regan argues that subjects of a life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
want and prefer things, believe and feel things, recall and expect
things. And all these dimensions of our life, including our pleasure
and pain, our enjoyment and suffering, our satisfaction and
frustration, our continued existence or our untimely death&mdash;all
make a difference to the quality of our life as lived, as experienced,
by us as individuals. As the same is true of &hellip; animals &hellip;
they too must be viewed as the experiencing subjects of a life, with
inherent value of their own. (Regan 1985: 24)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A third way of addressing this problem has been taken up by Korsgaard,
who maintains that there is a big difference between those with
normative, rational capacities and those without, but unlike Kant,
believes both humans and non-humans are the proper objects of our
moral concern. She argues that those without normative, rational
capacities share certain &ldquo;natural&rdquo; capacities with
persons, and these natural capacities are often the content of the
moral demands that persons make on each other. She writes:</p>

<h4 id="LegaPers">1.3.2 Legal Persons</h4>

<p>
In the courts, all humans and some corporations are considered persons
in the legal sense. But all animals, infants and adults, are not legal
persons, but rather, under the law they are considered property. There
have been a few attempts to change the legal status of some nonhuman
animals from property to persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP)
founded by the late Steven Wise, has filed a series of cases in the
New York courts seeking to establish legal personhood for particular
chimpanzees being held in the state, with the goal of protecting their
rights to bodily integrity and liberty, and allow them to seek remedy,
through their proxies, when those rights are violated. Chimpanzees are
a good test case for establishing nonhuman legal personhood as they
are, according to the documents filed by NhRP, autonomous beings with
sophisticated cognitive abilities including:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
episodic memory, self-consciousness, self-knowing, self agency,
referential and intentional communication, mental time-travel,
numerosity, sequential learning, meditational learning, mental state
modeling, visual perspective taking, understanding the experiences of
others, intentional action, planning, imagination, empathy,
metacognition, working memory, decision-making, imitation, deferred
imitation, emulation, innovation, material, social, and symbolic
culture, cross-modal perception, tool-use, tool-making,
cause-and-effect. (petition of NhRP v. Samuel Stanley, p. 12, see
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>)</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
The legal arguments to extend personhood beyond the human parallel
more general ethical arguments that extend ethical consideration
outward from those who occupy the moral center. Turning to empirical
work designed to show that other animals are really similar to those
considered legal persons, primatologists submitted affidavits
attesting to what they have learned working with chimpanzees. Mary Lee
Jensvold suggests:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there are numerous parallels in the way chimpanzee and human
communication skills develop over time, suggesting a similar unfolding
cognitive process across the two species and an underlying
neurobiological continuity. (Jensvold affidavit, p. 4, in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>)</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
James King notes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
chimpanzees and humans resemble each other in terms of their ability
to experience happiness and the way in which it relates to individual
personality. (King affidavit, p. 8, in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>)</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
And Mathias Osvath makes remarkable claims about chimpanzee
personhood:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Autonoetic consciousness gives an individual of any species an
autobiographical sense of it self with a future and a past. Chimps and
other great apes clearly possess an autobiographical self, as they are
able to prepare themselves for future actions&hellip; they likely can,
just as humans, be in pain over an anticipated future event that has
yet to occur. For instance, confining someone in a prison or cage for
a set time, or for life, would lose much of its power as punishment if
that individual had no self-concept. Every moment would be a new
moment with no conscious relation to the next. But, chimpanzees. and
other great apes have a concept of their personal past and future and
therefore suffer the pain of not being able to fulfill one&rsquo;s
goals or move around as one wants; like humans they experience the
pain of anticipating a never-ending situation. (Osvath affidavit, pp.
4&ndash;7, in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>)</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
These claims, as well as those of others experts, identify the
relevantly similar capacities that chimpanzees and other great apes
share with humans and it is in virtue of these capacities that legal
personhood is sought.</p>

<h3 id="Sent">1.4 Sentience</h3>

<p>
Using rational nature or cognitive capacities as the touchstone of
moral considerability misses an important fact about animals, human
and nonhuman. Our lives can go better or worse for us. Utilitarians
have traditionally argued that the truly morally important feature of
beings is unappreciated when we focus on personhood or the rational,
self-reflective nature of humans, or the relation a being stands in to
such nature, or being the subject of a life, or being legal persons.
What is really important, utilitarians maintain, is the promotion of
happiness, or pleasure, or the satisfaction of interests, and the
avoidance of pain, or suffering, or frustration of interests. Bentham,
one of the more forceful defenders of this sentientist view of moral
considerability, famously wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Other animals, which, on account of their interests having been
neglected by the insensibility of the ancient jurists, stand degraded
into the class of <em>things</em>. [original emphasis] &hellip; The
day has been, I grieve it to say in many places it is not yet past, in
which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of
slaves, have been treated &hellip; upon the same footing as &hellip;
animals are still. The day may come, when the rest of the animal
creation may acquire those rights which never could have been
withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have
already discovered that the blackness of skin is no reason why a human
being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a
tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of
legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the
<em>ossacrum</em>, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a
sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace
the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps, the
faculty for discourse?&hellip;the question is not, Can they
<em>reason</em>? nor, Can they <em>talk</em>? but, Can they
<em>suffer</em>? (Bentham 1780/1789: chapter xvii, paragraph 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Contemporary utilitarians, such as Peter Singer (1990, [1979] 1993),
suggest that there is no morally justifiable way to exclude from moral
consideration non-humans or non-persons who can clearly suffer. Any
being that has an interest in not suffering deserves to have that
interest taken into account. And a non-human who acts to avoid pain
can be thought to have just such an interest. Even contemporary
Kantians have acknowledged the moral force of the experience of pain.
Korsgaard, for example, writes &ldquo;it is a pain to be in pain. And
that is not a trivial fact&rdquo; (1996: 154).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When you pity a suffering animal, it is because you are perceiving a
reason. An animal&rsquo;s cries express pain, and they mean that there
is a reason, a reason to change its conditions. And you can no more
hear the cries of an animal as mere noise than you can the words of a
person. Another animal can obligate you in exactly the same way
another person can. &hellip;So of course we have obligations to
animals. (Korsgaard 1996: 153)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When we encounter an animal in pain we recognize their claim on us,
and thus beings who can suffer are morally considerable.</p>

<p>
Though much work on sentience has been centered on mammals and birds,
in recent years there has been a surge of literature defending a need
to expand the circle of moral consideration to include other taxa,
following evidence that sentience extends beyond those initial groups
of animals. There are now sentience-based defenses of the moral status
of fishes (Bovenkerk &amp; Meijboom 2011; Balcombe 2017), octopuses
(Mather 2020; King &amp; Marino 2019; Jacquet et al. 2019), arthropods
(Mikhalevich &amp; Powell 2020), and decapod crustaceans (Crump et al.
2022). Nevertheless, sentience remains a non-observable capacity, and
consequently despite the scientific advances there is a lot of
uncertainty regarding the sentience of animals that are very
phylogenetically distant from us, such as insects. As a result,
several authors have defended the need to incorporate precautionary
principles to guide our interactions with these animals, considering
that we should err on the side of caution when dealing with beings
whose sentience is uncertain (e.g. Fischer 2016; Birch 2017; Knutsson
&amp; Munthe 2017).</p>

<h3>1.5 Agency</h3>

<p>
Some authors have sought to ground moral status in a being&rsquo;s
agency. Sebo (2017), for instance, distinguishes between propositional
agency and perceptual agency. Propositional agency is the capacity to
act on the basis of normative propositional judgments, and exemplifies
the kind of agency that philosophers tend to think of when they argue
that only humans can act, while animals can only behave. Perceptual
agency, in contrast, is the capacity to act on the basis of what Sebo
calls &lsquo;normative perceptual experiences&rsquo;, which happen
when we experience entities in the world as calling for a certain
treatment. Sebo considers that perceptual agency is widespread among
animals, and indeed is often exercised by humans. He argues that
insofar as we exercise the same kind of agency, we have the same kind
of moral status, and that all beings who have perceptual agency have a
right to life, liberty, and property. Jamieson (2018) also argues
against the pervasive view that human agency is radically distinct
from animal agency, and considers that acknowledging animal agency not
only brings greater humility in our dealings with other species, but
in addition allows us to appreciate that &ldquo;[f]or many of them, as
for us, the meaning and value of life turns on what affects agency as
well as on what affects welfare&rdquo; (p. 122). Wilcox (2020a) argues
that agency is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for moral
status. His reason for holding this view is that he considers agency
and sentience to be co-extensive, so that all agents are sentient and
vice versa. However, he believes it important to ground moral status
in agency, rather than sentience, to emphasize that moral status
entails not just a right to be protected from unnecessary suffering,
but also a right to self-determination. Similarly, Lessard (2024)
argues that grounding moral status in agency can offer a better
alternative than sentience for the legal protection of animals,
insofar as focusing solely on the reduction of suffering can still
allow for the exploitation and killing of animals, which
wouldn&rsquo;t be warranted if we grant animal agents a right to make
their own decisions about how their life should go.</p>

<h2 id="MoraSignAnimMoraClai">2. The Moral Significance of Animals&rsquo; Moral Claims</h2>

<p>
Knowing that an animal has moral status only tells us that she is owed
some moral consideration, but does not indicate how exactly she ought
to be treated. In order to work out this issue, at least two further
questions need to be addressed. A first question concerns the
interests that an animal has, that is, what makes her life go well or
badly for her. The second question concerns how to assess
animals&rsquo; moral claims and how to weigh them against conflicting
claims. We will now briefly consider each of these questions.</p>

<h3>2.1 What Interests Do Animals Have?</h3>

<p>
In order to know how we ought to treat an animal, we need to know what
would make her life go better or worse. In other words, we need to
know what her interests are. The word &lsquo;interests&rsquo; is not
meant to refer exclusively to the animal&rsquo;s subjective
(&lsquo;felt&rsquo;) preferences, but rather to everything in which
she has a stake, which may include objective as well as subjective
goods. Different value theories give different accounts of what these
goods are. Within animal ethics, there are three main approaches: (1)
hedonism, (2) preference-satisfaction theories, and (3) objective list
theories. (See also the SEP entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/">well-being</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Hedonistic theories consider that there is only one thing that is good
&ndash; pleasure (broadly understood to encompass all positive
affective states), and only one thing that is bad &ndash;  pain
(broadly understood to encompass all negative affective states). It
simply seems intuitive that pleasure is good and that pain is bad for
all beings who can experience pleasure and pain. Its simplistic
character has made hedonism a popular value theory in much
contemporary animal ethics. </p>

<p>
This situation contrasts with contemporary human ethics, where
hedonism is now thought to be a rather marginal axiology that has
quite counterintuitive implications. One of the most widely cited
thought experiments to illustrate the counterintuitive nature of
hedonism is Robert Nozick&rsquo;s ([1974] 2013) experience machine, an
imaginary device that would give whomever plugged into it all the
pleasurable experiences they like. That most of us would refuse to
give up our lives to plug into such a machine is meant to illustrate
that there&rsquo;s more to a good life than pleasure and the absence
of pain. </p>

<p>
Animal ethicists who adhere to hedonism often embrace its
counterintuitive implications. For instance, hedonism entails that the
main problem involved in farming animals for food is the fact that
animal agriculture generates vast amounts of suffering. This has led
some proponents of this theory to argue that an acceptable solution
for farmed animals&rsquo; plight would be to genetically engineer, or
disenhance, them to make them incapable of experiencing any pain
(McMahan 2008; Shriver 2009; Shriver &amp; McConnachie 2018). Others
have defended the need for large-scale interventions in nature to
reduce wild animal suffering or even &lsquo;engineer paradise&rsquo;
wherever possible (Horta 2010; Kianpour &amp; Paez 2022; Faria 2023).
Yet others have embraced the view that it&rsquo;s legitimate to
deprive animals of their freedom so long as they do not suffer
(Cochrane 2012) or that hedonism, coupled with utilitarianism, might
entail a need to give moral priority to the creation of large amounts
of small sentient animals, such as insects (Sebo 2023).</p>

<p>
Although the simplicity of hedonism has an undeniable appeal, many
reject its counterintuitive implications and find it to impoverish the
notion of well-being by reducing it to pleasurable affective states.
An alternative is provided by preference-satisfaction theories, which
don&rsquo;t determine a priori the contents of a good life, but rather
assume that well-being consists of the satisfaction of whichever
preferences one happens to have. Within animal ethics, Peter
Singer&rsquo;s Animal Liberation provided a strong defense of
preference-satisfaction accounts of well-being, although Singer
himself now endorses hedonism (Lazari-Radec &amp; Singer 2016).</p>

<p>
Preference-satisfaction accounts of well-being are subjective and
pluralistic. These accounts have the problem that, while we all want
our preferences satisfied, the satisfaction of our preferences
isn&rsquo;t always good for us. Take the obvious example of smoking.
An addicted smoker has a preference to smoke, but given the
health-risks associated with this activity it&rsquo;s hard to see how
smoking would contribute to her well-being. Further, not all
preferences are formed under ideal conditions. One might be deceived,
tricked, indoctrinated, or otherwise manipulated into having a
preference that isn&rsquo;t actually good for them. This seems
particularly relevant in the case of domesticated animals, who have
been bred for docility for millenia and might not always have the
preferences that would most contribute to their well-being. A dog with
an abusive owner, for instance, might have the will to please him
rather than the preference of fighting back or running away, even
though the latter would be better for her. We can also imagine
instances of animals being trained or conditioned to have preferences
whose fulfillment is bad for them, as might be the case of roosters
who are trained to fight.</p>

<p>
This generates the need for some theoretical qualification to ensure
that the preferences in question are adequate. One option is to claim
that only those preferences whose satisfaction leads to a net balance
of pleasure over pain actually contribute to one&rsquo;s well-being,
but then the theory collapses into hedonism, since what ultimately
matters is the pleasure generated, and the satisfaction of our
preferences becomes a mere instrumental good (Appleby &amp;
Sand&oslash;e 2023). Another option is to claim that the preferences
that contribute to well-being are those formed under adequate
epistemic circumstances, which has often been interpreted as requiring
that the individual be fully informed and that her preferences be her
own autonomous choice. However, different authors have doubted that
animals can form preferences in this sort of autonomous way (Korsgaard
2006, Bruckner 2021), which would imply that we may often have to
decide on behalf of animals what a good life would look like for them.
Those rejecting this kind of paternalism will be faced with the
challenge of determining animals&rsquo; preferences, which is
notoriously difficult even for species whose psychology has been
extensively studied (Kirkden &amp; Pajor 2006).</p>

<p>
Some animal ethicists have opted for objective list accounts of
well-being. According to this kind of value theory, there is a list of
objective goods or opportunities that are central to living a good
life. This list will typically include pleasure, but other goods as
well, such as knowledge, autonomy, achievements, or friendship.
Objective list theories identify goods that contribute value to an
individual&rsquo;s life regardless of whether she personally values
and desires them or whether each of them brings a net balance of
pleasure over pain.</p>

<p>
Martha Nussbaum (2006) offers a list of central capabilities whose
exercise is essential for an animal to flourish as the sort of being
she is, and which includes life; bodily health; bodily integrity;
senses, imagination, and thought; emotions; practical reason;
affiliation; play; and control over one&rsquo;s environment. As a
result of growing evidence regarding many animals&rsquo;
psychological, behavioral, and social complexity, other goods have
been added to the list, such as freedom (Schmidt 2015; Giroux 2016;
Wilcox 2020b), dignity (Cataldi 2002; Gruen 2014), meaning (Purves
&amp; Delon 2018; Thomas 2018; Hauskeller 2020; Abbate 2023), culture
(Fitzpatrick &amp; Andrews 2022), and care (Mons&oacute; et al. 2018;
Benz-Schwarzburg &amp; Wrage 2023).</p>

<p>
Although objective list theories have some advantages over hedonism
and preference-satisfaction theories, they also have a clear drawback:
it&rsquo;s very difficult to ground the objective value of these
goods. While in the case of pleasure we can appeal to its positive
phenomenology and in the case of preference satisfaction we can appeal
to the fact that whatever is desired is what the individual wants in
her life, in the case of these goods no such shortcut exists. Some,
like Nussbaum, appeal to the norm of the species to ground the list of
goods, but there is a danger of committing a naturalistic fallacy
here, since what is natural for a species is often contentious and
need not necessarily be good for any individual. For instance, it may
be considered natural for stags to fight but fighting probably
doesn&rsquo;t contribute to the good life for a stag, given injury,
infection, and death that can result. Although there are theoretical
tools one can use to circumvent these worries, proponents of objective
list theories need to be wary of projecting an anthropocentric ideal
of a good life onto animals.</p>

<h3>2.2 How to Count Animals&rsquo; Moral Claims</h3>

<p>
That non-human animals can make moral claims on us does not in itself
indicate how such claims are to be assessed and conflicting claims
adjudicated. Being morally considerable is like showing up on a moral
radar screen&mdash;how strong the signal is or where it is located on
the screen are separate questions. Of course, how one argues for the
moral considerability of non-human animals will inform how we are to
understand the force of an animal&rsquo;s claims.</p>

<p>
According to the view that an animal&rsquo;s moral claim is equivalent
to a moral right, any action that fails to treat the animal as a being
with inherent worth would violate that animal&rsquo;s right and is
thus morally objectionable. According to the animal rights position,
to treat an animal as a means to some human end, as many humans do
when they eat animals or experiment on them, is to violate that
animal&rsquo;s right. As Tom Regan has written:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;animals are treated routinely, systematically as if their
value were reducible to their usefulness to others, they are
routinely, systematically treated with a lack of respect, and thus are
their rights routinely, systematically violated. (Regan 1985: 24).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Any practice that fails to respect the rights of those animals who
have them, e.g., eating animals, hunting animals, experimenting on
animals, using animals for entertainment, is wrong, irrespective of
human need, context, or culture. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that it may
not sometimes be justified to violate an animal&rsquo;s rights, if the
circumstances are dire enough and rights are in conflict. What is
distinct about the rights position is that the violation of a right is
still wrong, even if it can be justified in particular circumstances.
And this means that the story doesn&rsquo;t end there, but rather that
certain forward-looking duties are generated in the moment a right is
violated, duties that may call for the need to compensate the victims
or to work towards ensuring that the circumstances that led to rights
violations never arise again.</p>

<p>
The animal rights theory that most characteristically incorporates the
obligations that arise as a result of various relations is Donaldson
and Kymlicka&rsquo;s <em>Zoopolis</em> (2011). Donaldson and Kymlicka
argue that rights apply differently to different animals who have
moral status. While all sentient animals hold the same basic negative
rights, meaning they are protected against killing, torture, slavery,
and confinement, other rights arise as a result of the different
relations that humans have had with specific animals. Domesticated
animals, whom we have historically forced into a relationship of
dependence with us, are owed the status of citizens. This means that
they are full-blown members of our communities, which entails that we
have specific duties towards them, such as a duty to socialize them
properly, to give them free access to public spaces, to protect them
from harm, to provide them medical care, or to ensure that their
preferences are taken into account when making political decisions. In
contrast, wild animals are owed a right to sovereignty over the
territories they occupy, which means that they must be protected
against colonization, invasion, and exploitation, as well as against
any paternalistic management on our behalf. Donaldson and Kymlicka
also discuss liminal animals, like squirrels and deer and racoons, who
live in human spaces but aren&rsquo;t domesticated. These animals,
Donaldson and Kymlicka argue, are owed the status of denizens, which
means that they have a right to secure residency once they have
settled in our communities and their interests must be taken into
account when designing our cities, but they have fewer rights and
obligations than domesticated animals (not being entitled, for
instance, to a protection from predation, nor being obligated to
become socialized).</p>

<p>
The utilitarian position on animals, most commonly associated with
Peter Singer and popularly, though erroneously, referred to as an
animal rights position, is actually quite distinct. Here the moral
significance of the claims of animals depends on what other morally
significant competing claims might be in play in any given situation.
While the equal interests of all morally considerable beings are
considered equally, the practices in question may end up violating or
frustrating some interests but would not be considered morally wrong
if, when all equal interests are considered, more of these interests
are satisfied than frustrated. For utilitarians like Singer, what
matters are the strength and nature of interests, not whose interests
these are. So, if the only options available in order to save the life
of one morally considerable being is to cause harm, but not death, to
another morally considerable being, then according to a utilitarian
position, causing this harm may be morally justifiable. Similarly, if
there are two courses of action, one which causes extreme amounts of
suffering and ultimate death, and one which causes much less suffering
and painless death, then the latter would be morally preferable to the
former.</p>

<p>
Consider factory farming, the most common method used to convert
animal bodies into relatively inexpensive food in industrialized
societies today. An estimated 8 billion animals in the United States
are born, confined, biologically manipulated, transported and
ultimately slaughtered each year so that humans can consume them. The
conditions in which these animals are raised and the method of
slaughter causes vast amounts of suffering (see, for example, Safran
Foer 2010, Singer 2023). Given that animals suffer under such
conditions and assuming that suffering is not in their interests, then
the practice of factory farming would only be morally justifiable if
its abolition were to cause greater suffering or a greater amount of
interest frustration. Certainly humans who take pleasure in eating
animals will find it harder to satisfy these interests in the absence
of factory farms; it may cost more and require more effort to obtain
animal products. The factory farmers, and the industries that support
factory farming, will also have certain interests frustrated if
factory farming were to be abolished. How much interest frustration
and interest satisfaction would be associated with the end to factory
farming is largely an empirical question. But utilitarians are not
making unreasonable predictions when they argue that on balance the
suffering and interest frustration that animals experience in modern
day meat production is greater than the suffering that humans would
endure if they had to alter their current practices.</p>

<p>
Importantly, the utilitarian argument for the moral significance of
animal suffering in meat production is not an argument for
vegetarianism. If an animal lived a happy life and was painlessly
killed and then eaten by people who would otherwise suffer hunger or
malnutrition by not eating the animal, then painlessly killing and
eating the animal would be the morally justified thing to do. In many
parts of the world where economic, cultural, or climate conditions
make it virtually impossible for people to sustain themselves on plant
based diets, killing and eating animals that previously led relatively
unconstrained lives and are painlessly killed, would not be morally
objectionable. The utilitarian position can thus avoid certain charges
of cultural chauvinism and moralism, charges that the animal rights
position apparently cannot avoid.</p>

<p>
It might be objected that to suggest that it is morally acceptable to
hunt and eat animals for those people living in Arctic regions, or for
nomadic cultures, or for poor rural peoples, for example, is to
potentially condone painlessly killing other morally considerable
beings, like humans, for food consumption in similar situations. If
violating the rights of an animal can be morally tolerated, especially
a right to life, then similar rights violations can be morally
tolerated. In failing to recognize the inviolability of the moral
claims of all morally considerable beings, utilitarianism cannot
accommodate one of our most basic prima facie principles, namely that
killing a morally considerable being is wrong.</p>

<p>
There are at least two replies to this sort of objection. The first
appeals to the negative side effects that killing may promote. If, to
draw on an overused and sadly sophomoric counter-example, one person
can be kidnapped and painlessly killed in order to provide body parts
for four individuals who will die without them, there will inevitably
be negative side-effects that all things considered would make the
kidnapping wrong. Healthy people, knowing they could be used for spare
parts, might make themselves unhealthy to avoid such a fate or they
may have so much stress and fear that the overall state of affairs
would be worse than that in which four people died. Appealing to
side-effects when it comes to the wrong of killing is certainly
plausible, but it fails to capture what is directly wrong with
killing.</p>

<p>
A more satisfying reply would have us adopt what might be called a
multi-factor perspective, one that takes into account the kinds of
interest that are possible for certain kinds of morally considerable
beings, the content of interests of the beings in question, their
relative weight, and the context of those who have them. Consider a
seal who has spent his life freely roaming the oceans and ice flats
and who is suddenly and painlessly killed to provide food for a human
family struggling to survive a bitter winter in far northern climes.
While it is probably true that the seal had an immediate interest in
avoiding suffering, it is less clear that the seal has a future
directed interest in continued existence. If the seal lacks this
future directed interest, then painlessly killing him does not violate
this interest. The same cannot be said for the human explorer who
finds himself face to face with a hungry family. Persons generally
have interests in continued existence, interests that, arguably,
non-persons do not have. So one factor that can be appealed to is that
non-persons may not have the range of interests that persons do.</p>

<p>
An additional factor is the type of interest in question. We can think
of interests as scalar; crucial interests are weightier than important
interests, important interests are weightier than replaceable
interests, and all are weightier than trivial interests or mere whims.
When there is a conflict of interests, crucial interests will always
override important interests, important interests will always override
replaceable interests, etc. So if an animal has an interest in not
suffering, which is arguably a crucial interest, or at least an
important one, and a person has an interest in eating that animal when
there are other things to eat, meaning that interest is replaceable,
then the animal has the stronger interest and it would be wrong to
violate that interest by killing the animal for food if there is
another source of food available.</p>

<p>
Often, however, conflicts of interests are within the same category.
The Inuit&rsquo;s interest in food is crucial and the explorer&rsquo;s
interest in life is crucial. If we assume that the explorer cannot
otherwise provide food for the hunter, then it looks as if there is a
conflict within the same category. If you take the interests of an
indigenous hunter&rsquo;s whole family into account, then their
combined interest in their own survival appears to outweigh the
hapless explorer&rsquo;s interest in continued existence. Indeed, if
painlessly killing and eating the explorer were the only way for the
family to survive, then perhaps this action would be morally condoned.
But this is a rather extreme sort of example, one in which even our
deepest held convictions are strained. So it is quite hard to know
what to make of the clash between what a utilitarian would condone and
what our intuitions tell us we should believe here. Our most basic
prima facie principles arise and are accepted under ordinary
circumstances. Extraordinary circumstances are precisely those in
which such principles or precepts give
 way.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The multi-factor utilitarian perspective is particularly helpful when
considering the use of animals in medical research. According to the
animal rights position, the use of animals in experimental procedures
is a clear violation of their rights&mdash;they are being used as a
mere means to some possible end&mdash;and thus animal rights
proponents are in favor of the abolition of all laboratory research.
The utilitarian position, particularly one that incorporates some kind
of multi-factor perspective, might allow some research on animals
under very specific conditions. Before exploring what a utilitarian
might condone in the way of animal experimentation, let us first
quickly consider what would be morally prohibited. All research that
involves invasive procedures, constant confinement, and ultimate death
can be said to violate the animal&rsquo;s crucial interests. Thus any
experiments that are designed to enhance the important, replaceable,
or trivial interests of humans or other animals would be prohibited.
That would mean that experiments for cosmetics or household products
are prohibited, as there are non-animal tested alternatives and many
options already available for consumers. Certain psychological
experiments, such as those in which infant primates are separated from
their mothers and exposed to frightening stimuli in an effort to
understand problems teenagers have when they enter high school, would
also come into question. There are many examples of experiments that
violate an animal&rsquo;s crucial interests in the hopes of satisfying
the lesser interests of some other morally considerable being, all of
which would be objectionable from this perspective.</p>

<p>
There are some laboratory experiments, however, that from a
multi-factor utilitarian perspective may be permitted. These are
experiments in which the probability of satisfying crucial or
important interests for many who suffer from some debilitating or
fatal disease is high, and the numbers of non-human animals whose
crucial interests are violated is low. The psychological complexity of
the non-humans may also be significant in determining whether the
experiment is morally justified. In the case of experimenting in this
limited number of cases, presumably a parallel argument could be made
about experimenting on humans. If the chances are very high that
experimenting on one human, who is a far superior experimental animal
when it comes to human disease, can prevent great suffering or death
in many humans, then the utilitarian may, if side effects are minimal,
condone such an experiment. Of course, it is easier to imagine this
sort of extreme case in the abstract, what a utilitarian would think
actually morally justified again depends on the specific empirical
data.</p>

<p>
In sum, the animal rights position takes the significance of morally
considerable claims to be absolute. Thus, any use of animals that
involves a disregard for their moral claims is problematic. The
significance of an animal&rsquo;s morally considerable interests
according to a utilitarian is variable. Whether an action is morally
justified or permissible will depend on a number of factors. The
utilitarian position on animals would condemn a large number of
practices that involve the suffering and death of billions of animals,
but there are cases in which some use of non-human animals, and
perhaps even human animals, may be morally justified (Gruen 2021: ch.
4; Gilbert, Kaebnick, &amp; Murray 2012). In contrast to the framing
of these cases within an animal rights theory, for utilitarians no
forward-looking duties to repair the harm done are generated in these
kinds of circumstances, since all that is required of moral agents is
to choose the course of action that generates the most good.</p>

<h2 id="AltePersHumaRelaOtheAnim">3. Alternative Perspectives on Human Relations to Other Animals</h2>

<p>
Given the long-standing view that non-humans are mere things, there
are still many who reject the arguments presented here for the moral
considerability of non-humans and the significance of their interests.
Nonetheless, most now realize that the task of arguing that humans
have a unique and exclusive moral status is rather difficult. Yet even
amongst those who do view animals as within the sphere of moral
concern, there is disagreement about the nature and usefulness of the
arguments presented on behalf of the moral status of animals.</p>

<p>
Increasingly, philosophers are arguing that while our behavior towards
animals is indeed subject to moral scrutiny, the kinds of ethical
arguments that are usually presented frame the issues in the wrong
way. Some philosophers suggest that rational argumentation fails to
capture those features of moral experience that allow us to really see
why treating animals badly is wrong. The point, according to
philosophers such as Stephen R.L. Clark (1977) and Cora Diamond
(2001), for example, is that members of our communities, however we
conceive of them, pull on us and it is in virtue of this pull that we
recognize what is wrong with cruelty. Animals are individuals with
whom we share a common life and this recognition allows us to see them
as they are. Eating animals is wrong not because it is a violation of
the animal&rsquo;s rights or because on balance such an act creates
more suffering than other acts, but rather because in eating animals
or using them in other harmful, violent ways, we do not display the
traits of character that kind, sensitive, compassionate, mature, and
thoughtful members of a moral community should display.</p>

<p>
According to some in the virtue ethics tradition, carefully worked out
arguments in which the moral considerability and moral significance of
animals are laid out will have little if any grip on our thoughts and
actions. Rather, by perceiving the attitudes that underlie the use and
abuse of non-human animals as shallow or cruel, one interested in
living a virtuous life will change their attitudes and come to reject
treating animals as food or tools for research. As Rosalind Hursthouse
recognized after having been exposed to alternative ways of seeing
animals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I began to see [my attitudes] that related to my conception of
flesh-foods as unnecessary, greedy, self-indulgent, childish, my
attitude to shopping and cooking in order to produce lavish dinner
parties as parochial, gross, even dissolute. I saw my interest and
delight in nature programmes about the lives of animals on television
and my enjoyment of meat as side by side at odds with one
another&hellip;Without thinking animals had rights, I began to see
both the wild ones and the ones we usually eat as having lives of
their own, which they should be left to enjoy. And so I changed. My
perception of the moral landscape and where I and the other animals
were situated in it shifted. (Hursthouse 2000: 165&ndash;166; see also
Diamond 2001 [especially chs. 11 and 13], and Clarke 1977)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alice Crary argues that shifting perceptions of our moral landscapes
occur because these landscapes, and more precisely the rich worlds of
those who inhabit them, are not morally neutral. The characteristics
that philosophers tend to look for in other animals to determine
whether or not they are morally considerable, according to Crary, are
already infused with moral importance, &ldquo;human beings and other
animals have empirically discoverable moral characteristics&rdquo;
(2016: 85) that are, as she puts it, &ldquo;inside ethics&rdquo;.
These values often sneak in under a supposedly neutral gloss. By
explicitly locating these characteristics inside ethics, the texture,
quality, and purposes of our ethical reflection on moral
considerability changes. Arriving at an adequate empirical
understanding requires non-neutral methods, identifying historical and
cultural perspectives as shaping how we consider other animals
morally. What ethical questions we think are important and how we
frame and answer them, will be different if we see our lives and the
lives of other animals as already imbued with moral values.</p>

<p>
Other feminist philosophers have taken issue with the supposedly
morally neutral methods of argumentation used to establish the moral
status of animals. For many feminists the traditional methods of
rational argumentation fail to take into account the feelings of
sympathy or empathy that humans have towards non-humans, feelings they
believe are central to a full account of what we owe non-humans and
why (see Adams &amp; Donovan 1995; Donovan &amp; Adams 2007; Adams
&amp; Gruen 2022).</p>

<p>
Feminist philosophers have also challenged the individualism that is
central in the arguments for the moral status of animals. Rather than
identifying intrinsic or innate properties that non-humans share with
humans, some feminists have argued instead that we ought to understand
moral status in relational terms given that moral recognition is
invariably a social practice. As Elizabeth Anderson has written:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Moral considerability is not an intrinsic property of any creature,
nor is it supervenient on only its intrinsic properties, such as its
capacities. It depends, deeply, on the kind of relations they can have
with us. (Anderson 2004: 289).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And these relationships needn&rsquo;t be direct. The reach of human
activity has expanded across the entire globe and humans are entangled
with each other and other animals in myriad ways. We participate in
activities and institutions that directly or indirectly harm others by
creating negative experiences, depriving them of their well-being, or
denying them opportunities to be who they are and pursue what they
care about. Philosophers Elisa Aaltola (2018) and Lori Gruen (2015)
have argued for refining our empathetic imagination in order to
improve our relationships with each other and other animals.</p>

<p>
Even though it is challenging to understand what it is like to be
another, and even though we are limited by our inevitable
anthropocentric perspectives, being in respectful ethical relation
involves attempting to understand and respond to another&rsquo;s
needs, interests, desires, vulnerabilities, hopes, and perspectives.
What Gruen calls, &ldquo;entangled empathy&rdquo; is a process that
involves both affect and cognition (Gruen 2015). Individuals who are
empathizing with others respond to the other&rsquo;s condition and
reflectively imagine themselves in the distinct position of the other
while staying attentive to both similarities and differences between
herself and her situation and that of the fellow creature with whom
she is empathizing. Entangled empathy involves paying critical
attention to the broader conditions that may negatively affect the
experiences and flourishing of those with whom one is empathizing, and
this requires those of us empathizing to attend to things we might not
have otherwise. It could also help us to enhance our own
experiences, develop our moral imagination, and become more
sensitive perceivers.</p>
