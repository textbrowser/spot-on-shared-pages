<h1>Animal Communication</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Oct 23, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
It is intuitive to think that animals communicate. This intuition
shapes our everyday interactions with animals, and guides much
empirical and theoretical research. Pet owners take their cats&rsquo;
meows to be requests for food, and interpret their dogs&rsquo; play
bows as invitations to play. Meanwhile, scholars argue that bees use
their dances to communicate information about the location of food,
and that the flashing behaviours of fireflies communicate sexual
availability to potential mates. But what is animal communication?
While it may seem obvious to us that animals communicate, it is more
difficult to say what makes their behaviours communicative. Existing
theoretical accounts characterise &lsquo;communication&rsquo; in
different and inconsistent ways.</p>

<p>
Biological accounts of animal communication define communicative
signals as products of natural selection (Dawkins &amp; Krebs 1978;
Maynard Smith &amp; Harper 2003). In the words of Maynard Smith and
Harper, signals are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Any act or structure which [i] alters the behaviour of other
organisms, which [ii] evolved because of that effect, and which [iii]
is effective because the receiver&rsquo;s response has also evolved
(Maynard Smith and Harper 2003: 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this definition, signals that are not adapted for communication do
not count as communicative. This would include the words and sentences
of languages (Fr&ouml;hlich &amp; van Schaik 2020).</p>

<p>
Animal signals are sometimes characterised in informational terms, too
(Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012; Scarantino &amp; Clay 2015).
Informational frameworks conceptualise communicative interactions as
signal-mediated processes of information transmission. In these
frameworks, a signal carries &lsquo;information&rsquo; about a state
if it correlates statistically with that state, such that the
occurrence of one thing changes the probability of another (Scarantino
2015). For example, for an eagle alarm call to carry information about
the presence of an eagle, the occurrence of eagle alarm calls must
reduce uncertainty about the presence of eagles (i.e., make the
presence of eagles more likely).</p>

<p>
While informational accounts do not place any constraints on what
mechanisms govern signal production, voluntary (or
&lsquo;intentional&rsquo;) signal production is a bedrock of human
accounts of communication. These include Gricean accounts of
communication, which make it a requirement that communicative acts are
not only produced voluntarily, but with a distinctive set of
intentions (Grice 1957, 1989; Sperber &amp; Wilson 1995;
Scott-Phillips 2015). Many events that satisfy the informational
definition of a communicative act are not counted as communicative by
intentionalist approaches, because they are not voluntarily produced.
While some animal signals are produced intentionally, it remains
controversial whether they are produced with Gricean intentions
 (<a href="#GriPra">&sect;4.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
For these reasons, finding a unified theoretical framework for
characterising human and animal communication may be less than
straightforward (Palazzolo forthcoming). Alternative approaches offer
inconsistent accounts of what communication is, and make it hard to
say why animal behaviours that look communicative are. Perhaps cases
of human and animal communication are examples of a family resemblance
notion (Wittgenstein 1953). Were this the case, an all-encompassing
characterisation of communication may not be possible, as putatively
communicative behaviours may not be united by any set of individually
necessary and jointly sufficient conditions. But even here it should
be possible to say something about the features of human and animal
behaviours that make them similar. We will discuss such attempts in
the final part of this essay. Before doing that, because the field has
largely been disunited up to now, we give a topographical overview of
the ways in which animal communication has been theorised by
philosophers and cognitive scientists, and spell out the connections
between these approaches. This should give readers a framework for
navigating the existing empirical and philosophical literature.</p>

<h2 id="Int">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="WhyStuAniCom">1.1 Why Study Animal Communication?</h3>

<p>
Broadly speaking there are two reasons why animal communication is
studied: as a way of better understanding human communication, and as
a way of understanding animals.</p>

<p>
Recent discussions have skewed towards the former approach (Lloyd
2004; Tomasello 2008; Bar-On 2013; Scott-Phillips 2015; Moore 2017a),
often motivated by the idea that understanding animal communication
can inform the study of language evolution. The idea underlying this
research is we can think of animal forms of communication as involving
potentially simpler forms of the kinds of communication in which
humans engage. Models of the mechanisms that support animal
communication might then be used to model how human communication has
grown in complexity from its more animalistic origins. Points of
continuity and discontinuity, particularly the latter, can be used to
help identify what has changed in evolutionary history, and may also
give us a basis for reasoning about the conditions that drove the
evolution of human features of communication.</p>

<p>
Thinking of this project in purely functional terms, modelling the
transitions from simple to complex forms of communication, comes with
a number of risks. The assumptions that human communication is more
complex than animal communication and that human and animal forms of
communication are built on the same cognitive foundations may both be
false. With increased understanding of the natural world, we are
learning that highly complex minds can come in forms very different
from our own (Godfrey-Smith 2016). Nonetheless, through the study of
common ancestry, we can use models of animal communication to inform
the study of human minds.</p>

<p>
In the study of phylogenetic development&mdash;that is, the biological
development and diversification of organisms over historical
time&mdash;a reasonable assumption is that behaviours present in
closely related species were also present in the common ancestor of
those species (Sober 2005, 2012). Put another way, if two closely
related species share similar traits, it is reasonable to assume that
these traits derive from a common ancestral trait, or are
&lsquo;homologous&rsquo; (Ruse &amp; Travis 2009, Alphabetical guide).
While this assumption is defeasible, it&rsquo;s cladistically more
parsimonious to suppose that similar behaviours in closely related
species evolved once in an ancestral lineage rather than twice,
independently, in later lineages. So if gestural communication is
present in all extant great ape species (humans, bonobos, chimpanzees,
gorillas, and orangutans), then this is evidence, albeit defeasible,
that gestural communication was also present in the last common
ancestor of these species around 16mya. The argument from cladistic
parsimony generalises to consideration of the mechanisms that support
similar behaviours in closely related clades. Where similar behaviours
are present in neighbouring clades, then this is evidence (albeit
defeasible evidence) that these behaviours are supported by common
mechanisms (Sober 2012).</p>

<p>
Appeals to common ancestry thus provide a method for reconstructing
the phylogenetic development of human communication. Were
reconstructing the evolution of human communication the only reason to
study animal communication, this would give more reason to study the
communication of closely related species, like chimpanzees and
bonobos, than more distant ones&mdash;like dolphins, dogs, and birds.
But if there are similar mechanisms at work in more distantly related
species, then we can still gain insight into the potentially
phylogenetically ancient foundations of human communication; or into
the ways that convergent evolution can support the independent
emergence of functionally similar traits in distantly related clades.
Such traits may turn out to be &lsquo;analogous&rsquo; to those
present in the hominin lineage. Unlike homologous traits, analogous
traits are similar not because of a shared ancestry, but because, for
example, they arose in response to similar environmental pressures
(Ruse &amp; Travis 2009, Alphabetical guide).</p>

<p>
Of course, self-knowledge is not the only reason to study animal
communication. Some philosophers reject the anthropocentrism of
thinking that we should study animals to better understand ourselves
(Mons&oacute; 2021). We may also want to understand animal
communication as a means of understanding <em>them</em>&mdash;either
because doing so is intrinsically interesting, or with some further
purpose in mind. When looking at animal communication as a way of
understanding animals, the focus is not on the differences and
similarities with human communication, but rather on the intrinsic
properties of animal communicative systems, minds and behaviours.
Studying the communicative interactions that take place within and
between animal species in their natural habitats can tell us a great
deal about the lives that they live, the ways in which they interact,
and the ways in which we might better interact with them. Studying
minds radically different from our own can also tell us something
about minds in general, and the very different forms that cognition
can take.</p>

<p>
There may also be practical incentives to study the minds of creatures
less closely related to us&mdash;not least, for example, domesticated
species, and species kept as companion animals. A better understanding
of the communication of the animals with whom we share our cities and
homes might enable us to improve their living conditions and give them
the lives that they deserve (Donaldson &amp; Kymlicka 2011). For
example, knowing how to interpret cats&rsquo; behaviour, and how cats
are likely to interpret us, could enable us to live more harmoniously
with them, improving their standard of living, while helping us to
build deeper and more meaningful relationships with them. Meanwhile,
by better understanding the communication of farm animals, we may
better understand when they are suffering and when they are content,
facilitating the raising of healthier, happier livestock. Finally, by
better understanding the minds of wild animals, we may be better able
to educate humankind about the lives they lead, and thus motivate our
peers to care about these species. In turn, this might support
initiatives designed to protect their natural habits from
destruction.</p>

<p>
While both human and animal-centric approaches are important, in this
entry we will look at animal communication primarily via competing
accounts of its differences and similarities with human communication,
i.e., within the framework of language evolution. We do not wish to
downplay the importance of animal-centric approaches. Rather, the
evolutionary approach reflects our own research backgrounds.
Furthermore, this comparative approach is the one on which most
philosophical debates have focused&mdash;and, therefore, which lends
itself to a more systematic treatment in a philosophy entry. It also
means that, although we try to diversify our examples, many examples
are taken from the primate literature. Given our close evolutionary
relationship, scholars have often preferred looking to primates to
reconstruct the evolution of human language.</p>

<h3 id="VarAppSemSynPraCoo">1.2 Varying approaches to semantics, syntax, pragmatics and cooperation</h3>

<p>
This entry is organised into four main sections: semantics, syntax,
pragmatics and cooperation.</p>

<p>
Since the categories of semantics, syntax and pragmatics are
foundational to the study of human communication, we use them to
present different accounts of the similarities and differences between
human and animal communication. While the meanings of these terms are
not always a matter of consensus, in this entry we use them in a
manner consistent with the literature on human communication. Thus,
<em>semantics</em> is the study of the meaning or information carried
by individual signs, as in the study of word meaning
 (<a href="#Sem">&sect;2</a>).
 <em>Syntax</em> is the study of the way in which individual signs can
be combined into structured, meaningful strings of signs, as when
words are combined into sentences
 (<a href="#Syn">&sect;3</a>).
 <em>Pragmatics</em> is the study of the ways in which signs are used
and interpreted in context. For example, an utterance of the sentence
&ldquo;Leave me alone now&rdquo; conveys a different proposition,
depending on who utters it, and when
 (<a href="#Pra">&sect;4</a>).</p>
 
<p>

 <a href="#CooAniCom">Section 5</a>
 focuses on the extent to which animal communication is cooperative,
and introduces a series of debates that are key both for understanding
recent work on language evolution, and for better understanding
interactions between animals.</p>

<p>
As will become apparent, the usage of technical terms such as
semantics, syntax, pragmatics and cooperation varies considerably in
the animal communication literature. This is partly because different
subfields of animal communication research have developed
independently, and because philosophers and cognitive scientists have
used the same words in different ways. Different uses of the same
words sometimes also relate to issues of ideology. For example, it may
depend on whether an author takes a &lsquo;booster&rsquo; or a
&lsquo;scoffer&rsquo; position (see Andrews &amp; Huss 2014; Andrews
&amp; Mons&oacute; 2021 for discussion). What we call
&lsquo;booster&rsquo; views tend to elaborate human-like
interpretations of animal behaviours, emphasising similar cognitive
abilities in human and non-human species. In contrast, scoffer views
lean towards simpler interpretations that emphasise cognitively
undemanding processes. Proponents of different approaches often use
the same words in different ways, and without acknowledging their
idiosyncratic use. This can make navigating the literature in animal
communication challenging. In the course of this entry, we&rsquo;ll
illustrate the different ways in which technical terms have been used,
and set out to show the relationships between competing views.</p>

<h2 id="Sem">2. Semantics</h2>

<p>
Semantics is the study of the meaning or information carried by
individual signs, as in the study of word meaning. A general and
vigorously debated approach to the question of animal semantics is to
examine what animal signals mean, and whether they could be said to
refer.</p>

<h3 id="FunRef">2.1 Functional reference</h3>

<p>
The theory of functional reference (Marler, Evans, &amp; Hauser 1992)
contends that there is evidence of primitive forms of reference in
animal communicative behaviours. &lsquo;Functionally
referential&rsquo; calls refer to objects or events in the
animal&rsquo;s environment. This makes them possible evolutionary
precursors of words. In claiming that animal signals have a
referential capacity, the theory of functional reference challenges
the classic &lsquo;motivational&rsquo; view of animal communication
(Darwin 1872 [1998]), according to which animal signals are more like
emotional expressions (e.g., laughter, or cries) than words, and have
no referential function.</p>

<p>
The textbook example of functional reference is the alarm calls of
vervet monkeys. As reported by Seyfarth, Cheney, and Marler (1980),
vervet monkeys produce three acoustically distinct types of alarm
calls in response to three different types of predators: leopards,
eagles, and snakes. The receivers of these calls are likely to adopt
escape strategies that are consistent with the presence of these
predators, as if they interpret the calls to mean
&ldquo;leopard!&rdquo;, &ldquo;eagle!&rdquo; or &ldquo;snake!&rdquo;.
Leopard alarm calls increase the likelihood that vervet monkeys will
run up into trees; eagle alarm calls lead to more individuals looking
skywards, before running into bushes; and when they hear snake alarm
calls, individuals are more likely to look down and stand bipedally.
These behavioural responses are seemingly consistent with vervet calls
having some word-like referential capacity.</p>

<p>
Within the theory of functional reference, the referentiality of
animal signals is defined as &ldquo;functional&rdquo; in the sense of
being neutral about the mental processes that support animal calls
(Marler, Evans, &amp; Hauser 1992). What makes functionally
referential animal signals similar to words&mdash;and, potentially,
their evolutionary precursors&mdash;is the fact that they are taken by
their recipients to stand for objects or events in the environment.
Since claims about functional reference are neutral with respect to
the mechanisms that support call production, this theoretical
framework can be used to study the various ways in which animals
provide members of their own and other species with information about
their shared environment. Thus it is a valuable tool for studying
communication between animals. It is also well suited for
characterising the findings of observational (e.g., ethological)
studies, which may be ill-suited to supporting conclusions about the
mechanisms underlying communication.</p>

<p>
According to early formulations of the functional reference view,
animal signals are functionally referential when they are (i)
stimulus-specific&mdash;i.e., produced by animals in response to
specific objects or events in the environment (the &lsquo;production
criterion&rsquo;); and (ii) context-independent&mdash;i.e., capable of
eliciting appropriate responses in the recipients in the absence of
contextual clues (the &lsquo;perception criterion&rsquo;) (Marler,
Evans, &amp; Hauser 1992; Macedonia &amp; Evans 1993). However, both
the formulation of these criteria and the general utility of the
functional reference framework have been challenged.</p>

<h4 id="CriFunRef">2.1.1 Criticisms of functional reference</h4>

<p>
The theory of functional reference has been challenged by a number of
scholars (e.g., Rendall, Owren, &amp; Ryan 2009; Wheeler &amp; Fischer
2012; Scarantino 2013). Wheeler and Fischer (2012) develop a two-part
objection. First, based on empirical evidence they suggest that
functional referential signals are at best a marginal phenomenon in
animal communication. In most cases, they argue, animal signals are
neither stimulus-specific nor context-independent: animals tend to
produce the same types of signals in response to different stimuli
(making them non-stimulus-specific); and communicative signals are
usually interpreted by animals in light of contextual clues (making
them non-context-independent). Ironically, they argue that
stimulus-specificity does not even seem to apply to vervet
monkeys&rsquo; alarm calls, because only calls given by males are well
characterised by the hypothesis that there are three distinct types of
alarm calls (Price et al. 2015). Second, Wheeler and Fischer argue
that even where signals are functionally referential, often they are
not voluntarily produced&mdash;undermining the proposal that they are
an evolutionary precursor of linguistic signs (see also Fischer &amp;
Price 2017). This view is supported by neurological evidence
suggesting that primates may lack the neural system which is
responsible for voluntary vocal control in humans (Fischer &amp;
Hammerschmidt 2020). In light of these objections Wheeler and Fischer
argue that animal psychologists should overcome their preoccupation
with functional reference and instead search for continuities between
human and non-human communication in the interpretation, not the
production, of signals. They propose to abandon the functional
reference framework in favour of a receiver-centred approach to animal
semantics (see
 <a href="#CarPra">&sect;4.1</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="DefFunRef">2.1.2 In defence of functional reference</h4>

<p>
Against Wheeler &amp; Fischer (2012), Scarantino (2013) and Scarantino
&amp; Clay (2015) defend the explanatory value of the functional
reference framework. They argue that the problem is not with the
framework itself, but only with the existing characterisation of
functional reference. They point out that while context-independence
and stimulus-specificity don&rsquo;t always apply to cases of animal
communication, they don&rsquo;t apply to cases of human linguistic
reference, either. Examples of this include indexicals like
&lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;you&rsquo;, &lsquo;today&rsquo; and
&lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, and &lsquo;this&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo;.
Such terms are produced in a variety of circumstances, and so lack
stimulus-specificity. Their interpretation therefore requires taking
into account contextual clues. Regardless, indexicals have a
referential function. This shows that referential capacity is not
dependent upon either stimulus specificity or context-independence.
Scarantino argues that the failure of animal signals to meet these
criteria is therefore insufficient to show that they do not refer, and
no reason to deny that such signals could be evolutionary precursors
of words.</p>

<p>
Scarantino also argues that animal signals don&rsquo;t need to be
stimulus-specific to be adaptive. This is because the cost of false
positive calls (e.g., calls given in the absence of a predator) may be
much less costly than false negatives (signals not given in the
presence of predator). For example, a receiver who responds to a
false-positive eagle alarm call with eagle-avoidance behaviour does
not incur damaging costs. It is more risky not to engage in
eagle-avoidance behaviour when an eagle is present. Thus, in many
cases it will be adaptive if eagle calls are given to stimuli other
than eagles.</p>

<p>
Drawing on the example of indexicals, Scarantino (2013) proposes a
revised characterisation, according to which</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Signals can functionally refer by virtue of contextual cues &hellip;
and in the absence of a strong correlation with their referents
&hellip;. (Scarantino 2013: 1012)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the original production criterion (Macedonia &amp; Evans 1993),
Scarantino&rsquo;s &lsquo;contextual information criterion&rsquo;
admits weak correlations between signals and referents, allowing
signals to be produced in a variety of circumstances, rather than
being stimulus-specific. On this formulation, a signal <em>X</em>
carries information about a state <em>Y</em> iff &ldquo;<em>X</em>s
are correlated with <em>Y</em>s (weakly or strongly)&rdquo;
(Scarantino 2013: 1014). In contrast to Macedonia &amp; Evans&rsquo;
(1993) perception criterion, Scarantino also suggests a
&lsquo;contextual perception criterion&rsquo;, according to which:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>X</em>&rsquo;s presentations in context <em>C</em> reliably cause
responses adaptive to <em>Y</em>s in the absence of <em>Y</em>s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He argues that calls functionally refer to things if they
statistically correlate with them, and if receivers have developed an
adaptive response to that correlation. This means that animal
behaviours functionally refer only if recipients respond to them in
ways that are adaptive. This is also possible via the integration of
contextual clues, in contrast to Macedonia and Evans (1993).</p>

<p>
On this approach, functional reference becomes a modified form of
&lsquo;natural meaning&rsquo; (Grice 1957; Scarantino 2015). On
Grice&rsquo;s account, something <em>X</em> naturally means that
<em>Y</em> if the presence of <em>X</em>s entails the presence of
<em>Y</em>s. Against Grice, Scarantino argues that it is sufficient
for <em>X</em> to naturally mean <em>Y</em> that it reliably indicates
the presence of <em>Y</em>. Thus he presents &lsquo;natural
meaning&rsquo; as a statistical relationship between two states of
affairs (Scarantino 2015)&mdash;e.g., a call, and the thing to which
that call is a response. Signals carry information about the states
with which their production is associated, and the probability of
which is changed by the occurrence of the calls (i.e., uncertainty
reduction). For example, the probability of an eagle being present is
raised by an eagle alarm call, such that the latter carries predictive
information about (or reduces uncertainty about) the presence of the
former. Significantly, Scarantino&rsquo;s theory of information is
neutral about what mechanisms underpin these correlations. The change
in probability occurs regardless of what psychological processes
govern the production of signals.</p>

<p>
Scarantino&rsquo;s revised account remains controversial. Wheeler and
Fischer (2015) object that his rehabilitated characterisation is too
broad to be useful in the study of language evolution, because many
intuitively non-communicative features of animals can potentially
statistically correlate with states of affairs in a context, and
elicit adaptive responses, such that they could be said to refer to
them (see Palazzolo 2024 for discussion).</p>

<p>
Despite their differences, Wheeler and Fischer&rsquo;s framework of
meaning attribution and Scarantino&rsquo;s revised account of
functional reference are united in one important respect: they both
argue that the interpretation of signals that are not produced
voluntarily can serve as a point of continuity between human and
animal communication, and thus is of value for the study of language
evolution. In
 <a href="#CarPra">section 4.1</a>,
 we discuss criticism of this claim by some philosophers (Bar-On &amp;
Moore 2017; Bar-On 2021).</p>

<p>
Whether or not it identifies a significant point of continuity with
linguistic reference, it should be noted that the framework of
functional reference has been very productive in animal communication
research. Forms of functional reference have been discovered in a wide
range of animal species, including monkeys, prairie dogs, meerkats,
chickens and bees (see Townsend &amp; Manser 2013; Gill &amp; Bierema
2013). Since the studies of von Frisch (1965 [1967]), for example, it
has been observed that bees&rsquo; waggle dances communicate
information about the direction, distance and abundance of a food
source with respect to the hive. Additionally, prairie dogs have been
shown to use four alarm call variants that vary consistently with
different predator types, including hawks, humans, coyotes, and dogs.
Alarm calls also vary based on specific physical attributes of the
predator (Slobodchikoff et al. 2009). While these findings would not
support claims about the psychological states of call producers, they
can be classified as functionally referential without fear of
misrepresenting the minds of their producers. Moreover, regardless of
the mechanisms underlying these interactions, the functional reference
framework has been used to show that many animal communication systems
are used to provide receivers with information about the
environment.</p>

<h3 id="DoAniKnoMeaWor">2.2 Do animals know the meaning of words?</h3>

<p>
Whether or not the concept of functional reference can be
rehabilitated for the study of language evolution, some have argued
that, for at least some species, animal researchers may have no need
for it (Palazzolo 2024)&mdash;because the animal kingdom contains
cases of reference proper. If that is right, we can look to these
cases to better understand the origins of linguistic reference. Here
&lsquo;reference proper&rsquo; means signals that are under the
voluntary control of agents, and are used to refer to objects in the
environment. Such signals may indicate a capacity to refer that is
shared with humans, and potentially evidence for word-like signals in
animal communication.</p>

<p>
In the discussion that follows we use examples not only of cases where
animal signals seem to refer, but also cases where animal signals seem
to be used with stable meanings comparable to the words of a natural
language. This approach mirrors one found in the animal communication
literature, where cases of potential reference have been subsumed into
broader debates about whether animals can know the meanings of words.
If animals do not know the meanings of words, then they cannot use
them to refer. However, whether animals understand word meanings will
depend on what this knowledge of meaning entails, and as the following
section will make clear, this is not a matter of consensus.</p>

<h4 id="ArgForAniKnoMea">2.2.1 Arguments for animal knowledge of meaning</h4>

<p>
Intuitively compelling cases of animal reference can be found in both
word-like features of the communicative repertoires of wild animals,
and in the communicative systems of animals reared in human
environments. With respect to the former, wild populations of great
apes use their gestures with stable semantic properties. The purported
meanings of these gestures have been studied and compiled (e.g.,
Hobaiter &amp; Byrne 2014). Since great ape gestures are
paradigmatically used to talk about actions (e.g., to make utterances
like &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Groom me!&rdquo;), these gestures
figure less in debates about reference, because the term
&lsquo;reference&rsquo; is used by comparative psychologists only
where signs are noun-like. (In contrast, philosophers use the term
with a broader and more technical scope&mdash;as when describing the
reference of a proposition in terms of its truth value.) Nonetheless,
these gestures are also candidates for having meanings in the same
manner as words.</p>

<p>
Potential cases of knowledge of meaning have also been identified in
animals who interact regularly with humans, including great apes
trained to use and understand either sign-language (Fouts &amp; Fouts
1993), or specially adapted lexigrams (Savage-Rumbaugh, Shanker, et
al. 1998); a parrot, Alex, who has demonstrated a remarkable aptitude
for using and understanding human words (Pepperberg 1981); and a dog,
Rico, who can seemingly understand hundreds of human words, including
object names (Kaminski, Call, &amp; Fischer 2004).</p>

<p>
Enculturated animals are raised in human-like environments and given
species-atypical exposure to human interaction (see Berio &amp; Moore
2023, for discussion). While enculturation projects have met with
mixed success (contrast Terrace 2019 with Fouts &amp; Fouts 1993),
some have presented highly impressive findings of the communicative
development of great apes (e.g., Savage-Rumbaugh 1986;
Savage-Rumbaugh, Shanker, &amp; Taylor 1998). For example, the bonobo
Kanzi was raised in an environment where he interacted daily with
human researchers led by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh. While Kanzi was not
taught to use lexigrams (symbols on a keyboard that when pressed play
the sounds of words), he learned to do so at a young age by watching
his human caregivers&rsquo; unsuccessful attempts to teach his
adoptive mother. He can reportedly understand a couple of thousand
words of English (although some counting methods report lower numbers
(Call 2011), and he communicates fluently using a lexigram board that
contains around 450 signs, using perhaps 30&ndash;40 of these daily in
the production of his own utterances (Savage-Rumbaugh 1986). These
cases raise the questions of whether animals can understand the
meanings of words; and what this understanding consists in.</p>

<h4 id="ArgAgaAniKnoMea">2.2.1 Arguments against animal knowledge of meaning</h4>

<p>
One possible answer to the question &ldquo;Do animals know the
meanings of words?&rdquo; is given by Berwick and Chomsky (2016). On
their view, animals cannot understand word meanings, because what
constitutes meaning is the mapping of a sign to a concept. They argue
that since chimpanzees lack a human-like conceptual system, they
cannot map signs to concepts in the required way, and so cannot know
the meanings of words. While they don&rsquo;t say much about what they
take concept possession to consist in, they support their argument by
citing an early study by Petitto and colleagues (2005), which
discusses Nim, a chimpanzee who was raised by Terrace and colleagues
in a human environment, where he was taught to use American Sign
Language. Petitto argues that although Nim could produce the gestures
he was trained to use:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Nim didn&rsquo;t actually learn about words, and didn&rsquo;t even
have the human concept for &ldquo;apple&rdquo;. For Nim, an
&ldquo;apple&rdquo; was the object associated with the knife in the
draw that cut the apple, the place that apples were found, and so
on[.] (Berwick &amp; Chomsky 2016: 146)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
They also cite approvingly the work of Petitto (Petitto 2005:
85&ndash;87), who argues that Nim&rsquo;s patterns of word-use show
that &ldquo;chimps do not really have names for things at all &hellip;
only a hodge-podge of loose associations&rdquo; (ibid.). If Nim had no
concept of apple, then he could not know the meaning of the gesture
&lsquo;apple&rsquo;, since this requires a form-concept mapping.</p>

<p>
Berwick and Chomsky&rsquo;s (2016) argument deserves a more
substantial engagement than can be attempted here. Still, in response
to it, two points are worth making. First, some philosophers have
argued that animals do have conceptual knowledge (Glock 2000;
Finkelstein 2007), even if the contents of their concepts differ from
our own. If this is right, an account of knowledge of meaning grounded
in concept possession might plausibly be defended for animal
communicators. Second, the conclusion that Nim&rsquo;s gestures show
his concepts to be un-human-like seems to be motivated at least in
part by his producing gestures in seemingly inappropriate
contexts&mdash;for example, by gesturing &lsquo;apple&rsquo; in the
presence of a knife. This raises questions about how behaviours and
concepts should be connected. Even if there were a consensus view of
what concept possession consists in (and there is not), an account of
the kinds of gestural behaviour that would constitute evidence of the
concept possession needed for knowledge of meaning is independent of
this. Berwick and Chomsky don&rsquo;t consider what patterns of
sign-use would indicate knowledge of meaning, but without an answer to
this question, it&rsquo;s unclear what Nim&rsquo;s verbal behaviour
shows.</p>

<p>
While the view that knowledge of meaning consists of knowing a
word-concept mapping is popular among cognitive scientists (e.g.,
Bloom 2000), it is less central to philosophical accounts of
meaning&mdash;not least because questions about the relationship
between language-use and concept possession can seem prohibitively
difficult to answer. Some philosophers of language have instead tended
to equate knowledge of meaning with knowing how to use words to pursue
certain kinds of communicative goals, and understanding others&rsquo;
uses of words. For example, Wittgenstein famously held that &ldquo;for
a large class of cases &hellip; the meaning of a word is its use in
the language&rdquo; (1953: 43). This has often been taken to entail
that knowing the meaning of a word consists in knowing how to use
it&mdash;something that could seemingly be granted to animals who know
how to use words to fulfil their communicative goals. On such an
account, there may be no reason to deny knowledge of meaning to at
least some animals. For example, Nim&rsquo;s voluntarily gesturing a
sign for &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; when looking at a knife used to cut
apples need not be evidence of a confused concept of apple, so much as
a case of a hungry chimpanzee requesting an object in its absence
(&ldquo;I want an apple!&rdquo;). (This ability for absent reference
was, until recently, taken to be uniquely human&mdash;although it has
now been identified in chimpanzees (Lyn et al. 2014; Bohn, Call, &amp;
Tomasello 2015).)</p>

<p>
A similar explanation of knowledge of meaning also can be identified
in the work of Grice (1989), who argued that for a word to have a
&lsquo;standing&rsquo; (i.e., conventional) meaning is for
communicators to use that word to express certain kinds of
communicative intentions. Currently influential approaches to
identifying the meanings of great ape gestures draw influence from
Gricean and Wittgensteinian approaches, by identifying their meanings
of great ape gestures with the goals with which these gestures are
produced. In turn, the content of the communicative goal is inferred
from the agent&rsquo;s apparent satisfaction with the results of their
gesturing (see Hobaiter &amp; Byrne 2014). While legitimate questions
arise about whether animals can be credited with the ability to
express communicative intentions (see
 <a href="#GriPra">&sect;4.2</a>),
 if they can, it&rsquo;s not clear what further reasons one might have
for denying them knowledge of meaning&mdash;even if their utterances
indicate no evidence of syntax, phonology, morphology, or myriad other
features of human language (<em>contra</em> Petitto 2005).</p>

<p>
Perhaps some would object that specifying knowledge of meaning without
reference to concept possession is also problematic. At least
implicitly, Terrace (2019), director of the Nim project, raises such a
concern. He worries that agents who lack concepts could nonetheless
use words to manipulate others, without understanding them, in the
same way that one might manipulate the keys on a keyboard to guide a
character in a computer game. Such concerns motivate him to deny that
Nim knew the meanings of words. He argues that manipulation is
particularly likely in the kinds of requesting behaviour in which
chimpanzees engage, because words are here very closely tied to
behaviour (like the receipt of an object). This leads to a pattern in
which creatures can uncomprehendingly repeat words, without knowing
their meanings, because they are rewarded for doing so. He argues that
an ability to use words to share information about or interest in
something would be better evidence of knowledge of meaning, since in
such cases there is no direct reward for uttering. This raises another
problem, though. For all that we might like such evidence, chimpanzees
seem to be largely unmotivated to communicate solely to share
information (see
 <a href="#CooAniCom">&sect;5</a>).
 This doesn&rsquo;t entail they lack knowledge of word meaning though.
It shows only that our basis for attributing to them knowledge of
meaning lacks one compelling kind of evidence.</p>

<p>
Our view is that the arguments for denying knowledge of word meanings
to non-human great apes are unpersuasive. Nonetheless, we don&rsquo;t
propose to settle the question of whether animals know the meanings of
words here. Rather, we acknowledge that this area of research would
benefit from further philosophical attention.</p>

<h2 id="Syn">3. Syntax</h2>

<h3 id="WhaSyn">3.1 What is syntax?</h3>

<p>
In the literature on human communication, syntax refers to the ability
to combine meaningful semantic units (like words) into larger,
meaningful strings with a hierarchical structure (like sentences).
This capacity is critical to human communication, and it underpins
much of its characteristic expressive power. It&rsquo;s thanks to our
capacity to combine words into sentences that we can express an
unimaginably large number of different thoughts using a limited set of
linguistic elements.</p>

<p>
The prevailing view in the literature on language evolution holds that
the capacity for syntax is uniquely human. Berwick &amp; Chomsky
(2016), for example, argue that syntax distinguishes our minds from
the minds of animals. On their view, syntax (which they sometimes call
&lsquo;language&rsquo;) is not specifically a feature of
communication, but of thought. They argue that, unlike animal minds,
human minds possess concepts (although what they mean by
&lsquo;concepts&rsquo; is not entirely clear). These concepts are said
to be bound together using syntactic rules, to create hierarchically
organised thoughts. Thoughts can then be &lsquo;externalised&rsquo;
via the &lsquo;sensorimotor interface&rsquo; (the system for producing
and understanding speech), for the purposes of communication.
Nonetheless, on their view syntax is a feature of thought, which
underwent natural selection for its role in thought and planning,
independently of any communicative function.</p>

<p>
According to Berwick and Chomsky (2016), human syntax is made possible
by a computational ability, Merge, which combines two objects (a, b)
to generate a structure {a, b}. Merge incorporates two operations: it
combines elements, and imposes a hierarchical structure on them, which
in turn constrains the interpretation of the string. To say that Merge
imposes hierarchical structure means that its outputs are
rule-governed compositions in which units modify some units but not
others. For example, in a phrase like &lsquo;very old house&rsquo;,
&lsquo;very&rsquo; modifies &lsquo;old&rsquo; but not
&lsquo;house&rsquo;: [[very old] house]. A string of units is
hierarchical, in other words, if some units within that string are
grouped together with some other units, to form a larger unit within
the string&mdash;for example, when words are bound into noun phrases,
which can be combined with verbs to make sentences. Hierarchical
structure is often contrasted with linear order, since the binding of
hierarchical elements need not correspond to the order in which they
occur in a sequence (see
 <a href="#ComSynComSigAni">&sect;3.3</a>
 for discussion).</p>

<p>
The outputs of Merge are also taken to be in principle unbounded,
which means that there is no principled limit to the number of
combinations that can be produced. There may be practical limits on
the complexity of the hierarchical structures agents can represent,
because of limitations on their working memory or attention. However,
these are considered to be failures of <em>performance</em>, and not a
reflection on the underlying combinatorial <em>competence</em>, which
is unbound in its capacity to combine elements (Chomsky 1980).</p>

<h3 id="ProSynComSigAni">3.2 The production of syntactically complex signals by animals</h3>

<p>
The literature on animal communication identifies three different
types of combinations in wild animal communication systems:
&lsquo;phonological syntax&rsquo;, &lsquo;combinatorial syntax&rsquo;
and &lsquo;compositional syntax&rsquo; (Hurford 2012).</p>

<p>
Phonological syntax is a rule-based combination of units without
meaning. For instance, studies have shown that Bengalese finches and
Nightingales exhibit specific patterns in the arrangement of their
song elements, although these elements do not seem to possess semantic
information (Berwick, Okanoya, et al. 2011).</p>

<p>
Combinatorial syntax is a combination of meaningful units where the
meaning of the whole is not a function of the meanings of its parts.
An example of combinatorial syntax in animals is putty-nosed
monkeys&rsquo; &lsquo;pyow-hack&rsquo; sequences (Arnold &amp;
Zuberb&uuml;hler 2012). Putty-nosed monkeys use pyows as terrestrial
alarm calls and hacks as eagle alarm calls. When they are used in
sequence they elicit group travel. Since group travel seems to be
unrelated to the individual meanings of hacks and pyows, pyow-hack
messages seem not to be constructed using the semantic features of
these constituent calls. Rather, it seems like the putty-nosed monkeys
have a limited call repertoire and have found a way to combine two
calls from that limited repertoire to convey a third, unrelated
message.</p>

<p>
Compositional syntax is a combination of meaningful units where the
meaning of the whole depends on the meanings of its parts
and&mdash;according to classical views of syntax&mdash;the way the
parts are syntactically combined. It is compositional syntax that
characterises the sentences of natural languages, and evidence of
which in animals would best demonstrate the similarity of animal and
human forms of communication.</p>

<p>
Suzuki and colleagues argue that they have found evidence of such
abilities in Japanese tits, whose &lsquo;ABC-D&rsquo; calls are
thought to meet the criteria for compositional syntax (Suzuki,
Wheatcroft, &amp; Griesser 2018). In Japanese tits, &lsquo;ABC&rsquo;
calls are general alert calls, with a meaning akin to [/threat!/].
&lsquo;D&rsquo; calls serve to recruit group members (e.g., [/come
here!/]). &lsquo;ABC-D&rsquo; calls, together, form mobbing sequences:
these sequences are used by Japanese tits to recruit conspecifics to
mob a stationary predator, and are responded to by conspecifics by
gradually approaching the sender and scanning the surrounding
environment. Based on this evidence, Suzuki and colleagues conclude
that the compound meaning of &lsquo;ABC-D&rsquo; calls is directly
connected to the meanings of its parts, being something akin to
&lsquo;ABC-D&rsquo; = [/threat!/ + /come here!/]. Moreover, they
consider the fact that Japanese tits do not respond to reversed,
artificial &lsquo;D-ABC&rsquo; sequences as evidence that they are
sensitive to the order of the calls, and that the calls have a
hierarchical structure.</p>

<p>
In terms of understanding the evolution of human syntax, compositional
syntax is thought to be the most relevant form of animal combination.
However, a debate exists in the literature about the similarity of
putative cases in animals and humans. Proponents of
&lsquo;scoffer&rsquo; accounts, such as Bolhuis et al. (2018),
downplay the significance of seemingly compositional syntax in
animals, arguing that these cases are qualitatively distinct from
human syntax. Against Bolhuis and colleagues, Townsend, Engesser, et
al. (2018) argue that animal compositional combinations are the
evolutionary precursors of human syntax.</p>

<p>
This disagreement is motivated by different views of what is essential
to syntax. Bolhuis et al. (2018) count hierarchy and unbounded
generativity as essential features of human syntax, and argue that
there is no evidence of these features in animal combinations. They
claim that animal combinations lack internal structure (i.e., they are
nothing more than just &lsquo;summations&rsquo; of individual
meanings), and that while human syntax is unbounded in its nature,
animal signals are fixed and limited in their combinatorial
possibilities. That&rsquo;s because, while sentences of natural
languages can be bound indefinitely (for example, by conjoining any
number of sentences with &lsquo;and&rsquo;), there is very little
evidence of long strings of signals in the animal kingdom (i.e., there
is no evidence of boundless Merge). For example, more sober analyses
of the utterances produced by enculturated chimpanzees suggest that
for the most part they produce strings of only two or three gestures
or symbols (Rivas 2005). Other data suggest that there is no
combinatorial use of gestures by wild chimpanzees (Hobaiter &amp;
Byrne 2011). However, against Bolhuis and colleagues, we would point
out that while data show limited evidence of complex combinatoriality
in great apes, this is not a valid basis from which to conclude that
human communication alone is characterised by boundless
combinatoriality. That&rsquo;s because such a claim turns on an
illegitimate comparison of performance and competence (Chomsky 1980).
That is, it turns on a comparison of what humans can do in principle
(but not in practice) with what animals can do in practice. This is
not a comparison of like with like. A more cautious conclusion would
hold just that there is no evidence of hierarchical syntax or complex
combinatoriality (that is, long and varied strings of signs) in
non-human species.</p>

<p>
Against such a sceptical view, Townsend, Engesser, and colleagues
(2018) have argued that there is more continuity between
compositionality in animals and human syntax than has often been
assumed. However, this account is based on a weaker understanding of
what human syntax requires. On this view, syntactic structures can
include combinations of semantic elements in which the meanings of the
whole are determined by the meanings of the parts, but where the parts
need not be hierarchically structured. The capacity for combining
units also need not be unbounded to qualify as syntactic. According to
Townsend and colleagues, the absence of hierarchy and generativity in
animal combinations does not pose a significant challenge for
continuity claims, because human language also contains examples of
non-hierarchical and non-generative structures which, they claim, are
nonetheless intuitively syntactic. Townsend et al. illustrate their
claim by providing examples of phrases like &lsquo;duck and
cover&rsquo;, which they take to be non-hierarchical, and &lsquo;gimme
a break&rsquo;, which they take to be non-generative, since it is
ordinarily not embedded into longer syntactic strings. Using these
criteria, Townsend et al. argue that there is evidence of syntax in
Pied babblers (Engesser, Ridley, &amp;, Townsend 2016), Japanese tits
(Suzuki, Wheatcroft, &amp; Griesser 2018), and potentially in
chimpanzees (Leroux et al. 2023). However, whether one is satisfied by
this argument will depend on whether or not one is willing to accept
the accompanying arguments for lowering the threshold of what counts
as evidence of syntax.</p>

<p>
Even if one is willing to accept a lower threshold for evidence of
syntax, Schlenker, Coye, and colleagues (2023; see also Schlenker,
Chemla, et al. 2016) argue that many purported cases of compositional
syntax in animals can be given deflationary interpretations. For
example, they argue that call sequences like the ABC-D calls found in
Japanese tits (Suzuki, Wheatcroft, &amp; Griesser 2018) can be viewed
as separate, successive utterances, rather than as complex syntactic
units. Schlenker and colleagues (Schlenker, Coye, et al. 2023) refer
to such cases as possessing only &ldquo;trivial
compositionality&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In cases of trivial compositionality, Schlenker and colleagues argue
that the meaning of animal sequences can be explained not by appeal to
syntactic rules, but by instead appealing to pragmatic mechanisms of
competition among signals&mdash;which they characterise in terms of
Informativity and Urgency principles. The Informativity principle
establishes that more informative utterances should be preferred over
less informative utterances (Schlenker, Chemla, et al. 2016: 19). The
Urgency principle is a variant of the Informativity principle and</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
mandates that calls that provide information about the nature/location
of a threat &hellip; must come before calls that don&rsquo;t.
(Schlenker, Chemla, et al. 2016: 33)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Schlenker, Chemla, et al. (2016: 37), the Urgency
principle explains, for example, why a sequence of pyows followed by a
small number of hacks (i.e., pyow-hack sequences) signals group
movement in putty-nosed monkeys. Given that, if there was an eagle,
hacks would have come first in the sequence, the fact that they
don&rsquo;t suggests that the non-ground movement signalled by the
sequence is non-threat related and thus, most likely, group movement.
Bar-On has recently criticised some aspects of this proposal (Bar-On
forthcoming).</p>

<h3 id="ComSynComSigAni">3.3 The comprehension of syntactically complex signals by animals</h3>

<p>
If evidence of syntactic complexity in wild animals is underwhelming,
findings drawn from the study of enculturated great apes may prove to
be more compelling. As previously discussed (see
 <a href="#DoAniKnoMeaWor">&sect;2.2</a>),
 studies of the communicative abilities of enculturated chimpanzees
and bonobos have consistently found that they produce strings of
signs; and are capable of understanding longer strings of human
speech. While studies of utterance production by Kanzi and others show
an ability to produce strings of two or three signs that are seemingly
more complex than anything seen in wild apes, they present no evidence
of hierarchical syntax (Berio &amp; Moore 2023). However, although
Kanzi does not produce grammatically structured utterances, he can
track relatively subtle grammatical differences. In a detailed study
of Kanzi&rsquo;s ability to understand syntactic complexity,
Savage-Rumbaugh, Murphy, and colleagues (1993) report that in testing
he responded differentially to utterances that were semantically
similar but syntactically different (see Truswell 2017, for
discussion). This includes utterances like:</p>

<ol>

<li>Put the tomato in the oil.</li>

<li>Put some oil in the tomato.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In cases like the former, Kanzi is reported to have put the tomato in
the oil as requested; and in the latter, to have poured oil into a
bowl with the tomato. Truswell has recently argued that these data
suggest that Kanzi tracks not only the semantic properties of
utterances, but also syntax-relevant properties like linear order
(Truswell 2017). However, he also shows that Kanzi struggles with some
simple, non-linear grammatical forms, where word order is not
sufficient to generate correct interpretations of the sentence. For
example, when asked to &lsquo;Fetch the tomato and the oil&rsquo;,
Kanzi typically brings only one or the other. Truswell argues that
this shows that Kanzi is unable to understand hierarchical syntactic
relations like binding two nouns to the same verb (2017). That is, he
cannot represent the internal structure of sentences, where this
differs from the order of words in those sentences. Rather, he just
decodes words in the order they are presented.</p>

<p>
This finding suggests that humans have a capacity for hierarchical
syntax that may not be possessed by even enculturated great apes. It
also raises the question of whether there is evidence of any ability
to master non-linear grammars in any animal species. In this context
an early study on captive bottlenose dolphins (Herman, Richards, &amp;
Wolz 1984) provides stronger evidence for hierarchical processing. In
this study, two bottlenose dolphins were instructed in an artificial
language to perform specific actions in relation to named objects and
modifiers. While one dolphin was trained in the use of a linear
grammar (&lsquo;<em>A</em> take to <em>B</em>&rsquo;), the other was
trained to use a non-linear grammar (e.g., &lsquo;to <em>B</em>,
<em>A</em> take&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<em>A</em> take to
<em>B</em>&rsquo;). Since the dolphin was able to master these
constructions, albeit imperfectly, it may be that dolphins are not
limited to tracking linear order. However, since this is a single
study of one animal, it is possible to draw only limited conclusions
about what it shows. This is especially so since Herman&rsquo;s study
does not report in full the sentences on which dolphins were tested,
making a more detailed analysis of its performance impossible.</p>

<p>
Thus, for now, it can be concluded only that there is no real evidence
of any ability for hierarchical syntax in the animal kingdom, either
in the production or in the comprehension of utterances. More studies
will be needed before strong conclusions can be drawn. Nonetheless, in
recent years a clear set of theoretical frameworks have emerged within
which putative cases of syntactic complexity can be studied and
evaluated. Methods for operationalising these theoretical insights,
and testing hypotheses empirically, are still being developed.</p>

<h2 id="Pra">4. Pragmatics</h2>

<p>
The study of pragmatics relates to the use and interpretation of
meaningful signs. However, what exactly this is taken to mean is
controversial.</p>

<h3 id="CarPra">4.1 Carnapian pragmatics</h3>

<p>
As noted in the discussion of functional reference (see
 <a href="#FunRef">&sect;2.1</a>),
 animal vocal signals have often been thought non-voluntarily
produced, and so crucially unlike language-use (Tomasello 2008;
Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012). Consequently, language evolution
researchers have sometimes maintained that these signals are
uninteresting from the perspective of language evolution research.
Others have argued that we can nonetheless find an analogue of some
features of language in the context-dependent interpretation of
signals, whether or not these are voluntarily produced (Wheeler &amp;
Fischer 2012). Such cases might be treated as instances of pragmatic
interpretation. Since many (e.g., Tomasello 2008; Scott-Phillips 2017;
Moore 2017a) have hypothesised that pragmatics plays a foundational
role in the evolution of language, studying the pragmatic features of
animal communication might shed light not only upon interactions
between animals, but language origins too. This view has been defended
not only by Wheeler &amp; Fischer (2012), but by Scarantino (2017;
Scarantino &amp; Clay 2015).</p>

<p>
Scarantino&rsquo;s &lsquo;Theory of Affective Pragmatics&rsquo;
&ldquo;focuses on what emotional expressions mean in a context&rdquo;
(Scarantino 2017: 166; see also Scarantino, Hareli, &amp; Hess 2022),
and the ways in which emotional expressions direct others&rsquo;
behaviours, allowing for analogues of descriptive, commissive,
imperative and expressive speech acts. He argues that in the
non-verbal communication of humans and animals, emotional expressions
play a richer proto-linguistic role than previously acknowledged:
&ldquo;much of what we can do with language we can also do with
nonverbal emotional expressions&rdquo; (2017: 165). On his view, an
angry frown in the appropriate context can amount to describing a
target behaviour as unacceptable, demanding that the behaviour stop,
and as expressing disappointment, among other things. By showing how
emotional expressions can perform the function of illocutionary force
(for example, by showing whether an utterance conveys a request or an
order), Scarantino proposes to contribute to an explanation of
language evolution, by showing how key elements of speech act theory
are already present in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>
Scarantino&rsquo;s approach emphasises studying the contextual
interpretation of animal signals for understanding the evolution of
language. It is part of a body of pragmatics-influenced work on
language evolution that has been labelled &lsquo;Carnapian
pragmatics&rsquo;, after the philosopher Rudolf Carnap. As Bar-On and
Moore define it, Carnapian pragmatics</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is the study of the variation (and derivation) of the significance of
sentence (or signal) types with the context of production. (Bar-On
&amp; Moore 2017: 296)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Proponents of Carnapian pragmatics (e.g., Seyfarth &amp; Cheney 2003;
Fitch 2010; Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012; Arnold &amp; Zuberb&uuml;hler
2013; Scarantino &amp; Clay 2015; Seyfarth &amp; Cheney 2017) argue
that the informational contents of animal signals are
context-dependent, in the same manner as linguistic terms like
indexicals. For example, putty-nosed monkeys produce eagle alarm calls
(&lsquo;hacks&rsquo;) in the presence of eagles, but they also produce
these calls in non-predatory situations, such as in response to
falling trees and baboon fights (Arnold &amp; Zuberb&uuml;hler 2013).
When eagle calls are given in these non-predatory contexts,
putty-nosed monkeys do not respond by enacting characteristic flee
behaviours (as they would for eagles), suggesting that the
informational contents of eagle calls are different in different
contexts, and that receivers integrate contextual information in
interpreting the calls. Scarantino and Clay (2015) identify four main
categories of the kinds of contextual clues they think likely
influence the interpretation of animal communication:</p>

<ol>

<li>identity cues, which contain information about the identity of the
signaller (e.g., status, age, kinship, reliability);</li>

<li>behavioural cues, which contain information about the activity of
the signaller during signal production (e.g., gaze and body
orientation);</li>

<li>environmental cues, which contain information about events
occurring in the environment; and</li>

<li>sequence-placement cues, which contain information about the
signal sequence (e.g., other signals produced in adjacent periods of
time).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The concept of information at work in Carnapian pragmatics corresponds
to a loose version of Grice&rsquo;s notion of natural meaning (Grice
1957; Scarantino 2015; see
 <a href="#FunRef">&sect;2.1</a>).
 It is the kind of meaning that allows us to make inferences about
some parts of the world based on our perception of other parts. On
Scarantino&rsquo;s account, identity cues (like the pitch of a
caller&rsquo;s voice) might (naturally) mean that a call is being
given by one member of a group, rather than others; and contextually
salient behavioural cues, like the caller&rsquo;s line of sight at the
time of the call, naturally indicate that the call was produced in
response to some features of the environment, rather than others.</p>

<p>
Different versions of Carnapian pragmatics make different claims about
the role of information in guiding the contextually variant responses
of the animals who perceive and interpret signs. Information can be
used either as a proximate or as an ultimate explanatory construct
(Kalkman 2017; Mayr 1961). As a proximate explanatory construct,
information is something that recipients represent on a psychological
level, explaining how recipients respond to communicative signals. As
an ultimate explanatory construct, information accounts for the
evolution of recipients&rsquo; responses, without necessarily being
psychologically represented by them. In other words, when information
plays an ultimate explanatory role, the fact that signals correlate
with, i.e., carry information about, determinate states of affairs
explains why determinate responses have been selected. Whereas
according to Wheeler and Fischer (Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012) animals
respond to communicative signals by mentally representing the
signals&rsquo; informational contents, Scarantino thinks the
information extracted is not necessarily psychologically represented
by animals (Scarantino 2013, 2017; Scarantino &amp; Clay 2015).</p>

<p>
There are theoretical benefits of a Carnapian pragmatic approach to
animal communication and language evolution. It can explain
communicative interactions between animal communicators, and
identifies continuities between animal and human communication even
where the mechanisms of signal production in animals and humans
differ. Some scholars have nonetheless criticised the relevance of
Carnapian pragmatics to language evolution research. According to
Bar-On and Moore (2017; Bar-On 2021; Moore 2017d), Carnapian
pragmatics fails to isolate the right point of continuity with
language to constitute a foundation for language evolution research.
They argue that if we accept that language develops on the back of a
capacity to act with and interpret intentionally communicative
behaviour, it is unclear how we can hope to shed light on its
evolution by focusing on a notion of meaning&mdash;natural
meaning&mdash;the interpretation of which may implicate quite
difference psychological processes from those needed for the
interpretation of communicative goals. Bar-On (2021) argues that
Carnapian pragmatics sets the explanatory bar too low.
Context-dependent interpretation, she argues, marks continuity between
animal and human communication, but this continuity &ldquo;seems
hardly sufficient by itself to illuminate the origins of distinctively
human communication&rdquo; (Bar-On 2021: 4), since the sense in which
animals are said to extract information from communicative signals is
the same in which a person extracts information about fire from
(non-communicative) signs of smoke. In that case, she argues, work on
Carnapian pragmatics in animal communication cannot tell us much about
the evolution of language&mdash;at least if we think that language
evolution required the interpretation of specifically communicative
acts.</p>

<h3 id="GriPra">4.2 Gricean pragmatics</h3>

<p>
Some authors have adopted a &lsquo;Gricean&rsquo; approach to
describing the psychological states that support at least some kinds
of (voluntary) animal communication (G&oacute;mez 1994; Brinck 2004;
Moore 2017a). These approaches take their name from the philosopher
Paul Grice, whose work attempted to specify necessary and sufficient
conditions for an agent to act with communicative intent (in his
words, actions possessed of non-natural meaning, or
&lsquo;meaning<sup>NN</sup>&rsquo;). While Grice&rsquo;s work has been
highly influential in the study of human communication, it has often
been considered ill-suited to the characterisation of the
communication of animals, because the mental states Grice identified
as characteristic of communication are thought to implicate
psychological states that cannot plausibly be attributed to non-human
minds. In Grice&rsquo;s own words, communicative intentions are
&ldquo;plainly too sophisticated a state to be found in a
language-destitute creature&rdquo; (1986: 85).</p>

<p>
The authors who argue that animals may be Gricean communicators accept
Grice&rsquo;s characterisation of communicative intentions, but reject
his conclusion that communicative intentions cannot be attributed to
animals (G&oacute;mez 1994; Moore 2016). This is because they deny
that Grice&rsquo;s characterisation of the cognitive prerequisites of
meaning<sup>NN</sup> are entailed by his analysis of the intentional
character of communication. This idea is controversial.</p>

<p>
On Grice&rsquo;s account, what distinguishes actions possessed of
meaning<sup>NN</sup> from other kinds of actions is the intentions
with which they are performed. Variations of his analysis of his
account have been widely, if not universally, accepted (see Neale
1992; Sperber &amp; Wilson 1995; Tomasello 2008; Scott-Phillips 2015).
The following characterisation is derived from Neale&rsquo;s (1992)
modification of Grice&rsquo;s (1957) account.</p>

<p>
A speaker <em>S</em> acts with communicative intent if and only if she
performs an utterance (<em>x</em>) for an interlocutor <em>H</em>
intending:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="intend1">(1)</dt>
<dd><em>H</em> to produce a particular response <em>r</em>, and</dd>
<dt id="intend2">(2)</dt>
<dd><em>H</em> to recognise that <em>S</em> intends (1),</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and additionally</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="intend3">(3)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> has no further intention that <em>H</em> be deceived
about (1) and (2).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Together clauses (1), (2) and (3) are necessary and sufficient for
acting with communicative intent. On this formulation, (1) specifies
the goal that a communicator, <em>S</em>, aims to achieve through her
utterance of <em>x</em>. Usually this is specified as either (i) an
intention to produce a belief in <em>H</em>, or (ii) to have them
perform some action <em>&alpha;</em> (although there may be other
options [Moore 2017a]). For example, if I leave my empty wine glass on
the table where you can see it, with the goal that you see and refill
it, my intention (1) would be to have you refill my glass. While the
first clause intention is necessary for an action to be communicative,
Grice argued that it is not sufficient. That&rsquo;s because many
intuitively non-communicative actions can also be performed with
intentions like (1). For example, I might surreptitiously leave my
empty glass in view in the hope that you&rsquo;ll see it, but without
drawing attention to this for fear of seeming rude. This is consistent
with (1), but Grice argued that such cases are intuitively not
communicative.</p>

<p>
For Grice, what truly distinguishes communicative acts from many other
types of intentional act is their overtness. Successful communication
is a public act: we know when someone is communicating with us. This
is not the case in the example of me discreetly moving my glass, since
here my host might be entirely unaware of my surreptitious goal. The
openness of communication is captured by the addition of
 <a href="#intend2">(2)</a>.
 I might fulfil (2) not only by leaving my glass where you can see it,
but by deliberately drawing your attention to my glass. Here I not
only have an intention like
 <a href="#intend1">(1)</a>,
 but I also intend that my interlocutor recognise that I have this
intention. The addition of clause (2) rules out cases where I try to
have you refill my glass surreptitiously, and thereby captures the
openness of communication.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#intend3">Clause (3)</a>
 blocks certain cases (Neale 1992) that many commentators have thought
constitute counterexamples to Grice&rsquo;s analysis. Typically they
turn on cases where a speaker has a higher order intention that
undermines their possession of
 <a href="#intend1">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#intend2">(2)</a>,
 and so threatens the sufficiency of (1) and (2) for an account of
communicative intentions. While many have thought this justifies the
insertion of a blocking clause like (3), it need not be entertained by
speakers (or hearers) to do its work, and so doesn&rsquo;t add any
complexity to the psychological states involved in Gricean
communication.</p>

<h4 id="RehGriAcc">4.2.1 Rehabilitating the Gricean account</h4>

<p>
A myriad of objections have been raised to the possibility that
non-humans could be Gricean communicators. The most common concern is
that Gricean communication is socio-cognitively demanding, because
Gricean communication requires higher order metarepresentations of
others&rsquo; mental states. For example, in the case of an utterance
that is produced to change others&rsquo; beliefs, Grice&rsquo;s
analysis seems to require entertaining a fourth order
metarepresentation like (i) <em>S</em> intends that (ii) <em>H</em>
believe that (iii) <em>S</em> intends that (iv) <em>H</em> believe
that <em>p</em> (Dennett 1983; see also Planer 2017; Scott-Phillips
2015; Sperber 2000; Sterelny 2017; Thompson 2014; and G&oacute;mez
1994; Brinck 2004; and Moore 2017a, for criticism of this view). Given
that even twelve-year-old children struggle to understand fourth order
meta-representations (Liddle &amp; Nettle 2006), and since there is
evidence of first order belief understanding in only a few animal
species (Krupenye et al. 2016), these requirements seem to preclude
the possibility of Gricean communicators in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>
Further concerns have also been raised, including that Gricean
communication requires syntactically complex propositional thought
(Bar-On 2013); that Gricean communication requires uniquely human
forms of joint action (Tomasello 2008; Jankovic 2014; see Moore 2018a;
see also
 <a href="#ComForJoiAct">&sect;5.2</a>);
 and that it requires a motivation to share information about mental
states that seems to be missing from the animal kingdom (Bar-On 2013;
Tomasello 2008; Scott-Phillips 2015; Scott-Phillips &amp; Heintz 2023;
see Moore 2017c for discussion; see also
 <a href="#CooAniCom">&sect;5</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Proponents of the view that animals can be Gricean communicators argue
for the claim not by attributing rich metarepresentational and
cooperative abilities to animals, but by arguing against the
assumption that Gricean communication is socio-cognitively difficult.
For example, several proponents of the Gricean view have argued that
Grice&rsquo;s
 <a href="#intend2">clause (2)</a>
 can be fulfilled by the role of eye contact in communicative
interaction, and that consequently subjects need not be capable of
higher order metarepresentations to be able to act and interpret
Gricean intent. They argue that if communicators engage their
interlocutors in mutual eye contact as a means of addressing their
communicative acts to them, as great ape species do (G&oacute;mez
1996), then their first clause intentions (1) will be public in a
manner sufficient for the fulfilment of (2) (Moore 2017a; see also
G&oacute;mez 1994; Brinck 2004). Moore (2017b) additionally argues
that clauses (1) and (2) specify functional features of communicative
acts, and their psychological correlates. For example, it&rsquo;s
because utterances are ordinarily causally inefficacious that they
must be directed to the attention of their intended interlocutors, in
the manner described by (2), so that interlocutors are encouraged to
make inferences about the contents of agents&rsquo; communicative
goals. As a result, he thinks, Gricean forms of communication may be
present in many animal species, even if such creatures can produce and
interpret only a very limited repertoire of Gricean acts.</p>

<p>
Additional attenuations of the complexity of Gricean communication can
also be made. For example, it has been argued there may be Gricean
communicators whose communication consists only of imperative-like
utterances, produced to solicit others to act (Moore 2017b; although
see Scott-Phillips &amp; Heintz 2023 for a contrary view); who engage
in only limited forms of collaborative action, if any (Moore 2018a);
whose utterances are not even propositionally structured (Moore 2021);
and that there may be signature limits on the interpretational
abilities of great ape communicators, despite their being Gricean
communicators (Graham, Rossano &amp; Moore 2024). On this development
of the &lsquo;minimally&rsquo; Gricean view, what is essential is only
that communicative acts are produced with intentions characterised by
 <a href="#intend1">clauses (1), (2) and (3)</a>,
 as described above, and that interpreters are capable of interpreting
such intentions.</p>

<h4 id="ObjMinGriVie">4.2.2 Objections to the &lsquo;minimally&rsquo; Gricean View</h4>

<p>
Many object to even &lsquo;minimally&rsquo; Gricean approaches to
explaining animal communication.</p>

<p>
Planer &amp; Sterelny (2021) have argued that since folk psychology is
a human construct, and not likely to be reflective of cognitive
processes that support human communication, then we ought not to
suppose that folk psychological theories of communication play any
interesting role in explaining our communication. A similar point has
been made by Dennett (2017; see also Azzouni 2013; Planer
forthcoming), who argues that while Grice&rsquo;s characterisation of
communication is broadly right, we ought not to think of the states
Grice described as needing to be represented by communicators. (As an
analogy, consider that someone could catch a falling tennis ball
without being able to represent the mathematical description of its
trajectory.) The latter objection has something in common with Gricean
approaches to animal communication, in that both views argue that
common interpretations of Gricean psychology have been
intellectualised. If Grice&rsquo;s intentions need no longer be
represented by subjects, or need not be represented in the ways often
thought, then it&rsquo;s no longer clear why the cognition of
communicative intentions would be prohibitively difficult. (If agents
need not represent the elements of Gricean intentions, then it becomes
less clear why anyone would consider them too cognitively difficult
for animals to understand. But perhaps humans alone have undergone the
processes of natural selection that would enable us to track the
features of Gricean intentions (Sperber &amp; Wilson 2002; Azzouni
2013, especially p.348).)</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most common objection to applications of a Gricean
framework to animal communication is that the de-intellectualised
reading of Grice is no longer recognisably Gricean. In response, Moore
argues that his account satisfies clauses (1)&ndash;(3), discussed
above, and that this is all that being a Gricean communicator requires
(Moore 2017b). While recognising that animals are limited in
comparison to humans in the complexity of the communicative intentions
they can entertain and interpret, this does not necessitate giving up
the Gricean framework for studying animal interactions. Instead, we
can use the Gricean approach to develop a coherent, continuous
theoretical framework within which to make sense of continuities
between human and animal communication, while also allowing us to
track points of difference. These include differences in the syntactic
complexity of human and animal communication, and the additional
resources that more sophisticated (e.g., human) agents can bring to
pragmatic interpretation&mdash;including, for example, their ability
to reflect on higher order mental states to help them disambiguate the
contents of others&rsquo; utterances.</p>

<h3 id="IntPra">4.3 Intermediary pragmatics</h3>

<p>
Among those who accept that Gricean accounts of communication are
cognitively demanding in ways that makes them unsuitable for
application to animal communication, some have developed alternative
theoretical accounts of intentional communication that can be used to
characterise the interactions of non-humans. In different ways, such
approaches have been developed by Millikan (1984, see also 2017),
Green (2007), Bar-On (2013, 2021, forthcoming), Planer (2017), and
Sterelny (2017), among philosophers, and Warren &amp; Call (2022) and
Scott-Phillips &amp; Heintz (2023) among cognitive scientists. Common
themes in their work include the idea that animal communication can be
voluntary, goal-directed, and that hearers may sometimes make
inferences about speakers&rsquo; goals&mdash;but where this can be
achieved without Gricean demands on metarepresentation and Theory of
Mind. Some of these authors have focused specifically on the
development of accounts of pragmatic interpretation that are motivated
by the rejection of both Gricean and Carnapian approaches. Bar-on
(forthcoming) has called such accounts &lsquo;intermediary
pragmatics&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Despite thinking that Gricean approaches are too cognitively demanding
to support an account of the communicative interactions of
languageless creatures (Bar-On 2013: 345), Bar-On thinks Grice was
right that an account of pragmatic inference in animals must be
&ldquo;psychologically mediated&rdquo; in the manner of human
communication, at least if it is to play a role in explaining language
evolution. Her intermediary pragmatics covers a class of behaviours
that can be voluntarily produced and are psychologically mediated, and
whose interpretation depends upon understanding speakers&rsquo;
intentions, yet where the relevant intentions are not characterised in
Gricean terms (Bar-On forthcoming),</p>

<p>
Bar-On&rsquo;s account is intended to accommodate communicative
interactions between minded agents who lack a theoretical knowledge of
mental states but who can nonetheless engage in processes of mutual
interpretation. Often these types of interactions are made possible by
the presence of expressive behaviours which show agents&rsquo;
psychological states, including facial expressions and bodily
postures, and that make subjects&rsquo; mental states perceptually
available to observers. (see Bar-On 2013). They are said to be
&lsquo;Janus-faced&rsquo;, insofar as they reveal both the states of
the world to which a signaller is attending, and the signaller&rsquo;s
attitude or response towards those states. For example, a chimpanzee
who leaps away from a Gaboon viper can be understood by an observer as
being both directed towards and fearful of that snake. Although
expressive behaviours are not always under intentional control, some
can be brought under voluntary control. Moreover, they may be present
when agents produce voluntary signals, in a manner that facilitates
interpretation of them. In Bar-On&rsquo;s words, this gives expressive
signals</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a proto-pragmatic life of their own qua communicative acts that are
not underwritten by Gricean intentions. (Bar-On 2013: 368)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bar-On emphasises that whether signal interpretation involves
intermediary pragmatic interpretation is independent of how signals
were learned. What&rsquo;s key is that the communicative use of a
signal relies on a receiver&rsquo;s capacity to integrate contextual
information, including arguably an uptake of the caller&rsquo;s
psychological state, as this is shown by their expressive behaviours.
This can also occur even when signals are unlearned and produced
inflexibly.</p>

<p>
Another account of animal communication that falls under the banner of
&lsquo;intermediate pragmatics&rsquo; is Armstrong&rsquo;s theory of
representational coordination (Armstrong 2023), which he uses to model
the &lsquo;minded&rsquo; communicative interactions of primates living
in relatively complex social groups. Like Bar-On, he emphasises that
these forms of animal communication can be psychologically mediated,
without being Gricean.</p>

<p>
On Armstrong&rsquo;s account, &lsquo;minded communication&rsquo; is
characterised in terms of its being flexibly (i.e., voluntarily)
produced, generating responses that are also under the voluntary
control of receivers, and as involving signals that are produced in
order to coordinate the representational mental states of agents.
Senders and receivers act flexibly based on their representations of
their environment, and their expectations about the outcomes of their
actions, including the perceived costs and benefits of their actions.
Armstrong identifies the (biologically inherited) alarm calls of
vervet monkeys as a plausible instance of minded communication. These
calls succeed when senders and receivers both entertain
representations of the same features of the world&mdash;like the
presence of predator.</p>

<h3 id="ConRemPra">4.4 Concluding remarks on pragmatics</h3>

<p>
An outstanding theoretical debate for accounts of animal pragmatics
concerns the extent to which existing views are inconsistent. There is
good reason to think they are not. For example, proponents of Gricean
and intermediate views accept that some calls are not under
intentional control, and that the interpretation of these calls can be
modelled by Carnapian approaches. Their objection, is rather, that
these approaches are not suitable for characterising stages in the
relatively recent evolution of language. Similarly, proponents of
Gricean and intermediary pragmatics agree on many features of animal
communication. It may be that their disagreement is partly
terminological, concerning what is worthy of the name
&lsquo;Gricean&rsquo;. This isn&rsquo;t the only point of difference,
though. For example, Moore places more emphasis than Bar-On on the
ways in which utterances are addressed to others, and the psychology
of this address (see
 <a href="#GriPra">&sect;4.2</a>).
 This may make their views compatible, but suited for describing
slightly different cases&mdash;depending on whether communicative acts
were deliberately addressed to their intended recipients. This would,
potentially, make the transition to Gricean communication in phylogeny
a case of the address of voluntary expressive acts, like those
characterised by Bar-On (2013), being gradually brought under
psychological control.</p>

<p>
One point on which all would agree is that we currently don&rsquo;t
know enough about animal abilities for pragmatic interpretation, in
any species, either with respect to the contextual interpretation of
involuntarily produced signals, or the intention-dependent
interpretation of voluntary signs. Some suggestive cases have been
published, including studies of pointing comprehension in numerous
species (Tomasello, Call, &amp; Gluckman 1997; Hare &amp; Tomasello
2005; Nawroth, Martin, &amp; McElligott 2020). Nonetheless, more
empirical research on contextual variation in the interpretation of
both voluntarily and non-voluntarily produced signs would provide
philosophers with welcome opportunities to theorise about the nature
and limitations of these abilities.</p>

<h2 id="CooAniCom">5. Cooperation in Animal Communication</h2>

<p>
A final issue to consider concerns the extent to which animal
communication is cooperative. The cooperative foundations of human
communication have been thought key to explaining the evolution of
language (Tomasello 2008), and some hold that only for humans do we
have good evidence of voluntary, cooperative
communication&mdash;performed for the purposes of sharing information,
like the location of food. For example, Tomasello writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Communicating information helpfully &hellip; is extremely rare in the
animal kingdom, even in our closest primate relatives[.] (Tomasello
2008: 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Scepticism regarding animal cooperative communication may be motivated
by the idea that prosocial behaviour is biologically maladaptive.
Prosocial behaviour&mdash;that is, behaviour in which one individual
pays a cost to benefit another&mdash;has long been thought to be
potentially difficult to explain within the framework of Darwinian
natural selection (Hamilton 1964; Axelrod &amp; Hamilton 1981; Axelrod
1984). If sharing information facilitates another&rsquo;s survival,
and natural selection is a matter of survival of the fittest, then an
individual who shares information to benefit another may undermine its
own survival prospects. There are several problems with this claim,
though. First, what is meant by cooperative activity must be
explained. Secondly, we ought not overstate the degree of empirical
support for claims about the &lsquo;selfish&rsquo; nature of animal
communication.</p>

<h3 id="SigThe">5.1 Signalling theory</h3>

<p>
A minimal notion of cooperation is at work in signalling theory, a
highly influential approach to communication inspired by David
Lewis&rsquo; work <em>Convention</em> (1969). Versions of this view
are defended by Millikan (1984, 2017), Green (2007), Skyrms (2010),
Planer &amp; Sterelny (2021), and Planer &amp; Godfrey-Smith (2021),
among others. Signalling theory frames the communication of biological
species using the tools of evolutionary theory (Skyrms 2010). It views
communication as a dynamic process of coadaptation between a sender
and a receiver, where senders and receivers mutually shape their
behaviours over time.</p>

<p>
Often presented as an alternative to Gricean approaches (e.g., Planer
&amp; Sterelny 2021), signalling theory makes only modest demands on
agent psychology, and makes no references to speakers&rsquo;
intentions. This makes it suitable for characterising the
communication of many biological species, including cells and
bacteria, whose interactions are unlikely to be well characterised by
intentionalist theories of communication. It is sometimes also adopted
by authors who are sceptical that folk psychological explanations of
behaviour map neatly onto a mechanistic account of the mind (ibid.).
While often used to frame accounts of biologically coevolved pairs of
signals and responses (Tinbergen 1952, Maynard-Smith &amp; Harper
2003), its application is also not restricted to such cases. Signals
may also be designed by processes of cultural evolution (Millikan
1984), copied (Planer &amp; Godfrey-Smith 2021), or even improvised
(Planer &amp; Sterelny 2021), so long as there is some process by
which they are designed and selected. However, to the extent that
signalling theory dispenses with reference to speakers&rsquo;
intentions, it may be unsuitable for characterising signals the
interpretation of which is intention-dependent.</p>

<p>
In the classic set-up devised by Skyrms (2010), senders and receivers
are viewed as asymmetrical agents. The sender can perceive the world,
but is only able to act in ways visible to the receiver. The receiver
can act but cannot perceive the world. In this scenario selective
pressures can lead to the emergence and stabilisation of signalling
systems. Signallers can evolve to produce signs in response to
perceived states of affairs, transmitting information to receivers;
and receivers can evolve to respond to signals, since it is adaptive
for them to learn about states of the world they cannot perceive. The
essence of communication, according to signalling theory, lies in
coordination between the receiver&rsquo;s actions and states of the
world (act-state coordination), including the sender&rsquo;s actions
(act-act coordination) (Planer &amp; Godfrey-Smith 2021). This
coordination is exemplified by the receiver attending and responding
to what the sender perceives, such as the presence of a predator or a
source of food, or what the perceiver is doing. For example, based on
this framework, play signals can be seen as enabling coordination
between senders and receivers during play (Bekoff 1975); and
aggressive displays as enabling their recipients to coordinate with
senders&rsquo; aggressive states of mind (Hinde 1981).</p>

<p>
One key issue in signalling theory concerns the stability of honest
signalling (Maynard-Smith &amp; Harper 2003; Searcy &amp; Nowicky
2005). In cases where senders can benefit by deceiving receivers, the
signalling system is at risk of collapse&mdash;because receivers who
are too often deceived will stop responding to signals. Many cases of
deception have been documented in animal communication. For example,
Photuris fireflies mimic the flashing mating signals of female
Photinus fireflies to prey on the males (Lewis &amp; Cratsley
2008).</p>

<p>
A number of explanations have been offered to explain the stability of
signalling systems. Some scholars have underlined common, cooperative
interest as a stabilising factor in the emergence and maintenance of
signalling systems within and between species (Planer &amp;
Godfrey-Smith 2021; Millikan 2004, 2017). When it is in the interests
of both senders and receivers that receivers appropriately respond to
the states of affairs signalled by the signals, there is little
incentive for signallers to deceive, and signals stabilise. However,
there may also be circumstances when signalling systems can stabilise
even where agents&rsquo; interests do not overlap (Planer &amp;
Godfrey-Smith 2021). Planer &amp; Sterelny (2021) also argue that
communicating in small groups reduces the problem of dishonest
signalling, because where there are multiple senders, and so multiple
sources of information, attempts at deceiving become more risky,
because they are more likely to be discovered.</p>

<p>
Other authors have emphasised the adaptive value of signals that are
hard to fake (Green 2007, 2009). These are relatively common in the
animal kingdom. &lsquo;Indices&rsquo; are signals that are difficult
to fake because they are connected to agents&rsquo; physical
characteristics. For example, tigers leave scratch marks on trees
corresponding to their body size. The higher the marks on a tree, the
larger a tiger must be to have left them&mdash;providing nearby
competitors with reliable estimates of the animal&rsquo;s size.
&lsquo;Handicaps&rsquo; are signals that are hard to fake because they
are costly for the signaller. For example, the tail of a peacock is
large and heavy, hindering the peacock&rsquo;s mobility and
potentially diminishing their chance of survival. Carrying a big tail
is a reliable indicator of health, because only strong peacocks can
bear the energetic cost.</p>

<p>
One recent application of signalling theory is what Green calls
&lsquo;organic meaning&rsquo;, by which he aims to bring together all
instances of meaning in communication (Green 2019). On Green&rsquo;s
account, organic meaning is the transfer of information between a
sender and a receiver that is the product of design. Natural design,
learning mechanisms, and intentional design are all possible ways in
which the signal can provide receivers with information: the notion of
design encompasses, in Green&rsquo;s account, evolutionary, cultural
evolutionary, and intentional tools. In this respect Green&rsquo;s
approach is similar to Millikan&rsquo;s account of intentional signs
(1984, 2017). When a signal is specifically designed to convey
information about an agent&rsquo;s psychological states (including
emotions, intentions, beliefs and desires), it is considered, by
Green, a case of expression (Green 2007).</p>

<p>
Providing receivers with information gives a broad-brush explanation
of why communicative acts are performed. Green&rsquo;s account of
organic meaning can therefore be seen as providing a unified
theoretical framework for the study of communication, since it can be
applied to many communicative interactions in both animals and humans.
An eagle alarm call is, like the utterance of a sentence like
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an eagle&rdquo;, produced to provide receivers
with information about eagles; and there is a sense in which both
kinds of signal were designed for this end. At the same time,
Green&rsquo;s framework is very general: his notion of design is
neutral about the biological, cultural, and psychological processes
underlying signal production. Thus, for all that Green&rsquo;s theory
can help us to understand the properties that many communicative acts
have in common, it has little to say about other features of
communicative behaviour that are important for understanding the
nature and evolution of communication in animals and humans, and which
are not included in this account (Palazzolo forthcoming).</p>

<h3 id="ComForJoiAct">5.2 Communication as a form of joint action</h3>

<p>
While there is a weak, non-psychological notion of cooperation at work
in signalling theory, it is not the kind of cooperation thought
central to human communication by some cognitive scientists, and
characterised by Tomasello as &ldquo;human cooperative
communication&rdquo; (Tomasello 2008). (While Tomasello takes his view
to be the same as Gricean communication, we don&rsquo;t assume that
here.)</p>

<p>
Tomasello&rsquo;s claim that communicating &ldquo;helpfully &hellip;
is extremely rare in the animal kingdom&rdquo; (Tomasello 2008: 5)
incorporates two independent notions of cooperation. The first
concerns the motivations with which agents communicate. Tomasello
distinguishes between communicating to share information and
communicating to make requests or give orders. The former function,
which includes utterances like &ldquo;There are strawberries by the
river&rdquo;, can be produced for reasons that are intended to benefit
the intended recipient, without necessarily benefiting the signaller
(i.e., helpfully). It is paradigmatically (although not always)
performed using assertion-like speech acts. Helpful utterances are
contrasted with utterances produced to benefit the sender, like
&ldquo;Give me that food!&rdquo;. These are paradigmatically (although
not always) performed using directive speech acts.</p>

<p>
The second sense of cooperation to which Tomasello appeals
characterises human communication as a form of &lsquo;shared
intentionality&rsquo; (Bratman 1999: part 2; Jankovic 2014). This term
describes the action characteristic of agents who voluntarily engage
in collaborative activity. Shared intentionality is often thought to
be psychologically demanding in respects comparable to Gricean
communication (Butterfill 2012; Blomberg 2015).</p>

<p>
Tomasello uses the term &lsquo;human cooperative communication&rsquo;
to describe a Gricean (or &lsquo;ostensive-inferential&rsquo; [Sperber
&amp; Wilson 1995]) psychological framework for communication that, he
thinks, is made possible only by the co-presence of communication that
is both helpful, and a form of joint action (see Moore 2018a for
discussion). He holds that communication is a form of shared
intentionality because, at least in human communication, Gricean forms
of pragmatic interpretation are pervasive (Sperber &amp; Wilson 1995).
Since a speaker&rsquo;s message must be inferred from what they say, a
signaller must craft a message to communicate their goal, and their
interlocutor must spend time and effort attending to and interpreting
the signaller&rsquo;s message. Tomasello also proposes a connection
between helpful, informative communication and the kinds of Gricean
pragmatic interpretation that he thinks essential for explaining
language evolution. He argues that Gricean communication arose in
evolutionary history only when speakers and hearers became willing to
invest time and effort interpreting one another&rsquo;s utterances,
and that they did this only when they expected their interlocutors to
provide them with helpful information (Tomasello 2008). As a result,
Tomasello thinks the psychological framework that is characteristic of
Gricean communication evolved in phylogeny only when agents started to
communicate to help others. Since chimpanzees communicate largely to
make requests, and not to share information, Tomasello argues they
cannot be Gricean communicators. This requires motivational (not to
mention cognitive) states not present in the animal kingdom. This
argument purports to explain why chimpanzees are poor at understanding
informative pointing (Tomasello 2006, 2008; Herrmann &amp; Tomasello
2006). Tomasello and colleagues argue that chimpanzees are
fundamentally competitive, not cooperative (Hare &amp; Tomasello
2004). Meanwhile domestic dogs, who have been bred to help humans,
fare much better at understanding helpful points (Hare &amp; Tomasello
2005).</p>

<p>
A number of issues could be raised with this view. First, as
 <a href="#GriPra">Section 4.2</a>
 makes clear, Grice&rsquo;s analysis of meaning<sup>NN</sup> was
specified to incorporate imperative utterances. So Tomasello may be
wrong to think that only unselfish communicators can be Gricean
communicators (Moore 2017c). Furthermore, it may be that while some
forms of communication (e.g., conversation) require &lsquo;shared
intentionality&rsquo;, not all do. If Gricean communicative acts are
not always difficult to interpret then, where the interpretational
demands are reduced, it may be possible for interlocutors to grasp one
another&rsquo;s messages without effortful interpretation. In such
circumstances, the collaborative demands on communication would
decrease (ibid.). Nonetheless, Tomasello may be right that historical
increases in the motivation to attend to and engage with an
interlocutor were driven by agents&rsquo; expecting to benefit from
communicated information. In turn, this may have driven improvements
in pragmatic interpretation, and language evolution, even if these
factors are independent of whether agents are Gricean communicators.
On such a story, one would expect to find more impressive feats of
pragmatic interpretation in attentive species, like domestic dogs, who
do understand informative pointing (Hare &amp; Tomasello 2005), and
perhaps even individual differences between members of the same
species that correlate with social attention (Ben&iacute;tez-Burraco,
Ferretti, &amp; Progovac 2021; Berio &amp; Moore 2023). This would be
a valuable avenue for future research.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, Tomasello&rsquo;s second claim&mdash;that cooperative
communication is uniquely human&mdash;is built on a very limited
sample of animal communication. In part, this is because relatively
little is known about the intentional communication and interpretation
of signals by many species. Even for well understood species, like
dogs and chimpanzees, there is a great deal to learn. For example,
since Tomasello&rsquo;s 2008 book, compelling evidence of voluntary,
helpful communication has been found in chimpanzees, with the
discovery that they call to warn ignorant others of the presence of
sleeping snakes (Crockford, Wittig, &amp; Zuberb&uuml;hler 2017; Moore
2019). For other species, even highly intelligent ones like dolphins,
we know almost nothing about their natural communication. As we learn
more about the animal kingdom, we may gather more evidence of
voluntary, pro-social communication.</p>

<p>
Existing theoretical frameworks for interpreting animal communication
may also underestimate the extent to which it is produced with
helpful, informative goals. For example, Tomasello&rsquo;s claim about
the rarity of helpful communication concerns only voluntary signals.
He is not seeking to characterise evolutionarily conserved alarm calls
that may not be fully under voluntary control, like the alarm calls of
vervet monkeys (Wheeler &amp; Fischer 2012; but see Cheney &amp;
Seyfarth 2018). As such, the question of whether these calls are
cooperative (in the way he thinks rare) does not arise. If it were
subsequently discovered that such calls are produced under voluntary
control, the question of whether they are helpful would reappear. In
recent years, we have learned that chimpanzee vocalisations are the
subject of much more voluntary control than was recently thought to be
the case. As we learn more about the ecology of wild animals, and
better understand the function of their calls, claims about the
motivations underlying calls may therefore be reevaluated.</p>

<h2 id="ConRem">6. Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>
While philosophical work on animal communication is theoretically
disunified, common themes recur in the literature, including questions
about voluntary production, the psychological correlates of signalling
behaviours and their interpretation, concerns about whether or not
animal communication is cooperative, and the extent to which it might
be syntactically complex. Additionally, different approaches may not
always be incompatible, so much as complementary lenses for
characterising different communicative phenomena across the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p>
At the same time, for all that accounts may be complementary,
disagreements about the interpretation of data do arise. Different
explanatory accounts reflect not only the different kinds of
communication in the animal kingdom, but also competing philosophical
commitments. In their interpretations of animal behaviour, some
scholars emphasise richer, more human-like interpretations
(&lsquo;booster&rsquo; views&mdash;e.g., Gricean vs. non-Gricean
accounts of animal communication: compare Moore 2017a with
Scott-Phillips &amp; Heintz 2023), while others advocate for leaner,
deflationary interpretations (&lsquo;scoffer&rsquo; views&mdash;e.g.,
Chomskian accounts of animal semantics). Disagreements may reflect a
more general set of considerations about whether human and animal
minds should be characterised in terms that are continuous, or
discontinuous; and attitudes towards continuity-based explanations may
in turn reflect different valuations of the explanatory principles
that we should bring to bear on the interpretation of animals
minds.</p>

<p>
Competing parsimony principles encourage contrasting explanations of
communicatively relevant behaviours in humans and animals. For
example, eye contact is sometimes interpreted as important for, and so
evidence of, Gricean communication in humans (G&oacute;mez 1994; Moore
2016). Whereas accounts motivated by cladistic parsimony (Sober 2005)
interpret eye contact in great apes as evidence of similar
communicative mechanisms in non-humans, those sympathetic to
Morgan&rsquo;s canon (Morgan 1894; see Andrews &amp; Mons&oacute; 2021
for discussion) may prefer a deflationary interpretation of the same
behaviour (Tomasello 2008; Scott-Phillips 2015). Nonetheless, the
existence of fundamentally different approaches to the explanation of
behaviour remains a feature of animal communication research. As new
data on animal communicative abilities are collected, they will
further constrain the empirically tenable claims that can be made.
Much current research has taken primates as model species, and there
may be much more to learn from different species, including cetaceans
and eusocial insects. With the advent of new AI-driven technologies
for interpreting animal communication, moreover, we may be on the cusp
of thrilling new discoveries (Rutz et al. 2023). Nonetheless, the need
for data to be interpreted, and the existence of competing
explanations of the same behaviours, will ensure that philosophers
have an important contribution to make to the characterisation of
non-human communication.</p>
