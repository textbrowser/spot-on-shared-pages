<h1>Philosophy of Immunology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Dec 22, 2016; substantive revision Thu Jan 22, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Philosophy of immunology, a subdiscipline of philosophy of biology,
explores ontological and epistemological issues related to the studies
of the immune system regarded in its functional multiplicities. While
speculative investigations and abstract analyses have always been part
of immune theorizing, until recently philosophers have largely ignored
immunology. Yet the implications for understanding the philosophical
basis of organismal functions framed by immunity open up perspectives
on fundamental questions about identity, individuality, cognition,
scientific methodology and theory construction. This broad agenda
derives from immunology&rsquo;s multifaceted research program that has
developed from its initial clinical challenges of host defense,
transplantation, autoimmunity, tumor immunology, and allergy. However,
those disciplinary boundaries have been expanded by recent work on
immune processes mediating neuro-endocrine functions and the role of
immunity in mediating ecological relationships, both with the external
environment and the interior holobiont. This broader context
highlights the need to comprehend immunity within the comprehensive
biology of an integrated organ system and the microbiota that compose
its complex ecology. The growing interest of philosophers, science
studies scholars, and the general public has been catalyzed by both
the COVID-19 pandemic as well as recent scientific advancements in
immunology that include new vaccine technologies and immunotherapy
breakthroughs. In addition to these well-established research areas,
the immune system is increasingly recognized as playing a role in
diverse physiological functions, development, ecology, and
evolutionary mechanics. Holding together these diverse domains of
inquiry lie philosophical commitments oriented by organismal identity.
In this regard, several central philosophical questions include how to
understand the immune system&rsquo;s role in determining the
organism&rsquo;s</p>

<ol>

<li>cognition (organization of immune perception and information
processing);</li>

<li>individuality (framed by the ecological context of immune-mediated
assimilation and rejection);</li>

<li>and integration of complex systems (modeled by systems
biology).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Indeed, immunology, in the context of cognitive science, evolutionary
biology, environmental sciences, and development provides multiple
entry points for philosophy of biology. Moreover, studies of immunity
are uniquely positioned to address central problems in
 <a href="../biology-philosophy/">philosophy of biology</a>
 and, more broadly, philosophy of science. These include the
reductionism/holism debate, the characterization of the goals and
methods of systems biology, the organization and character of
cognition and information, and the challenge of integrating complexity
theory with big data studies.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The immune system is typically represented as a system of defense that
protects the organism from pathogens. However, immunity is known to
play other crucial functions that include:</p>

<ul>

<li>wound healing and repairing damaged tissues (Forbes and Rosenthal
2014);</li>

<li>recognizing and destroying cancer cells (Swann and Smyth
2007);</li>

<li>guiding changes during growth and development (Ramos 2012);</li>

<li>helping control how the body uses food for energy (Zmora et al.
2017);</li>

<li>maintaining friendly relationships with bacteria that live in our
gut and on our skin (Kurashima and Kiyono 2017);</li>

<li>playing a role in selecting compatible sexual partners and
preventing incompatible cells from taking residence in the body (Davis
2014);</li>

<li>affecting brain functions including mood, memory, thinking, social
behavior, and the ability to navigate spaces (Dantzer 2018); and</li>

<li>using chemical messages that help control growth and energy use
(Burzyn, Benoist, and Mathis 2013; Davies et al. 2013).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, by responding to the inner and outer environments of the
organism, the immune system participates in multiple capacities to
coordinate diverse physiological functions and to provide
communication between them.</p>

<p>
Despite the multifaceted role of the immune system and its importance
in promoting survival and persistence of all forms of life (Pradeu
2012, 22&ndash;32), immunology has traditionally been of minor
interest to philosophers of biology. However, increased attention has
recently been directed to address a range of ontological and
epistemological problems related to immune phenomena. These
discussions began with examining immunology&rsquo;s theoretical
structure with studies focused on the &ldquo;immune self&rdquo;
&mdash; a fundamental construct of biological identity (Tauber 1994;
Pradeu 2012), which were then expanded to explore the nature of
biological individuality, organism&ndash;environment boundaries and
symbiotic relationships. That perspective requires examining the ways
in which immune processes scale beyond individual organisms to
encompass holobionts, multispecies assemblages, and collective-level
processes in populations (herd immunity) (Zilber-Rosenberg and
Rosenberg 2008; Gilbert, Sapp, and Tauber 2012; Chiu and Gilbert 2015;
Douglas and Werren 2016; Pradeu and Vivier 2016; Gilbert and Tauber
2016; Schneider 2021; 2023). For example, such a widened vantage has
provided new insight into reproductive tolerance, gestation, and
maternal-fetal immunological interactions (Yoshizawa 2016; Nu&ntilde;o
de la Rosa, Pavlicev, and Etxeberria 2021; Morgan 2022).</p>

<p>
In addition, traditional questions pertaining to mind-body
interactions (Boem, Ferretti, and Caiani 2021; Ciaunica, Shmeleva, and
Levin 2023) have assumed new perspectives with advances in
psychoneuroimmunology (Tresker 2022; Greslehner, et al. 2023) that
have prompted philosophical discussions about cognition, perception,
and the formation of psychological selfhood
(S&aacute;nchez-Ram&oacute;n and Faure 2020; Boem et al. 2023).
Metaphorical and narrative frameworks underpinning immunological
discourse have also been critically examined and deconstructed (Martin
1994; Ferri 2018; Zach and Greslehner 2023; Kamenshchikova et al.
2023; Swallow 2023). Thus, immunology raises fundamental questions in
philosophy of biology and science studies concerning identity,
cognition, individuality, organic organization, and ecological
relationships. And with these contributions, immunology joins wider
discussions of agency, a topic of growing interest to philosophers of
biology (e.g., Skewes and Hooker 2009; Arnellos and Moreno 2015;
Okasha 2024; Pickering 2024; Moss 2024; Rosslenbroich, Kummel, and
Bembe 2024; see the entry on
 <a href="../agency/">agency</a>).</p>
 
<p>
While philosophy of immunology has expanded its examination of the
discipline in tandem with its scientific developments, an increasing
diversity of methodological and conceptual approaches have also
emerged in this field. Prominent among these are &ldquo;philosophy in
science&rdquo; (PinS), a research program that integrates
philosophical analysis with rigorous empirical engagement, which
contributes not only to key philosophical debates but also addresses
immune theory and research that bridges philosophical and scientific
communities (Pradeu 2012; Pradeu et al. 2024). Other philosophers
adopt a historical and epistemological orientation, tracing how
immunological concepts evolve in tandem with experimental systems and
sociocultural norms (Tauber 1994; 2017). Feminist, postcolonial, and
STS-inspired thinkers examine the political and ethical dimensions of
immunological metaphors and practices, such as vaccination and public
health interventions (Martin 1990; Haraway 1991; Esposito 2004; Brown
2018). Phenomenologists and enactivist cognitivists approach the
immune system as integral to embodied subjectivity and pre-reflective
agency (Varela et al. 1988; Boem et al. 2023). Finally, relational,
systemic, and ecological perspectives characterize immunity as a
dynamic regulatory network embedded in broader developmental,
metabolic, and environmental contexts (Pradeu 2019a; Tauber 2008;
Da&euml;ron 2025).</p>

<p>
Thus, while still nascent, philosophy of immunology is developing as a
distinctive area of inquiry that integrates diverse theoretical
approaches and methodological frameworks to examine the conceptual
foundations and methodological implications of this science. That
perspective provides new ways of approaching biological organization,
organism-environment interactions, and systemic regulation.
Importantly, such lines of inquiry have proven relevant not only to
philosophy but also to the adjacent scientific domains of theoretical
immunology (Pradeu 2019a; Pradeu 2019b), ecology (Tauber 2017), neuro-
and cognitive sciences (Varela et al. 1988), developmental biology
(Fagan 2007), microbiology (M&eacute;thot and Alizon 2014), and
evolutionary biology (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). And beyond
contributing to discussions within major themes of contemporary
biology, the immunological domain intersects with psychological
(S&aacute;nchez-Ram&oacute;n and Faure 2020), anthropological (Martin
1990), sociological (E. Cohen 2009), political (Esposito 2004;
Mutsaers 2016; Brown 2018; Davis 2022) and socio-cultural fields of
analysis (Wilce 2003). In sum, the wide spectrum of topics addressed,
and the plurality of approaches employed by philosophers of immunology
resonate with broader interests of their philosophy of science
colleagues in which interdisciplinary integration and methodological
pluralism are increasingly recognized as essential for addressing
complex biological phenomena.</p>

<h2 id="OrgaLeveFuncImmuSyst">2. Organism-Level Functions of the Immune System</h2>

<p>
Insofar as maintaining biological integrity is essential for survival,
virtually all organisms must rely on diverse protective immune
functions. From single-cell organisms utilizing the CRISPR&ndash;Cas
system to neutralize viral DNA, to antimicrobial compounds in plants
and pattern recognition receptors in insects, to complex multicellular
immune systems in invertebrates and vertebrates deploying layered
cellular and molecular defenses, the ubiquity of immune strategies is
evident across the tree of life (Pradeu 2019a). Furthermore,
comparative studies suggest that some immune mechanisms are not merely
analogous but derive from conserved molecular modules that have been
retained and repurposed across species (Georjon and Bernheim 2023;
Bonhomme et al. 2025). The diversity and ubiquity of these strategies
suggest that natural selection has shaped immune mechanisms at
different biological levels -- genes, cells, organisms, and
populations &ndash; that must align the integration of diverse
biological units (see the entry on
 <a href="../selection-units/">units and levels of selection</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In vertebrates, immunity is organized through a complex network of
specialized lymphoid organs that support the development and selection
of immune cells to coordinate systemic surveillance and mediation of
environmental encounters (rejection or assimilation). Various organs
(bone marrow, thymus, spleen and lymph nodes) are interconnected by
blood and lymphatic vessels, enabling immune cells and their mediators
to operate as an integrated surveillance and response network.
Vertebrate immunity operates through two evolutionary distinct systems
&mdash; &ldquo;innate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;natural&rdquo;) and
&ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; (or &ldquo;acquired&rdquo;). The evolutionarily
primordial system is composed of a family of
phagocytes&mdash;&ldquo;eating cells&rdquo;&mdash;possessing
distinctive characteristics based on their tissue distribution. They
ingest particulate microbes and destroy effete, cancerous, and damaged
host cells. These cells constitute the first line of the immune
encounter and perform surveillance and restoration functions, while
their related antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are instrumental in
processing ligands for immune processing.</p>

<p>
The innate immune system is integrated with the second arm of
lymphocyte-mediated immunity that is characterized by its highly
specific recognition capabilities and potential to mount enhanced
responses upon subsequent encounter with an antigen (a phenomenon
known as &ldquo;immune memory&rdquo;). Such acquired immunity is
mediated by B and T lymphocytes activated either by APC
first-encounters or as primary responders under certain conditions.
The B lymphocytes produce antibody that recognizes antigens by
structural homology and, correspondingly, T cells have specific
antigen-matching receptors on their cell surface. Both the innate and
acquired immune cellular elements are regulated by a vast array of
soluble molecular factors that serve to either activate or dampen
immune responses. Although they have distinct functional
characteristics and evolutionary history, these two arms of immunity
engage in an extensive crosstalk and molecule exchange that integrates
them into a unified complex system (Pradeu and Du Pasquier 2018).</p>

<p>
Historically, two major theoretical frameworks have modeled immunity.
Early bacteriologists pioneered a defensive perspective that was
re-enforced by discoveries of rejection phenomena associated with
blood transfusion and experimental transplantation in the
mid-twentieth century (Medawar 1944; Burnet 1969). Although the
protective stance has been best studied because of immunology&rsquo;s
early assignment to clinical disease, a complementary constructive and
integrative orientation has gained prominence as attention turned to
how immunity is instrumental in establishing 1) the microbiome,
essential to animal physiology and development, and 2) tolerant
assimilative nutritive processes. The foundation for this dual view
began with Ilya Metchnikoff&rsquo;s late 19th-century studies that
presented inflammation as a mechanism to correct the
&ldquo;disharmony&rdquo; induced by injury, senility and infection
(Tauber and Chernyak 1991, Tauber 2003). He assigned the phagocytes
the key roles of killing pathogens and clearing cellular debris, which
extended his earlier embryological observations of these cells
remodeling tissues (e.g., &ldquo;eating&rdquo; the tadpole&rsquo;s
tail) (see the entry on
 <a href="../biology-developmental/">developmental biology</a>).
 Thus, Metchnikoff&rsquo;s theory of inflammation went well beyond
infectious diseases. For him, immunity included maintaining organismal
integrity in growth, repair, senility, and disease. This medley of
processes comprises immune identity functions, and unlike the early
immunochemists, who were concerned primarily in defining the molecular
mechanisms of immunity, Metchnikoff asked how inflammation served to
establish and then maintain the organism&rsquo;s identity. His query
became nothing less than &ldquo;What is the organism?&rdquo; or, more
specifically developed as immunology matured, What is the self? That
question emerged again after World War II, when immunology turned from
its primary immunochemical concerns to also address biological issues
revolving around tolerance and autoimmunity. With that inflection,
immunology returned to the Metchnikovian problem of how organismal
identity was defined, as opposed to being primarily concerned with
identifying those mechanisms that defend an already well-demarcated
host. With this theoretical agenda, immunology&rsquo;s findings have
carried philosophical implications that resonate with wider debates
about identity and individuality that have since been taken up in
philosophy of biology, cognitive science, and political theory (see
the entry on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="ImmuSelf">2.1 The Immune Self</h3>

<p>
The &ldquo;immune self&rdquo; has served as immunology&rsquo;s
foundational concept of ordering immune theorizing for the past 70
years (Tauber 1994; Silverstein 2009). It originated from the work of
an Australian immunologist, Sir Macfarlane Burnet, who suggested that
the immune system learns to tolerate a defined set of molecules during
embryogenesis (Burnet and Fenner 1949). These molecules that establish
the animal&rsquo;s core identity, persist as a unique essence of a
subject, forming the basis for self-reidentification and
differentiation from others (Burnet 1959, 59). His theory proposed
that autoreactive immune cells (lymphocytes) are purged during
embryonic development to leave only those lymphocytes that ignore
specific antigens encountered during this early stage and thus
directed to &ldquo;nonself&rdquo; (Burnet 1957a). Defined negatively
by a lacuna in the lymphocyte repertoire, immunological selfhood was
assumed to persist in the adult as an invariant molecular
&lsquo;essence&rsquo; of the organism, an interpretation drawing from
commonly held beliefs about Western identity and the psychological ego
(autonomous most prominently) (Burnet 1959; Tauber 1994, 194).</p>

<p>
Danish immunologist Niels Jerne challenged this model by proposing a
self-referential network of antibodies that recognize each other,
thereby establishing internal images of antigens (Jerne 1974).
Influenced by existentialist philosopher S&oslash;ren
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s conception of self-reflexivity (Soderqvist 2003),
the immune system in Jerne&rsquo;s model is not &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to
self as in Burnet&rsquo;s model but actively recognizes itself (the
antibodies), whose identity is disrupted by intrusion of a disrupting
antigen. Otherness, &ldquo;nonself&rdquo; in Burnet&rsquo;s parlance,
is an intruder that alters the equilibrium of the self-referential
network. In this network-centered view, the self is dynamic and
relational, emerging from and maintained by ongoing interactions among
antibodies rather than from a fixed molecular essence (Varela and
Coutinho 1991). While the specific mechanisms Jerne proposed have
generally not been retained as an explanatory basis for immune
reactivity, the underlying idea of internal dynamics was developed
further by the &ldquo;tunable activation threshold&rdquo; (TAT)
framework proposed by Zvi Grossman and William E. Paul. They
conceptualized lymphocyte responsiveness as dynamically adjusted by
the recent history, strength, duration, and frequency of receptor
engagement. On this view, activation thresholds of immune cells are
continually tuned so that persistent, structured signals are
accommodated (tolerated) while abrupt perturbations elicit responses
(Grossman and Paul 1992; 2000; 2001).</p>

<p>
During the 1980s, developments in innate immunity research opened
another line of argument against Burnet&rsquo;s self/nonself model.
Instead of the ligand carrying its status upon binding to T or B cells
(i.e., whether to ignore or to reject), the reaction depended on
interactions with auxiliary cells that served as collective
gatekeepers of the reaction (Medzhitov and Janeway 1997). Charles
Janeway argued that antigen alone does not trigger adaptive immune
responses but requires second signals from APCs. These findings showed
that immune recognition is directed not toward foreignness per se but
toward signals indicating infection carried by evolutionarily
conserved microbial patterns&mdash;a model he termed,
&ldquo;infectious nonself&rdquo; (Janeway 1989; 1992). Subsequently,
Polly Matzinger proposed a more general departure from the
self/nonself model by arguing that immune responses are triggered by
stress- or damage-associated &ldquo;danger&rdquo; signals rather than
by foreignness per se (Matzinger 1994; 2002). Accordingly, immune
activation depends on contextual information distributed across
multiple sensing modes (pattern recognition, damage detection, altered
and missing self, and stress surveillance), rather than fixed,
categorical, pre-determined self/nonself discriminatory determinants
(Carpenter and O&rsquo;Neill 2024; Medzhitov and Iwasaki 2024; Pradeu
et al. 2024).</p>

<p>
Further dismantling the self/nonself model, Thomas Pradeu and Edgardo
Carosella claimed that the immune system responds not to foreignness
as such, but to the rate and pattern of change in antigenic
stimulation that is then interpreted by the immune system as an
activation or tolerant event (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a; 2006b;
Pradeu 2012). This discontinuity hypothesis (also referred to as the
&ldquo;continuity thesis&rdquo;) posits that ligands maintaining
continuous interactions with immune cells, whether genetically
&ldquo;self&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;, are tolerated, while
abrupt changes or disruptions in such interactions trigger immune
rejection responses. The philosophical significance of this theory
lies in its dissolution of the traditional self/nonself dichotomy,
replacing it with a dynamic, relational understanding of immune
identity. This framework provides a unified explanation for phenomena
that challenge classical models: physiological autoimmunity (where the
immune system responds to self tissues), tolerance to commensal
bacteria and persistent viruses, the acceptance of some grafts, and
the complex immunological negotiations required during pregnancy.</p>

<p>
The notion of discontinuity aligns with broader philosophical position
that have moved away from substantialist conceptions of identity
toward dynamic and relational understandings. The classical
self/nonself framework has been interpreted as embodying a
substantialist view, where the immune system is regarded as protecting
an unchanging metaphysical core (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a, 246).
This perspective has been linked to classical philosophical
conceptions of an individual possessing an intrinsic essence (Tauber
1994; Howes 1998), reminiscent of Descartes&rsquo; concept of a
fundamental identity distinct from the physical body (Descartes
2008[1641]). Under this interpretation, the organism appears as a
singular, permanent, and confined unit, with its immune responses
specifically directed against external entities, thereby sharply
defining the organism&rsquo;s boundaries in relation to its
environment (Tauber 2017). In contrast, the discontinuity thesis,
reconceives the organism as an &ldquo;immunological individual,&rdquo;
whose boundaries are dynamic and porous, produced and maintained by
ongoing immune surveillance and regulation rather than a pregiven
identity (Pradeu 2010; 2012). This framework addresses how the immune
system can tolerate entities that are genetically foreign (like
commensal bacteria) while sometimes responding to self tissues,
depending on the temporal and physiological context of the
encounter.</p>

<p>
The non-substantialist reconceptualization has led to the view of
immune identity as &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; (Grignolio et al 2014), where
the immune system is portrayed as participating in mediating
transformations in organismal identity by constantly redefining and
modulating immune reactivity towards endogenous and exogenous
molecules (Tauber 2017). Tolerance of newly encountered antigens
demonstrates the &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; state of the reactive immune
repertoire that undergoes alteration over the lifespan of the
organism. And with a changing &ldquo;immune biography,&rdquo;
biological identity no longer conforms to the simple binary division
of &ldquo;self&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonself&rdquo; that has hitherto
characterized immune theorizing. Accordingly, it has been argued that
living beings have no immutable essence that would ensure persistence
of identity, at least as determined by immune tolerance or rejection
(Le&oacute;n-Letelier, Bonifaz, and Fuentes-Panan&aacute; 2019).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the self/nonself idiom continues to persist in
contemporary immunological discourse as a powerful heuristic tool (cf.
Geenen 2021; Koncz, Balogh, and Manczinger 2024). Defenders of the
self/nonself framework argue that the notion of stabilized
discrimination correctly depicts the immune system&rsquo;s organizing
functions that converge on defending a well-demarcated organism and
efforts to eliminate or modify this construction are misguided
(Hoffman 2012; Anderson 2014). Drawing from the philosophical canon,
Howes referred to Hume to argue that realism about self (immune or
otherwise) can be saved despite the dependency of context and the
ever-changing character of the postulated ego (Howes 1998). She
suggested that the efforts to deny the reality of the self are based
on its non-substantial character and thus reflects entrenched
substantialist assumptions. She proposed that a middle ground exists
between substantial self and no-self by adopting a processual,
understanding of selfhood (Howes 1999), a position that joins rank
with processual philosophy of biology, more generally (Nicholson and
Dupr&eacute; 2018; see the entries on
 <a href="../cell-biology/">philosophy of cell biology</a>;
 <a href="../molecular-biology/">molecular biology</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="ImmuIndi">2.2 Immune Individuality</h3>

<p>
Immunity has traditionally accounted for guarding deleterious
mis-identification of the organism&rsquo;s own tissues (Silverstein
2009), a view extended by early transplantation experiments
demonstrating the immune basis of graft rejection (Loeb 1945; Medawar
1957). These studies suggested that individuals are segregated by a
pattern of unique individuality markers and the history of
immunological encounters that calibrate tolerance and responsiveness.
Symbiosis poses a major challenge to this classical self/nonself
formulation. Instead of such steadfast demarcations, consortia of
organisms comprise symbiotic relationships that are indispensable to
normal development and physiology of the host animal. The resulting
holobiont is both established and maintained by immune processes
(e.g., tolerance, checkpoints, and repair) that regulate and stabilize
host&ndash;microbe integration (Eberl 2016).</p>

<p>
This reconceptualization has challenged the classical anatomic,
physiologic, developmental, and evolutionary criteria of
individuality, inasmuch as &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; are dependent on such
symbiotic &ldquo;others&rdquo; for normal functions (Gilbert, Sapp,
and Tauber 2012). Recognizing that fundamental integration, reorients
the immune schema from the limits of binary decisions to one that
coordinates and synthesizes diverse molecular signals to ceaselessly
monitor the organism&rsquo;s internal state and the surroundings in
which it lives (Cohen 2007a; 2007b). In the context of such dynamic
interchanges, the immune system moves from a static defense force to a
gatekeeper that regulates the terms of interaction between the
organism and its environment (Tauber 2008, 231; Gilbert, Sapp, and
Tauber 2012; Tauber 2017). With this orientation, the classical
defense paradigm has been characterized as an &ldquo;original
teleological sin,&rdquo; insofar as it presupposes that the function
of the immune system is to protect a pre-given, bounded self by
eliminating what is foreign (Da&euml;ron 2025). Rather than being
framed exclusively in terms of the elimination of foreign entities,
immunity has also been described as analogous to the nervous system
(see section 5), in that it integrates biological signals to regulate
interactions with heterogeneous biological partners. This adjudicating
process demotes the singular function of maintaining atomistic
insularity (and associated individuality) for a relational construct
in which environmental challenges offer potential opportunistic
adaptations.</p>

<p>
The role of immunity in defining biological individuality has been
revivified, reframed, and extended by this new appreciation of the
integration and continuity of host&ndash;tissue&ndash;microbe
interactions within the discontinuity theory (Pradeu 2012; Pradeu
2016). As mentioned, on this account immunity detects and reacts to
spatiotemporal discontinuities in the pattern of molecular and
cellular interactions and thus can include or exclude entities based
on these dynamics (Pradeu 2012; Pradeu, Jaeger, and Vivier 2013). This
continuity-based criterion and its reliance on the history of
inter-relationships allow symbionts, microchimeric cells, and even
some grafts to count as constituents of physiological individuality
(Pradeu 2012). In contrast, disruptions of stable states caused by
infection, malignant transformation, or tissue damage elicit rejection
or remodeling responses. Based on this view of immune-mediated
individuality, animal boundaries are dynamic, porous, and contingent
on the dynamics of host&ndash;tissue&ndash;microbe interactions. This
model expands the standard criteria of biological individuality based
on functional autonomy, mutually interdependent parts, genetic
homogeneity, and spatial boundaries (Clarke 2010) (see the entry on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Insofar as the concept of &ldquo;immune individuality&rdquo;
identifies the principle of cohesion offered by immune regulation that
unifies its parts functionally, this emphasis on integration aligns
with &ldquo;physiological individuality,&rdquo; understood as a
continuous and functionally unified organization of parts (Pradeu
2016). Although complementary to the concept of &ldquo;evolutionary
individuality,&rdquo; the idea of &ldquo;physiological
individuality&rdquo; differs from the former in that it focuses on the
mechanisms of how components maintain the functional unity of an
organism rather than on reproductive success or evolutionary fitness,
by asking which processes provide the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that holds
them together (Pradeu 2012; 2016).</p>

<p>
The ambiguity of the boundaries of individuality is well exemplified
in pregnancy, where the maternal immune system must tolerate
&ldquo;foreign&rdquo; fetal cells. Pregnancy presents a paradox posing
a metaphysical dilemma where the fetus is both physiologically
distinct yet dependent on its mother (Medawar 1953). This duality has
led to varied interpretations: some view the fetus as an integral part
of the mother, akin to a limb (Rothman 1989; Kingma 2019), while
others emphasize its physiological autonomy (Smith &amp; Brogaard
2003; Howsepian 2008). Although embryonic antigens are recognized by
the maternal immune system, they do not normally trigger rejection but
rather lead to a variety of responses that help to restructure the
architecture of the uterus and promote regulated fetal development.
Delineation of the role of inflammation during blastocyst implantation
further supports this interactive perspective, demonstrating that
instead of acting as a rejection response, inflammation promotes a
mutually tolerant fusion between the embryo and the mother (Griffith
et al. 2017; Mor, Aldo, and Alvero 2017). Indeed, the transformation
of an inflammation-induced reaction pathway into a cell
differentiation pathway in decidual stromal cells exhibits the
intimate connection of the immune and reproductive systems in
eutherians (G. Wagner, Erkenbrack, and Love 2019; Nu&ntilde;o de la
Rosa, Pavlicev, and Etxeberria 2021).</p>

<p>
These findings further challenge traditional self-nonself
discrimination schema by underscoring the ambiguous nature of
fetal-maternal exchanges (Weasel 2001; Howes 2007; 2008; Yoshizawa
2016). Some authors interpret the immune evidence differently,
maintaining that the fetus is recognized as foreign by the maternal
immune system (Devanesan 2024). So, the case of gestation leaves
unresolved questions about whether the mother and fetus constitute one
or two individuals. The maternal immune system&rsquo;s perception of
the fetus is pivotal in this discussion: When the developing embryo is
regarded as a &ldquo;semi-allogeneic graft,&rdquo; it is perceived in
terms of a separate entity (Medawar 1953); conversely, tolerance of
fetal antigens like self-tissues implies a unified whole. So, asking
whether the mother&rsquo;s immune system recognizes the fetus as self
or foreign provides an empirical perspective on the philosophical
definition of individuality, which as noted, leaves the issue
unresolved and highlights the dilemmas of defining biological
individuality.</p>

<p>
Another example of this conceptual challenge arises in the doctrine of
immunosurveillance of cancer. When the immune system&rsquo;s role was
primarily envisaged as shaped by evolutionary selection to recognize
altered endogenous molecules (neoantigens), malignancy presented as
transformed &ldquo;self&rdquo; equivalent to foreign molecules. Such
antigens then were expected to activate immune responses as a
consequence of the general surveillance function directed at
eliminating intruders (Burnet 1957b; Thomas 1959). Michod argued in
this context that multicellularity is stabilized by conflict-mediating
&ldquo;policing&rdquo; mechanisms that mediate internal selection of
cellular development. The immune system, together with programmed cell
death and early germ&ndash;soma separation, serve as the major
regulatory functions that preserve organismal integrity (Michod 1999;
Michod 2003). Accordingly, when these mechanisms fail, internal
selection reemerges as somatic &ldquo;cheating,&rdquo; prompting the
view that cancer constitutes a &ldquo;deunification of an
individual&rdquo; (Pradeu 2019a, 29&ndash;43). However,
&ldquo;policing&rdquo; understood as immune-mediated elimination of
cellular defectors is complicated by studies of cancer immunoediting,
which involves the capacity of the immune system not only to attack a
tumor but also to reshape its cancerous evolution and even promote its
growth and escape (Dunn et al. 2002). In such scenarios, the role of
the immune system in preserving an organism&rsquo;s individuality
becomes ambiguous due to the duality of both promoting and suppressing
malignancy (Pradeu 2019a).</p>

<p>
Again, rather than adhering to a binary concept of individuality,
cancer (like pregnancy) has been considered to exhibit intermediate
stages of discriminatory differences, so autonomy (or any criterion of
individuality) has been viewed as a processual matter. Individuality
in this framework falls on a spectrum that is more fluid and dynamic
than the rigid dichotomy originally proposed in Burnet&rsquo;s
self/nonself model: the fetus is not strictly categorized as self or
foreign by the immune system, and similarly, cancer is not merely an
altered &ldquo;self&rdquo; recognized by immune surveillance. Moving
away from binary distinctions and relinquishing firm epistemological
criteria requires more flexible ways of explicating biological
identity and more specifically, individuality. Given this ambiguity
and the parochial assumptions about individuality prevalent in various
fields of biology that have found no ready application in immunology,
it seems fair to conclude that no single account suffices (Pradeu
2010; 2012; Guay &amp; Pradeu 2016). Part of the conundrum may lie in
the efforts to consider the issue at the metaphysical, rather than at
the epistemological level (Love and Brigandt 2017; Love 2018). Indeed,
the status of the &ldquo;immune self&rdquo; is a fecund case in
point.</p>

<h2 id="EcoImmu">3. Eco-Immunology</h2>

<p>
While contemporary immunology is dominated by its traditional research
concerns centered on clinical immunity, a discernible theoretical
inflection has emerged in studying immune phenomena situated in the
animal&rsquo;s larger ecological context. This relational orientation
examines how immunity mediates host-environmental (both inner and
exterior) interactions rather than focusing solely on the autonomous
organism. The organism-environment construct offers a more complex
conception of the organism and the immune mechanisms that mediate
these relationships (Tauber 2017). While the ecological view of
immunity was initially developed in the context of disease ecology in
an epidemiological context (Burnet and White 1972), the current
emergence of eco-immunology studies symbiotic ecosystems, mutualistic
host&ndash;microbe dynamics, and population-level interactions among
somatic cells (as in cancer ecology and somatic evolution). By
introducing notions of adaptation, competition, and cooperation into
accounts of immunity, broader questions of natural selection and
evolution beyond the biology of the individual organism point to the
immune system&rsquo;s more general roles.</p>

<p>
This expanded formulation aligns with integrative ecological
approaches in developmental biology, physiology, cancer biology, and
molecular ecosystems, which analyze somatic phenomena in terms of
population-level dynamics and interdependencies (Karasov,
Mart&iacute;nez del Rio, and Caviedes-Vidal 2011; van Baalen and
Huneman 2014; Nathan 2014; Gilbert and Epel 2015; Maley et al. 2017).
Those recent developments build on nineteenth-century ideas in which
somatic cells were depicted as social organisms forming stable
associations (Reynolds 2018, 12&ndash;58). Assuming such interactions
serve the welfare of the organism, Virchow described a &ldquo;cell
state&rdquo; (or &ldquo;cell republic&rdquo;), a metaphor that
informed sociological models of cellular communication (Virchow 1858
[1863]; R. Wagner 1999; Reynolds 2018, 86&ndash;113). Pathologically,
this consortium was likened to a &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; of competing
cell lines, a Darwinian model depicting an internal struggle for
existence throughout an individual&rsquo;s life (Roux 1881 [2024];
Queller and Strassmann 2009; Godfrey-Smith 2009). Metchnikoff&rsquo;s
harmonious/disharmonious schema treated cells as operating under
Darwinian principles similar to those guiding organismal adaptation to
changing environments (Buss 1987; Swiatczak 2023), thereby offering a
common framework for understanding dynamic biological
communities&mdash;whether internal cell lines or organisms
&mdash;adjusting to their milieu (Metchnikoff 1901 [1905]; Tauber and
Chernyak 1991). This dynamic orientation appears in various
theoretical guises but collectively underlie the challenges posed to
static notions of individuality and the promotion of dialectical
constructs instead (Levins and Lewontin 1985).</p>

<p>
Since Koch, struggle and cooperation in immune contexts were often
attributed to intrinsic characteristics of invading microbes that, due
to virulence factors and other gene-encoded traits, act as either
pathogens, commensals, or mutualists (M&eacute;thot and Alizon 2014).
More recent accounts reconsider microbial virulence as an emergent
property dependent on host and microbial factors whose interactions
are not derivable from first principles (Casadevall, Fang, and
Pirofski 2011). Disease causation is thus presented as a multifaceted
interaction within a dynamic ecological system, where health versus
pathology results from complex interplays among species and
environmental conditions that defy simple self/nonself distinctions
(Schneider 2023). Within such frameworks, immunity and individuality
are described in terms that emphasize interdependent relationships
between hosts and their microbial communities (Schneider 2021). This
shift in focus from intrinsic pathogenicity to ecological accounts
reflects changed epistemic assumptions about what observations matter
and how causal adequacy is judged in host&ndash;microbe research
(Schneider 2020). Within feminist philosophy of science, this shift
reflects epistemic values that prioritize interactions and context
over pathogen-centered causation (Schneider 2025).</p>

<p>
Ecological approaches to immunity analyze parasitism, commensalism,
and mutualism as bidirectional exchanges through which microbes and
hosts construct ecological niches. These perspectives draw attention
to tolerogenic mechanisms that permit assimilation of commensal
microbes and inform models of coordinated interaction among somatic
cell populations, offering a counterpoint to views of the immune
system as primarily pathogen-eliminating. The concept of disease
tolerance, derived from plant ecology and applied to animal immunity,
exemplifies this reorientation. Tolerance describes a host defense
strategy that reduces the negative impact of infection on host fitness
without affecting pathogen burden, operating instead through tissue
protection, stress responses, and repair mechanisms (Medzhitov,
Schneider, and Soares 2012). Within this framework, concepts of
pathogenicity and individuality are reconsidered to accommodate
stabilized host&ndash;microbe relations and somatic ecosystems. The
individual animal is described as a complex ecological
community&mdash;engaging in cooperation and competition&mdash;rather
than as a singular, autonomous entity conceived as under assault.
Accordingly, organismal boundaries and identities emerge through
ongoing relational processes&mdash;both adversarial and
opportunistic&mdash; whose outcomes are determined by contextual
factors, not by fixed, essentialist properties.</p>

<p>
From this perspective, shifting the focus of inquiry from individuals
to ecosystems complicates core distinctions such as self/nonself,
pathogen/commensal, immune/non-immune, and organism/environment. The
interface between the genetic body and resident microbes is framed
less as a defensive frontline and more as an ecological
ecotone&mdash;an interactive zone where cellular communities negotiate
adaptive possibilities (Tauber 2008). The importance of such
interfaces is illustrated by mutual scaffolding and niche-construction
strategies used by microbial symbionts and hosts to guide the
development of larger ecological units (holobionts) (Chiu and Gilbert
2015). Recent evidence portrays boundaries among parasitism,
commensalism, and mutualism as flexible and contingent on host
factors, microbiota dynamics, and environmental conditions (e.g.,
temperature, nutrients) (M&eacute;thot and Alizon 2014). Some authors
relate contemporary views of plasticity, pathogenicity, and virulence
to nineteenth-century concepts of microbial&ndash;host equilibrium
(M&eacute;thot 2012). In disease ecology, long-lasting
host&ndash;parasite associations have been modeled as climax states
with stable population levels (Burnet and White 1972; Anderson 2004).
Immune equilibrium models describe persistent viral colonization as a
&ldquo;dynamic but metastable equilibrium between the virome and the
host&rdquo; (Virgin, Wherry, and Ahmed 2009; Eberl 2010).
Eco-immunology&rsquo;s emphasis on balance highlights states in which
offensive and defensive forces neutralize one another to form stable
associations with minimal impairment to either party (Swiatczak 2014).
On this basis, eco-immunology is often presented as complementary to
older clinical orientations and as a source of additional medical
strategies.</p>

<h2 id="ImmuEvol">4. Immunity and Evolution</h2>

<p>
The environmental perspective not only refers to the application of
ecological and evolutionary perspectives to immune modeling, but also
includes lessons learned from studies of immunity that reciprocally
inform current understanding of evolution. How these findings shed
light on the character of evolutionary change is well-illustrated by
the research of heritable immune variation. The origin of variation
has been subject to much debate in philosophy of biology. Advocates of
the view that non-random, environmentally induced factors are involved
in the generation of heritable variation cite evidence of
stress-induced mutagenesis, horizontal gene transfer, and non-genetic
systems of inheritance (Koonin 2012, 257&ndash;291; Veigl 2022). Such
discoveries have been interpreted as suggesting that organisms may
enhance their own adaptation to altered environmental conditions
epigenetically (J. Shapiro 2011; Jablonka and Lamb 2014). These
mechanisms raise philosophical questions about whether the response to
specific environmental cues that leads to alterations of phenotypic
features, when transmitted to succeeding generations, should be
considered Lamarckian (Sarkar 1991; Depew and Weber 1996).
Notwithstanding evidence for such mechanisms, postulated non-random
mechanisms of evolution have been disputed by those who claim that
appeals to Lamarckism are misguided and stem from mis-interpreting the
Neo-Darwinian synthesis (Merlin 2010; Weiss 2015).</p>

<p>
The CRISPR-Cas system in prokaryotes provides a compelling case study
for these philosophical debates about evolutionary mechanisms. Many
bacteria and most Archaea possess this adaptive immune system that
allows them to incorporate foreign DNA fragments and use them as
templates for defense against future invasions (Horvath and Barrangou
2010; Koonin 2019). In simple terms, CRISPR works by capturing short
pieces of invader DNA, storing them as a record, and later using that
record to recognize and disable matching sequences. One might regard
this as the inheritance of environmentally acquired
information&mdash;without implying foresight or purpose&mdash;where
exposure to a phage leaves a heritable molecular &ldquo;memory&rdquo;
that shapes later responses. Because such changes arise through
interaction with the environment and can be transmitted to
descendants, some authors have described CRISPR&ndash;Cas as a
Lamarckian mechanism (Koonin 2012, 265; Koonin 2019). This
interpretation remains controversial. Critics argue that although
failing to conform to the neo-Darwinian paradigm, this system seems to
lack the teleological character originally postulated by Lamarck and
thus better regarded as a model of directed mutagenesis (Weiss 2015;
Wideman et al. 2019; Woolley et al. 2019). Others counter that a
continuum of Lamarckian-Darwinian mechanisms exists in nature, and
that CRISPR-Cas represents an instance of a directional evolutionary
process complementing a variety of random, selective mechanisms
(Koonin and Wolf 2016; Jablonka 2019). Advocates of this more
inclusive interpretation place CRISPR-Cas systems among other
non-Darwinian mechanisms like those mediating epigenetic inheritance
and thus advocate for a more dynamic and complex framework for
understanding evolution than previously acknowledged (Gissis and
Jablonka 2011). These debates illustrate ongoing tensions in
evolutionary theory about the role of directed versus random
change.</p>

<p>
Similar philosophical questions arise from vertebrate adaptive
immunity. The genetic mechanisms of immune specificity involve
processes that challenge traditional evolutionary frameworks. When
exposed to antigens, lymphocytes undergo selection based on receptor
binding fitness, followed by hypermutation processes that further
refine specificity (Tonegawa, et al. 1974; Podolsky and Tauber 1997;
Swiatczak 2020). The philosophical significance is that this process
exemplifies non-random selection and adaptation (Simon, Hollander, and
McMichael 2015). As the process of hypermutation acts on pre-selected
cells to improve adaptive fit of their receptors to ligands, the
outcomes appear biased in ways that some argue fail exact criteria of
Neo-Darwinism (cf. Dobzhansky 1970).</p>

<p>
The elucidation of the genetic mechanisms of immune specificity has
broader implications for understanding selection as a general
principle (Darden and Cain 1989; Podolsky and Tauber 1997; Hull,
Langman, and Glenn 2001). The clonal selection theory (CST), the
foundational framework of modern immunology, states that the immune
system relies on a Darwinian-like process of selection to permit
differential expansion of lymphocytes, whose receptors are fitted to
bind an antigen (Burnet 1959). This has philosophical significance as
CST has been compared to other selective theories as an example of a
more general principle applicable to modeling cycles of replication,
variation, and environmental interaction (Darden and Cain 1989; Hull,
Langman, and Glenn 2001) and as a guide for future selective theories,
e.g., neural group selection (cf. Edelman 1974; 1987). Differences
between selection theories have also been recognized and suggest that
unlike evolution of species, selection in somatic systems (e.g., the
neural system) does not fully account for the adaptation of the
developing populations (Dumouchel 1996).</p>

<p>
The phenomenon of vertical immune transfer raises additional
philosophical questions about inheritance. Maternal antibodies may be
passed on to descendants, allowing progeny to inherit some of the
acquired immune characteristics of their parents. For example, the
composition of the microbiota mothers pass on to the infant through
vaginal and breastfeeding routes not only constructs a microbial model
for offspring but also programs the newborn&rsquo;s immune system and
metabolism (Chiu and Gilbert 2015; Mueller et al. 2015; Gomez de
Ag&uuml;ero et al. 2016). When viewed through an evolutionary lens,
the acquisition of an infant&rsquo;s immune characteristics
exemplifies how the environment may influence inheritance, where
transmission of selective pressures from one generation to another
pre-sets the progeny&rsquo;s adaptation to the environment
(Odling-Smee, Laland, and Feldman 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2013).
These findings have been interpreted as challenging traditional
Darwinian and Lamarckian categories with wide-ranging ramifications in
biology. Indeed, such a general scheme may be relevant in cognitive
science and linguistics, as well as in other disciplinary domains
outside of the life sciences (Piattelli-Palmarini 1986).</p>

<h2 id="ImmuCognLang">5. Immune Cognition and Language</h2>

<p>
The immune system has long been characterized with cognitive
terminology &mdash; &ldquo;recognition,&rdquo; &ldquo;learning,&rdquo;
&ldquo;memory,&rdquo; and &ldquo;decision making&rdquo; &mdash; though
such linguistic choices have generated considerable debate within the
field (cf. Rosengarten 2023; Cola&ccedil;o 2025). Beyond mere
metaphorical convenience of telescoping complicated phenomena, the
functional parallels exhibited by the immune and nervous systems
suggest that they may share a common information-processing
architecture, forms of computation, and signal integration and thus
offer complementary insights (Cohen 1992a; 1992b). However, related
analyses have emphasized that such parallels between immune and neural
functions are best understood at the level of relational physiology
without implying that the immune system is cognitive in a
representational or mental sense (Vaz 2011; Tauber 2017,
157&ndash;158; Da&euml;ron 2025). Distinct from these conceptual
debates, empirical research has demonstrated extensive bidirectional
interaction between immune and nervous systems, including molecular
signaling pathways, which coordinate functions that cannot be
attributed exclusively to any of these systems in isolation (Pradeu
2019a; Kamimura et al. 2020; Gough 2024). These findings do not by
themselves settle questions about immune mediated cognition, but they
nevertheless have informed philosophical discussions about the
embodiment of cognition and the possible extension of cognitive
processes beyond strictly neural substrates (cf. Ciaunica, Shmeleva,
and Levin 2023).</p>

<h3 id="ExteCogn">5.1 Extended Cognition</h3>

<p>
Philosophical implications of immune-neural integration challenge
traditional views of cognition confined to the brain. Although the
brain was historically conceived as immunologically privileged
(isolated by the blood-brain barrier), contemporary research has
revealed extensive bidirectional communication between neural and
immune systems (Villabona-Rueda et al. 2019). Immune cells engage in
reciprocal molecular crosstalk with neurons through diverse shared
molecular mediators, coordinating neurodevelopmental, inflammatory,
and repair processes that raise fundamental philosophical questions
about cognition (Raanes and Stiles 2021; Rengasamy et al. 2021).</p>

<p>
The potential of immune cells to process information and coordinate
responses has been used to support the view that cognition is not
confined to neural processing alone but relies on computational
processes distributed across all cellular systems in the body
(Ciaunica, Shmeleva, and Levin 2023). The advocates of this
perspective challenge the neuro-centric view of cognition by
demonstrating how cellular and molecular immune networks integrate
cellular decision-making and thereby coordinate local responses of
individual cells to collectively determine systems-level behavior
(Ciaunica, Shmeleva, and Levin 2023). On this view, we literally
&ldquo;think with all the cells of our bodies,&rdquo; which positions
the immune system not merely as a supportive network but as an
integral component of a multiscale cognitive architecture that spans
from cellular to organismal levels of biological organization
(Ciaunica, Shmeleva, and Levin 2023). Accordingly, cognition extends
as a function of the entire organism, an interpretation which accepts
that cognition is mediated by systems that can be described partly in
physical terms, but the molecules and cells making up the immune
system obtain their global functionality only when the organism is
considered in its totality. Simply, the organism confers the cognitive
properties upon the immune system, not vice versa and to confuse these
different kinds of description could be considered as the
&ldquo;mereological fallacy&rdquo; (Bennett and Hacker 2003).</p>

<p>
The role of the microbiota adds another layer of complexity. The
extension of immune system processing beyond somatic components to
incorporate microbial factors establishes the foundation for the
concept of &ldquo;co-immunity,&rdquo; an extended form of immunity
encompassing the host and its symbiotic microbiota (Bazin, Chiu and
Pradeu 2022). This perspective depicts the microbiota not as passive
residents of the host systems but as active participants in immune
regulation that constitutes a complex web of responses that profoundly
impact host health and wellbeing (Chiu et al. 2017; Pull and McMahon
2020; Bazin, Chiu and Pradeu 2022). This enactivist perspective
represents more than just another characterization of cognition. The
evidence for integrated nervous, immune, and endocrine systems
challenges the reductionist &ldquo;building block model&rdquo; that
has long dominated biological theorizing (Ader 2006; Greslehner et al.
2023). Dispensing with discrete, modular functions with predetermined
roles represents a significant shift from mechanistic frameworks, in
which organisms conceptualized as assemblages of independent parts are
reconceived with a more holistic, relational ontology. In this
reconceptualization, biological functions emerge from dynamic
interactions between co-evolved systems rather than existing as
intrinsic properties of isolated components (Greslehner et al. 2023).
A parallel philosophical problem arises in conceptualizing immunity
itself. By expanding the functional immune repertoire beyond defence
to encompass development, repair, metabolism, and homeostasis, the
immune system loses precise ontological boundaries (Zach and
Greslehner 2022). Within these formulations immunity emerges as a
property arising from the interactions of multiple physiological
networks. Such complexity demands new conceptual models capable of
capturing such complex phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="InfoProcComm">5.2 Information Processing and Communication</h3>

<p>
The conceptualization of immunity as information processing has deep
historical roots that originated in Burnet&rsquo;s suggestion that
immune recognition involves information-like processes, where he
interpreted molecular interactions in terms of signalling and
communication (Burnet 1956; Tauber 1994). These ideas emerged within
mid-twentieth-century theoretical biology, influenced by cybernetics
and systems theory, including interdisciplinary exchanges such as the
1952 &ldquo;Information Theory in Biology&rdquo; symposium organized
by Henry Quastler (Burnet 1956, 164&ndash;165).</p>

<p>
The broader adoption of the term &ldquo;immune system&rdquo; in the
1960s coincided with an increasing interest in the organism as
governed by an integrated regulatory system. This development was part
of a more general movement in biology toward systemic and
computational modes of explanation, drawing analogies with control
theory, neural networks, and models of distributed computation (Wiener
1961; Moulin 1989). Insofar as immune receptors were originally
conceived as sensors capable of decoding environmental signals, this
conceptual alignment reinforced the idea of immunity as an
information-processing network analogous to the nervous system (Tauber
1994, 161&ndash;163; Cohen 2000). Computational models of immunity,
including agent-based simulations and artificial immune system
algorithms, have further developed this analogy -- treating immune
functions as responses to a form of distributed information
processing. Unlike the brain, no centralized controller directs the
immune response that emerges from local interactions among numerous
immune components (Forrest and Hofmeyr 2001). This distributed
processing challenges traditional notions of control and agency in
biological systems. While such models have proven useful for
simulating immune behaviour, they have also raised questions about the
nature of biological information, the scope of representational
frameworks in the life sciences, and the relevance of computational
metaphors in immunology (Cohen and Efroni 2019). These debates reflect
broader philosophical questions about how information, meaning, and
identity are generated and regulated in biological systems. The
convergence of cognitive science and immunology thus offers a
productive arena for exploring fundamental questions about the nature
of cognition, information, and biological organization.</p>

<h2 id="ReduVersHoliModeImmu">6. Reductionist versus Holistic Models of Immunity</h2>

<p>
Immunology provides rich case studies for examining debates about
reductionism versus holism and the role of theory in the biomedical
sciences (see the entry on
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>).
 For example, Schaffner, in his criticism of the classical view of
scientific theories, provided a detailed analysis of the clonal
selection theory and the two-step model of immune activation to
illustrate what he called, middle-range theories that consist of
interrelated theoretical models (Schaffner 1980). While early
commentators posited theory as the essential platform for conducting
meaningful scientific exchanges, more complex sociological factors
have suggested nuanced interplay between theory and practice (Fagan
2023). For instance, interdisciplinary partnerships between clinicians
and immunologists demonstrate that healthcare solutions can be
fostered without a unifying framework, thereby transcending conceptual
boundaries and encouraging the exploration of innovative strategies. A
taxonomy of immune models (both conceptual and experimental) further
highlights how a medley of diverse approaches is required for
investigative advances (Baetu 2014).</p>

<p>
While theory holds a prominent place in modeling immune phenomena,
integrative hypotheses are still required to make sense of complex
biological phenomena and to facilitate the translation of research
findings into clinical applications. Immunology exemplifies how
theoretical unification can guide research while avoiding
oversimplification: Immune responses must be understood not as
isolated cellular events, but as phenomena shaped by the context
determined by multiple biological systems. Such integrative approaches
serve important heuristic functions in synthesizing findings into
actionable medical strategies. Beyond serving as an exemplar for
theoretical integration, immunology has also been employed to develop
cognitivist models, elucidate conceptual and theoretical change in
biology, and elaborate on contentious issues about reductionism and
anti-reductionism.</p>

<p>
Apart from elucidating issues pertaining to identity and individuality
in the animal&rsquo;s broader ecological and evolutionary history,
philosophy of immunology also contributes to discussions about the
origin, organization, and methods of biological knowledge. Reflecting
on explanatory practices of immunology, epistemic analysis has an
important practical dimension that contributes to developing
methodological strategies and conceptual tools to handle the
complexity of the immune response. As immunologists grapple with
increasing data complexity, genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic
studies are producing vast amounts of data with only a modest
understanding of the basic organization and regulation that must
integrate systems-level and molecular-level approaches (Ohno 1990;
Schatz and Langmead 2013; see the entry on
 <a href="../genomics/">genomics and postgenomics</a>).
 This challenge has intensified historical debates about the most
appropriate methodological approach to understanding immunity, which
have echoed long-standing tensions between reductionist and holistic
approaches in the life sciences more generally (see the entry on
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>).
 While reductionism aims to explain immune phenomena by reference to
molecular or genetic mechanisms, holistic perspectives emphasize
system-level interactions, such as network dynamics and environmental
context. This tension plays out in discussions of immune system
modularity versus integration and then defining the modalities in
which cells, inter-active signals, and systemic properties might best
be modeled.</p>

<p>
Both reductive and holistic immunological research agendas have vied
for dominance throughout the history of the discipline (Silverstein
2009, 25&ndash;42). The immune-chemical program, championed by Ehrlich
and other immunochemists during the first half of the twentieth
century, examined immune reactions in terms of chemical and physical
characteristics governing binding of ligands to their immune receptors
(Silverstein 2009, 456). These immunochemists were adopting a
&ldquo;unifactorialism&rdquo; strategy that endeavors to explain
complex biological processes in terms of single factors. That program
was modified and renewed by the elucidation of the genetics of
antibody diversification, a series of discoveries that placed
immunology well within the molecular biology revolution (Podolsky and
Tauber 1997).</p>

<p>
Alternative approaches emerged from those who argued that purely
reductionist methods could not capture immune complexity. Early
advocates of such approaches, like Metchnikoff, described immunity in
terms of cells and cellular interactions, a &ldquo;biological&rdquo;
perspective extended by Burnet, who attempted to integrate molecular
processes with organismal-level phenomena (Crist and Tauber 2000;
Baxter 2006, 38). He presented immunity in terms of adaptation,
selection, and population-level cell behavior, rather than solely in
terms of chemical and physical molecular reactions. As already
discussed, this broadened biological perspective introduced the
&lsquo;self&rsquo; into the immune lexicon and brought new figurative
language associated with agency and a host of metaphors borrowed from
other human experience. Yet crucially, Burnet also postulated the
existence of molecular signatures of self and considered lymphocyte
receptors as independent decision-makers mediating immune reactions
based on their binding of cognate antigens (Burnet 1969).
Burnet&rsquo;s approach thus demonstrated that holistic and
reductionist approaches need not be mutually exclusive. By
representing cases of theoretical integration and explanatory
heterogeneity, epistemic strategies adopted by Burnet and other
organism-oriented immunologists fit into the inclusion of plurality
and unification increasingly regarded as necessary to capture the
complexity of immunity.</p>

<p>
Contemporary systems biology approaches attempt to transcend the
reductionism-holism divide (Mazzocchi 2012; Green et al. 2018). After
all, attempts to explain complex immunological phenomena in terms of
isolated parts and interactions without taking into consideration the
global structural and functional complexity that these phenomena
exhibit have been ineffective. For example, vaccine development
studies, when limited to investigation of the structural correlates of
antigen-antibody interaction without deeper understanding of the
dynamic features of a host-pathogen encounter, often proved
unsuccessful (Van Regenmortel 2002). So, instead of assuming that
non-reductionist explanations must ignore lower-level molecular
details, system-oriented immunologists attempt to model the multilevel
complexity of the immune reactions they study (Rivas et al. 2017).</p>

<p>
Dynamical systems theory and a variety of network-based approaches are
used in systems biology to integrate distinct levels of analysis and
elucidate the complexity of the biological phenomena in question
(Green et al. 2018). Within this framework, computer simulations have
treated the immune system as a non-equilibrium dynamical system, whose
endogenous fluctuations generate shifting patterns of activity much
like a weather system rather than a stable baseline merely perturbed
by antigenic input (Perelson 1988). Such complex dynamics suggest that
even complete mechanistic understanding may not be sufficient to
explain immune behavior without situating those mechanisms within
their broader dynamical and contextual settings. In fact,
systems-oriented approaches increasingly emphasize the necessity of
integrating both molecular and higher orders of analysis, reflecting a
broader epistemic shift away from single-level explanations toward
integrative methodologies (cf. L&ouml;wy 2008, 172; see the entry on
 <a href="../systems-synthetic-biology/">philosophy of systems and synthetic biology</a>).</p>
 
<p>
However, the program of melding the reductionist and holistic methods
as complementary to each other has been slowed by both technical and
conceptual hurdles (Fang and Casadevall 2011). How to model the system
as a system requires the collection of information about the totality
of interactions to explain causal interactions with multiple inputs
and stochastic outcomes. No approach has achieved dominance and,
consequently, the question of how massive data might be incorporated
into a systems-wide comprehensive model comprises a key challenge of
contemporary immunology (Das and Jayaprakash 2019).</p>

<h2 id="ImmuSociDime">7. Immunology&rsquo;s Social Dimensions</h2>

<p>
From its inception, the self&rsquo;s appearance in immunology served
as a readily understood shorthand reference to personal identity, and
the efforts to substantiate that extrapolation on its own terms guided
the discipline for the latter half of the twentieth century (for
historical case studies see L&ouml;wy 1991). Commentators have
observed how immunology&rsquo;s conceptual framework extends beyond
the experimental science by drawing from wider social meanings of
individuality and insularity (Tauber 2016). The autonomous
construction of identity resonates with Western civic ideals and in
turn supports them by melding laboratory findings with various
extrapolated or borrowed philosophical, political, and psychological
formulations of human agency (E. Cohen 2009). And conversely,
immunology has been studied as a source of important metaphors and
other tropes feeding back on the science&rsquo;s supporting culture to
transform understanding of agency and communal relationships.</p>

<p>
The imagery of the foreign, whether absorbed or rejected, underlies
popular understandings of immunity and provides a vivid case study of
bidirectional links between science and society. The
self&ndash;nonself discrimination model portrays immunity as policing
a bounded self, a picture that some philosophers of immunology have
argued is theoretically and empirically limited (Fleck 1935 [1979];
Tauber 1994; 2016; Howes 1999). As discussed earlier, phenomena such
as tolerance, symbiosis, and developmental chimerism have been
interpreted as motivating a relational understanding of
immune-mediated identity and challenging the autonomy of the organism
as a basic organizational unit.</p>

<p>
Feminist philosophy of science and eco-feminist commentaries have
described how militarized metaphors (e.g., &ldquo;attack,&rdquo;
&ldquo;defense,&rdquo; &ldquo;invader&rdquo;) instantiate the
boundary-making that organizes immune discourse. These critics counter
that such biological extrapolations to characterize Western societies
ignore the interdependence, situated embodiment, and practices of care
that are required for social organization (Haraway 1989; Sontag 1990;
Martin 1994). A complementary critique within historiography of
immunology suggests that militaristic metaphors have functioned not
merely as pedagogical devices but have served to construct immunity as
a unified &ldquo;defense system&rdquo; (Da&euml;ron 2025). This
framing was reinforced by early twentieth-century European nationalism
and a misreading of the Darwinian concept of &ldquo;struggle&rdquo;.
Countering the autonomous model of immunity, the authors cite
symbiotic exchanges and the tolerance of myriad assimilated foreign
materials to challenge the origin and cultural resonance of the
atomistic framework. Recent philosophical comment extends this
integrative orientation by examining how immunity functions as an
organizing concept for thinking about identity, boundaries, and
protection across multiple social scales &mdash; from individual
bodies to political communities &mdash; revealing the inherent
tensions between autonomy and relationality in both biological and
social systems (Tauber 2016).</p>

<p>
Scholars argue that the autonomy models in immunology mirror broader
preoccupations with selfhood, autonomy, and exclusion in modern
societies, suggesting connections between immunological discourse and
contemporary political debates about borders, national identity, and
citizenship may follow ideological positions (Tauber 1995). In this
view, the language of immunity privileges individuality over community
and presents foreignness through conflict, while alternative accounts
highlight permeability, exchange, and accommodation (Napier 2003).
This interdisciplinary scholarship explores the circulation of
biological concepts in non-biological contexts and their potential
effects on policy and public understanding. Through this lens,
&ldquo;immunity&rdquo; becomes a central concept for organizing
thinking about protective barriers across various levels of social
systems, from individual identity formation to large-scale political
agendas and ideological programs (Sloterdijk 2011; Esposito 2011).</p>

<p>
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the conceptual framework of
immunological discourse gained renewed relevance and came under
intense scrutiny as this crisis brought immunology&rsquo;s language
into public consciousness. Despite evidence favoring balanced and
tailored approaches in clinical contexts, public discourse often
emphasized defensive warfare metaphors, e.g., strength and resilience,
potentially overshadowing more nuanced strategies (Zach and Greslehner
2023). Furthermore, the prevalent use of military jargon in public
dialogue not only influenced societal perceptions but may have also
guided health decision-making (Chatti 2021). While the impact of a
military orientation remains in debate, equating a pandemic with
warfare through such metaphors risks oversimplifying the complexities
of public health challenges and thereby unintentionally driving
fear-based responses and aggressive tactics over subtler and
potentially more effective measures (Chatti 2021; Benzi and Novarese
2022). These concerns highlight the pitfalls of using metaphorical
language in the life sciences and caution against the casual
employment of such figurative jargon (Reynolds 2022). When
interpretations oversimplify complex scientific realities, they may
not align with the best scientific evidence or public health
practices. Some argue that the defensive framework of immunology
should be reconsidered and adjusted for more accurate and holistic
representations, to better guide scientific research and fostering
public trust, rather than inciting fear or resistance (Ajana 2021;
2022).</p>

<p>
The divergent applications of social descriptions to immunology reveal
how the science may be employed for culture criticism and, by
extension, influence public policy and perceptions of disease. The
imagery borrowed from culture becomes transformed through scientific
discourse and returns to impact portrayals of persons and their
relationships (Martin 1994). This illustrates how immunology provides
metaphors for characterizing human societies, while the science draws
from its supporting culture to model its biology, demonstrating the
bi-directionality of social and scientific discourses (Gieryn 1995).
This resonance between science and culture is perhaps nowhere more
evident than in debates about vaccination, where individual freedoms
and collective health intersect (Brown 2018; Lau 2023). The dual
notions of immunity and security offer a framework to explore this
co-production of knowledge and social order, as the language of
biosecurity extends beyond scientific contexts to shape political
visions of threat, governance, and belonging (Napier 2003; Neocleous
2022). Scientific and cultural notions of immunity are thus deeply
intertwined, shaping policies and perceptions that impact both
individual freedoms and collective wellbeing.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">8. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Contemporary immunology encompasses diverse theoretical frameworks
that draw from multiple life sciences and thus offers a rich source of
inquiry for philosophers of biology. The field has been shaped by
several major theoretical contributions, including self/nonself model,
network theories, and more recently, discontinuity theory, each
offering different perspectives on immune identity and function. While
classical immune models emphasized the self/nonself dichotomy that
depicts the immune response as a simple &ldquo;on&rdquo; and
&ldquo;off&rdquo; binary switch, alternative models employ
collectivist, relational and interactive relationships that take into
account the context in which immune reactions are regulated. These
various approaches focus on accounting for the frequency and intensity
of an immune encounter as opposed to defining a simpler mechanical
structure/function interaction. This dynamic perspective emphasizes
that modulated responses better characterize immune functions, some of
which require tolerance of recognized substances and others full
activation of rejection.</p>

<p>
According to ecological approaches, the incorporation of the
contextual setting of immune reactivity demands an environmental (both
internal and external) perspective. These approaches join alternative
models in the literature (e.g., network and discontinuity accounts) to
qualify, and in some cases challenge, insular conceptions of the
organism by suggesting a dynamic interactive view that highlights how
life experience alters the immune response to myriad challenges and
opportunities (Pradeu 2012; 2019a; Grignolio et al 2014). From this
vantage, immunity has been described as extending beyond defense of an
atomistic individual to include the regulation of the organism&rsquo;s
ecological interactions. This includes the internal environment as
well, inasmuch as the microbiome, established through immune niche
formation, has directed attention toward the prevalence of immune
tolerance, symbiosis, and the biology characterized by cooperative
relationships of various sorts (Eberl 2010; Bilate and LaFaille 2012).
These perspectives suggest that understanding the balance of defensive
and assimilative processes may provide a more comprehensive conception
of immunity.</p>

<p>
In conclusion, philosophy of immunology is emerging as an area of
inquiry with its own subjects of attention and methods that complement
rather than mimic or replicate the pursuits in related areas of
theoretical and experimental immunology. While the literature remains
relatively small compared to other areas of philosophy of biology, the
field has produced significant contributions to philosophical
understanding. Philosophical studies of immunology have engaged with a
range of topics central to philosophy of biology &ndash; organismal
identity; individuality; dynamic causation in complex systems
(integrating complexity theory with big data studies); the
characterization of the goals and methods of systems biology; the
organization of information; the characterization of the normative and
deviant; and personal ontology (self). These inquiries connect to
other biological disciplines of interest to philosophers, i.e.,
development, ecology, genetics, evolution and cognition. And beyond
the purview of philosophy of biology, studies of immunology contribute
to the more general discussions of reductionism/holism, theory change
and conceptual modeling, and social and cultural studies of science
(i.e., the function of metaphors in science, the role of a scientific
discourse). In sum, a rich two-way traffic between philosophers of
immunology and philosophers of science has emerged that allows the
former to use tried-and-tested conceptual tools developed by their
colleagues, while providing a unique outlook for the latter. Given the
centrality of immunology in modern biology and the unique perspective
offered by this science on crucial philosophical problems, further
engagement not only seems likely, but an imperative for philosophy of
science writ large.</p>
