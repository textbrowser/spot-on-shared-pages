<h1>Animal Social Cognition</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Dec 5, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Nonhuman animals have long been seen as a crucial source of evidence
regarding the nature and origins of human social capacities, such as
communication, deception, culture, technology, politics, and morality.
Humans distinctively excel at these forms of sociality, which led
theorists in many disciplines to hypothesize that humans possess
unique adaptations facilitating advanced social cognition. Many of
these social activities presume an ability to attribute mental states
such as perceptions, beliefs, and desires to other social agents,
which might suggest that humans uniquely evolved a &ldquo;theory of
mind&rdquo; that enables these attributions. At the same time,
theorists have long appreciated that many animals also have complex
social lives and social abilities, and that humans and some current
animals evolved from a common ancestor which likely possessed
precursors to our cognitive abilities. This appreciation led to
decades of intense research into whether any animals also have a
theory of mind&mdash;a question which quickly proved difficult to
answer, for a variety of scientific and philosophical reasons reviewed
below. Many important philosophical positions also have a stake in the
outcome of this research, such as the Gricean theory of meaning and
communication, theories of intentional action, the nature of thought
and rationality, and&mdash;because these issues have implications for
things like rational agency and moral worth&mdash;views on the moral
and political status of animals.</p>

<p>
The scientific study of social cognition in animals has thus long been
of interest to philosophers&mdash;who have in turn contributed to
scientific debates, especially by proposing new experimental designs
to address evidential, conceptual, and methodological challenges
arising from within the empirical research. Two basic facts complicate
the study of animal social cognition:</p>

<ol>

<li>animal social cognition involves one cognitive agent interacting
with and perhaps representing the mental states of another cognitive
agent, increasing the complexity of any experimental design, and</li>

<li>any empirical study of such nonlinguistic social interactions and
mental representations must eschew reliance on language-based
instructions and subject reports used to interpret data in studies of
human social cognition.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As a result, complex debates over scientific method, epistemology of
science, philosophy of mind, and semantics collide in the
interpretation of key experiments, leading some philosophers and
scientists to despair over the possibility of any clear empirical
progress on core questions, especially regarding animal theory of
mind.</p>

<p>
This article will focus primarily on debates over theory of mind
(Premack &amp; Woodruff 1978) or &ldquo;mindreading&rdquo; (Krebs
&amp; Dawkins 1984; Whiten &amp; Byrne 1991) in animals, as this
topic&mdash;especially attributions of perceptual and epistemic states
such as <em>seeing</em> and <em>believing</em> in primates&mdash;has
captured the most attention in the philosophical literature on animal
social cognition. However, more recently the research agenda here has
broadened, following similar shifts in human developmental psychology,
to encompass a wider range of state attributions (such as desires or
intentions), a wider range of social interactions (such as play,
culture, shared intentionality, and norm-following), and a wider range
of animal taxa (such as insects, corvids, and dolphins). This entry
will review the basic history of scientific debates over animal theory
of mind (highlighting key contributions from philosophers), major
distinctions between types of views on animal theory of mind, core
philosophical questions and methodological problems that challenge the
interpretation of existing theory of mind experiments, and conclude by
exploring the broader spread of states and types of social
interactions in which philosophers are beginning to take greater
interest.</p>

<h2 id="HisTheMinNonHumAni">1. History: Theory of mind in non-human animals</h2>

<p>
From ancient debates to the twentieth century, philosophers and
scientists speculated and theorized about the social cognition of
animals, often in the context of evaluating animals&rsquo; moral
status. Porphyry (see <em>Four Books on Abstinence from Animal
Food</em>), for example, reviewed centuries of arguments appealing to
the social abilities of various animals in ancient debates over the
moral status of animals, and empiricists like Hume (1739) and Darwin
(1871) described animals&rsquo; social instincts as simpler versions
of the social passions and moral emotions in humans. Other theorists
such as Chance &amp; Mead (1953), Jolly (1966), and Humphrey (1976)
had proposed that the cognitive demands of social competition (such as
deception and maintaining alliances) would be a primary driver of the
evolution of intelligence in primates, which led to special focus on
the social organization of humans&rsquo; closest ancestors like
chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>

<p>
By the standard&rsquo;s of today&rsquo;s comparative psychology, much
of this theorizing looks informal and anecdotal (though observational
methods remain standard in primatology and anthropology); for present
purposes, the systematic experimental study of social cognition in
animals can be traced to an influential article published in
<em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em> in 1978 by the primatologists
David Premack and Guy Woodruff, entitled &ldquo;Does the chimpanzee
have a theory of mind?&rdquo;. This article opened with the idea that
&ldquo;theory of mind&rdquo; would be the primary target of its
experimental investigations, and that theory of mind involves the
ability of agents to &ldquo;impute mental states&rdquo; to themselves
and others. It also introduced other key assumptions of later work,
such as that the faculty would be theory-like because imputed mental
states were not directly observable in behavior, and that the primary
function of theory of mind was to predict the behavior of others. The
original list of mental states to be attributed included
&ldquo;intention, as well as knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt,
guessing, pretending, liking, and so on&rdquo;, but a trio of
philosophical commentators all independently recommended special
emphasis on epistemic states like belief&mdash;in particular, false
beliefs.</p>

<p>
Specifically, Dennett (1978), Bennett (1978), and Harman (1978) each
expressed concern that any behavioral evidence researchers might
collect which suggested that animals could attribute states like
perceptions, intentions, or knowledge would be conflated with evidence
that the attributing animal itself had those same perceptions,
intentions, or knowledge. Whenever two animals share the same mental
states, then the attributor could simply reason over its own mental
states, which would lead to the same predictions without any need to
attribute those mental states to another. Worse from the perspective
of a fledgling comparative psychology eager to legitimize its approach
to skeptical behaviorists, true mental states would often be based on
observed evidence for those states (e.g., observing a food item being
placed in a certain container), which could serve as associative cues
that lead animals to the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; solution in an
experiment through classical or instrumental conditioning. As is
common in comparative cognition research, an explanation of observed
behavior in terms of associative cues would be seen to undermine a
cognitive, representational interpretation of the data (an approach
described and critiqued at more length in Andrews &amp; Mons&oacute;
2021). Premack and Woodruff (1978) had tried to develop analogues of
linguistic cues in chimpanzees that could play the role of verbal
reports in children, but any signals produced by chimpanzees remained
confounded by associative explanations, as the animals had to be
trained to use such signals before they could be assessed in
experiments. Indeed, the history of this area reflects the hunt for
cues that could be assessed in experiments to reveal an animal&rsquo;s
understanding of another agent&rsquo;s mental state, but without being
subject to deflationary explanation in terms of associative
confounds.</p>

<p>
For example, if a chimpanzee wants to know whether some visually
obscured food is safe to grab when competing with a hostile
conspecific (i.e., member of the same species), when both animals know
the food&rsquo;s true location, then the attributor can simply predict
its competitor&rsquo;s behavior by generalizing from its own knowledge
states or past associations. To provide strong evidence that animals
actually attributed mental states to others, Bennett, Dennett, and
Harman argued, there must be a divergence between the mental states of
the attributing animal and the animal to which the mental state was
imputed. If perceptions and knowledge are both factive, then it would
be very difficult to find the needed distance; and non-factive
motivational states like intentions would often be shared by
competitors (e.g., to grab the same food item or to mate with the same
conspecific). Beliefs, however, can be false, and thus allow agents
represent others as taking the world to be in a different state of
affairs than they do.  This led to the development of the &ldquo;false
belief&rdquo; test, which has come to serve a crucial role in human
developmental psychology (now being seen as a milestone that human
children clear around the ages of 4&ndash;6 years old&mdash;[Wellman,
Cross, &amp; Watson 2001]) and for decades served as the primary
target of research in animal social cognition
research. Dennett&rsquo;s recommended version of the task, for
example, had chimpanzees observing an Experimenter (<em>E</em>) using
a key to access a &ldquo;banana locker&rdquo; which holds desired food
items. The chimpanzees observe
<em>E</em> leaving the key in Box <em>A</em>, but the chimpanzees are
allowed to observe another agent, &ldquo;Sneaky Pete&rdquo;, moving
the key to another Box <em>B</em>. <em>E</em> then returns, and if the
chimpanzees can attribute mental states, they should expect <em>E</em>
to look for the key in Box <em>A</em>, even though they now know it to
be in Box <em>B</em>. The initial difficulty was to find a way for the
chimpanzees to signal that they had such an expectation that diverged
from their own knowledge. This kind of task eventually evolved into
the famous &ldquo;Sally-Anne test&rdquo; of false belief that is so
frequently deployed on human children, who can simply express this
expectation in words when asked (Wimmer &amp; Perner 1983).</p>

<p>
A variety of experimenters continued to explore the edges of this
initial conceptual difficulty, with mixed results. Premack (1988)
later divided Theory of Mind up into three classes, perceptual ToM
(seeing, hearing, and attention), motivational ToM (intending,
wanting, liking), and epistemic ToM (knowledge and beliefs). In
particular, Daniel Povinelli began his career as an enthusiast of
chimpanzee theory of mind (Povinelli, Nelson, &amp; Boysen 1990), but,
after thoroughly investigating forms of instability in the
experimental evidence for perceptual theory of mind in chimpanzees,
became one of its most ardent skeptics. Povinelli and Eddy (1996)
tried to overcome the initial difficulty of an unambiguous
nonlinguistic signal for what the chimpanzees understood about other
minds by using a series of experimental designs which gave chimpanzees
a choice between two different experimenters from which to beg for
food items. In these &ldquo;knower-guesser&rdquo; designs, the two
experimenters would have different mental states (e.g., one can see
the food and another not, one knows where the food is and the other
does not), and the chimpanzee was given a choice to beg from one
experimenter or the other. The chimpanzee&rsquo;s choice of the
experimenter from which to beg, they reasoned, should demonstrate
whether it can impute those states to the experimenters reliably. The
difference between the knower and the guesser, from the
chimpanzees&rsquo; perspective, was evidenced by differences in gaze
cues, such as experimenters with their backs turned, blindfolds,
buckets, and tinted goggles.</p>

<p>
While chimpanzees in Povinelli and Eddy&rsquo;s experiments
demonstrated some sensitivity to gaze cues, such as not begging from
experimenters with their backs turned, they failed to demonstrate
robust understanding of the perceptual significance of gaze in other
cases, such as by begging from experimenters with opaque buckets over
their heads whose visual access to food items was equally occluded.
Age matched children (2&ndash;5 year old) passed the same tasks,
leading Povinelli and Eddy to conclude that chimpanzees&rsquo;
understanding of gaze cues was shallow and that even perceptual theory
of mind is likely uniquely human. Proponents of animal theory of mind
rebutted these findings on a wide variety of grounds, by arguing that
the experiments were ecologically invalid because chimpanzees more
commonly compete rather than cooperate for food, had to be trained to
use the begging cues, might not have understood that humans cannot see
through buckets and blindfolds, and/or might perform better in more
ecologically-enriched environments (Bard et al. 2021; Bulloch, Boysen,
&amp; Furlong 2008; Emery &amp; Clayton 2009; Krupenye 2021).</p>

<p>
The next major breakthrough in this area arrived via a series of
experiments conducted by Brian Hare, Josep Call, Bryan Agnetta, and
Michael Tomasello (2000). They devised an experimental paradigm
involving two chimpanzees, a subordinate and a dominant, being placed
across from one another in a shared enclosure which contained opaque
occluders that blocked gaze. The chimpanzees were held behind
guillotine doors that could be raised or lowered by experimenters, and
food items could be placed either out in the open or behind an opaque
occluder from the perspective of the dominant. The guillotine doors
were then raised, with the subordinate given a small head start, and
the experimenters assessed whether the subordinates were more likely
to take food items that were behind occluders from the perspective of
the dominant than those that were out in the open, which is just what
the subordinates reliably did across a range of experimental
conditions. As a result, these authors strongly endorsed the claim
that chimpanzees have at least a perceptual theory of mind that allows
them to know what others do and do not see. This result led to a
resurgence of interest in animal theory of mind after a wave of
pessimism in the late 1990s&mdash;though this interest quickly led to
an interpretive impasse.</p>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span>: The Hare et al. (2000) design. Two
chimpanzees are allowed to pursue food items in a shared enclosure.
Food items are either out in the open from the perspective of the
dominant, or behind an opaque occluder from the perspective of the
dominant. If the subordinate attempts to take food items that are
behind opaque occluders more often than those that are out in the
open, the experimenters argue this would provide evidence that they
understand what the dominant can and cannot see.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="LogProResAniTheMin">2. The &ldquo;logical problem&rdquo; with research on animal theory of mind</h2>

<p>
Hare et al.&rsquo;s experiments&mdash;as well as many others like it
conducted in other species like monkeys, ravens, corvids, and dogs
(for a systematic review, see Lurz 2011)&mdash;were soon subjected to
a conceptual critique that has come to be called the &ldquo;logical
problem&rdquo;. The logical problem highlights a concern that previous
experiments for animal perceptual theory of mind necessarily conflate
behavioral evidence that an animal represents a conspecific&rsquo;s
perceptual states (such as seeing) with behavioral evidence that they
represent the observable cues indicating that mental state, such as
line-of-gaze. Povinelli and other skeptics argued that in these
experiments, the chimpanzees could only infer the contents of a
competitor&rsquo;s visual perceptual states if they had observable
behavioral cues as to where they were looking. The most common
confounds were so-called &ldquo;line-of-gaze cues&rdquo;, such as the
direction of the other agent&rsquo;s head or eyes. The computation of
line-of-gaze is thought to be more complex than merely observing the
animal&rsquo;s eyes or face, as line-of-gaze includes a spatial line
originating at the surface of the other agent&rsquo;s eyes or head and
terminating in a target object or an opaque occluder. Heyes similarly
concedes that chimpanzees can &ldquo;accurately anticipate the
goal-directed behavior of an agent who held a false belief&rdquo;, but
she insists that existing experiments merely show evidence for
&ldquo;submentalizing&rdquo;, which involves &ldquo;prediction of
behavior by low-level, domain-general psychological processes&rdquo;
(Heyes 2017: 1). While Penn and Povinelli (2007) admit that tracking
line-of-gaze across all control conditions is cognitively
sophisticated, they insist that it is merely
&ldquo;behavior-reading&rdquo;&mdash;which is to be contrasted with
human-like theory of mind or mindreading because the
chimpanzees&rsquo; ability relies only on tracking &ldquo;behavioral,
rather than mental, intervening variables&rdquo; (2007: 737). Some
skeptical philosophers, most especially Robert Lurz (2011), have
argued that both the psychology and philosophy of perception suggest
that animals track such complex cue combinations as part of their
routine comprehension of their environment; but others have argued
that such computations would be as cognitively demanding as theory of
mind itself (Buckner 2014).</p>

<p>
Typically, skeptics who defend the logical problem such as Heyes
(1998), Penn and Povinelli (2007), and Lurz (2009) offer their own
version of an experiment that they believe can in principle overcome
their skeptical challenges, in order to obviate the charge that their
evidential standard is so stringent as to be empirically
unsatisfiable. However, other skeptics have often argued that these
increasingly complex designs are also undermined by the logical
problem, sometimes before the experiments had even been performed.
This led research in this area to reach a kind of conceptual and
methodological impasse (Call &amp; Tomasello 2008; Penn, Holyoak,
&amp; Povinelli 2008). This impasse encouraged a variety of
psychologists and philosophers to suggest that some of the basic
assumptions of the research tradition needed to be revised in order to
achieve empirical progress&mdash;such as ideas about theoretical
parsimony (Clatterbuck 2015; Dacey 2016; Halina 2015; Heyes 1998;
Sober 2015), null hypothesis testing (Andrews &amp; Huss 2014; Meketa
2014; Mikhalevich 2015; Mikhalevich, Powell, &amp; Logan 2017),
implicit theory of representation (Buckner 2014; Phillips 2019), and
more general epistemology of science (Fagan 2016; Fitzpatrick 2009).
Others have offered alternative interpretations of the cognitive
abilities that these designs could or should assess in animals
(Andrews 2012; Burge 2018; Nanay 2020). Recent successes by simple
artificial neural networks on nonlinguistic false-belief-attribution
designs might further call into question the idea that such tests
could only be passed with a concept of belief, as these systems lack
much of the cognitive architecture presumed to be shared between
humans and animals, yet they can pass some of the more demanding
theory of mind tasks (Rabinowitz et al. 2018&mdash;Other Internet
Resources).</p>

<p>
One of the first experimental designs proposed by the skeptics to
overcome the logical problem was the &ldquo;goggles&rdquo; design
sketched by Heyes (1998). The innovation of the goggles design was to
provide animals with a learned, observable cue that could track the
internal experience of a conspecific. Chimpanzees were to learn from
their own experience that one kind of goggles with translucent lenses
afforded sight, whereas another kind had opaque lenses that did not
afford sight; from a distance, however, the goggles could be
distinguished only by the color of their frames. As a result, subjects
must learn from their own experience which color afforded sight, and
then they would need to &ldquo;project&rdquo; this perceptual access
onto a conspecific after observing the color of the goggles they are
wearing. While there have not been exact implementations of the
goggles design reported, eventually some experimenters published
studies operating on similar logic. Karg et al. (2015) implemented a
version on chimpanzees using colored boxes instead of goggles, and
Bugnyar, Reber, and Buckner (2016) implemented a design on ravens
using peepholes between enclosures. Both of these experiments reported
positive results. While admitting that these experiments demonstrated
a new degree of flexibility in responding to the mental states of
others, some skeptics still did not concede that these designs had
fully overcome the logical problem (Kuznar et al. 2020; Lurz 2018).
Lurz has recommended the use of mirrors to overcome the logical
problem, and has collaborated on other experiments reporting positive
results (Lurz &amp; Krachun 2019). Some of the most devout skeptics
however, remain unconvinced, finding residual logical problems with
even these most elaborate designs (Burge 2018; Heyes 2017; Lurz &amp;
Krachun 2019; Povinelli 2020), and Andrews (2005) argued early on that
the goggles design was vulnerable to alternative interpretation in
terms of &ldquo;ability to do things&rdquo; when certain goggles or
buckets are present, rather than the standard line-of-gaze
interpretation.</p>

<p>
Despite this impasse, new research continues to be conducted on false
belief attribution in animals. In particular, Krupenye, Kano, et al.
(2016) adapted eye-tracking methods from infant cognition to provide
evidence that chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans can anticipate that
others will act according to false beliefs. While many experimenters
had considered applying a version of the canonical Sally-Anne test to
animals, it had been difficult to find a non-linguistic analogue that
could be applied to apes. Onishi and Baillargeon (2005) developed
variant of the Sally-Anne task for nonverbal human infants which used
eye-tracking rather than verbal reports to study false belief
attributions, but it was also difficult for practical reasons and
conceptual reasons to apply eye-tracking methods to apes. Krupenye,
Kano, et al. (2016) confronted both challenges by developing a more
competitive eye-tracking design in which a human actor wears a gorilla
costume (&ldquo;King Kong&rdquo;). Apes watched videos in which a
plainclothes human would enter a scene with two haystacks in which
King Kong could hide; when the human turned his back, King Kong would
hit him on the back and hide in a haystack. The human would then leave
the scene via a door to go retrieve a long pole that could be used to
beat the haystacks. In various conditions, King Kong would move around
in the haystacks, either in or outside of the view of the human he had
attacked, and then exit the scene entirely. The experimenters would
then monitor the observing apes&rsquo; gaze locations to see whether
they anticipated the human first whacking the haystack where King Kong
was last located (and seen by the observing ape), or where the human
last observed him to be located. A second version of the experiment
was also conducted with a stone and two box location in which it could
be hidden. When data across the two experiments was pooled, a
significant trend of looking towards the target location predicted by
the observing human&rsquo;s false belief was reported across two types
of false belief conditions which was taken as evidence that the apes
possess some ability to attribute a false belief.</p>

<p>
Krupenye et al.&rsquo;s experiments were explicitly designed to
replicate the logic of looking-times studies for false belief
attribution in 2-year-old infants, especially Southgate, Senju, and
Csibra (2007); it is thus difficult to attribute theory of mind to
human infants on the basis of such anticipatory looking, while denying
it to apes. Nevertheless, several looking-times studies on infant
theory of mind have recently come under criticism in developmental
psychology on the basis of replication failures (Kampis et al. 2021;
Kulke et al. 2018; L. Powell et al. 2018; ManyBabies Consortium 2020).
Those unconvinced by the early infant looking-times experiments will
likely also look with skepticism upon similar experimental results
collected with apes. Indeed, several prominent theorists have
suggested that while these studies demonstrate significant flexibility
in tracking belief-like states, they can be explained in terms of
abilities which show less than a full understanding of propositional
theory of mind (Andrews 2018; Heyes 2017; Tomasello 2018).</p>

<h2 id="UndDisOveAniToMBasDis">3. Understanding the disagreement over animal ToM: Basic distinctions</h2>

<p>
As noted above, philosophers have been intensely interested in these
disagreements, as they reflect cases where scientists seem to agree on
all of the data but disagree on their interpretation. We may begin
with a series of distinctions that could be used to organize
theoretical positions on these data, as much of the philosophical work
on these debates has called into questioned the basic distinctions or
assumptions of the empirical research. These include the structure of
animal social cognition (is it theory-like or not?), the unity of the
purported capacity (is it a single system, a hybrid system, or
multiple special-purpose systems?), and the evolutionary origins of
the system (did it emerge once in human ancestors, or has it emerged
multiple times in different socially complex phylogenetic
groups?).</p>

<h3 id="StrTheTheSimBot">3.1 Structure of the theory: theory, simulation, or both</h3>

<p>
One fundamental issue in the empirical study of animal social
cognition concerns the organizing structure of the capacity. In the
philosophy and science of human social cognition, there has been a
longstanding debate about the structure of &ldquo;folk
psychology&rdquo; and our own social cognitive capacities. So-called
&ldquo;theory theorists&rdquo; (cf. Hutto &amp; Ravenscroft 2021,
entry on
 <a href="../folkpsych-theory/">folk psychology as a theory</a>)
 hold that human social cognitive capacities are
theory-like&mdash;that is, they operate like a simple scientific
theory, positing unobservable, causally-efficacious states that stand
in law-like relationships to one another. On this framework, the
difference between empirical psychology and folk psychology is one of
degree or sophistication rather than of kind. Another camp, the
so-called &ldquo;simulation theorists&rdquo; (cf. Barlassina &amp;
Gordon 2017, entry on
 <a href="../folkpsych-simulation/">folk psychology as mental simulation</a>),
 hold that the structure of social cognition in humans is not
theory-like, but rather based on our own capacities for mental
imagery, imaginative projection, and simulation. We simply plug in
different inputs to systems in us which allow us to simulate our own
perceptions or form plans on the basis of beliefs and desires, and
attribute the result of this simulation to other agents. Since both of
these approaches already have entries dedicated to them, this entry
need not go into them in more detail here; suffice it to say that such
debates can be reprised in the context of animal social cognition.
Other relevant positions have been defended as well, such as the idea
that animal social cognition is theory-like but implicit, akin to
tacit or na&iuml;ve physics (Kaiser, Jonides, &amp; Alexander 1986),
that humans and animals can directly perceive the mental states of
others (Gallagher 2001), or that social cognition is less about
predicting behavior and more about influencing one another&rsquo;s
psychology (Zawidzki 2013) or explaining one another&rsquo;s behavior
(Andrews 2005, 2012). Others have also offered hybrid positions, with
both theory-like and simulation-like elements (Spaulding 2018). Today,
hybrid or pluralistic theories tend to be the most
empirically-successful in human psychology, as no monolithic form of
theory has been able to explain the full range of experimental data in
human social psychology.</p>

<p>
One&rsquo;s position on the structure of human social cognition will
obviously carry implications for one&rsquo;s views on whether animals
have specific forms of social cognition, such as theory of mind.
Notably, the more explicit and theory-like aspects of social cognition
are perhaps much less plausibly possessed in non-linguistic animals,
who lack the words to learn, describe, and manipulate the components
of an explicit theory of mental states. Researchers who think
theory-like components form the core or essential aspects of human
social cognition will doubt that nonhuman animals possess anything
relevant, even when they are capable of flexibly responding in an
adaptive matter to a variety of social cues and situations.
Conversely, researchers who hold deflationary views about the
structure of human social cognition will be more likely to see
relevant analogues and precursors in animals. In comparative social
cognition research, therefore, explicitly describing assumptions about
the nature of human social cognition may lead to more productive
debates.</p>

<h3 id="StrVieOneLevMulSys">3.2 Structure of the view: One level or multiple systems</h3>

<p>
Relatedly, theorists have speculated that there might be at least two
different mindreading systems in humans which can operate
independently or in concert, and perhaps only the first system is
shared with animals. Apperly and Butterfill (2009) in particular
suggest that there might be a &ldquo;minimal theory of mind&rdquo;
system which is shared at least amongst humans, primates, and corvids,
and then a second more theory-like system which is uniquely human. The
minimal theory of mind system is based upon the idea of
&ldquo;registrations&rdquo;, which are combinations of gaze cues,
objects, and locations that are recorded by an observing animals
(Butterfill &amp; Apperly 2013). Registrations are belief-like in that
they allow animals to monitor relations between particular agents and
the status of particular objects in particular locations. For example,
if one animal observes another to have a line-of-gaze to a food item
in some location at some time, it records that animal to have
registered that object in that location. If the object is later moved
outside of that registering animals&rsquo; gaze, the representation of
registration may allow the observing animal to demonstrate surprise
should the observed animal look for the object in its new location as
opposed to where it was previously registered&mdash;thus passing some
versions of the nonverbal false belief task. They argue nevertheless
that minimal theory of mind lacks certain capabilities of full
propositional theory of mind as possessed by humans, such as the
ability to represent different appearances or aspects of registered
objects, or to iterate propositional attitude ascriptions to higher
orders (e.g., &ldquo;I believe that you know that the object appears
red&rdquo;). As with &ldquo;dual system&rdquo; theories in other
areas, the minimal theory of mind system is more implicit and
perceptual, perhaps being more automatic and less effortful in its
operations, and full theory-of-mind may be more explicit in its
operations and require more cognitive effort and attention.</p>

<p>
Another kind of hybrid view is based upon the idea that there are
forms of theory of mind which depend upon online interaction with
other agents. On this view, in addition to theoretical or simulative
forms of &ldquo;off-line&rdquo; mindreading, there are forms of
mindreading which are essentially embodied and based in interpersonal
pragmatics and online second-person interactions (Gallagher 2001).
These views often emphasize imitation and enactive perception as basic
precursors of second-person mindreading. In the case of imitation, for
example, it may be that online observation, comparison, and effortless
proprioceptive understanding of another&rsquo;s actions allows us to
imitate one another without any deeper theoretical or simulative
understanding of the others&rsquo; actions. Enactive perception of
bodily movements and facial expressions may allow us to track
another&rsquo;s goals and intentions in a particular situation in an
egocentric and context-bound manner without require any heavy-duty
representation of the others&rsquo; mental states. Using such
mechanisms, animals might be &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; to one another in an
embodied interaction in a way that produces behavior which is adaptive
in light of one another&rsquo;s mental states, but that does not
reflect any deeper theoretical understanding of those mental states in
a context-independent way (Gallagher &amp; Povinelli 2012).</p>

<h3 id="ShaDesConEvo">3.3 Shared descent or convergent evolution?</h3>

<p>
Another major issue in the study of animal social cognition concerns
the question of whether social cognitive capacities should be expected
to have emerged only once in the hominid lineage, or whether
capacities might have independently evolved several times in different
socially-complex animal species (Sober 2005). One&rsquo;s views on
these issues are often interrelated with those others just discussed.
For example, researchers who have a restrictive view of theory of mind
as a single, theory-like capacity may hold that theory of mind evolved
only once in a hominid ancestor once they diverged from a common line
with chimpanzees and bonobos. Theorists who adopt a hybrid view like
Apperly and Butterfill may suppose that this view is correct for the
theory-like form of theory of mind, but that minimal theory of mind
might have evolved multiple times in different taxa. Those with more
multifarious or pluralistic views can investigate the spread of many
different components and capacities throughout the animal kingdom.
Social cognition experiments have been conducted on chimpanzees,
bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, capuchins, macaques, rhesus monkeys,
tamarins, marmosets, rats, horses, sheep, pigs, dogs, foxes, wolves,
scrub jays, ravens, parrots, dolphins, seals, cichlids, wrasses,
sticklebacks, bees, ants, and many more. With all this data across the
animal kingdom, we can begin to develop a broader picture of the
pressures favoring the evolution and development of many different
components of social cognition, which may in turn inform a deeper
understanding of the practical implications of social cognitive
capacities across many different animal groups, for example for
welfare decisions (Nawroth et al. 2019).</p>

<h2 id="CauToMImpPhiDia">4. Causes of the ToM impasse: Philosophical diagnoses</h2>

<p>
Despite the wealth of experimental data now available on the social
cognitive abilities of animals, there remains a large degree of
disagreement on the best way to interpret these data. Moreover, it has
not always been clear how further experimental work could resolve
these disagreements; proponents and skeptics of animal social
cognition would likely disagree about the correct interpretation of
future, more powerful experiments as well. This has led many
philosophers and psychologists to conclude that deeper philosophical
or methodological disagreements must be resolved before empirical
progress can be made on animal social cognition. This section
considers some of the suggestions that have been raised in this
vein.</p>

<h3 id="ComBia">4.1 Comparative bias</h3>

<p>
One of the most common concerns expressed in the reflections on the
methodology of comparative psychology concerns the charge of
anthropomorphic bias. Skeptics who argue that animals are merely
capable of associative learning, behavior-reading, or sub-mentalizing
argue that proponents of animal theory of mind or mindreading are
overinterpreting their data because they are anthropomorphizing their
research subjects. Povinelli and Vonk (2003) even argue that
anthropomorphism and theory of mind are closely linked: because humans
have a unique ability to reinterpret behavioral abstractions in terms
of mental states, we cannot help but interpret animal social behavior
except by imputing those same mental states to them. Proponents have
responded that refusing to interpret similar behavior in terms of
similar causes risks a bias in the other direction, dubbed
anthropodenial or anthropectomy (Andrews &amp; Huss 2014; De Waal
1999; Sober 2005). Buckner (2013) has further countered that skeptics
may be committing a bias dubbed &ldquo;anthropofabulation&rdquo;,
which combines anthropocentrism with confabulation about human
prowess. Specifically, anthropofabulation occurs when researchers set
the criteria for the possession of some capacity to an overly
idealized view of human capacity, a bar so high that not even humans
would clear them if fairly assessed. For example, some presentations
of the logical problem require that &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; theory of
mind or mindreading be independent of any particular capacities for
tracking proximal cues or behavior-reading, when humans&mdash;assumed
to lack psychic powers allowing direct perceptual access to the mental
states of others&mdash;could also only infer mental states indirectly,
on the basis of behavioral evidence.</p>

<p>
Concerns about anthropomorphism are also often tied up with other
background issues in methodology, especially regarding the choice of
null hypothesis and whether it is more parsimonious to assume that our
nearest primate relatives would or would not share similar social
cognitive capacities. In many experiments in animal cognition, the
test conditions of an experiment are designed to rule out a null
hypothesis, which in many cases discussed above is that animals do not
have the same social cognitive capacities as humans (Andrews &amp;
Huss 2014). This has led some philosophers to recommend choosing more
empirically-informed null hypotheses in our experiments, whereas
others have pushed back by arguing that existing scientific practices
are sufficient to mitigate these concerns (Bausman &amp; Halina 2018;
Dacey 2023; Halina 2022; Mikhalevich 2015; Mikhalevich, Powell, &amp;
Logan 2017).</p>

<h3 id="ParMet">4.2. Parsimony Metrics</h3>

<p>
Relatedly, there has been intense debate regarding measures of
parsimony in interpreting data in experiments on animal social
cognition. It has long been a popular proposal in comparative
psychology that hypotheses which explain behavior in terms of
associative learning are more parsimonious than those that appeal to
cognitive processes. Penn &amp; Povinelli further suggest that while
behavior-reading may not be purely associative in nature,
behavior-reading hypotheses are still more parsimonious than
mind-reading hypotheses (Penn &amp; Povinelli 2007). The idea that
non-cognitive or behavior-reading explanations are more parsimonious
is often tied to Morgan&rsquo;s Canon and likened to a form of
Ockham&rsquo;s Razor for psychology, with the idea that
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; processes on the scale of psychological evolution
and development are more parsimonious explanations by default (Heyes
1998; Karin-D&rsquo;Arcy 2005; Sober 2005). However, it has often
proven difficult to justify the claim that associative or
behavior-reading hypotheses are always more parsimonious, especially
when many different rules or links must be posited without additional
empirical justification (Fitzpatrick 2008; Hanus 2016). For example,
Fletcher and Carruthers (2013) note that Penn and Povinelli (2007)
require at least nine different behavior-reading rules to explain the
full range of relevant behaviors observed in different social
cognition experiments on chimpanzees at the time, and more would need
to be added for experiments conducted since. Proponents of theory of
mind in animals counter that it is more parsimonious to explain many
different experiments by appeal to the same underlying mindreading
mechanism, especially when dealing with cognitively flexible animals
that share evolutionary lineages and evolutionary pressures with
humans (Call &amp; Tomasello 2008; Tomasello, Call, &amp; Hare 2003).
There are thus a wide range of proposed metrics of parsimony that have
been deployed by different authors in the literature, leading to a
great deal of talking past when arguing about theory of mind in
animals (Clatterbuck 2015, 2016; Dacey 2016; Fagan 2016; Sober
2015).</p>

<h3 id="LabConVsEcoVal">4.3 Laboratory control vs. ecological validity</h3>

<p>
Another source of contention in studies of social cognition in animals
concerns a tension between laboratory control required for
experimental designs, and giving animals ecologically valid situations
and cues where they are most likely to be able to manifest social
competences. Skeptics argue that giving animals ecologically valid
cues or testing them in natural environments makes it difficult or
impossible to rule out confounding hypotheses that subjects have
enjoyed some associative or statistical learning experience with the
relevant cues, and so it is impossible to rule out that the behavior
can be explained in terms of behavior-reading or submentalizing.
Proponents argue that there is little reason to believe that animals
could or should manifest social competences in artificial laboratory
settings which lack motivational significance to the animals. The most
prominent place where this concern has emerged in studies of animal
social cognition concerns the discrepancy between reliable failures on
Povinelli and Eddy&rsquo;s (1996) studies to assess whether
chimpanzees understand seeing, compared to Hare et al. (2000)&rsquo;s
later positive findings. As noted in the introduction, one of the most
popular explanations for these discrepancies is that Povinelli and
Eddy&rsquo;s tasks were mostly cooperative, whereas Hare et
al.&rsquo;s designs were competitive. Tomasello, Call, and Hare (2003)
argued that chimpanzees are naturally more competitive than
cooperative, and so they might have failed on Povinelli &amp;
Eddy&rsquo;s designs because they were ecologically invalid. Penn and
Povinelli rebut that focusing on ecologically-valid tasks risks
introducing confounds, as ecologically-valid cues are more likely to
have rigid innate mechanisms or be present in the animals&rsquo;
learning history prior to the experiment. These concerns have since
been discussed in a number of other social cognitive capacities and
species; for a recent review, see Krupenye and Call (2019).</p>

<p>
More thoroughly ecological approaches&mdash;conducting experiments in
the wild, on wild animals&mdash;have produced even more positive
results. While disappointing results were accumulating in lab-based
experiments on animal social cognition, cognitive ethologists such as
Carolyn Ristau were producing interesting results using entirely
different methods in the field. Ristau (1990), for example,
systematically explored the broken-wing display of piping plovers as
possible example of deception. Inspired in part by Dennett&rsquo;s
(1983) &ldquo;intentional systems theory&rdquo;, she argued that the
broken-wing display in plovers exhibited a degree of flexibility which
merited its description as at least first-order intentional creatures
in Dennett&rsquo;s framework, capable of representations of the form
&ldquo;<em>X</em> wants to lead <em>Y</em> away from the nest&rdquo;.
This second-order state, Ristau argued, was legitimated by the
flexibility demonstrated by the broken wing dance when tested. Rather
than being a rigidly defined reflex, the piping plover would make many
flexible adjustments to the location of its display. The plovers are a
ground-nesting bird, and as a predator approached the nest, the plover
would land in a direction that would draw the predator away from the
nest, generally in the visual field of the predator, and appeared to
make rapid adjustments to its location in response to changes of
location and direction by the predator. It would also adjust the
urgency and frequency of its display as the predator got closer to the
nest, and would cease the display and fly away once the predator was a
safe distance away from the nest. Ristau left open, however, whether
they merited description as a form of deception, which would construe
plovers as second-order intentional systems capable of states
involving theory-of-mind-like attributions such as &ldquo;<em>X</em>
wants <em>Y</em> to believe that it is injured&rdquo; (Bugnyar &amp;
Kotrschal 2004). The pattern of negative results in artificial
lab-based tasks and positive results in ecologically valid field-based
settings reflects a long-standing tension in animal cognition research
generally that is unlikely to resolve itself anytime soon.</p>

<h3 id="BioFunSocCog">4.4 The biological function of social cognition</h3>

<p>
Another set of explanations for discrepancies in findings and
interpretations of data on animal social cognition concerns the
purported function of theory of mind or mindreading capacities. As
noted in the introduction, many experiments are designed around the
assumption, common in primatology, that the primary function of social
cognitive capacities, especially in primates, is behavioral prediction
for the purposes of social competition. This general theory of primate
cognition has been dubbed the &ldquo;Machiavellian intelligence&rdquo;
hypothesis by defenders (Whiten and Byrne 1997), the idea being that a
general boom in the intelligence and theoretical reasoning abilities
of primates can be explained by a sudden increase in social complexity
and competition in our primate ancestors. Other theorists have argued
instead that for the purposes of behavioral prediction,
behavior-reading or submentalizing would suffice, and so mental state
attributions or other sophisticated social cognitive capacities must
serve other purposes. Andrews (2005) has argued that theory of mind
evolved primarily to serve purposes of explanation rather than
prediction, and so experiments should not focus exclusively on
behavioral prediction if seeking to find evidence for animal theory of
mind. Zawidzki (2013) has argued that advanced social cognitive
capacities play more of a role in social regulation than in prediction
or explanation, and so serve the function of
&ldquo;mindshaping&rdquo;, helping social agents regulate one
another&rsquo;s behaviors and hold each other to shared social norms.
This has in turn been applied to suggest further new directions in
experiments on the social cognitive abilities of primates
(Papadopoulos &amp; Andrews 2022) and further tied to theories about
the development of shared intentions and proto-normative behavior in
animals. Another interesting suggestion has been that processes of
domestication select for social cognitive capacities like
perspective-taking, based on comparisons between closely-related
domesticated and undomesticated species, such as dogs and wolves
(Mikl&oacute;si &amp; Top&aacute;l 2011). Given the diversity of
opinions regarding the purpose of social cognition in animals,
theorists should explicitly consider these issues before wading into
interpretive disagreements and proposing new experimental
paradigms.</p>

<h3 id="SigLim">4.5 Signature limits</h3>

<p>
Another recent proposal for arbitrating disagreements is that instead
of focusing on behavioral manifestations of success on social tasks as
evidence for theory of mind, we should look for &ldquo;signature
limits&rdquo; revealed by differing patterns of failures or rates of
acquisition in various situations. Butterfill and Apperly (2013)
emphasize that their hypothesized minimal theory of mind and
full-blown explicit theory of mind systems would predict similar
solutions to social problems in many experimental designs. However,
they argued that the two systems could be empirically distinguished by
their subtly different patterns of acquisition and failure across
tasks. Minimal theory of mind, they hypothesized, would rely on
representations of particular objects and relations to agents to make
predictions, and so would struggle with more abstract predictions
involving quantification and identity; for application of this idea to
the interpretation of a recent design, see (Kano et al. 2019; Taylor
et al. 2022). They thus recommend experimental designs that rely on
these more abstract forms of inference to distinguish the two
systems.</p>

<h3 id="TheRep">4.6 Theory of representation</h3>

<p>
Finally, Buckner (2014) has argued that that many of these other
dimensions of disagreement can be understood as disagreements over the
implicit theories of representation adopted by researchers
interpreting the data, and thus the impasse is most fundamentally a
&ldquo;semantic problem&rdquo;, rather than a logical one. It is
difficult to express the distinction between behavior-reading and
mind-reading, or between mentalizing and submentalizing, except in
representational terms: full theory of mind, mind-reading, or
mentalizing involves representing the mental states of others, whereas
behavior-reading or submentalizing involves representing only
contingencies or configurations of behavioral cues. These behavioral
cues are often good evidence for underlying mental states and are
statistically correlated with them to varying degrees (Heyes 2015).
Thus, the debate over animal social cognitive capacities turns on the
criteria for representing a distal mental state rather than merely its
proximal behavioral evidence. This kind of tension between a
representation of a distal state and of its proximal cues is common
from debates on the theory of representation in philosophy of mind
(Dretske 1986; Prinz 2000).</p>

<p>
Skeptics like Povinelli seem to require unsatisfiably restrictive
criteria for representation, such as that the representation of a
distal mental state depend upon no particular proximal behavioral
cues. Since neither humans nor animals are psychic, neither can
represent mental states except by tracking perceivable behavioral
evidence of those states. Yet it must also be admitted that there is a
real distinction between merely tracking behavioral evidence and
tracking the distal mental state. Some proponents of theory of mind in
animals seem to implicitly prefer teleosemantic theories of
representation, by emphasizing the evolutionary function of tracking
behavioral cues must appeal to the functional role that the
corresponding mental state (e.g., seeing) plays in the observed
agent&rsquo;s psychology. There are well-known concerns expressed
about such teleosemantic proposals in comparative psychology, however,
in that it can be difficult to empirically confirm or disconfirm such
attributions of function (Chater &amp; Heyes 1994). Buckner (2022) has
suggested that the issue can be rendered empirically tractable by
emphasizing an open-ended ability to flexibly recruit new proximal
cues as evidence for a distal mental state&mdash;a
&ldquo;forward-looking&rdquo; approach to mental representation that
correspondingly suggests new behavioral experiments. Phillips (2019)
tackles this challenge in a different way by proposing three different
accounts of representing &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; (the &ldquo;headlamp
conception&rdquo;, the &ldquo;stage lights&rdquo; conception, and
&ldquo;seeing-as&rdquo;) that can be used to interpret prior
experiments on perspective-taking and inspire new ones, and
Clatterbuck (2018) suggests that experimenters should develop explicit
causal models of various representational hypotheses before trying to
tease them apart with behavioral experiments.</p>

<h2 id="BroResSocCog">5. The broadening of research on social cognition</h2>

<p>
As the flashpoint debate over the logical problem failed to settle
into a consensus resolution, general trends&mdash;simultaneously
developing independently in human developmental social cognition
research&mdash;recommended a more expansive and pluralistic attitude
towards social cognition. Many researchers have suggested that the
logical problem caused &ldquo;tunnel vision&rdquo; that, while
facilitating fruitful interdisciplinary discussion between
psychologists and philosophers, led to neglect of other issues that
might be just as much or more important, both scientifically and
philosophically. In humans, this broadening has been recommended to
make sense of the complex pattern of behavior exhibited over
developmental timescales, where infants gradually develop
nonlinguistic forms of social cognition up to age 2, then tend to fail
more advanced verbal versions of social cognition tasks purportedly
involving the same attributions (e.g., of false beliefs), then start
reliably succeeding on both verbal and nonverbal versions around age 5
(Andrews, Spaulding, &amp; Westra 2021; Fiebich, Gallagher, &amp;
Hutto 2017; Westra 2017; Westra &amp; Carruthers 2017).</p>

<p>
The wider range of states explored in animal social cognition today
includes (at least) emotions, desires, social relationships, play,
culture, and other precursors of morality.</p>

<h3 id="EmoSta">5.1 Emotional states</h3>

<p>
Another important dimension of social cognition for animals would be
the tracking of one another&rsquo;s emotional states and moods, on the
assumption that many animals can possess at least primitive versions
of emotion-like states that are significant to navigating their social
world (De Waal 2011; Panksepp 2011). The ability to track and
appropriately respond to emotional states in conspecifics and
heterospecifics may be an important precursor of empathy, such as
might be exhibited in &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; behavior (Mons&oacute;
&amp; Wrage 2021; Romero, Castellanos, &amp; de Waal 2010). For
example, Fraser and Bugnyar (2010) studied &ldquo;consolation&rdquo;
behavior in ravens after conflicts. Upon observing consolation
behavior (such as contact sitting, preening, and beak-to-beak or
beak-to-body touching) by partners after conflicts, they explored the
question as to whether the consoling bystanders were motivated to
alleviate the victim&rsquo;s apparent distress, or rather according to
more deflationary interpretations, such as an attempt to avoid
becoming the victim of redirected aggression by the distressed partner
(Koski &amp; Sterck 2009). They found that consolation behavior was
more likely after intense conflicts, which would be more likely to
leave the victims distressed, and from bystanders with more valuable
relationships than by unaffiliated bystanders. These suggest both that
the function of the behavior is to alleviate distress rather than just
to avoid becoming the victim of redirected aggression, and stress the
importance of long-term relationships in cognitively sophisticated
animals such as ravens. Mimicry and emotional contagion of emotional
responses may also support the evolution and development of human
empathy, as long suggested by theorists like Hume and Darwin (Palagi
et al. 2020). There has even been research as to whether animals can
represent the emotions of heterospecifics, especially in domesticated
species like dogs (Albuquerque et al. 2016). Mons&oacute; in
particular has argued that emotional attributions might be made in the
absence of theory of mind, and might give behavior-reading animals an
alternative route to moral cognition (2015, 2017).
Philosophers&mdash;especially those interested in moral psychology and
the evolution of empathy&mdash;would likely benefit from familiarity
with this research.</p>

<h3 id="RelMaiRepDes">5.2 Relationship maintenance and representation of desires</h3>

<p>
Another recent trend in empirical research on social cognition in
animals has been growing interest in the ability to form and maintain
complex, long-term relationships. This interest applies not only to
competitive, hierarchical species like chimpanzees where alliances may
be important to maintaining and understanding social position, but
also in species that form long-term young-caregiver relationships in
extended neotony, and/or monogamous pair-bonding relationships, such
as corvids and parrots. Maintaining relationships over the long term
requires a kind of motivational decoupling&mdash;the ability to
represent desires or goals that differ from one&rsquo;s own&mdash;and
cooperative rearing involves the ability to balance needs and divide
the labor of caring for young or the maintenance of a nest or niche in
which to raise them (Keefner 2016; Ostoji&#263;, Legg, Dits, et al.
2016; Ostoji&#263;, Legg, Shaw, et al. 2014). Ostojic and colleagues
in particular developed a new paradigm to test for desire attributions
based on such motivational decoupling in scrub jays, a so-called
&ldquo;specific satiety&rdquo; design. In mated scrub jay pairs, as in
many other bird species, males will often bring nesting females food
while they tend eggs or young. Jays&rsquo; desires for specific types
of food could be manipulated by pre-feeding until they no longer
consumed more of that food type. This would cause them to prefer the
other kind of food. Males could then be allowed to observe the female
being pre-fed with a one food type, and then given a choice between
the pre-fed food and another type of food. The males, by contrast,
were kept on a maintenance diet that gave them no preference for one
food type over the other. The males preferentially delivered the type
of food that the females had not been pre-fed, demonstrating a
sensitivity to their preferences that differed from their own
preferences. A follow-up experiment even demonstrated that male jays
could show some sensitivity to preferences that were opposed to their
own (e.g., when the male and female were pre-fed to satiety on
different foods). This research demonstrates the potential for
studying other types of mental state attributions in other animals
that can be obtained by broadening our focus to a wider range of
functions and contexts beyond the competitive contexts in hierarchical
animals like chimpanzees that have benefited from so much prior
research.</p>

<h3 id="Pla">5.3 Play</h3>

<p>
Another interesting kind of social cognition in animals concerns play
behavior (Burghardt 2005, 2010). Play is an interesting way-station to
other more sophisticated forms of social coordination and relationship
maintenance found in many different animal species, especially amongst
their young. Play allows animals to practice and develop hunting and
fighting strategies, develop and maintain social relationships, learn
to regulate impulses, and coordinate with others (Bekoff 2004; Bekoff
&amp; Allen 1998; Bekoff &amp; Byers [eds] 1998). Play requires a
delicate balancing act, because play that is too rough can easily
degenerate into real fighting or conflict. It thus requires signaling
and constant monitoring by both animals&rsquo; of the others&rsquo;
state and willingness to continue the bout of play. Bekoff in
particular has argued that it is a waystation to moral development, as
it involves the early forms of cooperation, fairness, forgiveness, and
trust (C. Allen &amp; Bekoff 2005; Bekoff 2001). Animal play thus can
serve as a case study for the evolution of shared intentionality and
joint action, allowing us to draw comparative inferences about the
evolution of shared intentionality in humans and other animals (Heesen
et al. 2017). Critics have argued that the intentional
characterization of play involves implausibly intellectualized
representational states, such as the intention that the other agent
recognize that it is only mimicking real behaviors (such as attacks).
Rosenberg (1990), for example, worries that such construals involve at
least a third-order intentions, that &ldquo;[agent] <em>a</em> wants
[agent] <em>b</em> to believe that <em>a</em> wants to do [behavior]
<em>d</em> not seriously but with other goals or aims&rdquo; (1990:
184). Colin Allen and Bekoff (1994) respond that this kind of Gricean
analysis of play-intentions would be over-intellectualized even for
human children, and so cannot be the right analysis of pretense in
animal play. Other researchers have also more recently noted that many
components of play behavior&mdash;especially expressions and gestures
used primarily for signaling&mdash;are common between humans and many
animals, suggesting alternative, less cognitively-demanding ways to
navigate shared episodes of play (Davila-Ross &amp; Palagi 2022).</p>

<h3 id="Imi">5.4 Imitation</h3>

<p>
Imitation is another intensely studied social behavior in animal,
because it is thought to be a prerequisite for human-like cultural
learning and tool use. Imitation is often defined as the copying of
behavior or learning to move the body in a particular way by observing
others (Heyes &amp; Ray 2000; Zentall 2006). It is often distinguished
from other forms of social learning to perform tasks, such as stimulus
enhancement and intention understanding (Call, Carpenter, &amp;
Tomasello 2005; Moore 2013; Spence 1937). True imitation, many
theorists argue, requires repeating the specific motions that another
agent is observed to perform, which might be thought to require a
representation of the other agent&rsquo;s movements themselves.
Stimulus enhancement might involve repeating the same movements, but
only because the other agent&rsquo;s movements raised the salience of
some important cues to draw additional attention or associative value.
For example, if I am trying to open a locked door, observing another
reaching into their pocket and jingling their keys may remind me of
the keys in my own pocket as a means to open the door, but without any
actual representation of the other agent&rsquo;s door-opening
movements.</p>

<p>
To consider another alternative mechanism, intention understanding
might also allow an animals to achieve the same goal but without
repeating or representing the same actions; a common experimental
design to distinguish the two is to perform an action in an
inefficient or needlessly complicated way (such as turning a
nonfunctional bolt on a box before opening it), and see whether the
observing animal repeats all of the movements exactly or achieves the
same result in a different or more efficient manner (Call, Carpenter,
&amp; Tomasello 2005; Whiten, Custance, et al. 1996). Tomasello,
Kruger, and Ratner (1993) further distinguished imitation from
&ldquo;emulation&rdquo;, which pertains less to specific movements and
more to learning affordances of objects (such as that a particular
stick bends or a box lid affords opening). As with many of the other
forms of social cognition already reviewed, imitation has been
proposed by some theorists as the uniquely human trait that explains
much of our ability to engage in cultural learning and create complex
tools and technologies. Heyes (1993, 2021) has suggested that what
matters for &ldquo;true imitation&rdquo; is copying something of
specific body movement topography, such as which part of the body to
move, or how to move body parts relative to one another or to external
objects. This might include so-called &ldquo;over-imitation&rdquo;,
which involves repeating exact movements even when they lack a clear
external goal (Whiten 2019). Animals often fail to display
over-imitation while human children readily exhibit it in many
contexts, though some studies have found evidence of over-imitation in
highly social species, such as dogs (Huber et al. 2020), and Jedediah
Allen and Andrews (2024) argued on methodological grounds that many
studies on over-imitation in animals were biased towards finding
negative results, and different studies are needed. Others have argued
that the deviations from exact movement copying exhibited by many
animals are often adaptive, and might be explained by their learning
that certain movements are non-functional or irrelevant to achieving
the goal. As a result, Fridland and Moore (2015) propose amending the
definition to include an understanding that the copied behavior is
goal-directed and that the imitator has some motivation to replicate
the precise technique observed. While more recent studies have found
limited abilities to copy actions and not just goals in chimpanzees
and other non-human animals, most influential authors still hold that
humans are distinctively unparalleled in their ability to copy exact
motions when compared to other animals (Heyes 2016; Tomasello &amp;
Herrmann 2010; Whiten 2019).</p>

<p>
One important issue raised in studies of animal imitation that has
been of particular interest to philosophers concerns the role that
might be played by so-called &ldquo;mirror neurons&rdquo;. Mirror
neurons were originally discovered by accident in a neuroscientific
study on macaques, when it was found that certain neurons in premotor
areas fired both when the monkeys made a particular grasping motion
and when they observed others making the same grasping motion (di
Pellegrino et al. 1992). There was initially great hope that these
neurons might form the basis&mdash;perhaps even an innate
basis&mdash;of the topographic representation of the behavioral
movements of others that was thought to be required for true
imitation. Gallese and Goldman (1998) further argued that such neurons
could provide the basis for a simulationist approach to mindreading by
enabling organisms to automatically detect the presence of certain
distal mental states (such as motor intentions) in other
agents&mdash;as well as perhaps a wide variety of many other mental
state types like emotions (Wicker et al. 2003) or sensations such as
pain (Singer et al. 2004). Though capturing a great deal of initial
attention and promise, this story has more recently been called into
question, especially by philosophers (C. Allen 2010; Jacob 2009; Saxe
2009; Spaulding 2012, 2013). Spaulding in particular reviews empirical
and conceptual evidence to argue that while mirror neuron activity
might be a contributing cause of social understanding, it is neither
necessary nor sufficient for significant forms of mindreading on its
own (2012, 2013). Mirror neurons today remain the subject of
controversy in philosophy of psychology, with many different possible
interpretations of their representational status and corresponding
role in social cognition as theoretical options (Tramacere &amp; Moore
2020).</p>

<h3 id="Cul">5.5 Culture</h3>

<p>
A closely-related topic concerns the possibility of animal culture,
which may draw upon imitation and other forms of social learning.
Distinctively cultural learning is thought by many theorists to be the
primary explanation for humanity&rsquo;s dominance of the natural
world and for most if not all uniquely human cognitive achievements.
Though influential primatologists cited chimpanzees as a promising
target for the study of cultural innovation (Whiten, Goodall, et al.
1999), Tomasello and his co-authors in particular have emphasized
culture as the primary cognitive difference between humans and other
animals (Tomasello 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Tomasello, Carpenter, et al.
2005). Other theorists have pushed back against this view by
emphasizing the possibility of cultural traditions and cultural
learning in other animals, such as regional differences in tool-using
strategies in different populations of chimpanzees (Boesch 1996, 2003;
Boesch &amp; Tomasello 1998; Whiten 2021). Empirical evidence for
chimpanzee culture has in turn been systematically critiqued by
skeptics, who have emphasized how some of the deflationary mechanisms
already reviewed in studies of imitation, such as stimulus
enhancement, may explain the results without appealing to cultural
learning (Laland &amp; Janik 2006). More recently, Tomasello and
co-authors have conceded the existence of some cultural phenomena in
animals, but argued that other aspects remain unique to humans,
especially an iterative ability to improve with each generation; a
so-called &ldquo;ratchet effect&rdquo; that allows human culture to
improve indefinitely (Dean et al. 2014; Tennie, Call, &amp; Tomasello
2009). According to this view, animals without sufficiently flexible
forms of imitative copying are limited to a &ldquo;Zone of Latent
Solutions&rdquo; that are reachable through individualized learning
strategies, but humans can acquire traits beyond their own ZLS
(Tennie, Bandini, et al. 2020; Tennie, Call, &amp; Tomasello 2009;
though cf. Whiten 2022 for criticism). Rather than emphasizing a
single unique component, however, the more popular viewpoint is now a
multi-component account of the differences between human&rsquo;s
capacity for cultural learning and those of some of our nearest
relatives like chimpanzees&mdash;emphasizing instead tendencies
towards cooperative learning involving motivation, attention, and
attention-soliciting behavior that may be more difficult for more
competitive species like chimpanzees (Moore 2013; Tomasello 2014).
Tomasello&rsquo;s most recent view focuses on a variety of adaptations
to facilitate unique excellence in cooperation and shared
intentionality&mdash;especially enabling shared attention and
action&mdash;which he thinks enables distinctive forms of agency
(Tomasello 2022a, 2022b). Some more recent work by philosophers
returns perhaps to the first and most basic difference between humans
and non-human animals to explain the difference between human and
nonhuman cultural learning, emphasizing particular ways that
linguistic tools are required to bootstrap cultural learning and
evolution to the human-like levels (for an overview of some recent
work by philosophers, see Moore &amp; Brown 2022). These debates often
implicate distinctively human forms of other social cognitive
capacities already discussed, especially theory of mind. Philosophers
have begun questioning other components of Tomasello&rsquo;s model for
shared intentionality, such as the need for distinctively human
abstraction abilities (Papadopoulos 2023), or the development of a
notion of &ldquo;we&rdquo; and shared obligation (Bratman 2020;
Gilbert 2020). Other theorists have also studied culture and cultural
variation in non-primates, such as cetaceans and birds (Aplin 2019;
Whitehead &amp; Rendell 2015). More recently, many participants in the
chimpanzee &ldquo;culture wars&rdquo; have made peace with minimalist
definitions of culture as socially learned behavior that persists over
time or informational strategies that vary between communities, which
has invited study of cultural variation in a much wider range of
species, such as fruit flies and bumblebees (Bridges et al. 2024;
Danchin et al. 2018).</p>

<h3 id="MorEmoNorBeh">5.6 Moral Emotions and Normative Behavior</h3>

<p>
Most recently, there has been a surge of interest into whether some
forms of social cognition in animals might enable them to engage in
behaviors that can be recognized as proto-moral, especially normative
behavior and precursors of empathy. Whereas animals have for hundreds
of years been thought by philosophers and scientists to exhibit
certain precursors of morality like moral emotions (such as kindness,
patience, anger, shame, or disgust, but perhaps also more advanced and
proto-moral emotions like empathetic concern), it was almost
universally denied that they possessed anything like moral or
normative cognition. Full normative cognition, it was thought, would
require something like an ability to explicitly formulate abstract
normative rules, evaluate those rules, and determine whether behavior
accorded with them. Rowlands (2012) softened this strict denial of
moral status for animals by suggesting a distinction between moral
agents and moral patients; perhaps full-blooded moral agency required
some more substantial rational capacity to understand rules and
monitor rule-following, but animals&rsquo; ability to act
(unreflectively) for moral reasons afforded them the status of moral
patients, beings which should be afforded moral respect and allowed to
live in conditions in which they can flourish. Some theorists have
sought moral subjecthood in forms of moral emotions and empathy that
could be available in the absence of sophisticated mindreading or
theorizing capacities; Mons&oacute; (2015), for example, argues that
animals might develop forms of empathy that do not require the ability
to conceptualize the mental or emotional states of other agents.</p>

<p>
While empathy-based views often focus on moral emotions, other
theorists approach the question of normative cognition as a separate
and independent issue. Vincent, Ring, and Andrews (2018), for example,
argue that animals can behave in accordance with normative practices
even if they lack the ability to consider and evaluate fully abstract,
propositionally-formulated principles. Furthermore, such normative
practices might even be independent of the cluster of behaviors
considered indicative of empathetic concern (e.g., consolation,
cooperation, and reciprocity). Andrews (2020) develops a notion of a
simpler kind of &ldquo;ought-thought&rdquo; that she calls
&ldquo;na&iuml;ve normativity&rdquo;. Na&iuml;ve normativity, in
analogy to na&iuml;ve physics or logic, is based in an implicit
ability to determine whether one&rsquo;s behavior is in accordance
with observed group practice. Andrews, Fitzpatrick, and Westra (2022)
argue that sophisticated animals like chimpanzees have many of the
cognitive and social abilities to maintain distinctive, complex
normative practices in specific communities, especially to detect
whether one&rsquo;s behavior is in line with one&rsquo;s
community&rsquo;s practices and to enforce conformity with a norm in
others. Many forms of normative behavior that are not distinctively
moral, emotional, or empathetic can be studied here, such as
&ldquo;etiquette&rdquo; norms governing reproduction, cuisine, dress,
social ritual, and communication (Andrews, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Westra
2024). This broader focus on animal &ldquo;norm psychology&rdquo;
(Sripada &amp; Stich 2006) rather than more restrictive moral
psychology has begun to enjoy more uptake both amongst philosophers
and psychologists (Heyes 2024; Rohr, Burkart, &amp; Schaik 2011) and
has led to a burst of philosophical work scrutinizing the
norm-tracking behavior in cognitively sophisticated animals like
chimpanzees (Mons&oacute; &amp; Andrews 2022; Fitzpatrick 2020;
Mons&oacute; &amp; Moore 2024; Papadopoulos &amp; Andrews 2022; R.
Powell 2023; Schlingloff &amp; Moore 2018), suggesting the emergence
of another burgeoning flashpoint of interdisciplinary collaboration
between philosophy and psychology.</p>

<h2 id="Sum">6. Summary</h2>

<p>
As the above discussions suggest, the study of animal social cognition
is rife with philosophical interest, and the walls between science and
philosophy have here been extremely permeable for some time. Many
scientists studying these capacities are open to working with
philosophers, and many philosophers in this area have worked in the
labs of key scientists. The complexity of the subject matter and its
connection to key questions about human uniqueness allows it to serve
as an interesting case study for many important issues in philosophy
of mind, philosophy of science, epistemology, and ethics&mdash;likely
with many new and fruitful interdisciplinary collaborations to
come.</p> <!-- bib check so far -->
