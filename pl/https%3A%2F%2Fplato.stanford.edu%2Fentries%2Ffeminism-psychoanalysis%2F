<h1>Psychoanalytic Feminism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon May 16, 2011; substantive revision Fri Oct 3, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
This article will discuss psychoanalytic feminism, not feminist
psychoanalysis (i.e., except indirectly, it will not address ideas
about developing feminist principles in clinical practice, although
most of the authors discussed below are trained analysts). The
Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud, who introduced the field of
psychoanalysis in the late 19th and early 20th century, developed a
theory of the unconscious that links sexuality and subjectivity
ineluctably together. In doing so, he discloses how our sense of self,
political loyalties, and attachments are influenced by unconscious
drives and ordered by symbolic structures beyond the purview of
individual agency. While some feminists have outlined implicit and
explicit biases toward women contained in Freud&rsquo;s psychoanalytic
thought, other feminist thinkers have, nonetheless, undertaken a
serious reading of Freud and developed careful analyses of their
fundamental concepts, working out their limits, impasses, and
possibilities.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Femininity,&rdquo; Freud writes that &ldquo;psycho-analysis
does not try to describe what a woman is&mdash;that would be a task it
could scarcely perform&mdash;but sets about enquiring how she comes
into being, how a woman develops out of a child with a bisexual
disposition&rdquo; (Freud 1933 [1964: 144]). The bisexual child is one
who psychically is not yet either a man or a woman. Freud here
portrays femininity as one trajectory of the Oedipal Complex and
indicates that sexed identity is a fragile achievement rather than a
natural given or essence. By circumscribing the terrain on which the
psychoanalytic account of sexual difference moves, and by seeing
unresolved riddles where others might see the work of nature or
culture, Freud problematizes any causal, seamless, or direct tie
between sex, sexuality, and sexual difference. Psychoanalytic inquiry
then does not fit comfortably with, and even unsettles, biological
theories of sex and sociological theories of gender, thus also
complicating the sex/gender distinction that some feminist theorists
have formulated in terms of the contrast between biology and culture
in feminist debates. Likewise, psychoanalytic feminism interrupts many
assumptions about what feminism is, and the material objects it
theorizes, including especially the very concept of woman.</p>

<p>
While there is no doubt a vast oeuvre of disparate positions that
might fall within the framework of psychoanalytic feminism, what they
share in common is a descent from, respect for, and a drawing on
Freudian psychoanalytic concepts, even while criticizing and revising
his theoretical apparatus. Before this article outlines the multiple
and divergent articulations of psychoanalytic feminism, it returns to
Freud to establish the historical roots and the conceptual terrain on
which psychoanalytic feminism arises. While this article introduces
the reader to central psychoanalytic concepts, it will devote
particular attention to Freud&rsquo;s theories of the unconscious as
they pertain to sexual differentiation and the Oedipal Complex, since
a great deal of psychoanalytic feminism is concerned with revising the
Oedipal narrative of Freud. Psychoanalytic feminists have also turned
to the French psychoanalytic thinker Jacques Lacan, who drew on and
further developed Freudian psychoanalysis in the late 20th century.
Therefore, this article will also introduce Lacan&rsquo;s central
theoretical concepts before outlining how feminist thinkers have
appropriated Lacanian psychoanalysis.</p>

<h2 id="FreuRiddFemi">1. The Freudian Riddle of Femininity</h2>

<p>
Freud distinguishes two primary drives: the love drive (Eros) and the
death drive (Thanatos). As he points out in <em>Civilization and Its
Discontents</em> (1930) &ldquo;Libido&rdquo; refers to the
manifestation of the power of Eros, that is, the energy of love drive,
with sexual love as its nucleus and sexual union as its aim. However,
Freud conceptualizes &ldquo;love&rdquo; in a broader sense, which
includes not only sexual love for others but also self-love,
friendship, and devotion to concrete objects and abstract ideas (1930
[1989: 80]). The aggressive drive is the main representative of the
death drive, and manifests itself in a mutual hostility between and
among people.</p>

<p>
The death drive opposes civilization and threatens it perpetually with
disintegration. For Freud, civilization is the struggle between Eros
and Thanatos, between the drives of life and death. The most critical
task of civilization is to set limits to the aggressive drive (1930
[1989: 69&ndash;70]). He outlines two ways in which civilization sets
limits to the aggressive drive. First, through inhibiting the aim of
libido (sexual union) and instead fostering affectionate ties between
people. Second, establishing a superego within our psyches to monitor
the aggressive drive. The superego is the part of the ego that
observes, monitors, and criticizes the ego.</p>

<p>
Therefore, rather than the rationally self-interested individual
presumed by liberal political theory or the self-contained and
independent cogito presumed by Cartesian epistemology, Freud puts
forward a split subject in that the ego is both a subject and an
object. As Freud outlines in the <em>New Introductory Lectures on
Psycho-Analysis</em> (1933), although the ego is a subject, it can
take itself as an object and treat itself like other objects by
observing and criticizing itself. In Freud&rsquo;s words, in the
superego &ldquo;part of the ego is setting itself over against the
rest. So, the ego can be split; it splits itself during several
functions&mdash;temporarily at least. Its parts can come together
again afterward.&rdquo; (1933 [1990: 73]). The superego is the part of
the ego that sets itself over against the rest to take over and
monitor our desire for aggressiveness and direct it back to where it
came from&mdash;the ego.</p>

<p>
The ego&rsquo;s task is to satisfy the divergent and often
incompatible demands of what Freud calls &ldquo;three tyrannical
masters&rdquo;&mdash;the superego, the unconscious (the id), and the
external world. The ego aims to represent the demands and standards of
the external world to the id while also carrying out the id&rsquo;s
intentions as it&rsquo;s from the id that the ego derives its life
force. At the same time, the strict superego observes the ego at every
step it takes and lays down definite standards for its conduct (1933
[1990:97]). The ego faces resistance against obeying the
superego&rsquo;s commands, foremost because of the strength of the
unconscious energy of repressed aggressive (and libidinal) drives that
lie in wait to unleash themselves.</p>

<p>
Freud also explains that the presence of repressed drives unsettles
any notion of a stable ego. As he puts it, the stability of the ego
&ldquo;is exposed to constant shocks. In dreams and in neuroses, what
is thus excluded knocks for admission at the gates, guarded though
they are by resistances&rdquo; (1921 [1989:80]). The resistances allow
only portions of the repressed material, often disguised, to enter our
consciousness, such as in dreams and neuroses. Freud studied neuroses
in his works on hysteria. In his early works on hysteria, we also find
his claim about the impact of sexuality on psychic processes, which he
changed in his later works. In hysteria, a repressed memory or an
unconscious conflict is converted into a physical symptom without any
physical causes. In <em>Studies in Hysteria</em> (1895), written in
collaboration with the neurophysiologist Josef Breuer, Freud posits
the &ldquo;seduction hypothesis,&rdquo; which implies that hysterical
symptoms arise as a result of a trauma &ndash; childhood sexual
violence. The repressed memory becomes somatized (enacted on the body
and in bodily symptoms) when a later event, usually occurring in
puberty, catalyzes the earlier memory traces.</p>

<p>
In the later <em>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</em> (1905a),
Freud contends, contrary to the earlier supposition that sexuality
intervenes from the outside, that sexuality is a primordial force of
infantile life, arising from the bodily sensations that accompany the
life processes. In the interim between these two works, Freud
abandoned the seduction hypothesis and replaced it with the thesis of
infantile sexuality and the idea that symptoms are brought about
through conflicts and repressions of unconscious fantasies. To
understand the significance of this transition in his thinking, we
must grasp what Freud means by psychical reality and its distinction
from material reality. In contrast to the historical, intersubjective
domain of material reality, psychical reality is the vital domain of
fantasy and intra-psychic life, operating independently of objective
considerations of veracity.</p>

<p>
In Freud&rsquo;s view, unconscious fantasies are not lies or
deceptions, but they reveal a concealed truth, not about the objective
world, but about the internal life of the subject. In discarding the
seduction hypothesis, Freud not only discovers the domain of fantasy
and psychic reality, but he also paves the way for considering the
energetics of the libido. However, Freud never abjures the reality of
sexual abuse. Instead, the hysteric symptom no longer originates in
(presumably rare) childhood sexual violence, but in repressed
unconscious fantasies that accompany sexual differentiation, the
becoming of a woman (or a man) out of a child with a bisexual
constitution.</p>

<p>
For Freud, bisexuality implies &ldquo;an individual is not a man or a
woman but always both&mdash;merely a certain amount more the one than
the other&rdquo; (1933 [1990: 141]). The proportion to which
&ldquo;masculinity&rdquo; and &ldquo;femininity&rdquo; is mixed in
individuals implies fluctuations. In &ldquo;Hysterical Phantasies and
Their Relation to Bisexuality (1908),&rdquo; and his &ldquo;General
Remarks on Hysterical Attacks&rdquo; (1909), Freud also details how
the hysteric symptom emerges when the child with a bisexual
constitution has to give up her masculinity (or femininity) to emerge
as a woman (or man).</p>

<p>
Here, it is important to note that for Freud, there is no essential
femininity and masculinity. Instead, he asserts that &ldquo;what
constitutes masculinity or femininity is an unknown characteristic,
which anatomy cannot lay hold of&rdquo; (1933 [1990: 142, emphasis
added]). He also problematizes the association of activity (and
aggression) with masculinity and passivity with femininity and points
out that social customs often force women into passivity. Furthermore,
the denial of women&rsquo;s aggression can create masochistic
tendencies in women, where they turn their aggressive drive against
themselves.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, in Freud&rsquo;s discussion of hysteria and the Oedipal
Complex, he often associates femininity with passivity and masculinity
with activity (such as his assertion that pre-Oedipal female sexuality
is masculine and active, and Oedipal female sexuality is feminine and
passive), which contradicts his assertion that there is no essential
femininity and masculinity. One way to understand this contradiction
is that Freud describes &ldquo;masculinity&rdquo; and
&ldquo;femininity&rdquo; as what is stereotypically associated with
these concepts in a patriarchal society. Another way to understand
this contradiction is that masculinity and femininity are in Freudian
psychoanalyses unconscious sexual fantasies &ndash; they pertain to
the realm of fantasy rather than nature or culture and reveal a
concealed truth about the realm of psychic reality rather than
material reality</p>

<p>
For example, Freud points out that when psychoanalysts aim to resolve
the hysteric symptom they are confronted with two unconscious sexual
fantasies, one which has a masculine and the other a feminine
character (1908 [1997:54]). In his &ldquo;General Remarks on
Hysterical Attacks&rdquo; (1909), he explains that the hysteric attack
in women recalls the masculine form of sexual activity to action that
existed during childhood. As he puts it, &ldquo;In a whole series of
cases the hysterical neurosis is nothing but an excessive
over-accentuation of the typical wave of repression through which the
masculine type of sexuality is removed and the woman emerges&rdquo;
(1909 [1997:53]).</p>

<p>
Therefore, neuroses are the result of the repression of the bisexual
constitution, which all children have to go through to emerge as women
or men. I include men here, as Freud initially studied neurosis
through hysteria in men, and his first two public presentations on
hysteria in Vienna (1886) dealt with male hysterics. Although Freud in
his later works discussed hysteria chiefly through his analyses of
women (and it remains chiefly associated with women), the male
hysteric resurfaces in his unpublished works, including talks,
correspondence, and his personal life.</p>

<p>
Freud further detailed the content of sexual fantasies with the
Oedipal Complex. In his later writings on femininity, including
&ldquo;Femininity&rdquo; (1933), &ldquo;Female Sexuality&rdquo;
(1931), and &ldquo;Some Psychical Consequences of the Anatomical
Distinction between the Sexes&rdquo; (1925), Freud postulates that the
little girl&rsquo;s Oedipal Complex runs a different course than the
little boy&rsquo;s and holds a different relation to castration
anxiety during sexual differentiation. Crucially, Freud maintains that
femininity (and masculinity) cannot be grasped from a biological
perspective.</p>

<p>
Instead, sexual differentiation is centrally concerned with psychical
reality and the realm of fantasy. The Oedipal story details the
unconscious sexual fantasies that accompany our becoming subjects and,
in becoming subjects, how we become sexually differentiated. In the
pre-Oedipal phase, children are not yet sexually differentiated. Here
the girl and the boy have a strong libidinal attachment to the
&ldquo;phallic mother&rdquo; whom they envision as having a penis.
Insofar as Freud associates the child&rsquo;s desire for the mother
with masculinity (and activity), he also defines libido as masculine.
Still Freud acknowledges that in the libido&rsquo;s most primordial
stages, there can be no sexual distinction.</p>

<p>
It is not until children pass through the Oedipal Complex that they
can properly be said to have a genital organization which is acquired
through a relation to castration and is the last stage in sexual
development (following oral, anal, and phallic stages). For Freud, all
children are in the undifferentiated phase &ldquo;little men&rdquo;
with a phallic and active sexuality. Here, the girl experiences her
father as a rival in her quest to seduce the mother and bear her a
child. In addition, akin to the boy who derives pleasure from his
&ldquo;little penis,&rdquo; the girl actively derives pleasure from
her &ldquo;little phallus&rdquo; &ndash; her clitoris &ndash; via
masturbation (1933 [1997:148&ndash;50]).</p>

<p>
In order to become a woman and pass from the &ldquo;masculine&rdquo;
into the &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; phase, the girl has to switch from her
first object of love, the mother, to the father. Furthermore, she has
to give up her focus on active sexuality and clitoral pleasure and,
from now on, must passively focus on her vagina (1933 [1997:147]).
Freud seems genuinely puzzled about how femininity comes about given
the girl&rsquo;s initial love for the mother, why she would switch
allegiances to the father, and whom she experienced as a rival. And
since prior to the genital organization, she too goes through a
phallic (masturbatory) stage, why would she switch the site of bodily
pleasure from the clitoris to the vagina?</p>

<p>
These are among the mysteries he means to designate when referring to
the riddle of femininity. That he understands it to be a riddle also
intimates that he understands sexual identity not as a natural
pre-given essence rooted in anatomy but rather as a form of
individuation and differentiation realized through a complex
interaction between the bodily drives and familial others. Freud
postulates that it is the realization that the mother does not have a
penis as the girl initially assumed, and that she is castrated, that
prompts the little girl to turn her love away from the mother and
toward her father, from whom she expects the penis via a penis-baby
(which is fulfilled when she gets a baby later), and which turns the
mother into a rival.</p>

<p>
For the girl, castration does not resolve the Oedipal Complex but
leads her to enter it, and for this reason Freud claims that it is
never wholly brought to a conclusion, and that it is more difficult
for her to form a superego 1933 [1997:160]). There is a great deal of
feminist literature that accuses Freud of &ldquo;matricide&rdquo; and
the repression of the pre-Oedipal mother via the Oedipus complex (see
below). Freud, however, repeatedly points at the important of the
girls&rsquo; pre-Oedipal attachment to the mother and points out that
&ldquo;For a long time the girl&rsquo;s Oedipus complex concealed her
pre-Oedipal attachment to the mother from our view, though it is
nevertheless so important and leaves such lasting fixations behind
it.&rdquo; (1933 [1997:160]). One such fixation is the continuing
hostility of the girl toward the mother. Furthermore, for Freud,
femininity is a fragile achievement, and &ldquo;in the course of
women&rsquo;s lives there is a repeated alteration between periods in
which masculinity or femininity gains the upper hand&rdquo; (1933
[1997:162]). Therefore, the bisexual constitution, which the girl had
to repress to emerge as a woman, remains a force throughout her
life.</p>

<p>
The boy&rsquo;s story is more seamless and continuous since he retains
his phallic pleasure and, although he must displace the immediate
object of his desire (no longer the mother, but someone like her), can
look forward to substitute objects. The boy&rsquo;s Oedipal attachment
to the mother follows uninterrupted from a pre-Oedipal attachment, and
it is brought to an end by the threat of castration emanating from the
father. At the conclusion of the Oedipal Complex, the boy identifies
with the father, sets up a severe super-ego (as a result of the threat
of castration), and abandons the immediate object of desire (the
mother) with the promise that he too will one day possess a similar
object modeled on the mother (1933 [1997:160]).</p>

<p>
Freud&rsquo;s theories of sexuality and the unconscious implicate not
only individual psychology but also the constitution of social life.
Formed in ambivalent relation to others, sexuality, and sexual
identity permeate the bonds of civilization and ramify throughout all
social relations. In turning his attention to broader cultural
questions, Freud offers a story or myth of the origin of political
structures that parallels and echoes his understanding of the
individual psyche. To understand the political import of the Oedipal
Complex, placing it more generally within the scope of Freud&rsquo;s
understanding of group psychology will be helpful.</p>

<p>
In <em>Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego</em> (1921), Freud
contests any clear-cut opposition between group and individual
psychology. The individual subject is neither formed wholly
independently in a solitary interiority nor formed as merely an effect
of exterior social forces. In this text, we learn why people join what
Freud calls &ldquo;psychological masses&rdquo; and uncritically
subordinate themselves to the will of a leader. Freud explains how the
mass leader artificially makes the followers &ldquo;fall in
love&rdquo; with him by creating aim-inhibited libidinal ties between
the followers and himself. The mass followers then unite with each
other and temporarily repress their hostility against each other
through identification via their shared libidinal or love tie with the
mass leader.</p>

<p>
However, Freud points out that love need not be the central element
that unifies mass followers. Instead, &ldquo;the leader or the leading
idea might also, so to speak, be negative; hatred against a particular
person or institution might operate in just the same unifying way, and
might call up the same unifying emotional ties as positive
attachment&rdquo; (1921 [1990:41]). Nothing binds people together in
love like a common hatred against an &ldquo;intruder&rdquo;, upon whom
they can unleash their aggression. Therefore, one can bind together
large numbers of people in love, so long as there are other people
left over to receive the manifestations of their aggressiveness. He
points out how historically the hatred towards Jewish people had
served to unite Christians &ldquo;in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Freud describes the processes that establish the libidinal ties
between the mass followers and the leader with the idea of ego ideal
replacement. The ego ideal serves as the repository of standards of
perfection of various sorts. It represents our ideal view of ourselves
and what we aspire to be like. Since we cannot always live up to our
ego ideal, we feel a tension between the ego and the ego ideal in us
that makes us feel like failures. Therefore, argues Freud, the
&ldquo;separation of the ego ideal from the ego cannot be born for
long either, and has to be temporarily undone&rdquo; (1921 [1990:81]).
In festivals, the separation of the ego ideal from the ego is
temporarily undone, and their cheerful character signifies a release
from ego ideal demands.</p>

<p>
In a psychological mass, the followers internalize the idealized
leader figure and replace their ego ideal with the leader figure,
which generates a more permanent undoing of the separation between the
ego and the ego ideal, which allows them to get rid of feelings of
failure and inferiority and feel via the leader &ldquo;great
again.&rdquo; Furthermore, in a psychological mass, we transfer our
renounced narcissism or self-love to the leader, and the leader (the
love object) &ldquo;serves as a substitute for some unattained ego
ideal of our own. We love it on account of the perfections which we
have striven to reach for our own ego, and which we should now procure
in this roundabout way as a means to satisfying our narcissism&rdquo;
(1921 [1990:56]).</p>

<p>
The problem of transferring our self-love to the leader is that our
love becomes blind and we ascribe perfection to the love object, to
which the leader has no claim. Furthermore, when the love object (the
leader) gets in possession of the entire self-love of the ego, at the
end, &ldquo;(t)he object, has, so to speak, consumed the ego.&rdquo;
(1921 [1990:56&ndash;57, emphasis added]). Subjects with an
impoverished and consumed ego completely surrender themselves to the
leader and fail to be critical of his deeds and demands on the
followers, and they are ready to carry out crimes for their
leader.</p>

<p>
Freud also explains the complete surrender of the followers to the
leader, because ego ideal replacement generates also a regression to
an older form of human psychology, the psychology of the &ldquo;primal
horde&rdquo; which makes us, in a way akin to hypnosis, experience the
leader as the primal father with a dangerous personality to whose will
we must surrender. As Freud puts it, &ldquo;The leader of the group is
still the dreaded father; the group still wishes to be governed by
unrestricted force; it has an extreme passion for authority. . . The
primal father is the group ideal, which governs the ego in the place
of the ego ideal&rdquo; (1921 [1990:7]). In the hypnotic state, the
conscious personality of the hypnotized mass followers vanishes, and
their unconscious personality predominates, which makes it easier for
the leader to manipulate the followers for his purposes.</p>

<p>
In <em>Totem and Taboo</em> (1913) Freud outlines the archaic
&ldquo;primal horde,&rdquo; which refers to an earlier form of human
society that was ruled despotically by a powerful and threatening
male, the primal father, which gets reactivated in mass psychology.
The experience of the primal horde is part of our inheritance; it has
left traces in all of our psyches. In the primal horde, the brothers
had ambivalent feelings toward their father. The brothers hated him
because he was an obstacle to their cravings for power and satisfying
their sexual desires on the women that belonged to the father, but
they also loved and admired him. None of the brothers individually
could topple and replace the father, which was why they banded
together to kill him. After they killed him they devoured him, which
allowed them to gain a portion of his strength. The totem meal, which
is our earliest festival, commemorates this criminal deed.
Furthermore, totemism was the beginning of social organization, moral
restrictions, and religion (1913 [1989:176]).</p>

<p>
After the brothers killed the father, they took for themselves the
father&rsquo;s women who have been set free, offenses that mirror, at
a collective level, the repressed Oedipal desires of the male child.
But soon, the affection toward him which the brother had pushed aside
made itself felt. Here, a &ldquo;sense of guilt&rdquo; appeared,
coinciding with the remorse the whole group felt. Out of this sense of
guilt, the brothers created two fundamental taboos: first, the incest
taboo, which implied a renunciation of the father&rsquo;s women and
not having sexual relations with a woman of the same totem (exogamy),
which allowed the brothers to set aside their rivalry and band
together. Second, the taboo to kill the totem animal which served as a
substitute for the father. To preclude the possibility that what
happened to the father might happen to them, they added to the
religiously based prohibition to kill the totem animal the socially
based prohibition against fratricide, which was called &ldquo;Thou
shalt do no murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The prohibitions on incest and murder, thus, have a common origin and
emerge simultaneously. Together, they mandate the social processes of
exogamy (marriage outside one&rsquo;s kin) and totemism (communal
bonds of affiliation established through the medium of a common
ancestor). Furthermore, the two taboo prohibitions coincide in their
content with the two crimes of Oedipus, who killed his father and
married his mother. Therefore, the totemic system was a product of the
conditions involved in the Oedipus complex (1913 [1989:164]).</p>

<p>
Totemism and exogamy engendered fraternal equality: in order for no
one take the place of the father and assume his singular power, the
brothers were equally constrained and equally respected. In the
Freudian narrative, it is merely the father/son relationship that
seems to matter for the establishment of equality amongst brothers,
and women merely serve as objects of exchange. However, Freud also
explains that the primal horde is the story of the beginning of
patriarchy. He points out that totemism marks the beginning where a
matriarchal organization of the family was replaced with a patriarchal
one (1913 [1989:179]).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Freud points out that great mother goddesses may have
preceded the father-gods that the brothers created to atone for their
killing of the father (1913 [1989:185]). The brothers introduced the
totem as the first father surrogate and later created father-deities
to bring about a reconciliation with the murdered father. It results
from their sense of guilt and an attempt to calm that feeling and
appease the father by deferring obedience to him. The elevation of the
murdered father into a totem and father-deity tallowed the brothers to
submit to his authority to atone for their deed.</p>

<p>
However, such elevation also marked the beginning of a patriarchal
organization of society. As Freud points out that &ldquo;with the
introduction of father-deities a fatherless society gradually changed
into one organized on a patriarchal basis. The family was a
restoration of the former primal horde and it gives back to fathers a
large portion of their former rights&rdquo; (1913 [1989:185]). The
introduction of the patriarchal system and dominance of the
father&rsquo;s authority at its climax allowed the deposed father to
took harsh revenge for being eliminated earlier.</p>

<p>
Freud points out that the son&rsquo;s rebelliousness never became
extinct. For example, in the Christian communion the guilty deed
toward the father is commemorated and repeated (1913 [1989:192]).
However, what Freud did not hint at is the daughter&rsquo;s
rebelliousness against the establishment of the patriarchal order, in
which they were allotted a secondary position below men, which brings
us to feminist critiques and appropriations of Freudian psychoanalysis
in the next section.</p>

<p>
Freud also addresses patriarchy in his <em>Jokes and Their Relation to
the Unconscious</em> (1905). In general, Freud makes a core
distinction between humor and tendentious jokes, which are hostile and
obscene jokes. In <em>Humor</em> (1927), he points out that while
humor is located in the preconscious, jokes are in the unconscious.
While humor has a transformative potential because here the super-ego
is less stern and allows us a small amount of pleasure to alleviate
our suffering, tendentious jokes produce pleasure in us because they
lift repressions and allow us to temporarily relieve our aggressive
impulses (via hostile or racist jokes) and direct libidinal impulses
(via sexually aggressive jokes), which we have repressed into our
unconscious, into our ego, and this generates vast amounts of pleasure
in us.</p>

<p>
Freud points out that over the course of civilization, we have had to
repress our libido and aggression. Aggressive and obscene jokes
provide a means of undoing the renunciation and retrieving what was
lost. In relation to obscene jokes, a man develops a &ldquo;hostile
trend against that second person,&rdquo; a woman, because she has
rejected his sexual advances, which left his libidinal drive
inhibited. Here, the man makes a joke, which takes the woman as the
object of sexual aggressiveness. As the joke exposes and shames the
woman, it allows the man to retrieve lost sexual pleasure.
Freud&rsquo;s argument that &ldquo;women&rsquo;s incapacity to
tolerate undisguised sexuality&rdquo; turns men into sexual aggressors
via jokes is problematic, because it makes women responsible for
men&rsquo;s sexual aggression toward them (1905 [2013:144]). However,
he also outlines that men&rsquo;s laughter at an obscene joke is cruel
toward the woman, as the man &ldquo;is laughing as though as he were
the spectator of an act of sexual aggression&rdquo; (1905
[2013:139).</p>

<p>
In addition, Freud shows us that besides the man, who makes the joke,
and the woman, who is the object of sexual aggressiveness, the
sexually aggressive joke also needs an outside person, the third
person, to whom the joke is communicated, for its completion. Here
obscene (or sexually aggressive) jokes bribe the listener (the third
person) with an effortless satisfaction of his libido to side with the
maker of the joke. The joke exposes the woman &ldquo;before the third,
who, as a listener, has now been bribed by the effortless satisfaction
of his own libido.&rdquo; (1905 [2013:143). While the listener to the
joke might initially not harbor any conscious sexist tendencies, he
becomes bribed with an easy yield of pleasure to take sides with the
joke&rsquo;s maker. Furthermore, to avoid upsetting the pleasure
derived from tendentious jokes, there&rsquo;s an incentive for the
follower not to reflect on the content of such jokes critically, which
generates an uncritical attitude in the listener.</p>

<h2 id="FemiCritApprFreuPsyc">2. Feminist Critiques and Appropriations of Freudian Psychoanalysis</h2>

<p>
Even in Freud&rsquo;s circle, not all analysts agreed with
Freud&rsquo;s assessment, and there were debates concerning
women&rsquo;s sexuality and the roles of castration and penis envy
therein, notably among Karl Abraham, Ernest Jones, Helene Deutsch, and
Karen Horney. Horney (2000), in particular, argued for an inherent
feminine disposition that is not merely a secondary formation premised
on castration, and she took issue with the ostensible effects of penis
envy and women&rsquo;s supposed feelings of inferiority. As with some
later feminist criticisms of Freud, Horney attempted to retrieve
female sexuality, and by extension a valid form of feminine existence,
by appealing to a genuinely independent nature and holding culture
culpable for women&rsquo;s subordinate status. By thus reasserting the
primacy of biological and social forces, however, Horney disputes
precisely the idea that is central to Freud&rsquo;s hypothesis and
that marks psychoanalysis as a unique field of inquiry, that of a
distinctive psychical realm of representation that is unconscious.</p>

<p>
Somewhat later, Simone de Beauvoir addressed the discourse of
psychoanalysis in the French context in <em>The Second Sex</em>
(1949), devoting an early chapter to her distrust of &ldquo;The
Psychoanalytic Point of View&rdquo; (Beauvoir 1949 [1989:
38&ndash;52]). Like Horney, Beauvoir denounces Freud&rsquo;s idea that
there is but one masculine libido and no feminine libido with
&ldquo;its own original nature&rdquo; (1949 [1989: 39]). Beauvoir
takes Freud to task for not considering the social origins of
masculine and paternal power and privilege and deems his theory
inadequate to account for woman&rsquo;s otherness. If women envy men,
she argues, it is because of the social power and privilege they enjoy
and not because of anatomical superiority. For Beauvoir, Freudian
psychoanalysis presents the characteristics of femininity and
subjectivity as divergent paths incompatible with one another. Women
might be able to be full persons, subjects with agency, but only at
the expense of their femininity; or they can embark on the course of
femininity, but only by sacrificing their independence and agency.</p>

<p>
Beauvoir&rsquo;s project of elucidating the paradoxical relation
between femininity and subjectivity is nonetheless influenced by
psychoanalytic concepts and appropriates its theoretical insights in
various ways. <em>The Second Sex</em> highlights the practices by
which women become women through their appropriation of bodily
(sexual) difference, as well as the manner in which a human being
generally is limited and compelled by bodily and unconscious forces.
Indeed, Beauvoir and Freud seem to agree that one is not born but
becomes a woman, i.e., that femininity involves some (social or
psychical) process rather than a biological or natural given. Both are
interested in the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of this process, how one becomes a
woman, although they disagree about this &ldquo;how&rdquo;.
Furthermore, for Beauvoir, as for Freud, there is no such thing as a
disembodied, non-sexed human being; any ideal of the human apart from
sexual identity or difference is an abstraction that can only be
affirmed on the basis of a mind/body dualism. Also, like Freud,
Beauvoir is fully aware of the impact on children of their domestic
situation, the way familial life resonates with meaning that informs
not only intimate relations but relations to the larger world.</p>

<p>
There are also later feminist appropriations of Freudian
psychoanalysis. The Canadian psychoanalytic feminist Irene Fast, in
her <em>Gender Identity: A Differentiation Model</em> (1984), draws on
Freud&rsquo;s idea of an initial undifferentiated and bisexual phase
to rethink gender identity but also departs from it. While Freud
suggests that girls and boys assume that they are &ldquo;male&rdquo;
in the undifferentiated phase and that the development of femininity
is a rejection of an early masculinity, Fast assumes that children
internalize a broad spectrum of attributes of their environment in the
undifferentiated phase, regardless of whether they are ascribed to the
&ldquo;female&rdquo; or &ldquo;male&rdquo; gender. In such a phase,
the child does not have any feeling whether it is &ldquo;female&rdquo;
or &ldquo;male.&rdquo; Instead, the child has the narcissistic
experience of unlimited possibilities that are not limited by gender
(Fast 1984 [1991: 24]). Furthermore, the child assumes not only that
mothers have a penis, as Freud argued, but also that the fathers can
have babies. Around the second half of the second year, the child,
through educational practices, realizes that certain characteristics
cannot or are not allowed to be their own.</p>

<p>
Here the child starts to identify itself and others as
&ldquo;female&rdquo; or &ldquo;male&rdquo; and rejects attributes that
are ascribed to the other sex. The girl has to accept that she does
not have a penis and those aspects of her self that are not in line
with her gender. The boy has to give up the idea that he can bear
babies and those aspects of his self that are not in line with his
gender, which is, according to Fast, harder for the boy than the girl.
The girl and the boy experience a loss, to have to give up attributes
they considered as their own through early identifications (Fast 1984
[1991: 18]). Here, the girl&rsquo;s &ldquo;penis envy&rdquo; becomes a
symbol of having to give up intellectual precocity, bodily strength
and the expression of aggression. Also, the girl&rsquo;s wanting a
penis is not a demand for a return to &ldquo;masculinity&rdquo; as
Freud claims, but stands for the demand to return to the experience of
unlimited possibilities in the undifferentiated phase (Fast 1984
[1991: 29]). Furthermore, similarly to Freud, Fast argues that the
child never fully accepts the gendered boundaries that have been put
upon her, which we can see in the arts, ceremonies, and emotional
disturbances of the adult.</p>

<p>
The German feminist psychoanalyst Christa Rhode-Dachser, in her
<em>Expeditionen in the dunklen Kontinent</em> (Expeditions into the
Dark Continent, 1991) reveals the unconscious phantasies that we find
not only in Freud&rsquo;s theory of femininity but also in central
psychoanalytic categories. Such unconscious phantasies express a
gender ideology that contains hierarchical male/female dichotomies,
where the male is set prior to and above the female. Such gender
ideology is not merely the expression of the unconscious of the author
(Freud and later psychoanalytic thinkers) but the expression of a
collective unconscious in a patriarchal society. For her, the
psychoanalytic theory of unconscious processes provides a key for
understanding unconscious phantasies in psychoanalytic texts. Such
unconscious phantasies reflect dominant societal imaginations of
femininity and masculinity and deliver normative measurements for the
unmasculine and unfeminine, which are central to socialization of men
and women who reproduce patriarchal society.</p>

<p>
For Rhode-Dachser, femininity in psychoanalysis implies a
&ldquo;container function&rdquo; &ndash; it refers to an an imaginary
room that is declared as feminine and sharply distinguished from the
world of men. Man projects into this imaginary room his anxieties,
wishes, desires &ndash; everything that he is not allowed and does not
want to be so that it is preserved in this way and he can always
return to it (Rhode-Dachser 1991: 100). Such unconscious phantasies
establish the identity of men and their place in patriarchal society
&ndash; he is what she is not. In addition, they legitimize the
existing societal gender arrangement where men occupy a dominant
position. While most psychoanalytic feminists have challenged
Freud&rsquo;s idea of a masculine libido, Rhode-Dachser shows us that
we find in Freud&rsquo;s and later psychoanalytic texts, more broadly,
masculinity associated with life (libido and the ego) and femininity
with death (the death drive and the unconscious). Such unconscious
phantasies express men&rsquo;s fears of death and their desire for
immortality. As she puts it, &ldquo;what the man fears (castration,
dependency, bodily deficiencies, death) is projected onto the woman,
and now in her pitied, despised and denied&rdquo; (1991: 138). As the
conqueror of death, the man now stands firmly on the side of life.</p>

<p>
The Austrian American psychoanalytic feminist Else Frenkel-Brunswik
employs a feminist approach in her contributions to <em>The
Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950 [2019]). This study, which was
conducted in the United States of America by a group of psychoanalysts
and critical theorists, draws on Freudian psychoanalysis to explore
the origins of fascism not merely as a political phenomenon but as the
manifestation of dispositions that lie at the very core of the modern
psyche. The study explains how such dispositions make people
susceptible to fascist propaganda. Frenkel-Brunswik explains that
authoritarian family structures, which are the result of economic
societal structures, with rigid gender roles and a dominating father
figure, generate dispositions in children (and later adults) who
cannot admit ambiguity (such as the ambiguity of our gender identity),
which make them susceptible to fascist propaganda.</p>

<p>
Frenkel-Brunswik outlines two interconnected reasons why people cannot
admit ambiguity: the lack of an internalized superego and an
overwhelming aggression drive. Unlike Freud, who suggests that the
outcome of the Oedipal complex allows only the boy to internalize a
superego, Frenkel-Brunswik points out that in an authoritarian family,
neither the boy nor the girl can internalize the superego. The reason
for this is that in an authoritarian family, the child cannot
establish a genuine identification with her parents, which would allow
him to internalize the moral standards of the adult world and generate
an internalized superego. Instead, the child develops an externalized
superego, meaning that its behavior is not guided by internal
standards but by external authority figures. Since the child does not
have an internalized superego that keeps her libidinal and aggressive
drives in check, the id drives are in danger of breaking through at
any time.</p>

<p>
In addition, in authoritarian families, parents do not enable their
children to work through their unconscious drives, which could allow
them to integrate such drives. Furthermore, because the child is
forced to fearfully submit to parental authority, she develops a
considerable amount of aggression towards the parents, which she,
however, cannot admit and must repress. To cope with that danger of id
impulses breaking through, the child (and later adult) develops a
simple, often stereotypical, cognitive and emotional structure that
allows them to avoid ambiguity. Women and (men) who cannot admit
ambiguity are drawn to fascism because it offers them rigid binaries,
including rigid male/female, friend/enemy, and ingroup/outgroup
binaries that allow them to fend off ambiguity and provide them with
outlets (fascism&rsquo;s declared enemies) for their aggression, even
if such binaries reinforce women&rsquo;s oppression. Here, fascist
groups come to replace the parents as the external authority figures
who dictate how to think and act.</p>

<p>
Another Austrian American psychoanalytic feminist, Claudia Leeb, in
her <em>Contesting the Far Right: A Psychoanalytic and Feminist
Critical Theory Approach</em> (2024), draws on Freud&rsquo;s theory of
mass psychology and adds an analysis of capitalism to explain the
recruitment tactics of the far right today. As outlined above, the ego
ideal is the ideal view we have about ourselves and what we aspire to
be like. In capitalist societies, economic, interpersonal, and bodily
success standards create our ego ideal. However, objective conditions
of suffering in precarity capitalism, the inability to get or keep a
job, growing exploitation, alienation, and isolation make it
difficult, if not impossible, for most people to live up to such
standards. Therefore, objective conditions of suffering in capitalism
generate subjective forms of suffering in people around their
non-whole subjectivities, which they experience as a tension between
their ego and their ego ideal with accompanying castration anxieties
and feelings of failure.</p>

<p>
Far-right propaganda catches such suffering people because it allows
them to undo the tension between their ego and their ego ideal. Once
the ego coincides again with the ego ideal, they experience an
&ldquo;ecstatic high&rdquo; that allows them in a dream-like and
hallucinatory manner to feel as a &ldquo;whole&rdquo; subject again
and believe that they achieved economic, interpersonal, and bodily
success, which allows them to get rid of feelings of castration
anxiety and failure. Meanwhile, the objective conditions of suffering
in capitalism that generated their subjective forms of suffering in
the first place remain intact or become further entrenched by the far
right. Leeb also shows that white men from all classes are especially
vulnerable to psychologically oriented far-right recruitment tactics
because we expect them to live up to success standards, which has
become (despite their white, male and bourgeois privileges) difficult
to accomplish for them in precarity capitalism. The same psychological
processes that make the followers feel &ldquo;whole&rdquo; again also
engender a regression to a hypnotic state, where their unconscious
attitude predominates, and they subordinate themselves to the
destructive will of the leader or the movement.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the psychological processes that allow the followers to
undo the tension between their ego and their ego ideal also put their
super-ego, which is the mental instance in us that keeps our repressed
libidinal and aggressive drives in check, temporarily (or for
prolonged periods) out of action. The far right utilizes the libidinal
drive to strengthen the libidinal ties between the mass followers and
the leader and redirects the followers&rsquo; aggression towards its
chosen foes (migrants, and immigrants). Both processes allow for the
integration of individuals into the far-right mass. Leeb shows that in
a far-right mass with an identifiable leader, the followers undo the
split between their ego and their ego ideal by replacing their ego
ideal with the idealized leader figure. In contrast, in a far-right
mass without an identifiable leader figure, the movement&rsquo;s use
of specific propaganda techniques (such as racist and sexist jokes,
which she explains via Freud&rsquo;s critical theory of tendentious
jokes outlined above) fulfills a similar function.</p>

<h2 id="LacaPsyc">3. Lacanian Psychoanalysis</h2>

<p>
In considering the background of psychoanalytic feminism, a large
portion of which is rooted in or aligned with what is called French
Feminism (which I will discuss below), the French context of
psychoanalytic theory is also crucial, particularly the work of
Jacques Lacan. Lacan characterizes his work as fundamentally a return
to Freud, albeit one that brings the insights of structural
linguistics, especially Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson, and
structural anthropology, primarily Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss, into
the domain of psychoanalysis. Even so, his returns are also revisions;
he not only retrieves but renovates Freud&rsquo;s central
concepts.</p>

<p>
To better understand the feminist appropriation of Lacanian theory, I
will concentrate on outlining the imaginary, the symbolic and the
real, which are the three core theoretical concepts or domains through
which Lacan mapped his thought. Lacan focused his early works on
elaborating the imaginary. Starting from his Rome address &ldquo;The
Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis&rdquo;
(1953), Lacan shifted to explaining the symbolic. From <em>The Ethics
of Psychoanalysis</em> (1986), he engaged more deeply with the real.
However, it would be misguided to assume a chronology of these
concepts since Lacan returned and reworked them. Whereas the imaginary
relation refers to the relation between the ego and images, the
symbolic domain refers to the relation between the subject and
signifiers &ndash; language and speech. While the advent of the
symbolic order is tied to Oedipalization, and the imaginary order is
tied to the pre-Oedipal period, it would be mistaken to think of the
imaginary and symbolic in only developmental or chronological terms as
they are also ongoing structures of experience.</p>

<p>
The imaginary order is elucidated in Lacan&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;The
Mirror Stage as Formative of the I Function as Revealed in
Psychoanalytic Experience.&rdquo; The mirror stage commences
pre-Oedipally, between the age of six and eighteen months, before the
beginning of articulate speech. The subject (or the infant) is at this
age without speech, bodily coordination or motor control, and the
capacity for self-care. The mirror stage is the original adventure
where the subject finds, for the first time, what Lacan calls
&ldquo;an imaginary mastery&rdquo; over the body (Lacan, 1975a [1991a:
79]). This mastery is imaginary because it is premature in relation to
real mastery. The subject, who experiences her body at this stage as
&ldquo;disconnected, discordant, in pieces,&rdquo; finds an
anticipatory mastery via identification with an idealized
&ldquo;whole&rdquo; image of an other with a small o (<em>autre</em>,
symbolized as a&rsquo;), which is both the subject&rsquo;s own image
in the mirror and the image of a fellow human being (Lacan 1978
[1991b: 50]). Lacan distinguishes this other with a small o from the
big Other with a capital O (<em>Autre</em>, symbolized as A), the
symbolic domain.</p>

<p>
The mirror stage is the original adventure that allows the subject
through identification with an other, for the first time, the
experience of &ldquo;conceiving of [her/]himself as other than [s/]he
is,&rdquo; which Lacan underlines with the statement that in the
imaginary the &ldquo;I is an other (<em>Je est un autre</em>)&rdquo;
(Lacan 1978 [1991b: 7]). However, the mirror stage is not merely a
stage in the development of the subject. Instead, for Lacan the
relation of the ego to the other is an essential structure of the
human constitution, because &ldquo;there is always something of that
[the non-wholeness] that remains&rdquo; (Lacan 1978 [1991b: 50]). The
mirror stage means that the subject cannot achieve a whole ego via the
identification with an other with a small o. Instead, on the imaginary
plane, we are confronted with the fundamental precariousness of the
subject&rsquo;s ego, which threatens to dissolve at any moment. As
Lacan puts it, the ego is merely an &ldquo;ideal unity, which is never
attained as such and escapes him at every moment&rdquo; (Lacan 1978
[1991b: 20]). This fundamental precariousness has consequences for
both the subject and the other.</p>

<p>
On the side of the subject, we find the subject&rsquo;s continuing
attempts to reach an impossible wholeness through successive
identifications with an idealized whole other with a small o, which
builds up a rigid ego with a &ldquo;donned armor of an alienating
identity&rdquo; (Lacan 1966 [2006: 6]). Since the subject is in a
state of dependence relative to an idealized, forced image of itself
(the mirror image) or the image of another human being, the notion of
an &ldquo;autonomous ego&rdquo; is merely a deception on the imaginary
plane, where alienation prevails. The mirror stage also forms the
basis of Lacan&rsquo;s critique of ego psychology; whereas the latter
takes strengthening the ego to be the aim of analytic practice, Lacan
takes the aspirations of the ego to be a &ldquo;lure&rdquo; of
self-possession, an armor that rigidifies the subject, a defensive
structure that provides an alienating identity.</p>

<p>
Yet it is not only the subject for whom the imaginary relation results
in alienation. It is also the other, the fellow human being, from whom
the subject expects to find her wholeness, who suffers in the
imaginary relation. The central Lacanian statement that &ldquo;the ego
is the other, and the other is me (<em>moi</em>)&rdquo; means that the
subject, in her attempt to reach an impossible wholeness via
identification with an other, reduces the other to itself, which leads
to destruction and a negation of the other (Lacan 1978 [1991b: 95].
Because the ego is the other in the imaginary, the other needs to be
reduced to me to sustain the illusion of a whole.</p>

<p>
In the imaginary domain, we also encounter the narcissistic character
of love relationships where the other is reduced to the functions of
the ego: &ldquo;It is one&rsquo;s own ego that one loves in love,
one&rsquo;s own ego made real on the imaginary level&rdquo; (Lacan
1975a [1991a: 62&ndash;3]. He also outlines an aggressive tension as
the result of the narcissistic structure of the
&ldquo;coming-into-being of the subject&rdquo; via the other. Since
the wholeness of the subject comes about via a foreign idealized whole
image of an other, aggression is the irreducible accompaniment of the
relation of the I to the other, which easily turns into
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either me or you.&rdquo; Since any departure from
the idealized &ldquo;whole&rdquo; through which the subject finds her
imaginary wholeness threatens to destroy the subject, the other must
remain reduced to me (Lacan 1966 [2006: 22]).</p>

<p>
However, the imaginary relation is not merely a stage in the
development of the subject. Instead, since the subject will never be
completely unified precisely because this is brought about in an
alienating way, in the form of a foreign image, Lacan argues,
&ldquo;[t]he aggressive tension of this either me or the other is
entirely integrated into every kind of imaginary functioning in
[wo]man&rdquo; (Lacan 1981 [1993: 95]). Therefore, whenever we find
ourselves on the imaginary plane, we encounter an aggressive tension
between the subject and the other. The good news that Lacan brings us
is that it never gets to the point of radical destruction. There is
always something else that intervenes in the imaginary relation.</p>

<p>
At this point that we encounter the Lacanian big Other, the symbolic
domain. Whereas on the imaginary plane, the subject identifies with a
whole idealized image of an other, in the symbolic order she
identifies with a symbol, the signifier, which allows her a certain
consistency and stability. In the symbolic order, the subject, not the
ego, is born. Therefore, the subject can set herself up as
&ldquo;operating, as human, as I, from the moment the symbolic system
appears&rdquo; (Lacan 1978 [1991b: 52]. Lacan argues that the symbolic
order is the result of generations and was there long before we came
into the world. Therefore, for individuals to become subjects, they
have to submit to it, much more than they constitute it.</p>

<p>
The problem for Lacan is that the symbolic order consists of
signifiers that subjects have erected as fixed. Such a rigid symbolic
order has consequences for the subject, who has to submit to the
symbolic order to become a subject. Since the signifier &ldquo;governs
whatever may be made present in the subject&rdquo; (Lacan 1973 [1977:
198], a signifier that has been erected as a fixed entity allows
certain aspects to be made present in the subject but not others. As a
consequence, for the subject to become a subject, she needs to
suppress all those other aspects that the signifier denies. At the
moment when the subject emerges via her subjection to the signifier,
the unconscious makes its appearance as that which could not be made
present in the subject, because the signifier forecloses it.</p>

<p>
In Book XI, Lacan explains subject formation with the double function
of the signifier that &ldquo;functions as a signifier only to reduce
the subject in question to no more than a signifier, to petrify the
subject in the same movement in which it calls the subject to
function, to speak, as subject&rdquo; (Lacan 1973 [1977: 207]). For
example, identification with the signifier &ldquo;woman&rdquo; allows
an individual to function and to speak as a &ldquo;woman.&rdquo;
However, this solidification into a signifier is, according to Lacan,
especially problematic for women, since the signifier
&ldquo;woman&rdquo; is linked to a whole chain of signifiers in
patriarchy &ndash; including the body, the object, passivity and so
on. &ldquo;Speech remains,&rdquo; he warns us: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
help the play of symbols, and that is why you must be very careful
what you say.&rdquo; (Lacan 1978 [1991b: 198]). The problem is that
subjects are very careful about what they say, especially regarding
women. Lacan elucidates this in relation to the androcentric character
of the symbolic order, which for him is unacceptable precisely because
women &ldquo;are entirely subjected to it [the symbolic order] no less
than the men&rdquo; (Lacan 1978 [1991b: 262]).</p>

<p>
Although the signifier &ldquo;woman&rdquo; (and &ldquo;man&rdquo;) is
like all signifiers, empty and merely deceiving us over what there is
to signify, this signifier exists and determines what can be made
present in women. Lacan argues that fixed signifiers lead to the
petrified pain of subjects who must submit to these signifiers to
become subjects. Although the symbolic order allows the subject a
certain consistency and stability (which is precarious in the
imaginary), Lacan insists that this identification with the signifier
still does not allow the subject to become entirely whole either.
Although the &ldquo;signifier alone guarantees the theoretical
coherence of the whole as a whole,&rdquo; this coherence is only
theoretical (Lacan 1966 [2006: 25]). Since the signifier itself is
always non-whole, any identification with it results in a non-whole or
fundamentally lacking subject.</p>

<p>
Here, we have arrived at the third domain that Lacan introduces
&ndash; the domain of the real. The real does not refer to any
reality. On the contrary, it tells us we can never reach such a
reality. The real is linked to the imaginary and the symbolic, but it
is neither symbolic nor imaginary. Its constitution lies at the
juncture of the symbolic and the imaginary. The real is an element in
the symbolic that resists absolute symbolization. As he puts it, the
real tells us that there is &ldquo;a fault, a hole&rdquo; in the big
Other (the symbolic order) and its signifiers (1975b [1998]: 28). The
real is the gap, the unnameable, and the limit of discourse and the
fissure in the symbolic order that points to that which is beyond
meaning.</p>

<p>
Although the signifier in the symbolic order brings the subject into
being (through identification with the signifier), the signifier can
never completely determine our subjectivity because there is a hole in
the big Other. Furthermore, because there is a fundamental hole in the
signifier, the subject remains &ldquo;a subject-with-holes&rdquo;
(<em>sujet trou&eacute;</em>) in the symbolic order, which Lacan
considers as a traumatic moment (1973 [1977]: 182). Remaining a
subject-with-holes creates desires (the desire for wholeness) and
anxieties (the anxiety of never reaching any wholeness). Here, Lacan
introduces the concept of <em>objet petit a</em> (&ldquo;object little
a&rdquo;), which is the historically contingent unconscious fantasy
object through which we obtain the illusion of wholeness.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, throughout his &ldquo;Seminar on Feminine
Sexuality&rdquo; Lacan makes the puzzling statement that &ldquo;there
is no such thing as a sexual relationship&rdquo; (Lacan 1975b [1998:
7, 47, 61&ndash;2]). This statement does not refer to the
impossibility of sexual relations as such, as Luce Irigaray (who will
be discussed below) has argued, but to the impossibility of stating
what sexual difference implies. In the Lacanian schema of sexuation,
sexual difference stands for the real, which implies that every
attempt to define &ldquo;woman&rdquo; via a set of
&ldquo;static&rdquo; symbolic oppositions to &ldquo;man&rdquo; (such
as active/passive) always refers to a surplus, something that does not
fit into this opposition. In Book XI, he argues that the
&ldquo;masculine/feminine opposition is never attained&rdquo; and that
there is, as such, &ldquo;nothing by which the subject may situate
[her/]himself as a male or female being&rdquo; (Lacan 1973 [1977: 192,
204]).</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious,&rdquo; a
chapter in <em>Ecrits</em>, Lacan illustrates the impossibility of
reducing sexual difference to binary oppositions grounded in some
&ldquo;real&rdquo; properties. Explaining the &ldquo;laws of urinary
segregation,&rdquo; which refers here to the gendered separation of
toilets, Lacan replaces the Saussurian scheme of a single signifier
(the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; above the bar) and the signified (the
drawing of a tree below the bar) with a pair of signifiers: we see two
words (&ldquo;ladies&rdquo; and &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo;) next to each
other above a bar (signifying sexual difference) (Lacan 1966 [2006:
143]).</p>

<p>
The surprise here is that, below the bar, we see two identical
drawings of a door. This illustration underlines that sexual
difference does not designate any &ldquo;real&rdquo; oppositions
between the sexes. Instead, it refers to a purely symbolic opposition
to which nothing corresponds in the designated objects but the real
(the bar), which the image of the signified cannot ever capture. For
Lacan (similarly to Freud), there is, for example, no reason to say
that the woman is passive and the man is active. In the Lacanian
sense, this is not discernible so long as the definitions are not laid
down.</p>

<p>
However, sexed oppositions have an effect on reality, which Lacan
explains with the story of a girl and a boy who arrive in a train at a
station. They are seated across from each other in a train compartment
next to the outside window that provides a view of the platform
buildings going by. The moment the train stops the boy says,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Look&hellip;we&rsquo;re at Ladies!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Imbecile!&rsquo; replies the girl, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
we&rsquo;re at Gentlemen&rsquo;&rdquo; (Lacan 1966 [2006: 143]). The
signifier of sexual difference (ladies and gentlemen) fails to signify
any &ldquo;real&rdquo; difference between the girl and the boy (the
signified). However, from now on the girl and the boy have to find
their bearing therein, which, precisely because it is impossible to
say what this difference is, will, according to Lacan, raise
dissension between the sexes &ldquo;to the immeasurable power of
ideological warfare&rdquo; (Lacan 1966 [2006: 144]). Since it is
impossible for the ones signified (the boy and the girl) to agree upon
what these terms &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; and &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo;
imply or to reach up to their significations, the hegemonic struggle
for determining the signifier&rsquo;s meanings is opened up.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;The Signification of the Phallus,&rdquo; Lacan also
addresses and criticizes the alternative view to Freud&rsquo;s
argument that there is only one masculine libido &ndash; that there
might be two libidos, which he satirizes as a kind of sexual equality
that essentializes masculinity and femininity (Lacan 1966 [2006:
577]). Lacan also criticizes the idea that in the final stage of
genital sexuality, men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s sexual interests
converge, and points out that Freud understood &ldquo;the essential
disturbance of human sexuality&rdquo; (1966 [2006: 575]). Such
disturbance means that there is no symmetrical or harmonious sexual
relation between well-integrated and self-realized men and women.
However, we encounter in Lacan also gendered metaphors. For example,
in his early works, he declares that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such
thing as Woman, Woman with a capital W indicating the universal&rdquo;
(1975b [1998: 72]).</p>

<p>
Here he asserts that the signifier &ldquo;woman&rdquo; does not imply
any determinate or substantive content. Symbolic representations leave
something out and produce an impasse that presents a fracture or
fissure in the symbolic order. Although Lacan aims to show us here
that sexual difference cannot be fully contained within its terms, it
remains a problem that it is &ldquo;woman&rdquo; who is associated
with the domain of the real, which he also associates with lack.</p>

<p>
Gendered metaphors also appear in his elaboration of the symbolic
domain. Lacan points out that Freud&rsquo;s theory of sexuality
anticipates a theory of signification that he could not yet elaborate.
Following the logic of <em>Totem and Taboo</em>, social bonds are
maintained through mandates and prohibitions (what is required and
what is forbidden), and in particular through the mandate of exogamy
which determines that &ldquo;the Oedipus complex is both universal and
contingent&rdquo; (Lacan 1978 [1991b: 33]). For Lacan, paternal
prohibition provides the conditions for human sociality without the
prohibition itself being innate.</p>

<p>
Lacan calls the paternal prohibition (the incest taboo) the &ldquo;law
of the father,&rdquo; and he develops the connection between law and
language by way of a pun. In French, <em>non</em> (&ldquo;no&rdquo;)
and <em>nom</em> (&ldquo;name&rdquo;) sound alike. The
&ldquo;no&rdquo; that prohibits (the father&rsquo;s law) and the name
that establishes authority (the father&rsquo;s name or the proper
name), are conferred simultaneously. By submitting to the law of the
father (his no and name) the child becomes a subject, bound by law and
bearer of language. With this compliance, the child takes on a life of
desire and incompletion, pursuing lost objects with no firm ground or
fixed purpose, a lack of plenitude in being that Lacan designates as
castration.</p>

<p>
As discussed above in the section on Freud, Freud understands women to
be &ldquo;castrated,&rdquo; deprived of a penis, and men to live under
the threat of castration. Lacan complicates this perspective by
deeming all subjects to be castrated, by which he means deprived of
the phallus, which is not the same as the penis. While the penis is a
biological organ, the phallus is a signifier, not an image or bodily
organ, and in relation to it, all are castrated. According to Lacan,
the phallus instates the signifier into the subject regardless of any
&ldquo;anatomical distinction between the sexes&rdquo; (Lacan 1966
[2006: 576]). Lacan also challenges Freud&rsquo;s idea of
women&rsquo;s &ldquo;penis-envy&rdquo; and asserts that it is
&ldquo;in so far as the woman is in the symbolic order with an
androcentric perspective that the penis takes on this value. Besides,
it isn&rsquo;t the penis, but the phallus&rdquo; (Lacan 1978 [1991b:
272)].</p>

<p>
Here, Lacan de-biologizes Freud since he articulates the function of
the phallus apart from any particular bodily attributes. Castration
takes place when the child recognizes lack in the mother, and her
maternal omnipotence is annulled. The mother, for the child, ceases to
be the all-powerful provider of every satisfaction as she herself is a
desiring being deprived of satisfaction (Lacan 1966 [2006: 582]).
Galvanized by the mother&rsquo;s lack, the law of the father takes the
place of the mother&rsquo;s desire, substitutes for it and occludes
it. In the Lacanian version of the Oedipal Complex, human beings
achieve a sexual position by traversing the Oedipal Complex, i.e., by
submitting to castration, also called the phallic function, and
thereby entering into the symbolic domain.</p>

<p>
The father&rsquo;s &ldquo;No&rdquo; effectively says to the child:
&ldquo;you are not the object of the mother&rsquo;s desire&rdquo; or
&ldquo;you are not her phallus, the thing that fulfills her.&rdquo; As
such, it also conveys the message that the child too, is lacking or
desiring. Lacan distinguishes between a &ldquo;seeming to be&rdquo;
which characterizes femininity, in the attempt to be the phallus that
one is not (to be the object of desire), from a &ldquo;seeming to
have&rdquo; which characterizes masculinity in the attempt to have the
phallus that one does not have (to possess the object of desire).
However, he still maintains that everyone is lacking the phallus in
some way, either in the mode of not being it or in the mode of not
having it.</p>

<p>
In his later works, Lacan equates the &ldquo;phallus&rdquo; with the
real. Here, he reiterates that the phallus does not denote any
positive meaning. Rather, it signifies the moment when meaning
&ldquo;slips ways, runs off, escapes all those barriers that oppose
it, including precisely those that are the most essential, those that
are constituted by the agency of the signifier&rdquo; (Lacan 1986
[1992]: 314). For Lacan, the phallus is fallible, which he underlines
by equating the phallus with the bar (which refers to the real)
between the signifier and the signified. Furthermore, in his Seminar
on X on anxiety, Lacan links the phallus to anxiety (Lacan 2004
[2016]). Here explains that the fact that the phallus is not found
where we expect and require it to be and that it merely appears as
lack underlines that sexuality is linked with anxiety. Insofar as we
expect men to have the phallus, which signifies lack, it is
particularly men who are plagued with anxieties around their
sexuality.</p>

<p>
The Slovenian psychoanalytic feminist thinker Renata Salecl points out
that although the phallus is on the side of men in Lacan&rsquo;s work,
men cannot be happy about that because the phallus refers to an image
whose reality is its incompleteness, which creates anxieties in men
who are expected to have the phallus (Salecl 2002). Elizabeth Grosz
further explains that the incompleteness of the phallus, which we
demand from men to have, generates men&rsquo;s &ldquo;anxieties about
sexual performance (impotence fears) as well as a sometimes desperate
search for the other through whom the man can have his position as the
possessor of the valued/desired organ confirmed&rdquo; (Grosz 1990:
118).</p>

<p>
Despite Lacan&rsquo;s attempts to de-essentialize the meaning of the
phallus and feminist attempts to read the phallus as the impossibility
of signifying sexual difference, Lacan remains implicated in the
symbolic order with an androcentric perspective (or a certain
&ldquo;phallogocentrism&rdquo; as outlined by French psychoanalytic
feminists, as we shall see in the next section) since the phallus
retains its associations with masculinity and remains the focal point
of sexual identity. Nonetheless, feminist thinkers have also found
fruitful resources in Lacan&rsquo;s theoretical framework to rethink
sexual difference, and the meaning of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;femininity.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="FrenFemi">4. French Feminism</h2>

<p>
French Feminism is in many ways a misnomer since the authors thus
characterized are rarely of French origin or nationality (although
French is the predominant language of their writing) and not
necessarily overtly self-identified as feminist. The writers
affiliated with French Feminism, including Luce Irigaray, Julia
Kristeva, Sarah Kofman, Catherine Cl&eacute;ment, and
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous, among others, variously ask about the
relation between the maternal and the feminine, doubt that we can say
what a woman is, worry about Freud&rsquo;s lack of attention to
mothers, play with writing style, wonder about feminine subjectivity,
ask if women can be subjects or citizens without adapting to masculine
norms, challenge Lacan&rsquo;s phallocentrism, and suspect that access
to language assimilates women into neutralized brothers.</p>

<p>
They are sympathetic to the split of subjectivity detailed by
psychoanalysis and ask whether the structures of femininity and the
structures of subjectivity are compatible, commensurable,
reconcilable, and they are vexed by the apprehension that they are
fundamentally at odds. While they aim to disentangle femininity from
maternity and provide a critique of their conflation, they also take
seriously the significance of maternity for women and for children of
both sexes. Because they take femininity and the feminine body as
points of departure for speech and writing, they have often been
accused of essentialism. The focus below is on the work of Irigaray
and Kristeva, examining how they engage with and transform the ideas
of Freud and Lacan and how they articulate sexual difference as
integrally connected to the foundation and disruption of the symbolic
order.</p>

<h3 id="ImpaFemiSubj">4.1 The Impasse of Feminine Subjectivity</h3>

<p>
Irigaray characterizes her own project as taking place in three
stages: first, deconstructing the masculine subject; second, figuring
out the possibility for a feminine subject; and third, construing an
intersubjectivity that respects sexual difference (Irigaray 1995a:
96). Sexual difference, in her view, is not a system of domination to
be overcome but a cultural process and practice to be achieved and
nourished; the actual relations of domination and subordination that
characterize Western politics, society, history, literature, language,
and law epitomize for Irigaray the reign of sexual indifference, the
fraternal order of equal brothers/citizens that is inattentive to
sexual differentiation. Irigaray&rsquo;s writings implicate Freud in
this culture of sexual indifference, as will be elaborated further
below.</p>

<p>
Irigaray&rsquo;s writing style is often mimetic, an approach that she
claims has been &ldquo;historically assigned to the feminine&rdquo;
(Irigaray 1977 [1985b: 76]). Irigaray&rsquo;s writing does not proceed
propositionally, laying down theses and supporting arguments, nor is
it formulated through conventionally linear explanations. Instead, she
reaches her insights and conclusions by mirroring the text she is
reading, allowing it to play out its contradictions, and putting its
parapraxes (its textual and conceptual slips of the tongue) on
display. By exposing the unconscious logic of a text, and revealing
the author&rsquo;s underlying fantasies and anxieties, she aims to
loosen the masculine hold on the symbolic order. Intently attentive to
the signifier, to the words and silences of psychoanalytic texts, she
aims to retrieve the bodily in language and to invent a new language
and imagine new forms.</p>

<p>
<em>Speculum of the Other Woman</em> (her dissertation and the work
that got her exiled from the Lacanian school) includes &ldquo;The
Blind Spot of an Old Dream of Symmetry,&rdquo; Irigaray&rsquo;s long
essay on Freud&rsquo;s writings on femininity. Irigaray&rsquo;s essay
on Freud begins by tackling head-on his articulation of the riddle of
femininity in his lecture on &ldquo;Femininity&rdquo; (Irigaray 1974
[1985a: 13]). Here already, we can recognize not only Irigaray&rsquo;s
unique style and her critical project but also the way these two
features of her writing are imbricated and entangled with one another,
propelling a distinctively mimetic method of reading, repeating, and
reproducing the text, mirroring Freud&rsquo;s speculative discourse
but also transforming and sabotaging its terms.</p>

<p>
Her text opens with Freud&rsquo;s words, and is comprised of long
quotations that follow the course of Freud&rsquo;s essay. Insofar as
this appropriation might at first appear as the passive listening of a
dutiful daughter, Irigaray performs a kind of masquerade of
femininity: receptive, submissive, obedient. But this performance does
not merely reiterate or reproduce; in exemplifying the ways in which
women have no language of their own, and can only speak in or through
the voice of the father, she is establishing the symbolic terrain upon
which any critique must move while also subverting its
presuppositions. Her words are inserted as commentary, question, and
counterpoint, breaking open the Freudian text, usurping its
privileges, and revealing its wounds. By engaging Freud in a
conversation, she insists on her status as a speaking subject.</p>

<p>
Although Freud&rsquo;s lecture had ventured to complicate rather than
simplify certainties concerning sexual difference, Irigaray, however,
by retrieving and replaying Freud&rsquo;s voice, attempts to show that
he remains caught up in certainties about sex, so that ultimately, his
discourse is one of sexual indifference. Freud&rsquo;s work is
sexually indifferent because of its assumption of a kind of symmetry
or harmony between masculine and feminine identities and sexualities.
With regard to sexual desire, Freud assumes that &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
women will desire men and be desired by them and thus that each sex
can fulfill the longings of the other.</p>

<p>
Irigaray suggests that with regard to sexual identity, Freud models
the feminine Oedipal Complex on a masculine origin and paradigm, with
the feminine as its distorted copy. Freud understands women as the
complementary other to men, an other modeled on the same. Irigaray
considers this to be a monosexual, homosocial economy governed by
specular opposition or mirroring. The speculum is a metaphor for the
mirror that reflects male-centric philosophy, psychoanalysis, and
culture, which positions women and the feminine as mere distorted and
lacking images of the masculine norm, rather than individuals with a
genuine feminine subjectivity. She references this sexual indifference
in the title of her essay as &ldquo;the old dream of symmetry.&rdquo;
Irigaray believes this dream is premised on a &ldquo;blindspot&rdquo;
- Freud characterizes the girl&rsquo;s relation to the maternal figure
as an &ldquo;especially inexorable repression&rdquo; (Freud 1931
[1968: 226]) and views the little girl as a little man.</p>

<p>
Irigaray suggests that the mother/daughter relation is not seen or
apprehended by Freud. The crime here, in her view, is matricide and
the suppression of maternal genealogies or lines of descent. The law
of the father, the patrimonial order by which sons inherit the
father&rsquo;s name by submitting to his prohibitions, privileging
this name over the maternal body, appropriates even birth to the
father. The maternal lineage is suppressed. Irigaray argues that this
means that a pre-Oedipal mother-daughter relationship has not been
taken up by the signifying order; in fact that order retroactively
denies that such a relation ever existed, since a daughter becomes
sexually differentiated (as a girl or woman) only post-Oedipally.</p>

<p>
In Lacanian terms, Freud excludes the mother/daughter relation from
the symbolic order. Not only is the maternal connection lost or
repressed but the ability to name or identify the loss as a loss is
also barred. Banished from memory, the loss of the mother cannot be
mourned. Irigaray claims that it is this genealogical asymmetry, with
the father&rsquo;s name memorialized and the mother&rsquo;s body
sacrificed to it, that sustains the legitimacy of patriarchy and
propels the fantasy of a harmony of sexual difference, the conviction
that the sexes are reciprocal and complementary in their identities
and desires.</p>

<p>
Sexual difference, in Irigaray&rsquo;s reading of Freud, is thus
subsumed under or derived from &ldquo;the problematics of
sameness&rdquo; (Irigaray 1974 [1985a: 26]) that is not threatened by
any real difference. Freud&rsquo;s account of sexuality presupposes
that the sexual subject is male, that there are no women, only mothers
or those destined to become mothers, and that the meaning of being a
woman is fully exhausted in the meaning of being a mother. In the
psychical pre-history of the little girl as elaborated in the idea
that &ldquo;the little girl is a little man&rdquo; (Freud 1933 [1968:
118]), she will not have been a daughter.</p>

<p>
As little girls diverge from little boys, as they cease to be little
men, they are expected to be appealing visual objects, the mirror of
men&rsquo;s desires, enabling men to represent themselves and shore up
their self-image with an adoring reflection. Irigaray sees in this
account a masculine desire for women&rsquo;s desire to be directed
toward men. Women are expected to provide the mirror that supports
men&rsquo;s projects, nurtures and nourishes their identities, and
energizes their drive for mastery by presenting themselves as an alter
ego. This imaginary, specular, order is matricidal, feeding on the
blood of women, leaving unpaid its fundamental debt to the mother, and
abandoning the subjectivity of the daughter.</p>

<p>
Irigaray&rsquo;s concern is that for Freud, the mother is only a
mirror, and her relationship is always with a son; there are no
mother/daughter relations. Not only is Western culture premised on
matricide, which she claims is more primordial than the patricide of
<em>Totem and Taboo</em>, but this matricide is forgotten and the
mother remains unmourned. Repressing any maternal genealogy, political
life has been predicated on the lineage between fathers and sons and
the bonds of brotherhood, appropriating universality and citizenship
to men and rendering women as objects of their desire and exchange.
The exploitation of women is not merely a phenomenon that takes place
within the social order; it is its very foundation and premise.</p>

<p>
Irigaray calls the fraternal order &ldquo;hom(m)osexuality,&rdquo;
meaning both that it is an order of the same (<em>homo-</em>) and that
it is the order of men (<em>homme</em>): the regime of sexual
indifference ignores relations among women, and especially between
mothers and daughters, and situates women as the medium of men&rsquo;s
alliances with one another, as the buried support and energetic
reserves of the body politic. This forgetting of the mother supports
vertical and horizontal relations between men but leaves women
unrepresented in language (as subjects) and incapable of achieving
representation in the body politic (as citizens).</p>

<p>
Thus Irigaray&rsquo;s project aims to criticize the hom(m)osexual
order and its specular economy, reinvigorate mother/daughter relations
to make possible a feminine subjectivity, and cultivate sexual
difference in the political realm. Developing the resources for
transformation, i.e., for women to become citizens and subjects,
entails disrupting the transmission of power between men and
rethinking the passage from nature to culture represented by the
Oedipal Complex. This task requires intervening in the symbolic and
imaginary realms, creating a new language that would not be severed
from the body.</p>

<p>
For Irigaray, the association of subjectivity with masculinity
precludes the convergence of being a woman and being a speaking being.
Although there are words for women, these words constitute her only
with reference to masculinity, as a photographic negative of man, or
in response to a patriarchal exertion of feminine norms and
expectations. They secure her in a masculine universe, they say in
advance what she is, they render her captive to an idea of feminine
essence. By contrast, Irigaray seeks to create a representation for
women that would not be a designation of what she is, defining her by
and holding her to some concrete essence, but would allow her to exist
on her terms and speak for herself.</p>

<p>
By acquiescing, in her mimetic writing style, to the cultural
expectation of feminine artifice, Irigaray stages her exiled agency
and thereby extends the possibilities for being a woman to include
being not only an object in or reference of language but a transformer
of language. Without claiming to say what a woman really is, to get
right what the symbolic order gets wrong, she shows that in speaking
differently, the very meaning of being a woman (or being a man) can be
transformed, so that sexual difference remains open to new
possibilities. She thus does not so much refute Freud&rsquo;s account
of the Oedipal Complex and the little girl&rsquo;s purported
masculinity as re-present its primal crime against women, the Oedipal
exclusion of maternal dependency, thereby altering the scene of its
representation.</p>

<p>
Irigaray also challenges the Lacanian idea of the law of the father
and the phallic signifier, pillorying the way in which natural birth
has been assigned to maternity while cultural birth is assigned to
paternity, equating the woman-mother with body and the man-father with
language and law, and relegating the bodily process of parturition
(maternity) to mute nature while valorizing the symbolic process of
legitimation (paternity) as constitutive of civilization. Human
subjectivity has been masculinized, while human flesh is both
feminized and animalized. Irigaray aims to provoke a legitimation
crisis in the paternal legacy and the name of the father that bestows
on the child a political and familial identity.</p>

<p>
Challenging the logic of the one, Irigaray takes the self-division of
nature, its being-two, as a model of self-development. When Irigaray
says that human nature is two, she means not that there are two fixed
sexual substances, but that to be natural is to be embodied, finite,
and divided, and that the fundamental character of human nature is
growth through differentiation. If human nature is two, and always
divided, Irigaray argues, then civil identity is also two and divided;
the two of nature need to be brought into the two of culture. The one
is an illusion of patriarchy, while the two threaten the phallocentric
order and challenge the supposition that universality must be
singular.</p>

<p>
The idea of feminine subjectivity means that the universal must be
doubled. Doubling the universal does not, for Irigaray, mean merely
replacing a neutral universality with two wholly distinct and separate
truths. A universal that has been doubled has also been split or
divided from itself, no longer one. Irigaray sees in the doubled
universal the possibility of overcoming a culture of sexual
indifference and cultivating sexual difference. However, her
affirmation of sexual difference does not mean affirming the feminine
traits that have been ascribed to women, since these are the traits of
sexual indifference, defined only with reference to men. Sexual
difference has yet to appear, and it is her task to bring it into
being.</p>

<p>
Among many others, Jessica Benjamin (whose work will be discussed
below) seems to share the view that Irigaray&rsquo;s theoretical
project is premised upon valorizing &ldquo;female genitals as a
starting point for a different desire&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988: 276). No
doubt this (mis)interpretation stems from Irigaray&rsquo;s text
&ldquo;When Our Lips Speak Together&rdquo; (Irigaray 1976 [1980]). But
what Irigaray means by &ldquo;speaking from the body&rdquo; is moving
away from a singular conception of origin and desire, and most
especially the origin of desire. Her writing of women&rsquo;s bodies,
like her retrieval of mother/daughter genealogies, is a strategy of
language and imagination, situating the body as a fluid border, the
site of the overflow of culture into nature and vice versa, rather
than a self-enclosed egoic center. She is not an essentialist who
views women&rsquo;s biology as their destiny. Instead, she challenges
the nature/culture divide and the either/or of biology or
civilization.</p>

<p>
Similarly to Beauvoir, who ascertains that language and culture
constitute the subject as masculine, and the feminine as other to him,
Irigaray maintains that inhabiting a feminine subjectivity is
paradoxical in a fraternal social order. But, for Irigaray, both
Beauvoir and Freud fail to address sexual difference insofar as they
retain a singular notion of masculine subjectivity: Freud because he
presumes the libido is always masculine, and Beauvoir because she
considers the aim of women&rsquo;s emancipation to be equality with
men (for instance by concluding <em>The Second Sex</em> with a call to
brotherhood and seeming, arguably, to be calling for women to
assimilate to masculine norms of selfhood).</p>

<p>
Irigaray rejects the project of equality, since &ldquo;equality&rdquo;
can only ever mean equality to men, and proposes instead doubling the
notion of subjectivity in line with the subject&rsquo;s own
self-division. Women can have the rights of men only so long as they
are like men, i.e., insofar as they are brothers, subsumed into the
neutral individuality of the liberal social contract. This purportedly
equal access to citizenship and subjectivity thus does not resolve the
paradox, since it merely takes the side of subjectivity over that of
femininity, retaining the constitution of the feminine as lack, the
inverted image of man, the other of the same, that which stands in the
way of political agency and obstructs autonomy, and which thus must be
overcome in order to achieve self-determination. In the prevailing
social contract, femininity and subjectivity remain opposed.</p>

<p>
Irigaray does not think she can say what a woman is or what femininity
is. Familial, social, and symbolic mechanisms of exchange have denied
femininity its images and language, fashioning women through
men&rsquo;s language, images, and desires and thereby producing an
apparent but false symmetry within a single, monotonous language. And
although Irigaray often invokes the maternal as the source of life and
subjectivity, she does not equate maternity with femininity or the
mother with the woman. To find a language for feminine sexuality and
feminine subjectivity, we must go &ldquo;back through the dominant
discourse&rdquo; (Irigaray 1977 [1985b: 119]) with its metaphysical
assumptions of substance or essence, and its concept of identity which
adheres to the regime of sexual indifference.</p>

<p>
Against the homogeny of the dominant discourse, with its same and its
other, Irigaray construes the production or work of sexual difference
as a relation between-two, to be the path toward liberating both
femininity and masculinity from their metaphysical and political
constraints by allowing them each to cultivate their own
interdependent natures. The doubled, non-neutral, universal allows for
distinctively feminine (and distinctively masculine) subjects to
become citizen-subjects.</p>

<p>
The idea of a between-two does not mean a singular path that is shared
by both, but rather indicates, in addition to the value of a
specifically feminine sexual identity and a specifically masculine
sexual identity, the ethical path of an intersubjective relationality
that allows them to appreciate and value one another. Since the
between-two is premised on being-two (self-differentiated), it is in
the cultivation of this sexual difference that we will find the
possibility of an ethical sexual relation, what Irigaray calls an
ethics of sexual difference.</p>

<h3 id="SubjAlteAlie">4.2 Subjectivity, Alterity, and Alienation</h3>

<p>
While often grouped together in overviews of so-called French
Feminism, Irigaray and Kristeva have fundamentally disparate projects
(and locations in the academy), both with regard to their critical
analyses and with regard to their political enterprises. Whereas
Irigaray was a student of Lacan who breaks with (even as she is
inspired by) his teachings from her earliest work, Kristeva has a much
more ambiguous relationship to his school of thought and was never his
student or attended his seminars. Their respective views can perhaps
best be captured with respect to their attitude toward castration (the
Oedipal Complex) and the social contract. As explained above, Irigaray
envisions a sexuate culture that would overcome the Oedipal demands of
a sacrificial economy and restore feminine genealogies to the work of
civilization. Kristeva, by contrast, argues that there is no
subjectivity beyond sacrifice and does not believe that Oedipal
demands can or should be overcome.</p>

<p>
However, both attend to the body and the drives, taking up the theme
of loss or exile of the mother&rsquo;s body and the impact of
matricide on social relations. Kristeva even (echoing Irigaray)
condemns humanism as &ldquo;the fraternity of the same&rdquo;
(Kristeva 1998: 168) and, like Irigaray, she plays with writing style,
offering experimental, innovative, sometimes imagistic portraits of
psychical moods, maternal practices, and artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>
Kristeva&rsquo;s connection to feminist thought is also unsettled and
volatile, although her focus on questions pertaining to language,
femininity, and the maternal body has made her work amenable to
feminist interest and development. In her essay &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s
Time&rdquo; (1979 [1986]), she classifies the feminist movement into
three distinct times or generations, each with its own approach to
justice. The first generation is universalist in principle and aspires
to give women a place within history and the social contract; this
generation takes equality as its mission and asserts women&rsquo;s
identification with the dominant values of rationality. Kristeva
aligns Beauvoir with this project of pursuing access to universal
subjectivity.</p>

<p>
The second generation is reactive, rejecting the idea of assimilation
to values taken to be masculine; this generation insists on feminine
difference. While Kristeva does not mention Irigaray, it seems clear
that Kristeva would align her with this strategy and the project of
recognizing feminine specificity. In Kristeva&rsquo;s view, the first
generation is so committed to universal equality that it denies bodily
difference, and the second generation is so committed to difference
that it refuses to partake of a history it deems to be masculine. The
third generation follows neither the path of fixing identity nor the
path of neutralizing difference in the medium of universality.
Instead, it embraces ambiguity and non-identity respecting the
ineluctability of bodily difference.</p>

<p>
Since Kristeva believes that there is no subjectivity and no sociality
without the violence of the symbolic contract and the splitting of
subjectivity, the feminism that she proposes would not take refuge
from this violence either by standing outside history (as the second
generation does), or by denying women&rsquo;s bodies and desires (as
the first generation does). Taking seriously the intransigence of
sexual difference, and the fractures within identity, Kristeva
advocates feminist support for alienation that would not pretend to
reconcile the rupture between body and law (what Lacan calls
castration) and would refuse the solace of identity (which underlines
her affinity to third generation feminists.</p>

<p>
For example, Kristeva mentions the bodily experience of pregnancy, an
experience of being split, of being two in one, as manifesting the
instability of, and alterity within, identity. Her insistence on the
fragility and precariousness of identity can be grasped in the first
instance by looking at Kristeva&rsquo;s understanding of the drives
and language. Kristeva introduces the notion of the semiotic as the
affective dimension of language that facilitates its energetic
movement. The semiotic is the materiality of language, its tonal and
rhythmic qualities, and its bodily force. In Kristeva&rsquo;s account,
the drives are not simply excluded by language but also inscribed as
an alien element within it. While more basic than signification, the
semiotic participates in signifying practices.</p>

<p>
Kristeva&rsquo;s elaboration of the semiotic situates it at a point
prior to the Lacanian imaginary, i.e., prior to the moment at which
the infant identifies with its own mirror image ego or the image of an
other. Still in porous relation to another body, without clear borders
or limits, the infant is propelled by the anarchic, heterogeneous,
rhythmic flow of drive energy &ldquo;which has no thesis and no
position&rdquo; (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 26]). Mobile and provisional,
moving through the body of the not-yet subject, the semiotic is a
chaotic force anterior to language, unlocalizable because it courses
through an as-yet undifferentiated materiality in which the infantile
body is not yet distinct from the maternal body.</p>

<p>
Kristeva calls this stage pre-thetic since it is prior to the reign of
propositions, judgments, positions, and theses, these being subsequent
possibilities that might arrest or seize a movement that always
exceeds them. Since the image is itself a kind of sign, a first
representation, the advent of the imaginary demarcates the first
thetic break, a break from nature and into the realm of convention.
What Kristeva means by the thetic then includes both the imaginary
(the mirror stage) and the symbolic (the Oedipal Complex) dimensions
of Lacan, thereby altering his understanding of the imaginary domain.
Only with the advent of the thetic phase, the &ldquo;threshold of
language&rdquo; (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 45]), can there be said to be
signification proper along with negation as judgment.</p>

<p>
Kristeva attends to the pre-Oedipal mother/child relation in a way
that is underdeveloped in Freud&rsquo;s and Lacan&rsquo;s works.
Nonetheless, Kristeva accepts Freud&rsquo;s insight that the thetic
break or the prohibitory break of the Oedipal Complex that founds law
and sociality is violent and murderous (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 70]).
However, as she puts it, &ldquo;the structural violence of
language&rsquo;s irruption as the murder of soma, the transformation
of the body, the captation of drives&rdquo; (Kristeva 1974 [1984:
75]), is preceded by a loving father who makes possible the
preliminary individuation of the infant from the mother.</p>

<p>
Although symbolic violence is integral to the maintenance of a social
order, the promise of language on Kristeva&rsquo;s account is
initially brought forward by love, not by law. In <em>Tales of
Love</em> (1983 [1987]),which jumps off from Freud&rsquo;s claim in
<em>The Ego and the Id</em> that identification with the father of
individual pre-history is prior to and more primary than
object-cathexis, Kristeva offers an original account of the
pre-Oedipal period, finding a paternal figure there. The imaginary
father makes possible the initial separation between ego and object,
or rather proto-ego and proto-object. This father is not the first
object, but the first identification, making language and love
possible, movement within and among a world of others.</p>

<p>
This identification, Kristeva hypothesizes, alters maternal space, and
interrupts it with something beyond its borders. But it also indicates
that there is a preliminary pre-thetic symbolic capacity at work in
infantile life. As the drives expel, detach, or isolate a
proto-object, the space of differentiation is supported by
identification with the imaginary father, who holds it open. The
imaginary father is here associated with love (unlike the symbolic
father who is associated with law), an invitation to language and
subjectivity, to become a being who can have relations with
others.</p>

<p>
The breaking in of the signifier inaugurates individuation, the
assumption of bodily form and corporeal unity, and thereby entails
loss of the maternal body. Unlike Irigaray, who wants to retrieve the
pre-Oedipal period in order to reclaim feminine genealogies, Kristeva
wants only to redescribe it in order to reassess its import for
individuation and creative self-transformation. She takes infantile
matricide (separation from the mother) to be a necessary condition of
subjectivity and not a remnant of patriarchal violence.</p>

<p>
Signification and language are sites of sublimation, creative
workings-out of the drives, but they can be stalled by abjection and
melancholia which are both preconditions for, but also limits to,
subjectification. Kristeva identifies abjection and melancholia as
sites of psychical (and social) crisis rooted in narcissistic
disorder. In them, the tenuous processes of ego-formation risk
collapse; faced with difficulty clarifying the boundaries of the self,
the subject reverts to ambivalent aggressivity. While Kristeva
understands narcissism to be a fundamental, if unstable, structure of
the psyche, abjection and melancholia are problematic relations to the
maternal body and its loss (or the malfunctioning of its loss). They
are experiences of disintegration or dissolution of the ego without
reorganization, but also of its rabid fortification.</p>

<p>
In <em>Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection</em> (1980 [1982]), the
abject is described as neither inside nor outside, neither subject nor
object, neither self nor other, troubling identity and order with the
instability of boundaries, borders, and limits. Kristeva offers
examples of bodily fluids, sweat, blood, pus, and milk as non-objects
that are banished in the course of ego formation. These non-objects
also include the mother&rsquo;s body; indeed the maternal body is a
privileged site of abjection, as it is that which must be excluded in
order for individuation and separation to take place so that one can
distinguish self from other and establish a dyadic (imaginary)
relation out of undifferentiated maternal space or the semiotic chora,
the pre-spatial relation of fluid (although not entirely unregulated)
drives. The chora refers to the first six months or earliest,
pre-linguistic period of an infant&rsquo;s existence when the
child&rsquo;s perceptions are determined by her or his drives, a
mixture of feelings and needs, and when the child cannot distinguish
between her-/himself and the mother as separate entities. The abject
can then also be called the primally repressed, primal because prior
not only to the secondary symbolic prohibition of the incest taboo or
Oedipal Complex but also prior to the establishment of any
identity.</p>

<p>
The abject is horrifying, repellent, but also fascinating; it is
strange but familiar. The process of abjection is not merely a symptom
of phobia or borderline disorder, but a necessary and even recurring
ordeal in any subject&rsquo;s transition to identification with the
father and accession to language. It is the most archaic form of
negativity, an exclusion or expulsion which functions by securing the
borders of self, carving a space, and marking a divide, out of which
the ego can emerge. Kristeva calls it the violent attempt &ldquo;to
release the hold of maternal entity&rdquo; (Kristeva 1980 [1982: 13])
or rather what will have been the mother since this process
establishes the distinction between the maternal body and the infant
in the first place. The abject exposes the precariousness of the
subject/object divide, the fragility of identity, and the need to
constitute oneself against the threat of, and desire for,
dissolution.</p>

<p>
Although this is not primarily Kristeva&rsquo;s concern, abjection can
also be understood as a social phenomenon, one with political
implications, which the US American feminist political philosopher
Iris Marion Young, in her <em>Justice and the Politics of
Difference</em> (1990) outlines. Young draws on Kristeva&rsquo;s
notion of the abject to explain how the primal repression of the
mother in which the infant struggles to break away and separate from
the mother&rsquo;s body to acquire a sense of self generates a fragile
border between the I (the self) and the other, with the self being in
constant danger to fall back into the unity. Although the self feels
the loss of the mother, it rejects re-enclosure, which could lead to
the disintegration of the self. Young points out that racism, sexism,
homophobia, ageism, and ableism are partly structured by abjection and
imply involuntary, unconscious judgments of ugliness and loathing of
the abjected other.</p>

<p>
The abject provokes fear because it exposes the fragile border between
the self and the Other. For example, since borders between gay and
straight are permeable, and everybody can become gay, especially me, I
need to defend my fragile heterosexual identity by turning away from
gays with irrational disgust. Another example Young provides is older
adults, who bring up the fear of death in me, the dissolving of
borders, which is why I unconsciously judge them as ugly and turn away
from them. Disabled people confront me with the fact that it is only
my good luck that I am not disabled myself, which is why I loathe
disabled people. Therefore, unconscious reactions on a bodily level,
which we often do not recognize because society privileges rationality
over the body, reinforce the oppression of vulnerable groups (Young
1990: 144).</p>

<p>
The confusion of borders, the ambivalent relation to maternal space,
also motivates melancholia. The idea of the maternal as the primally
repressed recurs in <em>Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia</em>,
where Kristeva claims, &ldquo;matricide is our vital necessity&rdquo;
(Kristeva 1987 [1989: 27]), the founding partition that facilitates
the birth and growth of the ego. Kristeva praises the child, the
&ldquo;intrepid wanderer&rdquo; who &ldquo;leaves the crib to meet the
mother in the realm of representations&rdquo; (1987 [1989: 41]).
Maintaining that the organization of the psyche is premised on loss,
Kristeva also understands that the suffering entailed by loss can
derail the formation of a self, and that loss itself can become the
dominant reality for some who are unable to establish a secure
relation to themselves.</p>

<p>
While mourning, for Kristeva as for Freud, enables a subject to,
gradually and painfully, let go of loss by establishing a relation in
language to it, melancholia enables the subject to hold onto lost
objects, most especially the mother or, better, the dead (or
repressed) mother. The loving father facilitates mourning and
linguistic creativity; the deadening mother disables self-creation. In
Kristeva&rsquo;s understanding of melancholic breakdown, the problem
is similar to the one discussed above in the section on Irigaray,
namely that loss goes unnamed and unmourned but thereby stays
unprocessed within, leaving the subject stagnant and inert.</p>

<p>
Women, in Kristeva&rsquo;s view, suffer the loss of creativity, the
incapacity for sublimation, more severely than men. Women&rsquo;s
access to language and creative self-transformation is more vulnerable
to disturbance both because of the (previously discussed) inexorable
repression of their pre-Oedipal relation to the mother and because
they have greater difficulty establishing a primary identification
with the father. Whereas the loss of the archaic bond with the
maternal body is (potentially) sublated by men into the rhythms of
language, for women it often becomes a dead space where once there was
life, filled only with loss and emptiness. Imprisoned by an undead,
unmourned, mother, excluded from language or representation, women are
vulnerable to the devastations of symbolic sacrifice without
recompense.</p>

<p>
Psychoanalysis is presented as a counter-depressant, as are art and
writing, able not only to keep the drives or semiotic forces moving
through language but also to foster their revolutionary potential to
transgress symbolic limits and laws and to creatively rework self and
society. Accessing the drives and rhythms that symbolic law and order
typically repress, psychoanalytic practice, like the poetic text,
revitalizes or reactivates the semiotic chora, a connection to the
maternal body or to femininity. Such practices let loose the
disorganizing energies of the body, the pleasurable rupture of sense
and nonsense. They take productive advantage of the dialectical
discord between semiotic and symbolic and thus keep this discord
oriented toward dissent and protest rather than inner collapse.</p>

<p>
Although the semiotic resists the symbolic order or cannot be
contained by it, the two are always entangled and imbricated in
language; drives both support and subvert the symbolic operation,
bringing bodily rhythms and forces to signification, both impelling
and pulling apart its organization and stasis. This disruptive
potential of semiotic drives and rhythms is associated with negativity
as a force of revolt, an excess, most archaically, the force of bodily
expulsion, but more generally the forces that continually spur the
dissolution of one&rsquo;s own organization. Negativity maintains
life, and keeps it going by circulating energy, rendering the subject
always in process. Through its movement, the subject is not a rigid
identity but always developing, reconfiguring itself through the
interplay of drives and language, in the tensions between body and
mirror image and between mirror image and self.</p>

<h2 id="AnglAmerPsycFemi">5. Anglo-American Psychoanalytic Feminism</h2>

<p>
There are a number of Anglo-American (and Australian) feminist
theorists and scholars who read Lacan and laid the groundwork for the
passage from French to English and from France to the US, Britain, and
Australia in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Among these are Juliet
Mitchell (<em>Psychoanalysis and Feminism</em>, 1974), Teresa Brennan
(<em>The Interpretation of the Flesh: Freud and Femininity</em>,
1992), Elizabeth Grosz (<em>Jacques Lacan: A Feminist
Introduction</em>, 1990), Jane Gallop (<em>Reading Lacan</em>, 1985,
and <em>The Daughter&rsquo;s Seduction</em>, 1982), Jacqueline Rose
(<em>Sexuality in the Field of Vision</em>, 1986), Drucilla Cornell
(<em>Transformations: Recollective Imagination and Sexual
Difference</em>, 1993). While writing in English, these theorists take
their bearings from the French Lacanian approach to psychoanalysis and
can generally be classified in the field of what today gets called
&ldquo;Continental Feminism.&rdquo; Responsible for revitalizing
psychoanalysis for feminist thought and countering earlier feminist
dismissals, they aim to reclaim Freud&rsquo;s central analyses for
feminist purposes. Juliet Mitchell, for instance, develops the insight
indispensable to any feminist reading, that &ldquo;psychoanalysis is
not a recommendation for a patriarchal society, but an analysis of
one&rdquo; (Mitchell 1974: xiii). Mitchell and Rose are also the
co-editors of <em>Feminine Sexuality</em> (1982), a selection from
Lacan&rsquo;s seminars, for which both editors wrote influential
introductions.</p>

<p>
Other psychoanalytic feminists have made use of Lacan&rsquo;s
association of the phallus with the real to explain that we can never
fully determine the meaning of sexual difference, which challenges any
attempts to essentialize masculinity and femininity. For example,
Suzanne Barnard explains that the Lacanian phallus &ldquo;does not
signify essential sexual difference but&hellip;stands ultimately for
the impossibility of signifying sex. As such, it can be understood to
represent both a traumatic failure of meaning and the impossibility of
ever fundamentally anchoring or positivizing the symbolic order&rdquo;
(Barnard and Fink 2002: 10). Some feminist thinkers suggest that the
phallus&rsquo;s link with the real, which tells us that we can never
reach reality, generates anxieties in men from whom we demand to have
the phallus.</p>

<p>
Feminist Lacanians have also pointed at the importance of the Lacanian
real for rethinking sexual difference beyond gendered dichotomies and
beyond essentializing gender categories. For example, the US American
psychoanalytic feminist Drucilla Cornell sees an inherent potential in
the real for feminist thought because we can never fully determine
what it means to be a &ldquo;woman&rdquo; or a &ldquo;man,&rdquo; and
which opens up a space to rethink these categories. For Cornell, the
real is central for feminist theorizing because it indicates that the
truth of what we are as subjects is never fully captured by gender
categories and it directs us to a potential that we can find &ldquo;in
this excess of what we can be thought to be within any gender
system&rdquo; (Cornell 1996: 159).</p>

<p>
Feminist thinkers also draw on Lacan&rsquo;s work to rethink the two
tensions inherent in the idea of the &ldquo;female political
subject&rdquo; and to further theorize power. The first is the tension
between the idea of a free and autonomous subject (defended by
mainstream liberal theories) and the idea of the subject as emerging
in the moment of subjection to power-discourses (defended by
Foucaultian-inspired feminist theorizing). Here, the question for
feminist theory remains: can we theorize the female subject as
emerging in the moment of subjection to power discourses and envision
her as a female political subject who can contest and transform power
structures? The second tension is between the thoughts that, on the
one hand, that the female political subject conceptualized as a
collectivity, a &ldquo;we&rdquo;, is inherently exclusionary, and on
the other hand, defining a political subject and invoking the concept
of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; remains necessary to theorize an agent of
sociopolitical transformation. Here, the question that remains is: can
we theorize the feminist political subject, a &ldquo;we&rdquo;
necessary for an agency, without such &ldquo;we&rdquo; becoming
exclusionary?</p>

<p>
The Austrian American psychoanalytic feminist thinker Claudia Leeb, in
her <em>Power and Feminist Agency in Capitalism</em> (2017), draws on
Lacan&rsquo;s concept of the real (and Theodor W. Adorno&rsquo;s
concept of non-identity) to engage with these tensions and find
answers to these questions. In response to the first tension, she
shows us that although the signifier (S, woman) brings the signified
(s, the female subject) into being, the signifier fails to entirely
subordinate her because there is a bar (/) between the signifier and
the signified (the Lacanian real), that resists absolute signification
(S/s). In this moment of the real, which she calls the moment limit,
the hole in the w/hole, the space opens up for women to step forward
as political subjects who are in a position to challenge and transform
oppressive power structures. In response to the second tension, she
draws on Lacan to formulate her idea of the female political
subject-in-outline. Such a female subject moves within the tension of
a certain coherence (the subject) to effect change and permanent
openness (the outline) to counter the exclusionary character of a
female collectivity. Because the feminist political subject-in-outline
embraces its non-wholeness, excluded subjects can enter (or exit) the
political collectivity and redefine its boundaries.</p>

<p>
The Anglo-American development of feminist psychoanalysis has also
descended from and is indebted to British object relations theory and
its focus on the pre-Oedipal mother-child bond, especially the work of
Melanie Klein (1975a, 1975b) and Donald Winnicott (1971). Authors who
work in this vein include Nancy Chodorow (<em>The Reproduction of
Mothering</em>, 1978), Dorothy Dinnerstein (<em>The Mermaid and the
Minotaur</em>, 1976), and Jessica Benjamin (<em>Bonds of Love</em>,
1988, and <em>Like Subjects, Love Objects</em>, 1995). What
distinguishes this Anglo-American tradition from the French-influenced
one is its emphasis on pre-Oedipal sociality or intersubjectivity and
its focus on the values of integration, harmony, and wholeness, as
opposed to those of self-division and respecting the alien within.</p>

<p>
The remainder of this section will focus on the work of Benjamin as
exemplary of the Anglo-American approach, and clarify its differences
from and similarities with the French approach. Like Irigaray,
Benjamin is perturbed by the psychoanalytic depiction of social life
as the world of men, developed on the basis of the father-son relation
and its aggression, hostility, love, and mourning. Deploring this
&ldquo;struggle for power&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988: 6) in which women are
merely the triangulating object of desire, Benjamin argues that, in
the formation of identity, subjects become bound by love to oppressive
social relations. She worries that &ldquo;domination is anchored in
the hearts of the dominated&rdquo; (1988: 5), that women are
erotically attached to patriarchal power, and she believes that
psychoanalysis can help explain how and why this is so. Psychoanalysis
thus offers to Benjamin insights not only into the individual psyche
but also into the organization, structure, and distribution of
political power and hierarchy. Her aim is &ldquo;to grasp the deep
structure of gender as a binary opposition which is common to psychic
and cultural representations&rdquo; (1988: 218).</p>

<p>
Unlike Kristeva and Irigaray, both of whom problematize the duality
and comprehensiveness of the nature/culture distinction, and emphasize
transformation of symbolic bonds, Benjamin highlights the role of
(contradictory) cultural stereotypes in bringing forth gender as we
know and live it, and emphasizes the need for social
transformation.Taking what she calls an eclectic approach, and
eschewing methodological orthodoxy with regard to Freudian
metapsychology and the theory of the instincts, Benjamin establishes
her project on the basis of a two-person relational perspective, with
the other as a separate independent subject. Rather than an
undifferentiated unity governing early infantile life in the
pre-Oedipal period, which would make of the infant merely a
&ldquo;monadic energy system&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988: 17), she maintains
that a genuine duality and relationality exist from the start and that
the process of growth entails development within relationships rather
than a development of them. The infant, she postulates, is a
fundamentally active and social creature, reaching out to the world
and expressing a desire for recognition. The knots of identity are
formed via the interplay of this desire with the response of another
who variously affirms or defies the child. Benjamin claims that this
emphasis on sociality and intersubjectivity is not intended to
disregard the intrapsychic elements of subject formation, and in fact
she argues for &ldquo;the interaction between the psyche and social
life&rdquo; (1988: 5). She holds that the inner and the outer are not
competitive but complementary theoretical perspectives. Nonetheless,
she does want to situate identity generally, and gendered identity
more specifically, within the purview of the subject&rsquo;s multiple
and ambiguous social identifications.</p>

<p>
Domination, she argues, ensues from the failures of recognition built
into the political and social order, not merely failures that take
place at the personal or individual level in a single relationship.
Borrowing an initial insight from Foucault, Benjamin looks at the way
power shapes and forms identities and desires, producing gendered
relations (Benjamin 1988: 4). Borrowing another insight from Hegel,
Benjamin depicts the dialectic of recognition in the struggle for
identity as a &ldquo;conflict between independence and
dependence&rdquo; (1988: 33). In her view, however, the Hegelian tale,
like the Freudian one, erroneously begins with a &ldquo;monadic,
self-interested ego&rdquo; (1988: 33) and it thus concludes with the
inevitability of breakdown and domination. According to Benjamin,
Winnicott resolves the Hegelian and Freudian dilemma (Benjamin 1988:
38), the solitary egoism of the fight to the death, by reformulating
the problem of recognition at the level of fantasy and distinguishing
between internal and external worlds. The infant feels confident in
asserting its independence, and destroying its object in fantasy, so
long as that object is discovered to have a secure external existence
in reality. In other words, the fantasy of destruction is appeased by
its failure; the infant destroys internally but externally is relieved
to still have an object to address and interact with. More
particularly, the infant destroys or separates from the mother
internally and in fantasy, but simultaneously retains a relation to
her externally and in reality. The good enough mother must foster this
relationship between two separate egos, neither allowing the child to
succeed in destroying or dominating her, nor allowing herself to
squash the child&rsquo;s nascent attempts at self-assertion. The
mother-child relation is then a kind of revised neo-Hegelian struggle
for power, retaining the aim of mutual recognition or respect, but
risking domination and rebellion. The violent conflicts within are not
repressed but neutralized and pacified in the reality of
intersubjective life that affirms and recognizes autonomy.</p>

<p>
Asking, as do Chodorow and Dinnerstein, about the genesis of
patriarchal power, Benjamin concludes, as they also do, that a main
source or component lies in exclusive childrearing by women/mothers,
which occasions the related risks of collapsing maternal authority
into mere dominance, supporting the fantasy of maternal omnipotence,
centering potent ambivalence on the mother, and fostering rigid gender
identities and identifications. While the boy attains autonomy via
loving identification with the father and separation from the mother,
the girl&rsquo;s relation to paternal power is complicated by its
inaccessibility to her. If she seeks &ldquo;liberation in the
father&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988: 99), she connects her femininity to
submission rather than agency, and attaches to masculinity as an
idealized object of love (and as its love-object), conferring on it
value while devaluing the mother, and creating a divide between
feminine sexuality and autonomous subjectivity. Benjamin argues,
however, that the &ldquo;protean impersonality&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988:
216) of male domination cannot be addressed by a critique that focuses
solely on the family and childcare, and that power relations cannot be
overcome solely through a transformation in caretaking roles, although
the equation of women with motherhood is certainly one component of
the problem. If gendered identities are encouraged by social power
relations&mdash;masculinity is developed as a denial of dependency and
assertion of independence, while femininity is developed in an
identification with nurturing and concession of autonomy&mdash;then
real transformation requires attention to social roles and
&ldquo;cultural representations&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988: 217), since
&ldquo;the core feature of the gender system&mdash;promoting
masculinity as separation from and femininity as continuity with the
primary bond&mdash;is maintained even when mother and father
participate equally in that bond&rdquo; (Benjamin 1988: 217). In
Benjamin&rsquo;s theoretical model, children are responsive not only
to their social environment, but also to ideas with opaque meanings
(mandates, expectations, prohibitions, exhortations, etc.) that are
often covertly, indirectly, or unknowingly conveyed in parental
language and edicts. Gender equality thus requires that women be
recognized, by themselves and by men, as subjects in culture and that
intersubjectivity itself be revalued.</p>

<p>
Benjamin&rsquo;s analysis can be distinguished from those of Irigaray
and Kristeva precisely by the way in which it tends to conflate or
collapse the distinction between representation and social roles.
While Anglo-American psychoanalytic feminism theorizes gender as
derived from or dependent on social (including familial) inequalities
and power relations, and thus aims to reduce its psychic effects by
redressing social and familial domination/subordination, French
feminism does not calibrate the psyche on socio-cultural relations but
on imaginary and symbolic representations. Benjamin&rsquo;s
partitioning of intrapsychic life into internal and external
relations, and her vision of intersubjective equilibrium is, in
contrast to Irigaray and Kristeva&rsquo;s assertion of discord within
and between subjects, oriented by the conviction that social harmony
is desirable and attainable.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Psychoanalysis presents a critical and diagnostic project, not
necessarily a normative or liberatory one. In developing a theory of
the drives and the non-rational forces that move and impel us, the
idea that we are opaque rather than transparent to ourselves,
incapable of complete self-knowledge or self-mastery, psychoanalytic
theory also challenges the rationalist, humanist ego and proposes that
our ethical characters and political communities are not perfectable,
exposing the precariousness of both psychic and political identity.
The unconscious cannot be assumed to be inherently either a
transgressive or a conservative force, but an unreliable one,
promoting revolt or rebellion sometimes, intransigence and rigid
border preservation at other times.</p>

<p>
Although they are in often uneasy alliance, the psychoanalytic account
of the unconscious provides feminist theory with resources for both
political and ontological inquiry. Ontologically, psychoanalysis
offers a distinctively psychical understanding of sexual difference,
how we come to inhabit our bodies and our identities, and misinhabit
them, an analysis reducible to neither social nor biological
categories. Politically, psychoanalysis offers a depiction of the
forces that impel us to organize, disorganize, and reorganize the
bonds that hold us together. By offering insight into the formation of
subjectivity and the animating fantasies of social life,
psychoanalysis thus also facilitates feminist analysis of the obdurate
elements of patriarchal social relations, including the symbolic bonds
and internal forces that undergird identity and attach sexed subjects
to relations of dominance and subordination. Psychoanalytic feminist
attention to the core constituents of civilization, to the nuclei of
sexual difference and communal affiliation, helps explain the
perpetuation of masculine power and enables feminist theorists to
articulate possible correctives, challenges, routes of amelioration,
or ethical interruptions that go to the roots of political life and to
its beyond and do not simply operate on the given social terrain.</p>
