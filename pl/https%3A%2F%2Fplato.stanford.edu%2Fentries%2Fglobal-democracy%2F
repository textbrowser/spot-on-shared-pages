<h1>Global Democracy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Feb 23, 2015; substantive revision Fri Dec 5, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Global democracy is a field of academic study and political activism
concerned with making the global political system more democratic.
This topic has become a central area of inquiry for established
literatures including political philosophy, international relations
(IR), international law, and sociology. Along with global justice
(and, in some ways, scholarship in the just war tradition), global
democracy has also been critical to the emergence of international
political theory as a discrete literature in recent decades. Whereas
global justice scholars tend to focus on how burdens and benefits
should be distributed by international institutions, global democrats
probe how political power can be legitimated beyond the nation-state.
Global democracy is therefore concerned with how transnational
decision-making can be justified and who should be entitled to
participate in the formation of global rules, laws, and
regulations.</p>

<p>
This entry contains five sections which elaborate upon the
possibility and problems for global democracy. The first discusses how
globalization impacts upon the nation-state and what this means for
traditional conceptions of democracy. The notion of a global
democratic deficit&mdash;in which individuals are removed from
transnational decision-making in problematic ways&mdash;is introduced,
and reasons to pursue global democracy are fleshed out. The second
section outlines some prominent normative proposals for global
democracy. Specifically, five &lsquo;models of global democracy&rsquo;
are presented, and some general criticisms are formulated. The third
section then highlights a turn toward pursuing &lsquo;values of
democratization&rsquo;. This direction for the literature has both
methodological and substantive implications. The fourth section
canvasses the emergent literature dedicated to assessing the
plausibility of global democracy as an empirical project. The final
section highlights persistent criticisms that should be addressed in
future research on global democracy.</p>

<h2 id="DemGloSys">1. Democracy and the Global System</h2>

<h3 id="DemGloNatSta">1.1 Democracy, Globalization, and the Nation-State</h3>

<p>
A review of global democracy must begin with how globalization has
impacted the nation-state and the consequences for national democracy
(Bray and Slaughter 2014). Although volumes have been written about
the theory and practice of democracy, the concept remains difficult to
define. Etymologically the term is simple enough: democracy means rule
by the people (<em>demos</em> meaning &lsquo;people&rsquo; and
<em>kratos</em> meaning &lsquo;rule&rsquo; or &lsquo;power&rsquo;).
This basic definition can be extrapolated in different ways. At its
core, however, most scholars agree that democracy refers to a
political practice in which individuals govern themselves through some
form of equitable decision-making process. This leaves open two
fundamental issues: who constitutes &lsquo;the people&rsquo; and how
&lsquo;rule-making&rsquo; should occur.</p>

<p>
Historically, democracy first took hold in the ancient city states of
Mesopotamia and Greece through direct mechanisms such as sortition
(Keane 2009). Since the 18th Century, though, the ideal of democracy
has become wedded to rise of the nation-state. The modern state is a
distinctive form of political organization based on sovereign autonomy
over a delimited territory and population. Through a centrally
organized government, the state wields a monopoly over the legitimate
use of violence as well as the right to taxation (Giddens 1985). In
exchange for these coercive powers, the state generates its legitimacy
through democratic mechanisms: giving its citizenry equal say in how
national laws and public policy are formed.</p>

<p>
National democracy is typically institutionalized as a representative
system that involves competitive elections and a publicly determined
rule of law. Although there are many different national voting systems
(plurality, proportional representation, preferential, etc.), the
basic idea is that each enfranchised citizen of the state has one vote
at the ballot box and can thus freely choose their preferred
representative, leader, or party. Through the American and French
Revolutions, and the &lsquo;Third Wave of Democratization&rsquo;
(where representative democracy spread to Latin America, the
Asia-Pacific, and the Eastern bloc), the notion that the nation-state
is the natural container for democracy became dominant (Huntington
1991). Over time, then, &lsquo;the people&rsquo; in democracy has been
assumed to correspond neatly with the citizenry of each particular
nation-state.</p>

<p>
In recent years, however, the supposed alliance between democracy and
the nation-state has come unstuck. This is due predominantly to
globalization: the increased extent, velocity, and scope of
cross-border interactions, transactions, and relations (Scholte 2000).
Globalization intensifies social, political, and economic relations
through technological changes and the flow of people, resources and
ideas across state lines. The expansion of global connections has gone
hand-in-glove with increased efforts to govern global affairs.
Countless formal measures, informal norms and overarching discourses
for regulating global affairs are now formulated and implemented
through complex transnational networks that combine substate agencies,
nation-states, regional bodies, global institutions, and non-state
actors (Scholte 2014, 4). Although the state is often an active
participant in globalization, many scholars have argued that increased
transnational activity undermines national democracy (Sassen 2003).
Globalization pierces the sovereignty of nation-states by subjecting
domestic affairs to transnational decision-making. Moreover, citizens
of each state are often said to be problematically excluded from
global activities in ways that lead to a democratic deficit (expanded
upon below).</p>

<h3 id="GloDemDef">1.2 The Global Democratic Deficit</h3>

<p>
The array of transnational institutions that govern social, political,
and economic processes is bewildering. Formal institutions include
international organizations (IO), intergovernmental organizations
(IGO), non-governmental organizations (NGO), and private bodies
(Tallberg et al. 2013). Informal institutions include epistemic
communities, transnational networks, and the basic structure of
transnational norms that make the world &lsquo;hang together&rsquo;
(Ruggie 1998).</p>

<p>
As the number of these transnational institutions has increased with
globalization, so too has their capacity to exercise authority
(Z&uuml;rn et al. 2012). Many scholars have noted that this authority
often enables international institutions to wield pervasive forms of
<em>public power</em> that impact (and potentially constrain) the
lives of individuals (Macdonald 2008). This occurs through
international law-making, regulatory standard-setting, and the
promotion of new norms. As decisions are taken beyond the state,
national leaders are often unable to control the forces which impact
domestic institutions and citizens. Correspondingly, and as a result,
individuals within each state have neither a direct nor (in many
instance) indirect say in how global rules are forged as their
national representatives are removed from sites of public power. This
undermines the notion that individuals can collectively and equally
govern their joint affairs. This gap &ndash; between transnational
rule-makers and individual rule-takers&ndash; is referred to as the
global democratic deficit. Global democracy, broadly conceived, is a
project seeking to remedy these deficits by granting individuals a say
in transnational-rule making by identifying sites of transnational
rule-making, rethinking who constitutes the demos, and constructing
mechanism for democratic inclusion.</p>

<p>
Global democratic deficits are compounded by at least three additional
factors. The first is an issue of procedure: international bodies
often operate with unaccountable and non-transparent processes. This
makes it difficult to identify the steps in a causal chain which link
transnational rule-makers with rule-takers. The second factor is
scope: current arrangements of transnational institutions seem
incapable of tackling the most pressing issues of a globalizing world
&mdash;climate change, spread of infectious diseases, volatile
financial markets, enormous poverty rates, unjust supply chains, just
to name a few. This is compounded by the fact that nation-states are
often unable to deal with transnational issues since capital flight, a
lack of international tax regulations, and brain drain systematically
undermine domestic capacity. This results in a lack of domestic
decision-making capacity which correspondingly makes it difficult for
individuals to shape their world (either through their nation-state or
otherwise). Third is an issue of constituency: globalization is
reshaping who constitutes &lsquo;the people&rsquo; due democratic
standing in decision-making processes. As Andrew Linklater (1998)
notes, globalization generates postnational communities of fate not
based on national boundaries but upon shared problems and mutual
allegiances. Global sites of public power therefore may need to have,
or even warrant, forms of democratic legitimacy not tied to the
nation-state system.</p>

<p>
This final point bears emphasis because it has (re-)ignited debates in
democratic theory over the so-called &lsquo;boundary problem&rsquo;:
who is entitled to take part in democratic decision-making processes
(Agn&eacute; 2006)? This question is often thought to be paradoxical
because democratic theory offers no internal solution for delineating
&lsquo;the people&rsquo;: unless we already know who is eligible to
participate in democratic procedures, we do not know who to include in
the initial decision-making process. As globalization erodes the idea
that the citizenry represents a natural embodiment of &lsquo;the
people&rsquo;, we need to search for alternate ways to justify
democratic inclusion. This also makes global democratic deficits
distinct from national ones, as the latter presupposes a rough
&lsquo;demos&rsquo;, while the
former <span class="nw">(re-)opens</span> the normative question of
inclusion.</p>

<p>
Although a full survey is neither possible nor necessary here, two
prominent responses have been advocated in the literature for
reconfiguring the demos in light of globalization (Goodin 2007).
First, all individuals subjected to rules, laws, and regulations
should take part in writing those rules. Second, all individuals
significantly affected by a decision-making process should have an
equal say in how that power is exercised. While these two positions
provide a basis for delineating the people in a globalizing world,
there are clear differences between them. The former is relatively
narrow: only individuals to whom rules actually apply should be part
of the decision-making. By contrast, the latter is much broader:
global decisions often have wide-reaching and indirect consequences
beyond those subjected. To take a simple example: individuals in a
country not a member of the WTO are not subjected to WTO rules, but
they are affected by the general system of international tariffs that
the WTO regulates. Should these individuals be entitled to a
democratic right of participation in WTO decisions? From this, we can
see that whether we chose subjectedness or affectedness matters
because each criterion entails a significantly different domain of
democratic inclusion. As such, further research is required to shed
light on how, or even if, the boundary problem can be resolved, and
its implications for global democracy (for an effort in this vein, see
Koenig-Archibugi 2017).</p>

<h3 id="WhyGloDem">1.3 Why Global Democracy?</h3>

<p>
Global democrats thus share the view that individuals should
collectively rule themselves. To the extent that decision-making power
migrates beyond the state, democracy should follow. There is, of
course, a prior question about why individuals should have roughly
equal say in decision-making in the first place. On one level, it is a
simple definitional requirement of democracy. But this point simply
begs the question: why should we pursue democracy at all? As with
theoretical discussions of democracy, a variety of intrinsic and
instrumental reasons for global democracy can be discerned in the
literature. Intrinsic justifications point to democracy as a valuable
method of decision-making in-and-of-itself. Instrumental claims hinge
upon the outcome of democracy being beneficial, especially compared to
alternatives.</p>

<p>
The most common intrinsic claim relates to cosmopolitanism, which many
proponents of global democracy have drawn upon as a moral foundation
motivating the project (Kant 1991[1795]). Thomas Pogge (1992:
48&ndash;9) has argued that cosmopolitans share at least this set of
beliefs: 1) that human beings are the ultimate units of moral concern;
2) this status applies to all humans equally; 3) everyone should be
treated as ultimate units of concern by all others. Global democracy
helps realize this cosmopolitan ideal by treating all individuals as
moral beings capable of exercising equal control over shared
destinies. It is important to note, however, that differences between
global democrats exist in terms of the scope of their cosmopolitan
commitment. While almost all global democrats see individuals as the
fundamental object of concern, many proponents argue that relational
qualities still matter in generating normative prescriptions (Miller
1995). As such, &lsquo;national communities&rsquo; or
&lsquo;humanity&rsquo; may well be important groups that deserve
standing in global democratic politics for moral or pragmatic
reasons.</p>

<p>
Several other intrinsic arguments, though, have been made in
literature. These claims all suggest that global democracy is morally
desirable irrespective of the benefits generated. For instance, many
scholars have suggested that global democracy embodies equality,
autonomy, non-domination, and human rights (see respectively: Erman
2012; Held 1995; Bohman 2007; Goodhart 2008). These fundamental rights
should be valued for their own sake and therefore provide an
additional moral foundation&mdash;related to, but sometimes distinct
from, cosmopolitanism&mdash;for pursuing democracy beyond borders.
These arguments are most common amongst liberal democrats and
neo-Roman republicans (Pettit 1997).</p>

<p>
Other scholars put instrumental considerations at the fore. For
instance, proponents have maintained that global democracy is required
for epistemic, problem-solving, justice, and legitimacy-based reasons.
John Dryzek (2000) has noted that democracy enables a wide-variety of
perspectives to shape policy and thus increases the chances of making
the &lsquo;correct&rsquo; decision (see also Landemore 2013).
Similarly, scholars in the pragmatist tradition of John Dewey have
suggested that global democracy is required to generate compliance
with international rules and thus solve collective action problems
such as climate change (Bray 2013). By participating in the formation
of law-making, individuals are more likely to comply with the
agreement. Laura Valentini (2012) has claimed that global democracy is
required for global justice. Democratic mechanisms need to be in place
to sort out reasonable disagreements as to how resources should be
allocated. Finally, Michael Z&uuml;rn and his co-authors (2012)
suggest that global democratic procedures can help provide IOs with
important stocks of sociological legitimacy and hence avoid
complications of politicization (see also Buchanan and Keohane
2006).</p>

<h2 id="ModGloDem">2. Models of Global Democracy</h2>

<p>
There are many different proposals for global democracy and,
correspondingly, many different taxonomical divisions have been
developed. For instance, Scholte (2014) divides the literature into
&lsquo;statist&rsquo; and &lsquo;modern cosmopolitan&rsquo;
approaches. The former refers to efforts to secure individual
participation by strengthening multilateral institutions and shoring
up the link between citizens and their representative, while the
latter seeks to make international institutions open for individual
participation. Archibugi et al. (2012, 7) suggest a tripartite
(ideal-typical) break between federalist (world state), confederalist
(intergovernmental democratic states), and polycentric (pluralist)
prescriptions for global democracy. And Gr&aacute;inne de B&uacute;rca
(2007, 117) identifies three strands in the current literature to
which she affixes the nomenclature of a &lsquo;denial approach&rsquo;,
a &lsquo;wishful thinking approach&rsquo;, and a &lsquo;compensatory
approach&rsquo;. The denial approach suggests that there is no
&ldquo;democracy problem&rdquo; in transnational governance to be
fixed, the wishful-thinking approach presumes that transnational
governance can be easily democratized, the compensatory approach looks
for other, non-democratic sources of legitimacy for global
rule-making. This entry takes a different tack by presenting five
different &lsquo;models&rsquo; of global democracy. Models represent
idealized theoretical constructions designed to express the normative
qualities of a democratic system as well as its constitutive
institutions. Models tend to fit together as whole pieces and are thus
relatively discrete and well-developed proposals. The following
subsections outline five prominent models. Specific attention is paid
to the normative underpinnings, institutional design, and problems of
feasibility and desirability associated with each model.</p>

<h3 id="IntDemSta">2.1 Intergovernmental Democratic States</h3>

<p>
Proponents of this model contend that world politics is democratic to
the extent that each sovereign state is internally democratic with a
functioning government and rule of law. Citizens thus have democratic
representation beyond the state through their national government.
This tradition has been developed and continued by Immanuel Kant,
Robert Dahl, Ingeborg Maus, John Rawls, and many others. The crucial
normative ideal underpinning this model is liberal and cosmopolitan in
orientation: all individuals deserve an equal chance to participate in
the rule-making that governs their lives. This is necessary for
citizens to have liberty and self-determination. Unlike other
cosmopolitans, though, these theorists argue that the nation-state
plays a key normative and practical role in global democracy.</p>

<p>
Befitting a model that has a long history in democratic thought,
different institutional designs have been offered. In Perpetual Peace,
for instance, Kant (1991 [1795]) argued for a global federation of
peoples composed of republican (i.e. democratic) states. In this
federation, states would observe a cosmopolitan right to hospitality,
aid, and territory. John Rawls (1999) similarly advocated an
international &lsquo;law of peoples&rsquo; in which liberal democratic
states (and decent states) establish international laws that generate
a peaceful and tolerant international order. Some scholars in this
line, such as Robert Keohane, Andrew Moravcsik, and Stephen Macedo
(2009), have gone even further and suggested that IOs can help keep
peace between states (a core Kantian claim), and safeguard democracy,
deliberation, and human rights. Transnational activities are
democratically legitimate from the perspective of citizens so long as
each nation-state maintains autonomy and sovereignty in global
affairs. This allows supranational competences to be controlled and
even revoked by member-states and their leaders (Z&uuml;rn 2000).</p>

<p>
Although this model has been prominent in the global democracy field,
it has several problems. First, only around 50 per cent of
nation-states today are democratic. As such, much of the world&rsquo;s
population is without democratic representation at either the national
or transnational level. Second, nation-states do not have complete
control over international institutions. IR scholars increasingly note
that IOs, which are delegated authority from nation-states, suffer
from &lsquo;agency slack&rsquo;. This means that actors within IOs
(diplomats, bureaucrats, and so on) are able to carve out their own
space for action. This power cannot easily be controlled or recaptured
by member-states.</p>

<p>
Next, sophisticated recent work on international authority separates
between &lsquo;delegation&rsquo; &ndash; whereby authority can
potentially be maintained through a veto right &ndash; and pooling
&ndash; in which sovereignty can be overridden by different voting
procedures (super-majorities, generally) (Hooghe and Marks 2015).
Global democrats would do well to flesh out the theoretical
implications of this difference. While exit remains a theoretical
possibility for states from IOs under both pooling and delegation as a
way to recapture authority and shift it to the domestic level, this is
not always viable in the short- or long-term. Moreover, it is not
clear that a &lsquo;potential&rsquo; for exit would eradicate a
democratic deficit any more than a citizen&rsquo;s right to exit a
nation-state. Finally, transnational networks and private forms of
governance have proliferated beyond the state. These agents often have
the capacity to create global regulations which impact on domestic
citizens. Nation-states typically have no direct say in these bodies.
As such, the intergovernmental model provides many interesting
insights, but has failed to keep pace with empirical developments.</p>

<h3 id="CosDem">2.2 Cosmopolitan Democracy</h3>

<p>
Cosmopolitan democracy is perhaps the most well-known model of global
democracy. The core idea is to lift statist institutions to the global
level in an on-going effort for democratization. David Held, Daniele
Archibugi, and Simon Caney have all been prominent advocates.
Normatively, the model rests on a foundation of autonomy: creating
global political conditions that allow individuals to shape and direct
their own lives. This requires, at the least, a system which protects
human rights and provides democratic mechanisms for citizen input
(Goodhart 2005). This model is also explicitly cosmopolitan as it is
supposed to apply to all individuals across the globe.</p>

<p>
Institutionally, cosmopolitan democracy stops short of a fully-fledged
world government. As David Held (2003, 478) notes, &ldquo;a
cosmopolitan polity does not call for a diminution per se of state
power and capacity across the globe. Rather it seeks to entrench and
develop political institutions at regional and global level as
necessary complements to those at the level of the state.&rdquo; This
occurs by replicating national democratic institutions at the
transnational and global levels, such as the creation of a global
parliamentary assembly, international courts, and a constitutional
rule of law (Falk and Strauss 2001; Goodin 2010). These institutions
provide a framework to shield human rights and exercise individual
autonomy by voting in global elections. Moreover, these institutions
are charged with effectively regulating transnational problems that
national institutions cannot tackle alone: climate change, the
diffusion of nuclear weapons, and financial markets. This particular
model has given rise to a long-running campaign for the creation of a
United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (see Other Internet Resources
section).</p>

<p>
This model is also not without complication. First, the proposals are
often thought to be infeasible. By this, critics usually mean that
there is a lack of political will to establish organizations such as a
global parliament which would remove some sovereign powers from
nation-states. Although Held (1995) and Archibugi (2008) often claim
that cosmopolitan democracy should be separated into short-term
targets and longer-term ideals, it is not always clear which agents
would pursue the model nor how current institutional arrangements
could be overcome (though see Archibugi and Held (2011) for some
suggestions). Would the IMF, the World Bank, or the International
Accounting Standards Board, for example, readily give up their control
over global financial governance? And even if they did, the billions
of individuals living in non-democratic states would remain excluded
from shaping collective rules. Second, some critics also charge the
cosmopolitan model with being undesirable. Although the project is
designed to reduce the global democratic deficit, it does so by
reproducing liberal democratic institutions beyond the state.
Postcolonial arguments have been made against this reliance on liberal
institutions which represent a specific form of (Western) democracy
that emerged from Europe and the United State (Scholte 2014).</p>

<h3 id="WorGov">2.3 World Government</h3>

<p>
A world government has also been seen as a potential response to the
global democratic deficit. Scholarship on world government has a long
history in academia and social commentary: Hugo Grotius, Jeremy
Bentham and Abb&eacute; de Saint-Pierre in the former camp; Albert
Einstein, HG Wells, and Martin Luther King in the latter. Recently,
the concept has seen a revival in the work of Luis Cabrera (2004),
Andrew Kuper (2004), and J&uuml;rgen Habermas (2006). World government
proposals are justified in terms of both intrinsic and instrumental
concerns. On the intrinsic side, world government advocates take a
cosmopolitan stance and demand equal respect for all individuals. As
such, individuals should have equal say in how transnational rules are
formed to reduce the global democratic deficit. This intrinsic claim
is often coupled with justice-based arguments concerning a fairer
distribution of resources (Marchetti 2008). On the instrumental side,
those such as T&auml;nnsj&ouml; (2008) contend that a world government
is necessary to overcome global problems such as war and ecological
disaster.</p>

<p>
World government proponents seek a centralized global system, with
some federal powers devolved to lower levels (insufficient work in
this space has focused on how to determine boundaries of
subsidiarity). As Cabrera (2004, 71) notes, a world government would
require a &ldquo;restructuring of the global system to bring states
under the authority of just supranational institutions.&rdquo; A
central government would sit at the core with autonomous and coercive
decision-making potential. As with cosmopolitan democracy, a world
government would also entail a directly-elected global parliament,
empowered courts, and a singular global constitution which explicates
basic rights and duties for all. In many cases, proponents stipulate
that a world government could come about through a major recalibration
of the United Nations General Assembly. Famously, Habermas has also
argued for a three-tiered hierarchical global system in which
supranational, transnational, and national institutions are
implemented to secure rights, peace, and global democracy. Although
Habermas might deny advocating a world government, William Scheuerman
(2008, 148) argues that Habermas&rsquo;s attempt to pursue stronger
supranational governance combined with a global constitution would
have that result.</p>

<p>
Despite Alexander Wendt&rsquo;s (2003) teleological claim that a world
government is &lsquo;inevitable&rsquo;, many people deride the concept
as infeasible. Without another major crisis (such as a world war) to
prompt international action, it is difficult to envisage why states
would readily give sovereign power to a global state and who precisely
would take the lead in this process. Although UN reform is often cited
as one pathway forward, the veto position held in the Security Council
by the United States, China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom
undermines that option. From the perspective of desirability,
moreover, opponents have argued that a world government would actually
exacerbate the global democratic deficit. For example, Kant argued
that a world government would become a &lsquo;soulless
despotism&rsquo; as global leaders abused their power without
appropriate checks and balances. Other scholars have also suggested a
world government&mdash;in which citizens have one vote from a
constituency of seven billion&mdash;would be essentially meaningless
and not enable individuals to participate meaningfully in their
collective governance.</p>

<h3 id="DelDem">2.4 Deliberative Democracy</h3>

<p>
Global democracy scholarship has also been infused by myriad
deliberative democratic proposals. This model suggests that global
politics can be democratized by pursuing deliberation&mdash;the give
and take of non-coercive and reasoned arguments&mdash;in various
formal and informal sites. A vast number of authors have promoted this
model, including John Dryzek, Seyla Benhabib, and James Bohman. The
fundamental normative ideal is that non-coercive, reciprocal, and
generalizable deliberation should guide action, and that
decision-making be justified to those affected (Forst 2011).
Individuals should be free to put their ideas forward under
egalitarian conditions, take on-board the ideas of others, and
recalibrate preferences in line with &lsquo;better arguments&rsquo;.
This helps to respect the autonomy of different agents while also
enhancing the epistemic quality of decision-making. This model has
clear connections with a &lsquo;stakeholder model&rsquo; of global
democracy, in which those individuals significantly affected by a
global decision should be able to deliberate over how public power is
exercised and how power wielders are held to account (Macdonald
2008).</p>

<p>
This model seeks the deliberative democratization of informal and
formal sites of existing governance arrangements from the local to the
global level. As such, the institutional design task is usually about
recalibrating current institutions and organizations to reflect
non-coercive argumentation rather than creating new bodies. At the
informal level, some deliberative democrats point to transnational
public spheres as appropriate sites for democratic agency (Steffek
2010). Indeed, some claim that a global civil society has emerged
which provides a space&mdash;separate from the state and the
market&mdash;for individuals to deliberate, shape preferences, and
create shared goals (Dryzek 2000). The model also calls for the
deliberation democratization of formal sites, such as WTO
negotiations, IMF loan deals, and regional treaty agreements
(B&auml;ckstrand 2006). By making negotiations more
deliberative&mdash;responsive to the reasoned arguments of affected
individuals&mdash;world politics becomes more democratic. At the
intersection of formal and informal proposals, deliberative democrats
often point to the increasing inclusion of non-state actors in formal
organizations as a step toward global democracy (Dryzek 2012). As
NGOs, youth groups, epistemic communities, and business organizations
gain access to sites of international decision-making, this helps
increase the diversity of viewpoints and provides non-state groups
with a way to contest traditional IGO negotiations (Tallberg et al.
2013). Many actors in global civil society have accused IOs of
suffering from a democratic deficit as a strategy to gain inclusion.
This highlights the interconnections between academia and policy
practice in terms of global democracy.</p>

<p>
Global deliberative democracy has had many proponents and even more
critics. A fairly standard complaint is that the model fails to
provide a specific institutional design which can be sought or
realized under existing conditions. Moreover, deliberation is said to
suffer from a lack of decisiveness. Voting mechanisms always allow for
individuals to cast their preferences with the understanding that 50
per cent plus one vote wins the election. Deliberation provides no
mechanism for groups to make definitive decisions, and talking until
agreement (consensus) is reached is both time-consuming and
potentially unrealizable. In terms of desirability, Eva Erman (2012)
has argued that deliberative democrats do not take the notion of
equality seriously enough, thus undermining a core ideal of democracy.
It is difficult to envisage, Erman suggests, how individuals can have
equal opportunity for deliberation in a world of inequality.
Relatedly, the inclusion of non-state actors in formal IOs is often
seen as a form of cooptation in which civil society actually works in
subservience to (and thus legitimates) the established system. This
line of criticism could be classified as a
&lsquo;governmentality&rsquo; critique in the tradition of Foucault.
As such, there is a concern that including civil society in
deliberation with formal sites of global decision-making
exacerbates&mdash;rather than reduces&mdash;the global democratic
deficit.</p>

<h3 id="RadDem">2.5 Radical Democracy</h3>

<p>
This model is grounded in an ethics of revolution, in which
autonomous, self-governing communities can resist and overthrow the
global system of sovereignty and its hierarchical capitalist relations
(Bray and Slaughter forthcoming, 158). Variants on this position have
been promoted by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Chantal Mouffe, and
Jan Aart Scholte. The fundamental normative claim is that collectives
can only be emancipated through the rejection of capitalism, property
rights, and class-based notions of governance. In other words, these
structures create systems of domination and alienation that need to be
overcome. According to Hardt and Negri (2000), communities and social
movements should challenge the current liberal order of politics and
seek new forms of global governance based on cooperation, affection,
and nature. This model has close connections with direct forms of
democracy.</p>

<p>
The institutional design of radical democracy is, almost by
definition, underspecified. Proponents argue against the existing
global system in which sovereignty has been eclipsed by empire: the
subservience of politics to capitalism. It is therefore up to
collectives to overhaul current arrangements and establish new forms
of governance, the design of which can only emerge through the process
of reconstruction itself. Both Chantal Mouffe (2009) and Jan Aart
Scholte (2014) are clear that radical democracy entails the rejection
of Western, liberal democratic institutions (such as parliaments and
constitutions) and their reliance on individualism and capitalism.
Rather, Scholte (2014) argues that we should open up our conception of
how global democracy should look to take due consideration of
transscalarity, plural solidarities, transculturality, egalitarian
distribution, and ecology that constitute social and material
life.</p>

<p>
In terms of feasibility, it is difficult to know how radical global
democracy might come about. Although we can point at potential
examples&mdash;such as the Occupy Wall Street movement or the
Zapatista Army&mdash;concrete institutional moments are difficult to
come by. Moreover, radical democrats are often quick to note that
globalization has been coopted by capitalism, and that it reinforces
colonial legacies in developing countries. It is hard to comprehend
how collectives of free and equal individuals can form in a
transnational context where much of the global South is removed from
the technological and communicative benefits of globalization.
Paradoxically, then, the groups most in need of democratic revolution
are precisely those groups with less access to means of transnational
activism (the Internet, attending global protests, signing petitions,
etc.). Finally, on the issue of desirability, there is little
guarantee that a revolution will lead to a better state of global
democracy. Revolutions are, by definition, disruptive. And although
capitalism comes with many problems, it is conceivable that the
revolutionary outcome of radical democracy may be more deleterious
than the current state of affairs.</p>

<h2 id="ModDemValDem">3. From &lsquo;Model of Democracy&rsquo; to &lsquo;Values of Democratization&rsquo;</h2>

<p>
The preceding five models provide a brief schematic of how global
democracy proposals have typically been crafted in the academic
literature. Subsequent to this move, however, global democratic
debates have taken a turn away from &lsquo;models&rsquo; toward
&lsquo;values of democratization&rsquo;. This section outlines the
core impetus behind this turn and its methodological foundation, and
then discusses several prominent examples in the literature.</p>

<h3 id="MetRat">3.1 Methodological Rationale</h3>

<p>
Democratic models, as should be clear, provide relatively
parsimonious, holistic, and idealized packages that can be pursued at
the global level. Archibugi et al. (2012) describe them as
&lsquo;terminal endpoints&rsquo; that can be strived toward. Although
some models provide more detailed and exact institutional design than
others, this general way of thinking has dominated global democracy
scholarship. However, as Dryzek (2008, 471) has contended, while
&ldquo;models help in thinking, they also constrain thinking.&rdquo;
As such, various authors have argued that global democracy can more
usefully be thought of as an on-going process of democratization in
which a set of values are more or less fulfilled.</p>

<p>
The core idea of this approach is that, instead of treating democracy
as an idealized set of institutions which need to be induced beyond
the state, we should think about the fundamental principles that
democracy demands and strive for them under existing conditions. Such
values may include inclusiveness, equality, popular control,
transparency, accountability, deliberation, or something else. These
values are supposed to be pursued in different institutional locations
by various actors in an on-going process. It does not demand any
specific &lsquo;end-point&rsquo; to work toward. Global politics is
more democratic the more these values are fulfilled. This approach has
several key methodological advantages over pursuing models of
democracy.</p>

<p>
First, democracy is often understood as an essentially contested
concept (Gallie 1956). Essential contestation does not just mean that
different models have different strengths and weaknesses that require
attention. Rather, it means that contestation over the meaning of
democracy is inherent to the concept itself. Because models provide a
holistic bundle of normative commitments and institutions, this is
often thought to undercut the dynamic nature of democracy-building
(Dryzek 2008). Moreover, because the international system is
pluralistic and complex, absolute agreement on any one model to pursue
seems unlikely. Focusing on how different democratic values arise in
different contexts helps to allay this concern.</p>

<p>
Second, engendering models of democracy beyond the state is often
derided as being infeasible. This argument stands on several
sub-claims (discussed above), but a general problem is that each model
of democracy was developed within the national context. As is fairly
obvious, the global system is not a state. As such, we cannot know in
advance which model is best suited to the global system, or how to go
about the initial stages of design. Although scholars such as Mathias
Koenig-Archibugi (2011) have done terrific and laborious work showing
how the necessary conditions for national democracy can all be met at
the global level, it might still be preferable to open our conception
of democracy and think about alternate ways, values, and procedures
that should be pursued.</p>

<p>
Finally, striving for values of democratization helps gain traction on
the non-ideal conditions of world politics. Models are, by definition,
idealizations and thinking about the transformative process toward any
ideal is fraught with difficulties about the nature of the future. In
this vein, Amartya Sen (2006) has recently argued that we should not
aim for the full realization of any specified model, but rather we
should seek to rank alternative values and arrangements derived from
the normative concept in question.. Erman (2012) has objected to the
notion that democracy can be treated as an aggregate concept composed
of different democratic values because it fails to recognize that the
different values are inter-related. While this is true, other scholars
have claimed that separating democracy into core values helps to
&ldquo;identify more clearly how different democratic values relate to
each other, to what extent they are in conflict and how such conflicts
should be resolved in particular circumstances&rdquo; (Dingwerth 2014,
18). As an aside, there remains a large dearth in the global democracy
literature surrounding the nature of methodological theorizing. Global
justice has focused intensely on the notions of ideal and non-ideal
theory and fleshing out how these different modes incorporate
feasibility and the pursuit of ends. Global democrats would be
well-served to address this literature head on (see, for instance,
Erman and Kuyper 2020).</p>

<h3 id="ExaLit">3.2 Examples in the Literature</h3>

<p>
There are many ways to think about pursuing values of democratization
in world politics. One prominent example comes from recent
international political theory and the work of Adrian Little and Kate
Macdonald (2013). These authors argue that the notion of
&lsquo;democratic practice&rsquo; should guide global reform. This
approach frees itself from &lsquo;institutionally-specific&rsquo;
goals and rather seeks &ldquo;a progressive process of
democratization&rdquo; (Little and Macdonald 2013, 749). These authors
identify political control and popular equality as requisite values
that should be employed to guide social critique and transformation.
To the extent that individuals have more equitable control over how
transnational political power is exercised, global democratization is
enhanced. A similar approach is employed by Terry Macdonald and Kate
Macdonald (2006) in their work on democratizing supply chain
governance. These authors argue that global politics can be
democratized through a series of decentralized, non-electoral
mechanisms that help reassert public control over decision-making.</p>

<p>
Values of democratization have also been promoted by international
lawyers (Cohen and Sabel 2006). Gr&aacute;inne de B&uacute;rca, in a
2008 article, advocates a &lsquo;democracy striving approach&rsquo;
which highlights the dynamic and inchoateness of democracy. The basic
idea is to identify the core principles (or &lsquo;building
blocks&rsquo;) of democracy and strive for those values beyond the
state. De B&uacute;rca (2008, 129&ndash;36) identifies political
equality, participation, and representation as key values. Nico
Krisch, in a book from 2010, has argued that international law can be
democratized by seeking accountability, deliberation, and contestation
in different issue spaces. Krisch suggests that the uneven and
fragmented terrain of global legal orders actually allow these values
to come to the fore, and underscores this argument through case study
analysis of the European Human Rights regime, UN Security Council
rulings on terrorism, and genetically modified food governance.</p>

<p>
Finally, several IR scholars have also contended that global affairs
can be democratized by pursuing democratic values in different ways.
Karin B&auml;ckstrand (2006), for instance, suggests that global
climate governance could be democratized through a stakeholder model
which blends deliberation, participation, and accountability. Jonathan
Kuyper (2014) argues that different issue areas of world politics can
likewise be democratized by pursuing values of equal participation,
accountability, and revisability. This argument is tested and
developed in the issue space of intellectual property rights
governance. Magdalena Bexell and her co-authors (2010) focus on the
values of participation and accountability in global governance and
document how non-state actors help induce (or undercut) these
desiderata. Kuyper and Squatrito (2017) have taken the &lsquo;values
of democratization&rsquo; approach and shown that international courts
can empirically substantiate several values (participation,
accountability, and justification) as well as documenting variation
across courts.</p>

<p>
Overall, the notion that world politics can be democratized by myriad
agents pursuing different democratic values in diverse fora has
emerged as a nascent way to think about reducing the global democratic
deficit. While this approach has clear benefits, it also comes with
complications. First, the lack of an institutional blueprint makes the
design process much more opaque than several of the models offered
previously. Second, it is not immediately clear why we should seek
some values over others and what we should do when values conflict
with one another. Finally, this approach might unnecessarily reify the
status quo. Without systematic and comparative analysis, proponents
risk &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; good examples that highlight how
democratic values can be attained while failing to elaborate how
really difficult situations can be transformed. This all indicates
that this turn in the literature requires further research.</p>

<h2 id="GloDemConEmpAss">4. Global Democracy: Conceptual and Empirical Assessments</h2>

<p>
It is now reasonable to argue that scholarship on global democracy has
undergone an empirical turn over the last decade (roughly). This work
has been backed-up by more conceptual and theoretic nuance regarding
global democracy&rsquo;s core features. While many throughout history
from Kant onwards have thought about the feasibility of global
democracy and/or a world state, recent work has sought to unpick the
precise conditions under which this might be possible. In doing so,
scholars invoke increasingly sophisticated methodological approaches.
This section documents some conceptual advancements made to the
possibility of global democracy as well as fleshing out some notable
empirical findings.</p>

<h3 id="GloDemConFou">4.1 Global Democracy: Conceptual Foundations</h3>

<p>
To begin, several scholars have developed more robust positions
relating global democracy in theory to its empirical preconditions.
Koenig-Archibugi, with Christian List, put forward an agency-based
account of the demos. Their central claim is that &ldquo;to function
as a demos, a collection of individuals must have the capacity to be
organized democratically in such a way as to function as a state-like
group agent (List and Koenig-Archibugi 2010, 110). This body must be
externally cohesive (identifiable as a collective) and internally
consistent (have the capacity to exercise collective decision-making).
Using the International Criminal Court as a case, they suggest that a
global demos is theoretically possible and empirically tractable
through transnational deliberation (though their argument is more
concerned with establishing the conceptual possibility of a global
demos rather than demonstrating its empirical existence).</p>

<p>
Congruent work has focused on the theoretical relationship between a
demos and the possibility of global democracy. Valentini (2014) has
argued against the &lsquo;no global demos, no global democracy&rsquo;
thesis. Her detailed article notes that mutual trust, ideological
cohesion and a convergence of interests between individuals is
necessary for democracy. Valentini demonstrates that while no current
global demos exists &ndash; thus precluding global democracy &ndash; a
global demos is neither infeasible or morally costly. The question
then becomes one of establishing the right preconditions and
transformative pathways. Lafont (2010), in a different but related
take, rightly criticizes Bohman for confusing democratic preconditions
with sufficient criteria for a well-functioning transnational
democracy. She argues that a vibrant global public sphere and minimum
set of rights are likely necessary for a functioning global democracy,
though leaves analysis of this potential to future work. Jonathan
White (2014) has suggested that transnational partisanship is both
empirically possible and conceptually part of movements toward global
democratization, though remains sceptical about the normative
desirability of parties in global democratic structures.</p>

<p>
Michael Z&uuml;rn (2016) has reconstructed four models of democracy
beyond the state - intergovernmental democratic states, cosmopolitan
pluralism, minimal world state, and cosmopolitan democracy &ndash; and
analyses their empirical suppositions. He assesses each model in light
of the global institutional context necessary for their realization,
potentialities for will formation, and individual attitudes for
democracy. He finds strongest support for cosmopolitan pluralism. A
model of intergovernmental democratic states struggles given that
individuals, according to most survey data, still prioritize national
issues over transnational ones, thus failing to promote global public
goods. A minimal world state would require transnational solidarity
which remains absent. Cosmopolitan democracy, which he treats as a
more fully-fledged world state, lacks public support for international
authority. Cosmopolitan pluralism, which seeks a diffusion of
multi-level power held to account by different democratic mechanisms
(i.e. civil society participation, human rights treaties, etc.) thus
seems most plausible.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, there remains space for thinking about the possible
features global democracy could take and the corresponding necessary
conditions for these institutional forms to emerge. This work should
also address the literature on feasibility, as noted above.</p>

<h3 id="GloDemEmpTes">4.2 Global Democracy: Empirical Tests</h3>

<p>
More recent work has sought to test empirically whether preconditions
for democracy exist beyond the state. While limited work has used
empirical preconditions to establish conceptual possibilities for
global democracy, this research centres on the concrete (i.e.,
existing) conditions of world politics and their relationship to
global democratization.</p>

<p>
In general, this literature is responding to a long-standing critique.
Many prominent scholars have suggested that empirical realities make
global democracy a non-starter. Joseph Nye (2002: 17), in an early
piece, claimed that &ldquo;treating the world as one global
constituency implies the existence of a political community in which
citizens of around 200 states would be willing to be continually
outvoted by more than a billion Chinese and a billion Indians&rdquo;.
Robert Dahl (1999) remarked that global institutions are simply too
remote from individual citizens to enable meaningful participation.
David Miller (2010) averred that public appetite for global democracy
is absent, making the &lsquo;idea itself&rsquo; problematic. Yunker
(2011) has explicitly argued that the notion of a world government is
rejected by majority of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>

<p>
Koenig-Archibugi (2011) , in a foundational piece on the empirical
potential of global democracy, separates between necessary and
favourable conditions for democracy. He canvasses literature on
domestic democratization for said necessary conditions and examines
stateness, cultural homogeneity, economic prosperity, economic
inequality, and size. Using India as a case-study, Koenig-Archibugi
shows that none of these factors would theoretically preclude a global
democracy (of some sort or another).</p>

<p>
In a follow-up piece, Thomas Hale and Koenig-Archibugi (2019) assess
whether citizens across the globe are too heterogeneously spaced
(i.e., diverse) or polarized on policy issues to form a coherent
democracy. Statistically analysing opinion polls covering a
representative sample of 86% of the world population, these scholars
demonstrate that global policy preferences are within the same range
as the diversity found within nation-states. This suggests that global
democracy is possible to the same extent it is within the national
container, at least on the variables analyzed in their study.</p>

<p>
Other work has focused more on assessing citizen views towards IOs
legitimacy and, inversely, efforts by IOs to dampen their own
democratic deficit(s). Matthias Ecker-Ehrhardt (2018) has employed
event history analysis to show that&mdash;from 1950 to 2015&mdash;48
IOs have sought to follow an emerging democratic norm of transparency
in response to scandals and public contestation This goes a long way
to establishing Z&uuml;rn et al.&rsquo;s (2012) hypothesis on why
IOs&mdash;which become politicized&mdash;will require stocks of
legitimacy to dampen contestation. Ecker-Ehrhardt (2012) has, through
a representative sample of German citizens, eliminated cognitive
mobilization as a necessary condition of global democratization by
establishing that citizens put moral and political faith in IOs to
solve problems that their own government cannot. The generalizability
of this finding remains up for debate.</p>

<p>
Ghassim, Koenig-Archibugi, and Cabrera (2022), in one of the most
direct tests of global democratic reforms, employ a population-based
conjoint survey experiment conducted in Argentina, China, India,
Russia, Spain, and the United States. They find strong support for the
UNSC maintaining authority over nation-states, but also support for
diversifying authority to other UN organs in which citizen input would
be more pronounced. The most elaborate study of empirical support for
global democracy comes from Ghassim and Pauli (2024) in which they
argue that a majority of citizens support some form of democracy
(drawn from Brazil, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
States). This is conditioned by individual perceptions surrounding the
necessity of IOs to solve collective action problems and party cues
(though mostly in single-member district systems, not proportional
systems).</p>

<p>
Another strand of research has empirically documented that IOs are
becoming more democratic in their rhetoric. One subset of this work
has shown that national parliaments in the EU are increasingly likely
to contain Member of Parliament speeches which make representative
claims of citizens in other, interdependent states during times of
crisis (Kinski 2018). She demonstrates this phenomenon across Austria,
Germany, and Ireland, especially from left-wing Eurosceptic parties.
Dingwerth et al. (2019) undertake a regression analysis of 20
cross-regional IOs, over the time period 1980&ndash;2011, increasingly
justify their authority by reference to democratic standards instead
of functional (problem-solving) grounds. Like Z&uuml;rn et al. (2012)
and Ecker-Ehrhardt (2018), this dependent variable is driven by public
visibility and protests compounded by path-depended feedback effects
locking in democratic legitimation language. On this same point,
Tobias Lenz and Henning Schmidtke (2023) draw on a novel dataset of
32000 paragraphs of text published by 28 regional IOs between 1980 and
2019 to establish statistically that IOs seek discursive legitimation
to target diverse audiences, seek to cohere audience beliefs about the
rightfulness of their own rule, and match peer IO behaviour.</p>

<p>
Though only tangentially related to democratic legitimacy, Jonas
Tallberg and his co-authors have undertaken exemplary research
studying citizen and elite views of the legitimacy of IOs (Dellmuth et
al. 2022). They find that both groups vary in their assessment of
&lsquo;how appropriate&rsquo; actors find a variety of international
organizations. This variation is driven by socioeconomic status,
political values, geographical identification, and domestic
institutional trust. In general, elites find IOs more legitimate than
their counterpart citizens along the aforementioned criteria. This,
however, only measures sociological legitimacy (a belief in the
appropriateness of an institution), not normative (or, more narrowly)
democratic legitimacy. The former may be a precondition of the latter,
but only through a more robust conception of democratic legitimacy
could we gain traction on the implications for global democracy. In an
alternate study, but tapping into some similar issues, Parizek and
Stephen (2021) use panel regression to assess the secretariats of
thirty-five United Nations system bodies from 1997 to 2015. They show
that normative pressure for equal representation is pronounced,
especially for visible (i.e., politicized) IOs.</p>

<p>
In a particularly ambitious book-length treatise, Hans Agn&eacute; has
sought to operationalize democracy beyond the state &ndash; measured
in part by the representativeness of IOs and equality of social power
&ndash; to develop (in his words) democratism as an explanatory
variable of international and domestic outcomes. This approach takes
some form of global democracy as already existing and puts it to
causal use and is the first study (known to the author) treating
global democracy as an independent variable to reorient existing IR
debates.</p>

<p>
Overall, this empirical turn is burgeoning (see Afran 2025 for an
overview of recent monograph treatments). We have substantial data
showing that many preconditions of democracy are met at the global
level (and that some previously-thought preconditions may be
unnecessary), that IOs seek to legitimate themselves in terms of
democratic reform/language, and that this is in line with&mdash;and
response to&mdash;citizen preferences. We also have good evidence that
citizen demand for legitimacy can trigger democratization efforts, and
that democracy beyond the state may take different shapes. While
studies in this space are almost uniformly positive in their view that
global democracy is empirically possible, some works have criticized
the empirical possibilities of global democracy exist. Gaspardo and
Carvalho (2025), examining democratization efforts in global financial
governance, show that the BRICS states make democratic efforts less
likely. Z&uuml;rn, as discussed above, looks at data from
Eurobarometer and other sources to show that individuals are still
more nationally-oriented and are wary of international authority, and
applies this as a constructive critique of different global democracy
models.</p>

<p>
As a result, there remains much work to be done, scrutinizing existing
studies on global democracy&rsquo;s preconditions from both proponents
and critics. Further studies should engage with a wider representative
sample of citizens from across the globe, different international
organizations, and test the quality of different normative
models/values on citizen preferences for global democracy. This
empirical knowledge should then be rolled back in to ongoing and
incipient normative research moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="PerCriFutRes">5. Persistent Criticisms and Future Research</h2>

<p>
Although democracy is widely regarded as an ideal worth attaining,
critics of global democracy have been numerous and persistent (Miller
1995; Dahl 1999; Moravcsik 2004). A variety of strong objections have
been raised to the fundamental project of global democracy, as well as
specific criticisms about institutional proposals and methodology. It
is not possible to undertake a survey of all criticisms in the
literature (and several core issues have already been discussed in the
previous sections). This section, however, will outline three core
issues that global democrats need to grapple with in current and
future research.</p>

<h3 id="ReaGloPol">5.1 Realism and Global Politics</h3>

<p>
Scholarship on global democracy is often charged with failing to deal
with issues of power. This is particularly problematic because IR
theorists have, for many years, highlighted the anarchical and
power-laden nature of international politics (Morgenthau 1954). This
view is especially prominent among realists and neo-realists who claim
that states are the fundamental units of world politics, and that
power&mdash;understood as material capabilities&mdash;is the main
currency of transnational interaction. Drawing parallels with
Hobbes&rsquo;s state of nature, realists argue that anarchy forces
each state into a situation of self-help which, in turn, creates
security dilemmas as states seek to defend their sovereign borders.
International institutions, when they do exist, reflect the prevailing
distribution of power and the interests of dominant states. Although
neo-liberal theorists (such as Robert Keohane) and constructivists
(such as Alexander Wendt) have argued that cooperation between states
can be attained under anarchy, these camps still agree that power
politics dominates transnational affairs.</p>

<p>
Global democracy, as should be clear, requires the equal inclusion of
individuals in transnational decision-making processes. For most IR
theorists, this is simply impossible. States are the key players in
world politics, and individuals have standing only through their
national political system. Although Pareto optimal (i.e.
mutually-beneficial) forms of international cooperation can occur in
world politics, states will always strive for more power and exploit
relative differentials in material capabilities to fulfil national
preferences. The drive and desire of each national government to
maximize their absolute and relative power vis-&agrave;-vis other
states directly undercuts the cosmopolitan ideal upon which global
democracy is (typically) predicated.</p>

<p>
Although realist theories have much explanatory power, neo-liberal and
constructivist scholars increasingly point to the constraining nature
of law and ideas in world politics. Constructivists, in particular,
have forcefully noted that &lsquo;anarchy is what states make of
it&rsquo; (Wendt 2003, 491). In other words, the realist
interpretation of world politics is precisely that: a cultural and
historical interpretation. The fundamental nature of international
society can and does change over time, and therefore new forms of
social and political interactions are always possible. This suggests
that power politics is not some immutable condition of international
affairs, but rather a situation that can be overcome through new forms
of cognition, cooperation, and contestation. As such, cosmopolitan
notions of global democracy are certainly conceivable. As Linklater
(1998) argues, emerging dialogical communities of affected peoples are
creating transnational social relations that are more universalistic,
less unequal, and have greater sensitivity to cultural
differences.</p>

<p>
As noted above, Wendt (2003) &ndash; a key figure in the IR
constructivist movement &ndash; has argued that a world state is
actually inevitable. While this argument stands in contradistinction
to his constructivist disposition, his teleological argument is worth
grappling with. In his understanding, a world state with coercive
(military) will emerge through mutual recognition, equality, and a
constitutional order. It is hard to see, given human experience under
a social contract, that many (most?) individuals would not demand some
form of democracy to undergird and legitimate this authority. Luke
Ula&#351; (2016), in a somewhat connected claim, suggests that any
form of global democracy necessitates a world state. He bases this
supposition on the idea that economic self-interest, prudent
self-interest and democratic self-interest &ndash; put to cosmopolitan
ends &ndash; will require global political integration akin to a world
state.</p>

<p>
A related avenue for research is also available for global democrats.
The normative project of global democratization &ndash; especially
those seeking to replicate liberal democratic institutions above the
state (i.e., world parliaments) &ndash; is rightly critiqued on
neo-colonial or imperialist grounds for taking Western institutions as
the benchmark for legitimate global authority (Held and Patom&auml;ki
2006; Cabrera 2015). However, much work in IR now points to the fact
that anarchy is the wrong starting point for theorizing world
politics. Instead, we should begin with the concept of hierarchy.
Mattern and Zarakol (2016) have persuasively demonstrated that
international authority generates hierarchies. This form of authority,
as explicated by Z&uuml;rn et al. (2012), is likely best legitimated
through taking public preferences into account and providing
justification for policies. More foundationally, though, Mattern and
Zarakol point to economic, social (status), and political sources of
hierarchy. This analysis opens up for studying a wider variety of
actors as well as their motivations. To the extent that hierarchies
could be uncovered and equalized, emergent forms of democracy could be
pinpointed. This broader literature persuasively shows that
hierarchies are intersubjective constructions. As far as this is true,
there is no a priori reason why their form could not be democratized.
This stands as a direction for future research.</p>

<p>
In sum, global democrats would do well to tackle more directly issues
of power politics and engage with core debates in IR. This may allow
for insights to be shed on both topics. IR schools&mdash;such as
realism, neo-realism, neo-liberalism, constructivism, and
communicative action&mdash;have traditionally been concerned with
social-scientific, historical, and explanatory analysis. These camps
have been less willing or able to question their own normative
underpinnings or offer critical prescriptions for future design.
Inversely, global democrats have had a predominantly normative
orientation, but neglected to engage rigorously with social-scientific
methodology or make full use of the empirical analysis offered by IR
scholars. As such, fruitful cross-fertilization may be possible as we
seek to understand how normative values can be pursued under existing
conditions of material differentials where the threat of international
and civil war, climate change disaster, financial crises, and many
other issues still loom large.</p>

<h3 id="GloDemLegJus">5.2 Global Democracy, Legitimacy, and Justice</h3>

<p>
It is not just IR scholars who have accused global democrats of
failing to deal adequately with issues of power. Increasingly within
the broader field of normative international political theory, there
is recognition that questions of power and conflict have been
relegated in favor of global justice (Beitz 1979). Of course, global
democrats are fundamentally interested in how transnational
decision-making is exercised and who has a democratic say in the
formulation of rules and norms. But these issues are often eclipsed by
issues of poverty, resource distribution, and inequality (Pogge
1992).</p>

<p>
When global democrats tackle the notion of power, they do so through a
specific lens: they are interested, predominantly, in how &lsquo;the
people&rsquo; can collectively rule themselves and potentially check
the exercise of arbitrary power (Bohman 2007). Recently, several
scholars have complained that this focus is too narrow to take proper
consideration of how power can be legitimated within the global
system. Macdonald and Ronzoni (2012), following in the footsteps of
Bernard Williams, suggest that legitimacy may be a value separable
from&mdash;and not reducible to&mdash;democracy or justice. As such,
we need to think about different ways of legitimating global power
that take seriously the unique context of world politics. This might
entail looking at values such as stability, sociological acceptance,
juridification, or arbitration. Analyzing how these standards foster
legitimacy in transnational institutions may actually help shed light
on the fundamental constitutive features of the global political order
(Macdonald and Ronzoni 2012, 525) and the limits of global
democratization.</p>

<p>
At any rate, much work remains to think about how justice, democracy,
and legitimacy intersect and diverge in both theoretical and empirical
terms (Dingwerth 2014). This will entail looking at whether the
current arrangements of international institutions are sufficiently
strong to trigger demands of justice, democracy, or both (Nagel 2005;
Sangiovanni 2007). It will also require analysis of legitimacy as a
separable virtue of global political institutions with its own
character and composition that may only tangentially relate to
democracy. Different issue-areas of might require their own form of
&lsquo;practice-dependent&rsquo; democratization (Sangiovanni, 2016).
Work on practice-dependence &ndash; the notion that existing
institutional forms might not just condition feasibility but also the
justifiability of normative demands &ndash; is prevalent in the global
justice literature but remains absent from work on global democracy.
These future directions for research&mdash;as well as many of the
other issues addressed in this review &ndash; should ensure that
global democracy remains an active, vibrant, and important field of
practice and study in years to come.</p>

<h3 id="GloDemBacPopBac">5.3 Global Democracy, Backsliding, and Populist Backlashes</h3>

<p>
A final point concerns the relationship between global democracy and
national democratic backsliding. This latter phenomenon is being
driven, largely, by populists of different varieties: authoritarian,
technocratic, and so on. According to Nord et al. 2025 (see the Other
Internet Resources), the number of individual citizens living in a
democracy has declined over the last few years.  Populists and
straightforward autocrats have been able to reverse democratic norms,
stall majoritarian institutions, and erode constitutions/human rights
across many corners of the globe.</p>

<p>
This advent has relied, very frequently, upon attacking &lsquo;the
elite&rsquo; in defence of &lsquo;the people&rsquo;. Though not
always, often the targeted &lsquo;elite&rsquo; are leaders of IOs from
the EU to the WTO and beyond (Inglehart and Norris 2017). This
phenomenon is evident from multiple national (populist) leaders from
Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines, to the US. Empirically, to give one
example, Erik Voeten (2020) has shown that national politicians are
able to effectively target the authority of international courts to
prime domestic audience to their populist views with much success
(though following through on attacks and having too thin an ideology
mediates this effect). At any rate, populist leaders and
authoritarians are seeking to recapture political power from the
international realm and install it at the domestic level under the
guise of sovereignty &lsquo;for the people&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
This presents two intertwined challenges and opportunities for global
democrats of all stripes. On one hand, a world of globalization will
cause contestation. The task here is to show that some of the
contestation of globalization can trigger the democratization of IOs
and limit the power of elites (as discussed above). Therein lies an
opportunity to deepen democracy beyond the state. On the other,
populists will likely continue presenting sovereignty and IO authority
as mutually-exclusive, drumming up nationalistic support for
&lsquo;the people&rsquo; at the expense of interdependence (Moffitt
2016). It is the task of normative international political theory to
counteract this position as well. By showing that IOs can reinforce
the &lsquo;will of the people&rsquo; &ndash; and therefore sovereignty
&ndash; an offensive position can be retained (Lafont 2016). It is
then key to establish that global democracy is possible, the
likelihood of different models/values, and reassert the desirability
of democracy beyond the state both intrinsically &ndash; modelling
rule of the people &ndash; and instrumentally &ndash; in securing
efficient outcomes, solving collective action problems, and quelling
populist attacks on democracy itself.</p>
