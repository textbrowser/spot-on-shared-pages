<div id="preamble">

<p>
William of Ockham (c. 1287&ndash;1347) is among the most prominent
figures in the history of philosophy during the Late Middle Ages along
with Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus. He is probably best known
today for his espousal of metaphysical nominalism. Indeed, the
principle known as &ldquo;Ockham&rsquo;s Razor&rdquo; is named after
him. But Ockham held important, often influential views not only in
metaphysics but also in all other major areas of medieval
philosophy&mdash;logic, physics or natural philosophy, theory of
knowledge, ethics, and political philosophy&mdash;as well as in
theology.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>
Ockham led an unusually eventful life for a philosopher. As with so
many medieval figures who were not prominent when they were born, we
know little about the circumstances of Ockham&rsquo;s birth and early
years, and have to estimate dates by extrapolating from known dates of
events later in his
 life.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s life may be divided into three main periods.</p>

<h3 id="EnglC1287">1.1 England (c. 1287&ndash;1324)</h3>

<p>
Ockham was born probably in late 1287 or early 1288, in the village of
Ockham (= Oak Hamlet) in Surrey. He likely learned basic Latin at a
village school in Ockham or nearby, but this is not
 certain.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 At an early age, somewhere between seven and thirteen, Ockham was
&ldquo;given&rdquo; to the Franciscan Order (the so-called
 &ldquo;Greyfriars&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 There was no Franciscan house (called a &ldquo;convent&rdquo;) in the
tiny village of Ockham itself; the nearest was in London. It was there
that Ockham was sent.</p>

<p>
As an educational institution, even for higher education, London
Greyfriars was a distinguished place. At London Greyfriars, Ockham
probably got most of his early education, and then went on to what we
might think of as a secondary school education in basic logic and
science (i.e., natural philosophy), beginning around the age of
fourteen.</p>

<p>
Around 1310, when he was about twenty-three, Ockham began his
theological training. It is not certain where this occurred. It could
well have been at London Greyfriars, or it could have been at Oxford,
where there was another Franciscan convent associated with the
University. In any event, Ockham was in Oxford studying theology by at
least the year 1318&ndash;19, and probably the previous year as well,
when, in 1317, he began a required two-year cycle of lectures
commenting on Peter Lombard&rsquo;s <em>Sentences,</em> the standard
theological textbook of the day. Then, probably in 1321, Ockham
returned to London Greyfriars. Although he had taken initial steps in
the theology faculty at Oxford (hence his nickname, the
<em>Venerabilis Inceptor</em>, &ldquo;Venerable Beginner&rdquo;),
Ockham did not complete his studies there, and never became a fully
qualified master of theology at Oxford. Nevertheless, London
Greyfriars was an intellectually lively place, and Ockham was by no
means isolated from academic debate. He lived there with two other
important Franciscan thinkers, Walter Chatton and Adam Wodeham, both
sharp critics of Ockham&rsquo;s views. It was in this context that
Ockham wrote many of his most important philosophical and theological
works.</p>

<p>
In 1323 Ockham was called before the Franciscan province&rsquo;s
chapter meeting held that year in Bristol to defend a number of his
views that were regarded with suspicion by some of his confreres.
About the same time, someone&mdash;it is not clear who&mdash;went from
England to the papal court at Avignon and charged Ockham with teaching
 heresy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 As a result, a commission of theologians was set up to study the
case. Ockham was called to Avignon in May, 1324 to answer the charges.
He never went back to England.</p>

<h3 id="Avig1324">1.2 Avignon (1324&ndash;28)</h3>

<p>
While in Avignon, Ockham stayed at the Franciscan convent. It has
sometimes been suggested that he was effectively under house arrest,
but this seems an exaggeration. On the contrary, he appears to have
been free to do more or less as he pleased while staying in the city.
The investigation must not have demanded much of Ockham&rsquo;s own
time, since he was able to work on a number of other projects while he
was in Avignon, including finishing his last major theological work,
the <em>Quodlibets</em>. It should be pointed out that, although some
stern pronouncements came out of the investigation, his views were
never officially condemned as heretical.</p>

<p>
In 1327, Michael of Cesena, the Franciscan minister general (the chief
administrative officer of the order) likewise came to Avignon, in his
case because of a controversy between the Franciscans and the current
pope, John XXII, over the idea of Apostolic poverty. This was the idea
that Jesus and the Apostles owned no property of their own and had
lived off the generosity of others by begging. The mendicant
Franciscans also refused all property ownership, maintaining that
their own practices were a special form of the &ldquo;imitation of
Christ&rdquo;. Pope John XXII rejected the doctrine, which is why
Michael of Cesena was in Avignon.</p>

<p>
The crisis came to a climax in 1328, when Michael and the Pope had a
serious confrontation over the matter. As a result, Michael asked
Ockham to study the question from the point of view of previous papal
statements and John&rsquo;s own previous writings on the subject. When
he did so, Ockham came to the conclusion that John&rsquo;s view was
not simply wrong but heretical. John&rsquo;s heresy consisted in the
fact that he stubbornly maintained his view <em>even after he had been
shown it was wrong</em>. As a result, Ockham argued, Pope John was not
just teaching heresy, but was a heretic himself and had, therefore,
effectively abdicated his papacy. In short, Pope John XXII was no pope
at all!</p>

<h3 id="Muni1328">1.3 Munich (1328/29&ndash;47)</h3>

<p>
On the night of May 26, 1328, Michael of Cesena, Ockham, and a few
other sympathetic Franciscans fled Avignon and went into exile. They
initially went to Italy, where Ludwig of Bavaria, the Holy Roman
Emperor, was in Pisa at the time along with his court and retinue.
Ludwig was engaged in a political dispute with the Pope, and
Ockham&rsquo;s group found refuge under his protection. On June 6,
1328, Ockham was officially excommunicated for leaving Avignon without
permission. Around 1329, Ludwig returned to Munich, together with
Michael, Ockham and the rest of their fugitive band. Ockham stayed
there, or at any rate in areas under imperial control, until his
death. During this time, Ockham wrote exclusively on political
 matters.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 He died on the night of April 9/10, 1347, at roughly the age of
sixty.</p>

<h2 id="Writ">2. Writings</h2>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s writings are conventionally divided into two groups:
the so-called &ldquo;academic&rdquo; and &ldquo;political&rdquo;
writings. By and large, the former were written or at least begun
while Ockham was still in England, while the latter were written
toward the end of Ockham&rsquo;s Avignon period and later in exile.
All of his writings are now available in modern critical editions and
many are translated into English, in whole or in
 part.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 The academic writings are in turn divided into two groups: the
&ldquo;theological&rdquo; and &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; works,
although both groups are essential for the study of Ockham&rsquo;s
philosophy. Many of his distinctive metaphysical, epistemological, and
ethical views are found in the theological works.</p>

<p>
Among Ockham&rsquo;s most important writings, listed chronologically,
are:</p>

lectures, taken down by a &ldquo;reporter&rdquo;, without the benefit
of later revisions or corrections by the author.</li>

</ul> </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="LogiSema">3. Logic and Semantics</h2>

<p>
Ockham is rightly regarded as one of the most important logicians of
the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, his originality and influence should
not be exaggerated. For all his deserved reputation, his logical views
are sometimes
 derivative<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 and occasionally very
 idiosyncratic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Logic, for Ockham, is crucial to the advancement of knowledge. In the
&ldquo;Prefatory Letter&rdquo; to his <em>Summa of Logic,</em> for
example, he praises it in striking language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For logic is the most useful tool of all the arts. Without it no
science can be fully known. It is not worn out by repeated use, after
the manner of material tools, but rather admits of continual growth
through the diligent exercise of any other science. For just as a
mechanic who lacks a complete knowledge of his tool gains a fuller
[knowledge] by using it, so one who is educated in the firm principles
of logic, while he painstakingly devotes his labor to the other
sciences, acquires at the same time a greater skill at this art.
(<em>SL</em>, Epist. Prooem., <em>OPh</em> I, p. 6. Translation by
Spade)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s main logical writings consist of a series of
commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s and Porphyry&rsquo;s logical works,
plus his own <em>Summa of Logic,</em> his masterwork. His <em>Treatise
on Predestination</em> contains an influential theory on the logic of
future contingent propositions, and other works as well include
occasional discussions of logical topics, notably his
<em>Quodlibets</em>.</p>

<h3 id="SummLogi">3.1 The <em>Summa of Logic</em></h3>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s <em>Summa of Logic</em> is divided into three books,
with the third book subdivided into four parts. Book I divides
language in accordance with Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On
Interpretation</em> (1, 16<sup>a</sup>3&ndash;8, as influenced by
Boethius&rsquo;s interpretation), into written, spoken and mental
language, with written language dependent on spoken language that is
in turn dependent on mental language. Mental language, the language of
thought, is thus the most primitive and basic level of language. Book
I goes on to lay out a fairly detailed theory of terms, including the
distinctions between (a) categorematic and syncategorematic terms, (b)
abstract and concrete terms, and (c) absolute and connotative terms.
Book I concludes with a discussion of the five
&ldquo;predicables&rdquo; or universals from Porphyry&rsquo;s
<em>Isagoge</em> and of Aristotle&rsquo;s ten categories.</p>

<p>
While Book I is about terms, Book II is about propositions
(<em>propositiones</em>), which are made up of terms. Book II gives a
systematic and nuanced theory of truth conditions for the four
traditional kinds of assertoric categorical propositions on the
&ldquo;Square of Opposition&rdquo;, and then goes on to tensed, modal,
and more complicated categorical propositions, as well as a variety of
&ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo; (molecular) propositions. The vehicle for
this account of truth conditions is the semantic theory of
supposition, which will be explained below. Book III is about
arguments, which are made up of propositions made up of terms. It is
divided into four parts. Book III-1 treats syllogisms, and includes a
comprehensive theory of modal
 syllogistic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Book III-2 concerns demonstrative syllogisms in particular. Book
III-3 is in effect Ockham&rsquo;s theory of consequence, although it
also includes discussions of semantic paradoxes like the Liar (the
so-called <em>insolubilia</em>) and of the still little-understood
disputation form known as &ldquo;obligation&rdquo;. Book III-4 is a
discussion of fallacies.</p>

<p>
Thus, while the <em>Summa of Logic</em> is not in any sense a
commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s logical writings, it nevertheless
covers all the traditional ground in the traditional order:
Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em> and Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em> in Book I, <em>On Interpretation</em> in Book II,
<em>Prior Analytics</em> in Book III-1, <em>Posterior Analytics</em>
in Book III-2, <em>Topics</em> (and much else) in Book III-3, and
finally <em>Sophistical Refutations</em> in Book III-4.</p>

<h3 id="SignSupp">3.2 Signification and Supposition</h3>

<p>
Book I of the <em>Summa of Logic</em> introduces a number of semantic
notions that play an important role throughout much of Ockham&rsquo;s
philosophy. None of these notions is original to Ockham, although he
develops them with great sophistication and employs them with
skill.</p>

<p>
The most basic such notion is signification. In medieval philosophy, a
term signifies <em>what it makes us think of</em>. This notion of
signification was unanimously accepted. Although there was great
dispute over <em>what</em> terms signified, there was agreement over
the
 criterion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Ockham, unlike many (but no means all) other medieval logicians, held
that terms do not in general signify our thoughts, but can signify
anything at all (including things not presently existing). The
function of language, therefore, is not so much to communicate
thoughts from one mind to another, but to convey information about the
world.</p>

<p>
In <em>Summa of Logic</em> I, 33, Ockham acknowledges four different
kinds of signification. In the first sense, a term signifies whatever
things it is truly predicable of by means of a present-tensed,
assertoric copula. That is, a term <em>t</em> signifies a thing
<em>x</em> if and only if &lsquo;This is a <em>t</em>&rsquo; is true,
pointing to <em>x</em>. In the second sense, <em>t</em> signifies
<em>x</em> if and only if &lsquo;This is (or was, or will be, or can
be) a <em>t</em>&rsquo; is true, pointing to
 <em>x.</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 These first two senses of signification are together called
&ldquo;primary&rdquo; signification.</p>

<p id="connotation">
In the third sense, terms can also be said to signify certain things
they are <em>not</em> truly predicable of, no matter the tense or
modality of the copula. For instance, the word &lsquo;brave&rsquo; not
only makes us think of brave people (whether presently existing or
not); it also makes us think of the <em>bravery</em> in virtue of
which we call them &ldquo;brave&rdquo;. Thus, &lsquo;brave&rsquo;
signifies and is truly predicable of brave people, but also signifies
bravery, even though it is not truly predicable of bravery, since
bravery is not brave. This kind of signification is called
&ldquo;secondary&rdquo; signification. For a first approximation, we
can say that a &ldquo;connotative&rdquo; term is just a term that has
a secondary signification, and that such a connotative term
&ldquo;connotes&rdquo; exactly what it secondarily signifies. Roughly
put, being somewhat over-simplified, connotation is secondary
signification. The fourth sense, finally, is the broadest one,
according to which any linguistic unit, including a whole sentence,
can be said to signify whatever things it makes us think of in some
way or other. A sentence signifies in this sense whatever it is that
its terms primarily or secondarily signify.</p>

<p>
The theory of supposition was the centerpiece of late medieval
semantic theory. Supposition is not the same as signification. First
of all, terms signify wherever we encounter them, whereas they have
supposition only in the context of a proposition. But the differences
go beyond that. Whereas signification is a psychological, cognitive
relation, the theory of supposition is, at least in part, a theory of
reference. For Ockham, there are three main kinds of
 supposition<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>:</p>
 
<ul>

<li>Personal supposition, in which a term supposits for (refers to)
what it signifies in either of the first two senses of signification
described above. For example, in &lsquo;Every dog is a mammal&rsquo;,
both &lsquo;dog&rsquo; and &lsquo;mammal&rsquo; have personal
supposition.</li>

<li>Simple supposition, in which a term supposits for a concept, which
it does not signify. Thus, in &lsquo;Dog is a species&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Dog is a universal&rsquo;, the subject &lsquo;dog&rsquo; has
simple supposition. For Ockham the nominalist, the only real
universals are universal concepts in the mind and, derivatively,
universal spoken or written terms expressing those concepts.</li>

<li>Material supposition, in which a term supposits for a spoken or
written expression, which it does not signify. Thus, in &lsquo;Dog has
three letters&rsquo;, the subject &lsquo;dog&rsquo; has material
 supposition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></li>
 </ul>

<p>
Personal supposition, which was the main focus, was divided into
various sub-kinds, distinguished in terms of a theory of
&ldquo;descent to singulars&rdquo; and &ldquo;ascent from
singulars&rdquo;. A quick example will give the flavor: In
&ldquo;Every dog is a mammal&rdquo;, &lsquo;dog&rsquo; is said to have
&ldquo;confused and distributive&rdquo; personal supposition insofar
as</p>

<ul>

<li>It is possible to &ldquo;descend to singulars&rdquo; as follows:
&ldquo;Every dog is a mammal; therefore, Fido is a mammal, and Rover
is a mammal, and Bowser is a mammal &hellip;&rdquo;, and so on for all
dogs.</li>

<li>It is <em>not</em> possible to &ldquo;ascend from any one
singular&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;Fido is a mammal; therefore, every
dog is a mammal&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although the mechanics of this part of supposition theory are well
understood in Ockham and in other authors, its exact purpose remains
an open question.</p>

<h3 id="MentLangConnDefi">3.3 Mental Language, Connotation, and Definitions</h3>

<p>
Ockham was the first philosopher to develop in some detail the notion
of mental language and to put it to work for him. Aristotle, Boethius
and several others had mentioned it before, but Ockham&rsquo;s
innovation was to systematically transpose to the fine-grained
analysis of human thought both the grammatical categories of his time,
such as those of noun, verb, adverb, singular, plural and so on,
and&mdash;even more importantly&mdash;the central semantical ideas of
signification, connotation, and supposition introduced in the previous
 section.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Written words for him are &ldquo;subordinated&rdquo; to spoken words,
and spoken words in turn are &ldquo;subordinated&rdquo; to mental
units called &ldquo;concepts&rdquo;, which can be combined into
syntactically structured mental propositions, just as spoken and
written words can be combined into audible or visible sentences.</p>

<p>
Whereas the signification of terms in spoken and written language is
purely conventional and can be changed by mutual agreement (hence
English speakers say &lsquo;dog&rsquo; whereas French speakers say
&lsquo;<em lang="fr">chien</em>&rsquo;), the signification of mental
terms is established by nature according to Ockham, and cannot be
changed at will. Concepts, in other words, are <em>natural signs</em>:
my concept of dog naturally signifies dogs. How natural signification
is to be accounted for in the final analysis is not entirely clear,
but it seems to be based both on the fact that simple concepts are
normally caused within the mind by their objects (my simple concept of
dog originated in me as an effect of my perceptual encounter with
dogs), and on the fact that concepts are in some way &ldquo;naturally
similar&rdquo; to their
 objects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A great deal of modern secondary literature has been devoted to a
question regarding mental language. On Ockham&rsquo;s account, two
simple terms (whether from the same or different spoken or written
languages) are <em>synonymous</em> if they are ultimately subordinated
to the same concept. A single given term of spoken or written language
is <em>equivocal</em> if it is ultimately subordinated to more than
one concept. Is there equivocation and synonymy in mental language?
The debate generated by this question was important not only because
it broached how best to characterize Ockham&rsquo;s mental language,
but more broadly it called into question the success of Ockham&rsquo;s
so-called &ldquo;nominalist program&rdquo;, that is, his presumed aim
of carrying out a semantic reduction of terms in lockstep with an
ontological reduction of things in the world to the fullest extent
possible.</p>

<p>
One interpretation had it that there is no synonymy or equivocation in
mental language, with the consequence, so it was argued, that
Ockham&rsquo;s mental language is a kind of lean, stripped down,
&ldquo;canonical&rdquo; language with no frills or inessentials
comparable to the &ldquo;ideal languages&rdquo; postulated by logical
atomists in the first part of the twentieth
 century.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 This interpretation was challenged by a second interpretation
according to which Ockham&rsquo;s mental language is <em>not</em> a
logically ideal language, but incorporates some redundancies and
 ambiguities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
What was at stake? Let us return briefly to the theory of
 connotation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 <a href="#connotation">Connotation was described above</a> in terms of primary and secondary signification. But in
<em>Summa of Logic</em> I, 10, Ockham draws the distinction between
absolute and connotative terms by means of the theory of definition.
For Ockham, there are two kinds of definitions: <em>real</em>
definitions and <em>nominal</em> definitions. A real definition is
supposed to reveal the essential metaphysical structure of what the
defined term signifies, while nominal definitions do not. As Ockham
sets it up, all <em>connotative</em> terms have nominal definitions,
never real definitions, and <em>absolute</em> terms have real
definitions, never nominal definitions (some absolute terms have no
definitions at
 all<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>).</p>
 
<p>
As an example of a real definition, consider: &ldquo;a human being is
a rational animal&rdquo; or &ldquo;a human being is a substance
composed of a body and an intellective soul&rdquo;. Each of these
definitions expresses in its own way the essential metaphysical
structure of a human being. But, the two definitions do not signify
exactly the same things. The first makes us think of rational things
plus animals. The second makes us think of substances plus bodies and
souls. An absolute term, e.g., &lsquo;human being&rsquo;, can have
several real definitions that do not always signify exactly the same
things. They will <em>primarily</em> signify&mdash;be truly predicable
of&mdash;exactly the same things, i.e., human beings, since they will
primarily signify just what the term they define, i.e., &lsquo;human
being&rsquo;, primarily signifies. But they can also secondarily
signify other things as well.</p>

<p>
Nominal definitions, Ockham says, are different. There is one and only
one nominal definition for any given connotative term (in mental
language, at any rate). A nominal definition is supposed to unfold
precisely the signification of the connotative term it serves to
define. This can only be done, Ockham thinks, by explicitly
mentioning, in the right order and with the right connections, which
kinds of things are primarily and secondarily signified by the
relevant terms of the definition. The nominal definition of the
connotative term &lsquo;brave&rsquo;, for example, is &ldquo;a living
being endowed with bravery&rdquo;, which reveals that
&lsquo;brave&rsquo; primarily signifies certain living beings and
secondarily signifies&mdash;or connotes&mdash;singular qualities of
 bravery.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Any non-equivalent nominal definition is bound to indicate a
different signification and would, consequently, be unsuitable if the
original one was correct.</p>

<p>
On the first interpretation, several commentators concluded that there
are no <em>simple</em> connotative terms in Ockham&rsquo;s mental
language. They reasoned as follows: A connotative term is synonymous
with its nominal definition, but there is no synonymy in mental
language; mental language, therefore, cannot contain both a simple
connotative term and its complex nominal definition. Which of the two
goes? Since mental language must have the resources for formulating
adequate definitions, the redundant element must be the defined simple
term. And, since <em>every</em> connotative term has a nominal
definition, then it follows that mental language should only contain
absolute terms along with syncategorematic terms. On this
interpretation, if anything can be truly said about the world, it can
be said <em>only</em> using absolute and syncategorematic terms in
mental language. It follows that absolute terms, and only absolute
terms, provide us with a guide to what exists in the ontology, nicely
bringing together the semantic and ontological sides of Ockham&rsquo;s
nominalist program.</p>

<p>
This interpretation led to the conclusion, however, that this
nominalist program was bound to fail. For, not all connotative terms
can be plausibly eliminated from mental language. Relational terms,
for instance, are connotative terms in Ockham&rsquo;s semantics, and
should, therefore, be semantically reducible to combinations of
non-relational terms. But this seems implausible. The second
interpretation showed that Ockham did hold that there are simple
connotative terms in mental language and, in fact, says so
 repeatedly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, Ockham explicitly denies that a complex definition is in
general wholly synonymous with the corresponding defined
 term.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 His point, presumably, is that the definition usually signifies
<em>more</em> things than the defined term. Take &lsquo;brave&rsquo;
again. Its definition, remember, is &ldquo;a living being endowed with
bravery&rdquo;. Now, the first part of this complex expression makes
us think of <em>all</em> living beings, whereas the simple term
&lsquo;brave&rsquo; has only the brave living beings as its primary
significates without signifying in any way non-brave living beings as
well. This shows in effect that simple connotative terms are
not&mdash;at least not always&mdash;shorthand abbreviations for their
nominal definitions. The secondary literature has now gradually
converged on the view that there is no synonymy among <em>simple</em>
terms in mental language, but that there can be some redundancy
between simple terms and complex expressions, (e.g., definitions), or
between various complex expressions.</p>

<p>
What is the purpose of Ockham&rsquo;s nominal definitions, then? They
are not reductionist devices for eliminating certain <em>terms</em>,
but a privileged means for making conspicuous the <em>things</em> that
are the primary and secondary significates of the defined terms. The
main point here is that such definitions, when correctly formulated,
explicitly reveal the ontological commitments associated with the
normal use of the defined terms. The definition of &lsquo;brave&rsquo;
as &ldquo;a living being endowed with bravery&rdquo;, for example,
shows that the correct use of the term &lsquo;brave&rsquo; commits us
only to the existence of singular living beings and singular
qualitative braveries.</p>

<h2 id="Meta">4. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Ockham is most famous for his metaphysical nominalism and ontological
reductionism about categories. Not only does he think that everything
that exists is individual or particular, he wants to reduce his
ontology to a bare minimum of number of kinds by paring down the
fundamental ontological categories to just substance and quality. For
Ockham, everything that exists in the created universe is a singular
substance or a singular quality. In principle, metaphysical nominalism
and categorial ontological reductionism are independent from one
another. One can deny that universal entities exist, but allow
singular entities in more ontological categories than Ockham does.
Conversely, one can reduce the number of ontological categories, and
yet hold that there are universal entities in those remaining
categories. Panaccio (2023) has recently characterized Ockham&rsquo;s
nominalism as the view that for any general, quantitative, and
relational term there is <em>no corresponding, special sort of
 entity</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 On this characterization, Ockham&rsquo;s metaphysical nominalism
includes his ontological reductionism about categories, at least for
the categories of quantity and relation, by emphatically denying the
existence of universal entities, quantitative entities, and relational
entities (outside a small number of theological exceptions).</p>

<h3 id="OckhRazo">4.1 Ockham&rsquo;s Razor</h3>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s metaphysical views are thought to stem from an
underlying concern for ontological parsimony as summed up in the
famous slogan known as &ldquo;Ockham&rsquo;s Razor&rdquo; according to
which one &ldquo;must not multiply entities beyond
 necessity&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 Although the sentiment is certainly Ockham&rsquo;s, this particular
formulation is nowhere to be found in his texts. Moreover, as usually
stated, it is a sentiment that most philosophers, medieval or
otherwise, would accept. Few philosophers endorse an
<em>unnecessarily</em> large ontology. Ockham&rsquo;s Razor is merely
a cautionary methodological principle advising us not to endorse a
metaphysical claim that requires us to posit the existence of more
entities over a competing claim that does not, except under certain
conditions. In the fullest formulation of the Razor that Ockham gives,
those conditions are spelled out in detail. They are: reason (or
reasoning from self-evident premises), experience, and infallible
religious authority (namely, Sacred
 Scripture).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 Unless we can meet one of these conditions for some putative sort of
entity, we ought not endorse a claim that supposes that sort of entity
to exist. If, however, we can meet one of those conditions, then we
have good reason to think that the less parsimonious claim is true
over the more parsimonious claim.</p>

<h3 id="RejeUniv">4.2 The Rejection of Universals</h3>

<p>
Ockham does not argue against the existence of universal entities on
the basis of the Razor. That is, he does not think that we should
refrain from affirming the existence of universal entities just
because there are no good reasons for doing so in the absence of
further evidence. No, he holds that realist theories of universals, at
least the realist theories that were prevalent at the time, are
outright incoherent. They are either self-contradictory or
incompatible with other statements that philosophers hold to be true.
For Ockham, the only universals it makes sense to talk about are
universal concepts, and, derivative from them, universal terms in
spoken and written language. In other words, there is no universal
entity of felinity but only singular cats, which are relevantly and
essentially similar to one another in and of themselves. There is,
certainly, the universal concept of <em>cat</em>. Metaphysically,
universal concepts are singular entities like all others. They are
&ldquo;universal&rdquo; only in the sense of being &ldquo;predicable
of many&rdquo;, as the term &lsquo;cat&rsquo; is truly predicable of
each and every cat.</p>

<p>
With respect to the exact ontological status of such conceptual
entities, however, Ockham changed his view over the course of his
career. To begin with, he adopted what is known as the
<em>fictum</em>-theory, a theory according to which universals have no
&ldquo;real&rdquo; existence at all, not being in any of the
Aristotelian categories that purport to carve up extra-mental reality.
Instead, they are purely &ldquo;intentional objects&rdquo; with a
special mode of intra-mental existence that is only a kind of
&ldquo;thought&rdquo;-reality. Eventually, however, Ockham came to
think this intentional realm of &ldquo;fictive&rdquo; entities was not
needed, and by the time of his <em>Summa of Logic</em> and the
<em>Quodlibets</em> he adopts the so-called
<em>intellectio</em>-theory, according to which a universal concept is
just the act of thinking about several objects at once. Metaphysically
such an act is a singular quality of an individual mind, and is
universal only in the sense of being a mental sign of several things
at once and which is, then, predicable of those things in mental
 propositions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ReduOntoCate">4.3 The Reduction of Ontological Categories</h3>

<p>
When it comes to paring down the number of basic ontological
categories, Ockham is more cautious and frequently appeals to the
Razor. To understand his perspective on the ten Aristotelian
categories, it is important to see that the view he claims to be
targeting posits ten fundamental ontological categories: substance,
quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, place, time, position,
and habit. Ockham, by contrast, thinks that there are only two, namely
substance and quality. So, while he agrees with the tradition that
there are ten semantic categories, viz., ten basic kinds of linguistic
terms (conceptual/spoken/written), there are only two ontological
categories of
 beings.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Ockham focuses considerable energy on two categories in particular,
quantity and relation, while the remaining six categories are
cursorily dealt with. When it comes to the category of relation, he
admits that there are a handful of relational entities we should posit
on theological grounds (viz., the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the
Eucharist), but our natural cognitive powers would see no reason to
posit them. Outside these exceptions, he is adamant that there is no
compelling reason to posit quantitative, relational, etc. entities in
the
 ontology.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 Having argued for the existence of substances and, quite notably, for
qualities (most of them, at any rate), he argues against the view that
quantities (e.g., length, depth), relations (e.g., similarity),
actions (e.g., hammering), positions (e.g., sitting), and so on,
<em>exist as entities in addition to singular substances and singular
qualities</em>. He does so by employing a range of metaphysical,
natural philosophical, and even theological arguments to show the
absurdity of holding that these are entities distinct from substances
or qualities. His arguments appeal to the nature of substances, their
parts, and their accidents, the impossibility of actual infinities,
and God&rsquo;s
 power.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 Concomitantly, he provides alternative explanations of how substances
and their qualities are extended, related, positioned, etc., that do
not necessitate positing anything other than those substances, their
parts, and qualities. For instance, he explains that a material
substance is extended simply by virtue of having &ldquo;parts outside
of parts&rdquo;, i.e., having parts, one after or next to another,
rather than on account of a distinct quantitative entity, an
extension. By application of the Razor, then, we can dispense with the
more ontologically committing view in favor of the more parsimonious
view on which we are not required to posit the existence of all these
additional accidental entities.</p>

<p>
Crucial to Ockham&rsquo;s reduction strategy is the theory of
connotation. The idea here is to &ldquo;paraphrase&rdquo; sentences
containing categorial terms that seemingly refer to real entities
which, in fact, we have no good reason to believe in, and in doing so
discharge any unnecessary and thus unwelcome ontological
 commitments.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
 For example, in <em>Summa of Logic,</em> II, 11, among other places,
Ockham argues that we can account for the truth of &ldquo;Socrates is
similar to Plato&rdquo; without having to appeal to a relational
entity called &ldquo;similarity&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For example, for the truth of &lsquo;Socrates is similar to
Plato&rsquo;, it is required that Socrates have some quality and that
Plato have a quality of the same species. Thus, from the very fact
that Socrates is white and Plato is white, Socrates is similar to
Plato and conversely. Likewise, if both are black, or hot, [then] they
are similar <em>without anything else added.</em> (<em>SL</em> II, 11,
<em>OPh</em> I, p. 281. Translation by Spade; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ockham employs the distinction between absolute and connotative terms
as explained above
 (<a href="#MentLangConnDefi">&sect;3.3</a>)
 in full force in his discussion of the categories. Because only
substances and qualities exist, only substantial and qualitative terms
are
 absolute.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 All other categorial terms are connotative and signify those
substances and qualities in different ways. And as connotative terms,
they have nominal definitions that make conspicuous their primary and
secondary significates. For example, the nominal definition of the
relational term &lsquo;mother&rsquo; might be something like
&ldquo;female animals that produce offspring&rdquo;. The first term of
the definition signifies female animals and the second term signifies
her offspring. The term &lsquo;mother&rsquo;, therefore, primarily
signifies female animals and secondarily signifies their offspring.
Yet, both female animals and their offspring are just substances. With
the appropriate application of connotation theory, then, we can
paraphrase sentences using categorial terms, clarifying that they only
require the existence of substances and qualities.</p>

<p>
It is important to stress that Ockham is not denying that substances
and their qualities are quantified, related, positioned, and so on.
The sentences &ldquo;A table is two meters long&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Socrates and Plato are similar&rdquo; are objectively true and
verifiable of things in the world. Ockham is denying, rather, that
quantitative, relational, and position terms, e.g., &lsquo;two meters
long&rsquo; and &lsquo;similar&rsquo; pick out &ldquo;little&rdquo;
really distinct things that exist in the ontology addition to the
table and its extended parts, or to Socrates, Plato, and their
qualities of whiteness.</p>

<h3 id="MateSubsArti">4.4 Material Substances and Artifacts</h3>

<p>
Because Ockham&rsquo;s preference for ontological parsimony is so
ubiquitous, it can seem that his metaphysics is only negative. All he
seems to do is argue <em>against</em> metaphysical claims that are
more ontologically committing than those that are less so. While not
denying this basic philosophical orientation, it should not detract
from the recognition that there tends to be a positive flip side to
all this. We have already seen that he does give an account of how
material substances are extended. His account of the metaphysical
structure of material substances, on the one hand, and of artifacts on
the other, are also instructive in this regard. In both cases, it is
true that he denies that material substances and artifacts are wholes
existing over and above their parts. In both cases, however, he
provides an explanation of what sort of wholes they are on the basis
of a consideration of their parts and how their parts are unified.
Arguing against Scotus, he denies the existence of an additional
&ldquo;form of the whole&rdquo; that unifies the substantial forms and
chunks of matter so as to constitute a single material substance. But
this does not mean that he has no positive account of the metaphysics
of material substances. On the contrary, he holds that a human being,
for example, is identical to its conjoined essential parts, which are
its rational and sensory souls as well as a corporeal form and its
matter. In the natural order and in the absence of divine
intervention, the essential parts of a material substance under
particular conditions have an intrinsic disposition to unite in such a
way that they form that one single material substance. Similarly, he
denies the existence of an additional accidental form that would unify
the parts of an artifact. Rather, an artifact like a house, for
instance, is identical to a collection of natural material substances,
e.g., stones, lengths of wood, etc., that have been moved locally into
sufficient proximity to one
 another.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="NatuPhil">5. Natural Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s &ldquo;physics&rdquo; or natural philosophy is of a
broadly Aristotelian sort, although he interprets Aristotle in his own
fashion. Ockham wrote a great deal in this area, although many of
those topics we would now classify as metaphysical.</p>

<p>
As a nominalist about universals, Ockham had to deal with the
Aristotelian claim in the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> that science
pertains to certain propositions about that which is universal and
necessary. He discusses this issue in the Prologue to his
<em>Exposition of the
 Physics</em>,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 and there agrees with Aristotle. But he interprets Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>dictum</em> as saying that knowledge bears upon certain
propositions with general (i.e., universal) terms in them. It is only
in this sense that science deals with the universal. This of course
does not mean that for Ockham our scientific knowledge can never move
beyond the level of language to actual things. He distinguishes
various senses of &lsquo;to know&rsquo; (<em>scire</em>, from which we
get &ldquo;<em>scientia</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;science&rdquo;):</p>

<ul>

<li>In one sense, &ldquo;to know&rdquo; is to know a proposition, or a
term in that proposition. It is in this sense that the object of a
science is universal, and this is what Aristotle had in mind.</li>

<li>In another sense, we can be said &ldquo;to know&rdquo; what the
proposition is about, what its terms supposit for. What we know in
this sense is always metaphysically individual, since for Ockham there
is nothing else. This is not the sense in which Aristotle was
speaking.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As described earlier
 (<a href="#ReduOntoCate">&sect;4.3</a>),
 Ockham holds that we do not need to allow special entities in all ten
of Aristotle&rsquo;s categories. In particular, we do not need them in
the category of quantity. For Ockham, there is no need for real
mathematical entities such as numbers, points, lines, and surfaces as
distinct from singular substances and qualities. Apparent talk about
such things can invariably be parsed away via the theory of
connotation in favor of talk about substances and qualities. This
Ockhamist move is illustrative of, and was influential on, an
important development in late medieval physics, namely the application
of mathematics to non-mathematical things, culminating in
Galileo&rsquo;s famous statement that the &ldquo;book of nature&rdquo;
is written in the &ldquo;language of mathematics&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Such an application of mathematics violates a traditional Aristotelian
prohibition against <em>metabasis eis allo genos,</em> grounded on
quite reasonable considerations. The basic idea is that things cannot
be legitimately compared in any respect in which they differ in
species. Thus, it makes little sense to ask whether the
soprano&rsquo;s high C is higher or lower than Mount
Everest&mdash;much less to ask (quantitatively) <em>how much</em>
higher or lower it is. But for Aristotle, straight lines and curved
lines belong to different species of lines. Hence, they cannot be
meaningfully compared or measured against one another. The same holds
for rectilinear motion and circular motion.</p>

<p>
Although the basic idea is reasonable enough, Ockham recognized that
there are problems. The length of a coiled rope, for example, can
straightforwardly be compared to the length of an uncoiled rope, and
the one can meaningfully be said to be longer or shorter than, or
equal in length to, the other. For that matter, a <em>single</em> rope
surely stays the same length, whether it is coiled or extended
full-length. Ockham&rsquo;s solution to these problems is to note
that, on his ontology, straight lines and curved lines are not
<em>really</em> different species of lines&mdash;because lines are not
extra things in the first place. Talk about lines is simply a
&ldquo;manner of speaking&rdquo; about substances and qualities
(taking into account only one of their dimensions, say, their length,
while disregarding others, namely, their width and depth).</p>

<p>
Thus, to compare a &ldquo;curved&rdquo; (coiled) rope with a
&ldquo;straight&rdquo; (uncoiled) one is not really to talk about the
lengths of lines in two different species; it is to talk about two
<em>ropes</em>. To describe the one as curved (coiled) and the other
as straight (uncoiled) is not to appeal to specifically different
kinds of entities&mdash;curvature and straightness&mdash;but merely to
describe the ropes in ways that can be expounded according to two
different patterns. Since such talk does not have ontological
implications that would require specifically different kinds of
entities, the Aristotelian prohibition of <em>metabasis</em> does not
apply.</p>

<p>
Once one realizes that we can appeal to connotation theory, and more
generally the theory of exposition, without invoking new entities, the
door is opened to applying mathematical analyses (all of which are
exponible, for Ockham) to all kinds of things, and in particular to
physical nature.</p>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s contributions were by no means the only factor in the
increasing mathematization of science in the fourteenth century. But
they were important
 ones.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="TheoKnow">6. Theory of Knowledge</h2>

<p>
Like most medieval accounts of knowledge, Ockham&rsquo;s is not much
concerned with answering skeptical doubts. He takes it for granted
that humans not only can but frequently do know truths about the
world, and focuses his attention instead on the mechanisms by which
this knowledge comes about.</p>

<h3 id="RejeSpec">6.1 The Rejection of Species</h3>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s theory of knowledge, like his natural philosophy, is
broadly Aristotelian, although&mdash;again, like his natural
philosophy&mdash;it is Aristotelian in its own way. For most
Aristotelians of the day, knowledge involved the transmission of a
 &ldquo;<em>species</em>&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup>
 between the object and the mind. At the sensory level, the sensory
species may be compared to the more recent notion of a sense
impression. More generally, we can think of it as the structure or
configuration of the object that can be &ldquo;encoded&rdquo; in
different ways and found isomorphically in a variety of contexts. One
recent author, describing the theory as it occurs in Aquinas, puts it
like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Consider, for example, blueprints. In a blueprint of a library, the
configuration of the library itself, that is, the very configuration
that will be in the finished library, is captured on paper but in such
a way that it does not make the paper itself into a library. Rather,
the configuration is imposed on the paper in a different sort of way
from the way it is imposed on the materials of the library. What
Aquinas thinks of as transferring and preserving a configuration we
tend to consider as a way of encoding information. (Stump 1999:
170)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The configuration of features found in the external object is also
found in encoded form as a species in the organ that senses the
object. (Depending on the sense modality, it may also be found in an
intervening medium. For example, with vision and hearing, the species
is transmitted through the air to the sense organ.) At the
intellectual level, the so-called &ldquo;agent intellect&rdquo; goes
to work on this species, extracting out of it an intelligible species
from which it somehow produces the universal concept that is the raw
material of intellectual
 cognition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Ockham rejected this entire theory of species. For him, both sensory
and intellectual species are unnecessary for a successful theory of
cognition, and he dispenses with them by appealing to the Razor.
Moreover, he argues, species theory is not supported by experience.
Introspection reveals no such species in our cognitive
 processes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 His rejection of the species theory of cognition, which had been
foreshadowed by several previous authors (such as Henry of Ghent in
the thirteenth century), was an important development in late medieval
epistemology (For a discussion, see Tachau 1988).</p>

<h3 id="IntuAbstCogn">6.2 Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition</h3>

<p>
One of the more intriguing features of late medieval epistemology in
general, and of Ockham&rsquo;s view in particular, is the development
of a theory known as &ldquo;intuitive and abstractive
cognition&rdquo;. The theory is found in authors as diverse as Duns
Scotus, Peter Auriol, Walter Chatton, and Ockham. But, their theories
of intuitive and abstractive cognition are so different that it is
hard to see any one thing they are all supposed to be theories of.
Nevertheless, at a first approximation, intuitive cognition can be
thought of as perception, whereas abstractive cognition is closer to
imagination, remembering, and generalizing or conceptual thought. The
fit is not exact, however, since authors who had a theory of intuitive
and abstractive cognition usually also allowed the distinction at the
<em>intellectual</em> level as well. In Ockham&rsquo;s case, his
theory of intuitive cognition helps explain that we can cognize an
individual as an individual on both the sensory and the intellectual
level. Many medieval philosophers tended to deny that we can have
direct intellectual cognition of an individual, believing that sensory
cognition was of an individual while intellectual cognition was of a
universal.</p>

<p>
It is important to note, however, that abstractive cognition does not
necessarily have to do with abstraction in the sense of producing
universal concepts from cognitive encounters with individuals. What
abstractive cognition abstracts from is the question of the
<em>existence or non-existence</em> of the object. By contrast,
intuitive cognition is very much tied up with the existence or
non-existence of the object. Here is how Ockham distinguishes
them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For intuitive cognition of a thing is a cognition such that by virtue
of it, it can be known whether the thing exists or not, in such a way
that if the thing does exist, the intellect at once judges it to exist
and evidently knows it to exist &hellip; Likewise, intuitive cognition
is such that when some things are known, one of which inheres in the
other or the one is distant in place from the other or is related in
another way to the other, it is at once known by virtue of the
incomplex cognitions of those things whether the thing inheres or does
not inhere, whether it is distant or not distant, and so on for other
contingent truths &hellip;</p>

<p>
Abstractive cognition, however, is that by virtue of which it cannot
be evidently known of the thing whether it exists or does not exist.
And in this way abstractive cognition, as opposed to intuitive
cognition, &lsquo;abstracts&rsquo; from existence and non-existence,
because by it neither can it be evidently known of an existing thing
that it exists, nor of a non-existent one that it does not exist.
(<em>Sent.</em> I, Prologue, q. 1, <em>OTh</em> I, pp. 31&ndash;2.
Translation by Spade)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s main point here is that an intuitive cognition
<em>naturally</em> causes in the mind a number of true
<em>contingent</em> judgments about the external thing(s) that caused
this intuitive cognition. For example, that this thing exists, that it
is white, that is at such-and-such a distance from another thing, and
so on. This does not prevent God from deceiving any particular
creature if He wants to, even when an intuitive cognition is present,
but in such a case God would have to neutralize the natural causal
effect of this intuitive cognition (this is something He can always
do, according to Ockham) and directly cause instead a false judgment.
Intuitive cognitions, on the other hand, can sometimes induce false
beliefs, too, if the circumstances are abnormal (in cases of
perceptual illusions in particular), but even then, they would still
cause some true contingent judgments. The latter at any rate is their
distinctive feature. Abstractive cognitions, by contrast, are not such
as to naturally cause true judgments about contingent
 matters.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="Ethi">7. Ethics</h2>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s ethics combines a number of
 themes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup>
 Scholars continue to debate how to best characterize his ethics. It
is a will-based ethics in which intentions, that is, free and
voluntary acts of willing, count for everything. External behavior or
actions are morally neutral in themselves. They derive their moral
worth from the intentions that underlie them. So, two people can
perform the same act&mdash;say walking to church, to use a common
medieval example&mdash;but the person who walks to church because she
wants to worship God is morally praiseworthy while the person who
walks to church because he wants to gossip with his neighbors is
not.</p>

<p>
There is also a strong dose of divine command theory in Ockham&rsquo;s
ethics. Certain things, namely certain intentions, become morally
obligatory, permitted, or forbidden simply because God decrees so.
Thus, in Exodus, the Israelites&rsquo; &ldquo;spoiling the
Egyptians&rdquo; (or rather their intention to do so, which they
carried out) was not a matter of theft or plunder, but was morally
permissible and indeed obligatory&mdash;because God had commanded
it.</p>

<p>
And yet, despite the divine command theme in Ockham&rsquo;s ethics, it
is also clear that he wanted morality to be a matter of reason as
well. He concedes that we can have a &ldquo;science of morals&rdquo;
by virtue of which, through experience and the exercise of natural
reason, we can come to some knowledge of moral principles outside
positive human and divine law (<em>Quodl</em>. II, q. 14, <em>OTh</em>
IX, pp. 176&ndash;8). There is even a sense in which one can find a
kind of natural law theory in Ockham&rsquo;s ethics. One way in which
God conveys his divine commands to us is by giving us the natures we
 have.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 Unlike Augustine, Ockham accepted the possibility of the
&ldquo;virtuous pagan&rdquo;. Moral virtue, for Ockham, does not
depend on having access to revelation.</p>

<h3 id="Virt">7.1 The Virtues</h3>

<p>
But while moral virtue is possible even for the pagan, moral virtue is
not by itself enough for salvation. Salvation requires not just moral
virtue (the opposite of which is moral vice) but merit (the opposite
of which is sin), and merit requires grace, a free gift from God. In
short, there is no necessary connection between virtue&mdash;moral
goodness&mdash;and salvation. Ockham repeatedly emphasizes that
&ldquo;God is a debtor to no one&rdquo;, meaning that God does not owe
us anything, no matter what we do.</p>

<p>
For Ockham, acts of willing are morally virtuous either extrinsically,
i.e., derivatively by their conformity to some more fundamental act of
willing, or intrinsically. On pain of infinite regress, therefore,
extrinsically virtuous acts of willing must ultimately lead back to an
intrinsically virtuous act of willing. That intrinsically virtuous act
of willing, for Ockham, is an act of &ldquo;loving God above all else
and for his own sake&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In his early work, <em>On the Connection of the Virtues</em>, Ockham
distinguishes five stages of moral virtue, which have been the topic
of considerable speculation in the secondary
 literature:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul>

<li>The first and lowest stage is found when someone wills to act in
accordance with &ldquo;right reason&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., because it is
&ldquo;the right thing to do&rdquo;.</li>

<li>The second stage adds moral &ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; to the
picture. The agent is willing to act in accordance with right reason
even in the face of contrary considerations, and even&mdash;if
necessary&mdash;on pain of death.</li>

<li>The third stage adds a certain exclusivity to the motivation; one
wills to act in this way <em>only</em> because right reason requires
it. It is not enough to will to act in accordance with right reason,
even heroically, if one does so on the basis of extraneous, non-moral
motives.</li>

<li>At the fourth stage of moral virtue, one wills to act in this way
&ldquo;precisely for the love of God&rdquo;. This stage &ldquo;alone
is the true and perfect moral virtue of which the Saints
speak&rdquo;.</li>

<li>The fifth and final stage can be built immediately on either the
third or the fourth stage. Thus, one can have the fifth without the
fourth stage. The fifth stage adds an element of extraordinary moral
heroism that goes beyond even the &ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; of stage
two.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="MoraPsyc">7.2 Moral Psychology</h3>

<p>
At the beginning of his <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, Aristotle
remarked that &ldquo;the good is that at which all things aim&rdquo;.
Each thing, therefore, aims at the good, according to the demands of
its nature. In the Middle Ages, &ldquo;Aristotelians&rdquo; like
Thomas Aquinas held that the good for human beings in particular is
happiness, the enjoyment of the direct vision of God in the next life.
And, whether they realize it or not, that is what all human beings are
ultimately aiming at in their actions. For someone like Aquinas,
therefore, the human will is free only in a certain restricted sense.
We are <em>not</em> free to choose for or against our final end; that
is built into us by nature. But we are free to choose various
<em>mean</em>s to that end. All our choices, therefore, are made under
the aspect of leading to that final goal. To be sure, sometimes we
make the wrong choices, but when that occurs it is because of
ignorance, distraction, self-deception, etc. In an important sense,
then, someone like Aquinas accepts a version of the so-called Socratic
Paradox: No one knowingly and deliberately does
 evil.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s view is quite different. Although he is very suspicious
of the notion of final causality (teleology) in general, he thinks it
is quite appropriate for intelligent, voluntary agents such as human
beings. Thus, the charge that Ockham severs ethics from metaphysics by
denying teleology seems
 wrong.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup>
 Nevertheless, while Ockham grants that human beings have a natural
orientation, a tendency toward their own ultimate good, he does not
think this restricts their choices.</p>

<p>
For Ockham, as for Aristotle and Aquinas, I can choose the means to
achieve my ultimate good. But in addition, unlike Aristotle and
Aquinas, for Ockham I can choose whether to will that ultimate
 good.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>
 The natural orientation and tendency toward that good is built in; I
cannot do anything about that. But I can choose whether or not to act
to achieve that good. I might choose, for example, to do nothing at
all, and I might choose this knowing full well what I am doing. But
even more: I can choose to act knowingly directly <em>against</em> my
ultimate good, to thwart
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>
 I can choose evil <em>as</em> evil. Hence, Ockham can be thought to
hold a radical position on the freedom of the will: the human will is
free to choose otherwise than it does, and our choices, while they are
informed by our intellect, are not determined by it.</p>

<p>
For Ockham, this is required if I am going to be morally responsible
for my
 actions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 If I could not help but will to act to achieve my ultimate good, then
it would not be morally praiseworthy of me to do so; moral &ldquo;sins
of omission&rdquo; would be impossible (although of course I could be
mistaken in the means I adopt). By the same token, moral &ldquo;sins
of commission&rdquo; would be impossible if I could not knowingly act
against my ultimate good. But for Ockham these conclusions are not
just required by theory; they are confirmed by experience.</p>

<h2 id="PoliPhil">8. Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s political writings began with a discussion of the issue
of poverty and property. His views were important for the development
of the notion of natural rights and property rights that emerged out
of his engagement with the Franciscan conflict with Pope John XXII.
This engagement led him, moreover, to inquire into the nature of
heresy and the institutional aspect of the Church, particularly the
papacy, since one of his central and overriding concerns was whether a
pope could become a heretic. Given the authority and responsibility of
the pope as the head of (Roman Catholic) Christendom, this in turn led
to a generalized consideration of the relations between spiritual and
temporal powers (somewhat anachronistically we can call these
&ldquo;church and state&rdquo;). Concerned to protect temporal power
from papal overreach, he was part of a tradition of medieval authors
including his near contemporary John of Paris who advocated that these
powers should operate within their own sphere, neither one being
subordinate to the other and both deriving their legitimacy and
authority from independent sources.</p>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s political thought is extensive, rich, and less
systematic than his academic philosophy. Certain preoccupations,
however, recur such as an interest in defending individual human
liberty, the contingency, variability, and fallibility of human
institutions, and the threat of a heretical
 pope.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 Three main themes are covered
 here.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="FranPovePropRighCrisAvig">8.1 Franciscan Poverty, Property Rights, and the Crisis in Avignon</h3>

<p id="IdeaPove">
As sketched above
 (<a href="#Avig1324">&sect;1.2</a>),
 while in Avignon waiting for the papal commission to decide on the
orthodoxy of some of his theological views, Ockham was tasked by
Michael of Cesena to look into papal documentation on the Franciscan
Order and the question of Apostolic poverty. Some context is necessary
to see what the issue was. Foundational to the identity of the
Franciscan Order was the original ideal of austere poverty practiced
and advocated by St. Francis himself (c. 1181&ndash;1226). The ideal
of poverty had been, and still is, a common one in religious
communities, both monastic and mendicant (mendicant communities being
orders like the Franciscan and Dominican Orders, among others, that
rose to prominence in the thirteenth century). Typically, the idea is
that an individual member of the community in question owns no
property at all. If a member buys a car, for instance, it is not
strictly his car, even though he may have exclusive use of it, and it
was not bought with his money; he doesn&rsquo;t have any money of his
own. Rather, it belongs to the community.</p>

<p>
The Franciscan ideal of poverty went further. Not only did the
individual friar have no property of his own, <em>neither did the
Order</em>. In other words, the Franciscan Order rejected both
individual and collective property ownership. They were indeed
supposed to be truly &ldquo;mendicant&rdquo;, to live by begging and
by relying for their basic needs on the generosity of others. Anything
donated to the Order, such as a house or a piece of land, remained the
property of the original owner strictly speaking, who, however, only
granted permission for its &ldquo;simple&rdquo; or &ldquo;bare&rdquo;
use to the Franciscan Order. If that would not work&mdash;as, for
example, in the case of a bequest in a will&mdash;the ownership would
go to the Papacy after the original owner had died.</p>

<p>
The Franciscan Order thought their ideal of poverty was exhibited by
the life of Jesus and the Apostles, who&mdash;they said&mdash;had
given up all property individually and collectively. St. Francis
regarded this as the clear implication of several Scriptural passages:
e.g., Matthew 6:24&ndash;34, 8:20, 19:21, and strove to adopt this
ideal for the Order. In 1279, Pope Nicholas III officially approved of
this Franciscan way of life. Yet, tensions within the Franciscan Order
between moderates (the &ldquo;Conventuals&rdquo;) and radicals (the
&ldquo;Spirituals&rdquo;) about how to manage the Order in practice
given this ideal grew over the course of the end of the thirteenth
century and into the fourteenth century. The mainstream Franciscan
position, adopted by the Conventuals and included Ockham, Michael of
Cesena, and others, only expected the Franciscan Order to maintain
this ideal. They did not think that there was something morally wrong
about property ownership <em>per se</em>. Poverty is not a duty but a
&ldquo;counsel of perfection&rdquo;, so it is acceptable to own
property, but it is better&mdash;more perfect&mdash;not to. They were
not, then, advocating the total abolition of property, and they did
not think that the Papacy should not own property. On the contrary, in
certain cases, the Papacy owned the goods that members of the
Franciscan Order could use.</p>

<p>
Pope John XXII decided, however, to reopen the discussion. He issued a
series of papal bulls (among which, <em>Ad conditorem</em> in 1322,
<em>Quum inter nonnullos</em> in 1323, and <em>Quia vir reprobus</em>
in 1329) in which he rejected the Franciscan distinction between use
and ownership. He also declared it heretical to hold that Christ and
the Apostles did not own property. Drawing on Roman law, John argued
that use and ownership could not be separated. The case of consumable
goods was especially important to drive this point home: there is no
meaningful distinction between use and ownership if, by virtue of
using some good, I consume it in such a way that I integrally damage
or destroy it, e.g., eating food or wearing out a friar&rsquo;s habit.
For, even if its owner has granted me the use of the good in question,
once I have consumed it, the good can never be returned to its owner.
For all intents and purposes, it is mine. For John, then, it is
impossible to fully live the life of absolute poverty for an
individual person, much less for a permanent institution like the
Franciscan Order.</p>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s first political work, the <em>Work of Ninety Days</em>,
is a scathing line-by-line dissection of John&rsquo;s <em>Quia vir
reprobus</em>, in which Ockham argues on behalf of the
&ldquo;attackers&rdquo; (the Franciscans around Michael of Cesena)
against &ldquo;the attacked&rdquo; (John). The work is an exhaustive
analysis of property and property rights, covering in minute detail
different kinds of use and ownership that individuals and collectives
can have. Throughout, Ockham consistently maintains the Franciscan
distinction between use and ownership, even for consumables, and makes
a number of significant elaborations concerning rights and property
along the
 way.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 The first of these that bears drawing attention to is a distinction
between natural rights, which are independent from any particular
legal system, and rights &ldquo;of the forum&rdquo;, which are set up
by human positive
 law.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 The Franciscan Order only has a natural right of using those goods
that are necessary to sustain basic life. Such rights cannot be
renounced, since to do so would lead to one&rsquo;s own harm or death.
The Franciscan Order can, however, renounce rights pertaining to
ownership, which is what it does by voluntarily opting out, as it
were, from the positive legal framework of property rights. A
consequence of this is that the Order does not have the right to go to
court to settle any property claim. The broader significance of this
distinction is the suggestion that there are a certain number of
natural, non-renounceable, and inalienable rights that all human
beings have.</p>

<p>
A second notable elaboration is the origin of property and
Ockham&rsquo;s considered opinion, reiterated in later political works
as well, that all property is in fact <em>private</em> and established
through human agreement and human positive law. John had justified his
view on the non-separability of use and ownership by arguing that the
institution of property, and, therefore, property rights, began in the
Garden of Eden. According to John, God gave Adam and Eve ownership
over the goods they consumed before the Fall, so that property rights
were established by divine positive law.</p>

<p id="PropRigh">
Ockham disagreed. He argued that there was no property in the Garden
of Eden, because property implies <em>exclusive</em> lordship over
goods. Adam and Eve had no such lordship before the Fall. They simply
used&mdash;and had the natural right of using&mdash;whatever they
needed in the Garden. Property was introduced after the Fall by human
beings who, seeking to mitigate the violence and greed caused by the
Fall, recognized the necessity of establishing legal arrangements for
the protection, regulation, and management of property in society.
Ockham is quite clear that <em>we</em> established property but he
acknowledges that God gives us the power to do so. Property ownership
is, therefore, permissible post-Fall. We confer certain legal rights
(managing, disposing, transferring, defending claims to, etc.) over
certain things (property) to certain people (owners) to the exclusion
of anyone else. Owners can, of course, give permission to others to
use the goods they own, but that permission does not amount to giving
other people a legal right they could appeal to in a court of law.
This is the way the Franciscan Order and its members operate according
to Ockham. Their benefactors do not give Franciscans any legal rights
over the things donated to the Franciscans, but only permission for
the simple use of those things, which owners can revoke at any time
and for which no Franciscan could lay claim in a court of law.</p>

<h3 id="HereDial">8.2 Heresy and the <em>Dialogue</em></h3>

<p>
John XXII&rsquo;s view that Jesus and the Apostles did not disavow
property ownership is expressed in a number of claims that Ockham
concluded were</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
heretical, erroneous, silly, ridiculous, fantastic, insane, and
defamatory, contrary and likewise plainly adverse to orthodox faith.
(<em>Epistola ad Fratres Minores</em>, <em>OPol</em> III, p. 6.
Translation by Kilcullen in <em>Letter to the Friars Minor</em>, p.
3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The conviction that John XXII was a heretic and a profound worry about
the state of the Church, which he tended to conceive as the totality
of believing Christians, led Ockham to write his political masterwork,
the <em>Dialogue</em>, to which it is impossible to do justice here. A
vast work divided into three parts and left unfinished, the
<em>Dialogue</em> is an exchange between a master and a student that
was anonymously written&mdash;Ockham is not identified as its
author&mdash;and, more intriguingly, Ockham never specifies what his
own opinion is. The student initiates and guides the dialogue by
asking the master questions to which the master replies by providing
arguments for and against answers to those questions. Ockham is
offering, in effect, a massive and often labyrinthine array of
arguments on behalf of conflicting claims on many issues. The
arguments put forth are from authority, typically based on Scripture,
the canon law tradition, and the writings of the Church Fathers, but
also include arguments &ldquo;from reason&rdquo;. Determining what
Ockham thinks on any particular issue is not easy, but one way to
decide which opinion is likely his is by comparing arguments and
positions from the <em>Dialogue</em> with those we find in his
non-anonymous works, like the <em>Short Discourse</em>.</p>

<p>
Part I of the <em>Dialogue</em> is about heresy and heretics. Ockham
covers a huge range of topics starting with which group of experts,
theologians or canon lawyers, has the authority to decide on matters
relating to heresy (Book 1). He then turns to <em>what</em> is heresy,
which necessitates a discussion of its converse, i.e., orthodox
Catholic truth and its sources (Book 2), and <em>who</em> can be
considered a heretic (Book 3). At this point, it becomes evident that
heresy is not simply some erroneous belief contrary to orthodox faith.
Rather, Ockham introduces the notion that heresy involves
<em>stubborn</em> (&ldquo;pertinacious&rdquo;) erroneous belief
contrary to orthodox faith. This focuses attention on the conditions
under which a person chooses to believe some proposition <em>p</em>
that conflicts with orthodox Catholic truth as contained in, notably,
Scripture. Someone who persists in choosing to believe <em>p</em> even
after it has been adequately explained to her that <em>p</em>
conflicts with Scripture, indicates that she is pertinacious and is,
therefore, condemnable as a heretic (Book 4). This explanatory
process, an educational venture of sorts, is called &ldquo;legitimate
correction&rdquo;, and can be licitly pursued by any unerring and
faithful Christian or group of Christians within the Church.
Institutional power and rank are less decisive for establishing
one&rsquo;s authority to detect and correct heresy than knowledge of
orthodox Catholic faith.</p>

<p>
The inclusion of pertinacity as a necessary criterion for being a
heretic, as well as the introduction of legitimate correction as the
first and primary corrective for suspected heresy, indicates that
Ockham is open to a limited degree of what we would now call freedom
of thought and expression (see Kilcullen 1999 for this reading).
Limited, to be sure, to well-meaning and knowledge-seeking Christians
who are discussing their faith. As long as one is ready to be
corrected, and avoids being pertinacious, there is some latitude for
debate especially amongst experts such as theologians.</p>

<p>
From here, Ockham launches a comprehensive discussion of whether
different members of the Church can become heretics, treating
sequentially the pope, cardinals, the Roman Church, the general
council, the clergy, and eventually, the whole totality of Christian
believers (Book 5). Scholarly consensus is that Ockham holds the view
that no one member or group of members of the Church is infallible,
including the pope. Consequently, <em>any</em> such member or group of
members can become heretics. Accepting Christ&rsquo;s promise that
&ldquo;I am with you always, even unto the end of the world&rdquo;
(Matthew 28:20), Ockham holds, by contrast, that the <em>whole</em>
Church can never err. At any given moment until the Last Judgment,
there will be at least one unerring and non-heretical believing
Christian who will preserve the Christian faith and make good on
Christ&rsquo;s promise. Part I is completed with a discussion on the
punishment of heretics, especially of a heretic pope (Book 6) and how
to deal with their supporters (Book 7). Part I of the
<em>Dialogue</em> presents, in sum, an immense study of religious
belief, authority, and power in society as well as the role and
responsibility of individual believing Christians in preserving their
faith against any threat to that faith, even when that threat
originates in the very highest office of the institution of the
Church.</p>

<h3 id="SpirTempPowe">8.3 Spiritual and Temporal Power</h3>

<p>
A heretical pope poses an existential threat to the Christian
community of such proportions that if no member or group of members of
the Church is able or willing to depose him, then the temporal power,
the head of which is a monarch or an emperor, may intervene. The pope
is the head of the spiritual power on earth, but as we have seen this
does not render him infallible or immune from censure and punishment.
Like his more radical political contemporary and fellow exile at
Ludwig of Bavaria&rsquo;s court, Marsilius of Padua, Ockham sees papal
overreach as the source of major social, political, and religious
unrest. In particular, Ockham targets claims to an absolutist
conception of papal &ldquo;fullness of power&rdquo;, a doctrine
according to which the pope can do whatever he wants as long as this
does not contravene divine and natural law (<em>Breviloquium</em> II,
c. 1, <em>OPol</em> IV, 110&ndash;11, and following chapters). One of
Ockham&rsquo;s arguments against the doctrine is that it would follow
that all Christians would be the pope&rsquo;s slaves. The preservation
of human liberty, therefore, is a primary consideration for rejecting
the doctrine of papal fullness of power.</p>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s discussion of papal power ultimately forms part of a
larger set of views on the origin and nature of spiritual and temporal
power, as well as the relations that ought to obtain between them,
which he explores in a number of political writings including Part III
of the <em>Dialogue</em> as well as the <em>Short Discourse</em> and
<em>Eight Questions on the Power of the Pope</em>. In effect, Ockham
pursues a dualist path: the two powers are distinct and independent
from one another in their separate spheres, both with respect to their
origin and their nature, i.e., their governing structures,
jurisdictional limits, and responsibilities (to Christians in the case
of the spiritual power, to peoples and citizens in the case of
temporal power). The origin question is important: Ockham wants to
show that temporal power is not subservient to spiritual power in
temporal matters, and does not owe its legitimacy to the papacy
especially. As with the institution of property, Ockham proposes that
after the Fall God permits human beings to organize into political
communities, and that we do in fact choose to do so
(<em>Breviloquium</em> III, c. 7 and 8, <em>OPol</em> IV,
180&ndash;1). In this way, he is able to argue that non-believing
political communities like the pre-Christian Roman Empire are as
legitimate as Christian political communities, and neither derive
their legitimacy and authority from the pope.</p>

<p>
The jurisdiction that temporal rulers have is remarkably restrained.
Ockham suggests that their central and immediate purpose is the
preservation of law and order (see, e.g., <em>Octo quaestiones de
potestate papae</em> 13, c. 8, <em>OPol</em> 1, 112&ndash;13). By
maintaining law and order, temporal rulers are able to keep sufficient
peace within the community so that its members are free to conduct
their own legally permitted activities and pursuits. The jurisdiction
that spiritual leaders have is more extensive, since they are in
charge of the spiritual well-being of all Christians in this life and
the next. Under normal circumstances, Ockham argues that the two
powers are expected to refrain from interfering with one another. They
each go about exercising their authority and jurisdiction in their
respective spheres, the one regarding temporal matters and the other
regarding spiritual matters. However, under very exigent and
exceptional circumstances, one power can intervene in the other.
Ockham formulates this as the distinction between the
&ldquo;regular&rdquo; and &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; exercise of power.
An example is, of course, a pope who becomes a heretic and thereby
endangers the spiritual life of the Christian community. If no one
within the Church can or will depose him, then the temporal ruler can.
The converse holds as well.</p>
