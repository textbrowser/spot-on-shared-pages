<h1>Daoism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Apr 19, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Chinese Daoism is a Chinese philosophy of natural practice structured
around a normative focus on <em>d&agrave;o</em> (&#36947; path, way).
This naturalist philosophical project treated <em>d&agrave;o</em> as a
structure of natural possibility for living beings. Unlike similar
Western naturalisms, e.g., pragmatism, Daoism&rsquo;s foil was
contemporary: the Confucian-Mohist (<em>Ru-Mo</em>) dialectic about
<em>human</em> (&#20154; <em>r&eacute;n</em> human, social)
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. Daoism&rsquo;s critique of <em>Ru-Mo</em> debate
concerns the role of <em>natural</em> (&#22825; <em>ti&#257;n</em>
sky-nature) <em>d&agrave;o</em> vs <em>human d&agrave;o</em> (socially
constructed guidance).</p>

<p>
Daoism&rsquo;s founding
 personages<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 (<a href="../laozi/">Laozi</a> and
 <a href="../zhuangzi/">Zhuangzi</a>)
 did not coin their &ldquo;-ism.&rdquo; The two Classical texts,
credited to their titled <em>masters</em> (&#23376; <em>z&#464;</em>
son), emerged during the Classical period (5<sup>th</sup> to
3<sup>rd</sup> C. <small>BC</small>). Each reflected skeptically on
the Confucian-Mohist dispute about the correct socio-political
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. Historians first coined the collective category
&ldquo;Daoist&rdquo; (&#36947;&#23478; <em>d&agrave;oji&#257;</em>
school of <em>d&agrave;o</em>) during the Han (2<sup>nd</sup> C
<small>BC</small> to 2<sup>nd</sup> C), There are inconclusive hints
of their having shared a philosophical project in the two
writings.</p>

<p>
The philosophical project was to conceive of norms (permissibility) as
metaphorical <em>path</em>-like structures (<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) of
natural possibility. Its signal axiom was that the structure changed
constantly as new things (and <em>d&agrave;o</em>s) emerged. All such
natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are guides for the <em>behavior</em>
(&#34892; <em>x&iacute;ng</em> walking)
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 of <em>things</em> (&#29289; <em>w&ugrave;</em> natural kinds). We,
humans and some other living things, learn <em>behaviors</em> in the
ways we learn to walk following paths. Confucians championed <em>human
paths</em> (&#20154; <em>r&eacute;n</em> &#36947;
<em>d&agrave;o</em>): historical social structures consisting of
<em>practices</em> (&#20107; <em>sh&igrave;</em> affair, business) by
named role players, a morality typified by <em>ceremonial ritual</em>
(&#31150; <em>l&#464;</em> decorum). Daoists favored wider
<em>natural</em> (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of the
<em>cosmos</em> (&#22825;&#22320; <em>ti&#257;nd&igrave;</em> heaven
&amp; earth) of which all the &ldquo;ten-thousand <em>natural
kinds</em>&rdquo; (&#29289; <em>w&ugrave;</em> things) are parts.
Living things occupy the space between <em>heaven</em> and
<em>earth</em> (&#22825;&#19979; <em>ti&#257;nxi&agrave;</em>
the-world-under heaven) and have <em>potential</em> (&#21487;
<em>k&#283;</em> permissible or possible) <em>paths</em> available for
their <em>behavior</em> (<em>x&iacute;ng</em>). These paths result
from the natural distribution of existing things in the
environment.</p>

<p>
The implicit axiom of <em>D&agrave;o</em>ism is there are
<em>permissible</em> paths in the natural world. <em>Nature</em> gives
us <em>virtuosity</em> (&#24503; <em>d&eacute;</em> virtue,
excellence) in finding, learning, and following these paths of
possibility. Learning from the past is a <em>permissible natural</em>
way to acquire this <em>virtuosity</em>. However, it is unlikely that
our current evolved social <em>practices</em> exhaust the
<em>permissible possibilities</em> of learning about <em>natural</em>
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. We can reform social practices, but in doing so,
we rely on ways of choosing among <em>d&agrave;o</em>s guiding that
reform. This is a key insight drawn from the Confucian-Mohist dispute.
Mozi&rsquo;s proposed reform process depended on an allegedly natural,
meta-<em>d&agrave;o</em> of measuring <em>utility</em> (&#21033;
<em>l&igrave;</em> benefit, harvest). This doesn&rsquo;t make reform
impossible or incoherent but initiates a regress of choosing ways
while still in momentum along a way. We measure <em>utility</em> using
existing concepts, ways of identifying <em>utility</em> and prefer it
to other ways of improving our current social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
The result is Daoism&rsquo;s version of normative autonomy, one that
starts from normative naturalism. It mimics mild skepticism. No matter
how we learn and choose, there may be some possibilities we overlook.
Its departure from Mohism lies in rejecting Mozi&rsquo;s assumption
that <em>nature</em> (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) <em>d&agrave;o</em> is
biased to benefit humans. <em>Nature</em> is neutral toward the ways
of life &ldquo;under the sky.&rdquo; Claiming to know
<em>nature&rsquo;s</em> intent is cognitively na&iuml;ve. A wholistic
path structure affords us <em>permissible/possible</em> 4-dimensional
future <em>behaviors</em>. That is natural <em>D&agrave;o.</em> It is
how things have and can unfold, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of our
4-dimensional past (and future). <em>D&agrave;o</em> is how
<em>natural kinds</em> are <em>born</em> (&#29983; <em>sh&#275;ng</em>
birth, life)&mdash;come to <em>exist</em> (&#26377; <em>y&#466;u
have</em>), change, evolve and eventually disappear (&#28961;
<em>w&uacute;</em> lack).</p>

<p>
Western &ldquo;things&rdquo; (parts of the world picked out by noun
phrases) are divided in China into <em>natural kinds</em> (&#29289;
<em>w&ugrave;</em>), <em>artifacts</em> (&#22120; <em>q&igrave;</em>
tools, utensils), and <em>practices</em> (<em>sh&igrave;</em>).
<em>Natural kinds</em> have internal <em>d&agrave;o</em>s (called
&#29702; <em>l&#464;</em> lanes-in-jade) that interacts with external
<em>road</em> structures. Our human internal <em>d&agrave;o</em>
(<em>l&#464;</em>) makes <em>learning</em> (&#23416;
<em>xu&eacute;</em> study, practice) and practiced <em>virtuosity</em>
possible. Individually and collectively, we learn and practice
<em>behaviors.</em></p>

<p>
Importantly, <em>d&agrave;o,</em> the structure of natural probability
is more like a map than a formula, rule or law. It is like a GPS of
life that gives us alternatives and suggests different paths we can
choose from: fastest, most scenic, calmest, etc. It consists of all
the <em>hows</em> of nature but explains only when made into a map
which humans can learn to read. Modern Daoists embrace science but
venerate (astro-physical) <em>nature</em>. Science is our best current
social <em>d&agrave;o</em> for understanding nature&rsquo;s structure,
certainly better than the classical <em>Yin-Yang</em> school&rsquo;s
tables of correlation. However, natural <em>d&agrave;o</em> does not
consist of commands or prohibitions, but of opportunities.</p>

<p>
<em>D&agrave;o</em> permeates the space-time cosmos, is everywhere
forever. It comes to have its structure <em>of itself</em>
(&#33258;&#28982; <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> naturally,
spontaneously, lit. self-make-so, realize from here). Chinese Daoism
is holistic or monist in the sense of the whole being <em>prior</em>
to its parts. <em>D&agrave;o</em> and the <em>cosmos exist</em>
(&#26377; <em>y&#466;u</em> have, being) and &ldquo;the ten thousand
<em>things</em> and I&rdquo; are <em>born, emerge</em> from as
<em>natural</em> parts of cosmic <em>d&agrave;o</em> (Laozi Ch. 1,
Zhuangzi 2:9). <em>D&agrave;o</em> unfolds into the future as every
part <em>self-realizes</em> (<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>) some
<em>possible</em> (<em>k&#283;</em>) <em>d&agrave;o</em> guiding how
it <em>walks</em> (&#34892; <em>x&iacute;ng</em>) into the future.</p>

<p>
Early phase Daoists, Hui Shi, Shen Dao and Laozi&rsquo;s <em>Daode
Jing</em> implicitly rejected parthood, suggesting an absolute,
Parmenidean, monism. Shen Dao&rsquo;s version was of a fatalistic
&ldquo;block universe&rdquo; in which nothing really happens. Priority
monism characterizes the bulk of the <em>Laozi</em> and
<em>Zhuangzi</em>. All the proper parts of <em>y&#466;u</em>, the
ten-thousand natural kinds, have <em>d&agrave;o</em>s which are proper
parts of the larger <em>daos</em>. The ultimate <em>d&agrave;o</em> is
a cosmic network of possible histories of possible thing-parts. Dao is
therefore constantly changing as things realize their possibilities.
The unrealized paths recede into the past.</p>

<p>
Controversies emerged within philosophical Daoism and between it and
rival philosophical agendas. We elaborate on these and the
implications of Daoist naturalism for linguistics, cosmology,
metaphysics, knowledge and ethics in the sections below. Religious
Daoism is a separate topic treated

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="His">1. History</h2>

<p>
We trace Daoism back to China&rsquo;s Classical philosophy period, the
Warring States (476&ndash;221 <small>BC</small>). It emerged in steps.
It began with the Duke of Zhou&rsquo;s (1038 <small>BC</small>) theory
of the priority of <em>sky-nature</em>&rsquo;s mandate over human
relationships as the basis of legitimacy of leadership. The Shang had
claimed authority as descendants of the &ldquo;Emperor Above.&rdquo;
The Duke argued that their incompetence led to their <em>natural</em>
replacement by the Zhou kings. Their ascent to the role of pathfinder,
leader of the world between sky and earth was <em>natural</em>
<em>naming</em> (&#21629; <em>m&igrave;ng</em> fate, luck, &#21517;
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> name, status) of the <em>leader</em> (&#29579;
<em>w&aacute;ng</em> king).</p>

<p>
Confucius historicized and rehabilitated the Shang
relationship-morality, but disgruntled dissidents would resort to
<em>nature</em> as anti-social hermits or agriculturalists citing folk
versions of philosophical quietism. An internal intellectual history
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 33) traces the trend through schools of fatalism,
treating <em>Great</em> <em>D&agrave;o</em> as fixed cosmic history
(Shen Dao) to Laozi&rsquo;s school rejecting social constructs. Both
rejected <em>linguistic terms</em> (&#21517; <em>m&iacute;ng</em>
names) and social practices in general as distorting our
<em>natural</em> guiding <em>capacity</em> (&#24503;
<em>d&eacute;</em> virtue) by instilling desires for social
status.</p>

<p>
Philosophical accounts treat <em>Zhuangzi</em> as the mature version
of Daoism. It accepted <em>and</em> emphasized how humans, natural
social creatures, coordinated behavior using &ldquo;sounds.&rdquo;
This makes <em>language</em> (&#35328; <em>y&aacute;n</em> speech,
words) part of the &ldquo;music of nature&rdquo;&mdash;along with
wind, birds, frogs and insects. Instead of eschewing language, the
mature version emphasized the plethora of <em>naturally</em> possible
<em>norms</em> (<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) of language use.</p>

<p>
The terms for the Daoist school (&#36947;&#23478;
<em>d&agrave;oji&#257;</em>) and its teachings (&#36947;&#25945;
<em>d&agrave;oji&agrave;o</em>) were both coined during the eclectic
Han dynasty following the Qin (221&ndash;206 <small>BC</small>)
repression. A cult worshipping The Yellow Emperor and Laozi (Huang
Lao) dominated Chinese officialdom. Pairing Laozi and Zhuangzi was not
automatic. Laozi&rsquo;s status in the religious ideology of the time
left the <em>Zhuangzi</em> to be studied mainly as a separate thinker
in the
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/han-dynasty/#KnowMethSyncHuai">Han Syncretic universe</a>,
 sometimes as a sourcebook for dissidents until the fall of the
Confucian dominated Han dynasty (206&ndash;220 <small>BC</small>).
That relative obscurity also enveloped the other philosophical trends
from the more vibrant <em>Hundred Schools</em> of the Classical,
<em>Warring States</em> period, the Mohists and dialecticians (Later
Mohists and School of Names).</p>

<p>
The Han blurred and blended Daoism with both the Yin-Yang school of
Zouyan and the superstitious divination of the <em>Book of
Changes</em>. All had an interest in understanding and finding
guidance in nature, but none yielded reliable know-how. Joseph Needham
(Needham 1986) famously (and controversially&mdash;see
 <a href="../chinese-phil-science/">Chinese Science</a>)
 argued that Daoist interest in nature was indirectly responsible for
the famous advances in Chinese &ldquo;Science.&rdquo; Daoist inclined
thinkers clearly did lead to the 20<sup>th</sup> C. surge of interest
in Western science (evolution) and logic (Needham 1986; Jin 2020).
Evolution was a particularly apt example of a natural
<em>d&agrave;o</em> linked to Zhuangzi&rsquo;s insistence that we are
a continuous part of nature&rsquo;s emergent creatures, exploring and
expanding into our environment. Big Bang theory would be the modern
version of Shen Dao&rsquo;s <em>Great D&agrave;o</em>.</p>

<p>
The Lao-Zhuang pairing was revived by the &ldquo;Dark Learning&rdquo;
school (also known as
 <a href="../neo-daoism/">Neo-Daoism</a>)
 which emerged in the wake of the Han collapse. Wang Bi (226-249)
curated the received <em>Laozi</em> (<em>Daode Jing</em>). Guo Xiang
later did the same with the <em>Zhuangzi</em>. Etymological
controversy still surrounds both results (Kline 2010), but when we
attribute anything to a named <em>master</em> (<em>z&#464;</em> son,
master), we are, in effect, attributing it to these evolved, now
conventionally accepted <em>master</em> texts.</p>

<p>
The slogan for the <em>Dark Learning</em> school&rsquo;s accommodation
with Han Dynastic Confucianism was &ldquo;Sage within; <em>king</em>
without.&rdquo; It became the &ldquo;common&rdquo; interpretation:
empty within (amoral), we conform to the ruling mores. This nihilistic
posture mediated the introduction of Buddhism into China, matching
concepts. Laozi worship adopted institutional structures from Buddhism
(monks, nuns and monasteries). In the process, the interpretation of
both converged into a distinctive Chinese Buddhism&mdash;Zen (&#31146;
ch&aacute;n meditation) Buddhism. Its naturalist spin on Buddhist
idealism eschewed the distinction between Nirvana and ordinary life
(Samsara). Everyone has Buddha-nature. Meditation equals ordinary
consciousness experienced in everyday behaviors, carrying water and
chopping wood (Feng and Bodde 1937).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every-moment Zen&rdquo; naturalism co-opted Buddhism&rsquo;s
denial of the ego and mind-body dualism, fitting it into
Daoism&rsquo;s practical naturalism. Skilled behavior is characterized
by loss of ego, the sense that the actor and instrument become one.
The emphasis on excellence in arts, behaviors, and skills linked Zen
and Zhuangzi&rsquo;s goal of perfecting ordinary life
pursuits--including butchering cattle! (Zhuangzi 3:2)</p>

<p>
Confucianism began to take Daoism and Buddhism (Zen especially) as
amoral twins but itself adopted a related metaphysical picture
grounding their ethics. Neo-Confucians report going through a youthful
Zhuangzi phase before settling into Confucianism built around the
metaphor of an <em>inner-lane</em> (<em>l&#464;</em>), a
&ldquo;path-like&rdquo; term used in translating &ldquo;dharma&rdquo;
(Buddhist <em>essence</em>). This allowed them to rehabilitate
Mencius&rsquo; moral psychology and link it to a cosmic normative
path-structure. The era of compatibility of Daoism and Confucianism
emerged. The more conservative accused &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;
Confucians with lowered commitment to the authority of ancient texts
of reverting to Zen or Daoism (Mad Channists).</p>

<p>
Orthodoxy minimized Zhuangzi&rsquo;s &ldquo;pluralist&rdquo;
normativity until the modern Western contact when it became identified
with science and democratic tolerance for many different ways of life.
Naturalist thinkers adopted Western logic and liberalism more quickly
and enthusiastically than did conservative Confucians, saw them as
cures for China&rsquo;s scientific and political backwardness.
Conservatives preferred a formula of keeping a Confucian base and
adopting Western technology only as a practical tactic. Li Zehou
reverses this May 4 slogan (Li 1986).</p>

<p>
Yan Fu (1854&ndash;1921) seemed most drawn to the theory of evolution,
which is a paradigm natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>. He translated and
popularized Western classics of science, logic and political
liberalism (J.S. Mill, Adam Smith, T.H. Huxley, Montesquieu, Spencer).
The enthusiasm for science reflects his conception of Daoism norm
naturalism and science as the study of natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>.
This modern embrace of logic contrasts with the resistance to both the
Buddhist and Jesuit logic, which Chinese intellectuals saw as
attempting to justify non-naturalism (Kurtz 2011). Tied to natural
science and pragmatic social-political thought, non-Confucian Chinese
intellectuals had no difficulty in embracing logic and science as
fully coherent with their historical naturalism.</p>

<p>
Jin Yuelin (1895&ndash;1964) concentrated even more on formal logic
combining it with his interpretation of Daoist <em>d&agrave;o</em> as
naturally possible course or process (Jin 2020). He completed the
project of conceiving of Daoism as a philosophical research paradigm
rather than the purely historical project of interpretation of Daoist
texts. His students included Hao Wang and Yin Haiguang whose student
Chen Guying has followed this conception of Daoism as an ethical
stance which aligns it more with environmental ethics,
Nietzsche&rsquo;s perspectivism, creativity, open-mindedness and
social-political tolerance and freedom (Chen et al. 2018). He
advocated Daoist philosophy replacing Confucianism as the distinctive
philosophical project of modern China.</p>

<p>
Some modern logicians who embrace paraconsistent logic also associate
that with Daoism (Priest and Garfield 2021; Tanaka 2004). That has
plausibility but not because Daoism is contradictory. The ancient
discussion did not revolve around semantic, epistemic Western
conceptions of &ldquo;true belief.&rdquo; The target of learning and
practice was know-how. The issues in contention were the social
know-how of traditional social practices vs. proposals for reform
guided by natural, cosmic <em>d&agrave;o</em>. Its &ldquo;logic&rdquo;
was navigating reality. The natural world guides how the region
&ldquo;under the sky&rdquo; <em>walks;</em> in walking the world of
living things changes its own natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6).</p>

<h2 id="DaoMet">2. The D&agrave;o Metaphor</h2>

<p>
The key feature of Daoist philosophical naturalism is the leading role
played by the metaphor of walking a physical &lsquo;path&rsquo;
(&#36947; d&agrave;o). It contrasts with the similarly key Western
focus on the contrast of laws and acts. See Mark Johnson (Lakoff and
Johnson 1980; Johnson 1992) on the role of bodily metaphor, Donald
Munro (1988), Chong Kim Chong (2006) and Edward Slingerland (2003) on
Chinese metaphorical reasoning and Shelly Kagan (1992) on normative
focal points).</p>

<p>
A millennium before their classical era, the oldest Chinese classics
told of the Duke of Zhou explaining the importance of
<em>virtuosity</em> (&#24503; <em>d&eacute;</em> virtue) in discerning
the course of <em>sky-nature</em> (&#22825; <em>ti&#257;n</em> Heaven)
to the young prince of Zhou. His family&rsquo;s <em>mandate</em>
(&#21629; <em>m&igrave;ng</em> fated role) is guiding <em>the social
world</em> (&#22825;&#19979; <em>ti&#257;nxi&agrave;</em> world under
the sky) on a path that avoids natural disaster. He contrasts the
precarious nature of his family&rsquo;s claim to leadership with the
Shang king&rsquo;s human relations claim of being the living
descendants of an &ldquo;emperor above.&rdquo; The presumed
&ldquo;permanence&rdquo; of the Shang claim to authority led the Shang
rulers to become careless and lead the world into <em>natural</em>
disasters. Thus, constant <em>sky-nature</em> chooses a leading family
with greater leadership <em>virtuosity</em>, better natural
pathfinders.</p>

<p>
This conception of social leadership eschewed rather than relied on
supernatural, rational authority to create and publish syntactic laws.
This chain of authority regress, the syntactic inference structure and
the strong deontic modal force all make Western norm naturalism more
of an intellectual challenge. The battery of historical Western
arguments against ethical naturalism flow from logical structures
linking normative laws to acts: &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t deduce
&lsquo;ought&rsquo; conclusions from &lsquo;is&rsquo; premises.&rdquo;
China&rsquo;s focus on path-like normativity made it less about
&ldquo;ought&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;duties&rdquo; than
<em>openings</em>, <em>possibilities,</em> and <em>permissions</em>
(&#21487; <em>k&#283;</em>) and role responsibility for
<em>realization</em> (&#28982; <em>r&aacute;n</em> making-so). That
left the status of punishment in disrepute among the classical
<em>masters</em> (albeit, extremely common and cruel in Ancient
China). Still, it made norm naturalism both easy and intuitive.</p>

<p>
Nature simply gives us <em>possible/permissible</em> openings for
behaviors (&#21487;&#36947; <em>k&#283;d&agrave;o</em>), it&rsquo;s up
to us to choose and <em>realize</em> those possibilities. Our doing so
is <em>natural</em> (&#33258;&#28982; <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>
self-so). This ancient launch of this normative dialectic foreshadows
the enduring Confucian-Daoist divide in Chinese thought. Both shared
the path and virtuosity metaphor but the Ru-Mo focus on human paths
and a distinctive <em>human</em> virtuosity, <em>humanity</em>
(&#20161; <em>r&eacute;n</em> benevolence). Confucians modeled
behavior on sages, parents&rsquo; behavior, older siblings, and
teachers. Confucius historicized the Shang afterlife hierarchy of
guiding authority, turning it sideways from a spiritual afterlife to
the natural history of past practice. Veneration of ancestors implies
emulating their remembered behavior, yielding the Confucian stress on
rituals and conventional mores. Daoist paths resemble more the paths
of water (<em>Laozi</em> 8 &amp; 78).</p>

<p>
Few experiences are more universal for bipedal humans than
identifying, choosing and walking on path-like natural structures.
Confucius and Mencius, like the Daoists opposed punishment
(<em>Analects</em> 13:3, Mencius IA:7). The authoritarian, Xunzi
stands out here in recommending <em>punishment</em> (&#21009;
<em>x&iacute;ng</em> corporeal cutting, mutilating), reasoning mainly
from traditional precedent, with slight nods to deterrence and
proportionality of desert.</p>

<p>
Western metaethical debates swirl around grammatical entities: laws
(rules, principles), duties (obligations, ought), facts, truths,
properties, and beliefs. These are hardly visible in Classical Chinese
reasoning about nature and normativity. That is a rarely noted insight
hiding behind the slogan that <em>d&agrave;o</em> is not in words.
Normativity is not about some authority&rsquo;s actual or possible
commands. What we collectively <em>know</em> <em>and teach</em> about
permissible ways of behaving (<em>k&#283;d&agrave;o</em>), convention
and tradition, changes over time. Nature thus teaches us this axiom of
Daoism&mdash;guiding <em>d&agrave;o</em>s can themselves be guided
(<em>Laozi</em> 1). We can follow a natural path of changing what we
teach and learn about <em>k&#283;d&agrave;o</em>. We also find such
meta-paths in <em>nature</em>.</p>

<p>
Mature Daoism begins with Zhuangzi&rsquo;s response to the Later
Mohist&rsquo;s discovery of a <em>reductio</em> of careless early
Daoist formulation of the insight that paths do not consist of words.
It seemed to eschew language. The Later Mohists toyed with similar
<em>reductios</em> of rejecting <em>learning</em> and of <em>dissing
(not-that-ing) not-that judgments</em>. Zhuangzi accepted the logical
force of those, then followed them to their logical conclusion.
Natural <em>d&agrave;o</em> includes as <em>parts</em> all the human
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s, those of communities, languages and social
practices. Confucianism <em>was</em> a natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>,
but one among many.</p>

<p>
Language and logic fit smoothly into Daoist <em>nature</em>. We can
view things logically through a Daoist lens and we can say what we
see. &ldquo;Daoism cannot be understood rationally&rdquo; logically
expresses lack of (rational, communicable) understanding of Daoism. It
is a permitted formula only for an irrational solipsist. While mature
Daoism rejected Shen Dao&rsquo;s fatalism, <em>d&agrave;o</em> is a
structure of both nomic and normative modality. Zhuangzi likens our
commitment to a <em>d&agrave;o</em> to walking or galloping momentum
along a path (Zhuangzi 2:2). Metaphorically, the structure of what
guides us is relativistic in the way physics is.</p>

<p>
The law and <em>d&agrave;o</em> metaphors have wide scope&mdash;they
answer both practical normative and nomic questions<em>.
D&agrave;o</em>s guide behaviors in an ongoing way. Properly followed,
they tell you <em>how</em> to do <em>what</em> a law might simply tell
you <em>to do</em>. Although <em>d&agrave;o</em>s have a nomic causal
role&mdash;<em>d&agrave;o</em> gives rise to 10,000 <em>natural
kinds</em> (<em>Laozi</em> 34, 39&ndash;40)&mdash;its
&ldquo;how&rdquo; is a natural structure, not necessarily an
<em>explanation</em> available to human understanding. There is a
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of the cosmos, but Daoism offers us no assurance
we can comprehend or understand it. Science may be the best human
<em>d&agrave;o</em> for learning about nomic <em>d&agrave;o</em>, but
still leaves us saying &ldquo;things happened
some-&lsquo;how.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>
<em>D&agrave;o</em> is not a force, cause, or substance. It is the
shape along which causal processes unfold. That shape comes from how
past natural processes arranged things. Power may come from
knowing-<em>d&agrave;o</em>, knowing how to follow it. As the
processes play out, things emerge and change. We may or may not be
able to formulate a verbal description, but the process evolves
<em>naturally</em> (&#33258;&#28982; &ldquo;of itself&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
The myriad <em>natural-kinds</em> have possible paths&mdash;ways the
future <em>may</em> go for them. Those potential histories become
actual when things &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; (&#33258;&#28982;
<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> self-so, spontaneously) follow, realize
or <em>make-so</em> one of their possible <em>behaviors</em> (Jin
2020). The parts of existing reality, the environment of which we are
a part, are all composed of <em>energy</em> (&#27683;
<em>q&igrave;</em> material energy, breath, stuff). Evolution is a
causal <em>d&agrave;o</em> mechanism that fills out this Daoist
naturalist view; it does not conflict with it. Nature (including our
own) unfolds to provide us with the capacities to exploit our
environment.</p>

<p>
Daoist normativity is more like navigation than obedience, loyalty, or
purification. Its defining deontic modality is more like permitting,
inviting, affording than the <em>law</em> metaphor&rsquo;s obligating,
requiring or forbidding. Epistemic normativity centers on learning and
knowing how to, not believing and knowing-that. These normative
stances contribute to Daoism&rsquo;s pragmatic take on language use.
Knowing an apple is something we do; we have learned how to
distinguish apples from non-apples. We know-how to identify apples in
our visual field&mdash;not how to have the phenomenal subjectivity,
but how to bring apples to attentional consciousness. We acquire this
ability along with learning how to pronounce and use the words in our
local dialect and how to combine those skills in speaking and
understanding each other.</p>

<p>
The continuity with animate life makes Daoist normativity sensitive to
environmental ethics, but not by being committed to animal rights,
duties, or free will. Animals have their possible
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s, learn behaviors that help them choose and
effectively pursue possibilities in their range of options. Daoism
regards animals as choosing their paths, being better and worse at
pursuing them, becoming better by learning, having social cooperation,
and even rudimentary communication. It is not committed to anything
like Western free will when it credits animals with role
responsibility, e.g., of a mother pig, or a bee scout, and judging
some members of a species <em>normatively better</em> than others.</p>

<p>
Natural normative guidance is an external, empirical conception of
norms. Norms evolve as all things practice, learn and improve at
following their <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. This adaptation includes their
recognizing clues about the structure of their environment&rsquo;s
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Within the Chinese philosophical framework, the
divide between nature and nurture is more significant than the
distinction between subjective phenomenal appearance and reality. The
contrast between natural <em>d&agrave;o</em> and social, human
<em>d&agrave;o</em> drives the Chinese epistemic dialectic. Our social
learning accumulates over generations. Communities&rsquo; mores and
conceptions of reality blend cooperative conformity with efficient
learning, reform and evolution. Daoists would appreciate how
twenty-first century science keeps discovering other <em>parts</em> of
life on earth that have counterparts of choices, better and worse
outcomes, and cultures that accumulate guidance.</p>

<p>
Humans <em>are</em> distinctive in having <em>more deliberate</em>
teaching (than, e.g., even meercats) and differ still more in their
capacity to use rich, flexible languages in this teaching and
learning. Learning and use in language communities magnifies the range
of a plethora of other learned social practices. The distinctive
important thing about humans is a magnified capacity for accumulation
of know-how by adapting and evolving languages as tools used in
collecting, sharing, organizing, and transmitting guidance.</p>

<p>
When we use language, especially in learning how to choose or
interpret <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, we can draw attention to signs in
situations that incline us toward a choice. In the West, we call those
external signs <em>reasons</em> and with the discovery of the proof,
the Greeks developed an elaborate theory of reasons. It yields a
capacity to ask for and give reasons in premise-conclusion form.
Modern Daoists have no reason to resist folding this Western scheme of
responding to reality into the terminology of <em>d&agrave;o</em> and
<em>l&#464;</em>. It embellishes rather than contradicts
Daoism&rsquo;s notion of human moral normativity. Reasons are the
perceptible signs of <em>d&agrave;o, d&agrave;o</em>s of choosing and
realizing <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Daoism&rsquo;s natural normativity is
continuous with other natural creatures&rsquo; know-how. The
distinctive human capacity for logic embellishes nature&rsquo;s
process of choosing and following <em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
The Daoist remembers that while language processing is an advanced
tool of knowing how, nature distributes know-how throughout the
<em>body</em> (&#39636; <em>t&iacute;</em> body-part). Knowing how to
make a knife out of stone involves muscle memory more than it does a
capacity to recite any string of words aloud. Even knowing how to use
language involves more than our cognitive faculty. Our tongues,
larynx, eyes and hands also <em>know how to</em> speak our
language.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s take-down of intuitionist Confucianism focuses on the
<em>guiding organ</em> (&#24515; <em>x&#299;n</em> heart, mind) and
recruits this corporate conception of how know-how spreads throughout
the body. It rejects internal authority; It authorizes no Confucian
homunculus as the decision maker for humans. No single organ is a
<em>zh&#275;n</em> (&#30495; natural, authentic, true) ruler. We
indeed choose, but we do not find any sign of authority (Zhuangzi
2:3). He does allow that the <em>heart</em> plays a role in the
decision process but is itself shaped by past bodily decisions
(learning and practice). The heart is neither incorrigible nor
authorized to rule over the other organs of the body.</p>

<p>
Larger parts composed of parts that are humans also <em>choose</em>
paths for the group (ditto for other social animals). A family, a
village, and a state can learn diverse ways of acting together, can
practice and improve these ways and evolve different <em>communal
paths.</em> This corporate conception of the body makes Daoist
perspectival relativism different from individualist egoism.
&ldquo;Common&rdquo; norms that emerge can persist because when they
prove useful at that stage in our evolution (Zhuangzi 2:6).</p>

<p>
<em>D&agrave;o</em>s can be <em>d&agrave;o</em>ed; they are not
constant. Names can be named; they are not constant (<em>Laozi</em>
Ch. 1).</p>

<h2 id="CosPhySci">3. Cosmology: Physicalism and Science</h2>

<p>
Most accounts portray Daoism as cosmology rather than metaphysics.
Unlike Buddhism, it does not address the mind-body problems that
traditionally defined Western metaphysics: objective reality vs
subjective conscious experience. Buddhism had addressed these issues
but, somewhat paradoxically, had denied both the ego and mind-body
dualism; Daoism&rsquo;s (Chan-Zen&rsquo;s) response is
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s not talk that talk.&rdquo; It refuses to waste time
even denying idealism or solipsism: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m carving an ox
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Contemporary metaphysics does countenance naturalism as a part-whole
metaphysics. Pre-Buddhist Chinese (Later Mohist) metaphysics seems
similar (Hansen 1983). and Daoist cosmology is a generalization of
that metaphysics (Banka 2023). Chinese naturalism, aside from the
concept of <em>d&agrave;o,</em> would strike Westerners as na&iuml;ve,
peasant natural wisdom. We are in a world with tens of thousands of
nameable natural parts: mountains, trees, water, oxen horses, fish,
and humans. These are parts of a single <em>reality</em>
(&#26377;exist, to have). Their <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are entangled; we
and they <em>walk</em> our respective paths, our parts of
nature&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em>. <em>D&agrave;o,</em>
<em>y&#466;u</em> and <em>thing</em>-like parts ground this naturalist
metaphysics. The names of &ldquo;ten-thousand kinds&rdquo;
(&#33836;&#29289; <em>w&agrave;nw&ugrave;</em> myriad things) are
cosmological details.</p>

<p>
<em>Thing-parts</em> (&#39636; <em>t&iacute;</em>) are not
rationalism&rsquo;s sentence-filling objects, i.e., subject-substances
<em>with</em> predicate-properties. Chinese places <em>things</em> in
their <em>d&agrave;o</em> metaphor. A thing is any proper part (of the
one) that has a <em>d&agrave;o</em>. Monism means any part&rsquo;s
<em>d&agrave;o</em> is part of nature&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o.</em> A
part unfolds or evolves in ways dependent on the paths of other parts.
No part is more real or basic than the natural universe itself.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;I&rdquo; (ego, self) is not a point substance, but a
cluster of local perspectives on <em>d&agrave;o</em>, our points of
view on the possibilities open to us given the distribution of other
parts. My point of view includes that of my family, my profession, my
sports teams, my class, nation etc. On the other side, the parts of my
physical form. My heart and lungs, veins and brains have their roles
to play in <em>my</em> <em>d&agrave;o</em> (Zhuangzi 2:3).</p>

<p>
Cosmological theories of some evolutionary mechanism&mdash;whether it
is Yin-Yang theory or biological inheritance or viral cultural
memes&mdash;explain the emergence, change and disappearance of natural
parts. Daoism is committed to paths of nomic (causal) possibility and
open to many conceptions of their mechanism. D&agrave;o is not a
force. It is the paths forces can travel. D&agrave;o gives rise to,
sustains (guides), and eventually eliminates things. Evolution and
cosmic inflation theory are paradigms of natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s,
not laws. Evolution was possible, but not necessary, before
inflation.</p>

<p>
Ancient <em>z&#464;</em> (masters) may not have known that
<em>sun</em> (&#26085; <em>r&igrave;</em> sun, day) refers to a huge
sphere of hydrogen. They did accept a theory of language that links
the character&#26085; to that physical object through a social
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of its use. <em>D&agrave;o</em> refers to the
course of nature <em>whatever it turns out to be.</em> The Yin-Yang
school&rsquo;s theory of things emerging from mixing Yin and Yang
<em>q&igrave;</em> was their theory of <em>d&agrave;o</em>.</p>

<p>
Modern Daoists embraced Western science, but Daoism is a philosophy of
naturalism, not of science itself. It doesn&rsquo;t tell us about
science but accepts that science is good-at telling us about
<em>d&agrave;o.</em> Science does not choose <em>d&agrave;o</em>s but
gives us what helps us choose well. Science also exemplifies the kind
of social-cultural d&agrave;o Daoism favors: non-authoritarian,
self-correcting, open-minded and experimental. It is a better choice
for teaching, learning, understanding, finding and following
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s than was either Yin-Yang theory or Buddhism.</p>

<p>
Daoism does not treat either atoms or egos as ultimate building
blocks. Natural <em>d&agrave;o</em> guides all unfolding of parts of
<em>being.</em> The metaphysical framework allows new <em>things</em>
to emerge as other <em>things</em> <em>self-realize</em> their
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s (DDJ 17, 23, 25, 51, 64). This makes Daoist
metaphysics resemble religion in assigning the source of normative
guidance to something outside the ego, but not to a supernatural ego.
It is not that the universe is a living thing, but that evolution is a
cosmic model of natural change.</p>

<p>
Human learning is a form of change. It starts from an internal
path-like structure (&#29702; <em>l&#464;</em> lane, principle,
coherence) that makes it possible to change itself to adapt to
external daos in one&rsquo;s environment&mdash;acquiring
<em>d&eacute;.</em> Human epistemic and normative <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
emerge. It is not obvious precisely where the boundary of emergence
from purely causal to normative-causal lies. The biosphere emerged
from the interaction of parts of a larger cosmic reality which unfolds
with little hint of the human normative guidance familiar in our
lives. We do observe a surprising degree of gradualism with signs of
guidance in other primates, living things and increasingly plants. In
that greater <em>d&agrave;o</em>, pan-norm-ism of a barely
comprehensible sort may be possible. What we know is things change and
human normative (<em>d&agrave;o</em>able) d&agrave;os emerge, change,
and recede into the past.</p>

<p>
Daoism is not metaphysically committed to materialism, though its
cosmology was and is broadly physicalist. Classical Daoism relied more
on the ancient concept of <em>ether</em> (&#27683; <em>q&igrave;</em>
matter, air, breath, energy) than it did Zou Yan&rsquo;s division of
it into two types: Yin and Yang. Another traditional mechanism was the
five <em>processes</em> (&#34892; <em>x&iacute;ng</em> walk:behavior),
named after the elements that underwent them, fire, water, metal, air,
and earth. Recognizing <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of over 200 elements takes
more natural perspectives into account. Abandoning traditional Chinese
cosmology need not entail abandoning <em>Daoist</em> metaphysics.
<em>D&agrave;o</em> made possible the emergence of a sphere of change
(<em>y&#466;u</em>). Science is good at detailing <em>how</em> nature
unfolds.</p>

<p>
Daoism views existence (<em>y&#466;u</em>) and its probability
structure (<em>d&agrave;o</em>) as metaphysical givens. The cosmos
(&#22825;&#22320; <em>ti&#257;nd&igrave;</em> sky-earth) contains all
<em>y&#466;u</em> and is bounded by <em>nothing</em> (&#28961;
<em>w&uacute;</em> lack) (<em>Laozi</em> 1). Things are in constant
(space-time) mereological flux. Facts, but not natural kinds, are
human constructions using the model of sentences of human language.
Facts figure in semantics (truth, belief) and in epistemics (reason,
sense experience) (Chen 2019).</p>

<p>
<em>Y&#466;u</em> and <em>d&agrave;o</em> are one and yet constantly
changing as new realities (parts of <em>y&#466;u</em> and the relative
parts of <em>d&agrave;o</em>) emerge. <em>D&agrave;o</em> and
<em>y&#466;u</em> overlap all of space-time but differ in the
principles that restrict how they unfold in emergent parts (Banka
2023). Parts, <em>things,</em> include <em>natural-kinds</em>
(&#29289; <em>w&ugrave;</em>), <em>artifacts</em> (&#22120;
<em>q&igrave;</em> tools, utensils, socially constructed things) and
<em>affairs</em> (&#20107; <em>sh&igrave;</em> business, socially
constructed processes). Those parts of being also have parts guided by
parts of the larger <em>d&agrave;o</em> of which they are parts.</p>

<p>
D&agrave;o is the structure of possible histories of <em>things.</em>
<em>There are</em> (<em>y&#466;u</em> have, exist) wood and feathers;
<em>y&#466;u</em> bows and arrows; <em>y&#466;u</em> archery
tournaments. For each part of reality to exist, there are parts of
<em>d&agrave;o</em> guiding their emergence, their <em>normal</em>
course of being and their ending. Causation (possibility and
probability) is rooted in these <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, natural
processes; human scientific understanding uses laws (descriptions of
constant d&agrave;os) and deductive derivation of event (fact)
causation. Skilled navigation of these humanly knowable causal courses
of unfolding provides normative guidance.</p>

<p>
Modern Daoists, notably Yan Fu, Hu Shi, Jin Yuelin, Yin Haiguang,
Zhang Dainian and Chen Guying, were drawn to science and logic. Jin
Yuelin translated his own use of q&igrave; as "stuff," not
metaphysical &ldquo;matter,&rdquo; reinforcing Daoism&rsquo;s purely
monistic, mereological structure. His stuff is &ldquo;empty&rdquo;
prior to its entering into concrete possibility, becoming a possible
thing distinguishable from what is <em>f&#275;i&mdash;</em>not that
thing. The tradition treated light as one form of q&igrave;, because
it travels in straight lines. Daoism need not presuppose any
particular account of the stuff of nature, but it will have potential
to unfold the lines of d&agrave;o to constitute part of
<em>y&#466;u,</em> a <em>something</em> that follows or realizes
d&agrave;os of possibility.</p>

<p>
Daoist perspectives on evolution emphasize finding and exploiting
niches (<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) in the environment. Daoist evolution
meshes with the Chinese focus on social
cooperation&mdash;Zhuangzi&rsquo;s &#20841;&#34892; following two
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s together (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6). It&rsquo;s less
tied to the Western emphasis on competition and struggle for survival
than on working together to gain and store knowledge of natural
d&agrave;os. Evolution involves discovering natural paths of
opportunity but without depicting nature as friend (the Mohist
position) or enemy (the West). We do not lead or control evolution,
but entangle ourselves with it as we learn and practice behaviors to
navigate our environment.</p>

<h2 id="DaoDeNorPiv">4. <em>D&agrave;o-d&eacute;</em> Norm Pivots</h2>

<p>
The conceptual pivots of the Classical <em>d&agrave;o</em>-following
metaphorical gestalt shaped the mechanism for its understanding of
natural guidance as norm causation. It frames Daoist metaphysics,
epistemology and ethics. The central elements were:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>an external structure accessible for guidance,
<em>d&agrave;os</em>;</li>

<li>a &ldquo;walker&rdquo;; the external structure (a) guides the
walker&rsquo;s <em>conduct/behavior</em> (&#34892;
<em>x&iacute;ng</em> walk:behave) and</li>

<li>the internal <em>capacity/virtuosity</em> (&#24503;
<em>d&eacute;</em>) within (b) to use (a)&rsquo;s structure to realize
in real-time a behavior that follows that path through the
environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The metaphorical elements can be seen easily in the ancient form of
the character for <em>d&eacute;</em> (&#24503;) here:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="The ancient Chinese character for capacity/virtuosity (de). The visual components of the character are described in the main text below." class="nocaption" src="de-ancient-form.png" style="height:75px; width:75px" />
</div>

<p>
Note that it metaphorically outlines the norm-following capacity by
linking the three elements symbolically. The indexing component on the
left, originally the left side of a crossroad-like graph, is also the
left side of the character for <em>behavior/conduct</em> (&#34892;
<em>x&iacute;ng</em>). The component on the top right is composed of
an eye (&#30446;) and a line or crossroad. On the bottom right is the
ancient Chinese graphic form of a heart (&#9825;). Practiced learning
stored in the heart interacts with information from the senses about
external possibilities for learned behavior to fit that
possibility.</p>

<p>
The path metaphor had three implicit phases. One is knowing-of paths,
becoming aware of a possibility for the exercise of a
<em>behavior</em>. The second is choosing it&mdash;usually with a
&ldquo;This!&rdquo; (&#26159; <em>sh&igrave;</em>) or a
&ldquo;Not-that!&rdquo; (&#38750; <em>f&#275;i</em>) for
<em>other</em> paths. Then we exercise some behavior to realize the
possibility. Realizing it <em>in our way</em> is like musical or role
<em>interpretation</em>. We interpret by <em>walking</em>
(<em>x&iacute;ng</em>) that path. We can evaluate that
<em>interpretation</em> as <em>good-at</em> (&#21892;
<em>sh&agrave;n</em>) or <em>beautiful</em> (&#32654;
<em>m&#283;i</em>). Ancient Ru-Mo use of the metaphor centered on
human, socially constructed norms, mores and viewed humans as social,
as pursuing cooperative behavior (massive public works like
controlling the Yellow River&rsquo;s flooding).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s later contemporary, Xunzi, elaborated the shared
conception of heart&rsquo;s guidance function more fully. The senses
deliver the path information to the <em>guiding organ</em> (&#24515;
<em>x&#299;n</em> heart, mind, heart-mind) in the form of
<em>distinctions</em> (<em>bi&agrave;n</em> &#36783; analysis,
argument, dispute) between <em>differences</em> (&#30064;
<em>y&igrave;</em>) marking the boundaries of a <em>thing</em>. The
<em>x&#299;n</em> also monitors internal <em>moods</em> (&#24773;
<em>q&iacute;ng</em> feelings, facts, reality) that emerge internally
reflecting the situation. The heart <em>differentiates</em> (&#36783;
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> distinguish) among them. These <em>qing</em>
(attitudes) generate <em>desires</em> (&#27442; <em>y&ugrave;</em>)
for things. The Confucian Xunzi thought the <em>desires</em> were
natural and irreducible; Mozi and the Daoists school treated only some
as natural, others as also socially constructed using names.
Eliminating those frees us from social domination of our desires and
sensitivity to differences. Using this external and internally
gathered information, the <em>x&#299;n</em> issues normative
<em>permissible</em> (&#21487; <em>k&#283;</em> may, can) and
<em>this-not that</em> (&#26159;&#38750; <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
right-wrong) judgments evaluating paths as possibilities and
initiating guided <em>behavior</em> (&#34892; <em>x&iacute;ng</em>
walk, conduct) (Xunzi 22:2&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
Daoism&rsquo;s normative naturalism thus makes human morality a
continuation of natural guidance as found in other <em>things</em>
(Zhuangzi 12:8). The paths of inanimate things are possibilities of
causal processes for them given their inherent <em>inner
processes</em> (their &#29702; <em>l&#464;</em>) which resonate with
external possibilities and their adaptive <em>virtuosities</em>
(<em>d&eacute;</em>). Learning typifies animal adaptations. It
transforms their inner structure (whether by the evolutionary process
or past practice). The interaction of the inner and outer in the
unfolding of history results in their <em>d&eacute;.</em></p>

<p>
From water and wind to ants and bees, tigers and elephants, we
understand this <em>self-realizing</em> (&#33258;&#28982;
<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> natural) behavior in terms of the
metaphor of finding and following paths. Human morality does not
require a prior emergence of reasons or a <em>Geist</em> with a
property of reason or faculty to engage in a process of reasoning. The
capacity which both unites and separates humans from other things is
learning-how. Where human learning takes a quantum leap is with the
addition of social practices and languages. These which underwrites
iteration of <em>d&agrave;o</em> guidance&mdash;we can guide how
natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s guide us.</p>

<p>
The form of learning and of knowing is knowing-how. We don&rsquo;t
evolve language to express inner thoughts, but to facilitate learning,
including learning to cooperate. The Ru-Mo treated the evolution of
social cooperation as distinctively human; Zhuangzi seemed to sense
how it runs through living things as does signaling to coordinate
behavior to enhance group knowing-of and know-how. Our learning how
stems from apprentice learning, typically on the <em>school</em>
(&#23478; <em>ji&#257;</em> family) model.</p>

<p>
Daoism sees language as continuous with maps, cairns, blazing trees
etc. The use of pictographs and words emerges naturally in this
socially cooperative species. Creature vocalization, found elsewhere,
we recruit in training, practicing, planning and shared decision
procedures. Modern Daoists would acknowledge the role of sentences,
syntax and logic in this process and the surprising discovery that
human model emulation values accuracy of mimicry over achieving an
outcome. Hence our tendency to superstitions and religious rituals.
While this enhances our tendency to transmit cultural forms and
conventional practices and aesthetic styles, Daoists see it as leading
to Ru-Mo dogmatism and speciesism. Thus, Daoists emphasize open-minded
skepticism, and thinking outside the box. As one of the smaller group
of cooperating creatures using intentional teaching and of even fewer
whose learning accumulates across generations, we should suspect the
value of elegant signaling, of symbolic commitments. We should
recognize our own tendency to superstitious behavior and fondness for
symbolic commitment. Daoism&rsquo;s self-critical motivation for
reform, however, still values aesthetic creativity for its own sake
where the Mohists&rsquo; rejected it.</p>

<p>
The path metaphor does give us a way to understand the emergence of
reasoning. We can diagram the connectives of propositional calculus as
paths&mdash;<em>not</em>-gates, <em>and</em>-gates, <em>or</em>-gates
and <em>if-then-</em>gates. Path awareness also gives us a more
objective conception of the theory of mind. The scientific mirror
neuron phenomenon meshes easily with the <em>d&agrave;o-d&eacute;</em>
metaphor structure. We know what it is like to contemplate the paths
available to others. We don&rsquo;t need a counterpart of mind-reading
to simulate their <em>d&eacute;</em> and estimate where they are
walking.</p>

<p>
The path metaphor would be less likely to invite the
&ldquo;fundamental attribution error&rdquo; (explaining behavior by
psychology rather than situation) (Nisbett and Ross 1980). Some
comparative cultural psychologists have experimentally concluded that
East Asians are less prone to the error (Mason and Morris 2010; Masuda
and Nisbett 2001). The use of a path rather than a law metaphor as a
normative focal point could play a role in explaining that result.
Empathy is less a matter of mirroring another&rsquo;s conscious state
as is knowing how to navigate from another&rsquo;s position and
momentum in their environment, thus it guides us to avoid colliding
even as we pursue separate goals. The path metaphor can invoke common
<em>d&eacute;</em> to explain theory of mind simulation.</p>

<p>
The most frequent translation of the nearest Chinese concept,
&ldquo;heart-mind,&rdquo; invites misunderstanding by importing the
Western <em>spectator</em> and <em>container</em> concept of
&lsquo;mind.&rsquo; It does reflect the important insight that a
single organ, the brain, processes both belief <em>and</em> desire.
Munro&rsquo;s (2001) translation, &ldquo;guiding organ&rdquo; avoids
the misunderstanding, removing the invitation to attribute the
West&rsquo;s &ldquo;belief-desire&rdquo; explanation of human action
and agency. Chinese behavior theory commits them only to internal
paths among the organs for processing sensory information and guiding
<em>behavior</em> (<em>walking</em>). Zhuangzi allows that the heart
functions in these decisions but denies its performative authority.
Nature distributes expertise (know-how) through all the &ldquo;hundred
joints, nine openings, and six inward parts.&rdquo; Still, he
acknowledges the role of the heart&rsquo;s reactive <em>moods</em>
(<em>q&iacute;ng</em>) that &ldquo;pop-up before us day and
night,&rdquo; without which there would be no choosing and no
&ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
While sight dominates the metaphorical structure of the
<em>d&eacute;</em> character, all the senses and feelings work
together to guide behavior in the empirically sensed external
environment. Hearing also plays a vital role. It&rsquo;s especially
linked to social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s and figures centrally in
coordinating behavior, whether in music, chanting or speech (Geaney
2010).</p>

<p>
Although the <em>d&agrave;o-d&eacute;</em> metaphor starts from the
point of view of the human &ldquo;I,&rdquo; we naturally project it on
inanimate objects but also on larger forms of life. Personification in
China need only project on things a capacity to realize its
possibilities, not inner conscious states. Families, communities,
nation-states and species can be said to have know-how and cognitive
achievement may be distributed in various ways among parts of the
social unit. Non-human living groups may find, choose, and pursue
paths&mdash;and have <em>internal d&agrave;o</em>s of choosing and
allocating in the process, e.g., quorum-sensing in ants, bees etc.</p>

<p>
While Laozi suggests &ldquo;normative&rdquo; causation is similar in,
e.g., water and other inanimate objects, it is part of his rejection
of language and learning. Water is naturally &ldquo;good at&rdquo;
finding its way (<em>Laozi</em> 8). However, when Shen Dao draws
fatalistic conclusions from the metaphorical picture, the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> marks the error as confusing human
<em>d&agrave;o</em> with the <em>d&agrave;o</em> of dead things
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 33:4). The crucial difference is the ability to
learn and know-how to find and follow <em>d&agrave;o</em>s (how to
<em>walk</em>). The inner process would be a
<em>d&agrave;o-d&eacute;</em> rather than a given material
<em>disposition</em> (&#29702; <em>l&#464;</em> lane) resonating with
possibility.</p>

<p>
Daoist <em>d&eacute;</em> is not a free-standing inner source of
absolute normative guidance. It results from past real-world practice.
Ru-Mo&rsquo;s use of the metaphor privileges a humanist
<em>virtuosity</em> arising either from respect for models or
teleological universal human well-being. Daoist&rsquo;s is more
open-ended and may evolve in directions we realize to be moral after
we reform mores in diverse ways.</p>

<p>
Ethics, <em>d&agrave;od&eacute;</em>, then is how <em>we</em> navigate
the actual world. What is the scope of &ldquo;we&rdquo;? The Classical
conception was all <em>under the sky</em> (&#22825;&#19979;
<em>ti&#257;n xi&agrave;</em>). Daoist <em>ethics</em> easily embraces
environmentalism; we are part of the world of living things and find,
choose, and follow daos from that perspective as well as the other
parts of which we are parts. <em>Ethics</em> is in the title
(accidentally?) of <em>Laozi</em>&rsquo;s classic,
<em>D&agrave;od&eacute; J&#299;ng</em> canon-of-ethics. The compound
became common toward the end of the Warring States philosophical
period (Liu 2020). <em>D&eacute;</em> was also frequently paired with
<em>walking</em> (<em>d&eacute;x&iacute;ng</em>)&mdash;virtuoso
path-following.</p>

<p>
We find ethical guidance in the natural world. We can be better or
worse at reading and following it. Chinese thought holds that
education and practice helps. Daoists de-emphasize <em>our
particular</em> (e.g., Chinese) traditional practice, any
<em>natural</em> learning helps.</p>

<h2 id="NorMorMor">5. Norms, Mores &amp; Morality</h2>

<p>
Norms are <em>d&agrave;o</em>s woven into the fabric of nature by the
past. Daoist conception of norms differs from the Ru-Mo in:</p>

<ol>

<li>They focus on natural <em>and</em> social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
(norms),</li>

<li>They are skeptical of authority and speciesism (humanism),
and</li>

<li>They reflect from a detached perspective on the Ru-Mo moral
dispute.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Daoism has a more broadly naturalist conception of the emergence of
<em>norms</em>. Cosmic history wears <em>d&agrave;o</em>-like
structures in the distribution of <em>stuff</em> into <em>things.</em>
The parts of <em>d&agrave;o</em> guiding natural living creatures are
those knowable by them. Their <em>walking</em> these paths of
possibility wears them into the natural and/or social environment. As
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s and their practitioners evolve, the
<em>paths</em> become and deeper, wider and more attractive ways and
the practitioners become more adept at following them.
<em>D&agrave;o</em>, thus, constantly changes, evolves as do the
things following <em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
Confucians and Mohists called their <em>social</em> paths
<em>ritual</em> (&#31150; <em>l&#464;</em> decorum, ceremony). The
role players shaped by them and capable of following them have a named
status. The group followed its moral norm when the performers followed
the norms for their named role <em>well</em> (&#21892;sh&agrave;n
good-at). Confucius analogized the performance to artistic group
performance, paradigmatically a musical <em>entertainment</em>
(&#27138; <em>l&egrave;/y&ugrave;e</em> joy, pleasure music).
Confucius&rsquo; was an aesthetic conception of mores and etiquette
with faint (but persistent) echoes of their religious heritage (Hall
and Ames 1987). The goal of the performance was its inherent
<em>beauty</em>, not obeying the afterlife ancestors of the Shang. The
religious focus persisted in its ineliminable reliance on a maestro
leader, the sage or authoritative <em>gentlemen</em>. His judgment was
the standard of teaching and reform and coordination of players.</p>

<p>
Mohists jettisoned this form of authority and the aesthetic focus and
blended the evolved religious attitude toward <em>natural</em> social
norms with a &ldquo;<em>natural</em>&rdquo; goal (&#22825;&#24535;
<em>ti&#257;nzh&igrave;</em> sky-nature will) of universal
<em>human</em> well-being. This <em>d&agrave;o</em> utilitarianism
(Hansen 1989) justified reforming past practice and could appeal to a
more epistemically objective (measurable) and universal standard
(<em>Mozi</em> 9B:2). This reduced but could not eliminate the
reliance on authority&mdash;in organizing and evaluating the process
of reform and in following the humanist benefit standard. The
philosophically interesting feature of Mohist utilitarianism is its
focus on social mores, rather than <em>rules</em> or <em>acts</em>. We
behave according to social mores that society actively chooses and
that evolve in use <em>guided</em> by utilitarian measurement
standards.</p>

<p>
This dispute had classical <em>masters</em> focused on mores and
meta-<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. The Mohists called the target of their
reform process <em>morality</em> (&#32681; <em>y&igrave;</em>
righteousness, duty, right). Individual guidance was correct practice
of the reformed mores and participating in the reform process. Their
meta-<em>d&agrave;o</em> was
 sky-nature<a name="a"></a>&rsquo;s
 <em>objective standard</em>: universal utility. This forced
Confucians into a defense with an alternative two-tier account of
morality, i.e., correct <em>mores</em> (l&#464;). The individual
follows a &ldquo;correctly rectified&rdquo; traditional system of
<em>rituals</em>. One wing of Confucianism relied on scholar authority
and another on &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo; intuition to mount this
defense. Their respective meta-<em>d&agrave;os</em> also came into
play in the interpretation phase, resulting in individual
<em>d&agrave;os</em> of performing a <em>ritual-music</em> role
<em>well</em>.</p>

<p>
Ru-Mo agreed in calling the <em>successful</em> (&#25104;
<em>ch&eacute;ng</em> mature, complete) project of reform
<em>morality</em> (<em>y&igrave;</em>). They further agreed on the
internal <em>d&eacute;</em> that chooses the reform: <em>humanity</em>
(&#20161; <em>r&eacute;n</em> benevolence, conscientiousness). The
Mencius wing amounts to virtue utilitarianism so began to emphasize
that <em>r&eacute;n</em> was rooted and learned first in filial
concern and only gradually and in grades becoming universal
<em>humanism.</em> Other natural creatures were not the proper objects
of sympathy or compassion. Nature, Xunzi argued, intended humans to
dominate and enslave animals. They began to construe their
disagreement with Mozi as universal vs. partial <em>love</em>
(&#24859; <em>a&igrave;</em> favor, prefer).</p>

<p>
Confucians depicted Mozi&rsquo;s universal humanism as more
authoritarian than their own. Mozi did rely on a <em>natural
master</em> (&#22825;&#23376; <em>ti&#257;nz&#464;</em> Son of
Heaven). All the philosophers of the period were called
<em>z&#464;</em> and Mozi portrayed <em>the social world</em>
selecting the <em>natural master</em> by unanimous acclamation that he
was &ldquo;wisest and best.&rdquo; The <em>natural master</em>
immediately announced he was epistemically not up to the task. So, he
selected the &ldquo;next best&rdquo; as helpers. Similarly, they pled
ignorance and selected the third best and so on down to the bottom of
the social hierarchy.</p>

<p>
Then they consulted those on the <em>bottom</em> for their judgments
of <em>this</em> and <em>not-that</em>. These first-order moral
judgments were then &ldquo;synthesized&rdquo; by the selected
authority at the next level up and reported up the chain, with each
synthesizing (somehow?) the moral judgments and reporting these up the
chain of wise men until the <em>natural master</em> ultimately
synthesized the final set of norms. Then everyone followed that system
of social mores. Mozi averred that the result would coincide with the
this/not-that judgment of <em>nature</em> (<em>ti&#257;n</em>), i.e.,
utilitarian social mores.</p>

<p>
Both the selection of the <em>master</em> initiating the reform
process and the reliance on first-order normative judgments suggest a
tilt toward a democracy of moral construction cum judicial appeal. The
residual reliance on authority involved a) <em>sky-nature</em> itself,
which Mozi claimed <em>willed</em> (<em>zh&igrave;</em>) the utility
standard, and b) the universally acclaimed hierarchy of judges doing
the synthesizing of differing moral opinions reported from below. Mozi
endorsed punishment for those refusing to participate in the
process.</p>

<p>
The output was a shared, reformed morality and we all accept its
<em>this</em>&rsquo;s and <em>not-that</em>&rsquo;s. The democratic
component was merely a computational device to make every human
judgement count equally. There would no longer be moral disagreement
and the humanly constructed moral <em>d&agrave;o</em> would guide us
all. Mozi had no theory of popular sovereignty conferring a right to
command society at large!</p>

<p>
Daoism responded to this dialectic by embracing both perspectives,
seeing Mohism as a sound improvement, but rejecting the demanding
imperial utilitarian morality. It reflects on how to pursue the
dialogue to a naturalistic conclusion. Their skeptical relativist
position emerged in two phases. The first eschewed talk of both social
mores and morality in favor of physical paths in the broader natural
environment with the path and <em>virtuosity</em> of water a model of
navigating the natural environment. Famous hermits in literature
avoided all social entanglements. Laozi interpreted naturalism as
excluding human <em>d&agrave;o</em>s and concluded we should avoid
learning words and language along with other socially valued objects
and status roles.</p>

<p>
The second, mature phase of Daoism associated with Zhuangzi emphasized
that humans were as natural as nature&rsquo;s other living creatures.
Human speech is as natural as other natural sounds; practice weaves
human social arrangements into the structure of natural
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. He pushed Mozi&rsquo;s first-order democracy to
its logical conclusion. No one has the wisdom to say what is moral or
what words to use. We &ldquo;vote for&rdquo; our <em>d&agrave;o</em>
by walking it. The outcome is a naturally evolving society and
language.</p>

<p>
The upshot is that <em>nature</em> is not a normative authority for
mature Daoism in the way it was for Mohism. The guide for choosing and
interpreting norms is also one of many possible <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
for the tasks. We naturally interpret and practice our own
society&rsquo;s social norms in various <em>ways</em>, various ways of
choosing and practically interpreting, <em>walking</em> each iterative
<em>way</em>. As we do, the way is constantly changing. D&agrave;o can
be d&agrave;o-ed (Laozi 1:1).</p>

<p>
As humans <em>walk</em> their <em>norms</em> in different
<em>way</em>s, they wear small variations into their physical
<em>and</em> social environment thus changing the guiding structure.
The normative guides were multiple existing, evolving paths through
space-time. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism is famous, but it is seldom
noticed that Mozi&rsquo;s <em>natural masters</em>, the &ldquo;wisest
and best in the world of living things&rdquo; knew they did not know
how to rectify mores into morality. Zhuangzi simply takes the point
seriously--neither he nor anyone else was in a privileged position to
select behaviors for all living things. Each must be its own judge in
each situation.</p>

<p>
His emphasis, in contrast to Laozi&rsquo;s purely physical nature
(e.g., water), was on other forms of life with a live appreciation of
how each was somehow capable of finding, choosing and following
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s in their local situation from their individual
perspective. That appreciation emerges as curiosity and open-minded
engagement, fantasy dialogues, in which he asks the natural thing for
its own account of its own know-how.</p>

<p>
The earlier phase of Daoism could not survive the Mohist
<em>reductio</em> of its implicit rejection of language.
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s mature naturalism avoided both species-favoring
humanism and self-defeating quietism. We cannot fairly accuse Zhuangzi
of opposing morality. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s posture allowed him to be a
realist moral skeptic. Neither he, nor anyone else is in a position to
know the right <em>d&agrave;o</em> for everyone. It does not entail
moral nihilism; moral construction may converge on one or several
fully evolved moralities.</p>

<p>
The result explains Zhuangzi&rsquo;s seeming backtracking from
primitive Daoism&rsquo;s hermit-like withdrawal from social
structures. He <em>permits</em> following <em>the usual</em>, the
communicable, and thus the useful. Conforming to social norms enables
one to coordinate with others, to &ldquo;walk two paths,&rdquo; to be
in <em>harmony</em> (&#21644; <em>h&eacute;</em> peace) with others.
Social norms create legitimate expectations in others and following
them allows us to maximize the range of <em>joint</em> cooperative
behaviors we can choose. This is the serious, but non-authoritative
naturalist response to the Confucian-Mohist moral dialectic.</p>

<p>
This allows mature daoism to the read the first line of the
<em>Laozi</em> in a grammatically accurate way. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s
can be <em>d&agrave;o</em>-ed. They are not constant
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<h2 id="MetImp">6. Metaphysical Implications</h2>

<p>
The Metaphysics implicit in Chinese naturalism in general resembles
process philosophy (Hall and Ames 1987). <em>D&agrave;o</em> is
neither a force or a causal agent, but the structure of causal
possibility which entangles all things. As nomic d&agrave;o unfolds,
normative <em>d&agrave;o</em> emerges as natural human
<em>d&agrave;o.</em></p>

<p>
Daoists emphasize the unity of cosmic process; though it has parts,
there is one cosmic <em>d&agrave;o</em>&mdash;the <em>d&agrave;o</em>
of space-time. Humans impose object permanence on proper parts of the
cosmos. To those we assign a <em>d&agrave;o</em>, a part of cosmic
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. Cosmic process surrounds, permeates and entwines
with the processes of living things. Life <em>emerges</em> in the
cosmos; humans and their groupings emerge from a living biosphere.
Daoist norms emerge from and entangle with modally possible natural
processes.</p>

<p>
Chinese naturalism needn&rsquo;t treat our natural cognitive ability
to pick out objects from the &ldquo;blooming, buzzing confusion&rdquo;
of reality as suggesting objects are unreal. It neither equates
reality with permanence nor treats objects as combinations of
permanent components, one material the other abstract or ideal.
Objects are parts of reality with <em>d&agrave;o</em>s that are part
of <em>d&agrave;o</em>. This changes with the 2<sup>nd</sup> C
introduction of Buddhism. It introduces the rational-sensible
(emotive, impressionist) split but Buddhism itself was skeptical about
the mind-body distinction and the ego. What emerged was a more
psychologized picture. Each part had an <em>internal d&agrave;o</em>
(<em>l&#464;</em> lines, lanes) guiding its possible
<em>virtuosities</em> (<em>d&eacute;</em>) and its role in
environmental <em>d&agrave;o</em>.</p>

<p>
This analysis of Daoist metaphysics has emerged recently. Rafal Banka
(2023) draws on naturalistic theory from modern Western metaphysics,
mereology, to explain Daoist monism. Mereology is the study of
part-whole relations that is &ldquo;perfectly understood,
unproblematic, and certain&rdquo; (Lewis 1991). One version Schaffer
(Schaffer 2007) calls &ldquo;<em>priority monism</em>&rdquo;. Parts
emerge, function, and disappear in the structure of a singleton
whole.</p>

<p>
The stuff of mereology&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em>-like structures is
space-time. Things (parts of being) occupy a 4-dimensional space-time
region (Markosian 2004; Sider et al. 2008). Banka proposes to
understand Daoist commitments to <em>d&agrave;o</em> and
<em>existence</em> (&#26377; <em>y&#466;u</em> having) using
restrictions on possible compositions. At one extreme are maximal
restrictions typified by reductive atomism. The only ontological reals
are simples, particles (logical atoms, quarks) and irreducible quanta
of space-time. Humans, tables, houses, and villages are
<em>fictional</em> because they include gaps and spaces between
ultimate simples. At the opposite extreme is unrestricted composition
(UC) ignores all such gaps and treats <em>any</em> combination of
parts as a thing, so Gam Tin village plus an aerosolized particle of
Donald Trump&rsquo;s hair spray may constitute a <em>thing</em>.
Maximally restrictive mereological monism would say the only
ontological real is Shen Dao&rsquo;s <em>Great D&agrave;o.</em></p>

<p>
This allows Banka to expand on a prior hypothesis that Classical
Chinese monism is best understood as a part-whole naturalism (Hansen
1983; Robins 2000; Fraser 2007; Graham 1985). Banka&rsquo;s approach
can be expanded to relate other key concepts figuring in the
<em>Laozi&rsquo;s</em> cosmological outline: <em>terms</em> (&#21517;
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> words/names), <em>existence-non-existence</em>
(&#26377;&#28961; <em>y&#466;uw&uacute;</em> having/lacking) <em>the
cosmos</em> (&#22825;&#22320; <em>ti&#257;n-d&igrave;</em>
sky-earth:world), the <em>universe</em> (&#23431;&#23449;
<em>y&#468;zh&ograve;u</em> space-time) (Graham 1978), and the
ten-thousand <em>kinds of things</em> (&#29289; <em>w&ugrave;</em>
natural-kinds, objects, things). Where Western mereology speaks of
composition and restrictions on which compositions count as
<em>objects</em>, Daoist mereology reaches its result using
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of <em>de</em>composition, of
<em>distinction</em>s (bi&agrave;n) into parts which count as natural
object-kinds, including human social <em>things</em>.
<em>D&agrave;o</em> is the natural structure along which being unfolds
as parts emerge into <em>existence</em> along with their parts of
<em>d&agrave;o</em>.</p>

<p>
Natural kinds emerge as structural parts in an environment.
<em>Boundaries</em> (&#36783; <em>bi&agrave;n</em> distinctions)
divide the structures composed of <em>this</em> and <em>not that</em>
(&#26159;&#38750; <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> right-wrong). (The
<em>Laozi</em> avoids this Mohist vocabulary but gets the same result
focusing on opposites. The Zhuangzi, by contrast, focuses on both
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> and <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>.) The
<em>proper</em> parts of <em>existence</em> count as <em>objects</em>
or <em>things</em> insofar as we also treat them as having
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. The <em>boundaries,</em> <em>bi&agrave;n,</em>
might be vague and there may be <em>bi&agrave;n</em> that humans
cannot register, although as science develops <em>measures</em>
(<em>f&#462;</em>), we discover new things and their
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s which enable us to distinguish <em>this</em> from
<em>not-that</em>.</p>

<p>
As <em>d&agrave;o</em> unfolds in time and space, a
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of life emerges in a region. Physics structures a
region with possible <em>d&agrave;o</em>s through which various forms
of life might emerge. Life forms, following those <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
spread across the region between sky and earth. Existence is
temporally and spatially restricted; change is constant.</p>

<p>
Science studies this natural structure. Daoists were always inclined
to downplay the significance of human life in the cosmos, so its
embrace of evolution was not a revolution in thought, but was an
inspiring elaboration of their simple natural system. Given the times,
they resonated to the &ldquo;struggle for survival&rdquo; theme in
popular 19<sup>th</sup> C accounts, but the Daoist focus was always on
the environmental niche, the naturally open possibility (<em>k&#283;
d&agrave;o</em> &#21487;&#36947; permissible way) for things to
emerge&mdash;if only temporarily.</p>

<p>
The story of life is the <em>d&agrave;o</em> narrative of which the
story of humans is a part. The region of life afforded an opening, an
invitation to the animal form that is human life. We depend on an
environment of other natural kinds, from multi-cellular plants to our
nearest relatives, our prey as well as our predators. Eventually
humans emerge with their <em>l&#464;</em> and their
<em>d&eacute;,</em> making them good at exploiting the
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s in nature.</p>

<p>
This is how modern Daoists such as Yan Fu could view evolution of
species as paradigm of Daoist naturalism. The species that structure
an ecosystem structure it with <em>d&agrave;o</em>s through which
other species emerge and disappear. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s change. It is
popular, but not necessary, to portray this as a Chinese organic model
of the entire natural universe. The core Daoist structure of ways,
capacities to follow them in unfolding behavior, however, does not
require thinking of minerals and atoms as alive. Collections of things
are also things with collective <em>d&agrave;os.</em> There are
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of families, prefectures, linguistic regions,
states, all species and of life itself.</p>

<p>
A modern Daoist, Jin Yuelin, argues explicitly for this kind of
picture. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s for things are opportunities or
possibilities created by the structure of all the other parts of being
in larger and larger wholes. His &ldquo;<em>d&agrave;o-</em>one&rdquo;
is the <em>improper</em> part that is identical with that whole and
<em>d&agrave;o-</em>infinite are all the proper parts. They form the
structures of possibility for all the proper parts of
<em>existence</em> (<em>y&#466;u</em>). The myriad
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s for parts of <em>existence</em> are parts of
<em>d&agrave;o-</em>one. There is no external structure, nothing
outside of <em>d&agrave;o one.</em></p>

<p>
The picture is also Guo Xiang&rsquo;s, and copied in Buddhist
terminology in Hua Yan Buddhism. Ziporyn proffers a way to fold
traditional oxymorons into this &ldquo;unproblematic&rdquo; natural
d&agrave;o. Let&rsquo;s understand <em>l&#464;</em> (<em>internal</em>
<em>lanes</em>) as materially &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; (Ziporyn 2012)
with <em>d&agrave;o</em> on analogy to gear systems or to wave
coherence. Given the convention of using <em>l&#464;</em> to translate
Western Rationalist terms like &lsquo;reason&rsquo;,
&lsquo;principle&rsquo;, and &lsquo;theory,&rsquo; we can explicate
the sense in which &ldquo;boundless&rdquo; <em>d&agrave;o</em> (Walker
2019) cannot be understood rationally. It means Jin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<em>d&agrave;o</em>-one&rdquo; has no <em>l&#464;</em> of its
own. Its <em>l&#464;</em> is the sum of the <em>l&#464;</em>s of all
its parts. Science can theorize about its parts as adapting to their
context. D&agrave;o-one has no context, so it follows the
<em>self-realization</em> (&#33258;&#28982;
<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> natural) of all its parts (Laozi Ch.
25).</p>

<p>
Our moderately permissive restriction on Daoist mereological
decomposition simplifies folding the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of living
things, animals, humans, priests and philosophers into natural
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. Natural and <em>human</em> (social) kinds are
parts with their respective natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Chinese
count <em>horse</em> and <em>ox</em> among <em>things</em> (&#29289;
<em>w&ugrave;</em>). Both evolved into inviting environmental niches
(<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) that emerged with the unfolding of
<em>natural</em> (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) <em>d&agrave;o.</em> Likewise,
humanity and all its social groupings. As parts of humanity, their
social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s constitute part of the d&agrave;o of human
life.</p>

<p>
Socially constructed things, e.g., forks, chopsticks, and sake cups
have both social and natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. They would not
exist without the social practices in which they are
<em>implements</em> (&#22120; <em>q&igrave;</em> tools, weapons) but
they still follow natural daos, e.g., of gravity. <em>Interactive
behaviors</em> (&#20107; <em>sh&igrave;</em> affairs) like paying a
bill, marriage, and winning at chess are parts of a social structure
that affords numerous ways of performing <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. A
thing&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em> is <em>how</em> it emerges,
<em>how</em> sustained until <em>some-how</em> (like foot-binding) it
disappears.</p>

<p>
The possibility map of the cosmos changes as each thing, each proper
part, <em>realizes</em> one of its possibilities and leaves others
unrealized. Jin&rsquo;s naturalistic conception of <em>d&agrave;o</em>
includes <em>facts</em> among the things with a <em>human</em>
component (Chen 2019). They are not &ldquo;socially constructed&rdquo;
in the sense that human conceptions control the unfolding of natural
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. The unfolding happens, then human measurement and
syntactic structure makes knowing about it <em>generally</em>
accessible in the form of theory, laws and logic. Daoism rejects
fatalism (Zhuangzi 33:4) but is non-committal on determinism and no
theory of free-will. We build our capabilities with learning and
practice and, though there surely are things that are beyond us,
usually we can do things better.</p>

<p>
Human &ldquo;facts&rdquo; are not the sentences of any particular
historical linguistic community, particularly not of the scientific
community since its <em>d&agrave;o</em> is one of denying that kind of
authority. That even flawless application of its method may fail to
discern truth is the key to its <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>
self-correction and echoes the <em>Zhuangzi</em> (2:12) on humanist
methods. Mozi&rsquo;s advocacy of relying on <em>f&#462;</em>
(measurement standards) hints at the key to this
&ldquo;Quasi-objectivity&rdquo; (Gibbard 1990). We can learn and know
how to use devices to query nature about a distinction or
discrimination assuring consistency across linguistic communities.</p>

<p>
Although training can increase accuracy in the use of measurement
devices, most humans can operate them to arrive at <em>nearly</em>
<em>the same</em> answer. We accept the norms of science even as
working scientists treat them as hypotheses. Scientific consensus
makes the concept of <em>human</em> facts useful in a broadly
cooperative system of collecting, preserving, and accessing
information about the structure of <em>natural d&agrave;o</em>.
Knowing this structure can make us aware of d&agrave;os we did not
know and give us <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of teaching, learning and
practicing how to navigate them. Modern Daoist naturalists&rsquo;
embrace of science is choosing a far-better human <em>d&agrave;o</em>
for this purpose than traditional (e.g., Yin-Yang) theory.</p>

<h2 id="ImpForNorLin">7. Implications for Normative Linguistics</h2>

<p>
Daoist metaphysics informs its theory of language. The second line of
the <em>Laozi</em> parallels the first: &ldquo;names can be named;
they are not constant names.&rdquo; From that to Yan Fu and Jin
Yuelin&rsquo;s embrace of Western logic and science, Daoist have seen
language as evolving, not fixed. That attitude was implicit in the
Classical view of language as part of human <em>d&agrave;o.</em> In
outline, it resembled the direct-reference, conventional-historical
view that Plato rejects in the <em>Cratylus</em> while motivating his
<em>idea</em> theory. Saul Kripke revived it as the &ldquo;modern
theory of reference&rdquo; (Kripke 1980). In the Confucian version the
&ldquo;coiners&rdquo; were ancient sages. They created names for
things. Confucians the names and the social practice roles figured
centrally in Confucian social practices, <em>rituals</em> (&#31150;
<em>l&#464;</em> <sup>ceremony</sup>, decorum, manners) which also
derived from those sages.</p>

<p>
The implicit norms of language, the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of using
words, was to emulate one&rsquo;s teacher. Learning was the link in a
causal chain of use from the sage coiners. The teachers&rsquo;
<em>d&agrave;o</em> was to accurately model the <em>way</em> they
learned to use the word to students. The norm of fidelity, respect for
tradition, elders and teachers flowed with this normative theory of
naming. Language was a paradigm of social practices. The crucial step
to philosophy was Mozi&rsquo;s argument that we can improve
conventions, including language. His initial proposal was a crude form
of language utilitarianism (Hansen 1989), the more carful formulation
of his students incorporated the &ldquo;utility&rdquo; of consistency
with the past and of measurement.</p>

<p>
The early, primitivist, phase of Daoism rejected language: Shen Dao,
on the basis of his extreme Monist metaphysics, rejecting all
distinctions, Laozi, on the basis that socially constructed
<em>things</em> create artificial desires for those things, e.g.,
money and status. Competition for these leads to disputes and war
(Hansen 1992). This early quietism generated the paradox highlighted
by these later Mohists (Canon II:172).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi refined the mature Daoist position, noting that like other
tools with social uses, coordinating behavior with sounds, signaling
was natural; the real issue between the humanists was which of the
plethora of possible natural human languages to use in coordinating a
scheme of <em>rituals&mdash;</em>social behaviors.</p>

<p>
However, Zhuangzi saw Mozi&rsquo;s proposal as leading to an impasse.
A measurement might give us greater objectivity in determining how
much <em>utility</em> (&#21033; <em>l&igrave;</em> benefit, yield) but
could not determine if <em>utility</em> was the only relevant measure.
The Confucians reacted by rejecting use of the term and appealing
directly to <em>morality</em> (<em>y&igrave;</em>). Given one
consequence of the Mohist proposal, skimping on funeral expenses for
one&rsquo;s parents, Confucians concluded measuring utility was
<em>immoral.</em></p>

<p>
Further, any measurement would presuppose an interpretation of
<em>utility&mdash;</em>including the value of music and dance or only
basic goods. The way of solving both impasses seemed to require an
embedding of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s in a hierarchy. There must be
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of choosing and interpreting
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. The complexity of the project of reforming
language and other social norms made him skeptical that anyone knew
how to complete it&mdash;including himself.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s implicit meta-<em>d&agrave;o</em> was natural
evolution with all users adapting their usage from their perspective
and in their situation. Language, he argued, was ultimately grounded
in user-relative terms like <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>. A choice
of <em>this</em> and <em>not that</em> was a designation, initiating a
use. &ldquo;Language is not mere exhaling. Language says something,
but what it says is never fixed&rdquo; (Zhuangzi 2:4).</p>

<p>
Shen Dao&rsquo;s prescriptive eschewing of <em>this</em> and
<em>not-that</em> usage and <em>Laozi</em>&rsquo;s normative
&ldquo;w&uacute;-w&eacute;i&rdquo; slogan were not only paradoxical,
but they were also baldly unnatural for creatures like us. However,
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s mature Daoism could share in de-sanctifying
conventional usage and could embrace liberation from conventional
arrangements that no longer fit our situation while still recognizing
that cooperation is beneficial. Our situation and perspectives include
the established arrangements.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi avoided early Daoism&rsquo;s over-correction. Mozi&rsquo;s
reformed social structure was neither more nor less <em>natural</em>
(<em>ti&#257;n</em>) than Confucian tradition. It was another
<em>natural</em> possibility. A new part of <em>d&agrave;o</em>
emerges for us when we construct a linguistic community&mdash;a part
of natural possibility (<em>D&agrave;o</em>) we <em>naturally</em>
(<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n self-realize</em>) construct.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi, rather than drawing the no-social-<em>d&agrave;o</em>
conclusion, revels in the freedom afforded by the plethora of
different constructable human ways. The range of possibilities and the
attractiveness of various alternatives is a function of our current
trajectory and position along a previously chosen social
<em>d&agrave;o.</em> The <em>self</em> in <em>self-realize</em> is a
perspectival self, not a substantive one. Any part of humanity, a
person, family, village, culture, or species is somewhere on a
trajectory along a path choosing its next branch. Linguistic
communities are on a branching path of possibilities shaped by its
current <em>walking</em> (&#34892; <em>x&iacute;ng</em> behavior)
along a path of possibility it committed to in the past. The further
choices are branches off this path.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi thus accepts the value of conforming to the
&ldquo;usual&rdquo; language <em>here-now</em> while pointedly
withholding the judgment it <em>simply</em> is correct (Zhuangzi 2:8).
His <em>this-</em>ness is indexed&mdash;it is the better choice
<em>here, now, for us.</em> Our choices are from here, now, given our
current behavioral motivations, commitments and capacities. Still,
many choices remain--neither none nor one. There is one probability
map of the universe, but it maps uncountably many possibilities for
many proper parts.</p>

<p>
Natural paths are information structures in the natural environment
that living things can find and follow. There is a gradation, but not
a strict dualism, between those that are and are not learned, that are
and are not conventional. We make physical paths, Zhuangzi points out,
by walking them (practice). Social paths are entangled with the social
practice of language norms and these information structures provide us
with guidance that we can use in navigating our lives.</p>

<p>
Conventional linguistic guidance as such need not impair our capacity
to read and execute non-linguistic natural ways. It might be if the
formulae are rather less <em>permissive</em> (&#21487; k&#283;
assertible, possible). That would occur, for example, when we limit
color distinctions to the conventional list of five colors
(<em>Laozi</em> 12). A scheme of eight or twelve colors is a better
possibility than one with a mere five. The essence of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
correction is that rather than rejecting <em>all color schemes</em> we
consider increasingly flexible ones. Appreciating the multiplicity of
possible human conceptual schemes means learning any one is compatible
with wanting to improve it, to amplify rather than regiment our
natural capacity to distinguish the parts of reality relevant for
sharing guiding information with each other.</p>

<p>
Humans are distinctive in our capacity to evolve and shape our
different norms of communication. Notoriously, other animals
communicate. Their communicative capacities are more limited in
structure and use than in humans. Bees&rsquo; waggle-dance can guide
the hive to food or nesting sites, but their &ldquo;language&rdquo; is
relatively &ldquo;hard-wired.&rdquo; Neither they nor ants are free to
innovate, teach and learn new communicative norms. Human language
ability equips us to treat our language (our names) as themselves
objects of choice. Daoism is not committed to an ideal language but
remains open to revising language and adapting it to facilitate
natural guidance&mdash;"<em>d&agrave;o</em>s can be
<em>d&agrave;o</em>ed and names can be named&rdquo; (<em>Laozi</em>
1:2).</p>

<p>
While the classical Chinese conception of a community&rsquo;s language
included a counterpart of reference/denotation, it functioned more
explicitly in the context of learning and knowing-<em>d&agrave;o</em>
than in believing or knowing-that. A sign, a name, can help us
identify a path, but guidance comes from the path. &ldquo;Keep
left&rdquo; as an instruction only gives guidance <em>relative to an
external path</em> which may branch both ways. In this way,
knowing-<em>d&agrave;o</em> is unlike linguistic commands (rules, laws
or principles). It doesn&rsquo;t immediately enmesh us in the logic of
syntactical relations between a law and a fact&mdash;an event or
action. Reference in the Chinese philosophical context was the
knowing-of part of knowing-how. Even Mozi&rsquo;s use of measurement
in knowing-of a thing involved knowing-how to use the measurement
tool. Knowing-of (e.g., by naming) triggers a behavior and helps
orient that behavior.</p>

<p>
Until Buddhism arrived knowing language did not involve mental
intermediates such as ideas, meanings, intensions, or other mental
language symbols. We learn using the capacity to recognize a shape in
either a written Chinese character, a picture, and reality. We learn
it by following the model and speech behavior of others in the
community.</p>

<p>
The Daoist open-minded attitude toward evolving languages emerged in
its openness to exploring the first import of a &ldquo;Western&rdquo;
spectator and container metaphor of mind. Buddhist
&ldquo;mind-only&rdquo; idealism made information come only the form
of sense data and concluded that the <em>apparent</em> structure of
the real-world possibilities embodied by learning and practice was an
illusion. Buddhists concluded we should renounce language and
life.</p>

<p>
A smorgasbord of paradoxes accompanied this <em>nothingness</em>
(Nirvana) goal. The paradigm was the paradox of desire&mdash;the
desire for Nirvana prevents us from achieving it. Laozi&rsquo;s
insight paved a way to escape the paradox. The desire for Nirvana
comes with Buddhist metaphysical language, learning the contrasting
pair, Nirvana/Samsara (the cycle of reincarnation). Forgetting the
terms, the distinctions and Buddhist metaphysics enables us to cease
desiring Nirvana and return to life&mdash;&ldquo;carrying water and
chopping wood.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much to Buddhist
teaching!&rdquo; (Feng and Bodde 1937)</p>

<p>
The Zen (&#31146; <em>Chan</em>) result blended Buddhism with Daoism
and limited the no-language, empty mind to exercises of highly skilled
practitioners of various arts whose focus is on the way rather than
the concepts used in acquiring it (Zhuangzi 3:1). Buddhism introduced
syntactic concepts which repurposed <em>l&#464;</em> (lanes) as
<em>principles</em> and <em>authentic</em> (&#30495;
<em>zh&#275;n</em> natural as opposed to artificial, social) as
<em>truth.</em> It included an epistemic version of Greek syllogism
but, purposed to motivate Buddhist anti-realism, remained a niche
concern. Ditto for Jesuit 17<sup>th</sup> C. syllogistic logic which
Chinese intellectuals viewed as verbal sophistry to spread their
religion of a ruler of <em>sky-nature</em> (&#22825;&#20027;
ti&#257;nzh&#468; Catholic God)&mdash;akin to Classical sophistries
such as &ldquo;White horse not horse.&rdquo; When logic came packaged
with a naturalist <em>d&agrave;o</em> of evolutionary change (and
western military might) in the 19<sup>th</sup> C, Yan Fu&rsquo;s
enthusiasm for it was contagious.</p>

<p>
Sentence syntax and logical form were clearly parts of the
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of language use, ergo of human
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. This was especially true of quasi-objective
measurement-based descriptions which all human languages can express
and from which we can derive agreed logical conclusions. Jin
Yuelin&rsquo;s Daoist treatment of Russell&rsquo;s logical positivism
departed mainly on this point. Facts (true declarative sentences) are
real human things. However, the world consists of its thing-parts and
their <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Facts, like other human tools, have both
natural and human <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Our measuring tools are human
things, but they are ways of letting <em>nature</em> judge and thus
produce quasi-objective results across diverse human groups.</p>

<p>
The norms of scientific language emerged as the intersection of
skilled use of tools of measurement and information in a structure
that invites similarly <em>reliable</em> logical and mathematical
processing. This makes the information recorded as <em>facts</em>
available in compressed axiom format and removes reliance on
performative authority. Efficient storage and easy access support
cooperative accumulation of information. Compared to known
alternatives, the social <em>d&agrave;o</em> with the language-use
norms of modern science is a preferrable <em>d&agrave;o</em> of
constructing a system of sharing information among humans. This left
Jin able to affirm a correspondence theory of truth relating
propositions to <em>facts.</em></p>

<p>
Some modern logicians have associated Daoism with paraconsistent
logic. Graham Priest et. al. motivate this as allowing the
paradoxical, anti-language formulations in Daoism and Buddhism
(Deguchi et al. 2021; Priest and Garfield 2021). Koji Tanaka, however,
is more consistent with mature Daoism&rsquo;s naturalism and promotion
of scientific method. Sometimes our best way to collect, process and
use information may involve using two theories that technically are in
contradiction, e.g., relativity and quantum mechanics. Paraconsistent
logics allows us to hold both that the contradiction is false without
trivially &ldquo;exploding&rdquo; logic&mdash;allowing us to prove any
absurdity. We can leave the contradiction in place and go on gathering
and processing information about the natural world. We rule out only
using the contradiction in further logical inference (Tanaka
2004).</p>

<p>
Our lives are limited; knowledge (natural guidance) is unlimited. To
pursue the unlimited with the limited is dangerous (Zhuangzi 3:1).</p>

<h2 id="ImpForEpi">8. Implications for Epistemology</h2>

<p>
The <em>d&agrave;o</em> metaphor shaped Classical Chinese conceptions
of knowing as pragmatic. The Confucian model of master-disciple
training emphasized learning as increasing one&rsquo;s virtuosity at
some skilled real-world behavior. It did not pivot around the
West&rsquo;s knowledge versus belief dichotomy. The empirical
component was not sense-data, but practice. Experience was
&ldquo;undergoing&rdquo; not an inner movie. The senses and internal
states were involved, but the whole body knows how to walk a path.</p>

<p>
When we learn to do something, information stored in natural branching
path-like structures&mdash;<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of
possibility&mdash;guides us. Our social histories construct paths of
permissibility by which we find, choose, and follow natural paths.
Intertwined with these are daos of sharing path relevant information.
All of these, including the permissible use of words and structured
strings turns on a learning amplified natural ability to distinguish X
from not-X. The classical version of a simple &ldquo;belief&rdquo;
grammatically resembled English <em>de re</em> beliefs. We recognize
an indexical <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> as X or not-X. Daoist
epistemology focused on the social categories available and the ways
we knew to invoke them in processing and sharing practical
information. A &ldquo;belief&rdquo; consists of assigning a
<em>term</em> (&#21517; <em>m&iacute;ng</em> name) to some
contextually distinguishable object.</p>

<p>
This blended with overall topic-comment larger structure of Classical
Chinese in which the expression of the subject term was optional in
either indicative or prescriptive voice. And we intuitively read
reference to another&rsquo;s propositional knowledge as
possessive&mdash;he knows the horse&rsquo;s quick(ness). So, the range
of issues that would generate belief-knowledge discussions became
matters of mastery of the social norms of category distinction,
recognition, and communication.</p>

<p>
<em>De re</em> belief could be wrong either because the person used
the word incorrectly or failed to perceive the distinction between X
and not-X. The social <em>d&agrave;o</em> normative orientation
continues to shape epistemological discussion until the import of
Buddhism. The focus of skepticism was on <em>both</em> cultural and
indexical relativity. We change our social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as we
apply them in different situations, from different perspectives. The
perspectives include the type and quality of training and practice in
following a social <em>d&agrave;o</em>. It ties individual
subjectivity to a physical history of how we arrived here now facing
<em>this</em> branch in our <em>d&agrave;o,</em> not to an
ego-self.</p>

<p>
So rather than true vs. false claims, beliefs, assertions, statements
etc., Daoist epistemology deals with <em>this not-that</em> and
<em>permissible</em> or <em>not judgments</em> of courses of behavior,
including speech behaviors (assertible or not). The Daoist suspicion
of social practices is more central than worries about illusion. It
lurks behind the early skepticism that all word use is bad and the
mature Daoist celebration of the plethora of natural linguistic
possibilities. Mature Daoist skepticism derives from the practical
impossibility of surveying all and the suspicion that some of the
choices may be multiply decidable. Perfection is beyond our natural
reach. Some can be <em>de re</em> classed as <em>better</em> than
others following available <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of evaluation. This
open-ended recursion is a behavior we routinely engage in but our
&ldquo;lives are limited; and knowing-how is unlimited.&rdquo;
(Zhuangzi 3:1)</p>

<p>
Mature Daoism is also skeptical that we can draw any precise
distinction between human and natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Confucians
treat father-son and ruler-minister as equally natural human
relationship structures. Daoists are less enamored of ruler-minister
arrangements. Buddhists treat dreaming and being awake as
indistinguishable. Daoists would treat that as a natural distinction
(e.g., widely shared among diurnal animals) and accept that sometimes
we sleep and dream that we are dreaming and awake sometimes wonder if
we are. There are still normally straightforward ways of discerning if
we are asleep or awake, except for hyper-phantastic dreamers. But
learning (internal practice) can go on in dreams or in imagination and
planning.</p>

<p>
Dreaming plays a different role in Daoist epistemology. It becomes a
metaphor for how our changing point of view can get better as our
knowledge progresses (Zhuangzi 2:12). &ldquo;Waking up&rdquo; is
seeing from a new perspective. We do not have a subjective inner world
whose structure we project on reality; it is &ldquo;out there.&rdquo;
Zhang Dongsun, the premier Chinese student of Western epistemology
treated this as the key difference between Chinese and Western
metaphysical outlooks (Ro&scaron;ker 2012). The <em>d&agrave;o</em>
possibility structure might be beyond our full understanding, but we
are part of it, emerged from it and reflect one of its
possibilities&mdash;the emergence of <em>knowing</em> creatures. Jin
Yuelin similarly argued that the classic problem of induction requires
assuming a metaphysical <em>order</em> and our inner
<em>coherence</em> with it (Zinda 2012). This surprising
epistemological role for dreaming results from the focus on a shared
human discourse <em>d&agrave;o</em> (Hansen 1992). We know how to
find, choose and follow some natural and most human, ways.</p>

<p>
Otherwise, Daoist epistemology of the senses resembles na&iuml;ve
realism (aka neutral monism). We see, hear, feel, taste, smell, and
experience the distinctions that are in the natural world. Our senses
can make some, but not all the distinctions that mark natural kinds
and things with natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Our human social
practice of science enables us to use tools to measure others.
&ldquo;Experience&rdquo; remains whole-body practice of learned skills
(know-hows), realized in the context of natural paths of opportunity
(<em>d&agrave;o</em>s), <em>realized from here</em> (&#33258;&#28982;
<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>). Our knowledge can always improve and
increase as we broaden our range of perspectives (Sturgeon 2015). We
needn&rsquo;t assume a perfect perspective from
nowhere/everywhere.</p>

<p>
Social implements, like <em>words</em> and language, exist relative to
both natural and social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. A knife is a knife
because some natural being has a practice of cutting, but it is also a
physical object following natures <em>d&agrave;o</em> of inertia. A
socially relative behavior such as buying a sandwich uses paper,
metals, or electronic paths that follow natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>.
Science is a pan-human social <em>d&agrave;o</em> of gathering,
storing, arranging, sharing and accessing information about both the
natural and social worlds. In science, we arrange these in syntactic
sentential and argument forms, axiomatic theory structures. Daoism
implicitly conforms to Lewis&rsquo;s ability hypothesis about knowing
propositions (Lewis 1988). Large scale scientific narratives such as
evolution, inflation and multi-verse theory are <em>d&agrave;o</em>s,
historical narratives of us and other species. The information about
our bodies and environment informs our social and individual programs
for the entire range of recognized performances, from music to sports
and philosophical ethics.</p>

<p>
As Tanaka argued (Tanaka 2004), we cannot be sure our logical and
mathematical language practices for these descriptive purposes are
complete and consistent. Daoists are not idealist rationalists and do
not have a religious faith in these methods. Daoism is naturalism, not
scientism. The philosophical Daoist project is not oxymoronic, but
neither is it exploded by discovering paradoxes in our human
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of learning about nature&rsquo;s
<em>d&agrave;o</em>.</p>

<p>
The Daoist text is nature and we <em>read</em> nature in the language
of logic, measurement, and mathematics, the language of science. Human
construction is only one of the ways nature constructs new
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s (i.e., new <em>d&agrave;o</em>s emerge). Large
animals create paths to water and grazing areas and water itself
creates <em>d&agrave;o</em>s which humans and fish, bears etc. may
follow. With humans, at least, one emergent guiding path is morality.
It emerges from the recursive complexity of the path-metaphor of
guidance, ways of finding, choosing, and interpreting
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s leads to a shared human conception of the limit
of a human inductive process of finding natural guidance.</p>

<p>
Humans navigate in <em>d&agrave;o</em> as fish navigate in water
(Zhuangzi 6:6).</p>

Daoism, as a version of metaethical naturalism associated with
skeptical-relativist attitudes about social mores grounds these
<em>normative</em> accounts of metaphysics, linguistics, and
epistemology. Norms (<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) are everywhere. Their
skeptical relativist metaethics inhibited Daoists from spelling out a
normative theory of first-order social-mores. This perceived absence
led Neo-Confucians to accuse Daoism (and its Zen Buddhist alter-ego)
of being amoral.</p>

<p>
Confucians also try to defuse Daoism&rsquo;s critical stance by
interpreting it as a rival first order scheme of social-political
mores, like their own&mdash;relying sage authority and
<em>cultivated</em> intuitionism but offering &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;
(&#28961;&#28858; <em>w&uacute;w&egrave;i</em> non-action) as
guidance. Here we traced Daoism critique of the moral
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> (&#36783; disagreement) impasse between
Confucianism and Mohism. Like them, Daoism&rsquo;s moral focus would
indeed be on social mores (including norms of language use) rather
than God&rsquo;s/Reason&rsquo;s commands to individuals (Rosemont
2015). Despite the differences in the concepts, <em>morality</em>
(&#32681; <em>y&igrave;</em> duty, righteousness) shares the sense of
being the same for many perspectives since all parties to the classic
dispute agreed when rival system of mores clash, both cannot be
right.</p>

<p>
The norms of language use become a paradigm case of how to settle such
normative issues. The Later Mohists had proposed &ldquo;making
constant language which promoted <em>good behavior</em> (&#34892;
<em>x&iacute;ng</em> walk, conduct)&rdquo; (Mozi 11:3:11). The Daoists
might endorse the broad spirit of that formula as the account of moral
discourse <em>d&agrave;o</em>, the correct way to talk about different
systems of social mores.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good behavior,&rdquo; unfortunately is the crux of the matter.
We can judge this as moral or immoral from outside the
community&rsquo;s system. From inside, the issue is the
<em>virtuosity</em> of <em>realizing this</em> local human
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. When we know of an alternative moral
<em>d&agrave;o</em>, it creates a choice of which to follow from
<em>here, now.</em> Knowing from more perspectives improves our
chances of choosing wisely. Choosing is natural when both accept the
quasi-objective norm: our perspective is no more naturally
authoritative than theirs (Zhuangzi 2:4). If their norms recognize
their own natural fallibility, then a way of walking two
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s emerges (Zhuangzi 2:6). Each part
<em>realizes</em> one of its possible paths forward. The natural way
emerges from that permissive realization allowing the communities to
walk together. Being in accord with another is being in accord with
nature. <em>Natural</em> (&#22825; <em>ti&#257;n</em>)
<em>d&agrave;o</em> models itself on <em>self-realization</em>
(&#33258;&#28982; <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> natural, spontaneous)
(Laozi 25).</p>

<p>
The <em>Ru-Mo</em> (Confucian-Mohist) impasse resulted from their
rival meta<em>d&agrave;os</em> for choosing, reforming, and
practically interpreting social mores&mdash;scholar authority vs
utility calculus. Daoism implicitly changed both
meta-<em>d&agrave;o</em>s from required to permitted. There is no
authority on morality (Mohists implicitly accepted this
anti-authoritarian view. see (Hansen 2011)) and universal
utilitarianism is too burdensome (Zhuangzi 33:2). Whatever morality
is, it must incorporate my role in my profession, my community, my
family and my own healthy living. If each community&rsquo;s mores
include what permissible moralities permit, we can slowly adapt norms
to preserve some commitments while reforming others. Permissible
systems normatively accept this is self-correcting when in contact
with others. Thus, each becomes capable of evolution. We cannot
exclude the intuition cultivated in past practice, but it cannot be
what settles the matter.</p>

<p>
At the same time, Zhuangzi accepts that the current local social mores
are useful. They facilitate communication and cooperation. And while
that is good, it is not the end of the matter (Zhuangzi 2:6).
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s epistemology reflects the anti-authoritarian and
anti-intuition posture and the endless possibility of
improvement&mdash;a conception of morality that transcends present
social practice but not the evolutionary processes of nature.</p>

<p>
Cultural and religious evolution are natural. We can and do judge
other cultures (Mozi 6:12). Early Westerners experienced China as
highly moral in behavior but lacking their deontic concept of
<em>morality</em>. Their conception of the concept superficially had
<em>nature</em> playing the God&rsquo;s-eye view role, but
nature&rsquo;s way of unfolding lets each part play its own role,
<em>self-realizing</em> (&#33258;&#28982; <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>
natural, spontaneous) its evolving re-construction. Daoists do accept
the scientific community as an <em>expert</em> authority. Science does
not choose <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, does not tell nature how to unfold
but expertly tracks the process of change. Science gives us
information that counts for or against our <em>self-realizing</em>
choices.</p>

<p>
Science does not make our perspectival choices but tells us the things
we need to know to distinguish <em>permissible</em> (&#21487; k&#283;)
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Sky-n<em>ature</em> (&#22825;
<em>ti&#257;n</em>) itself is also normatively neutral.
<em>Ti&#257;n</em>&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em> is just the structure
of natural possibility. It does not speak, ergo does not command. It
is a fantasy of the Western version that morality is about such
commands. The question is not &ldquo;Who says?&rdquo; but
&ldquo;where, when, and how to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Neo-Confucians project amoralism onto Daoist epistemic modesty, its
rejection of authority <em>and</em> intuition (Zhuangzi 2:3&ndash;4,
12). The failure of Daoism to formulate a first-order normative
<em>d&agrave;o</em> does not entail that moral <em>d&agrave;o</em> was
<em>mystical</em>, unspeakable, or paradoxically unteachable.</p>

<p>
The metaethics of Daoism make the possibility of naturally correct
first-order moral guidance the default. It does not purport to label
it as <em>permissible</em> from the perspective of the cosmos. Moral
permissibility emerges from the sense that our moral culture can make
progress in performance while broadening our perspective toward a
limit. The moral path for each would converge, progressively improving
this structure of linguistic and social mores. The complex, recursive
nature of <em>d&agrave;o</em> choice helps us recognize moral progress
without assuming an absolute final morality. It&rsquo;s an open-minded
and open-ended process of finding, choosing and executing
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of finding, choosing and executing
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. While there may be a single point of
convergence, pluralism is more likely (Wong 2006).</p>

<p>
The conventional formula &ldquo;harmony with nature&rdquo; makes some
sense as harmony with other parts of the natural world of living
things. We obviously have little issue about the morality of the earth
continuing on its evolving path in our solar system, galaxy, and the
ultimate fate of the big-bang universe. In the relevant realm
&ldquo;under heaven,&rdquo; the proper parts of which we are proper
parts embrace many &ldquo;life forms.&rdquo; Daoism departs from the
Ru-Mo pattern of limiting moral concern to &ldquo;humans.&rdquo; While
the classical masters knew nothing about global warming, moral concern
for the environment is clearly consonant with its naturalism.
Normative path structures emerge as all the different natural
perspectives we occupy, not merely that of the individual reasoner. My
best path here now is finishing this sentence. It&rsquo;s best for
life on earth if humanity limits global warming. Both, and many
in-between, are perspectives I juggle during a regular
day&mdash;writing and sorting the recycling and compost. In between
are my roles in my extended family, my school, state, etc.</p>

<p>
In each case, Daoists take Zhuangzi&rsquo;s perspective. We act on
<em>and adapt</em> existing shared practices (mores) guiding our/this
part&rsquo;s decision making and interpretation. Harmony with nature
is harmony with other parts of each structure in which I participate.
I choose paths using the complex recursive meta-daos from each and all
of these things with which I identify, the parts of which I am part,
and as that converges on a final, best overall choice and
interpretation is the moral <em>d&agrave;o</em> for me here now.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Empty your mind&rdquo; gives us permission to seek tranquility
while behaving in &ldquo;harmony with
 nature.<a name="b"></a>&rdquo;
 Like the adaptations acquired in evolution, our human problem-solving
heuristics take reasonable account of the limitations of time and
energy. With learning and practice, morality comes to seem natural
(<em>Analects</em> 2:4). We see adapting and perfecting them as
continued honing of practices, including norms of language use in the
flow of this life (Zen).</p>

<h2 id="NorMorThe">10. Normative Moral Theory</h2>

<p>
Besides environmental ethics, Daoist metaethics has fueled debate
about other implications for any first-order morality to count as
Daoist. Early and mature differ on whether it is teachable. They agree
on learning from nature, but Zhuangzi accepts learning and
participating in human <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as well. He also
recommends improving moral performance by learning from others&rsquo;
practices. Practice with a social <em>d&agrave;o</em> may produce a
dissonance and trigger looking for ways to reform or it may confirm
and stabilize the commitment (Zhuangzi 20:4). For the possibility of
this self-realized progress, it should encourage both curiosity and
open-mindedness. Clearly, knowledge of the mores of other moral
communities will enlarge the size of conceivable paths to inform our
incremental reform. Mozi had to invent his (<em>Mozi</em> 6C:12).</p>

<p>
The general Daoist norm is openness to change and progress. Both
outcomes <em>emerge</em> (&#20986; <em>ch&#363;</em> send out,
produce, bear) naturally and communities assign them to a normative
category. The Daoist prefers the naming norms of more and larger
community perspectives. Morality evolves as does language use, by many
individual choices of ways of performing an evolving community&rsquo;s
<em>d&agrave;o</em>.</p>

<p>
The whiff of relativism here invites a frequent normative challenge.
The accusation is that since paradigms of social orders now <em>known
to be wrong</em> emerged naturally, e.g., Hitler-Nazi or Southern
slave owner mores, what does Daoist natural relativism say of them?
Confucians used despotic mores such as those of the Qin
&ldquo;Legalist&rdquo; regime in their version of this accusation (Van
Norden 2016).</p>

<p>
Natural evolutionary relativism would see such historical paradigms as
instructive. The accusation contains this implicit key, we have
naturally <em>come to know</em> they are wrong and epistemic modesty
would have deterred enthusiastic participation. Insofar as
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s <em>permission</em> to use the existing norms goes,
learning from the perspective of the oppressed motivates the
Schindler&rsquo;s and Huck Finn&rsquo;s who <em>interpreted</em> the
norms in ways to aid the victims of those cruel social mores. That the
mores emerged naturally&mdash;and are <em>ours</em>, <em>here</em>,
<em>now</em>&mdash;does not count in favor of stasis. They remind us
that, despite Ru-Mo visions of single-<em>d&agrave;o</em> societies,
most social norm systems have their internal controversies and
open-minded engagement with its critics and victims is clearly
consonant with the program of mature Daoism.</p>

<p>
Most important, these examples remind us to be alert to
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s in our own time that might lead to such regimes
emerging again (with different symbols, leaders and dogmas). Rejecting
&ldquo;great man&rdquo; authoritarianism sits centrally in the
definition of the Daoist vs. Ru-Mo divide. Social mores, though
useful, are most likely flawed. We temper our <em>useful</em>
conformity with readiness to see the flaws while still avoiding free
riding on others&rsquo; cooperative self-restraint. The cooperative
goals, however, cannot be capriciously hostile to other perspectives
and a modest skeptical realism might hasten the peaceful evolution to
a better system of social mores&mdash;without resort to world or civil
war.</p>

<p>
Daoism, like most of the classical schools, was opposed to both war
and punishment. It is notorious as the most egalitarian, least
authoritarian and most creative and liberating of China&rsquo;s
ancient schools. Daoist, &ldquo;wandering without a fixed
destination,&rdquo; does not rule out choosing the better of known
mores and <em>mature</em> Daoism openly encourages curiosity about and
communication with other <em>ways of life.</em> Its meta-ethics is
<em>skeptical</em> relativism in that there <em>may</em> be a common
outcome for progressively evolving first-order moral conceptions.
However, it accepts that relative improvements converging toward
multiple moralities is also possible.</p>

<p>
Daoist perspectival relativism is a consequence of its commitment to
natural normative guidance, not a premise of its conception of
morality. It is skeptical of authority particularly that of this past
tradition (Confucianism) and of imperial moralities make morality
incompatible with full and contented life including aesthetic and
intellectual <em>joys.</em> It was not alone in opposing punishment.
Confucius&rsquo; argument (<em>Analects</em> 2:3) set the tone. It
departed from Ru-Mo mainly in opposing the quest for a single system
of mores. Laozi&rsquo;s famous <em>laissez faire</em> conception of
the ideal ruler and Zhuangzi&rsquo;s refusal to accept high office was
implicit acknowledgement that we could find ways to live in peace
while tolerating many ways of life.</p>

<p>
The disastrous Qin (221&ndash;206 <small>BC</small>) experiment
translated as &ldquo;legalism&rdquo; was an enthusiastic use of
punishment. Its theorists paradoxically argued that rigidly
<em>measured</em> punishment would eliminate punishment. They borrowed
Mozi&rsquo;s quasi-objective concept of measurement and Shang Yang
argued that people would welcome clear, measured regimes of punishment
over Confucian reliance on scholars&rsquo; moral intuition, AKA rule
of man. A widespread moral intuition that it was wrong to punish
sincere attempts to do the right thing fueled the Han (206
<small>BC</small>&ndash;<small>AD</small> 220) compromise of Confucian
and &ldquo;Legalist&rdquo; rule <em>by</em> law.</p>

<p>
Exposure to Western principled and logically conceived &ldquo;rule of
law&rdquo; offers an example of a social system that might make
punishment less arbitrary without relying on everyone having the same
morality (Hansen 1994). Chinese 19<sup>th</sup> C.
&ldquo;Westernizers&rdquo; headlined science and democracy, but all
sides now accept Western &ldquo;rule of law,&rdquo; although its
interpretation filtered through Marxism would hardly satisfy Daoists.
The key to a Daoist justification would be recognition that punishment
has had a natural evolutionary role and is naturally persistent. That
does not justify punishment but does justify introducing a social
practice that makes it more predictable, consistent and
transparent.</p>

<p>
Embracing logic, as modern Daoist did, made the Western conception of
rule of law intelligible as a way of achieving what the ancients
sought: enabling people to avoid arbitrary punishment. It is that
conception of the rule of law that enables liberal regimes to tolerate
a wide variety of ways of life. The parallels of this direction of
natural Daoist evolution of social mores and Western liberalism,
tempts us to interpret Daoism as individualism. It is important to
keep in mind the differences in how Daoists arrive at valuing maximal
equal freedom and toleration of many ways of life.</p>

<p>
It does not derive from either deontological reasoning (except for the
weak negative retributive insight) or metaphysical commitment to the
ego-self, reason, subjectivity etc. The embrace of Western Science
during the May 4 movement included the embrace of democracy, but
Daoism would see Mozi&rsquo;s conception of a leader-guided process of
moral construction as the insight that guidance comes to many
different indexical perspectives in nature. Each is already in motion,
committed to a plethora of paths and no one except those in relative
inertial systems are making the choice of this and not-that.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;I,&rdquo; as Zhuangzi tells us, would not be making choices
if there weren&rsquo;t internal states of &ldquo;happiness, anger,
sorrow, joy&hellip;&rdquo; (Zhuangzi 2:2&ndash;3). We choose the way
forward and react with these responses to the reality and learn. Our
families, communities, professions, orchestras, debate partners,
co-workers, change directions as we learn. Democracy doesn&rsquo;t
need an argument starting from the moral autonomy of the rational
soul. Science can tell us how social animals, from bee hives and ant
colonies to schools of fish, &ldquo;make decisions&rdquo; emerging
from the decisions of their parts, quorum sensing and voting with
their feet.</p>

<p>
The role of social leadership is perfecting our social systems of
decision making and <em>d&agrave;o</em> realization. It does not take
for granted that the decisions will take the form of enacting laws, so
does not rely on axioms of &ldquo;popular sovereignty.&rdquo; We
didn&rsquo;t <em>elect</em> Einstein as our model of scientific
open-mindedness. While we can tolerate something like the rule of law
based on <em>assuming</em> that we cannot eliminate
punishment<em>,</em> punitive instincts are not the source of moral
progress. Less punishment is better than more.</p>

<p>
Social science may uncover that democracy is a pre-requisite of rule
of law and reduces war and punishment. That is enough to contribute to
our choosing such a democratic <em>d&agrave;o</em>. The Daoist
derivation, however, would be from its equal concern and respect for
other points of view, not a meta-ethics of any majoritarian
<em>right</em> to coerce others.</p>

<p>
Daoism was also not alone in ancient China in being egalitarian (Munro
2001). Mohism was famously concerned about every human&rsquo;s
well-being, but even Confucians shared an assumption that everyone had
a <em>route</em> to a sage-morality. Daoism&rsquo;s early focus was on
how similar our <em>d&agrave;o</em>s were to those of all the other
natural living things. The element of nature &ldquo;worship&rdquo;
that emerges in Daoist guidance attitudes is broader equal respect for
all &ldquo;under the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Respect takes the form of acknowledging that while we may know better
what course other things should take, they occupy the position of
choosing and realizing it. Their perspective is corrigible and yet
privileged. Morality, like knowledge, is choosing and <em>realizing
d&agrave;o</em>s from more and wider points of view. It is not a
definition or formula but emerges from doing better as measured from
<em>here</em>. We construct it as our social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
evolve. The god&rsquo;s-eye view is not <em>zh&#275;n</em> (&#30495;
natural, authentic, true).</p>
