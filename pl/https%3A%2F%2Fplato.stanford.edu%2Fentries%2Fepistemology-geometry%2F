<h1>Epistemology of Geometry</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Oct 14, 2013; substantive revision Fri Sep 26, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Geometrical knowledge typically concerns two kinds of things:
theoretical or abstract knowledge contained in the definitions,
axioms, theorems, and proofs in a system of geometry; and some
knowledge of the external world, such as is expressed in terms of a
system of physical geometry. The nature of the relation between the
abstract geometry and its practical expression has also to be
considered.</p>

<p>
This essay considers various theories of geometry, their grounds for
intelligibility, for validity, and for physical interpretability in
the period largely before the advent of the theories of special and
general relativity in the 20th century. It turns out that a
complicated interplay between two basic properties of lines, being
shortest and being straightest, is at work in many stages.</p>

<p>
Before the 19th century only one geometry was studied in any depth or
thought to be an accurate or correct description of physical space,
and that was Euclidean geometry. The 19th century itself saw a
profusion of new geometries, of which the most important were
projective geometry and non-Euclidean (hyperbolic) geometry.
Projective geometry can be thought of as a deepening of the
non-metrical and formal sides of Euclidean geometry; non-Euclidean
geometry as a challenge to its metrical aspects and implications.</p>

<p>
By the opening years of the 20th century a variety of Riemannian
differential geometries had been proposed, which made rigorous sense
of non-Euclidean geometry. There were also significant advances in the
domain of abstract geometries, such as those proposed by David
Hilbert. It follows that the terms &lsquo;geometry&rsquo; and
&lsquo;physical space&rsquo; do not have simple meanings in the 19th
century, and changing conceptions of these terms do not follow a
simple pattern of refinement. Their interrelations therefore also have
a complicated history.</p>

<p>
Geometry has been a school of systematic logical thinking, with
Euclid&rsquo;s work taken to be the paradigm of a well-founded science
for millennia, but with a sudden change of views around 1900. It has
also been a place of privilege for the elaboration of mathematical
methods, from synthetic to analytic treatments, algebraic
developments, the rise of structuralism, and more. Contemplating the
development of geometry through the ages, one can see how it started
as the study of figures (and their measurement) to become the study of
space, and ended up being the study of spatial structures &ndash; from
the most basic topology, to <em>n</em>-manifolds, to the geometries
picked up by physicists.</p>

<p>
At the same time, geometry has posed fundamental epistemological
problems, and has been a decisive locus of philosophical debate. One
may quickly mention: 1, the problem of certainty and apriority of
geometric knowledge (linked to the question: one geometry, or many?);
2, the problem of the role of intuition (was Kant right? is the axiom
of parallels intuitively grounded?); 3, the problem of idealization,
concerning the relation between perfect geometric figures and their
real instantiations; 4, the shifting conceptions of the interrelation
between mathematics and natural science.</p>

<h2 id="EpisIssuEuclGeom">1. Epistemological issues in Euclid&rsquo;s geometry</h2>

<p>
Simplifying extremely, the history of geometry has seen two different
epochs, before and after 1850. We may take the work of Riemann as
marking the watershed. For most of history, there has been only one
geometric system, in essence that of Euclid. With Riemann (and a few
others writing in his time), we encounter a diversity of systems of
geometry. Before, it all seemed a matter of evidence and necessity,
afterwards, of the choice of axioms (or structures) either for purely
mathematical, or for physical reasons. We may speak of traditional
geometry versus the new geometries.</p>

<p>
If one adopts a 20<sup>th</sup>-century standpoint, we should start
from a distinction between formal geometry (abstract structures,
presented axiomatically) and physical geometry (the choice of one of
those structures for doing physics). But it&rsquo;s important to
realize that the traditional standpoint was nothing like that. The
distinction itself is the product of the shift we mentioned above.
Traditionally, geometry was an <em>interpreted</em> theory, its basic
terms having a clear and fixed meaning, its axioms being evident
truths.</p>

<p>
For many people in the traditional perspective, there was a noteworthy
coincidence of three things: the spatial traits of visual perception,
the (one and only) mathematical geometry, and the nature of physical
space. All three are Euclidean. The coincidence of 1 and 2 makes
geometry evident, that of 2 and 3 makes it necessary. Kant&rsquo;s
perspective on this science was perhaps the clearest manifestation of
this vision, the coincidence of seeing, thinking, and knowing. Compare
with the later perspective: in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, some have
argued that visual space is hyperbolic; everyone knows that geometries
are many; and space has been declared to be Riemannian. (We simplify a
bit, of course.)</p>

<p>
We start considering the case of Euclid&rsquo;s geometry, and some of
the epistemological issues it has raised.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s well known that Euclidean geometry was regarded as the
paradigm of rigorous scientific work, of systematic organization, of
truth and certainty. Examples of the uncontested status of geometry
are absolutely abundant, so we&rsquo;ll mention only three. David
Hume, although he was an extremely skeptical thinker, wrote:
&ldquo;Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the
truths, demonstrated by Euclid, would for ever retain their certainty
and evidence&rdquo; (<em>Enquiry</em> (1739&ndash;1740): I, section
4.2). Even J.H. Lambert, a critical philosopher-scientist who
pioneered hyperbolic geometry, acknowledged the truth of the axiom of
parallels&mdash;he wanted to improve the presentation, filling a key
gap, but he didn&rsquo;t dispute the truth (Lambert 1786). And a very
innovative mathematician, W. R. Hamilton, writing in 1837 (when
Lobachevskii was publishing) could still believe that:</p>

<p>
No candid and intelligent person can doubt the truth of the chief
properties of Parallel Lines, as set forth by Euclid in his Elements,
two thousand years ago; though he may well desire to see them treated
in a clearer and better method. The doctrine involves no obscurity nor
confusion of thought, and leaves in the mind no reasonable ground for
doubt, although ingenuity may usefully be exercised in improving the
plan of the argument. (Hamilton 1837, 294).</p>

<p>
As the reader can imagine, quotations from Plato, Kepler, Descartes,
Kant, and many more would be even more positive.</p>

<h3 id="QuesDiagCons">1.1 The question of diagrammatic constructions</h3>

<p>
Euclid&rsquo;s treatment of geometry has, through the ages, been
celebrated as a perfect deductive presentation of a science, and
certainly Euclid made great efforts to obtain a most careful logical
chain of truths. Book I in particular is impressive (see Lambert 1786,
Mueller 1981). Yet Euclid&rsquo;s proof-method gives a central role to
diagrams, for which reason his work came under severe criticism in the
late 19th century. This is because, from the early 18th century, there
was a gradual dominance of algebraic methods and a process of
de-geometrization of mathematics, which evolved into the so-called
&ldquo;arithmetization&rdquo; of mathematics. Diagrams were demoted to
the role of mere auxiliaries in mathematical reasoning, and a careful
logical presentation of axioms and proofs was implemented. One result
of this movement would be Hilbert&rsquo;s work, examined below.</p>

<p>
It seems nevertheless true that the origins of geometric thinking
have, in different cultures, always been associated with visuo-spatial
reasoning, and in particular with figures and diagrams. Also, this is
a key reason for the celebrated beauty and appeal of geometry. Kant
came close to capturing the spirit of Euclid&rsquo;s style of work
when he insisted that mathematical proof is based on the
&ldquo;construction of concepts&rdquo; in intuition (Kant&rsquo;s
<em>KrV</em>, B 741&ndash;744, B 865). The geometer works with
carefully defined concepts, for which Euclid always shows how to
construct instances (thus, e.g., proposition 1 shows how to construct
an equilateral triangle given a line segment, and Proposition 31 how
to construct a parallel to a given line). But, as Kant emphasized in a
famous passage of the <em>Critique</em>, logical analysis of the
concepts could never provide the means of proof &ndash; an appeal to
the construction (say, of a triangle) is required, offering a concrete
instance either in empirical intuition (an external representation) or
in pure intuition. Next, on the basis of the postulates, new elements
are incorporated into the construction, which make it possible to
interconnect concepts and obtain new results. So it is that one can
prove diagrammatically, e.g., that the angles of a triangle add up to
180&ordm; (which, by the way, requires an appeal to the parallel
postulate).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="equilateral.svg" alt="see description in next paragraph" />

<p class="center">
Constructing an equilaterial triangle</p>
</div>

<p>
The proof of Proposition 1 has famously been objected to for having a
gap. Given a segment \(AB\), an equilateral triangle is constructed by
drawing two circles with \(AB\) as radius, one centered on \(A\) and
the other centered on \(B\). The objection is that Euclid has no
continuity principle, hence the existence of point \(C\) (the
intersection of both circles) is not warranted. But such an objection
ignores the proper role of diagrammatic reasoning in Euclid. Manders
(2008) has provided an insightful analysis of how information is
obtained from text and diagram in the first books of the Elements, in
careful distribution of roles, which led him to distinguish between
exact information (from text only) and co-exact information (taken
from the diagram). Notice that a diagram is not just a figure, but a
reasoning tool, a semiotic element with rules of manipulation &ndash;
and, according to Manders, careful (implicit) rules for the extraction
of information. For further details on this topic, see the entry on
 <a href="../diagrams/">diagrams</a>,
 section 3.2.</p>

<p>
In this connection it is worth mentioning a famous fallacious proof
that all triangles are isosceles, which Klein made well known (1909,
202). One can show that this pseudo-proof violates the rules of the
game of Euclid, extracting exact information from the diagram, which
is never allowed. On the other hand, one should notice that
Euclid&rsquo;s postulates are not so much axioms in the Hilbertian
sense, as rules of construction that are applied in the elaboration
and handling of diagrams. Most of Euclid&rsquo;s postulates establish
that certain constructions can be performed, like the drawing of a
line or a circle, the meeting of two lines under certain conditions
(this last is Euclid&rsquo;s own formulation of postulate 5 &ldquo;of
the parallels&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
As for the central role of such rules of construction in ancient
geometry, it is interesting to remark that the Greeks used
&lsquo;diagramma&rsquo; to mean a mathematical proposition.</p>

<p>
But geometric knowledge, which began close to visual thinking
(Giaquinto 2007) and the practical manipulation of symbols, i.e.,
diagrams as concrete representations, gradually evolved to become a
more abstract edifice. Already with Euclid, Archimedes and Apollonius
there is an effort to give form to well-crafted concepts, which make
precise, ideal, and general what was suggested by intuition; likewise,
the way of handling diagrams is anything but naive (see, e.g.,
Proposition 10 in Book III, but also Propositions 7, 14 or 27 in Book
I). And in due course, a critical stage was attained, when the
assumptions of geometric knowledge were made explicit and subjected to
scrutiny, looking for deeper foundations and for alternatives. At this
stage, represented above all by the 19th century, the diagram had to
be relegated in favor of more explicit, abstract, relational methods
for the analysis of theoretical assumptions and developments.</p>

<h3 id="DeduInad">1.2 Deductive inadequacies</h3>

<p>
A detailed examination of geometry as Euclid presented it reveals a
number of problems. It is worth considering these in some detail
because the epistemologically convincing status of Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em> was uncontested by almost everyone until the later
decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Chief among these problems are
a lack of clarity in the definitions of straight line and plane, and
the problem whether shortest or straightest is the fundamental
geometrical property (see 1.3 below, and the many comments collected
in Heath&rsquo;s edition of Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>). The
implications for the parallel postulate will be treated separately,
see the section on
 <a href="#NonEuclGeom">Non-Euclidean geometry</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The first four books of Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> are about
straight lines and circles, but it is well known that the concept of a
straight line receives only a most unsatisfactory definition. A line
is said to be &ldquo;a breadthless length&rdquo;, and a straight line
to be a line &ldquo;which lies evenly with the points on
itself&rdquo;. This may help convince readers that they share a common
conception of the straight line, but it is no use if unexpected
difficulties arise in the creation of a theory&mdash;as we shall
see.</p>

<p>
To those who decided to read the <em>Elements</em> carefully and see
how the crucial terms are used, it became apparent that the account is
both remarkably scrupulous in some ways and flawed in others. Straight
lines arise almost always as finite segments that can be indefinitely
extended, but, as many commentators noted, although Euclid stated that
there is a segment joining any two points he did not explicitly say
that this segment is unique. This is a flaw in the proof of the first
congruence theorem (I.4) which says that if two triangles have two
pairs of sides equal and the included angle is equal then the
remaining sides of the triangles are equal.</p>

<p>
Theorem I.4 is interesting in another way. Theorem I.2 carries a
scrupulous, and by no means obvious, proof that a given line segment
in a plane may be copied exactly with one of its end points at any
prescribed point in the plane. Theorem I.4 properly requires a proof
that an angle may likewise be copied exactly at an arbitrary point,
but this Euclid cannot provide at this stage (one is given in I.23,
which, however, builds on these earlier results). He therefore gave a
bald claim that one triangle may be copied exactly in an arbitrary
position, which makes one wonder why such care was expended on I.2. In
fact, the whole concept of motion of figures was to become a prolonged
topic of discussion in Arabic/Islamic times, and later, but Euclid
seems to have attempted to avoid completely the motion of figures. (On
deduction in Euclid, see Mueller 1981.)</p>

<p>
A plausible reading of <em>Elements</em> Book I is that a straight
line can be understood as having a direction, so that there is a
straight line in every direction at every point and only one straight
line at a given point in a given direction. The parallel postulate
then says that lines which cross a given line in equal angles point in
the same direction and do not meet. But this must be regarded as an
interpretation, and one that requires quite some work to make
precise.</p>

<p>
Direction is, nonetheless, a more plausible candidate than distance;
Euclid did not start with the idea that the straight line joining two
distinct points is the shortest curve joining them. The relevant
primitive concept in the <em>Elements</em> is that of equality of
segments, such as all the radii of a given circle. Euclid stated as
Common Notion 4 that if two segments can be made to coincide then they
are equal, and (in the troublesome I.4) he used the converse, that if
two segments are equal then they can be made to coincide. Segments are
such that either one is smaller than the other or they are equal, and
in I.20 Euclid showed that &ldquo;in any triangle two sides taken
together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.&rdquo; This
result has become known as the triangle inequality, and it goes a long
way to proving that the line segment joining any two distinct points
is the shortest curve through those points. Once the parallel
postulate is introduced Euclid showed that opposite sides of a
parallelogram are equal, and so the distance between a pair of
parallel lines is a constant.</p>

<p>
But there is another weakness in the <em>Elements</em> that is also
worth noting, although it drew less attention, and this is the nature
of the plane. The plane has another sub-standard definition, evidently
modelled on that of the line: &ldquo;a plane surface is a surface
which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself&rdquo; (and,
unsurprisingly, &ldquo;a surface is that which has length and breadth
only&rdquo;). After that, the word &lsquo;plane&rsquo; is not
mentioned in the first four Books, although they are solely concerned
with plane geometry. When Euclid turned to solid geometry in Book IX,
he began with three theorems to show successively that a straight line
cannot lie partly in a plane and partly not, that if two straight
lines cut one another they lie in a plane and every triangle lies in a
plane, and that if two planes meet then they do so in a line. However,
he can only be said to claim these results and make them plausible,
because he cannot use his definition of a plane to prove any of them.
They do, however, form the basis for the next theorems: there is a
perpendicular to a plane at any point of the plane, and all the lines
perpendicular to a given straight line at a given point are on a
plane.</p>

<p>
Once again, I.4 is problematic. Consider, for the purpose of a
<em>reduction ad absurdum,</em> that one has two triangles, \(ABC\)
and \(A'BC\) on the same side of their common base \(BC\), and such
that \(BA = BA'\) and \(CA = CA'\). It is intended to show that
therefore the vertices \(A\) and \(A'\) coincide, and for this one
must, as Gauss observed (in unpublished remarks, see Gauss 1900: 193),
use the fact that the triangles lie in the same plane. A good
definition of a plane is required, one that allows this result to be
proved.</p>

<h3 id="SyntMethVsMeas">1.3 Synthetic method vs. measurement</h3>

<p>
Let us say that a purely synthetic geometry is one that deals with
primitive concepts such as straight lines and planes in something like
the above fashion. That is, it takes the straightness of the straight
line and the flatness of the plane as fundamental, and appeals to the
incidence properties just described. It is resistant to the idea of
taking distance as a fundamental concept, or to the idea of replacing
statements in geometry by statements about numbers (say, as
coordinates), although it is not hostile to coordinate geometry being
erected upon it.</p>

<p>
Let us also say for present purposes that a metrical geometry is one
in which distance is a primitive concept, so line segments can be said
to have the same length, congruent figures have corresponding sides
equal in length, and geometrical transformations preserve lengths. We
can also allow that similarities are admitted: these are
transformations that produce scale copies of figures. (No theorem in
Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> depends on the actual size of a
figure: any theorem that applies to one figure applies to all its
scale copies.)</p>

<p>
Elementary geometry in the modern West moved in a confused way towards
making distance the primary primitive concept, while often maintaining
the Euclidean emphasis on straightness, thus frequently muddling the
implications of the different concepts. A notable example of this
being nonetheless productive was John Wallis&rsquo;s argument in
defence of the parallel postulate (given as a lecture in 1665 and
published in Wallis 1693). It rested, as he realised, on the ability
to make arbitrary scale copies of a triangle, and this seems to be the
first time that the equivalence was recognised between these two
systems:</p>

<ol>

<li>Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> with the parallel postulate</li>

<li>Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> without that postulate but adding
the assumption that arbitrary similar figures exist</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the <em>Encylop&eacute;die m&eacute;thodique</em> (1784: vol. 2,
132), d&rsquo;Alembert defined geometry as the science of the
properties of extension, i.e., of bodies (and surfaces and lines)
considered as merely extended and figured. Its principles are founded,
in his view, on truths so evident that it is not possible to contest
them. A line (in the sense of a curve) is one-dimensional, and the
shortest line joining two points is the straight line. Parallel lines
are lines that, however far they are extended, will never meet because
they are everywhere equidistant. D&rsquo;Alembert was not keen on
axiomatic presentation of the material, and so it was also with many
other 18th-century authors.</p>

<p>
Adrien-Marie Legendre was a mathematician sympathetic to the didactic
aims of the <em>Elements</em> but not to its original formulations. He
wrote several different versions of his <em>&Eacute;l&eacute;ments de
g&eacute;om&eacute;trie</em> (1794) with a view to restoring
&ldquo;Euclidean rigour&rdquo; in the teaching of geometry, which in
his view had been corroded by texts, such as one by Clairaut (1741),
that relied on notions of self-evidence. Those versions differ
largely, as he had to admit, in their unsuccessful attempts to deduce
the parallel postulate.</p>

<p>
Legendre took a firmly metrical point of view, taking as given algebra
and the theory of proportions. His opening definition of the first
edition proclaimed that &ldquo;Geometry is a science that has as its
object the measure of extent&rdquo;. Extent, he explained, has three
dimensions, length, breadth, and height; a line is a length without
breadth, its extremities are called points and a point therefore has
no extent. A straight line is the shortest path from one point to
another; and a plane is a surface in which if two arbitrary points are
joined by a straight line this line lies entirely in the surface. He
then set out to prove even some truths that Euclid had preferred to
assume, such as (Legendre&rsquo;s first result): any two right angles
are equal. The notion of congruence was central to his approach, and
familiar congruence theorems follow in each edition until the parallel
postulate could no longer be ignored. Once the existence of parallel
lines was assured, Legendre argued that they were equidistant.</p>

<p>
In fact, Legendre&rsquo;s attempts to restore rigour to the treatment
of elementary geometry was no better than Euclid&rsquo;s, and in some
ways worse, not only because his attempts to prove the parallel
postulate inevitably failed, but because he smuggled more into his
account than he realised. Its chief significance for present purposes
is that it exemplifies the attempt to ground elementary geometry on a
concept of distance; more precisely, on the idea that a straight line
is the curve of shortest distance between any of its points. Distance
itself is not defined.</p>

<p>
Joseph Fourier, in a discussion with Monge (Bonola 1912, sec. 26) also
took the concept of distance as fundamental, and began with
three-dimensional space. He then employed equidistance to define
successively the sphere, the plane (as the points equidistant from two
given points) and the line (as the points equidistant from three given
points). This did at least give him definitions of these previously
troubling concepts (see Bonola 1912, 54).</p>

<p>
To conclude: a reasonable view at the time would have been that
metrical geometry needed to put its house in order, and it probably
could not do so by grafting the concept of distance onto a structure
modelled on Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>. This is an awkward
position for traditional geometry to be in, and it may have opened
people&rsquo;s minds to the possibilities of alternatives. Certainly,
two were to be produced. One, projective geometry, amplified and
improved the synthetic side of geometry. The other, non-Euclidean
geometry, was a new and challenging metrical geometry. But before we
look at them, we turn to contemporary philosophical discussions.</p>

<h2 id="EpisIssuPhysGeom">2. Epistemological issues in physical geometry</h2>

<p>
It is a useful over-simplification to say that around 1800 the view
was that there is one physical space, and that this space is described
by the geometry in Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>, which is the only
candidate for such a task. Disputes concerned the rigorous
presentation of this geometry and the limits of its application to the
physical world. The nature of the knowledge that geometry provided was
also a matter of some discussion.</p>

<p>
Traditionally, geometry had been regarded as a paradigm of truth,
certainty, and justification. This can be found e.g. in many authors
of the 17th century. Descartes was ready to criticize the Euclidian
method for a certain stiffness, which made it difficult to find the
solution of new problems, and he sought to alleviate it by combining
algebra and geometry; yet, even so, he always emphasized the clarity
and evidence of geometry and its demonstrations. According to Pascal,
geometry was the perfect illustration of the methods of demonstrating
truths, and of establishing a body of propositions in methodical
order. Hobbes famously learned geometry from the <em>Elements</em>
when he was already 40, became convinced of its truth, and fell in
love with the science. Leibniz, Spinoza, and others continued taking
mathematics as a model for philosohical discourse.</p>

<p>
Locke (see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/" target="other">Locke</a>)
 took from the Aristotelian tradition the idea that Euclidean geometry
and rational theology are the exemplars of scientific knowledge, but
sought to ground his philosophy in intuitive, demonstrative, and
sensitive kinds of knowledge. Intuitive knowledge is what is grasped
immediately; demonstrative knowledge avails itself of the intermediate
steps of a proof, as in geometry. Both these forms of knowledge are
certain. Sensitive knowledge is not certain: it is what we learn
through our senses, it presents effects but not causes, it is at best
partial and may be deceptive. Space can be thought of as composed of
all (actual and possible) positions of objects; pure space is space
with all solid bodies removed, and distance the primitive concept we
use to discuss the separation between bodies.</p>

<p>
Locke offered arguments against innatist interpretations of our
knowledge of space and figures, emphasizing the primary role of
experience (see the entry on Molyneux problem). Yet in his <em>Essay
Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1690) Locke asserted that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;the idea of a right-lined triangle necessarily carries with it
an equality of its angles to two right ones. Nor can we conceive this
relation, this connexion of these two ideas, to be possibly mutable,
or to depend on any arbitrary Power, which of choice made it thus, or
could make it otherwise. (<em>Essay</em> IV.iii.29, 1690:
559&ndash;560)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sensitive knowledge of the corresponding objects, however, could never
have this degree of certainty, and because our knowledge derives from
our knowledge of objects it would seem that scientific knowledge of
space is of a different kind from our knowledge of geometry. Thus, for
Locke, Euclidean geometry provided one kind of knowledge, and
experience and scientific experiment, another. One might say that an
epistemological gap remains to this day in philosophy in the form of a
distinction between empirical and a priori knowledge that is still
widely recognised.</p>

<p>
In Kant&rsquo;s <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (1781/1787) (see the
entry
 <a href="../kant-spacetime/">Kant&rsquo;s views on space and time</a>)
 the situation is more complicated or sophisticated. Kant introduced
the notion of <em>synthetic a priori</em> knowledge (in contrast to
both a posteriori, and analytical knowledge) to allow for the
existence of knowledge that did not rely on experience but was not
tautological in character (not analytic). Paradigmatic synthetic a
priori statements would be the truths of Euclidean geometry; thus he
ascribed certainty and necessity to geometry. Kant associated
geometric knowledge with the pure intution of space; to know that an
isosceles triangle (i.e. with two equal sides) has two equal angles at
the base, the mathematician must produce a particular construction
that makes the truth of the claim demonstrable. Thus, key in the
method of geometry is what he called &ldquo;the construction of
concepts&rdquo; in pure intuition (<em>Critique,</em> A 716, B 744).
This can be regarded as a sensible reflection of the method employed
in Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>, where the diagram is at the
center (see section 1.1). Kant&rsquo;s views were extremely
influential during the 19th century (see e.g. the work of Hamilton,
mentioned above, or Frege&rsquo;s views on geometry), but the
emergence of non-Euclidean geometries was regarded by many as a
refutation of his standpoint.</p>

<p>
Among the French philosophes, the dominant position in the 1740s was
the Cartesian one, which, as exemplified by Clairaut&rsquo;s
<em>&Eacute;l&eacute;mens de g&eacute;om&eacute;trie</em> (1741) was
perhaps unduly na&iuml;ve in its insistence on clear and immediate
ideas. The position of d&rsquo;Alembert was more sophisticated. The
objects of geometry are to be understood by abstracting from bodies
every quality except that of being divisible and figured extents.
Among these objects are lines, that lack breadth, and surfaces, that
lack depth. Truths established about the objects of geometry are
purely abstract and hypothetical, because there is no such thing, for
example, as a perfect circle. The demonstrated properties can hold of
actual circles only insofar as the actual object approaches the state
of being a perfect circle,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
They are, in some sense, a limit and, if one can put it this way, the
asymptote of physical truths, the term for those objects that approach
as closely as one wishes without ever arriving at it exactly.
(<em>Encylop&eacute;die m&eacute;thodique</em>, 1784: II, 132.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, if mathematical theorems do not exactly hold in nature, these
theorems serve with more than sufficient precision in practice. To be
demonstrated with complete rigour they must be considered as holding
of bodies in a state of abstract perfection that they do not really
have.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The curves studied in geometry are not perfectly straight nor
perfectly curved, the surfaces are not perfectly flat nor perfectly
curved, but the more nearly they are so, the more they approach the
state of having those properties that one proves about lines exactly
straight or curved, and of surfaces exactly flat or curved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These reflexions, d&rsquo;Alembert continued, will be enough to refute
the sceptics, who complain that geometrical objects do not really
exist, and others ignorant of mathematics who regard it as a useless
game.</p>

<p>
It would seem, therefore, that philosophers found no problems in
Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>, but Hume, d&rsquo;Alembert, and
others of an empiricist persuasion qualified the applicability of the
theorems on the grounds that the objects of geometry might have no
corresponding objects in the world. Philosophers more open to the idea
of a wide range of certain knowledge (as, for example, Kant) could
grant geometrical theorems the status of a priori truths that cannot
be other than they are.</p>

<h3 id="ImplMech">2.1 Implications of mechanics</h3>

<p>
Physical space was the na&iuml;ve, three-dimensional version of the
space of Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> and of Cartesian
coordinatised three-dimensional geometry, and this was how Newton had
regarded it in his <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (1687). It was
conceived of as a neutral arena, unaffected by matter or forces, but
conditioning the movements of physical bodies. The concept of gravity,
as a force acting at a distance, was regarded by mathematicians in the
Cartesian tradition as mysterious, even unacceptable, but by the start
of the 19<sup>th</sup> century had become a natural, primitive concept
no longer in need of further explanation.</p>

<p>
As Newton put it at the end of his first Scholium, the purpose of his
treatise was to show &ldquo;how to determine true motions from their
causes, effects, and apparent differences, and, conversely, of how to
determine from motions, whether true or apparent, their causes and
effects&rdquo;. Physical space, as described by Newton in his
<em>Principia,</em> is to be studied by passing from observations of
bodies in motion relative to one another and timed by an arbitrary
clock to the corresponding true motion in absolute space and time.</p>

<p>
There was clearly no doubt in Newton&rsquo;s mind about the Euclidean
nature of physical space, and indeed there seem to have been no doubts
among astronomers in the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18th century that space
was describable in the terms used in Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>.
It is also likely that the growing recognition of the merits of
Newton&rsquo;s physics cemented a belief that space was
three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, and to be described as if
it was an infinite coordinate grid, thus exemplifying the
theorems&mdash;if not precisely the definitions&mdash;of the
<em>Elements</em>.</p>

<p>
The interaction between geometrical aspects of physical space, and
mechanical behaviour of bodies, is clear in the statement of
Newton&rsquo;s first law (see the entry on inertial frames):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving
uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to
change its state by forces impressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is also the result that a homogeneous spherical solid exerts the
same gravitational effect on other bodies as would an equal mass
concentrated at the centre of the body. That is to say, such bodies
behave in a way that is provably, and not merely approximately, the
same as point masses. In this way points and lines acquired physical
significance in his theory of dynamics.</p>

<p>
It was Laplace who gave the strongest argument for saying that
physical space obeys Euclidean geometry. In his <em>Exposition du
syst&egrave;me du monde</em> of 1796 he added an interesting note
(quoted in Bonola 1912: 54) to say that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The attempts of geometers to prove Euclid&rsquo;s Postulate on
Parallels have been up till now futile. However, no one can doubt this
postulate and the theorems which Euclid deduced from it. Thus the
notion of space includes a special property, self-evident, without
which the properties of parallels cannot be rigorously established.
The idea of a bounded region, e.g., the circle, contains nothing which
depends on its absolute magnitude. But if we imagine its radius to
diminish, we are brought without fail to the diminution in the same
ratio of its circumference and the sides of all the inscribed figures.
This proportionality appears to me a more natural postulate than that
of Euclid, and it is worthy of note that it is discovered afresh in
the results of the theory of universal gravitation. (Book V, Ch. V, p.
472)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is strikingly similar to the view of Wallis well over a century
before, although Laplace did not mention Wallis and may not have known
of his discussion on the parallel postulate.</p>

<p>
Around 1800, therefore, it was generally true that problems with the
truth claims of Euclidean geometry had been located among the problems
about our knowledge of the external world. Confidence in philosophical
and scientific circles in the validity of Euclidean geometry per se
was very high.</p>

<h2 id="NewGeom">3. New geometries</h2>

<p>
In the opinion of many in the 19th century, Euclidean geometry lost
its fundamental status to a geometry that was regarded as more
general: projective geometry. (For an introduction to geometry in the
19th century, see Gray 2011; projective geometry is described in the
entry
 <a href="../geometry-19th/">Nineteenth Century Geometry</a>;
 see also the essays by various authors in Bioesmat-Martagon 2011.)
Projective geometry has its own foundational problem, akin to that of
distance in Euclidean geometry, which concerns the concept of
cross-ratio. It also raised epistemological issues, resolved in
association with Klein&rsquo;s Erlangen Programme; and its growth
created the arena for Hilbert&rsquo;s axiomatisation of geometry.</p>

<h3 id="ProjGeom">3.1 Projective geometry</h3>

<p>
The origins of this geometric theory lay in the 17th century, with
Desargues and Pascal, but plane projective geometry took a particular
boost from Jean Victor Poncelet&rsquo;s book of 1822 <em>Trait&eacute;
des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s projectives des figures</em> where he
showed the power of projective methods under the provocative
formulation of non-metrical geometry. The fundamental character of the
new geometry resides in the way it can be thought of as capturing the
simplest properties of the straight line&mdash;two distinct points
define a unique line, two distinct lines meet in at most one
point&mdash;while discarding the metrical concepts of distance and
angle.</p>

<p>
Poncelet&rsquo;s claims for transformations of the plane that map
lines to lines were rewritten by Chasles (1837) in a more rigorous way
that highlighted the invariance of cross-ratio. However, this left the
subject in the uncomfortable position of seeming to be more general
than Euclidean geometry, because Euclidean, metrical transformations
are projective transformations but not conversely, while still seeming
to rely on a metrical concept in the definition of its fundamental
invariant, cross-ratio.</p>

<p>
This issue was tackled in the 1840s and 1850s by Georg Karl Christian
von Staudt, who started the task of creating a rigorous theory
independent from metrical ideas. In his work <em>Geometrie der
Lage</em> (1847), he also made brief remarks about how Euclidean
geometry could be obtained from projective geometry, and from these it
could be seen that his theory of collinear quadruples reduced to the
familiar theory of cross-ratio as soon as the concept of Euclidean
distance was added to projective geometry. This insight was made clear
and explicit by Felix Klein in papers in the early 1870s (Klein 1871,
1873). The first readable textbook on projective geometry, and the one
that gave it its name, was Cremona&rsquo;s <em>Elementi di geometria
projettiva</em> of 1873, and after that the subject swiftly rose to
become the fundamental classical geometry.</p>

<p>
Its basic concepts were the points, lines, and planes of a space that
was \(\mathbb{R}^3\) enriched with what was often called a plane at
infinity, so that any two coplanar lines meet. Prior to
axiomatisations of the theory at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, point, line, and plane were basic concepts with an intuitive
interpretation that allowed for a ready passage between projective and
Euclidean geometry. The allowed transformations of the geometry map
points to points, lines to lines, and planes to planes and preserve
cross-ratio. They act transitively on the space, so no point, line, or
plane is special, and therefore lines that are parallel in any finite
part of the space may be mapped to intersecting lines and vice
versa.</p>

<p>
In its synthetic form the successes of projective geometry were
largely confined to the simplification it brought to the study of
conics&mdash;all non-degenerate conics (the circle, ellipse, parabola,
and hyperbola) are projectively equivalent. In its algebraic form
projective geometry proved itself almost essential in the study of
plane algebraic curves of any degree, and, extended to projective
spaces of higher dimensions, to the study of algebraic surfaces. All
this contributed to the central importance attributed to a
non-metrical geometry based on little more than the concept of the
straight line and on the incidence properties of lines and planes.</p>

<p>
Projective geometry also possessed one startling feature, called
duality, which stimulated epistemological reflections on its possible
source. In plane projective geometry it is possible to exchange the
terms &lsquo;point&rsquo; and &lsquo;line&rsquo;,
&lsquo;coincident&rsquo; and &lsquo;concurrent&rsquo;, and in this way
obtain from a valid statement a new one. As a result all definitions,
theorems, and proofs in projective geometry have a dual character. The
dual of the statement of Desargues&rsquo;s theorem and its proof, for
example, is the converse of the theorem and its proof. In three
dimensions, the terms &lsquo;point&rsquo; and &lsquo;plane&rsquo; can
be exchanged in the same way, leaving &lsquo;lines&rsquo; unchanged.
This raises intriguing epistemological issues: duality was regarded by
Cremona as a law of logic; also, it is easy to conceive of the plane
as made up of points, but impossible to regard it intuitively as made
up of lines. To make matters worse, space is three-dimensional when
regarded as made up of points, but four-dimensional when made up of
lines.</p>

<p>
Klein&rsquo;s Erlangen Programme and what has become known as the
Kleinian view of geometry are described in the entry,
 <a href="../geometry-19th/">Nineteenth Century Geometry</a>.
 They have come to stand as the principal source of the view that
geometry can be defined as a group acting on a space, and a
geometrical property is any property invariant under all the
transformations of the appropriate group.</p>

<p>
Klein advocated this view in a pamphlet published when he became a
Professor at the University of Erlangen (Klein 1872) and other
publications in the 1870s in order to re-unify geometry. He presented
a way of showing that metrical geometries, such as Euclidean and
non-Euclidean geometry, and other geometries, such as inversive
geometry and birational geometry, can be regarded as special cases of
projective geometry (as can affine geometry, which he did not know
about in 1872).</p>

<p>
The fundamental geometry was real projective geometry, say in two
dimensions. In this geometry the space is real projective space, and
the group is the group of all projective transformations. Such a
transformation maps points to points, lines to lines, curves of degree
\(n\) to curves of degree \(n\), and, importantly, the cross-ratio of
four collinear points is left unaltered by any projective
transformation. In the Kleinian viewpoint, this establishes that
points, lines, curves of degree \(n\), and the cross-ratio of four
collinear points are properties of this geometry.</p>

<p>
Projective geometry incorporated the other geometries in a variety of
ways. Klein indicated that one may seek to add to the list of
configurations, in which case the group that keeps them invariant will
generally be smaller than the principal group, or one may seek to
enlarge the group, in which case the class of invariant configurations
will generally shrink. Klein succeeded in showing that non-Euclidean
geometry arises as a sub-geometry by considering the interior of a
conic in projective space and confining attention to the subgroup that
maps the interior of that conic to itself (see Klein 1871; 1873).</p>

<p>
The character of Klein&rsquo;s Erlangen Programme becomes clearer when
one looks at how it resolved the well-known nagging doubt about the
definition of cross-ratio in projective geometry. Klein&rsquo;s answer
proceeded by analogy with lengths in Euclidean or non-Euclidean
geometry. In those geometries, the corresponding group preserves
straight lines, and any point can be mapped to any other point, but
there is no transformation in the group that can map a line segment
onto a proper sub-segment of itself. Any arbitrary but fixed line
segment (determined by two points) can therefore be taken as unit of
length and used to measure line segments, by constructing arbitrary
multiples and sub-multiples of it and arranging them as one would a
ruler. Now to measure the length of a segment \(AB\), one simply lays
the point \(A\) at one end of the ruler and sees where the point \(B\)
falls on the ruler.</p>

<p>
Klein&rsquo;s insight, following von Staudt, was that an exactly
similar argument involving quadruples of collinear points can be used
to define cross-ratio in projective geometry. The projective group
preserves straight lines, and any ordered triple of collinear points
can be mapped to any ordered triple of collinear points, and the map
that sends a given ordered triple of distinct points to another
ordered triple of distinct points is unique, but there is no
transformation in the group that can map a quadruple of four collinear
points onto an arbitrary such quadruple. Any arbitrary but fixed
collinear quadruple can therefore be taken as unit of
&lsquo;size&rsquo;, and a complicated but not difficult argument
allows one to produce arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples of it that
can be used to measure cross-ratios, by arranging as one would a
ruler. Rather than give the details, it is better to give this
suggestive illustration of why this can be done. Let the cross-ratio
of the four collinear points \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\), \(S\) be measured by
mapping the points onto the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) on the
real line, where \(A\) is at the origin, \(C\) at \(\infty\), and
\(D\) at 1, so it is the position of \(B\) that determines the
cross-ratio. This is uniquely determined, and if the length of \(AB\)
is \(x\), we find that \(AB{.}CD \mathbin{/} AD{.}CB = x\).</p>

<p>
In the language of the time, length is a two-point invariant of the
Euclidean or non-Euclidean group, and cross-ratio is a four-point
invariant of the projective group.</p>

<h3 id="HilbOtheAxioProjGeom">3.2 Hilbert and others on axiomatic projective geometry</h3>

<p>
Problems with some technical issues in projective geometry, and the
rising standards of rigour at the end of the 19th century, provoked
attempts to axiomatise the subject. The task was taken up by Moritz
Pasch, and most energetically by Italian geometers Pieri and Peano,
and others in the second half of the 19th century, and they succeeded
in giving a rigorous account of real and complex projective geometry
in two and three dimensions (see Marchisotto and Smith 2007). But they
managed at the same time to reduce the subject to a rigorous training
for geometry teachers, and did not appreciate the avenues for research
that they had opened. It was left to David Hilbert to revitalise the
axiomatic approach to geometry (see Hallett and Majer 2004).</p>

<p>
Despite his empiricist standpoint, Pasch made clear the new
requirements of a purely mathematical system of geometry. He explained
that, if geometry is to be really deductive, the deductions
&ldquo;must everywhere be independent of the <em>sense</em> of
geometrical concepts, just as it must be independent of the figures;
only the <em>relations</em> specified in the propositions and
definitions employed may legitimately be taken into account.&rdquo; If
some proof makes indispensable appeal to the meaning of terms, or to
the figures, the inadequacy of that proof will be made manifest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If, however, a theorem is rigorously derived from a set of
propositions&mdash;the <em>basic</em> set [of axioms]&mdash;the
deduction has a value which goes beyond its original purpose. For if,
on replacing the geometric terms in the basic set of propositions by
certain other terms true propositions are obtained, then corresponding
replacements may be made in the theorem; in this way we obtain new
theorems as consequences of the altered basic propositions without
having to repeat the proof. (Pasch 1882, 98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such moves definitively contributed to the elimination of diagrammatic
reasoning from admissible proofs. In his lectures, Hilbert emphasized
that one must always make sure that the operations applied to a figure
remain correct from a purely logical perspective. In this abstract
geometry, the role of axioms was significantly different from what had
been the function of postulates in ancient times. In due course, the
word &lsquo;axiom&rsquo; would lose its previous meaning of evident
truth (or, as Kantians said, of synthetic a priori principle).</p>

<p>
Hilbert had been introduced to a number of controversies about
elementary projective geometry that concerned what results in what
settings implied what other results. The most notable concerned
Desargues&rsquo;s theorem (see Arana and Mancosu 2012). In
three-dimensional projective geometry, Desargues&rsquo;s theorem is a
consequence of the incidence axioms alone, but it is a theorem about
points and lines in a projective plane (and so in two-dimensional
geometry) yet no-one had been able to derive it from the incidence
axioms of two-dimensional projective geometry. It had come to be
suspected that it might not be deducible from those axioms alone, and
Giuseppe Peano was able to show that indeed it could not be deduced
without some extra assumptions. Independently, Hilbert also gave an
example of a geometry meeting all the incidence axioms of
two-dimensional projective geometry but in which Desargues&rsquo;s
theorem was false (later replaced by the simpler example found by
American mathematician and astronomer F.R. Moulton). On this topic
compare the different English editions of (Hilbert 1899, sec. 23),
especially those of 1903 and 1971.</p>

<p>
Hilbert&rsquo;s <em>Grundlagen der Geometrie</em> (1899, 1903, etc.)
was an epoch-making text that marked the style of 20th-century
mathematics. It combined a new understanding of axiomatics, based on
the language of set theory, and an incipient structuralist view of the
theory under study. In the axiomatic geometries that Hilbert put
forward, the fundamental objects (points, lines, planes) are not
defined. Instead, Hilbert specified the network of relations that
links them, which determines how they can be used and what can be said
about them. He presented five families of axioms, sorted according to
the concepts they codified.</p>

<p>
He then explored a variety of geometries obeying a variety of axiom
systems, and was able to study issues of dependence and independence
by offering diverse interpretations of the basic terms and relations.
He also established the consistency of those geometries by giving them
coordinates over suitable rings and fields&mdash;often his geometries
admit many interpretations or models. Here Hilbert took advantage of
his expertise in the novel theories of number fields, to which he had
contributed in the 1890s. The consistency of geometry was reduced to
that of arithmetic, and this increased Hilbert&rsquo;s interest in
attempts to ground arithmetic in some form of set theory and
logic.</p>

<p>
Hilbert&rsquo;s approach thrived because he had come to realise that
there was a mathematics of axioms, a study of different but
interrelated axioms and their implications, and of axiom system and
its possible interpretations (models). He employed this new method to
solve questions about independence and consistency, hoping to find
also new insights into simplicity, the solubility of mathematical
problems, and decidability. The importance of Hilbert&rsquo;s geometry
is not to be found so much in the field of geometry itself, where it
may seem outdated, but in the way it showed how to formalize
mathematics and how to study central foundational questions.</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute;, in his review (1902) of Hilbert&rsquo;s book,
accepted the new pure geometries as valid, but regretted that they
were, as he put it, incomplete, because they lacked a psychological
component. By this he meant that Hilbert&rsquo;s focus on abstract
theory disregarded the epistemological questions of the origins of our
knowledge of space, and the adequate geometric framework for physical
theory (see section 6.2 below). These were questions that had been
forcefully promoted by the debate on non-Euclidean geometries.</p>

<h3 id="NonEuclGeom">3.3 Non-Euclidean geometry</h3>

<p>
Although the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of Euclidean geometry, and of the
axiom of parallels, was universally acknowledged, investigations of
the parallel postulate began in ancient Greek times, and continued in
the Islamic world and in the early modern West. But, for reasons which
are still unclear, after around 1800 it became easier for people to
imagine that Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> might not be the only
possible system of metrical geometry. Among the factors that can help
explain how the unthinkable became thinkable even outside the
community of mathematicians was the accumulation of theorems based on
assumptions other than the parallel postulate. It would seem that the
production of novel, consistent consequences of such a radical
assumption, and the failure to find a contradiction, inclined some
people to contemplate that there might indeed be a whole geometry
different from Euclid&rsquo;s. It may also be relevant that this
process coincided with the full assimilation of imaginary numbers (and
the rise of complex function theory); indeed, Lobachevskii called his
theory &ldquo;imaginary geometry&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
A change in attitudes can be noticed already by the late 18th century.
In his <em>Essais sur les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de philosophie</em>
(1759) d&rsquo;Alembert called the problem of parallel lines &ldquo;le
scandale des &eacute;l&eacute;ments de g&eacute;om&eacute;trie&rdquo;.
In 1763, the dissertation of G. S. Kl&uuml;gel examined a large number
of attempts to prove the parallel postulate, concluding that they were
all faulty: the result can be proven on the basis of axioms
&ldquo;that are not clearer or more secure than Euclid&rsquo;s&rdquo;,
and thus Euclid was indeed right to include among the axioms &ldquo;a
proposition that cannot be demonstrated in correct form&rdquo;.
Kl&uuml;gel&rsquo;s discussion called special attention to
Saccheri&rsquo;s work (1733) as the most detailed treatment in modern
times, and stimulated Lambert to do his own detailed work on the topic
(1786). Later on, in 1816, Gauss restated in print that the constantly
increasing number of attempts to prove the postulate do not fill the
gap, and that one should honestly and openly admit that &ldquo;in
essence we have not come farther than Euclid 2000 years ago&rdquo;
(Gauss <em>Werke</em> vol. 8, 170).</p>

<p>
Perhaps the signal example of this shift is the Law Professor F. K.
Schweikart, who in 1818 sent Gauss (via Gerling, a colleague and
former student of his at the University of Marburg) an account of a
geometry quite different from Euclid&rsquo;s. Schweikart&rsquo;s
geometry was accepted by Gauss, who replied that all the properties of
the new geometry could be derived once a value was given for a
constant that appeared in Schweikart&rsquo;s account. But on what
grounds Gauss had accepted it, is less clear.</p>

<p>
Credit for the first fully mathematical descriptions of space in terms
other than Euclid&rsquo;s must go to J&aacute;nos Bolyai in Hungary
and Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevskii in Russia, independently. Bolyai in
his &ldquo;Appendix scientiam spatii absolute veram exhibens&rdquo;
(1832), and Lobachevskii in geometric researches published in German
(1835, 1840), replaced the parallel postulate with the assumption that
given a line L and a point not on that line, there are many lines
through the point that lie in the plane defined by L and the given
point, but that do not meet the line L. Of these, as they then showed,
one line in each direction is asymptotic to L, and these asymptotic
lines divide the family of all the other lines in the given plane and
through the given point into two families: those that meet L, and
those that do not. Much work then followed, famously similar in each
case, in particular to show that in the three-dimensional space
described by their assumptions there is a surface upon which Euclidean
geometry holds, and to deduce the existence of trigonometrical
formulae describing triangles in the plane. As Lambert had already
suggested, these formulae resemble the corresponding formulae for
triangles on the sphere.</p>

<p>
All this convinced both Bolyai and Lobachevskii that the new geometry
could be a description of physical space and it would henceforth be an
<em>empirical</em> task to decide whether Euclidean geometry or
non-Euclidean geometry was true. Lobachevskii even attempted to
determine the matter by astronomical observations, but there were
significant methodological difficulties and his results were utterly
inconclusive. Also Gauss, as the years went by, came to be entirely
confident that there was a new, two-dimensional geometry different
from Euclidean plane geometry (but he did not describe a
three-dimensional geometry of this kind, leaving open the possibility
that the two-dimensional geometry was some kind of formal oddity). In
correspondence with Bessel, Gauss made it clear that he could not
ascribe to Euclidean geometry the certainty he gave to
arithmetic&mdash;the latter was a priori, while the former should be
ranked with mechanics, as (partially at least) an empirical science
(Gauss <em>Werke</em> vol. 8, 177, 201). Both he and Bessel kept open
the possibility that astronomical regions of space might fail to be
Euclidean.</p>

<p>
It is, of course, true that no number of consistent deductions in the
new geometry rule out the possibility that a contradiction does exist,
but the intriguing relationship of the new geometry to spherical
geometry, and the existence of trigonometric formulae for triangles
strongly suggested that the new geometry was at least consistent. Many
geometers were to find the formulae convincing, even years later, for
example Enriques in his major essay (1907) on the principles of
geometry. It is not just that there are formulae, but that they hint
at an alternative formulation of geometry, in which Euclidean geometry
proves to be but a special case. Those who did accept it, and they
were very few before the 1860s, nonetheless might well have welcomed a
better account than the one Bolyai and Lobachevskii provided.</p>

<p>
If there could be another way to define geometry, one that would lead
to these formulae in various cases, the way would be open to rethink
all of the questions about geometry that critical examination had
opened. The person best placed to do this in the 1830s and 1840s was
Gauss: he knew very well what Bolyai and Lobachevskii had done, and
his differential geometry gave him the means to proceed, but,
curiously, he did not do so. In the early 1840s he wrote some notes
that show he could connect the new two-dimensional geometry with
geometry on a surface of constant negative curvature (the
pseudosphere), but he did nothing with this observation (Gauss,
<em>Werke</em>, vol. 8, 255&ndash;257).</p>

<p>
This need to give the formulae a sound geometrical grounding was
recognised by Lobachevskii in his earliest publications, but being in
Russian they were not read outside Russia (nor were they appreciated
by Russian mathematicians). He dropped his considerations of this kind
in his pamphlet of 1840, upon which much of his reputation depends to
this day, but brought them back in his last presentation, the
<em>Pang&eacute;om&eacute;trie</em> (1856), which, however, did no
better than the earlier versions.</p>

<p>
Lobachevskii argued firstly that geometry was a science of bodies in
space, and that space is three-dimensional. The most primitive concept
was that of contact, and its opposite, a cut separating two bodies.
Two bodies not in contact are separated and a suitable third body in
contact with both of them measures the distance between them&mdash;a
concept that was otherwise undefined. With it, however, he could
define a sphere with its centre at a given point as the collection of
all points equidistant from that given point. He then showed how to
define a plane capturing the intuition that a plane is the collection
of points in space that lie the same distance from two given points.
In his terms, given two points, a plane is the set of points common to
any two spheres of equal radius, one centred on one of the points and
the other on the other. A line can be defined similarly using circles
on the same plane.</p>

<p>
With the intuition that distance is the primitive concept comes a
greater appreciation of motion, or at least the results of being able
to move objects around without altering them. One can imagine
transporting a rigid body around, say, a cube with sides of unit
length, and using one of its sides to mark out lengths. We shall see
later that the possibilities inherent in this process occasioned a
chicken-and-egg debate between Bertrand Russell and Henri
Poincar&eacute; at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>
The new geometry posed a radical challenge to Euclidean geometry,
because it denied traditional geometry its best claim to certainty, to
wit, that it was the <em>only</em> logical system for discussing
geometry at all. It also exploited the tension known to experts
between the concepts of straightest and shortest. But in other ways it
was conventional. It offered no new definitions of familiar concepts
such as straightness or distance, it agreed with Euclidean geometry
over angles, it merely offered a different behaviour of parallel lines
based on a difference in the distant behaviour of straight lines. Its
proponents did not offer a sceptical conclusion. Bolyai and
Lobachevskii did not say: &ldquo;See, there are two logical but
incompatible geometries, so we can never know what is true.&rdquo;
Instead, they held out the hope that experiments and observations
would decide.</p>

<p>
The epistemological price people would have to pay if astronomical
observations had come down in favour of the new geometry would, in a
sense, have been slight: it would have been necessary to say that
straight lines have an unexpected property after all, but one only
detectable at very long distances. To be sure, many of the theorems of
geometry would then have to be reworked, and their familiar Euclidean
counterparts would appear only as very good approximations. But that
is broadly comparable to the situation Newtonian mechanics found
itself in after the advent of special relativity.</p>

<h2 id="RiemGeom">4. Riemannian geometry</h2>

<p>
The much more significant change came with the arrival of Bernhard
Riemann&rsquo;s great extension of Gaussian differential geometry.
Precisely, he found a way to define geometries starting from very
general concepts, and gradually leading (through more and more narrow
<em>hypotheses</em>) to the known metric geometries. At the risk of
sounding anachronistic, it can be argued that Riemann&rsquo;s
&ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; style of work is a form of
proto-structuralism. What he does is this: first, he introduces the
general structure of n-dimensional manifold, to then define a metric
in the manifold (with the means of differential geometry, line element
and Gaussian curvature). With all this in place, Euclidean and
non-Euclidean geometries emerge as particular cases of
three-dimensional manifolds, concrete forms of the general structure.
And the &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; that singles out these geometries,
within the general framework of Riemannian manifolds, is the physical
assumption that rigid bodies can move freely without deformation.</p>

<p>
Riemann&rsquo;s 1854 lecture &ldquo;&Uuml;ber die Hypothesen, welche
der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen&rdquo; was a tour-de-force at the
crossroads of mathematics, physics and philosophy. The paper is in
three parts, and he tells us himself that the first section is
philosophical (dealing with general notions about manifolds, the idea
of <em>analysis situs</em>, and the concept of dimension of a
manifold), the second mathematical (introduces differential geometry,
illustrates intrinsic geometry with some examples, and discusses
manifolds of constant curvature), the third physical (dealing with the
application to space, physical space, both in the large and the
small). The impact of this short and difficult paper, after
publication in 1868, can hardly be exaggerated.</p>

<h3 id="GausIntrGeom">4.1 Gauss and intrinsic geometry</h3>

<p>
Some of the epistemological issues are already raised with
Gauss&rsquo;s work (1828), so we turn to it first. Euler had shown
long before that, at each point <em>P</em> in a smooth surface, there
are two so-called <em>principal curvatures</em>, the maximum and the
minimum curvature of lines passing through <em>P</em>. These
curvatures, \(\kappa_{1}\) and \(\kappa_{2}\), occur in plane sections
perpendicular to each other and allow us to study the shape of the
entire neighborhood of <em>P</em>. Now, Gauss&rsquo;s deep idea (which
remarkably he found while working on geodesy, i.e., surveying and
mapmaking) was that some properties of curved surfaces can be studied
without regard for the ambient space. And one of these key properties
is the product \(\kappa_{1}\kappa_{2}\), called the Gaussian
<em>curvature</em> of the surface (at a point). Thus, employing
methods of differential analysis, he elaborated what is called an
<em>intrinsic</em> geometry of surfaces (intrinsic because the ambient
space is disregarded).</p>

<p>
Gauss worked with coordinate systems <em>within</em> the surface
itself, and considered the distance between points on the surface
<em>S</em> along lines contained entirely in <em>S</em>. Now, some
surfaces \(S_1\), \(S_2\) can be obtained from each other by bending
(without stretching); expressed more formally, there is an
<em>isometric</em> map from \(S_1\) to \(S_2\), which means that the
points on \(S_1\) are assigned points in \(S_2\) so that distances
within the surface \(S_1\) are the same as the distances of the
corresponding points in \(S_2\). (For instance, a plane can be so bent
to form a cylinder; you may use a piece of paper to convince
yourself.) And Gauss made the remarkable discovery that the Gaussian
curvature of a surface is an intrinsic property that remains invariant
under isometric mappings. He was so pleased with this result that he
called it <em>theorema egregium</em>, his &lsquo;outstanding
theorem&rsquo;: if two surfaces \(S_1\), \(S_2\) are isometric, then
corresponding points have the same Gaussian curvature.</p>

<p>
The fact that the Gaussian curvature of a surface at a point is
intrinsic means that it is entirely determined by measurements
<em>in</em> the surface and does not involve any question of a third
dimension or the ambient space embedding the surface. The property of
Gaussian curvature does not depend on how the surface is located in
space, but only on intrinsic properties of its metrics. That is to
say, important properties of curved surfaces remain invariant even if
one bends the surface isometrically (without breaking, stretching, or
folding it up). One such thing that remains invariant is the
<em>geodesics</em> on the surface, i.e., the lines of shortest
distance (lying entirely on the surface). In the case of a cylinder,
the geodesics are the vertical lines, horizontal lines (circles), and
helices around it &mdash;and these lines all come from straight lines
on the plane that is &lsquo;rolled up&rsquo; to form the cylinder.</p>

<p>
Given a metric, a differential formula for the distance <em>ds</em>
between neighboring points (which is everywhere the same), the
curvature can be found. If, for example, the formula for distance is
that for a map of the sphere on the plane, the curvature will be found
to be the reciprocal of the square of the radius of the sphere
\(1/R^2\). A plane has the same Gaussian curvature as a cylinder, or
also as something close to a cone (that one may form from a cylinder,
without breaking, stretching, or folding); they are locally isometric;
although curved, the cylinder has zero curvature in Gauss&rsquo;s
technical sense, just as does the plane, which is why printing from a
rotating drum is possible. Gauss investigated when one surface can be
mapped onto another in such a way that distances are not altered,
showing that a necessary condition for this to happen is that the
curvatures at corresponding points are the same. And this also implies
that the same figures can be constructed on all of these surfaces; the
minimal lines or curves of shortest length between two points
(geodesics) on one surface correspond to those on the others, so that
angles, areas, etc. will be the same. Gauss had found a deeper way to
look into the geometry of a surface, and this gave birth to modern
differential geometry.</p>

<p>
It was not immediately appreciated that Gauss&rsquo;s approach allowed
mathematicians to define surfaces as regions of the plane with a
particular metric that are not to be obtained from surfaces in
Euclidean three-dimensional space. If one defines a surface as the
image of a map from a piece of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}^3\),
then of course it is in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). But if one defines a surface
as a region of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with a particular metric, then there
may be no surface in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to which it corresponds. The
first person to appreciate this seems to have been Riemann, who also
extended this idea to any number of dimensions.</p>

<h3 id="RiemGene">4.2 Riemann&rsquo;s generalisation</h3>

<p>
Riemann&rsquo;s ideas in his 1854 paper were both profound and
na&iuml;ve, and for that reason they proved difficult to make precise,
but we can content ourselves with being na&iuml;ve initially. He
supposed he was given a space (he called it a &lsquo;manifold&rsquo;)
in which one can at any point impose a coordinate system at least on
all points near to an arbitrary initial point, and if \(n\) numbers
are needed to specify the location of a point he said that the space
is \(n\)-dimensional. We can think of this process as providing a map
of at least that part of the space near the initial point onto
\(\mathbb{R}^n\). Riemann was very aware of the difference between
local and global determinations, and this became one of the keys to
his new ideas: the same local conditions are compatible with numerous
different global configurations.</p>

<p>
He then supposed there was a means of saying what the distance was
infinitesimally, by generalising the formula for \(ds\) from 2 to
\(n\) variables. (He even allowed that entirely different formulae be
used, but we shall not describe that part of his theory, which lay
fallow for many years.) Next, he generalized the intrinsic property of
curvature to higher dimensions; essentially, the \(n\)-dimensional
object has lots of 2-dimensional surfaces to which the Gaussian theory
applies, so a notion of curvature of a \(n\)-dimensional object at a
point can be derived from a consideration of the 2-dimensional
surfaces that pass through the point.</p>

<p>
There are properties of the space that are independent of the
coordinate system. If two different coordinate systems give out
different coordinates, but in such a way that the distance between the
points is preserved, then either system gives us the same geometry,
and we find that the two agree on the curvatures at each point, on
distances, and so forth. Yet the framework of differential geometry
proposed by Riemann is very flexible and general. He found that it
allowed not only for alternatives to Euclidean geometry, but even for
geometries where the generalized curvature does change from point to
point. Initially this was scarcely taken up, and most authors focused
on geometries of <em>constant curvature</em>. As Riemann explained,
his framework allowed for geometries of negative curvature (this is
the Lobachevskii-Bolyai case), of positive curvature (a new kind,
often called elliptic geometry, or &lsquo;Riemannian&rsquo; in a
narrow sense), and also of zero curvature (Euclidean).</p>

<p>
Because the formula for \(ds\) was written down subject to only a few
restrictions, there is no reason to believe that a Riemannian geometry
is defined with respect to an antecedent Euclidean geometry. There is
no claim that an \(n\)-dimensional Riemannian geometry is to be
obtained by a map from an \(n\)-dimensional subset of some Euclidean
\(m\)-dimensional space. This means that geometry can be done without
reference to any Euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry is no longer
epistemologically prior to any study of other geometries. The reign of
Euclid was&mdash;theoretically&mdash;over.</p>

<p>
Given a concept of distance on a manifold it is possible to talk about
geodesics&mdash;a geodesic being a curve of shortest length between
two points. Existence and uniqueness questions can be raised, and
often answered. A significant advance was made independently by Tullio
Levi-Civita in 1917 and Hermann Weyl in 1918, inspired by
Einstein&rsquo;s theory of General Relativity, when they showed how to
define parallelism on a curved manifold (on Levi-Civita&rsquo;s
contribution, see Bottazzini 1999; on Weyl&rsquo;s contribution see
Scholz 2001). Roughly speaking, in Weyl&rsquo;s presentation (1918),
two vectors at different points are parallel if they belong to a
family of vectors along a curve that do not vary along the curve. This
became referred to as a way of establishing a connection between
different points, and the theory was called the theory of connections
on manifolds. One can ask if a family of tangent vectors to a curve is
composed of vectors parallel to the tangent vector at the starting
point: if so, the curve is a natural candidate to be considered the
straightest curve between its end points, because the tangent vector
never accelerates along the curve. In modern differential geometry,
geodesics are defined via connections.</p>

<h3 id="RiemBeltRigoNonEuclGeom">4.3 Riemann and Beltrami and rigorous non-Euclidean geometry</h3>

<p>
Riemann&rsquo;s &ldquo;&Uuml;ber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie
zu Grunde liegen&rdquo; (given as a lecture in 1854, published
posthumously in 1868) and Beltrami&rsquo;s &ldquo;Saggio di
interpretazione della geometria non-euclidea&rdquo; (1868) gave
different but equivalent accounts of two-dimensional non-Euclidean
geometry. Beltrami employed differential geometry to justify the
hyperbolic geometry of Lobachevskii-Bolyai. By studying the
pseudosphere and how it can be mapped onto the plane (in such a way
that its geodesics went to straight lines), Beltrami realized that the
unit disk can be viewed as an &lsquo;infinite plane&rsquo;. It had
been impossible to find a surface in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) that behaved
like the hyperbolic plane (the closest, but partial, being the
pseudosphere); now it was possible to realize non-Euclidean geometry
as the geometry of the interior of a disk with a novel metric. The
disk is the whole &lsquo;plane&rsquo;, its circumference a line at
infinity, line segments in the disk are &lsquo;lines&rsquo;, and one
can define a distance function \(d(P,Q)\) that makes sense and
validates Lobachevskii&rsquo;s results. From the logical point of
view, this was an enormous step forward, as the consistency of
non-Euclidean geometry was now proven.</p>

<p>
Riemann&rsquo;s account, which was stated in \(n\) dimensions, agrees
with the one that Poincar&eacute; was to use in many short
publications in 1880 and 1881 but only describe explicitly in his
major paper &ldquo;Th&eacute;orie des groupes fuchsiens&rdquo;
(Poincar&eacute; 1882). In this so-called <em>conformal</em> model,
the plane is again a disk, geodesics are arcs of circles perpendicular
to the boundary of the disk and angles are true (Euclidean). The
Riemann and Beltrami disks swiftly persuaded mathematicians that the
non-Euclidean geometry of Bolyai and Lobachevskii did, after all, make
rigorous mathematical sense. Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s contribution a
decade later was to make non-Euclidean geometry the natural geometry
for certain topics elsewhere in mathematics, chiefly the developing
and important subject of Riemann surfaces.</p>

<p>
The importance of a rigorous account of any part of mathematics should
not be ignored, but the acceptance of non-Euclidean and Riemannian
geometries went beyond the presentation of a consistent formalism. It
marks the acceptance of the abstract view that geometry is whatever
can be described in the Riemannian formalism: one has a very general
framework, allowing for a dizzying number of concrete specifications.
Thus the door was opened to the view that there are many geometries,
each of which must be consistent, and none of which need to refer to
Euclidean space, however intuitive this may be. (A parallel
development with similar outcome happened in the context of projective
geometry with Klein&rsquo;s work.) The number of dimensions of the
&lsquo;space&rsquo; under discussion, and the precise metric can be
modified at will (in due course, the topological character of that
&lsquo;space&rsquo; would be treated similarly). There is a
two-dimensional geometry of such-and-such a kind because a suitable
metric can be found; because there is, as it were, a map of it, not
because a surface has been found in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with the right
properties. Indeed, it was later shown (Hilbert 1901) that there is no
surface in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) corresponding precisely to non-Euclidean
two-dimensional space.</p>

<p>
Riemann was clear that the epistemological implications of this way of
doing geometry were immense. His lecture was a happy combination of
mathematics, philosophy and physics (Ferreir&oacute;s 2006).
Mathematicians should no longer need to abstract some fundamental
intuitions from what they believe about physical space, such as the
nature and properties of straight lines or circles, and seek to build
a true geometry on the basis of some axiomatic expression of those
intuitions. Rather, the direction of thought should go in the opposite
direction: mathematicians were free to consider infinitely many
geometries. Riemann speculated about the validity of the hypotheses of
geometry &ldquo;in the infinitely small&rdquo; being possibly bound up
with the physical forces. Scientists could now freely investigate
which geometry is best for the mathematical explanation of empirical
facts. He envisioned the abandonment of the Newtonian conception of
phenomena, &ldquo;by making in this conception the successive changes
required by facts which it cannot explain&rdquo;. His purely
conceptual (mathematical) research would be useful &ldquo;in
preventing this work from being hampered by too narrow views, and
progress in knowledge of the interdependence of things from being
checked by traditional prejudices&rdquo;. In this connection, it was
soon shown that it is possible to do theoretical mechanics in the
setting of non-Euclidean geometry.</p>

<h2 id="InteNewGeom">5. The intelligibility of the new geometries</h2>

<p>
The epistemological significance of projective geometry rests on its
implications for the nature and rigour of classical geometry. As we
have seen, it provided the context in which the modern axiomatic style
would be developed (to be sure, with inputs from other contributions,
e.g., the rigorous study of the number systems, like the real numbers,
the complex numbers, and the algebraic numbers). The epistemological
significance of non-Euclidean geometry rests more on the possibility
that it could be true in whatever way that Euclidean geometry could be
true. We therefore turn to 19<sup>th</sup>-century examinations of the
intelligibility of geometry.</p>

<p>
But first a word of warning. The logical fact that non-Euclidean
geometry turned out to be consistent (relative to Euclidean geometry,
or to real analysis) does not per se establish the invalidity of the
Kantian viewpoint. A sophisticated elaboration of such a standpoint
was Frege&rsquo;s (see below and the entry on the
 <a href="../frege-hilbert/">Frege-Hilbert controversy</a>).
 But it&rsquo;s true that most of the relevant authors chose a
different line of thought and abandoned the Kantian position.</p>

<h3 id="GausHerbRiem">5.1 Gauss, Herbart, and Riemann</h3>

<p>
Johann Friedrich Herbart was Kant&rsquo;s successor in K&ouml;nigsberg
in 1808, but he was no orthodox Kantian &ndash; he rejected both the
doctrine of categories, and the notion of a priori forms of intuition,
employing the history of science for their critique. In 1833 he
followed a call to the famous University of G&ouml;ttingen. His major
work, the two-volume <em>Psychologie als Wissenschaft neu gegrundet
auf Erfahrung, Metaphysik, und Mathematik</em> (1824&ndash;1825),
sought to establish psychology as a science, based on experience and
metaphysics. Using some rather fanciful mathematics he endeavoured to
show how memory works and how repeated stimuli of certain kinds cause
the mind to learn to perceive, for example, lines, parallel lines,
intersecting lines, and surfaces. There are no innate ideas, in
Herbart&rsquo;s opinion, and visual space is constructed from
experience.</p>

<p>
Herbart&rsquo;s ideas influenced Riemann (see Scholz 1982), but in
notes he wrote for himself Riemann said that he agreed with Herbart in
matters of psychology and epistemology, but not his ontology nor his
ideas about the source of continuity. The disagreement masks a deeper
sympathy, as Herbart promoted the idea that there is a conceptual act
of inferring continuity among the instances of concepts (colour was
his favorite example). Riemann agreed that some concepts, at least,
have a class of instances that is continuous: a continuous
manifold.</p>

<p>
Riemann regarded natural science as the attempt to understand nature
by the use of precise concepts, which are to be modified in the light
of new experiences. It was their origin in observation or experiment
that gave these concepts their significance for science, but Riemann
allowed for a constant process of reflection, reconception, and then
corroboration. There are no pure &ldquo;facts&rdquo; in science, since
our statements always hide some hypothetical assumptions &ndash; hence
his talk of the &ldquo;hypotheses&rdquo; at the basis of geometry.
Around 1860, the word &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; was understood to imply
truth <em>simpliciter</em>, and apparently it was for this reason that
Riemann avoided it, as it contradicted his epistemological standpoint.
He expected the most successful concepts to be quite abstract, and
agreed with Herbart that they are not a priori in the Kantian
fashion.</p>

<p>
Riemann was making conscious what Herbart had said occurred naturally:
if intellectual reflection generates concepts with which we frame the
world, in reaction to our experiences, then, said Riemann, let
mathematics generate more precise and flexible concepts with which to
conduct science. At the end of his lecture he explored possibilities
for the application of the new geometries, especially at an atomic
level, and he argued that his task had been to expand the range of
theoretical options, eliminating prejudices handed down to us by
tradition.</p>

<p>
The physicist Wilhelm Weber once wrote that, with Gauss and Riemann,
G&ouml;ttingen had become &ldquo;the plantation of the most profoundly
philosophical orientation in mathematical research&rdquo; (quote in
Ferreir&oacute;s 2006, 67). Some of Riemann&rsquo;s ideas indeed have
clear antecedents in Gauss, thus e.g. his conviction that there was
room for a new science of topology, the qualitative analysis of
relations between regions of space. Gauss saw this as related to the
complex numbers and their &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo;, and also to the
basic ideas of differential geometry. In a letter, Gauss comments that
the topic of his 1828 &ldquo;Disquisitiones generales&rdquo;,
discussed above, &ldquo;takes us to an unpredictable level&rdquo;,
being &ldquo;profoundly interconnected with much more, I would say
with the metaphysics of space&rdquo; (<em>Werke</em>, vol. 12, 8). Two
other ideas that link Gauss and his doctoral student are the empirical
component of Euclidean geometry, and the possibility of transcending
the traditional three dimensions of space.</p>

<p>
Gauss conceived arithmetic to be a priori knowledge, but became
convinced that geometry (i.e., the theory of space) has empirical
content, at least partly; &ldquo;we must humbly acknowledge that space
has a <em>reality outside</em> our minds, and we cannot prescribe its
laws completely a priori&rdquo;. It seems that he was closer to Kant
as regards some more basic features of space, like
three-dimensionality. To believe some reports, Gauss viewed the
restriction to three dimensions as an innate characteristic of our
minds, and speculated that in another life we may perceive more
dimensions &ndash; he joked saying he had left some difficult problems
for the afterlife. He also suggested the idea of beings living on a
surface, later employed by Abbott for his novel <em>Flatland.</em></p>

<p>
Up until his death, those ideas remained private knowledge, shared by
the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; of those who were close to the famous
mathematician, but they became public with the edition of his
correspondence in the 1860s. This helped reinforce the great impact of
the publication of Riemann&rsquo;s lecture, in 1868.</p>

<h3 id="HelmPoin">5.2 Helmholtz and Poincar&eacute;</h3>

<p>
Riemann&rsquo;s ideas in turn influenced Hermann von Helmholtz, who
published some influential essays on how our knowledge of space and
geometry is possible. Initially motivated by his studies on the
physiology of vision, Helmholtz endeavoured to show how only a limited
number of geometries can be constructed in which there is a concept of
rigid body motion. Interestingly, where Riemann talked about
&lsquo;hypotheses&rsquo;, Helmholtz&rsquo;s title referred to
&ldquo;the <em>factual </em>foundations of geometry&rdquo;
(&ldquo;&Uuml;ber die tats&auml;chlichen Grundlagen der
Geometrie&rdquo;, 1868), making explicit a key difference in their
views. He argued that our experience of spatial measurements is based
on the congruence of rigid bodies, and that teaches us what space is
like.</p>

<p>
Helmholtz tried to show that the requirement of free mobility of rigid
bodies, without deformation, ultimately implies that the geometry of
space is Euclidean. Thus he claimed that a two-dimensional space that
complies with the &ldquo;Axiom of Free Mobility&rdquo; would either be
the Euclidean plane or the sphere (infinite extension would then
decide for Euclid). But Beltrami wrote to him to point out that he had
overlooked the possibility of Lobachevskian (non-Euclidean) geometry,
and Helmholtz agreed, coming to the same conclusion as Riemann had
before him (see the entry on
 <a href="../hermann-helmholtz/">Helmholtz</a>).</p>
 
<p>
This gave rise to the so-called &ldquo;problem of space&rdquo;, which
Sophus Lie solved on the basis of his theory of groups. Indeed, the
requirement of free mobility (in the improved version that Lie
employed) constrained the options to the known geometries of constant
curvature. This was dealt with in Lie&rsquo;s <em>Theorie der
Transformationsgruppen</em> (1888), vol. 1.</p>

<p>
Helmholtz&rsquo;s 1868 paper, and another &ldquo;&Uuml;ber den
Ursprung und die Bedeutung der geometrischen Axiome&rdquo; (1870,
&ldquo;On the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of
Geometry&rdquo;), would be highly influential. In this further essay
Helmholtz explained how it would be possible for us to have knowledge
of Lobachevskii&rsquo;s geometry at an intuitive level &ndash; to
actually visualize it. He was thus trying to give the lie to followers
of Kant, with their insistence on &lsquo;visualizability&rsquo;
(<em>Anschaulichkeit</em>) as the core element of mathematics. Many
Kantians refused to be convinced, but one person that these ideas (and
Riemann&rsquo;s) very likely influenced was Henri Poincar&eacute; (see
Gray 2012).</p>

<p>
As soon as Poincar&eacute; began to write his popular philosophical
essays about geometry, he made it clear that his chief concern was
with how we could rely on any geometry at all. Mathematical advances
were the basis for his reflections, but the key question was about the
epistemological status of the hypotheses on which geometry is founded.
And here he could not agree with Kant, nor Helmholtz, nor with
Riemann. He was well aware of the great range of Riemannian
geometries, and of the conclusion of Helmholtz&rsquo;s speculations,
by then made rigorous in the work of Sophus Lie. His concern in his
&ldquo;On the Foundations of Geometry&rdquo; (1898) was with
epistemology.</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute; argued that the mind quickly realises that it can
compensate for certain kinds of motions that we see. If a glass comes
towards you, you can walk backwards in such a way that the glass seems
unaltered. You can do the same if it tilts or rotates. We come to
master a store of these compensating motions, and we realise that we
can follow one with another and the result will be a third
compensating motion. On this basis we come to distinguish
displacements (both our bodily displacements and displacements of
objects) from other kinds of change, i.e., alterations for which we
cannot generate compensating motions, such as the motion of the wine
in the glass as it swirls around, or a change in its colour. Most
importantly, the displacements have the mathematical structure of a
group. In this way the mind comes to form the concept of a rigid body
motion, and we elaborate a clear conceptual understanding of space on
the basis of the group of motions.</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute; then considered what group the group of compensating
motions could be, and found that, as Lie had proved in his study of
the Riemann-Helmholtz problem of space, there was a strictly limited
collection of such groups. Chief among them were the groups that come
from Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and as abstract groups they
are different. But which one was correct?</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s controversial view was that one could never
know, or better, than none was simply &ldquo;true&rdquo;. Human
beings, through evolution and through our experience as infants, pick
the Euclidean group and so we say that space is Euclidean. Our bodies
are quite rigid, our motions are (approximately) rigid motions, and
this is decisive. Another species, drawing on different experiences,
could pick the non-Euclidean group and so say that space was
non-Euclidean. If we met such a species, there would be no experiment
that would decide the issue for both parties.</p>

<p>
Of course, one can make experiments using large triangles and
measuring the angles, as Lobachevskii, Riemann and others had
suggested. To maximize dimensions, assume that the sides of the
triangle are made by rays of light. Now, suppose that within the
limits of experimental error the result of the experiment is that the
angle sum of the triangle is less than 180&deg;, a result consistent
with non-Euclidean geometry but inconsistent with Euclidean geometry.
The only conclusion one can draw, said Poincar&eacute;, is that either
light rays travel along straight lines and space is non-Euclidean, or
that space is Euclidean and light rays travel along curves.</p>

<p>
We can summarise his argument (1898) this way. Our knowledge of the
geometry of the external world is founded on our basic physical
experiences, which lead to our mental ability to deal with a group of
rigid body motions. There is a very limited store of these groups, but
no experiment can decide between them. Yet he must make a choice, and
we shall choose the simplest one. As it happens, that was the
Euclidean group, because we found that one of its properties not
shared with the non-Euclidean group (corresponding to the parallel
postulate) was particularly simple. This viewpoint is
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s philosophy of geometrical
<em>conventionalism</em>. Because of the way knowledge is acquired and
the fact that there is more than one appropriate group, one can never
know whether space is Euclidean or non-Euclidean, only that we
construct it as Euclidean.</p>

<p>
This twist on the Kantian doctrine of the unknowability of the
<em>Ding an sich</em> (the thing in itself) and our confinement to the
world of appearances, was congenial to Poincar&eacute; as a working
physicist. Even though he agreed with Riemann to a large extent,
Riemann had hoped that empirical matters would guide the choice of
geometry, while Poincar&eacute; could not agree. But there is an
important distinction to make, regarding his philosophy of
conventionalism. Notice that this is not like the conventionality of
words, but rather more like social or legal conventions: the choice of
words (whether &lsquo;water&rsquo; or &lsquo;agua&rsquo;) is highly
arbitrary, but with legal conventions, some basic facts and conditions
have to be taken into account (see De Paz 2018). The situation is far
from arbitrariness, also in the case of geometry, since physical
experience plays a decisive role restricting the choice; but there is
no absolute determination either, in the end a convention has to be
made, and simplicity has the final word.</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute; advocated conventionalism in other areas of science
too, arguing that what we call the laws of nature (Newton&rsquo;s
laws, e.g., the principle of inertia) are neither empirical matters
open to revision nor absolute truths, but are well established results
that have been elevated to the role of axioms in present scientific
theories. They could be challenged, but only if a whole scientific
theory was being challenged, not idly when some awkward observations
were made. Faced with a satellite that did not seem to be obeying
Newton&rsquo;s laws one should, said Poincar&eacute;, consider some
as-yet unnoticed force at work and not seek to rewrite Newton. But a
new theory can be proposed, based on different assumptions that
rewrite a law of nature, because these laws are not eternal
truths&mdash;we could never know such things. And if a new law were to
be proposed, simplicity and not only empirical fit will be taken into
account as one chooses between the new and the old.</p>

<p>
The crucial distinction here is that scientific conventionalism
operates at a high level. The choices are made consciously and
intellectually, the debate is only open to people with a considerable
amount of specialised education. On the other hand, the choice of
Euclidean geometry operates in the mind before it is capable of any
kind of formal instruction; without <em>some</em> geometric framework,
the unfortunate subject would be incapable of any knowledge of the
external world.</p>

<h3 id="PoinVersRuss">5.3 Poincar&eacute; versus Russell</h3>

<p>
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s views brought him into collision with Bertrand
Russell in the 1890s when Russell was emerging from his brief Hegelian
phase and entering his Kantian phase. Russell was trying to establish
the Kantian a priori by arguing that there is one fundamental
geometry, projective geometry, and we have synthetic a priori
knowledge of it (see Griffin 1991 on Russell, and Nabonnand 2000 or
Gray 2008, 77&ndash;82, on the controversy).</p>

<p>
There can be little doubt that Poincar&eacute;, with his much greater
command of mathematics, won much of the debate, as Russell was
(characteristically) willing to concede. But a significant difference
of approach between them was never to be resolved.
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s analysis began with rigid bodies and their
motions, from which a concept of distance is created. Russell (1897)
argued on the contrary, that whatever we may discover the concept of
distance to be, we know before we begin that the distance from London
to Paris is more than a metre. This Poincar&eacute; denied
(Poincar&eacute; 1899).</p>

<p>
In Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s view, we only know the distance from one
point to another on the basis of experience with rigid bodies, and
this knowledge has become innate in us. In Russell&rsquo;s view,
distance is to be regarded as a fundamental intuition, and if some
contemplated that the distance from London to Paris could be less than
a metre, we would know they could not be talking about distance. But
Poincar&eacute; insisted that talk of what we know should always be
dependent on how we know it; without that, the claims are not
knowledge claims at all.</p>

<p>
A mathematical illustration may illuminate the disagreement. For
Poincar&eacute;, the sense of space and ordinary geometry, that we
have prior to advanced instruction, is really about our ability to
measure things. We can carry a rigid body around, and use it as a
ruler; that is why we can speak of the distance between places. If you
want to make the set-up more abstract, there must be a space and a
group that acts on the space and moves points in the space around. If
this group has the property that however a region of space is moved
around it is never mapped onto a proper subset of itself, then one can
construct rigid bodies and talk about distance.</p>

<p>
For Russell, one is free to take a space and assign a
&lsquo;distance&rsquo; to each pair of points (subject to some simple
conditions which we omit). Relative to this sense of distance, one can
say whether, as a region is moved around, points in it remain the same
distance apart or not. We have done this for our sense of distance on
the surface of the Earth, and we can do this whether or not we also
have some rigid body motions. In mathematical terms, Russell would be
happy with what is called a metric space. The point is not that one
could impose a weird metric on the surface of the Earth (in which a
particular pair of points, say in Cambridge, were two metres apart and
London and Paris were only a metre apart&mdash;one could) but that one
can talk about distance without presupposing the action of a group.
Some metric spaces admit the action of groups that preserve distance,
others do not, but distance can be defined without talking about a
group.</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute; was never confronted with exactly this
argument&mdash;metric spaces are an invention of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century&mdash;but we know what he would have said. He would have said
that it was valid mathematics but entirely formal and could not be
considered as genuine knowledge because it lacked a
&lsquo;psychophysical&rsquo;, i.e., physiological dimension. We know
this because it was his criticism of the axiomatic geometries
constructed by Hilbert.</p>

<p>
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s arguments also met with objections from the
Italian mathematician Federigo Enriques. Poincar&eacute; had argued
that one way to see the validity of the geometrical conventionalist
argument was to consider a disc in which everything was made of the
same material, which expanded under the effect of some
&lsquo;force&rsquo;, and in which the force was a particular function
of the distance of the centre of the disc. This function, which
Poincar&eacute; specified, ensured that the metric in the disc, as
measured by rods made of the same material as the disc, was that of
non-Euclidean geometry. Creatures living in the disc would report that
their space was non-Euclidean; we would reply that their space was
Euclidean but subject to the distorting effect of a temperature field.
Plainly each side can maintain their position free of
self-contradiction.</p>

<p>
Enriques argued, in his book <em>Problemi della scienza</em> (1906),
that this was unreasonable. The creatures would be right to ascribe a
geometry to their space (and, indeed, non-Euclidean geometry) because
the distorting force is beyond their control. Their geodesics are
built into the space, and it would be unreasonable of them to ascribe
the paths of geodesics to the operation of a &lsquo;force&rsquo;
because that &lsquo;force&rsquo; was not something they could even in
principle manipulate. Heat, the gravitational effect of massive
objects, these distorting influences are things that can be allowed
for, because they change and can be experienced. If, in the experiment
above, it were to be claimed that space is Euclidean but our
candidates for light rays are deformed, it should be possible to vary
the degree of deformation. One might conduct the experiment further
away from any massive objects, in emptier regions of space. If
different experiments gave slightly different results one would, in
accordance with Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s own criteria for changing
scientific conventions, look for something in the circumstances that
was responsible for the deviation of the light rays from straightness.
But if no experiment were to show any difference, Enriques argued that
it would be rational to conclude that light rays travelled on
geodesics and the geometry of space was non-Euclidean.</p>

<p>
It is worth noticing that the growing sophistication of ideas about
how theoretical geometry relates to practical experience, and about
the nature of the knowledge that geometry supplies, belong to a family
of changes across all of mathematics by 1900. An autonomous discipline
of mathematics emerged that placed an increasing emphasis on formal
aspects of the subject and offered a complicated and often distant
relationship with the world of experience. This modernist turn in
mathematics is discussed in various places (see Gray 2008 and the
literature cited there).</p>

<h3 id="FregBeyo">5.4 Frege and beyond</h3>

<p>
After the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, Kant&rsquo;s claims for
the synthetic a priori status of Euclidean geometry as a description
of physical space came into question. Their denial, however, was not a
necessary conclusion, as Kant&rsquo;s views are compatible with the
existence of logical alternatives to Euclidean geometry. After all, he
was arguing about space as an intuition, not about pure conceptual
possibilities; he was not a Leibnizian, and denied that geometry is
analytic. If anything, a Kantian would expect that the alternative
geometries are only an intellectual possibility, and that we cannot
visualize them intuitively.</p>

<p>
Such a position was adopted by many intellectuals in the late
19<sup>th</sup> century. They can be regarded as the
&ldquo;Boeotians&rdquo; (here meaning: dull, obtuse people) whose
uproar Gauss feared. An example was R. H. Lotze, a highly regarded
philosopher working at G&ouml;ttingen, who called those who proposed
spaces of four or five dimensions &lsquo;scientific freaks&rsquo;, and
insisted (according to F. Klein&rsquo;s reminiscences) that
&ldquo;non-Euclidean geometry is nonsense&rdquo;. Other philosophers
who endorsed comparable viewpoints are the great psychologist W. Wundt
and the French Neokantian C. Renouvier (see Torretti 1978, chapter 4).
(Also see Richards 1988, Lorenat 2022.)</p>

<p>
But in fact, the Kantian position could be defended without any
obtuseness. This was the case with Frege. In his <em>Foundations of
Arithmetic</em> (1884: &sect; 14), Frege was explicit that geometric
truths are valid &ldquo;for the whole domain of the spatially
intuitive (<em>des</em> <em>r&auml;umlich Anschaulichen</em>)&rdquo;,
be it actual (real) or a mere product of the imagination. The craziest
phantasies, insofar as they display visualizable situations, are
subject to the axioms of Euclidean geometry. But Frege did not deny
the possibility of a logical system incompatible with Euclid&rsquo;s
tenets. He added that conceptual thinking can go beyond them, for
instance when it admits a space of four dimensions, or a positive
measure of curvature. Yet, the only space that is visualizable or can
be intuited, is Euclidean space; only of its structure do we have an
intuition, only its principles are true.</p>

<p>
This of course can be criticized, because our intuitions may not be so
absolutely precise. For instance, Klein insisted on the central
importance of intuition in mathematics, but his notion of intuition
was not Kantian (see e.g. Klein 1895, 179, or Klein 1909). He is
talking about knowledge of particulars, which grows and modifies with
experience of a subject matter, but which is always affected by
inexactness. This last feature distances Klein from Kant (and Frege)
decisively. In Klein&rsquo;s view, the precise concepts of mathematics
are always the product of an idealisation, and the raw images of
intuition can be idealised in more than one way (Biagioli 2020). Our
intuitive ideas seem to privilege the Euclidean axiom of parallels,
but in effect the imprecise experience we have with straight lines is
restricted to finite regions of space and finite discrimination
&ndash; thus being far from the astronomically large and the
atomically small. As a result, both Euclidean and non-Euclidean
geometries are admissible idealisations. This line of thought
influenced philosophers such as Ernst Cassirer (1910).</p>

<p>
Frege saw that Riemann&rsquo;s differential geometry, or
<em>n</em>-dimensional spaces, are perfectly admissible as pure
mathematics. He also understood Hilbert&rsquo;s axiomatic standpoint,
and explained it more clearly than Hilbert himself (as of 1900) in
their correspondence. But it conflicted with his epistemological
views. In his view, Kant was right stating that the source of the
truth of geometric axioms is intuition or visual grasp
(<em>Anschauung</em>). The possibility that we have of denying an
axiom, without contradiction, shows that the axioms are independent of
each other, and of the basic logical laws &ndash; hence they are
synthetic. This is not the case for the principles of arithmetic. He
emphatically affirmed the existence of geometric <em>truths</em>, most
notably in this famous passage of &ldquo;Der Gedanke&rdquo;
(1918):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A third realm must be recognized. Anything belonging to this realm has
it in common with ideas that it cannot be perceived by the senses, but
has it in common with things that it does not need an owner so as to
belong to the contents of his consciousness. Thus for example the
thought we have expressed in the Pythagorean theorem is timelessly
true, true independently of whether anyone takes it to be true. It
needs no owner. It is not true only from the time when it is
discovered; just as a planet, even before anyone saw it, was in
interaction with other planets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From the point of view of mathematics, Frege was on the losing side;
his views have been minority in the 20th century. Perhaps many
scientists would agree with his emphasis on truth <em>simpliciter</em>
for the limited domain of arithmetic, but certainly not for geometry.
Hilbert&rsquo;s geometric work (and other structuralist contributions,
before and after) deflated the idea of mathematical truth; the notion
of &lsquo;axiom&rsquo; was profoundly transformed; moreover, Einstein
and General Relativity decisively inclined the balance.</p>

<p>
Yet, there is an interesting &ldquo;problem of space&rdquo; as regards
the psychological evidence of Euclid&rsquo;s geometry, or perhaps
better, as regards its cognitive roots and its strength. This can be
regarded as a contemporary version of some of the questions
investigated traditionally by Herbart, Helmholtz, Mach,
Poincar&eacute;, and others. Relevant for this cognitive &ldquo;space
problem&rdquo; are several recent studies in the field of mathematical
cognition (e.g. Giaquinto 2007, Mumma 2010, Dehaene &amp; Brannon
2011, van der Ham et al. 2017), and one can imagine ways in which
comparative history of mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics,
could contribute to investigating such a problem. This seems to be a
question for future years.</p>

<h2 id="ConcRema">6. Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>
The history of geometry, and of the idea of space, is extremely
intricate, covering as it does the whole span of human history. To
give just an example, the notion of space as a whole (not location)
emerged rather late, in the Renaissance, and even during the period we
have covered it was primarily associated with physical space (see
L&uuml;tzen 2023). We have made no attempt to consider mathematical or
physical developments in the 20th and 21st century, which would
include new ideas emerging from topology and algebraic geometry, all
the way up to topos theory.</p>

<p>
This essay has examined the main branches in the development of
geometry until the early years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century under
the headings of theoretical or abstract knowledge, empirical and other
analyses of the intelligibility of such knowledge, and the deductive
character of that knowledge (including the role of figures or
diagrams).</p>

<p>
The dual nature of the straight line in elementary Euclidean geometry
as both the shortest curve joining any two of its points and as the
curve that points always in the same direction was disentangled. One
line of enquiry led to geometries that emphasised straightness as the
fundamental property (typically, projective geometry) and the other to
geometries that emphasised the property of being the shortest. The
former approach was seen from the start as a non-metrical one, and
became the favoured arena for formal, even axiomatic investigations of
geometry as a deductive enterprise. The price (as Poincar&eacute;
observed) was having less and less to say about physical space. The
concept of geometry was radically enlarged, but in ways that were not
intended to be accounts of experiential space.</p>

<p>
The metrical account led to progressive elucidation of a significant
obscurity in Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>: the parallel postulate.
For much of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, non-Euclidean geometries
(like Lobachevskii&rsquo;s) were the only alternative to
Euclid&rsquo;s that was proposed as an intelligible geometry, even
though it was generally agreed that only the most delicate experiments
could hope to decide the matter. Mathematically and conceptually,
Riemann&rsquo;s contribution stands out as epoch-making.
Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s contested view was that no experiment could so
decide, and this raised important issues about the way abstract terms
are to be interpreted and the role of hypotheses in scientific
theory.</p>

<p>
Beyond the eye-catching and thought-provoking idea of a physical
geometry alternative to Euclid&rsquo;s system, which had stood for two
thousand years, there was the panoply of metrical geometries hinted at
in work on differential geometry by Gauss and above all by Riemann.
Here it finally proved possible to explain the relationship between
straightest and shortest in a suitably general setting. It also became
possible to discuss geometry as a body of ideas that grew out of naive
notions of length, angle, shape, and size, and to do so in a
sophisticated and rigorous way. What had been regarded as inescapable
axiomatic truths, necessary truths, now became hypothetical
assumptions that could be modified in many ways; the old notion of an
axiom yielded gradually to the modern one.</p>

<p>
It was also possible to contemplate all kinds of theoretical
structures as &lsquo;spaces&rsquo;, whether or not they were presented
axiomatically or intended as distillations of intelligible experience.
In this way, it became possible to apply geometrical ideas in novel
settings and in novel ways. Geometrisation has been ubiquitous in
maths and science ever since.</p>

<p>
After 1900, it was clear that Euclidean geometry had lost its
pre-eminent position. This ancient system lost its certainty, and
there were better formal, axiomatic systems, such as those proposed by
Hilbert and some mathematicians in the school around Peano. There were
rich systems that were more fundamental, in the sense of using fewer
properties of the figures of traditional geometry such as the straight
line (the many versions of projective geometry). And there was a
profusion of metrical geometries with more natural starting points and
deeper theories.</p>

<p>
As a result, ideas about how theoretical geometry of whatever kind
relates to the space around us had become much more sophisticated.
From the standpoint of pure mathematics, the situation was one of
pluralism. The &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of geometric principles was no
longer to be taken for granted, notoriously the Kantian viewpoint was
generally abandoned. Choosing a physical geometry had become, in some
measure, an empirical question &mdash;if we assume Poincar&eacute; was
not right. Philosophical ideas about the intelligibility of geometry
had also deepened. Perhaps also from the standpoint of general science
one ought to consider a pluralistic outlook.</p>
