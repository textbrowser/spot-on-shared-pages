<h1>Thick Ethical Concepts</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Sep 21, 2016; substantive revision Tue Jan 21, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Evaluative terms and concepts are often divided into
&ldquo;thin&rdquo; and &ldquo;thick&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t evaluate
actions and persons merely as good or bad, or right or wrong, but also
as kind, courageous, tactful, selfish, boorish, and cruel. The latter
are examples of thick concepts, the general class of which includes
virtue and vice concepts such as generous and selfish, practical
concepts such as shrewd and imprudent, epistemic concepts such as
open-minded and gullible, and aesthetic concepts such as banal and
gracious. These concepts stand in an intuitive contrast to those we
typically express when we use thin terms such as <em>right</em>,
<em>bad</em>, <em>permissible</em>, and <em>ought</em>. (Concepts are
often regarded as non-linguistic representational items that can serve
as the meanings of linguistic expressions and as constituents of
propositions; terms are linguistic items that can be used to express
concepts. The precise relation between concepts and language may be
complicated, however. In what follows, small capitals denote concepts
and italics denote terms.) Typically when someone calls an action bad,
they evaluate it negatively without committing themselves to much if
anything by way of non-evaluative description. This descriptive
thinness of bad makes it more general than selfish or cruel. Even if
calling something selfish evaluates it as bad in some way or respect,
not just any bad act can count as selfish; it must also involve the
agent giving a certain degree of priority to herself over others. So
the application of thick terms and concepts seems somehow to involve
both evaluation and non-evaluative description.</p>

<p>
It is primarily this combination of evaluation and non-evaluative
description that has attracted philosophical attention to thick
concepts in ethics since the mid-twentieth century. Thick concepts
have been thought to provide leverage in various debates concerning
the nature of evaluative thought and talk and to illuminate such
questions as whether there is a robust fact-value distinction, whether
ethical claims enjoy a significant kind of objectivity, and how
evaluative classifications relate to non-evaluative classifications.
Doing justice to the full diversity and complexity of moral thinking
has also been thought to require more attention to thick concepts. A
primary focus on thin concepts over the thick in much of the history
of Western moral philosophy at least since Kant threatens to simplify
and mislead also in normative ethics, where the revival of virtue
ethics as a major alternative to deontology and consequentialism
coincides with increased attention to thick terms and concepts in
metaethics. Interest in thick concepts has also extended from ethics
to other areas of philosophy such as aesthetics, epistemology, and
philosophy of science. Several questions run through all these
motivations for focusing on thick concepts. We have a
&ldquo;combination question&rdquo;: how exactly do thick terms and
concepts combine evaluation and non-evaluative description? We have a
&ldquo;location question&rdquo;: is evaluation somehow inherent to
thick concepts and an aspect of the conventional meaning of thick
terms, or merely a characteristic feature of how thick terms are used
or function in social contexts? We have a &ldquo;delineation
question&rdquo;: how do thick terms differ from the thin and from
other kinds of evaluative terms? Given answers to these questions,
what broader significance within ethics and applications outside of
ethics might thick ethical concepts have? What follows is a survey of
various attempts to answer these questions.</p>

<h2 id="WhatThicConcBackPrel">1. What Are Thick Concepts? Background and Preliminaries</h2>

<p>
The designation &ldquo;thick concept&rdquo; for concepts that combine
evaluation and non-evaluative description originates in Bernard
Williams&rsquo;s <em>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</em>
(Williams 1985). Williams seems to have drawn the label
&ldquo;thick&rdquo; from the notion of &ldquo;thick description&rdquo;
introduced by Gilbert Ryle and adapted to other purposes by the
anthropologist Clifford Geertz. Ryle characterizes thick descriptions
as descriptions of human activities not as mere bodily motions but as
involving intentional and purposive detail that helps us understand
those activities (Ryle 1968). In Geertz&rsquo;s terminology thickness
is a matter of the culturally specific significance of such details
(Geertz 1973). Unlike thick concepts, thick descriptions in
Ryle&rsquo;s and Geertz&rsquo;s senses needn&rsquo;t involve
evaluation. The connection to Williams&rsquo;s terminology is that
many thick concepts incorporate culturally specific information (cf.
Scanlon 2003). Different societies might have sufficiently different
understandings of courage to have distinct concepts of it, and some
might lack a concept altogether. There is similar cultural specificity
to the kind of sexual morality in which chaste plays a role and the
kind of honor culture in which noble has a point (cf. Williams 1985:
141ff.). While the terminology of &ldquo;thick&rdquo; and
&ldquo;thin&rdquo; concepts originates in Williams, he wasn&rsquo;t
the first to spot the distinction he uses these labels to pick out.
For instance, when R. M. Hare distinguishes &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;
and &ldquo;secondarily&rdquo; evaluative words in <em>The Language of
Morals</em>, his examples of the former are paradigmatic thin concepts
and some of his examples of the latter are paradigmatic thick
concepts. (Hare 1952: 121&ndash;2; see also the discussion of
persuasive definitions in Stevenson 1938.)</p>

<p>
Standard examples of thick and thin terms and concepts exhibit an
intuitive contrast: terms like <em>generous</em>, <em>cruel</em>, and
<em>tactful</em> appear to have more descriptive content than terms
such as <em>wrong</em> or <em>good</em>, which seem more purely
evaluative or normative. Even if calling something
&lsquo;selfish&rsquo; evaluates it as bad in some way, not just any
bad act can count as selfish. Selfish acts also involve the agent
giving some significant degree of priority to herself over others. How
this intuitive contrast is best understood is subject to several
controversies and may have no theory-neutral answer.</p>

<p>
First, in saying that thick terms and concepts are in some sense both
evaluative and descriptive, what is meant by these notions?
Illustrative examples of descriptive terms include <em>square</em>,
<em>gold</em>, <em>wombat</em>, <em>bumpy</em>, <em>recursive</em>,
<em>beer</em>, <em>unequal in income</em>, and (plausibly)
<em>painful</em>. Paradigmatic examples of evaluative terms include
thin terms such as <em>good</em>, <em>bad</em>, <em>ought</em>,
<em>right</em>, and <em>wrong</em>. We cannot distinguish the
evaluative and the descriptive simply in terms of different functions
in our thought and talk. For if judgments involving thick concepts are
evaluative judgments, then cognitivists and non-cognitivists disagree
about their function. According to non-cognitivists, the primary
function of evaluative vocabulary is to express and induce conative
attitudes, such as desire, preference, or (dis)approval, which
aren&rsquo;t truth-apt. (A desire for world peace is no more the sort
of thing that can be true or false than a command like &lsquo;Shut
up!&rsquo;) But according to cognitivists, evaluative terms are like
descriptive terms in that their primary function is to express
cognitive states such as beliefs, which are apt to be assessed as
(robustly) true or false. Nor can we capture the distinction between
thick and thin terms by identifying the descriptive with the factual:
to assume that evaluations cannot be factual would be to assume the
kind of distinction between &ldquo;facts&rdquo; and
&ldquo;values&rdquo; which thick concepts are sometimes thought to
undermine (see
 <a href="#OughGapFactValuDist">section 2.1</a>).
 In neutral terms we may not be able to do much better than to say
that the purely descriptive terms are given by a big list of terms
that would generally be classified as falling on the <em>is-</em>side
of the distinction between <em>is</em> and <em>ought</em> and all the
rest are evaluative terms (Jackson 1998: 120). Descriptive terms would
thus be purely non-evaluative. This boundary may not be sharp; in
particular, it might be vague whether thick terms such as
<em>honest</em> should be classified as purely descriptive or partly
evaluative (Jackson 1998: 120). And even if not vague, it is a matter
of controversy, as we&rsquo;ll see in
 <a href="#LocaQuesHowThicConcEval">section 4</a>.
 In any case, if we take the evaluative to exclude only the
<em>purely</em> non-evaluative, then non-evaluative description will
be something given in purely non-evaluative terms. The interesting
feature of thick terms and concepts is that even if they count as
evaluative on a binary distinction, they are supposed to straddle the
distinction.</p>

<p>
Second, it is remarkably difficult to find a suitably neutral positive
characterization of what thick concepts are, beyond the idea that they
somehow combine evaluation and non-evaluative description. Williams
characterizes the application of thick concepts as both
&ldquo;action-guiding&rdquo; and &ldquo;guided by the world&rdquo;:
their application depends on the way the world is, but also &ldquo;if
a concept of this kind applies, this often provides someone with a
reason for action&rdquo; (Williams 1985: 140; see also Moore 2006;
Heuer 2012; Smith 2013: 102&ndash;5). By contrast, the application of
thin evaluative concepts is supposed to be purely action-guiding and
not world-guided. But moral realists presumably think that the
application of thin concepts is also world-guided: whether a thin
concept truly applies depends on how the world of objective values
lies. Other existing characterizations either suffer from similar
problems in failing to characterize thick concepts, or else are either
not very informative or too theory-laden (see, e.g., Gibbard 1992,
Dancy 1995, Scanlon 2003, Kyle 2020, and for critical discussion
Eklund 2011).</p>

<p>
Third, the intuitive contrast between thick and thin terms as terms
that somehow combine evaluation and non-evaluative description
classifies as thick not only paradigmatic thick concepts in the style
of cruel, courageous, and kind, but also
&ldquo;respect-relative&rdquo; evaluative concepts, pejorative terms,
and more. Claims like &lsquo;This is a good knife&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Charlie is good with children&rsquo; ascribe ways of being good
in certain non-evaluatively specified respects. Similarly, speaking of
people as &ldquo;krauts&rdquo; or &ldquo;wingnuts&rdquo; involves
evaluating them negatively on the basis of, respectively, their
nationality and political affiliation, and calling someone a jerk
involves evaluating him (it usually is a he) negatively for having
certain sorts of non-evaluative features that make a person
unlikeable. But it is controversial whether paradigmatic thick
concepts work in the same way as concepts for specific ways of being
good and pejoratives. It is also unclear whether
&ldquo;affective&rdquo; terms such as <em>admirable</em> and
<em>contemptible</em> are substantially similar to paradigmatic thick
terms and concepts. Finally, some philosophers investigate &ldquo;dual
character concepts&rdquo; (for an overview and references, see Reuter
2019). These are supposed to be similar to thick concepts in involving
both description and evaluation, but distinctive in that their
descriptive and evaluative dimensions, while related, are independent.
For instance, there is a sense in which a person may count as an
artist if certain descriptive conditions, such as making sculptures
for a living, are met. But there is also a sense in which a person may
count as an artist if she satisfies norms concerning what an artist
<em>should</em> be or do. A person may count as an artist in one sense
but not the other. This might be regarded as evidence that
<em>artist</em> encodes two independent dimensions of content, which
are weighted differently in different contexts of use. One alternative
analysis is that words like <em>artist</em> are polysemous. In that
case they would stand for different concepts in different occurrences,
rather than one concept with multiple dimensions of content. The
relationship between dual character and thick concepts may thus depend
on what notion of concepts we work with. This issue has rarely been
addressed in detail in the literature on thick concepts. Either way,
questions arise concerning whether dual character concepts and thick
concepts are normative or evaluative in the same kind of way and
whether some concepts might be both thick and dual character. Some
suggest that empirical investigation can shed light on the nature of
dual character concepts and their relation to thick concepts (Reuter
2019; Liao <em>et al</em>. 2020).</p>

<p>
Despite these complications in characterizing thick terms and
concepts, they are widely agreed to be of potentially high
significance. An important assumption in many metaethical debates is
that the evaluative and the non-evaluative can be sharply
distinguished. If the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of thick
terms or concepts aren&rsquo;t separable into distinct components,
these debates may be impacted in a fundamental way. Starting with some
prominent arguments in the literature concerning the significance of
thick concepts will naturally lead us to fundamental questions about
their nature.</p>

<h2 id="DoThicConcHaveDistSign">2. Do Thick Concepts Have Distinctive Significance?</h2>

<p>
It is one thing to say that thick concepts are a distinctive kind of
evaluative concepts, another to say that this gives them distinctive
philosophical significance not carried by thin concepts. Among various
arguments which attribute distinctive significance to thick terms and
concepts, two have been particularly influential: arguments concerning
the &ldquo;<em>is-ought</em> gap&rdquo; and the distinction between
facts and values, and the &ldquo;anti-disentangling&rdquo; argument.
We&rsquo;ll also briefly address questions bearing on the relative
priority of thick and thin concepts in evaluative thought.</p>

<h3 id="OughGapFactValuDist">2.1 The <em>Is-Ought</em> Gap and the Fact-Value Distinction</h3>

<p>
It is common to think that the intuitive contrast between <em>is</em>
and <em>ought</em> marks an important gap between distinct domains,
and sometimes this gap is identified as a distinction between
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; and &ldquo;values&rdquo;. Thick concepts may be
thought to challenge such dichotomies between facts and values
(Murdoch 1970; Williams 1985: 140&ndash;5; Dancy 1995; Putnam 2002:
34&ndash;45). To avoid misunderstanding, note that an important gap
can be held to exist even if values are a special kind of facts. For
instance, according to so-called Hume&rsquo;s Law, one cannot derive
an <em>ought</em> from an <em>is</em> (Hume 1739&ndash;40:
&sect;3.1.1). Any (non-trivial) valid argument for an evaluative
conclusion must somehow (perhaps implicitly) involve evaluative
content in its premises. This logical or conceptual barrier can be
generalized to concern various relations of reasonable inference
between the non-evaluative and the evaluative. The underlying thought
is that evaluative and normative statements commend things and guide
action, whereas purely non-evaluative statements play no such
practical role by themselves (for vast issues that lurk in the
background here, see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/normativity-metaethics/">Normativity in Metaethics</a>).
 The resulting claim that there is no reasonable (non-trivial)
inference to any evaluative conclusion from any set of purely
non-evaluative premises is sometimes called &ldquo;the autonomy of
ethics&rdquo; (Rynin 1957; Prior 1960).</p>

<p>
Even if evaluative conclusions that deploy thin terms such as
<em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> cannot be derived from purely
non-evaluative premises, a conceptual gap between evaluative and
non-evaluative statements requires the same to be true also of
evaluative conclusions that deploy thick terms. Philippa Foot argues
that thick terms such as <em>rude</em> undermine the <em>is-ought</em>
gap: calling something rude is evaluative because it expresses
condemnation in the same kind of way as <em>bad</em> and
<em>wrong</em> do, but this evaluation can be derived from a
non-evaluative description (Foot 1958; for discussion, see especially
Eklund 2011: 29&ndash;32). Consider the following inference:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>O</em>: <em>x</em> causes offense by indicating lack of respect
<br />
So,
<br />
<em>R</em>: <em>x</em> is rude
</blockquote>

<p>
Foot claims that it would be inconsistent to accept <em>O</em> but
deny <em>R</em> (Foot 1958: 507&ndash;9). But then it would seem that
a thick evaluative claim, namely that <em>x</em> is rude, is
analytically entailed by a purely non-evaluative claim: it is in
virtue of what the word <em>rude</em> means that anything that causes
offense by indicating lack of respect is rude. The entailment is
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo; if it holds solely by virtue of the meanings of
the words in question (see the entry
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/">The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction</a>).
 Foot targets her argument at non-cognitivists such as R.M. Hare, but
the issue arises wherever a statement deploying a thick term is
counted as evaluative in meaning.</p>

<p>
A common reply is that Foot&rsquo;s argument yields problematic
consequences when applied to thick terms that one regards as
objectionable, as embodying values that should be rejected (Eklund
2011). Many people regard the thick terms <em>chaste</em> and
<em>lewd</em> as objectionable because they reject the kind of sexual
morality that these terms are normally used to convey. Atheists are
likely to regard <em>blasphemous</em> and <em>sinful</em> as
objectionable on similar grounds, and a <em>laissez-faire</em>
capitalist who thinks that there is nothing bad about selfishness may
well regard <em>selfish</em> as objectionable in its normal negative
use. Whether one regards a concept as objectionable depends on whether
the values the concept is associated with are ruled out by one&rsquo;s
own values; a concept is in fact objectionable if the values it
embodies ought in fact to be rejected. Consider now inferences that
are identical in form to Foot&rsquo;s but deploy objectionable thick
terms:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>O</em>*: <em>x</em> is an overt sexual display
<br />
So,
<br />
<em>L</em>: <em>x</em> is lewd
</blockquote>

<p>
If <em>O</em> analytically entails <em>R</em> and <em>R</em> commits
us to a condemnation of its object, then <em>O</em> already commits us
to this negative attitude. <em>O</em>* should then likewise commit us
to a negative attitude towards its object. But there is no
inconsistency in accepting that some actions are overt sexual displays
and yet refusing to condemn anything merely for being an overt sexual
display. The point is clearer still if thick claims entail thinner
claims to the effect that something is good or bad in a certain
way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>x</em> causes offense by indicating lack of respect.
<br />
So, <em>x</em> is rude.
<br />
So, <em>x</em> is bad in a certain way.</p>

<p>
<em>x</em> is an overt sexual display.
<br />
So, <em>x</em> is lewd.
<br />
So, <em>x</em> is bad in a certain way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If these entailments hold, then, by the transitivity of entailment,
the non-evaluative claim &lsquo;<em>x</em> is an overt sexual
display&rsquo; commits anyone who accepts it to the claim that
<em>x</em> is bad in a certain way. But there is no inconsistency in
accepting the former and rejecting the latter. What one seems to be at
most required to accept is that <em>x</em> is lewd in some
non-evaluative sense. The English language might have no other word
for expressing that evaluatively neutral sense, but there are various
ways to indicate that one means <em>lewd</em> in that way, such as
using scare quotes or a certain tone of voice. Exactly the same should
then go for <em>rude</em>. So Foot is mistaken about what
&lsquo;<em>x</em> is rude&rsquo; entails. (This reply is modeled on R.
M. Hare&rsquo;s reply that Foot&rsquo;s argument delivers the wrong
results for formally identical inferences that involve racial or
ethnic slurs; see Hare 1963: 188&ndash;9, and also Eklund 2011.
Substituting slurs with objectionable thick terms allows us to bracket
the issue whether slurs and thick terms are evaluative in the same
way. Hare&rsquo;s basic reply to Foot needn&rsquo;t suppose that they
are. For discussion, see
 <a href="supplement.html#ThicTermPejo">section 4</a>
 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">&ldquo;Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance&rdquo;</a>
 and, for slurs, the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/">Hate Speech</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
It is unclear whether this reply shows that the <em>is-ought</em>
inferences Foot asks us to consider are invalid. The fact that someone
who regards <em>lewd</em> as objectionable refuses to condemn overt
sexual displays doesn&rsquo;t show that it is impossible for
<em>O</em>* to be true while <em>L</em> is false. Perhaps someone who
accepts <em>O</em>* but refuses to assert <em>L</em> (unless it is
clear that she is using <em>lewd</em> in an evaluatively neutral
sense) is like someone who refuses to say about prunes what she has
already accepted about dried plums (Foot 1958: 509). Refusing to call
a dried plum a prune makes it no less true that it is a prune. Perhaps
the same is true of thick terms and the non-evaluative descriptions
that Foot claims can be used in their stead. Either way, these
complications prompt the question of how tightly thick and thin terms
are connected.</p>

<p>
Whether thick terms help undermine the <em>is-ought</em> gap depends
on the way in which thick terms are evaluative. If at least some thick
terms were such that the sentences in which they figure are entailed
by non-evaluative sentences and also semantically express or entail
evaluation, then thick terms would constitute counterexamples to the
<em>is-ought</em> gap. It couldn&rsquo;t be that &lsquo;<em>x</em>
causes offense by indicating lack of respect&rsquo; is true but
&lsquo;<em>x</em> is bad in a certain way&rsquo; is false. If thick
terms had evaluatively neutral truth-conditional equivalents, they
might instead be treated as conventionally triggering evaluation
without semantically expressing or entailing evaluation (Cepollaro and
Stojanovic 2016, Zakkou 2023). If &lsquo;<em>x</em> is rude&rsquo;
semantically expressed something like &lsquo;<em>x</em> causes offense
by indicating lack of respect&rsquo; but uttering it also committed
you to &lsquo;<em>x</em> is bad in a certain way&rsquo; in some
non-cancellable way, this would undermine at most a linguistic
<em>is-ought</em> gap at the level of thick terms and sentences, but
not necessarily a conceptual <em>is-ought</em> gap at the level of
thick concepts and propositions. Another possible view is that thick
terms have no conventional evaluative meaning (semantically expressed
or otherwise), but are characteristically or commonly used
evaluatively. Then thick terms couldn&rsquo;t be invoked to undermine
even a linguistic <em>is-ought</em> gap. (Here note a terminological
matter. Some who think that evaluation is only pragmatically
associated with terms like <em>courageous</em> or <em>rude</em> take
this to mean that there are no thick concepts, but only loaded words;
see Blackburn 1992 and, on the general phenomenon, Stevenson 1938.
This is what we should say if a thick concept must be both evaluative
and descriptive as a matter of meaning. Others who accept a pragmatic
view are happy to talk about terms or concepts such as
<em>courageous</em> or <em>rude</em> as thick, using
&ldquo;thick&rdquo; to refer to terms and concepts that
characteristically involve both evaluation and non-evaluative
description in some way or other; see V&auml;yrynen 2013. This entry
adopts the latter usage.) This &ldquo;location question&rdquo;
concerning how thick terms are related to the evaluations they
normally convey is the topic of
 <a href="#LocaQuesHowThicConcEval">section 4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The <em>is-ought</em> gap discussed above is a gap between different
kinds of representations, whether linguistic or conceptual. This kind
of gap is what philosophers sometimes have in mind when they
distinguish &ldquo;facts&rdquo; and &ldquo;values&rdquo;. But
sometimes they mean an ontological gap between facts and values or
evaluative and non-evaluative facts and properties. Even if there is a
linguistic or conceptual gap among our evaluative and non-evaluative
representations, it doesn&rsquo;t directly follow that there are no
thick evaluative properties that aren&rsquo;t separable into distinct
evaluative and non-evaluative components (Eklund 2017). Such
properties would violate a sharp ontological distinction between
values and non-evaluative facts. But that debate concerns moral
metaphysics rather than thick concepts.</p>

<h3 id="AntiDiseArgu">2.2 The &ldquo;Anti-Disentangling&rdquo; Argument</h3>

<p>
Thick terms challenge the <em>is-ought</em> gap only if at least one
thick term <em>T</em>is evaluative in meaning and has non-evaluative
application conditions that are analytically <em>sufficient</em> for
<em>T </em>to apply (i.e. sufficient solely in virtue of what
<em>T</em> means). What is more widely assumed is that thick terms and
concepts have some analytically <em>necessary</em> non-evaluative
application conditions. There is a robust intuition that a bad act can
be selfish only if it involves giving greater priority to oneself over
others in some way and rude only if it such as to cause offense, and
that a good act can be generous only if it involves giving to others
out of one&rsquo;s own resources and courageous only if it involves
some risk to the agent. Such intuitions may merit scrutiny. For
instance, there are good questions about how such partial necessary
conditions relate to whatever full content thick terms and concepts
semantically express. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible to state what
thick terms and concepts semantically express in anything like
Foot&rsquo;s sort of independently intelligible context-invariant
non-evaluative terms. Still, these intuitions seem robust enough that
you have some explaining to do if you say that thick terms and
concepts semantically entail or express <em>no</em> non-evaluative
information. One thing that merits attention is that many thick terms
seem context-sensitive. For example, just how offensive a remark has
to be to count as &lsquo;rude&rsquo; might vary with context and what
it takes to count as &lsquo;generous&rsquo; might be different
depending on which of financial generosity, emotional generosity, and
generosity with one&rsquo;s time are relevant. If that were so, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if even approximate paraphrases of thick
terms in independently intelligible context-invariant non-evaluative
terms were rarely available (V&auml;yrynen 2013: 165&ndash;7,
198&ndash;202). </p>

<p>
An argument offered by John McDowell is often interpreted as showing
that there can be no non-evaluative description that is both necessary
and sufficient for the application of a thick term and, moreover, that
this bears on whether the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of
thick terms and concepts are separable into distinct components
(Williams 1985: 140&ndash;1; Dancy 1995; Kirchin 2010).</p>

<p>
McDowell is concerned with</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
whether, corresponding to any value concept, one can always isolate
&hellip; a feature that is there &hellip; independently of
anyone&rsquo;s value experience being as it is. (McDowell 1981 [1998]:
200&ndash;1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He targets non-cognitivism in particular as a view that requires the
possibility of isolating a non-evaluative feature of this kind.
McDowell&rsquo;s argument against this possibility is often called the
&ldquo;disentangling argument&rdquo; (1981 [1998]: 202; cf. 216). We
may gloss it as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(D1)</dt>
<dd>If an evaluative concept <em>E</em> can be
&ldquo;disentangled&rdquo; into a non-evaluative description
<em>D</em> that is co-extensive with <em>E</em> and an evaluation that
gives the evaluative orientation of <em>E</em>, then it would be
possible to master the extension of <em>E</em>, and thus group
together exactly the items to which competent users would apply
<em>E</em>, without understanding its evaluative orientation.</dd>
<dt>(D2)</dt>
<dd>It isn&rsquo;t possible to anticipate the usage of <em>E</em> in a
way required for mastering its extension without understanding the
evaluative orientation of <em>E</em>.</dd>
<dt>(C)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, <em>E</em> cannot be disentangled into non-evaluative
description <em>D</em> that is co-extensive with <em>E</em> plus an
evaluation that gives the evaluative orientation of <em>E</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Given the conclusion, the label &ldquo;anti-disentangling
argument&rdquo; would seem more accurate (Roberts 2011). In support of
(D2), McDowell asks us to imagine &ldquo;a specific conception of some
moral virtue &hellip; current in a reasonably cohesive moral
community&rdquo; and then consider an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; to the
evaluative perspective of those who deploy the concept (McDowell 1981
[1998]: 201). An example might be someone who cannot even
imaginatively engage with the kind of sexual morality that is normally
conveyed by applying <em>lewd</em> to overt sexual display. Many
people find it implausible that such an outsider could master the
extension of <em>lewd</em> by grasping a non-evaluative content that
applies to all and only the items the insiders call <em>lewd</em>
(assuming there is one), and that this is so in principle, not merely
because of the contingent limitations of our language. (By
&lsquo;mastering the extension of a word&rsquo; McDowell seems to mean
something like being capable of applying the word correctly even in
novel cases and recognizing errors in one&rsquo;s use of the word.)
Unless there is a way to grasp the extension without engaging with
insiders&rsquo; evaluative perspective, it would seem that evaluative
classifications are in principle not graspable with purely
non-evaluative representational resources (McDowell 1981 [1998]:
216).</p>

<p>
The key question for present purposes is how the anti-disentangling
argument bears on thick terms and concepts. (On the argument itself,
see Lang 2001; Miller 2003: 250&ndash;4; and Roberts 2011, 2013a.) The
question isn&rsquo;t straightforward. McDowell makes a general claim
about evaluative terms. But many writers take it to bear on how thick
terms and concepts combine evaluation and non-evaluative description,
specifically by favoring Inseparability over Separability (Williams
1985; Kirchin 2010):</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Separability:</em> The evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of
thick terms and concepts are distinct components that can at least in
principle be &ldquo;disentangled&rdquo; from one another. (Hare 1952:
121&ndash;2; Hare 1981: 17&ndash;8, 73&ndash;5; Blackburn 1992, 1998:
101ff.; Burton 1992; Miller 2003: 244&ndash;54; Richard 2008:
28&ndash;33; Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith 2013; Kyle 2020)</p>

<p>
<em>Inseparability:</em> Thick terms and concepts are or represent
irreducible fusions of evaluation and non-evaluative description which
cannot be &ldquo;disentangled&rdquo;. (Williams 1985: 129&ndash;30,
140&ndash;1; Putnam 2002: ch. 2; Kirchin 2010, 2017: ch. 2; Roberts
2011; Harcourt and Thomas 2013)</p>
</div>

<p>
Saying that the anti-disentangling argument favors Inseparability over
Separability misstates the case, however. The argument gets a grip on
thick terms only under the following assumption:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Descriptive Equivalence:</em> For every thick term or concept,
someone has or could acquire an independently intelligible purely
non-evaluative description with the same extension.</p>
</div>

<p>
According to Descriptive Equivalence, the extensions of thick terms
are determined only by their non-evaluative content; evaluative
content makes no difference to what things fall under a thick term. If
this means that an outsider who doesn&rsquo;t share the evaluative
outlook associated with a thick concept should nonetheless be able to
anticipate the insiders&rsquo; use, then the anti-disentangling
argument rules out Descriptive Equivalence. But that favors
Inseparability only if Separability entails Descriptive Equivalence;
as we&rsquo;ll see in
 <a href="#CombQuesHowDoThicConcInvoEvalDesc">section 3</a>,
 that assumption is highly controversial. (For problems with
Descriptive Equivalence itself, see Sreenivasan 2001.)</p>

<p>
Significant issues are at stake here. If Separability entails
Descriptive Equivalence but Descriptive Equivalence is false, then
thick terms and concepts cannot be analyzed or reduced to thin
evaluation plus non-evaluative description. For instance,
<em>rude</em> couldn&rsquo;t mean <em>bad for causing offense by
indicating lack of respect</em>. In that case, thin terms
wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy conceptual or explanatory priority over the
thick, and moral theorists would risk ignoring or distorting a
substantial range of moral phenomena if they focused exclusively on
the thin. But if Separability doesn&rsquo;t entail Descriptive
Equivalence, thick concepts may be explicable in terms of thin
evaluation plus non-evaluative description even if the
anti-disentangling argument is sound.</p>

<p>
The debate discussed above has largely supposed that a descriptive
equivalent would be encoded in the meaning of a thick term, and thus
would presumably be something that competent speakers should in
principle be able to articulate. But we would struggle to say what the
very many ways of being cruel, for instance, have in common without
relying on our understanding of <em>cruel</em> (Little 2000: 279). Our
poor track record in capturing the extensions of thick terms in
independently intelligible non-evaluative terms should then count
against Descriptive Equivalence. But note that, so far as the
anti-disentangling argument goes, a non-evaluative description could
be necessarily extensionally equivalent to an evaluative term or
concept without belonging to the latter&rsquo;s meaning. An evaluative
concept could be held to have a non-evaluative &ldquo;shape&rdquo; as
a matter of a necessary <em>a posteriori</em> equivalence, perhaps in
the way that the necessary equivalence of &ldquo;<em>x</em> is
water&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>x</em> is H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; is
discoverable only <em>a posteriori</em>. (D1) clearly allows this
possibility. (D2) must then remain plausible if &lsquo;possible&rsquo;
is read as including the possibility of mastering the extension of an
evaluative term by latching onto a non-evaluative necessary
extensional equivalent (provided there is one) in an <em>a
posteriori</em> way. The notion of disentangling in McDowell&rsquo;s
argument is therefore not semantic or conceptual. The argument&rsquo;s
real conclusion seems rather to be:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Shapelessness:</em> The extensions of evaluative terms and
concepts aren&rsquo;t unified under independently intelligible
non-evaluative relations of real similarity, not even as a matter of
synthetic <em>a posteriori</em> truth that isn&rsquo;t settled by the
meanings of evaluative terms or concepts. (Miller 2003: 250&ndash;4;
Kirchin 2010; Roberts 2011, 2013a; V&auml;yrynen 2014)</p>
</div>

<p>
If Shapelessness were true, that would explain why the sort of
disentanglement targeted by McDowell&rsquo;s argument isn&rsquo;t
possible. Indeed, the non-evaluative shapelessness of the evaluative
is often thought to provide a particularly good explanation of why
(D2) is plausible (Roberts 2011: 506).</p>

<p>
Although Shapelessness is a general issue about evaluative terms and
concepts, its bearing on thick concepts is worth noting. Suppose an
outsider could anticipate insiders&rsquo; use of an evaluative term in
new cases by using similarities between old cases and new cases to
infer whether the evaluative term applies in the new cases.
Shapelessness entails that such similarities would have to be
evaluative. If so, Descriptive Equivalence is false. Conversely,
insofar as the extensions of evaluative terms can be mastered on the
basis of non-evaluative similarities, Shapelessness is false. The way
thick terms involve non-evaluative description may be thought to make
them a particularly suitable test case for these general issues about
evaluative concepts. But note, finally, that thick concepts do so only
if they are <em>inherently</em> evaluative in some way that makes the
conventional meaning of thick terms evaluative. In
 <a href="#LocaQuesHowThicConcEval">section 4</a>
 we&rsquo;ll distinguish several versions of this generic thesis. Some
version of it clearly is presupposed by Inseparability. For
Separabilists, it is a further question whether the non-evaluative and
evaluative aspects of thick terms and concepts are both built into
their meaning. </p>

<h3 id="ReflKnowPrio">2.3 Reflection, Knowledge, and Priority</h3>

<p>
Thick concepts and their relation to the thin bear also on knowledge
in ethics. Bernard Williams famously claims that, unlike in science,
in ethics &ldquo;reflection can destroy knowledge&rdquo; (1985: 148;
see also Williams 1995). Thick terms and concepts are parochial, in
that they tend to have &ldquo;interest&rdquo; or a &ldquo;point&rdquo;
only in the context of some particular evaluative outlooks or
practices. The notion of lewdness as we know it really only has a life
within a particular kind of sexual morality. That is why those who
regard <em>lewd</em> as an objectionable term typically refrain from
using it. Industriousness seems to count as a positive quality only
against some such evaluative frame as the Protestant work ethic.
(Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point?) This would explain why, as (D2)
in the anti-disentangling argument claims, an unsympathetic outsider
might not be able to master the extensions that particular moral
communities assign to their thick terms. Now consider what Williams
calls a &ldquo;hypertraditional society&rdquo;: a maximally homogenous
and minimally reflective society whose ethical reflection only employs
thick concepts (Williams 1985: 142). Suppose <em>T</em> expresses one
of their thick concepts in their language. And suppose that claims of
the form <em><em>x</em> is <em>T</em></em> can express truths and
qualify as knowledge (see also Williams 1995). Williams suggests that
a judgment involving a thin concept such as good or bad &ldquo;is
essentially the product of reflection&rdquo; (Williams 1985: 146).
Since the hypertraditional society is unreflective, its members
don&rsquo;t deploy good or bad. In that case we cannot suppose that
<em>T</em> entails either. Now suppose a person from the
hypertraditional society has knowledge that <em>x</em> is <em>T</em>
but comes to reflect on her practices and acquires thin concepts. If
thick concepts reflect social worlds, reflection that stands back from
social practices must rely on thin concepts. Through reflection, the
person may come to reject her traditional way of life and the
evaluative perspective that goes with it, inferring from
<em><em>x</em> is <em>T</em></em> that <em>x</em> is bad. Or she may
come to endorse it, inferring that <em>x</em> is okay. Williams
suggests that &ldquo;when someone stands back from the practices of
the society and its use of these concepts and asks whether this is the
right way to go on&rdquo;, the sort of reflection that occurs
&ldquo;characteristically disturbs, unseats, or replaces &hellip;
traditional concepts&rdquo; (Williams 1985: 146, 148). But if the
person ceases to possess her traditional concept <em>T</em> through
evaluative reflection that deploys thin concepts, then presumably her
previous knowledge that <em>x</em> is <em>T</em> is destroyed.
Williams&rsquo;s thinking rests on controversial assumptions about
ethical knowledge which we cannot pursue here. It is also not entirely
clear what he thinks is involved in grasping a concept, sharing it
with other people, and losing one. These notions depend on large
issues in philosophy and cognitive science about the nature of
concepts and concept possession which we also cannot pursue here (see
the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/">Concepts</a>).
 Nor can we pursue fascinating issues concerning the implications of
being deprived of certain concepts (Fricker 2007: ch. 7). Let&rsquo;s
simply note that it isn&rsquo;t clear that losing traditional
convictions through reflection leads to a loss of concepts. You might
instead retain your concepts, and either find them a new evaluative
point (such as using what was a positive concept negatively) or shelve
those concepts as no longer suitable for structuring your experience
or expressing your worldview (Richard 2008: 33; V&auml;yrynen 2013:
123&ndash;5, 245). If you could retain a thick concept, but shorn of
its traditional evaluative trappings, its evaluative point
wouldn&rsquo;t be constitutive of it.</p>

<p>
An important general issue about thick concepts is in the mix here
either way. Consider the following widely accepted view about the
relation between thick and thin concepts:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Thin Centralism:</em> Thin terms and concepts are conceptually
and/or explanatorily prior to thick terms and concepts. (Hare 1952,
1963, 1981; Blackburn 1992, 1998, 2013; Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith
2013)</p>
</div>

<p>
If good and bad are conceptually prior to <em>T</em>, the members of a
hypertraditional society cannot grasp <em>T</em> without also grasping
them. But then they cannot lose <em>T</em> when they draw a reflective
inference from <em><em>x</em> is <em>T</em></em> to a thin evaluation.
Similarly the truth or falsity of <em><em>x</em> is <em>T</em></em>,
and the status of its acceptance as knowledge, will depend partly on
whether <em>x</em> is good or bad. But these thin evaluative facts may
be discernible to an outsider, thereby limiting the extent to which
thick concepts resist mastery by those who cannot imaginatively
inhabit the evaluative outlook within which it has a point. The same
consequences would seem to follow from:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>No Priority:</em> Thick and thin terms and concepts are
conceptually and explanatorily interdependent, with neither being
prior to the other. (Hurley 1989: 13; Dancy 1995; Tappolet 2004)</p>
</div>

<p>
Like Thin Centralism, No Priority entails that one cannot grasp thick
concepts without grasping thin concepts. Thus it seems that Williams
must reject Thin Centralism and No Priority, and must instead accept
one of the following views about the relationship between thick and
thin concepts:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Non-Centralism:</em> Thick and thin terms and concepts in general
exhibit no interesting relations of conceptual and/or explanatory
priority or interdependence. (V&auml;yrynen 2013: 250)</p>

<p>
<em>Thick Centralism:</em> Thick terms and concepts are conceptually
and/or explanatorily prior to thin terms and concepts. (Explicit
statements are rare, but see Chappell 2013 and Annas 2016.)</p>
</div>

<p>
Under Non-Centralism it might be difficult to explain why thin
evaluative reflection should tend to lead to a loss of traditional
thick concepts. Thick Centralism rules out Separability (see
 <a href="#CombQuesHowDoThicConcInvoEvalDesc">section 3</a>),
 but note in addition that Williams needs a version of Thick
Centralism on which the claim that grasping thin concepts requires
grasping specific thick concepts is compatible with the possibility of
subsequently losing those thick concepts through reflection that
deploys thin concepts. Regarding thick concepts in this way as a
throwaway ladder might not yield a stable form of Thick Centralism. An
important potential implication of Thick Centralism is that since not
everyone shares the same thick concepts, there might be no evaluative
language that is &ldquo;conceptually homogeneous&rdquo; across
cultures or across disagreements within a culture (cf. Williams 1995).
Williams further argues that we can draw significant conclusions about
the nature of not just ethical knowledge but also of evaluative truths
and their objectivity specifically from reflection on thick terms and
concepts, but these arguments are highly controversial (see Williams
1985: 135&ndash;6, 146&ndash;55; Quinn 1987; Scheffler 1987; Williams
1995; Lang 2001; Moore 2003; Kirchin 2017: 172&ndash;80).</p>

<p>
For a summary of some further questions about the significance of
thick concepts, see
 <a href="supplement.html#FurtQuesAbouSignThicConc">section 1</a>
 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">&ldquo;Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance&rdquo;</a>.</p>
 
<p>
All these arguments regarding the distinctive significance of thick
concepts point us to the same cluster of issues: the combination
question regarding how thick terms combine evaluation and
non-evaluative description, the location question regarding how the
evaluations they may be used to convey relate to their meaning or
content, and the delineation question regarding how thick terms and
concepts differ from the thin (and other evaluative terms).
Let&rsquo;s now turn to consider these debates in their own right.</p>

<h2 id="CombQuesHowDoThicConcInvoEvalDesc">3. The Combination Question: How Do Thick Concepts Relate Evaluation and Description?</h2>

<p>
The combination question concerns in what way the evaluation and
non-evaluative description involved in thick terms and concepts
relate. Calling something selfish normally conveys that it is bad, but
not just any bad action can qualify as selfish; selfish acts must
involve the agent giving greater priority to some of her own interests
over others&rsquo;. (Those interests may be different in different
circumstances: one can be emotionally selfish, financially selfish,
and so on.) Separabilists hold that thick concepts are a combination
of distinct non-evaluative concepts and other (usually thin)
evaluative concepts. Philosophers who accept Thin Centralism typically
accept Separability. And philosophers (often the same ones) who reject
Shapelessness or aim to avoid the anti-disentangling argument also
typically accept Separability. But as we&rsquo;ll see, Separability
commits you to neither Thin Centralism nor Shapelessness. While some
philosophers writer as if Separabilist views were essentially
non-cognitivist (Dancy 1995; Kirchin 2010), cognitivists can well
accept Separability (Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith 2013). Separabilist
views are sometimes called &ldquo;reductive&rdquo; (Kirchin 2010;
Roberts 2013a; Harcourt and Thomas 2013). A word of caution about this
label is that Separabilist views needn&rsquo;t be reductionist in the
sense of reducing evaluative properties to non-evaluative ones. By
contrast, Inseparabilists hold that the meanings of thick terms and
concepts are both evaluative and descriptive but cannot be divided
into distinct contents; talk of &ldquo;combining&rdquo; evaluation and
non-evaluative description is liable to mislead if it suggests putting
together distinct elements (Dancy 1995: 268). Thick concepts are a
distinct kind of fundamental evaluative concepts. Accordingly
Inseparabilist Views are often called &ldquo;non-reductive&rdquo;, or
views on which thick concepts are &ldquo;irreducibly thick&rdquo;.
Philosophers who accept Thick Centralism typically accept
Inseparability, and those who accept Inseparability typically accept
Shapelessness and express sympathy for the anti-disentangling
argument. (As we&rsquo;ll see, these views needn&rsquo;t cluster as
neatly as is sometimes assumed.)</p>

<h3 id="SepaView">3.1 Separabilist Views</h3>

<p>
According to Separability, the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects
of thick terms and concepts are distinct components that can at least
in principle be disentangled from one another. In this section
we&rsquo;ll discuss how Separabilists may specify the non-evaluative
descriptive content and its relation to the evaluative content. By way
of preliminaries, note that many Separabilists take the evaluative
content of thick terms to be located in their truth-conditions, but if
those evaluations are some other kind of features of thick terms or
their uses, they will be separable from the non-evaluative descriptive
contents of thick terms in whatever way such features are in general
separable from truth-conditional meaning (see
 <a href="#LocaQuesHowThicConcEval">section 4</a>).
 While Separabilists often take this evaluative content to be thin,
Separability as such doesn&rsquo;t require this. The evaluative
content of &ldquo;What you did was tactless&rdquo; might not be
&ldquo;What you did was <em>pro tanto</em> bad&rdquo; but more like
&ldquo;What did you did was bad in a certain way&rdquo;, where the
specification of the &ldquo;certain way&rdquo; will introduce
descriptive information, such as &ldquo;pertaining to manners&rdquo;.
Alternatively the evaluative contents of thick terms might be given by
affective concepts such as admirable or amusing (Tappolet 2004; for
criticism, see Harcourt and Thomas 2013). On neither view does
Separability entail Thin Centralism, although if <em>admirable</em>
means simply <em>worthy of admiration</em>, Thin Centralism can be
maintained. Note that when we see below some Separabilists proposing
an &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; of thick terms, they needn&rsquo;t be
understood as claiming that any actual language allows us to give a
satisfactory statement of a putative analysis of a thick term or
concept. Our inability to provide such a statement doesn&rsquo;t show
that the term or concept is unanalyzable or that Inseparability is
true.</p>

<p>
In what kind of relation does the evaluative content <em>E</em> of a
thick term <em>T </em>stand to its non-evaluative descriptive content
<em>D</em> if they are separable? In
 <a href="#OughGapFactValuDist">section 2.1</a>
 we saw a simple view about the connection: <em>D</em> entails
<em>E</em>. This threatens an <em>is-ought</em> gap which many want to
maintain. And if <em>D</em> is an independently intelligible
non-evaluative equivalent of <em>T</em>, this also commits you to
Descriptive Equivalence, and makes you vulnerable to the
anti-disentangling argument. If <em>D</em> doesn&rsquo;t entail
<em>E</em>, how might they be connected? It doesn&rsquo;t seem that
<em>T</em> is just conjunction of <em>D </em>and <em>E</em>. One
option for Separabilists is to analyze thick terms or concepts as
featuring an explanatory relation; if <em>E </em>holds because <em>D
</em>holds, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that <em>D</em> entails
<em>E</em>. In this vein, Stephan Burton suggests that thick terms can
be analyzed as meaning &ldquo;<em>x</em> is <em>E</em> in virtue of
some particular instance of <em>D</em>&rdquo; (Burton 1992; see also
Tappolet 2004). <em>Selfish</em>, for instance, would mean something
like &ldquo;bad in a certain way in virtue of some particular instance
of giving priority to oneself over others&rdquo;. This would allow
thick concepts to be sensitive to &ldquo;the various different
characteristics and contexts&rdquo; of <em>D</em>. You might not count
as selfish if you benefit yourself over benefiting two other people to
the same degree each as you benefit yourself but things may be
different if seven other people are in the mix, and what counts as the
relevant kind of prioritizing of oneself might vary depending on
whether the context concerns emotional or financial selfishness, and
so on. So <em>D</em> alone isn&rsquo;t sufficient for <em>E</em>, and
the further non-evaluative detail about particular instances of
<em>D</em> that is needed for <em>E</em> to hold isn&rsquo;t built
into the meaning of <em>selfish</em> (Burton 1992: 31). This avoids
the anti-disentangling argument. For although <em>E</em> is still
(contextually) separable from <em>D</em>, <em>D</em> won&rsquo;t be
coextensive with <em>selfish</em> and an outsider&rsquo;s grasp of the
extension of <em>D</em> won&rsquo;t be enough for her to master how
insiders apply <em>selfish</em>. Separabilists might also have other
ways of securing these benefits. Brent Kyle argues that Separabilists
have no reason to analyze thick concepts as involving an explanatory
relation, and offers an alternative (discussed below) that also claims
to avoid the anti-disentangling argument (Kyle 2020: 916&ndash;17,
923).</p>

<p>
Since Separabilists can deny Descriptive Equivalence, the
anti-disentangling argument cannot establish Inseparability. But what
is meant to constrain the selection of the non-evaluative
&ldquo;characteristics and contexts&rdquo; that may be needed to
determine whether a thick term applies? And can these be grasped
without drawing on our antecedent understanding of the thick term? If
not, those drawn to Thin Centralism won&rsquo;t be satisfied, and
Burton&rsquo;s proposal will also fall short as a non-circular
analysis. Here we&rsquo;ll consider two other Separabilist proposals
for solving these problems about how thick terms combine evaluative
and non-evaluative information.</p>

<p>
Daniel Elstein and Thomas Hurka offer two patterns of analysis for
thick terms as &ldquo;sketches intended to illustrate the general
resources the reductive view has&rdquo; in solving these problems
(Elstein and Hurka 2009: 531). Each allows Separabilists to accept
Thin Centralism while explaining why an outsider to the relevant
evaluative practice couldn&rsquo;t grasp the extension of a given
thick term. Each of Elstein and Hurka&rsquo;s patterns of analysis
locates evaluation in the meanings of thick terms. On the first, the
non-evaluative content of a thick term is only partially specified
within its meaning: its meaning specifies good-making (or bad-making)
non-evaluative properties of a general type, but may not specify what
exactly these good-making properties are. An example they give is that
&ldquo;<em>x</em> is distributively just&rdquo; means</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>x</em> is good, and there are properties <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>,
and <em>Z</em> (not specified) that distributions have as
distributions, or in virtue of their distributive shape, such that
<em>x</em> has <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, and <em>Z</em>, and <em>X</em>,
<em>Y</em>, and <em>Z</em> make any distribution that has them good.
(Elstein and Hurka 2009: 522)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This analysis separates non-evaluative description from evaluation,
and grasping it requires grasping good. But grasping the
non-evaluative information that <em>distributively just</em> only
applies to distributions won&rsquo;t be enough to know just which
distributions fall into its extension. That requires knowing which
properties of distributions are good making. Similarly, mastering how
insiders apply <em>distributively just</em> requires knowing which
properties they take to make distributions good. In this way,
Separabilists can agree that &ldquo;evaluation drives extension&rdquo;
(a phrase from Blackburn 1992; see also Gibbard 1992). Thus they can
accept the second premise of the anti-disentangling argument while
rejecting its first premise (which presupposes Descriptive
Equivalence).</p>

<p>
On Elstein and Hurka&rsquo;s first pattern of analysis, a thick term
involves only a &ldquo;global&rdquo; evaluation that &ldquo;governs
the whole concept&rdquo;: anything to which <em>distributively
just</em> applies is good, and we can identify the general
non-evaluative type to which it belongs independently of any
evaluation. Their second pattern of analysis, which is meant to fit
many virtue and vice concepts, supplements the global thin evaluation
with a further thin evaluation that is embedded within non-evaluative
description. An example they give is that &lsquo;act <em>x</em> is
courageous&rsquo; means something like</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>x</em> is good, and <em>x</em> involves an agent&rsquo;s accepting
harm or the risk of harm for himself for the sake of goods greater
than the evil of that harm, where this property makes any act that has
it good. (Elstein and Hurka 2009: 527)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reference to &ldquo;goods&rdquo; is an &ldquo;embedded&rdquo;
evaluation: you can&rsquo;t even specify the general type of those
actions which <em>courageous</em> evaluates globally as good without
knowing what count as good goals. But determining this will again
require evaluations which an outsider cannot access simply by knowing
the non-evaluative content of <em>courageous</em> (Elstein and Hurka
2009: 526&ndash;7). Note how global and embedded evaluations differ:
you can grasp the embedded evaluation of what count as good goals
without any view on what counts as courageous (or even without having
the concept), but not so with the global evaluation. (To have a view
of what property of the relevant type makes anything that has it good
<em>is</em> to have a view on what counts as courageous, on their
analysis.) Below &lsquo;evaluation&rsquo; means global evaluation
unless noted otherwise.</p>

<p>
Brent Kyle proposes a different way for Separabilists to avoid the
anti-disentangling argument. According to his positive account of the
meaning of thick concepts, the Expansion View, thick concepts are
expanded contents of thin terms. An expanded content is, roughly, the
semantic content of a predicate with modifiers: that Chuck is ready to
party and that Chuck is ready for work are among the expanded contents
that &lsquo;Chuck is ready&rsquo; can express in different contexts of
utterance, and likewise for &lsquo;Shaq is agile&rsquo; and the
proposition that Shaq is agile for a basketball player. Kyle proposes
that, similarly, admirable is an expanded content of worthy, namely
worthy-[of-admiration], that courageous can be analyzed as some such
expanded content of true as true-[to-a-good-cause-despite-risk], and
that kind can be analyzed as some such expanded content of good as
good-[to-someone-as-an-end] (Kyle 2020: 918&ndash;22). The Expansion
View contends that all thick concepts have correct analyses of the
sort which these rough approximations aim to illustrate. One question
about it is how to distinguish, say, <em>courageous</em> from at least
certain utterances of <em>reckless</em> in a non-circular way. Many
reckless acts satisfy at least the toy analysis of courageous as
true-[to-a-good-cause-despite-risk]. The Expansion View is a form of
Separability because it requires that thick concepts are composed in
part of thin ones (for details, see Kyle 2020: 924&ndash;25). But it
doesn&rsquo;t imply that any thick concept can be disentangled into a
thin evaluative content plus a non-evaluative description that is
co-extensive with the thick concept.</p>

<p>
Separability promises to make it clear how thick terms and concepts
are both evaluative and descriptive. They inherit their non-evaluative
meanings from whatever non-evaluative material makes them thick. The
evaluations they convey can be understood in terms of independently
intelligible evaluative concepts (perhaps thin concepts, or affective
concepts, or good-in-a-way concepts) that are applied to that
non-evaluative material. Kyle&rsquo;s Expansion View yields a form of
Separability that doesn&rsquo;t require Thin Centralism. But
conjoining Separability with Thin Centralism would also promise
theoretical economy: we could explicate a wide range of evaluative
concepts on the basis of just a few basic thin concepts and
non-evaluative concepts that we need to recognize anyway. The converse
won&rsquo;t follow from Inseparabilism even if Thick Centralism is
true, since thick terms are much more numerous than thin terms. Below
we&rsquo;ll discuss whether Inseparabilists can provide as clear an
explanation. </p>

<p>
Separability has also been claimed vital for normative criticism of
thick concepts. Simon Blackburn claims that those who apply
<em>cute</em> to adult women</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
react to an infantile, unthreatening appearance or self-presentation
in women &hellip; with admiration or desire (the men) or envy and
emulation (the women)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and that we couldn&rsquo;t criticize this attitude as objectionable if
the non-evaluative aspects of <em>cute</em> were inseparable from the
admirability or enviability which those non-evaluative aspects are
taken to ground (Blackburn 1998: 101). In response one might point out
that Inseparability allows that thick terms and concepts entail
non-evaluative descriptions of the sort of general type that figures
in Elstein and Hurka&rsquo;s analyses (&ldquo;has to do with
infantile, unthreatening appearance&rdquo;), so long as these
entailments don&rsquo;t exhaust their descriptive aspects. This in
turn opens up room for the specifically normative criticism that no
specific features of this general type make admiration or envy
appropriate when possessed by adult women. But Inseparabilists must be
able to square this idea with their account of how thick terms are
evaluative. So let&rsquo;s now turn to Inseparability.</p>

<h3 id="InseView">3.2 Inseparabilist Views</h3>

<p>
According to Inseparabilists, thick terms and concepts are irreducibly
thick: their meanings involve both evaluation and non-evaluative
description without this being a matter of combining constituent
evaluative and non-evaluative contents. For instance, <em>cruel</em>
expresses a <em>sui generis</em> evaluative concept that isn&rsquo;t a
combination of <em>pro tanto bad</em> or <em>bad in way
<em>W</em></em> with some non-evaluative content. How then is the idea
that thick terms are both descriptive and evaluative to be understood,
if not in terms of combining evaluative and descriptive components? It
cannot be that their meanings are both wholly evaluative and wholly
non-evaluative (which is how we are understanding the descriptive);
that would be contradictory.</p>

<p>
The challenge to Inseparabilists is to pin down more precisely how
thick terms are both evaluative and descriptive in ways that are
continuous with, respectively, thin evaluative concepts and
non-evaluative concepts. Simply stipulating new technical notions
would leave their claims about the distinctive philosophical
significance of thick concepts unsatisfactory. Not just any conceptual
entailment of a term seems constitutive of its meaning; while
&lsquo;<em>x</em> is a horse&rsquo; entails that <em>x</em> is a
mammal, it also entails that <em>x</em> isn&rsquo;t a wombat (or a
mountain, or a beer bottle), but not being a wombat (etc.) isn&rsquo;t
part of the meaning of <em>horse</em> (Dancy 2013: 49). But some
entailments are such that competence with the term requires grasping
them, and thick concepts seem to have some non-evaluative entailments
of this sort. As noted earlier, it is typically assumed to be a matter
of meaning that lewd acts involve overt sexual display, selfish acts
involve the agent giving priority to herself over others, and so on.
There is also a methodological rationale for focusing on entailments:
linguists study word meanings by considering patterns in competent
speakers&rsquo; entailment and contradiction judgments, synonymy
judgments, and judgments about truth-conditions because these reflect
relations among the entities that semantic theories assign to
linguistic expressions as their meanings (Chierchia and
McConnell-Ginet 2000: ch. 1). (A complication is that the meanings of
words may not map one-to-one onto the concepts those words may be used
to express. Writers on thick concepts often don&rsquo;t say what they
take concepts and their relation to word meanings to be. But again,
the nature of concepts and concept possession are large issues in
philosophy and cognitive science.)</p>

<p>
What should Inseparabilists say about the common way in which thick
and thin concepts are evaluative? Several views have been proposed,
but a simple proposal will hopefully suffice to give a feel for the
issue. Thick and thin concepts might be thought similar in that both
have intrinsic practical relevance (Dancy 2013: 56&ndash;7). Whereas
the relevance of a non-evaluative concept such as water to your
actions needs to be explained by citing other considerations, such as
your desire to quench thirst or the fact that you are stranded in the
desert, no further explanation is needed for the practical relevance
of thin concepts like ought or thick concepts such as courage. It is
&ldquo;to be expected&rdquo; that courageousness makes a practical
difference: it is normally, even if not always, something to aspire to
and admire. Whereas competence with non-evaluative concepts requires
only the ability to determine whether the concept applies, competence
with an evaluative concept requires also grasping its general
evaluative point&mdash;the sorts of practical difference its
instantiation can make in a particular case. For thick concepts, the
sort of difference may vary from case to case: rudeness is usually
inappropriate, but sometimes neutral and sometimes positively called
for. One problem with this view is that its metaethical commitments
are too controversial for a general distinction between evaluative and
non-evaluative concepts. For example, under the
&ldquo;internalist&rdquo; view of normative reasons, according to
which there is a reason for an agent to perform a particular action
only if the action is suitably related to the agent&rsquo;s
motivations, courageous and morally good have no more intrinsic
practical relevance than water and wombat (Williams 1981). Whether
their application makes a difference to your reasons will depend on
your motivations. It is also controversial that
&ldquo;objectionable&rdquo; thick concepts have intrinsic practical
relevance. Why then should other thick concepts?</p>

<p>
For a summary of other Inseparabilist views on how thick and thin
concepts are evaluative, see
 <a href="supplement.html#ThreFurtInseProp">section 2</a>
 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">&ldquo;Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance&rdquo;</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Debates about Separability and Inseparability frequently lead to two
further issues. The first is that Inseparability requires that thick
terms and concepts are inherently evaluative in meaning and that most
Separabilists also take evaluation and non-evaluative description to
be combined within the meanings of thick terms and concepts, not
merely their use. The second issue is that if thick terms and concepts
are inherently evaluative, it isn&rsquo;t enough to specify the shared
sense in which both thick and thin concepts are evaluative. To
preserve a distinction, we must also specify how they differ. (If
thick terms and concepts aren&rsquo;t inherently evaluative, we must
instead say how they differ from other non-evaluative descriptive
concepts.) The next two sections address these issues in turn.</p>

<h2 id="LocaQuesHowThicConcEval">4. The Location Question: How Are Thick Concepts Evaluative?</h2>

<p>
Everyone agrees that utterances involving thick terms (T-utterances,
for short) at least normally convey evaluation. Uttering &lsquo;Teo is
generous&rsquo; evaluates Teo positively. But how exactly do
T-utterances convey evaluation? The most widely accepted view, and a
crucial assumption of many arguments about Separability and the
putative broader significance of the thick, is that evaluation is a
primary content that is semantically expressed (Zakkou 2023: 441).
We&rsquo;ll consider this view in section 4.1. If the extension of a
thick term had a descriptive equivalent, then evaluation would make no
truth-conditional difference. A natural explanation of why an outsider
who grasps the non-evaluative content of a thick term couldn&rsquo;t
master the extension of a thick term would then be that it has also an
evaluative truth-condition that the outsider doesn&rsquo;t grasp.
Thick terms can challenge a logical or semantic <em>is-ought</em> gap
only if sentences involving them have an evaluative truth-condition,
since logical and semantic relations are relations between
truth-conditions. (These illustrations can be modified accordingly if
semantically expressed content isn&rsquo;t construed as
truth-conditional content.) Inseparabilists and many Separabilists
take evaluation to be the kind of aspect of conventional meaning that
contributes to semantically expressed content. The view that thick
terms semantically express evaluation is, however, controversial.
Utterances can convey various kinds of secondary content that
isn&rsquo;t semantically expressed. In
 <a href="#PragView">section 4.2</a>
 we&rsquo;ll distinguish several views about how T-utterances may
convey evaluation as a secondary content. We can assess these
different views by considering how well they explain various
linguistic data of the sorts on which linguists rely in assessing
claims about whether some feature of an utterance is semantically
expressed or not. The relevant data don&rsquo;t by themselves entail
any particular view. The views we&rsquo;ll consider should rather be
understood as claiming to constitute part of the best explanation of a
wide body of linguistic data involving thick terms.The data
we&rsquo;ll briefly consider below focus on what we called global
evaluations in
 <a href="#SepaView">section 3.1</a>.
 (Views on which the evaluations that are most closely associated with
T-utterances aren&rsquo;t semantically expressed can allow
conventional meanings of thick terms to contain embedded evaluation;
see V&auml;yrynen 2013: 42&ndash;3.) </p>

<h3 id="SemaView">4.1 The Semantic View</h3>

<p>
The most widely accepted view of the relation between thick terms and
evaluation is:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Semantic View:</em> Global evaluation is a primary content of
sentences involving thick terms that is semantically expressed.</p>
</div>

<p>
Some of the relevant linguistic data seem easy to explain if thick
terms are semantically evaluative. Consider the assertions in
(1)&ndash;(2):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="ex1">(1)</dt>
<dd># Making fun of an insecure person just for fun is cruel and not
bad in any way for it.</dd>
<dt id="ex2">(2)</dt>
<dd>Speaker <em>A</em>: It was courageous of Sue to stand up to that
racist on the bus.</dd>
<dd># Speaker <em>B</em>: Sure, courageous&mdash;and not good in any
way for it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In both
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 and the exchange in
 <a href="#ex2">(2)</a>,
 denying an evaluation that is normally conveyed by utterances
involving <em>cruel</em> and <em>courageous</em> is infelicitous
(indicated by &ldquo;#&rdquo;). If the first half of
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 semantically expresses global evaluation (of something as bad in a
certain way),
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 is infelicitous because its two halves contradict each other&mdash;a
very neat explanation! The same would go for the exchange in
 <a href="#ex2">(2)</a>:
 <em>A</em>&rsquo;s and <em>B</em>&rsquo;s utterances entail
contradictory claims about whether Sue&rsquo;s act was good in any
way. (See Kyle 2013a for a discussion of how the Semantic View might
allow that
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 isn&rsquo;t infelicitous in all contexts.) This explanation of the
Semantic View sounds cognitivist: it construes the evaluation as
presenting a certain class of things (not just an individual thing) as
good or bad in a certain way. But an expressivist about evaluative
language could construe it as expressing the speaker&rsquo;s positive
or negative attitude toward the things in question. </p>

<p>
It is natural to assume that if a certain evaluative content is
semantically expressed, then the evaluation it expresses is either
positive or negative but not both and the evaluation is the same in
all contexts where the term is used literally to make an assertion.
(We&rsquo;ll discuss non-assertive contexts below.) But many paradigm
thick terms can be used to evaluate negatively in some contexts and
positively in others. Some philosophers claim that the Semantic View
cannot explain this &ldquo;contextual variability&rdquo; in the
evaluative valence of T-utterances. Although <em>frugal</em> normally
conveys positive evaluation, calling someone whose &ldquo;main job is
dispensing hospitality&rdquo; frugal counts as a criticism (Blackburn
1992: 286). Similarly, although <em>cruel</em> normally conveys
negative evaluation, it might be thought to convey positive evaluation
when the cruelty of an action is &ldquo;just what made it such
fun&rdquo; (Hare 1981: 73). Such variability might be thought to show
that thick virtue concepts aren&rsquo;t evaluative concepts (Brower
1988). However, variability in valence is compatible with the Semantic
View (V&auml;yrynen 2011). These examples might be thought to involve
non-typical evaluation as a kind of speaker meaning rather than
semantic meaning. (What the speaker means in using some word can come
apart from conventional meaning. I can intend to be speaking about
plums of any kind when I use the word <em>prune</em> but that
doesn&rsquo;t make it any less the case that in English <em>prune</em>
means dried plums.) Or it might be that the normal evaluation is
semantically expressed and the opposite evaluation arises via one of
the pragmatic mechanisms we&rsquo;ll consider in
 <a href="#PragView">section 4.2</a>.
 Or it might be that although thick terms are semantically evaluative,
their valence isn&rsquo;t fixed but rather their meanings allow them
to involve different evaluations in different contexts (Dancy 1995).
These also don&rsquo;t exhaust the options for a semantic explanation
of variability (Kyle 2020: 926). More generally, it doesn&rsquo;t seem
promising to explain valence reversal by appeal to lexical
deflationism, ambiguity, or echoic use of language (Cepollaro
2018).</p>

<p>
A stronger challenge to the Semantic View is based on two more complex
sort of linguistic data: (i) <em>projection data</em> to the effect
evaluations normally conveyed by utterances of atomic sentences
containing thick terms seem to survive embedding in sentential
contexts that block semantically expressed content and (ii)
<em>defeasibility data</em> to the effect that those evaluations seem
to be defeasible in ways that semantically expressed content
isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>
Projection data are clearest in the case of objectionable thick
concepts which were introduced in
 <a href="#OughGapFactValuDist">section 2.1</a>.
 (The most comprehensive presentation of these data can be found in
V&auml;yrynen 2013: ch. 3.) The word <em>chaste</em> applies to a
certain kind of sexual restraint. It is typically used to convey
positive evaluation, perhaps that such restraint is good in a certain
way. If <em>chaste</em> is in fact objectionable and the (evaluative)
content that makes it so is semantically expressed, then nothing is
chaste; <em>chaste</em> is an empty term that fails to refer. If
instead the content that makes <em>chaste</em> objectionable is
truth-conditionally irrelevant, <em>chaste</em> may be true of things
which don&rsquo;t &ldquo;fit&rdquo; the evaluation; it will
&ldquo;misevaluate&rdquo;. Matti Eklund argues that objectionable
thick terms are not appropriately regarded as empty (Eklund 2011).</p>

<p>
Those who reject evaluation of sexual restraint as good and thus find
<em>chaste</em> objectionable in its customary positive use (call them
<em>chaste</em>-objectors) are reluctant to utter sentences like
(3):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="ex3">(3)</dt>
<dd>Isolde is chaste.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But <em>chaste</em>-objectors are also reluctant to utter (3) when it
is embedded in negation, questions, modal operators such as
<em>possibly</em> and <em>might</em>, and the antecedent of a
conditional:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="ex4ad">(4)</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Isolde isn&rsquo;t chaste.</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>Is Isolde chaste?</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>Isolde might be chaste.</dd>
<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>If Isolde is chaste, so is Tristan.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
None of
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>
 entail that Isolde is chaste. If the Semantic View were correct, none
should entail a positive evaluation either. What
<em>chaste</em>-objectors&rsquo; reluctance to utter
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>
 suggests is that the positive evaluation associated with
<em>chaste</em> &ldquo;projects&rdquo; outside of operators that block
semantically expressed content. Their reluctance to utter
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>
 thus seems hard to explain if (3) semantically expresses that
evaluation. This projection behavior is a general feature of
T-utterances, since virtually any thick term seems to be in principle
open to being regarded as objectionable. As we&rsquo;ll see in
 <a href="#PragView">section 4.2</a>
 below, this projection behavior is characteristic of various kinds of
secondary content.</p>

<p>
The Semantic View may, however, offer a different explanation of
projection data. One option is that T-utterances normally convey two
kinds of evaluation. Perhaps <em>chaste</em> is semantically
evaluative and, in addition, someone who uses the word thereby conveys
that she endorses or approves of the semantically associated positive
valuation. Insofar as this latter aspect projects out of embeddings
that block semantically expressed content and the reluctance of
<em>chaste</em>-objectors to utter
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>
 can be explained as being due only to the latter aspect, their
reluctance doesn&rsquo;t show that <em>chaste</em> isn&rsquo;t also
semantically evaluative (Eklund 2017). This proposal seems, however,
unable by itself to explain the defeasibility data discussed below,
which suggest that even the associated evaluations themselves can be
suspended without infelicity.</p>

<p>
Another explanation of projection data is due to Brent Kyle. It comes
in two pieces. The first concerns (4a). When you say someone is not
happy, you only say that they lack the quality of being happy, not
that they are unhappy. But normally, in the absence of an explicit
note to the contrary, we tend to interpret the claim that someone
isn&rsquo;t happy as conversationally implicating (conveying,
suggesting) that they are unhappy. It should then be equally plausible
that <em>not chaste</em> similarly conversationally implicates
<em>unchaste</em>. Since those who find <em>chaste</em> objectionable
should also be reluctant to imply that anyone is unchaste, this would
explain why <em>chaste</em>-objectors are reluctant to utter (4a). So
what about (4b&ndash;d)? To be a <em>chaste</em>-objector you must
have concluded that things aren&rsquo;t good simply for showing a
certain kind of sexual restraint. If the Semantic View is true, it
follows that nothing can be chaste; you regard <em>chaste</em> as an
empty term. But each of (4b&ndash;d) implies that the speaker
considers it a live possibility that Isolde is chaste. No wonder,
then, that <em>chaste</em>-objectors are reluctant to assert
(4b&ndash;d). Since these explanations focus on truth-conditionally
irrelevant implications of
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>,
 they are compatible with the Semantic View (Kyle 2013a: 13&ndash;19).
In appealing to two distinct types of implicature, this piecemeal
explanation is less parsimonious than views in section 4.2 that make
do with just one mechanism. Whether that makes the explanation worse
overall is a complex question up for debate. For example, Katherina
Felka and Nils Franz&eacute;n suggest a unified explanation of
projection data that appeals to the Gricean maxim of quantity (Felka
and Franz&eacute;n 2024: 6). (The general methodological issues here
are discussed in
 <a href="supplement.html#FurtCompBetwSemaPragView">section 3</a>
 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">&ldquo;Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance&rdquo;</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The second sort of data concern the possibility of denying or
suspending an evaluation that a T-utterance normally conveys without
rejecting the utterance itself. Semantically expressed contents cannot
be denied in this way. If I say &ldquo;Gerald asked three questions at
Heather&rsquo;s talk&rdquo; and you reply &ldquo;No, he asked
two&rdquo;, you reject my utterance as false. But if you reply
&ldquo;No, he asked four&rdquo;, you aren&rsquo;t rejecting the truth
of my utterance but only its conversational implicature that Gerald
asked <em>exactly</em> three questions. In
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex2">(2)</a>
 direct denials of evaluation following assertive T-utterances are
infelicitous, so they aren&rsquo;t directly cancellable. But consider
the following examples where the typical evaluation seems to be
suspended or cancelled in a less direct way:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="ex5">(5)</dt>
<dd>Whether or not Isolde is chaste, she is in no way (good / better)
for her sexual restraint. (Cf. V&auml;yrynen 2013: 66)</dd>
<dt id="ex6">(6)</dt>
<dd>Whether or not this is a good thing, Isolde can be truthfully and
neutrally described as being chaste. (Cf. Bergstr&ouml;m 2002: 5)</dd>
<dt id="ex7">(7)</dt>
<dd>The carnival was a lot of fun. But something was missing. It just
wasn&rsquo;t lewd. I hope it&rsquo;ll be lewd next year. (Due to Matti
Eklund)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some of these sentences may sound off if uttered in isolation. But the
relevant linguistic tests allow and often require priming a certain
kind of context. If these utterances can be acceptable at least with
suitable priming, that would be evidence that the evaluation normally
conveyed by <em>chaste</em> isn&rsquo;t a semantically expressed
primary content. A speaker of
 <a href="#ex7">(7)</a>
 makes it clear that she would rejoice in a more sexually explicit
carnival, thus shedding a commitment to evaluating the carnival
negatively if it were more explicit. If that evaluation were
semantically expressed by &lsquo;<em>x</em> is lewd&rsquo;, we would
expect
 <a href="#ex7">(7)</a>
 not to sound coherent on a literal use of <em>lewd</em>. The denial
in
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>
 and suspension in
 <a href="#ex6">(6)</a>
 don&rsquo;t concern only whether the speaker approves of the way of
valuing associated with the thick term but also that evaluation
itself. An utterance of
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>
 brackets the question of whether
 <a href="#ex3">(3)</a>
 is true and denies the evaluation either way. If you forced a
<em>chaste</em>-objector to judge
 <a href="#ex3">(3)</a>
 as either true or false, she might prefer to classify it as true
while using something like
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>
 to signal that she is using <em>chaste</em> non-evaluatively.
Uttering
 <a href="#ex6">(6)</a>
 would be a way for someone who is agnostic about whether chastity is
good in any way to suspend the evaluation while conceding
non-evaluative information that is semantically expressed by
 <a href="#ex3">(3)</a>.
 It isn&rsquo;t clear how either
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>
 or
 <a href="#ex6">(6)</a>
 could be compatible with the view that the relevant evaluation is a
primary content semantically expressed by
 <a href="#ex3">(3)</a>.
 So the proponents of the Semantic View may need to claim that
utterances of
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>&ndash;<a href="#ex7">(7)</a>
 either don&rsquo;t involve literal uses of thick terms or are
infelicitous despite the fact that many speakers don&rsquo;t find them
so. One radical way to try to reconcile the Semantic View with
defeasibility data might be to argue that objectionable thick terms
have inconsistent semantic content. On this view, <em>chaste</em>
might semantically entail <em>good for showing sexual restraint</em>
even if things to which <em>chaste</em> applies in fact aren&rsquo;t
good in any way and even if some semantically competent speakers
reject the evaluation without rejecting
 <a href="#ex1">(3)</a>.
 In discussing this view, Matti Eklund argues that it isn&rsquo;t
<em>ad hoc</em> because there are other concepts that can plausibly be
treated as inconsistent in this kind of way (Eklund 2011).</p>

<p>
Debates about whether the evaluations normally conveyed by thick terms
are defeasible quickly get complex and technical. Beyond the
complexity of the data as such, one further complication is that the
linguistic intuitions on which we rely in assessing competing
explanations may be less firm or not as widely shared as we would
like; (5)-(7) may be cases in point. Yet another is whether certain
kinds of denials of T-utterances focused on the evaluations that they
normally convey are better understood as instances of the
truth-conditional negation that we learn about in logic classes, or of
&ldquo;metalinguistic&rdquo; negation that may be used to target
certain aspects of utterances other than their primary content. A
fuller discussion of defeasibility data and their explanation can be
found in V&auml;yrynen (2013: 66&ndash;95). </p>

<h3 id="PragView">4.2 Secondary Content Views</h3>

<p>
Understanding how T-utterances might convey global evaluation without
semantically expressing it requires a brief look at how utterances can
in general communicate information that they don&rsquo;t semantically
express. Linguists and philosophers of language have identified
several such mechanisms of information transfer; chief among these are
various kinds of <em>implicature</em> and <em>presupposition</em> (see
the entries on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/">Implicature</a>
 and
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/presupposition/">Presupposition</a>).
 Each generates a possible view of how T-utterances convey evaluation
as some kind of <em>secondary content</em>. These Secondary Content
Views can be divided into two categories: Conventional Evaluation
Views according to which evaluation is conveyed due to the
conventional meaning of sentences containing thick terms and Pragmatic
Views according to which evaluation is conveyed due to some pragmatic
mechanisms or conversational principles. (For a fuller discussion of
these mechanisms in the context of thick terms, see V&auml;yrynen
2013: ch. 5.)</p>

<p>
Conventional Evaluation Views take T-utterances to convey global
evaluation either via <em>semantic presupposition</em> or
<em>conventional implicature</em> (Zakkou 2023). First consider a
standard example of presupposition:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>(8)</dt>
<dd><em>A</em>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret being a member of the
Communist party.&rdquo;
<br />
Presupposition: <em>A</em> was a member of the Communist party.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
How exactly semantic content and presupposition relate is a complex
topic. It is widely thought that presupposition failure deprives a
sentence of truth-value. But perhaps not all presupposition failure is
catastrophic in this way and some truth can be recovered (Yablo 2006).
Perhaps (8) can be a poor but intelligible way to put the truth that
<em>A</em> can&rsquo;t regret something she never did. Among writers
on thick concepts, Allan Gibbard and Gopal Sreenivasan speak of
evaluations conveyed by T-utterances as presuppositions, but without
developing the view in detail (Gibbard 1992; Sreenivasan 2001: 26).
More detailed and sophisticated developments of the view that
sentences containing thick terms semantically presuppose evaluation
can be found in Cepollaro and Stojanovic (2016) and Cepollaro (2020).
They construe the evaluative presupposition as presenting the things
falling under a negative thick term (say) as bad in a certain way; a
different option would be to construe it as expressing the
speaker&rsquo;s negative attitude toward the things in question. An
open question about this view is whether the relevant presuppositions
are better understood pragmatically, as conveying the speaker&rsquo;s
beliefs about the conversation&rsquo;s common ground, or semantically,
as something that expressions carry as part of their conventional
meaning. Linguists debate whether presupposition is in general better
thought of as a pragmatic or semantic phenomenon. If defeasibility
examples like (5)-(7) are acceptable, that may favor treating
evaluative presuppositions of T-utterances as pragmatic rather than
semantic, since pragmatic contents tend to be contextually defeasible
(V&auml;yrynen 2013: 115). Another worry about presupposition views
concerns <em>accommodation</em>. Presuppositions not already in the
common ground are expected to be added to it unless challenged. A
presuppositional utterance would then typically be conversationally
inappropriate if a speaker expects a challenge to the presupposition.
Utterances involving objectionable thick terms are like this: the
evaluations they convey typically have no prospect of being added to
the common ground of the conversation when some addressees are known
to find them objectionable (V&auml;yrynen 2013: 113). Yet such
utterances seem often to have a point. Resources for addressing these
concerns might, however, be available in the complex and subtle
contemporary work on presupposition in linguistics (cf. Cepollaro
2020: ch. 4; but also see Felka and Franz&eacute;n 2024:
8&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
Now consider a standard example of what Grice (1975) dubbed
&ldquo;conventional implicature&rdquo;:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="ex9">(9)</dt>
<dd><em>A</em>: &ldquo;Shaq is tall but agile.&rdquo;
<br />
Conventional implicature: Shaq&rsquo;s agility is unexpected given his
tallness.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There is significant consensus that &lsquo;Shaq is tall but
agile&rsquo; and &lsquo;Shaq is tall and agile&rsquo; are true in all
the same circumstances. But the latter doesn&rsquo;t communicate a
contrast between tallness and agility. The implicated contrast
proposition isn&rsquo;t part of the truth-conditions of
<em>B</em>&rsquo;s utterance. The implicature is widely regarded as
conventional because the contrast seems to be part of the conventional
meaning of <em>but</em> in English; a speaker who finds no difference
between what <em>and</em> and <em>but</em> communicate is in some
sense not fully competent with <em>but</em>.</p>

<p>
The example illustrates that a conventional implicature of an
expression is <em>detachable</em> from the expression: for any
expression that triggers a conventional implicature there is a readily
identifiable counterpart expression that has at least approximately
the same primary content but does not trigger the implicature (Grice
1975: 39). In
 <a href="#OughGapFactValuDist">section 2.1</a>
 we saw that according to R. M. Hare the evaluative content of thick
terms is detachable in this sense. But he doesn&rsquo;t say whether he
thinks that T-utterances are conventionally evaluative. One problem
for the conventional implicature view is that evaluation doesn&rsquo;t
seem detachable from T-utterances (V&auml;yrynen 2013: 101&ndash;2,
Felka and Franz&eacute;n 2024: 7). As noted earlier, an approximate
paraphrase in independently intelligible context-invariant
non-evaluative terms seems rarely to be available for thick terms.
Another problem is that conventional implicatures aren&rsquo;t
defeasible in ways reported in (5)&ndash;(7): &lsquo;Whether or not
Shaq&rsquo;s agility is unexpected given his tallness, Shaq is tall
but agile&rsquo; sounds outright infelicitous.</p>

<p>
The two Conventional Evaluation Views share certain merits. Both
presuppositions and conventional implicatures project in ways
suggested by
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>.
 These views also predict that
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 should sound odd: &lsquo;I regret being a member of the communist
party and I never was a member&rsquo; sounds close to contradictory,
and so does &ldquo;Shaq is tall but agile and his being agile
isn&rsquo;t unexpected given his tallness&rdquo;. How each view might
overcome the concerns flagged above remains a live issue. </p>

<p>
According to Pragmatic Views, T-utterances don&rsquo;t convey global
evaluation due to their conventional meaning but via some pragmatic
mechanism of information transfer. The best understood pragmatic
mechanism is what Grice (1975) dubbed &ldquo;conversational
implicature&rdquo;. Imagine the following conversation at the campus
cafeteria:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="ex10">(10)</dt>
<dd><em>A</em>: Are you coming to Jack&rsquo;s party?
<br />
<em>B</em>: I have to work.
<br />
Conversational implicature: <em>B</em> can&rsquo;t come to the
party.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The implicature isn&rsquo;t semantically expressed by
<em>B</em>&rsquo;s utterance. All that <em>B</em> says is that she has
to work. That doesn&rsquo;t become false if <em>B</em> attends the
party after all. The implicature is conversational because <em>A</em>
has to work it out from <em>B</em>&rsquo;s utterance by relying on
contextual observations and rules of cooperative communication, such
as that <em>B</em> wouldn&rsquo;t utter a sentence that isn&rsquo;t
directly relevant to <em>A</em>&rsquo;s question unless she was trying
to convey something that is relevant, namely that she won&rsquo;t be
coming to the party. (Grice 1975: 26&ndash;31.) Among writers on thick
concepts, Simon Blackburn occasionally suggests that T-utterances
conversationally implicate evaluation (Blackburn 1992; his 1998 is
harder to read this way; see also Zangwill 1995: 322). But this view
doesn&rsquo;t explain projection data: conversational implicatures
mostly don&rsquo;t survive embedding under negation, questions, and so
on, except by coincidence. (If <em>B</em> had uttered &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t have to work&rsquo;, she wouldn&rsquo;t have implicated
that she can&rsquo;t come to the party.) Nor does it explain
defeasibility data. One hallmark of conversational implicature is that
it is directly cancellable:</p>

<p>
(11) <em>A:</em> I have to work, but I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that
I won&rsquo;t be coming to the party.</p>

<p>
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s utterance in (11) sounds perfectly fine. We
don&rsquo;t observe the same with thick terms: </p>

<p>
(12) <em>A:</em> Isolde is chaste, but by that I&rsquo;m not saying
that she&rsquo;s (good / better) in any way. </p>

<p>
(13) <em>B:</em> Taking the last piece of cake is selfish, but I
don&rsquo;t mean to imply that it&rsquo;s bad in any way.</p>

<p>
The latter utterances are widely judged to sound bad (V&auml;yrynen
2013: 104&ndash;5, Kyle 2013a, Cepollaro and Stojanovic 2016, Zakkou
2023). Defeasibility behavior seems well suited for empirical study.
So far empirical study has focused on whether evaluation is directly
cancellable in the way that conversational implicatures are (Willemsen
and Reuter 2021). The results agree with the judgments just reported
about (12)&ndash;(13). But from this we cannot infer support for the
Semantic View (contra Willemsen and Reuter 2021). (12)&ndash;(13)
don&rsquo;t follow the pattern in (5)&ndash;(7). So even if direct
cancellation in (12)&ndash;(13) is infelicitous, relevant evaluations
may still be defeasible in less direct ways, such as those in
(5)&ndash;(7). Further empirical studies to test a wider range of
Secondary Content Views would be a welcome development in the
debate.</p>

<p>
Among other Pragmatic Views, above we touched on the hypothesis that
T-utterances pragmatically presuppose evaluation. This view seems to
lack advocates in print, but the pragmatic view developed by Pekka
V&auml;yrynen comes close. V&auml;yrynen notes that primary content is
commonly distinguished from implicated and presupposed content as what
typically is &ldquo;at issue&rdquo; in an utterance or constitutes its
main point, but that &ldquo;not-at-issue content&rdquo; needn&rsquo;t
be exhausted by conventional and conversational implicature and
semantic and pragmatic presupposition. For example, it seems possible
for utterances to convey information that projects and is defeasible
but whose conversational appropriateness doesn&rsquo;t require the
kind of accommodation that objectors deny to evaluations associated
with thick terms they regard as objectionable. V&auml;yrynen proposes
the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Not-At-Issue View:</em> Global evaluations are implications of
T-utterances that are normally &ldquo;not at issue&rdquo; in their
literal uses in normal contexts, and which arise conversationally.
(V&auml;yrynen 2013: 122)</p>
</div>

<p>
When someone calls Rihanna&rsquo;s show lewd, or Donald Trump&rsquo;s
stump speech unhinged, a negative evaluation of acts falling under
<em>lewd</em> or <em>unhinged</em> is a generalized implication of the
utterance in the sense that it is part of the standard or default
interpretation of such utterances, not a one-off occurrence. The
implication is not an implicature because it isn&rsquo;t directly
cancellable; in this, it is much like a pragmatic presupposition. Its
generalized status would be explained by widely shared discourse
assumptions to the effect that it isn&rsquo;t common in these parts to
use <em>chaste</em>, <em>cruel</em>, <em>generous</em>, and so on,
neutrally. It is common knowledge that those who use a given thick
term for the most part accept certain evaluations and their utterances
for the most part accurately reflect their acceptance of those
evaluations. (Such social facts may also help explain why thick terms
seem more intimately connected to evaluation than other non-evaluative
terms that are often used evaluatively, such as <em>chocolatey</em>
and <em>athletic</em>.) Evaluation is typically &ldquo;not at
issue&rdquo; in that it tends not to be the main point of a
T-utterance but rather is part of the background that the speaker
typically takes for granted in making the utterance&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t normally converse with those who object to our words. The
main point is typically to assert that something falls under the term,
against the background evaluation that things falling under the term
tend to be good or bad in a certain sort of way. However, evaluation
may become &ldquo;at issue&rdquo; in a conversation if it is
questioned, resisted, or challenged by a conversational participant.
Insofar as the presence of evaluation can be explained
conversationally, we can expect it to be open to be denied or
suspended by objectors and agnostics in the ways suggested by the
defeasibility data such as (5)&ndash;(7). It is a general feature of
various types of backgrounded content that they project in ways
illustrated by
 <a href="#ex4ad">(4a&ndash;d)</a>.
 (For more on the Not-At-Issue View, see V&auml;yrynen 2013: chs.
5&ndash;6.) It is worth noting that if pragmatic presupposition
requires accommodation only in what some linguists have come to call
&ldquo;speaker&rsquo;s context&rdquo; and not accommodation by her
interlocutors, then a correspondingly weak pragmatic presupposition
view seems to be a version of the Not-At-Issue View. The latter is
thus a kind of umbrella view: there may be various types of
not-at-issue content that projects, is defeasible, is conversationally
generated, and doesn&rsquo;t require accommodation by the audience.
</p>

<p>
If this kind of Pragmatic View is correct, thick concepts seem to lack
the broader significance that some have assigned to them. The
evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances will be separable from
thick terms in whatever way pragmatically conveyed not-at-issue
information is in general separable from the utterances that convey
them. If the conclusion that thick terms aren&rsquo;t semantically
evaluative shows that there are no irreducibly evaluative thick
concepts that we must possess in order to think about their subject
matter, thick concepts cannot undermine linguistic or conceptual
<em>is-ought</em> distinctions, force us to rethink reflection and
objectivity in ethics, or be conceptually or explanatorily prior to or
interdependent with thin concepts (V&auml;yrynen 2013: ch. 10).
However, the relationship between language and concepts is vexed in
this area, and may interfere with the implications of Secondary
Content Views for the significance of thick concepts. (For discussion,
see V&auml;yrynen 2013: 44&ndash;51; Zangwill 2013; Eklund 2017.) The
overall plausibility of Secondary Content Views depends on several
further issues besides explaining projection and defeasibility data.
One concerns other aspects of testability. Do Secondary Content Views
generate systematic predictions as to their non-evaluative
entailments, and how? Again, even approximate paraphrases of thick
terms in independently intelligible context-invariant non-evaluative
terms seem generally unavailable. If thick terms are
context-sensitive, their context-invariant entailments are likely to
be relatively unspecific. But more work is required to integrate an
analysis of thick terms as context-sensitive with the literature on
context-sensitivity. (All this goes also for any version of the
Semantic View on which the primary content that thick terms
semantically express is partly non-evaluative but separable.) Apart
from how to systematically generate testable consequences, it is
unclear whether any other context-sensitive terms have as systematic
an association with secondary contents as thick terms have with
evaluation. Another issue concerns the implications of Secondary
Content Views regarding thin terms. For instance, if thin terms were
also open to being regarded as objectionable, would that mean that the
behavior exhibited by objectionable thick terms in
 <a href="#SemaView">section 4.1</a>
 above supports some Secondary Content View of thin terms as well or
that it speaks against Secondary Content Views of thick terms and
concepts (cf. Eklund 2017)? Insofar as we are convinced that thin
terms are semantically evaluative, such a result would seem like bad
news for Secondary Content Views. (But see Sundell 2016, who argues
that thin aesthetic terms aren&rsquo;t inherently evaluative in
meaning, but are merely used evaluatively.) This leads us to our last
topic: how do thick and thin concepts differ from one another?</p>

<p>
For a summary of further comparisons between Semantic and Secondary
Content Views, see
 <a href="supplement.html#FurtCompBetwSemaPragView">section 3</a>

<h2 id="DeliQuesHowDoThicThinConcDiff">5. The Delineation Question: How Do Thick and Thin Concepts Differ?</h2>

<p>
A crucial feature of the intuitive characterization of thick terms and
concepts with which we began is that they differ from the thin with
respect to the non-evaluative information each encode. Even if cruel
acts are bad, not all bad acts can be cruel. The standard explanation
of this is that cruel acts are distinguished from other bad acts by
certain non-evaluative qualities. The thickening agent in thick terms
is non-evaluative description. This contrast with the thin may be
understood in two kinds of ways: as a difference in kind, or as a
difference in degree. As we consider each option in turn, we&rsquo;ll
see that the question of how thick and thin terms and concepts differ
may well have no theory-neutral answer.</p>

<p>
One way for thick and thin to differ in kind would be for thin terms
to express purely evaluative concepts and for thick terms to express
concepts that aren&rsquo;t purely evaluative but encode also
non-evaluative information. An early version of this proposal is due
to Bernard Williams: thin terms are wholly action-guiding whereas
thick terms are both action-guiding and world-guided (Williams 1985:
152). His particular version is problematic: the notion of
action-guidingness isn&rsquo;t as clear as one would like and many
philosophers take also thin terms to be world-guided in the sense that
their application depends at least in part on how the world is. (For a
more recent version, see Dancy 2013: 47&ndash;51.) In its general
form, this proposal presupposes the Semantic View but is available to
both Separabilists and Inseparabilists. Similarly, although Williams
denies Thin Centralism concerning the relations of conceptual and
explanatory priority between thick and thin concepts, the general
proposal could be combined with Thin Centralism or the No Priority
view. A potential problem for it is that it isn&rsquo;t clear whether
all paradigmatic thin concepts are wholly evaluative, given the
intuitive idea that thick terms are those that somehow involve both
evaluation and non-evaluative description. If <em>ought</em> implies
<em>can</em> as a conceptual or analytic matter, then its application
will be restricted by the non-evaluative condition that the agent is
able to perform the action (V&auml;yrynen 2013: 7). In that case
<em>ought</em> wouldn&rsquo;t look descriptively much thinner than
some terms that are often classified as thick. The application of
<em>admirable</em>, for instance, is non-evaluatively constrained only
by the non-evaluative features of admiration. As noted in
 <a href="#InseView">section 3.2</a>,
 not all entailments of an expression are encoded in its meaning and
it isn&rsquo;t always straightforward to determine which are. But
competence with at least certain concepts that <em>ought</em> can be
used to express may well require that if we think you ought to do
something, we would accept that you can do it if the question came up.
Another way to think that thick and thin differ in kind is generated
by Secondary Content Views. These views entail that thick terms
don&rsquo;t semantically express (global) evaluation. Insofar as thin
terms do semantically express evaluation, they would then differ in
kind from the thick. Here the difference in kind would be such as to
support Non-Centralism. </p>

<p>
The second view about the relationship between thick and thin is that
they differ only in degree, not in kind. Samuel Scheffler suggests
this view in objecting to Bernard Williams&rsquo;s claim that thick
and thin differ in kind. He observes that there are many evaluative
terms that are hard to classify as either thick or thin, such as
<em>just</em>, <em>fair</em>, <em>impartial</em>, <em>rights</em>,
<em>autonomy</em>, <em>well-being</em>, and <em>consent</em>. They are
less rich in non-evaluative content than terms such as <em>cruel</em>
or <em>tactful</em>, although richer than <em>good</em> or
<em>right</em>. But if descriptive thickness is a matter of degree,
then perhaps a binary division of evaluative concepts into thick and
thin is an &ldquo;oversimplification&rdquo; (Scheffler 1987:
417&ndash;8). We might instead think of the distinction in terms of a
continuum of descriptive thickness or specificity, where
Scheffler&rsquo;s examples lie between paradigmatic thick and thin
terms. On the thin end we might either allow that some thin terms are
purely evaluative and treat them as a limiting case, or we might hold
that even the maximally thin concepts are a little bit thick. Those
holding the latter view have advocated either Thin Centralism (Smith
2013) or Thick Centralism (Chappell 2013), but the latter view, unlike
the former, seems compatible also with the No Priority View.</p>

<p>
Whatever the merits of this view about how thick and thin differ only
in degree, it doesn&rsquo;t follow simply from conceding that
evaluative terms may be descriptively thick to varying degrees. This
concession allows a binary distinction between purely thin evaluative
concepts and thick evaluative concepts that are characterized by
having some or other degree of non-evaluative content (cf. Dancy 2013:
48&ndash;9). More definite conclusions about Scheffler&rsquo;s
proposal would require reflection on whether his examples could
plausibly belong to a separate third category of evaluative terms that
are neither thick nor thin, and on whether a principled distinction
can be drawn between different kinds of non-evaluative content. In the
latter case a paradigmatic thin term such as <em>ought</em> might be a
little bit thick if it implied <em>can</em>, and yet lack a kind of
non-evaluative content that is possessed only by thick terms proper.
Perhaps, for instance, the non-evaluative aspects of <em>tactful</em>
and <em>cruel</em> distinguish their meanings from other evaluative
terms in a way that <em>can</em> doesn&rsquo;t do with
<em>ought</em>.</p>

<p>
If thin terms semantically express evaluation, then any version of the
difference-in-degree view requires that the Semantic View is true of
thick terms. It fits with Secondary Content Views only if these take
thick and thin terms both to be related to the evaluations they convey
in the same way (whether as a matter of presupposition, implicature,
or some kind of not-at-issue content). Either way it will be a further
question whether the view is best combined with Thin Centralism, Thick
Centralism, No Priority View or Non-Centralism. Again the question
whether thick and thin differ in degree or in kind has no
theory-neutral answer but depends on the correct substantive theory of
thick terms and concepts.</p>

<p>
A final proposal we&rsquo;ll consider can be developed either as
saying that thick and thin terms differ in kind or that they differ in
degree. R. M. Hare denies that thin terms are purely evaluative;
actual usages of thin terms like <em>good</em> will always carry some
descriptive meaning. Instead, thick and thin terms both incorporate
evaluative and non-evaluative information. The difference is that thin
terms have their evaluative meaning &ldquo;more firmly attached&rdquo;
to them than their non-evaluative meaning, whereas thick terms have
their non-evaluative meaning &ldquo;more firmly attached&rdquo; to
them than their evaluative meaning (Hare 1963: 24&ndash;25; see also
the distinction between primarily and secondarily evaluative words in
Hare 1952: 121&ndash;2). The idea is that evaluative terms can be
distinguished in terms of which sort of meaning is less likely to
change when speakers alter their usage of a term. If
<em>laissez-faire</em> capitalists begin to use <em>selfish</em>
positively, we are much more likely to still understand them than if
they started using <em>selfish</em> to describe generous acts. We
would be less likely to be accused of misusing <em>kind</em> and
<em>generous</em> if we began to use them negatively to condemn
bleeding hearts than if we started using them to describe cruel and
selfish acts. Hare takes this to suggest that the non-evaluative
meanings of thick terms are more firmly attached to them than their
evaluative meanings. Thin terms display the opposite behavior. We will
understand those who use <em>good</em> to evaluate promise-breaking,
torture, and enslavement of their enemies positively, whereas we would
be liable to be misunderstood or accused of misusing the word if we
started using <em>good</em> to express negative evaluations of helping
and respecting others. Such descriptive ossification of thin terms,
while not impossible, would seem very much like an exception rather
than the rule. (Hare 1952: 123 notes that <em>a good effluent</em>
functions as a descriptive technical term in sewage disposal manuals.)
So the evaluative meanings of thin terms (in particular, their
action-guiding function) seem to be more firmly attached to them than
their non-evaluative meanings.</p>

<p>
Hare&rsquo;s proposal seems quite ecumenical. If you worry that the
talk of evaluative and non-evaluative meanings suggests that
Hare&rsquo;s proposal is committed to Separability, note that it can
be reformulated as follows: thick and thin terms are typically used to
perform two kinds of speech acts, describing and evaluating, and they
differ with respect to how likely a speaker is to be misunderstood or
accused of misusing the term if one or the other of these speech acts
is changed. For instance, a speaker who uses <em>selfish</em> to
evaluate positively acts which we typically describe as selfish would
be more likely to be understood than a speaker who uses
<em>selfish</em> to describe generous acts and evaluate them
negatively, whereas the opposite pattern holds for thin terms. This
version of the proposal seems compatible with Inseparability. Nor does
the proposal seem to entail either the Semantic View or any
Conventional Evaluation variant of Secondary Content Views. Instead of
taking evaluative and non-evaluative meanings both to be semantic
meanings, the less firmly attached meaning can be taken as a speaker
meaning instead. One way to interpret Hare&rsquo;s distinction between
primarily and secondarily evaluative words is that the latter carry
evaluation only as a speaker meaning whereas the former carry
non-evaluative description only as a speaker meaning (Hare 1952:
121&ndash;4). Various Pragmatic Views are well suited to treating the
evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances as speaker meanings that
are to be explained in the pragmatics. Here we can finally ask whether
Hare&rsquo;s proposal makes thick and thin different in kind or
degree. You might think the latter: how firmly two things are attached
is a matter of degree. However, the distinction between semantic and
speaker meaning makes a difference-in-kind reading available. If the
non-evaluative meanings of thick terms are semantic meanings and their
evaluative meanings are speaker meanings but thin terms work the other
way around, then Hare&rsquo;s proposal regarding what kind of meanings
thick and thin terms are more firmly attached to would be a difference
in kind.</p>

<p>
Recent empirical work has brought to light further interesting
questions about the relation between thick and thin terms. Existing
philosophical work on thick terms and concepts largely assumes that
positive and negative thick terms behave in parallel ways. But some
recent survey studies suggest a <em>polarity effect:</em> the
evaluative content of positive thick terms like <em>friendly</em> and
<em>courageous</em> is more easily cancellable than the evaluative
content of negative terms like <em>rude</em> and <em>selfish
</em>(Willemsen and Reuter 2021). However, the effect may extend to
thin terms like <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em> (Baumgartner <em>et
al</em>. 2024). What a pervasive asymmetry between positive and
negative evaluative terms would mean for debates about thick terms
(such as the location and combination questions) and their relation to
the thin seems to depend a great deal on its source. Baumgartner
<em>et al.</em> (2024: 2169&ndash;71) briefly discuss several possible
explanations. Many of them seem not to support any particular view on
the semantics of thick terms. One example are explanations that appeal
to differences in the social norms governing the public attribution of
negative or blameworthy aspects and positive or praiseworthy aspects
to other people. In addition to studies based on surveys of speaker
judgments, there have been initial explorations of corpus-based
approaches. Reuter <em>et al.</em> (2024) observe that we currently
lack reliable means to identify evaluative concepts. Using large-scale
corpora, they suggest that the modifiers <em>truly</em> and
<em>really</em> frequently highlight the evaluative dimension of both
thick and thin adjectives by modifying their evaluative intensity.
This might allow thick and thin terms to be uniquely classified
together as evaluative terms. Further work may be required to assess
whether these results are robust across a richer comparison class of
descriptive adjectives of different semantic types. </p>

<p>
There are further underexplored linguistic similarities between
adjectival thick and thin terms. Adjectives like <em>selfish</em>,
<em>courageous</em>, <em>good</em>, and <em>bad</em> are all
<em>gradable:</em> I may be <em>more selfish</em> than you and you may
be <em>extremely courageous</em> whereas I am only <em>somewhat
courageous </em>(V&auml;yrynen 2013: 170&ndash;2, Cepollaro and
Stojanovic 2016: 471, Cepollaro 2020: 24&ndash;5). It is a live
question whether these formal similarities hide significant
differences, and what those might be. Many issues in this vicinity
remain poorly understood. How are the scales associated with (for
example) <em>courageous</em> and <em>good</em> (in its moral uses) to
be understood, given that substantive evaluative issues about courage
and moral goodness aren&rsquo;t to be settled in semantics, and do
these scales exhibit significant differences? Are there any systematic
patterns in whether various thick and thin terms measure some single
dimension (e.g. prioritizing one&rsquo;s own interests, in the case of
<em>selfish</em>) or some potentially multidimensional property (e.g.
whether selfishness is some combination of financial, emotional, and
other forms of self-prioritization that need somehow to be aggregated
into overall evaluations as selfish)? Are there any systematic
differences in how the scales are generated: by the world, by our
attitudes, some mixture thereof, or somehow else altogether? If there
are systematic differences, what do they tell us about the thick and
the thin and how they are related? And if there are no systematic
differences, what does <em>that</em> tell us? Some questions here may
concern specific thick terms. For example, how do we explain common
virtue-ethical ideas about virtue and vice concepts, such as that
being reckless isn&rsquo;t the same as being too courageous while also
explaining various important relations between courage, recklessness,
and cowardice? Existing work barely touches the surface of these and
related issues (V&auml;yrynen 2013: 180&ndash;3). </p>

For a summary of how thick terms and concepts relate to a further sort
of evaluative terms, pejoratives, see
 <a href="supplement.html#ThicTermPejo">section 4</a>
 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">&ldquo;Additional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance&rdquo;</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="ThicConcOutsEthi">6. Thick Concepts Outside of Ethics</h2>

<p>
Thick concepts have been a stable topic of debate among moral
philosophers since the seminal discussion in Williams (1985) and have
enjoyed something of a resurgence in ethics since 2010 or so. Thick
concepts are also receiving increasing attention in such other areas
of philosophy as epistemology, aesthetics, legal philosophy, and more.
(Such attention is often motivated, as in ethics, by dissatisfaction
with the extant state of the field.)</p>

<p>
For some while now, aestheticians and philosophers of art have paid
attention to thick aesthetic concepts such as garish, delicate, and
balanced, in addition to thin(ner) concepts such as beautiful and
ugly. Some of these discussions go back to the 1950s, predating the
post-Williams debate in ethics, but concern some of the same issues
even if they don&rsquo;t use the label &ldquo;thick&rdquo; (Beardsley
1982 and Sibley 2001; see also Burton 1992 and Zangwill 1995). Also
relevant is the recent attention to &ldquo;dual character
concepts&rdquo; (section 1) in art (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2020).
Discussions of thick aesthetic concepts often mirror discussions in
ethics about whether thick terms are evaluative as a matter of
truth-conditions or only pragmatically (recent examples includes
Bonzon 2009, Zangwill 2013, and Stojanovic 2016). Of particular
interest and potentially broader significance is the emerging
exploration of whether also thin aesthetic terms might be plausibly
treated as only pragmatically evaluative (Sundell 2016).</p>

<p>
There has been increasing attention in epistemology to thick epistemic
concepts such as gullible, quick to jump to conclusions, and
open-minded. This is particularly common in virtue epistemology, which
seeks to explain epistemic properties such as knowledge and justified
belief in terms of the cognizer&rsquo;s intellectual virtues and
vices. Whether focusing on thick epistemic concepts can lead to a
preferable epistemology is the topic of several papers in a special
issue of the journal <em>Philosophical Papers</em> (Kotzee and
Wanderer 2008; see also Battaly 2001). A foundational question here is
whether there is a distinction between thick and thin epistemic
concepts and whether it is to be understood in the same way as the
distinction between thick and thin ethical concepts (V&auml;yrynen
2008; Roberts 2018a). For instance, are thick epistemic concepts
supposed to be thick in the sense that they involve evaluation and
non-evaluative description, or in the sense that they involve
epistemic and non-epistemic content? (These are different distinctions
even if epistemic content is often evaluative and non-epistemic
content often non-evaluative.) These discussions almost invariably
assume that knowledge is a thin concept. But Brent Kyle argues that
knowledge is better understood as a thick concept and uses its
thickness to cast light on why the so-called Gettier problem for
definitions of knowledge arises (Kyle 2013b).</p>

<p>
Beyond ethics, aesthetics, and epistemology, attention to thick
concepts has been more scattered. In legal philosophy, David Enoch and
Kevin Toh suggest not only that legal statements often express
concepts that seem thick, such as crime and inheritance, but also that
legal is itself a thick concept. Specifically, it involves both a
representation of certain social facts and a kind of evaluative
endorsement. Treating legal as a thick concept allows debates about
the nature of law to draw on the broader philosophical context of
debates about thick concepts in ethics, and in this way has potential
to introduce new input into and options for thinking about the nature
of law. (Enoch and Toh 2013.) In logic, Sophia Arbeiter argues that
validity is a thick concept (Arbeiter 2023). In metaphysics, Gideon
Yaffe argues that if we treat free will will as a thick concept that
involves positive evaluation of items that fall under it, we are
better able to explain certain facts about freedom of will than if we
proceed with the more standard assumption that freedom of will is a
non-evaluative concept (Yaffe 2000). Philosophers of science have more
widely recognized the presence of thick concepts in science, such as
wellbeing, resilience, biodiversity, sustainability, and vulnerability
(see e.g. Dupr&eacute; 2007). More recent discussion focuses on
responsible scientific practice regarding the evaluative judgments or
standards that are implicated in the measurement of the phenomena
picked out by scientific thick concepts (Alexandrova and Fabian 2022).
Finally, the idea of a thick concept has also been invoked to do
significant work in various areas of applied philosophy. Empirical
research on moral judgment in psychology and neuroscience may be
criticized for having restricted its studies to judgments involving
thin concepts and ignoring thick concepts, especially if thick
concepts are irreducibly thick (Abend 2011; see also FitzGerald and
Goldie 2012). In environmental ethics, classifying concepts such as
ecological integrity as thick might be thought to buttress their
normative significance (Shockley 2012). In risk theory, arguing that
concepts of risk and safety are thick might help to show how these
concepts can be evaluative without being socially constructed
(M&ouml;ller 2012). Outside of philosophy, it has been suggested that
sociological research into specific groups&rsquo; or societies&rsquo;
repertoires of thick concepts can deliver insights into how thick
concepts work which cannot be obtained from the armchair and provide
access to important aspects of social life which aren&rsquo;t
accessible via thin concepts (Abend 2019). Time will tell whether
attention to thick terms or concepts will come to make a greater
impact in these and other areas.</p>

<p>
Attention to thick concepts in various areas of philosophy is often
inspired by dissatisfaction with dominant lines of research and the
hope that attention to thick concepts will redirect the work in these
areas. We have seen that cashing out this hope often requires
substantial assumptions regarding issues such as the
anti-disentangling argument, shapelessness, the inseparability of
evaluation and description, and whether evaluation is located in the
semantics or pragmatics of thick discourse. A plausible theory of
thick concepts may then not give thick concepts the significance their
fans take them to have, and either way these assumptions attract
substantial resistance in their own right. On the other hand, those
who find thick concepts to have little distinctive significance
nonetheless must ensure that evaluative and normative thought and talk
can be accounted for in terms of thin terms and concepts in a way that
addresses the concerns that inspire interest in the thicks. Any
complete theory of normativity and value must therefore reckon somehow
or other with the issues concerning thick terms and concepts discussed
in this entry.</p>
