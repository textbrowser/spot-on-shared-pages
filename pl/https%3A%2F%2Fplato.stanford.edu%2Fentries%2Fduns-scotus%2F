<h1>John Duns Scotus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu May 31, 2001; substantive revision Mon Dec 15, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
John Duns Scotus (1263/66&ndash;1308) was one of the most important
and influential philosopher-theologians of the High Middle Ages. His
brilliantly complex and nuanced thought, which earned him the
honorific &ldquo;the Subtle Doctor,&rdquo; left a mark on discussions
of such disparate topics as the semantics of religious language, the
problem of universals, divine illumination, and the nature of human
freedom. This essay first lays out what is known about Scotus&rsquo;s
life and the dating of his works. It then offers an overview of some
of his key positions in four main areas of philosophy: natural
theology, metaphysics, the theory of knowledge, and ethics and moral
psychology.</p>

<h2><a id="LifWor">1. Life and Works</a></h2>

<h3><a id="LifJohDunSco">1.1 The life of John Duns the Scot</a></h3>

<p>
(For a detailed account of what we know about Scotus&rsquo;s life and
career, see Dumont 2023; this section relies extensively on
Dumont.)</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Scotus&rsquo; identifies Scotus as a Scot. His family name was
Duns, which was also the name of the Scottish village in which he was
born, just a few miles from the English border. We do not know exactly
when he was born. The date has been traditionally given as 1265/1266,
based on the inference that Scotus&rsquo;s ordination to the
priesthood on 17 March 1291 would have taken place as soon as possible
after he reached the canonical minimum age of 25. But Stephen Dumont
(2023) has shown convincingly that Scotus&rsquo;s ordination records
strongly suggest he was in fact a bit older than that; a birth year of
1263 or 1264 is therefore likely.</p>

<p>
The statutes of the Franciscan order required that in order to become
a master of theology at Paris, as Scotus eventually would, one had to
have spent four years in the order&rsquo;s Paris lectorate, a program
of advanced study intended to prepare candidates to return to their
home provinces as lecturers in the order&rsquo;s <em>studia</em>
(houses of study). Scotus&rsquo;s period in the lectorate was likely
in the mid to late 1280s, following two years teaching philosophy in
the order&rsquo;s <em>studium</em> in Cambridge. After his Paris
lectorate Scotus went to Oxford to begin his theological studies,
probably in the academic year 1290&ndash;1291; his ordination record
confirms that he was in Oxford in 1291. After seven years of
preparatory study, Scotus was eligible to be admitted as a bachelor of
theology (that is, to lecture on the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter
Lombard). Scotus&rsquo;s original Oxford lectures on the
<em>Sentences</em>, known as the <em>Lectura</em>, were given in the
academic year 1298&ndash;1299. We know from Scotus himself that he had
begun the expansion of those lectures into what we know as the
<em>Ordinatio</em> by June 1300. He continued to work on the
<em>Ordinatio</em> for the rest of his life, leaving it uncompleted at
his death.</p>

<p>
In June 1302 the Minister General of the Franciscan order, John of
Morrovalle, designated Scotus as the order&rsquo;s next lecturer on
the <em>Sentences</em> at Paris. Scotus began his lectures in October
1302. The standard course of lectures took one academic year and
proceeded through the four books of the <em>Sentences</em> in the
order I-IV-II-III. Scotus&rsquo;s commentary on Book III ends with d.
17. It was not unusual for commentaries on Book III to be rushed or
left incomplete&mdash;the problem of running out of time to get
through the whole syllabus by the end of term is not a new
one&mdash;but there was an additional reason that Scotus did not make
it to the end of Book III. The king of France, Philip IV (&ldquo;the
Fair&rdquo;), was involved in a bitter dispute with the pope, Boniface
VIII. On June 24 and 25, 1303, royal agents took a census of the
Franciscan community to record who was on the king&rsquo;s side and
who was on the pope&rsquo;s. Scotus, along with most of the other
friars who were not from France, was on the pope&rsquo;s side; a royal
edict gave the non-adherents three days to leave France.
Scotus&rsquo;s Parisian lectures on Book III were thereby ended.</p>

<p>
Scotus spent his exile back at Oxford, lecturing again on Book III,
and then returned to Paris for the academic year 1304&ndash;1305. On
18 November 1304 the Franciscan Minister General, Gonsalvus of Spain,
wrote a letter selecting Scotus as the next Franciscan master of
theology at Paris, commending Scotus for his &ldquo;laudable life,
superb knowledge, most subtle intellect, and other fine qualities,
about which I am fully informed, partly by long experience and partly
by his reputation, which has spread everywhere&rdquo; (Dumont 2023,
35). Scotus then served as <em>magister iunior</em> in 1305&ndash;1306
and as <em>magister regens</em> in 1306&ndash;1307, holding his one
quodlibetal disputation in either Advent 1306 or Lent 1307.</p>

<p>
It was standard practice for the Franciscans to transfer masters out
of Paris after a year as <em>magister regens</em>, and Scotus was
accordingly transferred to the <em>studium generale</em> in Cologne,
&ldquo;no doubt to raise the standard of teaching in the convent
school&rdquo; (Dumont 2023, 40). He presumably arrived for the
beginning of the academic year 1307&ndash;1308. He was not to be in
Cologne for long, however; he died 8 November 1308.</p>

<h3><a id="ScoWor">1.2 Scotus&rsquo;s works</a></h3>

<p>
It is generally agreed that Scotus&rsquo;s earliest works were his
commentaries on the Old Logic: questions on Porphyry&rsquo;s
<em>Isagoge</em> and Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>, two sets
of questions on <em>Peri hermeneias</em>, and <em>De sophisticis
elenchis</em>. These probably date to Scotus&rsquo;s time teaching
philosophy at Cambridge. The <em>Quaestiones super II. et III. De
anima</em> and the <em>Quaestiones super libros Metaphysicorum
Aristotelis</em> were probably both started early but were revised
over the course of Scotus&rsquo;s career: Books VI through IX of the
<em>Metaphysics</em> commentary are all late or were at least revised
later, and some questions of the <em>De anima</em> commentary
&ldquo;show influences from his later theological works&rdquo; (Dumont
2023, 21). Scotus also wrote an exposition of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Metaphysics</em>, known as the <em>Notabilia super
Metaphysicam</em> or <em>Notabilia Scoti</em>.</p>

<p>
Things really get complicated when we come to Scotus&rsquo;s
commentaries on the four books of <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard,
since he commented on the <em>Sentences</em> more than once and
revised his lectures over a long period; the relations among the
various versions that have come down to us are not always clear.
Certainly the <em>Lectura</em> presents us with Scotus&rsquo;s Oxford
lectures on Books I&ndash;III of the <em>Sentences</em> in
1298&ndash;99. There is an <em>Ordinatio</em> (i.e., a version
prepared for publication by the author himself) of the lectures at
Oxford, based in part on the <em>Lectura</em> and on material from his
lectures in Paris. The <em>Ordinatio</em>, which Scotus seems to have
been revising up to his death, is generally taken to be Scotus&rsquo;s
premier work; the critical edition was at last completed in 2013.
Finally, Scotus lectured on the <em>Sentences</em> at Paris, and there
are various <em>Reportationes</em> (student reports) of these
lectures. A critical edition is in progress; at present we have a
preliminary edition of Books I and IV. Although the Paris lectures
themselves were later than the Oxford lectures, it seems probable that
parts of the <em>Ordinatio</em>&mdash;Book IV and perhaps also Book
III&mdash;are later than the corresponding parts of the
<em>Reportatio</em>.</p>

<p>
In addition to these works, we have a number of short disputations
called <em>Collationes</em>, one set from Oxford (1300&ndash;1301) and
one from Paris (1304&ndash;1305); a disputed question on the formal
distinction, <em>De formalitatibus</em>, often called the <em>Logica
Scoti</em> (1305&ndash;1307); a late work in natural theology called
<em>De primo principio;</em> and <em>Quaestiones Quodlibetales</em>
from Scotus&rsquo;s days as regent master (either Advent 1306 or Lent
1307). Finally, there is a work called <em>Theoremata</em>. Though
doubts have been raised about its authenticity, the recent critical
edition accepts it as a genuine work of Scotus.</p>

<h2><a id="NatThe">2. Natural Theology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="SomMetPre">2.1 Some methodological preliminaries</a></h3>

<p>
Natural theology is, roughly, the effort to establish the existence
and nature of God by arguments that in no way depend on the contents
of a purported revelation. But is it even <em>possible</em> for human
beings to come to know God apart from revelation? Scotus certainly
thinks so. Like any good Aristotelian, he thinks all our knowledge
begins in some way with our experience of sensible things. But he is
confident that even from such humble beginnings we can come to grasp
God.</p>

<p>
Scotus agrees with Thomas Aquinas that all our knowledge of God starts
from creatures, and that as a result we can only prove the existence
and nature of God by what the medievals call an argument <em>quia</em>
(reasoning from effect to cause), not by an argument <em>propter
quid</em> (reasoning from essence to characteristic). Aquinas and
Scotus further agree that, for that same reason, we cannot know the
essence of God in this life. The main difference between the two
authors is that Scotus believes we can apply certain predicates
univocally&mdash;with exactly the same meaning&mdash;to God and
creatures, whereas Aquinas insists that this is impossible, and that
we can only use analogical predication, in which a word as applied to
God has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of
that same word as applied to creatures. (See
 <a href="../analogy-medieval/">medieval theories of analogy</a>
 for details.)</p>

<p>
Scotus has a number of arguments for univocal predication and against
the doctrine of analogy (<em>Ordinatio</em> 1, d. 3, pars 1, q.
1&ndash;2, nn. 26&ndash;55). One of the most compelling uses
Aquinas&rsquo;s own view against him. Aquinas had said that all our
concepts come from creatures. Scotus says, very well, where will that
analogous concept come from? It can&rsquo;t come from anywhere. If all
our concepts come from creatures (and Scotus doesn&rsquo;t deny this),
then the concepts we apply to God will also come from creatures. They
won&rsquo;t just be <em>like</em> the concepts that come from
creatures, as in analogous predication; they will have to be <em>the
very same</em> concepts that come from creatures, as in univocal
predication. Those are the only concepts we can have&mdash;the only
concepts we can possibly get. So if we can&rsquo;t use the concepts we
get from creatures, we can&rsquo;t use any concepts at all, and so we
can&rsquo;t talk about God&mdash;which is false.</p>

<p>
Another argument for univocal predication is based on an argument from
Anselm. Consider all predicates, Anselm says. Now get rid of the ones
that are merely relatives, since no relative expresses the nature of a
thing as it is in itself. (So we&rsquo;re not talking about such
predicates as &ldquo;supreme being&rdquo; or &ldquo;Creator,&rdquo;
since even though those properly apply to God, they don&rsquo;t tell
us anything about what God is in himself, only about how he is related
to other things.) Now take the predicates that are left. Here&rsquo;s
the test. Let <em>F</em> be our predicate-variable. For any
<em>F</em>, either</p>

<p class="indent">
(a) It is in every respect better to be <em>F</em> than not to be
<em>F</em>.
<br />
~or~
<br />
(b) It is in some respect better to be not-<em>F</em> than
<em>F</em>.</p>

<p>
A predicate will fall into the second category if and only if it
implies some sort of limitation or deficiency. Anselm&rsquo;s argument
is that we can (indeed must) predicate of God every predicate that
falls into the first category, and that we cannot predicate of God any
predicate that falls into the second (except metaphorically, perhaps).
Scotus agrees with Anselm on this point (as did Aquinas: see
<em>SCG</em> I.30). Scotus has his own terminology for whatever it is
in every respect better to be than not to be. He calls such things
&ldquo;pure perfections&rdquo; (<em>perfectiones simpliciter</em>). A
pure perfection is any predicate that does not imply limitation.</p>

<p>
So Scotus claims that pure perfections can be predicated of God. But
he takes this a step further than Anselm. He says that they have to be
predicated <em>univocally</em> of God; otherwise the whole business of
pure perfections won&rsquo;t make any sense. Here&rsquo;s the
argument. If we are going to use Anselm&rsquo;s test, we must first
come up with our concept&mdash;say, of good. Then we check out the
concept to see whether it is in every respect better to be good than
not-good. We realize that it is, and so we predicate
&lsquo;good&rsquo; of God. That test obviously won&rsquo;t work unless
it&rsquo;s the same concept that we&rsquo;re applying in both
cases.</p>

<p>
One can see this more clearly by considering the two possible ways in
which one might deny that the same concept is applied to both God and
creatures. One might say that the concept of the pure perfection
applies only to creatures, and the concept we apply to God has to be
something different; or one might try it the other way around and say
that the concept of the pure perfection applies only to God, and the
concept we apply to creatures has to be something different. Take the
first possibility. If we come up with the idea of a pure perfection
from creatures and don&rsquo;t apply the same concept to God,
we&rsquo;re saying that we can come up with something that is in every
respect better to be than not to be, but it doesn&rsquo;t apply to
God. Such a view would destroy the idea that God is the greatest and
most perfect being. So then one might try the second possibility: the
concept of the pure perfection really applies only to God. Scotus
points out that that can&rsquo;t be right either. For then the
perfection we apply to creatures won&rsquo;t be the pure perfection
any more, and so the creature wouldn&rsquo;t be better off for having
this pseudo-perfection. But the whole way in which we came up with the
idea of the pure perfection in the first place was by considering
perfections in creatures&mdash;in other words, by considering what
features made creatures better in every respect. So this possibility
gets the test backwards: it says that we have to start with knowing
what features God has and thereby determining what is a pure
perfection, but in fact we first figure out what the pure perfections
are and thereby know what features God has.</p>

<p>
Not only can we come up with concepts that apply univocally to God and
creatures, we can even come up with a <em>proper</em> (distinctive)
concept of God. Now in one sense we can&rsquo;t have a proper concept
of God in this life, since we can&rsquo;t know his essence as a
particular thing. We know God in the way that we know, say, a person
we have heard about but have never met. That is, we know him through
general concepts that can apply both to him and to other things. In
another sense, though, we can have a proper concept of God, that is,
one that applies only to God. If we take any of the pure perfections
to the highest degree, they will be predicable of God alone. Better
yet, we can describe God more completely by taking all the pure
perfections in the highest degree and attributing them all to him.</p>

<p>
But these are all composite concepts; they all involve putting two
quite different notions together: &lsquo;highest&rsquo; with
&lsquo;good,&rsquo; &lsquo;first&rsquo; with &lsquo;cause,&rsquo; and
so on. Scotus says that we can come up with a relatively
<em>simple</em> concept that is proper to God alone, the concept of
&ldquo;infinite being.&rdquo; Now that concept might seem to be every
bit as composite as &ldquo;highest good&rdquo; or &ldquo;first
cause,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s really not. For &ldquo;infinite
being&rdquo; is a concept of something essentially one: a being that
has infinity (unlimitedness) as its intrinsic way of existing. We will
return to the crucial role of the concept of infinite being in
Scotus&rsquo;s natural theology after we examine his proof of the
existence of God.</p>

<h3><a id="ProExiGod">2.2 Proof of the existence of God</a></h3>

<p>
Scotus&rsquo;s argument for the existence of God is rightly regarded
as one of the most outstanding contributions ever made to natural
theology. The argument is enormously complex, with several
sub-arguments for almost every important conclusion, and it can only
be sketched here. (Different versions of the proof are given at
<em>Lectura</em> 1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 38&ndash;135; <em>Ordinatio</em>
1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 39&ndash;190; <em>Reportatio</em> 1, d. 2, q. 1;
and <em>De primo principio</em>.)</p>

<p>
Scotus begins by arguing that there is a first agent (a being that is
first in efficient causality). Consider first the distinction between
essentially ordered causes and accidentally ordered causes. In an
accidentally ordered series, the fact that a given member of that
series is itself caused is accidental to that member&rsquo;s own
causal activity. For example, Grandpa A generates a son, Dad B, who in
turn generates a son of his own, Grandson C. B&rsquo;s generating C in
no way depends on A&mdash;A could be long dead by the time B starts
having children. The fact that B was caused by A is irrelevant to
B&rsquo;s own causal activity. That&rsquo;s how an accidentally
ordered series of causes works.</p>

<p>
In an essentially ordered series, by contrast, the causal activity of
later members of the series depends essentially on the causal activity
of earlier members. For example, my shoulders move my arms, which in
turn move my golf club. My arms are capable of moving the golf club
only because they are being moved by my shoulders.</p>

<p>
With that distinction in mind, we can examine Scotus&rsquo;s argument
for the existence of a first efficient cause:</p>

<p>
Scotus then goes on to argue that there is an ultimate goal of
activity (a being that is first in final causality), and a maximally
excellent being (a being that is first in what Scotus calls
&ldquo;pre-eminence&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Thus he has proved what he calls the &ldquo;triple primacy&rdquo;:
there is a being that is first in efficient causality, in final
causality, and in pre-eminence. Scotus next proves that the three
primacies are coextensive: that is, any being that is first in one of
these three ways will also be first in the other two ways. Scotus then
argues that a being enjoying the triple primacy is endowed with
intellect and will, and that any such being is infinite. Finally, he
argues that there can be only one such being.</p>

<h3><a id="DivInfDocUni">2.3 Divine infinity and the doctrine of univocity</a></h3>

<p>
In laying out Scotus&rsquo;s proof of the existence of God, we have
passed rather quickly over the claim that God is infinite. But the
divine infinity deserves more detailed treatment. As we have already
seen, the concept of &ldquo;infinite being&rdquo; has a privileged
role in Scotus&rsquo;s natural theology. As a first approximation, we
can say that divine infinity is for Scotus what divine simplicity is
for Aquinas. It&rsquo;s the central divine-attribute generator. But
there are some important differences between the role of simplicity in
Aquinas and the role of infinity in Scotus. The most important, I
think, is that in Aquinas simplicity acts as an ontological spoilsport
for theological semantics. Simplicity is in some sense the key thing
about God, metaphysically speaking, but it seriously complicates our
language about God. God is supposed to be a subsistent simple, but
because our language is all derived from creatures, which are all
either subsistent but complex or simple but non-subsistent, we
don&rsquo;t have any way to apply our language straightforwardly to
God. The divine nature systematically resists being captured in
language.</p>

<p>
For Scotus, though, infinity is not only what&rsquo;s ontologically
central about God; it&rsquo;s the key component of our best available
concept of God and a guarantor of the success of theological language.
That is, our best ontology, far from fighting with our theological
semantics, both supports and is supported by our theological
semantics. The doctrine of univocity rests in part on the claim that
&ldquo;[t]he difference between God and creatures, at least with
regard to God&rsquo;s possession of the pure perfections, is
ultimately one of degree&rdquo; (Cross [1999], 39). Remember one of
Scotus&rsquo;s arguments for univocity. If we are to follow Anselm in
ascribing to God every pure perfection, we have to affirm that we are
ascribing to God <em>the very same thing</em> that we ascribe to
creatures: God has it infinitely, creatures in a limited way. One
could hardly ask for a more harmonious cooperation between ontology
(what God is) and semantics (how we can think and talk about him).</p>

<p>
Scotus ascribes to Aquinas the following argument for the divine
infinity: If a form is limited by matter, it is finite. God, being
simple, is not limited by matter. Therefore, God is not finite. This,
as Scotus points out, is a fallacious argument. (It&rsquo;s an
instance of denying the antecedent.) But even apart from the fallacy,
simplicity is not going to get us infinity. As Scotus puts it:
&ldquo;if an entity is finite or infinite, it is so not by reason of
something accidental to itself, but because it has its own intrinsic
degree of finite or infinite perfection&rdquo; (<em>Ordinatio</em> 1,
d. 1, pars 1, q. 1&ndash;2, n. 142). So simplicity does not entail
infinity, because finitude is not the result of composition. To look
at it another way, Aquinas&rsquo;s conception of infinity is
<em>negative</em> and <em>relational</em>. The infinite is that which
is <em>not bounded by something else</em>. But Scotus thinks we can
have a positive conception of infinity, according to which infinity is
not a negative, relational property, but instead a positive, intrinsic
property. It is an &ldquo;intrinsic degree of perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
How do we acquire that conception of positive, intrinsic infinity? The
story goes like this. We begin with &ldquo;the potentially infinite in
quantity.&rdquo; According to Aristotle, you can never have an actual
quantitative infinity, since no matter how great a quantity you have,
you can always have more. What you can have (and in fact do have,
Aristotle thinks) is a quantitative infinity by successive parts. The
next step is to imagine that all the parts of that quantitative
infinity remained in existence simultaneously. That is, we imagine an
actual quantitative infinity. Scotus then asks us to shift from
thinking about an actual quantitative infinity to thinking about an
actual <em>qualitative</em> infinity. Think of some quality (say,
goodness) as existing infinitely: so that there is, as it were, no
more goodness that you could add to that goodness to make it any
greater. That&rsquo;s infinite goodness. But notice that you
can&rsquo;t think of infinite goodness as in some way composed of
little goodness-bits (just an infinite number of them). If one says
that an angel is better than a human being, one can&rsquo;t mean that
a human being has a certain number of goodness-bits while the angel
has that many plus some extras. Rather, the specific degree of
goodness of a thing is just an intrinsic, non-quantitative feature of
that thing. Infinite being is just like that. Scotus describes it as
&ldquo;a measure of intrinsic excellence that is not finite.&rdquo;
This is why the concept of &ldquo;infinite being&rdquo; is the
simplest concept available to us for understanding God. Infinity is
not some sort of accidental addition to being, but an intrinsic mode
of being. Of course, if this is right, then the concepts of
&lsquo;infinite goodness,&rsquo; &lsquo;infinite power,&rsquo; and so
forth, are every bit as simple as the concept of &lsquo;infinite
being.&rsquo; So why does Scotus make such a big deal about
&lsquo;infinite being&rsquo;? Because &lsquo;infinite being&rsquo;
&ldquo;virtually contains&rdquo; all the other infinite perfections of
God. That is, we can deduce the other infinite perfections from
infinite being. So besides being the next best thing to a simple
concept, it&rsquo;s the most theoretically fruitful concept we can
have of God in this life.</p>

<h2><a id="Met">3. Metaphysics</a></h2>

<h3><a id="SubMatMet">3.1 The subject matter of metaphysics</a></h3>

<p>
Metaphysics, according to Scotus, is a &ldquo;real theoretical
science&rdquo;: it is real in that it treats things rather than
concepts, theoretical in that it is pursued for its own sake rather
than as a guide for doing or making things, and a science in that it
proceeds from self-evident principles to conclusions that follow
deductively from them. The various real theoretical sciences are
distinguished by their subject matter, and Scotus devotes considerable
attention to determining what the distinctive subject matter of
metaphysics is. His conclusion is that metaphysics concerns
&ldquo;being <em>qua</em> being&rdquo; (<em>ens inquantum ens</em>).
That is, the metaphysician studies being simply as such, rather than
studying, say, material being as material.</p>

<p>
The study of being <em>qua</em> being includes, first of all, the
study of the transcendentals, so called because they transcend the
division of being into finite and infinite, and the further division
of finite being into the ten Aristotelian categories. Being itself is
a transcendental, and so are the &ldquo;proper attributes&rdquo; of
being&mdash;one, true, and good&mdash;which are coextensive with
being. Scotus also identifies an indefinite number of disjunctions
that are coextensive with being and therefore count as
transcendentals, such as infinite-or-finite and
necessary-or-contingent. Finally, all the pure perfections (see above)
are transcendentals, since they transcend the division of being into
finite and infinite. Unlike the proper attributes of being and the
disjunctive transcendentals, however, they are not coextensive with
being. For God is wise and Socrates is wise, but
earthworms&mdash;though they are certainly beings&mdash;are not
wise.</p>

<p>
The study of the Aristotelian categories also belongs to metaphysics
insofar as the categories, or the things falling under them, are
studied as beings. (If they are studied as concepts, they belong
instead to the logician.) There are exactly ten categories, Scotus
argues. The first and most important is the category of substance.
Substances are beings in the most robust sense, since they have an
independent existence: that is, they do not exist <em>in</em>
something else. Beings in any of the other nine categories, called
accidents, exist in substances. The nine categories of accidents are
quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, place, time, position,
and state (<em>habitus</em>).</p>

<h3><a id="MatForBodSou">3.2 Matter and form, body and soul</a></h3>

<p>
Now imagine some particular substance, say, me. Suppose I go from
being pale to being tan. Now it is still I who exist both before and
after the sun has had its characteristic effect on me. This
illustrates an important feature of substances: they can successively
have contrary accidents and yet retain their numerical identity. This
sort of change is known, appropriately enough, as accidental change.
In an accidental change, a substance persists through the change,
having first one accident and then another. But clearly not all
changes are accidental changes. There was once a time when I did not
exist, and then I came into existence. We can&rsquo;t analyze this
change as an accidental change, since there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
any substance that persists through the change. Instead, a substance
is precisely what comes into being; this is not an accidental but a
<em>substantial</em> change. And yet there must be something that
persists even through substantial change, since otherwise we
wouldn&rsquo;t have change at all; substances would come to exist from
nothing and disappear into nothing. Scotus follows Aristotle in
identifying <em>matter</em> as what persists through substantial
change and <em>substantial form</em> as what makes a given parcel of
matter the definite, unique, individual substance that it is. (There
are also accidental forms, which are a substance&rsquo;s accidental
qualities.)</p>

<p>
Thus far Scotus is simply repeating Aristotelian orthodoxy, and none
of his contemporaries or immediate predecessors would have found any
of this at all strange. But as Scotus elaborates his views on form and
matter, he espouses three important theses that mark him off from some
other philosophers of his day: he holds that matter can exist without
any form whatsoever, that not all created substances are composites of
form and matter, and that one and the same substance can have more
than one substantial form. Let us examine each of these theses in
turn.</p>

<p>
First, Scotus argues that God can create and conserve what was called
&ldquo;prime matter&rdquo;: that is, matter that has no form
whatsoever. (For an analysis of the arguments, see Ward 2014.) Matter
and form are distinct things, as the case of substantial change makes
clear: matter persists when forms come and go. Now that fact by itself
might be taken to show only that matter can exist apart from any
<em>given</em> form (and Scotus thinks that too), but Scotus takes the
separability of matter and form even further. Divine omnipotence means
that God can cause immediately (that is, without a secondary cause)
whatever he ordinarily causes through a secondary cause. God
ordinarily causes matter through form; but given divine omnipotence,
he need not. He can create matter without any form. Moreover, given
that matter is a thing distinct from form, God creates matter directly
and immediately; and what God creates immediately, he can conserve
immediately. So God can conserve matter without conserving any of the
forms that characterize that matter.</p>

<p>
Second, Scotus denies &ldquo;universal hylomorphism,&rdquo; the view
that all created substances are composites of form and matter
(<em>Lectura</em> 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55). Universal hylomorphism
(from the Greek <em>hyle</em>, meaning &lsquo;matter,&rsquo; and
<em>morphe</em>, meaning &lsquo;form&rsquo;) had been the predominant
view among Franciscans before Scotus. Saint Bonaventure, for example,
had argued that even angels could not be altogether immaterial; they
must be compounds of form and &ldquo;spiritual matter.&rdquo; For
matter is potentiality and form is actuality, so if the angels were
altogether immaterial, they would be pure actuality without any
admixture of potentiality. But only God is pure actuality. But as we
have already seen in his affirmation of the existence of prime matter,
Scotus simply denies the unqualified equation of matter with
potentiality and form with actuality. Prime matter, though entirely
without form, could be actual; and a purely immaterial being is not
automatically bereft of potentiality.</p>

<p>
Third, Scotus holds that some substances have more than one
substantial form (<em>Ordinatio</em> 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). This
doctrine of the plurality of substantial forms was commonly held among
the Franciscans but vigorously disputed by others. We can very easily
see the motivation for the view by recalling that a substantial form
is supposed to be what makes a given parcel of matter the definite,
unique, individual substance that it is. Now suppose, as many medieval
thinkers (including Aquinas) did, that the soul is the one and only
substantial form of the human being. It would then follow that when a
human being dies, and the soul ceases to inform that parcel of matter,
what is left is not the same body that existed just before death;
there is an entirely new substance, with entirely new accidents (for
accidents depend for their being on the substance in which they
inhere). For what made it that very body was its substantial form,
which (<em>ex hypothesi</em>) is no longer there.</p>

<p>
To Scotus and many of his fellow Franciscans it therefore seemed
obvious that we need to posit a plurality of substantial forms to
avoid these metaphysical incongruities. One standard form of such
pluralism postulated a &ldquo;form of the body&rdquo; (<em>forma
corporeitatis</em>) that makes a given parcel of matter to be a
definite, unique, individual organism, and the &ldquo;animating
form&rdquo; or soul, which makes that body alive. At death, the
animating soul ceases to vivify the body, but numerically the same
body remains, and the form of the body keeps the matter organized, at
least for a while. Since the form of the body is too weak on its own
to keep the body in existence indefinitely, however, the body
gradually decomposes.</p>

<p>
Scotus&rsquo;s view is more complicated still, for he treats each
organ of a living body as a substance (a composite of matter and
substantial form). Whether Scotus also acknowledges a <em>forma
corporeitatis</em> over and above the forms of the bodily organs is
disputed (see Ward 2014, 90&ndash;93). If he does not, he must accept
the unpalatable conclusion that a corpse is not the same body as the
body of the organism. He can, however, avoid the conclusion that no
accidents of that body remain: any accidents that inhere in the organs
can remain, because the organs are substances and continue to exist
(for a while, anyway) when the body of which they were parts ceases to
exist.</p>

<p>
Note that the general tendency of Scotus&rsquo;s theories of form and
matter is to allow a high degree of independence to form and matter.
In positing the existence of prime matter, Scotus envisions matter as
existing without any form; in denying universal hylomorphism, he
envisions form as existing without any matter. And the doctrine of the
plurality of substantial forms strongly suggests that the human soul
is an identifiable individual in its own right. So everything Scotus
says in this connection seems to make room for the
<em>possibility</em> that the soul survives the death of the body and
continues to exist as an immaterial substance in its own right. But
Scotus canvases a number of philosophical arguments for the claim that
this possibility is in fact realized, and he finds none of them
compelling. That the human soul survives the death of the body is
something we can know only through faith.</p>

<h3><a id="UniInd">3.3 Universals and individuation</a></h3>

<p>
The problem of universals may be thought of as the question of what,
if anything, is the metaphysical basis of our using the same predicate
for more than one distinct individual. Socrates is human and Plato is
human. Does this mean that there must be some one universal
reality&mdash;humanity&mdash;that is somehow <em>repeatable</em>, in
which Socrates and Plato both share? Or is there nothing
metaphysically common to them at all? Those who think there is some
actual universal existing outside the mind are called realists; those
who deny extra-mental universals are called nominalists. Scotus was a
realist about universals, and like all realists he had to give an
account of what exactly those universals are: what their status is,
what sort of existence they have outside the mind. So, in the case of
Socrates and Plato, the question is &ldquo;What sort of item is this
humanity that both Socrates and Plato exemplify?&rdquo; A related
question that realists have to face is the problem of individuation.
Given that there is some extra-mental reality common to Socrates and
Plato, we also need to know what it is in each of them that makes them
<em>distinct</em> exemplifications of that extra-mental reality.</p>

<p>
Scotus calls the extra-mental universal the &ldquo;common
nature&rdquo; (<em>natura communis</em>) and the principle of
individuation the &ldquo;haecceity&rdquo; (<em>haecceitas</em>). The
common nature is common in that it is &ldquo;indifferent&rdquo; to
existing in any number of individuals. But it has extra-mental
existence only <em>in</em> the particular things in which it exists,
and in them it is always &ldquo;contracted&rdquo; by the haecceity. So
the common nature <em>humanity</em> exists in both Socrates and Plato,
although in Socrates it is made individual by Socrates&rsquo;s
<em>haecceitas</em> and in Plato by Plato&rsquo;s <em>haecceitas</em>.
The humanity-of-Socrates is individual and non-repeatable, as is the
humanity-of-Plato; yet humanity itself is common and repeatable, and
it is ontologically prior to any particular exemplification of it
(<em>Ordinatio</em> 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1&ndash;6, translated in
Spade [1994], 57&ndash;113).</p>

<h2><a id="TheKno">4. Theory of Knowledge</a></h2>

<h3><a id="SenAbs">4.1 Sensation and abstraction</a></h3>

<p>
Scotus adopts the standard medieval Aristotelian view that human
beings, alone among the animals, have two different sorts of cognitive
powers: senses and intellect. The senses differ from the intellect in
that they have physical organs; the intellect is immaterial. In order
for the intellect to make use of sensory information, therefore, it
must somehow take the raw material provided by the senses in the form
of material images and make them into suitable objects for
understanding. This process is known as abstraction, from the Latin
<em>abstrahere</em>, which is literally &ldquo;to drag out.&rdquo; The
intellect pulls out the universal, as it were, from the material
singular in which it is embedded. This activity is performed by the
active or agent intellect, which takes the &ldquo;phantasms&rdquo;
derived from sense experience and turns them into &ldquo;intelligible
species.&rdquo; Those species are actualized in the possible or
receptive intellect, whose function is to receive and then store the
intelligible species provided by the active intellect. Scotus denies
that the active and passive intellect are really distinct. Rather,
there is one intellect that has these two distinct functions or
powers.</p>

<p>
Phantasms do not, however, become irrelevant once the intelligible
species has been abstracted. Scotus holds (just as Aquinas had held)
that the human intellect never understands anything without turning
towards phantasms (<em>Lectura</em> 2, d. 3, pars 2, q. 1, n. 255).
That is, in order to deploy a concept that has already been acquired,
one must make some use of sensory data&mdash;although the phantasms
employed in using a concept already acquired need not be anything like
the phantasms from which that concept was abstracted in the first
place. I acquired the intelligible species of dog from phantasms of
dogs, but I can make use of that concept now not only by calling up an
image of a dog but also by (say) imagining the sound of the Latin word
for dog. Scotus&rsquo;s point is simply that there must be some
sensory context for any act of intellectual cognition.</p>

<p>
And even that point is not quite as general as my unqualified
statement suggests. For one thing, Scotus believes that our
intellect&rsquo;s need for phantasms is a temporary state. It is only
in this present life that the intellect must turn to phantasms; in the
next life we will be able to do without them. For another thing,
Scotus argues in his later works that even in this life we enjoy a
kind of intellectual cognition that bypasses phantasms. He called it
&ldquo;intuitive cognition.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a id="IntCog">4.2 Intuitive cognition</a></h3>

<p>
Scotus understands intuitive cognition by way of contrast with
abstractive cognition. The latter, as we have seen, involves the
universal; and a universal as such need not be exemplified. That is,
my intelligible species of dog only tells me what it is to be a dog;
it doesn&rsquo;t tell me whether any particular dog actually exists.
Intuitive cognition, by contrast, &ldquo;yields information about how
things are right now&rdquo; (Pasnau [2002]). Sensory cognition, as
Scotus explicitly acknowledges, counts as intuitive cognition on this
account. It is, after all, quite uncontroversial that my seeing or
hearing a dog gives me information about some particular dog as it
exists when I see or hear it. Scotus&rsquo;s much bolder claim
concerns <em>intellectual</em> intuitive cognition, by which the
intellect cognizes a particular thing as existing at that very moment.
Intellectual intuitive cognition does not require phantasms; nor does
it involve intelligible species (which, like phantasms, are
abstractive).</p>

<p>
Intellectual intuitive cognition has two different kinds of objects:
extramental sensible objects and the soul&rsquo;s own acts. (Scotus
comes around to affirming the possibility of such cognition of
extramental objects in his later works, having denied it earlier in
his career; he is consistent about the possibility of intuitive
cognition of the soul&rsquo;s acts. See Cross 2014, 43&ndash;64, which
informs this section.) We must have intuitive cognition of extramental
objects because we can cognize them intellectually <em>as
existing</em>; we can form propositions about them and use such
propositions in syllogisms. So, for example, if I form the proposition
&ldquo;This flower is red,&rdquo; the contents of that proposition
must be in the intellect, not merely in the sense. This is
<em>intellectual</em> cognition because it is conceptual; it is
<em>intuitive</em> cognition because it concerns something <em>as
existing</em>. The information contained in the sensible
species&mdash;the shape and color of the flower&mdash;is
&ldquo;promoted&rdquo; by the agent intellect from material existence
in an organ to immaterial existence in the non-organic intellect, so
that it is available for intellectual cognition. The role of sensible
species in intuitive intellectual cognition explains why Scotus denies
that we can have such cognition of non-sensible objects, such as
angels, in this life.</p>

<p>
We also have intuitive cognition of our mental acts. (As discussed in
the next section, Scotus attaches considerable importance to our
intuitive self-knowledge). Abstractive cognition could provide me with
an abstract concept of <em>thinking about Scotus</em>, for example,
but I need intuitive cognition to know that I am in fact exemplifying
that concept right this minute. This kind of intuitive cognition
clearly dispenses even with sensible species, since the
intellect&rsquo;s acts, like the intellect itself, are immaterial and
therefore not the sorts of things that can be sensed.</p>

<h3><a id="AttSkeIll">4.3 The attack on skepticism and illuminationism</a></h3>

<p>
Scotus argues that the human intellect is capable of achieving
certainty in its knowledge of the truth simply by the exercise of its
own natural powers, with no special divine help. He therefore opposes
both skepticism, which denies the possibility of certain knowledge,
and illuminationism, which insists that we need special divine
illumination in order to attain certainty. He works out his attack on
both doctrines in the course of a reply to Henry of Ghent in
<em>Ordinatio</em> 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 4. (For a translation, see van
den Bercken [2016], 114&ndash;143.)</p>

<p>
According to Henry, truth involves a relation to an
&ldquo;exemplar.&rdquo; (We can think of this relation as akin to the
relation of correspondence appealed to by certain theories of truth,
and the exemplar itself as the mental item that is one of the relata
of the correspondence-relation. The other relatum, of course, is
&ldquo;the way things really are.&rdquo;) Now there are two exemplars:
the created exemplar, which is the species of the universal caused by
the thing known, and the uncreated exemplar, which is an idea in the
divine mind. Henry argues that the created exemplar cannot provide us
with certain and infallible knowledge of a thing. For, first, the
object from which the exemplar is abstracted is itself mutable and
therefore cannot be the cause of something immutable. And how can
there be certain knowledge apart from some immutable basis for that
knowledge? Second, the soul itself is mutable and subject to error,
and it can be preserved from error only by something less mutable than
itself. But the created exemplar is even more mutable than the soul.
Third, the created exemplar by itself does not allow us to distinguish
between reality and dreaming, since the content of the exemplar is the
same in either case. Henry therefore concludes that if we are to have
certainty, we must look to the uncreated exemplar. And since we cannot
look to the uncreated exemplar by our natural powers, certainty is
impossible apart from some special divine illumination.</p>

<p>
Scotus argues that if Henry is right about the limitations of our
natural powers, even divine illumination is not enough to save us from
pervasive uncertainty. To Henry&rsquo;s first argument he replies that
there is no certainty to be had by knowing a mutable object as
immutable. To the second he replies that anything in the
soul&mdash;including the very act of understanding that Henry thinks
is achieved through illumination&mdash;is mutable. So by Henry&rsquo;s
argument it would be impossible for anything whatever to preserve the
soul from error. And to the third argument he replies that if the
created exemplar is such as to preclude certainty, adding extra
exemplars will not solve the problem: &ldquo;When something
incompatible with certainty concurs, certainty cannot be
attained&rdquo; (<em>Ordinatio</em> 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 4, n.
221).</p>

<p>
So Henry&rsquo;s arguments, far from showing that certainty is
possible through divine illumination, actually lead to a pervasive
skepticism. Scotus counters that we can show that skepticism is false.
We can in fact attain certainty, and we can do so by the unaided
exercise of our natural intellectual powers. There are four types of
knowledge in which infallible certainty is possible. First, knowledge
of first principles is certain because the intellect has only to form
such judgments to see that they are true. (And since the validity of
proper syllogistic inference can be known in just this way, it follows
that anything that is seen to be properly derived from first
principles by syllogistic inference is also known with certainty.)
Second, we have certainty with respect to quite a lot of causal
judgments derived from experience. Third, Scotus says that many of our
own acts are as certain as first principles. It is no objection to
point out that our acts are contingent, since some contingent
propositions must be known immediately (that is, without needing to be
derived from some other proposition). For otherwise, either some
contingent proposition would follow from a necessary proposition
(which is impossible), or there would be an infinite regress in
contingent propositions (in which case no contingent proposition would
ever be known). Fourth, certain propositions about present sense
experience are also known with certainty if they are properly vetted
by the intellect in light of the causal judgments derived from
experience.</p>

<h2><a id="EthMorPsy">5. Ethics and Moral Psychology</a></h2>

<h3><a id="NatLaw">5.1 The natural law</a></h3>

<p>
For Scotus the natural law in the strict sense contains only those
moral propositions that are <em>per se notae ex terminis</em> along
with whatever propositions can be derived from them deductively
(<em>Ordinatio</em> 3, d. 37, q. un.). <em>Per se notae</em> means
that they are self-evident; <em>ex terminis</em> adds that they are
self-evident in virtue of being analytically true. Now one important
fact about propositions that are self-evident and analytically true is
that God himself can&rsquo;t make them false. They are necessary
truths. So the natural law in the strict sense does not depend on
God&rsquo;s will. This means that even if it is supposed that Scotus
is some sort of divine-command theorist, he is not whole-hog in his
divine command theory. Some moral truths are necessary truths, and
even God can&rsquo;t change those. They would be true no matter what
God willed.</p>

<p>
Which ones are those? Scotus&rsquo;s basic answer is that they are the
commandments of the first tablet of the Decalogue (Ten Commandments).
The Decalogue has often been thought of as involving two tablets. The
first covers our obligations to God and consists of the first three
commandments: <em>You shall have no other gods before me</em>, <em>You
shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain</em>, and
<em>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy</em>. (Note that many
Protestants divide them up differently.) The second tablet spells out
our obligations toward others: <em>Honor your father and mother</em>,
<em>You shall not kill</em>, <em>You shall not commit adultery</em>,
<em>You shall not steal</em>, <em>You shall not bear false witness
against your neighbor</em>, and two commandments against coveting. The
commandments of the first tablet are part of the natural law in the
strict sense because they have to do with God himself, and with the
way in which God is to be treated. For Scotus says that the following
proposition is <em>per se nota ex terminis</em>: &ldquo;If God exists,
then he is to be loved as God, and nothing else is to be worshiped as
God, and no irreverence is to be done to him.&rdquo; Given the very
definition of God, it follows that if there is such a being, he is to
be loved and worshiped, and no irreverence should be shown to him.
Because these commandments are self-evident and analytic, they are
necessary truths. Not even God himself could make them false.</p>

<p>
But even the first three commandments, once we start looking at them,
are not obviously part of the natural law in the strict sense. In
particular, the third commandment, the one about the Sabbath day, is a
little tricky. Obviously, the proposition &ldquo;God is to be
worshiped on Saturday&rdquo; is not self-evident or analytic. In fact,
Scotus says it&rsquo;s not even true any more, since Christians are to
worship on Sunday, not Saturday. So, Scotus asks, what about the
proposition &ldquo;God is to be worshiped at some time or
other&rdquo;? Even that is not self-evident or analytic. The best one
can do is &ldquo;God is not to be hated.&rdquo; Now that&rsquo;s
self-evident and analytic, since by definition God is the being most
worthy of love and there is nothing in him worthy of hate. But
obviously that&rsquo;s far weaker than any positive commandment about
whether and when we should worship God.</p>

<p>
So by the time Scotus completes his analysis, we are left with nothing
in the natural law in the strict sense except for negative
propositions: God is not to be hated, no other gods are to be
worshiped, no irreverence is to be done to God. Everything else in the
Decalogue belongs to the natural law in a weaker or looser sense.
These are propositions that are not <em>per se notae ex terminis</em>
and do not follow from such propositions, but are &ldquo;highly
consonant&rdquo; with such propositions. Now the important point for
Scotus is this: since these propositions are contingent, they are
completely up to God&rsquo;s discretion. Any contingent truth
whatsoever depends on God&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p>
According to Scotus, God of course is aware of all contingent
propositions. Now God gets to assign the truth values to those
propositions. For example, &ldquo;Unicorns exist&rdquo; is a
contingent proposition. Therefore, it is up to God&rsquo;s will
whether that proposition will be true or false. The same goes for
contingent moral propositions. Take any such proposition and call it
<em>L</em>, and call the opposite of <em>L</em>, not-<em>L</em>. Both
<em>L</em> and not-<em>L</em> are contingent propositions. God can
make either of them true, but he can&rsquo;t make both of them true,
since they are contradictories. Suppose that God wills <em>L</em>.
<em>L</em> is now part of the moral law. How do we explain why God
willed <em>L</em> rather than not-<em>L</em>? Scotus says we
can&rsquo;t. God&rsquo;s will with respect to contingent propositions
is unqualifiedly free. So while there might be some reasons why God
chose the laws he chose, there is no fully adequate reason, no total
explanation. If there were a total explanation other than God&rsquo;s
will itself, those propositions wouldn&rsquo;t be contingent at all.
They would be necessary. So at bottom there is simply the sheer fact
that God willed one law rather than another.</p>

<p>
Scotus intends this claim to be exactly parallel to the way we think
about contingent beings. Why are there elephants but no unicorns? As
everyone would agree, it&rsquo;s because God willed for there to be
elephants but no unicorns. And why did he will that? He just did.
That&rsquo;s part of what we mean by saying that God was free in
creating. There was nothing constraining him or forcing him to create
one thing rather than another. The same is true about the moral law.
Why is there an obligation to honor one&rsquo;s parents but no such
obligation toward cousins? Because God willed that there be an
obligation to honor one&rsquo;s parents, and he did not will that
there be any such obligation toward one&rsquo;s cousins. He could have
willed both of these obligations, and he could have willed neither.
What explains the way that he did in fact will? Nothing whatsoever
except the sheer fact that he did will that way.</p>

<p>
(For recent criticisms of this strongly voluntaristic reading of
Scotus&rsquo;s account of the moral law, see Borland and Hillman 2017
and Ward 2019.)</p>

<h3><a id="WilFreMor">5.2 The will, freedom, and morality</a></h3>

<p>
Scotus quite self-consciously puts forward his understanding of
freedom as an alternative to Aquinas&rsquo;s. According to Aquinas,
freedom comes in simply because the will is intellectual appetite
rather than mere sense appetite. Intellectual appetite is aimed at
objects as presented by the intellect and sense appetite at objects as
presented by the senses. Sense appetite is not free because the senses
provide only particulars as objects of appetite. But intellectual
appetite is free because the intellect deals with universals, not
particulars. Since universals by definition include many particulars,
intellectual appetite will have a variety of objects. Consider
goodness as an example. The will is not aimed at this good thing or
that good thing, but at goodness in general. Since that universal,
goodness, contains many different particular things, intellectual
appetite has many different options.</p>

<p>
But Scotus insists that mere intellectual appetite is not enough to
guarantee freedom in the sense needed for morality. The basic
difference comes down to this. When Aquinas argues that intellectual
appetite has different options, he seems to be thinking of this over a
span of time. Right now the intellect presents <em>x</em> as good, so
I will <em>x</em>; but later on the intellect presents <em>y</em> as
good, so then I will <em>y</em>. But Scotus thinks of freedom as
involving multiple options at the very moment of choice. It&rsquo;s
not enough to say that now I will <em>x</em>, but later I can will
<em>y</em>. We have to say that at the very moment at which I will
<em>x</em>, I also am able to will <em>y</em>. Aquinas&rsquo;s
arguments don&rsquo;t show that intellectual appetite is free in this
stronger sense. So as far as Scotus is concerned, Aquinas hasn&rsquo;t
made room for the right kind of freedom.</p>

<p>
These considerations illustrate two claims that Scotus makes
consistently throughout his career. First, synchronic contingency is
necessary for freedom. (See Dumont 1995 and MacDonald 1995 for an
account of Scotus&rsquo;s understanding of synchronic contingency and
its historical background.) That is, for a volition to be free, the
agent must, at the very moment of willing, have the power to will
otherwise. Second, freedom is ultimately rooted in the will, not in
the intellect. Aquinas had held that freedom is in the will as subject
but in reason as cause: that is, the will is <em>what</em> is free but
reason is <em>why</em> it&rsquo;s free. For Scotus the will is free in
its own right. These two claims are closely connected. &ldquo;The will
can be drawn freely to different things,&rdquo; Aquinas had written,
&ldquo;in virtue of the fact that reason can have diverse conceptions
of the good&rdquo; (<em>ST</em> I-II.17.1 ad 2)&mdash;not, of course,
synchronically, but diachronically. Scotus insists that the will does
not depend on the intellect for its freedom. Freedom is not a
byproduct of our power of thought and deliberation; it does not rest
on the possibility that we can, over time, revise our thoughts about
what is good. Freedom is intrinsic to the will itself, and in any
moment of free choice the will can either accept or disregard the
intellect&rsquo;s judgment.</p>

<p>
Where Scotus is not so consistent is in his use of Anselm&rsquo;s
theory of the two affections of the will. Anselm had used the two
affections to explain free choice, and in particular the primal
angelic choice. The angels had both an affection for
advantage&mdash;the motivation to chose whatever they thought would
constitute or contribute to their happiness&mdash;and an affection for
justice&mdash;the motivation to choose what is just, and to choose it
for its own sake. Which of the two motivations they acted on was up to
the angels themselves. (See
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anselm/#FreSin">Anselm: Freedom and Sin</a>.)
 Although the two affections show up in various places in
Scotus&rsquo;s <em>Sentences</em> commentaries&mdash;and once in the
<em>Notabilia Scoti</em>&mdash;his most extensive discussion always
comes (not surprisingly) in Book II, d. 6, q. 2, where he investigates
the fall of the angels. We have three versions of Scotus&rsquo;s
treatment of this question: first in the <em>Lectura</em>, then in the
<em>Ordinatio</em>, and finally in the <em>Reportatio</em>. Scotus
became progressively less Anselmian with each iteration (see King
2010), and even the <em>Lectura</em> version is not wholeheartedly
Anselmian, since Scotus identifies the angels&rsquo; primal
sins&mdash;first excessive self-love, then an inordinate willing of
happiness for themselves, and then, finally, rejection of
God&mdash;without any appeal to the two affections. By the time we get
to the <em>Reportatio</em>, nothing is left of Anselm&rsquo;s two
affections but the names: &ldquo;the affection for the advantageous
and the affection for justice are not distinct from the will, as if
they were something added over and above it&rdquo; (<em>Rep</em>. II
d. 6 q. 2 n. 26; thanks to Garrett Smith for providing a critically
edited text, a translation of which is linked into the Other Internet
Resources section). When we speak of the affection for the
advantageous, we are simply speaking of the will as intellectual
appetite; when we speak of the affection for justice, we are simply
speaking of the will as free.</p>
