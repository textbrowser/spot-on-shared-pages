<h1>Laozi</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Dec 15, 2001; substantive revision Wed Oct 22, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Daoism (also romanized as Taoism)&nbsp;generally names one of the
three main currents of traditional Chinese thought, although it should
be obvious that like any &ldquo;ism,&rdquo; it is an
abstraction&mdash;what it&nbsp;names is&nbsp;not a uniform but
multifaceted tradition&nbsp;with rich internal differences.
Specifically, &ldquo;Daoism&rdquo; encompasses both a philosophical
tradition and an organized religion, which in modern Chinese are
identified separately as <em>daojia</em>&nbsp;and <em>daojiao</em>,
respectively. The two are deeply intertwined, and Laozi (or Lao-tzu)
figures centrally in both.</p>

<p>
Philosophical Daoism traces its origins to Laozi, an extraordinary
thinker who flourished during the sixth century B.C.E., according to
Chinese sources. According to some modern scholars, however, Laozi is
entirely legendary; there was never a historical Laozi. In religious
Daoism, Laozi is revered as a supreme deity.</p>

<p>
The name &ldquo;Laozi&rdquo; is best taken to mean &ldquo;Old
(<em>lao</em>) Master (<em>zi</em>),&rdquo; and Laozi the ancient
philosopher is said to have written a short book, which has come to be
called simply the <em>Laozi</em>, after its putative author, a common
practice in early China.</p>

<p>
When the <em>Laozi</em> was recognized as a &ldquo;classic&rdquo;
(<em>jing</em>)&mdash;that is, accorded canonical status in the
classification of Chinese literature, on account of its profound
insight and significance&mdash;it acquired a more exalted and
hermeneutically instructive title, <em>Daodejing</em>
(or&nbsp;<em>Tao-te ching</em>), commonly translated as the
&ldquo;Classic of the Way and Virtue.&rdquo; Its influence on Chinese
culture is pervasive, and it reaches beyond China. It is concerned
with the Dao or &ldquo;Way&rdquo; and how it finds expression in
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo; (<em>de</em>), especially through what the text
calls &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; (<em>ziran</em>) and
&ldquo;nonaction&rdquo; (<em>wuwei</em>). These concepts, however, are
open to interpretation. While some interpreters see them as evidence
that the <em>Laozi</em> is a deeply spiritual work, others emphasize
their contribution to ethics and&nbsp;political philosophy.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="LaoSto">1. The Laozi Story</h2>

<p>
The <em>Shiji</em> (Records of the Historian) by the Han dynasty (206
B.C.E.&ndash;220 C.E.) court scribe and historian Sima Qian (ca.
145&ndash;86 B.C.E.) offers a &ldquo;biography&rdquo; of Laozi. Its
reliability has been questioned, but it provides a point of departure
for reconstructing the Laozi story.</p>

<p>
Laozi was a native of Chu, according to the <em>Shiji</em>, a southern
state in the Zhou dynasty (see Loewe and Shaughnessy 1999, 594 and
597). His family name&nbsp;was Li; his given name was Er, and he was
also called Dan.</p>

<p>
Laozi served as a keeper of archival records at the court of Zhou.
Confucius (551&ndash;479 B.C.E.) had consulted him on certain ritual
matters, we are told, and praised him lavishly afterward
(<em>Shiji</em> 63). This establishes the traditional claim that Laozi
was a senior contemporary of Confucius. A meeting, or meetings,
between Confucius and Laozi, identified as &ldquo;Lao Dan,&rdquo; is
reported also in the <em>Zhuangzi</em> and other early Chinese
sources.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laozi cultivated Dao and virtue,&rdquo; as Sima Qian goes on to
relate, and &ldquo;his learning was devoted to self-effacement and not
having fame. He lived in Zhou for a long time; witnessing the decline
of Zhou, he departed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
When he reached the northwest border then separating China from the
outside world, he met Yin Xi, the official in charge of the border
crossing, who asked him to put his teachings into writing. The result
was a book consisting of some five thousand Chinese characters or
graphs, divided into two parts, which discusses &ldquo;the meaning of
Dao and virtue.&rdquo; Thereafter, Laozi left; no one knew where he
had gone. This completes the main part of Sima Qian&rsquo;s account.
The remainder puts on record attempts to identify the legendary Laozi
with certain known historical individuals and concludes with a list of
Laozi&rsquo;s purported descendants (see W. T. Chan 1963, Lau 1963, or
Henricks 2000 for an English translation).</p>

<p>
Few scholars outside China today would subscribe fully to the
<em>Shiji</em> report. Disagreements abound, including, for example,
Laozi&rsquo;s birthplace and&nbsp;the name Laozi itself. On the
latter, although most would accept&nbsp;&ldquo;Laozi&rdquo; to mean
&ldquo;Old Master,&rdquo; a title of respect, some scholars believe
that &ldquo;Lao&rdquo; is a surname. On this view, just as Confucius
was referred to as &ldquo;Kong zi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Master Kong,&rdquo;
after his family name,&nbsp;&ldquo;Lao zi&rdquo;&nbsp;should be read
as &ldquo;Master Lao.&rdquo;&nbsp;The <em>Zhuangzi</em> and other
early texts refer to &ldquo;Lao Dan&rdquo; consistently, but not
&ldquo;Li Er.&rdquo; The name &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; is generally
understood to depict the bearer&rsquo;s &ldquo;long ears,&rdquo; a
mark of longevity in Chinese physiognomy. According to Fung Yu-lan,
Sima Qian had &ldquo;confused&rdquo; the legendary Lao Dan with Li Er,
who flourished later during the &ldquo;Warring States&rdquo; period
(480&ndash;221 B.C.E.) and was the &ldquo;real&rdquo; founder of the
&ldquo;Daoist school&rdquo; (<em>daojia</em>)&nbsp;(1983, 171).</p>

<p>
In an influential essay, A. C. Graham (1986) argues that the story of
Laozi reflects a conflation of different legends. The earliest strand
revolved around the meeting of Confucius with Lao Dan and was current
by the fourth century B.C.E. Subsequently, Lao Dan was recognized as a
great thinker in his own right and as the founder of a distinct
&ldquo;Laoist&rdquo; school of thought. It was not until the Han
dynasty, when the teachings of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and others were seen
to share certain insights centering on the concept of Dao, that they
were classified together under the rubric of a distinct Daoist school
of thought.</p>

<p>
I cite these views here only to give a sense of the diversity and
volume of research on the Laozi story. It seems clear that by 100
B.C.E. if not earlier, Laozi was already shrouded in legends and Sima
Qian could only exercise his judgment as a&nbsp;historian to put
together a report that made sense to him, based on the different and
sometimes competing sources at his disposal.</p>

<p>
The fact that Laozi appears favorably in both Confucian and Daoist
sources argues against the likelihood that the figure was fabricated
for polemical purposes. It is conceivable that a philosopher known as
Lao Dan attracted a following based on his novel reading of the Way
and virtue. Deferentially, his followers would refer to him as
&ldquo;Laozi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Confucius had sought his advice presumably on mourning and funeral
rites, given that the Confucian work <em>Liji</em> (Records of Rites)
has Confucius citing Lao Dan four times specifically on these rites.
Indeed, various dates have been proposed for the encounter&mdash;e.g.,
501 B.C.E., following the account in the <em>Zhuangzi</em> (ch. 14).
In any case, testifying to its appeal, different accounts of the
meeting circulated among the educated elite during the Warring States
period. Other details then came to be associated with Lao Dan, which
formed the basis of Sima Qian&rsquo;s reconstruction.</p>

<p>
Admittedly, this is conjecture. Though I find little reason not to
accept the traditional claim that Laozi was a senior contemporary of
Confucius, the identity of the &ldquo;Old Master&rdquo; no doubt will
continue to attract and divide scholarly opinion. In many popular
accounts, Laozi is described as the &ldquo;founder&rdquo; or
&ldquo;father&rdquo; of &ldquo;Daoism.&rdquo; This begs a number of
questions and therefore should not be taken uncritically, and this is
the reason why a discussion of the <em>Shiji</em> Laozi story is
offered here.</p>

<p>
The story of Laozi occupies a cherished place in the Daoist tradition.
It is important also because it raises certain hermeneutic
expectations and affects the way in which the <em>Laozi</em> is read.
If the work was written by a single author, one might expect, for
example, a high degree of consistency in style and content. If the
<em>Laozi</em> was a work of the sixth or fifth century B.C.E., one
might interpret certain sayings in the light of what we know of the
period. There is little consensus among scholars, however, on the date
or authorship of the <em>Laozi</em>, as we shall see below.</p>

<p>
With the arrival of the &ldquo;Way of the Celestial Masters&rdquo;
(<em>tianshidao</em>), the first organized religious Daoist
establishment in the second century C.E., the story of Laozi gained an
important hagiographic dimension.</p>

<p>
The founding of &ldquo;Celestial Master&rdquo; or &ldquo;Heavenly
Master&rdquo; Daoism was based on a new revelation of the Dao by Laozi
(see Kohn 1998a and 1998b, Kleeman 2016, and the entry on
 <a href="../daoism-religion/">Religious Daoism</a>&nbsp;in
 this <em>Encyclopedia</em>). In the eyes of the faithful, the Dao is
a divine reality, and Laozi is seen as the personification of the Dao.
Lao Dan is but one manifestation of the divine Laozi, albeit a pivotal
one because of the writing of the <em>Daodejing</em>, which in
religious Daoism commands devotion as a foundational scripture that
promises not only wisdom but also immortality and salvation to those
who submit to its power. During the Tang dynasty (618&ndash;907 C.E.),
the imperial Li family traced its ancestry to Laozi. Today,
Laozi&rsquo;s &ldquo;birthday&rdquo; is celebrated in many parts of
Asia on the fifteenth day of the second lunar month.</p>

<p>
The influence of the <em>Laozi</em> on Chinese culture is both deep
and far-reaching. One indication of its enduring appeal and
hermeneutical openness is the large number of commentaries devoted to
it throughout Chinese history&mdash;some seven hundred, according to
one count (W. T. Chan 1963, 77). Indeed, according to the Yuan-dynasty
Daoist master Zhang Yucai (d. 1316 C.E.), the number had exceeded
three thousand by his time (Wang Zhongmin 1981, 203).&nbsp;The
<em>Laozi</em> has inspired an intellectual movement known as
<em>Xuanxue</em>, &ldquo;Learning in the Profound&rdquo;&mdash;or
&ldquo;Neo-Daoism,&rdquo; as some commentators&nbsp;prefer,
emphasizing its roots in classical Daoism&mdash;that dominated the
Chinese elite or high culture from the third to the sixth century C.E.
(see the entry on
 <a href="../neo-daoism/">Neo-Daoism</a>).
 The <em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;also played a significant role in informing
the development of Chinese literature, calligraphy, painting, music,
martial arts, and other cultural traditions.</p>

<p>
Imperial patronage enhanced the prestige of the <em>Laozi</em> and
enlarged its scope of influence. In 733 C.E., the emperor Xuanzong
decreed that all officials should keep a copy of the
<em>Daodejing</em> at home and placed the classic on the list of texts
to be examined for the civil service examinations (see, e.g., the
report in the official Tang history, <em>Jiu Tang shu</em> 8). In
religious Daoism, recitation of the <em>Daodejing</em> is a prescribed
devotional practice and features centrally in ritual performance. The
<em>Daodejing</em> has been set to music from an early time. The term
&ldquo;<em>Laozi</em> learning&rdquo; (<em>Laoxue</em>) has come to
designate an important field of study. A useful work in Chinese that
sketches the major landmarks in this development is <em>Zhongguo
Laoxue shi</em> (A History of <em>Laozi</em> Learning in China) (Xiong
Tieji, et al. 1995); a follow-up effort focusing on <em>Laozi</em>
scholarship in the twentieth century by the same lead author was
published in 2002.</p>

<p>
The influence of the <em>Laozi</em> extends beyond mainland China. In
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and among the Chinese in Southeast Asia and beyond,
Daoism is a living tradition. Daoist beliefs and practices have
contributed also to the formation of Korean and Japanese culture,
although the process of cultural transmission, assimilation, and
transformation is complex, especially given the close interaction
among Daoism, Buddhism, and indigenous traditions such as Shint&#333;
(see Fukui, et al. 1983, vol. 3).</p>

<p>
During the seventh century, the <em>Laozi</em> was translated into
Sanskrit; in the eighteenth century a Latin translation was brought to
England, after which there has been a steady supply of translations
into different&nbsp;languages, yielding a bountiful&nbsp;harvest of
over 2,000, according to Misha Tadd (2022), with new ones still
hitting bookstores and internet sites almost every year. Some of the
more notable recent translations in English are Roberts 2001, Ivanhoe
2002, Ames and Hall 2003, Moeller 2007, Ryden and Penny 2008, Kim
2012, Minford 2018, Fischer 2023, Ziporyn 2023, and Liu 2024.
Tadd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Global Laozegetics&rdquo;&nbsp;project seeks to
provide a comprehensive record
of&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;translations, commentaries and
interpretations (2022).</p>

<p>
Laozi is an &ldquo;axial&rdquo; philosopher whose insight helps shape
the course of human development, according to Karl Jaspers (1974). The
influence of the <em>Laozi</em> on Western thinkers is the subject of
Clarke 2000. Memorable phrases from the <em>Laozi</em> such as
&ldquo;governing a large country is like cooking a small fish&rdquo;
(ch. 60) have found their way into global political rhetoric. At the
popular level, several illustrated or &ldquo;comic&rdquo; versions of
the <em>Laozi</em> reach out to a younger and wider readership (e.g.,
Tsai Chih Chung, et al. 1995, now available also on YouTube). Some may
have come to learn about the <em>Laozi</em> through such best-selling
works as <em>The Tao of Physics</em> (Capra 1975) or <em>The Tao of
Pooh</em> (Hoff 1982); and there is also <em>A Taoist Cookbook</em>
(Saso 1994), which comes with &ldquo;meditations&rdquo; from the
<em>Daodejing</em>. From nature lovers to management gurus, a growing
audience is discovering that the <em>Laozi</em> has something to offer
to them. The modern reception of the <em>Laozi</em> falls outside the
scope of this discussion; nevertheless, it is important to note that
the <em>Laozi</em> should be regarded not only as a work of early
Chinese philosophy, but also in a larger context as a classic of world
literature with keen contemporary relevance.</p>

<p>
The next three sections are intended for readers who are interested in
the textual history and commentarial tradition of the <em>Laozi</em>,
including the major manuscripts recovered through archaeological
excavations or from the antiquities market. They are important to
understanding the <em>Laozi</em>, but one may go directly to Section 5
on the main interpretive approaches to the text if one wishes to
bypass them.</p>

<h2 id="DatAutLao">2. Date and Authorship of the <em>Laozi</em></h2>

<p>
The date of composition refers to the time when the <em>Laozi</em>
reached more or less its final form; it does not rule out later
interpolations or textual corruptions.</p>

<p>
The traditional view, of course, is that the <em>Laozi</em> was
written by Lao Dan in the sixth or early fifth century B.C.E. This
seems unlikely, however, if it is assumed that the <em>Laozi</em> was
written by a single author. As the archaeological evidence to be
presented below will indicate, bodies of sayings attributed to Laozi
were committed to writing probably from the second half of the fifth
century B.C.E., resulting in different collections with overlapping
contents. A process of oral transmission may have preceded their
apperance, but in any event, these collections grew, competed for
attention, and gradually came to be consolidated during the fourth
century B.C.E. By the middle of the third century B.C.E., the
<em>Laozi</em> probably had reached a relatively stable form.</p>

<p>
Although in this sense the <em>Laozi</em> may be regarded as a
composite work, an &ldquo;anthology,&rdquo;&nbsp;as D.C. Lau suggests
(1963, 14),&nbsp;the product of many hands over a long period of time,
it should not be assumed that the sayings that now inhabit the
<em>Laozi</em> were put together at random. More likely, the final
product reflects a process of intellectual distillation on the part of
the compilers, who arranged and/or altered the material at their
disposal (see also Brooks and Brooks 1998, Hansen 1992, LaFargue 1992
and Mair 1990 on the composition of the <em>Laozi</em>).</p>

<p>
The language of the <em>Laozi</em> provides some clues to its date of
composition. Much of the text is rhymed. Focusing on rhyme patterns,
Liu Xiaogan (1994 and 1997) concludes that the poetic structure of the
<em>Laozi</em> is closer to that of the <em>Shijing</em> (Classic of
Poetry) than that of the later <em>Chuci</em> (Songs of Chu).</p>

<p>
The dating of the <em>Shijing</em> and the <em>Chuci</em> is by no
means precise, although generally the poems collected in the former
should not be later than the early fifth century B.C.E., whereas those
collected in the latter can be traced to no earlier than the middle of
the Warring States period, around 300 B.C.E. For this reason, Liu
Xiaogan argues that&nbsp;the traditional view first articulated by
Sima Qian should be upheld. Examining a wider range of linguistic
evidence, William Baxter agrees that the <em>Laozi</em> should be
dated earlier than the <em>Zhuangzi</em> and the <em>Chuci</em>, but
he traces &ldquo;the bulk of the <em>Lao-tzu</em> to the mid or early
fourth century&rdquo; (1998, 249). Both Liu and Baxter provide a
concise analysis of the different theories of the date of the
<em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
Why is this important? It may be argued that date and authorship are
immaterial to, and may detract from, interpretation. The
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; of the <em>Laozi</em> is &ldquo;timeless,&rdquo;
according to this view, transcending historical and cultural
specificities. Issues of provenance are important, however, if context
has any role to play in the production of meaning.</p>

<p>
Polemics among different schools of thought, for example, were far
more pronounced during the Warring States period than in the earlier
&ldquo;Spring and Autumn&rdquo; period (770&ndash;481 B.C.E.). (There
are different ways to date the Spring and Autumn and Warring States
periods, but they do not affect the discussion here.) The Zhou
government had been in decline; warfare among the vassal states
intensified both in scale and frequency from the fourth century B.C.E.
onward. As the political conditions deteriorated, philosophers and
strategists, who grew both in number and popularity as a social group
or profession during this time, vied to convince the rulers of the
various states of their vision&nbsp;to bring order to the land. At the
same time, perhaps with the increased displacement and disillusionment
of the privileged elite, a stronger eremitic tradition also emerged.
If the bulk of the <em>Laozi</em> had originated from the fourth
century, it might reflect some of these concerns. From this
perspective, the origin&nbsp;of the <em>Laozi</em> is as much a
hermeneutical issue as it is a historical one.</p>

<h2 id="TexTra">3. Textual Traditions</h2>

<p>
The discovery of two <em>Laozi</em> silk manuscripts at Mawangdui,
near the city of Changsha, Hunan province in 1973 marks an important
milestone in modern <em>Laozi</em> research. The manuscripts,
identified simply as &ldquo;A&rdquo; (<em>jia</em>) and
&ldquo;B&rdquo; (<em>yi</em>), were found in a tomb that was sealed in
168 B.C.E. The texts themselves can be dated earlier, the
&ldquo;A&rdquo; manuscript being the older of the two, copied in all
likelihood before 195 B.C.E. (see Lau 1982, Boltz 1984, and Henricks
1989). A documentary on the Mawangdui find is available&nbsp;on
YouTube and&nbsp;the Hunan Provincial Museum website also provides
useful information.</p>

<p>
Before this find, access to the <em>Laozi</em> was mainly through the
received text of Wang Bi (226&ndash;249 C.E.) and Heshang Gong, a
legendary figure depicted as a teacher to Emperor Wen (r.
179&ndash;157 B.C.E.) of the Han dynasty. There are other manuscript
versions, but by and large they play a secondary role in the history
of the classic.</p>

<p>
A more recent archaeological find in Guodian, Jingmen city, Hubei
province, the so-called &ldquo;Bamboo-slip <em>Laozi</em>,&rdquo;
which predates the Mawangdui manuscripts, has rekindled debates on the
origin and composition of the <em>Laozi</em>. But first, a note on the
title and structure of the <em>Daodejing</em>.</p>

<p>
The <em>Laozi</em> did not acquire its &ldquo;classic&rdquo; status
until the Han dynasty. According to the <em>Shiji</em> (49.5b), the
Empress Dowager Dou&mdash;wife of Emperor Wen and mother of Emperor
Jing (r. 156&ndash;141 B.C.E.)&mdash;was a dedicated student of the
<em>Laozi</em>. Later sources added that it was Emperor Jing who
established the text officially as a classic. However, the title
<em>Daodejing</em> appears not to have been widely used until later,
toward the close of the Han era.</p>

<p>
The <em>Daodejing</em> is also referred to as the <em>Daode
zhenjing</em> (True Classic of the Way and Virtue), the <em>Taishang
xuanyuan daodejing</em> (Classic of the Way and Virtue of the Highest
Profound Origins), and less formally the &ldquo;five-thousand
character&rdquo; text, on account of its approximate length. Most
versions exceed five thousand characters by about five to ten percent,
but it is interesting to note that numerological considerations later
became an integral part of the history of the work. According to the
seventh-century Daoist master Cheng Xuanying, it was Ge Xuan (fl. 200
C.E.), a revered Daoist adept, who shortened the <em>Laozi</em> text
that accompanied the Heshang Gong commentary to fit the magical number
of five thousand. This claim cannot be verified, but a number
of&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em> manuscripts discovered at Dunhuang contain
4,999 characters. Indeed, had the compound numeral
&ldquo;<em>sanshi</em>,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;thirty,&rdquo;&nbsp;in
chapter 11 not been abbreviated to a single character
(&ldquo;<em>sa</em>&rdquo;),&nbsp;they would contain exactly 5,000
characters.</p>

<p>
The current <em>Daodejing</em> is divided into two parts
(<em>pian</em>) and 81 sections (<em>zhang</em>). For ease of
reference, I will refer to the sections as
&ldquo;chapters,&rdquo;&nbsp;aligned with most translations. Part one,
comprising chapters 1&ndash;37, has come to be known as the
<em>Daojing</em> (Classic of Dao), while chapters 38&ndash;81 make up
the <em>Dejing</em> (Classic of Virtue).</p>

<p>
This is understood to be a thematic division&mdash;chapter 1 begins
with the word Dao, while chapter 38 begins with the phrase
&ldquo;superior virtue&rdquo;&mdash;although the concepts of Dao and
virtue (<em>de</em>) feature in both parts. As a rough heuristic
guide, some commentators have suggested that the <em>Daojing</em> is
more &ldquo;metaphysical,&rdquo; whereas the <em>Dejing</em> focuses
more on sociopolitical issues.</p>

<p>
In this context, it is easy to appreciate the tremendous interest
occasioned by the discovery of the Mawangdui <em>Laozi</em>
manuscripts. The two manuscripts contain all the chapters that are
found in the current <em>Laozi</em>, although the chapters follow a
different order in a few places. For example, in both manuscripts, the
sections that appear as chapters 80 and 81 in the current
<em>Laozi</em> come immediately after a section that corresponds to
chapter 66 of the present text.</p>

<p>
Both the Mawangdui &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; manuscripts are
similarly divided into two parts, but in contrast with the current
version, in reverse order; i.e., both manuscripts begin with the
<em>Dejing</em>, corresponding to chapter 38 of the received text.
&ldquo;Part one&rdquo; of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; manuscript ends with the
editorial notation, &ldquo;Virtue, 3,041 [characters],&rdquo; while
the last line of &ldquo;Part two&rdquo; reads: &ldquo;Dao,
2,426.&rdquo; Does this mean that the classic should be renamed, from
<em>Daodejing</em> to &ldquo;<em>Dedaojing</em>&rdquo; (Classic of
Virtue and the Way)? One scholar, in fact, has adopted the title
<em>Dedaojing</em> (<em>Te-Tao ching</em>) for his translation of the
Mawangdui <em>Laozi</em> (Henricks 1989).</p>

<p>
It seems unlikely that the Mawangdui arrangement stems simply from
scribal idiosyncrasy or happenstance&mdash;e.g., that the copyist, in
writing out the <em>Laozi</em> on silk, had made use of an original
text in bamboo slips and just happened to start with a bundle of slips
containing the <em>Dejing</em> (Yan 1976, 12, explains how this is
possible). If the order is deliberate, does it imply that the
&ldquo;original&rdquo; <em>Laozi</em> gives priority to sociopolitical
issues? This raises important questions for interpretation.</p>

<p>
The division into 81 chapters reflects numerological interest and is
associated particularly with the Heshang Gong version, which also
carries chapter titles. It was not universally accepted until much
later, perhaps the Tang period, when the text was standardized under
the patronage of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712&ndash;756). Traditional
sources report that some versions were divided into 64, 68, or 72
chapters; and some did not have chapter divisions (Henricks 1982).</p>

<p>
The Mawangdui &ldquo;A&rdquo; manuscript contains in some places a dot
or &ldquo;period&rdquo; that appears to signal the beginning of a
chapter. The earlier Guodian texts (see below) are not divided into
two parts, but in many places they employ a black square mark to
indicate the end of a section. The sections or chapters so marked
generally agree with the division in the present <em>Laozi</em>. Thus,
although the 81-chapter formation may be relatively late, some attempt
at chapter division seems evident from an early stage of the textual
history of the <em>Daodejing</em>.</p>

<p>
In late 1993, the excavation of a tomb (identified as M1) in
Guodian,&nbsp;Hubei province, yielded among other things some 800
bamboo slips, of which 730 are inscribed, containing over 13,000
Chinese characters. Some of these, amounting to about 2,000
characters, match the <em>Laozi</em> (see Allan and Williams 2000, and
Henricks 2000). The tomb is located near the old capital of the state
of Chu and is dated around 300 B.C.E. Robbers had entered the tomb
before it was excavated, although the extent of the damage is
uncertain.</p>

<p>
The bamboo texts, written in a Chu script, have been transcribed into
standard Chinese and published under the title <em>Guodian Chumu
zhujian</em> (Beijing: Wenwu, 1998), which on the basis of the size
and shape of the slips, calligraphy, and other factors divides the
<em>Laozi</em> material into three groups. Group A contains
thirty-nine bamboo slips, which correspond in whole or in part to the
following chapters of the present text: 19, 66, 46, 30, 15, 64, 37,
63, 2, 32, 25, 5, 16, 64, 56, 57, 55, 44, 40 and 9. Groups B and C are
smaller, with eighteen (chs. 59, 48, 20, 13, 41, 52, 45, 54) and
fourteen slips (chs. 17, 18, 35, 31, 64), respectively.</p>

<p>
On the whole, the Guodian &ldquo;bamboo-slip <em>Laozi</em>&rdquo; is
consistent with the received text, although the placement or sequence
of the chapters is different and there are numerous variants or
archaic characters.&nbsp; Particularly, whereas chapter 19 of the
current <em>Laozi</em> contains what appears to be a strong attack on
Confucian ideals&mdash;&ldquo;Cut off benevolence (<em>ren</em>),
discard rightness (<em>yi</em>)&rdquo;&mdash;the Guodian
&ldquo;A&rdquo; text directs its readers to &ldquo;cut off
artificiality, discard deceit.&rdquo; This has been taken to suggest
that in the course of its transmission, the <em>Laozi</em> has taken
on a more &ldquo;polemical&rdquo; outlook. However, the Guodian
&ldquo;C&rdquo; text indicates that <em>ren</em> and <em>yi</em> arose
only after the &ldquo;Great Dao&rdquo; had gone into decline, which
agrees with chapter 18 of the current <em>Laozi</em>. In other words,
it would seem rather&nbsp;hasty to conclude that&nbsp;the Guodian
texts do not engage in a critique of some of the key ideas central to
the &ldquo;Ru&rdquo; or Confucian tradition.</p>

<p>
It is unclear whether the Guodian bamboo slips&nbsp;were copied from
one source and meant to be read as one text divided into three parts,
whether they were &ldquo;selections&rdquo; from a longer original, or
whether they were three different texts copied from different sources
at different times (for a nuanced discussion, see Boltz 1999). There
is one important clue, however. The &ldquo;A&rdquo; and
&ldquo;C&rdquo; texts give two different versions of what is now part
of chapter 64 of the <em>Laozi</em>, which suggests that they came
from different sources. One scholar at least has suggested a
chronology to the making of the Guodian <em>Laozi</em> bamboo slips,
with the &ldquo;A&rdquo; group being the oldest of the three, copied
around 400 B.C.E. (Ding 2000). In any case, they remain the oldest
extant <em>Laozi</em> texts to date (on the Guodian find, see Cook
2012).</p>

<p>
Taking into account all the available evidence, it thus seems likely
that different collections of sayings attributed to Laozi expanded and
gained currency during the fourth century B.C.E. They would have been
derived from earlier, oral or written sources. During the third
century B.C.E., the <em>Laozi</em> settled more or less into its final
form. It was then quoted extensively in such works as the
<em>Hanfeizi</em> and the &ldquo;outer&rdquo; and
&ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; chapters of the <em>Zhuangzi</em>, and
began to attract commentarial attention.</p>

<p>
More recently, the growing family of <em>Laozi</em> texts welcomed yet
another new arrival. In January 2009, Peking University reportedly
accepted a gift of a sizeable collection of inscribed bamboo
slips&nbsp;retrieved from overseas. Among them, we find a nearly
complete version of the <em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
Although the authenticity of these slips has&nbsp;been challenged, the
consensus among the scholars who have worked with them is that they
date to the Western Han dynasty. More precisely, based especially on
the calligraphic form of the writing&mdash;a relatively mature form of
the &ldquo;clerical&rdquo; script established during the Han
period&mdash;they have been dated to the second half of the reign of
Emperor Wu of the Han (141&ndash;87 B.C.E.).</p>

<p>
Like the Mawangdui silk manuscripts, the Peking University text, now
referred to as the &ldquo;Beida <em>Laozi</em>,&rdquo; is divided into
two parts. They are titled &ldquo;Laozi Classic, Part 1&rdquo;
(<em>Laozi shang jing</em>) and &ldquo;Laozi Classic, Part 2&rdquo;
(<em>Laozi xia jing</em>). This indicates that not only the
<em>Laozi</em> was divided into two parts during the Western Han
period, but also it was accorded the status of a &ldquo;classic&rdquo;
(<em>jing</em>), which may give some credence to the traditional claim
that the <em>Laozi</em> achieved canonical status during the preceding
reign of Emperor Jing (156&ndash;141 B.C.E.).</p>

<p>
The Beida <em>Laozi</em> agrees with the Mawangdui manuscripts in
another important respect; that is, Part 1 also corresponds to
chapters 38&ndash;81 of the current 81-chapter version, or the
<em>Dejing</em>, and Part 2, to chapters 1&ndash;37, or
<em>Daojing</em>. Although this cannot be taken to mean that the
<em>Laozi</em> was &ldquo;originally&rdquo; written in that order, it
may be the case that this was the dominant textual tradition during
the Han period. Like the Mawangdui manuscripts, the Beida
<em>Laozi</em> also records the number of characters or graphs&nbsp;at
the end of each part.</p>

<p>
In terms of wording, the Beida <em>Laozi</em> agrees with the
Mawangdui manuscripts in many instances, although in some places it
agrees rather with that of the received text. For example, whereas
Chapter 22 of the received text describes the sage as a
&ldquo;model&rdquo; (<em>shi</em>) for the world, the Beida
<em>Laozi</em> agrees with the Mawangdui versions in likening the sage
more concretely to a &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo; (<em>mu</em>). However,
the Beida text agrees with the standard version at the beginning of
Chapter 2, as opposed to the shorter formulation found in the Guodian
and Mawangdui versions.</p>

<p>
What is equally significant is that the sequence or order of the
chapters is exactly the same as that in the received <em>Laozi</em>.
The difference lies in the division of some of the chapters. Chapters
17&ndash;19 of the received text form one chapter in the Beida
<em>Laozi</em>. The same is true for chapters 6&ndash;7, 32&ndash;33
and 78&ndash;79. However, the current chapter 64 appears as two
chapters in the Beida slips. Altogether there are 77 chapters. Each
chapter is clearly marked, with a round dot at the start, and each
chapter starts on a separate bamboo slip.</p>

<p>
The Beida <em>Laozi</em> is almost intact in its entirety, missing
only some 60 characters when compared with the received text. While it
offers fresh glimpses into the development of the text, it does not
provide any significant new insight into the meaning of the
<em>Laozi</em>. A series of articles on the Peking University bamboo
slips were published in the journal <em>Wenwu</em> (2011, no. 6). The
Beida <em>Laozi</em> was published in December 2012 and launched in
February 2013. Although the majority of scholars accept the
authenticity of the find, a notable critic is Xing Wen, who argues
strongly that it is a forgery (Xing 2016; for a critical discussion in
English, see Foster 2017).</p>

<p>
In summary, two approaches to the making of the <em>Laozi</em> warrant
consideration, for they bear directly on interpretation.</p>

<p>
A linear &ldquo;evolutionary&rdquo; model of textual formation would
suggest that the earliest sayings attributed to Laozi address
principally issues of governance, reflecting a deep concern with the
decline of Zhou rule. Some of these sayings were preserved in the
Guodian bamboo texts.</p>

<p>
On this view, the <em>Laozi</em> underwent substantial change and grew
into a longer and more complex work during the third century B.C.E.,
becoming in this process more polemical against the Confucian and
other schools of thought, and acquiring new material of stronger
metaphysical or cosmological interest. The Mawangdui manuscripts were
based on this maturing&nbsp;version of the <em>Laozi</em>; the
original emphasis on ethics and politics, however, can still be
detected in the placement of the <em>Dejing</em> before the
<em>Daojing</em>. Later versions reversed this order and in so doing
subsumed politics and self-cultivation&nbsp;under a broader
philosophical vision of Dao as the beginning and end of all
beings.</p>

<p>
As distinguished from a linear evolutionary model, what is suggested
here is that there were different collections of sayings attributed to
Laozi, overlapping to some extent but each with its own emphases and
predilections, inhabiting a particular interpretive context.</p>

<p>
Although some key chapters in the current <em>Laozi</em> that deal
with the nature of Dao (e.g., chs. 1, 14) are not found in the Guodian
corpus, the idea that the Dao is &ldquo;born before heaven and
earth,&rdquo; for example, which is found in chapter 25 of the
received text, is already present. The critical claim that
&ldquo;being [<em>you</em>] is born of nonbeing [<em>wu</em>]&rdquo;
in chapter 40 (see further discussion in Section 6 below) also figures
in the Guodian &ldquo;A&rdquo; text. This seems to argue against the
suggestion that the <em>Laozi</em>, and for that matter ancient
Chinese philosophical works in general, were not interested or lacked
the ability to engage in abstract philosophic thinking, an assumption
that sometimes appears to underlie evolutionary approaches to the
development of Chinese philosophy.</p>

<p>
The Guodian and Mawangdui finds are extremely valuable. They are
syntactically clearer than the received text in some instances, thanks
to the larger number of grammatical particles they employ.
Nevertheless, they cannot resolve all the controversies and
uncertainties surrounding the <em>Laozi</em>. In my view, the nature
of Dao and the application of Daoist insight to ethics and governance
formed the twin foci in collections of Laozi sayings from the start.
They were then developed in several ways&mdash;e.g., some collections
were combined; new sayings were added; and explanatory comments,
illustrations, and elaboration on individual sayings were integrated
into the text. The demand for textual uniformity rose when the
<em>Laozi</em> gained recognition, and consequently the different
textual traditions eventually gave way to the received text of the
<em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
As mentioned, the current <em>Laozi</em> on which most reprints,
studies and translations are based is the version that comes down to
us along with the commentaries by Wang Bi and Heshang Gong. Three
points need to be made in this regard.</p>

<p>
First, technically there are multiple versions of the Wang Bi and
Heshang Gong <em>Laozi</em>&mdash;over thirty Heshang Gong versions
are extant&mdash;but the differences are on the whole minor. Second,
the Wang Bi and Heshang Gong versions are not the same, but they are
sufficiently similar to be classified as belonging to the same line of
textual transmission. Third, the Wang Bi and Heshang Gong versions
that we see today have suffered change. Prior to the invention of
printing, when each manuscript had to be copied by hand, editorial
changes and scribal errors are to be expected. In particular, the
<em>Laozi</em> text that now accompanies Wang Bi&rsquo;s commentary
bears the imprint of later alteration, mainly under the influence of
the Heshang Gong version, and cannot be regarded as the <em>Laozi</em>
that Wang Bi himself had seen and commented on. Boltz (1985) and
Wagner (1989) have examined this question in some detail.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;current&rdquo; version refers to the <em>Sibu beiyao</em>
and the <em>Sibu congkan</em> editions of the <em>Daodejing</em>. (The
<em>Sibu beiyao</em> and <em>Sibu congkan</em> are large-scale
reproductions of traditional Chinese texts published in the early
twentieth century.) The former contains the Wang Bi version and
commentary, which is based on a Ming-dynasty&nbsp;edition (see
especially Hatano 1979).&nbsp;The Heshang Gong version preserved in
the <em>Sibu congkan</em> series is taken from the library of the
famous bibliophile Qu Yong (fl. 1850). According to Qu&rsquo;s own
catalogue, this is a Song dynasty version, published probably after
the reign of the emperor Xiaozong (r. 1163&ndash;1189). Older extant
Heshang Gong versions include two incomplete Tang versions and
fragments found in Dunhuang.</p>

<p>
Besides the Guodian bamboo texts, the Mawangdui silk manuscripts, the
Beida <em>Laozi</em> and the received text of Wang Bi and Heshang
Gong, there is an &ldquo;ancient version&rdquo; (<em>guben</em>)
edited by the early Tang scholar Fu Yi (fl. 600). Reportedly, this
version was recovered from a tomb in 574 C.E., whose occupant was a
consort of the Chu general Xiang Yu (d. 202 B.C.E.). A later redaction
of the &ldquo;ancient version&rdquo; was made by Fan Yingyuan in the
Song dynasty. There are some differences, but these two can be
regarded as having stemmed from the same textual tradition.</p>

<p>
Manuscript fragments discovered in the Dunhuang caves form another
important source in <em>Laozi</em> research. Among them are several
Heshang Gong fragments (especially S. 477 and S. 3926 in the Stein
collection, and P. 2639 in the Pelliot collection) and the important
<em>Xiang&rsquo;er Laozi</em> with commentary (see the next section).
Another Dunhuang manuscript that merits attention is the &ldquo;Suo
Dan&rdquo; fragment, now at the University Art Museum, Princeton
University, which contains the last thirty-one chapters of the
<em>Daodejing</em> beginning with chapter 51 of the modern text. It is
signed and dated at the end, bearing the name of the third-century
scholar and diviner Suo Dan, who is said to have made the copy,
written in ink on paper, in 270 C.E. According to Rao Zongyi (1955),
the Suo Dan version belongs to the Heshang Gong line of the
<em>Laozi</em> text. William Boltz (1996), however, questions its
third-century date and argues that the fragment in many instances also
agrees with the Fu Yi &ldquo;ancient version.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
While manuscript versions inform textual criticism of the
<em>Laozi</em>, stone inscriptions provide further
corroborating&nbsp;support. Over twenty steles, mainly of Tang and
Song origins, are available to textual critics, although some are in
poor condition (Yan 1957). Students of the <em>Laozi</em> today can
work with several Chinese and Japanese studies that make use of a
large number of manuscript versions and stone inscriptions (notably Ma
1965, Jiang 1980, Zhu 1980, and Shima 1973). Boltz (1993) offers an
excellent introduction to the manuscript traditions of the
<em>Laozi</em>. Wagner (2003) attempts to reconstruct the original
face of Wang Bi&rsquo;s <em>Laozi</em> (cf. Lou 1980 and Lynn 1999). A
major contribution to <em>Laozi</em> studies in Chinese is Liu Xiaogan
2006, which compares the Guodian, Mawangdui, Fu Yi, Wang Bi, and
Heshang Gong versions of the <em>Laozi</em> and provides detailed
textual and interpretive analysis for each chapter. In an article in
English, Liu (2003) sets out some of his main findings.</p>

<h2 id="Com">4. Commentaries</h2>

<p>
Commentaries to the <em>Laozi</em> offer an invaluable guide to
interpretation and are important also for their own contributions to
Chinese philosophy and religion.</p>

<p>
Two chapters in the current <em>Hanfeizi</em> (chs. 21 and 22) are
entitled &ldquo;Explaining (the Sayings of) <em>Laozi</em>&rdquo;
(<em>Jie Lao</em>) and &ldquo;Illustrating (the Sayings of)
<em>Laozi</em>&rdquo; (<em>Yu Lao</em>), which can be regarded as the
earliest extant commentary on&nbsp;the classic (Queen 2013). A new
translation by Eric Hutton accompanied by several studies is
forthcoming in 2026.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;bibliographical&rdquo; section of the <em>Hanshu</em>
(History of the Former or Western Han Dynasty) lists four commentaries
to the <em>Laozi</em>, but they have not survived. Nevertheless,
<em>Laozi</em> learning began to flourish from the Han period. The
commentaries by Heshang Gong, Yan Zun, Wang Bi, and the
<em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em> commentary will be introduced in what follows.
Some mention will also be made of later developments in the history of
the <em>Daodejing</em>. The late Isabelle Robinet has contributed an
important pioneering study of the early <em>Laozi</em> commentaries
(1977; see also Robinet 1998).</p>

<p>
Traditionally, the Heshang Gong commentary is regarded as a product of
the early Han dynasty. The name Heshang Gong means an old master
(<em>gong</em>)&nbsp;who dwells by the side of a river (<em>he
shang</em>). An expert on the <em>Laozi</em>, he caught the attention
of Emperor Wen, who went personally to consult him. Heshang Gong
revealed to the emperor his true identity as a divine emissary sent by
the &ldquo;Supreme Lord of the Dao&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., the divine
Laozi&mdash;to teach him. The emperor proved a humble student, as the
legend concludes, worthy of receiving the <em>Daodejing</em> with
Heshang Gong&rsquo;s commentary (A. Chan 1991).</p>

<p>
Recent Chinese studies generally place the commentary at the end of
the Han period, although some Japanese scholars would date it to as
late as the sixth century C.E. It is probably a second-century C.E.
work and reflects the influence of the &ldquo;Huang-Lao&rdquo; (Yellow
Emperor and Laozi) tradition, which flourished during the early Han
dynasty (A. Chan 1991a).</p>

<p>
Called in early sources the <em>Laozi zhangju</em>, it belongs to the
genre of <em>zhangju</em> literature, prevalent in Han times, which
one may paraphrase as commentary by &ldquo;section and semantic
units.&rdquo; Its language is simple; its imagination, down-to-earth.
The Heshang Gong commentary shares with other Han works the belief
that the universe is constituted by <em>qi</em>, the energy-like
building blocks of life and the vital constituent of the cosmos,
variously translated as &ldquo;vital energy,&rdquo;
&ldquo;life-force,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pneuma.&rdquo; On this basis,
interpreting the text in terms of yin-yang theory, the <em>Laozi</em>
is seen to disclose not only the mystery of the origins of the
universe but also the secret to personal well-being and sociopolitical
order.</p>

<p>
What the <em>Laozi</em> calls the &ldquo;One,&rdquo; according to
Heshang Gong, refers to the purest and most potent form of
<em>qi</em>-energy that brings forth and continues to nourish all
beings. This is the meaning of <em>de</em>, the &ldquo;virtue&rdquo;
or power with which the &ldquo;ten thousand things&rdquo;&mdash;i.e.,
all beings&mdash;have been endowed and without which life would
cease.</p>

<p>
The maintenance of &ldquo;virtue,&rdquo; which the commentary also
describes as &ldquo;guarding the One,&rdquo; is thus crucial to
self-cultivation. A careful diet, exercise, and some form of
meditation are implied, but generally the commentary focuses on
diminishing desire, which brings into view the ethical dimension of
<em>qi</em>-cultivation.</p>

<p>
The government of the &ldquo;sage&rdquo;&mdash;a term common to all
schools of Chinese thought but which is given a distinctive Daoist
meaning in the commentary&mdash;rests on the same premise. Policies
that are harmful to the people such as heavy taxation and severe
punishment are to be avoided, but the most fundamental point remains
that the ruler himself must cherish what the <em>Laozi</em> calls
&ldquo;emptiness&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonaction.&rdquo; Disorder stems
from the dominance of desire, which reflects the unruly presence of
confused and agitated <em>qi</em>-energy. In this way,
self-cultivation and government are shown to form an integral whole
(see Section 7 below and A. Chan 2025).</p>

<p>
A second major commentary is the <em>Laozi zhigui</em> (The Essential
Meaning of the <em>Laozi</em>) attributed to the Han dynasty scholar
Yan Zun (fl. 83 B.C.E.&ndash;10 C.E.). Styled Junping, Yan&rsquo;s
surname was originally Zhuang; it was changed in later written records
to the semantically similar Yan to comply with the legal restriction
not to use the name Zhuang, which was the personal name of Emperor
Ming (r. 57&ndash;75) of the Later or Eastern Han dynasty. Yan Zun is
well remembered in traditional sources as a recluse of great learning
and integrity, a diviner of legendary ability, and an author of
exceptional talent. The famous Han poet and philosopher Yang Xiong (53
B.C.E.&ndash;18 C.E.) studied under Yan and spoke glowingly of
him.</p>

<p>
The <em>Laozi zhigui</em> (abbreviated hereafter as <em>Zhigui</em>),
as it now stands, is incomplete; only the commentary to the
<em>Dejing</em>, chapters 38&ndash;81 of the current <em>Laozi</em>,
remains. The best edition of the <em>Zhigui</em> is that contained in
the <em>Daozang</em> (Daoist Canon, no. 693), which clearly indicates
that the work had originally thirteen <em>juan</em> or scrolls, the
first six of which have been lost. Judging from the available
evidence, it can be accepted as a Han product (A. Chan 1998a). The
<em>Laozi</em> text that accompanies Yan Zun&rsquo;s commentary agrees
in many instances with the wording of the Mawangdui silk
manuscripts.</p>

<p>
Like Heshang Gong, Yan Zun also subscribes to the yin-yang
cosmological theory characteristic of Han thought. Unlike Heshang
Gong&rsquo;s commentary, however, the <em>Zhigui</em> does not
prescribe a program of nourishing one&rsquo;s <em>qi</em> endowment or
actively cultivating &ldquo;long life.&rdquo; This does not mean that
it rejects the ideal of longevity. On the contrary, it recognizes that
the Dao &ldquo;lives forever and does not die&rdquo; (8.9b), and that
the man of Dao, correspondingly, &ldquo;enjoys long life&rdquo;
(7.2a). Valuing one&rsquo;s spirit and vital energy is important, but
the <em>Zhigui</em> is concerned that self-cultivation must not
violate the principle of &ldquo;nonaction.&rdquo; Any effort contrary
to what the <em>Laozi</em> has termed &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo;
(<em>ziran</em>) is counter-productive and doomed to failure.</p>

<p>
The concept of <em>ziran</em> occupies a pivotal position in Yan
Zun&rsquo;s commentary. It describes the nature of the Dao and its
manifestation in the world. It also points to an ethical ideal. The
way in which natural phenomena operate reflects the workings of the
Dao. The &ldquo;sage&rdquo; follows the Dao in that he, too, abides by
naturalness. In practice this means attending to one&rsquo;s
&ldquo;heart-mind&rdquo; (<em>xin</em>) so that it will not be
enslaved by desire. Significantly, the <em>Zhigui</em> suggests that
just as the sage &ldquo;responds&rdquo; to the Dao in being simple and
empty of desire, the common people would in turn respond to the sage
and entrust the empire to him. In this way, the <em>Laozi</em> is seen
to offer a comprehensive guide to order and harmony at all levels.</p>

<p>
An early commentary that maximizes the religious import of the
<em>Laozi</em> is the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er Commentary</em>. Although it
is mentioned in catalogues of Daoist works, there was no real
knowledge of it until a copy was discovered among the Dunhuang
manuscripts (S. 6825 in the Stein collection). The manuscript copy,
now housed in the British Library, was probably made around 500 C.E.
The original text, disagreement among scholars notwithstanding, is
generally traced to around 200 C.E. It is closely linked to the
&ldquo;Way of the Celestial Masters&rdquo; and has been ascribed to
Zhang Daoling, the founder of the sect, or his grandson Zhang Lu, who
was instrumental in ensuring the group&rsquo;s survival after the
collapse of the Han dynasty. Stephen Bokenkamp (1997) offers
a&nbsp;detailed study and translation of the work.</p>

<p>
The <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em> manuscript is unfortunately incomplete;
only the first part has survived, beginning with the middle of chapter
3 and ending with chapter 37 in the current chapter division of the
<em>Laozi</em>. It is not clear what the title,
<em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em>, means. Following Rao Zongyi and &#332;fuchi
Ninji, Bokenkamp suggests that it is best understood in the literal
sense that the Dao &ldquo;thinks (<em>xiang</em>) of you
(<em>er</em>)&rdquo; (1997, 61). This underscores the central thesis
of the commentary, that devotion to the Dao in terms of
self-cultivation and compliance with its precepts would
ensure&nbsp;boundless blessing in this life and beyond.</p>

<p>
The <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em> commentary accepts without question the
divine status of Laozi. While Yan Zun and Heshang Gong direct their
commentary primarily to those in a position to effect political
change, the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em> invites a larger audience to
participate in the quest for the Dao, to achieve union with the Dao
through spiritual and moral discipline. It is possible to attain
extraordinary longevity like those who have attained a transcendent
state of being. Nourishing one&rsquo;s vital <em>qi</em>-energy
through meditation and other practices is key to attaining &ldquo;long
life&rdquo; and ultimately forming a spiritual body devoid of the
blemishes of mundane existence (Rao 1991; see also Puett 2004).</p>

<p>
Spiritual discipline, however, is insufficient; equally important is
the accumulation of moral merit. Later Daoist sources refer to the
&ldquo;nine precepts&rdquo; of the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em>. There is
also a longer set known as the &ldquo;twenty-seven precepts&rdquo; of
the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em>. These include general positive steps such
as being tranquil and yielding, as well as specific injunctions
against envy, killing, and other morally reprehensible acts. Likening
the human body to the walls of a pond, the essential
<em>qi</em>-energy to the water in it, and good deeds the source of
the water, the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em> commentary makes clear that
deficiency in any of these&nbsp;would lead to disastrous consequences
(Bokenkamp 1993).</p>

<p>
Compared with the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em>, Wang Bi&rsquo;s
<em>Laozi</em> commentary could not be more different. There is no
reference to &ldquo;immortals&rdquo;; no deified Laozi. The
<em>Daodejing</em>, as Wang Bi sees it, is fundamentally not concerned
with the art of &ldquo;long life&rdquo; but offers profound insight
into the radical otherness of Dao as the source of being&nbsp;and the
practical implications that follow from it.</p>

<p>
Wang Bi (226&ndash;249) was one of the acknowledged leaders of the
movement of &ldquo;Learning in the Profound&rdquo; (<em>Xuanxue</em>)
that came into prominence during the Wei period (220&ndash;265) and
dominated the Chinese intellectual scene well into the sixth
century.</p>

<p>
The word <em>xuan</em> denotes literally a shade of black with dark
red and is used in the <em>Laozi</em> (esp. ch. 1) to suggest the
indescribable profundity&nbsp;of Dao, transcending ordinary perception
and comprehension. The movement has been termed, perhaps not without
ambiguity, &ldquo;Neo-Daoism&rdquo; in some studies. It signifies a
broad philosophical front united in its attempt to discern the
&ldquo;true&rdquo; meaning of Dao but not a homogeneous or partisan
school. Alarmed by what they saw as the decline of Dao, influential
intellectuals of the day initiated a sweeping reinterpretation of the
classical heritage. They did not neglect the Confucian classics but
drew inspiration especially from the <em>Yijing</em>, the
<em>Laozi</em>, and the <em>Zhuangzi</em>, which were then referred to
as the &ldquo;Three (Classics on the) Profound&rdquo;
(<em>sanxuan</em>); that is to say, the three key treatises unlocking
the mystery of Dao. Wang Bi, despite his short life, distinguished
himself as a brilliant interpreter of the <em>Laozi</em> and the
<em>Yijing</em> (see A. Chan 1991a, Wagner 2000, Lynn 2015, and
 <a href="../neo-daoism/">Neo-Daoism</a>&nbsp;in
 this <em>Encyclopedia</em>).</p>

<p>
According to Wang Bi, the concept of Dao indeed points to the
&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; of the &ldquo;ten thousand things.&rdquo;
Unlike Heshang Gong or the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em>, however, he did
not pursue a cosmological or religious interpretation of the process
of creation. Rather, Wang seems more concerned with what may be called
the logic of creation.</p>

<p>
Dao constitutes the absolute &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; in that all
beings have causes and conditions that derive logically from a
necessary foundation. The ground of being, however, cannot be itself a
being; otherwise, infinite regress would render the logic of the
<em>Laozi</em> suspect. For this reason, the <em>Laozi</em> would only
speak of Dao as &ldquo;nonbeing&rdquo; (<em>wu</em>). We will come
back to this point in Section 6 below.</p>

<p>
The transcendence of Dao must not be compromised. To do justice to the
<em>Laozi</em>, it is also important to show how the function of Dao
translates into basic &ldquo;principles&rdquo; (<em>li</em>) governing
the universe. The regularity of the seasons, the plenitude of nature,
and other expressions of &ldquo;heaven and earth&rdquo; all attest to
the presence of Dao. Human beings also conform to these
principles&nbsp;and in this sense&nbsp;are &ldquo;modeled&rdquo;
ultimately after Dao, as the <em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;intimates.</p>

<p>
Wang Bi is often praised in later sources for having given the concept
of <em>li</em>, &ldquo;principle,&rdquo; its first extended
philosophical treatment. In the realm of Dao, principles are
characterized by &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; (<em>ziran</em>) and
&ldquo;nonaction&rdquo; (<em>wuwei</em>). Wang Bi defines
<em>ziran</em> as &ldquo;an expression of the ultimate.&rdquo; In this
regard, attention has been drawn to Yan Zun&rsquo;s influence.
Nonaction helps explain the practical meaning of naturalness. In
ethical terms, Wang Bi takes nonaction to mean freedom from the
dictates of desire. This defines not only the goal of self-cultivation
but also that of government. The concepts of naturalness and nonaction
will be discussed further below. Wang Bi&rsquo;s <em>Laozi</em>
commentary has exerted a strong influence on modern interpretations of
the <em>Laozi</em>. There are four English translations available (Lin
1977, Rump 1979, Lynn 1999, and Wagner 2003).</p>

<p>
Among these four commentaries, Heshang Gong&rsquo;s <em>Laozi
zhangju</em> occupied the position of preeminence in traditional
China, at least until the Song dynasty. For a long period, Wang
Bi&rsquo;s work was relatively neglected. The authority of the Heshang
Gong commentary can be traced to its place in the Daoist religion,
where it ranks second only to the <em>Daodejing</em> itself. Besides
Heshang Gong&rsquo;s work and the <em>Xiang&rsquo;er</em>, there are
two other commentaries, the <em>Laozi jiejie</em> (Sectional
Explanation) and the <em>Laozi neijie</em> (Inner Explanation), that
are closely associated with religious Daoism. Both have been ascribed
to Yin Xi, the keeper of the pass who &ldquo;persuaded&rdquo; Laozi to
write the <em>Daodejing</em> and who, according to Daoist hagiographic
records, later studied under the divine Laozi and became an
&ldquo;immortal.&rdquo; These texts, however, only survive in
citations (see Kusuyama 1979).</p>

<p>
From the Tang period, one begins to find serious attempts to collect
and classify the growing number of <em>Laozi</em> commentaries. An
early pioneer is the eighth-century Daoist master Zhang Junxiang, who
cited some thirty commentaries in his study of the <em>Daodejing</em>
(Wang Zhongmin&nbsp;1981). Du Guangting (850&ndash;933) provided a
larger collection, involving some sixty commentaries (<em>Daode
zhenjing guangshengyi</em>, <em>Daozang</em> no. 725). According to
Du, there were those who saw the <em>Laozi</em> as a political text,
while others focused on spiritual self-cultivation. There were
Buddhist interpreters (e.g., Kum&#257;raj&#299;va and Sengzhao), and
there were those who explained the &ldquo;Twofold Mystery&rdquo;
(<em>Chongxuan</em>). This latter represents an important development
in the history of interpretation of the <em>Daodejing</em> (Assandri
2009).</p>

<p>
The term &ldquo;Twofold Mystery&rdquo; comes from chapter 1 of the
<em>Laozi</em>, where Dao is metaphorically described as &ldquo;dark
upon dark,&rdquo;&nbsp;or&nbsp;the mystery of all mysteries, in the
sense of an incomparably profound reality beyond ordinary
comprehension (<em>xuan zhi you xuan</em>). As a school of Daoist
learning, &ldquo;Twofold Mystery&rdquo; seizes this to be the key to
understanding the <em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
Daoist sources relate that the school goes back to the fourth-century
master Sun Deng. Through Gu Huan (fifth century) and others, the
school reached its height during the Tang period, represented by such
thinkers as Cheng Xuanying and Li Rong in the seventh century. The
school reflects the growing interaction between Daoist and Buddhist
thought, particularly M&#257;dhyamika philosophy. Unlike Wang Bi, it
sees &ldquo;nonbeing&rdquo; as equally one-sided as
&ldquo;being&rdquo; when applied to the transcendence of Dao. Nonbeing
may highlight the profundity or unfathomable depth&nbsp;of Dao, but it
does not yet reach the highest truth, which according to Cheng
Xuanying can be called the &ldquo;Dao of Middle Oneness&rdquo; (Kohn
1992, 144; Assandri 2009 and&nbsp;2022). Like other polar opposites,
the distinction between being and nonbeing must also be
&ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; before one can achieve union with Dao.</p>

<p>
The <em>Laozi</em> has been viewed in still other ways. For example, a
Tang commentary by Wang Zhen, the <em>Daodejing lunbing yaoyishu</em>
(<em>Daozang</em> no. 713), presented to Emperor Xianzong (r.
806&ndash;820) in 809, sees the text as a treatise on military
strategy (Rand 1979&ndash;80; see also Wang Ming 1984 and Mukai 1994).
The diversity of interpretation is truly remarkable (see Robinet 1998
for a typological analysis). The <em>Daodejing</em> was given
considerable imperial attention, with no fewer than eight emperors
having composed or at least commissioned a commentary on the work.
These include Emperor Wu and Emperor Jianwen of the Liang dynasty,
Xuanzong of the Tang, Huizong of the Song, and Taizu of the Ming
dynasty (see Liu Cunren 1969 for a discussion of the last three).</p>

<p>
By the thirteenth century, students of the <em>Daodejing</em> were
already blessed, as it were, with an embarrassment of riches, so much
so that Du Daojian (1237&ndash;1318) could not but observe that the
coming of the Dao to the world takes on a different form each time.
That is to say, different commentators were shaped by the spirit of
their age in their approach to the classic, so that it would be
appropriate to speak of a &ldquo;Han <em>Laozi</em>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tang <em>Laozi</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Song
<em>Laozi</em>,&rdquo; each with its own agenda (<em>Xuanjing yuanzhi
fahui</em>, <em>Daozang</em> no. 703). A good number of
<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;commentaries are collected in&nbsp;the
Qing-dynasty work&nbsp;<em>Daozang jiyao</em>&nbsp;(Essentials of the
Daoist Canon), on which see Lai 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="AppLao">5. Approaches to the <em>Laozi</em></h2>

<p>
Is the <em>Laozi</em> a manual of self-cultivation and government? Is
it a metaphysical treatise, or does it harbor deep mystical
insights?</p>

<p>
Chapter 1 of the current <em>Laozi</em> begins with the famous words:
&ldquo;The Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way.&rdquo;
Chapter 10 speaks of nourishing one&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and
embracing the &ldquo;One.&rdquo; Chapter 80 depicts the ideal polity
as a small country with few inhabitants.</p>

<p>
The <em>Laozi</em> is a difficult text. Its language is often cryptic;
the sense or reference of the many symbols it employs remains unclear,
and there seems to be conceptual inconsistencies. For example, whereas
chapter 2 refers to the &ldquo;mutual production of being and
nonbeing,&rdquo; chapter 40 declares, &ldquo;Being originates in
nonbeing&rdquo; (Henricks, trans. 1989). Is it more meaningful to
speak of the &ldquo;worldviews&rdquo; of the <em>Daodejing</em>,
instead of a unified vision?</p>

<p>
If the <em>Laozi</em> were an &ldquo;anthology&rdquo; put together at
random by different compilers over a long period of time, occasional
inconsistencies need not be an issue. Traditionally, however, this was
never a serious option. Most modern studies are equally concerned to
disclose the coherence or unified meaning&nbsp;of the classic. While
some seek to recover the &ldquo;original&rdquo; meaning of the
<em>Laozi</em>, others celebrate its contemporary relevance. Consider,
first of all, some of the main modern approaches to the
<em>Daodejing</em> (cf. Hardy 1998).</p>

<p>
One view is that the <em>Laozi</em> reflects a deep mythological
consciousness at its core. The myth of &ldquo;chaos,&rdquo; in
particular, helps shape the Daoist understanding of the cosmos and the
place of human beings in it (Girardot 1983). Chapter 25, for example,
likens the Dao to an undifferentiated oneness. The myth of a great
mother earth goddess has also been seen to have informed the worldview
of the <em>Laozi</em> (Erkes 1935; Chen 1969), which explains its
emphasis on nature and the feminine (Chen 1989). Chapter 6, for
example, refers to the &ldquo;spirit of the valley,&rdquo; which is
also called the &ldquo;mysterious female.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
A second view is that the <em>Laozi</em> gives voice to a profound
mysticism. According to Victor Mair (1990), it is indebted to Indian
mysticism (see also Waley 1958). According to Benjamin Schwartz
(1985), the mysticism of the <em>Daodejing</em> is <em>sui
generis</em>, uniquely Chinese and has nothing to do with India.
Indeed, as one scholar suggests, it is unlike other mystical writings
in that ecstatic vision does not play a role in the ascent of the
Daoist sage (Welch 1965, 60). According to another interpretation,
however, there is every indication that ecstasy forms a part of the
world of the <em>Laozi</em>, although it is difficult to gauge the
&ldquo;degree&rdquo; of its mystical leanings (Kaltenmark 1969, 65).
As Harold Roth sees it, Daoist &ldquo;inner cultivation&rdquo; and
Indian yoga may be similar, but &ldquo;they are parallel developments
in different cultures at different times.&rdquo; (Roth 1999, 137).</p>

<p>
It is possible to combine these two&nbsp;approaches. Although the
presence of ancient religious beliefs can still be detected, they have
been raised to a &ldquo;higher&rdquo; mystical plane in the
<em>Laozi</em> (e.g., Ching 1997). Broadly, one could carve out a
third category of interpretations that highlights the spiritual
significance of the <em>Laozi</em>, whether in general terms or
aligned with the tenets of religious Daoism.</p>

<p>
A fourth view sees the <em>Laozi</em> mainly as a work of philosophy,
which gives a metaphysical account of reality and insight into Daoist
self-cultivation and government; but fundamentally it is not a work of
mysticism (W. T. Chan 1963). The strong practical interest of the
<em>Laozi</em> distinguishes it from any teachings&nbsp;that
eschew&nbsp;worldly involvement. In H. G. Creel&rsquo;s (1977) words,
it is &ldquo;purposive&rdquo; and not purely
&ldquo;contemplative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Fifth, to many readers the <em>Laozi</em> offers essentially a
philosophy of life. Remnants of an older religious thinking may have
found their way into the text, but they have been transformed into a
naturalistic philosophy. The emphasis on naturalness translates into a
way of life characterized by simplicity, calmness, and freedom from
the tyranny of desire (e.g., Liu Xiaogan 1997). For Roger Ames and
David Hall (2003), indeed, the essence of the <em>Laozi</em> is
&ldquo;making this life significant.&rdquo; Unlike the claim that
the&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;esoteric work&nbsp;directed at
a restricted audience, this view highlights its universal appeal and
contemporary relevance.</p>

<p>
Sixth, the <em>Laozi</em> is above all concerned with realizing peace
and sociopolitical order. It is an ethical and political masterpiece
intended for the ruling class, with concrete strategic suggestions
aimed at remedying the moral and political turmoil engulfing late Zhou
China. Self-cultivation is important, but the ultimate goal extends
beyond personal fulfillment (Lau 1963, LaFargue 1992, Moeller 2006).
The <em>Laozi</em> criticizes the Confucian school not only for being
ineffectual in restoring order but more damagingly as a culprit in
worsening the ills of society at that time. The Daoist ideal points
instead to a pristine state of affairs&nbsp;where people would dwell
in simplicity, harmony and contentment, not fettered by ambition or
desire.</p>

<p>
This list is far from exhaustive. Chad Hansen (1992), for example,
focuses on the &ldquo;anti-language&rdquo; philosophy of the
<em>Laozi</em>. Different combinations are also possible. A. C.
Graham, for example, emphasizes both the mystical and political
elements, arguing that the <em>Laozi</em> was probably targeted at the
ruler of a small state (1989, 234). For Hans-Georg Moeller (2006), the
<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;may have been&nbsp;a work of political philosophy
in its original context, but it offers a powerful critique of
&ldquo;humanism&rdquo; that is ethically as relevant then as it is
now. The <em>Laozi</em> could be seen as encompassing all of the
above&mdash;such categories as the metaphysical, ethical, political,
mystical, and religious form a unified whole in Daoist thinking and
are deemed distinct only in modern Western thought. Alternatively,
coming back to the question of multiple authorship and coherence, it
could be argued that the <em>Laozi</em> contains &ldquo;layers&rdquo;
of material put together by different people at different times
(Emerson 1995).</p>

<p>
Is it fair to say that the <em>Laozi</em> is inherently
&ldquo;polysemic&rdquo; (Robinet 1998), open to diverse
interpretations? This concerns not only the difficulty of the
<em>Laozi</em> but also the interplay between reader and text in any
act of interpretation.</p>

<p>
Polysemy challenges the assertion that the &ldquo;intended&rdquo;
meaning of the <em>Laozi</em> can be recovered fully. However, it is
important to emphasize, it does not follow that context is
unimportant, that parameters do not exist, or that there are no checks
against particular interpretations. While hermeneutic reconstruction
remains an open process, it cannot disregard the rules of evidence.
Questions of provenance, textual variants, as well as the entire
tradition of commentaries and modern scholarship are important for
this reason. And it is for this same reason that
we&nbsp;leave&nbsp;a&nbsp;discussion of the <em>Laozi</em> itself till
the end. The following presents some of the main concepts and symbols
in the <em>Laozi</em> based on the current text, focusing on the key
conceptual cluster of Dao, <em>de</em> (virtue), <em>ziran</em>
(naturalness), and <em>wuwei</em> (nonaction). It seems to
me&nbsp;that the two readings represented by the Heshang Gong and Wang
Bi commentaries both bring out important insight from the
<em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<h2 id="DaoVir">6. Dao and Virtue</h2>

<p>
To begin with &ldquo;Dao,&rdquo; the etymology of the Chinese graph
suggests a pathway, or heading in a certain direction along a path.
Most commentators agree in translating <em>dao</em> as
&ldquo;way.&rdquo; In early Chinese literature, <em>dao</em> generally
depicts a relatively wide thoroughfare or carriage way, and in some
contexts waterways, but it is used also to convey what is deemed the
right or proper course, and by extension the teachings that set forth
such a course, or the means and methods that would bring it about.
<em>Laozi</em> 53, for example, states, &ldquo;The great <em>dao</em>
is very even (flat, easy to travel on), but people like (to take)
by-ways (<em>j&igrave;ng</em>).&rdquo; The literal sense of
<em>dao</em> as a path, contrasted in this instance with
<em>j&igrave;ng</em>, a small trail off the main road, is clearly
preserved here, but it is also easy to see how it can be used as a
metaphor, how the extended ethical and spiritual sense of <em>dao</em>
comes into the picture.</p>

<p>
As a verb, perhaps on account of the directionality involved,
<em>dao</em> also conveys the sense of &ldquo;speaking.&rdquo; A poem
in the <em>Shijing</em>, for example, intimates that what was
spoken&nbsp;(<em>yan</em>) within one&rsquo;s private
chamber&nbsp;must not be told (<em>dao</em>) beyond its walls (Songs
of Yong, &ldquo;Qiang you ci&rdquo;).&nbsp;Thus, the opening phrase of
chapter 1, <em>dao ke dao</em>, literally &ldquo;Dao that can be
dao-ed,&rdquo; is often rendered, &ldquo;The Way that can be spoken
of.&rdquo; Because <em>dao</em> is paired with &ldquo;name&rdquo;
(<em>ming</em>) in the next line&mdash;&ldquo;<em>ming ke
ming</em>,&rdquo; &ldquo;the name that can be
named&rdquo;&mdash;forming a parallel couplet construction, there is
reason to interpret the verbal usage in the sense of something
verbalized, as opposed to a pathway that is travelled on, trodden, or
followed. This is also how most commentators in traditional China have
understood it: the many normative discourses that clamor to represent
the right way are seen to be fickle, partial and misleading. In most
English translations, the capitalized form&mdash;&ldquo;Way&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dao&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Tao&rdquo;)&mdash;is used, to distinguish
it from other usages of the term.</p>

<p>
The concept of <em>dao</em> is not unique to the <em>Laozi</em>. A key
term in the philosophical vocabulary, it informs early Chinese
philosophy as a whole. It is interpreted differently, signifying a
means to a higher end in some writings and as an end in itself in
others. The <em>Laozi</em> underscores both the ineffability and
creative power of Dao. This is distinctive and if one accepts the
early provenance of the text, charts a new course in the development
of Chinese philosophy.</p>

<p>
The ineffability of Dao is highlighted in chapter 1: the
&ldquo;constant&rdquo; (<em>chang</em>, also translated as
&ldquo;eternal&rdquo;&mdash;e.g., W. T. Chan 1963) Dao cannot be
defined or described; it is &ldquo;nameless.&rdquo; Chapter 14 brings
out clearly that Dao transcends sensory perception; it has neither
shape nor form. Nameless and formless, Dao can only be described as
utterly profound, and in this sense &ldquo;dark&rdquo; or
&ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; (<em>xuan</em>), or as <em>wu</em>, literally
&ldquo;not having&rdquo; any name, form, or other characteristics of
things (see also chs. 21 and 32). Indeed, though suggestive, the term
&ldquo;Dao&rdquo; itself is no more than a symbol&mdash;as the
<em>Laozi</em> makes clear, &ldquo;I do not know its name; I style it
Dao&rdquo; (ch. 25; see also ch. 34). This suggests a sense of radical
transcendence, which explains why the <em>Laozi</em> has been
approached so often as a work of mysticism.</p>

<p>
The concept of <em>wu</em>&nbsp;is central to understanding the
<em>Laozi.</em>&nbsp;As applied to Dao, it has been translated
variously as &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; &ldquo;nothingness,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;nonbeing.&rdquo; It seeks to explain the mystery of Dao by
pointing to&nbsp;its limitlessness and&nbsp;inexhaustibility (e.g.,
ch. 4). Not having any form, Dao cannot be reduced to any particular
thing. Names serve to delimit, to set boundaries; in contrast, Dao is
without limits and therefore cannot be captured fully by language. As
such, Dao can only be described as <em>wu</em>, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;
in this sense.&nbsp;Yet, the <em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;also affirms
the&nbsp;inexhaustible fecundity of Dao:&nbsp;&ldquo;All things under
heaven are born of being (<em>you</em>); being is born of
<em>wu</em>&rdquo; (ch. 40). What does this mean?</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in the <em>Laozi</em>, Dao is said to be the
&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; of all things (chs. 1, 25). Daoist creation
involves a process of differentiation from unity to multiplicity:
&ldquo;Dao gives birth to One; One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth
to Three; Three gives birth to the ten thousand things&rdquo; (ch.
42). The text does not indicate tense or spell out what the numbers
refer to&mdash;is it saying that something called the
&ldquo;One&rdquo; produced or produces the &ldquo;Two&rdquo; in the
sense of two other things?</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo; of Dao helps impose certain constraints
on interpretation. Specifically, the idea of a creator god with
attributes, like the &ldquo;Lord on High&rdquo; (Shangdi) in ancient
Chinese religion, does not seem to fit with the emphasis on
transcendence.</p>

<p>
The dominant interpretation in traditional China is that Dao
represents the source of the original, undifferentiated, essential
<em>qi</em>-energy, the &ldquo;One,&rdquo; which in turn produces the
yin and yang cosmic forces. While the &ldquo;lighter,&rdquo; more
rarefied yang energy-stuff rises to form heaven, the
&ldquo;heavier&rdquo; yin solidifies to become earth. A further
&ldquo;blending&rdquo; of the two generates a &ldquo;harmonious&rdquo;
<em>qi</em>-energy that informs human beings.</p>

<p>
This is essentially the reading of the Heshang Gong commentary.
Although the <em>Laozi</em> may not have entertained a fully developed
yin-yang cosmological theory, which took shape during the Han period,
it does suggest at one point that natural phenomena are constituted by
yin and yang: the &ldquo;ten thousand things&rdquo; or myriad
creatures, as it rather lyrically puts it, &ldquo;carry yin on their
backs and embrace yang with their arms&rdquo; (ch. 42). That which
gave rise to the original <em>qi</em>-energy, however, is
indescribable. The <em>Laozi</em> calls it Dao, or perhaps more
appropriately in this context, &ldquo;the Dao,&rdquo; with the
definite article, to signal its presence as the source of the created
order.</p>

<p>
In modern terms, minus the language of yin-yang cosmology, this
translates into an understanding of the Dao as &ldquo;an absolute
entity which is the source of the universe,&rdquo; as the <em>Oxford
English Dictionary</em> (online edition, under &ldquo;Tao&rdquo;)
defines it. Again, not being anything in particular, the Dao may be
described as&nbsp;&ldquo;nothing,&rdquo;&nbsp;but on this reading,
<em>wu</em> does not mean &ldquo;nothingness,&rdquo;
&ldquo;negativity&rdquo; or absence in the nihilistic sense, in view
of the creative power of the Dao.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, one could argue that Dao signifies a conceptually
necessary ontological ground; it does not refer to any indescribable
original substance or energy. &ldquo;Beginning&rdquo; is not a term of
temporal reference but suggests ontological priority in the
<em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
The process of creation does proceed from unity to multiplicity, but
the <em>Laozi</em> is only concerned to show that &ldquo;two&rdquo;
would be impossible without the idea of &ldquo;one.&rdquo; The
assertion in <em>Laozi</em> 42, &ldquo;One gives birth to Two,&rdquo;
affirms that duality presupposes unity, but&nbsp;to render it as
&ldquo;The One gave birth to the Two&rdquo; is to turn what is
essentially a logical relation into a cosmogonic&nbsp;event.</p>

<p>
As the source of being, Dao cannot be itself a being, no matter how
powerful or perfect; otherwise, it, too, would be bound by the
limits&nbsp;of finitude.&nbsp;For this reason, the <em>Laozi</em>
makes use of the concept of <em>wu</em>, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; or
&ldquo;nonbeing,&rdquo; not to suggest a substance or something of
which nothing can be said, but to signify the conceptual
&ldquo;otherness&rdquo; and radical transcendence of the ground of
being.</p>

<p>
This agrees with Wang Bi&rsquo;s interpretation. If <em>wu</em> points
to a necessary ontological foundation, the distinction between
&ldquo;Dao&rdquo; and &ldquo;One&rdquo; seems redundant. Commenting on
chapter 42 of the <em>Laozi</em>, Wang Bi writes, &ldquo;One can be
said to be <em>wu.</em>&rdquo; Elsewhere, Wang Bi
explains,&nbsp;&ldquo;One is the beginning of numbers and the ultimate
of things&rdquo; (commentary on ch. 39; see also Wang&rsquo;s
commentary on the <em>Yijing</em>, trans. in Lynn 1994, 60). The
concept of &ldquo;One&rdquo; and the concept of <em>wu</em> thus
complement each other&nbsp;in disclosing, from different
perspectives,&nbsp;that unity and&nbsp;nonbeing are both necessary
to&nbsp;understanding the generation of beings.</p>

<p>
Comparing the two interpretations, both must explain why
the&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;describes (the) Dao
as&nbsp;<em>wu</em>.&nbsp;Whereas the first, the Heshang Gong
reading,&nbsp;focuses on&nbsp;the pervasive presence and infinite
power of the Dao, which on account of its limitlessness and
unfathomability may therefore&nbsp;be described
as&nbsp;<em>wu</em>,&nbsp;the second, aligned with Wang Bi&rsquo;s,
emphasizes the centrality&nbsp;of &ldquo;nonbeing,&rdquo; for which
&ldquo;Dao&rdquo; is but one possible designation, expressive as it
may be.&nbsp;For the latter,&nbsp;&ldquo;Dao&rdquo;&nbsp;is entirely
conceptual and interpreting it as&nbsp;&ldquo;the
Dao&rdquo;&nbsp;would misconstrue it for some mysterious substance,
whereas the former envisages &ldquo;the Dao&rdquo;&nbsp;as referring
to an indescribably vast, pure, and potent&nbsp;<em>qi</em>-energy
that brings about the cosmos and continues to sustain and regulate it.
Depending on the interpretation, <em>wu</em> may be translated as
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;nonbeing&rdquo; accordingly. The
latter may be awkward, but it serves to alert the reader that the
nothingness or emptiness of Dao may not be understood referentially or
reduced simply to the fullness of <em>qi</em>.</p>

<p>
In light of the interest in cosmology during the Warring States
period, the Heshang Gong&nbsp;reading may be privileged, but the
<em>Laozi</em> is also open to an ontological interpretation. Both are
hermeneutically&nbsp;compelling. The ontological reading may
accommodate a&nbsp;<em>qi</em>-based yin-yang cosmology as part of the
natural order of things, although there is significant divergence in
the interpretation of the ethics of the <em>Laozi</em>, as we shall
see in the next section. In either case, the metaphor of
&ldquo;Dao&rdquo; is apt. It shows that all things are derived
ultimately from an absolute &ldquo;beginning,&rdquo; in either sense
of the word, like the start of a pathway. It also suggests a direction
to be followed, which brings out the ethical interest of the
<em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
The <em>Daodejing</em> is concerned with both Dao and <em>de</em>. The
graph <em>de</em> has also made it into the <em>Oxford English
Dictionary</em>: &ldquo;In Taoism, the essence of Tao inherent in all
beings&rdquo;; &ldquo;in Confucianism and in extended use, moral
virtue.&rdquo; <em>De</em> has been translated variously as virtue,
potency, efficacy, integrity, or power (for an etymological study, see
Nivison 1978&ndash;79, and Hall and Ames 1987, 216).</p>

<p>
Like Dao, <em>de</em> is a general concept open to diverse
interpretation. The Confucian understanding of <em>de</em> is by no
means uniform (A. Chan 2011). While some early Ru scholars emphasize
in their interpretation of &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; the roles and
responsibilities embedded in the network of kinship ties and
sociopolitical relationships that constitute the ethical realm, others
focus on the formation of individual moral character through
self-cultivation. Confucius may have emphasized the latter, but there
is ample evidence in the <em>Analects</em> and other Confucian works
testifying to the importance of the former as well. The <em>Laozi</em>
seems to be suggesting a &ldquo;higher&rdquo; <em>de</em> against any
moral achievement attained through repeated effort (e.g., ch.
38).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Admittedly, &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; is ambiguous, and in Latin, as many
scholars have noted, &ldquo;<em>virtus</em>&rdquo; has more to do with
strength and capacity than moral virtues. Nevertheless, there are
advantages to translating <em>de</em> as &ldquo;virtue,&rdquo; as it
keeps in the foreground that the <em>Laozi</em> is giving new meaning
to an established concept, as opposed to introducing a new concept not
found in other schools of thought. From this perspective, both Laozi
and Confucius are interpreters of <em>de</em>-virtue.</p>

<p>
The marriage of Dao and <em>de</em> effectively bridges the gap
between transcendence and immanence. Traditional commentaries
beginning with the <em>Hanfeizi</em> often play on the homonymic
relation between <em>de</em> (virtue) and another character&nbsp;also
pronounced <em>de</em>, which means to &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; or
&ldquo;obtain&rdquo; something. <em>De</em> is thus what one has
&ldquo;obtained&rdquo; from (the) Dao, a &ldquo;latent power&rdquo; by
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo; of which any being becomes what it is (Waley
1958, 32). In this sense, the <em>Laozi</em> speaks of <em>de</em> as
that which nourishes all beings (e.g., ch. 51).</p>

<p>
Within these parameters, interpretations of <em>de</em> follow from
the understanding of Dao and <em>wu</em>. On the one hand, for Heshang
Gong and other proponents of the cosmological view, what one has
obtained from the Dao refers specifically to one&rsquo;s <em>qi</em>
endowment, which determines one&rsquo;s physical, intellectual,
affective, moral, and spiritual capacity. Read this way, the title
<em>Daodejing</em> should be translated as the &ldquo;Classic of the
Way and <em>Its</em> Virtue,&rdquo; given that <em>de</em> is
understood to have emanated from the Dao.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, for Wang Bi and others who do not subscribe to a
substantive view of Dao, <em>de</em> represents what is
&ldquo;genuine&rdquo; or &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; (<em>zhen</em>) in
human beings (e.g., see Wang Bi&rsquo;s commentary on <em>Laozi</em>
chs. 3, 5, 16, 51). Because <em>wu</em> does not refer to any
substance or power, what the <em>Laozi</em> means by <em>de</em>, the
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo; that one has &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; from Dao, can
only be understood as what is originally, naturally present in
all&nbsp;beings.</p>

<p>
In either case, the concept of <em>de</em> emerges as a Daoist
response to the question of human nature, which was one of the most
contested issues in early Chinese philosophy. The two readings of the
<em>Laozi</em> outlined here,&nbsp;despite their differences, agree
that it is an inherent <em>de</em> that enables a person to conform to
the way in which Dao operates. &ldquo;Virtue&rdquo; may be corrupted
easily, but when realized, it radiates the full embodiment of the Dao
understood in terms of <em>qi</em> on Heshang Gong&rsquo;s view, or
the flourishing of authenticity on Wang Bi&rsquo;s interpretation. As
such, Dao points to not only the &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; but also
through <em>de</em> the &ldquo;end&rdquo; of all things.</p>

<h2 id="NatNon">7. Naturalness and Nonaction</h2>

<p>
The <em>Laozi</em> makes use of the concept of <em>ziran</em>,
literally what is &ldquo;self (<em>zi</em>) so (<em>ran</em>),&rdquo;
to describe the workings of Dao. As an abstract concept,
<em>ziran</em> gives no specific information, except to say that Dao
is not derived from or &ldquo;modeled&rdquo; (<em>fa</em>) after
anything (ch. 25). However, since &ldquo;heaven and
earth&rdquo;&mdash;interpreted as nature in most modern
studies&mdash;are said to be born of Dao and come to be in virtue of
their <em>de</em>, the <em>Laozi</em> is in effect saying that the
ways of nature reflect the function of Dao.</p>

<p>
As the Heshang Gong commentary sees it, this suggests an understanding
of nature as governed by the operation of
vital&nbsp;<em>qi-</em>energies in an ideal yin-yang system
characterized by harmony and fecundity. As interpreted by Wang Bi, the
<em>Laozi</em> means more generally that there are
&ldquo;principles&rdquo; (<em>li</em>) inherent in nature.</p>

<p>
Human beings are, in turn, born of heaven and earth and so are
&ldquo;modeled&rdquo; after them, either in terms of their
<em>qi</em>-constitution or in the sense that they are governed also
by the same basic principles. Usually translated as
&ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; or &ldquo;spontaneity,&rdquo; <em>ziran</em>
thus builds on the concept of <em>de</em> in suggesting not only that
the power of Dao finds expression in nature, but also at the practical
level a mode of being and way of action in accordance with the ways of
nature.</p>

<p>
Nature in the Daoist sense, it is important to note, does&nbsp;not
exclude the spiritual and the social. The existence of gods and
spirits, which can be understood also as being constituted by
<em>qi</em> energies, was hardly questioned in early China. The
<em>Laozi</em> makes clear that they, too, stem from Dao and form a
part of the order of <em>ziran</em> (e.g., chs. 39, 60).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, nature encompasses not only natural phenomena but also
sociopolitical institutions. The king clearly occupies a central place
in the realm of Dao (chs. 16, 25); the family also should be regarded
as a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; institution (chs. 18, 54). As an ethical
concept, <em>ziran</em> thus extends beyond the personal to the
sociopolitical level. It is worth mentioning that <em>ziran</em>
remains an influential idea today, especially in conceptions of love,
beauty, and one&rsquo;s attitude toward life and death in Chinese
culture.</p>

<p>
The concept of <em>wuwei</em>, &ldquo;nonaction,&rdquo; serves to
explain naturalness in practice. Like &ldquo;nonbeing,&rdquo;
&ldquo;nonaction&rdquo; is awkward, and some translators have opted
for&nbsp;&ldquo;non-assertive action,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-coercive
action&rdquo; or &ldquo;effortless action,&rdquo;&nbsp;but it
identifies <em>wuwei</em> as a technical term. For this reason, I
prefer &ldquo;nonaction,&rdquo; or better still, retaining
<em>wuwei</em> in its transliterated form and explaining what it means
in the <em>Laozi.</em></p>

<p>
<em>Wuwei</em> does not mean total inaction. Later Daoists often
emphasize the close connection between <em>wuwei</em> and techniques
of spiritual cultivation&mdash;the practice of &ldquo;sitting in
forgetfulness&rdquo; (<em>zuowang</em>) and &ldquo;fasting of the
mind&rdquo; (<em>xinzhai</em>) discussed in the <em>Zhuangzi</em> are
singled out as prime examples in this regard. In the <em>Laozi</em>,
while meditation and other forms of spiritual practice may be
envisaged, the concept of <em>wuwei</em> seems to be used more broadly
as a contrast against any form of action driven&nbsp;by self-serving
desire (e.g., chs. 3, 37). This is where commentarial
intervention&nbsp;must come in, to bring out the full meaning of
nonaction.</p>

<p>
It is useful to recall the late Zhou context, where disorder marched
on every front. The <em>Laozi</em>, one assumes, is not indifferent to
the forces of disintegration tearing the country asunder, although the
remedy it proposes is subject to interpretation. The problems of
political decline are broadly&nbsp;traced to excessive desire, a
violation of <em>ziran</em>. Naturalness encompasses basic human
needs, but these are to be distinguished from desire that fuels and
inflates self-gratification, which knows no end. Nonaction thus
entails at the personal level simplicity and quietude, which naturally
follow from having few desires.</p>

<p>
At the political level, the <em>Laozi</em> condemns aggressive
measures such as war (ch. 30), cruel punishment (ch. 74), and heavy
taxation (ch. 75), which reflect but the ruler&rsquo;s own desire for
wealth and power. If the ruler could rid himself of desire, the
<em>Laozi</em> boldly declares, the world would be at peace of its own
accord (chs. 37, 57).</p>

<p>
In this sense, the <em>Laozi</em> describes the ideal sage-ruler as
someone who understands and follows <em>ziran</em> (e.g., chs. 2, 17,
64). In this same sense, it also opposes the Confucian program of
benevolent intervention, which addresses at best the symptoms but not
the root cause of the disease. The Confucian project is in fact
symptomatic of the decline of the rule of Dao. Conscious efforts at
cultivating moral virtues only accentuate the loss of natural
goodness, which in its original state would have been entirely
commonplace and would not have warranted distinction or special
attention (chs. 18, 38). Worse, Confucian ethics assumes that learning
and moral self-cultivation can bring about personal and social
improvement. From the Daoist perspective, artificial effort to
&ldquo;change&rdquo; people, &ldquo;improve&rdquo; things or to
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; the order of <em>ziran</em> only perpetuates a
false sense of self that alienates human beings from their inherent
&ldquo;virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The concept of nonaction is exceedingly rich. It brings into play a
cutting discernment that value distinctions are ideological, that
human striving and competitive&nbsp;strife spring from the same
source. Nonaction entails also a critique of language and conventional
knowledge, which to the Daoist sage has become impregnated with
ideological contaminants.</p>

<p>
The use of paradoxes in the <em>Laozi</em> especially heightens this
point. For example, the person of Dao is depicted as
&ldquo;witless&rdquo; or &ldquo;dumb,&rdquo; whereas people driven by
desire appear intelligent and can scheme with cunning (ch. 20). The
way of learning, as one would normally understand it,
&ldquo;increases&rdquo; the store of knowledge and adds value to goods
and services; in contrast, questioning the very meaning of such
knowledge and value, the <em>Laozi</em> describes the pursuit of Dao
as constantly &ldquo;decreasing&rdquo; or chipping away at the
artifice built by desire (ch. 48).</p>

<p>
Driving home the same point, to cite but one more example, the
<em>Laozi</em> states, &ldquo;The highest virtue is not virtuous;
therefore it has virtue&rdquo; (ch. 38). In other words, those who
fully realize &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; in the Daoist sense do not act in
the way that men and women of conventional morality typically act or
are expected to act. Paradoxes of this kind function as a powerful
rhetorical device, which forces the readers, so to speak, to move out
of their &ldquo;comfort zone,&rdquo; to wake up from their dogmatic
slumber, and to take note of the proposed higher truth of Dao (see
also, e.g., chs. 41, 45, 56). In this context, one can also understand
some of the provocative statements in the <em>Laozi</em> telling the
ruler, for example, to keep the people in a state of
&ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; (ch. 65).</p>

<p>
Some scholars would object that this interpretation misses the
religious import of the <em>Daodejing</em>, while others would
question whether it is too eager to defend the philosophical coherence
of the classic. Perhaps the <em>Laozi</em> in chapter 65 of the
current text did mean to tell the ruler literally to keep the people
ignorant or stupid for better control, which as a piece of political
advice is not exactly extraordinary. There is also a suspicion that
some&nbsp;kind of relativism may be at play. These issues need to be
further delineated. The remarks offered here take nonaction as central
to the Daoist view of life, recognizing that the concept of
<em>wuwei</em> does not only initiate a critique of value but also
points to a higher mode of knowledge, action, and being.</p>

<p>
The&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;critically establishes the relativity of
knowledge and value. Things appear big or small, for example, only in
relation to other things; knowledge and ignorance are meaningful only
in relation to each other. Good and bad, being and nonbeing, and other
opposites should be understood in the same light (ch. 2).</p>

<p>
However, distinctions as such are not necessarily problematic; for
example, an object can be described as rare or difficult to find as
compared with other objects. Problems arise&nbsp;only when rare
objects are deemed more valuable than commonplace objects, when
&ldquo;big&rdquo; is deemed superior to &ldquo;small,&rdquo; or in
general terms when distinctions become a basis for value
discrimination. When certain things or features (e.g., precious
stones, reputation, being slim, skin color) are regarded as
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; or &ldquo;worthy&rdquo;&mdash;i.e.,
desirable&mdash;other things will inevitably be deemed
&ldquo;ugly&rdquo; and &ldquo;unworthy,&rdquo; with serious social,
economic, and political consequences (ch. 3).</p>

<p>
Viewed in this light, the recognition of the relativity of value does
not end in a kind of moral relativism or ethical paralysis. The
<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;also does not appear to be advocating the
obliteration of all distinctions, and by extension civilization as a
whole, in a state of mystical oneness. For example, while there is
some concern that technology may bring a false sense of progress, the
antidote does not lie in a deliberate rejection of technology but
rather in a life of natural simplicity and contentment that stems from
having few desires (ch. 80).</p>

<p>
The deconstruction of conventional beliefs and values crucially opens
the door to deeper reflection on the order of <em>ziran.</em>&nbsp;It
would be a mistake&nbsp;to equate, for example, &ldquo;hardness&rdquo;
with strength and assign a higher value to it over
&ldquo;softness.&rdquo; However, once such value discrimination is
shown to be arbitrary, the <em>Laozi</em> can then make use of
qualities such as softness, weakness or yieldingness (e.g., ch. 78) to
intimate the Daoist way of life as grounded in nonaction. Similarly,
once the nature of Daoist virtue is made clear,&nbsp;the
<em>Laozi</em> can also speak of it as the &ldquo;highest good&rdquo;
(ch. 8) and &ldquo;highest virtue&rdquo; (ch. 38). The reversal of
understanding, far from rendering the message inconsistent,&nbsp;would
have made a strong&nbsp;impact on the&nbsp;audience<em>.</em></p>

<p>
<em>Wuwei</em> ultimately derives its meaning from <em>wu</em>, which
as an ethical orientation privileges &ldquo;not having&rdquo; over the
constant strivings of the mundane world. This constitutes a radical
critique of a world given to the pursuit of wealth and power. More
importantly, in being &ldquo;empty,&rdquo; the person of Dao is shown
to be &ldquo;full&rdquo;; without desire, he or she is able to
rediscover the riches of <em>ziran</em> and finds fulfillment.</p>

<p>
The critique of value demonstrates the way in which desire
(<em>yu</em>) perverts the mind&mdash;<em>xin</em>, literally,
&ldquo;heart,&rdquo; but understood as the seat of both cognition and
affectivity&mdash;and colors our judgment and experience of reality.
Desire is a complex concept pivotal&nbsp;to explicating the
<em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<p>
Fundamentally, desire&nbsp;depicts the movement of the
&ldquo;heart-mind&rdquo; as it is drawn to things it finds agreeable
(e.g., pleasure) or away from those it dislikes (e.g., pain).
Phenomenologically, the mind is always in motion. Calmness or
tranquility of mind does not mean the cessation of all cognitive or
affective functions. Properly understood,&nbsp;it is willful
desire&nbsp;for self-gratification that transgresses the order of
nature, resulting in a plethora of instantiated desires
causing&nbsp;the heart to go wild, as it were, and pulling the mind in
different directions. This is the root cause of the disease that
afflicts the human condition, according to the <em>Laozi</em>.
Nonaction contrasts sharply&nbsp;with the way people typically act in
a world in which the rule of Dao no longer prevails, with profit
motives, calculated steps, expectations, longings, regrets, and other
expressions of desire. Put differently, nonaction would be
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; action in the pristine order of nature, in which
the mind is at peace, free from the incessant stirring of desire.</p>

<p>
The world, of course, has strayed far from that state, which forms the
starting point of the Daoist critique. The concept of
<em>wuwei</em>&nbsp;thus seeks to portray&nbsp;a&nbsp;mode of being
that governs existential engagement at all levels, transforming the
way in which we think, feel, and experience the world. However, it
does not stipulate what one ought to do or ought not to do in
measured&nbsp;ethical conduct, notwithstanding later interpretations
such as that found in the
<em>Xiang</em>&rsquo;<em>er</em>&nbsp;commentary ascribing a set of
moral precepts to the&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em>. Terms such as quietude,
emptiness, and simplicity favored by the <em>Laozi</em> describe a
general ethical orientation rather than specific practices. To be
sure, in following <em>wuwei</em> there are things that a person of
Dao <em>naturally</em> would not do (e.g., wage a war of
aggression).&nbsp;However, philosophically <em>wuwei</em> is not about
not doing certain things (thus, military engagement is not ruled out
entirely&mdash;e.g., see chs. 67, 68, 69), but suggests a
reorientation of perception and value that ideally would bring an end
to the dominance of desire and a return to the order of
<em>ziran</em>.</p>

<p>
The distinction here is worth repeating. As an ethical-spiritual
ideal,&nbsp;<em>wuwei</em>&nbsp;entails that the person&nbsp;who
embodies fully the virtue or power of Dao, i.e., the sage, would be
free from the disquieting movement of desire.&nbsp;This would
naturally find expression in a way of life&nbsp;characterized by not
doing certain things (e.g., binge drinking) or doing less of certain
things (e.g., consumption of alcohol). This is to be distinguished
from the view&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>wuwei</em> prescribes not doing or
doing less of certain things, which&nbsp;would entail
purposeful&nbsp;striving.</p>

<p>
The transformative power of nonaction would ensure not only personal
fulfillment but also sociopolitical order. This seems to weigh against
a strictly mystical reading of the <em>Laozi</em>, if mysticism is
understood to involve&nbsp;a kind of personal union with the Dao
transcending all political interests. The concept of
&ldquo;virtue,&rdquo; whether interpreted in terms of authenticity or
the purity and fullness of <em>qi</em>-energy, depicts a pristine
natural and sociopolitical order in which naturalness and nonaction
are the norm. The ethics of <em>wuwei</em> rests on this insight.</p>

<p>
As a guide to recovering or attaining that ideal, there may be room
for governments&nbsp;to impose conditions that would diminish&nbsp;the
supply and demand&nbsp;of desire, e.g., by not elevating individuals
who are deemed &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; by worldly standards or valuing
goods that are difficult to obtain (ch. 3). However, effective as they
may be,&nbsp;the deeper point remains that the true&nbsp;sage-ruler,
embodying&nbsp;<em>wuwei</em>&nbsp;in his being,&nbsp;would not
have&nbsp;elevated such individuals or valued such goods in the first
place. Similarly, although it may be said that nonaction points to a
state of mind in which one does everything that one does, it is on the
understanding that in that ideal state certain actions simply would
not occur, as the heart-mind would not be aroused and move in their
direction. For example, to argue that there is a qualitatively
different <em>wuwei</em> way of stealing or cheating&nbsp;would not be
meaningful, because such action would not arise in the ideal realm of
naturalness, although it is not difficult&nbsp;to see how such an
interpretation would enter the popular imagination.</p>

<p>
At the political level, according to the Heshang
Gong&nbsp;commentary,&nbsp;the dispensation of <em>qi</em> gives rise
to a pristine hierarchical order in which those who are blessed with a
perfect <em>qi</em> endowment, the rare sages, would govern with
nonaction. It can be assumed that the sages are naturally predisposed
to quietude, whereas the common people are driven by desire in varying
degree. Indeed, at one point, the <em>Laozi</em> seems to distinguish
three different grades of human beings (ch. 41), which on this view
would be the result of their unequal <em>qi</em> endowment. The role
of the sage-ruler, then, would be to guide the people to abide by
simplicity through personal charisma and example, and also as a
natural consequence by means of policies designed to cultivate an
environment in which desire would not run rampant. In the absence of a
true sage-ruler, the <em>Laozi</em> is saying, according to this
interpretation, those in power should emulate the Daoist sage,
cultivate their internal <em>qi</em> energies, and empty their minds
of desire, to restore peace and harmony to the land.</p>

<p>
The reading represented by the Wang Bi commentary can accommodate the
theory that heaven and earth and the &ldquo;ten thousand things&rdquo;
are all constituted by <em>qi</em>. The decisive difference is that on
this account, human beings all share the same essential nature, as
distinguished from their <em>qi</em>-constituted capacities. For
example, some people may be better endowed and therefore could live to
a ripe old age, while others with a poorer endowment may die
prematurely; but this does not detract from the fundamental assertion
that they share the same inherent <em>de</em>, which defines their
nature.</p>

<p>
Sages are not a different kind of being&nbsp;with a radically
different nature; rather, they are individuals who manage to realize
their authentic <em>de</em>-virtue&nbsp;to the full. Unlike the
Heshang Gong interpretation which essentially traces
&ldquo;sagehood&rdquo; to a special inborn sage-nature, the idea of an
authentic ontological core assures the possibility of attaining the
highest virtue. Being one with Dao does not describe any mystical
union with a divine source or sacred power, but reflects a mode of
being that accords with the assumed original nature marked by natural
goodness and the absence of excessive desire. Because the world is in
a state of decline, the <em>Laozi</em> therefore speaks of a
&ldquo;return&rdquo; to Dao, to naturalness and nonaction.</p>

<p>
Regardless of the position one takes, in this general interpretive
framework a number of symbols which both delight and puzzle readers of
the <em>Laozi</em> can be highlighted. Suggestive of its creativity
and nurturance, Dao is likened to a mother (e.g., chs. 1, 25). This
complements the paradigm of the feminine (e.g., chs. 6, 28), whose
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo; is seen to yield fecundity and to find expression
in yieldingness and non-contention. The infant (e.g., chs. 52, 55)
serves as a fitting symbol on two counts. First, it brings out the
relationship between Dao and world; second, the kind of innocence and
wholesome spontaneity represented by the infant exemplifies the
pristine fullness of virtue in the ideal Daoist world.</p>

<p>
Natural symbols such as water (e.g., chs. 8, 78) further reinforce the
sense of yielding and deep strength that characterizes nonaction. The
low-lying and fertile valley (e.g., chs. 28, 39) accentuates both the
creative fecundity of Dao and the gentle nurturance of its power.
Carefully crafted and ornately decorated objects are treasured by the
world, and as such can be used as a powerful symbol for it. In
contrast, the utterly simple, unaffected, and seemingly valueless
<em>pu</em>, a plain uncarved block of wood, brings into sharp relief
the integrity of Daoist virtue and of the person who embodies it
(e.g., chs. 28, 32). Finally, one may mention the notion of reversal
(e.g., chs. 40, 65), which suggests not only the need to
&ldquo;return&rdquo; to Dao, but also that the Daoist way of life
would inevitably appear the very opposite of &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
existence, and that it involves a complete revaluation of values.</p>

<p>
In sum, any interpretation of the current <em>Laozi</em> as a whole
must take into account (a) the &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo; of Dao and
(b) the way in which <em>wuwei</em> and <em>ziran</em> provide a guide
to the good life.</p>

<p>
With respect to the latter, it is true that in many instances&nbsp;the
text seems to be addressing the ruler or the ruling elite, explaining
to them the ideal government of the Daoist sage. This is not
surprising given the Zhou context and given that the production of
written documents and the access to them were generally the preserve
of the ruling class in ancient China. However, this need not restrict
interpretation to politics in the narrow sense of statecraft or
political strategies. In the light of the emphasis on <em>ziran</em>
and <em>wuwei</em>, there is sufficient evidence that the
<em>Laozi</em> views politics in a larger ethical-spiritual context,
in which the flourishing of sociopolitical order is rooted in
self-cultivation.</p>

<p>
In the final analysis, naturalness and nonaction are seen to reflect
the function of the nameless and formless Dao. As such, Daoist ethics
is&nbsp;anchored in an&nbsp;idealized view of nature, characterized by
inherent <em>de</em>-virtue. It is on this basis that the concept of
<em>de</em> is raised to a higher level than &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; in
the sense of moral attainments. Perhaps for this reason, to ensure
that virtue as the power of Dao&nbsp;is properly understood, the
<em>Laozi</em> did not resort to the language of &ldquo;human
nature&rdquo; (<em>xing</em>) commonly employed in early Chinese
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The understanding of <em>de</em>, however, is dependent on that of
Dao, which in turn hinges on the interpretation of <em>wu</em> as
either original substance or nonbeing. Both readings are plausible and
are within the semantic range of the <em>Laozi</em>. Whereas the
former subscribes to the prevalent <em>qi</em> theory that underlies
much of Chinese philosophy and on that basis provides an
integral&nbsp;view of the cosmos, self-cultivation and government, the
latter focuses on the fundamental unity of being characterized by
natural simplicity and quietude that ideally should define the ethical
course for both the individual and society.</p>

<p>
The <em>Laozi</em> should be recognized as a seminal work. It is
profoundly insightful,&nbsp;but it is the task of the interpreter to
work out the full implications of its often provocative insight. It
seems reasonable to assume that while the <em>Laozi</em> has something
new to offer, it nonetheless shares certain background ideas and
assumptions with other early Chinese philosophical works. As such, the
Heshang Gong&nbsp;interpretation should be given due consideration.
However, in bringing into view the nothingness of Dao and the order of
<em>ziran</em>, the <em>Laozi</em> invites reflection on the very core
of being beyond its <em>qi</em>&nbsp;constitution. While the
production of meaning is context dependent, new horizons do emerge
from great works of philosophy. The two lines of interpretation
outlined here have different ethical implications regarding the nature
of the ideal sage, but neither can be said to have transgressed the
hermeneutic boundaries of the <em>Daodejing</em>. The suggestion that
they both arise from the <em>Laozi</em> is not a matter of
equivocation but an acknowledgement of its hermeneutical depth.</p>

<p>
The power of the <em>Daodejing</em> does not lie in a clearly laid out
set of doctrines, but in its seminal insights. The concept of
<em>qi</em> may be culture specific, and the prospects of realizing
universal Daoist order may seem remote, but the recognition of the
fundamental problem of desire should still give us pause. The ills of
discrimination, exploitation and intellectual hubris, so deeply
embedded in language and value systems, remain as serious today as
they were in early China. The healing power of nonaction still strikes
a chord and commands continuing reflection and engagement. Although in
working out these insights differences will no doubt arise, they unite
all interpreters of the <em>Laozi</em> and draw new generations of
readers into the mystery of Dao and (its) virtue.</p>
