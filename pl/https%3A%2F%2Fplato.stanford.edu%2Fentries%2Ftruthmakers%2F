<h1>Truthmakers</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Feb 23, 2013; substantive revision Mon Sep 23, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
This much is agreed: &ldquo;<em>x</em> makes it true that
<em>p</em>&rdquo; is a construction that signifies, if it signifies
anything at all, a relation borne to a truth-bearer by something else,
a truth-maker. But it isn&rsquo;t generally agreed what that something
else might be, or what truth-bearers are, or what the character might
be of the relationship that holds, if it does, between them, or even
whether such a relationship ever does hold. Indeed sometimes
there&rsquo;s barely enough agreement amongst the parties to the
truth-maker dispute for them to be disagreeing about a common subject
matter. This makes navigating the literature about truth-makers a
treacherous undertaking but a necessary one because of the
significance the debate about truth-makers bears for contemporary
metaphysics.</p>

<p>
We can distinguish between the following questions that different
approaches to truth-makers have been framed to answer:</p>

<ol>

<li>What is it to be a truth-maker?</li>

<li>Which range, or ranges, of truths are eligible to be made true (if
any are)?</li>

<li>What kinds of entities are truth-makers?</li>

<li>What is the motivation for adopting a theory of truth-makers?</li>

<li>What are truth-bearers?</li>
</ol>

<p>
These questions cannot be addressed in isolation from one another. Our
thinking about what it is to be a truth-maker will have knock-on
effects for how we answer the second and third questions. Our beliefs
about which truths have truth-makers will likely shape our answer to
the first and third. And the question of what our motivations are for
positing truth-makers in the first place will no doubt exert a
controlling influence upon our responses to the other questions.</p>

<p>
The notion of a truth-maker cannot ultimately be understood in
isolation from the notion of what it makes true, a truth-bearer. This
is understandable: metaphysicians are typically interested in what
there is rather than representations thereof. But truth-bearers are
the elephant in the room during these discussions.We cannot avoid
talking about them because what we think about truth-bearers will have
consequences for what we think about truth-makers. So we cannot
postpone indefinitely answering the fifth question. We&rsquo;ll start
with the issue of what it is to be a truth-maker.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="WhaTruMak">1. What is a Truth-maker?</h2>

<p>
Truth-makers are often introduced in the following terms:</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Virtue-T</em>)</dt>
<dd>a truth-maker is that in virtue of which something is true</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The sense in which a truth-maker &ldquo;makes&rdquo; something true is
said to be different from the causal sense in which, e.g., a potter
makes a pot. It is often added that the primary notion of a
truth-maker is that of a <em>minimal</em> one: a truth-maker for a
truth-bearer <em>p</em> none of whose proper parts or constituents are
truth-makers for <em>p</em>. (Whether every proposition has a minimal
truth-maker is a further matter.) We are also cautioned that even
though people often speak as if there is a unique truth-maker for each
truth, it is usually the case that one truth is made true by many
things (collectively or severally).</p>

<p>
Now whether (<em>Virtue-T</em>) provides a satisfactory elucidation of
truth-making depends on whether we have a clear understanding of
&ldquo;in virtue of&rdquo;. Some argue <em>in virtue of</em> is an
unavoidable primitive whilst others are wary. But even if it is
primitive, we need to understand how the notions of
<em>truthmaking</em> and <em>in virtue of</em> are related to other
concepts we grasp in order to establish their significance for us. So
to show that these are notions of sound theoretical standing it must
be shown that they can at least be elucidated if not analysed in terms
of notions that enjoy a life independently of the circle of notions to
which <em>in virtue of</em> and <em>truth-making</em> belong.</p>

<h3 id="TruMakEnt">1.1 Truth-making as Entailment</h3>

<p>
One proposal for improving upon (<em>Virtue-T</em>) appeals to the
notion of <em>entailment</em> (Fox 1987: 189; Bigelow 1988:
125&ndash;7):</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Entailment-T</em>)</dt>
<dd>a truth-maker is a thing the very existence of which entails that
something is true.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So <em>x</em> is a truth-maker for a truth <em>p</em> iff <em>x</em>
exists and another representation that says <em>x</em> exists entails
the representation that <em>p</em>. It is an attraction of this
principle that the key notion it deploys, namely entailment, is
ubiquitous, unavoidable and enjoys a rich life outside
philosophy&mdash;both in ordinary life and in scientific and
mathematical practice.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately this account threatens to over-generate truth-makers for
necessary truths&mdash;at least if the notion of entailment it employs
is classical. It&rsquo;s a feature of this notion that anything
whatsoever entails a necessary truth <em>p</em>. It follows as a
special case of this that any claim that a given object exists must
entail <em>p</em> too. So it also follows&mdash;if
(<em>Entailment-T</em>) is granted&mdash;that any object makes any
necessary truth true. But this runs counter to the belief that, e.g.,
the leftovers in your refrigerator aren&rsquo;t truth-makers for the
representation that 2+2=4. Even worse, Restall has shown how to
plausibly reason from (<em>Entailment-T</em>) to &ldquo;truth-maker
monism&rdquo;: the doctrine that every truth-maker makes every truth
true (whether necessary or contingent). Every claim of the form
<em>p</em> &or; ~<em>p</em> is a necessary truth. So every existing
thing <em>s</em> is a truth-maker for each instance of this form (see
preceding paragraph). Now let <em>p</em> be some arbitrary truth
(grass is green) and <em>s</em> any truth-maker for <em>p</em> &or;
~<em>p</em> (a particular ice floe in the Antarctic ocean). Now it is
intuitively plausible that something makes a disjunction true
<em>either</em> by making one disjunct true <em>or</em> by making the
other disjunct true (Mulligan, Simons, &amp; Smith 1984: 316). This is
what Restall calls &ldquo;the disjunction thesis&rdquo;. It follows
from this thesis that either <em>s</em> makes <em>p</em> true or
<em>s</em> makes ~<em>p</em> true. Given that <em>p</em> is true,
neither <em>s</em> nor anything else makes it true that ~<em>p</em>.
So <em>s</em> (the ice floe) must make it true that <em>p</em> (grass
is green)! But since <em>s</em> and <em>p</em> were chosen arbitrarily
it follows that all truth-makers are on a par, making true every truth
(Restall 1996: 333&ndash;4).</p>

<p>
The unacceptability of these results indicates that insofar as we have
an intuitive grip upon the concept of a truth-maker it is constrained
by the requirement that a truth-maker for a truth must be relevant to
or about what it represents as being the case. For example, the truths
of pure arithmetic are not about what&rsquo;s at the back of your
refrigerator; what&rsquo;s there isn&rsquo;t relevant to their being
true. So we&rsquo;re constrained to judge that what&rsquo;s there
cannot be truth-makers for them. This suggests that operating at the
back of our minds when we issue these snap judgements there must be
something like the principle:</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Relevance</em>)</dt>
<dd>what makes something true must&mdash;<em>in some
sense</em>&mdash;be what it is &ldquo;about&rdquo;.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Of course the notions of &ldquo;about&rdquo; and
&ldquo;relevance&rdquo; are notoriously difficult to pin down (Goodman
1961). And a speaker can know something is true without knowing
everything about what makes it true. Often it will require empirical
research to settle what makes a statement true. Moreover, what is
determined <em>a posteriori</em> to be a truth-maker may exhibit a
complexity quite different from that of the statement it makes true
(Mulligan, Simons, &amp; Smith 1984: 299). Nevertheless, it is clear
that unless (<em>Entailment-T</em>) is constrained in some way it will
generate truth-makers that are unwanted because their presence
conflicts with (<em>Relevance</em>).</p>

<p>
One way to restore accord between them would be to abandon the
Disjunction Thesis that together with (<em>Entailment-T</em>) led us
down the path to Truth-maker Monism. Indeed isn&rsquo;t the
Disjunction Thesis dubious anyway? Consider examples involving the
open future. Can&rsquo;t we imagine a situation arising that makes it
true that one or other of the horses competing in a race will win, but
which neither makes it true that one of the horses in particular will
win nor makes it true that another will (Read 2000; Restall 2009)? For
further discussion of issues surrounding truthmaking entailment, the
Disjunctive Thesis and the Conjunctive Thesis, i.e. the principle that
a truthmaker for a conjunction is a truthmaker for its conjuncts, see
Rodriguez-Pereyra 2006a, 2009, Jago 2009, Lopez de Sa 2009 and
Talasiewicz (et al) (2012) and Briggs 2012.</p>

<p>
But even if the Disjunction Thesis is given up still this leaves in
place the embarrassing consequence of defining what it is to be a
truth-maker in terms of classical entailment, <em>viz</em>. that
<em>any</em> existing thing turns out to be a truth-maker for
<em>any</em> necessary truth. Some more radical overhaul of
(<em>Entailment-T</em>) is needed to avoid over-generation. One
possibility is to redefine what is to be a truth-maker in terms of a
more restrictive notion of &ldquo;relevant entailment&rdquo; (in the
tradition of Anderson &amp; Belnap) that requires what is entailed to
be relevant to what it is entailed by (Restall 1996, 2000; Armstrong
2004: 10&ndash;12, Simons 2008: 13).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless since truth-making concerns the bestowal of truth,
entailment its preservation, there must <em>at some level</em> be an
important connection to be made out between truth-making and
entailment; the effort expended to make out such a connection will be
effort spent to the advantage of metaphysicians and logicians alike.
But even granted this is so there are reasons to be doubtful that any
overhaul of (<em>Entailment-T</em>), however radical, will capture
what it is to be a truth-maker. One vital motivation for believing in
truth-makers is this. Positing truth-makers enables us to make sense
of the fact that the truth of something depends on how things stand
with an independently given reality. Truth-makers are posited to
provide the point of semantic contact whereby true representations
touch upon an independent reality, upon something
non-representational. Since entailment is a relation between
representations it follows that the notion of a truth-maker cannot be
fully explicated in terms of the relation of
entailment&mdash;regardless of whether representations are best
understood as sentences or propositions or some other candidate
truth-bearer (Heil 2000: 233&ndash;4; 2003: 62&ndash;5; Merricks 2007:
12&ndash;13). Ultimately (<em>Entailment-T</em>), or a relevance logic
version if it, will leave us wanting an account of what makes a
representation of the existence of a truth-maker&mdash;whatever it
entails&mdash;itself beholden to an independent reality.</p>

<h3 id="TruMakNec">1.2 Truth-making as Necessitation</h3>

<p>
Appreciating that truthmaking cannot be entailment, Armstrong made a
bold maneuver. He posited a primitive relation of metaphysical
necessitation (1997: 151, 2004: 96)). The relation in question lights
upon a portion of reality at one end and upon a truth at the other.
Armstrong then defined what is to be a truth-maker in terms of this
metaphysical bridging relation which relates portions of the world to
truthbearers.</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Necessitation-T</em>)</dt>
<dd>a truth-maker is a thing that necessitates something&rsquo;s being
true.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In the simplest case that means that the truth making relation is one
that &ldquo;holds between any truthmaker, <em>T</em>, which is
something in the world, and the proposition&rdquo; that <em>T</em>
exists (2004: 6). This conception of truth making avoids the
&ldquo;category&rdquo; mistake that results from attempting to define
truth-making in terms of entailment. It also makes some advance upon
(<em>Virtue-T</em>) and its primitive use of &ldquo;in virtue
of&rdquo; because at least (<em>Necessitation-T</em>) relates the
notion of truth making to other modal notions, like that of necessity,
upon which we have some independent handle.</p>

<p>
But what is there to be said in favour of conceiving of truth-makers
in terms of &ldquo;necessitation&rdquo;? Armstrong offers the
following argument. Suppose that <em>T</em> is a candidate truth-maker
for a truth <em>p</em> even though <em>T</em> fails to necessitate
<em>p</em>. Then it is possible for <em>T</em> to exist even when
<em>p</em> is false. Armstrong now reflects &ldquo;we will surely
think that the alleged truth-maker was insufficient by itself and
requires to be supplemented in some way&rdquo; (1997: 116). Suppose
this supplementary condition is the existence of another entity,
<em>U</em>. Then &ldquo;<em>T</em>+<em>U</em> would appear to be the
true and necessitating truth-maker for <em>p</em>&rdquo; (2004: 7).
Armstrong concludes that a truth-maker for a truth must necessitate
the truth in question.</p>

<p>
This argument takes us nowhere except around in a circle.
(<em>Necessitation-T</em>) embodies the doctrine that it is both
necessary and sufficient for being a truth-maker that a thing
necessitates the truth it makes true. Armstrong&rsquo;s argument for
this doctrine relies upon the dual assumptions: (1) anything that
fails to necessitate <em>p</em> (witness <em>T</em>) cannot be a
truth-maker for <em>p</em>,whereas (2) anything that succeeds in
necessitating <em>p</em> (witness <em>T</em>+<em>U</em>) must be. But
(1) just is the claim that it is necessary, and (2) just the claim
that it is sufficient for being a truth-maker that a thing
necessitates the truth it makes true. Since it relies upon (1) and
(2), and (1) and (2) are just equivalent to
(<em>Necessitation-T</em>), it follows that Armstrong&rsquo;s argument
is incapable of providing independent support for the conception he
favours of what it is to be a truth-maker.</p>

<p>
Even though this argument is circular, does (<em>Necessitation-T</em>)
at least have the favourable feature that adopting it enables us to
avoid the other difficulty that beset (<em>Entailment-T</em>),
<em>viz</em>. over-generation? Not if there are things that
necessitate a truth whilst still failing to be sufficiently relevant
to be plausible truth-makers for it. If the necessitation relation is
so distributed that it holds between any contingently existing portion
of reality, e.g., an ice-floe, and any necessary truth, e.g., 2+2=4,
then we shall be no further forward than we were before. So Armstrong
needs to tell us more about the cross-categorial relation in question
to assure us that such cases cannot arise.</p>

<p>
Smith suggests another problem case for
(<em>Necessitarian-T</em>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that God wills that John kiss Mary now. God&rsquo;s willing
act thereby necessitates the truth of &ldquo;John is kissing
Mary&rdquo;. (For Malebranche, all necessitation is of this sort.) But
God&rsquo;s act is not a truth-maker for this judgement. (Smith 1999:
6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If such cases are possible then (<em>Necessitation-T</em>) fails to
provide a sufficient condition for being a truth-maker.</p>

<p>
Smith endeavours to avoid such failures of sufficiency by appealing to
a notion of <em>projection</em>, where the projection of a
truth-bearer is, roughly speaking, the subject matter of the
truth-bearer, what it is &lsquo;about&rsquo;. Then a truthmaker for a
truth bearer <em>p</em> can be defined as something that necessitates
<em>p</em> and falls within the projection of <em>p</em> (Smith 1999).
For this solution to be effective we need to be given criteria for the
notion of projection which ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t also lead to
an overgeneration of truthmakers. But it&rsquo;s questionable whether
this can be done without drawing on further notions that aren&rsquo;t
obviously clearer than truthmaking itself. (See Gregory 2001, Smith
2002 and Schnieder 2006b and Schipper 2020 for a related account of
truthmaking in terms of &lsquo;aboutness&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
Asay responds to failures of sufficiency by biting the bullet. Asay
holds (2023: 8; 2020: 51) that an entity <em>e</em>&rsquo;s
necessitating the truth of a sentence <em>s</em> is necessary and
sufficient for <em>e</em> to be a truthmaker of <em>s</em>. His
response to apparent counterexamples, e.g., an ice floe&rsquo;s making
it true that 2+2=4, is to bite the bullet: these are genuine case of
truthmaking (2020: 234). He argues that any impression to the contrary
overlooks (1) the fact that &lsquo;&ldquo;truthmaking&rdquo; is a term
of art, employed for a certain theoretical purpose within
metaphysics&rsquo; viz. &lsquo;developing a proper harmony
between&rsquo; truth and reality (2023: 8). And (2) that mathematics
consists of &lsquo;trivial truths&rsquo; &ndash; in fact, Asay claims,
mathematical truths are analytic--and that numbers and functions are
only &lsquo;trivial objects&rsquo; whose significance for ontology is
exhausted by their being truthmakers for &lsquo;trivial truth&rsquo;
(2020: 234). Asay&rsquo;s responses invite the following
rejoinders.</p>

<p>
First: Asay&rsquo;s attempt to dispel the counterexamples by claiming
that &ldquo;truthmaking&rdquo; is a term of art, employed for a
certain theoretical purpose within metaphysics&rsquo; is undermined by
his own practice. He introduces the notion of truthmaking in a very
informal fashion (2023: 2&ndash;3): he runs a thought experiment in
which you exercise god-like powers of creating things while one
bureaucracy keeps record of the increasing ontology and another keeps
record of which sentences are made true. The theoretical purpose of
truthmaking cannot be arcane if it can be illustrated by such a simple
if fanciful hypothetical example. (Note too that, by following
Asay&rsquo;s lead, we could block any counterexample to any cherished
philosophical theory that used some term t simply by declaring that
our theory used t as a term of art to further some theoretical
purpose.) Second: the claim that mathematics is, in general, analytic
or trivial is a deeply controversial doctrine. So insofar as a theory
of truthmakers relies upon the view that mathematics is analytic that
raises a question about the tenability of that theory of
truthmakers.</p>

<p>
Returning to (<em>Necessitarian-T</em>) there is a further objection
that bears on the question of truth-bearers. Armstrong conceives the
necessitation relation it uses as internal: &ldquo;An internal
relation is one where the existence of the terms entails the existence
of the relation&rdquo;; otherwise a relation is external (Armstrong
1997: 87). Armstrong argues that the relation of truth-making has to
be internal (in this sense) because if it weren&rsquo;t then we would
have to allow that, absurdly, &ldquo;anything may be a truth-maker for
any truth&rdquo; (1997: 198). But then nothing but
propositions&mdash;conceived in the self-interpreting sense&mdash;can
be truth-bearers that are internally related to their truth-makers.
Any other candidate for this representational role&mdash;a token
belief state or utterance&mdash;could have been endowed with a
different representational significance than the one it possesses. So
the other eligible candidates, by contrast to propositions,
aren&rsquo;t internally related to what makes them true.</p>

<p>
Armstrong&rsquo;s commitment to the truth-making relation&rsquo;s
being internal clashes with his naturalism (David 2005: 156&ndash;9).
According to Armstrong,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Truth attaches in the first place to propositions, those propositions
which have a truth-maker. But no Naturalist can be happy with a realm
of propositions. (1997: 131)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So Armstrong counsels that we don&rsquo;t take propositions with
&ldquo;ontological seriousness&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What exists are classes of intentionally equivalent tokens. The
<em>fundamental</em> correspondence, therefore, is not between
entities called truths and their truth-makers, but between the token
beliefs and thoughts, on the one hand, and truth-makers on the other.
(1997: 131)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But naturalistically kosher token beliefs and thoughts aren&rsquo;t
internally related to what makes them true. So Armstrong&rsquo;s
naturalism commits him to denying that the truth-making relation is
internal after all. Heil has also inveighed in a naturalistic spirit
against incurring a commitment to propositions that are designed to
have their own &ldquo;built-in intentionality&rdquo; whilst continuing
to maintain that truth-making is an internal relation (2006:
240&ndash;3). Since we have no idea of what a naturalistic
representation would look like that was internally related to what
made it true, this appears to be an impossible combination of views.
Our inability to conjure up a credible class of truth-bearers that are
internally related to their truth-makers provides us with a very
strong incentive for supposing that the truth-making relation is
external. The long and short of it: if we are wary, as many
naturalists are, of the doctrine that truth-bearers are propositions,
then we should also be wary of thinking that the truth-making relation
is internal. This spells trouble for (<em>Necessitarian-T</em>) and
any other account of truth making which invoke internal relations to
propositions.</p>

<p>
As an alternative to account of truthmaking in terms of necessitation,
Mulligan and Lowe have suggested that truth-maker of a proposition is
something such that it is part of the essence of that proposition that
it is true if that thing exists. (Mulligan 2003: 547, 2006: 39, 2007;
Lowe 2006: 203&ndash;10, 2009: 209&ndash;15. ). Lowe suggests that
helps rules out spurious case of truth making--because it isn&rsquo;t
part of the essence of the proposition that John is kissing Mary that
it is true if there exists an act of God&rsquo;s willing it, or part
of the essence of the proposition that 2+2=4 that it is true if there
is a particular ice floe in the Antarctic, or part of the essence of
the proposition that 2+2=4 that it is true if &pi; exists (2006:
202&ndash;3). But, on the downside, it may be questioned whether our
grip upon the notion of the essence of a proposition is any firmer
than the notion of truth-maker for it and since relation of a
proposition to its truthmakers is internal, the essentialist approach
inherits the difficulties of (<em>Necessitatian-T</em>).</p>

<h3 id="AxiTruMak">1.3 Axiomatic Truth-making</h3>

<p>
All this might be taken to show that the project of defining
truth-making in more basic terms is misconceived, much as the project
of defining knowledge in more basic terms has come to seem
misconceived because e.g., of the Gettier cases. Of course
there&rsquo;s no gain to be had from, doing nothing more than
declaring the notion of a truth-maker to be primitive. If it&rsquo;s
primitive then we also need to know how the notion may be fruitfully
applied in association with other concepts we already
deploy&mdash;entailment, existence, truth, etc. &mdash;to describe the
interplay of truth-bearers and the world. As Simons remarks,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The signs are that truth-making is not analysable in terms of anything
more primitive, but we need to be able to say more than just that. So
we ought to consider it as specified by principles of truth-making.
(2000: 20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, the notion needs to be introduced non-reductively but
still informatively and this is to be achieved by appealing to its
systematic liaisons with other concepts.</p>

<p>
This is the approach of Mulligan, Simons and Smith&rsquo;s 1984:
312&ndash;8. The principal schemata they employed to convey an
articulate grasp of what <em>truth-making</em> means in non-reductive
terms included:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em-right">
<dt>(i)</dt>
<dd>(Factive) If <em>A</em> makes it true that <em>p</em>, then
<em>p</em></dd>
<dt>(ii)</dt>
<dd>(Existence) If <em>A</em> exists, then <em>A</em> makes it true
that <em>A</em> exists</dd>
<dt>(iii)</dt>
<dd>(Entailment) If <em>A</em> makes it true that <em>p</em>, and that
<em>p</em> entails that <em>q</em>, then <em>A</em> makes it true that
<em>q</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Each of these schemata specifies a definite linkage between the
application of the notion of <em>truth-making</em> and some other
condition. <em>Truth-making</em> is introduced as the notion that
sustains all of these linkages. Putting the schemata together what it
is to be a truth-maker is then definable intra-theoretically as
follows,</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Axiomatic-T</em>)</dt>
<dd>A truth-maker is something <em>x</em> such that (i) if <em>x</em>
makes it true that <em>p</em> then <em>p</em>, (ii) if <em>x</em>
exists then <em>x</em> makes it true that <em>x</em> exists&hellip;
and so on for each of the axiom schemata of our favoured theory of
truth-makers.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is important to appreciate that adopting this approach to
truth-making doesn&rsquo;t have the benefits of theft over honest
toil. For one thing it doesn&rsquo;t obviate the threat of superfluous
truth-makers for necessary truths. (<em>Entailment</em>) is the
principle that truth-making tracks entailment: if <em>A</em> makes
<em>p</em> true then it makes all the consequences of <em>p</em> true
too. It&rsquo;s a principle that recommends itself irrespective of
whether truth-making can be defined. This is because it dovetails
smoothly with the idea that one truth-maker can make many truths true.
For example, suppose that a particular <em>a</em> has some absolutely
determinate mass. It is entailed by this description that various
determinable descriptions are also truly predicable of <em>a</em>.
Some of these truths say more than others, nonetheless they all have
the same truth-maker. Why so? Because they are entailed by
<em>a</em>&rsquo;s having the mass it does (Armstrong 1997: 130; 2004:
10&ndash;11). To answer so is to appeal to (<em>Entailment</em>). But
if the entailment that truth-making tracks is classical then we are
back to flouting (<em>Relevance</em>). If <em>q</em> is necessary then
any contingent <em>p</em> classically entails <em>q</em>. So if
something at the back of your refrigerator makes it true that
<em>p</em> then by (<em>Entailment</em>) it makes <em>q</em> true too.
To avoid flouting (<em>Relevance</em>) in this way
(<em>Entailment</em>) had better be a principle that links
truth-making to a more restrictive, non-classical notion of entailment
(Mulligan, Simons, &amp; Smith 1984: 316).</p>

<p>
So adopting the Axiomatic approach won&rsquo;t save us the labour of
figuring out which non-classical connective it is that contributes to
capturing what it is to be a truth-maker. Nor will appealing to
(<em>Axiomatic-T</em>) save us the hard work of figuring out what
truth-makers and truth-bearers must be like in order to collectively
realise the structure described by the axiom schemata for truth-makers
we favour. But, on the other hand, there is nothing about these
schemata that demands truth-bearer and truth-maker be internally
related.</p>

<p>
The Axiomatic approach to truth-making has proved less attention than
other more metaphysically-loaded conceptions, in terms of
necessitation, essence or grounding. But an attraction of the
Axiomatic approach is its metaphysical neutrality. .</p>

<h3 id="TruMakGro">1.4 Truth-Making as Grounding</h3>

<p>
Can truth-making be defined in terms of <em>grounding</em> or what is
sometimes described as non-causal <em>metaphysical</em> dependence?
The notion of truth-making is typically introduced, as we have seen,
in terms of the ideology of &ldquo;in virtue of&rdquo;. As we have
also seen, many philosophers then ask: but what independent content
can be given to this notion? In response to this challenge, a theory
of grounding may be conceived as a general theory of &ldquo;in virtue
of&rdquo; in terms of which truth-making may then be explained. A
further consideration which motivates those already committed to
grounding is the general methodological principle that favours
theoretical unification. Their idea is that by conceiving of
truth-making as a kind of grounding, we are able to understand
truth-making better, i.e. not as an isolated phenomenon but as an
instance of a more general pattern, thereby illuminating not only the
nature of truth-making but grounding too.</p>

<p>
How truthmaking is to be defined in terms of grounding depends upon
how non-causal dependence is logically conceived, either as a
predicate (&lsquo;grounds&rsquo;) or a non-causal operator
(&lsquo;because&rsquo;). Consider the following alternatives:</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt><em>(Grounding-Predicate-T)</em></dt>
<dd>A truth-maker is an entity <em>x</em> which makes a proposition
<em>y</em> true iff the fact that <em>x</em> exists grounds the fact
that <em>y</em> is true.</dd>
<dt><em>(Grounding-Operator-T)</em></dt>
<dd>A truth-maker is an entity <em>x</em> which makes a proposition
<em>y</em> true iff <em>y</em> is true because <em>x</em> exists.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(For the former, see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005, Schaffer 2009, Jago 2018:
184&ndash;202, for the latter, Correia 2005, 2014, Schnieder 2006a,
Mulligan 2007, Caputo 2007).</p>

<p>
One attraction of conceiving truth-making as based on grounding arises
from taking grounding to be &ldquo;hyperintensional&rdquo;. Grounding
is intended to be a notion that&rsquo;s fine-grained enough to
distinguish those entities, e.g., the cardinal numbers, that ground a
necessary truth, such as 2+2=4, from those that don&rsquo;t, e.g. a
contingent existent such as the aforementioned ice floe. Because
grounding is so fine-grained, the hope is that neither
<em>Grounding-Predicate-T</em> or <em>Grounding-Operator-T</em> will
give rise to the over-generation that beset <em>Entailment-T</em> and
<em>Necessitation-T</em> but without having to appeal to an
underdeveloped notion of &ldquo;about&rdquo; or
&ldquo;relevance&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Of course, in light of sec, 1.2 and 1.3 above, we can foresee a
downside to this. Both <em>Grounding-Predicate-T</em> and
<em>Grounding-Operator-T</em> quantify over propositions that stand
hyperintensionally to their truth-makers. It follows that both
<em>Grounding-Predicate-T</em> and <em>Grounding-Operator-T</em> share
a commitment with <em>Necessitarian-T</em>, viz. an ontology of
abstract propositions which have their meanings essentially. Suppose
grounding is, <em>eo ipso</em>, an internal or necessitating relation.
Then if the truth of a proposition <em>P</em> is grounded in the
existence of something <em>G</em> then in every world in which both
<em>G</em> and <em>P</em> exists, <em>P</em> is true. Now this
presupposes that <em>P</em> bears the same meaning in every world in
which both <em>P</em> and <em>G</em> exists&mdash;because we
don&rsquo;t want <em>G</em> to make <em>P</em> true if <em>P</em>
meant something different from what it first did. But if propositions
are conceived, say, as sentence tokens, then there can be no guarantee
that the presupposition will be met&mdash;since sentence tokens may be
differently interpreted in different worlds. Of course the guarantee
can be made if propositions are conceived as abstract things which
have their meanings essentially. But this is a theoretical cost of the
proposal. So the grounding theorists must either bear the cost or
provide an alternative account of what propositions are such that they
are hyper-intensionally related to their truthmakers. But, again, this
may be a commitment many grounding theorists have already made or be
willing to accept if it gives them a good account of truth-making.</p>

<p>
So far we have considered efforts to define truth-making in terms of
grounding. But there are other approaches in the literature which seek
to endorse one notion at the expense of the other. One way accepts
grounding as a welcome theoretical innovation but argues that we are
better off without truth-making, at least in the forms which have
become familiar to us. A second way continues to endorse truth-making
whilst rejecting grounding. (Other available positions include: that
truth making is a special kind of grounding which involves a unique
form of dependence (Griffith 2013), that truth making isn&rsquo;t
grounding but that grounding is key to truthmaking (Saenz 2018) and
that grounding obviates the need to appeal to truthmaking (Liggins
2012)).</p>

<p>
The first approach, taken by Fine, involves keeping grounding but
rejecting truth-making because grounding does a better job (Fine 2012;
43&ndash;6). Here truth-making is conceived as a relation between a
worldly entity and a representation where the existence of the entity
guarantees the truth of the representation. But, Fine argues, it is
more theoretically fruitful to take grounding as the central notion
for metaphysics. This is partly because, Fine maintains, grounding is
a less restrictive notion than truth-making, because grounding does
not require that the ultimate source of what is true should lie in
what exists, rather we can remain open about what form grounding
takes. Moreover, whilst there may be genuine questions about what the
ground is for the truth of the representation that <em>p</em> there
may be further questions about what makes it the case that <em>p</em>
and these questions will typically have nothing to do with
representation as such. Because truth-making is typically understood
in modal terms, i.e. necessitation is conceived to be sufficient for
truth-making, Fine is also sceptical that there is any way of avoiding
the over-generation of truth-makers we have already discussed (see 1.1
and 1.2 above). Finally, Fine thinks that we should be able to
conceive of the world hierarchically, whereby (e.g.) the normative is
grounded in the natural, the natural in the physical and the physical
in the micro-physical. But this is difficult to do if we think in
terms of truth-making, because if (e.g.) we conceive of a normative
representation being made true by the existence of something natural,
that natural thing is just the wrong sort of thing to be made true by
something at the physical level because it is not a
representation.</p>

<p>
Fine&rsquo;s critique of truth-making presupposes that we can only
avail ourselves of truth-making if we conceive of truth-making in
monolithic terms, as providing a unique method for metaphysics. But
whilst, for example, Armstrong may have had a tendency to think in
such terms, this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be mandated by the nature of
truth-making itself. One might, as Asay (2017) argues, instead
conceive of grounding and truth-making as complementary projects,
whereby a theory of truth-making doesn&rsquo;t purport to do
everything a theory of grounding does and so reciprocal illumination
remains a live possibility.</p>

<p>
The second approach, outlined above, refusing grounding but favouring
truth-making, is advanced by Heil (2016). Heil is generally suspicious
of grounding because grounding is often characterized in different and
incompatible ways, so he is sceptical that there is a univocal concept
of grounding to be had. But, more specifically, Heil has long
maintained that hierarchical conceptions of reality spell trouble
because of the difficulties explaining the causal and nomological
relationship between the layers (Heil 2003: 31&ndash;9). He argues
that this was the problem identified for supervenience and realization
in the &lsquo;90s and it&rsquo;s a problem inherited by the
hierarchical conception of reality to which grounding gives rise. So
Heil does a modus tollens where Fine does a modus ponens. Whilst Fine
conceives of the hierarchical styles of explanation grounding provides
as one of the principal virtues of grounding, Heil considers this is
one of the deepest drawbacks of grounding. So Heil recommends seeking
truth-makers as the proper methodology for metaphysics because it
enables us to give a non-hierarchical description of reality whereby
fundamental physics gives us the truth-makers for truths that have
truth-makers.</p>

<p>
Suppose, however, that the notion of truthmaking were to admit of a
satisfactory analysis or elucidation in terms of grounding. It&rsquo;s
still further question whether this shows truthmaking to be a
respectable notion. Because if grounding isn&rsquo;t, truthmaking
isn&rsquo;t either and whether grounding is intelligible or an
eligible candidate to serve a foundational role in metaphysics is
controversial (Daly 2012, 2023, Wilson 2014, Miller and Norton 2017,
MacBride and Janssen-Lauret 2022). It might be replied that even
though grounding is controversial, if it it did help yield a
satisfactory account of truthmaking that would have advanced our
understanding of truthmaking and would be a point in grounding&rsquo;s
favour. But if grounding is dubious and controversial that undermines
the prospects of it providing a satisfactory account of truthmaking
(or, indeed, of anything else).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="WhiRanTruEliMadTruIfAny">2. Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)?</h2>

<p>
Agreeing about what it is to be a truth-maker, isn&rsquo;t <em>eo
ipso</em> to agree about the range of truths that are eligible to be
made true. There is potential for disagreement here because different
ranges of truths appear to require different kinds of truth-makers and
some may not appear to require any truth-makers at all. So, for
example, an unwillingness to countenance one or other kind of
truth-maker, may force a reconsideration of which truths really
require truth-makers or even a reconsideration of what it is to be a
truth-maker. We can get a sense of the complex interplay of forces at
work here by starting out from the most simple and general principle
about truth-making, i.e. maximalism, and then seeing what pressures
there are to make us step back from it.</p>

<h3 id="Max">2.1 Maximalism</h3>

<p>
Truth-maker <em>maximalism</em> is the doctrine that no truth lacks a
truthmaker, hence,</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Maximalism</em>)</dt>
<dd>For every truth, there must be something in the world that makes
it true.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Maximalism lies at one end of the spectrum of positions potentially
available to occupy. At the other end, lies <em>truth-maker
nihilism</em>, the view that no truth needs to be made true because
there is no such role as making something true for anything to
perform. <em>Truth-maker optimalism</em> is the intermediate position
that only some truths stand in need of truth-makers: not so few that
truth fails to be anchored in reality but not so many that we strain
credulity about the kinds of things there are.</p>

<p>
What is there to be said in defence of maximalism? Even though he
favours it, Armstrong finds himself obliged to admit that &ldquo;I do
not have any direct argument&rdquo; for recommending the position
(2004: 7). Instead he expresses the hope that &lsquo;philosophers of
realist inclinations&rsquo; will find the view &lsquo;immediately
attractive&rsquo;. So instead let us follow Armstrong and treat
maximalism as a &ldquo;hypothesis to be tested&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Maximalism needs to be distinguished from the even stronger claim,</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Correspondence</em>)</dt>
<dd>For each truth there is exactly one thing that makes it true and
for each truth-maker there is exactly one truth made true by it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There&rsquo;s clear blue water between these claims because if we
combine maximalism with (<em>Entailment</em>)&mdash;that whatever
makes a truth <em>p</em> true makes what <em>p</em> entails true too.
So <em>p</em> and all of its consequences are not only all made true
(as maximalism demands) but they also share a truth-maker (as
<em>Correspondence</em> denies). This takes us halfway to appreciating
that so far from being an inevitably profligate doctrine&mdash;as its
name suggests&mdash;maximalism is compatible with denying that some
logically complex claims have their own bespoke truth-makers. (The
inspiration for thinking this way comes from the logical atomism of
Russell (1918&ndash;19) that admitted some logically complex facts but
not others&mdash;it is to be contrasted with Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
version of the doctrine (1921) which admitted only atomic facts.)</p>

<p>
Suppose, for the sake of expounding the view, that some truth-bearers
are atomic. Also suppose that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are atomic and
<em>t</em> makes <em>P</em> true. Then, by <em>Entailment</em>,
<em>t</em> makes <em>P</em> &or; <em>Q</em> true too. Similarly, if
<em>s</em> makes <em>P</em> true and <em>s</em>* makes <em>Q</em> true
then, by <em>Entailment</em>, <em>s</em> and <em>s*</em> together make
<em>P</em> &amp; <em>Q</em> true. Since the task of making <em>P</em>
&or; <em>Q</em> and <em>P</em> &amp; <em>Q</em> true has already been
discharged by the truth-makers for the atomic truth bearers, there is
no need to posit additional truth-makers for making these disjunctive
and conjunctive truths true. Similar reasoning suggests that there is
no need to posit bespoke truth-makers for existential generalisations
or truths of identity either (Mulligan, Simons, &amp; Smith 1984: 313;
Simons 1992: 161&ndash;3; Armstrong 2004: 54&ndash;5). But maximalism
is not thereby compromised: even though disjunctive and conjunctive
truths lack specific truth-makers of their own, they&rsquo;re still
made true by the truth-makers of the basic or atomic claims from which
they&rsquo;re compounded by the logical operations of disjunction and
conjunction.</p>

<p>
But positing truth-makers for atomic truths doesn&rsquo;t obviate the
need&mdash;supposing maximalism&mdash;to posit additional truth-makers
for negative and universal truths. This becomes apparent in the case
of negative truths when we compare the truth-tables for conjunction
and disjunction with the truth-table for negation. The former tell us
that the truth of a disjunctive formula is determined by the truth of
one or other of its disjuncts, whilst the truth of a conjunctive
formula is determined by the truth of both its conjuncts. But the
truth-table for negation doesn&rsquo;t tell us how the truth of
~<em>P</em> is determined by the truth of some other atomic formula
<em>Q</em> from which ~<em>P</em> follows; it only tells us that
~<em>P</em> is true iff <em>P</em> is <em>false</em>. The strategy for
avoiding bespoke truth-makers for logically complex truths can&rsquo;t
get a grip in this case: there&rsquo;s no <em>Q</em> such that
supplying a truth-maker for it obviates the necessity of positing an
additional truth-maker for ~<em>P</em> (Russell 1918&ndash;19:
209&ndash;11; Hochberg 1969: 325&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
The problem is even starker for universal truths: there&rsquo;s no
truth-table for them because there is no set of atomic formulae whose
truth determines that a universally quantified formula is true too.
Why so? Because whatever true atomic formulae we light upon
(<em>Fa</em>, <em>Fb</em>&hellip; <em>Fn</em>), it doesn&rsquo;t
follow from them that &forall;<em>xFx</em> is true. To extract the
general conclusion one would need to add to the premises that
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>&hellip; <em>n</em> are <em>all</em> the things
there are; that there&rsquo;s no extra thing waiting in the wings to
appear on stage that isn&rsquo;t <em>F</em>. But this extra premise is
itself universally quantified, not atomic. So it can&rsquo;t be argued
that the truth-makers for <em>Fa</em>, <em>Fb</em>&hellip; <em>Fn</em>
put together already discharge the task of making &forall;<em>xFx</em>
true because they entail it (Russell 1918&ndash;9: 236&ndash;7;
Hochberg 1969: 335&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
It follows that if maximalism is true then negative and universal
truths have bespoke truthmakers, i.e., not just combinations of
truthmakers for atomic truths. So what might the truthmakers be for
such truths?</p>

<p>
Before turning to consider answers to that question, note two other
challenges to maximalism. (1) Take the most encompassing negative
existential of all: absolutely nothing exists. Surely this statement
is possibly true. But if it were true then something would have to
exist to make it true if the principle that every truth has a
truth-maker is to be upheld. But then there would have to be something
rather than nothing. So combining maximalism with the conviction that
there could have been nothing rather than something leads to
contradiction (Lewis 1998: 220, 2001: 611). So unless we already have
reason to think there must be something rather than nothing&mdash;as
both Armstrong (1989b: 24&ndash;5) and Lewis (1986: 73&ndash;4) think
they do&mdash;maximalism is already in trouble. (2) Milne raise the
charge that the sentence (M): This sentence has no truthmaker, cannot
have a truthmaker because if it had a truthmaker it would be true and
if it was true it wouldn&rsquo;t have a truthmaker because
that&rsquo;s what it says. <em>Ergo</em> it cannot have a truthmaker.
But if it has no truthmaker (M) is true. So there is at least one
sentence, (M), that lacks a truthmaker (Milne 2005). For further

<h3 id="TruMakForNegTru">2.2 Truth-makers for Negative Truths</h3>

<p>
Russell&rsquo;s favoured class of truthmaker for negative truths was
negative facts, but, he reflected,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is implanted in the human breast an almost unquenchable desire
to find some way of avoiding the admission that negative facts are as
ultimate as those that are positive. (1919: 287)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He was right that our desire for positive facts and things makes us
awkward about acknowledging that negative facts or things are the
truth-makers of negative truths. Nonetheless, discussions about
whether there are positive or negative facts are fraught by the
difficulty of telling whether a fact is negative or positive. This is
because, as Russell noted, there is &ldquo;no formal test&rdquo; or
&ldquo;general definition&rdquo; for being a negative fact; we
&ldquo;must go into the meanings of words&rdquo; (1918&ndash;19:
215&ndash;6). Statements of the form &ldquo;<em>a</em> is
<em>F</em>&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t invariably positive, witness:
&ldquo;so-and-so is dead&rdquo;, nor are statements of the form
&ldquo;<em>a</em> isn&rsquo;t <em>F</em>&rdquo; always negative,
witness: &ldquo;so-and-so isn&rsquo;t blind&rdquo;. But it
doesn&rsquo;t follow from the fact that a syntactic test cannot be
given that there is nothing to the contrast between positive and
negative. Molnar suggests that the contrast can be put on a sound
scientific footing. For Molnar, natural kinds are paradigm instances
of the positive, to be identified on <em>a posteriori</em> grounds
(2000: 73). To say that a thing belongs to a natural kind identified
in this way is to state a positive fact. To state a negative fact is
to negate a statement of a positive fact.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s a very natural suggestion that if the negative claim that
<em>a</em> isn&rsquo;t <em>F</em> is true it&rsquo;s made true by the
existence of something positive that&rsquo;s <em>incompatible</em>
with <em>a</em>&rsquo;s being <em>F</em> (Demos 1917). For example,
the truth-maker for the claim that kingfishers aren&rsquo;t yellow is
the fact that they&rsquo;re blue because their being blue is
incompatible with their being yellow. But what makes it true that
these colours are incompatible? The notion of <em>incompatibility</em>
appears itself to be negative&mdash;a relation that obtains between
two states when it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> possible for them to obtain
together. So this proposal threatens to generate a regress:
we&rsquo;ll need to find another positive truth-maker for the further
negative claim that yellow and blue are incompatible, something whose
obtaining is incompatible with the state of yellow and blue&rsquo;s
being compatible, and so on (Russell 1918&ndash;9: 213&ndash;5, 1919:
287&ndash;9; Taylor 1952: 438&ndash;40; Hochberg 1969: 330&ndash;1).
There&rsquo;s another worry: it&rsquo;s not obvious that there are
enough positive states out there to underwrite all the negative truths
there are. Even though it may be true that this liquid is odourless
this needn&rsquo;t be because there&rsquo;s something further about it
that excludes its being odorous (Taylor 1952: 447; Mulligan, Simons,
&amp; Smith 1984: 314).</p>

<p>
One could circumvent the threatened regress by denying that the
incompatibilities in question require truth-makers of their own
because they&rsquo;re necessary truths and such truths are a
legitimate exception to maximalism&mdash;because &ldquo;they are true
come (or exist) what may&rdquo; (Simons 2005: 254; Mellor 2003: 213).
There is some plausibility to the idea that tautologies don&rsquo;t
stand in need of truth-makers; their truth is settled by the
truth-tables of the logical constants. But material necessary
truths&mdash;such as that expressed by &ldquo;yellow is incompatible
with blue&rdquo;&mdash;appear to make just as substantive demands upon
the world as contingent truths do (Molnar 2000: 74). In a sense they
appear to make even more of a demand since the world must be so
endowed that it could not in any circumstances have failed to live up
to the expectations of material necessary truths. It&rsquo;s a
peculiar feature of our philosophical culture that even though
it&rsquo;s almost universally acknowledged that Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
plan (1921: 6.37) to show all necessity is logical necessity ended in
failure&mdash;indeed foundered upon the very problem of explaining
colour incompatibilities&mdash;that so many philosophers continue to
think and talk as though the only necessities were formal ones so that
necessary truths don&rsquo;t need truth-makers (MacBride 2011:
176&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Russell reluctantly chose to acknowledge negative facts as
truth-makers for negative truths (but see Veber 2008 for a defence of
the incompatibility view of negative truths). He just couldn&rsquo;t
see any way of living without them. But negative facts are an unruly
bunch. Try to think of all the ways you are. Contrast that with the
even harder task of thinking of all the ways you aren&rsquo;t! If
negative truths are acknowledged as truth-makers they will have to be
indefinitely numerous, unbounded in their variety; choosing to live
with them is a heavy commitment to make (Armstrong 2004: 55).
What&rsquo;s worse, if negative facts are akin to positive
facts&mdash;as their name suggests&mdash;then they must be made up out
of things, properties and relations arranged together. But, <em>prima
facie</em>, many of these things, properties and relations
aren&rsquo;t existing elements of reality. So unless, like Meinong, we
believe in the non-existent, we&rsquo;ll have to admit that negative
facts aren&rsquo;t configurations of their constituents and so an
entirely different kind of entity from positive facts altogether
(Molnar 2000: 77).</p>

<p>
It is for such reasons that Armstrong counsels us to adopt a more
parsimonious account of what makes negative truths true (2004:
56&ndash;9). Armstrong&rsquo;s own account lies at the opposite
extreme to Russell&rsquo;s. Whereas Russell posited indefinitely
<em>many</em> negative facts to make negative truths true, Armstrong
posits just <em>one</em> thing that&rsquo;s responsible for making
them <em>all</em> true, what he calls a &lsquo;totality fact&rsquo;.
Since Armstrong also posits totality facts as truthmakers for general
truths, let us turn to the matter of truthmakers for general
truths.</p>

<h3 id="TruForGenTru">2.3 Truthmakers for General Truths</h3>

<p>
Armstrong&rsquo;s grand design is to sweep away the difficulties that
attend the admission of negative facts by positing a special kind of
general fact that also serves as the truth-maker for general truths.
Russell admitted general facts too but he acknowledged that, &ldquo;I
do not profess to know what the right analysis of general facts
is&rdquo; (Russell 1918&ndash;9: 236&ndash;7). But Armstrong has gone
further and assigned to general facts the following structure: a
general, or totality fact consists in a binary relation <em>T</em> of
<em>totality</em> that holds between an aggregate on the one hand and
a property on the other when the aggregate comprises <em>all</em> the
items that fall under the property in question (Armstrong 1989b:
93&ndash;4, 1997: 199&ndash;200, 2004: 72&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
Consider the following example to get a sense of what Armstrong has in
mind. China, France, the Russian Federation, the U.K. and the U.S.A.
comprise the permanent membership of the UN Security Council. So the
aggregate (<em>A</em>) of them bears the totality relation <em>T</em>
to the property (<em>P</em>) of being a permanent member of the
Council (<em>T</em>(<em>A</em>, <em>P</em>)). Since the aggregate
bears that relation to that property, there can be no other permanent
members of the Council who aren&rsquo;t already included in it. So the
totality fact <em>T</em>(<em>A</em>, <em>P</em>) suffices for the
general truth that China, France, the Russian Federation, the U.K. and
the U.S.A are <em>all</em> its members. It also suffices for the truth
of the negative existential that there are <em>no</em> other members
of the Council. So once we&rsquo;ve recognised that <em>T</em>(<em>A,
P</em>) exists, there&rsquo;s no need to recognise additional bespoke
truth-makers for these negative truths.</p>

<p>
Now, according to Armstrong, we can avoid the need to posit negative
facts by affirming &ldquo;the biggest totality state of all, the one
embracing all lower-order states of affairs&rdquo;, i.e., the
existence of a totality state that consists in an aggregate of all the
(1<sup>st</sup> order) states of affairs there are related by
<em>T</em> to the property of <em>being a (1<sup>st</sup> order)
states of affairs</em> (2004: 75). It&rsquo;s a defining feature of
Armstrong&rsquo;s metaphysics that the world is &ldquo;a world of
states of affairs, with particulars and universals only having
existence within states of affairs&rdquo; (1989: 94). Consequently
this totality state, the biggest one, comprises a vast swathe of what
exists&mdash;whether particulars, universals or states of affairs that
consist in particulars having universals. So it follows from the
existence of this totality fact that there are no more (1<sup>st</sup>
order) states of affairs that are not already included in the
aggregate of states that <em>T</em> relates to the property of
<em>being a (1<sup>st</sup> order) states of affairs</em>. Nor are
there any particulars or (1<sup>st</sup> order) universals had by
those particulars that are not constituents of the state of affairs
included in that aggregate. It also follows that there are no more
particulars or (1<sup>st</sup> order) universals. So this totality
fact serves as truth-maker for all these negative truths.</p>

<p>
It is sometimes objected that such totality facts are just negative
facts in disguise: &ldquo;Totality statements state the non-existence
of certain entities, they state &lsquo;no more facts&rsquo;&rdquo;; so
we should reject totality facts if we are dissatisfied with negative
ones (Molnar 2000: 81&ndash;2). Armstrong responds to this charge with
equanimity: &ldquo;It is not denied, of course, that the totalling or
alling relation involves negation. It sets a limit to the things of
that sort&rdquo; (2004: 73). But if negation has indeed been smuggled
into the description of the role that <em>T</em> performs in
comprising a totality state then it is difficult to avoid the
suspicion that Armstrong has simply exchanged many negative facts for
one big one. But we may think of Armstrong&rsquo;s contribution in a
different way. There are two ostensible concerns that negative states
of affairs present. First, there is a concern about their number.
Second, there is a concern about, so to speak, their
<em>negativity</em>. Armstrong has addressed the first concern by
showing how we may reduce the number of negative states of affairs.
Armstrong judges that the second concern doesn&rsquo;t need to be
addressed&mdash;because, as Armstrong reflects, we cannot eliminate
negation from our description of the world.</p>

<p>
According to C.B. Martin, Armstrong&rsquo;s proposal conflicts with
common sense because we already recognise in ordinary discourse that
different negative truths have different truth-makers&mdash;not just
one as Armstrong proposes (1996: 59). For example, we recognise that
what makes it true that there is no oil in this car&rsquo;s engine is
different from what makes it true that there are no dodos left. What
makes claims like these true are absences, lacks, limits, holes and
voids, where these are conceived not as things but as
&ldquo;<em>localised</em> states of the world&rdquo;, robustly
first-order and &ldquo;causally relevant&rdquo; to what goes on
(Martin 1996: 58, 65&ndash;6; Taylor 1952: 443&ndash;5). But, as many
philosophers have argued, when we talk about an absence having causal
effects what we&rsquo;re really saying can be understood without
reifying negative states and appealing instead to the actual effects,
or the counterfactual effects, of a positive state (Molnar 2000:
77&ndash;80; Armstrong 2004: 64&ndash;7; Lewis 2004; Beebee 2004)</p>

<p>
It has also been objected that Armstrong&rsquo;s position gives rise
to a &ldquo;paradox of totality&rdquo; (Armstrong 1989: 94, 1997:
198&ndash;9, 2004: 78&ndash;9; Cox 1997: 53&ndash;60; Molnar 2000:
81). Take the totality state of affairs that comprises all the
(1<sup>st</sup> order) state of affairs. Since this (2<sup>nd</sup>
order) state is itself a state of affairs it follows that the initial
aggregate of (1<sup>st</sup> order) states of affairs failed to
comprise all the states of affairs there are. So there must be a
further totality state that comprised the aggregate of all of them.
But this (3<sup>rd</sup> order) state is also a state of affairs so it
will need to be added to the mix too, and so <em>ad
infinitum</em>.</p>

<p>
Armstrong responds to this objection with equanimity too:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we can afford to be casual about this infinite series. For after the
first fact of totality these &ldquo;extra&rdquo; states of affairs are
all supervenient. As such, we do not have to take them with
ontological seriousness. (1989b: 94)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To understand this we need to appreciate that Armstrong&rsquo;s notion
of <em>supervenience</em> is non-standard. For him: &ldquo;an entity
<em>Q</em> supervenes upon entity <em>P</em> if and only if it is
impossible that P should exist and <em>Q</em> not exist&rdquo; or, in
other words that the existence of <em>P</em> entails the existence of
<em>Q</em>. (Armstrong 1997: 11). He also holds a non-standard
conception of ontological commitment, <em>viz</em>. that &ldquo;What
supervenes is no addition of being&rdquo; (Armstrong 1997: 12, 2004:
23&ndash;4). Armstrong&rsquo;s idea is (roughly) that to be a genuine
addition to being is to be a net (indispensable) contributor to the
schedule of truth-makers for all the truths. But supervenient entities
are superfluous as truth-makers. If the existence of an <em>R</em>
entails the existence of a certain <em>S</em> which in turn entails
the truth of <em>P</em>, then <em>R</em> already makes <em>P</em> true
so there is no need to include <em>S</em> in the inventory of
truth-makers. It follows that supervenient entities, like <em>S</em>,
are no addition of being (Lewis 1992: 216).</p>

<p>
Now bring this non-standard conception of ontological commitment to
bear upon the envisaged infinite series of totality facts. It is
impossible that the 2<sup>nd</sup> order totality fact comprising all
the 1st order states of affairs exist and the 3<sup>rd</sup> order
totality fact comprising all the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
order states not exist. So the 3<sup>rd</sup> totality fact&mdash;or
any other state higher-order than it&mdash;is entailed by the
existence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> order totality state. So all of these
<em>n</em> &gt; 2 higher-order totality states supervene on it.
That&rsquo;s why Armstrong doesn&rsquo;t think we need to take any of
them with ontological seriousness.</p>

<p>
What should we make of this non-standard conception of ontological
commitment in terms of truth-making: that to be is to be a
truth-maker? An argument is owed that we can&rsquo;t legitimately
commit ourselves to the existence of things that perform theoretical
roles outside the theory of truth-makers. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we allow
that there are other theoretical roles for existing things to perform?
Indeed it&rsquo;s a very real possibility that when we come to
understand the capacity of the truth-makers to make truth-bearers true
we will find ourselves embroiled in commitment to the existence of
other things in their explanatory wake that aren&rsquo;t truth-makers
themselves (MacBride 2011: 169). In fact Armstrong himself should have
been one of the first to recognise this. For it has been an abiding
feature of Armstrong&rsquo;s world view that we are obliged to
acknowledge not only states affairs, which are truth makers, but also
properties and relations, constituents of states of affairs, which
aren&rsquo;t. Cameron (2008c) has proposed that Armstrong&rsquo;s
conception should <em>replace</em> the standard one that to be is to
be the value of a variable. But there&rsquo;s the further difficulty
that this threatens to cut off the branch the advocates of truth-maker
theory are sitting on: if they disavow that existential quantification
is ontologically committing then they will be left without a means of
expressing what, according to truthmaker theory, are the existing
truthmakers (Schaffer 2010: 16&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
More generally still, can we make any sense of the idea of &ldquo;an
ontological free lunch&rdquo;? Why is something supervenient no
addition to being? Even if we only ever came to recognise the
existence of one supervening entity would we not thereby have
<em>added</em> at least one extra item to our inventory of things that
exist? Of course in the special case where the supervening entity is
<em>constituted</em> by the entities it supervenes upon&mdash;i.e.,
the things that are already there&mdash;it makes some sense to say
that it&rsquo;s not adding anything new; but what Armstrong et al.
declare to be ontological free lunches aren&rsquo;t typically
constituted from the entities upon which they supervene (Lewis 1992:
213, Melia 2005: 74&ndash;5). Accordingly Schulte (2011a, 2011b)
argues that no necessitarian or grounding account of truth-making can
make sense of the notion of an ontological free lunch, maintaining
instead that truthmaker theory needs to be augmented with the idea
that we are offering a reductive explanation when we make an
explanation in terms of truthmakers. Where does this leave us? So long
as Armstrong&rsquo;s non-standard conception of ontological commitment
remains controversial, it also remains controversial whether the
infinite series of totality facts to which Armstrong is
&ldquo;committed&rdquo; may be welcomed as an ontological
free-lunch.</p>

<h3 id="Opt">2.4 Optimalism</h3>

<p>
One way to respond to these difficulties is to abandon maximalism in
favour of optimalism, to deny that universal and negative statements
need truth-makers. But Merricks argues the optimalist &ldquo;way
out&rdquo; is blocked. Negative truths need truth-makers if any truths
do, but they can&rsquo;t have them. So, according to Merricks, we must
give up thinking that truths need truth-makers in the first place
(2007: 39&ndash;67).</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s why Merricks thinks so. In order to avoid the
over-generation of truth-makers for necessary truths (<em>etc</em>.)
Merricks imposes a relevance constraint : &ldquo;a truth-maker must be
that which its truth is about&rdquo;, so akin to Smith&rsquo;s
requirement that a truthmaker fall within the subject matter of the
proposition it makes tree (Smith 1999, Merricks 2007: 28). But can
this constraint be satisfied in the case of negative existentials,
such as the statement there are no hobbits? This statement isn&rsquo;t
about hobbits, because there aren&rsquo;t any, and other apparent
candidates, such as the universe&rsquo;s exhibiting the global
property of <em>being such that there are no hobbits in it</em>,
appear hoaxed up and artificial (2007: 43&ndash;55). Even if one
follows Merricks this far, one may still think that negative
existentials are the principled exception that proves the rule that a
truth-maker for a positive truth must be what its truth is about. But,
so far as Merricks is concerned, this is throwing the baby out with
the bathwater:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I deny that if we set aside the intuition that &ldquo;a truth, any
truth&rdquo; depends on being we are left with the equally compelling
intuition that all truths <em>except negative existentials</em> depend
on being. (2007: 41)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He further suggests that this position is theoretically disingenuous
because no one would consider retreating to it from full-blown
maximalism unless he or she had already been &ldquo;spooked&rdquo; by
his or her failure to find truth-makers for negative truths; or if
they held onto the view that truth is correspondence (Merricks 2007:
40&ndash;1; Dodd 2007: 394; Cameron 2008a: 411). Merricks surmises
that if we have any reason to commit to truth-makers, we have only
reason to commit outright to a truth-maker for every truth
(maximalism). But since maximalism cannot be sustained because of the
lack of things for negative existentials to be about, Merricks
recommends the rejection of truth-makers altogether.</p>

<p>
But optimalists aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;spooked&rdquo; or
&ldquo;timid&rdquo; maximalists. They stand on their two feet with a
principled position of their own that need neither be based upon
&ldquo;gerrymandered intuition&rdquo; nor adopted as a consequence of
a forced retreat from maximalism. If maximalism is intellectual heir
to Russell&rsquo;s logical atomism, then optimalism (at least in the
form under consideration) is heir to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s version of
the doctrine according to which it is only atomic propositions that
represent the existence of states of affairs. The optimalists&rsquo;
idea is that once truth-makers have been supplied for the atomic
truths there is simply <em>no need</em> to posit further truth-makers
for the molecular ones. All we need to recognise is that an atomic
statement <em>P</em> is true whenever a truth-maker for <em>P</em>
exists, that <em>P</em> is false if and only if no truth-maker for
<em>P</em> exists. Once the existence and non-existence of the
truth-makers has settled the truth-values of all the atomic
statements, the logical operations described by the truth-tables then
settle the truth and falsity of all the molecular statements (another
story must be told about what the truth-makers are for the
non-extensional constructions&mdash;another elephant in the room). In
particular, the truth-table for negation&mdash;that tells us what
&ldquo;~&rdquo; means&mdash;assures us that if <em>P</em> is false
then ~<em>P</em> is true. So all it takes to make ~<em>P</em> true is
that no truth-maker for <em>P</em> exists. Thus Mulligan, Simons, and
Smith:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it seems more adequate to regard sentences of the given kind as true
not in virtue of any truth-maker of their own, but simply in virtue of
the fact that the corresponding positive sentences have no
truth-maker. (1984: 315; see also Mellor 2003: 213&ndash;4, 2009;
Simons 2000:7&ndash;8, 2005: 255&ndash;6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Optimalists also think that general truths are true without need for
bespoke truth-makers (like totality facts) because they are logically
equivalent to truths that don&rsquo;t need truthmakers. For example, a
universal quantification &forall;xFx is logically equivalent to the
negative statement &sim;&exist;x&sim;Fx. Since the latter is negative,
it&rsquo;s true, if it is, because no truthmaker exists for
&exist;x&sim;Fx. Then because the former is logically equivalent to
the latter, the optimalists concludes that &forall;xFx isn&rsquo;t
true in virtue of a bespoke truthmaker of its own but simply because
no truthmaker for its negation exists (Mellor 2003: 214; Simons 2008:
14&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
Jago (2012, 2018: 81&ndash;102) presents a dilemma against
non-maximalists (optimalists). Here&rsquo;s a sketch. The
non-maximalist will accept (at least) two types of true proposition:
those requiring truthmakers (&lsquo;positive&rsquo; propositions
saying how reality is) and those that don&rsquo;t (&lsquo;negative
propositions&rsquo; saying how reality isn&rsquo;t). (Some true
propositions may be a mix of the two. These are true derivatively).
Now consider proposition P: &lt;Jo knows that Shamima doesn&rsquo;t
have an aunt&gt;. Suppose P is true. Here&rsquo;s the first horn of
the dilemma. P is a true positive proposition, so there must be a
truthmaker T for it. By necessitation and the factivity of knowledge,
whatever T might be, it must necessitate the nonexistence of
Shamima&rsquo;s aunt. But a truthmaker which necessitates the
nonexistence of something, so is a &lsquo;negative fact&rsquo;,
belongs to a maximalist ontology &ndash; an ontology the
non-maximalist purportedly eschewed. Here&rsquo;s the second. If the
non-maximalist can provide truthmakers for P that aren&rsquo;t
negative facts then the maximalist can use the same truthmakers for
negative propositions. So either the non-maximalist doesn&rsquo;t
evade the negative facts of the maximalist or the maximalist can adopt
the non-maximalist strategy in order to avoid negative facts whilst
continuing to hold that every truth has a positive truthmaker. Further
defences of and challenges for the optimalist or non-maximalist are
discussed in Simpson 2014, Skiles 2014, Griffith 2015, Schipper 2018,
Asay 2020: 71&ndash;91, Jago 2020.</p>

<h3 id="TruSupUpoBei">2.5 Truth Supervenes Upon Being</h3>

<p>
Optimalism retains the original demand for truth-makers but restricts
it to atomic statements. Optimalism accordingly disavows a commitment
to truth-makers for negative statements and statements of generality.
But Bigelow&#9135;also wary of the commitments that maximalism
engenders to negative and totality facts&#9135; weakens what
truth-making means to a point where negative and general statements
don&rsquo;t require bespoke truth-makers of their own (1988:
131&ndash;3). He offers the following principle to capture the kernel
of truth in truth-making worth saving.</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Truth Supervenes on Being</em>)</dt>
<dd>If something is true then it would not be possible for it to be
false unless either certain things were to exist which don&rsquo;t, or
else certain things had not existed which do (Bigelow 1988: 133).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This principle allows atomic truths to have truth-makers&#9135;because
it would only be possible for them to be false if certain things had
not existed: their truth-makers. But it also allows negative truths to
be true without them. The statement that there are no dragons gets to
be true because it would only be possible for that statement to be
false if something which hadn&rsquo;t existed (dragons) did exist.
Such statements are true not because they have truth-makers but
because they have no counterexamples, &ldquo;they lack
false-makers&rdquo; (Lewis 1992: 216, 2001: 610).</p>

<p>
General truths are also true for lack of false-makers. The statement
that everything is physical (if true) is true because it would only be
possible for the statement to be false if something that hadn&rsquo;t
existed did, <em>viz</em>. something that wasn&rsquo;t physical. So
when truth-making is understood in this weakened sense there is no
need to acknowledge, e.g., an additional totality fact to make it true
that there are only five coins in my pocket; it&rsquo;s enough that if
I hadn&rsquo;t stopped adding coins that statement would have been
false because then there would have been at least one other coin in my
pocket (Heil 2000: 236&ndash;240; Bricker 2006).</p>

<p>
Despite their differences, optimalism and (<em>Truth Supervenes Upon
Being</em>) share a key idea in common&mdash;that a negative
existential truth isn&rsquo;t true because something exists, but
because something doesn&rsquo;t, <em>viz</em>. a truth-maker for its
contradictory, a false-maker for it. C.B. Martin has objected that
this doesn&rsquo;t obviate the need to posit truth-makers for negative
existentials. This is because a statement that there are no
false-makers for a negative existential truth is itself a negative
existential truth. So this statement &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be used to
explain or show how the latter needs no truth-making state of the
world for it to be true&rdquo; (1996: 61). Lewis takes Martin&rsquo;s
objection to be that this account of the truth of negative truths
isn&rsquo;t informative. Take the statement that there are no
unicorns. Why is it true? Well because there are no unicorns.
That&rsquo;s not much of an explanation! But, Lewis retorts, the
positive existential statement that there is a cat is true because
there is a cat. That&rsquo;s &ldquo;No explanation at all, and none
the worse for that&rdquo; (Lewis 2001: 611&ndash;12).</p>

<p>
Lewis argued that the doctrine that truth supervenes upon being is an
uncomfortable halfway house. He began by arguing that the retreat from
maximalism was always necessary. He pointed out how deeply
counterintuitive it is to suppose that negative existentials are true
because their truth-makers exist. It seems, offhand, that they are
true not because some things do exist but because some don&rsquo;t.
&ldquo;Why defy this first impression?&rdquo; (1992: 204). But, more
importantly, Lewis pointed out that maximalism was incompatible with
what he took to be the Humean principle governing our thought about
modality: that anything can co-exist with anything else that&rsquo;s
distinct. But it is the <em>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</em> of any
truth-maker for the negative existential truth that there are no
unicorns&mdash;if there is one and whatever else it is like&mdash;that
even though it is distinct from all unicorns it cannot co-exist with
any of them. Why? Because otherwise it would make it true that there
are no unicorns even in circumstances where unicorns existed.
Alternatively, suppose that any putative truthmaker is not distinct
from all unicorns but shares some common part with them. But even
allowing this would not explain why the truthmaker excludes the
existence of unicorns. If anything, the sharing of a common part would
make it more mysterious why the truthmaker excludes their existence.
Similarly it is the <em>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</em> of any
truth-maker for a general truth that such-and-such are all the facts
there are that it refuses to co-exist with any other facts even though
it is distinct from them. So if we&rsquo;re to hang onto the Humean
principle that anything can co-exist with anything else, we&rsquo;d
better give up the demand for truth-makers for negative and general
truths&mdash;in other words, give up maximalism (Lewis 1992: 205,
2001: 610&ndash;11).</p>

<p>
Lewis also argued that we can&rsquo;t stop here&mdash;just giving up
maximalism&mdash;because even the truth-makers for atomic statements
conflict with his Humeanism. An atomic, contingent statement
&lsquo;<em>a</em> is <em>F</em>&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t made true by
<em>a</em> or <em>F</em> or even the mereological fusion <em>a+F</em>
because they can exist even in circumstances where <em>a</em> and
<em>F</em> are unrelated, say when <em>a</em> is <em>G</em> rather
than <em>F</em> whilst <em>b</em> is <em>F</em> instead. For this
reason, many maximalists make common cause with optimalists and posit
another fundamental kind of thing to perform the truth-making role for
contingent predications: facts that consist in objects, properties and
relations inhering together; in this case the fact that <em>a</em> is
<em>F</em> (Armstrong 1989a: 41&ndash;2, 1997: 115&ndash;6; Mellor
1995: 24).</p>

<p>
Now facts aren&rsquo;t mereological fusions, Lewis argued, because
facts require more for their existence than the existence of their
constituents, its also being required that their constituents inhere
together for facts to exist. Assuming that only mereological fusions
have parts, it follows that the constituents of facts aren&rsquo;t
parts of facts, hence that facts are entirely distinct from their
constituents. But even though <em>a</em> and <em>F</em> are entirely
distinct from <em>a</em> is <em>F</em>, the existence of <em>a</em> is
<em>F</em> necessitates the existence of <em>a</em> and <em>F</em>.
More generally, the obtaining of a fact necessitates the existence of
its constituents even though the fact and its constituents are
entirely distinct. So facts conflict with Lewis&rsquo;s Humeanism
according to which any distinct things may coexist or fail to coexist.
So we cannot posit facts as truth-makers for contingent statements
without going against Humeanism (Lewis 1992: 200, 1998: 215&ndash;6,
2001: 611). Armstrong replied that mereology isn&rsquo;t the only form
of composition, i.e. the constituents of facts are parts of them in a
non-mereological sense, hence facts aren&rsquo;t distinct from their
constituents after all (Armstrong 1997: 119&ndash;122). Lewis&rsquo;s
reply was that the only way to make sense of something&rsquo;s being a
constituent of a state of affairs, without being a mereological part,
was that it lies in a necessary connexion to that state of affairs;
but necessary connexions are what we should seek to avoid (Lewis 2001:
611; MacBride and Janssen-Lauret 2022: 79&ndash;83).</p>

<p>
Other maximalists and optimalists, posit tropes rather than facts as
truth-makers for contingent predications (Martin 1980; Mulligan,
Simons, &amp; Smith 1984: 295&ndash;304, Lowe 2006: 186&ndash;7,
204&ndash;5) Tropes, in the non-transferrable sense, are particular
instances of properties that are existentially dependent upon their
bearers. But Lewis&rsquo; reasoning can be easily extended to show
that non-transferrable tropes cannot serve as the truth-makers for
contingent statements without contradicting Humeanism. If trope
<em>f</em> is a property that <em>a</em> bears rather than a part of
<em>a</em>, then <em>f</em> is wholly distinct from <em>a</em>.
Nevertheless, the existence of <em>f</em> necessitates the existence
of <em>a</em> even though they are distinct Alternatively if
<em>f</em> is a part of the bundle of tropes that constitute
<em>a</em> and <em>f</em> is non-transferrable, then the existence of
<em>f</em> necessitates the existence of some other distinct tropes
that are also parts of this bundle. So Humeanism is violated either
way.</p>

<p>
In order to avoid contradicting Humeanism, Lewis recommended a further
weakening of (<em>Truth Supervenes upon Being</em>). According to
Lewis, the kernel of truth in truth-making is the idea that
propositions have a <em>subject matter</em>. They are <em>about</em>
things so whether they are true or false depends on how those things
stand. This led Lewis to endorse (2003: 25):</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Subject matter</em>)</dt>
<dd>Any proposition has a subject matter, on which its truth value
supervenes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Equivalently, <em>there cannot be a difference in the truth-value of a
proposition without a difference in its subject matter</em>. This
might consist in (1) an increase or decrease in the population of
things that fall within the subject matter; or (2) a shift in the
pattern of fundamental properties and relations those things exhibit
(Lewis 2001: 612). Now the truth value of &ldquo;<em>a</em> is
<em>F</em>&rdquo; supervenes upon its subject matter without there
needing to be any existing thing distinct from <em>a</em> or
<em>F</em> that necessitates their existence; it is enough that the
statement would have been false if <em>a</em> had been something other
than <em>F</em>. So it also follows, although Lewis didn&rsquo;t
explicitly trace out this consequence, that we can avoid contradicting
Humeanism by abandoning optimalism in favour of (<em>Subject
matter</em>).</p>

<p>
In an intriguing twist to the plot, Lewis subsequently appeared to
withdraw his doubts about truth-makers and embrace them after all
(2003: 30, Lewis &amp; Rosen 2003: 39). Here&rsquo;s a rough sketch to
get across the idea. There is a way of interpreting &lsquo;fact&rsquo;
talk that doesn&rsquo;t embroil speakers in a commitment to necessary
connexions between distinct existences. To talk about the fact that
<em>a</em> is <em>F</em> isn&rsquo;t to talk about something distinct
from both <em>a</em> and <em>F</em>. It&rsquo;s talk about <em>a</em>
itself, albeit in a qualified way, namely <em>as</em> <em>F</em> or
&lsquo;<em>qua F</em>&rsquo; as Lewis puts it. So <em>a</em>
<em>qua</em> <em>F</em> qualifies as a truthmaker for the statement
that <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> because <em>a qua F</em> cannot exist
unless <em>a</em> is <em>F</em>. So if <em>a</em> <em>qua F</em>
exists then the statement that <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> is true. But
there are no restrictions thereby imposed on what can or cannot
coexist. That&rsquo;s because whilst <em>a qua F</em> cannot exist
unless <em>a</em> is <em>F</em>, <em>a</em> without the qualification
&lsquo;<em>qua F</em>&rsquo; can exist even if <em>a</em> isn&rsquo;t
<em>F</em>, for example as <em>a qua G</em>. So we can have
truthmakers for contingent predications like <em>a</em> is <em>F</em>
after all because <em>a</em> can just be an ordinary thing. In the
same way that ordinary objects like <em>a</em> can serve as
truth-makers for contingent predications, Lewis &amp; Rosen (2003)
suggest that the entire world&mdash;&ldquo;the totality of everything
there actually is&rdquo;&mdash;can serve as the truth-maker for
negative existentials. Take the world <em>qua</em> unaccompanied by
unicorns. In the conversational context just set up, the world has no
counterparts that are inhabited by unicorns. So the world <em>qua</em>
unaccompanied by unicorns is essentially lacking in unicorns and
therefore qualifies as a truth-maker for the statement that there are
no unicorns. When building the case for (<em>Subject Matter</em>)
Lewis had deliberately remained neutral about the metaphysics of
modality (2001: 605). But to explain what &lsquo;<em>qua F</em>&rsquo;
constructions mean, Lewis broke his neutrality and availed himself of
his favoured theory of counterparts according to which
&lsquo;<em>a</em> is essentially <em>F</em> just in case all of
<em>a</em>&rsquo;s counterparts (including <em>a</em> itself) are
<em>F</em>&rsquo; (2003: 27). So, roughly, &lsquo;<em>a qua</em>
F&rsquo; stands for all of <em>a</em>&rsquo;s counterparts that are
<em>F</em>.</p>

<p>
Has Lewis shown how it is possible to garner truth-makers for
contingent predications and negative existentials without positing
totality facts or tropes that ensnare us in a web of necessary
connections? We need to be clear about what Lewis was doing. He
wasn&rsquo;t belatedly recognising what he had previously denied, that
the truth-making role is genuine, but then ingeniously coming up with
the idea that <em>qua</em>-versions of things perform this role just
as effectively as states of affairs, only without necessary
connections between distinct existences. Rather, Lewis&rsquo; aim in
this paper is to damn the very idea of truth-makers with faint praise.
By showing how <em>qua</em> versions of things performed the
truth-making role just as effectively as facts or tropes Lewis aimed
to show how explanatorily light weight the truth-making role truly
was.</p>

<p>
There are various criticisms of detail to be made. MacBride (2005:
130&ndash;2) points out that Lewis failed to provide truthmakers for
relational predications and argues that it is very difficult to see
how the lacuna can be filled when the class of eligible truthmakers is
restricted by Lewis to the class of ordinary things. So, for example,
sequences cannot serve as truthmakers for relational predications
because sequences aren&rsquo;t ordinary things. Bricker (2015:
178&ndash;9) raises a difficulty with Lewis&rsquo;s use of counterpart
theory. Lewis maintains that whether a is a truthmaker for <em>a</em>
is <em>F</em> will depend upon whatever counterpart relation is evoked
in context. Bricker argues that this is incompatible with
interpreting the maximalist principle that every truth has a
truthmaker as a single assertion--because it will only be a single
assertion if there is a uniform interpretation in terms of a single
privileged counterpart relation. Lewis might reply that the maximalist
principle needn&rsquo;t be taken as a single assertion but as a schema
where different instances evoke different counterpart relations
<em>even if we didn&rsquo;t appreciate this hitherto</em>. But, in
fact, there seems no reason for Lewis to make that concession because
he is able to say what the maximalist principle amounts to in one
closed formula which Bricker (2017: 174) provides:
<strong>(TMC)</strong> For every true proposition <em>P</em>, there
exists some entity <em>T</em> and some admissible counterpart relation
such that, for every world <em>W</em>, if <em>T</em> has a counterpart
(under that relation) in <em>W</em>, then <em>P</em> is true in
<em>W</em>. Nonetheless Bricker&rsquo;s own proposal (2017:
177&ndash;80) about how to provide an account of truthmaking in terms
of a single counterpart relation is of independent interest.</p>

<h2 id="WhaMotDocTruMak">3. What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers?</h2>

<h3 id="CatChe">3.1 To catch a cheater</h3>

<p>
What is the motivation for adopting a theory of truth-makers, whether
maximalist or optimalist? Sider describes the &ldquo;whole
point&rdquo; of adopting a theory of truth-makers thus: to
&ldquo;Catch the cheaters&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t believe in
truth-makers (Sider 2001: 40&ndash;1; see also Merricks 2007:
2&ndash;3). But this is a bit like saying that the point of a benefit
system is to catch out benefit frauds. It&rsquo;s only if there is
some antecedent point in favour of truth-makers that there can be
anything wrong with leaving them out. Nonetheless, it is possible that
we can come to appreciate the need for truth-makers by appreciating
what is lacking in theories that neglect them. This is how C.B. Martin
and Armstrong came to recognise the necessity for admitting
truth-makers (Armstrong 1989b: 8&ndash;11, 2004: 1&ndash;3). Consider
phenomenalism: the view that the physical world is a construction out
of sense-impressions. One obstacle for this view is the need to make
sense in sense-impression terms of true claims we make about the
unobserved world. Martin noticed that the phenomenalist could only
appeal to brute, ungrounded counterfactuals about possible experience
to do so. But counterfactuals do not float free in a void. They must
be responsive to an underlying reality, the reality that makes them
true. For Martin this was the phenomenalists&rsquo; fatal error: their
inability to supply credible truth-makers for truths about unobserved
objects. The same error afflicted Ryle&rsquo;s behaviourism with its
brute counterfactuals about non-existent behaviour and Prior&rsquo;s
presentism according to which there is nothing outside the present and
so there is nothing for past-tensed and future-tensed truths to be
held responsible to. We come to appreciate the need for truth-makers
as the common need these different theories fail to fulfil.</p>

<p>
According to Lewis, this demand for truth-makers represented an
overreaction to what was undoubtedly a flaw in phenomenalism (1992:
217). We can already understand what&rsquo;s wrong with phenomenalism
when we appreciate that it fails to provide an account of the things
upon which the truth of counterfactuals about sense impressions
supervene, i.e., when we see that it fails to satisfy (<em>Subject
Matter</em>). This leaves under-motivated the claim that phenomenalism
should also be faulted for failing to supply truth-makers to ground
counterfactuals about sense-impressions. The same reasoning applies to
behaviourism and presentism; they also fail to satisfy (<em>Subject
Matter</em>). So there&rsquo;s no need to adopt truth makers to catch
cheats. All we need to do is to recognise the strictures (<em>Subject
Matter</em>) places upon us.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s a further flaw of Martin and Armstrong&rsquo;s reasoning
that even if we accede to the demand for truth-makers it doesn&rsquo;t
follow that even idealism is ruled out. According to Armstrong if we
forsake the demand for truth-makers we thereby challenge &ldquo;the
realistic insight that there is a world that exists independently of
our thoughts and statements, making the latter true or false&rdquo;
(1997: 128). But even an idealist could accept that there are
truth-makers whilst thinking of them as mind-dependent entities. So
acceding to the demand for truth-makers doesn&rsquo;t tell us
what&rsquo;s wrong with idealism (Daly 2005: 95&ndash;7). Bergmann,
the grandfather of the contemporary truth-maker movement, was explicit
about this: &ldquo;the truth of <em>S</em> must be grounded
ontologically. On this first move idealists and realists agree&rdquo;
(Bergmann 1961: 229). The realist-idealist distinction cuts across the
distinction between philosophers who admit truth-makers and those that
don&rsquo;t (Dodd 2002: 83&ndash;4).</p>

<p>
The demand for truth-makers doesn&rsquo;t help &ldquo;catch
cheaters&rdquo; at all. Just acknowledge, e.g., some brute
counterfactual facts about sense data, or brute dispositions to behave
in one way or another, or brute facts about what happened in the past
or will happen in the future. What&rsquo;s unsatisfactory about these
posits isn&rsquo;t that if they existed they&rsquo;d fail to make true
statements about unobserved objects or statements about mental states
that failed to manifest themselves in actual behaviour or statements
about the past or future. The problem is that we have difficulty in
understanding how such facts or dispositions could be explanatorily
sound (Horwich 2009: 195&ndash;7). Whatever we find lacking in
theories that posit such items, it isn&rsquo;t that they fail to
provide truth-makers, because they do.</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s another way to make the point. The demand for
truthmakers turns out to be vacuous. Are the facts the
&ldquo;cheater&rdquo; posits questionable in some further way as
&lsquo;metaphysically strange&rsquo; or &lsquo;spooky&rsquo;? Those
facts are specified in terms of counterfactual or dispositional
truths, so those facts are questionable if and only if truths of these
kinds are. If there is some reason to find such truths questionable,
then that alone is the reason for querying behaviourism or
phenomenalism; the demand for truth-makers was extraneous.</p>

<p>
An alternative line is this: &lsquo;One must approach the question of
which truths have truthmakers on a case-by-case basis&rsquo; Asay
(2020: 23&ndash;7, 2023: 24). One consequence is that a philosophical
theory is not immediately open to criticism on the ground that it
allows truths which lack truthmakers. The &lsquo;catching
cheaters&rsquo; strategy is thereby weakened: it is not a default
assumption that any given truth has a truthmaker and so the burden of
argument does not lie with (say) the phenomenalist or the
behaviourist. Whether their theories are at fault in not positing
truthmakers for certain truths becomes a matter of debate and lacks
easy resolution.</p>

<h3 id="TruDepBei">3.2 Truth Depends on Being</h3>

<p>
Armstrong&rsquo;s original motivation for introducing truthmakers involved
appeal to the following intuition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It seems obvious that for every true contingent proposition there must
be something in the world (in the largest sense of
&ldquo;something&rdquo;) which makes the proposition true. For
consider any true contingent proposition and imagine that it is false.
We must automatically imagine some difference in the world. (Armstrong
1973: 11; c.f., Bigelow 1988: 126)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Armstrong assumes that the word &lsquo;some&rsquo; in &lsquo;some
difference&rsquo; should be interpreted objectually, i.e. as having
the function of ranging over a domain of a entities which are such
that their presence and absence corresponds to the truth and falsity
of continent propositions. With this assumption in place it is easy to
think that there must be some things that we&rsquo;re quantifying over
when we say that there&rsquo;s some difference in the world that
<em>constitutes</em> the difference between these circumstances,
<em>viz</em>. truth makers. However, it shouldn&rsquo;t be assumed
without argument that quantifier words are objectual, i.e. range over
an associated domain of entities (Prior 1971: 31&ndash;4). Williamson
argues in particular that that the truth maker principle in fact
involves irreducible quantification into sentence position and
&lsquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t assume that quantification into sentence
position is objectual &lsquo;For &ldquo;value&rdquo; is a noun, not a
sentence&rsquo; (1999: 263) So one might acknowledge the intuition
that there is some difference between the circumstances in which a
proposition is true and the circumstances in which it is false but
without our having to think that there exists something that
we&rsquo;ve quantified over that makes it so.</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s another logical presupposition made by Armstrong and
other proponents of truthmakers that&rsquo;s relevant here. The use of
the truthmaking idiom is often conceived as equivalent to the use of a
non-causal &lsquo;because&rsquo;. So saying: <em>S</em> is made
true by <em>T</em>, is equivalent to saying: <em>S</em> is true
<em>because</em> <em>T</em> exists. The logical presupposition made by
Armstrong <em>et al</em> is that the relevant use of
&lsquo;because&rsquo; expresses a relation between a truthbearer and
some worldly item, a fact or a trope. But this presupposition is
challenged by philosophers who hold that &ldquo;because&rdquo;
so-employed is a connective conceived on the model of logical
operators (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&sim;&rdquo; etc.) i.e., as an
expressions that link sentences but without expressing a relation
between things picked out by those sentences. But, they reason, if
&lsquo;because&rsquo; is connective then so is the &lsquo;makes
true&rsquo; construction because they are equivalent. But then, they
reason, there&rsquo;s no need to introduce truth-makers as items that
stand at one end of the <em>truth-makingof</em> relation with true
statements at the other, no need to because it&rsquo;s only
superficial features of the grammar of our language that suggest there
is a truth-making relation to stand at the ends of. (K&uuml;nne 2003:
150&ndash;; Hornsby 2005: 35&ndash;7; Melia 2005: 78&ndash;9;
Schnieder 2006a: 29&ndash;37; Mulligan 2007).</p>

<p>
Typically philosophers who maintain that &ldquo;makes true&rdquo; is a
connective do not argue for this conclusion directly but encourage us
to dwell upon the fact that it natural to hear the
&ldquo;because&rdquo; that occurs in equivalent constructions as a
connective. When we hear, e.g., &ldquo;It is true that the rose is red
because the rose is red&rdquo; we don&rsquo;t naturally hear it as
expressing a binary relation between two things. So we shouldn&rsquo;t
hear, or at least don&rsquo;t have to hear, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true
that the rose is red in virtue of the rose&rsquo;s being red&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the rose&rsquo;s being red makes it true that the rose is
red&rdquo; as a expressing a binary relation between a truth and
truth-maker either. K&uuml;nne has gone further and suggested that the
truth-making connective is really the &ldquo;because&rdquo; of
conceptual explanation (2003: 154&ndash;5; Schnieder 2006a:
36&ndash;7). He hears the equivalence between,</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(<em>R</em>)</dt>
<dd>He is a child of a sibling of one of your parents, which makes him
your first cousin</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and,</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(<em>R*</em>)</dt>
<dd>He is your first cousin because he is a child of a sibling of one
of your parents.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
K&uuml;nne tells us that the &ldquo;because&rdquo; in (<em>R*</em>) is
the &ldquo;because&rdquo; of &ldquo;conceptual explanation&rdquo;.
Since (<em>R</em>) and (<em>R*</em>) are equivalent, he concludes that
the &ldquo;makes&rdquo; construction in (<em>R</em>) is just a
cumbersome way of expressing the &ldquo;because&rdquo; of conceptual
explanation in (<em>R*)</em>. K&uuml;nne then invites us take the use
of &ldquo;makes&rdquo; in (<em>R</em>) as a model for understanding
the truth-making construction,</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(<em>S</em>)</dt>
<dd>The fact that snow is white makes the statement that snow is white
true.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This enables us to see that (<em>S</em>) does &ldquo;not affirm a
relation of any kind between a truth vehicle and something in the
world&rdquo; (K&uuml;nne 2003: 155). Why? Because it is equivalent
to,</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(<em>S*</em>)</dt>
<dd>The statement that snow is white is true because snow is
white.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
a claim that makes no (explicit) mention of facts.</p>

<p>
Does all this mean that we should join Bigelow in his retreat to
(<em>Truth Supervenes Upon Being</em>) or step back with Lewis to
(<em>Subject Matter</em>)? The problem is that these supervenience
principles don&rsquo;t seem a satisfactory resting place either, not
if our concern is to understand how true representations can touch
upon an independent reality, i.e., something non-representational.
First, it is familiar point that just appealing to a systematic
pattern of modal co-variation between truths and their subject
matters&mdash;so that there is no difference in the former without a
difference in the latter&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t provide us within any
insight into the underlying mechanism or mechanisms that sustains this
dependency (Molnar 2000: 82&ndash;3; Heil 2003: 67; Daly 2005:
97&ndash;8; Melia 2005: 82&ndash;3). Second, if possible worlds are
conceived as maximal representations then these supervenience
principles (understood in the idiom of possible worlds) fail to
articulate what it is for a representation to touch upon being,
something non-representational: &ldquo;For the idea that every truth
<em>depends on being</em> is not the idea that every truth is
<em>entailed by propositions of a certain sort</em>&rdquo; (Merricks
2007: 86).</p>

<p>
A third reason for being unsatisfied with Lewis&rsquo; (<em>Subject
Matter</em>) is based upon the observation that the supervenience
involved is symmetric. Just as there is no difference in the
distribution of truth-values amongst the body of propositions without
a reciprocating difference in their subject matter, there is no
difference in their subject matter without a difference in the
distribution of their truth-values (Armstrong 2004: 7&ndash;8). But we
also have the firm intuition that the truth or falsity of a
proposition depends upon the state of the world in a way in which the
state of the world doesn&rsquo;t depend upon the proposition&rsquo;s
truth or falsity. This means that a supervenience principle like
(<em>Subject Matter</em>) cannot be used to articulate the asymmetric
way in which truth so depends upon being; for this, it is argued, we
need to rely upon a robust asymmetric notion of truth-making
(Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005: 18&ndash;19). Bricker (2015: 180&ndash;183)
replies on Lewis&rsquo;s behalf that the oft-heard complaint that
supervenience by itself is not a dependence or ontological priority
relation is besides the point. Rather, Bricker argues, the
metaphysical punch of Lewis&rsquo;s doctrine that truth supervenes
upon being &ldquo;has little to do with the &lsquo;supervenience
part&rsquo; and everything to do with the &lsquo;being&rsquo; part and
the conception of fundamentality that informs it&rdquo;, where by
&lsquo;fundamental&rsquo; Bricker means Lewis&rsquo;s theory of
natural properties and relations.</p>

<p>
But is there really anything so mysterious about the asymmetric
dependence of truth upon being that we need anything as heavy duty as
truth-making or supervenience+naturalness to explain it? A number of
proposals have been made for explaining the felt asymmetry in other
terms. Horwich (1998: 105; 2008: 265&ndash;66) argues that asymmetric
dependence of truth upon being arises from the fact that we can deduce
<em>p</em> from the proposition that <em>p is true</em>. But we can
equally deduce <em>p</em> from <em>p is true</em> so this fails to
establish an asymmetric dependence (K&uuml;nne 2003: 151&ndash;52;
Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005: 27).</p>

<p>
Hornsby argues instead that there is explanatory asymmetry between its
being the case that <em>p</em> and the proposition that <em>p is
true</em>, because the latter requires more to be the case than the
former, (e.g.) that there are propositions (Hornsby 2005: 44). Dodd
suggests a cognate alternative: that the felt asymmetry of truth upon
being arises from the fact that the identity of the proposition that p
is partially determined by the worldly items it&rsquo;s about, so we
can&rsquo;t understand what is required for the proposition that
<em>p</em> to be true without already having an understanding of what
it is for <em>p</em> to be the case (Dodd 2007: 398&ndash;400). More
radically, Tallant (2018) seeks to entirely replace truthmaker theory
with explanatory considerations: every truth is explained without
appeal to any truthmaker: &lt;p&gt; is true because p and &lt;p&gt; is
true iff p.</p>

<p>
MacBride (2014) offers a semantic account of the felt asymmetry in
terms of the interlocking mechanism of reference and satisfaction that
explains the truth of a proposition. Whilst we can deduce from the
truth of the proposition that <em>p</em> that <em>p</em> is the case,
MacBride argues that we can&rsquo;t (ultimately) explain its being the
case that <em>p</em> in terms of the truth of the proposition that
<em>p</em> because its being the case that <em>p</em> is already
assumed by the truth of that proposition, that is, has already
performed a role in the semantic mechanism whereby the truth-value is
determined. By contrast, its being the case that <em>p</em>
isn&rsquo;t determined by a semantic mechanism but by whatever worldly
factors, if any, that gave rise to <em>p</em>&rsquo;s being the case.
Saenz (2018) replies that whilst reference and satisfaction may be
used to explain that propositions are true, they still &ldquo;do not,
in any sense, account for the world &lsquo;making it&rsquo;
[<em>sic</em>] that propositions are some way&rdquo; (a similar point
is made by Mulligan et al 1984: 288, see sec. 3.5 below for further
discussion). But Saenz risks begging the question by making the
additional demand on the character of the felt asymmetry of truth and
being that it consists in more than an asymmetric relationship between
truth and being. Saenz holds that the felt asymmetry consists in the
requirement that the world makes propositions true but whether we need
to appeal to the idea of the world making propositions true in the
first place is the point at issue. Finally, Liggins (2012) argues that
the felt asymmetry between truth and being is best explained in terms
of the asymmetry of grounding, although the asymmetry of grounding is
contested as is grounding itself.</p>

<h3 id="TruCorDef">3.3 Truth: Correspondence and Deflationism</h3>

<p>
An alternative motivation for adopting the truth-maker principle is
that it inherits whatever the attractions where for the correspondence
theory of truth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Anybody who is attracted to the correspondence theory of truth should
be drawn to the truth-maker [<em>sic</em>]. Correspondence demands a
correspondent, and a correspondent for a truth is a truth-maker.
(Armstrong 1997: 14; see also 1997: 128&ndash;9, 2004: 16&ndash;7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Armstrong, the &ldquo;truth-maker principle&rdquo; (aka
maximalism) just is what we are left with once we drop the assumption
from the correspondence theory that the relation between truth bearers
and truth-makers is one-one. Of course, the truth-making relation,
however it is explicated, cannot be the relation of correspondence in
terms of which <em>truth</em> is defined&mdash;for whereas the latter
is symmetric, the former isn&rsquo;t (Beebee &amp; Dodd 2005b:
13&ndash;4). But this doesn&rsquo;t prevent truth being defined using
the <em>truth-making</em> relation, albeit in a more roundabout way
according to the following pattern,</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt>(C)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> is true &hArr; (&exist;<em>x</em>)(<em>S</em>
is-made-true-by <em>x</em>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Of course such a definition will only succeed if the relation
expressed by &ldquo;is-made-true-by&rdquo; can itself be explicated
without relying upon the notion of <em>truth</em> itself or other
notions that implicitly presuppose it, e.g., entailment (Merricks
2007: 15). This is no doubt one of the reasons that principles of
truth-making are typically not put forward as definitions of truth
(David 2009: 144). Another objection made by Horwich is that it is
implausible to suppose that an ordinary person understands the notion
of truth <em>via</em> the heterogeneous principles that govern the
provision of truth-makers for different types of propositions.
It&rsquo;s more plausible to suppose that we first grasp what truth
is, and only subsequently figure out what truth-makers are required
for the various kinds of propositions there are (Horwich 2009:
188).</p>

<p>
Several philosophers have argued that the kinds of truthmaking we have
been considering don&rsquo;t presuppose the notion of <em>truth</em>
but operate at a far more subterranean level. Bigelow writes,
&ldquo;The force behind Truth-maker lies deeper than worries about the
nature of truth and of truth-bearers&rdquo; (Bigelow 1988: 127, 2009:
396&ndash;7; Robinson 2000: 152; Lewis 2001: 605&ndash;6; Horwich
2009: 188&ndash;9, Bricker 2015: 169). Here&rsquo;s their reasoning.
Suppose we understand what it is to be truth-maker in terms of
entailment. Then whatever the range of truths we think are capable of
being rendered true, the &ldquo;guts&rdquo; of our truth-maker
principle can be stated using the schema,</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Schema</em>)</dt>
<dd>If <em>P</em>, then there must be something in the world whose
existence entails that <em>P</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This schema is equivalent to the infinitely many conditionals that
fall under it:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em-right">
<dt>(<em>i</em>1)</dt>
<dd>If the donkey is brown, then there must be something in the world
whose existence entails that the donkey is brown;</dd>
<dt>(<em>i</em>2)</dt>
<dd>if the Parthenon is on the Acropolis then there must be something
in the world whose existence entails that the Parthenon is on the
Acropolis; and so on.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note that neither &ldquo;true&rdquo; nor &ldquo;truth&rdquo; shows up
anywhere in the schema or its instances. Arguably the only role that
the notion of <em>truth</em> perform<em>s</em> is the one that
minimalist or deflationary theories of truth emphasize, that of
enabling us to capture all of that unending string of conditionals in
a single slogan,</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt>(<em>Slogan</em>)</dt>
<dd>For <em>any truth</em>, there must be something in the world whose
existence entails <em>that truth</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But since truth is serving here <em>only</em> as a device of
generalization, the real subject matter of (<em>Slogan</em>) is
already expressed by the conditionals (<em>i</em>1), (<em>i2</em>)
<em>etc</em>. Since they make no explicit mention of either
propositions or truth, a theory of truth-makers is neither a theory
about propositions nor a theory about truth. If so, then the theory of
truth-makers can neither gain inspiration from, nor be tarred by the
same brush as the correspondence theory of truth. Nor need the theory
of truth-makers be bedeviled by concerns about the nature of truth
bearers.</p>

<p>
One may nevertheless wonder whether Bigelow and Lewis have thrown the
baby out with the bathwater. MacBride (2013a) argues that if we do not
allow ourselves the general thought that truth-bearers are true or
false depending upon how things stand in the world then it is unclear
what, if any, credibility (<em>i1</em>), (<em>i2</em>) etc. have. For
why should there be something in the world whose existence
necessitates that (e.g.) cats purr? Why can&rsquo;t cats purr, even
though there is nothing whose existence entails that truth? Since
<em>Slogan</em> is intended to be just shorthand for its instances,
(<em>i</em> 1), (<em>i</em> 2) etc. it follows <em>Slogan</em>
can&rsquo;t be any more credible or motivated than its instances. If,
however, we allow ourselves a conception of truth which isn&rsquo;t
deflationary, i.e. a substantial conception whereby truth is conceived
as a relation borne by a truth-bearer to something worldly that exists
independently of us, then, MacBride argues, we will have an
independent reason for positing something worldly the existence of
which necessitates the truth that cats purr etc.</p>

<p>
Asay draws another connection with minimalism or deflationary theories
of truth. He argues that truthmaking should not be used in the service
of defining truth because, &ldquo;As on deflationary accounts (e.g.,
Horwich 1998), it may be that all there is to the property of truth is
that it is the property that a sentence &lsquo;p&rsquo; has if and
only if p&rdquo; (2023: 14). But, as Alston (1996: 37&ndash;8)
thought, some kind of deflationism might be the correct theory of the
concept of truth, whilst leaving open the possibility that there is
more to be said about the property of truth than the concept of truth
supplies&mdash;which truthmaking might supply. Moreover, unless Asay thinks
the truthmaker principle analytically follows from minimalism about
truth, he is committed to saying that, at least in many instances,
there is more to be said about the property of truth than what Horwich
allows. (For further discussion of deflationism in connection with
truth-making see McGrath 2003, Vision 2005 and Thomas 2011).</p>
