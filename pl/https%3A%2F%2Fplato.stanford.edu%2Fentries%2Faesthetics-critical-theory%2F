<h1>Aesthetics in Critical Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Mar 25, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Critical theory arose as a response to perceived inadequacies in
Marxist theory, and perceived changes in modern capitalism. Critical
theorists emphasized the ability of capitalism to shape the thought
and experience of individuals: it distorts how modern society and its
products appear to us, and how we think about them. So, aesthetic
experience &ndash; like all other experience &ndash; is moulded to and
compromised by capitalism. For critical theory, if we seek to
understand aesthetics we need to acknowledge this distorting
effect.</p>

<p>
Critical theorists ask us to pay attention to how art, and aesthetic
experience, suffer under capitalism, and become part of the way in
which capitalism prevents the formation of a better life. They argue
that art at all levels is succumbing to commodification &ndash; which
is to say, is increasingly conforming to the demands of making
profitable products, rather than the demands of producing good art.
For critical theorists, commodification brings with it standardization
and external influence incompatible with genuine artistic achievement.
This concern applies both to popular culture and &lsquo;high&rsquo;
culture, although in different ways.</p>

<p>
For critical theory, aesthetics and art are thus part of the wrong
state of things: the world pervasively formed by instrumental reason,
reification, and ideology. As a result, genuine art, and aesthetic
experience, are increasingly being made less possible in capitalist
society &ndash; as are uncompromised thought and life more
generally.</p>

<p>
However, critical theory also recommends art and aesthetic experience
as part of the potential solution to this wrong state of things.
Artworks and aesthetic experiences can overturn the delusive effects
of capitalism, and disclose the genuine, changeable, nature of things.
Through formal rigour and imaginative openness, art can expose
contradictions, suppressed phenomena, and produce representations of
alternative ways of living. Art&rsquo;s liberating properties are thus
aligned with formal experimentation.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="His">1. History</h2>

<p>
As noted in the separate entry,
 <a href="../critical-theory/">critical theory</a>
 can be thought of narrowly or broadly. Thought of broadly,
&lsquo;critical theory&rsquo; picks out philosophical work which
combines a moral-political conviction that human flourishing is
presently blocked, and a methodological conviction that interrogation
of prevailing norms, practices, and concepts is necessary (but perhaps
insufficient) to remove this blockage. Thought of narrowly,
&lsquo;critical theory&rsquo; picks out a specific area of philosophy
animated by these twin convictions &ndash; the work of philosophers
associated with the Frankfurt <em>Institut f&uuml;r
Sozialforschung</em> (Institute for Social Research). This group is
often referred to as the &lsquo;Frankfurt School&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
This entry will use &lsquo;critical theory&rsquo; in the narrow sense.
This entry will be further narrowed by focusing almost exclusively on
the first generation of the Frankfurt School. For economy, I will use
&lsquo;critical theory&rsquo; as shorthand for the more unwieldy
&lsquo;first-generation critical theory&rsquo;. Closely related
figures &ndash; like Walter Benjamin (1892&ndash;1940) and Ernst Bloch
(1885&ndash;1977) &ndash; will not be collected under this phrase, but
explicitly picked out as and when they are relevant.</p>

<p>
The Frankfurt School is often spoken of as having three generations.
Core figures in the first generation include Max Horkheimer
(1895&ndash;1973), Theodor Adorno (1903&ndash;1969), and Herbert
Marcuse (1898&ndash;1979). Horkheimer, who would become a close
collaborator with Adorno, took directorship of the Institute in 1930.
The Institute was closed by the Nazis in 1933. Horkheimer was
instrumental in relocating and re-starting the Institute, eventually
settling in America in 1934. Adorno and Marcuse followed. The most
famous of their works would be <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>
(Adorno &amp; Horkheimer 1944 [2002]), <em>One-Dimensional Man</em>
(Marcuse 1964), and <em>Negative Dialectics</em> (Adorno 1966 [2006]).
As important as this American context &ndash; and exposure to American
popular culture &ndash; would be to their aesthetics, so too was the
German cultural milieu of the 1920s and 1930s. For example, before
joining the Institute Adorno had studied musical composition with the
atonal composer Alban Berg (later commemorated in Adorno&rsquo;s
<em>Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link</em>, 1968 [1991]),
befriended philosopher and critic Siegfried Kracauer, and written
musical criticism for the journal, <em>Musikbl&auml;tter des
Anbruch</em> (Claussen 2008: 52&ndash;56, 102&ndash;106, 152). Walter
Benjamin&rsquo;s ideas were broadly disseminated via his friendship
with Adorno (for more on their relationship, including with respect to
aesthetics, see Rosen 2004, Buck-Morss 1977 &amp; 1991, Nicholsen
1997b). The ideas of Georg Luk&aacute;cs and Ernst Bloch were also
influential on the first-generation critical theorists, as we will
see.</p>

<p>
The second and third generations of critical theory are roughly marked
by the coming to prominence of J&uuml;rgen Habermas (1929&ndash;) and
Axel Honneth (1949&ndash;), respectively. The three generations are
not merely distinguished by their personnel. There are important
theoretical differences. The <em>Cambridge Habermas Lexicon</em>
begins its &lsquo;Aesthetics&rsquo; entry (Duvenage 2019) with the
statement that &lsquo;Whereas aesthetics plays an important role among
the thinkers of the first generation &hellip; this is not so for
Habermas.&rsquo;&rsquo; (For an opposing view of Habermas&rsquo;
relationship to aesthetics, however, see Duvenage 2003, McMahon 2011,
Mackin 2022.) Honneth seldom mentions aesthetics (though see Honneth
2007). While there are valuable remarks on aesthetics in the work of
both, then, they do not obviously belong in a discussion of the
characteristic shape of the interface between critical theory and
aesthetics. Critical theory&rsquo;s distinctive treatment of
aesthetics is thus confined largely to the first generation.</p>

<h2 id="WhyDoeCriTheHavAes">2. Why Does Critical Theory Have an Aesthetics?</h2>

<p>
In 1937&rsquo;s &lsquo;Traditional and Critical Theory&rsquo;
Horkheimer offers the following statement about the programme he and
his colleagues pursue, and its moral urgency &ndash;</p>

<blockquote>
If activity governed by reason is proper to man, then existent social
practice, which forms the individual&rsquo;s life down to its least
details, is inhuman, and this inhumanity affects everything that goes
on in the society &hellip;. The goal at which the [critical theorist]
aims, namely the rational state of society, is forced upon him by
present distress &hellip; It is the task of the critical theoretician
to reduce the tension between his own insight and oppressed humanity
in whose service he thinks &hellip;. (Horkheimer 1937 [2002: 210, 217,
221])
</blockquote>

<p>
It is not surprising that this approach produced books with titles
like <em>Eclipse of Reason</em> (Horkheimer 1947), <em>One-Dimensional
Man</em> (Marcuse 1964) or <em>Prophets of Deceit</em> (Lowenthal
&amp; Guterman 1949). But the emergence of books with titles like
<em>Aesthetic Theory</em> (Adorno 1970 [2004]), or <em>The Aesthetic
Dimension</em> (Marcuse 1978) is perhaps harder to anticipate. Given
the nature of critical theory, and its urgent pursuit of concrete
improvement in people&rsquo;s material and social lives, one might
wonder why critical theory has an aesthetics at all.</p>

<p>
One answer is that &lsquo;critical theory&rsquo; has no need for an
aesthetics. Its practitioners simply happened to like to think about
art and did so. It is certainly true that many of the members of the
first generation had biographical connections to, or a pre-established
interest in, the world of art. But critical theory has an aesthetics
for theoretical, not biographical, reasons. To make these reasons
clear we need to take a detour through the work of Karl Marx
(1818&ndash;1883), and then Georg Luk&aacute;cs (1885&ndash;1971).</p>

<h3 id="ComFet">2.1 Commodity Fetishism</h3>

<p>
Critical theory is grounded in a very particular approach to Marx,
which emphasizes capitalism&rsquo;s power to determine the world of
individual thought and experience (see Kautzer 2017). This approach
rests on a keen interest in commodity fetishism, a phenomenon which
Marx discusses relatively briefly in volume one of
<em>Capital</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
A commodity is &hellip; a mysterious thing, simply because in it the
social character of men&rsquo;s labour appears to them as an objective
character stamped upon the product of that labour; because the
relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is
presented to them as a social relation, existing not between
themselves, but between the products of their labour. This is the
reason why the products of labour become commodities, social things
&hellip;. This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to the
products of labour, so soon as they are produced as commodities, and
which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.
(Marx 1867 [1932: 83])
</blockquote>

<p>
For Marx, commodity fetishism is an effect produced by the objective
structure of social exchange. The buying and selling of goods draws
equivalences between the goods exchanged. But this equivalence is
performed not by comparing the labour time expended on those goods,
but by comparing what appear to be properties of the commodities
themselves. Price indices are driven by social facts about exchange
and production; but these social facts vanish from view, and the
prices themselves appear to be properties of objects. (&ldquo;This
gold bar is worth &pound;__, and thus equivalent in value to 1,000
coats, 2,000 bricks and so on&rdquo; &ndash; not &ldquo;The socially
necessary labour time involved in gold mining is such that a gold
bar&rsquo;s exchange value is expressed as &hellip;&rdquo;). Capitalism
thus presents itself as natural. This conceals the fact that exchange
value arises not from the nature of things, but rather from the way we
organize our labour. In turn, this conceals the fact that the way we
organize our labour is not natural but in fact open to change.</p>

<p>
On Marx&rsquo;s account commodity fetishism affects the way in which
we experience, and therefore theorize about, the social world. It
conceals the true nature of capitalism. This concealment can be
understood as something like an optical illusion. Marx uses the
instructive analogy of the appearance of air:</p>

<blockquote>
The recent scientific discovery, that the products of labour, so far
as they are values, are but material expressions of the human labour
&hellip; by no means, dissipates the mist through which the social
character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the
products themselves &hellip;. [T]his fact appears to the
producers &hellip; to be just as real and final, as the fact, that,
after the discovery by science of the component gases of air, the
atmosphere itself remained unaltered. (Marx 1867 [1932: 85&ndash;86])
</blockquote>

<p>
While the appearance of air &ndash; or of commodities &ndash; is not
altered by our coming into scientific knowledge of their true
constitution, the fact remains that we can and have acquired this
knowledge in spite of that appearance. Thus, for Marx all that is
needed to &lsquo;see through&rsquo; commodity fetishism is to employ
reason to enquire into what lies beneath the apparent nature of
capitalism.</p>

<h3 id="Rei">2.2 Reification</h3>

<p>
Luk&aacute;cs&rsquo; most influential work, <em>History and Class
Consciousness</em> (1923), extends and revises Marx&rsquo;s analysis
of commodity fetishism. Unlike Marx, Luk&aacute;cs does not see
capitalism as merely presenting a misleading appearance (as an optical
illusion might) but exerting an effect on our very way of thinking and
perceiving altogether (as a hallucination or delusion might).
Accordingly, Luk&aacute;cs held commodity fetishism to have a systemic
and general influence on consciousness. He used the term
&lsquo;<em>Verdinglichung</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;reification&rsquo; to
name the broader effects he saw as stemming from commodity fetishism.
Reification covers not only thought about or adjacent to the economy,
but thought <em>in general</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
In the process we witness, illuminatingly, how here, too, the
<em>contemplative</em> nature of man under capitalism makes its
appearance &hellip; all issues are subjected to an increasingly formal
and standardised treatment and in which there is an ever-increasing
remoteness from the qualitative and material essence of the
&lsquo;things&rsquo; to which bureaucratic activity pertains.
(Luk&aacute;cs 1923 [1971a: 97&ndash;99])
</blockquote>

<p>
The richness and unpredictability of the world is glossed over by a
form of thought which presumes complete agreement between abstract
concepts and particular things. And this narrowing of thought is
replicated in a narrowing of experience. Reification as a form of
thought is grounded in and enforced by a broader tendency towards
standardization which capitalism carries with it, from commodification
(the increasing tendency to convert goods into products produced for
exchange in line with the demands of the market), to bureaucratization
(the administration of the social world according to inflexible
rules), and so on. The claim, then, is that under capitalism we come
to conceive of and experience the world in terms of general
categories.</p>

<p>
This is a problem because these general categories are, it is claimed,
overly restrictive. The world has properties (causal, moral, and
functional) which are not captured by these categories, and hence are
excluded from reified thought and reified experience. Facts which
might undermine the present social order (the exploitation integral to
capitalist production, for example) are excluded from thought and
experience. This also has moral implications. General moral and
political categories (like &lsquo;citizen&rsquo;, &lsquo;human&rsquo;,
&lsquo;worker&rsquo;, and so on) will tend towards excluding persons
who do not conform to the restrictive standards these categories come
with.</p>

<p>
The idea of reification &ndash; if we hope to overcome it, or indeed
to explain our ability to perceive it &ndash; requires us to posit
some counter-reifying force. For Luk&aacute;cs, it is the proletariat
(working class) that are (potentially) this force. The proletariat
need only realize the exploitative nature of capitalist production and
recognize that they have the power to change this process. The
proletariat are necessarily always on the brink of this realization,
in Luk&aacute;cs&rsquo; view, as their working conditions are
intrinsically counter-reifying. They themselves are the contingent
human labour which is concealed by the apparently natural and
necessary world of capitalism and commodities.</p>

<h3 id="CriTheAccRei">2.3 Critical Theory&rsquo;s Account of Reification</h3>

<p>
While Luk&aacute;cs&rsquo; account of reification exerted great
influence on the Frankfurt School (see Feenberg 2017, Kavoulakos
2017), the proletarian strand of his thought did not. Returning to
Horkheimer&rsquo;s seminal &ldquo;Traditional and Critical
Theory&rdquo; we find the following remark:</p>

<blockquote>
But it must be added that even the situation of the proletariat is, in
this society, no guarantee of correct knowledge. &hellip; Even to the
proletariat the world superficially seems quite different than it
really is (Horkheimer 1937 [2002: 213&ndash;214]).
</blockquote>

<p>
This leaves critical theory in a difficult position. If reification is
total, and counter-reifying forces are totally absent, then
Horkheimer&rsquo;s claim to be thinking in &lsquo;service of&rsquo;
those oppressed by capitalism is incoherent. Critical theory requires
a counter-reifying force to explain how it can perceive and see beyond
the epistemic errors produced by reification.</p>

<p>
For Marx, commodity fetishism was a problem with the comprehension of
labour, which could be solved either through reading more accurate
literature about labour (hence the writing of <em>Capital</em>), or
better acquainting oneself with the reality of the production process
(hence Marx&rsquo;s ability to write <em>Capital</em>). Luk&aacute;cs
appears to identify revolutionary proletarian consciousness as the
means to undo the effects of reification, although the mechanics of
its formation are not entirely clear. For critical theory, by
contrast, commodity fetishism and reification are not problems which
can be overcome by modifying either the content of experience (by
reading <em>Capital</em>, say) or the social position of the
experiencer. One can learn as much as possible about the conditions of
the working class, and be as close to the production process as one
likes, but reification will still obtain.</p>

<p>
For critical theory, reification is a problem with the very form of
experience itself; and the solution to reification will come through
processes which can engage and manipulate that form of experience.
Thus, for critical theory reification is an aesthetic problem in its
original and broadest sense: as concerned with the realm of sensible
experience.</p>

<p>
Critical theory&rsquo;s task will be to find avenues which can disrupt
the influence of reification and make the genuine state of things
&ndash; and the genuine possibilities for change &ndash; open to
thought and experience. Several avenues for producing this effect were
explored, but chief among them was art, and aesthetic experience.</p>

<h2 id="ProCom">3. The Problem of Commodification</h2>

<p>
Luk&aacute;cs, whose early work had been so influential on Critical
theory, later became much closer to Soviet orthodoxy, even to the
extent that he repudiated his earlier work on reification. He also
broke with his earlier, equally influential, work on aesthetics (like
1910&rsquo;s <em>Soul and Form</em>). Here too Luk&aacute;cs moved
into closer alignment with Soviet thought. The Soviet art movement
known as Socialist realism explicitly thematized concrete social and
political factors in art, in order to instil a correct understanding
of them in the art appreciator. Luk&aacute;cs was not uncritical of
the actual implementation of this movement, especially under Stalin
(Luk&aacute;cs 1971b: 116&ndash;130), and nor does he deny the quality
and power of the &lsquo;critical realists&rsquo; who likewise include
concrete historical detail, but without explicit socialist ideology
(Luk&aacute;cs 1971b, chapters 2 and 3). But above all it is realism
in opposition to the &lsquo;decadent formalism&rsquo; (Luk&aacute;cs
1971b: 133&ndash;135) of modernism that Luk&aacute;cs urged as best
serving the moral and political aims of Marxism.</p>

<p>
Adorno, Marcuse, and Benjamin, by contrast, found their favourite
examples of the liberating power of art in multiple schools and time
periods, including modernism, nearly all of which refused any overt
political content. They also openly questioned the efficacy and
quality of much political art (see, e.g., Marcuse 1978: 19; 33&ndash;39,
Schoolman 1976: 58&ndash;60, Klassen &amp; Blumenfeld 2018, Adorno
1961 [1977a], 1977b). This rejection was seen by many, including the
later Luk&aacute;cs, as evidence of elitism, political disengagement,
and immoral indifference to the world at large (see Zuidervaart 1994:
28&ndash;44 for an overview).</p>

<p>
However, critical theory&rsquo;s rejection of &lsquo;politically
engaged&rsquo; art is not driven by disagreement with the politics of
such artworks. Rather, it stems from an apparently apolitical
disagreement about the necessary and appropriate relationship between
content and form. critical theory generally emphasizes the primacy of
form in explaining both art&rsquo;s achievement and its
counter-reifying effects (see Hartle 2018 for an overview of the
development of this position). The demands of such formal success are
(it is claimed) incompatible with direct political engagement. To
clarify this, we need to look more closely at what form and content
mean in this context.</p>

<h3 id="ForCon">3.1 Form and Content</h3>

<p>
For critical theory, aesthetic value is reducible neither to form nor
content. A complex relationship between the two is at the core of
critical theory&rsquo;s aesthetics. It is claimed that form and
content are inextricable and mutually informing. But here again, we
should not confuse this with more familiar positions. The claim is not
that form and content are identical (as in A.C. Bradley&rsquo;s
infamous claim in 1909&rsquo;s <em>Oxford Lectures on Poetry</em>, or
Cleanth Brooks&rsquo; (1947: 192&ndash;215) &lsquo;Heresy of
Paraphrase&rsquo;). Rather, the claim most often advanced is that
content is converted into, or &lsquo;sedimented into&rsquo;, form
while still not becoming identical with it.</p>

<p>
This idea requires further explanation. When Marcuse and Adorno claim
that content is converted into form within art, they are best
understood <em>not</em> as advancing the claim that the surface themes
and content of the artwork are rendered formal, but as claiming that
the meaning of the artwork is expressed primarily by the formal
properties of the artwork.</p>

<p>
For example, while Kafka&rsquo;s <em>The Trial</em> has as its surface
content a story about a man who is subjected to an interminable and
senseless trial for an unknown crime, its true meaning (according to
Adorno) is an expression of certain features of capitalism (see
further O&rsquo;Connor 2013). This expression of its deeper meaning is
achieved through the texture and organization of the novel itself,
rather than in its apparent themes. Nowhere does <em>The Trial</em>
baldly state that capitalism has produced an absurd and inhuman form
of life. Nor, importantly, is it necessary that Kafka believed such a
thing. Critical theory&rsquo;s claim is that the truth of life under
capitalism is in some way communicated to the form of artworks
directly. (Some problems with this view are presented in section
3.3.)</p>

<p>
To see why content must be converted into form in this way for art to
be successful, and why this seemingly abstruse issue prevents critical
theorists from endorsing expressly political art, we need to look once
more at reification.</p>

<p>
The theory of reification claims that thought has taken on a
characteristically abstract and instrumental character. It is this
form of thought which ultimately underlies the persistence and dangers
of capitalism. Anything which can be assimilated by this form of
thought is rendered exchangeable and serves as evidence of the
appropriateness of that form of thought itself. This means that moral
or political claims in art can themselves become part of their
commodity value, and fail to disrupt the form of thought which caused
the moral or political injuries that motivated the art itself. The
dissenting novel, music, or film is something which for all its
sincerity is still offered alongside all the others, and whose mode of
delivery and consumption replicates, and vindicates, the very form of
exchange &ndash; and hence consciousness &ndash; it seeks to
undermine.</p>

<h3 id="AvoCom">3.2 Avoiding Commodification</h3>

<p>
If art is able to show a form of life and thought outside of
capitalism, then it must resist absorption by the characteristic
structure of capitalism. Via Marx, critical theorists see the
characteristic structure of capitalism as commodity exchange.
Commodity exchange has the characteristic function of rendering
objects perfectly exchangeable by assigning them monetary value. Via
Luk&aacute;cs, critical theorists see commodity exchange also having a
characteristic, reified kind of experience and thought &ndash; that
which sees objects as all conforming to general laws, concepts, and
types.</p>

<p>
From this, we see that successful art must resist being easily turned
into a generic commodity, and must also resist being formed by and
wholly comprehensible through pre-set types. In art&rsquo;s case,
these pre-set types would include compositional conventions, cliches,
platitudes and the like.</p>

<p>
These are structural reasons why art must resist easy adoption by the
market (and, in turn, audiences). It must also resist easy adoption to
avoid contradicting its own meaning. If art is aimed against
exchangeability and clich&eacute;, then it must also be aimed against
having its content easily converted into products and
clich&eacute;s.</p>

<p>
This is why form is primary in understanding art&rsquo;s ability to
undo the effects of reification. It is only through the
problematization of the relationship between form and content, and art
and its consumption, that the meaning of an artwork can be protected
from commodification and nullification. Art is obliged to ceaselessly
formally innovate, and to ceaselessly reject pre-set established
compositional norms.</p>

<p>
In this way, art&rsquo;s meaning &ndash; its critical relationship to
capitalism &ndash; is communicated in its form, and not in its
explicit subject matter. Artworks avoid baldly stating claims about
the inhumanity of contemporary society &ndash; these could become
slogans; be resold and defused &ndash; and instead show it through
their challenging formal organization.</p>

<p>
How, exactly, this critical content becomes converted into formal
properties is not clear. Nor is it clear how broad social problems
come to be encapsulated in specific artworks authored by specific
artists. This is a problem which critical theory never fully mastered.
In Adorno&rsquo;s work, there is no suggestion that this formalization
of content is a product of the artist&rsquo;s conscious or
subconscious intention. Rather, the process is &lsquo;blind&rsquo;,
and the social content enters the artwork, and creative process, not
as thematic content but as formal problems with which the artist is
faced (see Hulatt 2016a).</p>

<p>
Marcuse (1978: 14&ndash;15), for his part, likewise emphasizes the
migration of social content into form, and notes that it is a central
perplexity in Marxist aesthetics. In a move which mirrors
Adorno&rsquo;s attempt to see social problems as translated into
artistic problems, Marcuse (1978: 41) explains this migration partly
in terms of the social preformation of the meaning of artistic
materials. The very stuff out of which art is made (&lsquo;word,
colour, tone&rsquo;) carries socially encoded meanings, expectations
and conventions. This &lsquo;limitation of aesthetic autonomy&rsquo;,
he writes, &lsquo;is the condition under which art can become a social
factor&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Unlike Adorno, however, Marcuse also sees art as a repository of
&lsquo;transhistorical&rsquo; truths and features. These relate both
to certain core definitional features of art and aesthetic response
(Marcuse 1978: 15&ndash;16) and to core features of the
transhistorical &lsquo;species being&rsquo; he sees as underlying
human experience (Marcuse 1978: 29). Marcuse introduces these
non-historicist elements in order to rule out a reductive Marxist
account which would claim that art&rsquo;s function, quality and
meaning is chained to its society and class position. Marcuse holds
that aesthetic properties cannot be so reducible, as this would render
our appreciation of artworks across epochs and economic systems
inexplicable. Further, it would nullify art&rsquo;s important ability
to speak beyond and outstrip contemporary ideals and norms.</p>

<p>
While for Adorno art&rsquo;s relationship to its social content was
thoroughly hostile &ndash; both in its defiance of contemporary norms,
and its demonstration of the revisability of those norms &ndash;
Marcuse offers a more variegated picture. Art critically engages with
and negates society, but also describes unrealized potentials for
improvement (see, e.g., Marcuse 2006: 140&ndash;149). This difference
between the two thinkers will be discussed further in section 4.</p>

<h3 id="PopCul">3.3 Popular Culture</h3>

<p>
Adorno and Horkheimer coined the phrase &lsquo;Culture Industry&rsquo;
in their jointly authored book <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>. It
was intended ironically, as an insulting oxymoron. This irony has been
overtaken by history. The music and film spheres, for example, proudly
refer to themselves as industries. This outcome illustrates, after a
fashion, the thesis and limits of critical theory&rsquo;s critique of
popular culture.</p>

<p>
To critical theory, culture is in a process of coming to an end. This
coming to an end is precipitated by ever-increasing strength of norms
of exchange and standardization (&lsquo;industry&rsquo;) in
controlling the production of art (&lsquo;culture&rsquo;) (see further
Hulatt 2016b). This thesis is developed in part sociologically,
through examination of the mechanics of radio transmission, the
nascent Hollywood system, the distribution and sale of records, and so
on. Empirical research into this claim was pursued in various ways,
including the Princeton Radio Research Project at which Adorno worked
once he arrived in America (see further Jenemann 2007).</p>

<p>
The thesis was also developed through aesthetic analysis of popular
culture itself. Critical theory found Western popular artforms
wanting, judging whole genres and media devoid of merit.
Adorno&rsquo;s criticisms of specific popular artworks were often
mordant and unsympathetic, and have had an outsize effect on
perception of critical theory&rsquo;s stance towards popular culture.
It can appear that critical theory simply rejects popular culture as
inferior, and seeks a return to the kind of high culture many critical
theorists enjoyed in fin-de-siecle Germany. Such snobbery would appear
particularly odd in supposedly radical Marxist philosophy. However,
the broader account of popular culture &ndash; its superiority to
&lsquo;high culture&rsquo; in some respects, and the tragedy of its
unrealized technical potential &ndash; is innovative and often
overlooked.</p>

<p>
In a 1936 letter to Benjamin, Adorno remarks that popular and
&lsquo;high&rsquo; art are &lsquo;two torn halves, which do not add up
to a whole&rsquo; (Adorno 1977c: 123). This remark conveys a number of
things which must be borne in mind. The existence of two separate
spheres of popular culture and high art is a reflection of the wrong
state of things &ndash; their opposition and polarization would not be
part of a good society. Both popular culture and high-art have
capacities and deficiencies which the other lacks &ndash; indeed, they
each form a mirror image of the other. However, these two spheres of
culture cannot be re-unified by sheer force of will &ndash; they do
not add up to a unified whole, because they have been objectively
driven apart by the nature of the social whole. (Marcuse 1965 takes a
similar view.)</p>

<p>
We see, then, that Adorno does not see popular culture as merely
coarse product. It in fact preserves properties key to art, and serves
as a rebuke to &lsquo;high&rsquo; culture. For example, popular music
is pleasant to listen to, and more or less immediately accessible.
This kind of accessibility and pleasure is part of what ideal art
would be &ndash; and it is part of the failure of modern art that it
has been forced to lose both its accessibility and its beauty. (We
will enter into the reasons why it suffers this loss momentarily.)
Adorno is also not blind to the economic injustices which govern the
world of high art &ndash; the leisure time and disposable income
necessary to acquire a taste in classical music for example.</p>

<p>
Conversely, classical music has the virtue that it delivers on what it
promises &ndash; genuine novelty, pure aesthetic satisfaction and
formal achievement. By contrast, popular music promises novelty,
ungoverned satisfaction of impulses, and perhaps some associated
lifestyle, but is forced to repeatedly renege on these promises (see
for example Adorno&rsquo;s discussion of syncopation in Jazz, in
Lewandowski 1996). One way of putting Adorno&rsquo;s point is that
popular culture is not objectionable because it stimulates the
passions, but because it does not truly satisfy them (Rebentisch &amp;
Trautmann 2019: 22&ndash;23). This criticism is shared by Marcuse, who
sees increasingly permissive popular culture not as objectionable
<em>because</em> it is permissive (he is in favour of relaxed sexual
mores, for instance) but because it never delivers on its promise. For
Marcuse the release of emotions in cultural products &ndash; be they
sexual longing, political frustration, or repressed aggression &ndash;
is allowed just enough to ensure the popularity of the product, and
not explored in its full transformative power.</p>

<p>
This idea of reneging on promises also underwrites Adorno&rsquo;s
criticism of movements to popularize high culture. For example, Adorno
deeply objected to the transmission of performances of Beethoven over
the radio. This was not because Beethoven was too good for the public,
but because the technology involved was not good enough for the
public. The genuine experience of a live performance was being
replaced by a low resolution transmission &ndash; and the public were
invited to believe they had received the genuine article. (Or so
Adorno claims, Adorno 1945: 209&ndash;210.)</p>

<p>
This thread runs through critical theory&rsquo;s treatment of popular
culture &ndash; not a suspicion of popularity, accessibility, or
pleasurability, but a suspicion of the failure to genuinely provide
these things. Popular music and cinema promise excitement and novelty
&ndash; but in fact work according to pre-set schema. Popular media
promises to bring excitement of high culture into the home &ndash; but
in fact the transmission is poor, and incapable of properly conveying
what you wish to listen to. This is the mirror image of high
culture&rsquo;s failure. Quoting Brecht, Adorno notes that
culture&rsquo;s &lsquo;mansion is built out of dogshit&rsquo; (Adorno
2006: 366). By this he means that high culture is dependent on a
society whose inequality and inhumanity makes the better form of life
high art outlines ever more impossible. (For more on the role of
Brecht in Adorno&rsquo;s thought, see Rothe 2018.)</p>

<p>
Under capitalism, both high culture and popular culture are not good
enough for the public; not vice versa.</p>

<h2 id="AesExpAgaRei">4. Aesthetic Experience Against Reification</h2>

<p>
In section 3.2, the counter-reifying force of art was explained
negatively. The unusual formal organization of artworks serves to
protect their content from being nullified by the effects of
commodification and reification. But the position is not simply that
the artwork conceals its meaning such that it cannot be easily
commodified. It is that the meaning of the artwork in some fashion
breaks with and undermines the false consciousness it has been
protected against. Art is thus not merely defensively organized, but
aggressively organized also. It does not merely elude reification, but
actively combats it.</p>

<p>
This claim is one of the more vexed and complex elements of critical
theory&rsquo;s aesthetics. To anticipate, it will be the
subject&rsquo;s <em>experience</em> of the artwork which is held to
have this aggressive counter-reifying effect. That experience will be
elicited by the appreciator&rsquo;s active participation in attending
to the form/content organization of the artwork.</p>

<p>
The counter-reifying effect of art appears to be socio-historically
specific (it can be lost over time) and critical (the artwork appears
to indict and overturn certain pathologies of thought and social
organization). In this section we will look more closely at how
various critical theorists explain this view.</p>

<h3 id="ErnBlo">4.1 Ernst Bloch</h3>

<p>
We can find one source of this idea in the work of a contemporary,
Ernst Bloch, who had a marked influence on the Frankfurt School. Bloch
saw art as combining a faithful account of both the current state of
things, and of possibilities usually ignored. This is the
&lsquo;not-yet&rsquo; which Bloch saw as concealed by conventional
experience, but forcibly disclosed by the successful artwork (as well
as other cultural products &ndash; see Kellner and O&rsquo;Hara 1976).
The utopian aspect to the artwork &ndash; its representation of
another form of life &ndash; is in some sense fantastical and
imaginary. It is not a depiction of how things are, but a depiction of
how they genuinely might be. But in this way, art discloses the close
proximity of another way of ordering life, and the malleability of
that which appeared as necessary and natural (see Moir 2018, Levitas
1990).</p>

<p>
As with Adorno and Marcuse, Bloch apparently paradoxically combines a
keen attention to the formal constitution of the artwork and its
autonomy (Bloch 2000: 118) with a commitment to the claim that social
conditions enter into the artwork (Bloch 2000: 129&ndash;141).
Crucially, it is the combination of the autonomous processes of art
and the participation of the appreciator which yields up a disruptive
experience (Bloch 2000: 143). This disruption within the aesthetic
experience serves to point beyond the integration of the
artwork&rsquo;s form and its material; and via the relationship
between the artwork and the social content it integrates, it likewise
points beyond the established social order (Bloch 2000: 117, 149,
155&ndash;156). This is the utopian moment integral to great art, for
Bloch. In <em>Spirit of Utopia</em> Bloch largely develops this
thought through analysis of music, but in later works like
<em>Principle of Hope</em> (Bloch 1954&ndash;59), the same approach is
recapitulated and applied not only to the various artistic media, but
other cultural areas also (see Bloch 1989).</p>

<p>
This core vision &ndash; of the artwork as eliciting in aesthetic
experience a changed outlook on a reified society &ndash; is inherited
by both Adorno and Marcuse. But both revise Bloch&rsquo;s approach in
differing ways.</p>

<h3 id="Ado">4.2 Adorno</h3>

<p>
For Adorno art does not directly show the world as it really is, but
makes plain the contradictions and distortions internal to reified
consciousness itself. Rather than disclosing new potentials for action
and change, art instead discloses the full estrangement between
reified consciousness and the world. In other words genuine aesthetic
experience is a process of disillusionment. Our reified consciousness
perceives no obvious difference between the world as we take it to be,
and the world as it is. But art forcibly discloses this difference.
The art appreciator comes to learn the depth and extent of their
ignorance, and the urgency of breaking with the dominant form of
thought. The utopianism of Bloch reappears in a more muted form
&ndash; art gives us awareness that the demands and tendencies of
capitalist society are not absolute but could in principle change.
Adorno&rsquo;s caveat is that we do not know how or in what direction
this change should be effected. This is due to the broader ethical
dislocation produced by modern society. (For differing takes on
Adorno&rsquo;s negative ethics see Finlayson 2002, Freyenhagen 2011,
2013, Bernstein 2001; a transcribed discussion between Adorno and
Bloch on the nature of utopian thinking provides useful further
detail, in Bloch 1989: 1&ndash;18).</p>

<p>
The way in which art demonstrates the disconnection between reified
thought and the world is highly complex. We can say that for Adorno
art engages the conceptual structure of thought and experience, and
guides it such that this structure is lead to collapse in the course
of its being applied. This is a power it shares with philosophy, with
the key difference that philosophy achieves this explicitly &ndash;
through manipulation of and argument about concepts in the course of
their application in thought &ndash; and art accomplishes it through
the manipulation of aesthetic material. To answer how the
&lsquo;hermetically sealed&rsquo; artwork is able to do this, we would
need to spell out Adorno&rsquo;s claim that extra-aesthetic content is
sedimented into formal aesthetic problematics in individual artworks.
This is beyond the scope of the present entry (but see Hulatt 2016a,
Nicholsen 1997a, Paddison 2011, Sherratt 2009: 169&ndash;209).</p>

<h3 id="Mar">4.3 Marcuse</h3>

<p>
Marcuse sees artworks as having a liberating potential, and as
disclosing to us possibilities for change. Art discloses these
possibilities in both a destructive and creative way. It is
destructive in that it serves as an &lsquo;indictment&rsquo; of
certain governing forms of thought and experience. But it is also
creative; art serves to re-present the genuine state of things, and
thus uncovers the objective potentials for &lsquo;liberation&rsquo;
which are concealed there (Marcuse 1978: 6). Marcuse&rsquo;s work can
thus be understood as an amalgam of some of the formal sophistication
of Adorno&rsquo;s aesthetics with the utopian emphasis of
Bloch&rsquo;s account.</p>

<p>
For Bloch and Adorno, engagement with the artwork leads in radically
differing directions. For Adorno, aesthetic experience does not point
towards a better future, nor show any signs of such a future in the
present. It rather shows the inhumanity of the present. This is the
&lsquo;indictment&rsquo; Marcuse likewise finds in art. For Bloch, by
contrast, aesthetic experience presents an account of the genuine
state of things, which includes already existing anticipations of a
better form of life. These &lsquo;anticipations&rsquo; provide the
intelligible, if incomplete, link between the present and the utopia
that could emerge from it. These Marcuse often refers to as moments of
&lsquo;liberation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
It may seem that the two points from Bloch and Adorno are in tension,
and thus that Marcuse is ill-advised to try to combine them. However,
Marcuse introduces a third theoretic element which resolves the
apparent tension &ndash; the work of Sigmund Freud (1856&ndash;1939).
The rational, critical element of Marcuse&rsquo;s account conforms
significantly to Adorno&rsquo;s approach &ndash; but the utopianism of
Bloch is recast in a psychoanalytic register.</p>

<p>
Marcuse understands the utopian function of art to be discharged by
its ability to facilitate &lsquo;desublimation&rsquo; &ndash; the
expression of repressed urges. This should not be confused with
catharsis. Catharsis &ndash; in which emotions are activated and then
&lsquo;purged&rsquo; &ndash; leaves the subject pacified, free of the
troublesome energies that were activated. This pacifying effect of
catharsis in art is criticized by Marcuse, and desublimation is held
to avoid it.</p>

<p>
For Marcuse, desublimation is an expression of repressed emotions,
urges and potentialities of which the appreciator was unaware. On
learning of their existence, the appreciator is made aware of
&lsquo;repressed potentialities of man and nature&rsquo; and is
granted an &lsquo;emancipation of sensibility&rsquo; which points
towards the form of life, and of sensibility, which revolution would
bring about (Marcuse 1978: 8&ndash;9; see further 43&ndash;44). This
is continuous with Marcuse&rsquo;s broader political program, for
which a better world would not only entail re-organization of the
structure of society, but also of the psychological structure that
society imposes on individuals (see Kellner 1999, Marcuse 1955).</p>

<p>
For Marcuse, then, the aesthetic experience is both critical and
rationally ordered, and an arena for the liberation of drives,
emotions and potentials. These respectively articulate the
contradictions and intolerability of the present, and unharness the
libidinal resources which could realize the potential for a better
future.</p>

<h2 id="NatBea">5. Natural beauty</h2>

<p>
In the 20<sup>th</sup> century philosophers &ndash; anglophone and
non-anglophone &ndash; largely shifted away from discussing the
aesthetics of nature. The Frankfurt School were a marked exception to
this tendency. In their emphasis on the moral and aesthetic
significance of nature&rsquo;s beauty, critical theorists anticipate
many features of contemporary work in
 <a href="../environmental-aesthetics/">environmental aesthetics</a>.
 Like environmental aestheticians, critical theorists understand our
appreciation of nature&rsquo;s beauty to be morally significant. They
also likewise see aesthetic appreciation of nature to be bound up with
the recognition of and resistance to humanity&rsquo;s destruction and
exploitation of nature.</p>

<p>
Critical theorists differ sharply from contemporary environmental
aestheticians, however, in their account of what carries this moral
significance. It is not nature &lsquo;in itself&rsquo;, without human
interference, that is of prime importance. Any idea of nature being
ahistorically beautiful &lsquo;in itself&rsquo; is rejected. It is
nature in relation to our current human capacities, needs, and
projects which carries both beauty and a moral impetus to relate to
nature in a less damaging fashion.</p>

<p>
This section will touch briefly on some of the distinctive features of
their work on this theme.</p>

<h3 id="NatHis">5.1 Nature and History</h3>

<p>
Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse consistently problematized the
distinction between nature and history. They did not claim that nature
&ndash; as picked out by the physical sciences &ndash; was
historically relative. They rather claimed that the concept (and
experience) of nature &ndash; as a realm of facts and values outside
of human control &ndash; was historically determined in its content
and means of application.</p>

<p>
When Adorno and Horkheimer claim that what is natural is historical
they are interested in normative conceptions of nature which are used
either to make the contingent appear necessary (&lsquo;capitalism
simply follows human nature&rsquo;) or to advocate for inhumane
treatment of persons. Likewise, they propose that nature as
experienced is influenced by these historical factors. (Adorno&rsquo;s
complex account of nature is developed in its various strands in Cook
2011, Vogel 1996: 51&ndash;101, Flodin 2018, 2022.)</p>

<p>
Natural beauty in both its scope (what counts as natural) and quality
(those aesthetic properties which can attach in virtue of an
object&rsquo;s being natural) is seen as a historical phenomenon
(Hammer 2015: 45&ndash;72). This further means that natural beauty
stands under the threat of clich&eacute;, ideological misuse, and
co-optation, just as artworks do. Simply, the aesthetic properties of
nature shift across time &ndash; and what is thus appropriate in
judging natural beauty likewise develops over time (Daniels 2020).</p>

<p>
Any well-developed aesthetics of nature includes not only a criterion
of appropriate judgement, but also a criterion of the appropriate
objects of judgement. Trivially, aesthetic judgements of nature cannot
be well-formed when aimed at an object which is the product of, and
perceived under the description of, complete artificiality.
Conventionally, the meaningful debate to be had is over what degree,
if any, objects produced by artifice are appropriate objects of the
appreciation of natural beauty.</p>

<p>
Critical theory adds a unique complication to this debate. It denies
that the merely natural is an appropriate object for aesthetic
experience (Johnson 2011). We will explore this in the next
section.</p>

<h3 id="MerNat">5.2 Mere Nature</h3>

<p>
Critical theory sets a high store on the aesthetic experience of
nature, but not on the experience of mere nature. This is made
particularly stark in <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, where Adorno compares
raw nature with industrial materials:</p>

<blockquote>
[N]ature that has not been pacified by human cultivation, nature over
which no human hand has passed &ndash; alpine moraines and taluses
&ndash; resembles &hellip; industrial mountains of debris. &hellip;
[Human artifice] is said to have ravished nature, yet under
transformed relations of production it would just as easily be able to
assist nature and on this sad earth help it to attain what perhaps it
wants. &hellip; [I]n every particular aesthetic experience of nature
the social whole is lodged. Society &hellip; determines what nature
means[.] (Adorno 1970 [2004: 89])
</blockquote>

<p>
This rejection of an aesthetics of nature in the raw is combined with
a keen interest in natural beauty. This appears paradoxical, but can
be elucidated through comparison with contemporary environmental
aesthetics.</p>

<p>
For environmental aesthetics, mere nature is indeed an appropriate
object of aesthetic attention (see, e.g., Budd 1996: 211&ndash;213,
Saito 1998). The properties of mere nature, as opposed to artworks,
are held to undermine some traditional dichotomies. For example,
Ronald Hepburn (1966) influentially observed that nature needs to be
&lsquo;framelessly&rsquo; appreciated as an enclosing space. The usual
strict separation between an art-object and its environs is not
present, as nature is both the immediate object of interest (a copse
of trees, for example) and the enclosure continuous with the object
(the vista in which the copse is situated). Separately, it has been
claimed that appropriate aesthetic appreciation of nature benefits
from, or requires, theoretical understanding of nature itself and its
structure (for examples of such scientific cognitivism, see Carlson
1979, Eaton 1998, Parsons 2006). Such scientifically grounded
appreciation of nature is held to be objective appreciation of nature
as what it is.</p>

<p>
Critical theory&rsquo;s rejection of mere nature can be seen as
stemming from a similar desire to appreciate nature &lsquo;as what it
is&rsquo;, and a similar conviction that doing so will dissolve the
oppositions and dichotomies familiar from art. But critical theory
urges us to further dissolve the dichotomy between nature and human
artifice itself.</p>

<p>
Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse see nature and humanity as not
separate but continuous (for an overview of this, and its relation to
Luk&aacute;cs and Marx, see Feenberg 1981: 240&ndash;255). And so
proper contemplation of nature &lsquo;as-it-is&rsquo; is of
nature-for-us, as parts of that nature. Mere nature is nature which
stands opposed to us, and which we are approaching as if it were
radically different to us, rather than a fellow piece of nature. This
is why Adorno sees untamed nature as resembling unrefined industrial
material &ndash; in both cases (the merely natural; the industrial
byproduct) we have objects which appear to stand opposed to human
need, and present as hostile to us.</p>

<p>
This is what stands behind remarks by both Adorno and Marcuse to the
effect that both humanity and nature are not fully realized. Nature by
itself, for Adorno and Marcuse, is unreconciled and hostile towards
humans, who are themselves part of nature. For nature&rsquo;s own
benefit, a different kind of relationship between humans and nature is
required. And natural beauty is held to point towards it (Krebber
2020: 184&ndash;186).</p>

<p>
It is common to find in environmental aesthetics an admission that the
area of enquiry is bound up either with moral intuitions about
nature&rsquo;s value, or in some way importantly tied to a broader
moral project of environmental conservation and transformation (e.g.
Saito 1984, Saito 2018, Carlson 2018, Alcaraz Le&oacute;n 2022,
Carlson &amp; Lintott 2008). Here again, Adorno and Marcuse can be
understood as sharing this feature and transforming it. Their
environmental aesthetics is not embedded in care for
nature-without-humans, but for nature-for-humans, and correlatively,
humans-for-nature.</p>

<h3 id="RecRuiLan">5.3 Reconciliation, Ruins and Landscapes</h3>

<p>
Adorno and Marcuse embed aesthetic response to nature into a broader
project of reconceiving and reorienting the relationship between
humanity and nature. Following on from a myriad of influences (some
anthropological &ndash; chiefly Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss
(1902&ndash;1903), James George Frazer (1890), and Roger Caillois
(e.g., 1937) &ndash; and some philosophical) critical theory
understands the relationship between humanity and nature to have been
predominantly &lsquo;dominating&rsquo;, just as humanity&rsquo;s
relationship to itself has been dominating and oppressive. Similarly,
just as aesthetic experience offers a vision of a different order of
social being, so too does aesthetic experience of nature offer a
vision of a reconciled relationship between human agency and
nature.</p>

<p>
Mere nature, then, is ineligible to produce such an insight, as mere
nature is outside of and opposed to a relationship with humanity. This
leads Adorno to find images of reconciliation in, paradoxically,
images of bygone eras of the exploitation of nature. Here Adorno
intersects with the rich aesthetic traditions of both the picturesque
and the ruin, but brings a very different sensibility to these
phenomena. In <em>Aesthetic Theory</em> he writes,</p>

<blockquote>
Historical works are often considered beautiful that have some
relation to their geographical setting, as for instance hillside towns
that are related to their setting by the use of its stone &hellip;. So
long as progress &hellip; does violence to the surface of the earth, it
will be impossible &ndash; in spite of all proof to the contrary
&ndash; completely to counter the perception that what antedates the
trend is in its backwardness better and more humane. (Adorno 1970
[2004: 84])
</blockquote>

<p>
What grounds Adorno&rsquo;s positive aesthetic evaluation here is the
image of a relationship between nature and humanity which, from our
timeframe, appears more pacified. Given the environmentally disastrous
logic of modern society, the images of a reconciled, utopian
relationship to nature can be found only retrospectively, in the image
of the less-bad relationships to nature which have now passed
away.</p>

<h2 id="ConCriTheAes">6. Conclusion &ndash; Critical Theory and Aesthetics</h2>

<p>
We can pick out four features of critical theory&rsquo;s distinctive
treatment of aesthetics. The first of these is a product of critical
theory&rsquo;s general methodology at that time. First generation
critical theory largely holds that any object of experience or theory
is a part in and reflective of a social totality of facts and
processes (see further Jay 1992). The form and depth of this
&lsquo;reflection&rsquo; varies; but the general view is that any
element of this totality could be determined by, and inform us about,
any other. This warrants speculative kinds of philosophical
interpretation, in which facts apparently limited to one sphere (of
logic, or psychology, say) are in fact determined by and reflective of
apparently disconnected spheres (of economic exchange, or social
institutions, say). Art is no exception to this approach. Both works
of high art and ephemeral pieces of pop culture can have
philosophical, social, and political content as parts of their
objective constitution.</p>

<p>
Secondly, this emphasis on the philosophical richness of art is
combined with a primary interest in aesthetic form. In turn, this
amalgam is wedded to a conviction that aesthetic experience &ndash;
despite being formally rigorous and content-laden &ndash; can offer a
form of insight unavailable through conventional conceptual reasoning.
This insight &ndash; precisely by being a break with the kind of
experience moulded to the &lsquo;wrong state of things&rsquo; &ndash;
is held to have emancipatory promise.</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the tensions and instabilities between these jointly held
aesthetic methodologies are not accidental, but intentional. Critical
theory refuses to attempt to deliver static definitions, but also
refuses to do without such definitions. (It is neither
&lsquo;rationalized&rsquo;, nor irrational.) Art really does have
general features; but successful artworks always both engage and
destabilize general concepts. There is an emphasis on the necessity of
using concepts to understand art, and on the ability of artworks to
ultimately elude conceptual capture. This complex approach &ndash;
which is incapable of delivering a closed definition of art or
aesthetic value &ndash; is intended to prioritize fidelity to
aesthetic experience over dogmatic conceptual structures.</p>

<p>
Fourthly, and following from the preceding three features, there is
the seemingly paradoxical conviction that artworks are political and
practical via their very refusal of explicit politics and
practicality. It is artworks of surpassing quality, attended to for
their own sake, that have a liberating potential. Critical theory
tends to assume (and sometimes explicitly argue) that artists who
primarily pursue a non-artistic goal in their art (political or
otherwise) cannot realize this level of quality, and art-appreciators
who seek a pay-off in art (political or otherwise) cannot properly
attend to the value of artworks.</p>

<p>
These four features all reach their most extreme expression in the
work of Theodor Adorno. But they are also pursued at differing levels
of extremity and emphasis in other critical theorists and thinkers
associated with them, most obviously Marcuse, Benjamin and Bloch.</p>

<p>
For critical theorists, there is a balance to be struck between
analysing art &ndash; and hence articulating it in conceptual terms
&ndash; and making clear the importance of the artwork&rsquo;s ability
to outstrip concepts altogether. The preceding has been an account of
the ways in which critical theory has explored and handled this
demanding balancing act, and the broader theoretic considerations
which, together with the artworks investigated, entered into that
balance.</p>
