<h1>Paul Feyerabend</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Aug 26, 1997; substantive revision Sun Feb 23, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Paul Feyerabend (1924&ndash;1994) initially made a name for himself in
the foundations of quantum theory and as an ardent supporter of Karl
Popper&rsquo;s critical rationalism. He argued that good science
should be an attempt to re-interpret experience according to our best
scientific theories, which should be used to correct common knowledge
and everyday language to promote progress. His early work resulted
from a critical synthesis of Popper&rsquo;s views on empiricism with
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s insights on meaning. Specifically, Feyerabend
combined Popper&rsquo;s views on testability with Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
insight that theories determine the meanings of observation sentences
so that the same observation sentences make incompatible observation
statements, depending on which theory is used to interpret them.
Feyerabend used these peculiar views to criticize his interpretation
of Popper&rsquo;s empiricism (&lsquo;falsificationism&rsquo;) from
within Popper&rsquo;s broader philosophical framework (&lsquo;critical
rationalism&rsquo;). According to Feyerabend, Popper&rsquo;s
empiricism has a limited validity. It is limited to testing
commensurable theories because it relies on formal relations between
corresponding predictions deduced from incompatible rivals. By
contrast, meaning change through scientific revolution renders rival
worldviews, as realistic interpretations of experience, logically
disjoint (or &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo;). Feyerabend proposed a
general model for testing incommensurable rivals based on conjectures
and novel, theory-laden corroborations as exemplified by the Brownian
motion example. Feyerabend was arguing for theoretical pluralism, and
more tolerance toward new proposals, especially toward new approaches
in the foundations of quantum theory, such as David Bohm&rsquo;s
&lsquo;hidden variables&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend developed the consequences of his&nbsp;views on meaning and
method, arguing that scientific progress should be understood to be an
&lsquo;ever-expanding ocean of alternatives&rsquo; while continuing to
criticize falsificationism from within Popper&rsquo;s critical
rationalist camp &ndash; until mid-December of 1967 when Feyerabend
had an epiphany and &lsquo;awoke from his dogmatic slumber&rsquo;. In
personal letters, he dramatically announced he was breaking with the
Popperian school. He explained his reasons by generalizing from the
limited validity of falsificationism to the limited validity of all
methodological rules. He also outlined his new
&ldquo;&lsquo;position&rsquo;&rdquo; to be entitled &ldquo;Against
Method&rdquo;, according to which &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo;. In this
way, Feyerabend reversed himself on realism, from recommending
correcting common knowledge and everyday language with science in his
early work to recommending protecting common knowledge and everyday
language from the tyranny of scientism in his later work. He became
one of Popper&rsquo;s most raucous critics both in methodology and in
the foundations of quantum mechanics. His most famous work,
<em>Against Method: Outline of an Anarchist Theory of Knowledge</em>
(1975, 1988, 1993), redeploys his early ideas and arguments from his
new perspective. As he made his &lsquo;historical turn&rsquo;, he
increasingly focused on transitions in worldviews, such as
Galileo&rsquo;s role in the scientific revolution and the rise of
Western rationalism. He was seen as a leading cultural relativist who
became a post-modernist and is celebrated as one of the most
influential philosophers of the twentieth century. His denunciations
of Western imperialism, his critique of scientism, his defense of the
pursuit of alternative medicine and astrology, and his emphasis on
environmental issues made him a hero of anti-technological
countercultures.</p>

<h2 id="BrieChroFeyeLifeWork">1. A Brief Chronology of Feyerabend&rsquo;s Life and Work</h2>

<p>
Feyerabend led an extraordinarily eventful life, interacting directly
with several prominent philosophers and scientists, most notably Karl
Popper, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Niels Bohr, and David Bohm, who became
significant influences on the development of his views.
Feyerabend&rsquo;s formative development is best seen against the
backdrop of his tumultuous relationship with his mentor Karl Popper,
Initially, Feyerabend was an ardent supporter of Popper&rsquo;s
philosophy of science (&lsquo;falsificationism&rsquo;) and his broader
philosophy (&lsquo;critical rationalism&rsquo;). In 1962, Feyerabend
began to criticize falsificationism while continuing to support
critical rationalism. After an epiphany, in private letters sent on
the 17th of December 1967, Feyerabend broke with Popper&rsquo;s
school, generalizing from the limited validity of falsificationism to
&ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; (the limited validity of all
methodological rules). He reversed himself on realism from
recommending correcting common knowledge and everyday language with
science to protecting common knowledge and everyday language from
scientism, abandoning his earlier project, and beginning his later
work. He repeatedly redeveloped his views on meaning and method,
making them relevant to a broad range of controversial issues, from
his relativism in political philosophy in the late 1970s and 1980s, to
his post-modernism in the 1990s.</p>

<h2 id="FeyeEarlLife">2. Feyerabend&rsquo;s Early Life</h2>

<p>
(Unless otherwise stated, page references are to <em>Killing Time: The
Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend</em> (1995), henceforth referred to
as <em>&ldquo;KT&rdquo;</em>).</p>

<h3 id="Yout19241938">2.1 Youth (1924 &ndash;1938)</h3>

<p>
Paul Karl Feyerabend was born into a middle-class Viennese family in
1924. Times were hard in Vienna in the nineteen-twenties: in the
aftermath of the First World War there were famines, hunger riots, and
runaway inflation. Feyerabend&rsquo;s family had a three-room
apartment on the <em>Wolfganggasse</em>, &ldquo;a quiet street lined
with oak trees&rdquo; (p. 11). The first chapters of his autobiography
give the impression of his being a strange child, whose activities
were entirely centered around his own family, and who was cut off from
neighbors, other children, and the outside world because &ldquo;[t]he
world is a dangerous place&rdquo; (p. 15). Between the ages of three
and six, Feyerabend recalls, he spent most of his time in the
apartment&rsquo;s kitchen and bedroom. Occasional visits to the cinema
and numerous stories, especially stories with a magical aura, seem to
have taken the place usually filled by childhood friends. He was a
sickly child, who ran away from home once when he was five years old
(p. 7). When he started school at the age of six, he &ldquo;had no
idea how other people lived or what to do with them&rdquo; (p. 16).
The world seemed to be filled with strange and inexplicable
happenings. It took him some while to get used to school, which
initially made him sick. But when he did so, his health problems had
disappeared. When he learned to read, he found the new and magical
world of books waiting for him and indulged himself to the full (p.
25). But his sense of the world&rsquo;s inexplicability took some time
to dissipate&mdash;he recalls feeling that way about events during the
nineteen-thirties and throughout the Second World War.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend attended a <em>Realgymnasium</em> (High School), where he
was taught Latin, English, and science. He was a
<em>Vorzugssch&uuml;ler</em>, that is, &ldquo;a student whose grades
exceeded a certain average&rdquo; (p. 22), and by the time he was
sixteen, he had the reputation of knowing more about physics and math
than his teachers. He was also thrown out of school once.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend &ldquo;stumbled into drama and philosophy&rdquo; (p. 26) by
accident, becoming something of a ham actor in the process. This
accident then led to another, when he found himself forced to accept
philosophy texts among the bundles of books he had bought for the
plays and novels they contained. It was, he later claimed, &ldquo;the
dramatic possibilities of reasoning and&hellip; the power that
arguments seem to exert over people&rdquo; (p. 27) with which
philosophy had fascinated him. Although he was a philosopher by
profession, he preferred to be thought of as an entertainer. His
interests, he said, were always somewhat unfocussed (p. 27).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend&rsquo;s school physics teacher, Oswald Thomas, inspired his
interest in physics and astronomy. The first presentation Feyerabend
gave (at school) seems to have been on those subjects (p. 28).
Together with his father, he built a telescope and &ldquo;became a
regular observer for the Swiss Institute of Solar Research&rdquo; (p.
29). He describes his scientific interests as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
I was interested in both the technical and the more general aspects of
physics and astronomy, but I drew no distinction between them. For me,
Eddington, Mach (his <em>Mechanics</em> and <em>Theory of Heat</em>),
and Hugo Dingler (<em>Foundations of Geometry</em>) were scientists
who moved freely from one end of their subject to the other. I read
Mach very carefully and made many notes (p. 30).
</blockquote>

<p>
Feyerabend does not tell us how he became acquainted with another one
of his main preoccupations&mdash;singing. He was proud of his voice,
became a member of a choir, and took singing lessons for years, later
claiming to have remained in California in order not to have to give
up his singing teacher. In his autobiography he talks of the pleasure,
greater than any intellectual pleasure, derived from having and using
a well-trained singing voice (p. 83). During the Second World War, his
interest in singing led him to attend the opera together with his
mother in Vienna (first the <em>Volksoper</em>, and then the
<em>Staatsoper</em>). A former opera singer, Johann Langer, gave him
singing lessons and encouraged him to go to an academy. After passing
the entrance examination, Feyerabend did so, becoming a pupil of Adolf
Vogel. At this point in his life, he later recalled:</p>

<blockquote>
The course of my life was [&hellip;] clear: theoretical astronomy
during the day, preferably in the domain of perturbation theory; then
rehearsals, coaching, vocal exercises, opera in the evening
[&hellip;]; and astronomical observation at night [&hellip;] The only
remaining obstacle was the war (p. 35).
</blockquote>

<h3 id="Ansc1938">2.2 The <em>Anschluss</em> (1938)</h3>

<p>
Feyerabend tells how, without falling for Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s
charisma, he appreciated Hitler&rsquo;s oratorial style. Austria was
reunified with Germany in 1938. Jewish schoolmates were treated
differently, and Jewish neighbors and acquaintances started
disappearing. He actively participated in the Hitler Youth program (p.
38), and yet, Feyerabend maintained that he had no clear view of the
situation:</p>

<blockquote>
Much of what happened I learned only after the war, from articles,
books, and television, and the events I did notice either made no
impression at all or affected me in a random way. I remember them and
I can describe them, but there was no context to give them meaning and
no aim to judge them by (pp. 37&ndash;8).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
For me the German occupation and the war that followed were an
inconvenience, not a moral problem, and my reactions came from
accidental moods and circumstances, not from a well-defined outlook
(p. 38).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The general impression given by his autobiography is of an imaginative
but fairly solitary person with no stable or well-defined personality,
with a tendency to adopt strange views and push them to the extreme
&ndash; a tendency that stayed with him throughout his life (p. 39).
Given his lack of definite principles, his decisions seem to have been
the result of a struggle between his tendency to conform and his
contrariness (p. 40). He was easily persuaded by views before becoming
critical of them in defense of alternatives. Just as when he was a
child, events happening around him continued to seem strange, distant,
and somehow out of context without a definite framework with which to
make sense of them.</p>

<h3 id="War1939">2.3 The War (1939&ndash;1945)</h3>

<p>
As far as his army record goes, Feyerabend claims in his autobiography
that his mind is a blank. And yet, motivated in part by the Waldheim
affair, this is one of the periods he tells us most about. It had deep
and long-lasting consequences for his views, his body, and his psyche.
Having passed his final high school exams in March 1942, he was
drafted into the <em>Arbeitsdienst</em> (the work service introduced
by the Nazis), and sent for basic training in Pirmasens, Germany.
Feyerabend opted to stay in Germany to keep out of the way of the
fighting, but subsequently asked to be sent to where the fighting was,
having become bored with cleaning the barracks! He even considered
joining the SS, for aesthetic reasons. His unit was then posted at
Quelerne en Bas, near Brest, in Brittany. Still, the events of the war
did not register. In November 1942, he returned home to Vienna but
left before Christmas to join the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s Pioneer Corps.</p>

<p>
Their training took place in Krems, near Vienna. Feyerabend soon
volunteered for officers&rsquo; school, not because of an urge for
leadership, but out of a wish to survive, using officers&rsquo; school
as a way to avoid front-line fighting. The trainees were sent to
Yugoslavia. In Vukovar, in July 1943, he learned of his mother&rsquo;s
suicide, but was completely unmoved, and noticeably shocked his fellow
officers by displaying no feeling. In October he was promoted to lance
corporal. In December, his unit was sent into battle on the northern
part of the Russian front. Although they blew up every house in their
path, they never encountered any Russian soldiers, nor any civilians
&ndash; with two exceptions. On one occasion, men and women were
herded into a cellar before a grenade was tossed in after them. On
another, a civilian was shot right in the head. Although his memory
was admittedly strangely selective, these disturbing memories stayed
with him (p. 46).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend reports that he was foolhardy during battle, treating it as
a theatrical event. He received the Iron Cross (second class) early in
March 1944, for leading his men into a village under enemy fire and
then occupying it. He was promoted to sergeant in April, and then to
lieutenant toward the end of that year (taking command of a company of
seasoned soldiers). At the end of November, having completed his
assignment, he gave a series of lectures at the officers&rsquo; school
in Dessau-Rosslau, near Leipzig. Their theme was the
(&ldquo;historicist&rdquo;) one that &ldquo;historical periods such as
the Baroque, the Rococo, the Gothic Age are unified by a concealed
essence that only a lonely outsider can understand&rdquo; (p. 49). His
description of these lectures, and his notebook entries at the time,
reveal the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche in their fascination with
this &ldquo;lonely outsider&rdquo;, &ldquo;the solitary thinker&rdquo;
(p. 48).</p>

<p>
Having returned home for Christmas 1944, Feyerabend again boarded the
train for the front, this time for Poland, in January 1945. There,
during the retreat, he was put in charge of a bicycle company, only to
lose all of their bicycles to the advancing Russians the next day.
Although he claims to have relished the role of army officer no more
than he later did that of a university professor, he must have been
quite competent, as in the field he came to take the place of a
sequence of injured officers: first a lieutenant, then a captain, and
then a major. Eventually, he,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
was in command of three tanks; an infantry battalion; auxiliary troops
from Finland, Poland, the Ukraine; and masses of German refugees (p.
51).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In 1945, he was shot during a heroic act of carelessness (trying to
direct traffic, while taking fire from all sides). The surgery
removing the bullet lodged in his spine left him paralyzed from the
waist down. He spent time in a wheelchair, and then on crutches,
before learning to walk with the aid of a cane. The war ended as he
was recovering from his injury, in a hospital in Apolda, a little town
near Weimar, while fervently hoping not to recover before the war was
over. Germany&rsquo;s surrender came as a relief, but also as a
disappointment relative to past hopes and aspirations. He later said
of his stint in the army that it was &ldquo;an interruption, a
nuisance; I forgot about it the moment it was over&rdquo; (p. 111),
but he also said that he had to learn to live with awakening in the
middle of the night from reoccurring nightmares in which he had either
to commit treason or murder (pp. 52&ndash;53).</p>

<h3 id="PostWarActi1945">2.4 Post-War Activities (1945&ndash;1947)</h3>

<p>
The war took its toll on Feyerabend. The bullet that was removed from
his spine left him impotent for the rest of his life (his
autobiography contains amusing descriptions of many subsequent sexual
encounters). Although he started off completely ignorant of women, he
married four times, and had, by his own account, plenty of affairs.
But he seems to have been distant not just in his relationship with
his parents, but in some of his marriages too. He hated the slavery
love seemed to imply, but hated equally the freedom achieved by taking
evasive action. He got bogged down in cycles of dependence, isolation,
and renewed dependence, which only dissolved into a more balanced
pattern after many years.</p>

<p>
At the end of the war, Feyerabend went to the mayor of Apolda and
asked for a job. He was assigned to the education section, given an
office and a secretary and, fittingly, put in charge of entertainment.
In 1946, having recovered from paralysis, he received a state
fellowship to return to study singing and stage management for a year
at the <em>Musikhochschule</em> in Weimar. He moved from Apolda to
Weimar after about three months. At the Weimar <em>Institut zur
Methodologischen Erneuerung des Deutschen Theaters,</em> he studied
theatre, and at the Weimar Academy, he took classes in Italian,
harmony, piano, singing, and enunciation. Singing remained one of his
life&rsquo;s major interests. He attended performances (drama, opera,
ballet, concerts) at Weimar&rsquo;s <em>Nationaltheater</em>, and
later reminisced about opera stars of the time, recalling debates and
arguments about theatre (e.g. the stereotyping of roles and plays)
with Maxim Vallentin, Hans Eisler, etc. He also played a small part in
the film <em>Der Proze&szlig;</em>&nbsp;(1948) directed by the
renowned G.W. Pabst. Although, by his own account, he led a full life,
he became restless and decided to move.</p>

<h2 id="FeyeTurnPhilKrafCircPoppWitt">3. Feyerabend&rsquo;s Turn to Philosophy: The Kraft Circle, Popper and Wittgenstein</h2>

<p>
The details of Feyerabend&rsquo;s developing relationships with Popper
and Wittgenstein (and their ideas) frame Feyerabend&rsquo;s
philosophical development. Feyerabend took Popper and Wittgenstein to
be two of his philosophical father figures (Felix Ehrenhaft was
another, on Feyerabend and Ehrenhaft, see Collodel 2022 and Shaw
2017b). The centerpiece of his early philosophy of science,
&ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a), is a
critical synthesis of Popper&rsquo;s empiricism with
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s insights on meaning, which eventually led to his
break with Popper&rsquo;s school in December 1967.</p>

<h3 id="RetuVienUnivAlpbPopp1947">3.1 Return to Vienna: University, Alpbach and Popper (1947&ndash;1948)</h3>

<p>
Feyerabend returned to his parents&rsquo; apartment house in
Vienna&rsquo;s 15th district on crutches. Although he planned to study
physics, math, and astronomy, he initially chose instead to read
history and sociology at the University of Vienna&rsquo;s <em>Institut
f&uuml;r Osterreichische Geschichtsforschung</em>, thinking that
history, unlike physics, is concerned with real life. However, he
quickly became dissatisfied with history and returned to theoretical
physics. Although he later denied having studied philosophy, his
college transcript indicates that he also took classes in philosophy
of science in all eight semesters (he also took four consecutive
classes and completed a practicum in psychology). Together with a
group of science students, who all regarded themselves as far superior
to students of other subjects, Feyerabend invaded philosophy lectures
and seminars. Although this was not his first contact with philosophy,
it seems to have been the period that cemented his interest.</p>

<p>
At the time, he took the positivist line that science is the basis of
knowledge; that it is empirical; and that nonempirical enterprises are
either logic or nonsense (p. 68). These views would have been familiar
from the climate of Logical Positivism which found its main root in
the Vienna Circle, a group of scientifically-minded philosophers who,
in the nineteen-twenties and thirties sought to deploy the newly
revitalized formal logic of Gottlob Frege and Russell and
Whitehead&rsquo;s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> to represent the
structure of human knowledge. Feyerabend&rsquo;s youthful scientism
makes quite a contrast with his later criticisms of it.</p>

<p>
In August 1948, at the first meeting of the international summer
seminar of the Austrian College Society in Alpbach which he attended,
Feyerabend met the philosopher of science Karl Popper, who had already
made a name for himself as the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s &lsquo;official
opposition&rsquo;. (The Austrian College Society had been founded in
1945 by Austrian resistance fighters, &ldquo;to provide a forum for
the exchange of scholars and ideas and so to prepare the political
unification of Europe&rdquo; (1978, p. 109). In contrast to the
inductivism of positivism, Popper defended deductivism as the logic of
justification. In his 1934 book <em>Logik der Forschung,</em> Popper
elaborated the straightforward and appealing falsificationist view
that science is a process of conjecture and refutation. Good science
should be characterized as a process of bold conjectures and our best
attempts to refute them. In the 1950s, Feyerabend was an ardent
supporter of Popper&rsquo;s normative approach and Feyerabend&rsquo;s
philosophical development was affected tremendously by his tumultuous
relationship with Popper and his views both in general methodology and
the foundations of quantum theory (Collodel 2016; Collodel and
Oberheim 2020; Kuby 2021; van Strien 2020).</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Popper&rsquo;s autobiography tells us nothing about
their relationship, although he was to be the largest single influence
(first positive, then negative) on Feyerabend&rsquo;s development. For
those hoping that Feyerabend would have used the occasion of his
autobiography to clarify his turbulent relationship with Popper, it is
disappointing that the book tells us so little about it. Elsewhere
Feyerabend tells us that initially when they met in Alpbach in 1948,
where Popper presented his &ldquo;The Aim of Science&rdquo; (Kuby
2021), he</p>

<blockquote>
admired [Popper&rsquo;s] freedom of manners, his cheek, his
disrespectful attitude towards the German philosophers who gave the
proceedings weight in more senses than one, his sense of humor [
&hellip; and] his ability to restate ponderous problems in simple and
journalistic language. Here was a free mind, joyfully putting forth
his ideas, unconcerned about the reaction of the
&lsquo;professionals&rsquo; (1978, p. 115).
</blockquote>

<p>
But Popper&rsquo;s ideas themselves were not especially new to
Feyerabend. Viktor Kraft, who taught Feyerabend and supervised his
Ph.D. thesis, had been defending deductivism since 1925, and according
to Feyerabend, falsificationism was something &ldquo;taken for
granted&rdquo; at Alpbach. Popper&rsquo;s ideas, he remarked, were
also similar to those of another Viennese philosopher, Ludwig
Wittgenstein, although &ldquo;more abstract and anaemic&rdquo; (1978,
p. 116). As early as his 1955 review of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
<em>Investigations</em> (his first English publication), Feyerabend
suggested that Wittgenstein&rsquo;s nominalist and constructivist
views on meaning were less clear renditions of Popper&rsquo;s views.
Popper notoriously took Wittgenstein to be his arch-nemesis in
philosophy (see Edmonds and Eidinow, 2001), who was detracting from
the credit and attention he should be receiving.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend attended the Alpbach symposium another fifteen times, first
as a student, then as a lecturer and seminar chair. He also accepted
the post of &ldquo;scientific secretary&rdquo;, and this he called
&ldquo;the most decisive step of my life&rdquo; (p. 70). This fateful
decision answers his self-addressed questions about the origin of his
career, his reputation, and his situation at the time of writing his
autobiography since he traced his situation back to it. These annual
visits brought Feyerabend into contact with distinguished
scientists-philosophers such as Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger (1949, 1953,
1955), L&eacute;on Rosenfeld (1949), Maurice Pryce (1949), and Philipp
Frank (1950, 1955), which allowed him to make a name for himself on
both sides of the Atlantic in the second half of the 1950s as a
philosopher engaged with the foundations of quantum theory and
scientific method.</p>

<p>
At Alpbach, he was also approached by communists, including the
Marxist intellectual Walter Hollitscher, who became his teacher and
friend. Feyerabend resisted Hollitscher&rsquo;s political arguments
based on his own &ldquo;youthful elitism&rdquo; and &ldquo;an almost
instinctive aversion to group thinking&rdquo; (p. 73). But although
Feyerabend later described himself as having been &ldquo;a raving
positivist&rdquo; at the time, it was Hollitscher, he says, who
persuaded him of the cogency of realism about the &ldquo;external
world&rdquo;. Defending realism became a fundamental concern for
Feyerabend, who repeatedly argued that scientific research is and
should be conducted on the assumption of realism, which promotes
scientific progress in contrast to positivism and instrumentalism.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend developed his early ideas in a fascinating series of papers
on problems of empiricism, beginning in 1958 (itself based on his 1951
thesis), that argue that realism and pluralism promote scientific
progress and prevent it from stagnating into dangerous ideology. He
characterized what good science should be as &ldquo;An Attempt at a
Realistic [Re-] Interpretation of Experience&rdquo; (1958). Throughout
his early philosophy, he recommended correcting common knowledge
according to realistic interpretation of our best scientific theories,
until his December 1967 epiphany, when he broke from Popper&rsquo;s
school and reversed himself on realism, concluding that common
knowledge needs to be protected from scientism (Oberheim
forthcoming).</p>

<h3 id="PhysPhilKrafCircEhreEffeWitt1948">3.2 From Physics to Philosophy: The Kraft Circle, Ehrenhaft&rsquo;s Effects and Wittgenstein (1948&ndash;1952)</h3>

<p>
At The University of Vienna, Feyerabend was an aspiring physicist. He
studied physics under Hans Thirring, Karl Przibram, and Felix
Ehrenhaft, for whom he worked as an assistant. Ehrenhaft was an
experimental physicist known as a fierce and independent critic of all
kinds of orthodoxy in physics, who was often dismissed as a charlatan
after his infamous controversy with Millikan on the oil-drop
experiment (Holton 1978, Niaz 2005). Initially, Feyerabend and his
fellow science students looked forward to exposing Ehrenhaft as a
fraud. By 1949, Feyerabend was working as his assistant in Alpbach,
when he witnessed a dispute between Ehrenhaft and the orthodoxy in
which the former presented his experiments (which Feyerabend had
helped to set up), while the latter defended their position by using
strategies that Galileo&rsquo;s opponents would have been proud of,
ridiculing Ehrenhaft&rsquo;s phenomena as mere
<em>Dreckeffect</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Only much later did Ehrenhaft&rsquo;s lesson sink in and our attitude
at the time as well as the attitude of the entire profession provided
me then with an excellent illustration of the nature of scientific
rationality (1978, p. 111).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ehrenhaft did not convince the theoreticians, who protected themselves
with an iron curtain of dogmatic belief of exactly the same kind as
that deployed by Galileo&rsquo;s opponents. All the while, they
remained staunch empiricists, never doubting that science had to be
adapted to facts. Feyerabend later commented that the day-to-day
business of science, what Thomas Kuhn called &ldquo;normal
science&rdquo;, cannot exist without this kind of &ldquo;split
consciousness&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend&rsquo;s experience with Ehrenhaft deeply influenced him in
at least two significant respects. First, the impotence of
Ehrenhaft&rsquo;s experimental effects (which Feyerabend had helped
set up) motivated his interest in problems of empiricism, which became
the main theme in his early philosophy. Why were Ehrenhaft&rsquo;s
experimental effects impotent? Should they have been? More generally,
how should experimental effects be used to test theories and justify
theory choice? These were exactly the kinds of questions to which
Popper&rsquo;s empiricism provided answers, and which eventually led
Feyerabend to conclude that established theories only <em>seem</em>
empirically secure when there is a lack of alternative theories that
could show how they are wrong (Feyerabend 1962a). A second lasting
influence is demonstrated by Feyerabend&rsquo;s emphasis on the fact
that it is impossible to tell the difference between a charlatan and a
revolutionary except in hindsight, which began to play out in
Feyerabend&rsquo;s published papers in the mid-to late-1960s (see
Feyerabend 1964, Collodel 2022, Shaw 2017b), but only fully came to
fruition in conjunction with his new &lsquo;position&rsquo; in
&ldquo;Against Method&rdquo; (Feyerabend 1970), according to
which&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything goes!&rdquo; (Oberheim forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Following Popper, Feyerabend began to develop a keen interest in the
foundations of quantum theory in this period. To this end, from 1949
to 1952, he made annual trips to either Sweden or Denmark. As with
Wittgenstein, in August 1951, Feyerabend went to straight to the
source of the issues that interested him. He attended Bohr&rsquo;s
summer seminar in Askov, on &lsquo;the causality problem&rsquo;
(Collodel and Oberheim 2024, p. 14), where he witnessed an event that
significantly shaped his work in the foundations of quantum theory and
his complementary work in general methodology through his early work
(until after his break with Popper&rsquo;s school in December 1967):
How Bohr and the Bohrians initially reacted to David Bohm&rsquo;s
&ldquo;hidden variables&rdquo; proposal. While Bohr was puzzled and
somewhat taken aback by this amazing news, after he left the room, the
Bohrians were dismissive of Bohm&rsquo;s proposal, without good
grounds (invoking von Neumann&rsquo;s proof as a crutch). Bohm&rsquo;s
subsequent attempts to develop a &lsquo;hidden variables&rsquo;
interpretation of quantum theory in the face of von Neumann&rsquo;s
<em>alleged</em> proof that no deterministic completion by
&lsquo;hidden variables&rsquo; can be consistent with the principles
of quantum mechanics became a central focus of Feyerabend&rsquo;s work
in the foundations of quantum theory in the 1950s and 60s, as
Feyerabend repeatedly criticized the Copenhagen interpretation and
developed his own Bohrian proposal for handling the measurement
problem.</p>

<p>
Outside of physics, Feyerabend&rsquo;s principal intellectual
engagement in the late 1940s and early 1950s was in his capacity as
student leader of the &ldquo;Kraft Circle&rdquo;, which was a
philosophy club centered around Kraft, that became part of the
Austrian College Society (Kuby 2010). The Kraft Circle held regular
meetings from 1949 to 1952 (1978, p. 109), with the self-proscribed
task of &ldquo;considering philosophical problems in a nonmetaphysical
manner and with special reference to the findings of the
sciences&rdquo; (Feyerabend 1966a, pp. 1&ndash;2). Their main topic of
discussion concerned questions about the reality of theoretical
entities and the &ldquo;external world&rdquo;. As the student leader
of the Kraft circle, Feyerabend led the discussions, took notes, and
invited new participants. Bela Juhos, Walter Hollitscher, Georg Henrik
von Wright, and Elizabeth Anscombe were all visiting speakers.
Elizabeth Anscombe had come to Vienna to improve her German to
translate Wittgenstein&rsquo;s work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
She gave me manuscripts of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s later writings and
discussed them with me. The discussions extended over months and
occasionally proceeded from morning over lunch until late into the
evening. They had a profound influence upon me though it is not at all
easy to specify particulars (1978, p. 114).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, even Wittgenstein attended a meeting of
this &lsquo;third Vienna Circle&rsquo; (Stadler 2015) at
Feyerabend&rsquo;s invitation (Feyerabend 1995, pp. 74&ndash;76).
Feyerabend went to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s family home in Vienna to
invite him in person, but he was turned away. At the suggestion of
Anscombe&nbsp;(who admonished him against appearing sycophantic),
Feyerabend then succinctly invited Wittgenstein to come to a meeting
with a short note: &ldquo;We are discussing basic statements, and we
are stuck&rdquo;. Apparently, Wittgenstein could not pass up the
opportunity to criticize Popper&rsquo;s views. After arriving
belatedly (over an hour late), taking a seat, and listening to
Feyerabend (who was summarizing results of earlier discussions) for a
few moments, Wittgenstein abruptly interrupted:
&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Halt, so geht das nicht</em>&rsquo; (&lsquo;Stop,
that&rsquo;s not the way it is&rsquo;)&rdquo; and proceeded to discuss
what one sees through a microscope (Feyerabend 1995, p. 76).
Feyerabend later reported that Wittgenstein seemed to prefer their
disrespectful attitude to the fawning admiration he encountered
elsewhere. (1978, p. 109). And yet,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Not even a brief and quite interesting visit by Wittgenstein himself
[&hellip;] could advance our discussion. Wittgenstein was very
impressive in his way of presenting concrete cases, such as amoebas
under a microscope [&hellip;] but when he left we still did not know
whether or not there was an external world, or, if there was one, what
the arguments were in favor of it (Feyerabend 1966a, p. 4).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Feyerabend had originally planned to submit a thesis on
physics, after getting nowhere with the electrodynamics problem he had
chosen, he turned to philosophy to earn his degree. He revised his
Kraft circle discussion notes, which contained ideas and arguments
that were roughly the right length, and turned them into his doctoral
thesis, &ldquo;<em>Zur Theorie der Basiss&auml;tze</em>&rdquo;, which
he submitted in November 1951 under Kraft&rsquo;s supervision, (p.
115). Here, Feyerabend first delineated his peculiar views on meaning
and method. He may even have realized that they did not comport to
Popper&rsquo;s notion of neutral &lsquo;basic statements&rsquo; as the
empirical basis of science as the invitation to Wittgenstein would
seem to imply, although it would only be about a decade later that
Feyerabend openly criticized Popper&rsquo;s empiricism in
&ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a).</p>

<p>
In his 1951 Ph.D. thesis, Feyerabend first introduced his top-down
view of the meaning of observation statements, according to which the
meaning of any statement used to test a theory is determined by the
theory from which it is deduced and used to test, in contrast to
Carnap&rsquo;s dual language model, according to which observation
language gets it meaning from the observations, and is separate from
theoretical language, which gets its meaning from observation
language. Feyerabend&rsquo;s top-down account has the peculiar
consequence that one observation sentence makes two or more
incompatible statements depending on which theory is used to interpret
it. For example, the sentence &ldquo;the ball fell&rdquo; meant that
it was pushed by its impetus before it meant that it was pulled by
gravity. This Wittgensteinian insight laid the foundation for
Feyerabend&rsquo;s account of incommensurability, which he used to
criticize formal accounts of the growth of knowledge in
&ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a), arguing
that contemporary theories do not explain antiquated facts. It just
appears that way because we continue to use the same observation
sentences after scientific revolutions, when in fact, the same
sentences can be used to make two incompatible statements&ndash;
depending on which theory is used to interpret it, that is, from which
theory it is deduced, together with auxiliary assumptions, and used to
test. In this way, Feyerabend&rsquo;s early philosophical work
&ldquo;started from and returned to the discussion of protocol
statements in the Vienna Circle&rdquo; (Feyerabend 1991, p. 526).</p>

<h3 id="LifeLondSchoEcon1952">3.3 Life at the London School of Economics (1952&ndash;1953)</h3>

<p>
In Feyerabend&rsquo;s autobiography, we are told a little about
Popper&rsquo;s lectures and his famous LSE seminar. The lectures began
with the claim that there is no method in science, but that there
<em>are</em> some simple and helpful rules of thumb. Popper tried to
show &ldquo;how simple ideas that were derived from equally simple
requirements brought order into the complex world of research&rdquo;
(pp. 88&ndash;89). Having been convinced by Popper&rsquo;s and Pierre
Duhem&rsquo;s critiques of inductivism (the view that science proceeds
through generalization from facts recorded in experience), Feyerabend
considered falsificationism a real option, and, he says, he
&ldquo;fell for it&rdquo; applying falsificationism in his papers and
lectures (p. 89).</p>

<p>
Later Feyerabend saw this phase of his development as an example of
the dangers of abstract reasoning. Rationalism is already dangerous
since it &ldquo;paralyzes our judgment&rdquo; (p. 89) and is invested
with &ldquo;an almost superhuman authority&rdquo; (p. 90). But Popper
added a further dangerous element: <em>simplicity</em>. Such a
philosophy, complains Feyerabend, &ldquo;may be out of touch with
reality [&hellip; that is], with scientific practice&rdquo; (p.
90).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend had adopted Popper&rsquo;s normative approach to
epistemology. In chapter II of <em>Logik der Forschung</em> [<em>The
Logic of Scientific Discovery</em>] (1934, English 1959), Popper
distinguished between scientific practice and scientific standards,
principles, or methodology. He argued against a
&ldquo;naturalistic&rdquo; theory of method that makes standards
depend on practice, opting instead for a strongly normative
epistemology, a discipline that lays down ideals and methodological
rules for scientists to aspire to and ascribe to. This is one of the
most important aspects of the Popperian perspective that Feyerabend
initially took on board. He was trying to contribute to a normative
&ldquo;model for the acquisition of knowledge&rdquo; (see Preston
1997, p. 13) until he broke with the Popperian school in December
1967, reversing himself on realism in a &lsquo;historical
turn&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Such an epistemology, Feyerabend concluded, makes the false assumption
that &ldquo;rational&rdquo; standards can lead to a practice that is
as mobile, rich, and effective as the science we already have.
However, science did not develop according to Popper&rsquo;s model and
falsificationism does not promote scientific progress,
but&nbsp;stifles it. It stifles progress by sharing a dogmatic feature
with school philosophies (the assumption of meaning invariance). If
new theoretical proposals have to predict the accepted observation
statements to justify replacing established theories, then scientific
revolutions that change the meaning of those statements would be
impossible to justify (Feyerabend 1962a). After his epiphany in 1967,
Feyerabend generalized his criticism, arguing that while science is
not &lsquo;irrational&rsquo;, it contains no overarching
&lsquo;rational&rsquo; pattern (as Otto Neurath had argued, p. 91).
Rationalism (Popper&rsquo;s included) could produce a science, but not
the progressive science we actually have.</p>

<p>
In 1952, Feyerabend focused on two topics: the foundations of quantum
theory (von Neumann and Bohm) and Wittgenstein (p. 92).
Feyerabend&rsquo;s work on Wittgenstein from a Popperian perspective
led to his views on meaning and method. He presented his ideas on
scientific change to Popper&rsquo;s LSE seminar and to a gathering of
illustrious Wittgensteinians (Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, H. L.
A. Hart, and Georg Henrik von Wright) in Anscombe&rsquo;s Oxford flat,
which he then repeated in Popper&rsquo;s LSE seminar. These meetings
seem to have been the first English presentations of his central idea
that some scientific theories are
&lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo;<em>,</em> although that term appeared in
his publications only a decade later (see Oberheim 2005):</p>

<blockquote>
On one occasion which I remember vividly Anscombe, by a series of
skilful questions, made me see how our conception (and even our
perceptions) of well-defined and apparently self-contained facts may
depend on circumstances not apparent in them. There are entities such
as physical objects which obey a &ldquo;conservation principle&rdquo;
in the sense that they retain their identity through a variety of
manifestations and even when they are not present at all while other
entities such as pains and after-images are &ldquo;annihilated&rdquo;
with their disappearance. The conservation principles may change from
one developmental stage of the human organism to another and they may
be different for different languages (cf. Whorf&rsquo;s &ldquo;covert
classifications&rdquo; [&hellip;]). I conjectured that such principles
would play an important role in science, that they might change during
revolutions and that deductive relations between pre-revolutionary and
post-revolutionary theories might be broken off as a result (1978, p.
115).

<p>
Major discoveries, I said, are not like the discovery of America,
where the general nature of the discovered object is already known.
Rather, they are like recognizing that one has been dreaming (p.
92).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These thoughts received an unenthusiastic reception from Hart, von
Wright, and Popper (p. 92). Feyerabend scrutinized the manuscript that
became the <em>Philosophische Untersuchungen</em> [<em>Philosophical
Investigations</em>], while visiting Anscombe in London: &ldquo;Being
of a pedantic turn of mind&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;I rewrote the book
so that it looked more like a treatise with a continuous
argument&rdquo; (1978, p. 116).</p>

<p>
Anscombe translated Feyerabend&rsquo;s critical reconstruction into
English and sent it to <em>The Philosophical Review</em>. This became
Feyerabend&rsquo;s first English-language publication, which he called
his &ldquo;Wittgensteinian monster&rdquo; (p. 115). He later
commented:</p>

<blockquote>
I knew that Wittgenstein did not want to present a theory (of
knowledge, or language), and I did not expressly formulate a theory
myself. But my arrangements made the text speak like a theory and
falsified Wittgenstein&rsquo;s intentions (p. 93).

<p>
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s emphasis on the need for concrete research and
his objections to abstract reasoning (&ldquo;Look, don&rsquo;t
think!&rdquo;) somewhat clashed with my own inclinations and the
papers in which his influence is noticeable are therefore mixtures of
concrete examples and sweeping principles (1978, p. 115).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his review of the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, he
reconstructed Wittgenstein&rsquo;s critique of a family of
&ldquo;realist&rdquo; or &ldquo;essentialist&rdquo; theories of
meaning according to which the meaning of a word is the object
designated or referred to by that word. Feyerabend argued that
Wittgenstein was attempting a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of realist
theories of meaning, showing that they had the untenable implication
that we could not be said to know the meaning of words that we
nevertheless constantly use in totally unproblematic ways. While he
defended Wittgenstein&rsquo;s semantic views (adopting and developing
the implications of the contextual theory of meaning he read into
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s work), he harshly rejected Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
conception of philosophy as pure &ldquo;philosophical analysis&rdquo;
of genuinely philosophical (pseudo-) problems. Feyerabend abhorred
philosophy that <em>merely</em> leaves everything as it is, relegated
to <em>merely</em> letting flies out of bottles. Philosophy should be
progressive. It should contribute to improving our understanding and
the human condition, not to the dangerous entrenchment of the status
quo. At the same time, Feyerabend did not only endorse
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s conception of genuinely philosophical (pseudo-)
problems, he tried to specify their source, as well as to show how
their clarification can lead to progress. They are caused by
incompatible rules of usage implied by incommensurable, antiquated
scientific theories. Such problems are dissolved by reforming everyday
language according to our best theories.</p>

<p>
In a short article published the next year (1956), Feyerabend expanded
on his critique, arguing that consideration of G. E. Moore&rsquo;s
famous &ldquo;paradox of analysis&rdquo; showed that
&ldquo;<em>philosophy cannot be analytic and scientific</em>, i.e.,
interesting, progressive, about a certain subject matter, informative
<em>at the same time</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Note on the Paradox of
Analysis&rdquo;, 1956a, p. 95). Feyerabend thenceforth plumped for
(what he conceived of as) <em>scientific</em> philosophy. Like Popper,
he increasingly adamantly rejected &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; philosophy
or the &ldquo;linguistic&rdquo; philosophy which followed in
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s wake, and with which Oxford University dominated
the philosophical scene in the 1950s and early 1960s.</p>

<p>
One of the things that comes across most clearly from his
autobiography is the consistently malleable nature of
Feyerabend&rsquo;s views. He records that his friend Agassi caused him
completely to change his mind about a book he considered translating.
When Agassi urged Feyerabend to become a faithful Popperian,
Feyerabend&rsquo;s resistance seems to have been based mainly on his
aversion to groups more than his vague feeling that there was some
kind of problem with Popper&rsquo;s account.</p>

<h3 id="RetuVien1953">3.4 Return to Vienna (1953&ndash;1955)</h3>

<p>
By the summer of 1953, when Popper had to apply for extra funds to
allow Feyerabend to work as his assistant, Feyerabend had decided to
take a leave from the Popperian church and return to Vienna. Although
the assistantship was soon approved, Feyerabend &ldquo;felt quite
uncomfortable. I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it; I only knew that
I wanted to remain in Vienna&rdquo; (p. 99).</p>

<p>
During this period Feyerabend translated Popper&rsquo;s &ldquo;war
effort&rdquo;, <em>The Open Society and its Enemies</em>, wrote
articles on &ldquo;Methodology&rdquo; and &ldquo;Philosophy of
Nature&rdquo; for a French encyclopedia, produced a report on post-war
developments in the Humanities in Austria for the U.S. Library of
Congress, and made a mess of his first professional opportunity as a
singer (p. 98). But he also felt that he did not know what to do in
the long run, so he applied for jobs at various universities.</p>

<p>
He met Arthur Pap, &ldquo;who had come to Vienna to lecture on
analytic philosophy and who hoped, perhaps somewhat unrealistically,
that he would be able to revive what was left from the great years of
the Vienna Circle and the analytic tradition there&rdquo; (1966a, p.
3). Feyerabend became Pap&rsquo;s assistant. Pap arranged for him to
meet Herbert Feigl in Vienna in 1954, and together they studied
Feigl&rsquo;s papers. Feigl had been a member of the Vienna Circle
until he emigrated to the USA in 1930, but he had never given up the
&ldquo;realist&rdquo; view that there is a knowable external world. He
convinced Feyerabend that the positivism of Kraft and Pap had not
solved the traditional problems of philosophy. His paper
&ldquo;Existential Hypotheses&rdquo; (1950), together with
Kraft&rsquo;s contributions and certain ideas Popper had put forward
at Alpbach in 1948 and 1949, greatly diminished Feyerabend&rsquo;s
doubts about realism (1966a, p. 4). Here is how Feyerabend recounts
Feigl&rsquo;s influence:</p>

<blockquote>
It was [&hellip;] quite a shock to hear Feigl expound fundamental
difficulties and to hear him explain in perfectly simple language
without any recourse to formalism why the problem of application [of
the probability-calculus] was still without a solution. Formalization,
then, was not the last word in philosophical matters. There was still
room for fundamental discussion-for speculation (dreaded word!); there
was still a possibility of overthrowing highly formalized systems with
the help of a little common sense! (1966a, p. 5).

<h3 id="FirsAcadAppoUnivBris1955">4.1 First Academic Appointment: The University of Bristol (1955&ndash;1958)</h3>

<p>
In 1955, with the help of references from Popper and Erwin
Schr&ouml;dinger, as well as his own big mouth (p. 102, 1978, p. 116),
Feyerabend secured his first academic post lecturing in the philosophy
of science at the University of Bristol, England. In his autobiography
(pp. 103&ndash;4) he describes how Agassi had to help him prepare for
these lectures since they covered a subject Feyerabend claimed he had
never studied (1978, p. 116). He also describes how for some time he
felt directionless and unsettled: he was &ldquo;killing
time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In the summer of that year, he again visited Alpbach, where he met the
physicist and mathematician, Philipp Frank (another former member of
the Vienna circle), who exerted on him a (somewhat delayed)
influence:</p>

<blockquote>
Frank argued that the Aristotelian objections against Copernicus
agreed with empiricism, while Galileo&rsquo;s law of inertia did not.
As in other cases, this remark lay dormant in my mind for years; then
it started festering. The Galileo chapters of <em>Against Method</em>
are a late result (p. 103. See also 1978, p. 112).
</blockquote>

<p>
At the turn of 1956, Feyerabend launched a weekly lecture course in
Bristol on the foundations of quantum mechanics, which he remembered
as being a disaster. Directly before the first meeting, he reversed
himself on indeterminism in the quantum theory, adopting
Popper&rsquo;s view that it can be derived from (and so is nothing
more special than) classical indeterminacy (something Popper,
throughout his work on the foundations of quantum theory tried, but
ultimately, failed to prove). Feyerabend excitedly published
&ldquo;Eine Bemerkung zum Neumannschen Beweis&rdquo; [A Remark on von
Neumann&rsquo;s Proof] (Feyerabend 1956b). Popper immediately
privately accused Feyerabend of plagiarism, insisting Feyerabend write
to the editors and have them add a note giving himself and Agassi
credit for the ideas. Feyerabend initially agreed to write to the
editors and have them add such a note, but then he thought better of
it and told Popper that it was too late. By adopting Popper&rsquo;s
view on the foundations of quantum theory, however briefly, Feyerabend
(it seemed to Popper), was getting way out ahead of his own
&ldquo;propensity interpretation&rdquo;, which Popper only publicly
launched at the Colston Research Society symposium in 1957 (through
Feyerabend, who read Popper&rsquo;s paper <em>in absentia</em>). In
any case, it was a short-lived reversal for Feyerabend, who quickly
returned to what he had been arguing before concerning von
Neumann&rsquo;s proof. By January 1957, Feyerabend made his discomfort
about his published &lsquo;Remark&rsquo; very clear in a letter to
Popper: &ldquo;if I am right your and Joske&rsquo;s [Agassi] criticism
[of von Neumann] which I have adopted myself [in Feyerabend 1956b] is
wrong&rdquo;. It now seemed to Feyerabend once again that &ldquo;there
is much more behind [von Neumann&rsquo;s] proof than you [Popper] were
inclined to admit&rdquo; (Collodel and Oberheim eds. 2020, p.
248).</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1956, along with Alfred Land&eacute;, he chaired a
successful seminar on philosophical issues in quantum mechanics at
Alpbach. He also got married for the second time. This time to one of
his former students, Mary O&rsquo;Neill. But this relationship seems
to have been very short-lived, for he reports that his wife spent
Christmas 1957 away from him with her parents, that she subsequently
had an affair, and that the last time he saw her was 1958.</p>

<p>
In 1957, Feyerabend met David Bohm, triggering several related crucial
events that laid the foundations for Feyerabend&rsquo;s philosophical
development to come. Bohm had been the favored prot&eacute;g&eacute;
of Robert Oppenheimer and had contributed to the Manhattan Project in
Oak Ridge, Tennessee (his doctoral work on scattering had been
classified), before he went to work with Albert Einstein (who became
his new mentor), at Princeton in 1947. In 1951, Bohm fled from
McCarthyism to South America (1951&ndash;55) and then Israel
(1955&ndash;1957), before arriving in Bristol. Feyerabend studied
Bohm&rsquo;s dialectical conception of science and reality and
Bohm&rsquo;s methodological views on the foundations of quantum theory
immediately after Bohm&rsquo;s <em>Causality and Chance in Modern</em>
<em>Physics</em> (1957) became available, on the eve of the ninth
symposium of the Colston Research Society in April, &ldquo;Observation
and Interpretation&rdquo;, that Feyerabend had helped organize. At the
symposium, Feyerabend gave a paper &ldquo;On the Quantum Theory of
Measurement&rdquo; that sets out his Bohrian strategy for handling the
measurement problem in the foundations of quantum theory, which he
developed in a series of papers criticizing the Copenhagen
interpretation (not Bohr himself, who had proposed such an approach,
as Feyerabend, to his chagrin, only found out at the conference)
published in 1957, 1958, 1962, 1968, and 1969 (see Kuby 2021 and van
Strien 2020). Feyerabend also emphasized what was to become a
long-running central theme in his work: that there is no separate,
neutral &ldquo;observation language&rdquo; or &ldquo;everyday
language&rdquo; against which the theoretical statements of science
are tested, but that &ldquo;the everyday level is <em>part of</em> the
theoretical rather than something self-contained and
independent&rdquo; (1981, p. 217, emphasis added). This view
represents a decisive break with Carnap and the logical positivist
conception of theories. It led Feyerabend to the idea of
incommensurability, with which he eventually criticized Popper&rsquo;s
empiricism.</p>

<p>
Moreover, during the discussions of the symposium, Feyerabend
championed Bohm&rsquo;s cause and his plea for more tolerance and
pluralism in the foundation of quantum theory. Bohm and Vigier were
criticized for re-introducing untestable metaphysics into science so
that the quantum of action becomes derivative. However, Bohm and
Vigier saw nothing wrong with their <em>ad hoc</em> strategy, which
introduces &lsquo;hidden variables&rsquo; (a sub-quantum fluid, giving
rise to quantum indeterminacy as a second, lower-level form of
Brownian motion) to explain the known results. After all, as they
pointed out, the kinetic theory of heat was <em>ad hoc</em> and relied
on such hidden variables (in this case atoms) until it was empirically
corroborated by Einstein&rsquo;s prediction of the stochastic
character of Brownian motion, ending classical phenomenological
thermodynamics and Energeticism. Perhaps another Einstein might come
along and do the same for their theory (think up an independent test
corroborating it). This is how Bohm&rsquo;s defense of the <em>ad
hoc</em> strategy they were using to support his (and Vigier&rsquo;s)
1954 sub-quantum fluid proposal, as illustrated by Einstein&rsquo;s
prediction of the stochastic character of (classical) Brownian motion,
became Feyerabend&rsquo;s methodological argument for theoretical
pluralism as illustrated by the same example. Feyerabend&rsquo;s
argument based on this example became the centerpiece of his work in
the philosophy of science from &ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and
Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a) through <em>Against Method</em> (1993).</p>

<p>
When Feyerabend finally finished drafting a long-planned critical
study of Bohm&rsquo;s 1957 book <em>Causality and Chance in Modern
Physics</em> in 1959 (see Feyerabend 1960), he was still very much
under Popper&rsquo;s influence. The essay review is a detailed
critical comparison of Bohm&rsquo;s methodology (&lsquo;the
qualitative infinity of nature&rsquo;) with Popper&rsquo;s
falsificationism, with Feyerabend bluntly concluding: &ldquo;I cannot
accept Bohm&rsquo;s methodology of caution [&hellip;] I prefer
[&hellip;] the methodology of falsification as it has been developed
by Popper&rdquo; (1960, p. 339), while definitively rejecting
&ldquo;the epistemology behind Bohm&rsquo;s belief that every theory,
however absurd it may seem at first sight, has some kind of truth in
it and correctly mirrors what exists in the universe&rdquo; (1960, p.
337).</p>

<p>
However, Bohm&rsquo;s (unpublished) response to Feyerabend&rsquo;s
criticism of falsificationism motivated Feyerabend&rsquo;s criticism
of Popper&rsquo;s empiricism in &ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and
Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a). In this collage of his earlier
publications, Feyerabend built on his peculiar ideas on meaning and
method by adopting and developing Bohm&rsquo;s argument for pluralism
and Bohm&rsquo;s plea for more tolerance towards his views based on
the Brownian motion example. He used them to criticize Popper&rsquo;s
empiricism while illustrating how there can still be a crucial
experiment between incommensurable alternatives despite the lack of
formal relation between their corresponding predictions required for a
falsification. Bohm increasingly became a central figure in
Feyerabend&rsquo;s formative development, leading him away from
Popper&rsquo;s empiricism, towards Bohm&rsquo;s dialectical views on
scientific progress and the qualitative infinity of nature, such as
ontological pluralism and the non-autonomy of facts. In the long run,
with the publication of his collected papers in 1981, Feyerabend
retracted his Popperian criticism of Bohm&rsquo;s views. Bohm and
Feyerabend&rsquo;s ideas continued to converge, including their shared
interests in &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; science, as Bohm&rsquo;s dialectical
ideas continued to have visible effects on Feyerabend&rsquo;s
published productions (see Feyerabend 1966b; Collodel and Oberheim
2024). Most notably, Feyerabend increasingly openly flirts with a
Hegelian ontology, according to which reality is co-constituted by
subject-sided and object-sided moments &mdash; as can be seen by
comparing Bohm&rsquo;s view on the qualitative infinity of nature with
Feyerabend&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kant-on-wheels&rsquo; ontology (see Oberheim
2016) which remains intact from &ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and
Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a) to <em>The</em> <em>Conquest of
Abundance</em> (1999).</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1957, Feyerabend accepted an invitation to visit
Feigl&rsquo;s Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science in
Minneapolis. The Center was, as Feyerabend later said, &ldquo;one of
the foremost institutions in the field&rdquo; (p. 115). There he met
Carl Hempel, Ernest Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Adolf Gr&uuml;nbaum, Grover
Maxwell, E. L. Hill, Paul Meehl, and others. He returned to the Center
in 1958, having accepted another invitation to work there, backed by
an NSF grant. He often returned in subsequent years, as Feigl
continued to promote Feyerabend&rsquo;s career and his engagement with
the leading philosophers of science in North America.</p>

<h3 id="UnivCaliBerkEarlYear1958">4.2 The University of California at Berkeley: Early Years (1958&ndash;1964)</h3>

<p>
In 1958, Feyerabend accepted an invitation to spend a year at the
University of California at Berkeley, after which the University
administration decided to give him tenure based on his publications
and, of course, his big mouth (p. 115). After his repeated visits to
Minnesota Center, he started lecturing full-time at Berkeley in 1960,
where in the autumn of that year, he met Thomas Kuhn. They quickly
became close compatriots, and Kuhn gave Feyerabend a draft of <em>The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962). They were soon to
become very closely associated, often recognized together for having
independently introduced the idea of incommensurability into
discussions of scientific progress in 1962 publications. They are also
often lumped together as having initiated the movement away from a
logic-oriented, to a historically oriented, approach to the philosophy
of science, as well as among the &ldquo;worst enemies of
science&rdquo; (together with Popper, see Lamb, Munevar, and Preston
eds. 2000) because they all reject the claim that theories can be
proven to be true, opening the door to relativism. For these reasons,
it can be surprising to learn that after their brief initial robust
personal engagement that ended in the fall of 1961, direct discussion
of the deep affinities in their ideas was set back by a rift in their
relations that lasted about two decades&nbsp;(until&nbsp;1983, see
Collodel and Oberheim&nbsp;2024). At the time, Feyerabend was deeply
immersed in normative epistemology. He wrote a series of scathing
letters criticizing Kuhn&rsquo;s historical approach, even accusing
Kuhn of intentionally misleading his readers. He acerbically attacked
Kuhn&rsquo;s defense of &lsquo;normal science&rsquo; as a pernicious
form of dogmatism, and vehemently challenged Kuhn&rsquo;s use of
purportedly neutral historical facts given the normative implications
of his account. For Feyerabend: &ldquo;What you [Kuhn] are writing is
not just history. It is ideology covered up as history&rdquo;
(Collodel and Oberheim eds. 2024, p. 232) Feyerabend&rsquo;s
persistent, caustic criticisms of Kuhn and his work, especially the
recurrent accusation that he was promoting a dogmatic, conservative
ideology, led to a break in personal contact that lasted about two
decades &ndash; until their gradual rapprochement beginning in 1983.
Thus, while Kuhn and Feyerabend were perceived to be ushering in the
historical turn together over the next two decades, actually they had
broken off personal contact when Kuhn left Berkeley at the end of
1961, fueled by Feyerabend&rsquo;s harsh criticism of Kuhn&rsquo;s
historical approach and what became Kuhn&rsquo;s most prominent work
(see Collodel and Oberheim 2024. For the full surviving
Feyerabend-Kuhn correspondence, see Collodel and Oberheim eds. 2024).
According to Feyerabend&rsquo;s normative approach, there are no
neutral facts. Epistemology should result from ethical decisions about
the kind of knowledge we want to have. Science and methodology are
what we make them, and what we make of them. We should want to have a
progressive science because the alternative is dogmatic ideology,
which is dangerous. After all, it can quickly devolve into intolerance
and ultimately violence. As the German saying paradoxically puts it:
&ldquo;<em>Der Weg ist das Ziel</em>&rdquo; [the route is the
destination, implying the goal is to stay on the path] so as not to
become entrenched as dogmatic ideology.</p>

<p>
From 1958 through 1967, Feyerabend developed his normative approach to
epistemology in a series of papers on problems of empiricism that
attempted to contribute to a positive model for the acquisition of
knowledge. In these papers, he unpacks the consequences of
his&nbsp;views on meaning and method, while criticizing his
contemporaries&rsquo; accounts. These strange ideas emerged from his
earlier engagement with the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s protocol sentence
debate and appear in their initial form in his 1951 Ph.D. thesis. They
were initially published in English as &ldquo;An Attempt at a
Realistic Interpretation of Experience&rdquo; (1958), which primarily
targets logical positivism and Carnap&rsquo;s dual language model.
&ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a) sets out
his mature early view by drawing together his work in analytic
philosophy, general methodology, and the foundations of quantum
theory. Feyerabend also adds new critical targets (Popper included)
and proposes a new test model for comparing incommensurable theories,
launching his oft-repeated methodological argument for theoretical
pluralism. Subsequent major papers written in the 1960s before his
reversal in December 1967 develop particular aspects, and further
consequences of, his early views, while responding to criticisms.
&ldquo;How to be a Good Empiricist&rdquo; (1963a) is &ldquo;A Plea for
Tolerance in Matters Epistemological&rdquo; that stresses the
non-autonomy of facts (facts do not exist independently of theories).
&ldquo;Realism and Instrumentalism: Comments on the Logic of Factual
Support&rdquo; (1964) goes deeper into the issue of realism as an
ideal and his normative argument for it. In 1965, Feyerabend tried to
clarify his contentious views in &ldquo;On the &lsquo;Meaning&rsquo;
of Scientific Terms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reply to Criticism: Comments on
Smart, Sellars and Putnam&rdquo;. His early views culminate in two
papers: &ldquo;Problems of Empiricism&rdquo; (1965), which is a
lengthy paper that sets out the &ldquo;ever-expanding ocean of
alternatives&rdquo; (pp. 224&ndash;225) account of progress and his
belatedly published (written before his December 1967 reversal)
&ldquo;Linguistic Arguments and Scientific Method&rdquo; (1969), which
emphasizes his view that common knowledge and everyday language should
be corrected by our current best scientific theories as part of
scientific progress &ndash; and not merely analyzed &ndash; which
permeates his early work, until he reversed himself in December
1967.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An Attempt at a Realistic Interpretation of Experience&rdquo;
(1958) explains Feyerabend&rsquo;s peculiar views on meaning and
method. Feyerabend argues that good science should be an attempt at a
realistic <em>re-</em>interpretation of experience. Our best
scientific theories should be used to correct common knowledge and
everyday language as part of progress. Specifically, he criticizes the
logical positivist conception of meaning and Carnap&rsquo;s dual
language model of theoretical systems, arguing that they have
consequences &ldquo;at variance with scientific method and reasonable
philosophy&rdquo; (1981, p. 17). This launches his signature
two-pronged (descriptive and normative) argumentative strategy,
according to which an account is historically inaccurate and
normatively undesirable because it would stifle progress. According to
Feyerabend, positivist theories imply the &ldquo;stability
thesis&rdquo;: Even major changes in theory (scientific revolutions)
will not affect the meanings of terms in the observation language.
Against this supposition, Feyerabend defended what he called
&ldquo;Thesis I&rdquo;, the idea that</p>

<blockquote>
<em>the interpretation of an observation-language is determined by the
theories which we use to explain what we observe, and it changes as
soon as those theories change</em> (1958, p. 31).
</blockquote>

<p>
Thesis I reverses the flow of meaning from what positivism
presupposes. Instead of meaning seeping upwards from observation
language to theoretical language (as logical positivism and
Carnap&rsquo;s dual language model would have it), Feyerabend,
following Wittgenstein&rsquo;s remarks and Gestalt psychology, argues
that meaning trickles down from theory to experience. Theories inform
experience, not vice-versa. This view results from combining a
contextual theory of meaning, according to which meaning is conferred
on terms by the theory used to interpret them, with Popper&rsquo;s
&ldquo;hypothetico-deductive model&rdquo; of theory testing. For an
observation statement to be used to test a theory, it must be deduced
from that theory, and so it must have the meaning conferred on it by
that theory. Therefore, when theories change, the meanings of the
observations used to test them change.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend also argues that the idea that the interpretation of
observation terms does not depend upon the status of our theoretical
knowledge has undesirable consequences for positivists. It implies
that &ldquo;every positivistic observation language is based upon a
metaphysical ontology&rdquo; (<em>Philosophical Papers, Volume 1</em>,
p. 21). If observation language gets its meaning directly from
experience, then the observation language becomes untestable. In
contrast, according to Feyerabend&rsquo;s realism, &ldquo;the
interpretation of a scientific theory depends upon nothing but the
state of affairs it describes&rdquo; (<em>Philosophical Papers, Volume
1</em>, p. 42). Unlike positivism, which conflicts with science by
taking experiences as given, unanalyzable building blocks, realism
treats experiences as analyzable, as the result of processes not
immediately accessible to observation, so that the observations
statements that they prompt can and should be tested and improved.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;<em>Das Problem der Existenz theoretischer
Entit&auml;ten</em>&rdquo; (1960) [On the Problem of the Existence of
Theoretical Entities] (for an English translation, see Feyerabend
1999), Feyerabend concludes that there is no special problem
concerning the existence of theoretical entities, as all entities are
theoretical. If, as the contextual theory implies, the meanings of
observation statements depend on the principles of the theories used
to explain them, inadequacies in these principles will be transmitted
to the observation statements that they subtend, whence our beliefs
about what is observed may be in error so that even our experiences
themselves can and should be criticized and improved as we improve our
conception of reality. Instead of passively accepting observation
statements as given, we should attempt to find and test the
theoretical principles implicit in them, which may lead to changes to
those principles. This is part of Feyerabend&rsquo;s conception of
scientific philosophy (see &ldquo;<em>Physik und Ontologie</em>&rdquo;
1954), as part of ontology (the study of the implications our theories
have concerning the nature of reality), which is how metaphysical
speculation can become testable.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a),
Feyerabend develops his view that revolutionary new theories are
incommensurable with established views. They are logically disjoint
(&lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo;) due to meaning variance in the
non-logical terms used to state the rival theories, which results in
meaning variance in the observation statements used to test them.
Feyerabend was trying to develop Wittgenstein&rsquo;s insights into
observation language within the context of Popper&rsquo;s critical
rationalist philosophy in a critical synthesis that develops the best
from both while criticizing the worst in each. From Wittgenstein,
Feyerabend develops a contextual theory of meaning according to which
our theories determine the meaning of observation statements;
specifically the insight that one observation sentence makes two
incompatible statements depending on which theory is used to interpret
it. For example, in the transition to classical mechanics, &lsquo;The
ball fell&rsquo; was used to test and corroborate competing theories
of motion, but it was used to make two incompatible statements (that
it was pushed from within or pulled from outside). Feyerabend
concluded that revolutionary new theories do not explain established
facts. They replace them. For example, relativity theory does not
explain classical facts. It replaces them with relativistic facts and
classical facts should become antiquated.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend also adds three new critical targets, mirroring the title
(Hempel on explanation, Nagel on reduction, and then Popper on
empiricism). Feyerabend criticizes Hempel&rsquo;s account of
explanation because it implies that to justify the replacement of an
established explanation, the new explanation should explain everything
explained by the established one, plus something more. However,
according to Feyerabend, in revolutions, meaning variance renders
rival explanations logically disjoint, so the new explanation does
not, and cannot, explain the same observation statements already
explained. The new explanation may explain&nbsp;the same observation
<em>sentences</em>, but it does so by reinterpreting them
into&nbsp;incompatible observation <em>statements</em>. Progress has
been made without meeting Hempel&rsquo;s criteria, which are too
conservative, because they would make the justification of
revolutionary new explanations impossible, and so stifle progress.
Feyerabend then criticizes Nagel&rsquo;s account of inter-theoretic
reduction for the same reason, coming to the same conclusion. In
revolutions, meaning variance renders rival theories logically
disjoint, so formal relations cannot be used to explain (by reduction)
established theories as special cases (as Nagel suggests), so
suggesting that they should have to, to be satisfactory as
replacements, stifles progress. Finally, setting up the main
conclusion of the paper, Feyerabend criticizes his interpretation of
Popper&rsquo;s empiricism (today known as
&lsquo;falsificationism&rsquo;) for the same reason, concluding that
Popper&rsquo;s empiricism also shares the same undesirable feature
with dogmatic school philosophies as Hempel and Nagel&rsquo;s accounts
(1962a, pp. 30&ndash;31). It cannot take incommensurability into
account (Feyerabend 1962a, p. 93), because there can be no formally
comparable consequences (observational or otherwise) deduced from
incommensurable alternatives (Feyerabend 1962a, p. 94). The new theory
should not have to successfully predict (by deduction) all of the
existing theories&rsquo; correct predictions plus more (Hempel&rsquo;s
criteria for a more comprehensive explanation), plus an observation
statement that formally contradicts one of the established
theories&rsquo; unsuccessful predictions (the falsifier). This is not
what has happened in revolutionary advances (which result in meaning
variance), and these criteria are normatively undesirable because they
set an impossibly high bar for justifying revolutionary new proposals,
inhibiting progress.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend&rsquo;s criticism of these three new main targets (he also
repeats his usual criticism of Carnap, the Copenhagen interpretation,
and mentions a few others) is used to support the main contention of
the paper, which is that, more generally, a formal account of
reduction and explanation is impossible (because of meaning variance
that results in incommensurability). Revolutionary new theories do not
explain antiquated facts.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend was developing Popper&rsquo;s view that increasing
testability increases empirical content and promotes progress through
a process of conjectures and refutations. Feyerabend argues that
Popper&rsquo;s empiricism has only a limited validity. It is limited
to testing commensurable theories. While Newton&rsquo;s theory
falsified Kepler&rsquo;s (commensurable) laws in this Popperian
fashion, relativity theory does not falsify classical mechanics
because meaning variance renders them incommensurable, precluding the
formal relation (consistency and inconsistency) between the
corresponding observation statements deduced from each theory needed
for a falsification. More generally, instead of Popper&rsquo;s
conjectures and refutations (which only works for comparing
commensurable theories within shared theoretical frameworks), in
revolutions, it is conjectures and novel theory-laden corroborations,
as illustrated by the Brownian motion example. The example purportedly
shows that Brownian motion only indirectly refuted classical
phenomenological thermodynamics once it was successfully predicted
(and thereby potentially explained) by the kinetic theory of heat. The
phenomenological theory was not refuted by predictions deduced from it
that logically contradict predictions deduced from the kinetic theory
that were corroborated. It was abandoned because the ontology it
implies is incompatible with the ontology implied by a better
corroborated new theory. The conclusion that there is no absolute mass
because mass is relative to motion was justified by the corroboration
of relativity theory, not by a falsification of classical mechanics.
This test model became the basis for his methodological argument for
theoretical pluralism, which became the centerpiece of his work in
philosophy of science through <em>Against Method</em> (1993). The
argument is that no matter how successful an established theory is,
new theoretical proposals should always be welcome (and pluralism
should be the norm) because sometimes the fact that some observations
refute an established view can only be established by developing an
incommensurable alternative to the established view.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend also explains Wittgenstein&rsquo;s illusive
&lsquo;grammar&rsquo; as the source of genuinely philosophical
problems as the tension between the semantic principles implied by
contemporary views and the semantic principles implied by antiquated
scientific theories that continue to haunt everyday language because
we continue to use many of the same terms and sentences after a
revolution but with new, incompatible meanings. However, against
Wittgenstein (and linguistic philosophy more generally), Feyerabend
argues that dissolution through clarification of such problems is
often crucial to scientific advance and that common knowledge and
everyday language should be corrected according to our best theories
to avoid stifling scientific advance. For example, the mind-body
problem may perhaps dissolve by progress in cognitive psychology that
results in eliminative materialism (see Shaw 2021a).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend also introduces what is sometimes called his Kant-on-wheels
ontology (see Oberheim 2016):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
scientific theories are ways of looking at the world; and their
adoption affects our general beliefs and expectations, and thereby
also our experiences and our conception of reality. We may even say
that what is regarded as &lsquo;nature&rsquo; at a particular time is
our <em>own</em> product in the sense that all the features ascribed
to it have first been invented by us and then used for bringing order
into our surroundings. As is well known, it was Kant who most
forcefully stated and investigated this all-pervasive character of
theoretical assumptions. However, Kant also thought that the very
generality of such assumptions and their omnipresence would forever
prevent them from being refuted. As opposed to this, the second idea
implicit in the position to be defended here demands that our theories
be <em>testable</em> and that they be abandoned as soon as [they fail]
a test (1962a, p. 29),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
so that science proceeds to &ldquo;better and better theories&rdquo;
(p. 30). Feyerabend also develops his contrastive, historical accounts
of empirical content and knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The use of a set of theories with the properties indicated above
[mutually incompatible, but factually adequate (p. 50)] will also
improve our understanding of each of its members by making it very
clear what is denied by the theory that happens to be accepted in the
end (p. 67).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Any attempt to reduce this class [of theories that are mutually
incompatible, but factually adequate] to a single theory would result
in a decisive decrease of the empirical content of this remaining
theory and would therefore be undesirable from the point of view of
empiricism. The freedom granted by the indeterminateness of facts is
therefore not only psychologically important [&hellip;] it is also
needed for methodological reasons (p. 50).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Relativity theory is better understood in contrast to classical
mechanics, which become part of its empirical content (as part of the
set of statements ruled out by it).</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How to be a Good Empiricist&rdquo; (1963a) is supposed to be a
simplified summary of his earlier work, especially &ldquo;Explanation,
Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962a) and &ldquo;Problems of
Microphysics&rdquo; (1962b). Feyerabend argues for pluralism and makes
a plea for more tolerance in matters of epistemology, mirroring his
specific call for more tolerance towards Bohm&rsquo;s proposal and his
criticism of the hegemony of the Copenhagen interpretation (not
Bohr&rsquo;s view, which Feyerabend was following) in the foundations
of quantum theory. Feyerabend emphasizes the relative nature of facts
(which Bohm also emphasizes) that results from his Kant-on-wheels
ontology, according to which there are classical facts and
relativistic facts, depending on which theory is used to explain them.
He claimed the most significant insight of his early philosophy is his
rejection of the &lsquo;autonomy principle&rsquo;, according to which
facts exist and are available independently of whether or not one
considers alternatives to the theory to be tested (1963a).</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Mental Events and the Brain&rdquo; (1963b) and
&ldquo;Materialism and the Mind-Body Problem&rdquo; (1963c),
Feyerabend applied his ideas to the mind-body problem arguing that the
distinction between mental and physical results from principles that
derived from an incommensurable antiquated scientific theory. The
clash between those principles and contemporary physicalism results in
a genuinely philosophical (pseudo-) problem in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
sense: the mind-body problem. He sought to undermine the supposition
that the mind cannot be a physical thing by promoting the possibility
of <em>&ldquo;eliminative materialism&rdquo;</em> illustrating how
common knowledge and everyday language should be reformed to reflect
the current state of scientific knowledge. Feyerabend&rsquo;s radical
&lsquo;eliminative materialist&rsquo; proposal was taken up by Richard
Rorty and Paul and Patricia Churchland, becoming an important
legacy.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Realism and Instrumentalism: Comments on the Logic of
Factual Support&rdquo; (1964) Feyerabend applied his normative
approach to the dispute about how best to interpret scientific
theories, arguing that the disagreement between realists and
instrumentalists is not a factual issue, but a matter of choice. We
can choose to see theories either as descriptions of reality
(scientific realism) or as instruments of prediction
(instrumentalism), depending on what ideals of scientific knowledge we
aspire to. Adherence to these competing ideals (high informative
content on the one hand, and the certainty of our senses, on the
other) is to be judged by their respective consequences. Stressing
that philosophical theories have not merely reflected science but have
<em>changed</em> it, Feyerabend argued further that the <em>form</em>
of our knowledge can be altered to fit our ideals. So we can
<em>have</em> certainty and theories that merely summarize experience
if we wish. However, he urged that we should opt instead for theories
that go beyond experience and try to say something informative about
reality itself because this is how science makes progress (by
competing as the best realistic interpretation of experience). In this
respect, he was following Popper&rsquo;s lead, reconstruing empiricism
as a doctrine about the most desirable form for our theories, rather
than as a view about the sources of knowledge.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Problems of Empiricism&rdquo; (1965) is a long paper that draws
consequences of Feyerabend&lsquo;s methodological views for the nature
of scientific progress. He emphasizes that he has been trying to
&ldquo;eliminate whatever remainder of an empirical &lsquo;core&rsquo;
may still be contained in Popper&rsquo;s point of view&rdquo; (p.
153). He envisions scientific progress as an ever-expanding ocean of
alternatives (very much like Bohm), rejecting the standard view of
scientific progress as converging on, or better approximating, an
ideal point of view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Knowledge so conceived is not a process that converges toward an ideal
view; it is an ever increasing <em>ocean of alternatives,</em> each of
them forcing the others into greater articulation, ail of them
contributing, via this process of competition, to the development of
our mental faculties (1965, pp. 224&ndash;225; 1981, p. 107).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this perspective, the history of science becomes an inseparable
part of science itself.</p>

<h3 id="ImpaStudRevoMidLateSixt">4.3 The Impact of the &lsquo;Student Revolution&rsquo;: The Mid to Late Sixties</h3>

<p>
In Alpbach in 1964, Feyerabend and Feigl jointly directed a seminar on
the recent development of analytic philosophy. Feyerabend was still
very much attached to scientific philosophy, and considered philosophy
worthless unless it made a positive contribution to the growth of
knowledge (which, of course, meant science) as he continued his
crusades to disinfect contemporary empiricism and to chastise
linguistic philosophy for entrenching meanings by merely analyzing
them, instead of trying to improve them. The mid-to-late 1960s became
a time of ferment in Western culture, and Feyerabend was in the thick
of it. In Berkeley, naturally, he ran into the Free Speech Movement,
and he encountered the &ldquo;student revolution&rdquo; there too, as
well as in London and Berlin. This fired his interest in political
philosophy, more especially in political questions about science. Of
his post at Berkeley, he later said:</p>

<blockquote>
My function was to carry out the educational policies of the State of
California which means I had to teach people what a small group of
white intellectuals had decided was knowledge (1978, p. 118).
</blockquote>

<p>
However, Feyerabend&rsquo;s experience under these educational
policies was undoubtedly one of the defining periods of his
intellectual life, a time in which he became deeply suspicious of
these intellectuals and &ldquo;Western rationalism&rdquo; as a
whole:</p>

<blockquote>
In the years 1964ff. Mexicans, Blacks, Indians entered the university
as a result of new educational policies. There they sat, partly
curious, partly disdainful, partly simply confused hoping to get an
&ldquo;education&rdquo;. What an opportunity for a prophet in search
of a following! What an opportunity, my rationalist friends told me,
to contribute to the spreading of reason and the improvement of
mankind! I felt very differently. For it dawned on me that the
intricate arguments and the wonderful stories I had so far told to my
more or less sophisticated audience might just be dreams, reflections
of the conceit of a small group who had succeeded in enslaving
everyone else with their ideas. Who was I to tell these people what
and how to think? (1978, p. 118. See also 1995, p. 123).
</blockquote>

<p>
At this time, Feyerabend gave two lecture series, one on general
philosophy, and one on philosophy of science. He seems to have got
into some trouble at Berkeley by running his seminar on unacceptably
loose lines, regularly canceling lectures, and failing to prepare for
the lectures he did give:</p>

<blockquote>
I often told the students to go home&mdash;the official notes would
contain everything they needed. As a result an audience of 300, 500,
even 1,200 shrank to 50 or 30. I wasn&rsquo;t happy about that; I
would have preferred a larger audience, and yet I repeated my advice
until the administration intervened. Why did I do it? Was it because I
disliked the examination system, which blurred the line between
thought and routine? Was it because I despised the idea that knowledge
was a skill that had to be acquired and stabilized by rigorous
training? Or was it because I didn&rsquo;t think much of my own
performance? All these factors may have played a role (p. 122).
</blockquote>

<p>
But although he sympathized with the original aims of the student
movement, Feyerabend was unimpressed by their leaders, feeling that
their ideas were as authoritarian as those they were trying to
replace. He reports having cut fewer lectures during the student
strike than either before or afterward! Nevertheless, by holding his
lectures off-campus during this campus war, Feyerabend antagonized the
administration that had hired him. Reports of him giving
&ldquo;A&rdquo; grades to every student in his class, regardless of
their production (or lack of it), abound. He had the impression that
some of his colleagues, especially John Searle, wanted to have him
fired and that they only gave up when they realized how much paperwork
would be involved (p. 126).</p>

<p>
In Hamburg in 1965, a discussion on the foundations of quantum theory
with the physicist C.F. von Weizs&auml;cker belatedly set doubts in
Feyerabend&rsquo;s mind about the value of his normative approach to
general methodology:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Von Weizs&auml;cker showed how quantum mechanics arose from concrete
research while I complained, on general methodological grounds, that
important alternatives had been omitted. The arguments supporting my
complaint were quite good&hellip; but it was suddenly clear to me that
imposed without regard to circumstances they were a hindrance rather
than a help: a person trying to solve a problem whether in science or
elsewhere <em>must be given complete freedom</em> and cannot be
restricted by any demands, norms, however plausible they may seem to
the logician or the philosopher who has thought them out in the
privacy of his study. Norms and demands must be checked by research,
not by appeal to theories of rationality. In a lengthy article, I
explained how Bohr had used this philosophy and how it differs from
more abstract procedures. Thus Professor von Weizs&auml;cker has prime
responsibility for my change to &ldquo;anarchism&rdquo;&mdash;though
he was not at all pleased when I told him so in 1977 (1978, p.
117).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
During the summer of 1966, Feyerabend lectured on church dogma at
Berkeley: &ldquo;Why church dogma? Because the development of church
dogma shares many features with the development of scientific
thought&rdquo; (pp. 137&ndash;138). He eventually turned these
thoughts into a paper on &ldquo;Classical Empiricism&rdquo;, published
in 1970, in which he argued that empiricism shared certain problematic
features with Protestantism.</p>

<p>
In London, lecturing at University College and the LSE, he met Imre
Lakatos. The two became great friends, corresponding with one another
regularly and voluminously until Lakatos&rsquo; death. Feyerabend
recalls that Lakatos, whose office was across the corridor from the
LSE lecture hall, used to intervene in his lectures when Feyerabend
made a point he disagreed with (p. 128, 1978, p. 13). For his part,
listening from the hallway to Lakatos lecture his students on
Popper&rsquo;s methodology in mid-December 1967, Feyerabend had an
epiphany and &lsquo;awoke&rsquo; from his &lsquo;dogmatic
slumber&rsquo; &ndash; he no longer considered himself to be a
Popperian. He flew home and immediately announced his break from
Popper&rsquo;s school in two dramatic letters sent on the 17 of
December, one to Lakatos and one to John Watkins that explain how his
1962 criticism of Popper&rsquo;s empiricism had led to his new
&lsquo;position&rsquo; (in &lsquo;scare quotes&rsquo; because his
position is that he has no position). He immediately generalized from
the limited validity of falsificationism to &ldquo;anything
goes&rdquo; (the limited validity of all methodological rules) and he
announced his plan to use the title &ldquo;Against Method&rdquo;,
citing Susan Sontag&rsquo;s <em>Against Interpretation</em> (1966). In
this reversal on realism, together with his attempt to contribute to a
positive model for the acquisition of knowledge, Feyerabend abandoned
his recommendation that common knowledge should be corrected according
to science. Instead, he began to argue that common knowledge should be
protected from science. Decisions about ontological issues such as
realism should be guided by the pursuit of happiness, not in support
of some tyrannical truth.</p>

<p>
Despite taking his academic duties and responsibilities decreasingly
seriously, and coming into conflict with his own university&rsquo;s
administration as a result, Feyerabend had not yet fouled his
substantial reputation as a serious philosopher of science. He reports
that he received job offers from London, Berlin, Yale, and Auckland,
that he was invited to become a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford,
and that he corresponded with Friedrich von Hayek (whom he already
knew from the Alpbach seminars) about a job in Freiburg (p. 127). He
accepted the posts in London, Berlin, and Yale. In 1968, he resigned
from UC Berkeley and left for Minneapolis, but grew homesick, got
re-appointed, and returned to Berkeley almost immediately.</p>

<h2 id="FeyeLateWorkTowaRelaButThenBeyoIt">5. Feyerabend&rsquo;s Later Work: Towards Relativism, but then Beyond It</h2>

<h3 id="AgaiMeth1970">5.1 <em>Against Method</em> (1970&ndash;1975)</h3>

<p>
After stints in London, Berlin, and Yale (all of them running
alongside his post at UC Berkeley), Feyerabend took up a visiting
professorship at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and lectured
there in 1972 and 1974 (pp. 134&ndash;5). He even considered settling
down in New Zealand around that time (p. 153), although this hardly
seems compatible with his jet-setting lifestyle.</p>

<p>
In 1970, he published a long article entitled &ldquo;Against Method:
Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge&rdquo; in which he
attacked several prominent accounts of scientific methodology.
Originally, it was planned as a debate to be entitled <em>For and
Against Method</em>, in which Lakatos would put forward the
&ldquo;rationalist&rdquo; case that there was an identifiable set of
rules of scientific method that make all good science, good science,
and Feyerabend would attack it. Lakatos&rsquo; unexpected death in
February 1974, which seems to have shocked Feyerabend deeply, put an
end to his hope that Lakatos, who had backed out, would reconsider and
contribute to the project.</p>

<p>
Later that year, Feyerabend found himself lecturing at the University
of Sussex:</p>

<blockquote>
I have no idea why and how I went to the University of Sussex at
Brighton [&hellip;] what I do remember is that I taught two terms
(1974/1975) and then resigned; twelve hours a week (one lecture
course, the rest tutorials) was too much (p. 153).
</blockquote>

<p>
A member of Feyerabend&rsquo;s audience recalls things in rather more
detail:</p>

<blockquote>
Sussex University: the start of the Autumn Term, 1974. There was not a
seat to be had in the biggest Arts lecture theatre on campus. Taut
with anticipation, we waited expectantly and impatiently for the
advertized event to begin. He was not on time&mdash;as usual. In fact
rumour had it that he would not be appearing at all that illness (or
was it just ennui? or perhaps a mistress?) had confined him to bed.
But just as we began sadly to reconcile ourselves to the idea that
there would be no performance that day at all, Paul Feyerabend burst
through the door at the front of the packed hall. Rather pale, and
supporting himself on a short metal crutch, he walked with a limp
across to the blackboard. Removing his sweater he picked up the chalk
and wrote down three questions one beneath the other: What&rsquo;s so
great about knowledge? What&rsquo;s so great about science?
What&rsquo;s so great about truth? We were not going to be
disappointed after all!

<p>
During the following weeks of that term, and for the rest of his year
as a visiting lecturer, Feyerabend demolished virtually every
traditional academic boundary. He held no idea and no person sacred.
With unprecedented energy and enthusiasm he discussed anything from
Aristotle to the Azande. How does science differ from witchcraft? Does
it provide the only rational way of cognitively organizing our
experience? What should we do if the pursuit of truth cripples our
intellects and stunts our individuality? Suddenly epistemology became
an exhilarating area of investigation.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend created spaces in which people could breathe again. He
demanded of philosophers that they be receptive to ideas from the most
disparate and apparently far-flung domains, and insisted that only in
this way could they understand the processes whereby knowledge grows.
His listeners were enthralled, and he held his huge audiences until,
too ill and too exhausted to continue, he simply began repeating
himself. But not before he had brought the house down by writing
&ldquo;Aristotle&rdquo; in three-foot high letters on the blackboard
and then writing &ldquo;Popper&rdquo; in tiny, virtually illegible
letters beneath it! (Krige 1980, pp. 106&ndash;107).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given his poor health, Feyerabend tried many unorthodox
approaches.&nbsp;He&nbsp;started seeing a healer who had been
recommended to him. The treatment was successful, and thenceforth
Feyerabend referred to his own case as an example of both the failures
of orthodox medicine and the largely unexplored possibilities of
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; or traditional remedies.</p>

<p>
Instead of a joint book with Lakatos, Feyerabend put together his
<em>tour de force</em>, the book version of <em>Against Method</em>
(1975), which he sometimes conceived of as a letter to Lakatos (to
whom the book is dedicated). A more accurate description, however, is
the one given in his autobiography:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>AM</em> is not a book, it is a collage. It contains descriptions,
analyses, arguments that I had published, in almost the same words,
ten, fifteen, even twenty years earlier [&hellip;] I arranged them in
a suitable order, added transitions, replaced moderate passages with
more outrageous ones, and called the result &ldquo;anarchism&rdquo;. I
loved to shock people (pp. 139, 142).
</blockquote>

<p>
The book contained many of the ideas and arguments developed in his
earlier works, augmented with a case study on the transition from
geocentric to heliocentric astronomy. But whereas he had previously
been trying to contribute to a positive model for the acquisition of
knowledge (a pluralistic methodology), he now argued against all
general methodological rules, having concluded that they all have only
limited validity. General methodological principles do not guide
actual research. Actual research determines the scientific method and
whatever works, works &ndash; sometimes citing Einstein&rsquo;s claim
that a scientist &ldquo;must appear to the systematic epistemologist
as a type of unscrupulous opportunist&rdquo; (Feyerabend 1975, p.
11).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend emphasized that older scientific theories, like
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of motion, had powerful empirical and
argumentative support, and stressed, correlatively, that the heroes of
the scientific revolution, such as Galileo, were not as scrupulous as
they were sometimes represented to be. He portrayed Galileo as making
full use of rhetoric, propaganda, and various epistemological tricks
to support the heliocentric position. Feyerabend also sought further
to downgrade the importance of empirical arguments by suggesting that
aesthetic criteria, personal whims, and social factors have a far more
decisive role in the history of science than rationalist or empiricist
historiography would indicate.</p>

<p>
<em>Against Method</em> explicitly drew the &ldquo;epistemological
anarchist&rdquo; conclusion that there are no useful and exceptionless
methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth
of knowledge. The history of science is so complex that if we insist
on a general methodology that will not inhibit progress the only
&ldquo;rule&rdquo; it will contain will be the useless suggestion:
&ldquo;Anything goes&rdquo;. In particular, logical empiricism and
Popper&rsquo;s critical rationalism would inhibit scientific progress
by imposing overly restrictive conditions on the legitimacy of new
theories. The more sophisticated &ldquo;methodology of scientific
research programmes&rdquo; developed by Lakatos either contains
ungrounded value judgments about what constitutes good science, or it
is reasonable only because it is epistemological anarchism in
disguise. The phenomenon of methodological incommensurability renders
the standards that these &ldquo;rationalists&rdquo; use for comparing
theories inapplicable. The book thus (understandably) had Feyerabend
branded an &ldquo;irrationalist&rdquo;. At a time when Kuhn was
downplaying the perceived &ldquo;irrationalist&rdquo; implications of
his work, Feyerabend was perceived to be casting himself in the role
others already saw as his for the taking. He rejected
<em>political</em> anarchism. His political philosophy was a mixture
of liberalism and social democracy.</p>

<p>
He later said:</p>

<blockquote>
One of my motives for writing <em>Against Method</em> was to free
people from the tyranny of philosophical obfuscators and abstract
concepts such as &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, &ldquo;reality&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;objectivity&rdquo;, which narrow people&rsquo;s vision and ways
of being in the world. Formulating what I thought were my own attitude
and convictions, I unfortunately ended up by introducing concepts of
similar rigidity, such as &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;,
&ldquo;tradition&rdquo;, or &ldquo;relative truth&rdquo;. Now that I
am aware of it, I wonder how it happened. The urge to explain
one&rsquo;s own ideas, not simply, not in a story, but by means of a
&ldquo;systematic account&rdquo;, is powerful indeed (pp.
179&ndash;180).
</blockquote>

<h3 id="PoliConsEpisAnarScieFreeSoci1978">5.2 The Political Consequences of Epistemological Anarchism: <em>Science in a Free Society</em> (1978)</h3>

<p>
The critical reaction to <em>Against Method</em> seems to have taken
Feyerabend by surprise. He was shocked to be accused of being
aggressive and nasty, so he replied by accusing his accusers of the
very same thing. He felt it necessary to respond to most of the
book&rsquo;s major reviews in print, and later assembled these replies
into a section of his next book, <em>Science in a Free Society</em>
(1978), entitled &ldquo;Conversations with Illiterates&rdquo;. Here he
berated unfortunate reviewers for having misread <em>Against
Method</em>, as well as for being constitutionally incapable of
distinguishing between irony, playfulness, argument by <em>reductio ad
absurdum</em>, and the (apparently rather few) things he had really
committed himself to in <em>AM</em>. The spectacle of Feyerabend
leveling these accusations at others is not itself without irony. (His
widow reports that he did not want the book re-issued). In the
commotion surrounding <em>AM</em>, Feyerabend succumbed to
depression:</p>

<blockquote>
now I was alone, sick with some unknown affliction; my private life
was in a mess, and I was without a defense. I often wished I had never
written that fucking book (p. 147).
</blockquote>

<p>
Feyerabend saw himself as having undermined the arguments for
science&rsquo;s privileged position within culture, and much of his
later work was a critique of the position of science within Western
societies. The <em>results</em> of science don&rsquo;t prove its
excellence, since these results have often depended on the presence of
non-scientific elements. Science only prevails over other forms of
knowledge because &ldquo;the show has been rigged in its favour&rdquo;
(1978, p. 102), and other traditions, despite their achievements, have
never been given a chance. The truth, he suggests, is that:</p>

<blockquote>
science is much closer to myth than a scientific philosophy is
prepared to admit. It is one of the many forms of thought that have
been developed by man, and not necessarily the best. It is
conspicuous, noisy, and impudent, but it is inherently superior only
for those who have already decided in favour of a certain ideology, or
who have accepted it without ever having examined its advantages and
its limits (1975, p. 295).
</blockquote>

<p>
The separation of church and state should therefore be supplemented by
the separation of science and state, for us to achieve the humanity we
are capable of. Setting up the ideal of a free society as &ldquo;a
society in which all traditions have equal rights and equal access to
the centers of power&rdquo; (1978, p. 9), Feyerabend argues that
science is a threat to democracy. To defend society against science we
should place science under democratic control and be intensely
skeptical about scientific &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, consulting them only
if they are controlled democratically by juries of laypeople (on
Feyerabend&rsquo;s political philosophy, see Kidd 2016b).</p>

<h3 id="TenWondYearEighBerkZuri">5.3 Ten Wonderful Years: The Eighties in Berkeley and Zurich</h3>

<p>
Out of all Feyerabend&rsquo;s many academic positions, perhaps the one
he enjoyed most was his tenure throughout the 1980s at the
<em>Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule</em>, Zurich. Feyerabend
applied for the post after his friend Eric Jantsch had told him that
the Polytechnic was looking for a philosopher of science. The
selection process was, by Feyerabend&rsquo;s account, very long and
somewhat involved (pp. 154ff.). Having recently left another post in
Kassel, he appears to have given up hopes of being hired by the Swiss,
and so &ldquo;decided to remain in Berkeley and stop moving
about&rdquo; (p. 158). But, after several stages in the
decision-making procedure, he was finally given the job, and
&ldquo;ten wonderful years of half-Berkeley, half-Switzerland&rdquo;
(p. 158) turned out to be exactly what he had been looking for. At
Zurich, he lectured on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Theaetetus</em> and
<em>Timaeus</em>, and then on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em>. The
two-hour seminars, many of which were organized by Christian Thomas
(with whom Feyerabend was to edit anthologies) were run on the same
lines as Berkeley: no set topic, but presentations by the participants
(p. 160). Feyerabend later considered this to be the period in which
he &ldquo;got his intellectual act together&rdquo; (p. 162), meaning
that he recovered from the critical reactions to <em>Against
Method</em>. However, this didn&rsquo;t seem to have affected his
attitude towards his institutional responsibilities: in Zurich, he
refused offers of an office, because no office meant no office hours,
and therefore no waste of time (pp. 131, 158).</p>

<p>
Many of the more important papers Feyerabend published during the
mid-1980s were collected together in <em>Farewell to Reason</em>
(1987). The major message of this book is that recognizing some forms
of relativism is part of the solution to the problems generated by
conflicting beliefs and ways of life (for the various components of
Feyerabend&rsquo;s relativism, see Kusch 2016). Feyerabend suggests
that the contemporary intellectual scene in Western culture is by no
means as fragmented and cacophonous as many intellectuals would have
us believe. The surface diversity belies a deeper uniformity, a
monotony generated and sustained by the cultural and ideological
imperialism that the West uses to beat its opponents into submission.
Such uniformity, however, can be shown to be harmful even when judged
by the standards of those who impose it. Cultural diversity, which
already exists in some societies, is a good thing, not least because
it affords the best defense against totalitarian domination.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend proposed supporting the idea of cultural diversity both
positively, by producing considerations in its favor, and negatively
&ldquo;by criticizing philosophies that oppose it&rdquo; (1987, p. 5).
Contemporary philosophies of the latter type are said to rest on the
notions of <em>Objectivity</em> and <em>Reason</em>. He seeks to
undermine the former notion by pointing out that confrontations
between cultures with strongly held opinions about what is objectively
true can go in different directions. The result of such confrontation
may be the persistence of the old views, fruitful and mutual
interaction, relativism, or argumentative evaluation.
&ldquo;Relativism&rdquo; here means the decision to treat other
people&rsquo;s form of life, and the beliefs it embodies, as
&ldquo;true-for-them&rdquo;, while treating our own views as
&ldquo;true-for-us&rdquo;. Feyerabend feels that this is an
appropriate way to <em>resolve</em> such a confrontation.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend complains that the ideas of reason and rationality are
&ldquo;ambiguous and never clearly explained&rdquo; (1987, p. 10);
they are deified hangovers from autocratic times that no longer have
any content, but whose &ldquo;halo of excellence&rdquo; (ibid.) clings
to them and lends them spurious respectability:</p>

<blockquote>
[R]ationalism has no identifiable content and reason no recognizable
agenda over and above the principles of the party that happens to have
appropriated its name. All it does now is to lend class to the general
drive towards monotony. It is time to disengage Reason from this drive
and, as it has been thoroughly compromised by the association, to bid
it farewell (1987, p. 13).
</blockquote>

<p>
Relativism is the tool with which Feyerabend hopes to &ldquo;undermine
the very basis of Reason&rdquo; (ibid.). But is it Reason with a
capital &ldquo;R&rdquo;, the philosophers&rsquo; abstraction alone,
that is to be renounced, or reason itself too? Feyerabend is on weak
ground when he claims that &ldquo;Reason&rdquo; is a
philosopher&rsquo;s notion that has no content, for it is precisely
the philosopher who <em>is</em> willing to attach a specific content
to the formal notion of rationality (unlike the layperson, whose
notion of reason is closer to what Feyerabend calls the
&ldquo;material&rdquo; conception, where to be rational is &ldquo;to
avoid certain views and to accept others&rdquo; (1987, p. 10).</p>

<p>
Relativism is a result of cultural confrontation, an &ldquo;attempt to
make sense of the phenomenon of cultural variety&rdquo; (1987, p. 19).
Feyerabend is well aware that the term &ldquo;relativism&rdquo; itself
is understood in many different ways. At some points, he merely
endorses views that no one would deny, but which do not deserve to be
called relativist (such as the idea that people may profit from
studying other points of view, no matter how strongly they hold their
own view (1987, p. 20). At others, he does manage to subscribe to a
genuinely relativist view but fails to show why it must be accepted
(for a detailed analysis of Feyerabend&rsquo;s forms of relativism,
see Kusch 2016).</p>

<p>
It was only in 1988, on the 50th anniversary of Austria&rsquo;s
unification with Germany, that Feyerabend became interested in his
past (p. 1). The Feyerabends left California for life in Switzerland
and Italy in the fall of 1989 (p. 2). It was during this move that
Feyerabend re-discovered his mother&rsquo;s suicide note (p. 9), which
may have been one of the factors that spurred him to write his
autobiography (the Waldheim affair was another). Feyerabend looked
forward to his retirement, and he and Grazia decided to try to have
children. He claimed to have forgotten the thirty-five years of his
academic career almost as quickly as he had earlier forgotten his
military service (p. 168).</p>

<h3 id="FeyeNinePoteEverCultAllCult">5.4 Feyerabend in the Nineties: &ldquo;Potentially Every Culture is All Cultures&rdquo; (1994)</h3>

<p>
In the early 1990s, Feyerabend truncated his Berkeley lecture into a
series of five lectures entitled &lsquo;What is knowledge? What is
science?&rsquo;. These were originally delivered to a general
audience, but Feyerabend edited the lectures into a monograph, which
was published as <em>The Tyranny of Science</em> (2011). The main
themes of the book are as follows. Scientists and philosophers
sometimes present science as a unified worldview, a monolith (or a
monster, depending on one&rsquo;s preferences). It is not. Science is
both incomplete and quite strongly disunified. It does not speak with
a single voice, therefore appeals to the abstraction
&lsquo;Science&rsquo; are out of place. The ideology known as
objectivism, or scientific materialism, which takes science to be our
ultimate measure of what exists, is therefore ungrounded. Its
defenders, who portray themselves as the defenders of Reason, are
often the kind of intellectual imperialists whose attitudes and advice
in the past led, or would have led, to the destruction of first-nation
communities.</p>

<p>
Other equally popular philosophical claims about science are also
flawed. The idea that science is successful needs interrogation.
Science does have some successes, but these can be detached from the
ideology that seems to support them. The idea that science starts from
facts, and eschews theories until the facts are gathered, is a myth.
The same can be said of the idea that science is value-free, and also
of the idea that scientific results are relevant to our most urgent
social problems.</p>

<p>
One aspect of the disunity of science is that &lsquo;scientists&rsquo;
should not mean merely theoreticians: science also (and essentially)
features experimentalists. In their work, the importance of hands-on
experience, and of what Michael Polanyi called &lsquo;tacit
knowledge&rsquo;, is most obvious. But in fact, these sorts of
experiences and knowledge play an important role throughout the
sciences, even in their most obviously theoretical parts. The
Platonic-rationalist picture of science as pure thinking about the
nature of reality is a distortion.</p>

<p>
One of Feyerabend&rsquo;s central complaints is that a particular
abstract, theoretical, &lsquo;objectivist&rsquo; kind of science,
together with an associated kind of thinking about science, now
dominates our thinking, and thereby excludes more human modes of
thought. Scientism, the belief that science has the answer to all
meaningful questions, is also a main target (on Feyerabend and
scientism, see Kidd 2021). Feyerabend&rsquo;s typical strategy is to
take some hallowed idea (e.g., that the success of science is due to
observation and experiment), and ask: how did it arise? Tracing its
ancestry back to ancient Greek thinkers (usually Plato, Parmenides, or
Xenophanes), he assesses their arguments for it and finds them
eminently resistible. His complaint is not that their arguments are
invalid, though&mdash;that would be already to take on a
quasi-scientific mode of assessment. Instead, Feyerabend makes it
clear that he prefers &lsquo;stories&rsquo; (or even
&lsquo;fairytales&rsquo;) to arguments, and that rival stories are to
be assessed in terms of how interesting, appealing, or revealing they
are. The sorts of stories the ancient Greek tragedians told, being
more obviously human, fare better on such measures than those of the
ancient Greek philosophers, so we should not assume that philosophers
are our best guides in such matters.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend continued his investigation of &ldquo;The Rise of Western
Rationalism&rdquo;. He tried to show that Reason (with a capital
&ldquo;R&rdquo;) and Science had displaced the binding principles of
previous worldviews <em>not</em> as the result of having won an
argument, but as the result of power-play. While the first
philosophers (the pre-Socratic thinkers) had interesting views, their
attempt to replace, streamline, or rationalize the folk wisdom that
surrounded them was eminently resistible. Their introduction of the
appearance/reality dichotomy made nonsense of many of the things
people had previously known. Even nowadays, indigenous cultures and
counter-cultural practices provide alternatives to Reason and an
imperialistic Western science.</p>

<p>
In most of his work after <em>Against Method</em>, Feyerabend
emphasized the &ldquo;disunity of science&rdquo;. Science, he insists,
is a collage, not a system or a unified project. Not only does it
include plenty of components derived from distinctly
&ldquo;non-scientific&rdquo; disciplines, but these components are
often vital parts of the &ldquo;progress&rdquo; science has made
(using whatever criterion of progress you prefer). Science is a
collection of theories, practices, research traditions, and worldviews
whose range of applications is not well-determined and whose merits
vary to a great extent. All this can be summed up in his slogan:
&ldquo;Science is not one thing, it is many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Likewise, in <em>Conquest of Abundance</em>, the supposed ontological
correlate of science, &ldquo;the world&rdquo;, consists not only of
one kind of thing but of countless kinds of things, things which
cannot be &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; to one another. There is no good
reason to suppose that the world has a single, determinate nature.
Rather we inquirers construct the world in the course of our
inquiries, and the plurality of our inquiries ensures that the world
itself has a deeply plural quality: the Homeric gods and the
microphysicist&rsquo;s subatomic particles are simply different ways
in which &ldquo;Being&rdquo; responds to (different kinds of) inquiry.
How the world is &ldquo;in-itself&rdquo; is forever unknowable. In
this respect, Feyerabend&rsquo;s work can be thought of as aligned
with social constructivism.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend also published a surprisingly large number of little
reviews and papers in the 1990s (although many of them are very short,
with overlapping content). Several appeared in a new journal,
<em>Common Knowledge</em>, in whose inauguration he had a hand, and
which set out to integrate insights from all parts of the intellectual
landscape. Although these papers were on scattered subjects, there are
some strong themes running through them, several of which bear
comparison with what gets called &ldquo;post-modernism&rdquo; (see
Preston 1998). Often, they have provocative titles, such as
&ldquo;Atoms and Consciousness&rdquo; (1992a), &ldquo;Nature as a Work
of Art: A Fictitious Lecture Delivered to a Conference Trying to
Establish the Increasing Importance of Aesthetics for Our Age&rdquo;
(1992b), and &ldquo;Potentially Every Culture is All Cultures&rdquo;
(1994). They take &ldquo;Ethics as a Measure of Scientific
Truth&rdquo; (1992c).</p>

<h2 id="ConcLastThin">6. Conclusion: Last Things</h2>

<p>
A remarkable feature of Feyerabend&rsquo;s philosophical development
is how directly connected it was to the tumultuous times through which
he lived &ndash; from logical positivism to post-modernism. He was
occupied with his autobiography right up until his death on February
11th, 1994, at the Genolier Clinic, overlooking Lake Geneva. At the
end of the book, he expressed the wish that what should remain of him
would be &ldquo;<em>not</em> papers, <em>not</em> final declarations,
but love&rdquo; (p. 181). A third volume of his <em>Philosophical
Papers</em> appeared in 1999, as did <em>The Conquest of
Abundance,</em> the final unfinished book he had also been working on.
In 2009, his long-lost, <em>Naturphilosphie</em> was published (in
English <em>The Philosophy of Nature</em>, 2016), which was written in
the early to mid-1970s as a companion to <em>Against Method</em>,
followed by his 1992 Trentino lecture series that he had edited into
book form as <em>The Tyranny of Science</em> in 2011. A fourth volume
of his <em>Collected Papers</em>, <em>Philosophy and Physics</em> was
published in 2016. The first volume of his collected correspondence,
<em>Feyerabend&rsquo;s Formative Years</em> (<em>Feyerabend and
Popper. Correspondence and Unpublished Papers</em>), was published in
2020. The second volume (<em>Feyerabend on Logical Empiricism, Bohm
and Kuhn</em>) was published in 2024.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend came to be seen as a leading cultural relativist, not just
because he stressed that some theories and worldviews are
incommensurable, but also because he defended a form of relativism in
politics as well as in epistemology. From the mid-1970s to the first
half of the 1990s, his denunciations of Western imperialism, his
critique of scientism, his defense of the pursuit of alternative
medicine, astrology, and voodoo, and his emphasis on environmental
issues made him a hero of anti-technological countercultures.</p>

<p>
Different components and phases of Feyerabend&rsquo;s work have
influenced very different groups of thinkers. His early scientific
realism, contextual theory of meaning, and the way he proposed to
defend materialism were taken up by Paul and Patricia Churchland.
Richard Rorty, for a time, also endorsed eliminative materialism.
Feyerabend&rsquo;s critique of reductionism has influenced
philosophers of science such as Cliff Hooker, Bas van Fraassen, and
John Dupr&eacute;, and his general point of view has been popularized
by Alan Chalmers&rsquo; well-known introduction to philosophy of
science <em>What Is This Thing Called Science?</em> (1978). Feyerabend
has also had considerable influence within sociology, where many of
what were once taken to be controversial views have become
commonplace. While he has directly inspired books like D.L.
Phillips&rsquo;s <em>Abandoning Method</em> (1973), which attempts to
transcend methodology, less directly, he has exerted enormous
influence on a generation of sociologists of science through his
relativism, social constructivism, and apparent irrationalism,
according to which social history is a series of accidents, not
something governed by laws or even teleological (directed at some
pre-established goal). It is still far too early to say whether, and
in what way, his philosophy will be remembered.</p>
