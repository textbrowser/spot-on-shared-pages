&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t was a first-rate philosopher, Sufi
master, theologian, legal judge, poet, and scriptural exegete. He was
a highly innovative author who wrote in both Arabic and Persian, and
whose ideas in so many domains, from cosmology and metaphysics to
epistemology and theory of love, left an indelible mark upon later
Islamic thought. His writings in Persian had a lasting influence upon
various Sufi figures and orders in Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and
particularly India, while his Arabic writings were studied in
intellectual circles throughout the Muslim east into the early modern
period, and were even influential during the time of the British
Raj.</p>

<h2 id="LifWriExe">1. Life, Writings, Execution</h2>

<p>
Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Ma&#703;&#257;l&#299; Mu&#7717;ammad b. Ab&#299; Bakr
al-Hamad&#257;n&#299; was born in the Iranian city of Hamadan in 1097.
He received his early legal and theological training in the
Sh&#257;fi&#703;&#299; and Ash&#703;ar&#299; traditions respectively
and excelled in a variety of other subjects, including philosophy,
logic, Arabic and Persian poetry, Sufism, and mathematics, studying
the latter with the famous poet, mathematician, and philosopher
&#703;Umar Khayy&#257;m (d. ca. 1124). He became a legal judge likely
before the age of twenty, earning the title &ldquo;&#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rdquo; or &ldquo;the most eminent judge&rdquo;.
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t was already a well-known author by this
point, having written several no longer extant treatises in rational
theology and mathematics, and a still extant one-thousand-line Arabic
love poem (Rustom 2023a: 1&ndash;4).</p>

<p>
By his own recounting, in 1112 &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
experienced a crisis of certainty not unsimilar to that of Ab&#363;
&#7716;&#257;mid al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, who had died the year before.
After immersion in Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s writings for a period of
four years, our philosopher regained his spiritual bearings and
dedicated himself more entirely to the inner life. In 1119 he came
into contact with Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s younger brother,
A&#7717;mad Ghaz&#257;l&#299; (d. 1126), who was one of the most
prominent Sufi teachers in Persia at that time (for whom, see Lumbard
2016). &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t excelled on the Sufi path (see
entry on
 <a href="../arabic-islamic-mysticism/">mysticism in Arabic and Islamic philosophy</a>)
 and was appointed by his own master as a spiritual guide
(<em>murshid</em>; Persian, <em>p&#299;r</em>) at the time of his
death.</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t authored about sixteen works in Arabic
and Persian, seven of which have survived. One of his Arabic books is
<em>Shakw&#257;&rsquo;l-ghar&#299;b</em> (<em>The Exile&rsquo;s
Complaint</em>), a short apology written in 1129 (in prison) against
the charges of heresy leveled against him (see below). His other book
in Arabic, which was extremely influential upon the later Islamic
intellectual tradition, is entitled <em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em> (<em>The Essence of Reality</em>). He
remarkably wrote this dense 100-page work of philosophical Sufism in a
matter of three days at the age of twenty-four. Among other things,
<em>Essence of Reality</em> represents the first full-out
philosophical defense of mysticism in the Islamic intellectual
tradition, developing the work of Avicenna (d. 1037) and
Ghaz&#257;l&#299; and in many ways anticipating the perspective of
later philosophical Sufism associated with the name of Ibn
&#703;Arab&#299; (d. 1240) and his school (for which, see Ali
2022).</p>

<p>
Thankfully, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s two most important
Persian works are in our possession. By far the most famous of these
is his masterpiece completed in 1127, the <em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>
(<em>Paving the Path</em>) (substantial selected translations in
Rustom 2023a). Written in a highly poetic and stylized form of Persian
that is at once mesmerizing and mysterious, the book contains most of
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s mature philosophical,
theological, legal, and mystical positions, and is fundamentally
concerned with the themes of non-duality and self-knowledge (Ariankhoo
&amp; Rustom 2023).</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s other book in Persian, completed
just before his death, is generically known as
<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em> (<em>The Letters</em>) (substantial
selected translations in Rustom 2023a). The work amounts to a
collection in three volumes of letters he wrote to his students,
disciples, and various friends who worked for the Seljuq government.
The letters contain a wealth of information regarding not only
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s main ideas, but also reveal
their author to have been a caring spiritual guide and teacher to
various kinds of individuals, from advanced Sufis to novices still
learning the basics of Islamic law and theology. <em>The Letters</em>
also demonstrate the degree to which &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t was
an acute critic of the Seljuq government&rsquo;s corrupt financial and
social practices, which were the key factors that led to his
state-sponsored execution.</p>

<p>
In 1128, a legal edict or <em>fatwa</em> was issued by state-funded
religious officials, recommending &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s execution on account of his
&ldquo;heretical&rdquo; theological views and alleged claims to
divinity. The only contemporaneous record we have of the details of
this accusation comes from &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s own
writings, particularly his <em>Exile&rsquo;s Complaint</em>. He shows
in this work how the charges brought against him were completely
sloppy and untenable, taking as they did &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
to task for some of his theological and philosophical positions
defended in <em>Essence of Reality</em> that were deeply indebted to
Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s rational theology&mdash;an irony, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t notes, because Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was sponsored and
championed by the same Seljuq state
(<em>Shakw&#257;&rsquo;l-ghar&#299;b</em>: 9&ndash;10). Incidentally,
the Seljuqs seem to not have cared about/been aware of &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s Persian writings, particularly <em>Paving
the Path</em>, which defends positions that could much more easily
have been deemed as &ldquo;heretical&rdquo; by those seeking to
discredit his orthodoxy.</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t explains that the Seljuqs were not at
all concerned with his beliefs and religious teachings. The real cause
for his imprisonment was the Seljuq&rsquo;s frantic need to silence
him on account of his vociferous and very public castigations of the
Seljuq state&rsquo;s corrupt financial practices and various other
forms of social injustice, including their abysmal lack of care for
the poor. As &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t notes, his case was not
looked upon sympathetically by the many religious scholars who
supported the <em>fatwa</em> against him because they were jealous of
him on account of his having completely outshined them in popularity
and in scholarship (Rustom 2023a: 4&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s death was personally overseen by
the Seljuq Vizier Qaww&#257;m al-D&#299;n Ab&#363;&rsquo;l-Q&#257;sim
Dargaz&#299;n&#299; (d. 1133), who viewed the execution as an
opportunity for his own professional advancement. At the same time, he
knew that &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s death would leave his
main enemy vulnerable&mdash;a Seljuq finance officer named
&#703;Az&#299;z al-D&#299;n (d. 1133), who was a disciple of &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t (see Safi 2006: chapter 6).</p>

<p>
Having spent a part of 1129 in a prison in Baghdad, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t was moved to another cell in his native Hamadan,
where he was publicly executed on the order of Sultan
Ma&#7717;m&#363;d b. Maliksh&#257;h (d. 1131) on May 6/7, 1131. At
some point in the twelfth/thirteenth century, a tomb was constructed
for &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t. The site was regularly visited by
Sufi pilgrims until its destruction during the reign of the Safavid
dynasty (1501&ndash;1736).</p>

<h2 id="KnoSouLimRea">2. Knowledge, Soul, Limits of Reason</h2>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s epistemology and psychology are
intimately connected, revolving around the concepts of
self-recognition, the inner self, the heart, and the limits of reason.
He begins by making a distinction between knowledge
(<em>&#703;ilm</em>) and recognition (<em>ma&#703;rifa</em>; Persian,
<em>ma&#703;rifat</em>) (for the latter, see Chittick &amp; Rustom
forthcoming). Whereas conventional knowledge pertains to discursive
duality and separates the knower from the objects of their knowledge,
recognition pertains to non-discursive unity, bridging the gap between
the knower and the objects of their knowledge.</p>

<p>
To understand the distinction between discursive duality and
non-discursive unity, consider Avicenna&rsquo;s discursive theory of
knowledge. It begins with the premise that all knowledge involves
either forming concepts (<em>ta&#7779;awwur</em>) through definitions,
following the Aristotelian method of identifying the genus
(<em>jins</em>) and specific difference (<em>fa&#7779;l</em>) of an
object, or affirming the truth (<em>ta&#7779;d&#299;q</em>) of a
statement through syllogisms. At a basic level, there is discursive
thinking (i.e., thinking that involves subjects and predicates), where
the intellect systematically builds syllogisms using both internal and
external senses such as sight, memory, and imagination, and grasps
intelligible concepts by identifying the middle terms. According to
Avicenna, the self, understood as the theoretical intellect, contains
several degrees, each of which represents a higher level in the
process of intellection that reaches its perfection in the acquired
intellect (<em>al-&#703;aql al-mustaf&#257;d</em>). The theoretical
intellect requires an external agency (i.e., the Active Intellect) to
actualize its ability to grasp universals. The Active Intellect acts
like the Sun that illuminates human intellectual faculties and makes
it possible for them to move from potentiality to actuality. (A great
deal of contention exists among Avicenna scholars regarding the
process of acquiring intelligible forms, with some strongly supporting
&ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; and others opting for
&ldquo;emanation&rdquo; (see Hasse 2014 and Black 2014). In contrast
to the abovementioned emanationist account, abstractionists argue that
meanings are abstracted from a non-conceptual transaction between our
senses and the world, leading to a version of the &ldquo;myth of the
given&rdquo;, i.e., empirical knowledge resulting from the
mind&rsquo;s innate ability (Azadpur 2020)).</p>

<p>
For all its merits, the Avicennan theory of knowledge and knowledge
acquisition would still be confined to <em>&#703;ilm</em> rather than
<em>ma&#703;rifa</em> from &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s
vantage point. As will be seen, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t does not
deny the validity of conceptual knowledge, but
&ldquo;recognition&rdquo; for him implies a higher mode of cognition
that one has to acquire through the &ldquo;eye of the heart&rdquo;
(<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;125). What is
&ldquo;recognized&rdquo; are the truths and realities of things as
buried deep down in one&rsquo;s own soul, and from this angle of
vision &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; (<em>ma&#703;rifa</em>) comes close
in meaning to Platonic recollection (<em>anamnesis</em>) (for which,
see Silverman 2003 [2022]).</p>

<p>
This closeness in meaning between recognition and recollection is
evidenced by the fact that &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;&#7789; agrees
with Plato insofar as the soul (i.e., the deepest and uncreated layer
of the soul) is the locus of previous acquaintance with the realities
of things (<em>&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>). The soul possesses
knowledge of the realities of things before the state of its
embodiment, and hence &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; involves the act of
rediscovering this forgotten knowledge. However, the precise nature of
this knowledge is left unexplained, apart from the fact that it
involves some sort of deep intuition about the self. This would be a
task left to the likes of Shih&#257;b al-D&#299;n al-Suhraward&#299;
(d. 1191) and the followers of Ibn &lsquo;Arab&#299;, such as
&#7778;adr al-D&#299;n al-Q&#363;naw&#299; (d. 1274), D&#257;w&#363;d
al-Qay&#7779;ar&#299; (d. 1350), and Shams al-D&#299;n
Fan&#257;r&#299; (d. 1430).</p>

<p>
The view of these successors of &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t becomes
clear when contrasted with Avicenna&rsquo;s rejection of Platonism and
his own theory of knowledge. For Plato, Forms are independent,
self-subsisting realities, which are the basis for his theory of
recollection. Avicenna rejects universals understood as Platonic Forms
for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that they are
vulnerable to the third man argument (see the discussion in the entry
on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/#ThiManArg132">Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em>, &sect;4.3)</a>).
 In place of Platonic Forms, he countenances the existence of <em>ante
rem</em> universals within the celestial Intellects, which are
instrumental for Avicenna in the reception of universals and, hence,
knowledge. However, he remains silent on a crucial point made by the
Sufi metaphysicians following in the wake of &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t. According to them, all genuine knowledge of
universal realities necessitates the universalization of the would-be
knower&rsquo;s mode of existence. That is, knowledge, ultimately, is a
mode of being (Cancelliere 2019: 125).</p>

<p>
While certainly not Plato&rsquo;s theory of the Forms and knowledge,
this account of knowledge does have its affinities. Knowledge for
those in the tradition of &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t is not the
reception of something distinct from the self as Avicenna would have
it&mdash;a mode of knowledge that is essentially dualistic in that the
receiver and what is received, namely, universal objects of knowledge
in the celestial intellect, are distinct; rather, in Platonic fashion,
the knower comes to recognize the objects of knowledge that have been
inherent and essentially are the very self of the knower, which had
hitherto been unrecognized.</p>

<p>
This brings us back to &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t for whom
recognition is a higher mode of knowing that fundamentally can only be
acquired through spiritual practice, thereby leading to the opening of
the eye of inner vision which transcends the limits of conventional
ways of knowing and leads to true self-knowledge (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;125). &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t cites the famous story of Moses and Khidr from the
Qur&rsquo;an (a staple theme in Sufi literature) to flesh out the
difference between knowledge and recognition. For instance, the Quran
(18:65&ndash;82) mentions the story of Moses meeting a stranger (often
identified as Khi&#7693;r, a possessor of special knowledge), who
baffles him by performing such actions as killing a boy and sinking a
boat. The Quran graphically describes Moses&rsquo; disgust at such
acts: &ldquo;You have certainly done a horrible thing!&rdquo; (Quran
18:74). Khi&#7693;r later reveals that he killed the boy because he
would grow up to be a disbeliever and would bring much hardship to his
parents, who were true believers. Moreover, he knew that God would
favor the parents with a more virtuous and caring child. As for the
boat, Khi&#7693;r informs Moses that there was a tyrant ahead of the
boat&rsquo;s owners, and that this tyrant was known to forcefully
seize undamaged boats. From this story, Sufis often deduce intuitive
knowledge that apparently contradicts our discursive thinking
involving common sense notions of morality and knowledge.</p>

<p>
While discussing the complexities of self-recognition, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t presents an intriguing view regarding the
body-soul relationship. On the one hand, he disagrees with Avicenna
and his followers who deny the soul&rsquo;s preexisting the body; on
the other hand, he maintains that no good argument has been offered to
support this position, noting that his certainty on the issue is based
on <em>ma&#703;rifa</em>. The human intellect can only understand the
existence of the soul by examining the body and its attributes, such
as the soul&rsquo;s ability to cause perception and movement, which
are common traits among all living beings. Our perception of the
soul&rsquo;s continued existence after its separation from the body is
based on analyzing intellectual perception, considering the soul as
the locus of knowledge. Since knowledge is indivisible, says &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, &ldquo;the division of its locus is
inconceivable&rdquo;, leading to the conclusion that the soul cannot
be destroyed (<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;150).
Here again, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s affinity with
Platonism becomes apparent. Based on the concept of
<em>anamnesis</em>, Plato too has Socrates conclude that there exists
a doctrine of pre-existence. Like &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, he
utilizes the idea of pre-existence to support arguments for the
soul&rsquo;s indestructability and immortality (particularly in
<em>Phaedo</em> 69e&ndash;84b).</p>

<p>
Moreover, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t argues against
Avicenna&rsquo;s position concerning the manner in which a
body&rsquo;s specific constitution acts as an accidental cause for a
particular soul&rsquo;s emergence into the sublunary realm. He argues
that the soul precedes the body, and that the states of a soul change
when it inhabits a body (<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>:
&sect;149&ndash;150). At a more subtle level, souls are characterized
by their limitless degrees of diversity (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;153). For some souls, there is
no intermediary between them and God (e.g., the souls of prophets). It
can be argued, for example, that the state of the soul changes
according to a host of various environmental factors; God, by
contrast, is above any kind of temporal change. &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t acknowledges such objections, but argues that
since God created people in His own image, it is possible for at least
some souls to reflect God&rsquo;s all-encompassing perfection or, to
put it another way, to reflect His image more directly. At the same
time, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t is quick to note that &ldquo;with
the exception of a few souls, there are many intermediaries between
their existence and the existence of the First&rdquo; (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;155). Regardless of the
relationship of the soul to God, every soul is implicated in a causal
chain that proceeds from the spiritual to the sensible realms.</p>

<p>
Being trained in the rational sciences, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
is aware that at its highest level, his treatment of the nature of the
heart and divine consciousness transcends the limits of discursive
thinking. From one perspective, the intellect or human reason
(<em>&#703;aql</em>) is an essential instrument by which truth can be
measured against falsehood and right can be discerned from wrong. From
another perspective, when an intelligent person embraces a purely
empirical attitude concerning immaterial entities, eschatological
matters, and the nature of God&rsquo;s radiating self-awareness, he
gropes at the impossible:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Reason is a valid scale, and its measurements are certain and real
with no unreality in it; and it is a just scale: it is inconceivable
that it can ever be unjust. Having said that, when an intelligent
person desires to weigh everything against reason, even the matters of
the next world, the reality of prophecy, and the realities of the
Beginningless divine attributes, that is a desire for the impossible.
(<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;187, with slight
modifications)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In making his case for the suprasensory nature of this higher mode of
knowing, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t borrows a phrase made popular
by Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, namely &ldquo;the stage beyond reason&rdquo;
(<em>al-&#7789;awr war&#257;&#702; al-&#703;aql</em>). In relation to
the reasoning faculty, the stage beyond reason (or what he also calls
&ldquo;stages beyond reason&rdquo;) is as the soul is to the body
(<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;185). This special
vantage point is itself accessed through inner purity and
expansiveness of the heart:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When your heart has expanded for faith in the unseen, God will cause a
light to pour into your inner self, the likes of which you have not
witnessed before. This is one of the traces of that stage that appears
after the stage of reason. So intensify your search, for that alone is
what you need in order to find! (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;176, with slight
modifications)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The stage beyond reason presents many difficulties to our ordinary,
discursive intelligence, much like the way primary concepts are
utterly unknowable to the bodily senses (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;178). Indeed, it is the senses
themselves that stand in the way of accessing this stage of knowing,
which can only be obtained by those who have arrived at true
recognition. To highlight the directness of the kind of knowing
conferred by the stage beyond reason, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
employs a common Sufi sensory image, again bequeathed by
Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, namely that of &ldquo;tasting&rdquo;
(<em>dhawq</em>). Tasting can convey to embodied people the
affect-like nature of recognition, but it too falls short, trapped as
it is in language (<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>:
&sect;122). In the final analysis, recognition for &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t leads to a state of perception
(<em>idr&#257;k</em>) in which the subject/object dichotomy dissolves
and the perceiver themselves &ldquo;become&rdquo; the objects of
perception and in fact the Perceived Itself
(<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:213&ndash;214; 3:397). Moreover, in
this world, the stage beyond reason can only be accessed by those who
have attained true self-recognition (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;&sect;184&ndash;185).
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
O chevalier! So long as a person is in sense perception, his
perception can only be a finite attribute. When he reaches
intellectual perception, the individual parts of his objects of
perception will become infinite. But when he reaches recognition, he
will be the objects of perception: the individual parts will be
boundless, and in his perception the infinity of the intellectual
world will become finite. (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>:
1:213&ndash;214; translations from this work are adapted from Rustom
2023a: passim)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="GodExiAtt">3. God, Existence, Attributes</h2>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s metaphysics begins with Ultimate
Reality, commonly referred to as the Self/Essence
(<em>al-dh&#257;t</em>) in Islamic thought. In line with his
epistemology as articulated in the previous section, he notes the
difficulty in saying anything about the Self, since It is the absolute
and infinite reality transcending all thought and description
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 269). The Absolute is the &ldquo;Reality
of reality&rdquo; in which there is no trace of multiplicity,
potentiality, or actuality. It is more like a geometrical point that
cannot be divided into anything, even though &ldquo;existence&rdquo;
emerges from It in the most perfect of ways
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 337; <em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;33). The supra-sensory reality
called the Self or the Eternal (<em>al-qad&#299;m</em>) is beyond
human perception, but Its existence can nevertheless be logically
demonstrated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Certain truth&rdquo; [cf. Quran 69:51] in proving the Eternal
lies in demonstrating It by way of that existence which is the most
general of things, for if there were not an Eternal in existence,
there would, fundamentally, not be an existent in existence
whatsoever. This is because existence divides into that which
encompasses the originated and the Eternal, that is, into that whose
existence has a beginning and that whose existence does not have a
beginning. If there were no Eternal in existence, there would,
fundamentally, not be that which is originated, since it is not in the
nature of that which is originated for it to exist by virtue of
itself. Indeed, that which is existent by virtue of itself is the
Necessary Existent. And that which is necessary in itself cannot be
conceived as having a beginning. (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As has already been demonstrated (Maghsoudlou 2016), &#703;Ayn
Qu&#7693;&#257;t often draws from Avicenna when incorporating rational
arguments into his philosophical Sufi worldview. The text just cited
is a fine example of how the Avicennan division of existence
(<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) into the necessary and the contingent gets
reinterpreted in philosophical Sufism via <em>kal&#257;m</em> or
Islamic rational theology (for more on this, see McGinnis &amp; Acar
2023). Existence is divided into that which is eternal and without a
beginning and that which originates in time. If we consider any
existent entity or process in the universe, we find that it is both
changing or temporal. However, something which originated in time must
need an external cause to initiate its existence since it cannot exist
by virtue of itself. Hence, we must assume an entity that is eternal
and exists by virtue of Itself, namely an entity that is self-caused.
Moreover, since this entity is necessary in Itself, It is
self-sufficient and does not depend on another cause for Its
existence. It also transcends temporal boundaries since time involves
change, and change is bound up in contingency. &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t further says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Thus, it can be said: [1] &ldquo;if there were an existent in
existence, it would necessarily entail that there be an Eternal in
existence&rdquo;. This is a certain premise: it is inconceivable for
anyone to doubt it. Then it can be said, [2] &ldquo;existence is
clearly known&rdquo;. This is the second premise, which, like the
first premise, is certain. Thereafter, [3] the existence of an Eternal
existent necessarily follows from these two firm premises. Such is the
demonstrative proof of the Eternal by way of existence. Be it succinct
or extended, a further exposition is inconceivable. (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a version of Avicenna&rsquo;s famous <em>burh&#257;n
al-&#7779;iddiq&#299;n</em> (&ldquo;the demonstration of the
ever-truthful&rdquo;) proof for the existence of God, except that
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t uses the terms
<em>&#7717;ud&#363;th</em> (temporal origination) and <em>qidam</em>
(eternity) instead of the modal terms <em>wuj&#363;b</em> (necessity),
<em>imk&#257;n</em> (possibility), and <em>imtin&#257;&#703;</em>
(impossibility). The premises that &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
invokes are uncontroversial, since even the radical skeptic has to
admit that there is existence even if he were to posit that reality is
some kind of simulation and not &ldquo;real&rdquo; as such. Similarly,
we may disagree about the nature of existence, but it would be hard to
argue that existence itself came out of pure nothingness (not relative
nothingness). This is true even when we are trying to explain
cosmogenesis through quantum gravity or, at bare minimum, certain laws
of physics. That is, those laws and initial conditions cannot be
nothing (it is apt to note here that some contemporary physicists
believe in the eternal or cyclical nature of the universe).</p>

<p>
However, one might argue that there is nothing wrong in imaging a
contingent initial natural causal state&mdash;contingent either
because the existence of the entities involved in that initial state
is contingent, or because at least some of the properties of the
entities involved in that initial state are contingent (Oppy 2013).
But for &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t and many others in the Islamic
intellectual tradition, contingent beings, by definition, lack
&ldquo;eternal necessity&rdquo;, which necessitates their
existentiation (<em>&#299;j&#257;d</em>) through something that must
have eternal necessity in itself. And only being or existence
(<em>wuj&#363;d</em>) fits the bill. Take any entity, such as a
triangle: it possesses an &ldquo;essential&rdquo; but not
&ldquo;eternal&rdquo; necessity. That is, in every possible world, the
definition of a triangle will hold, but that does not necessitate its
&ldquo;eternal&rdquo; existence. Even if we grant an infinite chain of
contingent beings, the series cannot become necessary except through
another cause, which ultimately proves that the series of a chain of
contingent beings necessarily terminates in that whose existence is
necessary in Itself.</p>

<p>
Although from one point of view, the Divine Self is beyond names and
descriptions, from another point of view, It manifests Itself and
hence enters into a relationship with the cosmos. These relationships
are indefinite, and each one of them can be described through a given
divine name or attribute. Moreover, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
avers, the divine names have a specific spiritual significance for the
traveler or wayfarer on the Sufi path (<em>s&#257;lik</em>), since
they are associated with subtle states that are closely linked to his
action in the world:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
God has a thousand and one names, and in every name He discloses
Himself in a thousand ways. Every kind of self-disclosure gives rise
to a state in the wayfarer, and every state brings forth a subtlety
and a different action in him. (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:74)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A perennial theological problem that arises here is the question of
how God&rsquo;s oneness can remain uncompromised in the face of
multiple divine names. That is, if God is one, how does His having
multiple attributes and names not introduce multiplicity in Him?
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t seems to follow the standard
Ash&#703;ar&#299; position regarding the relationship between the
Essence and Its attributes. He acknowledges the difficulty in holding
the position that seeks to affirm the divine attributes while also
asserting that they do not negate the Essence&rsquo;s unity and
simplicity. He thus prefers to think of the divine attributes as
subsisting in the Divine Essence (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 304),
giving the analogy of the sea and its drops by suggesting that the
statements, &ldquo;A drop is other than the sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;A
drop is from the sea&rdquo;, are both correct
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 336). Similarly, water is called by
different names in different languages, but they all refer to the same
object, which is to say that the Essence is called by many names that
all refer to the same reality (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 263).</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t has more to say about the relationship
between God&rsquo;s Essence and Its attributes by positing that each
attribute is a perfection of the Essence that pertains to a specific
manifestation of the Essence in a perspectival
(<em>i&#703;tib&#257;r&#299;</em>) way. The Essence can hence be
described by &ldquo;power&rdquo; if we consider the existents as
objects of power, &ldquo;desire&rdquo; if we consider the existents as
the objects of desire, and &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; if we consider the
existents as objects of knowledge (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:144).
In other words, the entire universe can be described as a
self-objectivation of the Essence, which encompasses everything:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Thus, since this Essence is related to the effusion of the existents
that emerge from It, and it is known that they are contingents and
that it is undoubtedly the Necessary who brings the contingent into
existence, it is called &ldquo;power&rdquo; from the standpoint of
this relation between It and the existents, and sometimes it is called
&ldquo;desire&rdquo; from the standpoint of another relation. But the
weak-minded think that there is a difference between power and the
Powerful, and desire and the Desiring! This is the very limit of
rational reflection. (<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>:
&sect;81, with a slight modification)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another way to explain the divine attributes would be to say that
divine attributes such as knowledge imply that everything comes into
existence through God&rsquo;s knowledge. Similarly, divine power means
that something comes into existence from Him. According to &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, there is no conflict between these two
attributes, even though people understand them to be distinct by way
of habit (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:178).</p>

<p>
Although &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t talks of different categories
of being, namely the necessary and the contingent, being or existence
ultimately is one. More importantly, being or existence is identified
with the very reality of the Essence. And since contingent beings
cannot have being through themselves, they must have their being
through another, namely the Necessary. This means being is one,
despite the existence of multiplicity. Like Ghaz&#257;l&#299; before
him (see Chittick 2012: 72), this insight leads &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t to conclude that &ldquo;there is no self in
existence other than He&rdquo; (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>:
1:232&ndash;233), a point for which he argues as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Your existence is not outside of two possibilities: either it subsists
on its own or through the existence of something other than itself. If
it subsists on its own, then there is no distinction between your
existence and God&rsquo;s existence because there is not more than one
being in existence that subsists on its own&hellip;. And whatever does
not subsist on its own but subsists through something else does not
have [real] existence. Thus it necessarily follows that there is not
more than one being in existence, and that one existence is God.
(<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 3:398)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, nothing exists independent
of God since an independent order of existence alongside God&rsquo;s
would introduce two different orders of reality, each with its own
rules of existence. But since the multiplicity of entities that we
encounter do not display absolute unity, the implication is that
existence belongs only to God (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 3:397).
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t explains this further by drawing
attention to the Quran, which states that all things other than God
are perpetually evanescent. He gives the analogy of a form in a mirror
which is observation-dependent, perishing as soon as the observer
turns his gaze away from the mirror (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;95; see also section 6). The
oneness of being as conceived by &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t means
that all existent things are mysteriously plunged in God&rsquo;s
all-encompassing existence and that they derive their ontological
sustenance from God, who is none other than being itself.</p>

<p>
A corollary to this position is that nothing <em>can be there</em>
aside from being/existence. But this does not spell a form of
pantheism, since &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t is careful to note that
although God shares &ldquo;withness&rdquo; or coextensivity
(<em>ma&#703;iyya</em>) with things, nothing shares the rank of
withness with God&rsquo;s existence (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;116). This argument leads him
to commit to the position that God is ontologically and logically
prior to everything. Ultimately, for &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t,
being&rsquo;s necessity, uniqueness, and oneness means that only God
<em>truly</em> exists, while all other things only <em>appear</em> to
exist&mdash;existing relationally at best&mdash;as they derive their
existence from God. For &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, this truth
requires spiritual insight to fathom, since conventional ways of
knowing are incapable of demonstrating it. But for the person of
realized inner vision, he sees God as being with all things, while at
the same time being both logically and ontologically prior to them
(<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;141).</p>

<h2 id="SelInwHea">4. Selfhood, Inwardness, Heart</h2>

<p>
The Sufi idea of <em>ma&#703;rifa</em> or recognition is often related
to a well-known Arabic maxim, &ldquo;He who recognizes himself, will
recognize his Lord&rdquo;. With this saying in mind, our philosopher
drives home the fact that those who do not have self-recognition
(attained through self-cultivation) can never recognize God, thus
remaining strangers to their true selves:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One must recognize himself so that he may recognize his Lord. They do
not have self-recognition, so how can they have recognition of God?!
They are estranged. (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 178; translations
from this work adapted from Rustom 2023a: passim)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But self-recognition that leads to a knowledge of God cannot be had
through the self qua self. Rather, one should strive to know God
through God. This is because the self, i.e., the lower self, stands in
the way of true knowledge of God. The seeker must therefore seek
self-recognition through God, who lies at the root of human
consciousness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But you are with yourself. When you find something, it is like finding
yourself. The seekers and lovers of God seek Him through Him. So they
find Him through Him. The veiled ones seek Him through themselves. So
they see themselves, and have lost God. What do you hear? Do not
consider this a trifling statement! (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>:
319)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, &ldquo;through Him&rdquo;
specifically means &ldquo;through God&rsquo;s light&rdquo;. Since
light is synonymous with existence, it is the source through which one
can come to know one&rsquo;s own self. Such an insight between the
relationship between light and existence anticipates
Suhraward&#299;&rsquo;s well-known theory of light and its
manifestation (<em>&#7827;uh&#363;r</em>), which is used to explain
consciousness (see the entry on
 <a href="../suhrawardi/">Suhrawardi</a>).
 But for &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, since the universe manifests
God&rsquo;s names and attributes, by directing one&rsquo;s gaze to it,
the seeker can come to a knowledge of the divine. But God&rsquo;s
light is equally displayed in the heart of the seeker, and hence by
delving into one&rsquo;s inner being, which in turn reflects the
universe, one may attain true self-recognition
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 273). Moreover, in self-recognition, the
knowing subject no longer posits an &ldquo;other&rdquo; or
&ldquo;object&rdquo; outside of themselves to be known. The more they
recognize their true self, the more will they recognize its contents,
which are God&rsquo;s attributes buried deep within their soul (Rustom
2023a: 153&ndash;158).</p>

<p>
As alluded to already, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t places a premium
on a person&rsquo;s finding and knowing God through their inner self.
The way to God is always open to a real seeker (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;176), which itself implies
sincerity in the act of seeking (<em>&#7789;alab</em>) and
discipleship (Persian, <em>ir&#257;dat</em>), namely the guidance of a
realized spiritual master. It is important to note here that for
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, the spiritual path is not simply
&ldquo;out there&rdquo;, awaiting discovery. Rather, the path to
Ultimate Reality is inside the self, moving from guidance that is
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; the self (i.e., the help of a spiritual master)
to the more inward cultivation of self-recognition, namely
inwardness.</p>

<p>
It comes as no surprise to learn that &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
underscores the need to look within to find the true self, which is
synonymous with the immanent divine presence. He makes it clear that
the path to God is neither on earth nor in the heavens, nor in any
posthumous states. Rather, the path to God is to be found in the inner
recesses of one&rsquo;s selfhood (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 24).
The more one journeys the spiritual path, the more one comes to
realize that one is not the seeker but the one who is sought. That is,
it is not a person&rsquo;s desire that takes them to God since
God&rsquo;s desire is prior to their desire
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 19). Such a call for an inward turn does
not mean one should neglect the legal and outward aspects of religion
identified with the Sharia (i.e., the Divine Law). Rather, the Sharia
itself is now redefined in terms of inwardness because for &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, the Sharia is &ldquo;the straight path of
reality, and anyone who missteps on the path loses his own reality and
throws himself into error&rdquo;. And this because &ldquo;the path is
the inner reality of the human being&rdquo;
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 289&ndash;290).</p>

<p>
Closely related to inwardness is the notion of the &ldquo;heart&rdquo;
(<em>qalb</em>; Persian, <em>dil</em>), which is a standard term in
Sufi psychology (see Nasr &amp; Ogunnaike 2024). Sufis such as
Ghaz&#257;l&#299; distinguish between the physical heart, which pumps
blood, and the subtle, spiritual heart, which is the locus of
perception (see Faruque 2023). Others describe it as the center of
human emotions by placing it in the middle of the Platonic tripartite
soul, with reason on top and appetite at the bottom. At the deepest
level, the heart is identified with the consciousness of the divine at
the center of one&rsquo;s being, and it is this dimension of the heart
that occupies &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t attention:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The seekers of God search for Him inside their selves because He is in
the heart, and the heart is in their inner reality. This is strange to
you, but whatever is in the heavens and on the earth, God has created
all of it in you. (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 287)</p>

<p>
Anyone who circumambulates the heart will find the goal, and anyone
who errs and loses his way on the path of the heart will become so
distant that he will never find himself. (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>:
24)</p>

<p>
Search for the heart and grab hold of it!
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 146)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alongside being the locus of the divine presence, the heart has a
self-reflexive ability to know itself and to come to see itself as
being uniquely suited to being the object of the divine gaze (Persian,
<em>na&#7827;arg&#257;h-i khud&#257;</em>)
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 146). However, not every heart or the
inmost center of the self can radiate the divine presence. Only a
heart that is free of such dispersive characteristics and tendencies
as negative thoughts and emotions can act as a locus for God&rsquo;s
self-contemplation. Or, as &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t simply puts
it, &ldquo;God does not have any condition for you but that you empty
your heart&rdquo; (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 2:92). With God&rsquo;s
eyes fixed upon a person&rsquo;s pure heart, the heart can act as a
source of moral conscience. &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t thus asks us
to consult the &ldquo;mufti of our heart&rdquo; when facing moral
dilemmas, provided we have overcome the vagaries and impulses of our
lower selves (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 197&ndash;198).</p>

<h2 id="GooEviAge">5. Good, Evil, Agency</h2>

<p>
Following a long-standing tradition in Islamic thought, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t identifies existence with light
(<em>n&#363;r</em>). God as the Necessary Existent is consequently the
Necessary Light, or what our philosopher calls &ldquo;the Illuminator
of all other lights&rdquo; (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 255). One
major implication of this position is that, just as all other existent
things are unreal (i.e., they exist through God&rsquo;s being) in
relation to the Necessary Being, when we speak of them as lights, they
are likewise unreal or metaphorical in relation to the Illuminator of
lights (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 256). At the top of the cosmic
hierarchy, God&rsquo;s light emanates in descending degrees of
intensity. The further away a thing is from the Source of cosmic
luminosity, the more darkness it exhibits, ontologically speaking.
Since for &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t God is pure goodness, it is to
the degree that things participate in God&rsquo;s light that they
exhibit this goodness. Thus, the further a thing is away from God and
the darker it is, the less goodness will it display. Yet since all
things participate in the order of existence/light, there cannot be
non-existence/darkness per se. This is why &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, who inveighs against the Zoroastrian view in
support of the ontological reality of evil (see Rustom 2020:
74&ndash;75), argues for the ultimate unreality of evil. He states his
position by arguing for the relational (<em>nisbat&#299;</em>) nature
of evil:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In general, one must say that, in itself, evil is nonexistent. That is
the truth, however far-fetched it is for human understanding. The
Messenger&rsquo;s statement and the scholarly consensus must be
interpreted&mdash;namely why they affirmed the existence of evil. This
is just like when the father and mother of a child call cupping
&ldquo;evil&rdquo; with reference to what is apparent and in relation
to the child&rsquo;s perception, since he can only perceive pain. But
the parents know the reality: cupping is not evil; rather, it is
good!</p>

<p>
Likewise, it is certainly known to the Prophets and Friends of God
that nothing but the good comes into existence from God and that all
of His actions are good. However, it might be that not everyone will
know that whatever exists is good and is not evil. The bad is
relational, but in itself it is nonexistent. Thus, the name
&ldquo;evil&rdquo; exists and is affirmed. Although from the
perspective of reality evil is nonexistent, it is merely affirmed as
such in accordance with the understanding of people. Yet the existence
of the reality of evil, in relation to God&rsquo;s mercy, generosity,
and bounty is known to be impossible. (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>:
2:294)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If, as &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t maintains, evil is ultimately not
real, then there is nothing in the cosmos but goodness in varied modes
of perfection and presence. At the same time, evil does have some kind
of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in our world, and this by virtue of its
relational nature. Relations, after all, are both real and
unreal&mdash;for example, the relationship between father and son
bespeaks a real fact that obtains between them on account of their
essential definitions; but, at the same time, this relationship has no
actual ontological status (i.e., it has no existence apart from those
existents that make up the relata of the said relationship).</p>

<p>
Like so many other post-classical Islamic philosophers, theologians,
and mystics, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s theodicy is clearly
influenced by Avicenna (see Shihadeh 2019), particularly the
metaphysics (<em>il&#257;hiyy&#257;t</em>) section of his famous
<em>Book of Healing</em> (<em>Kit&#257;b al-Shif&#257;&#702;</em>)
(<em>Kit&#257;b al-Shif&#257;&#702;</em>: IX.6), which itself was
informed by the substantial discussion in Plotinus&rsquo; (d. 270)
<em>Enneads</em> I.8. While Avicenna speaks of &ldquo;accidental
evils&rdquo; (<em>al-sharr al-&#703;ara&#7693;&#299;</em>), &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t refers to relational evils. As for
&ldquo;essential evil&rdquo; (<em>al-sharr al-dh&#257;t&#299;</em>),
namely a thing&rsquo;s non-realization in a substrate for which it was
intended (such as blindness <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> the ocular
faculty), &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t in all but name acknowledges
its presence since evil/darkness in his worldview is tantamount to the
non-realization of existence/light; this is to say that the privation
of existence/light results in the emergence of evil/darkness in the
cosmos (Rustom 2020: 76&ndash;77).</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t also confronts the objective nature of
evil as a necessary and real feature of the sublunar realm, despite
the fact that, as Avicenna did before him (Avicenna, <em>Kit&#257;b
al-Shif&#257;&#702;</em>: IX.6), he argues that all things in
existence display complete perfection and beauty. Beyond our
subjective likes and dislikes, accidental evils are a result of the
existence of this perfection itself, which is inscribed upon the
nature of things. Thus, water nourishes a fish but can drown a person,
rain is beneficial for someone but can destroy a home, and fire is a
source of warmth but can also burn somebody
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 186; <em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:401).
As for absolute evil, it cannot be present in the world as that would
entail fissures and imperfection in the cosmic order
(<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:343). But the presence of relational
evils in the world does not for &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t
compromise God&rsquo;s goodness, nor does it point to any kind of
imperfection in the world (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 122).</p>

<p>
If relational evils are a part of the order of nature, so too is the
presence of secondary causes. &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t ultimately
relates them back to God&rsquo;s agency or habit (<em>sunna</em>),
which itself is identified with the very workings of the nature and
structure of the world. As such, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s
theory of causation is firmly rooted in a worldview that sees it as
resultant from a form of divine compulsion (Maghsoudlou 2016: 277;
Rustom 2020: 79&ndash;84). As for human beings, they are
simultaneously implicated into this grand scheme of causal constraint,
but also have restricted freedom of action&mdash;albeit not a
libertarian form of freedom (Rustom 2020: 80).</p>

<p>
As with his treatment of the relational nature of evil, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s theory of human action is formed in part
as a response to another group of &ldquo;dualists&rdquo;, that is, the
Mu&#703;tazila. Apart from being moral dualists (see Rustom 2023a:
81), he sees them as adhering to a position to the effect that there
is no type of compulsion that informs human choice
(<em>ikhtiy&#257;r</em>). Rather, people can and do always act freely.
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t maintains that human beings have free
choice in their actions, but the freedom in question is a kind of
compelled (<em>mu&#7693;&#7789;arr</em>) constrained freedom:
&ldquo;Through his choice, man is compelled, overpowered, and
subjugated&rdquo; (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 3:338). What this means
is that human beings are compelled to act by virtue of the quality of
choice that is a part of their nature (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>:
3:338). Although the idea that human beings are compelled to act
freely goes back to Avicenna (Avicenna,
<em>al-Ta&#703;l&#299;q&#257;t</em>: 124&ndash;125), one of &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s main aims in drawing on this idea is to
demonstrate a perfect parallel between his cosmology of secondary
causal constraint and his theory of human constrained action
(Maghsoudlou 2016: 276&ndash;277). When it comes to constrained
action, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t approaches this problem from
many angles, the most concrete example of which is inextricably tied
to his treatment of love.</p>

<h2 id="ImaBeaLov">6. Imagination, Beauty, Love</h2>

<p>
Many thinkers in post-Avicennan Islamic thought attempted to translate
their abstract philosophical ideas into concrete forms through a
process called &ldquo;imaginalization&rdquo; (<em>tamaththul</em>),
which derives from Quran 19:17 (Rustom 2023a: 102&ndash;104). They did
so largely through storytelling, poetry, music, and other artistic
forms, thereby highlighting a unique dimension of later Islamic
thought in which arcane and theoretical ideas accessible to a small
group of highly trained philosophers were now graspable by a much
larger group of intellectuals, artists, and laypeople (for
storytelling in Islamic thought, see Zargar 2017; see also Harb 2020
for the wider and related usage of <em>tamth&#299;l</em> in Arabic
literature). Imagination in general and the imaginal world
(<em>&#703;&#257;lam al-khay&#257;l</em>) in particular were seen as
unique spaces that allow for the coming together of the seemingly
opposed &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; of meaning (<em>ma&#703;n&#257;</em>) and
form (<em>&#7779;&#363;ra</em>) (for different conceptions of
imagination, see Chittick 1989 and van Lit 2017). Imagination came to
refer to a process whereby meaning, which comes from a realm that is
changeless, immaterial, and non-dual, interpenetrates form, which is
characterized by change, corporeality, and duality. The function of
imagination is often likened to dreams and mirrors since they both
re-present to the observer images that are simultaneously there and
not there, thereby pointing up their in-between-ness or unique
ontological middle ground between existence and nonexistence.
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t explains it in this way with respect to
mirrors:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
From the perspective of reality, everything in existence is
transitory, and the only thing that remains is the face of the Living,
the Self-Abiding. It is just like a transitory form in a
mirror&mdash;only the form outside the mirror remains insofar as
general observation is concerned, satisfied as it is with sensory
imagery. In the eyes of the recognizer, the form outside the mirror is
also transitory, just like the form inside the mirror, with no
distinction between them. (<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>:
&sect;95)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t develops his theory of imaginalization
in a variety of ways, relating it to the various posthumous states
after death, understanding of scripture, and experience of beauty
(see, respectively, Rustom 2023a: 106&ndash;109, 173&ndash;185, and
248&ndash;260). Imaginalization also comes part and parcel with
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s wide-ranging exposition of love
(<em>&#703;ishq</em>, <em>ma&#7717;abba</em>; Persian,
<em>d&#363;st&#299;</em>) in which he attempts to communicate through
various angles of vision the interplay between lover and Beloved and
how the lover can participate in the Beloved&rsquo;s Self-love and
Self-revelation by beholding the Beloved in multiple forms, images,
sounds, and modes of beauty:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If love did not have the ruse of imaginalization, all the travelers on
the path to God would become unbelievers because, in most moments,
they would see everything in one form and in one state only. In seeing
the moment like that, it would be one of blame. But when one sees
increase in beauty and an added form at every instant or every day,
love becomes greater and the desire to see the object of one&rsquo;s
yearning greater. At every instant, <em>He loves them</em> [Quran
5:54] is imaginalized for <em>they love Him</em>, and <em>they love
Him</em> is, likewise, imaginalized. Thus, in this station, the lover
sees the Beloved at every instant in another form of beauty, and
herself in a more perfect and more complete form of love.
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 124&ndash;125)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s doctrine of imaginalization is
best exemplified in his retelling of the story of Ibl&#299;s or Satan.
He notes that careful attention to this tale will unlock many doors
for its listeners: &ldquo;If anyone in existence knew how to listen to
the tale of Ibl&#299;s, especially its mysteries, his tale would
become extremely dear to him&rdquo; (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>:
2:416). In discussing what in Islamic thought is known as
<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d Ibl&#299;s</em> or the devil&rsquo;s monotheism
(see Awn 1983), &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t is following a
well-trodden path first paved by the famous tenth century Sufi martyr
&#7716;all&#257;j (d. 922), who was then proceeded by a number of
major figures such as A&#7717;mad Ghaz&#257;l&#299;,
San&#257;&#702;&#299; (d. 1131), and &#703;A&#7789;&#7789;&#257;r (d.
1221). The <em>taw&#7717;&#299;d Ibl&#299;s</em> doctrine derives from
the Quran (particularly 7:11&ndash;25), where God asks Ibl&#299;s to
bow down to His newest creation, Adam. But Ibl&#299;s refuses, citing
his superiority over Adam. God consequently expels Ibl&#299;s from His
presence and Ibl&#299;s becomes the misguider of humanity (note that
in the Quran and the Islamic tradition, Ibl&#299;s is never identified
with evil per se). For the likes of &#7716;all&#257;j and A&#7717;mad
Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, Ibl&#299;s&rsquo; refusal to bow to Adam was not on
account of obstinacy but simply because he could only bow to his
Source and first love. Ibl&#299;s is thus at core a monotheist who
will always remain patient in the face of all forms of adversity, even
if it be &ldquo;blame&rdquo; from God Himself (see Rustom 2020).</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s dramatized and imaginalized
presentation of the story of Ibl&#299;s turns out to be a masterful
way of expounding his action theory in concrete form. It also ties
into his understanding of love. Just like human beings, who are
&ldquo;compelled&rdquo; into action, Ibl&#299;s is also compelled into
action. The difference here is that human action is informed by the
inherent quality of choice, whereas Ibl&#299;s&rsquo; actions are
informed by the inherent quality of love, which leaves him
choiceless:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The lover is choice-less. Whatever the lover does comes into existence
without his desire, and issues forth without his choice.
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 238)</p>

<p>
Alas! What can be said about love? What indication of it is worthy and
what explanation can be given? When entering love, a person should
surrender and not be with himself. He should abandon himself and
prefer love over himself. (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>:
96&ndash;97)</p>

<p>
Ibl&#299;s &ldquo;chose&rdquo; separation from the Beloved over
prostration to someone else. How excellent was his perfection of love!
<em>The gaze swerved not, nor did it transgress</em> [Quran 53:17].
(<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 1:96)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t insists that in his perfect, selfless
love, Ibl&#299;s has many things to teach human beings. One of these
is the cultivation of aspiration for divine proximity and the lack of
&ldquo;self&rdquo; interest, regardless of what obstacles might stand
in the way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One must be an aspirant of the quality of Ibl&#299;s so that something
comes from him. How fine was his aspiration! He said, &ldquo;I am
ready for endless pain, so give me the eternal mercilessness that is
my due!&rdquo; (<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 2:187)</p>

<p>
The madness of love is of better worth than the cleverness of the
entire world!&hellip; Whoever is not a lover is a self-seer. To be a
lover is to be selfless and pathless. (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>:
98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The imaginalized depiction of the story of Ibl&#299;s ultimately
allows &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t to turn to love itself as
fundamentally grounded in the nature of things, which is where his
theory of the &ldquo;stage beyond reason&rdquo; comes full circle.
According to &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, divine love is one of the
special attributes of the stage beyond reason (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;65); when a person experiences
it, speech reveals itself to be rather hopeless in articulating its
reality:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Love is one of the things specific to the stage beyond reason. For
those who have witnessed the states of love, there is no doubt that
reason is far from perceiving these states. To the understanding of
the person restricted by his reason and who has not had an intimate
taste of love, there is no way for the lover to convey the meaning of
that love with which he is so intimate. That can only happen when such
a person stands in the same position as the lover who tastes love.
(<em>Zubdat al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;71)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t sees it, love and God are one, and
all human beings are objects of divine love. But he also maintains
that human beings are likewise lovers of God. This leads him to
explain the subtle dynamics of what can be called the &ldquo;circle of
love&rdquo;, where the subject of love is simultaneously its object.
To make sense of this all-encompassing vision of love, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t urges us to enter the school of love as students:
&ldquo;Be a student! For love suffices as your teacher&rdquo;
(<em>N&#257;ma-h&#257;</em>: 2:128). When entering the school of love,
the seeker should surrender and abandon himself, preferring love over
everything else (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 96&ndash;97). Time and
again, &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t emphasizes how a person should
have sincerity and purity of intention when embarking on the path of
love, seeking the Beloved from the bottom of their heart. The reality
of the search for the Beloved comes to fruition when the gaze of the
seeker is entirely turned towards the Sought. &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t provides us with an analogy of iron&rsquo;s
attraction to a magnet to explain this state of sincere seeking:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The reality of seeking obtains when the gaze of the seeker is entirely
turned toward the sought. It is then that seeking and finding are
twins. The reality of this search can be expressed by the attraction
of iron to a magnet: if the iron is unalloyed, the magnet will attract
it, with nothing to impede the iron&rsquo;s attraction to the magnet.
But if the iron is mixed with some gold, silver, or the like, this
will compromise its attraction. Likewise, when the iron is
uncontaminated, its fully actualized attraction to the magnet will
ensue. It is then that finding&mdash;namely the iron reaching the
magnet&mdash;will necessarily occur. (<em>Zubdat
al-&#7717;aq&#257;&#702;iq</em>: &sect;72, with slight
modifications).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, love is a fire that burns and turns
everything into its own color, thereby reducing the lover to
nothingness (see Rustom 2022). In order to experience true love, a
person must be selfless and traceless, like Ibl&#299;s, making their
concern solely with love itself (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 98).
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t also relates the divine-human love
relationship to the standard Persian Sufi imagery of the moth
(Persian, <em>parw&#257;na</em>) and candle (<em>sham&#703;</em>). The
moth, which symbolizes the lover, naturally lunges itself into the
candle, which symbolizes the divine Beloved. All that the moth wants
and sees is the fire of the candle. When it throws itself into the
candle&rsquo;s fire, neither moth nor moth-hood remain. All that
remains is the fire of love:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Without the fire, the moth is restless, but in the fire it does not
have existence. So long as the moth flutters around the fire of love,
it sees the entire world as fire. And when it reaches the fire, it
throws itself in its midst. The moth does not know how to
differentiate between the fire and other than the fire. Why? Because
love itself is all fire. (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 99)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It would not be an understatement to claim that &ldquo;love&rdquo; is
the lens through which &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t looks at the
reality of religion itself. He often approaches the topic in the
context of his treatment of a famous Prophetic saying that speaks of
Islam as being divided into seventy-two or seventy-three
sub-communities. The word for &ldquo;sub-community&rdquo; is
<em>madhhab</em> (pl. <em>madh&#257;hib</em>), and can also mean
&ldquo;school of thought&rdquo;, &ldquo;position&rdquo;, and even
&ldquo;religion&rdquo;. This explains why &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t understands the reference to Islam&rsquo;s being
divided into seventy-two <em>madh&#257;hib</em> as not sub-communities
within the particular religion of Islam, but as so many different
religious traditions within the more universal category of
&ldquo;Islam&rdquo; or submission to God (for &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s approach to religious diversity, see
Boylston 2021). The underlying meaning of these various
<em>madh&#257;hib</em> &ldquo;is displayed to a person who has gone
beyond the seventy some-odd differing religions&rdquo; and who sees
all things as rooted in God, the &ldquo;Source of existents&rdquo;
(<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 304&ndash;305).</p>

<p>
For &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, a person who sees these different
religions as distinct is better described as a &ldquo;separator&rdquo;
than a &ldquo;seeker&rdquo; (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 21). Indeed,
each of these ways are simply &ldquo;waystations on the path to
God&rdquo; (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 285), and the path to God is
nothing other than religion. The &ldquo;religion&rdquo; in question is
what is known in the Persian Sufi tradition as <em>madhhab-i
&#703;ishq</em> or the &ldquo;Religion of Love&rdquo;. For &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t, the religion of love emphasizes unity and oneness
instead of divisions and factions, which cause people to veer into the
direction of multiplicity, disunity, and dispersion. That is why he
says that &ldquo;The partisans of the seventy-two religions dispute
with one another, are opposed to everyone else because of their creed,
and kill one another&rdquo;. But if only they had listened to his
words, he advises, they would have realized &ldquo;that everyone
follows one religion and one creed&rdquo;, which is the creed of the
lovers (<em>Tamh&#299;d&#257;t</em>: 339). When it comes to these
lovers of God, love is the only true religion, and nothing else will
suffice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let me start a fire, setting aflame this religion and creed!
<br />
I put love for You in place of religion.</p>

<p>
How long shall I contain this hidden love in my wounded heart?
<br />
The goal of the path is neither religion nor creed, but You.

<h2 id="RecInfLeg">7. Reception, Influence, Legacy</h2>

<p>
Along with Ghaz&#257;l&#299; and a handful of other authors, &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s Arabic and Persian writings were
historically influential upon intellectual and spiritual authors
working in both these languages well into the early modern period. By
the thirteenth century, Persian Sufi authors such as &#703;Az&#299;z
al-D&#299;n Nasaf&#299; (d. before 1300) were drawing on his work.
This influence can also be found in such famous figures as &#703;Abd
al-Ra&#7717;m&#257;n J&#257;m&#299; (d. 1492), a follower of Ibn
&#703;Arab&#299; who read both &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s
Arabic and Persian writings, and the Safavid philosopher Mull&#257;
&#7778;adr&#257; (d. 1640), who drew on &#703;Ayn
al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s unique theory of the Quran in developing
his own scriptural hermeneutics (see Rustom 2012: 31&ndash;32).
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s Persian writings were also
well-received in Ottoman Sufi circles, particularly among followers of
the great Sufi poet R&#363;m&#299; (d. 1273). His metaphysics and Sufi
theology as expounded in <em>Paving the Path</em> and the
<em>Letters</em> was specifically influential upon a variety of Indian
Sufi authors for over five centuries, having been commented upon in
Persian, naturalized into popular Indian Sufi sermons, and translated
into languages such as Dakhini.</p>

<p>
As far as &#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t&rsquo;s Arabic writings go,
shortly after his death <em>Essence of Reality</em> became one of the
most important curricular texts in the famous Madrasa Muj&#257;hidiyya
in Maragha (about 280 miles northwest of Hamadan). The core syllabus
at this school was a major anthology of philosophical Sufism which
included works by the likes of al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (d. 950),
Avicenna, Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, and &#703;Umar b. Sahl&#257;n
al-S&#257;w&#299; (d. after 1143). At the Muj&#257;hidiyya, a number
of highly influential Muslim philosophers read <em>Essence of
Reality</em>, including such giants as Suhraward&#299; and Fakhr
al-D&#299;n al-R&#257;z&#299; (d. 1210). It is also said that
Na&#7779;&#299;r al-D&#299;n &#7788;&#363;s&#299; (d. 1274) had
translated it into Persian while establishing his observatory in
Maragha. A number of Ibn &#703;Arab&#299;&rsquo;s later Arab
followers, such as al-N&#257;bulus&#299; (d. 1731), made good use of
the metaphysics and epistemology enshrined in the <em>Essence of
Reality</em>, which also seems to have influenced later authors in
British India, as is evidenced in the work of Fa&#7693;l-i &#7716;aqq
Khayr&#257;b&#257;d&#299; (d. 1861) (see Rustom 2023a:
18&ndash;21).</p>

<p>
&#703;Ayn al-Qu&#7693;&#257;t is to this day a celebrated figure in
Iran and beyond. In his native Hamadan there is a large cultural
complex dedicated to his life, image, execution, and legacy. His
writings are commonly taught in institutions of higher learning in
Canada, France, Germany, Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States, are the subjects of scholarship and major commentaries,
and continue to be anthologized (most recently in Adamson &amp;
Benevich 2023: 343&ndash;344, 507&ndash;509; Rustom 2023a; Rustom
forthcoming) and translated into various languages (see bibliography
in Rustom 2023a).</p>
