<h1>The Philosophy of Dance</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jan 12, 2015; substantive revision Wed Sep 3, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
What counts as &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; of dance? This is a vexed
methodological question. The array of academic approaches undertaken
to promote serious investigation into the distinctive nature, and
human importance, of dancing evidences the complexity of capturing
movement in words. Some writers utilize tools familiar from
Anglo-American analytic philosophical traditions. Others develop
conceptual resources from existentialism, phenomenology and, more
recently, somaesthetics. Many equally rigorous ways of addressing
philosophically resonant aspects of dance are pursued by thinkers who
start from embodied or practice-based foundations. Thought-provoking
analyses incorporate insights and methods used by dance studies
scholars, sociologists, historians, educators, anthropologists,
ethnographers, practitioners, dance critics, evolutionary biologists,
cognitive scientists, and psychologists. As a field, philosophy of
dance has grown to encompass an array of resources needed to
understand the varied cultural and personal dimensions of dancing.</p>

<p>
The potential for this area of inquiry is enormous. This is, in part,
because dance engages many branches of philosophy, including
metaphysics, epistemology, the philosophy of mind, ethical theory,
aesthetics, and the philosophy of art. The topic is also
intellectually rich because humans have danced throughout all of
recorded history for artistic, educational, therapeutic, social,
political, religious and other purposes. In addition, there are
dance-like undertakings on the margins of what many regard as
dance-proper, such as digital/animated dance or forms of competitive
dancing analogous to sports like gymnastics or ice-skating (see McFee
1992). As a result, the question of what counts as &ldquo;dance&rdquo;
can arise readily alongside the question of what counts as the
philosophy <em>of</em> dance, generating both philosophical and
meta-philosophical opportunities for sustained deliberation.</p>

<p>
The challenge for any scholar in dance philosophy is to draw together
a multiplicity of approaches and concerns so they are in productive
dialogue with one another. While there are marked differences in
academic style across the field, all participants have an intellectual
stake in illuminating our dancerly lives so we might better understand
just <em>what</em> dance is and appreciate <em>why</em> it matters.
The primary aim of this entry is to introduce several basic families
of concern that recur across disciplinary domains and to offer
resources for further research at the end of each section.</p>

<h2 id="AnalOntoDancArt">1. Analytic Approaches to Dance as Art</h2>

<p>
Although many dance-related topics have been treated by philosophers
of a broadly analytic persuasion, thinkers in this intellectual
community have had an overriding interest in dance qua artform. Hence,
they have attended primarily to concert or theater dance, and have
given sustained thought to three central questions: What is the
difference between a movement event that is dance and one that is
non-dance? (The definitional question.) What kind of thing is a work
of dance art? (The ontological question.) What conditions must be
satisfied for the same work of dance art to be performed on multiple
occasions? (The identity question.)</p>

<p>
The definitional question preoccupied a number of early contributors
to the field of dance philosophy from roughly the 1950s to the 1990s.
Their shared goal was to offer an account that could distinguish the
dancing in concert performances from other kinds of movement that
might be seen on stage and, thereby, to indicate what makes dance, as
a form of human moving, special. Well-known suggestions highlighted,
among other things, the expressive qualities of the movements
performed (Beardsley 1982), the symbolic potential of the movement
performance (Langer 1953a and b; cf. Conroy 2015), or the
performance&rsquo;s relationship to artistic institutions and dance
art practices (Carroll and Banes 1982). (See
 <a href="#DancAgenInteActi">Section 2</a>.)
 Several influential philosophers of dance, however, resisted the
definitional project, arguing that it must suffer from
underinclusivity given the wide array of extant dance styles and forms
(Sparshott 1988; cf. Sparshott 1995) or urging that the attempt to
offer essentialist definitions is futile (McFee 2021b). In recent
decades, attention in so-called &ldquo;analytic aesthetics&rdquo; has
shifted away from various attempts to define dance and toward
explorations that highlight its distinctiveness by emphasizing
metaphysical and appreciative issues.</p>

<p>
Those projects that address the ontological question introduced above
center on identifying <em>what kind of thing</em> the product of dance
art-making is&mdash;an object, an abstract entity, an event, a more
fluid process, or something else. It should be noted, however, that
philosophers differ with regard to which aspects of dance as art
should be given primacy of place for the purposes of pursuing
ontology. Dance art practices recognize an array of metaphysically
relevant features that one might aim to accommodate, including the
seemingly &ldquo;commonsense facts&rdquo; that many works of dance art
are repeatable (they can be performed on more than one occasion),
underdetermined (they permit of performances that differ qualitatively
from one another), created by humans at a certain time in history
(they are not eternally existing Forms), and potentially modally
flexible (the original dancemaker could have chosen some different
intrinsic or identity-constitutive features) (see Carroll 2019; D.
Davies 2011 and 2024; McFee 1992, 2011, and 2018; Pakes 2020).</p>

<p>
With considerations such as these in mind, several widely debated
ontological accounts of dance qua art have emphasized repeatable
choreographic structures. For Nelson Goodman, such structures are
typically described as being anchored metaphysically in an actual
score for the dance work that specifies its essential features
(Goodman 1976; cf. McFee 2012, Pakes 2020, and Van Camp 2019a). A
competing structure-based approach, defended by Graham McFee, argues
that works of dance art are types that can be tokened in live
performance, where the parameters of the type that constitutes any
particular dance artwork are established by an in principle possible
score or a work &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; (McFee 1992b, 2011b, and 2018).
Several more recent accounts depart from the details of McFee&rsquo;s
view, but embrace his core insight that works of dance art are
fundamentally &ldquo;performables&rdquo; that are also typically
multiples, i.e., they are works of art made for performance that can
have more than one correct instance. For example, No&euml;l Carroll
recasts the ontological question to ask, &ldquo;What makes something a
dance-art-work?&rdquo; and suggests that the answer lies in the
&ldquo;constitutive purposes&rdquo; of the choreography as these would
be appropriately understood by someone embedded in the particular
community for whom the dancemaker creates (Carroll 2019: 74). Other
more metaphysically complex alternatives include accounts that
construe dance artworks as indicated action-types answerable to both
contemporary danceworld norms and historical considerations (Pakes
2020) or as &ldquo;Wollheimian types&rdquo; grounded in dance art
appreciative practices (D. Davies 2024).</p>

<p>
Despite their differences, all such approaches are united insofar as
they stand in contrast to those adopted by dance philosophers who
think that the art-relevant focus of dance might be something other
than the structure of the dance &ldquo;work&rdquo; construed as some
kind of artistic <em>object</em>. Such thinkers tend to observe that
dance art creations typically lack supplementary texts and are often
developed without the use of any written plan (see Franko 1989, 2011a,
and 2017; and Pakes 2017). They also note that even when there is a
notated score, it is not always used as an &ldquo;essentialist
recipe&rdquo; for generating future performances as it may, instead,
serve as inspiration for a novel theatrical presentation (see Franko
1989). Furthermore, standardized dance notation systems are
controversial, and none is used or accepted universally (see Franko
2011a and Van Camp 1998). Finally, many philosophers begin their
theorizing from the belief that what makes dance art <em>special</em>,
and, therefore, worthy of focused philosophical attention, lies in
dance&rsquo;s bodily, tactile, dynamic, felt, perceived or intuited
aspects (sometimes referred to as its kinaesthetic or somatic
elements). For these theorists, the central foci of theory and
appreciation should be features of performance events and evolving
danceworld experiences, rather than static scores or underlying
abstract structures. (See
 <a href="#DancAgenInteActi">Sections 2 and 3</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
For more on the general question, &ldquo;What is dance?&rdquo;, see D.
Carr 1987; Carroll 2003, Copeland and Cohen 1983; McFee 1998a and
2013a; Pakes 2019b; Sparshott 1988; and Van Camp 1981. For more on
meaning, expression, authenticity and communication as central or
definitive aspects of dance art, see D. Carr 1997; Best 1974; Franko
2014b; Hanna 1983 and 1979 [1987]; Martin 1933a, 1939, and 1946; and
Van Camp 1996b. For an extended treatment of the dance art
appreciative practices to which an ontological account might aim to be
responsive, see D. Davies 2024. See also Meskin 1999 for an
alternative view of dancework ontology that holds that dance audiences
experience <em>three</em> works of art: a choreographic-work, a
production-work, and a performance-interpretation work; cf. Thom 2019.
For discussion of "dance as text" and a replete history of this idea,
see Franko 1993, 2011a, and 2011b; cf. Pakes 2020.</p>

<h3 id="ProbIdenReco">1.1 Problems of Identity and &ldquo;Re&rdquo;-Activities</h3>

<p>
The ontological question is pressing for many philosophers because it
bears directly on a number of other important issues pertaining to
dance preservation and dance art appreciation. As mentioned briefly
above, there are many potential &ldquo;problems of identity&rdquo; for
dance that arise in analytic aesthetics, where these are all related
to the basic issue of how the numerical identity of any given work is
secured across different performances (cf. Fraleigh 2004 for an
alternative usage of the word &ldquo;identity&rdquo; for dance). One
concern is that, as a matter of practice, the occasion on which a
dance is composed does not &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the creative product for
all time. Although dance works are usually known by the name and date
of their first performance, subsequent iterations and casts can change
structural and qualitative features of the inaugural presentation,
sometimes substantially. A related concern is that many dance art
creations simply have no notated score. Even for those that are
preserved via video or other form of tangible fixation, later
performances may still deviate from these frameworks in significant
ways.</p>

<p>
There are additional complications to consider. For example, in those
relatively rare cases where there is a score from which dance artists
work (roughly, as an architect builds from a blueprint), following
notated instructions might not produce performances that are
<em>experientially</em> identifiable as the &ldquo;same&rdquo; work of
art. Furthermore, a dance notation might function as the jumping-off
point from which to make a radically new kind of dance, rather than as
a limitation on innovation that constrains future choreographers and
dancers. There is also the issue that what a dance &ldquo;is&rdquo; in
practice, or for purposes of public appreciation, may not be identical
to what a dance &ldquo;is&rdquo; for purposes of numerical identity
and historical preservation. In this way dance is not unlike music
(for more on this see S. Davies 1991).</p>

<p>
Another complication arises from the fact that there are different
kinds of &ldquo;re&rdquo;-activities commonly undertaken in dance, and
the distinctions between them are not clear from the way language is
used by members of the danceworld. Philosophers of dance, dance
studies scholars, and practitioners, for instance, recognize the
possibility of re-performing a dance art creation, reviving one that
has languished but not fallen prey to the vicissitudes of time and
memory, reconstructing a &ldquo;lost&rdquo; piece of dance art history
from scholarly resources and personal interviews, and reenacting
historically important dance moments or ideas by mounting performances
that re-visit them in a new way. The possibility of returning to our
dance art past under these various descriptions raises a number of
questions. Is it desirable to attempt to reconstruct a work, or is it
more profitable to reenact important elements of a
choreographer&rsquo;s <em>oeuvre</em>? If historical reconstruction
aims to recover a forgotten piece of dance history, must it thereby be
understood as an enterprise that aims to preserve the numerical
identity of the reconstructed work? What is the difference (if any)
between revival and reconstruction, and why should dance insiders
pursue either of these &ldquo;re&rdquo;-activities rather than
creating new works of dance art? Can reenactment provide historical
knowledge about our dance pasts?</p>

<p>
For detailed treatment of these issues by multiple authors (who are
both theorists and practitioners), see anthologies edited by Jordan
2000, Franko 2017, and Main 2017<strong>.</strong> For more on various
issues surrounding dance work identity and
&ldquo;re&rdquo;-activities, see D. Carr 1997; Cohen 1982; Conroy
2013b; Franko 1989 and 2017b; McFee 1994, 1998a, and 2011b; Pakes 2017
and 2020; Rubidge 2000; Sparshott 1988 and 1995; Thomas 2018; and Van
Camp 1981 and 2019a. For more on the role of scores in dance, see
Armelagos and Sirridge 1978; D. Davies 2011b; Goodman 1976; McFee
2011b and 2018.</p>

<h3 id="DancEpheArt">1.2 Dance as an Ephemeral Artform</h3>

<p>
One feature of dance as a performing art that is often noted, and
contributes to the challenge of offering a philosophical answer to the
identity question, is that it moves and changes, both during the
course of any given performance and over time. A catchall phrase for
this sort of impermanence&mdash;reflecting the lack of entirely stable
art objects in this artistic milieu&mdash;is that &ldquo;dance is an
ephemeral art.&rdquo; While it admits of alternative interpretations
(see Conroy 2012; Copeland and Cohen 1983; Copeland 1993; Jollimore
2019; and Pakes 2020), in no case should this common locution be taken
to imply that dance art is insubstantial or unserious. Instead, it
signals that there is something vital about dance that disappears
<em>as</em> the dancers perform, and its use is often meant to
encourage philosophers to regard this as a significant, or even
central, feature of dance qua artform.</p>

<p>
To wit, dance critic Marcia Siegel famously wrote that dance
&ldquo;exists at a perpetual vanishing point&rdquo; which, for Siegel,
means that dance exists in &ldquo;an event that disappears in the very
act of materializing&rdquo; (1972: 1). She posits that artistic dance
escaped the mass marketing of the industrial revolution
&ldquo;precisely because it doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to any
reproduction&hellip;&rdquo; (1972: 5). The most conservative
ontological interpretation of Siegel&rsquo;s claims might be that
dance <em>performances</em> are one-time, transient events (Conroy
2012). This, however, would not be a philosophically consquential
reading because it is (relatively) uncontroversial that all theatrical
performances are events and all events are transient. Hence, what
seems to be at stake in describing dance art as ineluctably ephemeral
is the idea that its fleetingness is <em>more significant
appreciatively</em> than is the transience characteristic of the other
performing arts, such as music and theater. If this is true, then it
will be crucial for every full-blooded philosophical account of dance
to address the nature and aesthetic-artistic importance of its
fragility.</p>

<p>
One way to address this challenge is to adopt a negative view of the
ephemerality of dance art. To this end, one might argue that
dance&rsquo;s natural tendency to &ldquo;evaporate&rdquo; in real time
threatens the possibility of presenting the same dance artwork on
multiple occasions and, thereby, puts pressure on the idea that dance
falls under the &ldquo;classical paradigm&rdquo; discussed by D.
Davies (2011b) and upheld by Goodman (1976) and McFee (2011b and
2018). Another tactic is to emphasize facts about the practical
realities of life in the dance art community. Because dance artists do
not trade in writing scores or scripts, and dance practitioners are
highly tolerant of making adjustments for both artistic and pragmatic
reasons, many dance art creations simply do not survive for very long
unless they continue to be performed consistently.</p>

<p>
A contrary approach takes the ephemeral character of dance to be one
of its good-making features. On this positive view, we ought to
appreciate, rather than decry, dance&rsquo;s ever-changing and
disappearing nature (Jollimore 2019). Defenders of this view often
note that ephemerality is a key attribute that makes a performance of
a dance into a <em>vital experience</em> for both the dance performers
and the audience. The positive proposal celebrates the live nature of
the dance event and aims to explain why kinesthetic responses to dance
art performances could be both appreciatively relevant and viscerally
powerful. It also suggests that ephemerality might serve an important
aesthetic role for dance insofar as it provides a uniquely robust
&ldquo;you had to be there&rdquo; theatrical experience. (See
Bresnahan 2014a for an account of improvisational artistry in live
dance performance consistent with this perspective.) Depending on how
it is cashed out, this interpretation of the idea that dance
&ldquo;exists at a perpetual vanishing point&rdquo; might or might not
be tension with contemporary theoretical approaches that regard dance
art as in a new era of &ldquo;post-ephemerality&rdquo; (Franko
2018b).</p>

<h2 id="DancAgenInteActi">2. Dance, Action, and Agency</h2>

<p>
Philosophers of dance frame questions about action and agency in
markedly different ways, though most embrace the basic view that
dancing is an activity and, therefore, not something that can be done
accidentally (see McFee 1992, 2011b, and 2018). Those with an interest
in dance as a form of expert action (akin to sports) tend to center
their analyses on technical and athletic prowess, as well as on
artistic skills like moving with expressivity or grace, and to focus
on dance as art (see Montero 2016). Others with an interest in
vernacular or communal dance forms explore puzzles that can arise when
movers coalesce into temporary dancing communities that seem, for the
duration of the dance event, to have an agential component that
exceeds, and is distinct from, that of any particular dancer in the
group (see Kronsted 2021 and 2023). The presumption that dance is not
mere physical movement opens up a number of roles for intentional
action to play in any philosophical treatment of dance as art or
social activity.</p>

<p>
One family of philosophical interests is responsive to the
definitional question mentioned in
 <a href="#AnalOntoDancArt">Section 1</a>.
 To this end, one could characterize dance as an artform that involves
&ldquo;action&rdquo; in a specific way in virtue of its expressive
character. Dance historian Selma Jean Cohen (1962) claims that
expressiveness is present in all dance, inspiring Monroe C. Beardsley
(1982) to argue that this might be a necessary, if not sufficient,
condition for dance as art. Borrowing explicitly from action theory,
Beardsley notes that one bodily action can, under the right
circumstances, <em>sortally generate</em> another kind of action.
Thus, the act of running can, if conditions are right, become
artistically expressive and, thereby, be part of the performance of a
dance art creation (see Beardlsey 1982 and Van Camp 1981; cf.
Khatchadourian 1978, who argues that dance movements are <em>not</em>
actions).</p>

<p>
A famous alternative that also addresses definition, broadly
construed, is offered by Susanne K. Langer (1953b), who holds that
dance as art is a symbol-making endeavor. For Langer, dance&rsquo;s
symbolic character, or &ldquo;primary illusion&rdquo;, is what she
calls &ldquo;virtual power&rdquo; or gesture, in contrast to virtual
time (for music), virtual space (for the plastic arts) or the illusion
of life (for some poetry and some drama). This semiotic theory
implicates action in both the creation and performance of dance
artworks and suggests that dance art is constituted of much more
intentionally rich ingredients than mere movements or strings of
choreographic sequences. Sondra Horton Fraleigh (1996) offers a
different conceptual approach, but maintains with other authors
considered in this section that dance is necessarily expressive and
transitive <em>action</em>. (See Meskin 1999 for more on dances as
action sequences rather than mere movements. See Carroll and Banes
1982 for a critique of Beardsley&rsquo;s theory of dance as expressive
action.)</p>

<p>
Another set of concerns about action in dance relates more readily to
the ontological question (see
 <a href="#AnalOntoDancArt">Section 1</a>).
 For instance, Anna Pakes&rsquo; view of dance works as indicated or
initiated action-types appeals to action to articulate what kind of
things such artworks <em>are</em> at the most fundamental metaphysical
level (Pakes 2020). Pakes agrees that action is a necessary feature of
dance in general (2013) and, with Aaron Meskin (1999), urges that the
embodiment of dance in physical, intentional events renders works of
dance art better construed as created action-structures than eternal
types or Platonic Forms. Considerations about the embodied nature of
dancing also incline Pakes to be wary of the idea that there could be
such a thing as purely &ldquo;conceptual dance&rdquo;, i.e., a dance
artwork in which the actions that constitute the dancing are merely a
means to some further artistic-intellectual end (Pakes 2019a). A
distinct, but obliquely related, topic in this domain is how to
understand the <em>normativity</em> embedded in dance art as the
product of intentional actions undertaken in the appropriate contexts,
issuing from the right kind of psychological states (McFee 2021b).</p>

<p>
Other contemporary dance philosophers regard the minded
<em>agency</em> involved in creating choreography, performing dance,
or both, as a primary area of philosophical interest. Often their
accounts are connected to normative, epistemic and ontological
commitments about what dance is and why it matters. Many such
theorists (including Bresnahan 2014a, 2017a, and 2019b; Kronsted 2020
and 2023; Merritt 2015; and Montero 2016) utilize tools from both
analytic and phenomenological traditions, coupled with insights from
research in the cognitive sciences. (See
 <a href="#DancCognScie">Section 4</a>.)
 Some attend to the activities and agency of audience members qua
appreciators, but most focus on the intentional and embodied
activities of dancers.</p>

<p>
It is helpful to keep in mind that three disctinct, though not
mutually exclusive, kinds of agency are often explored in connection
with dance performers. First, there is a &ldquo;thin&rdquo; sense of
agency that simply distinguishes dancing persons from, say, Boston
Dynamic robots on the grounds that the former, but not the latter,
execute movements under intentional descriptions (McFee 2018). Second,
there is a &ldquo;thicker&rdquo; sense of agency that tracks the
degree to which dancers are afforded various kinds of opportunities to
make free decisions that express their intentionality, and unique
personalities, as they perform (Bresnahan 2014a). Third, there is a
phenomenon one might call &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; agency that refers to
cases in which dancers have the conflicted experience of being both
the authors of their movements and of losing executive control to a
partner or larger group (Kronsted 2021 and 2023).</p>

<p>
For more on dance agency and intentional action see Bunker, Pakes and
Rowell 2013; D. Carr 1987; J. Carr 2013; Conroy 2021; Noland 2009; and
Sheets-Johnstone 1981, 1999, 2011, and 2012.</p>

<h3 id="ChorAuthCopy">2.1 Choreography, Authorship, and Copyright</h3>

<p>
In an extension of the thicker sense of agency articulated above, Van
Camp (1980) holds that, for purposes of art-critical judgment and
artistic appreciation, it is sometimes the case that the dancer
&ldquo;creates&rdquo; and is not limited to merely interpreting the
dance that is viewed. Dancers often supply structural and stylistic
elements in the course of rehearsing and presenting a dance piece that
were neither specified, nor provided by, the choreographer during the
compositional process. If these additions are artistically
significant, then what the dancer contributes might be better
understood as a kind of dancerly &ldquo;creation&rdquo; than taken to
be a mere performance &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; of an already
completed work.</p>

<p>
This suggestion is opposed by McFee (2011b, 2013c and 2018), who
argues that works of dance art are <em>authored</em> by choreographers
but <em>embodied</em> by dancers to render the dancemaker&rsquo;s
creative choices visible to audiences. (See also Chris Challis 1999.)
On the choreographer-as-sole-dancework-creator view, the
dancer&rsquo;s role is both instrumental and subsidiary to the
dancemaker&rsquo;s vision. Furthermore, on this account, a
dancer&rsquo;s area of expertise qua embodier is the activity of
dancing, not dance-art-making. It follows from this that, while
dancers contribute the raw material for dance performances, they are
more like skilled technicians or artisans than author-artists.</p>

<p>
Two points are important to clarify this view. First, it does not
entail that choreographers cannot dance their own works; but it does
maintain that, in their role <em>as dancers</em> of works they have
created, they are to be assessed as interpreters rather than makers.
Second, it recognizes that dancers often contribute substantially to
the choreographic and qualitative contours of the works we see on
stage, but holds that these kinds of contributions are insufficient to
render the performers &ldquo;co-authors&rdquo; with the choreographer.
This is because it is the dancemaker, rather than the dancer, who
ultimately decides what elements of the work will be regarded as
necessary and what aspects will remain underdetermined, thereby
providing those who embody the work on stage opportunities to exercise
interpretive license in performance.</p>

<p>
This view has been criticized in various ways for neglecting the
artistic significance of the performers&rsquo; role in making and
performing dances (see Alpert 2016; Bresnahan 2013; and Pakes 2020).
It has also been suggested that the dancer might be rightly regarded
as a co-author (with the choreographer) of a different kind of
artistic product, the &ldquo;performed work&rdquo;, a concatenation of
the performable crafted by the dancemaker and the performance
interpretation created by the dancers (see Thom 2019). McFee (2018)
bolsters his controversial account with the idea that
<em>authorship</em> of dance artworks is, and should be, attributable
only to those who bear both generative and artistic responsibility for
them. This comes close to, yet stops short of, equating authorial
credit for dances with intellectual property rights. It is worth
noting, therefore, that it is by no means the case (particularly in
the U.S.) that those who create works of dance art are the persons
given public credit for, or granted legal copyright over, them.</p>

and 2016; Pakes 2020; and Van Camp 1994. For a book on dance,

<h3 id="DancImpr">2.2 Dance Improvisation</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Improvisation&rdquo; in dance often refers to the agency and
intentional action of dance-makers and performers (who might or might
not be the same people) rather than to the <em>result</em> of their
activity. Three kinds of improvisation in theater dance, as
articulated by Curtis Carter, are often discussed (Carter 2000: 182):
(1) embellishments where set choreography persists, (2) improvisation
as spontaneous free movement for use in established choreography, and
(3) improvisation for its own sake brought to a high level of
performance. An example of (1) is a case in which a dance performer is
allowed to amplify existing movements (doing a triple pirouette in
place of a double, for example) or permitted to add a stylistic
flourish (such as an extra flick of the wrist or tilt of the head). An
example of (2) is a sitution in which no choreography has been
provided for eight bars of music and the dancers are instructed to
move as they wish in this compositional gap. Finally, (3) covers cases
of what D. Davies (2011b) calls a &ldquo;work performance&rdquo;, that
is, situations in which a dance work is choreographed by the dancers
<em>while</em> dancing. It also includes cases where either the whole
performance, or a substantial part of it, is improvised from start to
finish. Dances comprised of Steve Paxton&rsquo;s &ldquo;contact
improvisation&rdquo;, for example, could count as improvisation in
this third sense (see Paxton 1975 and 1981).</p>

<p>
Danielle Goldman (2010) offers critical analysis of the idea of
&ldquo;freedom&rdquo; implicit in the second kind of improvisation.
She suggests that we examine social and historical constraints on the
genuine possibility of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, since creative liberty
cannot exist in oppressive cultural conditions where prohibitive
social and physical barriers prevail or exert pressure. Goldman thus
suggests an alternative conception of improvisation as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a rigorous mode of making oneself ready for a range of potential
situations&hellip;an incessant preparation, grounded in the present
while open to the next moment&rsquo;s possible actions and
constraints. (2010: 142)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Susan Leigh Foster (2003) shares Goldman&rsquo;s view that it is the
moment immediately <em>before</em> an actual dance movement occurs
that lends a distinctive aesthetic quality to dance improvisation when
used in art-presentational contexts. &ldquo;[I]t is,&rdquo; she
claims,&ldquo;this suspense-filled plenitude of the not-quite-known
that gives live performance its special brilliance&rdquo; (2003: 4).
She also offers a phenomenological account of the kind of agency
involved in dance improvisation, equating the lived experience of
improvising with the use of a &ldquo;middle voice&rdquo; in which a
dancer finds herself in a flow of movement that occupies an
intermediate position between deliberative choice-making and passive
direction.</p>

<p>
Dance philosophers have identified other forms of dance improvisation
that do not fit neatly into Carter&rsquo;s three categories. Kent de
Spain (2003), for example, draws attention to a kind of improvisation
practiced by dancers to achieve a movement-based somatic state.
Somatic improvisation, or the results of such improvisational
exercises, may be included in a theater performance for an audience,
but need not be. Constance Valis Hill (2003) includes &ldquo;challenge
dance&rdquo; performances, stemming from the African-American
tradition of dance &ldquo;battles&rdquo;, where the goal is to win an
ever-escalating competition of skill and style. Like somatic
improvisation, challenge dance improvisation can be offered for
audience appreciation in a concert context, but need not be&mdash;it
often takes place in social and street settings for pure entertainment
or socio-political purposes. In addition, Aili Bresnahan (2014a)
defends the claim that <em>all</em> live dance performance involves
improvisational artistry, and argues that the ineluctably
improvisatory nature of artistic dancing can be regarded as a form of
embodied and extended agency (continuous with 4-E accounts advanced in
the philosophy of mind, esp. Clark 2011).</p>

Improvisation&rdquo; in <em>The Journal of Aesthetics and Art

<h2 id="DancLiveExpeSomaAwar">3. Dance, Lived Experience, and Kinaesthetics</h2>

<p>
There are fields of philosophy, particularly in the Continental,
pragmatic, and non-Western traditions, that treat art as both an
activity and an experiential phenomenon. These approaches regard lived
experience, including its bodily and somatic aspects, as something
that can provide legitimate descriptive or causal evidence for
philosophical claims. Richard Shusterman has developed a distinctive
phenomenological theory, &ldquo;somaesthetics&rdquo;, to explain our
embodied engagement with all art, including dance, in a way that
includes various kinds of bodily awareness (see 2008, 2009, 2011a,
2011b, 2011c, 2012, and 2019). A commitment common to such thinkers is
that understanding dance, in all its forms, requires us to look beyond
the information provided by the projective sense modalities of sight
and hearing and to consider what, how, and why dance experiences make
us feel.</p>

<p>
For more on these general topics, see Dewey 1934; Merleau-Ponty 1945
and 1964; along with Berleant 1991; Bresnahan 2014b; Foultier and Roos

aesthetics), 2000, and 2018; Franko 2011b; and Sheets-Johnstone 1966
and 2015. Cf. Ness 2011 for an account of a shift in dance away from
phenomenology with Foucault. For more on dance and somatics, see Eddy
2002; Fraleigh 2015; Weber 2019; and Williamson et al. 2014. See also
LaMothe 2009; Pakes 2003, 2017a, and 2019; and Parvainen 2002 for work
on the related field of dance, the body, and epistemology.</p>

<h3 id="PrimPrac">3.1 The Primacy of Practice</h3>

<p>
Philosophers who treat lived experience as legitimate evidence for
theory are firmly committed to the validity of practice in the
philosophy of dance. Thinkers at home in analytic aesthetics, however,
often find it necessary to explicate or defend their philosophical
recourse to what transpires in the &ldquo;dirt and mess&rdquo; of
studio rehearsals, is understood collectively during polished stage
performances, and is articulated individually in critical notices.
David Davies (2009 and 2024), for example, urges that ontologies of
art should operate under a &ldquo;pragmatic constraint&rdquo; that
tethers abstract metaphysical claims to relevant features of the
artistic practice under consideration. Barbara Montero (2012, 2013,
and 2016) argues, instead, that there is strong empirical evidence to
support the idea that practitioners are <em>experts</em> in their
domains; hence, their specially informed perspectives should be given
due theoretical weight, if not pride of place.</p>

<p>
Other philosophers also argue that analytic dance aesthetics should be
more thoughtful about, and attentive to, actual danceworld practices.
Julie Van Camp has proposed</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that the identity of works of art [including dance] be understood
pragmatically as ways of talking and acting by the various communities
of the art world. (2006: 42)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Renee Conroy (2013b), by contrast, defends three &ldquo;minimal
desiderata&rdquo; for an adequate account of dancework identity, two
of which require that any metaphysical theory be responsive to the
complex socio-artistic matrix of the dance artworld. Despite their
differences, all four of these broadly analytic thinkers place a
premium on ensuring that philosophical treatments of dance remain
respectful of danceworld conventions, values, and norms.</p>

<p>
It should be noted, however, that this shared goal can be accomplished
in different ways and these approaches are not methodologically
equivalent. For some, commitment to the primacy of practice is a
<em>reflective</em> one that allows the results of good theory to be
revisionist with respect to our core beliefs about works of dance art
and, hence, to potentially alter some danceworld practices. For
others, philosophical treatment of dance should begin with danceworld
norms and customs and develop accounts that elucidate, or highlight
the complexities of, extant dance art practices while leaving the
beliefs and behaviors they support largely intact.</p>

<p>

philosophy, see Pakes 2020. For an account of dance practice as
research, see Pakes 2003 and 2017a. For more on dance expertise and
its relevance to philosophical theory, see Bresnahan 2017b and 2019a,

and Washburn et al. 2014.</p>

<h3 id="BodiResp">3.2 Bodily Responses</h3>

<p>
There is sustained controversy in dance philosophy about how to
construe the felt, bodily responses that audience members can
experience while watching a dance performance. These somatic reactions
are often called &ldquo;kinaesthetic&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;kinesthetic&rdquo;), combining the reference to movement in
&ldquo;kinetic&rdquo; with the sense of &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; often
associated with grace and beauty. Two central questions surrounding
kineasthesia are: (1) What is the causal process by which kinaesthetic
responses are generated? and (2) To what extent, if any, does this
process inform a proper understanding of dance qua art?</p>

<p>
With respect to the first question, it is generally acknowledged that
the causal processes that might explain kinaesthetic responses to
watching a live dance performance are not well understood. It is not
clear, for example, how &ldquo;empathy&rdquo;, taken in the broad
sense as the ability to feel something based on what we perceive to be
another person&rsquo;s physical or emotional state, plays a role in
viewers&rsquo; kinaesthetic reactions to what they witness at a dance
event.</p>

<p>
With regard to the second query, some contemporary philosophers of
dance (e.g., Montero 2006a, 2006b, 2012, and 2013) appeal to research
in cognitive and neuroscience to help explain <em>why</em> audience
members report having kineaesthetic experiences, such as a quickening
heart rate, a dropping stomach, and various muscular tensions, while
they watch dancers in action. Recent discussions also highlight the
relationship between felt bodily responses in audience members and
various uses of the imagination, drawing on Kendall Walton&rsquo;s
highly influential <em>Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of
the Representational Arts</em> (1990) (see Conroy 2020; cf. Heckman
2023). The scope of concern about kineasthesia and dance appreciation
has also been expanded to include analysis of the kinds of
&ldquo;frissons&rdquo;, or bodily thrills, a dance art performance
might be designed intentionally to inspire in audience members (Nanay
2023).</p>

<p>
Dance philosophers defend a range of views about the significance of
felt bodily responses to dance art appreciation. Some authors presume
they are important, but do not elucidate why or in what manner
kinaesthetics might contribute to engaging works of dance art aptly.
Others are &ldquo;appreciative optimists&rdquo; (here modifying D.
Davies 2013, see
 <a href="#DancCognScie">Section 4</a>)
 who argue that viewers&rsquo; bodily responses might be valuable, or
even necessary, for <em>identifying correctly</em> some of a dance
work&rsquo;s artistic properties, such as the gracefulness of an arm
movement or the beauty of an extended physical line (see Montero 2006a
and 2006b; cf. Seeley 2020). At the opposite end of the argumentive
spectrum are &ldquo;appreciative pessimists&rdquo; who deny that a
viewer&rsquo;s felt somatic reaction to a dance art performance can
ever be relevant to grasping the artistic features of the dance qua
artwork (see McFee 1992, 2011b, 2018).</p>

<p>
Those who occupy a middle position in this debate contend that while
bodily responses can bear on the appreciative understanding of a dance
art creation, and contribute to our regard for some of its
art-relevant features, kinaesthetic reactions do not register the
work&rsquo;s fine-grained artistic properties reliably (see Conroy
2013a and 2020). All of these positions are <em>conceptually
distinct</em> from those defended in the debate over the value of
utilizing scientific data and empirical studies as elements of dance
philosophy (see
 <a href="#DancCognScie">Section 4</a>).
 They do, nonetheless, tend to track optimism and pessimism about this
discrete methodological issue.</p>

<p>

Foster 2008 and 2011. For more on kinaesthetic responses to dance, see
Bresnahan 2017b; Montero 2021; Reason and Reynolds 2010; Sklar 2008;
and Smyth 1984.</p>

<h2 id="DancCognScie">4. Dance and Cognitive Science</h2>

<p>
The number of dance philosophers who appeal to scientific research to
advance understanding of the physical aspects of making and
appreciating dance art is large and growing. For example, Maxine
Sheets-Johnstone&rsquo;s extensive body of dance writing incorporates
so much content from the cognitive and other sciences that it would
require another entry to list all the relevant references (see this
entry&rsquo;s bibliography for &ldquo;Sheets-Johnstone&rdquo; as a
start). Several important lines of thought have, however, introduced
the topic of empirical research into on-going discussions of dance
philosophers who work within broadly analytic traditions.</p>

<p>
For example, Montero argues that proprioception (the innate capacity
that apprises persons of their bodily position in space) might be
construed as an aesthetic sense and appeals to scientific research on
mirror neurons to defend this view (Montero 2006a, 2006b, 2013, 2016,
and 2021). Carroll expands Montero&rsquo;s argumentative project to
consider how dance and music can work together to affect our
kinaesthetic responses (Carroll and Moore 2011) and to explore how
experimental results in neuroscience could bolster dance critic John
Martin&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;metakinetic transfer&rdquo; (Carroll
and Seeley 2013).</p>

<p>
As noted above, writers who support the use of empirical research on
kinaesthetic responses to dance also tend to hold that the felt bodily
resonances engendered by watching a live dance performance can be
relevant to <em>appreciation</em> of dance qua art. To this end,
Carroll and Seeley (2013) argue that one central feature of
understanding dance well is grasping the nature of the experience in
all its aspects, including both cognitive and kinaesthetic elements.
They maintain, therefore, that connecting common phenomenological
reports with robust scientific explanations of them can be elucidating
and is appropriate to generating comprehensive understanding of the
dance-appreciative experience. This can be called the
&ldquo;moderately optimistic (methodological) view&rdquo; (following
D. Davies 2013).</p>

<p>
By contrast, some philosophers adopt a stance that is
&ldquo;moderately pessimistic&rdquo; (D. Davies 2013). These thinkers
regard some questions central to dance aesthetics as simply
unanswerable by science. Normative issues such as, &ldquo;What counts
as <em>proper</em> appreciation of a work of art?&rdquo; are, they
argue, such that the tools utilized in empirical study fail to engage
them helpfully, if at all. Thus, the moderate methodological pessimist
maintains that, <em>if</em> empirical research is to be used by dance
philosophers and others with an interest in the performing arts, then
it must be applied very carefully to the right set of questions (D.
Davies 2011a, 2013, 2014, and 2024).</p>

<p>
Being only &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;, however, this kind of pessimist can
argue that philosophy ought not partition itself off entirely from
science and other disciplines that could inform our best overall
thinking about the world. We would do well, on this view, to follow
the Quinean injunction that philosophy should be cognizant of, and
responsive to, current science so we can assess how our philosophic
positions fit into our broader web of beliefs. A moderate pessimist
might also be sympathetic to the idea that, at a minimum, empirical
research can help us avoid false assumptions about the arts based on
simple empirical misunderstandings about human beings (Seeley
2011).</p>

<p>
An &ldquo;extreme (methodological) pessimist&rdquo;, by contrast, will
deny that causal or scientific explanations can ever be relevant to a
philosophical treatment of issues pertaining to dance as an artform
(see McFee 2011a, 2013b and 2018). One common argumentative defense of
this position emphasizes the fact that artistic appreciation happens
at the level of <em>a person who appreciates</em> under various
normative constraints, not at the level of neurobiology. While
optimists concede that kinaesthetic responses cannot alone generate a
full, artistically sensitive apprehension of dance, they do think
neurobiologic studies of them can contribute to our wider
understanding of human responses to perceived movement, including
dance art. Optimists and moderate pessimists, therefore, both maintain
that scientific data has some legitimate place in dance philosophy,
precisely the claim the extreme pessimist rejects.</p>

perceived via subconscious processes before they are fully cognized.

<h2 id="AddiDancPhilConn">5. Additional Dance and Philosophy Connections</h2>

<p>
The final section is spare because the reader is encouraged to seek
out interdisciplinary sources beyond those mentioned in this entry, to
look at the additional readings recommended at the end of each
section, and to do independent research on the variety of approaches
to thinking about dance that populate the pages of dance studies and
performance studies journals.</p>

<h3 id="NonWestNonTradPhilDanc">5.1 Non-Western and Non-Traditional Philosophy and Dance</h3>

<p>
Here the reader is invited to consult sources that may not be called
&ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; but something else, such as religious
studies, ethnography, cultural anthropology, and oral history,
particularly in traditions where philosophy and religious scholarship
is meshed (as in Islamic philosophy and some forms of East Asian and
Indian philosophy) or where the histories and values are communicated
orally rather than in writing (as is often the case in the philosophy
of native and indigenous peoples). There is also much of interest to
be found in the literature, poetry, and song of groups and peoples who
are not a traditionally enfranchised part of the Western philosophical
canon. And, in recent years, there is increasing discussion in
academic publications of both Western and non-Western vernacular or
social dance forms.</p>

<p>
The bibliographic sources provided on non-Western and non-traditional
philosophy and/or non-Western forms of dance include: S. Davies (2006,
2008, 2012, 2017, and 2021) on Balinese Legong; Fraleigh (2010 and
2015) on the Japanese form of dance known as Butoh (which also
addresses the question of whether Butoh is, itself, a form of
philosophy); Friedman (2021) on post-colonial African philosophical
frameworks as applied to dance; Hall (2012) on Fanon&rsquo;s view of
dance; Osumare (2007) on Africanist aesthetics and hip-hop; Schroeder
(2009) on Nietzsche and the Kyoto school; Welch (2019) on Native
American dance and the phenomenology of performative knowledge; and
Welsh-Asante (1990), who has published a piece on Cabral, Fanon and
dance in Africa. See also
 <a href="#DancEthiSociPoliPhil">Section 5.2</a>
 below, particularly for Western non-traditional philosophy, some of
which is critical work that has been placed under the social-political
category.</p>

<h3 id="DancEthiSociPoliPhil">5.2 Dance, Ethics and Social-Political Philosophy</h3>

<p>
Here the reader is invited to consult journals focused on ethics,
social and political philosophy, periodicals that highlight cultural
and critical studies (such as gender, race, disability, ethnicity,
LGBTQ+ and others), and writing in both dance studies and dance
history. For a subject-related entry that discusses the influence of
post-structuralism and politics on dance philosophy, see Pakes 2019b.
(Cf. Cull &Oacute; Maoilearca 2012 for a Deleuzean account of the
ethics of performance that might apply to dance.)</p>

<p>
Additional sources one might consult include the following: Fiona
Bannon&rsquo;s monograph (2018) on dance and ethics (which makes use
of Spinoza&rsquo;s and Martin Buber&rsquo;s moral theories); Karen
Bond&rsquo;s comprehensive and multifaceted book (2019), <em>Dance and
Quality of Life</em> (which addresses how dance contributes to what is
good for human beings); Bresnahan and Deckard (2019) and Hall (2018)
on disability and dance; DeFrantz&rsquo;s work on black dance and
aesthetics (2005, 2019, 2021); Eva Kit Wah Man&rsquo;s book (2019) on
bodies, aesthetics and politics in China (which is not specifically
about dance); Royona Mitra&rsquo;s work on Akram Khan&rsquo;s style of
dance and choreography as a form of inter-culturalism (2015 and 2018);
Melpignano (2023) on dance as a form of political expression; Eric
Mullis (2021) on dance and political power; Halifu Osumare&rsquo;s
memoir, <em>Dancing in Blackness</em> (2018), and its companion piece,
<em>Dancing the Afrofuture</em> (2024); and Sherman (2018) on dancers,
soldiers and emotional engagement. See also the three-part essay on
dance as embodied ethics in Bresnahan, Katan-Schmid, and Houston
(2020).</p>

<h3 id="DancFilmDigiTech">5.3 Dance, Film and Digital Technology</h3>

<p>
Dance made for social or artistic reasons includes more than real-time
bodily performances presented on the concert stage, in the streets, or
other live venues. There is a great variety of dancing designed to be
appreciated in digital, filmic or other technologically-mediated
formats, even excluding the recent explosion of dance on Tik-Tok. New
dance philosophy, as philosophy <em>of</em> these new dance arts, is
developing accordingly. Dancemakers have a long history of
enthusiastic experimentation with emerging technologies going back, at
least, to Lo&iuml;e Fuller in the late 19th century. Thus,
contemporary philosophical questions in this domain are complicated by
the unprecedented array of technologies now available to create
dances, and there is particular interest in issues surrounding dance
and AI.</p>

<p>
In this multi-faceted area of inquiry, it is important to mark a
distinction between Screendance (a hybrid art genre of dance and
film), dances made for screen (such as a sanctioned recording of a
performance designed to be viewed in movie theaters or on television),
and dance on screen (video traces of past live dance events). Current
philosophical debates emphasize questions such as: When we view a
dance performance through a mediated format, do we have genuine
commerce with the work of dance art? (D. Davies 2019 and 2021; McFee
2018) Are substantive aesthetic-artistic experiences, or opportunities
for meaningful kineasthetic engagement, compromised when we watch
dance on screen? (Berleant 2021; Heckman 2021) How does the use of
video recording or other digital tools to generate new works of dance
art, or create dance scores, affect our best accounts about what
<em>kind of things</em> dance works are? (Blades 2015b; Pakes
2020)</p>

<p>
In addition to considering the following resources, the reader is
encouraged to conduct dance philosophy research by watching film and
reading emerging technology journals. Dance philosophers who write on
dance and film include Brannigan 2014; Carroll 2001; McFee 2018; and
Salzer and Baer 2015. Hetty Blades (2015a and 2015b) has written
specifically on dance, virtual technology and scoring, and her work
addresses other forms of dance technology as well. For a piece on
dance, ethics and technology, see Mullis 2015. See also the extended
section on dance and technology in the <em>Bloomsbury Handbook to
Dance and Philosophy</em> (2021) edited by Rebecca Farinas and Julie
Van Camp, with consultation by Craig Hanks and Aili Bresnahan.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>As of the 2025 update, Renee Conroy has taken responsibility for
updating and maintaining this entry. In the
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2024/entries/dance/" target="other">earlier version of this entry</a>,
 an attempt was made to canvass some of the history of the philosophy
of dance as it existed and had developed in western philosophical
aesthetics. In that domain dance is treated as a meaning-making and
often communicative, expressive or representational theater or concert
art that is practiced and performed for audience appreciation. The
present version of the entry attempts to map out a broader terrain for
a larger and more inclusive philosophy of dance. But it is still
incomplete. This reflects, in part, limitations of space as well as
the fact that the much of dance philosophy exists in locations
disparate enough that often they are not (yet) in communication with
one another. (See Pakes 2019b for an excellent overview of the field
of philosophy of dance&mdash;it is our recommendation that this work
be treated as a companion piece to this entry.)</p>

<p>
To make room for this expanded account of the philosophy of dance,
earlier sections of this entry on the history of dance in Western
analytic aesthetics, comparisons with music and theater, on the
concepts of representation and expression, and on dance criticism have
been supplanted by new sections. Those readers who wish to review the
philosophical aesthetics history will find it in the
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2024/entries/dance/" target="other">earlier version of this entry</a>.
