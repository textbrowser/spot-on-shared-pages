<h1>Emmanuel Levinas</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Jul 23, 2006; substantive revision Mon Sep 29, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Emmanuel Levinas&rsquo; (1905&ndash;1995) intellectual project was to
develop a first philosophy. Whereas traditionally first philosophy
denoted either metaphysics or theology, only to be reconceived by
Heidegger as fundamental ontology, Levinas argued that it is ethics
that should be so conceived. But, rather than formulating an ethical
<em>theory</em>, Levinas developed his philosophy in opposition to
both metaphysics and ontology. It takes the form of a description and
interpretation of the event of encountering another
 person.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Giving rise to spontaneous acts of responsibility for others, the
encounter unfolds, according to Levinas, at a precognitive level,
thanks to what he called our embodied
 &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 That is why a phenomenology of intersubjective responsibility would
be &lsquo;first&rsquo; philosophy; viz., in the sense of
interpretively reconstructing a level of experience precursive to both
reflective activity and practical interests.</p>

<p>
Some commentators have called Levinas&rsquo; work an ethics of ethics,
others a meta-ethics, while still others have urged that his thought
can accommodate many ethical theories, from intuitionism to
rationalism (see <em>infra</em>). However that may be, his work is in
ongoing, critical dialogue with three philosophers: Husserl,
Heidegger, and Hegel. Given these targets&mdash;as well as
philosophical interlocutors like Merleau-Ponty&mdash;Levinas&rsquo;
philosophy begins from an enlarged conception of lived embodiment and
a powerful extension of Husserl&rsquo;s technique of suspending
conceptualization to reveal experience as it comes to light. He is
also indebted to Heidegger for his hermeneutics of
being-in-the-world.</p>

<h2 id="TheExpLevPhi">2. Thematic Exposition of Levinas&rsquo; Philosophy</h2>

<p>
This entry will follow Levinas&rsquo; career chronologically, as his
concepts evolve. In what follows, we will emphasize the following
arguments and themes: (1) why Levinas&rsquo; is a unique first
philosophy; (2) how he developed his investigation of the lived
conditions of possibility of our concern with ethical reasoning; and
(3) the originality of his adaptation of phenomenology and his
existentialist hermeneutics of pre-intentional embodied
intersubjectivity. A leitmotif of this entry is the notion of
transcendence, in Levinas, as we will explain. We will pay attention
throughout to the contribution of commentators, with a view to
providing a gateway to recent secondary literature.</p>

<h3 id="PhiBegEsc193TraNeeEsc">2.1 Philosophical Beginnings: <em>On Escape</em> (1935) or Transcendence as the Need to Escape</h3>

<p>
Levinas published his thesis, <em>The Theory of Intuition in
Husserl&rsquo;s Phenomenology</em>, in 1930. It was the first
book-length introduction to Edmund Husserl&rsquo;s thought in French.
By focusing on the theme of intuition, Levinas established what
philosophical readers find notably in Husserl&rsquo;s <em>Ideas</em> I
and II/III (published in 1913 and, for <em>Ideas</em> II/III,
partially in 1930, and in different editions in 1952 and 2025): every
human experience is open to phenomenological description; every human
experience carries meaning from the outset and can be examined as a
mode of intentionality (<em>Ideas</em> II, &sect;56 h and
&sect;&sect;57&ndash;61). The following year, he published his
co-translation of Husserl&rsquo;s <em>Cartesian Meditations</em>, in
which Husserl had laid out a systematic presentation of transcendental
phenomenology. In the 1930s, Levinas continued to publish studies of
the thought of his two principal teachers, Husserl and Martin
Heidegger. These included the essays &ldquo;Martin Heidegger and
Ontology&rdquo; (1932, EDE 53&ndash;76) and the extensive &ldquo;The
Work of Edmund Husserl&rdquo; (1940, DEH 47&ndash;89). In the 1930s
and 1940s, his philosophical project was influenced by Husserl&rsquo;s
phenomenological <em>method</em>, whose foundation arguably lay in the
centrality of the &ldquo;transcendental ego&rdquo; (<em>Ideas</em> I
&sect;49). However, suspicious of the intellectualism of
Husserl&rsquo;s approach to essences (called phenomenological
&ldquo;eidetics&rdquo;), Levinas gravitated toward Heidegger&rsquo;s
more worldly approach to existence in <em>Being and
 Time</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Between 1930 and 1935, he will nevertheless turn away from
Heidegger&rsquo;s approach to being and transcendence, and develop the
outlines of a distinct ontology. As we shall see, he will reconceive
transcendence as a need for escape from existence, and work out a
different analysis of lived time in <em>On Escape</em> (1935).</p>

<p>
Levinas&rsquo; first original essay, <em>De
l&rsquo;&eacute;vasion</em>, examined the relationship between the
embodied (sentient) self and the intentional
 ego<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 from the perspectives of physical and affective states including
need, pleasure, shame, and nausea. In this succinct philosophical
work, Levinas was less concerned than was Heidegger with the question
of existence as it opens up before us when we experience the
dissolving of things in the world in anxiety (BT
 &sect;40).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Levinas&rsquo; question was not: &ldquo;Why is there being instead of
simply nothing?&rdquo; His concern was to approach existence
differently, through the human being as Heidegger had also done, but
in light of more embodied experiences like the above-mentioned ones
(OE &sect;6). Enlarging Heidegger&rsquo;s hermeneutics of
being-in-the-world, Levinas gave priority to lived moods and physical
states that revealed existence as oppressive and indeterminate.
Indeed, in escapism and its various aesthetic expressions, we discover
humans&rsquo; failed attempts to get away from the being that they
themselves are. &ldquo;Escape&rdquo;, he wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is the need to get out of oneself, that is, to break that most radical
and unalterably binding of chains, the fact that the I [<em lang="fr">moi</em>]
is oneself [<em lang="fr">soi-m&ecirc;me</em>].
(OE &sect;1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the two imbricated dimensions of human life, sentient-affective and
intentional, our experience of being comes to pass in the relationship
between body and egoic consciousness.</p>

<p>
Levinas&rsquo; youthful project approached transcendence secularly, in
light of humans&rsquo; irreducible urge to get past the limits of
their physical and social circumstances. His transcendence is less a
question of cognition reaching reality or humans seeking to pass
&lsquo;beyond&rsquo; themselves (respectively BT &sect;&sect;43, 10)
than transcendence, attempted through sensuous evasions. This approach
to transcendence is nevertheless motivated by the question of our
mortality and finite being, but unlike Heidegger, it also examines the
enigma called infinity.</p>

<p>
Levinas thus accepted Heidegger&rsquo;s arguments that a human being
experiences itself as if thrown into its world (BT &sect;38), without
cognitive mastery over its birth and death. Heidegger&rsquo;s human
being, or <em lang="de">Da-sein</em> (being-there), lives out its time
projecting itself toward its diverse possibilities. It flees its
uncanny thrownness by distracting itself in social pursuits, a
position that Levinas will not adopt. On the other hand, the
projective element of transcendence, which Heidegger described in
<em>The Basic Problems of Phenomenology</em> (1927
 [1982])<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 as merely a &ldquo;stepping over to&hellip;as such&rdquo;, was of
great interest to Levinas. But he would enquire: to what and from what
are we &lsquo;stepping over&rsquo;? Levinas then observed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[M]odern sensibility wrestles with problems that indicate&hellip;the
abandonment of this concern with transcendence. As if it had the
certainty that the idea of the <em>limit</em> could not apply to the
<em>existence</em> of what is&hellip;and as if modern sensibility
perceived in <em>being</em> a defect still more profound. (OE &sect;1,
emph. added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
His argument here concerns a conceit of our &lsquo;modern&rsquo;
sensibility (and philosophy); namely, that we presume we could
thoughtfully frame a better conception of being, wherein existence was
in some sense self-sufficient. What Levinas calls the
&ldquo;insufficiency of the human condition&rdquo; (OE &sect;1) simply
denotes the limitation of our existence, whose transcendence, when
understood as escape, promises that we might somehow surpass it, as if
through an infinite experience. When transcendence is removed from
theological or metaphysical frameworks (i.e., secularized as
Heidegger&rsquo;s &ldquo;stepping over&rdquo;), then we grasp it in
its historical context-dependency, as the illusions of a finite being
pondering pure self-sufficiency. Reconceived in this way, the entire
question of transcendence changes, revealing the struggle to get out
of our all too finite existence. That is why Levinas asks: &ldquo;[Is]
the need for escape not the exclusive matter of a finite
being?&hellip;Would an infinite being have the need to take leave of
itself&rdquo; (OE &sect;2)? In short, is our first response to
mortality not the urge to take leave of our existence, if
periodically? This question is not so different from Heidegger&rsquo;s
conception of inauthenticity. But unlike Heidegger, true authenticity
does not lie in securing our freedom for our most personal
possibility, death. Levinas argued that we can approach death as
possibility only through that of others and that we grasp being as
finite by way of their mortality. On the other hand, when secularized,
the idea of infinity refers to something absolute in human
consciousness (OE &sect;1), which motivates our repeated efforts at
escaping ourselves into various ecstasies. This is clearly a
conception of being that is different from Heidegger&rsquo;s. Later,
of course, Levinas will attribute infinity to a different experience,
that of the unbounded quality of the face of the other. However,
intersubjective relationality is little discussed in the 1935 essay.
The encounter with the other first comes into view as a theme in his
1940s works (TO and EE). Significant here, nevertheless, are the
following two points: (1) Levinas&rsquo; argument that
Heidegger&rsquo;s conception of existence is specific to a history,
that of German thought and that of hermeneutics; (2) to be an embodied
psyche is to struggle with the limits of one&rsquo;s facticity or
existential situation, and it is there that the question of being as
<em>our</em> existence initially arises.</p>

<p>
Heidegger&rsquo;s <em lang="de">Da-sein</em> confronted the question
of being when it found itself brought before itself in anxiety (BT
&sect;40). In contrast, Levinas proposed other ways by which the gap
narrows between being itself and the beings that we are. Following his
<em>leitmotif</em> of our recurrent urge to escape, Levinas examined
the invariable disappointments following our attempts at transcending
our existence: the aforementioned states of need and pleasure give way
to a sobering up or disillusionment. In affective and physical states
like shame and nausea, the bodily self is experienced as a substance
trapped in its stifling existence and desperate for a way out.
Commentator Jacques Rolland has explored Levinas&rsquo; return to the
body, to concreteness, to the desire for escape, and the way in which
he criticized Heidegger&rsquo;s hermeneutics (OE 29&ndash;32). Rolland
adds that this approach was inspired by Levinas&rsquo; critical
meditation, published one year earlier (1934), on the &ldquo;blood and
soil&rdquo; philosophy popular with National Socialism (RPH). As
regards stifling existence, when Levinas refers to being, it is as
ongoing presence, rather than the event of disclosure that Heidegger
described. It remains a matter of debate whether this interpretation
of being constitutes a step back to an older metaphysics, prior to
Heidegger&rsquo;s innovations, or not (Franck 2008: 31).</p>

<p>
Whether we choose to take Levinas&rsquo; approach to being as
criticizing Heidegger&rsquo;s conception of our existence or as
inspired by him, commentators often underscore its fresh empiricism.
Megan Craig compares the early works of Levinas with the
&ldquo;radical empiricism&rdquo; of William James (2010: xv). Lisa
Guenther, in turn, has examined embodiment and the experience of
maternity in the later Levinas (2006: 119&ndash;136, see &sect;3.4.5).
From the outset, the &ldquo;fact of existing&rdquo; refers to some
philosophically unexplored phenomena of our embodiment, our
aforementioned I-self (<em>moi-soi</em>) duality.</p>

<p>
Polemically, Levinas urged that the most extreme state he described,
nausea, amounts to being-there, what Husserl&rsquo;s phenomenology
called &ldquo;self-positing&rdquo;: &ldquo;&hellip;nausea posits
itself not only as something absolute, but as the very act of
self-positing: it is the affirmation itself of being&rdquo; (OE
&sect;6). Other forms of self-positing occur, of course, as this event
refers to the experience of unity between the lived corporeal self and
the formal ego of intentions. In a somewhat different vein, Raoul
Moati will speak of the &ldquo;first-&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;third-person&rdquo; perspectives (2012 [2017: 38&ndash;71]).
Thus, in immediate experience, I <em>am</em> my joy or my pain,
provisionally, just as I may observe myself joyful, like a third
person. Nevertheless, our various efforts to get out of our concrete
situations are not the same as what Heidegger deemed projections
toward new possibilities, wherein our death lies at the end of all the
others, as the ultimate limit, or &ldquo;possibility of
impossibility&rdquo; (BT &sect;50). For Levinas, by contrast, escape
represents a positive, dynamic need. In this youthful work, he also
rethinks need as fullness rather than as mere privation. As we
indicated, he is working toward a different understanding of existence
itself. Whether it is characterized by pleasure or suffering, need is
the very ground of that existence. A secular transcendence responds to
need, promising a path toward &ldquo;something other than
ourselves&rdquo; (OE &sect;3), which is why the deep motivation of
need is to get out of our finite condition. Already by 1935,
Levinas&rsquo; ontology has displaced Heidegger&rsquo;s being in light
of the dynamic relation between the sentient self and the intentional
&lsquo;I&rsquo;; it has refocused attention on the present over
Heidegger&rsquo;s emphasis on the future and explored new modes by
which we experience the being that we are.</p>

<p>
In this youthful essay, Levinas discusses three important themes
critical for Heidegger: If being is disclosed only through the being
that we are as humans (<em lang="de">Da-sein</em>), then any human
being that ongoingly strives to escape itself, because it feels
trapped in its own daily life, can be called a &ldquo;creature&rdquo;
that carries &ldquo;the stigmatum of [finite] existence&rdquo; (OE
&sect;8). Second, nausea is not simply a physiological scourge,
according to Levinas. It shows us dramatically how being can encircle
us on all sides, to the point of submerging us. Social and political
life, themselves, may thereby nauseate us, as Rolland observes. Third,
if being or existence is experienced in its pure form as heavy
indeterminacy, then we can neither bypass it (as expressed in the
&ldquo;aspirations of Idealism&rdquo; [OE &sect;8]) nor merely
accepted like passive subjects. Being is existence, but it is firstly
<em>our</em> existence. The mark of creaturely existence is need and,
by extension, a struggle with being. The crucial question that remains
is how we can best think through our sensuous need to transcend being.
Embodied need is not an illusion, as we have seen. Is transcendence an
illusion? Levinas answers this question more fully in <em>Totality and
Infinity</em> (1961).</p>

<h3 id="MidWriExiExi194TimOth194InfTraVarBei">2.2 Middle Writings: Existence and Existents (1947) and Time and the Other (1947) or Inflections of Transcendence and Variations on Being</h3>

<p>
The 1940s writings extend Levinas&rsquo; innovations in ontology,
always with recourse to interpretations of embodiment and against
Heidegger&rsquo;s philosophy of existence which, for Levinas, entails
engagement with being as &ldquo;participation&rdquo; without
 alterity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 These writings inflect his notion of transcendence, away from the
imagined transcendence of evasion and pleasure, toward <em lang="grc">eros</em>
and the promise of the birth of a
 child.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 This requires that he explore alterity, understood here as the
feminine other (EE 86).</p>

<p>
In <em>Existence and Existents</em> (1947) and <em>Time and the
Other</em> (1947), being now has a dual aspect, of light and of dark
indeterminacy. It is as though being were divided between the being of
a created world and the darkness out of which light was
 brought.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 This shifts phenomenological focus onto being as light and
visibility, wherein we constitute objects, and being as the dark
turmoil that we experience in insomnia. Levinas&rsquo; attempt to
expand the sense of the embodied <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>, and to
reconceive the distinction between being and <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>
(existence and the perceptual open that we are)
has also changed. Following Husserl&rsquo;s transcendental
phenomenology, in which a multi-layered &ldquo;I&rdquo; directs
intentional focus like a center from which our attention radiates,
Levinas&rsquo; embodied ego is neither preceded nor outstripped by its
world. The corporeal self [<em lang="fr">soi</em>], henceforth called
the &ldquo;hypostasis&rdquo;, is its own ground; i.e., we awaken out
of ourselves, into light; we proceed with our projects (EE
61&ndash;86; TO 51&ndash;55). We fall asleep, curled about ourselves,
thereby exiting our conscious existence. Embodied consciousness thus
begins and ends with itself. As such, it is both dependent on and
independent from its environment, and Levinas will urge that the
subject, upon awakening, uses and masters being.</p>

<p>
In the middle period essays, the partial transcendences of pleasure
and desire, already sketched in 1935, receive fuller development and
variations. The meaning of transcendence focuses on a new temporality
promised by desire and &ldquo;fecundity&rdquo;, or the birth of the
son (EE 100; TO 91&ndash;92). The son incarnates alterity in a curious
way. He is, in a sense, his father and <em>not</em> his father.
However, his birth opens a different focus on the future. No longer
conceived as one of open possibilities, as Heidegger had argued, the
time opened by the son responds to two basic limitations on our
understanding and representation: death and the other person. While
not denying Heidegger&rsquo;s intuition about death as the
&ldquo;possibility of impossibility&rdquo;, Levinas repeats his
earlier argument that we witness death only in the death of the other.
But even as such, it escapes everyday understanding. Hence, Levinas
will qualify death as an alterity as radical as that of the other
human being who confronts me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In death the existing of the existent is alienated. To be sure, the
other that is announced does not possess this existing as the subject
possesses it; its hold over my existing is mysterious. It is not
unknown but unknowable. (TO 75)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, we can and do constitute the other as an <em>alter
ego</em>. Yet such constitution by phenomenological apperception never
exhausts his fundamental difference (TO 78&ndash;79). In so arguing,
Levinas proposes to enlarge Husserl&rsquo;s &ldquo;other&rdquo;, of
whom the latter said that he or she is &ldquo;an <em>analogon</em> of
myself, [yet also] <em>not</em> an <em>analogon</em> in the habitual
sense&rdquo; (CM &sect;44).</p>

<p>
Two reversals should be noted, here, relative to 1935. First, against
Hegel&rsquo;s conception of work as the dialectic of spirit
transforming nature, Levinas describes labor phenomenologically as
effort and
 fatigue,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 again highlighting his distinction between the embodied, working self
and the cognitive ego. The second reversal concerns moods themselves.
In Heidegger, anxiety, joy, and boredom were states of mind, with
anxiety as the privileged mood by which humans are confronted with
themselves, their lack of ground, and with the question of their
existence. In his middle period, Levinas will expand the experience of
being to moods now including horror. Nighttime being reveals an
indeterminate dark presence that is not pure nothing. &ldquo;The
horror of the night, as an experience of the there-is, does not then
reveal to us a danger of death, nor even a danger of pain&rdquo; (EE
57). Therefore pure being can never be just Heidegger&rsquo;s lighted
clearing. And our existence in the world requires stronger embodiment
than an eye and a hand that reaches to grasp objects
&ldquo;ready-to-hand&rdquo; (Heidegger). Once again, Levinas recurs to
bodily states, this time including fatigue, indolence, insomnia, and
awakening. In the first three, the aforementioned gap between the
embodied self and the intentional I increases. Upon awakening, the
embodied ego (<em lang="fr">soi-moi</em>) reasserts its mastery over
things and even its own bodily torpor. But for Levinas being in the
world is less a matter of utility and Heidegger&rsquo;s phenomenon of
&ldquo;falling&rdquo; into distraction, than one of love of life and
sheer enjoyment (BT
 179).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 This, too, is part of Levinas&rsquo; critique of Heidegger, for whom
our concern for the world often coexists with instrumentalist
relationships with things. In search of variations on being as a call
or as revelation, and in privileging the basic subjectivity (or
&ldquo;hypostasis&rdquo;) capable of raising itself above being (now
understood as the neutral &ldquo;there is&rdquo;), Levinas is <em>en
route</em> to his secular philosophy of alterity and transcendence.

<h3 id="TreHosTotInf196ResTraJus">2.3 The &ldquo;Treatise on Hospitality&rdquo;: Totality and Infinity (1961) or Responsibility, Transcendence, and Justice</h3>

<p>
<em>Totality and Infinity</em> was written as Levinas&rsquo;
<em>Doctorat
 d&rsquo;&Eacute;tat</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 His concept of transcendence provides us a useful point of departure
for reading <em>Totality and Infinity</em>. That is, so long as we
consider his debt to Husserl&rsquo;s phenomenology. Husserl understood
transcendence in several ways, of which one dimension was that typical
of consciousness extending toward and encountering the worldly objects
(noema) that offer themselves to it. After Husserl, Heidegger will
define transcendence as the essence of our existing in the world. <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>
is always already in the world among things,
according to a worldly transcendence or being out-there. Jean-Paul
Sartre followed Heidegger in this, urging that &ldquo;transcendence is
a constitutive structure of consciousness&rdquo; (EN 1943 [1992: 23]),
and his concept of consciousness is similarly in the world and
ingredient in our actions.</p>

<p>
For Levinas, these senses of transcendence are acceptable but not
primary. Instead, he aligns transcendence with exteriority, in the
sense of what lies outside myself but eludes my comprehensive
knowledge: the other person (TI
 49).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 The encounter with the other is an encounter with a visible thing, of
course. But <em>this</em> other speaks to me, implores or commands me.
In responding, I discover my responsibility to them. This is the
ground of ethics or indeed our concern with ethics as the good of the
other person.</p>

<p>
As Levinas argues, when ethics goes in search of its existential
ground, before any consideration of utility, virtue, or duty, it
discovers the relational enactment of responsibility, which resists
being integrated into accounts in which the other is a universal
<em>other</em> to whom it is my duty, for example, to act ethically,
or in the hope of increasing the happiness of the collectivity (Kant).
To be sure, utility, virtue, and duty are crucial to ethical debates.
Yet Levinas is pointing to their common <em>lived</em> origin in the
irreducibility of the face-to-face encounter. <em>For a further
discussion, see
 <a href="supplements.html#SupLevConEth">Supplement S.2 on Levinas and Contemporary Ethics</a></em>.</p>
 
<h4 id="StrWor">2.3.1 Structure of the Work</h4>

<p>
<em>Totality and Infinity</em> unfolds around phenomenological
descriptions of being, depicted initially as nature or forces in
conflict (TI 21&ndash;22). However, our being in-the-world also
entails the enjoyment of natural elements and love of life (TI
110&ndash;115).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We live from &lsquo;good soup&rsquo;, air, light, spectacles, work,
ideas, sleep, etc&hellip;.These are not objects of representations. We
live from them. (TI 110)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Levinas also reframes labor as the creation of a store of goods thanks
to which the other can be welcomed (TI 157&ndash;161, 205), rather
than solely as the mastery or humanization of nature. Because we take
joy in living and in creating a home, our existence in the world
entails dimensions other than Heidegger&rsquo;s &ldquo;thrown
potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world&rdquo;, which is based on
Da-sein&rsquo;s being abandoned to itself (BT 236). Consequently, our
lives do not consist in an isolated facticity, as Heidegger had
ventured.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Life is not the naked will to be, an ontological <em>Sorge</em> [care]
for this life. Life&rsquo;s relation with the very conditions of its
life becomes the nourishment and content of that life. (TI 112)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In being thus nourished, we can receive the other into our space.</p>

<p>
On the basis of these descriptions, transcendence as defined above
comes to pass in several stages. First, the onset of the
other&mdash;as the expression of the face&mdash;interrupts our free
activity (and willing) and calls us to account for ourselves (TI 198,
291), something Levinas calls &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; (TI
 200).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 Second, in responding, the subject approached by the other engages in
an act that opens the possibility of dialogue. The unfolding of
dialogue expands the social relationship, and Levinas argues that
social life preserves a residue of the initial &ldquo;ethical&rdquo;
encounter with the face. Intersubjective dialogue entails
conversation, teaching, and at a more general level, literary or
philosophical speech (TI 51, 57, 251&ndash;52, 295). As we will see,
this is a dimension of human sociality that often goes unexplored in
phenomenologies of intersubjectivity.</p>

<p>
Over the course of the expansion of dialogue, the trace of
responsibility is attenuated, and conundrums arise concerning the
well-being of other<em>s</em> and conflicts within the
<em>community</em>. These require deliberation about justice and
fairness. For instance: what does justice for the other(s) mean?
Should it above all concern the reparation of wrongs? Can
responsibility for an other coexist with disinterested equity within
the community? Or is justice in service to the stronger and ultimately
opposed to responsibility? Now, because it can clearly be interpreted
as all of these things, justice sometimes appears as intermediary
between Levinas&rsquo; aforementioned ontology of worldly forces in
conflict (or elementary being) and our acts of responsibility. This
would tally with Aristotle&rsquo;s two conceptions of justice, first
as political and second, as unbidden &lsquo;decency&rsquo;,
<em>t&ograve; epiekes</em>, meaning to accept receiving less than
one&rsquo;s share. Aristotle himself defined the combination of the
two as <em>complete</em> virtue (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> 1130a,
119 and
 1137b7&ndash;11).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 There would thus be an interesting precedent to Levinas&rsquo;
question of the relationship between responsibility and justice in
Aristotle&rsquo;s virtue ethics.</p>

<p>
Levinas&rsquo; argument in <em>Totality and Infinity</em> unfolds up
to the question of justice and then takes an unanticipated tack.
Rather than pursuing justice as it is refined through civil society
into the State, Levinas focuses on a smaller-scale institution,: the
family, which is arguably common to all humanity. It is presumably in
the family rather than in the State that the responsibility described
in the face-to-face encounter is most clearly enacted. If the family
is consolidated by the birth of the child, then, as Levinas puts it,
it is the father who elects and calls the child to responsibility,
just as the child grows up serving his siblings in a way more personal
than that prescribed by the impersonal justice of States. According to
Levinas, <em>this</em> familial justice carries a specific temporal
modalization: &ldquo;The unique child, as elected one, is accordingly
at the same time unique and non-unique. Paternity is produced as an
innumerable future&rdquo;, as open posterity (TI 279). In this
penultimate section entitled &ldquo;Beyond the Face&rdquo;, the
phenomenology of the family thus expands the responsibility
experienced in the face-to-face into a micro-society, in which
questions of justice may arise, but with a new emphasis on future
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="TimTraSoc">2.3.2 Time, Transcendence, and Sociality</h4>

<p>
<em>Totality and Infinity</em> does not devote attention to clock time
or to the time of universal history, in Hegel&rsquo;s sense notably.
Because Levinas begins his analyses with the concept of being as
virtually aligned with material causality and strife, the experience
of &lsquo;subjective&rsquo; time as the interruption that occurs in
the encounter with the face is not yet social time. History, too,
seems to be a metaphysician&rsquo;s history. In his
&ldquo;Preface&rdquo;, Levinas describes history as violence,
punctuated by extremes of war and temporary peace (TI 21&ndash;23).
Morgan has argued that this makes Levinas&rsquo; approach to ethical
intersubjectivity anti-naturalistic, at least to the degree that
naturalism is tied to a Hobbesian mechanistic ontology (2011: 246).
Levinas would be the last, however, to deny the self-interest of our
drives and instincts. To the contrary, only an intersubjectivity
inaugurated by the other&rsquo;s summons interrupts these behaviors
(Morgan 2011: 246). Yet Levinas also envisions an alternative history
in which it is possible to bear witness to wrongs undergone by
persons. These wrongs may not be recorded in the official history of
governments. But their attestation prolongs his discussion of human
sensibility as invested by responsibility. Levinas writes,
&ldquo;[h]istory is worked over by the ruptures of history, in which a
judgment is borne upon it. When man truly approaches the Other he is
uprooted from history&rdquo; (TI 52).</p>

<p>
Levinas&rsquo; phenomenological account of time contains three levels:
an initial one equivalent to formal historicist time, a second level
comparable to Husserl&rsquo;s universal flow of immanent
 time-consciousness,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 and a third temporality that is episodic and affectively colored,
which he calls an interruption.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[The] discontinuity of the inner life interrupts historical time
[notably in the face-to-face encounter]. The thesis of the primacy of
history constitutes an option for the comprehension of being in which
interiority is sacrificed. The present work proposes another option.
(TI 57)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The aforementioned interruption of our immanent consciousness, qua
time-flow, by the other, a rupture that Levinas says characterizes our
&ldquo;inner life&rdquo;, is aligned with the experience of
transcendence.</p>

<p>
Unlike Heidegger, who explained the subject in terms of <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>&mdash;itself
an ongoing transcendence toward
the world in which <em lang="de">Da-sein</em> &ldquo;comes toward
itself futurally&rdquo; (BT
 &sect;69)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 in facing the possibility of its death&mdash;Levinas situates his
very concrete transcendence in the <em>interruption</em> of the first
two temporal levels. Indeed, whereas Heidegger gradually translated
his conception of the silent call of being (in and to <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>)
into the notion of the event (<em lang="de">Ereignis</em>)
in the 1930s, Levinas makes <em>his</em>
interruption-event an intersubjective affair or rather, the basis of
ethical relationality. For him, the encounter with the other is
<em>not</em> an ontological event in Heidegger&rsquo;s sense. Neither
is it like an occurrence that breaks up the historical <em>status
quo</em>, modifying the course of history into a &lsquo;before&rsquo;
and &lsquo;after&rsquo;, in function of its magnitude. Nevertheless,
Levinas does argue that the encounter with alterity <em>may</em> leave
a trace in historical
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Now, because the interruption brings to light a basic personal
responsibility for an other, a host of responses are possible <em>post
facto</em>, from welcoming that other with hospitality to attempting
to get him out of our way. Be that as it may, a trace of the
interruption persists in the subject, like a grain of sand in an
oyster or a preconscious motivation to bear witness to the
other&rsquo;s suffering. Jill Stauffer has recovered some of these
&lsquo;traces&rsquo; in her research on the testimonies of those
deprived of human rights (2015: 40&ndash;43, 56&ndash;58, 61&ndash;64,
91 <em>inter alia</em>). Fran&ccedil;ois-David Sebbah recalls that a
memorial trace persists in my experience along with the hope or dream
that somewhere I will find &ldquo;other people who may not hear me for
the time being, but whom I might hope to rejoin&rdquo;&mdash;this is
his version of the ambiguity of hope in the midst of desolation
(Sebbah 2018a: 29).</p>

<p>
Flowing out of the temporal interruptions that leave affective
mnemonic traces in persons, the ground of social existence in Levinas
does not resemble the solipsism for which Heidegger was criticized.
Our life with others is never akin to Heidegger&rsquo;s
&ldquo;inauthenticity&rdquo;, that flight from what should be the
resolute assumption of our mortality, nor even to moments disappearing
in a teleology of expanding socio-political collectivities that
culminate in the State (Hegel; sometimes Husserl, see Husserl 1973c:
no. 23, 387&ndash;395). As individuals, we are always in social
relations, marked by a remainder of responsibility. We have already
been impacted by the expression (or &ldquo;face&rdquo;) of an
other.</p>

<p>
Yet, because the immediacy of this impact resists conceptualization,
we tend to overlook the force that the other&rsquo;s address has on us
(as facial expression or words addressed). We carry on, in our
respective spheres, apparently motivated by desires and projects, some
of which entail the kind of quests for mastery and recognition that
Hegel described. In <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, nevertheless,
these quests are as if undercut by &ldquo;metaphysical desire&rdquo;
(TI 33&ndash;34, 114, 148ff.), which Levinas defines as &ldquo;a
desire [for the other] that cannot be satisfied&rdquo;. As he
explains, &ldquo;we speak lightly of desires satisfied, or of sexual
needs, or even of moral and religious needs&rdquo; (TI 34). However,
metaphysical desire &ldquo;desires beyond everything that can simply
complete it. It is like goodness&mdash;the Desired does not fulfill
it, but deepens it&rdquo; (TI 34). This under-layer of our everyday
desires comes to light in the faltering of our will to mastery as
experienced in the face-to-face encounter. The other&rsquo;s facial
expression or bodily posture affects me before I begin to reflect on
it. As indicated, the impact is dual: a command and a summons. Naked
and defenseless, the face signifies, with or without words, &ldquo;Do
not kill me&rdquo;. It opposes a passive resistance to our desire for
mastery wherein our freedom asserts its sovereignty (TI 84). Levinas
speaks of the face of the other who is &ldquo;widow, orphan, or
stranger&rdquo;. While these are Biblical figures, he argues that we
encounter them concretely even before transcribing them into religious
allegory (TI 76&ndash;78). They invest our freedom as the possibility
of giving.</p>

<p>
It is as summons and injunction that expression precipitates
transcendence. If I am self-sufficient in my everyday activities and
perception, then this is because I am a being that inhabits
overlapping worlds in which my sway is decisive for me. The passive
resistance of the face alters this sway through an affective mood not
unlike one Levinas had explored in <em>On Escape</em> (1935):
shame. In shame, we experience our freedom as unjustifiable. In thus
being lifted out of its concerns, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; offers an
account to the other, who is thereby treated as if higher than that
&ldquo;I&rdquo;, when considered in its personal sovereignty. For that
reason as well, the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, singled out and addressed by the
other, is chosen or &ldquo;elected&rdquo; to respond (TI
245&ndash;246, 279). It &ldquo;transascends&rdquo; (TI 35, 41) or
rises to the other, answering &ldquo;here I am&rdquo; (EI 106). As
indicated, Levinas argues that this instant of &ldquo;election&rdquo;
belongs to a temporal order different from that of everyday existence:
it is the moment of enactment of a &ldquo;good beyond Being&rdquo; (TI
80, 102&ndash;104, 292&ndash;293).</p>

<p>
It is impossible to set up a simple temporal order of succession or
alternation between being and the good beyond being. For humans, the
good comes to pass almost trivially and in everyday contexts. Of
course, as readily as responsibility and generosity may be glimpsed in
human affairs, cruelty and competition are also obvious. Given this,
Levinas seeks support for his intuition about the good in at least two
moments in the philosophical tradition, wherein its occurrence and
irreducible value have been identified: Plato&rsquo;s Idea of the
good, and Descartes&rsquo; infinite substance, which points beyond
itself to an unknowable cause. However, <em>that</em> humans
experience moments of inexplicable generosity, even enact them
spontaneously, is a fact that would remain enigmatic within an
ontology of competing drives or merely utilitarian desires. In that
respect, the trace of the good is present within existence as the
possibility that something other than rivalries and
instrumentalization take place intersubjectively.</p>

<p>
As Levinas understands it, transcendence has the non-metaphysical
characteristic of an interruption, a relation <em>in nuce</em>, and
what he now calls &ldquo;infinity&rdquo;. Insofar as infinity denotes
what is non-limited, uncircumscribable, it refers to the unpredictable
quality of a face&rsquo;s expression (TI 5). As he writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]o think the infinite, the transcendent, the Stranger, is hence not
to think an object. But to think what does not have the outlines of an
object is in reality to do more or better than think. (TI 49)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So far as infinity has a positive sense, then, it has that sense as
our unquenchable desire for sociality. Thus, before we interpret it as
&ldquo;God&rdquo; or reify it as a <em>summum ens</em>, the idea of
infinity is rooted in an everyday encounter whose implications are
clearest at the sensuous-affective level, and even somewhat resemble
Husserl&rsquo;s explorations of spontaneous empathy (<em lang="de">Einf&uuml;hlung</em>
as expanded in the 1920s notes on
intersubjectivity [<em>Husserliana</em>, Vols. 13&ndash;15]). Rather
than Husserl, however, Levinas refers to the French phenomenologist
Maurice Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s conception of lived intersubjective
flesh, urging that this corporeal intertwinement is part of our
&ldquo;fundamental
 historicity&rdquo;,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 that is, part of the sedimented experiences that contribute to our
grasp of new situations. Sebbah also emphasizes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the ethical imperative to respond to the command (the trial of the
other person) in no way arises from a psychological process of
<em>empathy</em> or of <em>sympathy</em>. (2018b, 49)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, in 1961, intersubjective sensibility is the locus of
transcendence outside psychological considerations.</p>

<p>
In the fourteen years separating <em>Existence and Existents</em> and
<em>Time and the Other</em> from <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, we
see both continuities and differences. If Heidegger had begun what he
conceived to be a hermeneutic dismantling of Husserl&rsquo;s
phenomenological consciousness, seeking what &ldquo;lies hidden&rdquo;
beneath phenomena (BT &sect;7c), then Levinas extended this
deformalizing gesture already in 1947, arguing that light itself is
incipient meaning, suspending the opposition between the <em lang="la">a
priori</em> and the <em lang="la">a posteriori</em>. By
1961, it is the experience of the face-to-face encounter that
destabilizes the <em lang="la">a priori</em>-<em lang="la">a
posteriori</em> dichotomy by urging that, in the face-to-face, the
third party (humanity) looks at me <em>through</em> the eyes of the
other. This is because the non-spatial &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;
(approach of the other) that is the interruption of our flowing
time-consciousness takes place with an unnoticed spontaneity, yet
likely leaves a trace. That is, consciousness always takes up after
these instants of interruption and reconnects itself as a homogeneous
flow.</p>
 
<p>
In <em>Existence and Existents</em>, Levinas voiced &ldquo;the
profound need to leave the climate of [Heidegger&rsquo;s]
philosophy&rdquo; (EE 4). By 1961 he will have done so, albeit not
without significantly reworking Heidegger&rsquo;s fundamental
ontology. As we have seen, Levinas envisions being as constant,
neutral presence and, at times, like a Hobbesian state of nature.
Jacques Derrida reminds us that this pre-Heideggerian conception is
close to Kant&rsquo;s notion of existence, understood as intensities
in conflict (1997 [1999: 49, 86]). That is why, in its natural
expression, being takes on almost a mechanistic quality in Levinas. In
political and institutional senses, being is conceived as the
encompassing of individuals and communities by the State. On the
latter depend security and property, life and death. But in the
&ldquo;Preface&rdquo; to <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, Levinas
compares the State with systematic philosophy: as the
&lsquo;<em>organon</em>&rsquo; of politics, the State manages commerce
and conflicts, just as it declares wars. Similarly, Hegel&rsquo;s
idealist dialectics oversees and integrates sensibility and cognition,
progressing from the individual to the collective, and expressing the
movement of <em>Geist</em> or Spirit (TI 21&ndash;23; 36&ndash;38;
87&ndash;88).</p>

<p>
Overall, Levinas&rsquo; most sustained criticisms target fundamental
 ontology.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 As we have seen, leaving the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; of
Heidegger&rsquo;s thought motivates his return to more traditional
conceptions of being. To be sure, Levinas was skeptical about deriving
an ethics from ontology. Certainly, such an ethics could not limit
itself to Heidegger&rsquo;s <em>Mitsein</em>, that sociality into
which <em lang="de">Da-sein</em> flees when troubled by its uncanny
groundlessness (its being thrown into-the-world). Having attempted,
from 1935 onward, to carry Heidegger&rsquo;s being-there with its
states of mind or moods (<em lang="de">Befindlichkeiten</em>), down to
more <em>embodied</em> experiences of shame, desire, hunger, and
nausea, Levinas&rsquo; conviction is that <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>
remains too formal an entity to exist in a world in which human
relationality is more substantial than a mere refuge from the anxiety
of groundlessness (BT
 232).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 Although for Heidegger <em>Angst</em> individuates us and discloses
our possibility for &ldquo;the freedom of choosing&hellip;and taking
hold of [ourselves]&rdquo; (BT 232), this process remains solipsistic
in the sense that it is <em>our</em> freedom and <em>our</em>
mortality that are in question. When intensified, <em lang="de">Angst</em>
reveals the groundlessness of our being-there,
ultimately freeing us (individually) for the question: why might there
&lsquo;be&rsquo; anything at all? Against Heidegger, Levinas
understands this framing as tantamount to a hermeneutic universe in
which the idea of our authentic possibility concerns only our death
and underestimates the significance of the encounter with the other
person. Only through a different hermeneutics, which reveals human
existence as embodied and <em>interpersonal</em>, can we conceptualize
the opening to responsibility that the encounter with the other person
creates. <em>For further discussion see
 <a href="supplements.html#SupLevHer">Supplement S.3 on Levinas&rsquo; Hermeneutics</a></em>.</p>
 
<p>
Now, in <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, a further transition occurs,
from the micro-sociality of the face-to-face encounter to social
existence more broadly. This is possible thanks to language as
teaching and dialogue (TI 194&ndash;197; 201&ndash;203), a claim that
Merleau-Ponty would have approved. As indicated, earlier on, Levinas
will open still another path to universalization&mdash;concerning the
whole of humanity&mdash;through the family, in his final section
&ldquo;Beyond the Face&rdquo; (TI 267&ndash;280). Despite this second
path, the question remains how it is that, for Levinas and through the
eyes of the other, the whole of humanity looks at me (TI 213). Gillian
Rose first criticized this limited universalization of responsibility
as lacking important socio-political mediations (1992). Elliot Wolfson
has in turn questioned whether this lack is not based on &ldquo;a
false dichotomy[,] as both [responsibility and socio-political
mediations] are&hellip;indebted conceptually to a Kantian dualism that
neglects the middle&rdquo; (Wolfson 2025: 109). Ernst Wolff
investigated the passage toward universality in light of
Levinas&rsquo; evolving conception of liberal society, from the
latter&rsquo;s skeptical stance toward a more positive appraisal
(Wolff 2007). Finally, Elad Lapidot argues that through Levinas&rsquo;
hermeneutics of the family, we obtain a micro- or meta-politics,
wherein &ldquo;the family [operates] as a counter-figure to the state,
[like] a collective subject against a total object&rdquo; (Lapidot
2021: 16). Lapidot adds arguments for a &ldquo;<em lang="de">v&ouml;lkisch</em>&rdquo;
influence, borrowed here from
 Heidegger.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Levinas admits that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he acuity of the problem [of universalization] lies in the
necessity of maintaining the I in the transcendence [of the
face-to-face] with which it hitherto seemed incompatible [given its
self-interests]. (TI 276)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, although the face-to-face is a momentary interruption, the
trace of responsibility needs to be received and assured in a more
durable way. Thanks to his focus on the family, Levinas does provide a
partial expansion of responsibility by weaving together the
responsibility of the father to his child and the micro-sociality of
family life, in which the trace of interruptive time is historicized.
This choice works responsibility out in terms one might today consider
traditional or patriarchal, i.e., through paternal election and the
service of the son to his brothers; something that, ironically,
resembles the solidarity through intergenerational love found in
Hegel&rsquo;s early theological writings. This leads Levinas to assert
that &ldquo;the fecundity of the I is its very [temporal]
transcendence&rdquo; (TI 277). That is, through the <em>time</em> of
generations, an ego surpasses itself through its children (TI 277).
Thus, even as the time of generations &ldquo;adds something new to
being, something absolutely new&rdquo; (TI 283), i.e., the child, it
also provides a partial mediation between the affective instant of
responsibility and the creation of institutions and practices apt to
ensure that the ethical trace has some potential for extension.</p>

<p>
Rose (1992), Derrida (1964 [1978: 121, 133&ndash;136]), and Didier
Franck (2008: 233&ndash;243) have discussed the difficulty of
mediations; viz., introducing ethics into questions of justice and
politics. Part of the difficulty lies in the tension between
universalization understood as the ethical cultivation of humanity,
versus universalization understood as providing an ethical inflection
to justice broadly conceived. For Levinas, the passage of
responsibility into politics is invariably fragile, because ethical
language is frequently imitated by political rhetoric. Yet, in 1961,
the question of how responsibility and election experienced in the
family passes into a vaster history and public space remains
under-thematized, notably, as it concerns demands for social justice
and equality. Herzog has argued that politics in Levinas is firstly
&ldquo;defined as concern and care for people&rsquo;s hunger&rdquo;,
even before it is interest in power or defense of political rights
(2020: 40).</p>

<p>
Levinas himself responds by urging that the notion of fraternity is
firstly hermeneutic, even before it is biological. Fraternity is an
upshot of intersubjective relations. It flows out of face-to-face
encounters and what he calls the human kinship forged by
&ldquo;monotheism&rdquo; (TI 214). By this Levinas means the ethical
core or essence of Judaism. As he argues,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the very status of the human implies fraternity and the idea of the
human race. Fraternity is radically opposed to the conception of a
humanity united by resemblance, a multiplicity of diverse families
arisen from the stones cast behind by Deucalion, and which, across the
struggle of egoisms, results in a human city. (TI 214)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unification in difference is thus created only when monotheism results
in a law that equalizes those obliged by it. Levinas similarly traces
what he calls originary &ldquo;religion&rdquo; to the face-to-face,
following his phenomenological genealogy of it (TI 40). Commentators
have nevertheless insisted that, unless ethics can correct or amend
justice on the basis of a subject&rsquo;s experience of
responsibility, the possibility its expansion remains open to doubt
(Wolff 2007: 383&ndash;399). For many commentators, interpersonal
responsibility remains the exception not the rule (Froese 2020). For
hermeneutics (Hans-Georg Gadamer), responsibility itself depends on
dialogue and established tradition, not on the abstract call of the
other. Responsibility may be subject to codification, though that
would be the concern of ethical theory, which is not Levinas&rsquo;
priority (Morgan 2007: 238).</p>

<p>
Two dilemmas thus arise in <em>Totality and Infinity</em>. It is an
open question whether they are laid to rest in <em>Otherwise than
Being</em>. The first concerns the dichotomy between what was
traditionally called free will versus nature; the second, the
aforementioned socio-cultural mediations between families and States.
In the first case, it may be surprising that Levinas characterizes
human existence in terms resembling those of physiological
determinism, that is, in terms of drives and the interests flowing out
of them. For him, the problem of reconciling freedom and nature would
be one of interrupting the activity of the drives, which is the bodily
substrate of consciousness, and which contributes to its dynamic
temporal unity. Understanding the will, then, does not begin with
freedom so much as with something closer to <em lang="la">conatus
essendi</em> (i.e., with something &ldquo;natural&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Levinas proves close to Hobbes and Kant here. For the latter, the
motivation to <em>disregard</em> one&rsquo;s interests in favor of the
moral law lies in the affect called <em lang="de">Achtung</em>. Kant
urged that <em lang="de">Achtung</em> be considered in its negative
and positive aspects: negatively, as attention or freedom
<em>from</em> sensuous distraction. In its positive sense, <em lang="de">Achtung</em>
corresponds to <em>reverentia</em>, respect,
understood as the freedom to grasp the law as something eminently
worthy of adherence, despite its imposed constraint. Moreover,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the presentation of something as [the] <em>determining basis of our
will</em> humbles us in our self-consciousness when we compare it with
the sensible propensity of our nature. (Kant KPV 1788: Pt I bk I
ch. 3, AA 5: 74 [2002: 98]; Nancy 1983 [2003: 142]; Basterra 2015:
91&ndash;98)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As the focus of attention and motivation, <em lang="de">Achtung</em>
is unique in that it is what Kant calls an <em>intellectual</em>
affect (Kant KPV 1788 [2002: 87 / AA: 66]). It has no direct relationship
to our bodily make-up, which, as we know also from Levinas, is
indissociably tied up with drives and instincts. When thus motivated,
practical reason determines itself to act out of respect for a law
indemonstrable by theoretical reason. Practical reason thereby
discovers freedom in the <em>performance</em> of its moral act. It is
only then, <em lang="la">post facto</em>, that freedom is found to
have reality, through self-obedience.</p>

<p>
Basterra has argued that Kant&rsquo;s ethics affords us an important
insight into the question of nature versus freedom in Levinas. Whereas
for both, the will follows its natural course (desires and emotions),
something outside it <em>may</em> compel it toward ethical behavior or
responsibility. For Kant, the categorical imperative does not
&ldquo;belong&rdquo; to the self-positing subject, but rather
addresses them as if <em>from without</em> and elicits humility. For
Levinas, it is the face of the other that addresses us this way and
focuses our attention, prior to our considering that face&rsquo;s
empirical qualities (sex, ethnicity, etc.) (Basterra 2015:
125&ndash;126). Recently, Wenjing Cai (2021) has observed that
Basterra&rsquo;s arguments for a limited reconciliation between Kant
and Levinas produce &ldquo;an otherness or excess within the
subject&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Basterra&hellip;argues that both the Kantian moral law and
Levinas&rsquo;s other indicate an otherness or excess within the
subject, thereby making the subject of freedom an auto-heteronomous
one. (2021: 406)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For his part, Alexander Altonji (2023) argues that Levinas&rsquo;
concrete other is not only normative but that the command expressed in
the face (&ldquo;you shall not kill&rdquo;) provides the best answer
to the skeptics&rsquo; problem of other minds and other existences
(Altonji 2023: 67). So much for recent debates on Levinas&rsquo; 1961
treatment of freedom and nature.</p>

<p>
Let us turn now toward the second dilemma: the fraught relationship
between ethics and politics. In 1961, Levinas characterizes politics
and drives as unfolding in a similar fashion. Both are sites for the
manifestation of the will to persist in existence. He doubts that
politics, when &ldquo;left to itself&rdquo;, can long remain ethical
(TI 300; Wolff 2007: 129). However, he remarks that justice can be
addressed as an ethical <em>demand</em> posed to some States, notably
liberal ones.</p>

<p>
This does not solve the problem of mediations yet suggests that
Rose&rsquo;s Hegelian objection may be misguided. After all, what do
the mediations ultimately serve, if not the <em>finality</em> of the
State as overarching protector and
 regulator?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 Levinas was aware of this. In 1951, in his first published article on
the State of Israel, he did not hesitate to forestall accusations of
idolatry even against a Jewish State. Arguing philosophically that the
&ldquo;State is not an idol because it precisely permits full
self-consciousness&rdquo;, he added that modern humans
&ldquo;acknowledge [their] spiritual nature&hellip;when acting in the
service of the State and in their dignity as
 citizens&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 This is indeed why, he added, the decline of organized religions is
tied to the advent of modern States. Here and elsewhere, he recognized
that a State, and preeminently one founded on a religion, embodied a
paradox whose solution&mdash;in Israel&rsquo;s case at
least&mdash;could only be found in an approach to religion as the
<em>symbolic</em> pendant of ethical responsibility (DF 218). He
thereupon added the more existential claim that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the Jewish people craved their own land and their own State, not
because of the abstract independence which they desired, but because
they could then finally begin the work of their lives. (DF 218)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clearly, this is not an exhaustive solution to the problem of
mediations between family (or ethnicity) and the State (or politics).
We will return to this question in section 2.4.5. <em>For a discussion
of other commentators, see
 <a href="supplements.html#SupComLevPol">Supplement S.4 on Commentators on Levinas&rsquo; Politics</a></em></p>
 
<h3 id="OthThaBeiBeyEss197TraImm">2.4 Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence (1974): Transcendence-in-Immanence</h3>

<p>
<em>Otherwise than Being</em> grew up around its core fourth chapter,
entitled &ldquo;Substitution&rdquo; and first published in 1968 (OBBE
99&ndash;129; also see Bernasconi 2002; see further Simon Critchley
1999: 183&ndash;197). It is a justifiable simplification to say that
Levinas&rsquo; concept of substitution corresponds to that of
responsibility, explored this time as relationality in immanence
rather than as &ldquo;my&rdquo; response to the face, understood as
<em>exteriority</em>. In this work, Levinas uses the term
&ldquo;<em>int&eacute;riorit&eacute;</em>&rdquo; repeatedly, which the
translator renders as &ldquo;inwardness&rdquo;, perhaps to avoid
introducing spatial binaries (OBBE 28, 87, 92, 108, 119). The work is
not about inner-outer dichotomies, much less cognitive operations, or
memories of events or things. It has little to do with the
phenomenological discoveries emerging through what Husserl called
&ldquo;making present (<em lang="de">Vergegenw&auml;rtigung</em>)&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Inwardness&rdquo; denotes a bodily life as if haunted by
others, which is also now called &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; (OBBE
81&ndash;94; Sebbah 2018b, 51&ndash;52 n. 17). Comparable in this to
Husserl&rsquo;s horizon of apperceptions, inwardness entails a
spectrum of affective tones. Unlike Husserl, however, these tones
require recourse to discursive figures that Levinas now borrows from
psychology, poetics, hermeneutics, even theology and dogmatics (e.g.,
&ldquo;obsession&rdquo;, &ldquo;persecution&rdquo;,
&ldquo;recurrence&rdquo;, &ldquo;too tight in its skin&rdquo;,
&ldquo;exile&rdquo;, &ldquo;maternity&rdquo;, &ldquo;love&rdquo;, and
finally &ldquo;expiation&rdquo; and
 &ldquo;kenosis&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup> 
 While thus concerned with intersubjective
affectivity in its immediate passive undergoing, substitution is
manifest in human practice, the domain in which we experience
 immediacy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
By 1974, then, transcendence, understood as the other
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; me, has become transcendence-in-immanence, in a
sense closer to Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s account of intercorporeity,
which similarly urged that philosophies of embodiment should never
<em>oppose</em> the terms immanence and transcendence (PP 308). For
Levinas, the concept of the other would still refer to the face as
expression and exteriority, but it would denote principally the
&ldquo;inwardness&rdquo; of memories that are not about objects yet
whose <em>affective</em> return or &ldquo;recurrence&rdquo; further
complexifies the linear time schema of Husserl&rsquo;s early
phenomenological consciousness (OBBE 88).</p>

<p>
This insistence on living presence and practice, which represent
Levinas&rsquo; resistance to objectification, can also be found today
in phenomenologies that underscore the difference between a
third-person perspective and a first-person one. Sebbah (2018a) has
argued this point in light of what he calls an ethics of the
&ldquo;survivor&rdquo;. Some have objected that Levinas&rsquo; late
work reflected a certain survivor&rsquo;s guilt. Sebbah takes up this
charge resolutely, emphasizing that in Levinas&rsquo; philosophy the
dead (those who did not survive) are not phantoms or even traces
confined in archival documents. At the pre-reflective level, they do
not belong to &ldquo;the world&rdquo;, or to an economy of being, so
much as they carry on as affective saliences&mdash;persisting
unremarked in our intersubjective relations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hence, preserving traces without life (i.e., without a living face),
or even more in &ldquo;enclosing&rdquo; them within the horizon of the
World, like tools among tools&hellip;or again in enclosing them within
re-presentation through memory, ultimately comes down to
endangering&hellip;the authentic [living] relation to the
 other.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
According to Sebbah, only the lived immediacy of the face-to-face
holds the ontological order metaphorically open to transcendence. This
first-person perspective is a theme that goes back to
Maimonides&rsquo; negative theological critique of human language in
light of the divine attributes of practice. In short, transcendence,
expressed as the Good, is an old theme in Judaism. Levinas adapts it
to his hermeneutic phenomenology and, by 1974, the immediacy of the
face-to-face will be extended into the immanence of lived memory, even
as these affective memories condition our interactions with
others.</p>

<h4 id="StrWor_1">2.4.1 The Structure of the Work</h4>

<p>
<em>Otherwise than Being</em> opens with a general overview of the
argument, in which being and transcendence are also named
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; and &ldquo;disinterest&rdquo;. Emphasizing the
processual quality of being, Levinas will refer to it equivalently as
&ldquo;being&rdquo; <em>or</em> &ldquo;essence&rdquo;, venturing that
he might even have used the dynamic form
&ldquo;<em>essance</em>&rdquo; (OBBE 187 note 1). Responsibility will
be focused and discussed as the condition of possibility of all verbal
signification (OBBE 43&ndash;47). <em>Totality and
Infinity</em>&rsquo;s themes of conversation and teaching thus recede
into the background. Levinas now makes a more strategic use of the
body as flesh, that is, as a locus with simultaneously an inside and
an outside, as in Merleau-Ponty. Subjectivity is again framed
affectively as the coming to pass of responsibility, although this
time the phenomenological approach to intentionality is analyzed into
its basic layer of sensibility that Levinas calls
&ldquo;<em>pre-originary</em> susceptiveness [<em>susception</em>
pr&eacute;-originaire]&rdquo; (OBBE 122, 136&ndash;138). For him, that
means that subjectivity always entails pre-cognitive dimensions that
are from the outset intersubjectively conditioned. The other has
become other-in-the-same, as indicated.</p>

<p>
To be sure, the other-in-the-same is not <em>objectively</em>
different from the factical other who faces me, because neither one is
an object and both are expressions or modes of alterity. As we will
see, the other-in-the-same describes a pre-thematic &ldquo;call&rdquo;
or &ldquo;investiture&rdquo; (indeed I never know when I
<em>first</em> experienced this other in me) (OBBE 125). Levinas
adopts the middle voice, of passivity-activity, here: &ldquo;All my
inwardness is invested [<em lang="fr">s&rsquo;investit</em>] in the
form of a despite-me, for-another&rdquo; (OBBE 11). Thus, in
<em>Otherwise than Being</em>, Levinas has returned to Husserl&rsquo;s
inquiries into passive synthesis, to the latter&rsquo;s perplexities
about the stretching of our retentions of experiences, about the
unbidden spontaneity of our associations, and the near-infinity of
sensuous horizons&mdash;all part of a process unfolding passively in
what Husserl called in 1926 &ldquo;a phenomenology of the so-called
 unconscious&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 In light of this return, we should not approach interiority and
exteriority as opposed terms, but as felt dimensions of
intersubjectivity and the inhabitation of a self by alterity.</p>

<p>
The second chapter approaches Heidegger&rsquo;s discussion of language
as the way in which being becomes, the way it temporalizes (BT
 &sect;44b).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
 Levinas revisits Heidegger&rsquo;s argument that the <em>logos</em>
gathers up being and makes possible being&rsquo;s unveiling (<em lang="grc">al&#275;theia</em>).
He will argue that the lapse of time
<em>between</em> lived immediacy and its reflective representation is
<em>never</em> fully gathered by the <em>logos</em>. Therefore, the
temporal lapse poses a challenge to language understood as
Heidegger&rsquo;s gathering. It falls, much the way that transcendence
as interruption did in 1961, outside the realm of being-as-gathering,
even though Levinas still considers being and language as processes of
totalization, as an all-encompassing system. His rethinking of the
lapse, with transcendence-in-immanence, will be Levinas&rsquo;
ultimate modification of Heidegger&rsquo;s project. Together, the
lapse and this new conception of transcendence do ultimately pass
through language, albeit as practice, as words addressed to someone. I
will come back to this. For now, suffice it to say that it is the
inhabitation of a self by alterity that forms the sensuous conditions
of possibility of speech. Thus it is not being that addresses us
through language, it is quite different; it is human alterity.</p>

<p>
Two additional innovations in <em>Otherwise than Being</em>
include:</p>

<ol>

<li>the proposed phenomenological reduction to the birth of meaning in
a bodily self that carries within itself what it cannot identify
<em>as</em> properly itself (the &ldquo;other&rdquo;, affectively).
This appears to be a expansion of Husserl&rsquo;s discussion of the
pre-reflective ego in <em>Ideas II</em> (&sect;58, &ldquo;Supplement
12&rdquo; &sect;&sect;2&ndash;3). Whereas Husserl emphasized the basis
of the ego in its ongoing flow of lived experience, a flow
characterized as &ldquo;lawful&rdquo;, on the basis of its own
principles, Levinas focuses on discontinuities in time-consciousness
(see also Franck 1981 [2013: 149&ndash;166]).</li>

<li>A hermeneutics of the self, emerging through intersubjective
contact in which the &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; of the other elicits
passive &ldquo;substitution&rdquo; and opens onto spontaneous
responding (OBBE 113&ndash;121). In what suggests an attempt at
deepening Husserl&rsquo;s concept of empathy (<em lang="de">Einf&uuml;hlung</em>)
(OBBE 125), the tropes of proximity,
recurrence, and substitution characterize the pre-cognitive
intersubjective intertwining that makes communication possible:
&ldquo;Communication would be impossible if it should have to begin in
the ego, [in] a free subject, to whom every other would be only a
limitation that invites war&rdquo; (OBBE 119).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Indeed, prior to spoken or written language, prior to signs
reciprocally exchanged, &ldquo;we suppose that there is in the
transcendence involved in language a relationship that is not
empirical speech, but responsibility&rdquo; (OBBE 120). Levinas calls
this theme, inspired by Franz Rosenzweig&rsquo;s <em lang="de">Stammwort</em>
(root-word), &ldquo;my pre-originary
 <em>susceptiveness</em>&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 In Levinas, the nature of intersubjective sensibility shares its
time-structure with strong passions, sometimes indeed with trauma
(OBBE 122&ndash;124). As Levinas writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[this susceptiveness] describes the suffering and vulnerability of the
sensuous as <em>the other in me</em>&hellip;. [T]he ipseity [also
known as embodied selfhood] has become at odds with itself in its
return to itself. The self-accusation of remorse gnaws away at the
closed and firm core of consciousness&hellip;fissioning it
[in its temporal unity]. (OBBE 124&ndash;125)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consequently, vulnerability and sensitivity to trauma not only provoke
retreat into self but heighten our awareness, however tenuous, of our
connection with the other. Thereupon they motivate verbal address and
ultimately, bearing witness. Thus, the affective in-habitation of my
self by an other precedes formal speech-acts and speech-communities.
If the reverse were the case, that is, if a sociological community
were posited as prior to the event of the address, then this would
presuppose what it was meant to show: the affective genesis of
speech-acts (OBBE 92). In other words, &ldquo;beneath&rdquo; words
proffered lies a fundamental vulnerability that psychology might
interpret as a tendency to witnessing, from oneself to the other.
Levinas calls this vulnerability the &ldquo;Saying&rdquo; (OBBE
149&ndash;152). It is the condition of possibility of words uttered in
the form of response (i.e., pre-linguistic), and it accompanies
communication like its affective horizon. The duality of Saying and
Said, or words uttered, is a new concept in Levinas&rsquo; late
work.</p>

<p>
Building on the exploration of proximity begun in chapter three,
chapters four and five evince a tone more somber than any found
hitherto in Levinas&rsquo; <em>&oelig;uvre</em>. This is in keeping
with the dedications of the book, written in Hebrew and in French,
which announce that it will be a work of mourning. While Derrida
characterized <em>Totality and Infinity</em> as a phenomenology of
hospitality (Derrida 1997 [1999: 21]), <em>Otherwise than Being</em>
commemorates the &ldquo;victims of the&hellip;hatred of the other
man&rdquo;. It develops the parallel between semiotic
&ldquo;substitution&rdquo; of a word for a thing (the signifying
function of all language) and the affective substitution of myself for
an other, extended through a spectrum of acts of self-sacrifice, from
daily empathy to interventions enacted for the other. This is what
Levinas calls the one-for-the-other (OBBE 45&ndash;50, 70&ndash;74,
119&ndash;129). Whereas Heidegger had explored the hermeneutics of <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>,
for whom communication unfolds thanks to our
(as <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>) taking or equivalently offering
&ldquo;this [thing or word] as that [thing]&rdquo; (BT &sect;31),
Levinas will arguably set Heidegger&rsquo;s &ldquo;as&rdquo; into his
 &ldquo;for&rdquo;:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 Heidegger&rsquo;s &ldquo;this <em>as</em> that&rdquo; becomes
Levinas&rsquo; &ldquo;one <em>for</em> the other&rdquo; of
substitution. While responsibility expressed the unfolding of the
intersubjective affects that Levinas compared to Plato&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Good beyond Being&rdquo; in 1961 (TI 292&ndash;293,
304&ndash;307), the good of substitution is more ambiguous, occurring
&ldquo;on the brink of tears and laughter&rdquo; (OBBE 18), yet also
&ldquo;glorious&rdquo; (OBBE 94, 140&ndash;144).</p>

<p>
The experience of time characteristic of trauma and mourning does not
take the place of Husserlian phenomenology&rsquo;s flowing
 time-consciousness,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 any more than it replaces the succession and uninterruptedness of
clock time. If what-is results from the self-giving of things to the
focus of phenomenological attention, and if together they invariably
find a place in the formal flow of time-consciousness, then even for
Husserl what-is, i.e., being, temporalizes as consciousness. Husserl
had always urged that, insofar as there is appearing, there is an
indication of being (CM &sect;46; also see Heidegger, BT &sect;7). For
Heidegger, being temporalizes through <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>,
which is out-ahead-of-itself or oriented toward its future. Yet if, in
both their cases, being unfolds temporally, then for Levinas, our
sensibility shows a different temporal character, because the
sensibility called the other-in-the-same returns and repeats rather
than flows. In its new somber tones as trauma and mourning,
responsibility recurs without definitively halting the flow of
time-consciousness. This is why Levinas referred to the cluster of
concepts around substitution as <em>adverbial</em>: they inflect or
modalize being (understood as processual) and its time, thereby
temporarily modifying it. Indeed, when being is understood as the
verbal dynamism expressed by &ldquo;essence&rdquo;, then
responsibility and substitution can only be compared to ad-verbs.
Hence the title, <em>autrement</em>, other-wise (than being), which
itself is an adverb (OBBE 35). This is a kind of wager; it does not
abrogate the ontological character of existence; rather, it suggests
inflections of it.</p>

<p>
The final half of chapter five recurs to the performative register of
language. It seeks to convey the tension of a consciousness striving
to consolidate itself in the wake of alterity as affective
investiture, by which its passivity slowly becomes active witnessing.
This opening out of inward affects becoming gestures of generosity
motivates <em>Otherwise than Being</em>&rsquo;s recourse to the new
performative language. Levinas adds,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
and I still interrupt the ultimate discourse in which all the
discourses are stated, in saying it to one that listens&hellip;That is
true of the discussion I am elaborating at this very moment. (OBBE
170; see Derrida&rsquo;s commentary on this, 1980 [1991])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He is no doubt aware of the seemingly artificial quality of calling
his authorial witness &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;. But Levinas&rsquo;
claim is more than a literary artifice. Basterra compares it to
Kant&rsquo;s idea of autonomy, which shows itself only when we follow
a law that &ldquo;exceeds and addresses the subject&rdquo;, motivating
its ethical act (Basterra 2015: 126). Earlier in her
above-mentioned study, she had argued that the intellectual affect of
<em lang="de">Achtung</em> was capable of focusing our attention and
opening us to a respect comparable to Levinas&rsquo; Saying, which he
also calls &ldquo;sincerity&rdquo;. For pure reason, autonomy
&ldquo;is therefore an illusion&rdquo;, but it is one only insofar as
that which is not intrinsically part of <em>my</em> interests can
still motivate me to act. Thus pure reason erroneously supposes that
my ethical gesture came <em>from</em> me (Basterra 2015: 129). Levinas
provides us a crucial hermeneutics of the intersubjective origin of
this &ldquo;illusion&rdquo; denounced in the first <em>Critique</em>.
He sets the heteronomy of Kant&rsquo;s practical reason into a
hermeneutic register, referring to the sincerity underlying the words
we offer: &ldquo;It is in the risky uncovering of oneself, in
sincerity, the breaking up of inwardness&hellip;exposure to traumas,
vulnerability&rdquo; that I bear witness to and for another (OBBE 48).
Again, this does not come from us. It arises from being faced by an
other, and it persists as affective memory in our lived body. Indeed,
when asked, Levinas finds illustrations of such witnessing in many
places, from the justice imperative of the Biblical prophets to the
concern of Latin American clerics over the events unfolding in Chile
in 1973 (OGCM 81&ndash;82).</p>

<h4 id="NewExiMooFleMem">2.4.2 New Existential Moods and Fleshly Memories</h4>

<p>
As in his 1935 discussion of need and nausea, Levinas argues in
<em>Otherwise than Being</em> that lived sensibility often overflows
representations of it. And again, he proposes sensuous modes different
from Heidegger&rsquo;s <em lang="de">Befindlichkeiten</em> (see
&sect;2.2 <em>supra</em>), in which all understanding takes place for
him (BT 17). Indeed, interwoven layers of affectivity are unfolded in
<em>Otherwise than Being</em>. Levinas explores the sensuous-affective
proto-experience of the other in light of <em>new</em> moods, writing:
&ldquo;Remorse is the trope of the literal sense of sensibility. In
its passivity is erased the distinction between being accused and
accusing oneself&rdquo; (OBBE 125). Unlike <em>Existence and
Existents</em>, wherein light overcomes the distinction between
subjects and objects, allowing the subject to make an object
intelligible for itself within the horizon of its appearing (EE 41),
<em>Otherwise than Being</em> approaches transcendence in sensuous and
temporal terms, arguing for the insistence of a past that eludes
thematization, what he calls the &ldquo;immemorial&rdquo; (OBBE
122&ndash;123). Transcendence for an embodied being would always thus
be transcendence-in-immanence. The affective &ldquo;experience&rdquo;
of my relations with particular others is preserved as a trace or
pre-thematic reminiscence of the flesh, as &ldquo;a relationship with
a singularity without the mediation of any principle, any
ideality&rdquo; (OBBE 100). Invoking <em>Otherwise than Being</em>
(OBBE 105&ndash;107), John Llewelyn called this affective dimension of
invested selfhood, or &ldquo;ipseity&rdquo;, a
&ldquo;&lsquo;deep&rsquo; saying&rdquo; that &ldquo;bears witness to
what is neither recollected nor forgotten <em>in the epistemic
sense</em> of these terms when [or once] it is represented as a
sign&rdquo; (Llewelyn 2002:
 135).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As indicated, <em>Otherwise than Being</em> problematizes
Levinas&rsquo; earlier, more ontological approach in <em>Totality and
Infinity</em>. He proceeds now on the basis of Husserl&rsquo;s
inquiries into passive syntheses, notes on intersubjectivity, and <em lang="de">Einf&uuml;hlung</em>
(empathy). There is good reason for
this. Responsibility denoted an event that repeats, and even
intensifies as it is assumed (already TI 100&ndash;101). In
<em>Otherwise than Being</em>, however, the question of immanence and
passivity arises in regard to responsibility&rsquo;s unremarked
persistence and its affective upwellings in us. This is because the
status of a memory of sensuous events, which may have affected us
outside of any representation we form, is elusive. For the
phenomenologist, it might correspond to an apperception or horizon, in
the sense of something that conditions perception but is not directly
perceived. Thus Levinas also insists that, unlike the apperceptions
Husserl explored thanks to the reduction he set on
 memory,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup>
 <em>this</em> affective past continues to escape thematization
because it was never intentional at all, and because
&ldquo;memories&rdquo; of our lived flesh precede the consolidation of
our ego (OBBE 
 144&ndash;147).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup>
 John Drabinski has explored this
&ldquo;pre-history&rdquo; in light of Levinas&rsquo; reprise of
genetic phenomenology (2001: 185&ndash;206). Theodor de Boer
approaches it as an echo of both Rosenzweig and Jewish prophetism
(1997: 87&ndash;100). Sebbah (2018a, 39&ndash;57) argues that the
&ldquo;subject&rdquo; of such &ldquo;trials&rdquo; must be the
witness; he argues that Levinas proposes a
unique <em lang="la">epoch&#275;</em> through which to approach
affective vulnerability.</p>

<p>
Levinas is aware that a counter-temporality of the affects is open to
critique. He even reminds us that skepticism&mdash;even that
concerning his hermeneutic wager&mdash;obeys an ethical imperative to
deconstruct philosophy and with it, all totalizing discourses, whether
they are logical or political (OBBE 168&ndash;170).</p>
 
<p>
Unlike Husserl, Levinas does not theorize a system consisting of
levels of drives and affects intentionalized by higher egoic
 acts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 He does exploit, however, a difficulty that beset Husserl&rsquo;s
early eidetic phenomenology. The difficulty concerns bodily sensation
in relation to the flow of intentionality, as discussed by Husserl in
Appendix 12 of his lectures on inner time-consciousness (PCIT
 130&ndash;133).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>
 For Husserl, in order to be experienced, sensation had to be
intentional. Whereas, ever for him, the bodily <em>origins</em> of
intentionality were the concern of physiological psychology, he
recognized that the ongoing alterations in the body accounted for our
<em>feeling</em> of temporal progression. In short, as they
intentionalized, sensuous changes were in fact responsible for the
experience of the flow of inner time, the same flow precisely that
conferred temporal order upon conscious sensations. Phenomenology
thereby remained consistent with itself as the eidetics of
consciousness. But it did so at the price of disregarding preconscious
processes, like what Husserl later called <em>affektive
Kr&auml;fte</em> (affective forces) that would only be explored later
in phenomenology&rsquo;s genetic period starting around 1918.</p>

<p>
Levinas first addressed Husserl&rsquo;s difficulty in his 1965 essay,
&ldquo;Intentionality and Sensation&rdquo; (DEH 135&ndash;150).
Intentionalizing sensation was, he said, &ldquo;[t]he original mark of
Husserlian idealism&rdquo; (DEH 141). Unlike Husserl, who addressed
the problem with his speculative use of concepts like &ldquo;affective
forces&rdquo; (<em lang="de">affektive Kr&auml;fte</em>), Levinas
developed his conception of &ldquo;diachrony&rdquo; 1974, OBBE
9&ndash;10, 52), that is, the sensuous interruption that he equated
with transcendence-in-immanence.  Levinas focused on the gap (i.e.,
diachrony) between bodily sensation entering intentionality and
sensation as pre-conscious processes occurring at the intersubjective
level.</p>

<p>
Levinas thus compared the duality of sensibility as conscious
<em>and</em> preconscious to his idea of a pre-intentional
&ldquo;receptivity of an &lsquo;other&rsquo; penetrating into the
&lsquo;same&rsquo;, [in sum, into our intersubjective] life and not
[into] &lsquo;thought&rsquo;&rdquo; (DEH 144). This sensuous alterity
will support two important claims; i.e., that intersubjective affects
overflow the framework of representational consciousness, and that
affective interruptions can obtrude on the even flow of
 time-consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup>
 Similarly, Sophie Veulemans has compared Levinas&rsquo; diachrony
with Bergson&rsquo;s approach to the &ldquo;new&rdquo; (sensuous
modification) in the midst of duration (Veulemans 2008). Rudolf
Bernet, in turn, equates the newness of the phenomenological instant
with &ldquo;the root of all alterity and all difference&rdquo; in
Levinas. This allows Bernet to urge that the intersubjective
investiture of the subject &ldquo;will always [prove] unthinkable in a
philosophy of consciousness&rdquo; (Bernet 2002: 93; also see OBBE
124). Following his argument, classical phenomenology would not have
adequately thought through the sensuous way &ldquo;in which the other
liberates the subject from its captivity within &hellip;[its own]
immanence&rdquo; (Bernet 2002: 93).</p>

<h4 id="SaySai">2.4.3 The Saying and the Said</h4>

<p>
<em>Otherwise than Being</em> involves an innovative discussion of
signification. Given Levinas&rsquo; hermeneutic insight that language
is not merely a system of words paired up with pre-existing objective
realities, but instead brings reality to light, language and time will
have analogous
 functions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 That is, both make meaning possible as the realization of ourselves
in the world. Indeed, while Heidegger had argued that being resonates
in (poetic) language as the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo;, Levinas
counter-argued for an otherwise than being that glimmered in
ad-verbial meaning, opening to transcendence. Yet, if the relationship
between language and being is fully encompassing, as it is for
Heidegger, then either Levinas&rsquo; otherwise than being looks like
mere speculation, or it simply inheres in being or participates in its
verb-like dynamism. Either way, fundamental ontology thereby proves
primordial and weakens Levinas&rsquo; claims. That being said, for
him, the transcendence indicated by the adverbial points toward a
temporality that differs both from the flow of time-consciousness as
theorized by Husserl and from the self-temporalization characteristic
of <em lang="de">Da-sein</em> in Heidegger (i.e., as
out-ahead-of-itself toward its ownmost possibility) (OBBE
169&ndash;170, 178&ndash;182).</p>

<p>
The lapse of time between the pre-intentional sensuous moment and its
intentionalization in consciousness corresponds to what Levinas calls
the &ldquo;Saying&rdquo; (OBBE 37&ndash;55), the condition of
possibility of words addressed. His discussion of the Saying
correlates with his treatment of sincerity, introduced already in
<em>Existence and Existents</em>. <em>Otherwise than Being</em>
radicalizes this notion, insisting that the structure of sensibility
is always as if punctuated by sensuous lapses. It is thanks to such
temporal lapses that we are open and able to communicate because, as
we have seen, proximity is an affective mode that motivates dialogue.
While <em>all</em> sensuous lapses are not necessarily openings to
intersubjective relationality, proximity and vulnerability are the
<em>loci</em> of transcendence-in-immanence and the birth of
signification (whether words are actually uttered or not). For
Levinas, there is more in living affectivity than in what
Heidegger&rsquo;s conception of being speaking through language had
captured. This becomes clear the moment we understand signification
originally as an affective pre-intentionality and not as some thought,
already formulated, that the I thereupon chooses to communicate to an
other (OBBE 43).</p>

<p>
Levinas thus conceives language as more than denotation and
description. Already verbs escape the coupling of words with things
that we find in the case of the noun. &ldquo;In the verb of apophansis
[predication], which is the verb properly so called, [i.e.,] the verb
&lsquo;to be&rsquo;, essence resounds and is heard&rdquo; (OBBE 41).
&ldquo;Red reddens&rdquo; without requiring conversion into
propositions; sounds resound in music and poetry. Nevertheless, a verb
<em>can</em> be converted into a noun, thereby losing its processual
quality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Through the ambiguousness of the logos&hellip;the verb par excellence
[&ldquo;being&rdquo;] in which essence resounds&hellip;is nominalized,
becomes a word designating and sanctioning identities, assembling
time&hellip;into a conjuncture;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or situation (OBBE 42). Hence, even the verbality or event-like
quality of being can take on a nominal form, such as in
&ldquo;<em>a</em> being&rdquo;. Levinas calls this convertibility
&ldquo;the amphibology of being and entities [beings]&rdquo; (OBBE
43). While this reciprocal reference expresses the danger of taking
being for a thing&mdash;a danger about which Heidegger warned
us&mdash;what Levinas calls the amphibology neglects a unique aspect
of some verbs: their reflexive quality.</p>

<p>
Thus verbs like <em lang="fr">se dire</em>, understood as &ldquo;to
say&rdquo; but in a reflexive sense, are determined by the &ldquo;<em lang="fr">se</em>&rdquo;
or self, as though one were thereby saying
<em>oneself</em>, self-communicating. Levinas now sets <em>his</em>
ethical-hermeneutic reduction on the reflexive particle <em lang="fr">se</em>,
urging that, although being &ldquo;speaks&rdquo;
through the <em lang="grc">logos</em>, the <em lang="fr">se</em>
points toward a mode of our embodied sensuous passivity (OBBE
43&ndash;45). In short, Levinas accepts the Heideggerian claim about
being expressing itself through language, but he adds the observation
that reflexive verbs bespeak a subjective giving that is not found in
verbs, transitive or intransitive. The &ldquo;<em lang="fr">se</em>&rdquo;
is not itself a verb, it corresponds to the
passive pre-condition of communication, the way a self would also do.
This passivity is enigmatic because the <em lang="fr">se</em> is
neither a verb nor even a noun; it is considered a particle or a
reflexive pronoun. Yet this particle is indispensable to the middle
voice of a host of verbs in many Latin languages. It is thanks to its
enigmatic function that our subjective vulnerability to the other
grounds the dynamics of words said to that other. To this reflexive
<em lang="fr">se</em> corresponds our passivity as it comes to light
in the temporal lapse called &ldquo;diachrony&rdquo;. Diachrony
thereby expresses our sincerity toward the other and transcendence,
understood in a practical sense: &ldquo;[T]he spirit hears the echo of
the <em>otherwise</em>&rdquo; (OBBE 44) in the words we offer and
perform, and thus not merely <em>as</em> the words we offer. With the
adverb (&ldquo;other<em>wise</em>&rdquo;), a modalization of fleshly
investiture momentarily escapes the nominalization available to many
verbs, including that of being (i.e., between being and <em>a</em>
being). As indicated, we find here the practical sense of
transcendence, which Levinas compares with Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s
&ldquo;fundamental historicity&rdquo;, those unremarked, passive
bodily sedimentations that make up our selfhood (OBBE 45).</p>

<h4 id="HerJewPhi">2.4.4 Hermeneutics and Jewish Philosophy</h4>

<p>
Levinas&rsquo; later work, notably <em>Otherwise than Being</em>, has
been characterized as hermeneutical. Focusing on the discussions of
the other-in-the-same and passivity in that work, commentator Giuseppe
Lissa provides an apt description of Levinas&rsquo; interpretive
project. By investigating the depths of consciousness, by comparing
its passivity to the process of ageing, Levinas investigates a</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
reality unknowable, but perhaps interpretable by a thinking that no
longer claims to be an exercise in knowledge&hellip;because this
thinking is engaged in the search for a meaning that precedes all
knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lissa concludes that Levinas intimates a meaning that, in
&ldquo;preceding [knowledge], founds it, orients it, and to some
degree justifies it&rdquo; (Lissa 2002: 227). For him, Levinas&rsquo;
turn to hermeneutics largely dates from his abandonment of the
phenomenology of &ldquo;exteriority&rdquo;, as the subtitle of
<em>Totality and Infinity</em> indicates: <em>An Essay on
Exteriority</em>. As we have seen, insofar as the search for meaning
underlying all manner of intentional constitution and other modes of
intentionality presupposes a meaning only incipiently
grasped&mdash;something that corresponds to Heidegger&rsquo;s
rethinking of hermeneutics in light of <em lang="de">Da-sein</em>&rsquo;s
basic understanding&mdash;Levinas
appears to owe a debt to two forms of hermeneutic practice. On the one
hand, to Heidegger&rsquo;s existential
 hermeneutics;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup>
 on the other, to a much older, polyphonic practice of reading. This
is Talmudic thought interpretively elaborating Jewish law
(<em>Halakhah</em>) and recounting and parsing narratives
(<em>Aggadah</em>). Lapidot (2021) refers to this dualism as an
&ldquo;inter-epistemic&rdquo; divide, which is sometimes carried in
philosophy as an &ldquo;inner-philosophical drama&rdquo; (2021: 5).
According to Lapidot, this divide between &ldquo;Athens&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; is fecund, as it permits Levinas to mobilize
Jewish traditions to interrupt the tendency of systematic epistemology
to conceptualize the world (cf. &ldquo;ontological imperialism&rdquo;,
as Lapidot writes, citing <em>Totality and Infinity</em>). To be sure,
a significant difference between this hermeneutics and that of
Christian theology lies in its giving less weight to philosophical
justifications of <em>faith</em>. Let us turn briefly to this
hermeneutics.</p>

<p>
Levinas presented twenty-three Talmudic readings in the context of the
<em>Colloques des intellectuels juifs de langue fran&ccedil;aise</em>.
Ethan Kleinberg has recently discussed four of these readings with
acute attention to the growth of Jewish themes in Levinas&rsquo;
philosophical project (Kleinberg 2021). It bears noting that, in 1957,
at the first meeting of the colloquium, Levinas merely participated in
the debates. Salomon Malka reminds us of one of his profoundly
hermeneutic observations around that time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Judaism is not a religion, the word doesn&rsquo;t exist in Hebrew; it
is much more than that, it is an <em>understanding of being</em>. The
Jews introduced into history the idea of hope and that of a
future&hellip;. Moreover, Jews have the sentiment that their
obligations toward the other person come before their obligations in
regard to God. (Malka 2002: 42, my trans., emph. added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This remark already shows us three important things. First, that
Judaism might be an &ldquo;understanding of being&rdquo; implies that
it can encompasse ontology. Second, that Judaism was profoundly aware
of finitude as both precarity and mortality. By extension, the
hermeneutic life of Jewish traditions is an unfinished, ongoing
process. Third, that our obligations to other persons come before
duties toward God (from rituals to norms), and occasionally abrogate
these duties, denotes a secularizing <em lang="fr">&eacute;lan</em>,
or better, a human-oriented dimension within Judaism. This helps us
grasp how it is that Levinas found resources in Heidegger&rsquo;s
hermeneutics, both utilizing and criticizing its concepts and
method.</p>

<p>
The relationship between Levinas&rsquo; thought, its Jewish
influences, and phenomenological philosophy has given rise to multiple
evaluations. Martin Kavka argues that &ldquo;Levinas understood both
Judaism and Western philosophy as engaging in structurally similar
forms of thinking&rdquo; (Kavka 2010: 20&ndash;21). He situates the
structural similarity in that &ldquo;both [these intellectual
corpuses] consist of texts that point to what cannot be brought to
presence&rdquo; and consequently work between the dimensions of
reference, explanation, and hermeneutic pre-comprehension (cf. Ouaknin
1993: 225 [1995:
 155&ndash;156]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup>
 To be sure, for European philosophy, the transcendence of the Good is
often integrated into epistemological projects (e.g., Descartes).
Against Kavka&rsquo;s claim, Lapidot emphasizes foundational
differences: a method that departs decisively &ldquo;from
vision-based, objectifying thought &lsquo;reveal[s] it as implanted
in&hellip;a forgotten experience from which it lives&rsquo;&rdquo;
(2021: 8). Moreover, a foundation in axiology, or a thinking of
relational values, is a notable Jewish contribution to philosophies of
language and intersubjectivity. However, this foundation arises first
as voice&mdash;as teaching. That means that the tradition unfolds
around the auditory register rather than the visual one, the way I
carry a voice within me as opposed to constituting something visually,
at a distance.</p>

<p>
Kavka and Michael Fagenblat certainly recognize the profound
historicity of this dimension of Jewish thought: indeed, &ldquo;it is
not clear&hellip;that&hellip;a &lsquo;new direction&rsquo; in Jewish
philosophy is [ever] really new&rdquo; (Kavka 2010: 21). Fagenblat
examines the hermeneutic extension that <em>Otherwise than Being</em>
gives to <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, and both commentators argue
that Levinas&rsquo; increasingly critical stance toward the
epistemological and foundationalist aspects of Husserlian
phenomenology motivated him to expand his hermeneutic recourse both to
Heidegger&rsquo;s <em lang="de">Existenzphilosophie</em> and toward
Jewish thought, including Neo-Platonic currents and Maimonides
(Fagenblat 2010:
 97&ndash;110).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup>
 But it should be emphasized that Levinas&rsquo; hermeneutics begins
well before <em>Otherwise than Being</em>. His reinterpretation of
being-in-the-world, the meaning of facticity, the creation of a
dwelling, and even his reading of <em lang="grc">eros</em> and the
family in 1961 entail interpretive choices, indebted to at least two
significant hermeneutic themes: Heidegger&rsquo;s interpretation of
our pre-comprehension of existence and Rosenzweig&rsquo;s approach to
Jewish life in <em>The Star of Redemption</em> (SE 1921 [2005]).</p>

<p>
In 1961, Levinas wrote that Rosenzweig&rsquo;s <em>Star of
Redemption</em> was &ldquo;too often present in this book
[<em>Totality and Infinity</em>] to be cited&rdquo; (TI 28), and
numerous are the commentaries on the presence of Rosenzweig in
Levinas&rsquo;
 work.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>
 It is important to recall that Rosenzweig had been a scholar of Hegel
until the experience of the trenches in World War I motivated his
substituting the limited community forged by <em lang="de">Sprachdenken</em>
for Hegel&rsquo;s idealist political
philosophy; universalizing dialectics gave way to an existential
relationality that preserved singularity through dialogue. The
<em>Star of Redemption</em> is a complex work analyzing the lived
times of Jews and Christians, with a view to conceiving a certain
extension of Judaism via Christianity over the course of their
histories. At the core of each one lay a task and a profound, if
disparate, intuition: a <em lang="de">Sprachdenken</em> (dialogical
thinking) engendered by a revelation. Peter Eli Gordon has argued that
Rosenzweig is &ldquo;a post-Nietzschean philosopher&rdquo;, a
post-death of God thinker who thereby opened this &ldquo;God&rdquo; to
relationality, however enigmatic. Gordon observes that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
like Heidegger, Rosenzweig&rsquo;s new thinking denies that human
meaning is intelligible independent of a life- and other-context.
Temporal hermeneutics thus replaces the transcendental search for
essence. (Gordon 2003: 185)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same could be said of Levinas. Since he conceives temporality in
human terms (as opposed to eternity or <em>stasis</em>), meaning
itself can only be approached in light of time. Readers familiar with
Rosenzweig&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em lang="de">neues Denken</em>&rdquo; may
know that he situated one of the principal hermeneutic differences
between Judaism and Christianity in the way their theologies
&ldquo;temporalized&rdquo;, with Christianity being oriented around
the life and death of the incarnate God, an event whose occurrence
lies in the historic past, and Judaism, as historically
future-oriented, i.e., ongoingly awaiting the messiah.</p>

<p>
Levinas took up the question of meaning and temporality in a way
somewhat different from both Rosenzweig and Heidegger. In 1961, as we
have seen, his phenomenology of hospitality proceeded on the
present-time of love of life in the world and the momentary encounter
called the face-to-face. However, the place where he explicitly uses
the term &ldquo;phenomenology&rdquo; therein concerns precisely a
secularized messianic future. This is the chapter entitled
&ldquo;Phenomenology of Eros&rdquo;, which deploys &ldquo;a
phenomenological model for the ultimate term of our desire&rdquo;, as
Fagenblat puts it (2010: 93). To this Lapidot adds, the family flowing
out of <em lang="grc">eros</em> would be &ldquo;beyond the finite
individual&hellip;the infinite individual being the &lsquo;ultimate
structure&rsquo; of being, &lsquo;produced as multiple and as split
into Same and Other&rsquo; (TI 308)&rdquo;&mdash;this would be the we
of the family (Lapidot 2021: 15).</p>

<p>
The argument would be this: before <em lang="grc">eros</em> is
sublimated in civil society, <em lang="grc">eros</em> and the family
bring to light our concern with others in their particularity and
difference, independently of their biological or social roles. We can
take the family as a &ldquo;model&rdquo; here, in the Frankfurt
School&rsquo;s sense of &ldquo;an intellectual
construction&hellip;[whose elements] are borrowed from empirical
experiences that have already shown their worth&rdquo; (Broch 2008:
43). The phenomenology of <em lang="grc">eros</em> opens a future of
&ldquo;election&rdquo; within the family and perhaps beyond
it. Despite the apparent heterosexism of his formulations, Levinas
introduces an abiding concern for singularity and uniqueness by
defining the figure of paternity as the possibility of electing each
son in his specificity, just as the latter may serve (and clash with)
his brothers. Consistent with a model, the family is both figure and
reality. It serves Levinas&rsquo; hermeneutic secularization of
messianic future-time, inspired by Rosenzweig, through the succession
of generations.  Interestingly, <em lang="grc">eros</em> unfolds
&ldquo;phenomenologically&rdquo; in much the same way eas did the
proto-experience of the &ldquo;there is&rdquo; (<em lang="fr">il y
a</em>). That is, it unfolds in a darkness overlooked by
phenomenologies that rely on light and the universal evidence that
light enables (TI 256). There would consequently be a neglected
underside to the phenomenological account of constitution, which
precedes and accompanies intentionality&rsquo;s encounter with objects
and world. And <em>that</em> requires hermeneutics, as Moati observes
in <em>Levinas and the Night of Being</em> (2012 [2017]). <em>For
further discussion of Jewish hermeneutics, see
 <a href="supplements.html#SupHerJewPhi">Supplement S.5 on Hermeneutics and Jewish Philosophy</a></em>.</p>
 
<p>
Like Fagenblat, scholars from David Banon to Marc-Alain Ouaknin to
Sebbah have explored the hermeneutic dimension of Levinas&rsquo;
thought, even beyond his Talmudic readings that delve into the
many-voiced debates between the rabbis of the Mishnah and the Gemara
(the oldest and subsequent transcriptions of Jewish oral traditions)
(Banon
 1987).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>
 As Ouaknin points out, in the case of Talmudic and Biblical
hermeneutics, Levinas always considered the eminence of a
book&mdash;what defines it as &ldquo;the Book&rdquo;&mdash;to be less
its themes than its <em>structure</em>. Levinas focuses &ldquo;on the
structure of the Book of books inasmuch as it allows for exegesis
[hermeneutics], and on its unique status of containing more than it
 contains&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Hermeneutics is thus <em>engendered</em> by excesses of potential
meaning over senses already printed on the page, or even discerned by
the reception traditions of the work. It would thus be the specific
architecture of the book that conditions its reception. Moreover, the
parallelisms that we have seen&mdash;between the Saying and the Said
<em>and</em> between temporal diachrony and synchrony&mdash;are also
found at the literary level in Biblical and Talmudic texts, with their
openness to ongoing interpretation. Levinas even equates
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo; with the call of the text to <em>each</em>
reader or listener, who thereby becomes responsible for its
interpretation. &ldquo;The Revelation as calling to the unique within
me is the significance particular to the signifying of the
Revelation&rdquo; of the text, which is understood as dialogical to
its core. Here we see the structural analogy between the call of the
other and my response that begins as Saying, as opening to words
addressed. Levinas adds,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the totality of the true is constituted from the contribution of
multiple people, the uniqueness of each act of listening carrying the
secret of the text; the voice of the Revelation, as
inflected&hellip;by each person&rsquo;s ear, would be necessary to the
&lsquo;Whole&rsquo; of the truth. (BTV 133&ndash;134)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hermeneutic truth here becomes the responsibility of an <em>open</em>
community, as much as an invitation to participation extended to each
possible listener. That is why Levinas could urge that Scripture be
understood as summoning the reader to respond as readily as the
subject was called to respond, i.e., through situations of
responsibility. All of these express an ethical investiture that
results in words offered. The here and now of scriptural voices and
reading stands analogous to the here and now of the face-to-face
encounter and the fact that memory occurs by definition in the
present.</p>

<p>
Levinas&rsquo; hermeneutics might nevertheless be deemed immanent,
i.e., concerning one book and one community. Although commentators
like Leora Batnitzky find in Levinas a project for a modern politics,
and thus for universality, others are skeptical about her claim.
Trigano objects that Levinas&rsquo; ethics unfolds out of a sort of
non-site, starting with the category of the singular. &ldquo;For
Levinas&rdquo;, he argues,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is ethically imperative to think the singular in order that the
horizon of the other person arise. The universal is, in effect, a
dangerous game that can lead to totality and to the negation of the
other person. To decide in favor of the singular is to avoid such a
development</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and with it, a closed politics (Trigano 2002: 173). Froese (2020)
argues that we can derive a utopian politics from Levinas&rsquo;
hermeneutics, provided that we understand the levels of subjectivity
he explores, including the affective and pre-conscious level in which
original intersubjectivity is born. This requires mobilizing a genetic
phenomenological method. And perhaps for that reason, it has been
largely missed by left and liberal readers who see in Levinas &ldquo;a
pure ideological fantasy&rdquo; (Froese 2020: 4), one that readily
aligns with neoliberalism. As Froese insists, however,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the social bond between subjects is not predicated on a common
experience or shared horizon of meaning, but simply [on] the
experience of the self, as a self is necessarily mediated in and
through others. (2020: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Without this understanding, there is little way to mobilize
Levinas&rsquo; philosophy as a critique of politics.</p>

<p>
In sum, the hermeneutic and phenomenological turn that Levinas gives
to Husserl and Heidegger has led to debates about the relationship
between an immanent hermeneutics and one concerned with politics as
the sphere of the universal. Herzog argues in the same vein as Froese,
for a Jewish and Levinasian universalism, provided we accept her
thesis that ethics and politics mutually interrupt each
other&mdash;with ethics urging us toward a &ldquo;surplus of
responsibility&rdquo; and politics representing the inescapable
context and risk that besets responsibility. To demonstrate her claim,
Herzog engages an extensive study of the politics of the law as
debated in the Talmud and presented in Levinas&rsquo; Talmudic
readings (Herzog 2020: 38&ndash;57, 94&ndash;119). These questions
imply discussions about politics <em>in our time</em> from which
Levinas might have refrained in his time, in the wake of the Shoah,
when politics seemed less important than questions of the future of
Jewish communities. Be that as it may, even objections that claim to
be phenomenological and <em>not</em> ideological (Drabinski 2011: 41)
fail to emphasize that phenomenology itself contains a Cartesian
egology, with transcendental and lifeworld egoic layers, as well as a
psychological level derived from the embodied experience of
affectivity, including intersubjective affects.</p>

<p>
Much of the debate about Levinas&rsquo; politics unfolded successively
in France and then in the English-speaking world. Michel Haar (1991:
530) asked of Levinas whether his ethics could really unfold outside
of any site, outside of any positive reciprocity, and outside all
objectivation (cited by Trigano 2002: 175, note 79). Trigano
criticized Levinas, urging that the dialectical relationship between
singular experience and universal meaning (and institutions) implies
that philosophy should have a minimal relationship to politics
(Trigano 2002: 176). On Trigano&rsquo;s account, it follows that
Levinas&rsquo; hermeneutics only partly responded to Jews&rsquo;
post-war need for the universalization of their experience, at a human
level encompassing both theory and political practice (Trigano 2002:
176). This does not contradict Batnitzky&rsquo;s reading, which
considers Levinas&rsquo; <em>&oelig;uvre</em> as a whole. But it can
be argued that universalization in Levinas&rsquo; ethics remains
largely formal. On this question turns the important matter of what it
means to develop a Jewish <em>philosophy</em> today.</p>

<p>
Numerous are the objections to what we could call Levinas&rsquo;
&ldquo;genetic hermeneutics&rdquo;. Terry Eagleton (2009), Slavoj
&#381;i&#382;ek (2005), and Simon Critchley (2004), among others, have
read Levinas as though the face-to-face encounter represented a
retreat into private life, without reference to or concern for social
and political existence. Froese speaks, by contrast, in terms of
&ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; (2020: 11), echoing Levinas&rsquo; own
arguments that the social-structural dimension of our relationship to
alterity is itself impoverished when we neglect the
&ldquo;pre-subjective plane of analysis&rdquo;, made possible through
genetic phenomenology (2020: 11). Sebbah (2018a, 40&ndash;46) also
emphasizes Levinas&rsquo; hermeneutic argument for the
&ldquo;separation&rdquo; that defines the subject in the world; this
must be taken seriously throughout. Stated otherwise, the subject is
in the world yet not wholly of the world:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the true interiority is nothing of the world and certainly not as an
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; that would be &ldquo;situatable&rdquo; in that
world. Hope and responsibility&mdash;when nothing of the world remains
standing, or only remains standing in the crude light of
wretchedness&mdash;resist because they are neither of the world, nor
of being. Hope and responsibility whereby, in a sense, interiority is
evasion or escape itself. (Sebbah 2018a, 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="ThiParIllPol">2.4.5 The Third Party, Illeity, and Politics</h4>

<p>
Derrida once called <em>Totality and Infinity</em> a &ldquo;treatise
on hospitality&rdquo; (1997 [1999: 21]). As we have seen,
Levinas&rsquo; 1961 work approached being as the conflict of wills
that persist in their existence, like the philosophical
tradition&rsquo;s concept of <em>conatus essendi</em> (the will to
persist in being). Neutral existence or the <em>there-is</em> (<em lang="fr">il
y a</em>) denoted indeterminate nocturnal being, which
gives way to the diurnal being called &ldquo;the elemental&rdquo;
(sunlight, winds, rain). As noted, being in Levinas thus entails both
dynamic forces and a conception of natural processes. Hospitality,
also called &ldquo;metaphysical desire&rdquo; (TI 33), cannot be
grounded on such forces, much less on a conception of the will,
whether based on drives of self-preservation or self-enhancement. And,
because hospitality is elicited by the other&mdash;and is
non-reciprocal&mdash;it does not presuppose a prior social-contractual
exchange, much less moral sentiments or innate emotive capacities for
empathy or compassion. If it did, there would be no question of
escaping a so-called natural order of existence.</p>

<p>
That is why Levinas&mdash;aware that the concept of nature itself has
a debated history&mdash;characterizes our response to the other, which
by 1974 is also called &ldquo;pre-natural signification&rdquo; (OBBE
68). He now argues in phenomenological terms,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[i]n renouncing intentionality as a guiding thread toward the <em lang="grc">eidos</em>
[formal structure] of the psyche&hellip;our
analysis will follow sensibility in its pre-natural signification to
the maternal, where, in proximity [to what is not itself],
signification signifies <em>before</em> it gets bent into
<em>perseverance in being</em> in the midst of a Nature. (OBBE 68,
emph. added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;The maternal&rdquo;, here, is a figure for the affective
experience of bearing within oneself what is not solely oneself. The
point is ultimately that intersubjective sensibility, inaugurated by
the approach of the other person, eludes the &ldquo;mechanistic
causality&rdquo; observed in natural processes, as well as the
&ldquo;natural necessity&rdquo; attributed to instincts. We shall see
shortly what this implies for the famous &ldquo;Third
party&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In order to develop further the idea of signification as pre-natural,
as pre-conative, Levinas found himself compelled to develop further
concepts. In 1961, he had referred to our desire for the other as
&ldquo;religion&rdquo; (&ldquo;the bond&hellip;established between the
same and the other&rdquo; ) and as &ldquo;transascendence&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Transcendence, like desire and inadequation, is necessarily a
transascendence&rdquo; (respectively TI 41, 35), which underscores the
immediacy and even sensuousness of the response. By 1974, Levinas
calls the value and dignity of responding to another person,
&ldquo;illeity&rdquo;. He defines illeity as &ldquo;a neologism formed
with <em>il</em> (he) or <em>ille</em>, [whereby alterity] indicates a
way of concerning me without entering into conjunction with
me&rdquo;&mdash;without conjunction with me, whether in thought or in
act (OBBE 12; also 13&ndash;16, 147&ndash;162). Beyond the concept of
the third party introduced already in <em>Totality and Infinity</em>,
&ldquo;illeity&rdquo; also refers to something absolute, even divine,
in the other person. We can see here how our responsibility to the
other thus stands in the place of our responsibility to God, or simply
evokes it, which is a crucial hermeneutic dimension of Judaism.</p>

<p>
The question remains, as it did already in <em>Totality and
Infinity</em>: how does an investiture of this affective intensity
pass into rationality? Consequently, how does embodied affectivity
play a transcendental role, as condition of possibility, in the
experience of temporal interruption, also known as responsibility,
i.e., the moment of my responding? Would responsibility and
transcendence not thereupon enter the ongoing flow of time
(transcendental consciousness) and be confounded with being as
totality? The relationship between the transcendental and the
empirical has caused much ink to flow. For example, some have argued
that Kant&rsquo;s late-published <em>Doctrine of Virtue</em> (1797)
set forth avenues for empirical illustrations of the transcendental,
categorial imperative (see for example Smit &amp; Timmons
2013). Indeed, ongoing debates have not decided the question of
whether the Husserlian temporal transcendental, called inner
time-consciousness, is or is not open in its purity to description. To
be sure, the transcendental flow is a condition of possibility of
empirical experience in Husserl. As to Levinas, in both the 1961 work
and that of 1974, we find that the &ldquo;third
party&rdquo;&mdash;denoting both other people and the reprise of
intentionality&mdash;similarly &ldquo;looks at me through the eyes of
the other&rdquo; (TI 213). Here the passage to reason, social
existence, and objective time occurs because the temporal lapse
Levinas calls &ldquo;diachrony&rdquo; is invariably resorbed, if in
part, by intentional consciousness. Intersubjective affectivity and,
in a sense, the body itself thus play the role of a transcendental in
Levinas, who also recognizes that affects are always on the verge of
becoming intentional (PCIT Appendix 12); in short, objects of
empirical consciousness.</p>

<p>
In like manner, responsibility and fraternity, which are formulated by
1974 as the other-in-the-same, still <em>leave a trace</em> in social
relations. The trace is mnemonic and bodily, as indicated, and it
emerges from affective relationality, its condition of possibility. We
find it in our concern for restorative justice, even for a more modest
equity. This empirical concern for justice does not erase the
Hobbesian conception of drives in human collectivities. The trace
introduces ambiguity into existence or being; it allows exceptional
acts of generosity to phenomenalize. In temporal terms, diachrony
crosses through synchrony. Or, as Herzog puts it, the world, although
chaotic, is also the site in which responsibility proves visible
(Herzog 2020: 40&ndash;42).</p>

<p>
By 1974, then, the ambiguity of the passive temporality that Levinas
likens to ageing and describes as &ldquo;diachrony&rdquo; (OBBE 54)
relative to the all-structuring flow of time-consciousness has become
more marked. Levinas inquires, &ldquo;[d]oes a face abide in
representation <em>and</em> in proximity; is it community <em>and</em>
difference?&rdquo; (OBBE 154, emph. added). The answer appears to be
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;, albeit at two metaphoric levels. The face,
conceived as representation, <em>fixes</em> the dynamism of the face
as expression; representation <em>fixes</em> the dynamism of affective
investiture that arises from the aforementioned intersubjective
transcendental. Adopting a different terminology, Levinas writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he third party introduces a contradiction into the Saying whose
signification before the other until then went in one direction
[toward the singular other]. [The third] is of itself the limit of
responsibility and the birth of the question: What do I have to do
with justice? A question of consciousness. (OBBE 157)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When we return to a philosophy of consciousness and representation,
the indispensable figure of the trace that Levinas has introduced
becomes attenuated, if not suspect. As we have seen, in order to
confront eventual skepticism about the trace, he <em>enacts</em> his
witness in a literary here and now. His figural performance points not
toward another world or to a being different from that discussed by
Heidegger, so much as to the intensities and vulnerability of
pre-conscious affectivity. By textually enacting the immediacy of
suffering, Levinas appears to offer a poetics of the inexpressible
(Anckaert 2020: 66&ndash;68). Nevertheless, since he also demands that
we reflect on intersubjectivity from a standpoint outside the
face-to-face encounter, his work gives us a double task: the as-if of
his enacted here-and-now <em>and</em> the development of
conceptualization. Justice similarly opens to the question,
&ldquo;what have I to do with justice?&rdquo; and even to the
representation of justice. To be sure, this two-sided justice entails
an additional explanatory move that Levinas <em>cannot</em> make. This
move would have to account for why third parties insist that
&ldquo;I&rdquo; also receive just treatment. That is a question
requiring the systems perspective, outside the now-moment in which
&ldquo;I&rdquo; emerge and enact my witness, affectively invested by
alterity (OBBE 158). &ldquo;[I]t is only thanks to God that as a
subject in incomparable with the other, I am approached as an other by
the others, that is &lsquo;for myself&rsquo;&rdquo; (OBBE 158, trans
modified for fluency with the French).</p>

<p>
The equalizing situation from which comparison, justice, and
normativity can be <em>deduced</em> is thus beyond Levinas&rsquo;
immediate concern (Herzog 2020, 42&ndash;44). Such a situation is that
of objective, or third-person, consciousness. This is, for example,
the approach adopted by Hegel in the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>,
which he calls the &ldquo;for-us&rdquo; as readers, or the externalist
standpoint (Hegel PG &sect;25). Levinas simply marks this
standpoint, with his expression &ldquo;thanks to God&rdquo;, where it
is already obvious that &ldquo;God&rdquo; is not a being. Although
commentators differ on the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;thanks
to God&rdquo;, it is repeated in the liturgy, &ldquo;<em>Baruch
haShem</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Baruch atah Adonai</em> (blessed be
the Name or blessed be <em>Adonai</em>)&rdquo;. Like other terms and
expressions, Levinas &ldquo;translates&rdquo; the externalist
standpoint into the language of prayer and liturgy. In his subsequent
use of the expression, Levinas sets these words between quotation
marks.</p>

<p>
Franck interprets the 1974 figure of illeity as bespeaking the
<em>force</em> and value of proximity. It is the sheer distance of a
&ldquo;God&rdquo; that is never a being but &ldquo;in whose trace the
Thou or the face that intends and assigns me signifies&rdquo; (Franck
2008: 109, my trans.). Marc Faessler ties the word &ldquo;God&rdquo;
together with the Saying because it is the trace of an excess that
Levinas also calls &ldquo;glory (<em>kavod</em>)&rdquo;. This
maintains human practice as an open system: &ldquo;the anarchy of God
thus opens to a &lsquo;saying God otherwise [<em>Autrement dire
Dieu</em>]&rsquo;&rdquo; (Faessler 2021: 21).</p>

<p>
When conceived spatially, illeity points to an indeterminate place or
source, the other always already motivating my saying. Taking a
further step, Levinas <em>extends</em> illeity to the possibility of
my receiving justice from other people. He writes, &ldquo;thanks to
God [<em>Il</em>]&hellip;I am approached as an other by the
others&rdquo; (OBBE 158). But, again, even if universal justice is
&ldquo;thanks to God&rdquo;, <em>this</em> God <em>is not</em> part of
being (OBBE 162)&mdash;a claim familiar to both negative theology and
to Maimonides&rsquo; approach to God through human action. Levinas is
aware of the paradox of human justice being a gift from that which
cannot be part of being, in which that justice nevertheless occurs. He
knows the theological reversion to <em>praxis</em> toward which
Maimonides gestures at the end of his <em>Guide of the Perplexed</em>:
&ldquo;The only positive knowledge of God <em>of which man is
capable</em> is knowledge of the attributes of action&rdquo;
(Fagenblat 2010:
 113),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 and this is not ultimately knowledge. As Levinas puts it, &ldquo;to
know God is to know what must be done&rdquo; (DF 17). It is thus not
to know some being or even to erect a regulative idea (Froese 2020:
10). The dignity and force of illeity share an important connection
with what we might call our <em>enacting</em> God through
responsibility to the other and through justice. Another word for this
is &ldquo;holiness&rdquo;, whether this comes from me in the form of
the Saying or from the others as justice toward me.</p>

<p>
Here lies the point at which a reading begins that bridges the
philosophical and the religious dimensions of Levinas&rsquo; thought.
Indeed, as he put it in his 1966 article &ldquo;Infinity&rdquo; (AT
53&ndash;76):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
An entire strain of contemporary philosophy, setting out from the
irreducibility of the interpersonal to relations of objectivity,
thematization, and knowledge, is situated in the religious tradition
of the idea of the infinite&hellip;even when it expresses itself in a
deliberately and rigorously <em>atheistic</em> way. (AT 76, emph.
added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This suggests that, whether we approach it atheistically or
religiously, the tension between interpersonal relations and
objectivity implies the third party and by extension a social
relationality that is indissociable from justice and politics. But it
is not clear that Levinas ever decided whether politics implied above
all war or the means toward a peaceable State. In his late essay
&ldquo;Peace and Proximity&rdquo; (1984 [1996: 161&ndash;169]),
Levinas expressed an attitude surprisingly favorable to the idea of
the politics which, when the State is a liberal one, evinces palpable
aspects of the trace of responsibility in its policies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not without importance to know&mdash;and this is perhaps the
European experience of the twentieth century&mdash;whether the
egalitarian and just State [and its politics] in which the European is
fulfilled&hellip;proceeds from a war of all against all&mdash;or from
the irreducible responsibility of the one for the other. (in Rolland
[ed.] 1984: 346, my trans.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jared Highlen (2021) develops a coherent argument on the basis of the
distinction, introduced in the same 1984 article, between &ldquo;the
peace of the State&rdquo; and a peace founded on separation&mdash;the
separation-participation of the subject in its world but not reducible
to it. Highlen, like Herzog, argues that, because the third looks at
me through the eyes of the other, &ldquo;politics is involved from the
very beginning&rdquo; (Highlen 2021: 326). With this claim, the
face-to-face entails a measure of violence, by excluding other others
for whom I may be responsible. But this violence is transitional, just
as the violence of politics, which shows itself when &ldquo;politics
[is] left to itself&rdquo; (2021: 328). Highlen concludes that on its
own terms &ldquo;the political appears not as the
necessary&hellip;dilution of the ethical obligation, but rather as its
fulfillment&rdquo; (2021: 329). <em>See
 <a href="supplements.html#SupPolSta">Supplement S.6 on Politics and the State</a>
 for further discussion</em></p>

<p>
Herzog (2020) has recently strengthened this argument, urging that
Levinas&rsquo; Talmudic readings provide the indispensable connection
to what would be his politics. She points out that politics provide
his proto-ethics with its visibility and with historic sites.
Consequently, politics may be criticized in the name of
responsibility, or ethics, but politics also moderates the radicality
of ethical responsibility. Although Talmudic politics concerns Jewish
communities, it often focuses on relations with other nations, as well
as economic issues, from property disputes to equitable salaries. As
Levinas himself observes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the Rabbis cannot forget the organizing principle of Rome and its law
[pluralism under Empire]! They therefore anticipate, with remarkable
independence of spirit, modern political philosophy [including the
philosophy of colonized states against imperial ones]. Whatever its
order, the City already insures the rights of human beings against
their fellow men. (BTV 183)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Key here are the words &ldquo;whatever its order&rdquo;. In the
concept of order is already included a minimal protection of rights of
human persons with regard to their fellows. This is a universal
principle with specific instantiations in function of the State. We
find such pluralism in the Talmud, which also carries the
&ldquo;secular&rdquo; intuition that it is the <em>human</em> tribunal
that should replace divine justice, which is not forthcoming (Herzog
2020: 44). That does not mean that Talmudic justice is not itself a
collection of varied responses to what is a just action or law. Herzog
nevertheless adds the insight that, in the Talmud,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
politics is not defined by its modern philosophical attributes, it is
neither a monopoly of power, nor the guardian of individuals&rsquo;
natural rights, nor a natural expression of the people. [Politics] is
defined [above all] as concern and care for the peoples&rsquo; hunger.
(Herzog 2020: 40)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This neither denies the plurality of voices nor the potential
universality of the singular in the Talmud. It emphasizes the
&ldquo;original peace&rdquo;, or intersubjective responsibility that
gives rise to good politics. To be sure, Levinas is aware that any
&ldquo;organized political order&hellip;can become unjust and even
violent for its subjects&rdquo; (Anckaert 2020: 72). This includes
liberal orders based on contractualism. Again, Levinas is ultimately
neither a liberal nor a conservative; insofar as Talmudic debate
provides him material for a situated politics, the latter proves both
pluralistic and context-dependent. <em>See
 <a href="supplements.html#SupJusSta">Supplement S.7 on Justice and the State</a>
 for further discussion.</em></p>

<p>
The dual preoccupation with justice, understood as righteousness, and
justice understood as civic virtue, suggests that together Athens and
Jerusalem give us a comprehensive approach to politics, as both
practice and ideal. Drabinski and Fred Moten have questioned this
claim to universality (Drabinski 2011: 165&ndash;196), and with it the
category of &ldquo;being-Jewish&rdquo;, in favor of an emphasis on the
passivity intrinsic to a <em>multiplicity</em> of human situations,
including race, ethnicity, and gender. Yet, again, it is fair to argue
that Levinas is primarily concerned with embodied passivity, which he
approaches as a transcendental condition of possibility, as we have
seen. Moten takes a different, Sartrean tack, emphasizing that
passivity has multiple meanings. It is notably observed in our
relations to <em>things</em> rather than to persons, thereby
spontaneously diminishing their humanity. He adds that the Bible and
the Greeks, when presented as &ldquo;the whole world&rdquo;, carry
thought toward a teleological reflection that expresses an
unacknowledged European <em>malaise</em>, wherein the non-European
precisely receives the status of object (2018: 9, 11).</p>

<p>
Mendel Kranz has recently traced Levinas&rsquo; relationship to this
malaise, as also to the evolving Zionist project. He observes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[W]hat these documents [studies] suggest, is that Levinas was
simultaneously waging an ideological battle against the territorial
and national codes of the Zionist project and attempting to articulate
something of an alternative. (Kranz 2019: 316)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a different vein, Ephraim Meir proposes a
&ldquo;trans-different&rdquo; conversation between Gandhi and Levinas,
acknowledging that the latter would not unequivocally embrace
<em>ahimse</em>, non-violence&mdash;including in post-colonial
situations. Meir cites Judith Butler&rsquo;s Levinas-inspired claim
that all lives should be seen as grievable (Butler 2020), which
entails in its specific way a serious concern with human
interdependence (Meir 2021: 10&ndash;12). <em>See

<h2 id="N3RecDevHumEdu"> 3. Recent Developments: Humanism and Education</h2>

<h3 id="HumEdu">3.1 Humanism and Education</h3>

<p>
A unique feature of Levinas&rsquo; thought consists in his nuanced
return to a humanism&mdash;&ldquo;of the other person&rdquo;.
Extending his conception of humanism past what Levinas defined as its
four-part nature&mdash;&ldquo;respect for the person&hellip;; a
blossoming of human nature, of intelligence in science, creativity in
Art, and pleasure in daily life&rdquo; (DF 277)&mdash;toward a Jewish
humanism, Claire Katz raises the question of education. In her book,
<em>Levinas and the Crisis of Humanism</em>, Katz discusses the
multiple senses of this &ldquo;other&rdquo; humanism in light of the
decline of classical (Christian) humanism, and given the challenges
posed to it by both structuralism and poststructuralism. Following
Levinas&rsquo; 1973 &ldquo;Antihumanism and Education&rdquo; (Levinas
1973 [DF 277&ndash;288]), Katz traces a dual genealogy, that of the
loss of legitimacy of Western humanism as philosophy and ethos and
that, in a sense more significant, of the demise of &ldquo;social
effectiveness and its intellectual meaning&rdquo; (Katz 2013:
117).</p>

<p>
Robin Podolsky has extended the question of an education in
responsibility, to the creation in 2017 of &ldquo;Sumud
[steadfastness] Camp&rdquo;. This site in the Hebron hills was
conceived as a locus regrouping diaspora Jews, Israeli Jews, and
Palestinians in a community designed as &ldquo;a kind of Levinasian
space&rdquo; (Podolsky 2019: 1). As Podolsky emphasizes, such
projects</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
are experiments in building a political program from the grass roots
up, based on&hellip;investments in one another&rsquo;s well-being that
cross national and religious divides. Their <em>praxis</em> begins
with the face-to-face. (2019: 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="LevPhiEna">3.2 Levinas&rsquo; Philosophy and Enactivism</h3>

<p>
The term &ldquo;enactivism&rdquo; denotes developments in
phenomenology and those cognitive sciences that together date largely
from the work of Francesco Varela and Evan Thompson in the 1990s
(1991, 2001). Indebted to the evolving reception of the work of the
French philosopher Merleau-Ponty (1908&ndash;1961), enactivism
conjoins phenomenology as first-person experience with third-person
descriptions from the cognitive sciences. It accepts Heidegger and
Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s conceptions of bodies being already in a world,
their world. It takes seriously the existential quality of embodiment
and has recently been interested in embodied intersubjectivity
(Thompson 2001). Whereas many from the school of enactivism have
approached the work of Levinas with skepticism (Koubov&aacute; 2014;
Di Paolo et al. 2018), deeming it dualistic and doubting that
encounters with others might escape cognition and unfold at a purely
affective level, enactivists have nevertheless not engaged Levinas
extensively. One of the exceptions to this is Sarah Pawlett-Jackson
(2021), who argues that singular experiences of the approach of the
other&mdash;as can be found in both Sartre and Levinas&mdash;are
insufficient to clarifying intersubjectivity among three or more
people (Pawlett-Jackson 2021).</p>

<p>
At the same time, Fabrice M&eacute;tais and Mario Villalobos have
countered that Levinas&rsquo; work can be instrumental in developing a
<em>bona fide</em> enactivist, embodied ethics (M&eacute;tais &amp;
Villalobos 2021, 2022). Close to the work of cognitivist, Tom Froese
(2009), M&eacute;tais and Villalobos argue that enactivism has fallen
into the trap of a third-person intersubjectivity (2022: 327). The
latter consists in focusing on intersubjectivity as a social
aggregate, a site of shared existence invariably tied up with ontology
or groups describable in neutral rather than ethical language. The
authors define this as an approach to &ldquo;distinctional
otherness&rdquo;&mdash;the way natural language speaks in the
third-person of &ldquo;the one and the other&rdquo; as though they
were objects (2022: 329). A different modality of otherness focuses on
the second-person (thou, you), and thus on &ldquo;the differences
between agents or <em>subjects</em>&rdquo; (2022: 329).</p>

<p>
All these conceptions of otherness have value and find their use in
enactivist cognitive science. Levinas&rsquo; philosophy offers a way
to expand this approach. His conception of otherness is ethical,
practical, and therefore &ldquo;neither an ontological category nor an
epistemic limitation in the realm of beings&rdquo; (M&eacute;tais
&amp; Villalobos 2022: 330). This distinction undergirds what
enactivists call &ldquo;participatory sense-making&rdquo;, which
include phenomena flowing from the face-to-face relation and networks
of enactive agents. Their argument thus addresses
Pawlett-Jackson&rsquo;s objection concerning interconnected selves and
others.</p>

<p>
Considered together, Pawlett-Jackson, M&eacute;tais and Villalobos
arguably represent a new direction for enactivism, which has already
shown important potential for self-correction and expansion. They
argue that second-person perspectives on sociality are often
presupposed even before the question of otherness arises, including in
terms of ethics. This maintains alterity at one remove from the
encounters that Levinas describes, and which come to light in the
approach and call of another person. The upshot of more traditional
enactivism is a horizontal conception of sociality, often limited to
epistemic questions. As M&eacute;tais and Villalobos see it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the way they [enactivists] use the concept of irreducible otherness,
as the otherness of the other <em>subject</em>, does not imply any
modification of the process through which sense is produced
(sense-making) and thus <em>does not indicate any breach</em> [of
self-contained consciousness] beyond the sphere of constitution and
ontology. (2022: 331)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As indicated, this concept of otherness overlooks the ethical
dimension of sense-making, which arises, for Levinas, in the immediate
encounter with an other, who is both embodied and carries their own
perspective. M&eacute;tais and Villalobos argue that enactivists have
treated the pair, knowability and unknowability, in light of a more
conventional object- versus subject-otherness.</p>

<h2 id="ConRem">4. Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>
Commentators have differed on the comparative importance of
Levinas&rsquo; major works, <em>Totality and Infinity</em> and
<em>Otherwise than Being</em>. Some have urged that we see in them two
sides of a single coin: that of responsibility experienced in the
face-to-face encounter and that of the insistence of an affective
trace that interrupts flowing time as conceived by classical
phenomenology (Peperzak 1993: 7). Other commentators have argued that
<em>Otherwise than Being</em> is Levinas&rsquo; <em>magnum
 opus</em>,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup>
 a study on the relational pre-conditions of language indebted to, yet
diverging from, Heidegger&rsquo;s investigations of the poetic
<em>logos</em> (Heidegger 1936&ndash;1968 [2000: 59&ndash;64]). As we
have seen, Derrida called <em>Totality and Infinity</em> a
&ldquo;treatise on hospitality&rdquo; (see
&sect;2.4.1, <em>supra</em>) and devoted, in sum, more attention to it
than to <em>Otherwise than Being</em>, although the latter work was in
part a response to Derrida&rsquo;s criticisms in &ldquo;Violence and
Metaphysics&rdquo; (Derrida 1964 [1978]). It remains
that <em>Otherwise than Being</em> reprises elements of Levinas&rsquo;
early research into metaphor as the performative basis of language, as
well as his engagement with Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s cultural
significations, both of which are responsible for a distinct
conception of existence. For Levinas, beneath cultures and
significations, there remains a trace of a non-relative meaning
(<em>sens</em>), which includes &ldquo;the absoluteness of the
presence of the other&rdquo; (Levinas 1964 [1987b: 106]).</p>

<p>
In this regard, the publication of <em>Totality and Infinity</em> was
followed closely by two essays. A talk intitled &ldquo;<em>La
m&eacute;taphore</em>&rdquo; presented at Jean Wahl&rsquo;s
<em>Coll&egrave;ge philosophique</em>, dates from February
 1962.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 The article &ldquo;Meaning and Sense&rdquo; (<em>La signification et
le sens</em>) first appeared in 1964 (Levinas 1964). As much as the
latter article placed Heidegger&rsquo;s fundamental ontology within
historically specific cultures and privileged &ldquo;sense&rdquo; over
being, &ldquo;<em>La m&eacute;taphore</em>&rdquo; returned to a
Maimonidean conception of human language as allegory and expressing
more than the words said therein. Given these preparations, there is
little question that the novelty of <em>Otherwise than Being</em> lies
in its three innovations: (1) the tropes (metaphors) for
transcendence-in-immanence (i.e., recurrence, proximity, obsession,
persecution, and substitution); (2) the deconstruction of language
understood as the site in which existence is stated as an address-,
and (3) Levinas&rsquo; &ldquo;wager&rdquo; of stepping out of
philosophical reasoning to envision a trace encountered in a
performative register that both &ldquo;says&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unsays&rdquo; itself by turns (OBBE 167).</p>

<p>
Despite these innovations, Levinas&rsquo; philosophical project
remains largely constant: <em>to rethink the meaning of existence in
terms of the transcendence of the other and its meaning for
ethics</em>. To that end, he consistently revisited Husserl&rsquo;s
phenomenological method. He reconceived Heidegger&rsquo;s ontological
difference as an irreducible separation between being and the good we
enact. He had extensive, often undeclared recourse to the profound,
anti-totalizing intuitions of religious life, as found in
Rosenzweig&rsquo;s new thinking and indirectly in Maimonides&rsquo;
apophaticism. By reason of his opposition to systems-thought, Levinas
never adhered uncritically to any one philosophy.</p>

<p>
A common thread runs through his philosophy and his Talmudic readings.
Transcendence is one of his words for the spontaneity of
responsibility for another person. Responsibility is experienced in
concrete life and is variously expressed, from words like &ldquo;here
I am&rdquo; to apologies and self-accounting. This is the case,
Levinas argues, even before a <em>de facto</em> command is heard or
reflected upon. This surprising proposition hearkens to the debated
meaning of Jews &ldquo;receiving the Torah before knowing what was
written in it&rdquo; (NTR 42&ndash;43). Levinas names this
responsiveness Platonically, as the &ldquo;Good beyond being&rdquo;.
We <em>perform</em> that good, that trace of the infinite, because
instances of answering to or for another are everyday events, even
though they do not appear typical of self-interested behaviors.</p>

<p>
Above all, we do <em>not choose</em> to be responsible. Responsibility
arises as if elicited, before we begin to think about it, by the
approach of the other person. Because this theme is found in his
philosophy as well as in his interpretations of Talmudic passages,
Levinas&rsquo; thought has, at times, left both Talmud scholars and
philosophers dissatisfied. For some Talmudists, his thought seems
secularly humanistic, with &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; suggesting a
clandestine concept of divinity. No stranger to Mishnah and Gemara
(Talmud), his interpretations are less preoccupied with traditional
inter- and intra-textuality than with the <em>ethical</em> content of
the teachings therein. To philosophers skeptical of him,
Levinas&rsquo; thought reinterprets Heidegger&rsquo;s in-the-world
facticity in a metaphysical vein. Indeed, its anti-foundationalist
approach to responsibility, as the pre-reflective structure of the
embodied, relational &ldquo;self&rdquo; (<em lang="fr">soi</em>),
appears to these critics to move inconsistently between phenomenology
and religious thought, despite its lack of dogmatic commitments. As we
have seen, in his later philosophy, the seemingly metaphysical concept
of illeity expresses my emotive experience of an affective excess
greater than that which I can contain. In this way, it also resembles
Descartes&rsquo; &ldquo;light so resplendent&rdquo;
(Med. III [1911: 171]). But it is precisely in these
tensions, between the Jewish religious and philosophical traditions,
on the one hand, <em>and</em> his phenomenological-existential
thinking-of-the-other, on the other hand, that Levinas&rsquo;
originality lies.</p>
