<h1>Compositionality</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Apr 8, 2004; substantive revision Mon Nov 3, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Languages contain meaningful expressions built from other meaningful
expressions. On the traditional view, the meaning of a complex
expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its
constituents. Once the meanings of the constituents and their mode of
combination are fixed, the meaning of the whole is fixed. This is the
principle of <em>compositionality</em>, a fundamental presupposition
of most contemporary work in semantics.</p>

<p>
Proponents of compositionality emphasize the productivity and
systematicity of the linguistic competence of human beings. Humans can
understand a large&mdash;perhaps infinitely large&mdash;collection of
complex expressions even when first encountered. Humans who understand
some complex expressions can usually also understand other expressions
that result from recombining their constituents. Compositionality is
supposed to feature in the best explanation of these phenomena.
Opponents of compositionality point to cases when meanings of larger
expressions seem to depend on the intentions of the speaker, on the
linguistic environment, or on the setting in which the utterance takes
place without their parts displaying a similar dependence. They try to
respond to the arguments from productivity and systematicity by
insisting that the phenomena are limited, and by suggesting
alternative explanations.</p>

<h2 id="Cla">1. Clarifications</h2>

<p>
The principle of compositionality concerns complex expressions. These
expressions have a structure and constituents. The principle relates
the meaning of the complex expression to its structure and the
meanings of its constituents. Let&rsquo;s take the following as a
common reference
 point.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="pointC">(C)</dt>
<dd>The meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure
and the meanings of its constituents.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The compositionality principle is normally taken to quantify over all
expressions of some language <em>L</em>.</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(C&prime;)</dt>
<dd>For every complex expression <em>e</em> in <em>L</em>, the meaning
of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> is determined by the structure of
<em>e</em> in <em>L</em> and the meanings of the constituents of
<em>e</em> in <em>L</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The principle can be expanded to apply to all expressions in some
class of languages such as the natural languages for human beings.</p>

<p>
These glosses of the principle of compositionality say that the
<em>meaning</em> of a complex expression is <em>determined</em> by its
<em>structure</em> and the <em>meanings</em> of its
<em>constituents</em>. There are different interpretations of the
principle that depend on different interpretations of the notions of
(i) &ldquo;structure&rdquo; and &ldquo;constituency&rdquo;, (ii)
&ldquo;meaning&rdquo;, and (iii) &ldquo;determination&rdquo;. This
section examines how the interpretation of the principle of
compositionality depends on clarifications of these notions.</p>

<h3 id="Syn">1.1 Syntax</h3>

<p>
This section addresses different interpretations of the principle of
compositionality arising from syntax.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 Local and Global Compositionality</h4>

<p>
A syntax for a language specifies a set of expressions and rules for
deriving complex expressions from simpler expressions. These
expressions are the immediate constituents of the complex expression.
Here is a toy example. Suppose English contains expressions of the
category noun such as &lsquo;book&rsquo; and &lsquo;thieves&rsquo;,
and expressions of the category (intransitive) verb such as
&lsquo;steal&rsquo;. One syntactic rule might specify that
concatenating two nouns such as &lsquo;book&rsquo; and
&lsquo;thieves&rsquo; produces a noun phrase &lsquo;book
thieves&rsquo;. Another syntactic rule might specify that
concatenating a noun or noun phrase &lsquo;book thieves&rsquo; and a
verb &lsquo;steal&rsquo; produces a sentence such as (1).</p>

<p>
(1) Book thieves steal.</p>

<p>
The expressions &lsquo;book thieves&rsquo; and &lsquo;steal&rsquo; are
<em>immediate constituent</em>s of (1) because there is a rule that
applies to these expressions to derive (1). The immediate constituents
of any proper constituent of an expression are non-immediate
constituents. Thus, the expressions &lsquo;book&rsquo; and
&lsquo;thieves&rsquo; are non-immediate constituents of (1) in virtue
of being immediate constituents of one of its constituents.</p>

<p>
Each complex expression is generated by some syntactic rule. How does
one identify the syntactic rule that generates the expression? The
evidence for a syntactic theory depends on whether the language is
natural or artificial.</p>

<p>
The syntax of an <em>artificial</em> language (such as the languages
of propositional and first-order logic or computer programming
languages) can be settled by checking the appropriate stipulations.
Often, the syntax is designed to compositionally align with the
semantics.</p>

<p>
The syntax of a <em>natural</em> language requires empirical
investigation. Constituency tests are one source of evidence. These
tests purport to identify the constituents of a sentence in terms of a
range of related grammatical sentences. One constituency test is
topicalization. Syntactic constituents of the right sort can normally
be made the topic of the sentence by preposing them. For example, in
&lsquo;the boy believed the book fell&rsquo;, the string &lsquo;the
book fell&rsquo; can be made the topic. This is clear from the fact
that &lsquo;the book fell, the boy believed&rsquo; is an acceptable
string of English. However, non-constituents can usually not be made
the topic. For example, the string &lsquo;the book fell&rsquo; occurs
in the longer string &lsquo;the boy who put the note in the book
fell&rsquo;. However, the string &lsquo;the book fell, the boy who put
the note in&rsquo; is not an acceptable string of English. This
provides some evidence that &lsquo;the book fell&rsquo; is not a
constituent of the latter string. Other coordination tests investigate
whether a putative constituent can be coordinated with another string
using &lsquo;and&rsquo; or &lsquo;or&rsquo; or can be replaced by a
proform. Again, passing a constituency test is <em>prima facie
evidence</em> that the string is a constituent of the larger sentence.
Failing a constituency test in the right circumstances can be
<em>prima facie evidence</em> that a string is not a constituent of
the larger sentence. The range and significance of constituency tests
will depend on one&rsquo;s background syntactic
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The constituents and structure of an expression follow from its
syntactic derivation. Different versions of the principle of
compositionality appeal to different features of these derivations.
<em>Local compositionality</em> appeals to the fact that an expression
is the <em>immediate</em> output of some syntactic rule to its
immediate constituents. The sentence &lsquo;book thieves steal&rsquo;
is the immediate output of a rule combining &lsquo;book thieves&rsquo;
with &lsquo;steal&rsquo;. Local compositionality says that the meaning
of an expression is determined by the local rule that generates it and
the meanings of its immediate constituents.</p>

<p>
(C\(_{\textit{local}}\)) For every complex expression <em>e</em> in
<em>L</em>, the meaning of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> is determined by
the immediate structure of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> and the meanings
of the immediate constituents of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em>.</p>

<p>
According to (C\(_{\textit{local}}\)), two expressions of a language
that have different meanings must either derive from applying
different local syntactic rules or must have corresponding immediate
constituents with different meanings.</p>

<p>
A weaker principle, <em>global compositionality</em>, appeals to the
fact that the constituents of an expression may themselves be complex.
In the example, &lsquo;book thieves&rsquo; is a complex constituent of
(1). Global compositionality says the meaning of an expression depends
not only on the <em>immediate</em> syntactic rule that generates it
and on the meanings of its <em>immediate</em> constituents, but also
on the syntactic rules that generate its constituents and on the
meanings of the constituents of its constituents, etc. So, the meaning
of (1) will depend not merely on the rule that combines a noun phrase
and verb phrase and on the meanings of &lsquo;book thieves&rsquo; and
&lsquo;steal&rsquo;, but also on the rule that generates &lsquo;book
thieves&rsquo; and on the meanings of &lsquo;book&rsquo; and
&lsquo;thieves&rsquo;. Unlike (C\(_{\textit{local}}\)), global
compositionality allows two expressions to have different meanings
even though they are generated by applying the same rule to immediate
constituent with the same meanings. Unlike local compositionality,
global compositionality is compatible with the sentences (1) and
&lsquo;biblioklepts steal&rsquo; having different meanings even if
&lsquo;book thieves&rsquo; and &lsquo;biblioklepts&rsquo; have the
same meaning.</p>

<h4>1.1.2 Ambiguity, Hidden Structure, and Direct Compositionality </h4>

<p>
The statement (C) presupposes that the ordinary expression, the
surface form, is the product of the syntactic derivation and is the
bearer of meaning. The surface form is construed as a string of words.
Thus, the surface form of (1) is the string &lsquo;book thieves
steal&rsquo;. This assumption accords with an approach to semantics
known as <em>direct compositionality</em>. Direct compositionality
says that the surface form is the bearer of meaning. Advocates of
direct compositionality usually deny that an expression can have empty
or invisible constituents; cf. Jacobson 2002, 2012 and Kracht
2007.</p>

<p>
Many approaches to semantics reject direct compositionality. On these
views, the principle of compositionality applies to the derivation or
some underlying &ldquo;logical&rdquo; form (or LF) rather than the
surface forms. One reason these approaches depart from direct
compositionality arises from ambiguity. As it is glossed in (C),
compositionality is a thesis about &ldquo;the&rdquo; meaning of an
expression. This assumes that each expression has exactly one meaning.
In cases of ambiguity, some surface expression is associated with two
meanings. The ambiguity might be lexical, arising from a single basic
constituent having two meaning (i.e. &lsquo;bank&rsquo; can mean a
financial institution or the lining of a river). There are also
structural ambiguities, arising from one complex expression having
multiple derivations (i.e. &lsquo;big dogs and cats&rsquo; can be
derived by combining the adjective &lsquo;big&rsquo; with the
conjoined noun phrase &lsquo;dogs and cats&rsquo; or from conjoining
the noun phrases &lsquo;big dogs&rsquo; and &lsquo;cats&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
Some conclude that the surface forms are not the bearers of meaning.
The bearers of meaning are the syntactic derivations themselves or
some disambiguated underlying LFs; cf. Pagin and Westerst&aring;hl
2010a (252). Advocates of direct compositionality respond by framing
their semantics in ways that allow for one surface expression to have
multiple meanings; cf. Kracht 2003 (&sect;3.1); 2007; Jacobson 2014;
and Pagin and Westerst&aring;hl 2010a (footnote 27).</p>

<p>
Other departures from direct compositionality posit syntactic
constituents that do not appear in the surface form. Quantifier scope
ambiguity is one prominent example. A sentence such as &lsquo;somebody
loves everybody&rsquo; is ambiguous between saying that someone is a
universal lover and saying that everyone is loved. One explanation of
this ambiguity says that the surface sentence corresponds to two
underlying LFs in which the quantifiers &lsquo;somebody&rsquo; and
&lsquo;everybody&rsquo; enter the derivation at different points. The
quantifiers bind &ldquo;traces&rdquo; that serve as the subject and
direct object of &lsquo;love&rsquo;. The two readings might be
represented respectively as &lsquo;[Somebody 1][[Everybody 2][1 loves
2]]&rsquo; and &lsquo;[Everybody 2][[Somebody 1][1 loves 2]]&rsquo;.
May (1977, 1985) offered the classic syntactic arguments in favor of
this type of approach, with some arguments figuring in earlier sources
including Lackoff 1970; cf. Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 1990 (Ch.
3); Larson and Segal, 1995 (Ch. 7); Heim and Kratzer 1998 (Ch. 5).</p>

<p>
Advocates of direct compositionality argue that quantifier scope
ambiguities can be handled at the surface level, without appealing to
hidden constituents. Instead, they appeal to complexity in the
syntactic categories and semantic types. Using this additional
complexity, direct compositionality can avoid the complexity involved
in positing unvoiced constituents or in making use of more complicated
syntactic derivation rules (Jacobson 2014; Heim and Kratzer 1998, Ch.
7). It is unlikely that any one data point will decide between the two
approaches, and the choice will have to be made by high-level
theoretical considerations once the theories are fully developed.</p>

<h4>1.1.3 Syntax and Non-Linguistic Representations</h4>

<p>
Compositionality primarily concerns language. However, it may be
extended to other kinds of representation provided that the syntactic
notions of constituency and structure can be extended to these
representations. What would such an extended sense be? Consider road
signs such as the No-Left-Turn sign:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="noleftturn.jpg" alt="[road sign: a red circle with an upper left to lower right diagonal over a black arrow that goes up and then to the left; background is a white square]" class="nocaption" />
</div>

<p>
This could be viewed as a complex sign decomposable into meaningful
features&mdash;the shape, the color pattern, the arrow, etc. These
features are the analogues of simple expressions: they appear in many
other complex signs, and they appear to contribute more or less
uniformly to their meanings.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="nouturn.jpg" alt="[road sign: a red circle with an upper left to lower right diagonal over a black arrow that goes up, to the left and then down; background is a white square]" />
<img src="bearleftonly.jpg" alt="[road sign: a black arrow going up and bending to the left; the word 'ONLY' is below it; background is a white square]" />
<img src="notrucks.jpg" alt="[road sign: a red circle with an upper left to lower right diagonal over a black iconic truck; background is a white square]" />
<img src="interstates.jpg" alt="[road sign: green square with a white arrow that goes up then splits with one arrow bending left and one bending right; below the arrow are the words '1 MILE'; above the left is an interstate logo with the number '10'; above the right is an interstate logo with the number '17']" />
<img src="donotenter.jpg" alt="[road sign: a solid red circle with a white horizontal bar in the middle; above the bar are the words 'DO NO' and below the word 'ENTER'; background is a white square]" />
</div>

<p>
Once the relevant notion of constituency has been fixed, it is
possible to ask the question of whether this system of representations
is
 compositional.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 </div>

<p>
There have been many attempts to extend formal semantics to other
sorts of representation, including maps (Casati and Varzi 1999, Camp
2007, Rescola 2009, Blumson 2012), images (Kulvicki, 2006, Greenberg
2021), and Venn and Euler diagrams (Shin 1994, Greenberg 2024). In
each case, the issue of compositionality can be raised.</p>

<p>
A related issue is whether thought is compositional. If thought is a
kind of language, it is intelligible to ask whether it is
compositional. Thought would not have to be <em>much</em> like
English, Korean, or Swahili for the question of compositionality to
make sense, but thoughts must have meanings and have meaningful
constituents. These assumptions follow from
 <a href="../language-thought/">the language of thought hypothesis</a>
 (see entry).</p>

<p>
Even if thought is not a language, it might be compositional in an
extended sense. Compositionality demands that some complex
representations be derivable from other representations. However, this
derivability does not immediately entail that thought is
language-like; cf. van Gelder 1990. If the representational properties
(or meaning) of the complex representation are determined by the
representational properties of the simpler representations and their
structures, then the complex representation is compositional in the
extended sense.</p>

<p>
These issues arise in the major debate within the philosophy of mind
between proponents of classical cognitive architecture and proponents
of
 <a href="../connectionism/">connectionism</a>
 (see entry). The debate is sometimes presented as a debate about
compositionality. However, the issue tends to be whether there are
such things as meaningful constituents of thought, and if there are,
whether these contribute the same thing to all thoughts in which they
occur. If the answer to the first question is negative, the question
of compositionality does not arise. If the answer to the first
question is positive, the second is independent of compositionality.
The debate about connectionism also raises the question about whether
semantic composition is reversible. This notion of <em>reverse
compositionality</em> is discussed below in section 1.4.2.</p>

<h3 id="Mea">1.2 Meaning</h3>

<p>
Compositionality says that the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of an expression
is determined by the &ldquo;meanings&rdquo; of its constituents and by
their arrangement in the sentence. What notion of meaning is governed
by the principle? Certainly, some notions of meaning such as
conversational implicatures are not determined compositionally.
However, logicians, philosophers, and linguists have proposed that
various notions of meaning can be compositionally determined in a
natural or artificial language. This section will briefly review some
of these notions. In each case, there have been challenges to their
claims of compositionality.</p>

<h4>1.2.1 The Compositionality of Reference</h4>

<p>
Frege constructed an artificial language, the
<em>Begriffsschrift</em>, to model reasoning in logic and arithmetic.
Frege&rsquo;s explanation of the <em>Begriffsschrift</em> is a
milestone of compositional semantics. In <em>The Basic Laws of
Arithmetic</em>, Frege most clearly laid out his syntax and semantics.
Frege enumerated basic expressions of <em>Begriffsschrift</em>. The
language includes proper names such as &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Gaul&rsquo;. There are also
<em>n</em>-ary predicates such as the binary predicate
&lsquo;conquered&rsquo;. Finally, Frege specified rules for deriving
complex expressions out of simpler expressions. A sentence is formed
by combining an <em>n</em>-ary predicate and <em>n</em> names. So,
sentence (2) can be formed by combining the binary predicate
&lsquo;conquered&rsquo; with two names &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Gaul&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
(2) Caesar conquered Gaul.</p>

<p>
Frege also proposed meanings for the basic expressions and rules
specifying the meaning of a complex expressions in terms of its
structure and the meanings of their constituents. The relevant notion
of meaning is determined by what is important for logic. Frege calls
this notion of meaning <em>Bedeutung</em>, or <em>reference</em>.</p>

<p>
For Frege, a proper name refers to an object: &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;
refers to Caesar; &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;, to Cicero; and
&lsquo;Gaul&rsquo;, to Gaul. An <em>n</em>-ary predicate refers to a
function from <em>n</em> objects to truth-values. Since
&lsquo;conquered&rsquo; is a binary predicate, it refers to a function
from two objects into truth-values.</p>

<p>
The sentence that results from combining an <em>n</em>-ary predicate
with <em>n</em> proper names refers to the value of the function
referred to by the predicate for the arguments referred to by the
names. For example, (2) refers to the value of the function referred
to by &lsquo;conquered&rsquo; for the arguments referred to by
&lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gaul&rsquo;. So, a sentence such as
(2) refers to its truth-value, the true, and a sentence such as (3)
refers to its truth-value, the false.</p>

<p>
(3) Cicero conquered Gaul.</p>

<p>
For Frege, the truth-value is the referent of a sentence because it is
sentence&rsquo;s preeminent logical property.</p>

<p>
This fragment of <em>Begriffsschrift</em> is compositional. Indeed, it
is widely held that Frege wanted reference to be compositional for the
whole language of <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (including logical
connectives and the quantifiers). The evidence for this is that Frege
clearly holds that substituting expressions with the same reference
preserves reference; cf. (Pelletier 2001, 101-2). However, even if
Frege aimed for a compositional theory of reference, there is debate
about whether he achieved it, for reasons having to do with
 quantification.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4>1.2.2 The Compositionality of Propositional Content</h4>

<p>
Frege observes that two sentences with the same truth-value can have
different <em>cognitive values.</em> For example, the sentences (2)
and (4) are both true.</p>

<p>
(4) Cicero is identical to Cicero.</p>

<p>
However, (2) is significant while (4) is trivial. Frege posits an
additional level of meaning, sense, to explain this difference. The
sense of a sentence is the <em>thought</em> that the sentence
expresses. So, (2) has as its sense the thought that Caesar conquered
Gaul, and (4) has as its sense the thought that Cicero is identical to
Cicero. A Fregean thought is the object of thinking, belief, and other
attitudes. Today, Fregean thoughts are commonly known as
 <a href="../propositions/">propositions</a>
 (see entry).</p>

<p>
Frege also posits senses for subsentential expressions such as names
and predicates. One reason is that substituting co-referential names
in a sentence does not always preserve its sense. The names
&lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tully&rsquo; both refer to the Roman
orator Cicero, but sentences (4) and (5) differ in cognitive
significance.</p>

<p>
(5) Cicero is identical to Tully.</p>

<p>
Frege concludes that names like &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Tully&rsquo; have distinct senses even though they share a
referent.</p>

<p>
Frege seems to be arguing that because (4) and (5) express distinct
thoughts but differ only in the substitution of &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;
for &lsquo;Tully&rsquo;, these subsentential expressions must have
different cognitive values. Although there are disagreements on this
point, arguments of this sort suggest that Frege holds that the sense
of a complex expression is determined by the senses of its
constituents; cf. Dummett 1973, Heck and May 2011, and Pickel 2021.
For dissent, see Janssen 1997 and Pelletier 2001.</p>

<h4>1.2.3 The Compositionality of Intension</h4>

<p>
Another milestone in the discussion of compositionality is
Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Meaning and Necessity</em>. Carnap develops an
artificial language to model reasoning about possibility and
necessity. In this language, substituting one sentence of another with
the same truth-value does not always preserve truth-value. The
sentences (2) and (4) have the same truth-value, but the sentences
&lsquo;Necessarily: Caesar conquered Gaul&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Necessarily: Cicero is identical to Cicero&rsquo; have
different truth-values. In Carnap&rsquo;s language, if a constituent
in a complex expression is substituted for another constituent with
the same intension, then the new complex expression will have the same
intension as the original. Thus, there is a clear sense in which the
intension of a expression is determined by its structure and by the
intensions of the expression&rsquo;s constituents. (See Carnap 1947,
&sect;&sect;11-12.)</p>

<p>
But what are intensions? The intension of an expression determines
what Carnap calls an <em>extension</em> for each possibility. An
extension is very close to what Frege takes to be the referent of an
expression. The extension of a sentence is a truth-value; the
extension of a name is its referent; and the extension of a predicate
is a set of individuals (or its characteristic function, as in Fregean
reference). So, the intension of an expression can be modeled as a
function that takes a possibility as argument and returns its
extension (or Fregean referent) as value. In Carnap&rsquo;s own work,
possibilities are given by state descriptions, which are sets of
sentences defining a possible situation. Today, these possibilities
are taken as possible worlds.</p>

<p>
The appeal of intensional semantics is not limited to artificial
languages like Carnap&rsquo;s. Compositional intensional semantics has
become a dominant approach in contemporary formal semantics for
<em>natural</em> language. See Montague 1970; Lewis 1970; Stanley
2009.</p>

<h4>1.2.4 Meaning and Context</h4>

<p>
In contrast to artificial languages, natural languages contain
indexicals, which require the distinction between two notions of
meaning. On the one hand, expressions have a <em>standing meaning</em>
fixed by convention and known to those who are linguistically
competent. A sentence such as &lsquo;I conquered Gaul&rsquo; is an
unambiguous sentence of English. On the other hand, expressions in use
are associated with <em>occasion meanings</em> which is discerned by
interpreters in part on the basis of contextual information. The
utterances of &lsquo;I conquered Gaul&rsquo; by Caesar and by Cicero
differ in all of the respects covered thus far: truth-value,
propositional content, and intension. The terminology of <em>standing
meaning</em> and <em>occasion meaning</em> comes from Quine (1960).
Kaplan (1977) uses the terms <em>character</em> and
<em>content.</em></p>

<p>
Corresponding to these two notions of meaning, there are two versions
of the principle of compositionality. Since occasion-meaning is
determined, in part, by context (C\(_{\textit{occ}}\)) must be
relativized to
 context:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag35em">
<dt>(C\(_{\textit{stand}}\))</dt>
<dd>For every complex expression <em>e</em> in <em>L</em>, the
standing meaning of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> is determined by the
structure of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> and the standing meanings of the
constituents of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em>.</dd>
<dt id="pointCocc">(C\(_{\textit{occ}}\))</dt>
<dd>For every complex expression <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> and every
context <em>c</em>, the occasion meaning of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em>
at <em>c</em> is determined by the structure of <em>e</em> in
<em>L</em> and the occasion meanings of the constituents of <em>e</em>
in <em>L</em> at <em>c</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Recently, a number of arguments have purported to show that (C) is
false. These arguments pertain to the features that are often modeled
as variables: bound pronouns, tenses, and modalities. Schlenker (2002,
64) offers a natural language example. A sentence such as (6) has as
its occasion meaning that the referent of &lsquo;he&rsquo; in context
left two days prior to the context of utterance. So, an utterance of
(6) on 4 January 2000 demonstrating John has the same occasion meaning
as (7).</p>

<p>
(6) He left two days ago.</p>

<p>
(7) He left on 2 January 2000.</p>

<p>
However, (6) and (7) seem to have different occasion meanings when
embedded (even when they are both uttered on 4 January 2000). Contrast
the following: &lsquo;Over the years, John told me that he left two
days ago&rsquo; and &lsquo;Over the years, John told me that he left
on 2 January 2000&rsquo;. Schlenker judges that these two sentences
have different occasion meanings. The former sentence says that John
repeatedly told the speaker that John left two days before
John&rsquo;s speaking. This suggests that the expression &lsquo;two
days ago&rsquo; contributes something other than its occasion
meaning<em>.</em> One standard response is that an expression such as
&lsquo;two days ago&rsquo; does not contribute its occasion meaning,
but only its standing meaning to determining the occasion meaning of
the longer sentence. A rival response appeals to internal dynamics in
a sentence to find an appropriate occasion meaning. On these views,
the context relevant to determining the occasion meaning of &lsquo;two
days ago&rsquo; depends on its position in the sentence. For
discussion of related cases, see: Rabern 2012, Yli-Vakkuri 2013, King
and Glanzberg 2020, and Stonji&#263;
 2021.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4>1.3 Determination</h4>

<p>
This section will discuss interpretations of compositionality that
differ in their understanding of <em>determination</em>. In what sense
is the meaning of a complex expression determined by its structure and
the meanings of its parts?</p>

<h4>1.3.1 Substitutional Compositionality</h4>

<p>
If the meaning of a complex expression is <em>determined</em> by its
structure and the meanings of its constituents, then any expression
with the same structure and the same meanings assigned to its
corresponding constituents must have the same meaning. One way of
implementing this idea is to hold that if two complex expressions
differ only by the substitution of synonyms, then they are synonymous.
The antecedent of this principle is meant to hold fixed the structure
of the complex expression and the meanings of its pairwise
constituents. The only thing that differs between the complex
expressions are the words used, not their meanings. Thus, the complex
expressions must have the same meaning.</p>

<p>
This interpretation assumes that compositionality is <em>local</em>.
If the expressions &lsquo;book thieves&rsquo; and
&lsquo;biblioklepts&rsquo; are synonyms, then local compositionality
demands that expressions that differ by substituting &lsquo;book
thieves&rsquo; for &lsquo;biblioklepts&rsquo; have the same meaning.
Global compositionality says that the meaning of a complex expression
is determined not merely by its immediate structure and the meanings
of its immediate constituents, but by its total structure and the
meanings of all of its constituents (including both immediate and
non-immediate constituents). If global compositionality holds, then
substituting basic constituents with the same meaning will always
preserve meaning. Substituting non-basic constituents can change
meaning. Because local compositionality is more relevant for
linguistics, the following discussion will be centered around this
principle.</p>

<p>
The interpretation also assumes that constituents (rather than mere
sub-strings) are substituted. Otherwise, as Geach pointed out, the
synonymy of &lsquo;Plato was bald&rsquo; with &lsquo;Baldness was an
attribute of Plato&rsquo; would guarantee the synonymy of &lsquo;The
philosopher whose most eminent pupil was Plato was bald&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The philosopher whose most eminent pupil was baldness was an
attribute of Plato&rsquo; (Geach 1965, 110).</p>

<p>
The principle that synonyms are substitutable comes in two
versions:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt id="pointSsingular">(S\(_{\textit{singular}}\))</dt>
<dd>If two meaningful expressions differ only in that one is the
result of substituting a synonym for a constituent within the other,
then the two expressions are synonyms.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt id="pointSplural">(S\(_{\textit{plural}}\))</dt>
<dd>If two meaningful expressions differ only in that one is the
result of substituting some synonyms for some constituents within the
other, then the two expressions are synonyms.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The principle (S\(_{\textit{singular}}\)) says that substituting one
synonym at a time preserves meaning. The principle
(S\(_{\textit{plural}}\)) says that substituting several synonyms at a
time preserves meaning. The two principles are equivalent given a
background assumptions about substitution.</p>

<p>
The background assumption concerns whether substitution of synonyms
can turn a meaningful expression into a meaningless one, and whether
it can turn a meaningful expression into an expression with a
different meaning. The principle that rules out the former possibility
was first proposed by Husserl (1913, 318), and it is usually stated in
terms of the notion of a <em>semantic category</em>. Two expressions
belong to the same semantic category just in case they are
intersubstitutable within any meaningful expression <em>salva
significatione</em> (without loss of meaningfulness). According to
Husserl&rsquo;s principle:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="pointH">(H)</dt>
<dd>Synonyms belong in the same semantic category.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Assuming in addition that the language satisfies
 <a href="#pointH">(H)</a>,
 (S\(_{\textit{singular}}\)) is equivalent to
(S\(_{\textit{plural}}\)); cf. Hodges (2001: Theorem 4). The reason
that the two principles are not equivalent without (H) is that it is
possible that a double substitution of expressions yields a meaningful
expression while individual substitutions do not. Hodges (2001, 13)
offers the example that starting with &lsquo;fast asleep&rsquo; and
jointly substituting &lsquo;fast&rsquo; for &lsquo;deeply&rsquo; and
&lsquo;sleeping&rsquo; for &lsquo;asleep&rsquo; yields a meaningful
expression &lsquo;fast asleep&rsquo;. On the other hand, the
individual substitutions yields expressions that may not be
meaningful: &lsquo;fast sleeping&rsquo; and &lsquo;deeply
asleep&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
(H) is a controversial for natural language&mdash;intuitively, there
are many synonyms that are not everywhere intersubstitutable. For
example, &lsquo;likely&rsquo; and &lsquo;probable&rsquo; mean pretty
much the same even though &lsquo;Jacques is likely to leave&rsquo; is
meaningful while &lsquo;Jacques is probable to leave&rsquo; is
arguably not; cf. Gazdar (1985,
 32).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 And&mdash;more controversially&mdash;there might be synonyms that are
almost nowhere intersubstitutable: &lsquo;quick&rsquo; and
&lsquo;quickly&rsquo; are good candidates.</p>

<h4>1.3.2 Rule-to-Rule Compositionality</h4>

<p>
Sometimes the claim that <em>L</em> is compositional is presented
directly as a claim about the relationship between its syntax and
semantics. The following thesis is often called <em>rule-to-rule
compositionality</em>:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag35em">
<dt id="pointRR">(RR)</dt>
<dd>To every syntactic rule corresponds a semantic rule that assigns
meanings to the output of the syntactic rule on the basis of the
meanings of its inputs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Consider a rule of a toy syntax that allows one to combine a noun
phrase (such as &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Tully&rsquo;) with a verb phrase (&lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;)
to form sentences (&lsquo;Caesar conquered Gaul&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cicero
conquered Gaul&rsquo;, &lsquo;Tully conquered Gaul&rsquo;, and so on).
Rule-to-rule compositionality says that there is a corresponding rule
<em>G</em> that specifies the meanings of the sentence in terms of the
meanings of its constituents. The meaning of &lsquo;Caesar conquered
Gaul&rsquo; would be the result of applying the operation G to the
meanings of &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and &lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;. The
meaning of &lsquo;Cicero conquered Gaul&rsquo; would similarly be the
result of applying G to the meanings of &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; and
&lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Montague (1970) suggested a perspicuous way to formally capture
rule-to-rule compositionality: compositionality requires the existence
of a <em>homomorphism</em> between the expressions of a language and
the meanings of those expressions. Consider the expressions of a
language (including both simple and complex expressions) as a set
<em>E</em> upon which a number of operations (syntactic rules) are
defined. There is a set \(\Gamma \) of syntactic rules for the
language. Each of the rules \(F_{\gamma}\) is characterized by a
(partial) function that takes a fixed number of expressions from
<em>E</em> and returns another expression of <em>E</em>. For example,
one rule might combine a noun phrase (&lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;) and a verb
phrase (&lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;) to form a sentence
(&lsquo;Caesar conquered Gaul&rsquo;). The expressions <em>E</em> and
rules in \(\Gamma \) define a partial algebra \(\mathbf{E} = \langle
E, (F_{\gamma})_{\gamma \in \Gamma}\rangle\). Call this the
<em>syntactic algebra</em>. This is just the set of expressions in the
language and the set of formation rules relating them.</p>

<p>
Compositionality concerns the relationship between the language (the
syntactic algebra) and the set of meanings. A meaning-assignment
<em>m</em> is a function that maps expressions in <em>E</em> to
<em>M</em>, the set of available meanings for the expressions of
<em>E</em>. On Montague&rsquo;s implementation, compositionality
demands that the meaning assignment <em>m</em> is a homomorphism.</p>

<p>
Consider a specific syntactic operation <em>F</em> which takes <em>k
</em>expressions, \(e_1 ,\ldots ,e_k\), as input and specifies a
complex expression, \(F(e_1 ,\ldots ,e_k)\). <em>m</em> is <em>a
homomorphism</em> for operation F if and only if there is a
<em>k</em>-ary partial function <em>G</em> on <em>M</em> such that
whenever \(F(e_1 ,\ldots ,e_k)\) is defined,</p>

<p>

\[m(F(e_1 ,\ldots ,e_k)) = G(m(e_1),\ldots ,m(e_k)).\]
</p>

<p>
In English: this means that there is a partial function <em>G</em>
from the meanings of \(e_1 ,\ldots ,e_k\) to the meaning of the
expression built from \(e_1 ,\ldots ,e_k\) through an application of
the syntactic rule <em>F</em>. To return to the example, for the
syntactic rule that forms a sentence by concatenating a noun phrase
(&lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;) with a verb phrase (&lsquo;conquered
Gaul&rsquo;), there is a semantic rule <em>G</em> such that the
meaning of the sentence (such as its truth-value or intension) is
determined by applying <em>G</em> to the meaning of the noun phrase
(say, Caesar) and the meaning of the verb phrase (such as the set of
people who conquered Gaul).</p>

<p>
Finally, the meaning assignment <em>m</em> is compositional
<em>simpliciter</em> just in case <em>m</em> is a homomorphism for
each syntactic operation in <strong>E</strong>. Whenever <em>m</em> is
compositional, it induces the semantic algebra \(\mathbf{M} = \langle
M, (G_{\gamma})_{\gamma \in \Gamma}\rangle\) on <em>M</em>, and it is
a homomorphism between <strong>E</strong> and <strong>M</strong>; cf.
Westerst&aring;hl (1998). (For details, variants, and formal results,
see Janssen 1983, 1997, Hodges 2001, and Pagin &amp; Westerst&aring;hl
2010a. For generalizations that cover languages with various sorts of
context-dependence, see Pagin 2005, Pagin &amp; Pelletier 2007, and
Westerst&aring;hl
 2012.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4>1.3.3 Compositionality Across Languages</h4>

<p>
The substitutivity of synonyms and rule-to-rule compositionality each
seem to be entailments of the principle of compositionality. However,
they are both language-bound in ways that the compositionality
principle itself is not. Each principle rules out the existence of a
pair of non-synonymous complex expressions with identical structure
and pairwise synonymous constituents within a <em>single</em>
language. However, the principles say nothing about how to compare
meanings across languages. There are two issues with this.</p>

<p>
One issue is that both implementations are compatible with the
existence of non-synonymous complex expressions in different languages
with the same structure and whose constituents have the same meaning.
This is a violation of the idea that the meaning of a complex
expression is determined by its structure and by the meanings of its
constituents. Here is an illustration from Szab&oacute; (2000b).
Suppose English is compositional. We define a new language
Crypto-English that is just like English one small difference. So,
Crypto-English has the same expressions and the same syntax as
English. Semantically, all expressions of Crypto-English have the same
meanings with one important exception. Take two of its non-synonymous
sentences, say, &lsquo;Elephants are grey&rsquo; and &lsquo;Julius
Caesar conquered Gaul&rsquo;. The <em>only</em> difference between the
two languages is that if a sentence is synonymous in English with one
of the two designated sentences, then it is synonymous with the other
in Crypto-English. Given the assumption that English is compositional,
there is no pair of non-synonymous complex expressions in English with
identical structure and pairwise synonymous constituents. Trivially,
the same must hold for Crypto-English as well. But intuitively,
Crypto-English is <em>not</em> compositional. The structure and the
meanings of constituents of the Crypto-English sentence
&lsquo;Elephants are grey&rsquo; cannot determine what this sentence
means in Crypto-English&mdash;if they did then the structure and the
meanings of constituents of the English sentence &lsquo;Elephants are
grey&rsquo; would have to determine what &lsquo;Julius Caesar
conquered Gaul&rsquo; means in English. If there is a language such as
Crypto-English in addition to English, it would follow that the
meaning of a complex expression is not determined only by its
structure and by the meanings of its constituents, but also by the
language in which it occurs.</p>

<p>
We have understood compositionality as saying that the meaning of a
complex expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of
its constituents. The problem is that this formulation is compatible
with different languages having different functions from structures
and the meanings of the parts to the meaning of the whole. This can be
avoided by requiring that in every possible natural human language,
the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the same function
from structures and the meanings of the constituents.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag35em">
<dt id="pointCcross">(C\(_{\textit{cross}}\))</dt>
<dd>For every complex expression <em>e</em> in <em>L</em>, the meaning
of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> is functionally determined through a
single function for all possible human languages by the structure of
<em>e</em> in <em>L</em> and the meanings of the constituents of
<em>e</em> in <em>L</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It was assumed that English and Crypto-English have the same syntactic
rules (and thus the same structures) and that the meanings of the
basic expressions are the same. If the function that determines the
meanings of the complex expressions must be the same in all languages,
then the possibility of a language such as Crypto-English, which
differs from English only by switching the denotations of certain
complex expressions, is ruled out.</p>

<p>
The other issue arises from the fact that the principle of
compositionality is meant to abstract away from the particular
features of the words (e.g. spelling, pronunciation) in determining
the meanings of complex expressions. For example, if
&lsquo;biblioklept&rsquo; and &lsquo;book thief&rsquo; have the same
meaning, then complex expressions that differ only by the choice of
one expression for the other have the same meaning. The identities of
the words don&rsquo;t matter to determining the meaning of the complex
expression. Suppose that there is a natural language that contains a
word meaning the same as &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and a phrase meaning the
same as &lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;. Suppose that there is a
syntactic rule that combines these expressions into a sentence. Does
the principle of compositionality (understood as either the
substitutivity of synonyms or as rule-to-rule compositionality) entail
that this sentence has the same meaning as the English sentence (2)
&lsquo;Caesar conquered Gaul&rsquo;? It does not. The principle of
compositionality says that if two sentences have <em>the same
structure</em> and their corresponding constituents have the same
meanings, then the two sentences have the same meaning. In order to
infer that the meaning of the sentence of the new language is the same
as the meaning of (2), one needs the additional premise that the two
sentences have the same structure. In the context assumed so far, this
would mean that the syntactic rule from which the new sentence is
derived is the same as the syntactic rule from which the English
sentence (2) was derived. This (toy) English rule said that a sentence
can be derived by combining a noun phrase and a verb phrase. However,
the new language might not even have the same syntactic categories as
English.</p>

<p>
One response strengthens rule-to-rule compositionality. Rule-to-rule
compositionality says that for every rule generating a complex
expression out of some constituent expressions, there is a function
from the meanings of the constituent expressions to the meaning of the
whole. In other words, for every syntactic composition rule, there is
a corresponding semantic composition rule. The new response restricts
the range of admissible semantic composition rules. There are only a
few functions from the meanings of the constituents to the meanings of
the complex.</p>

<p>
Some have held that a single semantic evaluation rule specifies the
meaning of a complex in terms of its structure and the meanings of its
constituents and that this rule applies in every natural language.
This type of view might be seen in Lewis&rsquo;s (1970, 29)
description of the appeal of a &ldquo;uniform
function-and-argument&rdquo; rule. On this view, every complex
expression <em>E</em> in any natural language has a constituent whose
meaning is a function <em>f</em>, and the meaning of <em>E</em> is the
value of <em>f</em> when it takes the remaining constituents as
arguments. So, if (2) is composed of &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and
&lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;, then the meaning of &lsquo;conquered
Gaul&rsquo; is a function and the meaning of &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; is
an argument for the function. The meaning of (2) would be the result
of applying this function to the meaning of &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;. In
any language, if there is a sentence with one component meaning the
same as &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo; and the other component meaning
&lsquo;conquered Gaul&rsquo;, the meaning of this sentence will be
determined in exactly the same way. Other approaches agree that there
is a single uniform semantic evaluation rule for all natural languages
but deny that it is functional application. For instance, Pietroski
(2005, 2012, 2018) advocates a relatively uniform rule of conjunction.
The meaning of any complex expression is the result of conjoining the
meanings of its constituents.</p>

<p>
Many standard works opt for a minimum set of rules rather than a
single semantic rule. On these views, it is not the case that every
syntactic formation rule corresponds to the same function in every
natural language. Even within a language, different syntactic
formation rules correspond to different function. However, each new
semantic rule is considered a cost to the theory; cf. Heim and Kratzer
1998 (65-67).</p>

<p>
These approaches can be freed from dependence on features of a
particular language by embracing <em>type-driven
compositionality</em>, which is another strengthening of rule-to-rule
compositionality. Type-driven compositionality assumes that meanings
divide into a variety of semantic types just as expressions divide
into syntactic categories. There are certain admissible rules for
putting meanings of some given types together in order to determine
another meaning. Type-driven compositionality says that the meaning of
a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its immediate
constituents alone. Type-driven compositionality is meant to explain
why speakers do not need to learn the particular identity of the
syntactic rules of a language in order to derive the meaning of a
complex expression from their knowledge of the meaning of its
constituents. Type-driven compositionality is normally combined with
the thesis that syntactic branching is binary so that every complex
expression has exactly two immediate constituents. It would follow
that the meaning of any expression is wholly determined by the
meanings of its two immediate constituents. The original sources of
this idea are Klein and Sag 1982 and Jacobson 1982. Some modern
discussion includes (Heim and Kratzer 1998, &sect;3.1) and (Jacobson
2014, chapter 6).</p>

<h2 id="RelPri">2 Related Principles</h2>

<p>
This section compares
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>
 to some principles often discussed alongside compositionality.</p>

<h3 id="ColCom">2.1 Collective Compositionality</h3>

<p>
Compositionality says that the meaning of a complex expression is
determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents. One
plausible consequence was the substitutivity of synonyms: that if two
complex expressions differ by the substitution of one term for a
synonym, then the complex expressions have the same meaning sentence.
However, to derive this consequence, compositionality must be
construed as <em>distributive</em>. Each occurrence of an expression
contributes its meaning individually to expressions that contain
it.</p>

<p>
Distributive compositionality has been challenged, however. Putnam
(1954), Kaplan (1990, 95, footnote 6), and Fine (2007) have held that
&lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tully&rsquo; are synonyms, but
&lsquo;Cicero is Cicero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cicero is Tully&rsquo; are
not. They argue that the difference in meaning arises from the fact
that the former sentence encodes semantic co-reference between
&lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;, but the latter does not
encode coreference between &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Tully&rsquo;. They thereby propose principles weaker than
compositionality such as collective compositionality
(C\(_{\textit{coll}}\)):</p>

<p>
(C\(_{\textit{coll}}\)) For every complex expression <em>e</em> in
<em>L</em>, the meaning of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> is determined by
the structure of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> and the meanings of the
constituents of <em>e</em> in <em>L</em> collectively.</p>

<p>
On Fine&rsquo;s view, what the constituents of &lsquo;Cicero is
Cicero&rsquo; <em>collectively</em> mean goes beyond what the
constituents of &lsquo;Cicero is Tully&rsquo; do. The collective
meaning comprises the individual meanings plus certain
meaning-relations that hold among them. Call the weak principle
(C\(_{\textit{coll}}\)) <em>collective compositionality</em>;
following usual practice
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>
 will be understood as <em>distributive compositionality</em>.</p>

<p>
Fine thinks the meaning of &lsquo;Cicero is Cicero&rsquo; depends on
its structure (this is why it is not synonymous with &lsquo;Is Cicero
Cicero?&rsquo;), on the individual meanings of its constituents (this
is why it is not synonymous with &lsquo;Cicero is Caesar&rsquo;), and
<em>in addition</em> on the intended co-reference relation between the
subject and the object, which is an aspect of the collective meaning
of its constituents (this is why it is not synonymous with
&lsquo;Cicero is Tully&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
Fine (2007, 38) is explicit that this his approach is meant to be a
departure from standard conceptions of compositionality such as local
and global compositionality glossed above. This is certainly true of
the views of Putnam and Kaplan. It is debatable whether Fine&rsquo;s
own approach abandons many standard forms of compositionality. By
making the co-reference relation a separate input to the semantics,
Fine&rsquo;s view may preserve global compositionality; cf. Pickel and
Rabern
 2017.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="RevComBuiPri">2.2 Reverse Compositionality and the Building Principle</h3>

<p>
A commitment of compositionality as understood by
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>
 is that if two expressions have <em>different</em> meanings, then
they must either have <em>different</em> structures or some
corresponding pair of constituents must have <em>different</em>
meanings. <em>Reverse compositionality</em> say that this claim is
reversible: if two expressions have the <em>same</em> meaning, then
they must have the <em>same</em> structure, and all of their
corresponding constituents must have the <em>same</em> meaning. For
example, &lsquo;book thief&rsquo; and &lsquo;biblioklept&rsquo; have
different structures. So, by reverse compositionality, they must have
different meanings. Reverse compositionality neither entails nor is
entailed by compositionality understood as
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>.
 While
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>
 is a widely assumed principle in natural language semantics, reverse
compositionality is not. However, many debates in philosophy of mind
(especially those pertaining to connectionism) concern reverse
compositionality. (Fodor (1998b), Fodor &amp; Lepore (2001), and Pagin
(2003) advocate reverse compositionality; Patterson (2005), Robbins
(2005), and Johnson (2006) are among its opponents. The debate is
complex, in part because at least some proponents of reverse
compositionality advocate it only for the language of thought; cf.
Fodor 2001.) The issue is also discussed in connection with the
representational properties of images; see Isaac 2017.</p>

<p>
The claim that <em>L</em> is compositional is sometimes taken to mean
that the meaning of an arbitrary complex expression in <em>L</em> is
built up from the meanings of its constituents in
<em>L</em>&mdash;call this the <em>building principle</em> for
<em>L</em>. This is a fairly strong claim, at least if the building
metaphor is taken seriously. For then the meanings of complex
expressions must themselves be complex entities whose structure
mirrors that of the sentence; cf. Frege 1892, 1919. This presumably
entails but is not entailed by compositionality as understood by
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>;
 cf. Keller and Keller 2013 and Keller 2022. It also seems to entail
reverse compositionality.</p>

<h3 id="PriWor">2.3 The Primacy of Words</h3>

<p>
Often, to say that one thing determines another is to attribute causal
or explanatory priority. Although the principle of compositionality is
usually not understood in this way, sometimes philosophers read it as
a principle that asserts the priority of word meaning over sentence
meaning, or more generally, the priority of the meanings of lexical
items over the meanings of complex expressions:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="pointP">(P)</dt>
<dd>Complex expressions have their meanings in virtue of their
structure and the meanings of their constituents.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(P) is often thought to be in tension with the idea that each
expression has the meaning it does in virtue of the way it is used
within some linguistic community. The conflict is supposed to arise
because (i) the use of an expression is exhausted by its employment in
speech acts, and (ii) it is sentences, not words, that can be employed
to make speech acts. Against this, it can be argued that
<em>referring</em> is among the speech acts speakers routinely perform
and that this speech act is done with words, not sentences. One might
try to replace (i) with a stronger claim, for example, that the use of
an expression is exhausted by its employment in <em>asserting</em>,
<em>asking</em>, <em>commanding</em>, and a few of other speech acts
not including <em>referring</em>. But even if true the stronger claim
may not save the argument against (P) because, at least <em>prima
facie</em>, one can make assertions uttering isolated words; cf.
Stainton (2006). Davis (2003) develops a detailed theory of meaning
that combines (P) with a version of the use theory of meaning. (For
some arguments against
 <a href="#pointP">(P)</a>,
 see Szab&oacute; (2019).)</p>

<h3 id="ConPri">2.4 The Context Principle</h3>

<p>
Speakers do not learn the meanings of the constituent expressions in
isolation. Rather, speakers learn the meanings of many basic
expressions by seeing them used in the context of a complete sentence.
For example, one might learn the meaning of a number word such as the
word &lsquo;four&rsquo; by seeing it used in sentences such as
&lsquo;Jupiter has four moons&rsquo; rather than by confronting the
meaning of the word on its own.</p>

<p>
Considerations such as these led Frege to famously declare in section
60 of the <em>Foundations of Arithmetic</em> that only within a
complete sentence do words have meaning. This has come to be referred
to in the literature as Frege&rsquo;s <em>context principle</em>.
Frege writes that &ldquo;it is enough if the sentence as whole has
meaning; thereby also its parts obtain their meanings&rdquo; (Frege
[1884] 1950: section
 60).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 This context principle has many interpretations. On some
interpretations, the context principle conflicts with the principle of
compositionality. The <em>prima facie</em> tension between the context
principle and compositionality has been noted across times and
cultures. It was, for instance, raised and addressed in the tradition
of Prabh&#257;kara M&#299;m&#257;&#7747;s&#257; in classical Indian
philosophy; cf. Ollett 2020.</p>

<p>
Read literally, Frege&rsquo;s statement asserts that words have their
meanings in virtue of the meaning of sentences in which they occur as
constituents. This is incompatible with
 <a href="#pointP">(P)</a>,
 but not with
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>.
 Even if words are meaningful only because they occur as constituents
within sentences, there could still be a function that maps the
structure of a sentence and the meanings of its constituent words to
the meaning of that sentence. There would remain a sense in which the
meanings of the words determine the meanings of the sentences.</p>

<p>
There is an alternative way to construe Frege&rsquo;s context
principle, a way that makes it a determination claim, not a primacy
claim. To state it in a form that matches the generality of
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>,
 it must be generalized to apply to all complex expressions and their
constituents. On one interpretation (F\(_{\textit{all}}\)), the
meaning of an expression such as &lsquo;conquered&rsquo; is determined
by the meanings of the totality of expressions in which it occurs in a
constituent: &lsquo;Caesar conquered Gaul&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cicero
conquered Gaul&rsquo;, &lsquo;Caesar conquered Rome&rsquo;, and so
on.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag35em">
<dt id="pointFall">(F\(_{\textit{all}}\))</dt>
<dd>The meaning of an expression is determined by the meanings of all
complex expressions in which it occurs as a constituent.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
According to (F\(_{\textit{all}}\)), for the word
&lsquo;conquered&rsquo; to have a different meaning one of the
expressions it occurs in must have a different meaning. Like the
principle of compositionality, (F\(_{\textit{all}}\)) can be
interpreted as a claim about reference or meaning, locally or
globally, collectively or distributively, in a language-bound manner
or cross-linguistically. Compositionality is about bottom-up
meaning-determination, while the context principle about top-down
meaning-determination. As long as it is not understood as a causal or
explanatory relation determination can be symmetric, so any version of
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>
 is compatible with the corresponding version of
(F\(_{\textit{all}}\)).</p>

<p>
There is a strengthening of
 <a href="#pointFall">(F\(_{\textit{all}}\))</a>,
 according to which the meaning of an expression is determined not
only by the meanings of <em>all</em> expressions in which it occurs as
a constituent, but by the meaning of <em>any</em> one of these
expressions:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag35em">
<dt id="pointFany">(F\(_{\textit{any}}\))</dt>
<dd>The meaning of an expression is determined by the meaning of any
complex expression in which it occurs as a constituent.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If (F\(_{\textit{any}}\)) is true, then the meaning of
&lsquo;conquered&rsquo; is wholly fixed by the fact that &lsquo;Caesar
conquered Gaul&rsquo; means what it does. (F\(_{\textit{any}}\)) is an
immediate consequence of <em>reverse compositionality</em>.
 <a href="#pointFany">(F\(_{\textit{any}}\))</a>
 is incompatible with many standard semantic theories. For example, a
simple intensional semantics assigns to each sentence the set of
possible worlds where it is true. Consider a language that contains
the standard logical operators, and so any sentence is a constituent
of a necessarily true sentence. Since the meaning of a necessary truth
is the set of all possible worlds, this set would have to determine
the meanings of all sentences in the language, which is implausible.
There are principles of intermediate strength between
 <a href="#pointFall">(F\(_{\textit{all}}\))</a>
 and
 <a href="#pointFany">(F\(_{\textit{any}}\))</a>.
 These principles allow that the meaning of an expression may be fixed
by the meanings of some set or sets of complex expressions in which it
 occurs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="ArgForCom">3. Arguments for Compositionality</h2>

<p>
The simplest argument for compositionality is that it accords with the
ordinary experience of language. Human beings learn simple words and
grammatical structures. They often use their understanding of the
words and structures in order to understand more complex structures.
Although there are interesting putative counterexamples (see
 <a href="#HowComAllFai">section 3.2</a>),
 these can often be explained away through revisions of syntactic
and/or semantic theories. This argument is a reasonable starting
point, but its evidential value is limited. It does not fully
distinguish compositionality from related principles or show that it
applies in all cases. The pre-theoretic appeal of compositionality
will not convince those who find some of the proposed revisions
unacceptable. Moreover, this argument does not reveal the overall role
compositionality should play in semantic theory. This section will
explore two kinds of argument for compositionality. Empirical
arguments propose that compositionality best explains some linguistic
phenomenon. Methodological arguments propose that compositionality is
justified by the role it plays in semantic theories.</p>

<h3 id="EmpArg">3.1 Empirical Arguments</h3>

<p>
The empirical arguments for compositionality identify some particular
observed fact in need of explanation. They offer an explanation for
this fact in which compositionality is a central component. These
empirical arguments are not deductively valid arguments. The arguments
take the form of inferences to the best explanation. It is argued that
compositionality is part of the best explanation of some observed
fact. The arguments fail if a better explanation can be found for the
observed fact.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Productivity</h4>

<p>
The most common argument for compositionality is based on
productivity. The argument begins with the observation that speakers
can understand a large number of complex expressions they have never
before encountered. A speaker of English will understand the sentence
(8) even though they have never explicitly encountered that sentence
before.</p>

<p>
(8) A book thief will steal a short book before a long book because
short books better fit in large coats.</p>

<p>
This ability to understand novel complex expressions requires
explanation.</p>

<p>
To bolster the claim that speakers do, in fact, understand complex
expressions they have never heard before, philosophers often appeal to
<em>unboundedness</em>: although humans are finite beings, they have
the capacity to understand each of an infinitely large set of complex
expressions. Although there are dissenters&mdash;e.g., Ziff (1974) and
Pullum &amp; Scholz (2010)&mdash;the claim that natural languages
contain infinitely many complex expressions is
 plausible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 But it is equally plausible that nobody who reads this entry the
first time has ever encountered this very sentence before, and
consequently, the detour through cardinality considerations seems
superfluous.</p>

<p>
Speakers cannot so easily understand novel simple expressions. A
speaker who has never encountered the word &lsquo;lugubrious&rsquo;
before will need its meaning explained. The argument from productivity
is that compositionality is part of the best explanation of
speakers&rsquo; ability to understand novel complex expressions. The
argument can be found in Frege, who claimed that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the possibility of our understanding sentences which we have never
heard before rests evidently on this, that we can construct the sense
of a sentence out of parts that correspond to words. (Frege [c. 1914]
1980: 79)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The details of the argument can be expanded without assuming that
meanings are Fregean
 senses.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
How can a speaker&rsquo;s ability to understand novel complex
expressions such as (8) be explained? It can be explained by assuming
(Prod1) that (8) has constituents that are put together according to
certain rules; (Prod2) that speakers know the meanings of these
constituent expressions and know the rules for putting them together;
and (Prod3) that if anyone can understand some expressions and the
syntactic rules for deriving a complex expression out of these simpler
expressions, then they can understand the complex expression. Given
(Prod1), (Prod2), and (Prod3), the observed fact that speakers
understand (8) would be explained.</p>

<p>
Compositionality figures in this explanation because (Prod3) itself
needs to be explained. How can speakers pass from their understanding
of some more basic expressions and a syntactic rule for putting them
together to form a larger expression to understanding the meaning of
the complex expression? The argument from productivity assumes that
(Prod3) is best explained if some form of the principle of
compositionality is true, and the meaning of the complex is determined
by its structure and the meaning of its constituents.</p>

<p>
Occasionally, the fact that natural languages are <em>learnable</em>
is also used to argue for compositionality. This is not a wholly
independent argument: one reason it is remarkable that one can learn a
natural language is that once one has learnt it, one&rsquo;s
understanding is productive. If one could not understand expressions
one has never encountered before without detailed empirical study,
then it might be that the language was learned by rote memorization.
That said, compositionality may explain the fact that natural
languages are learnable by constraining the space of hypotheses about
the meanings of the complex expressions of the language; cf. Del Pinal
2015.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Systematicity</h4>

<p>
Another argument for compositionality is based on
<em>systematicity</em>, the fact that there are definite and
predictable patterns among the sentences a speaker understands. In
particular, the observed datum is that speakers can generally
understand grammatical recombinations of sentences they already
understand. A speaker who understands the sentences &lsquo;the dog is
asleep&rsquo; and &lsquo;the cat is awake&rsquo; can generally
understand the sentences &lsquo;the dog is awake&rsquo; and &lsquo;the
cat is asleep&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Like the argument from productivity, the argument from
<em>systematicity</em> seeks to explain how speakers can go from their
understanding of some portion of the language to their understanding
of novel sentences. The portion of the language that a speaker is
assumed to understand is a set of sentences. The novel expressions are
those that result from permuting the basic vocabulary.</p>

<p>
The explanation is meant to run as follows: (Sys1) A speaker who
understands some complex expressions understands the rules that
generate it and knows the meanings of its constituents; (Sys2)
speakers who understands the rules that generate a complex expression
can apply it to other expressions they understand; and (Sys3) if a
speaker understands the meanings of some constituent expressions and
understands a rule for putting them together, then the speaker can
understand the complex expression that results from putting the basic
expressions together. A speaker who understands &lsquo;the dog is
asleep&rsquo; and &lsquo;the cat is awake&rsquo; can also understand
the constituents &lsquo;the dog&rsquo;, &lsquo;the cat&rsquo;,
&lsquo;is asleep&rsquo;, and &lsquo;is awake&rsquo; and the rule for
combining noun phrases and verb phrases. The speaker who understands
these words and the rule for combining noun phrases and verb phrases
is able to understand &lsquo;the dog is awake&rsquo; and &lsquo;the
cat is asleep&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Again, compositionality is meant to explain assumption (Sys3).
Speakers are able to know the meanings of complex expressions from
their knowledge of the meanings of basic expressions and their
knowledge of the rules for putting these expressions together because
the meanings of the complex expressions are determined by the meaning
of the complex expressions.</p>

<p>
The argument from systematicity exhibits some important differences
from the argument from productivity. One difference is in the
plausibility of the purported fact to be explained. There are many
examples where speakers are able to understand recombinations of
expressions that they already understand. However, it is unclear how
far to generalize this claim. Do all who understand &lsquo;within an
hour&rsquo; and &lsquo;without a watch&rsquo; also understand
&lsquo;within a watch&rsquo; and &lsquo;without an hour&rsquo;? And do
all who understand &lsquo;halfway closed&rsquo; and &lsquo;firmly
believed&rsquo; also understand &lsquo;halfway believed&rsquo; and
&lsquo;firmly closed&rsquo;? As Johnson (2004) argues, the claim that
natural languages are systematic presupposes a natural non-overlapping
linguistic categorization of all the expressions. The claim that in
understanding a sentence one must be able to understand its
constituents is related to reverse compositionality; cf. section
1.4.2; Fodor &amp; Lepore 2001: 59; Pagin 2003:
 292.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The arguments also differ because the systematicity argument aims to
explain a speaker&rsquo;s ability to understand novel sentences in
terms of their existing ability to understand whole sentences. It may
be that in understanding the reconfigurations of the already
understood sentences, speakers appeal not only to the meanings of the
parts of the sentence but also to the meanings of the whole sentences.
So, the speaker may use their understanding of the whole sentences
&lsquo;the dog is asleep&rsquo; and &lsquo;the cat is awake&rsquo;
(and all of their constituents) to understand the novel sentence
&lsquo;the dog is awake&rsquo;. This is compatible with the
possibility that it is not merely the structure and meanings of the
constituents that determine the meaning of the complex expression, but
also the meanings of various other complex expressions. This is not to
say that the latter explanation is better, but only that the
assumption that the speaker has more knowledge makes available
explanations that are not available in the argument from
productivity.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Challenges to the Empirical Arguments</h4>

<p>
There are many challenges to these empirical arguments in the
literature. One of the most prominent challenges purports to offer a
better explanation of the fact that speakers can know the meaning of a
complex expression by knowing the rule for constructing the expression
and knowing the meanings of its constituents.</p>

<p>
Here is an alternative explanation: the claim that the complex
expression has a certain meaning is <em>computable</em> from the claim
that it results from applying a certain rule to certain constituent
expressions and from the claim that the constituents have certain
meanings. One claim is computable from a set of claims when there is
an effective procedure deriving a claim from the set of claims. The
explanation of systematicity would require this: the claim that
&lsquo;the dog is asleep&rsquo; means <em>that the dog is asleep</em>
is computable from the claims (for example) that &lsquo;the dog is
asleep&rsquo; results from combining &lsquo;the dog&rsquo; and
&lsquo;is asleep&rsquo;, that &lsquo;the dog&rsquo; means <em>the
dog</em>, and that &lsquo;is asleep&rsquo; means <em>is asleep</em>.
This explanation does not require compositionality, because the
computation may appeal to factors other than the structure and the
meanings of &lsquo;the dog&rsquo; and &lsquo;is asleep&rsquo;. For
example, the computation of the claim that &lsquo;the dog is
asleep&rsquo; means <em>that the dog is asleep</em> might appeal to
the expressions &lsquo;the dog&rsquo; and &lsquo;is asleep&rsquo;
themselves and not merely to their meanings; cf. Schiffer 1987, 1991,
Pagin 2012, Dever 2005.</p>

<p>
A more recent challenge comes from large language models (LLMs). LLMs
produce coherent strings of text similar to those produced by natural
speakers by repeatedly predicting the next word from an input string
of text. The models associate a long vector with each basic expression
(or &ldquo;tokens&rdquo;) and derives a series of vectors for strings
of vectors in terms of the vectors of the basic expressions making up
the string. The final derived vector gives rise to a probability
distribution for the next word. The values of the vectors are set by
training on a large body of text, cf. (Wolfram 2023). The training
data include far more sentences than any normal human being is exposed
to. However, LLMs can produce and process novel sentences on the basis
of this training data. The question is whether LLMs encode anything
like a recursive syntax or compositional semantics for these
languages. If they do not, then this poses a problem for the arguments
for compositionality appealing to productivity and systematicity,
because then LLMs would be examples of systems that display competence
with novel sentences and the ability to recombine existing sentences
without compositionally processing them. Because of the size of the
vectors associated with words and the complexity of the computations,
separating out elements of the representation is challenging. This
project is the subject of ongoing research. See Lake and Baroni 2018
and Dankers et al. 2022.</p>

<p>
A final challenge to the empirical arguments is that they do not
conclusively establish compositionality as a universal claim. General
considerations of productivity and systematicity cannot rule out
isolated <em>exceptions</em> to compositionality. Suppose someone
suggests that the complex expression <em>e</em> is a counterexample to
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>.
 The fact that speakers tend to understand all sorts of complex
expressions they have never heard before does not mean that they would
understand <em>e</em> on the first encounter. Similarly, the fact that
speakers can generally understand a new sentence by reconfiguring
words in a sentence they already understand does not entail that they
would understand <em>e</em>. Even if <em>in general</em> humans
understand complex expressions they have never heard before in virtue
of their knowledge of the expressions&rsquo; structures and the
meanings of the constituents, speakers might understand <em>e</em> in
some other way.</p>

<h3 id="Met">3.2 Methodology</h3>

<p>
A popular reason for believing in compositionality is that it works.
According to this argument, compositionality has been a high-level
empirical hypothesis that is not directly related to observation.
Rather, linguists have adopted various versions of the principle of
compositionality as a working hypothesis and developed semantic
theories on their basis.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Compositionality is a powerful working hypothesis, but it is well
known that it can&rsquo;t be an empirical hypothesis all by itself.
(Partee 2004: 14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In some cases, broad frameworks such as Montague semantics have been
motivated, in part, by the appeal to various versions of the principle
of compositionality. The resulting theories have provided intuitively
satisfactory explanations for a wide range of linguistic data, such as
the validity or invalidity of inferences or contrasts in acceptability
between minimal pairs. Moreover, when certain phenomena appeared to
conflict with compositionality, it was usually shown that this is not
so: reasonably elegant and comparatively natural compositional
theories were just around the corner; cf. section 3.2. Finally,
compositionality (or its specific implementations) has also been
invoked to motivate narrower interventions in syntactic or semantic
theory (e.g. Partee 1975, 511-513).</p>

<p>
There are two components to the argument from methodology. The first
component is a concession, that compositionality is not directly
testable. This concession is motivated by various trivialization
arguments that have been introduced. The second component is that the
success of semantic theories does provide indirect evidence for
compositionality.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 The Empirical Significance of Compositionality</h4>

<p>
Compositionality alone has few direct empirical implications. To
substantively constrain semantic theorizing, compositionality must be
paired with auxiliary hypotheses about syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>
Janssen (1983) proved that one can turn any meaning assignment on a
recursively enumerable set of expressions into a compositional one, if
one can replace the syntactic operations with different ones. This
shows that for compositionality to remain substantive, the semantic
theory must be paired with some auxiliary hypotheses about the
syntactic structure of complex expressions; cf. Westerst&aring;hl
 1998.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
From the side of semantics, Zadrozny (1994) showed that starting with
an assignment of meanings to the expressions of a language, one can
generate a new compositional assignment of meanings that encode the
original meanings. Given a set <em>S</em> of strings generated from an
arbitrary alphabet via concatenation and a meaning function <em>m</em>
which assigns the members of an arbitrary set <em>M</em> to the
members of <em>S</em>, one can construct a new meaning function
\(\mu\) such that for all \(s, t \in S \mu(s{.}t) = \mu(s)(\mu(t))\)
and \(\mu(s)(s) = m(s)\). Zadrozny&rsquo;s argument shows that
compositionality alone does not constrain the meanings of the complex
expressions provided that the meanings of the simpler expressions can
be replaced with new &ldquo;meanings&rdquo; from which the old are
uniformly
 recoverable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 (Cf. Kazmi and Pelletier (1998), Westerst&aring;hl (1998), Dever
(1999).)</p>

<p>
Horwich (1997) offers an argument that compositionality does not
constrain the meanings of the basic expressions, either. He considers
the view that the meanings of complex expressions are phrase structure
trees with the meanings of the constituent lexical items assigned to
their terminal nodes. The meanings of complexes are straightforwardly
determined from the meanings of the simple expressions together with
their syntactic mode of composition. This shows that if the semantic
theory is lax enough with the meanings assigned to the complex
expressions, any assignment of meanings to basic expressions is
compatible with the principle of
 compositionality.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
These results show that for compositionality to be a substantive
constraint on natural language theorizing, it must be paired with
background constraints on syntax, the semantics of the basic lexical
items, and the semantics of composites (cf. Dever
 2008).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4>3.2.2 Compositionality as Hypothesis</h4>

<p>
The principle of compositionality has been a successful working
hypothesis in linguistics. Does this give evidence to believe it? This
depends on the role that compositionality plays in the success of
linguistic theory. A high-level methodological hypothesis might be
adopted for a subject matter for reasons of methodological simplicity
or to commence an investigation. It may thereby lead to a successful
theory without playing any role in that success. If this were the
case, then there might be no reason to believe the principle of
compositionality. Of course, this is compatible with using the
principle as an instrumental hypothesis in semantics.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it may be that investigation reveals that
compositionality is an important part of the explanation of various
phenomena under the scope of the theory. These phenomena might include
observations about productivity and systematicity, discussed in
section 2.2.1. If this were the case, then these empirical arguments
for compositionality would each individually provide the principle
with some indirect empirical
 evidence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="ArgAgaCom">4. Arguments Against Compositionality</h2>

<p>
The most prominent arguments against compositionality come from
apparent counterexamples. Putative counterexamples to
 <a href="#pointC">(C)</a>
 are complex expressions whose meaning appears to depend not only on
the meanings of their constituents and on their structure but on some
<em>third factor</em> as well. The third factor might be the context
in which the sentence is used (&sect;3.2.1 and &sect;3.2.4), its
linguistic environment (&sect;3.2.3), auxiliary conventions
(&sect;3.2.2), or someone&rsquo;s beliefs about what the expression
means (&sect;3.2.5).</p>

<p>
In each case, compositionality is not the only hypothesis generating
the counterexample. The counterexamples depend on auxiliary hypotheses
about syntactic structure and about the meanings of the constituent
expressions. In many cases, compositionality can be maintained by
revising some of these auxiliary hypotheses. The choice between
revising compositionality and revising an auxiliary hypothesis will
depend on complicated theoretical constraints.</p>

<h3 id="HowComMigFai">4.1 How Compositionality Might Fail</h3>

<p>
Before surveying the putative counterexamples to compositionality from
the semantics literature, consider a simple non-linguistic case where
speakers&rsquo; understanding is productive and systematic despite
apparent lack of compositionality in the system of representations.
Specifically, consider the Algebraic notation for
 chess.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Here are the basics. The rows of the chessboard are represented by
the numerals \(\b{1},\b{2}, \ldots ,\b{8}\); the columns are
represented by the lower-case letters \(\ba, \bb, \ldots ,\bh\). The
squares are identified by column and row; for example \(\b{b5}\) is at
the intersection of the second column from the left and the fifth row
from the top. Upper-case letters represent the pieces: \(\bK\) stands
for king, \(\bQ\) for queen, \(\bR\) for rook, \(\bB\) for bishop, and
\(\bN\) for knight. Moves are typically represented by a triplet
consisting of an upper-case letter standing for the piece that makes
the move and a sign standing for the square where the piece moves.
Moves made by pawns lack the upper-case letter from the beginning.
When more than one piece of the same type could reach the same square,
the sign for the square of departure is placed immediately in front of
the sign for the square of arrival. Finally, there are symbols for
special moves such as castling, for check, and for making commentaries
about moves.</p>

<p>
Someone who understands the Algebraic notation can follow descriptions
of particular chess games and, in particular, can tell <em>which</em>
move is represented by particular lines within such a description.
Nonetheless, in isolation, the line \(\b{Nb5}\) is not be enough to
figure out what this move is supposed to be. It must be a move to
\(\b{b5}\) made by a knight. However, the square from which it moves
is unspecified. All this can be determined by following the
description of the game from the beginning, assuming that one knows
what the initial configurations of figures are on the chessboard, that
white moves first, and that afterwards black and white move one after
the other. But staring at \(\b{Nb5}\) itself will not help.</p>

<p>
The first moral of the example is that one can have a productive and
systematic understanding of representations even if one does not
understand complex representations <em>merely</em> by understanding
their simple components and the way those components are combined. The
reason this could happen is that all who understand the system know
certain things (e.g., the initial configuration of pieces and the
order of moves) from which they can figure out the missing information
(e.g., which figure is moving and from where).</p>

<p>
The second moral is that given certain assumptions about meaning in
chess notation we can have productive and systematic understanding of
representations even if the system itself is not compositional. The
assumptions in question are that (a) the description in the first
paragraph of this section fully determines what the simple expressions
of chess notation mean and also how they can be combined to form
complex expressions, and that (b) the meaning of a line within a chess
notation determines a move. These assumptions are auxiliary
hypotheses.</p>

<p>
The third moral is that one can maintain compositionality by rejecting
the auxiliary hypotheses such as (a) and (b). One can reject (a) by
arguing that the meaning of \(\bN\) in \(\b{Nb5}\) contains an
indexical component, it picks out a particular knight moving from a
particular square. One can also reject (b) by arguing that the meaning
of \(\b{Nb5}\) is nothing more than the meaning of &lsquo;some knight
moves from somewhere to square \(\b{b5}\)&rsquo;&mdash;utterances of
\(\b{Nb5}\) might carry extra information but that is of no concern
for the semantics of the notation. Both moves would save
compositionality at a trade-off. To make rejecting (a) worthwhile, one
would have to explain how the meaning of \(\bN\) depends on context.
To rejecting (b) worthwhile, one would have to explain how the move
can be determined from the meaning of the utterance of \(\b{Nb5}\)
combined with the background information; cf. Pickel and Rabern
2022.</p>

<h3 id="HowComAllFai">4.2 How Compositionality Allegedly Fails</h3>

<p>
This section discusses several famous putative counterexamples to the
compositionality of English from the semantics literature. The list is
by no means exhaustive. (For a more systematic survey of how
compositionality problems are typically solved in formal semantics,
see Zimmerman 2012.) For each putative counterexample, there are
possible responses considered below.</p>

<h4>4.2.1 Possessives </h4>

<p>
An utterance of &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s horse&rsquo; can refer to a horse
that belongs to Mary, a horse that she is riding, a horse that she has
placed a bet on, and so on. &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s portrait&rsquo; can be
used to refer to a portrait that belongs to Mary or to a portrait in
which she is the subject. Thus, the complex expressions
&lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s horse&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s
portrait&rsquo; appear to be context sensitive. But, the context
sensitivity does not seem to trace to the constituents
&lsquo;Mary&rsquo;, &lsquo;horse&rsquo;, or &lsquo;portrait&rsquo;.
These are a putative counterexample to the compositionality of
occasion meaning. This counterexample can be accepted or background
assumptions can be revised. One way to preserve the compositionality
of occasion meaning would be to take the possessive construction as
contributing a context-sensitive constituent. See (Partee 1997).</p>

<h4>4.2.2 Idioms </h4>

<p>
Idioms pose a more complicated challenge to compositionality. Idioms
include complex expressions with conventionalized meanings. For
example, in English, the sentence &lsquo;Mary kicked the bucket&rsquo;
can mean that Mary died. There is no obvious way to derive this
meaning from the meanings of the parts. Thus, idioms seem to be
isolated exceptions to compositionality. Jackendoff (1997) estimates
the number of English idioms to be around twenty-five thousand.</p>

<p>
Defenders of compositionality sometimes argue that the syntactic
complexity of these expressions is only apparent, and hence, they can
be viewed as lexical items. That is, the expression &lsquo;kicked the
bucket&rsquo; might be taken as a single atomic expression of English
that means died (in addition to being a complex expression of English
that means &lsquo;kicks the bucket&rsquo;). But unless there are clear
non-semantic grounds for singling out idioms, the move is
question-begging. Such criteria have been proposed, but they tend to
be rather controversial; cf. Nunberg, Sag, and Wasow 1994. Another
approach to defending compositionality is to argue that the idiomatic
meaning of these expressions is metaphorical. That is, even if the
idiomatic meaning is conventionalized, it remains metaphorical. It may
be that different responses are appropriate for different idioms.</p>

<h4>4.2.3 Cross-sentential anaphora</h4>

<p>
Consider the following minimal pair from Barbara Partee:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(9)</dt>
<dd>I dropped ten marbles and found all but one of them. It is
probably under the sofa.</dd>
<dt>(10)</dt>
<dd>I dropped ten marbles and found nine of them. It is probably under
the sofa.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Sentence (9) is unproblematic, and sentence (10) is markedly odd. This
difference is plausibly a matter of meaning, and so (9) and (10)
cannot be synonyms. Nonetheless, the first sentences are at least
truth-conditionally equivalent. If necessary equivalence is sufficient
for synonymy, then this is an apparent counterexample to
compositionality.</p>

<p>
One response would deny that the first sentences of (9) and (10) are
fully synonymous. What is interesting about this example is that it is
not immediately clear how a more fine-grained account of meaning will
account for the contrast between these sentences. The difference is
obviously due to the fact that &lsquo;one&rsquo; occurs in the first
sentence of (9), which is available as a proper antecedent for
&lsquo;it&rsquo; and that there is nothing in the first sentence of
(10) that could play a similar role. Some authors have suggested that
the right way to approach this problem is to opt for a dynamic
conception of meaning, one that can encode anaphoric possibilities for
subsequent sentences (Kamp 1981; Heim 1982; Groenendijk &amp; Stokhof
1990, 1991; Zeevat 1989; and Chierchia 1995). See entries on
 <a href="../anaphora/">anaphora</a>,
 <a href="../dynamic-semantics/">dynamic semantics</a>,
 and
 <a href="../discourse-representation-theory/">discourse representation theory</a>.</p>
 
<h4>4.2.4 Context Sensitivity</h4>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s call expressions whose occasion meaning sometimes deviates
from their standing meaning <em>context-dependent</em>. The scope of
context-dependent lexical items is a matter of controversy.
<em>Semantic minimalists</em> hold that there are only a handful of
context-dependent expressions: the personal and demonstrative
pronouns, a few adverbs (e.g., &lsquo;here&rsquo;, &lsquo;now&rsquo;,
&lsquo;next&rsquo;), and a few adjectives (e.g. &lsquo;actual&rsquo;,
&lsquo;present&lsquo;, &lsquo;local&rsquo;); cf. Borg 2004 and
Cappelen and Lepore 2005 . <em>Radical contextualists</em> hold that
essentially all lexical items are context-dependent; e.g., Searle
(1980). Many theorists are somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>
Radical contextualism is sometimes seen as a challenge to
compositionality, more precisely, to
 <a href="#pointCocc">(C\(_{\textit{occ}}\))</a>;
 cf. Cohen 1986, Lahav 1989, Fodor 2001. An effective argument from
context-dependence against
 <a href="#pointCocc">(C\(_{\textit{occ}}\))</a>
 would need to show that there is at least one complex expression in
<em>L</em> whose occasion meaning varies with context, while the
occasion meanings of its constituents all remain the same. Suppose a
Japanese maple leaf, turned brown, has been painted green. Consider
someone pointing at this leaf uttering (11):</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(11)</dt>
<dd>This leaf is green.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The utterance could be true on one occasion (when the speaker is
sorting leaves for decoration) and false on another (when the speaker
is identifying the species of tree the leaf belongs to). The meanings
of the words are the same on both occasions and so is their syntactic
composition. But the meaning of (11) on these two occasions&mdash;what
(11) <em>says</em> when uttered in these occasions&mdash;is different.
As Charles Travis, the inventor of this example puts it:
&ldquo;&hellip;words may have all the stipulated features while saying
something true, but also while saying something false&rdquo; (Travis
1994: 171&ndash;172; see also Travis 1996 and Lahav 1989).</p>

<p>
There are many possible responses to this challenge to the
compositionality of occasion meaning. One is to deny the relevant
intuition. Perhaps the leaf really is green if it is painted green and
(11) is uttered truly in both situations. Nonetheless, one might be
sometimes reluctant to make such a true utterance for fear of being
misleading. One might be taken to falsely suggest that the leaf is
green under the paint or that it is not painted at all (cf. Sainsbury
2001 and Berg 2002). The second option would be to hold that the
context sensitivity of this example can be traced to the context
sensitivity of a constituent expression, &lsquo;green&rsquo; (Dancy
2003, Szab&oacute; 2010, Lasersohn 2012, Recanati 2012, and Borg
 2016).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 A third option would be that the compositionally determined occasion
meaning falls short of determining a truth condition or proposition,
but only propositional constraints (Bach 1994, Soames 2005, Buchanan
2010, Harris 2020).</p>

<h4>4.2.5 Propositional attitudes</h4>

<p>
A final and widely known objection to compositionality comes from the
observation that even if \(e\) and \(e'\) are synonyms, the
truth-values of sentences where they occur embedded within the clausal
complement of a mental attitude verb often appear to differ. So,
despite the fact that &lsquo;biblioklepts&rsquo; and &lsquo;book
thieves&rsquo; are synonyms, apparently (12) may be true and (13)
false:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(12)</dt>
<dd>Carla believes that biblioklepts steal.</dd>
<dt>(13)</dt>
<dd>Carla believes that book thieves steal.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This pair apparently violates compositionality; cf. Pelletier
(1994).</p>

<p>
There is a sizable literature on the semantics of
 <a href="../prop-attitude-reports/">propositional attitude reports</a>
 (see entry). Some think that considerations like this show that there
are no genuine synonyms in natural languages. If so, compositionality
is trivialized. Some deny the intuition that (12) and (13) may differ
in truth-conditions and seek explanations for the contrary appearance
in terms of
 implicature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 Still others abandon compositionality but still provide recursive
semantic
 clauses.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 Finally, some preserve compositionality by postulating a hidden
indexical associated with &lsquo;believe&rsquo; (Richard 1990,
Crimmins &amp; Perry 1989, and Crimmins 1992).</p>
