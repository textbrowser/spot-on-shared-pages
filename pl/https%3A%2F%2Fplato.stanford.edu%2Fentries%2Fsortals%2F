<h1>Sortals</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 9, 2006; substantive revision Mon Jul 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Sortals have played an instrumental role in resolving various
theoretical challenges. They have helped tackle significant problems
in multiple areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, philosophy of
language, and philosophy of mind. Beyond philosophy, sortal concepts
have proven relevant in psychological fields, especially in theories
related to infant cognitive development and human perception.
Moreover, they have been applied in computer science, notably in
artificial intelligence and knowledge representation.</p>

<p>
Despite its importance, the notion of a sortal remains vague and
ambiguous. There are conflicting interpretations of this notion, and
authors write at cross-purposes. As a result, readers of any text
about sortals should approach the subject with caution. This confusion
partly stems from its origin as a technical term introduced by John
Locke in 1690, who focused on concepts that define the essence of
things. Later philosophers have reinterpreted the term to align with
their philosophical goals, leading to a situation where the criteria
for what constitutes a sortal predicate can vary. For instance, Peter
Strawson, who revived the term in 1959, emphasized sortals as
providing criteria for counting. For their part, Wiggins (1967, 2001)
looked at sortals as telling us what a thing is, Dummett (1973) as
providing persistence criteria, Quine (1964) as a predicate that
divides its reference, and Geach (1980) as conveying identity
criteria. In general, most of the authors working with the notion of a
sortal have proposed one or more of the following interpretations:
</p>

<ol>

<li>A sortal defines the essence of a thing or, at the very least,
provides an answer to the question &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</li>

<li>A sortal offers a principle of individuation, enabling us to
single out an entity</li>

<li>A sortal establishes criteria for identity and differentiation,
specifying when something is the same as or different from a given
object</li>

<li>A sortal provides a persistence criterion, determining when
something continues or ceases to exist</li>
</ol>

<p>
These different characterizing features of sortals are not necessarily
independent. For example, counting criteria presupposes identity and
differentiation criteria, and the same applies to persistence
criteria. It is also claimed that a principle of individuation entails
identity and differentiation criteria.</p>

<p>
In addition to the above, grammatical criteria have also been adopted.
It has been claimed that sortal predicates admit the definite article,
the plural ending, the pronouns &ldquo;same&rdquo;,
&ldquo;other&rdquo;, and &ldquo;another&rdquo;, and quantity words
such as &ldquo;all&rdquo;, &ldquo;many&rdquo;, and &ldquo;one&rdquo;,
&ldquo;two&rdquo;, &ldquo;three&rdquo;, etc. These features have
suggested the idea of developing specific formal logics for
sortals.</p>

<p>
The longstanding debate on the so-called problem of universals has
also complicated the discussions surrounding sortals. Various
positions-nominalism, realism, and conceptualism- have been proposed
as potential solutions to the problem, each supported by different
arguments for and against them. Different approaches to sortals can be
contextualized within this spectrum of solutions. From a realist
perspective, sortals are seen as properties; from a conceptualist
view, they are regarded as concepts. Nominalist, on the other hand,
consider sortals merely as predicates. For instance, from the
nominalist perspective, words like &ldquo;dog&rdquo;,
&ldquo;house&rdquo;, and &ldquo;animal&rdquo; would be considered
sortals. From the conceptualist perspective, the concept of a dog,
house or animal would be viewed as sortals. From the realist
perspective, the property of being a dog, a house, or animal would
count as sortals. Works on sortals can be generally classified under
one of the three perspectives.</p>

<p>
Despite the above complexities, we find common ground for the
different philosophical approaches in the various prototypes of what
counts as a sortal or non-sortal predicate. These prototypes have
contributed to grounding the defining criteria and guided discussions
on this subject. In general, it is widely accepted that most or many
common count nouns are sortals, while most adjectives and intransitive
verbs are generally not. For example, expressions like
&ldquo;book&rdquo;, &ldquo;horse&rdquo;, and &ldquo;car&rdquo; are
typically considered sortals, and those like &ldquo;red&rdquo;,
&ldquo;aromatic&rdquo;, &ldquo;stiff&rdquo;, &ldquo;deafening&rdquo;,
&ldquo;cold&rdquo;, &ldquo;bitter&rdquo;, &ldquo;cry&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;borrow&rdquo; are not.</p>

<p>
Most nouns that are not sortals can form sortals in contexts where a
unit is implicated, often without the supplementary unit being
explicit. Coffee and gold are not sortals by most accounts, but we can
intelligibly ask how many coffees Harry drank or how many golds the
ski team won. It is understood from context that we are asking about
<em>cups of coffee</em> and <em>gold medals</em>. These unitized
sortals can be in any of the forms discussed above.</p>

<h2 id="ThrMaiIssSor">1. Three main issues on sortals</h2>

<p>
The above points to three clear issues regarding sortals. The first
concerns the very notion of a sortal. As we have noted, this notion
has always been technical in nature, historically determined, and
somewhat theory-laden. Thus, it is crucial to clarify its underlying
elements separately and within a historical context to grasp what its
content involves. We will focus our attention on these points in
sections 2&ndash;9.</p>

<p>
The second issue addresses the logic of sortals. This arises from
examining the grammatical criteria associated with sortals, such as
their use in constructions involving relative quantifiers and
identity. These features suggest the need to develop a logic
incorporating these characteristics. Additionally, different
interpretations of sortals-particularly from the theory of
universals-could result in varying reasoning principles. In section
11, we will present the different logical theories of sortals that
have been developed thus far.</p>

<p>
Finally, the third issue addresses the potential applications of
sortals across various fields. As noted earlier, sortals have played a
role in resolving specific philosophical issues, as well as in
psychological research and advancements in artificial intelligence. In
sections
 <a href="#SorTheRolCog">10</a>
 and
 <a href="#SorArtInt">12</a>,
 we will explore these applications in psychology and artificial
intelligence, respectively. Philosophical issues will be discussed
throughout the article. </p>

<h2 id="NatSor">2. The nature of a sortal</h2>

<p>
As mentioned above, the nature of a sortal has been historically
shaped by its historical introduction and subsequent evolution under
the influence of various philosophical perspectives. The following
exposition intends to capture this development. We will start by
tracing the history of the concept of a sortal, exploring how various
philosophers have interpreted and developed the idea over time. In
some instances, we will highlight how the concept has been influenced
by philosophical theories that address specific philosophical issues.
In this exposition, we will distinguish between two key times: the
pre-1959 period and the late 1950&rsquo;s and subsequent years
period.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the defining features of sortals, in line with
various philosophical contexts, have been interpreted differently.
These variations have led to diverse understandings of the notion of a
sortal. These interpretations will be examined in relation to the
various criteria proposed as constitutive of the content purportedly
conveyed by sortals.</p>

<h2 id="Pre195VieSor">3. Pre-1959 views on sortals</h2>

<p>
Many philosophers (e.g., Wallace 1965) have claimed that the notion of
a sortal is the same notion as developed by Aristotle under the label
&ldquo;secondary substance&rdquo; in several of his writings. However,
this concept is complex and controversial (see Furth 1988 and the
entry on Aristotle metaphysics
 <a href="../aristotle-metaphysics/">Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysics</a>).
 For this reason, the present discussion will not pursue the
connection further.</p>

<p>
The first use of the term &ldquo;sortal&rdquo; is in Locke&rsquo;s
<em>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1975 [1690]).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But it being evident, that things are ranked under Names into sorts or
<em>Species</em>&hellip;the <em>Essence</em> of each <em>Genus</em>,
or Sort, comes to be nothing but that abstract <em>Idea</em>, which
the General, or <em>Sortal</em> (if I may have leave so to call it,
from <em>Sort</em>, as I do <em>General</em> from <em>Genus</em>) Name
stands for. And this we shall find to be that, which the word
<em>Essence</em> imports, in its most familiar use. (Bk.III, Ch.III,
15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke goes on to distinguish between real essences, which are mostly
hidden from us and determined by nature, and nominal essences, which
we (somewhat) arbitrarily construct, but doesn&rsquo;t say which he
means to pick out by the expression &ldquo;sortal&rdquo;. It is ironic
that in discussion of the history of the term Locke and Aristotle are
cited as the two historical sources, when a main point of
Locke&rsquo;s <em>Essay</em> was to argue against Aristotelian
essentialism (see the entry on
 <a href="../locke/">Locke</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Roughly contemporaneously with Locke&rsquo;s introduction of the term,
Spinoza noted the importance of a sortal like term for counting though
he did not use the term &ldquo;sortal&rdquo; or a Latin
equivalent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
He who holds in his hand a penny and a dollar will not think of the
number two, unless he can call both the penny and the dollar piece by
one and the same name, to wit, a piece of money or a coin. (Spinoza
1674: 259)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The other pre-twentieth century author who is frequently cited as an
antecedent of contemporary discussions is Frege. In Frege (1884) he
makes the point that in counting things, we need to know what kind of
thing we are counting. For example, something can be counted as one
thing, a deck of cards, or as fifty-two cards. Frege was perhaps the
first to use the phrase (which is translated as) &ldquo;criterion of
identity&rdquo;. There is disagreement about whether Frege intended
his remarks to apply to all kinds of identity, as Dummett (1973)
argues, or only to numbers, as Lowe (1989) argues, but Dummett&rsquo;s
is the more common interpretation.</p>

<p>
Wright (1983) argues that one of Frege&rsquo;s most important
contributions was emphasizing that numbers are objects and that this
is intimately connected to Frege&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;natural
number&rdquo; is a sortal. Wright is aware of the difficulties in
characterizing sortals but remarks that &ldquo;&hellip;whether or not
it is ultimately rigorously explicable, the intuitive notion of a
sortal concept is clear enough for our immediate purpose&rdquo; (1983:
4). For further discussion see the entry on
 <a href="../frege/">Frege</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="Lat50sSubYea">4. Late 50s and subsequent years </h2>

<p>
The expression &ldquo;sortal&rdquo; reappeared on the philosophical
stage in the 1950s and 1960s in lectures and in the written work of
Strawson (1959), Quine (1960), Geach (1962), and Wiggins (1967) and
variations on the concept entered the mainstream philosophical
vocabulary. Because philosophers lecture and circulate manuscripts
with their ideas for years&mdash;sometimes decades&mdash;before
publication, the dates of the main publications of the protagonists
concerning sortals do not necessarily reflect the historical
priorities and influences. The most accurate simple summary is that
the ideas of Geach, Strawson and Quine co-evolved and that
Wiggins&rsquo; writings built on a foundation laid by those
predecessors.</p>

<p>
The widespread use of the term &ldquo;sortal&rdquo; definitely derives
from Strawson, but readers should note that there are important
differences among these authors. For a start, Strawson applies
&ldquo;sortal&rdquo; to universals, Quine to predicates, and Wiggins
to concepts. In this way, these authors illustrate the realist,
nominalist, and conceptualist interpretations of sortals&rsquo; nature
that we presented earlier.</p>

<p>
For his part, Geach did not use the word &ldquo;sortal&rdquo; but most
commentators identify his notion of a &ldquo;substantival
expression&rdquo; with &ldquo;sortal&rdquo; in the other writers.
While Geach appears to align more closely to Quine, given that
&ldquo;expression&rdquo; seems to be a linguistic concept, Geach
extends his conclusions across languages in ways that Quine would
likely dispute. These variations in terminology among the four authors
would not be important, if there were straightforward, universally
agreed upon connections between concepts, universals, and expressions.
But there aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>
Strawson made no mention of Locke, Aristotle, Spinoza or Frege in the
context of introducing the expression &ldquo;sortal universal&rdquo;
in <em>Individuals</em> in 1959.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A sortal universal supplies a principle for distinguishing and
counting individual particulars which it collects. (1959: 168) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Strawson had two main projects in <em>Individuals</em>. The first was
to show that material bodies and persons occupy a central position
among particulars and that items in these two categories are basic to
our conceptual scheme. The second was to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
establish and explain the connection between the idea of a particular
in general and that of an object of reference or logical subject.
(1959: 11&ndash;12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sortal universals are central to this second task because, according
to Strawson, reference to particulars occurs by using expressions that
are associated with sortal universals.</p>

<p>
Strawson thus emphasizes two characteristics. Sortals</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="sortal1">(1)</dt>
<dd>give a criterion for counting the items of that kind</dd>
<dt id="sortal2">(2)</dt>
<dd>give a criterion of identity and non-identity among items of that
kind.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is not difficult to see why someone would identify these
requirements. In order to know that there are exactly two <i>G</i>s in
a region <i>S</i>, it is necessary and sufficient to know that</p>

<p class="indent">
There is an <i>x</i> which is in <i>S</i> and has <i>G</i>, a <i>y</i>
which is in <i>S</i> and has <i>G</i> and is not identical to
<i>x</i>, and for any <i>z</i>, if <i>z</i> is a <i>G</i> which is in
<i>S</i> then <i>z</i> is identical with either <i>x</i> or
<i>y</i>.</p>

<p>
The phrase &ldquo;criterion of identity&rdquo; seems to mean a
criterion which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for
identity. In many cases, however, a weaker condition suffices for
counting. To conclude that there are exactly two <i>G</i>s in region
<i>S</i>, all that is required is a sufficient condition for <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> to be distinct, and a sufficient condition for <i>z</i>
to be identical with <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>. In the case of physical
objects, it may be that being at the same location at the same time is
sufficient for identity, and being in entirely separate locations at
the same time is sufficient for distinctness. In most circumstances,
these will suffice to count <i>G</i>s, but it is far short of
providing answers about partially overlapping <i>G</i>s, and provides
no guidance about identity across time. So often we may be able to
count <i>G</i>s without having a criterion of identity in the strong
sense.</p>

<p>
One of the unclarities of the phrase &ldquo;criterion of
identity&rdquo; is that it is never spelled out what the criterion is
to be applied to. For example, is it a criterion to be applied to
names of objects or to perceptual representations of objects or to the
objects themselves? It is also unclear how strictly we are to
understand &ldquo;criterion&rdquo;. In &ldquo;Entity and
identity&rdquo; (published in 1976 and reprinted in Strawson 1997b)
Strawson proposed being quite strict, limiting the phrase
&ldquo;criterion of identity&rdquo; to cases where there either is an
explicitly statable necessary and sufficient condition that does not
use the identity relation, or one where the identity relation is only
applied to constituent parts of the objects. This can be done for
numbers and sets, but probably not for any kind of concrete objects.
In 1997, he retracted that proposal in favor of the looser (and still
undefined) general philosophical use of the term (1997a: 2&ndash;3).
In contrast, Wiggins understands the counting criterion very strictly
so one instance where there is not a determinate answer to a question
leads him to reject the counting criterion (2001: 75).</p>

<p>
At the other end of the spectrum, Griffin (1997) only requires
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A term &ldquo;<i>A</i>&rdquo; is a sortal iff there can be cases in
which &ldquo;<i>A</i>&rdquo; provides, without further conceptual
decision, and without borrowing other principles of individuation,
principles adequate for counting <i>A</i>s. (1997: 43)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since most philosophers who invoke the distinction want to reject
&ldquo;thing&rdquo;, &ldquo;object&rdquo; and &ldquo;entity&rdquo; as
non-sortals, Griffin&rsquo;s suggestion is inadequate or, at least, is
a shift to a different concept with the same label. The question
&ldquo;How many things/objects/entity are in the space
<i>S</i>?&rdquo;, where <i>S</i> is an empty space has the determinate
answer &ldquo;zero&rdquo;, so all of these terms pass the Griffin
standard. One could attempt to amend the criterion by requiring that
there can be cases which satisfy the above criteria and where there is
at least one <i>A</i>. However, this fails to delineate the right
cases, because there are sortals such as &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; and
&ldquo;square circle&rdquo; which have no instances. These points, and
the observation that some of the various notions of sortal diverge,
were first made in Feldman (1973) but have not been widely noted (see
the entry on
 <a href="../identity-relative/">relative identity</a>).
 We will revisit some of these issues in
 <a href="#ConPhyObj">&sect;10.1</a>
 on the concept of physical object. </p>

<h2 id="ConProSor">5. The content provided by sortals </h2>

<p>
As illustrated above, the history of the sortal concept shows that
there is no singular, universally accepted interpretation of its
meaning. Moreover, as it will be discussed next, the criteria that
sortals are believed to convey can be understood in various ways,
further contributing to the uncertainty surrounding its content.</p>

<h3 id="Cou">5.1 Counting </h3>

<p>
As we have observed, sortals are widely regarded as a conceptual
foundation for counting. Therefore, one key criterion for determining
whether a given predicate is a sortal is whether is makes sense to ask
a meaningful &ldquo;how-many&rdquo; question about it. The requirement
for the question to be meaningful should be understood not just
grammatically, but also in a subjunctively operative sense. That is,
meaningfully asking such a question means that counting the entities
to which the predicate applies is, subjunctively speaking, a feasible
task: a task that one could complete if there were no material or time
constraints. This does not mean that carrying out the task should be
presumed to be computationally effective. Thus, the counting criterion
conveyed by a sortal is not necessarily an algorithm. (For various
interpretations of the counting criterion, see Wallace 1965 and
Griffin 1977.)</p>

<p>
If counting were the only criterion for defining sortals, many of the
so-called counting nouns would have to be classified as sortals.
However, as noted earlier, nouns like &ldquo;object&rdquo; and
&ldquo;thing&rdquo; would not meet this criterion unless we accept
that the answers to the &ldquo;how-many&rdquo; question in these cases
could be either an infinite or, as noted earlier, zero number of
objects (things). Even with this possibility in mind, scholars, such
as Ayers(1977) and Wiggins (1977), continue to argue against
classifying these and similar concepts as sortals. Therefore, the
counting criterion is not universally accepted as the definitive
characteristic of sortals, and additional criteria are needed.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, as mentioned earlier, while the counting criterion
is one of the most commonly recognized features of sortals, it relies
on other criteria that have been suggested as potential defining
factors for a predicate to be considered a sortal, such as those of
individuation and identity. Therefore, we must consider additional
criteria. </p>

<h3 id="IndEssSorWhaItQue">5.2 Individuation, essential sortals, and the &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; question </h3>

<p>
An important idea in several philosophical theories is that sortals
provide a criterion of individuation. The nature of the criterion is
not always clear, though, because the concept of individuation can be
interpreted differently. Sometimes it refers to the process by which
something becomes or is made into an individual, while at other times,
it designates the characteristic of being an individual. In the latter
sense, individuation is known as individuality (see Gracia 1988).</p>

<p>
In light of the above, we can distinguish between a cognitive and a
metaphysical sense of individuation (see Lowe 2003 and 2007). The
cognitive sense refers to the process of singling out an entity as an
individual in thought, perception, or linguistic reference. In the
metaphysical sense, individuation is a relationship of ontological
determination between entities. In this case, entities are assumed to
metaphysically explain the individual character of other entities and
condition their individuality. For example, in the case of sets, their
members determine their individuality&mdash;that is, their individual
character. </p>

<p>
It is important to note that there is no one-to-one correspondence
between the cognitive and metaphysical senses of individuation. For
instance, sortals like &ldquo;architect&rdquo;,
&ldquo;blacksmith&rdquo;, and &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; provide cognitive
criteria of individuation but not necessarily for individuality.
However, some sortals, such as those for natural kinds, may serve both
purposes.</p>

<p>
Individuation in the cognitive sense is involved in the counting and
identity criteria. For example, to ask how many horses there are in
the barn, one must be able to single out the horses in thought,
perception, or language. Similarly, asking whether John is the same
person as Peter presupposes a cognitive act of singling out.</p>

<p>
Whether individuation suffices for counting is controversial. For
instance, Wiggins in his later writings gives examples to show that
criteria of individuation are insufficient to count objects under a
sortal:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;the concept crown gives a satisfactory way of answering
identity-questions for crowns. But there is no universally applicable
definite way of counting crowns. The Pope&rsquo;s crown is made of
crowns. There is no definite answer, when the Pope is wearing his
crown, to the question &ldquo;how many crowns does he have on his
head&rdquo; (1980: 73; 2001: 75)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a footnote to the same pages, Wiggins gives a list of other
examples of terms which permit individuation but not counting:
&ldquo;wave, volume of fluid, worm, garden, crystal, piece of string,
word-token, machine&rdquo;. Wiggins continues by explaining that, on
his view, his account does not disagree with Strawson&rsquo;s but
corrects and enlarges it (2001: 75). We find it puzzling that Wiggins
dismisses &ldquo;animal&rdquo; as a sortal but is willing to include
&ldquo;machine&rdquo; which seems at least as problematic. According
to Wiggins, only those concepts that possess clear criteria of
individuation count as sortals, and he maintains that
&ldquo;animal&rdquo; lack such a definite criteria. In his view,
although the term &ldquo;animal&rdquo; can readily acquire
individuative force from contextual factors or the presence of
another, more specific sortal predicate, it does not, in and of
itself, establish a single principle of individuation.</p>

<p>
We should point out that, corresponding to the two senses of
individuation discussed above, there are two philosophical theories in
which sortals play a crucial role: perception sortalism and
metaphysical sortalism. The first theory, perception sortalism, holds
that sortals are essential for perception, as they are thought to be
the means by which objects are identified (see Campbell 2002 and
Clarke 2006). In contrast, metaphysical sortalism asserts that
individuals are individuated by their essences or as being of a
particular kind. These essences or kinds are considered real entities,
which are expressed or captured by sortal predicates (see Lowe 2009
for natural kinds, and Heil 2003 for artifacts). Subsequently, in
 <a href="#Sor">&sect;10.3</a>,
 both philosophical theories will be revisited and examined once
more.</p>

<p>
Sortals that convey essences are referred to as essential sortals.
Some argue that, in general, sortal specify the essences of the things
they categorize. However, this is a controversial position. There is
significant debate about whether the entire concept of essence is
coherent, which leads to disagreements about the existence of
essential sortals. For instance, Brody (1980) and Wiggins (2001)
defend the idea of essential sortals, while Mackie (2006) argues
against it. Moreover, even among those who accept the existence of
essential sortals, there is disagreement about whether they operate at
a general level, such as &ldquo;animal&rdquo; or, at a more specific
level, such as &ldquo;dog&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Even assuming that there are essences, no consensus exists on whether
kinds have essences. For instance, Quine would argue that they do not.
Additionally, among those who assert the existence of essences, there
is no agreement on what those essences are. Contemporary versions of
sortal essentialism attempt to address those issues, particularly the
theories put forward by Brody (1980) and Wiggins (1967, 1980, and
2001) mentioned earlier. Another influential approach is offered by
the essentialism of origin, proposed by authors like Forbes (1985) and
Salmon (1981) (for a discussion of these theories, see Robertson
(1998, 2000)). Minimalist essentialism (Mackie 2006) is an alternative
to those two forms of essentialism.</p>

<p>
In addition to the idea that sortals stand for essences, there is the
broader view that they answer the &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;question.
Unless the question is given a more specific technical sense, it seems
that sortals in the broad Strawsonian sense&mdash; such as a &ldquo;A
kitten&rdquo; or &ldquo;A red table&rdquo;&mdash; answer the question
adequately. The kitten does not go out of existence when it becomes
adult, but it is no longer a kitten. This approach could encompass the
essentialist perspective as well.</p>

<h3 id="IdeCriIdeSor">5.3 Identity, criterion of identity, and sortals </h3>

<p>
As we have indicated, the idea of a sortal has been closely linked to
the notion of identity and its related notion of a criterion of
identity. Over time, different perspectives on such notions have
emerged, adding another layer of variation to understanding what the
nature of a sortal entails. To clarify this aspect, we will now focus
specifically on the notions in question in their connection to
sortals.</p>

<h3 id="IdeIndCriIde">5.4 Identity, indiscernibility, and the criterion of identity </h3>

<p>
It is a law in many logical systems that things that are identical
share all of their properties. This is known as the law of the
<em>Indiscernibility of Identicals</em>. The controversial converse,
known as <em>the Identity of Indiscernibles</em>, says that things
that share all of their properties are identical. If
&ldquo;property&rdquo; is understood sufficiently liberally, then the
latter principle is certainly true&mdash;any object \(b\) has the
property of &ldquo;being identical to \(b\)&rdquo;, and if \(c\) also
has that property, then \(b = c\). The question is whether the
principle holds with any more restricted sense of property. Ladyman et
al.(2012) discuss and relate different interpretations of
indiscernibility associated with various senses of properties. Many of
these interpretations would ground different versions of the identity
of indiscernibles principle. (See the entry on
 <a href="../identity-indiscernible/">this principle</a>
 for philosophical perspectives other than those considered by Ladyman
et al. (2012).) </p>

<p>
One might closely link indiscernibility to the notion of a criterion
of identity (together with its connection to sortals) when
&ldquo;criterion of identity&rdquo; is understood as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
For any sortal \(F\) there is a set of properties \(\phi\) such that
if \(b\) and \(c\) both are \(F\), then if \(b\) and \(c\) instantiate
exactly the same properties in \(\phi\) then \(b = c\).</p>

<p>
Some attempts to give content to the phrase &ldquo;criterion of
identity&rdquo; can be understood in this framework. Black (1952)
argues that purely internal properties of objects do not suffice; his
example is a universe with two spheres which share all of their
internal properties, i.e., are the same color, weight, composition,
etc. </p>

<p>
There are a wide range of philosophical views about criteria of
identity. Brody (1980) takes the two identity and indiscernibility
principles as jointly <em>definitive</em> of identity and consequently
argues that no further criteria of identity are required. Baker (1997)
argues that there are no criteria of identity across time, while
Jubien (1996), Merricks (1998) and Zimmerman (1998) articulate reasons
to doubt that there are any criteria of identity. Lowe (1989,1997, and
2009) are more recent attempts to clarify the concept</p>

<p>
Finally, there are well-known historical debates about identity that
lead to disagreements regarding the relationship between essential
sortals and identity. Some philosophers argue that there is a unique,
universal identity relation that holds (or does not) independently of
any sortals. In contrast, others maintain that identity is always
relative to a sortal. For example, we may have a statue of Lincoln and
a statue of Caesar, which are considered distinct statues, even though
they are both made of the same lump of bronze. In this case, the
sortals &ldquo;statue&rdquo; and &ldquo;lump of bronze&rdquo; provide
different answers to the identity question. These examples underscore
the necessity of now considering notions of identity as
sortal-relative.</p>

<h3 id="IdeStrSorRel">5.5 Is identity strongly sortal relative?</h3>

<p>
One of the novel claims in Geach&rsquo;s <em>Reference and
Generality</em> was that identity is relative in the strong sense that
for two sortal expressions <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, <i>b</i> and
<i>c</i> might be the same <i>F</i>, but not the same <i>G</i>. Geach
used the expression &ldquo;substantival&rdquo; to characterize the
kinds of term <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> are. His
&ldquo;substantival&rdquo; coincides in many cases with sortals as
understood by others, but cannot be entirely the same since he cites
&ldquo;gold&rdquo; as an example of a substantival, in fact:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we can speak of the same gold as being first a statue and then a great
number of coins, but &ldquo;How many golds?&rdquo; does not make
sense. Thus &ldquo;gold&rdquo; is a substantival term, though we
cannot use it for counting. (1962: 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the examples he gives is that <i>b</i> might be the same river
as <i>c</i>, but not the same water. Or, if some bronze is made into
first one statue, then a different one, then the two statues are not
the same statue but are the same bronze.</p>

<p>
Quine (1964) and others were critical of Geach&rsquo;s solution to
these puzzles and defended the view that there is only one unqualified
sense of identity. In each of the problem cases, his strategy was to
try to show that one of the statements of the form &ldquo;same
<i>G</i> as&rdquo; is not a true identity statement. So in the river
example, Quine would deny that the water is identical to the river and
thus the two statements are about different objects. Almost all of
Geach&rsquo;s examples can with some plausibility be treated by
distinguishing more carefully between objects of reference or
distinguishing constitution from identity. Thus, one might say that
the bronze at different times constitutes the two statues but is not
identical with them. Whether constitution really is or isn&rsquo;t
identity is a matter of continuing debate; for articulations of the
two sides see Johnston (1992), Noonan (1993), Baker (2007, chap.3),
and the entry on
 <a href="../material-constitution/">material constitution</a>.
 For later stages in the debate between Quine and Geach, see the entry
on
 <a href="../identity/">identity</a>
 .</p>

<p>
Sometimes it appears that identity is relative, when in fact ambiguity
of reference is present. We might say that George and I took the same
bus, meaning that we both took a bus on route #56. Or you might say of
the same events that we took different buses, because I took the #56
at 10:25 and George took one at 12:30. But these are not conflicting
identity statements about the same things. The first concerns sameness
of bus routes, while the second concerns time specific instances of
the route. </p>

<p>
One example that does not readily lend itself to these approaches is
the problem of the Christian Trinity. According to this doctrine, God
the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three persons but one God
or one substance. Thus, they provide an alleged example where <i>b</i>
and <i>c</i> are distinct persons but the same substance. We will not
enter the debate, which is been conducted for over a millennium, as to
whether this doctrine is coherent, but refer the reader to a modern
discussion in Cartwright 1987. It is certainly accurate to say that
all of Geach&rsquo;s examples are contested. For details on how the
problematic character of such examples can be systematically
dispelled, see, for instance, Wiggins (2001, chap. 2).</p>

<h3 id="IdeWeaSorRel">5.6 Is identity weakly sortal relative?</h3>

<p>
Wiggins and others argue that identity is dependent on a sortal in a
weaker sense. The criterion for the identity of sets is perhaps the
one clear and uncontroversial case: Two sets are identical, the same
set, if and only if they have the same members. (Notice that while the
criterion is clear, the appeal to identity reappears with reference to
the members.) While it is perhaps less uncontroversial, my car is the
same as the car I owned five years ago even though the oil, tires,
battery and have been replaced; the car can remain the same even
though some parts change. My friend is the same person as he was five
years ago in spite of many natural changes in the molecules composing
his body, some dental fillings, an artificial hip and a new cornea
lens. Two natural numbers are the same if they gave the same
successor, and two real numbers are identical iff they bear all of the
same order relations to the other numbers, =3.14&hellip;. Notice that
in all of these cases appeal to identity recurs with reference to
parts (whether body or automotive) or relations to other objects of
the same category. </p>

<p>
The weak sortal relativity claim consists of saying that the identity
relation for sets is different from those for numbers, which is
different from those for people and artifacts like cars, and numbers.
For sets it involves members of whatever kind, for numbers relations
to numbers and for persons and artifacts continuity of life and of
function. For abstract non-mathematical things, the relation is even
less clear&mdash;the question when two ideas are the same idea is
often only settled in a court case about copyright or patent
infringement. </p>

<p>
In other words, there are two conceptions of identity: On one the
general identity relation is pieced together from the different
identity relations for different categories of things. For <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i> to be identical is for them to be the same person or the
same number or the same artifact or &hellip;. On the other conception,
there is a general notion of identity, perhaps given by the identity
laws discussed in
 <a href="#IdeIndCriIde"> Section 5.4</a>
 , and the specific ones are ways of instantiating that relation. The
best argument for the first view is that the pieces seem too diverse
to be parts of the same general relation. The best argument for the
second is that as we move from domain to domain, and even invent new
ones, the general identity scheme guides our development of an
understanding of the more local notion. (For a detailed analysis of
Wiggins&rsquo; claims see Snowdon 2009.)</p>

<h2 id="SorMasCouDis">6. Sortals and the mass-count distinction </h2>

<p>
Linguists have long distinguished between mass and count nouns based
on grammatical factors. Mass nouns include terms for materials like
water, gold, iron, and meat. However, like sortals, mass terms convey
identity criteria and can appear in relative identity statements. For
instance, one might say c is the same gold as b, referring to a gold
bucket (c) that was melted to form a gold bracelet (b). </p>

<p>
The fact that mass terms can convey identity criteria has led some
philosophers to group them with sortals (e.g. Lowe 2009). Others argue
that mass terms should be treated within the sortal vs. non-sortal
distinction. A key reason for this is grammatical. Count nouns form
plurals and appear in constructions like &ldquo;How many
&hellip;&rdquo;. Mass nouns, on the other hand, do not pluralize and
typically occur in constructions such as &ldquo;How much
&hellip;?&rdquo;. For example, we ask how many cats someone owns, but
how much cat food they have. Some words have both a mass and a count
sense, such as &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;. We can ask both how many
chickens someone owns and how much chicken they want for dinner. (For
more in-depth discussions on the mass-count distinction, from
philosophical, linguistic, and cognitive perspectives, see Pelletier
(1979, 2010), as well as the entries on
 <a href="../logic-massexpress/">the logic</a>
 and
 <a href="../metaphysics-massexpress/">the metaphysics of mass expressions</a>,
 .)</p>

<p>
The grammatical distinction is robust; nearly all speakers of a
language agree on which sentences are grammatical and which are not.
However, philosophers continue to debate how closely count nouns align
with sortals. For example, while the sentences &ldquo;There are three
red things on the shelf&rdquo; and &ldquo;Two objects collided&rdquo;
are grammatical correct and so &ldquo;red thing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;object&rdquo; are count nouns, many philosophers contend that
they are not sortals, as previously noted. Hirsch (1977) and Wiggins
(1977), for instance, claim that you cannot count red things or
objects, even though the request to do so is grammatical. Others think
that we can count red things, but the only correct answers are
&ldquo;infinitely many&rdquo; and &ldquo;none&rdquo;- if there are no
red objects, there are none, but if some red thing is present, its top
half, bottom half, and various of its parts can be counted as separate
red things, such as the three thirds or eight eights of the object,
leading to an infinite number of red things. This view is contested,
and the debate resurfaces later when we discuss, in
 <a href="#SorTheRolCog"> Section 10</a>,
 the role of sortals in cognition.</p>

<p>
The philosophical distinction between &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; and
&ldquo;things&rdquo; might also be instrumental in the above debate.
Some stuff composes things&mdash;such as wood constituting a ship. The
count-mass distinction often aligns with this difference but not
always. For example, while &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; and
&ldquo;vegetable&rdquo; are count nouns, &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; and
&ldquo;furniture&rdquo; are mass nouns, even though the specific items
they refer to-for instance, apples and chairs-are countable.
Additionally, different languages treat these concepts differently
&mdash;In English, vegetables are counted, while in German, speakers
ask how much <em>Gemuse</em> you want, even though
&ldquo;<em>Gemuse</em>&rdquo; refers to the same things as
&ldquo;vegetable&rdquo;. In Italian both &ldquo;<em>frutta</em>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<em>verdura</em>&rdquo; are mass nouns.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is the distinction between counting and measuring.
While the differences between counting&mdash;how many oranges do we
have&mdash;and measuring&mdash;how much rice do we have&mdash;are
clear, other cases are perplexing. Salmon (1997) offers multiple
possible analyses of sentences such as &ldquo;There are two and a half
oranges on the table&rdquo;, but he finds all of them wanting. </p>

<h2 id="PerCriSubSor">7. The persistence criterion and substance sortals</h2>

<p>
Questions of identity over time are difficult because they involve
issues of persistence. For example, when a kitten grows up, it ceases
to be a kitten but is still the same cat and the same animal. In
contrast, if we tear down a garage and build a treehouse from the same
materials, it is no longer the same building. If a car is crushed into
a metal cube, it no longer exists as a car, but if the car is
transformed into a boat, does one thing exist as a car and then as a
boat? Some views suggest that when a person dies, they cease to exist,
while others propose that the same person may be reincarnated in a new
form. Similarly, is a werewolf sometimes a person and sometimes a
wolf, or are they always a werewolf, neither a person nor a wolf?</p>

<p>
In general, when does something survive change, and when it does not?
Which kinds of change allows for continued existence? Sortals, which
provide criteria for persistence through time are often referred as
substance sortals. By their characteristics, essential sortals will
qualify as substance sortals, but the reverse is not necessarily true.
Similarly to the case of essential sortals, there are systematic
disagreements among philosophers whether the substance sortals are to
be located at a relatively specific level, e.g., &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and
&ldquo;river&rdquo;, or at the level of a more general category, e.g.,
&ldquo;animal&rdquo;and &ldquo;geographic feature&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The sortals that Wiggins regards as crucial, the substance sortals,
are a proper subset of the ones Strawson is concerned with.
<em>Substance</em> sortals contrast with <em>phase</em> sortals; the
latter typically only apply to some temporal segment of an object.
Kitten is a phase sortal because when a cat matures it ceases to be a
kitten but it does not go out of existence. Substance sortals are also
contrasted with restricted sortals, e.g., &ldquo;red table&rdquo;.
Wiggins has a detailed theory of the structure of substance sortals,
arguing that if any two substance sortals overlap, then either one is
a restriction of the other or both are restrictions of some other
sortal.</p>

<p>
This seems problematic because it is plausible that plant and animal
are both substance sortals. While they do not overlap, another
candidate for being a substance sortal <em>carnivore</em> overlaps
both. This would probably not disturb Wiggins, since he already denies
that &ldquo;animal&rdquo; is a substance sortal:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not to be denied that the words &ldquo;this animal&rdquo;
suffice to express a rough and ready identification in ordinary
contexts of what things are. But this is because &ldquo;animal&rdquo;
so easily takes on an individuative force from a context and/or some
other sortal predicate that is ready to hand. But the designation
&ldquo;this animal&rdquo; is complemented in all sorts of
<em>different</em> ways. In itself it determines no single principle
of individuation. (2001: 129)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We said earlier that in contrast with Strawson, Wiggins is concerned
primarily with the narrower class of substance sortals. Yet if we read
his account carefully, it emerges that in the end individuation rests
with an even smaller class which he calls
&ldquo;<em>ultimate</em>&rdquo; sortals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By an ultimate sortal I mean a sortal which either itself restricts no
other sortal or else has a sense which both yields necessary and
sufficient conditions of persistence for the kind it defines and is
such that this sense can be clearly fixed and fully explained without
reference to any other sortal which restricts it. (1967: 32)</p>

<p>
&hellip;I shall call <em>x&rsquo;</em>s ultimate sortal concept
&hellip; the sortal concept which is individuative of <i>x</i> and
restricts no other sortal concept. (1980: 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea is that &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and &ldquo;dog&rdquo; may both be
individuated by the same criterion, so the fundamental criterion is
not only associated with them but with other substance sortals that
fall under the same ultimate sortal. We know from Wiggins&rsquo;s
remarks that &ldquo;animal&rdquo; is not a sortal, so the ultimate
sortal for &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and &ldquo;dog&rdquo; is somewhere in the
hierarchy above those concepts but below &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.
Surprisingly, given the centrality of this notion, Wiggins nowhere
gives an example of what he regards as an ultimate sortal. (At 1980:
123 he does speculate inconclusively that &ldquo;man&rdquo; might be
the ultimate sortal for Julius Caesar.)</p>

<p>
Without more specificity about when principles of individuation are
the same and different, the foundation of Wiggins&rsquo;s account is
murky. For example, we don&rsquo;t have enough information to
determine whether some middle level term such as &ldquo;mammal&rdquo;
is an ultimate sortal or not.</p>

<p>
There are also other problems. Wiggins recognizes that his account of
individuation of biological kinds in terms of &ldquo;characteristic
forms of activity&rdquo; does not transfer well to prototypical
artifacts. He tries to meet this concern by giving an analysis in
terms of function for artifacts such as clocks. However, he seems to
assume that there are not problematic intermediate cases between
natural kinds and pure artifacts. Many kinds of things, e.g., rivers
and lakes, can be either natural or artificial. They can also be
partly artificial, as when a river is dredged or a lake enlarged.
Nevertheless, Wiggins (2016, chap. 16, sec. 16&ndash;17, and chap. 12)
might provide criteria for deciding upon these cases. (See Carrara
&amp; Vermass (2009), Baker (2004, 2008), and Losonsky (1990), for
critical discussions on Wiggins&rsquo; view on artifacts; see also the
entry on
 <a href="../artifact/">artifacts</a>
 for more general discussions of this notion in diverse areas of
philosophy.)</p>

<p>
Moreover, in his own favorite cases of biology, he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Almost everything that has been said so far has been mainly directed
at words standing for the various species of natural substances. The
account could be extended and adapted without overwhelming difficulty
to predicates of genera, wherever these were still determinate enough
to be autonomously individuative. (2001: 86)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, his own favorite examples, &ldquo;elm&rdquo; borrowed
from Putnam (1975) and &ldquo;frog&rdquo; are not terms for species.
&ldquo;Elm&rdquo; is a genus and &ldquo;frog&rdquo; an order. In fact,
a quick consultation with a good dictionary will reveal that most
commonly used biological terms are expressions for some classification
above the level of species. Since Wiggins is cautious about extending
his account to genera, he may have very few substance sortals by his
account.</p>

<p>
Another issue with using species as the model of sortals is that
contemporary philosophers of biology generally agree that species
don&rsquo;t have essences, though there is disagreement among them
about the best way to characterize species (for details, see the entry
on
 <a href="../species/">species</a>).
 However, Wiggins defends a different version of
essentialism&mdash;namely, individual essentialism. This is the view
that an individual is essentially a member of the species it belongs
to (Wiggins 2001, chap. 4), and it is logically independent of species
essentialism. For example, a given whale, is essentially a member of
the species whales, even if the species itself possesses no essential
property. Therefore, rejecting species essentialism does not
necessarily entail rejecting individual essentialism. Moreover, there
are attempts by Wiggins to argue that species don&rsquo;t have
essences. He states, for example, that <em>species</em> is an:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;insecure concept in plant-taxonomy, and threatened even in
zoology by such phenomena as ring-species and the imperfect
transitivity of the relation interbreeds in the wild with&mdash;the
operational test of identity of species. (1967: 62)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is no incoherence here on Wiggins&rsquo; part because, as
pointed out above, species essentialism is logically independent of
individual essentialism. Nevertheless, Wiggins&rsquo; essentialism is,
like species essentialism, also subject to criticism based on
contemporary results from the philosophy of biology (Laporte 1997 and
Okasha 2000). But see Ferner (2016) for a sympathetic discussion of
Wiggins&rsquo; doctrines from the perspective of biology, and Devitt
(2018) for a recent defense of individual essentialism, which
considers the views and criticism in question.</p>

<h2 id="SorForAbsObj">8. Sortals for abstract objects</h2>

<p>
Most discussions of sortals focus on kinds of physical objects, but by
the definitions given many sortals also apply to abstract objects. And
in some of these cases the question what a criterion of identity is
becomes even more difficult. We can ask how many new ideas a political
candidate has, how many governments Italy has had since 1950 and how
many books David Wiggins has written. Ideas, governments and books (in
the sense of type of book, not specific copies) are all abstract
objects. We comment on changes in corporations over time&mdash;Apple
has grown&mdash;which implies identifying Apple over time in spite of
changes. But we are far short of having criteria to make decisions in
harder cases: Did Rice Institute cease to exist in 1960 or was it just
transformed with a new name and some changes in charter to Rice
University. The buildings, faculty and students all persisted, but did
the educational institution?</p>

<p>
The question can perhaps be made more pointed if we consider sortals
for collections that do not imply complex structure. Corporations are
complex, as are educational institutions. In contrast, a flock of
birds does not entail a great deal of complexity, just enough birds in
one location. We can sometimes definitively say that two flocks are
the same: if exactly the same birds flew over the lake this morning as
did yesterday then the two flocks are in fact one. And if none of the
birds that flew over the lake yesterday were in today&rsquo;s flock,
then they are definitively different. But suppose most but not all
were the same birds?</p>

<p>
Mathematics also presents issues about what counts as a criterion,
even when the definition is quite precise. Two irrational numbers
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are identical if they have exactly the same
relations to each of the rational numbers. Pi is identical with
3.14&hellip; because Pi is greater than 3, 3.1, 3.14, etc. and less
than 4, 3.2, 3.15, etc. But does this count as a criterion? It appeals
to the less than relation, which is a close cousin to identity itself
and it involves relations to similar entities. </p>

<p>
Yet another issue involves possible identification between different
kinds of numbers. There is a natural number 2, a positive integer +2,
a rational number 2/1, a real number 2.0000&hellip; Are these the same
number? Different understandings of number and different philosophies
of mathematics offer differing answers. But these controversies seem
insufficient reason to deny &ldquo;number&rdquo; the status of a
sortal.</p>

<h2 id="SorTerDivTheRef">9. Sortals as terms that divide their references</h2>

<p>
W.V. Quine (1960) introduced the characterization of sortals as terms
that divide their references. Clearly, this characterization differs
from that of Strawson, Wiggins and Geach, although in footnote 1 of
Quine 1960: 90 he says that his expression is equivalent to
Strawson&rsquo;s &ldquo;sortal&rdquo;. Unfortunately, that cannot be
exactly true since 1960: 91 Quine says that &ldquo;object&rdquo;
divides its reference, though we have seen &ldquo;object&rdquo; is not
a sortal by the criteria of Strawson or Wiggins because it does not
enable counting. We should note that in other of his writings (1969,
1981) he also used the expression &ldquo;individuative word&rdquo; as
an alternative to the expression &ldquo;term that divide&rdquo;. </p>

<p>
Quine does not give an explicit criterion for determining when a term
&ldquo;divides its reference&rdquo;, but some have been proposed on
his behalf. Wallace (1965) discusses two understandings of the term.
The first is</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>G</i> divides its reference iff it is never the case that if
<i>a</i> is <i>G</i>, <i>a</i> can be divided into two parts which are
<i>G</i></p>

<p>
While this characterizes &ldquo;cat&rdquo; as a sortal and
&ldquo;object&rdquo; as a non-sortal, it also excludes some terms that
are sortals by the counting criteria, e.g., garden hoses, rocks, piles
of snow, sand dunes, amoeba and ice cubes. He also discusses the
converse: <i>G</i> divides its reference just in case whenever
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are <i>G</i>, the result of putting <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> together is never <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>
This will get the easy cases right, as above, but also fails on the
same problematic list. (Most of these points were made in Feldman 1973
where he also explores various other ways of modifying these
principles.)</p>

<p>
The closest Quine comes to an explicit formulation of a
characterization is in contrasting individuative terms with mass
terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
So-called <em>mass</em> terms like &ldquo;water&rdquo;,
&ldquo;footwear&rdquo; and &ldquo;red&rdquo; have the semantical
property of referring cumulatively: any sum of parts which are water
is water. (1960: 91)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By &ldquo;sum&rdquo; here he almost certainly means the mereological
sum, not the result of physical juxtaposition. This would mean that
&ldquo;object&rdquo; and &ldquo;space time region&rdquo; would not be
sortals, but &ldquo;spatio-temporally continuous object&rdquo; and
&ldquo;space-time region with volume less than <i>x</i>&rdquo; are
sortals. These results may be consistent with Quine&rsquo;s views
given that he has indicated that he accepts &ldquo;object&rdquo;, but
they diverge from the Strawson-Wiggins intent. Note that the three
terms listed above have some significant differences;
&ldquo;water&rdquo; refers to a kind of stuff, &ldquo;footwear&rdquo;
to a kind of thing, and &ldquo;red&rdquo; is a property of both stuff
and things. (See Laycock 2011 and the entry on
 <a href="../object/">object</a>
 for further discussion.)</p>

<p>
In any event, Quine&rsquo;s view of the distinction is much more
pragmatic than most. In explaining the distinction, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The contrast lies in the terms and not in the stuff they name.
&hellip;consider &ldquo;shoe&rdquo;, &ldquo;pair of shoes&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;footwear&rdquo;: all three range over exactly the same stuff,
and differ from one another solely in that two of them divide their
reference differently and the third not at all. (1960: 91)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even this characterization of a contrast is dubious if we note that by
the last criterion &ldquo;object with mass more than 2 kg&rdquo; is
not an individuative term since the sum of any two such objects is
another such object, whereas &ldquo;object with mass less than 2
kg&rdquo; fails the test since the sum of two such objects sometimes
has mass over 2 kg. It is difficult to see any important respect in
which the two expressions divide their reference differently. Object
more than 2 kg and object less than 2 kg seem to divide their
reference.</p>

<p>
Another example, given by Feldman (1973), can be used to illustrate
the somewhat capricious nature of the distinction and its language
dependence. He claims that &ldquo;five-foot garden hose&rdquo; is an
individuative term since no part of it is a five-foot garden hose, but
&ldquo;garden hose&rdquo; is not individuative. The latter claim
requires some qualification. If being a garden hose requires a
coupling on one end and a nozzle on the other, then the halves of a
garden hose are not garden hoses. If being a garden hose requires
neither a nozzle nor coupling, then each half (indeed each
<i>n</i><sup>th</sup>, up to some <i>n</i>) of a garden hose is a
garden hose. If being a garden hose requires a coupling but not a
nozzle, then one half of a garden hose is a garden hose but the other
is not. Although the differences may be important to the gardener, it
is difficult to see anything metaphysically deep here.</p>

<h2 id="SorTheRolCog">10. Sortals and their role in cognition</h2>

<p>
The concept of a sortal has made its way into the philosophy of
cognition and psychology, particularly cognitive developmental
psychology. Among others, sortal-related issues in these fields
include how sortals contribute to cognitive development, specifically
in humans (though also in non-human primates), their role in
perception, and their connection to language, object-based attention,
and the elements and structure of the (human) mind in its cognitive
function.</p>

<h3 id="ConPhyObj">10.1 The concept of physical object </h3>

<p>
A central issue in development psychology involves understanding when
and how individuals develop the ability to recognize, identify and
determine the persistence of objects over time and space. Some argue
that the concept of a physical object plays a crucial role in this
ability, serving as foundation for forming sortal concepts.</p>

<p>
Ayers (1974), for instance, argued that the concept of a physical
object is crucial for human cognition and its construction, as it
provides criteria for counting and persistence. According to him, a
physical object is a discrete entity, a natural unit or structure that
exists, continues to exist, and ceases to exist independently of our
conceptualization. Its unity is defined by causality. Moreover, a
physically object is not simply matter filling a continuous space-time
region; it exists as a maximal entity. This means that we typically do
not regard any proper part of a physical object as an object on its
own. This characteristic allows us to identify, count, and track the
persistence of object over time and space.</p>

<p>
Despite the above, Ayers does not regard the concept of a physical
object as a sortal concept. He argues that a sortal concept must
provide the essential features that define an object. While the
concept of a physical object enables individuation and identification,
it does not explain the unity and continuity of objects based on their
essential features. In this regard, Ayers aligns with the view of
sortals as concepts that provide the essence of the objects they apply
to.</p>

<p>
In contrast to Ayers, Xu (1997) views the concept of a physical object
as a sortal, emphasizing that it includes counting and persistence
criteria. This differentiates her perspective from Ayer&rsquo;s. She
understands the concept of a physical object as a bounded, coherent,
three-dimensional entity that moves as a whole. Because the nature of
such entities, Xu suggests that physical objects can persist through
substantial transformations, citing the Biblical example of
Lot&rsquo;s wife turning into a pillar of salt (Xu 1997), a view that
Ayers would reject. But, in an line similar to Ayers, she thinks that
the concept of physical object persists in adults&rsquo; and can be
applied to unfamiliar objects.</p>

<p>
She also argues that the concept of physical object is integral to
cognitive development and appears in infants at an early stage. Based
on her research and that of others (Xu &amp; Carey 1996,1999 Spelke
1996), she suggested that acquiring the concept of a physical object
represents a key milestone in cognitive growth, paving the way for
more sophisticated sortal concepts associated with language
development. Sarnecki (2008) concurs, proposing that a general sortal
concept is a necessary step toward acquiring language-based
sortals.</p>

<p>
In addition to the concept of physical object, Xu (2002) has suggested
that linguistic labels may influence the acquisition of sortal
concepts in infants as young as 9-months. Quine (1960) had already
highlighted this crucial role of language in developing sortal-like
predicates, proposing that the ability to distinguish the world into
objects only develops with language and the conceptual framework of
identity and quantification. However, experimental evidence from Soja
et al. (1991) challenges Quine&rsquo;s perspective. Moreover, research
results in primates, such as those presented in Phillips and Santos
(2007), and Mendes et al.(2008), provide additional empirical support
against Quine&rsquo;s claim. Nonetheless, a nuanced version of
Quine&rsquo;s view, particularly regarding quantitative distinctions,
has found empirical backing in research by Imai and Genter (1997) and
Yoshida and Smith (2003). </p>

<p>
Xu&rsquo;s interpretation of the concept of physical objected as a
sortal has faced significant criticism. Critics argue, for example,
that it excludes stationary objects, does not adequately express the
nature of objects, and it is not maximal as she intends a physical
object to be. Additionally, the experiments supporting Xu&rsquo;s
claims have been challenged. Critics have suggested that these
findings may instead reflect infants&rsquo; perceptual ability to
attend to and track objects using spatiotemporal information, even
before fully developed system of concepts is in place. For further
details on these critiques, see Ayers (1977), Casati (2004), Hirsch
(1977), Rips and Leonard (2019), and Wiggins (1977). It is important
to note that these different papers reveal the discrepancy that
pervades the several interpretations of the nature of a sortal.</p>

<p>
Finally, given the importance of object knowledge in navigating the
environment, it is plausible that other species share some aspects of
the concept of physical object. There is some preliminary evidence of
this in primates, and recent findings suggest that young chickens may
also possess such a concept (Fontanari et al.2014).</p>

<h3 id="EssCogBasLevCatSor">10.2 Essentialist cognition, basic level categorization, and sortals</h3>

<p>
Gelman (2003,2013) and others have provided evidence suggesting a mode
of cognition of an essentialist character already operative in
children. According to this view, specific categories of object and
substances &mdash; such as natural and social kinds, artifacts and
those represented by mass terms and sortals&mdash;are assumed to
possess an underlying, unobservable reality. This assumption explains
and grounds children&rsquo;s inductive inferences based on the
categories in question. It also accounts for children&rsquo;s tendency
to assign causal, non-obvious properties, and fixed, immutable
boundaries to these categories. Children view some of these properties
as innate. Research results (Caccione et al. 2016; Mendes et al.2018,
2011; and Santos et al.2002) suggest that essentialist thinking may
emerge in humans at a pre-linguistic stage, particularly through the
process of sortal object individuation. This phenomenon may also be
evident in certain primates (Phillips et al.2010). </p>

<p>
A related line of research, initiated by Rosch (1973) and Rosch et al.
(1976), suggests that there is a category of basic level objects.
While the specificity of classification can vary with context, there
is a tendency to prefer a particular in most situations. For example,
while we might generally describe something as a mammal or a poodle,
the most common and natural noun would be &ldquo;dog&rdquo;. Rosch
found considerable cross-cultural agreement on what constitutes as
basic-level objects, although some variation exists. Basic-level
categories are characterized by being the most informative, with
features such such as shape, color, form of movement providing key
information about other properties of the object. For example, a
self-moving and dog-shaped it is likely to bark, eat meat, chase cats,
<em>etcetera</em>. </p>

<p>
Although Rosch&rsquo;s basic-level categories offer useful answers to
the question &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; they do not provide the
traditional essences philosophers and psychologist often discuss.
Traditional essences are typically viewed as necessary and sufficient
conditions for being a member of that kind. From this perspective,
learning a new sortal requires knowing the defining features and how
they combine to create the kind. However, according to Rosch&rsquo;s
conception, sortal words are learned through exposure to families of
prototypes, with the primary learning experience involving
familiarization with prototypical examples of the kind. Prototypes are
the most representative examples, elicit the fastest responses when
queried, and are the most frequently cited when asked for examples of
a category. For example, in the category of birds, robins are one of
the most prototypical, swans are intermediate, and penguins are very
unprototypical. Evidence supporting Rosch&rsquo;s theory, including
the failure to produce adequate necessary and sufficient conditions
for many common sortals, as well as the positive experimental
evidence, suggest that categories function more fluidly that
traditional essence-based account. This view aligns with
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s conception of categories.</p>

<p>
In relation to the idea of essence, Markman (1989) and Markman et al.
(2003) have argued that children&rsquo;s early language learning is
guided by several principles, one of which is the mutual exclusivity
constraint. This principle suggests that when learning words, a
guiding assumption is that distinct words refer to distinct things.
While this assumption is not always true, Markman and others provide
evidence that this constraint is operative, and that in the language
learning environment of young children it is a very helpful, if
imperfect constraint. If Rosch is correct about the existence of a
preferred basic level of objects, it may be that speakers generally
use words at that level of objects and thus the exclusivity constraint
may be supported by the basic level object hypothesis. However,
experimental data on these issues appear to be conflicting (Mervis et
al. 1994). Scholl (2008) offers a useful discussion of whether and how
philosophy and psychology can interact to deepen our understanding
these issues.</p>

<h3 id="Sor">10.3 Sortalism </h3>

<p>
The idea that entities require sortals for their individuation and
identity is a broad position known as sortalism. Various forms of
sortalism have been developed from either a metaphysical or
psychological perspective, as mentioned in section
 <a href="#IndEssSorWhaItQue">5.2 </a>.
 When the focus is metaphysical, the view is referred as
<em>metaphysical sortalism</em>. In this case, sortals are the
metaphysical conditions for the identity, individuation, and essence
of entities. (For instance, see Wiggins 2001 and Loew 2009). If
sortalism is addressed from a psychological perspective, it is
referred as <em>psychosortalism</em> or <em>sortalism of
thought</em>.</p>

<p>
Psychosortalism starts with the clear idea that human perception
necessitates the individuation and differentiation of the perceived
entities. In other words, when one encounters an object in the
perceptual space&mdash;whether through sight, hearing, touch, smell,
taste or any other sense&mdash;one must identify it as an individual
and distinguish it from others in the same context in order to
perceive it. Several philosophers and psychologists claim that this
process of individuation and differentiation relies on sortal concepts
(see Mcnamara 1986; Carey and Xu 1996 and 1999; Clark 2006; and Quine
1950 and 1960). Based on this claim, a second claim is upheld: sortals
constitute the necessary elements to determine the persistence of
objects and allow us to track them across space. Both of these two
claims summarize the main tenets of psychosortalism or sortalism of
thought.</p>

<p>
While possessing sortal concepts enables effective perception (and so
are sufficient for this task), their role as necessary conditions is
contentious. Several arguments suggest that individuation and
differentiation can occur without sortal concepts, relying instead on
mechanisms that delineate and direct conscious attention to objects
based on spatiotemporal and property information. This form of
individuation is shared by animals, such as cats and dogs. (See
Campbell 2002 and 2006, Raftopolous and Muller 2006).</p>

<p>
Other arguments have challenged the evidence or pointed to linguistic
phenomena that would be inexplicable if sortalism were correct. For
example, the ability to refer to an object with a demonstrative
without invoking a sortal concepts poses an important challenge
(Goodman 2012). Experimental findings also indicate that
psychosortalism fails to accurately predict how people judge
individual artifacts and natural kinds. These results suggest that
relying on sortal concepts alone cannot fully account for our ability
to individuate and identify objects (Leonard and Rips 2015) or that
such concepts may not be necessary for individuation (Tiago 2009).</p>

<p>
Finally, it is important to distinguish perception and metaphysical
sortalism from predication sortalism. The latter posits that
predication is a cognitive act in which an entity (the subject of the
predication) is classified and cognitively singled out. Predication
sortalism claims that this act originates from the application of
sortal concepts. This view is compatible with anti-psychosortalism,
which holds that perception does not require sortal concepts. (For
predication sortalism, see Freund 2021).</p>

<h2 id="SorLog">11. Sortals and logic</h2>

<h3 id="SorStaLog">11.1 Sortals and standard logic</h3>

<p>
Some philosophers, perhaps most notably Carnap (1950) have used a
concept closely akin to sortals in formulating many-sorted logics.
There is a technical point to be explained and a controversy to be
discussed in relation to these.</p>

<p>
Sometimes in applications of first order logic, i.e., when we are
dealing at length with a specific class of interpretations the domain
divides into intuitively disparate kinds of objects, e.g., people and
numbers. In the usual formulation, one has predicates, e.g., \(Px\)
and \(Nx\) which are true of those kinds of things respectively, and
so one translates the English sentence &ldquo;All numbers are
odd&rdquo; as \((\forall x)(Nx \rightarrow Ox)\) and &ldquo;Some
person is tall&rdquo; as \((\exists x)(Px \mathbin{\&amp;} Tx)\). In a
many-sorted logic distinct variables are used for the different kinds
of objects, perhaps \(m\), \(n\),&hellip; for numbers and \(p\),
\(q\),&hellip; for people. In this language combinations of variables
with predicates are sometimes restricted so that \(Nm\) and \(Tp\) are
well-formed but \(Np\) and \(Tn\) are not. If one does not make this
restriction, then the notation is exactly equivalent to standard
first-order logic. A many-sorted language is expressively equivalent
to a single sorted one which has additional predicates for the various
sorts of things (cf. Quine 1966).</p>

<p>
From a purely technical point of view, one can introduce different
kinds of variables to reflect any distinction one wants, e.g., there
could be distinctive styles of variables for even numbers as opposed
to odd ones, or for left-handed people as opposed to right-handed.
However, Carnap and others who advocated a many-sorted logic for
reasons that were more ontological than pragmatic introduced different
variables only for what they believed were metaphysically distinct
kinds of entities, e.g., numbers, physical objects, sense data. In
this respect, there is some parallel with ultimate sortals as
discussed above, although Carnap does not make an explicit connection
with earlier writers.</p>

<p>
A related use of many-sorted logic is to provide a kind of translation
from second-order logic into a first-order logic. In this case instead
of having second-order quantification over sets (or properties), one
stays with a first-order language which is supplemented with a
predicate true of all and only sets (or properties), a distinct style
of variables for those entities, and with a two-place relation of
either membership or instantiation.</p>

<h3 id="LogSor">11.2 Logics of sortals</h3>

<p>
Standard logic treats all predicate expressions alike&mdash;the
predicates can be interpreted as any subset of the domain of
quantification. If any of the claims discussed above about sortals are
correct, then the sortal predicates have distinctive properties, and a
more sophisticated logical treatment might provide philosophical
illumination. One obvious and agreed on principle is that in general
the negation of a sortal predicate is not a sortal. This contrasts
with the predicates of standard logic where if \(F\) is a predicate,
so is \(\neg F\), (not-\(F\)).</p>

<p>
This principle holds regardless of which interpretation of
&ldquo;sortal&rdquo; you take. Not only is &ldquo;is not a cat&rdquo;
not a substantive sortal (Wiggins), but you also cannot count the
non-cats since they include dogs, table, molecules, <em>et
cetera</em>. However, for two of the other logical operators,
disjunction and conjunction, the situation seems more complex. The
expressions &ldquo;dog or cat&rdquo;, &ldquo;apple or orange&rdquo;
and &ldquo;fork or spoon&rdquo; all seem to be well-behaved with
respect to counting and identifying; we can easily imagine a city
ordinance forbidding homeowners to have more than four dogs or cats.
On the other hand, &ldquo;dog or natural number&rdquo; and &ldquo;cat
or clock&rdquo; seem to provide methods of counting but seem unnatural
as sortals.</p>

<p>
The first &ldquo;sortal logic&rdquo; was developed in Stevenson
(1975). Stevenson develops an account in which he says &ldquo;We use
ideas of Geach, Wallace and Wiggins, although we depart from each in
certain respects&rdquo; (1975: 186). Although the formalism follows
Wallace in some respects, the main ideas seem to be those of Wiggins
rather than Geach. Specifically, his theorem 3.4.5 affirms that for
any sortals <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, if <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are the same
<i>F</i>, and <i>b</i> is a <i>G</i>, then <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are
the same <i>G</i>, which is a denial of Geach&rsquo;s relative
identity thesis.</p>

<p>
Two principles that Stevenson adopts following Wiggins are:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="stevenson1">(i)</dt>
<dd> For every sortal <i>F</i>, either <i>F</i> is an ultimate sortal,
or there is an ultimate sortal <i>G</i> such that <i>F</i> is a
restriction of <i>G</i>.</dd>
<dt id="stevenson2">(ii)</dt>
<dd> If two sortals <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> intersect, i.e., they are
both true of at least one object, then there is a common sortal
<i>H</i> of which both <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> are restrictions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Stevenson proves the formal consistency and completeness of his set of
axioms. It should be noted that completeness here is with respect to
the language used. Since this is a minor adaptation of standard logic,
there is no treatment of tense or modality, some essential elements of
Wiggins&rsquo;s notion of sortal cannot be expressed, e.g., if a
sortal <i>F</i> applies to <i>b</i> at one time, then it applies to
<i>b</i> at all times at which <i>b</i> exists, and if a sortal
<i>F</i> applies to <i>b</i>, then <i>F</i> necessarily applies to
<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>
Stevenson does not permit combinations of sortal expressions,
presumably because there is no easy way to deal with disjunctions and
conjunctions of sortals in his formulation. However, a slight
complication of his language would suffice to handle the problem. He
uses &ldquo;\(uS\)&rdquo; for the ultimate sortal which governs sortal
&ldquo;\(S\)&rdquo;. If instead he introduced a set of letters \(U'\),
\(U''\) &hellip; for ultimate sortals, he could then superscript
sortal expressions to indicate the ultimate sortal that governs them.
He could then permit the disjunction of \(S^{U'}\) and \(T^{U'}\)
since they are governed by the same ultimate sortal, but forbid the
disjunction of \(S^{U'}\) and \(T^{U''}\) since they are governed by
different ultimate sortals.</p>

<p>
Cocchiarella (1977) presents a formal language, though no axioms or
rules, for a logic of sortals which includes both tense and modal
operators. His approach, like Wiggins, considers sortals to be
concepts. Unlike Wiggins he gives a definition of &ldquo;sortal
concept&rdquo;: as a socio-genetically developed cognitive ability or
capacity to distinguish, count and collect or classify things (1977:
441). He disagrees with Wiggins on both principles
 <a href="#stevenson1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#stevenson2">(ii)</a>
 above, arguing that while they may be true for natural kind terms,
there are no reasons to believe that there are ultimate sortals of
which various artifact sortals are restrictions, nor that every
intersection of sortals must fall under an ultimate sortal.
Cocchiarella&rsquo;s approach also goes beyond Stevenson&rsquo;s in
that it involves second-order logic, i.e., it includes quantification
over sortal concepts.</p>

<p>
Cocchiarella&rsquo;s ideas have been presented in more rigorous formal
detail with axioms and consistency and completeness results for
second-order logic in Freund (2000), tense logic (2001) and modalities
(2004). More recently, Freund (2019) has formulated several
bidimensional logics for sortals that consider modal, tense, and
epistemic modalities, as well as complex sortals (i.e., sortals that
involve logical combinations of other sortals). These systems
presuppose a conceptualist philosophical background closely related to
Cocchiarella&rsquo;s but somewhat more general.</p>

<p>
Belnap and M&uuml;ller develop an alternative account of sortals
within a non-standard formal logic for tense and modality. Unlike the
usual background of possible worlds for modality, they use ideas from
Bressan (1972) and adopt <em>cases</em> as the fundamental background
notion They define a sortal as a predicate which is modally constant
and provides separability. A predicate is modally constant iff it
applies necessarily to something whenever it possibly applies. The
idea is that while someone might possibly be a student without
necessarily being a student, if they are human, they are necessarily
human. Thus &ldquo;student&rdquo; is not a sortal but
&ldquo;human&rdquo; is. A predicate is modally separated just in case
it is necessarily true that if any two things having the property are
possibly identical, then they are in fact necessarily identical. Using
their technical terminology of cases, if two things which have a
modally separated property coincide in any case, then they coincide in
every case. Belnap and M&uuml;ller are explicit that they are
providing a formal framework for classifying predicates, but that
applications will require other kinds of thought:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
whether a particular predicate is absolute is assumed to be not a
matter of logic, but rather of science and metaphysics. (Belnap &amp;
M&uuml;ller 2014: 397)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="SorArtInt">12. Sortals and artificial intelligence </h2>

<p>
Guarino, Carrara, and Giaretta (1994) develop an account of sortals
within knowledge representation, a subfield of artificial intelligence
intended to bridge the gap between abstract formal logics and natural
languages. Their definition of a sortal is that it is a predicate that
provides countability and is temporally stable. A predicate provides
countability if it does not apply to any proper part of what it
applies to. As they explain this, &ldquo;student&rdquo; provides
countability because no proper part of a student is a student; but
&ldquo;red&rdquo; does not provide countability because parts of red
things are also red. Temporal stability means that if the predicate
applies to something at one time, then it must at some other times as
well. This is approximately the concept Strawson had in mind. They go
on to distinguish a subset of these, the substantial sortals. A
substantial sortal is one that, if it applies at all, necessarily
applies all times. This is in close agreement with Wiggins&rsquo; use
of the term. So while &ldquo;student&rdquo; provides countability and
is temporally stable, it is not ontologically rigid, so it is a sortal
but not a substantial sortal. On the other hand, a cat is always
necessarily a cat.</p>

<p>
Although there are obvious affinities with Strawson and Wiggins, it
should be noted that Guarino et al. (1994) are primarily concerned
with the distinction between kinds and properties of kinds, while the
philosophers were more concerned with things and the stuff they are
made of.</p>

<p>
We should also note that there is a shared core of concerns in these
last two approaches, it is clear that in addition to the superficial
difference that Belnap and M&uuml;ller restrict &ldquo;sortal&rdquo;
to approximately the substantial sortals as defined in Guarino et al.
(1994), there are differences even in the area of overlap. Modal
rigidity and modal constancy are very similar. (Some caution is
necessary here since the modal logic frameworks differ.) But Belnap
and M&uuml;ller emphasize modal separability and do not mention a
counting requirement, Guarino et al. (1994) require countability but
are not concerned with modal identities.</p>

<p>
In addition to Guarino et al. (1994), computational applications of
the notion of sortal can be found recently in <i>upper ontology</i>, a
relatively new field in computer sciences. For example, Guizzardi and
Wagner (2010) make central use of the notion of sortal in a conceptual
framework they call Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). This
framework can be used in the design and evaluation of conceptual
modeling languages. In UFO, the focus on sortals is on the identity
criteria they provide, which contrasts with Guarino et al. (1994)
where the emphasis is put instead on countability and persistence.
Besides, UFO makes a distinction, among sortals, between rigid and
anti-rigid sortals. An instance of a rigid sortal S will be an
instance of S in every possible world in which it exists. Anti-rigid
sortals will not comply with this feature. From the authors&rsquo;
examples and further claims, it is clear that rigid sortals correspond
to substance sortals and anti-rigid to phase sortals. Because possible
worlds are involved, UFO&rsquo;s framework seems to be committed to
individual essentialism. One will then ask whether UFO&rsquo;s general
goal is achievable, given the critique of such essentialism by
philosophers of biology. We should finally note that one can also
appeal to a tense logic framework to illuminate the distinction
between substance and phase sortals, in contrast with UFO&rsquo;s
modal approach. (See Rybola and Pergl (2016a, 2016b), and Miletic and
Sariyar (2022), for further examples of recent applications of the
notion of sortal in computational ontology.) </p>

<h2 id="Con">13. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
A large number of thoughtful philosophers have believed that the
category of <em>sortal</em> was philosophically significant and this
is a strong indication that there is something important they are
attempting to delineate and analyze. In the last two decades cognitive
psychologists and formal ontologists have applied the term in their
research. However, our dissection of the definitions and discussions
show that there are numerous distinctions in question and while these
distinctions have significant overlap, they are not identical. It
remains to be seen whether the sortal/non-sortal distinction marks one
very important difference, or numerous less important distinctions
related in complex ways.</p>
