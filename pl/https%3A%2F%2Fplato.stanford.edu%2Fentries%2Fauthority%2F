<h1>Authority</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jul 2, 2004; substantive revision Tue Oct 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Large social groups face many grave problems, such as violence,
injustice, disorder, public bads, and war, that require a coordinated
collective response. Because disagreement about the nature of and
solutions to these problems is pervasive, mounting any such response
is difficult in the absence of an authority empowered to issue and
enforce coordinating directives. The basic question of political
authority asks whether anyone has the right to impose such directives,
and if so, under what conditions.</p>

<p>
Some anarchist philosophers have thought that political authority is
neither necessary nor sufficient for solving the social problems
above. Indeed, some think that political authority is
counterproductive because it debars better strategies for solving them
(e.g. Marx and Engels 1846 [1972: 146&ndash;202] and Huemer 2012).
This entry surveys the main frameworks that philosophers have
developed in defense of a positive, non-anarchistic answer to the
basic question of political authority. To this end, we discuss
different concepts of the political authority&rsquo;s right to impose
directives on others (part 1) as well as different conceptions of who
has the right and how it is grounded (part 2). In a
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimate-authority.html">supplement on legitimate political authority in international institutions</a>,
 we highlight distinctive issues that arise when the basic question of
political authority is posed at levels beyond the nation-state.</p>

<h2 id="ClaIdePolAutRelNot">1. Clarifying the Idea of Political Authority and Related Notions</h2>

<p>
Most contemporary political philosophers distinguish the
non-normative, descriptive notion of <em>de facto</em> authority from
the normative notion of authority, and they accord explanatory
priority to the latter (Raz 1986: 25&ndash;28). On this view, to say
that the state is a <em>de facto</em> authority is to say that the
state maintains public order and it issues commands and makes rules
that are generally obeyed by subjects because many of them (or some
important subset of them such as state officials) think of it as
having authority in the normative sense.</p>

<p>
Note that many theorists outside of political philosophy tend to focus
on the conditions in which citizens by and large accept the
state&rsquo;s authority in the normative sense. Reflecting this focus,
such theorists oftentimes use the term &ldquo;legitimate
authority&rdquo; to refer to a polity that political philosophers
would characterize as a <em>de facto</em> authority (Weber 1918).</p>

<p>
Here, we focus on the question of political authority as construed by
the bulk of contemporary political philosophers. This question queries
the conditions, if any, in which the state has authority in the
normative sense over its members.</p>

<h3 id="ThrConPolAut">1.1 Three Concepts of Political Authority</h3>

<p>
We can usefully distinguish theoretical authorities from practical
authorities. A theoretical authority&rsquo;s judgment (e.g.,
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s doctor&rsquo;s judgment about a medical diagnosis)
is a reason to adopt the belief expressed by the judgment. By
contrast, a practical authority issues directives that are reasons for
action rather than belief.</p>

<p>
Some have argued that the idea of practical authority is incoherent
and so they have opted for the idea that political authorities are
theoretical authorities regarding the existence and nature of the
duties and reasons for action that people have (Hurd 2001). This entry
sets aside accounts that construe political authority as a species of
theoretical authority, focusing instead on the following three
commonly presupposed concepts: political authority as (1) the
justified issuance and coercive enforcement of directives (the liberty
to rule); (2) the normative power to impose duties, and (3) the right
to rule. These three concepts respectively refer to three different
normative statuses.</p>

<p>
The first concept specifies the status of being justified in the
governing practice of issuing directives and coercively enforcing
them, irrespective of whether anyone is duty-bound to act as directed
or to refrain from interfering with the state&rsquo;s enforcement
efforts (Ladenson 1980).</p>

<p>
The second concept appeals to the idea of a normative power. A
normative power is an agent&rsquo;s ability to alter her own or
others&rsquo; normative statuses &ndash; i.e., others&rsquo; profiles
of rights, duties, normative powers, and liberties &ndash; by way of
following some specified procedure. For example, by promising, I can
impose a duty on myself, and by consenting to someone&rsquo;s using
something of mine, I can give them a permission to use it where before
they had none.The second concept of political authority refers to the
normative power to impose moral duties by issuing directives &ndash;
specifically, duties to perform the directed acts, and a further duty
not to interfere with the authority&rsquo;s enforcement of its
directives. For example, a political authority might enact a speed
limit of 55 mph on the highway, thereby imposing a duty on its
subjects to keep to that limit as well as a duty not to interfere with
the authority&rsquo;s enforcement of the limit.</p>

<p>
A variation of this second concept holds that there is only a duty not
to interfere that stops short of a duty of obedience (Morris 1998 and
Edmundson 1988). While a duty to obey seems to imply a duty not to
interfere, there are cases of duties of non-interference that are not
duties to obey, such as the duties of foreign powers not to interfere
in the activities of a legitimate state. Furthermore, the duty to obey
is clearly the more contentious issue in the question of authority
since it requires that one make one&rsquo;s actions conform to the
specific directives of the authority.</p>

<p>
The idea of a claim-right is integral to the third concept of
political authority. According to this idea, a necessary correlate of
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s claim-right to phi (say, <em>A</em>&rsquo;s
claim-right to the use of Blackacre) is a duty or set of duties
binding on others that supports or facilitates <em>A</em>&rsquo;s
realization of the claim-right (say, the duty not to interfere with
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s use of Blackacre). According to the third concept
of political authority, to say that the state has legitimate authority
is to say that it has authority in the first two senses described
above. It is (a) justified in issuing and coercively enforcing its
directives and (b) it has the normative power to issue directives to
its subjects and thereby impose duties on them. In addition, (c) it
has a claim-right to rule that correlates to its subjects&rsquo;
duties as specified in (b).</p>

<p>
Each of these three concepts describes an aspect of the normative
status typically claimed by or often associated with political
authorities. As we will see, some theorists hold that the third
concept describes a higher form of political community, because such
authority involves the mutual recognition of rulers and subjects as
morally free and equal (e.g., Simmons 2001; Darwall 2010; and
Christiano 2008). Others focus on the concept of authority as
normative power (e.g. Enoch 2011and Raz 2010: 292). And yet others
forefront the concept of authority as a liberty to issue and
coercively enforce directives (Ladenson 1980 and Buchanan 2002: ch.
4).</p>

<p>
To be clear, not all political duties derive from authority. Some are
duties to participate in political authority, such as the duty to
vote, and some are duties to change political authority, such as the
duty of civil disobedience or even rebellion. This entry only
addresses duties that derive from political authority. Also, it bears
noting that not all authorities are political authorities. Here, we
only address political authority.</p>

<p>
In general, when we think of a state in a larger system of states,
each of these concepts of authority presupposes duties on the part of
other states and non-subjects outside the jurisdiction of the relevant
state not to interfere with that state&rsquo;s authoritative actions
or with the abilities of subjects to obey (Buchanan 2002).</p>

<h3 id="NorChaAutDir">1.2 The Normative Character of Authoritative Directives</h3>

<p>
As Robert Paul Wolff puts it: &ldquo;To claim authority is to claim
the right to be obeyed.&rdquo; (Wolff 1970: 6). Many theorists,
including Wolff, interpret this premise to mean that authorities claim
that their directives provide subjects with a distinctive kind of
reason for action: &ldquo;Obedience is not a matter of doing what
someone tells you to do. It is a matter of doing what he tells you to
do <em>because he tells you to do it</em>.&rdquo; (Id.; see also Raz
1979: 14&ndash;15 and Simmons 2016: 6&ndash;7 ). Moreover, such
theorists hold that an authority is legitimate only insofar as its
directives are reasons of the kind that authorities claim, and this
premise informs the common understanding of the idea of authority as a
normative power. On this view, a legitimate authority has the
normative power to generate reasons of the distinctive kind that
authorities claim; hence, an authority is not legitimate if its
subjects do not have reasons of this kind for following the
authority&rsquo;s directives.</p>

<p>
To be clear, the state is rightly satisfied by conformity with its
directives. It does not require any particular motivation (see Frick
&amp; Viehoff 2023). Nonetheless, the crucial claim that many
theorists of authority make is that a state is not a legitimate
authority unless it gives its subjects the reasons that it claims to
give them. On this view, the state implicitly claims that there is a
special normative relationship or a kind of normative community
between it and its subjects. Accordingly, a key issue is what these
claims come to.</p>

<p>
Common ground among most theorists is that the directives of a
legitimate authority are content-independent reasons for their
subjects. On this view, the duty of the subject is grounded not in the
content of the directive itself but in the nature of the source
issuing it. If the directive is issued by the appropriate authority
and it has the right form, the subject&rsquo;s reason to follow the
directive is automatically generated irrespective of its content (Hart
1982: 254&ndash;55 and Sciaraffa 2009).</p>

<p>
Some theorists characterize authoritative directives as especially
forceful content-independent reasons (Shapiro 2002 and Buchanan 2011).
Others argue that such directives are reasons that exclude and replace
competing reasons. The intuitive idea is that authoritative directives
defeat competing reasons by preempting rather than outweighing them,
reflecting the thought that to be obedient is to surrender one&rsquo;s
judgment to an authority (Raz 1986: ch. 3). Of course, a preemptive
reason might operate only with a limited scope and thus preempt only
some limited set of considerations.</p>

<p>
Joseph Raz supplies an influential precisification of this intuitive
idea. He argues that a preemptive reason to phi comprises a
content-independent reason to phi and a second-order reason (an
exclusionary reason) not to act for reasons for or against phi-ing
(see Raz 1999: ch. 2 and Raz 2010: 144). On this view, the scope of a
preemptive reason is fixed by the comprehensiveness of the set of
reasons that it excludes. For example, it might be that the manager of
a workplace has authority over employees that is limited to specifying
the employee&rsquo;s duties in the workplace. If so, the
employer&rsquo;s directive to perform some activity in the workplace
would preempt some competing reasons for their employees &ndash; e.g.,
that some other activity would be more efficient or fit better with
the workplace goals. However, other reasons might be outside the scope
of the manager&rsquo;s authority, e.g., the activity is dangerous or
immoral.</p>

<p>
Notably, Raz ascribes a highly comprehensive claim to the state (Raz
1999: 150&ndash;51). On this view, the state claims that its laws
preempt all reasons for action that apply to its citizens unless its
laws explicitly state otherwise (e.g. by issuing a directive requiring
the subject to act with reasonable care or in the best interests of a
beneficiary).</p>

<p>
Many who construe obedience in terms of pre-emptive reasons accept
Raz&rsquo;s conception of pre-emption. However, as Raz acknowledges,
there might be other ways of making sense of this intuitive idea (Raz
2010: 298; see also Enoch 2012: 23&ndash;28; Schauer 1991: ch. 3; and
Gur 2018: ch. 7).</p>

<h2 id="TheConLegPolAut">2. Theories of the Conditions of Legitimate Political Authority</h2>

<p>
Thomas Hobbes (1668) and David Hume (1965) have argued that there is a
general duty to obey the law or that political authority is generally
legitimate as long as the state secures sufficient peace and public
benefit. But most theorists argue that legitimate political authority
only obtains under more demanding normative conditions. We review here
some of the main theories that attempt to explain when a political
authority is legitimate, keeping in mind the distinction between the
three concepts of authority canvassed above: the liberty to rule, the
normative power to impose duties, and the right-to-rule.</p>

<h3 id="ConThe">2.1 Consent Theory</h3>

<p>
A. John Simmons (2001) and Leslie Green (1989) assert that all persons
possess a right not to be subjected to another&rsquo;s imposition of
duties and that this right can be waived only by way of consent.
Locke&rsquo;s <em>natural right argument</em> is a historical
antecedent of this view. Locke argues that each person has an equal
natural right to freedom and that this implies that at the age of
maturity no one may be subordinated to anyone else&rsquo;s commands by
nature (Locke 1690). For such subordination would violate the equal
freedom of the subordinated person.</p>

<p>
Two important features of Consent Theory should be noted. The first is
that it provides a <em>prima facie</em> plausible account of the
state-subject&rsquo;s duty of obedience correlative to the
state&rsquo;s normative power to impose duties on its subjects by
issuing directives that specify those duties. The idea is that consent
functions much like a promise, which is a paradigmatic instance of a
normative power to impose duties. However, by consenting to the
state&rsquo;s rule, the subject does not only impose a duty on herself
to conform to a broad range of the state&rsquo;s directives. She also
imbues the state with a normative power to impose duties on her by
issuing such directives, and she transfers some of her original
normative power to regulate her life and order her moral relations
with others. Second, any plausible consent theory places limits on the
scope of this power. For example, Locke holds that such power only
extends as far as consent can extend, and he adds that consent cannot
empower any authority &ldquo;to destroy, enslave, or designedly
impoverish [its] subjects.&rdquo; (Locke 1690: ch. 11, [1990, 135]).
It is also worth noting that the Consent Theory provides a <em>prima
facie</em> plausible account of a necessary condition of the
state&rsquo;s liberty to issue and coercively enforce its
directives.</p>

<p>
However, the Lockean natural right thesis combined with the further
premise that persons rarely consent to the authority of political
institutions implies a kind of philosophical anarchism. This variant
of anarchism holds that no state is legitimate and perhaps no state
can ever be legitimate because the state rarely receives the requisite
consent to its authority, and it is difficult to see how the state
might be set up in a way that would systematically secure such consent
from the population it governs (see Simmons 2001: ch. 6).</p>

<h3 id="TacCon">2.2 Tacit Consent</h3>

<p>
Locke (1690), in part desiring to avoid the obvious difficulties of
philosophical anarchism, introduced the notion of tacit consent. The
possibility of tacit consent allows that one may consent without
having to go through the usual motions associated with expression of
consent. For example, at a board meeting, one consents tacitly to the
chairman&rsquo;s scheduling a meeting if one says nothing when the
chair asks for objections to the proposal. And that tacit consent is
valid to the extent that the failure to object is understood as a kind
of consent and is voluntary (see Simmons 1976).</p>

<p>
The main problem with tacit consent is the problem of interpretation.
How does one interpret the actions of another so as to think of them
as consenting though they did not explicitly do so? Simmons argues
that for behavior to count as tacit consent, it must be explicitly
understood by all to be a kind of consent, it must be clear how and
when to perform the act or omission that constitutes tacit consent, it
must not be difficult to consent, and the costs of dissent must not be
prohibitive (see Simmons 1993: 80&ndash;90). But it is not obvious
that Locke had this in mind.</p>

<p>
An alternative to Simmons&rsquo;s account of the conditions in which
it is appropriate to attribute consent is the following: If a person
voluntarily resides in a territory over which the state has
jurisdiction, and that person benefits from the establishment of the
rule of law and all the other amenities the state provides, then that
person must know or ought to know that the state&rsquo;s provision of
these benefits depends on the obedience of the members of the society.
But if the person now continues to reside voluntarily in the state,
that person must know that others expect obedience from him unless he
is under some special exemption. He must know or ought to know, in
other words, that others can reasonably interpret his voluntary
residence as committing him to obedience to the laws of the state. So,
we have adequate reason to interpret a person&rsquo;s continued
voluntary residence as a form of consenting to abide by the laws of
the state.</p>

<p>
David Hume (1965) criticized this interpretive move. He argued that
given the extraordinary costs to most people of moving out of the
country of their birth, no one can sensibly interpret the voluntary
continued residence of a person in a state as a case of tacit consent.
He draws an analogy with a person who has been carried involuntarily
onto a ship by others and who now finds himself on the ship subject to
the commands of the captain and his only alternative is to throw
himself into a stormy sea. Hume argues that such a person&rsquo;s
remaining on the ship cannot be interpreted to be consenting to the
authority of the captain. The person is merely attempting to avoid the
terrible cost of getting off the ship. Similarly, Hume thinks that we
cannot interpret the continuing residence of a person in a state as a
case of consent to the authority of the state because we have no
reason to think that the continuing residence was chosen as a result
of reflection on whether it constituted consent.</p>

<p>
One might respond that it should be clear to this person that his
compliance is expected of him if he remains in the territory. And his
remaining in the territory thereby implies that he consents to the
authority of the territory. This would seem to be a basis for
interpreting the person&rsquo;s behavior as a case of consent. Hume
argues that they should know, but he thinks that this shows that the
argument from consent is an idle wheel. He thinks people are obligated
because of the public benefit the state brings and the importance of
compliance to the production of that benefit.</p>

<p>
The consent theorist will not be happy with this response since it
seems to bypass the right of each person to decide whether anyone and
who may have authority over them. Simmons thinks that there is no
necessity for a person to think about their situation in this way and
hence the interpretation problem remains alive. We will see more of
this problem below in the discussion of the particularity problem.</p>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s argument also challenges the voluntariness of tacit
consent to state authority, but it is not conclusive. In many cases,
persons undertake commitments to avoid some terrible cost, but they
nonetheless seem to be bound by those commitments. Consider that
people commonly consent to pay insurance premiums to ensure that they
will have health care when they most need it, and combatants promise
to lay down arms on the condition that the opponent will not harm
them. We do not think that these undertakings are invalid or that they
fail to obligate. So, the fact that the alternative would be terrible
is not a reason to think that persons could not undertake commitments
to the state by remaining within its borders (see Beran 1987).</p>

<p>
An important objection to the idea of tacit consent is that it begs
the question about how a state gets its authority. Some argue that a
group of persons that has no authority to issue commands in the first
place cannot require people to submit to their commands or leave a
piece of territory they falsely claim to be under their jurisdiction
(Brilmayer 1989 and Wellman 2001). Lea Brilmayer appeals to a modified
version of Simmons&rsquo;s boardroom example to press this point. In
the modified version, a window washer swings in and makes the proposal
that the chairman advanced in the original example. She contends that
it is obvious that the board&rsquo;s failure to register objections to
the window washer&rsquo;s proposal would not constitute their consent.
For only a duly constituted authority is empowered to make such a
proposal. But the claim to authority is precisely what tacit consent
is supposed to support. So, the tacit consent view seems to beg the
question. This criticism is right as far as it goes, but there are two
points to note about it.</p>

<p>
First, it is not a criticism of Locke since he clearly thinks that
tacit consent only legitimates and obligates under conditions where
there is a duly constituted authority. Locke thinks that the right to
rule of an authority must be traced back to an original act of consent
in the state of nature (where there is no prior political authority)
to form a political body. That political body then confers, by the
consent of all the members, authority on a particular institutional
arrangement (as long as it is minimally just). The function of tacit
consent as well as the consent of new members is simply to legitimize
this already created authority&rsquo;s rule over new members.</p>

<p>
Second, if Locke is right and consent can create authority out of the
state of nature, it may be possible for tacit consent to do the same.
We can imagine a state of nature scenario where a highly persuasive
person gets up amid the chaos and makes a proposal to create the
initial political body from the state of nature and then states very
clearly that if there are objections, they should be raised without
fear. And we can imagine the very same person making a proposal to
create the particular structure of authority over the political body
and calling for objections in the same way as before. There is no
obvious reason why this could not work. Locke did not suggest this,
but it does not seem impossible. Indeed, this could even work with a
state that has only <em>de facto</em> authority and hence is still in
the state of nature for Locke. It would be clear in this case that the
consent or tacit consent was being given to the <em>de facto</em>
authority, which then turns the de facto authority into a <em>de
jure</em> authority.</p>

<p>
These two points defeat the argument that tacit consent requires a
prior duly constituted authority. What Locke&rsquo;s picture suggests
is that consent, be it tacit or explicit, can be valid as long as the
proposal is made when there is no authority already in place. The
proposals can be drawn up by someone who has the right to make the
proposal. In the state of nature, anyone presumably has this
right.</p>

<h3 id="FunThe">2.3 Functionalist Theories</h3>

<p>
Consent Theory holds that consent is a necessary condition of the
legitimacy of authority, though it need not be a sufficient condition.
Thus, this theory attempts to make political authority compatible with
due respect for the opinions of its subjects. But we might wonder if
it doesn&rsquo;t go too far. For if consent is a genuinely necessary
condition of political authority, then it appears that individuals may
have the option of not obeying a perfectly just state that has
jurisdiction over the area in which they live. And they may do this on
perverse grounds, or they may simply wish to free ride on the benefits
that the state confers without having to undertake any of the burdens.
How can this withholding of consent be legitimate, and how can it
undermine the authority of a just state? It seems that in the effort
to express respect for the reasonable opinions of people, consent
theory has gone too far in giving respect to immoral, irrational and
unprincipled failures of consent (see Raz 2009: 159&ndash;63).</p>

<p>
Functionalist theories give voice to this concern. Theories of this
kind hold that a state is a legitimate political authority insofar as
its rule &ndash; its issuing and enforcement of directives &ndash; is
necessary for the realization of certain morally mandatory ends, where
securing Lockean freedom is but one possible characterization of these
ends. Other proposed morally mandatory ends include: rescue from the
perils of the state of nature (Wellman 1996, Hobbes 1668); democratic
governance (Christiano 2008); a minimally just system of social
cooperation (Buchanan 2002), and a system of property and contract
rights necessary for personal freedom (Kant 1797, Stilz 2009). The
core premise common to all functionalist theories is that some ends,
the morally mandatory ones, are of sufficient moral urgency to justify
the state&rsquo;s authority, irrespective of its subjects&rsquo;
consent.</p>

<p>
Note that this statement of functionalist theory elides the different
concepts of political authority. To remedy this, we distinguish two
threads of functionalist theory. The first appeals to functionalist
considerations to justify the state&rsquo;s liberty to rule (e.g.
Wellman 1996), whereas the second focuses on the subject&rsquo;s duty
to conform to the state&rsquo;s directives (e.g. Wellman 2001).</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Functionalist Theory and the State&rsquo;s Liberty to Rule</h4>

<p>
The key premise of any functionalist defense of the state&rsquo;s
liberty to rule is that the state is justified in issuing and
enforcing its duties because doing so is necessary to realize urgent
politico-moral values &ndash; the morally mandatory ends mentioned
above. The consent-theorist might argue that functionalist theory is a
kind of illicit utilitarianism of rights that purports to justify the
violation of persons&rsquo; rights against coercive imposition in
order to secure the realization of such ends (see Nozick 1974 and
Simmons 2001). On this view, the natural rights of persons are side
constraints against actions; they are not to be violated without
consent even if urgent goods are better protected as a consequence. At
this point in the dialectic, one key issue is whether there are side
constraints that cannot be overridden without consent, even for the
sake of ends, such as the general public&rsquo;s realization of
minimally just terms of social cooperation, Lockean freedom,
democratic governance, and so on mentioned above.</p>

<p>
In a similar vein, Simmons (2016) marshals his Boundary Problem to
embarrass functionalist theory. At the heart of this challenge is an
example in which one state involuntarily annexes territory of another
and thereafter secures mandatory moral ends for the annexed
population. The point of this example is to elicit the intuition that
the annexing state&rsquo;s rule is not justified. On that basis,
Simmons argues that something more than functionalist justification
must be required to establish the state&rsquo;s liberty to issue and
enforce its directives. For Simmons, this something more is the
consent of the state&rsquo;s subjects. Anything less is not sufficient
to overcome the side-constraint established by the equal right to
freedom.</p>

<p>
One response to this objection accepts the intuition but suggests that
it is compatible with the functionalist approach. That is, the
functionalist could argue that the intuitive force of Simmons&rsquo;
involuntary annexation thought experiment derives from the implicit
assumption that one of the defeating conditions of functionalist
justification is realized. For in the actual world, annexing states
invariably treat the annexed population unjustly, and they often
generate increased violence and disorder. In a similar vein, one might
argue that the intuition reflects the thought that typically any such
annexation involves unjustified coercion .</p>

<p>
Anna Stilz joins Simmons in the claim that functionalist justification
fails to specify a necessary condition of state authority. However,
she disagrees with him about the overlooked condition. For Stilz, the
key condition is not Lockean consent; rather, it is that the political
authority&rsquo;s rule must not violate its subjects&rsquo; political
autonomy or, in other words, their interest &ldquo;in being subject to
political institutions that in some way reflect their judgments and
priorities.&rdquo; (Stilz 2019: 28). Stilz&rsquo;s idea is that unless
political institutions reflect one&rsquo;s judgments and priorities in
the appropriate way, then &ldquo;substantial aspects of one&rsquo;s
life can come to seem hostile, threatening, and completely beyond
one&rsquo;s grasp&rdquo; and, as a result, &ldquo;it can become
difficult to maintain any sense of oneself as an agent who charts her
life in accordance with her own purposes.&rdquo; (Id. 31). Stilz
further argues that democratic rule on its own is not sufficient. An
individual governed by democratic institutions might nonetheless be
subject to political institutions that do not reflect her judgments
and priorities in the requisite way. (Id. 30) According to Stilz, the
state&rsquo;s rule is not justified absent the subject
population&rsquo;s affirmation of their participation in the political
community and their acceptance of the higher-order procedures and
values that structure that community. (Id. 33) To be clear the
requisite affirmation is not consent but rather a kind of alignment
between governing institutions and the attitudes of the population it
governs. The gist of Stilz&rsquo;s reply to the functionalist is now
in view. In cases of involuntary annexation, the political autonomy
legitimacy condition is not met.</p>

<p>
However, Stilz complicates her analysis to accommodate the
functionalist&rsquo;s concern with the perverse withholding of consent
to state rule. As she puts it: &ldquo;Where dissenters refuse to
acknowledge the requirements of basic justice, to recognize a duty to
cooperate in a legitimate state, or to respect others&rsquo;
equivalent claims to self- determination, then their values and
priorities can be overridden without any moral loss&rdquo; (Id. 40).
But of course, the key question is whether one can be a cooperator, as
defined by Stilz, and yet fail to affirm the values and procedures of
the annexing state that secures some requisite level of procedural and
distributive justice for its members. If there is no gap between the
conditions in which it is reasonable to withhold affirmation and the
conditions of fully just functionalist rule, then it is not clear that
Stilz&rsquo;s account and functionalism meaningfully differ. To see
this, if the only time we can reasonably withhold consent is when
there is no good functionalist argument for being ruled by certain
institutions rather than others, then Stilz&rsquo;s argument
isn&rsquo;t, in practice, distinguishable from functionalism. At best,
the interests Stilz identifies might function as a tie-breaker between
two institutions that are equally justified on functionalist
grounds.</p>

<p>
Here, we see a recent iteration of attempts to navigate two compelling
considerations that are often in tension with one another. The first
is that persons have a right not to be subject to coercive rule
without some sort of consent or consultation, and the second is the
concern that the realization of morally urgent ends might be held
hostage to the whims of a capricious few who would perversely withhold
consent. Functionalist theory accommodates the concern with the
perverse withholding of consent, Simmons&rsquo;s Boundary Problem
illustrates the import of consent, and Stilz&rsquo;s view is an
attempt to strike a balance between these two considerations (see also
Quong 2019 and Motchoulski 2022).</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Functionalist Theory and the Duty to Obey</h4>

<p>
In addition to identifying conditions in which the state has a liberty
to rule, some theorists appeal to functionalist theory to explain why
the state&rsquo;s subjects are duty-bound to conform to its
directives. For illustrative purposes, consider the variant of
functionalist theory that focuses on the end of securing justice. This
variant posits a natural duty of justice that requires persons to
promote just institutions, and it also holds that this duty is
satisfied by obeying the directives of a reasonably just state (see
Rawls 1971: 98ff).</p>

<p>
Simmons marshals the Particularity Argument as an objection to
functionalist accounts of the duty to obey the state that appeal to a
natural duty to support just institutions (see e.g. Simmons 2001:
47&ndash;48). As applied to this stripe of functionalist theory, the
key premise of the Particularity Argument is that the minimally just
state is but one of many just institutions, and the natural duty of
justice accords discretion to the subject to choose which of these to
support. The idea here is that just as Amnesty International may not
require me to pay dues to it regardless of my membership even though
these dues would clearly advance the protection of human rights, so
the state may not require me to comply with its commands even though
such compliance would advance the purposes of justice. Let us suppose
that the reasons clearly favor my support of Amnesty International.
Intuitively, it still may not require me to lend it support. Only if I
have voluntarily joined and voluntarily remain in Amnesty do I have a
duty to do what the conditions of membership require. And I am under
no obligation to join Amnesty; I may join other organizations to
fulfill whatever duties of aid that I have. So, whether I ought to
join Amnesty and be subject to membership dues is up to me. In the
same way, so the Particularity Argument goes, only if I voluntarily
transact to obligate myself to comply with the minimally just
state&rsquo;s commands can I be said to have a duty to support that
particular just institution.</p>

<p>
The functionalist rejoinder to the Particularity Argument denies that
the state&rsquo;s subjects have discretion to discharge their natural
duty of support by supporting institutions other than the state. In
this vein, the functionalist theorist might argue that the state does
not merely promote justice; it <em>establishes</em> justice. That is,
the state determines what justice requires in the relations between
individuals by defining the relations of property and exchange as well
as the institutions of the criminal law and tort law. To be sure,
justice is still an independent standard of assessment on this
account. The idea is that one can establish justice by means of many
different sets of rules. So, what is just in a particular circumstance
will depend in part on the set of rules that the state implements. To
the extent that the state determines the basic framework of rules for
a society in a minimally just way, it determines which actions are and
are not just. Hence, to treat others justly, one must comply with
state&rsquo;s rules that establish this minimally just framework.</p>

<p>
More generally, one way to think of the functionalist&rsquo;s idea of
a morally mandatory end (be it securing a stable social order,
instituting justice, and so on) is that any end of this kind can only
be realized by a collective coordinated response, centralized
institutional coordination is the only or best way to secure such
requisite coordination, and the end is of sufficient moral urgency to
ground a natural duty to support and comply with the directives of any
such indispensable coordinating institution. (Waldron 1993:
27&ndash;30; Klosko 2019; and Motchoulski 2022). If we think of
morally mandatory ends in this way, then the debate between the
functionalist and consent theorist becomes a matter of first-order
substantive debate about the reach of the functionalists&rsquo;
morally mandatory ends and how individuals can, and are morally
required to, contribute to their realization.</p>

<p>
For example, on Simmons&rsquo;s view, a plurality of values competes
with the functionalists&rsquo; morally mandatory ends, and in very
many cases, the state-subject has the right to organize her life
around such competing values rather than any such putatively mandatory
end. As he puts it in one passage: &ldquo;It is not obviously
unreasonable (though it may be un- or anti- many other things) to
prefer solitude and independence to cooperation. More importantly, it
is surely not unreasonable to prefer more limited or less coercive,
small-scale forms of cooperation to states (and all that states
involve).&rdquo; (Simmons, 2001: 151).</p>

<p>
Moreover, even if we have no choice but to organize our life around
certain values, such as the protection of basic rights, there may be
many ways of appropriately responding to that value in lieu of obeying
a political authority. For example, we might be free to choose either
to pay taxes to help fund the welfare state in accordance with the
state&rsquo;s laws or to donate to Amnesty International.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Functionalism and the Principle of Fairness</h4>

<p>
Christopher Wellman&rsquo;s brand of functionalist theory forefronts
the end of rescuing the state&rsquo;s citizens from the perils of the
state of nature or, in other words, the end of instilling a stable and
predictable social order conducive to persons&rsquo; security and
harmonious cooperation. Wellman argues that although the minimally
just state&rsquo;s liberty to rule is justified by virtue of the fact
that it secures this end by issuing and enforcing its directives, this
consideration is not sufficient to explain why the state&rsquo;s
subjects are required to comply with the state&rsquo;s directives. He
puts the key issue as follows: &ldquo;The plain truth is that any
given citizen&rsquo;s behavior typically has no discernible effect on
her state&rsquo;s capacity to perform its functions, and thus it is
descriptively inaccurate to suggest that one&rsquo;s obedience to the
law is necessary to secure important benefits&rdquo; (Wellman 2001:
742; see also Klosko 2019: 36&ndash;37).</p>

<p>
Wellman&rsquo;s thought is that the collective rescue of the
state&rsquo;s citizenry from the state of nature is a chore shared by
all the state&rsquo;s citizens and not just its governing officials.
On this view, this rescue is achieved by way of a collective effort in
which each subject does her part by conforming to the state&rsquo;s
law. In so doing, the citizens collectively realize the stable social
order necessary for security and harmonious cooperation. However, as
Wellman points out, this collective effort is a negligible
contribution case. That is, it is a case in which some good can only
be achieved via a collective effort, but at the same time, no
individual person&rsquo;s contribution to the effort makes a
difference as to whether or the extent to which the collective
effort&rsquo;s end is realized (see Nefsky 2017). Thus, it is not
immediately clear why any state subject would have a reason other than
avoiding sanction or the independent merits of the directed action to
comply with the state&rsquo;s directives. For no subject&rsquo;s
compliance or non-compliance with the state&rsquo;s directives makes a
difference as to whether the citizenry is rescued from the perils of
the state of nature.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that the realization of most any of the various
morally mandatory ends that functionalist theorists cite requires a
collective effort that faces the problem of negligible contributions.
We distinguished three concepts of authority at the outset of this
entry, and the second and third concepts imply a duty to obey. The
functionalist that adheres to either of these two concepts must
explain how the duty to obey arises, which entails at a minimum
explaining how subjects come to have a reason to act as the state
directs. The issue is that it is not clear that subjects have any
reason to contribute to the collective chore that is inevitably
necessary to secure any of the functionalist&rsquo;s morally mandatory
ends. Accordingly, any such functionalist explanation of authority,
construed in accordance with the second or third concept, is burdened
with addressing the problem of negligible contributions.</p>

<p>
In response to this problem, Wellman introduces the principle of
fairness. This principle holds that anyone who benefits from a
reasonably just, rule-based collective effort in which the
effort&rsquo;s contributors constrain their liberty in service of its
end is thereby bound to contribute her fair share to that effort in
accordance with that effort&rsquo;s rules. (Cf. Hart 1955: 185)
Wellman argues that the subject&rsquo;s fair share in the collective
chore of mutual rescue from the state of nature is compliance with the
state&rsquo;s directives. Thus, the state&rsquo;s citizens are bound
by a weighty moral reason to comply with the minimally just
state&rsquo;s laws, and this reason is grounded in the principle of
fairness and the imperative of rescuing one another from the state of
nature.</p>

<p>
Robert Nozick&rsquo;s (Nozick 1974: 93) example of a neighborhood
public address system illustrates a key line of objection to this
fairness-based account of the reason to comply with the state&rsquo;s
laws. In this example, members of a community take turns using a
loudspeaker in accordance with the rules of their cooperative scheme,
and they do so in order to provide entertainment for the general
community. Nozick argues that this example satisfies the conditions
that trigger the principle of fairness; it describes a reasonably just
rule-based cooperative venture that benefits others, and the
contributors to the venture constrain their liberty in order to
provide this benefit. And, yet, as Nozick further argues, it would be
implausible to insist that the recipients of this benefit are bound by
a duty of fairness to contribute to the loudspeaker scheme. For
Nozick, this example demonstrates that the principle of fairness is
subject to yet a further condition. Namely, the beneficiaries must in
some sense accept the benefit of the cooperative scheme if they are to
then be bound to contribute their fair share to the cooperative
scheme, but such acceptance rarely obtains (see Simmons 2001: ch. 1
and Klosko 2013).</p>

<p>
The functionalist&rsquo;s main response to this objection appeals
again to the idea of morally mandatory ends. On this view, morally
mandatory ends are unlike the modestly important end realized by the
loudspeaker coordination scheme; rather, they are &ldquo;indispensable
for satisfactory lives.&rdquo; (See Waldron 1993: 27&ndash;30 and
Klosko 2019: 48). The functionalist further argues that anyone who
reaps the benefit of a morally mandatory end-realizing cooperative
scheme is thereby bound by the principle of fairness to contribute her
fair share to that scheme, irrespective of whether she accepts the
benefit (see Wellman 2001; Klosko 2019; and Motchoulski 2022).</p>

<p>
A second objection to the functionalist-fairness hybrid theory rests
on the premise that the fairness principle applies only to those who
free ride on the efforts of others, but it does not extend to those
who do not do their part in a collective effort in service of some
other urgent moral end. This premise implies that someone who enjoys
the benefits of various tax-funded state projects would not violate a
principle of fairness by allocating her earnings to some altruistic
end, such as funding Amnesty International or Oxfam, rather than to
the state&rsquo;s tax agency. For in so doing, she does not unfairly
reap the benefits that others have foregone; rather she uses what she
would have paid in taxes to address others&rsquo; urgent needs. If
this objection goes through, the functionalist-fairness hybrid theory
would seem to fall to a variant of the Particularity Argument. Namely,
this strategy for explaining subjects&rsquo; reasons to obey the law
can establish only that the state&rsquo;s citizens must either
contribute their fair share to state-coordinated cooperative efforts
that realize a morally mandatory end or redirect that contribution to
some other effort of comparable moral worth.</p>

<p>
Notably, the functionalist-fairness hybrid account approximates but
does not ground a duty to obey the state&rsquo;s laws, where obedience
is understood as acting as the state directs for the reason that the
state directs. For at the most fundamental level, the principle of
fairness requires that the beneficiary of the state-organized
collective effort contribute her fair share to the collective effort,
and it is a separate matter whether this fair share requires strict
compliance with the state&rsquo;s directives. For example, a system of
taxation that funds various public goods might require a subject to
pay more or less than her fair share of taxes (see Klosko 2019:
102&ndash;03).</p>

<p>
Moreover, this account does not seem to ground a distinctively
pre-emptive reason that some theorists (as noted above) associate with
the duty to obey a political authority. For the core functionalist
premise is that by acting as the state directs, the subject
contributes to a collective effort that secures some morally mandatory
good. As Leslie Green (1989) and Raz (1989: 1189) have argued, this
premise seems to be a basis for an ordinary first-order reason to act
as directed that weighs in the balance against rather than excluding
and replacing reasons for not acting as directed.</p>

<p>
An alternative functionalist response to the problem of negligible
contributions relies on the idea of non-individual reasons rather than
the principle of fairness. According to this idea, persons are
duty-bound to perform their part in any cooperative scheme that is
necessary for the realization of ends of the utmost moral urgency,
irrespective of whether their individual contribution makes a
difference. The core intuition behind this principle is that without
it or something like it, sound practical reasoning would often result
in very harmful collective action failure (see Nefsky 2017 and Bajaj
&amp; Christiano 2025). For without such a principle, practical reason
would leave potential contributors bereft of reasons for contributing
in the all-too-frequent cases in which a collective effort is
necessary to realize some morally urgent good, but no individual
contribution, considered in isolation, would make a difference to the
effort&rsquo;s success.</p>

<h3 id="InsJusPolAut">2.4 Instrumentalist Justifications of Political Authority</h3>

<p>
Robert Paul Wolff (1970) argues that any rational person is bound by
an inviolable duty to act on the basis of her own moral assessment of
right and wrong in each instance of action. He further argues that any
person who complies with authoritative commands on grounds independent
of the moral merit of the commanded action thereby violates this duty.
Thus, Wolff defends a robust variant of philosophical anarchism
according to which political authority conceived in terms of a duty of
obedience to the authority is never legitimate. For theories of this
kind hold that for any legitimate political authority, there are some
circumstances in which the fact that the authority issues a directive
is sufficient reason for them to act as directed, irrespective of
their beliefs about the action&rsquo;s merits. Notably, Wolff&rsquo;s
version of philosophical anarchism is even more strident than the
variant based in Consent Theory. For the Consent Theorist allows that
it is possible to undertake a duty of obedience by consenting to the
state&rsquo;s rule, whereas Wolff argues that the duty of moral
autonomy wholesale prohibits obedience to another in any case.</p>

<p>
The Normal Justification Thesis (NJT) is the core tenet of Joseph
Raz&rsquo;s instrumentalist response to Wolffian anarchism. The NJT
asserts that &ldquo;the normal way to establish that a person has
authority over another person involves showing that the alleged
subject is likely better to comply with reasons which apply to him
(other than the alleged authoritative directives) if he accepts the
directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and
tries to follow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons
which apply to him directly.&rdquo; (Raz 1986: 53).</p>

<p>
The NJT presupposes two other theses. The first is the so-called
Dependence Thesis which holds that &ldquo;authoritative directives
should be based on reasons which already independently apply to the
subjects of the directives and are relevant to their action in the
circumstances covered by the directive.&rdquo; (Raz 1986: 47). For
instance, subjects already have reason to give a fair share of
resources for the common good. Authorities merely help them comply
with these reasons by issuing directives that establish an efficient
and fair system of taxation. The second is the Preemption Thesis. It
posits that the directives of any authority exclude and replace
first-order reasons.</p>

<p>
Taken together, the NJT, the Dependence Thesis, and the Preemption
Thesis comprise what Raz refers to as the Service Conception. The key
idea behind this conception is that the authority&rsquo;s power to
impose duties is grounded by its capacity to issue directives that
serve the authority&rsquo;s subjects in the following sense. The
subjects better conform to reasons that apply to them by following the
authority&rsquo;s directives rather than trying to conform to some of
their reasons directly. Notably, this strategy generates a piece-meal
justification of authority in which only those persons who would do
better by following the authority&rsquo;s directives are bound to do
so, and moreover, any such person is only bound to follow those
directives that enable her to better conform to her reasons. For this
reason, Raz casts doubt on the state&rsquo;s comprehensive claim to
authority over all its subjects and with respect to any subject matter
it might address.</p>

<p>
Raz further argues that &ldquo;[a] major, if not the main, factor in
establishing the legitimacy of political authorities is their ability
to secure coordination&rdquo; (Raz 2009: 153). Accordingly, he
incorporates these functionalist considerations into his
instrumentalist framework.</p>

<blockquote>
Knowing the limits of my knowledge and understanding and being aware
of the danger that my judgment will be affected by bias, and my
performance by the weakness of my resolve, I am aware of the
possibility that another person, or organization, might be better able
to judge when there are sufficient reasons for social coordination to
which I should contribute. (Raz 1989: 1192)

<p>
The thought is that sources of state directives, such as courts,
regulatory bodies, and legislatures, are often better able than most
state-subjects to judge when there are sufficient reasons for the
state&rsquo;s subjects to engage in some coordinated collective
action.</p>

<p>
In summary, the Service Conception brings into view a forceful
response to the Wolffian brand of anarchism. According to this
response, it is sometimes immoral to insist on acting autonomously
when one may actually act worse as a result of acting directly for
one&rsquo;s reasons rather than following the authority&rsquo;s
directives (see Raz 1986: ch. 3). Perhaps in homage to some of
Wolff&rsquo;s concerns about moral autonomy, Raz&rsquo;s Independence
Thesis (Raz 1989: 1182 and Raz 2010: 136&ndash;37) introduces a key
circumstance in which the NJT is undercut. Namely, a putative
authority might satisfy the NJT yet lack the power to impose duties on
its subject insofar as the subjects&rsquo; acting from her
understanding of her reasons is more important than better complying
with them. For example, it might be that a team of government
psychologists could in theory issue directives that would lead Alf to
better friendships than he would choose on his own, but it would
nonetheless be better if Alf acted on his own suboptimal understanding
of the relevant reasons.</p>

<p>
It is worth emphasizing two different ways of thinking about the
instrumentalist response to Wolff&rsquo;s challenge. According to the
first, the subject autonomously and justifiably believes that she will
better comply with the reasons that apply to her directly if she
simply follows the directives (see Placani 2021 and Raz 2010:
147&ndash;48). On this understanding, we can autonomously choose to
act in ways that involve some suspension of autonomous decision making
in particular cases. Both rule following and obedience to authority
might reflect such a choice. The key premise is that persons better
accord with the duty of autonomy when they act from such higher order
autonomous reflection. This is a direct response to Wolff. It accepts
a duty of autonomy but asserts that sometimes that duty requires that
one autonomously suspend first-order autonomous decision making in
particular occasions of action. Alternatively, one might challenge the
duty of autonomy altogether. On this view, we might act in accordance
with reasons that we are not even aware of and that are only thought
by another (in this case the authority). We still act in accordance
with this reason because our action is reliably connected with the
reason through the authority. But it is not the product of autonomous
reflection. To be sure, the reason could be understood as something
one might hypothetically autonomously agree to, but actual autonomy is
unnecessary. This is a fully external account and rejects the key
premise of Wolff&rsquo;s account.</p>

<h4>2.4.1 The Irrationality of Preemption</h4>

<p>
However we construe Raz&rsquo;s Service Conception, its power depends
essentially on the cogency of the idea of a pre-emptive reason. The
question arises, when are our first-order reasons so strongly opposed
to the action that we must override the preemptive reason? In the case
of rule-following, we sometimes encounter particular instances in
which following the rule is counterproductive. How do we determine
when we ought to follow the rule and when we ought not to follow the
rule? Does such determination involve the very deliberation about
particular instances that was meant to be excluded by the rule? Some
have argued that rule following cannot be rational since it cannot be
rational to ignore the particular facts of each case, and they have
leveled this same charge against Raz&rsquo;s idea of a preemptive
reason (see Hurd 2001; cf. Kiesewetter 2022). Raz&rsquo;s main
response to this criticism has been to say that we look for clear
cases in which the rule is to be overridden and ignore the other cases
and that only by doing this do we best comply with reason. Limiting
exceptions to the rule to clear cases obviates the need for
deliberation in every case.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 The Service Conception and the Right to Rule</h4>

<p>
Stephen Darwall (2010) posits that <em>A</em>&rsquo;s possession of
authority over <em>B</em> entails that <em>B</em> is duty-bound to
obey <em>A</em> and <em>A</em> has right-to-rule over <em>B</em>,
where this right-to-rule is grounded in <em>A</em>&rsquo;s standing to
demand that <em>B</em> comply with <em>A</em>&rsquo;s directives and
<em>B</em>&rsquo;s accountability to <em>A</em> for failing to comply.
He further argues that the NJT fails to specify conditions in which
<em>A</em> has a right to rule over <em>B</em>, and, hence, it fails
to specify conditions in which <em>A</em> has authority over
<em>B</em>.</p>

<p>
Darwall illustrates this objection with the example of a financial
advisor that provides her client with investment instructions. (Id.
258). Darwall stipulates that by following these instructions, the
client is likely to do better with respect to her prudential reasons
for investing than she would if she tried to follow these reasons
directly. Thus, this case satisfies the NJT, and, hence, the Service
Conception must hold that the financial advisor has authority over her
client. Darwall maintains that although it is in the client&rsquo;s
financial interests to comply with the advisor&rsquo;s investment
instructions, it is deeply counterintuitive to hold that the client is
accountable to the advisor for failing to do so or that the advisor
has standing to demand her client&rsquo;s compliance. Given
Darwall&rsquo;s premise that <em>A</em>&rsquo;s authority over
<em>B</em> entails <em>A</em>&rsquo;s right to rule over <em>B</em>,
i.e. <em>B</em>&rsquo;s accountability to <em>A</em> and
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s standing to demand compliance, Darwall concludes
that the NJT fails to specify conditions in which <em>A</em> has
authority over <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>
In response, Raz insists that the question of whether a person has a
normative power to impose duties by issuing directives is distinct
from the question of whether she has a right to rule over the subject
that correlates to the authority-subject&rsquo;s duty to obey her
directives. (Raz 2010: 290). On his view, a characteristic feature of
any duty is that it is a categorical reason &ndash; a reason that
applies to an agent irrespective of her desires, preferences, or goals
that she happens to have. Raz adds that the kind of duties that
political authorities impose are pre-emptive reasons; they are reasons
that exclude and replace rather than outweigh competing reasons. (Raz
2010: 291&ndash;92). Crucially, Raz allows that someone might be bound
by a duty so construed, but this need not entail any correlative
claim-right. More pointedly, Raz holds that Darwall&rsquo;s argument
that the NJT does not establish a duty that correlates to the
authority&rsquo;s claim-right is beside the point. For the NJT only
purports to establish that the subject is bound by a duty to act as
the authority directs, where this duty need not correlate to any
claim-right.</p>

<p>
For his part, Darwall maintains that an authority&rsquo;s normative
power to impose duties cannot be so cleanly separated from its right
to rule. For the central thesis of Darwall&rsquo;s moral theory holds
that &ldquo;there are four interdefinable, irreducibly second-personal
notions that together define a conceptual circle: the authority to
make a claim or demand, a valid (authoritative or legitimate) claim or
demand, accountability or responsibility to someone (with the relevant
authority), and a second-personal reason for acting (that is, for
complying with an authoritative claim or demand and so discharging the
responsibility).&rdquo; (Darwall 2010: 257). On this view, if an
authority&rsquo;s subjects are duty-bound to conform to the
authority&rsquo;s directives, there must be someone who holds the
claim-right that correlates to these duties. For all duties correlate
to claim-rights. Darwall further assumes that the authority must be
the bearer of this claim-right &ndash; albeit on the community&rsquo;s
behalf. Accordingly, Darwall objects to Raz&rsquo;s Service Conception
on the following basis:</p>

<blockquote>
The rough idea is that the NJT is only plausible at all in cases where
the relevant reasons involve background obligations of some kind or
other and that the idea of obligation is itself conceptually related
to that of accountability (I argue, ultimately to one another as
representative persons or members of the moral community). (Darwall
2010, 257)
</blockquote>

<p>
To be sure, we could set aside Darwall&rsquo;s concern with whether
the client is accountable to the financial advisor, and an interesting
issue would remain. Namely, the financial advisor appears to satisfy
the NJT, but it seems unintuitive to claim that the client is bound by
a duty to act as the advisor directs, even if we construe duties as
Raz does (see Hershovitz 2011).</p>

<p>
In response, Raz might deny that the financial advisor satisfies the
NJT (see e.g. Raz 2010: 300&ndash;01; but see Hershovitz 2011: section
3). To this end, Raz could argue that the financial advisor is merely
giving conditional recommendations. Since we are permitted to choose
not to pursue financial goods, we needn&rsquo;t follow the advice.
This way of thinking of the issue would require further conditions on
the NJT. A second response appeals to the Independence Condition,
according to which there are some cases in which we are directed to
follow our best conception of our reasons irrespective of whether the
NJT is satisfied (see Raz 2010: 136&ndash;37). For example, it might
be that I would do better with respect to some of my reasons by
following my friend&rsquo;s directives regarding a gift for my parent,
but in this case it might well be more important that I choose the
gift myself. Perhaps, the same could be said of the financial
advisor&rsquo;s recommendations about her client&rsquo;s decisions
about how to organize her life.</p>

<h4>2.4.3 The Wrong Kind of Reason</h4>

<p>
Darwall&rsquo;s second objection to Raz&rsquo;s Service-Conception is
that it provides a reason of the wrong kind for the obligation to
comply with authority. (Darwall 2010: 260). The basic idea is that the
NJT asserts that <em>A</em> has authority over <em>B</em> when
<em>B</em> has to treat <em>A</em> <em>as if</em> <em>A</em> has
authority over <em>B</em>. This, Darwall argues, gives us the wrong
kind of reason for complying with authority. Darwall compares this
with Kavka&rsquo;s toxin puzzle case in which a person acquires a
belief for pragmatic reasons (because it would be better for her
welfare to have the belief than not). Though pragmatic reasons support
having the belief, they are reasons of the wrong kind for justifying
the belief. Likewise, Darwall argues that the NJT gives us a reason
for treating a person as an authority or as if she were an authority,
but it supplies a reason of the wrong kind for justifying that
person&rsquo;s authority.</p>

<p>
We believe that Darwall moves too quickly in saying that the NJT
implies that if one has reason to treat someone as if they were an
authority that they are an authority. The NJT can avoid any kind of
locution containing &ldquo;as if&rdquo; in its formulation (see e.g.
Raz 2009: 136&ndash;37). The NJT states that <em>A</em> has authority
over <em>B</em> when <em>B</em> has a complex categorical reason to
act as commanded and to exclude other reasons for and against
performing the commanded acts (i.e., has a pre-emptive reason to act
as commanded) because acting as <em>A</em> commands and excluding
reasons for and against performing the commanded acts facilitates
<em>B</em>&rsquo;s acting in accordance with categorical reasons that
apply directly to him. The idea is that when the NJT is satisfied, the
authority subject does not merely have reason to act as if she has a
duty to act as directed; rather, she is bound by such a duty. For on
Raz&rsquo;s account, to be bound by a duty to phi just is to have a
categorical and pre-emptive reason to do so.</p>

<p>
<strong>2.4.4 An Ideal Form of Political Authority</strong></p>

<p>
Even if these responses to Darwall&rsquo;s wrong-kind-of-reason
objection are successful, there is something puzzling in the
neighborhood of this concern. Christiano modifies Bernard
Williams&rsquo;s George and the Nazis case to press this point.
(Christiano 2008: 233&ndash;34). As in the original example, George is
an opponent of the Nazis but has been asked by them to run a chemical
weapons factory, which he also opposes. Nonetheless, George accepts
the Nazis&rsquo; offer because he rightly believes he would be less
effective at it than any other candidate. By dint of this comparative
incompetence, he will better conform to his reasons for slowing down
the Nazis&rsquo; weapons production by acting as the Nazis direct and
excluding some of the reasons for and against the directed actions.
Thus, the NJT implies that the Nazis have authority over George, and
yet, this does seem like the wrong kind of reason for thinking that
the Nazis have authority.</p>

<p>
The Razian might argue that the intuition that the Nazis do not have
authority over George derives from a failure to distinguish the
various concepts of authority. In this vein, Raz suggests that
although governments claim to have authority construed as a normative
power to impose duties, they do not claim the right to rule. (Raz
2010: 290). Hence, the key question is whether the state has authority
in this limited normative-power sense.</p>

<p>
A potential problem with this response is that it seems perverse to
say that the Nazis in this case have authority of any kind. The idea
is that irrespective of whether it is construed as the
liberty-to-rule, a normative-power, or the right-to-rule, a legitimate
authority relation must be embedded in a minimally just system of
cooperation. Accordingly, the relationship between George and the
Nazis is not a legitimate authority relation because it is not
embedded in a minimally just scheme. At most, the Nazi political
system can have some pockets of authority, such as in the system of
traffic regulation and maybe some parts of the criminal law. The rest
is thuggery, which one might have to go along with to achieve good
outcomes as George does, but it does not display authority in any
normatively relevant sense.</p>

<p>
Some people argue that the Nazi case could be analyzed in a different
way. They distinguish between justified authority and legitimate
authority. On this view, to have justified authority is to have the
normative power to impose duties, but to have justified authority is
not yet to have legitimate authority. The pivotal thesis is that an
authority might have a normative power, but there might be all things
considered compelling moral reason for not having authority with such
power (see Marmor 2025). If so, the authority would be justified but
not legitimate. So contrary to the above claim, they might say that
the Nazis have a normative power over George and therefore have
justified authority though not legitimate authority. Although he might
not have the weapons-factory example in mind, Nathan Adams suggests a
way of modifying or refining the Razian position in a way that aligns
with this alternative analysis.</p>

<p>
Adams observes that the Service Conception does not explain the
state&rsquo;s &ldquo;standing to issue commands&rdquo; or, in other
words &ldquo;the power to demand practical deference from
others&rdquo; (Adams 2018). Accordingly, Adams introduces further
conditions that an authority must satisfy to have standing to issue
directives. Specifically, the authority must be sufficiently
trustworthy, and it must recognize the responsibility that comes with
its ability to issue directives that alter its subjects&rsquo;
reasons. Note that here, Adams idea of standing is similar to but not
exactly the same as Darwall&rsquo;s. For Adams, to have standing is to
be justified in exercising one&rsquo;s power as an authority to change
other persons&rsquo; duties by issuing directives. In summary,
augmented as Adams suggests, the Service-Conception can respond to
Christiano&rsquo;s modified weapons factory example as follows:
Although the Nazi supervisors satisfy the NJT and thereby have the
normative power to alter George&rsquo;s duties by issuing directives,
they do not have authority over George. For they do not satisfy the
requisite acceptance and responsibility conditions.</p>

<p>
But one might respond to this by saying that the putative authority
does not possess a normative power at all in this case, even though
they do make changes to the environment that generate duties. To say
that the putative authority possesses a normative power is to say that
there is something right about the entity&rsquo;s possession of the
normative power not just that the supposed subject acquires a reason.
To say that the authority is justified is to say there is some
important value realized by the entity possessing authority and not
just that reasons are generated in other persons. A key question is
how to distinguish between actions that are exercises of normative
powers in the relevant sense and actions that merely change reasons.
One might argue, as Raz does, that a person or person has a normative
power in this narrower sense only if there is undefeated value in that
person having that power (see Raz 2022: ch. 7)</p>

<p>
In a more conciliatory vein, one might say that there is merely a
terminological dispute here and that as long as the relevant
distinctions are maintained, there is no harm in characterizing the
situation in one way or another. But on the side of a less
conciliatory approach, one might argue that the difference depends on
whether something important is at stake in the distinction between
actions that are exercises of normative power and those that merely
change other persons&rsquo; reasons. The opponent of the conciliatory
approach might argue that both authority and the normative power
characteristic of authority imply a special kind of relationship of
convergence in which the authority and subject share the reasons at
issue in some way. Arguably, any theory of authority and its companion
notion of normative power must account for that relationship.</p>

<h4>2.4.5 Authority, Normative Powers and the NJT</h4>

<p>
In several passages, Raz seems to characterize authority in terms of
his conception of normative powers. So understood, an authority has
the normative power to impose duties on subjects by issuing directives
insofar and because its having this power is of undefeated value. (Raz
1979: 16&ndash;21; Raz 1999: 102&ndash;103; Raz 2009: 135&ndash;37;
and Raz 2022: 172). Raz leaves unanswered the question of whether and
how his Normal Justification Thesis relates to this characterization
of authority.</p>

<p>
A tempting thought is that the NJT specifies conditions in which it is
valuable for an authority to have the power to alter its
subjects&rsquo; duties by issuing directives. Namely, by having the
power to impose duties, the authority realizes the value of its
subjects&rsquo; better conformity to the reasons that apply to them.
However, there are at least two objections to this line of
argument.</p>

<p>
First, Raz&rsquo;s account of normative powers seems vulnerable to a
second wrong-kind-of-reasons objection. Commonly referred to as the
wishful thinking objection, this criticism holds that the question of
whether it is valuable for someone to have the power to change the
normative condition of others seems distinct from the question of
whether someone actually has that power (see Watson 2009: 162). In
response, some argue that the inference from &ldquo;it would be good
that P&rdquo; to P is illicit only in some contexts (see e.g. Bruno
2022; Enoch 2009; and Heuer 2025). On this view, the inference from
&ldquo;it would be good if I had the physical power to move
mountains&rdquo; to the conclusion that I have such power is invalid,
whereas the inference from &ldquo;it would be good if I had some
normative power&rdquo; to the conclusion that I have that normative
power is valid.</p>

<p>
The second issue is that the NJT does not seem to specify conditions
in which an authority&rsquo;s having the power to impose duties would
be valuable. (See Enoch 2020: 166n18, citing Richard Healey's
discussion of this issue). To be sure, under such conditions, the
subject realizes something valuable by following the authority&rsquo;s
directives. Namely, the subject better conforms to her reasons by
doing so. However, to establish that the subject&rsquo;s regular
conformity to the authority&rsquo;s directives is valuable is not the
same as establishing that the authority&rsquo;s possession of the
power to change the subject&rsquo;s duties is valuable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In light of these two concerns, a proponent of the NJT might appeal to
an alternative to Raz&rsquo;s conception of normative powers. For
example, some theorists appear to characterize the normative power of
an authority as the power to generate a content-independent reason or,
in David Enoch&rsquo;s terms (2012), a robust reason for action.</p>

<p>
Enoch holds that the exercise of this authoritative power has two
success conditions. First, the authority must attempt to give its
addressee a robust reason. As Enoch characterizes such an attempt, the
authority must intend to give the addressee a reason to act, the
authority must communicate this intention to the addressee with the
intention that the addressee recognize the intention, and the
authority must intend the addressee&rsquo;s given reason to act to
depend in an appropriate way on the addressee&rsquo;s recognition of
the authority&rsquo;s communicated attention. Second, the
authority&rsquo;s attempt must succeed in giving the addressee a
reason in the appropriate way.</p>

<p>
Enoch adds this second condition to distinguish instances in which the
given reason is generated in the appropriate way, thereby resulting in
the successful exercise of this normative power, from instances of the
wayward generation of the given reason. Enoch illustrates the need for
this distinction with the following example borrowed from David
Estlund: A dictator&rsquo;s child issues an order with the intent
described in the first success condition above, and if that order is
not satisfied, his father&rsquo;s government will respond with
violence. In such a case, the dictator&rsquo;s son has met the first
success condition, and he has generated a reason for compliance with
his order. However, this seems to be an instance of wayward
reason-giving rather than the generation of a reason via the exercise
of an authority&rsquo;s normative power. Reminiscent of the Nazi
supervisors discussed above, it seems perverse to characterize the
orders of the dictator&rsquo;s son as the successful exercise of an
authority&rsquo;s power &ndash; hence, Enoch&rsquo;s second
condition.</p>

<p>
A worry about this strategy is that the crucial distinction between
the appropriate and wayward generation of reasons is elusive (see
Monti 2021: 3741&ndash;44; Tadros 2020: 312; and Raz 2022: 163n4). For
his part, Enoch (2012: 9) concedes that little more can be said than
&ldquo;usually we know a deviant causal chain when we see
one.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>2.4.6 Justifying the Normative Power of Political Authority</h4>

<p>
At this point, it should be clear that the proper characterization of
normative powers is an important issue for any theory that adheres to
the second or third concept of political authority. Any adequate
theory of the conditions in which a political institution possesses
authority so conceived must explain the conditions in which the
institution possesses the normative power distinctive of political
authority. Because rival accounts of these conditions rest on
different conceptions of normative powers, it is useful to briefly
explicate some of the main conceptions that inform this debate.</p>

<p>
One key distinction is between theories that construe normative powers
as in some sense original and not reducible to other normative
elements from those that take powers to be constructed from other
materials and reducible to them. Here, it seems that persons have the
power to impose duties on themselves by virtue of their moral status
as persons. Plausibly, Locke and contemporary Lockean theorists, such
as Simmons and Nozick, hold such a view. On this account, persons
possess an original normative power to regulate their lives and
reorder their moral relations to others by virtue of their moral
status as persons, and consent to state authority is one way to
exercise this power. The effect of such consent is to give some of
one&rsquo;s powers to the state, which now may exercise those powers
over one. I can normally impose duties on myself, and I can give some
of this power to the State, which then can impose duties on me. For
example, I have powers over my property, some of which I give to the
state which in turn may now regulate that property or tax it (see
Simmons 1993: 62&ndash;64).</p>

<p>
By contrast, reductivist views hold that more basic normative
considerations create or ground normative powers. As we have seen, Raz
holds that political authorities have the power to impose duties on
their subjects by virtue of the fact that it is valuable that they
have such power, and other theorists (e.g. Enoch 2012) characterize
this normative power as the capacity to generate a content-independent
or robust-reason in the appropriate way. Several democratic theorists
hold that the duty to treat others publicly as equals grounds the
power of the democratic assembly. When a group makes a decision that
treats everyone publicly as equals in accordance with the publicly
egalitarian procedure and does not violate public equality, the
members have a duty of equality to act in accord with the decision.
They treat their fellow members publicly as unequals if they fail to
comply with the decision, which they have duties to do. Here the prior
duty of treating others publicly as equals is simply triggered by the
publicly egalitarian decision process (see e.g. Christiano 2008, and
see Enoch 2011 for the idea of a triggering reason).</p>

<p>
Notably, Darwall&rsquo;s account of political authority rests on a
contractualist ground that is difficult to categorize as either
reductive or non-reductive.</p>

<blockquote>
The lesson to draw from the failure of the NJT, I believe, is that the
only justification that can succeed is one that proceeds from within
the second-person standpoint, beginning with the assumption that we
all share a common basic authority to make claims and demands of one
another at all, and proceeding from there to consider what
differential claims to authority anyone could sensibly accept, or no
one could reasonably reject on that basis. (Darwall 2010:
277&ndash;78).
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Darwall seems to hold that <em>A</em> has the power to impose
duties on <em>B</em> only insofar as no one could reasonably reject
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s having that power.</p>

<h3 id="ReaConConLegPolAut">2.5 Reasonable Consensus Conceptions of Legitimate Political Authority</h3>

<p>
A key concern about the instrumentalist and functionalist approaches
is that they seem committed to the idea that an authority can be
legitimate even if most of the members of the society do not agree
with what it is doing. These views seem implausibly committed to the
thesis that political authority is completely independent of the
considered opinions of its subjects. Considerations of this kind
underpin the appeal of consent theory. For it requires that for the
state to have authority over any person, the state must obtain that
person&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p>
Reasonable consensus views of political authority attempt to find a
mean between the extreme individualism of consent theory and the lack
of respect for people&rsquo;s opinions exhibited by instrumentalist
and functionalist views. John Rawls argues that the liberal principle
of political legitimacy requires that coercive institutions be so
structured that they accord with the reasonable views of the members
of the society. On this view, it is not necessary that the authority
subject voluntarily consents to an authority. All that need be the
case is that the basic principles that regulate the coercive
institutions be ones that the reasonable members can agree to. (Rawls
1996).</p>

<p>
Views of this kind do not allow individuals to divest themselves of
obligations on spurious or merely self-interested bases; for they
specify what is and is not a reasonable basis for agreement to the
basic principles of the society. At the same time, they evince respect
for the opinions of the members of society since it requires that the
basic principles that regulate the society accord with the reasonable
views of the members.</p>

<p>
A key worry about reasonable consensus views is that they demand a
level of consensus among members of society that is incompatible with
the ordinary conditions of political societies. (Christiano 1996 and
Waldron 1999). If one attempts to come up with a notion of
reasonableness that is sufficiently robust to generate agreement on
the basic principles of society, then one is likely to have a notion
that is quite controversial. And then the view does not seem to take a
sufficiently respectful view of the opinions of the members of society
since so many are likely to disagree with the conception of the
reasonable. (Cf. Quong 2010: ch. 6) On the other hand, if one
elaborates a conception of the reasonable that is sufficiently weak
for most persons in the society to satisfy it, then one is not likely
to generate agreement on society&rsquo;s basic principles.</p>

<p>
One way in which Rawls has argued in favor of the attainability of the
consensus is to say that it need only be an overlapping consensus. The
overlapping consensus idea is that if a group of citizens agrees on a
set of principles for regulating society and some of the citizens also
think that some other principles apply, the citizens who hold the
idiosyncratic views must take those particular demands off the table
and must argue only on the basis of the shared principles. As long as
there are certain principles that everyone agrees to, which apply to
the basic structure of society, full consensus is not necessary.
Hence, the consensus need only be an overlapping one, and a legitimate
exercise of political power is one that is grounded only in those
principles that lie in the overlap. This seems to diminish the amount
of agreement necessary to make a society legitimate.</p>

<p>
But this appearance may be an illusion. To see why, consider a society
in which some hold that as a matter of justice, people ought to
receive in accordance with their desert, but others reject this
desert-based conception of justice. It would seem that in such a
society this desert-based view would fall outside the overlapping
consensus; it would be an idiosyncratic principle. In this case, the
principle of legitimacy implies that if the desert principle is used
to ground the basic institutions of society, then the basic
institutions of society are illegitimate. For they are not based on
principles everyone accepts.</p>

<p>
But surely the same can be said of those who hold the idiosyncratic
desert principle. They can complain that they are required to go along
with institutions that are unjust by their lights. The imposition on
them implied by the basic institutions that fail to distribute in
accordance with desert is as great as would be the imposition on the
others implied by institutions that do distribute goods in accordance
with desert. There is a complete symmetry here. Indeed, one way to put
this point is to say that those who hold that desert is not a genuine
principle of justice are themselves holding an idiosyncratic view when
we take into account the fact that many think that desert is a genuine
principle of justice.</p>

<p>
As a consequence of these considerations, only a complete consensus of
political principles will satisfy the principle of legitimacy that
Rawls defends. But complete consensus on political principles is
impossible to achieve given the conditions of ordinary political
societies. And so, to the extent that this principle of legitimacy is
unsatisfiable in ordinary political societies, it appears to be an
unacceptably utopian principle (see Christiano 2009).</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; view proposed by Gaus (2012a and 2012b)
belongs to the broader family of reasonable consensus views. This view
does not require agreement on underlying principles but merely
requires agreement on social norms and rules. Agreement here is a
complex notion because it does not imply agreement on the best rules;
it is more like coordination. Each person may have their separate and
distinct principles for evaluating political and legal organization.
And these principles help them rank different forms of organization.
The coordination involved is to be understood not in terms of the
interests of the parties but in terms of their moral rankings of forms
of organization. And the coordination is to be understood in terms of
improvements relative to some baseline, although the nature of this
baseline is a matter of debate. One possibility is improvement
relative to a baseline of no rules at all. Of course, this will mean
that often some will get a lot of what they think appropriate while
others will only get a bit. How one gets to these coordination points
is unclear though it could be through bargaining. The view generates
authority because each person has some reason based in their
perspective to adhere to the rules. Some rules are first order such as
the rule not to commit murder. Other rules are second order, such as
the rules constituting authority, which tell us how to create first
order rules. Societies generally coordinate on second order rules of
authority. So many have some reason to follow the authority (see also
Vallier 2011 and van Schoelandt 2015).</p>

<h3 id="DemConLegPolAut">2.6 Democratic Conceptions of Legitimate Political Authority</h3>

<p>
Like reasonable consensus views, democratic conceptions of political
authority attempt to find a mean between the extreme individualism of
consent theory and the lack of respect for people&rsquo;s opinions of
the functionalist views and the Razian view. The basic idea behind the
democratic conception of legitimate authority is that when it is
important that persons structure their shared world together despite
pervasive disagreement, the appropriate way to proceed is by way of a
decision-making process that is fair to the interests and opinions of
each of the members. On this view, those who refuse to act in
accordance with the rules or laws created in such a way thereby treat
their fellow members as unequals and unfairly.</p>

<p>
When there is disagreement about how to organize the shared system of
law, property, public education and the provision of public goods, no
one can have his way entirely in this context without someone else not
getting her way. Each person thinks that the ideas about justice and
the common good with which the others wish to organize their shared
world are mistaken in some way. Yet there is a need for collective
action. To settle on a course of collective action in a way that
treats all members equally and is reasonably fair to each, it is
necessary to do so by way of a democratic decision-making
procedure.</p>

<p>
Democratic theorists disagree about the fundamental grounds of the
democratic requirement. Some argue that there is a fundamental duty of
equal respect for the opinions of others that grounds democratic
decision making in the context of pervasive disagreement (see Singer
1974 and Waldron 1999). Others wish to ground this duty of respect for
the opinions of others in a deeper principle of equal concern for the
interests of each member of society (See Christiano 2008). Others
still argue that this must be grounded in a principle of equal status
(see Beitz 1989; Anderson 1999; Viehoff 2014; and Kolodny 2014).</p>

<p>
However grounded, views of this kind hold that the democratic assembly
has a right to rule that correlates to a duty of obedience borne by
each of its members. This right of the democratic assembly is grounded
in the right of each member of the assembly to be accorded equal
respect. The duty of equal respect requires that the collective
decision process gives each a vote in a broadly majoritarian process
and a robustly equal opportunity to participate in the deliberations
and negotiations leading to decisions. Some theorists add that this
duty of equal respect also requires each citizen to advance proposals
for organizing their shared institutions on the basis of reasons that
are compelling to their fellow citizens. (E.g. Cohen 1999; but see
Christiano 2009). In any case, the idea is that the equal rights of
each of the members are in effect pooled in the democratic assembly so
that because one owes each person equal respect, and the democratic
way of making decisions embodies this equal respect, one owes the
democratic assembly respect.</p>

<p>
The democratic assembly can be understood as the assembly of all adult
citizens or better as the assembly of all the democratically chosen
representatives of citizens. A conception of a democratic assembly
requires, on this view, an account of the appropriate form of
democratic representation (see Beitz 1989 and Christiano 1996). In
addition, the democratic assembly is only one part of the complete
system of government. It is concerned with legislation only. In
addition to this a government requires executive and judicial
functions whose legitimacy may depend in part on other factors better
grasped by the instrumentalist view. The democratic theory we are
discussing attributes a kind of intrinsic authority to the democratic
assembly and an instrumental authority to the executive and judicial
branches. The latter are instruments for the realization of democratic
decision making and for limiting democratic decision making in the
name of equality. (For a dissenting view opposing the merely
instrumental importance of courts, see Lafont 2020).</p>

<p>
The thought is that when an outcome is democratically chosen and some
people disagree with the outcome, as some inevitably will, they still
have a duty to go along with the decision because otherwise they would
be treating the others unjustly. If they refuse to go along and
disrupt the democratically chosen arrangements, they assume for
themselves a right to determine how things should go that overrides
the equal rights of all the others. They act contrary to the
collective decision that treated all as equals. To be sure, they are
not likely to undermine the whole system because each person&rsquo;s
obedience to law only makes a very small contribution to the
maintenance of law. But a collection of such actions similar to their
own will do damage to the legal system and thus will interfere with
the ability of equal citizens to determine the character of their
society. Hence, they have non-individualistic reasons to act in
accordance with egalitarian collective decisions, which are grounded
in the idea that one must treat one&rsquo;s fellow citizens as
equals.</p>

<p>
Notably, the duties owed to the democratic assembly are
content-independent reasons. For each member has the duty just because
the assembly has made a decision. Arguably, these duties are also
preemptive. On this view, the idea of equal respect requires not only
acting in accordance with the decision of the democratic assembly. It
also requires deference to the decision of the majority and not acting
on one&rsquo;s own judgment when the majority disagrees. So, the
decision of the majority gives a reason to obey that preempts or
replaces the considerations one might act on were there no majority
decision (see Christiano 2008).</p>

<p>
Democratic decision making on this account can be evaluated from two
very different angles. On the one hand, one can evaluate a democratic
decision in terms of the justice or efficiency of the outcome of the
decision. One can ask whether the legislation is just or for the
common good. This is the standpoint of the citizen who argues in favor
of legislation and against others and tries to organize a coalition of
more or less like-minded people to advance the legislation. On the
other hand, democratic decision making can be evaluated in terms of
the way in which the decision was made. Did the process of
decision-making treat all of its members fairly or with equal respect?
Are the institutions of legislative representation, political rights,
and of electoral campaigns, among others, fair?</p>

<p>
But why should the equality embodied in the democratic assembly trump
other considerations of justice? The democratic conception of
authority requires each person to submit issues to a democratic vote.
So if someone advocates some policy P on the grounds that it conforms
with what they take to be the correct principle of justice J, and the
majority chooses a different policy P&rsquo; on the grounds of an
incompatible principle L, the democratic theory says that they ought
to accept the policy that is grounded in L because only in this way do
they accord the proper equal respect to their fellow citizens.</p>

<p>
But someone might ask, why should the principle of equal respect take
precedence over principle J? They are both principles of justice, so
we need some reason for favoring the equal respect principle in
general over the others. One answer to this is to say that social
justice demands that principles of justice be public in the sense that
they involve principles that can be shown to be implemented to
everyone who is reasonably conscientious and aware of some basic facts
of political life (such as disagreement, fallibility and cognitive
bias). This is a version of the basic maxim of justice that justice
must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. The thought then is
that to the extent that there is significant disagreement about the
substantive principles of justice in play when policy is being
decided, a just society requires some way in which publicly to embody
the equal treatment of all the individuals in society. The
controversial principles guiding the formulation of policy do not
generally satisfy this constraint of publicity. Indeed, given the
controversies over justice, individuals will think that the policies
do not accord with their favored conception of equality. The
democratic process does seem publicly to embody the equal standing of
all citizens and the equal worth of their interests against the
background of disagreement and fallibility and all the facts that
attend these phenomena. So, the democratic process seems uniquely
capable of publicly embodying the principle of the equal importance of
each person and the equal importance of the advancement of their
interests (see Christiano 2008 and Estlund 2007).</p>

<p>
Critics of this democratic conception of political authority might
still take issue with the thesis that social justice requires that
principles be public and that this gives priority to the principles
that underpin democracy over those that underpin substantive policy
proposals. The question must be, why is publicity, in the sense
sketched above, so important? (See Arneson1993 and Wall 2006). The
answer some have given is that there are fundamental interests in
being able to see that the society one lives in is reasonably just and
advances the common good, at least in the circumstances marked by
disagreement, fallibility, and cognitive bias. (Christiano 2008).</p>

<p>
It is worth looking at some features of this democratic conception.
First, it is a direct response to Wolff&rsquo;s anarchistic challenge.
The thought is that the need to treat others as equals grounds a
reason to exclude one&rsquo;s particular views about justice when
considering obedience in the context described above. For one&rsquo;s
views have been taken into account in an egalitarian process of
collective decision-making. Second, the relation to Raz&rsquo;s Normal
Justification Thesis and the Service Conception is complex. According
to the democratic conception, each person acts better in accordance
with reason by obeying democratic law. So, in that respect,
Raz&rsquo;s Service Conception is satisfied. But there is one
difference: the consideration of treating others as equals in the
context outlined above is meant to be front and center to each
person&rsquo;s reason for compliance. Furthermore, the reasons that
are excluded are not excluded in order to act in accordance with them
but rather to act in accordance with equality. I obey because this is
necessary to treating my fellow citizens as equals. Third, the theory
proposed here suggests a highly reductive account of the normative
powers of the assembly. The duties to obey are triggered by the
collective decision-making of the assembly. Fourth, we can also say
something about how this abstract structure can respond to consent
theories&rsquo; central concerns. The democratic view is a kind of
functionalism, but it takes into account people&rsquo;s disagreements;
it takes account of the fundamental interests of persons in advancing
their understandings of justice. Fifth, some legislation will
undermine even the most basic equality among persons and so this will
not be legitimate (at least for most views in this group). Thus, there
are limits to the authority of democracy grounded on the very same
principles that generate the authority of the democratic assembly (see
the entry on
 <a href="../democracy/">democracy</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="AssObl">2.7 Associative Obligations</h3>

<p>
Another strategy for explaining the state&rsquo;s authority relies on
the idea of associative obligations, the rules and norms that govern
and constitute communities of various kinds, such as families,
friendships, and political societies. This approach has a storied
history, beginning with Plato&rsquo;s recapitulation of an account of
this kind in the <em>Crito</em>. (Plato 1948). Ronald Dworkin&rsquo;s
account of political obligation (1986) is an influential contemporary
attempt to ground the legitimacy of political authority in this way.
If successful, this account would explain how a political society can
have legitimate authority even if it is not a voluntary
association.</p>

<p>
Dworkin argues that communities that satisfy four conditions for being
genuine communities thereby generate obligations to go along with the
terms of the association. We can summarize these conditions as
follows:(1) The members of the community must see the
community&rsquo;s terms of association as special obligations holding
within the group rather than general duties owed equally to persons
outside the group; (2) they must see these obligations as owed by each
member to each other member personally rather than to the group as a
whole; (3) they must see these obligations as flowing from a more
general responsibility that each group member has of concern for the
well-being of others in the group; (4) and they must understand the
obligations as flowing from a plausible version of equal concern for
each community member. On this view, the community that satisfies
these four conditions is a genuine community in which all members are
obligated to comply with the community&rsquo;s terms of association.
(Dworkin 1986: 199&ndash;200).</p>

<p>
Dworkin&rsquo;s idea of constructive interpretation plays a key role
in his explanation of the normative ground and content of these
associative obligations. In the case of political communities, the
interpretive target is the community&rsquo;s past political decisions
&ndash; roughly speaking, the decisions made and enforced by the
community&rsquo;s political institutions, such as legislatures,
executive agencies, and courts. In this context, constructive
interpretation seeks to adduce principles of justice, fairness, and
procedural due process (politico-moral principles) that best fit and
justify the body of the community&rsquo;s past political decisions,
considered as a whole. Crucially, a key constraint on this
interpretation is that it must specify principles that satisfy a
minimally plausible conception of equal concern for the
association&rsquo;s members, as mentioned above. Dworkin argues that
insofar as the constructive interpretation of a community&rsquo;s past
political decisions yields underlying politico-moral principles that
satisfy this constraint, the community&rsquo;s officials are justified
in enforcing and the community&rsquo;s citizens are duty-bound to
follow the rights and duties that those principles imply. These rights
and duties comprise the associative obligations of the political
community or, in other words, they comprise the community&rsquo;s
political obligations.</p>

<p>
It is important to note that Dworkin&rsquo;s theory of political
obligation decisively rejects what we might call the standard picture
(see Greenberg 2011). Consider again the questions of political
authority framed by the three senses of political authority that we
have been considering. Is the state justified in issuing and enforcing
its directives? Does the state have the normative power to impose
duties on its citizens by issuing directives that specify the content
of those duties. Does the state have a claim-right to rule that
correlates to a duty to obey its directives owed to it by its
subjects? According to the standard picture, the contents of the
authority&rsquo;s directives are fixed prior to and independently of
whether those contents satisfy any objective moral tests. Whereas on
Dworkin&rsquo;s view, the very content of the directives must be
understood in the light of objective moral principles. Thus, Dworkin
reverses the standard picture&rsquo;s order of explanation. He argues
that the content of a community&rsquo;s political obligations is
derived in part from principles that fit and justify the
community&rsquo;s past political decisions. His view is that the
content of political obligations cannot be ascertained independently
of the principles that justify a community&rsquo;s political decisions
taken as a whole.</p>

<p>
To help see Dworkin&rsquo;s idea, consider <em>Riggs v. Palmer</em>, a
19th century New York state court case contesting the right of a
grandson to inherit his grandfather&rsquo;s estate on the grounds that
the grandson murdered his grandfather. Dworkin observes that this
inheritance would satisfy the letter of the relevant New York
statutes. On the standard picture, a key question is whether the
state&rsquo;s directives, such as those codified by New York law, are
authoritative. If so, there is a political obligation. By contrast,
Dworkin argues that <em>Riggs v. Palmer</em> corroborates the claim
that the content of political obligation is instinct within the body
of state political decisions, including New York Statutes and other
materials, considered as whole. On this view, there is a political
obligation to follow the principle that no one shall profit from his
wrong. For this objective moral principle best fits and justifies the
state&rsquo;s decisions. Accordingly, the state&rsquo;s officials are
not only legally obligated to debar the grandson&rsquo;s inheritance,
they are required as a matter of political obligation to do so,
irrespective of whether this obligation strictly complies with the
letter of the state&rsquo;s directives.</p>

<p>
A key question is whether the various theories of political authority
we have been considering can accommodate this non-standard picture.
One possibility is that some of these theories could construe
constitutional provisions in accordance with this non-standard way.
For example, the Lockean consent theorist might argue that any
constitutional provision in violation of the natural law must be
interpreted in a way that remedies this violation, and subjects have a
political obligation only with respect to this interpretation. By
contrast, it might be that the authority of the democratic assembly is
different than the authority of the constituent assembly. That is, the
former is an authority that determines the content of political
obligation because the background condition is serious disagreement
about the principles that ought to regulate the creation of statutory
law, whereas constitutional provisions are subject to a kind of
constructive interpretation animated by objective moral
principles.</p>
