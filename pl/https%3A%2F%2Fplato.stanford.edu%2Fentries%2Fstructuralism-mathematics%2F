<h1>Structuralism in the Philosophy of Mathematics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Nov 18, 2019; substantive revision Mon Mar 31, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The core idea of structuralism concerning mathematics is that modern
mathematical theories, always or in most cases, are meant to
characterize <em>abstract structures</em>, instead of referring to
more concrete objects, including sets, or providing mere calculating
techniques for applications. Thus, arithmetic characterizes the
natural number structure, analysis the real number structure, and
traditional geometry the structure of Euclidean space. As such,
structuralism is a position about the subject matter and content of
mathematics. But it also includes, or is closely connected with, views
about its methodology, since studying such structures involves
distinctive tools and strategies. Hence there are two related kinds of
structuralism: <em>metaphysical</em> and <em>methodological</em>.</p>

<p>
In English-speaking philosophy of mathematics, the introduction of
structuralist views is often taken to have happened in the 1960s, in
works by Paul Benacerraf and Hilary Putnam. Our survey will start
there as well. Debates about structuralist views picked up steam in
the 1980s&ndash;90s, when Michael Resnik, Stewart Shapiro, Geoffrey
Hellman, Charles Chihara, and Charles Parsons entered the fray. And
they have been reshaped again during the last 25 years, in terms of
philosophical challenges to and novel variants of structuralism. Most
of those challenges and variants involve <em>metaphysical</em> issues,
especially questions about how to think about mathematical objects and
about mathematical truth along structuralist lines; but a few also
concern <em>epistemological</em> questions.</p>

<p>
However, mathematical structuralism played a role already before the
1960s, especially if it is understood in the <em>methodological</em>
sense, where questions about how to organize, innovate, and articulate
mathematical practice are at stake. Structuralist positions in that
sense go back to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in
writings by Dedekind, Klein, Hilbert, Poincar&eacute;, Noether,
Bourbaki, etc. Today the two most influential versions of
methodological structuralism are <em>set-theoretic</em> and
<em>category-theoretic structuralism</em>, both of which lead back to
metaphysical issues, mainly by being related to foundational
ones<em>.</em> Relevant debates will be covered in the later parts of
this survey. It will end with some brief remarks about structuralism
<em>beyond mathematics.</em></p>

<h2 id="EliVsNonEliStr">1. Eliminative vs. Non-Eliminative Structuralism</h2>

<h3 id="BegStrDeb196">1.1 Beginnings of the Structuralism Debate in the 1960s</h3>

<p>
The discussion of structuralism, as a major position in
English-speaking philosophy of mathematics, is usually taken to have
started in the 1960s. A central article in this connection was Paul
Benacerraf&rsquo;s &ldquo;What Numbers Could Not Be&rdquo; (1965; cf.
Benacerraf 1996). The background and foil for this article was the
position, dominant at the time, that axiomatic set theory provides the
<em>foundation</em> for modern mathematics, including identifying all
mathematical objects with <em>sets</em>. For example, the natural
numbers 0, 1, 2, &hellip; can be identified with the finite von
Neumann ordinals (starting with \(\emptyset\) for 0 and using the
successor function \(f: x \rightarrow x\cup \{x\})\); similarly, the
real numbers can be identified with Dedekind cuts (constructed out of
the set of rational numbers). Arithmetic truths are then truths about
these set-theoretic objects. And this generalizes to other
mathematical theories, whose objects can be identified with sets as
well.</p>

<p>
As Benacerraf argued in his article, such a set-theoretic foundational
position misrepresents the <em>structuralist character</em> of
arithmetic in particular and of mathematics more generally. Thus,
instead of working with the finite von Neumann ordinals, we can work
equally well with the finite Zermelo ordinals (starting again with
\(\emptyset\) for 0 but using the alternative successor function \(f:
x \rightarrow \{x\})\); and infinitely many other choices are possible
too. Similarly, instead of identifying the real numbers with Dedekind
cuts, we can work with equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (again
constructed set-theoretically out of the rational numbers), as
suggested by Cantor and others. This insight about a <em>multiplicity
of options</em> is hard to deny and even set-theorist foundationalists
can agree with it. (More on set-theoretic responses to this challenge
below.) But Benacerraf drew further, more controversial conclusions
from his basic point.</p>

<p>
Benacerraf suggested, in particular, that the natural numbers should
not be identified with <em>any</em> set-theoretic objects. In fact,
they should not be taken to be <em>objects at all</em>. Instead,
numbers should be treated as &ldquo;positions in structures&rdquo;. In
contrast to the set-theoretic representatives mentioned above, all
that matters about such positions are their structural properties,
i.e., those &ldquo;stem[ming] from the relations they bear to one
another in virtue of being arranged in a progression&rdquo; (1965:
70). What we talk about in modern mathematics are, then, the
corresponding <em>abstract structures</em>, e.g., &ldquo;the natural
number structure&rdquo; and &ldquo;the real number structure&rdquo;.
It is in this sense that Benacerraf suggests a structuralist position.
The further details of that position are left open, however, including
how to think about abstract structures, except that they are not to be
identified with set-theoretic relational systems, i.e., models of
standard model theory.</p>

<p>
A second article from the 1960s that was influential in the rise of
structuralism is Hilary Putnam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mathematics without
Foundations&rdquo; (1967). Like in Benacerraf&rsquo;s case, for Putnam
the foil was a set-theoretic foundational position, where all
mathematical objects are identified with sets. This position is
sometimes, although not always, understood in a <em>realist</em> sense
(most famously by G&ouml;del), i.e., as the description of an
independent realm of abstract objects, namely the universe of sets
characterized by the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. In opposition to such
set-theoretic realism, Putnam suggested a form of <em>if-then-ism</em>
(a suggestion that can be traced back to Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s
works). This alternative can again be illustrated in terms of
arithmetic, now taken to be based on the Dedekind-Peano axioms. How
should an arithmetic theorem, say <span class="nobr">&ldquo;\(2+3=5\)&rdquo;,</span>
be understood now? It
should be analyzed as having the following form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For all relational systems <em>M</em>, if <em>M</em> is a model of the
Dedekind-Peano axioms, then \(2_M +3_M =5_M\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Here \(2_M\), \(3_M\), and \(5_M\) are those objects that &ldquo;play
the roles&rdquo; of 2, 3, and 5 in the model <em>M.</em>) Similarly
for the real numbers, based on the axioms for a real closed field
originally formulated by Dedekind and Hilbert.</p>

<p>
Instead of if-then-ism, one can characterize Putnam&rsquo;s position
also as a kind of <em>universalist structuralism</em>, since it
involves universal quantification over relevant systems and those
systems are a kind of structures (cf. Reck &amp; Price 2000 for this
terminology). Often an objection to such a position is the
<em>non-vacuity problem</em>. It is based on the observation that
if-then statements of the given form are vacuously true if there is
nothing that satisfies the antecedent, e.g., if there is no model of
the Dedekind-Peano axioms. (A sentence like &ldquo;\(2+3=6\)&rdquo;
would then also be true etc.) In response, axiomatic set theory can be
invoked as providing the needed models. But from Putnam&rsquo;s point
of view this is unsatisfactory, for two reasons: It relies on a
foundational view about set theory, thus undermining the anti-realist
thrust of if-then-ism; and set theory is then treated differently from
other mathematical theories, on pain of circularity. As a way out,
Putnam suggested to work with <em>modal logic</em> instead; but the
exact details were again left open.</p>

<h3 id="ConFurDis198">1.2 Consolidation and Further Discussions in the 1980s</h3>

<p>
One way to understand Benacerraf&rsquo;s 1965 article is that it
proposes to treat the natural number structure as a new kind of
<em>abstract entity</em>, different from all set-theoretic objects.
Mathematics then concerns what holds true in such abstract structures.
Along such lines, all depends on what exactly this amounts to,
especially whether one should treat such entities as objects, thus
<em>reifying</em> them in a substantive way (still to be worked out).
Benacerraf himself was reluctant to do so, in line with his overall
hesitancy to talk about mathematical objects.</p>

<p>
A subsequent writer who picked up on Benacerraf&rsquo;s ideas in the
early 1980s is Michael Resnik (cf. Resnik 1981, 1982, 1988, and, most
systematically, 1997). For him too, modern mathematics involves a
&ldquo;structuralist perspective&rdquo;. Following Benacerraf,
mathematical objects are viewed as positions in corresponding
&ldquo;patterns&rdquo;; and as Resnik adds, this is meant to allow for
taking mathematical statements <em>at face value</em>, in the sense of
seeing &lsquo;0&rsquo;, &lsquo;1&rsquo;, &lsquo;2&rsquo;, etc. as
singular terms referring to such positions. At the same time, doing so
is still not supposed to require reifying the underlying structures,
which for Resnik would mean specifying precise <em>criteria of
identity</em> for them, something he avoids intentionally. (He
presents himself as a Quinean on this point, by adopting Quine&rsquo;s
slogan: &ldquo;No entity without identity!&rdquo;) Instead,
Resnik&rsquo;s main focus is on the epistemological side of
structuralism (more on which later).</p>

<p>
Stewart Shapiro is a second philosopher of mathematics who attempted
to build on Benacerraf&rsquo;s paper (see Shapiro 1983, 1989, and most
systematically, Shapiro 1997). By focusing on metaphysical questions
and by leaving behind Benacerraf&rsquo;s and Resnik&rsquo;s
hesitations about structures as objects, Shapiro&rsquo;s goal is to
defend a more thoroughly <em>realist</em> version of mathematical
structuralism. Such realism includes the semantic aspect just
mentioned (taking mathematical statements at face value), but Shapiro
also clarifies the talk about &ldquo;positions in structures&rdquo;
further, by distinguishing two perspectives on them. According to the
first, the positions at issue are treated as &ldquo;offices&rdquo;,
i.e., as slots that can be filled or occupied by various objects
(e.g., the position &ldquo;0&rdquo; in the natural number structure is
occupied by \(\emptyset\) in the series of finite von Neumann
ordinals). According to the second perspective, the positions are
treated as &ldquo;objects&rdquo; themselves; and so are the abstract
structures overall.</p>

<p>
For Shapiro, the structures at issue thus have a dual nature: they are
&ldquo;universals&rdquo;, in the sense that the natural number
structure, say, can be instantiated by various relational systems (the
system of finite von Neumann ordinals, the system of Zermelo numbers,
etc.); but they are also &ldquo;particulars&rdquo;, to be named by
singular terms and treated as objects. To defend the latter further,
Shapiro develops a general <em>structure theory</em>, i.e., an
axiomatic theory that specifies which structures exist and how to
identify them. While clearly modeled on set theory, this theory is
justified independently (more on how below). As such, it is meant to
underwrite &ldquo;<em>ante rem</em> structuralism&rdquo;, a
terminology that refers to Medieval discussions of universals. The
crucial point is that the structures specified in the theory are meant
to be ontologically independent of, indeed <em>prior to</em>, any
instantiations of them. In other words, the structures do not just
exist in their instantiations, but separate to and before them.</p>

<p>
While Resnik&rsquo;s and Shapiro&rsquo;s structuralist positions are
sometimes identified, this is misleading given the differences already
mentioned. Nevertheless, there is some overlap. Both recognize
mathematical structures as patterns with positions in them (whether
these patterns are treated as full-fledged objects or not). Also for
both, the notion of <em>isomorphism</em> is crucial (or perhaps some
related, more general notion of <em>equivalence</em>; cf. Resnik 1997
and Shapiro 1997). That is to say, for Resnik and Shapiro a
structure/pattern can be instantiated by any of a relevant class of
isomorphic relational systems. This corresponds to the fact that the
axiomatic systems at issue&mdash;those for the natural numbers, the
real numbers, set theory, etc.&mdash;are <em>categorical</em> (or
quasi-categorical in the case of set theory). Not every mathematical
theory has that feature; e.g., the axiom systems for group theory or
ring theory allow for non-isomorphic models. According to both Resnik
and Shapiro, such &ldquo;algebraic&rdquo; theories are to be treated
in a different, more derivative way. Their structuralist suggestions
are meant to apply primarily to &ldquo;non-algebraic&rdquo; theories,
paradigmatically arithmetic and analysis.</p>

<p>
There is another structuralist position first introduced in the 1980s
that is quite different and explicitly <em>anti-realist</em>, namely
that promoted by Geoffrey Hellman (cf. Hellman 1989, 1996, and later
articles). While for Resnik and Shapiro the inspiration was
Benacerraf&rsquo;s 1965 article, the starting point for Hellman is
Putnam&rsquo;s 1967 article. In fact, Hellman&rsquo;s <em>modal
structuralism</em> is meant to be a systematic development of
Putnam&rsquo;s if-then-ism. The modal aspect, only hinted at by
Putnam, is now spelled out in detail, also including the case of set
theory (building on work by Zermelo etc.). For Hellman, an arithmetic
sentence such as <span class="nobr">&ldquo;\(2+3 = 5\)&rdquo;</span>
is to be analyzed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Necessarily, for all relational systems <em>M</em>, if <em>M</em> is a
model of the Dedekind-Peano axioms, then \(2_M +3_M =5_M\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And to address the non-vacuity problem, Hellman adds the following
assumption:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Possibly, there exists an <em>M</em> such that <em>M</em> is a model
of the Dedekind-Peano axioms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(We will come back to its justification below, which is surprisingly
close to Shapiro&rsquo;s in his structure theory.) Similarly for the
real numbers and for set theory.</p>

<p>
As Hellman makes clear, his goal is to develop a &ldquo;structuralism
without structures&rdquo; (Hellman 1996). In it, the existence of
abstract structures, postulated by Shapiro, is replaced by the modal
aspects of his position, i.e., the assumptions about necessity and
possibility just mentioned. In fact, Hellman&rsquo;s position is meant
to be a form of <em>nominalism</em>, by eliminating the appeal to any
kind of abstract entities (not only abstract structures but also sets
etc.). On the other hand, it is not meant to rely on
<em>possibilia</em>, i.e., possible objects existing in some shadowy
sense. This leads Hellman to take the modalities at issue to be basic,
i.e., the relevant possibilities and necessities are not reducible to
anything further. They are specified directly in terms of laws of
modal logic (those of the system <em>S5</em>). According to Hellman,
such possibilities and necessities are an irreducible feature of
mathematics, as his approach is meant to make explicit.</p>

<h3 id="FirTaxStrPos">1.3 A First Taxonomy of Structuralist Positions</h3>

<p>
From the late 1980s on, Shapiro&rsquo;s and Hellman&rsquo;s positions
have often been treated as the <em>two main structuralist
options</em>. (This is reflected in Hellman &amp; Shapiro 2019, among
others.) As they are quite different from each other, this already
indicates that it is wrong to see &ldquo;structuralism in the
philosophy of mathematics&rdquo; as a unique position or a unified
perspective, even though Shapiro&rsquo;s and Hellman&rsquo;s positions
share some structuralist features. And from the early 1990s on,
<em>other variants</em> of structuralism have started to play a role
as well. As a result, the discussions about structuralism in the
philosophy of mathematics became richer and more complex (although it
was still mostly restricted to metaphysical issues, as opposed to
adding methodological ones).</p>

<p>
To clarify the situation, Charles Parsons made several crucial
contributions. In particular, he suggested a <em>first</em>
<em>taxonomy</em>, based on the distinction between two main kinds of
structuralist positions (Parsons 1990). Namely, there are
<em>eliminative</em> forms of structuralism, like Hellman&rsquo;s; and
there are <em>non-eliminative</em> forms, like Shapiro&rsquo;s. (The
elimination at issue concerns the postulation, or avoidance thereof,
of structures as separate abstract objects.) Or put in Hellman&rsquo;s
slightly later terminology, there is <em>structuralism without
structures</em>, on the one hand, and <em>structuralism with
structures</em>, on the other hand. Besides Shapiro (and Resnik, with
the qualifications above), another proponent of the non-eliminative
form became Parsons himself (see Parsons 1990, 2004, and, most
systematically, 2008). And on the other side, another proponent of the
eliminative form of structuralism became Charles Chihara (cf. Chihara
2004).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless it remains widespread in the literature, even today (with
exceptions), to identify non-eliminative structuralism with
Shapiro&rsquo;s position and eliminative structuralism with
Hellman&rsquo;s. Moreover, many discussions of structuralism then
focus on Shapiro&rsquo;s <em>ante rem</em> side, explicitly classified
by him as a realist position as we saw. Given the latter focus, some
critics go on to dismiss &ldquo;philosophical structuralism&rdquo; as
a misguided form of <em>metaphysics</em>, one that is seen as
irrelevant for mathematical practice (cf. Awodey 1996 and Carter 2008,
more recently Carter 2024). But such a general dismissal is too quick
and inadequate in the end, as we want to emphasize. Even if one just
considers non-eliminative forms of structuralism, Shapiro&rsquo;s
position isn&rsquo;t the only option, as a further consideration of
Parsons&rsquo; position already makes clear.</p>

<p>
Unlike Shapiro, Parsons does not offer a novel, metaphysically
motivated structure theory. According to him, we can and should
instead remain closer to mathematical practice, as it developed from
the late nineteenth century on. In fact, for him structuralist views
should be seen as growing out of that practice, rather than being
imposed on it from outside by philosophers. For Parsons this means,
among others, to see abstract structures as introduced directly by
<em>categorical axiom systems</em>, a practice he spells out and
justifies further in a &ldquo;meta-linguistic&rdquo; way (again
inspired by Quine, see Parsons 2008). It also means for him that we
should refrain from <em>cross-structural identifications</em>, such as
identifying the natural number 1 and the real number 1 (as it can be
found in Shapiro&rsquo;s early works, although he later disavowed it).
Such putative identities are to be left <em>indeterminate</em>, as
Parsons assumes is done in mathematical practice.</p>

<p>
As this makes evident, Parsons&rsquo; structuralist position (like
Resnik&rsquo;s), is less realist than Shapiro&rsquo;s. In fact,
Parsons is explicit that adopting a &ldquo;structuralist view of
mathematical objects&rdquo; should be seen as separable from, and
orthogonal to, the realism/nominalism dichotomy. Consequently, for him
one can be a non-eliminative structuralist without being a realist in
any strong sense; his own position is meant to be a case in point.
Then again, Parsons&rsquo; structuralism still takes mathematical
statements at face value, so that it remains realist in this minimal
semantic sense. In that respect too, Parsons takes himself to follow
mathematical practice, e.g., with respect to talking about &ldquo;the
natural numbers&rdquo; in arithmetic.</p>

<h2 id="LatDevBroTax">2. Later Developments and a Broader Taxonomy</h2>

<h3 id="MetEpiCha">2.1 Metaphysical and Epistemological Challenges</h3>

<p>
So far we have traced discussions of structuralism in the philosophy
of mathematics from Benacerraf and Putnam, in the 1960s, to Resnik,
Shapiro, Hellman, Chihara, and Parsons, in the 1980s&ndash;90s. During
the last 25 years, a number of further philosophers have started to
address this topic. We now turn to the ensuing debates, beginning with
some <em>metaphysical and epistemological challenges</em> to
structuralism. Most of them concern non-eliminative structuralism,
with Shapiro&rsquo;s position as the main target. (This reflects again
its prominence.) But some considerations are broader, including the
comparison of basic commitments underlying eliminative and
non-eliminative forms of structuralism. In what follows, we will not
try to be comprehensive about the relevant debates, but just provide
six illustrative examples. (Later we will also move beyond such
metaphysical and epistemological issues; but as these examples
illustrate, they have dominated debates about structuralism to a good
degree.)</p>

<p>
Non-eliminative structuralism, in Shapiro&rsquo;s and other versions,
involves the thesis that all that matters about mathematical objects
are their <em>structural properties</em> (as opposed to further
intrinsic properties, e.g., set-theoretic ones). In fact, such
properties are taken to determine the objects&rsquo; identities. But
then, objects that are indistinguishable in this
respect&mdash;&ldquo;structural indiscernibles&rdquo;&mdash;should be
identified, shouldn&rsquo;t they? As several critics argued around the
year 2000, this leads to the <em>identity problem</em> for
structuralism (cf. Ker&auml;nen 2001, earlier Burgess 1999). It arises
for relational systems or structures that are <em>non-rigid</em>,
i.e., allow for non-trivial automorphisms. In such cases there are
supposedly distinct objects that are indiscernible in the relevant
sense. A widely known example is the system of complex numbers, with
the conjugate numbers <em>i</em> and &minus;<em>i</em>; but geometry
and graph theory provide further illustrations. The simplest example
is probably an unlabeled 2-element graph with no edges, whose two
vertices are structurally indiscernible.</p>

<p>
How can and should such cases be handled, if they can be handled at
all? Is structuralism (of the non-eliminative kind) simply incoherent,
as some critics charge? Or is it at least not applicable to non-rigid
cases, which would limit its reach significantly? Several
structuralist responses to the identity problem have been offered in
the literature. One is to <em>rigidify</em> such structures, by
enlarging the vocabulary that is used, e.g., by adding the constant
symbol &lsquo;<em>i</em>&rsquo; for the complex numbers (either into
the original language or into the language for the
&ldquo;setting&rdquo; used in the background, as suggested in Halimi
2019). However, this still seems problematic in certain cases,
especially when there are uncountably many indiscernibles. Another
suggestion is to treat identity as <em>primitive</em>, as is arguably
done in mathematical practice. Yet along such lines too, a number of
follow-up questions arise (see Ladyman 2005, Button 2006, Leitgeb
&amp; Ladyman 2008, Shapiro 2008, Menzel 2018, and Leng 2020, among
others).</p>

<p>
A second and more basic challenge for structuralism starts again with
the assumption that all that matters about mathematical objects are
their structural properties. With respect to non-eliminative
structuralism, this is sometimes understood or formulated in the sense
that the positions in mathematical structures, as well as the abstract
structures themselves, <em>only have</em> structural properties. But
that again leads to counterexamples quickly. For instance, does the
natural number structure as a whole not have the property that it is
the most widely used example in debates about structuralism?
Similarly, isn&rsquo;t it a property of the number 8, as a position in
that structure, to be the number of planets in the Solar System? Both
seem clearly non-structural properties. Once again, structuralism
appears incoherent, or at the very least, in need of further
clarification. (One advantage of eliminative forms of structuralism,
like Hellman&rsquo;s, is that they avoid both problems mentioned so
far; but they lead to others instead.)</p>

<p>
A natural response to this challenge is to refine the structuralist
thesis just mentioned, e.g., by saying that abstract structures only
have structural properties <em>essentially</em>, or that only such
properties are <em>constitutive</em> for them, while admitting that
they do have other properties (cf. Reck 2003, Schiemer &amp;
Wigglesworth 2019, also Assadian 2022). This leads to the question of
how exactly to make that distinction. Several structuralist responses
to it have again been proposed. (We will come back to some of them in
the next subsection.) But even if it we assume to have a satisfactory
response to this question, another one arises, thus a third basic
problem, namely: How can we distinguish <em>structural</em> from
<em>non-structural properties</em> in the first place? Several answers
to that question have been suggested in turn, e.g., that structural
properties are those definable in a certain way, or that they are
those preserved under relevant morphisms. Yet in that respect as well,
the debates continue (see Korbmacher &amp; Schiemer 2018, also for
more references).</p>

<p>
A fourth challenge directed again especially, or even exclusively, at
non-eliminative structuralism concerns the following: From a
structuralist point of view, positions are always &ldquo;positions in
a structure&rdquo;; i.e., the structure is <em>primary</em> and the
positions are <em>secondary</em>. Hence, a particular mathematical
object, such as the natural number 2, seems &ldquo;ontologically
dependent&rdquo; on the background structure, here the structure of
the natural numbers. (The fact that for a structuralist it is
misguided to consider the number 2 as existing in itself reflects this
aspect. It also illustrates a main difference between structuralism
and, say, set-theoretic foundationalism or neo-logicism.) Yet how
should this <em>ontological dependence</em> be understood? Are there
perhaps connections to <em>grounding</em> or related notions in
current analytic metaphysics? In this context too, a lively debate has
started and continues until today (cf. Linnebo 2008, also, e.g.,
MacBride 2005, Wigglesworth 2018).</p>

<p>
A fifth challenge for structuralism in its non-eliminative form is how
we can have <em>access</em> to structures taken to be abstract objects
(see, e.g., Hale 1996). To some degree, this revives an older, more
general debate about the possibility of knowledge about such objects
(cf. Benacerraf 1973). An initial response, shared by Resnik, Shapiro,
and Parsons (all following Quine in this respect), is to talk about
the <em>positing</em> of structures, which is meant to undercut the
access problem from the start. Then again, under what conditions is
such positing <em>legitimate</em> (given the threat of paradox
familiar from na&iuml;ve set theory)? A plausible answer to that
question points to the <em>coherence</em> of the relevant axiomatic
theories, which, after G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness results, is
seen as taking the place of provable consistency. (Compare
Hilbert&rsquo;s earlier suggestion that mathematical existence simply
amounts to the consistency of the theories at issue.) But this leads to
our sixth basic question: What exactly does such coherence amount to
and how can we establish it?</p>

<p>
With this sixth challenge, we have moved from metaphysics over to
epistemology. An interesting outcome of the resulting debates is that
it also brings us back to eliminative structuralism. Thus, Shapiro and
Hellman, coming from very different directions, have actually arrived
at suggestions that are <em>very close</em> to each other in this
connection (cf. Hellman 2005, Hellman &amp; Shapiro 2019). Namely,
with respect to <em>basic commitments</em>&mdash;ultimate conditions
for <em>existence</em> in Shapiro&rsquo;s case and for
<em>possibility</em> in Hellman&rsquo;s case&mdash;their approaches
converge, since they both appeal to coherence understood in a similar,
non-reducible sense. That convergence may be seen as providing support
for both sides, since they have arguably identified the same core
feature of mathematics. But it might also be taken to undermine the
realism/nominalism dichotomy, since it seems to imply that the
existence of abstract structures, properly understood, amounts to the
same thing as the possibility that underwrites modal
structuralism.</p>

<p>
There are more challenges to structuralism in the philosophy of
mathematics that one can find in the literature of the last 25 years.
While usually connected to the six problems just mentioned, sometimes
they go further. For example, additional questions about the semantics
involved in structuralism have been raised, typically again for the
non-eliminative variant but now including questions about
&ldquo;relational positions&rdquo; in structures (cf. Button &amp;
Walsh 2016, Assadian 2018, Button &amp; Walsh 2022, and Zalta 2024).
As a different kind of example, there is the question of how to
generalize eliminative structuralism, along Hellman&rsquo;s modal
lines and beyond, so as to cover all of of mathematics systematically
(cf. Zalta 2024). But instead of detailing such questions further, we
hope that our six examples above provide enough illustration of the
<em>kinds of debates</em> that have occurred in the recent literature.
As should have become evident, many of those debates concern
metaphysical issues, to a smaller degree also epistemological ones.
(Later we will come back to parallel debates about categorical
structuralism.) Moreover, they have led to additional variants of
structuralism, as we will see next. </p>

<h3 id="SevAddVarStr">2.2 Several Additional Variants of Structuralism</h3>

<p>
As already noted, in many discussions of structuralism, from the 1980s
to the early 2000s and beyond, a few positions have taken center
stage: often Shapiro&rsquo;s and Hellman&rsquo;s, sometimes
Parsons&rsquo;, occasionally also Resnik&rsquo;s. But several other
variants of structuralism exist, as we want to make clear now. Those
positions deserve, and have started to get, more attention in recent
years. Moreover, some of them go back to before the 1960s, sometimes
all the way to the mid- or late nineteenth century. As this shows, the
still widespread assumption that debates about mathematical
structuralism started during the 60s needs to be revised (even more so
if we bring in methodological structuralism, as will become evident
later). In this subsection, we will go over several especially
noteworthy examples. A major one, in several respects, is
<em>set-theoretic structuralism</em> (cf. Reck &amp; Price 2000,
Burgess 2015, and for its history, Reck &amp; Schiemer 2020b). To
introduce it, let us return to the illustration central to
Benacerraf&rsquo;s 1965 paper: the natural numbers.</p>

<p>
As Benacerraf argued, there is something wrong with identifying
&ldquo;the natural numbers&rdquo; with a particular set-theoretic
system; or more precisely, it is wrong to do so in an absolute sense.
As we saw, he concluded that numbers are not sets, or in fact, not
objects of any kind. Now, one can agree with almost everything
Benacerraf writes and still want to identify the natural numbers with
a set-theoretic system in a <em>less absolute</em> <em>sense</em>.
Doing so involves admitting that any other model of the Dedekind-Peano
axioms &ldquo;would do as well&rdquo;, i.e., could have been chosen
instead, except perhaps for pragmatic reasons (suggested by the
context). Yet we can still pick one and let it <em>play the role</em>
of the natural numbers. For most mathematical purposes such a
<em>provisional</em> and <em>pragmatic</em> identification is
sufficient. In fact, this is exactly what is done in standard ZFC set
theory (where the system of finite von Neumann ordinals is usually
picked, among others because it can be generalized systematically to
the infinite). Moreover, the resulting position, which goes back to
Zermelo in the early twentieth century, deserves to be counted as a
form of <em>structuralism</em>. What makes it structuralist is, among
others, the &ldquo;indifference to identify&rdquo; the natural numbers
in any more absolute sense (cf. Burgess 2015).</p>

<p>
The core of set-theoretic structuralism is to choose one of several
isomorphic systems as the provisional, pragmatic referent for
&ldquo;the natural numbers&rdquo; (similarly for &ldquo;the real
numbers&rdquo; etc.). As one may put it, our talk of &ldquo;the
natural numbers&rdquo;, then also of &ldquo;the number 0&rdquo;,
&ldquo;the number 1&rdquo;, etc., is <em>relative</em> to this
initial, somewhat arbitrary choice. This is taken to be unproblematic
since, no matter how we choose, we will get the same
<em>arithmetic</em> <em>theorems</em> (because of the categoricity of
the axiom system, which implies its semantic completeness). And as
background for this approach, it is usual to employ ZFC. But we
generalize it by also allowing for &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; or
&ldquo;urelements&rdquo; (objects that are not sets). We can even
include Julius Caesar or some beer mug in our domain, with the
consequence that (<em>pace</em> Frege) either of them can
&ldquo;be&rdquo; the number 2, say, by taking up the
&ldquo;2-position&rdquo; in the model for arithmetic we choose to work
with. This generalized approach deserves the name <em>relativist
structuralism</em> (cf. Reck &amp; Price 2000). Moreover, such an
approach, particularly in its set-theoretic version, is arguably
accepted by a large number of mathematicians today, explicitly or
implicitly. (Committed category theorists will be exceptions, as we
will see later.)</p>

<p>
In the case of relativist structuralism, the only mathematical objects
at play are those that axiomatic set theory, possibly with urelements,
provides. We do not need to postulate separate abstract structures,
along Shapiro&rsquo;s or similar lines. For that reason, the position
is another variant of eliminative structuralism, although it does not
eliminative all abstract objects (since it countenances sets). In
fact, set-theoretic <em>relational systems</em>, in the sense of the
standard models of theories, are often taken to be the relevant
<em>structures</em>. (It is exactly such systems that are called
&ldquo;structures&rdquo; in many mathematics textbooks.) Yet there are
at least two further options at this point, which lead to two
additional variants of structuralism. One of them is to identify the
structure of the natural numbers with the (higher-order)
<em>concept</em> defined by the Dedekind-Peano axioms; similarly again
for other categorical axiom systems. And this bring us to yet another
form of eliminative structuralism: <em>concept structuralism</em> (cf.
Isaacson 2010, Feferman 2014, also Ferreir&oacute;s 2021, where this
is called &ldquo;conceptual structuralism&rdquo;). Furthermore, that
position can be traced back even to the mid-nineteenth century, e.g.,
to the works of Hermann Grassman (cf. Cantu 2020).</p>

<p>
According to concept structuralism, what matters in mathematics
aren&rsquo;t really objects, especially not problematic abstract
objects. Rather, crucial are mathematical <em>concepts</em>, e.g., the
concept &ldquo;natural number system&rdquo; (&ldquo;model of the
Dedekind-Peano axioms&rdquo;, or in Russell terminology,
&ldquo;progression&rdquo;); similarly for the concept &ldquo;complete
ordered field&rdquo; etc. More precisely, what matters is what
<em>follows</em> from those concepts, in the sense of what can be
derived from the relevant axioms. It is true, as concept
structuralists can admit, that in mathematical practice we often
reason by talking about objects falling under those concepts. (If set
theory is the framework used, then we use sets for this purpose.) But
as they would want to add, such talk can be explained away in the end
(perhaps by taking up a formalist position). In this or similar forms,
concept structuralism is again a fairly widespread position among
mathematicians and logicians, explicitly or implicitly, even though it
has not been very prominent in the philosophical debates about
structuralism so far. An immediate challenge for the view is, however,
whether talking about concepts is less problematic than talking about
mathematical objects in the end (cf. Parsons 2018).</p>

<p>
We just introduced relativist structuralism, set-theoretic
structuralism as a special case, and concept structuralism. For the
sake of a comprehensive survey and to show that there really is a
<em>large variety</em> of structuralist positions, we need to go
further. As the next step, there are two forms of structuralism that
are closely related to relativist and concept structuralism but not
identical with either. Both are forms of <em>abstractionist
structuralism</em>, and in both cases it is convenient to work again
within a set-theoretic framework (although this too can be varied,
e.g., by using second-order logic instead). We can start once more
with the concept &ldquo;natural number system&rdquo;, together with
the set-theoretic relational systems falling under it. But instead of
identifying the relevant structure either with that concept or with a
pragmatically chosen system falling under it, let us now consider the
<em>equivalence class</em> of relational systems determined by the
concept. Finally, given that equivalence class we can go down one of
two &ldquo;abstractionist&rdquo; paths.</p>

<p>
On the first path, we now <em>identify</em> the structure at issue
with that <em>equivalence class</em>, i.e., we identify it with the
&ldquo;concept in extension&rdquo; as it is sometimes put, thereby
highlighting the proximity to concept structuralism. In our basic
example, connected with the concept &ldquo;natural number
system&rdquo; (defined by the Dedekind-Peano axioms), as well as with
each set-theoretic models corresponding to it (e.g., the system of
finite von Neumann ordinals, also the system of Zermelo natural
numbers, etc.), there is the whole equivalence class of all such
models as a <em>third entity</em>; and it is this class that we now
call &ldquo;the natural number structure&rdquo;. (Here the primary
focus is again on categorical axiom systems; but the approach can be
generalized, e.g., by considering broader notions of equivalence.)
This entity is not a set, of course, but a proper class. Nevertheless,
it can be studied logico-mathematically, e.g., within the framework of
Von Neumann-Bernays-G&ouml;del set theory, NBG. (By using what is
known as &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s trick&rdquo;, as is often done in such
contexts, we could also avoid working with the whole class and
restrict ourselves to a large subset of it.)</p>

<p>
Compared to relativist structuralism, this new approach can also be
characterized as follows: Its core is to go from a particular,
arbitrarily chosen system falling under a higher-order concept, such
as the concept &ldquo;natural number system&rdquo;, to the whole
equivalence class of such systems, i.e., the class of all models
isomorphic to it. Moreover, we can think of this move as a kind of
<em>abstraction</em>, specifically in the sense of the
&ldquo;principle of abstraction&rdquo; introduced and made prominent
by Bertrand Russell (cf. Russell 1903). This is the sense in which the
resulting position is a form of <em>abstractionist structuralism</em>.
In terms of its history, this approach can be traced back far as well.
In an explicit and systematic form, it was studied by Rudolf Carnap in
the 1930s-40s, who saw it as a development of Russellian ideas from
the early twentieth century (cf. Schiemer 2020, and see the discussion
of Carnap&rsquo;s structuralism in the entry on 
  <a href="../carnap/index.html#Stru">Carnap</a>). But there is another
abstractionist path we can take, involving a different form of
&ldquo;abstraction&rdquo;; and it too can be traced back far in time,
in this case to Dedekind&rsquo;s works from the 1870s-80s.</p>

<p>
For that second abstractionist option, let us start again from a
relevant higher-order concept, or from the axiom system defining it,
together with an arbitrarily chosen system falling under it (a
set-theoretic relational system, possibly with urelements). The
alternative suggestion is then the following: Given the arbitrarily
chosen model, we &ldquo;abstract away from the particular nature of
its elements&rdquo; so as to arrive at a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; system, in
the sense of a separate, distinguished <em>abstract structure</em>;
and we call that structure &ldquo;the natural numbers&rdquo; (cf.
Dedekind 1888). The intention along such lines is that the objects
introduced by such abstraction only have structural properties, or
better, they only have them essentially, since we have abstracted away
from all &ldquo;foreign properties&rdquo; (non-arithmetic ones in the
case of the natural numbers). And in contrast to the previous
approach, where the outcome of the abstraction is a whole equivalence
class, the resulting system is supposed to be <em>isomorphic</em> to
the one from which we started (cf. Reck 2003).</p>

<p>
Using this second form of abstraction&mdash;&ldquo;Dedekind
abstraction&rdquo;, as it is sometimes called&mdash;leads to a
position that, at least in terms of its outcome, is close to
Shapiro&rsquo;s <em>ante rem</em> structuralism (who occasionally
appeals to &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; himself, e.g., in Shapiro 1997).
Similarly it is close to Parsons&rsquo; non-eliminative position in
terms of its outcome. Yet the current approach involves neither an
appeal to Shapiro&rsquo;s structure theory nor to Parsons&rsquo;
meta-linguistic procedure. Instead, the relevant structures are
introduced &ldquo;by abstraction&rdquo; from set-theoretic relational
systems (possibly with urelements). What that amounts to can be
explicated further, also more formally, in terms of <em>an abstraction
operator</em> and corresponding <em>abstraction principles</em>.
Another comparison suggests itself, then, namely with the use of
abstraction principles in neo-logicism (cf. Linnebo and Pettigrew
2014, Reck 2018a). Having said that, informal versions of such
abstraction can already be found in mathematical practice (often within
a set-theoretic framework), namely when mathematicians think of
&ldquo;the natural numbers&rdquo;, &ldquo;the real
numbers&rdquo;&ldquo;the cyclic group with five elements&rdquo;, etc.
as separate from the usual set-theoretic models.</p>

<p>
The five additional forms of structuralism just
considered&mdash;relativist, set-theoretic, conceptual, and
abstractionist in two variants&mdash;all have historical roots in
works from before the 1960s. (They grew out of forms of methodological
structuralism, as we will see more below.) Each of them also has
proponents and implicit adherents later, including in the twentieth
century among mathematicians. And most of them rely on ZFC set theory
in the background (which thus needs to be conceptualized differently
in itself). Yet this is still not all in terms of available
structuralist options. If we look forward into the twenty-first century
now, there are several further variants of structuralism introduced by
philosophers and that should be covered in our survey as well. We will
mention three (the most interesting ones, in our view), without going
into much details in each case. One aspect these three final variants
share is the appeal to novel <em>background theories, </em>different
from set theory. Moreover, each arose in defense of
<em>non-eliminative structuralism</em> against the metaphysical and
epistemological challenges mentioned in the previous subsection.</p>

<p>
As a first illustration of such new approaches, Edward Zalta and Uri
Nodelman have introduced a form of structuralism that relies on an
axiomatic<em> objects theory</em>, inspired by Alexius Meinong, to
account for both the existence and the nature of abstract structures
(Nodelman &amp; Zalta 2014, Zalta 2024). A particular strength of this
approach is its ability to distinguish systematically between
&ldquo;accidental&rdquo; and &ldquo;essential&rdquo; properties of
objects in such structures, in terms of the difference between
&ldquo;encoding&rdquo; and &ldquo;exemplifying&rdquo; properties
provided in their object theory. As such, it provides novel answers to
several of the philosophical challenges above, especially the one in
which that distinction is challenged. More generally, the approach
offers an explicit and detailed metaphysical background theory for
non-eliminative structuralism. A remaining question is then whether or
to what degree that metaphysics is compatible with those implicit in
other non-eliminative positions, e.g., in the second form of
abstractionist structuralism mentioned above.</p>

<p>
Second, by building on Kit Fine&rsquo;s theory of <em>arbitrary
objects, </em>as another new background theory, Leon Horsten has
introduced <em>generic structuralism</em> (Horsten 2018, 2019). This
approach too allows for responses to some of the philosophical
challenges mentioned earlier. However, the unusual kind of objects
appealed to by Horsten (which share some properties with variables,
given how they are introduced in Fine&rsquo;s theory of arbitrary
objects) raises new questions in turn. As a third case, Hannes Leitgeb
has recently proposed to start from <em>graph theory</em> for similar
purposes, i.e., to develop an alternative framework for
non-eliminative structuralism (Leitgeb 2020a, 2020b). Leitgeb&rsquo;s
approach is well suited for addressing the identity problem for
structuralism from a mathematical point of view. And in other ways as
well, it stays closer to mathematical practice than either Zalta and
Nodelman&rsquo;s or Horsten&rsquo;s approach. Nevertheless,
Leitgeb&rsquo;s main goal, like theirs, is to clarify metaphysical
aspects of non-eliminative structuralism.</p>

<p>
As a final option, there is a whole family of <em>category-theoretic
forms of structuralism</em>. However, we will postpone their
discussion until later (Section 4), for two reasons: First, this
approach is especially important mathematically, thus deserving
treatment in a separate section. Second, it is harder to compare to
the forms of structuralism mentioned so far, since it is motivated
more by methodological considerations. Before turning to it, we will
do two things: We round off Section 2 by offering further
<em>taxonomic distinctions</em> for structuralist positions, thus
refining the taxonomic framework for our survey. After that (in
Section 3), we discuss several forms of <em>methodological
structuralism</em>, both to enrich our survey further and to provide a
better background for the subsequent treatment of categorical
structuralism.</p>

<h3 id="FinTaxDisForStr">2.3 Finer Taxonomic Distinctions for Structuralism</h3>

<p>
All the variants of structuralism discussed up to this point are forms
of <em>metaphysical structuralism</em>, or as it is sometimes also
put, of <em>philosophical structuralism</em>. What that means is that
they are primarily intended to provide answers to philosophical
questions about what mathematical structures are (even when this
involves an eliminative stance), in the sense of theses about their
existence, abstractness, identity, dependence, etc. Now, one can
distinguish this whole variety of positions from <em>methodological
structuralism</em>, or in alternative terminology (less helpful, we
think), from <em>mathematical structuralism</em> (cf. Reck &amp; Price
2000, earlier Awodey 1996). In fact, we suggest that recognizing this
basic dichotomy&mdash;metaphysical <em>versus</em>
methodological&mdash;is crucial for further advancing both the
systematic and the historical discussions of structuralism in the
philosophy of mathematics. (Among others, it will allow to include and
compare categorical forms of structuralism more naturally; cf. Corry
2004 and Marquis 2009.)</p>

<p>
As its name suggests, and as already mentioned briefly,
<em>methodological structuralism</em> concerns the methodology of
mathematics, thus mathematical practice. Or as one might also say, it
concerns a certain &ldquo;style&rdquo; of doing mathematics (cf. Reck
2009, Ferreir&oacute;s and Reck 2020). Basically, that style consists
of studying whole systems of objects in terms of their global,
relational, or structural properties, while neglecting the intrinsic
nature of the objects involved. This can be done in two ways that are
often intertwined in practice: by proceeding <em>axiomatically</em>,
i.e., by deriving theorems from basic axioms for the systems at issue;
and by considering <em>morphisms</em> between those systems
(homomorphisms, isomorphisms, etc.), together with invariants under
those morphisms (more on both side later). As this kind of approach
typically involves infinite sets, non-decidable properties, and
classical logic, it tends to be opposed to more computational or
constructivist ways of doing mathematics (cf. Stein 1988, Reck and
Schiemer 2020a).</p>

<p>
A structuralist methodology in this sense can be elaborated further in
several ways, beyond the general characterization just given, with
various forms of methodological structuralism as the result (see
Section 3). But at bottom, the methodology is tied to a general
assumption about the <em>subject matter</em> of mathematics, namely:
mathematics is the study &ldquo;structures&rdquo; (the natural
numbers, the real numbers, also various groups, rings, geometric
spaces, topological spaces, function spaces, etc.). At the same time,
accepting that assumption does not, by itself, involve views about the
<em>nature</em> of those structures, at least not in any detailed
metaphysical or otherwise philosophically loaded way. (Practicing
mathematicians who are guided by that assumption, often implicitly,
typically keep their distance from such metaphysical issues.) In
contrast, all the forms of metaphysical structuralism considered
earlier are meant to provide the latter. This is exactly how they go
beyond methodological structuralism (while presumably building on
it).</p>

<p>
So far we have clarified what we mean by &ldquo;methodological
structuralism&rdquo; (or again, what is sometimes meant by
&ldquo;mathematical structuralism&rdquo; in the literature, although
that label has also been used more broadly). With respect to
<em>metaphysical</em> positions, Parsons&rsquo; <em>eliminative vs.
non-eliminative</em> distinction remains helpful (while a more
positive label for the latter kind of positions, along the lines of
&ldquo;structuralism with structures&rdquo;, seems more adequate for
some purposes). Yet the significant differences between metaphysical
forms of structuralisms are not exhausted by it. In fact, only working
with Parsons&rsquo; distinction can obscure philosophically important
points. In particular, Shapiro&rsquo;s <em>ante rem</em> structuralism
is far from the only version of non-eliminative structuralism; nor is
Hellman&rsquo;s modal structuralism the only form of eliminative
structuralism. As tools for clarifying the corresponding debates
further, we will now suggest several <em>more fine-grained</em>
distinctions (many already implicit in what we wrote above).</p>

<p>
Let us first look again at <em>non-eliminative</em> structuralism.
Several positions that fall under that label introduce abstract
structures by means of corresponding <em>basic theories</em>. This
includes Shapiro&rsquo;s structure theory, but also, e.g., Nodelman
and Zalta&rsquo;s object theory, Leitgeb&rsquo;s adaptation of graph
theory, and Horsten&rsquo;s theory of arbitrary objects. All of them
lead to forms of <em>ante rem</em> structuralism, but significantly
different ones. In addition, there are forms of structuralism,
including one variant of non-eliminative structuralism, that are based
on <em>abstraction principles;</em> we therefore called them
&ldquo;abstractionist forms of structuralism&rdquo;. We discussed two
versions of them, which involved different kinds of structures as the
outcome of the abstraction process. (If we explicated the respective
abstractions as mathematical operations or functions, their arguments
would be the same but their values different.) One thing this makes
evident is that there are <em>abstractionist</em> and
<em>non-abstractionist</em> forms of non-eliminative
structuralism.</p>

<p>
If we reflect further on such issues, the roles of some other
distinctions and subdivisions become apparent, namely: between
<em>ante rem</em> positions and either <em>in re</em> or <em>post
rem</em> positions. Shapiro&rsquo;s is explicitly an example of
<em>ante rem</em> structuralism. In contrast, our first version of
abstractionist structuralism can be seen as a form of <em>post
rem</em> structuralism, because the equivalence classes used as the
structures in it are &ldquo;built out of&rdquo; their elements to
which they are thus <em>posterior</em>. In our second version of
abstractionist structuralism, there is a form of <em>posteriority</em>
involved as well. Here too, we start with a more concrete relational
system, usually a system of sets perhaps containing urelements, and we
introduce an abstract structure on that basis. The <em>prior</em>
versus <em>posterior</em> relation in that case is not based on the
element-class relation, but on a more fundamental
argument-function-value relation. And we end up with abstract
structures, as opposed to classes, as the result of the abstraction
process.</p>

<p>
On the side of <em>eliminative</em> structuralism, further
distinctions can be introduced as well. In particular, there are
<em>fully</em> <em>eliminative</em> positions, which avoid commitment
to any kind of abstract objects. Hellman&rsquo;s modal structuralism
is of this sort. But there are also <em>semi-eliminative</em>
positions, which avoid commitment to <em>sui generis</em> abstract
structures, but accept other, more concrete mathematical objects.
Set-theoretic structuralism is a good illustration; universalist
structuralism is another, at least when backed up by set theory.
Beyond that, should relativist structuralism, and set-theoretic
structuralism more particularly, be seen as a case of <em>in re</em>
structuralism, in the sense that here abstract structure exist
&ldquo;in&rdquo; their more concrete instantiations? Perhaps; but this
thesis does not seem forced on us (cf. Leitgeb 2020a/b for more). The
same question arises for <em>in re</em> forms of structuralism more
generally; the details of the position will matter. (For more on the
latter positions, sometimes labeled &ldquo;Aristotelian&rdquo; as
opposed to &ldquo;Platonist&rdquo;, cf. Pettigrew 2008 and Franklin
2014.)</p>

<p>
Yet another version of eliminative structuralism is concept
structuralism. If it is meant to work without any appeal to abstract
objects (e.g., by basing itself on formalism), it amounts to a
<em>fully eliminative</em> position. Questions remain, however, about
the appeal to <em>concepts</em>, including their existence, nature,
and identity (cf. Parsons 2018). Depending on the answers, a strict
nominalist may find this position unacceptable, namely if the concepts
are seen as another problematic kind of abstract entities. On the
other hand, if a concept structuralist allows for sets to play a
secondary role, it becomes a <em>semi-eliminative</em> position; i.e.,
structures conceived of as separate abstract objects are eliminated
(by reconceiving them as concepts), but set-theoretic systems remain.
Finally, another option might be to consider concept structuralism
merely as a form of methodological structuralism, in which case
additional metaphysical questions are brushed aside as irrelevant.
Here again, the details will matter. But let us now turn to
methodological structuralism in itself.</p>

<h2 id="EpiMetAsp">3. Epistemological and Methodological Aspects</h2>

<h3 id="PatPosConAbs">3.1 Patterns, Postulation, Construction, Abstraction</h3>

<p>
While discussions of structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics
often focus on metaphysical questions, occasionally these are tied to
<em>epistemological</em> questions. In the English-speaking
literature, an early illustration is provided by Michael
Resnik&rsquo;s works. As we already noted, his approach is distinctive
in two ways: by emphasizing the role of structures, but not fully
objectifying them; and by addressing, more than most, questions about
how we can <em>know</em> anything about such structures (cf. Resnik
1982, 1997). The main phenomenon Resnik points to in connection with
the latter is our ability to <em>recognize patterns</em>. Two simple
examples would be intuitive patters in geometry (involving points,
lines, etc.) and numerical patterns in arithmetic (concerning
numerical sequences represented by means of numerals etc.). The basic
suggestion for the latter is, then, that knowledge about the natural
number structure is grounded in recognizing the beginnings of such
patters, usually involving finitely many numbers, and then
generalizing to the infinite. If one considers education in
mathematics, there is clearly something to this suggestion. Yet
questions about the process of generalization remain.</p>

<p>
A second suggestion for how to account for our knowledge of structural
facts in mathematics, including our knowledge of structures as
abstract objects, has come up already as well. Namely, Resnik,
Shapiro, as well as Parsons all argue that modern mathematics involves
the <em>postulation</em> of various structures based on corresponding
axiom systems. Along such lines no access to some &ldquo;Platonic
heaven&ldquo;, as rejected by nominalists, is required (and more
positively, one can combine postulating with pattern recognition). In
this case, what remains are questions about when such postulations are
<em>legitimate</em>. Other variants of metaphysical structuralism,
including eliminative ones, involve related views. Thus in
Hellman&rsquo;s nominalist structuralism any claim about knowledge of
abstract objects is avoided, while mathematical knowledge is tied to
establishing certain if-then claims by mathematical proof, thereby
assuring their <em>necessity</em>. Yet an additional kind of modal
knowledge is required as well, involving mathematical
<em>possibility</em>. And as noted earlier, Hellman points to
the <em>coherence</em> of basic axiom systems here, parallel to
Shapiro&rsquo;s justification for postulating abstract structures.
Here one can ask: What kind of coherence exactly; and how can it be
established?</p>

<p>
Finally, in our two versions of abstractionist structuralism and in
related positions we begin with set theory. A basic kind of
mathematical knowledge consists, then, in learning how to perform
set-theoretic <em>constructions</em>. Here too, questions about the
consistency, or perhaps again the coherence, of the set-theoretic
framework remain, related to which such constructions are legitimate.
But an additional appeal to <em>abstraction</em>, which can take
several different forms, is important. Some kind of <em>knowledge by
abstraction</em> is thus involved as well, including questions about
how it is to be justified<em>.</em> This is not unrelated to pattern
recognition, postulation, and their legitimacy; but here the details
need to be spelled out in terms of abstraction principles, in one way
or another. Dedekind&rsquo;s version of structuralism, in particular,
stays close to the <em>methodology</em> <em>of modern mathematics</em>
in this connection, which provides the basis for more advanced kinds
of knowledge and understanding as well&mdash;the topic to which we
turn next.</p>

<h3 id="LevMetStr">3.2 Levels of Methodological Structuralism</h3>

<p>
With the appeal to set-theoretic constructions, related forms of
abstraction, etc., we have arrived at methodological questions about
mathematics. Broadly speaking again, a <em>structuralist
methodology</em> consists in studying whole systems of objects in
terms of their global, relational, or structural properties, while
neglecting the intrinsic nature of the objects involved. Such a
methodology has roots in traditional mathematics, which can be traced
all the way back to Ancient times (cf. Reck 2020). But it was further
developed and became more prevalent in the second half of the
nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, especially as far as
<em>infinite</em> structures are involved. Moreover, arguably the
first systematic employment and discussion of this methodology can be
found in the works of Dedekind (cf. Reck 2003, 2009, Ferreiros and
Reck 2020), although numerous other mathematicians contributed to it
as well (cf. Reck and Schiemer 2020a).</p>

<p>
This description of a structuralist methodology is still very general,
of course. In the recent literature one can find the beginnings of a
more differentiated treatment of it. In this context, we can
distinguish four <em>levels</em> or <em>kinds</em> of methodological
structuralism. (Probably more can be added in the end.) The most basic
level consists of studying an area of mathematics by first
<em>characterizing</em> the main structure at issue (a task that
relies on pattern recognition etc.), and based on that,
<em>proving</em> <em>theorems</em> about it. This is typically done
<em>axiomatically</em>, especially in the sense of the formal
axiomatics introduced and made prominent by Hilbert. Along such lines,
Dedekind, and in more familiar form Peano, characterized the natural
number structure by means of the Dedekind-Peano axioms and proved
theorems about it. Structuralism at this first level is the
culmination of doing mathematics more <em>conceptually</em> than
before (thus leading to concept structuralism, among others), as
opposed to earlier computational methods (cf. Stein 1988, Ferreiros
and Reck 2020).</p>

<p>
A second level of proceeding structurally in mathematics, one that
builds on the first, involves not just considering one structure but
the relationships between <em>several</em> of them. This can be done
by either invoking abstract structures or working with more concrete
instantiations of such structures, like in standard model theory. What
becomes crucial at this level is the consideration of various
<em>structure-preserving</em> <em>mappings</em> between such
structures, especially homomorphisms and isomorphisms. Using Dedekind
as an early source again, one example is his theorem that all models
of the Dedekind-Peano axioms (all &ldquo;simple infinities&rdquo;) are
isomorphic (the basis of his abstractionist structuralism). Perhaps a
more striking example is Dedekind&rsquo;s proof that the natural
numbers, as characterized by him, can be embedded homomorphically into
any recursively constructed system (thus anticipating category-theory,
cf. McLarty 1993). Later this approach was pushed further and made
more abstract in works by Hilbert, Noether, Tarski, etc.</p>

<p>
We reach a third level of structuralist mathematics when we
don&rsquo;t just consider one or a few closely related kinds of
structure, but attempt to characterize <em>all</em> <em>the</em>
<em>main kinds</em> of structures in mathematics, including their
interrelations. Paradigm examples of such an approach can be found in
the works of the Bourbaki group, including their distinction between
three kinds of <em>mother structure</em>: algebraic, topological, and
order-theoretic (cf. Heinzmann and Petitot 2020). In terms of
historical shifts, Bourbaki used set theory as the relevant framework
initially, but it was later replaced by category-theory (including the
notion of functor, universal mapping properties, etc.). In fact,
category theory can be seen as a systematic, even more abstract
development of exactly this kind of methodological structuralism.
Moreover, it is no exaggeration to say that such structuralism, either
in a set-theoretic or a category-theoretic form, has dominated large
parts of mathematics since the mid-twentieth century (cf. Corry 2004,
especially for algebra).</p>

<p>
A fourth level of methodological structuralism, or perhaps an
especially interesting procedure on the second level instead (since it
is more concrete again), has not found much attention in the
philosophical literature yet, while some mathematicians have started
to highlighted it. Here mathematicians investigate how some
mathematical theorem, proven in terms of structuralist background
assumptions in one part of mathematics, can be transferred to other
parts in fruitful ways. The terminology typically used for successful
cases is that of <em>structure theorems.</em> (A relatively recent
illustration is Szemer&eacute;di&rsquo;s Theorem; cf. Tao 2006.) In
this context the structuralist methodology is not used in a way that
is as global and abstract as on level three. Instead, the focus is on
particular theorems, while general assumptions remain in the
background. This strategy is again very significant in mathematical
practice and, as such, deserves more philosophical attention (cf. Ryan
2023, more generally also Carter 2024, for some forays into this
area).</p>

<h3 id="StrUndMat">3.3 Structuralist Understanding in Mathematics</h3>

<p>
When philosophers such as Resnik, Shapiro, and Parsons appeal to
pattern recognition and the postulation of structures, their goal is
usually to address very basic questions about <em>knowledge</em> in
mathematics, questions that are highlighted in traditional philosophy.
This still applies to the investigation of basic kinds of possibility
in mathematics, e.g., involving the notion of coherence in Hellman and
Shapiro. Usually the motivation for such appeals consists, at least in
part, in a desire to respond to skeptical or nominalistic challenges
to the very possibility of mathematical knowledge. Hence we are
dealing again with <em>philosophical structuralism</em>, although its
epistemological rather than its metaphysical dimension; and working
mathematicians are seldom interested in such work, since it
doesn&rsquo;t affect their practice directly.</p>

<p>
With the issues mentioned in the previous subsection this starts to
change, however. We have moved closer to mathematical
<em>methodology</em>, in a way that concerns mathematicians in their
own pursuits. Nevertheless, we are dealing with broadly
<em>epistemological</em> issues, in the sense of questions about how
we know things in mathematics, including fruitful strategies for
obtaining such knowledge. At the same time, what is at stake is not so
much basic <em>knowledge</em> but more advanced mathematical
<em>understanding</em> (also related notions such as mathematical
explanation). Traditional epistemology and philosophy of mathematics
have focused mostly on knowledge, usually in a fairly exclusive way.
In contrast, recent &ldquo;philosophy of mathematical practice&rdquo;
has become broader and reached further, including with respect to
methodological issues (cf. Carter 2024). In the philosophy of science
as well, there is renewed interest in the notion of understanding, as
opposed to knowledge, in that case tied to the relevant practices in
other sciences (see, e.g., De Regt, Leonelli &amp; Eigner 2013). In
our remarks, what has come into focus more specifically is
<em>structuralist understanding</em> in mathematical practice,
including its philosophical significance.</p>

<p>
The step-by-step crystallization of such structuralist understanding,
via the novel methodologies that made it possible, played a crucial
role in the emergence of modern mathematics in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. Arguably, it is what drove the rise of
<em>structuralism in mathematics</em> (see again Reck and Schiemer
2020a). But even for current philosophers of mathematics who are
skeptical about &ldquo;mathematical structuralism&ldquo;, perhaps
because of their (mistaken) identification of it with purely
metaphysical positions, this is an aspect they should not ignore.
Actually, a charitable way to interpret recent metaphysical or
philosophical structuralism, at least in some of its variants (perhaps
most clearly Parsons&rsquo;), is that it was motivated by the
realization that methodological structuralism had become quite
prevalent in mathematics, including raising new philosophical
questions. In any case, our discussion of structuralist understanding
has led to epistemological issues that are relevant for both
philosophers and mathematicians.</p>

<p>
Another advantage of including an explicit treatment of structuralist
understanding in this survey (more than before) is that this allows us
to incorporate <em>category-theoretic structuralism</em> better. As
already noted, category theory grew out of reflections on the
methodology introduced by Dedekind, Klein, Hilbert, Poincar&eacute;,
Noether, Bourbaki, etc. As such, it is primarily a form of
<em>methodological structuralism</em>, one meant to enhance
structuralist understanding further. But it has also been proposed as
a new <em>foundation</em> for mathematics, thus leading back to
metaphysical questions, as we will see in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="CatTheStr">4. Category-Theoretic Structuralism</h2>

<h3 id="CatTheStuMatStr">4.1 Category Theory as the Study of Mathematical Structures</h3>

<p>
Over the past two decades, a number of proposals have been made to
formulate a theory of mathematical structuralism based on category
theory, thus a theory, or theories, of <em>category-theoretic</em>
<em>structuralism</em>, or in slightly different terminology, of
<em>categorical structuralism</em>. We are now in a better position to
consider these proposals, although we will still proceed indirectly,
starting with more background. Category theory was first introduced as
a branch of abstract algebra, in Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac
Lane&rsquo;s famous article, &ldquo;General Theory of Natural
Equivalences&rdquo; (1945). It subsequently developed into an
autonomous mathematical discipline, in work by Mac Lane, Alexander
Grothendieck, Daniel Kan, William Lawvere, and many others, with
important, wide-ranging applications in algebraic topology and
homological algebra, more recently also in logic and computer science
(cf. Landry &amp; Marquis 2005, as well as the
 <a href="../category-theory/">entry on category theory</a>
 in this encyclopedia).</p>

<p>
Building on these developments, the philosophical discussion of
categorical structuralism was initiated by Steve Awodey, Elaine
Landry, Jean-Pierre Marquis, and Colin McLarty in the 1990s. To
understand their contributions, our distinction between
<em>metaphysical</em> and <em>methodological</em> <em>structuralism,
</em>which is drawn explicitly by Awodey (1996), will again be
helpful. Or rather, Awodey distinguishes between the use of category
theory as a framework for &ldquo;mathematical&rdquo; and for
&ldquo;philosophical structuralism&rdquo;. He describes mathematical
structuralism as a general way of &ldquo;pursuing a structural
approach to the subject&ldquo;, i.e., a style of practicing
mathematics that employs structural concepts and methods; and he
argues that category theory provides the <em>best way</em> of
capturing structuralist mathematics in this sense. However, he also
presents it as a framework for philosophical structuralism, i.e.,
&ldquo;an approach to the ontology and epistemology of
mathematics&rdquo;. Let us first consider the former suggestion and
argument.</p>

<p>
Category theory, understood as a branch of mathematics, had been
described as a &ldquo;general theory of mathematical structures&rdquo;
already earlier, e.g., by Mac Lane (1986, 1996). But what exactly is
meant by &ldquo;structure&rdquo; here? In connection with category
theory, it will help to clarify this issue further. At least two
relevant notions are mentioned in the literature concerning categorial
structuralism. First, a structure can be understood in the <em>set-
and model-theoretic sense</em>, which we can specify further as a
tuple consisting of a domain and an ordered sequence of relations,
functions, and distinguished elements used for the interpretation of a
formal language. (This is the notion of &ldquo;set-theoretic
relational system&rdquo; appealed to in earlier sections.) Such
structures are also called &ldquo;Bourbaki structures&rdquo; in this
context, because of Bourbaki&rsquo;s early reliance on set theory as
the framework. Their properties are usually defined axiomatically,
e.g., by the Dedekind-Peano axioms for arithmetic or by the group
axioms.</p>

<p>
Second and alternatively, there is a <em>categorical notion of
structure</em> based on the primitive concept of morphism between
mathematical objects as used in category theory. Typically, a category
consists of two types of entities, namely objects and morphisms
between them, in the sense of mappings represented by arrows that
preserve some of the internal structural composition of the objects at
issue. An axiom system that defines the general concept of a category,
along such lines, was first introduced by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in
their 1945 article. It describes a suitable composition operation on
arrows, its associativity, as well as the existence of an identity
morphism for each object (cf. Awodey 2010 for a textbook
presentation).</p>

<p>
Now, why might category theory be considered a <em>more adequate</em>
framework for a mathematical structuralism than other disciplines, in
particular traditional set theory? According to Awodey, the
&ldquo;Bourbaki notion of structure&rdquo; is a direct result of the
modern axiomatic tradition, from Dedekind and Hilbert to the Bourbaki
group. This tradition did introduce a structuralist
<em>perspective</em> on mathematics. Yet set theory is not an ideal
framework for capturing a structuralist understanding of mathematical
objects, as Awodey goes on to argue. To begin with, it is closely tied
to a model-theoretic conception of mathematical theories, including
the view that such theories study their models only &ldquo;up to
isomorphism&rdquo;. But according to Awodey, central to a
structuralist point of view is the principle (more on which below) to
<em>identify isomorphic objects</em>; and this principle is well
motivated from a category-theoretic viewpoint, but less so if
mathematical objects are constructed set-theoretically.</p>

<p>
A second advantage of category theory over set theory, also mentioned
by Awodey, is that the categorical notion of structure is <em>syntax
invariant</em>. That is to say, unlike in standard model theory the
categorical specification of objects in terms of their mapping
properties is independent of the choice of a particular signature used
for their description (a choice of basic relations, functions, and
distinguished elements). Third and most importantly, characteristic
for category theory is its focus on mappings between mathematical
objects that preserve (some of) their internal structure. Besides the
use of set-theory, it is the emphasis on <em>structure-preserving
mappings</em> that is often viewed as a central feature of
methodological structuralism, as we saw above already (see also again
Reck and Schiemer 2020a).</p>

<p>
Category theory was first worked out, against the background of these
developments, as a unifying framework for the study of the relations
between different mathematical structures (cf. Landry and Marquis
2005, Marquis 2009). Several types of mappings were introduced for
that task. One type involves the <em>morphisms</em> between objects of
the same category, e.g., group homomorphisms in the category of
groups, or linear maps in the category of vector spaces. Another
important type of mappings are <em>functors</em> between different
categories. (Roughly, a functor between two categories is a mapping of
objects to objects and arrows to arrows that preserves the categorical
properties in question.) It is such functors that are the crucial
tools in category theory for comparing the objects of different
mathematical categories, and thus, to &ldquo;relate structures of
different kinds&rdquo; (Awodey 1996). As such, they are central in
categorical structuralism. In particular, they allow for structuralist
understanding of an advanced kind.</p>

<h3 id="CatFouDebAboThe">4.2 Categorical Foundations and Debates About Them</h3>

<p>
As has been argued repeatedly along such lines, category theory
provides a more natural framework than traditional set theory for
mathematical or, as we prefer to call it, <em>methodological
structuralism</em> in mathematics. But what about its prospects as a
form of <em>philosophical</em> or <em>metaphysical</em> structuralism,
i.e., an alternative to the recent theories of Resnik, Shapiro, and
Hellman, or those of Nodelman and Zalta, Horsten, Leitgeb, etc.? We
already indicated that Awodey also presents it as such (cf. Awodey
1996); but this has led to ongoing controversies. A well-known article
by Hellmann (2003) contains a first critical discussion of
philosophical claims such as Awodey&rsquo;s. More specifically,
Hellman&rsquo;s piece raises several objections against the view that
category theory provides an adequate framework for a structuralist
account of mathematics in the philosophical sense, let along a better
such framework. As we will see, these objections are closely related
to the status of category theory as a <em>foundational</em>
discipline.</p>

<p>
In the last few years there has been much debate on which criteria a
theory has to meet in order to serve as a proper
&ldquo;foundation&rdquo; for mathematics. According to a helpful
proposal by Tsementzis, a <em>foundational system</em> consists of
three items: (i) a formal language; (ii) an axiomatic theory expressed
in that language; and (iii) a rich universe of objects, described by
the theory, in which all mathematical structures can be located,
represented, or encoded (cf. Tsementzis 2017). Zermelo-Fraenkel set
theory clearly represents a foundational system in this sense. The
axioms of ZFC are usually formulated in a formal first-order language;
and they describe a comprehensive universe, the cumulative hierarchy
of sets, in which mathematical objects such as number systems, groups,
rings, topological spaces, function spaces, etc. can be
represented.</p>

<p>
In research on category theory from the 1960s onward, after its
establishment as a fruitful <em>methodological</em> framework, several
axiomatizations of specific categories have been proposed as
<em>alternative foundations</em> for mathematics. This includes the
axiom systems describing the category of sets and functions, on the
one hand, and the category of categories, on the other hand (cf.
Lawvere 1964, 1966). Both were explicitly introduced as foundational
systems, and thus, as alternatives to Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
More recently, elementary topos theory has been developed as a form of
<em>categorical set theory, </em>which can serve as a foundational
system in the above sense as well (cf. Landry and Marquis 2005,
Marquis 2013).</p>

<p>
Returning to Hellman&rsquo;s 2003 challenge, the question of whether
category theory is usable to defend a version of philosophical
structuralism can then be directly related to the presumed
<em>autonomy</em> of these new approaches from traditional set theory.
Building on work by Solomon Feferman (especially Feferman 1977),
Hellman formulates two general objections. The first is the
<em>logical dependence objection</em> (cf. Linnebo &amp; Pettigrew
2011). Its core is the argument that category theory, general topos
theory, etc. are <em>not</em> autonomous of set theory in the end. The
reason given is that the axiomatic specification of categories and
topoi presupposes the concepts of operation, collection, and function,
and the latter need to be defined in a set theory such as ZFC.
Categorical foundations are therefore dependent on non-structural set
theory.</p>

<p>
The second argument against the autonomy of categorical foundations is
the <em>mismatch objection</em>. It concerns the general status of
category theory or topos theory; and it is based on the distinction
between two ways of understanding mathematical axioms: as
&ldquo;structural&rdquo;, &ldquo;algebraic&rdquo;,
&ldquo;schematic&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Hilbertian&rdquo;, on the one hand,
and as &ldquo;assertoric&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fregean&rdquo;, on the other
hand. As Hellman also argues, foundational systems need to be
<em>assertoric</em> in character, in the sense that their axioms
describe a comprehensive universe of objects used for the codification
of other mathematical structures. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is an
assertoric, &ldquo;contentual&rdquo; theory in that sense. Its axioms
(e.g., the power set axiom or the axiom of choice) make general
existence claims regarding the objects in the universe of sets.</p>

<p>
In contrast, category theory represents a branch of abstract algebra,
as its origin indicates. Thus it is, by its very nature,
<em>non-assertoric</em> in character; it lacks existence axioms
conceived as truths about an intended universe. For example, the
Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms of category theory are not &ldquo;basic
truths simpliciter&rdquo;, but &ldquo;schematic&rdquo; or
&ldquo;structural&rdquo;. They function as implicit definitions of
algebraic structures, similar to the way in which the axioms of group
theory or ring theory are &ldquo;defining conditions on types of
structures&rdquo;. This point is related to another argument against
the autonomy of category theory, the <em>problem of the home
address.</em> As Hellman asks, &ldquo;<em>w</em>here do categories
come from and where do they live?&rdquo; Given the
&ldquo;algebraic-structuralist perspective&rdquo; underlying category
theory and general topos theory, its axioms make <em>no
assertions</em> that particular categories or topoi actually
<em>exist</em>. Classical set theories, such as ZFC with its strong
existence axioms, have to step in again in order to secure the
existence of such objects.</p>

<p>
Hellman&rsquo;s and Feferman&rsquo;s arguments against the
foundational character of category theory have been examined from
various angles in the subsequent literature. One can distinguish
between two main types of responses, namely: (i) by proponents of
<em>categorical foundations</em>, who defend the autonomous character
of category theory relative to classical set theory; and (ii) by
<em>non-foundationalists</em>, who call into question that category
theory should be viewed as a foundational discipline. A series of
articles by McLarty represent the <em>first line of response</em> well
(cf. McLarty 2004, 2011, 2012). Roughly speaking, his reply to Hellman
is as follows: Whereas category theory and general topos theory did
originate as algebraic theories and are, as such, not feasible as
foundational systems, certain theories of particular categories and
toposes have been introduced as alternative foundations.
McLarty&rsquo;s central examples are Lawvere&rsquo;s axiomatizations
of the category of categories and his &ldquo;Elementary Theory of the
Category of Sets&rdquo; (ETCS).</p>

<p>
According to McLarty, these theories should be understood as
<em>assertoric</em> in Hellman&rsquo;s sense. That is to say, their
axioms are not merely implicit definitions, but general existential
claims about categories, sets, and functions. ETCS, for instance,
presents a function-based set theory, where sets and mappings between
them form a topos. In contrast to ZFC, with its primitive membership
relation, in ETCS a set is not specified via its internal composition,
but in terms of its mapping properties with respect to other sets,
formulated independently of ZFC. McLarty&rsquo;s response to the
objections mentioned above is, then, that categorical set theories
such as ETCS <em>do</em> provide a foundation for mathematics, one
that is logically <em>autonomous</em> from traditional set theories.
Moreover, given that mathematical structures can only be encoded in
ETCS as objects up to isomorphism, such categorical set theories
provide a <em>more adequate</em> foundation for modern structural
mathematics than ZFC. (We will return to this point below.)</p>

<p>
The second, quite different line of response to Hellman is provided by
Awodey (cf. Awodey 2004, earlier also Landry 1999). Awodey outlines a
category-theoretic form of structuralism that is decidedly
<em>anti-foundationalist</em>. He holds, in agreement with Hellman and
McLarty, that both the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms for category theory
and the axioms of general topos theory are schematic. But he then
argues that category theory in general does not, and should not be
taken to, provide a foundation for mathematics, either in a logical or
ontological sense. Rather, it presents a general and unifying
<em>language</em> for structural mathematics. He thus rejects
Hellman&rsquo;s assumption that the success of categorical
structuralism is dependent on whether category theory is usable as a
foundational enterprise or not.</p>

<p>
In fact, according to Awodey the central motivation for a
category-theoretic approach to mathematics is to <em>sidestep</em>
foundational issues concerning the nature of mathematical objects or
the study of a single comprehensive universe in which all structures
can be represented. While topos theory, say, might well serve as a
structural foundation for mathematics, for Awodey such a foundational
approach runs against the structuralist perspective embodied in
category-theory. In his own words, &ldquo;the idea of &lsquo;doing
mathematics categorically&rsquo; involves a different point of view
from the customary foundational one&rdquo; (Awodey 2004: 55). In light
of such fundamental, ongoing debates about categorical foundations for
mathematics, what are the implications for categorical structuralism
in the metaphysical sense, along Awodey&rsquo;s lines and more
generally? Or does it just amount to a form of methodological
structuralism, after all? We will conclude our discussion of
category-theoretic structuralism by addressing this question.</p>

<h3 id="PhiFeaCatTheStr">4.3 Philosophical Features of Category-Theoretic Structuralism</h3>

<p>
Beyond issues involving methodological structuralism (including
broadening and strengthening structuralist understanding in
mathematics), the literature on category-theoretic structuralism
during the last 25 years centers around two questions that have
already been mentioned. First, in what sense does category theory
provide a <em>framework</em> for philosophical or metaphysical
structuralism? Second, why is it supposed to be <em>better suited</em>
for that task than other frameworks, such as set theory,
Shapiro&rsquo;s structure theory, Hellman&rsquo;s modal structuralism,
etc.? In recent work on these topics, one can find three related
philosophical assumptions that characterize categorical structuralism
and distinguish it further from the versions of structuralism surveyed
earlier. We will treat each of them in turn, starting again with
Awodey&rsquo;s writings.</p>

<p>
A first characteristic assumption is that all mathematical theorems
are <em>schematic statements</em> that have a <em>conditional
form</em>. (This point is explicit in Awodey 2004.) We already saw
that according to Awodey a category-theoretic approach is
non-foundational in character. This includes that mathematical axioms
and theorems, as expressed in category theory, should be understood as
schematic statements. As such, they do not express truths about the
specific nature of mathematical objects. In addition, mathematical
theorems are, at least in principle, all of hypothetical form, i.e.,
they can be reconstructed as if-then statements. Note that this view
of the logical form of mathematical theorems is <em>prima facie</em>
similar to the if-then-ism one can find in Putnam&rsquo;s and
Hellman&rsquo;s works, building on Russell&rsquo;s earlier work.</p>

<p>
However, according to Awodey there is an important difference between
standard if-then-ism and a category-theoretic approach in terms of the
<em>ontological commitments</em> involved. According to standard
if-then-ism, any mathematical statement can be translated into a
universally quantified conditional statement, where the quantifiers
are meta-theoretic in nature, ranging over all set-theoretic systems
of the right type. (This is essentially what we called
&ldquo;universalist structuralism&rdquo; above.) As such, the approach
presupposes a rich ontology of sets. In contrast, along
category-theoretic lines mathematical theorems do not involve such
ontological commitments. There is no implicit generalization over the
set-theoretic structures of a theory. Rather, a mathematical theorem
is &ldquo;a <em>schematic</em> statement about a <em>structure</em>
[&hellip;] which can have various <em>instances</em>&rdquo; (Awodey
2004: 57). These instances remain undetermined on purpose, unless a
further specification of them is needed for the proof of a theorem in
question.</p>

<p>
A second distinctive feature of categorical structuralism, both for
Awodey and others, concerns a certain <em>top-down</em> conception of
mathematical objects characteristic for category theory. According to
standard set theory, mathematical objects are constructed from the
<em>bottom up</em>, in successive steps starting from some ground
level (the empty set or also a domain of urelements). Every object is
thus determined, as a set, in terms of its members. In contrast,
mathematical objects in category theory are characterized in a
top-down fashion, starting with the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms and
using the notion of morphism. Hence, the objects in a given category,
such as that of rings or topological spaces, are not considered
independently of the relevant morphisms. They are fully determined by
their mapping properties, as expressible in the language of category
theory. Nothing further is assumed about their inner constitution. In
particular, questions about their set-theoretic nature are considered
redundant (cf. Landry and Marquis 2005.)</p>

<p>
Third, arguably the most important feature of categorical
structuralism is that it verifies a version of the <em>structuralist
thesis</em> (hinted at earlier). Recall here Benacerraf&rsquo;s
argument, in his 1965 paper, that numbers should not be identified
with particular sets, but rather, with positions in an abstract
structure. Benacerraf also emphasizes that only certain properties are
relevant in arithmetic. For him, these are the number-theoretic
properties, such as &ldquo;being prime&rdquo; or &ldquo;being
even&rdquo;, that can be defined in terms of the primitive relations
and functions of the theory at issue. The general structuralist thesis
holds, then, that all (relevant) properties of the objects treated by
a mathematical theory should be <em>structural</em> in a specified
sense. (The question what &ldquo;structural&rdquo; means also came up
earlier.)</p>

<p>
Categorial structuralists typically argue that category theory
presents the <em>most adequate</em> framework for a structuralist
conception of mathematical objects, given that all the properties
expressible in its language turn out to be structural (cf. McLarty
1993, Awodey 2004, Marquis 2013). This is so, presumably, because the
category-theoretic study of mathematical objects, such as rings or
topological spaces, allows us to express just the right kind of
<em>structural information</em>, namely information about the
structural properties of these objects. In this context, structural
properties are usually characterized in terms of the notion of
<em>isomorphism invariance</em>. (Given a category <em>C</em>, a
morphism \(f: A \rightarrow B\) presents an isomorphism between
objects <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> if and only if there is a morphism
\(g: B \rightarrow A\) such that \(g \circ f = 1_A\) and \(f \circ g
=1_B\). A property <em>P</em> of an object <em>A</em> in category
<em>C</em> is then structural if it remains invariant under the
isomorphisms in <em>C</em>, that is, if \(P(A) \leftrightarrow
P(f(A))\), for all isomorphisms <em>f;</em> cf. Awodey 1996.)</p>

<p>
We saw above that the representation of mathematical objects in
traditional set theory (proceeding &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo;) brings
with it the possibility of expressing all sorts of properties about
their set-theoretical constitution that are <em>not isomorphism
invariant</em> in this sense. The central advantage of category theory
over traditional set theory (and similar approaches) is, according to
this argument, that such non-structural properties are simply ruled
out in the categorical framework. This point was first stressed in
McLarty&rsquo;s &ldquo;Numbers Can Be Just What They Have To&rdquo;
(1993), which, as its title suggests, is a rejoinder to Benacerraf
1965 article. McLarty&rsquo;s central thesis is that
Benacerraf&rsquo;s structuralist program is most successfully realized
if one considers numbers to be represented in categorical set theory,
such as in ETCS.</p>

<p>
To elaborate this point further, number systems of basic arithmetic
can be characterized in such categorical frameworks as &ldquo;natural
number objects&rdquo;, as was first shown by Lawvere. In contrast to
their ZFC-based representation, such objects are not just isomorphic
but share &ldquo;exactly the same properties&rdquo;, namely those
expressible in the language of the category of sets. In other words,
any two natural number objects are &ldquo;provably
indiscernible&rdquo; (McLarty 1993). Moreover, all of these properties
are structural in the above sense. As a consequence,
Benacerraf&rsquo;s dilemma of isomorphic numbers systems with
different set-theoretic properties does not arise in the context of
categorical set theory. The conclusion is that numbers can, after all,
be identified with sets, but with structural ones as defined in
ETCS.</p>

<p>
As McLarty and others went on to argue, this observation generalizes
from numbers to all other mathematical objects studied in category
theory. The claim is that any property of the objects in a given
category that is expressible in the language of category theory is
structural in the sense of being isomorphism invariant. The main
consequence for a structuralist conception of mathematical objects is
then summarized by Awodey as follows: &ldquo;Since all categorical
properties are thus structural, the only properties which a given
object in a given category may have, qua object in that category, are
structural ones&rdquo; (Awodey 1996: 214). This would seem to
illustrate a main advantage of categorical forms of structuralism over
set-theoretic and similar ones (but not over all forms of
structuralism considered earlier, as we can note).</p>

<p>
A rejoinder should be added, however. McLarty&rsquo;s and
Awodey&rsquo;s claim that all mathematical properties expressible in
categorical set theory are isomorphism invariant has been contested
(cf. Tsementzis 2017). In fact, it has become clear that neither ZFC
nor ETCS provide <em>fully structuralist</em> foundations for
mathematics, since their respective languages do not, after all,
exclusively allow for the formulation of invariant properties. Then
again, both Michael Makkai&rsquo;s FOLDS system (Makkai 1995, Other
Internet Resources, 1998) and the Univalent Foundations program
developed in Homotopy Type Theory (Univalent Foundations Program 2013)
seem to meet this condition. Here we have reached another ongoing
debate about mathematical structuralism in the literature, one that
partly depends on technical results.</p>

<p>
Debates like the one just mentioned are clearly relevant for us, but
we cannot explore them further here. (Cf. Awodey 2014 for more on the
relation between structuralism and Univalent Foundations.) Some
additional questions can be raised as well. For example, is
Awodey&rsquo;s position best understood as a deflationary form of
<em>metaphysical</em> structuralism; or does his anti-foundationalism
reduce category-theory to an advanced form of <em>methodological</em>
structuralism? On the <em>epistemological</em> side, in which ways
exactly does category theory involve new forms of structuralist
understanding (e.g., with the notion of functor)? However, we have to
reserve answering such questions again for future occasions. Instead,
we will conclude this survey with a few general remarks about
structuralism, also beyond the philosophy of mathematics.</p>

<h2 id="Con">5. Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="VarMatStr">5.1 Varieties of Mathematical Structuralism</h3>

<p>
In retrospect, we pursued two main goals in this survey. The first was
to provide an <em>introduction</em> to the discussions of
structuralism in contemporary philosophy of mathematics, usually
traced back to the 1960s. The second was to <em>broaden and
deepen</em> those discussions, by making clear that a much larger
variety of structuralist positions has played a role than is often
acknowledged. To be sure, some amount of variety was recognized
before, as reflected in Parsons&rsquo; distinction between
<em>eliminative</em> and <em>non-eliminative</em> positions, with
Shapiro&rsquo;s <em>ante rem</em> structuralism and Hellman&rsquo;s
modal structuralism as paradigms. Also, category-theoretic forms of
structuralism have been acknowledged as a third main alternative,
although their relationship to the others needed clarification. Yet
the range of positions at play encompasses much more than that,
including older variants, like set-theoretic structuralism, and
several more recent ones. Overall, &ldquo;mathematical
structuralism&rdquo; is not the name of a single position, but of a
<em>multifaceted family</em> of them.</p>

<p>
Three additional, more specific goals influenced the content and
overall shape of this survey further. First, while numerous variants
of structuralism for mathematics have been proposed, a number of of
them have not received adequate attention yet, including clarifying
their <em>relationships</em> to Shapiro&rsquo;s, Hellman&rsquo;s,
set-theoretic, and category-theoretic positions. Besides including
those variants explicitly, our discussion was meant to build
<em>bridges</em> and to provide <em>conceptual tools</em> for that
purpose. Second, several important forms of structuralism played a
role already <em>before the 1960s</em>, i.e., before the publications
by Benacerraf and Putnam with which debates about structuralism are
often assumed to have started. We wanted to make that evident as well
(and point the reader again to Reck &amp; Schiemer 2020a for more).
Third, this concerns both <em>metaphysical</em> and
<em>methodological</em> structuralism, a distinction we highlighted
repeatedly; it also leads to new questions about <em>structuralist
understanding</em>, which deserve more philosophical attention in
themselves.</p>

<h3 id="StrBeyMat">5.2 Structuralism Beyond Mathematics</h3>

<p>
If one widens one&rsquo;s perspective even further, it becomes clear
that another theme relevant for our discussion in a general way has
not been covered in this survey, although it should be mentioned at
least briefly before closing. This concerns debates about
&ldquo;structuralism&rdquo; <em>outside the philosophy of
mathematics</em>. There are two main areas in which one can find such
debates (each of which has had broader reverberations). The first is
the <em>philosophy of physics</em>, where structuralist positions have
played a significant role as well (including a position called
&ldquo;structural realism&rdquo;, which comes in both an
&ldquo;ontic&rdquo; and an &ldquo;epistemic&rdquo; form). The second
includes various parts of the <em>humanities and social sciences</em>,
primarily linguistics and anthropology, but also psychology,
sociology, etc. There too, &ldquo;structuralism&rdquo; (and
&ldquo;post-structuralism&rdquo;) has been a major topic, indeed
already for a relatively long time. In both cases there are systematic
and historical ties to mathematical structuralism, although sometimes
those ties are only loose.</p>

<p>
At a basic level, the debate about structuralism in the philosophy of
physics concerns how to think about the &ldquo;objects&rdquo; of
<em>modern physics</em>, given the revolutionary changes quantum
mechanics and relativity theory have brought about. More specifically,
it concerns the move to appeal to &ldquo;structures&rdquo; in this
connection, in a way that is closely related to the philosophy of
mathematics (cf. French 2014, Ladyman 2007 [2019], etc.). Second and
in addition, this debate concerns the question how to characterize
what, if anything, remains constant through <em>theory changes</em> in
the ontology of physics (cf. Worrall 1989, see also the
 <a href="../physics-structuralism/">entry on structuralism in physics</a>
 in this encyclopedia). Third, there are debates about
<em>scientific</em> <em>representation</em> that are related to
structuralism (cf. van Fraassen 2008). While one could pursue several
resulting points of contact further (e.g., concerning
&ldquo;structural indiscernibles&rdquo;, or versions of
&ldquo;set-theoretic vs. category-theoretic structuralism&rdquo; in
the context of physics), we refrain from doing so here.</p>

<p>
The structuralism introduced into <em>linguistics</em> by Ferdinand de
Saussure and Roman Jakobson, then adopted by various thinkers in the
humanities and social sciences&mdash;most prominently by Claude
Levi-Strauss in <em>anthropology</em> and by Jean Piaget in
<em>psychology</em> (cf. Levi-Strauss 1958 [1963], Piaget 1968 [1970],
also Caws 1988)&mdash;does have ties to mathematical structuralism as
well. But they are looser than in the case of the philosophy of
physics and there are more systematic differences. In particular, the
kind of <em>psychological</em> <em>determinism</em> that is often
associated, or even identified, with structuralism in the humanities
and social sciences (and criticized in post-structuralism) has no
analogue on the side of mathematics (or physics). Still, some striking
historical ties exist, e.g., personal contacts between Levi-Strauss
and members of the Bourbaki group (cf. Dosse 1991&ndash;92 [1997]).
Those ties might be worth exploring further too, at least if one wants
to understand the role of structuralist ideas in human thought more
fully.</p>
