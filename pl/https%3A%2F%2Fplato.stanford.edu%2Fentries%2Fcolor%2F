Colors are of philosophical interest for a number of reasons. One of
the most important reasons is that color raises serious metaphysical
issues, concerning the nature both of physical reality and of the
mind. Among these issues are questions concerning whether color is
part of a mind-independent reality, and what account we can give of
experiences of color. These issues have been, and continue to be,
inextricably linked with important epistemological and semantic
issues.</p>

<h2 id="PhiCol">1. The Philosophy of Color</h2>

<p>
In this section, we consider some central puzzles that arise in the
philosophy of color, concerning the nature of colors and how they fit
into scientific accounts of the world.</p>

<h3 id="ProCol">1.1 A Problem with Color</h3>

<p>
The visual world, the world as we see it, is a world populated by
colored objects. Typically, we see the world as having a rich tapestry
of colors or colored forms&mdash;fields, mountains, oceans, skies,
hairstyles, clothing, fruit, plants, animals, buildings, and so on.
Colors are important in both identifying objects, i.e., in locating
them in space, and in re-identifying them. So much of our perception
of physical things involves our identifying objects by their
appearance, and colors are typically essential to an object&rsquo;s
appearance, that any account of visual perception must contain some
account of colors. Since visual perception is one of the most
important species of perception and hence of our acquisition of
knowledge of the physical world, and of our environment, including our
own bodies, a theory of color is doubly important.</p>

<p>
One of the major problems with color has to do with fitting what we
seem to know about colors into what science (not only physics but the
science of color vision) tells us about physical bodies and their
qualities. It is this problem that historically has led the major
physicists who have thought about color, to hold the view that
physical objects do not actually have the colors we ordinarily and
naturally take objects to possess. Oceans and skies are not blue in
the way that we naively think, nor are apples red (nor green). Colors
of that kind, it is believed, have no place in the physical account of
the world that has developed from the sixteenth century to this
century.</p>

<p>
Not only does the scientific mainstream tradition conflict with the
common-sense understanding of color in this way, but as well, the
scientific tradition contains a very counter-intuitive conception of
color. There is, to illustrate, the celebrated remark by David
Hume:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Sounds, colors, heat and cold, according to modern philosophy are not
qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind. (Hume 1738: Bk III,
part I, Sect. 1 [1911: 177]; Bk I, IV, IV [1911: 216])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Physicists who have subscribed to this doctrine include the
luminaries: Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, Newton, Thomas Young, Maxwell
and Hermann von Helmholtz. Maxwell, for example, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It seems almost a truism to say that color is a sensation; and yet
Young, by honestly recognizing this elementary truth, established the
first consistent theory of color. (Maxwell 1871: 13 [1970: 75])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This combination of eliminativism&mdash;the view that physical objects
do not have colors, at least in a crucial sense&mdash;and
subjectivism&mdash;the view that color is a subjective
quality&mdash;is not merely of historical interest. It is held by many
contemporary experts and authorities on color, e.g., Zeki 1983, Land
1983, and Kuehni 1997. Palmer, a leading psychologist and cognitive
scientist, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
People universally believe that objects look colored because they are
colored, just as we experience them. The sky looks blue because it is
blue, grass looks green because it is green, and blood looks red
because it is red. As surprising as it may seem, these beliefs are
fundamentally mistaken. Neither objects nor lights are actually
&ldquo;colored&rdquo; in anything like the way we experience them.
Rather, color is a psychological property of our visual experiences
when we look at objects and lights, not a physical property of those
objects or lights. The colors we see are based on physical properties
of objects and lights that cause us to see them as colored, to be
sure, but these physical properties are different in important ways
from the colors we perceive. (Palmer 1999: 95)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This quote, however, needs unpacking. Palmer is obviously challenging
our ordinary common-sense beliefs about colors. Specifically, he is
denying that objects and lights have colors in the sense of
<em>colors-as-we-experience-them</em> (or <em>colors as we see
them</em>). As far as this goes, it is compatible with objects and
lights having colors in some other sense, e.g., colors, as defined for
scientific purposes. Secondly, he is saying that color (i.e.,
<em>color-as-we-experience it</em>) is a psychological property, which
in turn, might be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the view
is quite complex (see the next section). If we examine the writings of
others in the scientific tradition, we find that their views are also
complex. The view maybe color-eliminativism, but it is not merely
that.</p>

<h3 id="ResEli">1.2 Resistance to Eliminativism/Subjectivism</h3>

<p>
There has been a strong resistance among philosophers, both to the
Eliminativist tendency within the scientific tradition, and the
related subjectivism. One form this resistance takes reflects the fact
that each component of this traditional view is very puzzling. A
common response is to say that our color terms&mdash;red, blue,
purple, orange, yellow, green, brown, etc.&mdash;are in order: we have
paradigms of colors to which the color terms apply: ripe lemons are
yellow, tomatoes and rubies are red, and so on. We have no trouble, by
and large, in learning these terms and teaching them in ostensive
practices to children and others. In the second place, it is hard to
make sense of the claim that colors are properties of sensations or
are psychological properties: if they are anything they are properties
of material objects and light sources&mdash;of peaches, and emeralds,
of skies, of rainbows, of glasses of wine, of headlamps, and so
on.</p>

<p>
It should be noted, however, that things are more complex than the
earlier remarks of Hume and Maxwell suggest. Descartes and Locke, for
example, think that there are no colors in the physical world&mdash;no
colors, as we ordinarily and naively understand them to be. But they
are also widely interpreted as holding a secondary quality view of
colors, i.e., holding the view that colors are powers or dispositions
to cause experiences of a certain type. It is instructive to try to
understand this dual position. We find, for example, this passage in
Descartes&rsquo; <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is clear then that when we say we perceive colors in objects,
<em>it is really just the same as saying</em> that we perceived in
objects something as to whose nature we are ignorant but which
produces in us a very clear and vivid sensation, what we call the
sensation of color. (Descartes 1644 [1988]: para. 70; see also paras
68&ndash;70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The implication of &ldquo;it is really just the same as saying&rdquo;
is that this is not what it is ordinarily taken to be saying. As
Descartes later explains, the ordinary way involves the mistake of
&ldquo;judging that the feature of objects that we call
&lsquo;color&rsquo; is something &lsquo;just like the color in our
sensation&rsquo;&rdquo;. However, Descartes is not implying that we
should dispense with our ordinary talk. Instead, it is being
suggested, we should go on using our ordinary color talk, but give it
a novel interpretation: when we say &ldquo;<em>X</em>&rdquo;, then it
is as though we said &ldquo;<em>Y</em>&rdquo;. That is to say, we
should not understand the sentences literally, but rather translate
them into other more appropriate sentences. Descartes, here, is
following the principle common to many thinkers of the time, the
principle of &ldquo;talking with vulgar, and thinking with the
learned&rdquo;. The justification for this proposal is that it
acknowledges that our color language serves very useful purposes: the
reconstruction allows the language to continue to serve those
purposes, while avoiding metaphysical error. Thus, there is at least a
partial response to the common-sense criticism: the reconstruction
central to this form of eliminativism embraces a principle of respect
for our ordinary language.</p>

<p>
There are also complications with respect to the subjectivist
component of the traditional view. When philosophers such as Descartes
and Locke wrote of sensations of color, or of (sensory) ideas of
color, there are different interpretations of what is meant by the
terms. The common interpretation is that a sensation of red is a
sensory experience in which a certain subjective quality is presented.
Expressed in modern terms, the subjective qualities are construed as
qualia, or as qualities of sensory individuals such as sensa or
sense-data or as sensational properties. There is, however, an
alternative interpretation: a sensation of color is a sensory
experience, which represents something as having a certain quality
(the experience has a certain intentional content). On this second
interpretation, Descartes&rsquo; view would be that the relevant
quality our color experience represents objects as having is one that
no object possesses. Accordingly, it would not be inappropriate to
call the theory &ldquo;fictionalist&rdquo; rather than
subjectivist.(For discussion of Color Fictionalism, see Gatzia 2008
[2015]). This interpretation, we should note, allows for qualia or
sensa, but does not mandate them. And some Cartesian scholars deny
that Descartes, in particular, was committed to qualia.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is yet another complication. It is in fact possible to
combine the two versions in a single interpretation. That is to say,
the representationalist view does not rule out a version with
subjectivist elements. For such a view allows for a type of
projectivism, whereby the experience both presents a sensory quality,
and represents a physical object as having that quality. The
experience is said to &ldquo;project&rdquo; the subjective, sensory
qualities onto the physical objects. A model for this would be the
experience of pain: the supposition is that when one has a toothache,
the experience represents the pain as being in the tooth. (This
projectivist view seems to suit Hume&rsquo;s thought, but in any case,
it fits modern projectivist accounts.)</p>

<p>
We might note the it is common to find, in authoritative texts,
definitions like</p>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;Color attributes are attributes of visual sensations, e.g.,
hue, saturation and brightness&rdquo;;</li>

<li>&ldquo;hue: attribute of color perception denoted by the terms
yellow, red, blue, green and so forth&rdquo;;</li>

<li>&ldquo;Brightness is the attribute of a visual sensation according
to which a given visual stimulus appears to be more or less
intense&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is a range of ways we might interpret these definitions:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Color attributes are:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>attributes of sensations;</li>

<li>attributes presented in sensations;</li>

<li>attributes sensations represent objects as having.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Several of these ways understanding the definitions leave it open
whether physical objects actually have the attributes or not, and
whether the attributes (that form part of the representational content
of the experiences) might have subjective components.</p>

<p>
Finally, we should note that part of the explanation for the
resistance to Color Eliminativism is that it is not widely
acknowledged that the theory takes different forms. More accurately,
the thesis can be combined with different other theses, which have the
result of making the theory more positive than it sounds on first
hearing. Some forms of the theory are better thought of as being Color
Fictionalism. Not only does the title suggest something positive; it
implies that there is something worth preserving in our ordinary
conceptual practices concerting colors&mdash;the way we ordinarily
talk and think about colors&mdash;but it follows through on the
promise. With respect to a vast number of ordinary color sentences, it
implies that we should adopt a certain attitude: we should make
believe the sentences are true. (See Gatzia 2008 [2015] for strong
defences of Color Fictionalism). We shall return to this theme in
 <a href="#ColEli">Section 2.3</a>,
 below</p>

<h3 id="ProColRea">1.3 The Problem of Color Realism</h3>

<p>
From our discussion of the scientific tradition on colors, it is clear
(enough) that two questions face us:</p>

<ol>

<li>What is the right account of colors-as-we-experience-them? of
colors-as-we-see-them? colors-as-we-ordinarily-talk-and-think of
them?</li>

<li>Are there such colors?</li>
</ol>

<p>
For obvious reasons, these questions present us with what we might
call &ldquo;the Problem of Color Realism&rdquo;. The discussion also
indicates that finding answers may be a little tricky. (We should also
note that there are complexities associated with our understanding of
<em>Realism</em>, that we will need to slide over&mdash;see the entry
on
 <a href="../realism/">realism</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Let us turn to a more recent description of the problem. Byrne and
Hilbert (2003) say, of the problem of color realism, that it
&ldquo;concerns various especially salient properties that objects
visually appear to have&rdquo;. By way of clarification, they say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If someone with normal color vision looks at a tomato in good light,
the tomato will appear to have a distinctive property&mdash;a property
that strawberries and cherries also appear to have, and which we call
&ldquo;red&rdquo; in English. The problem of color realism is posed by
the following two questions. First, do objects like tomatoes,
strawberries and radishes really have the distinctive property that
they do appear to have? Second, what is this property? (Byrne &amp;
Hilbert 2003: 3&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It would seem that Byrne and Hilbert give us another
expression&mdash;&ldquo;the color things appear to be&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the color things look to have&rdquo;&mdash;to go with our
earlier expressions, &ldquo;colors-as-we-experience-them&rdquo;,
&ldquo;colors as-we-see-them&rdquo;. (As we shall see, with each
expression, there is an ambiguity which will need to be taken care
with, but, it would seem, the same ambiguity applies to each
expression.)</p>

<p>
The use of the expression&ldquo;colors-as-we-see-them&rdquo; has
certain advantages, in that it brings out certain important features
of colors. The first is that it implies that a comprehensive account
of color is going to depend on an account of perceptual experience.
Given the controversies on that topic, it is likely to mean that
similar disputes will spill over to the subject of color. For example,
on some views, colors-as-we-see-them will be certain properties
presented in experience. According to other views, they will be
certain properties that material things are represented as having. On
a third view, Color Projectivism, the qualities presented in visual
experiences are subjective qualities, which are
&ldquo;projected&rdquo; on to material objects: the experiences
represent material objects as having the subjective qualities. Those
qualities are taken by the perceiver to be qualities instantiated on
the surfaces of material objects&mdash;the perceiver does not
ordinarily think of them as subjective qualities. (For the moment we
are thinking of colors of material sources. The account can be
extended so as to apply to film colors and colors of light
sources.)</p>

<p>
Deciding the questions with which we began, in this Section, will
depend on theories of representational content (intentional content)
perceptual experiences carry; see the entry on
 <a href="../perception-problem/">the problem of perception</a>.
 Some important readings that delve, extensively, into these areas are
Byrne &amp; Hilbert 1997c; Shoemaker 1994 [1997]; Chalmers 2006.</p>

<h3 id="ColWeOrdTalThiAboThe">1.4 Colors as We Ordinarily Talk and Think About Them</h3>

<p>
It is commonplace for color theorists to introduce their study by
reference to the color terms used in everyday common language,
e.g.,&ldquo;red&rdquo; and &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; and
&ldquo;green&rdquo; and &ldquo;blue&rdquo;. For example, Hardin, in
his highly influential book, <em>Color for Philosophers</em> (1988
[1993] writes):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What&rsquo;s essential to chromatic phenomena, and what&rsquo;s
accidental? What might we safely dispense with? Rather than
undertaking to identify, characterize and then sort through all of the
folk notions of color, I shall say what it is that I have in mind when
I think and talk about colors. Primarily, what I have in mind are red
and yellow and green and blue, though I am also inclined to include
white and black and gray as well, along, perhaps, with a special place
for brown. (Hardin 1993: xx)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Byrne and Hilbert, when they introduce the problem of color realism,
say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If someone with normal color vision looks at a tomato in good light,
the tomato will appear to have a distinctive property&mdash;a property
that strawberries and cherries also appear to have, and which we call
&ldquo;red&rdquo; in English. (Byrne &amp; Hilbert 2003:
3&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
They then characterize the problem of color realism as posed by the
following two questions. First, do objects like tomatoes, strawberries
and radishes really have the distinctive property that they do appear
to have <em>[and which we call &ldquo;red&rdquo; in English]</em>?
Second, what is this property</p>

<p>
It will be noted that I have re-instated their characterization of the
property as &ldquo;one that we call &lsquo;red&rsquo; in
English&rdquo;. The point is that we need this clause to identify the
property in question. So, among other things, the enquiry is directed
at uncovering the property which our ordinary color terms, such as
&ldquo;red&rdquo;, designate.</p>

<p>
It is no accident that theorists proceed in this way. As defenders of
a naive realist theory of color note, there is a well-established set
of conceptual and linguistic practices which imply everyday concepts
of color, a set of practicees which, by and large, is quite
successful, even flourishing. Given this fact, an important issue
arises: does color realism apply to these concepts of color? The
upshot is that it is hard to see how we can avoid questions concerning
how our color terms are ordinarily used and understood.</p>

<p>
One important approach to answering the questions is that followed by
Johnston, in a highly influential paper (Johnston 1992). In that
paper, he implicitly acknowledges the existence of a set of linguistic
and conceptual practices that underpin what might be called &ldquo;our
ordinary thinking about color&rdquo;. This thinking is not meant to
comprise theoretical thinking or theorizing about color, or at least,
it is much more than that. It comprises our thinking and talking that
involves our exercise of concepts of color. Johnston asks the question
of which principles such thinking about color must consist in, in
order to count as exercising those concepts of color.</p>

<p>
Johnston says that the ordinary concept of color is a &ldquo;cluster
concept&rdquo;, which incorporates a wide set of beliefs. There are,
he points out, many beliefs about color to which we are susceptible,
beliefs resulting from our visual experience and our tendency to take
that visual experience in certain ways. Johnston says that some of
these beliefs are &ldquo;core&rdquo; beliefs, which we can contrast
with the more &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; beliefs. The point about the
core beliefs is this: were such beliefs to turn out not to be true, we
would then have trouble saying what they were false of, i.e., we would
be deprived of a subject matter, rather than having our views changed
about a given subject matter. By contrast, the peripheral beliefs are
such that &ldquo;as they change we are simply changing our mind about
a stable subject matter&rdquo; (Johnston 1992 [1997: 137]).</p>

<p>
Taking canary yellow as an illustrative example, he writes that
beliefs with a legitimate title to be included in a core of beliefs
about canary yellow include:</p>

<ol id="belieflist">

<li id="beliefparadigms"><em>Paradigms</em>. Some of what we take to
be paradigms of canary yellow things (e.g., some canaries) are canary
yellow.</li>

<li id="beliefexplanationa"><em>Explanation</em>. The fact of a
surface or volume or radiant source being canary yellow sometimes
causally explains our visual experience as of canary yellow
things.</li>

<li id="beliefunity"><em>Unity</em>. Thanks to its nature and the
nature of the other determinate shades, canary yellow has its own
unique place in the network of similarity, difference and exclusion
relations exhibited by the whole family of shades.</li>

<li><em>Perceptual Availability</em>. Justified belief about the
canary yellowness of external things is available simply on the basis
of visual perception. That is, if external things are canary yellow we
are justified in believing this just on the basis of visual perception
and the beliefs, which typically inform it.</li>

<li id="beliefrevelation"><em>Revelation</em>. The intrinsic nature of
canary yellow is fully revealed by a standard visual experience as of
a canary yellow thing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Canary yellow is an example. More generally, for each color property
<em>F</em>, beliefs that are legitimately included in the core of
beliefs concerning <em>F</em>, will include the relevant instances of
the
 <a href="#belieflist">beliefs (1) to (5)</a>.
 Johnston goes on to argue that in fact there are no properties for
which all of these beliefs hold true. Accordingly, &ldquo;speaking
ever so inclusively&rdquo;, the world is not colored. However, he
maintains, &ldquo;speaking more or less inclusively&rdquo;, the world
is colored, for there are properties which make true enough of these
beliefs, so as to deserve to be called colors. Johnston then goes on
to defend the view that the closest candidates for the various colors
are the dispositional properties, dispositions to look yellow, to look
blue, etc. The item in the list that provides most trouble is
 <a href="#beliefrevelation">item (5)</a>
 the doctrine of Revelation. To drop this from the list, he thinks, is
a price worth paying, to preserve that claim that there really are
colors.</p>

<p>
However, when we look at the items of Johnston&rsquo;s list, it seems
difficult to maintain this view about the status of the various items.
Take
 <a href="#beliefrevelation">item (5)</a>,
 Revelation. Whatever its status, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a folk
belief. It looks more like something a philosopher might come up with.
In the second place, it seems to have a peculiar status. Experiences
of color, it is claimed, are enough to inform us of the nature of
color. If it is true or if it is a folk belief, it is hard to see what
need there is of the other items in the list. Perhaps, though, this
formulation of the doctrine is misleading, and there is a better
formulation available. One possibility is that the doctrine should be
interpreted as addressing certain necessary conditions, rather than
all necessary conditions, or all necessary and sufficient conditions.
This point is important since there is group of philosophers who are
sympathetic to Primitivism and/or Na&iuml;ve Realism, who seem to
favor a principle that differs in this way from Johnston&rsquo;s
formulation
 (<a href="#PriSimObjVieCol">see section 2.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Let us concentrate on
 <a href="#beliefunity">item, (3),</a>
 which Johnston labels &ldquo;Unity&rdquo;. What it points to is the
fact that the various colors can be ordered systematically, in a
structured array of all the colors, where that array is based on the
system of relations of similarity, difference and exclusion holding
among the colors. The color &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; is said to have a
highly distinctive place in this array. Johnston explains the
principle in more detail:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Think of the relations exemplified along the axes of hue, saturation
and brightness in the so-called color solid. The color solid captures
central facts about the colors, e.g., that canary yellow is not as
similar to the shades of blue as they are similar among themselves,
i.e., that canary yellow is not a shade of blue. (Johnston 1992 [1997:
138])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is little doubt that this is an important principle, one which
plays a central part in the reasoning of many philosophers who have
written on color, e.g., Wittgenstein 1977; Harrison 1973; Hardin 1988
[1993], 2003; Thompson 1995; Maund 1995. It is regarded as an
important factor which physicalist-realist theories of color must
explain, and have a problem in explaining.</p>

<p>
However, whatever the status of this principle, it is not a folk
belief (and few of these last-mentioned theorists say that it is). Nor
is it plausibly a tacit belief. For example, it does not seem a belief
it is necessary to have, in order to have mastery of concepts of color
and, in particular, of a concept of yellow. It is surely quite a
sophisticated belief, which requires considerable experience with
colors. For one thing, the dimensions mentioned by Johnston&mdash;hue,
saturation and brightness&mdash;apply to aperture colors or film
colors, which few folk would be aware of, and not to surface colors.
Aperture colors are colors perceived under a special mode of viewing:
one views the objects or light sources through a small aperture in a
screen (of an achromatic color). The appearance of these colors
differs from that of colors seen under more usual circumstances.
&ldquo;Surface colors&rdquo; are the colors of illuminated samples
seen under conditions in which it is possible for the viewer to
distinguish the color of the surface from that of the ambient light.
Indeed, for surface colors, there are two sets of dimensions: hue,
chroma, and lightness (the Munsell system) and hue, chromaticness and
whiteness/blackness (the Swedish Natural Color system, NCS).
Nevertheless, Unity (or a set of Unities) is an important principle
and it has something to do with our concepts of color. Wittgenstein,
for example, thought it was central to our having the concepts of
color that we do, but he says that &ldquo;we do not want to find a
theory of color &hellip; but rather the logic of color concepts&rdquo;
(Wittgenstein 1977: 43e). (We are touching on deep issues of
philosophical methodology, which we are not going to settle here; see
the entry on
 <a href="../analysis/">analysis</a>,
 which, interestingly, discusses Jackson&rsquo;s analysis of color.)
On this topic, of a framework for ordering colors, we might note the
work of theorists who describe color order systems. One major figure
is Kuehni; see, in particular, his paper, &ldquo;Color Spaces and
Color Order Systems&rdquo;, in Cohen &amp; Matthen 2010. Another is
Briggs (2020): &ldquo;Color Spaces&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
A useful way of thinking of the methodology for the philosophy of
color is that given by D. Hilbert in an early work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he question of the objectivity of color is in the end a conceptual
one. To settle the question, we need to discover which way of
conceptualising color allows us to account for both pre-theoretical
intuitions regarding color and the wide range of known color
phenomena. (Hilbert 1987: 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This view seems to accommodate a modified version of Johnston&rsquo;s
approach. It also allows the possibility that a theorist might defend
a theory of color by rejecting some of the &ldquo;pre-reflective
intuitions&rdquo;, while explaining why those intuitions might be
held. A recent work that addresses some these issues is Z.Adams 2016.
Adams argues that the modern debate between certain
color-eliminativists and Oxford color-dispositionalists is affected by
the fact that members of each side are guided by different
color-intuitions, ones that have historical sources. One does not have
to agree fully with Adams to appreciate that he raises a serious issue
for thought about the metaphysics of color.</p>

<p>
In a more recent article, Adams&mdash;with Hansen&mdash;returns to the
topic (Adams &amp; Hansen 2020). They discusses a series of
experiments in which experimenters attempted to ascertain the views on
colors held by large groups of subjects. More accurately, the
experimenters wished to find out whether the subjects held a
relationalist view of color or, alternatively, an intrinsic property
view. Interestingly, they find subjects to be divided, roughly
equally. As a result, Adams and Hansen draw the conclusion that the
very notion of &ldquo;the ordinary conception of color is a
myth&rdquo;. The topic is certainly interesting, but it may be
premature to draw the conclusion that Adams and Hansen draw.</p>

<p>
The issues raised in this section involve complex issues of
philosophical methodology, about which there is much contemporary
dispute. No short discussion of such issues can hope to be
comprehensive. Different philosophers hold sharply differing views
about both the nature of conceptual analysis and its significance.
Part of the aim of this section was to bring out that the practice of
different groups of philosophers is closer than one would expect from
their official views. (For further discussion, see the entries on
 <a href="../analysis/">analysis</a>
 and
 <a href="../concepts/">concepts</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
In this section, we have discussed &ldquo;the ways we ordinarily talk
and think about colors.&rdquo; There are important topics and
questions that we have set to one side. There are important questions
about whether, and to what extent, culture affects our thought and
language about colors, e.g., our color-naming practices, as well as
our perception of colors. It does seem that we categorize colors in
certain ways, and there is an important question as to whether there
is some universalist structure to these categories. General overviews
of the topic and questions are provided by Briscoe (2020) and Dedrick
(2020). At they both point out, there has been, in Philosophy,
Anthropology, and Linguistics, a long-standing debate on the merits,
or otherwise, of &ldquo;universalist&rdquo; and
&ldquo;relativist&rdquo; claims. While that debate seems at various
times to be quite intense, it seems that, more recently, both sides
have come to qualify their positions in important ways (see Briscoe
2020). Much of this debate considers empirical findings and their
interpretation, thee is also the question to be considered is to what
extent do these empirical findings affect philosophical debates
between various philosophical accounts of color: realists,
eliminativists and subjectivists. A good guide on such matters is
Hardin (2005).</p>

<h3 id="TaxRivTheCol">1.5 Taxonomy of Rival Theories of Color</h3>

<p>
As we saw above, there are two issues concerning color realism:</p>

<ul>

<li>what sort of properties are colors?</li>

<li>do objects really possess those properties?</li>
</ul>

<p>
With respect to the first issue, there is deep division between
different color realists (as well as between them and eliminativists).
Setting out the views of major realists and eliminativists, we have
the following major rival categories:</p>

<ol>

<li>Colors are &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;
properties&mdash;simple, <em>sui generis</em>, qualitative properties
that physical bodies possess or appear to
possess: <em>Primitivism</em>. It is important to note
that <em>Primitivism</em> comes in very different forms: <em>Realist
Primitivism</em> and <em>Eliminativist Primitivism</em></li>

<li>Colors are &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; properties of
bodies&mdash;complex, physical properties that dispose bodies to look
blue, pink, yellow, etc.: <em>Reductive Physicalism</em></li>

<li>Colors are perceiver-dependent, dispositional
properties&mdash;powers to look in distinctive ways to appropriate
perceivers, in appropriate circumstances:
<em>Dispositionalism</em></li>

<li>Colors are subjective qualities &ldquo;projected&rdquo; onto
physical objects and light-sources&mdash;qualities which visual
experiences represent objects as having: <em>Projectivism</em>.</li>

<li>Colors are subjective qualities&mdash;either qualities presented
in experience or qualities of experiences: <em>Subjectivism</em>.</li>

<li>Colors are &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; properties: physical and
phenomenological.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note:</p>

<ol>

<li>Questions can be asked about the framework set out above, which
compares different theories. Like many taxonomies, there may well be
strong arguments that one or other item comes in different forms which
should be acknowledged. For an astute discussion of some of these
issues, see Robinson 2020: &ldquo;Mentalist Approaches to
Color&rdquo;.</li>

<li>Theories in category 3 are relational theories of color.
Historically, they have been interpreted in terms of normal/standard
observers, and standard viewing conditions. Recently there have
developed versions of the theory which relax these requirements.</li>

<li>This taxonomy is a first approximation. Some theorists would hold
that there is more than one kind of color: dual referent theorists,
e.g., Descartes 1644; D.H. Brown 2006.</li>

<li>Subjectivist theories come in different forms: (i) dualist
subjectivism, according to which subjective qualities are irreducible
to physical properties; (ii) subjectivist theories which allow the
possibility that the subjective qualities are identical to physical
properties, e.g., those of the brain. For more detailed discussion of
these issues, see Robinson 2020.</li>

<h2 id="TheCol">2. Theories of Color</h2>

<p>
In <a href="#TaxRivTheCol">Section 1.5</a> above,
 the major rival theories of color were set out. They comprise
varieties of color realism and color eliminativism/fictionalism. In
this section, we will examine specific versions of these theories.
Many of the general issues that have been touched upon will come up
for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="PriSimObjVieCol">2.1 Primitivism: The Simple Objectivist View of Colors</h3>

<p>
One of the most prominent views of color is that color is an
objective, i.e., mind-independent, intrinsic property, one possessed
by many material objects (of different kinds) and light sources. (By
&ldquo;objective&rdquo; here, I mean &ldquo;ontologically
objective&rdquo;, i.e., mind-independent&mdash;see Searle 2015: 16.)
This view, call it <em>Color Objectivism</em>, takes different forms,
however. One form it takes is that colors are simple qualities, which
show their natures on their face: they are <em>sui generis</em>,
simple, qualitative, sensuous, intrinsic, irreducible properties.This
view has come to be called &ldquo;Color Primitivism&rdquo;. Another
common form is that colors are objective (mind-independent),
properties of material bodies and light sources, whose natures are
&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; from us, and require empirical investigation to
discover. I shall use the terms &ldquo;Reductive Color
Physicalism&rdquo; or &ldquo;Color Physicalism&rdquo;, for short, to
refer to it. (See
 <a href="#RedColPhy">Section 2.2</a>
 for discussion of this thesis.)</p>

<p>
Color Primitivism comes in two forms: a realist version and an
eliminativist version. Realist Color Primitivism is the view that
there are in nature colors, of a distinctive kind that we are all
familiar with, i.e., that colors are simple intrinsic, non-relational,
non-reducible, qualitative properties. They are qualitative features
of the sort that stand in the characteristic relations of similarity
and difference that mark the colors; they are not micro-structural
properties or reflectances, or anything of the sort. There is no
radical illusion, error or mistake in color perception (only
commonplace illusions): we perceive objects to have the colors that
they really have. Such a view has been presented by Hacker (1987) and
by J. Campbell (1993, 2005) and has become increasingly popular:
McGinn (1996); Watkins (2005); Gert (2006, 2008, 2017); Allen (2011,
2015, 2016). This view is sometimes called &ldquo;The Simple View of
Color&rdquo; and sometimes &ldquo;A Na&iuml;ve Realist view of
Color&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Realist Color Primitivism may be thought of as containing a conceptual
(and semantic) thesis about our ordinary understanding of color, and a
metaphysical thesis, namely, that physical bodies actually have colors
of this sort. It is possible to accept the conceptual thesis but deny
the metaphysical thesis. This gives us an eliminativist form of Color
Primitivism. (In this section, we will concentrate on Primitivist
Realism, and leave discussion of the Eliminativist form until
 <a href="#ColEli">Section 2.3</a>.)
 (We should note that Allen who defends what he calls &ldquo;A
Na&iuml;ve Realist Theory of Colour&rdquo; rejects the practice of
thinking of different versions of Primitivism, as Realist and as
Eliminativist versions. He thinks it is misleading and unhelpful.)</p>

<p>
One major criticism with Primitivism concerns whether the arguments
for it depends on a questionable form of the doctrine of
<em>Revelation</em>. (See Byrne &amp; Hilbert 2007a, for an expression
of this criticism, among a set of other criticisms.) In response, many
authors argue that the form of Revelation set out by Johnston is too
strong, and there is a more moderate form of the doctrine that is more
plausible (see Campbell 2005; Gert 2008; Allen 2011). It is worth
noting that while Johnston and others cite Bertrand Russell and Galen
Strawson as advocates of the doctrine, these two authors actually say
very different things, in the quotes given to illustrate the doctrine.
Russell, for example, places stress on the perceiver being acquainted
with instances of color.</p>

<p>
One of the major problems, historically, with Realist Primitivism,
concerns whether the putative intrinsic color features can be thought
of as having a causal role in our experiences of colors. The
properties that do the causing of these experiences seem to be
complex, micro-structural properties of surfaces of bodies (and
similar properties for seeing volume colors, diffraction colors,
scattering colors, etc). This problem is addressed by Hacker in his
defense of the claim that colors are intrinsic features of physical
bodies. He insists that colors are properties that are used to provide
causal explanations. There is no more reason to deny this, he says,
than there is to deny the parallel claim for solidity and liquidity.
So, the explanation is not vitiated by the discovery that
microstructural processes are involved, any more than explanations
concerning solidity and liquidity are rendered otiose by the discovery
of the microstructural base for these properties. A possible criticism
of this analogy would be that, in the case of solidity and liquidity,
it is plausible to analyze these properties functionally: to be solid
is to have some structure that is the causal basis for such and such
ways of behaving. This is not the sort of analysis that the
Primitivist requires (see also Campbell 1993). One might also point
out an important difference between the two situations. In the case of
liquidity and solidity, the theory does explain why liquids have their
characteristic form, rather than that of solids and gases. There is no
parallel explanation in the case of reflectances and putative <em>sui
generis</em> colors (see Pautz 2017 for discussion).</p>

<p>
A specific form of the objection from causal considerations is called
&ldquo;The Causal Exclusion Argument&rdquo;. Given that the
Primitivist/Na&iuml;ve Realist account of colors requires that colors
are causally involved in the production of color experiences, it is
argued that this would imply that there is causal over-determination
in that production. The color experiences of material surfaces would
be caused both by the colors and by the microscopic particles that are
in the surface. Allen (2016) provides a penetrating analysis of, and
defence against, this argument. In so doing, he argues for a thesis
that he calls <em>Causal Compatibilism</em>. that the two causal
stories (narratives)&mdash;appealing to colors and to (the grounds of)
spectral reflectances, independently, are compatible. There is
over-determination, he concludes, but not a pernicious one.</p>

<p>
As Allen also points out, there is a separate line of support for
Causal Compatibilism, which depends on arguing that there are
different kinds of causes and different kinds of causal explanation.
It is now widely accepted that the structure of causal explanation is
complex, and that often different explanations apply to different
aspects of the events being explained. The point is that for many
situations, there are different explanatory spaces available, and that
different explanations&mdash;operating at different
levels&mdash;occupy different explanatory spaces. (See the entry on
 <a href="../causal-explanation-science/">causal approaches to scientific explanation</a>.)
 Gert (2008, 2017, 2020) and many others make judicious use of these
considerations in defence of Color Primitivism. Making progress on
these questions, as we can see, will require making progress on
theories of visual perception.</p>

<p>
Another major problem for the realist version of Color Primitivism is
one that Hardin (1988 [1993], 2004, 2008) and Cohen (2009) have
especially stressed. They draw attention to a vast range of facts
concerning the variety of conditions under which objects appear to
have the colors they do, and the variety of classes of observers for
whom the colors appear. Since the only way to determine what
primitivist color a body has is by the way it appears, this raises the
question of which is the body&rsquo;s real color. Normal perceivers,
for example, divide into different groups on whether a body&rsquo;s
color is, say, unique blue, or rather, a slightly reddish-blue, an
even more reddish blue, or, alternatively, a greenish blue. Cohen and
Hardin argue that there is no non-arbitrary way to pick out one group
of perceivers as identifying the &ldquo;real&rdquo; color. At most,
one group is correct, but we would not know which; for all we know,
none of the groups is identifying the real color. Averill (1992)
presents a pair of arguments that also depend on difficulties that
stem from trying to give a non-arbitrary account of normal observers
and standard viewing conditions. We can easily suppose changes in
either our eyes (and hence in normal observers) or in standard viewing
conditions, such that some objects that previously were yellow would
look red, and others would still look yellow&mdash;while remaining
otherwise physically unchanged. If primitive colors are supposed to be
supervenient on physical microstructures, then it is difficult to see
how we could accommodate this sort of change. A possible, but radical,
response to this problem is to modify the Realist position and to hold
that objects can have more than one color (indeed have many colors).
See Kalderon 2007 and Mizrahi 2006 for a defense of this view.</p>

<p>
A stronger form of this objection is what is called &ldquo;the
Inter-Species Variation&rdquo;. Allen concedes that this version is
much harder to dismiss: Color perception varies much more dramatically
across the animal kingdom than it does amongst human perceivers. The
solution to this problem, he says is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
to allow that at least some of the varying experiences of different
colour perceivers are veridical because physical objects
simultaneously instantiate a plurality of colours that different
perceiver types veridically perceive. (Allen 2016: 66)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is to say, he draws upon the Color Pluralism defended by Kalderon
and Mizrahi. For some, this move seems a desperate one, but it is hard
to give a stronger objection.</p>

<h3 id="RedColPhy">2.2 Reductive Color Physicalism</h3>

<p>
Another common form of Color Objectivism is that colors are objective
(mind-independent), properties of material bodies and light sources,
whose natures are &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; from us, and require empirical
investigation to discover. This theory is commonly known as
<em>Physicalist Color Realism</em> or <em>Color Physicalism,</em> but
perhaps the most informative title is <em>Reductive Color
Physicalism</em>. (The properties that constitute the colors, for
Color Primitivism, are &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in one good sense of the
term.)</p>

<p>
Perhaps the earliest defender of this second form of Color Objectivism
was Thomas Reid, the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher. More
recent examples are Armstrong (1969); Hilbert (1987): Matthen (1988);
Jackson (1996, 1998, 2007); Tye (2000); Byrne &amp; Hilbert (2003);
and McLaughlin (2003). Reid held a striking view of how &ldquo;the
folk&rdquo; think of color.</p>

<p>
Reid wrote that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By colour, all men who have not been tutored by modern philosophy
understand, not a sensation of the mind, which can have no existence
when it is not perceived, but a quality or modification of bodies,
which continues to be the same whether it is seen or not. (Reid 1764:
ch. 6, sect. 4 [1970: 99])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It would seem that, so far, Reid is simply displaying the common sense
for which he is famous. More controversially, however, he goes on to
say that when we perceive the color of body,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That idea, which we have called <em>the appearance of colour</em>,
suggests the conception and belief of some unknown quality in the body
which occasions the idea, and it is to this quality and not the idea,
that we give the name of <em>colour</em>. (Reid 1764: ch. 6, sect. 4
[1970: 100])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the face of it, this view of Reid seems counter-intuitive. Many of
&ldquo;those men not tutored by modern philosophy&rdquo;, have a lot
to say about colors, and would be surprised to be told that colors are
unknown qualities (and women, too, one suspects). Red, for example, is
the color used by many revolutionary parties, good for annoying bulls,
my favorite color, the color of my true love&rsquo;s lips, and so on.
We can give paradigms of blue, red, yellow, turquoise, mauve, etc. We
often say things such as &ldquo;that is a better blue than
this&rdquo;. One suspects that they (the untutored) would be puzzled
by the remark that red is some unknown quality (for more on this, see
Hacker 1987: 186).</p>

<p>
Reid&rsquo;s view may be extreme but it helps us appreciate the
significance of the view of a contemporary color physicalist,
McLaughlin, who singles Reid out as anticipating his account of color.
McLaughlin explicitly endorses this view of Reid though, in fact, his
position is subtly different. He defends a functionalist analysis of
color, according to which a color, say redness, is the occupant of a
certain functional role:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Redness is that property which disposes its bearers to look red, to
standard visual perceivers in standard conditions of visual
observation, and which must (as a matter of nomological necessity) be
held by everything so disposed. (McLaughlin 2003: 479)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
McLaughlin adds that this proposal is intended as providing a
conceptual analysis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The proposal is intended as a functional or topic-neutral analysis of
the concept of redness. The role description &ldquo;that property
which &hellip;&rdquo; is intended not only to fix the referent of the
concept, but also to express a condition that is necessary and
sufficient for satisfying it. Thus, if the proposal is correct, then
all it takes for a property to be redness is for it to fill the
redness role. (McLaughlin 2003: 479)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
McLaughlin&rsquo;s proposal is different, in a crucial respect, from
Reid&rsquo;s. It does not explicitly state that the property, which is
the occupant of the functional role, is a property
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo; to the observer. His proposal is designed to be
&ldquo;topic-neutral&rdquo;. This means that colors could either be
some complex physical properties, that could only be discovered by
scientific investigation, or they could be the sort of properties
described by Primitivists: <em>sui generis</em>, simple, intrinsic,
qualitative, non-relational, non-reducible properties of physical
bodies. McLaughlin argues that scientific investigation makes it
highly plausible that the occupant of the role is some complex
physical property&mdash;that is, that Color Physicalism is
true&mdash;and that no good reason favors the Primitivist option.</p>

<p>
One of the virtues of this form of Color Physicalism is that it offers
a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of color constancy, the
fact that there is strong tendency for the same object to look to have
the same color in a wide variety of illuminations. Against this claim,
however, it has been argued that other theories have the resources to
explain the phenomenon (to the extent that it occurs, for which there
are certain limits&mdash;see Hardin 1988, Cohen 2009, Chirimuuta
2008.)</p>

<p>
An initial problem is &ldquo;the problem of multiple
realizations&rdquo;: there is a wide range of different types of
bodies that have colors&mdash;light sources, illuminants, surfaces
(e.g., of apples, cars, cloths, paintings, &hellip;), volumes (e.g.,
wine, glass, atmospheres, &hellip;), bodies that scatter light, bodies
that diffract light, films, and luminescent bodies. The causes of the
colors objects appear to have, are many and varied. For most
theorists, however, the most plausible physicalist candidates for the
colors are light-related properties, e.g., capacities to emit,
reflect, absorb, transmit or scatter light to varying degrees. For
physical surfaces, the color is taken to be related to the
object&rsquo;s reflectance profile, i.e., the capacity to
differentially reflect wavelengths from different regions of the
incident illumination. It turns out, however, that, for each surface
color, there is no single reflectance curve associated with that
color, but many. The situation is similar, in the case of film colors
or aperture colors. That is to say, for each color, there is a set of
metamers. (Two stimuli&mdash;bodies, sources of light, etc.&mdash;that
differ in their physical characteristics, but are matched in
appearance under a certain illumination, by the same observer, are
metamers for that observer, in that illumination. Two bodies that are
metamers in one illumination need not be metamers under a different
illumination, or for a different observer.)</p>

<p>
The favored response to this problem is to say, for example, that a
given color, red, say, is not a specific color reflectance, but a type
of reflectance, i.e., one that is a member of a certain group.
However, there are still problems. Averill (1992, 2005), for example,
presents some interesting arguments, which are based on plausible
conjectures about how normal observers and standard conditions might
easily enough change, with consequent metameric change. The color
physicalist seems to be committed to a very arbitrary grouping of
reflectances into the various types.</p>

<p>
This problem is related to one that Hardin (1988 [1993], 2004) and
Cohen (2009) have drawn attention to. It has to do with the problem of
identifying, in a non-arbitrary way, <em>normal conditions</em>, and
<em>standard observers</em>. The objectivist account requires that we
identify the &ldquo;real&rdquo; color for object <em>X</em> as a
certain causal basis (e.g., the reflectance profile) for the way it
appears, to normal observers and in standard conditions. The problem
is that, as Hardin has persuasively pointed out, particularly, in
Hardin 2004, this cannot be done except in a highly arbitrary way. Not
only is there a minority of color perceivers who are anomalous (only
slightly, but appreciably so) with respect to normal observers, but
there is a considerable statistical spread even within the group of
normal observers. For example, the reflectance profile for unique
green will differ for different members of the &ldquo;normal
group&rdquo;. One can decide, of course, on a standard and fix one
reflectance profile as green, but the procedure is highly arbitrary.
As we have seen, there are few interesting causal powers associated
with colors apart from the way objects affect perceivers. (This
argument has led to a vigorous debate in the pages of
<em>Analysis</em>, see Byrne &amp; Hilbert 2007b; Cohen, Hardin &amp;
McLaughlin 2006, 2007; and Tye 2006a,b, 2007.)</p>

<p>
To counter this problem, McLaughlin suggests that we extend a
proposal, which Jackson and Pargetter (1987) made, originally to
overcome the problem of multiple realizations. They proposed
relativising the concept of color, to kinds of objects and
circumstances. McLaughlin&rsquo;s suggestion is that we could extend
the objectivist concept of color, by relativising it to individual
observers.</p>

<p>
Another major objection to the physicalist (reductive) account
concerns whether the properties can satisfy the principle of
&ldquo;Unity&rdquo;, as described by Johnston,
 (<a href="#ColWeOrdTalThiAboThe">see section 1.</a>4).
 This principle points to the fact that the various colors, it would
seem, are the kinds of properties that fit together in characteristic
ways to form structured color arrays, with a distinctive 3-dimensional
character, built on attributes such as hue/saturation/brightness (or
hue, chroma, lightness). The principle of Unity would seem to pose a
serious problem for the Color Physicalist (see Hardin 1988 [1993];
Thompson 1995; Maund 1995, 2011). As McLaughlin concedes, the problem
is that no physical properties that are even remotely plausible
candidates for being the properties essentially participate in these
patterns of relationships. (McLaughlin 2003: 487) His solution to the
problem is that the comparative claims, e.g., about red, orange and
blue&mdash;orange is more similar to red than to blue&mdash;are true
in virtue of a comparative fact about the visual experiences in
question.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Colors themselves participate in the similarity and difference
relationships derivatively&mdash;in virtue of the participation of the
visual experiences that they dispose their bearers to produce.
(McLaughlin 2003: 487)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The claim, here, is that what it is like for something to look red is
more similar to <em>what it is like</em> for something to look orange
than it is to <em>what it is like</em> for something to look blue.
This solution, however, raises the question of what features of the
experience are relevant ones, i.e., are the features which stand in
the relations of similarity and difference. There seem to be two
possibilities: (i) they are features of the experiences themselves;
(ii) they are features presented in experience or represented in them,
i.e., they are features of regions of visual fields, or of sensa, or
of material objects. There are some prima facie problems which ensue.
Assuming the former possibility, then our color experiences involve
massive error. The judgments of similarity and difference are applied
to the colors and not to our experiences. If the second possibility is
adopted, i.e., it is held that there are certain features, presented
in, or represented in, experience, then they stand in the relations of
similarities and differences. These features are different from
reflectances, so the color physicalist needs to say what they are.</p>

<p>
Tye (2000) and Byrne and Hilbert (2003), have proposed a solution to
this last problem, one that depends on exploiting the
opponent-processing model of color vision (see
 <a href="color-science-complexities.html">Supplement: Color Science&mdash;Some Complexities</a>).
 It is to specify the relevant groups of spectral reflectances,
associated with each color, in terms of their capacity to produce
suitable responses of the visual system. The proposal, by Byrne and
Hilbert, has two parts:</p>

<ol>

<li>color experience are characterized as having a certain
representational content: they represent objects as having what Byrne
and Hilbert call &ldquo;hue magnitudes&rdquo;;</li>

<li>the hue-magnitudes are explained in terms of being certain
physical properties, i.e., reflectance-types.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Over-simplifying, the physical properties contribute to the
representational content of experiences by virtue of stimulating
respective types of cones in such a way as to ground the judgements
concerning the hues&mdash;both unique and binary. As they argue, if we
can give the right account of how the magnitudes contribute to the
representational content, then we can explain the similarity relations
among the hues and the binary/unique distinction, in terms of the
content of color experience. On their proposal, the representational
content of color experience has an underlying complexity. This
proposal, in turn, has been subject to criticism from several authors,
e.g., Hardin (2003), Pautz (2006, 2020), Maund (2011), and Allen
(2015, 2016). Allen presents a clear and sympathetic reading of the
hue-magnitude proposal, although he thinks it does not work.</p>

<p>
There has been a very interesting recent development in the debate
about the Argument from Structure. In a paper in 2019, W. Wright draws
attention to a range of (mostly) recent empirical studies which
challenges some key assumptions that have underpinned that debate. He
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Examination of relevant empirical findings shows that claims about the
unique hues which play a central role in the argument from phenomenal
structure should be rejected. Chiefly, contrary to widespread belief
amongst philosophers and scientists, the unique hues do not play a
fundamental role in determining all color appearances. (W. Wright
2019: 1514)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Wright believes that the received thinking about unique hues to be
deeply flawed in a way that undermines this whole line of argument
against physicalism. It should be noted that this approach does not
vindicate color Physicalism&mdash;there are other arguments against
it&mdash;but it does mean that one of the most common arguments
against is flawed. He argues that the four canonical unique hues are
not nearly as special as they are claimed to be and that they do not
have the fundamental, organizing role in color experience routinely
accorded to them. The empirical findings are significant in view of
the fact that previous empirical work in color science seemed to
cohere with the phenomenological readings.</p>

<p>
Wright also highlights the work of Malkoc et al., where they write
that &ldquo;the unique hues do not emerge as special and do not alone
fully anchor the structure of color appearance for an
individual.&rdquo; (W. Wright 2019: 1527&ndash;28 quoting Malkoc et
al. 2005: 2155). Commenting on this and other work, Wright says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the light of their findings and the rest of the research examined
so far, I would go further and say that it is difficult to see why the
unique hues should be accorded any privileged status (in theorizing
about perception) or thought to play a fundamental role in determining
all color appearances. (W. Wright 2019: 1528)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He concludes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The empirical problems that have emerged for the standard account of
the unique hues are significant and undermine its psychophysical,
neural, and phenomenological plausibility. Thus it is appropriate to
consider theories of color that are not grounded in the unique hue
construct (Jameson and D&rsquo;Andrade 1997, p. 309; Wool et al. 2015:
9). (W. Wright 2019: 1528]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is a very informative article on the role and status of the
unique hues by Matthen (2020). The essay is an extensive study of
theories and experimental work focusing on the unique hues. In this
paper, Matthen argues that the function of opponent processing is
non-informational: to enhance discriminability and to format color in
a way that admits of combining distinct elements. This indicates, he
says, that individual differences that relate to the opponent
representation of color&mdash;the unique hues, the proportion of hue
magnitudes in perceived color, the color categories&mdash;have no
significance regarding external reality. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Some philosophers have suggested that some things in the world are
uniquely blue independently of any perceptual system. This contradicts
the function of opponent processing as I have presented it. Matthen
2020: 172&ndash;173)</p>

<h3 id="ColEli">2.3 Color Eliminativism/Irrealism/Fictionalism</h3>

<p>
There is a group of views about color, which come under one or all of
the labels, Color Irrealism, Color Eliminativism, The Illusory Theory
of Color, Color Fictionalism. These theories are ones that deny that
material objects and light sources actually have colors, i.e., that
lemons are yellow, skies are blue, some horses are chestnut, etc.
These titles are a little misleading, since it is possible for an
Eliminativist to also talk of there being colors in the sense of their
being dispositions to cause experiences of a characteristic type,
and/or being (attributes in/of) sensations. Some of the central color
physicists are prone to talk in this way, e.g., Descartes, Newton,
Boyle, Maxwell, (and Locke too). We may assume that they were
recommending a way of proceeding. We may take it, however, that what
the color-Eliminativist is denying, <em>usually,</em> is that material
objects, and sources of lights, (and illumination) have colors of a
certain kind: certain properties that we ordinarily, and
unreflectingly, take the bodies to have (see Section 1.2, above).
(Contemporary Eliminativists include Averill [2005], Boghossian &amp;
Velleman [1989], Hardin [1988 [1993]], Maund [1995, 2006, 2011],
Gatzia [2008 [2015]], and Pautz [2006, 2017, 2020]).</p>

<p>
As we have seen in the preceding Sections of this entity, there are
different theories as to what kinds of properties colors are (whether
or not they exist). The Eliminativist first argues (or assumes) that
there are certain conditions that properties must satisfy in order to
be colors, and second, s/he argues that there are no properties that
both satisfy these conditions, and are instantiated. It is against
that background that the Eliminativist denies that material bodies
(and source of light, and illumination) have colors.</p>

<p>
There is, however, a second requirement. In the earlier discussion,
Section 1.2, it was suggested that a credible theory of Color
Eliminativism would need to come in two parts: (a) providing reasons
for denying that objects&mdash;material surfaces, and sources of
light&mdash;have colors; (b) explaining why our linguistic practices
covering the use of color concepts and terms should seem as
viable/valuable to the extent that they are. The reason is one that
Realist Primitivists insist upon: the ordinary color talk and thought
is highly successful. The Eliminativist better have a good
explanation.</p>

<p>
The most general argument for Color Irrealism/Eliminativism is
addressed to this ordinary conception of color (and the use of
ordinary color terms.) In the most common form of the Argument, we
take it that the colors denied are properties of a certain sort:
<em>sui generis</em>, qualitative, irreducible features, that
collectively form a highly structured array of colors. In other words,
the Eliminativist is a Color Primitivist, but of a different sort from
Realist Primitivists. Against the latter, s/he will present objections
of the sort discussed in
 <a href="#PriSimObjVieCol">Section 2.1</a>.
 Primitivist Realism is the major target, but it is not the only one.
Against the other theories, the Eliminativist will mount objections,
of the sort raised in the various Sections in this entry.</p>

<p>
Most versions of Color Eliminativism/Irrealism commit one to an error
theory of visual experience. As Boghossian and Velleman put it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
visual experience is ordinarily naively realistic, in the sense that
the qualities presented in it are represented as qualities of the
external world. (1989 [1997: 93]; see also Averill 2005 and Maund
2011)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This leads them to explain how this happens by adopting a Projectivist
account of color experience: The projection posited by this account
has the result that the intentional content of visual experience
represents external objects as possessing qualities that belong, in
fact, only to regions of the visual field. By &ldquo;gilding or
staining all natural objects with the colors borrowed from internal
sentiments&rdquo;, as Hume puts it, the mind &ldquo;raises in a manner
a new creation&rdquo; (Boghossian &amp; Velleman 1989 [1997: 95]).</p>

<p>
In ordinary color experience, it is implied, physical objects are
represented (or presented) as having certain qualities that are
illusory, and accordingly, that experience involve errors. It is
important to keep in mind that such claims are not simply negative.
Illusions and errors can serve positive functions. The claim that
experiences represent objects as having qualities with a certain
character, can explain why we form the concepts we do, why we identify
and recognize objects, and so on. This means that it is still the case
that there are important reasons for retaining our ordinary color
concepts, even though they are not actualized. This fact motivates the
thought that the proper attitude to adopt towards our color language
is a fictionalist one: for many purposes we should think of the color
sentences with their ordinary meaning&mdash;but treat them only as if
they are true: we should make-believe that they are true (see Gatzia
2007, 2008 [2015]).</p>

<p>
Reference to Projectivism raises the suggestion that the visual
experience involves the presentation of a mental item, e.g., a sense
datum that has the color quality in question, e.g., reddishness, or
perhaps some reddish-like quality, which is involved in the
projection. Sense-data are thought by some to be completely
discredited, but they have been defended by a number of authors who
have pointed out the weakness of the &ldquo;discrediting
arguments&rdquo;, e.g., Robinson (1994), Crane 2000, Lowe (2008),
Maund (2003). There is not enough space to pursue this discussion. It
is important, however, to note that Pautz 2020 has presented a strong
defence of Irrealist Representationalism that does not depend on the
postulation of mental items. On his account, our color experiences
have representational content, where the property of being reddish is
co-instantiated with the property of being round.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
So it <em>seems</em> that these properties are instantiated together
before you. But, in fact, the property of being reddish is not
instantiated by <em>anything</em> &hellip;. There is no reddish thing
there of any kind, even though there seems to be one. So the property
<em>being reddish</em> is a bit like the property <em>being a
unicorn</em>: it is an entirely uninstantiated property. When it comes
to sensible colours at least, the brain is a kind of &ldquo;partial
virtual reality machine&rdquo;, which projects onto objects some
features that they don&rsquo;t really have. (Pautz 2020: 380)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One important form, Color Eliminativism can take, is Color
Fictionalism. This theory entails Color Eliminativism (or more
accurately, a strong version of color Eliminativism) but it implies
more positive theses. It implies that&mdash;with respect to a large
body of talk about colors, we should continue to use the terms in the
way we have learned. With respect to a vast number of color sentences,
it implies that we should adopt a certain attitude: we should make
believe the sentences are true. The world may not be filled with
colored objects, on this thesis, but the thesis also claims that the
world is such that <em>it is as if it</em> contains colored objects.
And for many purposes, that is as good as the real thing. (It is as
good as it gets.) (For a defense of Color Fictionalism, see Gatzia
2007, 2008 [2015]).</p>

<p>
Neither the properties posited by the Primitivist, nor those posited
by the Color Physicalist, it is argued, can satisfy all the required
constraints for being colors. As we saw in the last two sections, both
sorts of theorists have a response to this objection. The debate
between the Color Eliminativists and their opponents will thus depend
on the plausibility of such responses, and counter-responses (see the
earlier
 <a href="#PriSimObjVieCol">&sect;2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#RedColPhy">&sect;2.2</a>).
 As far as Realist Primitivism is concerned, one central issue is
this. The defense of this position, it seems, would need to appeal to
some version of Na&iuml;ve Realism, and/or Disjunctivism, and there
are strong arguments against these accounts. For example, it is not
clear how these accounts can handle the fact that many of our
experiences have both veridical and illusory elements: the Muller-Lyer
lines look unequal, when they are not; but they also look thin, and
look to be in front of me, and look black (see the entry on
 <a href="../perception-disjunctive/">the disjunctivist theory of perception</a>).
 (See Brewer 2008 on a reply; see also Pautz 2011, and the collection
of essays in Haddock &amp; Macpherson 2008.) Another important issue
is the one Hardin (2004, 2008) and Cohen (2009) raise: that it depends
on some non-arbitrary identification of standard conditions, and
normal observers, one that cannot be satisfied (see
 <a href="#PriSimObjVieCol">section 2.1</a>,
 above).</p>

<p>
Being an error theory of visual experience, Color Eliminativism is
sometimes thought to leave us with a severe problem (see Byrne &amp;
Hilbert 2007a). If there are no properties that satisfy the
requirements for being colors: how did the ordinary concept develop? A
plausible answer to this problem is found in the fact that the way
that the concepts of color operate, to serve their various functions
and roles, is through the way colors appear. For these purposes and
roles, objects do not need to have colors. It will be sufficient if
they appear to have them. For these purposes, it is sufficient that
&ldquo;it is as if they have the colors&rdquo;. We should also bear in
mind that errors and illusions and misrepresentations can be
beneficial and not deleterious, especially if the errors are
systematic. Mendelovici (2016, 2020) has developed an account of
reliable misrepresentation.</p>

<p>
Further, in response to the evolutionary problem, we might allow that
the reason why color vision evolved might be quite complex. Akins and
Hahn (2014) have a long, detailed, paper about the evolutionary
implications of color vision. They argue the reasons often assumed
don&rsquo;t measure up: they are based on the notion that the function
of color vision is &ldquo;to detect the colors&rdquo;. Things are far
more complex, they argue. (Chirimuuta [2015] argues for a similar
conclusion.) K.Akins and M. Hahn ask the question: What is the
function of human color vision? They go on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For most vision researchers, both philosophers and scientists, the
answer is obvious, they point out, nay, a tautology: color vision is
&ldquo;for&rdquo; seeing the colors, <em>whether or not color is a
genuine property of the external world</em> (my emphasis). We have
color vision to see the sky as blue, apples as red, and Heineken beer
bottles as translucent green. (Akins &amp; Hahn 2014: 126)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Akins and Hahn argue that the explanation for evolutionary advantage
is more complex, and it depends on characteristics of the visual
system underpinning color vision, and the overall structure/function
of the visual system. Additionally, Akins and Hahn stress that what is
important in acquiring wavelength information is not information of
the relevant physical properties, but rather information of
<em>contrasts</em> between properties. The Eliminativist can make the
point here that contrasts between two errors can be just as valuable
as contrasts between two real things. A chessboard with red and yellow
pieces (or white and yellow, or &hellip;) can be just as efficient as
one with black and white pieces (ditto for the squares).</p>

<h3 id="ColSub">2.4 Color Subjectivism</h3>

<p>
The reference that has just been made to the evolutionary development
of color vision brings out an important point that is often lost sight
of in critiques of Color Eliminativism/Color Fictionalism. Thinking of
the theory as a form of Color Eliminativism (which it is) highlights
the negative aspect to the theory. However there is also a positive
aspect to the theory, one that is brought to the front by those
versions of the theory that defend Color Subjectivism.</p>

<p>
Simplifying, Color Subjectivism can take either of two forms:</p>

<ol>

<li>As part of a Dual Referent theory: there are two different types
of context in which color terms apply, one in which the color terms
apply to a subjective quality; one in which the terms are intended to
apply to some property possessed by material objects, lights,
illumination, etc. (see D.H. Brown 2006). Adopting this theory is
compatible with either realist or eliminativist accounts of objective
colors (colors attributed to material objects, volumes, illumination,
etc.). Hardin would seem to hold the eliminativist version of this
theory (though he does not explicitly address the question).</li>

<li>As playing an explanatory role in explaining how our color
concepts take the form that they do. One version of this alternative
is the theory defended by C. Peacocke (1984). Another version is one
in which subjective qualities form part of a Projectivist theory of
visual experiences. On one version of this account, there are
subjective qualities which our visual system attributes to material
objects and lights, etc. These subjective qualities are qualities
which belong to (are intrinsic to) the visual experience. They are
sometimes marked as being the properties blue*, red*, yellow*,
orange*, etc. Again, this theory is compatible with either realist or
eliminativist views of objective colors. (Arguably, the famous color
physicists&mdash;Descartes, Newton, Young, Maxwell, etc.&mdash;held
eliminativist versions of this theory. So do Boghossian &amp; Velleman
1989). A comprehensive discussion of these issues is presented in
Robinson (2020) and D.H. Brown 2010. Projectivism is set out and
defended in Boghossian and Velleman 1989 [1997], W. Wright 2003,
Averill 2005.</li>
</ol>

<p>
One of the interesting topics that involve Color Subjectivism concerns
the relation, if any, between colors and shapes. Reflection on our
experiences of color would seem to suggest that we should accept the
following principle about the modal relations between shape and
color:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is impossible for something to have a color without having a shape,
i.e., without being spatially extended in some way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is a question here as to whether the principle holds with
respect to the ways these properties appear, i.e., to the
phenomenology of our experiences, or whether it applies to the
metaphysics of the situation, i.e., to the properties of colors and
shapes.</p>

<p>
Cutter 2018 has an interesting discussion of the topic. He points out
that many philosophers, especially in the wake of the seventeenth
century, have endorsed an <em>inegalitarian</em> view of shape and
color, according to which shape is objective or mind-independent,
while color is subjective or mind-dependent. Cutter argues that the
modal relations between shape and color make this combination of views
untenable. Instead, he holds, we must embrace some form of
<em>egalitarianism</em>, according to which shape and color are, in a
sense to be clarified, either both objective or both subjective.</p>

<p>
This is an interesting topic. There does seem to be an intimate
relation between colors and shapes&mdash;at least with respect to the
visual experience of colors and shapes. One avenue, however, which
might need to be explored in greater detail concerns whether we need
to acknowledge two types of colors: subjective and objective colors.
and two types of shapes, subjective and objective shapes. As we saw
above, D.H.Brown&rsquo;s Dual Referent theory implies that there are
two different types of context in which color terms apply: one in
which the color terms apply to a subjective quality; another, in which
the terms are intended to apply to some property possessed by material
objects, lights, illumination, etc. For a theory which appeals to
subjective colors as part of an explanation of color experiences, it
is open to them to posit subjective shapes, as well, as part of the
explanation.</p>

<h3 id="ColDis">2.5 Color Dispositionalism</h3>

<p>
Color-Dispositionalism is the view that colors are dispositional
properties: powers to appear in distinctive ways to perceivers (of the
right kind), in the right kind of circumstances; i.e., to cause
experiences of an appropriate kind in those circumstances. Because
they involve responses on the part of color-perceivers, such theories
are often called &ldquo;subjectivist&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
This theory takes different forms. One form it takes is that
associated with people in the scientific tradition, e.g., Descartes,
Boyle, Newton and Locke. This is the view that colors are secondary
qualities. However, as we saw earlier, in
 <a href="#ResEli">section 1.2</a>,
 this form of the dispositionalist view was part of a complex package,
related to the emerging scientific world-view. For our current
purposes, there are two crucial components to this package. The first
is the idea that we should distinguish between two notions of
<em>color</em>: color as a property of physical bodies, and color as
it is in sensation (or, as it is sometimes described,
&ldquo;color-as-we-experience-it&rdquo;). The second is that the
secondary quality view is not thought of as capturing the
common-sense, or &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo;, way of thinking of color.
Rather, it is thought of as a revision or reconstruction of the
ordinary concept.</p>

<p>
There is a different form the dispositionalist view of colors has more
recently taken, and which has many philosophical defenders, e.g.,
Bennett (1971), Dummett (1979), McDowell (1985), McGinn (1983),
Peacocke (1984), Johnston (1992), and Levin (2000). These philosophers
reject the claim that the dispositionalist view is in conflict with
any commonsense view of color. It is held by some that
dispositionalism can be defended as an analytic thesis, concerning the
meaning of color terms; it is held, or implied, by others that
possession of the concept of color is neutral on the precise nature of
the colors, a nature which consists in being dispositional. One virtue
of this account is that, if it is correct, there is no need to agree
that science is in conflict with our intuitive notions of color, or
that it shows that ordinary color talk is mistaken, or in need of
reconstruction. Another virtue would be that it would explain what
seems to be an important feature of color concepts, as opposed to
primary quality concepts: that in order to grasp, fully, color
concepts, it is necessary to have color experiences. (It is
interesting that, as Adams [2016] points out, Aristotle&rsquo;s
account of color rejects this assumption: For Aristotle, the function
of vision is to detect colors, perceiver-independent colors.)</p>

<p>
A prominent defender of dispositionalism is Johnston (1992), whose
account of the major constraints upon a theory of color we examined in
an earlier section. He concedes that dispositionalism has difficulty
handling the constraint imposed by commitment to the doctrine of
Revelation but, he thinks, giving this up is a small price to pay. He
maintains that, nevertheless, the theory can handle all the other
constraints, and in so doing has major advantage over rival accounts.
One of the theory&rsquo;s merits is that it can account for the
Principle of Unity,
 <a href="#beliefunity">item (3) in his list</a>,
 although as we have seen, this principle needs to be extended.
Another merit of Johnston&rsquo;s version of dispositionalism is that
it handles what seems to be a difficulty for other versions, the
problem of explaining the causal role of color in the perception of
colors, that is to say, the problem of meeting
 <a href="#beliefexplanationa">constraint (2)</a>
 on his list:</p>

<ol start="2">

<li id="beliefexplanationb"><em>Explanation</em>. The fact of a
surface or volume or radiant source being canary yellow sometimes
causally explains our visual experience as of canary yellow
things.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It has been argued that dispositionalist accounts of color cannot
handle this causal requirement, e.g., Jackson 1998. Johnston&rsquo;s
reply to this objection is that the dispositions do not have to be
thought of as bare dispositions. We can, instead, think of them as
&ldquo;constituted dispositions&rdquo;, which are thought of as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A constituted disposition is a higher-order property of having some
intrinsic properties which, oddities aside, would cause the
manifestation of the disposition in the circumstances of
manifestation. (Johnston 1992 [1997: 147])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus it is part of what it is to have a constituted disposition to
have some property, which is the causal ground of the manifestation of
the disposition.</p>

<p>
There have been two major objections to dispositionalism. These have
been discussed (and rejected) by Levin (2000). One objection is that
the dispositionalist theory cannot give a satisfactory account of the
phenomenology of visual color experiences. Let us come back to this
objection. The second major problem is that it cannot dissolve what
many think is the central problem of dispositionalism, the problem of
characterizing just what the colors of objects are supposed to be,
&ldquo;without vacuity, circularity, regress or any other such
damaging vice&rdquo; (Levin 2000: 162). The circularity problem
reflects the way the dispositionalist thesis is usually
formulated:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>X</em> is red = <em>X</em> has the disposition to look red to
normal perceivers, in standard conditions.</p>
</div>

<p>
If we understand the phrase &ldquo;to look red&rdquo;, on the right
hand side, to mean &ldquo;to look to be red&rdquo;, then it would seem
we have troubles. As Levin puts it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If an object is red iff it&rsquo;s disposed to look red (under
appropriate conditions), then an object must be disposed to look red
iff it&rsquo;s disposed to look to be disposed to look red &hellip;
and so on, ad infinitum. (Levin 2000: 163)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is a range of techniques that Dispositionalists have devised to
avoid the circularity problem. They include proposals to understand
&ldquo;looks red&rdquo; differently from that assumed above, and
proposals to characterize the disposition differently. In addition, it
is sometimes argued that the circularity is benign. (For further
discussion, see Levin 2000 and Byrne &amp; Hilbert 2011.)</p>

<p>
One particularly interesting solution to the circularity problem is
that provided by Peacocke 1984 [1997]. Peacocke defends what he calls
an &ldquo;experientialist&rsquo;s version&rdquo; of the theory, one
which requires the introduction of a third property, besides those of
being red, and looking red&mdash;a sensational property, that of being
red*. According to this account, the property red is explained not in
terms of looking red, but in terms of causing the perceiver to have
presented to him, sensational properties in a visual field. (For
discussion, see Boghossian and Velleman 1989 [1997])</p>

<p>
The more pressing problem, however, for Color Dispositionalism is
whether it can give an adequate account of the phenomenology of visual
experience. The phenomenological problem, as McGinn describes it, is
that color properties do not look much like dispositions to produce
color experiences, so that an error theory of color perception comes
to seem inescapable. Colors turn out not to look the way they are said
dispositionally to be, &ldquo;which is to say that ordinary color
perception is intrinsically and massively misleading&rdquo; (McGinn
1996: 537). Rather than adopting a dispositionalism with that
consequence, McGinn falls back on a Primitivist view of color, a view
that resists both criticisms leveled at dispositionalism.</p>

<p>
Levin 2000 has provided a powerful reply, on behalf of the
dispositionalist, to McGinn&rsquo;s argument. Her challenge is
complex, highlighting the assumptions that underpin McGinn&rsquo;s
criticism (and has a detailed discussion of the relevance of the
doctrine of Revelation). An important question seems to remain,
however. In McGinn&rsquo;s formulation of the phenomenological
problem, there are two distinct claims, each of which is crucial:</p>

<ol>

<li id="claim1">Colors do not look like the sorts of dispositional
properties they would have to be if the dispositional thesis were
correct: &ldquo;Colors turn out not to look the way they are said
dispositionally to be&rdquo;.</li>

<li id="claim2">Colors look like non-dispositional properties: when we
see an object as red we see it as having a simple, monadic, local
property of the object&rsquo;s surface.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second claim is expanded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we see an object as red &hellip; [the] color is perceived as
intrinsic to the object, in much the same way that shape and size are
perceived as intrinsic. No relation to perceivers enters into how the
color appears; the color is perceived as wholly on the object, not as
somehow straddling the gap between it and the perceiver. (McGinn 1996:
541&ndash;542)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One possibility that this claim raises is that even if it is true, as
Levin argues, that our visual experiences are such that objects look
to have dispositional properties of the sort the
color-dispositionalist is committed to, it will also be the case
(often at least) that the colored objects look to be manifesting that
disposition. McGinn&rsquo;s
 <a href="#claim2">claim (2)</a>
 may then apply to the manifestation of the disposition. If so, the
dispositionalism would seem to be allied to an error theory, as he
suggests.</p>

<p>
Byrne and Hilbert (2011) provide a detailed examination of Color
Dispositionalism, which they stress, can take different forms. They
think that several of these forms can escape both the circularity and
phenomenological problems, highlighted by McGinn, in part because they
disagree with him on the phenomenology. They have different criticism
of the theory: that there is no good reason for accepting the theory.
They argue that the best reasons for accepting it depend on a highly
implausible theory of perception.</p>

<p>
Finally, another difficulty with dispositionalism, as it is standardly
expressed, is the one that Hardin (1988 [1993], 2004) has stressed. As
our knowledge of color vision has grown, it has become increasingly
more difficult to specify normal observers, and standard viewing
conditions in any but an arbitrary way, arbitrary from the point of
view of metaphysics. To be sure, there are conventional reasons for
picking out some observers and some viewing conditions as special, but
we can, without too much trouble, imagine these changing. And with
respect to normal observers, we have found that in fact, as things
stand, there is a wide range of variation among competent color
perceivers. As we shall see in the following section, these
considerations have led Cohen to modify the standard dispositionalist
account in favor of a &ldquo;more ecumenical&rdquo; color
relationalist theory, one that relativizes the dispositions to groups
of perceivers, and types of viewing conditions.</p>

<h3 id="ColRel">2.6 Color Relationalism</h3>

<p>
One of the most important developments in recent philosophy of color
has been the emergence of a radical relationalist view of colors.
Averill (1992) proposed a relational view of color, one that involves
a strong modification of the standard dispositional position. He
presents two arguments against both physicalist and dispositionalist
accounts, which depend on raising difficult questions for their
dependence on normal observers and standard viewing conditions. In
their place, he offers an account according to which colors of bodies
are relational properties. In explanation, he asks us to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; is regarded as a relational term
having two suppressed argument places, one argument takes populations
as values and ties any instance of being yellow to the normal
observers of a population, the other takes environments as values and
ties any instance of being yellow to the optimal viewing conditions of
an environment. (Averill 1992: 555)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cohen (2004, 2009) holds a similar position, though he has produced a
more general argument. For Cohen, Color Relationalism is the
metaphysical thesis that colors are relational properties of a certain
sort&mdash;relational with respect to perceivers and circumstances of
viewing. According to Color Relationalism, there are no such
properties as <em>blue</em>, <em>red</em>, <em>yellow</em>,
<em>orange</em>, etc. To be more precise, there are no such properties
as <em>blue simpliciter, red simpliciter</em>, and so on. What there
are, instead, are relational properties: blue-for-perceiver
<em>A</em>-in-circumstances C1, red-for-perceiver
<em>B</em>-in-circumstances C2, yellow-for-perceiver
<em>D</em>-in-circumstances C3, and so on.</p>

<p>
At the heart of Cohen&rsquo;s account is a certain argument, which he
calls his &ldquo;Master Argument&rdquo;. This argument depends on
pointing out the extent to which the colors things look to have, vary
with different viewing conditions, different classes of perceivers,
and different types of animals. In short, it is built upon the premise
that there is a vast range of situations in which there are variations
in the way something looks, either to the same subject under different
viewing conditions, or to different subjects under the same
conditions.</p>

<p>
Then follows the crucial question: Can we select one amongst these
perceptual variants that should be regarded as veridically
representing the color of the object (where this would mean that the
other variants are representing the object&rsquo;s color erroneously)?
It is just this question, Cohen suggests, to which it is difficult to
imagine a well-motivated, principled, and non-question-begging answer,
and thus leads to the formulation of the Master Argument. Given that
there is no well-motivated reason for singling out any single variant
(at the expense of the others), he argues, an ecumenical
reconciliation of the variants is preferable to an unmotivated
stipulation in favor of just one of them. He concludes: the best way
to implement such an ecumenical reconciliation between apparently
incompatible variants is to view them as the result of relativizing
colors to different values of different parameters (Cohen 2009:
24).</p>

<p>
The thrust of the Master Argument, powerful as it is, is largely
negative. It seems to rebut all objectivist theories of color, whether
the objectivist theory is one of the standard forms of color
realism&mdash;physicalist realism or primitivist realism&mdash;or
whether it is framed in terms of a disposition to appear, in
characteristic ways, to normal perceivers in standard circumstances.
On the face of it, only two candidates remain: Color Relationalism and
Color Irrealism. Cohen holds that Color Relationalism provides the
best solution to the problem outlined, but he concedes that Color
Irrealism also offers a solution. He thinks that that view ought to be
rejected, on independent grounds. The argument against Color Irrealism
is that it is a &ldquo;theory of last resort&rdquo;, one that we
should accept only after all other candidates have been rejected, when
no other alternative remains. The crucial issue between these two
theories, it would seem, is whether Color Relationalism can account
adequately for the phenomenology of visual experience. Cohen&rsquo;s
response to this problem is similar to that of Levin, in her defense
of Color Dispositionalism (see Maund 2012).</p>

<h3 id="ActBasTheCol">2.7 Action-Based Theories of Color</h3>

<p>
There are other forms of color relationalism which deserve a section
of their own. They tend to see colors as hybrid properties combining
aspects of the perceiver&rsquo;s environment and phenomenology.</p>

<p>
One form has links to action-based theories of perception, as
developed principally by the psychologist, J. J. Gibson. A leading
example is the theory defended by Thompson, <em>The Ecological
View of Colors</em>. On this account, colors are taken to be
dependent, in part, on the perceiver and so are not intrinsic
properties of a perceiver-independent world. Being colored, instead,
is construed as a relational property of the environment, connecting
the environment with the perceiving animal. In the case of the color
of physical surfaces, &ldquo;being coloured corresponds to the surface
spectral reflectance as visually perceived by the animals&rdquo;
(Thompson 1995: 240; see also Ch. 5, pp. 242&ndash;250).</p>

<p>
In more detail this account is spelled out in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
being coloured a particular determinate colour or shade &hellip; is
equivalent to having a particular spectral reflectance, illuminance,
or emittance that looks that colour to a particular perceiver in
specific viewing conditions. (1995: 245)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thompson insists that this account is to be distinguished from both a
Lockean dispositionalist account and an error theory of colors.
Whether it is or not will depend on what account he can give of
&ldquo;as visually perceived by the animal&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Another important example of an action-based approach to perception is
the theory in No&euml; 2004. No&euml; defends what he calls <em>the
enactive approach to perception</em>. As in the case of Thompson, his
theory is guided by Gibson&rsquo;s work, albeit with modification.
No&euml; sets his view of color within this account, arguing that
color is a relational property, involving the object and the
environment, and crucially related to perceivers. In his theory of
perception, No&euml; emphasizes the role of perspectival properties.
He distinguishes, for example, between size and perspectival size,
i.e., <em>size in the visual field</em> or <em>how things look with
respect to size from here</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Size in the visual field is distinct property from size. It
corresponds to the size of the patch that one must fit in on given
plane perpendicular to the line sight in order to perfectly occlude an
object from view. (No&euml; 2004: 83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Actually, No&euml; makes a distinction between three kinds of
properties. Associated with the shape (and size) of an object, say, a
cube, is its <em>visual potential</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The <em>visual potential</em> of a cube (at least with respect to
shape) is the way its aspect changes as a result of movement (of the
cube itself or of the perceiver around the cube). Any movement
determines a set of changes in perceived aspect; any set of changes in
perceived aspects determines equivalent classes of possible movements.
(No&euml; 2004: 77)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Accordingly, in the case of shape and size, we can distinguish between
three kinds of properties: e.g., vision-independent shape,
shape&rsquo;s visual potential and perspectival shape. No&euml; models
his theory of color on the second kind of property: &ldquo;colors are
ways colored things change their appearances as color-critical
conditions change&rdquo; (No&euml; 2004: 141). This is an intriguing
theory. What isn&rsquo;t so clear is what exactly perspectival color
is.</p>

<p>
More recently, other forms of relational theories have emerged:
theories defended by Brogaard 2012, Chirimuuta 2015, and Chirimuuta
&amp; Kingdom 2015. Chirimuuta advocates a version of color
relationalism which she calls <em>Color Adverbialism</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
On this last account, colors are not properties of external physical
objects, or of brains, or of our mental states; instead, they are
properties of perceptual processes or interactions which involve
objects, brains and mental states. So, according to colour
adverbialism, &ldquo;seeing the colours&rdquo; means &ldquo;seeing in
a colourful way&rdquo;. (Chirimuuta &amp; Kingdom 2015: 226)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
She appeals, with Kingdom, to recent research on color vision, related
to the function of color vision, to argue that it provides great
difficulties for Objectivist color realism&mdash;both Primitivist and
Reductionist Physicalist&mdash;(see also Akins &amp; Hahn 2014). While
they admit that anti-realism, especially the form favored by Hardin,
is in a better position, they think that Color Adverbialism presents
the best explanation.</p>

<p>
Another important recent contributions to the philosophy of color is
the book by Matthen (2005). In this work, Matthen articulates a theory
of sense-perception in which color plays a prominent role. The work is
significant for the theory of color that he presents, one that draws
heavily on comparative studies of color vision among different
species. Matthen replaces his earlier objectivist views on color by an
account that has more in common with the ecological theory favored by
Thompson. Matthen agrees with Hardin, Thompson and others that the
phenomenology of color is not captured, or accounted for, by any of
the standard objectivist accounts. Nevertheless, he claims to be
defending a realist theory of color and to be rejecting standard
irrealist theories, including Hardin&rsquo;s. Matthen&rsquo;s account
is complex. The idea is that the senses (the visual sensory system) do
categorize objects as &ldquo;blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;, etc.,
but these qualities are related to actions that perceivers can
perform, and in particular, to &ldquo;epistemic affordances&rdquo;.
The sensory systems are held to be devices that are in the business of
classifying distal stimuli (physical objects) as having certain
properties, which stand in similarity and difference relations with
each other. These categories are constructed by the system and do not,
at least in the case of color, correspond to any objective properties
that are independent of perceivers.</p>
