<h1>Speusippus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu May 22, 2003; substantive revision Thu Aug 29, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Speusippus of Athens was the son of Plato&rsquo;s sister Potone; he
became head of the Academy on Plato&rsquo;s death in 348/347 and
remained its head for eight years (Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives</em>
IV 1), apparently until his death. His date of birth is harder to get
a fix on; it has reasonably been estimated at ca. 410. He apparently
wrote a lot: &ldquo;a great many treatises and many dialogues&rdquo;
(<em>Lives</em> IV 4; Diogenes lists about 30 titles, but his
bibliography, by his own admission, is incomplete). We have very
little of what he wrote, if any (we have something from a work later
attributed to him, <em>On Pythagorean Numbers</em>, discussed below,
but this is not one of Diogenes&rsquo; titles; scholars sometimes
claim that genuine material is also preserved by Iamblichus, <em>De
communi mathematica scientia</em> IV. The evidence is discussed
below).</p>

<p>
Diogenes tells us (<em>Lives</em> IV 1) that Speusippus &ldquo;abided
by the views of Plato&rdquo;; from what little we can tell, this is
simply false. In particular, Speusippus rejected the Theory of
Forms.</p>

<p>
References will be to the primary sources; the two most recent
collections of the fragments (Isnardi Parente 1980; Tar&aacute;n 1981)
have indices that will enable the reader to locate the texts (Lang
1911 does not). Citations from Plato and Aristotle are to any standard
edition; those from other ancient authors are taken from texts listed
in the bibliography (translations are by R. Dancy, but where an
alternative English translation is offered, they are referenced in the
text).</p>

<p>
Before discussing what we can infer from the texts at our disposal,
the entry provides an overview of scholarly approaches to the
material, highlighting how the different methodological perspectives
of scholars have produced very different depictions of
Speusippus&rsquo; thought. This contextual background is essential for
understanding the criteria shaping this and other interpretations of
the surviving testimonia.</p>

<h2 id="OveMaiSchAppMat">1. Overview of main scholarly approaches to the material</h2>

<p>
Two aspects in particular have marked the history of scholarly
interpretations of the Early Academy, and Speusippus specifically. On
the one hand, a hermeneutical drive: the urge to understand the
Platonic credentials of Plato&rsquo;s first successors. On the other
hand, a crucial and widely shared methodological assumption: Aristotle
is not and cannot be an accurate witness.</p>

<p>
The interaction of these two aspects, along with the varying degrees
of receptiveness towards different philosophically significant themes,
prompted scholars to prioritize certain sources over others, resulting
in a variety of different scholarly approaches. This, in turn, yielded
very different depictions of Speusippus&rsquo; philosophy. An overview
of the most influential approaches can be summarized as follows.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>Working on the assumption that Aristotle often twists the
philosophical views he presents, information from authors other than
Aristotle has been considered more reliable. Given the very
dichotomous transmission of material concerning Speusippus, mostly
preserved by either Aristotle or Middle and Neo-Platonic authors, this
perspective has led scholars to utilize texts that are more
chronologically distant from Speusippus to elucidate compatible
information found in Aristotle&rsquo;s work. This approach was
originally advanced by Merlan, who claimed that the material preserved
in Chapter 4 of Iamblichus&rsquo; <em>De communi mathematica
scientia</em> reproduced content concerning Speusippus (more on this
below). The compatibility of Iamblichus&rsquo; account with claims
found in Aristotle&rsquo;s texts led Merlan (1953 [1968]) to suppose
that Iamblichus likely had access to Speusippus&rsquo; writings, and
could provide complementary information that Aristotle did not
preserve. As an illustration, scholars supporting this view
significantly downplay Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism that Speusippus
envisioned an episodic world (i.e., a world where each ontological
layer is disconnected from the previous one; see Arist.
<em>Metaph</em>., &Lambda; 10, 1075b37&ndash;1076a5; N3,
1090b13&ndash;20), and believe this view should be corrected in the
light of Iamblichus&rsquo; description of a continuous system. Similar
readings have been advanced by scholars such as Kr&auml;mer (1964) and
the T&uuml;bingen school, and more recently by Metry (2002), and
Dillon (2003). These interpretations have a strong metaphysical focus,
and claim that some pioneering ideas that will become popular in
Middle-Platonism and Neoplatonism originated in the Early Academy as a
development of Plato&rsquo;s esoteric theories. Speusippus and
Xenocrates, for instance, have been read as postulating unitarian
generative systems produced by primary principles, to be understood as
principles of all things. This perspective has an invaluable
philosophical merit: by intimately connecting the development of later
streams of Platonism to the internal evolution of the Academy and
projecting the roots of their theories either in the future or in the
past, it finds a significant place for Early Academic philosophy
within the Platonist tradition.</li>

<li>Starting from the opposite assumption, namely that the material
preserved by Iamblichus cannot constitute an independent source of
Speusippean doctrine, an opposed methodological approach was advanced
by Tar&aacute;n with the publication of his collection (1981).
Tar&aacute;n&rsquo;s reconstruction is deeply rooted in
Aristotle&rsquo;s text, it is sensitive of the contexts in which
testimonia are preserved and grounded in a scrupulous analysis of the
Greek. Tar&aacute;n too, however, ultimately inherited from his
teacher Cherniss the idea that Aristotle is a generally unreliable
witness, and this is expressed as a need to get rid of
Aristotle&rsquo;s influence when interpreting material presenting
Speusippus&rsquo;s view. Thus, the data obtained via internal analyses
of Aristotle&rsquo;s text is dismissed when it is considered the
result of Aristotle&rsquo;s own criticism. As an illustration, the
charge of episodicity is rejected by Tar&aacute;n on completely
different grounds than method (i), namely, via assessment of the
argument construction and structure. In opposition to method (i), this
approach significantly downsizes the metaphysical commitments of
Speusippus: Iamblichus&rsquo; testimony is dismissed as unreliable,
and Speusippus&rsquo; primary principles, the One and Plurality, are
considered by Tar&aacute;n as nothing else than number one and two.
Tar&aacute;n&rsquo;s approach is precious insofar as it is
philologically precise and attentive, prioritizes a meticulous
analysis of the text, and highlights conclusively how important it is
to examine the context in which the testimonia are embedded.</li>

<li>A middle ground between approaches (i) and (ii) can be found in
Isnardi Parente&rsquo;s collection (1980). Although Aristotle is
considered a primary witness for the reconstruction of Early Academic
doctrines, the information is counter-balanced or combined with that
obtained by other sources (similarly, Dancy, in the previous version
of this entry, Dancy 2021). To keep on with the illustration, as we
would expect from a middle-ground approach, Isnardi Parente does not
dismiss Aristotle&rsquo;s charge of episodicity straight away but
contends that Aristotle is evasive as to how Speusippus would escape
the charge, that is by establishing <em>similarity</em> between the
various ontological layers of reality. Given the extensive work
Isnardi Parente conducted on many aspects of Early Academic
philosophy, her approach shows to be extremely helpful for the
analysis of individual fragments especially; in addition, this
approach allows for a more substantial assessment of subjects on which
Aristotle preserved almost nothing, or that are only tangentially
touched upon by different sources, such as, for instance,
Speusippus&rsquo; psychological theory.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of these methodological approaches has yielded distinctly
different portrayals of Speusippus, sometimes leading to incompatible
interpretations. Recent specialist approaches have predominantly
embraced Isnardi-Parente&rsquo;s middle-ground approach, reflecting a
shift towards a more nuanced appraisal of Aristotle&rsquo;s
reliability as a source. This trend highlights a growing preference
for problem-oriented analyses (see, e.g., B&eacute;natou&iuml;l &amp;
El Murr 2010; B&eacute;natou&iuml;l 2017; Horky 2018; De Cesaris 2023;
Benati 2024). Such efforts have proven especially valuable in
exploring the Platonic credentials of Early Academic views by focusing
on the problems these views sought to address, thus offering a more
dynamic understanding of the Platonist tradition, less focused on the
continuity of doctrines. Significant scholarly work on
Aristotle&rsquo;s texts has also conspicuously influenced this
reevaluation. While many studies have contributed to the broader
field, two unpublished works stand out for their significant impact on
the reconstruction of Early Academic philosophy: Crubellier&rsquo;s
(1994) analysis of books M and N of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Metaphysics</em>, and Menn&rsquo;s study of <em>The Aim and the
Argument of Aristotle&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em> (see
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Ultimately, what methodology one deems the most appropriate to the
material remains, of course, at the discretion of each interpreter.
However, it is crucial to recognize that these methodological
decisions, particularly in the absence of direct material, can lead to
markedly divergent conclusions. In this entry, significant focus is
placed on Aristotle&rsquo;s text, complemented by scholarly
evaluations of the material preserved by Iamblichus, to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the subject.</p>

<h2 id="Met">2. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
In the <em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle often presents brief summaries
of Plato&rsquo;s views and those of others. From these, we learn what
little we can about Speusippus and his contemporary, Xenocrates.</p>

<p>
According to Aristotle, all three of Plato, Speusippus, and Xenocrates
constructed their worlds operating with two principles
(<em>archai</em>): the One and something opposed to it. The latter
appears under different names, and it looks as if the different names
go with different ones among the three: &lsquo;the Indefinite
Dyad&rsquo; or &lsquo;the large and (the) small&rsquo; seem to be the
expressions favored by Plato, &lsquo;plurality&rsquo; seems to be
associated with Speusippus, and &lsquo;the unequal&rsquo; with
Xenocrates. And for Plato, the One was identified with the Good.</p>

<p>
These principles are primarily employed by these three thinkers in
connection with <em>numbers</em>. But there are two ranges of number
operating in Aristotle&rsquo;s discussions (see <em>Metaphysics</em> I
6, &Nu; 8&ndash;9). There are what he refers to as <em>formal</em>
numbers, one for each numeral; these are the (Platonic) Forms for
numbers. But since there is only one for each numeral, and a
mathematician has to be able to add two and two to get four, there is
another range of numbers required: the <em>mathematical</em> numbers,
indefinitely many for each numeral <em>n</em>, each of the
indefinitely many a collection of <em>n</em> units. As Aristotle has
it, Plato accepted both ranges, and Speusippus only mathematical
numbers; Speusippus, then, rejects Plato&rsquo;s Theory of Forms and
his belief in formal numbers.</p>

<p>
There are only two passages in which Aristotle mentions Speusippus by
name in dealing with his metaphysical views: <em>Metaphysics</em> Z 2,
1028b21 and &Lambda; 7, 1072b31. Neither passage can be considered
actual quoting, but there is some practice consensus for referring to
these and similar pieces of testimony concerning Speusippus as
&lsquo;fragments&rsquo;, given that this is how the two collections by
Isnardi Parente and Tar&aacute;n refer to the texts preserving
Speusippus&rsquo; view.</p>

<p>
The method followed in the reconstruction of Speusippus&rsquo; views
is a matter of chaining: we start from anchor texts and look for other
passages in which the views ascribed to him in them are under
discussion. Those passages will sometimes bring in new views; we then
ascribe those views to Speusippus, and go looking for passages in
which <em>those</em> views seem to be alluded to. When sketching out
summaries of the Platonists&rsquo; views, Speusippus is often
distinguished from Plato and Xenocrates (usually referred to as
&ldquo;those who posit the Forms&rdquo;) and spoken of as &ldquo;he
who posited mathematical number <em>only</em>&rdquo; or referred to
with similar formulations. This helps us gather more information.</p>

<p>
In the first of our two anchor texts (<em>Metaphysics</em> Z 2,
1028b18&ndash;24), while discussing the ways in which people have
answered the question &lsquo;what are the substances?&rsquo;,
Aristotle ascribes to Plato the view that there are not only
perceptible substances but eternal ones of two types: forms and
mathematical objects. He then says that Speusippus thought there were
even more types of substance; he &ldquo;started from the One&rdquo;
and adopted principles (<em>archai</em>) for each of his types of
substance: &ldquo;one for numbers, another for magnitudes, then for
soul&rdquo;. So we have at least four layers of beings: numbers,
magnitudes, souls, and perceptible beings; the One is
Speusippus&rsquo; starting point, but he has different principles for
each level of being.</p>

<p>
We find a confirmation of this structure of the world in another
passage of the <em>Metaphysics</em> (N 3, 1090b13&ndash;20):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Again, if one is not too easily satisfied, one might inquire further
with regard to all number and the objects of mathematics, that they
contribute nothing to one another, the prior to the posterior; for if
number did not exist, none the less magnitudes would exist for those
who maintain the existence of the objects of mathematics only, and if
magnitudes did not exist, soul and sensible bodies would exist. But
the phenomena show that nature is not a series of episodes, like a bad
tragedy (transl. Ross slightly modified).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here we can recognize Speusippus behind the reference to &ldquo;those
who maintain the existence of the objects of mathematics only&rdquo;.
The passage confirms that Speusippus&rsquo; world presents four layers
of beings: numbers, magnitudes, soul, and perceptible beings (here
listed explicitly). The passage also adds an important detail
concerning these layers, namely that, according to what Aristotle
says, they appear to be causally independent from one another. If one
level ceased to exist, no consequence would affect the other layers.
One possible way of reading the information provided by these two
Aristotelian texts together is that the postulation of principles for
each stage of reality serves precisely the purpose of rendering each
layer of beings independent.</p>

<p>
Aristotle more than once complains of Speusippus&rsquo;
&lsquo;episodic&rsquo; universe. From these critiques, it emerges
that, apparently, the train of causality did not start with the One
and go down through the various levels, but started anew at each
level. The same criticism is reiterated by Theophrastus
(<em>Metaph</em>., 4a 9&ndash;17). Scholars have resisted this
characterization of Speusippus&rsquo; world on various bases, but most
often by appealing to Iamblichus&rsquo; <em>DCMS</em> (more below)
where the One is said to be the same principle throughout, yet
realized in different ways at each level because of the matter it acts
upon. As the number 1, or the unit, at the level of numbers, as the
point, in what <em>DCMS</em> calls &lsquo;place&rsquo; or, we might
translate, &lsquo;locus&rsquo;, at the level of geometrical figures.
As it will be clearer below, endorsing or resisting such readings
depends on the methodological choices we make. Yet, if we grant that
Platonic participation constituted a crucial problem for Speusippus
(as the Principle of Alien Causality appears to suggest, more below),
the interventions in his system may be understandable considering the
epistemological advantages they may offer. If each ontological section
of the system is symmetrically separated from the others, each is
independent and to be investigated by means of specific
epistemological practices. In this picture, the mathematical layer
does not constitute a paradigmatic model for the sensible one, nor
does it express any causal functions over sensible bodies, the inquiry
into which deserves to be conducted according to different rules than
those reserved for mathematical and geometrical ones. Possibly for the
same reason each ontological domain has its peculiar principles: for
this may allow objects in each domain to remain homogeneous to one
another (i.e., to respond to the same definition) and prevent
principles of different levels from performing explanatory functions
at other levels.</p>

<p>
In the second anchor text (<em>Metaphysics</em> &Lambda; 7,
1072b30&ndash;1073a3), Aristotle, having just sketched a proof for the
existence of an unmoved mover, which he refers to as a principle
(<em>arche</em>) and as &lsquo;god&rsquo;, says something about
Speusippus&rsquo; views about principles: that he (and the
Pythagoreans) suppose that a principle is not characterizable as
&lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; or &lsquo;good&rsquo;, going on the analogy of
plants and animals, where beauty and goodness emerge in the end state
rather than the beginning.</p>

<p>
Then we begin chaining.</p>

<p>
In <em>Metaphysics</em> N 4&ndash;5, Aristotle discusses various
Platonistic views about the relationships between the first principles
and goodness; N 4, 1091a34&ndash;36 refers to contemporaries of
Aristotle&rsquo;s who deny that the good is among the principles but
suppose it comes in later in the development; the second of our two
anchor texts warrants the guess that Speusippus is among them. And
then some other things about the passage in N fall into place:
Speusippus&rsquo; main way of referring to the principle opposed to
the One was &lsquo;Plurality&rsquo;, and, more importantly, he denied
a theory about causality that was part of Plato&rsquo;s Theory of
Forms as we find that Theory in, say, the <em>Phaedo</em>: a theory to
the effect that the possession of a feature <em>F</em> by a
perceptible object was due to its participation in something supremely
<em>F</em> that transmits its being <em>F</em> to the perceptible
object; as opposed to this &lsquo;Transmission Theory of
Causality&rsquo;, Speusippus adopted what we might call a Principle of
Alien Causality: the first cause of <em>F</em>s is not itself
<em>F</em> (more details about this view in Dancy 1989 [1991:
77&ndash;112]).</p>

<p>
Speusippus&rsquo; Principle of Alien Causality has different
implications depending on how we understand the very structure of
Speusippus&rsquo; world. On the assumption that Speusippus&rsquo;
universe is a <em>generative</em> or <em>genealogical</em> one (i.e.,
one where the One somehow acts throughout <em>all layers</em> of
reality), the instantiation of the Principle of Alien Causality
pertains to the One with respect to <em>all beings</em>. In other
words, the principle should be understood as follows: the One,
considered as the cause of <em>all</em> beings, is not itself a being
(Dancy 1989 [1991]). This could find some confirmation in the
conclusion of a parallel argument by Aristotle in <em>Metaphysics</em>
N 5. 1092a11&ndash;17, where Aristotle appears to conclude that
&ldquo;the One would not even be a being&rdquo; and other remote
sources such as Latin translation of part of Proclus&rsquo; commentary
on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em> (more below).</p>

<p>
Differently, on the assumption that Speusippus&rsquo; universe is
<em>episodic</em> (i.e., one where each layer of reality, having its
own principles, is causally independent of the others), the Principle
of Alien Causality is understood as having a more limited scope. In
this understanding, given that the One and Plurality are taken to be
principles of numbers <em>only</em>, the application of the Principle
of Alien Causality would not extend to <em>all levels of being</em>
but rather be restricted to the relationship that <em>principles of
each level</em> have with <em>what they are principles of</em>. On
this reading, the conclusion of the parallel argument Aristotle
preserves in <em>Metaphysics</em> N, claiming that &ldquo;the One
would not even be a being&rdquo; should be understood as the
conclusion of a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> by Aristotle, rather
than as genuine evidence of Speusippus&rsquo; view (as in Tar&aacute;n
1981: 42).</p>

<p>
The claim that &ldquo;the One is not a being&rdquo; has been central
for those interpretations that saw in Speusippus&rsquo; One an
anticipation of a principle that is beyond being and similar to that
postulated by Neoplatonist authors (see, for instance, Kr&auml;mer
1969, Halfwassen 1992, Bechtle 2010, Dillon 2010, building upon claims
in Dodds 1928). Indeed, scholars found further support for this claim
in William of Moerbeke&rsquo;s Latin translation of part of
Proclus&rsquo; commentary on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em>. In the
Latin text preserved, Proclus tells us that &ldquo;the One is higher
than being and is the source of being&rdquo; and that Indefinite
Duality was later introduced because if the One were &ldquo;in itself,
conceived as separated and alone, without the other things, with no
additional element, nothing else would come into existence&rdquo;.
Most importantly for our purposes, the text claims that this &ldquo;is
also how Speusippus interprets the doctrine of the ancients&rdquo;
(translation by Tar&aacute;n, 1981: 350&ndash;351). The scholarly
community is neatly divided into two groups as to how much the
information that William&rsquo;s translation preserves could be
projected onto Speusippus&rsquo; thought. On the one hand, a
positivistic reading of the data; on this account, Speusippus is the
propounder of a metaphysical/ontological interpretation of the first
two hypotheses of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em>, which antedates
Moderatus&rsquo; interpretation. On the other hand, a skeptical
attitude concerning the information contained in the Latin passage; on
this reading, the text has gone through Neoplatonic or Neopythagorean
reinterpretations and, as such, it does not preserve genuine
information about what Speusippus thought. Determinant for reinforcing
the skeptical attitude towards the material has been an influential
paper by Steel (2002), who pointed out the closeness that the
retroverted text in Greek showed to the formulation of Plato&rsquo;s
second hypothesis in the <em>Parmenides</em>, and claimed that the
text was probably forged in Neopythagorean circles as an attempt to
credit Speusippus with the Neopythagorean concept of a transcendent
One above being and a subordinate Dyad.</p>

<p>
Similarly important for proto-Neoplatonist readings of Speusippus has
been a chapter of the <em>De communi mathematica scientia</em> (<em>On
Mathematical Science in General</em>, hereafter <em>DCMS</em>) by
Iamblichus (3rd century CE) after the case has been made by Merlan
(1953 [1968]) for the idea that chapter IV of <em>DCMS</em> contained
paraphrase if not quotation from Speusippus.</p>

<p>
No doubt chapter IV of Iamblichus&rsquo; <em>DCMS</em> is resonant of
Speusippus&rsquo; theories. Indeed, the text expands on information
that is compatible with what we gather from Aristotle&rsquo;s
testimonia on many points. For instance, it claims that One and
Plurality are the principles of mathematical numbers; a plurality of
principles exist, each pair peculiar to their ontological level; the
absence of beauty and goodness in the principle; the
&lsquo;material&rsquo; principle is not connoted as bad. Yet,
Iamblichus also adds a number of details that are not paralleled
elsewhere. Here, too, the scholarly community has displayed two
opposite attitudes toward the material. For a defense of it, see
Dillon 1984, 2004, and 2012. For a dismissal of it, Tar&aacute;n 1981:
86&ndash;107 and Isnardi Parente 2005
 (<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>),
 who sees at the basis of <em>DCMS</em> IV essentially Aristotelian
reports, where the transcendental aspect of the One has been
accentuated. This is one of those cases where the methodological
choices of the interpreters become critical as they have the effect of
producing radically different depictions of Speusippus.</p>

<p>
We have a fair amount of information about what Speusippus thought
about numbers, preserved in pseudo-Iamblichus&rsquo; <em>Theologumena
arithmeticae</em>. This book is a compilation from various authors:
Anatolius, Nicomachus of Gerasa, possibly Iamblichus himself, possibly
authors unknown. It discusses various properties of each of the first
ten numbers. When it gets to the number 10, the &lsquo;decad&rsquo;,
after a section that looks as if it descends from Nicomachus, it
begins to speak of Speusippus and a book of his which it says was
entitled &lsquo;<em>On Pythagorean Numbers</em>&rsquo; and was
compiled from various Pythagorean writings, especially those of
Philolaus (82.10&ndash;15: that the book had that title and that
Philolaus or any other Pythagorean was a source for Speusippus are
both problematic claims). After what purports to be a description of
the book (82.15&ndash;83.5), it introduces a long quotation from
Speusippus himself concerning the number 10.</p>

<p>
The description preceding the quotation begins (82.20) with a passage
on the first half of Speusippus&rsquo; book, telling us that it talked
about numbers of various types and the five so-called &lsquo;Platonic
solids&rsquo; (the tetrahedron or pyramid, the cube, the octahedron,
the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron, assigned in the Platonic
tradition starting with <em>Timaeus</em> 54d&ndash;56b to the elements
of which the universe was composed and to the universe itself or to
the fifth element, ether). This is relatively unproblematic.</p>

<p>
The second half of the book, the author tells us, was about the number
10. Unfortunately, the description of that half of the book that
precedes the quotation contains wording which it seems impossible to
ascribe to Speusippus. The author tells us that Speusippus showed that
the number 10 was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a sort of artistic form for the cosmic accomplishments, obtaining in
its own right (and not because we use it nor as it happens), and lying
before the god that is maker of the all as an all-complete paradigm.
(<em>DCMS</em> 1975a,b: 83.2&ndash;5; translation by Waterfield 1988:
112)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The trouble is that we have already got Speusippus rejecting the
Theory of Forms, and in particular denying that aspect of the Theory
in which the forms are treated as &lsquo;paradigms&rsquo;: ideal cases
that transmit their properties to things that participate in them.</p>

<p>
As it happens, this passage is too good to be true: it is almost
verbatim what Nicomachus himself wants (see, e.g., Nicomachus&rsquo;
<em>Introductio arithmeticae</em> I vi 1 [1866: 12.1&ndash;12; 1926:
189]). So it seems best not to ascribe it to Speusippus.</p>

<p>
The quotation itself is another matter. In the quotation, Speusippus
tells us that the number 10 is &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; or
&lsquo;complete&rsquo;. The explanation in Euclid vii <em>Def</em>. 23
([1970: 105; <em>Def</em>. 22 in [1926: 278]) for the phrase
&lsquo;perfect number&rsquo; is a &lsquo;number that is the sum of its
proper divisors&rsquo;. This makes the first perfect numbers 6, 28,
and 496: 10 is not a perfect number in this sense.</p>

<p>
Rather, for Speusippus number 10 is <em>perfect</em> because it
exhibits both some characteristics that are peculiar to it, and others
that it itself, insofar as perfect, must display (but are not
exclusive to it). Among the latter kind of qualities, Speusippus lists
that a perfect number must be even (for it must contain an equal
number of odd and even numbers); it must contain an equal number of
first and uncompounded numbers and secondary and compounded numbers
(and number 10 is <em>the first</em> to display this property); it
must contain an equal amount of multiples and submultiples of these
latter. Among the peculiar characteristics that number 10 has we find
that: it displays all arithmetical ratios; it contains all kinds of
numbers (linear, square, and cubic numbers); it displays the first
numerical progression (for how Speusippus understood these
characteristics and examples, see Tar&aacute;n 1981:
257&ndash;298).</p>

<p>
Despite scholars frequently speaking of this text as referring to the
<em>decad</em>, it is crucial to underline that the Greek
&lsquo;<em>dekas&rsquo;</em> occurs in the verbatim quotation one time
only. With the exception of line 50, Speusippus consistently refers to
10 as: &lsquo;<em>ta deka&rsquo;, ho deka [arithmos]</em>,
&ldquo;&iota;&#697;&rdquo;, <em>ho t&#333;n deka arithmos</em>, or in
other words, he consistently emphasizes its <em>numerical</em> aspect.
And the same occurs with all other numbers mentioned. More precisely:
in the section discussing the characteristics of 10, Speusippus
regularly refers to numbers as cardinals. It is in the subsequent
section of the text, when Speusippus explains the composition of
figures to show how, when enumerating their elements, our count always
reaches 10, that the language changes and we find terms like
&lsquo;<em>duas</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>tetras</em>&rsquo;;
&lsquo;<em>exas</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>dekas</em>&rsquo;. The
reason why Speusippus here uses terms such as &lsquo;dyad&rsquo;,
&lsquo;tetrad&rsquo;, &lsquo;hexad&rsquo;, and &lsquo;decad&rsquo; is
precisely because he is referring to <em>groups</em> of 2, 3, 4, 6, or
10 objects. This aspect has been overlooked by studies on the text,
probably inadvertently influenced by the metaphysical summary.</p>

<p>
One important result one gathers from the properties that Speusippus
ascribes to 10 is that he seems to have supposed that number 1 was
among the numbers. In this, he was apparently ahead of his time, for
the generally accepted view was that 1 is not a number (for this see
Aristotle, <em>Metaphysics</em>, book &Iota;; Euclid,
<em>Elements</em> vii def. 2, proof of prop. 1, et passim). But if
this is so, it is essential to recall that we are dealing with
Aristotle&rsquo;s &lsquo;mathematical&rsquo; numbers, where there is a
plurality for each number. So there is a plurality of numbers 1 (so
that we can add 1 and 1 to get 2, etc.). Then the One is not the
number 1; the latter comes about when you get a plurality of units,
any of which counts as a 1, any couple of which counts as a 2, and so
on. That the One is not the number 1 is only what we should expect,
given the Principle of Alien Causality: the principle for numbers is
not itself a number.</p>

<p>
When we try to consider Speusippus&rsquo; views as they bear on the
other levels of his universe, unfortunately, we have virtually nothing
further to tell us what is going on: nothing that tells us what could
be going on at the level of soul, or perceptible bodies. A passage in
Stobaeus (<em>Eclogues</em> I 49.32 [1884: 364.2&ndash;7]) that
apparently descends from Iamblichus&rsquo; <em>De anima</em> tells us
that he defined the soul &lsquo;by the extended in every
dimension&rsquo;, but this claim remains elusive (for recent attempts
to understand the definition, see Opsomer 2020 and De Cesaris
2022).</p>

<h2 id="Epi">3. Epistemology</h2>

<p>
Aristotle says, in <em>Posterior Analytics</em> II 13.
97a6&ndash;11:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is no need for one who is defining and dividing to know all the
things that are. And yet some say that it is impossible to know the
differences between something and each other thing while one does not
know each other thing, and without the differences one cannot know
each thing, for a thing is the same as that from which it does not
differ, and it is other than that from which it differs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ancient commentators (see esp. Anonymous <em>In An. post</em>.
584.17&ndash;585.2, where the ascription is credited to Eudemus) tell
us that this is Speusippus&rsquo; position (it has antecedents in
Plato, <em>Philebus</em> 18c and <em>Theaetetus</em> 208c-e).</p>

<p>
It is a version of what is sometimes called &lsquo;holism&rsquo;:
knowing something involves knowing where it is located among
everything else. In this particular context, knowing a thing appears
to be a matter of knowing its definition, and its definition is
something arrived at by the Platonic method of division (there is room
for controversy here: see Falcon 2000). An example suggested by what
Aristotle says elsewhere in this same chapter (96a24-b1, much
simplified) might be an attempt to define the number 3 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(D<sub>triad</sub>) a triad =<sub>df</sub> a number, odd, prime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We reach this definition by successive divisions:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="a diagram of the form (number (odd (prime (triad)) (composite)) (even))" class="nocaption" src="figure1.svg" style="width:250px" title="Figure 1" />
</div>

<p>
And then the view being ascribed to Speusippus is that knowing the
number 3 is knowing where 3 is on such a grid, along with knowing
where every other number on the grid is.</p>

<p>
It is very difficult to imagine sustaining this epistemological
holism. It might seem easier if we confined the view to things like
mathematics. But we already know that Speusippus&rsquo; universe
extended beyond the realm of mathematical objects, and it seems quite
likely that another division suggested by Aristotle in that chapter
(96b30&ndash;35) would be acceptable (at least in principle) to
Speusippus:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="a diagram of the form (animal (tame (footed (two-footed (man)) (four-footed)) (winged) (swimming)) (wild))" class="nocaption" src="figure2.svg" style="width:500px" title="figure 2" />
</div>

<p>
The difficulty of sustaining the idea that knowing <em>man</em> is a
matter of knowing its position on a tree that locates absolutely every
animal, or even every ensouled thing, or (worse yet) absolutely
everything, is enormous. But it looks as if Speusippus would have been
committed to this.</p>

<p>
For we find this in Sextus Empiricus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; but Speusippus said that, since of things some are
perceptible and others intelligible, the criterion of the intelligible
ones is the scientific account, and that of the perceptible ones is
the scientific perception. Scientific perception he understood to be
that which partakes of the truth in accordance with the account. For
just as the fingers of the flautist or harpist have an artistic
actuality, yet one that is not completed in them in the first
instance, but perfected on the basis of discipline conforming to
reasoning, and as the perception of the musician has an actuality that
can grasp what is in tune and what is out of tune, and this is not
self-grown but comes about on the basis of reasoning, so also the
scientific perception partakes of its scientific practice as naturally
derived from the account, leading to the unerring discrimination of
the subjects. (<em>Adversus mathematicos</em> vii 145&ndash;146 [1935:
80, 81])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The use of the word &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; should not lead one away
from the main point: it translates a word that means &lsquo;pertaining
to knowledge&rsquo;, and Speusippus is claiming that there is
knowledge at the level of perceived objects. There is no indication
that he gave up his holism at this point. So he seems to be committed
to defending a rather drastic position.</p>

<p>
And he seems to have pursued knowledge at the level of perceived
objects with considerable zeal. We have book-titles such as
<em>Definitions</em> and <em>Likes</em> in which Speusippus apparently
attempted with some zeal to locate various species of plants and
animals on something like a division-tree, although the details are
not extant. What we hear about Speusippus&rsquo; efforts is, for
example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
MARSHWORTS: Speusippus in book II of <em>Likes</em> says they grow in
water, their leaf resembling marsh celery. (Athenaeus II 61c [1927:
266, 267])</p>

<p>
Speusippus in the <em>Likes</em> calls the melon a
&lsquo;gourd&rsquo;. (Athenaeus II 68e [1927: 298, 299])</p>

<p>
Speusippus in book II of <em>Likes</em> says that trumpet-shells,
purple-fish, snails, and clams are similar. &hellip; Again, Speusippus
enumerates next in order, in a separate division, clams, scallops,
mussels, pinnas, razorfish, and in another class oysters, limpets.
(Athenaeus III 86c,d [1927: 372, 273])</p>

<p>
Speusippus in book II of <em>Likes</em> says that, of the soft-shells,
the crayfish, lobster, mollusc, bear-crab, crab, <em>paguros</em> are
similar. (Athenaeus III 105b [1927: 450, 451])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are a total of twenty-five such citations in Athenaeus. Most
simply record that Speusippus said one organism was like another (as
with the last two), or simply record differences of terminology that
happened to catch Athenaeus&rsquo; eye (as with the second one). The
only one that promises anything more is the first one above, and that
hardly promises much. But it has been supposed (see Tar&aacute;n 1981)
that it implies that Speusippus differentiated species of animals on
the basis of features that would not have counted as differentiae in
Aristotle&rsquo;s way of classifying animals: differences of locale.
And it is certainly possible that Speusippus&rsquo; holism involved a
rejection of Aristotle&rsquo;s essence-accident distinction: if we
take the text quoted above from Aristotle as implying that someone who
knows marshworts must know every respect in which they are like or
unlike every other organism in the universe, and every such
differentiating feature is as good as any other in defining them, then
we have abandoned the project of differentiating organisms as it
appeared to Aristotle.</p>

<p>
This line of thought has suggested to some (see Tar&aacute;n 1981)
that the criticism of the Method of Division in Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Parts of Animals</em> I 2&ndash;3 constitutes a criticism of
Speusippus. This possibility remains highly controversial.</p>

<p>
It appears from Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
Categories</em> ([1907: 38.19&ndash;24]) that Speusippus applied his
method of division, however it worked, to language: there we hear of a
division of terms even more elaborate than Aristotle&rsquo;s in the
opening chapter of the <em>Categories</em>: there we hear of homonyms,
synonyms, and paronyms, but Speusippus differentiated between
tautonyms (uses of the same term), within which there are homonyms
(same term but different definitions) and synonyms (same term and same
definition), and heteronyms (different terms), within which there are
heteronyms proper (different names, different things), polyonyms (many
names, the same thing), and paronyms (as in Aristotle: different terms
and different things, with one term derivative from another, as
&lsquo;courageous&rsquo; and &lsquo;courage&rsquo;). Whether this
classification was not only more elaborate than Aristotle&rsquo;s, but
also had a different basis (that in Aristotle being a classification
of things according to how they are referred to, that in Speusippus
being a classification of terms themselves), is in dispute (Barnes
1971, Tar&aacute;n 1978).</p>

<p>
Finally, a little bit about Speusippus&rsquo; attitude toward the
epistemology of mathematics is preserved by Proclus. Assuming that
Aristotle in <em>Metaphysics</em> N 3, 1090a25&ndash;29, 35-b1 is
discussing Speusippus (he is talking about &ldquo;those who say there
is only the mathematical number&rdquo;), Speusippus held that the
truths of mathematics are not about perceptible things, and that the
axioms from which they follow &ldquo;fawn on the soul&rdquo;: that is,
perhaps, suggest themselves. Proclus adds the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For universally, Speusippus says, of the things for which the
understanding is making a hunt, some it puts forward without having
made an elaborate excursion, and sets them up for the investigation to
come: it has a clearer contact with these, even more than sight has
with visible things; but with others, which it is unable to grasp
straight off, but against which it makes its strides by inference, it
tries to effect their capture along the lines of what follows.
(<em>Commentary on Book I of Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</em> [1873:
179.8&ndash;22; 1970: 141])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we begin from some sort of intuition by which the axioms suggest
themselves and proceed from them to the rest of the mathematical
truths.</p>

<p>
We also hear from Proclus of a dispute in the Academy between some,
whom we might call &lsquo;constructivists&rsquo;, who saw mathematics
as something like a human construct, and referred to the truths of
geometry as &lsquo;problems&rsquo;, demanding geometrical
constructions, and others, whom we might think of as
&lsquo;mathematical realists&rsquo;, who saw mathematics as describing
an eternal, unchanging realm of objects, and referred to the truths of
mathematics as &lsquo;theorems&rsquo; or &lsquo;objects of
contemplation&rsquo;. Proclus says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But already among the ancients, some demanded that we call all of the
things that follow from the principles theorems, as did Speusippus,
Amphinomus, and those around them, thinking that for the theoretical
branches of knowledge the appellation &lsquo;theorems&rsquo; was more
appropriate than &lsquo;problems&rsquo;, especially in that they make
their accounts about eternal things. For there is no coming-to-be
among the eternal things, so that the problem could have no place with
them, it requiring a coming-to-be and making of that which was not
before, e.g. constructing an equilateral triangle or describing a
square when a line is given, or placing a line at a given point. So
they say it is better to say that all these things are, but that we
look at their comings-to-be not by way of producing them but by way of
knowing them, treating the things that always are as if they were
coming-to-be. (<em>Commentary on Book I of Euclid&rsquo;s
Elements</em> [1873: 77.15&ndash;78.6; 1970: 63&ndash;64])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So Speusippus, as we might have predicted from the foregoing, was
firmly in the realist camp.</p>

<h2 id="Eth">4. Ethics</h2>

<p>
Speusippus certainly wrote about ethics: the bibliography in Diogenes
lists (in <em>Lives</em> IV 4) one book each on wealth, pleasure,
justice, and friendship. But we have nothing that can be properly
called a fragment.</p>

<p>
We have already seen that Speusippus rejected Plato&rsquo;s Theory of
Forms, and that he refused to place the good among the metaphysical
first principles. So he was not obviously prone to the objections of
Aristotle against Platonic ethics in <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> I 6,
the general upshot of which is that Plato&rsquo;s theory puts the Good
out of human reach.</p>

<p>
Speusippus appears to have adopted a rather down-to-earth goal, and in
this he is a lead-in to Hellenistic concerns. Hellenistic ethics is
dominated by the identification of the ideal of human happiness as
&lsquo;undisturbedness&rsquo; (<em>ataraxia</em>). According to
Clement, <em>Stromata</em> II 22, 133 [1939: 186.19&ndash;23]):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Speusippus, Plato&rsquo;s nephew, says that happiness is the completed
state in things that hold by nature, or possession of goods, for which
condition all men have desire, while the good ones aim at
untroubledness (<em>aochlesia</em>). And the excellences are
productive of happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These formulations &lsquo;anticipate&rsquo; Stoic and Epicurean ones:
the emphasis on &lsquo;natural&rsquo; conditions is a feature of
Stoicism, and the notion of &lsquo;untroubledness&rsquo; is found in
Epicurus (see <em>To Menoeceus</em>, in Diogenes Laertius
<em>Lives</em> X 127).</p>

<p>
There is an argument implicit in the clause &ldquo;for which all men
have desire, while the good ones aim at untroubledness&rdquo; that
fits in perfectly with a debate about the good and happiness that we
know from Aristotle to have been current in the Academy, and in which
Speusippus played a leading role. <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> X 2
begins (1172b9&ndash;10):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Eudoxus, then, thought pleasure to be the good because he saw all
things, both rational and irrational, aiming at it, &hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This sort of &lsquo;Universal Pursuit Argument&rsquo; is one that
became very popular in the Hellenistic period; here we have Eudoxus
applying it in favor of the claim that pleasure is the good:
&lsquo;hedonism&rsquo; (for more on the discussion between Eudoxus and
Speusippus, see Warren 2009, Cheng 2020a and 2020b). And Speusippus
strenuously denied hedonism (see below).</p>

<p>
We might, then, see Speusippus responding to the Universal Pursuit
Argument construed as favoring hedonism by saying: we should not care
about what all things in general aim at, but at what <em>human
beings</em> aim at, in fact, more specifically, the <em>good</em> ones
among them, and what human beings pursue is not pleasure, but the
completed state in things that hold by nature, and the <em>good</em>
ones, more specifically, pursue untroubledness. The word
&lsquo;untroubledness&rsquo;, <em>aochlesia</em>, comes from a verb
<em>ochleein</em> that can just mean &lsquo;to move&rsquo;, so
untroubledness might well suggest a certain stillness, lack of motion.
This will fit with Speusippus&rsquo; views on pleasure and pain.</p>

<p>
Before we turn to those, we have a little more with which to flesh out
Speusippus&rsquo; idea of the good for man; none of it, regrettably,
is supplied with argument.</p>

<p>
Cicero, in various places, ascribes a view to &ldquo;Aristotle,
Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon&rdquo; which he himself rejects.
In the <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> he enumerates (V X 29) various
things such as poverty, ingloriousness, loneliness, pain, ill health,
etc., which many people (but not he: his own view is the Stoic one
that virtue all by itself guarantees happiness) take to be bad things,
and then says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Therefore I do not easily give in to &hellip; those ancients,
Aristotle, Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon, since they count the
things I have enumerated above among the bad things, and these very
people say that the wise man is always happy. (V X 30 [1927:
454/455&ndash;456/457])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cicero is, in the last clause, accusing these people of inconsistency:
they think the wise man is always happy, and yet they think there are
things such as wealth and health the lack of which would bring about
unhappiness.</p>

<p>
Seneca says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Xenocrates and Speusippus think that one can become happy even by
virtue alone, but not that there is one good, that is morality
(<em>honestum</em>). (<em>Epistulae morales</em> 85.18 [1965: I.292;
1920: 294, 295])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This can be seen as expressive of the same reservation Cicero had. If
Speusippus and Xenocrates espoused the view that the virtuous man was
always happy but thought that there were non-moral evils such as
poverty and pain, then they thought that there were non-moral good
things as well: the absence of poverty and the absence of pain. So (on
Cicero&rsquo;s and Seneca&rsquo;s account) they were not consistent in
maintaining that virtue (which incorporates only moral goods) was
sufficient for happiness.</p>

<p>
And it appears that Speusippus and Xenocrates did think that there
were non-moral goods; Plutarch, in <em>De communibus notitiis adversus
Stoicos</em> 13. 1065a [1976: 704, 705]) refers to Speusippus and
Xenocrates as &ldquo;thinking that health is not indifferent and
wealth not useless&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
We are left with two views to ascribe to Speusippus (and to
Xenocrates): that wisdom, or virtue in general, is sufficient for
happiness, and that there are non-moral goods the lack of which
conduces to unhappiness. Cicero&rsquo;s question as to how these can
be rendered consistent is a good one, and we have no information about
how Speusippus might have answered it.</p>

<p>
Let us turn to the one other topic about which we have some purchase
on Speusippus&rsquo; ethical views, that of pleasure:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Speusippus and the entire old Academy say that pleasure and pain are
two evils opposed to each other, but that the good is what is in the
middle between the two. (Aulus Gellius, <em>Atticae noctes</em> IX v 4
[1968: 284; 1927: 168, 169])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The inclusion of the rest of the Academy along with Speusippus is
presumably due to the influence of Cicero&rsquo;s teacher
Antiochus&rsquo; unifying efforts. At any rate, there is confirmation
that this was Speusippus&rsquo; view, from two passages in
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>: VII 13, which names
Speusippus, and X 2. 1173a5&ndash;13, which does not, but repeats the
argument of the former passage.</p>

<p>
In the first of those chapters (in 1153b1&ndash;7) Aristotle mentions
Speusippus as having attacked the claim that pleasure is something
good. He had canvassed arguments to the effect that pleasure is a bad
thing earlier in the chapter, and some of the arguments certainly
sound like Speusippus (1152b12&ndash;20):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And so, in favor of the claim that pleasure is not a good at all, it
is argued (1) that every pleasure is a perceptible coming-to-be toward
a natural state, while no coming-to-be is of the same kind as its
ends, e.g. no house-building is of the same kind as a house. (2)
Again, the temperate man avoids pleasures. (3) Again, the intelligent
man pursues what is painless, not what is pleasant. (4) Again,
pleasures are a hindrance to reflecting, and by as much as one enjoys
them, by that much are they more of a hindrance, as with the pleasure
of sex; for no one could think in the course of that. (5) Again, there
is no art of pleasure, although everything good is the work of an art.
(6) Again, children and wild animals pursue pleasures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Assuming that we correctly understood Speusippus&rsquo; response to
the Universal Pursuit Argument, (2), (3), and (6) are consonant with
that response.</p>

<p>
But (1) plainly echoes material in Plato&rsquo;s <em>Philebus</em>
(see esp. 53c&ndash;55a). And that leads to the interesting suggestion
that in that dialogue Plato is entering the dispute between Eudoxus
and Speusippus. It has been suggested independently of that passage
that Speusippus is lurking behind the &lsquo;harsh thinkers&rsquo;,
the anti-hedonists, of 44a&ndash;47b (Schofield 1971; Dillon
1996).</p>

<p>
If that is right, and if Graeser&rsquo;s suggestion that Plato in the
<em>Parmenides</em> is responding to some of Speusippus&rsquo;
metaphysical views (Graeser 1997, 1999; see also Halfwassen 1993), it
is plain that the understanding of some of what is going on in late
Plato would be aided by an understanding of what was going on in
Speusippus. The loss of his writings is regrettable indeed.</p>
