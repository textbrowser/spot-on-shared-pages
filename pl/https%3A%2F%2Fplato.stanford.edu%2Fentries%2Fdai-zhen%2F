<h1>Dai Zhen</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri May 2, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Dai Zhen &#25140;&#38663; (1724&ndash;1777), also known by his
courtesy name Dai Dongyuan &#25140;&#26481;&#21407;, was a highly
accomplished scholar of the Qianlong-Jiaqing era of the Qing dynasty.
His expertise encompassed a wide range of fields, including philology,
phonology, mathematics, astronomy, ancient institutions, geography,
chorography, and philosophy. Although his contributions to other
disciplines were recognized during his lifetime, his philosophy was
not widely acknowledged. Despite this, his ideas significantly
influenced philosophically-minded interpreters of the Confucian
<em>Analects</em> and the <em>Mencius</em>, notably Jiao Xun
&#28966;&#24490; (1763&ndash;1820), who frequently referenced
Dai&rsquo;s works in his influential book, <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Mengzi
Zhengyi</em>
&#23391;&#23376;&#27491;&#32681; (<em>The Correct Meaning of the
Mencius</em>). In the early twentieth century, prominent intellectuals
such as Zhang Taiyan &#31456;&#22826;&#28814; (1869&ndash;1936), Liu
Shipei &#21129;&#24107;&#22521; (1884&ndash;1919), Liang Qichao
&#26753;&#21855;&#36229; (1873&ndash;1929), and Hu Shi
&#32993;&#36969; (1891&ndash;1962) revived interest in Dai&rsquo;s
ideas. Since then, Dai has been widely regarded as the premier
ethical, psychological, and metaphysical thinker of the mid-Qing
dynasty.</p>

<p>
Dai argued that some of his influential predecessors in the Confucian
tradition of the Song (960&ndash;1279) and Ming (1368&ndash;1644)
dynasties, such as Zhu Xi, had in fact misunderstood the metaphysics
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> &#36947; (the Way) and its
constituent patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;) and
accordingly failed to grasp the ethical status of mundane
psychological states such as wants and feelings. These errors led in
turn to a misguided understanding of moral epistemology and of the
process of personal ethical cultivation. For Dai, <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
does not lie in abstract, transcendent
patterns that can be realized by an appropriately clear, unsullied
mind. Instead, pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
are inherent in concrete objects and
everyday life, to be found in everyday activities such as
&ldquo;eating and drinking&rdquo;. They are simply the appropriate
order or pattern of organization of the concrete, everyday world,
which can be discovered through detailed investigation based on
evidence. Since patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) are
inherent in everyday life, it was an error for some Song and Ming
thinkers to treat sensory desires as an obstacle to understanding and
moral development. Desires or wants are an integral part of our
psychology, and our shared ordinary feelings can actually be used as a
guide to identifying patterns. Drawing on his encyclopedic
philological knowledge of early Chinese texts, Dai employed meticulous
exegesis of classical sources to argue that many of his
predecessors&rsquo; purported errors stemmed from a faulty
understanding of the classics. In many cases, in Dai&rsquo;s view,
their interpretations reflected a Daoist or Buddhist outlook, rather
than what he regarded as a genuinely Confucian stance.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="LifWri">1. Life and Writings</h2>

<p>
Dai came from a poor family in Xiuning &#20241;&#23527; county, Anhui
&#23433;&#24509; province. Because of his family&rsquo;s financial
constraints, Dai did not have the opportunity to study under renowned
scholars during his youth. Although he attended a private school, his
teacher could not provide satisfactory answers to his questions about
the meaning of the terms in the classical texts. Instead, his teacher
gave him dictionaries and encouraged him to continue his studies
independently. Finding these dictionaries inadequate, Dai borrowed a
set of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shisanjing Zhushu</em>
&#21313;&#19977;&#32147;&#27880;&#30095; (<em>Commentaries on the
Thirteen Classics</em>) from a friend. According to Dai&rsquo;s own
account, at the age of 17 (by traditional Chinese reckoning, or in
1739), he developed his lifelong ambition to understand the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
(the right way or path of life) of the
ancient sages and devised a methodology he pursued throughout his
life: the chief means of understanding the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
is through comprehending ancient texts,
he held, and to comprehend the texts thoroughly, it is necessary to
understand the import of the terms in them. Such an understanding is
in turn impossible without knowledge of classical institutions,
terminology, and tools. Dai states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="avoid-break" lang="zh-Hant">
&#32147;&#20043;&#33267;&#32773;&#36947;&#20063;&#65292;&#25152;&#20197;&#26126;&#36947;&#32773;&#20854;&#35422;&#20063;&#65292;&#25152;&#20197;&#25104;&#35422;&#32773;&#23383;&#20063;&#12290;&#30001;&#23383;&#20197;&#36890;&#20854;&#35422;&#65292;&#30001;&#35422;&#20197;&#36890;&#20854;&#36947;&#65292;&#24517;&#26377;&#28472;&#12290;&#65288;&#12296;&#33287;&#26159;&#20210;&#26126;&#35542;&#23416;&#26360;&#12297;&#65289;</p>

<p>
What the classics are getting at is the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>;
they explain the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
through their phrases; they form
phrases through words. If we seek to comprehend the phrases through
the words and the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> through the
phrases, we will surely make progress. (DZQS 6,
 368)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
In a letter to his student Duan Yucai &#27573;&#29577;&#35009;
(1735&ndash;1815), Dai explained his ambition as a scholar:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="avoid-break" lang="zh-Hant">
&#20693;&#33258;&#21313;&#19971;&#27506;&#26178;&#65292;&#26377;&#24535;&#32862;&#36947;&#65292;&#35586;&#38750;&#27714;&#20043;&#20845;&#32147;&#12289;&#23380;&#12289;&#23391;&#19981;&#24471;&#65292;&#38750;&#24478;&#20107;&#26044;&#23383;&#32681;&#12289;&#21046;&#24230;&#12289;&#21517;&#29289;&#65292;&#28961;&#30001;&#20197;&#36890;&#20854;&#35486;&#35328;&#12290;&#65288;&#12296;&#33287;&#27573;&#33538;&#22530;&#31561;&#21313;&#19968;&#26413;&#12297;&#65289;</p>

<p>
Since the age of seventeen, I have aspired to learn the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>,
contending that it cannot be attained
without seeking it in the Six Classics, Confucius, and Mencius and
that without researching the import of words, the structure of
institutions, and the terminology for various things there is no way
to comprehend the language [of these texts]. (DZQS 6, 531)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dai thus established his methodology for understanding the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of the ancient sages before the age of
20 (or in 1742), when he met Jiang Yong &#27743;&#27704;
(1681&ndash;1762), a renowned scholar specializing in the <em>Three
Ritual Classics</em> and an expert in calendrical studies,
mathematics, and phonology, who later became his teacher (Cai 2006:
3&ndash;27). Before turning 30 (in 1752), Dai completed several
original works in philology, mathematics, phonology, and classical
commentary. The most notable of these were <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Kaogongjitu</em>
&#32771;&#24037;&#35352;&#22294; (<em>Illustrated Research on
Artisans&rsquo; Records</em>) and his initial emendations of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shujingzhu</em>
&#27700;&#32147;&#27880;
(<em>Commentaries on the Water Classic</em>). In the former, he
created precise diagrams of the ancient tools discussed in the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Kaogongji</em>
&#32771;&#24037;&#35352;
(<em>Research on Artisans&rsquo; Records</em>) of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Zhouli</em>
&#21608;&#31150; (<em>The Rites of
Zhou</em>). Later archaeological discoveries confirmed the accuracy of
some of Dai&rsquo;s illustrations. During Dai&rsquo;s lifetime, an
ancient bell was discovered that matched an illustration in his work
(DZQS 7, 187). In his work on the <em>Water Classic</em>, Dai
attempted to distinguish the canonical text of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shuijing</em>
from its commentaries (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">zhu</em>
&#27880;). Because the two had been
intermingled in transmission, the text of the <em>Water Classic</em>
had become incomprehensible. Dai&rsquo;s initial emendations provided
new insights into reading the text. When he arrived at the capital in
1754, these early achievements earned him attention and recognition
among renowned scholar-officials, such as Ji Yun &#32000;&#26112;
(1724&ndash;1805), Qian Daxin &#37666;&#22823;&#26133;
(1728&ndash;1804), and Zhu Yun &#26417;&#31584; (1729&ndash;1781)
(DZQS 7, 144&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Dai Zhen began writing <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yuan Shan</em>
&#21407;&#21892;, a philosophical work in three essays, in 1753 and
continued revising it for over 10 years. He later expressed to Duan
Yucai that he was thrilled upon completing the first essay (DZQS 7,
153). This excitement was at odds with the academic climate of the
time, which deprecated philosophical inquiry in favor of studies based
on evidence and facts, such as philology, phonology, geography,
astronomy, mathematics, and history. These fields were highly valued
and heavily researched in the Qing dynasty, as part of a movement
known as &ldquo;evidential learning&rdquo; or &ldquo;learning based on
examination of evidence&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">kaozhengxue</em>
&#32771;&#35657;&#23416;). By
contrast, philosophy was considered too speculative, partly as a
result of the perceived excesses of Song- and Ming-dynasty thought. In
response to criticism that his <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yuan
Shan</em> essays were &ldquo;empty talk&rdquo;, Dai expanded them into
a book by adding citations from the classics and classical
commentaries to support his interpretations. Despite this effort, he
felt frustrated by the negative reception and chose not to publish the
book, even when it was completed in 1766 (DZQS 6, 7). Instead, he
circulated it among a select few acquaintances, possibly including
Zhang Xuecheng &#31456;&#23416;&#35488; (1738&ndash;1801), an
up-and-coming young scholar who visited him that year. According to
Zhang, he was shocked and intimidated by Dai&rsquo;s claims about his
contemporaries&rsquo; methodologically incompetent understanding of
classical texts. Zhang was among the few who were sympathetic to and
influenced by Dai&rsquo;s philosophical thought. As was the case with
Dai&rsquo;s work, Zhang&rsquo;s philosophy, particularly his approach
to the philosophy of history, was not fully appreciated until the
early twentieth century (see Yu 1996 and 2016).</p>

<p>
Dai passed the provincial civil service examination in 1762 at the age
of 40, finally qualifying him to take the metropolitan examination
held every three years in the capital. From 1763 to 1775, he failed
the metropolitan examination five consecutive times. Nevertheless, his
reputation as a leading evidential scholar and his friendships with
prominent scholar-officials earned him a position as an editor in the
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Sikuguan</em> &#22235;&#24235;&#39208;
(&ldquo;Office of the Four Storehouses&rdquo;), established in 1772 to
fulfill the Qianlong Emperor&rsquo;s decree to compile a comprehensive
library of all valuable publications. Despite failing in the
metropolitan exam for the fifth time in 1775, his contributions at the
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Sikuguan</em>, especially his emendation of
the <em>Commentaries on the Water Classic</em>, led the emperor to
award him a <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shujishi</em>
&#24246;&#21513;&#22763; degree independently of the examination
results. (The <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shujishi</em> was a three-year
trainee position in the Hanlin Imperial Academy, which was a
prerequisite for central government service.) Unfortunately,
Dai&rsquo;s health soon declined, partly due to overwork at the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Sikuguan</em>,
and because of medical
malpractice he died unexpectedly in 1777 at the age of 55.</p>

<p>
Before his unexpected death, Dai completed what he considered his
greatest work, the philosophical masterpiece <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Mengzi
Ziyi Shuzheng</em>
&#23391;&#23376;&#23383;&#32681;&#30095;&#35657; (<em>Evidential
Commentary on the Meaning of Terms in the Mencius</em>). He spent over
a decade revising this book, possibly starting around 1765 or 1766,
when he feigned illness to take leave and draft the first version.
Various early drafts were circulated among his friends and associates,
resulting in many different versions. For instance, Dai&rsquo;s <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xuyan</em>
&#32210;&#35328; (<em>Prologue</em>)
is believed to be one of the early drafts of the <em>Evidential
Commentary</em>. Dai&rsquo;s dedication to revising this work stemmed
from a writing principle he adopted from Fang Muru
&#26041;&#26968;&#22914;: &ldquo;Being good at composing is not as
good as being good at revising, and being good at revising is not as
good as being good at deleting&rdquo; (DZQS 7, 204). The
<em>Evidential Commentary</em> was meant to be part of an ambitious
project Dai was unable to finish, to be called <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Qijing

&#19971;&#32147;&#23567;&#35352; (<em>Remarks on the Seven
Classics</em>). The &ldquo;seven classics&rdquo; referred to the
<em>Odes</em> (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shi</em> &#35433;),
<em>Documents</em> (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shu</em> &#26360;),
<em>Rites</em> (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Li</em> &#31150;),
<em>Changes</em> (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yi</em> &#26131;),
<em>Annals</em> (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Chunqiu</em>
&#26149;&#31179;), <em>Analects</em>, and <em>Mencius</em>, which Dai
believed jointly conveyed the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. The
<em>Remarks</em> was to be divided into five parts, approaching the
seven classics from five perspectives, namely</p>

<ul>

<li><em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xugupian</em> &#35347;&#35393;&#31687;
(containing works in philology and phonology),</li>

<li><em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yuanxiangpian</em>
&#21407;&#35937;&#31687; (mathematics and astronomy),</li>

<li><em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xuelipian</em> &#23416;&#31150;&#31687;
(rituals and institutions),</li>

<li><em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shuidipian</em> &#27700;&#22320;&#31687;
(geography and chorography), and</li>

<li><em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yuanshanpian</em>
&#21407;&#21892;&#31687; (philosophy, construed primarily as ethics
and metaethics).</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of Dai&rsquo;s works can be categorized into these five areas. For
example, his <em>Illustrated Research on Artisans&rsquo; Records</em>
fits under the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xuelipian</em>, his
<em>Commentaries on the Water Classic</em> belong under <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Shuidipian</em>,
and his <em>Evidential
Commentary on the Meaning of Terms of the Mencius</em> falls under <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yuanshanpian</em>.
The relationship between
these five areas can be inferred from Dai&rsquo;s methodology, by
which evidential learning is the means to discover the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>.
Research in the first four areas
serves as the foundation for work in the fifth
 (philosophy).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="SixClaConDao">2. &ldquo;The Six Classics Convey the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;The Six Classics convey the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Liujing zaidao</em>
&#20845;&#32147;&#36617;&#36947;)&rdquo; is a thesis accepted by all
Confucians, although different thinkers interpret it differently (for
convenience, we&rsquo;ll refer to this as the &ldquo;Conveyance
Thesis&rdquo;). (The Six Classics are the <em>Classic of Change,</em>
the <em>Documents,</em> the <em>Odes,</em> the <em>Rites,</em> the
<em>Music</em>, and the <em>Annals</em>.) Dai&rsquo;s understanding of
this thesis is reflected in his lifelong methodology. As shown in the
letter to Duan Yucai quoted above, his stance is that study of the Six
Classics is a necessary prerequisite for grasping the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>.
In the letter, Dai ranks the
<em>Analects</em> of Confucius and the <em>Mencius</em> on the same
level as the Six Classics in importance (the importance of these two
books is also reflected in the name of his <em>Remarks on the Seven
Classics</em>). We will return to this point below. First, let&rsquo;s
explore the Conveyance Thesis. Dai writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#23435;&#20754;&#35663;&#35347;&#35393;&#20043;&#23416;&#65292;&#36629;&#35486;&#35328;&#25991;&#23383;&#65292;&#26159;&#27442;&#28193;&#27743;&#32780;&#26820;&#33311;&#26987;&#65292;&#27442;&#30331;&#39640;&#32780;&#28961;&#38542;&#26799;&#20063;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Song dynasty scholars ridiculed the study of philology, dismissing the
importance of language and written characters. This is akin to wanting
to cross a river without using a boat and paddle or to climbing a
height without using a ladder. (DZQS 6, 531)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dai&rsquo;s interpretation of the Conveyance Thesis is that studying
the Six Classics is a necessary means for understanding the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>,
because any purported account of the
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> must be shown to conform to the
content of the Six Classics. He repeatedly criticizes earlier thinkers
for their failure to conform to &ldquo;the Six Classics, Confucius,
and Mencius&rdquo; (see, for example, DZQS 6, 167, 168, 176, and 203).
The opposing view would be that studying the Six Classics is
<em>not</em> necessary. This opposing view does not necessarily reject
a weaker version of the Conveyance Thesis, as there could be more than
one way to discover the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. For
example, perhaps someone might argue for a self-discovery view,
according to which the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> can be
discovered directly from within one&rsquo;s own heart-mind. (The Ming
thinker Wang Yangming&rsquo;s position is probably a version of a
self-discovery view.) However, a self-discovery view faces the
challenge of establishing that the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
discovered from the heart-mind is indeed the same as the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of the Six Classics. For Dai, the Six
Classics have the last word in this matter.</p>

<p>
As Dai sees it, the primary issue here is epistemological. Scholars
can claim to grasp the Confucian sages&rsquo; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>,
but this claim needs verification. The
Conveyance Thesis entails that the Six Classics are authoritative in
verifying whether one&rsquo;s understanding of the sages&rsquo; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
is correct. It is important to ask how
thoroughly one must understand the Six Classics to establish the claim
that the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> one grasps is the same as
the sages&rsquo;. For example, the Cheng brothers&mdash;two
influential Song-dynasty thinkers&mdash;famously claim:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#23416;&#32773;&#30070;&#20197;&#35542;&#35486;&#23391;&#23376;&#28858;&#26412;&#12290;&#35542;&#35486;&#23391;&#23376;&#26082;&#27835;&#65292;&#21063;&#20845;&#32147;&#21487;&#19981;&#27835;&#32780;&#26126;&#30691;&#12290;&#65288;&#12298;&#22235;&#26360;&#31456;&#21477;&#38598;&#27880;&#12299;&#12296;&#35712;&#35542;&#35486;&#23391;&#23376;&#27861;&#12297;&#65289;</p>

<p>
Scholars should take the <em>Analects</em> and <em>Mencius</em> as
their foundation. Once the <em>Analects</em> and <em>Mencius</em> are
well-studied, then the Six Classics can be understood clearly without
further study. (Zhu <em>SZJ</em>: 44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Cheng brothers do not deny the Conveyance Thesis, but in its
application, Dai is far more demanding than they are. For Dai, a
complete understanding of each character in the Six Classics is
necessary to grasp the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. One might
object that philology alone cannot settle interpretive issues. Even
when we understand the meanings of the terms, multiple interpretations
of a text may remain possible. Dai would likely accept this point. He
needs to insist only that all philosophical interpretations must be
consistent with some plausible philological interpretation.</p>

<p>
This verification problem was already recognized in the Confucian
tradition prior to the rise of Qing &ldquo;evidential
scholarship&rdquo;. Yu Yingshih has influentially argued that Qing
scholarship is a continuation of the demand for a &ldquo;return to the
source&rdquo; arising from unresolved metaphysical disputes between
the Cheng-Zhu and Lu-Wang schools in the Song and Ming dynasties. This
demand dates back to the sixteenth century, when Luo Qinshun
&#32645;&#27453;&#38918; (1465&ndash;1547) insisted that philosophy
must be grounded in the Classics (Yu 1996: 21, 91). Wang Yangming
&#29579;&#38525;&#26126; (1472&ndash;1529) also appealed to the old
text of the Great Learning (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Daxue guben</em>
&#22823;&#23416;&#21476;&#26412;) to defend his interpretation of the
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. The paradigm of Qing scholarship
was established by Gu Yanwu &#39015;&#28814;&#27494;
(1613&ndash;1682), who asserted that &ldquo;the proper study of
patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;) is the study of
the classics&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">jingxue ji lixue</em>
&#32147;&#23416;&#21363;&#29702;&#23416;) (Yu 2016: 91, 114&ndash;6).
Gu believed that understanding the Classics required knowledge of
phonology. More broadly speaking, the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
could be known only through evidential
learning, which comprises phonology, geography, astronomy, and so on.
According to Gu, scholars aim to bring order to the world, which
requires understanding the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. This
understanding is impossible without classical research (Qian 2011:
146). By the eighteenth century, scholars were so focused on
evidential learning that they neglected philosophy.</p>

<p>
A widespread concern with the verification problem helps to explain
this shift in focus. The key lies in the object to be verified. For
instance, the <em>Rites of Zhou</em> contains details about the rites
established by the sages, such as the materials, size, and color used
in mourning dress, which can be determined through evidential learning
and empirical evidence. In contrast, although it too must be based on
a correct understanding of the terms in the texts, the correct
interpretation of the philosophy of the sages cannot be entirely
settled by empirical evidence. This was why Qing scholars regarded
evidential learning as solid learning (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shixue</em>
&#23526;&#23416;) and viewed
philosophy as &ldquo;empty&rdquo; or &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xu</em>
&#34395;). These scholars applied a
different interpretation of the Conveyance Thesis from Dai. For Dai,
the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> of the sages lies in the
philosophy underlying the creation of institutions; evidential
learning is thus a necessary but <em>not</em> sufficient means to
discovering the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. In contrast, his
contemporaries viewed the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> as
immanent in the institutions, and thus evidential learning was both a
necessary and sufficient means of discovering the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>.</p>

<p>
This implicit difference in how Dai interprets the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
results in his distinct methodology and
his dissatisfaction with the academic climate of his day. For
Dai&rsquo;s contemporaries, the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> is
the institutions the sages established to govern the world. For Dai,
the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> is the philosophy or guiding
principles the sages applied in creating these institutions. However,
we may question the scope of the understanding of the Classics that
Dai demands. For example, to understand the sages&rsquo; guiding
principles, a deep understanding of classical mathematics and
astronomy may be unnecessary. It is unclear to what extent Dai&rsquo;s
philosophy is informed by his evidential learning. The literature to
date has not yet provided a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>
To return to a point raised at the beginning of this section, since
Dai&rsquo;s goal is to understand the sages&rsquo; philosophy or
principles, it makes sense that in his interpretive project he assigns
the <em>Analects</em> and the <em>Mencius</em>, two relatively
philosophical works, the same importance as the Six Classics. However,
we can still ask why he chose the <em>Mencius</em> rather than the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xunzi</em>
as a foundational text for
interpreting the sages&rsquo; <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. Dai
believed that Mencius&rsquo;s moral psychology was more plausible than
Xunzi&rsquo;s, but this alone does not fully justify the choice. A
possible answer is this: While the Conveyance Thesis can rule out some
interpretations of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>&mdash;such
as those of Daoism and Buddhism&mdash;it does not leave us with a
single interpretation. Among interpretations that align with the Six
Classics, Dai&rsquo;s approach is to select the one he considers
philosophically most plausible, which is that he finds in the
<em>Mencius</em>. Hence he includes the <em>Mencius</em> rather than
the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xunzi</em> as a foundational text. To
exclude the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xunzi</em> solely because it
contradicts the <em>Mencius</em> would be a case of obviously circular
reasoning.</p>

<h2 id="Met">3. Metaphysics</h2>

<h3 id="Dao">3.1 <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> &#36947;</h3>

<p>
In explaining the idea of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> &#36947;
(the right ethical and social way of life), Dai distinguishes between
the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>
&#22825;&#36947; and the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of humanity &#20154;&#36947;. The <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>&mdash;in
effect, the path of the
natural world&mdash;refers to the continuous flow and transformation
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> &#27683; (dynamic &ldquo;vital
stuff&rdquo;), leading to the endless creation and alteration of all
things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">

<p>
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Dao</em> is akin to a process or journey; it
is the continuous flow and transformation of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>,
the unending cycle of life. Thus it is
called the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>. (<em>Sz</em>

<p>
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em> (&ldquo;Heaven&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Nature&rdquo;) is an all-encompassing concept, roughly
analogous to &ldquo;the world&rdquo; or &ldquo;nature&rdquo;, which
includes living and non-living things. The birth of living things,
including humans, is explained by the flow of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>,
understood through the workings of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yin</em>
&#38512; and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yang</em>
&#38525; and the five phases, similar
to how all objects are formed. Different endowments of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
lead to the varying natures (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xing</em>
&#24615;) of different living
beings.</p>

<p>
The <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Dadailiji</em> says, &ldquo;The
allotment from the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> is fate (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ming</em>
&#21629;), and formation into one
thing is nature (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xing</em> &#24615;)&rdquo;.
This refers to how people and creatures are divided out of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yin</em>
and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yang</em>
and the five phases, and each person or creature has its nature formed
on the basis of what has been allotted to it. <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yin</em>
and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yang</em>
and the five phases are the substance of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>;
the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
and the understanding heart-mind are the
substance of nature (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xing</em>). Because
they have substance, they can be divided [in various ways]; and
because they are divided [in various ways], they are not equal. This
is why the ancients said that nature is based on the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>.
(<em>Sz</em> 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, the everyday life of humans is a part of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
From this perspective, since humans are part of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>,
the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of humanity is part of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Dai sees a significant difference between the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of humanity and the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of inanimate objects and of living
things that lack awareness (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">jingshuang</em>
&#31934;&#29245;), such as plants. Humans and other animals that
possess awareness can act against what they should do, or what is
&ldquo;imperative&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>
&#24517;&#28982;) for them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#19968;&#20107;&#20043;&#21892;&#65292;&#21063;&#19968;&#20107;&#21512;&#26044;&#22825;&#65307;&#25104;&#24615;&#38614;&#27530;&#32780;&#20854;&#21892;&#20063;&#21063;&#19968;&#65292;&#21892;&#65292;&#20854;&#24517;&#28982;&#20063;&#65307;&#24615;&#65292;&#20854;&#33258;&#28982;&#20063;&#65307;&#27512;&#26044;&#24517;&#28982;&#65292;&#36969;&#23436;&#20854;&#33258;&#28982;&#65292;&#27492;&#20043;&#35586;&#33258;&#28982;&#20043;&#26997;&#33268;&#65292;&#22825;&#22320;&#20154;&#29289;&#20043;&#36947;&#26044;&#26159;&#20046;&#30433;&#12290;&#22312;&#22825;&#36947;&#19981;&#20998;&#35328;&#65292;&#32780;&#22312;&#20154;&#29289;&#20998;&#35328;&#20043;&#22987;&#26126;&#12290;</p>

<p>
When one thing is good, that thing conforms to <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>;
although the nature (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xing</em>)
of things may vary, their goodness is
one and the same. Goodness is what is imperative (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>);
nature (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xing</em>)
is what is self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>).
To return to what is imperative is
to bring the self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>) to
completion. This is called the ultimate fulfillment of what is self-so
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>). In this way, the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>
and earth, humanity and other animals, is completely fulfilled.
Regarding the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian,</em>
we do not speak of this distinction
[between the self-so and the imperative], but regarding humanity and
other animals only by speaking of this distinction can we be clear.
(<em>Sz</em> 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dai uses the example of terrestrial animals dying in water and aquatic
animals dying on land to illustrate the possibility and consequences
of animals violating what is imperative for them (<em>Sz</em> 32). For
humans, he cites northern people who cannot endure southern heat and
southern people who cannot endure northern cold as examples of such
transgression. Humans and other animals may fail to fulfill their <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
if they do not adhere to what is
imperative. In contrast, inanimate objects cannot violate what is
imperative, so for them there is no distinction between the self-so
and the imperative.</p>

<p>
In different contexts, the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> of
humanity functions as both a descriptive and normative notion. It
refers to the actual daily lives of humans, but also to the patterns
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;) they must follow to avoid
harm. Similarly, in different contexts, the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>
plays both descriptive and normative roles, depicting both what
actually occurs and the ideal path by which everything flourishes (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shengsheng</em>
&#29983;&#29983;, the
&ldquo;thriving of generativity&rdquo; or &ldquo;flourishing of
life&rdquo;). (See Angle, forthcoming, for further discussion
concerning the normativity of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of humanity and the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>.)</p>

<h3 id="Li">3.2 <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Li</em> &#29702;</h3>

<p>
Dai employs the idea of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;
(orderly pattern or patterns) to explain what is imperative for humans
and other animals. As Dai interprets them, some of his Song-dynasty
Confucian predecessors held a dualist view, on which pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>),
an immaterial, abstract organizing
structure or grain, joins together with material <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
&#27683; (&ldquo;dynamic stuff&rdquo;)
to form concrete objects and phenomena. (To what extent Dai is correct
to attribute this view to thinkers such as Zhu Xi is a matter of
scholarly controversy.) Against any such dualist view, Dai argues that
patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) are not entities existing
separately from <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>. Instead, they are
the typical or normal grain, format, or regularities by which things
are organized and behave. Dai says:</p>

<p>
[Mencius] raises the concept of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>
&#29702; to show that the mind is capable of making
distinctions&hellip;. Through differentiation, each aspect has its own
unchanging norms (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ze</em>), which are called
&ldquo;pattern&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>).

<p>
To uphold something as regular is called a &ldquo;norm&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ze</em>);
to treat each according to its
differentiation is called &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>);
to embody it in words and conduct is
called &ldquo;fine virtue&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yide</em>).
(<em>Sz</em> 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;) are norms (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ze</em>
&#21063;) appropriately followed by an
agent when conforming to them fulfills the inherent ends of that
agent&rsquo;s activity. For instance, any living creature is engaged
in the activity of living, for which survival is a fundamental end and
a necessary component of well-being. For terrestrial animals, living
on land is pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>), because for
them living on land contributes to their inherent end of survival.
Accordingly, this pattern is also the basis for the norm (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ze</em>)
that terrestrial creatures must live on
land. Since patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) are the
causal regularities and relations by which such ends can be fulfilled,
they do not have an ontological status separate from the activity of
pursuing the ends. They simply describe the distinctions,
regularities, and so forth that best align with these ends. Living on
land allows terrestrial animals to survive. Living in water would
cause them to die, and so it is pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>)
for them to live on land. Since pattern
in this example is simply a behavior regularity that facilitates
certain creatures&rsquo; well-being, it is not an &ldquo;entity&rdquo;
that exists independently of concrete creatures and their
behavior.</p>

<p>
Dai understands the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> of
humanity&mdash;and thus the good human life&mdash;at least partly in
terms of the fulfillment of people&rsquo;s feelings (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qing</em>
&#24773;) and wants (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yu</em>
&#27442;). Accordingly, he sees the
fulfillment of feelings and wants as constituting pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#20154;&#20523;&#26085;&#29992;&#65292;&#32854;&#20154;&#20197;&#36890;&#22825;&#19979;&#20043;&#24773;&#65292;&#36930;&#22825;&#19979;&#20043;&#27442;&#65292;&#27402;&#20043;&#32780;&#20998;&#29702;&#19981;&#29245;&#65292;&#26159;&#35586;&#29702;&#12290;</p>

<p>
As to human relations and daily activity, the sages apply their
comprehension of all the world&rsquo;s feelings to fulfill all the
world&rsquo;s wants; weighing these such that there are no errors in
the differentiating patterns&mdash;this is called
&ldquo;pattern&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>).
(<em>Sz</em> 40)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This relation to pattern explains the normative function of Confucian
norms of conduct, or &ldquo;ritual propriety&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>
&#31150;). Dai claims that the
sages&rsquo; rituals (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#31150;)
exemplify pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;) because
they successfully promote human well-being by managing people&rsquo;s
feelings (<em>Sz</em> 37).</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#31150;&#20043;&#35373;&#25152;&#20197;&#27835;&#22825;&#19979;&#20043;&#24773;&#65292;&#25110;&#35009;&#20854;&#36942;&#65292;&#25110;&#21193;&#20854;&#19981;&#21450;&#65292;&#20478;&#30693;&#22825;&#22320;&#20043;&#20013;&#32780;&#24050;&#30691;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Rituals are established to regulate the feelings of the world, either
by curbing excesses or by exhorting them where they fall short, simply
so that people understand the fitting mean in the world. (<em>Sz</em>
37)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another normative notion, virtue (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">de</em>
&#24503;), is also integrated into this cluster of interrelated
concepts. A virtuous person is one who follows <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
and thus conforms to pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>)
such that not only their own but
others&rsquo; wants and feelings are fulfilled.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#36947;&#24503;&#20043;&#30427;&#65292;&#20351;&#20154;&#20043;&#27442;&#28961;&#19981;&#36930;&#65292;&#20154;&#20043;&#24773;&#28961;&#19981;&#36948;&#65292;&#26031;&#24050;&#30691;&#12290;</p>

<p>
The flourishing of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> and virtue is
simply for none of people&rsquo;s wants to go unsatisfied and none of
their feelings to go unfulfilled. (<em>Sz</em> 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The highest form of virtue thus lies in living according to norms that
facilitate fulfillment for all persons. The sages in particular
demonstrated the utmost virtue by not only living a morally exemplary
life but establishing and promulgating norms of propriety that helped
lead others to live virtuous lives.</p>

<h2 id="MorPsyPeoNat">4. Moral Psychology: People&rsquo;s Nature</h2>

<p>
Dai&rsquo;s novel, complex views about human moral psychology
underwrite his account of pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>),
his rejection of the dualism of pattern and <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
(dynamic stuff), his explanation of
normativity, his view of moral development, and his account of moral
deliberation. This section sketches his systematic moral
psychology.</p>

<p>
Dai understands people to have a physical body, within which there are
the &ldquo;blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xueqi</em>
&#34880;&#27683;) and the
&ldquo;understanding heart-mind&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xinzhi</em>
&#24515;&#30693;). The blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
and the heart-mind are both part of the
&ldquo;actualized object&rdquo; or the &ldquo;materialization&rdquo;
of our nature (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xing</em> &#24615;)
(<em>Sz</em> 16). The blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> are
fluid- or vapor-like substances that circulate throughout the body.
The understanding (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">zhi</em> &#30693;) is the
heart-mind&rsquo;s capacity for awareness and cognition. Although the
blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> function similarly in all
healthy persons, the clarity and accuracy of people&rsquo;s awareness
and understanding vary. Depending on experience, education, attention,
and habit, some perceive only a limited range of patterns, while
others&mdash;such as the sages&mdash;achieve the highest level of
understanding, consistently discerning the underlying patterns
(<em>Sz</em> 6).</p>

<p>
The blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> produce <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yu</em>
&#27442;, or &ldquo;bodily wants&rdquo;
(<em>Sz</em> 8, 30). <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Yu</em> is often
interpreted as &ldquo;desire&rdquo;, but for Dai it has a narrower
scope. You can have a desire to be a doctor or a desire that your
favorite team win the football game, but to Dai these attitudes are
not &ldquo;<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yu.</em>&rdquo; In his
psychology, <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yu</em> refers only to craving
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ai</em> &#24859;) or avoiding (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">wei</em>
&#30031;) sounds, colours, smells, and
tastes and to cherishing life and fearing death (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">huaisheng
weisi</em>
&#25079;&#29983;&#30031;&#27515;, <em>Sz</em> 21, 30). Dai&rsquo;s use
of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yu</em> is thus closer to &ldquo;basic
wants&rdquo; than to &ldquo;desires&rdquo;. Since such wants issue
from the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>, not the
heart-mind&rsquo;s understanding, they are roughly the same for all
persons. (For further discussion, see Tiwald 2010a.)</p>

<p>
The blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> also produce <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qing</em>
&#24773;, or &ldquo;feelings&rdquo;.
These are noncognitive responses of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xi lu ai le</em>
&#21916;&#24594;&#21696;&#27138;), leading to misery or comfort (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">can
shu</em> &#24920;&#33298;) (<em>Sz</em> 30).
Craving ice cream because you are hungry is a &ldquo;want&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">yu</em>);
feeling delighted when you get the ice
cream is a feeling (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qing</em>)&mdash;a
comfortable or pleasant one, and so it is a &ldquo;like&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">hao</em>
&#22909;), rather than a
&ldquo;dislike&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">wu</em> &#24801;).
Like the basic wants, feelings do not require understanding and so are
largely the same for everyone. By contrast, the emotions of alarm and
sympathy Mencius says we have on seeing a child in danger are not
&ldquo;feelings&rdquo;, according to Dai.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#23391;&#23376;&#33289;&#24827;&#38577;&#12289;&#32670;&#24801;&#12289;&#36781;&#35731;&#12289;&#26159;&#38750;&#20043;&#24515;&#35586;&#20043;&#24515;&#65292;&#19981;&#35586;&#20043;&#24773;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Mencius mentioned the hearts [mental attitudes] of compassion,
shame-and-loathing, respect, and approval-or-disapproval and called
them &ldquo;heart-mind&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xin</em>),
not &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qing</em>).
(<em>Sz</em> 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These &ldquo;mental attitudes&rdquo; require understanding and so
depend on the functioning of the heart-mind (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xin</em>
&#24515;). We might interpret them as
inclinations, concerns, or states of mind.</p>

<p>
The understanding of the heart-mind (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xinzhi</em>
&#24515;&#30693;) provides the
capacity for perception and cognition, for aesthetic and normative
judgment (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">mei chou shi fei</em>
&#32654;&#37276;&#26159;&#38750;) and accordingly for admiring
&ldquo;pattern and right&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">liyi</em>
&#29702;&#32681;) (<em>Sz</em> 7, 8). Moral attitudes such as
sympathy, shame-and-loathing, respect, and approval-or-disapproval
have a cognitive component, which arises from the understanding
(<em>Sz</em> 21). This cognitive component involves seeing an analogy
between one&rsquo;s own wants and feelings and those of others, which
triggers the moral attitude. The result, according to Dai, is that if
we had no wants and feelings ourselves, we would be unable to have
moral reactions such as sympathy to the situation of other people.</p>

<p>
So, to feel the sympathetic concern associated with benevolence (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ren</em>
&#20161;), we need to have wants
(primarily, cherishing life and fearing death), which prompt us to
have feelings such as delight in life and sorrow over death. To these
states produced by our blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>, we
apply our cognitive capacities&mdash;the understanding&mdash;to grasp
the importance of life to us and, by analogy, to everyone.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#23391;&#23376;&#35328;&#12300;&#20170;&#20154;&#20045;&#35211;&#23418;&#23376;&#23559;&#20837;&#20117;&#65292;&#30342;&#26377;&#24629;&#24789;&#24827;&#38577;&#20043;&#24515;&#12301;&#65292;&#28982;&#21063;&#25152;&#35586;&#24827;&#38577;&#12289;&#25152;&#35586;&#20161;&#32773;&#65292;&#38750;&#24515;&#30693;&#20043;&#22806;&#21029;&#12300;&#22914;&#26377;&#29289;&#28937;&#34255;&#26044;&#24515;&#12301;&#20063;&#65292;&#24049;&#30693;&#25079;&#29983;&#32780;&#30031;&#27515;&#65292;&#25925;&#24629;&#24789;&#26044;&#23418;&#23376;&#20043;&#21361;&#65292;&#24827;&#38577;&#26044;&#23418;&#23376;&#20043;&#27515;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Mencius said, &ldquo;If people were to suddenly see a child about to
fall into a well, they would all have a heart-mind of alarm and
compassion&rdquo;. That being so, what&rsquo;s called
&ldquo;compassion&rdquo; or &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; is not some
distinct thing concealed in the heart-mind, apart from the
understanding. We ourselves understand [what it is] to cherish life
and fear death, and so we are alarmed at the danger to the child and
compassionate about the child&rsquo;s [risk of] death. (<em>Sz</em>
21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence, Dai holds, ethical norms and values are grounded partly in the
wants of the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>, which the
heart-mind&rsquo;s understanding recognizes and applies to evaluate
and guide action. Norms and values do not come from some
&ldquo;outside&rdquo;, transcendent source such as <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tian</em>
or abstract, cosmic pattern.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#21476;&#36066;&#32854;&#25152;&#35586;&#20161;&#32681;&#31150;&#26234;&#65292;&#19981;&#27714;&#26044;&#25152;&#35586;&#27442;&#20043;&#22806;&#65292;&#19981;&#38626;&#20046;&#34880;&#27683;&#24515;&#30693;&#12290;</p>

<p>
What the ancient worthies and sages called &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo;,
&ldquo;right&rdquo;, &ldquo;propriety&rdquo;, and &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;
they did not seek outside of what they called &ldquo;wants&rdquo; and
was not separate from the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
and the heart-mind&rsquo;s understanding. (<em>Sz</em> 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Dai&rsquo;s view, what he takes to be the prevailing Song- and
Ming-dynasty Neo-Confucian view of moral cultivation as purifying
oneself of everyday wants or desires and mundane, worldly human
feelings is not only mistaken but incoherent. (Again, it is
controversial whether his interpretation of his predecessors&rsquo;
views is fair.) Without wants and feelings, we would lose our capacity
for moral agency, because we would be unable to refer to our own wants
and feelings as a benchmark by which to understand the well-being of
other people.</p>

<p>
Beyond merely being able to recognize others&rsquo; well-being, Dai
thinks, the heart-mind&rsquo;s understanding is constituted such that
conforming to ethical norms is inherently pleasing to us. He makes
this point by developing the claim in <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Mengzi</em>
6A:7 that people share a tendency to
be pleased by &ldquo;pattern and right&rdquo; just as we (purportedly)
share a tendency to find the same foods delicious. Dai claims that
this tendency is &ldquo;self-so&rdquo; for the
understanding&mdash;that is, it arises from the inherent functioning
of the heart-mind, without external influence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#27442;&#32773;&#65292;&#34880;&#27683;&#20043;&#33258;&#28982;&#65307;&#20854;&#22909;&#26159;&#25087;&#24503;&#20063;&#65292;&#24515;&#30693;&#20043;&#33258;&#28982;&#12290;&hellip;&#24515;&#30693;&#20043;&#33258;&#28982;&#65292;&#26410;&#26377;&#19981;&#24709;&#29702;&#32681;&#32773;&#12290;&#26410;&#33021;&#30433;&#24471;&#29702;&#21512;&#32681;&#32819;&#12290;</p>

<p>
[To have] wants [is something that comes] self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>)
for the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>;
to be fond of fine virtue [is something
that comes] self-so for the understanding heart-mind&hellip;. What is
self-so for the understanding heart-mind is such that there&rsquo;s
never been anyone who fails to be pleased by pattern and right;
it&rsquo;s just that [some people] cannot fully grasp pattern and
comply with right. (<em>Sz</em> 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So Dai claims that insofar as we apply the heart-mind&rsquo;s
understanding correctly, we have an inherent disposition to follow
pattern and do what is right because doing so is pleasing or
satisfying.</p>

<p>
Dai stresses that moral feelings such as the pleasure of conforming to
appropriate norms have a physiological basis. The heart-mind is not a
mysterious, abstract capacity but a physical organ composed of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
&#27683; that is integral to moral
deliberation and conduct. Dai asserts that the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
(here roughly the energy or spirit) of
the heart-mind (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xinqi</em> &#24515;&#27683;)
becomes strong and self-possessed (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">changran
zide</em> &#26274;&#28982;&#33258;&#24471;) when we follow patterns
and norms that we believe to be correct. In contrast, acting against
these norms causes the heart-mind&rsquo;s <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
to become depressed and frustrated
(<em>Sz</em> 8). This gloomy state is an uncomfortable
psycho-physiological condition that prompts us to avoid certain
actions, whether immediately or in the future.</p>

<p>
Despite how features of our motivational structure align with moral
norms, Dai thinks, people do not always act morally. He identifies two
main causes of moral failure: selfishness and blinkering.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#20154;&#20043;&#24739;&#65292;&#26377;&#31169;&#26377;&#34109;&#65307;&#31169;&#20986;&#26044;&#24773;&#27442;&#65292;&#34109;&#20986;&#26044;&#24515;&#30693;&#12290;</p>

<p>
The problems with people lie in selfishness (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">si</em>
&#31169;) and blinkering (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">bi</em>
&#34109;); selfishness arises from
feelings and wants, while blinkering arises from the
heart-mind&rsquo;s understanding. (<em>Sz</em> 40)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Selfishness refers to people&rsquo;s drive to fulfill their feelings
and wants, which can override their motivation to follow moral norms.
Blinkering refers to an inability to grasp the correct patterns. The
motivational structure Dai describes ensures that people are motivated
to act according to what they judge to be the correct patterns, but
their judgment can be mistaken. To avoid blinkering, Dai emphasizes
the importance of learning, particularly from the teachings of the
sages. To avoid selfishness, he believes that cultivating reverence
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">jing</em> &#25964;) is essential, as it
allows us to combat misguided wants and feelings (<em>Sz</em> 12).
Applying a metaphor familiar from classical Confucianism, Dai views
the heart-mind as analogous to a ruler that commands the other parts
of the person. It is capable of judging what aligns with pattern and
right (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">liyi</em> &#29702;&#32681;),
overcoming the influence of wants and feelings, and so rectifying our
actions (<em>Sz</em> 8). However, the primary focus of his discussion
is on understanding, and thus blinkering, and he provides few details
on how to cultivate reverence or to rectify our actions.</p>

<h2 id="Nor">5. Normativity</h2>

<p>
One of Dai&rsquo;s signature doctrines is the convergence of the
self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em> &#33258;&#28982;) and
the imperative (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>
&#24517;&#28982;). This convergence has both metaethical and practical
dimensions. On the metaethical side, from facts about what is self-so,
or comes naturally for things, we can discover what is imperative, or
norms of conduct, which constitute normative patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>
&#29702;) or <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>.
On the practical side, Dai holds that
conduct that conforms to the imperative fulfills what is self-so for
the heart-mind. This fulfillment is manifested through a sense of
peace and the absence of regret, presumably corresponding to how the
heart-mind is pleased by pattern and right. Dai highlights the
connection between the self-so and the imperative in a key
passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#30001;&#34880;&#27683;&#20043;&#33258;&#28982;&#65292;&#32780;&#23529;&#23519;&#20043;&#20197;&#30693;&#20854;&#24517;&#28982;&#65292;&#26159;&#20043;&#35586;&#29702;&#32681;&#65307;&#33258;&#28982;&#20043;&#33287;&#24517;&#28982;&#65292;&#38750;&#20108;&#20107;&#20063;&#12290;&#23601;&#20854;&#33258;&#28982;&#65292;&#26126;&#20043;&#30433;&#32780;&#28961;&#24190;&#24494;&#20043;&#22833;&#28937;&#65292;&#26159;&#20854;&#24517;&#28982;&#20063;&#12290;&#22914;&#26159;&#32780;&#24460;&#28961;&#25022;&#65292;&#22914;&#26159;&#32780;&#24460;&#23433;&#65292;&#26159;&#20035;&#33258;&#28982;&#20043;&#26997;&#21063;&#12290;&#33509;&#20219;&#20854;&#33258;&#28982;&#32780;&#27969;&#26044;&#22833;&#65292;&#36681;&#21930;&#20854;&#33258;&#28982;&#65292;&#32780;&#38750;&#33258;&#28982;&#20063;&#65307;&#25925;&#27512;&#26044;&#24517;&#28982;&#65292;&#36969;&#23436;&#20854;&#33258;&#28982;&#12290;</p>

<p>
If we examine what comes self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>)
for the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>
in order to discover what is imperative
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>) for it, [the result] is what we
call &ldquo;pattern and right&rdquo;. The self-so and the imperative
are not two separate matters. With respect to the self-so, to fully
understand it such that there isn&rsquo;t the slightest
error&mdash;this reveals what is imperative (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>).
If, attaining this, we are at
peace, without regrets, then this is the ultimate norm for what is
self-so [for moral agents]. If we indulge the self-so [our unregulated
wants and feelings] and so drift into error, then the result is not
that we attain the self-so but that we lose it. Thus by turning toward
what is imperative (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>) for things,
we bring what is self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>) to
completion. (<em>Sz</em> 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dai suggests that by thoroughly understanding the inherent
propensities of things&mdash;what is self-so for them&mdash;we can
identify the conditions in which they best fulfill, or
&ldquo;complete&rdquo;, these propensities, attaining a state of
well-being. These conditions can be taken to determine norms, which he
calls the &ldquo;imperative&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>).
The role of peace and regret here
relates to our earlier discussion
 (<a href="#MorPsyPeoNat">section 4</a>)
 about the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> of the heart-mind being
strong and self-possessed when we follow what we take to be moral
norms and frustrated when we fail to do so. What is self-so for the
heart-mind, which draws us toward moral norms, is manifested partly in
the natural movement of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> within
one&rsquo;s body. Therefore, by following what is self-so for the
heart-mind, according to Dai, we can also fulfill what is imperative
for humanity. Dai asserts that this convergence between the self-so
and the imperative is the ultimate fulfillment for human agents.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">

<p>
By turning toward what is imperative (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>),
one brings what is self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>)
to completion. This is called the
ultimate fulfillment of what is self-so (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ziran</em>).
In this way, the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of Heaven and Earth, of humanity and
animals, is completely fulfilled. (<em>Sz</em> 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Why should one follow the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> of the
heart-mind, which leads to moral actions when one has correct moral
knowledge, rather than the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>,
which leads to selfish actions? Both
sources of motivation are equally self-so for the human person, yet
Dai&rsquo;s conception of the &ldquo;ultimate fulfillment&rdquo; of
the self-so seems to assign priority to the heart-mind&rsquo;s <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>.
For Dai, the answer is that this
prioritization is actually what is self-so for humanity. Of course,
Dai holds that acting morally also entails fulfilling our
blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em>&mdash;our physical
needs&mdash;and thus satisfying our basic wants and feelings (for
further discussion, see
 <a href="#NorEth">section 7</a>).
 But satisfying our basic wants and feelings does not mean simply
indulging our physical wants. For in Dai&rsquo;s framework, only by
prioritizing the self-so of the heart-mind can we attain
&ldquo;completion&rdquo; in the sense that <em>both</em> the
blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> and the heart-mind are
fulfilled. In contrast, indulging what is self-so for the
blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi</em> alone would leave the
heart-mind unfulfilled. Arguably, this joint fulfillment of both parts
of the person follows from Dai&rsquo;s wider stance that the
flourishing of all living things (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shengsheng</em>
&#29983;&#29983;) is a
foundational value. The reasoning would be that the flourishing of
living things naturally includes human flourishing, and human
flourishing requires the fulfillment of both parts of the person. For
both parts of the person to attain fulfillment, we must prioritize
fulfillment of the heart-mind&mdash;and thus conformity to moral
norms&mdash;over unrestrained indulgence of the blood-and-<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi.</em>
(For more discussion, see Chong
forthcoming.)</p>

<p>
The ties between the concepts of the self-so and the imperative, along
with the dual descriptive and normative roles Dai assigns to the
concepts of pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;) and
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> (&#36947;), can be taken to raise a
version of the is-ought question. On the one hand, Dai treats patterns
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) as descriptive regularities that
have no separate ontological status from <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi,</em>
the dynamic, material stuff of which
the world is constituted. Given the Confucian theoretical framework,
there is no particular conceptual difficulty in claiming that
regularities of behavior are part of the ontological realm of <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qi.</em>
However, Dai also takes self-so
patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) to underwrite his
conception of the imperative (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">biran</em>).
How does he explain the link between descriptive pattern&mdash;or
&ldquo;is&rdquo;&mdash;and imperative norms&mdash;or
&ldquo;ought&rdquo;? Why should we follow the patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>)?
Dai&rsquo;s answer is that adhering to
the patterns tends to fulfill people&rsquo;s feelings and wants and
the heart-mind&rsquo;s inclination toward morality. However, even if
we can confirm empirically that some pattern of behavior indeed has
this outcome, we can still ask why we should seek to fulfill
people&rsquo;s feelings and wants or their heart-mind&rsquo;s
inclination. One possible answer, again, is that doing so is part of
the flourishing of all life, which, like many Confucians, Dai posits
as a foundational value (see Tiwald forthcoming-b). A second,
overlapping answer may be that we already have a commitment to
following the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>, and conforming to
the patterns amounts to the best justified way of practicing the human
<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em> that fulfills what is self-so for
us (see Fraser forthcoming).</p>

<h2 id="MorEpi">6. Moral Epistemology</h2>

<h3 id="SymCon">6.1 Sympathetic Consideration</h3>

<p>
How do we identify pattern and thus the norms we should follow? How do
we determine what course of conduct to take? Dai&rsquo;s proposal is
that the norms to follow are discovered through a process of measuring
others&rsquo; feelings by reference to our own. The fundamental
procedure by which to assess our activity is by identifying
pattern&mdash;and thus norms&mdash;through the use of the sympathetic
consideration (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shu</em> &#24661;) associated
with the &ldquo;negative golden rule&rdquo; of the Confucian
<em>Analects</em>. Dai contends that we should guide action by
patterns we identify through a process of reflection and
deliberation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#20961;&#26377;&#25152;&#26045;&#26044;&#20154;&#65292;&#21453;&#36524;&#32780;&#38748;&#24605;&#20043;&#65306;&#12300;&#20154;&#20197;&#27492;&#26045;&#26044;&#25105;&#65292;&#33021;&#21463;&#20043;&#20046;?&#12301;&#20961;&#26377;&#25152;&#36012;&#26044;&#20154;&#65292;&#21453;&#36524;&#32780;&#38748;&#24605;&#20043;&#65306;&#12300;&#20154;&#20197;&#27492;&#36012;&#26044;&#25105;&#65292;&#33021;&#30433;&#20043;&#20046;?&#12301;&#20197;&#25105;&#32092;&#20043;&#20154;&#65292;&#21063;&#29702;&#26126;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Any time you undertake something that affects others, reflect and
calmly consider: &ldquo;If others did this to me, could I accept
it?&rdquo; Any time you hold others responsible for something, reflect
and calmly consider, &ldquo;If others held me responsible for this,
could I fulfill the responsibility?&rdquo; If we use ourselves [as a
benchmark] to measure [whether things are suitable] for others,
pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) becomes clear.
(<em>Sz</em> 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In conducting this reflection, the indicator of whether we could or
could not accept the treatment we are considering is our
&ldquo;feelings&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qing</em> &#24773;),
specifically, according to Dai&rsquo;s moral psychology, the misery or
comfort we feel in response to the joy, anger, sorrow, or delight
incited by our interactions with things. Again, this role of feelings
is why Dai thinks many Song- and Ming-dynasty Confucians were terribly
mistaken to hold that ethical cultivation requires minimizing or
eliminating wants (or desires) and feelings. Only because we have
wants do we have feelings, and feelings are the basic data we work
from to discover pattern. Without these wants, the mechanism for
sympathetic concern cannot function (see Tiwald 2010a).</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">

<p>
Reflection is a matter of considering what feelings we would have if
others were to indulge their wants and we were on the receiving end.
(<em>Sz</em> 2)</p>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#20197;&#24773;&#32092;&#24773;&#32780;&#28961;&#29245;&#22833;&#65292;&#26044;&#34892;&#20107;&#35488;&#24471;&#20854;&#29702;&#30691;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Using our feelings to measure others&rsquo; feelings without error, in
conducting affairs we can indeed attain their patterns. (<em>Sz</em>
3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Patterns are indicated by whether a proposed path of conduct can
promote mutual satisfaction of wants and feelings. Dai&rsquo;s idea of
measuring others&rsquo; feelings with our own is not a matter of using
ourself as a model for our treatment of others. Rather, he is
attempting to use shared feelings and wants as a way of identifying
what objectively tends to fulfill everyone&rsquo;s wants and feelings.
As we saw in
 <a href="#MorPsyPeoNat">section 4</a>,
 in Dai&rsquo;s moral psychology, wants and feelings are largely the
same for all. For this reason, Dai holds, our own feelings can
accurately indicate others&rsquo;. Hence by hypothetically reflecting
on the feelings a particular situation would induce in us, we can
&ldquo;measure&rdquo; the feelings that others would have in the same
or a similar situation. In principle, if we conduct this measurement
process correctly, Dai thinks, the results will not be biased toward
ourselves or others.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#22825;&#29702;&#20113;&#32773;&#65292;&#35328;&#20046;&#33258;&#28982;&#20043;&#20998;&#29702;&#20063;&#65307;&#33258;&#28982;&#20043;&#20998;&#29702;&#65292;&#20197;&#25105;&#20043;&#24773;&#32092;&#20154;&#20043;&#24773;&#65292;&#32780;&#28961;&#19981;&#24471;&#20854;&#24179;&#26159;&#20063;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Heavenly pattern refers to the distinguishing patterns of what is
self-so. As to the distinguishing patterns of what is self-so, if we
take our feelings to measure others&rsquo; feelings, such that nothing
is out of balance, they are just this. (<em>Sz</em> 2)</p>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#19981;&#20559;&#65292;&#21063;&#20854;&#24773;&#24517;&#21644;&#26131;&#32780;&#24179;&#24661;&#20063;&#12290;</p>

<p>
If one is not biased, then their feelings will surely be harmonious
and gentle, balanced and sympathetic. (<em>Sz</em> 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When our feelings accurately indicate others&rsquo;, they reflect
pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#29702;), or the correct
norms. If we are &ldquo;balanced and sympathetic&rdquo;, we measure
others&rsquo; feelings accurately, and so we can identify pattern,
which is instantiated by conduct that satisfies the feelings of all
sides. If we are not &ldquo;balanced and sympathetic&rdquo;, we may
mistakenly prefer norms that are beneficial to ourselves at
others&rsquo; expense, and these norms fail to conform to the proper
patterns.</p>

<h3 id="ComAff">6.2 Common Affirmability</h3>

<p>
Dai&rsquo;s aim is to offer a procedure for discovering &ldquo;norms
that cannot be exchanged&rdquo; for anything more suitable, which are
the objective content of pattern. One condition for such norms is that
all persons would affirm them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#24515;&#20043;&#25152;&#21516;&#28982;&#22987;&#35586;&#20043;&#29702;&#65292;&#35586;&#20043;&#32681;&hellip;&#20961;&#19968;&#20154;&#20197;&#28858;&#28982;&#65292;&#22825;&#19979;&#33836;&#19990;&#30342;&#26352;&#12300;&#26159;&#19981;&#21487;&#26131;&#20063;&#12301;&#65292;&#27492;&#20043;&#35586;&#21516;&#28982;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Only what all minds similarly affirm to be so can be called
&ldquo;pattern&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo;.&hellip;When each person
affirms something and a myriad generations in the world all say,
&ldquo;this cannot be exchanged [for anything else]&rdquo;, this is
called &ldquo;similarly affirming to be so&rdquo;. (<em>Sz</em> 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Presumably, the &ldquo;all&rdquo; in question is hypothetical, as Dai
is not suggesting the impossible task of actually surveying &ldquo;a
myriad generations&rdquo; of people. On a &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;
reading (see Tiwald forthcoming-a), common affirmability is a
regulative ideal complementary to sympathetic consideration, as
discussed in
 <a href="#SymCon">section 6.1</a>.
 On this interpretation, Dai is implying that we should inquire as to
whether judgments derived from sympathetic consideration are indeed
what people, especially the powerless, would affirm. Through this
procedure, potentially overconfident decision makers may avoid
mistaken judgments about people&rsquo;s shared feelings and wants.</p>

<p>
An alternative reading is that common affirmability implies empirical
verifiability. This line of interpretation builds on Dai&rsquo;s
remarks drawing analogies between proper pattern and craft tools. Just
as the compass and set square are invariably reliable standards for
identifying what is circular or square, a correct grasp of pattern
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) yields reliable norms of
conduct.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#33503;&#24471;&#20854;&#29702;&#30691;&#65292;&#22914;&#30452;&#32773;&#20043;&#20013;&#25080;&#65292;&#24179;&#32773;&#20043;&#20013;&#27700;&#65292;&#22291;&#32773;&#20043;&#20013;&#35215;&#65292;&#26041;&#32773;&#20043;&#20013;&#30697;&#65292;&#28982;&#24460;&#25512;&#35576;&#22825;&#19979;&#33836;&#19990;&#32780;&#28310;&#12290;</p>

<p>
If one attains the correct pattern, just as the vertical matches the
plumb line, the level matches the water-level, the circular matches
the compass, and the square matches the set square, the pattern is a
standard that can be applied to a myriad generations in the world.
(<em>Sz</em> 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By extension, then, if candidate norms indeed conform to the correct
patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>), this conformity can be
affirmed by anyone, just as anyone can use a compass to affirm whether
a figure is a circle. For norms, the test would be whether they indeed
facilitate the fulfillment of people&rsquo;s feelings and wants (Chong
forthcoming). As this relation is a matter of empirical fact,
everyone&mdash;that is, &ldquo;all minds&rdquo;&mdash;can examine the
result and affirm whether the norms indeed conform to the proper
patterns. In contrast, if the verification mechanism were subjective,
such as simply checking against one&rsquo;s own level of confidence in
the results of sympathetic consideration, it is unlikely that common
affirmability could be achieved.</p>

<h2 id="NorEth">7. Normative Ethics</h2>

<p>
A notable aspect of Dai&rsquo;s normative ethics is his recognition of
human wants and feelings as legitimate considerations in moral
reasoning. The main difference between Dai and Song-Ming Confucians
lies in the conceptual priority of these wants and feelings. The
influential Song-dynasty thinker Zhu Xi might agree with Dai, for
example, that fulfilling certain human wants or desires, such as
hunger and thirst, is morally permissible, but the two assign such
wants or desires different places in the structure of their normative
ethics (Tiwald forthcoming-b). For Zhu, desires, including wants, are
justified only if fulfilling them complies with moral norms
established on other grounds. For Dai, in contrast, wants and feelings
are the grounds for the content of moral norms: fulfilling basic wants
and feelings is constitutive of proper pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>).</p>

<p>
Although Dai&rsquo;s normative ethics takes the satisfaction of
people&rsquo;s wants and feelings as a basic value, unlike act
utilitarianism, Dai does not evaluate discrete actions on the basis of
whether they fulfill or promote this end. Instead, more like an
indirect utilitarian, he understands various Confucian moral ideals
such as virtue (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">de</em> &#24503;) and ritual
propriety (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em> &#31150;) as
fundamentally explained in terms of how they fulfill people&rsquo;s
wants and feelings. For example, he sees benevolence (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ren</em>
&#20161;) as a virtue by which one
contributes to the flourishing of all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="zh-Hant">
&#20161;&#32773;&#65292;&#29983;&#29983;&#20043;&#24503;&#20063;&#65307;&#12300;&#27665;&#20043;&#36074;&#30691;&#65292;&#26085;&#29992;&#39154;&#39135;&#12301;&#65292;&#28961;&#38750;&#20154;&#36947;&#25152;&#20197;&#29983;&#29983;&#32773;&#12290;&#19968;&#20154;&#36930;&#20854;&#29983;&#65292;&#25512;&#20043;&#32780;&#33287;&#22825;&#19979;&#20849;&#36930;&#20854;&#29983;&#65292;&#20161;&#20063;&#12290;</p>

<p>
Benevolence (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">ren</em>) is the virtue of
sustaining flourishing lives (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shengsheng</em>).
&ldquo;People&rsquo;s material
character lies in their daily activities, eating, and drinking&rdquo;
means nothing other than that the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">dao</em>
of humanity is how life flourishes. When one person fulfills their own
life and then extends this so as to join with all the world in
fulfilling their lives together, that is benevolence. (<em>Sz</em>
36)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given the connections Dai draws between moral norms and virtues and
well-being, understood as the satisfaction of wants and feelings, some
scholars have suggested that his normative ethics bears a strong
similarity to indirect utilitarianism (see Hu 1963; Zheng 2015; Carleo
forthcoming). Others have argued that Dai does not see moral virtue as
determined purely by how much it maximizes well-being and so his
stance is not appropriately characterized as utilitarian (Tiwald
forthcoming-b). Insofar as Dai may be applying the concept of self-so
patterns (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>) as a foundational
evaluative concept, his ethics may be structurally unlike any form of
consequentialism (Fraser forthcoming). How best to characterize
Dai&rsquo;s normative ethical stance remains a disputed question.</p>

<p>
A further, interrelated set of questions concern Dai&rsquo;s
foundational values. First, while the collective flourishing of all
life (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shengsheng</em> &#29983;&#29983;) is
undoubtedly a value for him, it is unclear whether it is a unique
foundational value or whether he also affirms other basic values. For
instance, Tiwald (forthcoming-b) suggests that &ldquo;good
order&rdquo; (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">tiaoli</em> &#26781;&#29702;)
might be a further basic value or perhaps even a more fundamental
value than collective flourishing (which Tiwald calls &ldquo;life
fulfillment&rdquo;). Furthermore, given that collective flourishing
(<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shengsheng</em>) is clearly a value for
Dai, the question arises of what the exact relation is between such
flourishing and the satisfaction of wants and feelings, the pivotal
good he takes to be indicative of pattern (<em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">li</em>).
In Dai&rsquo;s framework, satisfying
basic wants and feelings is surely a prerequisite for collective human
flourishing. But is it a sufficient condition, or are other conditions
also relevant? One response might be that satisfying the wants and
feelings of all is sufficient for collective human flourishing. After
all, satisfying all people&rsquo;s wants and feelings is no easy task.
Our joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are subject to many social
constraints that are beyond our individual control. Fulfilling
one&rsquo;s own feelings probably also entails maintaining
&ldquo;harmonious&rdquo; and &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; interpersonal
relationships. It seems plausible to describe members of a community
that attains mutual fulfillment of wants and feelings as living
flourishing lives, at least by some minimal standard.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it also seems reasonable to argue that this
conception of human flourishing is too thin, and a flourishing life
should include other goods as well, such as ethical virtues, the
fulfillment of personal projects, or artistic achievement. A plausible
interpretation of some of Dai&rsquo;s remarks about the
&ldquo;completion&rdquo; or &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo; of what is
self-so, as discussed in
 <a href="#MorPsyPeoNat">sections 4 and 5</a>
 above, is that a further condition for a flourishing human life is
the satisfaction of the <em lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">xinqi</em>
&#24515;&#27683; (the heart-mind&rsquo;s vital stuff), which has an
inclination toward moral norms. An implication is that individuals
within a community can flourish only when they are morally virtuous.
Intriguingly, since for Dai part of moral virtue is acting in a way
that contributes to the fulfillment of all persons&rsquo; wants and
feelings, a community whose members reliably manifested moral virtue
would probably also be one in which people&rsquo;s wants and feelings
were fulfilled. Possibly, then, Dai might say that in practice the two
conceptions of flourishing just sketched converge and mutually
reinforce each other, a view suggested as well by our discussion in
 <a href="#Nor">section 5</a>.
 How best to explain Dai&rsquo;s conception of human flourishing is
another issue about which the scholarly literature has yet to reach a
consensus.</p>
