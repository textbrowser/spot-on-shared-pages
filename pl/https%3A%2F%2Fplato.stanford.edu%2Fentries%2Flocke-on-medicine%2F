<h1>Locke on Medicine</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Oct 14, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
While Locke is remembered for his numerous contributions to a wide
range of fields&mdash;philosophy, political theory, economics,
religious exegesis, education and psychology&mdash;and while he took
on numerous roles in his career&mdash;academic, diplomat, secretary,
tutor, advisor and civil servant&mdash;it is easy to forget that he
was a trained and qualified professional. Locke spent a good part of
his career&mdash;at least a decade&mdash;studying, training, writing,
apprenticing and eventually practicing as a physician. He worked
closely with a number of leading researchers on a range of
contemporary medical, physiological and related subjects, taking
hundred of notes, and authoring several extended reflections on
medical matters. These writings cover a range of topics and
perspectives, and illustrate Locke&rsquo;s changing attitudes as his
views evolved. None of Locke&rsquo;s medical writings were published
in his lifetime, but he played a significant role in the writing and
publication of Thomas Sydenham&rsquo;s <em>Observationes Medicae</em>
(London 1676), a ground-breaking work of medical empiricism, having
worked very closely with Sydenham for several years. Locke began to
write his <em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em> in 1671, when
his collaboration with Sydenham was at its closest, and there are
clear parallels between the two mens&rsquo; thinking.</p>

<p>
While there is as yet no definitive account of Locke&rsquo;s medical
work, the topic has been of increasing interest to scholars over the
last several decades. Kenneth Dewhurst produced numerous articles on
Locke&rsquo;s medical work drawing upon the recently acquired Lovelace
collection of Locke manuscripts in the 1950s and 60s, culminating in
his monograph <em>John Locke: Physician and Philosopher</em> (1963),
contextualising the medical entries in Locke&rsquo;s journals. Patrick
Romanell&rsquo;s <em>Locke and Medicine</em> (1984) began to draw out
the connections between Locke&rsquo;s medical work and his
philosophical views. In a series of books and articles in the 1990s,
Guy Meynell demonstrated the deep personal and professional
connections between Locke and Sydenham. More recently, J. C. Walmsley
has produced updated transcriptions of Locke&rsquo;s key medical
texts, and highlighted the close relationship between Locke&rsquo;s
medical work and the early versions of the <em>Essay</em>. Most
recently Peter Anstey&rsquo;s <em>John Locke and Natural
Philosophy</em> (2011b) has presented a detailed and rounded view of
Locke&rsquo;s medical interests and their impact on his philosophical
views (though his interpretation of the relationship between Locke and
Sydenham, and Locke&rsquo;s commitment to chymical theory, has drawn
commentary in Walmsley 2012 and 2016).</p>

<p>
Understanding the depth of Locke&rsquo;s medical research, and the way
that this research shaped his philosophical views, provides an insight
into the deep structure of his epistemological and metaphysical
outlook&mdash;both the underpinnings of his worldview, and his overall
methodology. So while Locke&rsquo;s work as a physician is not widely
known, his medical outlook is arguably the bedrock on which he built
the superstructure of his philosophy. This article traces
Locke&rsquo;s medical work through the earlier stages of career to
identify how his commitments changed over time and demonstrate how his
training as a physician shaped key philosophical principles in the
early drafts of the <em>Essay</em>, thereby laying the foundations for
his mature views.</p>

<h2 id="LockMediStudOxfo">1. Locke&rsquo;s Medical Studies at Oxford</h2>

<p>
In May 1652 Locke was elected to a Studentship at Christ Church,
Oxford. Locke does not appear to have thought much of his education
there. In his posthumous biography, Locke&rsquo;s friend Jean Le Clerc
described Locke&rsquo;s early career in Oxford as one focussed less on
learning, and more on epistolary entertainment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Being thus discourag&rsquo;d by the Method of studying that was then
in Vogue, he diverted himself by writing to some Gentlemen, with whom
he chose to hold Correspondence for the sake of their good Humour,
their pleasant and agreeable Temper, rather than on the Account of
their Learning; and he confess&rsquo;d that he spent some Years in
this manner. (Le Clerc 1713: 3&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On 14 February 1656 Locke received a Bachelor of Arts, and on the 29
June 1658, he obtained his Master of Arts. He then began to progress
through the academic hierarchy, becoming a Lecturer in Greek in 1660,
in Rhetoric in 1663, and Censor for Moral Philosophy in 1664.
Locke&rsquo;s tenure of the Studentship was life-long, dependent upon
certain conditions. If he married, if he failed to take a degree when
qualified to do so, or failed to take orders when of sufficient
seniority, he would have to leave. However, four Faculty Studentships,
divided between Law and Medicine, were exempt from ecclesiastical
obligations. Once Locke had his M.A. he could study whatever he liked,
and medicine might have provided a way to retain his position without
becoming a clergyman. From roughly the time of graduating M.A.
onwards, in addition to his academic duties, Locke undertook an
extensive programme of reading and note-taking which immersed him
deeply in the medical controversies of his day.</p>

<p>
Much of the teaching at the time remained Galenic in origin and Locke
read numerous thinkers in this tradition, like Glisson, Riverius,
Fernel and Moebius. The core Galenic ontology was classical in origin
and simple in explanatory structure. There were four elements: earth,
air, fire and water, four primary qualities: hot, cold, wet and dry,
four bodily humours: blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm, and
the three spirits; natural, vital and animal. To cure a disease in the
Galenic model was simple. If illness was due to some imbalance, the
application of opposing qualities would return things to order. Put
simply, &ldquo;contraries may be cured and resisted by their
contraries&rdquo;. In addition, Locke began a systematic study of
Daniel Sennert&rsquo;s thought. Sennert was not an orthodox Galenist.
He engaged in chemical experimentation and postulated corpuscles as
constituent parts of larger objects, holding that each corpuscle was a
compound of Aristotelean matter and form, and that the causal powers
of the corpuscle were dependent on this form. Moreover, all the
corpuscles in a body were arranged according to an overall form that
structured the macroscopic body (Newman 1996: 573&ndash;6). So,
despite his progressive outlook and modification of classical
thinking, Sennert retained a fundamental belief in traditional
explanatory categories. Locke took scores of notes from
Sennert&rsquo;s works, and even went so far as to adopt the structure
of his <em>Institutionum Medicinae</em> (1611) for a pair of large
medical notebooks in which he recorded observations from a wide range
of writers over several
 decades.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Locke also read several works by Anton Deusing, a polymath and medical
eclectic. Deusing kept up to date with the latest developments in
natural philosophy, reading Boyle, Descartes, and Harvey. But his
approach was generally to accommodate new discoveries within a
traditional framework. When studying the natural sciences he held that
the Bible was the first point of reference, then the classical
authors, where he favoured Aristotle in general, and Avicenna in
medical matters. For Deusing, though experience and experiment play a
role in the sciences, they should be balanced with the dictates of
reason which were at least as important. He generally adopted the most
conservative position consistent with the scientific discoveries of
his time. Locke read and took notes from at least 5 of Deusing&rsquo;s
books, and created his own manuscript indexes of at least two of them.
Locke was evidently immersed and clearly engaged with classical
medical theory then dominant at the time, and some of the newer, more
innovative, manifestations of its adherents.</p>

<p>
At the time of Locke&rsquo;s study, there was another major strand of
medical thinking evolving in contrast to the Galenic tradition, which
might be described as Paracelsian, or &ldquo;chymical&rdquo; medicine.
Paracelsus (c. 1493&ndash;1541), a Swiss physician, alchemist, and
philosopher, revolutionized medicine by advocating the use of
chemicals and minerals in treatments, and laying the groundwork for
modern pharmacology. &ldquo;Chymists&rdquo; rejected the matter and
form of the scholastics, replacing it with the paradigm of
&ldquo;fermentation&rdquo;. Here, organic phenomena such as the
spontaneous generation of heat from straw-piles, or the creation of
alcohol from hops and yeast were seen as pointers to an underlying
dynamic and transformative <em>modus operandi</em> in nature.</p>

<p>
A leading thinker in that tradition was then resident in
Oxford&mdash;Thomas Willis, Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy.
Some of Locke&rsquo;s earliest medical notes after his M.A. come from
Willis&rsquo;s <em>Diatribe duae medico-philosophicae</em> (London
1659). Locke also attended Willis&rsquo;s 1662 medical lectures, some
of the notes deriving from his schoolfriend Richard Lower, who would
shortly act as Willis&rsquo;s assistant in the preparation of
<em>Cerebri Anatome</em> (London 1664) (Willis&rsquo;s c. 1662 lecture
notes are printed in Dewhurst 1980). In Willis&rsquo;s view,
macroscopic objects were made up of tiny parts. However, each of these
particles has its own separate chemical identity, over and above its
purely mechanical attributes. There were five different types of body
in Willis&rsquo;s opinion: spirit, sulphur, salt, water and earth. A
particle of spirit would always be very active and volatile,
irrespective of its size and shape, while one of earth would be inert.
Change occurred when particles of one type were joined to particles of
another. Willis called this chymical process of particular
re-arrangement, a &ldquo;fermentation&rdquo; (Frank 1980:
165&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
Locke also studied the work of another major figure in this tradition.
Joan Baptista van Helmont, reading his major work, <em>Ortus
Medicinae</em> at least twice&mdash;the 1648 edition <em>circa</em>
1660&ndash;1661 and the 1652 edition at points between 1665 and 1667,
using the book itself to make notes (Walmsley 2000: 370). Van Helmont
believed that all matter was derived from water and that
&ldquo;ferments&rdquo; impregnated different parts of water with
&ldquo;seeds&rdquo; that transformed it into irreducibly different
chymical elements by imposing an image or &ldquo;idea&rdquo; upon it.
Helmont held that when elements truly reacted together, they were
transmuted into an entirely new third substance sharing no properties
with its antecedents. Helmont also believed that bodies contained
&ldquo;Archei&rdquo;&mdash;quasi-spiritual entities that governed the
operation of different organs (Pagel 1982). Disease occurred when a
ferment, or &ldquo;seminal principle&rdquo; attempted to direct the
matter of the body in some way other than that planned by the Archeus.
Locke read several other authors in this tradition, including Kerger
and Schookius.</p>

<p>
As well as immersing himself in &ldquo;chymical&rdquo; theory, Locke
embarked upon a practical course of &ldquo;chymistry&rdquo; taught by
Peter Stahl. Stahl had been brought to England by Robert Boyle in 1659
and was the first person to publicly teach chemistry at Oxford
(Meynell 1995). Anthony Wood famously recorded his impression of the
young Locke&rsquo;s contributions to the classes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This John Lock was a man of turbulent spirit, clamorous and never
contented. The club wrot and took notes from the mouth of their
master, who sate at the upper end of a table, but the said J. Lock
scorned to do it; so that while every man besides of the club were
writing, he would be prating and troblesome. (Wood c. 1672
[1891&ndash;5: vol. I, 472]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The extensive notes that Locke took in in a new commonplace book
rather undercuts Wood&rsquo;s unflattering portrait, and Locke would
continue to record his own extensive on-going chymical experimentation
in Oxford over the next several years (as detailed in Walmsley &amp;
Milton 1999).</p>

<p>
Throughout this period and in parallel to these other medical
traditions, Locke was also assiduously studied the mechanical
philosophy. Locke had met Robert Boyle by 1660, who was by then an
experienced experimenter at the outset of a publishing career that
would establish him as the leading natural philosopher of his day.
Locke read Boyle&rsquo;s works as they were published, starting with
the <em>New Experiments Physico-Mechanical touching the Spring of
Air</em> (Oxford 1660), and continuing with <em>Certain Physiological
Essays</em> (London 1661), <em>The Style of the Scriptures</em>
(London 1661), <em>The Usefulness of Experimental Natural
Philosophy</em> (Oxford 1663), and <em>The Origine of Formes and
Qualities</em> (Oxford 1666). An exception was <em>The Sceptical
Chymist</em> (London 1661), which was published in 1661, but not read
by Locke until circa 1664&ndash;5 (Milton 1994: 37).</p>

<p>
From 1660 to 1662, Locke also pursued a systematic examination
Descartes&rsquo; work. He started with the <em>Principles of
Philosophy</em>, then read the <em>Discourse on Method</em>, the
<em>Dioptrics</em> and <em>Meteors</em>, the <em>Meditations</em>,
some of the <em>Objections and Replies</em> and finally, the
<em>Passions of the Soul</em>. Locke then read some of
Gassendi&rsquo;s <em>Syntagma</em>, and Spinoza&rsquo;s
re-construction of the Cartesian system, <em>Renati des Cartes
Principorum Philosophiae Pars I, and II, More Geometrico
demonstratae</em> in 1664 (this account drawn from Milton 1994:
37&ndash;9). Locke&rsquo;s notes on the mechanical philosophy were
generally confined to the natural philosophical matters of fact that
might interest a physician-in-training. Locke&rsquo;s reading of
Descartes appears to have been the inspiration for two short notes in
his commonplace books. In the first, &ldquo;Vacuum&rdquo;, Locke
considered whether solidity requires a vacuum, or whether motion
provides an explanation (Locke c. 1662a). In the second,
&ldquo;Elasticus Motus&rdquo;, Locke speculates on the properties of
motion (Locke c. 1662b [2001: 221&ndash;2]).</p>

<p>
From 1660 to 1666 Locke became systematically and deeply immersed in
the medical theories and controversies of his day, filling his
notebooks with his reading and experimental findings. His interests
were eclectic. While modern readers might most closely associate him
with the mechanical philosophy, this was far from his sole interest in
this period, as he engaged deeply with both the Galenic and Chymical
medical traditions.</p>

<h2 id="LockPhys">2. Locke on Physiology</h2>

<p>
In June 1664 Richard Lower wrote to Robert Boyle concerning some
physiological problems he was then grappling with, specifically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the reasons of the different colour of the blood of the veins and
arteries; the one being florid and purple red, the other dark and
blackish. (Boyle 2001: II, 288)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Galenic theory had supposed that the veins and arteries were entirely
separate systems; the veins distributing nutritive blood containing
natural spirits generated in the liver, the arteries distributing
vital spirits generated in the heart. The only point of contact
between the two systems was at the heart, where venous blood was
supposed to pass directly from the right to the left ventricle, so
that blood was available for the creation of the vital spirits. The
air was supposed to cool the heat of the heart, and take away the
waste products of the venous blood. Harvey&rsquo;s discovery of the
circulation of the blood had overturned this orthodoxy, raising
questions about the nature of blood, its relationship to the air, and
what role the heart and lungs played in this circulation. A full
account of the impact of Harvey&rsquo;s discovery is presented in
Frank (1980).</p>

<p>
When Lower recommenced his research on respiration and the blood in
1664, Locke worked with him. Locke made numerous notes on respiration,
volatility and fermentation, focussing on experimental research and
often citing Lower as a source. One such note outlined the key
question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Sanguis</em> Bloud taken out of the veines and arteries of the
same creature at the same time very much differs. that that comes out
of an opend veine being the greatst part of it of a darke colour which
they commonly call crassamentum nigrum with a florid red about the
thicknesse of half a crowne on the top. that which comes out of an
opend atrerie is all of that florid colour without any Crassamentum
nigrum R.Lower. (Locke 1664&ndash;6 [2007: 462])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke then speculated about the possible cause:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Sanguis</em> Bloud taken out of the artery of the lungs hath its
crassamentum nigrum like that which comes out of the vains so that the
red florid is made only in the left ventricle of the heart RL which
perhaps is by the mixture of the aire with it which gives it
volatilization &amp; colour. (Locke 1664&ndash;6 [2007: 462])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke erroneously thought that the blood travelling from lungs to
heart was identical to venous blood, leaving some role for the heart
in its volatization. Locke then turned to the experimental evidence
from Helmont:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Sal Volatile</em> Helmont Blas humanum n.35.p.150.52 where he says
that the aire makes that all the bloud transpires &amp; becomes
volatile, but being distild leaves a caput mortum But that he says n45
that the aier volatizing the sulphur of any concrete, all the alkali
will become a volatile salt. Query How the aier may be soe applyd as
to effect this whither by expressing to it or fermenting in it. JL.
(Locke 1664&ndash;6 [2007: 462])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke then theorised about what it was in the air that made the blood
volatile:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Sanguis</em> Aer probably it is the nitrous salt in the aier that
gives it this tincture &amp; volatizes it, &amp; the volatile part in
circulation being either transmuted into nourishment of the part, the
remaining bloud in the vains is lesse spirituosus &amp; both in colour
&amp; consistence comes nearer a caput mortuum, &amp; therefor is
returnd by the vains to the lungues &amp; heart to be new volatilizd
&amp; soe by sucession is made all volatile JL. v. Helmont Blas hum.
n.35. p150. 52 Destill ana of the venall &amp; arteriall bloud of an
animall &amp; try whether they will yeild different quantitys of Salt.
JL. (Locke 1664&ndash;6 [2007: 463]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A nitrous salt in the air volatised the blood to provide nourishment
for the body. Once the body consumed the volatile part of the blood,
it was sent back to the lungs and heart to be volatised again to
provide a continuous supply of bodily sustenance. Locke even suggested
a test for this theory&mdash;ascertain whether the venous and arterial
blood have different levels of salt to indicate different levels of
volatility.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s studentship required him to submit a disputation on a
medical topic, and this may have prompted his paper
&ldquo;Respirationis Usus&rdquo;, written mid-1666. He opened his
disputation with a direct attack on Galenic orthodoxy: &ldquo;Would
the primary purpose of respiration be to cool the blood? No&rdquo;
(Locke 1666a [2009: 15]). Locke was prepared to agree that
&ldquo;nature seems to work greatly to this effect, that that vestal
fire of our life is cherished&rdquo;, but did not think that the lungs
cooled this internal flame:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
would Nature not be a badly wasteful Matron if she aroused such great
fires in us that it would be continually necessary for her to blow
cold airs through us to prevent us from being burned up? (Locke 1666a
[2009: 17])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke held that life and animation were constituted by &ldquo;animal
spirits&rdquo;. These required volatisation and
&ldquo;ascension&rdquo; by the air, then to be transported around the
body in the blood to keep all parts alive:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For seeing that it is upon this that animal life hinges, that there
should be a continuous and constant provision of animal spirits, that
is, that the parts of the blood should be changed into a subtle and
volatile material, which, when diffused everywhere throughout our
arteries and nerves, imparts motion, feeling and heat to the body;
which appears to be the fundamental reason and whole driving force of
our life. (Locke 1666a [2009: 19])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke supported his theory with experimental results. He first noted
that air was &ldquo;indispensable in order to both ferment and
volatize things&rdquo; (Locke 1666a [2009: 19]). Locke next considered
the specific processes at work, proposing a candidate for the active
agent in the air:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If one can conjecture something in such obscurity, this sort of spirit
has a highly volatile nitrous nature (not unskilled would be those who
suspected they saw salt-peter), which seems to be the proper dissolver
of sulphurous and inflammable bodies. (Locke 1666a [2009: 21])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These nitrous particles:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
necessary to the conservation of our life and the volatility of our
blood, we inhale and imbibe together with the air. Whence the little
fire of our life is continuously inflamed in our heart. (Locke 1666a
[2009: 21])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke had identified the end and means of the blood&rsquo;s
volatization and, consequently, the purpose of respiration, thereby
overturning the Galenic view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This volatization is caused by fermentation and a kind of burning in
the heart. But no kindling of this kind, be it fermentation or
whatever we are permitted to call it, takes place without air itself.
We conclude therefore that the air effectively kindles the
heart&rsquo;s heat rather than cools it. (Locke 1666a [2009: 21])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke then sought to corroborate his theory, and refute Galenic
cooling, with a wide variety of examples. Locke finally tackled
potential objections to his theory by showing why, when circulation
increases in exercise or fever, respiration must also increase: that
the lungs should not be overwhelmed with blood, and that the blood
should be fully impregnated with the aerial ferment, so that it is
sufficiently nourishing for the body when it circulates (Locke 1666a
[2009: 21&ndash;7]).</p>

<p>
The September 1667 edition of the <em>Philosophical Transactions of
the Royal Society of London</em> printed &ldquo;<em>An Experiment
of</em> Signior Fracassati <em>upon Bloud grown cold</em>&rdquo;.
Blood at the top of a dish would be a florid red, in contrast to the
blood below it. But once the florid layer was removed, the blood below
would redden, showing that the air directly volatized the blood. This
experiment prompted Locke to reconsider the theory he had proposed in
&ldquo;Respirationis usus&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the melancholy bloud exposed to the aer turns florid (v. phil
transact p 493) it seemes to prove that the aire in breatheing mixes
with the blood since the arteriall bloud in animals is much more
florid then the venall. JL (Locke 1667 [2009: 8])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was this result would reshape Lower&rsquo;s thinking in his
<em>Tractatus de Corde</em> concerning the location of the
volatisation of the blood, placing it exclusively in the lungs
directly from the air (Lower 1669), the first published account of the
basic mechanisms of physiology and the respective roles of the heart,
lungs, veins, arteries and respiration. Locke&rsquo;s instant grasp of
the importance and implications of the Fracassati experiment allowed
him to put the final piece of the physiological puzzle in place. Locke
had now formulated the basic elements, machinery and purpose of
respiration, ahead of the appearance of Lower&rsquo;s
<em>Tractatus</em>. Had he published a short summary of his thinking
on respiration before Lower&rsquo;s book, it might have secured him a
place in the history of medicine as a physiologist at the cutting-edge
of contemporary research.</p>

<p>
Two further points are notable&mdash;a reliance upon Helmontian,
&ldquo;chymical&rdquo; theory, and a commensurate distance from the
work of Boyle. Boyle in the <em>New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall,
Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects</em> thought it likely
that the air took off fumes from the blood, and unlikely that the
&ldquo;chymical&rdquo; supposition that there was a &ldquo;vital
Quintessence&rdquo; in the air necessary for life (Boyle 1660:
273&shy;&ndash;95). Locke thought the opposite.</p>

<h2 id="LockEarlTheoDise">3. Locke Early Theory of Disease</h2>

<p>
In addition to his work on respiration, Locke also wrote
&ldquo;Morbus&rdquo;, a short reflection on the nature of disease.
Where &ldquo;Respirationis Usus&rdquo; was implicitly premised on
&ldquo;chymical&rdquo; theory, &ldquo;Morbus&rdquo; explicitly adopted
an Helmontian ontology as part of an eclectic theory of disease. And
where the disputation had tacitly rejected Boyle&rsquo;s mechanical
explanations, &ldquo;Morbus&rdquo; directly rejected some of the
accounts Boyle gave for specific phenomena. The opening remarks gave
the central thesis of his account:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I suppose another &amp; more rationall theory of deseases might be
establishd upon other principles, then those either of the Galenests
or Paracelsians, for Considering that in the greate world some things
are producd by seminall principles, &amp; some other by bare mistion
of the parts, to which might be added the circumstantiall assistances
of heat &amp; cold &amp;c. (Locke 1666b [2000: 390&ndash;1])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s stated intent was to replace the dispute between the
Paracelsians and the Galenists. But this was quickly belied by the
substance of his account which broadly comprised Helmontian
&ldquo;seminal principles&rdquo; tempered by Galenic
&ldquo;humours&rdquo;. His intention was not to create a new ontology,
but to adapt elements of these theories and determine their domains of
applicability. That Locke was not invoking the mechanical hypothesis
in positing &ldquo;seminall principles&rdquo; was clear when he
defined this technical phrase:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
by seminall principles or ferments I meane some small &amp; subtile
parcelles of matter which are apt to transmute far greater portions of
matter into a new nature &amp; new qualitys, which change could not be
brought about by any other knowne means, soe that this change seems
wholy to depend upon the operation or activity of this seminall
principle, &amp; not on the difference of the matter its self that is
changd. (Locke 1666b [2000: 391])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, Locke adopted specifically Helmontian terms of art when
indicating how these ferments worked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
How these small &amp; insensible ferments, this potent Archeus works I
confesse I cannot satisfactorily comprehend, though the effects are
evident. (Locke 1666b [2000: 391])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This statement is unequivocal in its adherence to Helmontian ontology:
Locke even used the central term of this theory, the
&ldquo;Archeus&rdquo;. Accounting for his acceptance of Helmontian
theory, Locke used the example that provided a paradigm for the rest
of the theory, namely, the &ldquo;seed&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
soe severall seeds set in the same plot of earth, change the moisture
of the earth which is the common nourishment of them all into far
different plants which, differ both in their qualitys &amp; effects.
(Locke 1666b [2000: 391])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke then stated that this power of creating different plants from
qualitatively indistinguishable seeds &ldquo;is not donne by bare
streineing the nourishment through their pores&rdquo;, an allusion to
the mechanical explanations of both Descartes and Boyle. Locke gave an
organic example, drawing on experimental results where plant seeds
were placed in water:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the conversion of the same water into divers plants of different
kindes as mint &amp; marjorame &amp;c, cannot be effectd by barely
straineing it through the different pores of those plants, but must be
wrought by some more powerfull way, then bare streineing is able to
produce in soe simple &amp; homogeneous a body. (Locke 1666b [2000:
391])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a reference to Boyle&rsquo;s experiments on growing precisely
these plants in water from <em>The Sceptical Chymist</em> (Boyle 1661:
110&ndash;11). Boyle had cited these examples as illustrations of
mechanical explanations; Locke cited them to support an opposing
Helmontian account.</p>

<p>
Locke then re-introduced the concept of &ldquo;humours&rdquo;, not as
the cause of disease when qualities are imbalanced, but as a factor in
susceptibility to the agency of ferments:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
soe sanguine complexions are observd most easily to admit the seminall
principles of the plague easily melancholy tempers more difficultly.
&amp; in all these seminall deseases the fault seems noe otherwise to
be in the bloud &amp; humors then as they are more or lesse disposd to
receive &amp; nourish this seminall principle. (Locke 1666b [2000:
392])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With this Galenic concept assimilated into his neo-Helmontian theory,
Locke then considered non-seminal diseases, those maladies caused by a
&ldquo;bare mistion of parts&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Other deseases I suppose may probably be conceivd to be producd by a
bare mistion of two unfitt ingredient, as when acid &amp; volatile
salts are mixd, there presently is producd an ebullition, &amp; then
the two differing salts coagulate into a 3d substance far enough
different from either of the ingredients. (Locke 1666b [2000:
392])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke here describes a &ldquo;chymical&rdquo; transmutation of two
substances into an third from which its predecessors cannot be
recovered. For Locke, even the most basic of inorganic interactions,
Boyle&rsquo;s strongest case for a mechanical explanation, were to be
accounted for in terms of irreducibly &ldquo;chymical&rdquo;
interactions, rather than the texture of mechanical parts.</p>

<p>
At this point in his career Locke had a voracious interest in a wide
range of medical matters, which extended into practical physiological
and &ldquo;chymical&rdquo; experimentation. He was a medical eclectic,
willing to countenance a wide range of contemporary explanations for
medical, and by extension, natural, phenomena. Such catholic interests
did not evidence a philosophically principled approach to medical
matters. Readers of the <em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em>
will be very familiar with Locke&rsquo;s account of the mechanical
philosophy, and its most famous expression, the distinction between
primary and secondary qualities. They will know that Locke and Boyle
were close associates from the 1660s onwards, and will assume that
Locke&rsquo;s views derived directly from Boyle&rsquo;s. A review of
Locke&rsquo;s early medical work shows this to be incorrect; at this
early point in his career Locke was much more a &ldquo;chymist&rdquo;
than a mechanist, deeply immersed in an Helmontian ontology at odds
with Boyle&rsquo;s mechanism. Locke and Boyle shared interests, and
worked closely together, but Locke had an independent intellectual
agenda which he pursued with vigour.</p>

<h2 id="LockSyde">4. Locke and Sydenham</h2>

<p>
On 2 April 1668 the physician Thomas Sydenham sent Boyle a letter
concerning the second edition of <em>Thomae Sydenham Methodus Curandi
Febres, Propriis Observationibus Superstructura</em>. Boyle had been
inspiration, and subsequently the dedicatee, of the first edition of
1666. In this letter, Sydenham sought permission to reprint the
dedication, and updated Boyle with news of a mutual acquaintance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I perceive my friend, Mr. <em>Locke</em>, hath troubled you with an
account of my practice, as he hath done himself in visiting with me
very many of my variolous patients especially. (Boyle 2001: IV,
55)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke had left Oxford in April 1667 to take up residence in London
with his new patron, Anthony Ashley Cooper. Locke appears to have made
Sydenham&rsquo;s acquaintance shortly thereafter, and since Boyle knew
both men, it is possible that he effected the introduction.</p>

<p>
Roughly translated, the title of the book was &ldquo;Thomas
Sydenham&rsquo;s method for the treatment of fevers based upon his own
observations&rdquo;. Sydenham believed that there was no way for
people to determine the causes of illness: these &ldquo;cannot be laid
down&rdquo; (Sydenham 1666 [1987: 59]). Consequently, &ldquo;Aetiology
is a difficult, and, perhaps, an inexplicable affair; and I choose to
keep my hands clear of it&rdquo; (Sydenham 1666 [1987: 103]). So,
rather than engage in the construction of hypotheses about the
constitution of the body or disease, the book presented only a minimal
theoretical structure and avoided the theoretical disputes of
competing medical factions. In this respect it differed radically from
most medical literature of the time.</p>

<p>
Sydenham believed that there were &ldquo;species of fever&rdquo; which
acted in a constant and systematic way (Sydenham, 1666 [1987: 55]):
&ldquo;Nature here as elsewhere, moves in a regular and orderly
manner&rdquo; (Sydenham 1666 [1987: 103]). But he had no interest in
speculating about the underlying cause of the different fevers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if any one, I say, requires an answer upon all these points, I am
ready to confess my ignorance. No one, that I know of, has hitherto
gone far enough in such matters to flatter himself for having solved
these problems of Nature. For my own part, I am not ambitious of the
name of a Philosopher, and those who think themselves so, may,
perhaps, consider me blameable on the score of my not having attempted
to pierce these mysteries. (Sydenham 1666: [1987: 101])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rather, than attempt to unravel these mysteries, Sydenham held we must
first determine what type of fever it is that is afflicting a patient,
and then find out what method of cure is best suited to removing this
fever. The content of Sydenham&rsquo;s book was the product of this
exercise, executed by careful observation of patients and the
effectiveness of treatment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To some it may appear that the method which I adopt is based upon
insecure foundations. I am, however, on my part, fully convinced, and
I truly affirm, that it [is] altogether proved by a manifest
experience. (Sydenham 1666 [1987: 9])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sydenham rested his whole case in support of his methods upon the fact
that he had seen such treatments being effective in a large number of
cases:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To bring the discussion to an end at last, I allow myself to add that
the general method already described embraces the treatment of all
kinds of fevers as far as I have been able to make out by careful
observation. (Sydenham 1666 [1987: 63&ndash;5])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sydenham was adamant that his was the only way that progress would be
made in the treatment of illness. For example, experience showed that
a cooling treatment for smallpox was most successful. This was
anathema to the established medical profession, who held that warming
the patient would encourage the expulsion of the morbific matter and
expedite the patient&rsquo;s return to health. For them, a cooling of
the patient was potentially fatal. Sydenham had essentially dismissed
theorising as a basis of medical practice, and replaced it with what
might be described as a robust clinical empiricism&mdash;undermining
long-held contemporary medical theory and the integrity of the
established medical profession.</p>

<p>
The <em>Methodus</em> was, in essence, a record of Sydenham&rsquo;s
efforts to identify different species of disease and their most
effective method of cure. Locke had read the book shortly after its
publication, and had taken extensive notes on it. By 1668, Locke had
made Sydenham&rsquo;s acquaintance, and was evidently impressed with
his new medical colleague and his approach to medicine. James Tyrrell
would later relate how much of an impact Sydenham had on Locke (and
his friend David Thomas):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
He became obsessed with Dr Sydenham, next to whom Dr Lower was
esteemed a dunce and was not even credited with common sense. Dr
Thomas, the physician from Salisbury, was no less admiring &hellip;
This obsession made Lord Shaftesbury often compare them to three
fanatics who travelled to Rome; two of them saying that the third was
the Holy Spirit. (Tyrrell 1718&ndash;19 [2021: 275])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s previous interest in medicine appears to have been
largely academic. While he had undertaken some work in experimental
chemistry and may have participated in some of Lower&rsquo;s
physiological experimentation, there is no record of his having
treated an actual patient prior to meeting Sydenham. Now he was
accompanying Sydenham on his rounds and would take on his own
patients, making detailed notes on their individual case histories.
Over the next several years, Locke would provide extensive support to
Sydenham&rsquo;s project.</p>

<p>
The second edition of the <em>Methodus</em> contained an extended
section on the treatment of the plague where Sydenham re-emphasised
his critique of academic medicine and its preference for theoretical
speculation over effective practice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I have ever held that any accession whatever to the art of healing,
even if it went no further than the cutting of corns or the curing of
toothaches, was of far higher value than all the knowledge of fine
points and all the pomp of subtle speculations; matters which are as
useful to the physician in driving away diseases as music is to masons
in laying bricks. (Sydenham 1668 [1987: 215])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Sydenham, you don&rsquo;t need to know the cause of the disease,
you simply need to find out what cures it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the questions as to how we can cure diseases, whilst we know nothing
of their causes, gives us no trouble. It is not by the knowledge of
causes but by that of methods at once suitable and approved by
experience that the cure of the majority of diseases is accomplished.
(Sydenham 1668 [1987: 177])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Regarding his recommendation of venesection as a treatment for the
plague, he relied upon a close examination of the disease itself,
rather than theories about it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Within a short period I had seen several cases; and it was with no
small surprise that I discovered that this fever simulated the
character and nature of the fever that I had &hellip; so successfully
treated. This enabled me to prefer my own experience to any
theoretical precepts. (Sydenham 1668 [1987: 205])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Observation and effectiveness were the touchstones of medical
practice.</p>

<p>
In addition to this new section, the book also presented a poem of
fulsome praise for Sydenham&rsquo;s approach to medicine signed
&ldquo;J. LOCK A. M. ex Aede Christi Oxon&rdquo;, attributing to
Sydenham an &ldquo;equally amazing skill and success&rdquo; and
stating that Sydenham&rsquo;s prescription of venesection had brought
the plague under control:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Who would believe in Plague subdued at last, mastered by our Art and
now bereft of all its ancient threats? After deaths in thousands, with
graves heaped up with the dead, the dreaded scourge lies conquered by
a little wound. (Sydenham 1668 [1987: 227&ndash;8])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Earlier physicians had been hampered by the obscurity of the
disease&rsquo;s aetiology: &ldquo;The Physician ponders the
Fever&rsquo;s cause and course, the darkness of flames and burning
without light&rdquo;. Sydenham took another path:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
SYDENHAM, at last, opposing both Fever and the Schools, both fever
probed and treatment understood. Not for him, fires of occult
corruption or those &ldquo;humours&rdquo; that breed fevers &hellip;
Not for him those squabbles whose heat exceeds the fires. (Sydenham
1668 [1987: 228])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke had quickly assimilated the essential elements of
Sydenham&rsquo;s therapeutics. Further, as G. G. Meynell (1993) has
argued, Locke was the likely source of a set of references to authors
who agreed with Sydenham&rsquo;s regimen for the plague.</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1669, Sydenham contemplated a new work based upon his
continued observations on smallpox. Stylometric analysis demonstrates
that the manuscript Epistolary Dedication to Shaftesbury, and Preface,
both in Locke&rsquo;s hand, but both written in the first person from
Sydenham&rsquo;s perspective, were jointly authored by both Locke and
Sydenham (Burrows &amp; Anstey 2013). Locke was here helping to
compose a justification for Sydenham&rsquo;s approach to the treatment
of the disease, and defend him against the censures of the
contemporary medical profession. Around the same time Locke also
drafted two extended medical essays, &ldquo;Anatomia&rdquo; in 1668 on
the limited utility of anatomy for medicine, and &ldquo;De Arte
Medica&rdquo; in 1669 on the practice of medicine more generally. Both
are in Locke&rsquo;s hand, and stylometric analysis confirms Locke as
their sole author (Anstey &amp; Burrows 2009), but both were
apparently written to defend Sydenham&rsquo;s medical methodology.
Indeed, &ldquo;Anatomia&rdquo; begins with an interpolated sentence in
Sydenham&rsquo;s hand written in the first person, framing the essay
as part of a larger treatise.</p>

<p>
This larger treatise might also have been the reason that
Sydenham&rsquo;s projected work on Smallpox did not appear. Sydenham
was reformulating his views on disease, supposing that each year had
its own epidemic &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; (Bates 1975: Part II,
61&ndash;140). He set about a more comprehensive treatment of disease
over several years from 1667 to 1674 and assembled his extended
clinical observations in a large vellum-bound manuscript collection of
essays entitled <em>Medical Observations</em> (Royal College of
Physicians MS 572 (Sydenham 1667&ndash;74 [1991])). The early essays
begin with different disease species, their symptoms and most
effective method of cure, but as the manuscript continues, diseases
are grouped together into constitutions. Indeed, Sydenham&rsquo;s
essay &ldquo;Small Pox of the years 1667 &amp; 1668&rdquo; represented
the first example of such a constitution (Sydenham 1667&ndash;74
[1991: 68&ndash;98]). There are approximately fifty separable essays
in the <em>Medical Observations</em> written over 60 folio leaves
(Sydenham 1667&ndash;74 [1991: 8&ndash;9]). Locke was intimately
involved in the production of this manuscript, writing out ten of
these essays in the manuscript in his own hand, comprising roughly one
sixth of the text of the manuscript as a whole. Elsewhere in the
manuscript he read and corrected Sydenham&rsquo;s work, as Sydenham
likewise corrected his. Amongst Locke&rsquo;s papers in the Bodleian
Library, there are numerous manuscripts copies of Sydenham&rsquo;s
essays from the &ldquo;Medical Observations&rdquo;. Seven are rough,
corrected copies, which Locke had evidently made at Sydenham&rsquo;s
dictation. In addition Locke made fair copies of thirty four of the
essays from the &ldquo;Medical Observations&rdquo;, the last,
&ldquo;Epidemicall diseases of the yeare 1670&rdquo;, copied in the
spring of 1671 (Sydenham 1667&ndash;74 [1991: 150&ndash;60]).</p>

<p>
Combined with the text of the <em>Methodus</em>, the manuscript
&ldquo;Medical Observations&rdquo; formed the basis of
Sydenham&rsquo;s 1676 <em>Observationes Medicae</em>, a hugely
influential work which would eventually secure Sydenham&rsquo;s
reputation, become a standard medical textbook and a landmark in
therapeutics. Sydenham heaped praise on Locke in the preface to the
<em>Observationes</em>, stating that he</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
agrees with me as to the method that I am speaking of; a man who, in
the acuteness of his intellect, in the steadiness of his judgement, in
the simplicity (and by simplicity I mean excellence) of his manners,
has, amongst the present generation, few equals and no superiors. This
praise I may confidently attach to the name of JOHN LOCKE. (Sydenham
1676 [1848: vol. I, 6])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is difficult overstate the proximity and intimacy of the working
relationship between Locke and Sydenham in this period. From 1667 to
1671, Locke worked day-by-day, side-by-side with a radical medical
empiricist who believed that you could not speculate about what
existed beyond the symptoms of a disease, so you should instead create
its natural history based solely on what you can observe. Locke acted
as Sydenham&rsquo;s amanuensis and his apologist in this period, and
played a long-standing, direct, personal, practical and justificative
role in the writing and publication of one of modern medicine&rsquo;s
foundational texts.</p>

<h2 id="LockPracMedi">5. Locke on the Practice of Medicine</h2>

<p>
This &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; with Sydenham had a significant impact on
Locke&rsquo;s views about the practice of medicine. In Oxford he had
worked closely with Lower on physiology and described an eclectic
theory of disease based on contemporary medical theory. The essays
&ldquo;Anatomia&rdquo; and &ldquo;De Arte Medica&rdquo; presented
substantially different views.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anatomia&rdquo; concerns the utility of anatomical knowledge in
the practice of medicine. Excepting gross anatomy for surgeons, Locke
thought anatomy of little use to the practising physician because</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is certainly some thing more subtile &amp; fine then what our
senses can take cognisance of that is the cause of the disease, they
are the invisible &amp; insensible spirits that governe preserve &amp;
disorder the aeconomie of the body. (Locke 1668 [2014: fo. 35v])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke now evinced an insuperable pessimism about human ability to
penetrate into natural causes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is certaine &amp; beyond controversy that nature perform all her
operations in the body by parts soe minute. &amp; insensible that I
thinke noe body will ever hope or pretend even by the assistance of
glasses or any other invention to come to a sight of them. (Locke 1668
[2014: fo. 31r])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consequently, there is no way to determine the causes of disease:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
and to tell us what organicall texture or what kinde of ferment (for
whether it be donne by one or both of these ways is yet a question
&amp; like to be soe alway notwithstanding all the endeavours of the
most accurate dissections) separates any part of the juices in any of
the viscera, or tell us of what figures the particles of those juices
are or if this could be donne (which yet is never like to be) would it
at all contribute to the cure of the diseases. (Locke 1668 [2014: fo.
31r-v])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke alludes to both mechanical &ldquo;textures&rdquo; and Helmontian
&ldquo;ferments&rdquo;, supposing we will never be able to determine
which is operative. Instead Locke urged physicians to use clinical
experience, rather than speculative theory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
how regulate his dose, to mix his simples &amp; to prescribe all in a
due method, all this is only from history &amp; the advantage of a
diligent observation of these diseases, of their begining progresse
&amp; ways of cure. (Locke 1668 [2014: fo. 31v])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To illustrate his point, Locke turned to the example of respiration, a
subject on which he had recently been undertaking cutting edge
research with his colleague Richard Lower. He now presented a very
different perspective:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
whether respiration serve to coole the bloud, or give vent to its
vapours, or to adde a ferment to it, or to pound &amp; mix its minute
particles or whether any thing else is in dispute amongst the learned
from whose controversys about it are like to arise rather more doubts
then any cleare determination of the point &amp; all that anatomy has
donne in this case as well as severall others is but to offer new
conjectures &amp; fresh matter for endlesse disputations. (Locke 1668
[2014: fo. 33v])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What he had previously been deeply engaged upon only a few years
prior, he now deemed largely pointless, again rejecting a range of
theoretical explanations: Galenic cooling, Helmontian ferments or
mechanical &ldquo;pounding &amp; mixing&rdquo;. We cannot understand
nature&rsquo;s operations, so these attempted explanations are otiose.
Such a change of attitude might explain why, according to Tyrrell,
Locke now regarded Lower as a &ldquo;dunce&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Locke was now insistent that we cannot penetrate into nature&rsquo;s
causation, and, as such, attempted theoretical explanations are
meaningless:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Ther is some thing therefor in the body &amp; the juices too curious
&amp; fine for us to discerne which performes the offices in the
severall parts governs the health &amp; produces the various motions
in the body &hellip; Therefor this hidden

 an expression however, obscure &amp; insignificant more like to give
us a usefull notion of the thing, then the anatomist to shew us this
archeus by which name Helmont has as clearely &amp; intelligibly
explaind it to us as Aristotle by his description. (Locke 1668 [2014:
fo. 36v])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Where Locke had previously endorsed the &ldquo;archeus&rdquo; as an
explanation of disease, he now dismissed it as &ldquo;obscure and
unintelligible&rdquo;. It is notable that this dismissal of both
Aristotle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;&delta;&eta;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&gamma;&#8056;&sigmaf;&rdquo;
and Helmont&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em lang="la">archeus</em>&rdquo; is
grounded upon both concepts being &ldquo;out of the reach of the
senses&rdquo; and therefore the &ldquo;apprehension&rdquo;. This
presupposes a substantive empiricism as the grounding of meaningful
explanation&mdash;if a concept is not derived from the senses, it is
&ldquo;obscure &amp; insignificant&rdquo; and cannot have meaning.
Further, it places such concepts &ldquo;out of the reach&rdquo; of our
apprehension, meaning they cannot &ldquo;intelligibly&rdquo; explain
anything.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;De Arte Medica&rdquo; took a broader view of the practice of
medicine, but the basic outline of the critique was identical:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Learned men of former ages imploid a great part of their time &amp;
thoughts in searching out the hidden causes of distempers, were
curious in imagining the secret workemanship of nature &amp; the
severall unperceptible tooles wherwith she wrought, &amp; puting all
these phansies togeather fashioned to them selves systems &amp;
hypotheses. (Locke 1669 [2014: fo. 49r])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But this is all lost labour, because we will never be able to know the
causes of disease:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it being perhaps noe absurdity to thinke that this great &amp; curious
fabrique of the world the workemanship of the almighty cannot be
perfectly comprehended by any understandg but his that made it. (Locke
1669 [2014: fo. 53r])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God&rsquo;s work in nature is simply beyond human comprehension. Locke
consequently endorsed an empirical, rather than theoretical, approach
to medicine</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the begining &amp; improvemt, of useful arts, &amp; the assistances of
human life, have all sprung from industry &amp; observacon true
knowled grew first in the world, by experience &amp; rationall
operations &amp; had this method beene continued &amp; all mens
thoughts beene imploid to adde their owne tryalls to the observation
of others noe question physick as well as many other arts, had been in
a far better condition then now it is. (Locke 1669 [2014: fo.
52r])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These medical essays present a new approach to medicine, based upon a
new set of premises. First, Locke places a significant emphasis upon
the evidence of the senses&mdash;theories not based in sensory
evidence are dismissed as meaningless. Second, Locke sets very strict
limits on the scope of human knowledge, holding that we will simply
never be able to penetrate into nature&rsquo;s operations, because
no-one but God can fully understand God&rsquo;s creation.
Consequently, third, speculation about the unobservable causes of
disease are at best wasted and at worst both meaningless and
misleading. This rules out both classical medical theorising and more
recent innovations like the chymical theories of Helmont. So, fourth,
physicians should focus on the &ldquo;history&rdquo; and observation
of diseases, &ldquo;their begining progresse &amp; ways of
cure&rdquo;. Locke here expands on Sydenham&rsquo;s precepts to more
rigorously explain and defend them, and in doing so, moves away from
his earlier approach to medicine. (In contrast, Anstey 2011a and 2011b
supposes that Locke remained a &ldquo;chymical&rdquo; physician for
the entirety of his career, but also promoted Sydenham as a proxy for
Locke&rsquo;s own innovations in medicine. This is debated in Walmsley
2012, Anstey 2015, and Walmsley 2016.)</p>

<h2 id="LockMethEssaConcHumaUnde">6. Locke&rsquo;s Methodology in the <em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em></h2>

<p>
Locke began to write the <em>Essay</em> in the summer of 1671, no more
than a few weeks after Sydenham wrote &ldquo;Epidemicall diseases of
the year 1670&rdquo; in his &ldquo;Medical Observations&rdquo;, which
Locke later made his own manuscript copy of. The first still extant
draft of the <em>Essay</em>, now known as Draft A, shared the same
basic philosophical outlook as Locke evinced in &ldquo;Anatomia&rdquo;
and &ldquo;De Arte Medica&rdquo;, namely (1) we have no knowledge of
nature&rsquo;s unobservable causes, (2) we cannot therefore resolve
disputes about such causes and consequently (3) we should rely solely
upon experience as the foundation of natural philosophical
knowledge.</p>

<p>
Locke begins his account in robustly empiricist fashion &ldquo;I
imagin that all knowledg is founded on and ultimately derives it self
from sense&rdquo; (Draft A, &sect;1, 1), noting that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the clearest best &amp; most certain knowledg that man kinde can
possibly have of things existing without him is but Experience, which
is noe thing but the Exercise &amp; observation of his senses about
particular objects. (Draft A, &sect;33, 62&ndash;63)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But he re-iterated the strict limits he set in &ldquo;Anatomia&rdquo;
regarding the reach of the senses. Knowledge of cause and effect
pertained only to the observable level:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I can have noe other certein undoubted knowledg of the constant
connection of assigned causes &amp; effects then what I have by my
senses. which too is but a grosse kinde of knowledg is noe more then
this, that I see when I apply fire to gold it melts it. (Draft A,
&sect;15, 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We have this &ldquo;grosse kind of knowledg&rdquo; because we have
&ldquo;noe knowledg of the modus operandi, the way how these effects
are produced&rdquo; (Draft A, &sect;15, 31). Our senses have a limited
ability to provide such knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
because these alterations being made by particles soe small &amp;
minute that they come not within the observation of my senses I cannot
get knowledg how they operate, but only am informd by my senses that
the alterations are indeed made from whence by the by we may take a
litle light how much in the information of our understandings we are
beholding to our senses. (Draft A, &sect;15, 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This meant that we had no way of determining which of several
theoretical descriptions were correct. Propositions</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
which being concerning matters out of the reach of our senses are
capable neither of Observation nor consequently Testimony</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
were of two sorts: firstly concerning the spiritual world and
secondly,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Concerning the existence, modifications &amp; manner of operation of
insensible materiall things. (Draft A, &sect;38, 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke gave examples of what he had in mind:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Natural spirits in animals. The forme soule or Effluviums of a load
stone whereby it draws iron. (Draft A, &sect;38, 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Natural spirits were the Galenic explanation of how creatures were
nourished and grew and &ldquo;formes&rdquo; were Aristotelean. The
reference to the &ldquo;soule&rdquo; of a lodestone likely refers to
Gilbert&rsquo;s <em>De Magnete</em>. The reference to
&ldquo;Effluviums&rdquo; may hint at mechanical explanations often
employed by Boyle. These possible explanations were used
indifferently. Being &ldquo;out of the reach of our senses&rdquo; they
were &ldquo;capable neither of Observation nor consequently
Testimony&rdquo;. Locke alluded to mechanical explanations in Draft A,
but only to illustrate our lack of knowledge of causes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For had we but senses that could discover to us the particles of water
their figure site motion &amp;c when it is fluid. And also the
different postures of those very particles, or the addition or
seperation of some particles &amp;c when the water was frozen i.e
hardend, we should as well know the very modus or way whereby cold
produces hardness &amp; consistency in water, as we doe the way how a
joyner puts several peices of wood togeather to make a box or table
which by tenants nails &amp; pins we well enough perceive how it hangs
togeather. And the motions of an animal would be as intelligible to us
as those of a watch. (Draft A, &sect;15, 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet he then continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But our senses faileing us in the discovery of those fine &amp;
insensible particles our understandings are unavoidably in the darke.
(Draft A, &sect;15, 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At this point in the development of his philosophical career, Locke
did not endorse the mechanical philosophy, as he was committed to the
more fundamental view that knowledge is bounded by sensation and human
senses are unable to penetrate into the operations of nature.
Mechanism was thus as much an unknowable explanation as Aristotelian
&ldquo;formes&rdquo; or magnetic &ldquo;soules&rdquo;. These were
views that Locke developed and elaborated over the several previous
years in close collaboration with Sydenham. There was thus no
endorsement of the corpuscular philosophy, and no argument for a
distinction between primary and secondary qualities.</p>

<p>
Another manuscript draft of the <em>Essay</em>, now referred to as
Draft B, written shortly after Draft A, reiterated the same basic
philosophical precepts. Locke remained committed to the view that
human capability placed strict limits on what we could know since we
have</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
but some few superficial Ideas of things discoverd to us only by
Sensation or Reflection. we have noe knowledg beyond that much lesse
of the essence of things being destitute of facultys to atteine it.
(Draft B, &sect;94, 211)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consequently,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
when soever we would proceed beyond those simple Ideas we have from
Sensation &amp; reflection (which we can in our whole extent of
knowledg &amp; imagination only extend enlarge repeat &amp; joyn
togeather) &amp; peirce farther into the nature of things we fall
presently into darknesse &amp; obscurity. perplexedness &amp;
difficultys &amp; can discover noe thing farther but our owne
shortsightednesse &amp; ignorance. (Draft B, &sect;94,
211&ndash;12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But in this draft Locke developed a significant iteration in his views
about unobservable phenomena. Locke based his discussion of natural
causation in Draft B largely upon the work produced in Draft A and
most of the text on this subject in sections 137 and 139 were copied
from the previous text. Section 138, however, was entirely new to
Draft B. This section, entitled &ldquo;The efficacy of causes can be
imagind to be noething but motion&rdquo;, advanced a new
consideration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
though in the effects we dayly see produced in the world we perceive
or know very little of the ways whereby their causes operate yet I
thinke I may venture to say we can hardly conceive their efficacy to
consist in any thing but motion. (Draft B, &sect;138, 256)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was a sweeping assertion: Locke was saying that all natural
events could only be conceived of as effects of the motion of bodies.
Locke went on to explain his reasoning in section 150, during a
discussion of the &ldquo;power&rdquo; of one thing to effect
another:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
efficacy or action how ever various &amp; the effects almost infinite
we can I thinke conceive in Intellectuall agents to be noething else
but modes of thinkeing in Corporeall noething else but modifications
of motion, I say I thinke we cannot conceive to be any other but these
two for what ever sort of action besides these produces any effect I
confesse my self to have noe notion nor Idea of &amp; soe are as far
from my thoughts apprehension &amp; knowledge &amp; as much in the
darke to me as the Ideas of colours to a blinde man or the
apprehension of ten senses are to me. (Draft B, &sect;150, 262)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke asserted that he had an <em>idea</em> of corporeal efficacy in
the case of moving and impacting bodies&mdash;he could see how motion
and impact caused change in the natural work. Moreover, he asserted
that that this was the <em>only</em> idea he had of how natural causes
work. This would then mark a significant contrast between an
Aristotelean
&ldquo;&delta;&eta;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&gamma;&#8056;&sigmaf;&rdquo;,
or an Helmontian &ldquo;Archeus&rdquo;, and a mechanical explanation.
In the case of the former two, we &ldquo;reach beyond the
senses&rdquo; to posit these entities of which we have no ideas
grounded in sensation, where in the latter, we refer to processes we
have actual experience of. So while Locke continued to maintain that
our senses would never allow us to penetrate into nature&rsquo;s
operations, we can now &ldquo;intelligibly&rdquo; describe them in
mechanical terms, since we have ideas of mechanical interactions. This
line of argument, that mechanical explanations were more intelligible
than their contemporary counterparts, was one that Boyle had and would
advance in a number of publications (see Anstey 2019), and one that
Locke now began to evince.</p>

<p>
For Locke, then it appears that to meaningfully talk and think about
processes at the unobservable level, we can only employ ideas from
everyday experience. Thus, in so far as the mechanical hypothesis was
the only theory that relied upon the central idea of the motion and
impact of bodies, and given Locke&rsquo;s stated belief that motion
was the only idea by which we can conceive/imagine corporeal
causation, mechanism was the only conceivable theory available to us.
For Locke, it was the only conceivable theory, full stop. This then,
was the fundamental basis for Locke&rsquo;s limited endorsement of the
mechanical philosophy&mdash;it was an &ldquo;intelligible&rdquo;,
meaningful description of the unobservable realm, where other theories
relied upon explanations with no tangible grounding in experience.</p>

<p>
Locke would reiterate the same basic principles in the published
<em>Essay</em>. As he had suggested in &ldquo;De Arte Medica&rdquo;,
we can&rsquo;t know how bodies work, because God&rsquo;s creation was
beyond our comprehension:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is not so contemptible a Plant or Animal, that does not confound
the most inlarged Understanding. Though the familiar use of Things
about us, take off our Wonder; yet it cures not our Ignorance. When we
come to examine the Stones, we tread on; or the Iron, we daily handle,
we presently find, we know not their Make; and can give no reason, of
the different Qualities we find in them, &rsquo;Tis evident the
internal constitution whereon the Properties depend, is unknown to us
&hellip; The Workmanship of the All-wise, and Powerful God, in the
great Fabrick of the Universe, and every part thereof, further exceeds
the Capacity and Comprehension of the most inquisitive and intelligent
Man. (Locke 1690: III.vi.9 [1975: 444])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consequently, the only way to understand the world was to undertake
the same sort of careful and diligent observation of the world that a
doctor would undertake of a patient&mdash;that is, through natural
history:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the Knowledge of Bodies, we must be content to glean, what we can,
from particular Experiments: since we cannot from a Discovery of their
real Essences, grasp at a time whole Sheaves; and in bundles
comprehend the Nature and Properties of whole Species together. Where
our Enquiry is concerning Co-existence, or Repugnancy to co-exist,
which by Contemplation of our Ideas, we cannot discover; there
Experience, Observation, and natural History, must give us by our
Senses, and by retail, an insight into corporeal Substances. (Locke
1690: IV.xii.12 [1975: 647])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, Locke&rsquo;s recommendation of the mechanism was couched
in terms of its intelligibility in describing the unobservable world,
given our limited faculties:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I have here instanced in the corpuscularian Hypothesis, as that which
is thought to go farthest in an intelligible Explication of the
Qualities of Bodies; and I fear the Weakness of humane Understanding
is scarce able to substitute another, which will afford us a fuller
and clearer discovery of the necessary Connexion, and
<em>Co-existence</em>, of the Powers, which are to be observed united
in several sorts of them. (Locke 1690: IV.iii.16 [1975:
547&ndash;8])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But because this recommendation was based on what we can apprehend,
Locke considered it perfectly possible that there are other modes of
natural operation, but these are likely inconceivable to us and we are
unlikley to ever understand how nature operates. Locke went on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This at least is certain, that, whichever Hypothesis be clearest and
truest, (for of that it is not my business to determine,) our
Knowledge concerning corporeal Substances will be very little advanced
by any of them, till we are made to see what Qualities and Powers of
Bodies have a <em>necessary Connexion or Repugnancy</em> one with
another; which in the present State of Philosophy I think we know but
to a very small degree: and I doubt whether, with those Faculties we
have, we shall ever be able to carry our general Knowledge (I say not
particular Experience) in this part much further. Experience is that
which in this part we must depend on. (Locke 1690: IV.iii.16 [1975:
548])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given the limited state of our faculties, experience is what we must
more generally rely upon. Locke&rsquo;s endorsement of the
corpuscularian philosophy was a function of our cognitive and sensory
faculties. Locke was well aware that there were numerous difficulties
that the corpuscularian theory could not well account for&mdash;the
cohesion of matter, or the relation of idea of secondary qualities to
their primary quality causes, for example. But these were just
examples of the wider weakness of human understanding and the limited
recommendation he could make of any natural philosophical theory about
unobservable phenonema.</p>

<h2 id="LockHypo">7. Locke on Hypotheses</h2>

<p>
In &ldquo;De Arte Medica&rdquo; Locke noted a natural predeliction to
formulate hypotheses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
mans understanding, which not contenting its self to observe the
operation of nature &amp; the event of things, is very inquisitive
after their cause &amp; very restlesse &amp; unquiet till in those
things wch it is conversant about, it has framed to its self some
hypothesis &amp; laid a foundation whereon to establish all its
reasonings. (Locke 1669 [2014: fo. 50r])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These motivations might provide an explanation for the creation of
hypotheses, but it would not make them any more useful:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
supposeing v.g. that too much acidity in the bloud or other juices
caused the gout a fever or epilepsie what indication would this give a
practicall physitian in the cure of either of these diseases tis true
twill presently be suggested he must mortifie this acidity &hellip; he
that shall proceed in such grounds as these may indeed constitute fine
doctrines &amp; lay plausible hypotheses but will not have much to
brag of his cures. for the alterations that both our food &amp;
physick receives in our mouths stomachs guts glandules &amp;c are soe
many &amp; soe unintelligible to us before they come to the places we
designe them, that they are quite another thing then we imagine &amp;
worke not as we phansie but as nature pleases. (Locke 1669 [2014: fo.
37v])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s wariness of hypotheses extended into the published
<em>Essay</em>. Book IV, Chapter 12, Section 12 was titled &ldquo;In
the study of nature we must beware of hypotheses and wrong
principles&rdquo;, and lamented:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
He that shall consider, <em>how little general Maxims, precarious
Principles, and Hypotheses laid down at Pleasure, have promoted true
Knowledge</em>, or helped to satisfy the Enquiries of rational Men
after real Improvements; How little, I say, the setting out at that
end, has for many Ages together advanced Men&rsquo;s Progress, towards
the Knowledge of natural Philosophy, will think, we have Reason to
thank those, who in this latter Age have taken another Course, and
have trod out to us, though not an easier way to learned Ignorance,
yet a surer way to profitable Knowledge. (Locke 1690: IV.xii.12 [1975:
647])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was hardly a ringing endorsement of hypotheses as a means to
knowledge, though the next section on &ldquo;The true use of
hypotheses&rdquo; did concede that they could be useful despite our
general ignorance about nature&rsquo;s modes of operation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Hypotheses</em>, if they are well made, are at least great helps
to the Memory, and often direct us to new discoveries. But my Meaning
is, that we should <em>not take up any one too hastily</em>, (which
the Mind, that would always penetrate into the Causes of Things, and
have Principles to rest on, is very apt to do,) till we have very well
examined Particulars, and made several Experiments, in that thing
which we would explain by our Hypothesis, and see whether it will
agree to them all. (Locke 1690: IV.xii.13 [1975: 648])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is notable that Locke&rsquo;s diagnosis of the human predeliction
to formulate hypotheses is identical to that he had advanced decades
earlier in &ldquo;De Arte Medica&rdquo; when working with
Sydenham.</p>

<p>
Locke did note that analogy could be helpful in formulating helpful
hypotheses, titling Book IV, Chapter xvi, Section 12 &ldquo;In things
which sense cannot discover, analogy is the great rule of
probability&rdquo;, concluding that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This sort of Probability, which is the best conduct of rational
Experiments, and the rise of Hypothesis, has also its Use and
Influence; and a wary Reasoning from Analogy leads us often into the
discovery of Truths, and useful Productions, which would otherwise lie
concealed. (Locke 1690: IV.xvi.12 [1975: 666&ndash;7])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hypothesis, then, can play a role for Locke, despite our natural
inclination to jump to conclusions and place too much emphasis on our
own suppositions. But Locke was always clear that analogy and
hypothesis were supposition, and while they might produce helpful
outcomes, they might equally lead to error. In one of the last
sections of the &ldquo;Conduct of the Understanding&rdquo; written
between 1690 and 1704, Locke noted that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Analogy is of great use to the Mind in many Cases, especially in
natural Philosophy, and that part of it chiefly which consists in
happy and successful Experiments. But here we must take care that we
keep ourselves within that wherein the Analogy consists. For Example,
the acid Oyl of <em>Vitriol</em> is found to be good in such as case,
therefore the Spirit of <em>Niter</em> or <em>Vinegar</em> may be
us&rsquo;d in the like case. If the good Effect of it be owing wholly
to the Acidity of it, the trial may be justified; but if there be
something else besides the Acidity in the Oil of <em>Vitriol</em>,
which produces the good we desire in the case, we mistake that for
Analogy, which is not, and suffer our Understanding to be misguided by
a wrong supposition of Analogy where there is none. (Locke
1690&ndash;1704: 115)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These were the same sorts of considerations that informed
Locke&rsquo;s wariness about hypotheses in &ldquo;De Arte
Medica&rdquo;. We simply can&rsquo;t be sure about what&rsquo;s going
on at the unobservable level, so while we can formulate hypotheses,
and would be wise to use analogy to do so, nature&rsquo;s impenetrable
operations might frustrate us still. That a hypothesis discovers some
new truth does not seem to confer any special status for
Locke&mdash;hypotheses work in some cases, but don&rsquo;t in others,
and there is little sense in Locke&rsquo;s remarks that any success
might confer some additional insight into the unobservable operations
of nature, or that these operations are discernible through this
success. This serves to illustrate the essentially pre-Newtonian cast
of the <em>Essay</em>, begun in 1671, and in large part completed
before the <em>Principia</em> was published in 1687. Placing
Locke&rsquo;s remarks within the context of his medical work
illuminates Locke&rsquo;s motivations and meaning in his writings on
natural philosophy and his approach to the philosophy of science in
the <em>Essay</em>.</p>

<h2 id="LockHumaUnde">8. Locke on Human Understanding</h2>

<p>
More generally, Locke&rsquo;s entire method in his study of human
understanding was framed by the same basic precepts that underpinned
his medical thinking. When describing how he would undertake his
enquiry into the &ldquo;original, certainty, and extent of human
knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion,
and assent&rdquo;, he first stated what he would refrain from
attempting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I shall not at present meddle with the Physical Consideration of the
Mind; or trouble myself to examine wherein its Essence consists; or by
what Motions of our Spirits, or Alterations of our Bodies, we come to
have any Sensation by our Organs, or any <em>Ideas</em> in our
Understandings; and whether those <em>Ideas</em> do in their
Formation, any, or all of them, depend on Matter, or no. These are
Speculations, which, however curious and entertaining, I shall
decline, as lying out of my Way, in the Design I am now upon. (Locke
1690: I.i.2 [1975: 43])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead, Locke would confine himself to observing and cataloguing the
faculties of the understanding to understand their capability and
reach:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It shall suffice to my present Purpose, to consider the discerning
Faculties of a Man, as they are employ&rsquo;d about the Objects,
which they have to do with: and I shall imagine I have not wholly
misimploy&rsquo;d myself in the Thoughts I shall have on this
Occasion, if, in this Historical, plain Method, I can give any Account
of the Ways, whereby our Understandings come to attain those Notions
of Things we have. (Locke 1690: I.i.2 [1975: 44])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s method in philosophy was to pursue a natural history of
the understanding without speculation about its unobservable
structure, much as Sydenham&rsquo;s method in medicine was a natural
history of disease with a similar disregard for speculation about
aetiology. Locke began his natural history of the understanding in
1671 after having worked side-by-side with Sydenham for the 4 years
immediately prior. Locke&rsquo;s key assumptions about the
world&mdash;that God made it essentially unknowable, and that natural
history is the only reliable method to useful knowledge&mdash;were
derived directly from his work with Sydenham. Locke&rsquo;s
philosophical work was, in key respects, the application of
Sydenham&rsquo;s medical methodology writ large.</p>
