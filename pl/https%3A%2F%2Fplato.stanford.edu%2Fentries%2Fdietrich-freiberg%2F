<h1>Dietrich of Freiberg</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Feb 23, 2005; substantive revision Tue Oct 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The philosopher and theologian Dietrich of Freiberg (c.
1250&ndash;1310) was one of the most original thinkers of his time. He
belonged to what has been sometimes called the Cologne School or the
German Dominican School, alongside figures such as Ulrich of
Strasbourg (c. 1225&ndash;1277), Master Eckhart (c. 1260&ndash;1327),
and Berthold of Moosburg (d. c. 1361)&mdash;a group particularly
marked by the influence of Albert the Great (c. 1193&ndash;1280). Like
these authors, Dietrich developed a doctrine shaped by a form of
Neoplatonism and synthesized a wide range of sources, notably various
Neoplatonic authors and Averroes. Rediscovered in the twentieth
century, Dietrich gained fame for having argued that the categorial
structure of things is produced by the intellect, a view that led some
to regard him as a kind of &lsquo;medieval Kant&rsquo; (Flasch 1972).
Although this label has been challenged, it is also recognized that
the significance of his work extends far beyond this striking thesis,
which is embedded in a complex emanationist metaphysics. Moreover,
Dietrich is considered the first scholar to have offered a correct
explanation of the rainbow. Dietrich&rsquo;s work thus spans a very
broad range of interests, from metaphysics to concrete questions in
natural philosophy concerning light and color, as well as theology and
psychology. Across all these domains, his thought exhibits great
originality and remarkable systematicity.</p>

<h2 id="LifDieFre">1. Life of Dietrich of Freiberg</h2>

<p>
Little is known with certainty about the life of Dietrich of Freiberg.
He was born in Freiberg in Saxony around the year 1250. He is
sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Dietrich of Saxony,&rdquo; and often
as &ldquo;Theodoricus Teutonicus.&rdquo; He is also mentioned in
medieval documents as &ldquo;Magister&rdquo; or &ldquo;Master,&rdquo;
indicating that he had advanced university training. He joined the
Dominican order at a young age. We know that he was still a youth when
Albertus Magnus was coming to the end of his career. But it is not
known whether Dietrich studied under Albert or ever met him. Around
the year 1271 he served as lector in the Dominican convent at Freiberg
in Saxony. That he studied at Paris is clear, that it was sometime
during the period between 1272&ndash;1274 is probable. But it is not
known with whom he studied. There is evidence provided by
Dietrich&rsquo;s own hand, found in chapter thirty of the second part
of his <em>Tractatus de intellectu et intelligibili</em> and in other
places in his works that suggests he may have studied under Henry of
Ghent. Dietrich mentions a certain &ldquo;solemn master&rdquo; whom he
heard dispute in Paris. Henry was known to his students as
&ldquo;doctor solemnis&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;magister
solemnis&rdquo; as well. An examination of Dietrich&rsquo;s writings
suggests some themes that could possibly owe their origins to Henry of
Ghent (Porro 2009, 2013; Decaix 2021).</p>

<p>
Dietrich returned to Germany in 1280 and held the post of lector in
the city of Trier until 1281. He returned to Paris in 1281 in order to
hold lectures on the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard, perhaps at
Saint-Jacques. He may have remained in Paris until 1293. Although the
documents are not clear, most historians agree that he was appointed
prior of the Dominican convent in W&uuml;rzburg. In 1293, he was named
Provincial Superior of his order for the province of Germany, Albert
the Great&rsquo;s old post. Between 1296 and 1297, he was
&ldquo;Master of Theology&rdquo; at the University of Paris. He
continued to teach in Paris until 1300. In 1304, he was present at the
general chapter of the Dominican order held at Toulouse. His name last
appears in the acts of the general chapter of the order held in
Piacenza in 1310. There he was appointed Vicar Provincial of Germany.
After this time his name drops out of the documents (Eckert 1957/1959;
Sturlese 1984; Kandler 2009).</p>

<h2 id="PhiWor">2. Philosophical Works</h2>

<p>
Dietrich was a prolific writer. His writings include compositions on
nearly every branch of theology, philosophy, and natural science known
to his period. His philosophical and scientific works far outnumber
his strictly theological treatises. His <em>Opera omnia</em>,
published in the <em>Corpus Philosophorum Teutonicorum Medii
Aevi</em>, occupy four volumes.</p>

<p>
Among his theological writings are included his treatises on the
beatific vision (<em>De visione beatifica</em>), on the nature of
Christ&rsquo;s body after the crucifixion (<em>De corpore Christi
mortuo</em>), on the nature of glorified bodies (<em>De dotibus
corporum gloriosorum),</em> on spiritual substances and the
resurrection (<em>De substantiis spiritualibus et corporibus futurae
resurrectionis</em>).</p>

<p>
His philosophical writings&mdash;some of which may be also classified
as scientific works&mdash;include: <em>De habitibus</em>, <em>De ente
et essentia</em>, <em>De magis et minus</em>, <em>De natura
contrariorum</em>, <em>De cognitione entium separatorum et maxime
animarum separatarum</em>, <em>De intelligentiis et motoribus
caelorum</em>, <em>De corporibus caelestibus quoad naturam eorum
corporalem</em>, <em>De animatione caeli</em>, <em>De
accidentibus</em>, <em>De quiditatibus entium</em>, <em>De origine
rerum praedicamentalium</em>, <em>De mensuris</em>, <em>De natura et
proprietate continuorum</em>, and the <em>De intellectu et
intelligibili</em>.</p>

<p>
It is also as a scientist&mdash;or, in the terms of the time, as a
natural philosopher&mdash;that Dietrich distinguished himself. Some of
his scientific treatises, which have long attracted the attention of
historians of science, are famous. His treatises on light (<em>De
luce</em>), on color (<em>De coloribus</em>), and on the rainbow
(<em>De iride</em>), composed in the scientific spirit of Albert the
Great, contributed greatly to the development of optics.</p>

<h2 id="Noe">3. Noetics</h2>

<p>
Dietrich of Freiberg&rsquo;s distinctive noetics&mdash;including his
original theory of the intellect&rsquo;s constitutive activity and his
particular conception of the role of the soul&rsquo;s faculties in the
process of knowledge&mdash;has drawn the primary attention of
historians of philosophy. Given that it indeed represents one of the
most original components of his thought, and more importantly, that it
serves as a central key to understanding the broader system of which
it is an inseparable part, it is appropriate to begin by presenting
it.</p>

<h3 id="ConPowMin">3.1 The constitutive power of the mind</h3>

<p>
Alternately compared to Kant&rsquo;s transcendental idealism (Flasch
1972; Mojsisch 1977) or to the subjectivity in the modern
<em>cogito</em> (Berland 2007), Dietrich of Freiberg&rsquo;s noetics
is highly innovative. Dietrich grants the intellect a constitutive
power. This constitutive power is exercised over things of first
intention (<em>res primae intentionis</em>) that have an extramental
existence. In <em>De origine rerum praedicamentalium</em>
(<em>DORP</em>), Dietrich systematizes the categories according to
their origin, i.e., their principles and causes. According to him, the
first three categories (substance, quantity, quality) have nature as
their cause. However, the following seven categories are not directed
by nature to a certain end, and thus are not the principle of a
real&mdash;i.e., natural&mdash;operation. They must therefore be
traced back to another kind of cause and principle,&nbsp;and since
there are only two principles of being, namely nature and intellect,
it can&nbsp;which can only be the intellect. The intellect thus plays
a constitutive role with respect to relative categories. If this
bipartition of categories into three on the one hand, and seven on the
other, is similar to what we find in Henry of Ghent
(<em>Quodlibet</em>, VII, 2), the major difference is that Dietrich
considers the seven remaining categories constituted by the intellect
to be just as &ldquo;real&rdquo; as the first three. Consequently, the
intellect does indeed possess a constitutive power with regard to
reality.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the human intellect not only constitutes the seven
relative categories, but also what Dietrich calls quidditative being
(<em>esse quiditativum</em>). The fifth chapter of <em>De origine
rerum praedicamentalium</em> demonstrates this original
thesis.&nbsp;For Dietrich, the intellect is never passive: it is a
&ldquo;simple form&rdquo;. It cannot be moved by sensible corporeal
objects, because these are inferior in nobility, following Augustine,
and because of its own separation, following Averroes.
Consequently,&nbsp;intellection does not proceed from the reception of
an&nbsp;intelligible form transmitted by the internal senses to the
intellect. The intellect is active and initiates its relation to its
object. In this sense, the intellect is indeed the cause of its proper
object: it constitutes it in its <em>ratio</em>&nbsp;of being an
object, i.e., in its intelligibility. This audacious thesis opens up
an interpretation of his noetics in terms of
&ldquo;intentionality&rdquo; (<em>DORP</em>, 5 (26), 186&ndash;7; see
Perler 2003; Decaix 2021).</p>

<p>
His theory of the internal senses, summarized in the <em>Quaestio
utrum in deo sit aliqua vis inferior intellectu,</em> is equally
interesting. Notably, he makes original use of the cogitative faculty,
inherited from Averroes, capable of producing, through its abstractive
power, the universal intention of the thing, naked and stripped of all
accidental marks (<em>DORP</em>, 5 (28); see Colli 2008; De Libera
2009).</p>

<h3 id="EnsCon">3.2 <em>Ens conceptionale</em></h3>

<p>
For Dietrich, noetics is inherently linked to metaphysics. In his
emanationist universe, each kind of being is assigned a distinct mode
of knowledge according to its place and order in the universe (see
Section 5.3 below). This particular connection between metaphysics and
noetics is coined in the concept of <em>ens conceptionale</em>
(Mojsisch 1984): each kind of being (<em>manieres entium</em>)
possesses a distinct mode of knowing, and their being is none other
than a mode of cognizing. In <em>De visione beatifica</em>, Dietrich
states that the distinction between conceptional and real being is the
very first division of being, thereby replacing the Thomist division
between <em>ens reale</em> and <em>ens rationis.</em></p>

<p>
Conceptional being (<em>ens conceptionale</em>) is really coextensive
with what Dietrich calls the university of beings (<em>universitas
entium</em>) because the former exemplifies in itself all the modes of
natural being. Furthermore, conceptional being includes for Dietrich
not just the objects of the intellectual act but the act itself. So,
in its similitude to divine creation, the intellect possesses an
emanative activity which Dietrich calls <em>emanatio simplex</em>, by
analogy with the creative emanation of God. Of course, the
intellective act is also reproductive, it does establish a mirror of
external reality (the meaning of <em>ens reale</em> for Dietrich).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, <em>ens conceptionale</em> forms a conceptional hierarchy
of its own, complementary to the general hierarchy of being described
below (Section 5.3). At the bottom of this conceptional order are the
external senses, followed by the interior senses, the <em>vis
cogitativa</em>, the possible intellect, and finally the agent
intellect at the very top. Due to its superiority, the intellect is
resplendent with the universe of beings. &ldquo;All beings shine forth
(<em>resplendent</em>) in its essence&rdquo; (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.4 (4),
29), according to Dietrich. In the realm of intellects, Dietrich tells
us, there is a fourfold order in which intellectual reality stands: at
the top of this order are intellects existing through their essence,
followed by intelligent spiritual substances that are called angels,
then species, and finally the individual realities included in species
that are known to mind. Further subdividing this hierarchy of
conceptual being, Dietrich specifies that there are three kinds of
intellects that exist through their essence: the separate
intelligences, the intellects united to celestial bodies, and human
intellects.</p>

<p>
The various modes of being within the entire hierarchy of being as
well as the different kinds of beings subordinate to the first being
(see Section 5.3 below) all bear a likeness to God. Dietrich
innovatively describes the properties of the agent intellect
(<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.6), emphasizing its substantiality. First
(<em>DVB</em>, 1.1), the agent intellect is substance, because it is
the image of God (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.1, 15&ndash;6), and it always
cognizes in act (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.2, 22&ndash;5), thus it always
cognizes itself in its essence (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.3, 26&ndash;8).
Moreover, insofar as it is an exemplar and likeness of the totality of
being (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.4, 28&ndash;30), in cognizing itself, the
agent intellect cognizes all other things (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.5, 30).
The substantiality of the agent intellect is demonstrated through a
dynamic approach, inherited from Augustine: (1) substance is that
which exceeds its subject (<em>DVB</em>, 1.1.7, 31&ndash;3), that
which cannot pertain to accidents. (2) The agent intellect, as an
image of God (<em>imago dei</em>), encompasses a substantial likeness,
or an essential conformity to God (<em>DVB</em>, 1.2, 36&ndash;53),
which is why (3), it is capable of God (<em>capax dei</em>, cf.
<em>DVB</em>, 1.4, 61), and (4) essentially converted into God
(<em>DVB</em>, 1.5, 62&ndash;3). The agent intellect gives rise to an
order of emanation that is just as vast as that of the creative
emanation of God in the order of real beings. In fact, it mirrors this
order perfectly: it is itself identified with the universe of beings
(<em>exemplar et similitudo totius entis</em>). By its intimate,
essential and immediate self-knowledge, Dietrich&rsquo;s conception of
the agent intellect has been compared to a philosophy of the self. The
possible intellect, on the contrary, needs to be actualized: it is by
knowing other things that it comes to understand itself.</p>

<p>
But the various members of Dietrich&rsquo;s hierarchy of being are
also bound together into a universe of beings by the similitude they
bear to each other. This similitude, however, is the result of the
essential order of causation, according to which every being in the
universe of beings is ordered to every other being either as cause or
effect. Thus, the totality of beings are bound together making up a
universe where every creature bears a relation of similitude to every
other creature and to the primary unifying principle from which they
emanate, i.e., God. The intellect is a universal nature, in accord
with its intellectual essence, which is not determined to understand
only this or that thing. This is clear from its object, which is not
this or that quiddity, but universally any quiddity and being as
being, that is, whatever possesses the character of being.</p>

<h3 id="IntIndSou">3.3 Intellect and the individual soul</h3>

<p>
Dietrich&rsquo;s account of intellection raises another question,
namely: what kind of causal relationship exists between the agent
intellect and the human soul? Dietrich gives a very precise answer to
this question, no doubt based on his acceptance of Proclus&rsquo;
exposition of the principles of generation within the hierarchy of
being. The agent intellect, according to Dietrich&rsquo;s solution, is
the intrinsic essential principle of the intellectual soul. That it
cannot be the material cause is self-evident. It cannot be the final
cause since a final cause perfects a thing, but does not establish it
in being, which is what the agent intellect does for the soul.</p>

<p>
The importance of Averroes in his philosophy (Flasch 2007; Calma 2009)
should not be interpreted as including Dietrich among the &ldquo;Latin
Averroists.&rdquo; Indeed, in his <em>De intellectu et
intelligibili</em>, he argues, against Averroes, that the agent and
possible intellects are individuated and numbered by the individual
souls.&nbsp;Dietrich, however, basing his position squarely upon an
old Augustinian tradition, argues that separation is a characteristic
of intellect as such, and in a human soul it is present in the form of
an <em>intraneitas</em>, that is to say, the &ldquo;interiority&rdquo;
which Augustine claimed was not joined to the body as its form.</p>

<p>
His notion of individuality is also original: dismissing the Thomistic
model of individuation through quantified matter, Dietrich holds that
quantified matter does not represent a universal principle of
individuation, insofar as spiritual substances&mdash;such as
angels&mdash;do not possess matter. Nonetheless, in most
individualized beings there exists a form of composition consisting in
what Dietrich calls &ldquo;parts posterior to the whole&rdquo; (see,
e.g., <em>DLEO</em>, 10 (3), 17), which are parts that do not modify
the essential nature of a being (unlike the &ldquo;parts prior to the
whole&rdquo; represented by genus and species in an essential
definition). For corporeal substances (including celestial bodies),
these parts posterior to the whole are quantitative, and individuation
indeed occurs by means of the dimensions of matter (<em>DCC</em>, 7
(3), 383): Dietrich maintains that prime matter possesses
indeterminate dimensions, which receive their full determination only
through a substantial form (<em>DCC</em>, 4, 382). In the case of
angels, however, these individuating parts are qualitative and involve
a form of composition among different faculties&mdash;notably, between
active and passive powers (<em>DII</em>, II.26 (3), 165). Beings that
do not even possess &ldquo;parts posterior to the whole,&rdquo; such
as agent intellects, are individuated by real relations existing in
the natural order (<em>respectus reales naturales</em>) between the
different beings, like being equal, similar, or different
(<em>DII</em>, II.27 (3), 166). This view of individuality encompasses
thus immaterial beings such as angels, separate substances, simple
intelligences, and the intellect (Su&aacute;rez-Nani 1998).</p>

<p>
The idea that the intellect is both what is most intimate to the
individual and, in a certain sense, separate from them, has important
consequences. The agent intellect cannot be the formal cause of the
soul&mdash;at least not in the natural order of things. Dietrich
argues that if it were the formal cause of the soul&mdash;given that
the soul, by definition, is the formal cause of the human
person&mdash;then it would follow that there would be a form of a form
in the same species (human). But this is contrary to the natural order
of things because whatever is the form of something in the genus of
substance is by the whole of itself the act of its subject. Thus, the
same thing cannot be in potency to more than one form in its genus. A
human being is therefore not fully joined to his intellect, an
intellect that is always in act and resplendent with the universe of
beings. Such a vision, as we will shortly see, is expanded in <em>De
visione beatifica</em>.</p>

<h2 id="The">4. Theology</h2>

<p>
Unlike his famous predecessor Thomas Aquinas, the Saxon Master&rsquo;s
theological works have not been transmitted to posterity in their
totality. Even if his sermons have been lost, and might have earned
Dietrich the same fame as his no-less famous successor Master Eckhart,
we do know that he held an impactful vernacular preaching. As a
result, Dietrich has often been considered part of the Rhenish
mysticism alongside with Albert the Great and Master Eckhart (cf.
Sturlese 1977; De Libera 1990). The question <em>De subiecto
theologiae</em> seems to be the only remnant of his <em>Commentary on
the Sentences</em>.</p>

<p>
A word of caution is necessary here: distinguishing what properly
belongs to theology in Dietrich&rsquo;s thought&mdash;as opposed to
his noetics, metaphysics, or even cosmology&mdash;can at times prove
difficult, due to the intimate connection he establishes between these
domains, and the strictly philosophical stance he often adopts on
theological questions. His <em>De visione beatifica</em>, for example,
has been read and interpreted primarily for the theory of knowledge it
develops. Throughout his work, Dietrich of Freiberg adopts the
position of a consistent metaphysician who refuses to allow any
compromise between philosophy and the dogmas of sacred faith. Such
attempts lead both to intolerable error in the eyes of philosophy, and
to serious damage to True Doctrine. In these treatises (<em>DVB,</em>
<em>DA</em>, <em>DQE</em>, <em>DEE</em>), Dietrich of Freiberg&rsquo;s
antithomism is very prominent, playing Averroes off against Thomas
Aquinas, in favor of a coherent Aristotelianism. It is nevertheless
clear that, given his institutional position and the breadth of the
writings he left us, a portion of Dietrich&rsquo;s work concerns
theological themes. The present section successively presents his
theory of the beatific vision and his positions on major theological
controversies of his time.</p>

<h3 id="BeaVis">4.1 On the beatific vision</h3>

<p>
In <em>De visione beatifica</em>, Dietrich of Freiberg promotes an
intellectualist model of the beatific vision. He argues that the
beatific vision is immediate and direct. It is a vision of God&rsquo;s
essence that requires no intermediary (i.e., no &ldquo;species&rdquo;
according to the terminology of the time). Therefore, beatific vision
occurs through the agent intellect, and not the possible intellect,
which cannot think without images. Dietrich&rsquo;s treatise is
polemical against the <em>communiter loquentes</em> of the
&ldquo;common doctrine,&rdquo; according to which the beatific vision
is produced through the light of glory (<em>lumen
gloriae</em>)&mdash;a position defended in particular by Thomas
Aquinas (Imbach 1997; Robin 2009). According to this doctrine, the
possible intellect receives a light from God, the light of glory,
which comforts and supports it until it can rise to the grasp of God
in essence.</p>

<p>
Dietrich rejects any theory of supernatural illumination. Drawing
again on Averroes, he defends that the beatific vision comes about
through a junction with the agent intellect. In this junction, the
agent intellect unites with the human intellect as its form, enabling
it to intellectually grasp the very intellection through which it
knows itself, and to be then essentially turned toward God. When fully
joined to the agent intellect&mdash;if the intellect becomes the
soul&rsquo;s form&mdash; the human intellect can understand everything
all at once. In this union, the human intellect understands the entire
universe of beings in a single mental act. When the agent intellect
unites with the intellectual soul as its form, it can then know in the
mode by which the intellect knows itself, its intellectuality and its
act. This is how it can know through its essence, and be immediately
turned toward God. This junction with the agent intellect forms the
highest point of intellectual knowledge, where the human soul rises to
pure intellectuality through its own natural forces. The grasp of the
highest object, God, is the climax of Dietrich of Freiberg&rsquo;s
noetics.</p>

<h3 id="TheCon">4.2 Theological controversies</h3>

<p>
Dietrich of Freiberg tackles famous theological problems of his time
in several treatises, collected under the incipit of the &lsquo;Three
Difficult Questions&rsquo; (<em>DA</em>, <em>DVB</em>, <em>DAC</em>),
which are polemical in scope. One of these problems concerned the
ontological status of accidents. The requirements of the Christian
faith and, in particular, the belief that bread is changed into
Christ&rsquo;s body during the Eucharist had led many theologians of
the time to accept the idea that accidents can subsist&mdash;although
supernaturally&mdash;without their subject of inherence, i.e., without
a substance. In his <em>De accidentibus</em>, as well as in his <em>De
quiditatibus entium</em>, Dietrich demonstrates the inseparability of
accidents from substances. Following Averroes, he defines accidents as
beings of being (<em>entia entis</em>) and modes or dispositions of
being (<em>modi entium</em> / <em>dispositiones entium</em>). As such,
accidents can neither be nor be defined by themselves: accidents exist
only in virtue of substances and thus exist by another (<em>per aliud
seu secundum aliud</em>; cf. <em>DA</em>, 8, 63&ndash;4).</p>

<p>
Consequently, Dietrich criticizes the definition of accidents by their
being of inherence (<em>in esse</em> / <em>esse in alio</em>) which
fosters the idea that they may possess a minimal being
(<em>inesse</em>) by which they could subsist independently of a
substance. In so doing, he rejects the common doctrine that promotes
an additional model of accidents upon the substance, whose role would
be to sustain and support them. Moreover, Dietrich targets the
dominant doctrine of the separability of accidents through quantity
(cf. Thomas Aquinas or Bonaventura, <em>In IV Sent</em>., dist. 12).
His argument undermines such rational explanations of the dogmas of
the Eucharist and Transubstantiation, detrimental to both rigorous
philosophy and the true Faith (Imbach 1986/1998).&nbsp;Substance is
not what supports accidents, but what substantiates and quiddifies
them (that without which they cannot be nor be defined).&nbsp;Without
elaborating further on the theological implications of his theory,
Dietrich concludes that accidents are absolutely inseparable
(<em>DA</em>, 19 (1)).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In his <em>De corpore Christi mortuo</em>, Dietrich deals with another
theological controversy of his time having important philosophical
implications, namely whether one should appeal to a bodily substantial
form distinct from the soul to account for the well-known problem of
the <em>triduum</em>, i.e., the problem of how to explain the identity
of Christ&rsquo;s body during the three days between his death and
resurrection. Dietrich firmly rejects this view, held by some
philosophers and theologians of his time (mostly&mdash;though not
exclusively&mdash;Franciscan thinkers) admitting a plurality of
substantial forms in corporeal substances. As in the case of the
Eucharist, Dietrich refrains from offering a positive explanation of
this miracle. But he denies that the plurality of essential predicates
constituting an essence (for example, rationality and animality in the
case of the human being) constitutes a good reason to support the
plurality of substantial forms&mdash;an argument often advanced to
support this view (<em>DCCM</em> 4, 150). Like Aquinas, he thus stands
in favor of the unicity of the substantial form. In connection with
his theory of intellection, he interprets the plurality of essential
predicates as different formal intentions (<em>intentiones
formales</em>) through which the intellect apprehends a single,
unified form (<em>DORP</em>, 4 (33), 178). As indicated
above&mdash;and as this last remark about the role of the intellect in
resolving ontological questions further
illustrates&mdash;Dietrich&rsquo;s noetics is closely tied not only to
his theological views but also to his metaphysics, inviting us to turn
now to his metaphysical framework as a key to better understanding
what precedes.</p>

<h2 id="Met">5. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Metaphysics, for its part, is defined by Dietrich as the science of
what is <em>per se</em> (substance) and its consequent properties
(<em>DORP</em>, 1 (12), 140&ndash;1; see Decaix 2013). The
metaphysician (<em>philosophus primus</em>) proceeds from the
reconduction of accidental and contingent relationships to essential,
inherently necessary ones (Flasch 2008; K&ouml;nig-Pralong 2009).
Furthermore, efficient and final causes are excluded from metaphysical
consideration. Consequently, metaphysics is concerned with the
essential elements of being, form and matter, and is the science that
grasps being <em>per se</em>&mdash; the substance&mdash;on the basis
of its form and quiddity (<em>DORP</em>, 5 (59), 199). As such,
metaphysics has its own defined subject, which should not be confused
with the divine science of philosophers, <em>scientia divina
philosophorum</em>, nor with revealed theology, <em>scientia divina
sanctorum</em> (cf. <em>De subiecto theologiae</em>).</p>

<h3 id="EssExi">5.1 Essence and existence</h3>

<p>
Dietrich has devoted extensive analyses of the key metaphysical terms
<em>esse</em>, <em>ens</em>, <em>entitas</em>, <em>quid</em>, and
<em>quiditas</em>. In his treatise <em>De ente et essentia,</em> he
strictly rejects any real distinction between essence and existence,
targeting Aquinas. He endorses the thesis that there is no distinction
outside the mind between existence (<em>esse</em>) and essence
(<em>essentia</em>). The existence of a thing expresses its essence
and vice versa. According to Dietrich, the two notions differ only in
the way they denote the thing of which they are predicated (<em>in
modis significandi</em>): existence expresses being in the mode of an
act, while essence expresses it in the mode of a possession and of the
term of an act. Dietrich correlates his thesis of the real identity of
existence and essence with his concept of being, both in its concrete
form as <em>ens</em> or particular being and its abstract form as
<em>entitas</em>. <em>Ens</em> denotes the essence of whatever is a
determinate existing individual, while <em>entitas</em> denotes in an
abstract manner. Strikingly, while Dietrich&rsquo;s work shows little
interest in logical and semantic issues, it is through a resolution
influenced by the so-called &ldquo;Modists&rdquo; (<em>modistae</em>)
that he unravels metaphysical issues regarding essence and
existence.</p>

<p>
Being (<em>ens</em>) is for Dietrich the most basic of all
metaphysical concepts and the first transcendental of which he gives
an original account: being is what differentiates or separates itself
from nothingness (<em>distat</em> /<em>differt a nihilo</em>;
see&nbsp;<em>DEE</em>, I.2 (2), 28&ndash;9; I.4 (2), 31;
<em>DORP</em>, 1 (4), 138; 1 (25), 144; <em>DNC</em> 15 (1),
94&ndash;5). Both <em>ens</em> and <em>entitas</em> identify with
essence. Therefore, one could say, according to Dietrich, that in
considering a white ball, for example, its <em>ens</em> is white, its
<em>entitas</em> is whiteness, and its essence is that through which
it is white and participates in whiteness. It is the &ldquo;very
beingness of the thing, and hence that through which it may be said to
stand outside of nothingness.&rdquo;(Maurer 1956)</p>

<h3 id="ForQui">5.2 Form and quiddity</h3>

<p>
One of Dietrich&rsquo;s most distinctive positions concerns the
relationship between form, on the one hand, and essence and quiddity,
on the other hand. A recurring question in medieval metaphysics and
anthropology&mdash;arising due to the then-dominant framework of
Aristotelian hylomorphism&mdash;was whether the essence or quiddity of
a being is identical to its form alone, or rather to the composite of
matter and form; that is, in the case of the human being, whether it
is the soul alone or the composite of soul and body. The first option,
often (though maybe wrongly) attributed to Averroes, had very few
defenders prior to the late thirteenth century. Dietrich, however,
accepts that quiddity is in fact identical with form alone, although
the form does not constitute the whole essence of a composite being
(<em>DQE</em>, 8 (3), 111).</p>

<p>
To understand this point, a few words about the term
&lsquo;quiddity&rsquo; are in order. Compared to his analysis of the
terms &lsquo;essence&rsquo; (<em>essentia</em>) and
&lsquo;being&rsquo; (<em>esse</em>), Dietrich&rsquo;s account of
<em>quid</em> and <em>quiditas</em> is more limited.
While&nbsp;<em>ens</em>, <em>entitas</em>, <em>esse</em>, and
<em>essentia</em> are all existential terms answering the question
whether something exists, in the <em>De quiditatibus entium,</em>
Dietrich&nbsp;considers the question &ldquo;<em>What</em> is it that
exists?&rdquo; He begins the treatise by distinguishing <em>quid</em>
and <em>quiditas</em> from existential terms (<em>DQE</em>, 1, 99),
and then proceeds to consider the differences with respect to being in
substance, in logical concepts or intentions, and in accidents. Unlike
Aquinas, who was more inclined to equate <em>essentia</em> and
<em>quiditas</em>, Dietrich sees these metaphysical concepts as
different, though not completely unrelated.</p>

<p>
The analysis which <em>De quiditatibus entium</em> provides is subtle.
The term <em>quid</em> denotes the essential mode of the being of a
thing, that is, the mode of being by which it exists as a being of a
certain kind. It answers the question &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
(<em>DQE</em>, 8 (4), 112). On the other hand, the abstract term
<em>quiditas</em> denotes the formality by means of which a thing is a
<em>quid</em>. It is tempting to see a connection here between
<em>ens</em>, <em>entitas</em> and <em>quid</em>, <em>quiditas</em>
such that the second is the condition of the first. This may lead
unwary reasoners, as Dietrich no doubt felt Thomas Aquinas and others
were, into completely equating <em>entitas</em> and <em>quiditas</em>.
But <em>quiditas</em> only denotes the formal determination of a
thing. It is thus only the form of a thing. Hence the quiddity can be
fully equated neither with the being (either the <em>ens</em> or the
<em>entitas</em>) of a thing nor with its essence, although the
quiddity presupposes a being.</p>

<p>
The quiddity gives a being its specific intrinsic character by means
of which it can be known. Insofar as Dietrich assimilates the question
&ldquo;<em>quid est?</em>&rdquo; to the question &ldquo;<em>propter
quid?</em>&rdquo; (i.e., to what end?), which serves to inquire into
the intrinsic causes explaining why a material being is what it is, he
claims that quiddity is, strictly speaking, only found in composite
beings where a form determines some matter (<em>DQE</em>, 3,
101&ndash;3; 8, 111&ndash;2). Unlike Aquinas, thus, Dietrich employs
the term &ldquo;quiddity&rdquo; neither to designate the whole
composite nor to refer to immaterial beings. As a consequence, God and
the Intelligences do not have quiddities since they are simple beings.
Dietrich indeed strictly rejects what is sometimes called
&ldquo;universal hylomorphism,&rdquo; namely, the idea that all beings
possess some matter, including separate substances that have a kind of
matter of their own, distinct from corporeal matter (cf.
<em>USS</em>).</p>

<h3 id="UniEntHieUni">5.3 <em>Universitas entium</em>: A hierarchical universe</h3>

<p>
The creation that results from divine intellectual activity, however,
takes the form of a hierarchy of beings that, according to Dietrich,
constitutes the structure of the universe. We can note that Dietrich
often employs the term <em>universitas</em> to refer to the totality
of what exists, a term by which he emphasizes that the hierarchical
universe as he understood it includes all beings, even the divine
being. According to Dietrich, the hierarchy of beings can be explained
through their essential relations to each other in the universe, that
is, by the essential place they occupy in the chain of beings. In this
chain, in which God is at the top, every being is essentially ordered
to some other being as either its cause or its effect.
&ldquo;God,&rdquo; Dietrich tells us in the first part of <em>De
intellectu et intelligibili</em>, &ldquo;means that than which nothing
is superior, which stands in need of nothing with respect to either
being or operation&rdquo; (<em>DII</em>, I.7 (1), 140). All other
beings are ordered under God and to each other in an essential
ordering.</p>

<p>
One of the key concepts in his thought&mdash;of Neoplatonic
origin&mdash;is that of essential cause (<em>causa essentialis</em>),
which serves as the keystone of his entire system (Mojsisch 1984;
Decaix 2014). An essential cause is one that pre-contains in a nobler
mode, i.e., more interior and essential, its effect (<em>DAC</em>, 8
(2), 19). In <em>De cognitione entium separatorum</em> (<em>DCES</em>,
23, 186&ndash;87), Dietrich sets out five conditions for something to
be the essential cause of something else. It must be: 1) a substance,
2) living, 3) by essence, i.e., essentially alive, 4) living an
intellectual life, 5) an intellect by essence in act. This implies, on
the one hand, that no body as such can exercise this kind of
causality: bodies act only by virtue of their extrinsic accidents,
which excludes them from the essential order of <em>universitas
entium</em>. On the other hand, this causality unifies several
distinct states into one whole: God, simple Intelligences, separate
substances, celestial orbs and souls, and the agent intellect.</p>

<p>
In light of this emanationist model, Dietrich follows Proclus in
classifying the various kinds of beings that constitute the total
hierarchy of being and distinguishes four main classes of beings, in a
decreasing order of dignity and ontological priority (<em>DII</em>,
I.4 (2), 138; <em>DCES</em>, 9 (2), 175):</p>

<ol>
<li>God, i.e., Proclus&rsquo; One</li>

<li>The Intelligences</li>

<li>Souls</li>

<li>Bodies</li>
</ol>

<p>
Using material found in Proclus, the <em>Liber de causis</em>, and
Avicenna&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>, Dietrich explains the order of
the procession of these four kinds of beings as follows: From God
there proceeds that which is called the first Intelligence. From the
first intelligence the second intelligence flows forth along with the
soul of the first celestial sphere and the first celestial sphere
itself. This is the second stage. Then the process is repeated with
the procession of the third intelligence, the soul of the second
heaven, the second heaven itself, on down through all the celestial
worlds until the intelligence and soul of the lowest heaven and the
lowest heaven itself is reached. Thus all four kinds of beings are
accounted for and are ordered according to their place in the
celestial procession.</p>

<p>
Each manner of being also corresponds to a measure of duration
(<em>mensura durationis</em>), i.e., a distinct mode of temporality,
according to the place each occupies in the universe of beings, and
according to their relationship to God (Colli 2009). In his <em>De
mensuris</em>, Dietrich attributes a distinct temporal mode to each of
the four modes of being, according to its relation to God, to the
others and to itself (<em>in se</em>). To God, who precedes the
existence of the universe, he assigns eternity (<em>eternitas)</em>,
which has neither an initial nor a final term. To the second (the
world, the celestial orbs), sempiternity (<em>sempiternitas</em>), or
perpetuity (<em>perpetuita</em>s), as that which has a beginning, but
no end. To the third (simple Intelligence, Angels), eviternity
(<em>aevum</em>). To the fourth, material created things are
corruptible, time (<em>tempus</em>), as they possess a beginning and
an end, are subject to succession, and are caught up in past, present
and future temporal dimensions.&nbsp;For its part, time
(<em>tempus</em>), a specific dimension to the physical realm of
material things, is as a successive continuous. Following Aristotle,
it is defined as the &ldquo;number of movement according to anterior
and posterior&rdquo; (<em>Physics</em>, IV, 10&ndash;14). However,
influenced by Averroes&rsquo; commentary, Dietrich emphasizes the
activity of the soul as the primary and proximate cause of time
(<em>DNPC</em>, 5). The soul therefore plays an active role with
respect to time: sensation perceives movement; reason grasps an
interval of duration and establishes the order of succession between a
&ldquo;before and after&rdquo;, which is the substance of time, and
the definition of time in its quiddity is determined by the
intellect.</p>

<p>
In this hierarchically ordered universe, Dietrich posits a principle
of continuity that operates at various levels and ensures its unity.
Whereas the separate Intelligences are produced by way of emanation
from the first principle&mdash;that is, God&mdash;the things of the
sublunary world come into being through natural transmutation, that
is, through motion involving matter. Between these two opposed modes
of coming into being, the heavens and celestial bodies represent an
intermediate mode of existence (<em>DAC</em>, 9&ndash;10, 20&ndash;2).
Although they belong to corporeal nature, celestial bodies are not
subject to generation and corruption; nor do they proceed directly
from the divine intellect, as do the separate Intelligences. They are
moved neither <em>per emanationem</em> nor <em>per
transmutationem</em> but <em>per informationem</em>, i.e., by an
Intelligence (or celestial soul) that constitutes their intrinsic
formal principle&mdash;unlike sublunary bodies, whose motion is caused
by an external mover (<em>DAC</em>, 15, 26).</p>

<p>
This subtle hierarchical ordering of the genera of beings composing
the universe can also be seen in Dietrich&rsquo;s effort to
distinguish celestial Intelligences (themselves distinct from pure
Intelligences, which are completely separate from the corporeal realm)
from angels: although angels are intellectual creatures, they are not
&lsquo;intellects by essence&rsquo; and therefore possess a different
ontological status&mdash;one marked by contingency, a certain
passivity, and a kind of composition between various cognitive powers
(<em>DAC</em>, 19&ndash;28, 29&ndash;36). As we can see, then, the
four-level hierarchy of beings inspired by Proclus represents only the
general structure of a layered universe, which in fact contains a much
more finely articulated internal differentiation&mdash;one that
depends on the distinction between several types of intellects and
corresponding modes of conception (see Section 3.2), as well as on the
distinction between different types of souls and their different
relations to corporeality.</p>

<p>
The entire universe of beings is in a state of active procession of
all creatures from God. Even at the lowest rank of the order of
beings, i.e., at the level of bodies, there is also a dynamic at work,
for bodies in their natural desire for form are in the process of
returning to their source. Quoting directly from Proclus, he remarks
that what is desirable to all things is intellect and that all things
proceed from intellect as well as return through it. But he restrains
himself from making any theological identity. It is clear, however,
that love marks all the ranks of the hierarchy, every member of which
is driven to return to its source by desire for intellect. Tacitly,
Dietrich has left the door open for the interpretation that the God
who is love as reported in Sacred Scripture has left the mark of that
love in the universe of beings and that intellect (often identified by
the earlier Christian Neoplatonists with the second Person of the
Trinity) is the crucial agent in both the unfolding and retrieval of
being.</p>

<h2 id="NatPhi">6. Natural philosophy</h2>

<p>
We have seen that Dietrich viewed the complexity of the universe of
being as itself a likeness to God. The world in all of its wonderful
complexity revealed something of God to a mind willing to inquire into
it, giving glory to God in its very complexity. Perhaps
Dietrich&rsquo;s metaphysical vision of the universe explains his keen
interest in science, an interest that led him to write treatises
summing up his research into light and color and into the material
elements of the universe. At any rate, Dietrich&rsquo;s intellectual
interests included the study of nature and its particular phenomena.
Clearly less concerned than some of his contemporaries with the most
general questions of the natural philosophy of his time&mdash;such as
&ldquo;What defines nature as such?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is
motion?&rdquo;&mdash;often prompted by commentaries on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> (a genre he set aside in favor of
shorter treatises on natural philosophy), Dietrich showed a marked
interest in concrete explanatory inquiries into phenomena such as the
rainbow, colors, or celestial motions. The present section aims to
present some of Dietrich&rsquo;s most noteworthy theories in natural
philosophy which, as will become clear, are grounded in and consistent
with the views previously outlined, thus avoiding any chasm between
his metaphysics and his science.</p>

<h3 id="SciMet">6.1 Scientific method</h3>

<p>
A few preliminary remarks on the nature of Dietrich&rsquo;s scientific
method are necessary at this point. It has been argued that the
remarkable results he achieved&mdash;notably his explanation of the
rainbow&mdash;can be attributed to his adoption of a distinctive
scientific method, one reflecting a transitional stage between the
qualitative paradigm of Aristotelian physics and the quantified
approach that would later characterize modern science (Wallace 1959).
In reality, however, assessing the precise methods followed by
Dietrich in his investigations of natural phenomena proves to be quite
difficult. The extant texts do not provide a clear account of his
methodological procedures; rather, they present, in the form of
treatises, the conclusions he reaches, modeled on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Posterior Analytics</em>&mdash;that is, as <em>propter quid</em>
explanations, or demonstrations through causes (Grant 1961; Sturlese
1985, xiii-xviii; Flasch 2007, 19&ndash;60). Moreover,
Dietrich&rsquo;s scientific expositions often contain an inseparable
metaphysical dimension. He frequently seeks to explain particular
sensible phenomena by tracing them back to the most general causes
that govern the behavior of beings in the universe. To give just one
example: the analysis of contrariety in the <em>Tractatus de natura
contrariorum</em> is ultimately aimed at explaining the movement of
contrary qualities in nature. Yet the treatise employs a complex
combinatorial framework that draws upon Dietrich&rsquo;s theory of the
transcendentals (Aertsen 1999; Flasch 2007, 439&ndash;70; Roudaut
2020). It is nonetheless clear that Dietrich relied on careful
observation of phenomena, as well as on a rudimentary form of
experimentation&mdash;traces of which can be found in his writings,
particularly in optics&mdash;even though it remains difficult to
assess the sophistication of these experimental procedures or their
exact role within his scientific approach. Similarly, Dietrich makes
explicit use of mathematics&mdash;especially geometry&mdash;in the
field of optics (Husson 2009). By contrast, his writings on qualities
and motion show no evidence of the quantitative methods that will
later emerge in 14th-century physics, and thus remain within a
paradigm that may still be described as qualitative.</p>

<h3 id="OptLigCol">6.2 Optics, light, and colors</h3>

<p>
The works for which Dietrich has most attracted the attention of
historians of science concern optics and the theory of light. He
devoted specific treatises, respectively, to light, to color, and to
the rainbow. His theory of light and its causes reveals the deep
interweaving of metaphysical and physical considerations throughout
his thought. Dietrich explains the behavior of light&mdash;its
capacity to be transmitted through different media and to manifest
itself instantaneously therein&mdash;by reference to the kinds of
&ldquo;parts&rdquo; that bodies possess. In the <em>De luce et eius
origine</em>, he develops a detailed typology of the parts of a body,
showing that certain properties are such that bodies suitably disposed
to receive them remain in potency with respect to them until an
external agent brings them into act (<em>DLEO</em>, 11&ndash;13,
18&ndash;20). This characterization of certain types of parts explains
why these properties&mdash;like light&mdash;do not have a positive
contrary and manifest themselves instantaneously in a medium capable
of receiving them. Dietrich establishes these properties of light
through a typology of forms, within which he identifies a type of what
he calls &ldquo;perfectional forms,&rdquo; which appear to be distinct
from the usual division of forms into substantial and accidental.
Remarkably, this notion also appears in his <em>Quaestio utrum in Deo
sit aliqua vis cognitiva inferior intellectu</em>, where he uses it to
account for the modes of operation of the divine intellect. This
reinforces the close parallel he draws&mdash;within a broadly
Neoplatonic framework&mdash;between light and intellection, a parallel
that will be further developed by Berthold of Moosburg, on whom
Dietrich&rsquo;s influence will be of primary importance (Roudaut
2022).</p>

<p>
Dietrich treats both the problem of radiant colors (as in the case of
the rainbow) and that of natural colors, namely those present in
natural bodies. His theory of natural color reflects a dynamic
approach to the phenomenon. According to Dietrich, natural colors can
be explained through a particular conception of the
&ldquo;complexion&rdquo;&nbsp;of corporeal substances&mdash;a notion
that suggests the likely influence of medical theories on his
reflections in this area (<em>DC</em>, 7, 281&ndash;2; see Wallace
1959, 152&ndash;73, 188&ndash;205; Flasch 2007, 627&ndash;77; Decaix
2024). This conception leads him to reject the Aristotelian-inspired
theory that identifies red, green, and blue as the only intermediary
colors (between the extremes of black and white) and regards yellow as
merely an optical illusion (<em>DC</em> 6 (1), 281). The degree to
which Dietrich may have employed experimentation to support his
analysis remains a matter of debate (Crombie 1953, 233&ndash;59; Boyer
1959, 110&ndash;28).</p>

<p>
Dietrich&rsquo;s theory of the rainbow builds upon and extends that of
Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen), on which it explicitly
relies. Like Ibn al-Haytham, Dietrich employs geometry to demonstrate
the principles of reflection and refraction of light within a watery
medium. However, much like the contemporary scholar Kam&#257;l
al-D&#299;n al-F&#257;ris&#299;&mdash;despite there being no known
historical link or transmission between them&mdash;Dietrich takes the
explanation further. He shows that the refraction of light entering a
droplet, its internal reflection, and its subsequent refraction upon
exiting the droplet can account not only for the primary rainbow, but
also for the secondary rainbow (Crombie 1953, 233&ndash;77; Wallace
1959, 188&ndash;96). He further explains the specific angle at which
these phenomena occur, thereby accounting for the relative positions
of the primary and secondary rainbows (<em>DIRI</em>, II.25,
189&ndash;90; II.39, 210&ndash;2; II.42&ndash;43, 215&ndash;6). By
demonstrating that the secondary rainbow is caused by an internal
reflection occurring between the two refractions of light traveling
through a watery medium, he explains the reversal of color order
between the primary and secondary rainbows (<em>DIRI</em>, II.29,
195&ndash;6).</p>

<h3 id="EleMix">6.3 Elements and mixtures</h3>

<p>
The notion of mixture occupies a significant place in Dietrich&rsquo;s
natural philosophy. He draws upon the concept of complexion in his
theory of color and, as we will see, seeks to explain the motion of
natural bodies on the basis of a classification of the role played by
the parts within a body. A central question in the physics of
Dietrich&rsquo;s time concerned the structure of mixed bodies and the
precise status of the elements that compose them. Three principal
theories contended on this issue, discussed in Dietrich&rsquo;s <em>De
miscibilibus in mixto</em>: The first, inspired by Avicenna, holds
that the elements retain their substantial forms&mdash;distinct from
their elemental qualities (such as heat, cold, etc.)&mdash;in act
within the compound. The second, attributed to Averroes, maintains
that the substantial forms of the elements are corrupted in the
mixture (since otherwise the mixture would lack its own substantial
unity), but that they nevertheless remain &lsquo;virtually&rsquo;
insofar as their qualities or powers (<em>virtutes</em>) persist in
some manner. A third theory, also traceable to Averroes and best
described as intermediate, posits that the substantial forms of the
elements remain in the mixture in a diminished or attenuated
state&mdash;an idea that implies a certain gradation or variability in
substantial forms. It is worth noting that all of these positions
presuppose that the elements possess substantial forms distinct from
their qualities. Dietrich adopts the third view, which he considers
the most adequate for explaining the role of the elements in the
behavior of a compound, while avoiding the respective shortcomings of
the two opposing extremes (<em>DMIM</em>, 20&ndash;21,
46&ndash;7).</p>

<h3 id="NatMot">6.4 Natural motions</h3>

<p>
In several of his works, Dietrich offers detailed explanations of the
natural motion of bodies&mdash;whether of sublunary bodies (especially
in his <em>De elementis corporum naturalium</em>) or of celestial
motions (in his <em>De animatione caeli</em>, <em>De intelligentiis et
motoribus caelorum</em>, <em>De corporibus caelestibus quoad naturam
eorum corporalem,</em> and in a short <em>Quaestio utrum sunt epicyli
et excentrici in corporibus caelestibus</em>). In his <em>De elementis
corporum naturalium</em>, he undertakes to elucidate the causes of the
variety of motions according to place (i.e., local motion) observed in
nature. A guiding idea in his explanation of the different types of
motion exhibited by sensible bodies is the need to distinguish between
the simplicity or compositeness of bodies and the simplicity or
compositeness of their motions: the composite character of a motion
(e.g., partly rectilinear, partly circular) does not necessarily
indicate that the body in motion is itself composite, just as the
composite nature of a body does not necessarily entail a composite
motion (<em>DECN</em>, 13&ndash;15, 69&ndash;71; cf. Wallace 1961).
Certainly, a natural element (such as fire or water), in the absence
of external constraints, moves rectilinearly toward its natural place.
But more generally, in line with his broader tendency to reduce
accidents to the corporeal dispositions of substances, Dietrich
insists that one must analyze the types of parts composing a body in
order to explain its motion, as well as the role these parts play in
the movement of the body as a whole. More precisely, the parts of a
body may move the body as a whole (as in the case of a simple element)
or only in part (as in the case of animal movement). By combining this
criterion with the influence of external forces that constrain motion,
Dietrich accounts for the variety of celestial, elemental, and
sublunary motions&mdash;including the behavior of fluid bodies like
rivers or clouds (<em>DECN</em> 20&ndash;21, 73).</p>

<p>
On the basis of these explanatory principles, he also seeks to explain
certain aspects of celestial motions and the natural phenomena related
to them. Dietrich indeed holds that the celestial bodies are composed
of matter, although this matter is not of the same kind as that of
generable and corruptible beings in the sublunary realm (<em>Tractatus
de corporibus caelestibus</em>, 1 (7&ndash;9), 380). This celestial
matter, because it possesses dimensions, makes these bodies subject to
local motion and to the laws governing it. While Dietrich attributes
the primary cause of celestial motion to Intelligences (or celestial
souls, which he distinguishes from angels) that serve as their
intrinsic formal principles, the specific trajectories of the
celestial spheres are, in his view, also determined by the
distribution of matter, which constrains their local movement. Thus,
several facts can be explained by admitting the existence of multiple
centers of gravity in the natural world, depending on the distribution
of matter in the universe, which do not always coincide with its
geometric center (<em>DIMC</em>, 17, 368). Explanations based on the
distribution of mass in nature better account, on the one hand, for
astronomical observations that contradict the strictly circular motion
of the heavens posited by Aristotle&mdash;leading him to prefer the
Ptolemaic system (<em>DIMC</em>, 13 (3), 365&ndash;6). On the other
hand, this hypothesis also serves to limit the total number of
celestial spheres to nine, avoiding the need to posit, as Albert the
Great did, a hypothetical tenth sphere to account for phenomena such
as the retrograde motion of the planets (<em>DIMC</em>, 3, 357). On
these grounds, Dietrich also tries to explain the phenomenon of tides,
although he includes in this explanation qualitative hypotheses
(involving the salinity of seawater) that make his theory outdated
today (<em>DECN</em>, 24, 75&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
In his short treatise <em>De magis et minus</em>, Dietrich also
addresses the important contemporary problem of explaining intensive
variations in quality, i.e., the so-called <em>de intensione
formarum</em> controversy (Conolly 2014; Flasch 2007, 411&ndash;38).
Contrary to a growing trend at the time to explain intensive
variations of properties such as color or heat through a model of
addition&mdash;according to which degrees or parts of a form are
quantitatively accumulated to produce a more intense
quality&mdash;Dietrich maintains that intensive variation involves the
production of a new individual quality at each instant (an idea also
defended by several philosophers active in Paris around the turn of
the 14th century like Godfrey of Fontaines or Walter Burley). However,
he concedes that qualitative variations presuppose something akin to
quantitative increase (<em>quasi incrementum</em>), without
constituting proper addition (<em>DMM</em>, 12 (4), 56). Here again,
one may appreciate the internal coherence of Dietrich&rsquo;s
positions at the intersection of physics and metaphysics: just as in
his treatment of the problem of the plurality of substantial forms, he
refuses to admit any real composition within a form, which he regards
as a unified entity distinct from the compositionality proper to
physical bodies.</p>

<p>
The exact influence of Dietrich of Freiberg in the history of
philosophy and science remains, to a large extent, yet to be
determined. His relative neglect over a long historical period was no
doubt due to his anti-Thomist positions at a time when the
canonization of Thomas Aquinas (in 1323) was reinforcing both the
dissemination of his works and the doctrinal authority attached to
them, and also partly due to Dietrich&rsquo;s lost works&mdash;not
least his commentary on the <em>Sentences</em>. As a result,
Dietrich&rsquo;s influence was more limited than that of some of his
contemporaries, with whom his philosophical originality easily
rivaled. Nonetheless, Dietrich exerted a direct influence on thinkers
of his time, beginning with philosophers of the Dominican order. In
addition to his attested interactions with Master Eckhart and John
Picard of Lichtenberg, Dietrich also influenced Nicholas of Strasbourg
and, to a much greater extent, Berthold of Moosburg. Nothing, at this
stage of our knowledge of the history of ideas, excludes the
possibility&mdash;indeed quite the contrary&mdash;of direct or
indirect influences on other authors at the end of the Middle Ages and
during the Renaissance. It remains the task of future studies to
determine the exact role of this remarkable figure in the history of
philosophy.</p>
