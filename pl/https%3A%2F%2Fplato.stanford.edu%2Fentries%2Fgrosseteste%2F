<div id="preamble">

<p>
Robert Grosseteste (ca. 1168&ndash;1253), Bishop of Lincoln from 1235
to 1253, was one of the most prominent and remarkable figures in
thirteenth-century English intellectual life. A philosopher,
theologian, and student of nature, Grosseteste also translated and
commented on works by Aristotle and Greek patristic thinkers. He
played a pivotal role in the development of Aristotelianism, being
among the first Latin philosophers to incorporate theories of Avicenna
and Averroes, while also drawing heavily from Augustine. Grosseteste
crafted a highly original and imaginative account of the creation and
fundamental structure of the physical world, grounded in the concept
of the action of light. His writings encompass numerous treatises on
natural phenomena, as well as works in philosophy and theology. In his
ecclesiastical capacity as bishop, Grosseteste actively addressed
pastoral care issues, striving to rectify abuses within the church,
and in his later years, he even traced some of these issues to the
papacy itself. Revered by his contemporaries and later scholars at
Oxford, Grosseteste has been often celebrated as an inspiration to
scientific developments in fourteenth-century Britain.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Lif">1. Life</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste was born in the county of Suffolk in England, possibly
around 1168 (Callus 1955). Around 1195, in a letter to the Bishop of
Hereford, William de Vere, Gerald of Wales commends Grosseteste for
his wide reading and skill in business and legal affairs, medicine,
and the liberal arts, and remarks on his exceptional standards of
conduct. Grosseteste appears as a papal judge-delegate in Litchfield
diocese before 1216 and in Hereford diocese between 1213 and 1216,
acting with Hugh Foliot, Archdeacon of Shropshire. For at least part
of the years 1208 to 1213, when England was under papal interdict,
Grosseteste was in France, for in a death-bed conversation reported by
the chronicler Matthew Paris he recalls having seen and heard
preaching in France by Eustace of Flay, James of Vitry, Robert of
Courson and the exiled Archbishop Steven Langton. In 1225, while still
a deacon, Grosseteste was presented by the Bishop of Lincoln, Hugh of
Wells, to the living of Abbotsley. In 1229 he was made Archdeacon of
Leicester and presented with a prebend in Lincoln Cathedral.</p>

<p>
Scholars have proposed various reconstructions of Grosseteste&rsquo;s
life between 1200 and 1230. The debate revolves around his activities
before moving to France, during his time in France, and upon his
return to England. Regarding his pre-France period, Daniel Callus
(1945, 1955, with Crombie 1953 and McEvoy 1982, 2000 in substantial
agreement) posits that Grosseteste may have taught arts at Oxford. In
contrast, Sir Richard Southern (1986) emphasizes that Grosseteste
likely held an administrative position with occasional teaching
duties. The disagreement continues into Grosseteste&rsquo;s time in
France. Callus suggests that Grosseteste moved to France in 1209
following a town-and-gown dispute in Oxford and studied theology
there. Southern rejects this view, maintaining that Grosseteste
relocated due to the papal interdict of England, and during this
period, he did not engage in theological studies.</p>

<p>
The complexity intensifies when examining Grosseteste&rsquo;s
activities upon his return from France. Callus argues that Grosseteste
likely returned from France in 1214, becoming Oxford&rsquo;s first
chancellor in function, if not in title. Southern instead suggests
that Grosseteste&rsquo;s permanent association with Oxford started
after 1225 when, having received the prebend of Abbotsley, Grosseteste
probably became a priest and began lecturing in theology. Joseph
Goering (1995), in turn, proposes that Grosseteste returned to England
after 1215, working as a master of arts in Oxford throughout the
1220s. During that decade, Grosseteste may have returned to Paris for
theological studies, possibly around 1225, after receiving the
Abbotsley prebend. According to James Ginther (2000), Grosseteste
became regent master of theology around 1229/30, coinciding with his
role as a lecturer for the Oxford Franciscans. Nevertheless, Brett
Smith (2018: n. 34) expresses doubts about Ginther&rsquo;s claims.</p>

<p>
The reconstruction of the later period of Grosseteste&rsquo;s life
benefits from additional historical data. In 1224, the Franciscans
arrived at Oxford, and their Minister Provincial, Agnellus of Pisa,
established their first school. Agnellus requested Grosseteste to
lecture to them and, in 1229/30, Grosseteste began a formal
association with the Franciscans at Oxford as their first lecturer
(see Panti 2017a). In 1235, he was elected Bishop of Lincoln, a
responsibility that clashed with his teaching duties, prompting him to
relinquish them. However, Grosseteste maintained close relations with
the Franciscans throughout his life.</p>

<p>
In 1231, following a recovery from a severe illness, Grosseteste
resigned from all his sources of revenue, except his prebend in
Lincoln Cathedral. He proceeded to compose a series of significant
theological works, with the <em>Hexa&aelig;meron</em> being the most
notable. Starting from the early 1230s (see Dionisotti 1988),
Grosseteste began studying Greek. Assisted by individuals proficient
in the language, he undertook crucial translation projects, including
works by John of Damascus, Pseudo-Dionysius (accompanied by his own
original commentary), and Aristotle. The list includes the first
extant complete Latin translation of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
to circulate in the Latin West (see Beullens 2023b), along with
translations of numerous Greek commentary materials (see Panti 2023).
Grosseteste also translated substantial parts of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>De caelo</em> and Simplicius&rsquo;s commentary on it, apparently
in the late stages of his life.</p>

<p>
In the 1240s, the conflict between the emperor and the pope led to the
First Council of Lyon in 1245, in which Grosseteste participated. He
returned to the papal court in Lyon in 1250, expressing to the pope
his concerns about the failings of the church and its deviation from
its pastoral mission. In 1253, the last year of his life, Grosseteste
wrote an impassioned letter (#128) to the pope, refusing to obey the
pontifical instructions to confer a benefice on one of the
pope&rsquo;s nephews, whom he deemed unfit for pastoral care.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste passed away on October 8&ndash;9, 1253. Although
remembered by his contemporaries as a saintly man, three attempts to
canonize him (the last in 1307) ultimately failed.</p>

<h2 id="Wor">2. Works</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s extensive and diverse body of writings encompasses
works of various genres and domains, including scientific and
philosophical treatises, commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s and
biblical works, theological writings, sermon collections, letters, and
a substantial collection of short theological pieces known as the
<em>Dicta</em>. Additionally, Grosseteste ventured into Anglo-Norman
poetry. His works of philosophical interest can be classified as
follows:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li><strong>Scientific treatises</strong>. Grosseteste&rsquo;s early
scientific works, likely composed in the 1210s and 1220s, include

<ul>

<li><em>On the Liberal Arts</em> (<em>De artibus
liberalibus</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Generation of Sounds</em> (<em>De generatione
sonorum</em>), and</li>

<li><em>On the Sphere</em> (<em>De sphaera</em>).</li>
</ul> Expanding his scientific inquiry, Grosseteste later wrote on
specific natural problems in works like

<ul>

<li><em>On Comets</em> (<em>De cometis</em>),</li>

<li><em>On Lines, Angles, and Figures</em> (<em>De lineis, angulis et
figuris</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Nature of Places</em> (<em>De natura
locorum</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Rainbow</em> (<em>De iride</em>),</li>

<li><em>On Color</em> (<em>De colore</em>),</li>

<li><em>On Local Differences</em> (<em>De differentiis
localibus</em>), and</li>

<li><em>On the Movement of the Supercelestial Bodies</em> (<em>De motu
supercaelestium</em>)</li>
</ul> (for an outline, see Dales 1961 and Panti 2001). Further works
ascribed to Grosseteste, namely,

<ul>

<li><em>On the Heat of the Sun</em> (<em>De calore solis</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Tides</em> (<em>De fluxu et refluxu maris</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Generation of the Stars</em> (<em>De generatione
stellarum</em>), and</li>

<li><em>On the Impressions of the Air</em> (<em>De impressionibus
aeris</em>)</li>
</ul> are likely inauthentic, with the first two probably written by
Adam of Exeter (Panti 2013b).</li>

<li><strong>Philosophical treatises</strong>. Grosseteste composed
several short philosophical works, the most renowned of which is
<em>On Light</em> (<em>De luce</em>). Another noteworthy piece, <em>On
Bodily Movement and Light</em> (<em>De motu corporali et luce</em>)
shares a close thematic connection with <em>On Light</em>. In addition
to these, Grosseteste authored several treatises, including

<ul>

<li><em>On Potency and Act</em> (<em>De potentia et actu</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Halt of Causes</em> (<em>De statu causarum</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Subsistence of a Thing</em> (<em>De subsistentia
rei</em>),</li>

<li><em>On the Truth of the Proposition</em> (<em>De veritate
propositionis</em>), and</li>

<li><em>On the Finitude of Movement and Time</em> (<em>De finitate
motus et temporis</em>).</li>
</ul> </li>

<li><strong>Commentaries on Aristotle</strong>. Grosseteste wrote
commentaries on two Aristotelian works, namely, the <em>Posterior
Analytics</em> and the <em>Physics</em>, which are among the earliest
surviving commentaries on these works in the Latin West. The
commentary on the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>,
<strong>likely</strong> written in the 1220s, is an important source
for Grosseteste&rsquo;s epistemological views. The commentary on the
<em>Physics</em> appears to have been assembled by a later editor(s)
from notes Grosseteste had written in his copy of the <em>Physics</em>
to serve as the basis for a more structured commentary like that on
the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>. Although incomplete, these notes
comprise a substantial and coherent work, the bulk of which was also
probably written in the 1220s, with some later additions based on
Averroes&rsquo;s long commentary on the <em>Physics</em> (see Lewis
2003). Extant manuscripts also include a paraphrase of the <em>Prior
Analytics</em>, attributed to and possibly genuine to Grosseteste,
along with a commentary on the <em>Sophistici Elenchi</em> and a
second commentary on the <em>Physics</em> which, however, appear to be
inauthentic.</li>

<li><strong>Philosophical-theological works</strong>. Grosseteste
delved into the intricate intersection of philosophical and
theological inquiries through a series of works. Among them is <em>On
Free Decision</em> (<em>De libero arbitrio</em>), a relatively lengthy
exploration in two versions that confronts arguments challenging the
existence of free decision (<em>liberum arbitrium</em>). This work is
complemented by shorter treatises such as <em>On Truth</em> (<em>De
veritate</em>) and <em>On God&rsquo;s Knowledge</em> (<em>De scientia
Dei</em>), likely composed in the late 1220s or early 1230s. Another
notable contribution is found in <em>On the Order of the Emanation of
Caused Things from God</em> (<em>De ordine emamandi causatorum a
Deo</em>), where Grosseteste challenges the notion that an eternal
being can only create eternal creatures. In a lengthy letter addressed
to Adam Rufus (Adam of Exeter), Grosseteste explores the idea that God
is the form of all things, delving into the relationship between body
and soul and the celestial abode of angels. In the manuscripts, this
letter is often divided into two distinct works, <em>On the Unique
Form of all Things</em> (<em>De unica forma omnium</em>) and <em>On
the Intelligences</em> (<em>De intelligentiis</em>).</li>

<li><strong>Theological works of philosophical interest</strong>. Some
of Grosseteste&rsquo;s theological works carry notable philosophical
significance. In <em>On the Cessation of the Ceremonial Laws</em>
(<em>De cessatione legalium</em>), Grosseteste argues that the
Incarnation would have occurred even without the Fall, and touches on
the nature of human happiness and natural law. <em>On the Ten
Commandments</em> (<em>De decem mandatis</em>) offers glimpses into
Grosseteste&rsquo;s ethical thinking, while his theological
masterpiece, the <em>Hexa&aelig;meron</em>, thoroughly explores the
issue of the eternity of the world. Philosophically relevant material
is also present in the <em>Dicta</em>, some of Grosseteste&rsquo;s
later sermons (most notably the sermon <em>Ecclesia sancta
celebrat</em>, where he outlines his account of human nature), and his
commentaries on the Pseudo-Dionysius</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Sou">3. Sources</h2>

<p>
Being among the first Latin philosophers to systematically engage with
Aristotle, Grosseteste utilized a vast array of diverse sources. Among
them, a crucial role is played by philosophers from the Aristotelian
tradition and, crucially, the works of Aristotle, Avicenna, and
Averroes, which Grosseteste pioneered (Gauthier 1982). These sources
are complemented by theological works from both the Western tradition
(particularly Augustine, but also Boethius, Anselm, and Bernard of
Clairvaux) and, later in his life, the Eastern tradition (especially
John of Damascus, Basil, and Pseudo-Dionysius). Further sets of
sources used by Grosseteste encompass scientific works written or
translated into Latin, as well as Roman literature (especially Cicero
and Seneca).</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s <em>Tabula</em> (Rosemann 1995) offers an unusual
insight into these sources. This work is a topical concordance in
which Grosseteste lists readings on a wide range of topics of
theological and philosophical interest. For each topic, Grosseteste
associated a sign, allowing him quick access to the material in
question.</p>

<p>
While Grosseteste was undoubtedly influenced to some extent by his
contemporaries, his works display little concern to engage in debates
with them, contrasting with the practices of his peers in Paris. This
may reflect the provincial origin of Grosseteste&rsquo;s works and/or
a conservative preference to engage with the ideas of the great
thinkers of the philosophical and theological traditions.</p>

<h2 id="MetLig">4. The Metaphysics of Light</h2>

<p>
The concept of light holds a prominent position in Grosseteste&rsquo;s
writings, extending from his natural treatises to his ontological,
theological, and epistemological theories. Philosophically, his
utilization of the concept of light in explaining the fundamental
structure and origin of the physical universe stands out as profoundly
important and original. While he expounds on this theory most
comprehensively in <em>On Light</em>, traces of it also surface in his
commentaries on the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> and the
<em>Physics</em>, in <em>On Bodily Movement and Light</em>, and in his
commentary on <em>Ecclesiasticus</em> 43: 1&ndash;5, also known as
<em>On the Operations of the Sun</em>.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s metaphysics of light is anchored in his
hylomorphic account of the constitution of bodies. According to him,
all natural bodies are compounds of prime matter and substantial form.
Likely influenced by either Avicenna, Avicebron, or both (see Polloni
2021a, Lewis 2023), Grosseteste posits that all bodies possess a
bodily form (<em>forma corporalis</em>) extending prime matter into
three dimensions. This assertion suggests Grosseteste&rsquo;s
adherence to formal pluralism&mdash;a theory positing that physical
hylomorphic compounds have more than one substantial form alongside
prime matter (see Polloni 2021a). For example, in <em>On Light</em>,
Grosseteste maintains that the firmament (i.e., the outermost heavenly
sphere) is the simplest body, consisting solely of prime matter and
the first form (i.e., the bodily form). However, in his commentary on
the <em>Physics</em>, Grosseteste discusses the element fire,
attributing to it, in addition to the first form, the substantial form
of fire.</p>

<p>
The most original aspect of Grosseteste&rsquo;s account, however, lies
in his identification of the bodily form with light (<em>lux</em>).
<em>On Light</em> begins with an argument supporting this
identification. Grosseteste posits that the first form and prime
matter are inherently simple substances. Yet, the nature of bodiness
necessitates the extension of prime matter into three dimensions,
resulting in a quantified body. A simple form without dimension could
only achieve this effect if it instantaneously multiplied and diffused
itself in all directions, thereby extending prime matter along with
its diffusion. These characteristics align with those of light, which
is inherently self-multiplicative and self-diffusive&mdash;where a
sphere of light is instantaneously generated from a point of light.
Hence, Grosseteste concludes that light is indeed the first form (see
Panti 2012).</p>

<p>
Based on this theory, Grosseteste developed a cosmogony and cosmology.
According to him, God created the first form (i.e., light) in prime
matter, both being indivisible and simple. Grosseteste argues that
finite multiplication of a simple cannot result in an item with size
(<em>quantum</em>). However, he posits that infinite multiplication of
a simple can generate a finite <em>quantum</em>. Consequently, through
the infinite multiplication of the first form in prime matter, the
extended bodies of the physical universe were produced. To accommodate
bodies of different sizes, Grosseteste suggests the existence of
infinities of different sizes (see section 5 below) standing in
various numerical and non-numerical ratios to each other.
Therefore,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
light, by the infinite multiplication of itself, extends matter into
larger and smaller finite dimensions that stand to one another in all
ratios, numerical and non-numerical. (Lewis 2013: 241&ndash;242)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Grosseteste utilizes the concept of light to explain the genesis of
the Aristotelian cosmos&mdash;a system of nested celestial spheres
surrounding the four sublunary or elemental spheres. The infinite
self-multiplication of the initial point of light extended prime
matter into a spherical form, as light inherently diffuses itself
spherically. The outermost parts of the matter in the generated sphere
are maximally extended and rarefied, forming the outermost sphere,
known as the firmament.</p>

<p>
Because light is essentially self-multiplicative, the light in this
outermost sphere continued to multiply itself, now inwards toward the
center from all parts of the outermost sphere, having diffused outward
as far as possible. As light, being a substantial form, cannot exist
apart from matter, this inwardly directed light brought with it what
Grosseteste calls the spirituality of the matter of the outermost
sphere, the <em>lumen</em>, a body comprising light and the
spirituality of this matter, which proceeded inwards.</p>

<p>
Moving inwards, <em>lumen</em> concentrated the matter below the
outermost sphere, leaving a second sphere below it, comprised of a
matter whose parts are as rarefied as possible. This sphere in turn
generated <em>lumen</em> which, moving inwards, further concentrated
the matter below it and rarefied the outermost parts of this matter to
produce the third sphere. This process repeats, generating the nine
celestial spheres. Each sphere is composed of the matter whose parts
were incapable of further rarefaction.</p>

<p>
The lowest celestial sphere, the lunar sphere, also generated
<em>lumen</em>, which moved inwards and further concentrated the
matter below this sphere. However, as this <em>lumen</em> lacked
sufficient power to fully disperse the outermost parts of the matter
below the lunar sphere, it resulted in a sphere comprised of
incompletely dispersed matter&mdash;the sphere of fire. Following the
same process, the production of the three subsequent mundane spheres
(the spheres of air, water, and earth) ensued.</p>

<p>
Due to the incomplete dispersion of matter in these four elemental
spheres, they retained the capacity for concentration and dispersion.
This characteristic distinguishes the elemental spheres from their
celestial counterparts, making them susceptible to alteration, growth,
and generation and corruption.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste also incorporates this theory of light into his
explanation of the nature of heavenly movements. He posits that
heavenly bodies are perfect because the <em>lumen</em> within them is
incapable of rarefaction or condensation and, accordingly, they can
only move circularly. As a result, it cannot influence the parts of
their matter to incline upward (for rarefaction) or downward (for
condensation). In contrast, the elements can be rarefied and
condensed, allowing them to incline the <em>lumen</em> within
themselves away from the center of the universe for rarefaction or
toward the center for condensation. This explains their natural
capacity to move upward and downward.</p>

<p>
Although the metaphysics of light deviates fundamentally from
Aristotelian principles, Grosseteste evidently sought to employ it as
an explanatory framework for various features of the Aristotelian
cosmos&mdash;such as the nested spheres and the distinction between
the movement of celestial and sublunary bodies. In his commentary on
the <em>Physics</em>, Grosseteste interprets fundamental ideas in
Aristotle&rsquo;s natural philosophy through the lens of the
metaphysics of light. He explains Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of potency
by emphasizing the replicability of form, claiming that every bodily
species comes into existence through &ldquo;the greater or lesser
replication of the simple first bodily form&rdquo;, which is light
(Dales 1963a: 17).</p>

<p>
Similarly, Grosseteste interprets the three Aristotelian principles of
nature&mdash;matter, form, and privation&mdash;as prime matter, the
first form/light, and the impurity of light in things, respectively.
In <em>On Bodily Movement and Light</em>, he equates nature, conceived
by Aristotle as an internal source of movement and rest, with the
first form/light. This first form, acting as a &ldquo;multiplicative
force&rdquo;, becomes the catalyst for various types of bodily changes
(see Polloni 2021b).</p>

<h2 id="InfConMea">5. Infinity, Continuity, and Measurement</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste, likely the first in the Latin West to propose a doctrine
of unequal infinities, asserts in <em>On Light</em> that there are
infinite numbers that differ in size (see Lewis 2013: 241). According
to him, infinite numbers can stand to one another not only in every
numerical ratio but also in every non-numerical ratio (Grosseteste has
in mind the ratio of the infinite numbers of points contained in
incommensurable lines). He believes that lines and other continua
<em>contain</em> various-sized infinities of dimensionless, simple
points or indivisibles and they are <em>parts</em> of lines: for him,
continua are made of indivisibles. Grosseteste acknowledges that
Aristotle seems to reject this view and hold that magnitudes only have
magnitudes as their parts, but he claims in <em>On Light</em> that the
term &ldquo;part&rdquo; has a range of meanings depending on which
mathematical relationship of parts to wholes is in question.
Aristotle, he asserts, means by &ldquo;part&rdquo; in connection with
continua and <em>aliquot</em> part and is concerned only to deny
that continua are composed of indivisibles as <em>aliquot</em> parts.
But this denial does not entail that indivisibles are not parts
standing in a different mathematical relationship to the wholes to
which they belong. <em>On Light</em> maintains that a point is a part
of a line in the sense that it is in a line &ldquo;an infinite number
of times, and does not diminish the line when subtracted from it a
finite number of times&rdquo; (Lewis 2013: 242; see Panti 2017b).
Grosseteste says little about the ordering of indivisibles in continua
but mentions without criticism Aristotle&rsquo;s view that
indivisibles in continua must be densely or &ldquo;mediately&rdquo;
ordered, so that between any two is yet another, a view attributed to
him by Albert the Great and Thomas Bradwardine (see Lewis 2005).</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s theory of unequal infinities served as the basis
of a theory of how God measured the world he created. Grosseteste
takes up measurement in his commentary on the <em>Physics</em> (Dales
1963a: 90&ndash;95). He points out that human measurement of time
involves taking some recurring movement&mdash;say, the daily movement
of the heaven&mdash;and stipulating its duration to be a unit of
measurement. In the same way, the magnitude of a body is taken as a
unit of the measurement of spatial magnitude. Measurement of this
sort, Grosseteste holds, is inherently relative in nature. To say that
an event lasts for a day, for example, is simply to relate its
duration to the duration of the movement of the heavens. Yet God
measures things differently. God&rsquo;s creative activity requires
him to create bodies with a definite magnitude and movements with a
definite duration, and this requires that there be a non-relative
measure intrinsic to magnitudes and durations. According to
Grosseteste, this measure is provided by the different-sized
infinities of indivisibles comprising spatial and temporal magnitudes.
Grosseteste points out in his commentary on the <em>Physics</em> that
were only a single line to exist, it would not be possible for us to
measure its magnitude, and yet God could do so by counting the
infinite number of points that comprise its magnitude. Only God can
measure in this way, for only to him is the infinite finite.</p>

<h2 id="CreEteTimBei">6. Creation, Eternity, Time, and Being</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste staunchly embraced the Christian belief in the temporal
creation of the world and asserted that the world&rsquo;s beginning
could be demonstrated, as suggested by certain arguments in
<em>Hexa&aelig;meron</em> 1.9.7 His most significant contribution to
the medieval debate on the world&rsquo;s origin was his interpretation
and rebuttal of Aristotle&rsquo;s arguments of the eternity of the
world in <em>Physics</em> VIII (see Dales 1986). Grosseteste diverged
on this matter from some of his early thirteenth-century
contemporaries, like Alexander of Hales, who believed Aristotle did
not intend to deny the world&rsquo;s beginning but only that it had a
<em>natural</em> beginning. In the <em>Hexa&aelig;meron</em>,
Grosseteste admonishes those who adopt such an interpretation,
cautioning them &ldquo;not deceive themselves and pointlessly try to
make a Catholic of Aristotle&rdquo; (Dales &amp; Gieben 1982: 61).</p>

<p>
In both his <em>Hexa&aelig;meron</em> and the closely related treatise
<em>On the Finitude of Movement and Time</em>, Grosseteste engages
with Aristotle&rsquo;s arguments for a beginningless world. He
contends that Aristotle&rsquo;s errors stem from a failure to fully
comprehend simple eternity. While Grosseteste acknowledges that
Aristotle and other philosophers successfully demonstrated the
existence of an unchangeable, non-temporal God and possessed some
understanding of simple eternity, their incomplete understanding of
simple eternity meant that they did not really understand what they
proved. According to Grosseteste, this deficiency in understanding can
be attributed to a disordering of their <em>affectus</em> or will,
rather than their <em>aspectus</em> or reason. This distinction,
possibly derived from Augustine, is a distinctive feature of
Grosseteste&rsquo;s philosophy (see Smith 2018). In
Grosseteste&rsquo;s view, genuine understanding demands directing
one&rsquo;s will or desire away from the sensory world towards the
unchanging eternal realm. Aristotle and his contemporaries,
preoccupied with the sensory world, fell short of achieving true
understanding.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste, like Augustine, posits the concept of &lsquo;simple
eternity&rsquo; as the non-temporal mode of existence enjoyed by God.
He argues that Aristotle&rsquo;s claims about the eternity of the
world falter due to a failure to grasp the non-temporal value of the
notions of &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; when applied
to eternity. Grosseteste contends that Aristotle, in two of his
arguments, wrongly assumes that a first movement necessitates a
preceding potency and, therefore, time: for this reason, the first
movement would not be &lsquo;first&rsquo; since time requires movement
and potencies are actualized through movement. Grosseteste refutes
this by asserting that, in the consideration of the first
movement&rsquo;s existence &ldquo;after&rdquo; not existing and its
potency to exist &ldquo;before&rdquo; existing, the notions of
&ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; are to be taken in a
non-temporal sense, within God&rsquo;s eternity and considering that
the actualization of this potency involves no movement or change in
God. Addressing Aristotle&rsquo;s third argument against a first
instant and his claim that an instant is a link between past and
future, Grosseteste argues that this view appeals only to those
already committed to the eternity of time and change.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste argues that comprehending eternity is crucial for
understanding time. In his commentary on the <em>Physics</em>, he
criticizes Aristotle&rsquo;s view of time as a number of change,
deeming it superficial and insufficient for capturing time&rsquo;s
true essence beyond the realm of natural philosophy. Yet Grosseteste
also disagrees with Augustine&rsquo;s subjectivist conception of time
and aims for an objective understanding of the true essence of
time.</p>

<p>
For Grosseteste, time is defined as &ldquo;the privation of the
<em>at-once</em> of eternity from the totality of being&rdquo; (Dales
1963a: 96). This implies that, for time to exist, there must exist
entities whose existence is not instantaneously eternal (the
<em>at-once</em> of eternity). Eternity is like a sort of fixed point
subject to a continuous succession of the adherences of instantaneous
bits of the totality of existence, one bit adhering to eternity only
continuously to be replaced by another. This continuous replacement
constitutes the flow of time. Grosseteste defines the instant (the
&ldquo;now&rdquo;) as the adherence of being to the <em>at-once</em>
of eternity and, accordingly, past and future are also defined in
relation to this adherence. He acknowledges potential circularity in
his tense usage but asks for understanding due to the challenge of
making these concepts understandable (Dales 1963a: 98).</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s concept of time seems intricately connected to his
understanding of existence, as elucidated in his commentaries on the
<em>Posterior Analytics</em> and the <em>Physics</em>, as well as in
<em>On Truth</em> (Rossi 1981: 290&ndash;291; Dales 1963a: 7; Baur
1912: 141; see also Lewis 2009). According to Grosseteste, the
existence of a created thing <em>is</em> its dependence on God.
Grosseteste appears to equate this relation of dependence with the
relation of adherence to the <em>at-once</em> of eternity (see Dales
1963a: 96&ndash;97). However, it is noteworthy that he does not seem
to recognize the distinction between the relata involved in the
relation of adherence in his time theory and the relation of
dependence in his account of existence. In the account of time, it is
an instantaneous bit of a thing&rsquo;s <em>existence</em> that
adheres, while in his account of existence, it is the thing itself
that is dependent, treating existence as a relation rather than the
term of a relation.</p>

<h2 id="DivForHumFre">7. Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s <em>On Free Decision</em> stands as one of his
most significant works, with its first half primarily addressing the
challenge of reconciling God&rsquo;s foreknowledge with human freedom.
While the discussion delves into Grosseteste&rsquo;s noteworthy theory
of modality, its significance also lies in the argument he presents
regarding the incompatibility of God&rsquo;s knowledge of the future
and future contingency. Noticeably, Grosseteste distinguishes his
approach from the perspectives offered by Boethius and Anselm in their
earlier discussions of the same issue.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste presents the argument as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Everything known by God is or was or will be; <em>a</em> is known by
God (let <em>a</em> be a future contingent); so <em>a</em> is or was
or will be. But <em>a</em> neither is nor was; so it will be. Each of
the premises is clearly necessary, as is the inference. So the
conclusion is not just true but also necessary, for only what is
necessary follows from things that are necessary. (Lewis 2017:
111)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A sound argument without modal premises concludes that an event will
occur. Since its premises are necessary, by the principle that
entailment transmits necessity from premises to conclusion, its
conclusion is necessary too. Grosseteste focuses on premises
formulated in terms of God&rsquo;s knowledge, but he clearly thinks
that a range of arguments having the same form can be constructed,
employing in their initial part also premises formulated in terms of
prophecy or even past-tensed truths of the form &ldquo;It was the case
that <em>A</em> will exist&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s reliance on the principle that entailment
transmits necessity from the premises to the conclusions of a valid
inference is a noteworthy aspect of the argument he explores. Despite
the challenges posed in terms of how contingency seems to follow from
necessity, Grosseteste ultimately maintains the validity of the
principle, affirming that syllogistic inference ensures the
transmission of necessity from necessary antecedents to conclusions
(see Lewis 2017: 139). Grosseteste acknowledges the soundness of
arguments proving the necessity of true propositions about future acts
but challenges the inference that such necessity implies a lack of
freedom in those acts. He argues that the type of necessity involved
in such arguments is compatible with freedom. According to
Grosseteste, the incompatibility with freedom arises only with a
different kind of necessity. Arguments relying on this alternative
necessity fail as their premises and conclusions are contingent in the
correlative sense of contingency.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s solution to the conflict between divine
foreknowledge and free decision includes two key points. First, he
claims that there is a distinct family of modal notions in respect of
which future events and true propositions about them may be
contingent. Second, he argues that freedom necessitates only this
particular type of contingency. While he provides limited support for
the latter claim, his introduction of a distinct family of modal
notions is noteworthy and marks a crucial stage in the development of
modal theory.</p>

<h2 id="ModGodPow">8. Modality and God&rsquo;s Power</h2>

<p>
When Grosseteste wrote <em>On Free Decision</em>, modal concepts were
typically understood in terms of the notion of change and,
consequently, time. Grosseteste speaks of a necessary proposition, in
this context, as one that is invariably true and incapable of becoming
false&mdash;its truth cannot <em>cease</em> to be. In turn, a
contingent proposition can change its truth value. A possible
proposition, if false, can become true, while an impossible
proposition is inherently false and cannot become true. Conceptions of
modality along these lines were sometimes described as <em>per
accidens</em> conceptions since, in many cases, a proposition&rsquo;s
modal status could change with the passage of time. Its modal status
happens to or is incidental to it (<em>accidit</em>). For instance,
&ldquo;Caesar crossed the Rubicon&rdquo; was once false and not
necessary but became true and necessary&mdash;incapable of becoming
false&mdash;after Caesar crossed the Rubicon. True propositions about
the past served as standard examples of propositions necessary in the
sense that their truth cannot cease.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste argues that true propositions about the present may well
be contingent on this understanding of contingency, as they can become
false. However, he holds that all true propositions about the future
are necessary. One might question this stance, given instances where a
true proposition about the future becomes false after the predicted
event occurs. Yet, upon closer examination, Grosseteste contends that
true propositions about the future are necessary because they cannot
become false <em>prior</em> to the realization of the anticipated
state of affairs. He has a limited unchangeability of truth in
mind.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste does not reject this conception of <em>per accidens</em>
modalities. Instead, he introduces another family of modal notions
unrelated to considerations of time or change&mdash;an array of
non-temporal modal notions. He argues that many true propositions
about the future, including those about future free acts, fall under
the sense of contingency within this modal family. The latter also
includes true propositions about God&rsquo;s knowledge of those acts,
past prophecies, or statements affirming that it was the case that the
acts would occur. Traces of similar ideas can be found, although
<em>implicitly</em>, in some of his predecessors, like Peter Lombard,
whom Grosseteste cites. However, unlike Grosseteste, they had not
delved into a detailed <em>theory</em> of modality severed from
considerations of time and change (except for Peter Abelard, with some
caveats). Later thinkers like Duns Scotus expanded on the concept of
non-temporal modality with even more detail, sharing elements found in
Grosseteste&rsquo;s account and possibly influenced by it (see Lewis
1996).</p>

<p>
The central idea guiding Grosseteste&rsquo;s approach to a notion of
non-temporal contingency is that even if a proposition, such as
&ldquo;Antichrist will exist&rdquo; (his standard example of a true,
future contingent proposition), is true now and cannot become false
until Antichrist comes into existence, the world might nevertheless
have been such that &ldquo;Antichrist will exist&rdquo; was never
true. A present-day thinker might articulate this idea in terms of
alternative possible worlds, but Grosseteste expresses it in terms of
the notion of a proposition&rsquo;s eternal power or capacity for
truth or falsity without a beginning, grounding such powers ultimately
in God&rsquo;s eternal power to know or will propositions.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s discussion of non-temporal modalities and their
relation to God&rsquo;s power is most fully set out in the earlier
recension of <em>On Free Decision</em>. Focusing on necessity, he
writes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
something is called necessary in that it has no capacity, either not
to be, or not to have been, or not to be going to be. [The dictum]
&ldquo;that two and three are five&rdquo; is necessary in this sense,
because it has no capacity not to be true in the present, or in the
future, or in the past, or ever, be it with or without a beginning.
(Lewis 2017: 39,41)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Grosseteste goes on to describe the corresponding notion of
contingency as a matter of a proposition&rsquo;s having &ldquo;a
capacity for being true and being false without a beginning&rdquo;.
What is necessary in this sense utterly lacks a power to be false.
What is contingent, in the corresponding sense, could have had from
the beginning a different truth-value, though it may well lack a power
to change its truth-value from that which it actually has. Grosseteste
holds that this kind of contingency of propositions about future
events or things implies that the things or events the proposition is
about may themselves be called contingent, and that this kind of
contingency is sufficient for the freedom of our future acts.</p>

<p>
Much of Grosseteste&rsquo;s discussion of modality revolves around
challenges posed by the concept of the eternal power of a proposition
to be true or false without a beginning. He appears to hold such
powers to be possessed not in time but in eternity. Grosseteste
observes that God also possesses eternal powers&mdash;namely, the
ability to know and will without a beginning. The difficulties
associated with the eternal powers of propositions parallel those of
God&rsquo;s eternal powers. In fact, Grosseteste explains the eternal
powers of propositions in terms of God&rsquo;s eternal powers to know
and will propositions and grounds non-temporal modality in God&rsquo;s
powers or lack thereof, particularly in the cases of necessity and
impossibility. For instance, he explains that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the eternal capacity for [the <em>dictum</em>] &ldquo;that Antichrist
was going to exist&rdquo; to have had truth and not to have had truth
without a beginning is nothing but the capacity of God by which God
was able from eternity and without a beginning to will or not to will
that Antichrist will exist, or to know or not to know that Antichrist
will exist. (Lewis 2017: 55)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The difficulties associated with the notion of eternal powers arise
from the idea of unexercised yet genuine eternal powers, which seems
to be a requirement in Grosseteste&rsquo;s account of non-temporal
contingency. When expressed in terms of God&rsquo;s powers to know or
will, a challenge emerges regarding the meaning behind statements that
God <em>could have</em> not known or willed what he presently knows or
wills, as implied by the doctrine that God possesses the power to not
know or not will what he knows or wills. According to Grosseteste, the
phrase &ldquo;could have&rdquo; implies a priority of power to act,
signifying that before God&rsquo;s willing of <em>p</em>, he had the
power not to will that <em>p</em>. However, given that God exists
outside of time, &ldquo;could have&rdquo; cannot express a temporal
priority of God&rsquo;s power over its act. Grosseteste addresses this
issue by proposing that it denotes a <em>causal priority</em>, a
concept he drew from Eriugena (see Lewis 1996).</p>

<p>
The notion of unexercised eternal powers encounters the challenge that
these powers, if genuine, seem to pertain to future acts and could be
exercised in the future. For a timeless being like God, how could he
exercise, at a future time, his power to know or will something he
presently does not know or will? Indeed, these powers are described as
powers to know or will <em>without beginning</em>. This attribution of
power to God appears to be empty (<em>frustra</em>). Grosseteste
grapples with a fundamental problem for those who, like him, posit
that God is timeless yet possesses powers for actions he does not
perform. His solution appeals to the idea that God&rsquo;s powers to
know or will are rational powers, capable of multiple expressions
(drawing from Aristotle&rsquo;s concept of rational power). Therefore,
the power to know that <em>p</em> is identical to the power to
not-know that <em>p</em>. With this understanding, if God knows that
<em>p</em>, his power to not-know that <em>p</em> is <em>ipso
facto</em> exercised, as it corresponds to the same power to know that
<em>p</em>. Consequently, there are no unexercised powers in God.
Thomas Bradwardine critiqued this account, asserting that a more
plausible criterion for exercisability is that if an agent has the
power to know that <em>p</em> and does not know that <em>p</em>, then
he can exercise that power by knowing that <em>p</em>. Grosseteste
does not provide a response to this objection. A possible answer would
require a more thorough examination of the relationship between power,
time, and change than Grosseteste undertakes (see Lewis 1996).</p>

<h2 id="FreDecFreWil">9. Free Decision and Freedom of the Will</h2>

<p>
Accounts of human action and the associated freedom in the early
thirteenth century center around the concept of &ldquo;free
decision&rdquo; (<em>liberum arbitrium</em>). The expression
&ldquo;free decision&rdquo; was understood to encompass not only a
specific type of act, as implied by its grammatical structure as a
concrete term, but also the capacity or capacities engaged in the
exercise of such an act. The term &ldquo;decision&rdquo; typically
implicated reason, while &ldquo;free&rdquo; alluded to the will.
Accordingly, inquiries often arose regarding whether &ldquo;free
decision&rdquo; pertains to an act of reason or will, and whether the
capacities involved in such an act are reason, will, a combination of
both, or conceivably other capacities. Hence, medieval accounts of
free decision offer valuable insights into the authors&rsquo;
understanding of human action and freedom.</p>

<p>
According to Grosseteste&rsquo;s <em>On Free Decision</em>,
&ldquo;free decision&rdquo; in its concrete usage refers to a
decision, a specific type of rational act (on Grosseteste&rsquo;s
theory see Lewis 2013, 2017, and Pickav&eacute; 2017.) This act, like
any other act of reason, is not itself free but is described as free
in a derivative sense because it guides the will, whose acts are
considered free. Reason&rsquo;s role is to differentiate between good
and bad, better and worse, and to suggest to the will what it should
choose or reject. The will, by its nature, makes choices or rejections
based on such guidance from reason but possesses the freedom to
disregard reason&rsquo;s decision and opt for an alternative choice.
This freedom is the reason the decision is termed, in a derivative
sense, a <em>free</em> decision. In presenting this view, Grosseteste
implies that he takes the will&rsquo;s choices as not being
psychologically determined by reason: indeed, reason offers advice,
not necessity.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste posits reason and will as the underlying capacities for
free decision, identifying them with <em>aspectus</em> and
<em>affectus</em> respectively. Influenced, perhaps, by the
Pseudo-Augustinian <em>De spiritu et anima</em>&rsquo;s discussion of
the soul&rsquo;s simplicity, Grosseteste maintains that these
capacities are fundamentally one. However, this unified capacity can
be exercised through a decision in one way and through a choice in
another.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste maintains that the freedom of decision is essentially the
freedom of the will. The nature of this freedom revolves around the
will&rsquo;s capacity to choose alternatives, a concept referred to as
<em>flexibilitas</em> or <em>vertibilitas</em>. This view
distinguishes Grosseteste from many of his contemporaries who reject
the idea that freedom of the will entails the capacity to will
alternatives. Many of his contemporaries understand the pertinent
alternatives to be moral good and evil, and emphasize that some agents
with freedom of the will (God and the angels) simply cannot will moral
evil, whereas others (Satan and his cohorts) cannot will moral good.
Hence, for them the freedom of the will cannot be defined as a
capacity to turn between alternatives. Grosseteste challenges this
assumption by claiming that the alternatives in question are not
necessarily moral good and evil. He proposes that the freedom of the
will involves the capacity to turn between what he calls &ldquo;bare
opposites considered in themselves&rdquo;. Although he provides
minimal details about the notion of &ldquo;bare opposites&rdquo;, it
aligns with his belief, expressed in <em>On Free Decision</em>, that
the moral goodness or evil of an act depends on its relation to
God&rsquo;s will, and acts are morally indifferent when considered
independently of this relationship.</p>

<p>
In Grosseteste&rsquo;s framework, the freedom of the will is the
will&rsquo;s capacity to choose alternatives in the sense of morally
indifferent alternatives. This does not imply that the chosen objects
are considered neither good nor bad. Grosseteste believes that
individuals can only choose what they perceive to be good. However,
the goodness involved in choosing these bare opposites is distinct
from moral goodness: it is <em>natural</em> goodness. Grosseteste
provides limited details about this notion. Yet, given his stance on
the non-determination of the will by reason, he likely believes that
an agent, when choosing among natural goods, can go against
reason&rsquo;s guidance regarding the best or preferred option or
abstain from making a choice aligned with reason&rsquo;s dictate.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste posits that our capacity for moral choice relies on the
ability to choose morally indifferent alternatives. However, he
provides little elaboration on this fundamental aspect. According to
him, humans cannot choose moral good without divine assistance,
although he does not clarify the mechanisms by which divine grace,
combined with the freedom of will, enables moral choice. Perhaps,
Grosseteste envisions God&rsquo;s grace making it possible for
something willed by God, and therefore morally good, to serve as a
reason for human choice. Nevertheless, he emphasizes that the capacity
to choose moral good is not inherent in possessing reason and will
since, otherwise, divine grace would be unnecessary. Similarly, the
capacity to choose moral evil stems from something extrinsic to reason
and will since God, who possesses both, cannot choose moral evil.
Following Augustine, Grosseteste attributes the human capacity for
moral evil to its creation ex nihilo, an inherent and inevitable flaw
in any created being. In individuals confirmed in good, this capacity
remains unexercised by divine grace. As a result, they are incapable
of making evil moral choices.</p>

<p>
Accounts of free will are commonly distinguished between theories
emphasizing the ability to do otherwise and theories centered on
self-determination (see the entry, Free will). Grosseteste&rsquo;s
theory seems to better align with the former category. This alignment
is supported by his arguments for the existence of free decision,
which point to a wide range of phenomena suggesting that an agent
could have chosen differently. However, there are hints of a more
profound self-determination aspect in Grosseteste&rsquo;s account. He
maintains that the will&rsquo;s capacity for opposites is inherently
contained in its power to will and move itself (Lewis 2017: 255),
portraying the will as a self-mover. Unfortunately, Grosseteste leaves
this aspect largely unexplored.</p>

<h2 id="ExeTruIll">10. Exemplarism, Truth, and Illumination</h2>

<h3 id="Exe">10.1 Exemplarism</h3>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s exemplarism (see Lynch 1941), represents an
adaptation of Plato&rsquo;s theory of Ideas within a Christian
framework. In line with medieval thinkers, Grosseteste grapples with
the perceived inconsistency between the existence of an eternal,
self-subsistent realm of Platonic Ideas and the dependence of all
things on God. Despite this tension, he interprets the Platonic Ideas
as eternal models (<em>exempla</em>) and reasons (<em>rationes</em>)
of things in God&rsquo;s mind. These reasons serve as paradigms or
models that created things can either align with or deviate from.
Therefore, the act of creation is akin to a craftsman relying on the
idea in her mind while crafting.</p>

<p>
Given the absolute simplicity of God, Grosseteste ultimately equates
the reasons of things in God&rsquo;s mind with God himself.
Grosseteste moves between speaking of the reasons in God&rsquo;s mind
as exemplars and of God himself as such. In alignment with Augustine,
Grosseteste describes God as the first form, explicitly clarifying
that he employs the term &ldquo;form&rdquo; differently from
Aristotelian hylomorphism (Luard 1861: 4; Mantello &amp; Goering 2010:
38). In <em>On the Halt of Causes</em>, he identifies God with
&ldquo;the form that is both a model and that in virtue of which a
thing is&rdquo; and notes that this form &ldquo;is not conjoined with
a thing but exists on its own, simple and separate&rdquo; (Baur 1912:
125).</p>

<h3 id="Tru">10.2 Truth</h3>

<p>
Grosseteste, writing in a tradition that explored the concept of truth
across various contexts. In his treatise <em>On Truth</em>, he delves
into whether there is just one truth (<em>veritas</em>), which is God,
or many truths (<em>veritates</em>). While discussing this,
Grosseteste emphasizes a cohesive understanding of truth that
encompasses propositions, entities (such as trees or humans), and the
identification of God with truth. The doctrine of eternal exemplar
forms plays an important role in this account.</p>

<p>
According to Grosseteste, truth is the conformity or adequation of
things and speech, specifically the thought expressed by speech. This
conception was relatively new in the Latin West. Grosseteste
interprets it in a peculiar way, identifying the speech in question
with that of God, the eternal Word. In this framework, truth
(<em>veritas</em>) represents the conformity between things and the
eternal Word. Grosseteste posits that the eternal Word is its own
conformity to itself, thus equating it with truth.</p>

<p>
For created things, their truth is their conformity to their eternal
model or reason in the eternal Word. Likewise, the truth of
propositions&mdash;a subclass of things&mdash;is their conformity to
their eternal model or reason in the eternal Word. This, on first
appearance, would appear to clash with the idea that a
proposition&rsquo;s truth is not its conformity to anything in God,
but rather to the state of affairs in the world whose obtaining it
asserts. This appearance, however, is deceptive. A thing&rsquo;s
conformity to its eternal reason (its truth) is its possession of the
being its exemplar specifies. Grosseteste holds that created items
have two kinds of being or perfection. In his commentary on the
<em>Posterior Analytics</em>, he holds that the second perfection of a
thing is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the completion of the activity of the thing to which it has, as such,
been established to be fitted and for the sake of which it has been
established. (Rossi 1981: 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first perfection of a thing is its simply being the kind of thing
it is.</p>

<p>
Consequently, there is a twofold conformity possible of things to
their eternal reasons. On the one hand, the eternal reason of a thing
specifies the very kind of thing that thing is, and simply in virtue
of existing as an item of a determinate kind a thing will necessarily
conform to its exemplar in this respect and be true. Hence, all human
beings and all propositions are true, in this sense, in that they are
the kinds of things they are, this being specified by their exemplar.
A human being is a composite of body and soul, and a proposition is
&ldquo;the statement of one thing about another or one thing from
another&rdquo; (Baur 1912: 143). On the other hand, the eternal reason
specifies the second perfection a thing ought to have but may
nonetheless lack. In this sense a human being will be a false human
being if, for example, she is vicious, falling short of the perfection
of virtue specified in the eternal reason of a human being. Likewise,
a proposition will be a false proposition if it fails to perform the
function of a proposition, this being to state things as they in fact
are in the world. Thus, the ordinary notion of propositional truth,
described by Aristotle as &ldquo;to so be in the thing signified as
speech says&rdquo;, is a matter of a proposition&rsquo;s conformity,
in respect of second being, to its eternal reason, and this is for it
to perform the function perfective of propositions, namely, to be in
conformity to the states of affairs it asserts.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s account of truth aims to accommodate divergent
conceptions prevalent in his day. Addressing whether there is one
truth or many, Grosseteste differs from Anselm and asserts the
existence of many truths (see Noone 2010). Despite this multiplicity,
he contends that &ldquo;there is a single truth that the name
&lsquo;truth&rsquo; everywhere signifies and predicates&rdquo; (Baur
1912: 139). Hence, for Grosseteste any use of the term
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; involves in some way a reference to the supreme
truth, God.</p>

<h3 id="Ill">10.3 Illumination</h3>

<p>
Influenced by Augustine, Grosseteste adopts an illuminationist
perspective on human knowledge. According to this account, human
knowledge is understood by analogy to bodily vision: as a body can
only be seen if light is shed on it and the eyes, so something can
only be known if a spiritual light is shed on it and the mind&rsquo;s
eye. Grosseteste articulates variations of this account in his works,
particularly in <em>On Truth</em> and his <em>Posterior Analytics</em>
commentary.</p>

<p>
In <em>On Truth</em>, Grosseteste presents an illuminationist theory
of knowledge closely following his theory of truth. Because created
truth is a conformity between things and their eternal reasons, we can
only know created truth if we know that a created thing conforms to
its eternal reason in God. Drawing an analogy with a colored body,
which is seen only when external light makes it visible, Grosseteste
argues that to see a created thing as true, an external
light&mdash;emanating from the Supreme Truth, God&mdash;must
illuminate its truth, making it visible. This truth is the adequation
of the thing and its eternal reason in God&rsquo;s mind, which makes
clear why the light of God needs to be shed on both the thing and its
eternal reason if it is to be visible to the human mind. Grosseteste
emphasizes that this process does not necessitate direct awareness or
vision of God, as the pure of heart alone possess such a vision.
Nevertheless, all who know truth must, in some way, have at least an
unwitting cognition of the Supreme Truth and its light, and, in it, a
vision of the eternal reasons.</p>

<p>
<em>On Truth</em> does not explicitly refer to Aristotle&rsquo;s views
on knowledge but instead draws on the ideas of Augustine and Anselm.
However, in his likely earlier <em>Posterior Analytics</em>
commentary, Grosseteste connects an illuminationist conception of
knowledge to Aristotle&rsquo;s explanation of scientific knowledge.
Nevertheless, scholars disagree concerning Grosseteste&rsquo;s
intentions in this regard. Some scholars (Gilson 1926&ndash;7; Lynch
1941; McEvoy 1982) argue that Grosseteste does not incorporate
Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of abstraction, instead favoring an
Augustinian conception of divine illumination. Others (Marrone 1983),
taking <em>On Truth</em> as an earlier work, suggest that
Grosseteste&rsquo;s commentary rejects his previous claims on divine
illumination for human knowledge and associates Grosseteste&rsquo;s
references to illumination with an Aristotelian process of abstraction
as the light that the human soul itself sheds on intelligible things.
However, as Van Dyke (2009) argues, Grosseteste seems to aim at
integrating Aristotle&rsquo;s account of scientific knowledge into a
broader cognitive framework where divine illumination plays a
significant role in all cognition. At the same time, Grosseteste
endorses the account of scientific knowledge and abstraction found in
the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>. (For a more in-depth discussion and
technical aspects of Grosseteste&rsquo;s account of demonstrative
science, see the entry on Medieval Theories of Demonstration, as well
as Crombie 1953; Evans 1983; W. R. Laird 1987; Longeway 2007; McEvoy
1982; Marrone 1983 &amp; 1986; Rossi 1995; Serene 1979; Van Dyke 2009
&amp; 2010; and Wallace 1972.)</p>

<p>
The <em>Posterior Analytics</em> provides an account of scientific
knowledge (<em>scientia</em>). In this context, scientific knowledge
refers not to modern scientific theories based on experimental
testing. Instead, it corresponds to an understanding of why a given
fact obtains (knowledge <em>propter quid</em>), as opposed to
knowledge simply that the fact does obtain (knowledge <em>quia</em>).
Aristotelian science involves systematizing such knowledge adopting
the structure of Euclid&rsquo;s axiomatic geometry and
Aristotle&rsquo;s syllogistic logic.</p>

<p>
<em>Scientia</em> is attained by deriving a fact as the conclusion of
a syllogism with premises meeting strict conditions: they must be
true, immediate, prior, better known than the conclusion, state
causes, be necessary, involve essential connections, be universal,
everlasting, and incorruptible. Such a syllogism is termed a
demonstrative syllogism or demonstration, and it provides explanatory
knowledge of its conclusion. Grosseteste even suggests that only
mathematics strictly comprises demonstrations, but he also hints that
theology might fulfill these criteria more fully, distinguishing the
demonstrative knowledge we can achieve in this life (mathematics) from
that which is possible in the afterlife (theology). The sciences of
natural phenomena, Grosseteste contends, fall short of fully meeting
these criteria. Yet, if we soften the criteria mentioned above, a
demonstrative science for natural phenomena is indeed possible (see
the entry on Medieval Theories of Demonstration for details).</p>

<p>
In Grosseteste&rsquo;s view, the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> does not
aim to provide a method for arriving at demonstrations, but rather to
establish criteria for determining whether a given syllogism qualifies
as a demonstration. While Aristotle discusses the origin of the
principles and definitions employed in demonstrations, it is in
examining these aspects that Grosseteste introduces the concepts of
mental vision and the illumination of the mind.</p>

<p>
According to Aristotle, universal concepts and principles of a science
are derived from sense experience. Consequently, if an individual
lacks a particular sense, their scientific knowledge of the concepts
related to the exercise of that sense will also be lacking. However,
Grosseteste holds that God and intelligences (i.e., the angels)
possess knowledge independent of sensory experiences. Similarly, the
highest part of the human soul, the intellective power, does not rely
on bodily senses in its proper operation. Instead, the latter involves
a mental vision, acquiring knowledge of things by seeing the exemplar
forms or reasons through an irradiation received from God or an
intelligence.</p>

<p>
Grosseteste harmonizes this perspective with Aristotle&rsquo;s
positions by holding that, with rare exceptions, most individuals in
their present life lack this form of knowledge. Their intellective
power is &ldquo;sick&rdquo;, unable to perform its proper operation.
In present life, Aristotelian demonstrative science represents the
highest form of knowledge accessible to most individuals, and it
requires sensory experience.</p>

<p>
The human intellective power is sick due to the darkening and burden
imposed by the corrupt body&mdash;likely a consequence of the Fall.
The operation of the cognitive powers is darkened by bodily
appearances (<em>phantasmata</em>), which obscure mental vision and
prevent the clear perception of intelligible entities. This darkening
of the mind is the origin of all errors. However, in the process of
grasping the principles of demonstration, reason is prompted to
overcome this darkness. Sensory experience, in some way, engages
reason. From birth, repeated sensory experiences stimulate reason,
allowing it to distinguish and discern the features initially blurred
in sensory experiences and formulate universal concepts. The repeated
experience of correlated perceptible phenomena leads the senses to
infer imperceptible relationships among them. This awakening of reason
leads to a questioning of whether these inferred connections are
indeed accurate. Grosseteste illustrates this with an example borrowed
from Avicenna, discussing the assertion that scammony, by itself,
causes the discharge of red bile. Questioning the validity of this
claim, we set up what we may call a &ldquo;controlled
experiment&rdquo; by eliminating other known causes of red bile
discharge and administering scammony to observe the outcomes.
Grosseteste maintains that this process allows us to arrive
&ldquo;from sense at an observational (<em>experimentale</em>)
universal principle&rdquo; (Rossi 1981: 215). Hence, the mind moves
out of the darkness to find a trace of its light. As Grosseteste puts
it in discussing certainty,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is a spiritual light shed on intelligible things and the
mind&rsquo;s eye, and this light is related to the inner eye and
intelligible things in the way the bodily sun is related to bodily
eyes and visible bodily things. (Rossi 1981: 240&ndash;241)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These remarks suggest that Grosseteste sees a role for spiritual light
and vision in scientific knowledge. However, they also indicate his
adherence to an Aristotelian framework where the human mind abstracts
intelligible elements from sensory data. These intelligible items seem
to align with the genera and species of created things, viewed as
immanent universals.</p>

<p>
The kind of vision and illumination that Grosseteste discusses in
relation to scientific knowledge, and particularly in his account of
demonstrative science, is still unclear. Is he employing a notion of
<em>divine</em> illumination in this context, too, as he does in
<em>On Truth</em>? Marrone (1983) suggests that he is not: the light
he mentions is one that the mind itself generates to make objects
intelligible and this theory does not impact Grosseteste&rsquo;s
account of Aristotelian science. Accordingly, the <em>Posterior
Analytics</em> commentary would display a turn away from the
conception of knowledge in <em>On Truth</em> in terms of divine
illumination towards a purely naturalistic conception of knowledge.
This interpretation, however, leans on the assumption that <em>On
Truth</em> was written before the commentary. Moreover, as van Dyke
(2009) emphasizes, this view seems inconsistent with
Grosseteste&rsquo;s analogy between the light in scientific knowledge
and in bodily vision, suggesting that the light in scientific
knowledge is external, emanating from a source beyond the mind, such
as God or an intelligence, to render objects intelligible.</p>

<h2 id="SciMet">11. Scientific Method</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s keen interest in natural philosophy and science
stands as a defining aspect of his intellectual pursuits. He authored
numerous short scientific treatises, delving into specific issues and
problems directly related to the natural world. This interest in the
natural realm also permeates, in various ways, his philosophical and
theological works. Over the past century, scholars have argued that
Grosseteste played a pivotal role in shaping the scientific method. In
particular, Crombie (1955, summarizing his work from 1953),
claimed</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>that Grosseteste was the first in the Latin West to articulate an
experimental method in science (1955: 98);</li>

<li>that he &ldquo;seems to have been the first writer to make
systematic use of a method of experimental verification and
falsification&rdquo; (1955: 107);</li>

<li>that he attributed &ldquo;special importance to mathematics in
attempting to provide scientific explanations of the physical
world&rdquo; (1955: 111).</li>
</ol>

<p>
These claims, however, have sparked considerable debate.</p>

<p>
At first sight, the claim that Grosseteste developed an account of
experimental method in science may be inferred from the passages
describing a controlled experiment to test the effects of scammony on
the discharge of red bile mentioned above
 (<a href="#Ill">&sect;10.3</a>)
 While it is evident that Grosseteste contemplates the idea of a
controlled experiment, the question arises as to whether he integrates
this notion into a broader framework for scientific method in
acquiring the principles of demonstrative science. The evidence
supporting this claim is not robust. The discussion of scammony
remains the sole reference to controlled experiments in his writings.
When Grosseteste revisits this discussion later in the commentary to
explain how we come to acquire experiential principles, the
applicability of the notion of controlled experiment becomes
questionable, for example, in the case of our understanding of the
cause of an eclipse. Additionally, Grosseteste acknowledges that, in
certain instances, knowledge of causal connections can be gained after
a single perception (see Marrone 1986). In summary, while Grosseteste
did utilize the concept of controlled experiments and connected it to
demonstrative science, he did not elevate it to the status of
<em>the</em> method for acquiring such knowledge. Controlled
experiments are viewed as one among various approaches.</p>

<p>
Concerning Grosseteste&rsquo;s actual practice in his scientific
writings, if an experimental method is understood as a controlled
experiment, then it must be noted that Grosseteste does not employ it.
His conclusions are usually drawn from a combination of factors. He
relies on authority and everyday observation (<em>experimentum</em>),
engages in thought experiments, and incorporates certain metaphysical
assumptions, such as the principle that &ldquo;every operation of
nature occurs in the most finite, ordered, shortest and best way
possible for it&rdquo; (Baur 1912: 75). Nowhere does Grosseteste
explicitly outline a controlled experiment as the foundation for his
conclusions (see Eastwood 1968, regarding Grosseteste&rsquo;s works in
optics). It can be acknowledged that Grosseteste refers to empirical
observation as one element among many when assessing the adequacy of
certain accounts of natural phenomena. However, this is far from
employing a method of experimental verification and falsification in
the specific sense of a controlled experiment.</p>

<p>
The assertion that Grosseteste assigned &ldquo;special importance to
mathematics in attempting to provide scientific explanations of the
physical world&rdquo; stands on firmer ground. In the opening of
<em>On Lines, Angles and Figures</em>, Grosseteste underscores the
significance of geometry for our understanding of natural philosophy
(see Baur 1912: 59&ndash;60). Moreover, <em>On the Nature of
Places</em> (a continuation of <em>On Lines, Angles and Figures</em>)
concludes by stating that the natural philosopher can explain natural
causation by the &ldquo;power of geometry&rdquo; (Baur 1912: 65).
Therefore, it is evident that Grosseteste attributed a crucial role to
geometry in explaining natural phenomena.</p>

<p>
This perspective was grounded in Grosseteste&rsquo;s belief that
natural agents exert their influence through the multiplication of
their power or species, a concept that Roger Bacon later developed in
detail. Grosseteste was, of course, thinking of the action of light.
He argues that knowledge <em>propter quid</em> must be through angles,
lines, and figures because a &ldquo;natural agent multiplies its power
from itself to what it acts upon, whether it act upon the senses or
upon matter&rdquo; (Baur 1912: 60). Grosseteste maintains that the
intensity of a natural agent&rsquo;s operation depends on factors such
as its distance from the target, the angle of impact, and the figure
through which it multiplies its operation (either a sphere or a cone).
He establishes rudimentary rules, including the notion that a shorter
distance results in a stronger operation.</p>

<p>
These aspects highlight Grosseteste&rsquo;s profound interest in the
thorough examination of natural phenomena. His mindset, together with
his emphasis on the significance of mathematics, may be considered his
primary contribution to the development of an incipient mathematical
physics in fourteenth-century Oxford.</p>

<h2 id="Inf">12. Influence</h2>

<p>
Grosseteste&rsquo;s influence extended to numerous thinkers,
particularly those active in Oxford. Their number includes Adam of
Wodeham, John Wyclif, Robert Kilwardby, Thomas Bradwardine, Thomas
Buckingham, Thomas of York, Walter Burley, William of Alnwick, William
of Ockham, and others. Leaving aside his commentary on the
<em>Posterior Analytics</em>, Grosseteste&rsquo;s greatest impact as a
philosopher was as a source of new ideas for thinkers flourishing in
the first half of the thirteenth century. Richard Rufus of Cornwall
makes extensive use of Grosseteste&rsquo;s writings in his large
<em>Scriptum</em> on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em> and his
Oxford commentary on the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard, as does
his Oxford contemporary Richard Fishacre in his commentary on the
<em>Sentences</em>. These thinkers drew inspiration from
Grosseteste&rsquo;s <em>On Free Decision</em> and his writings on the
eternity of the world. Rufus also praises Grosseteste&rsquo;s
scientific and mathematical expertise, as does Roger Bacon, a man by
temperament more given to scorn than praise.</p>

<p>
In the fourteenth century, Grosseteste held an uncommon position as an
authoritative figure for Oxford philosophers. Thinkers such as Thomas
Bradwardine and Thomas Buckingham appealed to Grosseteste in support
of their conflicting views on future contingency. John Wyclif likewise
invoked Grosseteste&rsquo;s writings to bolster his views on the
continuum, among other issues. These examples illustrate the high
regard and reverence in which Grosseteste was held in Oxford during
this period.</p>

<p>
In the Continent, Grosseteste&rsquo;s philosophical impact primarily
centered around his expertise as a scholar of Aristotle. His
<em>Posterior Analytics</em> commentary gained recognition and was
widely used throughout the Middle Ages, showcasing his influence in
medieval thought (for its influence in Britain, see Rossi 2012.)
Grosseteste&rsquo;s translation of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em>
also had a meaningful impact. Beside these two crucial works, it is
noteworthy that the fourteenth-century French thinker Nicole Oresme
makes use of various philosophical and scientific treatises authored
by Grosseteste, most notably in his <em>Questiones</em> <em>super
Physicam</em>.</p>
