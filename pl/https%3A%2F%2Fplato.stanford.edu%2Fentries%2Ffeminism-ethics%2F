<h1>Feminist Ethics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon May 27, 2019; substantive revision Fri Aug 22, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
<em>Feminist Ethics</em> aims &ldquo;to understand, criticize, and
correct&rdquo; how gender operates within our moral beliefs and
practices (Lindemann 2005, 11) and our methodological approaches to
ethical theory. More specifically, feminist ethicists aim to
understand, criticize, and correct: (1) the binary view of gender, (2)
the privilege historically available to men, and/or (3) the ways that
views about gender maintain oppressive social orders or practices that
harm others, especially girls and women who historically have been
subordinated, along gendered dimensions including sexuality and
gender-identity. Since oppression often involves ignoring the
perspectives of the marginalized, different approaches to feminist
ethics have in common a commitment to better understand the
experiences of persons oppressed in gendered ways. That commitment
results in a tendency, in feminist ethics, to take into account
empirical information and material actualities.</p>

<p>
Not all feminist ethicists correct all of (1) through (3). Some have
assumed or upheld the gender binary (Wollstonecraft 1792; Firestone
1970). They criticize and aim to correct the privileging of men as the
more morally worthy half of the binary, or argue against the
maintenance of a social order that oppresses others in gendered ways.
More recently, feminist ethicists have commonly criticized the gender
binary itself, arguing that upholding a fixed conception of the world
as constituted only by &ldquo;biological&rdquo; men and women
contributes to the maintenance of oppressive and gendered social
orders, especially when doing so marginalizes those who do not conform
to gender binaries (Butler 1990; Bettcher 2014; Dea 2016a; Briggs and
George 2023). Feminist ethicists who are attentive to the
intersections of multiple aspects of identity including race, class,
and disability, in addition to gender, criticize and correct
assumptions that men <em>simpliciter</em> are historically privileged,
as if privilege distributes equally among all men regardless of how
they are socially situated. They instead focus more on criticizing and
correcting oppressive practices that harm and marginalize others who
live at these intersections in order to account for the distinctive
experiences of individuals whose experiences are not those of members
of culturally dominant groups (Crenshaw 1991; Khader 2013; Cull 2024).
Whatever the focus of feminist ethicists, a widely shared
characteristic of their works is at least some overt attention to
power, privilege, or limited access to social goods. In a broad sense,
then, feminist ethics is fundamentally political (Tong 1993, 160; Hay
2020). This is not necessarily a feature of feminist ethics that
distinguishes it from &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; ethics, however, since
feminist analyses of ethical theory as arising from material and
nonideal contexts suggest that all ethics is political whether its
being so is recognized by the theorist or not.</p>

<p>
Since feminist ethics is not merely a branch of ethics, but is instead
&ldquo;a way of <em>doing</em> ethics&rdquo; (Lindemann 2005, 4),
philosophers engaged in the above tasks can be concerned with any
branch of ethics, including meta-ethics, normative theory, and
practical or applied ethics. The point of feminist ethics is, ideally,
to change ethics for the better by improving ethical theorizing and
offering better approaches to issues including those involving gender.
Feminist ethics is not limited to gendered issues because the insights
of feminist ethics are often applicable to analyses of moral
experiences that share features with gendered issues or that reflect
the intersection of gender with other bases of oppression. Feminist
philosophical endeavors include bringing investigations motivated by
feminist ethics to bear on ethical issues, broadly conceived.</p>

<p>
Feminist ethics is often expressed in morally plural ways, including
pragmatism (Hamington and Bardwell-Jones 2012), transnationalism
(Jagger 2013; Herr 2014; Mclaren 2017; Khader 2018b), nonideal theory
(Mills 2005; Schwartzman 2006; Tessman 2009b; Norlock 2016), and
disability theory (Wendell 1996; Garland-Thomson 2011; Tremain 2015).
Feminist ethics also includes critiques of the work of canonical
theorists as well as extensions of their views by deontologists,
utilitarians, contractarians, and virtue ethicists, who hold some
universal principles or absolute requirements to be basic to their
views.</p>

<h2 id="FemiEthiHistBack">1. Feminist Ethics: Historical Background</h2>

<p>
Feminist ethics as an academic area of study in the field of
philosophy dates to the 1970s, when philosophical journals started
more frequently publishing articles specifically concerned with
feminism and sexism (Korsmeyer 1973; Rosenthal 1973; Jaggar 1974), and
after curricular programs of Women&rsquo;s Studies began to be
established in some universities (Young 1977; Tuana 2011). Readers
interested in themes evident in the fifty years of feminist ethics in
philosophy will find this discussion in section (2) below,
&ldquo;Themes in Feminist Ethics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Prior to 1970, &ldquo;there was no recognized body of feminist
philosophy&rdquo; (Card 2008, 90). Of course, throughout history,
philosophers have attempted to understand the roles that gender may
play in moral life. Yet such philosophers presumably were addressing
male readers, and their accounts of women&rsquo;s moral capacities did
not usually aim to disrupt the subordination of women. Rarely in the
history of philosophy will one find philosophical works that notice
gender in order to criticize and correct men&rsquo;s historical
privileges or to disrupt the social orders and practices that
subordinate groups on gendered dimensions. An understanding that sex
matters to one&rsquo;s ethical theorizing in some way is necessary to,
but not sufficient for, feminist ethics.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers and writers, however, constitute forerunners to
feminist ethics. Representative authors writing in the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries discussed below explicitly
address what they perceive to be moral wrongs resulting from either
oppression on the basis of sex, or metaethical errors on the part of
public intellectuals in believing ideal forms of moral reasoning to be
within the capacities of men and not women. In the
early-to-mid-twentieth century, at the same time that
<em>feminism</em> became a more popularly used term in Europe and the
Americas, more theorists argued influentially for ending unjust
discrimination on the basis of sex. Some authors concertedly argued
that philosophers and theorists erred in their understanding of what
seemed to be gendered differences in ethical and moral reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="SeveEighCentForeFemiEthi">1.1 Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Forerunners of Feminist Ethics</h3>

<p>
In the seventeenth century, some public intellectuals published
treatises arguing that women were as rational as men and should be
afforded the education that would allow them to develop their moral
character. They argued that since females are rational, their unequal
access to learning was immoral and unjustifiable. They explored
meta-ethical questions about the preconditions for morality, including
what sorts of agents can be moral and whether morality is equally
possible for different sexes. For example, in 1694, Mary
Astell&rsquo;s first edition of <em>A Serious Proposal to the Ladies
for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest</em> was
published, advocating for access to education. It was controversial
enough that Astell issued a sequel three years later, <em>A Serious
Proposal, Part II</em>, that challenged &ldquo;those deep background
philosophical and theological assumptions which deny women the
capacity for improvement of the mind&rdquo; (Springborg,
&ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; in Astell 2002, 21). At the time, some
apparently attributed the first <em>Serious Proposal</em> not to
Astell, but to Damaris Cudworth Masham, a one-time companion of John
Locke, since such criticisms of the injustice of women&rsquo;s lot and
the background assumptions maintaining their subordinate situation
were familiar to Masham (Springborg, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; in
Astell 2002, 17). Although Masham sharply disagreed with aspects of
Astell&rsquo;s work, she too would later come to be credited with
&ldquo;explicitly feminist claims,&rdquo; including objections to
&ldquo;the inferior education accorded women&rdquo; (Frankel 1989,
84), especially when such obstacles were due to &ldquo;the ignorance
of men&rdquo; (Masham 1705, 169, quoted in Frankel 1989, 85). Masham
also deplored &ldquo;the double standard of morality imposed on women
and men, especially &hellip; the claim that women&rsquo;s
&lsquo;virtue&rsquo; consists primarily in chastity&rdquo; (Frankel
1989, 85).</p>

<p>
A century later, Mary Wollstonecraft, in her <em>Vindication of the
Rights of Women</em> ([1792] 1988), renewed attention to girls&rsquo;
lack of access to education. Criticizing the philosophical assumptions
underpinning practices that denied girls adequate education,
Wollstonecraft articulated an Enlightenment ideal of the social and
moral rights of women as the equal of men. Wollstonecraft also
broadened her critique of social structures to encompass ethical
theory, especially in resistance to the arguments of influential men
that women&rsquo;s virtues are different from men&rsquo;s and
appropriate to perceived feminine duties. Wollstonecraft asserted:
&ldquo;I here throw down my gauntlet, and deny the existence of sexual
virtues,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;women, I allow, may have different
duties to fulfil; but they are <em>human</em> duties, and the
principles that should regulate the discharge of them &hellip; must be
the same&rdquo; (51). The revolutions of the Enlightenment age
motivated some men as well as women to reconsider inequities in
education at a time when notions of universal human rights were
gaining prominence. As Joan Landes observes,
Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet was an
extraordinary advocate for the rights of women in France during this
period who argued in 1790 for &ldquo;the admission of women to the
rights of citizenship&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s equal humanity
on the grounds of reason and justice&rdquo; (Landes 2016). Like many
theorists of their time and places, including Catherine Macaulay
(Tomaselli 2016), Olympe de Gouges, and Madame de Sta&euml;l (Landes
2016), Wollstonecraft and Condorcet granted that there were material
differences between the sexes, but advanced moral arguments against
ethical double-standards on the basis of universal humanism. Yet the
notion of universal humanism tended to prioritize virtues
traditionally seen as masculine. Wollstonecraft, for example, argued
against perceptions that women lacked men&rsquo;s capacities for
morality, but praised rationality and &ldquo;masculinity&rdquo; as
preconditions for morality (Tong 1993, 44).</p>

<h3 id="NineCentInflIssu">1.2 Nineteenth-Century Influences and Issues</h3>

<p>
In Europe and North America, nineteenth-century moral arguments
coalesced around material issues that would later be appreciated by
feminist ethicists as importantly intersecting. A remarkably diverse
array of activist women and public intellectuals advanced recognizably
feminist arguments for women&rsquo;s moral leadership and greater
freedoms as moral imperatives. The resistance of enslaved women and
the political activism of their descendants, the anti-slavery
organizations of women in Europe and North America, the attention to
inequity in women&rsquo;s access to income, property, sexual freedom,
full citizenship, and enfranchisement, and the rise of Marxist and
Socialist theories contributed to women&rsquo;s participation in
arguments for the reductions of militarism, unfettered capitalism,
domestic violence and the related abuse of drugs and alcohol, among
other concerns.</p>

<p>
Offering the first occurrence of the term <em>feminisme</em> (Offen
1988), the nineteenth century is characterized by a plurality of
approaches to protofeminist ethics, that is, ethical theorizing that
anticipated and created the groundwork for modern feminist concepts.
These include some theories consistent with the universal humanism of
Wollstonecraft and Condorcet and others emphasizing the differences
between the sexes in order to argue for the superiority of feminine
morality. The most well-known of the former in philosophy are John
Stuart Mill&rsquo;s <em>The Subjection of Women</em> (1869 [1987]),
which he credits Harriet Taylor Mill with co-authoring, and Harriet
Taylor Mill&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;The Enfranchisement of Women&rdquo;
(H. T. Mill 1851 [1998]). Like their Enlightenment forerunners, Mill
and Taylor argue that women ought to have equal rights and equal
access to political and social opportunities. As a utilitarian
philosopher, Mill further emphasizes the benefits to society and to
the human species of improving women&rsquo;s lives and social
situations. Mill expresses skepticism about claims that women are
morally superior to men, as well as claims that women have
&ldquo;greater liability to moral bias,&rdquo; emotionality, and poor
judgment in ethical decision-making (1869 [1987], 518 and 519). Mill
and Taylor tend to overemphasize the roles of women who are wives.
Mill&rsquo;s works especially emphasize the benefits to family and
domestic life as reasons to support the liberation of women from
subjugation. Mill and Taylor also posit some differences between men
and women that are controversial today. Despite these views, both
argue for the benefits of women&rsquo;s liberation to scholarly and
political spheres. For example, they describe differences in
achievement and behavior to be the result mainly of women&rsquo;s
social situations and education, making their view consistent with the
arguments of both the Enlightenment scholars noted above, and some,
but not all, of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors
discussed below.</p>

<p>
Attitudes about the reasons for the moral goodness of such
achievements differed. Some early utopian and Socialist movements in
Europe that influenced women&rsquo;s rights activists in America and
would later influence British thinkers, including John Stuart Mill,
lauded feminine virtues and women&rsquo;s importance, but did so in
ways that would reinforce views of women as &ldquo;superior&rdquo;
because of innate qualities of gentleness, love, spirituality, and
sentimentality (Moses 1982). In contrast, other Socialist movements
expressed radical views of the equality of men and women not by
attributing distinctive or greater moral virtues to women, but by
challenging systems of privilege due to sex, race, and class (Taylor
1993). Although Mill and Taylor would later argue that &ldquo;sexual
inequality is an impediment to the cultivation of moral virtue,&rdquo;
some American activists such as Catherine Beecher forwarded a
&ldquo;separate-but-equal&rdquo; vision of men and women as
psychologically and essentially different, a view &ldquo;according to
which female virtue is ultimately better than male virtue&rdquo; (Tong
1993, 36 and 37). In the pivotal year of 1848, Frederick Douglass
insisted that &ldquo;all that distinguishes man as an intelligent and
accountable being, is equally true of woman&rdquo; (quoted in Davis
1981, 51). In the same year, the <em>Declaration of Sentiments</em>
was signed at a women&rsquo;s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New
York, and socialist and anarchist revolutions took place in Europe.
The revolutionaries included public thinkers who advocated communal
property and sexual equality, and who criticized the involvement of
state and church in marriage. Their arguments about practical and
feminist ethics influenced Emma Goldman and other turn-of-the-century
thinkers.</p>

<p>
Philosophical thinkers of different backgrounds generated a plurality
of approaches to the project of understanding, criticizing, and
correcting how gender operates within our moral beliefs and practices.
Some authors offered critiques of unethical domination in the private
sphere (see also the related discussion of historical context in the
entry on
 <a href="../feminism-political/">Feminist Political Philosophy</a>).
 For example, Frances Cobbe draws on Kantian ethics to defend both
women&rsquo;s rights and animal rights, linking domestic violence and
the mistreatment of animals (Cobbe 1864; Scott 2025). The attachment
of other protofeminist thinkers to the positive values of the domestic
sphere shaped their ethical recommendations. Some white and
middle-class activists argued for the end of slavery and, later,
against the subordination of emancipated women of color precisely on
the grounds that they wished to extend the privileges that white and
middle-class women enjoyed in the domestic and private sphere,
maintaining the social order while valorizing domestic feminine
goodness. As Clare Midgley says, &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s role was
discussed in terms of family life. Emancipation would mark the end of
the sexual exploitation of women and of the disruption of family life,
and the creation of a society in which the black woman was able to
occupy her proper station as a Daughter, a Wife, and a Mother&rdquo;
(Midgley 1993, 351).</p>

<p>
In contrast, some former slaves including Anna Julia Cooper and Ida B.
Wells-Barnett, and descendants of slaves including Mary Church
Terrell, grounded their work for women&rsquo;s rights and arguments
for women&rsquo;s moral and sociopolitical equality in rather
different priorities, asserting more interest in equal protection of
the laws, economic liberation, political representation, and in
Wells-Barnett&rsquo;s case, self-defense and the exertion of the right
to bear arms, as necessary to the very survival and liberation of
Black Americans (Giddings 2007). In making these arguments, Black
women laid the foundations for intersectional approaches. In posing
the question &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I a Woman?&rdquo; at an 1851
Women&rsquo;s Rights Convention in Ohio, Sojourner Truth articulated
the exclusion at the heart of the (white) women&rsquo;s movement.
Decades later, Cooper would argue that Black women are
&ldquo;confronted by a both a woman question and a race problem and is
as yet an unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both&rdquo; (1892 [2000:
134]). Cooper rightly criticized white feminists for racist (and
female-supremacist) statements when they were offered as reasons to
work for white women&rsquo;s voting rights rather than Black
men&rsquo;s and advanced a view of virtues and truth as having
masculine and feminine sides. A century before care ethics would
become a strain of academic feminist ethics, Cooper urged that both
masculine reason and feminine sympathy &ldquo;are needed to be worked
into the training of children, in order that our boys may supplement
their virility by tenderness and sensibility, and our girls may round
out their gentleness by strength and self-reliance&rdquo; (Cooper
[1892] 2000, 60; see also the entry on
 <a href="../anna-julia-cooper/">Anna Julia Cooper</a>).
 Her timeless concern for the U.S. was that a nation or a people
&ldquo;will degenerate into mere emotionalism on the one hand, or
bullyism on the other, if dominated by either exclusively&rdquo; (61).
Hers is a normative argument for appreciating the contributions that
both traditionally feminine and masculine values could offer to a
well-balanced ethics.</p>

<p>
Explicitly arguing that standpoints matter to knowledge claims and
moral theorizing, Cooper insisted that historical knowledge necessary
to a nation&rsquo;s self-understanding depends on the representation
of Black Americans&rsquo; voices, and especially the &ldquo;Black
Woman of America&rdquo; (Cooper [1892] 2000, 2; Gines 2015).
Manifesting Cooper&rsquo;s call for representations, Wells-Barnett
determinedly included accounts of girls and women killed by lynching
along with the narratives of murdered men and boys, and challenged the
&ldquo;racial-sexual apologies for lynching to trample the twin myths
of white (female) sexual purity and black (male) sexual
savagery&rdquo; (James 1997, 80). Wells-Barnett&rsquo;s investigative
journalism led her to the blunt suggestion that some of the sexual
relationships giving rise to cover stories of rape as justifications
for lynching were consensual relationships between white women and
Black men, while rapes of Black women and girls, &ldquo;which began in
slavery days, still continues without reproof from church, state or
press&rdquo; (quoted in Sterling 1979, 81).</p>

<h3 id="TwenCentInflIssu">1.3 Twentieth-Century Influences and Issues</h3>

<p>
Like Wells-Barnett, anarchist and socialist writers, some from
working-class backgrounds, advanced frank arguments for differently
understanding women&rsquo;s capacities and desires as sexual beings
with their own moral agency. Leaders included Emma Goldman, whose
anarchism was developed as a response to Marx and Marxism (Fiala
2018). Goldman argued for broader understandings of love, sexuality,
and family, because she believed that traditional social codes of
morality resulted in the corruption of women&rsquo;s sexual
self-understanding (112). Like Wells-Barnett, Goldman coupled
arguments against feminine sexual purity with attention to the sexual
exploitation of, and trafficking in, women who did not enjoy the
state&rsquo;s protection (Goldman 2012). Some suffragists&rsquo;
&ldquo;emphasis on female morality repulsed Goldman. Yet, while she
ridiculed the claim that women were morally superior to men &hellip;
she also emphasized that women should be allowed and encouraged to
express freely their &lsquo;true&rsquo; femininity&rdquo; (Marso 2007,
76).</p>

<p>
Although early twentieth-century protofeminists differed in their
beliefs as to whether men and women were morally different in
character, they generally shared a belief in Progressive ideals of
moral and social improvement if only humankind brought fair and
rational thinking to bear on ethical issues. Progressive-era
pragmatists, including Wells-Barnett, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman, Jane
Addams, and Alice Paul, &ldquo;saw the social environment as
malleable, capable of improvement through human action and philosophic
thought&rdquo; (Whipps and Lake 2016). The beginning of the century
was characterized by remarkably optimistic thinking even on the part
of more radical theorists who appreciated the deep harms of oppressive
social organizations. Most of the Progressive activists and
suffragists of this era never described themselves with the new term,
&ldquo;feminist,&rdquo; but as the immediate forerunners of feminism,
they are described as feminists today.</p>

<p>
Although belief in the possibilities for change seems widely shared,
Progressive-era feminists did not always share common ground regarding
women&rsquo;s moral natures or how to achieve moral progress as a
nation. For example, both Goldman and pro-suffrage Charlotte
Perkins-Gilman argued for individual self-transformation and
self-understanding as keys to women&rsquo;s better moral characters
(Goldman 2012), while maintaining that a person&rsquo;s efforts were
best supported by a less individualistic and more communitarian social
and political framework (Gilman 1966). While Goldman included greater
access to birth control and reproductive choice among the morally
urgent routes to women&rsquo;s individual self-discovery, Gilman and
many feminists argued for women&rsquo;s access to contraception in
ways that reflected increasingly popular policies of eugenics in North
and South America and Europe (Gilman 1932). Eugenics-friendly white
women&rsquo;s contributions of feminist ethical arguments to disrupt
oppressive pronatalism or to avert the measurable costs of parenthood
in sexist societies often took the form of deepening other forms of
marginalization, including those based on race, disability, and class
(Lamp and Cleigh 2011).</p>

<p>
In the U.S., the centrality of sex and gender issues in public ethics
during the Progressive Era moved one magazine to write in 1914 that
&ldquo;The time has come to define feminism; it is no longer possible
to ignore it&rdquo; (Cott 1987, 13). Unfortunately, this sentiment
would decline with the start of World War I and the consequent demise
of optimistic beliefs in the powers of human rationality to bring
about moral progress. Yet throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, as
economic difficulties, military conflicts, and wealth disparity
fluctuated internationally, women&rsquo;s groups and feminist
activists in many countries would advance, with some success, feminist
and moral arguments for workplace, professional, electoral, and
educational access, for the liberalization of contraception, marriage,
and divorce laws, and against militarism. Some of their gains in
greater access to voting, education, and prosperity may have
contributed to the wide audience that was receptive to Simone de
Beauvoir&rsquo;s publications in Europe and, after translations were
available, in North America.</p>

<p>
Beauvoir first self-identified as a feminist in 1972 (Schwarzer 1984,
32), and consistently refused the label of a philosopher despite
having taught courses in philosophy (Card 2003a, 9; see also the entry
on
 <a href="../beauvoir/">Simone de Beauvoir</a>).
 Yet beginning in the 1950s, both her <em>Ethics of Ambiguity</em>
(1947 [1976]) and <em>The Second Sex</em> (1949 [2010]) were widely
read and quickly appreciated as important to feminist ethics (Card
2003a, 1). As works of existentialist morality, they emphasized that
we are not all simply subjects and individual choosers but also
objects shaped by the forces of oppression (Andrew 2003, 37). Like the
protofeminists described above, Beauvoir focused on the embodied
experiences and social situations of women. In these pivotal works,
she advanced the case that embodiment and social situatedness are not
only relevant to human existence, but are the stuff of human
existence, so crucial that philosophy ought not ignore them (Andrew
2003, 34). In <em>The Second Sex</em>, she argued that some men in
philosophy managed the bad-faith project of both ignoring their own
sex-situatedness and yet describing women as the Other and men as the
Self. Because men in philosophy take themselves to be paradigmatically
human and characterize the nature of womankind as different from men,
Beauvoir said that men socially construct woman as the Other.
Famously, Beauvoir said, &ldquo;one is not born, but rather becomes,
woman,&rdquo; that is, one may be born a human female, but &ldquo;the
figure that the human female takes on in society,&rdquo; that of a
&ldquo;woman,&rdquo; results from &ldquo;the mediation of another
[that] can constitute an individual as an Other&rdquo; (Beauvoir 1949
[2010], 329). The embodied human female may be a subject of her own
experiences and perceptions, but &ldquo;being a woman would mean being
an object, the Other&rdquo; (83), that is, the objectified recipient
of the speculations and perceptions of men. A woman&rsquo;s position
is therefore so deeply ambiguous&mdash;one of navigating &ldquo;a
human condition as defined in its relation with the Other&rdquo;
(196)&mdash;that if one is to philosophize about women, &ldquo;it is
indispensable to understand the economic and social structure&rdquo;
in which women aim to be authentic or ethical, necessitating &ldquo;an
existential point of view, taking into account her total
situation&rdquo; (84). In other words, philosophers speculating about
women ought to take into account the obstacles to women&rsquo;s
opportunities for subjecthood and choice that are created by those who
constructed an oppressive situation for women to navigate.</p>

<p>
Beauvoir&rsquo;s positions&mdash;that <em>woman</em> has been defined
by men and in men&rsquo;s terms, that ethical theory must attend to
women&rsquo;s social situation and their capacity to be moral
decision-makers, and that women&rsquo;s oppression impedes their
knowing themselves and changing their situation&mdash;reflect the
concerns of many forerunners of feminist ethics. Beauvoir&rsquo;s work
profoundly shaped the emergence of feminist ethics as a subfield of
philosophy at a time when philosophers more generally had moved away
from the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tendencies to describe
women as lacking morally worthy rational capacities. Instead, by the
middle of the twentieth century, some influential philosophers in
Europe and the Americas had moved toward approaches that often led to
describing both gender and ethics as irrelevant to philosophical
discourse (Garry 2017).</p>

<p>
Feminist ethics did not begin to be established as an academic subject
until the 1960s. But attention to gender-related forms of oppression
continued to be published by important scholars. In the 20th century,
Black women scholars developed a range of conceptual frameworks for
naming what Claudia Jones, in the 1940s, described as the &ldquo;super
exploitation&rdquo; of Black women, referring to the ways that Black
women were oppressed by race and gender in ways that were not merely
additive (1949 [1995]). In the 1960s, Pauli Murray coined the term
&ldquo;Jane Crow&rdquo; to describe the legal standing of Black women
as she fought for the inclusion of sex as a recognized category of
discrimination in Civil Rights legislation (Murray and Eastwood 1965),
while Frances Beal described this location as one of &ldquo;double
jeopardy&rdquo; (1969 [2008]). In the 1970s and 1980s, Black feminists
proposed frameworks that aimed to track multiple forms of oppression.
Deborah King proposed modifying Beal&rsquo;s framework as
&ldquo;multiple jeopardy&rdquo; (1988). The Combahee River Collective
coined the term &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo; as a mode of
organizing around the structural oppressions of multiply oppressed
social groups (Combahee 1982), while Audre Lorde (1984) and Angela
Davis (1981) developed new approaches to theorizing from multiply
oppressed standpoints (see
 <a href="../identity-politics/">Identity Politics</a>).
 These frameworks departed from analyses of race and gender in both
white feminist and black radical contexts, which have tended to treat
race and gender as analogous, but not intersecting, forms of
oppression (Beauvoir 1949 [2010]; Fanon [1952]; Mills 1998). In her
landmark <em>Black Feminist Thought</em> (1990), Patricia Hill Collins
proposed a &ldquo;matrix of domination&rdquo; which posited race,
gender, and class as &ldquo;interlocking systems of oppression.&rdquo;
In 1989, Kimberl&eacute; Crenshaw conceptualized Black women as
located at the &ldquo;intersection&rdquo; of race and gender
discrimination. Intersectional critiques and methodologies have also
been developed within Chicana, Latina, women of color, and decolonial
feminisms (Anzaldua 2021, Lugones 2003, Ortega 2016, Alcoff 2017,
Mohanty 1988; Mohanty 2003; Matsuda 1991, Khader 2018b).</p>

<p>
The establishment of feminist ethics in academic and philosophical
programs did not immediately include high attention to
intersectionality on the part of scholars in the 1960s and 1970s,
however. Instead, issues of gender essentialism revived in the course
of analyzing patriarchy and oppression.</p>

<p>
Some feminists criticized male supremacy without thereby preferring
female supremacy (Frye 1983; Card 1986; Hoagland 1988). They argued
that although the categories of &ldquo;men&rdquo; and
&ldquo;women&rdquo; are physiologically distinct, the potential of
feminism to liberate both men and women from oppressive gendered
social arrangements suggests that men and women do not have different
moralities or separate realities, and that we do not need to
articulate separate capacities for ethics (Jaggar 1974; Davion
1998).</p>

<p>
Other feminist ethicists offer radically different views. Mary Daly,
for example, noted that women were traditionally defined throughout
intellectual history as being subversive of rationality, impartiality,
and morality as traditionally conceived. She argued that women ought
to embrace, as essential to women&rsquo;s natures and good, some of
the very qualities that she said men have ascribed to women as
essential to women&rsquo;s natures and bad; for example, she suggested
valuing women&rsquo;s capacities for childbearing and birth (as
opposed to capacities to engage in war and killing) and women&rsquo;s
emotionality (versus rationality) (Daly 1979).</p>

<p>
Radical feminists and lesbian feminists who disagreed with Daly as to
whether women&rsquo;s moral natures are innately better than
men&rsquo;s agreed with Daly in arguing either for essentialism
(Griffin 1978; cf. Spelman 1988 and Witt 1995) or for women&rsquo;s
separation from men (Card 1988; Hoagland 1988). Some of them argued
that separatism allows a setting in which to create alternative
ethics, rather than merely responding to the male-dominated ethical
theories traditionally discussed in the academy. They also argued that
separatism better fosters women&rsquo;s increased connection to each
other and denies men the access to women that men might expect (Daly
1979; Frye 1983; Hoagland 1988).</p>

<p>
In deep disagreement, philosophers such as Alison Jaggar argued
against separatism as being in any way productive of a different and
morally better world. Jaggar maintained that &ldquo;what we must do
instead is to create a new androgynous culture which incorporates the
best elements of both &hellip;, which values both personal
relationships and efficiency, both emotion and rationality. This
result cannot be achieved through sexual separation&rdquo; (Jaggar
1974, 288).</p>

<h2 id="ThemFemiEthi">2. Themes in feminist ethics</h2>

<p>
In the fifty years that feminist ethics has been a subject of
philosophical scholarship in (initially) Western and (increasingly)
international discourse, theorists have considered metaethical,
theoretical, and practical questions. Concern about feminist methods
of articulating ethical theories can be found in the scholarship of
intersectionality, Black feminist thought and women of color feminism,
transnational feminism, queer theory, disability studies, and
twenty-first century criticisms of feminist ethics. Questions about
the shortcomings of traditional ethical theories, about which virtues
constitute morally good character in contexts of oppression, and about
which kinds of ethical theories will ameliorate gendered oppressions
and evils generate further critical scholarship.</p>

<h3 id="GendBinaEsseSepa">2.1 Gender binarism, essentialism, and transfeminism</h3>

<p>
Gender binarism, which is the view that there are only two
genders&mdash;male and female&mdash;and that everyone is only one of
them (Dea 2016a, 108), was assumed by most feminist ethicists
publishing in philosophy in the 1970s and 1980s in the course of
arguing the moral wrongness of women&rsquo;s oppression (Jaggar 1974;
Daly 1979).</p>

<p>
Influential arguments supporting androgyny, gender bending, and
gender-blending that were prevalent in the 1990s (Butler 1990; Butler
1993), and gender-eliminativist, humanist, and transfeminist
approaches to feminist ethics and social philosophy that are prevalent
in the twenty-first century (Bettcher 2007; LaBrada 2016; Mikkola
2016; Ayala and Vasilyeva 2015; Haslanger 2012), moved more feminist
ethicists to attend to problems of exclusion in assuming gender
binarism.</p>

<p>
One criticism of gender binarism is that its assumption marginalizes
nonconforming individuals. In efforts described as promoting coalition
between trans activists and non-trans feminists, some feminists argue
that we ought to examine the gender privilege inherent in presuming a
binary that reflects one&rsquo;s own experience better than the
experiences of others (Dea 2016a; Bettcher 2014). Yet such
&ldquo;beyond-the-binary&rdquo; approaches, in turn, have been
cautioned against as well-intentioned but, at times, invalidating
trans identities, &ldquo;by invalidating the self-identities of trans
people who do not regard their genitals as wrong&rdquo; or &ldquo;by
representing all trans people as problematically positioned with
regard to the binary&rdquo; (Bettcher 2013; see also Briggs and George
2023). Some argue that recognition of dominant gender norms and their
interconnection with racist and sexist oppression may better defray
the harms of normalizing a gender binary (Bettcher 2013; Bell
2024).</p>

<p>
Arguments for androgynous approaches to ethics or for gender abolition
include perspectives that gender abolition ameliorates the harmful
effects of hierarchical gender constructions (Haslanger 2012).
Arguments against gender abolition suggest that gender abolition comes
with new costs of its own, including the failure to do justice to the
gender identifications of trans people (Cull 2019, Jenkins 2016,
Kapusta 2016), when self-labeling as a particular gender may be a
morally valuable form of agency (Camp and Flores 2024). Gender-norm
authenticity may be liberating and morally important to individuals
(Bell 2024).</p>

<h3 id="EthiCareFemiGendApprMora">2.2 Ethic of care and relational ethics</h3>

<p>
The salience of gendered caregiving roles for ethical reasoning has
been a major focus of feminist ethics. The ethic of care has its roots
in projects that aim to correct for the exclusion of women from
traditional theorizations of moral reasoning. Psychologist Carol
Gilligan&rsquo;s landmark work, <em>In a Different Voice:
Psychological Theory and Women&rsquo;s Development</em> (1982),
disputes accounts of moral development that do not take into account
girls&rsquo; moral experiences (18&ndash;19), or that describe women
as stuck at an interpersonal stage short of full moral development as
in the theories of Lawrence Kohlberg (30). Gilligan argues that
Kohlberg wrongly prioritizes a &ldquo;morality of rights&rdquo; and
independence from others as better than, rather than merely different
from, a &ldquo;morality of responsibility&rdquo; and intimate
relationships with others (19).</p>

<p>
Instead, Gilligan&rsquo;s research suggests that for boys and men,
&ldquo;separation and individuation are critically tied to gender
identity&rdquo; (Gilligan 1982, 8). Some feminist ethicists argue that
the development of masculinity typically involves valuing autonomy,
rights, disconnection from others, and independence, while seeing
other persons and intimate relationships as dangers or obstacles to
pursuing those values; they refer to this perspective as the
&ldquo;perspective of justice&rdquo; (Held 1995; Blum 1988). Women, in
Gilligan&rsquo;s studies, were as likely to express the perspective of
justice as they were to express a perspective that valued intimacy,
responsibility, relationships, and caring for others, while seeing
autonomy as &ldquo;the illusory and dangerous quest&rdquo; (Gilligan
1982, 48), in tension with the values of attachment. This perspective
is known as the perspective of &ldquo;care&rdquo; (Friedman 1991;
Driver 2005). In more recent work, Gilligan has modified the idea that
the perspective of care is a distinctively feminine one, arguing
instead that it is a distinctively &ldquo;human voice,&rdquo; which
challenges what she calls a &ldquo;patriarchal voice&rdquo;
(2023).</p>

<p>
Philosophers who apply Gilligan&rsquo;s empirical results to ethical
theory differ about the role that a care perspective should play in
normative recommendations, as well as about whether care ethics
constitutes its own moral framework, or should be used to augment
traditional moral theories. Nel Noddings&rsquo;s influential work,
<em>Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education</em>
(1984), argues for the moral preferability of a care perspective as
both feminine and, as she later says explicitly, feminist (Noddings
2013, xxiv), orienting moral agents to focus on the needs of those one
cares for in relational contexts rather than on abstract, universal
principles. Noddings&rsquo;s normative theory endorses the moral value
of partiality that justifies prioritizing interpersonal relationships
over more distant connections. Different applications of the
perspective of care endorse care as social and political rather than
limited to interpersonal relationships, and suggest that an ethic of
care provides a route to realizing better societies as well as better
treatment of distant others (Held 1993; Held 2006; Tronto 1993). Some
urge societal shifts to prioritize children&rsquo;s vulnerabilities
and the perspectives of mothers as necessary correctives to moral and
political neglect of policies that would ensure the well-being of
vulnerable people in relationships requiring care (Held 1993; Ruddick
1989; Kittay 1999). This concern is further elaborated in Eva Feder
Kittay&rsquo;s attention to caregivers as &ldquo;secondarily&rdquo; or
&ldquo;derivatively dependent&rdquo; (1999), which has been developed
in engagements with vulnerability (Engster 2019; Fineman and Grear
2016; Mackenzie 2014), need (Miller 2013; Bourgault 2020) and
precarity (Hamington and Flower 2021; Miller 2020). Scholars have
emphasized caring as a normative framework distinguished by a
recognition that we are necessarily interdependent beings with
responsibilities to one another that follow from the fact of our
vulnerability (Engster 2005; Fineman 2005; Kittay 2011). This is often
combined with a recognition that emotions play an important role in
moral reasoning (Slote 2007; Herring 2020; Pulcini 2016), and that
care describes not only the responsibilities we have to one another,
but how we ought to fulfill these responsibilities (Engster 2005).</p>

<p>
In normative theory and applied ethics, care-work and caring in
workplace relationships have come to receive more attention in
twenty-first century philosophy than previously, as appreciation for
the ethical demands of relational support-provision and
client-centered or helping professions come to be influenced by
variations on the ethic of care (Kittay 1999; Feder and Kittay 2002;
Tronto 2005; Lanoix 2010; Reiheld 2015). Sociological work on care
chains (Hochschild 2003 and 2015; Yeates 2004) and care drains (Gheaus
2013, Hochschild 2003) has increasingly informed care ethics (Robinson
2013; Nguyen, Zavoretti, and Tronto 2017; Bourgault and Robinson
2020), leading to greater emphasis on the ways in which care is
organized and distributed through unjust local and global systems of
exploitation (Fraser 2016; Bhandary 2017 and 2019). Particularly since
the 2020 outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, care ethics has emphasized
the structures of caring and domestic labor (Dodds 2022, Htun 2022),
paying particular attention to care chains and structural practices of
outsourcing this labor (Bhandary 2017; Khader 2024; Pascoe and
Stripling 2024). Care ethics has also been important for recognizing
forms of moral injury (Miller et al 2022; Akram 2021; Cahill et al
2023) and moral harm (Dodds 2022, Pascoe and Stripling 2020; Dalmiya
2024; Fine and Tronto 2020) generated in a global pandemic.</p>

<p>
Some feminist ethicists critique the emphasis on care, worrying that
it valorizes a conception of femininity burdened by caring (Card
1996). The complex history of femininity and caregiving practices were
shaped in contexts of oppression that may permit &ldquo;moral
damage&rdquo; to women&rsquo;s agency (Tessman 2005). Approaches that
fail to attend to to wider social institutions and systematic
political injustice run the risk of lacking a feminist vision for
changing systematic and institutional forms of oppression (Hoagland
1990; Bell 1993). Further worries about the ethic of care include
whether unidirectional caring enables the exploitation of caregivers
(Houston 1990; Card 1990; Davion 1993), and whether such caring
excludes moral responsibilities to strangers and individuals we may
affect without meeting interpersonally (Card 1990), thereby risking an
insular ethic that ignores political and material realities (Hoagland
1990). Disability theorists have also argued that caring
overemphasizes the agency of the caregiver at the expense of the
receiver of care, and propose an &ldquo;attendant services&rdquo;
model instead, which emphasizes that assistance is directed by the
disabled person (Herring 2020, 172). Another concern is whether we
risk generalizing care as a priority of all women, disregarding
pluralism and variations of experience (Moody-Adams 1991). Finally,
preoccupation with women&rsquo;s kinder and gentler feelings may
prevent or distract from attention to women&rsquo;s capacities for
harm and injustice, especially the injustices borne of racial and
class privilege (Spelman 1991).</p>

<p>
The above criticisms tend to proceed from a view that it is
problematic that an ethic of care is predicated on seeing femininity
as valuable. However, it remains controversial whether femininity is
an inauthentic or burdened response to oppression, or whether
femininity is a distinctive contribution of moral and valuing agents
to a feminist project that rejects or corrects some of the errors and
excesses of legacies of masculinity (Irigaray 1985; Harding 1987; Tong
1993; Bartky 1990). For example, Patricia Hill Collins argues that an
&lsquo;ethic of caring&rsquo; is needed to undo &lsquo;Eurocentric
masculinist&rsquo; epistemologies by centering Black women&rsquo;s
concrete experiences, emotions, and knowledge claims (1990, p. 765).
Similarly, others note that care ethics shares features with forms of
relational and communitarian ethics from non-Western traditions,
including Africana ethics (Harding 1987; Metz 2013) and Confucianism
(Metz and Miller 2016). In the 21st century, a broader category of
relational ethics, which includes care ethics, has emerged, which
takes moral questions to be located in the relations between entities.
Relational approaches have developed conceptions of relational
autonomy (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000), relational virtue (Luo 2007),
and relational social contract theory (Bhandary 2019). Relational
approaches have been criticized for assuming idealized conditions of
relationality (Khader 2020) by, for example, claiming that relational
autonomy assumes &ldquo;basic equal powers&rdquo; of exercising agency
(Westlund 2018) that may not hold in a non-ideal world. Some Black
feminists have advocated for a framework of the &ldquo;politics of
care,&rdquo; arguing that &ldquo;care does more than require a posture
of mutual respect, responsibility, and obligation between
individuals&rdquo; and propose instead non-ideal theories of care
rooted in liberation struggles which present &ldquo;new possibilities for
living together&rdquo; (Woodley 2021, 891&ndash;2).</p>

<p>
Relational approaches have been particularly important in the
development of feminist bioethics (Jennings 2016; Sherwin and
Stockdale 2017; Stoljar and Mackenzie 2022) (see also the entry on
 <a href="../feminist-bioethics/">Feminist Bioethics</a>),
 gender-affirming and trans youth care (Marvin 2019), and animal
ethics (Gruen 2015). Relational analyses of pregnancy (Rollo 2022,
Miller 2015; Tong 1999; Nelson and Carse 1996) and abortion (Porter
1994; Browne 2016; Herring 2019) have emphasized the complexities of
the mother-fetus dyad, situation pregnancy, abortion, and reproductive
choice in a web of relations, and emphasized the intersubjective
nature of pregnancy (Cahill 2015). In doing so, relational ethics
conceptualize pregnancy as &ldquo;a normal event in the lives of
normal human beings&rdquo; (Feldman 1998, 265) which should inform our
understanding of what it is to be human, rather than an exceptional
circumstance that can be theorized primarily by way of thought
experiments.</p>

<p>
Relational approaches have also reshaped feminist approaches to the
ethics of sex and sexual violation, offering an alternative to
autonomy-based theories (Cahill 2012; see section 2.4.1). Relational
analyses of rape and assault (Herring 2009; Miller 2009) have
broadened analyses of the wrong of rape, situating rape in the context
of genocidal war (Miller 2009, Card 2003b, Enloe 2023), and developing
nuanced accounts of how sexual violation impacts both relational
practices of self-making (Brison 2002; Alcoff 2018) and capacities for
intersubjectivity (Cahill 2001). Feminists have emphasized the
importance of relational thinking in refining and thinking beyond
conceptions of sexual consent, by recognizing non-ideal forms of
consent that reflect relational agency (Kukla 2021) and practices of
care (Isreal 2024; Anderson 2022).</p>

<h3 id="Inte">2.3 Intersectionality</h3>

<p>
Some philosophers resolve the possible tension between conceptions of
women, femininity, and feminism by bringing intersectional approaches
to the question as to whose womanhood or femininity is being
discussed. The insights of philosophers of Black Feminism,
intersectionality, queer theory, critical race theory, disability
studies, and transfeminism, among others, contribute to a view that
there is no universal definition of the category of woman that neatly
applies to all women. Some of these philosophers suggest that the
distinctive moral and valuing experiences of women and individuals of
all genders may be unjustly ignored or denied by a conception of women
or femininity that turns out to be white, ableist, cisgender,
bourgeois, and Western (Crenshaw 1991; Collins 1990; Wendell 1996;
hooks 1992; Tremain 2000; Serano 2007; McKinnon 2014). Black feminists
have long explored the ways that the conception of the
&ldquo;human&rdquo; on which modern conceptions of gender are
constructed are themselves Western, bourgeois, and colonial (Spillers
1987; Wynter 2003). The resulting conceptions of gender tend to take
the social positions of privileged people as generic: as Joy James
argues, &ldquo;the masculinity and femininity in play here are not
racially unmarked (if only for the reason that gender is never
racially unmarked)&rdquo; (2013, 752).</p>

<p>
Minimally, intersectionality is &ldquo;the predominant way of
conceptualizing the relation between systems of oppression which
construct our multiple identities and our social locations in
hierarchies of power and privilege,&rdquo; offering a remedy to
histories of exclusions in feminist theory (Carastathis 2014, 304).
Crenshaw&rsquo;s critique names a persistent problem not only in legal
frameworks but in feminist ethics: a tendency to propose categories
like gender as unified and stand-alone, as a natural or legal kind.
This leads to predictable patterns of exclusion, like the traditional
overlooking of Black women&rsquo;s experiences. For example, when
Black men, but not any women, were permitted to work on a General
Motors factory floor, and white women, but not any Black persons, were
permitted to work in the General Motors secretarial pool, then Black
women were discriminated against as Black women. That is, they were
not permitted to have any job at General Motors due to living at an
intersection of categories of identity that are treated separately in
the law (Crenshaw 1989). Intersectionality centers the lives and
testimony of those whose experiences with living at intersections of
oppressions have been ignored or denied in traditional philosophical
and political theories and offers these experiences as challenges to
the doctrine that discrimination occurs only along one axis of
identity (Crenshaw 1989; Crenshaw 1991; hooks 1984; Dotson 2014; Lorde
1990; Lugones 1987; Lugones 2014). In doing so, it aligns with and
expands on the insights of standpoint epistemology (see the entry on
Feminist Social Epistemology).</p>

<p>
Intersectionality can be understood as both an &ldquo;overarching
knowledge project&rdquo; (Collins 2015) and as an analytic method with
important implications for feminist ethics. Intersectional analyses
are generally united by (1) &ldquo;matrix thinking&rdquo; that
critiques &ldquo;single-axis&rdquo; modes of analysis (Collins 1990;
James 2013; May 2015); (2) &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; analyses grounded
in lived experience, rather than &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; universals
(MacKinnon 2013; Khader 2018b; Alcoff 2017); and (3) systemic analysis
of social inequalities and patterns of oppression (Collins and Bilge
2020; Haslanger 2020; Dembroff 2024). Intersectional analyses hold
that multiple identities or forms of oppression hold simultaneously
and inseparably, such that multiple identities (e.g. one&rsquo;s
gender, race, class) are not merely additive or intensifying, but
integrated into the lived experiences of concrete subjects (Crenshaw
1989; MacKinnon 2013; Carastathis 2013; Haslanger 2020; Martin 2024).
This means that individuals at intersections of traditionally
oppressed identity categories are not &ldquo;necessarily worse off
than the individual facing a single oppression,&rdquo; as if each
dimension on which one can be oppressed is easily separable in
categories traditionally conceived in isolation (Khader 2013, 75).
Instead, intersectional analysis involves working in coalition to
identify both obvious and non-obvious forms of domination (Matsuda
1991, 1189), and recognizes multiple systems of oppression as
operating simultaneously and inseparably. No single-axis mode of
analysis can capture the complex nature of oppressive systems and
their impacts on lived experience across cultural and social contexts
(Carastathis 2013; Alcoff 2020). Thus, &ldquo;intersectional theorists
argue that the oppressions facing multiply oppressed women
co-constitute one another and situate those women such that attempts
to advance the interests of &lsquo;all women&rsquo; may fail to
advance theirs&rdquo; (Khader 2013, 75). This proffers a challenge to
feminist ethics to engage in multidimensional, bottom-up, and
culturally and historically specific modes of analysis, and it
cautions against ethical and epistemic frameworks that are
universalist in key but premised on essentialist, exclusionary, or
ethnocentric conceptions of women or gender (Alcoff 2020; Spelman
1988). For example, Black feminists have consistently argued that
white feminist frameworks that focus on the right to abortion fail to
attend to the broader matrix of reproductive injustices that have
characterized women of colors&rsquo; lives, from forced maternity
during enslavement to eugenics, forced sterilization, the
criminalization of maternity, and family separation and child removal
(Roberts 2017; Ross 2017).</p>

<p>
Critics of intersectionality raise concerns about the clarity of its
terms and approach (Nash 2008; Davis 2000; Collins 2015), worrying
that cultural uptake and institutional legitimation of
intersectionality has limited its rigor and scope, while coming to
dominate fields like Black feminism (Nash 2018). Some critics argue
that intersectionality remains limited by its emphasis on identity and
marginalized subject positions (Nash 2008; Puar 2012). Others worry
that it fragments or undermines the coherence of group-based
identities like <em>woman</em> (Zack 2005; Bailey 2009), which have
been recognized by feminists as important for providing &ldquo;a
standpoint outside liberal individualism&rdquo; from which collective,
institutional, and structural forms of domination can be made apparent
(Young 2017). By fragmenting &ldquo;woman&rdquo; into discrete
categories like &ldquo;Black woman&rdquo;, &ldquo;working class
woman&rdquo;, &ldquo;lesbian third-world woman&rdquo; and so on, the
worry is that intersectionality overemphasizes the distinctive social
locations of discrete subjects, and in doing so, ultimately reinforces
individualism (Zack 2005; Young 2017).</p>

<p>
Some feminists have argued that intersectional analyses might involve
abandoning identity-based categories like <em>woman</em> in favor of
analyses that focus on shared experiences of oppression (Martin 2024),
while others insist that categories like gender remain salient as long
as we recognize them as being necessarily mediated by other dimensions
of identity, like race, sexuality, nationality, class, and so on, such
that the categories like gender change &ldquo;not merely in degree but
in kind&rdquo; (Alcoff 2020). This debate tracks broader
methodological questions about whether feminist ethics ought to aim
towards the deconstruction of gender (Butler 1990; Haslanger 2012;
Martin 2024) or develop more complex, contextual, and decolonial
analytic strategies for conceptualizing concrete conceptions of gender
as mediated by other identities on the ground (Alcoff 2017 and 2020;
Lugones 2007).</p>

<p>
Intersectionality theorists have, for decades, emphasized the
coalitional nature of such group-based identities (Combahee; Lorde
1984; Lugones 1987; Crenshaw 1989; Matsuda 1991; Reagon 2000; Bailey
2009; Carastathis 2014; Sheth 2014; Ru&iacute;z and Dotson 2017),
arguing that coalitions are always constructed as much out of
difference as of similarity (Castarathis 2013). Relatedly, many
feminists have observed that just as some men in the history of
philosophy have falsely universalized from their own experience to
describe the experiences of all humans, some feminists have presumed
false universal categories of women or feminists that elide
differences between women or presume to speak for all women (Grimshaw
1996; Herr 2014; Tremain 2015). Queer, trans, intersectional,
transnational, decolonial, and other women of color feminisms have
consistently challenged the notion that feminism can locate solidarity
in commonality (Khader 2024) or in an essentialist (and exclusionary)
conception of what it is to &ldquo;be a woman&rdquo; (Hay 2020).
Transnational, decolonial, and indigenous feminists have traced the
ways that gender itself is a colonial project, a structure imposed
upon indigenous societies in ways that complicate contemporary
conceptions that gender or patriarchal oppression are universal, or
normative claims that mistake Western or liberal conceptions of
freedom or justice as universal (Lugones 2007; Oyewumi 1997; Nzegwu
2005). In doing so, they name patterns of cultural and colonial racism
within feminist ethics, which have tended to use the lens of
&ldquo;feminist inquiry&rdquo; to find patriarchal oppression wherever
they seek it (Oyewumi 1997; Nzegwu 1999), and to emphasize the role of
non-Western &ldquo;cultures&rdquo; in perpetuating the oppression of
women, often by way of justifying universal or Western cultural norms
(Narayan 1997; Alcoff 2023; Khader 2024).</p>

<p>
By conceptualizing identity as coalitional, intersectionality recasts
shared experiences and identities in ethical terms, posing questions
about solidarity, inclusion, belonging, relationality, duty, and care
in the context of contentious and diverse coalitions (Reagon 2000; May
2015; Ruiz and Dotson 2017). However, there remains debate about
whether intersectional analyses focus primarily on marginalized
identities (Nash 2008) or provide analytic resources for locating all
kinds of subject positions, tracking the ways that dominant identities
like whiteness and masculinity operate as invisible defaults (Carbado
2013). Other scholars emphasize the analysis of how interlocking
systems of oppression interact or overlap, asking how such systems are
to be distinguished or recognized as causally related, rather than
focusing on questions of identity (Davis, 2000; Fraser and Jaeggi
2018; Haslanger 2020 and 2024; Dembroff 2024).</p>

<h3 id="FemiCritExpaTradMoraTheo">2.4 Feminist criticisms and expansions of traditional moral theories</h3>

<p>
If there is a commonality between most of the above feminist
ethicists, it is their interest in provoking reconsideration of
ethical theories that failed either to notice or to care when the
perspective of the philosopher so criticized was taken for either a
generic truth about moral theory or a gender-specific and false
description of human nature. Feminist critiques of traditional ethical
theories include works in deontology, consequentialism, social
contract theory, and virtue ethics. Some feminist ethicists
sympathetically extend canonical work to concerns that male theorists
did not address, while other feminist ethicists resoundingly reject
traditional ethical theories because the theories rely on a conception
of moral agency or moral value with which they disagree.</p>

<h4>2.4.1 Deontology, rights, and duties</h4>

<p>
Deontological approaches to feminist ethics have long grappled with
the tension between the promise of deontological moral theories for
granting equal rights to women and the challenges posed by
Kant&rsquo;s sexism and racism (Kleingeld 1993; Huseyinzadegan 2018;
Varden 2020a; Varden 2020b). Feminists have highlighted both
Kant&rsquo;s explicit exclusion of women from moral and political
equality (Lanoix 2007; Pascoe 2022) as well as the implicit ways that
his construction of rational agents reflects gendered assumptions
developed in his writings on history and anthropology (Okin 1989;
Mendus 2000; Schott 1997; Schroder 1997; Marwah 2013; Sabourin 2021;
Huseyinzadegan and Pascoe 2023). At the same time, feminist Kantians
have consistently recognized the value of Kant&rsquo;s analysis of
sex, marriage, love, self-respect, embodied rights, and domestic labor
for contemporary feminist ethics (O&rsquo;Neill 1989; Herman 1993 and
2021; Nussbaum 1995; Papadaki 2007; Hay 2013; Varden 2020a and 2020b;
Basevich 2022; Pascoe 2019 and 2023; Shorter-Bourhanou 2023). (See
feminist perspectives on
 <a href="../feminism-objectification/">objectification</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Kantian and more broadly deontological moral theories are valuable
resources for feminist ethics because of their recognition of autonomy
and duties of respect and equality. They propose a rights-based
approach to equality, which feminists have recognized as valuable both
for claiming equal rights for women, and for drawing on feminist and
intersectional insights for expanding the range of rights necessary
for robust equality, especially in contexts of political liberalism.
Feminist ethicists have long argued that we should acknowledge
women&rsquo;s equal capacities for moral agency and extend human
rights to them (Astell 1694; Wollstonecraft 1792; Gordon 1997; Mill
1869 [1987]; Nussbaum 1999; Baehr 2004; Stone-Mediatore 2004; Hay
2013). They have argued for rights in the issues of enfranchisement
(Truth [1867] 1995), reproduction (Steinbock 1994), abortion (Thomson
1971; Pascoe 2019), bodily integrity (Varden 2012), women&rsquo;s and
non-heterosexual people&rsquo;s sexuality (Goldman 2012; Cuomo 2007;
Varden 2020b), sexual harassment (Superson 1993), pornography (Easton
1995), violence against women (Dauer and Gomez 2006), rape (MacKinnon
2006), and more. Feminist ethicists have pointed out that rights-based
theories like Kant&rsquo;s may be particularly well-suited to
addressing forms of oppression that can occur within families and
communities, such as those faced by women, those who are LGBTQIA+, and
those with disabilities ( Varden 2020b; Varden 2024), while others
have emphasized the value of Kantian conceptions of self-respect for
motivating both individual and group resistance against systemic
oppressions (Hay 2013; Mills 2018). And, while recognizing limits to
the universality of women&rsquo;s experiences, feminist philosophers
have argued for global human rights as a remedy for gendered
oppression and dehumanization (Cudd 2005; Meyers 2016; Ross 2017).</p>

<p>
Feminist criticisms of duty-centered frameworks, or, deontology,
include those articulated by authors of the ethic of care, who argue
against an ethic of duty, especially Kantian ethics, on several
grounds. First, they claim that it proceeds from absolutist and
universal principles which are unduly prioritized over consideration
of the material contexts informing embodied experiences,
particularities, and relationships. Second, they claim that it
inaccurately separates capacities for rationality from capacities for
emotion, and that it wrongly describes the latter as morally
uninformative or worthless most likely because of their traditional
association with women or femininity (Noddings 1984; Held 1993; Slote
2007). Moreover, an ethic of duty is likely to overly idealize moral
agents&rsquo; capacities for rationality and choice (Tronto 1995;
Tessman 2015). Some feminist ethicists embrace forms of obligation yet
reject Kantian deontology when it denies the possibility of moral
dilemmas (Tessman 2015). Feminists who argue that duties are socially
constructed, rather than a priori, ground the nature of obligations in
the normative practices of the nonideal world (Walker 1998; Walker
2003).</p>

<p>
Feminist ethicists have also explored the value of Kantian and
deontological ethical frameworks for theorizing relational ethics,
care, and care labor (O&rsquo;Neill 1989; Herman 1992; Korsgaard 1996;
Bramer 2010; Miller 2005; Varden 2020a and 2020b). Some feminists
explore the resources in Kant&rsquo;s political philosophy,
particularly his theorization of household relationships including
marriage and parenthood, for grounding a justice-oriented account of
caregiving relationships (Herman 1993; Schapiro 1996; Varden 2020b).
In explicitly developing a justice-oriented account of household
relations and domestic labor, Kant provides critical resources to
contemporary feminist ethics, but feminists disagree about whether his
arguments should be understood as primarily normative (Varden 2020b)
or as sketching non-ideal raced and gendered patterns of domination
(Basevich 2022; Pascoe 2022; Madrid 2025).</p>

<p>
Transnational feminists, scholars of intersectionality, and
postcolonial feminists argue that feminist advocates of global human
rights routinely impose their own cultural expectations and regional
practices upon the women who are purportedly the objects of their
concern (Mohanty 1997; Narayan 1997; Narayan 2002; Silvey 2009; Khader
2018a; Khader 2018b). Critical analyses of some feminist
deontologists&rsquo; concerns include arguments that universal morals,
rights, and duties are not the best bulwark against relativist
condonation of any and all possible treatments of women and
subordinated people (Khader 2018a) and suggest that advocacy of human
rights is perhaps well-intentioned but &ldquo;entangled with
imperialist precommitments in the contemporary West&rdquo; (Khader
2018b, 19).</p>

<p>
Relatedly, some feminist philosophers have criticized absolutism in
ethical theory generally, that is, the prioritization of rigorous
applications of principles to ethical situations regardless of the
particularities of context or the motivations of the individuals
affected, in part because absolutism, like universalism, takes the
absolutists&rsquo; priorities to be rational for all (Noddings 1984;
Baier 1994). Feminist ethicists who have endorsed visions of universal
human rights as liberating for all women have been criticized by other
feminists as engaging in absolutism in ways that may prescribe
solutions for women in different locations and social situations
rather than attending to the perspectives of the women described as
needing such rights (Khader 2018a; Herr 2014).</p>

<h4>2.4.2 Consequentialism and utilitarianism</h4>

<p>
Since John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill argued both for
utilitarianism and against the subjection of women, one could say that
there have been feminists as long as there have been utilitarians. In
<em>The Subjection of Women</em> ([1869] 1987), Mill argues that the
desirable outcome of human moral progress generally is hindered by
women&rsquo;s legal and social subordination. He adds that not only
each woman&rsquo;s, but each man&rsquo;s personal moral character is
directly harmed by the injustice of unequal social arrangements (Okin
2005b). Mill expresses special concern that &ldquo;the object of being
attractive to men had &hellip; become the polar star of feminine
education and formation of character,&rdquo; an immoral
&ldquo;influence over the minds of women&rdquo; (Mill [1869] 1987,
28&ndash;29), as well as an immoral influence on the understandings of
the boys and girls that such women raise. Consistent with the
utilitarian principle that everyone counts equally and no single
person&rsquo;s preferences count more than another&rsquo;s, Mill
argues that men and women are fundamentally equal in their capacities
for higher and lower pleasures and, arguably, in their
responsibilities and interests (Mendus 1994). Harriet Taylor likewise
argues in <em>The Enfranchisement of Women</em> for the moral
improvement of humankind generally and &ldquo;the elevation of
character [and] intellect&rdquo; that would permit each woman and man
to be both morally better and happier, which are overlapping and
important considerations to Taylor (1998, 65).</p>

<p>
Contemporary feminist ethicists who address utilitarianism either
critique Mill&rsquo;s work in particular (Annas 1977; Mendus 1994;
Morales 2005), or defend a feminist version of consequentialism
(Driver 2005; Gardner 2012), or apply consequentialist aims to
feminist issues (Tulloch 2005; Dea 2016b). Some consequentialist
feminists provide reasons for thinking that utilitarianism can
accommodate feminist aims because it is responsive to empirical
information, can accommodate the value of relationships in good lives,
and is appreciative of distinctive vulnerabilities (Driver 2005).</p>

<p>
Critics of utilitarianism include those who specifically resist the
expectation of utilitarian impartiality, insofar as impartiality in
decision-making ignores emotional connections or personal
relationships with particular beings. Feminists have advanced
criticisms of impartiality from the points of view of care ethics
(Noddings 1984; Held 2006; Ruddick 1989), ecofeminist or environmental
ethics (Adams 1990; Donovan 1990; George 1994; Warren 2000), and
analytical social ethics (Baier 1994; Friedman 1994). Impartiality may
yield implausible requirements to value the well-being of all equally
regardless of one&rsquo;s commitments, material circumstances in a
nonideal world, or obligations of caring (Walker 1998; Walker 2003).
Impartiality as a desirable quality of moral agents may overly
idealize moral agency (Tessman 2015) or tacitly presume a biased
perspective in favor of adult, racially privileged, masculine agents
in a formal or public sphere whose decisions are unencumbered by
relationships of unequal power (Kittay 1999).</p>

<p>
Some feminists criticize consequentialism for failing to capture the
qualitatively problematic nature of oppressions that are not reducible
to harms (Frye 1983; Card 1996; Young 2009). For example, Card argues
that even if certain behavior does not produce more harm than good,
its symbolism could violate one&rsquo;s dignity. Her example is the
case of women being barred from Harvard&rsquo;s Lamont Law library
even when helpful male classmates provided them photocopies of course
readings (2002, 104&ndash;105). Card also objects on Rawlsian grounds
that the wrongness of slavery was not the balance of benefits and
harms, contra consequentialism, but the fact that trade-offs could
never justify slavery (2002, 57).</p>

<p>
Anti-imperialist and non-Western feminists argue that Mill&rsquo;s
views in particular purport to be universal but include &ldquo;Western
European biases and instrumental reasoning&rdquo; that establish
&ldquo;problematic rhetorical models for women&rsquo;s rights
arguments&rdquo; (Botting and Kronewitter 2012). For example, Eileen
Botting and Sean Kronewitter argue that <em>The Subjection of
Women</em> contains several examples of primitivist and Orientalist
rhetorical moves, such as associating &ldquo;the barbarism of
patriarchal marriage with Eastern cultures and religions&rdquo; (2012,
471). They also object that Mill offers instrumental arguments for
women&rsquo;s rights, such as favoring the reduction of men&rsquo;s
selfishness and the increase in men&rsquo;s intellectual stimulation
in marriage, as well as doubling mental resources for the higher
service of humanity (2012, 470), suggesting that women&rsquo;s
liberation is secondary to greater purposes.</p>

<h4>2.4.3 Moral contractarianism</h4>

<p>
Some feminist ethicists argue for forms of contractarian ethics, that
is, the view &ldquo;that moral norms derive their normative force from
the idea of contract or mutual agreement&rdquo; (Cudd and Eftekhari
2018). Contractarian ethics permit moral agents to critically assess
the value of any relationship, especially family relationships that
may be oppressive on gendered dimensions (Okin 1989; Hampton 1993;
Sample 2002; Radzik 2005). Other feminist contractarians appreciate
Hobbes&rsquo;s social contract theory for its applicability to women
in positions of vulnerability. For example, Jean Hampton endorses
Hobbes&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;you are under no obligation to make
yourself prey to others&rdquo; (Hampton 1998, 236). Hampton combines
insights of both Kant and Hobbes in her version of feminist
contractarianism, &ldquo;building in the Kantian assumption that all
persons have intrinsic value and thus must have their interests
respected&rdquo; (Superson 2012; see also Richardson 2007).
Contractarianism arguably corrects gross injustices and inequities
traceable to gendered oppressions and the most serious evils that are
socially constructed (Anderson 1999; Hartley and Watson 2010).</p>

<p>
Some feminists argue for the usefulness of contractarian ethics to
evaluate one&rsquo;s adaptive preferences, that is, &ldquo;preferences
formed in unconscious response to oppression&rdquo; (Walsh 2015, 829).
For example, Mary Barbara Walsh argues that social contract theory
models &ldquo;the conditions of autonomous choice, independence and
dialogical reflection,&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;exposes preferences
that fail to meet&rdquo; the conditions of autonomy. Feminist
contractarianism may thereby generate new understandings of social
contracts grounded in appreciation of material conditions,
commitments, and consent (Stark 2007; Welch 2012). Feminist
contractarians whose moral theories are influenced by John
Rawls&rsquo;s political philosophy suggest that his methodology, which
involves reasoning from behind a veil of ignorance to decide which
rules persons are rational to agree to, promotes critical appraisal of
preferences that one would not hold in a better world (Richardson
2007, 414). Feminist critics of Rawls have challenged his assumptions
that the agents that enter into contractarian agreements are
&ldquo;heads of household&rdquo;, thus leaving the gendered and
intergenerational structure of the family intact and unchallenged
(Okin 1989 and 2005a; English 1977) and treating gendered divisions of
labor as outside the scope of justice (Kearns 1983; Okin 2005a).
Feminist contractarians, then, propose treating gender as part of the
veil of ignorance, such that one&rsquo;s gender identity, and thus
place in the gendered division of labor, is amongst the criteria one
does not know (Okin 1989).</p>

<p>
Feminist critics of contractarianism also raise concerns about
adaptive preferences. In the actual, nonideal conditions in which
individuals and groups develop, dominant perspectives and oppressive
social arrangements can make persons come to prefer things that they
would not otherwise prefer, such that the resultant preferences, when
satisfied, are not for the agent&rsquo;s own good, and may even
contribute to her group&rsquo;s oppression (Superson 2012). Feminists
who are concerned that not all moral agents can meaningfully consent
to contracts point to examples of women who are denied access to the
public sphere, the market, education, and information (Held 1987;
Pateman 1988). Others point out that traditionally, social contract
theory has not attended to the inclusion of the needs of children,
disabled community members, or their caregivers (Held 1987; Kittay
1999; Edenberg and Friedman 2013). Feminist critics of
contractarianism tend to argue both for full consideration of needs
born of differences between bodies and social locations, and against
describing gender, embodiment, or dependency as a mere secondary
characteristic irrelevant to what a body in need of care requires to
flourish and thus what a &ldquo;reasonable man&rdquo; would choose
behind a veil of ignorance (Nussbaum 2006; Pateman and Mills
2007).</p>

<h4>2.4.4 Virtue ethics</h4>

<p>
Some feminist ethicists contend that virtue ethics, which focuses on
living a good life or flourishing, offers the best approach to
ensuring that ethical theory correctly represents the conditions
permitting vulnerable bodies to flourish in oppressive contexts.
Although virtue ethics is most notably associated with Aristotle,
whose idealized and masculine agent is not generally considered
paradigmatically feminist (Berges 2015, 3&ndash;4), feminists and
their forerunners have engaged critically for several centuries with
questions about which virtues and qualities of character would promote
a good life in the context of what we now describe as women&rsquo;s
subordination. Philosophers who argue for feminist ethical virtues
raise concerns that sexist oppression presents challenges to the
exercise of virtues on the part of women and gender non-conforming
people. Robin Dillon observes that feminist virtue ethics
&ldquo;identifies problems for character in contexts of domination and
subordination and proposes ways of addressing those problems, and it
identifies problems of unreflective theory and proposes
power-conscious alternatives&rdquo; (2017, 381). Because the history
of traditional virtue ethics is freighted with past characterizations
of virtues as either gendered or as universal but less accessible to
women, Dillon proposes what she calls &ldquo;feminist critical
character ethics&rdquo; as an alternative to feminist virtue ethics
(2017, 380). Advocates of feminist virtue ethics and critical
character ethics consider the relationships of gender to accounts of
character, virtues, vices, and good lives (Baier 1994; Card 1996;
Cuomo 1998; Calhoun 1999; Dillon 2017; Snow 2002; Tessman 2005; Green
and Mews 2011; Berges 2015; Broad 2015; Harvey 2018).</p>

<p>
Like the ethic of care, virtue ethics is often described as offering a
theory that is not beholden to abstract and universal principles
(Groenhout 2014), but instead acknowledges &ldquo;that moral reasoning
might be an extraordinarily complex phenomenon &hellip;, a view on
which what the ethical life requires of us cannot be codified or
reduced to a single principle or set of principles&rdquo; (Moody-Adams
1991, 209&ndash;210). A further commonality between care and virtue
that is of interest to feminists is that &ldquo;virtue theory, like
care ethics, rejects a simplistic dichotomy between reason and
emotion, and does not begin from the assumption that all human beings
are essentially equal&rdquo; (Groenhout 2014, 487). Ethical theories
of virtue or character tend to appreciate the importance of emotions
and interpersonal relationships to a person&rsquo;s moral development.
Some virtue ethics also focus on what opportunities for virtue are
available to agents in particular social contexts, which is useful in
feminist ethics when it comes to delineating our responsibilities as
relational beings and as characters who may exhibit vices resulting
from oppression (Bartky 1990; Potter 2001; Bell 2009; Tessman 2009a;
Slote 2011; Boryczka 2012).</p>

<p>
Indeed, the ethic of care bears so many important similarities to
virtue ethics that some authors have argued that a feminist ethic of
care just is a form or a subset of virtue ethics (Groenhout 1998;
Slote 1998; McLaren 2001; Halwani 2003). Others believe that at a
minimum, care and virtue ethics should inform each other and are
compatible with each other (Benner 1997; Sander-Staudt 2006). Here,
too, however, feminist ethicists disagree. Some contend that lumping
together care and virtue might render the complexity of moral
experiences and available moral responses less understandable rather
than more articulate (Groenhout 2014). Others suggest that this
consolidation might overlook important theoretical distinctions,
including the capacity for virtue ethics to be gender-neutral while
the ethic of care maintains a commitment to embodied, particular, and
gendered experiences (Sander-Staudt 2006).</p>

<p>
Virtue ethics provides wider opportunities for feminist ethics to
attend to virtues such as integrity and courage in oppressive contexts
that the ethic of care tends not to prioritize (Davion 1993;
Sander-Staudt 2006). Resistance itself may be a &ldquo;burdened
virtue,&rdquo; which is Lisa Tessman&rsquo;s term for virtues that
allow moral agents, even ones damaged by oppression, to endure and
resist oppression, permitting a form of nobility that falls short of
<em>eudaimonia</em> (Tessman 2005). Tessman argues that when agents
live under conditions of systemic injustice, their opportunities to
flourish are blocked and their pursuits may even be hopeless. She
suggests that &ldquo;the burdened virtues include all those traits
that make a contribution to human flourishing&mdash;if they succeed in
doing so at all&mdash;only because they enable survival of or
resistance to oppression &hellip;, while in other ways they detract
from their bearer&rsquo;s well-being, in some cases so deeply that
their bearer may be said to lead a wretched life&rdquo; (Tessman 2005,
95). Feminist ethicists have explored virtues that permit the sort of
&ldquo;conditioned flourishing&rdquo; that Tessman describes (2009,
14), extending discussion of the virtues to specific applications in
nonideal circumstances in which vulnerability is fundamental to the
nature of a moral agent (Nussbaum 1986; Card 1996; Walker 2003). For
example, feminists have argued for distinctive virtues in contexts
such as whistleblowing and organizational resistance (DesAutels 2009),
healthcare (Tong 1998), and ecological activism (Cuomo 1998).</p>

<p>
Feminist criticisms of the limits of virtue ethics point to its
emphasis on the personal as potentially problematic when it comes to
&ldquo;accounting for the possibility of social criticism and
resistance on the part of the self who is constituted by the very
social relationships and cultural traditions that would be the target
of her resistance&rdquo; (Friedman 1993). Virtue ethics may also
include intrusive requirements to self-evaluate one&rsquo;s every
feeling or practice to an extent that an ethic of duty, for example,
would not require (Conly 2001). Some care ethicists, most notably Nel
Noddings (1984), argue that virtue ethics can be overly self-regarding
rather than attentive to the point of view of another, and that it
locates moral motivation in rational, abstract, and idealized
conceptions of the good life rather than in the natural well-spring of
moral motivation that is generated by encounters with particular
persons.</p>

<h3 id="RejeAbsoPragTranFemiNoniTheo">2.5 Oppression, sexism, and misogyny</h3>

<p>
As is evident in the foregoing, feminist criticisms of gendered social
orders include the extents to which they are oppressive; that is, they
are defined by exertion of unjust forms of power and control over
groups and their members on the purported basis of their sex or sexual
orientation (Wollstonecraft 1792, Frye 1983, Young 1990, Cudd 2006,
Manne 2018). Unjust bases for justifying oppressive treatment are
often characterized as <em>sexist</em> in twentieth and twenty-first
century feminist ethics, where sexism refers to overly simplistic
beliefs or stereotypes about sexes that create and enforce patterns of
wrongly differential treatment (Frye 1983) or refers generally to the
ideological justification for a gendered social order, including a
patriarchal social order (Manne 2018).</p>

<p>
Relatedly, some feminist ethicists identify <em>misogyny</em> as a
basic moral concern. Whereas oppression tends to refer to forms of
morally wrong treatment and sexism tends to refer to unjust beliefs,
misogyny has been the term for an attitude of hatred or contempt
toward women (Daly 1979, Clack 1999) or a trait of hostile climates
for girls and women in which oppression and sexism exist, and the
expression of that hostile, patriarchal climate, for example in the
form of witting or unwitting punishment of norm violations (Manne
2018), or in the form of culpable evils such as war rape (Card 2014).
Misogynoir is Moya Bailey&rsquo;s term for hostility directed at black
women in particular, especially through cultural images and
representations (Bailey 2013), and the term has been deployed in
feminist moral inquiry on topics including anti-Black police brutality
(Spencer 2018), settler-colonialism (Murdock 2020), and sexual
injustice (Gilson 2022). Transmisogyny, coined by Julia Serano (2007),
refers to the attitude or the expression of ridicule or hostility
toward trans women.</p>
