<p>
Many-valued logics, understood in the broadest sense, are systems of
logic that generalize the two-valued truth-functional basis of
classical logic to any number of truth values. Most of the time, a
many-valued logic will involve more than two truth values, so that
three-or-more is often taken to be constitutive of many-valuedness
(see Gottwald 2001). However, classical logic itself is a
multiple-valued system, and even systems involving fewer than two
values are adequately viewed as limit cases in the broader family of
many-valued logics.</p>

<p>
Classical propositional logic has a simple and elegant compositional
semantics, according to which the connectives can be interpreted in
terms of operations on a two-element algebra, whose universe may be
thought to contain exactly two truth values, &lsquo;True&rsquo; and
&lsquo;False&rsquo;, and affording a straightforward definition of
validity in terms of the preservation of the value &lsquo;True&rsquo;.
Philosophically, many-valued logics arose from doubts concerning the
Principle of Bivalence
 (<a href="#BivaQues">section 1</a>),
 making room for the admission of more values besides True and False,
and creating a variety of finite-valued and infinite-valued systems
 (<a href="#BeyoTwoTrutValu">section 2</a>).
 Technically, the truth-functional character of two-valued logic and
the definition of validity in terms of
&lsquo;truth-preservation&rsquo; have natural generalizations with the
admission of arbitrarily many truth values, as reflected in the
framework of matrix semantics
 (<a href="#MatrSema">section 3</a>).
 The resulting systems, however, typically deviate from classical
logic in terms of the sentences and the inferences they validate.</p>

<p>
This entry starts out with the presentation of some motivations for
many-valuedness
 (<a href="#BivaQues">section 1</a>),
 with a review of some influential systems of finite- and
infinite-valued logics
 (<a href="#BeyoTwoTrutValu">section 2</a>),
 and a presentation of matrix semantics
 (<a href="#MatrSema">section 3</a>).
 It then clarifies several foundational issues regarding the
expressiveness and the truth-functional behavior of many-valued
logics, including a discussion of bivaluations and supervaluations
 (<a href="#AbstCharManyValu">section 4</a>).
 It also considers generalizations of matrix semantics that include
non-deterministic matrices for the connectives, and generalized
notions of validity that go beyond the paradigm of preservation of
designated values
 (<a href="#GeneLogiMatr">section 5</a>).
 While most of this entry is concerned with propositional systems of
logic, we close with a presentation of many-valued semantics for
first-order and modal languages
 (<a href="#ManyValuFirsOrdeModaLogi">section 6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="BivaQues">1. Bivalence in question</h2>

<p>
Many-valued logics are systems originating in a rejection of the
so-called Principle of Bivalence, according to which every sentence
has exactly one of two
 <a href="../truth-values/">truth values</a>,
 either True or False. Around 1910,
 <a href="../lukasiewicz/">Jan &#321;ukasiewicz</a>,
 one of the founding fathers of many-valuedness, questioned both sides
of the principle, namely the Law of Excluded Middle (which he
expressed in sentential form as \(A\vee \neg A\)) and the Law of
Non-Contradiction (which he expressed as \(\neg (A\wedge \neg A)\)).
On the one hand, requiring truth and falsity to be exhaustive seemed
to involve an undesirable rejection of
 <a href="../future-contingents/">future contingents</a>
 (see &#321;ukasiewicz 1922 [1961]); on the other hand, guaranteeing
truth and falsity to be mutually exclusive seemed much less
straightforward than Aristotle had argued (see &#321;ukasiewicz 1910).
Similar doubts about the Principle of Bivalence were expressed around
the same time by Charles Sanders Peirce, on grounds having to do with
vagueness and borderline status, and in a note published much later
Peirce proposed several trivalent tables for negation, conjunction,
and disjunction (see Fisch &amp; Turquette 1966; Lane 1999; and the
entry on
 <a href="../peirce-logic/">Peirce&rsquo;s deductive logic</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The first explicit systems of many-valued logics were published by
&#321;ukasiewicz in a short note on three-valued logic (1920 [1970]),
in which &#321;ukasiewicz offered to use the third value to represent
modal possibility, and then by Emil Post in a paper concerned with
generalizing the property of functional completeness of two-valued
logic to \(n\)-valued logics (1921). Challenges to bivalence had been
raised earlier, however, in particular by Hugh MacColl (1906) in
relation to hypothetical reasoning, by the Russian philosopher Nicolai
Vasiliev in an attempt to imagine non-Aristotelian logics analogous to
non-Euclidean geometries (see papers in Markin &amp; Zaitsev 2017),
and even earlier in the tradition of German idealism (see the
references in Zawirski 1932; Hyde 2008). As it turns out, even Boole
and Frege, two of the champions and creators of modern two-valued
classical logic, acknowledged that some sentences may be other than
True or False, in the same breath in which they endorsed the Principle
of Bivalence: Frege in 1892 by considering that a sentence with
fictional terms lacks a reference and may therefore fail to be True or
False, and Boole in 1847, already in relation to future
contingents.</p>

<p>
Following the seminal works of &#321;ukasiewicz and Post, systematic
investigations into many-valued logics started to bloom in the 1930s.
They were spurred by the problem of axiomatizing
&#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s three-valued logic (Wajsberg, Tarski and
&#321;ukasiewicz), and by the question of whether intuitionistic
logic, also challenging the Law of Excluded Middle, admits a
finite-valued semantics (see G&ouml;del 1932), a problem reiterated
soon after concerning modal logics (see Dugundji 1940). Further
developments addressed a wide range of phenomena, which seemed to call
for an expansion of the domain of classical logic. These included
facts about probability and
 <a href="../logic-conditionals/#SomeTrivLogi">conditionals</a>
 (see &#321;ukasiewicz 1913; Reichenbach 1935; Finetti 1936),
partiality in computation (see Kleene 1938), semantic paradoxes (see
Bochvar 1938; Halld&eacute;n 1949), and quantum logics (see
F&eacute;vrier 1937; Reichenbach 1944). From the 1950s onward,
many-valued logics became a domain of wide investigation, notably with
Rosser and Turquette&rsquo;s treatise (1952) on axiomatic systems for
many-valued logics, followed by much work in algebraic logic, model
theory, and proof theory, developed in different schools around the
world, with an ever-growing number of applications in philosophy and
in the formal semantics of natural language.</p>

<p>
Before presenting systems of many-valued logic, let us briefly examine
three of these applications and the ways in which they call into
question the Principle of Bivalence. Consider semantic antinomies
first, namely sentences such as the Liar, the sentence saying of
itself that it is false. In two-valued logic, the Liar cannot be
assigned a stable value true or false, on pain of contradiction. For
if true, the sentence is what it says, and therefore is false. And if
false, the sentence adequately describes itself as such, and so should
be true. This suggests that the Liar may be <em>neither true nor
false</em>, an option already envisaged by &#321;ukasiewicz (see
Zawirski 1932), and articulated independently by Bochvar (1938),
Halld&eacute;n (1949), and more influentially by Kripke (1975).
Another possibility is for the Liar to be a sentence that is <em>both
true and false</em>, as explored by Asenjo (1966) and by Priest
(1979). The properties of &lsquo;being neither true nor false&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;being both true and false&rsquo; may each be represented by
means of a specific semantic value besides True and False, either in a
three-valued or a four-valued logic. Different accounts of the paradox
will result, depending on the interpretation of the connectives, and
on how validity is defined for inferences. What they have in common is
the fact that both the Liar and its negation are assigned the same
truth value, a possibility foreclosed in bivalent logic.</p>

<p>
A second example is provided by the phenomenon of semantic
presupposition. In ordinary language, the sentences &ldquo;Mary has
stopped smoking&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mary hasn&rsquo;t stopped
smoking&rdquo; both entail that Mary used to smoke. In classical
logic, however, if a sentence \(B\) is entailed by a sentence \(A\)
and by its negation \(\neg A\), then it must be a tautology, as
pointed out by Van Fraassen (1968). But a sentence such as &ldquo;Mary
used to smoke&rdquo; is not a tautology. However, an intuition
pioneered by Frege and Strawson is that the above entailment relation
is based on a presupposition: each sentence can only receive the value
true or false if &ldquo;Mary used to smoke&rdquo; is true. If Mary
never used to smoke, then we feel that both sentences are neither true
nor false: they either lack a truth value altogether, or they should
get a third, &lsquo;indeterminate&rsquo;, value. In compound
sentences, however, presuppositions are sometimes inherited and
sometimes filtered. For instance, &ldquo;if Mary has stopped smoking,
then she can run the marathon&rdquo; presupposes that Mary used to
smoke, but &ldquo;if Mary used to smoke, then she has stopped
smoking&rdquo; cancels that presupposition. The problem of explaining
how presuppositions are inherited by compound sentences is called the
&lsquo;projection problem&rsquo;, and three-valued logics offer a
natural framework to deal with it (see Peters 1979; Beaver &amp;
Krahmer 2001; George 2014; Spector forthcoming).</p>

<p>
A third example, finally, concerns the semantic treatment of vague
sentences. These are sentences like &ldquo;John is old&rdquo;, where
&lsquo;old&rsquo; is a predicate whose truth conditions do not specify
a precise limit of application (unlike &lsquo;90 years old&rsquo;).
Vague predicates often come with a tolerance intuition, in this case
that &ldquo;if a person is old, then a person born a nanosecond later
is old&rdquo;. In classical logic, however, this principle gives rise
to the
 <a href="../sorites-paradox/">sorites paradox</a>:
 given a series of individuals lined up from a person aged 90 to a
newborn, such that the birth of consecutive individuals differs by a
nanosecond, the tolerance principle will imply that a newborn is old,
assuming the individual aged 90 is old. The paradox can be blocked,
however, if one assumes a range of ages for which &lsquo;old&rsquo;
comes out as neither determinately true, nor determinately false, but
as <em>borderline true</em>, as in various three-valued accounts (see
Tye 1994; Field 2008; Cobreros et al. 2015), or if one assumes a range
of intermediate degrees of truth between perfectly true and perfectly
false, as in fuzzy logics (see Zadeh 1975; Smith 2008).</p>

<p>
The lesson from these examples is that incorporating more truth values
than just True and False makes available a richer texture, which
allows for a more fine-grained account of inference than what
classical logic gives us. Many-valued logics offer several degrees of
freedom in that regard, depending on the number of truth values
available, the way in which they are ordered, the satisfaction clauses
used for the connectives, and then how validity is defined. The next
section presents these various parameters in detail.</p>

<h2 id="BeyoTwoTrutValu">2. Beyond two truth values</h2>

<p>
Many-valued logics come in many different shapes that depend on the
choice of logical connectives, the semantics of these connectives, and
the definition of validity. While many-valued logics can be
investigated from different angles, including
 <a href="../proof-theory/">proof systems</a>
 and
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/#KripBethSemaForIntuLogi">relational (Kripke) semantics</a>,
 in this article we view them primarily through the lens of algebraic
semantics in order to put their many-valued character on clear
display. This unavoidably leads to overlap with the entry on
 <a href="../logic-algebraic-propositional/">algebraic propositional logic</a>,
 where the reader will find some of the technical details which we
merely gloss over below. The current entry, however, shall focus (with
some exceptions) on logics defined by means of a single algebra of
truth values.</p>

<p>
A fully general treatment of many-valued logics requires the
introduction of so-called logical matrices, which we postpone until
the next section. Nonetheless, one can often make do with ordinary
algebras instead of logical matrices, as we shall in this section.
Using
 <a href="../logic-propositional/">classical propositional logic</a>
 as a point of reference
 (<a href="#Clas2ValuLogi">section 2.1</a>),
 the aim of this section is to introduce some simple but well-known
examples many-valued logics: three-valued and four-valued logics to
begin with
 (<a href="#TwoThreTrutValuGapsGlut">section 2.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#TrueFalsNeitBoth">section 2.3</a>,
 respectively), followed by infinite-valued logics
 (<a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>).
 This will supply the reader with a stock of examples to keep in mind
when reading the remainder of this entry. These examples are then used
to illustrate a discussion of the inferential behavior of logical
connectives in many-valued logics
 (<a href="#InfeBehaLogiConn">section 2.5</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="Clas2ValuLogi">2.1 Classical two-valued logic</h3>

<p>
We shall view logics as consequence relations determining which sets
of sentences follow from others. Before defining a logic, one
therefore has to choose a set of sentences. The easy part of this task
is to pick an infinite set \(At\) of <em>propositional variables</em>.
The more interesting part is to choose a stock of primitive
<em>logical connectives</em> together with their arities: this is
called a <em>propositional signature</em>. We assume that these
arities are finite and allow for nullary connectives, also called
<em>truth constants</em>. In this section we shall for the most part
restrict ourselves to the signature consisting of the binary
connectives \(\wedge\) and \(\vee\) (conjunction and disjunction), the
unary connective \(\neg\) (negation), and the truth constants \(\top\)
(top, or <em lang="la">verum</em>) and \(\bot\) (bottom, or <em lang="la">falsum</em>),
sometimes also adding a binary connective
\(\rightarrow\) (implication). The set of <em>sentences</em> in a
given propositional signature, also called <em>formulas</em>, is then
the smallest set \(Fm\) that contains \(At\) and that is closed under
the chosen logical connectives (in particular, it contains all truth
constants). For example, if \(p\) and \(q\) are propositional
variables, then \((p \vee \neg q) \wedge \top\) is a sentence in the
above signature.</p>

<p>
A <em>semantics</em> fixes a set of truth values \(V\) and provides a
mechanism that extends every assignment \(\mathsf{a}\colon \At\to V\)
of truth values to propositional variables (an <em>atomic truth
assignment</em>) to an assignment \(v\colon \Fm\to V\) of truth values
to arbitrary sentences. The simplest way to achieve this is to equip
the set of truth values \(V\) with the structure of an
<em>algebra</em> \(\mathbf{V}\) in the given signature. That is, each
connective \(\copyright\) of arity \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) in the
signature is interpreted by an \(n\)-ary function
\(\copyright^{\mathbf{V}}\colon V^{n} \to V\), and in particular each
truth constant is interpreted by an element of \(V\). A
<em>valuation</em> on this algebra \(\mathbf{V}\) is then a mapping
\(v\colon \Fm\to V\) such that, for every connective \(\copyright\) of
arity \(n\),</p> 
\[
    v(\copyright(\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n)) =
\copyright^{\mathbf{V}}(v(\varphi_1),\dots,v(\varphi_n)).
\]

<p>
This condition determines the truth value of any sentence given the
truth values of simpler sentences, and ultimately of propositional
variables and truth constants. Each atomic truth assignment extends to
a unique valuation in this way.</p>

<p>
In the case of classical logic, we only have two truth values: True
and False. It will be convenient here to identify these with the
numbers 1 and 0, respectively. This is a very useful convention, since
it allows us to make use of familiar arithmetic operations when
defining logical connectives. However, the reader should keep it mind
that ultimately this is a mere convention. One may equally well use
the labels \(\mathsf{t}\) and \(\mathsf{f}\) for these truth values,
for example.</p>

<p>
These two truth values can be equipped with the structure of an
algebra \(\mathbf{B_2}\) (the <em>two-element Boolean algebra</em>) by
interpreting the truth constants \(\top\) and \(\bot\) by the elements
1 and 0, respectively, and by interpreting the remaining connectives
as follows:</p>

That is, \(\wedge^{\mathbf{B_2}}\) is the minimum of the two values,
\(\vee^{\mathbf{B_2}}\) is the maximum, and \(\neg^{\mathbf{B_2}} x =
1 - x\). (Sometimes the truth constants \(\top\) and \(\bot\) are not
included in the signature of Boolean algebras. This does not make much
of a difference for our present purposes.) These <em>truth tables</em>
tell us how to extend an atomic truth assignment \(\mathsf{a}\colon
\At\to \{ 0, 1 \}\) to a <em>classical valuation</em> \(v\colon \Fm\to
\{ 0, 1 \}\), i.e., to a valuation on the algebra \(\mathbf{B_2}\).
More explicitly, \(v\) is the unique extension of \(\mathsf{a}\) such
that for all sentences \(\varphi\) and \(\psi\)</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
  v(\varphi \wedge \psi) &amp; = \min(v(\varphi), v(\psi)), \\ 
v(\varphi \vee \psi) &amp; = \max(v(\varphi), v(\psi)), \\ 
v(\neg \varphi) &amp; = 1 - v(\varphi), \\
  v(\top) &amp; = 1, \\
  v(\bot) &amp; = 0.
\end{align*}\]

<p>
A sentence \(\varphi\) is said to be <em>true</em> in a classical
valuation \(v\) if \(v(\varphi) = 1\) and <em>false</em> if
\(v(\varphi) = 0\).</p>

<p>
It remains to introduce the consequence relation of classical logic.
There is a design choice to be made here between the
<em>single-conclusion</em> and the <em>multiple-conclusion</em>
frameworks, also called <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> and <span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
frameworks (see Shoesmith &amp; Smiley 1978
for an in-depth treatment of the latter framework). The former kind of
consequence relation has the form \(\Pi \vdash\varphi\), where \(\Pi\)
is a set of sentences and \(\varphi\) is a single sentence, while the
latter kind has the form \(\Pi \vdash\Sigma\), where \(\Sigma\) is a
set of sentences. We shall state our definitions in the framework of
<span class="sc">Set-Set</span> consequence relations here, but the
reader who is more familiar with <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
consequence relations may easily restrict to the case where \(\Sigma\)
is a singleton, thus obtaining the corresponding <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
consequence relations. This design choice
does not necessarily reflect what is most common throughout the
literature; the reader should keep in mind that many of the logics
introduced here as <span class="sc">Set-Set</span> consequence
relations, such as fuzzy and substructural logics, are in fact more
commonly studied as <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> consequence
relations.</p>

<p>
The consequence relation of classical logic can be defined in a number
of equivalent ways. (We will see in the next section that these
definitions will in general yield different consequence relations as
soon as one leaves the two-valued setting.) The most common definition
is the <em>preservation of truth</em> from the premise set to the
conclusion set. This definition states that a set of sentences
\(\Sigma\) is a consequence of a set of sentences \(\Pi\) in classical
logic, in symbols \(\Pi \vdash_{\textrm{CL}} \Sigma\), in the
following case:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(v(\varphi) = 1\) for all \(\varphi \in \Pi\) implies \(v(\psi) = 1\)
for some \(\psi \in \Sigma,\) for every classical valuation \(v\).</p>
</div>

<p>
That is, if all the sentences in the premise set are true in a
valuation, then so is some sentence in the conclusion set. (Stated
contrapositively: if all the sentences in the conclusion set fail to
be true in a valuation, then so does some sentence in the premise
set.) Equivalently, the same relation can be described by the
<em>backward preservation of falsity</em>, namely:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(v(\psi) = 0\) for all \(\psi \in \Sigma\) implies \(v(\varphi) = 0\)
for some \(\varphi \in \Pi,\) for every classical valuation \(v\).</p>
</div>

<p>
That is, if all the sentences in the premise set are non-false in a
valuation, then so is some sentence in the conclusion set. (Stated
contrapositively: if all the sentences in the conclusion set are false
in a valuation, then so is some sentence in the premise set.) Finally,
we can also use the fact that the two truth values of classical logic
come with a natural order: \(0 \lt 1\). The above conditions are then
equivalent to</p> 
\[
  \min \{ v(\varphi) \mid \varphi \in \Pi \} \leq \max \{ v(\psi) \mid
\psi \in \Sigma \}.
\]

<p>
That is, the greatest truth value among the sentences in the
conclusion set is at least as high as the least truth value among the
sentences in the premise set. Whichever definition we choose, the
consequence relation \(\vdash_{\CL}\) ends up being <em>finitary</em>:
if \(\Pi \vdash_{\CL} \Sigma\), then there are finite sets \(\Pi'
\subseteq \Pi\) and \(\Sigma' \subseteq \Sigma\) such that \(\Pi'
\vdash_{\CL} \Sigma'\).</p>

<p>
Two special cases of classical consequence are important enough to
merit their own terminology. A sentence \(\varphi\) of classical logic
is said to be <em>valid</em> (or a <em>tautology</em>) in case
\(\emptyset \vdash_{\CL} \varphi\), and <em>anti-valid</em> (or an
<em>antilogy</em>) in case \(\varphi \vdash_{\CL} \emptyset\). This
means that a classically valid sentence is true in every valuation,
while a classically anti-valid sentence is false in every
valuation.</p>

<h3 id="TwoThreTrutValuGapsGlut">2.2 From two to three truth values: gaps and gluts</h3>

<p>
There are many different ways in which the classical two-valued truth
tables can be extended by further values. In order to illustrate the
step from two-valued to many-valued logic on concrete examples, in
this subsection we focus on three simple ways in which the classical
truth tables can be extended by a third value. Broadly speaking, this
third value can represent a truth value gap (propositions taking this
value will be seen as neither true nor false) or a truth value glut
(propositions taking this value will be seen as both true and false).
Our choice of examples in this section is not meant to ascribe to them
any privileged position among the multitude of many-valued logics
introduced over the past century or so. Rather, these three-valued
logics will merely serve as convenient illustrations of how
many-valued logics can be defined and what kinds of concerns they are
meant to address.</p>

<p>
One of the simplest three-valued extensions of the classical
two-valued truth tables is the one introduced by Kleene (1938, 1952),
where the definition of a valuation (in terms of minima, maxima, and
subtraction) carries over verbatim from classical logic, except that
the set of classical truth values \(\{ 0, 1 \}\) is replaced by the
set of truth values \(\{ 0, \sfrac{1}{2}, 1 \}\). More explicitly, we
replace the two-element algebra \(\mathbf{B_2}\) by the algebra
\(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) (the <em>three-element Kleene algebra</em>) where
the truth constants \(\top\) and \(\bot\) are interpreted by the
elements 1 and 0 and the remaining connectives are interpreted as
follows:</p>

<p>
For example, if \(v(p) = \sfrac{1}{2}\) and \(v(q) = 0\) in a
valuation \(v\) in \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\), then</p> 
\[
  v((p \wedge \neg p) \vee q) = \max(\min(v(p), 1-v(p)), v(q)) =
\sfrac{1}{2}.
\]

<p>
As in the case of Boolean algebras, the algebra \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) is
often also considered without the truth constants \(\top\) and
\(\bot\), resulting in slight variants of the logics introduced
below.</p>

<p>
The above truth tables do not force any particular reading on the
truth value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\). Nonetheless, there are two natural ways
to interpret the value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) which fit well with them. The
first interpretation is to read \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) as &lsquo;Neither
True nor False&rsquo;. The second is to read \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) as
&lsquo;Both True and False&rsquo;. Here True and False are intended as
broad labels which may cashed out in different ways, in particular
they may but need not be interpreted in a metaphysically loaded way.
For instance, Kleene&rsquo;s original motivation for introducing these
truth tables falls under the former approach. He introduced them in
order to reason about partial recursive functions on natural numbers:
the value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) was meant to represent a situation where
the output of a partial recursive function is undefined, and
accordingly (Kleene 1952) denoted the truth values by \(\mathbf{t}\),
\(\mathbf{f}\), and \(\mathbf{u}\). Later, Kripke (1975) harnessed
Kleene&rsquo;s truth tables in the service of his influential theory
of truth, relying also on the former kind of reading for the value
\(\sfrac{1}{2}\). In contrast, Priest (1979) employed the latter kind
of reading in his proposal to resolve various semantic paradoxes such
as the Liar Paradox using Kleene&rsquo;s truth tables. In his
approach, the Liar sentence (&ldquo;This sentence is false&rdquo;) is
taken to be both true and false in a literal sense.</p>

<p>
Depending on which of the two broad interpretations of the third value
one chooses, the preservation of truth from the premise set to the
conclusion set can now be understood in two different ways. Under the
first interpretation, there is only one way for a sentence to be true
in a valuation, namely it must take the value 1. This naturally leads
to <em>strong Kleene logic</em> \(\K_{3}\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\K_{3}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in
\(\mathbf{\KA_3},\)</p> 
\[v(\varphi) = 1 
\text{ for all }  \varphi \in \Pi \impliest v(\psi) = 1 \text{ for some }
\psi \in \Sigma.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
The above definition in fact works at a much greater level of
generality. Replacing the particular algebra \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) by
<em>any</em> class of algebras \(\mathsf{K}\) in a signature
containing the constant \(\top\) and replacing valuations in
\(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) by valuations in arbitrary algebras in
\(\mathsf{K}\), we obtain the definition of the so-called
<em>assertional logic</em> of \(\mathsf{K}\) (or more explicitly, the
<em>\(\top\)-assertional logic</em> of \(\mathsf{K}\)). This is, as we
shall see, a very common way to define logics.</p>

<p>
Notice that the definition of an assertional logic in effect
translates logical reasoning into equational reasoning. For instance,
the Disjunctive Syllogism \(p, \neg p \vee q \vdash q\) is valid in
\(\K_{3}\) because for all \(x, y \in \mathbf{\KA_3}\)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if \(x = 1\) and \(\neg x \vee y = 1,\) then \(y = 1\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Under the second interpretation, there are two ways for a sentence to
be true in a valuation, namely it can either take the value 1 or the
value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\). This interpretation naturally leads to the
<em>Logic of Paradox</em> LP introduced by Asenjo (1966) and advanced
by Priest (1979):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{LP}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in
\(\mathbf{\KA_3},\)</p> 
\[v(\psi) = 0 
\text{ for all } \psi \in \Sigma \impliest  v(\varphi) = 0 \text{ for
  some }  \varphi \in \Pi.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
This definition also works at a greater level of generality, but the
resulting logics, which one might call <em>anti-assertional
logics</em>, have been studied much less than assertional logics (see
Shramko 2019 and P&#345;enosil 2023 and for a discussion of the
anti-assertional logic of \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\)). Notice that the logic
LP can be seen either as the logic of truth preservation when
\(\sfrac{1}{2}\) is given the reading Both True and False, or
equivalently as the logic of backward falsity preservation when
\(\sfrac{1}{2}\) is given the reading Neither True nor False.</p>

<p>
In addition, instead of truth preservation from the premise set to the
conclusion set, one can define consequence in terms of the natural
order on the algebra \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\): \(0 \lt \sfrac{1}{2}\lt 1\).
This order in effect treats the truth values as &lsquo;degrees of
truth&rsquo;, with the value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) being intermediate
between 0 and 1: not quite as true as 1, but more true than 0. This
order on \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) is in particular a <em>lattice</em> order:
each pair of values \(a, b\) has a greatest lower bound (meet) \(a
\wedge b\) and a smallest upper bound (join) \(a \vee b\). Because
\(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) is finite, it is in fact a <em>complete</em>
lattice order: each <em>set</em> of values \(X\) has a greatest lower
bound (meet) \(\bigwedge X\) and a smallest upper bound (join)
\(\bigvee X\).</p>

<p>
A definition of consequence based on degrees of truth then requires
that the conjunction of the sentences in the premise set be at least
as true as the disjunction of the sentences in the conclusion set.
This yields the logic called <em>Kleene&rsquo;s logic of order</em> KO
by Rivieccio (2012), considered earlier by Makinson (1973) under the
name <em>Kalman implication</em> and by Field (2008) under the name
<em>symmetric Kleene logic</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{KO}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in
\(\mathbf{\KA_3},\)</p> 
\[\bigwedge \{
v(\varphi) \mid \varphi \in \Pi \} \leq \bigvee \{ v(\psi) \mid \psi \in
\Sigma\}.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
This order-based definition of consequence works for any algebra
\(\mathbf{A}\) with the structure of a finite distributive lattice in
place of \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\). Indeed, if we restrict to the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
framework, it works for any complete
lattice \(\mathbf{A}\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{KO}} \varphi\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in
\(\mathbf{\KA_3},\)</p> 
\[ \bigwedge \{ v(\varphi) \mid
  \varphi \in \Pi \} \leq v(\varphi).\]

</blockquote>

<p>
This is a common way to define logics: it yields the so-called
<em>logic of order</em> of \(\mathbf{A}\). This logic will sometimes
coincide with the assertional logic of \(\mathbf{A}\) (for example,
when \(\mathbf{A}\) is a finite totally ordered Heyting algebra), but
typically the logic of order and the assertional logic will be
distinct.</p>

<p>
These three different ways of introducing consequence relations
(assertional logics, anti-assertional logics, and logics of order) are
natural generalizations of the three definitions of classical
consequence which we saw in the previous section. When applied to
finite algebras, they always yield finitary consequence relations.</p>

<p>
Other interpretations of the third truth value will naturally lead to
other truth tables and other logics. For instance, the third value may
represent a non-sensical or &ldquo;junk&rdquo; value \(*\), the
intuition being that a complex sentence should take the junk value
\(*\) if and only if at least one of its subsentences takes this
value. Under this reading it is natural to replace the three-element
Kleene algebra \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) by the algebra \(\mathbf{\WK_3}\)
(the <em>three-element weak Kleene algebra</em>) where the truth
constants \(\top\) and \(\bot\) are interpreted by the elements 1 and
0 and the remaining connectives are interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>
For example, if \(v(p) = 1\) and \(v(q) = *\) in a weak Kleene
valuation \(v\) in \(\mathbf{\WK_3}\), then</p> 
\[      v(p \wedge \neg q) = * = v(p \vee \neg q).\]

<p>
This truth table can again be used to define different consequence
relations, namely the logic \(\mathrm{B}_{3}\) introduced by Bochvar
(1938) and the paraconsistent weak Kleene logic PWK (see Bonzio,
Gil-F&eacute;rez, Paoli, &amp; Peruzzi 2017) introduced by
Halld&eacute;n (1949), who called it &lsquo;the Logic of
Nonsense&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{B}_{3}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\)
in \(\mathbf{\WK_3},\)</p> 
\[ v(\varphi) = 1 \text{ for all } \varphi \in \Pi \impliest v(\psi) = 1 \text{ for some } \psi \in \Sigma,\]

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\textrm{PWK}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in
\(\mathbf{\WK_3},\)</p> 
\[ v(\psi) = 0
\text{ for all } \psi \in \Sigma \impliest v(\varphi) = 0 \text{ for
some } \varphi \in \Pi.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
The algebra \(\mathbf{\WK_3}\) does not come with a single natural
order, therefore there is no clear analogue of Kleene&rsquo;s logic of
order here. Remarkably, the three-valued logics \(\mathrm{B}_{3}\) and
PWK can (in the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework) also be
introduced in a completely different way as, respectively, the
so-called right and left variable inclusion companions of classical
logic (see Bonzio, Paoli, &amp; Pra Baldi 2022). For example, in the
case of PWK this means that \(\Pi \vdash_{\textrm{PWK}} \varphi\) iff
there is some set of sentences \(\Sigma \subseteq \Pi\) such that
\(\Sigma \vdash_{\CL} \varphi\) and the set of variables that occur in
\(\Sigma\) is included in the set of variables that occur in
\(\varphi\).</p>

<h3 id="TrueFalsNeitBoth">2.3 True, False, Neither, and Both</h3>

<p>
The logics \(\K_{3}\) and LP are based on interpreting the third value
as a &lsquo;truth value gap&rsquo; (Neither True nor False) and a
&lsquo;truth value glut&rsquo; (Both True and False), respectively.
One may go a step further and allow for both of these possibilities.
This results in the algebra \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\) (the <em>four-element
De Morgan algebra</em>) where the truth constants \(\top\) and
\(\bot\) are interpreted by the elements \(\mathsf{t}\) and
\(\mathsf{f}\) and the remaining connectives are interpreted as
follows:</p>

<p>
A more concise way of stating these truth tables is to say that \(x
\wedge^{\mathbf{\DM_4}} y\) is the greatest lower bound (the
<em>meet</em>) and \(x \vee^{\mathbf{\DM_4}} y\) is the least upper
bound (the <em>join</em>) of the values \(x\) and \(y\) in the partial
order represented by the following Hasse diagram:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img style="width:8em" src="figure1.svg" alt="four nodes arranged in a square t, b, f, and n with adjacent corners connected by lines" />
</div>

<p>
Notice that the truth values are no longer linearly ordered.</p>

<p>
The motivation behind the truth tables for \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\) is
simple: \(x \wedge y\) should be true iff \(x\) is true and \(y\) is
true, and likewise \(x \wedge y\) should be false iff \(x\) is false
or \(y\) is false. Interpreting &ldquo;\(x\) is true&rdquo; as \(x \in
\{ \mathsf{t}, \mathsf{b}\}\) and &ldquo;\(x\) is false&rdquo; as \(x
\in \{ \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{b}\}\) now immediately yields the truth
table for conjunction. For example, this interpretation tells us that
\(\mathsf{n}\wedge \mathsf{b}= \mathsf{f}\) holds in
\(\mathbf{\DM_4}\), since \(\mathsf{n}\wedge \mathsf{b}\) must be
false (i.e., must lie in \(\{ \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{b}\}\)) due to the
conjunct \(\mathsf{b}\) being false, and \(\mathsf{n}\wedge
\mathsf{b}\) cannot be true (i.e., cannot lie in \(\{ \mathsf{t},
\mathsf{b}\}\)) due to the conjunct \(\mathsf{n}\) not being true. The
truth tables for disjunction and negation are motivated by similar
reasoning.</p>

<p>
Observe that if one restricts in the truth tables for
\(\mathbf{\DM_4}\) to the set of values \(\{ \mathsf{t}, \mathsf{f},
\mathsf{n}\}\) or to the set of values \(\{ \mathsf{t}, \mathsf{f},
\mathsf{b}\}\), one obtains the truth tables for \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\)
(up to a relabelling of the truth values). In algebraic terms,
\(\mathbf{\DM_4}\) has two subalgebras with universes \(\{ \mathsf{t},
\mathsf{f}, \mathsf{n}\}\) and \(\{ \mathsf{t}, \mathsf{f},
\mathsf{b}\}\) which are isomorphic to \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\). This
justifies the interpretation of the value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) in
\(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) as either the value Neither True nor False or the
value Both True and False.</p>

<p>
There are again a number of options when it comes to defining a
consequence relation based on \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\), many of which
coincide. Preserving truth (membership in \(\{ \mathsf{t},
\mathsf{b}\}\)) from the premise set to the conclusion set, preserving
non-falsity (membership in \(\{ \mathsf{t}, \mathsf{n}\}\)) from the
premise set to the conclusion set, and comparing the relative order of
the sentences on the premise set and in the conclusion set all yield
the same consequence relation. This is the four-valued
Belnap&ndash;Dunn logic BD. More explicitly,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{BD}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) on
\(\mathbf{\DM_4},\)</p>

<p>
\(v(\varphi) \in \{\mathsf{t}, \mathsf{b}\} \text{ for all } \varphi
\in \Pi\) <span class="nw">&nbsp;implies&nbsp;&nbsp;\(v(\psi) \in \{
\mathsf{t}, \mathsf{b}\} \text{ for some } \psi \in
\Sigma,\)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or equivalently</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{BD}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) on
\(\mathbf{\DM_4},\)</p>

<p>
\(v(\varphi) \in \{ \mathsf{t}, \mathsf{n}\} \text{ for all } \varphi
\in \Pi\) <span class="nw">&nbsp;implies&nbsp;&nbsp;\(v(\psi) \in \{
\mathsf{t}, \mathsf{n}\} \text{ for some } \psi \in \Sigma,\)</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
or equivalently</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{BD}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) on
\(\mathbf{\DM_4},\)</p> 
\[ \bigwedge \{
v(\varphi) \mid \varphi \in \Pi \} \leq \bigvee \{ v(\psi) \mid \psi \in
\Sigma \},\]

</blockquote>

<p>
where \(\leq\) is the partial order depicted in the Hasse diagram
above, and \(\bigwedge X\) and \(\bigvee X\) are, respectively, the
greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of a set \(X \subseteq
\mathbf{\DM_4}\) in this order. In other words, BD is the logic of
order of the algebra \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\).</p>

<p>
The logic BD was introduced by Dunn (1976) under the name First-Degree
Entailment (FDE) as a fragment of the so-called logic of entailment,
and championed by Belnap (1977a,b) as a logic well-suited for handling
incomplete and inconsistent information (see Shramko &amp; Wansing
2011: chs. 3 &amp; 4 for a generalization of this perspective). Belnap
imagined a computer collecting propositional input from users, with no
guarantee of consistency between different users. For instance, one
user might input the information that \(p\) is true and \(q\) if false
(where \(p\) and \(q\) are entirely unrelated propositions), while
another user might input the information that \(p\) as false. If the
computer were to na&#305;&#776;vely use classical logic, it would be
forced to deduce that \(q\) is true, since \(p, \neg p \vdash_{\CL}
q\). However, this is not the desired behavior: contradictory
information about the entirely unrelated proposition \(p\) should not
force the computer to throw away perfectly good information about
\(q\). In other words, if we query the computer about \(q\), it should
return a negative answer. The computer that uses BD instead of \(\CL\)
to reason about its information input achieves this, since \(p, \neg p
\nvdash_{\mathrm{BD}} q\).</p>

<p>
Besides BD, the logic of order of the algebra \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\), one
may also wonder about the assertional logic and the anti-assertional
logic of \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\). These are the logics determined
respectively by the preservation of <em>exact truth</em> (the element
\(\mathsf{t}\)) and the backward preservation of <em>exact
falsity</em> (the element \(\mathsf{f}\)). The former is the Exactly
True Logic ETL (see Marcos 2011 and Pietz &amp; Rivieccio 2013):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\ETL} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in
\(\mathbf{\DM_4},\)</p> 
\[ v(\varphi) =
\mathsf{t} \text{ for all } \varphi \in \Pi \impliest v(\psi) =
\mathsf{t} \text{ for some } \psi \in \Sigma,\]

</blockquote>

<p>
the latter is the logic of Anything But Falsehood ABF (see Marcos 2011
and Shramko 2019):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{ABF}} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) on
\(\mathbf{\DM_4},\)</p> 
\[v(\psi) = \mathsf{f} \text{ for all } \psi \in \Sigma \impliest
  v(\varphi) = \mathsf{f} \text{ for some } \varphi \in \Pi.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
Notably, unlike all the other logics considered in this section, the
logic ABF does not validate the Adjunction rule \(x, y \vdash x \wedge
y\), while the logic ETL does not validate the dual Abjunction rule
\(x \vee y \vdash x, y\).</p>

<p>
Like all logics over the same set of sentences, the logics introduced
above can be ordered in terms of their logical strength. A logic
\(\L_{1}\) is said to be a <em>sublogic</em> of a logic \(\L_{2}\)
over the same set of sentences, and \(\L_{2}\) is said to be an
<em>extension</em> of \(\L_{1}\), in symbols \(\L_{1} \leq \L_{2}\),
if</p> 
\[
  \Pi \vdash_{\L_{1}} \Sigma \impliest \Pi
\vdash_{\L_{2}} \Sigma \text{ for all } \Pi, \Sigma \subseteq
Fm.\]

<p>
Extensions of BD are known as super-Belnap logics (see Rivieccio
2012). In particular, this family includes the logics CL, \(\K_{3}\),
LP, KO, which are ordered by logical strength as follows:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img style="width:8em" src="figure2.svg" alt="four nodes arranged in a square: K_3, CL, LP, KO. With the adjacent nodes connected by lines. Outside the square node BD has a line connecting it to KO." />
</div>

<p>
For a more detailed discussion of these logics, we refer the reader to
Albuquerque, P&#345;enosil, and Rivieccio (2017); Avron, Arieli, and
Zamansky (2018); and P&#345;enosil (2023). Because every classical
valuation can also be seen as a valuation on \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\) or on
\(\mathbf{\DM_4}\), the logics \(\K_{3}\), LP, KO, and BD are
sublogics of classical logic. They are <em>proper</em> sublogics:
there are rules of classical logic that fail in these four
non-classical logics. Notably, the Law of Excluded Middle \(\emptyset
\vdash p \vee \neg p\) holds in CL and in LP but fails in \(\K_{3}\)
and BD, as witnessed by valuations \(v\) with, respectively, \(v(p) =
\sfrac{1}{2}\) and \(v(p) = \mathsf{n}\). On the other hand, the
Principle of Explosion expressed as \(p \wedge \neg p
\vdash\emptyset\) and the Disjunctive Syllogism \(p, \neg p \vee q
\vdash q\) hold in CL and \(\K_{3}\) but they both fail in LP, as
witnessed by any valuation \(v\) with \(v(p) = \sfrac{1}{2}\) and
\(v(q) = 0\). This shows that \(\K_{3}\leq \CL\) and \(\mathrm{LP}\leq
\CL\) but \(\CL\nleq \K_{3}\) and \(\CL\nleq \mathrm{LP}\). Finally,
the reader may easily verify from their respective definitions that
the logic KO is the intersection of the logics \(\K_{3}\) and LP, in
the sense that</p> 
\[
  \Gamma \vdash_{\mathrm{KO}} \Delta \text{ iff both } \Gamma
\vdash_{\K_{3}} \Delta \andt \Gamma \vdash_{\mathrm{LP}}
\Delta.\]

<p>
While neither the Law of Excluded Middle nor the Principle of
Explosion holds in KO, their combination \(p \wedge \neg p \vdash q
\vee \neg q\) holds in KO but not in BD. (We encourage the reader to
verify the claims made in this paragraph on their own.)</p>

<p>
The valid sentences of any of these logics \(\L\) are again the
sentences \(\varphi\) such that \(\emptyset \vdash_{\L} \varphi\),
while the anti-valid sentences are defined by the condition \(\varphi
\vdash_{\L} \emptyset\). Notably, the logics \(\K_{3}\) and LP agree
with classical logic at least on some rules: the same sentences are
valid in LP and in CL, while the same sentences are anti-valid in
\(\K_{3}\) and CL. This illustrates that it is not sufficient to treat
logics merely as sets of sentences, be they tautologies or antilogies.
In contrast, if we restrict to the constant-free fragment of the
language, i.e., to sentences without the truth constants \(\top\) and
\(\bot\), then the logic \(\K_{3}\) has no valid sentences, while the
logic LP has no anti-valid sentences. Both of these facts are
witnessed by the valuation \(v\) where every propositional variable
takes value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\), since then \(v(\varphi) = \sfrac{1}{2}\)
for every sentence \(\varphi\) in the constant-free fragment.
Similarly, there are neither valid sentences nor anti-valid sentences
in the constant-free fragment of the logic BD.</p>

<h3 id="ContTrutValu">2.4 A continuum of truth values</h3>

<p>
The previous subsections showed how classical truth-tables can be
extended by further truth values to yield various many-valued logics.
The examples that we have seen so far were all <em>finite-valued</em>
logics. However, many-valued logics need not be based on only finitely
many truth values. Indeed, a frequent theme in many-valued logic is to
replace the two-element set of truth values \(\{ 0, 1 \}\) by a
continuum of truth values represented by the real unit interval \([0,
1]\). This is in fact one of the characteristic features of
 <a href="../logic-fuzzy/">fuzzy logics</a>,
 which form one of the best studied families of many-valued logics
(see H&aacute;jek 1998 and Cintula, H&aacute;jek, &amp; Noguera 2011).
The motivation for this stems from the idea that truth comes in
degrees, in particular that propositions may be partly true to some
degree strictly between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>
Such logics typically distinguish between two kinds of conjunction.
Some, like &#321;ukasiewicz logic, also distinguish between two kinds
of disjunction. The familiar <em>lattice</em> conjunction \(\wedge\)
and disjunction \(\vee\) (also called <em>additive</em> or
<em>extensional</em> connectives) are interpreted respectively as the
minimum and the maximum of two values in \([0, 1]\), and the truth
constants \(\top\) and \(\bot\) are interpreted by 1 and 0. In
addition, these logics also feature a <em>monoidal</em> conjunction
\(\odot\) (also called <em>multiplicative</em> or <em>intensional</em>
conjunction), which may combine two truth values in a more complicated
way. Often the interpretation of \(\odot\) is required to be a
so-called <em>continuous t-norm</em> (in technical terms: a continuous
commutative associative operation having 1 as a neutral element). Each
such binary operation \(\odot\) on \([0, 1]\) naturally determines a
unique implication operation \(\rightarrow\), called the
<em>residual</em> of \(\odot\), via the so-called <em>residuation
law</em>:</p> 
\[
    x \odot y \leq z \ifft  y \leq x \rightarrow z.
\]

<p>
This gives the unit interval \([0, 1]\) the structure of an algebra
\([0, 1]_{\odot}\) with an associated \(\top\)-assertional logic
\(\L\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\L} \Sigma\) iff for every valuation \(v\) in \([0,
1],\)</p> 
\[ v(\varphi) = 1 \text{ for all }
\varphi \in \Pi \impliest v(\psi) = 1 \text{ for some } \psi \in
\Sigma.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
As in classical logic, the negation \(\neg\) can be defined as \(\neg
x := x \rightarrow \bot\).</p>

<p>
The residuation law connecting \(\odot\) and \(\rightarrow\) can be
thought of as an algebraic counterpart of the deduction theorem. It is
the characteristic property of the broad class of so-called
 <a href="../logic-substructural/">substructural logics</a>,
 which subsumes a number of notable subfamilies besides fuzzy logics,
such as so-called <em>super-intuitionistic</em> or
<em>intermediate</em> logics (the axiomatic extensions of
intuitionistic logic) and <em>relevance logics</em>. The monographs of
Galatos, Jipsen, Kowalski, &amp; Ono (2007) and Metcalfe, Paoli, &amp;
Tsinakis (2023) treat the family of substructural logics in great
detail.</p>

<p>
Even staying within the realm of fuzzy logics, different applications
call for different choices of t-norms. Indeed, the many-valued
logician need not be constrained to the study of one particular
t-norm. For instance, H&aacute;jek&rsquo;s so-called <em>Basic
Logic</em> (BL) is the logic of all continuous t-norms on \([0, 1]\)
in the following sense:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \vdash_{\mathrm{BL}} \Sigma\) iff for every continuous t-norm
\(\odot\) on \([0, 1]\) and every valuation \(v\) in \([0,
1]_{\odot},\)</p> 
\[ v(\varphi) = 1 \text{ for all } \varphi \in \Pi \impliest
v(\psi) = 1 \text{ for some } \psi \in \Sigma.\]

</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, the <em>monoidal t-norm logic</em> \(\mathrm{MTL}\) is the
logic of all left-continuous t-norms on \([0, 1]\). One common
definition of fuzzy logics identifies them as the axiomatic extensions
of \(\mathrm{MTL}\). In other words, BL is the \(\top\)-assertional
logic determined by the class of all algebras of the form \([0,
1]_{\odot}\), where \(\odot\) ranges over continuous t-norms on \([0,
1]\).</p>

<p>
Some of the best-known many-valued logics, such as G&ouml;del logic
\(\G_{\infty}\) (also called G&ouml;del&ndash;Dummett logic),
<em>product logic</em> \(\Pi\), and &#321;ukasiewicz logic
\(\L_{\infty}\), arise from a continuous t-norm on the unit interval
\([0, 1]\). In the case of <em>G&ouml;del logic</em>, the intensional
conjunction and the associated implication \(\rightarrow\) are defined
as:</p> 
\[
      x \odot y := \min(x, y), \qquad
      x \rightarrow y  := 
\begin{cases} 
 1 \text{ if } x \leq y, \\ 
 y \text{ if } y \lt x. 
\end{cases}
\]

<p>
That is, the intensional conjunction \(\odot\) coincides with the
lattice conjunction \(\wedge\). In the case of <em>product logic</em>,
the intensional conjunction \(\odot\) and the associated implication
\(\rightarrow\) are defined as:</p> 
\[
      x \odot y := x \cdot y, \qquad
      x \rightarrow y := \begin{cases} 
 1 \text{ if } x \leq y, \\ 
 \frac{y}{x} \text{ if } y \lt x. 
\end{cases}
\]

<p>
That is, the intensional conjunction \(\odot\) is the ordinary
multiplication of real numbers. Finally, in the case of
<em>&#321;ukasiewicz logic</em>, studied extensively by Cignoli,
D&rsquo;Ottaviano, and Mundici (2000), the intensional conjunction
\(\odot\) (often called <em>fusion</em>) and the associated
implication \(\rightarrow\) are defined as:</p> 
\[
      x \odot y := \max(x+y-1,0), \qquad
      x \rightarrow y := \min(1 - x + y, 1).
\]

<p>
This definition of \(\odot\) and \(\rightarrow\) may look baffling at
first sight. To see that they are indeed natural definitions of
conjunction and implication, it is perhaps more convenient to think of
them in terms of the intensional <em>disjunction</em> \(\oplus\) and
negation \(\neg\):</p> 
\[      x \oplus y := \min(x+y, 1), \qquad \neg x  := 1 - x.\]

<p>
This continuous version of the disjunction connective is a very
natural one: the degree of truth of \(x \oplus y\) is the sum of the
degrees of truth of \(x\) and \(y\), capped at 1 as the largest degree
of truth. The intensional conjunction \(\odot\) is then merely the De
Morgan dual of \(\oplus\) with respect to the negation, in the sense
that \(x \odot y = \neg (\neg x \oplus \neg y)\). Equivalently,
thinking of \(1 - x\) as the degree of falsity of \(x\), the
definition of \(\odot\) in &#321;ukasiewicz logic simply says that the
degree of falsity of \(x \odot y\) is the sum of the degrees of
falsity of \(x\) and \(y\), again capped at 1. The implication of
&#321;ukasiewicz logic is then a natural continuous version of
classical implication: \(x \rightarrow y = \neg x \oplus y\).</p>

<p>
The infinite-valued G&ouml;del and &#321;ukasiewicz logics both have
finite-valued relatives. For each natural number \(n \geq 1\) the
algebra \([0,1]_{\G}\) equipped with the G&ouml;del connectives has a
<em>subalgebra</em> \(\mathbf{G}_{n+1}\) with the universe \(\{ 0,
\frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n}, \dots, 1 - \frac{1}{n}, 1 \}\). That is, the
finite algebra \(\mathbf{G}_{n+1}\) is obtained from the infinite
algebra \([0,1]_{\G}\) by restricting its operations to this subset.
For instance, the truth tables for \(\mathbf{G_3}\) (excluding the
lattice connectives) are the following:</p>

Replacing \([0,1]_{\G}\) by \(\mathbf{G}_{n+1}\) in the definition of
infinite-valued G&ouml;del logic \(G_{\infty}\) then yields the family
of finite-valued G&ouml;del logics \(\G_{n+1}\). Similarly, the
algebra \([0,1]_{\L}\) equipped with the &#321;ukasiewicz connectives
has a subalgebra \(\L_{n+1}\) with the universe \(\{ 0, \frac{1}{n},
\frac{2}{n}, \dots, 1 - \frac{1}{n}, 1 \}\). For example, the truth
tables for \(\L_{3}\) (excluding the lattice connectives) are the

<p>
This yields the family of finite-valued &#321;ukasiewicz logics
\(\L_{n+1}\). In addition to these finite subalgebras, the uncountable
algebras \([0,1]_{\G}\) and \([0,1]_{\L}\) also both have a countable
subalgebra whose universe is the rational unit interval \([0, 1] \cap
\mathbb{Q}\). These rational subalgebras determine the same logic as
the full algebra.</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del and &#321;ukasiewicz logics are examples of
<em>subclassical</em> logics: sublogics of classical logic. This is
because restricting to valuations which take only the values 0 and 1
yields precisely classical valuations. However, not all substructural
logics have this property. An example of this phenomenon is provided
by Abelian logic (see Meyer &amp; Slaney 1989), where propositions are
evaluated in the lattice-ordered additive group of real numbers, with
the designed values being the non-negative numbers. The implication
connective in this logic is interpreted as \(a \rightarrow b := -a +
b\). This logic is <em>contraclassical</em> in the sense that it
validates some rules, indeed some theorems, which are not valid in
classical logic. The canonical illustration is the formula \(((p
\rightarrow q) \rightarrow q) \rightarrow p\), which is a theorem of
Abelian logic, but of course not a theorem of classical logic.</p>

<p>
Having seen some examples of infinite-valued logics, let us call
attention to two new phenomena which may occur in this context.
Firstly, unlike finite algebras, an infinite algebra of truth values
may induce a <em>non-finitary</em> logic (recall
 <a href="#Clas2ValuLogi">section 2.1</a>
 for the definition of finitariness). A notable example is
\(\L_{\infty}\), as witnessed by the following infinitary rule:</p>

\[
     p \rightarrow q, p \rightarrow q^{2}, p \rightarrow q^{3}, \ldots
\vdash_{\L_{\infty}} \neg p \vee q.\]

<p>
This rule expresses the so-called Archimedean property of
\([0,1]_{\L}\), which bans infinitely small quantities.</p>

<p>
Secondly, finite-valued logics are <em>decidable</em>: there is an
algorithm to determine whether \(\Pi \vdash \Sigma\) for finite
\(\Pi\) and \(\Sigma\), namely (in the worst case) one can always
simply go through all valuations on the finite set of truth values. In
contrast, whether or not an infinite-valued logic is decidable is a
non-trivial question. For instance, infinite-valued &#321;ukasiewicz
and G&ouml;del logics are decidable. In particular, in terms of their
computational complexity, the problem of deciding theoremhood (whether
a sentence \(\varphi\) is a theorem) and the problem of deciding
deducibility (whether \(\Pi \vdash \Sigma\) holds) are both
coNP-complete for \(\L_{\infty}\) and \(\G_{\infty}\) (see Mundici
1987 and Baaz, H&aacute;jek, Kraj&iacute;&#269;ek, &amp; &Scaron;vejda
1998) as they are for classical logic. The corresponding problems for
intuitionistic logic are PSPACE-complete (see Statman 1979), while for
some logics, such as the Full Lambek calculus with exchange and
contraction, they are decidable but with non-primitive recursive
complexity (see Urquhart 1999). In some logics, such as the Full
Lambek calculus with exchange theoremhood in a given logic is
decidable but deducibility is not, while in Full Lambek calculus with
contraction neither problem is decidable (see Chvalovsk&yacute; &amp;
Hor&#269;&iacute;k 2016 and Lincoln, Mitchell, Scedrov, &amp; Shankar
1992).</p>

<h3 id="InfeBehaLogiConn">2.5 The inferential behavior of logical connectives</h3>

<p>
Each of the non-classical consequence relations introduced above can
be studied as an object in its own right in much the same way that the
consequence relation of classical logic can. These consequence
relations will differ from classical logic in many respects.
Nonetheless, they often contain connectives which deserve to be called
conjunction, disjunction, negation, or implication. These may not
validate precisely the same logical rules as their classical
counterparts, but one may still observe some characteristic patterns
in their deductive behavior, which can moreover be stated
independently of the particular choice of logical signature. In this
subsection we review the most important of these principles.</p>

<p>
In our discussion of these principles, it will be convenient to
restrict to a single-conclusion setting. That is, in this subsection
and the next one, we shall only consider <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
consequence relations and we shall use the
following abbreviation:</p> 
\[    \Pi \vdash^{\amp} \Sigma \ifft  \Pi \vdash \alpha
\text{ for each } \alpha \in \Sigma.\]

<p>
In other words, this notation indicates that the conclusion set is to
be interpreted conjunctively rather than disjunctively as in <span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
consequence relations.</p>

<p>
The fundamental property enjoyed by the implication connective of
classical logic is the Deduction Theorem, sometimes more explicitly
called the Deduction&ndash;Detachment Theorem. It states that for all
sets of sentences \(\Pi\) and all sentences \(\varphi\) and
\(\psi\)</p> 
\[
      \Pi, \varphi \vdash_{\CL} \psi \ifft  \Pi
\vdash_{\CL} \varphi \rightarrow \psi.\]

<p>
This property is shared by intuitionistic and G&ouml;del logic
\(\G_{\infty}\) as well as the finite-valued G&ouml;del logics
\(\G_{n}\). In contrast, it fails in both infinite-valued
&#321;ukasiewicz logic \(\L_{\infty}\) and in \(n\)-valued
&#321;ukasiewicz logics \(\L_{n}\) for \(n &gt; 2\). For example, \(p
\vdash_{\L_{n}} p \odot p\) but \(\emptyset \nvdash_{\L_{n}} p
\rightarrow (p \odot p)\) for \(n &gt; 2\). The failure of the above
equivalence in \(\L_{n}\) for \(n &gt; 2\) is, however, merely due to
the fact that \(x \rightarrow y\) is not the right implication
connective for this purpose. The Deduction Theorem can be fixed by
shifting our attention from the primitive implication connective \(x
\rightarrow y\) to the defined binary connective</p> 
\[
      x \supset y := x^{n} \rightarrow y, \qquad \text{where
} x^{n} := \overbrace{x \odot \cdots \odot x}^{n \text{ occurrences of }
x},\]

<p>
This restores the Deduction Theorem in the following form:</p>

\[
      \Pi, \varphi \vdash_{\L_{n}} \psi \ifft  \Pi
\vdash_{\L_{n}} \varphi \supset \psi.\]

<p>
Accordingly, we say that a logic \(\L\) has the <em>Deduction
Theorem</em> if there is some set of sentences in two variables \(I(x,
y)\) which collectively acts as a well-behaved implication in the
sense that</p> 
\[
      \Pi, \varphi \vdash_{\L} \psi \ifft \Pi
\vdash_{\L}^{\amp}  I(\varphi, \psi).\]

<p>
This principle in particular allows us to reconstruct a finitary
consequence relation from its set of theorems. The set of sentences
\(I(x, y)\), if it exists in a given logic \(\L\), is uniquely
determined by \(\L\) up to interderivability. More precisely, if
\(J(x, y)\) is another such set of sentences, then the Deduction
Theorem immediately implies that \(I(x, y) \vdash^{\amp}_{\L} J(x,y)\)
and \(J(x, y) \vdash^{\amp}_{\L} I(x, y)\).</p>

<p>
Implication is not the only logical connective whose essential
properties can be abstracted into an equivalence of this kind. The
characteristic inferential behavior of classical disjunction (in the
<span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework), for instance, is
expressed by the following equivalence:</p> 
\[\Pi, \varphi \vdash_{\CL} \chi \andt \Pi, \psi
\vdash_{\CL} \chi \ifft  \Pi, \varphi \vee \psi
\vdash_{\CL} \chi.\]

<p>
Again, we wish to state this principle in a way which is not
prejudiced as to the precise syntactic shape the sentence or set of
sentences expressing disjunction. Accordingly, a logic \(\L\) is said
to have the <em>Proof by Cases Property</em> if there is some set of
sentences in two variables \(D(x, y)\) which collectively acts as a
well-behaved disjunction in the sense that</p> 
\[\Pi, \varphi \vdash_{\L} \chi \andt  \Pi, \psi
\vdash_{\L} \chi \ifft  \Gamma, D(\varphi, \psi)
\vdash_{\L} \chi.\]

<p>
This equivalence in effect expresses a left introduction and a left
elimination rule for disjunction. The set of sentences \(D(x, y)\) is
again uniquely determined up to interderivability. The Proof by Cases
Property in the usual form with \(D(x, y) := \{ x \vee y \}\) holds in
almost all of the logics we have defined so far. The sole exception is
the Exactly True Logic \(\ETL\): not only does the connective denoted
by the symbol \(\vee\) fail to obey the Proof by Cases Property in
\(\ETL\) (since \(p \wedge \neg p \vdash_{\ETL} q\) and \(q
\vdash_{\ETL}q\) but \((p \wedge \neg p) \vee q \nvdash_{\ETL} q\)),
but in fact there is no set of sentences \(D(x, y)\) obeying this
property in \(\ETL\). An example of a logic which, in contrast, has
the Proof by Cases Property but only for a non-singleton set of
sentences \(D(x, y)\) is provided by the implicational fragment of
G&ouml;del logic \(\G_{\infty}\), i.e., its restriction to the
signature which only contains \(\rightarrow\) (see Cintula &amp;
Noguera 2013). In this fragment, one may take</p> 
\[
    D(x, y) := \{ (x \rightarrow y) \rightarrow y, (y \rightarrow x)
\rightarrow x \}.\]

<p>
In comparison, in the implicational fragment of &#321;ukasiewicz logic
\(\L_{\infty}\) one may take either \(D := \{ (x \rightarrow y)
\rightarrow y \}\) or \(D := \{ (y \rightarrow x) \rightarrow x
\}\).</p>

<p>
The analogous property for conjunction is trivial (in the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
framework) in the sense that in every logic
\(\L\) there is a set of sentences in two variables \(C(x, y)\) such
that</p> 
\[
      \Pi \vdash_{\L} \varphi \andt  \Pi
\vdash_{\L} \psi \ifft \Gamma
\vdash_{\L}^{\amp}  C(x, y),\]

<p>
or equivalently such that</p> 
\[
      \Pi, \varphi, \psi \vdash_{\L} \chi \ifft 
\Pi, C(\varphi, \psi) \vdash_{\L} \chi,\]

<p>
or yet equivalently such that</p> 
\[  p, q  \vdash_{\L} C(p, q)\qquad C(p, q) 
\vdash_{\L} p \qquad  C(p, q)  \vdash_{\L} q.\]

<p>
Namely, it suffices to take \(C(x, y) := \{ x, y \}\). Accordingly,
the property of interest when it comes to conjunction is instead
whether in the above equivalences we can take \(C(x, y) := \{
{\wedge}(x, y) \}\) for some single sentence in two variables
\(\wedge(x, y)\). In that case we say that \(\L\) <em>has a
conjunction</em>. This property ensures that a finitary <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
consequence relation can be reconstructed
from its <span class="sc">Fmla-Fmla</span> restriction as follows:</p>

\[
    \gamma_{1}, \dots, \gamma_{n} \vdash_{\L} \varphi \ifft
 {\wedge}(\gamma_1, {\wedge}(\gamma_2, \ldots {\wedge}
(\gamma_{n-1}, \gamma_n) \ldots)) \vdash\varphi.\]

<p>
All of the logics considered in the previous sections have a
conjunction, except for the four-valued logic of Anything But
Falsehood ABF.</p>

<p>
Notably, (<span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>) logics which arise as the
finitary logics of order of some variety \(\mathsf{K}\) of
semilattice-ordered algebras can be characterized abstractly as
precisely the <em>self-extensional</em> finitary logics \(\L\) with a
conjunction (see Jansana 2006). This property, also known as
<em>congruentiality</em>, states that the interderivability relation
is a congruence on the algebra of sentences. More explicitly:</p>

\[  \varphi \dashv\vdash_{\L} \psi \impliest
\alpha[x\mapsto\varphi] \dashv\vdash_{\L} \alpha[x\mapsto\psi],
\]

<p>
where \(\varphi \dashv\vdash_{\L} \psi\) is shorthand for the
conjunction of \(\varphi \vdash_{\L} \psi\) and \(\psi \vdash_{\L}
\varphi\), and \(\chi[z\mapsto\gamma]\) denotes the result of
uniformly substituting \(\gamma\) for all occurrences of the variable
\(z\) in the sentence \(\chi\). For example, unlike Kleene&rsquo;s
logic of order KO, the strong Kleene logic \(\K_{3}\) and the Logic of
Paradox LP are not the logics of order of any class of algebras, since
they have a conjunction but</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
       p \wedge \neg p \dashv \vdash_{\K_{3}} q \wedge \neg
q &amp;\qquad  \text{while} &amp; \neg (p \wedge \neg p) 
\nvdash_{\K_{3}} \neg (q \wedge \neg q), \\
       p \vee \neg p \dashv \vdash_{\mathrm{LP}} q \vee \neg q
&amp;\qquad  \text{while} &amp; \neg (p \vee \neg p) 
\nvdash_{\mathrm{LP}} \neg (q \vee \neg q).
\end{align*}\]

<p>
In some cases the logic of order of the variety \(\mathsf{K}\) will
coincide with its \(\top\)-assertional logic. This happens if and only
if the assertional logic is self-extensional, or equivalently if and
only if the logic of order is a so-called algebraizable logic (Font
2016).</p>

<p>
The above review of various inferential principles merely scratches
the surface. We have not touched at all on the topic of
 <a href="../negation/">negation</a>,
 for which the analogue of the Deduction Theorem is the so-called
Inconsistency Lemma (see Raftery 2013 and L&aacute;vi&#269;ka,
Moraschini, &amp; Raftery 2022). One also frequently needs to consider
the above properties in some suitably generalized form. For example,
unlike finite-valued &#321;ukasiewicz logics \(\L_{n}\),
infinite-valued &#321;ukasiewicz logic \(\L_{\infty}\) does not have a
Deduction Theorem. However, it does satisfy the following
equivalence:</p> 
\[
      \Pi, \varphi \vdash\psi \ifft  \text{there is some}\ n
\in \mathbb{N} \ \text{such that}\ \Pi \vdash\varphi^{n} \rightarrow \psi.
  \]

<p>
This is an instance of the so-called Local Deduction Theorem: a
weakening of the Deduction Theorem which states that there is a family
\(\Psi\) of sets of sentences in two variables such that</p>

\[
    \Gamma, \varphi \vdash\psi \ifft  \Gamma \vdash^{\amp}
I(\varphi, \psi)\ \text{ for some }\ I(x, y) \in \Psi.\]

<p>
Besides the Local Deduction Theorem, so-called Parametrized,
Parametrized Local, and Contextual Deduction Theorems have also been
studied (see Czelakowski 2001 and Font 2016). For instance, all
substructural logics satisfy the Parametrized Local Deduction Theorem,
while the three-valued Kleene logic \(\K_{3}\) and the Logic of
Paradox LP do not satisfy any of these generalizations of the
Deduction Theorem (see Albuquerque et al. 2017).</p>

<p>
The inferential principles listed above are syntactic principles, that
is, they are formulated purely in terms of (the algebra of) formulas,
as opposed to other algebras. A major theme in algebraic logic has
been to formulate semantic counterparts to such principles, which talk
about the properties of the algebraic semantics associated with a
logic. In full generality this involves the matrix semantics
introduced in the next section. However, in the well-behaved case of
so-called algebraizable logics (see Blok &amp; Pigozzi 1989), it is
sufficient to consider the so-called <em>algebraic counterpart</em> of
a logic \(\L\), which is a class of algebras
\(\mathop{\textrm{Alg}}\L\) (in the signature of \(\L\)) naturally
associated with \(\L\). For instance, the algebraic counterpart of
classical logic (CL) is the class of Boolean algebras, the algebraic
counterpart of intuitionistic logic (IL) is the class of Heyting
algebras, and the algebraic counterpart of Belnap&ndash;Dunn logic
(BD) is the class of De Morgan algebras.</p>

<p>
As an example of what such semantic counterparts look like, the
Deduction Theorem corresponds to the algebraic property called the
Equational Definability of Principal Relative Congruences (EDPRC).
More explicitly, a logic \(\L\) has a Deduction Theorem if and only if
its algebraic counterpart \(\mathop{\mathrm{Alg}}\L\) has EDPRC (see
Blok &amp; Pigozzi 2001). This equivalence is a convenient tool when
it comes to showing that some logics, such as infinite-valued
&#321;ukasiewicz logic \(\L_{\infty}\), do not admit a Deduction
Theorem. Similarly, a logic \(\L\) has a Local Deduction Theorem if
and only if \(\mathop{\mathrm{Alg}}\L\) has the so-called Relative
Congruence Extension Property. Equivalences of this type, connecting a
syntactic property of a logic \(\L\) with an algebraic property of
\(\mathop{\mathrm{Alg}}\L\), are called <em>bridge theorems</em>. Each
of the syntactic principles mentioned in this section has a bridge
theorem which gives it a semantic meaning. The reader looking for more
details should refer to the dedicated entry on
 <a href="../logic-algebraic-propositional/">algebraic propositional logic</a>,
 where bridge theorems are discussed in more detail, or to the
monographs of Czelakowski (2001), Font (2016), and Cintula &amp;
Noguera (2021).</p>

<p>
Bridge theorems are available for many other properties of logics
beyond those considered here, notably the Craig interpolation property
(see Gabbay &amp; Maksimova 2005) and the Beth definability property
(see Blok &amp; Hoogland 2006). They enable us to apply algebraic
methods to the study of these properties, as in the landmark result of
Maksimova (1977) which states that among the uncountably many
non-trivial axiomatic extensions of intuitionistic logic (the
so-called <em>intermediate logics</em>) there are exactly seven which
enjoy the Craig interpolation property (see
 <a href="../logic-algebraic-propositional/">algebraic propositional logic</a>
 for the definition of this property). For example, this property is
enjoyed by classical logic CL, by intuitionistic logic IL, by the
infinite-valued G&ouml;del logic \(\G_{\infty}\) and by the
three-valued G&ouml;del logic \(\G_{3}\), but not by \(\G_{n}\) for
\(n &gt; 3\). What Maksimova in fact did was to prove that there are
exactly seven non-trivial subvarieties of Heyting algebras with the
so-called amalgamation property and then use a bridge theorem (see
Metcalfe, Montagna, &amp; Tsinakis 2014) relating the amalgamation
property and Craig interpolation. The same approach has also been
successfully applied to normal modal logics and some families of
substructural logics (see Gabbay &amp; Maksimova 2005 and Fussner
&amp; Santchi forthcoming).</p>

<h2 id="MatrSema">3. Matrix semantics</h2>

<p>
This section introduces logical matrices as tools that occupy central
stage in the study of many-valued logics. In
 <a href="#ExplAlgeStruSent">section 3.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#LogiMatrDesiBaseNotiEnta">section 3.2</a>,
 the syntactic and the semantic roles of algebraic structures in
associating a canonical kind of semantics to a given language are
emphasized as implementing a straightforward version of
 <a href="../compositionality/">compositionality</a>
 through truth-functional means. In
 <a href="#ExprPoweManyValuLogi">section 3.3</a>,
 the finite-valued logics introduced by Post and by &#321;ukasiewicz
exemplify important types of functional expressiveness, in that their
associated algebras are, respectively, functionally complete and
pre-functionally complete; as a result, while the logics of
&#321;ukasiewicz constitute notable subclassical logics, the logics of
Post allow one to go beyond the ground covered by classical logic.
Substitution-invariant consequence relations become the next focus,
and the early uses of many-valued semantics in providing independence
proofs and maximality results are ventilated in
 <a href="#ManyValuRuleBaseAppr">section 3.4</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="ExplAlgeStruSent">3.1 Exploiting the algebraic structure of sentences</h3>

<p>
For the sake of illustration, consider in what follows the language
\(L\) given by a non-empty collection \(At\) of propositional
variables (a.k.a. <em>atomic sentences</em>) and by a propositional
signature \(\Sigma\) containing a binary symbol \(\to\) for the
implication connective and a unary symbol \(\neg\) for the negation
connective. The <em>sentences</em> (a.k.a. <em>formulas</em>) in this
language are organized into a term algebra
\(\mathbf{Fm}^{\Sigma}(At)\) (henceforth simply referred to as
\(\mathbf{Fm}_L\)), a &lsquo;purely syntactic&rsquo; structure whose
universe \({Fm}_L\) is freely generated by \(At\) over \(\Sigma\). In
practice, this means that sentences have an algebraic structure that
may be recursively exploited, say, in defining various syntactic and
semantic notions. Hereupon, all logics will be assumed to have
infinitely many variables, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, given an algebra \(\mathbf{A}\) in the same signature as
the algebra of sentences, any mapping \(\mathsf{e}\) from \(At\) into
the universe of \(\mathbf{A}\) is uniquely extendable into a
homomorphism (i.e., a structure-preserving mapping) \({h}_\mathsf{e}\)
from \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) to \(\mathbf{A}\). For instance, given a
mapping \(\mathsf{u}\colon \At\to {Fm}_L\) such that
\(\mathsf{u}(p_0)=\neg p_1\) and \(\mathsf{u}(p_1)=p_1\to p_0\), the
unique homomorphism \({\sigma}_\mathsf{u}\colon\mathbf{Fm}_L\to
\mathbf{Fm}_L\) that extends it is such that</p> 
\[
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (\neg p_0\to\neg(\neg p_1\to p_0))
&amp; = \sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (\neg p_0) \to \sigma_{\mathsf{u}}(\neg(\neg p_1\to p_0)) \\
&amp; = \neg \sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (p_0)\to \neg\sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (\neg p_1\to p_0) \\
&amp; = \neg \sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (p_0) \to \neg(\sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (\neg p_1)\to \sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (p_0)) \\
&amp; = \neg \sigma_{\mathsf{u}}(p_0) \to \neg(\neg\sigma_{\mathsf{u}}(p_1) \to \sigma_{\mathsf{u}} (p_0)) \\
&amp;  = \neg\mathsf{u} (p_0)\to\neg(\neg \mathsf{u}(p_1)\to \mathsf{u} (p_0))   \\
&amp; = \neg \neg p_1\to\neg(\neg (p_1\to p_0)\to \neg p_1).
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
Such endomorphisms of \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) are called
<em>substitutions</em>.</p>

<p>
To describe now, as a specific example, an interpretation for
classical logic, consider the algebra \(\mathbf{B}_{\CL}\) with
universe \(B=\{0,1\}\) (the set of &lsquo;truth values&rsquo;) and
containing the operations \(\to^{\mathbf{B}_{\CL}}\) and
\(\neg^{\mathbf{B}_{\CL}}\) such that \(x\to^{\mathbf{B}_{\CL}}y=0\)
iff \(x=1\) and \(y=0\), and \(\neg^{\mathbf{B}_{\CL}}x=0\) iff
\(x=1\). In general, the <em>canonical semantics</em> \(\mathbf{Sem}\)
for \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) associated to an algebra \(\mathbf{A}\) will be
given by the collection \(\Hom(\mathbf{Fm}_L,\mathbf{A})\) of all
homomorphisms from \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) to \(\mathbf{A}\). For an example
taking \(\mathbf{A}\) as \(\mathbf{B}_{\CL}\), given a mapping
\(\mathsf{a}\colon \At\to {B}\) (a so-called <em>atomic truth
assignment</em>) such that \(\mathsf{a}(p_0)=0=\mathsf{a}(p_1)\), the
unique \(v_\mathsf{a}\in\Hom(\mathbf{Fm}_L,\mathbf{A})\) that extends
\(\mathsf{a}\) is such that</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
  v_{\mathsf{a}}(\neg p_0\to\neg(\neg p_1\to p_0))  
&amp; =  {v}_{\mathsf{a}}(\neg p_0) \to^{\mathbf{A}} v_{\mathsf{a}}(\neg(\neg p_1\to p_0))\\
&amp; =  \ldots\\
&amp; =  \neg^{\mathbf{A}} v_{\mathsf{a}}(p_0) \to^{\mathbf{A}}\neg^{\mathbf{A}}(\neg^{\mathbf{A}} v_{\mathsf{a}}(p_1)\to^{\mathbf{A}} v_{\mathsf{a}}(p_0))\\
&amp; = \neg^{\mathbf{A}} \mathsf{a}(p_0) \to^{\mathbf{A}} \neg^{\mathbf{A}} (\neg^{\mathbf{A}} \mathsf{a}(p_1) \to^{\mathbf{A}} \mathsf{a}(p_0))\\
&amp; = \neg^{\mathbf{A}} 0 \to^{\mathbf{A}} \neg^{\mathbf{A}} (\neg^{\mathbf{A}} 0 \to^{\mathbf{A}} 0)\\
&amp; =  1 \to^{\mathbf{A}} \neg^{\mathbf{A}}(1\to^{\mathbf{A}} 0)\\
&amp; =  1\to^\mathbf{A}\neg^\mathbf{A}0\\
&amp; =  1 \to^{\mathbf{A}} 1\\
&amp; =  1.\\
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
Such kinds of homomorphisms extending atomic truth assignments so as
to cover the whole set of sentences are called
\(\mathbf{A}\)-<em>valuations</em>.</p>

<p>
While valuations provide a natural class of interpretations
accommodating for the underlying structures of the sentences, the
notion of &lsquo;truth-functionality of a connective&rsquo; may in
fact be relativized to other classes of truth assignments, as
discussed in
 <a href="../connectives-logic/">the entry on sentence connectives in formal logic</a>.
 At any rate, there is a clear sense in which a canonical semantics
may be called <em>compositional</em> (and even
<em>truth-functional</em>): just observe that the meaning (namely, the
truth value) assigned to any given sentence, according to a given
valuation, functionally depends on the meaning (namely, the truth
value) of its immediate syntactic components and on the mode of
combination given by the operation interpreting its main connective.
In our present illustration, the language \(L\), as interpreted by the
algebra \(\mathbf{B}_{\CL}\), turns out to be very expressive: any
\(m\)-ary operation on \(B\), for \(m&gt;0\), may be described by some
appropriate sentence containing \(m\) propositional variables; this
corresponds to (a weak form of) a purely algebraic property known as
<em>functional completeness</em>.</p>

<h3 id="LogiMatrDesiBaseNotiEnta">3.2 Logical matrices and the designation-based notion of entailment</h3>

<p>
So far we have looked at several algebras, but no &lsquo;logic&rsquo;
is yet in sight. Consider now a <em>logical matrix</em>
\(\mathcal{M}\) for the language \(L\) as a structure
\(\langle\mathbf{A},D\rangle,\) where \(\mathbf{A}\) is an algebra
with a (non-empty) universe \(V\) of &lsquo;truth values&rsquo;, such
as the one illustrated above, and the set \(D\) of <em>designated
values</em> is a subset of \(V\); the set \(U\) of <em>undesignated
values</em> corresponds to \(V\setminus D\) (see &#321;ukasiewicz
&amp; Tarski 1930). <em>Designation-based</em> notions of
<em>entailment</em>, or <em>validity</em>, may be defined with the
help of a logical matrix and the canonical semantics associated to it
as soon as one chooses a particular syntactic framework to work on.
For instance, if one chooses the so-called <em><span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
framework</em> (see Shoesmith &amp; Smiley
1978) and considers a &lsquo;multiple-conclusion&rsquo;
<em>consecution</em> (a.k.a. <em>inference</em>) to be a pair
\((\Pi,\Sigma)\) of sets of sentences, one may say that
\(\Pi\vdash_\mathcal{M}\Sigma\) (&ldquo;\(\Sigma\) <em>follows
from</em> \(\Pi\), according to \(\mathcal{M}\)&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;<em>\((\Pi,\Sigma)\) is \(\mathcal{M}\)-valid</em>&rdquo;) if
there is no \(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\) for which \(v[\Pi]\subseteq
D\) and \(v[\Sigma]\subseteq U\). According to such notion of
entailment, &ldquo;no individual valuation makes all sentences in
\(\Pi\) true and all sentences in \(\Sigma\) false&rdquo;;
alternatively, this may also be read as saying that &ldquo;for each
individual valuation, some sentence in \(\Pi\) is false or some
sentence in \(\Sigma\) is true&rdquo;. In particular, a tautology of
the logic induced by \(\mathcal{M}\) is a sentence \(\varphi\) such
that \(v(\varphi)\in D\) for every \(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\)
(&ldquo;\(\varphi\) is always true&rdquo;); equivalently,
tautologicality may be established by checking whether
\(v(\varphi)\not\in U\) for every \(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\)
(&ldquo;\(\varphi\) is never false&rdquo;). In a bilateralist reading
(see Rumfitt 2000; Wansing &amp; Ayhan 2023), affirming that
\(\Sigma\) follows from \(\Pi\) means that asserting all sentences in
\(\Pi\) implies not denying all sentences in \(\Sigma\);
alternatively, it also means that denying all sentences in \(\Sigma\)
implies not asserting all sentences in \(\Pi\). The designation-based
notion of entailment subsumes as special cases the assertional logic
and the anti-assertional logic (recall
 <a href="#TwoThreTrutValuGapsGlut">section 2.2</a>).
 To obtain the assertional and the anti-assertional logic of an
algebra \(\mathbf{A}\) relative to some constants 1 and 0, one takes
\(D = \{ 1 \}\) and \(D = V \setminus \{ 0 \}\), respectively.</p>

<p>
So defined, it is easy to verify that entailment amounts to a
<em>generalized consequence relation</em> (<span class="sc">GCR</span>),
that is, the following clauses are respected
when we take \(\vdash\) as \(\vdash_\mathcal{M}\):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>[M]</dt>
<dd>if \(\Pi\vdash\Sigma\), then
\(\Pi^\prime\cup\Pi\vdash\Sigma\cup\Sigma^\prime\)</dd>
<dt>[R]</dt>
<dd>if \({\Pi}\) intersects \({\Sigma}\), then
\(\Pi\vdash\Sigma\)</dd>
<dt>[T]</dt>
<dd>if
\(\Delta^\prime\cup\Pi\vdash\Sigma\cup(\Delta\setminus\Delta^\prime)\)
for every \(\Delta^\prime\subseteq\Delta\), then
\(\Pi\vdash\Sigma\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Following Scott (1974), we call those conditions M, R and T,
considering that they generalize the Tarskian conditions of
Monotonicity, Reflexivity and Transitivity (see Tarski 1956). In
Shoesmith and Smiley (1978), these conditions are called Dilution,
Overlap, and Cut (for sets). In the case of finitary GCRs, the last
condition is equivalent to:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>[T\(_{\mathrm{fin}}\)]</dt>
<dd>if \(\Pi \vdash \Sigma, \varphi\) and \(\varphi, \Pi \vdash
\Sigma\), then \(\Pi \vdash \Sigma\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The proof-theoretically-minded reader will no doubt recognize the
latter condition as one of the incarnations of the Cut rule in sequent
calculi for classical logic.</p>

<p>
For the well-known case of classical logic, one may consider the
algebra \(\mathbf{B}_{\CL}\), as in the previous section, and fix
\(D=\{1\}\). Note that, in the <span class="sc">GCR</span> \(\vdash\)
associated to the corresponding logical matrix, \(\mathcal{M}_{\CL}\),
with its canonical semantics, the statement \(\{p_0\to
p_1,p_1\}\vdash\{p_0\}\) fails to hold, while \(\{\}\vdash\{p_0\to
p_0\}\) and \(\{\}\vdash\{p_0\to p_1,p_1\to p_0\}\) both hold good.
This means, of course, that \(p_0\to p_0\) is classically valid, and
that the consecution \((\{\},\{p_0\to p_1,p_1\to p_0\})\) is
classically valid, while the consecution \((\{p_0\to p_1,p_1\},\{
p_0\})\) is not classically valid. It is worth noting that, if one
chooses the so-called <em><span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span>
framework</em> and constrains \(\Sigma\) to be a singleton
\(\{\varphi\}\), the corresponding &lsquo;single-conclusion&rsquo;
consecutions of the form \((\Pi,\varphi)\) define a <em>consequence
relation</em> (<span class="sc">CR</span>) by stipulating that
\(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}}\varphi\) (&ldquo;\(\varphi\) <em>follows
from \(\Pi\), according to \(\mathcal{M}\)</em>&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;<em>\((\Pi,\varphi)\) is \(\mathcal{M}\)-valid</em>&rdquo;) if
there is no \(\mathcal{M}\)-valuation \(v\) for which
\(v[\Pi]\subseteq D\) and \(v[\{\varphi\}]\subseteq U\); equivalently,
one may say that \(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}}\varphi\) if
\(v[\Pi]\subseteq D\) implies \(v(\varphi)\in D\) for every
\(\mathcal{M}\)-valuation \(v\). This naturally gives rise to the
well-known <em>preservation-based</em> notion of entailment, according
to which affirming that \(\varphi\) follows from \(\Pi\) means that
&ldquo;the sentence \(\varphi\) is true whenever the sentences in
\(\Pi\) are true&rdquo;; in other words, asserting all sentences in
\(\Pi\) implies asserting \(\varphi\). It is easy to see that <span class="sc">CR</span>s
respect the following straightforward
specializations of the preceding clauses:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>\([M']\)</dt>
<dd>if \(\Pi\vdash\varphi\), then
\(\Pi^\prime\cup\Pi\vdash\varphi\)</dd>
<dt>\([R']\)</dt>
<dd>if \(\varphi\in{\Pi}\), then \(\Pi\vdash\varphi\)</dd>
<dt>\([T']\)</dt>
<dd>if \(\Pi \vdash \delta\) for every \(\delta \in \Delta\) and
\(\Delta \vdash \varphi\), then \(\Pi \vdash \varphi\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note that, under the conjunctive reading of conclusion sets (recall
 <a href="#Clas2ValuLogi">section 2.1</a>),
 this last condition is a straightforward expression of transitivity:
if \(\Pi \vdash^{\amp} \Delta\) and \(\Delta \vdash^{\amp} \Sigma\),
then \(\Pi \vdash^{\amp} \Sigma\).</p>

<p>
A <em>logic</em> \(\langle\mathbf{Fm}_L,\vdash_{\mathcal{M}}\rangle\)
<em>induced by</em> a logical matrix \({\mathcal{M}}\), following one
of the above designation-based recipes, will be said to be
<em>determined</em> by the canonical semantics associated to
\(\mathcal{M}\). In view of the above, insofar as logics should be
concerned with &lsquo;consequence&rsquo;, the designation-based notion
of entailment associated to a logical matrix and its canonical
semantics is one way to go, as it introduces a natural notion of
validity that applies to the appropriate consecution describing
what-follows-from-what.</p>

<p>
The idea of a logic admitting a <em>truth-functional semantics</em> is
commonly equated to the logic being determined by the canonical
semantics associated to some logical matrix, whose underlying algebra
is said to provide a <em>truth-tabular</em> interpretation for the
connectives. Accordingly, for any such a logic, an intuitive
realization of &lsquo;many-valuedness&rsquo; consists in calling the
logic <em>\(\kappa\)-valued</em> if \(\kappa\) is the cardinality of
the set of truth values underlying the given logical matrix; when
\(\kappa\) is finite, the logic may be called <em>finite-valued</em>.
Given that algebras of truth values lie at the heart of logical
matrices, we shall recall in what follows some well-known general
results concerning such algebras and some of the logics that originate
from them.</p>

<h3 id="ExprPoweManyValuLogi">3.3 The expressive power of many-valued logics</h3>

<p>
Being two-valued is not exclusive to classical logic. Consider the
purely implicative fragment of our main illustration from the previous
section (namely, for the originally given algebra of sentences, we
consider the reduct thereof to the language containing the symbol for
implication but not the one for negation). Keeping the interpretation
of implication as before, the resulting two-valued logic is no longer
functionally complete: there is no way, in particular, to define
within the new logical matrix an operation emulating the behavior that
negation had in the original logical matrix. Necessary and sufficient
criteria for an arbitrary set of two-valued operations to be
functionally complete were provided by Emil Post (1941; see Pelletier
&amp; Martin 1990), who also supplied a full description of the
countably infinite lattice of two-valued clones (that is, the
collections of two-valued finitary operations containing all
projections and closed under composition) ordered by inclusion. On
what concerns the two-valued logics associated to logical matrices
with a single designated value, corresponding to the clones in
Post&rsquo;s lattice, Wolfgang Rautenberg (1981) has shown how to
produce Hilbert-style axiomatizations for each of them.</p>

<p>
Very early in the course of the contemporary history of many-valued
logics, the problem of describing, for each finite \(\kappa\), a
functionally complete \(\kappa\)-element algebra
\(\mathbf{P}_\kappa\), was also fully solved by Post (1921), who
actually introduced, based on those algebras, logical matrices
\(\mathcal{P}_\kappa^\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is the cardinality
of the set of designated values. General criteria for the functional
completeness of arbitrary collections of \(\kappa\)-valued operations,
for any fixed \(\kappa\), and procedures for the axiomatization of the
associated logics were proposed by Jerzy S&#322;upecki (1939).
However, in contrast to the two-valued case, the structure of the
lattices of \(\kappa\)-valued clones, for \(\kappa&gt;2\), is known to
be quite intricate, and in particular not countable (see Lau
2006).</p>

<p>
Consider propositional languages \(L_a\) and \(L_b\) interpreted,
respectively, over the algebras \(\mathbf{A}_a\) and \(\mathbf{A}_b\)
sharing the same universe \(V\). We say that \(\mathbf{A}_a\) and
\(\mathbf{A}_b\) are <em>term-equivalent</em> if each \(m\)-ary
operation of \(\mathbf{A}_b\) can be obtained as the interpretation of
some \(m\)-place sentence from \(\mathbf{Fm}_{L_a}\) (an algebraist
would say: an \(m\)-ary term), and analogously for the operations of
\(\mathbf{A}_a\) and appropriate sentences from \(\mathbf{Fm}_{L_b}\).
This means that every connective interpreted by a primitive operation
of one of these algebras is interpretable by a derived operation of
the other algebra. Two term-equivalent algebras may thus be understood
as being essentially the same, up to the choice of primitive
operations. Given two term-equivalent algebras \(\mathbf{A}_a\) and
\(\mathbf{A}_b\) equipped with a shared set \(D\) of designated
values, we say that the logics induced by the matrices
\(\langle\mathbf{A}_a,D\rangle\) and \(\langle\mathbf{A}_b,D\rangle\)
are <em>definitionally equivalent</em>. This will mean that such
logics might be thought of as being two <em>versions</em> of the same
logic, as any valid consecution of one of these logics may be
converted via syntactic manipulations into a valid consecution of the
other logic. For most practical purposes, in the present entry, we
shall find little reason to distinguish between term-equivalent
algebras, or to distinguish between definitionally equivalent
logics.</p>

<p>
Given the logical matrices
\(\mathcal{M}_a=\langle\mathbf{A}_a,D_a\rangle\) and
\(\mathcal{M}_b=\langle\mathbf{A}_b,D_b\rangle\) interpreting the same
propositional signature, we say that \(\mathcal{M}_a\) is a
<em>submatrix</em> of \(\mathcal{M}_b\) if \(\mathbf{A}_a\) is a
subalgebra of \(\mathbf{A}_b\) and \(D_a=V_a\cap D_b\) (where \(V_a\),
we recall, is the universe of \(\mathbf{A}_a\)). This clearly implies
that all \(\mathcal{M}_b\)-valid consecutions are
\(\mathcal{M}_a\)-valid. Accordingly, recall from
 <a href="#TrueFalsNeitBoth">section 2.3</a>
 that we also say, in this case, that the logic \(\L_b\) induced by
\(\mathbf{A}_b\) is a sublogic of the logic \(\L_a\) induced by
\(\mathbf{A}_a\); additionally, recall from
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>
 that we call subclassical any sublogic of a definitionally equivalent
version of classical logic. For a simple example of a subclassical
logic, consider the logical matrix \(\mathcal{N}_1\) having
\(\{0,\star,1\}\) as the set of truth values, and assume that 0 is its
only undesignated value. On top of that, consider an algebra
\(\mathbf{N}_1\) that interprets implication and negation by
setting:</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
    x \to^{\mathbf{N}_1} y &amp;  = \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; \text{if either}\ x \neq 1\ \text{or}\ y = 1 \\
    0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\\
    \neg^{\mathbf{N}_1} x &amp; = \begin{cases}
        1 &amp; \text{if}\ x \neq 1 \\ 
        0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
As the submatrix of \(\mathcal{N}_1\) with the universe \(\{0,1\}\) is
the matrix \(\mathcal{M}_{\CL}\) which induces classical logic, every
\(\mathcal{N}_1\)-valid consecution is classically valid. In fact, in
this particular example, it is also the case that all classical
tautologies are valid according to \(\mathcal{N}_1\); however, there
are classically valid consecutions, such as \((\{p_1\},\{\neg\neg
p_1\})\), that fail to be valid according to the designation-based
entailment relation associated to \(\mathcal{N}_1\).</p>

<p>
Given two propositional signatures \(\Sigma_a\) and \(\Sigma_b\) such
that \(\Sigma_a\subseteq\Sigma_b\), interpreted, respectively, by the
logical matrices \(\mathcal{M}_a=\langle\mathbf{A}_a,D_a\rangle\) and
\(\mathcal{M}_b=\langle\mathbf{A}_b,D_b\rangle\), a <em>weak matrix
homomorphism</em> from \(\mathcal{M}_b\) to \(\mathcal{M}_a\) is a
surjective mapping \(h\colon{V}_b\to{V}_a\) such that: (i)
\(h({\copyright^{\mathbf{A}_b}}(x_1,\ldots,x_m))={\copyright^{\mathbf{A}_a}}(h(x_1),\ldots,h(x_m))\)
for every \(m\)-place connective \(\copyright\) in \(\Sigma_a\) (that
is, a homomorphism from the appropriate reduct of \(\mathbf{A}_b\) to
\(\mathbf{A}_a\)), and (ii) \(h(x)\in D_a\) whenever \(x\in D_b\). If
the converse of (ii) also holds, we say that \(h\) is a <em>strong
matrix homomorphism</em> (a.k.a. <em>strict homomorphism</em>). Let
\(\L_a\) and \(\L_b\) be the logics induced, respectively, by
\(\mathcal{M}_a\) and \(\mathcal{M}_b\). Then, it is easy to see that,
over the language induced by \(\Sigma_a\), the existence of a weak
matrix homomorphism from \(\mathcal{M}_b\) to \(\mathcal{M}_a\)
guarantees that all valid sentences of \(\L_b\) are valid sentences of
\(\L_a\), while the existence of a strong matrix homomorphism in the
same direction guarantees that \(\L_a\) and \(\L_b\) share the same
set of valid consecutions. For an example of the latter situation,
define a logical matrix \(\mathcal{N}_2\) that sets \(\{a,b,c\}\) as
the universe of an algebra \(\mathbf{N}_2\), take \(c\) as the only
undesignated value, and interpret implication and negation by the
following truth tables:</p>

<div class="avoid-break" style="display:flex; justify-content: center">

<p>
It is easy to check that the mapping that sets \(h(a)=h(b)=1\) and
\(h(c)=0\) provides a strong matrix homomorphism from
\(\mathcal{N}_2\) to \(\mathcal{M}_{\CL}\), and it follows that the
logic induced by \(\mathcal{N}_2\) has the same set of valid
consecutions as classical logic.</p>

<p>
Given a logic \(\L\) induced by a logical matrix
\(\mathcal{M}=\langle\mathbf{A},D\rangle\), we shall say that we are
dealing with a <em>fragment</em> of \(\L\) in case some connectives
are dropped from its underlying signature and all remaining
connectives are interpreted exactly as they originally were, in
\(\mathcal{M}\) (so, we are taking reducts of both the algebra of
sentences and the algebra of truth values). As a side-effect of the
compositional character of logics induced by logical matrices, if
\(\langle\mathbf{Fm}_{L^\prime},\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^\prime}\rangle\)
is a fragment of \(\langle\mathbf{Fm}_L,\vdash_{\mathcal{M}}\rangle\),
then the latter logic is a <em>conservative expansion</em> of the
former logic, that is, the \(\mathcal{M}^\prime\)-valid consecutions
coincide with the \(\mathcal{M}\)-valid consecutions over the smaller
language. This is a remarkable case in which expanding the language of
a given logic never affects the inferences deemed to be valid before
the said expansion was performed.</p>

<p>
Because the finite algebras described by Post are functionally
complete, every logic induced by a finite-valued logical matrix may be
thought of as a fragment of some of the logics induced by the logical
matrices \(\mathcal{P}_\kappa^\lambda\). Some other such fragments
also deserve notice. Consider an \(m\)-ary operation \(f_a\) on a
domain \(V_a\) and an \(m\)-ary operation \(f_b\) on a domain \(V_b\)
such that \(V_a\subseteq V_b\). In case the two operations coincide on
all \(m\)-tuples of elements from \(V_a\) (that is,
\(f_b{\restriction_{V_a}}=f_a\)), we shall say that \(f_b\)
<em>generalizes</em> \(f_a\). In particular, for each finite
\(\kappa\geq 2\), Jan &#321;ukasiewicz introduced in the 1920s (see
&#321;ukasiewicz 1970), \(\kappa\)-element algebras
\(\mathbf{L}_\kappa\), for \(\kappa\geq 2\), that allow for all
generalizations of \(\{0,1\}\)-valued operations to be explicitly
defined: typically, the universe of \(\mathbf{L}_\kappa\), for each
finite \(\kappa\geq 2\), is taken to be the set
\(\{0,\frac{1}{\kappa-1},\ldots,\frac{\kappa-2}{\kappa-1},1\}\),
implication is interpreted by setting
\(x\to^\mathbf{L}y=\min(1,1-x+y)\) and negation is interpreted by
setting \(\neg^\mathbf{L}x=1-x\), while a disjunction \(p_1\lor p_2\)
is defined as \((p_1\to p_2)\to p_2\) and a conjunction \(p_1\land
p_2\) is defined as \(\neg(\neg p_1\lor\neg p_2)\). It is worth
pointing out that each \(\mathbf{L}_\kappa\), for \(\kappa&gt;2\), is
<em>pre-functionally complete</em>, in the sense that the algebra
becomes functionally complete as soon as one expands it by any
\(\kappa\)-valued operation that does not generalize a
\(\{0,1\}\)-valued operation. Note also that classical logic is
induced either by Post&rsquo;s logical matrix \(\mathcal{P}_2^1\) or
by &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s logical matrix
\(\mathcal{L}_2^1=\langle\mathbf{L}_2,\{1\}\rangle\). By the same
token, &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s logical matrices
\(\mathcal{L}_\kappa^1\), for each \(\kappa&gt;2\), are defined using
the same set of designated values as \(\mathcal{L}_2^1\). This makes
it clear, in particular, that each of the associated logics is
subclassical. In fact, if we use \(\L_\eta\) to refer to the logic
induced by \(\mathcal{L}_\eta^1\), it is easy to check, by the
construction of the corresponding (sub)matrices, that \(\L_\lambda\)
is a sublogic of \(\L_\kappa\) iff \(\kappa-1\) divides \(\lambda-1\).
&#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s \(\L_{3}\) has been axiomatized by Mordchaj
Wajsberg (1931); a general method for axiomatizing the \(\L_\kappa\),
for finite \(\kappa\), taking advantage of their functional
expressiveness, was introduced by Rosser and Turquette (1945).</p>

<p>
Although &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s logics, along with most
(many-valued) logics in the literature, can be viewed as sublogics of
fragments of the functionally complete two-valued logic, Post&rsquo;s
\(\kappa\)-valued logics, for \(\kappa&gt;2\), may be seen as proper
expansions of classical logic, allowing for certain expressive
limitations of the latter to be transcended. Indeed, each algebra
\(\mathbf{P}_\kappa\) allows in particular for the definition of a
1-ary cyclic operation \(\circlearrowright\) such that
\(\circlearrowright^\mu\) (namely, the \(\mu\)-iterated composition of
\(\circlearrowright\) with itself) is the identity mapping iff \(\mu\)
is a multiple of \(\kappa\). From the logical viewpoint, this implies
that the connective interpreted by \(\circlearrowright\) is involutive
with period \(\kappa\) but not involutive with any period
\(2\lt\mu\lt\kappa\). However, by the pigeonhole principle, such
connectives cannot exist in logics induced by logical matrices whose
underlying algebras contain less than \(\kappa\) elements. It follows
that, if we use \(\mathrm{P}_\kappa^\lambda\) to refer to the logic
induced by the logical matrix \(\mathcal{P}_\kappa^\lambda\), the
logic \(\mathrm{P}_\mu^\lambda\) is not a sublogic of
\(\mathrm{P}_{\nu}^\lambda\) for any \(\nu\lt\mu\); in particular,
none of Post&rsquo;s logics \(\mathrm{P}_\kappa^\lambda\), for
\(\kappa&gt;2\), is subclassical. Note, indeed, that there are only
two 1-ary cyclic two-valued operations, and these correspond to the
interpretation of the classical connectives for negation and
affirmation (the latter being the connective interpreted by the
identity mapping); there is, for that reason, no classical connective
\(\copyright\) such that \(p_1\) and \(\copyright p_1\) and
\(\copyright\copyright p_1\) are pairwise inequivalent, while \(p_1\)
is equivalent to \(\copyright\copyright\copyright p_1\) (yet such
connective is of course definable, say, in \(\mathrm{P}_3^1\)).</p>

<p>
The above illustration evidences that many-valuedness allows for the
definition of logics that really deviate from classical logic, as such
logics may happen to validate consecutions that have no classical
counterpart. As another illustration, the logic of conditional
negation presented by Cantwell (2008) is characterized by a
three-valued matrix, but it is contraclassical, given that it accepts
formulas of the form \(\bot \to A\) and their negations \(\neg(\bot
\to A)\) as theorems without being trivial (see
 <a href="../logic-connexive/">the entry on connexive logic</a>
 and also
 <a href="../logic-conditionals/">the entry on the logic of conditionals</a>
 for more on this logic and related systems).</p>

<h3 id="ManyValuRuleBaseAppr">3.4 Many-valuedness and rule-based approaches</h3>

<p>
Here is one way in which the &lsquo;formal&rsquo; character of the
logical notion of consequence is often claimed to be captured. Notice,
first, that any canonical semantics \(\Hom(\mathbf{Fm}_L,\mathbf{A})\)
is <em>closed for substitutions</em>, that is, if \(v\) is an
\(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation and \(\sigma\) is a substitution on
\(\mathbf{Fm}_L\), then also \(v\circ\sigma\) is an
\(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation. If we fix some logical matrix
\(\mathcal{M}\) based on \(\mathbf{A}\) and consider the logic
\(\langle\mathbf{Fm}_L,\vdash_\mathcal{M}\rangle\) induced by it, it
is then clear that the following clause is respected, when we take
\(\vdash\) as \(\vdash_\mathcal{M}\):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<p>
The converse also holds, that is, given a collection \(\mathbf{Sem}\)
of valuations and a designation-based entailment relation
\(\vdash_\mathbf{Sem}\) induced by it, if \(\vdash_\mathbf{Sem}\)
satisfies [SI], then \(\mathbf{Sem}\) is closed for substitutions. A
(generalized) consequence relation respecting [SI] will be called
<em>substitution-invariant</em>. (We concur with Humberstone 2011:
1.23 in finding it advisable to avoid the original terminology for
this property, namely &lsquo;structural&rsquo; [see &#321;o&#347;
&amp; Suszko 1958], due to other common current usages for the latter
terminology in the logic literature.)</p>

<p>
Substitution-invariant consequence relations have traditionally been
studied, in the literature, by way of deductive systems based on
customary notions of formal derivation (see the entry on
 <a href="../proof-theory/">Proof Theory</a>).
 A consecution, according to such a system, may be read as a
(<em>schematic</em>) <em>rule</em>. For instance, the rule of
&lsquo;modus ponens&rsquo; refers to all the <em>substitution
instances</em> \((\{\sigma(p_0\to
p_1),\sigma(p_0)\},\{\sigma(p_1)\})\) of the consecution \((\{p_0\to
p_1,p_0\},\{p_1\})\), and it is commonly written instead as
\(\infer{\varphi_1}{\varphi_0\to \varphi_1, \varphi_0}\), omitting
braces and using meta-variables rather than the original propositional
variables from the object language. A <em>rule-based</em>
(&lsquo;Hilbert-style&rsquo;) <em>calculus</em> may be identified with
a collection of rules \(\mathcal{R}\); the latter induces a <span class="sc">GCR</span>
\(\vdash_\mathcal{R}\), and indeed, by adding
all the valid sentences as axioms, any <span class="sc">GCR</span> may
be seen as a rule-based calculus (see Shoesmith &amp; Smiley 1978). A
rule \(\infer{\Delta}{\Gamma}\) is said to be <em>finite</em> when
both \(\Gamma\) and \(\Delta\) are finite; a <span class="sc">GCR</span>
\(\vdash\) is called <em>finitely-based</em> if
it is induced by some finite collection of finite rules (see
W&oacute;jcicki 1988). Simple finitely-based rule-based calculi for
the four-valued logic BD
 (<a href="#TrueFalsNeitBoth">section 2.3</a>)
 exist, and any such system may be used as a basis for providing
adequate calculi for the three-valued logics \(\K_{3}\) and LP. In the
case of the latter, it suffices to add an <em>axiom</em> (a
consecution whose first projection is an empty set of sentences) of
the form \(\varphi\lor\neg\varphi\); in the case of the former, it
suffices to add an <em>anti-axiom</em> (a consecution whose second
projection is an empty set of sentences) of the form
\(\varphi\land\neg\varphi\); by simultaneously adding both to BD one
obtains a rule-based calculus for classical logic. An intuition that
lies behind these examples is that by omitting axioms one would expect
the semantics of resulting logics to &lsquo;need more truth
values&rsquo; (or to be &lsquo;less deterministic&rsquo;, in the sense
explained in
 <a href="#NonDeteSema">section 5.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
One of the earliest applications of many-valued semantics in the
literature, prior even to their being taken seriously as a way of
inducing logics on their own right, was to show independence of rules.
Indeed, as highlighted in Zach (1999), independence proofs for
axiomatic systems were introduced by Ernst Schr&ouml;der as early as
in 1890 and were mastered by Paul Bernays in his Habilitationsschrift,
in 1918 (see Schr&ouml;der 1890 and Bernays 1918). The idea is simple
to explain, once we make use of logical matrices. A rule
\(\infer{\Delta}{\Gamma}\) is said to be <em>sound</em> for a logical
matrix \(\mathcal{M}\) if \(\Gamma\vdash_\mathcal{M}\Delta\), that is,
no valuation \(v\) based on \(\mathcal{M}\) assigns designated values
to all the sentences of \(\Gamma\) and undesignated values to all the
sentences of \(\Delta\); the notion extends naturally to any
collection of rules. The converse direction, namely when every
\(\mathcal{M}\)-valid consecution is witnessed by some derivation
written in a given rule-based calculus, is called
<em>completeness</em>. To check if a certain rule \(R_0\) is
<em>independent</em> of the rules in a certain collection
\(\mathcal{R}\), it suffices to exhibit a logical matrix for which
\(\mathcal{R}\) is sound while \(R_0\) is not sound. For an example,
given any of the usual rule-based calculi for classical logic, there
will be some rule&mdash;say, axioms of the form
\((\gamma\to(\alpha\to\beta))\to((\gamma\to\alpha)\to(\gamma\to\beta))\)
or \((\alpha\to(\alpha\to\beta))\to(\alpha\to\beta)\)&mdash;that will
be sound for the logical matrix for classical logic while being
unsound for the logical matrix of &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s \(\L_{3}\);
and this means that the latter matrix can be used to show that the
said axioms are independent of any other sound axioms or rules that
might be present in a complete calculus for classical logic. This does
not mean, of course, that once such independent rules are deleted the
remaining rules will be complete for \(\L_{3}\).</p>

<p>
In a logical matrix in which all truth values are designated, all
consecutions of the form \((\Phi,\{\varphi\})\) are valid; we may call
<em>assertion-trivial</em> the logic induced by such a structure.
Analogously, in a logical matrix in which all truth values are
undesignated all consecutions of the form \((\{\varphi\},\Phi)\) are
valid; we may call <em>denial-trivial</em> the logic induced by such a
structure. Whichever logical matrix \(\mathcal{M}\) happens to be
chosen, the <span class="sc">GCR</span> \(\vdash_{\mathcal{M}}\)
induced by it is never <em>absolutely trivial</em> (in the sense of
validating each and every consecution); consequently, rule-based
calculi that are sound with respect to a semantics given in terms of a
non-empty collection of logical matrices are never inconsistent in the
sense of allowing all rules to be derived. Classical logic (namely,
&#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s \(\L_2\), or Post&rsquo;s \(\mathrm{P}_2\))
may be said to be maximal with respect to the assertion-trivial logic
(a property a.k.a. &lsquo;Post-completeness&rsquo;), in the sense that
classical logic becomes assertion-trivial once one adds any
independent new axiom to a sound and complete rule-based calculus for
it. A finer notion of maximality applies to sound and complete
rule-based calculi for &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s \(\L_{3}\): adding to
them as an axiom any sentence that is unsound in the logical matrix
for classical logic turns them into an assertion-trivial logic; adding
to them as an axiom any theorem of classical logic that is unsound in
the logical matrix for \(\L_{3}\) makes the latter logic collapse into
classical logic itself, in terms of the consecutions that are valid in
the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework. The very same
maximality results apply, in fact, to any finite-valued logic
\(\L_\kappa\) among the systems introduced by &#321;ukasiewicz, as
long as \(\kappa-1\) is a prime number (see Rose 1952).</p>

<p>
This much for logics presented in terms of Hilbert-style rules, be
they analytic (namely, by taking advantage of some kind of
&lsquo;subformula property&rsquo; in building proofs) or not. As for a
uniform approach to the matter, it is worth observing that any logic
determined by a finite logical matrix is axiomatizable by a calculus
in the <span class="sc">Set-Set</span> framework (see Shoesmith &amp;
Smiley 1978); moreover, as soon as some additional simple
expressiveness requirements are satisfied, an algorithm is in fact
available to produce analytic axiomatizations to all such logics (see
Marcelino &amp; Caleiro 2021 and Caleiro &amp; Marcelino 2019 for
general results that apply also to non-deterministic logical
matrices&mdash;for the latter, check
 <a href="#NonDeteSema">section 5.1</a>).
 Clearly, given a particular many-valued logic, certain specific
choices of proof-theoretical formalisms might be more or less
appealing&mdash;or useful&mdash;in capturing aspects of interest of
its behavior.</p>

<p>
Basic general references concerning automated reasoning with
many-valued logics are H&auml;hnle (1994) and Baaz, Ferm&uuml;ller,
and Salzer (2001); other basic and instructive references on
automatically dealing with the finite-valued cases are Zach (1993);
Carnielli (1987); Caleiro, Marcos, and Volpe (2015); Avron, Arieli,
and Zamansky (2018); and Greati, Greco, Marcelino, Palmigiano, and
Rivieccio (forthcoming). As for objective metalogical reasons for a
logic to even deserve being called &lsquo;many-valued&rsquo;, check

<h2 id="AbstCharManyValu">4. An abstract characterization of many-valuedness</h2>

<p>
The present section surveys some general results concerning the
consequence-theoretic description of logics induced by logical
matrices. We point out in
 <a href="#WhicLogiAdmiTrutFuncChar">section 4.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#WhenLogiFiniValu">section 4.2</a>
 that while every logic turns out to be characterizable by some class
of logical matrices, additional properties of consequence relations
may be used to identify logics characterized by a single matrix, as
well as to identify finite-valued logics. Such characterization
results play an important role in discussing which logics admit
truth-functional semantics. Following the so-called
&lsquo;Suszko&rsquo;s Thesis&rsquo;, and capitalizing on the two-sided
distinction between designated and undesignated sets of truth values,
we see in
 <a href="#ManyValuLogiActuBiva">section 4.3</a>
 that all many-valued logics may in fact be given bivalent
characterizations. Such bivalent reductions of many-valued semantics
typically yield alternative non-truth-functional semantics for the
same logics. In the same vein, in
 <a href="#Supe">section 4.4</a>,
 we discuss supervaluations, which can be thought of as kinds of
non-truth-functional trivaluations, and we clarify their relation to
Boolean valuations.</p>

<h3 id="WhicLogiAdmiTrutFuncChar">4.1 Which logics admit a truth-functional characterization?</h3>

<p>
Some general results concerning the consequence-theoretic
characterization of logics induced by logical matrices merit being
surveyed. To begin with, it is worth pointing out that <em>the
intersection of substitution-invariant <span class="sc">GCR</span>s is
a substitution-invariant <span class="sc">GCR</span></em>. Clearly, a
sound and complete semantics for the logic corresponding to such an
intersection is given by the union of the semantics for the individual
logics involved, using the designation-based notion of entailment.
This seems to call for a more inclusive notion of
&lsquo;many-valuedness&rsquo;, in which a logic is said to be
<em>characterized by a class of logical matrices</em> over some fixed
language. We already saw this in
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>,
 where the basic fuzzy logic BL was characterized by a family of
matrices over the universe \([0, 1]\), in contrast to infinite-valued
&#321;ukasiewicz and G&ouml;del logics, which were characterized by a
single matrix over this universe. A different kind of example is
provided by logics of order (recall
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>),
 where one considers the family of all matrices based on an algebra
\(\mathbf{A}\) and having sets of designated values that are closed
upward in the given order on \(\mathbf{A}\). However, such an approach
might appear to be too encompassing, in view of the following fact:
\(\langle\text{LM1}\rangle\) <em>Every logic based on a
substitution-invariant <span class="sc">GCR</span> is characterized by
some class of logical matrices</em>. It is worth noticing that the
typical proof of \(\langle\text{LM1}\rangle\) (see W&oacute;jcicki
1988: ch. 4, for the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework, and
see Blasio, Marcos, &amp; Wansing 2017; Chemla &amp;
&Eacute;gr&eacute; 2019 for the <span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
framework) makes use of a class of logical matrices based on a fixed
algebra; in fact, the logical matrices involved in the proof differ at
most in their sets of designated values.</p>

<p>
The excessive generality of \(\langle\text{LM1}\rangle\) justifies the
search for conditions describing logics characterizable by a class
made up of a single matrix. Now, this is how it has been achieved, for
consequence relations. Given a logic
\(\L=\langle\mathbf{Fm}_L,\vdash\rangle\), say that two sets of
sentences from \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) are <em>disconnected</em> if the
members of each one of these sets contain no propositional variables
occurring in the members of the other set, and say that a set \(\Psi\)
of sentences from \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) is <em>\(\L\)-trivializing</em> if
\(\Psi\vdash\psi\) for every sentence \(\psi\). Consider next the
following <em>cancellation</em> condition:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag8em">
<dt>[Cancellation]</dt>
<dd>if \(\bigcup_{k\in K}\Delta_k\cup\Pi\vdash\varphi\), then
\(\Pi\vdash\varphi\)
<br />
whenever all sets of sentences from the family \(\{\Delta_k\}_{k\in
K}\)
<br />
are pairwise disconnected,
<br />
no \(\Delta_k\) is \(\L\)-trivializing, and
<br />
each \(\Delta_k\) is also disconnected from
\(\Pi\cup\{\varphi\}\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is meant to capture the &lsquo;compositional&rsquo; situation in
which a consecution really depends solely on the propositional
variables that occur therein. The significance of this clause is
indicated by the following general fact (see Shoesmith &amp; Smiley
1971): \(\langle\text{LM2}\rangle\) <em>A logic based on a
substitution-invariant <span class="sc">CR</span> is characterizable
by a single logical matrix iff it respects cancellation</em>. The
result extends to generalized consequence relations by considering a
symmetrical version of [Cancellation] and by adding of a further
condition concerning the &lsquo;stability&rsquo; of consequence
(Shoesmith &amp; Smiley 1978: ch. 15).</p>

<p>
Simple examples of logics that fail the cancellation condition are
provided by Haskell Curry&rsquo;s &lsquo;Logic of Classical
Refutability&rsquo; (1963: ch. 6), and Ingebrigt Johansson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Minimal Calculus&rsquo; (see Johansson 1937). Both logics
validate the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> consecution
\((\{p_1,\neg p_1\},\neg p_2)\) while not having \(\{p_1,\neg p_1\}\)
as a trivializing set of sentences nor having \(\neg p_2\) as a
theorem; this immediately implies that they fail [Cancellation]. In
agreement with the discussion started in
 <a href="#ExplAlgeStruSent">section 3.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#LogiMatrDesiBaseNotiEnta">section 3.2</a>
 (see also Marcos 2009), we may call such logics non-truth-functional,
since they admit no truth-tabular interpretation for the connectives.
Along these lines, one might use the cancellation condition to
characterize what a truth-functional logic is. It may be noted,
however, that the idea of a logic being truth-functional is sometimes
understood in a weaker sense, as pertaining only to the interpretation
of the connectives, without imposing a fixed set of designated values
(see Chemla &amp; &Eacute;gr&eacute; 2019, where <strong>KO</strong>,
and &lsquo;intersective mixed logics&rsquo; more generally&mdash;such
as ST and TS, see Chemla &amp; &Eacute;gr&eacute; 2019 and
below&mdash;are presented as admitting a truth-functional
semantics).</p>

<p>
It deserves mention that proofs of the general results on the semantic
characterization of substitution-invariant <span class="sc">GCR</span>s,
whether respecting cancellation or not, are
generally suboptimal with respect to the sets of truth values
involved: even taking classical logic as input, the logical matrices
exhibited by the proofs are infinite-valued. The general
characterization result \(\langle\text{LM1}\rangle\) is proved by
turning syntax into semantics, as often happens in completeness
proofs, fixing \(V=\textbf{Fm}\) and then considering the class of all
logical matrices having <em>theories</em> (sets of sentences closed
under consequence) as designated values (for a bilateral notion of
theory that is appropriate for the <span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
framework, check Blasio, Caleiro, &amp; Marcos 2021). For the second
characterization result, \(\langle\text{LM2}\rangle\), accommodating
truth-functional behavior forces one to take \(V=2^\textbf{Fm}\).
These are surely far too many values in case a logic actually happens
to be characterizable by a finite logical matrix. In the next section
we will discuss the proper scope of finite-valuedness.</p>

<h3 id="WhenLogiFiniValu">4.2 When is a logic finite-valued?</h3>

<p>
One may say that a truth-functional logic \(\L\) is <em>genuinely
\(\kappa\)-valued</em> whenever \(\kappa\) is the cardinality of the
smallest set of truth values over which \(\L\) can be given a
characterization in terms of a single logical matrix and the
designation-based notion of entailment. Classical logic, in this
sense, is genuinely two-valued, even though it might also be
circumstantially characterized by a non-truth-functional semantics or
by logical matrices with more than two truth values. A
<em>finite-valued</em> logic is a logic that is genuinely
\(\kappa\)-valued for some finite \(\kappa\). Abstract
characterizations (in the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework)
of logics characterizable by a single finite logical matrix and of
logics characterizable by finite collections of finite logical
matrices may be found in Caleiro, Marcelino, and Rivieccio (2018).</p>

<p>
A truth-functional logic may fail to be finite-valued. It is no
coincidence, indeed, that some well-known logics have been originally
proposed over infinite-valued logical matrices: this is the case, for
instance, of &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s \(\L_{\infty}\) (see Rose &amp;
Rosser 1958) and of other logics from the literature on fuzzy logics,
such as G&ouml;del-Dummett logic (see Dummett 1959). Other well-known
logics, such as intuitionistic logic, a number of the most common
normal modal logics and also various
 <a href="../logic-paraconsistent/">paraconsistent logics</a>,
 have been proved not to be characterizable by finite-valued
truth-tabular semantics (see G&ouml;del 1932; Dugundji 1940; Marcos
2008); however, given that they respect [Cancellation], we know that
each of these logics may be characterized by an infinite-valued
logical matrix. At any rate, whatever these characterizing logical
matrices turn out to be, we also know that they contain
\(\mathcal{M}_{\CL}\) as a submatrix. One may conclude, accordingly,
that intuitionistic implication is a generalization of classical
implication, and that modal boxes and diamonds are generalizations of
classical affirmation. So, deviant as they might seem to be, there is
a clear sense in which these logics may be seen as subclassical.</p>

<p>
A logic \(\L\) characterized by a truth-tabular semantics&mdash;to
wit, a logic based on a substitution-invariant consequence relation
\(\vdash\) that respects [Cancellation]&mdash;may perfectly well be
given a non-truth-functional semantic characterization, by way of
structures that are not alike customary logical matrices. Nonetheless,
from a conceptual viewpoint, in view of the above presented
consequence-theoretic characterization results, the temptation to call
such \(\L\) a &lsquo;non-truth-functional logic&rsquo; should be
resisted (see Marcos 2009).</p>

<h3 id="ManyValuLogiActuBiva">4.3 Are many-valued logics actually bivalent?</h3>

<p>
As previous sections have shown, a useful &lsquo;many-valued
trick&rsquo; for producing subclassical logics consists in building a
logical matrix in such a way as to ensure that it has the classical
two-valued matrix, \(\mathcal{M}_{\CL}\), as a submatrix; the presence
of additional truth values might actually help in getting rid of some
classically valid consecutions, in allowing for valuations that
capture subtle distinctions between &lsquo;different ways of being
true&rsquo; or between &lsquo;different ways of being false&rsquo;. In
all cases, however, logical matrices and the canonical semantics of
homomorphisms based on them are built over a partition of the set of
truth values into precisely two classes of values: the designated
ones, and the undesignated ones. This bipartition suggests that there
is a &lsquo;shadow of bivalence&rsquo; hanging over logical matrices.
In this section we will explain why and how this fact has been used to
argue that, in spite of the multitude of truth values allowed by
many-valuedness, &ldquo;there are but two logical values&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Many-valued logics are often presented as technical devices well
designed to defeat the so-called &lsquo;Principle of Bivalence&rsquo;,
according to which every sentence has exactly one truth value, either
true or false. The received view explained in
 <a href="#BivaQues">section 1</a>,
 according to which many-valuedness may be seen as an antidote to
bivalence, is actually quite contentious. Bearing witness to this,
there are a number of papers published by Roman Suszko in the 1970s in
which he accused &#321;ukasiewicz of, among other things, being
&ldquo;the chief perpetrator of a magnificent conceptual deceit
lasting out in mathematical logic to the present day&rdquo;, while
complaining that &ldquo;after 50 years we still face an illogical
paradise of many truths and falsehoods&rdquo; (see Suszko 1977).</p>

<p>
To help unravel the above issue, following Suszko we may distinguish
between the <em>algebraic valuations</em> that form the canonical
semantics associated to logical matrices, and <em>bivaluations</em>,
namely, \(\{F,T\}\)-valued assignments of values that might be
associated to the sentences induced by a given language. Given some
algebra of sentences, a <em>bivalent semantics</em> \(\mathbf{Sem}_2\)
is any collection of bivaluations over the universe of this algebra,
as long as it is closed for substitutions (recall
 <a href="#ManyValuRuleBaseAppr">section 3.4</a>).
 For convenience, we take henceforth bivaluations to be mappings on
\(\{F,T\}\); from these, the value \(T\) is taken to be
<em>designated</em> and the value \(F\) to be
<em>undesignated</em>.</p>

<p>
The following fact has been pointed out (see G. Malinowski 1993: ch.
10.1, and da Costa, B&eacute;ziau, &amp; Bueno 1996) as capturing the
essence of
 <a href="../truth-values/suszko-thesis.html">Suszko&rsquo;s Thesis</a>,
 concerning <span class="sc">GCR</span>s: <em>Every logic has a
bivalent semantics</em>. This claim has a straightforward proof (see
Caleiro et al. 2005): given the already mentioned exceedingly general
result concerning the characterizability of any <span class="sc">GCR</span>
\(\vdash\) by way of some collection of logical
matrices, one simply has to construct a bivalent semantics
\(\mathbf{Sem}_2\) by taking all algebraic valuations associated to
such logical matrices and converting them into bivaluations, mapping
designated values into \(T\) (representing &lsquo;The Truth&rsquo;)
and undesignated values into \(F\) (representing &lsquo;The
Falsity&rsquo;); clearly, \(\Pi\vdash\Sigma\) if and only if no
bivaluation in \(\mathbf{Sem}_2\) assigns \(T\) to all sentences in
\(\Pi\) and \(F\) to all sentences in \(\Sigma\).</p>

<p>
To be more specific about the effects of Suszko&rsquo;s <em>bivalent
reduction</em> of a logic, say that an arbitrary bivaluation
\(b\colon\mathbf{Fm}\to\{F,T\}\) is <em>consistent with</em> a
many-valued logic \(\langle \mathbf{Fm},\vdash\rangle\) if there is no
consecution \((\Pi,\Sigma)\) such that \(\Pi\vdash\Sigma\), while
\(b(\Pi)\subseteq\{T\}\) and \(b(\Sigma)\subseteq\{F\}\). From the
viewpoint of the symmetrical notion of consequence provided by <span class="sc">GCR</span>s,
the semantics \(\mathbf{Sem}_2\) produced by
the above reduction result contains all and only the bivaluations that
are consistent with the initially given logic. That is not the case,
however, if one turns to the asymmetrical notion of consequence given
by <span class="sc">CR</span>s. Indeed, given any collection
\(\mathbf{Biv}\) of bivaluations, consider the bivaluation
\(v_{\mathbf{Biv}}\) that maps a sentence \(\varphi\) into \(T\) if
and only if all valuations in \(\mathbf{Biv}\) map \(\varphi\) into
\(T\). It is easy to see that any such &lsquo;conjunctive
combination&rsquo; (following the terminology in Humberstone 2011) of
bivaluations is consistent with the logic induced by
\(\mathbf{Sem}_2\) in the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework,
but that is not the case, in general, in the <span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
framework. Indeed, the latter framework is
<em>categorical</em> in the sense that each logic is characterized by
a unique bivalent semantics (see Shoesmith &amp; Smiley 1978; Dunn
&amp; Hardegree 2001; Humberstone 2011). The failure of categoricity
within the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework had already been
recognized as early as in Carnap (1943), particularly in the case
where \(\mathbf{Biv}=\mathbf{Sem}_2\), and an entirely analogous
phenomenon has emerged more recently in the context of
&lsquo;supervaluationism&rsquo;, which we cover in
 <a href="#Supe">section 4.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Suszko drew inspiration from Frege&rsquo;s distinction between sense
and reference (see Suszko 1977) in saying that algebraic truth values
allowed logics to be seen as &lsquo;referentially many-valued&rsquo;,
while &ldquo;obviously any multiplication of logical values is a mad
idea&rdquo;, for the &lsquo;genuine definition&rsquo; of a logic by
way of &lsquo;logical valuations&rsquo; would show it to be
&lsquo;inferentially two-valued&rsquo; (see Suszko 1975). Clearly, no
genuinely \(\kappa\)-valued logic, for \(\kappa&gt;2\), can be
characterized by a bivalent semantics without loss of its
truth-functional behavior, and in that sense one might regard
many-valuedness as an algebraic technique that allows for
truth-functionality of a logic to be evinced, for the cases in which
it happens to serve a good practical purpose.</p>

<p>
Suszko&rsquo;s Thesis, in its turn, can also be given a practical
counterpart in terms of an actual reduction technique that allows for
finite-valued logics to be all presented in a uniform bivalent fashion
(see Caleiro &amp; Marcos 2012). An algorithmic procedure for
extracting a bivalent description for any such a logic is indeed
available, and it has been used, among other things, to help provide
uniform two-signed analytic tableau rules that adequately capture the
corresponding entailment relations (see Caleiro, Marcos, &amp; Volpe
2015). For an example of how a bivalent description of a three-valued
logic could look like, consider the case of &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s
\(\L_{3}\), analyzed in
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>
 and
 <a href="#ExprPoweManyValuLogi">section 3.3</a>.
 Let \(\mathbf{Biv}\) be the (non-truth-functional) collection of all
bivaluations \(b:\mathbf{Fm}_{\L_{3}}\to\{F,T\}\) constrained by the
following clauses:</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
  b(\varphi_1\to\varphi_2)=T   &amp;\quad \text{iff} &amp;&amp; b(\neg\varphi_1)=T \ \text{or} \\
  &amp; &amp; &amp; b(\varphi_2)=T \ \text{or} \\
  &amp;&amp; &amp; (b(\varphi_1)=F \ \text{and} \ b(\neg\varphi_2)=F) \\

  b(\neg(\varphi_1\to\varphi_2))=T
  &amp;\quad \text{iff} &amp;&amp;  b(\varphi_1)=T\ \text{and}\\  &amp; &amp; &amp; b(\neg\varphi_2)=T \\

  b(\neg\neg\varphi_1)=T
  &amp;\quad \text{iff} &amp;&amp;  b(\varphi_1)=T \\

  b(\neg\varphi_1)=T
  &amp;\quad \text{only if} &amp;&amp;  b(\varphi_1)=F
\end{align*}\]

<p>
The idea underlying the above illustrated characterization is to use
\(\neg\) as a way of &lsquo;separating&rsquo; between the two
undesignated values of \(\L_{3}\): while the truth value 0 of a
formula \(\varphi\) is captured by bivaluations that associate the
logical value \(T\) to \(\neg\varphi\), the truth value
\(\sfrac{1}{2}\) is captured by bivaluations that associate the
logical value \(F\) to both \(\varphi\) and \(\neg\varphi\). It is
easy to check that a consecution \((\Pi,\Sigma)\) is invalid according
to the three-valued logical matrix that determines \(\L_{3}\) if and
only if there is some \(b\in\mathbf{Biv}\) that is inconsistent with
\(\langle \mathbf{Fm}_{\L_{3}},\vdash_{\L_{3}}\rangle\).</p>

<h3 id="Supe">4.4 Supervaluations</h3>

<p>
The examination of bivaluations in the previous section also makes
relevant a discussion of supervaluations, which can be thought of as
trivaluations along similar lines. The term
&lsquo;supervaluation&rsquo; was originally introduced by Van Fraassen
(1966) in discussing the semantics of fictional terms and of future
contingents, but the idea originates in earlier work by Mehlberg
(1958) on the semantics of vague terms. Further seminal references
where supervaluations are deployed include Van Fraassen (1968) on
truth and presupposition, Thomason (1970) on temporal logics, Thomason
(1972) on sortal incorrectness, and Lewis (1970 [1972]); Fine (1975);
Kamp (1975) on vagueness. Moreover, &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s early
treatise (1913) handling probabilities as degrees of truth already
introduces a similar idea in relation to the treatment of what
&#321;ukasiewicz calls &lsquo;indefinite propositions&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
As its name indicates, the idea of supervaluations is to assign
sentences of a given language a semantic value <em>over and above</em>
the value originally assigned by them in terms of ordinary valuations.
For simplicity, we will restrict our presentation here to the case of
a propositional language (with negation, conjunction and disjunction),
bearing in mind that the main applications are usually presented in
quantificational logics (where valuations become models). Relative to
a set \(\mathcal{V}\) of valuations for a propositional language
\(\mathcal{L}\), a sentence \(\varphi\) is said to be:</p>

\[\begin{cases}
\text{super-true} &amp; \text{if every } v \in \mathcal{V} \text{ is
such that } v(\varphi) = 1, \\
\text{super-false} &amp; \text{if every } v \in \mathcal{V}  \text{ is
such that } v(\varphi) = 0, \\
\text{neither} &amp; \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\]

<p>
In the literature, \(\mathcal{V}\) is typically assumed to be a set of
classical two-valued valuations, although the idea is in principle
applicable to other types of valuations. The main motivation, in the
case of vagueness for example, is that a vague term like
&ldquo;rich&rdquo; is one that admits multiple precise
interpretations. A sentence involving a vague term will be called
super-true exactly when it is true on all of its precise
interpretations. In this way, super-truth is meant to capture a notion
of determinate truth. Furthermore, a complex sentence can be
super-true even when its component parts are not: &ldquo;Saya is rich
or Saya is not rich&rdquo; is supposed to be true however one
interprets &ldquo;rich&rdquo;, unlike &ldquo;Saya is rich&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Saya is not rich&rdquo; (see Fine 1975). Likewise, using this
framework &ldquo;there will be a sea battle tomorrow or there
won&rsquo;t be a sea battle tomorrow&rdquo; is predicted to be
super-true, even when neither disjunct is (see Van Fraassen 1966).</p>

<p>
Supervaluationist validity can be defined based on the preservation of
super-truth. In the <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> framework, and
assuming a standard propositional language, set:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \models_{\text{SV}} \varphi\) iff, for every set \(\mathcal{V}\)
of classical valuations for the language, when all sentences in
\(\Pi\) are super-true (relative to \(\mathcal{V}\)), \(\varphi\) is
super-true (relative to \(\mathcal{V}\)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A central motivation for the use of supervaluations has been to
preserve classical consequence, and indeed, it is easy to prove
that:</p> 
\[\Pi \models_{\text{SV}} \varphi
\ifft \Pi \models_{\CL} \varphi\]

<p>
When the above definition is extended to the <span class="sc">Set-Set</span>
framework, however, this coincidence breaks
down. Set:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \models_{\text{SV}} \Sigma\) iff, for every set \(\mathcal{V}\)
of classical valuations for the language, when all sentences in
\(\Pi\) are super-true (relative to \(\mathcal{V}\)), some sentence in
\(\Sigma\) is super-true (relative to \(\mathcal{V}\)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this case, we only have that:</p> 
\[\Pi \models_{\text{SV}} \Sigma\quad
\text{implies}\quad \Pi \models_{\CL} \Sigma\]

<p>
Thus, supervaluationist consequence fails the rule of
<em>abjunction</em>, whereby \(\varphi\vee \psi \models_{\CL} \varphi,
\psi\), in particular: \(p\vee \neg p \not\models_{\text{SV}} p, \neg
p\). This makes the supervaluationist logic SV distinct not just from
classical logic, but also from the strong Kleene logic \(\K_{3}\).
However, \(\models_{\text{SV}} \varphi \vee \neg \varphi\), that is
the Law of Excluded Middle remains valid, and so do all other
classical sentential laws.</p>

<p>
Because of the trivalent status sentences receive with
supervaluations, the supervaluationist logic SV is often viewed as a
kind of many-valued logic that is not based on a truth-functional
notion of semantic interpretation. The argument against
truth-functionality is that a disjunction can be super-true without
either of its disjuncts being super-true. Strictly speaking, however,
the supervaluationist logic SV is better conceived as a logic based on
a value-functional semantics that is Boolean-valued (see Field 2008:
166 and Cobreros &amp; Tranchini 2014). Given a set \(\mathcal{V}\) of
valuations, set:</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
\llbracket p\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} &amp; := \{v \in \mathcal{V} \mid v(p) = 1\} \\
\llbracket \neg \varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} &amp; := \mathcal{V} \setminus
\llbracket \varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} \\
\llbracket  \varphi \wedge \psi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} &amp; :=
\llbracket \varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} \cap \llbracket \psi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}}\\
\llbracket  \varphi \vee \psi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} &amp; :=
\llbracket \varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}} \cup \llbracket \psi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}}
\end{align*}\]

<p>
A sentence \(\varphi\) is super-true, therefore, when \(\llbracket
\varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}}=\mathcal{V}\), super-false when
\(\llbracket \varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}}=\emptyset\), and neither
super-true nor super-false otherwise. Using this definition, it is
immediate that the semantic value of a sentence is value-functional.
Besides, we can define supervaluationist validity equivalently as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Pi \models_{\text{SV}} \Sigma\) iff, for every set \(\mathcal{V}\)
of classical valuations for the language, whenever \(\llbracket
\varphi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}}=\mathcal{V}\) for every \(\varphi\in
\Pi\), then \(\llbracket \psi\rrbracket_{\mathcal{V}}=\mathcal{V}\)
for some \(\psi\in \Sigma\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, every power set algebra is a Boolean algebra, and conversely, by
Stone&rsquo;s representation theorem, every Boolean algebra can be
represented by a power set algebra. Hence, the supervaluationist value
of a sentence can be represented by an element in some Boolean algebra
(see Akiba 2017), and just as for classical logic, this need not be a
two-element Boolean algebra, but, in the finite case, it will be a
\(2^n\)-element algebra, and will fail to be linearly ordered as soon
as \(n&gt;1\).</p>

<p>
In the literature, and particularly in relation to applications to
vagueness, supervaluationism has often been opposed to fuzzy logic and
to truth-functional many-valued semantics. Thus, as Field (2008: 169)
points out, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s common to distinguish supervaluational
approaches to vagueness from degree-theoretic approaches&rdquo;. But
as Field aptly continues: &ldquo;this is misleading: supervaluational
approaches are in effect degree-theoretic, they use Boolean
degrees&rdquo;. Generally speaking, the supervaluationist logic SV and
classical logic can therefore both be seen as Boolean many-valued
logics, namely as systems in which sentences are interpreted by
elements of a Boolean algebra with possibly more than two elements.
But the main difference between them concerns the definition of
validity.</p>

<p>
Supervaluations are one way of producing a trivalent logic, but this
is not the only way. In the same manner in which the definition of
validity can be dualized in the case of \(\K_{3}\) to yield LP, the
dualization of supervaluationism corresponds to
<em>subvaluationism</em>, an approach originating in the work of
Ja&#347;kowski (1948), and explored by Varzi (1994), and Hyde (1997).
A sentence is <em>sub-true</em>, relative to a set \(\mathcal{V}\) of
valuations, when it is true in some element \(v\) of \(\mathcal{V}\),
and subvaluationist validity can be defined as the preservation of
sub-truth. And as supervaluationist validity fails abjunction,
subvaluationism fails <em>adjunction</em> (i.e., \(\varphi, \psi\)
need not entail \(\varphi\wedge \psi\)). The supervaluationist logic
SV has been described by Hyde (2008) as <em>weakly paracomplete</em>
(while it fails to validate \(\psi \models \varphi, \neg \varphi\), it
validates \(\psi \models\varphi\vee \neg \varphi\)), and the
corresponding subvaluationist logic sV as <em>weakly
paraconsistent</em> (while it fails to validate \(\varphi, \neg
\varphi \models \psi\), it validates \(\varphi \wedge \neg
\varphi\models \psi\)). Just as SV differs from both CL and
\(\K_{3}\), sV differs from both CL and LP (see Ripley 2013 and
Cobreros et al. 2012a for detailed comparisons), and moreover SV and
sV are dual logics, in the same sense in which \(\K_{3}\) and LP are
dual.</p>

<p>
For further work regarding supervaluationism and its departures from
classical logic, in particular in the first-order case, we refer to
Kremer and Kremer (2003); Varzi (2007); and Ripley (2013). For more
information on the algebra of supervaluationism, see Herzberger (1980,
1982). Finally, in analogy with the way in which mixed notions of
validity are defined for matrix-based many-valued logics (see
 <a href="#InfeManyValu">section 5.2</a>),
 mixed notions of validity involving both super- and sub-valuationist
truth have also been explored (see Bennett 1998; Cobreros et al.
2012a; Porter 2022).</p>

<h2 id="GeneLogiMatr">5. Generalizing logical matrices</h2>

<p>
While many-valuedness has provided a practical illustration of how
truth-functionality can be harnessed from a logical viewpoint, in the
literature the latter notion has actually been relaxed in a number of
useful ways, through generalizations of the concept of logical
matrices. One of these ways (see
 <a href="#NonDeteSema">section 5.1</a>),
 giving origin to the concept of &lsquo;non-deterministic
semantics&rsquo; (see Avron &amp; Lev 2005), is based on the idea that
the truth values of complex sentences are constrained, but not
necessarily uniquely determined, by the truth values of their parts.
Another way (see
 <a href="#InfeManyValu">section 5.2</a>),
 giving rise to the concept of &lsquo;inferential
many-valuedness&rsquo; (see G. Malinowski 1994), is based on
considering logical matrices equipped with at least one additional set
of designated values and alternative notions of entailment that are
defined so as to take into account such added structure, using
<em>two-dimensional matrices</em>, or equivalently, so-called
<em>mixed consequence relations</em>. We briefly explain both
generalizations in what follows, pointing out to some of the main
related results and applications of philosophical interest.</p>

<h3 id="NonDeteSema">5.1 Non-deterministic semantics</h3>

<p>
One strategy for relaxing the notion of truth-functionality goes like
this. Recall that a language \(L\) given by a collection of
connectives \(\Sigma\) (a propositional signature) and a non-empty
collection \(At\) of atomic sentences induces a set \(Fm\) of
sentences (namely, the universe of the algebra
\(\mathbf{Fm}^\Sigma(At)\) freely generated by \(At\) over
\(\Sigma\)). Remember also that a logical matrix
\(\langle\mathbf{M},D\rangle\) for \(L\) provides a domain \(V\) of
truth values over which each \(m\)-ary connective \(\copyright\) is
interpreted by an \(m\)-ary operation \(\copyright^\mathbf{M}\) on
\(V\), that is, \(\copyright^\mathbf{M}\) deterministically picks for
each \(m\)-tuple \(x_1,\ldots,x_m\) of elements of \(V\) a unique
\(x\in V\) as a value. Consider now a non-empty \(S\subseteq \Fm\) and
collect in \(At_S\) all atomic sentences that occur in the sentences
of \(S\) (so, \(At_S\) is a subset of the universe \(Fm[S]\) of
\(\mathbf{Fm}^\Sigma(At_S)\)). In this case, in view of
substitution-invariance
 (<a href="#ManyValuRuleBaseAppr">section 3.4</a>)
 and the cancellation condition
 (<a href="#WhicLogiAdmiTrutFuncChar">section 4.1</a>),
 &lsquo;compositionality of meaning&rsquo; implies that:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>Once one knows the values assigned by a (partial) valuation \(v\)
over \(S\), one may always extend such \(v\) so as to cover all the
sentences in \(Fm[S]\); this can be done by recovering the atomic
truth assignment on \(At_S\) that induces \(v\) and then (uniquely)
extending it into a full homomorphism, respecting the (deterministic)
operations that interpret the connectives.</li>

<li>Given that values assigned to atomic sentences that do not occur
in \(S\) do not interfere with the values assigned to sentences in
\(At_S\), a valuation over \(Fm[S]\) may be extended into a valuation
over all sentences in \(Fm\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
For instance, by knowing that \(w(p_0\to p_1)=0\) and \(w(p_0\to \neg
p_2)=0\), for a certain classical valuation \(w\), one may conclude
that this valuation extends an atomic truth assignment \(\mathsf{a}\)
such that \(\mathsf{a}(p_0)=1=\mathsf{a}(p_2)\) and
\(\mathsf{a}(p_1)=0\); in its turn, this assignment is extendable into
a full classical valuation \(v_\mathsf{a}\) on \(Fm\) that agrees with
\(w\) on the values assigned to the sentences \(p_0\to p_1\) and
\(p_0\to \neg p_2\), determining thus the value of a sentence such as
\(\neg p_1\to p_2\), and also allowing for a value to be assigned to a
sentence such as \(p_3\to p_0\) as soon as a value to be assigned by
\(\mathsf{a}\) to \(p_3\) is chosen.</p>

<p>
An intuitive way of generalizing the compositional behavior
illustrated just above is obtained by organizing the truth values into
multialgebras, rather than algebras. This means that the \(m\)-ary
interpretation of \(\copyright\), according to the multialgebra
\(\mathbf{N}\) is allowed to non-deterministically choose, for each
given input, among a certain collection of possible outputs in its
universe \(V\). So, rather than taking for
\(\copyright^\mathbf{N}(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\) a fixed value in \(V\) and
setting
\(v(\copyright(\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_k))=\copyright^\mathbf{N}(v(\varphi_1),\ldots,v(\varphi_k))\),
one allows, instead, \(\copyright^\mathbf{N}(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\) to pick
a non-empty subset of \(V\) and sets the constraint according to which
\(v(\copyright(\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_k))\in\copyright^\mathbf{N}(v(\varphi_1),\ldots,v(\varphi_k))\).
This time, in order to guarantee that each partial valuation on a set
of sentences \(S\subseteq \Fm\) is extendable into a full homomorphism
on \(Fm[S]\) one must in general make sure that \(S\) is closed under
subsentences. For an example, consider the following
&lsquo;non-deterministic truth tables&rsquo;, which induce the logic
called K/2 in B&eacute;ziau (1999), as well as a fragment of the logic
called CLaN in Batens, De Clercq, and Kurtonina (1999):</p>

<p>
Note that there is here a single point of divergence from the
deterministic truth tables for classical logic, namely, while
\(\neg^{\mathbf{B}_{\CL}}0=1\), here we have
\(\neg^{\mathbf{N}}0\in\{0,1\}\). Going back to the previous example,
by knowing that \(w(p_0\to p_1)=0\) and \(w(p_0\to \neg p_2)=0\), for
a certain valuation \(w\) respecting the conditions encoded in the
above truth tables, one may conclude that \(w(p_0)=1\), \(w(p_1)=0\),
\(w(\neg p_0)=0\) and \(w(\neg p_2)=0\), but nothing is known, in
principle, about \(w(p_2)\), or about \(w(\neg p_1)\). However, once
values for \(w(p_2)\) and \(w(\neg p_1)\) are agreed upon, according
to the constraints set by \(\neg^\mathbf{N}\), a value for a sentence
such as \(\neg p_1\to p_2\) happens to be (in this specific case,
uniquely) determined by \(\to^\mathbf{N}\), and something analogous
occurs to the sentence \(p_3\to p_2\) after the value of \(w(p_3)\) is
also agreed upon. For an example that stresses how valuations are
treated under non-deterministic choices, consider the sentence \(\neg
p_4\to(\neg p_4\to\neg p_5)\). Notice that a partial valuation that
assigns the value 0 to both \(p_4\) and \(p_5\) must of course assign
the same value to both occurrences of \(\neg p_4\) in the above
compound sentence, yet it does not need to assign the same value to
\(\neg p_4\) and to \(\neg p_5\); in this particular case it follows
that the value that will be assigned to \(\neg p_4\to(\neg p_4\to\neg
p_5)\) simply cannot be ascertained under certain atomic truth
assignments. In any case, it should be clear that while the truth
value assigned to a compound sentence \(\varphi\) still depends on the
values assigned to the atomic sentences that occur in \(\varphi\),
according to the structure of \(\varphi\), the truth value of
\(\varphi\) is no longer (functionally) determined by such atomic
truth assignments.</p>

<p>
Foreshadowed by F&eacute;vrier (1937) and fleshed out by Rescher
(1962); Kearns (1981); Ivlev (1988); Crawford and Etherington (1998),
the structural change on logical matrices explained above, known as
<em>non-deterministic semantics</em> (see Avron &amp; Zamansky 2011),
replaces the algebras of truth values by a generalization thereof, but
does not touch the set of designated values, which may be used to
define entailment exactly as before. Note that many logics that fail
to be characterizable by a finite-valued deterministic semantics
(recall
 <a href="#WhenLogiFiniValu">section 4.2</a>)
 are, nonetheless, characterizable by finite-valued non-deterministic
semantics (see, for instance, Avron 2009 and Verd&eacute;e 2021).</p>

<p>
A further natural generalization, known as <em>partial
non-deterministic semantics</em> (see Baaz, Lahav, &amp; Zamansky
2013), lifts the constraint according to which the subset of \(V\)
picked by \(\copyright^\mathbf{N}(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\) must be non-empty.
In this case, to guarantee extensibility of a given partial valuation,
that is, to confirm that the extended valuation respects the
non-deterministic truth tables, besides the already mentioned
requirement that the set on which the initial valuation is defined
must be closed under subsentences, it is necessary to also require the
image of the extended valuation to be contained in a &lsquo;total
component&rsquo; of the partial non-deterministic logical matrix, that
is, the said valuation should belong to a (non-partial)
non-deterministic submatrix of the given matrix. Kleene&rsquo;s logic
of order provides a natural example of a logic that has a
straightforward four-valued partial non-deterministic characterization
(see Caleiro &amp; Marcelino 2019), given by
\(\mathcal{M}_{KO}=\langle\mathbf{KO},\{b,1\}\rangle\), where the
universe of <strong>KO</strong> is the set \(\{0,a,b,1\}\) and the
connectives \(\land\), \(\lor\) and \(\neg\) are interpreted as
follows:</p>

<p>
Note that if \(p_1\) is assigned the value \(a\) and \(p_2\) is
assigned the value \(b\) then there is simply no valuation that gives
a value to \(p_1\land p_2\), for such an assignment does not belong to
any total component of \(\mathcal{M}_{KO}\). Indeed, the total
components of the above matrices are precisely those that are based on
the sets that do not contain, at once, both the values \(a\) and
\(b\). The designation-based entailment relation induced by
\(\mathcal{M}_{KO}\) characterizes the logic corresponding to the
intersection of two logics with three-valued deterministic semantics,
namely \(\K_{3}\) and LP. The two latter logics may actually be
recovered, in fact, as the submatrices that take as truth values,
respectively, the sets \(\{0,a,1\}\) and \(\{0,b,1\}\). Clearly,
Kleene&rsquo;s Logic of Order fails the cancellation property.</p>

<p>
Finally, it is also worth noting that partial non-deterministic
semantics may be elegantly employed to provide a many-valued semantics
to the
 <a href="../logic-combining/">combination</a>
 (via fibring) of any two logics (see Caleiro &amp; Marcelino
2024).</p>

<h3 id="InfeManyValu">5.2 Inferential many-valuedness</h3>

<p>
A second strategy for generalizing logical matrices leaves the
algebras of truth values untouched, but considers multiple sets of
designated values and defines entailment in a way that potentially
takes all such sets simultaneously into account. In the simplest
instance, this ends up giving rise, as we shall see, to
&lsquo;logically three-valued&rsquo; and &lsquo;logically
four-valued&rsquo; logics.</p>

<p>
For an illustration of how this goes, fix a language \(L\) and an
algebra of truth values \(\mathbf{A}\) in the same signature as the
algebra \(\mathbf{Fm}_L\) of sentences induced by \(L\). Let \(V\) be
the universe of \(\mathbf{A}\). By selecting an arbitrary subset \(D\)
of \(V\) one defines a (one-dimensional) logical matrix
\(\mathcal{M}^1=\langle\mathbf{A},D\rangle\), to which a
Tarskian-inspired natural notion of entailment
 (<a href="#LogiMatrDesiBaseNotiEnta">section 3.2</a>)
 is associated setting \(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^1}\Sigma\) if there is
no \(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\) for which \(v[\Pi]\subseteq D\) and
\(v[\Sigma]\subseteq U\). In this case one may identify the judgment
of &lsquo;assertion&rsquo; as characteristic of the set \(D\) and
identify the judgment of &lsquo;denial&rsquo; as characteristic of the
set \(U=V\setminus D\), giving origin to Suszko&rsquo;s reduction of
the original &lsquo;algebraic values&rsquo; into two &lsquo;logical
values&rsquo; that represent such judgments. Now, let a
<em>two-dimensional logical matrix</em>
\(\mathcal{M}^2=\langle\mathbf{A},D_\mathsf{Y},D_\mathsf{N}\rangle\)
for the language \(L\) have both \(D_\mathsf{Y}\) and \(D_\mathsf{N}\)
independently selected as designated subsets of \(V\). One may
associate \(D_\mathsf{Y}\) with the cognitive attitude of
&lsquo;acceptance&rsquo;, and one may associate \(D_\mathsf{N}\) with
the cognitive attitude of &lsquo;rejection&rsquo;. Within such a
picture, it makes sense, in general, to consider for their own
interest the &lsquo;non-accepted&rsquo; values
\(\overline{D_\mathsf{Y}}=V\setminus D_\mathsf{Y}\) and the
&lsquo;non-rejected&rsquo; values \(\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}=V\setminus
D_\mathsf{N}\). Several different natural &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; accounts
of validity may then be associated to \(\mathcal{M}^2\), according to
which attitude one chooses as being relevant in evaluating the premise
set, and which attitude one chooses as being relevant in evaluating
the conclusion set. Some entailment patterns that may arise from such
choices are:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>

<p>
\(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gt}\Sigma\) if there is no
\(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\) for which \(v[\Pi]\subseteq
D_\mathsf{Y}\) and \(v[\Sigma]\subseteq \overline{D_\mathsf{Y}}\)
<br />
(&lsquo;accepting all sentences in \(\Pi\) implies accepting some
sentence in \(\Sigma\)&rsquo;)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gf}\Sigma\) if there is no
\(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\) for which \(v[\Pi]\subseteq
\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}\) and \(v[\Sigma]\subseteq D_\mathsf{N}\)
<br />
(&lsquo;non-rejecting all sentences in \(\Pi\) implies non-rejecting
some sentence in \(\Sigma\)&rsquo;)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gq}\Sigma\) if there is no
\(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\) for which \(v[\Pi]\subseteq
\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}\) and \(v[\Sigma]\subseteq
\overline{D_\mathsf{Y}}\)
<br />
(&lsquo;non-rejecting all sentences in \(\Pi\) implies accepting some
sentence in \(\Sigma\)&rsquo;)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\Pi\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gp}\Sigma\) if there is no
\(\mathbf{A}\)-valuation \(v\) for which \(v[\Pi]\subseteq
D_\mathsf{Y}\) and \(v[\Sigma]\subseteq D_\mathsf{N}\)
<br />
(&lsquo;accepting all sentences in \(\Pi\) implies non-rejecting some
sentence in \(\Sigma\)&rsquo;)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Note, on the one hand, that choices (a) and (b) reduce, respectively,
to the natural entailment relations associated to the one-dimensional
logical matrices
\(\mathcal{M}^1_\mathsf{Y}=\langle\mathbf{A},D_\mathsf{Y}\rangle\) and
\(\mathcal{M}^1_\mathsf{N}=\langle\mathbf{A},\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}\rangle\).
On the other hand, whenever the pair of sets \(D_\mathsf{Y}\) and
\(D_\mathsf{N}\) does not constitute a partition of the universe of
truth values \(V\), choices (c) and (d) provide accounts of validity
that, as we shall point out, go beyond generalized consequence
relations.</p>

<p>
An upgraded version of Suszko&rsquo;s Thesis
 (<a href="#ManyValuLogiActuBiva">section 4.3</a>)
 may then be entertained, according to which one would say that a
sentence \(\varphi\) is assigned, by a valuation \(v\):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>

<p>
the logical value \(\mathsf{t}\) if it is both accepted and
non-rejected (i.e., \(v(\varphi)\in
D_\mathsf{Y}\cap\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}\))</p></li>

<li>

<p>
the logical value \(\mathsf{b}\) if it is both accepted and rejected
(i.e., \(v(\varphi)\in D_\mathsf{Y}\cap D_\mathsf{N}\))</p></li>

<li>

<p>
the logical value \(\mathsf{n}\) if it is neither accepted nor
rejected (i.e., \(v(\varphi)\in
\overline{D_\mathsf{Y}}\cap\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}\))</p></li>

<li>

<p>
the logical value \(\mathsf{f}\) if it is both rejected and
non-accepted (i.e., \(v(\varphi)\in \overline{D_\mathsf{Y}}\cap
D_\mathsf{N}\))</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Observe that each one of these new <em>logical values</em> corresponds
to a combination of cognitive attitudes, rather than to a single
designated set of truth values from \(\mathcal{M}^2\), for the
attitudes live at the edges, rather than at the nodes, of the
well-known lattice \(\mathbf{4}\)
 (<a href="#TrueFalsNeitBoth">section 2.3</a>):</p>
 
<div class="figure">
<img style="width:8em" src="figure4.svg" alt="four nodes enclosed in circles arranged in a square: f, b, t, and n. f and b are connected by a line labeled N. b and t by a line labeled Y. t and n by a line labeled N. n and f by a line labeled Y." />
</div>

<p>
On what concerns the Tarskian conditions on consequence
 (<a href="#LogiMatrDesiBaseNotiEnta">section 3.2</a>),
 it is worth noticing that: in case (ii) where sentences are allowed
to take the logical value \(\mathsf{b}\) (because \(D_\mathsf{Y}\cap
D_\mathsf{N}\neq\emptyset\)), the overlap condition [R], in the
definition of generalized consequence, fails; in case (iii) where
sentences are allowed to take the logical value \(\mathsf{n}\)
(because
\(\overline{D_\mathsf{Y}}\cap\overline{D_\mathsf{N}}\neq\emptyset\))
the cut condition [T], in the definition of generalized consequence,
fails. In the general case, as condition [M] is the only one that is
guaranteed to hold for the above introduced &lsquo;mixed&rsquo;
designation-based notion of entailment, what we have is that logics
induced by two-dimensional logical matrices correspond precisely to
&lsquo;purely monotonic&rsquo; binary relations on sets of sentences.
In contrast to Suszko&rsquo;s bivalent reduction of logics respecting
conditions [R], [M] and [T], in
 <a href="#ManyValuLogiActuBiva">section 4.3</a>,
 here we witness a tetravalent reduction of the notion of consequence
associated to the present richer semantical framework. For different
presentations and perspectives on these tetravalent reductions, see
Humberstone (1988); J. Malinowski (2004); Blasio, Marcos, and Wansing
(2017); French and Ripley (2019); Chemla and &Eacute;gr&eacute;
(2019).</p>

<p>
Logically three-valued logics have been the object of intense study in
recent years, with the help of two-dimensional logical matrices based
on three-element algebras. For the sake of concreteness, fix
\(V=\{0,\sfrac{1}{2},1\}\) as the universe of the latter algebras. In
such context, two particular definitional schemas have received more
attention, namely:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li id="schema1">

<p>
the \(\vdash^\mathsf{gq}\) entailment pattern, choosing
\(D_\mathsf{Y}=\{\sfrac{1}{2},1\}\) and
\(D_\mathsf{N}=\{0,\sfrac{1}{2}\}\) as designated sets</p></li>

<li id="schema2">

<p>
the \(\vdash^\mathsf{gp}\) entailment pattern, choosing
\(D_\mathsf{Y}=\{1\}\) and \(D_\mathsf{N}=\{0\}\) as designated
sets</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
 <a href="#schema1">Schema 1</a>
 was explicitly proposed by G. Malinowski (1990) to illustrate a way
of resisting Suszko&rsquo;s bivalent reduction, and
 <a href="#schema1">schema 2</a>
 was proposed by Frankowski (2004) to show how schema 1 could be
dualized; both schemas were originally proposed in terms of
consequence operators and <span class="sc">Set-Fmla</span> consequence
relations.</p>

<p>
If ones identifies the set \(\{\sfrac{1}{2},1\}\) with &lsquo;being
tolerantly true&rsquo; and identifies the set \(\{1\}\) with
&lsquo;being strictly true&rsquo;, one may say that:
 <a href="#schema1">schema 1</a>
 amounts to saying that if all sentences in the premise set are
tolerantly true, then at least one sentence in the conclusion set is
strictly true;
 <a href="#schema1">schema 2</a>
 amounts to saying that if all sentences in the premise set are
strictly true, then at least one sentence in the conclusion set is
tolerantly true (see Cobreros et al. 2012b; Zardini 2008).
Accordingly, in the <span class="sc">Set-Set</span> framework, schema
1 is also known as <i>ts</i>-consequence, and schema 2 as
<i>st</i>-consequence. By working on logical matrices based on the
algebra \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\)
 (<a href="#TwoThreTrutValuGapsGlut">section 2.2</a>),
 <i>ts</i>-consequence and <i>st</i>-consequence have been used to
define, respectively, particular three-valued logics known as TS and
ST (see Cobreros et al. 2012b, 2015; Barrio, Rosenblatt, &amp; Tajer
2015). Both logics bear some systematic relations to the logics LP and
\(\K_{3}\), also based on \(\mathbf{\KA_3}\), but with important
conceptual differences concerning inferential many-valuedness. These
logics, moreover, combine paraconsistent and paracomplete features.
ST, for example, validates Explosion like \(\K_{3}\), but when
augmented with a transparent truth-predicate, validates the Liar and
its negation like LP (see Ripley 2012; Cobreros et al. 2013). The
exploration of such &lsquo;mixed consequence&rsquo; logics is an
active domain of research (see Wintein 2016; Chemla,
&Eacute;gr&eacute;, &amp; Spector 2017; Chemla &amp;
&Eacute;gr&eacute; 2021; Fitting 2021; Da R&eacute; et al. 2024;
Pailos 2024; Paoli &amp; P&#345;enosil 2024), with also detailed
explorations of higher-order entailment relations (the so-called
meta-inferences, for which check Dicher &amp; Paoli 2019; Barrio,
Pailos, &amp; Szmuc 2020; Cobreros et al. 2020).</p>

<p>
Finally, a two-dimensional consequence-theoretic framework for dealing
with entailment relations induced by the two-dimensional logical
matrix \(\mathcal{M}^2\) involves, first of all, changing the shape of
consecutions into \((2\times 2)\)-place expressions, and dividing both
the premise set and the conclusion set in two parts so as to fill this
new pattern (see Bochman 1998; Blasio et al. 2017). Next, one may
define:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\( \begin{array}{c|c} \Phi_{11} &amp; \Phi_{12}\\\hline \Phi_{21}
&amp;\Phi_{22}\\ \end{array} \) is \(\mathcal{M}^2\)-valid iff</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

<li>it is not the case that

<li>all sentences in \(\Phi_{11}\) are non-rejected,</li>

<li>all sentences in \(\Phi_{21}\) are accepted,</li>

<li>all sentences in \(\Phi_{12}\) are non-accepted, and</li>

<li>all sentences in \(\Phi_{22}\) are rejected.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
It is clear, then, that the entailment patterns
\(\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gt}\) and
\(\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gf}\) live at the diagonals, while
\(\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gq}\) lives in the upper part and
\(\vdash_{\mathcal{M}^2}^\mathsf{gp}\) lives in the lower part of the
above two-dimensional consecution. In such a <span class="sc">Set</span>\(^2\)-<span class="sc">Set</span>\(^2\)
framework, for instance, it is possible to see that in a logic such as
TS, commonly referred to as &lsquo;non-reflexive&rsquo;, actually
respects several forms of reflexivity, such as
\(\squarear{}{\varphi}{\varphi}{}\),
\(\squarear{\varphi}{}{}{\varphi}\), and
\(\squarear{\varphi}{\varphi}{}{}\), while really only failing the
following form of reflexivity: \(\squarear{}{}{\varphi}{\varphi}.\)
Such two-dimensional notion of entailment may also be used to show
that an analogous phenomenon happens with the
&lsquo;non-transitive&rsquo; logic ST.</p>

<h2 id="ManyValuFirsOrdeModaLogi">6. Many-valued first-order and modal logics</h2>

<p>
This entry has focused exclusively on propositional many-valued logics
thus far. This is because the main points of difference between
classical logic and many-valued logics arise already at the
propositional level, and disregarding complications related to
 <a href="../quantification/">quantification</a>
 brings these differences into sharper focus. In addition, while the
study of many-valued propositional logics has reached a mature stage,
with a stable and systematic theory that uniformly applies to many
families of logics, at the first-order level there is less consensus
as to what the right approach is and the existing approaches to
first-order many-valued logics are more piecemeal. Nonetheless, an
extensive body of research on the topic has accumulated over the last
half a century. The motivation behind going first-order is clear: even
if many-valued propositional logics overcome some of the limitations
of classical logic, a propositional language is insufficiently
expressive for many purposes, given that the bulk of mathematical,
empirical, and philosophical reasoning takes place at the first-order
(or even higher-order) level.</p>

<p>
Using again classical first-order logic as a point of reference
 (<a href="#CaseClasFirsOrdeLogi">section 6.1</a>),
 we introduce the lattice-based semantics of Mostowski
 (<a href="#ManyValuFirsOrdeLogi">section 6.2</a>)
 and the more general semantics of distribution quantifiers
 (<a href="#LogiDistQuan">section 6.3</a>).
 The section concludes with a discussion of many-valued modal logic
 (<a href="#ManyValuModaLogi">section 6.4</a>),
 which can be thought of as occupying an intermediate level between
propositional and first-order logic.</p>

<h3 id="CaseClasFirsOrdeLogi">6.1 The case of classical first-order logic</h3>

<p>
As in the case of propositional logics, it will be convenient to use
the syntax and semantics of
 <a href="../logic-classical/">classical first-order logic</a>
 (without equality) as our point of departure. A <em>first-order
signature</em> consists of a set of <em>relation symbols</em> and a
set of <em>function symbols</em>, each with a given (non-negative
integer) arity. Nullary function symbols are more commonly called
<em>constant symbols</em>. For example, the signature may contain one
binary relation symbol \(\lt\), one binary function symbol \(+\), and
one constant symbol 0. In the following definitions, we assume that we
have fixed a first-order signature, as well as an infinite set \(Var\)
of <em>variables</em>. One may more explicitly call these
<em>individual variables</em>, to contrast them with the
<em>propositional variables</em> encountered in the previous
sections.</p>

<p>
The syntax of classical first-order logic consists of two tiers: terms
and formulas. The set \(Tm\) of <em>terms</em> is the smallest set
which contains all variables and is closed under the application of
function symbols (in particular, it contains all constant symbols). An
<em>atomic formula</em> has the form \(R(t_1, \dots, t_n)\), where
\(R\) is a relation symbol of arity \(n\) and \(t_1, \dots,t_n\) are
terms. The set \(Fm\) of all <em>formulas</em> of classical
first-order logic is then the smallest set which contains all atomic
formulas and is closed under the propositional connectives of
classical logic (for the sake of concreteness: the binary connectives
\(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\rightarrow\), the unary connective \(\neg\),
and the truth constants \(\top\) and \(\bot\)), and is closed under
quantifiers: if \(\varphi\) is a formula and \(x\) is a variable, then
\(\forall x \, \varphi\) and \(\exists x\, \varphi\) are formulas.</p>

<p>
Now for the semantics of classical first-order logic. A
<em>first-order structure</em> \(\mathfrak{M}\) consists of a
non-empty set \(\textrm{M}\), called the <em>domain</em> of
\(\mathfrak{M}\), an \(n\)-ary relation \(R^{\mathfrak{M}}\subseteq
\textrm{M}^{n}\) for each relation symbol \(R\) of arity \(n\), and an
\(n\)-ary function \(f^{\mathfrak{M}}\colon\textrm{M}^{n} \to
\textrm{M}\) for each function symbol \(f\) of arity \(n\). For
example, the set of rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) together with the
standard strict order \(\lt\), the standard addition operation \(+\),
and the constant 0 is a first-order structure.</p>

<p>
A <em>variable assignment</em> \(\mathsf{s}\) on the first-order
structure \(\mathfrak{M}\) is simply a function \(\mathsf{s}\colon
\textit{Var}\to \textrm{M}\). Each variable assignment extends
uniquely to a <em>denotation function for terms</em>, which is a
function \(v_\mathsf{s}\colon Tm\to \textrm{M}\) such that
\(v_\mathsf{s}(f(t_1, \dots, t_n))
=f^{\mathfrak{M}}(v_\mathsf{s}(t_1), \dots, v_\mathsf{s}(t_n))\) for
each function symbol \(f\) of arity \(n\) and each \(n\)-tuple of
terms \(t_1, \dots, t_n\). It remains to define what it means for a
formula \(\varphi\) to be <em>satisfied</em> in the first-order
structure \(\mathfrak{M}\) under the variable assignment
\(\mathsf{s}\), in symbols \(\mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\varphi\).
For atomic formulas, the definition of satisfaction is:</p>

\[
    \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash R(t_1, \dots, t_n) \ifft 
\left( v_\mathsf{s}(t_1), \dots, v_\mathsf{s}(t_n) \right) \in
R^{\mathfrak{M}}.
\]

<p>
For formulas which are conjunctions it is:</p> 
\[    \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\varphi \wedge \psi \ifft 
\mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\varphi \andt  \mathfrak{M},
\mathsf{s}\Vdash\psi.\]

<p>
For formulas which are negations it is:</p> 
\[
    \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\neg \varphi \ifft 
\mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\not\Vdash\varphi.
\]

<p>
Other propositional connectives are treated similarly (see the
 <a href="../logic-classical/">entry on classical first-order logic</a>).
 Finally, for formulas of the form \(\forall x \, \varphi\) the
definition of satisfaction is:</p> 
\[    \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\forall x \, \varphi \ifft  \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}[x{:=}a] \Vdash\varphi \text{ for all } a \in
\textrm{M},\]

<p>
where \(\mathsf{s}[x{:=}a]\) is the variable assignment which agrees
with \(\mathsf{s}\) on every variable other than \(x\) and sends the
variable \(x\) to the element \(a \in \textrm{M}\). Similarly, for
formulas of the form \(\exists x \, \psi\) the definition of
satisfaction is:</p> 
\[    \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\exists x \, \varphi \ifft  \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}[x{:=}a] \Vdash\varphi \text{ for some } a \in
\textrm{M}.
\]

<p>
A formula \(\varphi\) <em>holds in a first-order structure
\(\mathfrak{M}\)</em>, in symbols \(\mathfrak{M}\Vdash\varphi\), if
\(\mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\varphi\) for every variable
assignment \(\mathsf{s}\) on \(\mathfrak{M}\). For example, the
formula \(\forall x \, \forall y \, \exists z \, ((x \lt z) \wedge (z
\lt y))\), expressing the density of the order \(\lt\), holds in the
first-order structure \(\mathbb{Q}\) of the rational numbers. A
formula \(\varphi\) is <em>valid</em> in classical first-order logic
if it is valid in every first-order structure.</p>

<p>
The consequence relation of classical first-order logic can be defined
in two different ways. One definition states that \(\Pi
\vdash_{QCL}\Sigma\) if, for every first-order structure
\(\mathfrak{M}\),</p> 
\[
      \mathfrak{M}\Vdash\gamma \text{ for all } \gamma \in \Pi \quad\text{implies}\quad \mathfrak{M}\Vdash\delta \text{ for some } \delta \in \Sigma.\]

<p>
According to this definition of consequence, \(P(x)
\vdash_{QCL}P(y)\), where \(P\) is a unary relation symbol. The other
definition states that \(\Pi \vdash_{QCL} \Sigma\) holds if and only
if, for every first-order structure \(\mathfrak{M}\) and every
variable assignment \(\mathsf{s}\) on \(\mathfrak{M}\),</p>

\[
      \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\gamma \text{ for all } \gamma \in
\Pi \quad\text{implies}\quad \mathfrak{M}, \mathsf{s}\Vdash\delta \text{ for some
} \delta \in \Sigma.\]

<p>
According to this definition of consequence \(P(x)
\nvdash_{QCL}P(y)\), though \(\forall x \, P(x) \vdash_{QCL} \forall y
\, P(y)\). (The distinction between these two definitions corresponds
to the distinction between global vs. local consequence relations in
modal logic, discussed later.) For either definition of consequence, a
formula \(\varphi\) is valid (resp. anti-valid) in classical
first-order logic if and only if \(\emptyset \vdash_{QCL} \varphi\)
(resp. \(\varphi \vdash_{QCL} \emptyset\)).</p>

<h3 id="ManyValuFirsOrdeLogi">6.2 Many-valued first-order logics</h3>

<p>
There are a number of ways in which the semantics of classical
first-order logic can be extended to many-valued logics. In this
section, we introduce the widely adopted lattice-based semantics
proposed by Mostowski (1961), which interprets universal and
existential quantifiers, respectively, by suprema and infima. A more
recent account of this semantics, focusing on first-order G&ouml;del
and&#321;ukasiewicz logics, can be found in H&aacute;jek (1998).</p>

<p>
While this is not the most general type of semantics for many-valued
first-order logics, it is one of the simplest and it covers many of
the best known examples. A more general, matrix-based semantics, will
be introduced in the next section. These algebra-based and
matrix-based semantics are not the only possible kinds of semantics
for non-classical first-order logics. For instance, the semantics of
intuitionistic first-order logic is most commonly not given
algebraically, but rather in terms of so-called
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/#KripBethSemaForIntuLogi">Kripke semantics</a>.
 First-order G&ouml;del logic admits such a semantics too. A more
complicated kind of Kripke semantics also exists for many
substructural logics, including first-order
 <a href="../logic-relevance/#Semquant">relevance logics</a>,
 which form a prominent family of non-classical first-order logics
with a long research tradition (see Anderson, Belnap, &amp; Dunn
1992).</p>

<p>
For the sake of concreteness, let us consider the case of first-order
infinite-valued G&ouml;del logic without equality, building on our
previous discussion of propositional G&ouml;del logic in
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>.
 At the syntactic level, there is no difference compared to classical
logic: the formulas of first-order infinite-valued G&ouml;del logic
are precisely the same as the formulas of classical first-order logic.
At the level of first-order structures, the key observation is that a
relation \(R^{\mathfrak{M}} \subseteq \textrm{M}^{n}\) may equally
well be seen as a two-valued function \(R^{\mathfrak{M}}\colon
\textrm{M}^{n} \to \{ 0, 1 \}\), namely the characteristic function of
\(R^{\mathfrak{M}}\) as a subset of \(\textrm{M}^{n}\). Accordingly, a
<em>many-valued (G&ouml;del) relation</em> will be a function
\(R^{\mathfrak{M}}\colon \textrm{M}^{n} \to [0, 1]\). Replacing
ordinary relations by many-valued relations in the definition of
classical first-order structures then yields the definition of a
<em>many-valued (G&ouml;del) first-order structure</em>. As an
example, let us define a many-valued first-order structure
\(\mathbb{Q}_{\G}\) whose universe will again be the set of the
rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\). We interpret the binary function symbol
\(+\) and the constant symbol 0 in this first-order structure as
expected, but we put a many-valued spin on the binary relation
\({\lt}^{\mathbb{Q}_{\G}}\): we define \({\lt}^{\mathbb{Q}_{\G}}(x, y)
:= \mathsf{tr}(y - x)\), where \(\mathsf{tr}\) is the function which
takes a rational argument and truncates it at 0 or 1 if it falls
outside the unit interval. That is,</p> 
\[  \mathsf{tr}(r)  := 
\begin{cases}  1 \text{ if } r \geq 1, \\ 
 r \text{ if } 0 \lt r \lt 1, \\ 
 0 \text{ if } r \leq
0. \end{cases}\]

<p>
For example, the degree to which \(1 {\lt}^{\mathbb{Q}_{\G}} 1.3\)
holds is 0.3, reflecting the fact that 1.3 is slightly larger than 1,
while the degree to which \(1.3 {\lt}^{\mathbb{Q}_{\G}} 1\) holds is
0, reflecting the fact that 1 is not larger than 1.3.</p>

<p>
The notion of satisfaction needs to be upgraded, in a similar manner,
to a <em>many-valued satisfaction predicate</em>. While a two-valued
satisfaction predicate merely expresses whether or not a formula is
true, a many-valued satisfaction predicate expresses the degree of
truth of a formula. In other words, the former yields two-valued
statements, while the latter yields values in \([0, 1]\). This calls
for a change of notation from \(\mathfrak{M},
\mathsf{s}\Vdash\varphi\) to \(|| \varphi
||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}}\). The recursive definition of the
many-valued satisfaction predicate \(|| \cdot
||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}}\) goes as follows. For atomic formulas,
the definition of satisfaction is:</p> 
\[
      || R(t_1, \dots, t_n) ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}} :=
R^{\mathfrak{M}}(v_\mathsf{s}(t_1), \dots, v_\mathsf{s}(t_n)).\]

<p>
For formulas that are conjunctions it is:</p> 
\[|| \varphi \wedge \psi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}} := || \varphi
||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}} \wedge^{[0,1]_{\G}} || \psi
||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}},\]

<p>
where \(\wedge^{[0,1]}\) is the meet operation in the algebra of truth
values \([0,1]_{\G}\). Other propositional connectives are treated
similarly, using the other operations of the algebra \([0,1]_{\G}\)
(introduced in
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>).
 Finally, for formulas of the form \(\forall x \, \psi\) the
satisfaction function is defined as:</p> 
\[
      || \forall x \, \psi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}} := \bigwedge \{
|| \psi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}[x{:=}a]} \mid a \in M \}.\]

<p>
Similarly, for formulas of the form \(\exists x \, \psi\) it is
defined as:</p> 
\[      || \exists x \, \psi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}} := \bigvee \{ ||
\psi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}[x{:=}a]} \mid a \in M \}.
\]

<p>
Recall that \(\bigwedge X\) and \(\bigvee X\) denote respectively the
meet (greatest lower bound) and join (least upper bound) of a set
\(X\) in a lattice. The above definition relies on the fact that the
lattice \([0,1]_{\G}\) is <em>complete</em>, meaning that these bounds
exist in \([0,1]_{\G}\) for each set \(X \subseteq [0,1]_{\G}\).</p>

<p>
The definition of when a formula \(\varphi\) <em>holds in a
many-valued first-order structure</em> \(\mathfrak{M}\) and when it is
<em>valid</em> in first-order G&ouml;del logic are obtained from the
classical definitions if we replace \(\mathfrak{M},
\mathsf{s}\Vdash\varphi\) by \(|| \varphi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}}
= 1\). The same holds for the two definitions of consequence. For
example, the formula \(\forall x \, \forall y \, \exists z \, ((x \lt
z) \wedge (z \lt y))\) does not hold in the many-valued first-order
structure \(\mathbb{Q}_{\G}\) according to this definition, but the
formula \(\forall x \, \forall y \, ((x \lt y) \wedge (y \lt z)
\rightarrow (x \lt z))\) does. Similarly, we encourage the reader to
verify that these formulas are valid in first-order G&ouml;del
logic:</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
      \neg \neg \forall x \, P(x) &amp; \rightarrow \forall x \, \neg
\neg P(x), \\
 \forall x  (P(x) &amp; \rightarrow \exists y \, P(y)),
\end{align*}\]

<p>
but the following ones are not, in contrast to what happens in
classical logic:</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
       \forall x \, \neg \neg P(x) &amp; \rightarrow \neg \neg \forall x
\, P(x), \\
\exists x \, (P(x) &amp; \rightarrow \forall y \, P(y)).
\end{align*}\]

<p>
The latter formulas do, however, hold in each <em>finite</em>
many-valued (G&ouml;del) first-order structure.</p>

<p>
The above semantics clearly works for any algebra that has the
structure of a complete lattice in place of \([0,1]_{\G}\). For
instance, one may replace the algebra \([0,1]_{\G}\) associated with
G&ouml;del logic by the algebra \([0,1]_{\L}\) associated with
infinite-valued &#321;ukasiewicz logic \(\L_{\infty}\). The only
difference is in the stock of propositional connectives available in
the two logics: recall that \(\L_{\infty}\) distinguishes between the
connectives \(\wedge\) and \(\odot\), so accordingly the set of
formulas of first-order &#321;ukasiewicz logic is larger. The reader
may verify that for example all four of the above formulas are valid
in infinite-valued first-order &#321;ukasiewicz logic, while the
following formula is not valid:</p> 
\[
  \forall x \, (P(x) \odot Q(x)) \rightarrow (\forall x \, P(x) \odot
\forall x \, Q(x)).\]

<p>
These two logics (G&ouml;del and &#321;ukasiewicz), together with
intuitionistic first-order logic, are among the best studied
many-valued first-order logics. Nonetheless, some major questions
about them remain open, notably whether first-order G&ouml;del logic
has the Craig interpolation property.</p>

<p>
Though Mostowski&rsquo;s semantics is a simple generalization of the
familiar semantics of classical first-order logic, many-valued
first-order logics present challenges which do not arise in the
classical case. While at the semantic level, the difference between
infinite-valued first-order G&ouml;del and &#321;ukasiewicz logic is
just a matter of choosing between the algebras \([0,1]_{\G}\) and
\([0,1]_{\L}\), the two logics behave very differently when it comes
to their axiomatization. Scarpellini (1962), a mere year after
Mostowski proposed the above mentioned semantics, showed that
first-order &#321;ukasiewicz logic is not recursively axiomatizable,
though an axiomatization involving an infinitary rule was soon
identified by Hay (1963). This means that, unlike classical
first-order logic, first-order &#321;ukasiewicz logic cannot be
captured by any proof calculus. In fact, the situation is even worse:
almost <em>no</em> logic determined by a class of continuous t-norms
over the unit interval \([0, 1]\) (recall
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>)
 is recursively axiomatizable (see H&aacute;jek, Montagna, &amp;
Noguera 2011). The sole exception is first-order G&ouml;del logic,
which has a finite axiomatization due to Horn (1969). However, these
early results on axiomatizability notwithstanding, it is in fact only
relatively recently that the model theory of many-valued first-order
logics has become an object of systematic study, following the seminal
articles of H&aacute;jek and Cintula (2006) and Cintula, Diaconescu,
and Metcalfe (2009), covering results like the
L&ouml;wenheim&ndash;Skolem Theorem (see Dellunde,
Garc&iacute;a-Cerda&ntilde;a, &amp; Noguera 2016), Herbrand&rsquo;s
Theorem (see Cintula, Diaconescu, &amp; Metcalfe 2019), the Omitting
Types Theorem (see Badia &amp; Noguera 2021a), Lindstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s
Theorem (see Caicedo &amp; Iovino 2014 and Badia &amp; Noguera 2021b),
and zero&ndash;one laws (see Badia &amp; Noguera 2022 and Badia,
Caicedo, &amp; Noguera forthcoming). So-called continuous model theory
(see Ben Yaacov et al. 2008) also forms part of the model theory of
many-valued logics.</p>

<p>
Going beyond complete lattices as algebras of truth values to
arbitrary lattice-ordered algebras is possible, at the cost of
introducing some technical complications: one has to restrict to
so-called <em>safe</em> variable assignments, for which at least all
meets and joins required to compute the truth values of all
first-order formulas exist (see Cintula &amp; Noguera 2015). This
technical step becomes necessary when, instead of fixing a single
algebra of truth values, one allows for algebras of truth values
ranging over a whole variety of algebras. In this way, one can for
instance find a natural first-order counterpart of any propositional
substructural logic \(\L\) (recall
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>).
 To do so, one specifies for each many-valued first-order structure
\(\mathfrak{M}\) a particular algebra \(\mathbf{A}\) in the algebraic
counterpart \(\mathop{\mathrm{Alg}}\L\) of \(\L\) (or in some subclass
of \(\mathop{\mathrm{Alg}}\L\), such as the subclass of finitely
subdirectly irreducible algebras) such that many-valued relations in
\(\mathfrak{M}\), and accordingly also formulas evaluated in
\(\mathfrak{M}\), take values in the algebra \(\mathbf{A}\), which is
not necessarily a complete lattice. Different many-valued first-order
structures, however, may take values in different algebras
\(\mathbf{A}\). Such logics can be axiomatized in a uniform way given
an axiomatization of the propositional substructural logic \(\L\) (see
Cintula &amp; Noguera 2015).</p>

<p>
Some of the design choices made above of course have alternatives. As
in the propositional case, different definitions of consequence are
possible: above we chose a definition that generalizes the definition
of consequence in assertional logics
 (<a href="#TwoThreTrutValuGapsGlut">section 2.2</a>).
 This is a common choice in the literature, but one could equally
combine the same first-order semantics with a definition of
consequence corresponding, for instance, to logics of order. One could
also work in the context of first-order logic with equality. This
involves having a special binary relation symbol \(=\) and forcing a
particular interpretation on it. In the case of classical first-order
logic, it must be interpreted by the identity relation. Beyond the
two-valued case, there are again design choices to be made as to which
properties a many-valued identity relation must satisfy. One common
choice is to replace the binary identity relation (which tells us
whether or not two points in a first-order structure coincide) by a
metric (which tells us how far apart two points in a first-order
structure are).</p>

<h3 id="LogiDistQuan">6.3 Logics with distribution quantifiers</h3>

<p>
Reflection upon Mostowski&rsquo;s theory of
 <a href="../generalized-quantifiers/">generalized quantifiers</a>
 (see Mostowski 1957) shows a simple way in which more general kinds
of quantifiers may be interpreted in a many-valued setting. For an
example of how this goes, consider a many-valued first-order structure
\(\mathfrak{M}\) with domain \(\textrm{M}\), based on a logical matrix
\(\mathcal{M}\) with a universe \(V\) of truth values and a subset
\(D\) of designated values. Given a formula \(\varphi\) and a variable
\(x\), we define the <em>\(x\)-distribution</em> of \(\varphi\) with
respect to a variable assignment \(\mathsf{s}\) on \(\mathfrak{M}\)
as</p> 
\[      d^{\mathfrak{M}}_{\mathsf{s}, x}(\varphi) := \{ || \varphi
||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}[x := a]} \mid a \in \textrm{M} \}.\]

<p>
This definition says that the \(x\)-distribution of \(\varphi\) is the
set of all values \(\varphi\) may take as the denotation of \(x\)
ranges over \(V\), with the denotation of other variables being fixed.
(A further generalization of this semantics, corresponding more
directly to Mostowski&rsquo;s generalized quantifiers, would take the
distribution to be a <em>function</em> from the universe of
\(\mathfrak{M}\) to \(V\), rather than a subset of \(V\).) Each
quantifier symbol \(\mathsf{Q}\) is then semantically interpreted by a
function \(\mathsf{Q}^\mathcal{M}\) from the set of all non-empty sets
of truth values into the set of truth values. The semantic clause for
the quantifier \(Q\) then applies \(\mathsf{Q}^\mathcal{M}\) to the
distribution of \(\varphi\) as follows:</p> 
\[
      || \mathsf{Q}x \, \varphi ||^{\mathfrak{M},\mathsf{s}} :=
\mathsf{Q}^\mathcal{M}(d^{\mathfrak{M}}_{\mathsf{s}, x}(\varphi)).\]

<p>
This in particular covers the lattice-based quantifiers treated in the
previous section as a special case if we take \(\forall^\mathcal{M}(Z)
= \bigwedge Z\) and \(\exists^\mathcal{M}(Z) = \bigvee Z\).</p>

<p>
In general, <em>many-valued universal quantifiers</em> are taken to be
quantifiers \(\mathsf{Q}\) for which \(\mathsf{Q}^\mathcal{M}(Z)\in
D\) iff \(Z\subseteq D\), and <em>many-valued existential
quantifiers</em> are taken to be quantifiers \(\mathsf{Q}\) for which
\(\mathsf{Q}^\mathcal{M}(Z)\notin D\) iff \(Z\subseteq V\setminus D\).
For an illustration of what such quantifiers, called <em>distribution
quantifiers</em>, may look like in a three-valued setting for \(V = \{
0, \sfrac{1}{2}, 1 \}\), consider the following table:</p>

<table class="two-rulesTH cell-center cellpad-small center avoid-break" style="margin: 10px 30px; padding: 20px">

<p>
Taking \(D=\{\sfrac{1}{2},1\}\), the quantifiers \(\mathsf{Q}_1\) and
\(\mathsf{Q}_3\) are both many-valued universal quantifiers, while
\(\mathsf{Q}_2\) and \(\mathsf{Q}_4\) are both many-valued existential
quantifiers. The quantifiers \(\mathsf{Q}_1\) and \(\mathsf{Q}_2\) are
the ordinary lattice-based quantifiers we have seen before, but
\(\mathsf{Q}_3\) and \(\mathsf{Q}_4\) are not. As a matter of fact, in
Carnielli, Marcos, and de Amo (2000), the pair \(\mathsf{Q}_1\) and
\(\mathsf{Q}_2\) was associated to the first-order version of a
well-known three-valued paraconsistent logic called LFI1 (a
conservative expansion of LP by a classic-like implication and a unary
consistency operator), while the pair \(\mathsf{Q}_3\) and
\(\mathsf{Q}_4\) was associated to the first-order version of a
three-valued paraconsistent logic called LFI2 (a.k.a. Ciore). The
motivation behind this latter pair of quantifiers is to avoid
assigning the value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) to a formula unless necessary:
sentences in the propositional fragment of the latter logic take the
value \(\sfrac{1}{2}\) iff all their atomic components take that same
value, and that semantic behavior is directly exported from the
conjunction to the universal quantifier, and from the disjunction to
the existential quantifier.</p>

<p>
Well-behaved proof systems for finite-valued logics with distribution
quantifiers may be obtained using the method laid out in Carnielli
(1987). For semantics based on distributive lattices, in particular,
parsimonious axiomatizations may be obtained using the method in
H&auml;hnle (1998).</p>

<h3 id="ManyValuModaLogi">6.4 Many-valued modal logics</h3>

<p>
An important intermediate level between propositional and first-order
logic is occupied by
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logic</a>.
 The expressive power achieved by adding modalities to a propositional
logic does not entirely match that of first-order logic, but it is
quite sufficient for many purposes, including epistemic, temporal, and
spatial reasoning.</p>

<p>
Modal logic can be viewed as a fragment of first-order logic in the
sense that each modal formula translates into a first-order formula
(see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logic</a>
 or Andr&eacute;ka, N&eacute;meti, &amp; van Benthem 1998 for more
details.) Accordingly, many-valued modal logics may be studied as
fragments of many-valued first-order logics. However, they may also be
studied in their own right using a many-valued version of Kripke
semantics, which we now outline. This semantics is originally due to
Fitting (1991, 1992) and was later investigated more extensively and
at a more general level by Bou, Esteva, Godo, and Rodr&iacute;guez
(2011; though in both cases only the modal operator \(\Box\) is
considered).</p>

<p>
Let us again use the classical case, more precisely the case of
so-called normal classical modal logics, as a point of departure. The
modal syntax, in one of its common forms, adds two unary operators
\(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\) to the syntax of classical propositional
logic. The semantics is based on so-called <em>Kripke frames</em>,
which are pairs \(\mathfrak{F}= \langle W, R \rangle\) consisting of a
non-empty set \(W\) (of &lsquo;worlds&rsquo;) and a binary
<em>accessibility</em> relation \(R \subseteq W \times W\). A
<em>valuation</em> \(v\) on a Kripke frame \(\mathfrak{F}\) is then a
function \(v\colon W \times \Fm\to \{ 0, 1 \}\) such that the map
\(\varphi \mapsto v(w, \varphi)\) is a propositional valuation for
each \(w \in W\) and moreover</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
      v(w, \Box \varphi) = 1 &amp; \ifft  v(w', \varphi)
= 1 \text{ for every } w' \text{ such that } w R w', \\
      v(w, \Diamond \varphi) = 1 &amp; \ifft  v(w',
\varphi) = 1 \text{ for some } w' \text{ such that } w R w'.
  
\end{align*}\]

<p>
A formula \(\varphi\) is <em>valid in a frame \(\mathfrak{F}\)</em> if
\(v(w, \varphi) = 1\) for every valuation \(v\) on \(\mathfrak{F}\)
and every world \(w\) on \(\mathfrak{F}\), and it is valid in a class
of frames if it is valid in each frame in the class.</p>

<p>
When it comes to entailment, there are again two variants to choose
from. In <em>global consequence relation</em> associated with a class
of Kripke frames \(\mathsf{K}\) we have \(\Pi \vdash \Sigma\) if for
every Kripke frame \(\mathfrak{F}=\langle W, R \rangle\) in
\(\mathsf{K}\) and every valuation \(v\) on \(\mathfrak{F}\)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\((v(w, \gamma) = 1\) for all \(w \in W)\) for all \(\gamma \in \Pi\)
implies
<br />
\((v(w, \delta) = 1\) for all \(w \in W)\) for some \(\delta \in
\Sigma.\)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, in the local consequence relation we have \(\Pi \vdash
\Sigma\) if for every Kripke frame \(\mathfrak{F}=\langle W, R
\rangle\) in \(\mathsf{K}\), every valuation \(v\) on
\(\mathfrak{F}\), and every \(w \in W\)</p> 
\[
      v(w, \gamma) = 1 \text{ for all } \gamma \in \Pi \impliest
v(w, \delta) = 1 \text{ for some } \delta \in \Sigma.
\]

<p>
In particular, taking the class of all Kripke frames yields the global
and local versions of the basic normal modal logic \(K\), denoted
\(K^{\mathrm{g}}\) and \(K^{\ell}\), while taking the class of all
Kripke frames where \(R\) is an equivalence relation yields the global
and local versions of the modal logic S5. The characteristic
difference between global and local consequence is that the former but
not the latter validates the Necessitation rule: \(p
\vdash_{K^{\mathrm{g}}} \Box p\) but \(p \nvdash_{K^{\ell}} \Box
p\).</p>

<p>
Moving on to the many-valued case, we use &#321;ukasiewicz logic,
whose propositional version was introduced in
 <a href="#ContTrutValu">section 2.4</a>,
 as an example. The modal syntax again adds two unary operators
\(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\) to the propositional syntax, this time the
propositional syntax of &#321;ukasiewicz logic. A <em>many-valued
(&#321;ukasiewicz) Kripke frame</em> \(\mathfrak{F}\) consists of a
set \(W\) and a many-valued (&#321;ukasiewicz) binary relation on
\(W\), i.e., a function \(R\colon W \times W \to [0, 1]\). A
<em>valuation</em> on a many-valued Kripke frame is a function
\(v\colon W \times \Fm\to [0, 1]\) such that the map \(\varphi \mapsto
v(w, \varphi)\) is a propositional (&#321;ukasiewicz) valuation for
each \(w \in W\) and moreover</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
      v(w, \Box \varphi) &amp; = \bigwedge \{ R(w,w') \rightarrow
v(w', \varphi) \mid w' \in W \}, \\
      v(w, \Diamond \varphi) &amp; = \bigvee \{ R(w,w') \odot
v(w', \varphi) \mid w' \in W \},
\end{align*}\]

<p>
where the operations on the right-hand side are computed in the
algebra \([0,1]_{\L}\). The notion of validity and the global and
local consequence relations of the &#321;ukasiewicz modal logic
associated to a class of many-valued (&#321;ukasiewicz) Kripke frames
are now defined exactly as in the classical case. Clearly the
non-modal fragment of any such (non-trivial) logic is just the
infinite-valued &#321;ukasiewicz propositional logic.</p>

<p>
An important class of many-valued frames are the <em>crisp
frames</em>, where the accessibility relation is in fact two-valued,
i.e., \(R(w,w') \in \{ 0, 1 \}\). In that case, the semantic clauses
for the modal operators simplify to</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
      v(w, \Box \varphi) &amp; = \bigwedge \{ v(w', \varphi) \mid
w' \in W \text{ such that } R(w,w') = 1 \}, \\
      v(w, \Diamond \varphi) &amp; = \bigvee \{ v(w', \varphi) \mid
w' \in W \text{ such that } R(w,w') = 1 \}.
\end{align*}\]

<p>
As an example, the sentence \(\Box (p \odot p) \rightarrow (\Box p
\odot \Box p)\) holds in all crisp (&#321;ukasiewicz) frames, but not
in all many-valued frames. Restricting to the class of all crisp
frames where accessibility is an equivalence relation yields the
natural &#321;ukasiewicz counterpart of the logic S5. This logic is
related to first-order &#321;ukasiewicz logic in the same way that S5
is related to classical first-order logic, namely it amounts to its
one-variable fragment (see Cintula, Metcalfe, &amp; Tokuda 2024).</p>

<p>
The algebra \([0,1]_{\L}\) may of course be replaced by other algebras
to obtain other many-valued modal logics, such as G&ouml;del modal
logic in the case of the algebra \([0,1]_{\G}\) (see Caicedo &amp;
Rodr&iacute;guez 2015) or (crisp) modal Belnap&ndash;Dunn logic in the
case of the algebra \(\mathbf{\DM_4}\) (see Odintsov &amp; Wansing
2010). Notice that the semantics of general Kripke frames requires the
algebra to be equipped with well-behaved operators of implication and
fusion, while the semantics of crisp frames merely require the
structure of a complete lattice. In some cases, such as the classical
and &#321;ukasiewicz cases treated above, the modalities \(\Box\) and
\(\Diamond\) are interdefinable: we can treat \(\Diamond \varphi\) as
an abbreviation for \(\neg \Box \neg \varphi\), or \(\Box \varphi\) as
an abbreviation for \(\neg \Diamond \neg \varphi\). However, they fail
to be interdefinable, for instance, in G&ouml;del modal logic.</p>

<p>
Many-valued modal logics over an infinite algebra of truth values are
frequently worse behaved than the corresponding classical logics. In
particular, the task of axiomatizing them is often difficult, and
sometimes even impossible. Indeed, axiomatizations of G&ouml;del modal
logic and crisp G&ouml;del modal logic have only been obtained fairly
recently (see Caicedo &amp; Rodr&iacute;guez 2015; Rodr&iacute;guez
&amp; Vidal 2021), while in the &#321;ukasiewicz case we only have an
axiomatization of the logic of crisp frames, and this axiomatization
involves an infinitary rule (see Hansoul &amp; Teheux 2013). The
best-known modal logics are generally decidable, but this can fail
quite badly for some of their many-valued counterparts. For example,
although the local consequence relation of the modal logic of all
crisp &#321;ukasiewicz frames is decidable (see Vidal 2021), the
corresponding global consequence relation does not even enjoy the much
weaker property of being recursively axiomatizable (see Vidal 2022).
In contrast, an area where many-valued modal logics exhibit behavior
similar to classical modal logic is frame definability. In many
finite-valued modal logics, the classes of crisp frames definable by
modal formulas are precisely the same as those definable by modal
formulas in classical modal logic (see Badia, Caicedo, &amp; Noguera
2023).</p>
