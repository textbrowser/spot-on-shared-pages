<h1>Theodor W. Adorno</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon May 5, 2003; substantive revision Mon Nov 4, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Theodor W. Adorno (1903&ndash;1969) was one of the most important
philosophers, cultural, and music critics in Germany after World War
II. Although less well known among anglophone philosophers than many
of his contemporaries, such as Hans-Georg Gadamer, Adorno had even
greater influence on scholars and intellectuals in postwar Germany. In
the 1960s he was the most prominent challenger to both Sir Karl
Popper&rsquo;s philosophy of science and Martin Heidegger&rsquo;s
philosophy of existence. J&uuml;rgen Habermas, Germany&rsquo;s
foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno&rsquo;s student and
assistant. The current rise of national-populist and authoritarian
politics has led to renewed interest in his work on the social
psychology of the mass subject and anti-Semitism. The scope of
Adorno&rsquo;s influence stems from the interdisciplinary character of
his research and of Frankfurt University&rsquo;s Institute for Social
Research, where he worked. It also stems from his work as a
philosopher and critical theorist, from his large body of music
criticism, and from his role as a prominent cultural and social critic
and public intellectual in post-war West Germany.</p>

<p>
Unreliable translations hampered the initial reception of
Adorno&rsquo;s published work in English-speaking countries. Since the
1990s, however, better translations have appeared, along with newly
translated lectures and other posthumous works that are still being
published. These materials not only facilitate an emerging assessment
of his work in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, but also
strengthen an already substantial reception of his work in aesthetics
and cultural theory. Famous for their modernist, aphoristic style, for
instance, in <em>Minima Moralia</em>, and infamous for their
perplexing difficulty, for instance with assertions from that work
such as &ldquo;True thoughts are those alone which do not understand
themselves&rdquo; (1951a [2005, 192], reiterated in 1966a [1973, 48])
or &ldquo;philosophy is not expoundable&rdquo;
(<em>referierbar</em>, 1966a [1973, 33]) and &ldquo;no
philosophical thinking of quality allows of concise summary&rdquo;
(1965a [2005,131]), Adorno&rsquo;s texts continue to elicit scholarly
exegesis and philosophical commentary.</p>

<h2 id="BioSke">1. Biographical Sketch</h2>

<p>
Born on September 11, 1903 as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund, Adorno lived
in Frankfurt am Main for the first three decades of his life and the
last two (M&uuml;ller-Doohm 2005, Claussen 2008). He was the only
child of Oscar Wiesengrund, a wealthy German wine merchant of
assimilated Jewish background and Maria Calvelli-Adorno, a devout
Catholic of Corsican descent. Maria was an accomplished singer and her
sister, Agathe Calvelli-Adorno, who lived with the family, a talented
singer and pianist: together they provided Adorno a comfortable,
sheltered, and highly cultured childhood. As a young man he read Kant
and later philosophers weekly with the family friend and cultural
critic Siegfried Kracauer. Adorno studied philosophy with the
neo-Kantian Hans Cornelius in Frankfurt and music composition with
Alban Berg in Vienna. He completed his <em>Habilitationsschrift</em>
on Kierkegaard&rsquo;s aesthetics in 1931, under the supervision of
the left-wing socialist and Protestant theologian Paul Tillich and in
close intellectual friendship with Walter Benjamin. After just two
years as a university instructor (<em>Privatdozent</em>), he was
expelled by the Nazis, along with other professors of Jewish heritage
or on the political left. Through Benjamin in Berlin Adorno met Gretel
Karplus; they married in 1937 shortly before emigrating to the United
States.</p>

<p>
Having reduced his patronym (which has Jewish connotations) to the
initial W., Adorno left Germany in the spring of 1934. During the Nazi
era he resided in Oxford, New York City, and southern California.
There he wrote several books for which he later became famous,
including <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> (with Max Horkheimer),
<em>Philosophy of New Music</em>, <em>The Authoritarian
Personality</em> (a collaborative project), and <em>Minima
Moralia</em>. From these years come his provocative critiques of mass
culture and the culture industry. Adorno returned to Frankfurt in 1949
to take up a position in the philosophy and sociology departments (he
spent 1952&ndash;53 as research director of the Hacker Psychiatric
Foundation in Beverly Hills so as not to lose his US citizenship). He
quickly established himself as a leading German public intellectual
and a central figure in the Institute for Social Research, founded as
a free-standing center for Marxist scholarship in 1923. It provided
the hub to what has come to be known as Frankfurt School Critical
Theory, whose members or associates included Horkheimer, Adorno,
Benjamin, Friedrich Pollock, Otto Kirchheimer, Franz Neumann, Herbert
Marcuse, Leo Loewenthal, Erich Fromm, and others. Adorno became the
Institute&rsquo;s director in 1958, taking over from Horkheimer, who
had served as director since 1930. From the 1950s stem <em>In Search
of Wagner</em>, Adorno&rsquo;s ideology-critique of the Nazi&rsquo;s
favorite composer; <em>Prisms</em>, a collection of social and
cultural studies; <em>Against Epistemology</em>, a materialist
critique of Husserlian phenomenology; and the first volume of
<em>Notes to Literature</em>, a collection of essays in literary
criticism.</p>

<p>
Conflict and consolidation marked the last decade of Adorno&rsquo;s
life. A leading figure in the &ldquo;positivism dispute&rdquo; in
German sociology, Adorno was a key player in debates about
restructuring German universities and a lightning rod for both student
activists and their right-wing critics. These controversies did not
prevent him from publishing numerous volumes of music criticism, two
more volumes of <em>Notes to Literature</em>, books on Hegel and on
existential philosophy, and collected essays in sociology and in
aesthetics. <em>Negative Dialectics</em>, Adorno&rsquo;s magnum opus,
appeared in 1966. <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, the other magnum opus on
which he had worked throughout the 1960s, appeared posthumously in
1970. He died of a heart attack on August 6, 1969, one month shy of
his sixty-sixth birthday.</p>

<h2 id="EarWri">2. Early Writings</h2>

<p>
While studying composition with Eduard Steuermann in Frankfurt and
then with Alban Berg in Vienna, Adorno was also fulfilling the
institutional requirements to become an academic. Hitler&rsquo;s
seizure of power and the Nuremberg racial laws put an abrupt end to
those plans and forced him to leave Germany, but several of his
pre-exile writings during the 1930s, strongly influenced by Siegfried
Kracauer, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and above all Walter Benjamin, are
significant for understanding his overall philosophy (Buck-Morss
1977).</p>

<p>
In a short, posthumously published text from the early 1930s entitled
&ldquo;Theses on the Language of the Philosopher,&rdquo; Adorno
establishes a dilemma which his alternative linguistic theory will
obviate. On the one hand he rejects positivist (or
&ldquo;idealist&rdquo;) theories that sharply distinguish between
linguistic form and content, and treat things as merely
&ldquo;functions of thought,&rdquo; that is, inputs for conceptualist,
instrumental reason, and hence maintain that linguistic signification
is &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo;; the idealist philosophies of
&ldquo;atomized, disintegrated society&rdquo; treat truth as
adequation and knowledge as the subject&rsquo;s intentional
&ldquo;communicability&rdquo; of independent objects via language. On
the other hand he also rejects Heideggerian &ldquo;ontological&rdquo;
neologisms for their abstracting from concrete historical and social
relations and their sedimentation in words.</p>

<p>
Adorno outlines an alternative theory that maintains the necessary
inseparability of form and content and claims &ldquo;through language
history wins a share of truth&rdquo; because &ldquo;history and truth
meet in the word&rdquo; (1930s [2007, 35, 36]) according to the ideal
of an objective unity of material reality and linguistic expression in
the unique &ldquo;name&rdquo; for each thing. This &ldquo;linguistic
reality&rdquo; has historically become divided into the &ldquo;double
character of language&rdquo;: conceptualist, representational or
significatory use (&ldquo;communicability&rdquo;) and a
non-conceptual, evocative or gestural use (which Adorno will later
call &ldquo;expression&rdquo; [<em>Ausdruck</em>] and associate with
mimetic behavior and art). That is, &ldquo;concrete, objective&rdquo;
material history has become sedimented in linguistic form, and
&ldquo;truth,&rdquo; which Adorno conceives as disclosure and as
having an historically indexed epistemic access, is revealed by the
philosopher&rsquo;s &ldquo;hitting upon the word in which such truth
dwells at the historical hour&rdquo; (ibid., 36). In contrast to the
&ldquo;scientific dualism&rdquo; of word and thing, formal logic and
inference, Adorno calls for an explicitly &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;
method of &ldquo;configurative language&rdquo;: &ldquo;a dialectically
intertwined and explicatively indissoluable unity of concept and
thing&rdquo; (ibid., 38) which makes disclosive truth possible. In
<em>Negative Dialectics</em> he captures this idea with the claim that
&ldquo;In dialectics &hellip; the rhetorical element is on the side of
content&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 41]). Recent scholarship has attempted to
bring Adorno&rsquo;s thinking about language (and rationality) into
critical discussion with certain Wittgensteinian, pragmatist, and
neo-Hegelian strains of anglophone philosophy (Demmerling 1994;
Bernstein 2001, 2004; Bowie 2013; Hogh 2017; Freyenhagen 2023).</p>

<p>
In his 1931 inaugural lecture upon joining the University of Frankfurt
philosophy faculty, &ldquo;The Actuality of Philosophy,&rdquo; which
can be considered a kind of philosophical manifesto deeply indebted to
Benjamin as well as to modernist aesthetic responses to experience
under rationalized industrialization (Foster 2020), Adorno rejects
Heideggerian fundamental ontology for its implicit idealism and
logical positivism for its coercive restiction of experience (Gordon
2016, 37&ndash;83). Instead Adorno advocates philosophy as interpretation
(<em>Deutung</em>), likening it to riddle-solving: &ldquo;philosophy
has to bring its elements, which it receives from the sciences, into
changing constellations &hellip; into changing trial combinations
until they fall into a figure which can be read as an answer, while at
the same time the question disappears&rdquo; (1931 [1977, 127];
Pickford 2018). His example of the method and its materialist
commitment is the recognition by Marx of the structuring role of the
commodity form in bourgeois society. The method of discontinuous,
non-deductive presentation of material as a way to elicit recognition
of an essence underlying socio-historical, and ideological,
appearances operates throughout Adorno&rsquo;s writings, and is
elaborated and defended in the programmatic &ldquo;Essay as
Form&rdquo; (1958 [1991]), <em>Hegel: Three Studies</em> (1963a [1993,
109]), the introduction to <em>Negative Dialectics</em> (1966a [1973:
3&ndash;57]), and also thematically in <em>Aesthetic Theory</em> as the
&ldquo;enigmatic character&rdquo; of art (1970 [1997, 118&ndash;135]).</p>

<p>
In his 1932 posthumously published paper &ldquo;The Idea of Natural
History&rdquo; Adorno outlines a philosophy of history comprised of
the opposition between figures of necessity and contingency.
&ldquo;Nature&rdquo; is &ldquo;what has always been, what as fatefully
arranged pre-given being underlies history and appears within history;
it designates what is substantial within history&rdquo;; it names what
is taken to be immutable, necessary, and identical.
&ldquo;History&rdquo; is &ldquo;a movement that does not play itself
out in pure identity, but is one in which the new occurs and gains its
true character through what appears in it as new&rdquo; (1932 [1984,
111]); it is characterized as the new, contingent, non-identical
vis-&agrave;-vis the &ldquo;ever-same&rdquo; of nature. The
relationship between these moments is one of dialectical but
&ldquo;discontinuous&rdquo; tension (ibid., 122<strong>)</strong>:
what appears to be fateful and natural might be revealed to have been
produced historically as &ldquo;second nature&rdquo; and hence
contingent; and the new, the advent of the historical, can itself
ossify and become second nature. The critic must interpret the
semblance of reality as &ldquo;cipher&rdquo; and &ldquo;riddle&rdquo;
to reveal the inherent discrete potentials of &ldquo;transience&rdquo;
(<em>Verg&auml;ngnis</em>) (Macdonald 2019a, 58&ndash;68). The
non-teleological, non-linear and non-synthesizing philosophy of
history named &ldquo;nature-history&rdquo; recurs in later writings by
Adorno (and Benjamin), e.g. the essay &ldquo;Progress&rdquo; (1964
[2005]), the lecture course <em>History and Freedom</em> (1964&ndash;65
[2006]), and <em>Negative Dialectics</em>: &ldquo;History is the unity
of continuity and discontinuity&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 320]). Recent
thinkers have interpreted the account as a &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo;
heuristic for criticizing reality (Whyman 2016) and put the account to
work in developing a non-Hegelian idea of historical progress (Allen
2016; Jaeggi 2023).</p>

<p>
Adorno&rsquo;s <em>Habilitationsschrift</em>, <em>Kierkegaard:
Construction of the Aesthetic</em>, written 1929&ndash;1930 under the
direction of Paul Tillich and the influence of Luk&aacute;cs and
Benjamin (Morgan 2012, 15&ndash;64) and published in 1933, pursues a
&ldquo;redemptive critique&rdquo; of the Danish philosopher&rsquo;s
writings, which due to their focus on individual existence, were
enjoying a revival in existentialist circles, including
Heidegger&rsquo;s fundamental ontology. Occupying the lowest condition
within his three-stage dialectical development of the individual
subject (aesthetic, ethical, religious), the aesthetic is
characterized by Kierkegaard as the realm and attitude of subjective
immediacy, hedonism, and irrationality from which the individual
consciousness in a state of pure &ldquo;inwardness&rdquo;
dialectically advances to a self-relation preparatory to a &ldquo;leap
into faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
With his book Adorno sought to attack the validity of existentialism,
to present a Marxist alternative by analyzing &ldquo;existence&rdquo;
as a social, rather than individual, category, and to revalue
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s dismissal of the aesthetic by showing how it can
be interpreted to reveal objective, social-historical truth. He shows
how Kierkegaard&rsquo;s abstract, idealist inwardness and
&ldquo;objectless dialectic&rdquo; is unintentionally permeated by
socio-historical concrete objectivity. Adorno does this by
constructing &ldquo;objective images&rdquo; in taking
&ldquo;literally&rdquo; the metaphors in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s texts:
for example, the <em>int&eacute;rieur</em> of the bourgeois apartment
which &ldquo;serves only as a metaphor for the nexus of his
fundamental concepts. The relation is reversed as soon as
interpretation gives up the compulsion of identity [exerted by
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s thought]&hellip;&rdquo; (1933 [1989, 41]).
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s intended use of the image of the &ldquo;window
mirror&rdquo; in apartment interiors &ndash; to invoke speculative
reflection &ndash; is belied by the unintended presence of the
socio-historical world within the apartment, for &ldquo;the function
of the window mirror is to project the endless row of apartment
buildings into the isolated bourgeois living room; by the mirror, the
living room dominates the reflected row at the same time that it is
delimited by it &ndash; just as in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s philosophy the
&lsquo;situation&rsquo; [the concept of what the completely
self-sufficient subject decides upon] is subordinated to subjectivity
and yet is defined by it&rdquo; (ibid., 42) However, the external
world of social production and circulation, as mirrored reflections or
bourgeois decorations, is present merely as images &ndash; semblance
&ndash;, abstracted from use and appearing as timeless &ldquo;second
nature&rdquo; to the &ldquo;objectless inwardness&rdquo; of
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s dialectic of individual subjectivity, thereby
revealing the &ldquo;truth content,&rdquo; the concrete historical
conditions indirectly expressed within Kierkegaard&rsquo;s spiritual
dialectic of individual self-abnegation (Buck-Morss 1977, 111-121).
Adorno as it were resurrects and revalues the lowly aesthetic sphere,
by finding the &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; character of hope for redemption
in the loss of the concrete, the fragmentary, the enigmatic that is
cast aside in the dialectic of &ldquo;objectless
inwardness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Scholars have pointed out the influence of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
anti-Hegelianism and philosophical style on Adorno (Morgan 2020) as
well as the sympathetic bond underlying early Adorno&rsquo;s critique,
in that Kierkegaard&rsquo;s philosophy of immediate interiority was a
reaction against bourgeois reification inaugurating high capitalism
(Gordon 2016).</p>

<h2 id="DiaEnl">3. Dialectic of Enlightenment</h2>

<p>
Written by Adorno and Horkheimer from 1939&ndash;1944 while in wartime exile
in California, <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> pursues a critique
of reason, society, and the self in Western modernity. An initial,
hectographic version, accurately entitled <em>Philosophical
Fragments</em>, appeared in 1944 in limited quantity. This title
became the subtitle when a second version, which mitigated the
Marxist, economic vocabulary, was published in 1947 (see editorial
apparatus in 1947 [2002, 217&ndash;282]). &ldquo;Adorno frequently mentioned
that he saw all his later major writings as excursuses to
<em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>&rdquo; (Schweppenh&auml;user 2009,
32).</p>

<p>
Their book opens with a grim assessment of the modern West:
&ldquo;Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of
thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and
installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth is
radiant with triumphant calamity&rdquo; (1947 [2002, 1]). While it is
presumed that &ldquo;freedom in society is inseparable from
enlightenment thinking&rdquo; (ibid., xvi), the development of reason,
including the historical period of the Enlightenment in its attempt to
liberate people from their self-incurred immaturity, has led to a
reversal: the book aims to explain &ldquo;why humanity, instead of
entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of
barbarism&rdquo; (ibid., xiv). As a genealogy of reason, the book
recounts the emergence of enlightenment thinking from prior magical
and mythological phases of humankind&rsquo;s history on to its
predominant form as instrumental (Weber&rsquo;s
&lsquo;formal-purposive&rsquo;) reason, the means-end calculation that
prevails in industrial capitalism and bureaucratic rationalization
such that &ldquo;enlightenment is totalitarian&rdquo; (ibid., 5) and
the &ldquo;disenchanted&rdquo; world takes on qualities of myth:
complete immanence dominated by obscure and overpowering
fatefulness.</p>

<p>
The central claims of the book are that myth and enlightenment,
traditionally held to be mutually exclusive concepts governing
successive stages in Hegelian historiography, are actually entangled
at each stage of reason&rsquo;s development. Thus the two theses,
&ldquo;myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to
mythology&rdquo; (ibid,, xviii), are expounded via an
anthropologically inflected periodization. In prehistory,
&ldquo;neither [the unity of nature] nor the unity of the subject was
presupposed&rdquo; (ibid., 6), rather there is a fluidity between them
governed by mimesis, &ldquo;the organic adaption to otherness&rdquo;:
the human seeks to resemble nature by embodying particular qualities
(ibid., 148; on the concept of mimesis, see Fr&uuml;chtl 2024). Driven
by self-preservation in the face of &ldquo;mythic fear,&rdquo; rituals
develop which rely on sacrificial substitution (say, a hind for a
daughter) to propitiate the gods and control, dominate nature, thereby
inaugurating representation, exchangeability, abstraction: &ldquo;The
substitution which takes place in sacrifice marks a step towards
discursive logic&rdquo; (ibid., 6). The tendency intensifies during
the historical Enlightenment, in which Kantian epistemology envisages
a world of sensuous particulars given in intuition that are subsumed
as mere instances under universal concepts operative in abstract laws
of nature: what Adorno comes to call &ldquo;identity-thinking&rdquo;
(Bernstein 2001, 75&ndash;234). The result is &ldquo;the single relationship
between the subject who confers meaning and the meaningless object,
between rational signification and its accidental bearer&rdquo; and a
closed world of immanence: &ldquo;Just as myths already entail
enlightenment, with every step enlightenment entangles itself more
deeply in mythology&hellip; The principle of immanence, the
explanation of every event as repetition, which enlightenment upholds
against mythical imagination, is that of myth itself&rdquo; (ibid., 7,
8). This development also entails the polarization between
science/technology and art: &ldquo;as sign [in science], language must
resign itself to being calculation and, to know nature, must renounce
the claim to resemble it. As image it must resign itself to being a
likeness and, to be entirely nature, must renounce the claim to know
it&rdquo; (ibid., 13). The image, based on sensuous, qualitative
resemblance given in intuition, becomes art, a &ldquo;refuge&rdquo;
for mimetic comportment (1970 [1997: 53&ndash;54]).</p>

<p>
The dialectic of enlightenment has phylogenetic and ontogenetic
consequences for subject formation, which are explicated in the
book&rsquo;s reading of the <em>Odyssey</em> as a &ldquo;basic text
[<em>Grundtext</em>] of European civilization&rdquo; (ibid., 37).
Odysseus exemplifies the Western subject&rsquo;s failed attempts to
escape the fateful world of mythic powers and thus &ldquo;the hero
turns out to be the prototype [<em>Urbild</em>] of the bourgeois
individual&rdquo; (ibid., 36), whereby &ldquo;the history of
civilization is the history of the introversion of sacrifice &hellip;
the history of renunciation&rdquo; (ibid., 43). Emblematic of this
thesis is Odysseus&rsquo;s and his crew&rsquo;s sacrifices to sail
safely past the sirens, mythical creatures who by their sensuous song
lure seafarers to their doom. Odysseus commands his rowers to stop up
their ears and binds himself to the ship&rsquo;s mast. Forcing himself
to become thing-like, he is promised happiness by the sirens, but it
is merely the semblance of happiness, while the rowers, living
laborers, are denied even that experience. Thus &ldquo;the formation
of the self severs the fluctuating connection with nature [mimesis],
which the sacrifice of the self is supposed to establish&rdquo;
(ibid., 41), and which suspends the goals of rationality to be
realized in human history: &ldquo;At the moment when human beings cut
themselves off from the consciousness of themselves as nature, all the
purposes for which they keep themselves alive &ndash; social progress,
the heightening of material and intellectual forces, indeed,
consciousness itself &ndash; become void, and the enthronement of the
means as the end, which in late capitalism is taking on the character
of overt madness, is already detectable in the earliest history of
subjectivity&rdquo; (ibid., 42&ndash;43).</p>

<p>
The book&rsquo;s bleak description of the enthronement of instrumental
reason and the resulting pathologies &ndash; domination of external
and internal nature, social and economic oppression, reification, etc.
&ndash; should not, however, lead one to assimilate it to the cultural
pessimism of Spengler or Klages, nor should the book&rsquo;s
invocation of &ldquo;dialectic&rdquo; lead one to assimilate it
completely to the teleological Hegelian dialectic of <em>Phenomenology
of Spirit</em> with its linear, triumphalist historiography of the
realization of social freedom. The entanglement of myth and
enlightenment is such that the dialectic has been suspended (ibid.,
32) or, to speak with Benjamin, is &ldquo;at a standstill.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;self-destruction of the enlightenment&rdquo; constitutes an
&ldquo;aporia&rdquo; (ibid., xvi) and the book speaks at most of
intending &ldquo;to prepare a positive concept of enlightenment which
liberates it from its entanglement in blind domination&rdquo; (ibid.,
xviii). To do so the book (and Adorno&rsquo;s subsequent writings)
uses metalogical elements of the Hegelian dialectic: determinate
negation and conceptual self-reflection. &ldquo;Determinate
negation&rdquo; (<em>bestimmte</em> <em>Negation</em>) is a productive
negation (it has determinate content) that immanently emerges from
cognitive failure, contradiction, etc., by rethinking conceptual
presuppositions, contexts of application, etc. that &ndash; for Adorno
&ndash; include material, societal conditions (ibid., 18). Hegelian
conceptual self-reflection or &ldquo;the self-reflection of
thought&rdquo; (<em>der Begriff als Selbstbesinnung des Denkens</em>,
ibid., 32), acknowledges the self-conscious spontaneous activity of
thought, an essential element of autonomy.</p>

<p>
In the &ldquo;Preface&rdquo; Horkheimer and Adorno emphasize their
reliance on these potentials within thought: &ldquo;if enlightenment
does not assimilate reflection on this regressive moment [in
rationality], it seals its own fate&rdquo; (ibid., xvi);
&ldquo;intellect&rsquo;s true concern is a negation of
reification&rdquo; and &ldquo;the necessity for enlightenment to
reflect on itself if humanity is not to be totally betrayed&rdquo;
(ibid., xvii). There are passages in the book where these Hegelian
elements indicate possibilities to exit the aporia. In a chapter on
enlightenment and morality, the authors show that the same form of
reason, oriented towards abstraction, formalism, and rational
self-restriction, inhabits the moral rigorism and disregard of the
senses in Kant&rsquo;s ethics and in the mechanically orchestrated
libertinage of the Marquis de Sade; thereby the authors construct just
such an opportunity for the self-reflection of thought: &ldquo;In
taking fright at the image in its own mirror, that thought opens to
view what lies beyond it &hellip; it is the fact that Sade did not
leave it to his enemies to be horrified by the Enlightenment which
makes his work pivotal to its rescue&rdquo; (ibid., 92). As with
determinate negation, thought&rsquo;s self-reflection is also extended
into materialism by Adorno: reflection can reveal that thought arises
from the very corporeal needs and desires that get forgotten when
thought becomes a mere instrument of human self-preservation. It also
reveals that the goal of thought is not to continue the blind
domination of nature and humans but to point toward reconciliation.
Thus only a &ldquo;remembrance of nature within the subject&rdquo;
(ibid., 32), for instance the mimetic impulse as a receptivity to
sensuousness, particularity, whatever eludes the subsumptive
classifications of identity-thinking &ndash; what Adorno calls
&ldquo;the non-identical&rdquo; &ndash; can preserve the self from its
reduction to compulsive self-preservation and domination.</p>

<p>
Habermas inaugurated an influential line of criticism by objecting to
the supposed conflation of instrumental rationality with rationality
<em>tout court</em> and rationality with power, and argued for a
perceived &ldquo;normative deficit&rdquo; in critical theory as
practiced in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>: &ldquo;it denounces
the Enlightenment&rsquo;s becoming totalitarian with its own tools.
Adorno was quite aware of this performative contradiction [i.e., a
contradiction between the act of assertion and the content of the
assertion] inherent in totalized critique&rdquo; (1987, 119);
practicing &ldquo;a critique that attacks the presuppositions of its
own validity,&rdquo; the book&rsquo;s arguments have no
&ldquo;ultimate groundings&rdquo; or &ldquo;normative
foundations&rdquo; and must &ldquo;therefore eschew theory and
practice determinate negation on an ad hoc basis&rdquo; (ibid., 128,
129). Habermas&rsquo;s own positive theory argues for, alongside
instrumental (strategic) rationality, intersubjective communicative
rationality oriented toward mutual understanding
(<em>Verst&auml;ndigung</em>) that relies on normative presuppositions
and the regulative ideal of the &ldquo;unforced force of the better
argument&rdquo; (Habermas 1984; see also Benhabib 1986). For a defense
of Adorno&rsquo;s &ldquo;ad hoc&rdquo; ideology critique against
Habermas&rsquo;s more Kantian variety, see Geuss (1981).</p>

<p>
More recently, Allen resists the claim of performative contradiction,
emphasizing that the &ldquo;aporia&rdquo; and ambivalence at the heart
of the book encourages us to remain &ldquo;as mindful of the dangers
of enlightenment as we are of our commitment to it&rdquo; (2014, 22),
while Noppen (2012) interprets the text as preparation for, but not
yet elaboration of, a positive concept of enlightenment, and
Zuidervaart (2007, chap.4) urges distinctions in the scope of
domination and exploitation invoked in the text. Honneth interprets
the text as a disclosive critique that uses rhetorical means
(narration, myth, chiasmus, exaggeration, etc.) &ldquo;in order to
evoke a new way of seeing the social world&rdquo; (2000, 124), an
approach extended by Freyenhagen &rsquo;s (2024) reading of the text
as a fictional performance, rather than merely critical description,
of the defining aporias of modernity&rsquo;s self-understanding.
Hulatt (2016a) interprets the book&rsquo;s genealogy not as an
internally driven development from mimesis to instrumental rationality
but rather as a more complex, tripartite conflict between mimesis,
rationality, but also self-preservation as a controlling and ordering
principle, which ultimately is relaxed in bourgeois autonomous
art&rsquo;s incorporation of mimesis. Both Hulatt (2016b) and Shuster
(2014, 7&ndash;41, and 2022) highlight the Kantian epistemology animating
<em>Dialectic</em>; Hulatt reads the historical account as a genealogy
of transcendental idealism, while Shuster argues that the book&rsquo;s
genealogical account identifies problematic aspects of Kantian
self-consciousness and practical agency.</p>

<h2 id="CriSocThe">4. Critical Social Theory</h2>

<p>
<em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> presupposes a critical social
theory indebted to Karl Marx and Max Weber. Adorno reads Marx as a
Hegelian materialist whose critique of capitalism unavoidably includes
a critique of the ideologies that capitalism sustains and requires.
The most important of these is what Marx called &ldquo;the fetishism
of commodities&rdquo;: &ldquo;The social character of activity as well
as the social form of the product, and the share of individuals in
production here appear as something alien and objective&rdquo;;
&ldquo;a definite social relation between men assumes the
phantasmagoric form of a relation between things&rdquo; (quoted in
Rose 2024, 33). Marx aimed his critique of commodity fetishism against
bourgeois social scientists who simply describe the capitalist economy
as though it were a natural reality but, in so doing, simultaneously
misdescribe it and prescribe a false social vision. According to Marx,
bourgeois economists necessarily ignore the exploitation intrinsic to
capitalist production. They fail to understand that capitalist
production, for all its surface &ldquo;formal freedom&rdquo; and
&ldquo;equality in exchange,&rdquo; must extract surplus value from
the coerced labor of the working class. Like ordinary producers and
consumers under capitalist conditions, bourgeois economists treat the
commodity as a fetish. They treat it as if it were a positively given,
neutral object, with an inherent value, that directly relates to other
commodities, in independence from the human interactions that actually
sustain all commodities. Marx, by contrast, argues that whatever makes
a product a commodity goes back to human needs, desires, and
practices. The commodity would not have &ldquo;use value&rdquo; if it
did not satisfy human wants and needs; it would not have
&ldquo;exchange value&rdquo; if no one wished to exchange it for
something else. And its exchange value could not be calculated if the
commodity did not share with other commodities a &ldquo;value&rdquo;
created by the expenditure of human labor power and measured by the
socially necessary labor time that is abstracted from the average
concrete labor needed to produce commodities of various sorts.</p>

<p>
Adorno&rsquo;s social theory attempts to make Marx&rsquo;s central
insights applicable to &ldquo;late capitalism.&rdquo; Although in
agreement with Marx&rsquo;s analysis of the commodity, Adorno thinks
his critique of commodity fetishism does not go far enough.
Significant changes have occurred in the structure of capitalism since
Marx&rsquo;s time, which require revisions on a number of topics: the
dialectic between forces of production and relations of production;
the relationship between state and economy; the sociology of classes
and class consciousness; the nature and function of ideology; and the
role of expert cultures, such as modern art and social theory, in
criticizing capitalism and calling for the transformation of society
as a whole.</p>

<p>
The primary clues to these revisions come from a theory of reification
proposed by the Hungarian philosopher Georg Luk&aacute;cs in the 1920s
and from interdisciplinary projects and debates conducted by members
of the Institute for Social Research in the 1930s and 1940s. Building
on Max Weber&rsquo;s theory of rationalization, Luk&aacute;cs argues
that the capitalist economy is no longer one sector of society
alongside others. Rather, commodity exchange has become the central
organizing principle for all sectors of society. This allows commodity
fetishism to permeate all social institutions (e.g., economic, legal,
political, cultural, etc.) as well as all academic disciplines,
including philosophy. &ldquo;Reification&rdquo; refers to the
historical situation when the commodity form &ldquo;becomes the
universal category of society as a whole&rdquo; such that &ldquo;a
man&rsquo;s [sic] own activity, his own labor becomes something
objective and independent of him, something that controls him by
virtue of an autonomy alien to man&rdquo; (Luk&aacute;cs 1971, 86,
87).</p>

<p>
Initially Adorno shared this concern, even though he never had
Luk&aacute;cs&rsquo;s confidence that the revolutionary working class
could overcome reification. Later Adorno called the reification of
consciousness an &ldquo;epiphenomenon&rdquo;: what a critical social
theory really needs to address is why hunger, poverty, and other forms
of human suffering persist despite the technological and scientific
potential to mitigate them or to eliminate them altogether. The root
cause, Adorno says, lies in how capitalist relations of production
have come to dominate society as a whole, leading to extreme, albeit
often invisible, concentrations of wealth and power (1966a [1973,
189&ndash;92]). Society has come to be organized around the production
of exchange values for the sake of producing exchange values, which,
of course, always already requires a silent appropriation of surplus
value. Adorno refers to this nexus of production and power as the
&ldquo;principle of exchange&rdquo; (<em>Tauschprinzip</em>); society
where this nexus prevails is an &ldquo;exchange society&rdquo;
(<em>Tauschgesellschaft</em>). Adorno&rsquo;s diagnosis of the
exchange society has three levels: politico-economic, cultural, and
social-psychological.</p>

<h3 id="PolEco">4.1 Political Economy</h3>

<p>
Adorno&rsquo;s writings are premised on the claim that the liberal or
free market capitalism characteristic of the 19<sup>th</sup> century
has been superseded by &ldquo;late&rdquo; or &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;
capitalism &ndash; a tendency beginning with the global financial
crisis of 1873, when industries and utilities consolidated into
trusts, monopolies, and cartels &ndash;, and eventually &ldquo;state
capitalism,&rdquo; as the economic &ldquo;base&rdquo; became
increasingly coordinated with the state. The theory of
&ldquo;administered&rdquo; or &ldquo;state capitalism&rdquo; was
developed in a series of articles by Friedrich Pollock, an economist
and Institute member who was supposed to contribute a chapter to
<em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> but never did (Wiggershaus 1994,
313&ndash;19). Pollock argued that during the inter-war years in
fascist Germany, the Soviet Union, and welfare-state USA, planning and
regulation by the state sought to administer production, distribution,
and consumption, resulting in increasingly rationalized and
bureaucratized political, economic, social and cultural spheres of
society, and the emergence of the social category of the
&ldquo;mass&rdquo; subject.</p>

<p>
While during the liberal stage of capitalism, the proletariat existed
&ldquo;half outside&rdquo; society and thus for Luk&aacute;cs
possessed the potential of class consciousness and revolutionary
activity as the &ldquo;subject of history,&rdquo; in late capitalism
society had become &ldquo;totally integrated&rdquo; and
&ldquo;societized&rdquo; (<em>vergesellschaftet</em>, a concept from
Weber), either in a totalitarian or democratic form (Adorno 1966b
[1969]). Because &ldquo;material production, distribution, consumption
are administered jointly&hellip; The totality of the processes of
mediation, which amounts in reality to the principle of exchange, has
produced a second, deceptive immediacy. This enables people to ignore
the evidence of their own eyes and forget the difference and conflict
or repress it from consciousness &hellip; No overall social subject
exists&rdquo; (Adorno 1969a <strong>[</strong>2003, 124, trans.
mod.]). The &ldquo;integration&rdquo; of society (e.g., the
&ldquo;safety net&rdquo; in welfare-state democracies integrates the
proletariat) eliminates the possibility of external or
&ldquo;transcendent&rdquo; social critique, thus &ldquo;immanent
criticism&rdquo; or &ldquo;determinate negation&rdquo; becomes
Adorno&rsquo;s primary method: &ldquo;It is no longer possible to
adopt a vantage point outside the mechanism that would enable us to
give the horror a name; one can tackle it only where it is
inconsistent with itself&rdquo; (ibid., trans. mod.). While Pollock
claimed that state capitalism effectively neutralized class conflict
and softened economic crises, in the 1940s Adorno criticized him for
inadequately appreciating that not only did society remain
antagonistic, but that class division (based who does and does not own
the means of production) and the asymmetries in political power had
intensified in late capitalism, though accompanied by intensified
ideological veiling that Adorno associates with fascism: &ldquo;The
latest phase of class society is dominated by monopolies; it tends
toward fascism, the form of political organization worthy of it. While
it vindicates the doctrine of class struggle with its concentration
and centralization, extreme power and extreme impotence directly
confronting one another in total contradiction, it makes people forget
the actual existence of hostile classes &hellip; The total
organization of society by big business and its ubiquitous technology
has taken such utter possession of the world and the imagination that
even to conceive of the idea that things might be otherwise calls for
an almost hopeless effort&rdquo; (Adorno 1942a [2003a, 96]; Cook
1998). Furthermore, no appeal to basic invariant human needs (as in
orthodox Marxism) can be made because needs are thoroughly societally
mediated: nature and history are inextricably intertwined (Adorno
1942b [2017]). These features of integrated society under state
capitalism tend to thwart the emergence of a proletarian class
consciousness (Hammer 2005, 54&ndash;65; Braunstein 2023).</p>

<h3 id="Cul">4.2 Culture</h3>

<p>
The theory that the social totality is integrated includes one of
early Frankfurt School&rsquo;s most influential concepts, that of the
&ldquo;culture industry.&rdquo; Orthodox Marxism held that culture, as
part of the superstructure, is in some way determined by and reflects
the economic base (e.g., relations of production). While
&lsquo;authentic&rsquo; modernist artworks show relatively greater
autonomy from society, individually requiring cognitively exacting and
affectively nuanced interpretation of their meaning (see section
&ldquo;Aesthetic Theory&rdquo;), &ldquo;Film, radio, and magazines
form a system. Each branch is unanimous within itself and all are
unanimous together&rdquo; (1947 [2002, 94]). Produced for the masses,
such products interchangeably follow the general logic of the
commodity-form under late capitalism: they are planned to produce
certain effects (titillation, distraction, excitement) devoid of
larger significance, for their use-value has been replaced by their
exchange value.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Culture industry,&rdquo; in stark contrast from spontaneously
produced &ldquo;popular&rdquo; or &ldquo;folk&rdquo; art, primarily
refers to how forms of entertainment function in mass society (1967a
[1991, 100ff].): how they are rationalized and standardized in
production, distribution, and consumption, according to the
&ldquo;cycle of manipulation and retroactive need&rdquo; (1947 [2002,
95]). Because mass cultural products function as commodities, they
duplicate and reinforce empirical social reality, they pursue
&ldquo;the idolization of the existing order&rdquo; (ibid., xix):
&ldquo;On all sides, the borderline between culture and empirical
reality becomes more and more indistinct&rdquo; (1942c [1991, 61]).
Under liberal capitalism there was a gap between socio-economic
reality within which immanent ideology critique could be pursued. Now,
cultural products simply duplicate reality, a kind of integration of
ideology into the social totality, and there is less and less
opportunity for straightforward immanent critique.</p>

<p>
In the first essay Adorno wrote in the USA, &ldquo;On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression of Listening,&rdquo; he develops
the idea of fetish, from Marx&rsquo;s commodity fetishism, in light of
the workings of radio music and music recordings, which he studied
while working for Paul Lazarsfeld and the Princeton Radio Project. The
&ldquo;fetish character&rdquo; Adorno emphasized comprised the fact
that hit songs are evaluated based on the profit they bring as much as
the quality of the song, and the fact that consumers listen
&ldquo;regressively,&rdquo; that is, passively to discrete sensory
effects without active intellectual engagement with the product as a
complex whole (1938 [1991, 32&ndash;3]). Nor is it simply a matter of
culturally produced ideological blindness requiring
consciousness-raising, as in the earlier stage of capitalism;
consumers see through the deception but self-preservation leads them
to reify themselves to better adapt to the social totality anyways. In
this way too the culture industry &ldquo;impedes the development of
autonomous, independent individuals who judge and decide consciously
for themselves&rdquo; (1967a [1991,104&ndash;6]; cf. 1947 [2002, 135&ndash;6]).
Subsequent commentators have sought to elaborate the cognitive and
psychological complexities at work in Adorno&rsquo;s account of
consumers&rsquo; reception and in light of arguably changed cultural
conditions (Cook 1996; Gunster 2000). Thanks to these complexities,
Horkheimer and Adorno see fleeting possibilities for resistence within
the integration of culture, for instance in an archaic layer of
&ldquo;stubbornly purposeless&rdquo; activities such as the
carnivalesque energy of the circus and the absurdity in writings by
authors like Mark Twain (1947 [2002, 113&ndash;114]), in inchoate gestures
of self-determination in choosing among the pseudo-individualized
options (Mariotti 2016), and in montage and other techniques of
discontinuity in avant-garde film (Hansen 2012; De la Fuente
2021).</p>

<h3 id="SocPsy">4.3 Social Psychology</h3>

<p>
As suggested already in the considerations of how the culture
industry&rsquo;s commodities are consumed, with the concept
&ldquo;dialectical anthropology&rdquo; (1947 [2002, xix]) Adorno (and
Horkheimer) incorporated into his social theory a historically dynamic
relationship between subjectivity, as studied by psychoanalysis, and
society, as studied by sociology (Dahmer 2012<strong>)</strong>.
Adorno&rsquo;s explorations of that relationship help explain some
aspects of his theory of the authoritarian personality and parts of
his account of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>
Almost from its inception the Institute pursued a &ldquo;marriage of
Marx and Freud&rdquo; (Jay 1996, 86&ndash;112; Whitebook 2004a), including a
practicing analyst, Erich Fromm, among its members. Adorno&rsquo;s
first, failed <em>Habilitationsschrift</em> sought to combine Kant and
Freud, arguing that the contents of the unconscious were at least
partly determined by social reality (Whitebook 2004b; Bloch 2019), a
claim that can also be found operating in several lines of argument in
<em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> (Sherratt 2002)<em>.</em>
Adorno&rsquo;s critique of Fromm&rsquo;s (and his followers&rsquo;)
&ldquo;revisionist&rdquo; psychoanalysis clarified his own position:
historicizing Freud&rsquo;s account of the drives, repression, the
Oedipal conflict, narcissicism, etc. showed that &ldquo;not only the
individual but the category of individuality is already a product of
society&rdquo; (1962 [2014, 330]; cf. 1955 [1967&ndash;68]); individual
intrapsychic developmental conflict is the dynamic site where
antagonistic society and antagonistic faculties of the psyche
interact.</p>

<p>
Adorno and Horkheimer argue that Freud&rsquo;s theory of subject
formation accorded with the earlier period of liberal capitalism, when
a bourgeois patriarchal family would elicit an Oedipal conflict in the
infant resulting in the splitting off of strong ego from id and the
installation of a superego, the psychoanalytic components required by
autonomous individuals in the bourgeois era. However, in the age of
monopoly capitalism&rsquo;s massive asymmetry in power, and the
integration of state and economy, the patriarch lost his unique
authority, replaced by representatives of the state but above all by
the culture industry. Under these changed social conditions the
individual, in the sense of an autonomous and mature
(<em>m&uuml;ndig</em>) person who makes reasoned decisions based on
&ldquo;a painful inner dialogue between conscience, self-preservation,
and drives&rdquo; (1947 [2002, 168]), tends to disappear. The new
conditions favor a &ldquo;new anthropological type&rdquo; (Adorno 1941
[2009]) that Adorno calls &ldquo;the authoritarian personality&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the manipulative character,&rdquo; characterized by
ego-weakness, reified consciousness, susceptibility to identifying
with autocratic leaders, a &ldquo;bourgeois coldness&rdquo; that
deadens mimetic responsiveness (Macdonald 2011), and a regression to
unsublimated drives. In sum, for Adorno the authoritarian personality
exhibits a profound &ldquo;inability to have experience&rdquo; in the
sense of consciously perceiving contradiction and dialectical
possibility (Adorno et al., 1950 [2019, 973]; cf. Fong
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Because the new anthropological type cannot reflectively work through
the contradictions and antagonisms of the socio-economic totality, its
unconscious anxiety and rage is directed via &ldquo;false
projection&rdquo; (&ldquo;the reverse of genuine mimesis,&rdquo; 1947
[2002, 154]) at those whose stereotyped <em>imago</em> remind it of
the renunciations and deceptions incurred in its adaption to the
totality. This is one of several kinds of explanation of anti-Semitism
in Adorno&rsquo;s writings; the image of the Jew suggests what has
partly escaped self-reification: &ldquo;happiness without power,
reward without work, a homeland without frontiers, religion without
myth&rdquo; (ibid., 164&ndash;5; Jay 1980; Rabinbach 2000). In several
empirical studies carried out in both the USA and pre- and post-war
Germany (Jacobs 2015; Rensmann 2017), the Institute developed
techniques for detecting the existence of this new anthropological
type, the most famous of these being the Berkeley study that resulted
in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em>: participants were asked
questions that indirectly revealed personality propensities according
to four metrics: the Anti-Semitism (AS) scale, the Ethnocentrism (E)
scale, the Political-Economic Conservativism (PEC) scale, and the
fascism (F) scale. Drawing from the analyses in the anti-Semitism
chapter of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment,</em> Adorno surmised that
qualities such as conventionalism, submissiveness, aggression,
aversion to subjectivity and imagination, superstition/stereotypy,
toughness, concern with others&rsquo; sexuality, etc., indicated a
high F-scale score. Several of these qualities, Adorno reasoned,
indicated a personality &ldquo;syndrome&rdquo; emerging in childhood,
hence deeper and prior to political thought and commitment, and
auguring a new social type (Marasco 2018). In a second, unpublished
part of his contribution to the <em>Authoritarian Personality</em>,
Adorno maintained that the personality type could only be fully
understood in the context of its societal conditions (Adorno et al.,
1950 [2019, xli-lxvi]).</p>

<p>
In a series of writings Adorno outlined the techniques and mechanisms
by which the authoritarian personality is psychologically manipulated
by fascist politics (e.g., 1943 [2000], 1951b [1991]). In 2019
Suhrkamp published Adorno&rsquo;s 1967 talk examining the similar
tactics used by the new right-wing party emerging at that time in
postwar Germany; the essay became a bestseller (1967c [2020]). <em>The
Authoritarian Personality</em> has remained a touchstone for social
psychology (e.g., Stone, Lederer, and Christie 1993), including
contemporary thinkers drawing on Adorno&rsquo;s work to understand the
current rise of popular authoritarianism (Brown, Gordon and Pensky
2018; Abromeit 2022; Weigel 2022).</p>

<p>
While Freud was less important to Frankfurt Critical Theorists working
immediately after Adorno (and Marcuse) (Whitebook 2004a), recently
Critical Theorists have returned to psychoanalysis in order to
theorize again the dynamic interplay between psyche and society.
Horkheimer and Adorno seemed to have bequeathed social psychology with
&ldquo;the paradox of authority&rdquo;: to resist authority seems to
require the formation of individuals with an autonomous, rational ego,
but this formation occurs by internalizing the domination and
authority of the father; Jessica Benjamin suggests that &ldquo;the
potential for emancipation be grounded in an intersubjective theory of
personality rather than an individual psychology of
internalization&rdquo; (1977, 42&ndash;43). Whitebook (1995)
reconceptualizes ego-formation through the concept of sublimation.
Fong (2016) considers a mostly unconscious source of
&ldquo;authority&rdquo; to fulfill a kind of autonomy. Allen (2021;
Allen and O&rsquo;Connor 2019) develops potentials from Freudian
transference theory, a Kleinian intersubjective, open-ended account of
ego-formation, and object relations theory.</p>

<h2 id="NegDia">5. Negative Dialectics</h2>

<p>
Several of Adorno&rsquo;s posthumously published postwar university
lecture courses and his Hegel book (1963a [1993]) record his thinking
toward his magnum opus, <em>Negative Dialectics</em>, which includes
his most sustained presentation of his metaphysical and
epistemological claims, as will be considered in this section. These
claims, in turn, consolidate and extend the historiographic and
social-theoretical arguments already canvassed. As Simon Jarvis
demonstrates, <em>Negative Dialectics</em> tries to formulate a
&ldquo;philosophical materialism&rdquo; that is historical and
critical but not dogmatic. Alternatively, one can describe the book as
a &ldquo;metacritique&rdquo; of idealist philosophy, especially of the
philosophy of Kant and Hegel (Jarvis 1998, 148&ndash;74;
O&rsquo;Connor 2004 and 2013, 54&ndash;109). Adorno says the book aims to
complete what he considered his lifelong task as a philosopher:
&ldquo;to use the strength of the subject to break through the
deception [<em>Trug</em>] of constitutive subjectivity&rdquo; (1966a
[1973, xx]); cf. 1969b [2005, 247]).</p>

<p>
This occurs in four stages. First, a long Introduction (1966a [1973,
1&ndash;57]) works out a concept of &ldquo;philosophical
experience&rdquo; that both challenges Kant&rsquo;s distinction
between &ldquo;phenomena&rdquo; and &ldquo;noumena&rdquo; and rejects
Hegel&rsquo;s construction of &ldquo;absolute spirit.&rdquo; Then Part
One (ibid., 59&ndash;131) distinguishes Adorno&rsquo;s project from
the &ldquo;fundamental ontology&rdquo; in Heidegger&rsquo;s <em>Being
and Time</em> (Gordon 2016, 120&ndash;158; Zuidervaart 2024, 55&ndash;76). Part
Two (ibid., 133&ndash;207) works out Adorno&rsquo;s alternative with
respect to the categories he reconfigures from German idealism. Part
Three (ibid., 209&ndash;408), composing nearly half the book,
elaborates philosophical &ldquo;models.&rdquo; These present negative
dialectics in action upon key concepts of moral philosophy
(Kant&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;), philosophy of history
(Hegel&rsquo;s &ldquo;world spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural
history&rdquo;), and metaphysics. Adorno says the final model, devoted
to metaphysical questions, &ldquo;tries by critical self-reflection to
give the Copernican revolution an axial turn&rdquo; (ibid., xx).
Alluding to Kant&rsquo;s self-proclaimed &ldquo;second Copernican
revolution,&rdquo; this description echoes Adorno&rsquo;s comment
about breaking through the deception of constitutive subjectivity.</p>

<p>
Like Hegel, Adorno criticizes Kant&rsquo;s distinction between
phenomena and noumena by arguing that the transcendental conditions of
experience can be neither so pure nor so separate from each other as
Kant seems to claim. As concepts, for example, the a priori categories
of the faculty of understanding (<em>Verstand</em>) would be
unintelligible if they were not already about something that is
nonconceptual. Conversely, the supposedly pure forms of space and time
cannot simply be nonconceptual intuitions. Not even a transcendental
philosopher would have access to them apart from concepts about them.
So too, what makes possible any genuine experience cannot simply be
the &ldquo;application&rdquo; of concepts to a priori structured
intuitions via the &ldquo;schematism&rdquo; of the imagination
(<em>Einbildungskraft</em>). Genuine experience is made possible by
that which exceeds the grasp of thought and sensibility. Adorno does
not call this excess the &ldquo;thing in itself,&rdquo; however, for
that would assume the Kantian framework he criticizes. Rather, he
calls it &ldquo;the nonidentical&rdquo; (<em>das
Nichtidentische</em>), and it has a plurality of operational meanings
(Thyen 2007; Silberbusch 2018).</p>

<p>
The concept of the nonidentical, in turn, marks the difference between
Adorno&rsquo;s materialism and Hegel&rsquo;s idealism. Although he
shares Hegel&rsquo;s emphasis on a speculative identity between
thought and being, between subject and object, and between reason and
reality, Adorno denies that this identity has been achieved in a
positive fashion. For the most part this identity has occurred
negatively instead. That is to say, human thought, in achieving
identity and unity, has imposed these upon objects, suppressing or
ignoring their differences and diversity. Such imposition is driven by
a societal formation whose exchange principle demands the equivalence
(exchange value, quantitative and abstract) of what is inherently
nonequivalent (use value, qualitative and concrete). Whereas
Hegel&rsquo;s speculative identity amounts to an identity between
identity and nonidentity, Adorno&rsquo;s amounts to a nonidentity
between identity and nonidentity (Sommer 2016; O&rsquo;Connor 2011;
Pinkard 2020). That is why Adorno calls for a &ldquo;negative
dialectic&rdquo; and why he rejects the affirmative character of
Hegel&rsquo;s dialectic (1966a [1973, 143&ndash;61]).</p>

<p>
Adorno does not reject the necessity of conceptual identification,
however, nor does his philosophy claim to have direct access to the
nonidentical. Under current societal conditions, thought can only have
access to the nonidentical via conceptual criticisms of false
identifications. Such criticisms must be &ldquo;determinate
negations,&rdquo; pointing up specific contradictions between what
thought claims and what it actually delivers. Through determinate
negation, those aspects of the object which thought misidentifies
receive an indirect, conceptual articulation.</p>

<p>
The motivation for Adorno&rsquo;s negative dialectic is not simply
conceptual, however, nor are its intellectual resources: his
epistemology is &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; in both regards. It is
motivated, he says, by undeniable human suffering&mdash;a fact of
unreason, if you will, to counter Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;fact of
reason.&rdquo; Suffering is the corporeal imprint of society and the
object upon human consciousness: &ldquo;The need to let suffering
speak is a condition of all truth. For suffering is objectivity that
weighs upon the subject &hellip; &rdquo; (ibid., 17&ndash;18). The
resources available to philosophy in this regard include the
&ldquo;expressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;mimetic&rdquo; dimensions of
language, which conflict with &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; (i.e., societally
sanctioned) syntax and semantics. In philosophy, this requires an
emphasis on &ldquo;presentation&rdquo; (<em>Darstellung</em>) in which
logical stringency and expressive flexibility interact (ibid.,
18&ndash;19, 52&ndash;53). Another resource lies in the
social-historical relationships among established concepts. By taking
such concepts out of their established patterns and rearranging them
in &ldquo;constellations&rdquo; around a specific subject matter,
philosophy can unlock some of the historical dynamic &ldquo;process
stored in the object,&rdquo; whose identity exceeds the
classifications imposed upon it (ibid., 52&ndash;53,
162&ndash;66).</p>

<p>
What unifies all of these desiderata, and what most clearly
distinguishes Adorno&rsquo;s materialist epistemology from
&ldquo;idealism,&rdquo; whether Kantian or Hegelian, is his emphasis
on the &ldquo;priority of the object&rdquo; (<em>Vorrang</em> <em>des
Objekts</em>, ibid., 183&ndash;97). Adorno regards as
&ldquo;idealist&rdquo; any philosophy that affirms an identity between
subject and object by assigning constitutive priority to the epistemic
subject. In emphasizing the priority of the object, Adorno repeatedly
makes three claims: first, that the epistemic subject is itself
objectively constituted by the society to which it belongs and without
which the subject could not exist; second, that no object can be fully
known according to the rules and procedures of identity thinking;
third, that the goal of thought itself, even when thought forgets its
goal under societally induced pressures to impose identity on objects,
is to honor them in their nonidentity, in their difference from what a
restricted rationality declares them to be. Against empiricism,
however, he argues that no object is simply &ldquo;given&rdquo;
either, both because it can be an object only in relation to a subject
and because objects are historical and have the potential to change.
However, such &ldquo;real possibilities&rdquo; (currently realizable
transformations) are obscured by ideological obstructions such
society&rsquo;s &ldquo;context of delusion&rdquo;
(<em>Verblendungszusammenhang)</em> and utopia conceived as merely
abstract wishful thinking within second nature as fate (Macdonald
2019a, 23&ndash;55).</p>

<p>
Under current conditions the only way for philosophy to give priority
to the object is dialectically, Adorno argues. He describes dialectics
as the attempt to recognize the nonidentity between thought and the
object while carrying out the project of conceptual identification.
Dialectics is &ldquo;the consistent consciousness of
nonidentity,&rdquo; and contradiction, its central category, is
&ldquo;the nonidentical under the aspect of identity.&rdquo; Thought
itself forces this emphasis on contradiction upon us, he says. To
think is to identify, and thought can achieve truth only by
identifying. So the semblance (<em>Schein</em>) of total identity
lives within thought itself, mingled with thought&rsquo;s truth
(<em>Wahrheit</em>). The only way to break through the semblance of
total identity is immanently, using the concept. Accordingly,
everything that is qualitatively different and that resists
conceptualization will show up as a contradiction. &ldquo;The
contradiction is the nonidentical under the aspect of [conceptual]
identity; the primacy of the principle of contradiction in dialectics
tests the heterogeneous according to unitary thought
[<em>Einheitsdenken</em>]. By colliding with its own boundary
[<em>Grenze</em>], unitary thought surpasses itself. Dialectics is the
consistent consciousness of nonidentity&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 5]).</p>

<p>
But thinking in contradictions is also forced upon philosophy by
society itself. Society is riven with fundamental antagonisms, which,
in accordance with the exchange principle, get covered up by identity
thinking. The only way to expose these antagonisms, and thereby to
point toward their possible resolution, is to think against
thought&mdash;in other words, to think in contradictions. In this way
&ldquo;contradiction&rdquo; cannot be ascribed neatly to either
thought or reality. Instead it is a &ldquo;category of
reflection&rdquo; (<em>Reflexionskategorie</em>), enabling a
thoughtful confrontation between concept (<em>Begriff</em>) and
subject matter or object (<em>Sache</em>): &ldquo;To proceed
dialectically means to think in contradictions, for the sake of the
contradiction already experienced in the object [<em>Sache</em>], and
against that contradiction. A contradiction in reality, [dialectics]
is a contradiction against reality&rdquo; (ibid., 144&ndash;45).</p>

<p>
The point of thinking in contradictions is not simply negative,
however. It has a fragile, transformative horizon, namely, a
rationality oriented toward an ideal &ldquo;noetic&rdquo; disclosure
of the non-identical corresponding to Benjamin&rsquo;s &ldquo;hope of
the name&rdquo; (Schn&auml;delbach 2007) and a society that would no
longer be riven with fundamental antagonisms, thinking that would be
rid of the compulsion to dominate through conceptual identification,
and the flourishing of particular objects in their particularity:
&ldquo;Were speculation concerning the state of reconciliation
allowed, then it would be impossible to conceive that state as either
the undifferentiated unity of subject and object or their hostile
antithesis: rather it would be the communication of what is
differentiated. &hellip; In its proper place, even epistemologically,
the relationship of subject and object would lie in a peace achieved
between human beings as well as between them and their Other. Peace is
the state of differentiation without domination, with the
differentiated participating in each other&rdquo; (1969b [2005, 247]).
Because Adorno is convinced that contemporary society has the
resources to alleviate the suffering it nevertheless perpetuates, his
negative dialectics has a utopian reach: &ldquo;In view of the
concrete possibility of utopia, dialectics is the ontology of the
false condition. A right condition would be freed from dialectics, no
more system than contradiction&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 11]). Such a
&ldquo;right condition&rdquo; would be one of reconciliation between
humans and nature, including the nature within human beings, and among
human beings themselves.</p>

<p>
This idea of reconciliation sustains Adorno&rsquo;s meditations on
metaphysics, the final part of <em>Negative Dialectics</em>.
Metaphysics, understood as thought about what most fundamentally and
generally is, reached its culmination as identity thinking in the
planned industrial extermination of Auschwitz, which &ldquo;confirmed
the philosopheme of pure identity as death&rdquo; (ibid., 362). While
Kant&rsquo;s critical method of transcendental idealism had consigned
the concepts of dogmatic metaphysics (God, immortal soul, freedom) to
the non-empirical, hence unknowable &ldquo;intelligible realm,&rdquo;
its &ldquo;constitutive subjectivity,&rdquo; composed of a priori
forms of intuition and categories of the understanding, constitutes a
&ldquo;Kantian block&rdquo; delimiting possible experience. Like
Heidegger, Adorno bristles against the priority of actuality over
possibility in the Western metaphysical tradition (Macdonald 2019a,
103&ndash;156), and so his aim is to rescue and legitimate the metaphysical
impulse that Kant acknowledged: the ability of mind to transcend in
thought that which is given: &ldquo;And this thinking beyond itself,
into <em>openness</em> &ndash; that, precisely, is metaphysics&rdquo;
(1965b [2000, 68]). This is one way to understand the role of
non-identity and the &ldquo;primacy of the object&rdquo; in negative
dialectics: as a structural placeholder for whatever leads thought
beyond its given forms of cognition: &ldquo;But the absolute, as it
hovers before metaphysics, would be the nonidentical that refuses to
emerge until the compulsion of identity has dissolved&rdquo; (1966a
[1973, 406]; Theunissen 2007). &ldquo;Metaphysical experience&rdquo;
is Adorno&rsquo;s name for the experience of mind&rsquo;s
self-transcendence beyond what is cognitively given: he relates
episodes of it in personal childhood reminiscences (e.g., 1966c
[2023]), in Proust&rsquo;s recollection of village names that seemed
to promise fulfillment but do not disappoint when they don&rsquo;t,
and in the distinct phenomenology of &ldquo;the situation of fruitless
waiting&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 372&ndash;76]; 1965b [2000, 143]). Metaphysical
experience is &ldquo;akin to the possibility of freedom&rdquo; (1966a
[1973, 396]), a possibility that, Adorno notes, &ldquo;is tending to
become paler and more desultory&rdquo; (1965b [2000, 143]), part of
his general lament of the &ldquo;withering of experience&rdquo; due to
reification and administered life (1951a [2005, 40]; Skirke 2012,
Gordon 2020).</p>

<p>
Adorno develops a complex account of how certain artworks &ndash; high
modernist, so-called &lsquo;autonomous&rsquo; artworks &ndash; can
also yield something resembling metaphysical experience: &ldquo;Even
at the highest peaks art is semblance; but art receives the semblance
&hellip; from that which has no semblance [<em>vom</em>
<em>Scheinlosen</em>] &hellip; No light falls on people and things in
which transcendence would not appear [<em>wiederscheine</em>].
Indelible in resistance to the fungible world of exchange is the
resistance of the eye that does not want the world&rsquo;s colors to
vanish. In semblance is promised that which has no semblance&rdquo;
(1966a [1973, 404&ndash;5, trans mod.]).</p>

<h2 id="AesThe">6. Aesthetic Theory</h2>

<p>
Philosophical and sociological studies of the arts and literature,
above all music (Paddison 1993), make up more than half of
Adorno&rsquo;s collected works (<em>Gesammelte</em>
<em>Schriften</em>). All of his most important social-theoretical
claims show up in these studies. Yet his &ldquo;aesthetic
writings&rdquo; are not simply &ldquo;applications&rdquo; or
&ldquo;test cases&rdquo; for theses developed in
&ldquo;nonaesthetic&rdquo; texts. Adorno rejects any such separation
of subject matter from methodology and all neat divisions of
philosophy into specialized subdisciplines. This is one reason why
academic specialists find his texts so challenging, not only
musicologists and literary critics but also epistemologists and
aestheticians. All of his writings contribute to a comprehensive and
interdisciplinary social philosophy (Zuidervaart 2007).</p>

<p>
First published the year after Adorno died, <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>,
his unfinished, second magnum opus<em>,</em> marks the incomplete
culmination of his remarkably rich body of aesthetic reflections. It
casts retrospective light on the entire corpus. It also comes closest
to the model of &ldquo;paratactical presentation&rdquo; (Hullot-Kentor
in Adorno 1970 [1997, xi-xxi]) that Adorno, inspired especially by
Walter Benjamin, found to be the most appropriate compositional
principle for his own &ldquo;atonal philosophy&rdquo; (Jameson 1990).
Relentlessly tracing concentric circles, <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>
carries out a dialectical double reconstruction. It reconstructs the
modern art movement from the perspective of philosophical aesthetics,
and it simultaneously reconstructs philosophical aesthetics,
especially that of Kant and Hegel, from the perspective of modern art.
From both sides Adorno tries to elicit the sociohistorical
significance of the art and philosophy discussed. One could argue that
Adorno&rsquo;s theory of modernism encompasses his philosophical
writings as a whole: aesthetics, epistemology, metaphysics, practical
and social philosophy, in their relationship to modernity (Hammer
2015; Foster 2016).</p>

<p>
Adorno&rsquo;s claims about art in general stem from his
reconstruction of the modern art movement. So a summary of his
philosophy of art sometimes needs to signal this by putting
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; in parentheses. The book begins and ends with
reflections on the social character of (modern) art. Two themes stand
out in these reflections. One is an updated Hegelian question whether
art can survive in a late capitalist world. The other is an updated
Marxian question whether art can contribute to the transformation of
this world. When addressing both questions, Adorno retains from Kant
the notion that art proper (&ldquo;fine art&rdquo; or &ldquo;beautiful
art&rdquo;&mdash;<em>sch&ouml;ne</em> <em>Kunst</em>&mdash;in
Kant&rsquo;s vocabulary) is characterized by formal autonomy. But
Adorno combines this Kantian emphasis on form with a Hegelian emphasis
on intellectual import (<em>geistiger</em> <em>Gehalt</em>) and a
Marxian emphasis on art&rsquo;s embeddedness in society as a whole.
The result is a complex account of the simultaneous necessity and
illusoriness of the artwork&rsquo;s autonomy. The artwork&rsquo;s
necessary and illusory autonomy, in turn, is the key to (modern)
art&rsquo;s social character, namely, to be &ldquo;the social
antithesis of society&rdquo; (1970 [1997, 8]; Gordon 2021).</p>

<p>
Adorno regards authentic works of (modern) art as social monads:
somehow representing society while causally isolated from it. The
unavoidable tensions within them express unavoidable conflicts within
the larger sociohistorical process from which they arise and to which
they belong. These tensions enter the artwork through the
artist&rsquo;s struggle with sociohistorically laden materials
(historically sedimented artistic techniques as well as empirical,
social elements) to create the artwork&rsquo;s individual form
(Nicholsen 1997; Geuss 1999; Robinson 2018; Pickford 2020). Adorno
sees all of these tensions and conflicts as
&ldquo;contradictions&rdquo; to be worked through and eventually to be
resolved. Their complete resolution, however, would require a
transformation in society as a whole, which, given his social theory,
does not seem imminent.</p>

<p>
As commentary and criticism, Adorno&rsquo;s aesthetic writings are
unparalleled in the subtlety and sophistication with which they trace
work-internal tensions and relate them to unavoidable sociohistorical
conflicts (for individual readings, see Witkin 1998; Plass 2006;
Hohendahl 2013, 103&ndash;151; Macdonald 2019b). One gets frequent glimpses
of this in <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>. For the most part, however, the
book proceeds at the level of metacritique&mdash;reflections on
categories employed in actual commentary and criticism, with a view to
their suitability for what artworks express and to their societal
implications. Typically he elaborates these categories as polarities
or dialectical pairs.</p>

<p>
One such polarity, and a central one in Adorno&rsquo;s theory of
artworks as social monads, occurs between the categories of import
(<em>Gehalt</em>) and function (<em>Funktion</em>). Adorno&rsquo;s
account of these categories distinguishes his sociology of art from
both hermeneutical and empirical approaches. A hermeneutical approach
would emphasize the artwork&rsquo;s inherent meaning or its cultural
significance and downplay the artwork&rsquo;s political or economic
functions. An empirical approach would investigate causal connections
between the artwork and various social factors without asking
hermeneutical questions about its meaning or significance. Adorno, by
contrast, argues that, both as categories and as phenomena, import and
function need to be understood in terms of each other. On the one
hand, an artwork&rsquo;s import and its functions in society can be
diametrically opposed. On the other hand, one cannot give a proper
account of an artwork&rsquo;s social functions if one does not raise
import-related questions about their significance. So too, an
artwork&rsquo;s import embodies the work&rsquo;s social functions and
has potential relevance for various social contexts. In general,
however, and in line with his critiques of positivism and
instrumentalized reason, Adorno gives priority to import, understood
as societally mediated and socially significant meaning. The social
functions emphasized in his own commentaries and criticisms are
primarily intellectual functions rather than straightforwardly
political or economic functions. This is consistent with a hyperbolic
version of the claim that (modern) art is society&rsquo;s social
antithesis: &ldquo;Insofar as a social function can be predicated for
artworks, it is their functionlessness&rdquo; (1970 [1997, 227]).</p>

<p>
The priority of import also informs Adorno&rsquo;s stance on art and
politics, which derives from debates with Luk&aacute;cs, Benjamin, and
Bertolt Brecht in the 1930s (Bloch, Luk&aacute;cs, Brecht et al. 1977;
Zuidervaart 1991, 28&ndash;43). Because of the shift in
capitalism&rsquo;s structure, and because of Adorno&rsquo;s own
complex emphasis on (modern) art&rsquo;s autonomy, he doubts both the
effectiveness and the legitimacy of tendentious, agitative, or
deliberately consciousness-raising art. Yet he does see politically
engaged art as a partial corrective to the bankrupt aestheticism of
much mainstream art. Under the conditions of late capitalism, the best
art, and politically the most effective, so thoroughly works out its
own internal contradictions that the hidden contradictions in society
can no longer be ignored. The plays of Samuel Beckett, to whom Adorno
had intended to dedicate <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, are emblematic in
that regard (Hammer 2015, 132&ndash;155).</p>

<p>
Arguably, the idea of &ldquo;truth content&rdquo;
(<em>Wahrheitsgehalt</em>) is the pivotal center around which all the
concentric circles of Adorno&rsquo;s aesthetics turn: &ldquo;All
aesthetic questions terminate in those of the truth content of
artworks&rdquo; but &ldquo;the truth content of an artwork requires
philosophy&rdquo; (1970 [1997, 335, 341; Zuidervaart 1991; Wellmer
1991, 1&ndash;35 ; Jarvis 1998, 90&ndash;123; Hammer 2015, 101&ndash;131;
Hulatt 2016b; Zuidervaart 2024, 101&ndash;128). For Adorno (as for Hegel),
truth is dialectical, disclosive, and non-propositionally
object-oriented, as when one speaks of a &ldquo;true&rdquo; friend.
The modernist artwork, however, does not fulfill a concept, rather it
has a &ldquo;enigmatic character&rdquo; because it is a processual
&ldquo;force field&rdquo; of tensions and tendencies of conceptual
polarities: sensuousness and meaning, spirit and constellation, form
and content, autonomy and heteronomy, mimesis and rational
construction, semblance and expression, etc.. The artwork has
social-historical content (its relationship to the societal context in
which it was made), which, along with the historical tradition of
artistic forms, techniques, genres, etc., is reflected and
&ldquo;sedimented&rdquo; in the form of the artwork, which in turn
indicates the truth content of the work as it unfolds in the ongoing
reception of the work. While classical aesthetics sees the balanced,
harmonious, organic unified form of aesthetic semblance as embodying
the work&rsquo;s truth content &ndash; the Hegelian &ldquo;sensuous
appearing of the Idea,&rdquo; the underlying essence that is
manifested in society&rsquo;s observable characteristics (for example
the ideal of social freedom in the bourgeois age) &ndash;, modern
art&rsquo;s truth content is negative and critical, the tendency
toward unified semblance (<em>Schein</em>) and meaning interrupted by
dissonance, heteronomy, abrupt and particular expression
(<em>Ausdruck</em>) eliciting mimetic responses such that Adorno
likens artwork and animality (Hofst&auml;tter and Steuer 2022).</p>

<p>
Philosophical analysis seeks to clarify conceptually the truth content
based on the social-historical content and aesthetic material
constituting the work&rsquo;s individual form that in its critical,
negative stance both reflects antagonistic late capitalist society and
holds onto art&rsquo;s &ldquo;promise of happiness&rdquo; (Finlayson
2012). For Adorno, then, philosophy and art, the experiences of a
philosophical text and an artwork, are closely intertwined (Hulatt
2016b, 105&ndash;134) . Philosophy &ldquo;must strive, by way of the
concept, to transcend the concept&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 15]; for
theological aspects of transcendence here, see Kaufmann 2000), that
is, to indicate by determinate negation that concept and the principle
of exchange fail to know the particular, the non-identical,
non-conceptual. Art, by way of sensuous intuition, as the
&ldquo;refuge&rdquo; of mimesis, can reach the particular, the
non-identical, but only by way of semblance, falsity: &ldquo;Art has
truth as the semblance of that which has no semblance&rdquo; (1970
[1997, 132, trans. mod.]). For Adorno philosophical,
&ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; experience on the one hand, from the side
of the concept, and aesthetic experience on the other, from the side
of intuition, grapple with the same problems of rationality,
epistemology, and metaphysics, the fateful legacy of the dialectic of
enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="EthPol">7. Ethics and Politics</h2>

<h3 id="Eth">7.1 Ethics</h3>

<p>
Although Adorno published no systematic treatise on moral philosophy,
he gave a lecture course in 1963 posthumously published as
<em>Problems of Moral Philosophy</em> (1963b [2000]), an earlier
lecture course on moral philosophy (1956/57) that has not yet been
published, and a 1964&ndash;65 lecture course on <em>History and
Freedom</em> (1964&ndash;65 [2006]) that partly deals with practical
philosophy; in some ways these texts are preparatory for arguments
made in <em>Negative Dialectics</em>. Moreover, his works, including
but not limited to <em>Minima Moralia</em>, are suffused with
reflections on normative judgments and even occasional prescriptions
such that many readers consider his corpus of writings to be ethical
through and through (Bernstein 2001, Seel 2004; to the contrary
Tassone 2005), as the attempt to fathom and respond to the industrial,
state-organized mass murder that Adorno consistently invokes with the
name &ldquo;Auschwitz&rdquo; and which he sees as the culmination of
the dialectic of enlightenment, reification and identity thinking that
reduces every individual to a &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; (1966a [1973,
362]).</p>

<p>
Adorno&rsquo;s negativism runs together logical negation and normative
rejection: what is &ldquo;false&rdquo; is what should not be
(Theunissen 2007). A preliminary here is the so-called
&ldquo;normative deficit&rdquo; or &ldquo;normativity problem&rdquo;
in Adorno&rsquo;s thought. This objection, first voiced by Habermas
(1987, 119), generalizes to the claim that the normative force in
Adorno&rsquo;s writing is undone by the absence of knowledge of or
appeal to a norm or standard which can justify his normative claims
(the apparent self-undermining of reason in <em>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</em> is an example). In the moral context, the strongest
view (Freyenhagen 2013) interprets Adorno claiming that society is
&ldquo;radically evil&rdquo; (&ldquo;substantive negativism&rdquo;)
and that in the current social-historical context one can attain no
knowledge of the good or right life (&ldquo;epistemic
negativism&rdquo;), but that knowledge of the bad alone suffices to
provide some normative force for social critique (&ldquo;metaethical
negativism&rdquo;). Hence, &ldquo;there is life no longer&rdquo;;
&ldquo;there is no right living in the false [life] [<em>Es gibt kein
richtiges Leben im falschen</em>]&rdquo;; &ldquo;The whole is the
false&rdquo; (1951a [2005, 15, 39, 50]); &ldquo;life itself is so
deformed and distorted that no one is able to live the good life in it
or to fulfill his destiny as a human being&rdquo; (1963b [2000, 167]).
In this situation, all one can do is strive to live &ldquo;less
wrongly&rdquo;: to know, immanently criticize, and resist the bad
(both Freyenhagen 2013 and Setiya 2023 work with verisons of
neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism here). More moderate
interpretations argue that Adorno identifies and explicates discrete
experiences of happiness and ethical goodness, for instance in
idealized childhood reminiscences, &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; and
aesthetic experiences that can serve as empirical sources of
normativity without, however, bearing justificatory force (Gordon
2024) or that Adorno&rsquo;s oblique writing is intended to evoke
without naming insights that can serve as a normative basis (Finlayson
2002), or that Adorno&rsquo;s contemplative phenomenological
experiences of objectivity themselves bear positive normative force
(Seel 2004; Richter 2019).</p>

<p>
For Adorno, under the conditions of late capitalism, moral philosophy
is first and foremost negative: &ldquo;On the question of whether
moral philosophy is possible today, the only thing I would be able to
say is that essentially it would consist in the attempt to make
conscious the critique of moral philosophy, the critique of its
options and an awareness of its antinomies&rdquo; (1963b [2000, 167]).
While Adorno considers a variety of established moral philosophies,
the primary target is Kant&rsquo;s as the philosophy of the bourgeois
age; this is in keeping with Adorno&rsquo;s method of
&ldquo;metacritique,&rdquo; which weaves philosophical criticisms of a
theory along with considerations of its social-historical conditions,
its &ldquo;experiential import&rdquo; (<em>Erfahrungsgehalt</em>). In
the model in <em>Negative Dialectics</em> entitled &ldquo;Freedom, or
the metacritique of practical reason,&rdquo; Adorno seeks to recast
Kantian autonomy (the capacity for self-determination via the rational
will in accordance with reason) in materialist terms. In the context
of the individual, he tends to conflate rational necessity with causal
necessity, of dubious philosophical cogency (Pippin 2005; J&uuml;tten
2010). He also supplants the transcendental account with a Freudian
developmental one (echoing the account in <em>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</em>), whereby Kant&rsquo;s picture of the rational
will, operating with pure reason and discounting somatic and
psychological incentives, amounts to &ldquo;the ego&rsquo;s rule over
the id&rdquo; through repression (1966a [1973, 273]). In the societal
context Adorno emphasizes that this picture of autonomy accords with
the needs of a burgeoning bourgeois society while demonstrating an
ideological character: the absolute separation of intelligible and
empirical, which underwrites the purely rational will, is belied by
the actual mediation of individual by society, e.g. by social and
economic roles which constitute real constraints on freedom (1966a
[1973, 152]); as late capitalist society becomes increasingly
functionally integrated, these constraints will increasingly
constrict: &ldquo;freedom and unfreedom are not primary phenomena, but
derivatives of a totality that at any given time exercises dominion
over the individual&rdquo; (1964&ndash;65 [2006, 207]).</p>

<p>
Adorno offers an alternative, materialist account of freedom implied
by his critique of rational autonomy as repression. He locates freedom
in the body, as the &ldquo;memory of an archaic impulse&rdquo; before
the consolidation into an ego (1966a [1973, 221]; 1964&ndash;65 [2006,
213]), as what cannot be attributed to rationalistic explanation, but
is a spontaneous &ldquo;addendum&rdquo; or &ldquo;supplement&rdquo;
(<em>das Hinzutretende</em>), prior to the strict division between
mental and somatic, hence &ldquo;intramental&rdquo; (1966a [1973,
228]) and that, in principle, could be reconciled with reason and a
subjectivity properly understood. This alternative conception of
freedom has implications for morality: &ldquo;A new categorical
imperative has been imposed by Hitler upon unfree mankind: to arrange
their thoughts and actions so that Auschwitz will not repeat itself,
so that nothing similar will happen. &hellip; the new imperative gives
us a bodily sensation of the moral addendum &ndash; bodily, because it
is now the practical abhorrence of the unbearable physical agony
&hellip; It is in the unvarnished materialistic motive only that
morality survives&rdquo; (1966a [1973, 365<strong>]</strong>).
&ldquo;The true primal phenomenon of moral behavior&rdquo;
&ldquo;occurs when the element of impulse joins with the element of
consciousness to bring about a spontaneous act&rdquo; (1964&ndash;65 [2006,
240]), for which Adorno adduces the example of one of the conspirators
in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. How exactly to understand this
model of practical action has been a topic of careful discussion, as
Adorno clearly acknowledges the necessary role of reason
(Schweppenh&auml;user 1993; Bernstein 2001; Freyenhagen 2013, 133&ndash;61;
Shuster 2014, 71&ndash;133). Less a systematic moral theory, Adorno&rsquo;s
call for the unconditional adherence to the moral impulse in part
operates in response to Kantian moral rationalism and Adorno&rsquo;s
critique of &ldquo;bourgeois coldness&rdquo; (1951a [2005, 26, 74];
1966a [1973, 263, 347]), the adaptive diminution of empathy and
affection that modern society requires, and offers interesting
prospects for considering this strain of his ethical thought as a
social-historically contextualized ethics of care (Ferrarese
2021).</p>

<p>
Fundamentally, Adorno&rsquo;s thoughts on morality and moral
philosophy remain critical, aporetic, and antinomian, for instance
between &ldquo;principle and practice,&rdquo; as between legal
procedural justice and impulsive vengeance in postwar Germany (1951a
[2005, 56]; 1966a [1973, 287]). Principles of rational morality, as in
Kant, are tailored to the self-reflection in which the modern
autonomous subject engages, which simultaneously separates insight
from action, exemplified, for Adorno, by Hamlet (1966a [1973, 228];
1963b [2000, 112&ndash;13]). The moral addendum, as perhaps a rudimentary
virtue ethics that immediately connects insight and action, is belied
by the obsolescence of virtue (1963b [2000, 98]) under the conditions
of modern society: value pluralism on the one hand, and interdependent
functional integration to such a degree on the other that an
agent&rsquo;s action can be thwarted or its moral worth inverted by
conditions outside their control (what Adorno calls the &ldquo;context
of guilt&rdquo;, <em>Schuldzusammenhang</em>) (Menke 2005). These
antinomies illustrate how social conditions undermine moral insight
and action, thus Adorno concludes his lecture course: &ldquo;&hellip;
anything that we can call morality today merges into the question of
the organization of the world. We might even say that the quest for
the good life is the quest for the right form of politics, if indeed
such a right form of politics lay within the realm of what can be
achieved today.&rdquo; (1963b [2000, 176]).</p>

<h3 id="Pol">7.2 Politics</h3>

<p>
The new categorical imperative encompasses political considerations;
according to Adorno, &ldquo;the misdeeds of Auschwitz were only
possible &hellip; in a political system in which freedom was
completely suppressed&rdquo; (1964&ndash;65 [2006, 202]; Tettlebaum 2005).
However, Adorno did not locate the primary danger at the level of the
nature of the state or political organization, claiming that the
conditions favoring a relapse continued unabated in postwar democratic
West Germany (1967b [2005 191&ndash;204]), and he was accused by early
critics and some of his own students of quietism, aestheticism, and
failing to theorize a normative political theory. For Adorno,
&ldquo;the political&rdquo; cannot be isolated from the larger,
integrated social totality, which permeates and affects every aspect
of quotidian life and has implications for how immanent critique can
be effectuated (Jaeggi 2005; on &ldquo;internal&rdquo; critique, which
holds norms fixed, vs. genuine &ldquo;immanent critique,&rdquo; which
can modify norms, cf. Jaeggi 2018). His relationship to Marxism and
liberalism is complex (Hammer 2006, 11&ndash;48): for instance, he rejects
the prospects of the formation of class consciousness in &ldquo;late
capitalism,&rdquo; and does not share liberalism&rsquo;s neutral
standpoint above rival doctrines of the good, nor its image of a
&lsquo;thin&rsquo; rational individual with contingent preferences
(Geuss 2005); indeed, <em>Minima Moralia</em> can be read as
critically registering the eclipse of liberalism (Norberg 2011).</p>

<p>
The question of politics arose most forcefully in the student protest
movement of the 1960s, some of whose organizers looked to Horkheimer
and Adorno for support (Kraushaar 1998). Adorno, in contrast to
Marcuse, demurred for political and philosophical reasons.
Politically, he judged the situation to be one in which direct
revolutionary action had scarce chance of success. Philosophically, in
a posthumously published essay on the historical relationship between
theory and praxis he distinguished between political action in the
service of reasonable ends and &ldquo;pseudo-activity&rdquo; that
insists on theory&rsquo;s subservience to concrete praxis as an
epicycle of the dialectic of enlightenment (1969c [2005, 259&ndash;278];
Berman 2002; Freyenhagen 2014). Scholars continue to elaborate the
relationship and prospects between Adorno&rsquo;s thought and
activities and an &ldquo;activist tradition&rdquo; in Critical Theory
(e.g., Holloway, Matamoros and Tischler 2009; Sebastian 2024 and
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Adorno persistently emphasized the political
implications of his theory <em>as</em> praxis, e.g. immanent, ideology
critique: &ldquo;[the culture industry] impedes the development
[<em>Bildung</em>] of autonomous, independent individuals who judge
and decide consciously for themselves. These, however, would be the
precondition for a democratic society which needs adults who have come
of age [<em>in M&uuml;ndigen</em>] in order to sustain itself and
develop&rdquo; (1967a [1991, 105]). Given then the diagnosis of
integrated social totality under stated administered monopoly
capitalism, reification and the new anthropological type, Adorno in
his time sees more hope in capacity building than in direct political
action. He invokes the German idealist notion of <em>Bildung</em>
(socially mediated self-formation, education) to castigate
contemporary educational and cultural institutions for purveying a
conformist &ldquo;Half-Bildung&rdquo;: conveying enough information
and relaxation to fulfill society&rsquo;s functions without inducing
any independent thought or personal growth (1959 [1993]). He also
invokes Kant&rsquo;s enlightenment notion of &ldquo;political
maturity&rdquo; (<em>M&uuml;ndigkeit</em>), the ability to think for
oneself, without the guidance of another, and itself a necessary
condition for autonomy in the sense of self-determination that,
however, can be cultivated even in situations of limited freedom
(O&rsquo;Connor 2013, 130&ndash;135) (against reified consciousness and
&ldquo;coldness&rdquo; Adorno also speaks of educating toward
&ldquo;unreduced experience&rdquo;). Cultivating and reinforcing such
capacities is &ldquo;politically necessary,&rdquo; for &ldquo;an
actual working democracy can only be conceived as a society of
politically mature people&rdquo; (1967d [1971, 107]).</p>

<p>
This political imperative underwrites Adorno&rsquo;s work as a public
intellectual. Having closely studied and worked with institutions of
the culture industry in the USA (Jenemann 2007), he identified and
emphasized moments within the products and technology where incipient
gestures of autonomy can be leveraged (Mariotti 2016). When he
returned to Germany, he pursued public enlightenment
(<em>Aufkl&auml;rungsarbeit</em>) through diverse media institutions
(magazine essays, radio talks and conversations, television
discussions, public lectures); this was the counterpoint to his
analyses of modernist artworks by which the &ldquo;truth
content&rdquo; of social antagonisms can be revealed, but which
requires precisely the classical Bildung of which most people are
cheated. Politically mature people will &ldquo;not cooperate&rdquo;
(<em>nicht</em> <em>mitmachen</em>) or at least be cognizant of the
material and ideological dynamics inducing their participation and
conformism. In this way Adorno&rsquo;s theoretical writings and
practical activities constitutes an &ldquo;ethics of resistance&rdquo;
(Hammer 2005; Pickford 2023).</p>

<p>
Scholars have in recent years turned to Adorno as one interlocutor in
discussions about the social ontology and politics of identity (see
the Adorno and Identity Seminars, Other Internet Resources).  Oberle
(2018) is an expansive historical study of Adorno&rsquo;s experiences
in exile and his theorizing about subjectivity under the category
&ldquo;negative identity&rdquo; and its social, economic and political
conditions. Okiji (2018) argues that Adorno&rsquo;s notoriously
dismissive analyses of jazz presuppose a subjectivity denied black
people; on the other hand, jazz performance exhibits qualities of the
avant-garde modernist music extolled by Adorno in a context of a
Marxian negativism shared by the Black radical tradition (Kelly 2024
finds problematic differences between Adorno and Black
aesthetics). Such studies seem to keep faith with Adorno: &ldquo;The
only thing that can perhaps be said is that the good life [<em>das
richtige Leben</em>] today would consist in resistance to the forms of
a wrong life [<em>eines</em> <em>falschen Lebens</em>] that have been
seen through and critically dissected by the most progressive
consciousness&rdquo; (1963b [2000, 167&ndash;8, trans mod.]).</p>

<p>
In 1969 shortly before his death and as Germany was being roiled by
student unrest, the news magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em> began its
interview with Adorno in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Spiegel: &ldquo;Professor Adorno, two weeks ago, the world still
seemed in order&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Adorno: &ldquo;Not to me.&rdquo; (1969d [2002, 14])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is perhaps no better summary than this of Adorno&rsquo;s view of
the state of the world, nor any better introduction to his
thought.</p>
