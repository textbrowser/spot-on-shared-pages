<h1>The Natural Law Tradition in Ethics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Sep 23, 2002; substantive revision Wed Apr 30, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
&lsquo;Natural law theory&rsquo; is a label that has been applied to
theories of ethics, theories of politics, theories of civil law, and
theories of religious morality. We will be concerned only with natural
law theories of ethics: while such views arguably have some
interesting implications for law, politics, and religious morality,
these implications will not be addressed here.</p>

<p>
This article has two central objectives. First, it aims to identify
the defining features of natural law moral theory. Second, it aims to
identify some of the main theoretical options that natural law
theorists face in formulating a precise view within the constraints
set by these defining features and some of the difficulties for each
of these options. It will not, however, attempt to recount the history
of the development of natural law thought. (For a very helpful
detailed history of natural law thought up to the beginning of the
modern period, see Crowe 1977. For a very helpful detailed history of
natural law thought in the modern period, see Haakonssen 1996. For an
article-length recap of the entire history of natural law thought, see
Haakonssen 1992.)</p>

<h2 id="KeyFeaNatLawThe">1. Key Features of Natural Law Theories</h2>

<p>
Even though we have already confined &lsquo;natural law theory&rsquo;
to its use as a term that marks off a certain class of ethical
theories, we still have a confusing variety of meanings to contend
with. Some writers use the term with such a broad meaning that any
moral theory that is a version of moral realism &mdash; that is, any
moral theory that holds that some positive moral claims are literally
true (for this conception of moral realism, see Sayre-McCord
1988)&mdash; counts as a natural law view. Some use it so narrowly
that no moral theory that is not grounded in a very specific form of
Aristotelian teleology could count as a natural law view. It might be
thought that there is nothing that can be done to begin a discussion
of natural law theory in ethics other than to stipulate a meaning for
&lsquo;natural law theory&rsquo; and to proceed from there. But there
is a better way of proceeding, one that takes as its starting point
the central role that the moral theorizing of Thomas Aquinas plays in
the natural law tradition. If any moral theory is a theory of natural
law, it is Aquinas&rsquo;s. (Every introductory ethics anthology that
includes material on natural law theory includes material by or about
Aquinas; every encyclopedia article on natural law thought refers to
Aquinas.) It would seem sensible, then, to take Aquinas&rsquo;s
natural law theory as the central case of a natural law position: of
theories that exhibit all of the key features of Aquinas&rsquo;s
natural law view we can say that they are clearly natural law
theories; of theories that exhibit few of them we can say that they
are clearly not natural law theories; and of theories that exhibit
many but not all of them we can say that they are in the neighborhood
of the natural law view but nonetheless must be viewed as at most
deviant cases of that position. There remain, no doubt, questions
about how we determine what are to count as the <em>key</em> features
of Aquinas&rsquo;s position. But we may take as the key features those
theses about natural law that structure his overall moral view and
which provide the basis for other theses about the natural law that he
affirms.</p>

<p>
For Aquinas, there are two key features of the natural law, features
the acknowledgment of which structures his discussion of the natural
law, among other sorts of law, at Questions 90&ndash;108 (the
&lsquo;Treatise on Law&rsquo;) of the Prima Secundae of the <em>Summa
Theologiae</em>. The first is that, when we focus on God&rsquo;s role
as the giver of the natural law, the natural law is just one aspect of
divine providence; and so the theory of natural law is from that
perspective just one part among others of the theory of divine
providence. The second is that, when we focus on the human&rsquo;s
role as recipient of the natural law, the natural law constitutes the
principles of practical rationality, those principles by which human
action is to be judged as reasonable or unreasonable; and so the
theory of natural law is from that perspective the preeminent part of
the theory of practical rationality.</p>

<h3 id="NatLawDivPro">1.1 Natural law and divine providence</h3>

<p>
While our main focus will be on the status of the natural law as
constituting the principles of practical rationality, we should
consider for a moment at least the importance within Aquinas&rsquo;s
view of the claim that the natural law is an aspect of divine
providence. The fundamental thesis affirmed here by Aquinas is that
the natural law is a participation in the eternal law (ST IaIIae 91,
2). The eternal law, for Aquinas, is that rational plan by which all
creation is ordered (ST IaIIae 91, 1); the natural law is the way that
the human being &ldquo;participates&rdquo; in the eternal law (ST
IaIIae 91, 2). While nonrational beings have a share in the eternal
law only by being determined by it &mdash; their action nonfreely
results from their determinate natures, natures the existence of which
results from God&rsquo;s will in accordance with God&rsquo;s eternal
plan &mdash; rational beings like us are able to grasp our share in
the eternal law and freely act on it (ST IaIIae 91, 2). It is this
feature of the natural law that justifies, on Aquinas&rsquo;s view,
our calling the natural law &lsquo;law.&rsquo; For law, as Aquinas
defines it (ST IaIIae 90, 4), is a rule of action put into place by
one who has care of the community; and as God has care of the entire
universe, God&rsquo;s choosing to bring into existence beings who can
act freely and in accordance with principles of reason is enough to
justify our thinking of those principles of reason as law in the
strictest sense. (See Brock 2020 for an extended argument for this
thesis.)</p>

<h3 id="NatLawPraRat">1.2 Natural law and practical rationality</h3>

<p>
When we focus on the recipient of the natural law, that is, us human
beings, the thesis of Aquinas&rsquo;s natural law theory that comes to
the fore is that the natural law constitutes the basic principles of
practical rationality for human beings, and has this status by nature
(ST IaIIae 94, 2). The notion that the natural law constitutes the
basic principles of practical rationality implies, for Aquinas, both
that the precepts of the natural law are universally binding by nature
(ST IaIIae 94, 4) and that the precepts of the natural law are
universally knowable by nature (ST IaIIae 94, 4; 94, 6).</p>

<p>
The precepts of the natural law are binding by nature: no beings could
share our human nature yet fail to be bound by the precepts of the
natural law. This is so because these precepts direct us toward the
good as such and various particular goods (ST IaIIae 94, 2). The good
and goods provide reasons for us rational beings to act, to pursue the
good and these particular goods. As <em>good</em> is what is
perfective of us given the natures that we have (ST Ia 5, 1), the good
and these various goods have their status as such naturally. It is
sufficient for certain things to be good that we have the natures that
we have; it is in virtue of our common human nature that the good for
us is what it is.</p>

<p>
The precepts of the natural law are also knowable by nature. All human
beings possess a basic knowledge of the principles of the natural law
(ST IaIIae 94, 4). This knowledge is exhibited in our intrinsic
directedness toward the various goods that the natural law enjoins us
to pursue, and we can make this implicit awareness explicit and
propositional through reflection on practice. Aquinas takes it that
there is a core of practical knowledge that all human beings have,
even if the implications of that knowledge can be hard to work out (ST
IaIIae 100, 1) or the efficacy of that knowledge can be thwarted by
strong emotion or evil dispositions (ST IaIIae 94, 6).</p>

<p>
If Aquinas&rsquo;s view is paradigmatic of the natural law position,
and these two theses &mdash; that from the God&rsquo;s-eye point of
view, it is law through its place in the scheme of divine providence,
and from the human&rsquo;s-eye point of view, it constitutes a set of
naturally binding and knowable precepts of practical reason &mdash;
are the basic features of the natural law as Aquinas understands it,
then it follows that paradigmatic natural law theory is incompatible
with several views in metaphysics and moral philosophy. On the side of
metaphysics, it is clear that the natural law view is incompatible
with atheism: one cannot have a theory of divine providence without a
divine being. It is also clear that the paradigmatic natural law view
rules out a deism on which there is a divine being but that divine
being has no interest in human matters. Nor can one be an agnostic
while affirming the paradigmatic natural law view: for agnosticism is
the refusal to commit either to God&rsquo;s existence or nonexistence,
whereas the paradigmatic natural law view involves a commitment to
God&rsquo;s existence. On the side of moral philosophy, it is clear
that the natural law view is incompatible with a nihilism about value,
that is, the rejection of the existence of values. It is also
incompatible with relativist and conventionalist views, on which the
status of value is entirely relative to one&rsquo;s community or
determined entirely by convention. It is also incompatible with a
wholesale skepticism about value, for the natural law view commits one
to holding that certain claims about the good are in fact knowable,
indeed, knowable by all.</p>

<h3 id="SubNatLawVie">1.3 The substance of the natural law view</h3>

<p>
The center of Aquinas&rsquo;s natural law view as described thus far
concerns what we might call the metaphysics of morals: its role in
divine providence and the universally authoritative character of its
norms. What, though, of the normative <em>content</em> of
Aquinas&rsquo;s natural law position? Is there anything distinctive
about the normative natural law position? Here it is difficult to say
much that is uncontroversial, but we can say a sufficient amount about
Aquinas&rsquo;s natural law theory to make clear that it is an
interesting alternative to utilitarian (and more generally
consequentialist) ethics, Kantian views, and standard Aristotelian
positions. (For magisterial treatments of Aquinas&rsquo;s natural law
ethic, see Rhonheimer 2000 and Brock 2020.)</p>

<p>
Aquinas says that the fundamental principle of the natural law is that
good is to be done and evil avoided (ST IaIIae 94, 2). This is, one
might say, a principle of intelligibility of action (cf. Grisez 1965):
only action that can be understood as conforming with this principle,
as carried out under the idea that good is to be sought and bad
avoided, can be understood as an intelligible action. But no one can
in acting simply pursue good &mdash; one has to pursue some particular
good. And Aquinas holds that we know immediately, by inclination, that
there are a variety of things that count as good and thus to be
pursued &mdash; life, procreation, knowledge, society, and reasonable
conduct (ST IaIIae 94, 2; 94, 3) are all mentioned by Aquinas (though
it is not clear whether the mentioned items are supposed to constitute
an exhaustive list).</p>

<p>
So on Aquinas&rsquo;s view it is the good that is fundamental: whether
an action, or type of action, is <em>right</em> is logically posterior
to whether that action brings about or realizes or is some
<em>good</em>. The good is, on Aquinas&rsquo;s view, prior to the
right. But on Aquinas&rsquo;s view we are, somehow, able to reason
from these principles about goods to guidelines about how these goods
are to be pursued. Aquinas&rsquo;s thoughts are along the following
lines: first, there are certain ways of acting in response to the
basic human goods that are defective as actions; and second, for an
act to be right, or reasonable, is for it to be in no way defective as
an action (ST IaIIae 18, 1).</p>

<p>
The important task, then, is to identify the ways in which an act can
be defective. Aquinas does not obviously identify some master
principle that one can use to determine whether an act is defective
(though for an attempt to identify such a master principle in
Aquinas&rsquo;s work see Finnis 1998, p. 126), though he does indicate
where to look &mdash; we are to look at the features that individuate
acts, such as their objects (ST IaIIae 18, 2), their ends (ST IaIIae
18, 3), their circumstances (ST IaIIae 18, 4), and so forth. An act
might be flawed through a mismatch of object and end &mdash; that is,
between the immediate aim of the action and its more distant point. If
one were, for example, to regulate one&rsquo;s pursuit of a greater
good in light of a lesser good &mdash; if, for example, one were to
seek friendship with God for the sake of mere bodily survival rather
than vice versa &mdash; that would count as an unreasonable act. An
act might be flawed through the circumstances: while one is bound to
profess one&rsquo;s belief in God, there are certain circumstances in
which it is inappropriate to do so (ST IIaIIae 3, 2). An act might be
flawed merely through its intention: to direct oneself against a good
&mdash; as in murder (ST IIaIIae 64, 6), and lying (ST IIaIIae 110,
3), and blasphemy (ST IIaIIae 13, 2) &mdash; is always to act in an
unfitting way. Aquinas has no illusions that we will be able to state
principles of conduct that exhaustively determine right conduct, as if
for every situation in which there is a correct choice to be made
there will be a rule that covers the situation. He allows for the
Aristotelian insight that the particulars of the situation always
outstrip one&rsquo;s rules, so that one will always need the moral and
intellectual virtues in order to act well (Commentary on NE, II, 2,
259). But he denies that this means that there are no principles of
right conduct that hold everywhere and always, and some even
absolutely. On Aquinas&rsquo;s view, killing of the innocent is always
wrong, as is lying, adultery, sodomy, and blasphemy; and that they are
always wrong is a matter of natural law. (These are only examples, not
an exhaustive list of absolutely forbidden actions.)</p>

<p>
Part of the interest of Aquinas&rsquo;s substantive natural law ethic
lies in its not falling into the neat contemporary categories for
moral theories. His natural law view understands principles of right
to be grounded in principles of good; on this Aquinas sides with
utilitarians, and consequentialists generally, against Kantians. But
Aquinas would deny that the principles of the right enjoin us to
maximize the good &mdash; while he allows that considerations of the
greater good have a role in practical reasoning, action can be
irremediably flawed merely through (e.g.) badness of intention, flawed
such that no good consequences that flow from the action would be
sufficient to justify it &mdash; and in this Aquinas sides with the
Kantians against the utilitarians and consequentialists of other
stripes. And while Aquinas is in some ways Aristotelian, and
recognizes that virtue will always be required in order to hit the
mark in a situation of choice, he rejects the view commonly ascribed
to Aristotle (for doubts that it is Aristotle&rsquo;s view, see Irwin
2000) that there are no universally true general principles of right.
The natural law view rejects wholesale particularism.</p>

<h3 id="ParNonNatLawThe">1.4 Paradigmatic and nonparadigmatic natural law theories</h3>

<p>
To summarize: the paradigmatic natural law view holds that (1) the
natural law is given by God; (2) it is naturally authoritative over
all human beings; and (3) it is naturally knowable by all human
beings. Further, it holds that (4) the good is prior to the right,
that (5) right action is action that responds nondefectively to the
good, that (6) there are a variety of ways in which action can be
defective with respect to the good, and that (7) some of these ways
can be captured and formulated as general rules.</p>

<p>
Aquinas was not the only historically important paradigmatic natural
law theorist. Thomas Hobbes, for example, was also a paradigmatic
natural law theorist. He held that the laws of nature are divine law
(<em>Leviathan</em>, xv, &para;41), that all humans are bound by them
(<em>Leviathan</em>, xv, &para;&para;36), and that it is easy to know
at least the basics of the natural law (<em>Leviathan</em>, xv,
&para;35). He held that the fundamental good is self-preservation
(<em>Leviathan</em>, xiii, &para;14), and that the laws of nature
direct the way to this good (Leviathan, xiv, &para;3). He offered a
catalog of laws of nature that constitute the &ldquo;true moral
philosophy&rdquo; (<em>Leviathan</em>, xv, &para;40). There are also a
number of contemporary writers that affirm the paradigmatic view.
These writers, not surprisingly, trace their views to Aquinas as the
major influence, though they do not claim to reproduce his views in
detail. (See, for example, Grisez 1983, Finnis 1980, MacIntyre 1999,
and Murphy 2001.)</p>

<p>
There are a number of writers, both historical and contemporary, whose
views are easily called natural law views, through sharing all but one
or two of the features of Aquinas&rsquo;s paradigmatic position.
Recently there have been nontheistic writers in the natural law
tradition, who deny (1): see, for example, the work of Michael Moore
(1982, 1996), Philippa Foot (2001), and Michael Thompson (2008). There
were a number of post-Thomistic writers in the medieval and modern
periods who in some way denied (2), the natural authority of the
natural law, holding that while the <em>content</em> of the natural
law is fixed either wholly or in part by human nature, its
<em>preceptive power</em> could only come from an additional divine
command: the views of John Duns Scotus, Francisco Suarez, and John
Locke fit this mold. Arguably the Stoics were natural law thinkers,
but they seem to deny (4), holding the right to be prior to the good
(see Striker 1986). Some contemporary theological ethicists called
&lsquo;proportionalists&rsquo; (e.g. Hallett 1995) have taken up the
natural law view with a consequentialist twist, denying (6). (For a
discussion of the relationship between proportionalism and natural law
theory see Kaczor 2002.) And while some see Aristotle as being the
source of the natural law tradition, some have argued that his central
appeal to the insight of the person of practical wisdom as setting the
final standard for right action precludes the possibility of the sort
of general rules that would (at least in a theistic context) make
Aristotle&rsquo;s ethics a natural law position. There is of course no
clear answer to the question of when a view ceases to be a natural law
theory, though a nonparadigmatic one, and becomes no natural law
theory at all.</p>

<h2 id="TheOptForNatLawThe">2. Theoretical Options for Natural Law Theorists</h2>

<p>
Even within the constraints set by the theses that constitute the
paradigmatic natural law position, there are a number of variations
possible in the view. Here we will consider several issues that must
be addressed by every particular natural law view, and some
difficulties that arise for possible responses to these issues.</p>

<h3 id="NatGoo">2.1 Natural goodness</h3>

<p>
It is essential to the natural law position that there be some things
that are universally and naturally good. But how is universal, natural
goodness possible? Given the variability of human tastes and desires,
how could there be such universal goods?</p>

<p>
Natural law theorists have at least three answers available to them.
The first answer is Hobbesian, and proceeds on the basis of a
subjectivist theory of the good. On subjectivist theories of the good,
what makes it true that something is good is that it is desired, or
liked, or in some way is the object of one&rsquo;s pro-attitudes, or
would be the object of one&rsquo;s pro-attitudes in some suitable
conditions. One might think that to affirm a subjectivist theory of
the good is to reject natural law theory, given the immense variation
in human desire. But this is not so. For one might hold that human
beings&rsquo; common nature, their similarity in physiological
constitution, makes them such as to have some desires in common, and
these desires may be so central to human aims and purposes that we can
build important and correct precepts of rationality around them. This
is in fact what Hobbes claims. For while on the Hobbesian view what is
good is what is desired, Hobbes thinks that humans are similarly
constructed so that for each human (when he or she is properly
biologically functioning) his or her central aim is the avoidance of
violent death. Thus Hobbes is able to build his entire natural law
theory around a single good, the good of self-preservation, which is
so important to human life that exceptionlessly binding precepts can
be formulated with reference to its achievement.</p>

<p>
The second answer is Aristotelian. The idea here is to reject a
subjectivism about the good, holding that what makes it true that
something is good is not that it stands in some relation to desire but
rather that it is somehow <em>perfective</em> or <em>completing</em>
of a being, where what is perfective or completing of a being depends
on that being&rsquo;s nature. So what is good for an oak is what is
completing or perfective of the oak, and this depends on the kind of
thing that an oak is by nature; and what is good for a dog is what is
completing or perfective of the dog, and this depends on the kind of
thing that a dog is by nature; and what is good for a human depends on
what is completing or perfective of a human, and this depends on the
kind of thing a human is by nature. So the fact of variability of
desire is not on its own enough to cast doubt on the natural law
universal goods thesis: as the good is not defined fundamentally by
reference to desire, the fact of variation in desire is not enough to
raise questions about universal goods. This is the view affirmed by
Aquinas, and the majority of adherents to the natural law
tradition.</p>

<p>
The third answer is Platonic. Like the Aristotelian view, it rejects a
subjectivism about the good. But it does not hold that the good is to
be understood in terms of human nature. The role of human nature is
not to define or set the good, but merely to define what the
possibilities of human achievement are. So one might think that some
things &mdash; knowledge, beauty, etc. &mdash; are just good in
themselves, apart from any reference to human desire or perfection,
but hold that the pursuit of these are only part of the natural law
insofar as they fall within the ambit of human practical possibility.
This view of the good is not much defended &mdash; in part because of
the scathing criticism offered of Plato&rsquo;s view by Aristotle in
the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> (NE I, 6) &mdash; but it was affirmed
by Iris Murdoch (1970), and forms part of the natural law view
defended by Michael Moore (1982).</p>

<p>
None of these answers is without difficulties. While there are
contemporary defenders of Hobbesian moral theories (see Gauthier
1986), there is no one who is on record defending Hobbes&rsquo;s
interesting combination of a thoroughgoing subjectivism about the good
along with an account of a dominant substantive good around which the
moral rules are formulated. The basic reason for this just seems to be
that Hobbes&rsquo;s arguments that the human desire for
self-preservation is such an entirely dominant desire are implausible,
and there do not seem to be any better arguments available. The
Platonic version of the view has struck many as both too
metaphysically ornate to be defensible, on one hand, and as not
fitting very well with a conception of ethics grounded in nature, on
the other. While the Aristotelian version of the view has also been
charged with some of the metaphysical excesses that the Platonist view
allegedly countenances, most contemporary natural law theory is
Aristotelian in its orientation, holding that there is still good
reason to hold to an understanding of flourishing in nature and that
none of the advances of modern science has called this part of the
Aristotelian view into question. (For defenses of such Aristotelian
accounts of the good, see Foot 2001, Thompson 1995, and Thompson
2004.)</p>

<h3 id="KnoBasGoo">2.2 Knowledge of the basic goods</h3>

<p>
Another central question that the natural law tradition has wrestled
with concerns our knowledge of the basic goods. How can we come to
know these fundamental goods as such?</p>

<p>
Return to Aquinas&rsquo;s paradigmatic natural law position. His
account of our knowledge of the fundamental goods has been understood
in different ways (Murphy 2001, ch. 1). Some have understood Aquinas
as affirming a theory of our knowledge of the fundamental precepts of
the natural law that we can label &lsquo;derivationism.&rsquo; The
idea here is that we can derive from a metaphysical study of human
nature and its potentialities and actualizations the conclusion that
certain things are good for human beings, and thus that the primary
precepts of the natural law bid us to pursue these things (cf. Lisska
1996). One can imagine a Hobbesian version of this view as well. One
might say that by a careful observation of actual human desire,
buttressed by an appropriate theory of the human being&rsquo;s
desire-forming mechanisms, one can see that there are certain things
that would be necessarily desired by biologically sound human beings,
and thus that the human good includes these items. (Hobbes in fact
produces such arguments at [EL], I, 7.) While a natural law theorist
might downplay the importance of derivationist knowledge of the
natural law, it is hard to see how a consistent natural law theorist
could <em>entirely</em> reject the possibility of such knowledge,
given the view that we can provide a substantial account of how the
human good is grounded in nature: for to show that the human good is
grounded in nature is to show that human nature explains why certain
things are goods, and it is hard to see how one could affirm that
claim while entirely rejecting the possibility of derivationist
knowledge of the human good (see Murphy 2001, pp. 16&ndash;17). Some
have thought, echoing criticisms of natural law theory by those
entirely hostile to it, that derivationist theories of practical
knowledge fall prey to &lsquo;Hume&rsquo;s Law,&rsquo; that it is
impossible to derive an &lsquo;ought&rsquo; from an &lsquo;is,&rsquo;
that is, any normative truth from any set of nonnormative truths. The
most that this can show, though, is that the natural law theorist
needs an account of those bridge truths that enable us to move between
claims about human nature and claims about human goods.</p>

<p>
It must be conceded, however, that it is a strain for the natural law
theorist to hold that derivationist knowledge of the human good is the
only such knowledge possible. For it is part of the paradigm natural
law view that the basic principles of the natural law are known by
all, and the sort of arguments that would need to be made in order to
produce derivationist knowledge of the human good are certainly not
had (or even have-able) by all. (Jensen (2015) and Brock (2020) have,
however, offered defenses of derivationist accounts that aim to take
such worries into account.) Another way that Aquinas&rsquo;s account
of knowledge of the fundamental goods has been understood &mdash; and
it is an understanding better able to come to grips with the
widespread knowledge of fundamental goods &mdash; can be labeled
&lsquo;inclinationism.&rsquo; On this view, one&rsquo;s explicit grasp
of the fundamental goods follows upon but is not derived from
one&rsquo;s persistent directedness toward the pursuit of certain
ends, which directedness involves an implicit grasp of these items as
good. So human beings exhibit a tendency to pursue life, and
knowledge, and friendship, and so forth; and reflection on this
tendency occasions an immediate grasp of the truth that life, and
knowledge, and friendship, and so forth are goods. The affirmation of
the claims &lsquo;life is good,&rsquo; &lsquo;knowledge is
good,&rsquo; &lsquo;friendship is good,&rsquo; etc. makes intelligible
the persistent pursuit of these ends by rational beings like us.</p>

<p>
While inclinationism and derivationism are distinct methods, they are
by no means exclusive: one can hold that knowledge of fundamental
goods is possible in both ways. Indeed, it may well be that one way of
knowing can supplement and correct the other. There may be some goods
that are easier to recognize when taking the speculative point of
view, the point of view of the observer of human nature and its
potentialities, and some that are easier to recognize when taking the
practical point of view, the point of view of the actively engaged in
human life. Indeed, by connecting nature and the human good so
tightly, the natural law view requires that an account of the good
reconcile these points of view.</p>

<p>
There are, of course, reasons to be worried about both of these ways
of knowing basic goods &mdash; worries that go beyond general
skeptical doubts about how we could know any normative truths at all.
Derivationists have to explain how we come to know what counts as an
actualization of a human potency, and have to explain how we connect
these via bridge principles with human goods. Inclinationists have
their own troubles. In particular, they need to deal with the fact
that, even if they are not in the business of deriving goods from
inclinations or identifying the goods precisely with what we tend to
pursue, they take as their starting point human directedness. And it
has been rightly noted that human directedness is not always a lovely
thing. Power and prestige seem to be a matter of human directedness
&mdash; at least as much so as, say, aesthetic enjoyment and
speculative knowledge &mdash; but they do not make it to the natural
law theorist&rsquo;s catalog of goods (though they do appear to be
part of the good in Aristotle&rsquo;s picture; cf. the discussion in
Hare 2001, p. 14). While these difficulties persist for inclinationist
and derivationist accounts of knowledge of the basic goods (though for
skepticism about the force of this objection, see Brock 2020, pp.
162&ndash;165), they may well be eased if one affirms both accounts: one
might be able to use inclinationist knowledge to provide some basis
for bridge principles between knowledge of human nature and knowledge
of human goods, and one might be able to use derivationist knowledge
to modify, in a non-ad-hoc way, the objectionable elements of the
account that one might be bound to give if proceeding on an
inclinationist basis alone. (Reconciling the inclinationist and
derivationist approaches is a theme in Murphy 2001 and Wall 2010.)</p>

<p>
The dialectic between inclinationist and derivationist accounts of
knowledge of the first principles of the natural law is central to
natural law epistemology, but there are other accounts of knowledge of
the natural law that focus on its social dimension. Alasdair MacIntyre
has argued, for example, that the first precepts of the natural law
are to be understood as those that make possible communal inquiry into
the nature of the good: both the positive and the negative precepts
are enabling rules, norms that enable humans to engage in common
pursuit of knowledge of what is valuable. The norms of the natural law
preclude our acting toward other potential partners in inquiry in way
that would undermine the possibility of common pursuit of the good
(MacIntyre 1994, 183&ndash;184). To come to know the primary precepts
of the natural law, then, is a matter of coming to know what sorts of
social relationships make possible common pursuit of common goods.</p>

<p>
A distinct sort of social emphasis on knowledge of the natural law
asks why we should think of knowledge of the natural law as arising
exclusively or even predominantly either from one&rsquo;s own
immediate rational insight into what is implicitly grasped or from some
sort of derivation from the fact that one&rsquo;s own inclinations of
the will have certain determinate objects. One might hold that we have
excellent reason to believe that knowledge of the natural law unfolds
historically. Jean Porter, for example, argues that by close attention
to the various sorts of social structure exhibited cross-culturally,
we can extract the necessary &ldquo;starting points&rdquo; (Porter
2005, p. 132) to begin assessing various proposed norms of action. And
Jonathan Crowe emphasizes knowledge of the natural law as the outcome
of the attempt to interpret human practices, and will be an
historically-extended process that will be necessarily an unfinished
task (Crowe 2019, pp. 6&ndash;7; there is also discussion of interpretation
of social practices as a means to knowing the natural law in Murphy
2007 and Brock 2020, p. 163).</p>

<h3 id="CatBasGoo">2.3 The catalog of basic goods</h3>

<p>
A developed natural law theory includes within it a catalog of the
fundamental goods, the basic values upon which the principles of right
are founded. Suppose that we follow at least the inclinationist line,
taking it to be faithful to the natural law idea that knowledge of the
basic goods is widely distributed. Our task then is to provide an
explicit account of those goods implicit knowledge of which is
manifested in human inclination toward certain ends. What are the
goods affirmation of which makes intelligible these inclinations?</p>

<p>
It is clear from this way of putting the question that even if natural
law theorists are right that this implicit knowledge is widely
distributed, it would be easy for natural law theorists to disagree in
their catalogs of basic goods. For the task here is that of
formulating propositionally, and in as illuminating a way as possible,
what items need be affirmed as intrinsically good in order to make
sense out of our inclinations. And there are, unsurprisingly,
disagreements in catalogs of basic goods. The goods that Aquinas
mentions in his account include life, procreation, social life,
knowledge, and rational conduct. Grisez 1983 includes
self-integration, practical reasonableness, authenticity, justice and
friendship, religion, life and health, knowledge of truth,
appreciation of beauty, and playful activities (pp. 121&ndash;122).
Finnis 1980 includes life, knowledge, aesthetic appreciation, play,
friendship, practical reasonableness, and religion (pp. 86&ndash;90).
Chappell 1995 includes friendship, aesthetic value, pleasure and the
avoidance of pain, physical and mental health and harmony, reason,
rationality, and reasonableness, truth and the knowledge of it, the
natural world, people, fairness, and achievements (p. 43). Finnis 1996
affirms a list much like Grisez 1983, but includes in it &ldquo;the
marital good&rdquo; (p. 5). Murphy 2001 includes life, knowledge,
aesthetic experience, excellence in work and play, excellence in
agency, inner peace, friendship and community, religion, and happiness
(p. 96). Gomez-Lobo 2002 includes life, the family, friendship, work
and play, experience of beauty, theoretical knowledge, and integrity
(pp. 10&ndash;23). Crowe (2019) includes life, health, pleasure,
friendship, play, appreciation, understanding, meaning, and
reasonableness (p. 35).</p>

<p>
Aside from the inevitable differences in lists of goods produced by
natural law theorists, there are also more focused debates about the
inclusion of particular alleged goods within the natural law
theorists&rsquo; lists. Note, for example, that of the lists above,
only Chappell&rsquo;s includes pleasure and the absence of pain.
Whatever else we say here, it seems that common sense is initially on
Chappell&rsquo;s side: what seems more obvious than that pleasure and
the avoidance of pain are basic reasons for action? The reasons for
rejecting pleasure and the absence of pain from the list of goods are
various: some writers argue, following Aristotle, that pleasure is not
a good in abstraction from the activity in which pleasure is taken;
some that the absence of pain is not a completion or a fulfillment of
human nature, and thus cannot be among the basic goods; some that the
avoidance of pain is simply an instance of some other basic good, such
as inner peace. What this debate illustrates is the extent to which
the formulation of a catalog of goods is not a straightforward matter.
Everyone agrees that one who avoids touching a hot stove in part to
avoid the awful pain has <em>some reason</em> to avoid touching the
stove. The difficulty is to bring together our various sources of
knowledge about the good to formulate an account that explains well
precisely why it is that such an act is reasonable. These sorts of
debates reappear with respect to goods like life (is life
intrinsically or instrumentally good? is merely being alive
intrinsically good, or is life only intrinsically good when one is
enjoying a certain level of vitality?), religion (is harmony with God
really a human good? is it merely a kind of friendship? does its
status as a good depend on whether there is a being such as God?), and
what Finnis and Grisez now call the &lsquo;marital good&rsquo; (is the
good of marriage simply an amalgam of various other goods, as
friendship, procreation, rational agency, or is it really a distinct,
analytically separable value?). Thus Eche&ntilde;ique denies that life
can be a basic good in the way that natural law theorists typically
take it to be (Eche&ntilde;ique 2016); Cuneo has rejected religion as
a basic good (Cuneo 2005, pp. 116&ndash;118); and Macedo has argued
against the marital good (Macedo 1995).</p>

<h3 id="GooRig">2.4 From the good to the right</h3>

<p>
Suppose that we were to have in hand satisfactory accounts of natural
goodness and our knowledge of it, along with a rationally defensible
account of the basic goods that are the fundamental reasons for
action. All that we would have so far is the natural law
theorist&rsquo;s account of what we might call minimally rational
action &mdash; action that seeks to realize some good. What we would
not have yet is a full account of right action. For we are frequently
in situations in which there are various different courses of action
that we might pursue, each of which promises to realize some good; are
there no guidelines to which we might appeal in order to show some of
these choices superior to others? After all, some of even the most
obviously morally wrong actions can be seen to promise <em>some</em>
good &mdash; a robber might kill in order to get the money he needs to
pursue genuine goods &mdash; and the natural law theorist wants to be
able to say why these obviously wrong actions are wrong. As we have
seen, the paradigmatic natural law view holds that there are some
general rules of right that govern our pursuit of the various goods,
and that these rules of right exclude those actions that are in some
way <em>defective</em> responses to the various basic goods. How,
though, are we to determine what counts as a defective response to the
goods?</p>

<p>
There are at least three possibilities. One might appeal to a master
rule of right that can be used to generate further rules; call this
the <em>master rule</em> approach. One might appeal to a
methodological principle by which particular rules can be generated;
call this the <em>method</em> approach. Or one might appeal to some
standard for distinguishing correct and incorrect moral rules that is
not understandable as a method; call this (for reasons we shall see
shortly) the <em>virtue</em> approach.</p>

<p>
On the master rule approach, the task of the natural law theorist is
to identify some master rule which bears on the basic goods and,
perhaps in conjunction with further factual premises, is able to
produce a stock of general rules about what sorts of responses to the
basic goods are or are not reasonable. While it is far from clear
whether there was a single way that Aquinas proceeded in establishing
moral norms from the primary precepts of the natural law in the
<em>Summa Theologiae</em>, John Finnis has argued (Finnis 1998, p.
126) that Aquinas employed this master rule approach: on his view,
Aquinas held that this master rule is the rule of universal love, that
one should love one&rsquo;s neighbor as oneself. This rule bids us to
respond to the good lovingly wherever it can be realized, and from it
we can see that certain ways of responding to the good are ruled out
as essentially unloving. Grisez clearly employs this approach: he
writes that the first principle of morality is that &ldquo;In
voluntarily acting for human goods and avoiding what is opposed to
them, one ought to choose and otherwise will those and only those
possibilities whose willing is compatible with a will toward integral
human fulfillment&rdquo; (Grisez 1983, p. 184). This first principle,
Grisez says, contains implicitly within it various &ldquo;modes of
responsibility&rdquo; from which particular moral rules can be
derived.</p>

<p>
The central difficulty with this employment of the master rule
approach is that of explaining how we are to grasp this first
principle of morality as correct. What is the relationship between our
knowledge of the basic goods and our knowledge of the master rule?
When Grisez defends his master rule, he writes that its status is due
to a certain function that a first principle of morality must perform:
&ldquo;It must provide the basis for guiding choices toward overall
human fulfillment. As a single principle, it will give unity and
direction to a morally good life. At the same time, it must not
exclude ways of living which might contribute to a complete human
community&rdquo; (Grisez 1983, p. 184). But this presupposes an awful
lot: why should we assume in advance that a proper response to the
basic goods must be one that is oriented toward a &ldquo;complete
human community&rdquo;?</p>

<p>
On the method approach, by contrast, there is no need for a master
principle that will serve as the basis for deriving some particular
moral rules. The idea here is the natural law theorist needs not a
master rule from which to derive other rules but a test for
distinguishing correct moral rules from incorrect ones. We know from
our earlier consideration of the paradigmatic natural law view that
the test for distinguishing correct moral rules from incorrect ones
must be something like the following: if a moral rule rules out
certain choices as defective that are in fact defective, and rules out
no choices as defective that are not in fact defective, then it is a
correct moral rule. What would distinguish different employments of
the method approach is their accounts of what features of a choice we
appeal to in order to determine whether it is defective. The knowledge
that we have to go on here is our knowledge of the basic goods. If a
certain choice presupposes something false about the basic goods, then
it responds defectively to them. So a moral rule can be justified by
showing that it rules out only choices that presuppose something false
about the basic goods.</p>

<p>
This is very abstract. Here is an example of an employment of this
approach. While Finnis later comes to affirm Grisez&rsquo;s master
rule approach, in his 1980 work he defends various principles of
practical reasonableness without adverting to a master rule. He
argues, for example, that it is always wrong to intend the destruction
of an instance of a basic good (Finnis 1980, pp. 118&ndash;123). (So,
no lying, for lying is an intentional attack on knowledge; no murder,
for murder is an intentional attack on life, and so forth.) Why is it
always wrong to do so? It would be unreasonable simply to try to
destroy an instance of a basic good, for no further purpose: for that
would treat an instance of a basic good as something that it is not
&mdash; that is, as valueless. And it would be wrong to destroy an
instance of a basic good for the sake of bringing about some other
instance of a basic good: for that would make sense only if the good
brought about were more valuable than the good destroyed, but on
Finnis&rsquo;s view all distinct instances of basic goods are
incommensurable &mdash; none is of more, less, or equal value with any
other. So the rule forbidding intentional destruction of an instance
of a basic good is justified because it rules out only choices that
presuppose something false about the nature of the basic goods. (For a
working out of the method approach, see Murphy 2001, ch. 5.)</p>

<p>
The method approach presupposes less of substance about morality than
the master rule approach presupposes. But it requires us to draw upon
an interesting and rich knowledge of the features of the basic goods.
Whether this information is available is a matter for debate. But the
method approach has the advantage of firmly rooting natural law
arguments for moral principles in the goods the pursuit of which those
moral principles are supposed to regulate.</p>

<p>
Neither the master rule nor the method approach implies that the
natural law theorist must hold that all right action can be captured
in general rules. The natural law view is only that there are some
such rules. It is consistent with the natural law position that there
are a number of choice situations in which there is a right answer,
yet in which that right answer is not dictated by any natural law rule
or set of rules, but rather is grasped only by a virtuous, practically
wise person. It is, however, open to the natural law theorist to use
this appeal to the judgment of the practically wise person more
widely, holding that the general rules concerning the appropriate
response to the goods cannot be properly determined by any master rule
or philosophical method, but can be determined only by appeal to the
insight of the person of practical wisdom. If it really is wrong in
all cases to tell lies, as Aquinas and Grisez and Finnis have argued,
our grasp of this moral truth is dependent on our possessing, or our
being able to recognize the possessor of, practical wisdom. If such a
person never tells lies, because she or he just sees that to tell lies
would be to respond defectively to the good, then that lying is always
wrong is a rule of the natural law.</p>

<p>
It may be true that by the virtue approach we can learn of some
general rules of the natural law. What is more interesting is whether
a defender of the virtue approach would be right to dismiss the claims
of the master rule or method approaches. (For, after all, one might be
able to learn that lying is wrong <em>either</em> through moral
argument or through the perceptive insight of practical wisdom.) And
it does not seem that the defender of the master rule or method
approach should be particularly concerned to discredit the virtue
approach. For if defenders of the master rule or method approach
recognize the existence of a capacity of judgment like practical
wisdom, then it would be strange to allow that it can be correctly
exercised on a number of particular occasions while denying that we
might learn of general rules from observing patterns of its exercise
on various occasions.</p>

<p>
One challenge to these various natural law attempts to explain the
right in terms of the good denies that the natural law theorist can
provide adequate explanations of the range of norms of right conduct
for which moral theories ought to be able to provide explanations.
That is, one might allow for the sake of argument the natural law
theorist&rsquo;s identification of some range of human goods, while
denying that he or she can identify, and justify in natural law terms,
adequately concrete modes of appropriate response to those goods. This
challenge cannot be profitably addressed here; what would be required
would be a close examination of the merits of particular natural law
explanations of particular moral norms (a task taken up in, for
example, Grisez 1993). One might also look to recent attempts to apply
the natural law view to pressing contemporary moral problems &mdash;
those of business ethics (Velazquez and Brady 1997 and Gonzalez 2015),
research ethics (Tollefsen 2008), economic justice (Chartier 2009),
environmental ethics (Davison 2009), the ethics of suicide and
euthanasia (Paterson 2015), population ethics (Delaney 2016), the
ethics of warfare (Black 2024), and sexual ethics (Besong 2025), for
example &mdash; as tests of the fruitfulness of that position.</p>

<h3 id="NatLawMorObl">2.5 Natural Law and Moral Obligation</h3>

<p>
An open question for natural law theories of ethics, pressed even by
those who are sympathetic to the view that there are natural human
goods and that the character of those goods can fix certain responses
to them as defective, is whether natural law theory has the resources
to explain why failure to adhere to the precepts of the natural law
constitutes a violation of a <em>moral obligation</em>. It is entirely
to be expected that those who are unsympathetic to the idea of natural
goods or to the notion that the character of those goods is sufficient
to mark out certain responses to them as defective would think that a
natural law account of moral obligation is doomed to be
unsatisfactory. Much more interesting are those challenges from those
who are at least broadly sympathetic with the natural law point of
view as characterized thus far. To get at the various ways natural law
theory&rsquo;s ability to capture moral obligation has been
challenged, it is helpful to first notice the difference between two
ways of conceptualizing moral obligation. </p>

<p>
One way of conceptualizing moral obligation ties it to a failure of
practical reason, or to a salient class of failures of practical
reason. Take as a paradigmatic example of this type of account Joseph
Raz&rsquo;s 1977 view. Raz takes as the fundamental normative unit a
reason for action, and he thus characterizes moral obligations in
terms of reasons. If it is morally obligatory to f, it is not
sufficient merely that there be some reason to f; it must also be true
that there are reasons for not acting on certain reasons for not
f-ing. The further presence of such &ldquo;exclusionary&rdquo;
reasons, holds Raz, is what accounts for the peremptory character of
moral obligation, on which certain options are not simply outweighed
but are nevertheless rendered ineligible for the agent. </p>

<p>
On Raz&rsquo;s view, though, it is plain that the presence of reasons
thus structured is not sufficient for the obligatoriness of f-ing.
While these reasons may support the notion that the action in question
is in some way nonoptional, in order for this to count as obligation
it cannot be that the reasons in question arise simply from enabling
the agent to pursue the agent&rsquo;s own goals. And for distinctively
<em>moral</em> obligation, we would almost certainly have to add an
additional layer to specify what is moral about it &mdash; that the
values that support such reasons be of specific kinds (e.g.
well-being), say, or that the reasons be endorsable from a certain
point of view (e.g. an impartial standpoint). </p>

<p>
This is a <em>rational-response</em> view of moral obligation, on
which a failure to adhere to one&rsquo;s moral obligations is
constituted by failure to respond appropriately to reasons of a
certain kind. Contrast this position with an
<em>appropriate-holding</em> view of moral obligation, on which it is
constitutive of moral obligation that it is something for which one
can be appropriately held accountable. One can try to specify this
view further by identifying particular sorts of such holdings that are
appropriate, by identifying the parties who may or must do the
relevant holding, and by identifying the sort of appropriateness that
is at stake. This is the sort of view defended by Stephen Darwall
(2006; see also Wallace 1996). While he accepts as part of the truth
about moral obligation a view in the vicinity of Raz&rsquo;s &mdash;
that for something to be morally obligatory, it must be something that
one has decisive reasons to do (2006, p. 98) &mdash; he thinks that a
rationally mandatory response, even to values that are unquestionably
of moral relevance, does not count as a moral <em>obligation</em>
unless there are parties who have standing to demand of us that we act
in those ways. </p>

<p>
If the rational-response view of the nature of moral obligation were
correct, then it would seem that one could grant the success of a
natural law account of goods and of the defectiveness of certain sorts
of response to them while denying the power of a natural law view to
provide an account of moral obligation only if one could find a basis
for denying that the rational necessities in play were distinctively
moral. So one might hold that, for example, a Hobbesian account of
natural law is incapable of generating an account of moral obligation,
because the normative force of the precepts of the natural law derives
simply from the prospects of securing one&rsquo;s own desired
self-preservation. But a more standard natural law account, like
Aquinas&rsquo;s, would not be open to objection on that score and thus
it is much less plausible that one could criticize
Aquinas&rsquo;s account for being incapable of explaining moral
obligations in the rational-response sense if one concedes the basics
of his theory of practical rationality. (And this is how Aquinas
characterizes the obligatoriness of actions, in terms of their being
necessary with respect to the order of reason; see ST IIaIIae 58,
3.)</p>

<p>
What about moral obligatoriness as conceived by the
appropriate-holding view? If we take as given that those precepts
direct us toward rationally necessary responses to morally relevant
goods, do natural law theorists have the resources to hold that the
precepts of the natural law constitute moral obligations for us?</p>

<p>
The standard way within natural law theory to attempt to capture the
appropriate-holding sense of moral obligation is by conceiving of God
as the party who appropriately holds us to compliance with it. While
it seems a mistake to think that we must think that such holdings
always involve sanctions, it has been a common view in the history of
philosophy to associate the obligation of law somehow with the
presence or appropriateness of sanctions for noncompliance. While it
is unclear both whether this is a plausible theory of the nature of
legal obligation and whether Aquinas takes sanctions to be essential
to law, it is plain that Aquinas does argue that the natural law is
backed by divine sanctions. The most immediate sanction, which is
&ldquo;immediate and connatural&rdquo; (Brock 2020, 212), is the
remorse of conscience (Aquinas; ST IaIIae 87, 1). On Brock&rsquo;s
view, this counts as a way in which we are appropriately held to
compliance with the natural law, even those of us who do not
conceptualize the precepts of practical reason as God-given. For on
Aquinas&rsquo;s view, God has made us such that we experience this as
a characteristic result of failure to adhere to the natural law; that
it is thus experienced is the product of divine legislative activity,
and God has standing to attach such consequences to our failures to
adhere to that God-given law. It is true that if we do not think of
the natural law as given by God, we will not be able to see the norms
of the natural law as obligatory in this specific sense. But those
norms will still <em>be</em> obligatory in that we are in fact bound
by the natural law principles and held to account by someone who
appropriately holds us to them.</p>

<p>
It is, however, a perfectly sensible question why it is that God has
standing to hold us accountable for violations of the natural law.
Such standing looks like a certain sort of practical authority, and it
is far from trivial to give a satisfactory account of why God
naturally counts as authoritative in the relevant sense (Murphy 2002).
Perhaps such standing would be easier to establish if it consisted
simply in the absence of certain normative requirements against
calling others to account for certain ways of acting badly. But if it
is conceived positively, as a necessary and natural normative
relationship between God and humans, those who defend this view need
to provide an account of why such a relationship holds.</p>

<p>
Put that worry to the side. Even if God is granted to naturally have
such standing, this way of satisfying the appropriate-holding account
would be taken by the most prominent defenders of such a view as not
meeting its terms in the way that those terms were intended.
&lsquo;Holding accountable,&rsquo; on these writers&rsquo; views, is
not satisfied merely by someone who has standing to hold others
accountable for failure to comply actually imposing some consequences
for failure to comply. Rather, their view is that holding accountable
is an essentially social (Darwall 2006 calls it
&ldquo;second-personal&rdquo;) phenomenon. It is only insofar as we
stand in <em>social</em> relationships to others who are entitled to
hold us accountable for our failure to adhere to some standard that
that standard can count as morally obligatory (Adams 1999, ch. 10).
This is one basis for thinking that the precepts of the natural law
could not constitute moral obligations for human beings unless we are
in a social relationship with God in which God commands, or otherwise
commits to hold us to, adherence to the principles of the natural law.
This point has been wielded by divine command theorists like Adams
(1999) and Evans (2013), who hold that the natural law account&rsquo;s
focus on fitting response to natural goodness does not provide them
with adequate materials to account for the phenomenon of moral
obligation.</p>

<p>
Suppose that a natural law theorist were persuaded by this sort of
essentially social understanding of what counts as appropriate
holding. Would it follow that the theological voluntarist has any
advantage over the natural law theorist in accounting for moral
obligation? It is not obvious why this would be. To whatever extent
some theological voluntarist holds that God stands in a social
relationship to us humans, and thus is related to us in a way such
that we can be appropriately held accountable by God for our failures
to adhere to divine commands, the natural law theorist can feel free
to make use of that appeal to God&rsquo;s standing in that social
relationship to us to explain why we are appropriately held
accountable for our failure to adhere to the precepts of the natural
law, thus explaining why those precepts count as morally obligatory
for us. If the theological voluntarists think that appeal to the
social character of obligation gives them a leg up in accounting for
moral obligation over the natural law theorists, they are mistaken. On
the contrary: such divine command theorists face the task of
explaining why they want to insist, on the basis of the claim that God
must serve as the supreme <em>enforcer</em> of moral norms, that
God&rsquo;s commanding activity is the <em>source</em> of those moral
norms.</p>

<p>
While thinking of God as the party who appropriately holds us to
compliance with the natural law is standard within natural law theory,
it is not a forced move, and it even comes with the following
theoretical cost. Suppose that one thinks that the norms of the
natural law are naturally morally obligatory in the
appropriate-holding sense, but that God&rsquo;s being in a social
(rather than a merely causal) relationship with us humans is not a
matter of necessity. Natural law theorists would then have a puzzle:
how can we by nature be morally obligated by the natural law when it
is a matter of divine grace, contingently bestowed, that God is in a
social relationship with us? But the following way out is salient:
maybe it is not God, but one&rsquo;s <em>fellow human beings</em> (or
some class of such human beings specially related to one, e.g.
parents, friends, etc.), who are entitled to hold one to adherence to
the natural law, and it is their standing to hold us to the natural
law that constitutes its moral obligatoriness for us. This would be to
follow the path of contemporary Kantians like Darwall (2006, 102), who
hold that it is in virtue of our being appropriately held to account
by members of the moral community that moral norms count as obligatory
for us. And since it is by nature that we humans live in community, it
can likewise be true that the precepts of the natural law &mdash; or
some salient subset of them &mdash; count as moral obligations for us.
</p>

<p>
Natural law theorists who take this route would still be left with the
question of how to explain why and to what extent one&rsquo;s fellow
humans have standing to hold one to compliance to the natural law.
Given their bedrock commitment to the view that the natural law is
rooted in our distinctively human nature, it is unlikely that they
would be interested in appealing to neo-Kantian accounts by which
rational beings as such have that standing with respect to each other.
Perhaps natural law theorists would have to appeal simply to the way
that the principles of the natural law direct them to help others to
act well (Murphy 2011, pp. 169&ndash;172), though this seems thinner than
the sort of standing to which Darwall and other Kantians have
appealed. Or perhaps natural law theorists will have to innovate by
affirming basic sorts of standing, in addition to basic goods, in
order to account for the naturalness of moral obligation.</p>
