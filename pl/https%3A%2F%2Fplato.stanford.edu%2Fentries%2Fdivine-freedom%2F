<p>
The topic of divine freedom concerns the extent to which a divine
being &mdash; in particular, the supreme divine being, God &mdash; can
be free. There are, of course, many different conceptions of who or
what God is. This entry will focus on one enormously important and
influential model, according to which God is a personal being who
exists necessarily, who is essentially omnipotent, omniscient,
perfectly good, and perfectly rational, and who is the creator and
sustainer of all that contingently
 exists.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 (For more discussion of these attributes, see the entries on
 <a href="../omnipotence/">omnipotence</a>,
 <a href="../omniscience/">omniscience</a>,
 <a href="../perfect-goodness/">perfect goodness</a>,
 and
 <a href="../creation-conservation/">creation and conservation</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
God, so construed, is widely held to have a will, and God&rsquo;s will
is widely thought to be free &ndash; although divine freedom is
understood in various ways, to be set out below in section
 1.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Why hold that God has free will? Kittle (2016) offers four typical
reasons: (1) God is a personal being, and free will is required for
personhood; (2) freedom is a perfection that one should expect the
supreme being to have; (3) freedom is required for moral
responsibility, and God is morally
 responsible;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 and (4) the freedom of God&rsquo;s purposes and actions gives them
greater significance than they would otherwise
 have.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 The idea that God is free can also be motivated by (5) appeal to
sacred texts and religious traditions that depict God this
 way.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This entry will not attempt to summarize everything that has been said
throughout the history of philosophy or theology about the freedom of
God; it will instead focus on the contemporary discussion of divine
freedom among analytic philosophers. Three goals can be discerned in
this literature. One is expository: philosophers develop and defend
interpretations of what canonical figures have held about this
 issue.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 A second goal might be termed &lsquo;constructive-critical&rsquo;:
philosophers devise models of God&rsquo;s freedom, while criticizing
rival views &ndash; whether or not these are found in, or inspired by,
canonical sources. The third goal is to discover connections between
models of divine freedom and the question of whether God exists. This
entry will not discuss the first. It will focus primarily on the
second goal, by setting out the central models of divine freedom found
in the literature (sections 1.1&ndash;1.4), and the contexts to which
these models have been applied (sections 2.1&ndash;2.7). The third
goal will be discussed along the way, and the relevant threads will be
drawn together and extended in section 2.7.</p>

<p>
Here are two important issues pertaining to divine freedom that will
not be discussed further in this entry. The first is whether God is
free with respect to creating the things that contingently exist. Some
thinkers have understood creation to be an <em>involuntary</em>
consequence of God&rsquo;s nature, whereas others have thought that
God <em>freely</em> chooses to
 create.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 The second is a particular issue for Christians. Traditional
Christian doctrine holds that God is tri-personal, and that Christ,
the second person of the Trinity, has two natures: one fully human,
the other fully divine. Unsurprisingly, then, questions about whether
Christ is free (and if so, in what fashion) have long been discussed.
For a survey of some recent work on this topic, see Pawl and Timpe
(2016).</p>

<p>
Two preliminary points are worth mentioning before continuing. First,
while it has been argued that human freedom is only
<em>analogically</em> similar to divine freedom, the contemporary
discussion generally takes for granted that there is univocity between
divine freedom and human freedom, meaning that the same concepts are
in play, and are to be understood in the same
 way.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Second, granting this univocity, it remains an open question whether,
if human beings and God are free, they have the same sort of
 freedom.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<h2 id="ConForDivFre">1. Conditions for Divine Freedom</h2>

<p>
Whether human beings have free will, and if so, what this amounts to,
are perennial questions throughout the history of philosophy, and they
continue to receive enormous attention. (See the entry on
 <a href="../freewill/">free will</a>.)
 The contemporary literature on human freedom is much larger than the
contemporary literature on divine freedom, and &ndash; unsurprisingly
&ndash; the former influences the latter, with respect to how issues
are framed, which positions are articulated, and how these positions
are
 defended.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Theories of human free will are traditionally divided into two groups:
<em>compatibilist</em> and <em>incompatibilist</em>. The former hold
that human free will is compatible with determinism; the latter hold
that the two are incompatible. (For more on this, see the entries on
 <a href="../compatibilism/">compatibilism</a>,
 on
 <a href="../incompatibilism-theories/">incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will</a>,
 and on
 <a href="../incompatibilism-arguments/">arguments for incompatibilism</a>.)
 Of course, neither view entails that human beings actually have free
will, and both views are consistent with this claim. But the
traditional way of understanding this division is not helpful for
categorizing theories of divine free will. That&rsquo;s because the
(causal) determinism at issue holds that the future is fully
determined by the past states of the universe, together with the laws
of nature &ndash; but theists generally hold that God created and has
complete control over the universe and the laws of nature, so God
cannot be <em>determined</em> by them (e.g., Swinburne 1977,
128&ndash;9; Leftow 2023, 170). As we will see, however, while
God&rsquo;s actions cannot be determined in this way, some
philosophers have argued that God&rsquo;s actions are nevertheless
determined by his <em>nature</em> &ndash; in particular, his perfect
goodness or his perfect rationality. Compatibilists about divine
freedom hold that God can nevertheless be free even if God&rsquo;s
actions are determined in this way, whereas incompatibilists deny
this.</p>

<p>
<em>Libertarianism</em> is one of the traditional theories of human
free will. It is the conjunction of incompatibilism with the claim
that human beings are free. (While this is a minority view among
philosophers in general, it is a much more popular view among
philosophers of religion in
 particular.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>)
 A libertarian about <em>divine</em> freedom, then, holds that God is
free, and that God&rsquo;s actions are not determined in any relevant
way. Libertarianism is often taken to involve an additional commitment
to the Principle of Alternative Possibilities, one generic version of
which holds that a person acts freely only if, at the time of action,
she could have chosen otherwise. (That said, there are libertarians
who reject this requirement, and compatibilists who endorse it. For
more on this, see the entries on
 <a href="../freewill/">free will</a>
 and on
 <a href="../alternative-possibilities/">moral responsibility and the principle of alternative possibilities</a>.)
 The remainder of this section discusses several putative conditions
for divine freedom, beginning with this one. Defenders of these
conditions typically hold that they are necessary for divine freedom
&ndash; and sometimes hold that they are sufficient, too.</p>

<h3 id="AltPosTimAct">1.1 Alternate Possibilities At the Time of Action</h3>

<p>
An ordinary, intuitive conception of freedom &ndash; which has a long
historical pedigree &ndash; requires that alternate possibilities be
available to the agent at the time of action. Thomas Flint expresses
this idea as follows: &ldquo;an agent is truly free with respect to an
action only if the situation in which he is placed is logically and
causally compatible with both his performing and his not performing
the action&rdquo; (1983, 255). Theodore Guleserian expresses this idea
in terms of the power to do otherwise than one does at the time of
action, and holds it to be a necessary truth: &ldquo;Necessarily, for
every [agent] <em>x</em>, [act] <em>A</em>, and
[circumstance] <em>C</em>, if <em>x</em> is free with respect to doing
<em>A</em> in <em>C</em> then <em>x</em> has the power to refrain from
doing <em>A</em>&rdquo; (1985, 221). Others who endorse this
requirement on divine freedom include William Rowe (2004), Simon
Kittle (2016, 2022), and Frances Howard-Snyder (2017).</p>

<p>
Beyond its intuitive appeal and historical pedigree, there is another
reason why some hold that divine freedom requires alternate
possibilities. Arguments from evil attempt to show that God does not
exist by appeal to some fact(s) about evil. (See the entry on the
 <a href="../evil/">problem of evil</a>.)
 An important family of responses invokes human free will. In simple
terms, these hold that human beings freely bring about evil, and that
this evil does not count against God&rsquo;s existence, since it is a
very great good for human beings to have freedom &ndash; even if they
misuse it. These responses take human freedom to require alternate
possibilities: after all, if human free will were compatible with
determinism, God could bring it about that human beings never bring
about evil, <em>and</em> that they do so <em>freely</em>. Given the
enormous value accorded to human free will of this sort in these
responses, it&rsquo;s natural for their defenders to hold that God
also has this sort of freedom (Flint 1984; Morriston 1985, 2000;
Howard-Snyder
 2017.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Of course, as noted above, some thinkers deny that divine freedom and
human freedom must be understood in the same way.</p>

<p>
All that said, the claim that divine freedom always requires alternate
possibilities at the time of action is a minority view in the
contemporary literature. It is rejected in various ways by, for
example, Talbott 1988; Lehe 1986; Senor 2008; McCann 2013;
Timpe 2014; Director 2017; Murphy 2017; Daeley 2021, and
Couenhouven 2012, 2016, and 2023. One important motivation for
denying this invokes perfect goodness. Since God is a necessary being,
and is essentially perfectly good, it seems that there can be no
alternate possibilities in which God&rsquo;s actions fail to be
perfectly good. If this is correct, then those who wish to maintain
that God <em>freely</em> acts with perfect goodness must hold that
divine freedom does not always require alternate
 possibilities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
One final issue is worth mentioning. Some authors follow Alvin
Plantinga in distinguishing <em>morally significant freedom</em> from
freedom. According to Plantinga, &ldquo;&hellip; an action is
<em>morally significant</em>, for a given person at a given time, if
it would be wrong for him to perform the action but right to refrain,
or vice versa&rdquo; (1974, 166). Given this distinction, and given
the model of freedom that requires alternate possibilities, to hold
that God cannot fail to act in a morally perfect fashion is to say
that God lacks <em>morally significant</em> freedom &ndash; but this
is compatible with God having morally <em>insignificant</em>
freedom.</p>

<h3 id="AbsExtCon">1.2 Absence of External Constraints</h3>

<p>
It seems obvious that external constraints can be freedom-undermining:
for example, a prisoner&rsquo;s lack of freedom to leave is due to
constraints imposed by the prison, the cell, the shackles, etc.
Likewise, it is widely held that a necessary condition for divine
freedom is the absence of external constraints on God&rsquo;s will
(e.g., Swinburne 1977; Lehe 1986; Morris and Menzel 1986; Helm 1988;
Wierenga 2002; Senor 2008; Talbott 2009; Oppy 2014; Timpe 2014;
Couenhouven 2023, and Leftow 2023). Robert Lehe expresses this idea as
follows: &ldquo;A more profound sense of freedom than the liberty to
do or refrain from performing an action is freedom in the sense of
being determined by nothing and subject to no authority beyond
oneself&rdquo; (1986, 322). Thomas Morris and Christopher Menzel
similarly state that God is &ldquo;neither constrained nor compelled
by anything existing independent of God and his causally efficacious
power&rdquo; (1986, 357). Brian Leftow (2023) offers the most detailed
defence of this condition. He identifies several candidates for what
might count as external contraints, and argues that none of these
truly bind God. These are: logic and mathematics, the laws of nature,
the past, and the free choices of creatures (and their consequences).
Leftow himself holds that logic and mathematics are not external to
God, since they arise out of God&rsquo;s nature, but he notes that
even if this is incorrect, they should not be deemed genuine
<em>constraints</em>; they instead mark where possibilities run out.
He then argues that on several prominent accounts of the laws of
nature, these also cannot count as external constraints on God. Next,
he argues that although God cannot change the past, this is not an
external constraint, because if God is atemporal, then time is
God&rsquo;s creation, and if God is temporal, then time is just a
consequence of God&rsquo;s nature. Finally, Leftow argues that the
actions of free creatures cannot be treated as an external constraint:
after all, God permits any actions that occur, and always has the
power to destroy them (or to refrain from sustaining them in
existence.)</p>

<h3 id="ResRea">1.3 Responsive to Reasons</h3>

<p>
Human beings are limited in knowledge, rationality, and will-power. We
sometimes fail to grasp reasons for action. Even if we grasp them, we
sometimes fail to weigh them properly. And even if we grasp them and
weigh them properly, we sometimes nevertheless fail to act on them
appropriately (see the entry on
 <a href="../weakness-will/">weakness of will</a>).
 God, however, has no such limitations. As Brian Leftow puts it:
&ldquo;Omniscience guarantees that God fully grasps all the facts, and
the reason-giving force of any fact. Perfect wisdom or rationality
guarantees that He acts on His reasons&rdquo; (2023, 175; and see also
Pearce and Pruss 2012, 410&ndash;412). In a similar vein, Thomas Senor
writes:</p>

<blockquote>
God&rsquo;s reason for having the volition God has, and for performing
the action God does, is God&rsquo;s recognition of the reasons for
performing the action in question, God&rsquo;s knowing and
appreciating all the reasons for refraining from that action, and
God&rsquo;s seeing that the reasons for performing the action are
weightier than the reasons for refraining. It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s
understanding of the reasons that leads God to act as God does. (2008,
183)
</blockquote>

<p>
Acting in a way that responds to reasons is sometimes thought to be a
necessary condition for free action (Pearce and Pruss 2012, 411).
Senor appears to believe that it is sufficient (2008, 184), and
Swinburne thinks that is both necessary and sufficient: &ldquo;a
person is &lsquo;perfectly free&rsquo; iff his actions are governed by
reason alone&rdquo; (1977, 146).</p>

<p>
It is generally thought that if the reasons for God&rsquo;s acting a
certain way are decisive, then God will, necessarily, act that way
(Murphy 2017, 28). This might seem freedom-undermining, but defenders
of this condition on divine freedom disagree. In fact, they think that
infallibly acting on decisive reasons <em>is constitutive</em> of
perfect freedom. Fales, for example, claims that: &ldquo;For God,
[the] correct choice is as obvious as it can be. But that means that
God is perfectly free. His rationality functions flawlessly, unmarred
by ignorance, weak reasoning, or temptation. It turns out, then, that
God&rsquo;s freedom, precisely because it is perfect, represents a
limiting case of freedom&rdquo; (1994, 84, and see also Talbott 2009,
and Timpe 2014, 2016a, and 2016b). Clearly, on this view, alternative
possibilities are not always required for freedom.</p>

<p>
Two further points are worth mentioning. To say that God acts on
reasons needn&rsquo;t involve the claim that God engages in discursive
reasoning in the way that humans do. Even if God just
&lsquo;sees&rsquo; directly what reason dictates, and acts
accordingly, it can still be maintained that God acts on reasons
(Fales 1994, 83). Second, those who hold that God is perfectly
responsive to reasons needn&rsquo;t require that God can freely &phi;
only if there are undefeated reasons to &phi;. Swinburne (1977), for
example, thinks that if there are two equally good actions, and God
can only perform one of them, then God can still <em>freely</em>
choose, even if reason favours neither choice. (For more on this
scenario, see section 2.3 below.)</p>

<h3 id="AgeCauUltSou">1.4 Agent Causation / Ultimate Sourcehood</h3>

<p>
Because God&rsquo;s actions are neither caused nor determined by
anything outside of himself, God is often taken to be the <em>ultimate
source</em> of his actions. Sometimes this idea is expressed in the
language of <em>agent
 causation</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 On this view, God is the sole cause of God&rsquo;s actions, or, as
Thomas Talbott puts it, God is &ldquo;the uncaused cause of every
event he causes to occur&rdquo; (2009, 380). Importantly, agent
causation does not reduce to event causation on this view, since the
agent, God, is the ultimate source of action, rather than some event
involving God. A bit more specification is required. As Graham Oppy
notes, agent causation should be <em>non-chancy</em>,
<em>non-deviant</em>, and there should be no internal defeating
conditions on freedom of action, such as addiction or psychological
disorder (2014, 255&ndash;6). Clearly, no such conditions obtain in
God&rsquo;s case. This model of divine freedom is popular in the
literature; for elaborations and defences of it, see Wierenga (2002),
Senor (2008), Couenhoven (2012, 2023), Talbott (2009), Timpe (2014),
and Daeley (2021).</p>

<p>
A typical objection to ultimate sourcehood accounts of freedom is that
it is at best mysterious, and at worst incoherent, to say that an
agent causes actions in a way that is not reducible to causation by
mental states or events. As Thomas Talbott expresses the worry:
&ldquo;when agency theorists appeal to agent causation in an effort to
distinguish a free choice, uncaused by any events, from random chance,
they too often merely deepen the very mystery that they are trying to
explain away&rdquo; (2009, 384). (For elaborations of this worry, and
discussion of replies, see
 <a href="../freewill/#LibeAccoSour">section 2.5 of the entry on free will</a>
 and
 <a href="../incompatibilism-theories/#3.3">section 3.3. of the entry on incompatibilist (non-deterministic) theories of free will</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
A second objection to this model of divine freedom is that it
conflicts with the idea that God acts on reasons. Rebekah Rice
articulates this concern as follows: &ldquo;The challenge for the pure
agency view concerns its ability to ascribe to reasons their proper
role as motivators of action. If we&rsquo;re willing to grant that in
acting, God acts for a reason (or a set of reasons), where that reason
motivates God to so act, then there will be some true account of
reasons explanation for divine action.&rdquo; On the agent-causal
view, however, &ldquo;[w]hat explains God&rsquo;s forming the relevant
intention [to act] is his exercise of agent-causal power. But this is
not to give a <em>reasons</em> explanation since it remains altogether
unclear in what sense the intention was formed for a reason&rdquo;
(2016, 267, emphasis
 added).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 For responses to this sort of worry in the human case, Clarke (2003,
Chapter 8).</p>

<p>
Another objection holds that if God&rsquo;s <em>nature</em> fully
determines how God will act, then this undermines freedom as much as
external determination
 would.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 William Alston rejects this out of hand, saying: &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
activity is the activity of a free agent in the most unqualified
sense. Not only are the things He directly brings about the result of
&lsquo;agent causality&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;event
causality,&rsquo; even where the events or states are states of His
own psyche; it is also the case, if this is indeed a separate point,
that no exercise of this agent causality is determined by anything,
not even by states of Himself&rdquo; (1988, 269, as quoted in Rice
2016, 259). But Wes Morriston (2006), in contrast, defends this
objection by invoking the following thought experiment. He imagines a
finite person named Bonnie Chance who comes to exist purely by chance,
without any external cause whatsoever, and whose nature prevents her
from ever choosing other than what rationality and morality require.
Morriston thinks it&rsquo;s perfectly clear that Bonnie should not be
deemed free: &ldquo;[s]ince it is Bonnie&rsquo;s nature &ndash; and
not Bonnie herself &ndash; that is responsible for her good behavior,
we can only conclude that she is not acting freely&rdquo;
 (96).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 Likewise, Morriston thinks, an agent-causal account will not work for
divine freedom.</p>

<p>
Here are three responses to this objection. First, some hold that it
is a mistake to distinguish between God and God&rsquo;s nature, since
the two are identical. This is a version of the <em>doctrine of divine
simplicity</em> (see the
 <a href="../divine-simplicity/">entry on divine simplicity</a>).
 If this view is correct, then there can be no sense in which God is
rendered unfree by God&rsquo;s
 nature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 A second response attacks the Bonnie Chance example. Talbott (2009)
distinguishes between <em>essence</em> and <em>nature</em>. The former
is the set of a thing&rsquo;s essential properties; the latter is a
person&rsquo;s accidental character traits, behavioural dispositions,
and the like. Talbott grants that an ordinary person&rsquo;s nature,
in this latter sense, can indeed be part of a causal explanation of
action, such as when someone with an honest character tells the truth.
But, Talbott thinks, this is irrelevant to the present objection, and
so he says that Morriston must have God&rsquo;s <em>essence</em> in
mind. Talbott then points out that an essence is an abstract object,
and hence is causally inert &ndash; in which case it cannot abrogate
God&rsquo;s freedom.</p>

<p>
A third response attempts to place the locus of God&rsquo;s ultimate
control <em>logically</em> <em>prior to</em> God&rsquo;s nature, by
holding that God <em>causes</em> God&rsquo;s nature. This strategy is
defended by Morris and Menzel (1986) and Morris (1987). Morris and
Menzel defend a view called <em>theistic activism</em>, according to
which necessarily existing abstract objects like numbers, properties,
and propositions (together with their truth values and modal status)
are quite literally caused by God&rsquo;s &ldquo;efficacious
intellective activity&rdquo; (1986, 356). They apply this view to
God&rsquo;s nature, and insist that it does not commit them to the
(absurd) claim that God is temporally or metaphysically prior to God.
Morriston, however, disagrees: &ldquo;In sum, it is hard to see how
God could create anything without (already, prior to creating it)
having a nature that makes it possible for him to create it. If,
therefore, God causes his own nature, his nature must be at least part
of its own cause, and the dread spectre of self-causation rears its
ugly head&rdquo; (2000, 357; 2006.). Similarly, Bergmann and Cover
(2006) hold that on this view, God&rsquo;s exerting his causal power
to cause divine properties is both logically prior to <em>and</em>
logically posterior to his exemplifiying the property of having causal
powers &ndash; which is incoherent. William Rowe (2004, Chapter 7)
agrees that this view is incoherent &ndash; but also holds that even
if it is coherent, it will not suffice to secure God&rsquo;s freedom.
According to Rowe, freedom requires the ability to choose between
alternate possibilities, but God has no such choice with respect to
causing his nature. God&rsquo;s nature, after all, is essential to
God, and God exists in all possible worlds, so God could not have had
a different nature than God has. This particular objection, however,
is not likely to persuade those who favour ultimate sourcehood over
alternative possibilities in their account of divine freedom in the
first place.</p>

<h2 id="App">2. Applications</h2>

<p>
This section sets out the role that divine freedom plays in seven
discussions in contemporary philosophy of religion. The first is about
whether there is a conflict between two divine attributes: omnipotence
and perfect goodness. The second is about whether God can be deemed
free if there is precisely one best of all possible worlds. The third
is about whether God can be deemed free if there are multiple
unsurpassable worlds (which are either tied or incomparable in value).
The fourth is about whether, if God must select an unsurpassable
world, this leads to some form of modal collapse. The fifth is about
whether God can be deemed free if there are no unsurpassable worlds,
but rather an infinite hierarchy of increasingly better worlds. The
sixth is about how divine freedom connects to the appropriateness of
thanking, praising, and worshipping God. The final subsection examines
the role that divine freedom plays in certain arguments for and
against God&rsquo;s existence.</p>

<h3 id="OmnMorPerDivFre">2.1 Omnipotence, Moral Perfection, and Divine Freedom</h3>

<p>
God is traditionally taken to be both omnipotent and perfectly good,
and, moreover, <em>essentially</em> so. Perfect goodness is generally
understood to involve <em>moral</em> perfection, so God is thought to
be essentially morally perfect as well. Given that God exists
necessarily, this means that there is no possible world in which God
fails to be omnipotent or morally perfect. But there seems to be a
tension between these two attributes. It is natural to think that
omnipotence includes the power to act in ways inconsistent with moral
perfection. It is also natural to think that one can have this power
only if there is at least one possible world in which one acts in such
a way. But, of course, if there is a possible world in which God acts
in a morally imperfect fashion, then God is not <em>essentially</em>
morally perfect. If this reasoning is correct, and if omnipotence and
moral perfection are essential properties of God, then this model of
God is self-contradictory &ndash; in which case God, so construed,
cannot exist. We next turn discuss five responses to this challenge
found in the literature, with a brief note on how each one pertains to
divine freedom.</p>

<p>
The most obvious way to resolve this tension is to jettison either
omnipotence or moral perfection from one&rsquo;s concept of God. Peter
Geach (1973) famously recommends the former, while J. Gregory Keller
(2010) recommends the latter, saying that moral perfection is an
incoherent
 attribute.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Morriston (2001) defends a variant of this strategy, suggesting that
the best possible <em>combination</em> of attributes needn&rsquo;t
include both omnipotence and moral perfection. This idea can be
fleshed out in three ways. The first privileges the former, by
insisting that God is omnipotent while holding that God&rsquo;s moral
goodness is as great as it can be, consistent with omnipotence. The
second way, which Morriston endorses, privileges the latter, by
insisting that God is morally perfect, and as powerful can be,
consistent with moral perfection. The third way holds that God has the
greatest amount of power and moral goodness that a being can have,
even if God is neither omnipotent nor morally
 perfect.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Retaining omnipotence in one&rsquo;s concept of God, while
jettisoning moral perfection, can help to preserve God&rsquo;s freedom
&ndash; at least if divine freedom requires alternate possibilities.
That&rsquo;s because on this view, one can hold that it is within
God&rsquo;s power to act in ways inconsistent with moral perfection,
which is another way of saying that these are genuine possibilities.
But it is not clear that giving up moral perfection can help with the
reasons-responsiveness model of divine freedom: what reason could God
have, after all, for acting in a morally imperfect way in any possible
world? Giving up omnipotence, on the other hand, restricts the scope
of divine freedom on an alternate-possibility model of divine freedom,
since then God would presumably be unable to perform some logically
possible actions. But prioritizing moral perfection at the expense of
omnipotence avoids the worry for the reasons-responsiveness model of
divine freedom just mentioned. Either move seems compatible with
models of divine freedom that prioritize ultimate sourcehood or
freedom from external causes. All that said, giving up either
omnipotence or moral perfection is costly, given that these are widely
thought to be non-negotiable divine attributes.</p>

<p>
A second way to resolve the tension holds that God is either
<em>contingently</em> omnipotent or <em>contingently</em> morally
perfect. On this view, either or both are indeed attributes of God,
but not <em>essential</em> attributes: there are worlds in which God
fails to exhibit one, or even
 both.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 Guleserian (1985, 2000) thinks that God is essentially omnipotent,
and that, accordingly, it is logically possible for God to perform
actions inconsistent with moral perfection. But given this, he argues,
God should not be thought <em>essentially</em> morally perfect.
Guleserian further argues that a <em>non</em>-essentially morally
perfect being should be thought to be <em>superior to</em> an
essentially morally perfect
 being.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 As with the previous strategy, giving up essential moral perfection
in this way can be thought to preserve God&rsquo;s freedom &ndash; at
least if divine freedom requires alternate possibilities. But, as
before, it is not clear that that this move can help with a
reasons-responsiveness model of divine freedom, because it seems that
God could have no reason for acting in a morally imperfect way in any
possible world. Meanwhile, this move seems compatible with models of
divine freedom that prioritize ultimate sourcehood, or freedom from
external causes. But again, all that said, giving up essential moral
perfection is still costly, since it is widely thought that this
attribute is essential to God.</p>

<p>
A third strategy for resolving this tension holds that it is logically
impossible for God to act in any way inconsistent with moral
perfection, and accordingly, that God&rsquo;s inability to do so
should not be thought to count against
 omnipotence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 One version of this strategy holds that although it is a
<em>power</em> for <em>us</em> to be able to act in ways inconsistent
with moral perfection, this is not a power for God &ndash; it is,
instead, a <em>liability</em>. (Or, more precisely, it <em>would
be</em> a liability if God were able to act in ways inconsistent with
moral perfection, and so God&rsquo;s inability to do so does not
threaten God&rsquo;s omnipotence.) T.J. Mawson (2005a, 2005b, 2017)
argues that the ability to act in morally imperfect ways is only
plausibly a power when one is in a situation where one desires an
outcome that one reasonably believes one can only achieve by acting in
such a way. We frail human beings are all-too-familiar with such
desires &ndash; but God, of course, has no such desires. Accordingly,
Mawson thinks, acting in a fashion inconsistent with moral perfection
is not a power for God, but a
 liability.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 On this view, God can be thought to freely act in a morally perfect
way on three models of divine freedom: God is free from external
constraints, God is the ultimate source of God&rsquo;s actions, and
God is responsive to (morally relevant) reasons. But if, on this
model, there are no alternate possibilities in which God acts in ways
inconsistent with moral perfection, and if freedom requires such
possibilities, then God cannot be free.</p>

<p>
In an important paper, Pike (1969) rejects the idea that it is
logically impossible for God to act in any way inconsistent with moral
perfection. Pike holds that while it is logically impossible for God
to create a square circle or a married bachelor, because these are not
consistently describable entities, there is no such logical
impossibility involved in the case at hand. Moreover, Pike thinks,
true moral perfection requires one to have the <em>ability</em> to
perform morally imperfect actions, while also having the <em>strength
of character</em> to refrain. Accordingly, Pike thinks that it is
logically possible for God to act in a morally imperfect way, but that
since doing so would be &ldquo;contrary to a firm and stable feature
of His nature&rdquo;, we have &ldquo;complete assurance that He will
not exercise this ability&rdquo; (216). Thus, he thinks, essential
omnipotence and essential moral perfection are compatible &ndash; and
so this constitutes a fourth way to resolve the tension. The problem
with this move is that &lsquo;complete assurance&rsquo; that God will
not exercise this ability is naturally read as either expressing or
entailing the modal claim that there is no possible world in which God
exercises this ability &ndash; but Pike insists that there are such
 worlds.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 At any rate, on Pike&rsquo;s account, the &lsquo;complete
assurance&rsquo; that God will not act in a morally imperfect way is
difficult to square with an account of divine freedom that requires
alternate possibilities. But insofar as it preserves omnipotence,
Pike&rsquo;s account comports well with accounts of divine freedom
that involve the absence of external constraints, and being the
ultimate source of one&rsquo;s actions. Moreover, if Pike&rsquo;s
model is coherent, it does seem that God is maximally responsive to
(morally relevant) reasons, so it fits well with this view of divine
freedom
 too.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A fifth way to resolve the tension holds that God&rsquo;s power is not
restricted to logical possibility (Talbott 1988). Suppose that God, as
a morally perfect being, will ensure that in every world the following
proposition is true:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(P)</dt>
<dd>There is a favourable balance of good over evil.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this supposition, and given theism, (P) is a necessary truth. Now,
it is also a necessary truth that:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(Q)</dt>
<dd>2 + 2 = 4.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
But God does not <em>bring about</em> the truth of (Q), nor is there
anything that God could do to bring about the falsity of (Q). In
contrast, Talbott says, God does indeed <em>bring about</em> the truth
of (P), and, equally, there is something that God could do to bring
about its falsity. Accordingly, Talbott thinks, God should be deemed
to <em>have the power</em> to perform morally imperfect actions, even
though these are logically impossible, given his essential moral
perfection. In a move reminiscent of Pike (1969), Talbott thinks that
God could exercise this power if he wanted to &ndash; but insists that
God will never want to. And &ldquo;since, moreover, his refusal to
exercise these powers is in no way determined by antecedent causal
conditions outside his control, he is, in the fullest sense, free to
exercise them. He is, in the fullest sense, free to exercise his power
to bring about certain impossible states of affairs&rdquo; (Talbott
1988,
 9).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 Evidently, Talbott thinks that this model renders God free in one
sense: God is not subject to any external constraints. Moreover,
Talbott&rsquo;s model also fits well with the view that God&rsquo;s
freedom requires ultimate sourcehood or agent causation, and with the
reasons-responsiveness account of freedom. It is less clear, however,
that this model helps with the alternate possibilities requirement for
freedom. After all, appealing to logical <em>im</em>possibilities
cannot help to establish alternate (logical) possibilities. At any
rate, this move has not been well-received. For example, Zachary Manis
says &ldquo;I cannot fathom how Talbott&rsquo;s thesis could be
true&rdquo; (2011, n.14), and Rowe dismisses Talbott&rsquo;s view as
&ldquo;&hellip; an instance of &lsquo;language gone on
holiday&rsquo;&rdquo; (2004, 149). These authors think it is
straightforwardly incoherent to hold that God has the power to perform
logically impossible tasks.</p>

<h3 id="DivFreIfTheOneBesPosWor">2.2 Divine Freedom if there is One Best Possible World</h3>

<p>
As noted, God is held to be the creator and sustainer of all that
contingently
 exists.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 This idea is typically expressed in the language of <em>worlds</em>.
God is pictured as surveying the vast array of possible worlds, and
choosing exactly one to be the actual world. This is called
<em>actualizing</em> a
 world.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 When thinking this way, it is tempting to imagine (a) that God stands
<em>outside</em> this landscape of possible worlds in order to survey
them; that (b) God <em>creates</em> something in every possible world;
that (c) God determines each and every feature of the ensuing world
(d) all at once. The first of these claims is false, and the rest are
often denied.</p>

<p>
Regarding (a): God, as a necessary being, exists in every possible
world. On this view, no sense can be made of the idea that God stands
<em>outside</em> of the ensemble of worlds in order to select one for
actualization. Since the possible worlds there are exhaust the way
that things could be, there simply is no vantage point, divine or
otherwise, entirely outside this ensemble. As for (b): while it is
tempting to conflate world-actualization and creation, it is important
to keep them distinct. Creation occurs, let&rsquo;s say, when God
causes some spatiotemporal entity to be actual, but it&rsquo;s not the
case that every instance of world-actualization involves this. Suppose
that God exists, but creates nothing at all. If so, there still is an
actual world. God, of course, is still responsible for this
world&rsquo;s being actual, and so it makes sense to say that God has
actualized it, without creating anything.</p>

<p>
With respect to (c), God&rsquo;s actualizing a world need not mean
that he determines each and every feature of the resulting world.
Consider, for example, random processes. If a world includes these,
then God causes it to be the case that they occur, but he does not
determine their outcome. Next, consider a world that includes
libertarian-free creatures. Free choices made by these beings shape
how the world unfolds, so it makes sense to say that such worlds are
<em>jointly</em> actualized by God and by these creatures. As for (d),
there is no need to suppose that God&rsquo;s causal activity in
actualizing a world is limited to one act at the (temporal or logical)
beginning of that world. Some theists hold that God intervenes from
time to time, and on this view, God performs many world-actualizing
actions throughout the history of the world being actualized. In
addition, as we have seen, theism holds that God&rsquo;s
world-actualizing activity includes <em>sustaining</em> whatever is
actual. This also suggests that God&rsquo;s actualizing activity does
not occur &lsquo;all at once&rsquo; at the outset of a world.</p>

<p>
On what <em>basis</em> does God choose a world to actualize? It is
widely taken for granted in this literature that each world has an
objective, overall axiological status. On this view, it makes sense to
say that one world is good and another is bad, or that one world is
better than, or worse than, another. God, as an omniscient being, is
taken to know the axiological status of each world, and this knowledge
informs God&rsquo;s choice.</p>

<p>
It is generally held that there are three candidate hierarchies of
possible worlds. First, perhaps there is exactly one best of all
possible worlds. Second, perhaps the hierarchy of worlds has an upper
bound, but no unique world at the top. This could happen in two
different ways. Perhaps there are two or more <em>equally</em> good
unsurpassable worlds. These might include <em>duplicates</em>, or
near-duplicates: worlds that differ from each other in only trivial or
axiologically irrelevant ways. Alternatively, perhaps there are two or
more worlds that are unsurpassed, but that are incomparable with each
 other.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
 Third, perhaps there are no unsurpassable worlds at all, but instead
an infinite hierarchy of increasingly better worlds.</p>

<p>
God&rsquo;s freedom has been discussed on each of these four
scenarios. The first scenario is discussed in this section, the
second scenario in section 2.3, and the third scenario in section
 2.5.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 While the literature tends to focus on God&rsquo;s choice of a world,
the issues generalize to any case of God&rsquo;s action (assuming that
these actions have objective axiological status). In principle, God
might find himself in a situation where there is exactly one best
action to perform, or several unsurpassable actions (whether equal or
incomparable), or no best action.</p>

<p>
If there is exactly one best of all possible worlds, it is natural to
think that God will select it. On the accounts of divine freedom set
out in sections 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, this poses no problem for
God&rsquo;s freedom: in choosing the best world, God is maximally
responsive to reasons, is not constrained by anything external, and is
the ultimate source of his action. But if freedom requires alternate
possibilities, as the model discussed in section 1.1 suggests, then
God&rsquo;s choice of the best possible world is free only if God
could have chosen a suboptimal world instead. Robert Adams offers a
partial, indirect argument for the claim that God could indeed have
chosen a suboptimal world, by criticizing two reasons for thinking
that God would choose the best
 world:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup></p>
 
<blockquote>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(Q)</dt>
<dd>A creator would necessarily wrong someone (violate someone&rsquo;s
rights), or be less kind to someone than a perfectly good moral agent
must be, if he knowingly actualized a less excellent world instead of
the best that he could.</dd>
<dt>(R)</dt>
<dd>Even if no one would be wronged or treated unkindly by the
actualization of an inferior world, the creator&rsquo;s choice of an
inferior world must manifest a defect of character.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Adams argues that God could actualize a sub-optimal world with the
following characteristics:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(S)</dt>
<dd>none of the individual creatures in it would exist in the best of
all possible worlds;</dd>
<dt>(T)</dt>
<dd>none of the creatures in it has a life which is so miserable on
the whole that it would have been better for that creature if it had
never existed; and</dd>
<dt>(U)</dt>
<dd>every individual creature in the world is at least as happy on the
whole as it would have been in any other possible world in which it
could have existed.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Against (Q), Adams thinks it obvious that if God were to actualize a
world with characteristics (S), (T), and (U), God would neither wrong
anyone nor be less than perfectly kind to anyone. Against (R), Adams
claims that, far from manifesting a defect of character, God&rsquo;s
choice of an inferior world could manifest the Judeo-Christian virtue
of <em>grace</em>, which he defines as &lsquo;&hellip; a disposition
to love which is not dependent on the merit of the person loved&rsquo;
(97&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Adams&rsquo; attacks on (Q) and (R) have not been well-received. With
respect to (Q), Michael Levine argues that &lsquo;&hellip;the
criterion of personal identity Adams&rsquo; argument rests upon is
both stipulative and counterintuitive&rsquo; (1996, 31). David
Basinger grants Adam&rsquo;s account of personal identity, but insists
that even if God actualizes a world with characteristics (S), (T), and
(U), it may still be the case that God wrongs individuals in that
world
 (1983).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 With respect to (R), many authors have criticized Adams&rsquo; appeal
to grace. Most of these authors object either to Adams&rsquo;
understanding of this virtue or its application to this issue (e.g.
Basinger 1983; Thomas 1996; Gale 1991; Grover 2003). In contrast, Erik
Wielenberg suggests that even if God exhibits the virtue of grace in
actualizing a world other than the best, God also exhibits the
<em>absence</em> of a different virtuous trait: the disposition to
pursue intrinsically valuable states proportionally (2004,
51&ndash;2). Accordingly, Wielenberg thinks, God&rsquo;s action in
selecting a sub-optimal world would manifest a defect of character,
just as (R) says.</p>

<p>
Moreover, and importantly, William Rowe argues that even if Adams
achieves his stated goals of undermining (Q) and (R), this is
insufficient for showing that God can select a suboptimal world:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As forceful and persuasive as Adams&rsquo;s arguments are, I
don&rsquo;t think they yield the conclusion that God&rsquo;s perfect
goodness imposes no requirement on God to [actualize] the best world
that he can &hellip; What Adams&rsquo;s argument show, at best, is
that God&rsquo;s moral perfection imposes no <em>moral obligation</em>
on God to [actualize] the best world he can. His arguments establish,
at best, that God need not be doing anything <em>morally wrong</em> in
[actualizing] some other world than the best world. But this
isn&rsquo;t quite the same thing as showing that God&rsquo;s perfect
goodness does not render it necessary that he [actualize] the best
world he can (1993, 228, and see 2004, 82. See also Wierenga
2002).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rowe holds that if God fails to actualize the best possible world,
then God&rsquo;s action in selecting a sub-optimal world is
surpassable. And, he says, if God&rsquo;s action is surpassable, then
<em>God</em> is surpassable (1993, 2004). Others have agreed,
sometimes by suggesting that God&rsquo;s choosing the sub-optimal over
the optimal would indicate surpassability with respect to goodness,
and sometimes by suggesting that it would indicate surpassability with
respect to
 rationality.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
One way to resist the idea that God must choose the optimal over the
sub-optimal is to invoke <em>satisficing</em>. Defenders of
satisficing hold that it can be morally or rationally acceptable to
choose the worse over the better. Indeed, Adams&rsquo; argument
involves an implicit appeal to divine
 satisficing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup>
 He holds that <em>human</em> satisficing, in relevantly similar
choice situations, is morally and rationally acceptable &ndash; and
then Adams suggests that, by parity of reasoning, divine satisficing
is likewise acceptable. Thus, for example, Adams considers the case of
a man who decides to breed goldfish instead of more excellent beings
such as cats or dogs. Adams suggests that the breeder satisfices by
choosing a <em>good enough</em> species to breed, and says that there
is nothing immoral or irrational in so doing, even if the breeder
could have chosen a more excellent species instead (1972, 329). Adams
thinks that God can likewise satisfice in his selection of a world, by
choosing a sub-optimal one that is nevertheless <em>good enough</em>.
Adams&rsquo; (S), (T), and (U) thus constitute a partial account of
the sort of world that would be good enough for God to actualize.
Kraay (2013) offers arguments against the intelligibility of divine
satisficing. Tucker (2016) argues that Adam&rsquo;s argument should be
construed as invoking <em>motivated submaximization</em> instead of
satisficing, and defends Adams&rsquo; claim on this interpretation.
Kraay (2021) responds to Tucker (2016).</p>

<h3 id="DivFreIfTheEquGooIncUnsWor">2.3 Divine Freedom if there are Equally Good, or Incomparable, Unsurpassable Worlds</h3>

<p>
Suppose that there is not just one unique best of all possible worlds,
but multiple unsurpassable worlds. This could happen in several ways.
Perhaps there are <em>duplicate</em> unsurpassable worlds, or perhaps
there are <em>near-duplicates</em> that differ from each other in
trivial ways, or, at any rate, axiologically irrelevant ways. All such
worlds would be &lsquo;axiologically tied&rsquo;, so to speak: they
would be equal to each other in unsurpassable value.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, perhaps there are failures of comparability between
worlds, all of which are nevertheless unsurpassed by any other
 world.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup>
 Here are two ways that this could occur. First, there might not be
one set of axiological criteria relevant to <em>all</em> worlds:
perhaps some worlds are properly to be evaluated by one set of
axiological criteria; and other worlds are properly to be evaluated by
a different set. Let&rsquo;s say that pairs of worlds that cannot be
evaluated by a common set of axiological criteria are
<em>incommensurable</em>. No two incommensurable worlds are overall
comparable &ndash; precisely because there is no basis for
 comparison.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 Second, even if all worlds are <em>commensurable</em> with each
other, there might still be failures of <em>comparability</em> between
them. Here are two ways this could happen:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Consider a comparison between two philosophers, Eunice and Janice,
with respect to philosophical talent (Chang 1997, 22&ndash;23).
Plausibly, there are multiple good-making properties of philosophers
(originality, insightfulness, clarity of thought, clarity of
expression, and the like), and perhaps there is no single best way to
weigh the contributing effects of these on overall talent. Perhaps
Eunice surpasses Janice with respect to some properties, but Janice
surpasses Eunice with respect to others. If no such
&lsquo;sharpening&rsquo; is privileged, one might argue that the two
philosophers are incomparable, even though they are commensurable with
respect to the set of philosophical good-making properties. Arguments
like this can be generalized to worlds: if there are multiple
legitimate ways to rank a pair of commensurable worlds with respect to
a common set of axiological properties, they are incomparable.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
Several philosophers have argued that when neither of two items
surpasses the other, but when a minor improvement to one item fails to
make it better than the other, it is reasonable to deem these items
incomparable. Inspired by an example given by Raz (1986), Mann (1991,
270&ndash;1) imagines an individual&rsquo;s choice between two
different careers. Teresa, in Mann&rsquo;s story, is faced with the
choice between a vocation serving the dying poor in Calcutta, and a
successful operatic
 career.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>
 Mann stipulates that neither option can be pursued fully without
detriment to the other, and urges that neither option surpasses the
other. Nor are they exactly equal, says Mann, since this would mean
(for example) that one additional outstanding performance of
<em>Tosca</em> would &ndash; absurdly &ndash; make that career surpass
the career in which Teresa serves the poor, and thereby justify
Teresa&rsquo;s choice of a musical career. Again, this sort of
argument can be generalized to worlds: if the states of affairs
consisting in Teresa&rsquo;s alternative careers are incomparable,
perhaps worlds that include them, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, are
incomparable
 too.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup></p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Suppose, then, that God is faced with a hierarchy of worlds that has
an upper bound, but no <em>unique</em> unsurpassable world, either
because there are duplicates (or near-duplicates) at the top, or
because there are failures of comparability between unsurpassable
worlds in any of the ways just set out. Against this backdrop,
defenders of divine satisficing (like Adams) can hold that God could
defensibly choose one of the suboptimal worlds (so long as it is
sufficiently good). If this move succeeds, and if alternate
possibilities are required for freedom, then one could say that God is
free to choose one of the unsurpassable worlds, or else one of the
surpassable-but-sufficiently-good ones.</p>

<p>
But suppose instead that, given God&rsquo;s goodness and rationality,
God <em>must</em> choose one of the unsurpassable worlds. On this
view, if divine freedom requires alternate possibilities, then God
could not be deemed free in one important sense: God could not be said
to freely choose an unsurpassable world in lieu of a surpassable one.
(Of course, if either responsiveness to reasons, lack of external
constraints, or ultimate sourcehood are sufficient for divine freedom,
then one could still hold that God will <em>freely</em> select an
unsurpassable world in lieu of a surpassable one.)</p>

<p>
On this scenario, there are many alternative unsurpassable worlds that
God might have chosen instead of the one that God chooses. So, if
alternate possibilities are necessary for freedom, then one could hold
that there is a <em>different</em> sense in which God is free: God
freely chooses one of the unsurpassable worlds instead of any other
one. (Equally, of course, if lack of external constraints, or ultimate
sourcehood, are sufficient for divine freedom, then God could
plausibly be deemed free in this way as well.) For defences of divine
freedom along these lines, see Swinburne (1977), Flint (1983), Garcia
(1992), Pruss (2016), and Mawson (2017).</p>

<p>
Some authors, however, hold that either (a) God is not free with
respect to choosing one out of the many unsurpassable worlds, or that
(b) God&rsquo;s freedom is trivial in this case. David Mason is in the
former camp, saying that this is &ldquo;not so much a free decision as
something like the toss of a coin or sheer capriciousness&rdquo; (1982, 196).
Edward Wierenga agrees that this is not an adequate account of
God&rsquo;s freedom, &ldquo;&hellip; for it amounts to saying that God
is free only <em>when it does not matter what he does</em>&rdquo; and
that God &ldquo;might as well choose blindly or arbitrarily&rdquo;
(433). Thomas Senor is in the latter camp, at least with respect to a
choice between duplicates or trivially different worlds, saying that
in such a case, God&rsquo;s &ldquo;freedom is strictly
superficial&rdquo; (2008, 191).</p>

<p>
Those who think that God is unfree (or has only trivial freedom) in
such cases seem to be driven by the responsiveness-to-reasons account
of divine freedom. After all, it seems that God could have <em>no
rational basis</em> for choosing one unsurpassable world from a set of
duplicates or trivially-different alternatives, or between
incomparable unsurpassable worlds. The image of God&rsquo;s being
faced with a choice between multiple unsurpassable worlds, and lacking
a rational basis for choosing any of them, calls to mind the infamous
story of Burdian&rsquo;s ass, in which a donkey is equally distant
from two bales of hay, and, lacking a rational basis for choosing one
over the other, starves to
 death.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 It&rsquo;s important to see that God&rsquo;s situation is different
in one important respect: the donkey can refrain from choosing a bale
of hay, but God cannot refrain from actualizing a world. Still, the
crucial similarity is this: just as the donkey lacks a reason for
preferring one haybale over the other, so too God lacks a rational
basis for choosing any unsurpassable world over all of the others.
However, some authors think that even if God <em>lacks a reason</em>
for selecting one unsurpassable world over another, it does not follow
that God <em>acts</em> <em>irrationally</em>. Strickland (2006)
defends the claim that it is rational for God to choose randomly. (For
criticisms, see Kraay 2008a.) A different model holds that in this
case, it is rational for God to <em>just pick</em> a world, in the
sense defended by Ullman-Margalit and Morgenbesser (1977). (See Murphy
2017, 40 and Garcia 1992, 198&ndash;199). If any such choice procedure
is rationally defensible, then it can be harnessed to argue that God
meets the responsiveness-to-reasons requirement for freedom, at least
in a certain way.</p>

<p>
Recently, several authors have developed more robust models of how God
can freely choose between incomparable unsurpassable worlds. They hold
that God&rsquo;s choice can legitimately be driven by God&rsquo;s
<em>brute preferences</em> (Senor 2008, Leftow 2017, Wilson 2022) or
because God is <em>impressed by</em> certain features of a world
(Pruss 2016), or that God&rsquo;s choice can be understood as an
expression of God&rsquo;s <em>individuality, personality,</em> or
<em>character</em> (Leftow 2019, Draper
 2019).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup>
 It might seem difficult to square these accounts with the
responsiveness-to-reasons condition for freedom, because the proffered
bases for these choices do not seem rational. There are, however,
various ways to respond to this challenge. Leftow (2017) grants that
God might not have <em>reasons</em> for his preferences, but holds
that it is nevertheless more rational to <em>act on</em> one&rsquo;s
preferences than to ignore them and choose arbitrarily. The same point
could be made for the models developed by Pruss (2016) and Draper
(2019). For his part, Pruss (2016) argues that God&rsquo;s being
<em>impressed by</em> certain features of a world can constitute a
contrastive explanation of why God chose it over other incomparable
alternatives, and that this renders God&rsquo;s choice rationally
intelligible.</p>

<h3 id="IntModCol">2.4 Interlude: Modal Collapse</h3>

<p>
The discussion in section 2.2. assumed that, given theism, it is
coherent to picture modal space as including a unique best of all
possible worlds <em>as well as</em> a vast array of suboptimal worlds.
Likewise, the discussion in section 2.3. assumed that, given theism,
it is coherent to picture modal space as including multiple optimal
worlds <em>as well as a</em> vast array of suboptimal worlds. But
there are reasons to doubt whether these pictures are coherent on
theism.</p>

<p>
To see why, consider some ways in which modal space is different on
theism as opposed to naturalism. Here are two quick examples. On
naturalism, it is very plausible that some evils are gratuitous,
either in the actual world or in other possible worlds. But many
authors have held that if theism is true, then gratuitous evil is
impossible: it exists in no possible world. Meanwhile, it is widely
held that if theism is true, then it is possible to have a personal
relationship with God &ndash; but of course this is impossible on
naturalism. In short, if God exists, then some things that would
otherwise have been possible are not possible, and vice versa. Thomas
Morris connects these ideas by saying that God is &ldquo;a delimiter
of possibilities&rdquo; (1987, 48); Brian Leftow illuminates them with
the image of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;modal footprint&rdquo; (2005, 96;
2010, 30). Morris extends this thought to <em>worlds</em> as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
If there is a being who exists necessarily, and is necessarily
omnipotent, omniscient, and good, then many states of affairs which
otherwise would represent genuine possibilities, and which by all
non-theistic tests of logic and semantics do represent possibilities,
are strictly impossible in the strongest sense. In particular, worlds
containing certain sorts of disvalue or evil are metaphysically ruled
out by the nature of God, divinely precluded from the realm of real
possibility (48).
</blockquote>

<p>
What sorts of worlds are possible on naturalism but impossible on
theism? Alvin Plantinga thinks that on theism, modal space includes no
worlds that fail to be &lsquo;very good&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A]ll possible worlds &hellip; are very good. For God is unlimited in
goodness and holiness, as well as in power and knowledge; these
properties, furthermore, are essential to him; and this means, I
believe, that God not only has created [i.e. actualized] a world that
is very good, but that there aren&rsquo;t any conditions under which
he would have created a world that is less than very good &hellip; The
class of possible worlds God&rsquo;s love and goodness prevents him
from actualizing is empty. All possible worlds, we might say, are
eligible worlds: worlds that God&rsquo;s goodness, mercy, and love
would permit him to actualize (2004, 8).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While Plantinga thinks that on theism, all worlds are &lsquo;very
good&rsquo;, it might seem natural to set the bar even higher. As we
have seen, some authors in the literature on divine freedom think
that, given God&rsquo;s perfect goodness and rationality, God must
choose an unsurpassable world. This is, of course, the highest
possible bar. But on this view, it&rsquo;s tempting to think that
surpassable worlds are not genuine possibilities on theism after all.
If there is only one unique best of all possible worlds (the scenario
discussed in 2.1.), then, on this way of thinking, <em>total modal
collapse</em> ensues: on theism, there is only one possible world, and
nothing could be otherwise than it
 is.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup>
 If there are multiple unsurpassable worlds (in any of the scenarios
set out in 2.2.) then <em>partial</em> <em>modal collapse</em> ensues:
on theism, there are no surpassable worlds in modal space, only an
array of unsurpassable ones. In the former scenario, the lone world
turns out to be only trivially the &lsquo;best&rsquo;, and in the
latter scenarios, the worlds in modal space turn out to be only
trivially &lsquo;unsurpassable&rsquo;. Ideas along these lines are
briefly noted in Gale (1991, 31&ndash;32), Garcia (1992, 204),
Wainwright (1996, 127), and Wierenga (2007, 208), and more developed
arguments in this vein are offered by Resnick (1973) and Heller
(1999).</p>

<p>
Considerations like these have been marshalled into an argument
against theism. In an important paper, Guleserian (1983) holds that
our modal intuitions strongly suggest that there are indeed
surpassable worlds in modal space. If the existence of God, as
traditionally construed, is incompatible with there being such worlds,
then these modal intuitions count against theism. For responses and
discussion, see Garcia (1984), Tidman (1993), Almeida (2011), Kraay
(2011b), and Mooney (2015). Bracketing this argument, it&rsquo;s clear
that <em>partial</em> modal collapse reduces the world-actualizing
alternatives available to God, and <em>total</em> modal collapse
eliminates them entirely. Accordingly, these scenarios imperil the
model of divine freedom that requires alternate possibilities.
However, modal collapse scenarios do not threaten models of divine
freedom that instead privilege the lack of external constraints,
responsiveness to reasons, or ultimate sourcehood.</p>

<h3 id="DivFreIfTheInfHieIncBetWor">2.5 Divine Freedom if there is an Infinite Hierarchy of Increasingly Better Worlds</h3>

<p>
Suppose that there are no unsurpassable worlds, but that there is,
instead, an infinite hierarchy of increasingly better worlds. This
appears to be the dominant view in contemporary analytic philosophy of
religion. (See, for example, Plantinga 1974, 61; Schlesinger 1977;
Forrest 1981; Reichenbach 1982, 121&ndash;9; Swinburne 1979,
114&ndash;5; and Rubio 2020.) Many philosophers hold that God&rsquo;s
choice of a world on this view can properly be thought free. Accounts
of divine freedom against this ontological backdrop are generally
developed in response to an argument for atheism called <em>the
problem of no best world</em>, and we turn to this
 now.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Various authors have suggested that, given an infinite hierarchy of
increasingly better worlds, and given some putatively plausible
principles about improvability, it can be shown that God does not
exist. (This argument is advanced in various ways by Grover 1988,
2003, 2004; Rowe 1993, 1994, 2002, 2004; Sobel 2004, pp.
468&ndash;479; and Wielenberg 2004). The core of this argument can be
expressed with reference to the following inconsistent set of
propositions:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>NBW</dt>
<dd>For every world w that is within God&rsquo;s power to actualize,
there is a better world, x, that God has the power to actualize
instead.</dd>
<dt>P1</dt>
<dd>If it is possible for the <em>product</em> of a world-actualizing
action performed by some being to have been better, then,
<em>ceteris</em> paribus, it is possible for that being&rsquo;s
<em>action</em> to have been (morally or rationally) better.</dd>
<dt>P2</dt>
<dd>If it is possible for the world-actualizing <em>action</em>
performed by some being to have been (morally or rationally) better,
then, ceteris paribus, it is possible for that <em>being</em> to have
been better.</dd>
<dt>G</dt>
<dd>There possibly exists a being who is essentially unsurpassable in
power, knowledge, goodness, and rationality.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Defenders of this argument urge that since this set is inconsistent,
and since P1 and P2 are plausible, defenders of NBW ought to reject G.
This amounts to an <em>a priori</em> argument for the
<em>impossibility</em> of an essentially unsurpassable God on
 NBW.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Those who are committed to both NBW and G can respond in several ways.
First, they can reverse the argument, by holding that G is more
plausible than the conjunction of P1 and P2. Second, they can
criticize P2. Since these criticisms do not typically invoke divine
freedom, they are not discussed further here.</p>

<p>
Some of the most prominent responses to this argument target P1, and
these sometimes involve or suggest claims about divine freedom. For
example, Bruce Langtry (2008, 74&ndash;78) explicitly invokes
<em>satisficing</em>. He asks what a correct theory of morality should
say about agents &ndash; divine or otherwise &ndash; who are forced to
choose one item from an infinite series of good and increasingly
better outcomes. He answers:</p>

<blockquote>
It should recommend that they satisfice &ndash; that is, that they
select some good state of affairs even though they could select a
better one. Therefore it should not also recommend, of each available
good state of affairs, that they not select that one. Therefore it
should not declare that, whichever state of affairs they select, there
is at least one alternative member of the hierarchy such that
selecting it would be a morally better action (78).
</blockquote>

<p>
Langtry similarly argues that a correct theory of rationality should
recommend that agents in such situations satisfice (76&ndash;7). In
short, then, Langtry denies (P1) on the grounds that God must and can
satisfice by selecting a world that is surpassable, but <em>good
enough</em>. What sorts of worlds are good enough? Those which are:
&ldquo;non-disappointing in the light of the values that underlie the
ranking of worlds, and moreover &hellip; abundantly better than those
worlds that only just barely escape the accusation that they are
disappointing&rdquo;
 (81).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On Langtry&rsquo;s view, God cannot choose a world that fails to be
<em>good enough</em>. If alternate possibilities are required for
freedom, then God cannot be said to freely choose a <em>good
enough</em> world in lieu of a non-good-enough world. If, as Langtry
suggests, God can choose <em>any</em> of the good enough worlds, and
again, if alternate possibilities are required for freedom, then God
can be said to freely choose a good enough world in lieu of all the
other good enough worlds. On models of divine freedom that prioritize
lack of external constraint, reasons-responsiveness, and ultimate
sourcehood, it seems that God can be deemed free in both senses: God
freely selects a good enough world in lieu of a non-good-enough world,
and God freely selects one good enough world in lieu of all the other
good enough worlds. (Of course, this solution will only work if divine
satisficing is defensible, and as noted above, this has been
contested.)</p>

<p>
Finally, it&rsquo;s worth noting that a version of the problem of
modal collapse also arises for any model on which God partitions the
set of possible worlds into those that are good enough and those which
are not. Given theism, if God cannot choose a world below the
threshold, then it seems that all the worlds below it are not genuine
possibilities after all: God&rsquo;s &lsquo;modal footprint&rsquo;
precludes them entirely. And, of course, one might hold that this
unacceptably violates our modal intuitions to the contrary.</p>

<h3 id="DivFreAppThaPraWorGod">2.6 Divine Freedom and the Appropriateness of Thanking, Praising, and Worshipping God.</h3>

<p>
God&rsquo;s actions are typically thought worthy of thanks and praise
only if they are free. If this is correct, then any plausible model of
divine freedom supplies a necessary condition for an account of the
appropriateness of thanking and praising God for his actions.
Moreover, this can also ground an account of the appropriateness of
worshiping God, since worship typically involves giving thanks and
offering praise for God&rsquo;s actions. On the other hand, any
argument against divine freedom can likewise be extended to target the
propriety or intelligibility of thanking God and praising God&rsquo;s
actions &ndash; and, by extension, the propriety or intelligibility of
worshipping God.</p>

<p>
Some authors think that the freedom needed for thanks and praise
involves the availability of alternate possibilities. Rowe, for
example, thinks that &ldquo;non-libertarian notions of freedom in
which God may be said to be free &hellip; are insufficient to support
our being thankful and grateful to God&rdquo; (2004,
 7),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 and Frances Howard-Snyder says that &ldquo;[i]f an agent is worthy of
thanks and praise &ndash; as God surely is &ndash; then he could have
acted differently&rdquo; (2017,
 656).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 But of course, defenders of rival models of divine freedom can hold
that their models satisfy the necessary condition for judging
God&rsquo;s actions worthy of thanks or
 praise.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It&rsquo;s important to note that God can be thought praiseworthy, or
worthy of worship, quite apart from his actions. (See, for example,
Swinburne 1977, 292; Rogers 2008, 195&ndash;6; Franks 2015, 108).
Moreover, Senor explicitly holds that, given this, God can sensibly be
praised <em>for who he is</em> even if God is not free.</p>

<blockquote>
What makes God praiseworthy is God&rsquo;s power together with
God&rsquo;s nature as fair, merciful, and loving &ndash; God&rsquo;s
embodying all that is valuable. God&rsquo;s nature as both the source
of all that is and as a benevolent Creator is what makes God worthy of
our praise. This sense of praiseworthiness does depend on God&rsquo;s
naturally treating us a certain way, but it does not depend on God's
<em>freely</em> treating us that way
 (185).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Senor also holds that God can sensibly be <em>thanked</em> for his
actions, even if they are unfree. He imagines the case of a benevolent
aunt who frequently sends generous gifts out of concern for your
well-being, but who is &ldquo;not really able to resist&rdquo; doing
so, given her upbringing and strong religious convictions (186). Senor
thinks that it is nevertheless be entirely appropriate &ndash; and
indeed your duty &ndash; to thank your aunt. Likewise, Senor thinks,
it is entirely proper to thank God for what God has done, even if it
was not done freely. While Senor&rsquo;s analogy of the benevolent
aunt appears to invoke a conception of freedom that requires alternate
possibilities, he seems to hold that it can be appropriate to thank
God for what he has done even if God is unfree on other models of
freedom. The bottom line, for Senor, seems to be that thanks are due
whenever benefits are intentionally bestowed, whether or not they are
bestowed freely.</p>

<h3 id="DivFreArgForAgaThe">2.7 Divine Freedom and Arguments For and Against Theism</h3>

<p>
There are, of course, many arguments for and against the existence of
God. This section sets out some important connections between some of
these arguments and divine freedom. Some of these were mentioned
above; others were not.</p>

<p>
Some arguments for the non-existence of God seek to show that some
divine attribute that is plausibly thought essential is incoherent, or
else that it cannot be exemplified by God. Freedom is generally
thought to be an essential attribute of God, so it if can be shown
that this attribute is incoherent, or that it cannot be exemplified by
God, then this, in turn, shows that God does not exist. The models of
divine freedom set out in sections 1.1&ndash;1.4 can be understood as
ways to defend the claim that divine freedom is coherent, or that God
can properly be thought free &ndash; and as such, they can be deployed
in response to such arguments.</p>

<p>
Other arguments for the non-existence of God seek to show that there
is a logical conflict between two or more divine attributes that are
plausibly thought essential. For example, some philosophers have
argued that there is a conflict between omnipotence and moral
perfection, if these are both held to be essential attributes. This
was discussed in section 2.1, together with various responses &ndash;
and their implications for divine freedom.</p>

<p>
Philosophers have long discussed whether divine foreknowledge
threatens human freedom. (See the entry on
 <a href="../free-will-foreknowledge/">foreknowledge and free will</a>.)
 Although it has seen surprisingly little discussion, a parallel issue
arises for divine foreknowledge: if God infallibly foreknows what he
will do at some future time, can his action at that time be deemed
free? If not, then there is a conflict between omniscience and
<em>divine</em> freedom &ndash; and this can also motivate an argument
against any conception of theism that takes both of these to be
essential attributes of God. Richard Swinburne (1977, 175ff) accepts
that foreknowledge conflicts with divine freedom, but since he aims to
defend the coherence of theism, he holds that God voluntarily limits
his knowledge in order to preserve his freedom. Swinburne insists
that, despite this self-limitation, God can nevertheless know what
will happen in the future whenever these events are determined by past
states of the universe and the laws of nature. But Michael Martin
objects that God cannot know even this, since God &ndash; on
Swinburne&rsquo;s account &ndash; cannot foreknow whether he will
intervene in the natural order (1990, 298). Accordingly, Martin
thinks, even on Swinburne&rsquo;s attenuated conception of
omniscience, there remains a conflict between this attribute and
divine freedom. Martin also argues that on Swinburne&rsquo;s
conception of omniscience, God cannot know the long-term consequences
of his own free actions. Moreover, he continues, God cannot know the
overall moral status of his free actions, since this is determined (at
least in part) by their consequences (300&ndash;1). Accordingly,
Martin thinks he has identified a further conflict between divine
freedom and (attenuated) omniscience. (For further criticisms of
Swinburne, see Fouts 1993).</p>

<p>
Other arguments for atheism hold that there is a conflict between some
claim(s) about God and some claim(s) about modal space. In sections
2.2, 2.3, and 2.5, we looked at three rival models of modal space. As
we saw, it has been claimed that each of these models conflicts with
divine freedom. If there is exactly one unsurpassable world, it has
been held that God cannot be free with respect to choosing it. If
there are multiple unsurpassable worlds, this has been thought to
threaten divine freedom in two ways: (a) some have held that God
cannot freely choose an unsurpassable world in lieu of a surpassable
one; and (b) some have held that God&rsquo;s choice of one
unsurpassable world in lieu of all the other unsurpassable ones cannot
be deemed free. Finally, if <em>every</em> world is surpassable, it
has been held that God cannot be free. These, then, are all arguments
for the incompatibility between divine freedom and some model of modal
space. As we saw, defenders of theism have responded in various ways.
(Also, as we saw in section 2.4, the intuition that modal space
contains surpassable worlds has been held to count against
theism.)</p>

<p>
Still other arguments for atheism hold that there is a conflict
between some claim(s) about God and some feature(s) of the actual
world. Arguments from evil take this form. (See the entry on the
 <a href="../evil/">problem of evil</a>.)
 As noted in section 1.1, an important response to such arguments
invokes the value of libertarian free will for human beings. And this,
in turn, has led some philosophers to think that God must have
libertarian free will too.</p>

<p>
Finally, here are two connections between divine freedom and arguments
<em>for</em> God&rsquo;s existence. Ontological arguments for
God&rsquo;s existence typically involve a conception of God as the
greatest conceivable, or greatest possible, being &ndash; and this
notion is often held to include essential moral perfection (See Flint
1983, Morriston 1985, and Guleserian 1985.) But as we saw in section
2.1, essential moral perfection has been thought to conflict with
divine freedom. Second, Kremers (2024) argues that certain <em>a
posteriori</em> arguments for God&rsquo;s existence, such as moral
arguments and fine-tuning arguments, are more plausible if God
<em>lacks</em> the power to refrain from creating anything contingent
than if God is thought to have this power. If this is correct, and if
God&rsquo;s <em>having</em> this power is required for freedom, then
these arguments&rsquo; plausibility is purchased at the expense of
divine freedom.</p>
