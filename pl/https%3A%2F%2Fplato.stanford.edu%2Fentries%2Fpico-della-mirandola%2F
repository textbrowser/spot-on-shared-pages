<h1>Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jun 3, 2008; substantive revision Wed Aug 21, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
A few paragraphs from a speech that Giovanni Pico (1463&ndash;1494)
did not write about human dignity have drawn more comment than any
other statement by a philosopher of his day. No philosophers of
post-medieval, pre-Cartesian Europe are better known now than the
prince and his contemporaries, Erasmus (b. 1466), Machiavelli (b.
1469) and Thomas More (b. 1478). Unlike them, he was fully committed
to <em>philosophia</em>, as he understood it, and he was remarkably
original&mdash;indeed, idiosyncratic. His persistently esoteric and
aggressively recondite manner helps explain why the period identified
with him&mdash;the Renaissance&mdash;has had so little attention in
the canonical history of the discipline as presented today in
Anglophonia, where aims, assumptions and attitudes of philosophers are
so different.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>
Pico was born on 24 February 1463, to a noble Italian family, the
counts of Mirandola and Concordia near Modena in the Emilia-Romagna
north of Tuscany. Around the age of 14 he enrolled at Bologna to study
church law, but within two years he put his lawbooks away and moved to
Ferrara, then shortly afterward to Padua, where he met and studied
with Elia del Medigo, a Jew and an Averroist Aristotelian. By the time
he left Padua in 1482, he had felt the contrary attraction of the
Platonism that Marsilio Ficino was reviving in Florence. By 1484 he
was writing letters to other Florentine luminaries, Angelo Poliziano
and Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici.</p>

<p>
In 1485 the prince traveled to Paris, where aftershocks of conflict
between nominalists and realists were still shaking this citadel of
Aristotelian scholasticism. At the age of 22, before leaving Italy, he
had already presented himself as a philosopher&mdash;by defending the
technical terminology that since Petrarch&rsquo;s time had incited
philological critics to attack philosophical Latin as a barbaric
breach of classical norms. Having refined his literary talent while
adding new skills in philosophy, Pico issued this manifesto as a
letter to Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Venetian scholar. He used the
occasion and the genre to show, like Plato in the <em>Phaedrus</em>,
how rhetoric could arm philosophy against rhetorical assault.</p>

<p>
After a short stay in Paris, Pico returned to Florence and then
Arezzo, where he caused a ruckus by abducting a young woman already
married to Giuliano Mariotto de&rsquo; Medici. Support came from
Lorenzo, a more formidable Medici cousin, but the commotion and then a
plague kept the young lord on the move. By this time, while writing a
<em>Commento</em> in Italian on a friend&rsquo;s love poem, he already
had plans for a more ambitious project: to bind up philosophy&rsquo;s
sectarian wounds. He started with harmony (<em>concordia</em>) that he
saw beneath the surface of conflict between Platonists and
Aristotelians. His peacemaking soon became global, aiming for a single
symphony of ideas that would harmonize all schools of thought, past
and present.</p>

<p>
To call attention to this hopeless enterprise, Pico decided to
underwrite a magnificent conference in Rome early in 1487. In
preparation he assembled 900 propositions from dozens of
authorities&mdash;ancient and medieval, pagan and Christian, Muslim,
and Jewish&mdash;and challenged all comers to debate them in public.
He had these <em>Conclusions</em> printed in Rome at the end of 1486,
and to introduce them he composed a speech that he never gave or had
published. After he died in 1494, others mistakenly called this
address an <em>Oration on the Dignity of Man</em>: Pico never gave it
a title.</p>

<p>
Intervention by the Holy See derailed Pico&rsquo;s plans and blocked
the conference. Innocent VIII indicted 13 of the 900 theses and
appointed a commission that soon declared 6 of them suspect and
condemned 7 others. The defendant&rsquo;s hasty response was an
<em>Apology</em> that provoked Innocent to denounce the whole
collection of 900 propositions. The prince, dishonored and in danger,
left Italy for France again, but authorities there detained him at the
pope&rsquo;s request and jailed him briefly. By the summer of 1488 he
was back in Tuscany as Lorenzo&rsquo;s guest, and in 1489 he dedicated
his <em>Heptaplus</em> to his benefactor, describing it as a
<em>Sevenfold Account of the Six Days of Genesis</em>. Lorenzo&rsquo;s
protection gave his escapades better cover than his own considerable
resources could provide. Since 1483 he had a third of the income from
his family&rsquo;s estates, which along with his Mirandola property he
transferred in 1491 to his nephew Gianfrancesco. This other Pico,
younger by a few years, became an influential philosopher in his own
right&mdash;an early voice for reviving scepticism as an instrument of
Christian faith.</p>

<p>
During this period, as memories of the disastrous <em>Conclusions</em>
faded, people still worried about the elder Pico&rsquo;s orthodoxy.
The Kabbalist exegesis of the Bible in the
<em>Heptaplus</em>&mdash;tame by the author&rsquo;s earlier
standards&mdash;was not understated enough to resolve all doubts.
Philological conversation with Poliziano was less risky, however, and
produced a fragment <em>On Being and the One</em> after 1490. Pico
told Poliziano that he envisioned <em>De ente et uno</em> as the first
installment of a great work that would find Platonism beneath the
surface of Aristotle&rsquo;s thinking:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
those who alienate Aristotle from Plato also alienate themselves from
me, for I hold that their views are in harmony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Not everyone was pleased by the harmonizing&mdash;least of all Antonio
Cittadini, a professor at Pisa who was still fighting Gianfrancesco
about it two years after his uncle&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>
In 1493 Giovanni achieved reconciliation with a higher authority when
Pope Alexander VI pardoned his earlier misadventures. By this time,
the prince and his nephew were in the orbit of Girolamo Savonarola,
the fiery Dominican who had been elected Prior at the Convent of San
Marco, a Florentine landmark. Pico had already known the oracular
friar before his sermons persuaded the city to try his theocratic
rules. Mesmerized by Savonarola and ever more pious, he gave more
properties away, some to the Church and some to his family, as his
needs became less worldly. When death took him on 17 November
1494&mdash;by poison, some said, where rumors of poisoning were like
complaints about runny noses&mdash;Florence fell on the same day to
French armies. The turmoil of invasion ended the city&rsquo;s age of
glory, illuminated by Pico&rsquo;s genius&mdash;though only
intermittently. Ficino, his older friend, occasional rival and a
steadier soul, survived him by five years.</p>

<h2 id="WorkRepu">2. Works and Reputation</h2>

<p>
Pico&rsquo;s major works were the <em>900 Conclusions</em> in 1486,
the <em>Oration</em> written to introduce it, the <em>Apology</em>
that defended the <em>Conclusions</em> in 1487, the <em>Heptaplus</em>
in 1489 and the <em>Disputations against Predictive Astrology</em>,
left unfinished when he died in 1494, without ever making the
<em>Oration</em> public.</p>

<h3 id="ConcOrat">2.1 <em>Conclusions</em> and <em>Oration</em></h3>

<p>
Pico&rsquo;s modern fame rests on a speech about the dignity of man
that he never gave and that got its title after he died. His public
debut was the <em>900 Conclusions</em>, printed without a title near
the end of 1486. It was more like a pamphlet than a book, just three
dozen sheets of paper and three dozen lists of unsupported statements.
These 900 propositions, less than 20 words each, were the only
messages sent by the 17,000 words of Pico&rsquo;s booklet. He called
them &lsquo;conclusions&rsquo;, but he gave them no backing, and some
were outrageous theological novelties&mdash;including the claim that
magic and Kabbalah proved Christ&rsquo;s divinity. He wrote this
proposition, like all the others, in preparation for the debate that
he planned to stage in Rome, the capital of Christendom. His flimsy
little handout, crudely printed, was also a script and an
advertisement. The prince expected to draw a crowd. Instead he drew
down the wrath of God through his Vicar on earth, Pope Innocent. Legal
proceedings against the <em>Conclusions</em> started. Planning for a
disputational spectacle stopped. Years of disgrace and danger began
for Pico and his first public work.</p>

<p>
He divided the pamphlet into two parts: the first had 402 theses; the
second had 498 theses. He took credit and assumed responsibility only
for the second part, having listed propositions in the first part
under names of other persons and groups of persons who were eminent in
philosophy, theology and theosophy. This was the layout of the first
part:</p>

<ol style="-webkit-columns: 2; -moz-columns: 2; columns:2">

<li>Albert the Great</li>

<li>Aquinas</li>

<li>Fran&ccedil;ois de Meyronnes</li>

<li>Scotus</li>

<li>Henry of Ghent</li>

<li>Egidio Romano</li>

<li>Ibn Rushd</li>

<li>Ibn Sina</li>

<li>Al-Farabi</li>

<li>Isaac Albalag</li>

<li>Ibn Marwan</li>

<li>Maimonides</li>

<li>Tolletinus</li>

<li>Ibn Bajja</li>

<li>Theophrastus</li>

<li>Ammonius</li>

<li>Simplicius</li>

<li>Alexander</li>

<li>Themistius</li>

<li>Plotinus</li>

<li>Adeland</li>

<li>Porphyry</li>

<li>Iamblichus</li>

<li>Proclus</li>

<li>Pythagoreans</li>

<li>Chaldeans</li>

<li>Egyptians</li>

<li>Kabbalist Jews</li>
</ol>

<p>
And this was the second part, where Pico highlighted his own ambitions
more than older authorities:</p>

<ol style="-webkit-columns: 2; -moz-columns: 2; columns:2">

<li>Concord</li>

<li>Dissent</li>

<li>Novelty</li>

<li>Deviance</li>

<li>Platonism</li>

<li>Causes</li>

<li>Numbers</li>

<li>Chaldeans</li>

<li>Magic</li>

<li>Orphica</li>

<li>Christian Kabbalah</li>
</ol>

<p>
All this was in print before the pope stopped the rash project. To
make matters worse, the prince defended his blunder in a recalcitrant
<em>Apology</em> whose preface was part of the still unpublished
<em>Oration</em>&mdash;though not the part that later became famous.
Pico&rsquo;s words in the <em>Conclusions</em> were deeds, and they
were reckless. His propositions were performative speech-acts, eristic
and illocutionary, not just declarative and endoxic or apodictic.
Theatrical combat continued throughout the booklet, despite
eye-catching claims about <em>concordia</em> that introduced the
second part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is no inquiry, natural or theological, where Aristotle and Plato
don&rsquo;t agree in meaning and content (<em>sensu et re</em>) even
though they seem to disagree in words (<em>verbis</em>). [Pico,
<em>Conclusiones</em>, 1486, 28]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Pico detected philosophical harmony not only in Aristotle versus Plato
but also in Ibn Sina versus Ibn Rushd, Aquinas versus Scotus, and
other notorious quarrels. He meant his proclamation of concord to be
startling. He called it &lsquo;contrarian&rsquo; (<em>paradoxus</em>),
but it wasn&rsquo;t original: ancient commentators on Plato and
Aristotle had the same view. Simplicius of Cilicia, a Platonist of the
sixth century known to Pico, had written that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a worthwhile interpreter of Aristotle&rsquo;s writings &hellip; should
examine not just the language (&lambda;&#941;&xi;&iota;&nu;) of what
he says against Plato &hellip; but look also at the meaning
(&nu;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;) and search out the harmony
(&sigma;&upsilon;&mu;&phi;&omega;&nu;&#943;&alpha;&nu;) between them
on most matters. [Simpl. <em>In Cat.</em> 7.23&ndash;32, translation
by the author of this entry]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Pico chose propositions because he could defend or attack them
convincingly, and he stated them in forms that would optimize his
advantages&mdash;logical and philosophical but also rhetorical. In
this disputatious framework, a thesis <em>secundum Thomam</em>,
<em>secundum Averroem</em> or <em>secundum Proclum</em> might or might
not have been a fair statement of anyone&rsquo;s
position&mdash;including Pico&rsquo;s. Fidelity in presentation was
not the prince&rsquo;s aim; his aim was victory in debate.</p>

<p>
The first part of his book attached its conclusions to names of
authorities: Aquinas, Ibn Rushd, Proclus, and two dozen others.
Readers who saw works by these sages as sources of Pico&rsquo;s theses
were sometimes correct: thinkers named by him had indeed stated some
of his conclusions verbatim or nearly so. But words printed under
their names seldom presented their teachings clearly, often altered
them and sometimes could not have been theirs because of anachronisms
or incompatibilities: Pico&rsquo;s many presentations of authority in
the first part of the <em>Conclusions</em> did not simply follow the
views of these authors&mdash;or his own. The excessive brevity of his
propositions, constricted by reflexive secrecy, made it hard to
diagnose his intentions or follow his trains of thought.</p>

<p>
Most propositions in the <em>Conclusions</em> were scholastic
theology; many others were Kabbalah; together this was two-thirds of
the book. Kabbalah was unintelligible to Christian theologians, just
as their theology horrified the few learned Jews who had studied
Kabbalah. The Platonism of late antiquity, from Plotinus through
Proclus and his followers, dominated the other third of the book.
Ficino had set a high standard for Pico&rsquo;s Platonic propositions,
not just the philosophy but also the philology. It&rsquo;s safe to
say, all in all, that there wasn&rsquo;t much competent readership in
Italy for the prince&rsquo;s book at the time it was published. Some
individuals might have understood it, but not many.</p>

<p>
The few Christians whose education had prepared them for Greek texts
on Neoplatonic metaphysics&mdash;unusual people like Barbaro, Ficino
and Poliziano&mdash;were developing a new way to read, write, talk and
teach, grounded in a philology of ancient languages, that came to be
called &lsquo;humanism&rsquo;&mdash;though not until the nineteenth
century. Meanwhile, four centuries earlier, there was nothing
&lsquo;humanist&rsquo; about Pico&rsquo;s <em>Conclusions</em>, whose
content, milieu and presentation were thoroughly medieval. On the
Latin Christian side, his authorities had flourished in the thirteenth
and early fourteenth centuries. On the Arabic, Aramaic, Hebrew,
Jewish, and Muslim side, his texts were earlier, in place before the
thirteenth century ended. For Greek thought his mainstay was Proclus
from the fifth century.</p>

<p>
Only three traditions were prominent in the <em>Conclusions</em>:
Kabbalist, Peripatetic, and Platonic. Pico&rsquo;s Platonism, centered
on Proclus and his followers, was post-Hellenistic and medieval, not
Hellenic. &lsquo;Peripatetic&rsquo; was his label for the scholastic
Aristotelianism&mdash;Jewish and Muslim as well as
Christian&mdash;that peaked in the thirteenth century. He explained in
the <em>Oration</em> that &lsquo;Kabbalah&rsquo; was &ldquo;the Hebrew
word for our &lsquo;reception&rsquo;&rdquo;. A related word,
&lsquo;tradition&rsquo;, would have done just as well. As for a
tradition called &lsquo;Hermetic&rsquo;, the <em>Conclusions</em> had
nothing good to say. Imitating Proclus, Pico preferred Chaldean
prophets and Orphic bards to the Egyptian Hermes.</p>

<p>
The prince was so well informed about celebrated
Peripatetics&mdash;Aquinas, Farabi, Giles of Rome, Henry of Ghent, Ibn
Rushd, Ibn Sina, Maimonides, Scotus, and others&mdash;that he spotted
flaws in their theology and tried to fix them with Platonic
metaphysics. His main informant about mistakes made by Christians was
Jean Cabrol (Capreolus, d. 1443), a Dominican explicator of Aquinas.
Pico owned Cabrol&rsquo;s huge commentary in an incunable edition of
1483. By that time Cabrol&rsquo;s Dominican followers had given his
work a militant new title, <em>Defensiones</em>, treating it as a
manual for Thomism on the attack. Cabrol&rsquo;s defense of Thomas
instructed Pico about the <em>opposition</em> to Thomism, showing him
how to express Averroist and nominalist objections to the <em>communis
via</em>&mdash;his term for the rigidified Thomist consensus.
Statements in the <em>Conclusions</em> showed contempt for teachings
endorsed by Aquinas. Propositions that insulted the saint by name were
among those condemned.</p>

<p>
Elia del Medigo surveyed Pico&rsquo;s path through quarrels about and
among Muslims. This learned Jew from Crete introduced him to a Jewish
commentary tradition on Ibn Rushd, both in Hebrew and in Arabic. Just
as Pico learned how to oppose Thomism from Cabrol, a doctrinaire
Thomist, he also learned how to refute criticisms of Averroism from
Elia, a zealous Averroist. Philosophers attacked by Ibn
Rushd&mdash;Farabi, Ibn Bajja, Ibn Sina, and others&mdash;were
vulnerable voices in Pico&rsquo;s theses, along with Aquinas,
Albertus, and Scotus, also Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, and the
Greek commentators.</p>

<p>
The <em>Conclusions</em> were, among other things, Pico&rsquo;s
egregious advertisement of his own learning&mdash;a polyglot catalog
of propositions that challenged orthodoxy and defied common opinion.
When he called some of these conclusions <em>paradoxae</em>, he
wasn&rsquo;t thinking of semantic puzzles like the Liar or of
Zeno&rsquo;s arresting tales. His model for contrarian propositions
was Cicero&rsquo;s account of Stoic paradoxes. These provocations,
labeled as such, were only a few dozen out of 900 statements, all of
them presented as quodlibetal theses like those debated in medieval
universities.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, the 900 theses in Pico&rsquo;s little book were more
inflammatory than the 7,000 words of his <em>Oration</em>: the oblique
oratory in the speech was conventional as rhetoric and entertaining in
its eloquence. Besides, the scandal of papal condemnation in 1487 was
old news by 1496, when Gianfrancesco first had the <em>Oration</em>
printed in a posthumous collection of his uncle&rsquo;s works
(<em>Commentationes</em>). Pico&rsquo;s nephew, also a philosopher,
was and still is the primary source for stories about his uncle.
Giovanni&rsquo;s silenced oratory embarrassed Gianfrancesco. He
recalled that his uncle regretted the speech as a juvenile mistake.
For the next several centuries, few of Pico&rsquo;s admirers
challenged this verdict, despite the orator&rsquo;s continuing fame.
Until the <em>Oration</em> charmed post-Kantian historians, it had few
readers. But <em>dignitas</em> got plenty of attention before Pico was
born</p>

<p>
Shortly after 1450, Giannozzo Manetti completed his <em>De dignitate
et excellentia hominis</em>. Unlike the <em>Oration</em>,
Manetti&rsquo;s book was actually about <em>dignitas</em>, but as
ancient Romans and medieval Christians used the word for
&lsquo;rank&rsquo;, &lsquo;status&rsquo;, &lsquo;value&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;worth&rsquo;&mdash;not good fits for what Kant would say about
<em>W&uuml;rde</em> as distinct from <em>Wert</em>. Manetti&rsquo;s
<em>dignitas</em> was essentially Christian but slightly secularized
by late medieval interest in ancient pagans like Cicero and by changed
conditions of life in fifteenth-century Italy. Manetti attacked a
twelfth-century treatise <em>On Human Misery</em> by Cardinal Lotario
dei Segni, who later became Pope Innocent III. Two contemporaries of
Manetti&mdash;Antonio da Barga and Bartolomeo Facio&mdash;had written
less impressively on his topic. These treatments of <em>dignitas</em>
were well known, but Pico&rsquo;s undelivered speech paid no attention
to them because <em>dignitas</em> was not his subject. His larger
project&mdash;advertised by the <em>Conclusions</em> but not well
presented&mdash;was to convince people that they could save their
souls by using magic and Kabbalah to change themselves into
angels.</p>

<p>
Awareness of the speech&mdash;unpublished in Pico&rsquo;s
lifetime&mdash;was erratic after he died. Bad publicity lingered from
the pope&rsquo;s denunciation of the <em>Conclusions</em>, which the
speech was meant to introduce. Except in the author&rsquo;s collected
works, the Latin text was printed only once before the 1940s, when the
first English translation also appeared, just after the first Italian
version in 1936. What readers had seen on the title page of the
<em>Commentationes</em> in 1496 was just <em>A Very Elegant
Oration</em>. By 1530&mdash;in the only separately published Latin
text of the pre-modern period&mdash;these words expanded into <em>On
Man by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</em>, <em>Explaining the Loftier
Mysteries of Sacred and Human Philosophy</em>. Meanwhile, the front
matter of the 5 collected editions or reprints between 1498 and 1521
stayed with the 1496 formulation, <em>Oratio quaedam
elegantissima</em>, which in 1557 finally became <em>On the Dignity of
Man</em> in a Basel collection and, in a Venice edition of the same
year, <em>A Very Elegant Oration on the High Nobility and Dignity of
Man</em>. The words <em>de dignitate hominis</em> had first described
the speech, less conspicuously, <em>inside</em> the 1504 edition.
Later in 1572 and 1601, two other collections used a new format that
no longer displayed contents by title at the front of the book.</p>

<h3 id="OtheWorkGianLife">2.2 Other Works and Gianfrancesco&rsquo;s <em>Life</em></h3>

<p>
The British Library Catalog, listing about 1300 books by Erasmus
printed before 1701, has about 100 contemporary entries for Pico.
During the same period, when Marsilio Ficino&rsquo;s <em>De vita libri
tres</em> went through more than 30 editions, Pico&rsquo;s
<em>Oratio</em>&mdash;far better known today than Ficino&rsquo;s
<em>Three Books on Life</em>&mdash;attracted few publishers. Of the
five dozen or so titles by the prince that were printed in this
period, about half were collections of letters: the first two, called
<em>Golden Letters</em>, were incunables. Letters also appeared in
early collections with Pico&rsquo;s other works: title pages named
Ficino and Poliziano as his correspondents, and all of them were
durable celebrities.</p>

<p>
Pico&rsquo;s letters succeeded commercially because of the
writer&rsquo;s fame and the needs of readers. Latin was still a medium
of learned communication in the late seventeenth century, when Isaac
Newton published his <em>Principia</em> in that undead language, and
educated people still learned to write by imitating stylists like
Pico. His epistolary Latin was elegant, and his fame had lasted. He
was renowned as a critic of astrology, as an expert on Kabbalah and as
the talented Count Pico&mdash;a Phoenix who blazed through a brief
life in the triple glare of an old aristocratic society, a new
mandarin culture of classical scholarship and, in his last years, the
apocalyptic carnival that raged in Savonarola&rsquo;s Florence. Noble
origins, fashionable friends, physical beauty, prodigious learning,
capacious memory, scholarly journeys, youthful sins, trouble with the
Church, eventual repentance, and a pious death: these were motifs of
the family hagiography by his nephew Gianfrancesco that kept Giovanni
Pico famous for being famous as the centuries passed.</p>

<p>
Because he died so young, the prince finished very little and
published less: he neither completed nor published the vernacular
<em>Commento</em>; the <em>Conclusions</em> were just bare statements
of theses; the preface in the rushed <em>Apology</em> was a piece of
the unpublished <em>Oration</em>; <em>On Being and the One</em>, also
unpublished, was left over from a plan to harmonize Plato and
Aristotle; and Gianfrancesco found the unfinished
<em>Disputations</em> bundled with his dead uncle&rsquo;s papers. The
only works that Giovanni sent to a printer while he lived were the
<em>Conclusions</em>, the <em>Apology</em>, and the
<em>Heptaplus</em>.</p>

<p>
The <em>Apology</em>, defending the <em>Conclusions</em> against
heresy charges, was Pico&rsquo;s longest piece of philosophical
writing. Mostly it was conventional scholasticism in the manner of
Aquinas, Ockham and Scotus. This imprudent book&mdash;extensively
informed by Cabrol&rsquo;s <em>Defenses</em> of Aquinas&mdash;also
relied on Durand de Saint-Pour&ccedil;ain, Henry of Ghent, Jean
Quidort, Robert Holcot, and a dozen lesser medieval masters. The
<em>Conclusions</em>, in most of its content and all of its
presentation, was also thoroughly scholastic. The fashionable
classicism of Barbaro and Poliziano made no impression on Pico&rsquo;s
first two printed works, which framed his living
reputation&mdash;except at home in the Emilia-Romagna and in Tuscany,
where people knew him personally. He wrote his two long letters on
poetry and philosophical language in the new classical Latin, but few
saw them while the writer lived: in later university settings, these
brilliant apprentice pieces would have been prize essays.</p>

<h3 id="ChriKabbHept">2.3 Christian Kabbalah and the <em>Heptaplus</em></h3>

<p>
Besides the <em>Conclusions</em> and the <em>Apology</em>, the only
project that Pico completed for publication in print was the
<em>Heptaplus</em> (1489), his Kabbalist commentary on the first 26
verses of Genesis. These lines presented the Account of the Beginning
(<em>Ma&lsquo;aseh Bereshit</em>), a favorite of Menahem Recanati,
Abraham Abulafia, and other Kabbalists known to Pico through learned
Italian Jews, especially Flavius Mithridates, Elia del Medigo, and
Yohanan Alemanno. They gave him ingredients for a Christianized
Kabbalah, a Jewish complement to Ficino&rsquo;s ancient theology, and
he put it on display in the <em>900 Conclusions</em>: 119 of them,
including the final 72, were explicitly Kabbalist and outlandishly so
from a Christian point of view.</p>

<p>
While Pico tried half-heartedly to harmonize all of Europe&rsquo;s
philosophies, Christianizing Kabbalah was his main project. He found
Christology and trinitarian theology in an oral Torah confided to
Moses and passed on secretly through Esdras and other sages. Because
its origin was Mosaic, Kabbalah was more hallowed than the pagan
wisdom that Ficino had traced to Zoroaster and Hermes Trismegistus in
ancient Chaldea and Egypt, where Platonic philosophy supposedly had
its roots. Pico was the first Christian who had the
expertise&mdash;including a little Hebrew, Aramaic and possibly
Arabic&mdash;to make the astonishing claims that he published about
Kabbalah as the core of a holier ancient theology.</p>

<p>
Books of Kabbalah were being read by the twelfth century, but
Christians knew almost nothing about them before Pico. The Kabbalah
that he revealed to Latin Europe was a theory as well as a
practice&mdash;biblical hermeneutics with devotional intent. For some
Kabbalists, then as now, textual studies underwrote a spiritual
practice whose aim was mystical ascent and prophetic ecstasy achieved
by ritual techniques, including magic and theurgy. Kabbalists believed
that the Hidden God, the No-End, revealed himself not only in the
Bible but also through ten aspects, attributes or emanations, the
<em>sefirot</em> or &lsquo;numberings&rsquo; of God&rsquo;s myriad
faces. Personalized in myths, visualized in images and symbolized by
letters and numbers, the <em>sefirot</em> acted in theosophical dramas
that framed devotional practices. Names of God that resonated in
scripture were the other main focus of Kabbalah.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig1">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1:</span> <em>Sefirot</em> in the
Standard Array. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig1">extended description of figure 1</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The Bible&rsquo;s Hebrew text was God&rsquo;s speech, infinite in
meaning. Kabbalists took their bearings even from its smallest
particles&mdash;not only the sacred words but also their letters
(which were also numbers) and even the shapes of letters. God&rsquo;s
names were the most potent words; the holiest of them, the
Tetragrammaton, could not be spoken. Written as
&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (yhwh), the unutterable Name was read
aloud as <em>Adonai</em>, a speakable name like <em>Elohim</em>,
<em>Ehyeh</em>, <em>El Shaddai</em>, and others used of God in the
Hebrew Bible. Names of the <em>sefirot</em>, unknown as such to
scripture, were also words of power. They were names not of God,
however, but of God&rsquo;s manifestations, some more remote than
others.</p>

<p>
The Creator stayed hidden in his highest essence. Creatures below
cognized the No-End only in descent from his secret heights. His
lowest downward moments filled the world of human awareness with
perceptible creatures. The first moments, far beyond the reach of
ordinary cognition, were the ten <em>sefirot</em>. Much of the
literature of Kabbalah described these numberings as shown in
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>:
 there were ten of them, <em>S1</em> through <em>S10</em>, and fruit
on the branches of this tree had many names. Common designations of
<em>S4</em>, for example, were <em>Gedullah</em> and <em>Hesed</em>,
meaning Greatness and Love or Piety, Latinized as <em>Amor</em> or
<em>Pietas</em> by Pico&rsquo;s instructors in Kabbalah. A divine name
associated with <em>S4</em> was <em>El</em>, but Kabbalists used many
other words and names (Abraham, Michael, the South, Water) to describe
<em>S4</em> and other <em>sefirot</em>: Pico&rsquo;s term was
<em>numerationes</em>, which he learned from his main informant, the
learned Jew and clever forger who called himself Flavius
Mithridates.</p>

<p>
Pico was the first Christian who described Kabbalah in detail or
treated it as worthwhile, hoping to persuade other Christians that
this Jewish mysticism could help save their souls. Flavius, his
prolific helper and deceiver, translated and mistranslated thousands
of pages of Kabbalah from Aramaic and Hebrew into Latin. To make his
work pleasing to Pico, Flavius added words and phrases&mdash;not found
in the originals&mdash;that carried Christian messages. This convert
to Christianity was a talented linguist who had worked at the Vatican.
His translations were <em>almost</em> entirely sound; otherwise, the
faking would have been obvious.</p>

<p>
Portions of the <em>Oration</em>, drawing on this tainted material,
were informed by Kabbalah in ways that no contemporary Christian could
have noticed&mdash;especially if they lacked clues provided by more
than a hundred theses in the <em>Conclusions</em>. Pico&rsquo;s
esoteric intentions, proclaimed emphatically in the unpublished
<em>Oration</em> and publicized by impenetrable propositions in the
<em>Conclusions</em>, distanced his project not only from
post-Cartesian philosophies in Anglophonia and elsewhere but also from
earlier European systems outside the Platonic tradition. Wishing not
just to mystify but also to provoke, Pico succeeded and paid the price
of his Church&rsquo;s anger.</p>

<p>
Theology, spirituality and philosophy&mdash;all in the broadest
sense&mdash;were the main content of Pico&rsquo;s Kabbalah, which
showed (or hinted) how God revealed himself in the <em>sefirot</em>,
in divine names and in words of scripture. In 72 Kabbalist theses at
the finale of the <em>Conclusions</em>, this revelation became
Christology and trinitarian theology. From a Kabbalist point of view,
the <em>sefirot</em> and the divine names were characters in stories
about theology, cosmology, anthropology and angelology; major themes
were exile, death, atonement and redemption, tales told by Jews that
Pico applied to the Trinity, with Jesus as the messianic hero of a new
theosophy and the focus of a liturgy strange to Christians.</p>

<p>
Devotions advocated by the <em>Conclusions</em> were prayer and ritual
as preparations for ecstasy and ascent to mystical union with God.
This practical theosophy was also the main message of the
<em>Oration</em>, where Pico&rsquo;s ladder up to divinity had rungs
of magic and theurgy. Propositions in the <em>Conclusions</em>
confirmed this endorsement of magic and showed in more detail than the
speech why Pico linked magic with Kabbalah. He saw the combination as
a pious practice which&mdash;like the higher theurgy of Iamblichus and
other Platonic philosophers&mdash;explored routes to God that were
usually hidden. The practice of Kabbalah started with theory because
these channels, concealed in scripture, had to be disclosed and
interpreted before anyone could reconnoiter them: spiritual progress
relied on hermeneutics.</p>

<p>
Kabbalist exegesis was the most obscure material in the
<em>Conclusions</em>, especially Pico&rsquo;s accounts of Hebrew words
and letters. Language was his gateway to wisdom, and elements of
language were letters and numbers that proliferated in secret codes.
Pico&rsquo;s genius and ambition, which the Church deplored as
impudence, attracted him to this challenge, a cryptic theology of the
hidden word, whose enigmas and ambiguities fed his hunger for the
esoteric. The Kabbalist theology in the <em>Conclusions</em>, hence
the Kabbalah promoted by the <em>Oration</em>, was deliberately
mystifying but finally Christological and trinitarian. Prior
exhibitions of Kabbalah in support of Pico&rsquo;s grand theory
focused on particular biblical texts, whose messages he also excavated
from the gentile wisdom of ancient theologians&mdash;Orpheus,
Pythagoras, Zoroaster and Chaldean prophets, though not the Egyptian
Hermes.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Heptaplus</em> of 1489 readers now recognize the Kabbalist
voice of the <em>Conclusions</em>: Pico&rsquo;s earlier works since
the <em>Commento</em> of 1485 have prepared them to hear it. These
impetuous texts advertised Kabbalah brazenly, unlike the cautious
<em>Heptaplus</em>, and they damaged Pico with enemies in Rome more
than they helped him with friends in Florence&mdash;Ficino, Poliziano
and others. Roberto Salviati, a learned Florentine friend of the
prince, called the <em>Heptaplus</em> &ldquo;the first fruits of his
studies&rdquo; when he arranged to have it printed [Pico, <em>De
hominis dignitate, Heptaplus</em> (<a href="#bb10">10</a>), 168]. Was
Salviati embarrassed by earlier works&mdash;the <em>Commento</em>,
<em>Conclusions</em>, and <em>Apology</em>? It&rsquo;s likelier that
he thought them forgettable than that he knew nothing about them. But
simple ignorance explains silence about the unpublished
<em>Oration</em>: Pico&rsquo;s nephew testified that even his uncle
kept quiet about it. Readers disturbed by the Kabbalah in the
<em>Conclusions</em> reacted predictably, but the <em>Heptaplus</em>
was less threatening because the author had sanitized it. After nearly
20 years, Crofton Black&rsquo;s book (2006) is still the best account
of the <em>Heptaplus</em>.</p>

<p>
Although the creation narrative was the topic of Patristic
commentaries by Ambrose and Basil of Caesarea, the first verses of
Genesis, examined in the <em>Heptaplus</em>, interested fewer
Christian interpreters than passages of Job or the Psalms. Like all
scripture, the opening of Genesis was thought to have three layers of
meaning&mdash;allegorical, tropological, and anagogical&mdash;beyond a
literal or &lsquo;historical&rsquo; sense: &ldquo;history talks about
events&rdquo;, according to the commentators,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
allegory about how one thing is understood from another, tropology
discusses morals, &hellip; and anagogy is the spiritual meaning
&hellip; that leads to higher things. [<em>Biblia latina cum glossa
ordinaria</em> (1480), Gen. prol. 1:6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the <em>Heptaplus</em> presented a new kind of allegory, a method
derived from the structure of creation itself and directed toward a
new type of anagogy, which was mystical ascent to the Godhead through
Kabbalah.</p>

<p>
Pico provided a key to this practical exegesis only in the last part
of the <em>Heptaplus</em>, which looked like an appendix tacked on at
the end&mdash;just another showing of virtuoso skill in biblical
languages. But to learned Jews of the day&mdash;Kabbalists or
not&mdash;Pico&rsquo;s analysis of the Hebrew letters of the first
word of Genesis (<em>Bereshit</em>, &ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo;)
would have seemed crude. There was nothing exotic in it except for
Christians, and for them the effect would have been
superficial&mdash;dazzling them with art.</p>

<p>
The arcane ending of the <em>Heptaplus</em> that looked extraneous was
actually a grand finale. Pico hinted at a secret that no Christian of
his day could have known: that Moses himself, whose words recorded the
creation story, had passed through 49 Gates of Understanding&mdash;7
&times; 7 sefirotic stations&mdash;on his way to a 50<sup>th</sup>
Gate, the supreme and final portal to union with God. The 49 prior
passages traversed vestibules of creation, demonstrating Pico&rsquo;s
allegorical method by exemplifying it: the universe of existence was
also a universe of understanding that showed a path to mystical union,
and the map was indeed the terrain.</p>

<p>
Without explaining the Gates, the <em>Conclusions</em> said enough
about them so that later scholars&mdash;Johann Reuchlin
especially&mdash;could find paths through Kabbalah and try to follow
them. Short and schematic directions, unlike Kabbalah in both ways,
would go like this: Wisdom, the second <em>sefirah</em> (<em>S2</em>
in
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>),
 built a palace in eternity for Intelligence at <em>S3</em> and carved
50 Gates there, 7 to be opened at each of the 7 lower
<em>sefirot</em>, <em>S4</em> through <em>S10</em>, leaving another
Gate beyond and still shut. The 50 Gates, also called the Jubilee,
corresponded to the 50-year festival ordained in Leviticus and also to
a Great Jubilee of 50,000 years, when 7 sabbatical cycles or weeks of
7,000 years came to an end. After a final age when the lower
<em>sefirot</em> collapsed into <em>S3</em>, the millenarian cycle
restarted, having been completed in the previous thousand
years&mdash;in the Sabbath of the Shekinah, God&rsquo;s Dwelling at
<em>S10</em>. This Sabbath, a 7th day of rest after 6 days of
creating, was Pico&rsquo;s ultimate allegory of mystical union, a
secret encoded not only in the letters of <em>Bereshit</em> but also
in the 7-fold structure of the <em>Heptaplus</em> itself.</p>

<p>
But who knew or could have known? In 1489, when Pico published the
<em>Heptaplus</em>, its only competent readers in Italy were a few
learned Jews who knew Latin&mdash;the very voices of Aramaic and
Hebrew who had told the prince enough about Kabbalah to load his
<em>Conclusions</em> with it. In most of the <em>Heptaplus</em>,
however, even where the book&rsquo;s structure and content plainly
depended on Kabbalah, Pico kept the mysteries hidden until the final
exposition of <em>Bereshit</em> that could only have baffled Christian
readers and scandalized them. As in earlier works, Pico intended to
mystify. He believed, and he said, that plain language would defile
the holiest wisdom. He uncovered God&rsquo;s secrets only for an elite
clever enough to unravel his allegories and break the ciphers that
concealed them. A salient fact and also a surprise&mdash;given
European and Anglophone conceptions of philosophy&mdash;is that Pico
thought of this mystification as philosophical and claimed
passionately to be a philosopher.</p>

<h3 id="OratButNotDign">2.4 Oratory but not Dignity</h3>

<p>
In the first few pages of the <em>Oration</em>&mdash;which eventually
confused more people in more languages than any other Latin text of
its time&mdash;the Creator tells Adam that he, alone of all creatures,
can make himself what he wants to be. This overture misled Wilhelm
Tennemann (1761&ndash;1819), a Kantian historian of philosophy: like
others after him, he treated Pico&rsquo;s stirring prelude as evidence
of a morality grounded, like Kant&rsquo;s, in human freedom and
dignity. This miscarried reading of the speech gathered strength from
the Enlightenment, acquired a romantic aura and in 1860 became
thematic for a new partition of cultural history, the Renaissance,
established by Jacob Burckhardt. Half a century later, Ernst
Cassirer&mdash;an eminent Neo-Kantian&mdash;authenticated the
<em>Oration</em> as a modern secular gospel. Nazis drove Cassirer and
Paul Kristeller, also a Kantian Jew, to North America, where they
brought Burckhardt&rsquo;s Renaissance and Pico&rsquo;s oratory to
thrive after World War II in college textbooks on &lsquo;Western
Civilization&rsquo;. Meanwhile, in Fascist Italy, just before
Mussolini&rsquo;s racial laws were enforced, Eugenio Garin had
published his foundational study of Pico (Garin 1937).</p>

<p>
The opening of the <em>Oration</em> is the most conspicuous part of
the speech, praised by Garin and others as a declaration of dignity,
freedom and &lsquo;humanism&rsquo;. Assured by initial statements that
we <em>can</em> be what we <em>want</em> to be, we are then
told&mdash;contrary to Garin&rsquo;s view and the usual
reading&mdash;that what we <em>ought</em> to be isn&rsquo;t human at
all. Our task is to become angels: <em>bodiless</em>, <em>sexless</em>
and ultimately&mdash;that most unromantic of all
conditions&mdash;<em>selfless</em> in the strictest sense. Living like
Cherubs, not quite the highest angels, was the first post-human peak
to be scaled. To go there, we must shed not only the gendered bodies
that imprison us but also identities and personalities that
distinguish every one of us from God and from everyone else. Personal
extinction by mystical union with God was Pico&rsquo;s goal: for
people to be divinized, selves had to be discarded. &ldquo;Let a
<em>holy</em> ambition possess our spirit&rdquo;, he wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
let us climb for the heights, panting; and let us strive with all our
might to reach them, since we can do it if we will it. Let us scorn
the things of earth, let us despise those of heaven, and then, leaving
behind whatever belongs to the world, let us fly up to the hypercosmic
court nearest the most exalted divinity&hellip;. As we emulate the
Cherubic life on earth, checking the impulses of the emotions through
moral knowledge, dispelling the darkness of reason through dialectic,
let us cleanse the soul by washing away the dirt of ignorance and vice
so that emotions will not rage in fury nor reason go mad and foolish.
Then let us flood the soul, purified and well tempered, with the light
of natural philosophy so that finally we may perfect it with knowledge
of divinity&hellip;. [Then] we will fully enjoy the peace that we have
longed for&mdash;the holiest peace, the unbreakable bond, <em>the
friendship of the single-souled wherein all our spirits do not so much
converge in the one mind above every mind as in some unsayable way
emerge as absolutely one</em>. This is that friendship which the
Pythagoreans say is the end of all philosophy. This is that peace
which God gives on high and angels descending to earth have announced
to men of good will so that through this peace these same men,
ascending to heaven, might be made into angels&hellip;. Ever forgetful
of herself, [the soul] will wish <em>to die in herself that she might
live in her spouse</em>, in whose sight the death of his saints is
most precious&mdash;death, I say, if one should use the word
&lsquo;death&rsquo; for that fullness of life whose contemplation the
sages have said is the aim of philosophy&hellip;. Lifted now to the
topmost height of her watchtower, for all eternity looking out without
interruption over what is, what will be and what has been, we shall
sing prophecies like Phoebus, and, gazing up at primeval beauty, we
shall be its winged lovers, until at last, with a love that cannot be
described, driven wild by desire and transported beyond ourselves like
burning Seraphs, full of divine power, <em>we shall be ourselves no
longer, but shall be Him</em>, the very one who made us. [Pico,
<em>Oration</em>, (<a href="#bb39">39</a>), 88&ndash;102]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the lowest level of this self-annihilating <em>paideia</em>, the
initiate began as a student of philosophy, learning ethics, logic,
natural philosophy and theology and then ascending, through arcana of
magic and Kabbalah, to drown the self in God&rsquo;s bottomless lake.
This was not a Kantian project, and the <em>Oration on the Dignity of
Man</em> that located the human condition in freedom and dignity was
written&mdash;and still is being written&mdash;by us post-Kantians,
not by Giovanni Pico.</p>

<p>
The outline of the <em>Oration</em> below was also not Pico&rsquo;s.
Its 7 parts may or may not have been his plan. But the deep structure
of the <em>Conclusions</em> was numerological, and the
<em>Heptaplus</em>, by its title and organization, showed that 7 was a
special number for the prince&mdash;as for so many stewards of
secrets. The book&rsquo;s subtitle was a <em>Sevenfold Account of the
Six Days of Genesis</em>, plainly an invitation to calculate
arithmetic mysteries. In 1489 the <em>Heptaplus</em> invoked a
theme&mdash;ascending to supreme happiness&mdash;that had occupied
Pico for years, at least since he started the <em>Commento</em>. So it
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if hebdomads in the <em>Heptaplus</em>
reflected earlier statements, including the <em>Oration</em>, which
can be analyzed as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">

<li>Humans are amazing because they can choose to change what they
are.</li>

<li>To choose well, however, they must change into angels.</li>

<li>And to emulate angels, they must live like Cherubs.</li>

<li>Humans can learn this lesson from ancient saints:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">

<li>Paul and Dionysius,</li>

<li>Jacob,</li>

<li>Job,</li>

<li>Moses,</li>

<li>Orpheus, Plato, Plotinus, Socrates and other gentiles,</li>

<li>Pythagoras,</li>

<li>Abraham, Chaldeans, Jeremiah and Zoroaster.</li>
</ol> </li>

<li>Because philosophy leads to the Cherubic life, Pico proclaims
himself a philosopher.</li>

<li>Philosophy has informed him about new practices, including magic
and Kabbalah.</li>

<li>Assured of philosophy&rsquo;s benefits, Pico will ignore his
critics and debate a philosophy of his own.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A curriculum reviewed 7 times in the middle of the <em>Oration</em>,
at step 4 of 7, taught lessons leading to mystical union with God.
Ancient Platonists discussed this regimen, and Church Fathers absorbed
it into Christian piety. Books of Kabbalah gave similar instructions.
Students started with moral philosophy and then moved up through
dialectic and natural philosophy toward theology until discursive
thought dissolved in ecstasy, pure contemplation and finally
unification. Stages of Pico&rsquo;s <em>paideia</em> were</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">

<li>moral philosophy</li>

<p>
Magic and Kabbalah were preliminary but necessary. Magic, propelling
the soul through the heavens toward supercelestial divinity, fueled a
transition from natural philosophy to natural theology and beyond. And
then Kabbalah, rising above discursive theology, climbing higher than
magic, changed embodied humans into pure spirits: entirely purged of
matter, these souls were then fit for
<em>hen&ocirc;sis</em>&mdash;absolute unification with God. The
philosophy behind this self-abnegating spirituality went back to pagan
commentators on Aristotle. Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd and other Muslim and
Jewish sages made it more explicit. Pico&rsquo;s advice&mdash;in
philosophical terms that were controversial yet more familiar to
Christians than Kabbalah&mdash;was for human persons to conjoin with
the Agent Intellect.</p>

<h3 id="BeinOneAstr">2.5 <em>Being and the One</em> and Astrology</h3>

<p>
The last major item in Pico&rsquo;s bibliography, the <em>Disputations
Against Astrology</em>, is textually problematic&mdash;like the
prince&rsquo;s letters&mdash;because Gianfrancesco may have meddled
with both. Otherwise, the best account of the <em>Disputations</em> is
Anthony Grafton&rsquo;s article, listed in Quaquarelli and
Zanardi&rsquo;s bibliography.</p>

<p>
Pico&rsquo;s big book was unwelcoming&mdash;unfinished, ragged
presentation, sources technical and obscure. Much of it repeated
ancient and medieval objections to astrology. Ptolemy&rsquo;s doubts
about particular types of prediction, for example, turned into a
general restriction on celestial influence, which was too diffuse or
too slight to produce reliable foreknowledge. Astrologers were exposed
for contradicting themselves and for violating canons of reason and
experience that natural philosophy relied on. Complaints restated by
Pico&mdash;epistemic, logical, methodological and
observational&mdash;had been made even before ancient sceptics
recorded their characteristic objections. The prince&rsquo;s
innovation, without entirely rejecting astrology, was to weaponize
philology against it.</p>

<p>
Astrology&rsquo;s credibility rested on its pedigree&mdash;descent
through the ages from ancient Chaldea and Egypt. The <em>Oration</em>
and <em>Conclusions</em> verified this genealogy and sanctified it
with Kabbalah, a tradition that was sacred, not just venerable. Like
Kabbalah and because of its age, astrology could be confirmed (or
disconfirmed) by the new classicism that linked authority with
antiquity. Astrology&rsquo;s record of watching planets and stars was
an experience of deep time that certified its findings, compiled over
the millennia.</p>

<p>
But the <em>Disputations</em> that Pico died too soon to finish
reformed this static mytho-history by bringing it down to earth and
back to life with new evidence. Informed by breakthroughs in biblical
and secular chronology, he relocated primordial icons like Zoroaster
in living landscapes of human time, subjecting them to criticism that
later experts would call &lsquo;historical&rsquo;. And yet
Pico&rsquo;s critical sense was far from modern. When he attacked the
stargazers as superstitious, he mistook strengths for weaknesses and
dismissed their mathematical skills as credulity. The arithmetic in
his own <em>Conclusions</em> was numerology, and his treatment of
mathematics was generally unprogressive&mdash;more like
Aristotle&rsquo;s attitude than Plato&rsquo;s. But Kepler noticed the
<em>Disputations</em>, and philologists, weighing Pico&rsquo;s doubts
about exotic sages, took the shine off the bronze of <em>prisca
theologia</em>.</p>

<p>
Ficino&rsquo;s ancient theology was a Platonic historiography. But the
prince&rsquo;s least eccentric work of philosophy took an Aristotelian
position against a Platonic distinction between being and the One that
made the One higher than being in the order of the All. Since Ficino
supported just such a distinction, Pico&rsquo;s fragment <em>On Being
and the One</em> challenged the senior philosopher, who saw it that
way and objected politely. A larger purpose, harmonizing Aristotle
with Plato, would have been germane. But the <em>Conclusions</em> had
subverted its own assertion of <em>concordia</em> just after stating
it. Even if Pico hadn&rsquo;t defaced his irenic coinage, he
wasn&rsquo;t Platonic enough to suit Ficino, just as he wasn&rsquo;t
Aristotelian enough for doctrinaire Aristotelians.</p>

<p>
The future marched to his music, however, if not under a banner of
<em>concordia</em>. Friends of the prince&mdash;Barbaro, Ficino,
Poliziano and others&mdash;promoted the philology that informed later
Aristotelians about <em>all</em> the ancient schools: not just
Platonists but also Epicureans, Pre-Socratics, Sceptics, Stoics and
others. Later, during the Enlightenment, philosophers scrutinized old
texts recently recovered to enforce the comparative
&lsquo;eclectic&rsquo; criticism promulgated by Jacob Brucker and
popularized by the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>. Brucker and the
<em>philosophes</em> despised Pico&rsquo;s <em>concordia</em>, mocking
it as the &lsquo;syncretism&rsquo; that muddled eclectic
reasoning.</p>

<p>
Ficino&rsquo;s geniality had encouraged Pico&rsquo;s urge to
harmonize, and his half-baked <em>concordia</em> was more than just
compatible with the ancient theology that was Ficino&rsquo;s way of
Christianizing pagan wisdom. The warm personal language of
correspondence between the two philosophers shows Ficino welcoming
Pico as a junior ally. But Ficino&rsquo;s letters, which he published
in 1495, testify better to his friendship with Pico than Pico&rsquo;s
letters. Gianfrancesco published them a year later, after preparing
the <em>Disputations</em> for the press at the same time. Comparing
the two epistolaries suggests that the younger Pico, at least as close
to Savonarola as his uncle, intervened to select letters by the elder
Pico&mdash;those that made it into the collected works of 1496
overseen by the nephew&mdash;and arranged them to match the pious
<em>Life</em> that introduced the whole collection.</p>

<p>
The all too human protagonist of the <em>Life</em> was a Savonarolan
saint who renounced the world, the flesh and the devil just in time.
This was not the eager Pico who had hunted for fame in Rome a few
years before and dared the world in a failed philosophical
extravaganza; nor the cocksure prince who bungled an attempt to carry
off a woman whose husband was named Medici&mdash;no less; nor the
unsettled journeyman thinker calmed by Ficino&rsquo;s bantering in
letters decorated with astro-mythology. The disasters of 1487 may be
enough to explain Pico&rsquo;s jarring reversal on astrology in the
<em>Disputations</em>, also his muffling of Kabbalah in the
<em>Heptaplus</em>. But since Gianfrancesco, who edited the
<em>Disputations</em>, also edited and chose letters to support a
tendentious <em>Life</em> of his uncle, and since the nephew was not
just a devout fideist but also a prodigiously productive scholar and
original thinker, the <em>Disputations</em> may have been another
pendant to Gianfrancesco&rsquo;s <em>Life</em> of Pico&mdash;dubious
in that setting as proof of penitence when his uncle&rsquo;s meteor
flamed out.</p>

<p>
In 1496, the Pico of the <em>Commentationes</em>
 <a href="#bb5">(5)</a>
 was his nephew&rsquo;s creation. Now, more than five centuries later,
Pico on the internet&mdash;even farther from his time and
place&mdash;is an artifact of the last century&rsquo;s scholarship,
whose even older philosophical attitudes were shaped by Kant and
Hegel. The <em>Commentationes</em>, edited posthumously by
Gianfrancesco Pico, was the first printed collection of works by his
uncle. Another early collection is
 <a href="#bb6">(6)</a>&mdash;often
 cited but not reliable. There is no complete modern set of vernacular
translations based on trustworthy Latin texts.</p>

<p>
The I Tatti Renaissance Library (<em>ITRL</em>), edited by James
Hankins for Harvard University Press, has begun filling this gap with
the <em>Oration</em>
 <a href="#bb39">(39)</a>
 in an English translation of a Latin text indebted to Bausi&rsquo;s
Italian edition
 <a href="#bb27">(27)</a>.
 While Pico lived the speech was never printed. The first translation
 <a href="#bb7">(7)</a>&mdash;into
 German&mdash;waited until 1905. Italian versions
 [<a href="#bb8">(8)</a>,
 <a href="#bb9">(9)</a>] followed during the Fascist period, and then another one
 <a href="#bb22">(22)</a>
 in 1995 under Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s imprint. Modern versions in
other languages are
 <a href="#bb14">(14)</a>,
 <a href="#bb31">(31)</a>, and
 <a href="#bb34">(34)</a>.
 But
 <a href="#bb11">(11)</a>,
 an <em>Oration</em> translated by Elizabeth Forbes, has been
Pico&rsquo;s main vehicle in English. Introduced by Kristeller, this
version has been in print for 76 years, a best seller in the North
American textbook market after Burckhardt, Cassirer, and Giovanni
Gentile had made the prince&rsquo;s speech famous.</p>

<p>
The first book that Pico had printed was his <em>900 Conclusions</em>,
forthcoming in an <em>ITRL</em> edition
 <a href="#bb40">(40)</a>;
 see other texts and translations in
 <a href="#bb20">(20)</a>,

 <a href="#bb36">(36)</a>,
 and
 <a href="#bb38">(38)</a>.
 Fornaciari&rsquo;s Italian version
 <a href="#bb32">(32)</a>
 of Pico&rsquo;s <em>Apology</em>
 <a href="#bb3">(3)</a>&mdash;which
 defended the condemned <em>Conclusions</em>&mdash;includes a Latin
text. Along with the <em>Oration</em>,
 <a href="#bb14">(14)</a>
 provides English translations of <em>De ente et uno</em> and the
<em>Heptaplus</em>, whose first edition was
 <a href="#bb4">(4)</a>;
 see
 <a href="#bb15">(15)</a>
 for another English <em>Heptaplus</em>. Pico never finished <em>De
ente et uno</em> or had it printed: Gianfrancesco published the Latin
text in
 <a href="#bb5">(5)</a>;
 Toussaint&rsquo;s edition
 <a href="#bb21">(21)</a>
 provides a French translation; the translation by Bacchelli and Ebgi
 <a href="#bb33">(33)</a>
 is Italian. Eugenio Garin edited the large, unfinished and
unpublished <em>Disputations</em>
 <a href="#bb12">(12)</a>:
 better understanding of this consequential but bulky and difficult
work awaits an improved edition and a vernacular translation.</p>

unfinished by the author and unpublished&mdash;see
 <a href="#bb16">(16)</a>,

 The Latin text of Pico&rsquo;s early letter in defense of
philosophical terminology is in

 for an English rendering. Minor works unpublished in his lifetime are

<em>Life</em> is in
