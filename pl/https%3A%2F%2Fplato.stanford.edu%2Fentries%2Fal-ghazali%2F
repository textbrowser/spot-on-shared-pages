<h1>al-Ghazali</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Aug 14, 2007; substantive revision Thu Jan 15, 2026</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; (<em>c</em>. 1056&ndash;1111) was one of the most
prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, and
mystics of Sunni Islam. He was active at a time when Sunni theology
had just passed through its consolidation and entered a period of
intense challenges from Shiite Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite theology and
the Arabic tradition of Aristotelian philosophy (<em>falsafa</em>).
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; understood the importance of <em>falsafa</em> and
developed a complex response that rejected and condemned some of its
teachings, while it also allowed him to accept and apply others.
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s critique of twenty positions of
<em>falsafa</em> in his <em>Incoherence of the Philosophers</em>
(<em>Tah&#257;fut al-fal&#257;sifa</em>) is a significant landmark in
the history of philosophy as it advances the nominalist critique of
Aristotelian science developed later in 14th century Europe. On the
Arabic and Muslim side al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s acceptance of
demonstration (<em>apodeixis</em>) led to a much more refined and
precise discourse on epistemology and a flowering of Aristotelian
logics and metaphysics. With al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; begins the
successful introduction of Aristotelianism or rather Avicennism into
Muslim theology. After a period of appropriation of the Greek sciences
in the translation movement from Greek into Arabic and the writings of
the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> up to Avicenna (Ibn S&#299;n&#257;,
<em>c</em>. 980&ndash;1037), philosophy and the Greek sciences were
&ldquo;naturalized&rdquo; into the discourse of <em>kal&#257;m</em>
and Muslim theology (Sabra 1987). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s
approach to resolving apparent contradictions between reason and
revelation was accepted by almost all later Muslim theologians and
had, via the works of Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126&ndash;98) and Jewish
authors, a significant influence on Latin medieval thinking.</p>

<h2><a id="Lif">1. Life</a></h2>

<p>
Later Muslim medieval historians say that Ab&#363; &#7716;&#257;mid
Mu&#7717;ammad ibn Mu&#7717;ammad al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was born in
1058 or 1059 in &#7788;abar&#257;n-&#7788;&#363;s (15 miles north of
modern Meshed, NE Iran), yet notes about his age in his letters and
his autobiography indicate that he was born in 1055 or 1056 (Griffel
2009, 23&ndash;25). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; received his early education
in his hometown of &#7788;&#363;s together with his brother
A&#7717;mad (<em>c</em>. 1060&ndash;1123 or 1126) who became a famous
preacher and Sufi scholar. Mu&#7717;ammad went on to study with the
influential Ash&rsquo;arite theologian al-Juwayn&#299; (1028&ndash;85)
at the Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya Madrasa in nearby Nishapur. This brought
him in close contact with the court of the Grand-Seljuq Sultan
Maliksh&#257;h (reg. 1071&ndash;92) and his grand-vizier
Ni&#7827;&#257;m al-Mulk (1018&ndash;92). In 1091 Ni&#7827;&#257;m
al-Mulk appointed al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; to the prestigious
Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya Madrasa in Baghdad. In addition to being a
confidante of the Seljuq Sultan and his court in Isfahan, he now
became closely connected to the caliphal court in Baghdad. He was
undoubtedly the most influential intellectual of his time, when in
1095 he suddenly gave up his posts in Baghdad and left the city. Under
the influence of Sufi literature al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; had begun to
change his lifestyle two years before his departure (Griffel 2009,
67). He realized that the high ethical standards of a virtuous
religious life are not compatible with being in the service of
sultans, viziers, and caliphs. Benefiting from the riches of the
military and political elite implies complicity in their corrupt and
oppressive rule and will jeopardize one&rsquo;s prospect of redemption
in the afterlife. When al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; left Baghdad in 1095 he
went to Damascus and Jerusalem and vowed at the tomb of Abraham in
Hebron never again to serve the political authorities or teach at
state-sponsored schools. He continued to teach, however, at small
schools (singl. <em>z&#257;wiya</em>) that were financed by private
donations. After performing the pilgrimage in 1096,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; returned via Damascus and Baghdad to his hometown
&#7788;&#363;s, where he founded a small private school and a Sufi
convent (<em>kh&#257;nq&#257;h</em>). In 1106, at the beginning of the
6th century in the Muslim calendar, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; broke his vow
and returned to teaching at the state-sponsored Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya
Madrasa in Nishapur, where he himself had been a student. To his
followers he justified this step with the great amount of theological
confusion among the general public and pressure from authorities at
the Seljuq court (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 45&ndash;50 = 2000b,
87&ndash;93). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; regarded himself as one of the
renewers (singl. <em>mu&#7717;y&#299;</em>) of religion, who,
according to a <em>&#7717;ad&#299;th</em>, will come every new
century. In Nishapur, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s teaching activity
at the Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya madrasa led to a controversy that was
triggered by opposition to his teachings, particularly those in his
most widely read work, <em>The Revival of the Religious Sciences</em>,
and by accusations that these show a distinct influence from
<em>falsafa</em>. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was summoned to defend himself
in front of the Seljuq governor Sanjar (d. 1157). The latter, however,
acquitted him from all charges and supported his teaching activity in
Nishapur (Garden 2014: 143&ndash;168). On this occasion,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; again asked to be released from his obligations
at the Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya madrasa, a request that was denied. All
this time, he continued to teach at his <em>z&#257;wiya</em> in
&#7788;&#363;s where he died in December 1111 (Griffel 2009,
20&ndash;59).</p>

<h2><a id="AlGhaRepFalTea">2. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s Reports of the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>&rsquo;s Teachings</a></h2>

<p>
After having already made a name for himself as a competent author of
legal works, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; published around 1095 a number of
books where he addresses the challenges posed by <em>falsafa</em> and
by the theology of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite Shiites. The movement
of <em>falsafa</em> (from Greek: <em>philosoph&iacute;a</em>) resulted
from the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific literature
into Arabic from the 8th to the early 10th centuries. The Arabic
philosophers (<em>fal&#257;sifa</em>) were heirs to the late-antique
tradition of understanding the works of Aristotle in Neoplatonic
terms. In philosophy the translators from Greek into Arabic focused on
the works of Aristotle and although some distinctly Neoplatonic texts
were translated into Arabic&mdash;most notably the pseudo-Aristotelian
<em>Theology</em>, a compilation from Plotinus&rsquo;
<em>Enneads</em>&mdash;the most significant Neoplatonic contributions
reached the Arabs by way of commentaries on the works of the Stagirite
(Wisnovsky 2003, 15). <em>Falsafa</em> was a movement where
Christians, Muslims, and even pagan authors participated. After the
12th century it would also include Jewish authors. For reasons that
will become apparent, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; focused his comments on the
Muslim <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>. In the early 10th century
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (d. 950) had developed a systemic philosophy
that challenged key convictions held by Muslim theologians, most
notably the creation of the world in time and the original character
of the information God reveals to prophets. Following Aristotle,
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; taught that the world has no beginning in the
past and that the celestial spheres, for instance, move from
pre-eternity. Prophets and the revealed religions they bring
articulate the same insights that philosophers express in their
teachings, yet the prophets use the method of symbolization to make
this wisdom more approachable for the ordinary people. Avicenna
continued al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s approach and developed his
metaphysics and his prophetology to a point where it offers
comprehensive explanations of God&rsquo;s essence and His actions as
well as a psychology that gives a detailed account of how prophets
receive their knowledge and how they, for instance, perform miracles
that confirm their missions. Avicenna&rsquo;s philosophy offers
philosophical explanations of key Muslim tenets like God&rsquo;s unity
(<em>tawh&#299;d</em>) and the central position of prophets among
humans.</p>

<p>
In his autobiography al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; writes that during his time
at the Baghdad Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya he studied the works of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> for two years before he wrote his
<em>Incoherence of the Philosophers</em> in a third year
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 18 = 2000b, 61). It is hardly credible,
however, that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; began to occupy himself with
<em>falsafa</em> only after he became professor at the
Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya in Baghdad. This account is apologetic and aims
to reject the claim of some of his critics that he had learned
<em>falsafa</em> before his own religious education was complete. Most
probably he had become acquainted with <em>falsafa</em> while studying
with al-Juwayn&#299;, whose works already show an influence from
Avicenna. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s response to Aristotelianism,
the <em>Incoherence of the Philosophers</em>, is a masterwork of
philosophical literature and may have been decades in the making. It
is accompanied by works where al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; provides faithful
reports of the philosophers&rsquo; teachings. Two of those works have
come down to us. The first is an almost complete fragment of a long
book where al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; copies or paraphrases passages from
the works of philosophers and combines them to a comprehensive report
about their teachings in metaphysics (Griffel 2006, al-Akiti 2009).
The fragment unfortunately bears no title. The second work, the
<em>Doctrines of the Philosophers</em> (<em>Maq&#257;&#7779;id
al-fal&#257;sifa</em>, on the translation of the title see Shihadeh
2011, 90&ndash;92), is a loosely adapted Arabic translation of the
parts on logics, metaphysics, and the natural sciences in
Avicenna&rsquo;s Persian work <em>Philosophy for
&lsquo;Al&#257;&rsquo; al-Dawla</em> (<em>D&#257;nishnamah-yi
Al&#257;&rsquo;&#299;</em>) (Janssens 1986). Previously it has been
assumed that the <em>Doctrines of the Philosophers</em> was written as
a preparatory study to his major work, the <em>Incoherence</em>. This
can no longer be upheld. Both reports of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; stand
only in a very loose connection to the text of the <em>Incoherence of
the Philosophers</em>. The <em>Incoherence</em> and the
<em>Doctrines</em> use different terminologies and the latter presents
its material in ways that does not support the criticism in the
<em>Incoherence</em> (Janssens 2003, 43&ndash;45). The <em>Doctrines
of the Philosophers</em> may have been a text that was initially
unconnected to the <em>Incoherence</em> or that was generated after
the composition of the latter. Only its introduction and its brief
<em>explicit</em> create a connection to the refutation in the
<em>Incoherence</em>. These parts were almost certainly written (or
added) after the publication of the <em>Incoherence</em> (Janssens
2003, 45; Griffel 2006, 9&ndash;10).</p>

<p>
<em>The Doctrines of the Philosophers</em> was translated into Latin
in the third quarter of the 12th century and into Hebrew first in 1292
and at least another two times within the next fifty years. These
translations enjoyed much more success than the Arabic original. In
the past, this lack of success of <em>The Doctrines of the
Philosophers</em> among Muslims was interpreted as evidence for a lack
of interest in Aristotelian philosophy (<em>falsafa</em>) after the
11th century. In reality, the reverse was probably true and there were
soon many books available in Arabic that competed with <em>The
Doctrines</em>. In fact, <em>The Doctrines</em> is the nucleus of a
new genre in Arabic literature, know as <em>&#7717;ikma</em>, that
follows the goal of presenting (and soon also improving)
Avicenna&rsquo;s philosophical system (Griffel 2021, 417&ndash;478).
Examples from the 13th century are <em>&#7716;id&#257;yat
al-&#7717;ikma</em> by al-Abhar&#299; (d. 1265) or <em>&#7716;ikmat
al-&#703;ayn</em> by al-K&#257;tib&#299; al-Qazw&#299;n&#299; (d. 1276
or 1294), which are of similar length, or from the 12th century Fakhr
al-D&#299;n al-R&#257;z&#299;&rsquo;s <em>al-Mulakhkha&#7779;</em> and
his <em>Mab&#257;&#7717;ith al-mashriqiyya</em>, which are longer.
None of them were translated into Latin and very few became available
in Hebrew. In the Latin as well as in the Hebrew traditions,
translations of <em>The Doctrines of the Philosophers</em>
overshadowed all of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s other writings. The
Latin translation, sometimes referred to as <em>Summa theoricae
philosophiae</em> or as <em>Logica et philosophia Algazelis</em>, was
the only book by al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; translated during the period of
the transmission of Arabic philosophy to Christian Europe (the part on
logic is edited in Lohr 1965, the two remaining parts on metaphysics
and the natural sciences in Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1933). It was translated
by Dominicus Gundisalivi (Gundissalinus, d. <em>c</em>. 1190) of
Toledo in collaboration with someone referred to as &ldquo;Magister
Iohannes&rdquo; (d. 1215), also known as Iohannes Hispanus (or
Hispalensis), probably an Arabized Christian (a Mozarab), who was dean
at the cathedral of Toledo in the 1180s and 1190s (Burnett 1994). The
two translators seem to have omitted the short introduction and the
<em>explicit</em> where the work is described as an uncommitted report
of the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>&rsquo;s teachings. A small number of
Latin manuscripts show signs that this translation was revised during
the 13th century (Lohr 1965, 229) and in one case they preserve a
Latin rendition of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s original introduction
(edited in Salman 1935, 125&ndash;27). That, however, had next to no
influence on the text&rsquo;s reception (Salman 1935), and the version
that circulated among readers of Latin does not include
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s distancing statements
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1506). The book thus concealed its character as
a report of Avicenna&rsquo;s teachings and its author
&ldquo;Algazel&rdquo; was considered a faithful follower of Avicenna
who had produced a masterful compendium of the latter&rsquo;s
philosophy. During the late 12th, the 13th, and the 14th centuries the
<em>Summa theoricae philosophiae</em> was a principal source on the
teachings of the Arabic philosophers in books by authors like Albert
the Great (d. 1280) and Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) that were essential
to the development of the Latin philosophical tradition. The work was
still used sporadically in the 15h century and even more often in the
16th century (Minnema 2014; Alonso 1958; d&rsquo;Alverny 1986).
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s identification as one of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> is usually attributed to the limited knowledge
of Latin scholars about matters relating to the authors of the texts
they read. The assumption, however, that the <em>Doctrines of the
Philosophers</em> is not merely a report of the teachings of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> but rather represents
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s genuine positions in philosophy is not
limited to the Latin tradition. There are Arabic manuscripts that
attribute a text that is quite similar to the <em>Doctrines of the
Philosophers</em> to al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; without mentioning that the
teachings therein are an uncommitted report. The oldest of these
manuscripts was produced at the beginning of the 13th century at
Maraghah, an important center of scholarship in NW Iran and is
available in facsimile (Pourjavady 2002, 2&ndash;62). It shows that
also in the Arabic tradition, the positions reported in the
<em>Doctrines of the Philosophy</em> were closely associated with
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;. The &ldquo;mis-identification&rdquo; of
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; as a follower of Avicenna may have its roots in
an attitude among some Arabic readers of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; who saw
in him a closer follower of the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> than the
mainstream Arabic tradition wished to acknowledge (Griffel 2021,
442&ndash;449).</p>

<p>
In its several Hebrew versions, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s
<em>Doctrines of the Philosophers</em> (known as <em>De&rsquo;&ocirc;t
ha-f&icirc;l&ocirc;s&ocirc;f&icirc;m</em> and <em>Kavvan&ocirc;t
ha-f&icirc;l&ocirc;s&ocirc;f&icirc;m</em>) was one of the most
widespread philosophical texts studied among Jews in Europe
(Steinschneider 1893, 1:296&ndash;326; Harvey 2001). The translator of
the first Hebrew version of 1292, the Jewish Averroist Isaac Albalag,
attached his own introduction and extensive notes to the text (Vajda
1960). This and the other two Hebrew translations attracted a great
number of commentators, including Moses Narboni (d. 1362), who was
active in southern France and Spain, and Moses Almosnino (d.
<em>c</em>. 1580) of Thessalonica (Steinschneider 1893,
1:311&ndash;25). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Doctrines of the
Philosophers</em> was a very popular text up to the 16th century and
over 75 manuscripts of the Hebrew translations are extant (Eran 2007,
Harvey 2015: 289). Some Jewish scholars, like the 14th century Katalan
Hasdai Crescas, saw in this Avicennan text a welcome alternative to
the equally widespread teachings of Averroes (Harvey and Harvey 2002;
Harvey 2015: 300&ndash;302). In fact, by the 15th century the Hebrew
version of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Doctrines of the
Philosophers</em> may have replaced Averroes as the most popular
source among Jews for the study of the Aristotelian natural sciences
(Harvey 2015: 289). Although the Hebrew translations make the
character of the work as a report clear, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
was&mdash;as in the Latin tradition&mdash;regarded as a much closer
follower of <em>falsafa</em> than in the mainstream Arabic tradition.
The Hebrew tradition, for instance, makes widely available the
translation of a text ascribed to al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; where the
author responds to questions about astronomy and cosmology that are
quite far from Ash&rsquo;arism and much closer to Aristotelianism
(Langermann 2011, Griffel 2021, 453&ndash;458). This relatively
widespread Hebrew text (edited and translated in Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
1896), referred to as <em>Teshuv&ocirc;t she&rsquo;al&ocirc;t</em>,
&ldquo;Answers to Questions,&rdquo; or more recently as the
&ldquo;Hebrew <em>Ajwiba</em>,&rdquo; exists in eleven Hebrew
manuscripts (Harvey 2015: 298). Its Arabic original is known only from
a very small number of manuscripts, among them the one from Maraghah
(Pourjavady 2002, 63&ndash;99). Accounts saying that
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; taught philosophical positions he had openly
condemned in his <em>Incoherence</em> were relatively widespread in
Hebrew literature (Marx 1935, 410, 422&ndash;24). Moses Narboni, for
instance, believed that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; used a stratagem to teach
philosophy at a time when it was, according to Narboni, officially
prohibited. By pretending to refute philosophy in his
<em>Incoherence</em> he could justify the writing of the
<em>Doctrines</em>. The <em>Doctrines</em> is therefore the main work
on philosophy by al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, Narboni suspected, while the
<em>Incoherence</em> serves only the function of legitimizing the
former&rsquo;s publication by saying that a refutation must rely on a
thorough knowledge of what is to be refuted (Chertoff 1952, part 2,
6&ndash;7). This tendency among Hebrew authors to disentangle
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; from the criticism of philosophy expressed in his
<em>Incoherence</em> led the Algerian Jewish scholar Abraham Gavison
(fl. 16th cent.) to report erroneously that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was
the author of both <em>The</em> <em>Incoherence of the
Philosophers</em> as well as its repudiation <em>The Incoherence of
the Incoherence</em> (<em>Tah&#257;fut al-tah&#257;fut</em>), a work
in reality written by Averroes (Gavison 1748, fol. 135a). In addition
to his <em>Doctrines</em>, his <em>Incoherence</em>, which was
translated in 1411, and the text known as <em>Teshuv&ocirc;t
she&rsquo;al&ocirc;t</em> (whose ascription to al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; is
doubtful), at least two other works by al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; were
translated into Hebrew: <em>Mishk&#257;t al-anw&#257;r</em> and
<em>M&#299;z&#257;n al-&#703;amal</em> (Steinschneider 1893,
1:326&ndash;48, the text <em>Moznei ha-&#703;iyyun&icirc;m</em>
mentioned there is not by al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;).</p>

<h2><a id="AlGhaRefFalIsm">3. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Refutations&rdquo; of <em>falsafa</em> and Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism</a></h2>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; describes the <em>Incoherence of the
Philosophers</em> as a &ldquo;refutation&rdquo; (<em>radd</em>) of the
philosophical movement (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 18 = 2000b, 61), and
this has contributed to the erroneous assumption that he opposed
Aristotelianism and rejected its teachings. In fact,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Tah&#257;fut</em> has long been
misunderstood in Western literature as an anti-philosophical pamphlet
from a religious zealot. For too long the book was read through
Averroes&rsquo;s (d. 1198) counter-refutation <em>The Incoherence of
the [Book of the] Incoherence</em> (<em>Tah&#257;fut
al-tah&#257;fut</em>) which was available in a Latin translation since
the early 14th century and an easily accessible English one since 1954
(Averroes 1961, 1954). Averroes denial that
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Tah&#257;fut</em> is a book of
philosophy was readily accepted by many Western readers. The
book&rsquo;s philosophical value as a refutation of a <em>particular
kind</em> of philosophy&mdash;and hence its genuine philosophical
character&mdash;has only been acknowledged in the 21st century
(Griffel 2009, 7; Griffel 2021, 6&ndash;9; Moad 2023, xiv&ndash;xviii,
345), after a full English translation became available in 1997
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a). In fact, acknowledging that
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Tah&#257;fut</em>&mdash;a book that
belongs to the genre of <em>kal&#257;m&mdash;</em>is a philosophical
book leads to wider repercussions for our understanding of the
philosophical tradition in Islam (Griffel 2021, 9&ndash;10).</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s response to <em>falsafa</em> was complex
and allowed him, among other things, to adopt many of its teachings.
The <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> are convinced, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
complains at the beginning of the <em>Incoherence</em>, that their way
of knowing by &ldquo;demonstrative proof&rdquo; (<em>burh&#257;n</em>)
is superior to theological knowledge drawn from revelation and its
rational interpretation. This conviction led &ldquo;a group&rdquo;
among the Muslim <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> who disregard Islam and who
neglect its ritual duties and its religious law
(<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>). In his <em>Incoherence</em>
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; discusses twenty key teachings of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> and rejects the claim that these teachings are
demonstratively proven. In a detailed and intricate philosophical
discussion al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; aims to show that none of the
arguments in favor of these twenty teachings fulfills the high
epistemological standard of demonstration (<em>burh&#257;n</em>) that
the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> have set for themselves. Rather, the
arguments supporting these twenty convictions rely upon unproven
premises that are accepted only among the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>, but
are not established by reason. By showing that these positions are
supported by mere dialectical arguments al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; aims to
demolish what he regarded was an epistemological hubris on the side of
the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>. In the <em>Incoherence</em> he wishes to
show that the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> practice <em>taql&#299;d</em>,
meaning they merely repeat these teachings from the founders of their
movement without critically examining them (Griffel 2005).</p>

<p>
The initial argument of the <em>Incoherence</em> focuses on
<em>apodeixis</em> and the demonstrative character of the arguments
refuted therein. While the book also touches on the truth of these
teachings, it &ldquo;refutes&rdquo; numerous positions whose truths
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; acknowledges or which he subscribed to in his
later works. In these cases al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; wishes to show that
while these particular philosophical teachings are sound and true,
they are not demonstrated. The ultimate source of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em>&rsquo;s knowledge about God&rsquo;s nature, the
human soul, or about the heavenly spheres, for instance, are the
revelations given to early prophets such as Abraham and Moses. Their
information made it into the books of the ancient philosophers who
falsely claimed that they gained these insights by reason alone. The
background of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s refution of these arguments
is that humans received knowledge in such sciences as medicine,
atronomy and metaphysics/theology not as a result of a purely
reasonable inquiries but either from the revelations of prophets or
the &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; (<em>ilh&#257;m</em>) given to Sufi masters (Griffel
2021, 257&ndash;59).</p>

<p>
Among the twenty discussions of the <em>Incoherence</em>, sixteen are
concerned with positions held in the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>&rsquo;s
metaphysics (<em>il&#257;hiyy&#257;t</em>) and four with positions
that appear in their natural sciences
(<em>tab&#299;&#703;yy&#257;t</em>). The 17th discussion on causality
will be analyzed below. The longest and most substantial discussion is
the first, which deals with Avicenna&rsquo;s and al-F&rsquo;s
arguments in favor of the world&rsquo;s pre-eternity (Hourani 1958,
Marmura 1959). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; denies that this position can be
demonstratively proven. In fact, he goes further and argues that an
eternal world is impossible, which in turn proves that the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em>&rsquo;s understanding of God is wrong. He draws
on arguments that were earlier developed by anti-Aristotelian critics
such as the Christian John Philoponus (Ya&#7717;y&#257;
l-Na&#7717;w&#299;, <em>c</em>. 490&ndash;<em>c</em>. 570) of
Alexandria. Philoponus&rsquo; arguments, most importantly those that
deny the possibility of an infinite number of events in the past, had
entered the Arabic discourse on the world&rsquo;s creation earlier
during the 9th century (Davidson 1987, 55&ndash;56, 86&ndash;116,
366&ndash;75).</p>

<p>
At the end of the <em>Incoherence</em> al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; asks
whether the twenty positions discussed in the book are in conflict
with the religious law (<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>). Most of them are
wrong, he says, yet pose no serious problems in terms of religion,
where they should be considered &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; (singl.
<em>bid&#703;a</em>). A small group of positions is considered wrong
as well as religiously problematic. These are three teachings from
Avicenna&rsquo;s philosophy, namely (1) that the world has no
beginning in the past and is not created in time, (2) that God&rsquo;s
knowledge includes only classes of beings (universals) and does not
extend to individual beings and their circumstances (particulars), and
(3) that after death the souls of humans will never again return into
bodies. In these three cases the teachings of Islam, which are based
on revelation, suggest the opposite, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; says, and
thus overrule the unfounded claims of the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>.
What&rsquo;s more, these three teachings may mislead the public to
disregarding the religious law (<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>) and are,
therefore, dangerous for society (Griffel 2000, 301&ndash;3). In his
function as a Muslim jurisprudent al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; adds a brief
<em>fatw&#257;</em> at the end of his <em>Incoherence</em> and
declares that everybody who teaches these three positions publicly is
an unbeliever (<em>k&#257;fir</em>) and an apostate from Islam, who
can be killed (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a, 226; Griffel 2000,
282&ndash;91).</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s efforts in dealing with the philosophical
movement amount to defining the boundaries of religious tolerance in
Islam. Soon after the <em>Incoherence</em>, he wrote a similar book
about the movement of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite Shiites, known as
the &ldquo;B&#257;&#7789;inites&rdquo; (&ldquo;those who arbitrarily
follow an inner meaning in the Qur&rsquo;an&rdquo;). Initially the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite Shiites were supporters of the
F&#257;&#7789;imid counter-caliphate in Cairo and opposed the
political and religious authority of the Sunni caliph in Baghdad and
the Seljuq Sultans that he installed. During
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s lifetime, however, there occurred a
schism within the clandestine Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite movement. The
&ldquo;new propaganda&rdquo; of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites in Iraq
and Iran was now independent from the center in Cairo and developed
its own strategies. A key element of their&mdash;not entirely
unsuccessful&mdash;efforts to persuade people to their camp was their
criticism of sense perception and of rational arguments
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1954, 34; 1964b, 76, 80). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
was closely familiar with the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites&rsquo;
propaganda efforts but did not always have reliable information on
their teachings on cosmology and metaphysics. These were deeply
influenced by cosmological notions in late antique Gnostic and
Neoplatonic literature (Walker 1993, de Smet 1995). What information
he got, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; seems to have received from the Persian
writings of the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite propagandist and philosopher
N&#257;&#7779;ir-i Khosrow (d. <em>c</em>. 1075), who lived a
generation earlier in Balkh in Khorasan and in the remote region of
the Pamir Mountains (Andani 2017). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, however, did
not know about the schism within the movement. In his book on the
<em>Scandals of the Esoterics</em> (<em>Fa&#7693;&#257;&#702;i&#7717;
al-B&#257;&#7789;iniyya</em>) he looks closely at those teachings that
he knew and discusses which of them are merely erroneous and which are
unbelief. He assumes&mdash;wrongly&mdash;that the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite propagandists teach the existence of two
gods. Yet this presentation is not so much a misunderstanding on the
side of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; but rather a deliberate
misrepresentation, based on a long discourse of
anti-Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lite polemics (Andani 2017: 193). This
assumed dualism and the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites&rsquo; denial of
bodily resurrection in the afterlife leads to their condemnation by
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; as unbelievers and apostates from Islam
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1964b, 151&ndash;55 = 2000b, 228&ndash;29).</p>

<h2><a id="PlaFalIsl">4. The Place of <em>falsafa</em> in Islam</a></h2>

<p>
In his attempt to define the boundaries of Islam al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
singles out a limited number of teachings that in his opinion overstep
the borders. In a separate book, <em>The</em> <em>Decisive Criterion
for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief</em>
(<em>Fay&#7779;al al-tafriqa bayna l-Isl&#257;m wa-l-zandaqa</em>) he
clarifies that only teachings that violate certain &ldquo;fundamental
doctrines&rdquo; (<em>u&#7779;&#363;l al-&#703;aq&#257;&#702;id</em>)
should be deemed unbelief and apostasy. These doctrines are limited to
three: monotheism, Muhammad&rsquo;s prophecy, and the Qur&rsquo;anic
descriptions of life after death (al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1961, 195 =
2002, 112). He stresses that all other teachings, including those that
are erroneous or even regarded as &ldquo;religious innovations&rdquo;
(singl. <em>bid&#703;a</em>), should be tolerated. Again other
teachings may be correct, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; adds, and despite their
philosophical background, for instance, should be accepted by the
Muslim community. Each teaching must be judged by itself, and if found
sound and in accordance with revelation, should be adopted
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 25&ndash;27 = 2000b, 67&ndash;70). This
attitude leads to a widespread application of Aristotelian teachings
in al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s works on Muslim theology and
ethics.</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s refutations of the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>
and the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites have a distinctly political
component. In both cases he fears that the followers of these
movements as well as people with only a cursory understanding of them
might believe that they can disregard the religious law
(<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>). In the case of the
Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites there was an additional theological motive.
In their religious propaganda the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites openly
challenged the authority of Sunni theology, claiming its religious
speculation and its interpretation of scripture is arbitrary. The
Sunni theologians submit God&rsquo;s word to judgments that appear to
be reasonable, the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites said, yet they are
purely capricious, a fact evident from the many disputes among Sunni
theologians. No rational argument is more convincing than any of its
opposing rational arguments, the Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lites claimed,
since all rational proofs are mutually equivalent
(<em>tak&#257;fu&rsquo; al-adilla</em>). Only the divinely guided word
of the Shiite Imam conveys certainty (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1964b, 76, 80
= 2000b, 189, 191). In response to this criticism al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
introduces the Aristotelian notion of demonstration
(<em>burh&#257;n</em>). Sunni theologians argue among each other, he
says, because they are largely unfamiliar with the technique of
demonstration. For al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; reason (<em>&#703;aql</em>) is
executed most purely and precisely by formulating arguments that are
demonstrative and reach a level where their conclusions are beyond
doubt. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; wrote in one of his letters to a student
that later circulated as an independent epistle: &ldquo;A [valid]
rational demonstration is never wrong&rdquo; (Griffel 2015:
110&ndash;112). This also implies that the results of true
demonstrations cannot conflict with revelation since neither reason
nor revelation can be considered false. If demonstration proves
something that violates the literal meaning of revelation, the scholar
must apply &ldquo;allegorical interpretation&rdquo; (<em>ta&#702;w&#299;l</em>) to
the outward text and read it as a symbol of a deeper truth. There are,
for instance, valid demonstrative arguments proving that God cannot
have a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; or sit on a &ldquo;throne.&rdquo; These
prompt the Muslim scholar to interpret the Qur&rsquo;anic passages
where these words appear as symbols (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1961,
175&ndash;89 = 2002, 96&ndash;103). The interpretation of passages in
revelation, however, whose outward meaning is not disproved by a valid
demonstration, is not allowed (Griffel 2000, 332&ndash;35; 2009,
111&ndash;16).</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s rule for reconciling apparent conflicts
between reason and the literal meaning of revelation was widely
accepted by almost all later Muslim theologians, particularly those
with rationalist tendencies. Ibn Taymiyya (1263&ndash;1328), however,
criticized al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s rule from an scriptualist
angle. Ibn Taymiyya (1980, 1:86&ndash;87) rejected
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s implication that in cases of conflict
between reason and the revealed text, priority should be given to the
former over the latter. He also remarked that
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s own arguments denying the possibility
that God sits on a &ldquo;throne&rdquo; (Qur&rsquo;an 2.255), for
instance, fail to be demonstrative. Ibn Taymiyya flatly denied the
possibility of a conflict between reason and revelation and maintained
that the perception of such a disagreement results from subjecting
revelation to premises that revelation itself does not accept (Heer
1993, 188&ndash;92).</p>

<p>
On the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>&rsquo;s side Averroes accepted
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s rule for reconciling conflicts between
reason and the outward meaning of revelation but he did not agree with
his findings on what can and cannot be demonstrated (Griffel 2000,
437&ndash;61). Averroes composed a refutation of
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Incoherence</em>, which he called
<em>The Incoherence of the [Book of the] Incoherence</em>
(<em>Tah&#257;fut al-tah&#257;fut</em>). This work was translated
twice into Latin in 1328 and 1526, the later one on the basis of an
earlier Hebrew translation of the text (Steinschneider 1893,
1:330&ndash;38). The two Latin translations both have the title
<em>Destructio destructionum</em> (the later one is edited in Averroes
1961). They were printed numerous times during the 16th century and
made al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s criticism of Aristotelianism known
among the Averroists of the Renaissance. The Italian Agostino Nifo
(<em>c</em>. 1473&ndash; after 1538), for instance, wrote a Latin
commentary to Averroes&rsquo; book. While accepting the principle that
only a valid demonstration allows interpreting the Qur&rsquo;an
allegorically, Averroes maintained that Aristotle had already
demonstrated the pre-eternity of the world, which would elevate it,
according to al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s rules, to a philosophical as
well as religious doctrine. Averroes also remarked that there is no
passage in the Qur&rsquo;an that unambiguously states the creation of
the world in time (Averroes 2001, 16). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was
clearly aware of this but assumed that this tenet is established
through the consensus (<em>ijm&#257;&#703;</em>) of Muslim theologians
(Griffel 2000, 278, 429&ndash;30; 2002, 58). While
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; condemns the pre-eternity of the world at the end
of his <em>Incoherence of the Philosophers</em>, the subject of the
world&rsquo;s pre-eternity is no longer raised in his later more
systematic work on the boundaries of Islam, <em>The</em> <em>Decisive
Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief</em>.</p>

<h2><a id="EthRevRelSci">5. The Ethics of the <em>Revival of the Religious Sciences</em></a></h2>

<p>
Soon after al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; had published his two refutations of
<em>falsafa</em> and Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;lism he left his position at
the Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya madrasa in Baghdad. During this period he
began writing what most Muslim scholars regard as his major work,
<em>The Revival of the Religious Sciences</em> (<em>Ihy&#257;&#702;
&#703;ul&#363;m al-d&#299;n</em>). The voluminous <em>Revival</em> is
a comprehensive guide to ethical behavior in the everyday life of
Muslims (Garden 2014: 63&ndash;122). It is divided into four sections,
each containing ten books. The first section deals with ritual
practices (<em>&#703;ib&#257;d&#257;t</em>), the second with social
customs (<em>&#703;&#257;d&#257;t</em>), the third with those things
that lead to perdition (<em>muhlik&#257;t</em>) and hence should be
avoided, and the fourth with those that lead to salvation
(<em>munjiy&#257;t</em>) and should be sought. In the forty books of
the <em>Revival</em> al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; severely criticizes the
coveting of worldly matters and reminds his readers that human life is
a path towards Judgment Day and the reward or punishment gained
through it. Compared with the eternity of the next life, this life is
almost insignificant, yet it seals our fate in the world to come. In
his autobiography al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; writes that reading Sufi
literature made him realize that our theological convictions are by
themselves irrelevant for gaining redemption in the afterlife. Not our
good beliefs or intentions count; only our good and virtuous actions
will determine our life in the world to come. This insight prompted
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; to change his lifestyle and adopt the Sufi path
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 35&ndash;38 = 2000b, 77&ndash;80). In the
<em>Revival</em> he composed a book about human actions
(<em>mu&#703;&#257;mal&#257;t</em>) that wishes to steer clear of any
deeper discussion of theological insights
(<em>muk&#257;shaf&#257;t</em>). Rather, it aims at guiding people
towards ethical behavior that God will reward in this world and the
next (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1937&ndash;38, 1:4&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
In the <em>Revival</em> al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; attacks his colleagues in
Muslim scholarship, questioning their intellectual capacities and
independence as well as their commitment to gaining reward in the
world to come. This increased moral consciousness brings
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; close to Sufi attitudes, which have a profound
influence on his subsequent works such as <em>The Niche of Lights</em>
(<em>Mishk&#257;t al-anw&#257;r</em>). These later works also reveal a
significant philosophical influence on al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;. In the
<em>Revival</em> he teaches ethics that are based on the development
of character traits (singl., <em>khulq</em>, pl.
<em>akhl&#257;q</em>). Performing praiseworthy deeds is an effect of
praiseworthy character traits that warrant salvation in the next life
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1937&ndash;38, 1:34.4&ndash;5). He criticizes
the more traditional concept of Sunni ethics that is limited to
compliance with the ordinances of the religious law
(<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>) and following the example of the Prophet
Muhammad. Traditional Sunni ethics are closely linked to jurisprudence
(<em>fiqh</em>) and limit itself, according to al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;,
to determining and teaching the rules of <em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>.
Traditional Sunni jurisprudents are mere &ldquo;scholars of this
world&rdquo; (<em>&#703;ulam&#257;&#702; al-duny&#257;</em>) who
cannot guide Muslims on the best way to gain the afterlife
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1937&ndash;38, 1:30&ndash;38, 98&ndash;140).</p>

<p>
In his own ethics al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; stresses that the
Prophet&mdash;and no other teacher&mdash;should be the one person a
Muslim emulates. He supplements this key Sunni notion with the concept
of &ldquo;disciplining the soul&rdquo; (<em>riy&#257;&#7693;at
al-nafs</em>). At birth the essence of the human is deficient and
ignoble and only strict efforts and patient treatment can lead it
towards developing virtuous character traits (Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
1937&ndash;38, book 23). The human soul&rsquo;s temperament, for
instance, becomes imbalanced through the influence of other people and
needs to undergo constant disciplining (<em>riy&#257;&#7693;a</em>)
and training (<em>tarbiya</em>) in order to keep these character
traits at equilibrium. Virtues are acquired (and vices shunned) by the
constant habituation of the soul through repeated actions, first
forced and later becoming like a second nature (Vasalou 2023). Behind
this kind of ethics stands the Aristotelian notion of
<em>entelechy</em>: humans have a natural potential to develop
rationality and through it acquire virtuous character. Education,
literature, religion, and politics should help realizing this
potential. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; became acquainted with an ethic that
focuses on the development of virtuous character traits through the
works of Muslim <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> like Miskawayh (d. 1030) and
Muslim scholars like al-R&#257;ghib al-I&#7779;fah&#257;n&#299; (d.
<em>c</em>. 1025), who strove to make philosophical notions compatible
with Muslim religious scholarship (Madelung 1974). As a result
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; rejected the notion, for instance, that one
should try to give up potentially harmful affections like anger or
sexual desire. These character traits are part of human nature,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; teaches, and cannot be given up. Rather,
disciplining the soul means controlling these potentially harmful
traits through one&rsquo;s rationality (<em>&lsquo;aql</em>). The
human soul has to undergo constant training and needs to be
disciplined similar to a young horse that needs to be broken in,
schooled, and treated well.</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; combines the virtue ethics of his
<em>Revival</em>, which can also be found in the slightly earlier work
<em>M&#299;z&#257;n al-&#703;amal</em> (<em>Scale of Action</em>) and
in the Persia <em>K&#299;miy&#257;&#702;-i sa&#703;&#257;d&#257;t</em>
(<em>The Alchemy of Happiness</em>) with the idea of godlikeness.
Humans are motivated to become virtuous by Revelation&rsquo;s promised
reward in the afterlife but also by the idea that the virtues bring
them closer to become <em>like</em> God. This idea is particularly
prominent in al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; work <em>al-Maq&#7779;ad
al-asn&#257; f&#299; shar&#7717; ma&#703;&#257;n&#299; asm&#257;&#702;
All&#257;h al-husn&#257;</em> (<em>The Highest Goal in Explaining the
Beautiful Names of God</em>), a commentary on the &ldquo;divine
names&rdquo; that the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad is believed to have
taught to his followers. For al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, these
&ldquo;names&rdquo; (which are active particibles) indicate vrtuous
&ldquo;states&rdquo; that the believer should strive toward (Vasalou
2025).</p>

<p>
At no point does al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; reveal the philosophical origins
of his ethics. He himself saw a close connection between the ethics of
the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> and Sufi notions of an ascetic and virtuous
lifestyle. In his <em>Revival</em> he merges these two ethical
traditions to a successful and influential fusion. In his
autobiography al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; says that the ethics of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> and that of the Sufis are one and the same.
Congruent with his position that many teachings and arguments of the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> are taken from earlier revelations and from the
divinely inspired insights of mystics, who existed already in
pre-Islamic religions (Treiger 2012, 99&ndash;101) he adds that the
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> have taken their ethics from the Sufis, meaning
here mystics among the earlier religions (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 24
= 2000b, 67).</p>

<p>
Another important field where al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; introduced
Avicennan ideas into Ash&#703;arite <em>kal&#257;m</em> in a way that
this tradition eventually adopted them is human psychology and the
rational explanation of prophecy (Griffel 2004, al-Akiti 2004). Based
on partly mis-translated texts by Aristotle (Hansberger 2011),
Avicenna developed a psychology that assumes the existence of several
distinct faculties of the soul. These faculties are stronger or weaker
in individual humans. Prophecy is the combination of three faculties
which the prophet has in an extraordinarily strong measure. These
faculties firstly allow the prophet to acquire theoretical knowledge
instantly without learning, secondly represent this knowledge through
symbols and parables as well as divine future events, and thirdly to
bring about effects outside of his body such as rain or earthquakes.
These three faculties exist in every human in a small measure, a fact
proven by the experience of <em>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</em>, for
instance, a phenomenon referred to in the Arabic philosophic tradition
as &ldquo;the veridical dream&rdquo; (<em>al-man&#257;m
al-&#7779;&#257;diq</em>). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; adopted these
teachings and appropriated them for his own purposes (Treiger 2012).
The existence of the three faculties in human souls that make up
prophecy serves for him as an explanation of the higher insights that
mystics such as Sufi masters have in comparison to other people. While
prophets have strong prophetic faculties and ordinary humans very weak
ones, the &ldquo;friends of God&rdquo; (<em>awliy&#257;&#702;</em>,
i.e. Sufi masters) stand in between these two. They are endowed with
&ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; (<em>ilh&#257;m</em>), which is similar to
prophecy and which serves in al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; as one of the most
important sources of human knoweldge. Unlike Avicenna, for whom
prophets and maybe also some particularly talented humans
(<em>&#703;&#257;rif&#363;n</em> in his language) acquire the same
knowledge that philosophers reach through apodictic reasoning, in
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; the prophets and <em>awliy&#257;</em> have access
to knowledge that is superior to that available solely through
reason.</p>

<p>
Despite the significant philosophical influence on
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s ethics, he maintained in Islamic law
(<em>fiqh</em>) the Ash&#703;arite position that human rationality is
misleading with regard to normative judgments about human actions and
cannot decide whether an action is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bad.&rdquo; When humans think they know, for instance, that
lying is bad, their judgment is determined by a consideration of their
benefits. With regard to the ethical value of our actions we have a
tendency to confuse moral value with benefit. We generally tend to
assume that whatever benefits our collective interest is morally good,
while whatever harms us collectively is bad. These judgments, however,
are ultimately fallacious and cannot be the basis of jurisprudence
(<em>fiqh</em>). &ldquo;Good&rdquo; actions are those that are
rewarded in the afterlife and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; actions are those that
are punished (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1904&ndash;07, 1:61). The kind of
connection between human actions and reward or punishment in the
afterlife can only be learned from revelation (Hourani 1976, Marmura
1968&ndash;69). Muslim jurisprudence is the science that extracts
general rules from revelation. Like most religious sciences it aims at
advancing humans&rsquo; prospect of redemption in the world to come.
Therefore it must be based on the Qur&rsquo;an and the <em>sunna</em>
of the Prophet while it uses logic and other rational means to extract
general rules.</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was one of the first Muslim jurists who
introduced the consideration of a &ldquo;public benefit&rdquo;
(<em>ma&#7779;la&#7717;a</em>) into Muslim jurisprudence. In addition
to developing clear guidance of how to gain redemption in the
afterlife, religious law (<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>) also aims at
creating an environment that allows each individual wellbeing and the
pursuit of a virtuous and pious lifestyle. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; argues
that when God revealed divine law (<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>) He did
so with the purpose (<em>maq&#7779;ad</em>) of advancing human
benefits in this world <em>and</em> the next. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
identifies five essential components for wellbeing in this world:
religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property. Whatever protects
these &ldquo;five necessities&rdquo;
(<em>al-&#7693;ar&#363;riyy&#257;t al-khamsa</em>) is considered
public benefit (<em>ma&#7779;la&#7717;a</em>) and should be advanced,
while whatever harms them should be avoided. The jurisprudent
(<em>faq&#299;h</em>) should aim at safeguarding these five
necessities in his legal judgments. In recommending this,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; practically implies that a
&ldquo;<em>ma&#7779;la&#7717;a mursala</em>,&rdquo; a public benefit
that is not mentioned in the revealed text, is considered a valid
source of legislation (Opwis 2007 and 2010, 65&ndash;88).</p>

<h2><a id="CosRevRelSci">6. Cosmology in the <em>Revival of the Religious Sciences</em></a></h2>

<p>
Despite his declared reluctance to enter into theological discussions,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; addresses in his <em>Revival</em> important
philosophical problems related to human actions. In the 35th book on
&ldquo;Belief in Divine Unity and Trust in God&rdquo; (<em>Kit&#257;b
al-Taw&#7717;&#299;d wa-l-tawakkul</em>) he discusses the relationship
between human actions and God&rsquo;s omnipotence as creator of the
world. In this and other books of the <em>Revival</em>
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; teaches a strictly determinist position with
regard to events in the universe. God creates and determines
everything, including the actions of humans. God is the only
&ldquo;agent&rdquo; or the only &ldquo;efficient cause&rdquo;
(<em>f&#257;&#703;il</em>, the Arabic term means both) in the world.
Every event in creation follows a pre-determined plan that is
eternally present in God&rsquo;s knowledge. God&rsquo;s knowledge
exists in a timeless realm and does not contain individual
&ldquo;cognitions&rdquo; (<em>&#703;ul&#363;m</em>) like human
knowledge does. God&rsquo;s knowledge does not change, for instance,
when its object, the world, changes. While the events that are
contained in God&rsquo;s knowledge are ordered in &ldquo;before&rdquo;
and &ldquo;after&rdquo;, there is no past, present, and future.
God&rsquo;s knowledge contains the first moment of creation just as
the last, and He knows &ldquo;in His eternity,&rdquo; for instance,
whether a certain individual will end up in paradise or hell (Griffel
2009, 175&ndash;213).</p>

<p>
For all practical purposes it befits humans to assume that God
controls everything through chains of causes (Marmura 1965,
193&ndash;96). We witness in nature causal processes that add up to
longer causal chains. Would we be able to follow a causal chain like
an &ldquo;inquiring wayfarer&rdquo; (<em>s&#257;lik
s&#257;&#702;il</em>), who follows a chain of events to its origin, we
would be led through causal processes in the sub-lunar sphere, the
&ldquo;world of dominion&rdquo; (<em>&#703;&#257;lam al-mulk</em>),
further to causes that exist in the celestial spheres, the
&ldquo;world of sovereignty&rdquo; (<em>&#703;&#257;lam
al-malak&#363;t</em>), until we would finally reach the highest
celestial intellect, which is caused by the being beyond it, God
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1937&ndash;38, 13:2497&ndash;509 = 2001,
15&ndash;33; see also idem 1964a, 220&ndash;21). God is the starting
point of all causal chains and He creates and controls all elements
therein. God is &ldquo;the one who makes the causes function as
causes&rdquo; (<em>musabbib al-asb&#257;b</em>) (Frank 1992, 18).</p>

<p>
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;causal&rdquo; determination of all events also
extends to human actions. Every human action is caused by the
person&rsquo;s volition, which is caused by a certain motive
(<em>d&#257;&#703;iya</em>). The person&rsquo;s volition and motive
are, in turn, caused by the person&rsquo;s convictions and his or her
knowledge (<em>&#703;ilm</em>). Human knowledge is caused by various
factors, like one&rsquo;s experience of the world, one&rsquo;s
knowledge of revelation, or the books one has read (Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
1937&ndash;38, 13:2509&ndash;11 = 2001, 34&ndash;37). There is no
single event in this world that is not determined by God&rsquo;s will.
While humans are under the impression that they have a free will,
their actions are in reality compelled by causes that exist within
them as well as outside (Griffel 2009, 213&ndash;34).</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; viewed the world as a conglomerate of connections
that are all pre-determined and meticulously planned in God&rsquo;s
timeless knowledge. God creates the universe as a huge apparatus and
employs it in order to pursue a certain goal (<em>qa&#7779;d</em>). In
two of his later works al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; compares the universe with
a water-clock. Here he describes three stages of its creation. The
builder of the water-clock first has to make a plan of it, secondly
execute this plan and build the clock, and thirdly he has to make the
clock going by supplying it with a constant source of energy, namely
the flow of water. That energy needs to be carefully measured, because
only the right amount of energy will produce the desired result. In
God&rsquo;s creation of the universe these three stages are called
judgment (<em>&#7717;ukm</em>), decree
(<em>qa&#7693;&#257;&#702;</em>), and pre-destination (<em>qadar</em>)
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1971, 98&ndash;102; 1964a, 12&ndash;14). God
designs the universe in His timeless knowledge, puts it into being at
one point in time, and provides it with a constant and well-measured
supply of &ldquo;being&rdquo; (<em>wuj&#363;d</em>). According to
Avicenna&rsquo;s explanation of creation&mdash;which
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; was not opposed to&mdash;&ldquo;being&rdquo; is
passed down from God to the first and ontologically highest creation
and from there in a chain of secondary efficient causes to all other
existents. It is important to acknowledge, however, that God is the
only true efficient cause (<em>f&#257;&#703;il</em>) in this chain. He
is the only &ldquo;agent,&rdquo; all other beings are merely employed
in His service (Griffel 2009, 236&ndash;53).</p>

<p>
Nature is a process in which all elements harmoniously dovetail with
one another. Celestial movements, natural processes, human actions,
even redemption in the afterlife are all &ldquo;causally&rdquo;
determined. Whether we will be rewarded or punished in the afterlife
can be understood, according to al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, as the mere
causal effect of our actions in this world. In the 32nd book of his
<em>Revival</em> al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; explains how knowing the
Qur&rsquo;an causes the conviction (<em>i&#703;tiq&#257;d</em>) that
one is punished for bad deeds, and how that conviction may cause
salvation in the afterlife:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;and the conviction [that some humans will be punished] is a
cause (<em>sabab</em>) for the setting in of fear, and the setting in
of fear is a cause for abandoning the passions and retreating from the
abode of delusions. This is a cause for arriving at the vicinity of
God, and God is the one who makes the causes function as causes
(<em>musabbib al-asb&#257;b</em>) and who arranges them
(<em>murattibuh&#257;</em>). These causes have been made easy for him,
who has been predestined in eternity to earn redemption, so that
through their chaining-together the causes will lead him to paradise.
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1937&ndash;38, 11:2225.)
</blockquote>

<p>
All these are teachings that are very close to those of Avicenna
(Frank 1992, 24&ndash;25). Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; also followed Avicenna
in his conviction that this universe is the best of all possible
worlds and that &ldquo;there is in possibility nothing more wondrous
than what is&rdquo; (<em>laysa f&#299; l-imk&#257;n abda&rsquo;
mimm&#257; k&#257;n</em>) (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1937&ndash;38,
13:2515&ndash;18 = 2001, 47&ndash;50). This led to a long-lasting
debate among later Muslim theologians about what is meant by this
sentence and whether al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; is, in fact, right (Ormsby
1984). It must be stressed, however, that contrary to
Avicenna&mdash;and contrary to Frank&rsquo;s (1992, 55&ndash;63)
understanding of him&mdash;al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; firmly held that God
exercises a genuine free will and that when He creates, He chooses
between alternatives. God&rsquo;s will is not in any way determined by
God&rsquo;s nature or essence. God&rsquo;s will is the undetermined
determinator of everything in this world.</p>

<h2><a id="CauAlGha">7. Causality in al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;</a></h2>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s cosmology of God&rsquo;s determination
and His control over events in His creation through chains of causes
(singl. <em>sabab</em>) aimed at safeguarding the Sunni doctrine of
omnipotence and divine pre-determination against the criticism of
Mu&#703;tazilites and Shiites. Humans have only the impression of a
free will (<em>ikhtiy&#257;r</em>). In reality they are compelled to
choose what they deem is the best action (<em>khayr</em>) among the
present alternatives. Avicenna&rsquo;s determinist ontology, where
every event in the created world is by itself contingent (<em>mumkim
al-wuj&#363;d bi-dh&#257;tih&#299;</em>) yet also necessitated by
something else (<em>w&#257;jib al-wuj&#363;d bi-ghayrih&#299;</em>),
provided a suitable interpretation of God&rsquo;s pre-determination
and is readily adopted by al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; although he never
admits that or uses Avicenna&rsquo;s language. In Avicenna the First
Being, which is God, makes all other beings and events necessary. In
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;, God&rsquo;s will, which is distinct from His
essence, necessitates all beings and events in creation. The
adaptation of fundamental assumptions in Avicenna&rsquo;s cosmology
together with an almost wholesale acceptance of Avicenna&rsquo;s
psychology and his prophetology led Frank (1992, 86) to conclude
&ldquo;that from a theological standpoint most of [Avicenna&rsquo;s]
theses which he rejected are relatively tame and inconsequential
compared to those in which he follows the philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
While al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s determinist cosmology is a radical
but faithful interpretation of the Ash&rsquo;arite tenet of divine
pre-determination, the way al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; writes about it in his
<em>Revival</em> and later works violates other principles of
Ash&#703;arism and has led to much confusion among modern
interpreters. The remainder of this article will make an attempt to
resolve current interpretative problems and explain
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s innovative approach towards
causality.</p>

<h3><a id="OccVerSecCau">7.1 Occasionalism versus Secondary Causality</a></h3>

<p>
Al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; (873&ndash;935), the founder of the theological
school that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; belonged to, had rejected the
existence of &ldquo;natures&rdquo; (<em>tab&#257;&#702;i&#703;</em>)
and of causal connections among created beings. In a radical attempt
to explain God&rsquo;s omnipotence, he combined several ideas that
were developed earlier in Muslim <em>kal&#257;m</em> to what became
known as occasionalism. All material things are composed of atoms that
have no qualities or attributes but simply make up the shape of the
body. The atoms of the bodies are the carrier of
&ldquo;accidents&rdquo; (singl. <em>&lsquo;ara&#7693;</em>), which are
attributes like weight, density, color, smell, etc. In the cosmology
of al-Ash&#703;ar&#299; all immaterial things are considered
&ldquo;accidents&rdquo; that inhere in a &ldquo;substance&rdquo;
(<em>jawhar</em>). Only the atoms of spatially extended bodies can be
substances. A person&rsquo;s thoughts, for instance, are considered
accidents that inhere in the atoms of the person&rsquo;s brain, while
his or her faith is an accident inhering in the atoms of the heart.
None of the accidents, however, can subsist from one moment
(<em>waqt</em>) to the next. This leads to a cosmology where in each
moment God assigns the accidents to bodies in which they inhere. When
one moment ends, God creates new accidents. None of the created
accidents in the second moment has any causal relation to the ones in
the earlier moment. If a body continues to have a certain attribute
from one moment to the next, then God creates two identical accidents
inhering in that body in each of the two subsequent moments. Movement
and development generate when God decides to change the arrangement of
the moment before. A ball is moved, for instance, when in the second
moment of two the atoms of the ball happen to be created in a certain
distance from the first. The distance determines the speed of the
movement. The ball thus jumps in leaps over the playing field and the
same is true for the players&rsquo; limbs and their bodies. This also
applies to the atoms of the air if there happen to be some wind. In
every moment, God re-arranges all the atoms of this world anew and He
creates new accidents&mdash;thus creating a new world every moment
(Perler/Rudolph 2000, 28&ndash;62).</p>

<p>
All Ash&#703;arite theologians up to the generation of
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&mdash;including his teacher
al-Juwayn&#299;&mdash;subscribed to the occasionalist ontology
developed by al-Ash&#703;ar&#299;. One of al-Juwayn&#299;&rsquo;s late
works, the <em>Creed for Ni&#7827;&#257;m al-Mulk</em>
(<em>al-&#703;Aq&#299;da al-Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya</em>), shows,
however, that he already explored different ontological models,
particularly with regard to the effects of human actions
(al-Juwayn&#299; 1948, 30&ndash;36; Gimaret 1980, 122&ndash;28). A
purely occasionalist model finds it difficult to explain how God can
make humans responsible for their own actions if they do not cause
them. As a viable alternative to the occasionalist ontology,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; considered the Avicennan model of secondary
causes. When God wishes to create a certain event He employs some of
His own creations as mediators or &ldquo;secondary causes.&rdquo; God
creates series of efficient causes where any superior element causes
the existence of the inferior ones. Avicenna stresses that no causal
series, in any of the four types of causes, can regress indefinitely.
Every series of causes and effects must have at least three
components: a first element, a middle element, and a last element. In
such a chain only the first element is the cause in the real sense of
the word (<em>&#703;illa mu&#7789;laqa</em>) of all subsequent
elements. It causes the last element of that chain&mdash;the ultimate
effect&mdash;through one or many intermediaries (singl.
<em>mutawassa&#7789;</em>), which are the middle elements of the
chain. Looking at a chain of efficient causes, the &ldquo;finiteness
of the causes&rdquo; (<em>tan&#257;h&#299; l-&#703;ilal</em>) serves
for Avicenna as the basis of a proof of God&rsquo;s existence. Tracing
back all efficient causes in the universe will lead to a first
efficient cause, which is itself uncaused. When the First Cause is
also shown to be incorporeal and numerically one, one has achieved a
proof of God&rsquo;s existence (Avicenna 2005, 257&ndash;9,
270&ndash;3; Davidson 1987, 339&ndash;40).</p>

<h3><a id="17tDisInc">7.2 The 17th Discussion of the <em>Incoherence</em></a></h3>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; offers a brief yet very comprehensive examination
of causality within the 17th discussion of his <em>Incoherence of the
Philosophers</em>. The 17th discussion is not triggered by any
opposition to causality. Rather it aims at forcing
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s adversaries, the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>,
to acknowledge that all prophetical miracles that are reported in the
Qur&rsquo;an are possible. If their possibility is acknowledged, a
Muslim philosopher who accepts the authority of revelation must also
admit that the prophets performed these miracles and that the
narrative in revelation is truthful. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; divides the
17th discussion into four different sections. He presents three
different &ldquo;positions&rdquo; (singl. <em>maq&#257;m</em>) of his
(various) opponents and addresses them one by one. His response to the
&ldquo;second position&rdquo;, which is that of Avicenna, is further
divided into two different &ldquo;approaches&rdquo; (singl<em>.
maslak</em>). This four-fold division of the 17th discussion is
crucial for its understanding. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; addresses
different concepts about causality within the different discussions
and develops not one, but at least two coherent responses.</p>

<p>
For a detailed discussion of the four parts in the 17th discussion the
reader must be referred to chapter 6 in Griffel 2009 (147&ndash;73).
The following pages give only an outline of
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s overall argument. In the opening sentence
of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; introduces the position he
wishes to refute and he lines out elements that alternative
explanations of causality must include in order to be acceptable for
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;. This opening statement is a masterwork of
philosophical literature:</p>

<blockquote>
The connection (<em>iqtir&#257;n</em>) between what is habitually
believed to be a cause and what is habitually believed to be an effect
is not necessary (<em>&#7693;ar&#363;r&#299;</em>), according to us.
But [with] any two things [that are not identical and that do not
imply one another] (&hellip;) it is not necessary that the existence
or the nonexistence of one follows necessarily (<em>min
&#7693;ar&#363;ra</em>) from the existence or the nonexistence of the
other (&hellip;). Their connection is due to the prior decision
(<em>taqd&#299;r</em>) of God, who creates them side by side
(<em>&#703;al&#257; l-tas&#257;wuq</em>), not to its being necessary
by itself, incapable of separation. (al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a, 166)
</blockquote>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; lays out four conditions that any explanation of
physical processes that is acceptable to him must fulfill: (1) the
connection between a cause and its effect is not necessary, (2) the
effect can come to exist without this particular cause (&ldquo;they
are not incapable of separation&rdquo;), (3) God creates two events
concomitant, side by side, and (4) God&rsquo;s creation follows a
prior decision (<em>taqd&#299;r</em>). On first sight, it seems that
only an occasionalist explanation of physical processes would fulfill
these four conditions, and this is how this statement has mostly been
understood. Rudolph (in Perler/Rudolph 2000, 75&ndash;77), however,
pointed out that not only occasionalism but other types of
explanations also fulfill these four criteria. Most misleading is the
third requirement that God would need to create events &ldquo;side by
side.&rdquo; These words seem to point exclusively to an occasionalist
understanding of creation. One should keep in mind, however, that this
formula leaves open, <em>how</em> God creates events. Even an
Avicennan philosopher holds that God creates the cause concomitant to
its effect, and does so by means of secondary causality. While the
17th discussion of al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Incoherence</em>
points towards occasionalism as a possible solution, it also points to
others. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; chooses a certain linguistic association
to occasionalism, which has led many interpreters of this discussion
to believe that here, he argues exclusively in favor of it.</p>

<p>
It is important to understand that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; does not deny
the existence of a connection between a cause and its effect; rather
he denies the necessary character of this connection. In the First
Position of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; brings the
argument that observation cannot prove causal connections. Observation
can only conclude that the cause and its effect occur
concomitantly:</p>

<blockquote>
Observation (<em>mush&#257;hada</em>) points towards a concomitant
occurrence (<em>al-hus&ucirc;l &lsquo;indahu</em>) but not to a
combined occurrence (<em>al-hu&#7779;&#363;l bih&#299;</em>) and that
there is no other cause (<em>&#703;illa</em>) for it.
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a, 167.)
</blockquote>

<p>
It would be wrong, however, to conclude from this argument that
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; denied the existence of causal connections. While
such connections cannot be proven through observation (or through any
other means), they may or may not exist. In the First Position
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; rejects the view that the connection between an
efficient cause and its effect is simply necessary <em>per se</em>,
meaning that the proximate cause alone is fully responsible for the
effect and that nothing else is also necessary for the effect to
occur. In another work this position is described as one held by
&ldquo;materialists&rdquo; (<em>dahriyy&#363;n</em>) who deny that the
world has a cause or a maker (al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1959a, 19 = 2000b,
61). The Mu&#703;tazilite view of <em>tawallud</em>, meaning that
humans are the sole creators of their own actions and their immediate
effects, also falls under this position (al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000,
226.13&ndash;14). Like in the connection between a father and his son,
where the father is not the <em>only</em> efficient cause for the
son&rsquo;s existence, so there may be in every causal connection
efficient causes involved other than the most obvious or the most
proximate one. The proximate efficient cause may be just the last
element in a long chain of efficient causes that extends via the
heavenly realm. The intellects of the celestial spheres, which were
thought to be referred to in revelation as &ldquo;angels,&rdquo; may
be middle elements or intermediaries in causal chains that all have
its beginning in God. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; rejects the position of the
materialists and the Mu&rsquo;tazilites because it does not take
account of the fact that God is the ultimate efficient cause of the
observed effect. God may create this effect directly or by way of
secondary causality. Discussing the example that when fire touches a
ball of cotton it causes it to combust, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; writes
about the First Position that the fire <em>alone</em> causes
combustion:</p>

<blockquote>
This [position] is one of those that we deny. Rather we say that the
efficient cause (<em>f&#257;&#703;il</em>) of the combustion through
the creation of blackness in the cotton and through causing the
separation of its parts and turning it into coal or ashes is
God&mdash;either through the mediation of the angels or without
mediation. (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a, 167.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Secondary causality is a viable option for al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; that
he is willing to accept. Still he does not accept the teachings of
Avicenna, which are discussed in the Second Position. Avicenna
combines secondary causality with the view that causal processes
proceed with necessity and in accord with the natures of things, and
not by way of deliberation and choice on the side of the efficient
cause. The ultimate efficient cause in a cosmology of secondary
causality is, of course, God. The Avicennan opponent of the Second
Position teaches secondary causality <em>plus</em> he holds that the
causal connections follow with necessity from the essence of the First
Being. They are not created through God&rsquo;s deliberation and
choice but are a necessary effect of God&rsquo;s essence.</p>

<h3><a id="TwoDifConMod">7.3 Two Different Concepts of the Modalities</a></h3>

<p>
When al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; writes that the connection between a cause
and its effect is not necessary he attacks Avicenna&rsquo;s
necessitarian ontology not his secondary causality. The dispute
between al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; and Avicenna is not about causality as
such, rather about the necessary nature of God&rsquo;s creation.
Kukkonen (2000) and Dutton (2001) have shown that the two start with
quite different assumptions about necessity. Avicenna&rsquo;s view of
the modalities follows the statistical model of Aristotle and connects
the possibility of a thing to its temporal actuality (B&auml;ck 1992).
A temporally unqualified sentence like, &ldquo;Fire causes cotton to
combust,&rdquo; contains implicitly or explicitly a reference to the
time of utterance as part of its meaning. If this sentence is true
whenever uttered, it is necessarily true. If its truth-value can
change in the course of time, it is possible. If such a sentence is
false whenever uttered, it is impossible (Hintikka 1973, 63&ndash;72,
84&ndash;6, 103&ndash;5, 149&ndash;53). In Aristotelian modal
theories, modal terms were taken to refer to the one and only
historical world of ours. For Avicenna, fire necessarily causes cotton
to combust because the sentence &ldquo;Fire causes cotton to
combust,&rdquo; was, is, and will always be true.</p>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s understanding of the modalities developed
in the context of Ash&#703;arite <em>kal&#257;m</em> and does not
share the statistical model of Aristotle and Avicenna. Ash&#703;arite
<em>kal&#257;m</em> developed an understanding that is closer to our
modern view of the modalities as referring to synchronic alternative
states of affairs. In the modern model, the notion of necessity refers
to what obtains in all alternatives, the notion of possibility refers
to what obtains in at least in one alternative, and that which is
impossible does not obtain in any conceivable state of affairs
(Knuuttila 1998, 145). Ash&#703;arite <em>kal&#257;m</em> pursued the
notion that God is the particularizing agent
(<em>mukha&#7779;&#7779;i&#7779;</em>) of all events in the world, who
determines, for instance, when things come into existence and when
they fall out of existence (Davidson 1987, 159&ndash;61,
176&ndash;80). The idea of particularization
(<em>takh&#7779;&#299;&#7779;</em>) includes implicitly an
understanding of possible worlds that are different from this. The
process of particularization makes one of several alternatives actual.
In his <em>Creed for Ni&#7827;&#257;m al-Mulk</em>, al-Juwayn&#299;
explains the Ash&#703;arite understanding of the modalities. Every
sound thinking person finds within herself, &ldquo;the knowledge about
the possibility of what is possible, the necessity of what is
necessary, and the impossibility of what is impossible&rdquo;
(al-Juwayn&#299; 1948, 8&ndash;9). We know this distinction
instinctively without learning it from others and without further
inquiry into the world. It is an impulse (<em>bad&#299;ha</em>) in our
rational judgment (<em>&#703;aql</em>). Al-Juwayn&#299; explains this
impulse:</p>

<blockquote>
The impulsive possibility that the intellect rushes to apprehend
without [any] consideration, thinking, or inquiry is what becomes
evident to the intelligent person when he sees a building. [The
building] is a possibility that comes into being (<em>min jaw&#257;z
&#7717;ud&#363;thih&#299;</em>). The person knows decisively and
offhand that the actual state (<em>&#7717;ud&#363;th</em>) of that
building is from among its possible states
(<em>j&#257;&#702;iz&#257;t</em>) and that it is not impossible in the
intellect had it not been built. (al-Juwayn&#299; 1948, 9)
</blockquote>

<p>
The intelligent person (<em>al-&#703;&#257;qil</em>)&mdash;here simply
meaning a person with full rational capacity&mdash;realizes that all
the features of the building, its height, its length, its form, etc.,
are actualized possibilities and could be different. The same applies
to the time when the building is built. We immediately realize,
al-Juwayn&#299; says, that there is a synchronic alternative state to
the actual building. This is what we call possibility or more
precisely contingency (<em>imk&#257;n</em>). Realizing that there is
such an alternative is an important part of our understanding:
&ldquo;The intelligent person cannot realize in his mind anything
about the states of the building without comparing it with what is
contingent like it (<em>imk&#257;n mithlih&#299;</em>) or what is
different from it (<em>khil&#257;fih&#299;</em>).&rdquo;
(al-Juwayn&#299; 1948, 9.)</p>

<p>
In at least three passages of the <em>Incoherence</em>
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; criticizes Avicenna&rsquo;s understanding of the
modalities. Here he refers to another, closely related dispute, namely
that for Avicenna the modalities exist in reality while for
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; they exist only as judgments in the minds of
humans (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000, 42.2&ndash;5, 124.10&ndash;11,
207.4&ndash;14). He denies Avicenna&rsquo;s premise that possibility
needs a substrate. This premise is Aristotelian&mdash;it is the basis
to the principle of entelechy, namely that all things have
potentialities and are driven to actualize them (Dutton 2001,
26&ndash;7) Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; shifts, as Kukkonen (2000,
488&ndash;9) puts it, the locus of the presumption of a thing&rsquo;s
actual existence from the plane of the actualized reality to the plane
of mental conceivability.</p>

<p>
When al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; says that &ldquo;according to us&rdquo; the
connection between the efficient cause and its effect is not
necessary, he aims to point out that the connection <em>could</em> be
different even if it never will be different. For Avicenna, the fact
that the connection never was different and never will be different
implies that it is necessary. Nowhere in his works requires
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; that any given causal connection was different or
will be different in order to be considered not necessary. We will see
that he, like Avicenna, assumes causal connections never were and
never will be different from what they are now. Still they are not
necessary, he maintains. The connection between a cause and its effect
is contingent (<em>mumkin</em>) because an alternative to it is
conceivable in our minds. We can imagine a world where fire does not
cause cotton to combust. Or, to continue reading the initial statement
of the 17th discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
(&hellip;) it is within divine power to create satiety without eating,
to create death without a deep cut (<em>&#7717;a&#7827;&#7827;</em>)
in the neck, to continue life after having received a deep cut in the
neck, and so on to all connected things. The <em>fal&#257;sifa</em>
deny the possibility of [this] and claim it to be impossible.
(Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a, 166.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, a world where fire doesn&rsquo;t cause combustion in cotton
would be radically different from the one we live in. A change in a
single causal connection would probably imply that many others would
be different as well. Still, such a world can be conceived in our
minds, which means it is a possible world. God, however, did not
choose to create such an alternative possible world (Griffel 2009,
172&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
In the initial statement of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
claims that &ldquo;the connection [between cause and effect] is due to
the prior decision (<em>taqd&#299;r</em>) of God.&rdquo; When he
objects to Avicenna that these connections are not necessary,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; wishes to point out that God could have chosen to
create an alternative world where the causal connections are different
from what they are. Avicenna denied this. This world is the necessary
effect of God&rsquo;s nature and a world different from this one is
unconceivable. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; objects and says this world is the
contingent effect of God&rsquo;s free will and His deliberate choice
between alternative worlds.</p>

<h3><a id="CumPosOccSecCau">7.4 The Cum-Possibility of Occasionalism and Secondary Causality</a></h3>

<p>
In the Second Position of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
presents two different &ldquo;approaches&rdquo; (singl.
<em>maslak</em>) in order to counter Avicenna&rsquo;s position that
the necessary connection between existing causes and effects renders
some miracles in the Qur&rsquo;an impossible. In the First Approach
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; denies the existence of &ldquo;natures&rdquo;
(<em>&#7789;ab&#257;&#702;i&#703;</em>) and of causal connections and
maintains that God creates every event immediately. This is the part
of the 17th discussion where he presents occasionalism as a viable
explanation of what we have usually come to refer as efficient
causality. God&rsquo;s eternal and unchanging knowledge already
contains all events that will happen in creation. By creating
combustion every time fire touches cotton, God follows a certain
custom (<em>&#703;&#257;da</em>). In real terms, however, combustion
occurs only concomitantly when fire touches cotton and is not
connected to this event. In the First Approach of the Second Position
in the 17th discussion (al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a,
169.14&ndash;171.11) and in some of his later works
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1962), he maintains that causal processes may
simply be the result of God&rsquo;s habit and that He creates what we
consider a cause and its effect individually and immediately. When God
wishes to perform a miracle and confirm the mission of one of His
prophets, he suspends His habit and omits to create the effect He
usually does according to His habit.</p>

<p>
The Second Approach (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 2000a, 171.12&ndash;174.8)
presents a very different explanation of prophetical miracles. Marmura
(1981) called it &ldquo;al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s second causal
theory.&rdquo; Here al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; accepts the existence of
&ldquo;natures&rdquo; (<em>&#7789;ab&#257;&#702;i&#703;</em>) and of
unchanging connections between causes and their effects. In the second
causal theory al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; merely points out that despite
human efforts in the natural sciences, we are far away from knowing
all causes and explaining all processes in nature. It may well be the
case that those miracles that the <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> deny have
immanent natural causes that are unknown to us. When Moses, for
instance, threw his stick to the ground and it changed into a serpent
(Qur&rsquo;an, 7.107, 20.69, 26.32) the material of the wooden stick
may have undergone a rapid transformation and become a living animal.
We know that wood disintegrates with time and becomes earth that
fertilizes and feeds plants. These plants are, in turn, the fodder of
herbivores, which are consumed by carnivores like snakes. The
<em>fal&#257;sifa</em> cannot exclude that some unknown cause acts as
a catalyst and may rapidly expedite the usually slow process where the
matter of a wooden stick is transformed into a snake. These and other
explanations given in the Second Approach are only examples of how the
prophetical miracles may be the result of natural causes that are not
fully understood by humans.</p>

<p>
Marmura (1965, 183; 1981, 97) rejected the suggestion that
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; might have held occasionalism <em>and</em>
secondary causality as two cum-possible cosmological explanations.
Marmura conceded that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; makes use of causalist
language &ldquo;sometimes in the way it is used in ordinary Arabic,
sometimes in a more specifically Avicennian / Aristotelian way&rdquo;
and that this usage of language is innovative for the Ash&#703;arite
school discourse (1995, 89). Yet in all major points of Muslim
theology al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; held positions that follow closely the
ones developed by earlier Ash&#703;arite scholars, namely the
possibility of miracles, the creation of humans acts, and God&rsquo;s
freedom during the creation of the universe (1995, 91, 93&ndash;97,
99&ndash;100). In Marmura&rsquo;s view, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; never
deviated from occasionalism, while he sometimes expressed his opinions
in ambiguous language that mocked philosophical parlance, probably in
order to lure followers of <em>fals&#257;fa</em> into the
Ash&#703;arite occasionalist camp.</p>

<p>
More recent literature assumes that al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; considered
occasionalism and secondary causality as cum-possible explanations of
God&rsquo;s creative activity (Griffel 2009, 147&ndash;73; Moad 2023,
281&ndash;310) They base their conclusion, among others, on a passage
in the 20th discussion of the <em>Incoherence</em> on the subject of
corporeal resurrection in the afterlife (Griffel 2009, 178&ndash;79;
Moad 2023, 249). The <em>fal&#257;sifa</em> argue that corporeal
resurrection is impossible because it requires the transformation of
substances like iron into a garment, which is impossible. In his
response, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; refers to the Second Approach of the
Second Position in the 17th discussion where, he says, he had already
discussed this problem. He argues that the unusually rapid recycling
of the matter that makes up the piece of iron into a piece of garment
is not impossible. &ldquo;But this is not the point at issue
here,&rdquo; al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; says. The real question is whether
such a transformation &ldquo;occurs purely through [divine] power
without an intermediary, or through one of the causes.&rdquo; He
continues:</p>

<blockquote>
Both these two views are possible for us (<em>kil&#257;hum&#257;
mumkin&#257;n &#703;indan&#257;</em>) (&hellip;) [In the 17th
discussion we stated] that the connection of connected things in
existence is not by way of necessity but through habitual events,
which can be disrupted. Thus, these events come about through the
power of God without the existence of their causes. The second [view]
is that we say: This is due to causes, but it is not a condition that
the cause [here] would be one that is well-known
(<em>ma&#703;h&#363;d</em>). Rather, in the treasury of things that
are enacted by [God&rsquo;s] power there are wondrous and strange
things that one hasn&rsquo;t come across. These are denied by someone
who thinks that only those things exists that he experiences similar
to people who deny magic, sorcery, the talismanic arts, [prophetic]
miracles, and the wondrous deeds [done by saints]. (Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
2000a, 222.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; maintained this undecided position throughout his
lifetime. Given the fact that neither observation nor any other means
of knowing (including revelation) gives a decisive proof for the
existence or non-existence of a connection between a cause and its
effect, we must suspend our judgment on this matter. God may create
through the mediation of causes that He employs, or directly without
such mediation. This undecided position is unfortunately nowhere
clearly explained. It can be gathered from isolated statements like
the one above and the fact that after the <em>Incoherence</em>
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; wrote books where he maintained a distinctly
occasionalist cosmology (Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1962) and others like the
35th book of his <em>Revival</em> or the <em>Niche of Lights</em>,
where he uses language that is explicitly causalist. In none of these
books, however, he commits himself to the position that the cause is
connected to its effect. God may create the two independently from one
another or He may create them through the mediation of secondary
causes. In his very last work, completed only days before his death,
al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; discusses whether God creates &ldquo;through the
mediation&rdquo; (<em>bi-w&#257;si&#7789;a</em>) of his creations or
not, and maintains that the matter cannot be settled decisively
(al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; 1985, 68&ndash;69).</p>

<p>
In all this al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; accepted the unchanging character of
this creation. Once God chose to create this world among alternatives,
He also chose not to change the rules that govern it. While it is
conceivable and therefore possible that God would break his habit or
intervene in the assigned function of the secondary causes, He informs
us in His revelation that He will not do so. In the 31st book of his
<em>Revival</em>, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; says that God creates all
things one after the other in an orderly manner. After making clear
that this order represents God&rsquo;s habit (<em>sunna</em>), he
quotes the Qur&rsquo;an (33:62 and 48:23): &ldquo;You will not find
any change in God&rsquo;s habit.&rdquo; (Ghaz&#257;l&#299;
1937&ndash;38, 11:2084&ndash;85.) This verse is quoted several times
in the <em>Revival</em>; in one passage al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; adds that
we should not think God will ever change His habit (ibid, 4:12).
Prophetical miracles are merely extraordinary occurrences that take
place within the system of the strictly habitual operation of
God&rsquo;s actions or within the &ldquo;natural laws&rdquo; that
govern the secondary causes. Miracles are programmed into God&rsquo;s
plan for His creation, so to speak, from the very beginning and do not
represent a direct intervention or a suspension of God&rsquo;s lawful
actions (Frank 1992, 59; idem, 1994, 20). Given that there will never
be a break in God&rsquo;s habit, an occasionalist universe will always
remain indistinguishable from one governed by secondary causality.</p>
