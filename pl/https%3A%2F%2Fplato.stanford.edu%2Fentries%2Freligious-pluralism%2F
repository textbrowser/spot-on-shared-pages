<h1>Religious Diversity (Pluralism)</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 25, 2004; substantive revision Fri Feb 21, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
In many, if not most, areas of thought, significant differences of
opinion exist among individuals who seem to be equally knowledgeable
and sincere. Such diversity of opinion, though, is nowhere more
evident than in the area of religious thought. On almost every
religious issue, individuals who seem to have equal access to the
relevant information and be equally truth-seeking hold significantly
diverse, often incompatible beliefs.</p>

<p>
Religious diversity of this sort can be fruitfully explored in many
ways &mdash;for instance, from psychological, anthropological, or
historical perspectives. The current discussion, however, will concern
itself primarily some key issues surrounding religious diversity with
which philosophers are most concerned at present. Specifically, our
discussion will focus primarily on the following questions: How
pervasive is religious diversity? Does the reality of such diversity
require a response? Can a person who acknowledges religious diversity
remain justified in claiming just one perspective to be correct? Can
acknowledged religious diversity lead to religious tolerance? Can it
justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path into the
eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be approached
in public education? The answers to such questions are not simply
academic; they have an increasingly practical impact on how we treat
others, both personally and corporately.</p>

<p>
The main goal of this discussion, it is important to note, is not to
support a given stance on these issues. It is to clarify the issues
and explore differing perspectives.</p>

<h2 id="FocuShapDisc">1. The Focus and Scope of the Discussion</h2>

<p>
Some prominent philosophers of religion are critical of the fact that
the main focus of most philosophical discussions of religion,
including discussions of religious diversity, is on theistic rather
than non-theistic religions. John Schellenberg, for instance, has
recently argued that &ldquo;philosophy of religion should incorporate
nontheistic conceptions of God in the context of the <em>much larger
set of topics</em> that philosophers of religion should be
investigating&rdquo; (Schellenberg 2024, 34). While I&rsquo;m
sensitive to this concern, the focus of this discussion will remain,
as it currently does for the majority of analytic philosophers of
religion, on theistic religions. Monotheistic religions such as
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam agree that there is a sole God, while
polytheistic religions such as Taoism, Japanese Shinto, and Chinese
folk religion hold that there are multiple deities (gods). Much of
what follows applies to any theistic religion. The main focus,
however, will be on the diversity issues that arise predominately in
those religions that believe in a sole personal Supreme Being
(God).</p>

<p>
Even in relation to theistic religions, Schellenberg and others are
concerned with the continuing prominence and influence of classical
Christianity. To counter this, Schellenberg argues, &ldquo;we need new
work to broaden what today is called Christian philosophy into
something that might credibly be called the philosophy of
Christianity, by rigorously developing both arguments favouring
classical Christian doctrine <em>and arguments opposing it</em>&rdquo;
as by doing so &ldquo;we may succeed in unsettling the current
consensus, awakening many from their dogmatic slumbers, and thus
change the Christian climate of our field sufficiently to allow a
great many new ideas about religion to be exposed and receive the
attention they deserve&rdquo; (Schellenberg 2024, 40). While the
general arguments and concepts discussed below are not primarily
focused on Christianity, the majority of the clarifying examples come
from Christian (and to a lesser extent Muslim) sources.</p>

<p>
Victoria Harrison maintains that we need a more global approach to the
philosophy of religion. For this to occur, she argues, we need more
than simply &ldquo;expanding [philosophy of religion&rsquo;s]
traditional disciplinary scope or broadening its range of
questions.&rdquo; It will require that we have philosophers
&ldquo;conversant in more than one philosophical tradition&rdquo; as
this will provide a &ldquo;platform for deep and authentic engagement
in philosophical inquiry that crosses traditional religious and
philosophical boundaries&rdquo; (Harrison 2020, 20). While thre is
clear value to a more global approach to the philosophy of religion in
general and to religious diversity in particular, the discussion that
follows focuses primarily, but not solely, on the key diversity
questions currently under discussion in Western analytic philosophy of
religion.</p>

<p>
Mikel Burley fears that current philosophy of religion focuses too
narrowly on general abstract concepts of the divine at the expense of
downplaying &ldquo;the particularities of historically and
geographically distinct conceptions of God&rdquo; in actual lived
religions (Burley 2024, 98). While there is a valid distinction
between focusing on the specific perspectives of various actual
religions on issues and focusing on issues that are relevant to many
actual religious perspectives, with examples from specific religions,
the focus of this discussion is on the latter.</p>

<p>
Finally, although there is obviously widespread diversity of thought
<em>among</em> monotheistic religions (theistic systems) on such core
issues as God&rsquo;s nature and character, the relationship between
divine control and human freedom, the extent to which God unilaterally
intervenes in our world, and how God would have us live, it is
becoming increasingly recognized that widespread diversity of thought
on all such issues also exists just as clearly, and in exactly the
same sense, <em>within</em> basic theistic systems. For example,
within Christianity, believers differ significantly on the nature of
God. Some see God as all-controlling, others as self-limiting, and
still others as incapable of unilaterally controlling any aspect of
reality. Some believe God to have infallible knowledge only of all
that has occurred or is occurring; others claim God also has knowledge
of all that will actually occur, while those who believe God possesses
middle knowledge add that God knows all that would actually occur in
any possible context. Some believe the moral principles stipulated by
God for correct human behavior flow from God&rsquo;s nature or
character and thus that such principles determine God&rsquo;s
behavior, while others believe that God acts in accordance with a
different set of moral rules than the moral rules given to humans:
that for God what is right is simply whatever God does. Some believe
that only those who have consciously &ldquo;given their lives to
Christ&rdquo; will spend eternity in God&rsquo;s presence. Others
believe that many who have never even heard the name of Jesus will
enter God&rsquo;s presence, while others do not even believe
subjective immortality (a conscious afterlife) to be a reality.</p>

<p>
Muslims also differ significantly among themselves on these same
divine attributes, the autonomy of the individual when interpreting
the Qur&rsquo;an, how best to apply core Islamic values to modern
life, and the status of women (Aijaz 2015). We find equally pervasive,
significant intra-system diversity in Hinduism (Burley 2024) and
Judaism (Shatz 2011).</p>

<p>
It is also important to note that the perspective of a variant of a
given religion on an issue (for example, the perspective of
conservative Christians on God&rsquo;s power and human freedom or the
role of women) is often more closely aligned with the perspective of
variants of differing religions on that issue (for example, the
perspectives of conservative Muslims or conservative Jews on human
freedom or the role of women) than with the perspective of other
variants within the same religion (Basinger 2023, 6).</p>

<p>
Both inter-religious and intra-religious diversity will receive
attention in what follows.</p>

<h2 id="PossRespReliDive">2. Responses to Religious Diversity</h2>

<p>
Philosophical/theological responses to religious diversity are
normally divided into three categories: religious exclusivism,
religious inclusivism, and religious pluralism. However, there is not
always agreement on the meaning of these categorizing terms. For our
purposes, they will be defined as follows.</p>

<p>
Individuals are religious exclusivists when they believe that their
perspective on some disputed inter-theistic truth claim&mdash;for
example, that Allah is the true God&mdash;or some disputed
intra-theistic truth claim&mdash;for example, that the Christian God
cannot control free human choice&mdash;is the truth or at least closer
to the truth than any other competing religious perspective on this
 issue.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 But even here, there is an important distinction to be made. As Guy
Axtell rightly points out, one can be a &ldquo;particularist
exclusivist&rdquo; who holds that only one of a number of perspectives
on a given issue can be uniquely true and no one can justifiably
maintain otherwise or a &ldquo;mutualist exclusivist&rdquo; who holds
that while it can justifiably be maintained that only one perspective
on a given issue is uniquely true, those holding differing
perspectives can also justifiably claim that these perspectives are
uniquely true (Axtell 2020). While Axtell, himself, does not believe
mutualist exclusivism to be coherent, others such as Dirk-Martin Grube
maintain not only that mutual exclusivism &mdash;couching discussions
of exclusivism in terms of justified belief rather than bivalent
truth&mdash;is coherent but also productive for inter-religious dialog
(Grube 2019).</p>

<p>
Individuals are religious inclusivists in the most general sense when
they hold to the primacy of one religion but the validity of other
religions. That is, inclusivists maintain that while their own
religious perspectives are the fullest (most complete and accurate)
understanding of ultimate reality, the perspectives of other religions
contain a partially complete and accurate understanding of ultimate
reality, including genuine, albeit incomplete, experiences of the
divine. However, as will be discussed in Section 6, while all
inclusivists agree that those who are not adherents to the one fully
true religion can attain salvation, some maintain that only the one
true religion can offer a valid path to eternal presence with God
(Pinnock 1992) while others do not (Rahner 1966).</p>

<p>
Individuals are religious pluralists when they deny the primacy of any
one religion. Those sometimes labeled philosophical (or metaphysical
or unitary) religious pluralists maintain that there is an ultimate
reality and that various religions offer incomplete understandings of
this reality. Accordingly, the religious perspectives of more than one
basic theistic system or variant thereof can justifiably be considered
equally close to the truth (Hick 2004). A key goal of these pluralists
is to identify those aspects of this ultimate reality to which the
various religions imperfectly point (Hick 2004). Those sometimes
labeled radical religious pluralists maintain that differing religions
are ultimately irreducibly diverse and, thus, reject the attempt to
identify a unified ultimate reality or shared ethical framework and
instead encourage a focus on the differing aspects rather than the
shared commonality of the various religions (Heim 1995; Runzo
2011).</p>

<h2 id="ReliDiveEpisObli">3. Religious Diversity and Epistemic Obligation</h2>

<p>
No philosopher denies that the awareness (realization) of seeming
religious diversity does at times have an impact on
exclusivists&mdash;from causing minor uneasiness to significantly
reducing their level of confidence in the truth of certain beliefs to
precipitating belief abandonment. This is simply an empirical claim
about psychological states and behaviors (Alston 1988, 442&ndash;446;
Plantinga 2000, 189).</p>

<p>
How should, though, exclusivists coming to an awareness of religious
diversity&mdash;the awareness that seemingly sincere, knowledgeable
individuals differ with them on issues of religious
significance&mdash;respond to the reality of such diversity? How
should, for instance, the devout Hindu or Christian who comes to
realize that those of other religions who seem as knowledgeable and
devout hold incompatible religious perspectives on the nature of the
divine respond? Or how should a Christian who believes the Bible
clearly portrays a God with total control over all aspects of reality
respond to the realization that other seemingly sincere, devout,
&ldquo;Bible-believing&rdquo; Christians see the Bible as clearly
portraying a God who has chosen not to control what occurs in those
contexts in which humans have been granted meaningful moral freedom?
Can exclusivists justifiably disregard such diversity, or do
exclusivists have an obligation to attempt to resolve such epistemic
conflicts &ndash; engage in belief assessment (or reassessment) with
openness to possible revision? Would it at least be a good idea to do
so?</p>

<p>
Before discussing these questions, we must note two challenges to any
form of epistemic obligation in this context. First, there are
religious individuals (and groups) who believe it is inappropriate to
subject religious beliefs to rational assessment of any sort. Certain
individuals (sometimes called fideists) have argued, for instance,
that religious beliefs are not of a type properly subjected to
rational assessment and/or that assessing such beliefs demonstrates a
lack of faith (Peterson et al. 2013, 65&ndash;69). However, few
philosophers currently hold this position. Most maintain that
exclusivists have at least the right to assess their beliefs in the
face of religious diversity.</p>

<p>
Second, we must consider the argument, put forth most forcefully by
Alvin Plantinga, that the discussion of any form of epistemic
obligation faced by exclusivists in response to seeming peer conflict
on religious issues is based on a faulty premise: that the exclusivist
must acknowledge that peer conflict of the type in question actually
exists.</p>

<p>
Plantinga acknowledges that if proponents of a specific religious
perspective have no reason to doubt that those with whom they disagree
really are on equal epistemic footing, then they are under a prima
facie obligation to attempt to resolve the conflict. However,
Plantinga denies that Christian exclusivists need ever acknowledge
that they are facing true epistemic parity&mdash;need ever admit that
they actually are differing with true epistemic peers. Although
Christian exclusivists, we are told, may grant that those with whom
they disagree have not violated any epistemic duty and may know of no
arguments that would convince others of their wrongness while
maintaining their rightness, exclusivists are likely to believe that
they have in some way been epistemically favored. They might believe,
for instance, that they have been graced by &ldquo;the Internal
Witness of the Holy Spirit; or perhaps [they] think the Holy Spirit
preserves the Christian church from serious error, at least with
respect to the fundamentals of Christian belief; or perhaps [they
think] that [they have] been converted by divine grace, so that [they]
now see what was once obscure to [them]&mdash;a blessing not so far
bestowed upon the dissenters&rdquo; (Plantinga 1997, 296).</p>

<p>
Moreover, if any beliefs of this type are true, Plantinga contends,
then Christian exclusivists are probably in a better epistemic
position, than those who reject the exclusivistic beliefs in question.
Therefore, since it cannot be demonstrated that Christian belief of
this sort is very likely false, Christian believers remain justified
in maintaining that the proponents of other religious perspectives are
not actually on an equal epistemic footing. The same, Plantinga
acknowledges, might well be true for exclusivists in other religious
belief systems (Plantinga 1997,
 296).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The strength of this line of reasoning depends in part on the
debatable question of who shoulders the burden of proof in the face of
religious diversity. Those siding with Plantinga argue in essence that
unless exclusivists must acknowledge on epistemic grounds that are (or
should be) accepted by all rational people that those holding
incompatible beliefs are actually on equal footing, exclusivists can
justifiably deny that this is so and thus need not engage in belief
assessment (Kim 2011). Dissenters argue that exclusivists are the ones
who shoulder the burden of proof. Unless it can be demonstrated on
epistemic grounds that are (or should be) accepted by all rational
people that proponents of the competing perspectives are not actually
on equal epistemic footing, exclusivists must consider their
challengers on equal epistemic footing and are thus obligated to
engage in belief assessment (Basinger 2002, 26&ndash;27). Or, to state
this important distinction another way, Plantinga contends that we
need not acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are actually on
equal epistemic footing unless it can be demonstrated objectively that
they are equally knowledgeable and sincere, while his critics maintain
that we must acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are on equal
epistemic footing unless we have an objective means of demonstrating
that we are in fact more knowledgeable and/or sincere than they. Most
philosophers of religion side with the critics in this case and thus
assume that actual peer conflict cannot justifiably be denied
(Stenmark 2024; Byrne 2011, 30).</p>

<p>
Assuming the reality of peer conflict, some claim that exclusivists
encountering peer disputes on religious issues are required (fully
obligated) to attempt to resolve such epistemic conflicts. The
contention here, it must be emphasized, is not that such resolution is
always possible or that exclusivists must necessarily give up their
beliefs if no resolution is forthcoming. Discussion concerning those
issues is yet to come. The claim, rather, is only that exclusivists
are obligated at the very least to assess the evidence for and against
the beliefs in question and try to &ldquo;get a sense of the appeal
and of the concern of those who advocate them&rdquo; (McKim 2001,
146).</p>

<p>
Other philosophers support qualified forms of obligation in the face
of peer conflict. Dirk-Martin Grube, for example, states that
exclusivists like Plantinga tend to focus on &ldquo;the question of
whether we are justified to make exclusivist truth claims in religion
but overlook the question of how we should make those claims&rdquo;
(Grube 2024, 111). Exclusivists, he maintains, can justifiably claim
that they are entitled to hold their beliefs&mdash;can fend off
defeaters. However, such exclusivists are often guilty of being
epistemically overconfident rather than epistemically humble. When
faced with cognitive ambiguity (peer conflict in relation to religious
beliefs), exclusivists should be open to the possibility that their
judgment is mistaken and therefore be open to humbly engaging in
&ldquo;robust dialogue&rdquo; with those with whom they disagree
(Grube 2024, 121&ndash;22). The goal of such dialogue, he notes
elsewhere, is not to convert the other or even necessarily identify
areas of mutual agreement, although agreement of this sort may well
occur in some cases. The goal is to engage in a &ldquo;meaningful
exchange&rdquo; that will give exclusivists (and their challengers) a
basis for reflecting more seriously on their own perspectives (Grube
2019, 183).</p>

<p>
Mikael Stenmark affirms a more qualified sense of obligation in the
face of peer conflict. He maintains that &ldquo;when we discover that
other intelligent, well-informed, and honest people around us do not
share but even deny some of our most fundamental religious or secular
beliefs, we [must] . . . actually take into consideration the
possibility that we may be wrong&rdquo; (Stenmark 2024, 48). However,
the principle of epistemic conservatism dictates that we should
&ldquo;initially assume that what we find ourselves believing is true
until a good reason arises for us to question whether we may have made
a mistake&rdquo; (Stenmark 2024, 46). Given this principle, he
maintains, exclusivists have no overarching epistemic duty
(obligation) to always assess their current beliefs in the face of
acknowledged peer conflict, even if they must acknowledge they may be
wrong. It is only when exclusivists, themselves, find other
perspectives worthy of consideration that they have an epistemic
obligation to consider such perspectives. Given, though, that
exclusivists must acknowledge that they could be mistaken &ndash; that
there is a &ldquo;non-negligible risk&rdquo; that they are wrong
&ndash; exclusivists do have a reason (although not an obligation) to
consider the perspectives of others in relation to significant issues
(Stenmark 2024, 53).</p>

<p>
Jerome Gellman offers what can be viewed as a stronger version of
Stenmark&rsquo;s position. The focus of Gellman&rsquo;s challenge
centers on what he identifies as rock bottom beliefs. Such beliefs, as
Gellman defines them, are the epistemic givens in a religious belief
system&mdash;the assumed, foundational truths upon which all else is
built. Gellman grants that if a religious belief affirmed by an
exclusivist is not rock bottom (is not a foundational assumption),
then it may well be subject to obligatory belief assessment in the
face of religious diversity. However, he argues, since belief
assessment only makes sense when one isn&rsquo;t certain that the
belief in question is true, and since rock bottom religious beliefs
are among the foundational truths&mdash;the basic, assumed
truths&mdash;in an exclusivist&rsquo;s epistemic system, no assessment
is necessary. Rather, when exclusivists encounter a challenge to such
a belief&mdash;for example, a challenge to their rock bottom belief in
God&rsquo;s ultimate control over all earthly affairs&mdash;they can,
utilizing the G. E. Moore switch, justifiably maintain that because
their rock bottom belief is true, the competing belief can justifiably
be rejected (Gellman 1993, 345&ndash;364; Gellman 1998,
229&ndash;235).</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Gellman adds that even if we grant that rock bottom
beliefs are at times open to belief assessment, exclusivists need not
engage in such assessment in the face of religious diversity unless
they find that the awareness of such diversity is causing them to lose
significant confidence in their own perspective. In the absence of
this type of internal conflict, they &ldquo;may rationally invoke
[their] unreflective religious belief to defeat opposing religious
claims, without having to consider the question any further&rdquo;
(Gellman 2000, 403).</p>

<p>
It would seem, though, that even those who are sympathetic to
Gellman&rsquo;s general line of reasoning would want to limit its
scope. Many religious beliefs held by exclusivists have practical
consequences. That is, exclusivist beliefs are not isolated cognitive
assumptions; they motivate behavior. For instance, there are many
theists worldwide who not only still believe that men have some sort
of God-given, inherent authority over women, or that certain ethnic
groups have God-given superiority, or that certain sexual orientations
are perversions of God&rsquo;s ideal, or that humans have God-given
authority over the rest of nature, or that God desires heretics to be
silenced, they also act on these beliefs. However, it seems safe to
assume that most exclusivists, including Gellman, believe that some of
these actions are morally wrong and ought to be stopped to the extent
possible. In such cases, it is difficult to imagine many exclusivists
maintaining that those who hold the beliefs on which these acts are
based have no need to reassess these beliefs unless they personally
feel a need to do so. It seems, rather, that most exclusivists would
want those holding such beliefs to at the very least engage in
significant belief reassessment, even if they don&rsquo;t at present
personally feel a need to do so.</p>

<p>
Finally, Jennifer Jensen offers a different form of qualified
obligation to assess religious beliefs in the face of peer conflict
(Jensen 2024). Jensen grants that there are many weighty,
long-standing unresolved disagreements on foundational religious
issues&mdash;for example, on whether God exists, and if so how God is
involved in earthly affairs&mdash;with respect to which we have no
reason to deny that those on both sides are epistemic peers&mdash;to
deny that they are equally sincere, qualified, and knowledgeable.
Moreover, Jensen acknowledges that exclusivists must always consider
alleged defeaters to their religious beliefs&mdash;claims that there
are objective, non-question-begging criteria in relation to which it
can be demonstrated that a given religious belief is false or cannot
justifiably be affirmed. However, in the absence of such defeaters,
the strength of any obligation to assess disputed beliefs, we are
told, depends on the similarity of the belief systems of the
interlocutors with respect to the beliefs in question.</p>

<p>
Our beliefs, Jensen points out, do not exist in isolation. Our belief
systems (noetic structures) are composed of properly basic (core,
control) beliefs and beliefs that are layered upon these basic
beliefs. All of our religious beliefs except our core religious
beliefs are grounded in (are based upon) a set of other more deeply
ingressed (layered) beliefs. Moreover, the closer a disputed belief is
to our core beliefs, the greater the impact on our belief system as a
whole would be if it were abandoned or even held with significantly
less confidence.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, assuming that there are no defeaters to a challenged
religious belief and given that all religious beliefs except properly
basic beliefs are grounded in (are based upon) a set of other more
deeply ingressed beliefs, exclusivists are rationally justified in
retaining a challenged belief if giving up the belief would require
them to abandon their (1) properly basic beliefs, (2) any beliefs that
are more closely connected to these core beliefs than the belief being
challenged, or (3) those beliefs that are held with a greater degree
of confidence than the belief being challenged.</p>

<p>
What follows for the question of epistemic obligation in the face of
peer conflict, we are told, depends on the extent to which
exclusivists and their dissenters share the relevant set of undefeated
beliefs. The rational response to epistemic peer conflict for
exclusivists is to proportion the degree to which they are obligated
to give weight to the opinion of peer critics to the &ldquo;degree to
which [they] and [their] interlocutor share the relevant
beliefs&rdquo;&mdash;to the extent that their noetic structures
overlap (Jensen 2024, 364). More specifically, the greater the extent
to which a challenger shares the set of layered beliefs on which the
challenged belief is based, the greater the obligation to consider the
challenge. It also follows, though, that it is rational for
exclusivists to give no weight to disagreements if they &ldquo;have
good reason to believe that the relevant beliefs are not shared (or
not shared in the same way) between [them] and [those] with whom
[they] disagree&rdquo; (Jensen 2024, 368).</p>

<p>
This, of course, as Jensen acknowledges, leaves open the question of
how one determines, or the practicality of trying to determine, the
extent to which those holding differing beliefs on an issue share
overlapping belief structures. Jensen&rsquo;s approach, though, does
exemplify a growing acknowledgment of the role that non-objective
criteria can play in assessing the rationality of beliefs, which will
be discussed in greater detail in Section 4.</p>

<p>
The conclusion of this section briefly notes the relevance of current
discussions around the extent to which belief assessment that results
in belief retention, modification, or rejection is actually under our
control.</p>

<p>
When considering the extent to which the acknowledgment of diverse
perspectives on religious issues carries with it an epistemic
obligation to assess one&rsquo;s belief about those issues, there is
often the explicit or implicit assumption that such assessment is
fully or primarily a rational (cognitive) exercise. A person who is
obligated or chooses to assess challenged beliefs is to consider all
the relevant evidence in relation to an accepted method for
determining justified belief and make a rational determination to
retain, modify, or give up the belief in question. This is even so
when the valid role of non-objective criteria for belief assessment is
acknowledged. We still often find in place a model of belief
assessment that is primarily cognitive (based on conscious rational
considerations).</p>

<p>
However, to what extent is this rational assessment model accurate,
especially in relation to strongly held, deeply engrained beliefs
(including religious beliefs) that are close to the core (foundation)
of our belief systems? Social psychologists continue to maintain that
such deeply engrained beliefs are often quite resistant to
&ldquo;neutral,&rdquo; objective assessment. Whether this initial
inability to assess such beliefs in an objective fashion is primarily
the result of the manner in which the brain functions, unconscious
early childhood belief formation, and/or the unquestioned acquisition
of beliefs from respected adults, what does not seem open to debate is
that we all have person-specific beliefs related to deeply held
values, cultural norms, and/ or religious doctrines that are very
resistant to change, even in the face of seemingly strong contrary
evidence (Haidt 2012; Mercer &amp; Sperber 2011; Tappin, van der Leer,
&amp; McKay 2017).</p>

<p>
More specifically, it appears to be the case that when confronted with
criticisms of, or counter-evidence to, deeply engrained beliefs that
have emotional and/or cultural anchoring in our sense of self or the
&ldquo;world&rdquo; in which we exist, our initial conscious (or
unconscious) response is not to welcome this information and consider
how it impacts these beliefs. Rather, our default response is to avoid
the evidence, discredit the source, reinterpret the evidence, and/or
reframe the belief to absorb the counter-evidence without rejecting or
even significantly modifying the beliefs in question (Kahneman 2011).
This default desire to retain beliefs of this type in the face of
seeming counter-evidence may be a possible explanation for the fact so
few facing such counter-evidence actually give up or modify the
beliefs in question when told that rationality requires that they need
to do so based on the evidence at
 hand.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It does appear, though, that this default tendency toward
nonfalsifiabilty can be minimized when consciously acknowledged and
that belief modification can and most often does occur when
individuals face an internally generated, as opposed to an externally
imposed, sense of cognitive dissonance caused by seeming
counter-evidence to their beliefs. To the extent that this is true, it
seems that those philosophers (or others) who maintain there is some
epistemic obligation to assess religious beliefs in the face of peer
challenge and are, in addition, interested in the actualization of
this obligation must do more than simply declare to those facing peer
conflict that they have this obligation. They need to consider how
this obligation can best be shared in a way that will maximize the
likelihood that those facing diversity will experience the internal
cognitive dissonance that often serves as the precursor to meaningful
belief assessment and modification.</p>

<h2 id="ReliDiveJustBeli">4. Religious Diversity and Justified Belief</h2>

<p>
Some philosophers/theologians assume that belief assessment, when
conducted properly, can often resolve epistemic peer conflict (Byrne
2011, 31; Aijaz 2017). What if we assume, however, that while the
consideration of criteria such as self-consistency and
comprehensiveness can rule out certain options, there exists no set of
criteria that will allow us to resolve most religious epistemic
disputes (whether between proponents of different religions or
proponents of different variants of the same religion) in a neutral,
nonquestion-begging fashion (Peterson et al. 2013, 69&ndash;74)? In
what epistemic position does this then place the exclusivist?</p>

<p>
It is important that we clarify further the question being asked.
Responses to seeming epistemic peer disagreement generally fall into
one of four categories: (1) a <em>steadfast response</em> where
individuals retain their perspectives on the disputed contention with
the same degree of confidence, (2) some form of <em>conciliatory
response</em> where individuals retain their perspectives but with
reduced confidence and/or modify their perspective on the disputed
contention, (3) some form of <em>suspension of belief response</em>
where individuals have determined that they have no good reason to
favor their perspectives over the perspectives of those with whom they
disagree, and (4) some form of <em>defeatist response</em> where
individuals relinquish their perspectives.</p>

<p>
While interesting, we are not here concerned with the empirical
question of how many philosophers fall into each camp when facing peer
conflict. Nor will we be considering alleged correlations between, for
instance, a conciliatory response and virtues such as intellectual
humility and open-mindedness or a steadfast response and vices such as
intellectual arrogance or bias, although recent work in this area has
been done (Beebe &amp; Matheson 2023). We are concerned with what it
is &ldquo;rational for the disagreeing parties to believe upon
discovering their disagreement&rdquo; (Beebe &amp; Matheson 2023,
428). Or rephrased as a question for exclusivists, to what extent, if
any, is it reasonable for exclusivists to retain their exclusivistic
beliefs when it is acknowledged that epistemic peers
 disagree?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The answer, as some see it, is that exclusivists can no longer
justifiably maintain that their exclusivistic beliefs are true. John
Schellenberg, for example, argues that because no more than one among
a set of incompatible truth claims can be true, disputants in a debate
over such claims are justified in continuing to maintain that their
claim is true only if they possess nonquestion-begging justification
&mdash; justification based on assumptions and lines of reasoning
acceptable to both parties &mdash; for believing the incompatible
claim of any competitor to be false. However, since no disputant in
religious conflicts &ldquo;has justification for supposing the
others&rsquo; claims false,&rdquo; disputants cannot be justified
&ldquo;in holding [their] own claim to be true&rdquo; (Schellenberg
2000, 213). David Silver comes to a similar conclusion:
&ldquo;[Exclusivists] should provide independent evidence for the
claim that they have a special source of religious knowledge ... or
they should relinquish their exclusivist religious beliefs&rdquo;
(Silver 2001, 11).</p>

<p>
Others have suggested that in the face of unresolved epistemic peer
conflict, the (or a) rational course of action is to suspend judgment.
Richard Feldman has argued, for instance, that in those cases of
acknowledged epistemic peer conflict where we have no good reason for
believing that those disagreeing with us are &ldquo;making some kind
of mistake or failing to see some truth . . . the right thing for both
[sides] is to suspend judgment&rdquo; (Feldman 2007,
 212)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>.</p>
 
<p>
Those who promote a conciliatory response don&rsquo;t go this far.
Specifically, they don&rsquo;t maintain that exclusivists are required
to abandon or suspend judgment on their beliefs in the face of
unresolved epistemic peer disagreement. Proponents of what is often
labeled the &ldquo;Equal Weight View&rdquo; maintain that in the face
of unresolved epistemic peer conflict, both exclusivists and those
holding differing perspectives should adjust their confidence levels
to the point where those on both sides acknowledge that they and their
epistemic challengers have equally compelling evidence that they are
right (Elga 2007). Proponents of what is normally labeled
&ldquo;Strong Conciliationism&rdquo; do not require that exclusivists
grant equal credence to the positions of their epistemic peer critics
but do maintain that exclusivists are required to hold their beliefs
with significantly less confidence (Christensen 2007, 2020). Thomas
Kelly, an influential critic of this position, argues that &ldquo;when
faced with a peer who disagrees, knowing how one is rationally
required to respond will typically require an extremely substantive
judgment about one&rsquo;s overall epistemic situation, as opposed to
the straightforward application of a general norm that dictates
agnosticism in all such cases,&rdquo; as the strong conciliationist
holds (Kelly 2013, 52).</p>

<p>
Those who fall into the camp of what can be labeled &ldquo;Weak
Conciliationism&rdquo; do not argue that exclusivists need to hold
their beliefs with significantly less confidence in the face of
unresolved peer disagreement but do acknowledge that exclusivists
must, or at least be willing to, hold their exclusive religious
beliefs more tentatively&mdash;with somewhat less
confidence&mdash;(Quinn 2005a). This reduction in confidence
(tentativeness), Robert McKim tells us, has potential value in that it
can lead to deep tolerance: the allowance &ldquo;that those with whom
you disagree are people whom it is worthwhile to approach with
rational arguments&rdquo; (McKim 2001, 178) And personal tolerance of
this sort, we are told, may well lead to a more tolerant and open
society that will permit and even encourage a diversity of opinion on
all issues, including opinions on religious matters. [Whether this is
in fact the case is considered in detail in Section 5]</p>

<p>
William Alston is a leading representative of those who maintain that
the exclusivist is justified in remaining steadfast in the face of
peer conflict. His perspective is based on what he sees as a crucial
distinction between two types of epistemic disputes: those in which
&ldquo;it is clear what would constitute non-circular grounds for
supposing one of the contestants to be superior to the others&rdquo;
and those in which it is not. In the former case&mdash;in those cases
in which there is a commonly accepted &ldquo;procedure for settling
disputes&rdquo;&mdash;it is rational, he acknowledges, for individuals
to engage in serious belief assessment that could result in belief
modification or rejection (Alston 1988, 442&ndash;443).</p>

<p>
However, as Alston sees it, there exists no such common ground for
settling basic epistemic disputes over religious truth claims, and
this, he contends, alters the situation drastically. It still remains
true, he grants, that the reality of religious diversity diminishes
justification. But the fact that &ldquo;we are at a loss to specify
[common ground]&rdquo; means, he argues, that with respect to those
religious perspectives that are self-consistent, it is not
&ldquo;irrational for one to remain an exclusivist&rdquo;&mdash;not
irrational for proponents of any religious perspective to continue to
hold that their perspective is true. That is, as Alston sees it, given
the absence of common ground for resolving disputes, the proponent of
any self-consistent religious perspective can justifiably continue to
believe this perspective to be true &ldquo;despite not being able to
show that it is epistemically superior to the competition&rdquo;
(Alston 1988, 443&ndash;446). Stated differently yet, Alston grants
that objective evidence is necessary for justified belief when the
debated issue is one for which such evidence is available. However,
when objective evidence is not available&mdash;as is the case for most
important religious disputes&mdash;it cannot be required for justified
belief.</p>

<p>
In fact, at one point he goes even further. Because there exists at
present no neutral ground for adjudicating religious epistemic
conflicts, it is not only the case, Alston argues, that exclusivists
are justified (rational) in continuing to consider their own
perspective superior. Since we do not even know in most cases what a
non-circular reason for demonstrating superiority would look like, the
&ldquo;only rational course&rdquo; for exclusivists &ldquo;is to sit
tight&rdquo; with the beliefs &ldquo;which [have] served so well in
guiding [their] activity in the world.&rdquo; Or, to generalize this
point, Alston speaks for those who maintain that, given the absence of
common ground for adjudicating disputes concerning self-consistent
religious perspectives, it is not rational for exclusivists to stop
maintaining that their system is superior (Alston 1988, 444).</p>

<p>
Philip Quinn offers a noteworthy weak conciliatory response to
Alston&rsquo;s position. While he agrees with Alston that in the face
of diversity, exclusivists may well be justified in continuing to
&ldquo;sit tight&rdquo;&mdash;in continuing to maintain that their
religious perspective is true&mdash;he denies that this is the only
rational course of action available (Quinn 2000, 235&ndash;246). The
basis for this position is his distinction between a pre-Kantian and a
Kantian understanding of religious belief. To have a pre-Kantian
understanding of religious belief is to assume that we have (or at
least can have) access to the truth as it really is. It is to believe,
for instance, that we do (or at least can in principle) know what God
is really like. To have a Kantian understanding of religious belief is
to assume that although there is a literal noumenal reality, our
understanding of this reality (and thus our truth claims about this
reality) will of necessity be relative to the
cultural/social/psychological lenses through which our
conceptualization of this noumenal reality is processed. It is to
believe, for instance, that although there is a divine reality about
which we can make truth claims, our understanding of (and thus our
truth claims about) this divine reality will necessarily to some
extent be conditioned by the ways in which our environment (our
culture in the broadest sense) has shaped our categories of thought
(Quinn 2000, 241&ndash;242).</p>

<p>
Alston, Quinn contends, is essentially working off of a pre-Kantian
model of religious belief when he encourages religious exclusivists to
sit tight in the face of peer conflict since, in the absence of any
objective basis for determining which perspective is right, the
exclusivist has no sufficient reason not to do so. Quinn does not deny
that this pre-Kantian approach is justifiable and thus does not deny
that someone who follows Alston&rsquo;s advice to sit tight is
rational in doing so. However, Quinn believes that &ldquo;it should
not be taken for granted that any of the [contending perspectives] in
its present form is correct.&rdquo; Hence, he believes it is equally
justifiable for an exclusivist to adopt a Kantian approach to
religious belief. Specifically, he believes it is equally justifiable
for an exclusivist to assume that whatever any of us can know about
the truth of the matter will never be a description of religious
reality that is free of significant cultural/social/psychological
conditioning. Accordingly, it is also rational, he maintains, for
exclusivists encountering diverse truth claims to &ldquo;seek a more
inclusivist or pluralistic understanding of their own faith&rdquo; by
modifying their beliefs to bring them &ldquo;into line with such an
understanding&rdquo; (Quinn 2000, 242).</p>

<p>
In short, as Quinn sees it, those who hold a position such as
Alston&rsquo;s have left us, at least implicitly, with a false
dilemma: either we find common ground on which we can objectively
determine which religious perspective is the truth or we sit tight
with what we have. However, Quinn holds that once we realize it is
perfectly reasonable for a person to assume that the proponent of no
religious perspective has (or even could have) an accurate
understanding of divine reality as it really is, another rational
alternative appears. We then see that it is also perfectly rational
for people to begin to revise their own phenomenological perspective
on the truth in a way that will allow for greater overlap with the
phenomenological perspectives of those with whom they disagree.</p>

<p>
The approach to conflicting religious perspectives Quinn outlines has
in fact become increasingly prominent in some exclusivistic circles.
Consider, for example, the ongoing debate among conservative
Christians over how God brought the rest of reality into existence.
Some still claim the Bible clearly teaches that God created the
&ldquo;heavens and the earth&rdquo; in six twenty-four-hour periods
about ten thousand years ago. Others continue to maintain that the
fact that &ldquo;a day is to the Lord as a thousand years&rdquo;
(Psalms 90:4) means that while God is directly responsible for what
the Bible says was created each &ldquo;day,&rdquo; it is most
reasonable to believe that the time frame for each instance of
creative activity could well have been millions, or even billions, of
years. And then some still hold that God&rsquo;s direct creative
activity consisted primarily of orchestrating the &ldquo;Big
Bang.&rdquo; However, more recently, many conservative Christians have
taken a more Kantian approach. Based on their assumption that we may
well not have access, even through Scripture, to exactly how God was
involved in the creative process, they have modified what is to be
considered essential to Christianity on this issue. Rather than
affirming any of the specific explanations of how God created all
else, they affirm a more general contention compatible with each of
these specific explanations: that God is in some manner directly
responsible for the existence of all else. They have, in Quinn&rsquo;s
terms, thinned their core theologies in a way that reconciles the
divergent perspectives. [We will see below that this emphasis on
working toward common belief is sometimes cited as a way to minimize
differing perspectives on the eternal destiny of humans (Section 6)
and as a way to approach diversity of thought on controversial issues
in education (Section 7).]</p>

<p>
Most realize, though, that moving toward a thinner theology can only
resolve the epistemic tension produced by religious diversity to a
certain extent. Let&rsquo;s assume that it is perfectly reasonable,
and possibly even preferable, for exclusivists to thin their
theologies in an attempt to minimize that set of core beliefs that
must be affirmed to remain proponents of the specific theological
perspectives in question. To be an exclusivist&mdash;even a strongly
Kantian exclusivist&mdash;is still to believe that one&rsquo;s
religious perspectives on some religious beliefs are superior in the
sense that they are in some important way closer to the truth than are
the competing perspectives of others. Accordingly, while thinning
their theology may be a rational choice that can minimize conflict for
exclusivists to some extent, few deny that a certain amount of
epistemic conflict will remain.</p>

<p>
Finally, an increasing number of philosophers are at least
acknowledging a different, more pragmatic approach to addressing
conflicting perspectives on religious issues. This approach, often
labeled &ldquo;pragmatic encroachment,&rdquo; is based on the
distinction between (1) personal pragmatic
considerations&mdash;internal states such as psychological comfort,
professional interests, or moral commitments&mdash;and (2) objective
public evidence&mdash;evidence available to all persons involved in
the dispute (Fantl &amp; McGrath 2007). Proponents of this approach
maintain that while it is important to consider all objective evidence
when assessing beliefs in the face of peer conflict, it is also
rational (justifiable) to consider personal pragmatic factors when
making one&rsquo;s determinations.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers acknowledge this distinction but maintain that
epistemic rationality in the face of diversity of thought requires
adherence to objective considerations, apart from pragmatic factors
(Feldman 2007; Christensen 2020). Others, following in the spirit of
William James, are more sympathetic to allowing justifiable responses
to such diversity to be based in part on personal pragmatic
(practical) considerations to which only each participant has access.
Anastasia Scrutton maintains, for example, that when facing religious
epistemic conflicts, pragmatic &ldquo;considerations such as what is
at stake are epistemically significant [in that] they can raise or
lessen the extent to which your belief is justified or the amount of
knowledge you have&rdquo; (Scrutton 2016, 347). Mikael Stenmark
agrees, noting that in situations in which the evidence (that is, the
epistemic reasons) are approximately equal, pragmatic reasons can
justifiably play an important and at times decisive role (Stenmark
2024, 59).</p>

<p>
However, for exclusivists (or anyone) to justify the retention of
their beliefs even in part on pragmatic or other subjective factors
will seem to some just another way of saying that those with whom
exclusivists disagree are not fully their epistemic peers in the sense
that they don&rsquo;t share full access to all the relevant data.
While this is not, in and of itself, a non-question begging reason to
reject non-objective considerations, to grant that one need not
acknowledge that one&rsquo;s critic is an epistemic peer does
challenge the assumption of acknowledged peer conflict on which most
current philosophical discussions of disputes over religious beliefs
are based.</p>

<h2 id="ReliDiveReliTole">5. Religious Diversity and Religious Tolerance</h2>

<p>
Religious intolerance, defined as the practice of keeping others from
acting in accordance with their religious beliefs, is not new.
However, there is justifiable concern worldwide over the increasing
amount, and increasingly violent nature, of such behavior.
Accordingly, there is understandably a continuing interest in
fostering religiously tolerant environments in which individuals with
differing religious perspectives can practice their faiths
unencumbered at international, national, and local levels. However,
will acknowledged religious diversity lead to tolerance? Moreover,
even if it does, is tolerance sufficient to achieve positive,
productive interaction among adherents to different faith
perspectives? Or do we need some level of religious understanding to
achieve this end?</p>

<p>
For our purposes, to be tolerant of those with different religious
perspectives is to allow them to hold and practice their beliefs free
from interference or harassment. To have understanding is to learn
about and comprehend the practices and beliefs of those with differing
religious perspectives.</p>

<p>
We will focus first on the question of whether the acknowledgment of,
and subsequent reflection on, religious diversity might lead to
greater religious tolerance. While many philosophers continue to
emphasize the importance of religious tolerance in the face of
diversity, Philip Quinn&rsquo;s argument supporting the claim that
acknowledged diversity can foster tolerance is a good starting point
for considering whether it is reasonable to believe this might occur
(Quinn 2001, 2002, 2005a). Quinn maintains that (1) serious reflection
on the undeniable reality of religious diversity will necessarily
weaken people&rsquo;s justification for believing that their religious
perspective is superior to the perspectives of others and that (2)
this weakened justification can, and hopefully will for some, lead to
greater religious tolerance&mdash;will, for example, lead to a more
accepting, less confrontational attitude toward those with differing
religious perspectives.</p>

<p>
Both contentions have been challenged. Considering first Quinn&rsquo;s
claim that reflection on the acknowledged reality of religious
diversity reduces individuals&rsquo; justified confidence in the
superiority of their position, we have already seen in our discussion
of religious diversity and epistemic obligation (Section 3) that some
philosophers maintain that exclusivists need not grant that their
competitors are actually on an equal epistemic footing and are, thus,
justified in continuing to maintain that their perspective is superior
without further reflection. Moreover, we saw in our discussion of
religious diversity and justified belief (Section 4) that some
philosophers agree with Alston that exclusivists can grant that those
with whom they differ on religious beliefs are epistemic peers while
justifiably continuing to hold their beliefs with the same degree of
confidence.</p>

<p>
Quinn&rsquo;s second contention&mdash;that weakened justification in
the superiority of a perspective has the promising potential for
fostering religious tolerance&mdash;has also been challenged. For
instance, William Hasker questions whether Quinn&rsquo;s challenge to
those who hold firmly to the superiority of their religious
perspectives&mdash;that the reality of religious diversity requires
that they hold their perspectives less firmly&mdash;will have the
effect Quinn intended. It was Quinn&rsquo;s hope that those challenged
in this fashion would &ldquo;soften&rdquo; their exclusivistic
convictions and thus be less likely to engage in intolerant behavior.
However, might not just the opposite occur? Might not those told that
the reality of religious diversity reduces their justified confidence
in their beliefs feel threatened and thus, in an attempt to
&ldquo;stand up for the truths&rdquo; they still firmly believe,
become even more intolerant of those with other perspectives (Hasker
2008)? Others will agree with Bassam Al-Mannai that at least at the
national and international levels, &ldquo;the presence of diversity,
whether religious or ethnic, has little to do with tolerance.
It&rsquo;s rather the case that the racist ideologies followed by
absolute leaders cause friction to occur&rdquo; (Al-Mannai 2006,
87).</p>

<p>
Even if we assume that acknowledged religious diversity will lead to
religious tolerance&mdash;a more peaceful coexistence&mdash;is that
sufficient? Dirk-Martin Grube argues that whatever the value of
tolerance in the political realm, tolerance &ldquo;underdetermines a
robust interreligious dialogue&rdquo; since if I simply
&ldquo;tolerate the religious Other, I do not learn from her. Nor do I
consider her beliefs to be a reason to reflect on my own beliefs in a
self-critical fashion&rdquo; (Grube 2019, 187). It is only if we move
to a level of understanding that we will engage in the type of
interreligious dialog that will lead to fruitful, respectful
interaction.</p>

<p>
Several well-known commentators on the relationship between religious
tolerance and understanding, including Martha Nussbaum (Nussbaum
2012), Karen Armstrong (Armstrong 2010, 2014), and Tariq Modood
(Modood 2013), are even more specific. They agree that tolerance alone
is insufficient since it often lacks meaningful engagement among those
holding diverse perspectives on religious issues. It is moving to the
level of understanding that has the potential to reduce ignorance,
dispel stereotypes, and foster mutual respect, which in turn has the
potential to lead to cohesive communities where members respect and
support one
 another.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
However, as was noted in the discussion of epistemic obligation in
Section 3, it appears to be the case that when confronted with
criticisms of, or counter-evidence to, deeply engrained beliefs that
have emotional and/or cultural anchoring, one aspect of our default
epistemic response is to discredit the source&mdash;to challenge the
knowledge, motives, and/or character of those with whom we disagree.
To the extent this is true, moving from tolerating those with whom we
disagree to a form of understanding that includes respect for their
beliefs and practices will be more difficult than it might appear
would be the case.</p>

<h2 id="ReliDiveEterDestHuma">6. Religious Diversity and the Eternal Destiny of Humankind</h2>

<p>
Historically there is one specific &ldquo;diversity issue&rdquo; with
which many philosophers of religion have been concerned: the question
of the eternal destiny of humankind, that is, the question of who can
spend eternity in God&rsquo;s presence&mdash;who can obtain
 salvation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Those who are salvific religious exclusivists on this question claim
that only those who have met the necessary conditions set forth by one
religious perspective can spend eternity in God&rsquo;s
 presence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Adherents of other religious perspectives, it is acknowledged, can
affirm truth related to some or many issues. However, with respect to
the question of salvation (one&rsquo;s eternal destiny), a person must
come to understand and adhere to the unique way offered in one
religion. Or, to be more specific, as salvific exclusivists see it,
the criteria for salvation specified by the one correct religious
perspective are both epistemologically necessary in the sense that
those seeking salvation must be aware of these conditions for
salvation and ontologically necessary in the sense that these
conditions must really be met (Peterson et al. 2013, 322).</p>

<p>
Within Christianity, these conditions often include acknowledging
(confessing) that one&rsquo;s sinful nature has caused a separation
from God, acknowledging that this separation can only be repaired
through the atoning work of Christ, and then asking God to forgive
these sins and, based on this act, to be reinstated into a personal
relationship with God both now and through eternity. Within Islam,
these conditions often include absolute belief in the oneness of
Allah, acceptance of the Prophet Muhammad as the final messenger from
Allah, acceptance of the truth of and living in accordance with the
Quran, and adherence to the additional pillars of Islam. Since
salvific exclusivism, in general, requires a conscious understanding
of these necessary conditions and a conscious decision to either
accept or reject what is required for salvation, exclusivists face
questions about (1) the eternal destiny of children (or adults) who
die before (or without) having the capacity to accept or reject what
is necessary for salvation and (2) the eternal destiny of those who
through no fault of their own never became aware of what was necessary
for salvation and, therefore, were not able to accept or reject what
is required.</p>

<p>
There are at least two basic types of salvific exclusivists.
Predestinarian exclusivists hold that for those who are aware of the
necessary conditions for salvation, God has for God&rsquo;s reasons
predetermined who will be saved and who will not&mdash;that is, has
predetermined how they will freely (with compatiblistic freedom)
respond to what they know is necessary for salvation. The majority of
Christian predestinarians hold that those who will never become aware
of the necessary conditions for salvation have not been predestined to
be saved and thus will spend eternity apart from God (Piper 2010;
Henry 1991). Some Muslim predestinarians agree (Aijaz 2024,
12&ndash;13).</p>

<p>
Predestinarian salvific exclusivists differ on the eternal destiny of
those who die in childhood. Those Christians in the Augustinian
tradition maintain that all will spend eternity apart from God; those
in the Roman Catholic tradition tie salvation for children who die to
the sacrament of baptism; and those in the Reformed tradition maintain
either that only the deceased children of believers are allowed to
enter heaven or that some or all of these children may be predestined
to spend eternity with God. Muslim predestinarian salvific
exclusivists also differ on this question.</p>

<p>
Universal access exclusivists hold that all will have the opportunity
to understand what is necessary to attain salvation and freely make
(with indeterministic freedom) the decision to confess their sins and
ask God to reinstate them into a personal relationship with God now
and for eternity. Most universal access exclusivists (both Christian
and Muslim) maintain that God&rsquo;s justice and mercy require that
children (or adults) who die before (or without) having the
opportunity to hear and respond to what is necessary for salvation
will spend eternity in God&rsquo;s presence. Proponents of this view
differ on the question of the eternal destiny of those who, through no
fault of their own, die without having become aware of what is
necessary for salvation. Some Christian universal exclusivists
maintain, for example, that while many humans do not have access to
knowledge of Christ, all humans do have access to the existence of God
as a divine being through experiencing God&rsquo;s creation and will
be judged on the basis of how they respond to this knowledge. This is
also a common belief in mainstream Sunni Muslim thought (Aijaz 2024,
11). Other Christian universal exclusivists ground their response on
the concept of divine middle knowledge&mdash;the belief in this case
that God knows counterfactually for each individual how that
individual would freely respond if presented with the gospel. William
Craig maintains, for instance, that since God is just, &ldquo;God in
His providence has so arranged the world that anyone who would receive
Christ has the opportunity to do so&rdquo; (Craig 1989, 185). Another
middle knowledge option is to argue that God counterfactually knows
for every person who will never actually hear the necessary conditions
for salvation how that person would have responded if this individual
had become aware of these conditions and judges the person accordingly
(Lake 1975, 43). Still other Christian universal exclusivists maintain
that all who die without becoming aware of these conditions will have
the opportunity in some manner to understand and respond to these
conditions after death (Walls 2015). Finally, some Christian and
Muslim universal exclusivists admit they do not know exactly how God
will judge those who were never aware of the requirements for
salvation but believe that a just and merciful God will treat all in
this category fairly (Stott &amp; Edwards 1988; Rahman 1980).</p>

<p>
Salvific inclusivists agree with salvific exclusivists that the actual
basis on which a person can be reconciled and spend eternity with God
is only found in one religion. For example, Christian inclusivists
agree that humans can only be reconciled with God because of the
atoning act of Christ. Muslim exclusivists emphasize that Allah is the
ultimate arbiter of salvation, and no one has eternal life except
through His will and mercy.</p>

<p>
However, salvific inclusivists do not maintain &ldquo;that only the
believers or practitioners of [the one true religion] during their
earthly lives, will be redeemed&rdquo; (Benton 2020). Salvific
inclusivists allow that some adherents of other religions can be saved
because of the provisions of the one true religion, even if the
individuals in question haven&rsquo;t made the personal commitments
normally stipulated as necessary to appropriate these salvific
provisions. Stated in philosophical language, as inclusivists see it,
particular salvific events may be ontologically necessary for
salvation in the sense that salvation cannot occur without them but
not epistemically necessary in the sense that one need not know about
or act upon them to be saved or liberated (Moser 2011; Peterson et al.
2013, 334).</p>

<p>
For example, Christian inclusivists maintain that Christians need not
be aware of the atoning act of Christ, confess one&rsquo;s sins, and
ask for forgiveness to become reconciled to Christ and spend eternity
in God&rsquo;s presence. Muslim inclusivists don&rsquo;t insist that a
person must believe in the oneness of Allah, accept the Prophet
Muhammad as the final messenger from Allah, accept the truth of and
live in accordance with the Quran, and adhere to the additional
pillars of Islam to spend eternity in Paradise.</p>

<p>
With respect to the question of whether religions other than the one
true religion can offer pathways to salvation, those sometimes labeled
restrictive salvific inclusivists hold that while an individual need
not be aware of the one true pathway for reconciliation to utilize
this pathway to access reconciliation, no other religion offers a
sufficient pathway to access this salvific reconciliation (Pinnock
1992). Most salvific inclusivists, however, are non-restrictive
(sometimes referred to as pluralistic) inclusivists on this question
in that they hold that while salvation (reconciliation with God) is
only possible because of the pathway for reconciliation found in one
religion, other religions may serve as imperfect but sufficient
pathways to access salvific reconciliation with God (D&rsquo;Costa
2022). For instance, a non-restrictive salvific inclusivistic Muslim
would hold that following the Christian path to salvation may serve as
an imperfect but sufficient pathway to eternal reconciliation with God
and vice versa. In the words of Muslim inclusivist V.A. Mohamad
Ashrof, there are deep roots in the Islamic tradition that
&ldquo;distinguish &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; (capital
&lsquo;I&rsquo;)&mdash;the historical, institutionalized faith
revealed to Muhammad&mdash;and &lsquo;islam&rsquo; (small
&lsquo;i&rsquo;)&mdash;the universal, primordial faith of submission
to God&rsquo;s will that transcends specific religious
traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;this distinction allows inclusivists to
assert that non-Muslims, through their respective beliefs, may also
submit to God&rsquo;s will and, thus, attain salvation&rdquo; (Ashrof
2024).</p>

<p>
Probably the best-known Christian proponent of non-restrictive
inclusivism is Karl Rahner. Christianity, he argues, cannot recognize
any other religion as providing the source of salvation, and
Christianity is the normative and most complete path to salvation.
However, other religions can serve as imperfect means through which
individuals can encounter God&rsquo;s grace and respond to the divine
will. Just as adherents to pre-Christian Judaism were able, through
the redemptive acts of Jesus of which they were not aware, to enter
God&rsquo;s presence, so, too, is it possible for adherents of other
religions to enter God&rsquo;s presence, even though they do not
acknowledge the necessary redemptive acts of Jesus Christ that makes
this possible (Peterson et al. 2013, 334&ndash;335). Since God is love
and desires everyone to be saved, God can apply the results of
Jesus&rsquo;s atoning death and resurrection to everyone, even to
those who have never heard of Jesus and his death or have never
acknowledged his lordship. Rahner used the term &ldquo;anonymous
Christian&rdquo; for non-Christians who unknowingly appropriate the
salvific work of Christ.</p>

<p>
All salvific inclusivists, like some exclusivists, maintain that
children and those adults without the capacity to understand the true
path to salvation will when they die be in God&rsquo;s presence
eternally due to God&rsquo;s justice and mercy. With respect to those
who have the capacity to follow the true path but die without
knowledge of this true path, inclusivists differ on the conditions
&ldquo;anonymous Christians&rdquo; must meet to receive salvific
grace. Some, like Rahner, maintain all have some innate knowledge of
God and the freedom to establish a relationship with God and,
therefore, that the eternal destiny of those in this category is
dependent on the extent to which they sincerely seek truth and respond
to their inner moral conscience&mdash;on the extent to which they
commit as much as they know of themselves to as much as they know of
God through, or even apart from, a religion other than Christianity.
Other inclusivists are not as specific, maintaining only that, because
God is just, there will surely be some adherents of other religions or
no religion at all who will be in God&rsquo;s presence because they
have met some set of divine conditions they have it within their power
to meet. All agree, though that these &ldquo;anonymous
Christians&rdquo; are the recipients of divine grace.</p>

<p>
But what of those who have become aware of what is required for
reconciliation with God in the true path to salvation but have not
done what is necessary for such reconciliation &mdash;for example,
what of those who become aware of the opportunity for reconciliation
with God through Christ&rsquo;s atoning act or the conditions for
salvation in Islam but choose not to do what is required for such
reconciliation. While all exclusivists clearly hold that these
individuals will not receive salvific reconciliation, the
inclusivistic response to those who are aware of the true path to
salvation but do not choose to follow it is more complicated. Some
make a distinction between willful and circumstantial rejection. They
maintain that while willful, informed rejections of this true path
might well prohibit salvific reconciliation with God (Erickson, 1983),
the fact that someone has chosen not to follow the path to salvific
reconciliation of which this person is seemingly aware doesn&rsquo;t
mean that this person truly understands what this path is, based on
cultural, historical, or psychological barriers, and thus
doesn&rsquo;t mean that this person will not spend eternity with God.
That is a judgment only a just but merciful God can make.</p>

<p>
Morteza Mutahhari is a proponent of Muslim salvific inclusivism who
makes this distinction. He maintains that non-Muslims are at a
disadvantage because it is the Islamic Divine Law that leads people to
God. Those who fully understand this law (Islam) but choose not to
accept the truth will be damned. However, in accordance with Islamic
jurisprudence, God will be merciful to those who seek the truth but
from whom, through no fault of their own, the reality of Islam remains
hidden. Such people cannot be called unbelievers; they are rather
&ldquo;dispositional Muslims&rdquo; since it is possible to possess
the requisite spirit of submission without being Muslim in name. These
individuals will receive the divine grace necessary to achieve
salvation from Hell (Mutahhari 2006; see also Legenhausen 1997
[1999]).</p>

<p>
Salvific pluralists, however, find such reasoning no more convincing
than that offered by salvific exclusivists. Inclusivists are right,
pluralists grant, to say that individuals need not necessarily know of
or fulfill certain requirements specified in a given religion to
attain salvation. However, salvific inclusivists, like salvific
exclusivists, are wrong to argue that salvation is, itself, possible
only because of certain conditions or events described in the one true
religion. There is no one true religion and, therefore, no single path
to eternal existence with God. Stated differently, there are multiple
valid paths to salvation, with no single religious tradition holding
exclusive or privileged access to it; people from different faiths can
achieve salvation fully within their own traditions.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s important to note that to be a salvific pluralist does not
prohibit an individual from identifying with or worshipping within a
given religious tradition &ndash; for example, Christianity or Islam.
Nor does it prohibit an individual from identifying strands of thought
within a given religious tradition that support pluralism &ndash; see
Yaser Ellethy (2022) for a good example of this within Islam. To be a
salvific pluralist requires only that one believes that no one
religious tradition has privileged access to salvation but rather that
the paths to salvation within various religious traditions, including
those traditions that one might not happen to identify with, are of
equal salvific efficacy.</p>

<p>
The best-known and most influential variation of salvific pluralism is
unitary pluralism, which holds that all religions &ldquo;are, or can
be, equal and valid paths to the one divine reality&rdquo;
(D&rsquo;Costa 2022, Section 3), a divine reality that is
characterized in different ways in various religions. A more recent
but significant form of salvific pluralism is pluriform pluralism,
which holds that there is no single divine reality underlying all
religious traditions but, rather, multiple, distinct paths to
different divine realities in various religions. Stated differently,
pluriform salvific pluralism holds that different religions may be
accessing different divine realities or &ldquo;gods&rdquo; through
their practices, implying a plurality of divine realities rather than
a single one (D&rsquo;Costa 2022).</p>

<p>
John Hick is the most influential proponent of unitary salvific
pluralism. Hick has never denied that the major world
religions&mdash;Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam&mdash;make
conflicting truth claims. In fact, he believes that &ldquo;the
differences of belief between (and within) the traditions are
legion&rdquo; and has often discussed these conflicts in great detail
(Hick 1983, 487). His basic pluralistic claim, rather, is that such
differences are best seen as differing ways in which differing
cultures have conceived of and experienced the one ultimate divine
Reality. Each major religious perspective &ldquo;constitutes a valid
context of salvation/liberation; but none constitutes the one and only
such context&rdquo; (Hick 1984, 229, 231).</p>

<p>
Hick&rsquo;s main argument for his position is what he sees as the
reality of transformation parity. An efficacious salvific process
changes lives in the sense that it begins to turn people from thinking
about, and acting only to enhance, their own personal well-being to
viewing themselves as responsible participants in a much greater, more
expansive reality. And all the evidence we have, Hick maintains, shows
that many religions are equally transformational, given any general
standard for positive transformation we might want to consider (Hick
2004, chapter 3).</p>

<p>
There continues to be debate, however, over whether there is an
objective basis for claiming that the same basic personal
transformation actually does occur within various religions&mdash;over
whether there is real transformational parity. Also, it appears that
individuals making a &ldquo;secular&rdquo; (non-religious) commitment
to some goal, value, or metaphysical perspective&mdash;be it a concern
for the environment, world hunger, or emotional health&mdash;often
have their lives transformed in ways quite similar to the ways in
which the lives of religious believers are transformed. If this is so,
however, then might it not be that the religious transformational
parity we observe is simply a subset of the general transformational
parity we find among individuals who commit themselves to any
perspective on life that centers reality outside of self, and thus
that it is just as plausible to assume that all religious
transformational parity is the result of some form of internal
conceptual realignment rather than the result of some form of
connection with an external divine reality (Clark 1997)?</p>

<p>
Hick also argues that a credible religious hypothesis must account for
the fact, of which &ldquo;we have become irreversibly aware in the
present century, as the result of anthropological, sociological, and
psychological studies and the work of philosophy of language,&rdquo;
that there is no one universal and invariable pattern for the
interpretation of human experience, but rather a range of
significantly different patterns or conceptual schemes &ldquo;which
have developed within the major cultural streams.&rdquo; When
considered in this light, a &ldquo;pluralistic theory becomes
inevitable&rdquo; (Hick 1984, 232).</p>

<p>
While no one denies that culture shapes reality to some extent, it can
again be argued, as noted in Sections 3 and 4, that when comparing the
plausibility of specific beliefs, we must consider not only these
specific beliefs themselves but also the basic background beliefs in
which they are embedded. Thus, even if we grant that a pluralistic
response to the obvious shaping power of culture is preferable to any
exclusivistic response when such shaping power is considered in
isolation, it is not clear that exclusivists must acknowledge that
Hick&rsquo;s hypothesis is so strong that it renders implausible the
whole set of basic background beliefs out of which the
exclusivist&rsquo;s response to the profound shaping influence of
culture on religious belief arises. It appears, rather, that
exclusivists can justifiably reject Hick&rsquo;s contention that a
pluralistic cultural/religious interpretation of reality must
inevitably be considered superior.</p>

<p>
Others have questioned why Hick has selected only the paths offered by
the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;great religions&rdquo; as ways to salvation?
For Hick, the answer lies in the fact that, unlike &ldquo;Satanism,
Nazism, the Order of the Solar Temple, etc.,&rdquo; the world&rsquo;s
great religions offer paths that lead us away from &ldquo;hatred,
misery, aggression, unkindness, impatience, violence, and lack of
self-control&rdquo; to love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Hick 1997b, 164). Some,
though, see this sort of ethical standard for acceptable salvific
perspectives to be as arbitrary as the standard for acceptable paths
to salvation set forth by exclusivists or inclusivists (Meeker 2003).
In fact, some have questioned whether, given this rather specific
ethical criterion for assessing the salvific adequacy of religions,
Hick&rsquo;s perspective should actually be considered pluralistic at
all.</p>

<p>
Pluriform salvific pluralist Mark Heim also argues that unitary
pluralists such as Hick are really inclusivists in disguise in that
they advocate only one path to salvation&mdash; for example, the
transformation from self-centeredness to
reality-centeredness&mdash;and thus, in essence, deny that diverse
religions have real, fundamental salvific differences. A better, more
honest salvific pluralism, we are told, is to acknowledge that each
religion has its own path to salvation that may be either similar to
or different from that of other religions. That is, a more honest
pluralistic perspective is to deny that the seemingly different
salvific paths offered by various religious traditions are all just
culturally distinct manifestations of the same fundamental path and
maintain instead that salvific paths of various religions remain
incompatible, but equally valid ways to achieve salvation (Heim
1995).</p>

<p>
Other pluriform pluralists include theologian Raimon Panikkar, whose
concept of &ldquo;cosmotheandric reality&rdquo; (the
interconnectedness of the divine, human, and cosmic dimensions of
reality) supports differing understandings of how to access and
understand the divine in various religious traditions without assuming
that all these paths to the divine ultimately lead to one divine
reality (Panikkar 1973, 1987).</p>

<p>
Some might argue, though, that while this variation of pluralism does
seem to do justice to the concern raised in Section 1 that philosophy
of religion ought to focus more on the distinctions found in various
religions rather than trying to highlight only that which they have in
common, pluriform pluralism&rsquo;s focus on the equal validity of
paths to the divine that affirm seemingly inconsistent understandings
of divine reality&mdash;e.g., incompatible claims about the nature of
self in an afterlife&mdash;make it difficult to address questions
about the ultimate nature of reality in a non-relativistic manner.</p>

<p>
Others wonder whether this seeming disagreement between unitary and
pluriform pluralists is in one key sense primarily a difference in
focus. Pluriform pluralists like Heim can appear to be bypassing the
question of whether there is some sort of final, ultimate
eschatological salvific state that the proponents of various religious
perspectives will all experience, emphasizing rather that many
distinct religious paths can liberate people (produce salvation) here
and now (Peterson et al. 2013, 333). Unitary pluralists like Hick, on
the other hand, seem most concerned with the nature of the final
eschatological state all will experience while not denying that there
exist in this world differing ways that remain distinct to access this
ultimate salvific experience.</p>

<h2 id="ReliDivePublEduc">7. Religious Diversity in Public Education</h2>

<p>
Public education in Western culture has always been to some extent a
&ldquo;melting
 pot.&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 However, the increasing number of students with non-Western cultural
values and religious traditions is causing public school educators to
grapple in new and sometimes uncomfortable ways with the challenges
such diversity poses. Some of these challenges are
practical&mdash;e.g., should Muslim girls be allowed to wear hijabs,
should schools designate only Christian religious holy days as school
holidays, and how should educators respond to political efforts to
favor one religion? The focus of this section, however, will be a
pedagogical question of growing interest in the philosophy of
education: How ought the increasing religious diversity to which
students are exposed affect public school curricula?</p>

<p>
Assuming the separation of church and state, it can initially appear
non-problematic to stipulate guidelines for addressing religion in the
public school classroom. Educators should encourage &ldquo;student
<em>awareness</em> of religions, but <em>not acceptance</em> of a
particular religion; <em>studying</em> about religion, but <em>not
practicing</em> religion; <em>exposing</em> students to a diversity of
religious views, but <em>not imposing</em> any particular view; and
<em>educating</em> students about all religions, but <em>not promoting
or denigrating</em> religion&rdquo; (Moore 2010, 1). However, as we
will see, educators sometimes differ on the application of these
distinctions to specific pedagogical questions.</p>

<p>
Most public school educators do agree that increasing student
understanding of diverse religious perspectives can have significant
positive social outcomes. It is often argued, for instance, that
helping students better understand the increasing diversity, including
religious diversity, they face will better prepare them to live in a
peaceful, productive, less prejudicial environment with those with
differing cultural and/or religious values (Kunzman 2006; Rosenblith,
2017). In fact, some have gone so far as to say such understanding
&ldquo;is necessary for effective and engaged citizenship in an
interconnected and diverse nation and world&rdquo; (College, Career,
and Civic Life 2013, 92).</p>

<p>
Many educators, however, want to go further. It is also important,
they maintain, for students to clarify their feelings about other
religions and their followers. Specifically, they want to foster a
more empathetic understanding of other religious perspectives, an
understanding that encourages students to appreciate other religions
from the perspective of an adherent of that religion (Kunzman
2006;Tinklenberg, 2020).</p>

<p>
While few challenge this as a valid goal, there is, though, continuing
controversy over one common method by which educators sometimes
attempt to engender this type of empathy in students. As some see it,
an impactful way to help develop an empathetic understanding of other
religions is to have students directly experience these religions in
some way&mdash;for instance, have students visit a local mosque or
have a representative from a Hindu Temple share with students in a
class.</p>

<p>
Not surprisingly, while no one denies that these forms of direct
experience might broaden a student&rsquo;s empathetic understanding of
a religion, concerns have been raised. First, some believe that having
students experience a religion, even as &ldquo;observers,&rdquo; can
test the limits of the separation of church and state. While the
intent of having students attend a mosque or having a Buddhist talk
with students is seldom to &ldquo;promote&rdquo; a religion, the line
between &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; and intended or unintended promotion
(or even proselytization), they maintain, is a fine one. This is
especially the case given the widely varying communication skills and
deeply embedded values and preconceptions of the teacher and/or the
representatives of a given religion with whom students might interact.
Second, there is a continuing ethical concern that to experience a
religion as an observer might in some cases trivialize or demean the
religion in question. Some Native Americans, for instance, continue to
be concerned with the desire of &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; to seek an
understanding of their religion(s) by watching or experiencing sacred
ceremonies since such observation, they believe, can trivialize these
ceremonies (Kasprisin 2003, 422; Taliman 1993).</p>

<p>
Is it justifiable for the public school educator to go even further
than disseminating accurate information and attempting to engender an
empathetic understanding of other religions? Is it justifiable to
attempt to bring it about that all students affirm a core set of
&ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; beliefs about other religions and their
adherents?</p>

<p>
It is clearly the case that almost all public school educators
currently do attempt to bring it about that students hold certain
beliefs related to pervasive human characteristics, such as race,
gender, and disabling conditions. Students are encouraged, for
instance, to continue to believe, or come to believe, that engaging in
intolerant or discriminatory behavior is wrong and that they should
affirm, or come to affirm, the inherent worth and rights of the
disabled, those of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, etc. Therefore, if
the desire is simply to also encourage students to believe it wrong to
treat those of other religions in intolerant or discriminatory ways
and to believe it right to accept those of other religions as persons
with equal inherent value, few will object.</p>

<p>
However, need teachers stop there? Might there not be other beliefs
about religions and their adherents that public school educators can
justifiably attempt to bring about that all students accept? We can
extrapolate from the work on religious diversity by Robert Wuthnow to
introduce two beliefs that some might propose fit into this category.
As Wuthnow sees it, the most appropriate response to the increasing
religious diversity we face in the United States is what he labels
&ldquo;reflective pluralism&rdquo; (Wuthnow 2005, 286&ndash;307). To
engage in this sort of reflection, he tells us, is not simply to
become better informed, or to strive to &ldquo;live peacefully with
those with whom one disagrees&rdquo; (be tolerant), or even to attempt
to develop an empathetic understanding of diverse religions. It is at
the very least (1) to recognize that since all of our beliefs,
including our religious beliefs, depend on a point of view
&ldquo;shaped by the culture in which we live,&rdquo; we should not
regard our &ldquo;own position[s] as inherently superior&rdquo; and
(2) to promote &ldquo;a principled willingness to compromise&rdquo; in
the sense that we must be willing to move out of our social and
emotional comfort levels &ldquo;in order to arrive at a workable
relationship with another person&rdquo; (Wuthnow 2005, 292).</p>

<p>
The benefit of this form of engagement, we are told, is not only that
it can minimize the likelihood of the sorts of &ldquo;religious
tensions, conflicts, and violence [that] have been so much a part of
human history&rdquo; (Wuthnow 2005, 293). Such reflective engagement
also allows us to focus on &ldquo;the shared concerns for basic human
dignity&rdquo; found in the teachings of many of the world&rsquo;s
religions, which can furnish a basis for inter-religious cooperation
to combat social ills and meet basic social needs (Wuthnow 2005,
294).</p>

<p>
It is important to note that Wuthnow does not explicitly claim or deny
that encouraging students in a public school setting to become
reflective pluralists would be appropriate. However, he not only
highlights two increasingly popular pluralistic claims about
religion&mdash;(1) that the beliefs of many religions are equally
valid expressions of faith, expressions that adherents of these
religions should be allowed or even encouraged to maintain and (2)
that religious believers of all faiths should identify and focus on
what these religions have in common&mdash;he highlights what such
pluralists often note as the main benefits of widespread affirmation
of these beliefs: a reduction in violent religious conflicts and an
increase in socially beneficial inter-religious cooperation. These
outcomes are clearly quite compatible with what we have seen to be a
key reason why public-school educators want to increase student
understanding of other religions&mdash;namely, their desire to better
prepare students to live in a peaceful, productive manner in social
contexts that will increasingly be characterized by religious
diversity. Accordingly, since it seems reasonable to believe that
widespread acceptance of the validity of diverse religious
perspectives and increased focus on the commonalities in diverse
religions might well result in more peaceful, mutually beneficial
interaction among followers of diverse religions, the question of
whether public school teachers can justifiably attempt to bring it
about that students affirm the beliefs in question appears worthy of
exploration.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s first consider the contention that many religions contain
equally valid expressions of faith. Even if we accept the debatable
assumption that this is true, it will understandably not be clear to
many that public school teachers could justifiably attempt to bring it
about that their students believed this to be so. The problem is that
various religions affirm conflicting doctrinal beliefs on significant
issues. For example, while conservative Christians maintain that one
must affirm certain beliefs about the saving power of Christ to spend
eternity in God&rsquo;s presence, conservative Muslims strongly deny
this. Orthodox Christians and Muslims are taught not only that the
sacred scriptures of other religions contain false beliefs; they are
often encouraged to try to convert those of other religions to their
religious perspective. And while many Muslims, Christians, and Jews
believe in a personal supernatural creator and personal immortality,
some Buddhists deny both. In short, the problem here, as stated by
Stephen Prothero, is that &ldquo;one of the most common misconceptions
about the world&rsquo;s religions is that they plumb the same depths,
ask the same questions. They do not&rdquo; (Prothero 2010, 24). If
this is so, it appears that educators can justifiably attempt to
convince students that all religions are equally valid expressions of
faith only if educators can justifiably attempt to convince
conservative proponents of some of these religions that some of their
core doctrinal beliefs need to be modified or rejected. However,
attempting to do this in a public school setting will be seen by many
as violating the prohibition against both restricting the free
exercise of religion and promoting a given religion (Basinger
2011).</p>

<p>
Might it not, though, at least be justifiable for a public school
educator to encourage students to respect the right of adherents to
other religions to retain their current religious beliefs? If we
interpret this as asking whether an educator can justifiably encourage
students to not attempt to prohibit adherents to other religions from
expressing and acting in accordance with their beliefs, a positive
response is noncontroversial since this is only to say once again that
educators should encourage students to be tolerant of others. However,
to encourage respect for the religious beliefs of others often carries
with it the explicit or implicit assumption that it is inappropriate,
if not unethical, to attempt to convince adherents of one religion to
convert to another. For a public-school educator to attempt to
convince all students that it is wrong to proselytize will again be
seen by some as placing this educator in the legally and morally
questionable position of attempting to convince some students to
reject or modify what for them is a very fundamental, core religious
belief.</p>

<p>
Perhaps, however, there is a different, less controversial option for
those educators who want to do more than simply encourage tolerance of
expression and empathetic understanding. Is it not at least
justifiable for the public school teacher to attempt to point out the
important common values affirmed by most of the world&rsquo;s major
religions, values that we can all accept and should all desire to see
lived out? Is it not justifiable for an educator to point out, for
instance, that most of the world&rsquo;s major religions prohibit such
things as killing, lying, stealing, dehumanizing racism, and sexual
exploitation, and that these same religions encourage such things as
helping those in need and treating adherents of other religions with
respect? To do so, it has been argued, would not simply be of value
within the classroom or community. Since religious convictions clearly
influence social, political, and economic activity on a global scale,
emphasizing the shared common values of religions has the potential to
facilitate better global relationships. And to encourage such
relationships is surely an appropriate goal of public education
(Haynes 2007; Shingleton 2008).</p>

<p>
Some concerns have been raised even here. First, the values of various
religions are embedded in various cultures, and there are often
differing cultural understandings of these values &ndash; for example,
differing understandings of what it means for humans to have personal
social or political freedom, what it means to care for those in need,
etc. In other words, we must be aware that in some cases seeming
commonality in values may be in name only (Prothero 2010). Second,
some argue that this approach can lead to a superficial, homogenized
understanding of religions that can prevent students from respecting
the distinctiveness of each religious tradition and thus failing to
fully appreciate the unique contributions each has made (Skrefsrud
2023; Ilosvay 2016). Finally, some will see any focus on
&ldquo;positive commonalities&rdquo; as yet another thinly veiled
inappropriate attempt to encourage students to modify or water down
their current religious beliefs in ways that make such beliefs more
accommodating of other religious perspectives. Still others, though,
will not see these concerns as reasons not to expose students to the
&ldquo;positive commonalities&rdquo; in various religions but, rather,
as cautionary factors to keep in mind when doing so.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">8. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As we have seen, discussions of religious diversity do not lend
themselves to easy answers. The issues are many, the arguments
complex, and the responses varied. It would be hard, though, to
overstate the practical significance of this topic. While some (many)
issues that philosophers discuss have practical implications for how
we view ourselves and treat others, none is more relevant today than
the question of religious diversity. Religious convictions have not
only motivated impassioned behavior in the past&mdash;behavior that
has affected significantly the lives of many&mdash;such convictions
clearly continue to do so today. So ongoing philosophical discussions
of religious diversity that clarify issues and assess varying
perspectives have the potential to be of great practical value.</p>
