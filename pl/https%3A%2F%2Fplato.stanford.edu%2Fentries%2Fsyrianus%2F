<h1>Syrianus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jul 6, 2009; substantive revision Tue Oct 21, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Syrianus of Alexandria was a Neoplatonist philosopher active mainly in
Athens between the late 4<sup>th</sup> and early 5<sup>th</sup>
century, C.E. He was the second head of the Neoplatonic Academy of
Athens, one of the two chief philosophical schools in the
Mediterranean landscape of the 5<sup>th</sup>&ndash;6<sup>th</sup>
century, C.E., along with that of Alexandria. Among several other
works now for the most part unfortunately lost, Syrianus authored a
commentary on books <em>Beta</em> (III), <em>Gamma</em> (IV),
<em>Mu</em> (XIII) and <em>Nu</em> (XIV) of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Metaphysics</em>, one of the very few extant ancient commentaries
on this work<em>.</em> An influential teacher of philosophy and
rhetoric, Syrianus established on several philosophical issues the
standard view of late ancient Athenian Platonism. His teachings were
built upon, expanded and systematized by Proclus (412&ndash;485), his
most distinguished pupil and successor as leader of the Academy.
Especially through Proclus, they exerted a major influence on later
philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="LifWor">1. Life and works</h2>

<h3 id="Lif">1.1 Life</h3>

<h4>1.1.1 Main Biographical Data</h4>

<p>
Our limited knowledge of Syrianus&rsquo; life stems from three main
ancient sources: Marinus of Neapolis&rsquo; <em>Proclus or on
Happiness</em>, a commemorative speech of Proclus, mostly known under
the inauthentic title of <em>Life of Proclus</em> (cf. Saffrey-Segonds
2001), written by his successor scholarch; Damascius&rsquo; <em>Life
of Isidore</em>, both a biography of Damascius&rsquo; master and a
sort of general history of 5<sup>th</sup> century Neoplatonist
philosophers, also known as <em>The Philosophical History</em> (cf.
Athanassiadi 1999); and the article <em>Syrianos</em> in the ancient
lexicon <em>Souda</em> (&Sigma; 1662, IV 478.21&ndash;479.8
Adler).</p>

<p>
The son of an otherwise unknown Philoxenus (cf. Martindale 1980: 878,
1325), Syrianus was born in Alexandria (cf. Damascius, <em>Life of
Isidore</em>, fr. 34D, 112.8 Athanassiadi [A.] = <em>Souda</em>
&Sigma; 1662, IV 479.6 Adler), most likely in the second half of the
4<sup>th</sup> century, C.E. This was a tumultuous era for his native
city and the wider Roman Empire. Alexandria, long celebrated as a
major cultural and commercial hub (cf. e.g. Diodorus Siculus,
XVII.52.5; tr. Oldfather: &ldquo;the first city of the civilized
world&rdquo;; Ammianus Marcellinus XXII.16.7; tr. Rolfe: &ldquo;the
crown of all cities&rdquo;), became increasingly burdened by strife
between its pagan elite and a notoriously quarrelsome Christian
populace. This resulted, among other things, in the murder at
Christian hands of the philosopher and mathematician Hypatia (c.
355&ndash;415). More broadly, the Empire was undergoing profound
political and religious shifts: the Gothic victory at Adrianople (378)
shook its foundations, and Christianity became the state religion
under Theodosius I, who reigned from 379 to 395, leading to
intensified suppression of both Christian heresies and pagan
practices.</p>

<p>
In this context Syrianus probably received a basic education in
rhetoric and philosophy in Alexandria. Then he moved to Athens (we do
not know exactly when) to pursue philosophical studies under Plutarch
of Athens (c. 350&ndash;432), a highly respected Platonist
philosopher, commentator, and teacher, also known as &ldquo;the
Great&rdquo; (cf. e.g. Marinus, <em>Proclus</em>, &sect;12.2, p. 14
Saffrey-Segonds [S.-S.]; the epithet is also attested for Syrianus
himself, cf. Luna 2016: 679). Unfortunately, all his works are lost,
apart from a few fragments (cf. Taormina 1989, Longo 2010, and
Luna-Segonds 2012). Plutarch was responsible for re-establishing the
Platonic Academy in Athens, with major consequences for late
Neoplatonism. The Academy became, along with the school of Alexandria,
the chief philosophical school in the Mediterranean landscape of the
5<sup>th</sup>&ndash;6<sup>th</sup> century, C.E., until its abrupt
closure by Justinian&rsquo;s edict of 529 C.E., which prohibited
teaching &ldquo;to those who are sick with the sacrilegious madness of
the Hellenes&rdquo; (<em>Codex Iustinianus</em> I 11.10 &sect;2
Kr&uuml;ger; cf. Cameron 1969; Wildberg 2005). It had no institutional
continuity with Plato&rsquo;s original Academy, which ceased to
function long before, in the 1<sup>st</sup> century B.C.E., at the
time of the first Mithridatic War and Sulla&rsquo;s siege of Athens of
86 B.C.E. Rather, it was a kind of private foundation based in
Plutarch&rsquo;s own house&nbsp;and professing doctrinal and spiritual
continuity with Plato&rsquo;s own school. Located at the south slope
of the Acropolis, close to the temples of Asclepius and Dionysus (so
not at the site now known as the original location of Plato&rsquo;s
Academy outside the ancient city&rsquo;s walls), it served as both a
teaching quarter and accommodation for masters and students (cf.
Caruso 2013). Syrianus first lived and studied there as a close
associate of Plutarch and with other students, including Hierocles of
Alexandria, also destined to become a prominent Platonist philosopher.
Upon Plutarch&rsquo;s death in 432, Syrianus inherited the house and
assumed leadership of the Academy, continuing its teaching tradition.
In 430/1, Proclus (412&ndash;485) arrived in Athens to join the
School, first as a student of Plutarch for about two years, then of
Syrianus for about five. Syrianus quickly recognized Proclus as the
ideal disciple and successor he had long sought. Thus, upon
Syrianus&rsquo; death, probably in 437 (cf. Saffrey-Westerink 1968:
XVI), Proclus, at only about twenty-six, became Syrianus&rsquo;
scholarch successor and inherited Plutarch&rsquo;s house.
Concurrently, two other students of Syrianus, Domninus of Larissa,
especially versed in mathematics, and Hermias of Alexandria, author of
the only extant ancient commentary on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Phaedrus</em>
(see below &sect;3.2.4), left Athens for their hometowns.</p>

<p>
Syrianus was buried in a two-place vault on the slopes of Mount
Lycabettus (eastern suburb of Athens), where he also arranged for
Proclus to be interred (cf. Marinus, <em>Proclus</em>,
&sect;36.24&ndash;34, p. 42 S.-S.). Proclus&rsquo; epitaph for
Syrianus, later added to the vault, eloquently testifies to their bond
and shared intellectual purpose:</p>

<blockquote>
I, Proclus, a Lycian by birth, Syrianus
<br />
Here nurtured me to succeed him in his teaching;
<br />
The common tomb here received our two bodies:
<br />
May a single abode welcome our souls as well.
<br />
(Marinus, <em>Proclus</em>, &sect;36.37&ndash;42, p. 43 S.&ndash;S.;
cf. Gelzer 1966; there is also an epigraphic epigram on Syrianus,
discovered in 2003 on a reused stone not far from the Lycabettus, cf.
Agosti 2008).</blockquote>

<p>
Evidence suggests Syrianus, depicted by Damascius as a strikingly
handsome and tall man with impressive intellectual powers (fr.
47.1&ndash;9, p.138 A.), may have been married and had a son,
Alexander, to whom Syrianus&rsquo; commentary on Hermogenes of
Tarsus&rsquo; <em>On Types of Style</em> (assuming Syrianus&rsquo;
authorship of it, see below) is dedicated (the information finds some
support in a <em>Scholium</em> on John Tzetzes&rsquo;
<em>Chiliades,</em> mentioning &ldquo;the son of Syrianus&rdquo;, cf.
Goulet 2016). Damascius mentions two other (unspecified) kinship
relations: with the grammarian Ammonianus (<em>Life of Isidore</em>,
fr. 47, p. 138 A.) and one Aedesia (fr. 56, p. 156 A.), praised as
&ldquo;the most beautiful and noble of the Alexandrian women&rdquo;
(fr. 56.23, p. 156 A.; tr. A.). Syrianus would have liked to betroth
Aedesia to Proclus. But the latter remained a bachelor, and she
married Hermias of Alexandria instead.</p>

<h4>1.1.2 Teaching activity</h4>

<p>
Syrianus led the Academy for five years (432&ndash;7), instructing
distinguished students such as the aforementioned Domninus and
Hermias. His most illustrious pupil, however, was Proclus, whose
commentaries and systematic works profoundly shaped later philosophy.
The bond between Proclus and Syrianus was exceptionally strong,
mirroring that between Syrianus and Plutarch. Syrianus recognized
Proclus as the sole heir capable of advancing his and Plutarch&rsquo;s
philosophical legacy (cf. Marinus, <em>Proclus</em> &sect;
12.31&ndash;6, p. 15 S.&ndash;S.). Proclus, in turn, consistently
referred to Syrianus with deep respect, as &ldquo;our guide&rdquo;,
&ldquo;our teacher&rdquo; (cf. Luna-Segonds 2007: LXVI&ndash;LXVIII),
and even &ldquo;our father&rdquo; (cf. e.g. Proclus, <em>On
Plato&rsquo;s Parmenides</em> [<em>in Prm.</em>] VII 1142.11, p. 15
Luna-Segonds [L.-S.]), and praised him extensively in his writings
(cf. e.g. <em>Platonic Theology</em> [<em>TP</em>] I 1, p. 7.1&ndash;8
Saffrey&ndash;Westerink [S.-W.]; <em>in Prm.</em> I
617.21&ndash;618.13, pp. 1&ndash;2 L.-S.).</p>

<p>
Syrianus&rsquo; teaching approach, consistent with the Imperial-age
tendency, heavily emphasized the reading and exegesis of classical
philosophical texts, particularly by Plato and Aristotle. He pursued
this task with remarkable intensity. Marinus, in his account of
Proclus&rsquo; education (cf. <em>Proclus</em>, &sect;13, pp.
15&ndash;6 S.-S.), highlights Syrianus&rsquo;&nbsp;rigorous
methodology: after Plutarch&rsquo;s introductory lessons on works like
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De anima</em> and Plato&rsquo;s <em>Phaedo</em>,
Syrianus subjected Proclus to a far more demanding and systematic
philosophical training. In under two years, they comprehensively
studied almost the entire Aristotelian corpus, covering
&ldquo;Aristotle&rsquo;s treatises on logic, ethics, politics, physics
and &hellip; theological science&rdquo; (i.e. metaphysics, see below
&sect;3.1), presumably in that order, confirmed by passages of
Syrianus&rsquo; <em>Metaphysics</em> commentary (cf. 80.5&ndash;7
Kroll, where politics, however, is not mentioned).</p>

<p>
This intensive study of Aristotle served as a propaedeutic for
understanding the &ldquo;higher mysteries&rdquo; of Plato&rsquo;s
dialogues (read following the so-called &ldquo;Iamblichus&rsquo;
canon&rdquo;, cf. Festugi&egrave;re 1966) and, ultimately, the
<em>Orphic Poems</em> and <em>Chaldaean Oracles</em>. Building on the
work of Neoplatonist predecessors like Porphyry and Iamblichus,
Syrianus firmly integrated Aristotle into the philosophical
curriculum, structuring it as an ascending intellectual and spiritual
journey. Crucially, this did not imply that Syrianus believed their
doctrines were in complete agreement.</p>

<h3 id="Wor">1.2 Works</h3>

<h4>1.2.1 The surviving (non-fragmentary) works</h4>

<p>
Only the following two works of Syrianus have come down to us in a
non-fragmentary form:</p>

<p>
<strong>Commentary on Books III, IV, XIII, and XIV of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em></strong>
<br />
<em><u>Nature of the work.</u></em> This is one of the very few extant
ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>,
along with those of Alexander of Aphrodisias and of Asclepius of
Tralles (overview: Luna 2003). Notably, it is one of only two written
by a Neoplatonist (with Asclepius&rsquo;, of which Syrianus&rsquo; and
Alexander&rsquo;s were the main sources, see below), and the only one
that fields a sustained critical engagement with Aristotle. The
commentary does not offer a unified and comprehensive interpretation
of the <em>Metaphysics</em>. It covers only four books and presents
itself as a collection of three separate essays of quite different
character and purpose, respectively on <em>Beta</em>, <em>Gamma</em>,
and <em>Mu</em> and <em>Nu</em>. The titles of these separate parts
(regardless of whether they are Syrianus&rsquo; own) already mark the
differences:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>The first essay is entitled &ldquo;Syrianus, the Son of
Philoxenus, on the Problems raised in a verbal way in Book
<em>Beta</em> of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>, and deemed in
need of arbitration&rdquo;. It begins, unusually, with no introductory
remarks, except a swift recapitulation of the subject matter of books
I and II. Typically, Syrianus goes through the <em>aporiae</em> raised
by Aristotle on the subject matter and methodology of &ldquo;first
philosophy&rdquo;, one by one, and in each case explains briefly how
he thinks these difficulties ought to be resolved, <em>not</em> how
Aristotle (supposedly) resolves them in subsequent books of the
<em>Metaphysics</em>.</li>

<li>The second, concise essay is entitled &ldquo;A Course
(<em>ephodos</em>) by Syrianus, the Son of Philoxenus, on Book
<em>Gamma</em> of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>&rdquo;.
Syrianus discusses the main topics of the book (the subject of first
philosophy, being and its <em>per se</em> attributes, the Principles
of Non-Contradiction and the Excluded Middle) but keeps his comments
short because, as he says, of the &ldquo;adequate explanations
provided by the most industrious Alexander (of Aphrodisias)&rdquo;
(54.12&ndash;3 Kroll).</li>

<li>The third treatise is entitled &ldquo;Investigations
(<em>episkepseis</em>) by Syrianus, the Son of Philoxenus, into the
Difficulties Aristotle Raises About Mathematics and Numbers in Books
<em>Mu</em> and <em>Nu</em> of the <em>Metaphysics</em>&rdquo;. This
is a long defense of Platonism and Pythagoreanism against
Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism and is a most instructive part of
Syrianus&rsquo; work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The question arises whether Syrianus also commented on other books.
The last lines of the extant text (cf. 195.10&ndash;3) suggest that he
did not comment on Book I, since he states that the discussion of
Aristotle&rsquo;s criticisms of the Platonists and the Pythagoreans in
Books XIII and XIV would allow one to answer those in Book I as well.
So the commentary was intended to be selective. But this does not
entail that what we have is complete. Asclepius gives two quotations
from Syrianus concerning Book Z (cf. Asclepius, <em>On
Aristotle&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em> 433.9&ndash;436.6, 450.18&ndash;28
Hayduck), but these may have issued from an oral course and not from a
commentary and are testimonies and not fragments (cf. Cardullo 1993;
Luna 2001: 173&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
<em><u>History of the text and translations</u></em><u>.</u> The
commentary is transmitted in 35 manuscripts. The source of the entire
manuscript tradition is the <em>Parisinus Coislinianus</em> 161 (14th
century). The <em>editio princeps</em> is H. Usener&rsquo;s and
appeared in 1870 in volume V of the Bekker edition of
Aristotle&rsquo;s works. A later edition, which remains standard, is
due to W. Kroll, published in 1902 for the <em>Commentaria in
Aristotelem Graeca</em> series (vol. VI 1). A new edition (with French
translation and notes) is in preparation for the <em>Collection des
Universit&eacute;s de France</em> (aka <em>Collection
Bud&eacute;</em>) by C. Luna, C. D&rsquo;Ancona, and J.-P. Schneider.
It promises to improve on the earlier editions in many respects,
including as regards the citation of the Aristotelian lemmas, which
Syrianus transcribes in full but both Usener and Kroll have shortened,
citing only the beginning and end, and sometimes not even printing
them as lemmas, but in spaced characters <em>within</em> the
commentary, as if they were quotations (cf. Luna 2004 and 2007).</p>

<p>
There are two translations: a Latin one (of books III, XIII and XIV
only) by Gerolamo Bagolino (ca. end 15th cent. &ndash; &dagger; 1552),
a Veronese physician and professor of philosophy in Padua and
translator of works by Aristotle and some of his commentators. This
translation was published in 1558 in Venice and based on a now lost
manuscript. More recently, J. Dillon and D. O&rsquo;Meara have
produced a translation into English, published in two volumes, in 2006
(books XIII and XIV) and 2008 (books III and IV) for the <em>Ancient
Commentators on Aristotle</em> series (this translation will be used,
with modifications, in the rest of this entry). There may also have
been an Arabic translation of the commentary on Book B, cf. Ibn
al-Nad&#299;m, <em>Kit&#257;b al-Fihrist</em>,
251.30&ndash;252.1 Fl&uuml;gel = 312.17 Tajaddud.</p>

<p>
<em><u>Relationship with Alexander, Asclepius, and
Ps.-Alexander.</u></em> Alexander of Aphrodisias&rsquo;
<em>Metaphysics</em> commentary is Syrianus&rsquo; main source for the
literal exegesis of the <em>Metaphysics</em> books he comments on.
Concetta Luna (2001: 72&ndash;9) has identified 51 quotations (17
explicit, 34 implicit) from Alexander in
Syrianus&rsquo;&nbsp;commentary, suggesting that Syrianus had
Alexander&rsquo;s commentary at hand. This does not mean that Syrianus
simply repeats Alexander. Indeed, the former&rsquo;s commentary also
has critical aims, aimed at defending Platonism, and is not limited to
literal exegesis. Alexander and Syrianus together then constitute the
main sources of Asclepius of Tralles&rsquo; commentary (cf. again Luna
2001: 99&ndash;186). Both Syrianus and Asclepius know
Alexander&rsquo;s commentary in its entirety. We instead read only
that to the first five books. The commentary on books VI&ndash;XIV
transmitted to us under Alexander&rsquo;s name is actually spurious,
thus standardly referred to as Ps.-Alexander. Now, the commentaries of
Syrianus and Ps.-Alexander on Books XIII and XIV contain a number of
common passages. This raises the question of their relationship. The
traditional view, established by Praechter 1906, identifies
Ps.-Alexander with Michael of Ephesus (12<sup>th</sup> cent.) and
implies that Syrianus was the source of Ps.-Alexander.
<em>Contra</em>, Tar&aacute;n 1987 defended the inverse relationship
and argued that Ps.-Alexander was an earlier author than Syrianus and
his source. This position is refuted by Luna 2001, which confirms the
traditional interpretation with new arguments.</p>

<p>
<strong>Commentaries on Hermogenes of Tarsus&rsquo; <em>On Types of
Style</em> and <em>On Issues</em> </strong>
<br />
<em><u>Nature of the work and history of the text</u></em><u>.</u>
These are commentaries on two popular rhetorical treatises by
Hermogenes of Tarsus, a major rhetorician of the
2<sup>nd</sup>&ndash;3<sup>rd</sup> century, C.E. More particularly,
the <em>On Issues</em> commentary divides up into two parts: a
lemmatic commentary on chapters 1&ndash;11 of <em>On Issues</em>, and
an independent non-lemmatic exposition of the fourteen
Hermogenes&rsquo; &ldquo;issues&rdquo;. Both commentaries have been
transmitted by two manuscripts, the <em>Marcianus graecus</em> 433 (M)
and the <em>Messanensis S. Salv.</em> 118 (S) both from the
11<sup>th</sup> century. For the <em>On Issues</em> commentary, we
should add a compilation of lemmatic <em>scholia</em>, preserved in
the <em>Parisinus graecus</em> 2923 (P), also from the 11<sup>th</sup>
century. According to the latest editor of the work (Patillon 2021)
these <em>scholia</em> transmit a distinct work, a proto-commentary
<em>On Issues</em> (for criticisms see Luna 2023). The <em>editio
princeps</em> of Syrianus&rsquo; commentaries on <em>On Types of
Style</em> and <em>On Issues</em> (without the <em>scholia</em>) is
Rabe 1892, which remains standard for the <em>On Types of Style</em>
commentary; that of the <em>scholia</em> is Walz 1832&ndash;6, vol.
IV. For the <em>On Issues</em> commentary and the <em>scholia</em> the
reference edition is now Patillon 2021 (on which cf. again Luna
2023).</p>

<p>
<em><u>Authorship.</u></em> Syrianus is referenced as
&ldquo;<em>sophist&#275;s</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;rhethorician&rdquo;) in
the title of both commentaries, and the style of the latter seems
quite different from that of the <em>Metaphysics</em>. It has
therefore been doubted whether Syrianus the <em>sophist&#275;s</em>
was the same as Syrianus the <em>philosophos</em> (cf. recently
Caluori 2012: 57&ndash;62). But the term
&ldquo;<em>sophist&#275;s</em>&rdquo; has no negative meaning in the
commentaries on Hermogenes, where indeed rhetoric and philosophy are
linked. References to and citations from philosophical works abound
(Plato, minor Platonists, Aristotle), and there are no good reasons to
doubt that this commentary was written by Syrianus the Neoplatonist
(cf. Luna 2016: 702&ndash;3; Patillon 2021: XI&ndash;XII).</p>

<h4>1.2.2 Other works</h4>

<p>
<em><u>The problem of the Suda&rsquo;s two lists.</u></em> Apart from
these commentaries, there is evidence for a much broader literary
output. But it is not easy to determine exactly everything Syrianus
wrote. The <em>Suda</em> (&Sigma; 1662, IV 478.23&ndash;479.2 Adler)
attributes to him: seven books of commentary on Homer; four on the
<em>Republic</em>; two <em>On the Theology of Orpheus</em>; a treatise
<em>On the Homeric Gods</em>; one <em>On the Agreement between
Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato</em> <em>with the Chaldean Oracles</em>
in ten books; and other unspecified exegetical works. This list is
surely incomplete because it fails to mention any work on Aristotle.
Further, the <em>Suda</em> attributes the same list of works, with
minor differences, also to Proclus (cf. &Pi; 2473, IV 210.8&ndash;13
Adler), posing a problem of attribution that has predictably divided
scholars. Virtually all available interpretative options have been
entertained, and no scholarly agreement has been reached: some believe
that the real author is Proclus and the attribution to Syrianus is
false (Zeller 1903: 820&ndash;4): others that the real author is
Syrianus and the attribution to Proclus is false (Praechter 1926);
others that the two may have written works with the same title
(Sheppard 1980: 46); others that Proclus took up and revised works by
Syrianus, notably on the <em>Orphic Poems</em> and <em>On the
Agreement between Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato with the Caldean
Oracles</em> (Saffrey 1992).</p>

<p>
<em><u>A reconstruction of Syrianus&rsquo; bibliography and his works
survived in fragments.</u></em> The reconstruction of the full list of
Syrianus&rsquo; writings is therefore no easy task. On the other hand,
Syrianus&rsquo; works, especially his commentaries, were greatly
admired by later generations of Neoplatonists (Isidore and Damascius
regarded him as one of the best exegetes), and he is therefore often
referred to and quoted. Thanks also to the careful study of this
external evidence, we can draw a list of works attributable to
Syrianus with reasonable certainty (cf. Luna 2016: 686&ndash;702).</p>

<h2 id="SyrHisLatNeoAri">2. Syrianus, the history of late Neoplatonism, and Aristotle</h2>

<h3 id="SyrPlaGreNeo">2.1 Syrianus&rsquo; place in Greek Neoplatonism</h3>

<p>
Syrianus was a pivotal figure in late ancient philosophy. He
established standard philosophical views distinctive of the later
Greek Neoplatonists, especially Athenian. He also considerably
bolstered Aristotle&rsquo;s position as their primary philosophical
interlocutor (besides Plato) and a central authority in their
educational curriculum. Furthermore, Syrianus was the unified root
from which both the main late ancient philosophical schools, those of
Athens and Alexandria, branched off.</p>

<p>
The second scholarch (or &lsquo;successor&rsquo;, in the terminology
of the School) of the refounded Academy, Syrianus advanced
Plutarch&rsquo;s project to renew Athenian Platonism after a stagnant
phase in the 4<sup>th</sup> century. Plutarch pursued that project by
drawing inspiration from Iamblichus&rsquo; legacy (cf. Praechter 1910;
Saffrey-Westerink 1968: XXXV&ndash;XLVIII; Goulet 2012). He promoted a
radical theological reading of the <em>Parmenides</em> (see below
&sect;3.2) and an in-depth comparison between Plato and Aristotle,
recognizing the latter&rsquo;s prominent role in the Neoplatonist
educational path, as evidenced by his <em>De anima</em> commentary
(cf. Luna-Segonds 2012: 1090&ndash;1091) and the start of his teaching
of Proclus with the <em>De anima</em> and the <em>Phaedo</em> (cf.
Marinus, <em>Proclus</em> &sect;12.9&ndash;15, p. 15 S.-S.). Syrianus
advanced Plutarch&rsquo;s project with unprecedented rigor and
breadth: (1) He fleshed out the theological interpretation of
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em> with remarkable sophistication,
thereby spelling a new yardstick of Platonic exegesis. This
interpretation, as we know of it especially from Proclus&rsquo;
monumental commentary on the dialogue, became the backbone of
subsequent Neoplatonist philosophical elaboration, making Syrianus a
fundamental source for later Neoplatonist doctrines (cf. esp. Luna
2000a and D&rsquo;Ancona 2000a). (2) He engaged with Aristotle&rsquo;s
works with novel meticulousness, acknowledging their decisive
philosophical and pedagogical importance for Platonism (see below
&sect;2.2). He read with Proclus all Aristotle&rsquo;s writings in
under two years (see above &sect;1.1). He studied the Peripatetic
commentary tradition, notably on the <em>Metaphysics</em>, in greater
depth, of course with special attention to its most authoritative
representative, Alexander of Aphrodisias (cf. esp. Luna 2000b, 2001,
and D&rsquo;Ancona 2000b). More importantly, unlike Plutarch&rsquo;s
more conciliatory attitude, Syrianus approached Aristotelian texts,
notably in his <em>Metaphysics</em> commentary, to show systematically
the superiority of Platonism and its immunity from Aristotelian
criticisms (particularly in Books XIII and XIV of the
<em>Metaphysics</em>). This commentary stands as a crucial document
for understanding the reception of Aristotle in late Neoplatonism (cf.
again D&rsquo;Ancona 2000b). Overall, we can say that Plutarch gave
impetus to a fundamental project to renew Platonism; Syrianus advanced
this project decisively and with unprecedented thoroughness and rigor;
Proclus brought it to completion with unparalleled systematicity. With
respect to this trajectory, Damascius can be seen as a critical and
aporetic reflection on Proclus (cf. Opsomer 2014).</p>

<p>
Syrianus also embodies the unified historical root from which both the
Athenian and Alexandrian philosophical schools developed (cf. Frede
2009: 23&ndash;7). He directly ruled the Athenian school, before
Proclus brought it to its peak. The Alexandrian school, on the other
hand, received a major input from Ammonius, the son of Hermias,
Syrianus&rsquo; direct pupil. After his master&rsquo;s death, Hermias
returned to his (and Syrianus&rsquo;) hometown Alexandria and began
teaching there. At the appropriate age, Ammonius himself was sent to
study under Proclus in Athens, where he presumably absorbed further
views ultimately rooted in Syrianus&rsquo;&nbsp;teachings. Upon his
return to Alexandria, he took Hermias&rsquo; place following the
latter&rsquo;s untimely death, and trained major Alexandrian
Neoplatonists, including Damascius, Simplicius, Asclepius,
Olympiodorus, and Philoponus. Damascius and Simplicius would then
later move to Athens until the school&rsquo;s closure in 529
(Damascius was the last diadochus).</p>

<h3 id="SyrAttTowAri">2.2 Syrianus&rsquo; attitude towards Aristotle</h3>

<p>
In a seminal 1910 study, Karl Praechter drew some fundamental
distinctions between the Athenian and Alexandrian schools. Among these
were contrary stances toward Aristotle: hostile for the Athenians,
conciliatory for the Alexandrians. Syrianus&rsquo;
<em>Metaphysics</em> commentary, with its combative and polemical tone
(cf. Dillon-O&rsquo;Meara 2006: 11&ndash;20), seems to give strong
<em>prima facie</em> support to this picture. In this light, Syrianus
appears as an uncompromising opponent of Aristotle, uniquely committed
to attacking him and defending Plato, the custodian of philosophical
truth, against his wayward pupil. Yet closer analysis reveals a more
complex scenario. The interplay between the two schools was less
clear-cut than Praechter allowed. Ties of discipleship and kinship
complicate rigid divisions (cf. Hadot 1990). Without discounting
Praechter&rsquo;s influential reconstruction (cf. D&rsquo;Ancona
2005), a more nuanced view is needed, including for Syrianus.</p>

<p>
A staunch defender of Plato against Aristotle, Syrianus departs from
the conciliatory Porphyrean-Iamblichean approach. Instead of stressing
common ground, he attacks Aristotle&rsquo;s anti-Platonist objections
as ineffective and often dictated by misunderstandings, unable to rise
beyond a physicalist perspective to an adequate understanding of the
first principles of reality. Compared to the &ldquo;divine&rdquo;
nature of Platonists and Pythagoreans, Aristotle&rsquo;s is only
&ldquo;daimonic&rdquo; (cf. e.g. <em>On Aristotle&rsquo;s
Metaphysics</em> [hereafter, references to Syrianus are to this work,
except otherwise noted] 86.7, 115.25, 168.6, 192.16 Kroll;
O&rsquo;Meara 1989: 123).</p>

<p>
Still, Syrianus&rsquo; stance is not purely polemical. As we have
seen, he assigned Aristotle a major pedagogical role: his educational
programme for Proclus began with the full Aristotelian corpus. This
presupposed some shared philosophical framework &ndash; which did not
prevent disagreements on specific issues (cf. Gerson 2005; Menn 2012:
45&ndash;6). the keynote programmatic declaration prefacing
Syrianus&rsquo; commentary on <em>Metaphysics</em> XIII and XIV, first
brought to scholarly attention by Saffrey (1987) and much studied
since (cf. Longo 2001; Frede 2009; Helmig 2009; d&rsquo;Hoine 2016;
Golitsis 2018). There Syrianus calls for &ldquo;judicious and
impartial examination&rdquo; of Aristotle&rsquo;s misconceived and
unjustified criticisms of Plato, while also declaring himself
Aristotle&rsquo;s disciple in logic, physics, and ethics, and even
hailing him a &ldquo;benefactor of humanity&rdquo; (80.14), for the
wealth of &ldquo;apt remarks, accompanied by demonstrations of the
highest quality&rdquo; that he has set forth &ldquo;in the excellent
work&rdquo; (80.9&ndash;10: <em>en&nbsp;t&#275;i tele&#333;tat&#275;i
pragmateiai taut&#275;i</em>) that he thinks the <em>Metaphysics</em>
is. The rhetorical pitch of this <em>captatio benevolentiae</em> is
patent, but it would be unfair to dismiss it as insincere. Syrianus is
a committed Platonist, but one who engages with Aristotle seriously.
He prioritizes substantive argumentation over simple controversy,
putting his finger on what he saw as tensions and weaknesses and
arguing that their resolution required Platonism, above all,
recognition of the One as the superessential first principle, which
Aristotle denies (cf. 118.21&ndash;2): &ldquo;For if this proposition
is adequately established, it seems that Aristotle will be in
agreement with all the genuine doctrines of Pythagoras and
Plato&rdquo; (141.13&ndash;5).</p>

<h2 id="Met">3. Metaphysics</h2>

<h3 id="SyrConMet">3.1 Syrianus&rsquo; conception of metaphysics</h3>

<p>
The title <em>Metaphysics</em> (<em>ta meta ta physika</em>), unknown
to Aristotle and attested since the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE (cf.
Brisson 1999: 44&ndash;50), appears in Syrianus only in the headings
of his three-pronged <em>Metaphysics</em> commentary. He rather
references the work as &ldquo;theological treatise&rdquo; (80.17:
<em>t&#275;s theologik&#275;s pragmateias</em>; cf. Ammonius, <em>On
Aristotle&rsquo;s De Interpretatione</em> 27.32&ndash;33 Busse;
Philoponus, <em>On Aristotle&rsquo;s On the Soul</em>
518.36&ndash;519.1 Hayduck; Elias, <em>Introduction to Philosophy</em>
20.21&ndash;22 Busse; with Napoli 2012), a label based on
<em>Metaphysics</em> VI 1 and germane, as we shall see, to
Syrianus&rsquo; view of the object of metaphysics. Nowhere in Syrianus
&ndash; or in ancient Greek literature generally (cf. Brisson 1999:
37&ndash;43) &ndash; does the substantivized adjective
<em>metaphysics</em> (<em>metaphysik&#275;</em>) occur. Yet clearly
Syrianus conceives a distinct metaphysical science, which he calls
indifferently &ldquo;first philosophy&rdquo;, &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;theological science&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
This emerges especially from Syrianus&rsquo; commentary on
<em>Metaphysics</em> IV 1&ndash;2. There Syrianus endorses most of
Aristotle&rsquo;s pronouncements, including that there is a science of
being <em>qua</em> being (as well as its <em>per se</em> accidents and
the principles of demonstrations),&nbsp;and that this is primarily the
science of substance (<em>ousia</em>), because being is said in many
ways but substance is primary among them, as all other beings are said
to be by reference to (<em>pros</em>) it. But while approving of the
letter of Aristotle&rsquo;s text, Syrianus twists its spirit, aligning
first philosophy with dialectic as in <em>Republic</em> VI&ndash;VII,
a move with a long afterlife (cf. Courtine 2005: 59).</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Object</h4>

<p>
Syrianus accepts that being is said in many ways, but &ldquo;by
derivation from and reference to one thing&rdquo; (55.1:
<em>aph&rsquo;henos kai pros hen</em>, cf. Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> I 4.1096b27&ndash;8; Alexander of Aphrodisias, <em>On
Aristotle&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em> 241.3&ndash;5 Hayduck; more later),
namely substance, from which all other things &ldquo;receive
being&rdquo; (55.10). But he identifies <em>ousia</em> with Being
itself (55.8: <em>autoon</em>), the monad of Being which Syrianus also
identifies with the supreme genus of Being of Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Sophist</em>.</p>

<p>
Against Aristotle&rsquo;s denial of such a genus (cf. e.g.
<em>Topics</em> IV 6.127a26&ndash;39; <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>
11.172a13&ndash;15; <em>Posterior Analytics</em> II 7.92b14;
<em>Metaphysics</em> III 3.998b22&ndash;28; VIII 6.1045a36&ndash;b7;
XI 1.1059b31&ndash;4), Syrianus argues (building on Peripatetic
debates on specific difference and Alexander of Aphrodisias&rsquo;
negative judgement about this argument, cf. his <em>On
Aristotle&rsquo;s Metaphysics</em> 206.12&ndash;207.6 Hayduck,
176.17&ndash;177.17 Golitsis) that the prohibition applies to being
only as one of the&nbsp;&ldquo;later-born&rdquo;
(<em>hysterogenes</em>) logical genera, i.e. universals posterior to
and mentally abstracted from particulars (<em>post rem</em>), not to
metaphysical genera, which are productive causes of what falls under
them and form with it a series ordered according to priority and
posteriority (cf. Granieri 2022: 230&ndash;5). Thus, Being itself, the
monad and supreme genus of being, secures unity to both being and its
science and bestows being in degrees (cf. 56.14; Proclus, <em>in
Prm.</em> I 704.1&ndash;12, p. 117 L.-S., 704.1&ndash;9, p. 101 Steel
<em>et al.</em>) to everything else, primarily on intelligible
substances, the original articulation of Being itself, which is their
unity (cf. 85.12&ndash;4). This leads Syrianus to interpret
&ldquo;being <em>qua</em> being&rdquo; in two complementary ways: as
Being itself, the monad or supreme genus of being from which all
beings proceed; and as the substantial intelligible beings in which
Being itself articulates (cf. Steel 2005: 7). That is why, in
identifying the subject of first philosophy, Syrianus swings between
these two referents: Being itself or intelligible Substance (cf. e.g.
55.8, 58.13&ndash;4: <em>autoon</em>, <em>no&#275;t&#275;
ousia</em>&mdash;both picking up <em>to pr&#333;t&#333;s on</em> at
11.9&ndash;31) and primary being<em>s</em> or intelligible
substance<em>s</em> (cf. 57.23&ndash;4: <em>ta pr&#333;t&#333;s
onta</em>, <em>ousiai</em>) proceeding from it, &ldquo;beings which by
nature belong to themselves and exist by themselves&rdquo; (56.6). In
this framework, then, &ldquo;being <em>qua</em> being&rdquo; no longer
refers, like in Aristotle, to every and any being, considered simply
as being, but to an absolute or unqualified being, a being that is
purely being, i.e.&nbsp;intelligible being. Aristotelian first
philosophy thus becomes a theological science of divine essences,
close to Platonic dialectic (cf. Verbeke 1981: 123; O&rsquo;Meara
1986: 5&ndash;7; Steel 2005; Bonelli 2009; Van Campe 2009:
271&ndash;9; note that Proclus, <em>On Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</em>
9.19&ndash;10.14 Friedlein claims dialectic to be the science of being
<em>qua</em> being). Its primary object is being <em>qua</em> being,
i.e.&nbsp;divine, intelligible, real beings proceeding from Being
itself, and forming with it the second level of the metaphysical
hierarchy, described by the second hypothesis of Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Parmenides</em> (see below).</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Primacy</h4>

<p>
The existence and eminence of metaphysical science follows from those
of its object: Being itself is being to the highest degree
(<em>malista on</em>), and &ldquo;the best of whatever is in any
respect&rdquo;, so it cannot remain unknown and is rather the object
of the highest cognition (<em>malista gn&#333;sis</em>) (cf.
54.20&ndash;55.16; cp. <em>Metaphysics</em> II.2.997b27&ndash;30,
cited by Syrianus, and already Plato, <em>Republic</em> V. 477a3; and
<em>Philebus</em> 59a7&ndash;c6). Yet while Aristotle thought that
being and unity are the same and one in nature (cf.
<em>Metaphysics</em> IV 2.1003b22&ndash;3), in Syrianus&rsquo;
(distinctively Neoplatonist) view, unity is more fundamental than
being (cf. 59.13&ndash;60.26 with Schneider 2009), and the One, i.e.
the Good (cf. e.g. 112.14&ndash;15 and Steel 1989), is &ldquo;beyond
being, transcending all beings in its simplicity and inconceivable
excellences, which it is impossible to name properly&rdquo;
(11.21&ndash;3, based on Plato, <em>Republic</em> VI.509b9) and
therefore worthier than it. So should the first science not be of the
One-Good instead of Being? Plato&rsquo;s claim that the Good is the
highest object of knowledge (<em>Republic</em> VI.505a2&ndash;4) seems
to suggest as much. But no, replies Syrianus: we should distinguish
between a Good coordinate to other Forms and a superessential Good,
the first principle of all and summit of the metaphysical hierarchy
(cf. e.g. Proclus, <em>On Plato&rsquo;s Republic</em> I
278.22&ndash;279.2 Kroll; <em>TP</em> II 7, p. 46.13&ndash;20
S.&ndash;W.); the latter &ldquo;is unknowable and above all science,
as Plato clearly proclaims in the <em>Parmenides</em> [142a4&ndash;5],
whereas the passage cited from the <em>Republic</em> speaks rather of
the Form of the Good which is seen in and with beings&rdquo; (cf.
55.16&ndash;33, with Steel 1999; also C&ocirc;t&eacute; 2003 for
Syrianus&rsquo; use of Plato&rsquo;s divided line in this and other
passages of his commentary). In themselves, the One and its powers,
the so-called &ldquo;henads&rdquo; (see below), transcend all
knowledge and naming (cf. Proclus, <em>Elements of Theology</em>
[<em>ET</em>], prop. &sect;162, pp. 140&ndash;3 Dodds). The subject of
metaphysical science, i.e. theology, is Being.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 <em>Pros hen</em> relation</h4>

<p>
Being itself confers being to everything else, but unequally.
Intelligibles are primary; sensibles mere accidents of the former.
Syrianus thus transposes Aristotle&rsquo;s substance-accident relation
into a model-copy relation (cf. 114.35&ndash;115.3 and Opsomer 2004:
40&ndash;1). Since the copy depends upon the model, both copy and
model are said to <em>be</em> homonymously, but the priority of the
model guarantees unity in homonymy. The difference with
Aristotle&rsquo;s own view is marked. For Aristotle, non-substances
are said <em>pros</em> substances referentially; for Syrianus,
substance is the generative cause of non-substances (cf. Courtine
2005: 191&ndash;230). His revision of the <em>pros hen</em> relation
makes it close to synonymy, as he realizes (cf. 57.16&ndash;21), but
he justifies it by redefining genus as productive principle and making
room for quasi-synonymic polyvocals: beings are not equal and cannot
be pure synonyms, yet all can still fall under Being as their common
cause.</p>

<h3 id="MetHie">3.2 Metaphysical hierarchy</h3>

<p>
Along with various other Neoplatonists, Syrianus is a principle
monist: all reality unfolds through a dynamic process of derivation
from a single unitary principle, whose products possess decreasing
degrees of unity. This &ldquo;procession&rdquo; (81.34:
<em>proodos</em>) follows a divine order symbolically revealed in the
second part of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Parmenides</em>. Syrianus champions
therefore a <em>theological</em> reading of this controversial text
(cf. Saffrey 1984a; Steel 2002, 2009: 201&ndash;5; Fauquier 2018). He
interprets it as describing the dynamic constitution of reality,
rather than a mere logical exercise (cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> I
640.16&ndash;641.5, pp. 32&ndash;3 L.-S. = Syrianus, <em>in Prm.</em>
fr. 1 Klitenic Wear [KW]). Unfortunately, Syrianus&rsquo;
<em>Parmenides</em> commentary survives only in fragments, mostly
collected by Klitenic Wear 2011 (cf. Luna 2016: 692&ndash;5 for
supplements). Many are preserved in the <em>Parmenides</em> commentary
and the <em>Platonic Theology</em> of Proclus, who stresses that
Syrianus solved the main exegetical difficulties and declares himself
to closely follow the master (cf. e.g. <em>in Prm.</em> I
618.3&ndash;13, p. 2 L.-S.; <em>TP</em> I 1, p. 7.1&ndash;17, III 23,
p. 83.13&ndash;18 S.-W.; also Marinus, <em>Proclus</em>
&sect;13.10&ndash;7, p. 16 S.-S.; further references in Luna 2016:
693&ndash;4), so that &ldquo;it is almost impossible to distinguish
between Proclus&rsquo; original contribution and what he adopted from
Syrianus&rdquo; (Steel-Helmig 2020: &sect;1.1).</p>

<p>
For Syrianus the second part of the <em>Parmenides</em> consists of
<em>nine</em> hypotheses (cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI
1052.15&ndash;31 [on the meaning of &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo;],
1053.16&ndash;8, 1061.20&ndash;1064.12, pp. 22&ndash;24, 35&ndash;9
L.-S.), a view shared by most Neoplatonists (cf. Saffrey-Westerink
1968: LXXV&ndash;LXXXIX; Luna-Segonds 2017: XII&ndash;XXIV; exceptions
include Amelius, who counted eight, and &ldquo;the philosopher of
Rhodes&rdquo; (identified by Saffrey 1984b, 1994 with Theodorus of
Asine, but cf. Luna-Segonds 2017: 220&ndash;25) who counted ten, cf.
Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1052.32&ndash;1053.8, 1057.6&ndash;1058.3, pp.
23&ndash;4, 29&ndash;30 L.-S.), whereas modern commentators generally
count eight series of deductions. Following Plutarch of Athens (cf.
Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1058.22&ndash;1061.19, pp. 31&ndash;5
L.-S. = Plutarch, fr. 62 Taormina), Syrianus holds that the first five
hypotheses, assuming the existence of the One, draw true conclusions,
whereas the latter four, assuming the non-existence of the One, yield
false ones. Thus, the first five hypotheses correspond to as many
levels of the metaphysical hierarchy; the latter four to none. This
distinguishes Syrianus&rsquo; exegesis from those of Amelius, Porphyry
and Iamblichus, who mapped each hypothesis to a metaphysical level
(cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1056.1&ndash;1057.5, pp. 28&ndash;9
L.-S.). The first hypothesis concerns the One, the first principle of
all; the second the One-Being or Being, i.e. the domain of the
intelligibles or primary being (the level of Plotinus&rsquo;
Intellect); the third the Soul; the fourth the forms in matter; the
fifth matter (cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1061.30&ndash;1064.12,
pp. 36&ndash;9 L.-S. = Syrianus, <em>in Prm.</em> fr. 3 KW).</p>

<h4>3.2.1 The One</h4>

<p>
The first two hypotheses have a symmetrical structure: virtually all
the attributes denied of the One in the first are affirmed in the
second. Syrianus, like most Neoplatonists, dissolves the antinomy (and
avoids PNC violation, cf. Steel 2004) by taking <em>to hen</em> to
have different referents: in the first, the transcendent One, first
principle of all; in the second, the One coordinate with Being. Thus,
the first hypothesis provides a negative description of the former, or
first God (cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1061.31, 1096.25&ndash;28,
pp. 36, 86 L.-S.), the absolutely simple summit of the metaphysical
hierarchy which everything proceeds from and strives to, the One taken
in itself or as &ldquo;imparticipable&rdquo; (<em>amethekton</em>).
Syrianus contrasts it with the One as it relates to other things (cf.
esp. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1114.35&ndash;1116.19, pp.
115&ndash;7 L.-S. = Syrianus, <em>in Prm.</em> fr. 4 KW), which he
also calls &ldquo;participated One&rdquo; (<em>methekton hen</em>), or
&ldquo;some One&rdquo; (<em>ti hen</em>) (<em>methekton</em>, cf.
Damascius, <em>in Prm.</em> II p. 75.18&ndash;22
Westerink-Comb&egrave;s = Syrianus, <em>in Prm.</em> fr. 12 KW; also
Proclus, <em>ET</em>, prop. &sect;116, pp. 102&ndash;3 Dodds). The
description is &ldquo;negative&rdquo; because the first hypothesis
contains only <em>negations</em> about the One&mdash;it is a
&ldquo;theological hymn to the One through negations&rdquo;, as
Proclus puts it (cf. <em>in Prm.</em> VII 1191.33&ndash;4, p. 94
L.-S.; cf. <em>TP</em> III 24, p. 83.22&ndash;5 S.-W; with van den
Berg 2001: 22&ndash;9). As maximally pure and simple, the One cannot
be thought of as having any property at all, or be the subject of any
positive propositional attribution, which would entail multiplicity
(subject plus attribute). Strictly speaking the One cannot even be
named (cf. 11.19&ndash;23), since a name would single out a particular
determination and limit the One. Hence, the One is ineffable &mdash;
and <em>this</em>, too, should not be understood as a positive
attribution, nor are the names &ldquo;One&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Good&rdquo; proper designations of the principle, but rather of
our notion of it (cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VII lat.
507.21&ndash;513.18, pp. 197&ndash;207 L.-S.). All that can be said
about the One are negations, which say nothing about it (Proclus,
<em>in Prm.</em> VII lat. 518.14&ndash;22 L.-S. &lt; Syrianus, <em>in
Prm.</em> fr. 10 KW), but only about ourselves. Given that there is a
difference between referring to the One and expressing something about
it (cf. already Plotinus, <em>Ennead</em> V 3 [49] 13.1&ndash;8
Henry-Schwyzer<sup>2</sup>), negations refer to the One but express
nothing about it (cf. again Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VII lat.
518.14&ndash;22 L.-S. &lt; Syrianus, <em>in Prm.</em> fr. 10 KW).
Occasionally Syrianus calls the One a &ldquo;cause&rdquo; (cf. 11.24;
168.2&ndash;3; 169.2&ndash;4), but this is not a positive description
of the One <em>per se</em>, but only relative to us (cf. already
Plotinus, <em>Ennead</em> VI 7 [38].25.24; 8 [39].18.38&ndash;49; 9
[9].3.49&ndash;51 Henry-Schwyzer<sup>2</sup>). Ultimately, as Proclus
stresses, silence is best (cf. <em>in Prm.</em> VII lat.
505.4&ndash;21, 521.24&ndash;30, pp. 193&ndash;4, 222 L.-S.;
<em>TP</em> III 8, p. 30.7&ndash;8 S.-W.), and, as Damascius insists,
discourse on the One remains aporetic (cf. Greig 2021).</p>

<p>
A controversial passage of Damascius&rsquo; <em>On First
Principles</em> (II 17.3&ndash;17 Westerink-Comb&egrave;s) attributes
to Syrianus the Iamblichean view that &ldquo;beyond the One
[<em>scil.</em> of the first hypothesis] there will be a unique
principle, the Ineffable&rdquo;. This would not be the subject of any
of the hypotheses. Despite Iamblichus&rsquo; influence on Syrianus
(cf. Cardullo 1993), the attribution lacks further support and is
doubtful (cf. Klitenic Wear 2011: 6, 316&ndash;8). Note that for
Iamblichus the first hypothesis concerns both the first God and all
gods (cf. Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1054.38&ndash;1055.2,
1064.21&ndash;1065.1, 1066.17&ndash;1071.4, pp. 27, 39, 42&ndash;8
L.-S.). Note also that Syrianus already deems the One of the first
hypothesis ineffable.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 The One-Being (1): attributes and henads</h4>

<p>
<em><u>The attributes of the One-Being and their order.</u></em> After
the One, Syrianus posits a pair of opposing and complementary
principles through which the One generates all reality and is present
in it in the mode proper to each (<em>ad modum recipientis</em>) (cf.
112.14&ndash;9). These principles are dubbed (more often by Syrianus)
Monad and Dyad, following <em>Metaphysics</em> XIII&ndash;XIV, or
(more often by Proclus and already by Iamblichus, cf. Damascius,
<em>On First Principles</em> II, p. 28.1&ndash;4
Westerink-Comb&egrave;s) &ldquo;Limit&rdquo; (<em>peras</em>) and
&ldquo;Unlimited&rdquo; (<em>apeiron</em>), following Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Philebus</em> (cf. Luna 2000a: 228&ndash;38). They have different
functions: the Monad-Limit, which resembles the One and has a primacy
between the two (cf. 125.29&ndash;33, 166.1&ndash;2, 167.9&ndash;10,
184.11&ndash;2; with Luna 2000a: 255&ndash;7) is responsible for
stability, permanence, unity, indivisibility, identity, similarity,
equality, paternity and masculinity; the Dyad-Unlimited, by contrast,
for procession, movement, multiplicity, division, divisibility,
otherness, dissimilarity, inequality, maternity, femininity, fertility
(cf. Sheppard 1982; Luna 2000a: 239&ndash;5; D&rsquo;Ancona
2000a).</p>

<p>
From these principles derives the second hypostatic level of reality,
described by the <em>Parmenides</em>&rsquo; second hypothesis.
Syrianus&rsquo; major innovations in the <em>Parmenides</em> exegesis
concern this and the third hypotheses. The attributes denied to the
One in the first hypothesis are affirmed in the second, which concerns
the participated One, i.e. the One-Being with all divine intelligible
beings that proceed from it (including the so-called greatest Kinds of
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Sophist</em>, such as Being and Difference, which
are therefore subordinate to Monad and Dyad, <em>pace</em> Aristotle,
<em>Metaphysics</em> XIV 2.1089a1&ndash;1090a2, cf. Granieri 2024).</p>

<p>
Proclus praises Syrianus for being the first to pay attention to the
order of the attributes of the One-Being (for the attributes before
Syrianus cf. Van Campe 2009: 253&ndash;66). This order, identical in
the two hypotheses (except that the pairs of attributes are eleven in
the first and fourteen in the second), is for Syrianus philosophically
and theologically significant (cf. Dillon 2009 and again Van Campe
2009): each pair of attributes marks a distinct level of divine
reality in descending causal order. These levels are &ldquo;orders of
gods [...] expressed [...] by means of names familiar to the
philosophers&rdquo; (Proclus, <em>in Prm.</em> VI 1061.33&ndash;6, p.
36 L.-S. &lt; Syrianus, <em>in Prm.</em> fr. 3 KW). Thus, while the
first hypothesis was a &ldquo;theological hymn to the One through
negations&rdquo;, the second is a hymn of the generation of all divine
classes (cf. Proclus<em>, TP</em> I 7, p. 31.22&ndash;7 S.-W.).
Syrianus explains these attributes by drawing from both the
<em>Parmenides</em> and the <em>Sophist</em>, and showing his
distinctive and celebrated exegetical method of treating all
Plato&rsquo;s words with utmost seriousness, to reveal their deeper,
ultimately allegorical and theological meaning (cf. Klitenic Wear
2018: esp. 477&ndash;81 on the <em>Parmenides</em>; Syrianus also
interpreted Homer allegorically and theologically, cf. Buffi&egrave;re
1956: 541&ndash;58; Manolea 2003). In doing so, he sets out an
architecture of the divine world, which, while building on earlier
Neoplatonist exegeses, achieves unprecedented complexity and
sophistication. The post-Plotinian tendency to multiply levels of
reality reaches its highest expression. More particularly, Syrianus
sees the &ldquo;spiritual realm&rdquo; as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a system of three triads of intelligible gods [<em>scil.</em> Being],
followed by three triads of intelligible-intellective gods
[<em>scil.</em> Life], followed in turn by [an hebdomad of
intellective gods [<em>scil.</em> Intellect]]&mdash;two triads and a
seventh entity, termed the &laquo;membrane&raquo;
(<em>hypez&ocirc;k&ocirc;s</em>). &ldquo;These, taken together (each
triad being taken as a unit for the purpose), produce a total of nine
levels of being [...]. Here Syrianus is able to adduce five further
levels of divine entity below the &laquo;membrane&raquo;: (1)
hypercosmic gods; (2) hypercosmic-encosmic gods [...] (3) the encosmic
gods; (4) universal souls [...]; (5) the so-called &laquo;superior
classes of being&raquo; (<em>ta kreittona gen&ecirc;</em>), comprising
the angels, daemons and heroes (which Iamblichus had actually made the
subject of the third hypothesis, rather than Soul, as did all other
Neoplatonic exegetes&rdquo; (Dillon 2009: 237&ndash;8; additions in
square brackets are our own; on (3), (4) and (5), see Steel 2009; full
scheme in d&rsquo;Hoine-Martijn 2017: 323&ndash;8).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em><u>Henads.</u></em> Each set of attributes/level of reality/class
of gods manifests a decreasing unity (hence they are collectively
called &lsquo;the Unified&rsquo;, <em>to h&#275;nomenon</em>). This
brings us to the notorious doctrine of the henads, probably introduced
by Syrianus himself and later elaborated by Proclus (cf. <em>ET</em>
propp. &sect;&sect; 113&ndash;65, pp. 100&ndash;45 Dodds; <em>TP</em>
III 1&ndash;6 S.-W.; with Saffrey-Westerink 1978: XL&ndash;LXXVII,
part. XL&ndash;LII on the origin, which other interpreters, e.g.
Dillon 1972 and 1993, ascribe to Iamblichus; and D&rsquo;Ancona 1992):
&ldquo;the whole second hypothesis, therefore, [Syrianus] says,
reveals to us a multiplicity of autonomous henads, on which are
dependent the entities about which the second hypothesis teaches us,
revealing to us in its terms all their specific characteristics in
turn&rdquo; (<em>in Prm.</em> VI 1062.33&ndash;1063.1, p. 37 L.-S.).
The fundamental motivation for the henads lies therefore in &ldquo;die
crux neuplatonischer Philosophie&rdquo; (Beierwaltes 1980: 39): how
does the One, utterly simple, give rise to multiplicity? Aristotle
regarded the existence of multiplicity and difference as basic
evidence and dismissed the issue as based on false Eleatic premises
(cf. <em>Metaphysics</em> XIV 2.1089a1&ndash;2), but Syrianus insists
it is real (cf. 46.22&ndash;5 and Granieri 2024), and the henads are
meant to solve it: they are participated unities mediating between the
transcendent One and derivative beings.</p>

<p>
Even if the doctrine does not originate as such from Iamblichus
himself, the existence of the divine henads somehow follows from his
law of mean terms. This law states that &ldquo;every producing cause
brings into existence things like to itself before the unlike&rdquo;
(<em>ET</em> &sect; 28). Thus, there are no leaps in the chain of
being, but everything is linked together by similar terms. The henads
fulfill this function, for as participated unities they bridge the gap
between the transcendent One and everything that comes after it.
(Steel-Helmig 2020: &sect;3.1)</p>

<p>
Though not a separate hypostasis, henads are manifestations of the
first One at each hypostatic level, unifying it. Among the many
problems with this controversial doctrine is the relation of the
henads to the Monad-Dyad/Limit-Unlimited pair: the latter seems to
precede and ground the henads, yet the henads are described as
incomposite and functioning as an independent, parallel means of
explaining how multiplicity arises from the One. Various solutions
have been proposed. For example, some have argued that we should
distinguish different referents of &ldquo;henads&rdquo; depending on
the passages involved (cf. D&rsquo;Ancona 1992); others that at each
level of divine existence, the henads are a modality of Limit that
carries in itself a power to produce beings: Unlimitedness (van Riel
2001). Research on this topic is still ongoing and expanding (cf.
Opsomer <em>et al.</em> forthcoming).</p>

<h4>3.2.3 The One-Being (2): Forms</h4>

<p>
The third intelligible triad of Syrianus&rsquo; metaphysical hierarchy
includes the Paradigm, the realm of Platonic Forms. Syrianus&rsquo;
<em>Metaphysics</em> commentary, especially on Books XIII and XIV (and
more particularly on XIII.4&ndash;5, entitled in the
commentary&rsquo;s very manuscripts &ldquo;The argument about the
Forms&rdquo;), preserves many of his views on Forms. He takes these
views to constitute a body of doctrines shared also by the
Pythagoreans, Socrates and even the Eleatics (cf. e.g.
104.33&ndash;105.18), and immune from Aristotle&rsquo;s criticisms.
The commentary also supplies a useful scheme for ordering those views
under &ldquo;four problems&rdquo;: (1) whether Forms exist (which for
Syrianus is also to ask what and why they are); (2) of what things;
(3) what items participates in them; (4) how participation occurs
(108.31&ndash;109.4, commenting on <em>Metaph.</em> XIII
4.1079a3&ndash;4; cf. already 39.30&ndash;40.5, on
<em>Metaphysics</em> III 4.999b23&ndash;4). This scheme &ndash;
transmitted through Iamblichus from Middle Platonist scholastic
attempts at systematizing accounts of Forms, themselves shaped by
exegesis of the <em>Parmenides</em> and by engagement with
Aristotle&rsquo;s critiques of the Forms (cf. d&rsquo;Hoine 2004,
2009; Luna-Segonds 2011: 93&ndash;7) &ndash; was later adopted and
revised by Proclus in <em>in Prm.</em> III (cf. 784.14&ndash;27, p. 3
L.-S.; see also d&rsquo;Hoine-Michalewski 2012 for an overview of
Neoplatonist accounts of Forms roughly along the &ldquo;four
problems&rdquo; scheme).</p>

<p>
<em><u>The existence and nature of Forms.</u></em> Syrianus
distinguishes three main levels of being and Forms: intelligible,
dianoetic, and sensible (cf. esp. 81.31&ndash;83.31):</p>

<ol>

<li><em>Intelligible Forms</em> are universal, partless, perfect, and
simple essences, that exist eternally, immutably, and fully
exemplifying a given natural attribute. Thus, as Syrianus explains,
echoing Middle Platonist remarks, they are neither just names, nor
mental entities of sorts, as e.g. the Stoics believed (cf.
105.19&ndash;107.3 with D&ouml;rrie-Baltes 1998: 250&ndash;62). They
are not even mere eternal duplicates of sensible particulars, as
Aristotle contended, rejecting Platonic Forms as causally ineffective,
epistemologically useless and ultimately vacuous notions (cf. esp.
<em>On Ideas</em>; <em>Metaphysics</em> I 9, III 2, VII 14,
XIII&ndash;XIV). For Syrianus Aristotle&rsquo;s objections rest on a
physicalist misconception of Forms and their consequent reduction to
special sensibles (cf. Madigan 1986; Cardullo 2003; d&rsquo;Hoine
2023). Instead, Forms are the true causes of things, in three distinct
senses (cf. 82.2&ndash;11, 104.14&ndash;5, 107.38&ndash;108.7):
<em>efficient,</em> i.e. productive and generative;
<em>paradigmatic,</em> because their effects revert and assimilate to
them; and <em>final</em>, as sources of goodness, order, beauty, and
unity in their participants (due to their essentially mathematical
nature, which does not however make them identical to mathematical
numbers, on which cf. Mueller 1998; Dillon-O&rsquo;Meara 2006:
3&ndash;8; and Lernould 2009). By contrast, Aristotle&rsquo;s separate
incorporeal substances, the unmoved movers, are only final causes (or
at best also efficient, cf. Ge 2021). This causal description, too,
follows a Middle-Platonist scholastic classification of causes, later
developed by Proclus, and based on a revisionist expansion of
Aristotle&rsquo;s fourfold aetiological scheme (cf. d&rsquo;Hoine
2017). As immaterial, Intelligible Forms exist as &ldquo;both unified
and distinct, although embraced by a single nature&rdquo;
(85.12&ndash;4), and multilocated like light.</li>

<li><em>Dianoetic Forms</em> are images of the intelligible Forms
within the cosmic and individual soul (see &sect;3.2.4 below). They
are also the objects of recollection, not as concepts abstracted from
sensibles (so called &ldquo;later-born&rdquo; concepts), but
essentially pre-existing in our soul and implanted in it. Their
recollection is triggered by the experience of sensible Forms, which
stir up the soul. Dianoetic Forms have therefore a key epistemological
function for Syrianus (see &sect;4 below).</li>

<li><em>Sensible Forms</em> are images of dianoetic Forms and
contribute to the constitution of hylomorphic compounds. They are the
&ldquo;inseparable causes of sensible objects being the ultimate
images of the separate forms&rdquo;&nbsp;(83.5&ndash;6), and
contributing to the formation of sensible individuals. The latter are
also beings and substances in a certain way, but in a defective sense
<em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> true and eternal substances, and are better
called <em>genesis</em> (cf. 3.37&ndash;40, 171.32&ndash;3). Syrianus
thus does not wholly reject Aristotelian hylomorphic essentialism, but
subordinates it to the Platonist doctrine of intelligible
Forms-causes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<em><u>The extent of the realm of Forms.</u></em> Although they are
universal (though not causally inert, as per various standard modern
theories of universals), and although it is true that &ldquo;if there
is a Form of a given thing, there will also be universal
reason-principles of that thing&rdquo; (114.11), it is not the case
that for every concept over many particulars there is a Form
corresponding to it (cf. 114.9&ndash;11). Thus, <em>pace</em>
Aristotle, Syrianus denies (that Plato countenanced) Forms of: evils;
negations; changeable things; bare parts, i.e. parts which are not
also wholes (e.g. hands or fingers); primary attributes of bodies
(e.g. sweetness or whiteness); composite entities (e.g. white man);
artifacts (cf. d&rsquo;Hoine 2006a and 2006b); things contrary to
nature (cf. 107.5&ndash;108.29, 110.18&ndash;27, 114.2&ndash;11 with
D&ouml;rrie-Baltes 1998: 343&ndash;53). In short, he admits only Forms
of natural kinds (and we would like to know more about what criteria
of &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; he advocated).</p>

<p>
<em><u>Participation and &lsquo;Third-Man&rsquo; argument.</u></em>
The complementary relation to eidetic causality is participation
(<em>methexis</em>): that on which a Form exerts its causal action,
bestowing to it certain properties, is said to <em>participate</em> in
that Form. Like several predecessors, Syrianus asks what items count
as participants (cf. D&ouml;rrie-Baltes 1998: 359&ndash;67), and
answers, following Iamblichus, that they are neither <em>all</em>
intelligibles and <em>all</em> sensibles (<em>pace</em> Numenius,
Cronius, and Amelius), nor <em>only</em> sensibles (<em>pace</em>
Porphyry), nor <em>only</em> intelligibles: they are Soul and the
sensibles (109.14&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
Focusing with Aristotle on the Forms-sensibles relation, Syrianus
holds, consistently with various Platonic dialogues (cf. e.g.
<em>Phaedo</em> 78e2; <em>Parmenides</em> 133d3; <em>Timaeus</em>
52a5), that by participating in a Form, a sensible participant also
takes its name, and also that &lsquo;Forms are indeed homonymous with
sensible particulars, and not synonymous with them&rsquo;
(108.27&ndash;9; echoed by 111.37&ndash;8). Yet, they are not
&ldquo;homonymous in any chance sense, but only in the way that a
model is related to an image of itself, and specifically when the
model generates the images in virtue of its essence, and causes them
to revert to it&rdquo; (115.1&ndash;3). The point is that Forms and
sensibles do not share the same essence and are not what they are in
an identical sense: the Form of F-ness is F in a sense fundamentally
different from the many Fs (the Form of Man is man in a sense
fundamentally different from the many men). The former is the
paradigmatic essence of F, the latter possesses F-ness only in a
derivative and defective way.</p>

<p>
This also allows for a solution to the notorious Third-Man Argument
(cf. esp. Opsomer 2004), evoked by Aristotle at <em>Metaphysics</em>
XIII 4.1079a11&ndash;13 as a well-known problem for proponents of
Forms, and raised already by Plato at <em>Parmenides</em>
132a&ndash;133a: if the Form of Man not only fully expresses the
characteristic of &ldquo;what-it-is-to-be-a-man&rdquo; (say
&ldquo;humanity&rdquo;) but also is a perfect instance of that
characteristic (i.e.&nbsp;the &ldquo;Form-of-Man&rdquo; is a man, more
perfect than any physical man), then there must be a resemblance
between the Form of Man and the physical copy of that form, which
requires the postulation of a &ldquo;Third Man&rdquo; grounding such
resemblance. Syrianus points out correctly (cf. 111.27&ndash;33) that
this kind of argument could go on <em>ad infinitum</em> and then
retorts (cf. 111.33&ndash;112.6) that it is a mistake to suppose that
the predicate &ldquo;man&rdquo; is used in the same sense in the two
cases: &ldquo;If the point is that, because the Essential Man is
synonymous with men in this realm, as Alexander states in his exegesis
of this passage, and all synonyms come to be synonyms by virtue in
their participation in some Form, a &rdquo;third man&ldquo; will
manifest itself as being predicated of both the Form and the things in
this realm, then the argument becomes ridiculous; for it is not the
case that the things in this realm are synonymous with the relevant
Form&rdquo; (111.33&ndash;37). Syrianus does not deny
self-predication, but contends instead that the predication of
&ldquo;man&rdquo; in the case of the Form and in the case of the
natural human being, involves homonymy, though, as already mentioned,
in the way proper to a model-copy relation (cf. again 115.1&ndash;3).
That is to say, the Form of Man is a man in the sense that it is
productive of natural substances of a specific kind, i.e.&nbsp;human
beings, which deserve the same predicate to the extent that they
actively instantiate the essential characteristic of that form
(i.e.&nbsp;&ldquo;revert to it&rdquo;). In the end, Syrianus&rsquo;
solution to the problem may not be entirely satisfactory, but it was,
by his time, the standard one among Platonists.</p>

<h4>3.2.4 Soul</h4>

<p>
The third hypothesis of the <em>Parmenides</em>, Syrianus maintains,
deals with the Soul. But not &ldquo;all Soul pure and simple, but such
as has proceeded forth after the divine Soul; for the whole divine
Soul is comprised in the second hypothesis&rdquo; (Proclus, <em>in
Prm.</em> VI 1063.5&ndash;7, p. 38 L.-S. &lt; Syrianus, <em>in
Prm.</em> fr. 3 KW). Syrianus distinguishes three types of souls: (1)
divine; (2) intermediate or demonic, always engaged in intellectual
activity; and (3) human, which exercise it in inconstant and
changeable ways (cf. Proclus, <em>ET</em> &sect;184, p.160.21&ndash;30
Dodds). Souls of the first type are described in the second
hypothesis, where Plato says that the One partakes of time (cf.
<em>Prm.</em> 151e3&ndash;153b7), a condition proper to souls (cf.
Steel 2009); whereas demonic and human souls, derived from divine
ones, are described in the third. This arrangement &ndash; whose
philosophical motivation is likely to assign distinct life principles
to different levels of the hierarchy &ndash; sets Syrianus&rsquo;
exegesis apart from those of various predecessors, such as Plutarch of
Athens, who assigned the third hypothesis to soul without distinction,
and Porphyry, who, while making distinctions, assigned it to the whole
soul, rather than to the rational alone, as Amelius claimed (cf.
Luna-Segonds 2017: 242&ndash;3). The Athenian tendency to multiply the
levels of reality to meet both exegetical and philosophical needs is
again evident.</p>

<p>
Further insights into Syrianus&rsquo;&nbsp;view of the soul come from
fragments of his <em>Timaeus</em> commentary (also collected and
examined by Klitenic Wear 2011; cf. also her 2009). These suggest a
complex view of the soul, building on various Neoplatonist
predecessors, notably Porphyry and Iamblichus. Syrianus regards the
soul as a life-giving principle, operating across different levels of
reality. Central to his doctrine is the relationship between the
hypostasis Soul (the transcendent universal Soul) and the individual
soul. Regarding the former, Syrianus seems to conflate it with the
World Soul, arguing that it possesses both a transcendent,
super-cosmic aspect linked to Intellect (after Iamblichus) and a
multiplicity of powers suitably distributed throughout the cosmos
(echoing Porphyry), without thereby having a precise spatial location
(agreeing with both Porphyry and Iamblichus) (cf. esp. Proclus, <em>in
Ti.</em> II 105.28&ndash;106.9 Diehl, III 147.3&ndash;15 van Riel =
Syrianus, <em>in Ti.</em> fr. 13 KW). The soul is thus one by virtue
of this super-cosmic element and multiple by virtue of its division.
As both one and many, the soul can proceed and revert while remaining
in itself, exercising unified providence over the all plurality of
pure forms and particular bodies. Regarding individual souls,
Syrianus, like Iamblichus, stressed their cyclical descent into
generation. This descent is a necessary process (as the soul&rsquo;s
nature precludes permanent residence in the intelligible realm) with
variations in frequency leading to differing degrees of connection to
higher realities (cf. Proclus, <em>in Ti.</em> III 236.31&ndash;237.9,
278.9&ndash;32 Diehl, V 97.22&ndash;98.6, 151.11&ndash;152.9 van Riel
= Syrianus, <em>in Ti.</em> ffr. 23 and 25 KW). Overall,
Syrianus&rsquo;&nbsp;doctrine highlights the soul&rsquo;s unity and
multiplicity and its role in connecting higher and lower principles,
contributing to a highly interconnected universe, a concept further
developed by Proclus (Klitenic Wear 2009: 200).</p>

<p>
Another relevant source for the interpretation of Syrianus&rsquo;
views on the soul is Hermias&rsquo; commentary on the
<em>Phaedrus</em>, the only Neoplatonist commentary on this dialogue
and the only writing of Hermias that survives (of which we now have a
new critical edition, Lucarini-Moreschini 2012; a full English
translation, Baltzly-Share 2018 and 2023; a book-length study, Neola
2022; and a full collection of papers, Finamore-Manolea-Klitenic Wear
2019). Traditionally, this work has been considered a faithful record
of Syrianus&rsquo; teaching, with Hermias&rsquo; contribution deemed
minimal (cf. <em>i.a.</em> Menn 2012: 45 n.3; Luna 2016: 689&ndash;91,
with further references) - also due to Damascius&rsquo; judgement of
Hermias as a zealous and hard-working scholar but unoriginal
philosopher (cf. Damascius, <em>Life of Isidore</em>, fr. 54, pp.
152&ndash;4 A.). However, this view has faced significant recent
scholarly criticism (cf. esp. Fortier 2018 and Neola 2022, but already
Moreschini 1992, 2009). This fundamental scholarly disagreement may be
a consequence of the intractability of the authorship question based
on the available evidence, or so do the most recent translators of
Hermias commentary believe (Baltzly-Share 2018: &sect;5). Due to this
complicated state of affairs and the present space limitations of this
entry, we will leave Hermias&rsquo; commentary aside.</p>

<h3 id="PriDem">3.3 Principles of demonstration</h3>

<p>
Syrianus agrees with Aristotle that first philosophy studies also the
principles of demonstration, i.e. the syllogistic axioms, first and
foremost those we traditionally call the Principle of
Non-Contradiction (PNC) and the Principle of Excluded Middle (PEM).
While his <em>Metaphysics</em> commentary offers limited remarks on
the PEM, his insights on the PNC are significant (they have been
extensively examined by Longo 2004, 2005, 2009; cf. also O&rsquo;Meara
2009 and Kiosoglou forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Three key aspects of Syrianus&rsquo; treatment of the PNC stand
out:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li><u>Pre-Aristotelian Formulations</u>: Syrianus contends that the
PNC was formulated already by philosophers prior to Aristotle (cf.
18.18). Likely he has in mind figures such as Parmenides, the
Pythagoreans, and Plato (cf. Longo 2004; on Plato, cf.
<em>Republic</em> IV 436b9&ndash;10; <em>Euthydemus</em>
293c8&ndash;d1; <em>Phaedo</em> 102e8&ndash;103b5; <em>Theaetetus</em>
188a10&ndash;b1; <em>Sophist</em> 230b7&ndash;8). He therefore
questions the originality of Aristotle&rsquo;s formulation of the
PNC.</li>

<li><u>Exclusion of the One-Good</u>: Syrianus explicitly excludes the
One-Good, the highest principle in his metaphysical hierarchy, from
the scope of the PNC (cf. 18.22&ndash;9; Kiosoglou forthcoming sees in
this passage a polemic against Origen). He bases this on the authority
of older philosophers (Pythagoreans and Plato) and his own strong
interpretation of <em>Republic</em> VI 509b, which places the One-Good
<em>beyond</em> being (cf. &sect;3.2.1). Since the PNC, following
Aristotle, applies to every being <em>qua</em> being, this exclusion
is consistent.</li>

<li><u>Plurality of PNC?</u>: Uniquely in ancient philosophy, Syrianus
refers to axiom<em>s</em> of contradiction (in the plural) on three
occasions (cf. 71.13&ndash;15; 78.22&ndash;5; 79.15&ndash;17; for the
expression in the singular, cf. 66.14, 68.29, 69.7&ndash;8,
74.17&ndash;8). According to Longo (esp. 2005), this should be
explained in the broader context of Syrianus&rsquo; distinction
between two versions of the PNC: one positing that two contradictory
statements cannot both be <em>true</em>, and another that they cannot
both be <em>false</em>. This distinction &ndash; so her reading goes
&ndash; bears also interesting resemblance to the modern analysis of
one of the most eminent modern interpreters of the Aristotelian PNC
theory, Jan &#321;ukasiewicz (cf. Longo 2009). To this interpretation,
however, it has been objected (cf. Cavini 2007: 151&ndash;4) that
Syrianus refers to the principle of excluded middle (PEM),
particularly in its syntactic variant, as &ldquo;the other of the
axioms of contradiction&rdquo; (71.14&ndash;5), and therefore that he
does not in fact distinguish between <em>two versions</em> of the PNC,
but collectively calls the PNC and PEM &ldquo;axioms of
contradiction&rdquo; (a plural expression that can be explained in
light of the use, common among commentators, of the expression
&lsquo;axiom of contradiction&rsquo; both collectively, to indicate
both the PNC and PEM, and distributively, to indicate the PNC alone;
cf. also Kiosoglou forthcoming for further discussion).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Epi">4. Epistemology</h2>

<p>
The cornerstone of Syrianus&rsquo; theory of science is a point on
which he actually agrees with Aristotle: science is of universals (cf.
e.g. 161.4&ndash;5, 163.1&ndash;2; Aristotle, <em>Metaphysics</em> III
6.1003a14&ndash;5; <em>On the Soul</em> II 5.417b22&ndash;3; also
<em>Posterior Analytics</em> I 11.77a7&ndash;8; <em>Topics</em> VII
14.164a10&ndash;1; on Syrianus&rsquo; and Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of
science in the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> cf. Ierodiakonou 2009 and
Longo 2011). But he has a different conception of universals, which
substantially differentiates his epistemology from Aristotle&rsquo;s.
In addition to Platonic intelligible Forms, the first paradigmatic
universals (cf. &sect;3.2.3), Syrianus distinguishes three further
types of universals (two of which correspond to two types of essences
and Forms distinguished above, cf. &sect;3.2.3): dianoetic, i.e.
located in the cosmic and individual soul; immanent, i.e. located in
cosmic nature; and &lsquo;later-born&rsquo;
(<em>hysterogen&#275;</em>), abstracted from sensible particulars (cf.
e.g. 28.11&ndash;3, 53.8&ndash;9, 160.30&ndash;161.36).
Syrianus&rsquo; position is that the proper objects of science are the
dianoetic universals or Forms. These are images of the intelligible
Forms within the cosmic and individual soul, where they are implanted
and pre-exist eternally. By contrast, Platonic intelligible Forms are
beyond the human capacity for comprehension and discourse, so strictly
speaking they cannot be scientifically known (cf. 115.21&ndash;6, also
citing Aristotle, <em>Metaph.</em> VIII 3.1043b25&ndash;32). Immanent
universals are multiplied in their instances, thus lacking the unity
required by the object of science. The &ldquo;later-born&rdquo;
universals are logical entities, whereas science must grasp the actual
articulations of reality. To better understand Syrianus&rsquo;
position, we can analyze a specific passage, 160.30&ndash;161.36.</p>

<p>
At <em>Metaphysics</em> XIII 9.1086b5&ndash;7, Aristotle contends
that, while it is true that &ldquo;without the universal it is not
possible to get knowledge&rdquo;, it is not the case that universals
are separable (as, according to Aristotle, Plato and his followers
believe). Commenting on these lines, Syrianus undertakes to show that,
<em>pace</em> Aristotle, the universals from which demonstrative
proofs and scientific knowledge derive cannot be inseparable
universals (i.e.&nbsp;inseparable from the particulars, or enmattered
universals), but must be &ldquo;causal principles which are both prior
and more general [than sensible things]&rdquo; (161.24). His first
argument proceeds counterfactually: &ldquo;if demonstrations are
arrived at by means of inseparable universals, first of all,
&rdquo;animal&ldquo; will not be said of human being as a whole; for
the animal in human being will not, presumably, embrace also
&rdquo;rational&ldquo;, &rdquo;capable of laughter&ldquo;, and
&rdquo;mortal&ldquo;&rdquo; (161.16&ndash;18). That is: suppose
demonstrations are obtained through inseparable universals; then, in
the conclusion &ldquo;human being is a rational animal&rdquo;, the
genus &ldquo;animal&rdquo; designates an inseparable universal, i.e.
the instantiated genus (&ldquo;the animal in human being&rdquo;); if
so, however, &lsquo;animal&rsquo; could not be predicated of
&lsquo;human being&rsquo; as a whole, because it is only a part of it
(the two constitutive parts of a species being genus and differentia)
and cannot therefore itself embrace the constitutive differentiae of
that species (e.g. &ldquo;rational&rdquo;, &ldquo;capable of
laughter&rdquo;, and &ldquo;mortal&rdquo;). Only the separate
universal or genus can contain the differentiae and produce scientific
knowledge.</p>

<p>
Dianoetic universals are thus the true objects of recollection. They
are not empirically acquired concepts abstracted from sensible
particulars, but essentially pre-existing notions implanted in our
souls. Immanent universals are not themselves the objects of science,
but the experience of them stirs up the soul and triggers the
recollection of dianoetic Forms. Thus, Syrianus is a pugnacious critic
of the abstractionism he attributes to Aristotle and a defender of
Platonic innatism and theory of recollection. In this too he will be
followed by Proclus (cf. Mueller 1990; Helmig 2012: 205&ndash;335;
Lautner 2024; cf. also Lautner 2009 for the distinction of different
types of <em>logos</em> in Syrianus&rsquo; theory of science).</p>

<h2 id="PhiNat">5. Philosophy of nature</h2>

<p>
Like all ancient Platonists, Syrianus thinks that the sensible objects
we ordinarily experience are ontologically defective. They are
imperfect, impermanent, unstable, and constitutively subject to
generation and corruption. The physical cosmos, following the
<em>Timaeus</em>, does not constitute a self-sufficient order, but
depends entirely on higher, incorporeal causes. Bodies are passive,
devoid of intrinsic power, and wholly subject to action from
incorporeal agent-principles, of which they are no more than an
illusory projection. The production, organization and functioning of
empirical phenomena is the result of the work of the only true causes,
the supersensible ones. In particular, they are the result of the
action of an intelligent agent, the demiurge (cf. Klitenic Wear 2017),
who in the Syrianean-Proclean pantheon represents the third member of
the first intellectual triad (cf. above &sect;3.2.2.; Klitenic Wear
2011: 12&ndash;5). Supersensible causes pervade the cosmos and keep it
operating according to a precise plan. Physical
properties&mdash;extension, motion, resistance&mdash;are pale
reflections of ideal paradigms. Thus, the sensible world possesses
only a diminished, derivative mode of being. Strictly speaking one can
only improperly apply to it the name &ldquo;substance&rdquo;
(<em>ousia</em>&mdash;&lsquo;becoming&rsquo; (<em>genesis</em>) is the
more appropriate name (cf. 3.37&ndash;40 and 171.32&ndash;3). Here,
however, also lies the ambivalence of the relationship of Platonists
like Syrianus with the physical world. It is itself flawed and
imperfect, but as the effect of paradigmatic causes and ultimately of
the One-Good principle it is ordered according to a good and positive
design.</p>

<p>
Syrianus agrees with Aristotle that sensible beings are composed of
form and matter. However, he also stresses that enmattered forms are
mere images of and depend upon separate intelligible Forms, the true
<em>ousiai</em>, hence on still higher metaphysical principles, up to
the One-Good. Thus, he accepts some of the basic claims of
Aristotelian hylomorphism, but frames them in a distinctively
Platonist theory of transcendent and paradigmatic causes. This
differentiates Syrianus&rsquo; position from that of other
Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus, who firmly reject Aristotelian
hylomorphism and essentialism.</p>

<p>
The chief cause of the inferiority of sensible beings is their
material component. This does not imply the identification of matter
and evil. Syrianus sees evil as a necessity of the universe and part
of a providential plan. Indeed, what appears evil to us is only so
from our limited perspective, that is, because we consider the whole
from the point of view of the part. That is, we lack the global
perspective of the divine creator. Evil does not exist in an absolute
sense, as evil <em>per se</em>, because the Demiurge has produced the
totality of the world according to a providential good plan. The only
possible existence of evil is parasitic, as indicated by Iamblichus
and reiterated by Proclus: evil exists only in connection with matter,
without however being the same as&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>
Syrianus also articulates a complex metaphysical account of time and
space grounded in a hierarchical and participatory cosmology. He
conceives of time not as a mere measure of motion, but as a distinct
metaphysical reality (though still a mere <em>image</em> of eternity)
rooted in the psychic realm, where it governs the soul&rsquo;s
cyclical movements and imitates higher eternal patterns. Eternity, by
contrast, is situated in the intelligible realm and identified with
the unified, unchanging totality of being. Time proceeds from this
eternal source, unfolding its content in a discursive manner suitable
to soul&rsquo;s nature (cf. Klitenic Wear 2008). Similarly, Syrianus
redefines space&mdash;or place&mdash;as an incorporeal interval
(<em>diast&#275;ma</em>) that functions not as a passive container,
but as a dynamic mediating principle between the World Soul and the
physical cosmos. Informed by intelligible forms and psychic
<em>logoi</em>, place actively orders and sustains the natural motion
of bodies, assigning them to their proper regions (cf. Marongiu 2024).
Thus, Syrianus integrates temporal and spatial realities within a
metaphysical framework that preserves the primacy of intelligible
causality while accounting for the ordered structure of the physical
world.</p>
