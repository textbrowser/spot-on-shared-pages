<p>
Maria Montessori (1870&ndash;1952) was one of the most influential
pedagogues of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
developing an educational method that currently guides over 15,000
schools in dozens of countries. Montessori was never merely a teacher,
however. She was a psychologist, anthropologist, doctor, cultural
critic, and philosopher. Her writings span a wide range of
philosophical issues, from metaphysics to political philosophy, but
she always discusses philosophical issues in ways that make use of
insights&mdash;what she calls revelations&mdash;gleaned from her work
with children. In recent years, philosophers have begun to attend to
her work. After a short overview of her life and most philosophically
important works, this entry discusses Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy of
education, metaphysics, epistemology, moral philosophy, and political
theory.</p>

<h2 id="LifMajWor">1. Life and Major Works</h2>

<h3 id="MonLif">1.1 Montessori&rsquo;s Life</h3>

<p>
Maria Montessori was born in Chiaravalle, Ancona, Italy, on August 31,
1870 and died in Noordwijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, on May 6, 1952.
Over the course of her life, she spent prolonged periods in many
countries running training courses for teachers who sought to
implement her pedagogical philosophy, and she lived for extended
periods in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and India. Like William
James or Sigmund Freud, she did not begin her career as a professional
philosopher. Instead, she studied technical engineering in her
secondary school and then enrolled at the University of Rome (La
Sapienza) in 1890, where after two years of study in the natural
sciences and then supplementary exams in Latin and Italian, she was
admitted as a third-year medical student, becoming one of the first
women in Italy to attend medical school (see Matellicani 2007 for
detailed discussion of her years at the University of Rome). According
to one biographer, early in her life she wanted to be &ldquo;anything
but a teacher&rdquo; (Standing 1957: 23), and she always identified
more as a scientist of human nature than as a teacher per se. During
the year that she graduated from medical school (1896), Montessori
also represented Italy at the International Women&rsquo;s Congress in
Berlin, evidence of her important role in feminist and progressive
political circles.</p>

<p>
After graduating from medical school, Montessori established a medical
practice and was appointed as a co-director of a new
&ldquo;Orthophrenic School&rdquo;, which treated children with a range
of disadvantages, from poverty to what we would now call intellectual
disability to severe mental illness. In that context, Montessori
argued&mdash;against biological theories such as those of Cesare
Lombroso&mdash;that the problems faced by these children are
&ldquo;more&hellip;educational than medical&rdquo; (MS
 2:21,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 cf. 1903). She was interested in the psychological and pedagogical
work of &Eacute;douard S&eacute;guin and Jean-Gaspard Itard and in
1899, in conjunction with her work at the Orthophrenic school, she
traveled to Paris to study their work.</p>

<p>
In 1903, Montessori returned to the University of Rome, being admitted
as a third-year graduate student in philosophy, despite not having the
classical diploma that was technically a prerequisite for admission
(De Stefano 2020 [2022, 73]). As she explained, &ldquo;wishing to
undertake the study of
 normal<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 pedagogy and of the principles upon which it is based, I registered
as a student of philosophy at the University&rdquo; (2:23; 1909 [1912:
33]). While there, she took courses in the history of philosophy,
ethics, metaphysics, and the philosophy of education with philosophers
such as Antonio Labriola and Luigi Credaro, though she was also drawn
to both pragmatist and positivist currents that were influential at
the time (see Matellicani 2007; James 1906; Santucci 1963). One
contemporary reported that during this period,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
she saw the &ldquo;two camps&rdquo; very plainly&mdash;the professors
of the humanities sneering at science; and the scientists laughing at
the philosophers, and she thought to herself that some day the teacher
would come who would unite these two opposed interpretations of life
into one. (Radice 1920: 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
During this period, Montessori herself held teaching positions, first
as a Chair of &ldquo;Hygiene and Anthropology&rdquo; at the Women&rsquo;s
Magisterial Institute in Rome (a position she held from
1899&ndash;1917) and then, after 1904, as an instructor of
anthropology in the Faculties of Medicine and of Physical,
Mathematical and Natural Sciences. Her 1910 <em>Antropologia
Pedagogica [Pedagogical Anthropology]</em>, based on these courses,
arguably begins to bridge the gap she had identified between
scientific method and philosophical insight into the human
 condition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 During this period, Montessori also continued writing and speaking on
empirical scientific work and was involved with various progressive
causes, including a student group called Pensiero e Azione (Thought
and Action), which, among other things, advocated for women&rsquo;s
suffrage.</p>

<p>
The pivotal event in Montessori&rsquo;s life was an invitation by
Edoardo Talamo, a developer of a progressive real estate association
renovating tenement housing in the slum district of San Lorenzo in
Rome. Talamo wanted to provide childcare and education to residents of
his new buildings and invited Montessori to oversee the endeavor.
Montessori used this opportunity to create a model classroom in which
she could study the effects of various educational materials and
pedagogical methods on ordinary children. This provided the foundation
for what Patrick Frierson has called a &ldquo;pedagogical
naturalism&rdquo;, a project of cultivating materials and prepared
environments within which children could flourish in freedom and
thereby disclose fundamental truths about human nature, development,
and culture (Frierson forthcoming). In 1909, Montessori described the
results of her initial work in the &ldquo;Casa dei Bambini&rdquo;
(Children&rsquo;s House) in a work entitled <em>Il Metodo della
Pedagogia Scientifica applicato all&rsquo;educazione infantile nelle
Case dei Bambini</em> [<em>The Method of Scientific Pedagogy Applied
to Children&rsquo;s Education in the Children&rsquo;s Houses</em>],
which was translated into English in 1912 as <em>The Montessori
Method</em>, and which went through a series of substantive revisions
over the next forty years (see Trabalzini 2003, 2011, 2023). This
initial experiment garnered Montessori international attention and
enabled (indeed, required) a shift away from her medical practice
towards a full time focus on developing, teaching, and spreading her
pedagogical methods. Over the rest of her life, she gave over fifty
teacher training courses in several countries, including Italy,
England, Spain, the United States, and India. Throughout her life, she
continued to weigh in on topics of public importance, though her
emphasis increasingly shifted from feminist and broadly progressive
political concerns to a focus on children&rsquo;s right and the role
of children in the rehabilitation of society and the future of
humankind.</p>

<p>
A full discussion of Montessori&rsquo;s life would go beyond what is
necessary or appropriate here; instead, see Kramer 1976 or Moretti
2021. Even a brief discussion of her life cannot leave out, however,
one of its more controversial episodes, namely Montessori&rsquo;s
willingness to work with Benito Mussolini during the period of Italian
fascism. As Mussolini rose to power in Italy in the late 1920s and
1930s, Montessori was an international sensation living and working in
Barcelona, Spain. Starting with its inclusion in Giovanni
Gentile&rsquo;s school reforms in 1923, Montessori&rsquo;s education
method was included in discussions of reforming education in Italy,
and in the early years of his reign, Mussolini offered &ldquo;official
recognition and extensive establishment of Montessori schools&rdquo;
throughout Italy (Moretti 2023: 292). Montessori reciprocated by
inviting him to be, for example, President of the Opera Nazionale
Montessori and offering that, as Quarfood puts it, &ldquo;her
character-building method is entirely in line with the regime&rsquo;s
intentions to improve the population&rsquo;s morale&rdquo; (Quarfood
2022: 176). By 1936, however, Montessori and Mussolini severed their
relationship, as Mussolini went to war in East Africa, the Nazis shut
down all Montessori schools in Germany, and Montessori and her
colleagues were being surveilled by the fascists for anti-fascist
activity. The Opera Nazionale Montessori was shut down and Montessori
education not supported (though not officially banned) in Italy.
Scholars disagree about how best to assess the relationship between
Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy and that of the fascist regime in Italy.
Some have claimed that Montessori&rsquo;s pedagogy was &ldquo;well
equipped to serve the fascist regime of Mussolini&rdquo; (Engelmann
2022: 527; see too Leenders 2001). The more common reading is that the
relationship was marriage of convenience, in which at first each
&ldquo;heard what [they] wanted to hear&rdquo; (Kramer 1976: 282, see
too 302&ndash;3), but eventually &ldquo;the fundamental differences
between the principles of Montessori&rsquo;s work and&hellip;the
fascist regime brought the relationship to a predictable halt&rdquo;
(Moretti 2023: 293). Christine Quarfood offers an overview of debates
about Montessori&rsquo;s fascism (Quarfood 2022: 129&ndash;167),
including intermediate views such as Luisa Lama&rsquo;s suggestion
that &ldquo;fascism&rsquo;s attention to the problems of childhood may
have deceived Montessori&rdquo; (Lama 2002: 325, quoted and translated
in Quarfood 2022: 184; see too Marazzi 2000). Quarfood herself
highlights certain features of fascism that Montessori would have
found congenial, such as Mussolini&rsquo;s suggestion that
&ldquo;ignorant parents&rdquo; are the &ldquo;&lsquo;main
obstacle&rsquo; to the regime&rsquo;s eugenics program&rdquo; or that
the right kind of education could enhance the human race and promote
&ldquo;the moral and physical health of the lineage&rdquo; (see
Quarfood 2022: 203, 208). Nonetheless, Montessori&rsquo;s commitments
to peace, cosmopolitanism, and especially to expanding liberty for
children and ultimately for all people put her fundamentally at odds
with fascist ideology. At a time when illiteracy was still a serious
problem in Italy, Montessori and the fascists shared an interest in
the role of education in human progress, but fundamental differences
led them to take this shared interest in very different directions in
the end.</p>

<h3 id="MonWor">1.2 Montessori&rsquo;s Works</h3>

<p>
Over the course of her life, in addition to extensive lecture courses
(for many of which we have transcripts) and concrete pedagogical
materials, Maria Montessori wrote nearly two dozen books and hundreds
of essays and articles. During her early years as a student and
shortly thereafter, she actively wrote scientific articles and papers
such as &ldquo;Sul significato dei cristalli del Leyden
nell&rsquo;asma bronchiale&rdquo; (&ldquo;On the significance of
Leyden crystals in bronchial asthma&rdquo;; Montessori 1896),
&ldquo;Sulle cosidette allucinazioni antagonistiche&rdquo; (&ldquo;On
supposed antagonistic hallucinations&rdquo;; Montessori &amp; De
Sanctis 1897) or &ldquo;La teoria lombrosiana e l&rsquo;educazione
morale&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Lombrosian theory and moral
education&rdquo;; Montessori 1903). Throughout her life, too, she
wrote short articles on various topics ranging from specific
pedagogical practices to broader cultural critique.</p>

<p>
By far Montessori&rsquo;s most important work during her lifetime was
<em>Il Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica applicato
all&rsquo;educazione infantile nelle Case dei Bambini</em> (1909),
first translated into English as <em>The Montessori Method</em> (1912)
and then later translated (based on a new edition) as <em>The
Discovery of the Child</em>. In this work, she describes the
philosophy and specific pedagogical practices underlying her initial
experiment at the Casa dei Bambini in the San Lorenzo district of
Rome. The work underwent substantive revisions over the course of five
major distinct editions.</p>

<p>
For studying Montessori&rsquo;s philosophical ideas, several other
books are particularly valuable. Her second book, <em>Antropologia
Pedagogica</em> (1910), translated as <em>Pedagogical
Anthropology</em> (1912), is based on her lectures at the University
of Rome. This book situates Montessori&rsquo;s method in the context
of trends of Italian anthropology in the early twentieth century, and
it includes her discussions (including critiques) of figures such as
Darwin, Lombroso, and her mentor Guiseppe Sergi.
<em>L&rsquo;autoeducazione nelle Scuole Elementari</em> (published in
Italian in 1916 and variously translated as <em>Spontaneous Activity
in Education</em> or as <em>The Advanced Montessori Method</em>)
includes extensive discussions not only of her method but also of her
epistemology (especially in chapters on &ldquo;Imagination&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Intelligence&rdquo;), philosophy of mind, conceptions of agency
and moral philosophy (especially in the chapter on
&ldquo;Will&rdquo;), and philosophy of religion. Perhaps her most
popular book today, and one that gives an excellent introduction to
her philosophy, is <em>The Absorbent Mind</em>, a book originally
published in English in 1949 based on her lectures in India, but
substantially revised by Montessori and republished as <em>La mente
del bambino: Mente assorbente</em> in 1952. This book focuses on
education and development for children during the first six, and
especially first three, years of life. Beyond specific claims about
child development, it provides some of Montessori&rsquo;s most
polished articulations of the role of embodied movement in cognition,
the nature of volition and character, the importance of social
solidarity in political organization, and the role of love in human
life.</p>

<p>
In addition to published books, many of Montessori&rsquo;s smaller
speeches and articles are important for understanding her philosophy.
Some of these lectures have been collected and published in their
entirety; her <em>1913 Rome Lectures</em> (MS 28) and <em>1946 London
Lectures</em> (MS 27) are particularly valuable not only for the
explicit discussion of philosophical themes such as freedom, morality,
and the nature of the world, but also because they span virtually her
entire career, making it easy to see development in her ideas.
Articles such as &ldquo;Norme per una classificazione dei deficienti
in rapporto ai metodi speciali di educazione&rdquo; (Montessori 1902)
or &ldquo;La teoria lombrosiana e l&rsquo;educazione morale&rdquo;
(Montessori 1903) help situate her philosophical ideas in the context
of intellectual developments in early twentieth-century Italy.
&ldquo;The Unconscious in History&rdquo; (Montessori 1948 [1973]) and
&ldquo;Cosmic Education Lectures&rdquo; (Montessori 1935&ndash;6
[2007&ndash;9]) provide crucial insights into her metaphysics. Among
the most important set of writings are those collected in the volume
<em>Education and Peace</em> (MS 10). These discuss her vision of
peace and the role of education in fostering peace (see Moretti 2021,
and
 <a href="#PeaEduRigChi">&sect;7</a>
 below) and also provide insight into her political philosophy more
broadly and her insightful philosophy of technology.</p>

<p>
Others of Montessori&rsquo;s books have important contributions to
make to understanding her philosophy. <em>The Secret of Childhood</em>
(MS 22), for example, discusses the nature of children&rsquo;s and
adults&rsquo; work, the role of guiding instincts, and various psychic
deviations and repressions that arise from repression of those
instincts. <em>Psychogeometry</em> and <em>Psychoarithmetic</em> (MS
16 &amp; 20) give insight not only into Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy
of mathematics but her cognitive theory more broadly. Her works on art
and music (especially MS 2: 299&ndash;314; MS 13: 283&ndash;354; MS
23: passim) elucidate the role of beauty and art in human life. And
she has several works&mdash;including <em>The Child in the Church</em>
(Montessori 1929 [1965]), <em>The Mass Explained to Children</em> (MS
19), and the lectures collected as <em>Montessori. Dio e il bambino e
altri scritti</em> (De Giorgi 2013)&mdash;that are important for
understanding her theology and philosophy of religion.</p>

<p>
Notably, none of these works are devoted exclusively to topics one
might consider &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; in the narrow sense, and
with the exception of William James (e.g., 9:116&ndash;7, 158) and
some smatterings of Freud (1:75n, 22:4&ndash;7, 59, 81), Bergson
(1:75n), or Nietzsche (9:257&ndash;8; 1909 [1912: 68]), there is
relatively little direct engagement with figures considered central to
customary canons within philosophy. Reading Montessori&rsquo;s works
as a philosopher&mdash;like reading the works of Freud or Darwin or
even Nietzsche&mdash;thus often requires willingness to attend to the
philosophical claims that Montessori advances while she is
articulating her vision of human life for other, especially
pedagogical or cultural-critical, purposes. Still, as this entry will
show, her philosophical insights are important, far-reaching, and
well-articulated once one knows where and how to look for them.</p>

<h2 id="PhiEdu">2. Philosophy of Education</h2>

<p>
Andrew Colgan has rightly noted &ldquo;an unfortunate absence of
Montessorian thought in our modern education and philosophy of
education literature&rdquo; (Colgan 2016: 137), and others have
remarked that the Montessori &ldquo;movement remains largely unstudied
by educational researchers&rdquo; (Whitescarver &amp; Cossentino 2008:
2571). Montessori&rsquo;s pedagogy is discussed among Montessori
educators in professional trade publications such as <em>The AMI
Journal</em> (from the Association Montessori Internationale) and
<em>Montessori Life</em> (from the American Montessori Society), but
academic philosophers of education have, thus far, given her
remarkably little attention. The <em>Journal of the Philosophy of
Education</em>, for example, has published only two articles that take
Montessori as a focus (Frierson 2016a; 2021a) and only a handful that
discuss her in any significant way (e.g., Engelmann 2022).</p>

<p>
This neglect is not due to a lack of philosophical richness within
Montessori&rsquo;s thought. When Montessori returned to the University
of Rome to study philosophy, she explicitly did so &ldquo;wishing to
undertake the study of normal pedagogy and of the principles upon
which it is based&rdquo; (Montessori 1909 [1912, 33]). She studied
philosophical pedagogy with Luigi Credaro, the founder of a journal
devoted to the philosophy of education (the <em>Rivista
Pedagogica</em>, 1908&ndash;39) and an important Italian popularizer
of
 <a href="../johann-herbart/">Johann Friedrich Herbart</a>&rsquo;s
 pedagogy (Credaro 1900 [1915]; see Matellicani 2007: 221&ndash;3;
D&rsquo;Arcangeli 2021). Even while seeking to disclose broader
philosophical insights from the study of children, Montessori saw
herself as following Credaro&rsquo;s lead, with a goal &ldquo;to raise
Pedagogy from the inferior position it has occupied as a secondary
branch of philosophy, to the dignity of a definite science&rdquo;
(Montessori 1909 [1912: 5]).</p>

<p>
Montessori is often seen as part of a broader tradition of progressive
or child-centered pedagogy that includes Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and
Dewey (see Kilpatrick 1914; Kazepides 1979; Mili 2018; Tonner 2022;
Whitescarver &amp; Cossentino 2008; but cf. L&rsquo;Ecuyer 2023), and
she has also been described as a constructivist about education and
child development (see &Uuml;ltanir 2012). During her own life, her
pedagogy often suffered the twin fates of being condemned both as
overly liberal for giving children too much freedom and also overly
constrained or disciplined (see discussion in Quarfood 2022:
76&ndash;85).</p>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy of education has two central tenets that
necessarily operate in tandem: the freedom of the child and the
prepared environment. On the one hand, &ldquo;that freedom is the
basis of pedagogy is&hellip;not the outcome of a theory, but of human
nature itself&rdquo; (18:74). For this reason, children must be
&ldquo;free to choose their own work&rdquo;,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
free&hellip;from the constant external influence of one who wishes to
instruct them&hellip;in order that they may be spontaneously free with
regard to the laws of their inner nature. (17:76)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, &ldquo;the conditions of freedom&rdquo; require
that the child be provided with</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the conditions most favorable to&hellip;development,&hellip;an
environment which will allow the child to express himself
spontaneously&hellip;, and&hellip;such material as is necessary and
sufficient for auto-education. (17:78)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Christine Quarfood connects this interest in creating idyllic prepared
environments with Michel Foucault&rsquo;s concept of the heterotopia,
wherein &ldquo;the utopia of the autonomous child could be
realized&rdquo; (Quarfood 2022: 57; cf. Foucault 1984 [1997: 335]).
Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy of education emphasized providing
children with rich environments within which they would not only find
child-sized furniture and tools for practical life, but also carefully
designed materials enabling them to follow various &ldquo;guiding
instincts&rdquo; towards development (22: 178). She identified an
innate desire for persistent concentration on self-chosen tasks, a
&ldquo;vital instinct&rdquo; oriented towards &ldquo;work&rdquo;,
&ldquo;for without work his personality cannot organize itself and
deviates from the normal lines of its construction&rdquo; (22: 165).
Her pedagogy is grounded on the construction of environments within
which children can find activities that engage their attention and
then the protection of the independence of the child once in those
environments: &ldquo;human beings placed in the most favorable
conditions should be left free to develop themselves&rdquo; (18:9). In
these contexts, Montessori describes a process she calls
&ldquo;normalization&rdquo;, which is not a standardization of
children to a pre-given norm, but rather &ldquo;a psychological
recovery&rdquo; whereby &ldquo;a unique type of child appears, a
&lsquo;new child&rsquo;; but really&hellip;the child&rsquo;s true
&lsquo;personality&rsquo; allowed to construct itself normally&rdquo;
(1:134, 183).</p>

<p>
Gesine D&ouml;rnberg has related the &ldquo;inner creative
powers&rdquo; that Montessori sees as guiding free children with
Schiller&rsquo;s accounts of the &ldquo;Spieltrieb und
Bildungstrieb&rdquo; (drives towards play and towards development),
rightly pointing out that for both Montessori and Schiller,
children&rsquo;s development occurs in response to free activity in
environments conducive to development (see D&ouml;rnberg 2006). Unlike
Schiller, however, Montessori&rsquo;s account of children&rsquo;s
self-directed activity conceptualizes that activity as
&ldquo;work&rdquo; rather than play, though D&ouml;rnberg
interestingly suggests that the difference in focus might be due a
difference between the education of children (Montessori) and that of
adults (Schiller). For the experience of freedom, &ldquo;play&rdquo;
might&mdash;somewhat ironically&mdash;be more important for adults,
for whom work typically has instrumental and productive
connotations.</p>

<p>
Relatedly, Tiziana Pironi has shown how Montessori &ldquo;seems to
take up Ellen Key&rsquo;s challenge&rdquo;, referring to the
Nietzsche-inspired challenge issued by early twentieth century
feminist philosopher Ellen Key, the challenge of developing early
educational programs capable of raising humanity to a higher level.
Pironi argues that while Key emphasized the important role of maternal
love in this elevation and was pessimistic about formal schooling,
Montessori shows how to develop institutions that can free women to
engage in the workplace while providing children with liberty and love
to flourish and develop (Pironi 2010).</p>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s commitment to children&rsquo;s freedom gave rise to
other important features of her pedagogy. Through observing children,
she identified various &ldquo;sensitive periods&rdquo; during which
children are particularly prone to developing various capacities
because of special interest in work related to those developments.
Given this &ldquo;developmentalist&rdquo; view of learning (see Colgan
2016: 132), many of Montessori&rsquo;s central philosophical
insights&mdash;e.g., about ethical life&mdash;play out in different
ways at different stages. For example, as we will see in
 <a href="#AgeInd">&sect;5.1</a>,
 Montessori rejects the view that agency requires adult capacities for
reflection or deliberation, but she does not deny that those
capacities transform the nature of human ethics. One of
Montessori&rsquo;s more controversial educational claims relates to
the role of fantasy in children&rsquo;s education: &ldquo;for children
under age 6, Montessori came to believe that fantasy had no
place&rdquo; (Lillard 2005: 183), and even in elementary years, when
the &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; comes to play an important role in
development, such imaginative exploration must be grounded in truth
(see Lillard 2005: 186). For discussion of imagination in her
pedagogy, see MS 1:161, 9:179&ndash;202; Lillard 2005: 183&ndash;90;
Lillard: 2013.</p>

<p>
Other important features of Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy of education
include her emphasis on sensory education (see, e.g., Montessori 1909
[1912: 167&ndash;223] and
 <a href="#IntEmp">&sect;4.1</a>
 below) and on embodied movement within pedagogy (see, e.g.,
1:123&ndash;140 and
 <a href="#UncEmbMin">&sect;3.4</a>
 below). Moreover, given the centrality of concentrated work,
Montessori sees interruption of children as antithetical to proper
pedagogy (9:16&ndash;17), and she vehemently rejects not only
punishment but also praise within education (1909 [1912: 21&ndash;7,
101&ndash;4]). In order to facilitate auto-education, Montessori
materials make use of what she calls a &ldquo;control of error&rdquo;,
namely mechanisms for self-correction built into materials. For
example, one material&mdash;the cylinder blocks&mdash;consists of</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a set of cylinders&hellip;which fit into corresponding sockets in a
block of wood&hellip;The child begins by fitting them in one at a
time, but finds when he comes to the end that he has made a mistake
[because] one cylinder is left which is too large for the only
remaining hole. (1:225)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consistent with this principle of auto-education, Montessori teaches
social and moral virtues through creating a classroom context within
which children must activity solve problems of social coordination.
For instance,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is only one specimen of each object, and if a piece is in use
when another child wants it, the latter&hellip;will wait for it to be
released&hellip;The child comes to see that he must respect the work
of others, not because someone has said that he must, but because this
is a reality that he meets in his daily experience. There is only one
between many children, so there is nothing for it but to
wait&hellip;We cannot teach this kind of morality to children of
three, but experience can. (1:202&ndash;3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Montessori classrooms are also mixed-age classrooms, in which younger
and older children work together and learn from one another. The
teacher, in these Montessori contexts, prepares the environment,
observes the children and modifies their environment in response to
their needs, and gives short&mdash;and mostly
non-verbal&mdash;presentations on how to use various specialized
materials.</p>

<p>
Importantly, Montessori never saw her philosophy of education as
<em>merely</em> a philosophy of education. Andrew Colgan has argued
that Montessori provides a quasi-Aristotelian response to Samuel
Scheffler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Is-Ought Objection&rdquo; within the
philosophy of education. On Colgan&rsquo;s account, Montessori&rsquo;s
scientific pedagogy provides a basis for distinguishing between
accidental and essential human qualities where &ldquo;accidental
qualities are not likely to inform education, while the essential
aspects of humans are the most applicable&rdquo; (2016: 137). In what
Montessori calls &ldquo;normalization&rdquo;, children left in freedom
in healthy environments disclose what is truly essential for human
flourishing. In that sense, Montessori developed a &ldquo;pedagogical
naturalism&rdquo; (see Frierson forthcoming) within which observant
and caring teacher-scientist-philosophers, through observing free
children in healthy environments, discover fundamental truths about
the human condition.</p>

<h2 id="Met">3. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s metaphysics emphasizes life and spirit as active
forces in the universe, in ways that Steven Gimbel and Anne Emerson
have compared with G. W. F. Hegel&rsquo;s teleological metaphysics
(2009), Harriet Hunt has connected with Bergson&rsquo;s concept of
creative evolution (1912), and Patrick Frierson has called a
&ldquo;metaphysics of life&rdquo; (2018). Several texts provide good
entry points for her metaphysics, including the introduction and first
chapters of Montessori&rsquo;s <em>Pedagogical Anthropology</em> (1910
[1913]), where she directly tackles the evolutionary theories of her
contemporaries; her elementary materials as described in <em>From
Childhood to Adolescence</em> (MS 12) and <em>To Educate the Human
Potential</em> (MS 6; see too Regni 2023: 99&ndash;102), where she
outlines how the universe should be described to elementary children;
and occasional essays that directly tackle metaphysical themes, such
as &ldquo;The Unconscious in History&rdquo; (1948 [1973]) or
&ldquo;Lectures in Cosmic Education&rdquo; (1935&ndash;6
[2007&ndash;9]).</p>

<p>
This section briefly discusses four main themes of Montessori&rsquo;s
metaphysics, namely her vital teleology, what we might call a cosmic
holism or metaphysical ecology, her philosophy of mind (especially as
emergent, embodied, and enacted), and her theology (as it bears on God
and materialism).</p>

<h3 id="VitTelMetLif">3.1 Vital Teleology and the Metaphysics of Life</h3>

<p>
In her <em>Pedagogical Anthropology</em>, Montessori invokes
&ldquo;final causes&rdquo; as fundamental to life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The term <em>final causes</em> refers to a series of phenomena that
are met with only where there is life, and that tend towards a
definite purpose or <em>end</em>. Living organisms take nutriment from
their environment, to the <em>end</em> of assimilating it, that is,
transforming it &hellip; into a &hellip; living part of themselves
&hellip; [F]or example, [consider] the transformation of the
fertilized ovum into the fully developed individual &hellip; Another
form of final cause is seen in the <em>actions</em> of living
creatures, which reveal &hellip; a consciousness that even in its most
obscure forms guides them towards a destined <em>end</em>. (1910
[1913: 40])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Drawing not only from philosophical influences like Hegel,
Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche but also from her contemporaries&rsquo;
biology and especially embryology (e.g., Naegeli and De Vries),
Montessori describes the &ldquo;life&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of
humans and other beings in ways that reflect a broader spirit
operative in world history (see Montessori
 1:39).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 An emphasis on intrinsic, teleological principles in organic,
psychological, and historical development permeates Montessori&rsquo;s
philosophy. Teleology is both individual and species-level, as life
and spirit lead living things (including human beings) to cultivate
their full development and to drive their species towards progress.
This teleological &ldquo;creative energy&rdquo; is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the urge of life for the normal development of the individual. This is
not a casual energy, like the energy of a bomb that explodes. It has a
guide, a very fine directive&mdash;an unconscious directive&mdash;the
aim of which is to develop a normal person [or other organism].
(17:225)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s vital teleology is not limited to living things.
Life not only &ldquo;can be regarded as an energy that maintains life
itself&rdquo;, but it also &ldquo;creates rocks and soil and &hellip;
sustains the harmony of the earth&rdquo; (10:62, 61); it is &ldquo;the
force that creates the world&rdquo; (10:90) and &ldquo;upon which
depend not only the different forms of living beings but also the
evolution of the earth itself&rdquo; (7:104; see too 10:90; 1:49).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The trees &hellip; purify the air, &hellip; the coral &hellip; filters
the sea &hellip; to keep the water pure[. T]he animals that populate
the earth are unconscious of their cosmic mission, but without them
the harmony of creation would not exist. (10:111n)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
She refers to &ldquo;the purpose of nature&rdquo; (e.g., 17:89) and a
&ldquo;cosmic task&rdquo; or &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; (e.g., 17:89;
1:49&ndash;50, 131) and describes &ldquo;the cosmic function of each
living being, and <em>even of inanimate natural objects</em>&rdquo;
(6:24, emphasis added). She claims that &ldquo;Nature is &hellip; a
harmony, a plan of construction&rdquo;, and adds, &ldquo;Everything
fits into the plan: rocks, earth, water, plants, man, etc&rdquo;
(17:89; see too 6:70; 1948 [1973: 10]). She even suggests that life
itself emerged to meet a need for harmony that
<em>preceded</em>&mdash;both metaphysically and temporally&mdash;the
origin of life itself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Besides the <em>hydrosphere</em> and the <em>atmosphere</em> there is
also the immense multitude of vital energies that forms the
<em>biosphere</em>. Were it not for these, were the earth abandoned to
the mercy of non-living energies, it would soon be plunged into the
primitive chaos, into the confusion of the elements. (1948 [1971: 17];
see too 6:17&ndash;18)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="EcoHol">3.2 Ecological Holism</h3>

<p>
As suggested by Montessori&rsquo;s invocation of a plan of nature,
Montessorian teleology&mdash;like Hegel&rsquo;s (cf. Gimbel and
Emerson)&mdash;is not limited to internal teleology within each
organism. Rather, individuals&rsquo; teleological orientations serve a
more holistic end:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[p]lant life and animal alike now have to be considered from two
points of view, and the more important is that of their function in
the cosmic plan. (6:24; see too 17:29)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
one side of evolution deals with&hellip;individual and species
perfection, [a]nother&mdash;and stronger&mdash;factor in evolutionary
processes is concerned with the cosmic function of each living being,
and even of inanimate natural objects, working in collaboration for
the fulfillment of the Purpose of Life in the whole. (6:24)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The emphasis on biological interdependence present from her earliest
works (e.g., 1910 [1913: 39]) anticipates the emergence of ecology as
a fundamental component of biology, a connection Montessori explicitly
cites in 1949, when she described &ldquo;Ecology&rdquo; as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a study&hellip;[that] reveals that [animals] are not here to compete
with each other, but to carry out an enormous work serving the
harmonious upkeep of the earth,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
linking this point with her metaphysical claim that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The purpose of life is to obey the hidden command which ensures
harmony among all and creates an ever better world. We are not created
only to enjoy the world, we are created in order to evolve the cosmos.
(1949: 89&ndash;90; see too 17:87&ndash;90, 165)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some of Montessori&rsquo;s ecological principles are now familiar
facts. Organisms exist in ecosystems and fill various niches within
those ecosystems, niches that both serve eco-systemic purposes and
provide what is necessary for the organisms. Montessori&rsquo;s
account of adaptation shows how individual/species-level fitness and
the ecological fitness are integrated. Organisms adapt to their
environments by serving functions within those environments. But
unlike most contemporary ecologists, Montessori sees a more basic
teleology underlying these processes. For her, the ecological function
of the organism is not merely the result of efficient-causal processes
of selection and (consequent) adaptation. As in the individual case,
teleology is <em>fundamental</em>. Adaptation is central to living
organisms <em>because</em> it provides a mechanism for directing
evolution in a way conducive to the promotion of ecological harmony
and&mdash;in a more Hegelian or Nietzschean vein&mdash;the
&ldquo;evolution&rdquo; of the cosmos (cf. Gimbel &amp; Emerson
2009).</p>

<h3 id="EmeMin">3.3 Emergent Mind</h3>

<p>
Given an overarching teleological and progressive metaphysics within
which new forces arise to bring harmonious unity and complexity to
conflicts at lower levels of organization, Montessori positions
herself well to see the emergence of mind as a natural process. The
mind is a &ldquo;telluric force&rdquo;, to use terminology Montessori
adopts from the geologist Antonio Stoppani (Montessori 1936 [2008/1:
6]; see Stoppani 1898: 68). This force makes use of but supersedes
biological forces in something like the way that biological forces
make use of and supersede chemical forces. The mind marks a higher,
more complex, and more agile form of teleologically-oriented agency
than mere life, and it has laws of its own that are irreducible to
mere biology, but mind is ultimately an aspect of the life of
(conscious) organisms. This biologically-grounded account of
consciousness arguably addresses the so-called hard problem of
consciousness in a way akin to that hinted at by Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s
<em>Mind and Cosmos</em> (Nagel 2012) and also, as we will see, in a
way consonant with her contemporary Henri Bergson (see especially
Bergson 1907 [1911] and Hunt 1912) and with more recent emergentist
and enactive concepts of mind developed by thinkers such as Francisco
Varela, Eleanor Rosch, and Evan Thompson in <em>The Embodied Mind</em>
(1991). Montessori&rsquo;s emphasis on a &ldquo;biological concept of
freedom&rdquo; (18:54) even contributes to understanding meaning and
value in naturalistic terms.</p>

<p>
Within Montessori&rsquo;s teleological metaphysics, more complex
ordered structures give rise to higher-order forces or powers in
nature. Life emerged as a telluric force from complex order within and
among organic molecules, and in a similar way, mental powers emerge in
complex biological systems. Moreover, higher order powers emerge
teleologically, to meet needs implicit in the functioning of the
world; life arose to deal with geological forces that were
insufficient to maintain harmoniously ordered complexity, and psychic
forces arise in response to limits on the part of merely biological
structures. After referring to the &ldquo;<em>hydrosphere&hellip;
atmosphere&hellip;</em>[and] <em>biosphere</em>&rdquo;, Montessori
adds,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Humanity &hellip; contribut[ed] a new energy: the additional envelope
of a <em>psychosphere</em>, which participates in the perfecting of
nature &hellip; A new energy &hellip; has come on our planet, to
remove the tardiness of physical [including merely biological]
energies and to give new impetus to the evolution of life. (1948
[1971: 17, 20])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Beyond her vitalist metaphysics, Montessori contributes to philosophy
of mind through her pedagogy. She argues that in children&rsquo;s
development in utero and early infancy, we directly observe the
development of conscious organisms from unconscious physical states.
We see the &ldquo;creation of faculties, the creation of
consciousness&rdquo; (17:31) from complex but not-yet-conscious life.
Through her lifelong study of how conscious thought and action emerge
in children, Montessori formulated a conceptual apparatus that
emphasizes the &ldquo;creative power of life&rdquo; and the continuity
between life and mind. The infant is a &ldquo;spiritual embryo&rdquo;
(e.g., 1:53ff.; 17:102, 138), and Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy lays
out specific mechanisms by which this embryo develops into an
intelligent and self-conscious human being. She details, for example,
how a child must be &ldquo;exposed to its environment&rdquo; many
times in order to come to conscious awareness of its features (17:37),
how cognition of something depends upon a &ldquo;transfer [of]
information to the subconscious&rdquo; that provokes the
&ldquo;interest&rdquo; required in order for &ldquo;the intelligence
[to] accept it&rdquo; (17:78&ndash;9), and how different
&ldquo;psychic organs &hellip; develop independently [and a]fterwards
unite&rdquo; (17:138). Even &ldquo;[c]onsciousness develops bit by bit
from the beginning. It starts out like a tiny membrane that grows in
the course of time&rdquo; (17:65).</p>

<h3 id="UncEmbMin">3.4 Unconscious and Embodied Mind</h3>

<p>
Given her theory of how mind emerges from biological life, Montessori
offers a sophisticated discussion of unconscious cognition,
and&mdash;like many contemporary philosophers and scientists who
participate in the embodied cognition research program&mdash;she sees
mindedness as a kind of embodiment rather than something distinct from
the moving body.</p>

<p>
With respect to the unconscious, Montessori defines two central
unconscious powers: <em>horme</em>&mdash;a kind of unconscious
volition&mdash;and <em>Mneme</em>&mdash;a kind of unconscious
cognition (or memory) (see 1:54n, 75).</p>

<p>
Horme is the fundamental force of unconscious life, a &ldquo;vital
force within [each living thing] that guides [its] efforts towards
their goal&rdquo;, a &ldquo;force&rdquo; that &ldquo;might be likened
to will power&rdquo; (1:75). She compares <em>horme</em>, albeit
merely by &ldquo;resembl[ance]&rdquo;, to Bergson&rsquo;s
<em>&eacute;lan vitale</em> or Freud&rsquo;s <em>libido</em>, but says
the concept was &ldquo;first proposed&rdquo; by the British
educationalist Percy Nunn (1:75n). On the one hand,
<em>&ldquo;Horme</em> belongs to life in general&rdquo; (1:75) and can
even be called a &ldquo;a great universal power&rdquo; (1:229);
&ldquo;the will of nature&rdquo; can be &ldquo;called horme&rdquo; and
even &ldquo;the roots of every plant&rdquo; manifest something like a
&ldquo;power to choose that &hellip; which is conducive to its
life&rdquo; (1:246). Animal instincts and the teleological tendencies
of all living things are recognizably continuous with the
&ldquo;interests&rdquo; of the newborn in features of its environment
conducive to its development (cf. Thompson 2007: 57&ndash;8). On the
other hand, human infants&rsquo; horme lies on a developmental
continuum that includes adult willing. Unconscious horme is not
<em>identical</em> to its conscious manifestation. Following Nunn,
Montessori defines the &ldquo;will&rdquo; as &ldquo;conscious
horme&rdquo; (1:75; Nunn 1930 [2010]: 23). But the unconscious horme
intrinsic to the life of the human animal in infancy organically and
gradually develops into the conscious (and even self-conscious)
willing of the adult, though a series of &ldquo;successive
stages&hellip;like the gradual rising of the sun whose light increases
until midday&rdquo; (17:38).</p>

<p>
Horme, the most fundamental unconscious structure in
Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy of mind changes through adaptation to
its environment. The susceptibility of horme to modification by
experience is a kind of unconscious <em>memory</em>, to which
Montessori (again following Nunn) gives the name &ldquo;Mneme&rdquo;,
described by Percy Nunn in order to explain unconscious cognition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[W]e shall bring together under a common designation all the varied
phenomena referred by [Samuel] Butler to memory, conscious or
unconscious. Following the German biologist Richard Semon, we shall
speak of such phenomena as <em>mnemic</em> and shall give the name
<em>mnem&eacute;</em> to the property of living substance which they
exemplify. Memory, then, is conscious mneme just as conation is
conscious horme. (Nunn 1930 [2010: 23])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mneme, in its most general form, is a tendency to preserve effects of
environmental interactions in future hormic (conative) tendencies.
Just as &ldquo;life has a tendency to activity&rdquo; (horme), so too
&ldquo;it has the power to acquire and retain impressions&rdquo;
(6:17). As Montessori explains, &ldquo;The impulse to activity leads
to experience, which is retained in the mental organism&rdquo; (6:17).
The concept of Mneme thus links epistemic concepts of knowledge or
cognition, the psychological concept of memory, and the biological
concept of adaptation. Cognition extends basic biological adaptive
tendencies, as Montessori observed in how infants and young children
adapt through an &ldquo;absorbent mind&rdquo; that is a kind of
unconscious memory, but also a psychological version of organismic
adaptation. Both willing and cognition thus have unconscious
correlates that are grounded in the biological life of human beings
and studied in experimental pedagogy.</p>

<p>
Montessori also emphasizes how cognition and volition are essentially
embodied not merely in human brains but in the entire life of the
human organism. The brain is one organ in a network of organs and
processes that together manifest humans&rsquo; minds in the world. For
example, &ldquo;the movements of the vocal organs in language and
those of the hand in &hellip; working out an idea&rdquo; are
&ldquo;true &lsquo;motor characteristics&rsquo; connected with
mind&rdquo; (22:67). With respect to pedagogy in particular,
Montessori develops an approach that sees cognition as essentially
embodied and enacted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we wish to make physical observations [related to intellectual
development], why should we pay attention to the organ that only has
<em>some</em> relation to the development of the intellect, when we
can directly follow the intellect by observing the <em>whole
child</em>? It is the <em>whole body</em> that concerns us. (18:62,
emphasis shifted)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like contemporary
 <a href="../embodied-cognition/">embodied cognition</a>
 theorists, Montessori sees cognition as exercised by the whole body
rather than merely the brain, though her emphasis is on the practical
pedagogical task of making bodies minded through education.</p>

<p>
Given the emphasis on embodied cognition in practice, Montessori
emphasizes cognition as something active (what we would now call
 &ldquo;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/#EnacCogn">enactive cognition</a>&rdquo;):
 &ldquo;mind and movement are part of the same entity&rdquo; (1:126),
&ldquo;by the most intelligent being we do not mean only the one who
gathers most but also the being who moves the most&rdquo; (18:165),
and &ldquo;Only by action can the child learn&rdquo; (1:154).
Arguably, &ldquo;the first true Montessori revolution&rdquo; was the
claim that &ldquo;movement and cognition [are] deeply
intertwined&rdquo; (Foschi 2012: 132; see 1:126, 154). Similarly,
contemporary philosophers of mind who advocate embodied approaches to
cognition often also encourage replacing conceptions of the mind as a
representational or computational process with thinking of the mind as
a kind of embodied <em>activity</em>. Alva N&ouml;e, for example, says
that &ldquo;consciousness is more like dancing than it is like
digestion&rdquo; (2009: xii).</p>

<p>
Both Montessori&rsquo;s metaphysics of life and her pedagogical
practice directed her attention to an embodied and enactive philosophy
of mind within which unconscious cognitive structures of horme
(unconscious volition) and Mneme (unconscious memory or cognition)
play important roles.</p>

<h3 id="GodNat">3.5 God and Nature</h3>

<p>
In <em>Mind and Cosmos</em>, Thomas Nagel calls for a metaphysics that
might include teleology and that would provide a plausible account of
mind, consciousness, and values; Montessori&rsquo;s metaphysics
provides just such an account. Nagel, however, explicitly seeks a
&ldquo;<em>secular</em> conception&rdquo; (2012: 22), while Montessori
often freely connects nature&rsquo;s purpose with a &ldquo;governing
intelligence&rdquo; or &ldquo;Divine Spirit&rdquo; (see 6:28, 22:169).
Moreover, Montessori was a practicing Catholic throughout her life,
explicitly discusses God in several of her published works, and
applied her pedagogical theories to religious instruction (see
especially 1929 [1965: 3&ndash;20]; MS 19). Within contemporary
scholarship on Montessori, the role of theism and religious (Catholic)
concepts has become a significant issue, with views ranging from
describing &ldquo;the religious and Christian sensibility of
Montessori&rdquo; (Honegger Fresco 2018: 112; see too De Giorgi 2013,
2018, 2019) to those that emphasize her &ldquo;series of open
conflicts with the Catholic Church&rdquo; (Romano 2020: 204; cf.
Foschi &amp; Cicciola 2019; Moretti &amp; Dieguez 2018, 2019). Others
emphasize her connections to theosophy (Giovetti 2009), including
claiming that &ldquo;Montessori was a theosophist&rdquo; (Wilson 1985;
see too Wylie 2008). Giacomo Cives helpfully describes the overall
tenor of the debate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the interpretation of Montessori&rsquo;s [religious] thought&hellip;in
De Giorgi and Foschi&hellip;[is] fundamentally dialectical, in a
primarily Catholic key for the former and secular for the latter.
(2015: 123)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Meanwhile Patrick Frierson (forthcoming) argues that
Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy of religion can contribute to debates
about the hiddenness of God, the role of embodiment and liturgy in
religion, and the connection between a moral sense and divine
commands; and Natalie Carnes (2015: 319)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
continues the work of feminist and liberationist theologians by noting
the importance of children to theological reflection&hellip;by
establishing Montessori as a figure worthy of theological
consideration,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
particularly in what Carnes calls her &ldquo;supple theological
anthropology that offers a sophisticated and persuasive approach to
original sin&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Ultimately, Montessori uses the concept of God to direct attention
back to her philosophy&rsquo;s methodological and ethical core: the
child. She emphasizes &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s own powers, given to
him by the Creator&rdquo; (1929 [1965: 4]) the &ldquo;wonderful powers
of divine creation in the child&rsquo;s soul&rdquo; (1929 [1965: 5]),
and the ways that &ldquo;children in spiritual freedom disclose the
will of God&rdquo; (in De Giorgi 2013: 325&ndash;6, my translation).
When she seems to theologize pedagogy, saying &ldquo;we must not just
see the child, but God in him&rdquo;, she immediately makes this
theology immanent and naturalized with<em>in</em> the child: &ldquo;We
must respect the laws of creation in him. We must not think we can
make him; if we do, we are spoiling the Divine work&rdquo; (7:96). Her
personal faith in God and her theistic statements in writings directed
towards religious believers thus primarily serve to enhance the
dignity of the child.</p>

<h2 id="Epi">4. Epistemology</h2>

<h3 id="IntEmp">4.1 Interested Empiricism</h3>

<p>
As Andrew Colgan notes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s Method presents the conditions of an
epistemologically-sensitive education, a philosophy contingent on
epistemological questions of the validity of the senses and induction.
(2016: 127)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Her broadly pragmatist epistemology is &ldquo;hierarchical&rdquo; in
that &ldquo;perceptual knowledge (or lower-order concepts) are the
building blocks of higher-order concepts&rdquo; (Colgan 2016: 128, see
too Lillard 2005: 21). Her epistemology is hierarchical or empiricist
in that she identified the senses as &ldquo;the foundation of the
entire intellectual organism&rdquo; such that &ldquo;there can be
neither ideas nor imagination, nor any intellectual construction, if
we do not presuppose an activity of the senses&rdquo; (18:260, cf.
17:193&ndash;4). While Montessori shares with empiricists such as John
Locke and David Hume a conviction that all ideas have their origin in
the senses, however, she differs from them in (at least) four
important ways.</p>

<p>
First, Montessori&rsquo;s empiricism is interested, in the sense that
sensory processes are volitional:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the world around us, we do not see everything &hellip; but only
some things that suit us &hellip; We do not concentrate our attention
haphazardly, &hellip; but according to an inner drive. (18:185)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Consistent with her enactive view of the mind
 (<a href="#EmeMin">&sect;3.3</a>),
 perception is a modification of a dynamic, embodied system actively
engaged with a world.</p>

<p>
Second, and following from the way senses are interested, Montessori
rejects the broadly Lockean notion that senses are passive. Partly
because of her conviction that life is essentially active, but
primarily through her work actually educating the senses of young
children, she recognizes even raw sensory experience as requiring an
&ldquo;attention which&hellip;is not passive, but corresponds to an
activity&rdquo; because</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
stimuli will appeal in vain to the senses, if the internal cooperation
of attention be lacking &hellip; It is not enough that an object
should be before our eyes to make us see it; it is necessary that we
should fix our attention upon it; an internal process, preparing us to
receive the impression of the stimulus, is essential. (15:229;
9:172)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An infant &ldquo;sees only a part, determined by his feelings and
interests&rdquo; (22:49), and even among mature epistemic agents,
&ldquo;untrained persons&rdquo; cannot see &ldquo;stellar phenomena by
means of the telescope or the details of a cell under the
microscope&rdquo; (9:99). As Colgan puts it, in this &ldquo;active
consciousness view&rdquo;,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the child must begin to discriminate the sensations and link them to
their sources by way of acting in the world and awaiting feedback
(from sensations to perceptions). (2016, 134n18, 131)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Third, Montessori sees sensory awareness as <em>trainable</em> and
<em>cultivatable</em>. Unlike Locke, for whom sensory distinctions are
accomplished &ldquo;without &hellip; labour; but at first view, by [a]
natural power&rdquo; (Locke 1689: IV.i.4 [1975: 526]), Montessori
observed that even the most basic sensory discrimination requires, for
its development, cultivation through &ldquo;sensory gymnastics&rdquo;
or &ldquo;sensory exercises&rdquo; (Montessori 1909 [1912:
168&ndash;76]). Her more thoroughgoing empiricism provides an answer
to David Hume&rsquo;s famous <em>missing shade of blue</em>, which
Hume raises as a possible counter-example to strict empiricism. Hume
suggests that if one experienced a range of colors &ldquo;except one
particular shade of blue&rdquo; (1748: &sect;2.8), one would be able
imagine this shade and thereby form an idea one had never experienced.
Montessori, however, found that discrimination among shades is not
merely a passive capacity but an acquired skill. She developed a
series of color tablets of different shades on which students train
their sensory discrimination through a series of increasingly
difficult distinctions. As it turns out, it is quite difficult even to
properly distinguish shades of colors physically present to
one&rsquo;s senses; even &ldquo;many&hellip;adults&rdquo; are often
unable to &ldquo;distinguish shades of color&rdquo; (17:195). To
develop the ability to <em>see</em> colors, much less to imagine them,
requires not only experience, but sensory exercises in which one
&ldquo;keep their attention fixed in these exercises in such a way
that they will continue the exercises &hellip; until they have
developed the ability to distinguish the shades&rdquo; (18:160).</p>

<p>
Fourth and finally, Montessori&rsquo;s empiricist epistemology holds
open substantial space for a broadly empiricist account of unconscious
intelligence. Not only are many of the interests that guide attention
unconscious, but &ldquo;every human being does his most intelligent
work in the subconscious, where psychic complexes &hellip; organize
themselves to carry out work which we are unable to do
consciously&rdquo; (6:13). Given the broadly empiricist notion that
cognitive activity consists largely of &ldquo;associative or
reproductive activities&rdquo; (9:147; see Hume 1740 [1978:
12&ndash;13]), and given a philosophy of mind within which
<em>conscious</em> ideas and beliefs are just forms of unconscious
&ldquo;Mneme&rdquo;, Montessori can extend &ldquo;what used to be
called the Association of Ideas&rdquo; to the association of what
Montessori calls &ldquo;engrams&rdquo; (borrowed from Richard Semon)
and describes as unconscious &ldquo;traces of [experiences] left
behind in the mneme&rdquo; which traces &ldquo;make a mind
powerful&rdquo; when &ldquo;sub-conscious &hellip; association[s] of
engrams [that are] spontaneous&hellip;organize themselves to carry out
work which we are unable to do consciously&rdquo; (6:11&ndash;13).</p>

<p>
Overall, then, Montessori develops a distinctive empiricist
epistemology, informed by her pedagogical naturalism. The senses are
the foundation of intelligence, knowledge, and understanding, and
further developments occur by means of principles of association
amongst ideas formed in the light of experience. (For more
specifically on concept development, see Colgan 2016: 131&ndash;4. For
a critique of her epistemology for not taking sufficiently seriously
the Bergsonian idea of an innate human &ldquo;tendency to
relate&rdquo;, see Hunt 1912: 19&ndash;20; and for critique of her
sensory gymnastics as &ldquo;based on an outworn and cast-off
psychological theory&rdquo;, see Kilpatrick 1914: 42&ndash;62). Her
view is empiricist, though she focuses more on the cultivation of the
senses as elements in an embodied cognitive system than on sense data
as brute input. Moreover, her treatment of senses as active,
interest-governed, and cultivatable capacities, and her emphasis on
unconscious processing, distinguish her empiricism from that of
philosophical predecessors like Locke and Hume.</p>

<h3 id="IntVir">4.2 Intellectual Virtues</h3>

<p>
In the context of her interested empiricism and concern with cognitive
<em>development</em>, Montessori elaborates a distinctive
 <a href="../epistemology-virtue/">virtue epistemology</a>.
 Like virtue reliabilists such as Ernest Sosa (1991; 2007) or John
Greco (2002; see too Battaly 2008), Montessori sees basic cognitive
faculties as faculties the reliable exercise of which is epistemically
excellent, but like virtue responsibilists such as Linda Zagzebski or
Jason Baehr (Zagzebski 1996; Baehr 2011; 2016), she affirms that
agents must be able to be responsible for genuine intellectual
virtues. She reconciles these views by showing that even apparently
basic capacities such as sensation are cultivatable and due to
exercises of agency.</p>

<p>
Beyond this theoretical contribution to virtue epistemological theory,
Montessori has important insights that deepen our understanding of
particular traits often considered intellectual virtues. Patrick
Frierson (2016b; 2020) has discussed Montessori&rsquo;s distinctive
accounts of epistemic character, intellectual love, sensory acuity,
intellectual patience and quickness, intellectual humility, and
intellectual courage. Moreover, consistent with Montessori&rsquo;s
emphasis on embodied cognition, she also sees physical dexterity or
excellence in intelligent movement as a kind of intellectual virtue
(see, e.g., 1:123&ndash;140). Beyond those virtues, Montessori&rsquo;s
emphasis on &ldquo;deeply engaged states of concentration&rdquo;, as
well as her specific pedagogical practices, enhance what has come to
be known as flow (Rathunde 2023: 271; see too Rathunde 2001; Rathunde
&amp; Csikszentmihalyi 2005). Montessorian freedom and flexibility can
also contribute to creativity (Fleming et al. 2019; Lillard 2005:
163&ndash;4). Angeline Lillard provided, and regularly updates, the
most comprehensive discussion of Montessori&rsquo;s method in relation
to contemporary psychological appraisals of development and proper
functioning (see Lillard 2005 and subsequent editions).</p>

<h2 id="MorPhi">5. Moral Philosophy</h2>

<p>
In the context of her pedagogical work, Montessori sought in
&ldquo;the study of the child&rdquo; an &ldquo;infinitely wider
influence, extending to all human questions&rdquo; and in particular
the &ldquo;unknown quantity, the discovery of which might enable the
adult to solve his individual and social problems&rdquo; (22:1). This
work disclosed a &ldquo;new child&rdquo; and new possibilities for
human flourishing. In particular, Montessori came to see that children
have a sort of agency that strives to do challenging work
independently and that, when placed in conditions conducive to
flourishing, gives rise to several crucial Montessori virtues,
including what she calls &ldquo;character&rdquo; (1:174),
&ldquo;respect for the work of others and consideration for the rights
of others&rdquo; (9:70), and a deep sort of unity she calls
&ldquo;social solidarity&rdquo; (1:237). Moreover, by focusing on the
development of moral life in children, and particularly young
children, Montessori drew attention to the essentially embodied and
enacted nature of (moral) agency and ethical life.</p>

<h3 id="AgeInd">5.1 Agency and Independence</h3>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="#PhiEdu">&sect;2</a>,
 freedom lies at the core of Montessori&rsquo;s pedagogical practice.
Children must be left in freedom to make their own choices about what
activities to engage in and what work to do. Given her conception of
horme as continuous with self-conscious volition, this pedagogy
involves a deference to agency&mdash;even when unconscious&mdash;as
worthy of direct respect. Human beings have a natural teleological
orientation and when given freedom in conditions conducive to
flourishing, we naturally pursue that flourishing. Thus, rather than
disciplining supposedly unruly inclinations, Montessori seeks to open
up space for children&rsquo;s &ldquo;guiding instincts&rdquo; to
direct them. Unlike other animals, however, the human child
&ldquo;must construct his own adaptation&rdquo; (17:82).
Children&rsquo;s &ldquo;absorbent mind&rdquo; (1: passim; 17:85)
allows for psychological adaptation to the cultures in which they
develop in a way that is consistent with their own agency and requires
no coercion, and that eventually gets incorporated into the
self-conscious agency of the adult. Given opportunities to exercise
agency, children seek a &ldquo;conquest of independence&rdquo; by
which they &ldquo;aim directly and energetically at functional
independence&rdquo; (1:75).</p>

<p>
In her context, Montessori&rsquo;s emphasis on children&rsquo;s agency
also came into conflict with prevalent views about original sin; many
saw Montessori as denying the presence of original sin infecting the
agency of young children (see Giovetti 2009: 59; Cives 2019: 229;
Quarfood 2022: 194), to which she responded that while she did not
deny the presence of original sin, children&rsquo;s agency was
actually less corrupted than adult agency because it lacked the
negative effects of accrued self-conscious sins (see De Giorgi 2019:
78&ndash;9; Quarfood 2022: 195).</p>

<p>
With respect to recent philosophy of action and philosophy of
childhood, Montessori&rsquo;s views set herself apart from dominant
trends that take adult agency as paradigmatic for the nature of agency
and that view paternalism towards children as <em>prima facie</em>
acceptable (e.g., Schapiro 1999). Rather than seeing second-order
reflection and/or rational deliberation as essential for the sort of
agency worthy of direct (non-paternalistic) respect, Montessori sees
these features as adult modifications of a more basic and
respect-worthy sense of autonomous agency, one that consists of
persistent work on self-chosen tasks governed by (first-order) norms
of excellence. Relatedly, Montessori&rsquo;s view on childhood can be
seen in terms of Nussbaum&rsquo;s notions of internal and external
capabilities:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
children&rsquo;s incapacities for autonomy are best understood as the
consequence of an absence of external conditions necessary for
children to exercise capacities they already have internally, rather
than intrinsic limitations based on their stage of life while many
think that children lack the internal capability for self-direction.
(Frierson 2016a: 332)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s child-centered pedagogy respects children&rsquo;s
agency and resists approaches to education that emphasize
externally-imposed discipline and correction (see, e.g., Montessori
1909 [1912: 86&ndash;106]).</p>

<h3 id="ChaResSol">5.2 Character, Respect, and Solidarity</h3>

<p>
Montessori refers to free children in environments conducive to
freedom as &ldquo;normalized&rdquo; (see 1:202, 22:133), by which she
does not mean that they are brought to conform to some pre-given set
of norms or that they come to be identical in some way, but that they
undergo &ldquo;a psychological recovery, a return to <em>normal
conditions</em>&rdquo; (22:134). Whereas children subject to
discipline, oppression, or deprivation have to repress natural
expressions of their agency, children in conditions of freedom can be
fully human and thereby flourish as human beings. This process
provides Montessori with a naturalistic means for identifying
conditions of human excellence (see Colgan 2016: 136&ndash;7). Three
key pillars are central to Montessorian ethical life: character,
respect, and solidarity.</p>

<p>
Montessori introduces an extensive discussion of character in <em>The
Absorbent Mind</em> by explaining that &ldquo;ideas remain vague in
all parts of the world as to what character really is&rdquo; (1:173).
In the context of that discussion, she applies to the concept of
character elements that she elsewhere associates with normalization,
work, or independence. Character in this sense involves the capacity
and tendency to pursue self-chosen and norm-governed work in ways that
involve persistence, concentration, and a striving for increased
perfection. Unlike Aristotelean character, which is a matter of habit
and, if virtuous, of the substantive &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of
one&rsquo;s habits, Montessorian character is virtually identical with
agency as such, or with attentive work, or with a certain sort of
independence. In important respects, her concept of character draws
from Nietzschean notions of self-perfection and elevation of the
individual, as emphasized by Martin Simons (1988, passim). To have
character is to be attracted by self-elevation towards excellence, or
what Montessori often calls &ldquo;perfection&rdquo;. Character is
this sense is arguably the preeminent Montessorian moral value.</p>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s second component of ethical life, namely
&ldquo;respect&rdquo;, is specifically &ldquo;for the work of
others&rdquo; (9:70, see too 1:202). Respect takes as its object not
others&rsquo; mere choices or preferences or pleasures but their
self-directed and norm-governed work. This respect for others is both
a moral requirement and a natural psychological tendency of those with
character. The obligatory nature of respect shows up with children who
have not yet established character, for whom a teacher or caregiver
may need to &ldquo;be a policeman&rdquo; to protect the free activity
of other children (17: 229). More fundamentally, however, character is
a natural outgrowth of character: &ldquo;after these
manifestations&rdquo; of character</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a true discipline is established, the most obvious results of which
are closely related to what we will call &ldquo;respect for the work
of others and consideration for the rights of others&rdquo;.
(9:70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Respect is not a <em>limitation</em> of one&rsquo;s own agency but the
natural fruit of its development. Gimbel and Emerson link this
fulfillment of individual in the social whole to similar themes in
Hegel (2009: 48), while Frierson shows how it responds to
Nietzsche&rsquo;s overly egoistic conception of the
<em>&Uuml;bermensch</em> (see 2022: 71&ndash;2). Perhaps because the
paradigmatic forms of respect involve leaving one another to complete
their work without interruption, William Kilpatrick (see
 <a href="#ResMon">&sect;8</a>
 below) objects that Montessori does not sufficiently emphasize social
cooperation in her classrooms.</p>

<p>
Montessori does have a place for more substantive forms of social
cooperation, however. She calls the third element of ethical life
&ldquo;social solidarity&rdquo; or &ldquo;society by cohesion&rdquo;
(1:237, 17:233). Consistent with broadly Hegelian notions of
individual in society (cf. Gimbel &amp; Emerson 2009), she advocates a
social unity that goes beyond mere respect, one within which different
individuals unite into a shared will or shared agent. There are other
elements of a fully developed Montessorian ethic, including the role
of obedience and hierarchy in social organization (see 1:229&ndash;38,
12:8). Character, respect, and solidarity, however, form the most
basic pillars of human flourishing and ethical life.</p>

<h3 id="EmbEth">5.3 Embodied Ethics</h3>

<p>
One relatively unique feature of Montessori&rsquo;s moral theory is
her emphasis on the <em>embodied</em> nature of ethical life. Her
pedagogical concerns and embodied notion of cognition included an
embodied approach to moral virtue. To even have a &ldquo;will&rdquo;
at all, &ldquo;some mastery of the body is also necessary&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Voluntary action &hellip; increases in degree as its dependent
muscles perfect themselves and so achieve the necessary conditions for
seconding its efforts&rdquo; (9:137, 140).</p>

<p>
Montessorian virtues are thus embodied virtues. &ldquo;Character
formation&rdquo; is like learning the piano (17:236&ndash;7) and
requires that one &ldquo;make a selection among the muscular
coordinations of which he is capable, persist in them, and thus begin
to make such coordinations permanent&rdquo; (9:129). Likewise with
respect and solidarity, &ldquo;When [one] begins to respect the work
of others&rdquo;, one must be able to &ldquo;walk about without
knocking against his companions, without stamping on their feet,
without overturning the table&rdquo; (9:129&ndash;30; cf. 17:139). A
child who must &ldquo;wait for [a work material] to be released
&hellip; every hour of the day for years &hellip; respecting others
and &hellip; waiting one&rsquo;s turn&rdquo;, learns bodily practices
of mutual respect, such as standing, diverting attention to avoid
interruption, speaking softly if necessary to get attention, and
lifting the replaced material with care. Eventually, embodied ethical
practices &ldquo;become a habitual part of life&rdquo; (1:202).
Moreover, concrete bodily movements constitute forms of &ldquo;grace
and courtesy&rdquo;, &ldquo;exactitude and grace of action&rdquo; that
is a kind of &ldquo;will-power&rdquo; (see Bettman 2003; Montessori
1912: 84, 353, 365&ndash;66; cf. 17:139). This emphasis on embodied
grace and courtesy adds important embodied dimensions to contemporary
discussions of the role of politeness in moral life (e.g., Buss
1999).</p>

<h2 id="Fem">6. Feminism</h2>

<p>
Montessori was a feminist before becoming a pedagogue and before
starting formal study in philosophy. From her childhood, she broke
barriers for women in Italy, such as by attending a science and
engineering school traditionally reserved for male students and then
becoming one of the first women to attend (and graduate from) medical
school (see Kramer 1976: 32&ndash;51; Babini &amp; Lama 2000:
31&ndash;43). She represented Italy at major international
women&rsquo;s congresses in 1896 in Berlin, where she argued for equal
pay for equal work and represented Italian women&rsquo;s opposition to
colonialism, and then again in 1899 in London (see Kramer 1976: 55;
Moretti 2021: 105). As a student and young professor, she supported
feminist organizations such as Associazione per la Donna (Association
for the Woman) and Pensiero e Azione (Thought and Action), including
working with the latter to promote women&rsquo;s suffrage (see Moretti
2021: 34&ndash;38, 104; Babini &amp; Lama 2000: 164&ndash;81,
231&ndash;37; Babini 2023: 23). We could even</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
go so far as to assert that feminism, understood in the broadest sense
as a concern with the condition of women in social, political, and
even private political life, was the guiding thread of the
intellectual and scientific formation of the young Montessori. (Babini
2023: 21; cf. Babini &amp; Lama 2000).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although &ldquo;her involvement with feminist associations ceased to
be a major active influence on her, &hellip; it would continue to
resonate with her work for years to come&rdquo; (Moretti 2021: 68; see
too Babini &amp; Lama 2000: 155&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s feminism fits within moderate nineteenth-century
Italian &ldquo;practical feminism&rdquo; (Babini 2023: 21; cf. Babini
&amp; Lama 2000: 85&ndash;90; Moretti 2021: 36; Buttafuoco 1988).
Rather than primarily focusing on political power (e.g., suffrage),
practical feminists emphasized women&rsquo;s capacities to take on
active roles within civil society. Montessori&rsquo;s success as a
doctor, researcher, co-director of a major psychiatric institution,
and university professor fit well within this practical feminist
agenda:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the particular form of her feminist militancy&hellip;was always
focused on demonstrating the professional capacities of women in
traditionally masculine fields. (Babini &amp; Lama 2000: 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Relatedly, when she developed her pedagogy, Montessori created
classroom contexts in which both boys and girls explored their
interests and developed freely in healthy environments that did not
distinguish gender roles, and in which children of all genders
demonstrated intellectual and moral development beyond expectations of
contemporary psychologists and pedagogues (see too Pironi 2010,
regarding how this approach was influenced by Ellen Key&rsquo;s calls
for more liberatory education).</p>

<p>
At the same time, Montessori took practical feminism in a specifically
scientific direction, developing a &ldquo;scientific feminism&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;science understood as a form of feminist militancy&rdquo;,
with several dimensions (Babini &amp; Lama 2000: 85 and passim; Babini
2023: 23). Most obviously, Montessori showed how women contribute to
scientific fields, including medicine, anthropology, and properly
scientific pedagogy. She also direct tackled misogynistic
anthropological theories that purported to show women&rsquo;s
essential/biological inferiority to men. She cites</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a very widespread belief of long standing that is confirmed in the
name of science: that woman is biologically, in other words totally,
inferior, that the volume of her brain is condemned by nature to an
inferiority against which nothing can prevail (1910 [1913: 256])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and, without endorsing phrenological methodology as such, she shows
how the best phrenological research available at the time
&ldquo;arrived at an opposite conclusion: namely, that they can
demonstrate a greater development of brain in woman&rdquo; (1910
[1913: 257]). She highlights the &ldquo;contradiction between existing
anthropological and social conditions&rdquo; (1910 [1913: 258]) and
argues for elevating women&rsquo;s status.</p>

<p>
In addition to these scientific contributions, Montessori&rsquo;s
scientific feminism promoted scientific literacy as a means for
elevating women&rsquo;s status in society. Montessori reportedly said,
&ldquo;my wish is for women to fall in love with scientific
reasoning&rdquo; (Kramer 1976: 80) and Babini explains,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
With this unusual but intentional wording Maria Montessori sought to
identify rationality itself as a guide to female conduct, even in the
most personal and intimate choices, including marriage&hellip;The
choice of motherhood was thus referred back to a female consciousness
&ldquo;illuminated&rdquo; by science. (Babini 2023: 22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Montessori hoped to elevate women&rsquo;s authority in both social
life and their own personal lives through equipping them with the
scientific fluency by which they could demonstrate rational bases for
their claims.</p>

<p>
In specifically promoting scientific education in areas related to
motherhood and sexuality, Montessori advocated a kind of
&ldquo;maternal&rdquo; feminism, consistent with an overall trend
within Italian feminism wherein &ldquo;women were encouraged to fight
for their rights without relinquishing the putatively defining traits
of their gender, especially their reproductive functions&rdquo;
(Moretti 2021: 36), and also influenced by Ellen Key&rsquo;s feminist
emphasis on the value of maternal love and the tensions between
maternity and freedom (see Key 1909; Pironi 2010). Montessori warns
that women ignorant of science lack both knowledge and power and can
be &ldquo;made the instrument for the birth of weak [and] diseased
children&rdquo; (1910 [1913: 473]). Conversely, as early as 1902,
Montessori said,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Women&rsquo;s social victory will be a maternal victory, one destined
to ameliorate, to render stronger the human species. [A woman,] after
having gone on to conquer social labor, will take a further step: she
will conquer her biological labor, which is the true goal of feminism:
the victory of her own children. (quoted in Babini 2023: 22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage has been &ldquo;criticized by Italian feminist
historians&rdquo; (see Babini 2023: 22), and Montessori&rsquo;s
invocation of broadly eugenic ideas of &ldquo;weakly, diseased, or
degenerate children&rdquo; (Montessori 1910 [1913: 473]) is equally
subject to criticism. In promoting this maternal feminism, Montessori
also risks &ldquo;biologism&rdquo; or &ldquo;biological
determinism&rdquo;, which &ldquo;discounts a history of personal,
social, and political efforts that aim at affirming women&rsquo;s
diversity&rdquo; (Moretti 2021: 37; see too Botti 2007: 39&ndash;40).
Consistent with her teleological vision of humanity, Montessori
emphasizes women&rsquo;s role in the development of the human species,
though her maternal feminism is not entirely as traditional as it
might seem. While not challenging the gender essentialism that links
femininity and maternity, not only do her classrooms and pedagogical
writings consistently challenge gender stereotypes, but even within
her association of women and reproduction, her primary emphasis
remains squarely on empowering women over their reproductive
capacities. Her &ldquo;Sexual morality in education&rdquo;, for
example, presented at the National Congress of Italian Women in 1908
(Montessori 1912), sought to empower women within domestic and social
life (see Babini &amp; Lama 2000: 240&ndash;244), and she even
condemned marriage as a patriarchal institution in which &ldquo;the
wife is a slave, for she has married in ignorance and has
neither&hellip;knowledge nor&hellip;power&rdquo; (1910 [1913:
473]).</p>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s feminism was also, from the start, a pacifist
feminism (see
 <a href="#PeaEduRigChi">&sect;7</a>).
 At her first international women&rsquo;s conference, she combined
advocacy for women&rsquo;s rights with condemnations of colonialism,
and her work with Associazione per la Donna starting in 1896 included
&ldquo;launch[ing] a petition against the colonial occupations in East
Africa&rdquo; (Moretti 2021: 104&ndash;5). As Moretti shows,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
these early political efforts [on behalf of women] were intertwined
with the educator&rsquo;s pedagogical work and prompted her to start
thinking of an approach to education that could transform children
into proponents of peace. (Moretti 2021: 105)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, within a maternal feminism oriented towards equipping
women to foster the improvement of humanity, Montessori saw peace as
one of its greatest fruits:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As soon as she [woman] becomes a free human being with her own social
rights, she will begin to work for peace; she will know how to ignite
the divine light among the minds that lose it in selfishness, and
instill in hearts the holy love of humanity&mdash;which is widespread
maternal love in the world. (Montessori 1899 [2019: 7], quoted in
Moretti 2021: 34)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Before closing this section, it&rsquo;s worth adding one final
contribution of Montessori&rsquo;s feminism to her broader philosophy.
Fundamental to her philosophical methodology is profound awareness of
often-invisible oppressions of children, as adults paternalistically
care for them in ways that ultimately undermine their dignity and
development. In those contexts, she often draws on struggles for
women&rsquo;s rights as analogies for children&rsquo;s rights.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Some time ago, a very important question arose&mdash;that of the role
of women&hellip;The same kinds of things were said at that time about
women as are now being said about children and their role in society.
In those days, too, it seemed absurd to speak of women as forgotten
human beings. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve neglected women, you say? How can
that be, when we do everything possible for them, when we love them so
much, when we protect them and are ready to die for them, when we work
all our lives for them&rdquo;. (10:45)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just as patronizing, paternalistic treatment of women wore a veneer of
love while utterly neglecting dignity, so too with children:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Yes, of course, we all love children, we love them a great deal, but
we do not appreciate them for what they really are&hellip;We do not do
what we should for them, because we have no idea what it is we should
do, what place they should occupy in society&hellip;The adult commits
a serious error when he takes himself for the child&rsquo;s creator
and believes he must do everything for him&hellip;And all he succeeds
in being is a dictator, whose wishes the child must blindly obey. The
adult has considered this very kind of dictatorship to be one of his
own social problems, but he has never regarded it as a social problem
of children. (10:45&ndash;6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Montessori was a feminist before she was an advocate for children, and
feminism provides a lens through which she saw the intense oppression
of children. Maternal feminism showed her the severe stakes of
women&rsquo;s oppression in ways that highlighted the importance of
advocating for children. Scientific feminism provided a context for
pursuing and propagating the knowledge needed to identify and overcome
tyrannies that destroy women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s lives.
Pacifist feminism highlighted the role that improved conditions for
women and children will ultimately play for the future of humanity
itself.</p>

<h2 id="PeaEduRigChi">7. Peace, Education, and the Rights of the Child</h2>

<p>
One of Montessori&rsquo;s most oft-quoted claims is that
&ldquo;establishing peace is the work of education&rdquo; (10: 21),
and one of the most important recent developments in Montessori
scholarship is Erica Moretti&rsquo;s <em>The Best Weapon for
Peace</em> (2021), in which she shows in detail the extent to which
Montessori&rsquo;s pedagogy was developed with peace-work in mind.
(See too Parkin 2024, who defends the view that Montessori is what he
calls an &ldquo;educational pacifist&rdquo;.) For Montessori, the
&ldquo;goal was peace; teaching was the method&rdquo; (Moretti 2021:
4), and this interest in peace extended from feminist struggles that
preceded her work in education through nominations of Montessori for
the Nobel Peace Prize near the end of her life. Throughout,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the educator repeatedly reconceived her theory of peace, with each
revision expanding to include a larger set of relationships and
agents. Her vision evolved in concentric circles of influence, first
as a form of harmony between the child&rsquo;s own body and immediate
environment, then with the family, and then further outward with the
nation-state and the world. (Moretti 2021: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many of Montessori&rsquo;s writings on peace are held in archives with
curated access, particularly in the Association Montessori
Internationale archives in Amsterdam; the best published collection of
philosophical works on peace is her <em>Education and Peace</em>
(Montessori MS 10). This work lays out a detailed diagnosis of the
state of the world when the speeches collected there were delivered
(1932&ndash;9, cf. Van Hook 2023). There Montessori highlights the
fundamental interconnectedness of human beings and the irrationality
of war, emphasizing, for example, that &ldquo;The impoverishment of
one nation does not make another nation richer&rdquo; and pointing out
how</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The [first world] war in Europe has already shown that the victors
have not gained new energies and benefits from their victory, as
victors did in the past. An entirely new phenomenon has occurred:
defeated peoples have become a danger, a burden, an obstacle. The
victors must aid them and help them get back on their feet.
(10:22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
She discusses how mass communication, rapid transportation, and
economic interdependence have transformed human beings into a
&ldquo;single organism, one nation&rdquo;, though this unity is
something of which &ldquo;we are not yet fully aware&rdquo;
 (10:22&ndash;3).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Into this context, Montessori offers education as a means to peace.
Contrary to much contemporary &ldquo;peace education&rdquo;, however,
which is often &ldquo;content-oriented&rdquo; (Moretti 2021: 5), she
argues that a system of education within which children are able to
work together freely is the only way to promote a <em>lasting</em>
human peace.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Achieving peace was a twofold process: first, the child would be
called to develop an internal peace, a harmony with the environment,
and a moral sense to guide her acts. Competition, injustice, and abuse
of power found no place in a Montessori classroom. Thanks to an
innovative pedagogy, the child would grow in response to her own
bodily and intellectual needs, fulfilling her own potential. Second,
having developed into a satisfied adult, she would be gratified by her
own work and would be able to find a place within the larger ecology
of the world. The resulting adult would have a natural propensity
toward peace; she would find joy in her work and in her relationships
with people. Montessori&rsquo;s progressive approach would produce
self-determining adults naturally opposed to war. (Moretti 2021:
4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From the start, Montessori&rsquo;s pedagogical approach was oriented
towards avoiding the oppressions and influences that steer children
towards fearful, egotistic, and violent ways of relating towards their
world. In conditions of freedom, and particularly in conditions where
children engage with their environment in accordance with their
guiding instincts, but also where ordinary social problems arise
amongst those free children, the character, respect, and solidarity
that naturally arise create a solid foundation on which peaceful
cooperation among adults can become a reality. Just as Montessorian
classrooms are spaces wherein conflict does not help children freely
work on materials that satisfy their needs, so too the world is a
place within which conflict does not reward the victors. What
Montessori identified as necessary was not didactic exhortations or
instruction related to peace, but the creation of prepared
environments wherein peaceful freedom became a lived reality
incorporated into the psyches of future adults.</p>

<p>
Beyond that pedagogical project, Montessori also advocated for
specific humanitarian and political changes, primarily through
emerging international organizations. Two of the most important such
efforts were the &ldquo;White Cross&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Social Party
of the Child&rdquo;. The inspiration for the White Cross came from
Montessori&rsquo;s efforts, especially during the First World War, to
provide safe educational environments for child victims of war. She
worked closely with American philanthropist and educator Mary Rebecca
Cromwell, who set up Montessori-inspired schools for refugees from
Belgium and northern France. From this work came the idea for the
White Cross.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whereas before World War I she had envisioned educating children to
peace through a prepared environment and scientifically trained
teachers, she now observed the traumatizing effects of war and
realized that her approach&mdash;and even education <em>per
se</em>&mdash;was not enough. The war had such a profound and
long-lasting impact on the child&rsquo;s psyche that new practices
were needed in order to restore his mental and physical capacity and
bring him back to being a collaborative individual, able to live
harmoniously within society. (Moretti 2021: 70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The fundamental idea was to create an organization that would meet the
spiritual and intellectual needs of victims of war, especially
children, in much the way that the Red Cross worked to meet their
physical, medical needs. (White in this context refers to the color of
the nerves, in contrast to the red color of blood.)</p>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="#Fem">&sect;6</a>,
 Montessori&rsquo;s feminist attention to the paternalistic treatment
and denial of rights of women made her attuned to similar violations
of children&rsquo;s dignity. Just as she fought for women&rsquo;s
suffrage early in her life, so later she advocated the creation of a
&ldquo;Ministry of the Child&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Social Party of the
Child&rdquo;, going so far as to refer to the need for &ldquo;a second
French Revolution aimed at promoting the rights of children&rdquo;
(Moretti 2021: 173). Montessori went as far as &ldquo;drafting the
statutes of the Social Party of the Child&rdquo;, in which she argued
that &ldquo;far from needing to be sheltered from the ills of the
adult world, children should in fact take an active role in political
and civic debates&rdquo; (Moretti 2021: 174&ndash;5), and she
established the Social Party of the Child as an independent
organization to &ldquo;ensure the moral, social and economical rights
of all that part of humanity which is in the process of
development&rdquo; (Montessori, October 1937 AMI circular letter,
available through the AMI archives in Amsterdam).</p>

<p>
Consistent with her pedagogical emphasis on freedom and a
philosophical approach that sought to learn <em>from</em> children,
these organizations would serve to create contexts within which
children were personally empowered: having control over their own
actions within the safe environments of the White Cross or having the
power to effect political change through the Social Party of the
Child.</p>

<h2 id="ResMon">8. Responses to Montessori</h2>

<p>
Early response(s) to Montessori&rsquo;s work reflect the tumults of
the times in which she lived. On one hand, she was received with
international acclaim during her early career. Her participation in
feminist conferences in Berlin and London was hailed in international
media. Throughout her life, educators around the world sought her
trainings and her insights. She was nominated three times (1949, 1950,
1951) for the Nobel Peace Prize (see Moretti 2021: 217). Her works
were and are widely translated and disseminated throughout the
world.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, particularly after the outbreak of the First World
War and then with the rising prominence of Dewey in the United States
and other progressive educators in Europe, not to mention the
widespread adoption of so-called &ldquo;factory&rdquo; or
&ldquo;banking&rdquo; models of education in the U.S. and U.K. and
fascist suppression of liberatory education in Germany and also (after
initial support) in Italy, Montessori&rsquo;s thought as educator,
scientist, and philosopher was increasingly marginalized over the
course of the twentieth century. Her choice to leave the university
and focus practitioners informed by her philosophy played some role in
this marginalization, but we should not underestimate the role of her
sex, nationality, and advocacy on behalf of children. Freud, an
Austrian man who built a movement around analysis of adults, had
little trouble gaining academic attention even from outside the
academy. Montessori, an Italian woman focusing her energy on the
insights disclosed by children, was rapidly sidelined. Thus, recent
responses to Montessori are relatively few. Most philosophers of
education treat her as a marginal member of a line of progressive
pedagogues from Rousseau through Freire or bell hooks. Particularly
among Anglophone philosophers, Dewey rather than Montessori is
emblematic of early twentieth-century progressive education. In other
fields of philosophy, she has been virtually ignored, for many of the
reasons other women have been marginalized in the history of
philosophy (see Shapiro 2016).</p>

<p>
Christine Quarfood (2022) has detailed how various European
philosophers and educators, particularly in Italy before and during
the rise of Mussolini, responded to Montessori&rsquo;s ideas. She
highlights the vibrant debate during the fascist years about whether
or not Montessori&rsquo;s pedagogical and especially philosophical
ideas were compatible with fascism, ultimately ending with the
dismissal of Montessori from Italy after her speeches on peace became
known to Mussolini. However, the rest of this section briefly focuses
on the two most important early critiques of Montessori from
U.S.-based philosophers of education:
 <a href="../dewey/">John Dewey</a>
 (1859&ndash;1952) and William Heard Kilpatrick (1871&ndash;1965).</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s criticism is straightforward. In <em>Democracy and
Education</em>, he says of Montessori,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Even the kindergarten and Montessori techniques are so anxious to get
at intellectual distinctions, without &ldquo;waste of time,&rdquo;
that they tend to ignore&mdash;or reduce&mdash;the immediate crude
handling of the familiar material of experience, and to introduce
pupils at once to material which expresses the intellectual
distinctions which adults have made. But the first state of contact
with any new material, at whatever age of maturity, must inevitably be
of the trial and error sort. An individual must actually try, in play
or work, to do something with material in carrying out his own
impulsive activity, and then note the interaction of his energy and
that of the material employed. This is what happens when a child at
first begins to build with blocks, and it is equally what happens when
a scientific man in his laboratory beings to experiment with
unfamiliar objects. (1916: 180&ndash;81)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dewey offers this critique in the context of a broader description of
educational approaches whose &ldquo;fundamental fallacy&rdquo; is
&ldquo;in supposing that experience on the part of pupils may be
assumed&rdquo; (1916: 180). In Montessori&rsquo;s case, the supposed
assumption is not warranted, but the underlying critique aptly gets at
a fundamental distinction between Dewey&rsquo;s and Montessori&rsquo;s
methods, one Dewey reiterates later in terms of what he identifies as
an &ldquo;unconscious suspicion of native experience and consequent
overdoing of external control&rdquo; that are &ldquo;shown&hellip;in
the material supplied&hellip;[in the] Montessori house of
childhood&rdquo; (Dewey 1916: 232).</p>

<p>
It was noted in
 <a href="#PhiEdu">&sect;2</a>
 that one of Montessori&rsquo;s fundamental pedagogical principles is
the prepared environment. Based on observations of children,
Montessori found that children preferred materials with clear and
discrete order and what she came to call &ldquo;control of
error&rdquo; (1:224) whereby materials themselves offer a means for
self-correction. (For an intuitive albeit non-Montessori example,
consider how a jigsaw puzzle that is not assembled correctly will
reveal its error because it does not resemble the picture on the box
cover.) For Montessori, promoting the freedom of children requires
attending to what materials enable children to engage in sustained,
self-directed attention, and then carefully constructing environments
filled with those materials. For Dewey, this preparation of
environment constitutes a &ldquo;fear of raw material&rdquo; and
excessive adult control over children&rsquo;s choices; &ldquo;external
control&rdquo; takes place &ldquo;as much in the material&hellip;as
in&hellip;the teacher&rsquo;s orders&rdquo; (1916: 232). Instead,
Dewey sought to give children freedom in natural and ordinary
environments, a freedom involving more open-ended exploration and
creative response to their environment.</p>

<p>
William Heard Kilpatrick (1871&ndash;1965) was a prot&eacute;g&eacute;
of Dewey&rsquo;s and a leading voice in American progressive education
for the first half of the twentieth century. In 1914, as enthusiasm
for Montessori&rsquo;s method was taking off in the United States,
Kilpatrick published <em>The Montessori System Examined</em> (1914).
He aimed his book, not towards &ldquo;heroic enthusiasts that
become&hellip;partisan leaders and followers of a new
propaganda&rdquo;, but at &ldquo;the leaders and teachers of the rank
and file&rdquo; who &ldquo;want to know how far the theory of Madam
Montessori departs from the best philosophy that the American
profession knows&rdquo; (1914: ix). Kilpatrick&rsquo;s assessment is
that Montessori&rsquo;s philosophy is partly old news, partly outdated
errors, with one possible (but not yet tested to his satisfaction)
concrete contribution. He praises Montessori&rsquo;s &ldquo;doctrine
of liberty&rdquo;, which is valuable, albeit only&mdash;like her
lessons on practical life&mdash;as &ldquo;corroboration of a doctrine
long and widely preached, but too often disregarded&rdquo; (1914: 26,
40). One possible new contribution is Montessori&rsquo;s
&ldquo;technique of writing&rdquo; (1914: 67). Whereas he dismisses
much of her success with teaching young children to read and write as
being due to the relative ease of the Italian language (1914:
53&ndash;5), her approach to teaching writing through isolating the
relevant bodily motions and then combining them into writing is a
proposal that &ldquo;experimentation only can decide&rdquo; (1914:
58).</p>

<p>
Kilpatrick offers many criticisms, but the two most important are
these:</p>

<p>
First, Kilpatrick objects that Montessori &ldquo;does not provide
situations for more adequate social cooperation&rdquo; (1914: 20).
Kilpatrick&rsquo;s opposition may be based on his emphasis on
&ldquo;shared responsibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;collective
democra[cy]&rdquo;, in contrast to what Kilpatrick perceived as a
&ldquo;individualistic, almost anti-social Montessori approach&rdquo;
(Simons 1988: 341). As we have seen
 (<a href="#EcoHol">&sect;3.2</a>,
 <a href="#ChaResSol">&sect;5.2</a>,
 <a href="#PeaEduRigChi">&sect;7</a>),
 Montessori strongly affirms the value of social solidarity, human
interconnectedness (with each other and the broader ecosystem), and
cooperation; but especially in her early writings, she emphasized the
importance of mutual respect for individual liberty and individual
work. Her classrooms promote social and moral development, but
Kilpatrick rightly notes that <em>cooperation</em> per se is secondary
to mutual respect and the possibility of independent work.</p>

<p>
Second, consistent with Dewey&rsquo;s central critique, Kilpatrick
objects to the artificiality and especially rigidity of Montessori
materials: &ldquo;The didactic apparatus which forms the principal
means of activity in the Montessori school affords singularly little
variety&rdquo; and thus &ldquo;affords but meager diet for normally
active children&rdquo; (1914: 27&ndash;8). Instead of such material,
we should offer &ldquo;life itself and the situations that arise
therefrom&rdquo; (1914: 34).</p>

<p>
In the end, he says, &ldquo;in the content of her doctrine, she
belongs essentially to the mid-nineteenth century, some fifty years
behind the present development of educational theory&rdquo; and
&ldquo;if we compare the work of Madame Montessori with that
of&hellip;Professor Dewey&rdquo;, we find that Dewey&rsquo;s ideas</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
include all that is valid in [her] doctrines&hellip;, afford the
criteria for correcting her errors&hellip;and&hellip;go vastly farther
in the construction of an educational method. (1914: 63, 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kilpatrick was influential within the U.S. educational establishment
and helped push Montessori&rsquo;s method out of the spotlight. While
there was a significant revival of interest in Montessori with the
founding of the American Montessori Society by Nancy Rambusch in 1960,
Montessori has still not been incorporated into mainstream educational
theory in the U.S. With Kilpatrick&rsquo;s critique of Montessori,
&ldquo;For the first time in modern history of American public
education, a genuine lay enthusiasm had been engendered but died in
the face of professional opposition&rdquo; (Beck 1960: 162).</p>

<h2 id="MonInfRel">9. Montessori&rsquo;s Influence and Relevance</h2>

<p>
Montessori&rsquo;s most significant impacts over the past hundred
years have been the tens of thousands of schools throughout the world
in which children develop in classrooms overseen by teachers trained
in her pedagogical philosophy, methods, and materials. In addition,
many of Montessori&rsquo;s ideas about children and
childhood&mdash;such as &ldquo;sensitive periods&rdquo; in child
development, the need for environments designed and sized for
children, children&rsquo;s rights, and freedom in education&mdash;have
all become widespread. Some of Montessori&rsquo;s most important
political ideals, such as her advocacy for a Social Party of the Child
or a White Cross that would deal with psychological trauma in wartime,
have yet to materialize. But her overall role in making the twentieth
century the &ldquo;Century of the Child&rdquo; (see Key 1909) was
substantial and lasting.</p>

<p>
Her pedagogical work gave rise to several national and international
organizations that continue her legacy in both theory and practice.
The Association Montessori Internationale (AMI), which was established
by Montessori in 1929 and is currently headquartered in Amsterdam,
maintains a publication&mdash;<em>The AMI Journal</em>&mdash;and
archives and works with the Montessori-Pierson Publishing Company (a
publishing company established by Montessori&rsquo;s heirs) to put out
editions of Montessori&rsquo;s works and lectures in multiple
languages, sometimes in collaboration with other publishers. The
American Montessori Society (AMS) is the largest professional
association of Montessorians in the United States and has its own
trade publication&mdash;<em>Montessori Life</em>&mdash;and sponsors an
academic journal: <em>The Journal of Montessori Research</em>. Other
Montessori-related organizations abound, many with their own
publications. Increasingly, Montessorians have sought to bring
Montessori&rsquo;s ideas into richer conversation with other
educational, psychological, and philosophical ideas. Within
psychology, Angeline Lillard&rsquo;s research program examines
Montessori in the light of contemporary psychology (see Lillard 2005
and subsequent editions and links at
 <a href="https://www.montessori-science.org/">Montessori-Science.org</a>).
 <em>The Bloomsbury Montessori Handbook</em> (Murray et al. 2023)
pulls together recent research on Montessori from a variety of fields
(including philosophy).</p>

<p>
Among philosophers, Montessori has been largely neglected, though
there are some signs of new interest in applying her work to ongoing
philosophical problems not only in the philosophy of education but
also, as this entry has shown, to a wide range of philosophical
issues. Andrew Colgan&rsquo;s work (2016) shows the relevance of her
epistemology for her philosophy of education. Patrick Frierson has
shown how she speaks to current issues in virtue epistemology (2018;
2020), moral philosophy (2021b; 2022), technology studies (2024), and
other fields (forthcoming). Laura Di Paolo shows the anticipation of
embodied/enactive/extended mind in Montessori work, and the ongoing
relevance of that work for a range of issues in the philosophy of mind
(Di Paolo et al. 2024). Erica Moretti&rsquo;s work on the central role
of peace in Montessori not only provides a new historical perspective
on Montessori but opens room for developing Montessorian alternatives
to contemporary approaches to peace studies and peace education
(2021), and Nicholas Parkin draws on Montessori to defend what he
calls &ldquo;educational pacificism&rdquo; (2024). De Giorgi has done
historical work on Montessori&rsquo;s religious works (see especially
2013; 2018; 2019), while Natalie Carnes&rsquo;s excellent article on
Montessori&rsquo;s &ldquo;theological anthropology&rdquo; shows how
Montessori&rsquo;s approach to children provides new ways of thinking
about oppression, the human condition, original sin, and other
important topics in a feminist-liberationist theological context
(2015). Like other marginalized figures in the history of philosophy,
Montessori&rsquo;s contemporary relevance outstrips her influence, and
research on her philosophical contributions is still in its
infancy.</p>
