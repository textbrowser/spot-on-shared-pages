<h1>Intensional Transitive Verbs</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Nov 3, 2004; substantive revision Thu May 29, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
A verb is <em>transitive</em> only if it can occur with a direct
object, and in such occurrences it is said to <em>occur
transitively</em>. Thus &lsquo;ate&rsquo; and &lsquo;left&rsquo; occur
transitively in &lsquo;I ate the meat and left the vegetables&rsquo;,
but not in &lsquo;I ate then left&rsquo; (perhaps it is not the same
verb &lsquo;left&rsquo; in these two examples, but it seems to be the
same &lsquo;ate&rsquo;). A verb is <em>intensional</em> if the verb
phrase (VP) it forms with its complement is anomalous in at least one
of three ways: (i) in the complement of the verb, substituting one
expression for another that is coreferential with it can change the
truth-value of the sentence in which the VP occurs &ndash; for
instance, you might admire Mark Twain but not Samuel Clemens, unaware
that your pesky neighbor Sam <em>is</em> the famous writer (in this
case substitution of the coreferential &lsquo;Samuel Clemens&rsquo;
for &lsquo;Mark Twain&rsquo; in the VP &lsquo;admire Mark Twain&rsquo;
will turn a true sentence, &lsquo;you admire Mark Twain&rsquo;, into a
false one, &lsquo;you admire Samuel Clemens&rsquo;); (ii) the VP
admits of a special &ldquo;unspecific&rdquo; reading if it contains a
quantifier, or a certain type of quantifier (Quine&rsquo;s example
(1956, 185) is famous: he observes that if we paraphrase &lsquo;I want
a sloop&rsquo; as &lsquo;there is a sloop such that I want it&rsquo;,
this will give the wrong idea if all I want is &lsquo;mere relief from
slooplessness&rsquo;, a sloop but no specific one; for more examples,
see section 1); and (iii) the normal existential commitments of names
and existential quantifiers in the complement are suspended even when
the embedding sentence is negation-free (again, see section 1).
Zimmerman (2001, 516&ndash;20) discusses relationships among these
three marks of intensionality.</p>

<p>
Intensional phenomena are puzzling, and worth studying, because (a) it
seems that the only way to account for language-speakers&rsquo;
capacities to produce and understand sentences of their native
languages which they have never produced or encountered before is to
posit
 <a href="../compositionality/">compositional structure</a>
 in language along with a productive and interpretive capacity in
speakers that exploits it. But (b) the simplest ideas about what such
structure is like cannot accommodate intensionality. So we want to
know what the smallest complication is which allows for the
intensional. Investigation of intensional verbs has focussed mainly on
verbs used to make
 <a href="../prop-attitude-reports/">propositional attitude reports</a>.
 These verbs take clauses rather than direct objects as their
syntactic complements. However, as we will see below, intensional
transitive verbs (henceforth ITVs) do not merely duplicate the
problems raised by propositional attitude verbs, but introduce special
difficulties of their own.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="SomeGrouITVsTheiBeha">1. Some groups of ITV&rsquo;s and their behavior</h2>

<p>
Search verbs and desire verbs manifest all three of the behaviors
listed in the prologue as &ldquo;marks&rdquo; or characteristic
effects of intensionality. For example, Lois Lane may be seeking
Superman, but it does not seem to follow that she is seeking Clark,
even though Superman is Clark. So we have an example of the first kind
of anomaly mentioned in the prologue: substitution of one name with
another for the same person leads to a change in truth-value for the
embedding sentence (here &ldquo;Lois is seeking Superman&rdquo;).
Similarly, a thirsty person who believes that water quenches thirst
and that H<sub>2</sub>O is a kind of rat poison may want some water
but not some H<sub>2</sub>O. [According to some, this alleged failure
of substitution to preserve truth-value is an illusion (the <em>locus
classicus</em> of the view is Salmon 1986); but this would simply
reduce the three marks to two for some cases, so I will not focus on
it.]</p>

<p>
Second, search verbs and desire verbs both create specific-unspecific
ambiguities in their containing VPs when the syntactic object of the
verb consists in a determiner followed by a nominal (this ambiguity is
also known as the relational/notional ambiguity, following Quine 1956,
where it was first studied in the modern period). For example,
&lsquo;Oedipus is seeking a member of his family&rsquo; could be true
because Oedipus is seeking specifically Jocasta, who is a member of
his family, though he doesn&rsquo;t realize it. On such an occasion,
what is true can be more carefully stated as &lsquo;there is a member
of his family such that Oedipus is seeking that person&rsquo;. The
alternative, unspecific or notional reading, is forced by adding
&lsquo;but no particular one&rsquo;: &lsquo;Oedipus is seeking a
member of his family, but no particular one&rsquo;. Here Oedipus is
implied just to have a general intention to find some member or other
of his family (who perhaps meets other conditions &ndash; young,
female, and so on). Contrast the extensional &lsquo;embrace&rsquo;:
Oedipus cannot embrace a member of his family, but no particular
one.</p>

<p>
Third, it is obvious that it is possible both to want, and to search
for, that which does not exist, for instance, a fountain of eternal
youth. But it isn&rsquo;t possible to, say, stumble across such a
thing, unless it exists.</p>

<p>
Depiction verbs, such as &lsquo;draw&rsquo;, &lsquo;sculpt&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;imagine&rsquo;, resist substitution in their syntactic objects,
at least if the clausal &lsquo;imagine&rsquo; does, for it is hard to
see how a difference between imagining that Superman rescues you and
imagining that Clark rescues you could arise if imagining Superman is
the same thing as imagining Clark. A specific/unspecific ambiguity is
also possible, as is attested by the wall label for Guercino&rsquo;s
<em>The Aldrovandi Dog</em> (ca. 1625) in the Norton Simon Museum,
which states &lsquo;this must be the portrait of a specific
dog&rsquo;, thereby implicating the existence of an alternative, that
&lsquo;Guercino drew a dog&rsquo; <em>could</em> be taken to mean that
he drew a dog, but no particular dog &mdash; he just made one up. And
we can clearly draw or imagine that which does not exist (as opposed
to, say, photographing it). Braque&rsquo;s <em>Little Harbor in
Normandy</em> (1909) is an example, according to the curators of the
Art Institute of Chicago: the wall-label says &lsquo;it appears this
work was painted from imagination, since the landscape depicted cannot
be identified.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
However, whether or not a notional reading of a depiction VP is
possible depends on which quantificational determiner occurs in the
noun phrase complement. If we say &lsquo;Guercino drew every
dog&rsquo;, &lsquo;Guercino drew most dogs&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Guercino
drew the dog&rsquo; (non-anaphoric &lsquo;the dog&rsquo;), we seem to
advert to some antecedent domain with respect to which &lsquo;drew
every/most/the dog(s)&rsquo; are to be evaluated. So specific readings
are
 required.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 This resistance of some depiction VP&rsquo;s to unspecific construal
is robust across languages and is typical of those quantificational
determiners which do not occur naturally in existential contexts such
as non-demonstrative &lsquo;there is&rsquo;: contrast &lsquo;there is
a dog in the garden&rsquo; with &lsquo;there is every dog in the
garden&rsquo;, &lsquo;there are most dogs in the garden&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;there is the dog in the garden&rsquo;. An account of what is
wrong with &lsquo;there is every dog in the garden&rsquo;, such as
that in Keenan 2003, might well contain the materials for explaining
the lack of unspecific readings of depiction VPs with determiners like
&lsquo;every&rsquo;, &lsquo;most&rsquo; and &lsquo;the&rsquo;; see
further Forbes (2006, 142&ndash;150).</p>

<p>
It should be emphasized that depiction verbs are special in this
respect, for there is no problem getting unspecific readings in
English with &lsquo;every&rsquo;, &lsquo;most&rsquo; and
&lsquo;the&rsquo; using desire verbs or search verbs. Guercino might
be looking for every dog Aldrovandi owns to see which one would make
the best subject for the portrait that the Count has commissioned
(&lsquo;paint a picture of one of my dogs for me&rsquo;); in this case
there are no particular dogs he is looking for. The police might be
looking for everyone who witnessed the incident, though they have no
idea who or how many those people are (a specific reading is also
possible, since perhaps the four men A, B, C and D are all the people
who witnessed the incident, and the police seek each individually for
unrelated reasons: each of A, B, C and D is such that the police are
looking for him, and so they are, as it turns out, looking for
everyone who witnessed the incident, whether or not they know that A,
B, C and D are those witnesses). The reader might be driving around an
unfamiliar airport rental car lot, looking for the exit, and in this
case there is no exit such that <em>it</em> is being sought.
(&lsquo;Look&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t really a transitive verb, but when the
following preposition is &lsquo;for&rsquo;, a search activity is
denoted, so it is customary to count the likes of &lsquo;looking
for&rsquo; as a &ldquo;transitive verb&rdquo; in contexts where
intensionality is under discussion.)</p>

<p>
Mixed behavior is also manifested by evaluative verbs, for example
&lsquo;respect&rsquo;, &lsquo;admire&rsquo;, &lsquo;disdain&rsquo; and
&lsquo;worship&rsquo;. Lex Luthor might fear Superman, but not Clark,
and Lois might disdain Clark, but not Superman. However, unspecific
readings of VPs with quantified complements are harder to hear, at
least when the quantifier is existential. &lsquo;Lois admires an
extraterrestrial&rsquo; can easily be heard in two ways: there is the
&lsquo;admires a particular extraterrestrial&rsquo; reading, and there
is a <em>generic</em> reading, which means that among the kinds of
thing she admires are extraterrestrials in general. Generic readings
of evaluative VPs attribute dispositions, and are not the same as
unspecific or notional readings (see Cohen 1999, 2008, and the entry
on
 <a href="../generics/">generics</a>).
 There does not seem to be a sensible non-generic construal of
&lsquo;Lois admires an extraterrestrial, but no particular one&rsquo;.
However, there is some question about other verbs, especially
&lsquo;fear&rsquo;. Den Dikken et al. point to examples like
&lsquo;Max fears an error in his proof&rsquo;, where there is no
specific error that is feared, yet the non-specific reading
isn&rsquo;t generic (2018, 84 n.40). But perhaps &lsquo;fear&rsquo; in
this example is simply masquerading as transitive, the words
&lsquo;that there is&rsquo; having been elided.</p>

<p>
The verb &lsquo;need&rsquo; is an interesting case. A sports team
might need a better coach, though no specific better coach, and might
need a better coach even if there are none to be had. So two out of
three marks of intensionality are present. However, &lsquo;need&rsquo;
contrasts with &lsquo;want&rsquo; as regards substitution: our
dehydrated subject who does not want H<sub>2</sub>O because he
believes it to be a kind of rat poison, nevertheless <em>needs</em>
H<sub>2</sub>O, regardless of his beliefs about it. It seems that
co-denoting terms may be interchanged in the complement of
&lsquo;need&rsquo; (and also of &lsquo;require&rsquo;). But merely
accidentally co-extensive ones cannot be: Larson (2001, 232) gives the
example of Max the theater impresario, who needs more singers but not
more dancers, even if all who sing dance, and vice-versa. The property
<em>singer</em> and the property <em>dancer</em> are different
properties, so expressions for them cannot be exchanged in the
complement of &lsquo;need&rsquo;. Similar restricted substitutivity is
observed with transaction verbs such as &lsquo;wager&rsquo;,
&lsquo;owe&rsquo;, &lsquo;buy&rsquo;, &lsquo;sell&rsquo;,
&lsquo;reserve&rsquo;, and perhaps the transaction resultative
&lsquo;own&rsquo;. One may reserve a table at a restaurant, though
there need not be a specific table one has reserved in making the
reservation, since the restaurant may be expecting a slow night. But
these verbs do allow interchange of co-referential expressions (a
purchase of water-rights is a purchase of H<sub>2</sub>O-rights)
though not of accidentally co-extensive ones (Zimmerman 1993, 151) .
For &lsquo;own&rsquo; see (Zimmerman 2001, <em>passim</em>).</p>

<p>
Indeed, it is even arguable that some marks of intensionality are
present with verbs that do allow interchange of accidentally
co-extensive expressions. A case in point is verbs of absence, such as
&lsquo;omit&rsquo; and &lsquo;lack&rsquo;. If it so happens that all
and only the physicists on the faculty are the faculty&rsquo;s
Nobel-prize winners, then a faculty committee that lacks a physicist
must, it seems, lack a Nobel-prize winner, if no particular one.
However, not too much weight can be put on this case, since it may be
that at some level, &lsquo;lack&rsquo; should be analyzed (possibly in
a complicated way) in terms of <em>not having</em>, and
&lsquo;omit&rsquo; in terms of not including, in which case they would
not really be intensional verbs at all; though so far as the author
knows, no convincing analysis of this type has been formulated. One
objection to any equivalence is pursued in Moltmann 2024. Moltmann
points out that &lsquo;lack&rsquo; statements can carry prescriptive
implications that &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have&rdquo; counterparts
don&rsquo;t carry. If someone asks for a ride home, you may say
&ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t have a car&rdquo; but it would be odd to
say &lsquo;I lack a car&rsquo;, which seems to suggest that you
<em>should</em> have one. To explain this and other cases, Moltmann
gives a truth-maker analysis of &lsquo;lack&rsquo;-ascriptions on
which they involve adverting to a conception C of a complete whole,
and imply that the thing to which the ascription of lack is being made
fails to match up to C. For this reason, lacking a physicist would
only imply <em>not having</em> (as opposed to lacking) a Nobel
prize-winner: there may well be good reason why the committee in
question should have a physicist on it, without there being any reason
why it should have a Nobel-prize winner.</p>

<h2 id="HowManyMechForHowManyMark">2. How many mechanisms for how many marks?</h2>

<p>
We have distinguished three &ldquo;marks&rdquo; or effects of
intensionality: substitution-resistance, the availability of
unspecific readings, and existence-neutrality. A natural question is
whether one and the same semantic mechanism underlies all three
effects, whether they are entirely independent, or whether two have a
common source distinct from the third&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
In the context of a discussion of propositional attitude verbs, that
is, verbs which take clausal or clause-embedding noun-phrase
complements rather than simple noun-phrase (NP) objects, one
hypothesis which keeps explanatory apparatus to the minimum is that
all three effects of intensionality arise from the possibility of the
complement having <em>narrow scope</em> with respect to the attitude
verb. Thus we might distinguish two readings of</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>Lex Luthor fears that Superman is nearby,</dd>
</dl>

<p>
namely</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(2a)</dt>
<dd>Lex Luthor fears-true the proposition that Superman is
 nearby<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
and</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(2b)</dt>
<dd>Superman is someone such that Lex Luthor fears(-true the
proposition) that he is nearby.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In (2a) we make the clause &lsquo;that Superman is nearby&rsquo; the
complement of &lsquo;proposition&rsquo; to guarantee that
&lsquo;Superman&rsquo; is within the scope of &lsquo;fears&rsquo; (the
resulting NP &lsquo;the proposition&hellip;&rsquo; is a &ldquo;scope
island&rdquo;). And in (2b) we use a form of words that encourages an
audience to process &lsquo;Superman&rsquo; ahead of
&lsquo;fears&rsquo;. We can associate substitution-resistance with
(2a), while allowing substitution in (2b). (2b) ascribes a complex
property to Superman, and therefore also to Clark; namely, <em>being
someone who Lex fears is nearby</em>. (2a), on the other hand, puts
Lex in the fearing-true attitude relation to a certain proposition,
with essentially no logical implications about what other propositions
he may fear-true. So, provided the proposition that Superman is nearby
is distinct from the proposition that Clark Kent is nearby,
substitution-failure in (1) construed as (2a) is explicable.</p>

<p>
As for taking these two propositions to be distinct, there are many
familiar accounts, mostly involving some variation of the original
proposal in modern philosophical semantics, found in Frege 1892.
According to Frege, every meaningful expression or phrase has both a
<em>customary reference</em> that it <em>denotes</em>, and a
<em>customary sense</em> that it <em>expresses</em>. In the case of
clauses, the customary reference would be a truth-value which is
compositionally derived from the denotations of the words of the
clause, and the customary sense would be a way of thinking of that
truth-value, compositionally derived from the senses of the words of
the clause. Therefore, provided that &lsquo;Superman&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Clark Kent&rsquo; have different though coreferential senses,
i.e., provided they express different ways of thinking of the same
individual, we will get different propositions. However, it&rsquo;s
highly non-trivial to find an adequate account of the senses of names,
given the critique in Kripke 1972 of standard accounts and certain
variations on them.</p>

<p>
But on the face of it, this distinction between sense and reference
only has (1), intended in the (2a) manner, <em>expressing a different
proposition</em> from</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(2c)</dt>
<dd>Lex Luthor fears that Clark is nearby.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Since truth-value is on the level of reference, and the corresponding
words of (2a) and (2c) all have the same referents, the resulting
truth-values for (2a) and (2c) will be the same; but they are supposed
to be different. So Frege makes the ingenious suggestion that it is an
effect of embedding in intensional contexts (he only considered
clausal verbs) that expressions in such contexts no longer denote
their customary references, but rather their customary senses. Then
(1) intended as (2a) is true iff (&lsquo;if and only if&rsquo;) the
reference of &lsquo;Lex&rsquo; stands in the fearing-true relation to
the <em>switched</em> reference of &lsquo;Superman is nearby&rsquo;,
namely, its customary sense. Now we have our explanation of why merely
interchanging <em>customarily</em> co-referential expressions in (1)
can produce falsehood from a truth: the substitution does not preserve
reference, since the names are now <em>denoting</em> their customary
senses. However, if (1) is intended as (2b), there will be no
truth-value switch, since there is no name-reference switch: in (2b)
&lsquo;Superman&rsquo; is not in the scope of &lsquo;fears&rsquo;,
therefore it denotes its customary reference, the alien Kal-El, and
interchange with any other expression denoting that same referent must
of necessity be truth-value preserving. However, importation of the
substituted name to move from a (2b)-style meaning to a (2a)-one will
of course be fallacious. (Readers in search of more detailed
discussion of Frege&rsquo;s notion of sense might consult the section
on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/index.html#FreLan">Frege&rsquo;s philosophy of language</a>
 in the entry on Frege. See also the entry on
 <a href="../prop-attitude-reports/">propositional attitude reports</a>,
 and for other uses of Frege-style &ldquo;switcher semantics&rdquo;,
Gluer and Pagin 2012.)</p>

<p>
A view like this has the capacity to explain the other intensionality
effects. The specific-unspecific ambiguity in &lsquo;Lex fears that an
extraterrestrial is nearby&rsquo; is explained in terms of scope
ambiguity, the notional or unspecific reading corresponding to</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(3a)</dt>
<dd>Lex fears-true the proposition that an extraterrestrial is
nearby</dd>
</dl>

<p>
and the relational or specific reading to</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(3b)</dt>
<dd>An extraterrestrial is such that Lex fears that it is nearby.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Existence-neutrality is also explained, since the
<em>proposition</em>, that an extraterrestrial is nearby, is available
for its truth to be feared, believed, suspected or doubted, whether or
not there are extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>
There are other accounts of substitution failure, but details are
incidental at this point. For there are real issues about (A) whether
a single mechanism <em>could</em> be responsible for all three
effects, and (B) whether an account of any effect in terms of a scope
mechanism is workable for transitive, as opposed to clausal,
verbs.</p>

<p>
(A) The behaviors cited in the previous section suggest that
substitution-resistance and the availability of an unspecific reading
have different explanations. For we saw that the verb
&lsquo;need&rsquo; contrasts with the verb &lsquo;want&rsquo; as
regards substitution-resistance, but is similar as regards the
availability of unspecific readings of embedding VPs. So it seems that
there is a mechanism that blocks substitution, perhaps the Fregean
reference-switch one, perhaps something else more compatible with what
Davidson calls &ldquo;semantic innocence&rdquo; (Davidson 1969,
172&mdash;a semantically innocent account of substitution-failure is
one that does not alter the semantics of the substitution-resisting
expressions themselves for the special case in which they occur in
intensional contexts). And this mechanism cannot occur with
&lsquo;need&rsquo;, but can with &lsquo;want&rsquo; (&lsquo;can&rsquo;
rather than &lsquo;does&rsquo; because it is optional; this is to
allow for &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; or substitution-permitting
readings of the likes of &lsquo;Lex fears Superman&rsquo; analogous to
(3b)). On the other hand, whatever explains notional readings is
evidently available to both verbs, and therefore it is not the same
mechanism as underlies the substitution-resistance of
&lsquo;wants&rsquo;. However, this reasoning is not conclusive, since
the substitution-resistance mechanism may be present with
&lsquo;needs&rsquo; but somehow rendered ineffective (see Parsons
1997, 370), though one would want to hear how the ineffectiveness
comes about.</p>

<p>
Some evaluative verbs, for instance, &lsquo;admire&rsquo;, present the
converse challenge: substitution-resistance but apparently no
unspecific readings of embedding VPs, certainly not existential ones.
It is less clear how a defender of a &lsquo;single explanation&rsquo;
theory would handle this, at least if the single explanation is a
scope mechanism, since it appears from other cases that occurrence of
an existential genuinely within the scope of the intensional verb
immediately produces an unspecific reading.</p>

<p>
Suspension of existential commitment may group with availability of
unspecific readings for explanatory purposes. There appear to be no
cases of intensional transitives which allow notional readings of
embedded VPs, but where those VPs have the same existential
consequences as ones which differ just by the substitution of an
extensional for the intensional verb. For instance, you might be
looking for an extraterrestrial to prove such things exist, but that
you are looking for one doesn&rsquo;t entail their existence, whereas
if you have <em>found</em> one, then such things exist. So switching
from the intensional search verb to the extensional success verb
changed existential consequences.</p>

<p>
(B) The scope account is the only real contender for a single
explanation of the intensionality effects. But there is a major
question about whether it can be transferred at all from clausal to
transitive verbs. For the intensionality effects would all be
associated with narrow-scope occurrences of noun phrases (NPs), and
with a transitive verb such syntactic configuration is problematic
when the NP is quantified. This is because, in standard first-order
syntax, a quantifier must have a sentence within its scope (an open
sentence that has a free variable which the NP binds, if redundant
quantification is ruled out in the syntax). We can provide this for
relational or wide-scope readings, for example</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(4)</dt>
<dd>An extraterrestrial is such that Lois is looking for it</dd>
</dl>

<p>
in which &lsquo;Lois is looking for it&rsquo; is the scope of
&lsquo;an extraterrestrial&rsquo; and the latter binds
&lsquo;it&rsquo;. But if &lsquo;an extraterrestrial&rsquo; is supposed
to be within the scope of &lsquo;looking for&rsquo; there is no clause
to be <em>its</em> scope; it has to be an argument of the relation,
which is not allowed in first-order language. As Kaplan says,
&lsquo;without an inner sentential context&hellip;distinctions of
scope disappear&rsquo; (Kaplan 1986, 266). Of course, readers who have
taught symbolic logic will be very familiar with the student who,
having symbolized &lsquo;Jack hit Bill&rsquo; as &lsquo;Hjb&rsquo;,
then offers something like &lsquo;Hj(&exist;<em>x</em>)&rsquo; as the
symbolization of &lsquo;Jack hit someone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
The description of the problem suggests two forms of solution. One is
to preserve first-order syntax by uncovering hidden material to be the
scope of a quantified NP even when the latter is within the scope of
the intensional verb. The other is to drop first-order syntax in favor
of a formalism which permits the meanings of quantified NPs to be
arguments of intensional relations such as fearing and seeking. We
consider these options in turn in the following two sections.</p>

<h2 id="Prop">3. Propositionalism</h2>

<p>
The idea of uncovering hidden material to provide NPs in notional
readings of intensional VPs with sentential scope was prominently
endorsed in Quine 1956, where the proposal is to paraphrase search
verbs with &lsquo;endeavor to find&rsquo;. So for (5a) we would have
(5b):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(5a)</dt>
<dd>Lois is looking for an extraterrestrial</dd>
<dt>(5b)</dt>
<dd>Lois is endeavoring to find an extraterrestrial</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Partee (1974, 97) objects that this cannot be the whole story, since
search verbs are not all synonyms (&lsquo;groping for&rsquo;
doesn&rsquo;t mean exactly the same as &lsquo;rummaging about
for&rsquo;), but den Dikken, Larson, &amp; Ludlow (1996) and Parsons
(1997, 381) suggest that the search verb itself be used in place of
&lsquo;endeavor&rsquo;. So we get</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(6a)</dt>
<dd>Lois is looking to find an extraterrestrial</dd>
</dl>

<p>
or in somewhat non-Quinean lingo,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(6b)</dt>
<dd>Lois is looking in order to make true the proposition that an
extraterrestrial is such that she herself finds
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
Here &lsquo;an extraterrestrial&rsquo; is both within the scope of
&lsquo;looking&rsquo; and has the open sentence &lsquo;she herself
finds it&rsquo; as <em>its</em> scope.</p>

<p>
It may or may not be meaning-preserving to replace (5a)&rsquo;s
prepositional phrase with (6a)&rsquo;s purpose clause, but even if it
is meaning-preserving, that is insufficient to show that (6a) or (6b)
articulates the semantics of (5a); it may merely be a cognate.
However, with &lsquo;need&rsquo; and desire verbs, evidence for the
presence of a hidden clause is strong. For example, in</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(7)</dt>
<dd>Physics needs some new computers soon</dd>
</dl>

<p>
it makes little sense to construe &lsquo;soon&rsquo; as modifying
&lsquo;needs&rsquo;; it seems rather to modify a hidden
&lsquo;get&rsquo; or &lsquo;have&rsquo;, as is explicit in
&lsquo;Physics needs to get some new computers soon&rsquo;, i.e.,
&lsquo;Physics needs it to be the case that, for some new computers,
it gets them soon&rsquo;. (This is &lsquo;get&rsquo; in the sense of
&lsquo;receives&rsquo;; for &lsquo;get&rsquo; versus
&lsquo;have&rsquo;, see Harley 2004.)</p>

<p>
Secondly, there is the phenomenon of propositional anaphor (den
Dikken, Larson, &amp; Ludlow 2018, 52&ndash;3), illustrated in</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(8)</dt>
<dd>Physics needs some new computers, but its budget won&rsquo;t allow
it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
What is not allowed is that Physics <em>gets</em> (or for this case,
&lsquo;purchases&rsquo;) some new computers.</p>

<p>
Third, attachment ambiguities suggest there is more than one verb
present for modifiers to attach to (Dikken, Larson, &amp; Ludlow 1996,
332):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(9)</dt>
<dd>Physics will need some new computers next year</dd>
</dl>

<p>
could mean that a need for new computers will arise in the department
next year, but could also mean that next year is when Physics should
<em>get</em> new computers, if its need (which may arise later this
year) is to be met.</p>

<p>
Finally, ellipsis generates similar ambiguities:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(10)</dt>
<dd>Physics will need some new computers before Chemistry</dd>
</dl>

<p>
could mean that the need will arise in Physics before it does in
Chemistry, but could also mean that Physics will need to get some new
computers before Chemistry gets any.</p>

<p>
However, the strength of the case for a hidden &lsquo;get&rsquo; with
&lsquo;need&rsquo; or &lsquo;want&rsquo; contrasts with the case for
propositionalism about search verbs. As observed by Partee (1974, 99),
for the latter there are no attachment ambiguities like those in (9).
For example,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(11)</dt>
<dd>Physics will shop for some new computers next year</dd>
</dl>

<p>
can only mean that the shopping will occur next year. There is no
second reading, corresponding to the other reading of (9), in which
&lsquo;next year&rsquo; attaches to a hidden &lsquo;find/buy&rsquo;.
The phenomena in (8) and (10) also lack parallels with search verbs;
for example, &lsquo;Physics will shop for some new computers before
Chemistry&rsquo; lacks a reading that has Physics shopping with the
following goal: to find/buy new computers before Chemistry finds/buys
any. And although the propositionalist might offer something like</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(12)</dt>
<dd>Physics will seek more office space by noon</dd>
</dl>

<p>
as an analog of (7), it is far from clear that (12) genuinely has a
reading of the &lsquo;seek to find more office space by noon&rsquo;
sort, or whether the hint of such a reading is just an echo of
(7).</p>

<p>
Other intensional transitives, such as depiction verbs and evaluative
verbs, don&rsquo;t have an evident propositional paraphrase in the
first place. However, for psychological depiction verbs such as
&lsquo;fantasize&rsquo; and &lsquo;imagine&rsquo;, Parsons (1997, 376)
proposes what he calls &ldquo;Hamlet ellipsis&rdquo;: &lsquo;Mary
imagined a unicorn&rsquo; would become the clausal &lsquo;Mary
imagined a unicorn to be&rsquo;. Larson (2001, 233) suggests that the
complement is a &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;verbless&rdquo; clause,
and for &lsquo;Max visualizes a unicorn&rsquo; proposes &lsquo;Max
visualizes a unicorn in front of him&rsquo;. This is too specific,
since we can understand &lsquo;Max visualizes a unicorn&rsquo; without
knowing whether he visualizes it in front of him, above him or below
him. But even if we change the paraphrase to &lsquo;Max visualizes a
unicorn spatially related to him&rsquo;, this proposal, as well as
Parsons&rsquo;, has problems with negation: &lsquo;Mary didn&rsquo;t
imagine a unicorn&rsquo; is not synonymous with either &lsquo;Mary
didn&rsquo;t imagine a unicorn to be&rsquo; or with &lsquo;Mary
didn&rsquo;t imagine a unicorn spatially related to her&rsquo;, since
the first of these allows for her to imagine a unicorn but not imagine
it to be, and the second, for her to imagine a unicorn but not as
spatially related to her. There may be philosophical arguments that
exclude these
 options,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 but the very fact that a philosophical argument is needed puts the
proposals above the level of semantics.</p>

<p>
Clausal paraphrases for verbs like &lsquo;fear&rsquo; are even less
likely, since the extra material in the paraphrase can be read as the
focus of the fear, making the paraphrase insufficient. For example,
fearing <em>x</em> is not the same as fearing encountering <em>x</em>,
since it may be the encounter that is feared, say if <em>x</em> is an
unfearsome individual with a dangerous communicable disease. In the
same vein, fearing <em>x</em> is not the same as fearing that
<em>x</em> will hurt you: you may fear that your accident-prone
dentist will hurt you, without fearing the dentist (see further Forbes
2006, 66&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
We conclude that if any single approach to intensional transitives is
to cover all the ground, it will have to be non-propositionalist. But
it is also possible, perhaps likely, that intensional transitives are
not a unitary class, and that propositionalism is correct for some of
these verbs but not for others (see further Schwarz 2006, M. Montague
2007).</p>

<h2 id="MontSema">4. Montague&rsquo;s semantics</h2>

<p>
The main non-propositionalist approaches to ITVs begin from the work
of Richard Montague, especially his paper &ldquo;The Proper Treatment
of Quantification in Ordinary English&rdquo; (R. Montague 1973,
usually referred to as PTQ in the literature); Montague&rsquo;s
condition (9) (1974, 264) defines &lsquo;seek&rsquo; as &lsquo;try to
find&rsquo;, but this is optional. Montague developed a systematic
semantics of natural language based on <em>higher-order intensional
type-theory</em>; for an accessible introduction, see (Dowty et al.,
1981). We explain the term &lsquo;higher-order intensional
type-theory&rsquo; right-to-left.</p>

<p>
Type theory embodies a specific model of semantic compositionality in
terms of <em>functional application</em>. According to this model, if
two expressions <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can concatenate into a
meaningful expression <em>xy</em>, then (i), the meaning of one of
these expressions is taken to be a function, (ii) the meaning of the
other is taken to be an item of the kind that the function in question
is defined for, and (iii) the meaning of <em>xy</em> is the output of
the function when applied to the input. The type-theoretic
representation of this meaning is written <strong>x(y)</strong> or
<strong>y(x)</strong>, depending on which expression is taken to be
the function and which the input or argument. A functional application
such as <strong>x(y)</strong> is said to be <em>well-typed</em> iff
the input that <strong>y</strong> denotes is the type of input for
which the function <strong>x</strong> is defined.</p>

<p>
For example, in <em>the simple theory of types</em>, a common noun
such as &lsquo;sweater&rsquo; is assigned a meaning of the following
type: a function from <em>individuals</em> to <em>truth-values</em> (a
function of type <em>ib</em>, for short, where <em>b</em> is for
&lsquo;boolean&rsquo;; the notation is a compressed version of that in
Carpenter, 1997). For &lsquo;sweater&rsquo; the function in question
is the one which maps all sweaters to the truth-value TRUE, and all
other individuals to the truth-value FALSE. On the other hand, an
(&ldquo;intersective&rdquo;) adjective such as &lsquo;woollen&rsquo;
would be assigned a meaning of the following type: a function from
(functions from individuals to truth-values) to (functions from
individuals to truth-values), or a function of type
(<em>ib</em>)(<em>ib</em>) for short. Thus the meaning of
&lsquo;woollen&rsquo; can take the meaning of &lsquo;sweater&rsquo;
(an <em>ib</em>) as input and produce the meaning of &lsquo;woollen
sweater&rsquo; (another <em>ib</em>) as output; this is why the
meaning of &lsquo;woollen&rsquo; has the type
(<em>ib</em>)(<em>ib</em>). <strong>woollen(sweater)</strong> is the
specific function of type <em>ib</em> that maps sweaters made of wool
to TRUE, and all other individuals to FALSE.</p>

<p>
In this framework, a quantified NP such as &lsquo;every sweater&rsquo;
has a meaning which can take the meaning of an intransitive verb
(e.g., &lsquo;unravelled&rsquo;), or more generally, a Verb Phrase
(VP), as input and produce the meaning (truth-value) of a sentence
(e.g. &lsquo;every sweater unravelled&rsquo;) as output. Intransitive
verbs and VPs are like common nouns in being of type <em>ib</em>. For
example, the VP <strong>quickly(unravelled)</strong> is of type
<em>ib</em>, mapping all and only individuals that unravelled quickly
to TRUE. So a quantified NP is a function from inputs of type
<em>ib</em> to outputs of type <em>b</em>, and is thus of type
(<em>ib</em>)<em>b</em>. &lsquo;Every sweater unravelled
quickly&rsquo; would be represented as
<strong>(every(sweater))(quickly(unravelled))</strong>, and would
denote the truth-value that is the result of applying a meaning of
type (<em>ib</em>)<em>b</em>, that of <strong>every(sweater)</strong>,
to a meaning of type <em>ib</em>, that of
<strong>quickly(unravelled)</strong> (the adverb
<strong>quickly</strong> itself is of type (<em>ib</em>)(<em>ib</em>),
like the adjective <strong>woollen</strong>). Rules specific to
<strong>every</strong> guarantee that <strong>every(sweater)</strong>
maps <strong>quickly(unravelled)</strong> to TRUE iff
<strong>quickly(unravelled)</strong> maps to TRUE whatever
<strong>sweater</strong> maps to TRUE.</p>

<p>
So far, the apparatus is extensional, which, besides providing only
two possible sentence-meanings, TRUE and FALSE, imposes severe
limitations on the range of concepts we can express. Suppose that the
Scottish clothing company Pringle has a worldwide monopoly on the
manufacture of woollen sweaters, and makes sweaters of no other
material. Then a garment is a woollen sweater iff it is a Pringle
sweater, meaning that <strong>woollen(sweater)</strong> and
<strong>pringle(sweater)</strong> are the same function of type
<em>ib</em>, and these two terms for that function are everywhere
interchangeable in the type-theoretic language. Then modal operators
such as &lsquo;it is contingent that&rsquo; cannot be in the language,
since interchanging <strong>woollen(sweater)</strong> and
<strong>pringle(sweater)</strong> within their scope should sometimes
lead to change of truth-value, but cannot if the two expressions
receive the same meaning in the semantics. For example, &lsquo;it is
contingent that every Pringle sweater is woollen&rsquo; is true, but
&lsquo;it is contingent that every woollen sweater is woollen&rsquo;
is false. Therefore the concept of contingency has no adequate
representation in the type-theoretic (boldface) language.</p>

<p>
Shifting to <em>intensional</em> type theory deals with this
difficulty. The intension of any expression X is a function from
possible worlds to an extension of the type which that expression has
in the extensional theory just sketched, if it has such an extension,
otherwise to something appropriate for intensional vocabulary such as
&lsquo;it is contingent that&rsquo;. An intension which is a function
from possible worlds to items of type <em><strong>t</strong></em> is
said to be of type <em>s<strong>t</strong></em>.
<strong>sweater</strong>, for instance, will have as its intension a
function from possible worlds to functions of type <em>ib</em>,
providing for each possible world a function that specifies the
individuals which are sweaters at that world; so
<strong>sweater</strong>&rsquo;s intension is of type
<em>s</em>(<em>ib</em>). However, a modal sentential operator such as
&lsquo;it is contingent that&rsquo; will have as its intension a
function that, for each possible world, produces the very same
function, which takes as input functions of type <em>sb</em> and
produces truth-values as output. So the extension of &lsquo;it is
contingent that&rsquo; at each world is the same function, of type
(<em>sb</em>)<em>b</em>. (The operator is said to be
<em>intensional</em> because its <em>ex</em>tension at each world is a
function taking <em>in</em>tensions, such as functions of type
<em>sb</em>, as input.)</p>

<p>
A function of type <em>sb</em> is sometimes called a
<em>possible-worlds proposition</em>, since it traces the truth-value
of a sentence across worlds. For example, with appropriate assignments
to the constituents,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(13)</dt>
<dd><strong>(every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen)</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>
should be true, that is, refer to TRUE, at every
 world.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 So the intension of (13) is the function <strong><em>f</em></strong>
of type <em>sb</em> such that for every world w,
<strong><em>f</em></strong>(w) = TRUE. This is a <em>constant</em>
intension. On the other hand,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(14)</dt>
<dd><strong>(every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen)</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>
is true at some worlds but false at others, those where Pringle makes
non-woollen sweaters; so its intension is non-constant.</p>

<p>
We define the intension of <strong>contingent</strong> to be the
function which, for each world <em>w</em> as input, produces as output
the function <strong><em>c</em></strong> of type
(<em>sb</em>)<em>b</em> such that for any function
<strong><em>p</em></strong> of type <em>sb</em>,
<strong><em>c</em></strong>(<strong><em>p</em></strong>) is true at w
iff there are worlds <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> such that
<strong><em>p</em></strong>(<em>u</em>) = TRUE and
<strong><em>p</em></strong>(<em>v</em>) = FALSE (this is the meaning
of &lsquo;contingent that&rsquo; in the sense &lsquo;contingent
whether&rsquo;). So the intension of &lsquo;contingent&rsquo; is also
constant, since the same function <strong><em>c</em></strong> is the
output at every world.</p>

<p>
Since <strong>contingent</strong> expects an input of type
<em>sb</em>, we cannot write</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(15)</dt>
<dd><strong>contingent((every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen))</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>
since in evaluating this formula at a world <em>w</em> we would find
ourselves trying to apply the reference of <strong>contingent</strong>
at w, namely, the function <strong><em>c</em></strong> just defined,
to the reference of
<strong>(every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen)</strong> at w, namely, the
truth-value TRUE. But <strong><em>c</em></strong> requires an input of
type <em>sb</em>, not <em>b</em>. So we introduce a new operator,
written <strong>^</strong>, such that if X is an expression and
<em><strong>t</strong></em> is the type of X&rsquo;s reference at each
world <em>w</em>, then at each <em>w</em>, the reference at <em>w</em>
of <strong>^</strong>X is of type <em>s<strong>t</strong></em>.
<strong>^</strong>X may be read as &lsquo;the intension of X&rsquo;,
since the rule for <strong>^</strong> is that at each world
<em>w</em>, <strong>^</strong>X refers to that function which for each
world <em>u</em>, outputs the reference of X at <em>u</em>.</p>

<p>
If we now evaluate</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(16)</dt>
<dd><strong>contingent^((every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen))</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>
at a world <em>w</em>, the result will be FALSE. This is because the
function <strong><em>p</em></strong> of type <em>sb</em> that is the
reference of <strong>^((every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen))</strong> at
every world, maps every world to TRUE. So there is no <em>u</em> such
that <strong><em>p</em></strong>(<em>u</em>) = FALSE. But there is
such a <em>u</em> for
<strong>^((every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen))</strong>, and so</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(17)</dt>
<dd><strong>contingent^((every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen))</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>
is TRUE at <em>w</em>. Note that choice of <em>w</em> doesn&rsquo;t
matter, since the intension of <strong>contingent</strong> produces
the same function <strong><em>c</em></strong> at every world, and the
reference of, e.g.,
<strong>^((every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen))</strong>, is the same
function of type <em>sb</em> at every world.</p>

<p>
Finally, our type-theory, intensional or extensional, is
<em>higher-order</em>, because the semantics makes available
higher-order domains of quantification and reference.
<strong>sweater</strong> refers to a property of individuals, a
<em>first-order</em> property. <strong>(every(sweater))</strong>
refers to a property of properties of individuals, a second-order
property. For just as <strong>sweater(my favorite garment)</strong>
attributes the property of being a sweater to a certain individual, so
we can think of <strong>(every(sweater))(woollen)</strong> as
attributing a property to the property of being woollen. Which
property is attributed to being woollen? The rules governing
<strong>every</strong> ensure that <strong>(every(F))</strong> is
truly predicated of <strong>G</strong> iff <strong>G</strong> is a
property of every <em>F</em>. In that case, <strong>G</strong> has the
property of being a property of every <em>F</em>. So
<strong>(every(F))</strong> stands for the property of being a
property of every <em>F</em>.</p>

<p>
Treating quantified NPs as terms for properties of properties means
they can occur as arguments to any expression defined for properties
of properties. We can even rescue the uncomprehending student&rsquo;s
attempt at &lsquo;Jack hit someone&rsquo;, for provided
&lsquo;hit&rsquo; is of the right type &mdash; which is easily
arranged &mdash; we can have <strong>(hit(someone))(jack)</strong>.
Here <strong>hit</strong> accepts the property of being a property of
at least one person, and produces the first-order property of hitting
someone, which is then attributed to Jack. In extensional type-theory,
<strong>hit</strong> has the type
((<em>ib</em>)<em>b</em>)(<em>ib</em>) if
<strong>(hit(someone))(jack)</strong> is well-typed and
<strong>jack</strong> is of type
 <em>i</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The significance of this for the semantics of intensional transitives
is that we now have a way of representing a reading of, say,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(18)</dt>
<dd>Jack wants a woollen sweater</dd>
</dl>

<p>
in which the quantified NP is within the semantic scope of the verb
without having scope over a hidden subsentence with a free variable
for the NP to bind (recall (6b)): the quantified NP &lsquo;a woollen
sweater&rsquo; can just be the argument to the verb. To allow for the
intensionality of the transitive verb, Montague adopts the rule that
if <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can concatenate into a meaningful
expression <em>xy</em>, the reference of the functional expression is
a function which operates on the <em>intension</em> of the argument
expression. Suppressing some irrelevant detail, this means that if
&lsquo;wants&rsquo; syntactically combines with &lsquo;a woollen
sweater&rsquo; to produce the VP &lsquo;wants a woollen
sweater&rsquo;, then in its semantics, <strong>want</strong> applies
to the intension of <strong>(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong>, resulting
in the following semantics for (18):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(19)</dt>

<dd><strong>want(^(a(woollen(sweater))))(jack)</strong>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
In (19), <strong>a(woollen((sweater)))</strong> is within the scope of
<strong>want</strong>. So if we take (19) to represent the notional
reading of (18), the idea that notional readings are readings in which
the quantified NP has narrow scope with respect to the intensional
verb is sustained.</p>

<h2 id="ReviRefi">5. Revisions and refinements</h2>

<p>
How does Montague&rsquo;s account of intensional transitives fare
<em>vis</em> <em>&agrave;</em> <em>vis</em> the three marks of
intensionality? The existence-neutrality of existential NPs is clearly
supported by (19), for there is nothing to prevent the application at
a world <em>w</em> of <strong>want</strong> to
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong> from producing a function
mapping Jack to TRUE even if, at the same <em>w</em>,
<strong>(woollen(sweater))</strong> maps every individual to FALSE
(i.e., woollen sweaters don&rsquo;t exist at <em>w</em>).</p>

<p>
Substitution-failure is supported for contingently coextensive
expressions. For instance, (19) does not entail
<strong>want(^(a(pringle(sweater))))(jack)</strong> even if there are
worlds where all and only woollen sweaters are Pringle sweaters, so
long as there are other worlds where this is not so. Let <em>u</em> be
a world of the latter sort. Then <strong>a(pringle(sweater))</strong>
at <em>u</em> and <strong>a(woollen(sweater))</strong> at <em>u</em>
are different functions of type (<em>ib</em>)<em>b</em>, making
<strong>^(a(pringle(sweater)))</strong> and
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong> different at every world.
Therefore <strong>want(^(a(pringle(sweater))))</strong> may map Jack
to FALSE at worlds where <strong>want(^(a(woollen(sweater))))</strong>
maps Jack to TRUE: since <strong>want</strong> is applied to different
inputs here, the outputs may also be different.</p>

<p>
But this result depends on the fact that
<strong>(pringle(sweater))</strong> and
<strong>(woollen(sweater))</strong> are merely contingently
coextensive. If &lsquo;water&rsquo; and &lsquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rsquo;
are <em>necessarily</em> co-extensive, then wanting a glass of water
and wanting a glass of H<sub>2</sub>O will be indistinguishable in
higher-order intensional type theory. This failure to make a
distinction, however, traces to the intensionality of the semantics
&mdash; to its being (merely) a possible-worlds semantics &mdash; not
to its being higher-order or type-theoretic. So possible solutions
include (i) augmenting higher-order intensional type theory with extra
apparatus, or (ii) employing a different kind of higher-order type
theory. In both cases the aim is to mark distinctions like that
between wanting a glass of water and wanting a glass of
H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>
A solution of the first kind, following (Carnap 1947), is proposed in
Lewis 1972 (182&ndash;6); the idea is that the meaning of a complex
expression is not its intension, but rather a tree that exhibits the
expression&rsquo;s syntactic construction bottom-up, with each node in
the tree decorated by an appropriate syntactic category label and
semantic intension. But as Lewis says (p. 182), for non-compound
lexical constituents, sameness of intension implies sameness of
meaning. So although his approach will handle the water/H<sub>2</sub>O
problem if we assume the term &lsquo;H<sub>2</sub>O&rsquo; has
structure that the term &lsquo;water&rsquo; lacks, it will not without
such an assumption. For the same reason, it cannot explain
substitution-failure involving unstructured proper names, on the usual
view (deriving from Kripke 1972) that identity of extension (at any
world) for such names implies identity of intension. So we have no
account of why admiring Cicero isn&rsquo;t the same thing as admiring
Tully.</p>

<p>
A solution of the second kind, employing a different kind of
higher-order type theory, is pursued in Thomason 1980. In
Thomason&rsquo;s &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; logic, propositions are
taken as a primitive category, instead of being analyzed as intensions
of type <em>sb</em>. In turns out that a somewhat familiar
higher-order type theory can be built on this basis, in which,
roughly, the type of propositions plays a role analogous to the type
of truth-values in extensional type theory. A property such as
<strong>orator</strong>, for example, is a function of type
<em>ip</em> (as opposed to <em>ib</em>), where <em>p</em> is the type
of propositions: given an individual as input, <strong>orator</strong>
will output the proposition that that individual is an orator. Proper
names, however, are not translated as terms of type <em>i</em>, for
then <strong>cicero</strong> and <strong>tully</strong> would present
the same input to <strong>orator</strong>, resulting in the same
proposition as output: <strong>orator(cicero)</strong> =
<strong>orator(tully)</strong>. So there would be no believing Cicero
is an orator without believing Tully is an orator. Instead, Thomason
assigns proper names the type (<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em>, functions from
properties to propositions. And merely the fact that Cicero and Tully
are the same individual does not require us to say that
<strong>cicero</strong> and <strong>tully</strong> must produce the
same propositional output given the same property input. Instead, we
can have <strong>cicero(orator)</strong> and
<strong>tully(orator)</strong> be distinct propositions, allowing for
an agent to {assume/believe/doubt/hear/suggest} one but not the other
(see Muskens 2005 for further development of Thomason&rsquo;s
approach).</p>

<p>
Applying this to intensional transitives is just a matter of assigning
appropriate types so that the translations of, say, &lsquo;Lucia seeks
Cicero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lucia seeks Tully&rsquo;, are different
propositions (potentially with different truth-values). We need to
keep the verb as function, and we already have the types of
<strong>cicero</strong> and <strong>tully</strong> set to
(<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em>. The translations of &lsquo;seeks
Cicero&rsquo; and &lsquo;seeks Tully&rsquo; should be functions
capable of accepting inputs of type (<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em>, such as
<strong>lucia</strong>, and producing propositions as output.
<strong>seeks</strong> therefore accepts input of type
(<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em> and produces output that accepts input of type
(<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em> and produces output of type <em>p</em>. Thus
<strong>seeks</strong> is of type
((<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em>)(((<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em>)<em>p</em>), and we
get substitution-failure because <strong>seeks(cicero)</strong> and
<strong>seeks(tully)</strong> can be different functions of type
((<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em>)<em>p</em> so long as <strong>cicero</strong>
and <strong>tully</strong> are different functions of type
(<em>ip</em>)<em>p</em> (as we already said they should be).
<strong>seeks(cicero)</strong> can therefore map
<strong>lucia</strong> to one proposition while
<strong>seeks(tully)</strong> maps it (not &lsquo;her&rsquo;) to
another; and these two propositions can have different
 truth-values.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Finally, there is the question whether (19) shows that
Montague&rsquo;s semantics supports notional readings. One problem is
that Montague&rsquo;s semantics for extensional verbs such as
&lsquo;get&rsquo; is exactly the same as for intensional verbs, and it
takes an extra stipulation, or <em>meaning-postulate</em>, for
&lsquo;get&rsquo;, to guarantee that the extension of
<strong>get(^(a(woollen(sweater))))</strong> at <em>w</em> maps Jack
to TRUE only if the extension of <strong>(woollen(sweater))</strong>
at <em>w</em> maps some individual to TRUE (you can want a golden
fleece even if there aren&rsquo;t any, but you can&rsquo;t
<em>get</em> one if there aren&rsquo;t any). So apparently
(19)&rsquo;s pattern embodies something in common to the notional
meaning of &lsquo;want a woollen sweater&rsquo; and the meaning of
&lsquo;gets a woollen sweater&rsquo;, something which is neutral on
the existence of woollen sweaters. This is unintuitive, but is perhaps
not a serious problem, since it can be avoided by a different
treatment of extensional transitives.</p>

<p>
A more pressing question is what justification we have for thinking
that (19) captures the notional, &lsquo;no particular one&rsquo;,
reading of
 (18).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 On the face of it, (19) imputes to Jack the wanting attitude towards
the property of being a property of a woollen sweater. This is the
same wanting attitude as Jack may stand in to a particular woollen
sweater, say <em>that</em> one. But it is not at all clear that we
have any grasp of what a single attitude with such diverse objects
could be, and the difficulty seems to lie mainly with the proposed
semantics for notional readings. What does it mean to have the
attitude of desire towards the property of being a property of a
woollen sweater?</p>

<p>
Two ways of dealing with this suggest themselves. First, we might
supplement the formal semantics with an elucidation of <em>what it
is</em> to stand in a common-or-garden attitude to a property of
properties. Second, we might revise the analysis to eliminate this
counterintuitive aspect of it, but without importing the
propositionalist&rsquo;s hidden sentential contexts.</p>

<p>
Both (Moltmann 1997) and (Richard 2001) can be read as providing,
within Montague&rsquo;s general approach, an account of what it is to
stand in an attitude relation to a property of properties. Both
accounts are modal, having to do with the nature of possible
situations in which the attitude is in some sense
&ldquo;matched&rdquo; by the situation: an attitude-state of need or
expectation is matched if the need or expectation is met, an
attitude-state of desire is matched if the desire is satisfied, an
attitude-event of seeking is met if the search concludes successfully,
and so on. According to Moltmann&rsquo;s account (1997, 22&ndash;3)
one stands in the attitude relation of seeking towards
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong> iff, in every <em>minimal
situation</em> &sigma; in which that search concludes successfully,
you find a woollen sweater in &sigma; (see also Moltmann (2013, Ch.5)
for development of her views). Richard (2001, 116) offers a complex
analysis that is designed to handle negative quantified NPs as well
(&lsquo;no woollen sweater&rsquo;, &lsquo;few woollen sweaters&rsquo;,
etc.). On this account, a search &pi; <em>demands</em>
<strong>^(a(P))</strong> iff for every relevant success-story
<em>m</em> = &lt;<em>w</em>, <em>s</em>&gt; for &pi;, things in
<em>s</em> with a property entailing <strong>P</strong> are in the
extension of <strong>^(a(P))</strong> at <em>w</em>. Here <em>s</em>
is the set of things that are found when the search concludes
successfully in <em>w</em>.</p>

<p>
By contrast, Zalta (1988), Zimmerman (1993) and Forbes (2000; 2006)
propose revisions in (19) itself and its ilk. Zalta formulates an
intensional semantics in which propositions are constructed directly,
using various construction operations, beginning with primitive
objects and properties. For instance, a primitive monadic property has
a gap, and there is a plugging operation which allows the gap to be
filled with an object to produce a monadic proposition. This in turn
may be identified as that which is expressed by a particular sentence,
arrived at by standard recursion. However, Zalta&rsquo;s main
objection to the Montagovian approach is not that the idea of holding
an attitude towards a property of properties has no intuitive content,
special cases aside. It is rather that some correct entailments are
not verified, for example, the entailment from &lsquo;John is looking
in his briefcase for a pen&rsquo; to &lsquo;John is looking in his
briefcase for something&rsquo;. There may or may not be a particular
pen John is looking for in his briefcase, but in either case, as Zalta
remarks (1988, 81), &ldquo;if one tapped him on the shoulder and asked
what he was doing, he might respond &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for
something&rdquo;&rdquo;, which seems natural and true however the
premise is construed. Montague could force this consequence with a
meaning-postulate, but it flows directly from Zalta&rsquo;s account of
unspecific readings, in which there is a distinction between
<em>exemplifying</em> and <em>encoding</em> properties. The notional
reading of &lsquo;looking for a pen&rsquo; is satisfied only if there
is an abstract object which encodes being a pen and to which John
stands in the seeking relation, so indeed John is looking for
something (Zalta 1988, 82&ndash;3). </p>

<p>
Zimmerman (1993, 161&ndash;2) replaces the quantifier intension with a
property intension, since he holds that (i) unspecific readings are
restricted to &ldquo;broadly&rdquo; existential quantified NPs, and
(ii) the property corresponding to the nominal in the existential NP
(e.g., &lsquo;woollen sweater&rsquo;) can do duty for the NP itself.
Of course, the proposed restriction of unspecific readings to
existentials is controversial (<em>cf</em>. our earlier example,
&lsquo;the police are looking for everyone who witnessed the
incident&rsquo;). It may also be wondered whether there is any less of
a need to explain what it is to stand in the seeking relation to a
property of objects than to a property of properties (but for a
response to this kind of objection, see Grzankowski 2018,
146&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
According to (Forbes 2000) the need for such an explanation already
threatens the univocality of a verb such as &lsquo;look for&rsquo; as
it occurs in &lsquo;look for <em>that</em> woollen sweater&rsquo; and
&lsquo;look for some woollen sweater&rsquo;. Observing that search
verbs are action verbs, Forbes applies Davidson&rsquo;s event
semantics to them (Davidson 1967). In this semantics, as revised and
extended in Parsons 1990, search verbs become predicates of events,
and in relational (specific) readings, the object searched for is said
to be in a thematic relation to the event, one denoted by
&lsquo;for&rsquo;; thus if I am looking for a specific woollen
sweater, <em>that</em> one you see in the top drawer, this means
&lsquo;some search <em>e</em> such that I am the agent of <em>e</em>
is for <em>that</em> woollen sweater&rsquo;. By contrast, in
unspecific readings no thematic relation to sweaters is invoked;
rather, the quantified NP is used to <em>characterize</em> the search,
or to assign it a <em>kind</em>. So we would have &lsquo;some search
<em>e</em> is characterized by
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong>&rsquo;, i.e., <em>e</em> is a
search of the a-woollen-sweater kind (Forbes 2000, 174&ndash;6; 2006,
77&ndash;84). The predicate &lsquo;search&rsquo; is univocal across
specific and unspecific readings, and what it is for a search to be
characterized by a quantifier, say
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong>, is explained in terms of
&lsquo;outcome postulates&rsquo;. For the current example, as a first
approximation, a search is characterized by
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong> iff any course of events in
which that search culminates successfully includes an event of finding
a woollen sweater, and the agent of the finding is the agent of the
search. Similar postulates can be given for, e.g., the meeting of
expectations and the satisfaction of desires: thus, a state of desire
is characterized by <strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong> iff any
course of events in which that desire is satisfied includes an event
of getting a woollen sweater whose recipient is the agent of the
search (Forbes 2006, 94&ndash;129). So this part of the theory is
similar to those of Moltmann and Richard, but is an analysis of an
event being characterized by a quantifier, as opposed to being for
that quantifier. Zalta&rsquo;s requirement that looking for a woollen
sweater, but no particular one, entail looking for something, can be
met in various ways, of which the simplest is to treat it as a
conjunction-elimination: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for something&rdquo;
means that I am the agent of some event of looking. Alternatively,
since the &lsquo;something&rsquo; here is what Moltmann calls a
&lsquo;special&rsquo; quantifier (see, e.g., Moltmann 2013,
169&ndash;175) a semantics keyed to such quantifiers could be
employed.</p>

<p>
There is therefore a range of different non-propositionalist
approaches to intensional transitives. As we already remarked, one
possibility is that propositionalism is correct for some verbs and
non-propositionalism correct for others. However, there is also the
option that non-propositionalism is correct for all. A
non-propositionalist who makes this claim will have to explain the
phenomena illustrated in (7)&ndash;(10), without introducing degrees
of freedom that make it unintelligible that these phenomena do not
arise for all intensional transitives.</p>

<h2 id="PrioPuzz">6. Prior&rsquo;s Puzzle</h2>

<p>
Intensional transitive verbs are also involved in another substitution
puzzle besides the ones already discussed. In the literature on
propositional attitude reports, it&rsquo;s the received view that the
complement clauses in such reports refer to propositions. So, for
example, in &lsquo;Holmes believes that Moriarty has returned&rsquo;,
the clause &lsquo;that Moriarty has returned&rsquo; is taken to stand
for the proposition that Moriarty has returned. The whole ascription
is then understood to have the form <em>Rab</em>, which in terms of
the example means that Holmes (<em>a</em>) stands in the relation of
belief (<em>R</em>) to the proposition that Moriarty has returned
(<em>b</em>). However, as well as being denoted by
<em>that</em>-clauses, propositions are the likely candidate for the
things denoted by proposition-descriptions, noun phrases that
explicitly use &lsquo;the proposition&rsquo;, such as, in the previous
sentence, &lsquo;the proposition that Moriarty has returned&rsquo;.
So, if the clause and the description co-denote, we have the following
truth:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(20)</dt>
<dd>that Moriarty has returned is the proposition that Moriarty has
returned.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But then we should be able to substitute proposition-description for
<em>that</em>-clause, which, indeed, works well enough for
&lsquo;believes&rsquo;: believing that Moriarty has returned does not
seem much different from believing the proposition that Moriarty has
returned, even though a side-effect of replacing the clause by the
description is to convert a clausal use of &lsquo;believes&rsquo; into
a transitive one. However, &lsquo;believes&rsquo; is rather special in
this respect. Despite (20), examples (21a) and (21b) below appear to
have very different meanings:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(21a)</dt>
<dd>Holmes {fears/suspects} that Moriarty has returned.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(21b)</dt>
<dd>Holmes {fears/suspects} the proposition that Moriarty has
returned.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(21a) may well be true, but it is unlikely that Holmes fears a
proposition, or that some proposition is a thing of which he is
suspicious (though a mathematician might be suspicious of a
proposition he has used, without rigorous proof, as a lemma in
obtaining an unexpected result). So replacing either clausal VP in
(21a) with the corresponding intensional transitive VP in (21b) opens
the door to change in truth-value. This phenomenon seems first to have
been noted in print in Prior 1963.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Believe&rsquo; is hardly the only intensional verb which allows
clause/proposition-description interchange. There are also inference
verbs such as &lsquo;assume&rsquo;, &lsquo;conclude&rsquo;,
&lsquo;deduce&rsquo;, &lsquo;entail&rsquo; and
&lsquo;establish&rsquo;, along with some others such as
&lsquo;accept&rsquo;, &lsquo;assert&rsquo;, &lsquo;convey&rsquo;,
&lsquo;doubt&rsquo;, &lsquo;proclaim&rsquo;, &lsquo;state&rsquo; and
&lsquo;verify&rsquo;, perhaps &lsquo;insinuate&rsquo;, and arguably
&lsquo;show&rsquo; and &lsquo;signal&rsquo; (for more on
&lsquo;believe&rsquo;, see King 2002, 359&ndash;60, Forbes 2018, 118,
and Nebel 2019, 97&ndash;9). For example, if an accomplice signals to
a thief that someone is coming, to my ear it doesn&rsquo;t sound out
of the question to say that the accomplice thereby signals the
proposition to the thief, especially if we are happy to say that
conveying that <em>p</em> and conveying the proposition that
<em>p</em> are the same thing, since signalling is a way of conveying.
There are also speech-act verbs we could include here, perhaps
somewhat stipulatively: &lsquo;mention&rsquo;, &lsquo;vow&rsquo;,
maybe &lsquo;volunteer&rsquo;. For example, if Holmes vows that he
will apprehend Moriarty, some speakers will be willing to say that he
thereby vowed the proposition.</p>

<p>
But clear failures in the style of (21b) are also common, despite the
fuzziness of the boundary between verbs which do and verbs which
don&rsquo;t generate instances of Prior&rsquo;s Puzzle. The following
verbs appear to be similar to &lsquo;fears&rsquo; and
&lsquo;suspects&rsquo;: &lsquo;acknowledge&rsquo;,
&lsquo;announce&rsquo;, &lsquo;anticipate&rsquo;, &lsquo;ask&rsquo;,
&lsquo;boast&rsquo;, &lsquo;calculate&rsquo;, &lsquo;caution&rsquo;,
&lsquo;decide&rsquo;, &lsquo;detect&rsquo;, &lsquo;discover&rsquo;,
&lsquo;dream&rsquo;, &lsquo;estimate&rsquo;, &lsquo;find&rsquo;,
&lsquo;forget&rsquo;, &lsquo;guess&rsquo;, &lsquo;judge&rsquo;,
&lsquo;know&rsquo;, &lsquo;love&rsquo;, &lsquo;notice&rsquo;,
&lsquo;observe&rsquo;, &lsquo;perceive&rsquo;, &lsquo;prefer&rsquo;,
&lsquo;question&rsquo;, &lsquo;realize&rsquo;, &lsquo;require&rsquo;,
&lsquo;see&rsquo;, &lsquo;suggest&rsquo;, &lsquo;surmise&rsquo;,
&lsquo;suspect&rsquo;, &lsquo;trust&rsquo;, &lsquo;understand&rsquo;,
&lsquo;vote&rsquo;, and &lsquo;wish&rsquo;. With some of these verbs,
substitution produces something with a reasonably clear meaning, just
not the same meaning as the sentence the substitution was made in (as
in 21a,b). With others, intelligibility is strained. The case of
&lsquo;estimate&rsquo; illustrates violation of a selection
constraint. An early astronomer may estimate that the Sun is 90
million miles away, but he cannot be said to have estimated <em>the
proposition</em> that the Sun is 90 million miles away. In transitive
uses, the direct object of &lsquo;estimate&rsquo; must be for
something at least roughly measurable in some dimension. Thus you can
estimate the acceptability, plausibility, or probability of a
proposition, but you cannot estimate (as opposed to assess) a
proposition for plausibility; this is at best an inept way of saying
that you estimate the proposition&rsquo;s plausibility.
&lsquo;Boast&rsquo; and &lsquo;plan&rsquo; are similar to
&lsquo;estimate&rsquo; in this respect. For example, you may plan that
the money you&rsquo;ve borrowed will last to the end of the month, but
you don&rsquo;t plan the proposition; and while Lestrade may boast
that he has found Moriarty, &lsquo;boast&rsquo; in its transitive use
will take on the sense it has in &lsquo;At dinner Elizabeth boasted
the necklace Richard had just bought her&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
In another group of intensional verbs are ones which don&rsquo;t seem
to have transitive uses in English, other than, in some cases, with
anaphoric pronouns anchored by clauses (if this is a transitive use at
all). These include &lsquo;agree&rsquo;, &lsquo;complain&rsquo;,
&lsquo;crow&rsquo;, &lsquo;hope&rsquo;, &lsquo;insist&rsquo;,
&lsquo;object&rsquo;, &lsquo;pretend&rsquo;, &lsquo;rejoice&rsquo;,
&lsquo;wish&rsquo;, and perhaps &lsquo;insinuate&rsquo; (if you balked
at counting it an ITV that doesn&rsquo;t give rise to Prior&rsquo;s
Puzzle). These verbs will give rise to instances of the Puzzle in
which the conclusion isn&rsquo;t even grammatical (see Nebel 2019,
72&ndash;5, for discussion; ungrammatical conclusions are also
obtained from verbs like &lsquo;warn&rsquo;, where grammatical
&lsquo;<em>x</em> warned <em>y</em> that <em>p</em>&rsquo; would
become &lsquo;<em>x</em> warned <em>y</em> the proposition that
<em>p</em>&rsquo;).</p>

<p>
The puzzle doesn&rsquo;t depend on the credentials of (20) as an
identity sentence. Even if, for whatever reason, it isn&rsquo;t, it is
still hard to see how truth-value can change going from (21a) to
(21b), granted that <em>the proposition that Moriarty has
returned</em> and <em>that Moriarty has returned</em> are co-denoting.
There also doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a useful application of a
traditional account of referential opacity, such as Frege&rsquo;s
(discussed in connection with (2c) above). Substitution-failure is
explained in Fregean terms by a switch in denotation of normally
co-denoting expressions, when those expressions are put into an
intensional context. But if we accept that (20) states a true identity
between intensional entities, and that the denotations of the
expressions flanking the &lsquo;is&rsquo; are grasped in the same way,
by compositional construction, then these expressions for propositions
will express the same sense in (20). Therefore, rotating the
expressions in the context &lsquo;Holmes fears&hellip;&rsquo; cannot
produce a change in truth-value, even if the reference of each
switches to the sense it expresses in (20). For the new reference of
&lsquo;that Moriarty has returned&rsquo; in (21a) will still be the
same as that of &lsquo;the proposition that Moriarty has
returned&rsquo; in (21b). There is even less of a solution to the
Puzzle if these examples are a special case in which the embedding
does not produce a switch.</p>

<p>
We also expect that examples of substitution-failure are made weaker
if the subject is attributed explicit belief in the identity premise.
However, adding that Holmes is absolutely clear about the truth of
(20), and has it at the forefront of his consciousness, doesn&rsquo;t
make it any more likely that (21b) is true when (21a) is.
Consequently, there is some appeal to solutions of Prior&rsquo;s
Puzzle that discern an equivocation in the inference, or propose that
the crucial terms, <em>the proposition that Moriarty has returned</em>
and <em>that Moriarty has returned</em>, aren&rsquo;t really
coreferential as they occur in the inference. An approach of the first
kind, in King 2002, argues that the transitive and clausal forms of
the intensional verb are <em>polysemous</em>, that is, weakly
ambiguous (the two senses are related, as, plausibly, with
&lsquo;boast&rsquo; or &lsquo;understand&rsquo;). The polysemy thesis
has been criticized on the basis of ellipsis examples, such as
&lsquo;Bob didn&rsquo;t even mention the proposition that first-order
logic is undecidable, let alone that it is provable&rsquo; (Boer 2009,
552), and &lsquo;the Soviet authorities genuinely fear a religious
revival, and that the contagion of religion will spread&rsquo; (after
Nebel 2019, 77). Since these examples don&rsquo;t strike one as
amusingly incongruous, in the way that typical examples of zeugma do
(&lsquo;All over Ireland the farmers grew potatoes, barley, and
bored&rsquo;), they are in tension with a postulation of polysemy.
Consequently, Boer (2009) and Nebel (2019) propose that the problem
lies in non-synonymy in Prior&rsquo;s Puzzle of the terms <em>the
proposition that Moriarty has returned</em> and <em>that Moriarty has
returned</em>. On both their accounts, it is the propositional
description &lsquo;the proposition that <em>p</em>&rsquo; which fails
to denote the proposition that <em>p</em>. On the other hand, as
evidence in favor of polysemy, there is the fact that some cases of
ellipsis seem in some way anomalous, such as &lsquo;John heard thunder
and that a storm was rolling in&rsquo;. Here the anomaly can be
explained in terms of <em>how</em> different the two senses of
&lsquo;heard&rsquo; are.</p>

<p>
Event semantics (see section 5 above, <em>ad fin</em>) provides an
alternative which may avoid the need for any kind of equivocation. An
initial proposal is made in Pietroski 2000 for &lsquo;explain&rsquo;,
which behaves like &lsquo;fear&rsquo; and &lsquo;suspect&rsquo;, as
in</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(22a)</dt>
<dd>Martin explained that the nothing nothings itself.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(22b)</dt>
<dd>Martin explained the proposition that the nothing nothings
itself.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A student raises his hand in Martin&rsquo;s class and asks why, if the
nothing is a something, he has never encountered it. Then (22a) may
well be true, but (22b) need not be. The proposal is that the clausal
and transitive forms of &lsquo;explain&rsquo; take different thematic
complements, <em>content</em> versus <em>theme:</em> with the clausal
verb of (22a), a &lsquo;that&rsquo;-clause provides the content of the
explanation, while with the transitive verb of (22b), a
proposition-description provides a theme, the thing that <em>gets</em>
explained. Since, as already noted, a side-effect of the substitution
is to change the verb from its clausal to its transitive form, a
consequent side-effect is to change the role ascribed to the
proposition from content to theme, a change which is
truth-condition-altering. This account is developed in Pietroski 2005
and also, as an extension of the event semantics of Forbes 2006, in
Forbes 2018.</p>

<p>
In addition to its intrinsic interest, Prior&rsquo;s Puzzle has wider
significance. For there are many approaches to the semantics of
intensional <em>clausal</em> verbs which employ the corresponding
transitive form in the semantics in place of the clausal one, and
Prior&rsquo;s Puzzle shows that in general this switch is dangerous. A
paradigm case of the clausal to transitive shift is in the
&lsquo;paratactic&rsquo; theory developed by Davidson (1969).
According to the paratactic theory, an attitude or speech-act
ascription made in a single sentence is in fact the product of a
two-sentence discourse, where the order of the two sentences is
immaterial. So, according to Davidson (1969, 169&ndash;70),
&lsquo;Galileo said that the Earth moves&rsquo; is more perspicuously
rendered as [The Earth moves. Galileo said <em>that</em>.] (I use
brackets to mark a paratactic discourse). Here the italicized
&lsquo;that&rsquo; is a demonstrative, one whose reference is much
debated in the literature on Davidson&rsquo;s theory (see Frankish
1996). But regardless of what position we take on this question, there
is a problematic change in going from &lsquo;Galileo said that the
Earth moves&rsquo; to [The Earth moves. Galileo said <em>that</em>.],
since clausal &lsquo;said&rsquo; in the former has become transitive
&lsquo;said&rsquo; in the latter. This may not matter much to this
example, if we are happy with talk of <em>saying a proposition</em>,
or whatever else we think the &lsquo;that&rsquo; refers to. But when
we replace &lsquo;say&rsquo; with an intensional clausal verb that
clearly does generate instances of Prior&rsquo;s Puzzle, for example,
&lsquo;discover&rsquo;, then the second sentence of the analysis will
mean that, whatever entity the &lsquo;that&rsquo; refers to, Galileo
discovered it. This entity might be a sentence (token or type), or a
more elaborate abstract object of some sort, but in no case was it
discovered by Galileo (though he did discover the <em>fact</em> that
the Earth moves &ndash; see also Moffett (2003, 82ff.) on &lsquo;the
fact that&rsquo; and &lsquo;the possibility that&rsquo;). So the
example is just like (21b). And there is, obviously, the problem of
verbs with <em>no</em> corresponding transitive form (see Forbes 2025,
&sect;3, for discussion of this difficulty). Thus the paratactic
analysis and others like it in the crucial respect are of limited
scope, applying at best to verbs like those listed two paragraphs
below (21b) as allowing (clause)/(proposition-description)
interchange.</p>

<h2 id="LogiInteTran">7. The logic of intensional transitives</h2>

<p>
There may be no such topic as the logic of <em>propositional</em>
attitudes: it may be doubted whether &lsquo;Mary wants to meet a man
who has read Proust and a man who has read Gide&rsquo;
<em>logically</em> entails &lsquo;Mary wants to meet a man who has
read Proust&rsquo;, if we understand the infinitival clause as
specifying a conjunctive desire with no ellipsis. For even if standing
in the wanting-to-be-true attitude to the proposition <em>I meet a man
who has read Proust and a man who has read Gide</em> somehow
necessitates standing in the wanting-to-be-true attitude to <em>I meet
a man who has read Proust</em>, the necessitation appears to be more
psychological than logical. On the other hand, what we might call
&lsquo;objectual attitudes&rsquo;, the non-propositional attitudes
ascribed by intensional transitives, seem to have a logic (for a
compendium of examples, see Richard 2000, 105&ndash;7): &lsquo;Mary
seeks a man who has read Proust and a man who has read Gide&rsquo;
does seem to entail &lsquo;Mary seeks a man who has read
Proust&rsquo;, even if there is no second &lsquo;seeks&rsquo; elided
following &lsquo;and&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Yet, as Richard notes (Richard 2001, 107&ndash;8), the inferential
behavior of quantified complements of intensional transitives is still
very different from the extensional case. For example (his
&lsquo;Literary Example&rsquo;), even if it is true that Mary seeks a
man who has read Proust and a man who has read Gide, it may be false
both that she seeks at most one man and that she seeks at least two
men; for she may be indifferent between finding a man who has read
both, versus finding two men, one a reader of Proust but not Gide, the
other of Gide but not Proust. Contrast &lsquo;saw&rsquo;,
&lsquo;photographed&rsquo;, or &lsquo;met&rsquo;: if she met a man who
has read Proust and a man who has read Gide, it cannot be false both
that she met at most at one man and that she met at least two men. As
Richard insists, it is a constraint on any semantics of intensional
transitives that they get this type of case right.</p>

<p>
By contrast, in other cases, even very simple ones, it is
controversial exactly what inferences intensional transitives in
unspecific readings support. If Mary seeks a man who has read Proust,
does it follow that she seeks a man who can read? After all, it is
unlikely that a comic-book reader will satisfy her tastes in
 men.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 If Perseus seeks a mortal gorgon, does it follow that he seeks a
 gorgon?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 After all, if he finds an immortal gorgon, he is in trouble.
Zimmerman (1993, 173) takes it to be a requirement on accounts of
notional readings that they validate these detachment or
&ldquo;weakening&rdquo; inferences, in which, typically, a restrictive
relative clause is detached, or a subsective or intersective adjective
(so looking for a lost Picasso entails looking for a Picasso, but
looking for an alleged Picasso does not, nor does looking for a forged
Picasso). But some accounts of unspecificity certainly invalidate
these inferences, even if the inferences are restricted as just
indicated, for instance, an account in terms of indifference towards
which object of the relevant kind is found (Lewis uses such an
&lsquo;any one would do&rsquo; characterization in Lewis 1972, p.
199). For even if it is true that Mary seeks a man who has read
Proust, and any male Proust-reader would do, it does not follow that
Mary seeks a man who can read, and any man who can read would do.
However surprising, not every man who can read has read Proust. So by
the lights of the indifference account, the premise that Mary seeks a
man who has read Proust doesn&rsquo;t entail that she seeks a man who
can read; thus weakening is fallacious.</p>

<p>
But the indifference characterization of unspecificity (&lsquo;any one
would do&rsquo;) is itself dubious. One objection is that the
characterization does not work for every verb or quantifier:
&lsquo;Guercino painted a dog, any dog would do&rsquo; makes little
sense, and &lsquo;the police are looking for everyone who was in the
room, any people who were in the room would do&rsquo; is not much
better. Worse, the characterization puts warranted assertibility out
of reach, since the grounds which we normally take to justify
ascribing an existentially quantified search-goal will rarely give
reason to think that the agent has absolutely no further preferences
going beyond the characterization of the object-kind given in the
ascription (Mary would surely pass on finding a Proust-reading but
murderous misogynist); see further (Graff Fara 2013) for analogous
discussion of desire.</p>

<p>
Still, this is not to validate weakening inferences; for that we would
probably want to show that the more usual gloss of the unspecific
reading, using a &lsquo;but no particular one&rsquo; rider, supports
the inferences as strongly as the indifference characterization
refutes them. And it is unclear how such an argument would proceed
(Forbes 2006, 94&ndash;6). In addition, making a good case that the
inferences are intuitively valid is one thing, getting the semantics
to validate them is another (though things are simpler in a
non-model-theoretic approach to the question &ndash; see Francez 2016,
811&ndash;814). Both the propositionalist and the Montagovian need to
add extra principles, since there is nothing in their bare semantics
to compel these inferences. For even if Jack stands in the wanting
relation to <strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong>, that by itself is
silent on whether he also stands in the wanting relation to
<strong>^(a(sweater))</strong>. Zalta&rsquo;s semantics decides the
matter positively, however. For example, if there is an intentional
object encoding being a woollen sweater, it encodes being a sweater,
so if &lsquo;wants a woollen sweater&rsquo; is true of Jack,
&lsquo;wants a sweater&rsquo; will also be true of him. The analyses
Moltmann and Richard give of intensional transitive relations such as
wanting also support weakening. For example, if in every minimal
situation in which Jack&rsquo;s desire is satisfied, he gets a woollen
sweater, then in every such situation, he gets a sweater; so he wants
a sweater.</p>

<p>
But the intuitive validity of weakening can also be directly
challenged. For example, via weakening we can infer that if A is
looking for a cat and B is looking for a dog, then A and B are looking
for the same thing (an animal). For discussion of this kind of
example, see (Zimmerman 2006), and for the special use of &lsquo;the
same thing&rsquo;, (Moltmann 2013, 95&ndash;120). Asher (1987, 171)
proposes an even more direct counterexample. Suppose you enter a
competition whose prize is a free ticket on the Concorde to New York.
So presumably you <em>want a free ticket</em> on the Concorde. But you
don&rsquo;t <em>want a ticket</em> on the Concorde, since you know
that normally these are very expensive, you are poor, and you strictly
resist desiring the unattainable. Asher is here assimilating notional
uses of indefinites to generics, which on his account involve
quantification over <em>normal</em> worlds. So if for some bizarre
reason you want a sloop, but one whose hull is riddled with holes, it
will not be literally true to say you want a sloop.</p>

<p>
Undeniably there is a real phenomenon here, but perhaps it belongs to
pragmatics rather than semantics. If I say &lsquo;I want a
sloop&rsquo;, someone who offers to buy me any sloop floating in the
harbor could reasonably complain &lsquo;You should have said
that&rsquo; if I decline the offer on the grounds that none of those
sloops meets my unstated requirement of having a hull riddled with
holes. And my aspirational benefactor&rsquo;s complaint would be
justified if normality is a <em>default implicature</em> or
presupposition that a co-operative speaker is under some obligation to
let her audience know isn&rsquo;t in force, when it isn&rsquo;t. It is
still literally true, on this view, that you want a sloop, despite the
idiosyncrasy of the details of your desire. However, this is far from
the end of the story. Those with doubts about weakening will find the
discussion in Sainsbury 2018(129&ndash;133) congenial.</p>

<p>
Another interesting logical problem concerns the &ldquo;conjunctive
force&rdquo; of disjoined quantified NPs in objectual ascriptions.
There is a large literature on the conjunctive force of disjunction in
many other contexts (e.g., Kamp 1973, Loewer 1976, Makinson 1984,
Jennings 1994, Zimmerman 2000, Simons 2005, Fox 2007, Forbes 2014),
for instance as exhibited in &lsquo;<em>x</em> is larger than
<em>y</em> or <em>z</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;John can speak to you in
French or in Italian&rsquo;. In these cases the conjunctive force is
easily captured by simple distribution: &lsquo;<em>x</em> is larger
than <em>y</em> and larger than <em>z</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;John can
speak to you in French and can speak to you in
 Italian&rsquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 However, with intensional transitives we find the same conjunctive
force, but no distributive articulation. If we say that Jack needs a
woollen sweater or a fleece jacket, we say something to the effect
that (i) his getting a woollen sweater is a way his need could be met,
<em>and</em> (ii) his getting a fleece jacket is a way his need could
be met. But &lsquo;Jack needs a woollen sweater or a fleece
jacket&rsquo; does <em>not</em> mean that Jack needs a woollen sweater
<em>and</em> needs a fleece jacket. This last conjunction ascribes two
needs, only one of which can be met by getting a woollen sweater. But
the latter acquisition by itself can meet a disjunctive need for a
woollen sweater or a fleece jacket. So there is a challenge to explain
the semantics of the disjunctive ascription, while at the same time
remaining within a framework that can accommodate all cases of
conjunctive force &mdash; comparatives, various senses of
&lsquo;can&rsquo;, counterfactuals with disjunctive antecedents
(&ldquo;if Jack were to put on a woollen sweater or a fleece jacket
he&rsquo;d be warmer&rdquo;) and so on; see further (Forbes 2006,
97&ndash;111).</p>

<p>
A penultimate type of inference we will mention is one in which
intensional and extensional verbs both occur, and the inference seems
valid even when the intensional VPs are construed unspecifically. An
example:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(23a)</dt>
<dd>Jack wants a woollen sweater</dd>
<dt>(23b)</dt>
<dd>Whatever Jack wants, he gets</dd>
<dt>(23c)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, Jack will get a woollen sweater</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Obviously, (23a,b) entail (23c) when (23a) is understood specifically.
But informants judge that the inference is also valid when (23a) is
understood unspecifically, with &lsquo;but no particular one&rsquo;
explicitly appended. If we seek a validation of the inference that
hews to surface form, Montague&rsquo;s uniform treatment of
intensional and extensional verbs has its appeal: (23b) will say that
for whatever property of properties <strong><em>P</em></strong> Jack
stands in the wanting relation to, he stands in the getting relation
to. So the inference is portrayed as the simple <em>modus ponens</em>
it seems to be. It would then be the task of other meaning-postulates
to carry us from his standing in the getting relation to
<strong>^(a(woollen(sweater)))</strong> to there being a woollen
sweater such that he gets it.</p> The final example to be considered
here involves fictional or mythical names in the scope of intensional
transitives. An example (Zalta 1988, 128) of the puzzles these can
lead to is:

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(24a)</dt>
<dd>The ancient Greeks worshipped Zeus.</dd>
<dt>(24b)</dt>
<dd>Zeus is a mythical character.</dd>
<dt>(24c)</dt>
<dd>Mythical characters do not exist.</dd>
<dt>(24d)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, the ancient Greeks worshipped something that does (did)
not exist.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Or even:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(24e)</dt>
<dd>Therefore, there is something that doesn&rsquo;t exist such that
the ancient Greeks worshipped it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
One thing the example shows is that specific/unspecific is not to be
confused with real/fictional. (24a) is a true specific ascription,
just as &lsquo;the ancient Greeks worshipped Ahura Mazda&rsquo; is a
false one. (24b) is also true. So the ancient Greeks, who would not
have <em>knowingly</em> worshipped a mythical character, were making a
large, if common, mistake.</p>

<p>
(24c) is also true, if we are careful about what &lsquo;do not
exist&rsquo; means in this context. It is contingent that Zeus-myths
were ever formulated, and one sense in which we might mean (24c) turns
on the assumption that fictional and mythical characters exist iff
fictions and myths about them do. In this sense, (24c) is false,
though an actual fictional character such as Zeus would not have
existed if there had been no Zeus-myths. This also explains why (24a)
and (24b) can both be true: &lsquo;Zeus&rsquo; refers to the mythical
character, a contingently existing abstract object.</p>

<p>
However, by far the more likely reading of (24c) is one on which it
means that mythical characters are not real. Zeus is not flesh and
blood, not even godlike flesh and blood. With this in mind, (24d) and
(24e) are both true. The quantifier &lsquo;something&rsquo; ranges
over a domain that includes both real and fictional or mythical
entities, and there is something in that domain, the mythical
character, which was worshipped by the ancient Greeks and which is not
in the subdomain of real items.</p>

<p>
This gets the right truth-values for the statements in (24), but might
be thought to run into trouble with the likes of &lsquo;Zeus lives on
Mt. Olympus&rsquo;: if &lsquo;Zeus&rsquo; refers to an abstract
object, how can Zeus live anywhere? One way of dealing with this kind
of case is to suppose, evidently plausibly, that someone who says
&lsquo;Zeus lives on Mt. Olympus&rsquo; and knows the facts means</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(25)</dt>
<dd>According to the myth, Zeus lives on Mt. Olympus.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
On the other hand, if an ancient Greek believer says &lsquo;Zeus lives
on Mt. Olympus&rsquo;, he or she says something that isn&rsquo;t true,
there being no reason to posit a covert &lsquo;according to the
myth&rsquo; in this case.</p>

<p>
However, even the covert operator theory might be contested, on the
grounds that within its scope we are still unintelligibly predicating
&lsquo;lived on Mt. Olympus&rsquo; of an abstract object. Simply
prefixing &lsquo;according to the myth&rsquo; to the unintelligible
cannot render it intelligible. But there is the evident fact that (25)
is both intelligible and true. So either prefixing &lsquo;according to
the myth&rsquo; <em>can</em> render the unintelligible intelligible,
perhaps by being metalinguistic, or what is going on in the embedded
sentence is not to be construed as standard predication. Further
discussion of these matters may be found in, for example, van Inwagen
1977, Parsons 1980, Zalta 1988, Thomasson 1998, and Salmon 2002.</p>
