<h1>Rights</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Dec 19, 2005; substantive revision Sat Jun 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Rights are entitlements (not) to perform certain actions, or (not) to
be in certain states; or entitlements that others (not) perform
certain actions or (not) be in certain states.</p>

<p>
Rights dominate modern understandings of what actions are permissible
and which institutions are just. Rights structure the form of
governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as many
now see it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of
freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may,
must, and must not be done.</p>

<p>
This entry begins by describing the nature of rights: their
classification, their composition, and their function. It then reviews
the history of the language of rights, and various relationships
between rights and reasons. The major contemporary philosophical
approaches to the justification of rights are compared, and the entry
concludes by surveying criticisms of rights and &ldquo;rights
talk&rdquo;. The focus throughout is on general theoretical issues
(what rights are) and not on arguments over specific rights (what
rights there are). Those looking for fuller introductions to rights
may consider Jones 1994, Harel 2005, Campbell 2006, Ivison 2008, and
Edmundson 2012.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="CatRig">1. Categories of Rights</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to
strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate
a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel
proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender
to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to castle kingside, to a
distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one&rsquo;s eyes, to
pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell
in one&rsquo;s own way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We encounter assertions of rights as we encounter sounds: persistently
and in great variety. To make sense of this profusion of assertions we
can class rights together by common attributes. Rights can be
categorized, for example, according to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Who</em> is alleged to have the right: Human rights,
children&rsquo;s rights, animal rights, workers&rsquo; rights,
states&rsquo; rights, the rights of peoples.</p>

<p>
<em>What</em> <em>actions</em> or <em>states</em> or <em>objects</em>
the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass
judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily
rights.</p>

<p>
<em>Why</em> the right-holder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights
are grounded in moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of
the society, customary rights exist by local convention.</p>

<p>
<em>How the asserted right can be affected</em> by the
right-holder&rsquo;s actions: The inalienable right to life, the
forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be
kept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many of these categories have sub-categories. For instance, natural
rights are the sub-class of moral rights that humans have because of
their nature. Or again, the rights of political speech are a subclass
of the rights of free expression.</p>

<p>
The study of particular rights is primarily an investigation into how
such categories and sub-categories overlap. There has been much
discussion, for example, of whether human rights are natural rights,
whether the right to privacy is a legal right, and whether the legal
right to life is a forfeitable right. (For the central jurisprudential
debate over the relation between legal and moral rights, see entries
on
 <a href="../legal-positivism/">legal positivism</a>,
 <a href="../natural-law-theories/">natural law theories</a>, and
 <a href="../lawphil-nature/">the nature of law</a>.)
 Sometimes theorists will also do analytical work on a single
subcategory: for example, Steiner (2013) questions whether inalienable
or unwaivable rights are logically possible, and Andersson (2013)
discusses who moral right-holders are, and M. Gilbert (2018) focuses
on justifying what she calls &ldquo;demand-rights&rdquo;, which give
the right-holder standing to demand its object.</p>

<h2 id="AnaRig">2. The Analysis of Rights</h2>

<p>
Categorization sorts the profusion of rights assertions. To understand
the exact meaning of any assertion of a right, we need to understand
more precisely how rights are constructed and what they do.</p>

<p>
An analysis of rights has two parts: a description of the internal
structure of rights (their form), and a description of what rights do
for those who hold them (their function). The Hohfeldian analysis of
the form of rights is widely accepted, although there are scholarly
quarrels about its details. Which theory gives the best account of the
distinctive function of rights has been much more contentious; we turn
to that debate in
 <a href="#HisLanRig">section 3</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="ForRigHohAnaSys">2.1 The Form of Rights: The Hohfeldian Analytical System</h3>

<p>
Analysis reveals that most familiar rights, such as the right to free
expression or the right of private property, have a complex internal
structure. Such rights are ordered arrangements of basic components,
much in the same way that most molecules are ordered arrangements of
chemical elements. The four basic components of rights are known as
&ldquo;the Hohfeldian incidents&rdquo; after Wesley Hohfeld
(1879&ndash;1918), the American legal theorist who discovered them.
These four basic &ldquo;elements&rdquo; are the privilege, the claim,
the power, and the immunity. Each of these Hohfeldian incidents has a
distinctive logical form, and the incidents fit together in
characteristic ways to create complex &ldquo;molecular&rdquo; rights.
Once one knows the Hohfeldian system, one can analyze precisely what
any assertion of a right might mean.</p>

<h4 id="PriLib">2.1.1 Privileges (or Liberties)</h4>

<p>
You have a right to pick up a shell that you find on the beach. This
right is a privilege:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>A</em> has a privilege to &phi; <em>if and only if</em> <em>A</em>
has no duty not to &phi;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To say that you have a right to pick up the shell is to say that you
have <em>no duty not</em> to pick it up. You will not be violating any
duty not to pick up the shell should you decide to do so. Similarly,
your right to sit in an empty seat in the cinema, and your right to
paint your bedroom red, are also privileges. Privilege-rights mark out
what their bearer has no duty not to do. When US Presidents invoke
&ldquo;executive privilege&rdquo;, they are denying that they have a
duty not to withhold evidence: they assert a Hohfeldian privilege.
Similarly, a license (to drive, to perform surgery, to kill) endows
its holder with a privilege to engage in the licensed activity. The
holder of a driver&rsquo;s license has a privilege&mdash;no duty
not&mdash;to operate (specified kinds of) motor vehicles (in
particular ways).</p>

<p>
(Some writers on rights have preferred to speak of
&ldquo;liberties&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;privileges&rdquo; (e.g.,
Steiner 1994: 59&ndash;60). Others have given these two terms
different definitions (e.g., Thomson 1990: 53&ndash;55). To avoid
confusion, this entry will always use &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; and
never &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; to refer to the incident defined
above.)</p>

<h4 id="Cla">2.1.2 Claims</h4>

<p>
A contract between employer and employee confers on the employee a
right to be paid her wages. This right is a claim:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>A</em> has a claim that <em>B</em> &phi; <em>if and only if</em>
<em>B</em> has a duty to <em>A</em> to &phi;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The employee has a claim that the employer pays her her wages, which
means that the employer has a duty to the employee to pay those wages.
As seen in the definition and the example, every claim-right
correlates to a duty in (at least) one duty-bearer. What is
distinctive about the claim-right is that a duty-bearer&rsquo;s duty
is &ldquo;directed at&rdquo; or &ldquo;owed to&rdquo; the
right-holder. What explains the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; of directed
duties has been the subject of controversy, discussed in
 <a href="#DirDut">section 2.2.3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Some claim-rights exist independently of voluntary actions like
signing a contract; and some claim-rights correspond to duties in more
than one agent. For example, a child&rsquo;s claim-right against abuse
exists independently of anyone&rsquo;s actions, and the child&rsquo;s
claim-right correlates to a duty in every other person not to abuse
them (in legal terms, the claim-right is <em>in rem</em>). This
example of the child&rsquo;s right also illustrates how some
claim-rights can require duty-bearers to <em>refrain</em> from
performing some action (i.e., that &ldquo;phi&rdquo; can be a negative
verb such as &ldquo;not abuse him&rdquo;). Bodily rights and property
rights are paradigmatic rights with claim-rights at their core.</p>

<h4 id="Pow">2.1.3 Powers</h4>

<p>
Privileges and claims define what Hart called &ldquo;primary
rules&rdquo;: rules requiring that people perform or refrain from
performing particular actions (Hart 1961). Indeed, the primary rules
for all physical actions are properly analyzed as privileges and
claims. Were we to know all privileges and claims concerning physical
actions, we would know for every possible physical action whether that
action was permitted, required, or forbidden.</p>

<p>
Two further Hohfeldian incidents define what Hart called
&ldquo;secondary rules&rdquo;: rules that specify how agents can
introduce and change primary rules.</p>

<p>
The Hohfeldian power is the incident that enables agents to alter
primary rules:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>A</em> has a power <em>if and only if</em> <em>A</em> has the
ability to alter her own or another&rsquo;s Hohfeldian incidents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A ship&rsquo;s captain has the power-right to order a midshipman to
scrub the deck. The captain&rsquo;s exercise of this power changes the
sailor&rsquo;s normative situation: it imposes a new duty upon the
sailor and so annuls one of the sailor&rsquo;s Hohfeldian privileges
(not to scrub the deck). Similarly, a promisor exercises a power-right
to create in the promisee a claim that the promisor will perform a
certain action. The promisor&rsquo;s exercise of her power-right to
promise creates in the promisee a claim that the promisor do what she
promised to do. Or again, a neighbor waives his claim that you not
enter his property by inviting you into his home, thus endowing you
with a corresponding privilege. Ordering, promising, waiving,
abandoning, consenting, selling, and sentencing are all examples of
acts by which a right-holder exercises a power to change his own
Hohfeldian incidents or those of another.</p>

<p>
Powers can alter not only &ldquo;first-order&rdquo; privileges and
claims, but &ldquo;higher-order&rdquo; incidents as well (Sumner 1987:
31). An admiral, for example, has the power-right to relieve a captain
of her power-right to command a ship. Power-rights to alter the
authority of others are, as we will see, definitive of all developed
legal and political systems.</p>

<h4 id="Imm">2.1.4 Immunities</h4>

<p>
The fourth and final Hohfeldian incident is the immunity. When
<em>A</em> has the ability to alter <em>B</em>&rsquo;s Hohfeldian
incidents, then <em>A</em> has a power. When <em>A</em> <em>lacks</em>
the ability to alter <em>B</em>&rsquo;s Hohfeldian incidents, then B
has an immunity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>B</em> has an immunity <em>if and only if</em> <em>A</em> lacks
the ability to alter <em>B</em>&rsquo;s Hohfeldian incidents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The United States Congress lacks the ability within the Constitution
to impose upon American citizens a duty to kneel daily before a cross.
Since the Congress lacks a power, the citizens have an immunity. This
immunity is a core element of an American citizen&rsquo;s right to
religious freedom. Similarly, witnesses in court have a right not to
be ordered to incriminate themselves, and civil servants have a right
not to be dismissed when a new government comes to power. All of these
rights are immunities, corresponding to an absence of a power in some
other party to alter the right-holder&rsquo;s normative situation in
some way.</p>

<h4 id="OppCor">2.1.5 Opposites and Correlatives</h4>

<p>
Hohfeld arranged the four incidents in tables of
&ldquo;opposites&rdquo; and &ldquo;correlatives&rdquo; so as to
display the logical structure of his system. In order to fill out the
tables he added some further terminology. For instance, if a person
<em>A</em> has a claim, then <em>A</em> lacks a &ldquo;no-claim&rdquo;
(a no-claim is the opposite of a claim). And if a person <em>A</em>
has a power, then some person <em>B</em> has a &ldquo;liability&rdquo;
(a liability is the correlative of a power).</p>

<table class="indent">

<h4 id="MolRig">2.1.6 Molecular Rights</h4>

<p>
Each of the &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; incidents&mdash;the privilege, claim,
power, and immunity&mdash;can be a right when it occurs in isolation.
And as mentioned above these atomic incidents also bond together in
characteristic ways to form complex rights. Following, for example, is
part of the &ldquo;molecular&rdquo; structure of the property right
that you have over your computer:</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig1">
<img alt="mostly described in the body but a link to an extended description below" src="figure.svg" style="width:30em" />

<p class="center">
Part of the &ldquo;Molecular&rdquo; Structure of a Property Right [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig1">extended description of this figure</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
In the figure, the &ldquo;first-order&rdquo; rights are your legal
rights directly over your property&mdash;in this case, your computer.
The privilege on this first level entitles you to use your computer.
The claim correlates to a duty in every other person not to use your
computer.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;second-order&rdquo; rights are your legal rights concerning
the alteration of these first-order rights. You have several powers
with respect to your claim&mdash;you may waive the claim (granting
others permission to touch the computer), annul the claim (abandoning
the computer as your property), or transfer the claim (making the
computer into someone else&rsquo;s property). Also on the second
order, your immunity prevents others from altering your first-order
claim over your computer. Your immunity, that is, prevents others from
waiving, annulling, or transferring your claim over your computer. The
four incidents together constitute a significant portion of your
property right.</p>

<p>
Of course all of these incidents are qualified: you have no privilege
to use your computer as a weapon, or to use your computer to hack into
someone else&rsquo;s machine; and your immunity may not entirely block
out the state&rsquo;s power of expropriation (if for example the
computer becomes evidence in a criminal case). These qualifications to
the incidents carve the contours of your property right, but they do
not affect its basic shape.</p>

<p>
There may also be more incidents associated with ownership than shown
in the figure above. Carl Wellman (1985, 1995) describes each right as
having a &ldquo;defining core&rdquo; surrounded by &ldquo;associated
elements&rdquo; which may be present or absent in a particular case.
Your property right, for instance, may also be protected by a
qualified third-order immunity against the government altering your
second-order rights over your property (for example, under the
&ldquo;Takings Clause&rdquo; of the Fifth Amendment to the US
Constitution the government cannot simply annul your right to sell a
parcel of your land).</p>

<h4 id="ActPasRig">2.1.7 Active and Passive Rights</h4>

<p>
The distinction between active and passive rights (Lyons 1970) maps
neatly onto the Hohfeldian incidents. The privilege and the power are
&ldquo;active&rdquo; rights that concern their holders&rsquo; own
actions. The claim and the immunity are &ldquo;passive&rdquo; rights
that regulate the actions of others. Active rights are signaled by
statements of the form &ldquo;<em>A</em> has a right to &phi;&rdquo;;
while passive rights are signaled by statements of the form
&ldquo;<em>A</em> has a right that <em>B</em> &phi;&rdquo; (in both of
these formulas, &ldquo;&phi;&rdquo; is an active verb).</p>

<p>
A naval captain has an (active) privilege-right to walk the decks and
an (active) power-right to order that the ship set sail. A player in a
chess tournament has a (passive) claim-right that their opponent not
distract them, and a professor has a (passive) immunity-right that her
university not fire them for publishing unpopular views.</p>

<h4 id="NegPosRig">2.1.8 Negative and Positive Rights</h4>

<p>
A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among
some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward
libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to
non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to
provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a
classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare
assistance is a prototypical positive right (Narveson 1988
[2001]).</p>

<p>
Since both negative and positive rights are passive rights, some
rights are neither negative nor positive. Privileges and powers cannot
be negative rights; and privileges, powers, and immunities cannot be
positive rights. The (privilege-) right to enter a building, and the
(power-) right to enter into a binding agreement, are neither negative
nor positive.</p>

<p>
It is sometimes said that negative rights are easier to satisfy than
positive rights. Negative rights can be respected simply by each
person refraining from interfering with each other, while it may be
difficult or even impossible to fulfill everyone&rsquo;s positive
rights if the sum of people&rsquo;s claims outstrips the resources
available.</p>

<p>
However, when it comes to the enforcement of rights, this difference
disappears. Funding a legal system that enforces citizens&rsquo;
negative rights against assault may require more resources than
funding a welfare system that realizes citizens&rsquo; positive rights
to assistance. As Holmes and Sunstein (1999: 43) put it, in the
context of citizens&rsquo; rights to state enforcement, all rights are
positive. Moreover, the point is often made that the moral urgency of
securing positive rights may be just as great as the moral urgency of
securing negative rights (Shue 1980 [1996]). Whatever is the
justificatory basis for ascribing rights&mdash;autonomy, need, or
something else&mdash;there might be just as strong a moral case for
fulfilling a person&rsquo;s right to adequate medical care as there is
for protecting that person&rsquo;s right not to be assaulted.</p>

<p>
Some argue that certain purportedly pre-institutional or
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; positive rights&mdash;such as a natural right to
health care&mdash;cannot be genuine rights because they have no
determinate duty-bearers and entail no determinate duties in the
absence of institutions. For example, against whom do I have a claim
to health care in the absence of institutionalized medical systems?
And what could I justifiably claim in such a &ldquo;state of
nature&rdquo;? By contrast, pre-institutional &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
negative rights&mdash;such as a natural right not to be
assaulted&mdash;still entail clear duties (of non-interference) for
determinate duty-bearers even in the absence of institutions. This
point, originally made by O&rsquo;Neill (1996, 2005), has grounded a
growing body of work on the nature and status of positive human
rights, or as O&rsquo;Neill calls them, human rights to goods and
services. (Tomalty 2014).</p>

<h3 id="FunRigWilTheIntThe">2.2 The Function of Rights: The Will Theory and the Interest Theory</h3>

<h4 id="ConAnaVerDefSti">2.2.1 Conceptual Analysis versus Definitional Stipulation</h4>

<p>
All rights can be represented by Hohfeldian diagrams, like the diagram
of the property right &ldquo;molecule&rdquo; above (Halpin 2017).
However, some diagrams of Hohfeldian incidents that we can construct
do not correspond to any right. To take a simple example from Hart
(1982: 191&ndash;92), your city council lacks the Hohfeldian power to
award you a pension; so by definition you have a Hohfeldian immunity
against your city council awarding you a pension. Yet it would be odd
to say that you have a right against your city council awarding you a
pension. You thus have an immunity, but not a right. Not all
(collections of) Hohfeldian incidents are rights; it is only those
(collections of) Hohfeldian incidents that have a certain
<em>function</em> (or perhaps certain <em>functions</em>) that are
rights. To take an analogy: all engagement rings are rings, but only
rings with a certain function are engagement rings. What, then, is the
function of rights?</p>

<p>
The question of the distinctive function of rights is the question of
what rights do for those who hold them. Before discussing the two
major positions on this issue, we can survey some statements that
theorists have made that may appear to be describing which Hohfeldian
incidents are rights:</p>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;In the strictest sense&rdquo; all rights are claims.
(Hohfeld 1919: 36)</li>

<li>To have a right is to have a &ldquo;valid claim&rdquo;. (Feinberg
1970: 257)</li>

<li>&ldquo;Rights are built around the claims of patients on an
agent&rdquo;. (Walen 2019: 58)</li>

<li>&ldquo;A right, in the most important sense, is the conjunction of
a [privilege] and a claim-right&rdquo;. (Mackie 1979: 169)</li>

<li>&ldquo;Rights are permissions rather than requirements. Rights
tell us what the bearer is at liberty to do&rdquo;. (Louden 1983:
95)</li>

<li>&ldquo;No one ever has a right to do something; he only has a
right that some one else shall do (or refrain from doing)
something&rdquo;. (Williams 1956: 1145 [1968: 125])</li>

<li>&ldquo;A person who says to another &lsquo;I have a right to do
it&rsquo; is not saying that &hellip; it is not wrong to do it. He is
claiming that the other has a duty not to interfere&rdquo;. (Raz 1994:
275)</li>

<li>&ldquo;A right is an established way of acting&rdquo;. (R. Martin
1993: 1)</li>

<li>&ldquo;It is hard to think of rights except as capable of
<em>exercise</em>&rdquo;. (Hart 1982: 185)</li>

<li>&ldquo;A right is a <em>power</em> which a creature ought to
possess&rdquo;. (Plamenatz 1938: 82)</li>

<li>&ldquo;All rights are essentially property rights&rdquo;. (Steiner
1994: 93)</li>

<li>&ldquo;Rights are themselves <em>property</em>, things we
own&rdquo;. (Feinberg 1973: 75)</li>

<li>&ldquo;Rights are generally understood to be valuable
possessions&rdquo;. (M. Gilbert 2018: 6)</li>
</ul>

<p>
At first, this survey might remind one the proverb of the blind men,
each of whom is feeling a different part of an elephant. However, we
should distinguish between two different aims that a theorist might
have when they make a statement of the form &ldquo;All rights are
<em>x</em>&rdquo;. A theorist may be <em>attempting to analyze</em>
the meaning of our ordinary concept of rights, or they may be
<em>stipulating a definition</em> of &ldquo;rights&rdquo; within her
own ethical, political or legal theory.</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, Mill&rsquo;s famous assertion in
<em>Utilitarianism</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we call anything a person&rsquo;s right, we mean that he has a
valid claim on society to protect him in the possession of it, either
by the force of law, or by that of education and opinion&hellip; To
have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society
ought to defend me in the possession of. (Mill 1861 [2002: 54])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As an analysis of the everyday concept of a right, Mill&rsquo;s
assertion would be weak. For example, for centuries many people have
asserted that God has the right to command his creatures; yet
presumably no one who asserts such a right would commit to the idea
that society ought to defend God in the possession of the power to
command. To take another example, there seems nothing incoherent in
the thought that individuals have a right not to be protected by
society; yet this thought could not make sense on Mill&rsquo;s
characterization of what rights are. (On Mill, see also Hart 1982:
100&ndash;04.)</p>

<p>
Mill&rsquo;s statement is better seen not as an analysis of the
everyday concept, but as a stipulative definition of the term
&ldquo;right&rdquo;. Mill stipulates this particular definition
because the idea of &ldquo;those possessive relations that are
valuable enough that it is worthwhile for society to institute
sanctions to protect them&rdquo; is an idea that works well within his
larger utilitarian theory. So where Mill&rsquo;s statement departs
from the common understanding of rights, we should charitably read
Mill as prescribing, instead of describing, usage. Many authors&rsquo;
pronouncements about rights are charitably interpreted as these kinds
of exercises in stipulation, rather than as attempts to analyze the
ordinary concept of rights.</p>

<p>
To take an example from the scholarly literature, it is not uncommon
to encounter a general statement that all rights are (or at least
include) claim-rights (see, e.g., Raz 1986: 166, 173&ndash;75; Steiner
1994: 55; Kramer, Simmonds, &amp; Steiner 1998: 9&ndash;14). These
&ldquo;all rights are claims&rdquo; statements are better interpreted
as stipulative, rather than as analyses of common usage. &ldquo;All
rights are claims&rdquo; positions cannot recognize, for example, the
rights in the Hobbesian state of nature, in which each person has
unlimited privilege-rights of self-defense yet no claim-rights against
attack. Neither could an &ldquo;all rights are claims&rdquo; theory
recognize that the US Constitution gives Congress the sole (power-)
right to declare war. The statement that rights are claims is
prescriptive for, not descriptive of, usage.</p>

<p>
Occasionally a theorist will say that they are presenting neither an
analysis of the ordinary concept of a right, nor merely stipulating a
new meaning for the term &ldquo;right&rdquo;, but are rather offering
some third type of characterization. For instance, Carl Wellman (1995:
136) says that his narrow specification of &ldquo;a right&rdquo; is
needed to provide &ldquo;a clearer and more revealing map of the
law&rdquo;. Raz (1986: 166) frames a contrasting &ldquo;philosophical
definition&rdquo; that, he says, &ldquo;illuminates a tradition of
political and moral discourse in which different theories offer
incompatible views of what rights there are and why&rdquo;. Whether
there is room for such a third category of &ldquo;philosophical
definition&rdquo;, which goes beyond both ordinary analysis and
stipulation, is contested (Wenar 2008).</p>

<h4 id="WilTheIntThe">2.2.2 The Will Theory and the Interest Theory</h4>

<p>
There are two main theories of the function of rights: the will theory
and the interest theory. Each theory presents itself as capturing an
ordinary understanding of what rights do for those who hold them.
Which theory offers the better account of the functions of rights has
been the subject of spirited dispute, literally for ages.</p>

<p>
Will theorists maintain that a right makes the right-holder &ldquo;a
small scale sovereign&rdquo; (Hart 1982: 183). More specifically, a
will theorist asserts that the function of a right is to give its
holder control over another&rsquo;s duty. Your property right
diagrammed in the figure above is a right, says the will theorist,
because it contains a power to waive (or annul, or transfer)
others&rsquo; duties. You are the &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; of your
computer, in that you may permit others to touch it or not at your
discretion. Similarly a promisee is &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; over the
action of the promisor: a promisee has a right because she has the
power to waive (or annul) the promisor&rsquo;s duty to keep the
promise. In Hohfeldian terms, will theorists assert that every right
includes a Hohfeldian power over a claim. In colloquial terms, will
theorists believe that all rights confer control over others&rsquo;
duties to act in particular ways.</p>

<p>
Interest theorists disagree. Interest theorists maintain that the
function of a right is to further the right-holder&rsquo;s interests.
An owner has a right, according to the interest theorist, not because
owners have choices, but because the ownership makes owners better
off. A promisee has a right because promisees have some interest in
the performance of the promise, or (alternatively) some interest in
being able to form voluntary bonds with others (Owens 2012). Your
rights, the interest theorist says, are the Hohfeldian incidents you
have that are good for you.</p>

<p>
The contest between will-based and interest-based theories of the
function of rights has been waged for hundreds of years. Influential
will theorists include Kant, Savigny, Hart, Kelsen, Carl Wellman, and
Steiner. Important interest theorists include Bentham, Ihering,
Austin, Lyons, MacCormick, Raz, and Kramer. Each theory has stronger
and weaker points as an account of what rights do for
right-holders.</p>

<p>
The will theory captures the powerful link between rights and
normative control. To have a right is to have the ability to determine
what others may and may not do, and so to exercise authority over a
certain domain of affairs. The resonant connection between rights and
authority (the authority to control what others may do) is for will
theorists a matter of definition.</p>

<p>
However, the will theory&rsquo;s account of the function of rights
struggles to explain many rights that most think there are. Within the
will theory, there can be no such thing as an unwaivable right: a
right over which its holder has no power. Yet intuitively it would
appear that unwaivable rights are some of the most important rights
that we have: consider, for example, the unwaivable right not to be
enslaved (MacCormick 1977: 197).</p>

<p>
Moreover, since the will theorist holds that all rights confer
sovereignty, she cannot acknowledge that beings incapable of
exercising sovereignty have rights. Within the will theory, it is
impossible for incompetents like infants, animals, and comatose adults
to have rights. Yet we ordinarily would not doubt that these
incompetents can have rights, for example the right not to be tortured
(MacCormick 1982: 154&ndash;66). Attempts to avoid this problem by
maintaining that incapable beings hold rights that confer sovereignty
exercised on their behalf by another (for example, that infants&rsquo;
rights confer sovereignty exercised on the infants&rsquo; behalf by
parents) struggle to provide non-circular accounts of the requisite
concept of &ldquo;sovereignty exercised on behalf of another
right-holder&rdquo; (Cruft 2019: ch. 3). Will theories also have
difficulties explaining bare privilege-rights (such as in the
Hobbesian state of nature), which are not rights of authority over
others.</p>

<p>
The interest theory is more capacious than the will theory. It readily
accommodates both unwaivable rights (the possession of which may be
good for their holders) and the rights of incompetents (who have
interests that rights can protect). The interest theory also taps into
the deeply plausible connection between holding rights and being
better off.</p>

<p>
However, the interest theory is also misaligned with any ordinary
understanding of rights. We commonly accept that people can have
interests in <em>x</em> without having a right to <em>x</em>; and
contrariwise that people can have a right to <em>x</em> without having
interests sufficient to explain this. In the first category are
&ldquo;third party beneficiaries&rdquo; (Lyons 1994, 36&ndash;46). You
may have a powerful interest in the lottery paying out for your
spouse&rsquo;s winning ticket, but you have no right that the lottery
pays out to your spouse. In the second category are many of the rights
of office-holders and role-bearers (Jones 1994: 31&ndash;32; Wenar
2013b). Whatever interest a judge may have in sentencing a convict to
life in prison, the judge&rsquo;s interests cannot justify ascribing
to her the power to make such a dramatic change in the convict&rsquo;s
normative situation.</p>

<p>
The difficulties of the interest theory have often been noted in
Raz&rsquo;s version, which is perhaps the most prominent. In
Raz&rsquo;s account,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>X</em> has a right if <em>X</em> can have rights, and, other
things being equal, an aspect of <em>X</em>&rsquo;s well-being (his
interest) is a sufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to
be under a duty. (Raz 1986: 166)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet there appear to be many rights for which the interests of the
putative right-holder are not sufficient to hold other person(s) to be
under a duty. For example, Raz himself notices that the interest of a
journalist in protecting his sources is not itself sufficient reason
to hold others to be under a duty not to pressure the journalist to
reveal his sources (Raz 1986: 179, 247&ndash;8). Raz says that it is
rather the interests of the general public in an active and
independent media that grounds the journalist&rsquo;s right to protect
his sources. Yet as Kamm then objects to Raz,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the satisfaction of interests of others is the reason why the
journalist gets a right to have his interest protected, his interest
is <em>not sufficient</em> to give rise to the duty of noninterference
with his speech. (Kamm 2002: 485; for defenses of Raz, see
Pallikkathayil 2016, Mullins 2019)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nor does this difficulty only affect the rights of office-holders like
journalists; Raz admits that weighty rights such as the rights of free
expression and freedom of contract are not justified solely by the
interests of the individual citizens who hold them, but also by the
ways that these rights further the common good (Raz 1994: 30&ndash;43,
131). Or again, parents may have the right to receive child benefit
payments from the state, but here only the interests of the children,
and not the interests of the parents, could be sufficient to hold the
state to be under a duty (see also May 2012, 2015).</p>

<p>
Raz&rsquo;s version of the interest theory continues to be the most
widely-cited account of the function of rights, despite such concerns
that are now commonplace in the specialist literature. Kramer&rsquo;s
version of the interest theory is the major contemporary alternative:
it maintains that although a given right need not be grounded or
justified by its holders&rsquo; interests, it must necessarily do for
the right-holder something that would typically be in the interests of
a party of the right-holder&rsquo;s type (person, animal, group)
(Kramer 2013, 2017, 2024).</p>

<p>
Will theorists and interest theorists have developed their positions
with increasing technical sophistication. The issues that divide the
two camps are clearly defined, and the debates between them are often
intense (Kramer, Simmonds, &amp; Steiner 1998; Van Duffel 2012a;
Kramer 2013; McBride 2017a; Frydrych 2018; Bowen 2020). The seemingly
interminable debate between these two major theories has driven some
to conclude that the debate itself rests on the mistaken premise that
there is a single concept of a right for which these theories provide
rival analyses (Van Duffel 2012b; Hayward 2013; Valentini 2023). The
deadlock has encouraged other theorists to develop alternative
positions on the function of rights.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Demand&rdquo; theories fill out the idea that, as Feinberg
(1973: 58&ndash;59) puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A right is something a man can stand on, something that can be
demanded or insisted upon without embarrassment or shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Darwall (2006: 18), to have a claim-right,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
includes a second-personal authority to resist, complain, remonstrate,
and perhaps use coercive measures of other kinds, including, perhaps,
to gain compensation if the right is violated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On Skorupski&rsquo;s account (2010: XII.6, XIV.2&ndash;3) rights
specify what the right-holder may demand of others, where
&ldquo;demand&rdquo; implies the permissibility of compelling
performance or exacting compensation for non-performance. Like the
will theory, these demand theories center on the agency of the
right-holder. They do not turn on the right-holder&rsquo;s power over
the duty of another, so they do not share the will theory&rsquo;s
difficulty with unwaivable rights. They may, however, have more
difficulties in explaining power-rights. Demand theories also share
the will-theory&rsquo;s challenges in explaining the rights of parties
incapable of demanding, and in explaining privilege-rights.</p>

<p>
M. Gilbert (2018) develops not a demand theory of rights, but a theory
of a special class of rights that she calls
&ldquo;demand-rights&rdquo;. In her formulation, &ldquo;<em>X</em> has
a demand-right against <em>Y</em> if and only if <em>X</em> has the
standing to demand of <em>Y</em> that <em>Y</em> &phi;&rdquo; (2018:
70). Gilbert&rsquo;s paradigm of a demand-right is a promissory right:
the promisee has the standing to demand performance from the promisor,
meaning that the promisee has the authority to demand that the
promisor do what she promised to do. M. Gilbert (2014) explains this
standing to demand in terms of her theory of joint commitment.</p>

<p>
Other analyses of what rights do for right-holders are varied. Scanlon
(2003, 2013) defends the position that rights are constraints on the
discretion of individuals or institutions to act. Sreenivasan (2005,
2010) puts forward a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; analysis of the claim-right
that grafts the interest theory onto the will theory: here the
function of the claim-right is to endow the right-holder with the
amount of control over another&rsquo;s duty that advances her
interests. Wenar (2005) abandons the idea that all rights have any
single function, and develops a &ldquo;several functions&rdquo; theory
on which rights perform six distinct functions. Wenar (2013b) then
sets out a &ldquo;kind desire&rdquo; theory of claim-rights, which
turns on what role-bearers like journalists and parents want as such,
and more generally on what beings (like humans) want <em lang="la">qua</em>
the kinds of beings that they are. Setiya (2025)
sets out an alternative &ldquo;valid consent&rdquo; theory of moral
claim-rights, which aims to explain (where interest, will and demand
theories do not) what he calls the &ldquo;Reciprocity
Thesis&rdquo;&mdash;the thesis that when <em>A</em> has a moral
claim-right that <em>B</em> &phi;, <em>B</em> therefore has no moral
claim-right against being made to &phi; by <em>A</em>, <em lang="la">ceteris
paribus</em>.</p>

<p>
Scanlon&rsquo;s analysis is criticized in M. Gilbert 2004, Wenar
2013a; Sreenivasan&rsquo;s and Wenar&rsquo;s analyses are critiqued in
Kramer and Steiner 2007, and May 2012. Kramer&rsquo;s,
Sreenivasan&rsquo;s and Wenar&rsquo;s theories are criticized and
developed in essays by Kramer, May, Penner, Sreenivasan, McBride, and
Cruft in McBride 2017a; Cruft&rsquo;s theory is critiqued in May 2022;
Kramer&rsquo;s theory is modified in Kurki 2018; Wenar&rsquo;s theory
is defended in Schaab 2018.</p>

<h4 id="DirDut">2.2.3 The Direction of a Duty</h4>

<p>
Recently, theorists have attempted to make progress on the question of
the function of rights by scrutinizing the claim-right in particular,
and by shifting attention onto the duty that corresponds to it. On the
standard account what is distinctive about the claim-right is that a
duty-bearer&rsquo;s duty is &ldquo;directed at&rdquo; or &ldquo;owed
to&rdquo; the right-holder. (The promisor, for example, owes a duty of
performance to the promisee.) Yet what could account for the
directionality of such &ldquo;directed duties&rdquo;? (May 2015)</p>

<p>
After all, not all duties are directed to specific others. For
example, the moral duty of affluent people to give some of their
wealth to charity is not owed to any specific person. And
&ldquo;directed duties&rdquo; appear to have special normative
significance. The violation of any duty may be <em>wrong</em> (it may
be wrong for a rich person to give nothing to charity). But the
violation of a directed duty is more than just a wrong: it is <em>a
wronging</em> of the being to whom the duty is owed (Thompson 2004).
And unlike a mere wrong, the wronging of some being calls, <em lang="la">ceteris
paribus</em>, for apology and compensation. Cruft
(2013) further argues that the violation of any duty owed to a being
is disrespectful of that being. The question is what could possibly
account for the extra significance of the duties that have
direction.</p>

<p>
Darwall (2012) asserts that his second-personal theory of morality
best explains the relation between duty-bearer and right-holder. Cruft
(2019) argues that the directed duty-bearer is required by the form of
her duty to conceive of the right-holder second-personally, as
&ldquo;you, on whom I act&rdquo;; this approach is criticized in Bowen
2022, May 2022, Fornaroli 2021.</p>

<p>
Cornell (2015) argues against the commonly accepted thesis that one
can wrong only those to whom one has directed duties, maintaining for
example that someone who overhears a lie and comes to harm through
acting on this is wronged by the lie even though the liar did not owe
to them her duty to speak honestly. For critical discussion, see
Fornaroli 2025, which is part of a body of new work emerging on
directed duties and the relation between rights and
&ldquo;directedness&rdquo;, including Hedahl 2013, May 2015, Schaab
2018, Fornaroli 2021, Zylberman 2016, Kamm 2022. For the related claim
that some directed duties&mdash;those central to personal
relationships&mdash;do not correlate with rights, see A. Martin
2021.</p>

<h2 id="HisLanRig">3. The History of the Language of Rights</h2>

<p>
Intellectual historians have disputed the origins of rights. These
debates are sometimes framed in terms of when &ldquo;the concept of a
right&rdquo; emerged. Yet insofar as it is really the emergence of the
<em>concept</em> of a right that is at issue, the answer lies beyond
the competence of the intellectual historian and within the domain of
the anthropologist. Even the most primitive social order must include
rules specifying that certain individuals or groups have special
permission to perform certain actions. Moreover, even the most
rudimentary human communities must have rules specifying that some are
entitled to tell others what they must do. Such rules ascribe rights:
privileges and powers respectively. The genesis of the concept of a
right was simultaneous with reflective awareness of such social norms,
however our forebears decided to describe those norms.</p>

<p>
The more productive characterization of the debate within intellectual
history concerns when a <em>word</em> (or phrase) appeared that has a
meaning close to the meaning of our modern word. This debate turns on
when in history the pre-modern &ldquo;objective&rdquo; sense of
&ldquo;right&rdquo; came also to bear our modern,
&ldquo;subjective&rdquo; sense of &ldquo;a right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right&rdquo; in its older, objective sense means &ldquo;what is
just&rdquo; or &ldquo;what is fair&rdquo; (Finnis 1980: 206).
Aristotle uses <em lang="grc">dikaion</em>, for example, to indicate
that a society is &ldquo;rightly ordered&rdquo;: that it displays the
correct structure of human relationships. &ldquo;Right&rdquo; in this
objective sense can also be attributed to individuals. The Roman
jurist Ulpian, for instance, held that justice means rendering each
their right (<em lang="la">ius</em>). In this sense, a person&rsquo;s
&ldquo;right&rdquo; is what is due to him given his role or status.
This objective sense of &ldquo;right&rdquo; is not the same as our
modern idea of &ldquo;a right&rdquo;. For instance, Ulpian noted that
the <em lang="la">ius</em> of a parricide was to be sewn into a sack
of snakes and tossed into the Tiber (Tierney 1997: 16).</p>

<p>
There has been a long and divisive scholarly inquiry into when our
modern, subjective sense of &ldquo;a right&rdquo; became established
as a meaning of some word or phrase. The history is uncertain partly
because the ancient authors often used words imprecisely, and smeared
their meanings across and beyond the Hohfeldian categories. The
intellectual historians themselves have occasionally congested the
discussion by taking different features of rights as definitive of the
modern concept. Moreover, the scholarly debate has sometimes accepted
over-optimistic assumptions about the sharpness of conceptual
boundaries.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, two broad trends in the scholarly discussions have
emerged. The first is to push the origins of a term indicating a
modern, subjective sense of &ldquo;a right&rdquo; back further into
history: from Locke to Hobbes to Grotius in the seventeenth century,
then to Gerson in the fifteenth century, then to Ockham in the
fourteenth, perhaps even to Gratian in the twelfth (Brett 1997;
Tierney 1997; Siedentop 2014; Lisska &amp; Tierney 2015). Donahue
(2010) even argues that <em lang="la">ius</em> is used in a subjective
sense throughout the works of the classical Roman jurists in the first
century BCE to the third century CE; Miller (1996) finds subjective
rights already in Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em>.</p>

<p>
The second and related trend has been to establish that terms
referring to active rights (what we would call privilege-rights and
power-rights) predate terms referring to passive rights (what we would
call claim-rights and immunity-rights). It appears that the earliest
medieval debates using recognizably modern rights-language, for
instance, concerned topics such as whether the pope has a (power-)
right to rule an earthly empire, and whether the poor have a
(privilege-) right to take what they need from the surplus of the
rich.</p>

<h2 id="RigFre">4. Rights and Freedom</h2>

<p>
Most rights entitle their holders to freedom in some sense; indeed
holding a right can entail that one is free in one or more of a
variety of senses. In the most general terms, the active
incidents&mdash;the privilege and the power&mdash;entitle their
holders to <em>freedom to</em> act in certain ways. The passive
incidents&mdash;the claim and the immunity&mdash;often entitle their
holders to <em>freedom from</em> undesirable actions or states.</p>

<p>
We can be more specific. A single privilege-right makes its holder
&ldquo;free to&rdquo; in the sense of non-forbiddenness. A spy with a
security clearance, for instance, may have a privilege-right that
means they are free to enter a highly classified facility of their own
government. One can be free in this non-forbidden way without having
the physical ability to do what one is free to do. The spy, for
instance, still has &ldquo;no duty not&rdquo; to enter the classified
facility even when they are languishing in a distant foreign prison.
The actions that one is free to do in this sense may or may not be
physically possible for one at the moment, but at least they are not
disallowed by the relevant norms (Steiner 1994).</p>

<p>
Someone who has a pair of privilege rights&mdash;no duty to perform
the action, no duty not to perform the action&mdash;is free in an
additional sense of having discretion over whether to perform the
action or not. For example, you may be free to join a protest march,
or not, as you like. This dual non-forbiddenness again does not imply
physical ability. A right-holder may be permitted to perform or not
perform some action, but this still does not mean that she is capable
of performing the action that she is free to perform.</p>

<p>
In contrast, the holder of a power-right does have an ability. This is
the <em>normative</em> ability to exercise authority in a certain way
(Sumner 1987: 28). This normative ability confers freedom in a
different sense. A judge is free to sentence a convicted criminal to
prison. The judge is not merely allowed to sentence the prisoner: her
power-right gives her the ability&mdash;that is, the
authority&mdash;to do so. Her (power-) right makes her free to
sentence in a way that non-judges are not free to sentence.</p>

<p>
As for the passive rights, many claim-rights entitle their holders to
be free from the physical interference or surveillance of others.
Other claim-rights entitle their holders to be free from undesirable
conditions like hunger or fear. Immunity-rights parallel claim-rights
one level up. Immunity-rights make their holders free from the
authority of others, and so entitle their holders to be free from
conditions like tyranny or exploitation.</p>

<p>
A legal system can be seen as a distribution of all of these varieties
of freedom. Any legal system will set out rules specifying who is free
to act in which ways, and who should be free from which unwanted
actions and conditions. A developed legal system will also determine
who has the authority (and so who is free) to interpret and enforce
these rules.</p>

<p>
More generally, any political constitution can be seen as a
multi-leveled structure of rights that distributes authority over
rules of conduct in a distinctive way. A democratic constitution, for
example, may give voters the power to elect legislators, who have
certain powers to enact laws, which the judiciary has certain powers
to interpret, and the police have certain powers to enforce, leaving
certain courses of conduct open as legal for citizens to pursue. The
facts about who should be free to do what within any legal or
political system, as well as the facts about who should be free from
which actions and conditions, can be represented as complex, layered
structures of rights&mdash;exponentially more complex than in the
diagram of the property right above.</p>

<h2 id="RigRea">5. Rights and Reasons</h2>

<h3 id="RigTru">5.1 Rights as Trumps</h3>

<p>
Though there are disputes over the function of rights and the history
of rights language, most agree that rights have special normative
force. The reasons that rights provide are distinctively powerful or
weighty reasons, which override reasons of some other sorts.
Dworkin&rsquo;s metaphor is of rights as &ldquo;trumps&rdquo; (Dworkin
1984). Rights permit their holders to act in certain ways, or give
reasons to treat their holders in certain ways or permit their holders
to act in certain ways, even if some social aim would be served by
doing otherwise. As Mill wrote of the trumping power of the right to
free expression: &ldquo;If all mankind minus one were of one opinion,
mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than
he, if he had the power, would be in silencing mankind&rdquo; (Mill
1859 [1989: 20]).</p>

<p>
But whatever &ldquo;trumping&rdquo; character is essential to all
rights, it must be compatible with the existence of trivial rights,
such as my right to fill in my tax return with either blue or black
ink, or your promissory right that I check on your houseplants while
you are away. Most theorists would agree that <em>A</em>&rsquo;s
claim-right gives <em>B</em> what Raz (1975: 35&ndash;48) calls an
exclusionary reason: a second-order reason not to act on some
first-order reason. Exclusionary reasons have a distinctive force, but
they need not be very important. For example, your promissory right
that I check on your houseplants might exclude from my reasoning the
fact that I just cannot be bothered to do the checking, while
nonetheless permitting me to act on other overriding reasons. Related
ideas include McDowell&rsquo;s suggestion that some
reasons&mdash;perhaps those entailed by
rights&mdash;&ldquo;silence&rdquo; what would otherwise be
countervailing reasons (McDowell 1998: 90&ndash;93) or that rights are
what Kagan (1998: 72) calls deontological &ldquo;constraints&rdquo;
that should not be violated in order to minimize their own
violation.</p>

<p>
How and whether rights become imbued with their special normative
force is a matter of ongoing scholarly inquiry. As Sreenivasan (2010)
notes, a Hohfeldian claim-right in itself only entails the existence
of a duty with a certain structure, and not a duty with a certain
force. <em>A</em> has a claim against <em><em>B</em> if and only if
<em>B</em></em> has a duty to <em>A</em>: in this definition it is the
&ldquo;direction&rdquo; of <em>B</em>&rsquo;s duty (that it is owed to
<em>A</em>) which correlates <em>B</em>&rsquo;s duty to
<em>A</em>&rsquo;s right; nothing is said in the definition about the
duty&rsquo;s strength. When and why &ldquo;directed
duties&rdquo;&mdash;as above, those owed to an entity&mdash;have
greater normative priority than &ldquo;undirected duties&rdquo;
remains an open question. (See Thompson 2004 and Darwall 2012 on
&ldquo;bipolar&rdquo; judgments.) Whatever priority rights have, it
seems that sometimes this priority is limited to some domain: the
legal right of British actors to smoke onstage during a performance,
for instance, need not be upheld though the heavens fall.</p>

<p>
Dworkin&rsquo;s metaphor suggests that rights trump non-right
objectives, such as increasing national wealth. What of the priority
of one right with respect to another? We can keep to the trumps
metaphor while recognizing that some rights have a higher priority
than others. Within the trump suit, a jack still beats a seven or a
three. Your right of way at a flashing yellow light has priority over
the right of way of the driver facing a flashing red; and the right of
way of an ambulance with sirens on trumps you both.</p>

<p>
This metaphor of trumps leads naturally to the question of whether
there is any right that has priority to absolutely all other normative
considerations: whether there is an &ldquo;ace of rights&rdquo;.
Gewirth (1981) asserts that there is at least one such absolute right:
the right of all persons not to be made the victim of a homicidal
project. For such a right to be absolute, it would have to trump every
other consideration whatsoever: other rights, economic efficiency,
saving lives, everything. Not all would agree with Gewirth that even
this very powerful right overrides every conceivable normative
concern. Some would think it might be justifiable to infringe even
this right were this somehow necessary, for example, to prevent the
deaths of a great many people.</p>

<h3 id="ConRig">5.2 Conflicts of Rights?</h3>

<p>
Dworkin&rsquo;s trumping metaphor makes it tempting to characterize
the normative force of rights in the strong terms of
<em>conclusive</em> reasons. Were we to go this route, we would need
to temper the &ldquo;conclusiveness&rdquo; of the conclusive reasons
implied by rights assertions to accommodate the facts that some rights
have priority to others, that some rights are relatively trivial, and
that few if any rights outweigh all non-right considerations in all
circumstances.</p>

<p>
This line of thought can be developed by saying that the reasons
associated with rights are conclusive <em>within the area covered by
the right</em>, but are not conclusive outside of that area. The
theoretical position at the end of this line of thought is called
&ldquo;specificationism&rdquo; (Shafer-Landau 1995; Oberdiek 2008).
The specificationist holds that each right is defined by an elaborate
set of qualifications that specify when it does and when it does not
apply: a set of qualifications that define the right&rsquo;s
&ldquo;space&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The test of specificationism is how convincingly it can explain what
occurs when rights appear to conflict. Rights do often appear to
conflict (Sinnott-Armstrong 1996; Kamm 2007: 262&ndash;301). For
example, on a certain day it may seem that the public&rsquo;s right to
protest is conflicting with the government&rsquo;s right to keep order
on public property. When confronted with a case like this one, we will
judge that one or the other (say, the public&rsquo;s) right should
prevail. However, we do not believe that one of these rights is always
stronger than the other. Given different circumstances, our judgment
might favor the other (in this case, the government&rsquo;s) right.
When rights appear to conflict like this, the usefulness of the image
of rights as trumps begins to dim.</p>

<p>
A specificationist will attempt to dispel any appearance of conflict
of rights. For example, a specificationist will say that what is
colloquially referred to as &ldquo;the public&rsquo;s right to
protest&rdquo; is actually, on closer examination,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the public&rsquo;s right to protest, unless the protest would cause
serious risk to life or property, or would lead to the spread of a
deadly disease, or&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, the government&rsquo;s right should really be specified
more fully as the right:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
to control what happens on public property, but not to the extent of
stopping peaceful protest, unless the protest would lead to the spread
of deadly disease, but not&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the specificationist view, rights fit together like pieces in a
jigsaw puzzle, so that in each circumstance there is only one right
which determines what is permitted, forbidden or required. Rights
never conflict: they are always, to use Steiner&rsquo;s phrase,
&ldquo;compossible&rdquo; (Steiner 1994).</p>

<p>
Feinberg (1980: 221&ndash;51) and Thomson (1990: 82&ndash;104) object
to this specificationist view of rights. First, fully specified rights
would be unknowable: no one could set out all of the qualifications
that define even the simplest right. Second, rights so understood lose
their explanatory force: for the specificationist rights can only be
the conclusions, not the premises, of arguments concerning which side
in any dispute should prevail. Third, specificationists cannot explain
the &ldquo;moral residue&rdquo; of a &ldquo;defeated&rdquo; right. For
instance, consider a case in which your property right in the pie
cooling on your window sill conflicts with John&rsquo;s right to do
what he must do to keep from starving. John&rsquo;s right may prevail
in this case; still, after John rightfully eats your pie he should
apologize to you, and compensate you if he can. Thomson alleges that
specificationists cannot explain this, since on their view there is no
right of yours that John has violated.</p>

<p>
Thomson prefers the view that there really are conflicts of rights,
and suggests that we should speak of a &ldquo;defeated&rdquo; right as
being permissibly &ldquo;infringed&rdquo; (instead of
&ldquo;violated&rdquo;), leaving residual obligations on the
infringer. Frederick (2014) chases down some specificationist replies
to these objections, and concludes that although moral rights are
strong moral considerations, they are only <em lang="la">pro
tanto</em>. Liberto (2014) develops a more sophisticated
specificationist position, which is critiqued by Montague (2015).
Mullins (2020) offers a logical framework of practical reasoning that
claims to capture the dynamics of the debate over specification;
Zylberman (2022) sets out a &ldquo;holistic specificationism&rdquo;
while Rettig (forthcoming) defends a qualified generalism.</p>

<h3 id="SupAmoRig">5.3 Support among Rights</h3>

<p>
Philosophers have discussed not only how rights can conflict, but how
they sometimes support one another. For example, Henry Shue has argued
that both rights of security and rights of subsistence are
&ldquo;basic rights&rdquo; because they are indispensable for the full
enjoyment of all other rights&mdash;while other rights are non-basic
because they are not indispensable for the enjoyment of these two. If
the enjoyment or realization of a controversial right is an important
precondition for the enjoyment of an uncontroversial right, one can
defend the controversial right by documenting its strong supporting
role. Such a &ldquo;linkage argument&rdquo; is used by Shue to defend
the right to subsistence as a basic right, and by Sen to defend rights
to democracy and freedom of the press as supportive of the right to
adequate nutrition in developing countries (Shue 1980 [1996], Sen
1999). Shue&rsquo;s and Sen&rsquo;s assertions have been criticized as
exaggerated (Nickel 2008; Myhrvold-Hanssen 2003 [in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>]).</p>
 
<p>
Nickel (2008, 2010, 2016) develops a sophisticated typology of
supporting relations between rights (see also Gilabert 2010). One
right strongly supports another when it is logically or practically
inconsistent to endorse the implementation of the second right without
endorsing the simultaneous implementation of the first. For example,
the right to bodily security strongly supports the right to freedom of
assembly. One right weakly supports another when it is useful but not
essential to it. The right to education, for example, weakly supports
the right to a fair trial. Nickel argues that the strength of
supporting relations between rights varies with quality of
implementation. Poorly implemented rights provide little support to
other rights, while rights that are more effectively implemented tend
to provide greater support to other rights. The right to due process
supports the right to equal treatment for members of different racial
and ethnic groups&mdash;but the support will be soft if the right to
due process is only weakly implemented.</p>

<p>
Rights that weakly support each other are interdependent. Rights that
strongly support each other are indivisible. Beginning with the 1968
Proclamation of Tehran, the United Nations has promoted the idea
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible, the full
realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of
economic, social and cultural rights is impossible. (Proclamation of
Tehran #13; see Whelan 2010)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nickel holds that this indivisibility thesis exaggerates the density
and strength of supporting relations among human rights. He allows,
however, that many supporting relations exist between
rights&mdash;particularly under high-quality implementation&mdash;and
endorses the use of linkage arguments when indispensability can be
shown. (It is worth noting that much of what Nickel says about
supporting relations between rights can be applied <em lang="la">mutatis
mutandis</em> to supporting relations between
duties, and also to relations between non-rights values.)</p>

<h3 id="RigDoWro">5.4 Rights to Do Wrong</h3>

<p>
Are there rights to do wrong? Many have thought so. Waldron (1993: 63)
gives the example of antiwar protesters organizing a rowdy
demonstration near a Remembrance Day service; Carl Wellman (1997: 33)
offers the illustration of edging into a checkout line with a full
cart, just ahead of a tired parent carrying triplets. The puzzle is
how the positive normative force of &ldquo;a right&rdquo; can exist so
close to an opposed negative normative pole, &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. In
Hohfeldian terms, how can there be a right (no duty not) to do what it
is wrong (duty not) to do? (Similar questions arise about &ldquo;the
abuse of rights&rdquo; (Schauer 1981).)</p>

<p>
There are two main readings of rights to do wrong. The first reading
characterizes rights to wrong as rights against interference (Enoch
2002; &Oslash;verland 2007; Bolinger 2017). Rights entitle their
holders to make choices, and as Waldron (1993) says the importance of
a person&rsquo;s having choices would be diminished if she were forced
to do the right thing. Even though the person has no (privilege-)
right to perform an action that is wrong, it would nevertheless
violate an important (claim-) right of hers for others to compel her
not to do that thing. To take the speech example, we respect the
autonomy of speakers when we allow them to speak unmolested&mdash;even
when they do wrong by expressing themselves in disrespectful ways.
(For a defense of Waldron&rsquo;s reading against objections from
Galston 1983 and George 1993, see Herstein 2012; but see also the
further objections in Bolinger 2017, Laborde 2021. On the existence
and value of legal rights to do legal wrongs, see Herstein 2014.)</p>

<p>
The second reading of rights to do wrong sees them as involving a
mid-sentence shift in domains of reasons. There is no mystery, after
all, in having a <em>legal right</em> to do something <em>morally</em>
wrong. The potential for a legal right to do a moral wrong arises from
the fact that the domains of legal and moral reasons are not perfectly
overlapped. One has a legal privilege to edge in front of the tired
mother in the check-out line, but this is something that one has a
moral duty not to do. Similarly, one might have a moral privilege to
do what one has no customary privilege to do (a moral right to do a
customary wrong), and so on. Each domain of reasons is distinct, and
however conclusive are the reasons that any particular
rights-assertion implies, these are only reasons within a single
domain of reasons (moral, or legal, or customary).</p>

<p>
A related question concerns how it can come to be permissible to treat
A in certain ways that would, but for the actions or situation of A,
be wrong. For example, it is wrong purposefully to impose a hardship
on another person, unless that person has acted in a way that merits
punishment. Christopher Wellman (2017) makes a close study of how it
can be permissible to punish, concluding that the best explanation is
that the wrongdoer has <em>forfeited</em> her right against hard
treatment. A separate line of scholarship running through work by
Thomson (1990), McMahan (1994), Otsuka (1994), Lazar (2009) and Frowe
(2014), debates how it can be permissible to attack innocents
during war (see Walen 2019: 2&ndash;8).</p>

<h3 id="RigBelFeeWan">5.5 Rights to Believe, Feel, and Want</h3>

<p>
Moral rights, legal rights, and customary rights all define domains of
rights within the realm of <em>rights of conduct</em>: rights
concerning how agents may and should <em>act</em>. When our reasons
within these three different domains conflict, we may have reasons of
different kinds to act in different ways. Yet there are also rights
entirely beyond the realm of conduct. These are rights to
<em>believe</em>, to <em>feel</em> and to <em>want</em>. For example,
the prime minister asserts that he had a right to believe what his
advisors told him. The artist says she has a right to feel angry at
her critics. The frustrated suburbanite complains they have a right to
want more out of life.</p>

<p>
The realm of rights of rights to believe, to feel, and to want are the
realms of <em>epistemic</em>, of <em>affective</em>, and of
<em>conative</em> rights. Together with the realm of rights of
conduct, these are the four realms of rights. Each of these four
realms of rights defines a separate conceptual space: there are no
epistemic rights to act, and no affective rights to believe. What is
distinctive about the three realms of rights beyond the rights of
conduct is that they seem only to contain only privilege-rights (Wenar
2003). One may, for example, have a privilege-right to believe what
one&rsquo;s eyes tell one, and a privilege-right to feel proud of what
one has done. It is interesting to consider why these epistemic,
affective, and conative realms contain no claims, powers, or
immunities, and what the relation is between rights in these realms
and rights of conduct (Watson 2021).</p>

<p>
Philosophers have long been interested in epistemic rights in
particular (Altschul 2010
 [<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>];
 Graham &amp; Pedersen 2020), though there is also skepticism about
this category (Glick 2010). William James, for instance, calls <em>The
Will to Believe</em>,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
an essay in justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a
believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our
merely logical intellect may not have been coerced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
James&rsquo;s &ldquo;radical&rdquo; conclusion in the essay is that
&ldquo;we have the right to believe at our own risk any hypothesis
that is live enough to tempt our will&rdquo; (James 1896 [1956: 2,
29]).</p>

<p>
Similarly, the deepest questions in Kant&rsquo;s philosophy are framed
in terms of rights. In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (1781/87),
the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories aims to prove the
validity of the employment of the concepts of pure understanding. In
the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> (1788), the Deduction of
Freedom aims to demonstrate our entitlement to regard ourselves as
free. In both Deductions, the central question is a <em lang="la">quaestio
iuris</em>: &ldquo;By what right?&rdquo;
Kant&rsquo;s questions are: By what right do we employ the categories;
and by what right do we think of ourselves as free?</p>

<h3 id="WhoHolRig">5.6 Who Can Hold Rights?</h3>

<p>
Many kinds of being are regularly described as right-holders,
including living humans, animals, groups, business corporations,
states and social institutions. Other kinds of beings have a
controversial status as right-holders, with some theorists affirming
that they hold rights and others disagreeing: examples include dead
and future people, rivers, ecosystems, AI networks, planets, works of
art, fictional characters, and even abstract normative entities such
as Love or Reason. Contrastingly, some kinds of things seem never to
be considered right-holders: rocks, gases, flames, artefacts like cars
or hammers, and such abstract objects as the number three or the color
blue.</p>

<p>
What determines whether a particular type of being should be included
in the class that can hold rights? Theories such as the Will Theory or
the Interest Theory&mdash;theories of rights&rsquo; distinctive
function&mdash;carry implications for who can qualify as a
right-holder.
 <a href="#WilTheIntThe">Section 2.2.2</a>
 notes that classic Will Theorists have to conclude that babies,
animals, and any other beings unable to exercise powers of control
over duties cannot qualify as right-holders. In the same way,
Wenar&rsquo;s Kind-Desire Theory entails that entities incapable of
wanting something, given their kind, cannot hold rights: this excludes
rocks, cars and numbers from being right-holders. And the Interest
Theory implies that entities for which things can go neither better
nor worse&mdash;such as numbers or colors&mdash;cannot hold
rights.</p>

<p>
Alongside limits driven by accounts of rights&rsquo; distinctive
function, further limits on who can be right-holders are often
introduced on independent grounds. Such moves are especially prevalent
among Interest Theorists, for many entities that possess interests in
a broad sense&mdash;such as artefacts and works of
art&mdash;nonetheless seem incapable of holding rights, and this
requires explanation. Raz (1986: 166), for example, maintains that
only beings whose well-being is of &ldquo;ultimate value&rdquo; or
else who are &ldquo;artificial persons&rdquo; can be
right-holders.</p>

<p>
Kramer also holds that &ldquo;ultimate value is the hallmark of the
beings who are included in the category of potential holders of
claim-rights&rdquo; (2024: 317). Kramer argues that living humans,
dead and future people, certain groups and corporations, and many but
not all non-human animals are included in the class of potential legal
right-holders, and many of these are also holders of pre-legal moral
rights. At the same time, he argues that plants, ecological entities
such as rivers or rock formations, fictional entities and artworks are
excluded because they lack &ldquo;self-reflective attunedness that is
characteristic of conscious engagement with oneself and with the
world&rdquo;, despite the fact that the furtherance of the interests
of many such entities is intrinsically valuable (Kramer 2024:
318).</p>

<p>
There is much work on the possibility of dead people holding rights,
including Baier 1981, Belliotti 1979, Brecher 2002, Bowen 2022, Fabre
2008, Stemplowska 2020. There is also much work on the idea of future
people&rsquo;s rights, including Fabre 2009, Woods 2016, Kramer
2024&mdash;see also entries on
 <a href="../nonidentity-problem/">the non-identity problem</a>
 and broader work on
 <a href="../justice-intergenerational/">intergenerational justice</a>.
 There is an equally extensive literature on
 <a href="../moral-animal/">animal rights and rights of ecosystems</a>.
 Some legal systems have made ground-breaking claims to accord legal
rights to rivers and mountains; such claims are scrutinized in Kramer
2024 and J. Gilbert 2024.
 <a href="../rights-group/">Group rights and rights of corporations</a>
 are discussed in their own entry, and emerging topics include the
possibility of rights against the self (Mu&ntilde;oz &amp;

Garza 2015).</p>

<h2 id="ThrAppJusRig">6. Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights</h2>

<p>
There are two leading philosophical approaches to explaining which
fundamental rights of conduct there are, and why these rights should
be respected. These two approaches are broadly identifiable as
deontological and consequentialist. Status (deontological) theories
hold that human beings have attributes that make it fitting to ascribe
certain rights to them, and make respect for these rights appropriate.
Instrumental (consequentialist) theories hold that respect for
particular rights is a means for bringing about some valuable state of
affairs. Each approach has characteristic strengths and weaknesses;
the long-running contest between them is ongoing.</p>

<p>
Quinn (1993: 170) sketches a modern status theory this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A person is constituted by his body and his mind. They are parts or
aspects of him. For that very reason, it is fitting that he have
primary say over what may be done to them&mdash;not because such an
arrangement best promotes overall human welfare, but because any
arrangement that denied him that say would be a grave indignity. In
giving him this authority, morality recognizes his existence as an
individual with ends of his own&mdash;an independent <em>being</em>.
Since that is what he is, he deserves this recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Quinn contrasts his status approach to rights with one that ascribes
rights &ldquo;because such an arrangement best promotes overall human
welfare&rdquo;. His target is consequentialist theories of rights, the
paradigm of which are utilitarian theories. We met such a utilitarian
theory of rights above in John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s conceptualization
of rights as &ldquo;something which society ought to defend me in the
possession of&rdquo;. Mill believed that society ought to defend the
individual in possession of her rights because doing so would bring
about the greatest utility summed across the members of that
society.</p>

<p>
The two approaches differ sharply over the role of consequences in the
justification of ascribing rights. As Quinn (1993: 173) says about the
status approach:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not that we think it fitting to ascribe rights because we think
it is a good thing that rights be respected. Rather we think respect
for rights a good thing precisely because we think people actually
have them&mdash;and&hellip; that they have them because it is fitting
that they should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Within a status approach, rights are not means for the promotion of
good consequences. They are rather, in Nozick&rsquo;s phrase, <em>side
constraints</em> on the pursuit of good consequences (Nozick 1974:
29). A status approach frowns on any rights violation, even for the
sake of maximizing the non-violation of rights overall (as in a
&ldquo;utilitarianism of rights&rdquo;). Such an approach emphasizes
the &ldquo;agent-relative&rdquo; reasons that each person has to avoid
violating the rights of others. Sophisticated status theorists allow
that respect for rights necessarily serves certain aspects of human
welfare or certain interests, but these are status interests in the
fulfillment of rights: interests created by or logically subsequent to
the rights rather than independent interests that the rights serve
(see Ripstein&rsquo;s [2013: 180] &ldquo;rights theory of
interests&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
A status-based justification thus begins with the nature of the
right-holder and arrives immediately at the right. The instrumental
approach starts with the desired consequences and works backward to
see which rights-ascriptions will produce those consequences.</p>

<h3 id="StaBasRig">6.1 Status-Based Rights</h3>

<p>
Status theories belong to the tradition of natural rights theories.
All natural rights theories fix upon features that humans have by
their nature, which make respect for certain rights appropriate, and
agree that human reason can grasp that it is appropriate to treat
beings with such features in certain ways. Non-religious theories tend
to fix upon the same sorts of attributes described in more or less
metaphysical or moralized terms: free will, rationality, autonomy, or
the ability to regulate one&rsquo;s life in accordance with
one&rsquo;s chosen conception of the good life.</p>

<p>
Natural rights theory reached its high point in the early modern era,
in the work of Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, and especially Locke. Locke
argued that men have rights to &ldquo;life, liberty, and estate&rdquo;
in a pre-political state of nature, and that these natural rights put
limits on the legitimate authority of the state (Locke 1689, Section
87). Locke&rsquo;s influence can be seen in the revolutionary American
and French political documents of the eighteenth century, and
especially in Jefferson&rsquo;s Declaration of Independence
(1776):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The revival of status theory within contemporary philosophy began with
Nozick&rsquo;s <em>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</em> (1974). While
Nozick does acknowledge a debt to Locke&rsquo;s theory of property, he
centers his explanation of the moral force of individual rights on the
Kantian imperative not to treat humanity merely as a means to an end.
Each person&rsquo;s rights impose side-constraints on others&rsquo;
pursuit of their goals, Nozick says, because each person possesses an
inviolability that all others must respect. &ldquo;Individuals have
rights&rdquo;, he wrote, &ldquo;and there are things no person or
group may do to them (without violating their rights)&rdquo; (Nozick
1974: ix).</p>

<p>
Many find grounding rights directly in individual dignity appealing.
For example, Kamm (2007: 247) explains the right of free expression as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The right to speak may simply be the only appropriate way to treat
people with minds of their own and the capacity to use means to
express it&hellip; To say that any given person is not entitled to the
strong right to free speech is&hellip; a way of saying that certain
crucial features of human nature are not sufficient to generate the
right in anyone. And this seems to be a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, status-based rights are attractively robust. While the
justifications of instrumental rights are always contingent on
calculations concerning consequences, status-based rights tend to be
strong, almost unqualified rights, which some believe properly
expresses the great value of each person.</p>

<p>
However, one does not wish to be carried from the great importance of
each individual to the implausible position that all fundamental
rights are absolute. As Nagel (2002: 36) allows while defending a
status view, &ldquo;there are evils great enough so that one would be
justified in murdering or torturing an innocent person to prevent
them&rdquo;. This leaves the status theorist needing to explain how a
theory which rejects consequences so resolutely at the outset can
concede their importance later on.</p>

<p>
Moreover, the simplicity of the status approach to rights can also
appear to be a liability. On close examination, the fundamental rights
that most people believe in are intricately &ldquo;shaped&rdquo;. For
example, the right to free speech sometimes contains a right to say
what the speaker knows to be untrue. Yet we tend to be more tolerant
of deceitful speech in political campaigns than we are of deceitful
speech in advertising or in the courtroom. It is an open question
whether status theory has the conceptual resources to explain why
individual rights should be shaped in these specific ways.</p>

<p>
Status theory also faces the challenge of vindicating its foundations
and its scope. Why after all is it &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; to ascribe
individuals rights? The Kantian value of inviolability can look
puzzling when presented independently of a metaphysical grounding. As
Nagel (2002: 34) admits, &ldquo;it has proven extremely difficult to
account for such a basic, individualized value such that it becomes
morally intelligible&rdquo;. This is a quiet echo of Bentham&rsquo;s
protest that the doctrine of natural rights &ldquo;is from beginning
to end so much flat assertion: it lays down as a fundamental and
inviolable principle whatever is in dispute&rdquo; (Bentham 1796
[1987: 66]). Cruft (2010: 451) has attempted to deepen the theory of
the non-instrumental value of basic rights, by showing that such
rights are constitutive of &ldquo;relationships that bind all humans
together in fellowship as members of a
shared-proto-community&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Even so, status theorists must also resolve an internal debate over
which rights should be thought to express an individual&rsquo;s
inviolability. Nozick holds that status-based rights include rights to
whatever property one has acquired, while other status theorists
reject this &ldquo;right libertarianism&rdquo; in favor of &ldquo;left
libertarianism&rdquo; that matches strong rights to self-ownership
with initially equal shares of &ldquo;world-ownership&rdquo;
(Vallentyne &amp; Steiner 2000; Otsuka 2003). Status theories also
need to pay particular attention to the rights that society should
enforce in cases of widespread non-compliance with &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;
rights (Quong &amp; Stone 2015).</p>

<h3 id="InsRig">6.2 Instrumental Rights</h3>

<p>
Instrumental theories see rights as instruments for independently
valuable results. We can distinguish two broad types of instrumental
theory: First, distributive instrumental theories justify systems of
rights as useful or necessary means for achieving an optimal
distribution of advantages. The archetypal instrumental theory is some
form of two-level consequentialism, such as rule utilitarianism.
Within such a theory, rights are rules the general observance of which
will lead to an optimal distribution of advantages. In rule
utilitarianism, the optimal distribution is the one that contains the
greatest aggregate utility.</p>

<p>
A second instrumental approach is non-distributive. It justifies
particular individual rights as means that serve particular goods of
particular individuals, independently of the wider consequences of the
rights. Raz&rsquo;s interest theory of rights fits this pattern:
according to Raz, my right to education is justified by the fact that
my own interests in education are sufficient to place others under a
duty to educate me (Raz 1986: 166). This account justifies my right
instrumentally in terms of its use in securing education for me, but
independently of my right&rsquo;s wider effects on education or other
goods for others, and independently of implications for the
distribution of such rights to others.</p>

<p>
Important questions for instrumental theorists concern the demarcation
of the goods that a given right is justified as serving, and the
extent to which a right is justified instrumentally on its own or as
part of a system with others&rsquo; rights. For example, is my right
not to be tortured justified simply by how it serves me, or by how it
serves others beyond me? What about my right to an allotted parking
space? The latter seems most plausibly justifiable as part of a system
which serves many, while the former might appear justifiable
independently of its role in a system, and independently of whether it
serves others beyond me as right-holder (for discussion, see Cruft
2019: Ch. 8). Addressing these questions helps clarify the extent to
which an instrumental justification of rights is
&ldquo;distributive&rdquo; or not.</p>

<p>
Further important questions concern cases that seem broadly
teleological but not instrumental. Owens justifies my promissory
rights by appeal to the value that the power of promising has in
serving my &ldquo;normative interests&rdquo;: interests in control
over the normative landscape (Owens 2012). This is a teleological
defense of promissory rights, but the power-right to promise appears
not as an instrument serving our normative interests, but rather as
constituting the very thing&mdash;normative control&mdash;in which we
have a right-justifying interest, and the claim-rights created by
promising are again not instruments to serve our normative interests,
even though their justification on this account is teleological.</p>

<p>
Classic consequentialist justifications of rights face classic
objections, for example that the resulting rights will be too flimsy.
If rights are justified only insofar as they generate the best
consequences, it may seem that the theory will need to prune its
rights, perhaps severely, whenever maximum utility lies elsewhere. Why
is it not a rule in a two-level system, for example, that one should
frame an innocent man if this would prevent a major riot? Why should
it not be a rule that one should &ldquo;violate&rdquo; the right of an
innocent not to be killed if this would prevent the killings of two
innocents elsewhere? While status-based rights can appear to be too
strong, consequentialist rights can appear to be too weak. (See Pettit
1988 for a counter-argument.)</p>

<p>
Weak rights are a problem for utilitarianism because its focus on
maximization makes it indifferent to certain facts about how utility
is distributed across individuals. However, utilitarianism is not the
only kind of distributive instrumental theory. For example, a pure
egalitarian theory will portray rights as instruments for achieving a
more equal distribution of advantages. A prioritarian theory will
define an optimal distribution in a manner similar to egalitarianism,
except that it will give extra weight to the interests of those worse
off. Other distributive instrumental theories characterize
&ldquo;optimal distribution&rdquo; in other ways (Sumner 1987: 171).
Distributive theories that do not define an optimal distribution in
terms of maximization may face less pressure than utilitarianism does
from concerns about weak rights (Scanlon 1977). And non-distributive
instrumental theories are able to side-step these concerns about
strength by focusing solely on the justification of a given
individual&rsquo;s right, and leaving the question of its comparative
strength to depend on related but independent factors.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, all instrumental theories&mdash;even non-distributive
ones&mdash;will have to address longstanding questions about the
commensurability and interpersonal comparison of interests. Since
instrumental theorists work with overall evaluations of how well off
individuals would be were certain rights ascribed, they must explain
how distinct categories of interests (e.g., health, income,
opportunities for self-expression, social recognition) trade off
against one another, either across many people (as in distributive
approaches) or within a given individual life (as in non-distributive
approaches).</p>

<p>
Status theories are subject to the objection that they lack the
conceptual resources to explain why the rights we believe in are
intricately &ldquo;shaped&rdquo; to accommodate the particularities of
different contexts and different right-holders. Instrumental theories
are vulnerable to the mirror-image objection. An instrumental
theorist&mdash;distributive or non-distributive&mdash;can appeal to
any number of distinct interests, which are at stake for any number of
differently-situated individuals, to explain why a certain right
should be held only by certain persons or only in certain
circumstances. The danger for such a theorist is that the wealth of
normative resources at her command will permit the ascription of
whatever rights she favors. The theorist begins with the rights that
she wants to justify, then gives a &ldquo;just so&rdquo; story in
terms of an optimal distribution of interests that leads to exactly
those rights (Tushnet 1984; Frey 1984). Moreover all instrumental
justifications rely on empirical predictions concerning which
ascriptions of rights would produce which consequences, and there will
typically be enough slack in these empirical predictions for
instrumental theorists to fudge their derivations in order to reach
the desired rights.</p>

<p>
Both status theories and instrumental theories of rights have held a
perennial attraction. Because of this, many have been tempted to
search for a hybrid approach that would combine what is plausible in
each (e.g., Sen 1982).</p>

<h3 id="ConJusRig">6.3 Contractual and Justificatory Rights</h3>

<p>
A third approach to the justification of rights might be called
&ldquo;contractual&rdquo;. Here rights are characterized neither as
naturally fitting for independent beings nor as tools to promote the
best state of affairs. Rather, rights define principles that would be
chosen by properly situated and motivated agents agreeing to the basic
terms of their relations (e.g., principles chosen in Rawls&rsquo;s
original position, or principles within Scanlon&rsquo;s contractualism
that no one could reasonably reject). The fact that these principles
would be agreed to under the specified conditions is their
justification.</p>

<p>
The rights that define fundamental principles within these theories
are phrased in terms of what the theories&rsquo; agents have strong
reason to want. So, for example, Rawls states that the role of a
citizen&rsquo;s right of personal property</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is to allow a sufficient material basis for a sense of personal
independence and self-respect, both of which are essential for the
development and exercise of the two moral powers. (Rawls 1993:
298)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Scanlon says that reasonable individuals</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
have reason to insist &hellip; on basic rights, which give them
important forms of protection and control over their own lives.
(Scanlon 2003: 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Forst (2007 [2012]; 2014, 2016) combines critical and contractualist
theory into a sophisticated account of rights. Beginning with a
status-based fundamental right to justification, he shows how suitably
idealized demands for justification from individuals subordinated
within real relations of power can ground specific rights to relief
from and redress for actual injustices. Forst&rsquo;s framework shows
the enduring theoretical appeal and practical potential of the Kantian
tradition of understanding rights.</p>

<h2 id="CriRig">7. Critiques of Rights</h2>

<p>
Rights are subject to many criticisms. Some critics attack particular
rights, for example arguing that there are no genuinely natural rights
(Bentham 1796, Darby 2009) or no pre-institutional positive rights
(O&rsquo;Neill 1996), or no human rights (Geuss 2001), or few morally
justifiable property rights (Cruft 2019), or that in postcolonial
contexts human rights language is conceptually impoverished or
distorting (Flikschuh 2011; Hope 2016). Some criticize
liberalism&rsquo;s racialized and gendered oppression and exclusion
(Mills 2017; Schwartzman 2006), of which rights are one part.</p>

<p>
Sometimes the very idea of a right is criticized for its essential
features. A principal concern about the very idea is that rights
highlight a particular party&mdash;the right-holder&mdash;at the
expense of others, including duty-bearers and third parties. Yet
duty-bearers and third parties are often as profoundly affected by a
given right as the right-holder is, for example due to the burden of
having to fulfill duties entailed by the right, or due to &ldquo;third
party effects&rdquo; of the exercise of the right. These effects are
obscured, so the critic maintains, by thinking in terms of rights, and
the concept of rights thereby serves the ideological function of
making us care primarily about right-holders.</p>

<p>
Such a concern about how rights highlight the right-holder can be
found in a wide range of critical work, from feminists and Marxists to
utilitarians and to conservatives. One feminist version of this
concern highlights how the concept of a right focuses attention on
people who hold the status of &ldquo;heads of households&rdquo;, at
the expense of those lacking this status (Okin 1989). A conservative
version of the concern maintains that positive rights (e.g., to
education or health care) focus attention on needy claimants while
diverting attention away from the costs on those with duties to meet
such claims (Cranston 1973). A Marxist version of the same concern
highlights how property rights focus attention on wealthy property
holders while obscuring the costs imposed&mdash;by the need to respect
others&rsquo; property, and by third party effects of others&rsquo;
trades&mdash;on those with little wealth.</p>

<p>
The general concern arises from the way that the concept of rights
gives special status to a particular party as &ldquo;the
right-holder&rdquo; in relation to a duty. Two related critiques are
driven by this same feature: one is that &ldquo;rights thinking&rdquo;
generates selfishness and individualism, the other is that rights are
incompatible with proper recognition of the moral status of the
community or group. Both concerns are found in Marx, who attacked the
revolutionary eighteenth century American and French political
documents that proclaimed the fundamental &ldquo;rights of man&rdquo;:
liberty, equality, security, property, and the free exercise of
religion. Marx objected that these alleged rights derive from a false
conception of the human individual as unrelated to others, as having
interests that can be defined without reference to others, and as
always potentially in conflict with others. While many in leftist
traditions disagree and see space for rights to protect our social
needs and our interests in working together with others (Gould 1988),
for Marx the rights-bearing individual is an &ldquo;isolated
monad&hellip; withdrawn behind his private interests and whims and
separated from the community&rdquo; (Marx 1844 [1987: 146]).</p>

<p>
Somewhat similar criticisms are made by philosophers from African and
East Asian philosophical traditions. To say that a person has a right
not to be assaulted is partly to say that that person is the party who
is wronged if the person is assaulted (Thompson 2004). But some might
argue that it is better to say that the group or everyone is wronged
by the assault. On this sort of view, singling out the particular
individual for special status mistakenly overlooks their social
embeddedness, and overlooks how harming the individual involves
harming wider society. Along these lines, Ihara argues that in certain
contexts&mdash;games, dance, ritual activities&mdash;it is unnatural
to ascribe individual rights, and is more appealing to regard harms to
individuals as fundamentally harms to the group. By contrast, he notes
that the language of rights &ldquo;re-conceptualizes the activity in a
way that makes basic the individual, and not the team&rdquo; (Ihara
2004: 12).</p>

<p>
There is an ongoing debate about the extent to which the traditional
ideas of Confucianism have a place for this idea of rights, with its
special status for individual right-holders and the attendant idea
that the right-holder can call on this status to make claims in their
own name. Scholars like Ihara and Rosemont think that traditional
Confucian thought has no space for this individual-focused idea, even
though it contains important conceptions of human equality and worth
(Ihara 2004: 24; see also Rosemont 2004). Other theorists of
Confucianism and rights disagree; for instance, Chan argues that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Confucians will regard human rights as a fallback apparatus to protect
fundamental individual interests&mdash;they are important when
virtuous relationships break down and mediation fails to reconcile
conflicts. (Chan 2011: 99)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a related though distinct critical line of argument, some African
communitarian authors question the individualism of the concept of
rights. Menkiti writes that &ldquo;as far as Africans are concerned,
the reality of the communal world takes precedence over the relative
individual life histories, whatever these may be&rdquo; (Menkiti 1984:
171, building on Mbiti 1969). If read in what Gyekye calls a
&ldquo;radical communitarian&rdquo; way, these authors imply that it
is impossible to make proper sense of an individual&rsquo;s good,
needs or interests in the way required by rights theory: a way that
distinguishes or prioritizes the individual&rsquo;s good over the
communal world.</p>

<p>
For example, Raz&rsquo;s Interest Theory maintains that <em>X</em> has
a right if and only if <em>X</em>&rsquo;s interest is sufficient to
place others under a duty (see
 <a href="#WilTheIntThe">Section 2.2.2</a>
 above). Suppose it makes no sense to refer to
&ldquo;<em>X</em>&rsquo;s interest &rdquo; because what is good for
<em>X</em> cannot be isolated from or distinguished from what is good
for others or the wider group: <em>X</em> has no interests, only the
group does. Or suppose that although <em>X</em> does have individual
interests, these are never of importance sufficient to ground duties;
rather, only the good of people taken collectively has this kind of
normative importance. If either of these scenarios really is the case
(that is, either <em>X</em> has no individual interests, or <em>X</em>
has them but they lack right-grounding importance), then it seems that
<em>X</em> cannot hold rights under Raz&rsquo;s account, though
perhaps <em>X</em>&rsquo;s group can. Some North American or Western
European communitarian theories may have similar implications, such as
Taylor 1979 or Sandel 1982.</p>

<p>
Many African communitarians offer positions less opposed to rights:
positions that recommend a tempering of the individualism of current
rights and human rights practice, alongside a claim that communitarian
values can be compatible with individual rights so long as they are
framed appropriately (Gyekye 1997, Ajei 2015, Wingo 2010; see also
Chan 2011). Nonetheless, the extent to which rights are compatible
with non-individualistic normative and cultural frameworks remains a
matter of live debate (Buchanan 2013: ch. 7; Ishay 2004 [2008]).</p>
