Someone unfamiliar with the Middle Ages in the Western Christian,
Jewish, and Islamic worlds might evince doubts about whether political
philosophy existed at all during that period. Weren&rsquo;t these
forms of religious thought and practice monolithic, theocratic, even
authoritarian, leaving no room for philosophical reflection about
political matters? The answer is: Once one jettisons superficial
assumptions, one finds that, between roughly 900 and 1400 AD, vital,
diverse, and sophisticated theorizing about politics was produced by
Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. Moreover, the impact of medieval
political philosophy continued to be felt in Western and Eastern
cultures long after the close of the Middle Ages. Many key ideas about
law, power, and the relationship between religion and politics that
were debated during the medieval era resonated for centuries
thereafter&mdash;and even today. Nor were these three traditions
sealed off from one another. Rather, considerable cross-fertilization
occurred. In particular, philosophers in the Islamic world enjoyed
access to the writings of ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and
Aristotle during a time when they were virtually unknown in the
Christian West. Eventually, these classical texts, along with
commentaries on them, were transmitted to Europe by means of their
translation from Arabic, Hebrew or Greek languages into Latin. In sum,
the political philosophies pioneered during the Middle Ages can lay
valid claim to a place at the table alongside those of Greco-Roman
antiquity and of post-medieval vintage.</p>

<h2 id="ScopMediPoliPhil">1. The Scope of Medieval Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
In the popular imagination, the Middle Ages is often equated with the
&ldquo;Dark Ages&rdquo;, a period during which culture and reason gave
way to social disintegration and the excesses of mystical faith. In
part, this unfavorable estimation arises from a failure to realize
that historical periodization involves judgments of value which are
themselves political or ideological. The very term &ldquo;Middle
Ages&rdquo; stamps an entire civilization as a kind of interregnum
between what was &ldquo;really&rdquo; important, namely, classical
times&mdash;usually meaning Plato, Aristotle, and perhaps Cicero and
Seneca&mdash;and modernity. Yet reality is much more muddled than such
tidy categories would imply. In fact, any era of history is
inextricably linked to its past, however despised or revered. After
the collapse of the Western half of the Roman Empire, people living in
the Eastern part of the Empire continued to read and comment on many
Greek classics. Moreover, after the spread of Islam in the eighth
century throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean world,
Islamic and Jewish scholars possessed access to the great texts of
ancient Greek philosophy, as the result of a comprehensive attempt in
the Middle Ages in the Islamic world to transmit Greek culture via a
massive project of translating such works from Greek into Syriac and
then into Arabic or directly from Greek into Arabic (Gutas 2000). Even
in Western Europe, during a time in which most ancient Greek
philosophy had been lost, the great twelfth-century English scholar
and churchman John of Salisbury reminds us that we, like the students
of any age, can see farther only because we are standing on the
shoulders of the giants who came before us (John of Salisbury
<em>Metalogicon</em>: 257).</p>

<p>
People born during the period we term &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; continued
to reflect on and write about political questions and problems; their
texts abound in archives and libraries. Moreover, the philosophical
observations generated during the Middle Ages form an important
contribution to political thought. Medieval philosophers repeatedly
addressed many of the issues which define &ldquo;perennial&rdquo;
elements of political reflection. The intellectual in the Middle Ages,
no less than in other eras, wanted to discover the qualities of the
good polity and the proper roles and functions of the individual
within society. He (or occasionally she) was concerned with the
dilemmas posed by violence, corruption, and the abuse of authority,
for example. Medieval scholars sought to expound and defend doctrines
and ideas unknown to previous generations and to make sense of them in
the light of the past. The hegemony of revealed religion, the
persistence of pagan classical texts and ideas, and the development of
new social and political structures&mdash;all of these factors shaped
the distinctive philosophical outlooks on politics typical of writers
during the Middle Ages. In turn, numerous attributes of medieval
political practice and thought exercised a decisive influence on more
recent history. Principles of law, government, liberty, and rights so
cherished by modern citizens may be traced to medieval sources
(Tierney 1982; Oakley 2010, 2012, 2015).</p>

<p>
Before one can undertake a survey of medieval political philosophy,
however, it is necessary to confront squarely the historiographical
question of what counts as &ldquo;medieval&rdquo;. In the Islamic
context, the Middle Ages coincides with what is often described as the
&ldquo;Golden Age of Islam&rdquo;, a period between the eighth and
fourteenth centuries in which Islam enjoyed unrivaled cultural,
political, and economic hegemony in the Middle East, the
Mediterranean, and North Africa. Islam reached as far as
Spain&mdash;al-Andalus&mdash;and
Sicily&mdash;&#7778;iqilliyya&mdash;(the latter between the ninth and
the eleventh centuries). During this period, the Islamic world saw the
development of different forms of political power, which ranged from
several Islamic caliphates (among others, the Umayyad, the Abbasid,
the Fatimid mainly in the Middle East and North Africa, the Almoravids
and Almohads in al-Andalus, the Kalbids in Sicily), many of which
patronized the development of culture and the arts, to occasional
city-states such as the <em>taifa</em> in Spain. In this context,
philosophy was also used as an instrument to reflect on the structure
of the <em>ummah</em> (the community of the believers) and the role
and function of religion as law, but also the prerogatives of the
ruler, who was often modeled along the lines of a Platonic
philosopher-king (filtered through neo-Platonic ideas) and a prophet
or imam (Abb&eacute;s 2022; Butterworth 2004; Gutas 2004). A similar
pattern could be observed among Jewish thinkers who lived in the
Islamic and Christian worlds. For them, philosophy&rsquo;s conceptual
instruments were used to shed further light on social and political
issues stemming from rules prescribed by Jewish divine law and
jurisprudence. Scholars have debated about whether it is possible to
talk about the existence of political philosophy in medieval Islamic
and Jewish thought, given the strong interlinkage of metaphysics,
theology, and philosophy that characterized political reflection in
this period (Abb&eacute;s 2022; Gutas 2004; Syros 2011b). However,
several studies (Abb&eacute;s 2022; O&rsquo;Meara 2003) have shown
that the tradition of late Platonism and Neo-Platonism in antiquity
also contained a coherent political philosophy. This neo-Platonic
framework played a crucial role in influencing how Islamic and Jewish
medieval philosophers theorized about such genuinely political ideas
as law, religion, human sociability, and government.</p>

<p>
Scholars incline toward locating the origins of the Western Middle
Ages properly speaking in a deep historical break&mdash;what the
historian Robert I. Moore (2000) termed &ldquo;the first European
revolution&rdquo;&mdash;occurring around the year 1000, marked by a
series of fairly rapid social, political, economic, religious, and
cultural changes. This period saw the formation of most of the main
regional and institutional units that would persist well into the
modern world and of the languages (post-classical Latin and the
vernaculars) and cultural artifacts that came to define Western
civilization. Of particular relevance to political philosophy was the
emergence of codified legal systems&mdash;based on, but not slavishly
beholden to, Roman law&mdash;as well as the circulation and study of
classical non-Christian texts, first from Roman antiquity, and then
gradually from ancient Greece, especially Aristotle, newly translated
into Latin over the course of the thirteenth century (Baldwin 1971;
Colish 1997). Not only were these sources investigated in their own
right, but they were applied to and became fodder for the emergent
political conflicts of the first half of the second millennium. Such
controversies arose from a number of different disputes about the
ordering of political authority: between the church (whether the pope,
bishops, or the community of priests and believers generally) and
temporal authorities (such as territorial princes, urban
municipalities, and imperial power), between the Roman pontiff and the
Holy Roman Emperor (both pretenders to a sort of universal
jurisdiction), and between and within divergent regional units of
secular power (from the universal emperor, to kings and lesser
princes, to incorporated cities).</p>

<p>
Two main features characterized political philosophy in the medieval
period. First, it was the complex outcome of a dynamic interaction
between theoretical and theological problems, encompassing also very
practical concerns as well as ideological interests. Theorists
continuously undertook practices of reading, interpreting, explaining,
and writing in light of describing or understanding specific political
settings that varied depending on context. For example, some Byzantine
thinkers drew on Aristotle&rsquo;s ideas to discuss the prerogatives
of imperial power and its relationship to the mixed regime (Metochites
<em>Essays</em>; see Kaldellis 2011). In Western Europe, after
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> was translated from Greek into
Latin around 1260 by William of Moerbeke (Fl&uuml;eler 1992;
Lambertini 1999), many Latin Christian thinkers used its ideas (in
combination with Roman sources such as Cicero [Nederman 2020]) to
analyze the political regimes that they knew best or to defend and/or
attack specific typologies of government. Several writers used
Aristotle to defend the mixed regime (Blythe 1992). Ptolemy of Lucca
explained the Italian <em>comunes</em> of his own time by drawing on
the idea of the Roman <em lang="la">respublica</em> alongside the
Aristotelian notion of <em lang="el">demokrat&igrave;a</em>, while
Marsilius of Padua drew on Aristotelian language to attack the papal
theory of <em lang="la">plenitudo potestatis</em>. Likewise, in
medieval Jewish political thought, one finds considerable attention
devoted to how the Platonic and Aristotelian ideas of the mixed regime
reflect the monarchy that governed the Jews under Saul (Melamed 2003;
Nelson 2010). Muslim thinkers discussed in depth how Aristotle&rsquo;s
political naturalism might help to conceptualize the <em>ummah</em>
(Syros 2020). Quite often, in political treatises authored by
Christian, Muslim, and Jewish authors, we find sentences such as
&ldquo;as it can be found in&rdquo;, &ldquo;as it happens
today&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as can be seen in these days&rdquo;, marking
the topical nature of the ideas under discussion.</p>

<p>
Second, political philosophy in the Middle Ages hardly separated
considerations of power, government and society from ethical analysis.
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, a text that enjoyed
wide readership during the Middle Ages across the Christian (West and
East), Islamic, and Jewish worlds, contains important teachings
relevant to political philosophy. The <em>Ethics</em> was translated
into Arabic and thereafter commented on by numerous figures, including
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (the existence of whose commentary is widely
reported, although today it is lost; see Neria 2013), Ibn Rushd, Ibn
Bajja (who did not write a proper commentary but used this text in his
works), and the <em>Nasirean Ethics</em>. The latter, written in
Persian and then translated into Arabic (Na&#7779;&#299;r al-D&#299;n
1964) in the fourteenth century by al-&#486;ur&#487;&#257;n&#299;,
exercised considerable influence on subsequent Muslim political
thought. The <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> was also known in the
twelfth-century Byzantine world where, in the circle of Princess Anna
Comnene, some authors&mdash;for example, Eustratius of Nicaea and
Michael of Ephesus&mdash;wrote commentaries on it in Greek that were
translated into Latin, along with the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, by
Robert Grosseteste in the thirteenth century. The number of
commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s text in the Christian Latin world is
considerable (among others, it was commented on by Thomas Aquinas,
Albert the Great, John Buridan, and Radulphus Brito as well as by
several anonymous university professors or <em lang="la">magistri</em>).
Consequently, political philosophy came to
be defined as a science that deals with rules and actions of an
ethical nature (on this debate see Gutas 2004; Abb&egrave;s 2022;
Melamed 2005; Syros 2011b). Islamic and Jewish philosophers often
model political philosophy on the example of medicine and divide the
former into theoretical and practical parts. These two elements
roughly correspond to what we would today define as ethics and
politics.</p>

<p>
In the medieval Christian Latin world, an important debate about the
status of practical philosophy may be found in many commentaries on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and <em>Politics</em>.
For example, medieval commentators discussed <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> VI.8, according to which prudence and politics are the
same dispositions but their essence is different (see Lambertini
2008), and some took Aristotle&rsquo;s word <em>politics</em> in this
passage to refer to practical science (including ethics and political
philosophy). Commentators further discussed: (1) the relationship
between ethics or moral science (<em lang="la">scientia moralis</em>)
and politics or political science (<em lang="la">scientia
civilis</em>); (2) the epistemic status of practical sciences
vis-&agrave;-vis other theoretical sciences such as natural philosophy
and metaphysics; and (3) the connection between practical philosophy
and prudence as an intellectual virtue. (For an overview of these
debates, see Costa 2010; Lambertini 2008 and 2021; Toste 2022.) As
there are disagreements about how to reply to these questions, some
authors (for example, Peter of Auvergne and John Buridan) clearly
differentiate practical science (that is, politics as a form of
scientific knowledge) from moral and political action as the domain of
prudence, whereas others even ascribe to moral and political science
the same apodictic status as metaphysics (see Marsilius of Padua). In
fact, this would hardly be surprising, because in the Middle Ages
political themes were very often intertwined with debates in theology,
metaphysics, natural philosophy, and epistemology.</p>

<p>
In sum, political philosophy during the Middle Ages, so far from being
monotonous or monolithic, offers a diverse array of intellectual
traditions and paths to the study of politics. The questions examined
by its practitioners touch on nearly every topic that one would expect
to find in philosophical investigations undertaken in ancient and
modern times. Thus, wholesale rejection of the field as &ldquo;merely
medieval&rdquo;, and consequently mired in arcane debates of little
interest to political philosophers generally, represents a gross
distortion of the actual historical record.</p>

<p>
The following entry focuses on fifteen of the most consequential
political philosophers in the medieval traditions of political thought
between the tenth and the fifteenth centuries. The sections are
arranged in roughly chronological order (in many instances the birth
and/or death years of a particular figure are unknown). Within the
Islamic world, attention is devoted to Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, Ibn
Rushd, and Ibn Khald&#363;n. The primary Jewish philosopher surveyed
is Moses Maimonides. The largest share of the entry concerns political
philosophy in the Christian West (but there is also occasional
attention to Byzantine thinkers such as Michael of Ephesus), both
prior to the dissemination of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> and
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> (John of Salisbury) and after those texts
became available. This is because philosophical works that are
specifically or exclusively devoted to political themes are more
frequent in the Christian Western than in the Islamic and Jewish
worlds. In the latter, far more often than in the Christian West,
discussions of political ideas are contained within metaphysical,
theological or epistemological treatises. Most of the Christian
Western authors discussed were affiliated with the great universities
of Western Europe, either as students or teachers or both. These
include Thomas Aquinas (Paris and Cologne), Ptolemy of Lucca (Paris),
James of Viterbo (Paris), John of Paris (Paris), Marsilius of Padua
(Paris), William of Ockham (Oxford), and Nicole Oresme (Paris) as well
as the numerous commentators on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em>.
Many of them also became enmeshed in the political conflicts of the
age, especially between the papacy and various secular rulers. Thus,
the writings of James, John, Marsilius, and Ockham in particular
demand to be read against the backdrop of medieval politics. The
sources of the education received by Dante Alighieri and Christine de
Pizan are less certain, but both were steeped in the same classical
and Christian texts as their university-trained colleagues.</p>

One quality shared by the thinkers covered here is a deep concern
about the relationship between public affairs and religion.
Specifically, is temporal government a creation of God or of human
beings (or perhaps some combination thereof)? This question
immediately raises a set of ancillary issues about whether earthly
rulers and communities should be assigned some function in the
promotion of piety and worship, as well as whether they are required
to submit to religious authority. The solutions offered to these
dilemmas varied widely, however. Several of these philosophers
regarded religion to be wholly or mainly irrelevant to human politics.
Others viewed secular political power as a tool to be put in the
service of the faith. Indeed, a few theorists went so far as to place
religious persons and institutions under the direct control of
temporal government. Whatever the answer given, the earthly dimensions
of their respective religions were never far from the minds of
medieval political philosophers.</p>

<h2 id="AlFrb">2. Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;</h2>

<p>
In a certain sense, one could argue that the very origins of political
philosophy in the medieval world must be placed within the Islamic
context. Before the eleventh century in the West, little discussion
occurred about the topics we associate with political philosophy. The
first milieu in which we find examples of thorough theoretical and
philosophical debates with political implications is the Islamic
context of the ninth and tenth centuries under the Abbasid caliphate
and, more specifically, in the works of Islamic philosopher
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; (c. 870&ndash;950 CE). Little is known about
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s life, and its details are mostly
obscure due to the lack of reliable historical sources (Orwin 2017:
5). Scholars have suggested that he was probably a Shia scholar of
Turkmen or Persian origin and lived in Aleppo and Baghdad. He composed
several philosophical-political works, among them <em>The Enumeration
of the Sciences</em>, <em>The Book of Religion</em>, <em>The
Attainment of Happiness</em>, a <em>Summary of Plato&rsquo;s
Laws</em>, <em>The Political Regime</em>, and <em>Aphorisms of the
Statesman</em>. Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; is also said to have composed
a commentary on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics,</em> which is now lost. As
is the case for most Islamic political philosophy,
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s works show a clear dependence on
Plato, often filtered through neo-Platonic sources. However, scholars
debate over whether al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; actually had direct
access to Plato&rsquo;s texts or just to paraphrases or fragments of
them (Gutas 2004).</p>

<p>
The complex relationship between philosophy and divine science or
religion is the foundation of al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s
political thought. He claims that philosophy, the knowledge of
&ldquo;the principles of the existents&rdquo; which can help
&ldquo;the wise&rdquo; achieve the attainment of happiness, is
superior to religion because the latter &ldquo;is a sketch of these
things or of their images in the soul&rdquo; (<em>PR</em>: 75). At the
same time, religion is also the combination of opinions and rules
&ldquo;prescribed for a community by their first ruler&rdquo;, where
such an association can be &ldquo;a tribe, a city or district, a great
nation, or many nations&rdquo; (<em>Book of Religion</em>: 93).
Therefore, F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; s treatment of the relationship
between philosophy and religion is also political. In fact, he claims
that philosophers are kings and prophets and, to fuse Islamic beliefs
with Greek philosophy, presents the ruler as a Platonic
philosopher-king or an individual who has achieved moral and
intellectual perfection. If the philosopher is also a prophet as well
as the head of the <em>ummah</em>, this means that his political
activity, i.e., his government of the masses of people who are not
wise, must be studied in depth. Therefore, for
al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, philosophy in general, and political
philosophy more particularly, is seen as a way to explain and clarify
the content of Islamic revelation and its ethical and political
implications for society as a whole. This is also the reason why
F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; claims that political philosophy and political
science have a central role in his ideas about the organization of
human knowledge and the sciences. In fact, in his <em>The Enumeration
of Sciences</em> (<em>ES</em>: 76&ndash;77), he ascribes a central
role to political science in his classification of the sciences. He
claims that political science (<em>al-&lsquo;ilm al-madan&#299;</em>)
also includes the dialectical study of theology (<em>kal&#257;m</em>)
and Islamic jurisprudence (<em>fiqh</em>) and that it is the first and
most important science, even more so than metaphysics.</p>

<p>
In addition, al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; distinguishes theoretical and
practical components of political science, anticipating Ibn Rushd and
many other Jewish and Christian thinkers. Drawing a parallel with
medicine, F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; explains that political science has a
theoretical component that seeks the general and universal principles
of moral and political behavior and a more practical and operative
component which examines how these principles can help achieve the
goals of human perfection. Therefore, the role of political science is
also that of explaining how the imam-philosopher-king and prophet can
achieve a conjunction with the active intellect and can also serve to
guide the masses and the non-wise to virtue through religion. As
F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; writes, intellectual happiness is something that
&ldquo;is [cognized] by means of the theoretical-rational
faculty&mdash;not by any other of the rest of the faculties&rdquo;
(<em>PR</em>: 63&ndash;64), which is when a human being &ldquo;uses
the principles and the first cognitions that the active intellect gave
him&rdquo; (<em>PR</em>: 64). At the same time, most human beings are
unable to access these truths or to achieve conjunction with the
intellect. They can then only access philosophical truth imperfectly
and through forms of symbolic representation, which are not as perfect
as philosophy but allow them to attain intellectual perfection
according to their specific intellectual capabilities. The human
beings &ldquo;in whose souls&rdquo; philosophical truths &ldquo;are
found as they are imagined and who accept them and pursue them as
though they are like that are the faithful&rdquo; (<em>PR</em>: 75).
This distinction also has political implications because philosophical
discourse is targeted at the few philosophers in a society, whereas
religious discourse is aimed at non-philosophers or the masses who,
for F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, still participate in the intellectual and
ethical happiness pursued and achieved by philosophers.</p>

<p>
Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; provides a conceptualization of the Islamic
concept of <em>ummah</em> as a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual idea of
the commonwealth which is at odds with the pure <em>ummah</em> that
existed in the time of the prophet (Orwin 2017: 202). According to
Orwin, F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; promotes an idea of the commonwealth that
includes several ethnic <em>ummahs</em> that do not necessarily
require a uniform religious <em>ummah</em>, implicitly opening the
possibility for allowing a certain degree of religious variation
within an Islamic empire. In fact, in the <em>Political Regime</em>,
Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; explains that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is possible to imitate these things for each group and each nation,
using matters that are different in each case. Consequently, there may
be a number of virtuous nations and virtuous cities whose religions
are different, even though they all pursue the very same kind of
happiness. (<em>PR</em>: 41)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s original theory of the concept of
democracy is also worth highlighting (Khalidi 2003; Orwin 2015). Even
if F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; considers democracy to be a non-virtuous
regime, he nonetheless claims that it is the best among all the
non-virtuous regimes. Therefore, the democratic city is that from
which a virtuous city is most likely to emerge compared to others. He
provides a description of the democratic city as a multi-ethnic and
multi-lingual city (a description that might echo the Baghdad of his
own times). However, the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; of the city (which is
more a form of &ldquo;license&rdquo;) leads him to believe that power
there, despite being potentially anarchic (with no distinction between
rulers and ruled), can easily be turned into a despotic monarchy. The
democratic city is then corrupt because happiness is aimed at earthly
pleasures and not at the true intellectual fulfillment which is the
purpose of the virtuous city.</p>

<p>
The only work of al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; with political relevance
translated into Latin was his <em>Enumeration of Sciences</em>,
rendered by Gerard of Cremona (1114&ndash;1187) as <em lang="la">Liber
de scientiis</em>. This text had some influence in the Christian world
and, as far as the political domain is concerned, there are isolated
examples of one of his very particular ideas&mdash;that political
science (<em lang="la">scientia civilis</em>), which encompasses
ethics, was superior to metaphysics in the hierarchy of the sciences.
For example, this Farabian theory likely influenced Roger
Bacon&rsquo;s conceptualization of moral philosophy and Dante
Alighieri&rsquo;s defense of the primacy of moral philosophy in the
<em>Convivio</em>. Traces of this theory might also be found in
Marsilius of Padua who ascribes to practical sciences such as ethics
and political science the same apodictic status as metaphysics
(Quillet 1979; Mulieri 2019). (For further discussion, see the entries

 <a href="../al-farabi/">al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;</a>

<h2 id="JohnSali">3. John of Salisbury</h2>

<p>
The twelfth century is commonly considered to be a period of
intellectual renaissance in the Latin West in such fields as
philosophy, literature, and law. One of the beneficiaries of this
revival was political philosophy. The 1100s witnessed the emergence of
sustained and systematic reflection about the nature and purpose of
political society and about the normative standards by which political
institutions ought to be judged. No one contributed more to this
renaissance of political theory than John of Salisbury (c.
1115/20&ndash;1180 CE). Despite active engagement in ecclesiastical
affairs, he found time to compose works on education, history, and
hagiography, as well as his singular contribution to political
philosophy, the <em>Policraticus</em> (completed in 1159). (For an
extensive survey his life and career, see the entry on
 <a href="../john-salisbury/">John of Salisbury</a>,
 as well as Bollermann &amp; Nederman 2015; Nederman &amp; Bollermann
2020).</p>

<p>
A massive treatise running to some 250,000 words, the
<em>Policraticus</em> elucidated the moral and political standards by
which governments are to be evaluated, placing emphasis on the
edification of rulers and their servants. Subtitled <em>Of the
Frivolities of Courtiers and the Footprints of Philosophers</em>, the
<em>Policraticus</em> (the word is a neologism of John&rsquo;s
invention) is often described as the first complete work of medieval
Latin political philosophy (Nederman 2015). John begins with a long
satirical critique of the temptations associated with public life,
surveying the many forms of courtly entertainment which distract
officials from the performance of their duties. He stresses the
importance of the moral instruction of the ruler and the necessity for
the king to surround himself with literate and wise counselors; an
evil prince with equally vicious advisors will necessarily be a tyrant
who enslaves and oppresses his people (John of Salisbury
<em>Policraticus</em>: 13&ndash;25). John asserts that a
well-organized political community will resemble a healthy human body,
guided by the soul (priesthood), ruled by a wise head (the king), and
populated by all the limbs and organs (from the counseling heart to
peasant feet) necessary for the efficient, just, and mutually
beneficial functioning of the entire organism (<em>Policraticus</em>:
65&ndash;68). When this is achieved, the <em>Policraticus</em> states,
the order implicit in nature is realized, the divine will is obeyed,
and the earthly as well as eternal happiness of all members is
assured.</p>

<p>
Like most works of medieval philosophy, the <em>Policraticus</em>
depends heavily upon authoritative sources as a means for extending
and enhancing its arguments. Thinkers such as John believed that the
case for a specific claim was strengthened not only by rational
demonstration but also by the antiquity and the eminence of the
authorities one could adduce in support of it. Thus, we encounter
throughout the <em>Policraticus</em> extensive quotations from and
citations of both pagan and Christian sources, including Scripture and
the church Fathers as well as the texts and doctrines of pagan
antiquity, particularly thorough in the areas of rhetoric, philosophy,
and poetry. He styled himself a devotee of Cicero&rsquo;s
philosophical commitment to the moderate skepticism associated with
the New Academy and knew the available texts of the Ciceronian
corpus&mdash;although not directly Cicero&rsquo;s two major works of
political philosophy, <em>De re publica</em> and <em>De legibus,</em>
whose ideas were transmitted through Christian intermediaries like
Lactantius and St. Augustine (Grellard 2013; Nederman 2020:
62&ndash;84). Likewise, John integrated into the <em>Policraticus</em>
many citations from the major and minor Latin poets; among his
favorites were Virgil, Horace, Juvenal, Lucan, and Ovid (O&rsquo;Daly
2018).</p>

<p>
Of the philosophical and literary works of the ancient Greeks, John
knew little in comparison with later centuries; like virtually all
Western people of his time, he read no Attic Greek. He enjoyed access
to some of Plato&rsquo;s philosophy by means of an available partial
Latin translation of and commentary on the <em>Timaeus.</em> John was
also closely attuned to the reintroduction of Aristotle&rsquo;s
writings into the Latin West, demonstrating familiarity with the
entirety of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Organon</em>, that is, the six
treatises on logic (Bloch 2012). He gleaned from the <em>Organon</em>
some important elements of Aristotelian moral philosophy (such as the
doctrine of the golden mean and the psychology of moral character)
which he incorporated into the <em>Policraticus</em> (Nederman &amp;
Br&uuml;ckmann 1983).</p>

<p>
The paucity of classical models of politics posed something of a
dilemma for John, since his intellectual instincts resisted the
postulation of innovative concepts unsupported by long-standing
tradition. His solution is one that was not uncommon during the Middle
Ages: he created a bogus authority&mdash;in essence, he perpetrated a
forgery&mdash;in order to legitimize ideas that were otherwise
original to him (Martin 1984). (This is a technique that had already
been employed, for instance, in widely cited texts such the Donation
of Constantine and the Pseudo-Isidorian <em>Decretals</em>.)
Specifically, John fabricated a work called the &ldquo;Instruction of
Trajan&rdquo;, purportedly composed by the Roman imperial writer
Plutarch. He attributes to this treatise many of the most significant
and insightful features of his political theory, especially the claim
that the political system can be analyzed in detail as an organism or
living body whose parts are mutually devoted to and dependent upon one
another. The framework for the entirety of Books V and VI of the
<em>Policraticus</em> is allegedly borrowed from the
&ldquo;Instruction of Trajan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Because it was composed over the course of several years and touches
on a bewildering array of topics and issues, the <em>Policraticus</em>
might appear to be more of a rambling and disjointed collection of
stories and observations than a focused and coherent piece of
philosophical argumentation. But while this claim seems plausible on
initial inspection, the careful reader will discern in the
<em>Policraticus</em> a number of unifying elements which lend it
intellectual coherence. Perhaps the most surprising theoretical
feature of the <em>Policraticus</em> is its treatment of the
relationship between secular and spiritual spheres and powers. John is
not a strictly &lsquo;hierocratic&rsquo; thinker, if that term denotes
the claim that all political authority flows from God through the
church to earthly rulers, so that the use of power is always to be
regulated and limited by ecclesiastical officials. Instead, he permits
secular government to be conducted without direct interference from
the church (Nederman &amp; Campbell 1991). Like the soul in the body,
he asserts, the priesthood fixes the general aims of the healthy
political organism (namely, the conditions necessary for salvation).
But the head of the body is responsible for ensuring and supervising
the actual physical welfare of the organism as it pursues its path
through life. Thus, there exists a common good within the community
that is unique and distinct from, although conducive to, the ultimate
spiritual end of salvation. It is the promotion of this common
good&mdash;the realization of a just society on earth&mdash;that forms
the primary temporal duty of princes and of all their subjects.</p>

<p>
John believes that, at least so far as life on earth is concerned, men
play an active role in creating their own happiness both as
individuals and as political creatures. He claims that the political
system must be guided by the principles of nature, which he regards as
&ldquo;the best guide to living&rdquo; (<em>Policraticus</em>:
84&ndash;85). Yet nature does not strictly determine human behavior.
Rather, men must actively cooperate with nature by means of experience
and practice. Human beings conform to the course suggested by nature,
a feat which is accomplished by developing and perfecting their
knowledge and virtue. This is true at the personal as well as the
social level: just as humans cultivate their own individual qualities
by improving upon their natural attributes through effort and
education, so they achieve a well-ordered political community by
acknowledging and performing the natural duties demanded by justice
toward their fellow creatures. Nature may fix the path of the good
life, but men must exercise their minds and wills so as to discover
and follow this route.</p>

<p>
Thus, John&rsquo;s political and moral philosophies are inextricably
interwoven. Nowhere is this more evident than in his notion of
moderation, especially as the salient characteristic of the good ruler
described in the <em>Policraticus.</em> John&rsquo;s king exercises
power in a moderate fashion, neither releasing his subjects wholly to
the caprice of their own volition nor controlling their behavior so
strenuously that they become incapable of using their legitimate free
will (<em>Policraticus</em>: 49&ndash;54). Royal moderation is
equivalent to respect for the proper sphere of liberty which belongs
to each and every member of the political community. By contrast,
immoderate conduct is regarded by John as the defining mark of
tyranny. The discussion of tyranny is one of the best known and most
influential features of the <em>Policraticus.</em> Unlike preceding
classical and medieval authors, who conceived of tyranny purely in
terms of the evil or destructive use of public authority, John
identifies the tyrant as someone who weds the ambitious desire to
curtail the liberty of others with the power to accomplish this goal.
The prince, as the pinnacle of temporal political organization,
represents both the ordinary assurance of the security and liberty of
his subjects and the authoritative source of earthly law and
jurisdiction within his realm. Thus, a tyrant is inevitably
accompanied by the destruction of the other parts of the community as
well. In order to combat the threat of tyranny, John believes that the
other members of the polity are charged with a duty&mdash;stemming
from the principle of justice itself&mdash;to criticize, correct and,
if necessary, even to kill a tyrannical ruler (<em>Policraticus</em>:
25, 206&ndash;213; Nederman 1988). Moreover, he takes this duty to be
a generalized one: it pertains not merely to royal magistrates but to
all segments of the body politic, since all are equally obligated (by
their membership in society) to enforce the terms of justice.</p>

<h2 id="IbnRush">4. Ibn Rushd</h2>

<p>
Philosophy, in all its different varieties (including metaphysics,
natural philosophy, and psychology), thrived in medieval Islamic Spain
(al-Andalus), although it also experienced periodic theological
backlashes. From the very beginning of the Islamic age, one of the
earliest Umayyad Caliphs of Spain, Al-Hakam II (961&ndash;976 CE),
promoted the study of philosophy (<em>falsafa</em>) and science and
encouraged translations of texts from Greek into Arabic (Black 2011).
Greek ethical and political texts were included among those that could
be studied in the library of Al-Hakam, such as Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Laws</em> and <em>Republic</em> (Black 2011: 118).</p>

<p>
After the end of the Umayyad rule in Spain, different (and often
unstable) political regimes were established from the eleventh until
the beginning of the twelfth century. Then, in 1106, the Almoravids, a
dynasty originating in Northern Africa, brought together several
Berber tribes, and conquered medieval Spain (Black 2011:
118&ndash;119). The Almoravids opposed developments in philosophy,
defended literalism in the reading of sacred and jurisprudential
texts, and championed Sunni orthodoxy against Sufism and other
movements that were considered heterodox. In 1145, the
Almoravids&rsquo; power in Spain was overthrown by the rise of a new
dynasty that, like the former, had consolidated its power first in the
Maghreb: the Almohads. The latter had previously been under the
leadership of Ibn T&#363;mart (c. 1080&ndash;1130 CE), a Berber who
had studied in Baghdad. He was considered a <em>mahd&#299;</em> (a
traditional sacred figure in Shia Islam) who was said to have spoken
to the great Islamic theologian al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; (Black 2011:
118&ndash;119). After Ibn T&#363;mart, the Almohads paid particular
attention to moral reform but rejected literalism and the strict
interpretations of sharia and the theology promoted by the Almoravids,
thus favoring once again the development of philosophy and the arts,
albeit in a regime of rigorous moral and religious reform. The rise of
the Almohads in Muslim Spain had a great impact on the lives of two of
the most important philosophers of al-Andalus, the Islamic thinker Ibn
Rushd (1126&ndash;1198 CE), and the Jewish thinker Moses Maimonides
(1138&ndash;1204 CE). Indeed, while Ibn Rushd contributed to the
cultural revolution promoted by the Almohads, as part of the cultural
elite (the <em>talaba</em>) that the new dynasty formed in Marrakesh
(Fierro 2018; Geoffroy 1999), the establishment of their power in
Cordoba, and the decision that all Jews and Christians must convert to
Islam, led to the exile of Maimonides among many others.</p>

<p>
Ibn Rushd (1126&ndash;1198 CE), often Latinized as Averroes, lived in
Muslim al-Andalus and was an influential judge (<em>qadi</em>),
theologian, and philosopher who is considered to be one of the
greatest representatives of medieval Muslim philosophy. (For a more
complete account of his contributions, see the entry on
 <a href="../ibn-rushd/">Ibn Rushd</a>.)
 His commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s works, many of which were
translated into Latin, earned him the title of &ldquo;The
Commentator&rdquo; in the Christian world. Some ideas of Ibn Rushd
about metaphysics, psychology, and natural philosophy have indirect
political implications. For example, he continued the line of thought
proposed by Ibn Bajja (Latinized as Avempace) in the Andalusian
context concerning the solitary nature of the philosopher. He also
advances an account of theoretical perfection according to which a
sage can ensure the complete actualization of the ideal forms of the
intellect to perfect philosophy (Brenet 2006: 478&ndash;482). This
theory is also confirmed in Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s <em>Decisive
Treatise</em>, which seems to follow al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; in
maintaining that the truths of philosophy are accessible only to a
minority of people and that philosophical knowledge itself can be made
accessible to the masses only in the form of religious beliefs.
However, his philosophical elitism is not always so strict because it
also remains open to the possibility that collectivities can
contribute to wisdom. This latter interpretation would also more
easily explain those passages of the <em>Decisive Treatise</em> in
which Ibn Rushd speaks about the formation of the sciences and arts as
a collective effort pursued by successive generations of human beings.
In fact, in his commentary on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, Ibn
Rushd further argues that it is impossible or unlikely for one man to
achieve all intellectual and moral virtues without the help of a
multitude of other human beings (Ibn Rushd <em>Republic B</em>:
5).</p>

<p>
In his commentaries on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, Ibn Rushd provides the bulk of his
political philosophy. His commentary on the <em>Ethics</em> is
considered a middle commentary, meaning that therein, he very often
paraphrases Aristotle&rsquo;s work (for more on how Ibn Rushd
undertakes this paraphrasis, see Harvey &amp; Woerther 2014). While
the full version of the original Arabic text is now lost, the
commentary was translated into Latin by Hermannus Alemannus in 1240 as
well as into Hebrew (by Samuel ben Judah of Marseille) in 1322. In the
<em>Epilogue</em> of this commentary and at the beginning of his
<em>Paraphrasis</em> or commentary on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>,
Ibn Rushd discusses the epistemological status of ethics and politics.
For him, ethics and politics are practical sciences and, following
Aristotle, he claims that practical and theoretical sciences are
distinct in that the former are aimed at action and, unlike the
latter, are not concerned with necessity but with entities that are
contingent and possible (Woerther 2018: 227). Moreover, Ibn Rushd
compares the status of ethics and politics to the two different
components of the medical sciences: the question of what constitutes
health and illness and consideration of how health is secured and
illness is cured (Woerther 2018: 224). Likewise, ethics analyzes
actions in general by investigating how habits are acquired along with
the relationship between action, will and behavior, whereas politics
studies how these habits are related to the soul and can be realized
and perfected (Woerther 2018: 224&ndash;225).</p>

<p>
Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s commentary on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>
probably dates to 1194, i.e., one year before he was sent into exile
for reasons that were never completely clarified but that presumably
have to do with the complex relationships between traditional and more
forward-looking legal scholars present at the Caliph&rsquo;s court. As
in the case of the <em>Ethics</em> commentary, the original text of
the commentary on the <em>Republic</em> is lost, meaning we only have
a Hebrew translation (by Samuel ben Judah between 1320 and 1322) and a
Latin translation (by Elija del Medigo at the end of the fifteenth
century). Therefore, the commentary enjoyed a certain influence among
later medieval Jewish authors. The paraphrase is a middle commentary
and thus contains a literal report of many Platonic ideas. In fact,
there are numerous questions about the kind of relationship that Ibn
Rushd established with Plato&rsquo;s text. We cannot even be sure that
he read the actual text of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> (if he did,
he certainly read it in an Arabic translation since he knew no Greek)
or if he had access to the Platonic text through the paraphrasis of
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> that had been authored by the great
Greek physician Galen (Belo 2009). The commentary is divided into
three different treatises: Parts I and II are on the virtuous and
ideal state and are concerned with the education of the young and the
philosopher-king, while Part III deals with non-virtuous states. In
his commentary, Ibn Rushd tells us that &ldquo;since Aristotle&rsquo;s
book on governance [the <em>Politics</em>] has not yet fallen into our
hands&rdquo; (Ibn Rushd <em>Republic B</em>: 4), he had decided to
comment on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> as a substitute.</p>

<p>
Ibn Rushd does not limit himself to commenting on Plato&rsquo;s ideas,
but also engages with them in original ways. For example, the whole
commentary is based on the idea that there is a strong relationship
between Plato&rsquo;s ideas and what Ibn Rushd defines as &ldquo;our
divine law&rdquo;, that is, Islamic law (Ibn Rushd <em>Republic
B</em>: 12). Nevertheless, scholars disagree as to the nature of this
relationship, with some arguing that it is a matter of harmony
(Rosenthal 1953) and others suggesting that it is more one of tension
(Gauthier 1909; Namazi 2022). On several key topics, such as the
virtues of the philosopher-king, war, women, crime and punishment, he
subtly complements Plato&rsquo;s ideas by providing his own
interpretations and does so while taking into account the particular
audience he is addressing. An example of this strategy can be found
when he talks about the condition of women in the commonwealth. Ibn
Rush restates the proto-feminist ideas of Plato in the
<em>Republic</em>, claiming that women should also be allowed to be
guardians. In fact, Ibn Rushd claims that &ldquo;the nature of men and
women is of one kind&rdquo; and he stresses, based on this notion, the
&ldquo;the women in this city will practice the [same] activities as
the men, except that they are weaker at it&rdquo; (Ibn Rushd
<em>Republic B</em>: 58). This means that, as in Plato, women can
follow the same educational path as men and become guardians of the
ideal city-state. However, Ibn Rush also complements Plato&rsquo;s
argument by saying that a cost-benefit advantage accrues from
including women in government and the affairs of the city. As he
explains, since women do not participate in any activity in the cities
of al-Andalus, they have come to resemble &ldquo;plants&rdquo; and
become a &ldquo;burden&rdquo; which was &ldquo;one of the causes of
the poverty of these cities&rdquo; (<em>Republic B</em>: 59).</p>

<p>
Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s text also provides several references to the
political reality of al-Andalus. For example, in the third book, at
92.4&ndash;8 (<em>Republic B</em>: 124&ndash;125), Ibn Rushd claims
that the kingdom of the Almoravids declined due to its transformation
from a &ldquo;governance based on the <em>nomos</em>&rdquo; into a
timocracy and then into a government based on hedonism until it
ultimately perished. Ibn Rushd also criticizes the government of his
own times, i.e., those of the Almohads, by saying that their power had
declined into a timocracy (<em>Republic B</em>: 121 and 145). Mention
must also be made of Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s theory of democracy, which is
different from that of al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;. While for
F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, democracy was lawless (and was thus a synonym
for anarchy), Ibn Rushd sees democracy as a government in which the
law plays a role. He also refers to Cordoba and other contemporary
cities as examples of democracies. After saying that democratic cities
are not stable and perish rapidly, he adds that this is &ldquo;the
case with democratic cities existing in this time of ours and in that
which preceded [it]&rdquo; (<em>Republic B</em>: 127), a likely
reference to the regimes of <em>taifas</em> in
al-Andalus&mdash;independent cities and regimes that emerged
periodically after the end of Caliphate periods. In fact, Ibn Rushd
explicitly defines Cordoba as a &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; regime that
had then fallen into tyranny under the Almohads (<em>Republic B</em>:
133).</p>

<p>
Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s philosophical and political ideas also exerted an
important influence in the Christian world, especially among
philosophers and writers who supported pro-imperial ideals (Gilson
1948; Marenbon 2001; Nardi 1960). Philosophers as diverse as John of
Jandun c. 1285&ndash;1328) and Antonio Pelacani da Parma (c.
1275&ndash;1328), who were strongly influenced by Ibn Rushd but did
not write specifically political works, were close to the Italian
Ghibelline and pro-Empire milieu (Brenet 2019; Calma 2015). Moreover,
two major Christian theorists and writers of the beginning of the
fourteenth century, Dante Alighieri and Marsilius of Padua, drew on
ideas of Ibn Rushd to legitimize their pro-Empire ideas against the
papal claim to the plenitude of power, i.e., the idea that the power
of temporal rulers should depend on the papacy or ecclesiastical
authorities. However, the debate is still open among scholars whether
Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s ideas led to the development of a political
Averroist tradition (Mulieri 2019; Syros 2012).</p>

<h2 id="MoseMaim">5. Moses Maimonides</h2>

<p>
Moses Maimonides (1138&ndash;1204) is perhaps the greatest Jewish
thinkers of the Middle Ages. Originally from Cordoba, al-Andalus, on
account of the Almohad conquest of al-Andalus he had to move to Egypt
in 1166, where he achieved fame as a Rabbinic scholar, philosopher and
physician. (A more detailed account of his career is provided by the
entry on
 <a href="../maimonides/">Maimonides</a>.)
 Among Maimonides&rsquo; writings, we may single out the <em>Mishneh
Torah</em>, a massive compendium of Jewish law which is a major
reference work in rabbinic literature, and the <em>Guide of the
Perplexed</em>, composed in Judeo-Arabic, his most important
philosophical text, which was influenced by neo-Platonic and
Aristotelian philosophy, and which had a considerable impact on
medieval and early modern philosophy. Maimonides&rsquo; political
philosophy is mostly contained in the latter work (although it is also
scattered among minor texts such as the early <em>Treatise on the Art
of Logic</em>) and aims to integrate the Greek neo-Platonism of
Islamic authors such as al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; with the study of
Jewish Divine law in the Torah. Maimonides provides his own definition
of political science in the <em>Treatise on the Art of Logic</em>, in
which he states that philosophy or science is divided into theoretical
and practical philosophy. While the former include mathematics,
physics, and theology or metaphysics, practical philosophy (which is
sometimes translated as political science) is divided into: (1) the
&ldquo;self-governance of human beings&rdquo;; (2) the
&ldquo;governance of the household&rdquo;; (3) the &ldquo;governance
of the city&rdquo;; and (4) the &ldquo;governance of the nation&rdquo;
(<em>Art of Logic</em>: 14). The narrow domain of political science,
i.e., the governance of the city, &ldquo;imparts to its citizens
knowledge of true happiness and imparts to them the [way of] striving
to achieve it&rdquo; (<em>Art of Logic</em>: 190). In other words,
practical and political sciences are prerequisites for the pursuit of
theoretical happiness, which is the aim of philosophical life.</p>

<p>
As was the case in al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, the relationship between
philosophical and practical life plays a crucial role in
Maimonides&rsquo; <em>Guide of the Perplexed</em>. Maimonides is also
an Aristotelian and is therefore convinced that the natural needs and
wants of the body (which also motivated, and in turn made possible,
the natural association culminating in society) are essential in
creating the conditions for the pursuit of intellectual happiness,
which is the highest form of human perfection (<em>Perplexed</em>:
II.36; III.51). However, Maimonides does not consistently pursue the
model of solitary intellectual confinement that can be found, for
example, in Ibn Bajja&rsquo;s idea of the sage (and, to a certain
extent, in Ibn Rushd). In fact, he maintains that the philosopher has
the natural and ethical duty to extend a certain measure of his
intellectual happiness to the masses who are not philosophers and who
will be able to access philosophical truths only imperfectly according
to their abilities and in the form of religious beliefs. Since
religious beliefs define a society which is shaped by Judaism and
therefore shape its legalistic dimensions, the study of the laws and
norms that govern society is fundamental to understanding how
theoretical happiness can be spread to the whole of society. This is
why, following al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, Maimonides maintains that the
philosopher must also be a prophet and a lawmaker. The
philosopher-legislator-prophet makes the intellectual truths of
philosophy known to non-philosophers in society in a simpler and more
literal way by evoking the imagination, which is a faculty of
knowledge capable of making philosophical truths known to people who
are not philosophers. Therefore, the teaching of divine law must aim
to perfect both the welfare of the soul and the welfare of the body.
Yet, the ideal philosophical life of the sage should not be extended
to the masses because if adopted by people who are not philosophers,
the stability of society, which needs the support of political life in
order to sustain its main aim of pursuing philosophical life, would be
undermined (<em>Perplexed</em>: II.37).</p>

<p>
Scholars (Strauss 1952; Kreisel 1999; Pines 1957) have undertaken an
important discussion of the status of political philosophy in
Maimonides&rsquo; thought and in comparison with other Islamic and
Jewish authors. There is also debate about whether it is even possible
to speak of the existence of a political philosophy in medieval Jewish
authors and, if so, how to characterize it (Lorberbaum 2003; Melamed
1993, 2005; Strauss 1935; Syros 2020). There is no doubt that in the
Jewish tradition, as in the Islamic one, political themes are always
intertwined with metaphysics or divine law. Maimonides is a good
example of this tendency and also demonstrates an original
appropriation of many previous themes from Islamic philosophy. One
important difference between Maimonides&rsquo; idea of the
philosopher-prophet and lawmaker, as contrasted with the thought of
both al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299; and Ibn Rushd, is that the latter tend
to identify the philosopher-lawmaker-legislator with the king whereas
Maimonides partially modifies this identification, applying the label
of king only to Moses and to no other prophet in the Jewish tradition.
Compared to Ibn Bajja&rsquo;s and Averroes&rsquo; reinstatement of the
Platonic idea of the philosopher-king, Maimonides appears to advocate
a more positive view of the attitude of the philosopher-prophet toward
the masses. As in al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, the prophet-philosopher
for Maimonides fulfills a moral obligation to improve the education
and knowledge of the masses who are, in turn, led to follow him as an
example and model. This is because, as he writes, &ldquo;an individual
can only attain all this through a political association, it being
already known that man is political by nature&rdquo;
(<em>Perplexed</em>: II.511). Based on his idea that only Moses can be
king, Maimonides also proposes an ideal polity in which Moses is the
main leader insofar as he is a prophet, a judge, and a king, where the
Torah is the constitution and the Sanhedrin, a Jewish juridical and
administrative body, is assigned legislative and judicial functions
that can lead to changes in the laws.</p>

<p>
<em>The Guide of the Perplexed</em> not only influenced the Jewish
tradition but was also translated into Latin as <em>Dux neutrorum</em>
and enjoyed wide circulation during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries at the University of Paris. For example, Vasileios Syros has
pointed out a clear echo of Maimonides&rsquo; concept of civil
religion in Marsilius of Padua&rsquo;s <em>Defensor Pacis</em> (Syros
2011b).</p>

<h2 id="ThomAqui">6. Thomas Aquinas</h2>

<p>
Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225&ndash;1274) is generally considered to be the
towering figure of thirteenth-century philosophy. A man of prodigious
learning, he turned his pen with equal vigor to virtually every branch
of knowledge under discussion in his time, including political
philosophy. (His life and writings are recounted in the entry on
 <a href="../aquinas/">Thomas Aquinas</a>.)
 Aquinas emerged as the leading exponent of the idea that the
teachings of the pagan Aristotle were consistent with the tenets of
the Christian faith. Hence, he upheld the capacity of reason
unilluminated by divine revelation to grasp truths about nature (and
even some about God); yet he remained committed to the view that
certain truths (indeed, the higher insights into the mysteries of
divinity) were accessible only by way of direct experience of God as
found in Scripture.</p>

<p>
Making a case for Aquinas as a political philosopher proves somewhat
more difficult than it might seem at first glance. Certainly, many
scholars have identified him as &ldquo;<em>the</em> one great thinker
of the Middle Ages&rdquo;, an interpretation, however, that &ldquo;is
an invention of modern neo-Thomism&rdquo; and that &ldquo;would have
startled anyone at the University of Paris in the thirteenth
century&rdquo; (Tierney 1987: 646; see also Briguglia 2018:
55&ndash;65). The study of political ideas was in fact tangential to
Aquinas&rsquo;s overarching enterprise. He was first and foremost a
theologian whose primary concern was the investigation of the
boundaries between Christian faith and revelation, on the one hand,
and rational philosophical inquiry, on the other. Consequently,
Aquinas&rsquo;s remarks on the social and political order must be
extracted mainly from arguments embedded in his theological and
philosophical writings.</p>

<p>
Aquinas&rsquo;s reflections about politics are spread throughout a
variety of genres typical of scholasticism. For instance, he composed
an attenuated commentary on the initial two-plus books of the
<em>Politics</em>, the intellectual value of which some scholars now
tend to dismiss in preference to its continuation by Peter of Auvergne
(Lanza 2021: cixl-clxxxvi). His other main stand-alone contribution to
political thought, <em>On Kingship</em>, was a fragment on the nature
of government, especially royal and tyrannical regimes, as its title
suggests. The text of the latter breaks off early in Book 2, left to
be finished up in a total of four books under the title <em>On the
Government of Rulers</em> (<em>De regimine principum</em>) by Ptolemy
of Lucca. The most sustained analysis of political themes, however, is
located in Aquinas&rsquo;s massive <em>Summa Theologiae</em>. There is
no single section of the <em>Summa</em> which encapsulates the whole
of his political philosophy. Rather, he touches on various questions
pertaining to politics in the midst of relevant theological
discussions. Therefore, we should look upon the <em>Summa</em> not as
a cohesive statement of Aquinas&rsquo;s political teachings but as
further evidence of how political philosophy for him cannot be
properly detached from its broader theological framework.</p>

<p>
As perhaps the most prominent philosopher of the thirteenth century to
integrate the newly discovered learning from Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophical corpus (the <em>Ethics</em> and <em>Politics</em> were
among the last Aristotelian works to be translated into Latin) into
Christian doctrine, Aquinas promoted the value of naturalistic
rationalism. In other words, the rational capacity possessed by human
beings, far from being incompatible with supernatural enlightenment,
attains its full potentiality with divine assistance. The politically
interesting corollary to this position is that the presently corrupt
condition of human nature does not constitute its total perversion.
Instead, post-lapsarian humans are an incomplete image of how God
created humanity in its original condition, prior to the Fall from
grace occasioned by Adam and Eve. Even in a state of perfect
innocence, Aquinas suggests, there would have been individual
differences of age, gender, and intellect that required attention and
which would have qualified some people for leadership. Such a
preeminent authority existed to facilitate the common good and would
have been necessary even before the Fall (ST Ia 96 A3&ndash;4
[<em>APW</em>: 2&ndash;4]). Aquinas thus tacitly accepts that
political life is an essential feature of humanity&rsquo;s original
and therefore natural condition. The foundations of government are
detached from the idea (found in St. Augustine of Hippo, for instance)
that political authority came into existence as a by-product of
original sin in order to remedy its consequences. Aquinas preferred to
assimilate politics to human nature as divinely created&mdash;a
Christianization of the Aristotelian teaching in <em>Politics</em>
1253a2&ndash;3 that man is a &ldquo;political animal&rdquo; (DR bk 1
ch I [<em>APW</em>: 5&ndash;6])&mdash;and as such would have existed
even if the Fall had never occurred (see Toivanen 2021). By
implication, the exercise of political power had a purpose in and of
itself, and so did not depend for its legitimacy upon the approval of
the church.</p>

<p>
In Aquinas&rsquo;s account of politics, the desire for achieving the
common good, which brings humans together initially, is conditioned by
natural inequalities. He begins with the principle, which contains
echoes of Book 1 of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em>, that the
disparities that give rise to government and law are themselves part
of a divinely ordained scheme embedded in nature. Aquinas thereby
posits a direct connection between irremediable natural differences
and the emergence of political communities. Since inequalities are
unalterable by individual human beings, they must be redressed at the
level of politics for the common good. Not all people were created
equal in the sight of God; for precisely this reason, Aquinas can
claim for the secular political realm a unique set of natural ends
that move beyond the remediation of sin.</p>

<p>
Throughout his writings related to political matters, Aquinas
manifested substantial interest in the various forms of constitutional
order, especially as classified and evaluated by Aristotle (Tierney
1979; Blythe 1986; Aroney 2007). The structure of the first book of
<em>On Kingship</em> suggests that he intended to examine monarchy
more from the perspective of the governed. Aquinas indicates that the
community is prior to kingship and that royal power is justified
solely by its function of maintaining communal bonds. This viewpoint
may be seen in many of the fundamental claims proposed in <em>On
Kingship</em>. Aquinas asserts that the reference point for judging a
well-governed community arises by reference to the common good (DR bk
1 ch II [<em>APW</em>: 8]). Aquinas captures the common Greek
distinction made in Aristotle between rule by the one, the few, and
the many as a way of classifying both good (kingship, aristocracy,
polity) and evil (tyranny, oligarchy, democracy) constitutions. But he
goes on to adapt the language of oppression&mdash;a residue stemming
from Isidore of Seville&rsquo;s <em>Etymologies</em> (Nederman 2019:
6&ndash;7)&mdash;to the effect that oligarchy and democracy are
counted as collective tyrannies rather than corrupt systems structured
according to their own unique misunderstandings about justice, as in
the <em>Politics</em> (DR bk 1 ch II [<em>APW</em>: 8&ndash;9]). Thus,
both the socio-economic dimension of Aristotle&rsquo;s analysis of
oligarchic and democratic regimes, and his attempt to see such
constitutions as internally related less to one another than to their
opposite number, are submerged by Aquinas&rsquo;s presentation.</p>

<p>
An emphasis on tyranny is to be expected in a treatise devoted to
kingship, as it was in John of Salisbury&rsquo;s
<em>Policraticus</em>. Indeed, in a later chapter of <em>On
Kingship</em>, Aquinas engages in a tyrannology that touches on the
other imperfect regimes only inasmuch as they are instructive for the
understanding of the evils of the tyrant and the perfection of the
king (DR bk 1 ch XI [<em>APW</em>: 30&ndash;34]). Accepting
Aristotle&rsquo;s ranking of the best and worst systems within both
ideal and corrupt constitutions, Aquinas sets out to excoriate the
tyrant. Here it may seem that he is less harsh concerning oligarchy
and, especially, democracy in comparison with tyranny. The tyrant
appears to constitute such an evil for the community that any polity
would gladly accept democracy (or even oligarchy) over tyranny (DR bk
1 ch IV [<em>APW</em>: 12&ndash;13]). But the force of this case is
merely rhetorical. In fact, Aquinas soon points out that there are
gradations even within forms of tyranny. &ldquo;If monarchy is changed
into tyranny&rdquo;, he proposes, &ldquo;less evil flows from this
than when the government of a number of men becomes corrupt&rdquo; (DR
bk 1 ch VI [<em>APW</em>: 16]). He reasons that the corruption
engendered by oligarchy or democracy leads to internal dissension
within the community, which is ultimately more harmful than the rule
of a single evil man, who may be less inclined to &ldquo;set about
oppressing his subjects and become an extreme tyrant&rdquo;. Likewise,
Aquinas follows Aristotle in observing that historical study of the
origins of tyrannical regimes demonstrates that they are more likely
to arise from societies in which a multitude rather than a monarch
previously ruled (DR bk 1 ch VI [<em>APW</em>: 17]). In sum, Aquinas
wishes no one to infer from his statements about democracy and
oligarchy that he is &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on them or has afforded any
grounds to prefer them to the government of kings, or even
&ldquo;moderate&rdquo; tyrants. The argument that one should refrain
from living under a kingship, the best of regimes, because it might
turn into the worst of constitutions, tyranny, is wholly specious, in
Aquinas&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>
The attitude toward constitutional systems in the <em>Summa</em>
diverges in some respects from the position one finds in <em>On
Kingship</em> (Blythe 1992: 40&ndash;41). In the <em>Summa</em>,
Aquinas&rsquo;s stated preference for the ideal government is
Aristotle&rsquo;s mixed constitution or &ldquo;polity&rdquo; rather
than kingship. Moreover, he seems to regard the mixed system as a
hybrid of several types of regimes that in the <em>Politics</em> are
incommensurable. &ldquo;Such a polity is the best form of
government&rdquo;, he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
inasmuch as it is a benign mixture of kingship, because there is one
man who presides; of aristocracy, because it is the rule of several
according to virtue; and of democracy, that is, popular power, because
the rulers can be elected from the people and it is up to the people
to elect the rulers. (ST IaIIae 105 A1 responsio [<em>APW</em>:
54])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Aquinas, this form of government corresponds to that
instituted by Moses and his successors according to divine
authorization. The Aristotelian imperfection ascribed to democracy is
thus erased by Aquinas and replaced by the legitimation of popular
rule as a valid, if not ideal or perfect, system (Blythe 1992:
51&ndash;54). Later, in the same chapter of the <em>Summa</em>, Thomas
apparently contradicts the remarks made in <em>On Kingship</em>
concerning the relation between tyranny, kingship and rule by larger
groups: &ldquo;Because the power granted to a king is so great, it is
easy for kingship to degenerate into tyranny &hellip;&rdquo; (ST
IaIIae 105 A1 ad 2 [<em>APW</em>: 55]). Thereafter, Aquinas evinces
the Isidore-tinged fear about the oppression wrought by the tyrant,
only now he views this as a rationale for the selection of rulers from
&ldquo;among the people&rdquo;, so that there would be a constant
(democratic) check upon any temptation to indulge in tyrannical
behavior (ST IaIIae 105 A1 ad 4 [<em>APW</em>: 56]).</p>

<p>
Aquinas&rsquo;s single most influential, yet also most vexed,
contribution to the history of political philosophy is his conception
of law, and especially natural law, as it appears primarily in the
<em>Summa</em> (e.g., Goerner 1979, 1983, 1990; Hall 1990; MacIntyre
2006: 41&ndash;63; McCormick 2018; Farrell 2023). He distinguished
between two senses of &ldquo;law&rdquo;, designated by the Latin words
<em lang="la">lex</em> and <em lang="la">ius</em>, which, for purposes
of clarity, are ordinarily rendered into English as &ldquo;law&rdquo;
and &ldquo;right&rdquo; respectively. Both are manifestations of
divine decree but perform distinct functions in his thought. Aquinas
defines <em lang="la">lex</em> as &ldquo;a kind of rule or measure of
acts, by which someone is induced to act or restrained from
acting&rdquo; (ST IaIIae 90 A1 responsio [<em>APW</em>: 77]). By
contrast, <em lang="la">ius</em> constitutes the end to which the
virtue of justice aspires, that is, an equalized or balanced
relationship between men based on the Roman law principle of
&ldquo;rendering to each his due&rdquo; (ST IIaIIae 58 A1 responsio
[<em>APW</em>:169]). These two meanings of law are distinct but
interrelated: &ldquo;<em lang="la">Lex</em> is not the same as <em lang="la">ius</em>,
properly speaking, but an expression of the idea
of <em lang="la">ius</em>&rdquo; (ST IIaIIae 57 A1 ad 2 [<em>APW</em>:
160]). Law, as distinguished from right, is a conscious enactment of a
reasoned will, the object of which is a common good (ST IaIIae 91 A1
responsio and ST IaIIae 93 A1 responsio [<em>APW</em>: 84, 102]).</p>
<!-- so far on APW -->

<p>
Aquinas classifies law according to four primary forms: eternal,
divine, natural and human. Eternal law reflects God&rsquo;s rational
volition for the good of all His creation. Divine law is propounded to
the human race alone by virtue of its unique capacity for salvation
(ST IaIIae 91 A4 ad 1 [<em>APW</em>: 90]). Natural law
&ldquo;participates&rdquo; in eternal and divine law inasmuch as the
reason divinely implanted in every human being&mdash;Christians and
unbelievers of all sorts alike&mdash;is oriented toward the well-being
of mankind as a whole (ST IaIIae 91 A2 [<em>APW</em>: 86&ndash;87]).
Finally, human law encompasses specific applications of the precepts
of natural law for the benefit of the members of various temporal
communities (ST IaIIae 95 A2 [<em>APW</em>: 130&ndash;31]). These
distinct modes of law must be seen in terms of the theological context
in which Aquinas works. Since he attributes to secular authority
certain wholly natural functions apart from the remediation of sin, he
is compelled to offer a precise relationship between the divine order
and the conditions of mere mortal humans. He must provide a reply, in
short, to the question: What position does the government by and for
men occupy in relation to the rest of God&rsquo;s ordained creation
and to God Himself?</p>

<p>
Aquinas&rsquo;s answer is embedded in his systematization of
<em>lex</em> (and its connection to <em>ius</em>) posited in the
<em>Summa</em>. The eternal law, according to which God rules the
universe, constitutes the foundation for all other categories of law,
since the &ldquo;rational pattern of the Divine wisdom bears the
character of law in relation to all things which are moved by
it&rdquo; (ST IaIIae 93 A2 [<em>APW</em>: 102] In non-rational
creatures, this is manifested by their implanted instincts, which urge
them to play their divinely ordained role in creation. Since
man&rsquo;s nature includes a non-rational element, all humans
participate directly in eternal law through their inclinations toward
self-preservation and the perpetuation of the species, neither of
which are pursued consciously (ST IaIIae 93 A5 [<em>APW</em>: 110]).
In addition, by virtue of the uniquely human possession of reason,
Aquinas asserts, men also enjoy the opportunity to cooperate actively
in the realization of divine law, insofar as their rational powers
allow them to partake in God&rsquo;s decrees by recognizing
consciously His hand at work. So to the extent that rational creatures
are capable of apprehending the divine scheme, and hence consciously
participating in it, eternal and divine law are manifested in natural
law (ST IaIIae 93 A2 [<em>APW</em>: 104&ndash;5]). Natural law
captures Aquinas&rsquo;s insight that men do not merely follow
God&rsquo;s commands mindlessly, but instead conduct themselves
according to law because they comprehend their place in creation. This
is the case regardless of whether they are aware of the existence of
the One True God, inasmuch as all human beings (no matter their
religious convictions) are endowed by reason.</p>

<p>
In turn, men apply natural law in particular and concrete ways by
formulating their own legal codes appropriate to the immediate
circumstances in which they find themselves, which Aquinas labels
human (or sometimes positive) law. What distinguishes human statute
from natural law is its specificity, the former supplementing the
latter and relaxing (or even dispensing with) its provisions as
required. Since natural law simply affords a rational guide for human
activity, such modifications are not contrary to its spirit (ST IaIIae
97 A1 [<em>APW</em>: 150&ndash;1]). On the contrary, the translation
of the universal dictates of natural law into the particulars of human
law furthers the realization of the very point of law: the advancement
of the common good&mdash;in this case, of the earthly political
community (ST IaIIae 96 A1 [<em>APW</em>: 138&ndash;9]). That is,
natural law and human law intersect in setting the correct standards
that determine how members of a communal order (whether the human race
as a whole or a given system of temporal government) shall conduct
themselves in order to realize their divinely consecrated purposes. If
human law does not cohere with the end of the common benefit, as
enshrined in natural law by the divine will, it would not merit the
title of law at all, since it would undermine the basis on which law
itself rests. Consequently, Aquinas suggests in the <em>Summa</em>
that positive statutes not in accordance with natural law and common
good have no binding claim on obedience, since &ldquo;such laws do not
bind in the court of conscience (<em>synderesis</em>)&rdquo; (ST
IaIIae 96 A4 responsio [<em>APW</em>: 144]; on conscience, see the
entry on
 <a href="../aquinas-moral-political/">Aquinas&rsquo; moral, political, and legal philosophy</a>).
 Indeed, they may be refused and resisted by those on whom they are
imposed, provided that such a refusal would not result in some still
greater evil (ST IaIIae 96 A5 [<em>APW</em>: 146]). In sum,
Aquinas&rsquo;s theory of law yields a systematic conceptualization of
a hierarchy of legal order, grounded in Christian principles, yet
sufficiently flexible as to permit the variations among legal codes
that characterize different human communities.</p>

<h2 id="PtolLucc">7. Ptolemy of Lucca</h2>

<p>
Thomas Aquinas started but never finished writing his treatise <em>On
Kingship</em>, as previously mentioned. Rather, the work&rsquo;s
completion (around 1300) was left to his student Ptolemy of Lucca (c.
1236&ndash;c. 1327) and disseminated under the title <em>On the
Government of Rulers</em> (<em>De regimine principum</em>). Unlike his
teacher, Ptolemy was not primarily a philosopher or professional
scholar. Instead, he served in a number of roles within the Dominican
Order and died as bishop of Torcello (Blythe 2009a). Likewise, his
literary output was not typically scholastic. Instead, Ptolemy mainly
composed historical treatises (including a universal history of the
Roman church) and biographies of important ecclesiastical figures
(Blythe 2009b). In many ways, the views he articulated in <em>On the
Government of Rulers</em> reflect and apply his historically minded
orientation to salient issues of political philosophy. Although
originally attributed <em>in toto</em> to Aquinas, Ptolemy&rsquo;s
contribution to <em>On the Government of Rulers</em> sets a decidedly
different tone than the chapters now ascribed to his teacher.
Specifically, while <em>On Kingship</em> defended the superiority of
monarchical regimes, the continuation authored by Ptolemy is now
widely regarded as one of the premiere medieval defenses of
republicanism, and of republican Rome in particular. Ptolemy praised
republican institutions as &ldquo;more suitable for producing a
certain civility&rdquo; and argued that God rewarded the ancient
Romans for their civic virtue and just system of laws (<em>On the
Government of Rulers</em>: 121).</p>

<p>
In spite of this veneration of Rome, scholars have generally asserted
that the fundamental principles undergirding Ptolemy&rsquo;s political
theory stem from his devotion to Aristotelian scholasticism (Davis
1984: 231 note 21, 278; Canning 1996: 148&ndash;149; Blythe 2002:
135). Yet he looks to historical Rome rather than to Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Politics</em> for the quintessential example of the best form of
government. Ptolemy&rsquo;s arguments rest very heavily on his
impressive (for its time) knowledge of Roman political institutions,
leading figures, and history. Indeed, it would not be too great a
stretch to assert that, in comparison with other prominent political
thinkers of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the
level of knowledge about Rome in the republican period displayed in
<em>On the Government of Rulers</em> is virtually without parallel. In
addition to standard Latin sources for the history of the Republic,
such as Cicero, Sallust, Vegetius, and Valerius Maximus, Ptolemy mined
authorities less commonly cited in his day, such as Livy and
Eutropius. Moreover, he found ways to transform sacred texts into key
witnesses to secular history. For instance, Ptolemy provides an
ingenious rereading of Augustine&rsquo;s <em>City of God</em> 5.18
which strips out the Saint&rsquo;s moral condemnation of republican
rapaciousness and vice, replacing it with a positive valuation of the
motives behind and accomplishments of Roman patriots (Davis 1984:
57&ndash;60). Likewise, the books of Maccabees are looted as a
treasure trove of historical information about the political, social,
and physical characteristics of Rome, often employed side-by-side with
pagan sources as a confirmation or supplement. Judged by the
preponderance of the citations in Ptolemy&rsquo;s portion of <em>On
the Government of Rulers</em>, the Latin accounts of the organization
of the Republic and the conduct of its leaders, instead of
Aristotle&rsquo;s concept of <em>politeia</em> (that is, the mixed
constitution), formed the central reference point for his argument.
The superiority of the Roman Republic posited by Ptolemy provided the
salient lens through which he filtered the reading of ancient
texts&mdash;sacred as well as profane, philosophical as well as
historical.</p>

<p>
In particular, Rome embodied what Ptolemy calls &ldquo;political
lordship&rdquo; (his term for republican government, in
contradistinction to &ldquo;regal lordship&rdquo; or monarchy), which
is his preferred system of governance on account of the
&ldquo;mildness&rdquo; of its rule. In support of this position,
Ptolemy gives reasons such as the limited terms of officials, the
system of payment, the nature of citizens, and the constraints placed
by law on governmental power. Ptolemy relies on Roman sources, rather
than on Aristotle, to uphold such claims. In almost every instance
where a positive example of constitutional order is provided, it is
drawn from the ancient republic of Rome. For example, Ptolemy&rsquo;s
initial definition of political rule is followed immediately by a
reference to Roman governance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Political rule exists when a region, province, city or town is
governed by one or many according to its own statutes, as happens in
regions of Italy and especially in Rome, which for the most part has
been governed by senators and consuls ever since the city was founded.
(<em>On the Government of Rulers</em>: 120)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, Ptolemy&rsquo;s discussion of political leaders concentrates
on the Romans as providing the supreme instantiations, naming
&ldquo;ancient Roman leaders, such as Marcus Curius, Fabricius, and
many others&rdquo;, who &ldquo;took care of the Republic with their
own riches, which made them more bold and more solicitous for the care
of the polity&rdquo; (<em>On the Government of Rulers</em>:
121&ndash;122). Relying primarily on Roman sources, Ptolemy thus
argues that Rome constituted the very archetype of political rule.</p>

<p>
Ptolemy&rsquo;s interpretation of Rome&rsquo;s development coincides
with and reinforces his Christian providential account of history.
According to this view, the path of Roman governance, like that of all
earthly regimes, was directed by the hand of God toward a definite
end. One cannot escape this linear and teleological notion of history
in Ptolemy&rsquo;s thought. While the success of the Romans resulted
directly from their political and military skills and their civic
self-sacrifice, its ultimate cause was the will of God, who was
pleased by the Romans&rsquo; method of governing. Moreover, the
excellence of the Roman constitution and the virtue of its citizens
played key roles in Rome&rsquo;s achievements. But the invention of
the republican institutions that permitted the conquest of the world
was the product of divine inspiration (Ptolemy <em>On the Government
of Rulers</em>: 153&ndash;154). Ptolemy&rsquo;s admiration for the
Roman Republic is thus intimately tied to his Christian understanding
of human history. In Ptolemy&rsquo;s view, the character of the Romans
and of the Roman Republic was such that they could spread righteous
rule across the globe in preparation for Christ&rsquo;s coming. In
addition to the practical advantages of the <em>pax Romana</em> for
the spread of the Christian religion, Roman civic virtue and love of
justice promoted a benevolent and self-sacrificing spirit that
prefigured the kingdom of Christ. The historical success of Roman
government was, for Ptolemy, in no way a matter of blind natural
forces or chance, but instead reflected a providential plan directing
the course of human events toward a preordained goal.</p>

<p>
There is also a naturalistic component to the defense of the Roman
Republic in <em>On the Government of Rulers</em>. Ptolemy proposes
that government arises primarily from the material needs of mankind
and the relative vulnerability of human beings in nature. Though
citing Aristotle on the political nature of man, Ptolemy places far
more emphasis on biological and material necessity than the
Philosopher ever would:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The necessity of establishing a city comes first from a consideration
of human need, which compels a person to live in society. (<em>On the
Government of Rulers</em>: 220)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ptolemy goes on to illustrate how plants and animals have no need of
clothing or of fortifications, while humans are quite vulnerable
without them. Likewise, when struck by disease, humans require the aid
of those educated in the medical arts (<em>On the Government of
Rulers</em>: 220&ndash;221). Ptolemy ends this discussion with the
remark that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for all these reasons I conclude that the city is a necessity for
human beings, and that it is constituted on behalf of the community of
the multitude, without which humans cannot live decently. (<em>On the
Government of Rulers</em>: 221)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He thereby sets a clear naturalistic standard for the evaluation of
various regimes.</p>

<p>
The Roman Republic was for Ptolemy distinctively suited to redress the
failings of the human condition. The primary &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
duty of government is to assure that those whose preservation is
threatened are served and hence that the bonds of human society are
maintained and strengthened (Ptolemy <em>On the Government of
Rulers</em>: 181). The Romans excelled in this regard, according to
Ptolemy. Thus, they particularly merited their lordship. He identifies
three elements of the superlative virtue of Romans: love of country,
zeal for justice, and civil benevolence (Ptolemy <em>On the Government
of Rulers</em>: 154). He illustrates these three principles copiously
with citations to Roman historians and philosophers (Ptolemy <em>On
the Government of Rulers</em>: 154&ndash;162). Ptolemy aimed to
demonstrate the confluence between the qualities of Roman character
nourished in the Republic and the requirements of righteous
governance. God and Rome converged.</p>

<h2 id="CommPoli">8. Commentators on the <em>Politics</em></h2>

<p>
The first known commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> in
the Middle Ages can be found in the Byzantine milieu of the twelfth
century. Michael of Ephesus (an author from the early or middle of
that century who commented on several other works by Aristotle,
including the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>) authored some comments
(<em>scholia</em>) in which he focused on selected ideas from
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em>. Michael&rsquo;s comments are
mainly aimed at clarifying aspects of Aristotle&rsquo;s ideas but also
reflect some political and practical problems in his own time and in
the Byzantine context. For example, Michael indirectly criticizes the
imperial regime of the <em>Komnenoi (</em>the House of
Komnenos<em>)</em> in which he lived by questioning the legitimacy of
monarchy (Kaldellis 2011: 135&ndash;138). Michael&rsquo;s
<em>scholia</em> are the only extant example of a commentary-text on
the <em>Politics</em> in the Byzantine world (although there are other
authors who draw on this text in order to discuss political problems,
such as Theodoros Metochites or Theodoros II Laskaris). This suggests
that the <em>Politics</em> was perhaps not very widely known in
Byzantium.</p>

<p>
As opposed to the Islamic and Jewish contexts, where Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Politics</em> never received complete translations, its Latin
translation played an important role in Christian Europe. If, as we
saw, Ibn Rushd complained in 1196 that Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Politics</em> was not available in al-Andalus, requiring him to
comment on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> as a substitute, around 65
years later it was translated from Greek into Latin by William of
Moerbeke, a Flemish bishop who had lived in the Byzantine empire.
Moerbeke produced two translations of this text. One (the
<em>translatio imperfecta</em>) was made between 1260 and 1264,
includes Book 1 and a considerable section of Book 2, covering from
1252a1 to 1273a30 in Bekker&rsquo;s edition (Flu&#776;eler 1992:
15&ndash;29; Luscombe 1997: 314). Another translation (the
<em>translatio perfecta</em>), probably completed before 1267,
includes all the books of the <em>Politics</em> but in an order
different from the version we have today (Flu&#776;eler 1992:
15&ndash;29). A serious problem for Moerbeke was that the
<em>Politics</em> included many specific and technical words that
applied to the political life of ancient Greece but that were
completely unfamiliar to a medieval audience. Hence, Moerbeke
sometimes just transliterated Greek words into Latin, or in some cases
even left the original Greek words in the Latin translation. These are
among the reasons why one of the chief task of medieval commentators
on the <em>Politics</em> was also to clarify the meanings of words
that were crucial to understanding key conceptual points of
Aristotle&rsquo;s political theory.</p>

<p>
However, in the Latin Middle Ages, Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em>
was usually not part of the official canonical university
<em>curricula</em>. The <em>Politics</em> was mostly read in
extraordinary lectures (<em lang="la">lectiones extraordinariae</em>),
meaning that this text was not included within the compulsory program
that any student had to study in order to receive a degree. At that
time, teaching on the <em>Politics</em> was only possible if
university masters (<em lang="la">magistri</em>) decided to lecture on
it or if the faculty wanted to include it in the university program as
optional. Hence, there were only occasional lectures on the
<em>Politics</em> in Western medieval universities. Apart from these
extraordinary lectures, there is some limited evidence attesting to
the possible presence of this text within teaching <em>curricula</em>,
some of which were ordinary (for example, in Oxford, Cracow, and
Prague; see Luscombe 1997: 214&ndash;215).</p>

<p>
In the Latin Middle Ages, we find a considerable number of
commentaries on the <em>Politics</em>. While limited when compared to
other commentaries on the works of Aristotle, they are still notable
given its sparsity within ordinary university <em>curricula</em>. In a
seminal study, Christophe Flu&#776;eler listed about 30 versions of
commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> in the initial 150
years after the translation of the <em>Politics</em>, more than 50 in
the fifteenth century (Flu&#776;eler 1992: II, 1&ndash;100).
Flu&#776;eler also lists 58 surviving anonymous commentaries and
mentions a list of 49 commentaries that have been recovered in extant
manuscripts, 35 of which can be attributed to particular authors and
the remainder of which remain anonymous (Flu&#776;eler 1992, II,
92&ndash;99). Albert the Great wrote what was probably the first
detailed Latin commentary on all the books of the <em>Politics</em> c.
1265 or a little afterwards (see Flu&#776;eler 1992: 29). Thomas
Aquinas commented on the <em>Politics</em> up to Chapter 26 of Book
III.6), which was later continued by Peter of Auvergne. Whereas Albert
and Aquinas provide relatively detailed literal expositions of
Aristotle&rsquo;s words in an attempt to clarify the ambiguities of
his text, Peter of Auvergne&rsquo;s part tends to interpret the ideas
of Aristotle and sometimes even integrates or adds comments to it (see
Dunbabin 1982: 725&ndash;728). The Aquinas/Peter of Auvergne
commentary was widely influential both in its immediate medieval
context and in the early modern period (Lanza 2013).</p>

<p>
After this first wave of commentaries, we see a second wave that dates
to the end of the thirteenth and through into the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. The commentaries were sometimes literal, such as
those by Guy of Rimini and Nicole Oresme (author of the first known
French vernacular translation of and commentary on the
<em>Politics</em>) and sometimes by <em>quaestiones</em>, in which the
author chose parts of the text that he considered significant and
expounded on them. Among the latter, Peter of Auvergne also authored a
remarkable commentary by <em>quaestiones</em> (Dunbabin 1982:
732&ndash;734) recently edited by Marco Toste (<em>Questiones</em>).
Among others, a commentary known as the Anonymous of Milan provides 90
<em>quaestiones</em> which are quite similar to those of Peter of
Auvergne. Some of these commentaries are particularly original
(meaning that they interact with Aristotle&rsquo;s text to reinforce
specific political ideas of the author himself, as in the case of
Oresme). Others, however, aim to clarify the <em>Politics</em> (for
example, those by Guy of Rimini or Walter Burley; see Dunbabin 1982:
pp 728&ndash;732), even if they often focus on it to address political
transformations taking place in their own contexts.</p>

<p>
Two patterns appear to be relatively common (despite their many
specificities and differences) among all the commentaries on the
<em>Politics</em>: (1) their aim to elucidate the Aristotelian text
and to explain or clarify some parts of it (a task which becomes
particularly pertinent in the <em>quaestiones</em>); (2) their
tendency to read Aristotle&rsquo;s political ideas or examples in
light of the specific institutional and political circumstances in
which the commentaries were written. Starting with the first point,
among the masters who author these commentaries, there is a genuine
theoretical and philosophical interest in many elements of
Aristotle&rsquo;s text. Some theoretical problems present in the
<em>Politics</em> (for example, Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of human
beings as political animals, his theory of the naturalness of
community, his idea of citizenship, and his discussion of natural
slavery) attracted the attention of those medieval authors who tried
to elucidate the meanings of these ideas in light of the opinions of
other authors. These discussions of Aristotle&rsquo;s political ideas
have allowed some contemporary scholars to study the commentary
tradition by focusing on specific themes. For example, Dunbabin and
Syros take the idea of the wisdom and unity of the crowd as their
guiding theme (Dunbabin 1982; Syros 2006), while Juhana Toivanen has
focused on the topic of the political animal (Toivanen 2020) and Toste
and Lidia Lanza concentrate on other specific themes (Lanza 2013;
Toste 2020).</p>

<p>
However, the authors of the <em>Politics</em> commentaries also seek
to understand Aristotle&rsquo;s ideas within the specific political
and institutional contexts of the world in which they lived. Some
studies have stressed that the majority of authors who were Italian or
close to the Italian scene tended to read certain ideas in the
<em>Politics</em> on popular governments in light of the experiences
of the Italian medieval city states (Blythe 1992). Other scholars,
however, claim that the authors who commented on this text, especially
in the northern European context (where royal power was more common
than in Italy), pay more attention to the topics of law and kingship
(Luscombe 1997: 313). This distinction has been criticized since most
theoretical issues within the commentary tradition remain common
regardless of where they were produced and the practical implications
that they might entail (Nederman 1996; Briguglia 2018). Indeed,
attempts to apply Aristotle&rsquo;s political ideas about popular
government, the mixed regime, kingship, law, and the like to definite
institutional and political settings should not lead us to think that
the commentaries had a primarily practical purpose. They were mostly
university texts. This distinguishes them from the many other late
medieval works that put to use Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> for
direct political and ecclesiological purposes.</p>

<h2 id="JameVite">9. James of Viterbo</h2>

<p>
In 1296, the French King Philip IV (the Fair) initiated a struggle
with the papacy regarding his right to tax and exercise control over
the French church and its minions. The controversy had been conducted
through both legal wrangling (such as royal decrees and ecclesiastical
censure) and through polemical quarrels, in which increasingly
extravagant claims were made by both parties and their advocates. The
reigning pope, Boniface VIII, asserted for himself universal lordship
over the entirety of the possessions and offices of the temporal
realm, accruing to him because of his unique status as successor to
Christ through his occupation of the See of St Peter. The proponents
of the cause of the French crown argued in response that the king was
subject to no superior in earthly affairs within his jurisdiction, and
could thus collect revenues from, appoint officials to, and impose
judgment upon the church. After two rounds of engagement, the dispute
was ultimately resolved by the death of Boniface in 1303. A by-product
of the Franco-papal contest was the composition of a series of tracts
by university-affiliated scholars who applied their philosophical
training to defend one or the other cause. Given the erudition
displayed in these texts, they represent one significant facet of
medieval political philosophy, despite the fact that they were written
on behalf of either the papal or the royal contenders (Briguglia
2010). Two especially noteworthy contributors to this literature were
James of Viterbo (c. 1255&ndash;1308) and John (Quidort) of Paris (c.
1245/55&ndash;1306)&mdash;the first a proponent of the papacy, the
other an advocate for the French monarchy.</p>

<p>
The first of these figures, James of Viterbo, argued for the earthly
primacy of papal power in his treatise <em>On Christian Rulership</em>
(<em>De regimine christiano</em>), most likely written in 1302 (Dyson
2018). (Details about his life are presented in the entry on
 <a href="../james-viterbo/">James of Viterbo</a>.)
 He was evidently inspired to write <em>On Christian Rulership</em> by
a pro-papal tract entitled <em>On Ecclesiastical Power</em> (<em>De
potestate ecclesiastica</em>) authored by his fellow Augustinian Giles
of Rome. Whereas Giles relied heavily on neo-Platonic ideas of
metaphysical hierarchy, James drew upon overtly political resources
such as Aristotle and other classical philosophers. <em>On Christian
Rulership</em> is divided into two main sections. The first posits a
careful analogy between the ordering of the Christian church and that
of a kingdom. The second part, of far greater length, focuses of the
character of power within the church as well as the relationship
between spiritual and secular spheres.</p>

<p>
The initial section of James&rsquo;s text owes a substantial debt to
Aristotle directly as well as to the Philosopher&rsquo;s most eminent
medieval interpreter, Thomas Aquinas (Guen&eacute;e 1971 [1985: 40];
Black 1992: 51; Canning 1996: 40, 42). At the beginning of Part 1,
James appeals to the classification of the basic forms of human
association as families, cities, and kingdoms, extrapolating from the
first book of the <em>Politics</em> (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
6&ndash;9). Interestingly, he resists the conclusion that follows from
Aristotle, namely, that man is a political animal. Rather, he posits
that mankind is essentially social in nature, stemming both from the
cooperation entailed by natural necessity and the capacity of speech,
which facilitates advantageous communication, views that are more
typical of Cicero&rsquo;s philosophy than Aristotle&rsquo;s (<em>On
Christian Government</em>: 8&ndash;9, 32&ndash;33). As occurred often
after the recovery of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> and
<em>Politics</em>, mention of those works did not preclude authors
from imposing a Ciceronian interpretation upon Aristotelian doctrines
(Nederman 2020).</p>

<p>
In order to grasp why James found Aristotelian as well as Ciceronian
philosophy congenial to his own purposes in <em>On Christian
Rulership</em>, we must comprehend the background to his overarching
approach to the defense of papalism. On the one hand, James
recurrently proposes parallels between the proper organization of
earthly and spiritual forms of government. In particular, he maintains
that both kings and popes rule over multitudes of persons that
nevertheless collectively constitute communities, whether designated
by the word &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; or &ldquo;church&rdquo; (<em>On
Christian Government</em>: 12&ndash;13&ndash;16&ndash;17). On the
other hand, James wishes to make it unambiguously clear that an
important disanalogy between the two exists inasmuch as royal
authority rests purely upon nature, whereas papal power derives from
grace. &ldquo;The church&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;is not a community of
nature, however, but of grace, &hellip; having been called and brought
together by God through grace&rdquo; (<em>On Christian
Government</em>: 12&ndash;13). One consequence of this bifurcation is
that some aspects of temporal social and political life are entirely
unique to it, while other dimensions resonate with the Church and its
system of government.</p>

<p>
Nature is, as medieval thinkers commonly recognized, ultimately
God&rsquo;s creation. But James consistently treats the human, natural
world according to two standards: one by the direct divine
authorization instantiated by the church, the other by the efforts of
man, reflecting his sociable nature, the maintenance of which
constitutes the reason that government is instituted. He concludes
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
among men, therefore, to whom it is more natural to live in society
than any animal, is there a natural inclination toward the institution
of government; and government of this kind is said to exist by human
law, which arises from nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Government for James thus &ldquo;perfects the inclination of nature;
and so it is called a human and natural power&rdquo; (<em>On Christian
Government</em>: 130&ndash;131). Several elements of this view need to
be highlighted. Consistent with the point discussed above, organized
political life is not natural per se. Rather, earthly government is
authorized in order to preserve the social disposition embedded within
human beings (<em>On Christian Government</em>: 314&ndash;315). It
depends upon the conscious &ldquo;co-operation of natural inclination
and institution; for it was introduced among men by human law, which
arises from nature&rdquo; (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
304&ndash;305). So James envisions the foundation of government to be
human in origination, yet consonant with the natural orientation
inherent in mankind to live socially.</p>

<p>
If men are at their core social beings, however, why would political
rule be needed at all? The answer to this question offered by James is
that every human being possesses reason and intellect, by means of
which he is capable of accessing natural law and acting in accordance
with it: &ldquo;That which is natural is common to all who have a
share in nature&rdquo;, gentiles and Jews no less than Christians
(<em>On Christian Government</em>: 130&ndash;131). However,
men&rsquo;s application of their rational capacities does not occur
evenly. Rather, many (perhaps most) men are frail; they refrain from
employing their reason and are instead overwhelmed by their passions.
James&rsquo;s argument may be broken down as follows: (1) human beings
possess the power of reason, which in principle permits them to live
socially in the absence of government; (2) men are, however, impeded
in the full utilization of their latent rational powers because they
succumb to their self-love and desire for personal (material)
advantage; (3) political authority is brought into existence in order
to support and reinforce the sociability that is intrinsic to mankind
but threatened by the failure to apply reason. On the one hand,
politics is not natural in and of itself. Yet, on the other hand, the
emergence of government is wholly consistent with aspects of human
nature.</p>

<p>
Since James&rsquo;s version of naturalism upholds the principle that
temporal political authority is instituted by men, rather than
conferred directly by God, he arrives at the conclusion that a
ruler&rsquo;s position must be assigned by means of the active assent
of those over whom he exercises power. In his view, &ldquo;Someone
achieves rulership rightly when he is appointed by the agreement and
common consent of the multitude&rdquo; (<em>On Christian
Government</em>: 316&ndash;317). This position runs throughout <em>On
Christian Rulership</em>. When temporal political authority is
conferred upon some person in a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; manner, this
occurs solely as the result of the voluntary determination made by the
human beings who will obey him (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
134&ndash;135, 144&ndash;145). James expressly condemns as
illegitimate the government of anyone &ldquo;who, out of a desire for
mastery, or by force or deceit or by some other unworthy means, usurps
ruling power to himself&rdquo; (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
316&ndash;317). When speaking of royal power in a purely naturalistic
sense, consequently, it is irrelevant to James whether the king is
Christian or pagan (although, of course, the former is preferable to
him).</p>

<p>
The primary role of the king in the promotion of moral virtue and/or
spiritual salvation&mdash;a claim that was a hallmark of many medieval
adherents of Aristotle&mdash;is unequivocally dismissed by James. At
best, he admits that inasmuch as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
external goods serve the virtuous life as instruments, it pertains to
the king to procure and provide for the people a sufficiency of such
goods as are necessary to this life. (<em>On Christian
Government</em>: 150&ndash;151)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As a consequence, <em>On Christian Rulership</em> posits a strict
division between the goals of temporal government and those of the
Church, in such a manner that the most the former can contribute to
the latter is the prevention of physical and material injury and the
preservation of peace as an aide to the clergy&rsquo;s performance of
its holy duties (<em>On Christian Government</em>: 152&ndash;153). For
this very reason, the authorization of the rulership of the
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; social order may and should be left to the
multitude who willingly submits to it.</p>

<p>
In turn, religion forms the bridge between the natural and
supernatural realms, in the sense that belief in God is both inbred in
men and completed by means of grace. Prior to the emergence of the
faiths of the Law and then of the Gospel, James says, practices
associated with religious belief nonetheless were formulated by man
and flourished as a result of indirect divine inspiration, beginning
&ldquo;at the very foundation of the human race&rdquo; (<em>On
Christian Government</em>: 124&ndash;125). Consequently, a priesthood
existed to oversee its rites. James links recognition of divinity to
&ldquo;the virtues that exist according to nature as aptitudes&rdquo;
and in particular to &ldquo;a certain virtue called religion, to which
it pertains to exhibit due worship to God, and which is called a
species of justice&rdquo; (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
126&ndash;127). Because it was derived from the God-given human
disposition to pay tribute to a deity, the pagan form of devotion is
not utterly illegitimate, but merely a partial expression of the
ultimate realization of which is found in Christianity. James
concludes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the priesthood of nature is therefore not destroyed by that of the
gospel, but perfected and formed, because grace does not abolish
nature, but forms and perfects it. (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
128&ndash;129)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As the apex of religion, Christianity is the fulfillment of the
orientation of mankind toward religion, although not now purely by
nature, but by revelation. Yet nature still plays a significant role
in the realization of the Christian faith. For God&rsquo;s direct
disclosure of Himself by means of scripture is granted not to all of
creation, but only to rational beings. Since men alone are endowed
with reason, they and they uniquely enjoy access to divine grace and
the consequent potential for salvation. According to James, the
occurrence of divine forgiveness inheres solely in &ldquo;the kind of
government that belongs to rational creatures, and especially men, who
are properly called rational creatures&rdquo;, namely, &ldquo;the
governing power that has been communicated to the church by Christ or
through Christ&rdquo; (<em>On Christian Government</em>:
114&ndash;115). On these naturalistic philosophical foundations James
thereafter builds his defense of papal primacy, which takes up the
second part of <em>On Christian Rulership</em>.</p>

<h2 id="JohnPari">10. John of Paris</h2>

<p>
The other author of note to contribute a treatise of philosophical
interest to the Franco-papal conflict was John of Paris in his <em>On
Royal and Papal Power</em> (<em>De potestate regia et papali</em>),
evidently written in late 1302 or 1303 in direct response to
James&rsquo;s <em>On Christian Rulership</em> (Ubl 2003). As a member
of the Dominican Order, John probably studied with Thomas Aquinas; he
certainly wrote a defense of Thomistic thought in about 1285, in
response to Franciscan critics. Similar to James of Viterbo,
John&rsquo;s name has been assigned to a wide range of other writings
(approaching two dozen in number) on philosophical and theological
topics. The Dominicans studying and teaching at the University of
Paris had sided overwhelmingly with the royal position in the struggle
between Phillip and Boniface. Indeed, John of Paris&rsquo;s name may
be found among very many other members of his order on a petition
dating to 1303 that urged Philip to bring Boniface to trial before a
general council of the church (Jones 2015: 3&ndash;4).</p>

<p>
<em>On Royal and Papal Power</em> attempts to sort out the complex
differences between distinct types of legal rights attributable to
various institutions and offices depending upon their nature and
condition. The key to John&rsquo;s unraveling of the complexities of
overlapping and competing systems of legal rights is the careful and
strict distinction he draws between jurisdiction
(<em>jurisdictio</em>) and dominion or lordship (<em>dominium</em>).
Jurisdiction refers to &ldquo;the right (<em>ius</em>) of determining
what is just and unjust with respect to &hellip; property rights and
dominion over external goods&rdquo; (<em>RPP</em>: 30). By contrast,
dominion denotes the primary power or capacity to &ldquo;order,
dispose, keep or transfer&rdquo; possessions &ldquo;without injury to
anyone else&rdquo;, what we might call the legal right of ownership
(<em>RPP</em>: 28). <em>On Royal and Papal Power</em> addresses three
central questions arising from this distinction. First, who is lord of
the goods of the church? Second, who enjoys lordship over the property
of laypeople? And third, what is the proper relationship between the
church and the possessions of the laity? In a series of chapters that
comprise the main body of the text, John first offers his own answers
to these questions, then proposes a set of potential objections to his
positions, and finally provides detailed response to supposed
counterarguments.</p>

<p>
According to John, various rights can and must be classified
analytically depending on the types of persons and offices exercising
them. In the case of the goods possessed by the church, he asserts
that &ldquo;no individual person has property rights and dominion over
them&rdquo;; rather, since &ldquo;ecclesiastical goods, as
ecclesiastical, are used for communities and not for individual
persons&rdquo;, ownership of them can only be said to reside in the
community itself (<em>RPP</em>: 22). What, then, is the rightful role
of the pope (or for that matter other spiritual leaders)? In
John&rsquo;s view, the head of any ecclesiastical unit, including the
pope, is a &ldquo;dispenser&rdquo; and &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; of
the property shared by his community, in accordance with the
principles of justice and for the sake of the common good. If the pope
were indeed lord of the goods of the church, he could use them however
he wishes without any reference to the needs of his fellow clerics;
but this would violate the very purpose for which property is donated
to religious organizations. Thus, it must be that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the pope alone is not lord. Rather, he is the general dispenser; and
the bishop or abbot is a special or immediate dispenser, while the
community has true dominion over goods. (<em>RPP</em>: 25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
John goes so far as to declare that the head of an ecclesiastical
community (even the pope), if he appears to be &ldquo;disposing of
goods unfaithfully and for the private and not for the common
good&rdquo;, may rightfully be deposed from office (<em>RPP</em>:
26).</p>

<p>
Neither does the pope enjoy legal rights over the temporal property of
the laity. The earthly goods of non-clerics are rightfully apportioned
by a means other than assignment by clergy. Specifically, John
explains that the external goods of the laity are not granted to the
community, as is ecclesiastical property, but</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
are acquired by individual people through their own art, labor, or
industry, and individual persons, insofar as they are individuals,
have right (<em>ius</em>) and power and true lordship over them.
(<em>RPP</em>: 28; translation modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
John holds that lay lordship over temporalities owes nothing
whatsoever to an interlocking system of property relations created
artificially by a &ldquo;just&rdquo; division of the common. Private
goods enter into some social setting only by an act of volition on the
part of their proprietors, as through acts of exchange or concession.
Consequently, the pope&rsquo;s spiritual rights as head of the church
and ultimate dispenser of its goods do not entitle him to any
jurisdiction over the property of laymen. Christ&rsquo;s
&ldquo;kingship&rdquo; did not extend to temporal affairs and thus
jurisdiction has not been conceded to the pope or any other priest
(<em>RPP</em>: 30&ndash;33).</p>

<p>
Yet what happens in instances when injury to others occurs or when
public needs arise that transcend the capacity of individuals or
groups thereof to redress them? John invokes the concept of the
jurisdiction, which he specifically ascribes to secular rulers to
determine the just and unjust uses of temporal goods. John is very
precise in his construction of his explanation of the connection
between individual property and the authority possessed by earthly
governors. Jurisdiction, he says, is rendered necessary by the entry
of private proprietors into voluntary mutual relations with one
another (<em>RPP</em>: 28&ndash;29). According to John, the temptation
on the part of some to override the rights of others, in conjunction
with the need for individuals to attend the common interest, comprise
the only justifications for the jurisdiction of rulers. Hence, those
who antecedently exercise private property rights must and do
authorize the appointment of a judge and executor over themselves and
their goods. Yet note that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a ruler has the power of judging and ascertaining with respect to the
goods of those under his authority without, however, having dominion
over them &hellip;. (<em>RPP</em>: 30)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The distinction posited between lordship and jurisdiction is clear-cut
and firm. However, in cases of &ldquo;extreme necessity&rdquo;, when
Christians&mdash;lay and clerical alike&mdash;are imperiled by threats
such as &ldquo;an invasion of pagans&rdquo;, John contends that
&ldquo;all the goods of the faithful, even the chalices, belonging to
churches are common and to be shared&hellip;&rdquo; Hence, the ruler
&ldquo;has the power to dispense and determine what is to be turned
over for the common needs of the faith&rdquo; (<em>RPP</em>: 29). In
other words, the imposition of emergency taxes on the church pertains
to the authority of secular government and the pope is duty-bound to
provide aid from the community property under his dispensation.</p>

<h2 id="DantAlig">11. Dante Alighieri</h2>

<p>
Dante Alighieri (1265&ndash;1321 CE) is best known as the author of
the three volumes that comprise the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, a work
that made him one of the most acclaimed writers of Italian literature.
This monumental literary accomplishment&mdash;which does contain some
political content&mdash;ought not to overshadow entirely, however, the
political activism that characterized Dante&rsquo;s life. Especially
toward the end of the thirteenth century (until his exile from
Florence in 1301), he directly participated in Florentine politics and
rose in the political ranks of Florence, even holding the city&rsquo;s
most prestigious magistracy, the priorate. (For more on his career,
see the entry on
 <a href="../dante/">Dante Alighieri</a>.)
 Dante also wrote philosophical and political works, such as <em>De
vulgari eloquentia</em> (<em>On Vernacular Eloquence</em>), the
<em>Convivio</em> (the <em>Banquet</em>) and <em>Monarchia</em>
(<em>Monarchy</em>). Attention to Dante as a philosopher dates back to
the studies of Etienne Gilson and Bruno Nardi in the twentieth century
(Gilson 1948; Nardi 1960), but has once again become an object
considerable of scholarly interest (Aleksander 2011; Brenet 2019;
Marenbon 2001; Tabarroni 2019).</p>

<p>
Despite having received no formal university education, Dante drew on
his philosophical culture to deal with ethical and political problems.
For example, in the <em>Banquet</em>, he provides a classification of
the different branches of human knowledge in which the heavenly
spheres are allegorically identified with the liberal arts. The
practical sciences occupy a privileged position in his scheme. In Book
II.13.8, Dante says that, while in physics and metaphysics can be
found in the eighth heaven, in the ninth sphere (Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>primum mobile</em>), above these disciplines, we should list moral
science (or moral philosophy), just under the divine science,
theology, which is situated in the Empyrean (<em>Convivio</em>:
104&ndash;105 and 116&ndash;118). To clarify this view, in Book II.14,
he claims that moral philosophy &ldquo;sets us in order for the other
sciences&rdquo; (<em>Convivio</em>: 117). Starting with Gilson in the
1930s, scholars have emphasized how this position overturns the
traditional medieval belief that metaphysics is the most important
science within the system of human knowledge (Gilson 1948).
Dante&rsquo;s original vision of the status of moral philosophy may in
turn derive from al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;&rsquo;s classification in
his <em>Enumeration of the Sciences</em>, which by means of its Latin
translation may also be traced to Christian authors such as Roger
Bacon (1220&ndash;1292).</p>

<p>
Dante&rsquo;s most important text of political philosophy is
<em>Monarchy</em>. The discussion over the dates of composition of
this work is ongoing, although scholars generally agree that Dante
must have worked on this treatise after 1312, that is, after the
arrival of German emperor Henry VII in Italy, which ended tragically
with the sudden death of the emperor. The treatise is divided into
three books and aims to provide various philosophical and historical
arguments in support of the autonomy of the temporal power of the
empire. Towards the beginning of <em>Monarchy</em>, Dante presents the
three main questions that guide his analysis over the course of the
three respective books of his treatise. In the first book, Dante
inquires into whether the empire &ldquo;is necessary to the well-being
of the world&rdquo; (<em>Monarchia</em>: 4). The second and third
books are respectively dedicated to the questions &ldquo;Did the Roman
people take on the office of the monarch by right?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Does the monarch&rsquo;s authority derive directly from God or
someone else (his minister or vicar)?&rdquo; (<em>Monarchia</em>:
4).</p>

<p>
Scholars have debated over whether <em>Monarchy</em> should be
considered as a utopian tract or a realist text that relates to the
specific circumstances in which it was composed (Stocchi Perucchio
2017). While a philosophical work, <em>Monarchy</em> also expressed a
politically militancy that aimed to contribute to a lively debate
raging at the beginning of the fourteenth century, which arose from
the challenge posed to the ideal of universal empire by the papal
claim to a plenitude of power. In the first book, Dante explains that
the primary subject of the treatise is political. In his words,
&ldquo;It is clear that the present subject is not directed primarily
towards theoretical understanding but towards action&rdquo;
(<em>Monarchia</em>: 5). Some features of Dante&rsquo;s reasoning are
worth emphasizing. First, Dante&rsquo;s idea of human society
(<em>civilitas</em>) provides a universalist perspective that, as
noted by some scholars (Fioravanti 2019), does not follow the typical
medieval identification between humankind and <em lang="la">Christianitas</em>.
When Dante claims that papal power in
political affairs is not based on the &ldquo;consent of all
men&rdquo;, he mentions the examples of Asians and Africans who are
not Christian and subject to the power of the church
(<em>Monarchia</em>: 89). Second, his universal ideal of the empire is
different from that of his contemporary, Marsilius of Padua, who
believed that the Holy Roman Empire should only be one among many
different political regimes.</p>

<p>
Even if Dante&rsquo;s position on the topic of the empire had
important practical ramifications, it remains fundamentally
philosophical. Grounding a practical and political problem on
philosophical and theoretical assumptions led him to search for the
&ldquo;guiding principle&rdquo; of his inquiry. This first principle
is concerned with the answer to the question, &ldquo;What is the
purpose of human society [<em>societas</em>] as a whole?&rdquo;, and
lies in the idea that the &ldquo;full intellectual potential of
humanity&rdquo; should be continuously actualized (<em>Monarchia</em>:
8). For Dante, a universal temporal monarch and empire alone can
guarantee the full realization of the intellectual potential of
humanity. In <em>Monarchy</em>, Dante combines different sources,
among them Cicero and Aristotle, but also Latin poets such as Virgil
and Lucan. However, Dante finds the roots of his reasoning in support
of the empire in Aristotelian metaphysical principles and
Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical and political thought (for example, he often
stresses the idea that nature does nothing in vain, which also forms
an important premise of his analysis in the <em>Banquet</em>).
Moreover, to defend the key first principle of his reasoning, the idea
that an empire is needed to actualize the potential of humankind
fully, he also directly quotes the philosophy of Ibn Rushd (Averroes),
albeit appropriating it in a very selective and idiosyncratic way.
Dante&rsquo;s mention of Ibn Rushd has sparked a strong debate about
whether he qualifies as an Averroist thinker. In <em>Purgatory</em>
XXV, he explicitly rejected the Averroist idea of the unicity of the
possible intellect. Yet, despite occasional skepticism (Bianchi 2015),
scholars generally concede that in <em>Monarchy</em>, Dante draws
freely on the Averroist idea of the fulfillment of the potential of
human knowledge and places it center-stage (Brenet 2006; Marenbon
2001).</p>

<p>
The bulk of Dante&rsquo;s partisan political theory is contained in
the second and third books of <em>Monarchy</em>, wherein he shows that
(1) the Roman Empire, which is the model par excellence of the
universal empire, deserves to rule the world because it guaranteed
peace and stability; and (2) the legitimacy of that Empire does not
depend on papal power. Dante employs philosophical, scriptural and
historical arguments to support these positions. He also uses two
powerful historical facts to defend his thesis, namely, that the Roman
Empire preceded the church, so that its origins were not historically
dependent on the church, and that the &ldquo;Donation of
Constantine&rdquo; (an eighth-century forgery commonly taken as
authentic at the time) could not validly have assigned the territories
of the empire and authority of the emperor to the papacy. Finally,
behind his rejection of any papal claims to temporal power and his
view that imperial power comes directly from God without any
intermediary at the end of the third book of <em>Monarchy</em>, we
find an important philosophical precept based on the distinction
between earthly and heavenly happiness. Dante argues that, while
happiness in this life is achieved through the &ldquo;teaching of
philosophy&rdquo;, happiness in the afterlife can be achieved through
the study of theology and attaining the vision of God. The two offices
of emperor and pope are entrusted with helping achieve these two
different forms of happiness respectively in the earthly life (by the
emperor) and in the heavenly life (by the pope). Empire is the
necessary condition to render earthly and heavenly happiness possible
because, as a universal authority, it guarantees the peace and quiet
necessary to facilitate felicity. Moreover, God Himself
&ldquo;preordained&rdquo; this relationship between the different
authorities (<em>Monarchia</em>: 93).</p>

<h2 id="MarsPadu">12. Marsilius of Padua</h2>

<p>
Few political philosophers have generated more controversy than
Marsilius (Marsiglio Mainardini) of Padua (c. 1275/80&ndash;c.
1342/43). Reviled by defenders of Christian religious and
institutional orthodoxy during the later Middle Ages,
Marsilius&rsquo;s teachings were nonetheless disseminated even by
those who besmirched his name. In his major work, the <em>Defender of
Peace</em> (<em>Defensor pacis</em>), completed in 1324, Marsilius
upheld a strict separation between the temporal and the spiritual ends
of human existence, and constructed conceptions of the secular
community as well as the church accordingly. (Recent general overviews
of his thought include Merlo 2003; Briguglia 2013; and Ottaviani
2018.) Trained as a physician, probably at Padua&rsquo;s university,
Marsilius eventually moved on to study and teach in Paris, where he
evidently composed the <em>Defender of Peace</em> (Godthardt 2012).
Soon after its completion, Marsilius and his colleague John of Jandun
departed Paris for the court of the German king Ludwig of Bavaria, who
was in the midst of a struggle with Pope John XXII over the
former&rsquo;s claim to the office of emperor. Marsiglio seems to have
orchestrated Ludwig&rsquo;s procession into Italy in 1327 to press his
imperial pretensions&mdash;an exercise that ultimately failed to
achieve its goal (Godthardt 2006).</p>

<p>
At the center of Marsilius&rsquo;s political project is his stalwart
opposition to the earthly pretensions of the priesthood and especially
the papacy. He constructs this argument along several distinct lines,
leading to the organization of the <em>Defender of Peace</em> into
three discourses (<em>dictiones</em>). Discourse I discusses the
origins and nature of earthly political authority; the second
discourse severely criticizes claims made on behalf of the rights of
the church and, particularly, the papacy, to exercise temporal power
and defends an alternate conciliar ecclesiology; a brief third section
summarizes further conclusions that may be derived from the preceding
discourses that Marsilius regards to be especially useful. The
structural division between the substance of Discourse I and of
Discourse II was unusual for its time, inasmuch as it implies a
distinction between the treatment of temporal government and of
ecclesiastical affairs (Koch 2012).</p>

<p>
Yet the <em>Defender of Peace</em> is by no means formed of two
separate, self-subsistent, and internally coherent treatises. Rather,
a single central theme binds together the tract as a whole: the danger
posed to human happiness (as experienced in the peaceful and
self-sufficient community) by the interference of papal government in
secular life. The entire force of the argument in the <em>Defender of
Peace</em> is directed toward demonstrating the disruptive effects of
the papacy&rsquo;s attempts to meddle in temporal affairs (Condren
1980; Nederman 1995: 9&ndash;27). Approached from this perspective,
Discourse I stipulates the arrangements necessary to bolster the
stability and unity of secular communities so as to repulse papal
interference, while Discourse II substitutes the principles of papal
monarchy with those of conciliar ecclesiology.</p>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo;s pursuit of his anti-papal line of political
reasoning depends heavily upon his postulation of a sharp distinction
between temporal and spiritual realms in the <em>Defender of
Peace</em>. In typical Christian Aristotelian fashion, Marsilius
acknowledges that human ends &ldquo;fall into two kinds, of which one
is temporal or earthly, while the other is usually called eternal or
heavenly&rdquo; (<em>Defender of Peace</em>: I.4.3). But the
resemblance between his view and more conventional medieval
Aristotelianism is largely superficial. According to the <em>Defender
of Peace</em>, temporal ends are for the most part indifferent to
spiritual goals. The term &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;, Marsilius says,
&ldquo;refers to every immanent action or passion of human cognitive
or appetitive power&rdquo; (<em>Defender of Peace</em>: II.2.5), where
&ldquo;immanent&rdquo; acts are understood as wholly internal and
self-regarding. Immanent acts are spiritual in the sense that they do
not transgress the boundaries of the soul, hence are invisible to
human observation and are known only to God.</p>

<p>
By contrast, the temporal activities of a human being, Marsilius
believes, are of concern to other people to the extent that they are
&ldquo;transient&rdquo;, that is, have an impact on someone else.
Consequently, &ldquo;transient&rdquo; acts are the proper object of
regulation by the laws and rulers of the political community
(<em>Defender of Peace</em>: I.5.7). When transient behavior is
performed in due proportion, it results in benefits to others as well
as to oneself. When transient action is excessive, however, it
disadvantages other people. Marsilius therefore enshrines temporal
advantage as a fundamental and entirely legitimate goal of human
conduct. Indeed, he establishes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
as the starting-point of everything to be demonstrated&hellip; that
all human beings not deformed or otherwise impeded naturally desire a
sufficient life, and avoid or flee what is harmful thereto&hellip;.
(<em>Defender of Peace</em>: I.4.2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The advantage of human beings is achieved by gaining those conditions
of existence which confer upon them a physically adequate life.
Although Marsilius makes passing mention of the Aristotelian
conception of living well, constituted by the exercise of the
practical and theoretical virtues, the material sufficiency of human
life receives the overwhelming measure of his attention
(Moreno-Ria&ntilde;o &amp; Nederman 2012b).</p>

<p>
Drawing on various sources ranging from Aristotle to Cicero and Ibn
Rushd, Marsilius formulates a philosophical reconstruction of the
origins of human association and of government that serves as an
explanation of both the purpose of civil life and its relation to
human nature. The preservation of individuals is achieved most fully
and naturally under conditions of human cooperation in the context of
an ordered community organized along functional lines, including
farmers, merchants, craftsmen, and warriors among those who count as
citizens. Marsilius holds that &ldquo;human beings came together in
the civil community in order to pursue advantage and a sufficient life
and to avoid the opposite&rdquo; (<em>Defender of Peace</em>: I.12.7).
The pursuit of mutual advantage grounds the account of the origins of
communal life in the <em>Defender of Peace</em>. The
&ldquo;perfected&rdquo; community for Marsilius emerges along with the
differentiation of the functions necessary for a materially sufficient
existence, these tasks being defined by the various arts created by
humankind in order to redress their physical infirmities (<em>Defender
of Peace</em>: I.3.2&ndash;5). Marsilius thus posits that the
commission of &ldquo;transient&rdquo; acts is absolutely necessary for
human beings to attain a sufficient life.</p>

<p>
Marsilius intends the people within the community to take an active
role in their own governance, locating popular consent at the center
of his theoretical framework but also grounding it on an epistemic
theory of popular prudence (Mulieri 2023a; Nederman 1995). Such
consent arises directly from the functional character of the
community. First, in Chapter 11 of the first part of <em>Defender of
Peace</em>, Marsilius presents a theory of collective prudence which
forms the basis of his notion of human law. Second, as he explains in
Chapters 12 and 13, all whose interests are served or effected by a
community must agree to the conditions of association (that is, human
law and rulership). Second, having so consented, all citizens must
individually as well as collectively submit to the terms of their
cooperation, after which they can be held strictly accountable for
excessive &ldquo;transient&rdquo; actions that are detrimental to the
advantage of fellow citizens. In consequence, the <em>Defender of
Peace</em> holds that the legitimacy of both human laws and rulers
depends wholly upon an epistemic defense of the prudence of the people
as well as upon their &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; character, that is, the
extent to which those subject to their jurisdiction have publicly and
overtly consented to their authority (<em>Defender of Peace</em>:
I.9.5, I.12.3). Peace is best upheld when government expresses the
will of the citizen body.</p>

<p>
The second and larger discourse of the <em>Defender of Peace</em>
consists of an examination and critique of papalist theories of
ecclesiastical government, along with the defense of conciliar
ecclesiology. The foundation for much of this theory of the church was
laid already in the first discourse, however. Marsilius stipulated
there that the priesthood must be counted as simply one of the
functions necessary for a perfected community (<em>Defender of
Peace</em>: I.5.10&ndash;14). Therefore, priests are exempt neither
from the secular laws nor from the public burdens required for the
maintenance of civil order. Furthermore, the activities of priests,
just as of other offices within the social body, must be strictly
regulated according to the principles of temporal welfare. In short,
Marsilius denies to the clergy any autonomy in the exercise of their
appointed tasks when these touch upon the realm of
&ldquo;transient&rdquo; action.</p>

<p>
Marsilius&rsquo;s refusal to permit to the priesthood any earthly
independence from the community derives primarily from his conception
of law. Legal prescriptions that have a coercive force, and hence can
be physically imposed upon individuals, are by definition temporal.
The proper function of the priesthood is the education and preparation
of souls for eternal life, a task that is of a wholly spiritual
character. Consequently, the clergy (including the papacy) lacks the
authority to require or prohibit any action of a temporal sort. For
priests to have such legislative power would amount to one part of the
civil body dictating its will to the remaining segments, a situation
the validity of which Marsilius had already discounted in Discourse I.
Marsilius&rsquo;s argument amounts to a denial of the status of
&ldquo;law&rdquo;, which is coercive, to the canons of the Christian
church. Canon law provides at best &ldquo;counsels&rdquo; to the
faithful about deeds they may wish to perform or refrain from for the
sake of their souls.</p>

<p>
The ecclesiology of the <em>Defender of Peace</em> likewise draws upon
the first discourse. Marsilius defines the church as &ldquo;the whole
body of the faithful who believe in and invoke the body of
Christ&rdquo; (<em>Defender of Peace</em>: II.2.3). In his view, the
&ldquo;whole body of the faithful&rdquo; is equivalent to the
&ldquo;perfected community&rdquo; when regarded in its spiritual,
rather than temporal, aspect. Hence, the citizen body forms the
supreme authority in the ecclesiastical realm as well as the secular
sphere. The community alone enjoys the authority to appoint and remove
priests, to legislate regarding spiritual affairs, to punish members
of the faithful, and to impose interdiction and excommunication.
Marsilius hence undermines not merely priestly power, but the entire
edifice of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, with the papacy at its apex.
Neither the pope nor any of the bishops may properly claim for their
office a divine origin or basis; their powers are conferred entirely
by the whole body of the faithful, who always retain the right to
suspend, limit, or eliminate any position or its incumbent. There is
quite literally nothing sacred about the structure of papal
government.</p>

<p>
In order to facilitate control by believers over the church, they
select representatives to meet as a General Council in order to
establish Christian doctrine. The Council appoints and removes
ecclesiastical officials, proclaims and interprets canon law, and
gives final authority to every action undertaken by the institutions
of the church. The Council becomes the effective governing body of the
church, while the pope and other clerical officials serve simply as
executors of the conciliar will. The central goal of the Council is
the canonical interpretation of the divine will as revealed in Holy
Scripture. It is up to the Council, the <em>Defender of Peace</em>
contends, to discover and articulate eternal truths when issues of
doubtful understanding arise and to ensure that the body of the
faithful is guided toward salvation according to holy writ.</p>

<h2 id="WillOckh">13. William of Ockham</h2>

<p>
Although known primarily as one of the most accomplished philosophers
and theologians of the fourteenth century, and in particular as the
most influential early proponent of the metaphysical doctrine of
&ldquo;nominalism&rdquo;, William of Ockham (c. 1285&ndash;1347) also
composed a substantial body of political writings. (A full exposition
of his life and philosophy may be found in the entry on
 <a href="../ockham/">William of Ockham</a>.)
 From 1328 onward, Ockham devoted his career to the twin pursuits of
defending the Franciscan ideal of apostolic poverty and advancing the
imperial claims of German king Ludwig of Bavaria, composing a series
of stinging attacks on the papacy&rsquo;s heretical condemnation of
the doctrines espoused by Franciscans, while also producing an
impressive body of writings on secular government and ecclesiology,
(see McGrade 1974; Shogimen 2007).</p>

<p>
Like his contemporary Marsilius of Padua, Ockham places a premium on
populism and consent in both temporal government and the church. But
the resemblance stops there, since Ockham&rsquo;s arguments are
grounded on a set of principles wholly different from
Marsilius&rsquo;s. At the core of Ockham&rsquo;s political philosophy
is a commitment to a doctrine of so-called &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;
interpretation of natural rights that gestures toward more modern
versions of the doctrine, rather than to the traditional idea that
rights are &ldquo;objective&rdquo;, in the sense that they entail
duties to act or refrain from acting rooted in a universal law of
nature that binds all people. There has been considerable dispute
about whether Ockham was the inventor of natural rights theory or
simply an expositor of a position the foundations of which existed
earlier in the Middle Ages (Villey 1975; Tuck 1979; Tierney 1997;
Robinson 2013). One point is clear, however. He drew conclusions from
his conception of rights that were overtly political&mdash;pertaining
to both temporal and ecclesiastical systems of government&mdash;rather
than theological or moral in bearing.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the clearest example of Ockham&rsquo;s accomplishment may be
found in <em>A Short Treatise on Tyrannical Government</em>
(<em>Breviloquium de principatu tyrannico</em>) The tract has two main
purposes: first, to undermine papal claims to a plenitude of power;
second, to establish that secular rulers (especially, but not
exclusively, the Roman emperor) possess their offices independently of
any authorization or appointment by the clergy, the pope most of all.
Both of these positions can be traced to a conception of divinely
ordained natural rights implicit in a phrase that Ockham employs time
and again throughout the <em>Short Treatise on Tyrannical
Government</em>: &ldquo;The rights and liberties given by God and
nature&rdquo; (<em>Breviloquium</em>: 54, 62, 124, 133). That he has
in mind a subjective conception of human rights is reinforced by his
express condemnation of &ldquo;those who, not content with their own
rights, &hellip; reach out for others&rsquo; rights, divine as well as
human&rdquo; (<em>Breviloquium</em>: 3). Ockham&rsquo;s repeated
association of &ldquo;rights&rdquo; with &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; is
striking. Both unquestionably emanate from God but at the same time
are sanctioned by nature. The unmistakable implication is that <em>ius
naturale</em> is characterized (at least some of the time) by a realm
of personal autonomy protected from interference by others, especially
the pope, short of valid cause. In other words, while rights are not
unlimited&mdash;one is not at liberty, for example, to usurp the
legitimately held position of a king or emperor&mdash;they are in the
first instance one&rsquo;s own possession.</p>

<p>
Ockham&rsquo;s position informs the terms of his political philosophy
reflected in <em>A Short Treatise on Tyrannical Government</em>. Who
governs depends upon the &ldquo;rights and liberties conferred by God
and nature&rdquo;. Ockham contends that rightful authority, even
before the birth of Christ, might be founded on human endorsement
alone, with the permission of God, of course (<em>Breviloquium</em>:
113&ndash;114). An instance of the latter, Ockham says, is when
imperial <em>potestas</em> is assigned &ldquo;through men voluntarily
subjecting themselves to an emperor and giving him jurisdiction and
power over themselves&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;established by human
ordinance&rdquo; (<em>Breviloquium</em>: 117). He ascribes the
capacity of human beings to achieve this result to the fact that
&ldquo;from God and nature all mortals born free and not subject to
anyone else by human law have the power voluntarily to set a ruler
over themselves&rdquo; (<em>Breviloquium</em>: 117). In other words,
the inherent volition stemming from the subjective rights natural to
men permits (indeed, requires) their consent to the terms of their own
governance. The free approval of subjects ensures that governments,
whether in pagan times or after the advent of Christianity, accord
with the natural rights bestowed by God. Ockham provides, then, a
human rights justification of consent to government.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Dialogue</em> (<em>Dialogus</em>), a lengthy exchange
between a Master and a Student, Ockham once again addresses how
imperial jurisdiction originated. He begins the argument by drawing a
firm distinction between the foundation of the universal jurisdiction
of the papal office and that ascribed to the emperor. The Master
renounces the position that the authority of each derives from the
same source, asserting instead that they are disanalogous in this
respect. The pope (&ldquo;the president in spiritual matters&rdquo;)
is ordained directly by God. The emperor of the world (&ldquo;the
president of temporalia&rdquo;), on the other hand, is granted power
by neither divine nor natural law, but rather by human assent. Ockham
explains that, as a consequence, those matters that pertain purely to
the determinations of mankind, rather than God or nature, &ldquo;can
licitly be changed by men, because everything is dissolved by the same
causes that gave it birth&rdquo; (Ockham <em>Dialogus-III</em>: 256).
He supports this claim by remarking that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
before one secular ruler presided over all mortals, those who wished,
for a just and reasonable cause, could licitly consent that someone
should not be appointed to empire over the whole world; for when there
is a loss to the liberty or power or right of some, the consent of all
must be sought and had. (<em>Dialogus-III</em>: 256)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Prior to the authorization of the emperor, human beings enjoy complete
freedom that is their personal attribute as natural possession.</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in the <em>Dialogue</em>, Ockham discusses the issue of who
enjoys the right to select the pope. In his view, since the bishop of
Rome (who happens to be the pope) should be chosen by the people over
whom he exercises his clerical authority, the determination of the
papal incumbent must properly be in the hands of the Romans.
&ldquo;The Romans have the right to elect the highest pontiff&rdquo;,
Ockham says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Those whom he is to be set over have the right to elect the one to be
set over them, so that no one should be given to them against their
will. (Ockham <em>Dialogus-III</em>: 290)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On principle, &ldquo;no one should be set over the whole body of
mortals&rdquo;&mdash;by which he means the Roman people in their
special role as the representatives of humanity&mdash;&ldquo;except by
their election and consent&rdquo; (<em>Dialogus-III</em>:
290&ndash;291). In their original condition, the Roman people
determined their own bishop (who happens to be the pope). Yet, in
turn, the Romans &ldquo;transferred their power to the emperor&rdquo;
such that &ldquo;the Romans themselves can resign their right and also
transfer to another the right to elect the highest pontiff&rdquo;
(<em>Dialogus-III</em>: 291). On this account, the conferral of papal
authority belongs originally to the Roman people. But the same
principle allows the Romans to assign this right to the emperor, who
makes the decision on their behalf. Broadly speaking, the emperor
represents the people who have granted power to him, but he then
decides on the identity of the pope without direct reference to the
Romans, standing in for them.</p>

<p>
Yet when it comes to examining and punishing a pope who has fallen
into heresy, the emperor enjoys no special authority. Ockham refers
the matter to a General Council of the church as the ultimate source
of authority within Christendom. Ockham poses the question of who may
legitimately convoke such a Council. He proclaims the somewhat
startling proposition that not only &ldquo;kings and princes&rdquo;,
but &ldquo;even the laity can, if they will it, convene a General
Council, and participate in the deliberations of this council&rdquo;
(Ockham <em>Dialogus-I</em>: 7). After adducing several authoritative
sources to support this assertion, he asserts that, since &ldquo;the
deliberations of a general council touch all, because the
deliberations ought to be about the faith, and everything that
pertains to all Christians&rdquo;, it &ldquo;is understood that all
can deliberate&rdquo; (<em>Dialogus-I</em>: 9). Not only the clergy,
but also the laity, possess the competence to engage in the activity
of the Council, since it refers to matters shared by all&mdash;lay
people as well as religious (<em>Dialogus-I</em>: 11). Thus, any
faithful Christian is qualified to assemble a council, rather than
just secular magnates. Indeed, Ockham takes this claim to a seeming
extreme: lay women just as much as lay men may convoke a General
Council, inasmuch as matters of the faith also touch them. Thus,
&ldquo;of necessity, women are not to be excluded from a General
Council&rdquo;, in either its calling or its deliberations
(<em>Dialogus-I</em>: 12). One may again detect echoes of the emphasis
on consent that runs throughout Ockham&rsquo;s political writings.</p>

<h2 id="NicoOres">14. Nicole Oresme</h2>

<p>
During the Middle Ages, many philosophers were also deeply engaged
with public affairs, especially in the service of royal courts. Thus,
the career of Nicole Oresme (c. 1320&ndash;1382) was hardly unusual.
While he possessed excellent academic credentials, studying and
teaching in the Arts faculty at the University of Paris, Oresme was
also closely associated with the court of French king Charles V, who
had achieved notoriety as a patron of literary and philosophical
pursuits. Oresme moved seamlessly between the university, the secular
court, and the church (at his death he was Bishop of Lisieux).
Oresme&rsquo;s own contributions to philosophy included a wide range
of investigations, typical of scholastic philosophers, into
metaphysics, cosmology, and mathematics, as well as ethics, economics
and politics. Especially worthy of attention is his tract on the
nature and importance of money and his French vernacular translations
of and commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>
and <em>Politics</em> (and also the pseudo-Aristotle
<em>Economics</em>), all of which fused philosophy with the world of
the court. (For a more complete account of his life and teachings, see
the entry on
 <a href="../nicole-oresme/">Nicole Oresme</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Oresme&rsquo;s <em>Treatise on the Origin, Nature, Law and Mutation of
Money</em> (<em>Tractatus de origine et natura, jure et mutationibus
monetarum</em>), better known as <em>On Money</em> (<em>De
moneta</em>), counts among the earliest medieval tracts to concentrate
explicitly on a specific economic topic (see Kaye 1998; Nederman 2009:
235&ndash;247; Woodhouse 2017; Giglio 2022). He probably wrote this
treatise in the context of an ongoing debate concerning the debasement
of the French coinage, a procedure from which the crown had profited
for many years. <em>On Money</em> makes a powerful case favoring the
stabilization of the value of money over the royal temptation to raise
revenue through reminting or coin clipping. Oresme says that the work
has two purposes: to identify the underlying political nature of the
problem of currency manipulation, and to advise his countrymen in a
pragmatic fashion about a matter of public policy. His specialized
economic analysis is prefatory to his effort to bring economic
concerns to bear on the duties of rulers and the needs of their
subjects.</p>

<p>
Central to this project is Oresme&rsquo;s contention that money
&ldquo;is well-suited for intercourse among a large number of human
beings and the use of it is good in itself&rdquo; (Oresme <em>De
moneta</em>: 5). Economic enterprise makes key contributions to the
public welfare, which is the intended purpose of exchange relations.
Since trade and commerce directly impact the common good, he insists
that the enabling medium of money must be the property of the
community. Although the ruler is assigned responsibility for the
actual minting and regulating of the money supply, he does so as an
executive agent of the community, deputized to realize the public good
of sound currency and equitable exchange. The dominant theme of
Oresme&rsquo;s treatise is the communal ownership, and thus ultimate
control, of money. From this precept follows the advice of <em>On
Money</em> about the debasement of coinage as a political phenomenon.
Since the community requires money in order to engage in a full range
of economic activities, and hence to promote the good of its members,
the very idea that a ruler exerts private control over coinage is
excluded.</p>

<p>
Implicit in the ascription of money&rsquo;s ownership to the community
is an economic conception of the common good itself. Oresme employs
the traditional distinction between &ldquo;true kingship&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tyranny&rdquo; in explicating the difference between
well-ordered and evil government (Oresme <em>De moneta</em>: 42).
Unlike his predecessors, however, Oresme&rsquo;s examples of just and
unjust rule are invariably couched in terms of the economic impact of
a government&rsquo;s actions. In explaining why manipulation of the
value of currency by a ruler is unjust, he draws an analogy to
political interference in agricultural markets (<em>De moneta</em>:
16). The value of the goods within a community can only be established
in the first instance by voluntary exchanges among individuals.
Tyranny occurs when legitimate economic choices are countermanded for
the self-interest of those who hold political power. By contrast, good
government or kingship has a decidedly economic overtone.
Consequently, royal judgments about public policy ought to rest on
determinations about the economic welfare of the community.</p>

<p>
Oresme&rsquo;s other major contribution to political philosophy, his
French-language translation of and commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Politics</em>, advances many of the themes articulated in <em>On
Money</em>. Commissioned by Charles V sometime in the 1370s, this
commentary (and its companions on the <em>Ethics</em> and
<em>Economics</em>) represented an early effort to make available to a
non-Latinate readership ideas otherwise accessible only in the lecture
rooms of the universities (Babbit 1985; Sherman 1995). Unlike other
commentators, however, Oresme often moved well beyond the text of the
<em>Politics</em> and developed Aristotelian themes creatively and in
a manner more directly germane to his courtly audience. He also showed
no reluctance to criticize Aristotle when it seemed appropriate to
him. Oresme thus demonstrated an eclectic spirit that liberates his
commentary from many of the constraints imposed by the scholastic
pedagogical origins of his predecessors.</p>

<p>
One example of this independent cast of mind is Oresme&rsquo;s
dissatisfaction with Aristotle&rsquo;s classification of
constitutions. He mentions the basic Aristotelian six-fold division
and, given the context of his audience, upholds kingship as the best
system of government (Oresme <em>Politiques</em>: 87c). But Oresme
then proposes a different way of categorizing constitutions, inasmuch
as he speaks of kingship, tyranny, and faction&mdash;the latter, as
Oresme understands it, being identical to oligarchy. Oresme
additionally proffers the claim, not to be found in the
<em>Politics</em>, that democracy is form of a tyranny. Oresme
postulates that the distinction between good and defective regimes
depends upon the absence in the latter of a <em lang="fr">chose
publique</em>, that is, &ldquo;public affairs&rdquo; necessary for a
well-ordered community. Oresme stresses that &ldquo;the <em>chose
publique</em>&rdquo; in such bad regimes &ldquo;is not vicious
&hellip; but is simply and entirely non-existent&rdquo;
(<em>Politiques</em>: 88b). Thus, imperfect regimes lack a core or a
unity&mdash;an agreement among their members about the common good, to
express the matter in Aristotelian terms. Yet Oresme also acknowledges
that, bad though they may be, &ldquo;nevertheless these polities do
exist&rdquo; (<em>Politiques</em>: 88b). Democracies and
oligarchies&mdash;like tyrannies&mdash;are not merely theoretical
systems but have real-world corollaries.</p>

<p>
Oresme extends the understanding of imperfect regimes when he takes up
the question of their operative principles of distributive justice,
especially in the case of oligarchic and democratic systems. Aristotle
maintained that citizens in both of these constitutions profoundly
misconceive the nature of political justice, and thus that neither of
their governmental structures qualified as just. Oresme adopts a more
conciliatory line. &ldquo;In all constitutions, whether they be good
or bad&rdquo;, he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
they must agree that there is a certain right (<em lang="fr">droit</em>)
and ordinances or positive laws that approximate
justice in some degree, for otherwise there could not be legal actions
or entry into interrelations. (Oresme <em>Politiques</em>: 89b)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Oresme, justice so predominates in human nature that even
the iniquitous partake of some small portion of it
(<em>Politiques</em>: 89b-c). Oresme concludes that &ldquo;there are
many just laws that are common to both [perfect and imperfect] sorts
of constitution&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;commutative justice in
contracts and in punishment and in other like matters&rdquo;
(<em>Politiques</em>: 90b). Once again, he seems prepared to
accommodate defective systems to a far greater extent than Aristotle.
Justice is not an all-or-nothing proposition in political communities.
Hence, the line between perfect and imperfect regimes begins to
blur.</p>

<p>
Likewise, in an excursus about the relationship between contemplative
and active <em>eudaimonia</em>, Oresme recasts Aristotle&rsquo;s
well-known predilection for philosophical contemplation over action
(as expressed in Book 10 of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and
elsewhere). After extensive discussion of which form of existence is
most fulfilling, he concludes that contemplation must be set aside
when action is required for the maintenance of social and political
bonds (<em>Politiques</em>: 243a). Oresme asserts that &ldquo;a
mixture of contemplative work and active work is more desirable and
better than one that is entirely taken up with contemplation&rdquo;
(<em>Politiques</em>: 243d), which in turn permits him to praise the
life of the prince (presumably someone like Charles V) as the best
possible one on earth (<em>Politiques</em>: 244c).</p>

<h2 id="IbnKhal">15. Ibn Khald&#363;n</h2>

<p>
Some scholars consider Ibn Khald&#363;n (1332&ndash;1406) to be the
first and greatest political philosopher of the medieval Islamic world
because he separates the study of history and politics from purely
moral considerations (Abb&egrave;s 2022; Gutas 2004). Ibn Khald&#363;n
was born in Tunis and enjoyed a very adventurous life. This led him to
work as an advisor to several important Muslim rulers of his time, and
he also interacted with the famed conqueror and king Timur
(Tamerlane), to whom he gave advice and who may have inspired some of
his political ideas (Black 2011: 170). However, he underwent periods
of self-imposed exile which he used to study history and politics, as
well as to write his works. In this sense, Khald&#363;n is the perfect
example of a theorist who constantly drew on practice to define his
political philosophy. Above all, he is the author of a <em>Universal
History</em> (<em>Kitab al-&lsquo;lbar</em>), which includes an
initial section known as the <em>Prolegomena</em>
(<em>Muqaddimah</em>), on which he worked throughout his life.</p>

<p>
Ibn Khald&#363;n was trained in classical Islamic philosophy (reading
Al-F&#257;r&#257;b&#299;, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Rushd) and, at an early
age, defined metaphysics as the noblest science (Mahdi 1957). However,
in a later phase, the relationship between his political philosophy
and metaphysics (which, like other Islamic philosophers, he also sees
embodied in Aristotle&rsquo;s thought) became more complex. On the one
hand, Ibn Khald&#363;n still drew inspiration from some important
aspects of Aristotelian political philosophy, such as the idea that
human beings are political animals. (However, it is uncertain whether
he ever read or had access to Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> and
he might have derived these ideas from other sources). On the other
hand, he became increasingly critical of philosophy&rsquo;s
traditional methods for studying the domain of politics. For example,
in assessing the relevance of Aristotle&rsquo;s ideas for the
treatment of royal power, he claimed that they are not
&ldquo;exhaustive&rdquo; (<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 96&ndash;97) and
increasingly shifted his attention from pure philosophy and
metaphysics to history. This is only one dimension of a more general
criticism that Khald&#363;n addresses to the Islamic <em>falasifa</em>
(whom he still admired very much) when he speaks about the
&ldquo;ideal virtuous state&rdquo; of the philosophers as something
that hardly exists and that they tend to discuss hypothetically
because it is &ldquo;rare&rdquo; and &ldquo;remote&rdquo; (Black 2011:
175; Namazi 2022: 163). In the <em>Muqaddimah</em>, Khald&#363;n
defines history as a discipline that &ldquo;involves
speculation&rdquo;, &ldquo;a subtle explanation of the causes and
origins of existing things&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;deep knowledge
of the how and why of the events&rdquo;. For this reason, he argues
that history &ldquo;is firmly rooted in philosophy&rdquo; and
&ldquo;deserves to be accounted a branch of it&rdquo;
(<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 50). According to Khald&#363;n, the function of
history is also to distinguish the true from the false, by providing
detailed and reasoned accounts of the unfolding of historical
events.</p>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s political philosophy focused on the city-state
(<em>polis</em>), while Ibn Khald&#363;n places the concept of
civilization (<em>umran</em>) at the center of his political thought
(Black 2011). In a certain sense, Ibn Khald&#363;n came to base his
specific definition of history on precisely this notion of
civilization. In fact, he says that &ldquo;history, in matter of fact,
is information about human social organization, which itself is
identical with world civilization&rdquo; (<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 89).
Therefore, the study of the notion of civilization and the complex
relationships between different human groups (and how they achieve
&ldquo;superiority over another&rdquo;), their rise and decline lay at
the heart of his thinking (<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 89). This attention to
the notion of civilization is also essential because it helps to
achieve what Khald&#363;n defines as the main aim of a
historical-political investigation, that is, to analyze critically the
facts in order to distinguish &ldquo;truth from falsehood&rdquo;
(<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 92&ndash;93, 147).</p>

<p>
Ibn Khald&#363;n&rsquo;s description of civilization takes into
account the material components which are necessary to sustain
material life (e.g., climate and the modes of production) and is based
on two main different concepts that are also &ldquo;two driving forces
in human history in every civilization&rdquo; (Black 2011: 173):
<em>asabiyya</em> (a term that could be translated as &ldquo;group
feeling&rdquo;) and <em>mulk</em> (often translated as &ldquo;state
power&rdquo;). For Khald&#363;n, <em>asabiyya</em> refers to the
&ldquo;ability to defend oneself, to offer opposition, to protect
oneself and to press one&rsquo;s claims. Whoever loses it is too weak
to do any of these things&rdquo; (<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 190). However,
this same principle establishes the superiority of some groups of
people over others and is therefore essential to having good
governance and a stable, peaceful community.</p>

<p>
At the same time, Khald&#363;n states that once mankind has achieved a
form of social organization that establishes civilization, a natural
need arises to exert a &ldquo;restraining influence to keep people
apart because of their natural aggressiveness and injustice&rdquo;
(<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 104&ndash;105). This leads people to appoint a
person to exercise &ldquo;restraining influence&rdquo; in the form of
royal authority to keep people&rsquo;s aggressiveness in check. This
characterization of Khald&#363;n&rsquo;s theory of kingly power
suggests that such authority does not depend on blood or dynastic
power but on the dynamics of feeling and group membership. However, it
is also important to note that the very development of <em>mulk</em>
creates the conditions for the decline of civilization, because one
man&rsquo;s power is more likely to degenerate into its selfish and
self-centered use which harms society as a whole. The relationship
between these two driving forces of human civilization has led some
scholars to debate the actual credentials of Khald&#363;n&rsquo;s
political commitment, with some seeing a form of republicanism in
elements of his ideas (Black 2011: 175).</p>

<p>
Within these general considerations on the rise and decline of
civilization, Khald&#363;n also leaves room for specific concerns
based on the material and economic conditions that contribute to the
stability of a society. In the <em>Muqaddimah</em>, Khald&#363;n
explains that the creation and development of property is a crucial
factor in explaining the rise, health, and decline of civilization. In
his view, civilization falls into disrepair when royal power is no
longer able to protect property (<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 201). Given the
central role that Khald&#363;n ascribes to cultural activity in
maintaining civilization, creating incentives for this type of
activity is critical. This is also achieved by lowering taxes on
people who engage in cultural enterprises in order to stimulate
creativity and to increase the possibility of the ruler receiving
revenue from these activities (<em>Muqaddimah</em>: 357). In other
words, anticipating some themes of modern political economy,
Khald&#363;n maintains that low taxation is key to promoting the
public wealth.</p>

<h2 id="ChriDePiza">16. Christine de Pizan</h2>

<p>
Considered to be the earliest woman of letters of France, Christine de
Pizan (c. 1365&ndash;c.1430) was born in Venice, daughter of a
physician and astrologer, whose training led him to an appointment to
the court of King Charles V of France. Christine&rsquo;s love of
learning and familiarity with court life brought their reward after
her husband succumbed when she was only twenty-five years of age,
leaving her with three young children, a widowed mother, and an
orphaned niece to support (Willard 1984). Christine turned to a life
of letters both for consolation and for income, writing a series of
remarkable works that included poetry, biography, politics, chivalry,
warfare, religion, and philosophy. She is probably best known today
for two books written to defend and instruct women: <em>The Book of
the City of Ladies</em> (<em>Le Livre de la Cit&eacute; des
Dames</em>) and <em>The Book of the Three Virtues</em> (<em>Le Livre
des Trois Vertus</em>). In addition, Christine composed a work
addressed to the fourteen-year-old heir to the French throne, Louis of
Guyenne. This treatise, <em>The Book of the Body Politic</em> (<em>Le
Livre de Corps de Policie</em>), is in many ways an example of the
&ldquo;mirror for princes [<em lang="la">specula
principum</em>]&rdquo; genre, whose purpose was to edify as well as
entertain rulers, with the goal of transforming them into model kings
(Forhan 2002: 27&ndash;44). Writing from the self-identified
perspective of a non-noble &eacute;migr&eacute; widow who had become
learned in French-language as well as (probably) Latin texts, she
demonstrates considerable acquaintance with ancient and medieval
philosophical sources and traditions.</p>

<p>
Her writings display, in particular, both sensitivity to the financial
pressures facing Europe&rsquo;s monarchic governments and deep concern
for the needs of the larger populace, including women, city-dwellers,
and the poor. The fulcrum on which she balanced these potentially
competing interests is her insistence on an inescapably reciprocal
relationship between the French people and the royal regime. Her main
contribution to political philosophy, the <em>Book of the Body
Politic</em>, takes its organizing theme from Books 5 and 6 of John of
Salisbury&rsquo;s <em>Policraticus</em>. It is arranged in three
parts. Part I considers in detail the education of the prince,
including how he should eat and dress as well as the ideas and
writings to which he should be exposed. The second section treats the
conduct expected of knights and nobles. Finally, Part III examines the
lives of commoners, specifically, merchants, clergy, and students as
well as artisans and peasants. As is appropriate for a work directed
to a royal audience, <em>The Book of the Body Politic</em> conveys a
message of princely responsibility. But it also contains an implicit
warning: if a ruler&mdash;in this case, the future King
Louis&mdash;does not act in a manner consonant with his duties, his
subjects may cease to obey him and perhaps even revolt.</p>

<p>
As the title of the book suggests, Christine approached the social
complexity that characterized the late medieval landscape by
appropriating and adapting the organic metaphor. Like some of her
predecessors, Christine&rsquo;s body politic incorporated an
inclusive, reciprocal, and interdependent conception of community. She
observes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
just as the human body is not whole, but defective and deformed, when
it lacks any of its members, so the body politic cannot be perfect,
whole, or healthy if all the estates of which we speak are not well
joined and united together. (<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 90)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Christine, communal order ensues when the health of the entire
public unit is preserved through the mutual coordination of the tasks
necessary for its existence (<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 91). To
despise any of the members, or to reduce any to a state of servitude,
constitutes an attack on the well-being of the whole. Christine also
extends medieval precedents by imputing to the body politic a
noticeably secular orientation. Unlike her source, John of
Salisbury&rsquo;s <em>Policraticus</em>, the clergy in
Christine&rsquo;s model are not the body&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul&rdquo;,
but simply one of the three branches of the common people (<em>Corps
de Policie</em>: 19, 95&ndash;99). Consequently, Christine expects the
king, when necessary, to correct an errant &ldquo;prelate, priest, or
cleric&rdquo; (<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 14). Because Christine
conceives of the king as ordainer and regulator of <em>all</em>
estates within the realm, the church does not exercise supremacy over
the temporal sphere.</p>

<p>
The overtly secular bearing of Christine&rsquo;s body politic informs
her discussion of how the king ought to rule. Christine&rsquo;s
insistence on the importance of the moral well-being as well as
material improvement of all members motivates her mandate that the
ruler must orient his policies in order to &ldquo;increase and
multiply the virtue, strength, power, and wealth of his country&rdquo;
(<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 39). The promotion of public piety is not
primary among his duties, although she certainly maintains that
&ldquo;the good prince ought to forbid&rdquo; those forms of conduct
&ldquo;opposed to and disapproved by the Christian religion and could
be the cause of the wrath of God and the subversion of kingdoms and
countries where they take place&rdquo; (<em>Corps de Policie</em>:
14). Note here Christine&rsquo;s overtly practical advice for why
rulers should adhere to the tenets of Christianity: impiety endangers
the security of their position. Moreover, her explicit inclusion of an
economic dimension among a government&rsquo;s central aims deserves
special attention. Certainly, it helps to explain her detailed
analysis of the lives of merchants, artisans, and laborers, as well as
their relations with the king. Not only does Christine argue that men
of commerce are not to be disdained; she insists that without</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the merchant class &hellip; neither the estate of kings and princes
nor even the polities of cities and countries could exist. &hellip; By
the[ir] industry &hellip; all kinds of people are provided for without
having to make everything themselves. (<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 103,
104)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A nation can only reap the rewards of increased labor efficiencies
when there is &ldquo;trade and an abundance of merchants&rdquo;
(<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 104). In an archetypical example of
organic reciprocity, Christine holds that all classes benefit when
commercial society is encouraged to flourish.</p>

<p>
Christine likewise praises craftsmen and peasants, without whose labor
&ldquo;the republic &hellip; could not sustain itself&rdquo;
(<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 105). Because the goods produced and
activities performed by such workers are necessary to meet quotidian
human needs, their contribution must be accorded value. While
judgments may be made about how well individuals perform in their
diverse offices, no office which contributes to the community&rsquo;s
material welfare may be demeaned or disdained. The prince, therefore,
must maintain and enhance the economic condition of the realm, oversee
the efficient coordination of all necessary tasks, and protect against
financial force and fraud. These central duties entail that the ruler
first be familiar with the myriad activities necessary to the realm
and &ldquo;ought to hear sometimes about the common people, laborers,
and merchants, how they make their profit &hellip;&rdquo; (<em>Corps
de Policie</em>: 10). Thus will the prince, fully appreciating the
contributions of the lower orders, govern knowledgeably and
competently.</p>

<p>
Most importantly, the king must understand how his own policies impact
the conditions of his realm. Poorly compensated soldiers, Christine
explains, &ldquo;pillage and despoil the country&rdquo;, exacerbating
the economic hardships of the rural poor, whereas well-paid troops
bolster the rural economy by purchasing &ldquo;everything that they
needed economically and plentifully&rdquo; (<em>Corps de Policie</em>:
17). Similarly, royal taxation policies ought to be
&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, to affect rich and poor equitably, and to
not &ldquo;gnaw &hellip; poor commoners &hellip; to the bone&rdquo;
(<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 10). Christine&rsquo;s conclusion that
wise &ldquo;princes would rather be poor in a rich country, than to be
rich and have plenty in a poor country&rdquo; is a piece of practical
advice that naturally follows from an organic conception of communal
interdependence (<em>Corps de Policie</em>: 22).</p>

<p>
Supplementing Christine&rsquo;s reflections on the unity of
socio-political order are her books about women&rsquo;s contributions,
the <em>City of Ladies</em> and the <em>Three Virtues</em>. Her
distinctive conception of society provides the justification for
women&rsquo;s visibility in Christine&rsquo;s vision of the body
politic. In her telling, Ceres and Isis &ldquo;taught [the people] to
build cities and towns&rdquo;, within which women developed most of
the arts and civilized forms of labor, including weaving, olive oil
extraction, cart construction, metal working, cultivation, toolmaking,
and gardening (<em>Cit&eacute; des Dames</em>: 73&ndash;76). Without
women&rsquo;s innovations and contributions, Christine asserts,
humanity would have remained in a &ldquo;bestial&rdquo; state. Those
who believe that mankind would be better off in this primitive
condition blaspheme against the divinely conferred skills and
abilities that Ceres and Isis first discovered.</p>

<p>
Moreover, women of all estates, Christine maintains, have the
capabilities necessary (perhaps even uniquely) to contribute to the
tasks associated with the maintenance of earthly well-being. While
Christine surely knew Aristotle&rsquo;s argument, a mainstay of
medieval political literature, for the exclusion of women from public
life, she challenged this claim directly, envisioning, for example,
the princess as a sort of ombudsperson (<em>Trois Vertus</em>:
84&ndash;87). Construed in organic terms, the princess furthers bodily
intercommunication by serving as a mediating force between king and
populace (<em>Trois Vertus</em>: 85). Toward this end, she must
occasionally meet with burghers, merchants, and artisans in order to
facilitate &ldquo;love and good will&rdquo;, thereby strengthening
public order and unity. Christine also recognizes that women of the
commercial and laboring classes face special burdens. She warns
merchants&rsquo; wives, for example, to &ldquo;avoid
ostentation&rdquo; in dress, as such conspicuous display &ldquo;can
cause new taxes for their husbands&rdquo; (<em>Trois Vertus</em>: 6).
Christine&rsquo;s close attention to the complex intersections of
gender and social class manifests in pragmatic counsel to women of
various stations, aimed at sustaining a harmonious and cooperative
