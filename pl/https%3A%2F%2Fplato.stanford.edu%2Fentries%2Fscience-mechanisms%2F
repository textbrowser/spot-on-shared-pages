<h1>Mechanisms in Science</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Nov 18, 2015; substantive revision Thu Aug 1, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The concept of mechanism has been an important organizing principle in
science and philosophy since at least the early modern period
(Dijksterhuis 1950 [1961]; Boas 1952). The nature of that organizing
principle, and precisely how it scaffolds the organization of material
knowledge, has changed considerably over time. In late twentieth
century philosophy of science, the term &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; came
to stand for a kind of theoretical structure according to which some
capacity or behavior of a whole or an endstate of a process is
explained in terms of the organization and activities of components or
antecedents. The goal of discovering mechanisms is an explicit,
guiding aim for many contemporary sciences, especially the special
sciences.</p>

<p>
But what is a mechanism? Why is mechanistic knowledge so important?
How is it related to the primary goals of science, such as prediction,
explanation and control? Are there general strategies guiding the
search for mechanisms? Are mechanisms &ldquo;real&rdquo;? How are
mechanisms at different levels related to one another? What is
required of a mechanistic explanation? And what are the characteristic
fallacies of mechanistic explanation? This family of questions, and
others besides, became a major focus in the philosophy of science at
the turn of the twenty-first century. The philosophers who took up
these questions in earnest tended to approach the topic through
detailed case studies from key developments in twentieth century
biology, with particular attention to the assumptions, constraints,
and norms revealed through scientific practice (see, e.g., Bechtel
&amp; Richardson 1993; Thagard 2000; Darden 2005; Craver 2007a; Craver
&amp; Darden 2013). Here we discuss the many areas of the philosophy
of science in which the concept of mechanism has been deployed to make
explicit and transparent key aspects of the scientific enterprise.</p>

<h2 id="WhyDidNewMechEmerLateTwenCentPhilScie">1. Why Did the &ldquo;New Mechanism&rdquo; Emerge in Late-Twentieth Century Philosophy of Science?</h2>

<p>
The term &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; has been used both as a laudatory
term, expressing the highest achievement of a given domain (especially
science and metaphysics), and as a term of derision, representing a
blinkered view of science or a narrow, lifeless, and bleak
philosophical orientation toward the world (Nicholson 2013;
Dupr&eacute; &amp; Nicholson 2018). The mechanism of the seventeenth
century, as articulated by
 <a href="../descartes-physics/">Descartes</a>,
 <a href="../gassendi/">Gassendi</a>, and
 <a href="../boyle/">Boyle</a>,
 was not univocal but came to be associated with commitments to the
unity of matter and the ultimate explicability of all change in terms
of local motion and contact action (see Boas 1952; Dijksterhuis 1950
[1961]; Gabbey 2004; Garber 1992; Roux 2017). This form of mechanism
emerged largely as a reaction to
 <a href="../aristotle-causality/">Aristotelian</a>
 emphases on formal and final causes. The banner of
&ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; was used as a rallying cry in various times
and places and sciences in the nineteenth and twentieth century (see,
e.g., Allen 2005; Nicholson 2014. For example, see Loeb as discussed
in Pauly 1987 or
 <a href="../hermann-helmholtz/">Helmholz</a>
 as discussed in Sulloway 1979). It embodied the ideals of the
science: to mathematize, to find deterministic laws, to render things
intelligible via assimilation to contact action. In many cases,
advocacy for mechanism was largely a reaction to and would-be
vanquisher of forms of organicism and
 <a href="../life/">vitalism</a>.
 No single person held all these views, and arguably no single view is
common among them all.</p>

<p>
In contrast to these earlier instantiations, the so-called &ldquo;New
Mechanism&rdquo; of the late twentieth and early twenty-first
centuries developed as a reaction to and would be successor of
 <a href="../logical-empiricism/">logical empiricist approaches to the philosophy of science</a>.
 In that service, the material commitments of mechanistic views
conflicted with the content-neutral, formal emphasis of the logical
empiricists. The methodology, moreover, took seriously the idea that
what one could say about the structure of an explanation, theory, or
science must be responsive not only to the demands of logical rigor
but also to the facts about science as practiced.</p>

<p>
The origins of the New Mechanism trace, almost without exception, to
programs in the history and philosophy of science, such as the
Conceptual Foundations of Science (CFS) Program at the University of
Chicago, and the History and Philosophy of Science Department (HPS) at
the University of Pittsburgh, or both, in the 1970s. Students and
faculty at the University of Chicago, included Lindley Darden (CFS),
Jon Elster (Philosophy; Political Science), Stuart Kauffman (Biology),
Richard Levins (Biology), William Lycan (Philosophy), Ken Schaffner
(CFS), Bill Bechtel (CFS), Bob Richardson (CFS) and, later, Stuart
Glennan (CFS). A converging strand of development ran through the
University of Pittsburgh: Peter Machamer and Schaffner (both trained
at Chicago and later joined HPS), Wesley Salmon and John Haugeland
(Philosophy), and their student, Carl Craver (HPS).</p>

<p>
This sociological fact helps explain the case-based methodology of the
new mechanists: they were especially attentive to the details of
historical exemplars of science as practiced: e.g., how claims are
tested, how models are related to the world, how explanations and
experiments are evaluated. They emphasized that the language of
contemporary biomedical and physiological sciences is animated by
background assumptions about mechanisms. That historical fact, they
argued, offers a window on the structure of the special sciences
generally. This historical, practice-centered approach built upon the
criticisms of logical empiricism by, for example, Kuhn (1962), Lakatos
(1977), and Laudan (1977). But importantly, mechanists saw in the
concept of a mechanism a fecund, material alternative to the logical
structure at the backbone of the increasingly anomaly-ridden, formal
approaches of logical empiricism. The new mechanists presented their
work as a unified treatment of the norms governing work in the special
sciences that, importantly, was modeled on what scientists actually
say and do when they make discoveries, test models, evaluate
explanations, integrate levels, and the like.</p>

<p>
These mechanists built this alternative picture by drawing together
strands from philosophy, theoretical biology, and artificial
intelligence and showing them at work in their case studies. Herbert
Simon&rsquo;s (1969) <em>Sciences of the Artificial</em> introduced
the idea of nested &ldquo;hierarchies&rdquo; of &ldquo;nearly
decomposable systems&rdquo; as heuristics for understanding complex
systems. Stuart Kaufman (1971 [1976]) developed an account of
&ldquo;articulation of parts explanations&rdquo; in developmental
biology. Lycan (1990) saw in levels of explanation a metaphysical
alternative to reductionism as a viable scientific worldview. Wimsatt
(1976a, 1976b, 1997) was for many early mechanists a crucial figure
connecting this theoretical work to discussions of reduction and
emergence in the philosophy of science. These strands began to
coalesce into an overarching perspective with Bechtel and
Richardson&rsquo;s (1993 [2010]) <em>Discovering Complexity</em>. That
book introduced the idea of mechanism as a scaffold for a model of
scientific discovery grounded in reverse engineering methods such as
decomposition and localization. The next major step in this
development, discussed in
 <a href="#WhyDoesSoMuchSciePracRevoArouMechExpl">Section 3</a>,
 connected this budding view with Wesley Salmon&rsquo;s defense of a
causal-mechanical theory of scientific explanation.</p>

<h2 id="WhatMech">2. What Is a Mechanism?</h2>

<p>
The first decade of philosophical work in the new mechanism was
directed at defining the concept of mechanism. Glennan&rsquo;s
definition was arguably the first:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A mechanism underlying a behavior is a complex system which produces
that behavior by&hellip; the interaction of parts according to direct
causal laws. (Glennan 1996: 52).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Within a decade, definitions multiplied, each with its own commitments
and implications:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are
productive of regular changes from start or set-up to termination
conditions. (Machamer, Darden, &amp; Craver 2000: 3)</p>

<p>
MECH: a necessary condition for a representation to be an acceptable
model of a mechanism is that the representation (i) describe an
organized or structured set of parts or components, where (ii) the
behavior of each component is described by a generalization that is
invariant under interventions, and where (iii) the generalizations
governing each component are also independently changeable, and where
(iv) the representation allows us to see how, in virtue of (i), (ii)
and (iii), the overall output of the mechanism will vary under
manipulation of the input to each component and changes in the
components themselves. (Woodward 2002: S375)</p>

<p>
A mechanism for a behavior is a complex system that produces that
behavior by the interaction of a number of parts, where the
interaction between parts can be characterized by direct, invariant,
change-relating generalizations. (Glennan 2002: S344)</p>

<p>
A mechanism is a structure performing a function in virtue of its
component parts, component operations, and their organization. The
orchestrated functioning of the mechanism is responsible for one or
more phenomena. (Bechtel &amp; Abrahamsen 2005: 423)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This proliferation of definitions is noteworthy for two reasons.
First, it signaled that philosophers had begun to take
&ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; seriously as a philosophical explicandum, on
par with &ldquo;law&rdquo;, &ldquo;cause&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;reduction&rdquo; (see the entries on
 <a href="../laws-of-nature/">laws of nature</a>,
 <a href="../causation-metaphysics/">the metaphysics of causation</a>, and
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>).
 The concept of mechanism had previously been mentioned in connection
with many purposes (see, e.g., Fodor 1968; Schaffner 1974; Wimsatt
1976a; Cartwright 1989), but the concept of mechanism was left
unexplicated, an &ldquo;unanalyzed term&rdquo; (Schaffner 1993: 287).
The characterizations reflect a desire to meet that challenge
directly.</p>

<p>
This proliferation also quickly revealed that different
characterizations of mechanism were designed for different purposes:
epistemology, explanation, history, metaphysics, methodology, etc.
They required different things of a mechanism, with different
implications for epistemology, metaphysics, and scientific practice
(Tabery 2004; Levy 2013; Andersen 2014a, 2014b). Are the components in
a mechanism entities, parts, or components? Do those units engage in
operations, activities, or interactions? Is a mechanism a complex
system or a structure performing a function? Must the product be a
function, a regularity, an endstate? Must the complex system behave
regularly? Must all mechanisms be composed of modular components?
Different answers seem appropriate in different contexts.</p>

<p>
To capture what is common across this diversity, Glennan and others
adopted a &ldquo;minimal mechanism&rdquo; definition that has broadly
been adopted (Glennan 2017; Glennan &amp; Illari 2017a; Glennan,
Illari, &amp; Weber 2022; for additional characterizations of a
mechanism, see Illari &amp; Williamson 2012; Fagan 2012; Ioannidis
&amp; Psillos 2018; 2022):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>A mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities (or parts) whose
activities and interactions are organized so as to be responsible for
the phenomenon.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Reference to regularity is omitted to make space for ephemeral
mechanisms that work only once or irregularly (Machamer 2004; Bogen
2005; Skipper &amp; Millstein 2005; Steel 2008; Glennan 2009; Leuridan
2010; DesAutels 2011; Andersen 2011, 2014a, 2014b; Krickel 2014). The
idea that the product of the mechanism must be a function is also
eliminated to incorporate mechanisms that serve no end. There is no
mention in minimal mechanism of Woodward&rsquo;s Simon-inspired
&ldquo;modularity&rdquo; or &ldquo;separability&rdquo; requirement,
allowing for mechanisms with degrees of near-decomposability. This
minimal definition contains abstract terms (phenomenon, entities,
parts, activities, interactions and responsible for) that can be made
concrete in lax or demanding ways, depending on one&rsquo;s
intellectual needs.</p>

<h3 id="DepiMech">2.1 Depicting Mechanisms</h3>

<p>
The canonical visual representation of a mechanism underlying a
phenomenon is shown in
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
 (adapted from Craver 2007a). At the top is the phenomenon, a system
<i>S</i> engaged in behavior \(\psi.\) This is the behavior of the
mechanism as a whole. Beneath it are the parts (the <i>X</i>s) and
their activities (the <span class="nobr">\(\phi\)s)</span> organized
together. The dotted, vertically-oriented lines display the parts and
activities as contained within the system engaged in this behavior.
This diagram emphasizes compositional relationships, and so
spatio-temporal inclusion relations, between a behaving mechanism as a
whole and the activities of its parts.</p>

 is an alternative and interchangeable representation of a mechanism
as an extended temporal process between inputs and outputs (adapted
from Craver, Glennan, &amp; Povich 2021). Relations among inputs and
outputs constitute the behavior of the mechanism as a whole. The
mechanism is made of items that mediate between those inputs and
outputs (see Pearl 2014). This figure also makes it easier to
understand etiological mechanistic explanations, in which the endpoint
\((\psi_{\textrm{out}})\) is the explanandum phenomenon and the
antecedent process is its etiological (causal) history. This
representation also allows that the same entity might appear over and
over again, engaged in different activities at different temporal
stages of the mechanism (or the same activity again). It also allows
that the entities might not be clearly localized and spatially
isolated from one another (for further discussion, see Craver,
Glennan, &amp; Povich 2021; Gebharter 2014; Gebharter &amp; Kaiser
2014).</p>

Consider an example. The &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo; refers to the
climate mechanism that traps solar energy within the Earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere. This naturally occurring process is essential to life on
Earth because it allows the Earth to retain some of the sun&rsquo;s
heat. Human release of high levels of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and other gases into the atmosphere has begun to perturb this
system. The sun emits electromagnetic radiation in the visible and
ultraviolet frequencies, which pass through the Earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere. The Earth, at its normal temperatures, emits radiation
mainly in the infrared. The greenhouse gases, though, specifically
absorb electromagnetic radiation in the infrared, resulting in heat
that gets in but can&rsquo;t get out.
 <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>
 depicts some key components in this mechanism (e.g., the sun, Earth,
the atmosphere), the relevant operations of those parts (e.g.,
radiating solar energy, re-radiating heat, trapping heat), and the
organizational relationship between those elements of the mechanism
(e.g., that earth is <em>surrounded by</em> the atmosphere, which is
<em>made of</em> gasses as parts). The difference left to right
depicts the explanation of how human activities contribute to the
earth&rsquo;s warming.</p>

Each of these interchangeable representations has five elements: (1)
the phenomenon, (2) the parts, (3) what the parts are doing, and (4)
the organization of the system, which (5) often includes reference to
levels. We now discuss how these elements might be further
specified.</p>

<h4 id="Phen">2.1.1 Phenomenon</h4>

<p>
All mechanisms are mechanisms <em>of</em> some phenomenon, a
consequential truism first articulated by Kaufman (1971 [1976]) and
sometimes dubbed &ldquo;Glennan&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; (see, e.g., Glennan
1996, 2002). For example, the mechanism of protein synthesis
synthesizes proteins. The boundaries of a mechanism&mdash;what is in
the mechanism and what is not&mdash;are fixed by their relevance to
the phenomenon (see also
 <a href="#MechReal">Section 5</a>).
 Kaiser and Krickel (2017) argue that phenomena should generally be
construed as <em>object-involving occurrents</em>, where an object (or
system) is engaged in a certain occurring, which could be a process,
an event, or a state. An object might be a cell or an ion channel;
examples of occurrents include, respectively, contracting and
activating.</p>

<p>
What is it for a mechanism to &ldquo;be responsible for&rdquo; a
phenomenon? This might mean that the mechanism <em>produces the
phenomenon</em>. Such language is most appropriate when the
explanandum phenomenon is the (presumed) terminus of a causal process
(as in
 <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>),
 what Salmon (1984) dubbed the etiological aspect of causal-mechanical
explanation. In other cases, &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; might be better
explicated as &ldquo;underlying&rdquo;, especially when one seeks what
Salmon (1984) calls constitutive explanations.
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
 emphasizes a spatial interpretation of underlying: being made of
smaller parts.
 <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>
 emphasizes causal mediation: to underlie an input-output relationship
is to be the mechanism in virtue of which those inputs are transformed
into those outputs. Some combination of these two perspectives is
surely required of any adequate way of thinking about mechanisms (see
 <a href="#EtioConsCausMechExpl">Section 3.1</a>
 on Constitutive and Etiological Explanation).</p>

<p>
Some understand &ldquo;responsible for&rdquo; in still other ways,
e.g., in terms of &ldquo;maintaining&rdquo; (Craver &amp; Darden 2013)
or &ldquo;controlling&rdquo; (Bich &amp; Bechtel 2022; Bechtel 2022;
see also the entry on
 <a href="../cell-biology/">philosophy of cell biology</a>).
 These ways of talking often can be inter-translated with one another
(e.g., the product is produced, the product<em>ion</em> has an
underlying mechanism) so long as one is clear about precisely what the
phenomenon is supposed to be. K&auml;stner (2021) argues that these
different ways of being &ldquo;responsible for&rdquo; allow scientists
to integrate different kinds of explanatory knowledge about complex
systems.</p>

<h4 id="Part">2.1.2 Parts</h4>

<p>
What is a part of a mechanism? The axioms of mereology are too
abstract and formal to capture the rich sense of parthood
characteristic of mechanistic sciences (see Sanford 1993; Craver
2007a,b; Wimsatt 1976a; see the entry on
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>).
 Again, different intellectual projects lead scholars to adopt
stronger and weaker constraints.</p>

<p>
In metaphysical disputes about the nature and limits of physicalism,
some have committed to the idea that mechanisms are composed of
&ldquo;physical parts&rdquo;, though the idea of being
&ldquo;physical&rdquo; is itself a promissory note for further
analysis. Some emphasize features of causal processes: parts are items
that make intelligible contributions to some phenomenon (Haugeland
1998; Machamer, Darden, &amp; Craver 2000; Kaiser &amp; Krickel 2017).
On that view, parts are individuated only secondary to units of
activity.</p>

<p>
Parts have also been understood as nearly decomposable components,
where the interactions within components are stronger than between
components (Craver 2001; Haugeland 1998; Simon 1969) or as modular
sub-components (Woodward 2001). Glennan proposes an even stronger
requirement: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The parts of mechanisms must have a kind of robustness and reality
apart from their place within that mechanism. It should in principle
be possible to take the part out of the mechanism and consider its
properties in another context. (Glennan 1996: 53) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This notion is perhaps too strong to accommodate the more ephemeral
parts of some biochemical mechanisms or of the mechanisms of natural
selection (Skipper &amp; Millstein 2005; but see Illari &amp;
Williamson 2010).</p>

<h4 id="Caus">2.1.3 Cause</h4>

<p>
Four ways of unpacking the cause in causal mechanism have emerged over
time (Oleksowicz 2021). First, the conserved-quantity approach,
developed by Phil Dowe (2011), takes mechanistic causation to be the
transmission of conserved quantities (e.g., momentum, mass-energy)
within and by a mechanism. Second, mechanists such as Jim Bogen (2005,
2008), Darden (2013), and Machamer (2004), have advocated for an
activity-based account, where the search for some general, unifying
notion of causation is non-reductively replaced with the
identification of specific, productive activities. Such accounts
typically look to science determine what are and are not activities
(e.g., pulling, firing, resting) and what are the key features of
those activities (see also Illari &amp; Williamson 2013).
Counterfactual accounts are a third variant found in the mechanism
literature, often employing a manipulationist view of counterfactual
causation. To say that one component is a cause of another is to say,
roughly, that one could change the second by intervening on the first
(Woodward 2002; Craver 2007). Finally, mechanistic accounts of
causation, provided by Glennan (1996, 2009, 2017), understand
non-fundamental causation as derivative from the concept of a
mechanism; the truth-makers for causal claims at one level are
mechanisms at a lower level.</p>

<p>
Each of these accounts has faced criticism. The conserved-quantity
account, it has been noted, struggles to do useful work outside
fundamental physics and have difficulty accommodating mechanisms of
omission and double prevention (Glennan 2002; Craver 2007a; Williamson
2011). Activity-based accounts are faulted for not saying anything
deeper about what activities are (Psillos 2004), for failing to
account for the relationship between causal and explanatory relevance
(Woodward 2002), and for failing to make sense of cases of polygenic
effects (Persson 2010). Critics of counterfactual approaches tend to
emphasize difficulties of stating truth-conditions on the relevant
counterfactuals and emphasize actual (vs. possible) causation in
mechanisms (Bogen 2005, 2008; Machamer 2004). Glennan&rsquo;s
mechanistic account has been charged with circularity, since the
concept of a mechanism invariably contains a causal element. These
accounts of causation are, for the most part, borrowed from classic
discussions in metaphysics and reflect different ways of responding to
Hume&rsquo;s causal skepticism; the problems associated with them
often turn on their (in)adequacy as a response (Andersen 2014a, 2014b;
Matthews &amp; Tabery 2017).</p>

<h4 id="Orga">2.1.4 Organization</h4>

<p>
&ldquo;Organization&rdquo; is a distinguishing feature of mechanisms
as opposed to aggregates (see entry on
 <a href="../levels-org-biology/">levels of organization in biology</a>;
 Wimsatt 1997). Aggregate properties are simple sums of the properties
of the parts. Organization is non-aggregative arrangement, where
different parts enter into a variety of organizing relations,
interacting with one another to do something the individuals cannot do
on their own.</p>

<p>
There are many forms of organization, including spatial, temporal,
causal, or hierarchical (Paoletti 2021). Spatial organization, for
example, includes location, size, shape, position, and orientation;
temporal organization includes the order, rate, and duration of the
component activities (Machamer, Darden, &amp; Craver 2000). Dynamical
models in particular may reveal complex temporal organization in
interactive mechanisms (Bechtel 2006, 2011, 2013; see also the entry
on
 <a href="../cell-biology/">philosophy of cell biology</a>).
 There are also more abstract patterns of organization (Alon 2007; see
Levy 2014; Levy &amp; Bechtel 2013).</p>

<p>
Modular organization, in which components are nearly decomposable
sub-parts of a mechanism, has been of particular interest. Some
counterfactual accounts of mechanism (Woodward 2001, 2002, 2014;
Menzies 2012) require that the causal relations in mechanisms be
&ldquo;modular&rdquo; in the sense that it should be physically
possible to intervene on a putative cause variable in a mechanism
without disrupting the functional relationships among the other
variables in the mechanism. Steel (2008) articulates a weaker form of
modularity in his probabilistic analysis of mechanisms&mdash;one that
follows directly from Simon&rsquo;s (1969) idea of nearly decomposable
systems. On Simon&rsquo;s view, the parts of a system have more and
stronger causal relations with other components in the system than
they do with items outside the system. The idea of modularity, and the
relations among these distinct articulations, are ripe for future work
(see Matthews 2019).</p>

<h4 id="Leve">2.1.5 Levels</h4>

<p>
Mechanisms and theories about them typically span multiple levels (see
especially Craver 2001, 2007a, 2016; Craver &amp; Darden 2001).
Mechanistic thinking about levels traces to Simon&rsquo;s (1969)
parable of the often-distracted watchmakers, Tempus and Hora. Simon
argued that Tempus, who builds hierarchically decomposable watches,
will build more watches than Hora, who builds holistic watches, given
that decomposable watches tend to fail locally while holistic watches
tend to fail globally. For analogous reasons, Simon argues, evolved
structures are more likely to be nearly decomposable into
hierarchically organized assemblages at multiple levels of
organization.</p>

<p>
From a mechanistic perspective, levels are not monolithic divides in
the furniture of the universe (as represented by Oppenheim &amp;
Putnam 1958), nor are they fundamentally a matter of size or of the
exclusivity of causal interactions within a level (Wimsatt 1976a).
Rather, levels of mechanisms are defined locally within a multilevel
mechanism: one item is at a lower level of mechanisms than another
when the first item is a part of the second and when the first item is
organized (spatially, temporally, actively) with the other components
such that together they realize the second item (Craver 2007b, 2016;
Povich &amp; Craver 2017). Craver defines levels of mechanisms in
terms of a relationship between the behavior \((\psi)\) exhibited by a
system (<i>S</i>) and the activity \((\phi)\) of some component part
(<i>X</i>) of that system (see
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
 above). On this account, <i>X</i>&rsquo;s \(\phi\)-ing is at a lower
level of mechanistic organization than <i>S</i>&rsquo;s \(\psi\)-ing
if and only if (i) <i>X</i> is a part of <i>S</i>, and (ii)
<i>X</i>&rsquo;s \(\phi\)-ing is a component in <i>S</i>&rsquo;s
\(\psi\)-ing. In short, to say that something is at a lower
mechanistic level than the mechanism as a whole is to say that it is a
working part of the mechanism. Alternatively, but equivalently (see
 <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>),
 if <i>A</i> is described as an input-output relation
\((A_{\textrm{in}} \rightarrow A_{\textrm{out}}),\) then the
lower-level components are the causal intermediates between input and
output (Craver, Glennan, &amp; Povich 2021; see also Prychytko 2021).
Levels of mechanisms seem to play a central role in structuring the
relations among many different models in contemporary biology (e.g.,
between Mendelian and molecular genetics (Darden 2006), between
learning and memory and channel physiology (Craver 2007a), and between
population-level variation and developmental mechanisms (Tabery 2009,
2014)).</p>

<p>
Some crucial features of this account should be noted:</p>

<ul class="hanging jfy">

<li> <strong>Parts and wholes.</strong> Mechanistic levels are a
species of part-whole relation delimited by the causal organization
characteristic of mechanism. Unlike Oppenheim and Putnam, however,
mechanistic levels are composed by a distinctive mechanistic
componency relation.</li>

<li> <strong>Relata.</strong> The relata are the behavior of a
mechanism as a whole, at the higher level, and the components and
activities in the mechanism at the lower level.</li>

<li> <strong>Relevance.</strong> Because the componency relation is
defined by constitutive relevance (see
 <a href="#LimiCLModeConsExpl">Section 3.2</a>),
 interlevel relations are defined relative to a specified top-most
phenomenon. Different choices of phenomena are generally associated
with different decompositions and so a different interlevel structure
(Simon 1969; Kauffman 1971 [1976]; Craver 2007a. This is why levels of
mechanism are local rather than monolithic.</li>

<li> <strong>Size.</strong> Levels of mechanisms are not defined by
size relations, though a size ordering follows from the fact that
things at lower-levels can take up no more space than things at higher
levels. Unlike size-driven views of levels (see Wimsatt 1976a), this
view allows that things of radically different sizes might be found at
the same level. Explanations might require going up a size level, as
when facts about independent assortment are explained by reference to
chromosomes during cell division (see Darden 2006).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This view of levels forms the abstract background against which
mechanistic views of reduction, emergence, interlevel causation, and
interfield relations are articulated (see
 <a href="#HowDoDiffScieDiscRelaOneAnot">Section 6</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
This background picture has been widely discussed and criticized.
Leuridan (2012) argues that this view of levels is incoherent, perhaps
presupposing the idea of part-hood it should explicate. Potochnik and
McGill (2012) argue that the concept of level mischaracterizes the
messy relations found in science and insists on a homogeneous
composition of things at a single level (though arguably this is not
true of mechanistic levels). di Frisco (2017) argues against
mechanistic conceptions of levels, largely on the ground that it has
no content over and above claims about token composition and defends
instead a time-scale based account of levels that will hold across
types. Eronen (2013; 2015), in contrast, rejects the mechanistic
notion of levels on the grounds that it imposes no homogenous
composition of things at a single level, which while true is taken by
advocates of the notion as one of its distinctively positive. Brooks
(2017) defends the continued utility of the levels metaphor, including
levels of mechanisms, in scientific practice. Kaiser (2015) develops a
broader notion of levels in the same spirit as the mechanistic
approach, but not restricted to mechanistic part-whole relations.
Bertolaso and Buzzoni (2017) respond to Eronen&rsquo;s criticisms and
provide a pluralistic account of higher-level causes grounded in the
mechanistic literature and exemplified in recent work in cancer
epigenetics. Harbecke (2015) uses the mechanistic theory plus some
features of his regularity account of constitution to recover a notion
of level that works in the neurosciences.</p>

<h3 id="WhatMechNot">2.2 What Mechanisms Are Not</h3>

<p>
The term &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; has a complex history, bringing with
it many dangers in the effort to use the term for a new, highly
proprietary project. New mechanists have therefore been especially
vocal in distancing their view from some especially misleading
associations.</p>

<ol>

<li> Mechanisms are not necessarily <em>deterministic</em>. They might
be stochastic. They might be composed of stochastic activities (Bogen
2005, 2008; Craver 2007a), or chancy simply because of instability in
the arrangement and interaction of the component parts.</li>

<li> Mechanisms are not limited to <em>push-pull dynamics</em>
(Machamer, Darden, &amp; Craver 2000). Descartes&rsquo; mechanism had
this feature, but new mechanists explicitly liberalize the notion to
allow other kinds of causing.</li>

<li> Appeal to mechanisms is not necessarily <em>reductionistic</em>.
The assumption that mechanism and reductionism go hand-in-hand is
probably the most commonly misplaced intuition about the concept. Much
of the early work by philosophers of mechanism focused on fields like
biology and psychology, where the express purpose was to make sense of
how mechanisms scaffold the effort to build multilevel explanations,
and mechanistic organization has been a key argument in favor of
higher-level causes (Bechtel 2009; McCauley &amp; Bechtel 2001; Craver
2007;
 <a href="#HowDoDiffScieDiscRelaOneAnot">Section 6</a>
 below).</li>

<li> Not all mechanisms are <em>machines</em>. All machines have
mechanisms within them, but machines and their mechanism are
individuated separately. Machines are designed for a function;
mechanisms need not be (Darden 2006). Machines can be on or off;
mechanisms are how things work and, when they involve machines, they
are machines in action (Machamer, Darden, &amp; Craver 2000) rather
than merely a static and inert arrangement of parts.</li>

<li> Mechanisms are often not <em>sequential</em> or <em>linear</em>.
Mechanisms can have feedback loops and cycles (Bechtel 2011). They can
also be organized so as to maintain an equilibrium, something that
might appear static but is in fact the product of active regulation
(Bechtel 2022).</li>

<li> Mechanisms are not necessarily <em>localized.</em> Components of
mechanisms might be distributed and might violate intuitions about the
boundaries of objects. The assumption of localization is often an
important heuristic in the search for mechanisms (Bechtel &amp;
Richardson 1993 [2010]); however, it is an heuristic that sometimes
has to be abandoned.</li>

<li> Mechanisms are not just <em>fictions/metaphors</em>. When a
scientist says that there is a mechanism that makes proteins in living
organisms, she is not just using a machine metaphor; rather, she is
saying that there are in fact parts and activities organized in living
organisms such that they produce proteins.</li>

<li id="point8"> Mechanisms do not necessarily come
<em>pre-packaged</em> out in nature. Mechanisms are bounded, instead,
by relevance to the phenomenon they explain.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="WhatNotMech">2.3 What Are Not Mechanisms</h3>

<p>
Some object that there&rsquo;s so little left to the idea of mechanism
once it sheds its historical associations and evades its
detractors&rsquo; criticisms as to make the notion trivial
(Dupr&eacute; 2013; Shapiro 2017; Weiskopf 2011; Woodward 2017).</p>

<p>
Consider just mechanistic theories of explanation: the history of
science contains many other conceptions of scientific explanation and
understanding that are at odds with this commitment. Some have held
that the world should be understood in terms of divine motives. Others
emphasize explanations in terms of telos and purpose. Others have held
that the aim of science is prediction, not explanation, and so
downplay the value of mechanistic knowledge. Still others emphasize
laws, a common contrast with mechanisms (Leuridan 2010; Craver &amp;
Kaiser 2013).</p>

<p>
But what, the critic might push further, does <em>not</em> count as a
mechanism? Here are some of the more obvious contrast classes:</p>

<ol>

<li> <em>Entities</em> (or <em>objects</em>) are not mechanisms.
Mechanisms do things. If an object is not doing something (i.e., if
there is no phenomenon), then it is not a mechanism. (But see
 <a href="#MechReal">Section 5</a>
 for how this links up with types, tokens, and kinds.)</li>

<li> <em>Correlational patterns</em> are not mechanisms. Mechanisms
explain at least many correlations, and many correlations can be used
to characterize causal or mechanistic relations, but correlations
patterns themselves are not mechanistic.</li>

<li> Mere <em>temporal sequences</em>. Wednesday follows Tuesday, but
not in a mechanistic sense, again, because they are not causally
related.</li>

<li> Mere <em>spatial arrangements</em>. One can describe how parts
are organized in space without regard to whether or how those parts
are organized causally. A jigsaw puzzle, for example, is not a
mechanism.</li>

<li> <em>Inferences</em>, <em>reasons</em>, and <em>arguments</em> are
not mechanisms. Though there are mechanisms by which inference and
reasoning are realized, what makes something an inference or a reason
is logical relation and not (merely) a causal relationship between
premise and conclusion. Likewise, mathematical proofs are not
mechanisms.</li>

<li> <em>Symmetries</em> are not mechanisms. Many kinds of symmetry
are of fundamental importance in different areas of physics (e.g.,
translational symmetries, rotational symmetries). These are features
of physical systems that are highly general facts or assumptions, not
mechanisms.</li>

<li> <em>Fundamental laws</em> and <em>fundamental causal
relations</em> are not mechanisms. If a law or causal relation is
fundamental, then (by definition) there is no mechanism for it.</li>

<li> <em>Relations of logical and mathematical necessity are not
mechanisms.</em> Such truths hold in all possible worlds and so do not
depend for their truth on facts about the causal structure of this
world.</li>

<li> <em>Taxonomies</em> are not mechanisms. The periodic table, for
example, does not describe a mechanism, though it contains information
about how innumerable mechanisms work.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Importantly, to be a non-mechanism is not to be worthless. Not
everything scientists do involves the search for mechanisms. But much
of it does. </p>

<h2 id="WhyDoesSoMuchSciePracRevoArouMechExpl">3. Why Does So Much Scientific Practice Revolve Around Mechanistic Explanation?</h2>

<p>
Those who unite under the label of mechanism in contemporary
philosophy have by and large attempted to build a charitable and
defensible reconstruction of what &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; might mean
as an objective for sciences as diverse as economics, cognitive
science, molecular biology and different branches of physics. In that
effort, they emphasized the centrality of causation (over strict
deterministic laws) and the importance of integrating explanations
across levels of organization.</p>

<p>
Many scientists think of explanation in broadly causal-mechanical
terms: to explain a phenomenon <i>P</i> is to know the causes for or
the mechanisms underlying <i>P</i>. This idea contrasts with the
covering law (CL) model of explanation, developed by logical
empiricists such as Ayer (1936) and Hempel (1965), according to which
explanations are arguments with law statements as premises, and by
unificationists (the U model), such as Friedman and Kitcher, who
associate explanatory power with reducing the number of brute facts or
argument schemas that must be taken for granted while maximizing scope
and stringency (see the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-explanation/">scientific explanation</a>).</p>
 
<p>
There is now broad consensus that both the CL model and the U model
fail to express accurately the norms governing the scientific
practices of constructing, evaluating, and revising scientific
explanations. One common thread of criticism (Bromberger 1966; Salmon
1984; Scriven 1959) is that they cannot distinguish laws from
regularities (the light postulate vs. the fact that no golden bust of
Donald Trump is greater than 500 kg), causal laws from non-causal
regularities (deriving the length of the shadow from the height of the
flagpole rather than vice versa), or predictions from explanations
(predicting storms from barometer readings vs. pressure changes). (See
other entries on
 <a href="../laws-of-nature/">laws of nature</a>,
 <a href="../ceteris-paribus/">ceteris paribus laws</a>, and the
 <a href="../causation-metaphysics/">metaphysics of causation</a>.)
 At the core, the CL model, the U model, and the empiricist approaches
each exemplify, arguably preclude explicit reference to the causal and
mechanistic structures scientists claim to seek when they build, test,
and revise their explanations.</p>

<p>
Considerable confusion can be avoided by carefully distinguishing the
representations used to convey information about a mechanism (models)
and the mechanisms (causal structures) themselves. The same confusion
attends the CL model, in which one can emphasize arguments (models) or
laws (nomic structures). Some philosophers write and think in ontic
mode, emphasizing the first of these (Salmon 1989; Lewis 1986; Craver
2014; Strevens 2013). Other authors write in representational mode
(for example, C. Wright &amp; Bechtel 2007). Failing to understand and
track this difference leads often to absurdity (see Illari 2013; see
also K&auml;stner &amp; Haueis 2021).</p>

<h3 id="EtioConsCausMechExpl">3.1 Etiological and Constitutive Causal-Mechanical Explanations</h3>

<p>
Salmon (1984) distinguished two &ldquo;aspects&rdquo; of causal
mechanical explanation, two ways of situating something in the causal
structure of the world: etiological and constitutive. Etiological
explanations reveal the causal history of the explanandum phenomenon.
For example, the rising temperature explains why the balloon expands.
Constitutive explanations, in contrast, explain a phenomenon by
describing the mechanism underlying it, revealing its internal causal
structure. For example, the balloon expands when heated because the
mean kinetic energy of the molecules increases and their collective
impact with the container thus assumes a greater force. Salmon focused
on etiological explanations and did not develop an account of the
constitutive aspect. This lacuna became a primary focus of new
mechanists.</p>

<p>
<em>Contra</em> some critics (by, e.g., Woodward 2017; Rescorla 2018),
it is not part of the mechanistic theory of explanation that
phenomenal laws must lack explanatory content. This charge rests on
the failure adequately to distinguish these two aspects of
explanation. Etiological explanations can and often do cite causes for
an effect (e.g., smoking as the explanation for lung cancer) without
describing the mechanism linking the cause to the effect. Even if the
causal relationship is sustained by a mechanism (as in Glennan 1996)
and even if assumptions about those mechanisms are crucial for
evaluating evidence about causal relations (Russo &amp; Williamson
2007; Illari 2011; Illari &amp; Ruso 2014; see
 <a href="#MechEvidMediDisc">Section 4.2</a>),
 etiological explanations work by providing information about how the
explanandum is situated with respect to the antecedent causal
structure. And one might satisfy this requirement by describing a
single, salient difference-maker. Constitutive explanations, in
contrast, are defined by the fact that they provide information about
the internal causal structure of the explanandum. The gas law does not
explain why balloons expand when heated; rather it says that they
always do. Whether or not phenomenal laws are explanatory are depends
on the explanandum and the contextually salient aspect of explanation
under request.</p>

<h3 id="LimiCLModeConsExpl">3.2 Limits of the CL Model of Constitutive Explanations</h3>

<p>
The key norms governing the practices of building, evaluating, and
revising constitutive mechanistic explanations are poorly reflected in
the rational reconstructions of the covering law model and the U
model. A key advance in the work on constitutive mechanistic
explanation has been to make those norms explicit. These norms frame
our discussion:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li id="norm1"> <strong>Purely Phenomenal Explanations.</strong> That
a powder has a hallucinogenic virtue does not explain, but rather
redescribes its capacity to produce hallucinations. Constitutive
mechanistic explanations of that phenomenon explain why the powder
causes hallucinations.</li>

<li id="norm2"> <strong>Relevance.</strong> Scientific explanations
include only relevant factors about how a mechanism works; they
exclude irrelevant factors.</li>

<li id="norm3"> <strong>Correctness.</strong> To know the explanation
is to know how the mechanism actually works, not merely how it might
have worked. What counts as correct enough varies with pragmatic
context.</li>

<li id="norm4"> <strong>Completeness.</strong> Mechanistic
explanations can be more or less complete for different pragmatic
ends. Scientific progress often (but by no means invariably) involves
filling in schema terms for phenomena with details of the underlying
mechanism.</li>

<li id="norm5"> <strong>Intelligibility.</strong> Explanatory models
ought to induce understanding in consumers with the relevant
background knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The CL model,
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/">as applied to laws of nature</a>,
 arguably has difficulty with each of these norms (see Craver 2007a).
A redescription with appropriate bridge laws might count as an
explanation according to that model (<em>contra</em>
 <a href="#norm1">norm 1</a>).
 The CL model requires that explanations must be true, satisfying the
spirit of
 <a href="#norm2">norm 2</a>
 but in a way which famously rules out the use of idealized models in
explanations. Just as the view supplies no account of causal relevance
 (<a href="#norm3"> norm 3</a>),
 it places no constraints on the relevance of variables appearing in
constitutive explanations (except that they should be in true
generalizations). The CL model counts any sound argument that cites
true conditions and laws as a complete explanation; this fails to
accommodate the idea that constitutive explanations might be more or
less complete for a given purpose (<em>contra</em>
 <a href="#norm4">norm 4</a>).
 The intelligibility of CL explanations
 (<a href="#norm5">norm 5</a>)
 lies in the inferential (logical) relation between explanans and
explanandum, but whether anyone understands the explanans and what it
tells us about the phenomenon is (for better or worse) not a condition
on the explanation. Similar complaints have been raised against the U
model, the empiricists&rsquo; nearest descendant.</p>

<p>
Early work on constitutive mechanistic explanation was motivated by
these limitations in the CL mode and the U model. It was also
motivated as an effort to fill in an important promissory note in the
most prominent work on causal explanation (Salmon 1984; Woodward
2003): namely, to analyze the constitutive aspect of causal-mechanical
explanation,</p>

<h3 id="PurePhenMode">3.3 Purely Phenomenal Models</h3>

<p>
The idea of a purely phenomenal model is familiar from the practice of
scientific modeling (Mauk 2000; Kay 2018), and has been broadly
adopted by mechanists (see, e.g., Bunge 1963; 1997; Craver 2007a,
2010; Glennan 2002, 2005; Kaplan &amp; Bechtel 2011; Kaplan &amp;
Hewitson 2021; Kaplan &amp; Craver 2011). Craver and Kaplan (2020)
offer this definition: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a model, <i>M</i>, is a phenomenal model of a mechanism if and only if
it describes the inputs to, modulators of, and outputs from a
mechanism without describing its relevant internal causal structure.
(2020: 296) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To distinguish purely phenomenal models from constitutive explanatory
models, Kaplan and Craver (2011) describe a &ldquo;model-to-mechanism
mapping&rdquo; (3M) requirement on constitutive explanations: for a
model of a mechanism to go beyond being a purely phenomenal
redescription, it must reveal some details about the underlying
mechanism. Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In successful explanatory models in cognitive and systems neuroscience
(a) the variables in the model correspond to components, activities,
properties, and organizational features of the target mechanism that
produces, maintains or underlies the phenomenon, and (b) the (perhaps
mathematical) dependencies posited among these variables in the model
correspond to the (perhaps quantifiable) causal relations among the
components of the target mechanism. (Kaplan &amp; Craver 2011:
611)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage has been misread in many telling ways. It does not assert
that a model must describe all the details of a mechanism to count as
explanatory. Nor does it assert that a model that contains more
details about a mechanism is always better or more explanatory than a
model that contains fewer details (the so-called &ldquo;more details
better&rdquo; thesis as originally articulated by Levy &amp; Bechtel
2013 and repeated by Levy 2014; Chirimuuta 2014; Batterman &amp; Rice
2014; for a general discussion and clarification, see Craver &amp;
Kaplan 2020). The 3M requirement is nothing more or less than the
inverse of the truism that a constitutive explanation must convey some
information about the underlying mechanism (Craver &amp; Kaplan 2020
call this SDN: Some details are necessary). Third, 3M should not be
read (see, e.g., Kaplan &amp; Craver 2011: 609&ndash;610; Kaplan 2011:
347), as denying the importance of idealized and abstract models.
Whether it is compatible with the minimal models discussed by, e.g.,
Batterman and Rice, and what this does or not entail for such putative
explanations, is still an area of active interest (Povich 2018;
2021).</p>

<p>
Finally, 3M is consistent, as explained above, with the thesis that
so-called phenomenological laws might convey explanatory information,
as in an etiological explanation. One can explain the gas&rsquo;
expansion by adverting to the fact that it was heated without going
into the molecular theory of gasses. That is compatible with 3M and
the thesis that phenomenal models (as defined above) are explanatorily
empty as constitutive explanations for those phenomena (see Siegel
&amp; Craver 2024).</p>

<h3 id="ConsExplRele">3.4 Constitutive Explanatory Relevance</h3>

<p>
A central task of a theory of causal (etiological) explanation is to
explicate the notion of causal and explanatory relevance by which
things are included or excluded from explanations. (See entries on
 <a href="../causation-counterfactual/">counterfactual theories of causation</a>,
 <a href="../causation-probabilistic/">probabilistic theories of causation</a>, and
 <a href="../causation-mani/">manipulationist theories of causation</a>.)
 An analogous problem confronts any theory of constitutive
explanation; to sort relevant components from irrelevant parts (Craver
2007a; Ylikoski 2013). A mechanism (<i>S</i>) exhibiting (responsible
for) phenomenon \((\psi)\) is composed of many different entities
(<i>x</i>), with various properties, engaging in myriad activities
\((\phi)\) organized together (see
 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
 above in
 <a href="#WhatMech">Section 2</a>).
 The philosophical puzzle is to articulate a principle by which
entities, activities, and organizational features that contribute to
the phenomenon are sorted from those that do not. The aim is to
articulate a theory of constitutive relevance.</p>

<h4 id="AgaiCausAcroLeveMech">3.4.1 Against Causation Across Levels of Mechanisms</h4>

<p>
Can the idea of causal relevance serve as a basis for explanatory
relevance in both constitutive and etiological explanations? This
option, without further elaboration, faces some significant, perhaps
insurmountable, conceptual challenges.</p>

<p>
The fact that the behavior of a mechanism is composed in some sense of
the entities and activities of its parts, combined with certain
familiar assumptions about causal relations, suggests that there can
be no causal relationships between items at different levels of
mechanisms (Lewis 1986; Kim 1992; Povich and Craver 2017). Why is
interlevel causation problematic for mechanistic levels? One source of
the problem is that the putative interlevel causes and effects are not
independent of one another (Lewis 1986); they stand in compositional
relations. And because they compose one another, the parts and the
wholes change simultaneously (in apparent violation of the temporal
asymmetry of causation) and symmetrically (in apparent violation of
causal asymmetry of cause and effect) (as Kim1992 emphasizes; see
Gebharter (2014, 2022) on how to translate the mechanistic approach
into a diachronic formalism of Causal Bayes nets that nonetheless
adheres to the strictures presented here). Finally, if one understands
the activities of parts as causally between the start and finish of
the mechanism (see Prychitko 2021; Craver, Povich, &amp; Glennan
2021), the transformation that constitutes the whole is incomplete
(i.e., does not yet exist) when the part changes, and the change to
the part comes after the portion of the whole that occurs before it
(Craver 2011; Craver, Glennan, and Povich 2021). For these reasons,
causation across levels of mechanisms is at best conceptually
awkward.</p>

<p>
How can one square this conceptual awkwardness with the fact that so
many scientists seem to find the idea of top-down causation
illuminating? Craver and Bechtel (2007) argue that claims asserting
interlevel causation are in fact hybrid propositions, combining
non-causal claims about relations between part and whole with causal
claims expressing relations between things not related as part and
whole. Another, compatible, alternative is to take many sensible
claims about interlevel causation to involve a different conception of
&ldquo;level&rdquo; from mechanistic levels, such as levels of size,
levels of theories, or levels of complexity, where these reasons
against part-whole causal relations do not (univocally) apply. See the
entry on
 <a href="../levels-org-biology/">levels of organization in biology</a>.
 </p>

<h4 id="ConsReleMutuMani">3.4.2 Constitutive Relevance as Mutual Manipulability </h4>

<p>
What is constitutive relevance if not a causal relationship between
wholes and parts? One important starting place has been the mutual
manipulability account (MM) of constitutive relevance (originally
formulated in Craver 2005, 2007a). Craver uses MM to articulate a
sufficient condition on constitutive relevance. The account was based
in the experimental manipulations used to test interlevel relations in
practice. According to this account, if it can be shown </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="show1"> that the putative component is spatially within
<i>S</i>, </li>

<li id="show2"> that some ideal interventions on the putative
component (<i>x</i>&rsquo;s \(\phi\)-ing) changes the phenomenon
(<i>S</i>&rsquo;s \(\psi\)-ing), and </li>

<li id="show3"> that some ideal interventions on <i>S</i>&rsquo;s
\(\psi\)-ing change <i>x</i>&rsquo;s \(\phi\)-ing, that is sufficient
to establish that <i>x</i> is a component in the mechanism. </li>
</ol>

<p>
MM, however, has not proved entirely satisfying. First, it offers only
a sufficient condition; Craver (2005, 2007a), for example, discusses
examples of intuitively relevant parts that do not satisfy the
condition. Second, the use of interventionist counterfactuals in
conditions
 <a href="#show2">(ii)</a>
 and
 <a href="#show3">(iii)</a>
 suggests a causal interpretation, contravening the explicit denial of
interlevel causation (as argued by Baumgartner &amp; Gebharter 2016;
though see Krickel 2018a,b). Third, the notion of an
&ldquo;ideal&rdquo; intervention, borrowed from Woodward&rsquo;s
account of causal relevance, cannot apply (absent clarification) to
constitutive explanations. An ideal intervention on a system cannot
intervene on both the independent and the dependent variable at the
same time. However, when one intervenes to make <i>S</i> \(\psi\) (or
to prevent <i>S</i> from \(\psi\)-ing), one invariably also intervenes
on the components of <i>S</i>&rsquo;s \(\psi\)-ing. And when one
intervenes on the components of <i>S</i>&rsquo;s \(\psi\)-ing, one
often intervenes on <i>S</i>&rsquo;s \(\psi\)-ing. Because
<i>x</i>&rsquo;s \(\phi\)-ing and <i>S</i>&rsquo;s \(\psi\)-ing are
related as part to whole, they are not independent, and so cannot be
causally related, as just discussed (see Baumgartner 2010, 2013;
Leuridan 2012; yet see Menzies 2012; Woodward 2015). Finally, MM
appears to presuppose the idea of being &ldquo;contained
within&rdquo;; the boundaries of mechanisms are themselves determined
by considerations of relevance (Leuridan 2012). These criticisms
suggest to many that MM, if it is coherent, is at best an account of
the evidence by which claims of constitutive relevance are tested (see
Couch 2011; see also Romero 2015).</p>

<p>
A path out of these problems, dimly suggested in Craver (2007a,b), has
begun to emerge through the work of Menzies (2012), Harinen (2018),
Krickel (2018a and 2018b) and Prychytko (2021), and, most recently,
Craver, Glennan, and Povich (2021). Echoing work on causal mediation
(see, e.g., Pearl 2014), Menzies suggests that a component is a
necessary link in a causal chain between input and output. Building on
this work, Craver, Glennan, and Povich (2021) distinguish the
epistemic aims of MM from a metaphysical theory of constitutive
relevance as causal betweenness. According to that view, MM (properly
formulated) works as an epistemic condition because the interlevel
experiments, in fact, are tests of different causal claims that pose
no special problem of interpretation in the language of the
interventionist theory of causation (Craver, Glennan, &amp; Povich
2021).</p>

<p>
A second approach involves a regularity account of constitutive
relevance modeled on Mackie&rsquo;s notion of understanding a cause as
an INUS condition: (Mackie 1980; see also Cummins 1983). On this
account, a constitutively relevant component is an
<strong>I</strong>nsufficient but <strong>N</strong>on-redundant part
of an <strong>U</strong>nnecessary but <strong>S</strong>ufficient
mechanism for a given phenomenon (Couch 2011; 2023; see also Harbecke
2010, 2015). As a theory with impeccable empiricist credentials, this
view looks good out of the gate. Its legs will be tested as a theory
of the metaphysics and in its ability to deal with mechanism tokens
rather than types.</p>

<p>
A third approach to constitutive relevance relies on the idea that
interventions on the behavior of a mechanism as a whole are
&ldquo;fat-handed&rdquo; with respect to the activities of the
components. An intervention is fat-handed to the extent that alters
more than one causally relevant variable at once (Eberhardt and
Scheines 2007). Romero (2015) , soon followed by Baumgartner and
Gebharter (2015) argued that interventions on the behavior of a
mechanism as a whole are invariably fat-handed with respect to
interventions on their parts. Baumgartner and Casini (2017) use this
idea to develop an &ldquo;abductive theory&rdquo; of constitution,
where the conclusion that parts are constituents of a mechanism is
arrived at abductively from recognition that phenomena and their
constituents are unbreakably coupled via common causes. For criticisms
of this account, see Krickel (2018a; 2018b).</p>

<p>
This debate will bear fruit especially if it is pursued with mindful
respect to the complex relationships (not identities) between
questions of epistemology, metaphysics, and scientific practice. In
attempting to articulate a regulative ideal for scientific explanation
one might take it as a mark of success to bring these three aspects of
the scientific endeavor, i.e., the world, our understanding of it, and
our means of knowing it, together into a mutually satisfying picture
of the science of mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="CompCorr">3.5 Completeness and Correctness</h3>

<p>
Theories of explanation famously wrestle with puzzles specifying the
norms of completeness and correctness for explanations. Can one say
that an explanation should be correct without asserting that no
idealized model is explanatory? Can one assess explanations for their
completeness without insisting that abstract models (which necessarily
drop detail) must be non-explanatory or explanatorily deficient in
some respect? These issues, while not unique to mechanistic
explanation, have been discussed with some vigor in the effort to
clarify these norms in this mechanistic context.</p>

<p>
At the heart of this discussion is a distinction between the
mechanisms themselves and the models (or explanatory texts) scientists
use to represent them. Two subtly different problems of scientific
explanation, one concerning texts and the other concerning their
referents, are apt to be conflated, leading to considerable confusion.
Although the distinction is often characterized as between an
&ldquo;ontic&rdquo; and an &ldquo;epistemic&rdquo; conception, those
terms are not always used in the same way. Contrary to the sense
introduced by (Coffa 1974; Salmon 1989), the apparent fault line is
between those who emphasize the ontic aspect of explanation (e.g.,
Salmon 1989; Strevens 2013 ; Craver 2007a, 2014) and those who
emphasize <em>representational</em> aspects of explanation (see
Bechtel &amp; Abrahamsen 2005). This way of casting the matter,
however, is somewhat misleading, given that no defender of the ontic
approach denies that scientists use representations to convey
explanations (as emphasized by Illari 2013). Speaking in the ontic
mode, one emphasizes the worldly relations to which a correct
explanatory model would refer; speaking in the representational mode,
one emphasizes instead the way information about the worldly relations
is being conveyed. These are entirely different topics.</p>

<p>
It is also illuminating to note the important distinction between a
model that contains explanatorily relevant information about a
mechanism and a mechanistic model. A model of a mechanism, in a broad
sense of &ldquo;of&rdquo;, might be any representation (physical
model, mathematical structure, etc.) produced or used to convey
information about a mechanism, i.e., its representational target. See
the SEP entry on
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>).
 A mechanistic model, specifically, is a model of mechanism that
represents the component entities and activities and shows how they
act and interact with one another (see Glennan 2005). But a model or
representation of a mechanism might depict, for example, the evolution
of the states of the mechanism as a whole over time or merely features
of its anatomical layout. They would not be mechanistic in this fuller
sense, though they do contain mechanically relevant information. Many
models, mechanistic or not, are typically combined in the process of
giving detailed mechanistic explanations (see Hochstein 2016,
2017).</p>

<h4 id="Comp">3.5.1 Completeness</h4>

<p>
Models represent intelligibly in virtue of abstracting, i.e., dropping
detail from, their mechanistic targets. It is a pragmatic matter
whether and when a model of a mechanism is &ldquo;complete
enough;&rdquo; it depends on the aims and expectations for which the
model is constructed. Glennan (2005) explains that there is no hard
line between complete and incomplete models; they are always evolving,
through articulation and refinement of their commitments, and
invariably incomplete in some sense. That said, the effort to identify
gaps in one&rsquo;s understanding of a mechanism often drives
mechanistic research in practice.</p>

<p>
Building on this simple idea, Darden distinguished mechanism schemas
and mechanism sketches (Darden &amp; Cain 1989; Darden 1996. Mechanism
schemas are abstract descriptions of mechanisms that can be filled in
with details to yield a specific type or token mechanism. For example,
the schema, &ldquo;DNA &rarr; RNA &rarr; Protein&rdquo; can be filled
in with a specific sequence of bases in DNA, its complement in RNA,
and a corresponding amino acid sequence in the protein; the arrows can
be filled in, showing how transcription and translation work. A
mechanism sketch, in contrast, is an incomplete representation of a
mechanism that specifies some of the relevant entities, activities,
and organizational features but leaves gaps that cannot yet be filled.
Black boxes, question marks, and filler-terms (such as
&ldquo;activate&rdquo;, &ldquo;cause&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;inhibitor&rdquo;) are used in practice to hold the place for
some entity, activity or process yet to be discovered. The distinction
between sketches and schemas is perhaps too dichotomous to accommodate
what is in fact always a matter of relative completeness and
abstraction.</p>

<p>
All models of mechanisms abstract away from potentially obfuscating
details (Craver &amp; Darden 2013; Strevens 2008; Levy &amp; Bechtel
2013), even explanatorily relevant details. But surely to assert as
much is already to commit oneself to the idea that there is more to be
known about the mechanism than the explanatory model expresses. Craver
and Kaplan suggest one should let the mechanism itself serve as a
measure of completeness: the mechanism contains all and only the
relevant parts, properties, activities, and organizational features
for the phenomenon in question. A complete model or family of models
(should such a thing be desired, if possible, in practice) would
describe the mechanism in all its gory details (Craver &amp; Kaplan
(2020) call this idea &ldquo;Salmon completeness&rdquo;). Even this
inclusive model is restricted to relevant facts about the mechanism
(weeding out irrelevancies). Note also that the effort to define and
endpoint of completeness for this rather normative purpose does not
commit one to the idea that Salmon-incomplete models are useless,
non-explanatory, or even necessarily deficient for the purposes at
hand. Such a view would arguably entail that we have never had an
explanation and never will, in principle.</p>

<p>
Some object to what they see as the mechanist&rsquo;s emphasis on
detail (Chirimuuta 2014; Levy &amp; Bechtel 2013; Batterman &amp; Rice
2014; Weiskopf 2011; Woodward 2017). They associate mechanism with an
obsessive focus on smallest details without regard to relevance (a
sense that is, indeed, common enough in science). Such
&ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; is often missing the forest for the trees. But
this objection appears to be directed at a common caricature of the
mechanist rather than at anything any new mechanist has asserted. For
rejoinders, see Povich (2017; 2018).</p>

<p>
In assessments of completeness, it is perhaps better to ask questions
about the amount of explanatory information a model contains than
about whether the model is explanatory simpliciter. A model of a
mechanism has explanatory value, one might think, to the extent that
it contains information about how the mechanism actually works. It is
a further question how much information that model contains and so how
explanatory that model is (cf. Lewis 1986 on causal explanation. For
an exploration of the sense of &ldquo;information&rdquo; involved in
such claims, see Povich 2021).</p>

<p>
Why has there been any friction here at all? For many philosophers and
scientists (including at least some of the authors of this essay), it
increasingly appears that science is often unproductively driven, and
often in the name of mechanism, by a self-sustaining need to deploy
the latest fancy tools to deliver ever more detailed data about the
microscopic and often irrelevant aspects of a system. To recognize
completeness as a norm can be seen as giving comfort to these
unproductive endeavors. Another possible source of this apparent
conflict arises for those who deny that there is a fact of the matter
about what belongs in the set of all and only the relevant components.
It might help, however, to think of completeness as a relative notion,
definable without knowing an absolute endpoint.</p>

<h4 id="Corr">3.5.2 Correctness</h4>

<p>
Just as there is a difference between understanding and
misunderstanding, there is a difference between explaining and
apparently explaining. Explaining is what happens when apparent
explaining succeeds. In the case of mechanistic explanations, a
constitutive explanation for a phenomenon involves providing
information about the components, properties, activities and
organizational features that actually produce, underlie, or maintain
it. Apparent explanations can be produced by models that describe
parts, properties, activities and organizational features that perhaps
could exhibit the phenomenon but that do not actually produce,
underlie, or maintain it.</p>

<p>
To capture these common-sense ideas, mechanists emphasize the
distinction between a how-possibly schema and a how-actually-enough
schema (Craver &amp; Darden 2013). A how-possibly schema describes how
entities and activities might be organized to produce a phenomenon. A
how-possibly model is a hypothesis about how the mechanism works. Such
models might be true (enough) or false. A true (enough) how-possibly
model is (though we may not know it) also a how-actually (enough)
model. A how-actually-enough schema describes how entities and
activities are in fact (or close enough) organized to produce the
phenomenon. The term &ldquo;how-actually-enough&rdquo; captures the
idea that the requisite &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo; of a mechanistic model
can vary considerably from one pragmatic context to another (Weisberg
2013). A false how possibly model (Dray 1968; Brandon 1984) is a false
hypothesis about how the mechanism works. (For a subtly different
take, see Brainard 2020).</p>

<p>
Some object to the idea of correctness on the grounds that models of
mechanisms often introduce idealizing assumptions to bring the
relevant feature of the mechanism most clearly into view: infinite
populations, frictionless planes, perfect geometrical shapes are
presumed in order to strip the model of detail that does not matter
for, or would only obstruct, the intended purposes of the model. This
fact poses a significant problem for anyone who claims a model must be
true to be explanatory (such as the covering law model and some
representationalist theories). Those who emphasize the ontic aspect of
explanation typically allow that idealized models convey information
about features of the mechanism. A model might be correct in some
respects and not others. And how correct a model must be depends,
again, on how the model is being used in practice (see Povich 2015;
2018). Some mechanists and critics simply resist the idea that there
is a fact of the matter about how a mechanism works. Arguably, most of
the recent work on mechanisms has been carried out against a backdrop
of tacit or explicit commitments to some form of perspectival realism
(see Section 5 of the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-realism/">scientific realism</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="Inte">3.6 Intelligibility</h3>

<p>
A model that makes use of representational structures that the
audience is unprepared to comprehend will fail as a vehicle of
understanding. This banal observation has nothing to do with
explanation per se but with human communication more generally;
communication fails when an audience is unequipped to digest the
message. We should therefore separate the intelligibility of the model
or text <em>per se</em> from the intelligibility of the model as a
representation of an explanation specifically. Call this latter
explanatory intelligibility. Our question now: How do models render
mechanisms explanatorily intelligible?</p>

<p>
The most obvious answer is perhaps: By providing a <em>mechanistic
model</em>: a model that represents the component entities and
activities and shows how they act and interact with one another such
that they are responsible (etiologically, constitutively) for the
phenomenon (see Glennan 2005). Many things contribute to the
intelligibility of mechanistic models. They represent an orderly
temporal sequence of changes and so exhibit stages by which something
unfolds. They depict these orderly changes as the result of component
forms of change that are taken antecedently as unproblematic or,
perhaps, simpler (in the sense that they must be organized together
with other activities to produce the phenomenon) than the phenomenon
itself. Third, they represent a kind of teleological perspective, in
which an endpoint of the mechanism is achieved as a consequence of the
activities at earlier stages. Fourth, mechanistic models, when
possible, represent spatial arrangements that explain why the
activities unfold as they do: things are inside or outside a membrane,
things change conformations, things are fitted to one another in a
kind of joint productivity (Fagan 2012). One might say that
mechanistic models provide a species of narrative intelligibility (as
Gabe Siegel suggests, by personal communication) by which one comes to
see how an end-state is produced through the activities of actors
arranged in time and space.</p>

<p>
But one can convey information about a mechanism with models that are
not &ldquo;mechanistic&rdquo; in this sense. Giving a mechanistic
explanation often involves combining information contained in many
different models, only some of which are mechanistic models (see
Hochstein 2016) Dynamical models, for example, can be used to describe
the temporal evolution of a phenomenon or the temporal arrangement of
a mechanism&rsquo;s parts (Kaplan &amp; Bechtel 2011; Kaplan 2011;
Ross 2015). Network models can be used to describe, for example,
spatial and causal information about the organization of parts (Levy
2013, 2014; Levy &amp; Bechtel 2013) or general topological
constraints on the behavior of the mechanism as a whole (see Huneman
2010). Levy, in particular, emphasizes the role of abstraction on
network diagrams in generating abstract descriptions of higher-level
patterns in the organization of complex systems, repeated motifs of
organization that behave in relevantly similar ways (Levy 2014) across
very different kinds of mechanisms. So-called minimal models show that
a phenomenon results not from any particular arrangement of component
parts but rather from general constraints assumed to govern any
arrangement of the relevant kinds of component parts (see, e.g.,
Batterman &amp; Rice 2014; Povich 2018). Cascades and causal pathways
(Ross 2021) are often used to convey information about possible canals
of causal influence and directions of change possible in a system
responsible for many phenomena without describing any one set of
actual causal interactions responsible for a single phenomenon.</p>

<p>
Hochstein (2016, 2017) argues that most explanations require many
different models, each of which provides a piece of explanatory
information that must be integrated with the others to understand know
how the mechanism works. Because they make different idealizing
assumptions and abstract away from different features of the
mechanism, any conjunction of all the models is bound to contain
contradictions. The assumption of a one to one correspondence between
models and explanations is a philosophical fiction belied by
scientific practice. The idea that all models must be mechanistic to
convey information about the mechanism is a simple conflation. What
intelligibility we recover in our quest to know the causal structure
of the world often emerges at the intersection of different half
truths and outright lies, different kinds of models that tell us
different things about the parts, their interactions, and their
organization across multiple levels of mechanistic organization. Or so
advocates of the ontic conception are prone to say on the topic of
intelligibility.</p>

<h2 id="HowDoScieDiscMech">4. How Do Scientists Discover Mechanisms?</h2>

<p>
In contrast to those who would draw a hard line between discovery and
justification and assign reflections on justification to psychologists
and educational scholars (Reichenbach 1938; Popper 1959; Hanson 1958;
Laudan 1980; and Nickles 1985; see also entries on
 <a href="../scientific-discovery/">scientific discovery</a>,
 <a href="../scientific-method/">scientific method</a>,
 <a href="../reichenbach/">Hans Reichenbach</a>,
 and
 <a href="../popper/">Karl Popper</a>),
 the concept of mechanism has proved an important inroad into thinking
about heuristics of scientific discovery (see esp. Bechtel &amp;
Richardson 1993 [2010]; Darden 2006; Craver &amp; Darden 2013). This
discussion, unfortunately, has remained fairly disconnected from the
formal, computational literature on causal discovery and search
(Spirtes, Clymour, &amp; Scheines 1993 [2000]; Pearl 2009). Useful
work can be directed at exploring what, precisely, each of these
approaches to discovering the world&rsquo;s causal structures has to
offer, their limits, and their possibilities of fruitful interaction
(though see Gebharter 2017; Gebharter and Kaiser 2014). Recent work on
causal mediation affords another fruitful avenue of collaboration,
especially in light of recent developments in understanding
constitutive relevance (see Weinberger 2019).</p>

<p>
The material structure of a mechanism, even minimal mechanism, offers
inroads in thinking concretely about how to reason one&rsquo;s way
through a scientific discovery problem. Historical exemplars of
mechanism discovery (e.g., Harvey&rsquo;s circulation of the blood,
Crick&rsquo;s central dogma, Hodgkin and Huxley&rsquo;s work on the
action potential) reveal a taxonomy of reasoning strategies at play in
discovering the mechanism for a phenomenon.</p>

<p>
This orientation and approach trace to Bechtel and Richardson&rsquo;s
<em>Discovering Complexity</em> (1993 [2010]), which is organized
around a flowchart of choice-points in mechanism discovery. The
process of searching for mechanisms begins with a provisional
characterization of the phenomenon. Then follow strategies for
<em>localizing</em> the mechanism within the system and
<em>decomposing</em> the phenomenon into distinct sub-functions. The
flowchart also contains various &ldquo;exit ramps&rdquo; for what
happens when these assumptions fail. Craver and Darden (2013) discuss
decomposition as just one of a dozen or so strategies scientists use
to address different questions in the search for mechanisms (see also
the entries on
 <a href="../cell-biology/">philosophy of cell biology</a>
 and
 <a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="StraDisc">4.1 Strategies of Discovery</h3>

<p>
Darden&rsquo;s work on discovery strategies in Mendelian genetics
(Darden 1986, 1991) expanded as she explored more specific strategies
of mechanism discovery (Darden 2006, 2009, 2018). Darden characterizes
the process of mechanism discovery as extended, iterative, and
piecemeal; it is composed of cycles of construction, evaluation, and
revision of mechanism schemas in light of theoretical and empirical
constraints.</p>

<p>
Construction strategies are strategies for generating new mechanism
schemas. Darden shows that scientists often <em>borrow a schema
type</em> from another area of science, as when selection-type
mechanisms were borrowed to understand how the immune system works, or
assemble a mechanism from known modules of functional activity
(<em>modular sub-assembly</em>) (Darden 2006). Sometimes, scientists
know one part of the mechanism and attempt to work forward
(<em>forward chaining</em>) or backward (<em>backward chaining</em>)
through to the other parts and activities. Far from being
philosophically inscrutable, discovery proceeds as scientists use what
they know about the working entities and activities in the mechanism
to infer what could come next or before (Darden 2006; see also the
entries for how this worked in the cases of
 <a href="../genetics/">genetics</a>
 and
 <a href="../molecular-biology/">molecular biology</a>).
 More formal approaches to causal discovery abstract from the material
details required to explicate this common form of reasoning in science
(cf. Norton 2003).</p>

<p>
<em>Robotic simulation</em> is a construction strategy, premised on
the idea that building something is a way of coming to understand it
or of best demonstrating your understanding (e.g., Jacques Loeb 1912
as described in Pauly 1987; Haugeland 1998; Dretske 1994). Edoardo
Datteri discusses this robotic strategy at work in learning how
sensorimotor mechanisms such as chemotaxis, phonotaxis, and
hippocampal navigation contribute in ways that theoretical models of
the same systems cannot (Datteri 2009; Datteri &amp; Tamburrini
2007).</p>

<p>
Evaluation strategies involve <em>constraint-based reasoning</em> to
shape the space of possible mechanisms for a given phenomenon in light
of available evidence. Some of these involve discovering aspects of a
mechanism&rsquo;s organization through observation; others involve
manipulating the mechanism with patterns of interventions. For
example, one might intervene to remove a putative component to see if
and how the mechanism functions in its absence (<em>inhibitory</em>
experiments). Or one might <em>stimulate</em> that component to see if
one can drive the mechanism or modulate its behavior. Or one might
<em>activate</em> a mechanism by placing it in the precipitating
conditions for the phenomenon and observe how the entity or activity
changes as the mechanism works. Craver (2007a) discusses these under
the heading of &ldquo;interlevel experiments&rdquo; (see also Harinen
2018). Craver and Darden (2013) discuss many complex ways of arranging
interventions and detections to answer different questions about a
mechanism&rsquo;s organization.</p>

<p>
Revision strategies involve considering varieties of error and their
plausible sources: in the experimental apparatus, in data analysis,
or, as in the case of &ldquo;monster anomalies&rdquo; and
&ldquo;special case&rdquo; anomalies, in the target population itself.
Possibilities for revision might involve adjusting any of the major
features of a mechanism: the phenomenon, various parts, their
activities, their organization; one often exploits the near-modular
organization of a mechanism to tweak one&rsquo;s theory in one part
while leaving much of the rest as it is.</p>

<p>
The effort to describe such strategies, and their application to
problem areas in science, has been a productive area of research (see,
for example, Bechtel 2009, 2019; Braillard 2015; Gervais &amp; Weber
2015; Zednik 2015; van Eck &amp; Mennes 2018). Open projects include
the continued exploration of strategies at work in different areas of
science, for different kinds of mechanisms, and to answer different
kinds of questions about them. Finally, as mentioned above, the
relationship between these heuristics and causal discovery methods in
the computational sciences seems prime for exploration (see Spring
&amp; Illari 2019, and also the entry on
 <a href="../simulations-science/">computer simulation in science</a>).
 </p>

<h3 id="MechEvidMediDisc">4.2 Mechanistic Evidence and Medical Discoveries</h3>

<p>
The concept of mechanism has become an important fulcrum in disputes
in the philosophy of medicine that, in fact, ramify across the
mechanistic sciences (see the entries on
 <a href="../medicine/">philosophy of medicine</a>
 and
 <a href="../biomedicine/">philosophy of biomedicine</a>).
 One dispute concerns the relation between statistical and mechanistic
evidence in the evaluation of a causal hypothesis. Mechanistic
evidence is understood to be evidence about the mechanism&rsquo;s
parts and their diverse forms of organization. Is one more valuable
than the other? Is &ldquo;mechanistic evidence&rdquo; of minimal
value, as indicated by its position on the hierarchy of evidence in
evidence-based medicine? Or is &ldquo;mechanistic evidence&rdquo;
required to render statistical forms of evidence reliable and
meaningful?</p>

<p>
Thagard (1998, 2000) uses the discovery that <em>H. pylori</em>
bacteria cause ulcers as an exemplar for investigating how causal and
mechanistic discoveries are made. Thagard draws attention to both
statistical evidence that ulcers are associated with <em>H.
pylori</em> and to mechanistic evidence that can explain how the agent
of infection could persist in a hostile environment, to argue for the
causal hypothesis. Russo and Williamson argue that both types of
evidence are typically required to justify causal inference; the
correlational evidence establishes that there is a difference-making
relation between some cause and some effect, while the mechanistic
evidence establishes how exactly the cause produces its
effect&mdash;the &ldquo;Russo-Williamson Thesis&rdquo; (Russo &amp;
Williamson 2007).</p>

<p>
Philosophers have since refined this thesis, pointing out that
&ldquo;type of evidence&rdquo; could refer to different methodologies
for gathering evidence or to different objects of evidence.
Difference-making methodologies include observational studies and
randomized controlled trials, while mechanistic methodologies might
include interventionist experiments or research involving non-human
animal models; likewise, the object of evidence could be the evidence
of an associated difference or it could be the evidence concerning the
mechanism linking the cause and effect (Illari 2011; Campaner 2011;
Scholl 2013; Fiorentino &amp; Dammann 2015; Vineis, Illari, &amp;
Russo 2017). Evidence-based medicine hierarchies, which rank different
kinds of evidence in terms of their epistemic strength, tend to
prioritize evidence from difference-making methodologies (such as
randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) over mechanistic
evidence; in reply, these philosophers argue that the different types
of evidence are on a par (each with its own strengths and weaknesses)
and advocate for integrating difference-making and mechanistic
evidence, a sentiment which aligns with the emphasis on mechanism
integration discussed below (Clarke et al. 2013, 2014).</p>

<p>
Steel (2008) focuses on strategies for extrapolating from a sample
population or a model organism to the structure of a mechanism in the
target. Steel considers how researchers get around what he calls the
extrapolator&rsquo;s circle: determining how we could know that the
model and the target are similar in causally relevant respects without
already knowing the causal relationship in the target. Steel breaks
the extrapolator&rsquo;s circle by developing a mechanisms-based
extrapolation strategy&mdash;the strategy of <em>comparative process
tracing</em>. One need not compare the mechanism in its entirety, but
can find convincing evidence by targeting attention at key
similarities. Craver (2022) uses this idea to argue for the relative
significance of bottle-neck points or bow-tie structures in complex
mechanisms (see entries on
 <a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>
 and
 <a href="../molecular-biology/">molecular biology</a>).
 For additional discussion, see Illari and Russo 2014; Darden, Pal,
Kundu, and Moult 2018; Parkkinen et al. 2018; and Auker-Howlett &amp;
Wilde 2020.</p>

<h2 id="MechReal">5. Are Mechanisms Real?</h2>

<p>
Are mechanisms real? Are they objective bits of furniture in the
world? Does the world come &ldquo;pre-carved&rdquo; into mechanisms?
Is there a causal structure of things independent of its registration
in the human mind? Not surprisingly, mechanists differ in their
commitments on these metaphysical questions, as they do on causation,
constitution, relevance and a host of other specific matters. Yet
because this question persists, it is worth surveying some things that
mechanists have said about the topic. In doing so, it becomes apparent
that the dominant thread of mechanistic research defends a rather
nuanced and individually varying blend of the perspectival and the
objective. Here we lay out some key components of a view that deserves
status as something like a default view. </p>

<p>
The perspectival element of this default view appears most prominently
in discussions of the importance of the phenomenon in framing
mechanistic explanations, in discussions of functional explanation,
and in discussions of the relationship between mechanisms and natural
kinds. The objective component of the default view, rooted in facts
about causation and constitution that are independent of human
perspective, only comes into view against the backdrop of these
perspectival determinants. </p>

<h3 id="MechDefiRelaPhen">5.1 Mechanisms Are Defined Relative to Phenomena</h3>

<p>
A central claim across many areas of the mechanism literature is that
mechanisms are defined only relative to a phenomenon. Bechtel and
Richardson (1993 [2010]) begin their decision-tree of mechanism
discovery with the characterization of the phenomenon. Glennan (1996:
52) writes, &ldquo;One cannot even identify a mechanism without saying
what it is that the mechanism does&rdquo;. More recently, Craver
(2013: 141) writes, &ldquo;In a slogan, mechanisms are the mechanisms
of the things that they do&rdquo;. This idea, which traces at least to
Stuart Kauffman&rsquo;s discussion of articulation of parts
explanations, is now sometimes called &ldquo;Glennan&rsquo;s
Law&rdquo; (see, e.g., Glennan 1996, 2002). On all these views,
mechanisms are defined only relative to the phenomenon they cause,
underlie, or otherwise explain (see
 <a href="#point8">Section 2.2 point 8</a>).
 Which phenomena we are interested in causing, creating, or explaining
is surely a perspectival matter. So some kind of perspectival element
is presumed in most of the literature on mechanisms.</p>

<p>
Notice, however, that the choice of phenomenon is not entirely
arbitrary. As Craver (2007a) notes, it has to exist (unlike the id or
witches), it has to have causal powers, it has to survive the kind of
scrutiny that scientific constructs routinely survive. Indeed, as
Bechtel and Richardson note, mechanism discovery typically involves
&ldquo;reconstituting the phenomenon&rdquo;, shifting our
understanding of what we are trying to explain as we learn more about
it and as we seek its putative explanation. We should not forget that
the choice of which phenomena are appropriate targets for explanation
is in part an empirical matter, a matter of how things have to go when
you look at things more closely and try to explain them.</p>

<p>
So at the level of phenomena, we find a mixture of perspectival and
objective constraints. Our explanatory and translational interests
focus attention on key portions of the causal structure of the world.
But it is possible for us to be objectively wrong about where we are
directing our interests. Indeed, being wrong is probably common, as
the causal structure of the world is often very messy. Craver, for
example, tends to follow William James: it is &ldquo;busy and buzzing
confusion&rdquo; (Craver 2013: 140) or &ldquo;blooming, buzzing
confusion&rdquo; (Francken, Slors, &amp; Craver 2022: 14). The task of
building mechanistic explanations is, on his view, an effort to tame
that confusion, to make sense of that world in ways that are
intellectually and pragmatically fruitful.</p>

<h3 id="DiviMechPart">5.2 Dividing Mechanisms into Parts</h3>

<p>
The question of how the component entities and activities of a
mechanism are to be distinguished from one another is itself an
immensely complicated issue that blends perspectival and objective
elements. How do you chunk a mechanism into components, paragraphs of
activity, non-overlapping enough with one another to constitute
distinct existences? Just as we can ask whether the world comes
pre-chunked into mechanisms, we can ask whether a mechanism comes
pre-chunked into parts.</p>

<p>
To settle this matter, we need a principle to tell us when we have one
part and when we have two. And surely this chunking procedure that we
perform will be guided by things that are relevant to us: which
chunkings render the working of the mechanism transparent to us, which
chunkings give us relatively simple generalizations we can deploy,
which chunking best highlights the intended target of our
intervention. But again, the process is not without objective
constraint.</p>

<p>
One source of constraint comes from patterns in the relevant portion
of the causal structure of the world. If we envision that causal
structure as a network of causes, with nodes and edges, Simon argued,
we can understand components as sub-networks in that structure made of
nodes that interact with one another more or more strongly than they
do with items outside that node (Simon 1969). Components are, in other
words, to be identified as modules, in a sense that there now exist
algorithms to detect (e.g., Fortunato 2010). Of course, one can decide
to ignore the advice of the clustering algorithm, lumping things it
tells you to split or splitting things it tells you to lump, but the
point Simon emphasizes is that, in many systems, especially evolved
systems, we should expect them to display nested hierarchies of nearly
decomposable components within nearly decomposable components.</p>

<p>
There are theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that large
swathes of the world are multiply nearly decomposable, that the
&lsquo;buzzing confusion&rsquo; can be chunked up in different useful
ways. Simon (1969) gave us the parable of the watchmakers, Tempus and
Hora (see
 <a href="#Leve">section 2.1.5</a>).
 Tempus builds nearly decomposable watches, and Hora builds holistic
watches with no neatly separable parts. When they are interrupted, as
they frequently are, Tempus loses all his work on that one part, but
Hora loses whatever progress she&rsquo;s made on the watch as a whole
and must start from scratch. The analogy to evolution is indirect but
powerful (Steel 2008): systems with nearly decomposable organization
can suffer damage to a part without global collapse; systems that
develop through the operation of nearly decomposable mechanisms can
sustain interruptions to one part of that process while maintaining
development around that failure; systems with nearly decomposable
structure afford opportunities for evolutionary tinkering that
holistic systems do not. Modular organization&mdash;in the sense of
near decomposability&mdash;is precisely what we should expect in
evolved systems or, more broadly, in systems that display robustness
in the face of changing environmental conditions. Moreover, that seems
to be what the sciences are telling us about the parts of the world
they study (see, for example, Melo &amp; Marroig 2015; Kashtan &amp;
Alon 2005; Kreimer et al. 2008; Wagner 1996). If one does attempt to
&ldquo;cut nature&rdquo; at joints that fail to respect lines of
near-decomposability, one is likely to have difficulty finding
economical generalizations to express the composing relations. This is
because chunking will crosscut thickets of interactions that render
their behavior intelligible to us most at their interfaces, where the
variables are relatively few in number. Are we forced to pay attention
to nature about these decisions? No. But we are well advised to do so
as best we can. So while our perspectives are important, the causal
structure of the world plays a large part.</p>

<h3 id="Func">5.3 Functions</h3>

<p>
Mechanisms are often described in terms of functions. Sometimes, the
phenomenon to be explained is some function performed by a mechanism.
Sometimes the operations of the parts are described as functions, as
in the &ldquo;localization of function&rdquo; in neuroscience. Yet
what precisely this means varies considerably from one mechanist to
the next.</p>

<p>
Sometimes the idea of function is understood in a more objective
sense. One way is to conceive of function as a distinctive kind of
etiology (<em>&agrave; la</em> Wimsatt 1974; L. Wright 1973; Neander
1991). Garson (2013), for example, requires that a mechanism, in order
to be a mechanism for a phenomenon, must have been selected in some
sense for having performed that phenomenon. Other mechanists see
functional ascription, much like mechanistic description, as an
organizing principle for foregrounding some causal relations and
backgrounding others in a world of busy buzzing causal confusion.
Following Cummins&rsquo; (1975) view of analytic explanations, Craver
(2001, 2013) for example describes the attribution of functions as an
&ldquo;upward looking&rdquo; effort to situate something in the causal
structure of the world, such as the intake valve in the behavior of an
engine or the kidney in the context of the osmoregulatory system. To
describe its role-function in this sense is simply to see it as part
of a higher-level mechanism, to foreground the causal relations
relevant to what that mechanism does and to background everything
else. This is what Craver means when he says that, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Theoretical terms such as vesicle, neurotransmitter, receptor,
channel, and ocular dominance column are conspicuously functional,
describing entities not in terms of size, shape, and motion but in
terms of their job or role in the behavior of a system. (Craver 2013:
134) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea of a role-function applies not only to biological and social
systems but even to systems for which talk of natural selection is
strained at best; see Illari and Williamson (2012), who treat
functions as &ldquo;characteristic activities&rdquo; in astrophysics.
This growing use of Cummins&rsquo; account of role-functions is
recognized even by critical recent papers (e.g., Dewhurst &amp; Isaac
2023).</p>

<p>
Both Craver and Cummins are committed to the idea that such functional
descriptions are perspectival. One might see the kidney as a component
in blood pressure regulation and the valve as part of a noise
production mechanism, and this will lead one to foreground different
aspects and background those we previously found so interesting. But
notice that, as with the case of phenomena, once we have decided what
we find interesting, the facts pick up from there. For a
role-functional description to be true, it has to capture how the item
is situated in that higher-level causal mechanism; this is an
objective matter, independent of whether anyone ever notices. And it
implies, straightforwardly, strong constraints on the content of
functional ascription and, so, on how such ascriptions can be and are
tested in practice.</p>

<h3 id="KindMechMechBoun">5.4 Kinds of Mechanisms and Mechanism Boundaries</h3>

<p>
A theme emerges from this philosophical work: the world has a causal
structure that places, however messily at times, objective constraints
on the phenomenon, the decomposition of parts, and the descriptions of
the roles things play, although we might choose to attend to different
causal facts depending on our interests. Nothing in this, so far,
tarnishes the objectivity of mechanisms. On these views, the
boundaries of mechanisms, what is in and what is out, are determined
fundamentally by relevance to the phenomenon of the mechanism,
although which phenomena we are interested in depends on pragmatic
interests. In the process of discovery, too, findings about parts and
boundaries may lead us to reconstitute or recharacterize the
phenomena. Yet even this view is consistent with the view that there
are phenomena and that, given those phenomena, there is an objective
fact about what things are and are not causally or constitutively
relevant to them.</p>

<p>
Craver (2009) critically examines the idea that in the special
sciences one can identify kinds with the mechanisms underlying
homeostatic property clusters, the HPC view of natural kinds (Boyd
1991, 1999, 2000; Kornblith 1993; see also Tobin 2017, and the entry
on
 <a href="../natural-kinds/">natural kinds</a>).
 According to one, narrow understanding of that view, the similarity
of property clusters is underwritten by the existence of a mechanism
that maintains their co-occurrence. Caver argues that there is no
uniquely correct grain of abstraction saying when the mechanism is the
same or different enough for inclusion in the kind.</p>

<p>
Craver develops earlier work into an explicitly perspectival view:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The pluralist will insist that the boundaries of kinds are not
completely arbitrary&mdash;as radical constructivists might hold. The
legitimate causal kinds have to respect the causal structure of
things; but that causal structure can be described in many ways
(abstracting more or less, and here rather than there) each yielding a
possibly legitimate way of carving the taxonomy of kinds, depending on
one&rsquo;s needs. (Francken, Slors, &amp; Craver 2022: 12) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In that paper, they describe a &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; of kinds,
containing two hermeneutically circular loops that feed back on one
another in the effort to define psychological kinds.</p>

<p>
Glennan and Illari (2017a) take on the principles by which mechanisms
are and can be sorted into kinds of mechanism. They argue there is not
one single way, but rather multiple useful (and equally objectively
grounded) ways of building principled taxonomies of mechanisms,
including varieties of phenomena, varieties of entities, activities
and interactions, varieties of organization and etiology. These
different ways of abstracting to types of mechanism, even for the same
phenomenon, strongly indicate that whether two items are of the same
type will depend on what type we care about. But once we settle that,
there would appear to be a further fact of the matter. Again,
mechanisms show a curious blend of the perspectival and the objective,
recognized in the mechanisms literature.</p>

<h3 id="GradPersReal">5.5 Grades of Perspectival Realism</h3>

<p>
Let us call this kind of blending of the perspectival and the
objective or real <em>perspectival realism</em> (following Giere 2006)
to acknowledge the contributions of both to our understanding of
mechanisms. Different metaphysical presumptions, epistemological
proclivities, and downright intuitions divide mechanists into how much
to weight these two aspects of the position.</p>

<p>
One interesting possible difference among mechanists is how they
interpret Glennan&rsquo;s law. Strong versions of Glennan&rsquo;s law,
for example, seem to suggest that the determination of the phenomenon,
by itself, determines what will or will not be in the mechanism.
Craver (2009) seems to embrace this kind of strong view. And Dewhurst
and Isaac (2023) seem to interpret Craver and other mechanists as
embracing something like that direction of fit.</p>

<p>
In other places, however, Craver (2007a) seems to acknowledge the
historical fact that the characterization of the phenomenon and the
understanding of the mechanism often co-evolve, as recognized already
by Bechtel and Richardson (1993 [2010]). That is, the conceptual
entailment relationship between the phenomenon and the set of all and
only relevant components should not be taken to suggest anything about
the historical process by which one comes to understand a mechanism,
where that understanding develops at two or more levels at once. As
Churchland (1993) argues, our understandings of what is going on at
different levels tend to &ldquo;co-evolve&rdquo; under mutual
adjustment and calibration; how we think of parts and wholes remains
fluid over the course of a research program. Francken, Slors, and
Craver (2022) add to this co-evolutionary process a consideration of
the experimental methods for testing capacities and activities at
different levels of organization. We face a large hermeneutic circle
precisely because, in the final analysis, the mechanism must contain
all and only the relevant components in the phenomenon.</p>

<p>
Some disagreement here appears to be verbal, about whether the
above-discussed intrusions of perspectivism into one&rsquo;s account
of mechanisms is sufficient to defile any claim to realism. Others may
insist that the degree of objective constraint on kinds of mechanism,
their boundaries, and their components, is sufficient to warrant, at
least in many cases, a stronger commitment to a world that comes, in
some sense, packaged into mechanisms. This brings us to the second
interesting possible difference among mechanists: just how messy they
think the &ldquo;blooming, buzzing confusion&rdquo; of the causal
structure of the world is.</p>

<p>
In early work, Glennan makes claims like: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
These mechanisms are systems consisting of stable arrangements of
parts. In virtue of these arrangements, the systems as a whole have
stable dispositions&mdash;the behaviors of these mechanisms. (Glennan
2002: S345) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This might suggest that Glennan (2002) has stronger faith in a certain
causal stability in the world than Francken, Slors, and Craver (2022).
Compare more recent work by Glennan and Illari (2017a), though.
Following their acknowledgment that mechanism tokens don&rsquo;t sort
neatly into kinds, they continue, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
However, the fact that there are many ways to carve up the world does
not mean that there isn&rsquo;t a world out there that constrains and
makes sense of our carvings. We think our account is consistent with
what Mitchell calls a &ldquo;pluralist realist approach to ontology,
which suggests not that there are multiple worlds, but that there are
multiple correct ways to parse our world&rdquo;. (Glennan &amp; Illari
2017a: 99; quoting Mitchell 2009: 13) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea of multiple correct ways might accord a slightly lesser role
to scientists&rsquo; interests than Craver does, but this does seem to
be a form of perspectival realism in the tradition of Giere
(2006).</p>

<p>
Bechtel contrasts with Glennan as he considers scientists&rsquo;
interests, and their cognitive and other epistemic capacities, as
paramount, making claims such as, &ldquo;Explanation is fundamentally
an epistemic activity performed by scientists&rdquo; (Bechtel 2008:
18), and, with Cory Wright, &ldquo;explaining refers to a
ratiocinative practice governed by certain norms&rdquo; (C. Wright
&amp; Bechtel 2007: 51).</p>

<p>
Craver, Glennan, and Illari are keen to emphasize that the choices
that scientists make are not arbitrary, but instead are strongly
constrained by empirical work, emphasizing the engagement with the
world that goes into mechanism discovery. Bechtel of course does not
think scientists&rsquo; choices are arbitrary, and he is very
interested in empirical work. However, he is particularly interested
in the constraints that scientists&rsquo; cognitive and other
epistemic capacities impose on mechanism discovery, and this naturally
makes him cautious about mechanism realism. So it seems that for
Bechtel, scientists&rsquo; (and human cognitive) capacities dominate
in the story of characterizing and recharacterizing the phenomenon,
and deciding on parts, boundaries and kinds of mechanisms. But note
that this is perfectly consistent with a broad perspectival realism
that simply takes the causal structure of the world to be
significantly more messy, and therefore less able to determine all
these choices, than Glennan (2002), and possibly even Francken, Slors,
and Craver (2022), seem to think.</p>

<p>
Ultimately, then, a perspectival realism broadly captures a range of
key views in the mechanisms literature, that form at least a kind of
default view, albeit one that can be adopted, or rejected (see Buzzoni
(2016) for critical discussion). Key mechanists who disagree still
share quite a lot of substantive agreement, and their disagreements
are not entirely clear, but are quite nuanced, and take significant
interpretation of their work.</p>

<h2 id="HowDoDiffScieDiscRelaOneAnot">6. How Do Different Scientific Disciplines Relate to One Another?</h2>

<p>
Historically, the term &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; has been associated
with explanatory reductionism, in which the behavior of the whole is
explained in terms of the organization and activities of the parts. In
contemporary philosophy, however, the idea of mechanism has tended
rather to be associated with forms of explanatory and integrative
anti-reductionism and, for some, metaphysical antireductionism as well
(see
 <a href="#WhyDoesSoMuchSciePracRevoArouMechExpl">Section 3</a>).
 These anti-reductionist sentiments have at the core the idea that
mechanisms and mechanistic explanations typically span multiple levels
of organization, as introduced in
 <a href="#Leve">Section 2.1.5</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ExplRedu">6.1 Explanatory Reductionism</h3>

<p>
According to the CL model of explanation (e.g., Hempel 1965),
reductive explanations involve explaining a derivative law in terms of
more fundamental laws. In schematic form, such explanations involve
identifying the kind-terms of the higher-level laws with kind terms
from the lower-level laws (using &ldquo;bridge laws&rdquo;) and
showing the higher-level laws to be a deductive consequence of the
lower-level laws (see Schaffner 1993 for its fullest development; see
the SEP entry on
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/">Scientific Reduction</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Mechanists argued that this model is too demanding in some respects
and too lax in others. It is too demanding, first, in its reliance on
the idea of &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo;, which many have argued are
scarce in the special sciences, perhaps because such language is inapt
for describing a world with variation, equifinality, and frailty
(Beatty 1995; Mitchell 1997, 2000; Woodward 2003). It is too
demanding, second, in requiring that the explanation be an argument.
Few if any actual interlevel explanations can be spelled out as
arguments, and, in actual science, considerable refinement and
restriction are required to bring the two sets of laws into sufficient
alignment to allow anything like a derivation to go through. Even
advocates of the CL model of reduction (e.g., Schaffner 1993;
Churchland 1986) argued for this reason that reduction is
&ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; to explanations in scientific practice, at
best a regulative ideal or, worse, a mopping-up exercise to be
performed after the difficult work of building the lower-level
explanation is complete. </p>

<p>
Others argued that the CL model of downward-looking explanations is
too lax to capture the norms scientists seem to enforce in evaluating
explanations. In failing to mark adequately the difference between
accidental regularities and causes, the constraints on the CL model of
reduction admit explanations involving mere correlations and causally
irrelevant generalizations. They also admit explanations that involve
only non-explanatory re-descriptions.</p>

<p>
The mechanistic alternative is that downward-looking explanations
provide information about the parts and activities underlying the
explanandum phenomenon. This view of downward-looking explanation
eschews the law requirement and the argument requirement in the CL
model. It is designed instead to reflect the goals of explanation as
revealed in the investigative practices of scientists (see Craver
2007a).</p>

<p>
Finally, new mechanists almost universally defend talk of causes and
explanations at higher levels of organization as scientifically
legitimate and necessary (see, e.g., Craver 2007a; Glennan 2010; 2017;
Krickel 2018 a,b). Specifically, they argue that there are true
difference-making relations at higher levels that are not true of the
relations among component parts. Glennan argues that these truths hold
in virtue of lower-level mechanisms. </p>

<h3 id="OntoRedu">6.2 Ontological Reductionism</h3>

<p>
It is not universally agreed that one can separate issues of
explanatory reduction from issues of ontological reduction. Salmon
(1989) advocated for an ontic view of explanation, and it has been
endorsed by many champions of causal (e.g., Strevens 2008, 2013),
mechanistic (e.g., Craver 2007a; Hochstein 2016), and counterfactual
(Povich 2017) explanation. On that view, the aim is to characterize
the ontological referent of explanatory texts and models. Others (such
as Bechtel &amp; Abrahamsen 2005), think that norms of explanator
texts, such as intelligibility, should drive one&rsquo;s ontological
commitments.</p>

<p>
One tradition of broadly mechanistic thought (including thinkers such
as Simon 1969; Cummins 1983; Lycan 1990) has argued that the
organization of parts gives rise to higher-level phenomena that are
quite literally more than simple sums of their parts. Wimsatt, for
example, distinguishes aggregates, simple sums of the properties of
type identical components (as the mass of a pile of sand is a sum of
the masses of the individual grains), from systems in which the
organization of the components matters. In aggregates, as opposed to
systems, the parts can be intersubstituted for one another without
changing the property of the whole; they can be disaggregated and
reaggregated, restoring the property of the whole; the parts do not
interact with one another in a way that is relevant to the property of
the whole; and the spatial and temporal organization of the parts is
irrelevant to the property of the whole. These things are all false
for systems (non-aggregates), explaining why they have properties that
are, literally, more than a simple sum of the parts (see by Bechtel
2013; Craver 2007a). (Note that Kim 1998, a prominent critic of
non-reductive physicalism, describes this point as both obvious and
important for understanding the structure of the world.)</p>

<p>
If higher-level capacities and causings are (token- or type-)
identified with their lower-level realizers, the mechanistic defense
of higher-level causings is arguably a form of reductive functionalism
(Polger 2004, 2010). In a series of articles, Gillett (2002a,b,c),
Melnyk (2003), and Piccinini and Craver (2011) argue that mechanistic
reduction is compatible with realism about higher-level causes and
indeed an important part of their legitimacy as higher level causes
(see, for examples, the contributors to the metaphysical sections of
Schouten and Looren de Jong&rsquo;s (2007; See Piccinini (2020) for a
more recent exploration of these issues. </p>

<p>
Some have offered mechanistic accounts of the nature of the
constitution relation. Harbecke (2015) defends a regularity theory of
constitution, for example, and shows that many of the norms for
evaluating mechanistic explanation make sense in light of that notion.
Carl Gillett (2002a,b) distinguishes dimensioned and flat views of the
realization relation, noting that the former involves the realization
of properties of wholes by properties of the parts, of which
mechanistic realization is a species (though see Polger 2010 for a
response and Couch 2023 for further development).</p>

<p>
Discussions of the legitimacy of higher-level causes (including
debates about the causal closure of the physical and causal
overdetermination) often turn on metaphysical commitments that vary
considerably among not just philosophers but mechanists specifically.
Some mechanists emphasize the explanatory power of only cellular and
molecular phenomena (e.g., Bickle 2003, 2020) and defend a world of
lowest-level causes. Others, such as Craver, Bechtel (2008), Glennan
(2010), and Gillett (2002c), defend a world of higher-level
causes.</p>

<h4 id="MechReduEmer">6.2.1 Mechanism, Reduction, and Emergence</h4>

<p>
The relationship between mechanism and emergence is hard to specify,
given varying definitions of emergence (see the entry on
 <a href="../properties-emergent/">emergence</a>)
 and varying metaphysical commitments among mechanists. Yet a few
remarks are in order. (See Gillett 2002b for a useful review.)</p>

<p>
First, for many people, emergence is defined by the whole being more
than the sum of its parts. Because mechanisms are non-aggregative, all
of them exhibit emergence in this weak sense. <em>Mechanistic (or
organizational) emergence</em> thus understood is ubiquitous and
extremely important for understanding both how scientists explain
things and how the domains of the special sciences are related to one
another.</p>

<p>
Also familiar and uncontroversial is <em>epistemic emergence</em>, the
inability to predict the properties or behaviors of wholes from
properties and behaviors of the parts. Epistemic emergence can arise
as a result of ignorance, such as failing to recognize a relevant
variable, or from failing to know how different variables interact in
complex networks. It might also result from limitations on human
cognitive abilities or in current-generation representational tools
(Bedau 1997; Boogerd, Bruggeman, Richardson, et al. 2005; Richardson
&amp; Stephan 2007). The practical necessity of studying mechanisms by
decomposing them into component parts raises the epistemic challenge
of putting the parts back together again in a way that actually works
(Bechtel 2013); epistemic emergence might stand in the way.</p>

<p>
Mechanistic emergence and epistemic emergence contrast with spooky
emergence (Richardson &amp; Stephan 2007), cases in which new
properties exist with no sufficient basis in constitutive mechanisms.
It is not clear that emergent properties in this sense are properly
said to be properties <em>of the mechanisms</em> at all; and it is not
clear in what sense the emergent property is &ldquo;emergent&rdquo;
rather than simply an effect of a cause. Spooky emergence is often
conjoined with thoughts of top-down and bottom-up causation, ideas
that are hard to square with mechanistic notions of levels (see
section 3.4.2) and that are, in fact, mundane and unexciting when
applied to, e.g., levels of size or levels of scientific fields. In
short, such forms of spooky emergence are altogether distinct from,
and so gain no plausibility from, verbal association with,
organizational/mechanistic and epistemic emergence.</p>

<h4 id="MechReal_1">6.2.2 Mechanism and Realization</h4>

<p>
Many philosophers now believe that the requirement of type-identity
built into the classical model of reduction does not accommodate
ordinary cases in which higher-level capacities and properties are
multiply realized in their lower-level realizers. What is the idea of
mechanistic realization?</p>

<p>
Some scholars have found the notion of mechanism helpful as a way of
fleshing out the ontological relationship of (a kind of) realization.
One important distinction is between flat and dimensioned views of
realization: According to the &ldquo;flat view&rdquo; (Gillett 2002a
and 2002b), realization is a relationship between different properties
of one and the same thing (Kim 1998). The subset view, which holds
that a property P1 (e.g., mean kinetic energy of the gas) realizes
property P2 (e.g., temperature of the gas) when the causal powers
distinctive of P2 (temperature) are a subset of the causal powers
distinctive of P2 (mean kinetic energy), is an example of the flat
view. P1 and P2 are both attributed to the same thing, the gas
(Gillett 2002a,b). The dimensioned view describes realization as a
relationship holding between the properties of wholes and the
properties of the parts and their organization. This view of
realization comports with the explanatory aims of the special sciences
and fits nicely with the evidential base on which interlevel claims
are grounded (see Aizawa &amp; Gillett 2009. Gillett has since
expanded this notion to handle the realization of objects, properties,
and processes (Gillett 2013); for criticism and alternatives, see
Polger 2010; Melnyk 2003, 2010).</p>

<h3 id="InteInteIntePlur">6.3 Interfield integration and Integrative Pluralism</h3>

<p>
What does mechanism add to discussions about the unity of science that
fueled discussions of reductionism in the philosophy of science? If
one rejects a tidy correspondence between levels, theories, and fields
of science (as mechanists are apt to do; see Darden 2006; Craver
2007a; Craver &amp; Darden 2013), and replaces it with only a set of
local, multilevel structures framed by reference to a top-most
explanandum phenomenon, an alternative picture of scientific
integration emerges.</p>

<p>
On the mechanistic account, integration is not a relationship between
theories but a relationship within single mechanistic theories (Darden
&amp; Maull 1977). And these theories are not merely abstract, formal
structures composed of logical relations; instead they are further
structured by material relations such as causation, part-and-whole,
spatial containment, temporal succession, and geometric arrangement.
These material commitments allow one to provide an account of levels
and to highlight the kinds of evidence by which interfield
integrations are evaluated. Furthermore, while classical reduction is
exclusively focused on downward-looking explanations, the effort to
build multilevel mechanistic explanations requires one to look outward
and upward as well to see how phenomena at many different levels are
related to one another (Bechtel 2009; Craver 2007a).</p>

<p>
The abstract structure of a multilevel mechanism introduced in
 <a href="#Leve">Section 2.1.5</a>
 becomes a scaffold onto and around which the findings of diverse
fields can converge in the service of building a mechanistic
explanation (see Bechtel 1988; Craver 2005; Glennan 2017) or, perhaps
more appropriately, a cluster of overlapping and related mechanistic
explanations (e.g., wild type and mutant; healthy and diseased) (see
Darden 2006; Spring &amp; Illari 2019). Case-studies in such
mechanistic integration include Darden&rsquo;s (2005) extended
discussion of the relation between Mendelian and molecular genetics,
Bechtel&rsquo;s (2006) studies of cell biology and fermentation,
Bechtel and Richardson&rsquo;s (1993) exploration of localization of
function in neuroscience and cell biology, Craver&rsquo;s studies of
the action potential and the neurobiology of learning and memory
(2005; 2007), and Ylikoski&rsquo;s studies with colleagues of
mechanistic explanations in the social sciences (Hedstrom &amp;
Ylikoski 2011; Ylikoski 2017).</p>

<p>
The mechanistic perspective exhibits the kind of integrative pluralism
Mitchell (2003, 2009) advocates for the special sciences. The
construction of mechanistic explanations is collaborative and
piecemeal, adding incremental constraints to an developing picture of
how a mechanism works at a level and across levels, as well as at a
time and across times (Craver &amp; Darden 2013). The many scientific
disciplines that investigate a phenomenon co-exist and co-inform one
another by integratively contributing constraints upon the
etiological, constitutive, and contextual mechanistic explanations of
that phenomenon (Bechtel 2009; Tabery 2014).</p>

<p>
Although some mechanists have tended to emphasize the locality of such
integrations as occurring within the search for a particular
explanation, mechanistic integration across a cluster of related
mechanisms (Darden 2006; Illari 2019) might offer a kind of wide-scope
unity, expanding beyond the confines of any particular mechanism to
provide quite general explanations types of phenomena.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The past two decades have seen truly explosive growth in the
recognition of the centrality of mechanisms to our contemporary
conception of science. The term, however, continues to function as an
organizational concept onto which our greatest hopes and fears of
science can be projected. It is the object of our collective quest,
the wellspring of translational knowledge and understanding. At the
same time, it embodies our deepest assumptions about the nature of
explanation, the aims of science, the constraints on acceptable
solutions to scientific problems. it is therefore a lightning rod for
dispute over what science ought to be, what it ought to aim to
achieve, and how it most efficiently can achieve that. Philosophical
reflection on mechanism arose in response to the need to engage that
discussion in a language appropriate to the practice of science. And
now that it has been said, it is difficult indeed to think about
science without thinking about mechanisms.</p>
