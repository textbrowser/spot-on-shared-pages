<div id="preamble">

<p>
Buddhism was introduced to the Korean Peninsula from China in the 4th
century during the Korean Three Kingdoms period. It first arrived in
Kogury&#335;, a kingdom on the peninsula&rsquo;s northern end, and then
reached Paekche, a kingdom on the southwest of the peninsula. It
arrived in Silla, a kingdom on the southeast of the peninsula,
through Kogury&#335;. Although the Buddhism that first took root in
Korea was largely Sinicized Buddhism, it evolved into a uniquely
Korean tradition, developing its own distinctive historical, cultural,
and social context.</p>

<p>
Throughout history, Buddhism has significantly influenced the
worldview of the Korean people, instilling concepts such as karma and
the interconnectedness of all things. Korean Buddhist philosophers
place an emphasis on cultivating the power of the mind, underpinning
their teachings with the belief that the mind of every individual is
inherently the Buddha&rsquo;s mind. Nevertheless, their narratives
vary when addressing the dynamic tension between aristocratic and
populist Buddhism, the quest for personal enlightenment versus the
salvation of others, and the dichotomy of doctrinal study and
meditation practice.</p>

<h2 id="IntBudTeaKor">1. Introduction of Buddhist teachings to Korea</h2>

<p>
When Buddhism reached the Korean Peninsula, it encountered a spiritual
landscape dominated by indigenous shamanic religions. The first major
Buddhist teachings introduced in Korea included the theory of karma
and the political ideas of Buddhism (Ko: 30&ndash;37). These core
concepts resonated with the Korean people, leading Buddhism to soon
supplant the previous spiritual systems.</p>

<h3 id="TheKar">1.1 The Theory of Karma</h3>

<p>
Karma, one of the most well-known Buddhist concepts in the Western
world, literally means &ldquo;action.&rdquo; It encompasses both the
act itself and its consequences, and has developed into an ethical
principle of cause and effect. In Buddhism, karma is defined
specifically as intentional action, placing emphasis on human agency
and moral choice within the karmic process.</p>

<p>
The theory of karma introduced the concept of transmigration. Before
the arrival of Buddhism, it was commonly believed that the realms of
the living and the dead were distinct and physically separated. Beings
from one realm could exert spiritual influence over the other,
especially among family members. Ancestors&rsquo; spirits were thought
to be able to help or harm their descendants in the world of the
living, and descendants were believed to be capable of aiding their
ancestors in resting peacefully in the realm of the dead. When a
person dies, the spirit permanently departs the world of the living,
with no rebirth, it was believed. However, Buddhism introduced the
idea of past and future lives through the process of rebirth,
proposing that individuals are continuously reborn into circumstances
determined by their past lives. Thus, the concept of karma provided
the Korean people with a logical explanation for why they should
engage in ethical behavior.</p>

<h3 id="PolIdeBud">1.2 Political Ideas of Buddhism</h3>

<p>
The Korean ruling class embraced Buddhism because it provided advanced
knowledge and ideas to fortify the concept of kingship. Specifically,
during Silla&rsquo;s transition from tribal coalitions to a
centralized kingdom, King Chinh&#365;ng leveraged the concept of
<em>Chakravarti</em> to reinforce his kingship (Ko:44&ndash;48; Jeong:97).
<em>Chakravarti</em> is the title of an ideal king in Buddhism, ruling
by truth rather than force. This term implies a king who turns the
wheel of truth, symbolizing limitless governing power. The
king&rsquo;s vast governing power is depicted through the rolling
wheel on his castle. His right to rule, earned through good karma in
his past life, is indestructible. Under his reign, peace and justice
are assured for all. For instance, if he were to go to war, he would
achieve a bloodless victory as the enemy would surrender upon seeing
the aura of the wheel leading the army.</p>

<p>
The <em>Chakravarti</em> concept supported the appointment of a king
over a tribal coalition to ensure stability. Furthermore, the people
equated a king with Maitreya, the world&rsquo;s savior Buddha.
Buddhism was perceived as more rational and potent than indigenous
belief systems, enabling Buddhist kings to make shamans and political
rivals submit to their authority more easily. Such political thoughts
significantly strengthened the kingship and centralized governments in
the three kingdoms.</p>

<h2 id="FloBudPhi">2. The Flourishing of Buddhist Philosophy</h2>

<p>
As Buddhism took root in Korea, it was perceived as a progressive
moral and intellectual framework and swiftly adopted by the
Korean people. This adoption led to a more widespread belief in
Buddhism and deepened the study of Buddhist scriptures. In particular,
the scriptures from the M&#257;dhyamaka, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, and
precepts schools gained significant traction. Numerous theoretical
schools such as Sanlun, Shelun, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, and Niepan were
explored extensively (Huh 2005: 7). While Sanlun was a major stream in
Kogury&#335;, and Baekche, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School was the
primary Buddhist school in Silla (Ko 1989:138). However, towards the
late Unified Silla period (780&ndash;935CE), Huayan (K.
<em>Hwa&#335;m</em>) School eventually became the most influential
branch of Korean Buddhism.</p>

<h3 id="ImpYogSch">2.1 The Impact of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School</h3>

<p>
The Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School, a major philosophical branch of
Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhism, proposes that all phenomena are
manifestations of consciousness. With that assumption, the school
focuses on the investigation of the workings of human consciousness,
the nature of the afflictions of the human mind, and how tainted
consciousness can return to its original, untainted state. According
to Yog&#257;c&#257;ra teachings, human consciousness exists at eight
levels: the first five correspond to the senses, the sixth to the
mind, the seventh to self-consciousness that creates the belief of
self from stored consciousness, and the eighth to the storehouse
consciousness preserving the seeds of karma. Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
practice aims to purify all levels of consciousness, transforming
deluded consciousness into wisdom.</p>

<p>
Among the well-known Korean Yog&#257;c&#257;ra scholars of this period
was W&#335;n&rsquo;gwang (&#22291;&#20809;, 542&ndash;640 CE), a
Silla monk, who studied Shelun philosophy in China before teaching it
in Silla. His teachings emphasized the pure Buddha mind, urging
followers of Mah&#257;y&#257;na teachings to primarily practice faith
and understanding of the one real realm, their true mind,
characterized by purity, non-obstruction, and permanence. This one
real realm is referred to as the womb of Buddha
(<em>Y&#335;raejang</em> &#22914;&#20358;&#34255;; Skt.
<em>Tath&#257;gatagarbha</em>) or the ninth consciousness.</p>

<p>
W&#335;n&rsquo;gwang&rsquo;s nine consciousness concept was influenced
by Zhendi (&#30494;&#35558;, 499&ndash;569 CE), a key translator and
scholar in the Shelun School. Zhendi introduced the concept of a
ninth, pure consciousness, a belief rooted in the Buddha nature
theory. He believed that the tainted eighth consciousness and the
purified consciousness were essentially different, meaning they should
be separately named. Though Zhendi&rsquo;s nine consciousness theory
was well received at that time, the idea of pure, untainted
consciousness existing prior to enlightenment remained a point of
contention between the Dilun and Shelun schools.</p>

<p>
Later, Xuanzang (602&ndash;664 CE), the famed Chinese monk-scholar,
introduced new translations of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra scriptures from
India. These works led to the eight consciousness theory being
established as the orthodox view within the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra school
in China. Xuanzang acknowledged the possibility of an untainted seed
existing in latent form within the eighth consciousness but did not
accept the existence of a separate, ninth consciousness. He also
recognized the existence of beings known as <em>icchantikas</em>, who
entirely lack the capacity for such purity. As a result, Xuanzang
proposed a theory of five classes of sentient beings, each with
differing capacities for salvation, based on the quality of their
untainted seeds. This marked a significant departure from
Zhendi&rsquo;s doctrine of universal salvation through inherent
Buddha-nature.</p>

<p>
The Shilla monk W&#335;nch&#365;k (&#22291;&#28204;, 613&ndash;696
CE), who studied in China, engaged with both interpretations of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra thought and tried to reconcile them. While adhering
primarily to Xuanzang&rsquo;s eight consciousnesses model,
W&#335;nch&#365;k incorporated the concept of pure consciousness,
situating it within the eighth consciousness rather than outside of
it. This view suggests the eighth consciousness is not entirely
tainted as it does contain pure elements. Despite being a follower of
Xunzang&rsquo;s revised Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines,
W&#335;nch&#365;k upheld the belief that all sentient beings possess
the potential to attain Buddhahood.</p>

<p>
Renowned monks from Shilla, such as &#364;isang (&#32681;&#28248;,
625&ndash;702 CE) and W&#335;nhyo (&#20803;&#26313;, 617&ndash;686
CE), studied the teachings of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School. They
sought to travel to China to learn from the famous monk Xuanzang.
W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s story of enlightenment, which occurred en route to
China, illustrates the significant influence Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
teachings had on him. When &#364;isang and W&#335;nhyo reached a
harbor to embark on their journey to China, they were caught in a
sudden downpour and sought refuge in a small cave. During the night,
W&#335;nhyo woke up feeling extremely thirsty. In the darkness, he
found a bowl of water nearby, drank from it, and felt a sense of
satisfaction. However, come daylight, he realized he had drunk fetid
water from a skull, which caused him to vomit. This experience led
W&#335;nhyo to question why the same water had tasted satisfactory at
night but made him sick in the morning when he realized its true
nature. He concluded that the water was the same, but his mind had
distinguished it as clean at night and dirty in the morning. This
realization&mdash;that everything is a creation of the
mind&mdash;prompted him to stay in Shilla, having experienced the
essential teaching of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra.</p>

<h3 id="IsaHwaPhi">2.2 &#364;isang&rsquo;s Hwa&#335;m Philosophy</h3>

<p>
&#364;isang is credited with founding the Korean Hwa&#335;m school and
transmitting Hwa&#335;m philosophy&mdash;rooted in the <em>Flower
Garland S&#363;tra</em> (<em>Avata&#7747;saka
S&#363;tra</em>)&mdash;to the Korean peninsula. He focused on the core
tenets of Hwa&#335;m thought, particularly the concept of
&ldquo;dependent arising of the universe&rdquo; (<em>Fajie
yuanqi</em>, &#27861;&#30028;&#32227;&#36215;), through which he
articulated a vision of radical interdependence and emphasized the
principle of equality both theoretically and in lived practice.</p>

<p>
&#364;isang studied in China under Zhiyan (602&ndash;668), the second
patriarch of the Huayan school, rather than with Xuanzang. During this
period, he composed the &ldquo;Diagram of the Dharma Realm of the
One-Vehicle of the Avata&#7747;saka&rdquo; (<em>Hwa&#335;m ils&#365;ng
p&#335;pkyeto</em>,
&#33775;&#22196;&#19968;&#20056;&#27861;&#30028;&#22294;), which
encapsulates the essence of his Hwa&#335;m philosophy. The diagram
contains a distinctive shape, consisting of only 210 sinograms
intricately arranged, symbolizing a mandala. This unusual shape
bestowed an esoteric and magical quality upon the words, enhancing
their effect.</p>

<p>
&#364;isang&rsquo;s diagram opens with a description of original
nature and presents two key teachings: &ldquo;dependent arising from
original nature&rdquo; (<em>Xingqi</em>, &#24615;&#36215;) and
&ldquo;dependent arising of the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p1">
&ldquo;The dharma nature is perfectly interfused, not possessing the
characteristic of duality;</p>

<p class="p1">
All dharmas are unmoving; they are originally quiescent.</p>

<p class="p1">
They have no names and characteristics; all distinctions are
severed.</p>

<p class="p1">
It is known through the wisdom of realization and not by any other
means.</p>

<p class="p1">
True nature is very deep and supremely fine and profound.</p>

<p class="p1">
It is not attached to self-nature and is achieved in accordance with
conditions&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p1">
(McBride 2012a: 103&ndash;104)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage articulates the totality, tranquility, and ineffability
of untainted original nature (dharma nature). While &ldquo;true
nature&rdquo; is often used to refer to the original nature of the human
mind, it functions in relation to other phenomena and conditions.
&#364;isang&rsquo;s formulation echoes the famous line from the
<em>Flower Garland S&#363;tra</em>: &ldquo;All originates from the
mind. The mind is the world&rsquo;s painter.&rdquo; This exemplifies
the theory of dependent arising from original nature&mdash;the idea
that all phenomena arise from a hidden but present Buddha nature
within the mind. Though obscured by ignorance, this inner Buddha
nature shapes reality and underpins the view that the mind holds the
power to transform the world, a concept foundational to Korean
Buddhism.</p>

<p>
From this point, the diagram transitions to &ldquo;dependent arising
of the universe&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p1">
&ldquo;Within one, there is all, and within many, there is one.</p>

<p class="p1">
The one is precisely all, and the many are precisely the one.</p>

<p class="p1">
A minute particle of dust contains the ten directions;</p>

<p class="p1">
All particles of dust are also like this.</p>

<p class="p1">
The immeasurably distant kalpa is precisely a single
thought-moment,</p>

<p class="p1">
A single thought-moment is precisely an immeasurably distant
kalpa.</p>

<p class="p1">
The nine time periods and the ten time periods are mutually
identical;</p>

<p class="p1">
They are not in confusion, but have been formed separately.</p>

<p>
When one initially arouses the aspiration to enlightenment is
precisely complete enlightenment.</p>

<p>
Sams&#257;ra and nirv&#257;na are always in harmony.&rdquo;(McBride
2012a: 104&ndash;105)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This teaching expands the traditional Buddhist concept of dependent
origination to a cosmic scale. While early Buddhist formulations
explained causality among individual phenomena, Hwa&#335;m thought
developed a more holistic vision: each being is both a microcosm of
the universe and contains the entirety of the cosmos within itself.
This idea is succinctly captured in the phrase &ldquo;one is all, all
is one.&rdquo; The diagram&rsquo;s poetic illustrations&mdash;such as
&ldquo;one dust&rdquo; or &ldquo;a single
thought-moment&rdquo;-reflect this profound interpenetration, where no
absolute distinctions exist between parts and whole, individual and
totality.</p>

<p>
&#364;isang interpreted this vision as a radical form of equality. He
sought to embody this ideal in his monastic community, despite the
rigid social hierarchy of the Shilla period. Notably, he accepted
students from all social backgrounds and treated them equally,
striving to build a community that reflected the harmony and
interdependence revealed in Hwa&#335;m thought.</p>

<p>
Modern Korean scholars interpret &ldquo;one is all, and all is
one&rdquo; in two ways (Kim 1990: 216&ndash;218). In the 1970s,
historians proposed that this concept served to bolster the kingship
of the Shilla king. They saw the relationship between the king and his
subjects as analogous to the interconnectedness of the one, and all
individual beings. In contrast, from the 1980s onward, Buddhist
scholars began interpreting this concept as an expression of the
inherent equality of all beings. They reasoned that the relationship
between the one and all inherently implies equality; this equilibrium
can only be sustained when all elements within the relationship are
balanced, which in turn requires that each being be considered equal.
Both groups also concurred that the principle of dependent arising of
the universe played a significant role in unifying people. This core
Hwa&#335;m philosophy has profoundly influenced the Korean mindset,
instilling the belief in the interconnected and interdependent nature
of existence (Jee 2022).</p>

<p>
&#364;isang&rsquo;s diagram offers a vision of the world seen from the
enlightened perspective, encouraging readers to engage in practice
toward that goal. When the mind returns to its original nature, it
ceases to make distinctions, transcends duality, relinquishes
attachment to a separate self, and moves freely according to the law
of dependent arising. The enlightened person, fully awakened to this
nature, perceives unity even among opposites, sees the entire universe
in a speck of dust, and experiences boundless time in a single moment.
&#364;isang concludes his diagram with the following line:</p>

<p>
Finally, seated on the throne of the Middle Way, Ultimate
Reality. From times long past he has not moved-hence his name is
Buddha. (McBride 2012a: 105)</p>

<p>
&#364;isang thus affirms that all beings are manifestations of the
Buddha and possess the innate capacity to realize Buddhahood.</p>

<h3 id="WnhPhi">2.3 W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s Philosophy</h3>

<p>
W&#335;nhyo is widely regarded as the most prominent philosopher in
Korean Buddhism. A master of Buddhist logic, he engaged deeply with a
wide range of texts, including the treatises of the M&#257;dhyamaka,
Sanlun, and Yog&#257;c&#257;ra schools, as well as major scriptures
such as the <em>Lotus S&#363;tra</em>, the <em>Flower Garland
S&#363;tra</em>, and the <em>Larger S&#363;tra of Amitabha,</em> among
others. He is credited with writing 70 works in 150 volumes, of which
20 works in 22 volumes are extant today. His commentaries on the
<em>Awakening of Faith in the</em> Mah&#257;y&#257;na were highly
influential, impacting later thinkers such as Fazang and Zongmi.</p>

<p>
Although he initially planned to study under Xuanzang in China,
W&#335;nhyo ultimately chose to remain in Silla. There, he
independently studied Xuanzang&rsquo;s Yog&#257;c&#257;ra teachings
and developed a critical response to them. Drawing from a wide range
of Buddhist doctrines, W&#335;nhyo established his own One Mind
philosophy and advanced the concept of <em>Hwajaeng</em> (reconciling
Buddhist doctrines). For his contributions, he became known as the
&ldquo;State preceptor of <em>Hwajaeng</em>&rdquo; and was even
considered by some to be the reincarnation of Dign&#257;ga, given his
mastery of Buddhist logic. His philosophical foundation was rooted in
the <em>Awakening of Faith in the Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em></p>

<h3 id="ForOneMinPhi">2.3.1. Formation of the One Mind Philosophy</h3>

<p>
W&#335;nhyo engaged with Xuanzang&rsquo;s philosophy in two major
ways. First, he critiqued Xuanzang&rsquo;s logical inferences,
pointing out fallacies in their structure (Kim 2022: 269). Second, he
raised several questions regarding Xuanzang&rsquo;s
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra: Can every being achieve enlightenment? Do the
teachings of the M&#257;dhyamaka School or the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
School hold more accuracy? Is the One Mind a vessel of purity,
impurity, or a composite of both?</p>

<p>
W&#335;nhyo addressed these questions through his study of the
<em>Awakening of Faith in the Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em>, one of the most
influential texts in East Asian Buddhism. This scripture elaborates on
the Tath&#257;gatagarbha doctrine and introduces the concept of
<em>One Mind</em> (Ch. <em>yixin</em>, K. <em>ilsim</em>,
&#19968;&#24515;).</p>

<p>
In response to the first question, W&#335;nhyo argued that all beings
can achieve enlightenment because the One Mind contains pure
Buddha-nature, although he acknowledged the possibility of rare
exceptions. Regarding the second question, he reconciled the teachings
of the <em>M&#257;dhyamaka</em> and <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;ra</em>
schools, asserting that both were valid expressions of the two aspects
of One Mind. The <em>suchness</em> (&#30495;&#22914;) aspect
corresponds to <em>M&#257;dhyamaka</em>&rsquo;s emphasis on emptiness
as the original nature, while the <em>arising and ceasing</em>
(&#29983;&#28357;) aspect aligns with
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;ra</em>&rsquo;s focus on the storehouse
consciousness arising through causes and conditions.</p>

<p>
In response to the third question, W&#335;nhyo posited that the One
Mind is inherently pure and ultimately beyond linguistic
categorization. However, it can be provisionally described as a
mixture of the tainted and the untainted. Drawing from the
<em>Awakening of Faith</em>, he interpreted the One Mind as a unifying
framework for understanding the human mind. The One Mind encompasses
all terminologies related to original nature and is identified with
the minds of sentient beings. It is characterized by two
aspects&mdash;suchness and arising/ceasing&mdash;and by the
&ldquo;three greatnesses&rdquo; (K. <em>samdae</em>,
&#19977;&#22823;), which refer to its essence, attributes, and
functions.</p>

<p>
This comprehensive interpretation offers a holistic perspective on the
mind and consciousness within Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhism.
W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s responses to the above questions laid the
groundwork for his One Mind philosophy, named to reflect the depth of
its unifying insight. &ldquo;One&rdquo; refers to its transcendence of
dualities and its ability to harmonize diverse teachings without
contradiction. &ldquo;Mind&rdquo; refers to its ineffable, intelligent
nature (T1844, 206c&ndash;207a). All beings originate from the One
Mind and ultimately return to it, making it the source and destination
of all phenomena.</p>

<p>
W&#335;nhyo also systematized related Buddhist terms under this
framework. He classified <em>suchness</em> and the <em>true
nature</em> of all beings under the aspect of suchness, while placing
concepts like <em>Buddha-nature</em>, <em>storehouse
consciousness</em>, the <em>ninth consciousness</em>, and the
<em>Buddha&rsquo;s womb</em> under the aspect of arising and ceasing
(T1845, 227c).</p>

<p>
In W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s One Mind philosophy, enlightenment is,
therefore, the act of returning to the One Mind. This can be achieved
through the practice of the six paramitas&mdash;generosity,
discipline, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and
wisdom&mdash;or by chanting to Amit&#257;bha with faith in the One
Mind and the three Buddhist treasures: the Buddha, his teachings, and
the Buddhist practitioners. To help more people return to the One
Mind, W&#335;nhyo suggested a practice of reciting the name of
Amit&#257;bha, particularly for the illiterate population. He wandered
through towns, reciting &ldquo;Namu Amitabul&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;I
take refuge in Amit&#257;bha&rdquo;) while tapping a wooden singing
ball. The philosophy of the One Mind acknowledges the coexistence of
the pure and impure minds within the One Mind. This insight
underscores the duality of the human mind, containing both pure and
impure aspects, and highlights the need for its cultivation.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, W&#335;nhyo utilized the concept of the One Mind as a
foundational principle for harmony and reconciliation, from which he
developed his unique theory of reconciliation, known as
&ldquo;<em>Hwajaeng&rdquo;.</em></p>

<h3 id="RecBudDoc">2.3.2. Reconciling Buddhist Doctrines</h3>

<p>
Another well-known concept of W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s Buddhist philosophy
is reconciling Buddhist doctrines (<em>hwajaeng</em>,
&#21644;&#35533;), which has had a lasting impact on Korean Buddhism.
Scholars have argued that <em>hwajaeng</em> was not only a model for
understanding Buddhist teaching more inclusively, but also
W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s response to societal division and conflict. He
seeks to harmonize disputes within Buddhist doctrine, using key
premises from the M&#257;dhyamaka School and the <em>Lotus
s&#363;tra</em>.</p>

<p>
The first premise holds that all disputes arise from language. From
his studies within the M&#257;dhyamaka School, W&#335;nhyo recognized
the effects and limitations of language. This philosophy discerns two
levels of truth: the conventional truth expressed in words, and the
ineffable, ultimate truth. Language facilitates understanding, yet it
fails to capture things in their entirety. Hence, teachings
articulated through language cannot fully convey the complete truth of
Buddhism. The second premise posits that all Buddhist schools
encapsulate facets of Buddha&rsquo;s teachings, regardless of the
potential limitations of comprehension. This principle is inspired by
the famous Lotus s&#363;tra parable of the blind men and the elephant.
In this parable, blind men each touch a part of an elephant, leading
to varying interpretations of what the creature is. W&#335;nhyo
related this parable to Buddhist doctrinal disputes, viewing each
school as recognizing only part of Buddha&rsquo;s teachings while
insisting that their interpretation was the sole correct one. With
these principles as the foundation, W&#335;nhyo developed his
harmonization theory, known as &ldquo;<em>hwajaeng</em>&rdquo;,
advocating for non-attachment to any particular doctrine. Free from
polarization, he scrutinized each doctrine&rsquo;s internal validity
and legitimacy through a stance of non-obstruction, neither affirming
nor denying any of them. He saw doctrinal disputes from Buddha&rsquo;s
higher perspective, transforming them into diverse facets of a unified
body of teaching without any classification.</p>

<p>
Interpretations of W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s <em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy
have evolved over time in the historical context of Korea. The first
association of W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s name with the <em>hwajaeng</em>
concept was documented in the writings of &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n
(&#32681;&#22825;, 1055&ndash;1101 CE), who sought to unify Buddhist
doctrine and practice during the Kory&#335; dynasty. Under Japanese
occupation, W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s <em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy became
associated with the concept of Unified Buddhism (<em>T&rsquo;ong
Pulgyo</em>), regarded as a distinctive feature of Korean Buddhism.
This Unified Buddhism, perceived as a complete form of Buddhism
integrating all Buddhist teachings, served to foster pride in Korean
Buddhism by positioning it above other regional Buddhist traditions.
After Korea&rsquo;s liberation, the meaning of <em>hwajaeng</em>
shifted from &ldquo;unification&rdquo; to
&ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; reflecting the broader societal
transition from authoritarianism to a more pluralistic democracy.
Within this evolving context, Shim Jaeryong and a group of scholars
trained abroad began to critique the concept of Unified Buddhism,
arguing that it was an illusory construct rooted in nationalist
ideology (Cho, 2004). In contemporary times, W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s
<em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy has been suggested as a potential remedy
for conflict resolution and social polarization.</p>

<h3 id="ArrSnBud">2.4 Arrival of S&#335;n Buddhism</h3>

<p>
In the seventh century, S&#335;n (Ch. <em>Chan</em>, Jp. <em>Zen</em>)
Buddhism was introduced to the Shilla Kingdom. Instead of elaborate
rituals and complex doctrines, it focuses on meditation practice. Chan
Buddhism put forward the idea of realizing Buddhahood, which is the
attainment of enlightenment. According to Chan Buddhism, all sentient
beings possess Buddha nature and have the potential to become a
Buddha. Buddha nature is not merely a seed of potential to become a
Buddha, but rather, the true mind of all beings. Therefore, Mazu Daoyi
(709&ndash;788), the eighth patriarch of Chinese Chan Buddhism,
advocated for the belief that the &ldquo;Ordinary mind is the
Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;This mind is Buddha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Mazu S&#335;n found favor among the ruling provincial class
(<em>hojok</em>) in Shilla beginning in the ninth century (Huh: 2005:
32&ndash;33). His teachings bear notable similarities to those of the
doctrinal Huayan School, both of which were founded on the
Tath&#257;gatagarbha teaching and upheld the purity of the human mind.
Mazu Chan emphasized practice and sudden enlightenment, urging
practitioners to view all beings as manifestations of Buddha nature
and their own minds as the Buddha mind.</p>

<h2 id="BudDurKorDyn">3. Buddhism During the Kory&#335; Dynasty</h2>

<p>
During the Kory&#335; dynasty, tensions arose among various Buddhist
schools, particularly between the doctrinal traditions and the
S&#335;n Buddhism. These tensions reflected differing expectations
regarding the role and interpretation of Buddhist teachings, as well
as varying levels of alignment with state patronage. In contrast to
these intra-Buddhist dynamics, Confucianism and Buddhism generally
functioned in separate spheres. However, by the end of the dynasty,
Neo-Confucianism had emerged as the preferred philosophy among the
elite class.</p>

<h3 id="UniBudTea">3.1 Unification of Buddhist Teachings</h3>

<p>
Doctrinal traditions emphasize the systematic study of scriptures,
conceptual analysis, and the gradual cultivation of wisdom through
intellectual understanding. In contrast, meditation-centered S&#335;n
schools prioritize direct, non-conceptual experience of awakening,
often challenging the efficacy of verbal teachings and logical
reasoning. This tension reflects deeper questions about the nature of
enlightenment&mdash;whether it arises through analytical comprehension
or intuitive realization&mdash;and whether language serves as a
vehicle for truth or an obstacle to it. Doctrinal teachings risk
becoming abstract or scholastic, while meditative approaches may
dismiss the value of philosophical clarity. In response to this
longstanding tension, two prominent monks proposed distinct methods
for integrating these divergent paths. &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n
advocated for the harmony of doctrines and practices and became known
for achieving unification from a doctrinal perspective. On the other
hand, Chinul advocated for a S&#335;n approach to unifying practice
and Hwa&#335;m doctrine.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Harmonizing Doctrine and Practice&mdash;&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n (&#32681;&#22825;, 1055&ndash;1101 CE)</h4>

<p>
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n, who studied Hwa&#335;m (Ch. Huayan) and
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae (Ch. Tiantai; Jp. Tendai) Buddhism in both
Korea and China, is traditionally regarded as the founder of the
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae school in Kory&#335;. However, due to his
strong affiliation with the Hwa&#335;m tradition, some scholars have
questioned whether he truly established an independent
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae lineage in Korea (McBride 2016:
32&ndash;36). His efforts at doctrinal harmonization were shaped by
the integrative frameworks of Huayan scholar-monks such as Chengguan
(738&ndash;839) and Zongmi (780&ndash;841), as well as Korean thinker
W&#335;nhyo, from whom he drew key principles to support his vision of
unity among Buddhist teachings.</p>

<p>
Upon his return from China, &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n observed
significant similarities between the teachings of Hwa&#335;m and
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae and explored the doctrinal elements they
shared. Influenced by Chengguan, he proposed that the taxonomies
employed by both schools were structurally aligned (McBride 2016: 136;
Lee 2002: 135&ndash;155). By drawing connections between the Huayan
and Tiantai classifications, &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n underscored their
shared vision of a reality in which all phenomena are
interpenetrating&mdash;each moment and entity reflecting the whole.
This ontological insight served as the metaphysical basis for
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n&rsquo;s broader project of doctrinal
harmonization (McBride 2016: 149&ndash;152).</p>

<p>
Although &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n initially advocated for the study of
various Buddhist doctrines, he did not imply that all teachings were
equally beneficial for study. Later, influenced by W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s
<em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy, his perspective evolved, and he sought
to harmonize all Buddhist teachings and treat them with equal regard.
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n introduced W&#335;nhyo as Korea&rsquo;s first
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae scholar and extolled him as the master of
<em>hwajaeng</em>. (McBride 2016: 78, 146) He also recognized Ch&rsquo;egwan
(&#35558;&#35264;, died 970 CE) as the second
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae scholar. A Kory&#335; monk who had studied
in China, Ch&rsquo;egwan wrote an influential introductory book on the
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae school, <em>Essentials of the Four Stages
of Teaching of Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae</em>
(<em>Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae sagyo&#365;i</em>,
&#22825;&#21488;&#22235;&#25934;&#20736;), summarizing the core
teachings of Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae.</p>

<p>
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n considered the perspective of Zongmi as the
epitome of reconciling doctrinal teaching and S&#335;n practice
perfectly. (McBride, 2016: 85&ndash;89) He believed that the S&#335;n and
doctrinal schools held equal importance and were compatible. While the
S&#335;n school eschewed language, the doctrinal schools embraced it.
These contrasting stances had their respective merits and flaws,
rendering them complementary. Furthermore, adopting Zongmi&rsquo;s
perspective, &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n identified common ground between
Confucianism and Buddhism. Despite their doctrinal differences, he
noted that both philosophies emphasized the importance of filial
piety. (McBride, 2016: 81) Consequently, he sought to harmonize these
philosophies under a single system, scrutinizing their shared
idea.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Reconciling Meditation and Doctrine&mdash;Chinul (&#30693;&#35365;, 1158&ndash;1210)</h4>

<p>
Chinul, one of the most influential Buddhist philosophers in Korea,
pursued a reconciliation of meditation and doctrine by identifying
their shared ground. He considered meditation, namely S&#335;n, and
doctrine, specifically Hwa&#335;m teaching, as two distinct pathways
leading to enlightenment.</p>

<p>
Chinul&rsquo;s approach to unifying practice and doctrine was inspired
by Zongmi, although he developed his own variations. (H0074; Lee 2002:
201&ndash;227) Zongmi categorized Chan Buddhism and doctrinal Buddhism into
three levels each and unified them on each level. In other words, the
first level of Chan aligned with the first level of the doctrinal
school, and so forth. Contrarily, Chinul did not adhere to this
three-tiered classification of S&#335;n Buddhism. Instead, he
categorized S&#335;n Buddhism based on whether it discussed sudden
enlightenment, resulting in two classification levels. Then, he
unified only the practice based on sudden enlightenment and the
doctrine of perfect teachings. Sudden enlightenment represents a
radical epistemic shift in which wisdom is not attained through
discursive reasoning but is instead revealed through an intuitive
insight that transcends conventional thought. Perfect teaching,
especially as developed in Hwa&#335;m (Huayan) Buddhism, articulates a
vision of the total interpenetration of all phenomena
(&#20107;&#20107;&#28961;&#31001;, <em>shishi wu&rsquo;ai</em>), where
each phenomenon reflects and contains all others.</p>

<p>
This unification is possible because both approaches incorporate two
complementary ways of explaining enlightenment: the negative way and
the affirmative way. The negative way outlined the limits of language
and thought and revealed the nature of the mind. The affirmative way
perceived the mind as the essence of all beings and demonstrated its
role in creating things through dependent origination. While Zongmi
used these approaches to explain doctrinal teachings, Chinul employed
them to harmonize S&#335;n and perfect teaching. S&#335;n Buddhism
primarily employs the negative way to challenge the boundaries of
thought and the positive way to emphasize the potency of the
mind&rsquo;s nature. Perfect teaching elucidated the tranquil nature
and the dependent origination of all beings. Essentially, Chinul found
that the <em>Xingqi</em> in Hwa&#335;m teachings aligned with the
S&#335;n teaching that each individual&rsquo;s mind is the
Buddha&rsquo;s mind. Based on this discovery, he proposed that
doctrinal teaching represented the word of Buddha while meditational
teaching embodied the mind of Buddha.</p>

<h3 id="ForKorSnBud">3.2 The Formation of Korean S&#335;n Buddhism</h3>

<p>
During the mid-Kory&#335; Dynasty, Chinul introduced a new form of
practice called Kanhwa S&#335;n, which became the primary practice in
Korean S&#335;n Buddhism. Considered the founder of the Chogye Order,
the most significant Buddhist sect in contemporary Korea, Chinul
proposed several key characteristics of his practice: the concepts of
&ldquo;void and calm, numinous awareness&rdquo; (K. <em>kongj&#335;k
y&#335;ngji</em> &#31354;&#23490;&#38728;&#30693;), &ldquo;sudden
enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation&rdquo;, and the
&ldquo;dual practice of <em>sam&#257;dhi</em> and
<em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em> (K.<em>ch&#335;nghye ssangsu</em>
&#23450;&#24935;&#38617;&#20462;)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Grounded in the Buddha-nature theory, S&#335;n Buddhism emphasized
direct experiential practice aimed at realizing one&rsquo;s true
nature. However, this teaching of universal potential for
enlightenment simultaneously raises a critical question: if all beings
inherently possess Buddha-nature, why are ordinary people unable to
perceive it? In his work <em>Secrets on Cultivating the Mind</em>
(<em>Susimgy&#335;l</em>, &#20462;&#24515;&#35363;), Chinul provided
an answer: just as we cannot see our own body, we cannot perceive the
Buddha nature because we are immersed in it and it resides within us
(Chinul SW: 208). This Buddha nature is recognized through &ldquo;the
mind of void and calm, numinous awareness.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;void
and calm&rdquo; suggests that the mind is insubstantial and reflects
all things, similar to a placid lake. &ldquo;Numinous awareness&rdquo;
involves self-contemplation, illumination of the Buddha nature, and
the ability to respond to the interconnected world. The concept
&ldquo;the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness&rdquo;
corresponds to the subjective aspect of the Buddha mind, while the
objective aspect aligns with Buddha nature. While these concepts are
not existentially divided, they are conceptually separated in the
context of the principle of dependent origination. This pure and
authentic mind is also referred to as the &ldquo;original face&rdquo;
(K. <em>pollae my&#335;nmok</em>, &#26412;&#20358;&#38754;&#30446;) in
the S&#335;n tradition. When compared to Zongmi&rsquo;s concept of
&ldquo;original enlightenment and true mind&rdquo; (Ch.
<em>benjuezhenxin</em>, &#26412;&#35258;&#30494;&#24515;), referring
to the pure mind, the terminology used by Chinul offers a more
detailed portrayal of the characteristics of the true mind.</p>

<p>
The debate between sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation was a
pivotal discussion in Chan Buddhism. Advocates from the Southern Chan
school argued for sudden enlightenment, claiming that immediate
insight is sufficient to prove one&rsquo;s enlightenment, and no
additional cultivation is required. Conversely, the Northern Chan
school supported the practice of gradual cultivation, considering the
human mind to be inherently pure but enshrouded by defilement that
requires gradual removal to allow enlightenment to occur. Adopting
Zongmi&rsquo;s approach, Chinul advocated for a dual practice of
sudden enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation. He suggested
that gradual cultivation is necessary after sudden enlightenment to
prevent the recurrence of habitual actions and thoroughly eliminate
defilements. He defined true cultivation as a process of cultivation
without cultivating anything (Chinul SW: 227). This implies that,
after sudden enlightenment, one realizes that deluded thoughts are
essentially void, leaving no tangible defilement to be removed.
Consequently, the cultivation process progresses without attachment,
meaning the practitioner cultivates without clinging to the idea of
eradication.</p>

<p>
Chinul emphasized the integrated practice of <em>sam&#257;dhi</em>
(concentration) and <em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em> (wisdom), which he
regarded as the two essential pillars of meditation.
<em>Sam&#257;dhi</em> stabilizes the mind, cultivating a state of calm
and clarity, while <em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em> penetrates the nature
of reality, allowing one to perceive things as they truly are. Chinul
maintained that without <em>sam&#257;dhi</em>, insight lacks the
steadiness to see clearly, and without <em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em>,
concentration alone cannot eliminate the root of defilements. Thus,
like two sides of the same coin, <em>sam&#257;dhi</em> and
<em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em> are not separate paths but mutually
supportive aspects of a single practice. Additionally, he expanded
their interpretations of these concepts, linking <em>sam&#257;dhi</em>
to S&#335;n practice and <em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em> to doctrinal
teaching, thereby fusing S&#335;n and Hwa&#335;m in his practice. He
further corresponded those practices to the essence and function
(Chinul SW: 230). The essence is <em>sam&#257;dhi,</em> and the
function is <em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em>. As essence and function are
inseparable, so those two practices are inseparable, as well. The
balance between them held a pivotal role in Chinul&rsquo;s teaching,
as demonstrated by his three approaches to S&#335;n practice:
&ldquo;equal maintenance of quiescence and alertness&rdquo; (K.
<em>s&#335;ngj&#335;k t&#365;ngji</em>,
&#24826;&#23490;&#31561;&#25345;), &ldquo;faith and understanding
according to the complete and sudden teaching&rdquo; (K.
<em>w&#335;ndon shinhae</em>, &#22291;&#38931;&#20449;&#35299;), and
&ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; (K. <em>ky&#335;ngj&#335;l</em>,
&#24465;&#25130;). &ldquo;Equal maintenance of quiescence and
alertness&rdquo; refers to the dual practice of <em>sam&#257;dhi</em>
and <em>praj&ntilde;&#257;</em>. &ldquo;Faith and understanding
according to the complete and sudden teaching&rdquo; are connected to
the equal practice of S&#335;n and Hwa&#335;m&rsquo;s doctrinal
teaching. Complete teaching refers to Hwa&#335;m teaching, and sudden
teaching refers to S&#335;n. The shortcut refers to Kanhwa S&#335;n
(Ch. Kanhua Chan, &#30475;&#35441;&#31146;) practice, which leads
directly to enlightenment.</p>

<p>
Established by Dahui Zonggao (1089&ndash;1163), Kanhua Chan practice
concentrates on <em>huatou</em> (K. <em>hwadu</em>, Jp.
<em>wat&#333;</em>),  the critical phrase extracted from
Chan dialogues known as <em>gongan</em> (K. <em>kongan</em>, Jp.
<em>k&#333;an</em>).  In his <em>Treatise on Resolving Doubt about
Observing the Keyword</em> (<em>Kanhwa ky&#335;r&#365;iron</em>
&#30475;&#35441;&#27770;&#30097;&#35542;), Chinul advocated for this
practice, deeming it the most effective way to liberate oneself from
the maladies in the conceptual understanding of the Buddhist truth
(Chinul SW: 317). Even though doctrinal principles convey profound and
sublime teachings, they are nonetheless constrained by language. The
S&#335;n tradition recognizes the limitations of language, which
naturally creates a dichotomy between subject and object, leading to a
dualistic framework. Aware of this dichotomy, Chinul distinguished
between two aspects of <em>hwadu</em>: investigating the meaning (K.
<em>ch&rsquo;am&#365;i</em>, &#21443;&#24847;) and investigating the
word (K. <em>ch&rsquo;amgu</em>, &#21443;&#21477;). Investigating the
meaning involves interpreting <em>hwadu</em> within a doctrinal
context while investigating the word that utilizes <em>hwadu</em> to
liberate oneself from conceptual knowledge. These two methods are also
related to two types of <em>hwadu</em>, namely, the living word (K.
<em>hwalgu</em>) and the dead word (K. <em>sagu</em>). The living word
facilitates the practitioner&rsquo;s return to the original state of
emptiness, thus freeing them from the preconceived notions created by
linguistic structures. Conversely, the dead word represents the
opposite process.</p>

<p>
The framework of Chinul&rsquo;s practice predominantly rests on the
principle of sudden enlightenment, understood as the realization of
one&rsquo;s Buddha nature. To engage in this practice, a practitioner
should first firmly believe in their inherent Buddhahood. Following
this, the Kanhwa S&#335;n practice enables practitioners to experience
the Buddha within themselves, leading to gradual cultivation. This
grounding in the balance of two forms of meditation allows
practitioners to perceive the two facets of Buddha nature: its
calmness and its colorful arising. Further, this gradual cultivation
aims to eliminate defilements completely. Since Chinul&rsquo;s time,
this approach combining sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation,
with the addition of Kanhwa S&#335;n practice as a shortcut, has been
considered the standard practice in Korean S&#335;n Buddhism. This
synthesis is the hallmark of Chinul&rsquo;s system of practice.</p>

<h2 id="ConBetBudNeoConChoDyn">4. Conversations between Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism in the Chos&#335;n Dynasty</h2>

<p>
The Chos&#335;n dynasty marked a challenging period for Korean
Buddhism. The ruling Neo-Confucian scholars criticized and suppressed
Buddhism for its perceived corruption and its teachings that opposed
Confucian values. In response, Buddhists emphasized the similarities
between Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism and embraced Confucian ethics,
including principles of loyalty and filial piety.</p>

<h3 id="CriDefBud">4.1 Critique and Defense of Buddhism</h3>

<p>
Criticism of Buddhism from Neo-Confucian scholars began in the late
Kory&#335; dynasty, once Buddhism&rsquo;s socio-economic privileges
and their negative consequences were taken seriously. A notable critic
was Ch&#335;ng Toj&#335;n (1342&ndash;1398 CE), a foundational figure
in shaping Neo-Confucian ideologogy during the early Chos&#335;n
dynasty. In his work <em>An Array of Critiques of Buddhism</em>
(<em>Pulssi chappy&#335;n</em>, &#20315;&#27663;&#38620;&#36776;), he
voiced his objections to both the philosophy and practices of
Buddhism. In response to these critiques, Buddhist monk Hamh&#335;
T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong (&#28085;&#34395;&#24471;&#36890;, 1376&ndash;1433
CE) wrote <em>The Exposition of Orthodoxy</em>
(<em>Hy&#335;nj&#335;ngnon</em>, &#39023;&#27491;&#35542;), to correct
widespread misunderstandings of Buddhism among Neo-Confucian scholars.
While the two were never directly debated, these two works highlight
the points of contention and defense regarding Buddhism during the
Chos&#335;n dynasty.</p>

<p>
Ch&#335;ng believed Buddhist philosophy was inherently illogical, and
its religious practice hurt Confucian values. His criticisms extended
to various aspects of Buddhist doctrines, including transmigration,
karma, mind and nature, and ethical principles.</p>

<p>
Regarding the concept of transmigration, Ch&#335;ng argued from a
Confucian perspective that once the soul combines with Yin and Yang
and separates into heaven and earth after death, they can never
reunite, rendering rebirth impossible. He used the analogy of water
drawn from a well, which, once taken, cannot return to the well.
Additionally, Ch&#335;ng challenged the concept of transmigration by
stating that, if it were true, the number of beings in the world would
always be the same, but this is not the case. In discussing the causes
and effects of karma, he argued that people&rsquo;s fortune and
misfortune are decided by timing, not only by cause and effect. He
likened this idea to the process of making liquor, which only develops
a good taste when the mixture of ingredients has had sufficient time
to ferment.</p>

<p>
Ch&#335;ng also highlights the inconsistency within Buddhist teachings
concerning the relationship between the mind (K. <em>sim</em>
&#24515;) and the nature (K. <em>s&#335;ng</em> &#24615;). From his
Neo-Confucian perspective, nature represents the principle instilled
by heaven, while the mind forms through material force (K. <em>ki</em>
<em>&#27683;</em>), encompassing both nature and emotion (K.
<em>ch&#335;ng &#24773;</em>). With this foundation, he criticizes
Buddhism for its perceived internal contradiction in equating the mind
with nature. He began by pointing out conflicting definitions of these
concepts within Buddhist scriptures, where the mind and nature were
both equated and differentiated. Delusion was associated with the
mind, while awakening was linked to nature. Ch&#335;ng also took issue
with phrases such as &ldquo;Observe the mind and see the nature&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Mind is none other than nature&rdquo; (Ch&#335;ng CB: 60),
arguing that they created a logical fallacy similar to attempting to
eat one&rsquo;s own mouth.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Ch&#335;ng criticized two Buddhist arguments:
&ldquo;functional activity is the nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;mind and
its trace&rdquo;. S&#335;n Buddhist masters would assert that all
human activities were manifestations of the Buddha nature. Ch&#335;ng
questioned this perspective, suggesting that if one accepted
Buddhism&rsquo;s idea, then acts such as killing others could be
labeled as the functional activity of nature. In his Neo-Confucian
philosophy, nature represented a pure moral principle centered in the
mind, which interacted with external stimuli. Therefore, he viewed
Buddhism&rsquo;s central argument as flawed. Regarding the concept of
the mind and its trace, he critiqued Buddhism for separating them,
citing a Buddhist sentence: &ldquo;If the bodhisattva
Ma&ntilde;ju&#347;r&#299; wanders taverns, his behavior is wrong, but
his mind is right&rdquo; (Ch&#335;ng CB: 64, 121). In his perspective,
the mind is equated to essence (K. <em>che</em>), and trace represents
function (K. <em>yong</em>), rendering them inseparable.</p>

<p>
Ch&#335;ng also offered a critique of the metaphysical foundations of
Buddhism. Citing Buddhist teachings that state, &ldquo;Good and evil
are from mind. The myriad of phenomena is nothing but
consciousness,&rdquo; he argues that this viewpoint portrays the
phenomenal world as an illusory creation of consciousness and mind,
devoid of a solid foundation. Consequently, he asserted that such a
perspective hinders the objective assessment of good or bad behavior
based on moral principles called nature.</p>

<p>
In terms of Buddhist practice, Ch&#335;ng, along with other Confucian
scholars, viewed Buddhism&rsquo;s promotion of renunciation of
familial ties and indiscriminate compassion as particularly
problematic. Monks&rsquo; abandonment of their families and their
celibacy contradicted Confucian values, which placed great importance
on marriage and procreation as forms of filial piety. Additionally,
Buddhism&rsquo;s universal compassion conflicted with
Confucianism&rsquo;s emphasis on distinguishing between family and
others. Ch&#335;ng also pointed out that monks, in their
indiscriminate compassion, were even willing to sacrifice their bodies
to leopards, a behavior that he considered a violation of the practice
of filial piety. In summary, Ch&#335;ng Toj&#335;n&rsquo;s critique
aimed to reveal weaknesses in the Buddhist moral framework.</p>

<p>
In defense of Buddhism, Hamh&#335; T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong maintained that
Buddhism and Confucianism were not fundamentally different. Regarding
the topics of transmigration and karma, Hamh&#335; emphasized that
these teachings motivate individuals to engage in good actions rather
than bad ones willingly. Additionally, these teachings promote the
importance of emotional control, which fosters self-discipline and
encourages virtuous deeds.</p>

<p>
While Hamh&#335; T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong did not directly comment on the
relationship between the mind and nature, he viewed the mind as more
than just an illusory empty entity; instead, he saw it as an active
and luminous entity, somewhat akin to the Confucian concept of
&ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo;, which is a characteristic of one&rsquo;s
nature. He also explained the interplay between nature and emotion as
a relationship between essence and function. From his perspective,
nature and emotion are distinct, with a deluded nature giving rise to
emotions. Much like Neo-Confucian scholars, he regarded nature as the
pure aspect and emotions as the impure aspect that arises in relation
to external stimuli.</p>

<p>
When addressing practical ethical issues such as monk celibacy and
universal compassion, Hamh&#335; argued that the choice of monkhood
could provide significant benefits not only to the monks themselves
but also to their parents, family members, and even the nation. He
contended that it represented the highest form of practicing filial
piety and loyalty. Additionally, he equated Confucian virtues,
including benevolence, justice, propriety, wisdom, and trust, with
Buddhism&rsquo;s precepts against killing, theft, sexual misconduct,
alcohol consumption, and lying. Hamh&#335; T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong&rsquo;s
approach to reconciling Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism continued to
exert influence on Buddhist philosophy in the Chos&#335;n Dynasty.</p>

<h3 id="HarBudCon">4.2 Harmonizing Buddhism and Confucianism</h3>

<p>
During the later period of the Chos&#335;n Dynasty, the discourse
seeking harmony between Buddhism and Confucianism gained more
popularity. Although Confucian scholars recognized the similarities
between the two&mdash;both addressing the nature of the mind and
advocating for a simple life&mdash;they maintained criticisms of
Buddhism. During this period of Buddhist suppression, a monk named
H&#335;&#365;ngdang Pou (&#34395;&#25033;&#22530; &#26222;&#38632;
died 1565 CE), who played an instrumental role in the restoration of
Buddhism, endeavored to harmonize the two philosophies. He equated
Buddhist teachings with other teachings through the <em>Flower Garland
s&#363;tra</em>, asserting that both Confucianism and Daoism are
applications of this <em>s&#363;tra</em>. Pou attempted to explain
Buddhist teaching through Confucian concepts and views in his book,
<em>The Treatises of One Rightness (Ilch&#335;ngnon</em>,
&#19968;&#27491;&#35542;). The title, &ldquo;One,&rdquo; signifies the
origin of all beings and the cause of all change, correlating with the
principle of heaven in Neo-Confucianism. All beings exist by obtaining
the principle of heaven, which also facilitates the changes of the
four seasons. &ldquo;Rightness&rdquo; refers to the pure, untainted
mind of Buddhism and the right status of the human mind according to
Confucianism. This righteous state encompasses Confucian elements of
morality: the sense of compassion, shame, respect, and the discernment
of right and wrong. Here, &ldquo;One&rdquo; also represents the world,
and &ldquo;Rightness&rdquo; implies the human mind. Consequently, Pou
asserted that these two become one, resulting in a unity of the world
and the human mind. He expanded his argument by acknowledging that
even though the human mind is connected to the principle of heaven, it
is still influenced by material force, which can tarnish the human
mind. Thus, he proposed practicing Confucian methods, such as
reverence and extending knowledge as a means of purification.</p>

<h2 id="KorBudResMod">5. Korean Buddhism&rsquo;s Response to Modernity</h2>

<p>
In the 19th century, Koreans encountered Western philosophy and
Christianity. This encounter led to an assumption that traditional
elements of Asian culture, including Buddhism, might be considered
irrelevant on the path to modern nationhood. Modernization in Korea
was frequently synonymous with Westernization. Faced with this shift
in perspective, Korean intellectuals embarked on a reevaluation of
Buddhism&rsquo;s role in a modern, Western-influenced society.</p>

<p>
In pursuit of this reevaluation, they posed several crucial questions:
Is Buddhism worthy of preserving? To what genre does Buddhism belong
in the Western academic classification? What are the similarities and
the differences between Buddhism and Western thought? How can Buddhist
philosophy contribute to the future world?</p>

<p>
Moreover, the colonial and postcolonial reality significantly
influenced the perception and development of modern Korean Buddhism,
prompting greater engagement with social issues than during the
Chos&#335;n period.</p>

<h3 id="InvValBudPhiModEra">5.1 Investigating the Value of Buddhist Philosophy in the Modern Era</h3>

<h4>5.1.1 Placing Buddhism in the Western Intellectual Context</h4>

<p>
Korean Buddhists, much like other East Asian Buddhist intellectuals,
have undertaken efforts to interpret Buddhism within the framework of
Western thought. One of the issues they grapple with is the
differentiation between religion and philosophy in Western discourse,
a distinction that does not exist in Eastern discourse. Consequently,
East Asian Buddhist intellectuals, including Koreans, have proposed
that Buddhism encompasses both religious and philosophical elements,
though there is disagreement on which elements specifically belong to
which category.</p>

<p>
Paek Yongs&#335;ng (1864&ndash;1940), a Buddhist monk and reformer, placed
emphasis on Buddhism as a religion. Han Yongun (1879&ndash;1944), a
writer and reformer, directed his focus toward the philosophical
elements. Yi Chongch&rsquo;&#335;n, a scholar who studied under Inoue
Enry&#333; at Toyo University, regarded the doctrinal teachings of
Buddhism as philosophical elements, while considering the practice of
Buddhism as its religious component (Yi 1918: 35&ndash;36). On the
other hand, Paek S&#335;nguk, the first Korean to study philosophy in
Germany, argued that Buddhism is a religion founded on philosophy. In
his article titled &ldquo;Buddhist Metaphysics,&rdquo; he asserted
that Buddhism is a philosophy because it objectively studies truth
obtained from reality, and it is a religion because it involves the
worship of various deities (Paek 1925: 21&ndash;22).</p>

<p>
In the late 1910s and the 1920s, Korean Buddhist philosophers, under
the influence of Inoue Enry&#333; (&#20117;&#19978; &#20870;&#20102;
1858&ndash;1919), began to view Buddhist philosophy as metaphysics.
Inoue, one of the most influential philosophers for East Asian
intellectuals at the time, described Buddhist philosophy as pure
philosophy, in that it examines the essence of the universe and the
principles of truth, aligning with German idealism. Consequently,
Korean Buddhist philosophers delved into metaphysical issues, such as
the relationship between phenomena (<em>dharma</em>) and the actual
reality of all phenomena (suchness, Skt.
<em>Bh&#363;tako&#7789;i</em>). The term &ldquo;actual reality of all
phenomena&rdquo; corresponds to the concept of essence in Western
philosophy. In the context of Buddhist philosophy, it refers to truth,
the ultimate culmination for all beings, and a representation of
things as they are. Kim Ch&rsquo;&#335;lu, a Buddhist scholar,
explores the non-dualism within Buddhist metaphysics. Kim asserts,</p>

<p>
Buddhism&rsquo;s primary principle is that phenomena are the actual
reality of all phenomena. Less developed religions separate the actual
reality of phenomena from phenomena, thus failing to explain the
relationship between the actual reality of phenomena and human beings.
Buddhism, as an advanced religion, proposes the unity of phenomena and
the actual reality of phenomena, elucidating that all phenomena
constitute the actual reality of phenomena. (Kim 1919: 53)</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Paek S&#335;nguk delves into the dynamic tension within
the actual reality of phenomena, which conveys the concept of Buddha
as the ultimate universal truth. Using Western philosophical
categories, he analyzes this truth through two interrelated
aspects: the inherent object-truth and the inherent subject-Buddha.
This dual framing serves not to establish ontological dualism but to
render universal truth more accessible and concrete. In doing so, Paek
affirms both the positivity of the phenomenal world and the active
role of the subject, Buddha, within it. His approach contrasts with
that of Nishida Kitar&#333; (&#35199;&#30000;&#24190;&#22810;&#37086;,
1870&ndash;1945), a prominent philosopher of the Kyoto school. Nishida
Kitar&#333; articulates &ldquo;absolute nothingness&rdquo; as the
dynamic field of self-negation in which the duality of subject and
object dissolves, positing it as the foundational reality through
which all differentiated beings can achieve unity. While Nishida
emphasizes the dissolution of all dualities into a formless ground,
Paek retains a structure affirming the dynamic interplay between self
and world within a non-dual framework. </p>

<h4>5.1.2 Aligning Buddhist Philosophy with Modern Thought</h4>

<p>
During this era, Social Darwinism emerged as a prevailing
intellectual trend, asserting that all cultures must progress, and
only those that advance and adapt can survive. In this context, Han
Yongun took on the challenge of demonstrating the relevance of
Buddhism by identifying its modern elements. He discovered ideas
related to free will and egalitarianism in Buddhist teachings and
argued that Buddhism held the potential to contribute to a better
world than social evolution theory would.</p>

<p>
Drawing inspiration from the works of Liang Qichao (1873&ndash;1929),
a prominent modern Chinese thinker (Han 2016: 105&ndash;108), Han
Yongun equated free will with the Buddhist concept of suchness, the
true nature of all beings. In comparing Kant&rsquo;s philosophy with
Buddhism, Liang Qichao interpreted suchness as the moral subject
possessing free will, whereas the state of ignorance prior to
enlightenment reflects the absence of free will. Liang further argued
that while Kant&rsquo;s moral subject pertains to individuals,
Buddha&rsquo;s suchness applies universally to all human beings. Han
Yongun embraced this interpretation as a basis for asserting
Buddhism&rsquo;s superiority over Western philosophy.</p>

<p>
Moreover, Han Yongun characterized Buddhism as embodying egalitarian
principles. Traditional Buddhist philosophy postulates two levels of
truth: conventional truth and ultimate truth. The former, which
emerges from the principle of cause and effect, holds a variety of
distinct beings. Conversely, the world of ultimate truth represents
the inherent nature of all beings, manifesting its nature of
emptiness. Building upon this philosophical foundation, he
articulated,</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looking from the viewpoint of inequality, there is nothing that is
not unequal, but from the viewpoint of equality, there is nothing that
is not equal. What, then, is inequality? It refers to the fact that
all things and phenomena are subject to the laws of necessity. What
does equality mean? It refers to the free, unconstrained truth that
transcends time and space. &rdquo;(Han 2016: 112&ndash;113)</p>

<p>
In this manner, Han Yongun brought a modern sensibility to Buddhist
teachings. Moreover, he envisioned a Buddhism-led future, arguing that
its core doctrines guaranteed freedom for all within an egalitarian
framework. Building on that perspective, he planned to incorporate
socialist ideas with his egalitarian outlook, thereby formulating a
vision of Buddhist socialism grounded in socio-economic equality.</p>

<h4>5.1.3 Comparison of Buddhism to Christianity</h4>

<p>
In response to the competition posed by Christian missionary efforts,
Paek Yongs&#335;ng (1864&ndash;1940) embarked on a comparative
analysis between Christianity and Buddhism with the aim of
demonstrating the superiority of Buddhism (Paek 2016). He argued that
Christianity lacked a comprehensive understanding of the mind, even
though it shared similarities to Buddhism in terms of the concept of a
fair exchange of good deeds and their rewards. Expanding on this
viewpoint, he critiqued the notion of God as a separate creator
distinct from his creations. According to Buddhist philosophy, the
original mind gives rise to all beings, and Buddha&rsquo;s mind
resides within the minds of individuals. He also criticized the idea
of divine punishment for original sin, as it seemed harsh for a
creator to chastise individuals after permitting them to err.</p>

<h4>5.1.4 The Identity of Korean Buddhism</h4>

<p>
Amid the effort to align Buddhism with Western thought, a movement
emerged to preserve traditional Korean Buddhism and rediscover its
distinct identity. Monk S&#335;kj&#335;n (1870&ndash;1948) is one of
the leading figures of it. He started teaching Buddhist classics to
individuals passionate about Korean studies and the essence of
Korea&rsquo;s spirit. Among his students, Ch&rsquo;oe Nams&#335;n
(1890&ndash;1957) wrote two articles delineating the identity of
Korean Buddhism: &ldquo;Overview of Korean Buddhism: A Diachronic
Approach to Korean Buddhism&rdquo; (1918) and &ldquo;Korean Buddhism:
Its Position in the Cultural History of the East&rdquo; (1930).
Through these works, he emphasizes that Korean Buddhism played an
active and significant role in the evolution of Buddhism in East Asia,
rather than merely assimilating Chinese Buddhism into their own
culture. He asserts that Korean Buddhism surpassed other East Asian
forms of Buddhism, both in its philosophical depth and artistic
expression.</p>

<p>
Ch&rsquo;oe Nams&#335;n gives special attention to the
<em>hwajaeng</em> (reconciling Buddhist doctrines) philosophy of
W&#335;nhyo, which encapsulates all Buddhist teachings and practices
as one. He dubbed this form of Buddhism as &ldquo;unified
Buddhism,&rdquo; &ldquo;completed Buddhism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;synthesis
Buddhism (K. <em>T&rsquo;ong Pulgyo</em>),&rdquo; branding it as the
distinctive identity of Korean Buddhism. Ch&rsquo;oe&rsquo;s arguments
continued to be well-received by Korean Buddhist scholars even after
Korea&rsquo;s liberation, leading to &ldquo;Unified Buddhism&rdquo;
being perceived as a defining characteristic of Korean Buddhism. This
view remained largely unchallenged until 1985, when Shim Jaeryong
brought it into question (Shim 1999: 171&ndash;181). He argued that
the idea of unified Buddhism as a defining feature of Korean Buddhism
had been taken up without rigorous scrutiny. Building on Shim&rsquo;s
critique, scholars trained outside of Korea took a more critical
stance, contending that unified Buddhism was a product of nationalism
and nationalist historiography and, thus, a historical
fabrication.</p>

<h3 id="PopBud">5.2 Popularizing Buddhism</h3>

<p>
The essence of modernity lies in its emancipation from mysticism,
embracing human reason, and promoting individual rights. These notions
also resonated with the transformation of Korean Buddhism from the
late 19th to the 20th century. Buddhist intellectuals reinterpreted
traditional practices through the lens of individual responsibility
for awakening, aligning it with modern notions of self-cultivation and
social responsibility. This shift implies a revaluation of Buddhist
soteriology&mdash;from salvation as divine favor to enlightenment as a
self-driven ethical and existential project rooted in everyday life.
In doing so, Korean Buddhism positioned itself not as an otherworldly
tradition but as a modern moral philosophy capable of addressing
personal and societal suffering.</p>

<h4>5.2.1 Enlightenment and Social Engagement</h4>

<p>
Paek Yongs&#335;ng identified enlightenment as the unique and pivotal
aspect of Buddhist thought, aiming to reestablish its original intent
in the lives of laypeople. Rooted in S&#335;n Buddhism,
&ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; denoted the realization of one&rsquo;s
intrinsic Buddhahood. Great enlightenment, in this context, signifies
the attainment of the original nature of the human mind. According to
Paek, every individual should not only attain enlightenment but also
actively help others achieve the same realization. Enlightenment, in
his view, was a path to uncovering one&rsquo;s true identity and inner
strength. To promote this vision, he founded the Order of Great
Awakening (<em>Taegakkyo</em>) in 1922 and launched the Great
Awakening (<em>Taegak</em>) school movement, which provided
laypeople&mdash;who had previously lacked access&mdash;with
opportunities to participate in meditation classes. However,
Paek&rsquo;s emphasis extended beyond personal liberation; he
underscored the importance of socially engaged practice, rooted in the
Buddhist ideal of &ldquo;saving all sentient beings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Paek Yongs&#335;ng and Han Yongun were not just theorists but also
activists who energetically participated in social movements, such as
the Korean Independence movement. While Han Yongun was intrigued by
social Buddhism, he did not develop his own comprehensive social
theory. In contrast, Paek S&#335;nguk expanded his philosophical
journey to include social theory. After a thorough examination of
cosmology, he posited that a single principle (K. <em>illi</em>)
constructed the cosmos. Applying this principle to the human world, he
argued that it could transform this impure land into the Pure Land
(Paek 2021: 81).</p>

<p>
According to Paek, this principle applies to three aspects of human
life: in legal life, it dictates the rules of human communities; in
economic life, it ensures a fair distribution of resources; and in
spiritual life, it bestows meaning to existence. Paek contended that
each facet of life should maintain its boundaries and balance, with
spiritual life taking the lead. An excessive focus on legal life might
suppress economic equality and individual freedom, while an
overemphasis on economic life could turn humans into mere working
machines. If spiritual life remained intertwined with the other
spheres, that might disrupt harmful patterns there, ultimately
benefiting humanity and shaping a more humane existence. In his social
theory, Paek S&#335;nguk effectively fused the Hwa&#335;m Buddhist
philosophy with the modern social theory.</p>

<h4>5.2.2 Won Buddhism</h4>

<p>
Won Buddhism, a relatively modern Buddhist movement, was founded by
Park Chungbin (1891&ndash;1943), who became known as Sot&rsquo;aesan.
Interestingly, Park did not undergo formal training in the Buddhist
tradition; instead, his connection to Buddhism emerged after
enlightenment, which he recognized as akin to the descriptions of
enlightenment found in Buddhism. Won Buddhism predominantly embraces
Buddhist teachings but reformulates them in a manner that is more
accessible to laypeople. Central to its philosophy is the belief that
Buddhism should transcend distinctions between Buddhist clergy and lay
practitioners, as well as between Buddha and sentient beings. The
doctrinal foundation of Won Buddhism is articulated in the
<em>Scripture of Won Buddhism</em> (<em>W&#335;n Pulgyo
kyoj&#335;n</em>).</p>

<p>
At the core of Won Buddhism&rsquo;s doctrinal framework lies the
concept of the &ldquo;One Circle Form&rdquo; (K.
<em>irw&#335;nsang</em>), symbolizing the dharmak&#257;ya Buddha,
which represents the essence of all beings and Buddhas, as well as
Buddha nature. This concept is depicted in a circular form because it
signifies the perpetual transformation between being and non-being,
revealing their inherent emptiness and completeness. The ultimate
objective of Won Buddhism is to attain Buddhahood, aligning with the
aspirations of other Buddhist traditions. To achieve this
enlightenment, Sot&rsquo;aesan introduced the framework of the
fourfold grace of human life and three practices. The fourfold grace
includes heaven and earth, parents, brethren, and law, as they grant
life and support one&rsquo;s existence. The three core practices in
Won Buddhism mirror the traditional Buddhist triad of concentration
(Skt. <em>sam&#257;dhi</em>), wisdom, and precepts. These practices
are structured as follows: cultivation of the spirit (K.
<em>ch&#335;ngsin suyang</em>), inquiry into facts and principles (K.
<em>sari y&#335;n&rsquo;gu</em>), and careful selection of karmic
actions (K. <em>chag&#335;p ch&rsquo;wisa</em>).</p>

<p>
Adapted from the foundational principles of Buddhism, these practices
serve as a guide for spiritual development. In daily life,
practitioners are encouraged to engage in regular meditation called
&ldquo;timeless s&#335;n&rdquo; (K. <em>musi s&#335;np&#335;b</em>)
and adhere to the nine essential dharmas of daily practice, intending
to dispel afflictions. Among these nine rules, three correspond to the
fundamental practices mentioned earlier, emphasizing the
transformation of negative mindsets into positive virtues, including
belief, zeal, dedication, gratitude, self-reliance, and goodwill.</p>

<h4>5.2.3 Socially Engaged Buddhism</h4>

<p>
In the 1980s, Minjung Buddhism emerged as part of the Minjung movement
in South Korea, a social movement dedicated to the liberation of the
&ldquo;<em>minjung.</em>&rdquo; The term
&ldquo;<em>minjung,</em>&rdquo; which means &ldquo;common
people,&rdquo; refers to those who are oppressed by the ruling class
but who nonetheless have the potential to become agents in shaping
history. Alongside Minjung movement activists, young Buddhists
established the Minjung Buddhism Society in 1975. Ch&#335;n
Chaes&#335;ng wrote &ldquo;The Theory of Minjung Buddhism&rdquo; and
published it in the journal <em>Dialogue</em> (<em>Taehwa</em>) in
1977. Although the article did not present an intense, argumentative
discourse, it did introduce the basic principles of Minjung Buddhism
and encouraged young Buddhists to participate in the social and
political reality of Korean society.</p>

<p>
Minjung Buddhists derived their theoretical framework from Buddhist
philosophy, adapted via Marxist theory. They first sought Buddhist
teachings that resonated with Marxist ideology and found numerous
similarities between Marxism and early Buddhism. Both systems embrace
atheism, materialism, empiricism, and egalitarianism. Here, the term
materialism differs from 19th-century mechanistic materialism; rather
than reducing existence to inert matter, early Buddhism recognizes the
material and physical conditions of life as fundamental to suffering,
causality, and transformation. Without appealing to divine
intervention, early Buddhism explained the world in empirical and
ethical terms. It depicted <em>r&#363;pa</em> (form/matter) as a foundational
element of human existence, emphasized empiricism, and advocated for
egalitarian communities of monks akin to the primitive communities
described by Marx.</p>

<p>
Later, the Buddhist monk, P&#335;ps&#335;ng, brought together the
varied threads of Minjung Buddhist philosophical discourse and
highlighted how Minjung Buddhism reinterpreted fundamental Buddhist
concepts to reveal the revolutionary characteristics of Buddhism. The
concepts included dependent arising, karma, and Pure Land, with all
new interpretations pointing towards emphasizing the self-reliance of
the minjung or general public.</p>

<p>
The Buddhist principle of dependent arising supports the social
engagement of Buddhism. It situates each individual&rsquo;s life in
the broader scope of history and reveals history to be a tapestry
woven from the threads of individual lives. Additionally, one&rsquo;s
deeds and social activities lead to social change because people and
society are interconnected. This new interpretation of Buddhist
concepts formed the basis for the argument that the <em>minjung</em>
has the capacity to promote change.</p>

<p>
Minjung Buddhists also understood karma as people&rsquo;s creative
activity that shapes the world and transforms themselves. Utilizing
the concept of &ldquo;karma,&rdquo; they emphasized human
self-reliance, asserting that without human action or karma, no change
or revolution can occur. They drew parallels between the Marxist
concept of &ldquo;motion,&rdquo; a fundamental principle in
dialectical materialism that denotes the continuous change in the
world and human thought, and karma. They proposed that the motion of
the world is a universal principle, and karma embodies this principle
in humans. That is, karma is the expression of human engagement with
the world, and it constitutes a part of the world&rsquo;s overall
motion. One&rsquo;s past karma influences the present, and present
karma molds the future, implying that the entire world is shaped by
the power of karma. The emphasis on human self-reliance in the concept
of karma is strongly tied to the idea of the <em>minjung</em>, which
signifies not just those who are oppressed but also those who are
agents of historical and social change. Both Minjung Buddhism and
Minjung Theology highlight the potential of the <em>minjung</em> to
bring about revolution.</p>

<p>
Minjung Buddhists aimed to establish an ideal society called the Pure
Land (<em>Ch&#335;ngt&rsquo;o</em>). Traditionally, Pure Land Buddhist
philosophy has two aspects: being reborn in Amita Buddha&rsquo;s Pure
Land and creating the Pure Land in this world at this moment. Minjung
Buddhists accepted the latter, arguing that we can live in the Pure
Land when we strive to overcome the contradictions of society and
individuals. Through Minjung Buddhism, Korean Buddhists envisioned a
social revolution.</p>

<p>
After the democratization of South Korea in 1987, the Minjung Buddhist
movement gradually waned. Most of its members transformed the movement
into a more socially accessible form known as &ldquo;practical
Buddhism&rdquo; (K. <em>silch&rsquo;&#335;n Pulgyo</em>), which later
evolved into &ldquo;socially engaged Buddhism&rdquo; (K.
<em>ch&rsquo;amy&#335; Pulgyo</em>). They have led environmental
protection, Korean unification, and other social movements. The
philosophy of Minjung Buddhism became the theoretical foundation for
socially engaged Buddhism, which is rooted in the belief that
individuals are the agents of societal change and that people&rsquo;s
creative actions can transform the world.</p>

<p>
Two notable groups actively involved in social issues blend these
principles with traditional Buddhist philosophy: The Jungto Society
and Indra&rsquo;s Net Community. The Jungto Society adopted the
Minjung Buddhists&rsquo; objective of creating the Pure Land in the
current world. However, the Jungto Society does not focus on political
revolution; instead, its primary concerns are individual happiness and
a harmonious world based on non-dualistic Buddhist philosophy.
Meanwhile, the Indra&rsquo;s Net Community embraces the Hwa&#335;m
philosophy of an interconnected world, encapsulated in the idea that
&ldquo;one is all, and all is one,&rdquo; as appeared in
&#364;isang&rsquo;s <em>Ocean Seal Chart</em>. The metaphor of
Indra&rsquo;s net implies the teaching that all beings are
interconnected. As such, the Indra&rsquo;s Net Community concentrates
on restoring the connection between people and the earth through
ecological movements and care for all life forms on earth.</p>

<h3 id="WomKorBudPhi">5.3 Women and Korean Buddhist Philosophy</h3>

<p>
In the modern era, women struggled for gender equality and sought
liberation from a patriarchal society. Kim Iry&#335;p
(1896&ndash;1971), a leading figure among the &ldquo;New Woman&rdquo;
(K. <em>siny&#335;s&#335;ng</em>) of her time, actively confronted
these issues and discovered profound insights within S&#335;n
Buddhism. Prior to her life as a Buddhist nun, she gained recognition
as a prominent writer and female intellectual and was deeply involved
in the women&rsquo;s movement. Following her ordination as a nun, she
wholeheartedly dedicated herself to Buddhist practice and philosophy,
while she was not explicitly engaging in the women&rsquo;s movement
during that time. Her explorations nevertheless delved into
women&rsquo;s issues at a more fundamental level (J. Park 2017b).
Nearly three decades after she joined the monastery, she published
three books, including <em>Reflections of a Zen Buddhist Nun,</em> and
rekindled her connection with society. In her publications, she
skillfully applied traditional S&#335;n teachings to address her
search for the authentic self and presented a novel approach to
philosophical inquiry.</p>

<p>
In her essay collections, Kim Iry&#335;p employed her personal
experiences as a foundation for philosophical contemplation,
interpreting them in the context of Buddhist teachings. Through her
life journey as a woman in a patriarchal society, she sought answers
to questions regarding human existence, identity, societal
constraints, and love.</p>

<p>
During her S&#335;n practice, Kim Iry&#335;p encountered the concept
of the &ldquo;great self,&rdquo; representing a universal existence
that transcended individual selves. She made a clear distinction
between the individual self, often referred to as the &ldquo;small
self,&rdquo; and the authentic self which she calls &ldquo;the great
self.&rdquo; The great self does not exist as an independent entity
but rather symbolizes the openness of the self. In the context of
gender-related issues, the &ldquo;small self&rdquo; represents the
confined &ldquo;I,&rdquo; constrained by societal gender norms,
whereas the &ldquo;great self&rdquo; epitomizes the liberated self,
free from societal restrictions. Before engaging with Buddhist
philosophy, Kim primarily focused on seeking liberation from social
norms. However, as a Buddhist nun, she transcended the binary
opposition between social restriction and freedom, attaining a deeper,
non-dualistic form of liberation rooted in spiritual insight.</p>

<p>
She also introduced the concept of &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; as the
pathway to liberation from the constricting small self and the embrace
of the expansive great self. This creativity is synonymous with each
person&rsquo;s original mind, which serves as the wellspring of
one&rsquo;s existence. Recognizing this original mind led to the
realization of becoming a &ldquo;complete being,&rdquo; someone whose
existence harmonized with the universe. Kim Iry&#335;p&rsquo;s
philosophy vividly illustrated how Buddhist teachings could serve as a
powerful tool for both personal and social transformation.</p>

<p>
Another noteworthy Buddhist nun, Daehaeng (1927&ndash;2012), the
founder of the Hanmaum Seon Center (<em>Hanma&#365;m
S&#335;nw&#335;n</em>), revolutionized traditional Buddhist practices
in response to the needs of people. She focused on healing
individuals, and she proposed &ldquo;one mind&rdquo; or
<em>hanma&#365;m</em> thought and <em>chuin&rsquo;gong</em> practice as
methods for healing. &ldquo;<em>Hanmaum</em>&rdquo; signifies the
concept of &ldquo;one Mind&rdquo; (K. <em>ilsim</em>), an alternative
expression of Buddha nature. Daehaeng posits that the One Mind
(<em>hanmaum</em>, &#54620;&#47560;&#51020;) is the source of all
existence&mdash;it permeates all beings, and all phenomena arise from
it. <em>Chuin&rsquo;gong</em> (&#51452;&#51064;&#44277;) refers to the
&ldquo;insubstantial doer,&rdquo; the individualized manifestation of the One Mind
within each person. Daehaeng teaches that practitioners should entrust
everything to <em>chuin&rsquo;gong</em>, which she identifies as the
true center and master of the self. To prevent misunderstandings of
<em>chuin&rsquo;gong</em> as a transcendental or external deity,
Daehaeng emphasizes its emptiness by altering the Chinese character
<em>gong</em> (&#20844;, &ldquo;master&rdquo;) to <em>gong</em>
(&#31354;, &ldquo;emptiness&rdquo;), thereby underscoring its
non-substantial and non-dual nature. <em>Chuin&rsquo;gong</em>
practice does not require formal seated meditation at designated times
or places; rather, practitioners are encouraged to call upon
<em>chuin&rsquo;gong</em> whenever the need arises. Because of its
simplicity and adaptability, this approach made the practice highly
accessible to ordinary people in their daily lives.</p>

<p>
Modern Korean women Buddhist philosophers like Kim Iry&#335;p and
Daehaeng have reshaped traditional Buddhist philosophy in the context
of modern and gender related issues and demonstrated the capacity of
Buddhist teachings to address existential questions, especially for
women. Their dedicated efforts have also contributed to the enrichment
of the tapestry of Korean Buddhist philosophy in modern times.</p>
