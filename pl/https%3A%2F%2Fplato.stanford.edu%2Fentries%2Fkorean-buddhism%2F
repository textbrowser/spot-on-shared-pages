<h1>Korean Buddhism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Sep 5, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Buddhism was introduced to the Korean Peninsula from China during the
Korean Three Kingdoms period. It first arrived in Kogury&#335;, a
kingdom on the northern end of the peninsula, in 372 CE and then in
Paekche, a kingdom on the southwest of the peninsula, in 384 CE. It
arrived in Shilla, a kingdom on the southeast of the peninsula, in 521
CE by way of Kogury&#335;. The influence of Chinese Buddhism on Korean
Buddhism cannot be treated lightly because Korea imported mostly
sinologized Buddhism, not Indian Buddhism. However, Korea added its
own color and historical and social context.</p>

<p>
Throughout history, Buddhism has significantly influenced the
worldview of the Korean people, instilling concepts such as karma and
the interconnectedness of all things. Korean Buddhist philosophers
place an emphasis on cultivating the power of the mind, underpinning
their teachings with the belief that the mind of every individual is
inherently the Buddha&rsquo;s mind. Nevertheless, their narratives
vary when addressing the dynamic tension between aristocratic and
populist Buddhism, the quest for personal enlightenment versus the
salvation of others, and the dichotomy of doctrinal study and
meditation practice.</p>

<h2 id="FirsBuddTeacIntrKore">1. First Buddhist Teachings Introduced to Korea</h2>

<p>
When Buddhism reached the Korean Peninsula, it encountered a spiritual
landscape dominated by indigenous shamanic religions and Confucian
ethics. The first major Buddhist teachings introduced in Korea were
the theory of Karma and the political ideas of Buddhism (Ko:
30&ndash;37). These core concepts resonated with the Korean people,
leading Buddhism to soon supplant the previous spiritual systems.</p>

<h3 id="TheoKarm">1.1 The Theory of Karma</h3>

<p>
Karma, an idea originating from Indian thought, is a cause-and-effect
principle explaining the workings of the world and human life. It is a
universal law that even deities cannot escape. The term Karma
translates into several Chinese words, each representing different
connotations of Karma in Buddhism. These are &ldquo;Comeuppance&rdquo;
(<em>yinguoyingbao</em>, &#22240;&#26524;&#25033;&#22577;),
&ldquo;Karma&rdquo; (<em>ye</em>, &#26989;), and &ldquo;Karmic
retribution&rdquo; (<em>yebao</em>, &#26989;&#22577;).
<em>Yinguoyingbao</em> represents the principle that good deeds earn
rewards and bad deeds earn punishments. <em>Ye</em> implies that every
thought, word, and action in human behavior yields a result, signaling
a Buddhist reinterpretation of Karma. <em>Yebao</em> refers to human
behavior and its results; typically the outcomes people experience in
this life due to actions in their past lives.</p>

<p>
The theory of Karma taught Korean people to recognize the connections
between actions and their consequences. Before the advent of Buddhism,
people generally believed that all events were the result of
unpredictable natural forces, and that nothing was within their
control. However, Buddhism introduced the concept of
individuals&rsquo; roles and influence in the world, portraying them
as active agents capable of significantly impacting their
surroundings, rather than passive entities entirely subject to natural
laws. This understanding of Karma became deeply embedded in the
worldview of the Korean people.</p>

<p>
Additionally, the theory of Karma introduced the concept of
transmigration. Before the arrival of Buddhism, it was commonly
believed that the realms of the living and the dead were distinct and
physically separated. Beings from one realm could exert spiritual
influence over the other, especially among family members.
Ancestors&rsquo; spirits were thought to be able to help or harm their
descendants in the world of the living, and descendants were believed
to be capable of aiding their ancestors in resting peacefully in the
realm of the dead. When a person dies, the spirit permanently departs
the world of the living, with no rebirth. However, Buddhism introduced
the idea of past and future lives through the process of rebirth,
proposing that individuals are continuously reborn into circumstances
determined by their past lives. The concept of Karma provided the
Korean people with a logical explanation for ethical behavior.</p>

<h3 id="PoliIdeaBudd">1.2 Political Ideas of Buddhism</h3>

<p>
The ruling class embraced Buddhism because it provided advanced
knowledge and ideas to fortify kingship. Specifically, during
Shilla&rsquo;s transition from tribal coalitions to a centralized
kingdom, King Chinh&#365;ng leveraged the concept of
<em>Chakravarti</em> to reinforce his kingship. <em>Chakravarti</em>
is the title of an ideal king in Buddhism, ruling by truth rather than
force. This term implies a king who turns the wheel of truth,
symbolizing limitless governing power. The king&rsquo;s vast governing
power is depicted through the rolling wheel on his castle. His right
to rule, earned through good Karma in a past life, is indestructible.
Under his reign, peace and justice are assured for all. For instance,
if he were to go to war, he would achieve a bloodless victory as the
enemy would surrender upon seeing the aura of the wheel leading the
army.</p>

<p>
The <em>Chakravarti</em> concept supported the appointment of a king
over a tribal coalition to ensure stability. Furthermore, the people
equated a king with Maitreya, the world&rsquo;s savior Buddha.
Buddhism was perceived as more rational and potent than indigenous
belief systems, enabling Buddhist kings to make shamans and political
rivals submit more easily. Such political thoughts significantly
strengthened kingship and centralized governments in the three
kingdoms.</p>

<h2 id="FlouBuddPhil">2. The Flourishing of Buddhist Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Upon Buddhism&rsquo;s advent in Korea, it was perceived as a
progressive ideological system and swiftly adopted by the Korean
populace. This adoption led to a more widespread belief in Buddhism
and deepened the study of Buddhist scriptures. In particular, the
scriptures from the M&#257;dhyamaka, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, and precepts
schools gained significant traction. Numerous theoretical schools such
as Sanlun, Shelun, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, and Niepan were explored
extensively (Huh 2005: 7). While Sanlun was a major stream in
Kogury&#335;, and Baekche, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School was the
primary Buddhist school in Shilla (Ko 1989:138). However, towards the
late Unified Shilla period (780&ndash;935CE), Huayan (K.
<em>Hwa&#335;m</em>) School eventually became the most influential
branch of Korean Buddhism.</p>

<h3 id="ImpaYogcScho">2.1 The impact of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School</h3>

<p>
The Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School, a major philosophical branch of
Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhism, proposes that all beings are simply
manifestations of consciousness. It investigates the workings of human
consciousness, the nature of human afflictions, and the transformation
of tainted consciousness to an untainted original form. According to
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra teachings, human consciousness exists at eight
levels: the first five correspond to the senses, the sixth to the
mind, the seventh to self-consciousness that creates the belief of
self from stored consciousness, and the eighth to the storehouse
consciousness storing the seeds of karma. Yog&#257;c&#257;ra practice
aims to purify all consciousness levels, transforming deluded
consciousness into wisdom.</p>

<p>
In China, the Dilun School and the Shelun School are the primary
schools that focus on Yog&#257;c&#257;ra scriptures. The former
studies <em>Treaties on Ten Buddhist Principles</em> (Ch.
<em>Shidijinglun</em>, &#21313;&#22320;&#32147;&#35542;; Skt.
<em>Da&#347;abh&#363;mikas&#363;tram</em>) and the Flower Garland
s&#363;tra, later developing into the Huayan School. The Shelun School
derives teachings from the <em>Discourse on the Perfection of
Consciousness-Only</em> (Ch. <em>Shedachenglun</em>,
&#25885;&#22823;&#20056;&#35542;; Skt.
<em>Mah&#257;y&#257;nasa&#7747;graha</em>). Zendi (&#30494;&#35558;,
499&ndash;569 CE), a key translator and scholar in the Shelun School,
introduced the concept of a ninth pure consciousness, a belief rooted
in the Buddha nature theory. He thought that the tainted eighth
consciousness and the purified consciousness were essentially
different, so they should be separately named.</p>

<p>
A Shilla monk W&#335;nkwang (&#22291;&#20809;, 542&ndash;640 CE)
studied Shelun philosophy in China before teaching it in Shilla. His
teachings emphasized the pure Buddha mind, urging followers of
Mah&#257;y&#257;na teachings to primarily practice faith and
understanding of the one real realm, their true mind, characterized by
purity, non-obstruction, and permanence. This one real realm is
referred to as the womb of Buddha (Ch. <em>Rulaicang</em>,
&#22914;&#20358;&#34255;; Skt. <em>Tath&#257;gatagarbha</em>) or the
ninth consciousness.</p>

<p>
After Xunzang (602&ndash;664 CE) introduced translations of new
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra scriptures from India, Korean monks wanted to learn
this new teaching from him. Shilla monk W&#335;nch&#365;k
(&#22291;&#28204;, 613&ndash;696 CE), who studied in China, tried to
reconcile both Xunzang&rsquo;s and Zendi&rsquo;s Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
teachings. Differently from Zendi, Xunzang did not posit the ninth
consciousness, leading to different paths to salvation in their
teachings. According to Zendi, all beings will achieve Buddhahood due
to the innate Buddha nature, but Xunzang made no such guarantee. While
rooted in Xunzang&rsquo;s teaching of only eight consciousnesses,
W&#335;nch&#365;k incorporated the concept of pure consciousness,
situating it within the eighth consciousness rather than outside it.
This view suggests the eighth consciousness is not entirely tainted as
it does contain pure elements. Despite being a follower of the new
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines, W&#335;nch&#365;k provided all sentient
beings with the opportunity to achieve Buddhahood.</p>

<p>
Renowned monks from Shilla, such as &#364;isang (&#32681;&#28248;,
625&ndash;702 CE) and W&#335;nhyo (&#20803;&#26313;, 617&ndash;686
CE), studied the teachings of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School. These
monks even sought to travel to China to learn from the famous monk
Xuanzang. W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s story of enlightenment, which occurred
en route to China, illustrates the significant impact
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra teachings had on him. When &#364;isang and
W&#335;nhyo reached a harbor to embark on their journey to China, they
were caught in a sudden downpour and sought refuge in a small cave.
During the night, W&#335;nhyo woke up feeling extremely thirsty. In
the darkness, he found a bowl of water nearby, drank from it, and felt
a sense of satisfaction. However, come daylight, he realized he had
drunk fetid water from a skull, which caused him to vomit. This
experience led W&#335;nhyo to question why the same water had tasted
satisfactory at night but made him sick in the morning when he
realized its true nature. He concluded that the water was the same,
but his mind had distinguished it as clean at night and dirty in the
morning. This realization&mdash;that everything is a creation of the
mind&mdash;prompted him to stay in Shilla, having experienced the
essential teaching of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra from Xunzang.</p>

<h3 id="HwamPhil">2.2 Hwa&#335;m Philosophy</h3>

<p>
The philosophy of Hwa&#335;m, which finds its roots in the Flower
Garland S&#363;tra, underwent diverse interpretations by Korean monks
&#364;isang and W&#335;nhyo. &#364;isang, who studied in China,
focused his efforts on Hwa&#335;m philosophy itself and established
the Korean Hwa&#335;m school. Through dedicated practice, he aspired
to achieve a state of non-discriminating cognition, enabling him to
grasp the profound teachings of the Flower Garland s&#363;tra
(Ch&rsquo;oe Y. 2015: 15&ndash;16). On the other hand, W&#335;nhyo
approached Hwa&#335;m philosophy from the perspective of the
<em>Awakening of Mah&#257;y&#257;na Faith</em>, acknowledging its
inclusive nature that harmonizes all Buddhist teachings without
contradictions. This perspective led him to develop his own unique
philosophy. Despite their different approaches, both &#364;isang and
W&#335;nhyo recognized the core Hwa&#335;m concepts of
&ldquo;dependent arising of the universe&rdquo; (<em>Fajieyuanqi</em>,
&#27861;&#30028;&#32227;&#36215;) and &ldquo;dependent arising from
original nature&rdquo; (<em>Xingqi</em>, &#24615;&#36215;).</p>

<h4 id="DepeArisUniv">2.2.1 Dependent arising of the universe</h4>

<p>
The principle of &ldquo;Dependent Arising of the Universe&rdquo;
outlines the essential nature of all existence. While the theory of
dependent arising initially explained only the relationships among
individual entities, the Hwa&#335;m School expanded this concept to
illustrate the relationship between the universe as a whole and its
individual parts. The school proposed that every individual being
constitutes a fragment of the universe, and reciprocally, the universe
permeates every individual entity. This profound doctrine is often
encapsulated by the phrase, &ldquo;one is all, and all is one&rdquo;.
&#364;isang saw equality in this teaching and strived to embody this
sense of equality and harmony within his own community, despite the
strictly stratified social structure of Shilla society at the time.
Notably, he offered equal opportunities to his students, irrespective
of their social class. In both interpretations, it is essential for
each individual to recognize and respect the interconnected nature of
all beings.</p>

<p>
Modern Korean scholars interpret &ldquo;one is all, and all is
one&rdquo; in two ways (Kim 1990: 216&ndash;218). In the 1970s,
historians suggested this concept was used to bolster the kingship of
the Shilla king. They saw the relationship between the king and his
subjects as analogous to the interconnectedness of the one and all
individual beings. In contrast, from the 1980s onward, Buddhist
scholars began interpreting this concept as an expression of the
inherent equality of all beings. They reasoned that the relationship
between the one and all inherently implies equality; this equilibrium
can only be sustained when all elements within the relationship are
balanced, which in turn requires that each being be considered equal.
Both groups also concurred that the principle of dependent arising of
the universe played a significant role in unifying people. This core
Hwa&#335;m philosophy has profoundly influenced the Korean mindset,
instilling the belief in the interconnected and interdependent nature
of existence.</p>

<h4 id="DepeArisOrigNatu">2.2.2 Dependent arising from original nature</h4>

<p>
The theory of dependent arising from original nature posits that all
phenomena arise from the original nature, often referred to as Buddha
nature. This Buddha nature is concealed within the human mind, yet it
often goes unrecognized due to human ignorance and delusion. This
philosophy is encapsulated in a phrase from the Flower Garland
S&#363;tra, &ldquo;All originates from the mind. The mind is the
world&rsquo;s painter&rdquo;. This belief&mdash;that the human mind
holds the Buddha mind, and that this mind can shape the
world&mdash;became a fundamental concept in Korean Buddhism.</p>

<p>
&#364;isang underscored this idea and emphasized spiritual practices
to aid individuals in recovering the original nature. He composed a
remarkable poem called the &ldquo;Seal-Diagram Symbolizing the Dharma
Realm of the One-Vehicle of the Avata&#7747;saka&rdquo;
(<em>Hwa&#335;mils&#365;ngp&#335;pkyeto</em>,
&#33775;&#22196;&#19968;&#20056;&#27861;&#30028;&#22294;) which
encapsulated the essential teachings of the Hwa&#335;m School. This
exceptional poem took on a distinctive shape, consisting of precisely
210 words intricately arranged in a maze-like form, symbolizing a
mandala. This distinctive shape bestowed an esoteric and magical
quality upon the words, enhancing their impact.</p>

<p>
Within the poem, &#364;isang depicted the world from the enlightened
perspective, encouraging readers to diligently practice to attain
enlightenment. It began by describing the entirety and tranquility of
the untainted original nature, and then explored how the world arises
interdependently from this very nature. When the mind attains its
original nature, it ceases to discriminate between beings, transcends
dualistic thoughts, relinquishes attachment to a self, and allows
everything to flow following the laws of dependent arising.</p>

<p>
The enlightened being who has fully realized the original nature
perceives connections even among opposites, comprehends the entirety
of the cosmos in a mustard seed, and recognizes boundless time in a
single moment. &#364;isang concluded his poem by stating,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Finally, seated on the throne of the Middle Way, Ultimate Reality,
From times long past he has not moved-hence his name is Buddha.
(McBride 2012a, 105)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The theory of dependent arising from original nature emphasizes that
all beings are manifestations of Buddha and have the potential to
attain Buddhahood.</p>

<h3 id="AwakFaitMahyOneMind">2.3 <em>Awakening of Faith in the Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em> and the One Mind</h3>

<p>
<em>The Awakening of Faith in the Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em>, one of the
most influential Buddhist scriptures in East Asia, had a significant
impact on W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s philosophy of One Mind. This scripture
expounds on the concept of the Tath&#257;gatagarbha, aiming to
reconcile the perspectives of the M&#257;dhyamaka and the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra schools. The primary difference between these
schools lies in their explanations of the nature of beings. All three
teachings concur that beings exist temporarily as a result of causes
and conditions, and none can be deemed to exist independently. The
M&#257;dhyamaka school posits that the nature of all beings is
emptiness, implying their lack of inherent permanence. On the other
hand, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra school argues that all beings manifest
through their storehouse consciousness, known as the eighth
consciousness. However, the Tath&#257;gatagarbha philosophy proposes
that all beings possess the seed of the Buddha within them. This
teaching later developed into the theory of Buddha nature.</p>

<p>
<em>The Awakening of Faith in the Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em> introduces
the concept of the One Mind (Ch. <em>yixin</em>; K. <em>ilsim</em>,
&#19968;&#24515;) as a unifying framework for discussions on the human
mind. According to this scripture, the One Mind encompasses all
terminologies that describe the original nature and is equated with
the mind of sentient beings. It is explained through two aspects and
three greatnesses (<em>sanda</em>, &#19977;&#22823;). The One Mind
embodies the aspects of suchness, aligning with the M&#257;dhyamaka
School&rsquo;s understanding of the original nature as emptiness. It
also encompasses the aspect of arising and ceasing, reflecting the
manifestation of the storehouse consciousness through causes and
conditions, in line with the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School&rsquo;s
understanding of the original nature. The three greatnesses represent
its essence, attributes, and function. This comprehensive
understanding of the One Mind provides a holistic perspective on the
nature of mind within the context of Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhism.</p>

<p>
Using the insights gained from <em>the Awakening of Faith in the
Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em>, W&#335;nhyo was able to answer his three
central questions that arose from studying Xunzang&rsquo;s
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra teachings: Can every being achieve enlightenment?
Between the M&#257;dhyamaka School and the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra School,
which holds more accuracy? Is the One Mind a vessel of purity,
impurity, or a composite of both? In response to the first question,
W&#335;nhyo maintained that all beings could achieve enlightenment,
given that the One Mind contains the pure Buddha nature, but there
could be rare exceptions. Regarding the second question, he considered
the teachings of the M&#257;dhyamaka School and the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
School to be equally valid since the <em>Awakening of Faith in the
Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em> integrates their doctrines. As for the third
question, he posited that the One Mind is inherently pure and
transcends linguistic definition, although it could provisionally be
described as a mixture of the tainted and the untainted.</p>

<p>
W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s responses to these questions led him to establish
his One Mind philosophy, a name reflecting the profound depth of the
involved concepts. &ldquo;One&rdquo; in this context denotes the One
Mind&rsquo;s transcendence over dualism, as it harmonizes all
discourses without contradictions. &ldquo;Mind&rdquo;, on the other
hand, implies that the One Mind possesses an indescribable
intelligence (T1844, 206c&ndash;207a). All beings originate from and
must return to the One Mind, marking it as an intrinsic part of all
phenomena. Within this framework, W&#335;nhyo systematically organized
all terms pertaining to the mind. He categorized the true nature of
all beings and the concept of suchness under the aspect of suchness.
Similarly, he assigned the Buddha nature, the storehouse
consciousness, the ninth pure consciousness, and the Buddha&rsquo;s
womb under the aspect of arising and ceasing (T1845, 227c).</p>

<p>
Therefore, in W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s One Mind philosophy, enlightenment
is the act of returning to the One Mind. This can be achieved through
the practice of the six paramitas&mdash;generosity, discipline,
patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom&mdash;or by
chanting to Amit&#257;bha with faith in the One Mind and the three
Buddhist treasures: the Buddha, his teachings, and the Buddhist
practitioners. To help more people return to the One Mind, W&#335;nhyo
suggested a practice of reciting the name of Amit&#257;bha,
particularly for the illiterate population. He wandered through towns,
reciting &ldquo;Namu Amitabul&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;I take refuge in
Amit&#257;bha&rdquo;) while tapping a wooden singing ball. The
philosophy of the One Mind acknowledges the coexistence of the pure
and impure minds within the One Mind. This insight underlines the
human mind&rsquo;s duality, containing both pure and impure aspects,
and highlights the necessity for its cultivation.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, W&#335;nhyo utilized the One Mind concept as a
foundational principle for harmony and reconciliation, from which he
developed his unique theory of reconciliation, known as
&ldquo;<em>Hwajaeng&rdquo;.</em></p>

<h3 id="RecoBuddDoct">2.4 Reconciling Buddhist Doctrines</h3>

<p>
Reconciling Buddhist doctrines (<em>Hwajaeng</em>, &#21644;&#35533;)
is a theory founded by W&#335;nhyo that represents a signature aspect
of Korean Buddhism. It seeks to harmonize disputes within Buddhist
doctrine, using key premises from the M&#257;dhyamaka School and the
Lotus s&#363;tra.</p>

<p>
The first premise is that all disputes arise from language. From his
studies within the M&#257;dhyamaka School, W&#335;nhyo recognized the
effects and limitations of language. This philosophy discerns two
levels of truth: the conventional truth expressed in words, and the
ineffable, ultimate truth. Language facilitates understanding, yet it
fails to capture things in their entirety. Hence, teachings
articulated through language cannot fully convey the complete truth of
Buddhism. The second premise posits that all Buddhist schools
encapsulate facets of Buddha&rsquo;s teachings, regardless of the
potential limitations of comprehension. This principle is inspired by
the famous Lotus s&#363;tra parable of the blind men and the elephant.
In this parable, blind men each touch a part of an elephant, leading
to varying interpretations of what the creature is. W&#335;nhyo
related this parable to Buddhist doctrinal disputes, viewing each
school as recognizing only part of Buddha&rsquo;s teachings while
insisting that their interpretation was the sole correct one. With
these principles as the foundation, W&#335;nhyo developed his
harmonization theory, known as &ldquo;<em>hwajaeng</em>&rdquo;,
advocating for non-attachment to any particular doctrine. Free from
polarization, he scrutinized each doctrine&rsquo;s internal validity
and legitimacy through a stance of non-obstruction, neither affirming
nor denying any. He saw doctrinal disputes from Buddha&rsquo;s higher
perspective, transforming them into diverse facets of a unified body
of teaching without any classification.</p>

<p>
Interpretations of W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s <em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy
have evolved over time in the historical context of Korea. The first
association of W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s name with the <em>hwajaeng</em>
concept was documented in the writings of &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n
(&#32681;&#22825;, 1055&ndash;1101 CE), who sought to unify Buddhist
doctrine and practice during the Kory&#335; dynasty. Under Japanese
occupation, W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s <em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy became
associated with Unified Buddhism (<em>Tongbulgyo</em>), a
characteristic unique to Korean Buddhism. This Unified Buddhism,
perceived as a complete form of Buddhism integrating all Buddhist
teachings, was employed to foster pride in Korean Buddhism by
positioning it above other regional Buddhist traditions. After the
liberation, the meaning of &ldquo;<em>hwajaeng</em>&rdquo; in Korea
has transitioned from &ldquo;unification&rdquo; to
&ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; mirroring the societal shift from an
authoritarian to a more pluralistic Korean society. In contemporary
times, W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s <em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy is suggested
as a potential remedy for conflict resolution and social
polarization.</p>

<h3 id="ArriSnBudd">2.5 Arrival of S&#335;n Buddhism</h3>

<p>
In the seventh century, S&#335;n (Ch. <em>Chan</em>, Jp. <em>Zen</em>)
Buddhism was introduced to the Shilla Kingdom. Instead of elaborate
rituals and complex doctrines, it offered a simple meditation
practice. Chan Buddhism put forward the idea of realizing Buddhahood,
which is the attainment of enlightenment. According to Chan Buddhism,
all sentient beings possess Buddha nature and have the potential to
become a Buddha. Buddha nature is not merely a seed of potential to
become a Buddha, but the true mind of all beings. Therefore, Mazu
Daoyi (709&ndash;788), the eighth patriarch in Chinese Chan, advocated
the belief that the &ldquo;Ordinary mind is the Way&rdquo; and
&ldquo;This mind is Buddha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Mazu S&#335;n found favor among the ruling provincial class
(<em>hojok</em>) in Shilla since the ninth century (Huh: 2005:
32&ndash;33). His teaching has notable similarities with the doctrinal
Huayan School, both of which were founded on the Tath&#257;gatagarbha
teaching and upheld the purity of the human mind. Mazu Chan emphasized
practice and sudden enlightenment, urging practitioners to see all
beings as manifestations of Buddha nature and their own minds as the
Buddha mind.</p>

<h2 id="BuddDuriKoryDyna">3. Buddhism During the Kory&#335; Dynasty</h2>

<p>
Throughout the Kory&#335; dynasty, Buddhism assimilated into Korean
culture, establishing its place in the people&rsquo;s everyday lives.
It embraced indigenous deity worship and adapted Buddhist rituals,
particularly by blending with mountain god worship. Performing rites
for life events&mdash;such as births, funerals, and ancestor
worship&mdash;became an integral function of Buddhism. However,
despite its crucial role in Korean society, Buddhism lost its dominant
status by the end of the Kory&#335; dynasty, with Neo-Confucianism
emerging as the preferred philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="UnifBuddTeac">3.1 Unification of Buddhist teachings</h3>

<p>
Two prominent monks proposed the way to unify Buddhist teachings,
especially between doctrinal school and S&#335;n Buddhism.
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n advocated for the harmony of doctrines and
practices and is known for achieving unification from a doctrinal
perspective. On the other hand, Chinul advocated for a S&#335;n
approach to unify practice and Hwa&#335;m doctrine.</p>

<h4 id="HarmDoctPrac1055CE">3.1.1 Harmonizing doctrine and practice&mdash;&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n (&#32681;&#22825;, 1055&ndash;1101 CE)</h4>

<p>
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n, who studied Hwa&#335;m (Ch. Huayan) and
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae (Ch. Tiantai; Jp. Tendai) Buddhism in Korea
and China, established the Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae school in
Kory&#335;. His arguments for harmonization drew from the teachings of
Chengguan (738&ndash;839 CE), W&#335;nhyo, and Zongmi (780&ndash;841
CE).</p>

<p>
Upon his return from China, &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n observed that the
teachings of Hwa&#335;m and Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae bore
considerable similarities and explored the shared elements between
them. Influenced by Chengguan, he proposed that the taxonomies used by
both schools were identical (Lee 2002: 153&ndash;155). While Tiantai
classified Buddhist teachings into five periods and eight teachings,
Huayan divided them into five teachings. Tiantai&rsquo;s
classification integrated three standard categorizations. The fifth
period is based on the evolving times of teaching. One pair of the
four teachings was categorized by teaching method, the other by
content type. Chengguan compared Huayan&rsquo;s five teachings and
Tiantai&rsquo;s four teachings by content type and pointed out that
Huayan&rsquo;s five teachings included an additional one: the sudden
enlightenment doctrine. Except for this additional teaching, the
classifications used by both schools matched. While Tiantai&rsquo;s
taxonomy did not explicitly include the sudden enlightenment doctrine,
as it was already incorporated in its teachings, the Huayan school
emphasized Chan practice in its classification.
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n also linked Hwa&#335;m&rsquo;s three
contemplations to the taxonomy, arguing that both schools proposed
that all phenomena were interconnected, and the entire world could be
perceived in all phenomena.</p>

<p>
Although &#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n initially advocated for the study of
various Buddhist doctrines, he did not imply that all teachings were
equally beneficial for study. Later, influenced by W&#335;nhyo&rsquo;s
<em>hwajaeng</em> philosophy, his perspective evolved, and he sought
to harmonize all Buddhist teachings and treat them with equal regard.
Upon establishing the Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae school,
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n introduced W&#335;nhyo as Korea&rsquo;s first
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae scholar and extolled him as the master of
<em>hwajaeng</em>. He also recognized Chegwan (&#35558;&#35264;, died
970 CE) as the second Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae scholar. A Kory&#335;
monk who had studied in China, Chegwan wrote an influential
introductory book on the Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae school,
<em>Essentials of the Four Stages of Teaching of
Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae</em> (<em>Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae
sagyo&#365;i</em>, &#22825;&#21488;&#22235;&#25934;&#20736;),
summarizing the core teachings of Ch&rsquo;&#335;nt&rsquo;ae.</p>

<p>
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n considered Zongmi as the epitome of
reconciling doctrinal teaching and S&#335;n practice perfectly. He
believed that the S&#335;n and doctrinal schools held equal importance
and were compatible. While the S&#335;n school eschewed language, the
doctrinal schools embraced it. These contrasting stances had their
respective merits and flaws, rendering them complementary.
Furthermore, adopting Zongmi&rsquo;s perspective,
&#364;ich&rsquo;&#335;n sought commonalities between Confucianism and
Daoism. Despite their differences with Buddhism, he observed that all
three philosophies addressed filial piety. Consequently, he sought to
harmonize these philosophies under a single system, scrutinizing their
shared idea.</p>

<h4 id="RecoMediDoct1158">3.1.2 Reconciling meditation and doctrine&mdash;Chinul (&#30693;&#35365;, 1158&ndash;1210)</h4>

<p>
Chinul, one of the most influential Buddhist philosophers in Korea,
pursued a reconciliation of meditation and doctrine by identifying
their shared ground. He considered meditation, namely S&#335;n, and
doctrine, specifically Hwa&#335;m teaching, as two distinct pathways
leading to enlightenment.</p>

<p>
Chinul&rsquo;s approach to unifying practice and doctrine was inspired
by Zongmi, although he developed his own variations. Zongmi
categorized Chan Buddhism and doctrinal Buddhism into three levels
each and unified them on each level. In other words, the first level
of Chan aligned with the first level of doctrinal school, and so
forth. Contrarily, Chinul did not adhere to this three-tiered
classification of S&#335;n Buddhism. Instead, he categorized S&#335;n
Buddhism based on whether it discussed sudden enlightenment, resulting
in two classification levels. Then, he unified only the practice based
on sudden enlightenment and the doctrine of perfect teachings. This
was because both incorporated two ways of explaining enlightenment:
the negative way and the affirmative way. The negative way outlined
the limits of language and thought and revealed the nature of the
mind. The affirmative way perceived the mind as the essence of all
beings and demonstrated the mind&rsquo;s role in creating things
through dependent origination. While Zongmi used these approaches to
explain doctrinal teachings, Chinul employed them to harmonize
S&#335;n and perfect teaching. S&#335;n Buddhism primarily employs the
negative way to challenge the boundaries of thought and the positive
way to emphasize the potency of the mind&rsquo;s nature. Perfect
teaching, particularly the <em>Xingqi</em> theory in Hwa&#335;m,
elucidated the tranquil nature and its dependent origination of all
beings. Essentially, Chinul found that the <em>Xingqi</em> in
Hwa&#335;m teachings aligned with the S&#335;n teaching that each
individual&rsquo;s mind is the Buddha&rsquo;s mind. Based on this
discovery, he proposed that doctrinal teaching represented the word of
Buddha while meditational teaching embodied the mind of Buddha.</p>

<p>
In Kory&#335; Buddhism, Buddhist philosophers consistently sought to
integrate opposing teachings into a unified understanding of Buddhism.
This unification process blurred the lines among Buddhist schools in
Korea and, along with the political context of the time, contributed
to the gradual unification of Korean Buddhism.</p>

<h3 id="FormKoreSnBudd">3.2 The Formation of Korean S&#335;n Buddhism</h3>

<p>
During the mid-Kory&#335; Dynasty, Chinul introduced a new form of
practice called Kanhwa S&#335;n, which became the primary practice in
Korean S&#335;n Buddhism. Considered the founder of the Chogye Order,
the most significant Buddhist sect in contemporary Korea,
Chinul&rsquo;s practice embodied several characteristics. Key among
these were the concepts of &ldquo;void and calm, numinous
awareness&rdquo; (K.<em>Kongj&#335;ky&#335;ngji</em>,
&#31354;&#23490;&#38728;&#30693;), &ldquo;sudden enlightenment
followed by gradual cultivation&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;dual practice
of sam&#257;dhi and praj&ntilde;&#257;na
(K.<em>Ch&#335;nghyessangsu</em>,
&#23450;&#24935;&#38617;&#20462;)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
S&#335;n Buddhism asserts that Buddha nature represents the true self
of all beings, thus advocating for the realization of one&rsquo;s
nature, or in other words, &ldquo;seeing your true self.&rdquo; In
this context, individuals have a personal self, but beyond that, there
exists a real self, identified as suchness or Buddha. The Buddha mind
is regarded as one&rsquo;s nature, therefore all human perceptions and
actions can be seen as manifestations of the Buddha nature. This
teaching provides hope for universal salvation, but it simultaneously
poses a question: why can&rsquo;t ordinary people perceive the Buddha
nature? In his work <em>Secrets on Cultivating the Mind</em>
(<em>Susimkyy&#335;l</em>, &#20462;&#24515;&#35363;), Chinul provided
an answer: just as we cannot see our own body, we cannot perceive the
Buddha nature because we are immersed in it and it resides within us
(Chinul SW: 208). This Buddha nature is recognized through &ldquo;the
mind of void and calm, numinous awareness.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;void
and calm&rdquo; suggests that the mind is insubstantial and reflects
all things, similar to a placid lake. &ldquo;Numinous awareness&rdquo;
involves self-contemplation, illumination of the Buddha nature, and
the ability to respond to the interconnected world. The concept
&ldquo;the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness&rdquo;
corresponds to the subjective aspect of the Buddha mind, while the
objective aspect is associated with Buddha nature. While these are not
existentially divided, they are conceptually separated in the context
of the principle of dependent origination. This pure and authentic
mind is also referred to as the &ldquo;original face&rdquo; (K.
<em>pollae my&#335;nmok</em>, &#26412;&#20358;&#38754;&#30446;) in the
S&#335;n tradition. When compared to Zongmi&rsquo;s concept of
&ldquo;original enlightenment and true mind&rdquo; (Ch.
<em>Benjuezhenxin</em>, 
<span class="nw">&#26412;&#35258;&#30494;&#24515;</span>) referring to
the pure mind, the terminology used by Chinul offers a more detailed
portrayal of the characteristics of the true mind.</p>

<p>
The debate between sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation was a
pivotal discussion in Chan Buddhism. Advocates from the Southern Chan
school argued for sudden enlightenment, claiming that this immediate
insight was sufficient, and no additional cultivation was required.
Conversely, the Northern Chan school supported the practice of gradual
cultivation, considering the human mind to be inherently pure but
enshrouded by defilement that necessitated gradual removal for
enlightenment. Chinul, adopting Zongmi&rsquo;s approach, advocated for
a dual practice of sudden enlightenment followed by gradual
cultivation. He suggested that gradual cultivation after sudden
enlightenment is necessary to prevent habitual actions&rsquo;
recurrence and thoroughly eliminate defilements. He defined true
cultivation as a process of cultivation without cultivating anything
(Chinul SW: 227). This implies that, after sudden enlightenment, one
realizes that deluded thoughts are essentially void, leaving no
tangible defilement to be removed. Consequently, the cultivation
process progresses without attachment, meaning the practitioner
cultivates without clinging to the idea of eradication.</p>

<p>
Chinul emphasized the dual practice of sam&#257;dhi and
praj&ntilde;&#257;na, the two pillars of meditation. Sam&#257;dhi, or
concentration meditation, guides the mind into a calm state, while
praj&ntilde;&#257;na, or insight meditation, enables the mind to see
things as they truly are. Without sam&#257;dhi, insight cannot
perceive things clearly, and without praj&ntilde;&#257;na,
concentration cannot entirely eradicate defilements. Additionally, he
expanded their interpretations, linking sam&#257;dhi to S&#335;n
practice and praj&ntilde;&#257;na to doctrinal teaching, thereby
fusing S&#335;n and Hwa&#335;m in his practice. He further
corresponded those practices to the essence and function (Chinul SW:
230). The essence is sam&#257;dhi and the function is
praj&ntilde;&#257;na. As essence and function are inseparable, so
those two practices are inseparable, too. The balance between these
two practices was pivotal in Chinul&rsquo;s teaching, as demonstrated
by his three approaches to S&#335;n practice: &ldquo;equal maintenance
of quiescence and alertness&rdquo; (K.
<em>s&#335;ngj&#335;kt&#365;ngji</em>,
&#24826;&#23490;&#31561;&#25345;), &ldquo;faith and understanding
according to the complete and sudden teaching&rdquo; (K.
<em>w&#335;ndonshinhae</em>, &#22291;&#38931;&#20449;&#35299;), and
&ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; (K. <em>ky&#335;ngj&#335;l</em>,
&#24465;&#25130;). &ldquo;Equal maintenance of quiescence and
alertness&rdquo; refers to the dual practice of Sam&#257;dhi and
praj&ntilde;&#257;na. &ldquo;Faith and understanding according to the
complete and sudden teaching&rdquo; connected to the equal practice of
S&#335;n and Hwa&#335;m&rsquo;s doctrinal teaching. Complete teaching
refers to Hwa&#335;m teaching, and sudden teaching is S&#335;n. The
shortcut is Kanhwa S&#335;n (Ch. Kanhua Chan,
&#30475;&#35441;&#31146;) practice, leading to enlightenment
directly.</p>

<p>
Originating from Dahui zonggao (1089&ndash;1163), Kanhua Chan practice
concentrates on <em>gongan</em> (K. <em>kongan</em>, Jp.
<em>k&#333;an</em>), words extracted from Chan dialogues. When
implemented in practice, <em>gongan</em> is referred to as
<em>huatou</em> (K. <em>hwadu</em>, Jp. <em>wat&#333;</em>). In his
<em>Treatise on Resolving Doubt About Observing the Keyword</em>
(<em>Kanhwak y&#335;l&#365;ilon</em>
&#30475;&#35441;&#27770;&#30097;&#35542;), Chinul advocated for this
practice, deeming it the most effective way to liberate from the
maladies in the conceptual understanding of the Buddhist truth (Chinul
SW: 317). Even though doctrinal principles convey profound and sublime
teachings, they are nonetheless constrained by language. The S&#335;n
tradition recognizes the limitations of language, which naturally
creates a dichotomy between subject and object, leading to a dualistic
framework. Chinul was aware of this dichotomy and distinguished
between two aspects of hwadu: investigating the meaning (K.
<em>ch&rsquo;am&#365;i</em>, &#21443;&#24847;) and investigating the
word (K. <em>ch&rsquo;amgu</em>, &#21443;&#21477;). Investigating the
meaning involves interpreting hwadu within a doctrinal context, while
investigating the word utilizes <em>hwadu</em> to liberate oneself
from conceptual knowledge. These two methods are also related to two
types of <em>hwadu</em>, namely, the living word (K. <em>hwalgu</em>)
and the dead word (K. <em>sagu</em>). The living word facilitates the
practitioner&rsquo;s return to the original state of emptiness, thus
freeing them from the preconceived notions created by linguistic
structures. Conversely, the dead word represents the opposite
process.</p>

<p>
Chinul&rsquo;s practice framework predominantly rests on the principle
of sudden enlightenment, understood as the realization of one&rsquo;s
Buddha nature. To engage in this practice, a practitioner should first
firmly believe in their inherent Buddhahood. Following this, the
Kanhwa S&#335;n practice enables practitioners to experience the
Buddha within themselves, leading to gradual cultivation. This
grounding in the balance of two forms of meditation allows
practitioners to perceive the two facets of Buddha nature: its
calmness and its colorful arising. This gradual cultivation aims to
eliminate defilements completely. Since Chinul&rsquo;s time, this
approach combining sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation, with
the addition of Kanhwa S&#335;n practice as a shortcut, has been
considered the standard practice in Korean S&#335;n Buddhism. This
synthesis is the hallmark of Chinul&rsquo;s practice system.</p>

<p>
During the Kory&#335; dynasty, Korean Buddhism blurred its boundaries
by unifying various Buddhist teachings in one system, and Korean
S&#335;n Buddhism finished forming its theoretical system and
characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="ConvBetwBuddNeoConfChosDyna">4. Conversations between Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism in the Chos&#335;n Dynasty</h2>

<p>
The Chos&#335;n Dynasty marked a challenging period for Korean
Buddhism. The ruling Neo-Confucian scholars criticized and suppressed
Buddhism for its perceived corruption and its teachings that opposed
Confucian values. In response, Buddhists emphasized the similarities
between Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism and embraced Confucian ethics,
including principles of loyalty and filial piety.</p>

<h3 id="CritDefeBudd">4.1 Critique and Defense of Buddhism</h3>

<p>
Criticism of Buddhism from Neo-Confucian scholars began in the late
Kory&#335; Dynasty when corruption within Buddhism started to be taken
seriously. A notable critic was Ch&#335;ng Toj&#335;n (1342&ndash;1398
CE), a founding figure of the Chos&#335;n Dynasty. In his work <em>An
Array of Critiques of Buddhism</em> (<em>Pulssi jappy&#335;n</em>,
&#20315;&#27663;&#38620;&#36776;), he voiced his objections to both
the philosophy and practices of Buddhism. In response to these
critiques, Buddhist monk Hamh&#335; T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong
(&#28085;&#34395;&#24471;&#36890;, 1376&ndash;1433 CE) penned <em>The
Exposition of Orthodoxy</em> (<em>Hy&#335;nj&#335;ngnon</em>,
&#39023;&#27491;&#35542;), aiming to address misunderstandings about
Buddhism among Neo-Confucian scholars. While they never directly
debated, these two works highlight the points of contention and
defense regarding Buddhism during the Chos&#335;n Dynasty.</p>

<p>
Ch&#335;ng believed Buddhist philosophy is inherently illogical, and
its religious practice hurts Confucian values. His criticisms extended
to various aspects of Buddhist doctrines, including transmigration,
Karma, mind and nature, and ethical principles.</p>

<p>
Regarding the concept of transmigration, Ch&#335;ng argued from a
Confucian perspective that once the soul combines with Yin and Yang
and separates into heaven and earth after death, it can never reunite,
rendering rebirth impossible. He used the analogy of water drawn from
a well, which, once taken, cannot return to the well. Additionally,
Ch&#335;ng challenged the concept of transmigration by stating that,
if it were true, the number of beings in the world would always be the
same, while the total number of lives changes in real-world
circumstances. In discussing the causes and effects of Karma, he
argued that people&rsquo;s fortune and misfortune are decided by
timing, not only by cause and effect. He likened this to the process
of making liquor, which only develops a good taste when the mixture of
ingredients has had sufficient time to ferment.</p>

<p>
Ch&#335;ng also highlights the inconsistency within Buddhist teachings
concerning the relationship between the mind and the nature (K.
<em>s&#335;ng</em>, &#24615;). From his Neo-Confucian perspective,
nature represents the principle given by heaven, while mind is formed
by material force (K. <em>ki</em>) encompassing both nature and
emotion (K. <em>j&#335;ng</em>). With this foundation, he criticizes
Buddhism for its perceived internal contradiction in equating the mind
with nature. He began by pointing out conflicting definitions of these
concepts within Buddhist scriptures, where the mind and nature were
both equated and differentiated. Delusion was associated with the
mind, while awakening was linked to nature. Ch&#335;ng also took issue
with phrases such as &ldquo;Observe the mind and see nature&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Mind is none other than nature&rdquo; (Ch&#335;ng CB: 60)
arguing that they created a logical fallacy similar to attempting to
eat one&rsquo;s own mouth.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Ch&#335;ng criticized two Buddhist arguments:
&ldquo;functional activity is the nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;mind and
its trace&rdquo;. S&#335;n Buddhist masters would assert that all
human activities were manifestations of the Buddha nature. Ch&#335;ng
questioned this perspective, suggesting that if one accepted
Buddhism&rsquo;s idea, then acts such as killing others could be
labeled as the functional activity of nature. In his Neo-Confucian
philosophy, nature represented a pure moral principle-centered in
mind, which interacted with external stimuli. Therefore, he believed
that Buddhism&rsquo;s argument was flawed. Regarding the concept of
the mind and its trace, he critiqued Buddhism for separating them,
citing a Buddhist sentence: &ldquo;If the bodhisattva
Ma&ntilde;ju&#347;r&#299; wanders taverns, his behavior is wrong, but
his mind is right&rdquo; (Ch&#335;ng CB: 64, 121). In his perspective,
the mind equated to essence (K. <em>che</em>) and trace represented
function (K. <em>yong</em>), making them inseparable.</p>

<p>
Ch&#335;ng also offers a critique of the metaphysical foundations of
Buddhism. Citing Buddhist teachings that state, &ldquo;Good and evil
are from mind. The myriad of phenomena is nothing but
consciousness&rdquo;, he argues that this viewpoint portrays the
phenomenal world as an illusory creation of consciousness and mind,
devoid of a solid foundation. Consequently, he asserts that such a
perspective hinders the objective assessment of good or bad behavior
based on moral principles called nature.</p>

<p>
In terms of Buddhist practice, Ch&#335;ng, along with other Confucian
scholars, thinks that Buddhism&rsquo;s promotion of renunciation of
familial ties and indiscriminate compassion were particularly
problematic. Monks&rsquo; abandonment of their families and their
celibacy contradicted Confucian values, which placed great importance
on marriage and procreation as forms of filial piety. Additionally,
Buddhism&rsquo;s universal compassion conflicted with
Confucianism&rsquo;s emphasis on distinguishing between family and
others. Ch&#335;ng also pointed out that monks, in their
indiscriminate compassion, were even willing to sacrifice their bodies
to leopards, behavior that he considered a violation of the practice
of filial piety. In summary, Ch&#335;ng Toj&#335;n&rsquo;s critique
aimed to reveal weaknesses in the Buddhist moral framework.</p>

<p>
In defense of Buddhism, Hamh&#335; T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong maintained that
Buddhism and Confucianism were not fundamentally different. Regarding
the topics of transmigration and karma, Hamh&#335; emphasized that
these teachings motivate individuals to willingly engage in good
actions rather than bad ones. Additionally, these teachings promote
the importance of emotional control, which fosters self-discipline and
encourages virtuous deeds.</p>

<p>
While he did not directly comment on the relationship between the mind
and nature, he viewed the mind as more than just an illusory empty
entity; instead, he saw it as an active and luminous entity, somewhat
akin to the Confucian concept of &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo;, which is
a characteristic of one&rsquo;s nature. He also explained the
interplay between nature and emotion as a relationship between essence
and function. According to his perspective, nature and emotion are
distinct, with a deluded nature giving rise to emotions. Much like
Neo-Confucian scholars, he regarded nature as the pure aspect and
emotions as the impure aspect that arises in relation to external
stimuli.</p>

<p>
When addressing practical ethical issues such as monk celibacy and
universal compassion, Hamh&#335; argued that the choice of monkhood
could provide significant benefits not only to the monks themselves
but also to their parents, family members, and even the nation. He
contended that it represented the highest form of practicing filial
piety and loyalty. Additionally, he equated Confucian virtues,
including benevolence, justice, propriety, wisdom, and trust, with
Buddhism&rsquo;s precepts against killing, theft, sexual misconduct,
alcohol consumption, and lying. Hamh&#335; T&#365;kt&rsquo;ong&rsquo;s
approach to reconciling Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism continued to
exert influence on Buddhist philosophy in Chos&#335;n.</p>

<h3 id="HarmBuddConf">4.2 Harmonizing Buddhism and Confucianism</h3>

<p>
During the later period of the Chos&#335;n Dynasty, the discourse
seeking harmony between Buddhism and Confucianism gained more
popularity. Although Confucian scholars recognized the similarities
between the two&mdash;both addressing the nature of the mind and
advocating for a simple life&mdash;they maintained criticisms of
Buddhism. During this period of Buddhist suppression, a monk named
H&#335;&#365;ngdang Bowoo (&#34395;&#25033;&#22530; &#26222;&#38632;
died 1565 CE), who was instrumental in Buddhism&rsquo;s restoration,
endeavored to harmonize the two philosophies. He equated Buddhist
teachings with other teachings through the Flower Garland s&#363;tra,
asserting that both Confucianism and Daoism were applications of this
s&#363;tra. Bowoo attempted to explain Buddhist teaching through
Confucian concepts and views in his book, <em>The Treaties of One
Rightness (Ilch&#335;ngnon</em>, &#19968;&#27491;&#35542;). The title,
&ldquo;One,&rdquo; signifies the origin of all beings and the cause of
all change, correlating with the principle of heaven in
Neo-Confucianism. All beings exist by obtaining the principle of
heaven, which also facilitates the changes of the four seasons.
&ldquo;Rightness&rdquo; refers to the pure, untainted mind of Buddhism
and the right status of the human mind according to Confucianism. This
righteous state encompasses Confucian elements of morality: the sense
of compassion, shame, respect, and the discernment of right and wrong.
Here, &ldquo;One&rdquo; also represents the world, and
&ldquo;Rightness&rdquo; implies the human mind. Consequently, Bowoo
asserts that these two become one, resulting in a unity of the world
and the human mind. He expanded his argument by acknowledging that
even though the human mind is connected to the principle of heaven, it
is still influenced by material force, which can tarnish the human
mind. Thus, he proposed the practice of Confucian methods such as
reverence and extending knowledge as a means of purification.</p>

<p>
Commonly, the concept of mind, nature, principle, and supreme ultimate
(Ch. <em>taiji</em>; K. <em>t&rsquo;aeg&#365;k</em>) were employed to
compare the two teachings. Over time, both Confucian scholars and
Buddhist monks agreed on the similarity of the two teachings
concerning mind cultivation and self-discipline. Although Buddhism was
suppressed during this period, friendships between Confucian scholars
and Buddhist monks led to mutual studies and deeper understanding.</p>

<h2 id="RespKoreBuddModeTime">5. The Response of Korean Buddhism to Modern Times</h2>

<p>
In modern times, Koreans encountered Western philosophy and
Christianity. This encounter led to an assumption that traditional
Asian elements, including Buddhism, might be considered irrelevant on
the path to modern nationhood. Modernization in Korea was frequently
synonymous with Westernization. Faced with this shift in perspective,
Korean intellectuals embarked on a reevaluation of Buddhism&rsquo;s
role in a modern, Western-influenced society.</p>

<p>
In pursuit of this reevaluation, they posed several crucial questions:
Is Buddhism worthy of preservation? To what genre does Buddhism belong
in Western academic classification? What are the similarities and the
differences between Buddhism and Western thought? How can Buddhist
philosophy contribute to the future world?</p>

<p>
Moreover, the colonial and postcolonial reality significantly
influenced the perception and development of modern Korean Buddhism,
prompting greater engagement with social issues than during the
Chos&#335;n period.</p>

<h3 id="InveValuBuddPhilModeEra">5.1 Investigating the value of Buddhist philosophy in the modern era</h3>

<h4 id="PlacBuddWestInteCont">5.1.1 Placing Buddhism in the western intellectual context</h4>

<p>
Korean Buddhists, much like other East Asian Buddhist intellectuals,
have undertaken efforts to interpret Buddhism within the framework of
Western thought. One of the issues they grapple with is the
differentiation between religion and philosophy in Western discourse,
a distinction that does not exist in Eastern discourse. Consequently,
East Asian Buddhist intellectuals, including Koreans, have proposed
that Buddhism encompasses both religious and philosophical elements.
Depending on the individual intellectuals, they may have differing
perspectives on these two aspects of Buddhism.</p>

<p>
For instance, Paek Yongs&#335;ng, a Buddhist monk and reformer, places
emphasis on Buddhism as a religion. Han Yongun (1879&ndash;1944), a
writer and reformer, directs his focus toward its philosophical
elements. Yi Jongch&rsquo;&#335;n, a scholar who studied under Inoue
Enry&#333; at Tokyo University, regards the doctrinal teachings of
Buddhism as philosophical elements, while considering the practice of
Buddhism as the religious component (Yi 1918: 35&ndash;36). On the
other hand, Paek S&#335;nguk, the first Korean to study philosophy in
Germany, argues that Buddhism is a religion founded on philosophy. In
his article titled &ldquo;Buddhist Metaphysics,&rdquo; he asserts that
Buddhism is philosophy because it objectively studies truth obtained
from reality, and it is religion because it involves the worship of
various deities (Paek 1925: 21&ndash;22).</p>

<p>
In the late 1910s and the 1920s, Korean Buddhist philosophers, under
the influence of Inoue Enry&#333; (&#20117;&#19978; &#20870;&#20102;
1858&ndash;1919), began to view Buddhist philosophy as metaphysics.
Inoue, the most influential philosopher for East Asian intellectuals
at the time, described Buddhist philosophy as pure philosophy,
examining the essence of the universe and the principles of truth,
aligning with German idealism. Consequently, Korean Buddhist
philosophers delved into metaphysical issues, such as the relationship
between phenomena (<em>dharma</em>) and the actual reality of all
phenomena (suchness, Skt. <em>Bh&#363;tako&#7789;i</em>). The term
&ldquo;actual reality of all phenomena&rdquo; corresponds to the
concept of essence in Western philosophy. In the context of Buddhist
philosophy, it refers to truth, the ultimate culmination for all
beings and a representation of things as they are. Kim
Ch&rsquo;&#335;lu, a Buddhist scholar, explores the non-dualism within
Buddhist metaphysics. Kim asserts,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Buddhism&rsquo;s primary principle is that phenomena are the actual
reality of all phenomena. Less developed religions separate the actual
reality of phenomena from phenomena, thus failing to explain the
relationship between the actual reality of phenomena and human beings.
Buddhism, as an advanced religion, proposes the unity of phenomena and
the actual reality of phenomena, elucidating that all phenomena
constitute the actual reality of phenomena. (Kim 1919: 53)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Furthermore, Paek S&#335;nguk delves into the dynamic tension within
the actual reality of phenomena, which conveys the concept of Buddha
as the ultimate universal truth. This universal truth can be dissected
into object and subject when examined in relation to dharma. In this
context, Buddha serves as the inherent subject in the truth, and this
perspective stands in contrast to that of Nishida Kitaro
(&#35199;&#30000;&#24190;&#22810;&#37086;, 1870&ndash;1945), a
prominent philosopher of the Kyoto school. Nishida highlights the
concept of absolute emptiness that transcends divisions between
subjects and objects, asserting that it is the only reality where
separated beings can unite.</p>

<h4 id="AligBuddPhilModeThou">5.1.2 Aligning Buddhist Philosophy with Modern Thought</h4>

<p>
During this era, social evolution theory emerged as a prevailing
intellectual trend, asserting that all cultures must progress, and
only those that advance and adapt can survive. In this context, Han
Yongun took on the challenge of demonstrating the relevance of
Buddhism by identifying its modern elements. He discovered thoughts of
free will and egalitarianism in Buddhist teachings and argued that
Buddhism held the potential to contribute to a better world than
social evolution theory would.</p>

<p>
Drawing inspiration from the works of Liang Qichao (1873&ndash;1929),
a prominent modern Chinese thinker (Han 2016: 105&ndash;108), Han
Yongun equated free will with the Buddhist concept of suchness, the
true nature of all beings. In comparing Kant&rsquo;s philosophy with
Buddhism, Liang Qichao interpreted suchness as the moral subject
possessing free will, whereas the state of ignorance prior to
enlightenment reflects the absence of free will. Liang further argued
that while Kant&rsquo;s moral subject pertained to individuals,
Buddha&rsquo;s suchness applied universally to all human beings. Han
Yongun embraced this interpretation, using it as a basis to assert
Buddhism&rsquo;s superiority over Western philosophy. It is worth
noting that a similar idea regarding the power of the human mind had
been previously mentioned in Korean Buddhist philosophy.</p>

<p>
Moreover, Han Yongun characterized Buddhism as embodying egalitarian
principles. Within Buddhist philosophy, two worlds exist: the world of
conventional truth and the world of ultimate truth. The former, which
emerges from the principle of cause and effect, holds a variety of
distinct beings. Conversely, the world of ultimate truth represents
the inherent nature of all beings, manifesting itself as pure
emptiness. Building upon this philosophical foundation, he
articulated,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Looking from the viewpoint of inequality, there is nothing that is not
unequal, but from the viewpoint of equality, there is nothing that is
not equal. What, then, is inequality? It refers to the fact that all
things and phenomena are subject to the laws of necessity. What does
equality mean? It refers to the free, unconstrained truth that
transcends time and space. (Han 2016: 112&ndash;113)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this manner, Han Yongun modernized the interpretation of Buddhist
teachings. Furthermore, he postulated that the future would be a
Buddhist world because its foundational teachings guarantee freedom
for all beings in an egalitarian setting. Later, he integrated
socialist ideas into his concept of egalitarianism, envisioning a form
of Buddhist socialism.</p>

<h4 id="CompBuddChri">5.1.3 Comparison of Buddhism to Christianity</h4>

<p>
In response to the competition posed by Christian missionary works,
Paek Yongs&#335;ng (1864&ndash;1940) embarked on a comparative
analysis between Christianity and Buddhism with the aim of
demonstrating the superiority of Buddhism (Paek 2016). He argued that
Christianity lacked a comprehensive understanding of the mind, even
though it shared similarities with the concept of a fair exchange of
good deeds and their rewards. Expanding on this viewpoint, he
critiqued the notion of God as a separate creator distinct from his
creations. According to Buddhist philosophy, the original mind gives
rise to all beings, and that Buddha&rsquo;s mind resides within the
minds of individuals. He also criticized the idea of divine punishment
for original sin, as it seemed harsh for a creator to chastise
individuals after permitting them to err.</p>

<h4 id="IdenKoreBudd">5.1.4 The Identity of Korean Buddhism</h4>

<p>
Amid the effort to align Buddhism with Western thought, there emerged
a movement to preserve traditional Korean Buddhism and rediscover
Korea&rsquo;s distinct identity. Monk S&#335;kj&#335;n
(1870&ndash;1948) started teaching Buddhist classics to individuals
passionate about Korean studies and the essence of Korea&rsquo;s
spirit. Among his students, Ch&rsquo;oe Nams&#335;n (1890&ndash;1957)
wrote two articles delineating the identity of Korean Buddhism:
&ldquo;Overview of Korean Buddhism: A Diachronic Approach to Korean
Buddhism&rdquo; (1918) and &ldquo;Korean Buddhism: Its Position in the
Cultural History of the East&rdquo; (1930). Through these works, he
emphasizes that Korean monks played an active and significant role in
the evolution of Buddhism in East Asia, rather than merely
assimilating Chinese Buddhism. He asserts that Korean Buddhism
surpassed other East Asian forms of Buddhism, both in its
philosophical depth and artistic expression.</p>

<p>
Ch&rsquo;oe Nams&#335;n gives special attention to the Hwajaeng
philosophy of W&#335;nhyo, which encapsulates all Buddhist teachings
and practices as one. He dubbed this form of Buddhism as
&ldquo;unified Buddhism&rdquo;, &ldquo;completed Buddhism&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;synthesis Buddhism&rdquo;, asserting it as the distinctive
identity of Korean Buddhism. Ch&rsquo;oe&rsquo;s arguments continued
to be well-received by Korean Buddhist scholars even after
Korea&rsquo;s liberation, leading to &ldquo;Unified Buddhism&rdquo;
being perceived as a defining characteristic of Korean Buddhism. This
view persisted until 1985 when it was questioned by Shim Jaeryong
(Shim 1999: 171&ndash;181).</p>

<p>
In response to modernization, Korean Buddhism pursued preservation and
reform strategies. Monk S&#335;kj&#335;n and Ch&rsquo;oe Nams&#335;n
emphasized its distinctive identity, positioning &ldquo;Unified
Buddhism&rdquo; as a uniquely Korean concept. Meanwhile, Han Yongun
and Paek Yongs&#335;ng strove to modernize Buddhism, incorporating
Western thought and advocating its popularization. Korean Buddhist
intellectuals explored metaphysical aspects in Buddhism. These
collective efforts have embedded Korean Buddhism within the modern
era.</p>

<h3 id="PopuBudd">5.2 Popularizing Buddhism</h3>

<p>
The essence of modernity lies in its emancipation from mysticism,
embracing human reason and the growth of individual rights. These
notions also resonated with the transformation of Korean Buddhism
during this period. Most laypeople of that era predominantly engaged
in offering prayers to Buddhist deities for their well-being, a
practice considered incompatible with the ideals of modernity.
Consequently, Buddhist intellectuals began to emphasize individual
practices for enlightenment and the development of more accessible
daily-life practices, while also directing their attention to pressing
social issues.</p>

<h4 id="EnliSociEnga">5.2.1 Enlightenment and social engagement</h4>

<p>
Paek Yongs&#335;ng identified enlightenment as the unique and pivotal
aspect of Buddhist thought, aiming to reestablish its original intent
in the lives of laypeople. Rooted in S&#335;n Buddhism,
&ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; denoted the realization of one&rsquo;s
intrinsic Buddhahood. Great enlightenment, in this context, signifies
the attainment of the original nature of the human mind&mdash;Buddha
nature. According to Paek, all individuals should attain this
realization and assist others in doing the same. The attainment of
enlightenment serves as a means for individuals to discover their own
identities and inner strength. To popularize this notion, he
established the Order of Great Enlightenment (<em>Daekakgyo</em>) in
1922 and initiated the <em>Daegak</em> school movement, offering
meditation classes to laypeople, which was previously unavailable to
the public.</p>

<p>
However, their commitment extended beyond personal enlightenment, as
they emphasized social engagement rooted in the Buddhist teaching of
&ldquo;saving sentient beings.&rdquo; Paek Yongs&#335;ng and Han
Yongun were not just theorists but also activists who actively
participated in social movements, such as the independence movement.
While Han Yongun was intrigued by social Buddhism, he didn&rsquo;t
develop his own comprehensive theory. In contrast, Paek S&#335;nguk
expanded his philosophical journey to include social theory. After a
thorough examination of cosmology, he posited that a single principle
(<em>illi</em>) constructed the cosmos. Applying this principle to the
human world, he argued that it could transform this impure land into
Pure Land (Paek 2021: 81).</p>

<p>
According to Paek, this principle applied to three aspects of human
life: in legal life, it dictated the rules of human communities; in
economic life, it ensured fair distribution; and in spiritual life, it
bestowed meaningful existence. Paek contended that each facet of life
should maintain its boundaries and balance, with spiritual life taking
the lead. An excessive focus on legal life might suppress economic
equality and individual freedom, while an overemphasis on economic
life could turn humans into mere working machines. If spiritual life
remained intertwined with the other spheres, it might disrupt the
intended direction, ultimately benefiting humanity and guiding a more
humane existence. In his social theory, Paek S&#335;nguk effectively
fused Hwa&#335;m Buddhist philosophy with modern social theory.</p>

<h4 id="WonBudd">5.2.2 Won Buddhism</h4>

<p>
Won Buddhism, a relatively modern Buddhist movement, was founded by
Park Jungbin (1891&ndash;1943), who later came to be known as
Sot&rsquo;aesan. Interestingly, Park did not undergo formal training
in the Buddhist tradition; instead, his connection to Buddhism emerged
after enlightenment, which he recognized as akin to the descriptions
of enlightenment found in Buddhism. Won Buddhism predominantly
embraces Buddhist teachings but reformulates them in a manner that is
more accessible to laypeople. Central to its philosophy is the belief
that Buddhism should transcend distinctions between Buddhist clergy
and lay practitioners, as well as between Buddha and sentient beings.
The doctrinal foundation of Won Buddhism is articulated in the
Scripture of Won Buddhism (<em>W&#335;nbulgyo kyoj&#335;n</em>).</p>

<p>
At the core of Won Buddhism&rsquo;s doctrinal framework lies the
concept of the &ldquo;One Circle Form&rdquo;
(<em>irw&#335;nsang</em>), symbolizing the dharmakaya Buddha, which
represents the essence of all beings and Buddhas, as well as Buddha
nature. This concept is depicted in a circular form because it
signifies the perpetual transformation between being and non-being,
revealing their inherent emptiness and completeness. The ultimate
objective of Won Buddhism is to attain Buddhahood, aligning with the
aspirations of other Buddhist traditions. To achieve this
enlightenment, Sot&rsquo;aesan introduced the framework of four
beneficent sources of human life and three practices. The four
beneficent sources are heaven and earth, parents, brethren, and law,
as they grant life and support one&rsquo;s existence. The three core
practices in Won Buddhism mirror the traditional Buddhist triad of
sam&#257;dhi, wisdom, and precepts. These practices are structured as
follows: cultivation of the spirit (<em>ch&#335;ngsin suyang</em>),
inquiry into facts and principles (<em>sari y&#335;n&rsquo;gu</em>),
and careful selection of karmic actions (<em>chag&#335;p
ch&rsquo;wisa</em>).</p>

<p>
These practices are adapted from the foundational principles of
Buddhism and serve as a guide for spiritual development. In daily
life, practitioners are encouraged to engage in regular meditation
referred to as &ldquo;timeless Zen&rdquo; (<em>Musis&#335;ppob</em>)
and adhere to the nine essential dharmas of daily practice, aimed at
dispelling afflictions. Among these nine rules, three correspond to
the fundamental practices mentioned earlier, emphasizing the
transformation of negative mindsets into positive virtues, including
belief, zeal, dedication, gratitude, self-reliance, and goodwill.</p>

<h4 id="BuddEnga">5.2.3 Buddhism of Engagement</h4>

<p>
In the 1980s, Minjung Buddhism emerged as part of the Minjung movement
in South Korea, a social movement dedicated to the liberation of the
&ldquo;<em>minjung</em>&rdquo;. The term
&ldquo;<em>minjung</em>&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;common
people&rdquo;, refers to those who are oppressed by the ruling class
but who nonetheless have the potential to become agents in shaping
history. Alongside Minjung movement activists, young Buddhists
established the Minjung Buddhism Society in 1975. Ch&#335;n
Jaes&#335;ng wrote &ldquo;The Theory of Minjung Buddhism&rdquo; and
published it in the journal <em>Dialogue</em> (<em>Daehwa</em>) in
1977. Although the article did not present intense, argumentative
discourse, it did introduce the basic principles of Minjung Buddhism
and encouraged young Buddhists to participate in the Minjung Buddhist
movement.</p>

<p>
Minjung Buddhists derived their theoretical framework from Buddhist
philosophy, adapted via Marxist theory. They sought a Buddhist
teaching that resonated with Marxist ideology and found numerous
similarities between Marxism and early Buddhism. Both systems embrace
atheism, materialism, empiricism, and egalitarianism. Early Buddhism
explained the world without reference to gods, depicted matter as the
basis of human existence, emphasized empiricism, and advocated for
egalitarian communities of monks akin to the primitive communities
described by Marx. A Buddhist monk, P&#335;ps&#335;ng, brought
together the varied threads of Minjung Buddhist philosophical
discourse and highlighted how Minjung Buddhism reinterpreted
fundamental Buddhist concepts to reveal the revolutionary
characteristics of Buddhism. The concepts included dependent arising,
karma, and Pure Land, with all new interpretations pointing towards
emphasizing the self-reliance of the minjung.</p>

<p>
The principle of dependent arising supports the social engagement of
Buddhism. It situates each individual&rsquo;s life in the broader
scope of history and reveals history to be a tapestry woven from the
threads of individual lives. Additionally, one&rsquo;s deeds and
social activities lead to social change because people and society are
interconnected. This new interpretation formed the basis for the
argument that the minjung has the capacity to promote change.</p>

<p>
Minjung Buddhists also understood karma as people&rsquo;s creative
activity that shapes the world and transforms themselves. Utilizing
the concept of &ldquo;karma,&rdquo; they emphasized human
self-reliance, asserting that without human action or karma, no change
or revolution can occur. They drew parallels between the Marxist
concept of &ldquo;motion&rdquo;, a fundamental principle in
dialectical materialism that denotes the continuous change in the
world and human thought, and karma. They proposed that the motion of
the world is a universal principle and karma embodies this principle
in humans. That is, karma is the expression of human engagement with
the world, and it constitutes a part of the world&rsquo;s overall
motion. One&rsquo;s past karma influences the present, and present
karma molds the future, implying that the entire world is shaped by
the power of karma. The emphasis on human self-reliance in the concept
of karma is strongly tied to the idea of the minjung, which signifies
not just oppressed but also agents of historical and social change.
Both Minjung Buddhism and Minjung theology highlight the potential of
the minjung to bring about revolution.</p>

<p>
Minjung Buddhists aimed to establish an ideal society called Pure Land
(<em>J&#335;ngto</em>). Traditionally, Pure Land Buddhist philosophy
encompasses two aspects: being reborn in Amita Buddha&rsquo;s Pure
Land, and creating the Pure Land in this world at this moment. Minjung
Buddhists accepted the latter, arguing that we can live in the Pure
Land when we strive to overcome the contradictions of society and
individuals. Through Minjung Buddhism, Korean Buddhists envisioned a
social revolution.</p>

<p>
After the democratization of South Korea in 1987, the Minjung Buddhist
movement gradually waned. Most of its members transformed the movement
into a more socially accessible form known as &ldquo;practical
Buddhism&rdquo; (<em>Silch&rsquo;&#335;n Bulgyo</em>), which later
evolved into &ldquo;socially engaged Buddhism&rdquo;
(<em>Ch&rsquo;amy&#335; Bulgyo</em>). They have led environmental
protection, Korean unification, and other social movements. The
philosophy of Minjung Buddhism became the theoretical foundation for
socially underpinning for socially engaged Buddhism, which is rooted
in the belief that individuals are the agents of societal change and
that people&rsquo;s creative actions can transform the world.</p>

<p>
Two notable groups actively involved in social issues blend these
principles with traditional Buddhist philosophy: The Jungto Society
and Indra&rsquo;s Net Community. The Jungto Society adopted the
Minjung Buddhists&rsquo; objective of creating the Pure Land in our
current world. However, the Jungto Society does not focus on political
revolution; instead, its primary concerns are individual happiness and
a harmonious world based on non-dualistic Buddhist philosophy.
Meanwhile, the Indra&rsquo;s Net Community embraces the Hwa&#335;m
philosophy of an interconnected world, encapsulated in the idea that
&ldquo;one is all, and all is one&rdquo;. The metaphor of
Indra&rsquo;s net implies the teaching that all beings are
interconnected. As such, the Indra&rsquo;s net Community concentrates
on restoring the connection between people and the earth through
ecological movements and care for all life forms on earth.</p>

<h3 id="WomeKoreBuddPhil">5.3 Women and Korean Buddhist Philosophy</h3>

<p>
In the modern era, women struggled for gender equality and sought
liberation within a patriarchal society. Kim Iry&#335;p
(1896&ndash;1971), a leading figure among the &ldquo;New Woman&rdquo;
(<em>Siny&#335;s&#335;ng</em>) of her time, actively confronted these
issues and discovered profound insights within S&#335;n Buddhism.
Prior to her life as a Buddhist nun, she gained recognition as a
prominent writer among female intellectuals and was deeply involved in
the women&rsquo;s movement. Following her ordination as a nun, she
wholeheartedly dedicated herself to Buddhist practice and philosophy,
although not explicitly engaging in the women&rsquo;s movement.
Nevertheless, her explorations delved into women&rsquo;s issues at a
more fundamental level (J. Park 2017b). Nearly three decades later,
she published a book, <em>Reflections of a Zen Buddhist Nun</em> and
rekindled her connection with society. In her essays, she skillfully
applied traditional S&#335;n teachings to address gender-related
problems and presented a novel approach to philosophical inquiry.</p>

<p>
Within her essay collection, Kim Iry&#335;p employed her personal
experiences as a foundation for philosophical contemplation, all
within the context of Buddhist teachings. Through her life journey as
a woman, she sought answers to profound questions regarding human
existence, identity, societal constraints, and love, all framed within
the context of Buddhist principles. Her essay titled &ldquo;Having
Burnt Away My Youth&rdquo; (Kim 2014, 140&ndash;198) provides a detailed
account of her philosophical odyssey.</p>

<p>
During her S&#335;n practice, she encountered the concept of the
&ldquo;great self,&rdquo; representing a universal existence that
transcended individual selves. Kim Iry&#335;p made a clear distinction
between the individual self, often referred to as the &ldquo;small
self,&rdquo; and the authentic universal great self. This great self
was not an independent entity but rather symbolized the totality of
all beings. In the context of gender-related issues, the &ldquo;small
self&rdquo; represented the confined &ldquo;I,&rdquo; constrained by
societal gender norms, while the &ldquo;great self&rdquo; epitomized
the liberated self, free from societal restrictions. Prior to her
engagement with Buddhist philosophy, she had primarily focused on
seeking liberation amid the conflict between her individual self and
societal norms. However, as a Buddhist nun, she achieved freedom by
transcending this dualistic thinking, thereby attaining existential
liberation.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, she introduced the concept of &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; as
the pathway to liberation from the constricting small self and the
embrace of the expansive great self. This creativity was synonymous
with each person&rsquo;s original mind, which served as the wellspring
of one&rsquo;s existence. Recognizing this original mind led to the
realization of becoming a &ldquo;complete being,&rdquo; someone whose
existence harmonized with the universe. Kim Iry&#335;p&rsquo;s
philosophy vividly illustrated how Buddhist teachings could serve as a
powerful tool for both personal and social transformation.</p>

<p>
Another noteworthy Buddhist nun, Daehaeng (1927&ndash;2012), the
founder of the Hanma&#365;m S&#335;n Center (<em>Hanma&#365;m
S&#335;nw&#335;n</em>), revolutionized traditional Buddhist practices
in response to the needs of people. Her focus was on healing
individuals, and she proposed <em>Hanma&#365;m</em> thought and
<em>Juingong</em> practice as methods for healing.
&ldquo;<em>Hanma&#365;m</em>&rdquo; signifies the concept of
&ldquo;one Mind&rdquo; (<em>ilsim</em>), an alternative expression of
Buddha nature and essence. <em>Hanma&#365;m</em> existed equally
within all beings, and all beings derived from it.
&ldquo;<em>Juingong</em>&rdquo; referred to the insubstantial doer,
the individual manifestation of <em>Hanma&#365;m</em>. Daehaeng
advocated a practice of surrendering everything to <em>Juingong</em>,
as it represented the center and true master of oneself.
<em>Juingong</em> practice did not necessitate specific times or
places for sitting meditation; instead, one could simply call upon
<em>Juingong</em> whenever the need arose. This practice was highly
accessible to ordinary people in their daily lives.</p>

<p>
These women Buddhist philosophers reshaped traditional Buddhist
philosophy and demonstrated the capacity of Buddhist teachings to
address profound existential questions. Their dedicated efforts also
contributed to the enrichment of the tapestry of Korean Buddhist
philosophy.</p>
