<h1>Mental Disorder (Illness)</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Feb 20, 2019; substantive revision Wed Sep 4, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Mental disorder (earlier entitled &ldquo;illness&rdquo; or
&ldquo;disease&rdquo;) is ascribed to deviations from normal thoughts,
reasoning, feelings, attitudes, and actions that are considered
socially or personally dysfunctional and apt for treatment.
Schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder are core examples. The
concept of mental disorder plays a role in many domains, including
medicine, social sciences such as psychology and anthropology, and the
humanities, including literature and philosophy. Philosophical
discussions are the primary focus of the present entry, which differs
from the entry on
 <a href="../psychiatry/">Philosophy of Psychiatry</a>
 in noting several different approaches&mdash;not only those of the
philosophy of science and mind, but also those arising from
phenomenology and social theory.</p>

<p>
Mental disorder is a widely contested concept and there are
longstanding debates on whether disorders are biological or social in
nature. Even uncontroversial disorders, such as those listed above,
were not always regarded as disorders in the past (Porter 2002).
Moreover, the status of mental disorder has frequently indicated
ethical, as much as other deficiency (Irwin 2013). Such reminders
direct our attention to contemporary medical psychiatry&rsquo;s
sometimes uncompromisingly neurobiological, and avowedly value-free
&ldquo;medical model&rdquo;, with its incumbent analogies and
assumptions, and to the general question of how the taxa of
psychiatric classifications are to be viewed as objects of natural
science. This model has received intensive philosophical scrutiny,
including arguments that deny these conditions are deficiencies at
all. Along with issues arising from cognitive psychology and the
neurosciences, such foundational matters make up much of the following
entry. Because of their focus on issues central to the philosophy of
mind and ethics (e.g., the mind-body problem, moral responsibility,
agency and identity), analyses of mental disorder have extensive
implications for those fields. As clinical phenomena, they also
reflect an inescapable, everyday, social reality, giving theoretical
inquiries additionally urgent practical, moral, and legal
implications.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Term">1. Terminology</h2>

<p>
The language here is highly contentious. There are exceptions, but in
a long history mental disorders or illnesses have been characterized
as &ldquo;evil&rdquo;, &ldquo;sinful&rdquo;, and &ldquo;willful
error&rdquo; or, at the very least, regarded as unwelcome
 misfortune.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 With some regularity, conditions listed in the &ldquo;<em>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>&rdquo; (DSM) of the
American Psychiatric Association (APA 2013) and the
&ldquo;<em>International Classification of Disease</em>&rdquo; (ICD)
of the World Health Organization (WHO 2020) have provided new
classificatory titles and terminology, such revisions often solely
aimed at reducing negative and stigmatizing associations. Authors
cited in what follows use &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;,
&ldquo;psychiatric disability&rdquo;, &ldquo;psychiatric
disorder&rdquo;, &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo;, &ldquo;madness&rdquo;,
&ldquo;psychopathology&rdquo;, and &ldquo;neuro-atypicality&rdquo;.
Controversy attaches to these terms, as it does to particular
diagnostic labels (such as &ldquo;schizophrenia&rdquo;). Because some
would question whether these mental differences are forms of illness
or disorder at all, the more neutral but rarely used, &ldquo;mental
difference&rdquo; perhaps better accommodates each side of this
controversy, so the choice of &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; here is for its
greater familiarity, and not intended to promote a disorder or illness
view.</p>

<p>
Three changes of language require special attention. With increasing
frequency, the term &ldquo;<em>illness</em>&rdquo; in &ldquo;mental
illness&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;<em>disorder</em>&rdquo;,
apparently without a consistent rationale beyond avoiding explicitly
medical associations. In a parallel recent trend &ldquo;the
cognitive&rdquo; and &ldquo;cognition&rdquo; are sometimes introduced
as equivalents or replacements for &ldquo;the mental&rdquo;. This new
language around &ldquo;cognition&rdquo; collapses the earlier faculty
psychology divisions of affection and cognition: as much as doxastic
states, emotions are
 &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Finally, increasing use of &ldquo;mental <em>and
behavioral</em>&rdquo;, sometimes shortened to
&ldquo;behavioral&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;behavioral health&rdquo;),
reflects substantive changes, such as the inclusion of addictions in
the class of disorders and a preference for precisely measurable
symptoms over subjective report.</p>

<p>
Unless otherwise indicated, the expression &ldquo;mental
disorder&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; in what follows,
and refers not only to more &ldquo;mental&rdquo; conditions like
psychoses and affective disorders, but also to
&ldquo;behavioral&rdquo; conditions such as addictions and personality
disorders. Frequently, the shift from &ldquo;mental&rdquo; to
&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; also indicates allegiance to substantive
theoretical tenets. Here, however, &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; and
&ldquo;cognition&rdquo; are used only as terms of art within
particular theoretical analyses.</p>

<h2 id="FolkPsycConcAnalScie">2. Folk Psychology, Conceptual Analysis, and Science</h2>

<p>
Concepts of mental disorder are understood differently in the
perspectives of folk psychology (which privilege common-sense
understandings) and medical psychiatry (which privilege scientific
understandings). Inconsistencies arising at the boundaries, where
mental disorders meet other kinds of disorder, add ambiguity. Rather
than traditionally mental symptoms, for example,
&ldquo;hysterical&rdquo; (&ldquo;psychosomatic&rdquo;,
&ldquo;somatoform&rdquo;, &ldquo;functional&rdquo; or
&ldquo;conversion&rdquo;) syndromes exhibit bodily maladies and
dysfunction (Scull 2009). Yet they remain mental disorders in common
understanding, and have long found a place in standard psychiatric
 classifications.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
There are different views about the conceptual relationship between
everyday and more clinical language about mental disorder, and
philosophers and others have approached this matter according to
varying foundational assumptions. Both commonsense psychology and
conceptual analysis reflecting it, are part of what Rachel Cooper
calls a broadly &ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; project, which engages
linguistic intuitions (Cooper 2020). Opinions vary as to the value and
importance of the resulting characterizations. Some insist that the
concept of mental disorder employed in psychiatry&rsquo;s conception
and classification of disorders is too closely allied to the parallel
concepts in folk psychology. Dominic Murphy (2006) argues that folk
psychology is inadequate to the scientific taxonomical task of
discovering the &ldquo;hidden causal structure&rdquo; of mental
disorders, since there is no assurance that common sense
understandings correspond to scientifically tractable concepts.
Without a principled and systematic way to identify the class of
mental disorders, these concerns suggest that any taxonomy that is
employed will likely prove inaccurate and the outmoded, folk
psychological category of mental disorder will eventually be rendered
obsolete.</p>

<p>
More conservatively, others have urged the practical importance of
maintaining the category of mental disorder (Br&uuml;lde &amp; Radovic
2006). Everyday language and the traditional classifications built
around it have provided a common framework for research and clinical
practice; and with any further blurring of the boundaries between
mental disorders and the brain damage and disease treated by
neurologists, demarcations of professional competence would be lost.
Conversely, the scientific authority of medical psychiatry has been
challenged by those who express fears of overdiagnosis, granting too
much power to psychiatry and the pharmacology industry, and
inappropriate deference to &lsquo;expert opinions&rsquo; on mental
health and eudaimonia that may be better addressed by non-scientific
perspectives (see
 <a href="#AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">&sect;10</a>).</p>
 
<p>
It is not only for such considerations of practicality and custom that
common sense concepts have been supported. Some analyses adhere to an
account of mind and mental processing employing mentalist terms and
normative presuppositions inapplicable within an exclusively
neuro-physical framework (see
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">&sect;4</a>,
 <a href="#PhenAppr">&sect;5</a>, and
 <a href="#ValuMentDiso">&sect;8</a>).
 Others regard mental disorders as socially constructed entities, the
existence and classification of which are inextricably tied to
societal and interpersonal features of the world (see
 <a href="#AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">&sect;10</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A taxonomy of these varying foundational assumptions includes
intersecting issues: what mental disorders are, how much we presently
know about them, and different approaches to their analysis. In one
set of contrasts, naturalist (or objectivist) accounts hold
that&mdash;as empirically discoverable entities&mdash;mental disorders
can be provided value-free description, while normative (or
evaluativist) analyses deny the possibility of such description
(discussed in
 <a href="#EvalNormObjeNatu">&sect;8.1</a>).
 Revisionists, prepared to relinquish all current concepts, disagree
with conservatives favoring the retention of (at least some)
traditional categories. And, in a final sorting, the nature of mental
disorder will be sought either through <em>a posteriori</em>
scientific research based in neurocognitive science, or through
conceptual analysis derived in part or whole from social and cultural
norms.</p>

<h2 id="MentMentDiso">3. The <em>Mental</em> in Mental Disorder</h2>

<p>
In a once-common practice, mental or &ldquo;functional&rdquo;
disorders were diagnosed just when no somatic traits were evident.
Such language is now explicitly disavowed, eclipsed by a growing
recognition that all disorders involve bodily states (APA 2013: 309;
O&rsquo;Leary 2021). Still, the &ldquo;mental&rdquo; in mental
disorder is variously construed.</p>

<h3 id="InteCausDownSympMani">3.1 Internal Causes and External Symptoms</h3>

<p>
On traditional, two-part models from cell pathology, dysfunctional
organic processes internal to the individual are manifested in, and
causally responsible for, more readily observable external symptoms.
Applied to mental disorder, certain underlying processes have been
delimited as mental by appeal to the traditional categories of faculty
psychology (perception, affection, cognition, memory, and so on). For
example, hallucinations represent dysfunctional perceptual
capabilities, mania and depression disturbed affect regulation, and
delusions defective cognitive processing. A disorder is thus
determined to be <em>mental</em> (as distinct from physical) if its
internal causes involve psychological faculties (Wakefield 1997).
Other accounts ascribe disordered mentality&mdash;not to underlying
features but&mdash;to effects on the subject&rsquo;s social and
personal functioning (Rashed &amp; Bingham 2014). For example, it is
because her states of sadness and self-doubt result in absenteeism,
that the person with depression seeks medical help (see
 <a href="#SuffDisa">&sect;4.2</a>).
 More holistic and &ldquo;biopsychosocial&rdquo; accounts combine
these features (Nordenfelt 1995; Davies &amp; Roache 2017; Bolton
&amp; Gillett 2019; O&rsquo;Leary 2021).</p>

<p>
On two-stage accounts both internal and external features form
integral parts (Graham [2013] argues that this holds for prototypical
disorders). Internal and external features are each included in the
DSM definition of mental disorder:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an
individual&rsquo;s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior, that
reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological <em>or</em>
developmental processes underlying mental functioning. (APA 2013: 20,
emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The different positions on mental disorder just
sketched&mdash;emphasizing internal conditions, observable
manifestations (&ldquo;symptoms&rdquo;), and both&mdash;are discussed
in
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">Section 4</a>.
 Each position exhibits vulnerabilities. Accounts stressing inherent
features regularly rely on hypothetical entities or processes,
expecting that future discoveries will reveal knowledge of causal
mechanisms presently hidden from view (This position has a long
history; see Murphy 2006, Tabb 2015). Often accounted for by its
status as a new science, this faith has been sorely tested, thus far,
by confused classifications, apparently ill-grounded research, and
other liabilities, as well as incomplete models of mental dysfunction
(see
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">&sect;4</a>
 and
 <a href="#Clas">&sect;6</a>).
 If these impediments can be overcome, emphasis on internal causes may
be expected to yield powerful explanatory models, laying the ground
for targeted interventions and effective prevention and treatment (see
the entry on
 <a href="../psychiatry/">Philosophy of Psychiatry</a>).
 Placing emphasis on disabling or dysfunctional observable symptoms
has comparable vulnerabilities. One setting&rsquo;s dysfunctional
mental symptom may be another&rsquo;s normal, admired, or useful
trait; and mental disorder must be distinguished conceptually from
deviance, as well as from normal responses to the normal losses and
setbacks that are common in human experience (see
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">&sect;4</a>,
 <a href="#ValuMentDiso">&sect;8</a>, and
 <a href="#AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">&sect;10</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="MarkMent">3.2 The Mark of the Mental</h3>

<p>
In some philosophical accounts (including those stemming from
phenomenological traditions), the mental is distinguished by
particular features: it bears a special relationship to conscious
awareness and to persons, for example, or may be taken to exhibit the
distinctive &ldquo;aboutness&rdquo; or intentionality exclusive to
mental attitudes (see
 <a href="#PhenAppr">&sect;5</a>).
 Similarly, some theorizing emphasizes the reasons-responsiveness of
all human thought and action, by which disorder can alone be explained
and understood (Campbell 2013; Thornton 2007; Summers &amp;
Sinnott-Armstrong 2019).</p>

<p>
Explanations in cognitive psychology have taken several different
forms over the years: information processing models, connectionist
networks, and neuroscientific approaches. Moreover, philosophical
reconstructions of cognitive psychology and cognitive science must be
distinguished from the cognitive psychology practiced by
psychologists&mdash;although little discussion of &ldquo;the
mental&rdquo; occurs in either. Instead, focus is on the cognitive
when, as was pointed out earlier, the &ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; subsumes
capacities, states, and processes that used to be considered
non-cognitive, such as sensations and emotions. Widespread acceptance
of these shifts in much theoretical and research writing on mental
disorder has gone some way toward eclipsing philosophical concepts of
mind and the mental, although commonsense cognitive capacities (which
are assumed in philosophical accounts of intentionality) remain the
starting point of the research program of cognitive science, and
cognitive studies of traditional &ldquo;mental states&rdquo;, such as
reasoning and consciousness.</p>

<p>
The focus of cognitive psychology usually lies with computation and
representation. Mental/cognitive states (representations) depict
features of the outside world (as well as other mental states and
abstract entities) and mental/cognitive processes operate on those
inner symbols, transforming and manipulating them (see Von Eckardt
1993; Friedenberg &amp; Silverman 2011; Cratsley &amp; Samuels 2013,
and the entry on
 <a href="../cognitive-science/">Cognitive Science</a>).
 Although demarcated by the faculties known as &ldquo;mental&rdquo;,
the realm of the cognitive is typically construed as properties or
processes with a causal role in determining behavior, or behavioral
capacities, that offer no resistance to naturalistic characterization
(Chalmers 1996). Candidates for a distinctive &ldquo;mark of the
cognitive&rdquo; are debated&mdash;but so is the need for one (Varga
2018; Allen 2017).</p>

<h3 id="MetaImpl">3.3 Metaphysical Implications</h3>

<p>
Mental disorders are conditions or states attributed to persons, but
this need entail neither that they are entirely non-physical in
nature, nor that they must (or even can), be explained in solely
neuro-scientific terms. Maintaining the separation between mental and
physical disorders is compatible with some forms of weak physicalism,
allowing that mental or psychological processing involved in functions
such as perception, reasoning and memory, are realized in the workings
of the brain (see Schaffner 2016; Jefferson 2021 and the entry on
 <a href="../health-disease/">Health</a>).
 Problems of supervenience and emergence have led some to defend a
holistic &ldquo;naturalistic dualism&rdquo; entailed in a
biopsychosocial model (Bolton &amp; Gillett 2019; O&rsquo;Leary
2021).</p>

<h2 id="DisoMentDiso">4. The <em>Disorder</em> in Mental Disorder</h2>

<p>
Schizophrenia, depression, and obsessions, bipolar disorder are core
instances of mental disorder, but psychiatric classification
recognizes many other conditions as well. From such a large and
heterogeneous collection, this broad category may be regarded as a
family resemblance one (Lilienfeld &amp; Marino 1995). Indeed, through
a different historical or cultural lens, the assembled variations
known today as mental disorders would likely appear incoherent and
arbitrary. Yet, spurred by essentialist expectations (and out of
concern about the unwarranted &ldquo;medicalization&rdquo; of normal
states and behavior), the quest for a unifying conception of mental
disorder (illness, or disease) has persisted within philosophical
research. Characteristic features have been identified, including
disunity, irrationality, the presence of suffering and disability,
several forms of dysfunction, and even adaptive function. Proposed
formal analytic definitions are illustrated in
 <a href="#FormDefi">Section 4.4</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="DisuIrra">4.1 Disunity and Irrationality</h3>

<p>
Works of ancient philosophy are focused more on the psyche&rsquo;s
health (or <em>eudaimonia</em>) than its illness. Nonetheless, there
are hints that just as a unified soul is one that is healthy (as well
as rational and virtuous), a soul lacking unity will be disturbed or
mad. Offering an account of the harmonious soul, whose rational and
non-rational elements achieve unity, Aristotle leaves us a picture of
the warring and fractured state of an unhealthy soul, for
 example.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 The emphasis on disunity is here tied to vice and irrationality: a
fully unified soul is virtuous and rational, a disunified one vicious
and irrational in its unhealthy divisions. This view of vices and
virtues is also characteristic of the subsequent Stoic analyses (Irwin
2013), although Aristotle adhered to a different account of the
passions and a more Platonic analysis of vice. A conception of mental
illness as psychic disunity (as well as an association between health,
rationality and virtue) reoccurs in later philosophy (in Spinoza, for
example), and in psychoanalytic traditions. Within present-day
disorder descriptions, some symptom clusters readily fit the classical
emphasis on disunity (addictions, and bipolarity, for example);
others, including most personality disorders, are less easily depicted
in such terms (Worrell &amp; Denham 2016).</p>

<p>
Mental disorder has been understood as irrationality (or
&ldquo;Unreason&rdquo;) after the &ldquo;Age of Reason&rdquo; that
prized order and logic (Foucault 1965). Together with the emergence of
empirical science, this emphasis is seen to have laid the foundation
for our contemporary psychiatric categories and
 theories.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 In the present day, cultural norms and intuitive folk psychology
assign the boundaries of mental disorder, and these intuitions
conflict about some particular conditions (e.g., addictions,
personality disorders). Yet disturbed or disabled doxastic states and
capabilities remain core examples of disorder, over which intuitive
agreement is strong. Characterized by incomprehensibly disordered
thought, failure to adjust beliefs in response to new evidence,
inconsistencies between thought and action, and delusional
convictions, psychosis and psychotic thought patterns are regularly
judged prototypical features of mental disorder. So the rationalistic
analysis of disorder corresponds&mdash;but only to a reduced version
of the presently sprawling overall category.</p>

<p>
Forms of doxastic irrationality are still the mainstay of much policy
and legal analysis about mental disorder. Assessments of criminal
responsibility, of fitness to stand trial, and of the capacity to
undertake binding contracts, for example, are expressed in terms of
the defendant&rsquo;s ability to know and understand (Reznek 1987;
Robinson 1996, 2013; Adshead 2008). Ostensibly, construing mental
disorder as a want of rationality has been weakened by evidence from
behavioral economics showing that holding and acting on well-grounded
and reasons-responsive beliefs occurs rarely in the general
population, and common prejudices and superstitions seem barely
distinguishable from clinical delusions with respect not only to their
prevalence but to the way they are adopted and maintained (Bortolotti
2009, 2013, 2020).</p>

<p>
Confidence that irrationality defines mental disorder is similarly
eroded if, understood as effective social function and personal
flourishing, mental health lies in traits such as unwarranted
optimism, and the distorting tendency to remember successes over
failures in &ldquo;positive illusions&rdquo;(Taylor &amp; Brown 1988;
McKay &amp; Dennett 2009; Jefferson et al. 2017). Along these lines,
some illusions, delusions, and hallucinations have recently been
acknowledged to be &ldquo;perfectly acceptable, sometimes praiseworthy
ways of being hopeful, committed to imagining and enacting a better
world for oneself and others&hellip;making moral and meaningful
lives&rdquo; (Flanagan &amp; Graham 2017: 309). Whether disorder is
usefully characterized as a want of reason also depends on guiding,
normative conceptions of mental health or <em>eudaimonia</em>, and on
the role of reason in those conceptions&mdash;not merely on facts of
the matter, or on consequentialist reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="SuffDisa">4.2 Suffering and Disability</h3>

<p>
Other depictions of disorder rely on one or both of the groups of
traits around <em>harm, suffering</em>, and <em>distress</em>, on the
one hand, and <em>disability, incapacity</em> and personal or
behavioral <em>dysfunction</em>, on the other. These are the features
noted in a series of influential prefatory remarks in the diagnostic
and statistical manuals (the DSMs and ICDs). The wording of the fifth
edition of the DSM introduces a disjunction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress
<em>or</em> disability in social, occupational, or other important
activities. (APA 2013 emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A very similar passage from the ICD-11 is comparably qualified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Disorder&rdquo;&hellip;is&hellip;a clinically recognizable set
of symptoms or behavior associated <em>in most cases</em> with
distress <em>and</em> with interference with personal functions. (WHO
2020, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Psychodynamic or psychoanalytic presuppositions may posit underlying
distresses that are masked or submerged within the psyche; and the
elusive phenomenology of some conditions suggests the presence of
nameless existential anxieties hidden from awareness (Ratcliffe 2008,
2017). But such explanations aside, distress has been widely regarded
as a ubiquitous feature of disorder. In symptom-focused accounts
laying stress on the <em>consequences</em> of the syndrome, distress
becomes prominent as a form of disabling dysfunction (Stein et al.
2010). Instead of separate criteria (and either singly or jointly
sufficient for disorder, as in the respective DSM and ICD definitions
above), suffering and dysfunction are conjoined on a
&ldquo;distress-impairment&rdquo; analysis, where disorder status is
assigned with (and defined by) distress that is &ldquo;unmanageable or
disabling&rdquo; (Bolton 2013). The plausibility of this analysis
increases with what have been called &ldquo;distress related
conditions&rdquo;, such as depression and anxiety, that are
&ldquo;more constitutive of the illness&rdquo; (Bolton 2012: 10; also
see
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">&sect;4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
To accommodate exceptions that seem neither distressing nor disabling
(such as manic states), mental disorder is sometimes characterized not
by distress and dysfunction but by raised risk of such outcomes (Gert
&amp; Culver 2004). But risk of disorder is not disorder, and risk
language invites troubling ethical issues around over-diagnosis and
false positives (Schwartz 2008; Stein et al. 2010; Bolton 2013;
Broome, Fugar-Poli, &amp; Wuyts 2013; Radden 2018).</p>

<p>
Loosely understood, moreover, distresses are an inescapable part of
the human condition and normal responses to life&rsquo;s vicissitudes.
When and whether normal (and even appropriate) suffering reflects
pathology has long been the source of philosophical&mdash;and
societal&mdash;disagreement (Wilkinson 2000; Horwitz &amp; Wakefield
2007). In the discussions of &ldquo;normal sadness&rdquo; that
accompanied the revision of the fifth edition of the DSM, the grief
exclusion that had (temporarily) exempted from diagnosis the suffering
around mourning and grief, was challenged, its proposed elimination
charged with &ldquo;medicalizing&rdquo; or &ldquo;pathologizing&rdquo;
normal and appropriate human feelings (Zachar 2014; Wakefield 2012).
The separation of normal from pathological distress will be indicated
by distress emanating from the disorder itself, rather than from other
contingencies. But presently, distresses resulting from the stigma and
discrimination that follow diagnosis and treatment, as well as a host
of other, frequently negative, consequences in jarring and alarming
disruptions to personal lives, selves, and relationships, prove
difficult to disentangle (Tekin 2011).</p>

<p>
Some predict that biological markers will eventually allow us to
distinguish distress that is a symptom of depression, for example,
from that which is a normal response to external contingencies
(Horwitz &amp; Wakefield 2007). Such biomarkers may be welcomed by
those decrying over-diagnosis (Stegenga 2008, ch. 6), although an
evaluative interpretation as to whether, and when, such biomarkers
occur in healthy and unhealthy form will be required.</p>

<p>
Some argue that the subjective experience of distress and the extent
of impairment of the person&rsquo;s day-to-day functioning are
intrinsic properties of disorders like depression: conceptually,
disorder attributions are made on the basis of &ldquo;consequences of
the syndrome as they manifest for the subject&rdquo; (Rashed &amp;
Bingham 2014: 245). Psychological symptoms may <em>constitute</em> a
mental disorder, even as it is caused by biological or social factors.
In the absence of known biomarkers, depression is attributed based on
psychological symptoms alone; and were known biomarkers present
without evidence of any psychological symptoms, our intuitions
suggest, disorder attribution would be withheld. These intuitions may
shift with time, it is recognized, depending on how most people and
most psychiatrists <em>now</em> understand, define, diagnose, and
treat, depression. In current practices, attributions of depression
are made without biomarkers (Cooper 2020).</p>

<p>
Analyses characterizing felt distress as a property constitutive of
some given psychiatric condition (e.g., depression) are also
compatible with recent models focused on the causally interconnected
statistical networks making up symptom clusters. These clusters are
depicted as reinforced through feedback loops that serve to link
together assorted symptoms independent of any underlying, antecedent,
common, cause. In the case of depression, a range of symptoms arise
from diverse sources and, through their looping interactions, form,
worsen, and maintain the disorder as a relatively stable entity and
conceptual whole (Kendler, Zachar, &amp; Craver 2011; Borsboom &amp;
Cramer 2013; Borsboom 2017).</p>

<p>
Symptom-focused accounts may combine suffering with disability. But a
conception in terms of what the affected person is prevented from
doing, or unable to do as well as others, captured in the ideas of
disability, impairment, incapacity and personal or behavioral
dysfunction, offers an alternative characterization that can
acknowledge disorders without apparent personal suffering (notably,
mania and narcissistic personality disorder).</p>

<p>
Dysfunction and disability have been allied or treated as rough
equivalents; but sometimes disability is placed in opposition to
dysfunction. Instead of being construed as internal to the person,
disabilities are often represented as <em>conditional</em>
impairments, dependent on context (including physical and social
arrangements). They impose limitations on the person&rsquo;s ability
to perform everyday activities and participate as more typically-abled
people do and call for appropriate accommodation analogous to ramps
for those using wheelchairs (Oliver 2004; Polvora 2011). The analogies
linking psychiatric with other disabilities is incomplete, however,
nor can accommodations be achieved as easily as installing ramps
(Amundson &amp; Tresky 2007; Rashed 2019).</p>

<p>
Like disability, the deviance eliciting societal censure and
condemnation is also placed in contrast to dysfunction, although
efforts to further characterize that contrast have thus far been
incomplete (Aftab &amp; Rashed 2021).</p>

<h3 id="DysfTwoStagAnal">4.3 Dysfunction in Two Stage Analyses</h3>

<p>
Dysfunction forms a central element of the most widely discussed
analytic definition of mental disorder, introduced in
 <a href="#MentMentDiso">&sect;3</a>.
 The notion of dysfunction applies in two distinct ways in
Wakefield&rsquo;s harmful dysfunction analysis, one way avowedly
objective and the other not (see
 <a href="#FormDefi">&sect;4.4</a>).
 In the first, dysfunction occurs in some part or parts of a bodily or
neural system. That dysfunction in turn causes dysfunction in some
part of the individual&rsquo;s social and personal system (grounding
normative judgments of harmfulness). The first kind of dysfunction
allegedly permits factual description.</p>

<p>
The characteristic dysfunction of mental disorder is here part of a
standard, <em>idiopathic</em> model, as we saw, with disabling traits
understood as symptoms or manifestations of an underlying pathological
process. The suitability of this model for psychiatric conditions has
received persistent critique (see
 <a href="#AntiPsyc">&sect;10.1</a>).
 Recent challenges rest on the persuasiveness of network models
(introduced in
 <a href="#SuffDisa">&sect;4.2</a>),
 where symptomatic dysfunction does not emanate from some disabled
inner mechanism, but instead emerges piecemeal from interacting
experiences that cumulatively build clusters of disabling symptoms out
of feedback loops (Kendler, Zachar, &amp; Craver 2011; Borsboom &amp;
Cramer 2013). Support for this alternative model stems from evidence
that a range of factors combine to bring about disorder:
individualistic risk factors, but also aspects of the broader context
in which the individual finds herself (Bolton 2010; Kirmayer,
Lemelson, &amp; Cummings 2015). A more fundamental critique rejects
the dysfunction analysis of disorder, favoring instead a
madness-as-strategy account, which draws from adaptationism (Garson
2022; see
 <a href="#FormDefi">&sect;4.4</a>
 and the entry on
 <a href="../adaptationism/">Adaptationism</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="FormDefi">4.4 Formal Definitions</h3>

<p>
Eschewing a more formal definition, analyses such as the
&ldquo;distress-impairment&rdquo; one introduced earlier rely on
<em>prototypical</em> cases (Graham 2013), or point to intrinsic
vagueness that must thwart such efforts (Keil, Keuck &amp; Hauswald
2017). Others are more ambitious, proposing analytic definitions in
terms of necessary and sufficient conditions and even encompassing
other medical conditions as well as mental disorders (for those
stressing the inseparability and interdependence of mental and bodily
disorder, no important distinction is acknowledged between mental and
physical disorders [P&acirc;rvan 2015]). Definitions (i)&ndash;(vi)
below are a sample of these efforts. More recent definitions reflect
increasing recognition that the diversity of the category must
frustrate efforts at a covering definition.</p>

<ol type="i">

<li><em>A disease is the interference of a normal biological function
that detracts from the person&rsquo;s survival or reproduction</em>
(Boorse 1977). More recent elaborations on this early version of the
definition emphasize biological function and statistical normality, so
that on a bio-statistical theory, <em>diseases are internal states
that depress a functional ability below species-typical levels
(relative to age and sex)</em> (Boorse 1997). Critiques of this
definition have challenged its aspiration to be value free; its
introduction of an arbitrarily selected reference class; and its
failure to honor the accepted distinction between
&ldquo;disease&rdquo; (with its implied defectiveness) and mere
difference (Bolton 2008).</li>

<li><em>A condition is a mental disorder if and only if (a) the
condition causes some harm or deprivation of benefit to the person as
judged by the standards of the person&rsquo;s culture, and (b) the
condition results from the inability of some internal mechanism to
perform its natural function, wherein a natural function is an effect
that is part of the evolutionary explanation of the existence and
structure of the mechanism</em> (Wakefield 1992, 1997). Critiques of
this definition occur later in this section and in
 <a href="#PhenAppr">Section 5</a>.
 In addition, definitions in evolutionary theoretic terms introduce a
category of innate risk factors that is belied by the way natural,
social, and individual factors are inextricably interwoven in disorder
(Bolton 2008). And the formulation relies on unsubstantiated,
empirical assumptions about the way natural selection underlies
natural function (Lilienfeld &amp; Marino 1995; Murphy &amp; Stich
2000). The cultural relativism in (a) has also been challenged (Gert
&amp; Culver 2004: 421; Bolton 2008). And rather than exhibiting
dysfunction, at least some mental disorders may be explained
relationally, by traits that are <em>mismatched</em> in the
person&rsquo;s context, due to their developmental or evolutionary
features (Garson 2015).</li>

<li><em>A mental malady is a condition of a person, other than his
rational beliefs and desires, such that he is suffering, or at
increased risk of suffering, an evil (death, pain, disability, loss of
freedom or opportunity, or loss of pleasure), in the absence of a
distinct sustaining cause</em> (Gert &amp; Culver 2004). The concept
of a sustaining cause is unacceptably vague and inclusive, permitting
conditions to count as disorders that are not, intuitively, disorders
at all (Murphy 2006). For example, some disorders leave permanent,
non-pathological alterations in the character that outlast any
immediate stressors.</li>

<li><em>A condition is pathological if and only if it is an abnormal
bodily/mental condition that requires medical intervention and that
harms standard members of the species in standard conditions</em>
(Reznek 1987: 163&ndash;4). For criticisms of this definition&rsquo;s
appeal to baseline population norms, and to medical intervention, see
comments on (i), (ii) and (iv) above. Reference to required medical
intervention fails to acknowledge risks of over-medicalization and
over-diagnosis and invokes concerns over enhancement (Savulescu, ter
Meulen, &amp; Kahane 2011)</li>

<li><em>Diseases involve deprivation, but a disease is a depriving
relation rather than a depriving entity, depending on the patient for
its existence&hellip;the person is not conceived as ontologically
diminished or defective because it suffers the deprivation</em>.
Drawing on Augustine&rsquo;s ontology of disease, bodily integrity,
and the human person, Alexandra P&acirc;rvan (2015, 2016) argues that
disease stands in ontologically necessary connection with the patient
as person (from this she derives a treatment approach based on how the
person relates to the disease, and a goal of reconfiguring the person
as deprived but not diminished). This account is limited in its
required adherence to its Augustinian ontology.</li>

<li><em>Mental disorders are biological kinds whose effects lead to
harmful consequences &hellip; more natural kinds of mental disorders
(e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are biological kinds primarily
underwritten by biological mechanisms. More artificial kinds (e.g.,
hysteria, voyeuristic disorder) are social kinds primarily
underwritten by social mechanisms</em> (Tsou 2021: 2&ndash;3).</li>

<li>&hellip; <em>at least some of the forms (of madness) &hellip; are
strategies for solving problems, coping with aspects of the
environment, regulating one&rsquo;s mental economy &hellip; the
creative problem-solving activity of the human mind, or God&rsquo;s
stern but benevolent hand, or the healing impetus of nature, or an
evolutionary adaptation, a purpose-driven process, a well-operated
machine</em> &hellip; (Garson 2022: 10). If neuropsychiatry ever
succeeds in identifying the defective mechanisms it seeks,
Garson&rsquo;s analysis must be weakened. Moreover, it seems
vulnerable to some of the accusations of complexity-defying
oversimplification that have dogged other adaptationist just-so
stories.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="PhenAppr">5. Phenomenological Approaches</h2>

<p>
The symptoms of mental disorder are primarily, if not exclusively,
states about which their subject can claim a sort of authority. Since
subjects can intentionally or unintentionally misreport symptom
states, such phenomenological reports&mdash;however
necessary&mdash;are epistemically limited as data (Kontos 2016).
Psychology can provide reliable behavioral assessments of disorder and
indicate its presence through laboratory performance tests. But no
mental disorder is thus far independently verifiable (though blood
tests or scans, for example). Hence, first person reports play a
special part in understanding mental disorders, for clinicians,
researchers, and philosophers alike (Flanagan 2011; Varga 2015). Karl
Jaspers&rsquo; <em>General Psychopathology</em>, which combines
detailed clinical description with the existential and
phenomenological methods of Husserl and Heidegger, has been widely
discussed. This pairing of clinical and philosophical knowledge makes
Jaspers (1913[1963]) one of the undisputed originators of the research
field known as the philosophy of psychiatry and psychopathology. The
&ldquo;phenomenological&rdquo; clinical approaches following this
broadly Jasperian tradition, however, vary in their adherence to the
tenets of phenomenology (Parnas &amp; Sass 2008).</p>

<p>
The phenomenological strand of philosophical analysis influenced by
thinkers like Husserl and Heidegger focuses on immediate, first person
reports. Analyses have examined self-experience in psychosis (Parnas
&amp; Sass 2008; Madeira, Pienkos, et al. 2019), disordered temporal
experience (Fuchs 2005, 2013), delusional states (Parnas &amp; Sass
2008; Gallagher 2005, 2013), and affective disturbances (Ratcliffe
2008; Ratcliffe &amp; Stephan 2014; Jacobs et. al. 2014). In these
traditions neither psychology nor psychopathology are empirical
sciences in the usual sense because they involve distinctive forms of
explanation. Arising within nineteenth century social science, the
hermeneutical approach involving meanings calls for <em>Verstehen</em>
(understanding), a distinctive, interpretive way of apprehending human
action (Jaspers 1913[1963]; Phillips 2013, Wiggins &amp; Schwartz
2011; Spitzer &amp; Uehlein 1992). These differences of approach bring
differing orientations towards fundamentals, and approaches following
German and French traditions have been contrasted with the
&ldquo;Anglo-empiricist&rdquo; approaches, which display a greater
emphasis on objectivity and empirical science (Mullen 2011; Gergel
2012).</p>

<p>
These differences bring contrasting theories about psychology as
science. Some argue that the subjective life of the patient should be
the main or even sole locus of attention (Stanghellini 2004). Others
argue that the experiences associated with psychosis must be
categorically divorced from more typical psychological processes (Sass
2001; Parnas &amp; Sass 2008). Emphasizing the unique challenges
imposed by interpretation in psychiatry, Somogy Varga (2015) argues
for a hermeneutics distinctive to psychiatry that is grounded in ideas
about the self-interpreting aspect of human beings, &ldquo;mental
disorder&rdquo; thus standing in an asymmetrical relation that
supervenes on our self identities.</p>

<p>
There is disagreement over the correct application of phenomenological
method (Mishara 2007; Sass, Parnas, &amp; Zahavi 2011). But
psychopathology likely offers a challenge so great as to call for a
range of approaches (Ratcliffe 2011; Wiggins and Schwartz 2011;
Gallagher 2013). Attempts have also been made to combine
phenomenological with empirical approaches: Matthew Ratcliffe&rsquo;s
work on affective states employs social research methods (Ratcliffe
2008; Ratcliffe &amp; Stephan 2014). And efforts to tie in
phenomenological theorizing with findings in neuroscience have yielded
the hybrid methodology of phenomenological clinical neuroscience
advocating an initial study of subjective experience to <em>only
then</em> be probed for its underlying neurobiology (Mishara 2007:
34).</p>

<p>
The merging of empirical and phenomenological methodologies is
represented by the fields of embodied and enactive cognition.
Conceptions of the embodied, embedded, and sense-making enactive mind
bring emphasis on the way, shaped by perceptual experience,
consciousness and the first person perspective form the basis of all
mental processing (Varela, Thompson, &amp; Rosch 1991; Durt, Fuchs,
&amp; Tewes 2017; Di Paolo &amp; De Jaegher 2017). Applied to mental
disorder, this departure from classical cognitivist assumptions and
analogies suggests that at least some disorder grows out of
disturbances in embodied interaction with the environment, and not
from dysfunctions occurring in high-level cognitive mechanisms
(Drayson 2009; Stanghellini 2004, 2016; Maiese
 2016).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="Clas">6. Classification</h2>

<p>
While
 <a href="#MentMentDiso">Section 3</a>
 focused on what might separate mental from non-mental disorders, and
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">Section 4</a>
 was concerned with how to separate disordered from non-disordered
states, this section addresses controversies over how different types
of putative mental disorders should be distinguished from one another.
These controversies, like so many about psychiatry, span the
disciplines of medicine, science (including neuroscience and
psychology), and philosophy.</p>

<p>
The DSM and ICD share broad features in providing categorical
taxonomies: each disorder is idiopathic in arising at least in part
from morbid factors within the person, and each is identified
&ldquo;descriptively&rdquo;, using polythetic (disjunctive) criteria
identified with clinical observation (including patients&rsquo;
self-reports). Aside from serving the institutions providing services,
their uniformity is aimed to enhance inter-diagnostician reliability;
and research based on these reliable classifications, it had been
hoped, should eventually allow validation of the categories, although
failure to formulate valid diagnostic categories has been conspicuous
and spurned the creation of alternative classification systems (e.g.,
RDoC, HiTOP).</p>

<p>
Following early work by Carl Hempel (1961) that depicted
psychiatry&rsquo;s claim to scientific status as depending on the
empirical testability of classificatory concepts, much of the
subsequent philosophical discussion of classification has been
critical. These criticisms concede little usefulness to psychiatric
classification, are skeptical of the promise of validity, doubtful of
its methodology and claims to scientific authority, unpersuaded by the
categorical system employed, skeptical about its individualistic and
idiopathic assumptions, and dubious over its claims to value-freedom.
Philosophical analysis has often focused on particular symptom
descriptions, disregarding or disavowing the diagnostic categories of
which they are presumed to be clinical manifestations, in some cases
introducing and employing revised categories such as &ldquo;distress
related conditions&rdquo; (Bolton 2012), &ldquo;body image
disorders&rdquo; (Morris 2013), and &ldquo;real hallucinations&rdquo;
(Ratcliffe 2017). Others have accepted the entities so classified
(Sass et al. 2011).</p>

<p>
Criticisms of the DSM and the ICD question their research purposes and
usefulness, categorical approach to taxonomy, and supposed
value-neutrality (see
 <a href="#ValuMentDiso">&sect;8</a>).
 These criticisms emphasize the presence of multiple overarching
values, including the methodological values intended to facilitate
reliability and validity. Unsupportable values (e.g., homophobia,
misogyny) have also been identified.</p>

<h3 id="ResePurpUsef">6.1 Research Purposes and Usefulness</h3>

<p>
Even by those within psychiatry, it has been widely concluded that as
tools for research, the prevailing classifications are flawed,
producing findings that tend to be inconsistent, non-replicable,
non-specific, or ambiguous, with the categories involved exhibiting
problems of construct and predictive validity, as well as imprecise
phenotypic definitions, widespread heterogeneity, and extensive
comorbidity (Cuthbert &amp; Insel 2013; Poland 2014; Poland &amp; Von
Eckardt 2013; Tsou 2021). In partial defense of DSM-type
classifications, Elizabeth Lalumera (2016) points out that mental
disorders may correspond to theoretically informed, albeit
incompletely understood, <em>concepts</em>, in contrast to descriptive
<em>conceptions</em> sufficient for identification practices in
diagnosis and care.</p>

<p>
In response to the DSM&rsquo;s failure to formulate valid categories,
the <em>Research Domain Criteria</em> (RDoC) defines constructs at
lower levels of analysis than the DSM&rsquo;s favored level of
&ldquo;mental disorders&rdquo;. Separate units of analysis (genes,
cells, circuits, self reports, etc.) are each employed in specific
research domains (e.g., positive and negative valence systems,
cognitive systems, systems for social processes, and
arousal/regulatory systems), and the intersections of units of
analysis with research domains produce segments of a spectrum linking
normal and atypical features. Whether RDoC&rsquo;s goals are
compatible has been questioned, but its aim is to promote both more
accurate research and more effective treatments (Cuthbert &amp; Insel
2013; Tabb 2015, 2019; Perring 2016; Morris et. al. 2022). RDoC has in
turn been criticized, e.g., for assigning disorder to individuals
rather than social context, neglecting personal agency, and assuming
an outdated individualistic model of the self (e.g., see Poland &amp;
Tekin 2017; Tabb 2019).</p>

<h3 id="CateDimeAppr">6.2 Categorical and Dimensional Approaches</h3>

<p>
The DSM and ICD have largely followed a nineteenth century,
Kraepelinian model, where each disease is a discretely bounded entity,
made up of a symptom cluster emanating from underlying organic states
or processes within the individual patient. But the applicability of
this model to mental disorder has been challenged. Some suggest
replacing the broad ideal of validity (involving a relation between
classificatory name and underlying disease) with the narrower concept
of predictive or prognostic validity (Schaffner 2012; Tsou 2015,
2021). Rather than being classified as discrete diseases, some argue
that disorders should be classified dimensionally, e.g., defining
depression by severity levels (Zachar 2014; Poland &amp; Tekin 2017;
Machery 2017).</p>

<p>
Some diagnostic conditions (e.g., PTSD) apparently arise from their
subject&rsquo;s surrounding social, economic, and cultural context.
Even those with more claim to idiopathic genetic, neurological, or
biological causes as predisposing factors are recognized to exhibit a
course more strongly influenced by environmental and epigenetic than
any fixed inherent factors, thereby putting further pressure on the
&ldquo;common cause&rdquo; hypothesis, whereby a syndrome is explained
by a single biological feature or set of features (Borsboom &amp;
Cramer 2013). Against biological reductionistic approaches, the
Network Model approach (Borsboom 2017) classifies psychopathology in
terms of interacting networks of biological, psychological, and social
factors.</p>

<p>
With their hypothesized common causes awaiting discovery, categorical
analyses present problems. But dimensional approaches highlight the
so-called boundary problem (Rashed 2021) of where to assign the line
between normal variation and disorder. Theoretically, the
&ldquo;common cause&rdquo; in categorical analyses serves as an anchor
uniting the disparate and variable observable symptoms making up a
given disorder, which justifies the nomological approach of diagnostic
classifications. Aside from this theoretical solution, categorical
models are similarly beset by boundary (fuzzy edges) problems. The
presence of disorder is preceded and followed by a halo of prodromal
and postdromal symptoms, over which clinical (and everyday) judgements
are often unresolved. In an explicitly normative attempt to resolve an
aspect of the boundary problem as it occurs in social and political
contexts, Mohammed Rashed (2019, 2021) employs criteria governing
recognition of social identities as a guide to pathological
status.</p>

<p>
The collection of disorders enumerated and described in psychiatric
classification systems has prompted alarm over the boundaries of
mental disorder, the erosion of normal mentally healthy states and
variations, and the inappropriate role played by medical psychiatry
(and science) in dictating norms of healthy psychic functioning.
Philosophical criticisms of &ldquo;medicalization&rdquo; emphasize the
increasing influence of neuroscience in transforming cultural
expectations and diminishing individual agency and the power of
dictating psychological norms by the psychopharmacological industry
(Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose &amp; Abi-Rached 2013; Moncrieff 2008;
Sadler 2005, 2013, Whitaker &amp; Cosgrove 2015).</p>

<p>
In contrast to these commonly-voiced apprehensions about
over-medicalization, there remains the persistent charge of
<em>under-</em>diagnosis and <em>under</em>-treatment of those with
diagnosable mental disorder, often attributed to stigma, and to the
socioeconomic status of under-served communities. Epidemiological
findings about the incidence of disorder, as distinct from its
diagnosis, are notoriously insufficient, however, quite apart from a
want of independent biomarkers, due to self-stigma and fear of
discrimination, for example, but also to distorting placebo effects,
and to research methods misleadingly susceptible to false positives
(Jopling 2009; Horwitz &amp; Wakefield 2007; Poland &amp; Von Eckardt
2013). The actual epidemiological data remains opaque and equivocal,
leaving these debates unresolved.</p>

<p>
DSM and ICD classifications have been remarkably influential
worldwide: today, they appear almost immovably permanent. But viewed
within their broader moral, political, and social context, which
includes psychiatry&rsquo;s apparently uneven provision of effective
treatment, the appropriate stance to adopt towards them, as Christian
Perring (2016: 87) has urged, remains critical and skeptical.</p>

<h2 id="NatuKindStat">7. Natural Kind Status</h2>

<p>
Philosophers of science have explored whether all or some mental
illnesses might be classified as natural kinds, the claim made about
particular diagnostic categories or symptom clusters (depression,
schizophrenic disorder, and autism, for example), as well as about
separate symptoms (Cooper 2007; Samuels 2009; Tsou 2021). With
recognition that even the category of biological species would not
meet an essentialist criterion for natural kind status, a
&ldquo;homeostatic property cluster&rdquo; account of natural kinds
has been proposed (Ellis 2001, Murphy 2006, Cooper 2007, Samuels 2009,
Tsou 2016; also see the entry on
 <a href="../Species/">Species</a>).
 A natural kind must be able to ground explanations and inductive
inferences, and enable effective human intervention. Linked by
mechanisms (e.g., molecular, neurobiological, developmental) that
cluster together, the homeostatic aspect of HPC kinds ensures that
disorders are sufficiently stable to yield projectable inferences and
be explanatory (Kincaid and Sullivan 2014, Tsou 2022).</p>

<p>
Psychological categories may resemble biological species in some
respects. However, significant differences are suggested by three
distinct arguments: (i) Some have taken psychological categories to
represent a different order of being (see
 <a href="#PhenAppr">&sect;5</a>),
 with its own distinctive forms of causal explanation (Jaspers
1913[1963]; Bolton 2008; Wiggins &amp; Schwartz 2011; Kusters 2016).
(ii) Others point out that psychological categories can alter, and
eventually even be altered by, the persons they classify, forming
&ldquo;interactive&rdquo; kinds through such looping effects. Hacking
(1995, 1999) argues that mental disorders cannot be natural kinds
because the looping effects generated by their classifications render
them inherently unstable. And (iii), some have tried to show that the
relation between mental illnesses and biological kinds differs
according to the role played by values in establishing the taxa of
mental illness (Wakefield 1992; see
 <a href="#ValuMentDiso">&sect;8</a>).
 None of these differences has gone uncriticized. A thoroughgoing mind
to brain reductionism would reject (i). Regarding (ii), Tsou (2007)
argues that classificatory feedback does not necessarily render mental
disorders unstable, and Khalidi (2010) argues that that some natural
science classifications (e.g., dog) generate looping effects that
require classificatory revisions. In response to (iii), it has been
argued that values also enter into the classification of biological
species, but once we reach the categories of interest, non-evaluative
traits form the observable taxa of such species (Cooper 2007).</p>

<p>
Although the diverse ends to which disorder taxonomies can be put
argue against finding a single answer about the kind status of mental
disorders, focus on the purposes served by disorder language and
categories has proven fruitful: (i) Mental disorders have been
assigned to a category of &ldquo;practical kinds&rdquo;, where
membership in this class depends on some external criterion that is
pragmatically relevant in the clinical context, such as a certain
degree of functional impairment, and remains unrelated to the
underlying structure of the kind (Zachar 2014). Moreover, they may be
further classified according to their status as dimensional, discrete,
and fuzzy kinds, and there is little reason to suppose that each and
all conform to any one of these (Haslam 2002, 2014). (ii) Whether or
not they exhibit the stability required of classifications into true
natural kinds, these disorders do possess the properties relevant, and
sufficiently stable, to guide clinical treatment, &#350;erife Tekin
illustrates, using the lack of illness awareness
(&ldquo;insight&rdquo;) common in patients with some diagnoses (Tekin
2016).</p>

<h2 id="ValuMentDiso">8. Values and Mental Disorder</h2>

<p>
Values have unfailingly played a role in the way mental disorders are
classified, conceptualized, experienced as personal diagnosis, and
treated. Philosophical accounts differ over the possibility of a
value-free science of psychiatry
 (<a href="#EvalNormObjeNatu">&sect;8.1</a>).
 Values also affect societal and personal attitudes towards disorder
and diagnosis, in ways that are more immediate, considerably more
urgent, and morally consequential
 (<a href="#SociPersAttiTowaDisoDiag">&sect;8.2</a>).
 Some of these issues are dealt with in bioethical research directed
specifically towards psychiatry
 (<a href="#PsycBioeNeur">&sect;8.3</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="EvalNormObjeNatu">8.1 Evaluativism (Normativism) and Objectivism (Naturalism)</h3>

<p>
Present day conceptions, classifications, and attributions of mental
disorder contain many values, some explicit, others implicit, some
moral, others non-moral. Unacceptable bias has been repeatedly
identified, exemplified in categories such as homosexuality (with its
homophobia), pre-menstrual syndrome (unwarrantedly assigning disorder
status to normal function), masochistic personality disorder
(pathologizing misogynist gender roles), and oppositional defiant
conduct disorders (exhibiting racial bias) (Sadler 2005, 2013; Potter
2014; Poland 2014, Gagn&eacute;-Julien 2021). As in all medicine, the
prefixes of &ldquo;illness&rdquo;and &ldquo;disorder,&rdquo; like
&ldquo;disease,&rdquo; already declare values such as the preference
for health over ill-health. A theory of <em>values based medicine</em>
(VBM) emphasizes that values governing mental health are particularly
contentious, requiring distinctive forms of negotiation in clinical
practice (Fulford 2004, 2014).</p>

<p>
A central philosophical question is whether moral values are
inescapably attached to the conceptualization and classification of
mental disorders at the level of theorizing, forming an inherent part
of their definition. Such &ldquo;evaluativism&rdquo;
(&ldquo;normativism&rdquo;, or &ldquo;constructivism&rdquo;) is placed
in contrast to &ldquo;objectivism&rdquo; (&ldquo;naturalism&rdquo;),
which seeks a value-free account of mental disorder. Debates over
these questions have long dominated philosophical research on mental
disorder, many played out around attempts to define mental disorder in
ways that are value-free (see
 <a href="#DisoMentDiso">&sect;4</a>;
 also see the entry on
 <a href="../medicine/">Philosophy of Medicine</a>,
 &sect;1).</p>

<p>
As discussed in
 <a href="#FormDefi">Section 4.4</a>,
 philosophical definitions aiming to avoid all values appeal to
allegedly value-neutral statistical norms, and adaptive function,
respectively. The vulnerability in Boorse&rsquo;s (1997) statistical
definition, where normal function is determined according to the
person&rsquo;s reference class identified by such criteria as age, and
sex, lies both with assigning the appropriate reference class, a
process that re-introduces values, and at the point on a continuous
distribution curve where deviance from the mean is granted the status
of dysfunctional (Bolton 2008). Recognizing that a trait may be
dysfunctional in evolutionary terms without being disvalued, and
disvalued without being evidence of dysfunction, Wakefield&rsquo;s
two-part definition explicitly accommodates the evaluative element
marking the category. This attempt to provide a naturalistic and value
free evolution-based account of &ldquo;function&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dysfunction&rdquo; has been subject to a range of damaging
objections, including the claim that with its preference for
evolutionary fitness, biological dysfunction is not, as promised,
value neutral, even in the first half of the definition. Discerning
what would be the maximal response in terms of perpetuating the
species represents another of these objections, since no agreed-upon
conclusion about this can be drawn in a value-neutral, or perhaps any,
way (Murphy &amp; Stich 2000; Faucher &amp; Forest 2021; Tsou 2021;
Garson 2022). Critiques of more general disease definitions are also
applicable mental disorder (Powell &amp; Scarffe 2019).</p>

<p>
Evaluativism and objectivism are customarily depicted as incompatible
contraries, although the different domains where claims about disorder
occur (including ordinary usage; conceptually clean versions of
&ldquo;health&rdquo; and &ldquo;disease&rdquo;; the operationalization
of dysfunction and the justification for that operationalization)
indicate the need for a more nuanced analysis of the role of values in
health and disease (Kingma 2014). The broad contrast between
evaluativism and objectivism has also been resisted for other reasons.
Judgments about mental disorder need not be entirely arbitrary and
subjective as long as those values are taken to be real features of
the world along the lines of McDowell&rsquo;s secondary property value
realism, for example. In this relaxed naturalism, objectivism implies
that there is no privileged perspective for identifying the correct
values relevant for psychopathology (Thornton 2007).</p>

<h3 id="SociPersAttiTowaDisoDiag">8.2 Societal and Personal Attitudes Towards Disorder and Diagnosis</h3>

<p>
The present discussion concerns evaluations that are primarily
negative, although as we saw earlier, positive evaluations arise in
traditions valorizing madness, and many in the neuro-diversity
movement insist that autism spectrum and other mental disorders are
unexceptional human variations analogous to differences of gender,
which ought to be granted respectful accommodation, not clinical
treatment (Hoffman 2019; Chapman &amp; Carel 2022). Negative social
attitudes towards observable disorder have led to stigma, self-stigma,
and discrimination (Hinshaw 2009). The madman and madwoman have been
the subject of fear, misunderstanding, disparagement and condemnation,
their failings exaggerated and humanity denied (Gilman 1985). With
modernity, care and protection apparently replaced earlier, moralistic
and neglectful arrangements (the reforms&rsquo; real effects and costs
remain an unsettled matter of historical
 debate).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 At the same time formal exceptions and protections, such as the
insanity defense, recognized mental disorder as an exculpating excuse
for wrongdoing and negligence. Despite such attitudinal change,
however, these issues around responsibility remain contentious and
unresolved (Pouncey &amp; Lukens 2010; Singh, Sinnott-Armstrong &amp;
Savulescu 2013; Schramme 2014).</p>

<p>
The consequences of being diagnosed has been demonstrated to be
extensive, often personally transformative, and usually not benign.
The extent of these effects has drawn research attention to
first-person report and to the eloquent madness memoirs increasingly
available for study. It has led to theorizing within formal
philosophical writing, and also within the rhetoric of social
movements and identity-focused political interest groups (see
 <a href="#AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">&sect;10</a>).
 The Recovery movement, for example, stresses the way the self and
identity are diminished by diagnosis, which erodes and occludes
equally important and more positive, attributes making up the whole
person (Davidson 2013). Critiques of diagnosis place emphasis on its
dehumanizing and &ldquo;objectifying&rdquo; effects that, magnified by
stigmatizing societal attitudes, engender self-stigma (Hoffman &amp;
Hansen 2017; Hinshaw 2009; Thornicroft 2006). More recently, however,
social media and our hyperconnected contemporary existence have
contributed to a less stigmatizing and discriminatory world, by
shifting discussions about &lsquo;pathological diagnoses&rsquo; to
positive social identities (Sulik 2011).</p>

<h3 id="PsycBioeNeur">8.3 Psychiatric Bioethics and Neuroethics</h3>

<p>
Societal attitudes towards mental disorders (including features
associated with disorders themselves) have given rise to a distinctive
psychiatric bioethics that differs from traditional medical bioethics.
Widespread stigma about disorders raises extra privacy and
confidentiality issues, for example. Because of the powerful and
disruptive effects of the experience of disorder, conceptions of
disorder and its treatment are often linked to the self and identity
of the subject in distinctive ways (Tekin 2019). The compromised
perceptual, affective, and reasoning capabilities that at least
temporarily mark severe disorder are seen to jeopardize the
widely-valued traits of rational autonomy, responsibility, and
coherent and unified personhood, leading to challenges over agency and
decisional capacity (Radoilska 2012; Sadler, Fulford, &amp; van Staden
2015). Finally, the fact that psychiatric treatment sometimes involves
coercion raises unique ethical issues.</p>

<p>
Coercive practices are judged of serious moral concern. For example,
coercive treatment seems to jeopardize rights proclaimed by the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006).
Important philosophical issues here include whether there are
person-centered or paternalist principles that would respectively
obviate or justify coercive treatment; how to define coercion; what
constitutes valid consent; and identifying links between coercion and
stigma (Kallert, Mezzich, &amp; Monahan 2011; Szmukler 2016; Cratsley
2019; Pouncey &amp; Mertz 2019). Recent theorists have discussed
&ldquo;mental disorder exceptionalism&rdquo; (different treatment for
mental and physical conditions) and proposed potential tests for
drawing relevant distinctions (Szmukler &amp; Dawson 2011).</p>

<p>
Aside from legal and moral liability, disorders affecting volition
(e.g., addictive and compulsive disorders) have been considered in
light of the moral capacities associated with attributing full adult
responsibility. Efforts to ground the intuition that sufferers from
these conditions are less than fully responsible agents have appealed
to &ldquo;deep self&rdquo; and also &ldquo;reasons
responsiveness&rdquo; theories of responsibility. Neither theory alone
has been found to readily accommodate the collection of symptoms
associated with this group of disorders (Schramme 2014; Summers &amp;
Sinnott-Armstrong 2019).</p>

<p>
The related field of neuroethics explores developments and prospects
in neuroscience that are particularly urgent and relevant for
psychopathology (Bluhm, Jacobson, &amp; Maibom 2012; Roskies 2007;
Glannon 2015; Caruso &amp; Flanagan 2018). For example, encroachment
on &ldquo;mental privacy&rdquo; can be expected to disproportionately
affect those with stigmatized genders, disorders and symptoms; and a
future can be envisioned in which the semantic authority of first
person symptom descriptions is undermined by diagnoses independently
verified through imaging or other technologies (Maibom 2012). More
generally, this new knowledge seems likely to foster a trend from the
treatment of disorder to its prediction based on observed risk
factors, which in turn permits initiatives such as the identification
and treatment of early onset, &ldquo;prodromal&rdquo; conditions in
younger subjects (children and youth), likely affecting identity
development and self-management (Broome, Fusar-Poli, &amp; Wuyts 2013;
Whitaker &amp; Cosgrove 2015; Radden 2018; also see the entries on
 <a href="../neuroscience/">Philosophy of Neuroscience</a>
 and
 <a href="../neuroethics/">Neuroethics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Concepts of <em>responsibility</em>, together with concepts of
<em>personhood</em>, <em>autonomy</em>, <em>diminished capacity</em>,
and <em>individual rights</em>, make up an inescapable aspect of the
broad field of psychiatric ethics. Areas of recent research concern
responsibility and blame. Attitudes of blame are customarily treated
as an appropriate sequel to assigning responsibility (Watson 2004),
but Hanna Pickard (2011) uncouples responsibility from blame. For the
apparently willful behavior of those diagnosed with disorders
affecting agency, she argues, the proper stance for the care-giver is
grounded in an empathetic attitude (that assigns responsibility
without blaming), which is conducive to improvement and recovery.</p>

<p>
Closely related responsibility issues involve the personality
disorders that&mdash;due to their long-recognized relationship to more
normal character weaknesses and their evidently dimensional
nature&mdash;sit uneasily within psychiatric classifications
(Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Pickard 2011, 2016). One DSM grouping
(cluster B personality disorders, including borderline, narcissistic
and antisocial), are better approached using persuasion and methods
reminiscent of the &ldquo;moral treatment&rdquo; of earlier times
(Charland 2004).</p>

<p>
Philosophical challenges to customary moral, ethical, and medical
presuppositions introduced in this section have been influenced by,
and are difficult to separate from, critiques of medical psychiatry
that have taken place not only within academe, but also beyond it (see
 <a href="#AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">&sect;10</a>).</p>
 
<h2 id="PartPsyc">9. Particular Disorders</h2>

<p>
While often more ambitious and encompassing, philosophical attempts to
define or characterize mental disorder have also provided
finer-grained analyses (See Fulford et al., 2013; Moseley &amp; Gala
2016; Tekin &amp; Bluhm 2019). Beyond research into schizophrenia,
which is the most plausible candidate of a natural kind, analyses have
been offered for <em>anorexia and other eating disorders</em> (Gadsby
2017a, 2017b, 2020; Bordo 1993; Giordano 2005, 2019; Svenaeus 2013;
Morris 2013; Tan, Hope &amp; Stewart 2003; Tan et al. 2010; Radden
2021); <em>addiction</em> (West 2006; Poland &amp; Graham 2011;
Flanagan 2017; Vohs &amp; Heatherton 2000; Levy, 2006, 2011, 2013;
Foddy &amp; Savalescu 2010; Holton &amp; Berridge 2013; Kennett 2013;
Lewis 2015; Summers 2015; Pickard 2016; Sripada 2018; Westin 2020;
Glackin, Roberts, &amp; Krueger 2021); <em>anti-social personality
disorder</em> (Fuchs 2001, 2005, 2013; Roskies 2003; Levy 2007;
Kennett &amp; Fine 2008; Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Adshead 2013; Maibom
2014; Schramme 2014; Justman 2021); <em>depressive and
manic-depressive conditions</em> (Horwitz &amp; Wakefield 2007; Radden
2009, 2013; Biegler 2011; Bluhm 2011; Bluhm, Jacobson, &amp; Maibom
2012; Radoilska 2012; Wakefield 2012; Bolton 2013; Ratcliffe &amp;
Stephan 2014; Varga 2016; Hoffman &amp; Hansen 2017; Browne 2018);
<em>scrupulosity, obsessive-compulsive, and other volitional
disorders</em> (Glas, 2013; Szalai 2016; Summer &amp;
Sinnott-Armstrong 2019); <em>anxiety</em> (Horwitz &amp; Wakefield
2012); <em>autism spectrum conditions</em> (Adams 2013; Baron-Cohen,
Lombardo, &amp; Tager-Flusberg 2013); <em>dissociative disorders</em>
(Maiese 2016; Worrell &amp; Denham 2016); <em>defiance disorders</em>
(Potter 2014); <em>borderline personality disorder</em> (Potter 2009);
and <em>premenstrual dysphoric disorder</em> (Gagn&eacute;-Julien
2021).</p>

<p>
The category of <em>psychosis</em>&mdash;which includes
<em>delusions</em> (false beliefs that resist reality testing) and
<em>hallucinations</em> (most often auditory)&mdash;has received
considerable philosophical attention. With almost unfailing
consequences for their subject in clinical, legal, social, and
personal settings, the severity of hallucinations and delusions
distinguishes them from the more controversial disorders noted thus
far. The incidence of and pathology associated with hallucinations has
been questioned, as has their origins and phenomenology (Leudar &amp;
Thomas 2000; Henriksen, Raballo, &amp; Parnas 2015; Ratcliffe 2017).
And delusions have attracted the particular attention of philosophers
for their incomprehensibility and challenges for theories about
meaning, language, belief, and intention (Coltheart &amp; Davies 2000;
Bortolotti 2009, 2020; Fletcher &amp; Frith 2009; Miyazono 2019; Evans
2023). They have also been the impetus for important collaborative
work between several sciences: in addition to being psychiatric
disorders, delusions occur as symptoms of neurological diseases and
brain injury, which have made them subject to considerable empirical
study. Philosophical research on delusions primarily addresses issues
their intelligibility, their status in relation to more normal
doxastic states, and their place in explanatory models.</p>

<p>
The intelligibility of delusions remains contested. Delusions are
expressed using unexceptional syntax, and some involve content that,
while inaccurate or implausible, is entirely comprehensible. These,
Jaspers insisted, are secondary delusions; primary delusions, in
contrast, are distinguished by their meaninglessness: attributing
meaning to them is a misapplication of the hermeneutic approach
(Jaspers 1913 [1963]; Gorski 2012). Others argue that all delusions
are meaningless utterances (Berrios 1991), which is supported by
findings from neuroscience (Gerrans 2014). In contrast, some argue
that delusions are always comprehensible, but only when contextualized
to a person&rsquo;s entire life, ideas, and values (Bentall 2004;
Mullen &amp; Gillett 2014; Glover 2014; Wickham &amp; Bentall 2016;
Jeppsson 2021; Gipps 2022).</p>

<p>
Delusions are belief-like, but disagreements arise over whether they
are beliefs, imaginings, an incomplete form of one of these two, or a
distinct hybrid form. The doxastic position (delusions are beliefs)
must somehow accommodate the fact that delusions are not responsive to
countervailing evidence and are only weakly behavior guiding (see
Flores 2021 and the entry on
 <a href="../delusion/">Delusion</a>).
 Associated more with imagining than with believing, these same
features have led to the assertion that delusions are imaginings
mistakenly identified as beliefs (Currie &amp; Ravenscroft 2002;
Broome &amp; Bortolotti 2009) or the hybrid concept of
&ldquo;bimagining&rdquo; (Egan 2009).</p>

<p>
Increasingly, explanations of delusions are multi-factorial.
Influential early models that grew out of research on single-themed
delusions resulting from brain damage (e.g., Capgras) hypothesized two
deficiencies. The first factor is an initiating aberrant experience or
perception due to brain dysfunction, combined with some failure of the
system of &ldquo;belief fixation&rdquo; by which initial beliefs are
critically reviewed in light of other information (Davies et al. 2001;
Aimola Davies &amp; Davies 2009; Young 2011). The second factor in
such &ldquo;two factor&rdquo; theories is faulty inference, which in
some accounts is conceptualized as differing in degree (alone) from
normal forms of reasoning error, such as attribution bias (Bentall
2004). In &ldquo;prediction error&rdquo; models, perceptual
aberrations conflict with prior (Bayesian) expectations when
accompanied by reasoning bias, giving rise to delusions (Stone &amp;
Young 2007; Mishara &amp; Corlett 2009). The
&ldquo;polythematic&rdquo; and complex delusions more often seen in
the psychiatry clinic&mdash;which are partially driven by social and
environmental factors&mdash;present significant challenges for
cognitive science since they involve the higher cognitive systems that
apparently resist modular analysis and decomposition.</p>

<h2 id="AntiPsycFemiTheoPostCritPsycNeurIdenPoli">10. Anti-psychiatry, Feminist Theory, Post- and Critical- Psychiatry, Neurodiversity and Identity Politics</h2>

<h3 id="AntiPsyc">10.1 Anti-psychiatry</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Anti-psychiatry&rdquo; has come to stand for ideas from
mid-twentieth century thinkers such as Thomas Szasz, R.D. Laing, and
Michel Foucault. Many of these involved social and political critiques
and calls to action, with real-world consequences that have been
linked to deinstitutionalization, human rights movements, and a shift
towards more autonomy-focused mental health care. Szasz and Laing
rejected the appropriateness of analogizing particular &ldquo;problems
in living&rdquo; (Szasz) with medical disorders, insisting that
misapplication of the medical model to mental health was emblematic of
the overreach of psychiatry. The practices and discourses within
society and its institutions making up the era&rsquo;s
<em>episteme</em> are depicted historically by Foucault, the focus on
the exercise of psychiatric power that, arising with modern science,
is increasingly exerted through mechanisms of protection,
surveillance, and control. With modernity, on this account, power is
no longer brute force. Instead, it takes a more diffused and subtle
form that imperceptibly disciplines and controls not only bodies, but
selves (Foucault 1965; Rose 2009; Bracken &amp; Thomas 2010, 2013;
Iliopoulos 2012). Foucault&rsquo;s sweeping ideas remain central to
the &ldquo;post psychiatry&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical
psychiatry&rdquo; that emerged during the beginning of the
twenty-first century.</p>

<h3 id="FemiTheo">10.2 Feminist Theory</h3>

<p>
Interwoven with these ideas have been critiques from feminism and
feminist theory. These include acknowledgment of the women&rsquo;s
actual and unwarranted institutionalization, emphasis on the harms of
disempowerment and silencing (Kristeva 1987 [1989]), and discussions
of epistemic injustice (Dotson 2011; Kidd, Spencer &amp; Carel 2022;
also see the entry on
 <a href="../feminist-social-epistemology/">Feminist Social Epistemology</a>).
 In a legacy affecting mental disorder even today, binary
conceptualizations have assigned women and the feminine to
illogicality, emotionality, subjectivity, the body, and
madness&mdash;in contrast to men&rsquo;s more valued traits (Lloyd
1984; Potter 2009). Feminist thinkers have focused on the
medicalization of women&rsquo;s normal traits; neglected and distorted
research into gender-linked disorders; separate and unequal treatments
for women; the mental health vulnerabilities associated with
traditional women&rsquo;s roles and identities; and diagnosis and
treatment understood as tools of patriarchal social control (Russell
1995; Ussher 2011; Gagn&eacute;-Julien 2021).</p>

<p>
Feminism has consistently rejected traditional causal explanations of
women&rsquo;s disorder derived from allegedly natural biological
predispositions, pointing instead to the effects of women&rsquo;s
oppressive socialization and to the consequences of devaluing
women&rsquo;s characteristics and abilities (Bluhm 2011). Some have
emphasized the embodiment (and relationality) of the self and avoided
the methodological individualism associated with psychiatric medicine
(Bluhm, Jacobson, &amp; Maibom 2012). Influenced by social theory and
phenomenological approaches, more recent work focuses on the
intersection of gender with marginality, invisibility,
non-normativity, and oppression in lived experience (Nissim-Sabat
2013; Zeiler &amp; Folkmarson K&auml;ll 2014).</p>

<h3 id="PostCritPsyc">10.3 Post and Critical Psychiatry</h3>

<p>
Proponents of <em>post psychiatry</em> reject both the modernist
presuppositions of psychiatry and the assumption that disorder
reflects flawed brain mechanisms or processes, arguing that these
assumptions only serve to enhance the status of psychiatry and
disempower those diagnosed with disorder (Bracken &amp; Thomas 2005,
Iliopoulos 2012). The new brain sciences will magnify this
disempowerment, it is argued, with the agency and authority previously
assigned to persons will be replaced by a bio-scientific
&ldquo;management of the mind&rdquo; (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose and
Abi-Rached 2013). A more recent descendant of critical mid-twentieth
century writing is <em>critical psychiatry</em>: critiques of the
influence of the pharmacological industry (Phillips 1996, 2013;
Moncrieff 2008; Whitaker &amp; Cosgrove 2015; Karp 2017); a discourse
around mental disorder that, influenced by hermeneutics, aims to be
more sensitive to the meaning of symptoms (Bracken &amp; Thomas 2010);
and the promotion of a more equal and collaborative relationship
between carers and those they treat (Double 2006; Cohen &amp; Timimi
2008).</p>

<p>
Associated with these ideas is growing recognition of the unique
expertise of &ldquo;service users&rdquo; or &ldquo;survivors&rdquo;
for understanding mental disorder and the importance of its inclusion
for research (Faulkner &amp; Leyzell 2000; Gergel 2012; Cooper 2017;
Bueter 2018). These innovations have appealed to resources from
critical theory, narrative research methods, the impediments to
representational authority, and the co-production of knowledge
(Voronka 2016; Russo &amp; Sweeney 2016).</p>

<h3 id="Neur">10.4 Neurodiversity</h3>

<p>
As the most recent among this range of broadly &lsquo;anti
psychiatry&rsquo; positions, neurodiversity offers a coherent account
and has come of age within a cultural <em>episteme</em> that seems
hospitable to it. Mental differences, it asserts, are equally natural
and valuable, and no one type of functioning is more correct or valid
than another. Analogies are drawn with differences of gender,
ethnicity, and culture&mdash;including analogies involving social
power inequalities. From its ready application to disorders on the
autism spectrum, efforts have been made to apply the neurodiversity
position more broadly, including to the symptoms of schizophrenia
(Washington 2016, Chapman 2019, Chapman &amp; Carel 2022).</p>

<h3 id="IdenPoli">10.5 Identity Politics</h3>

<p>
Claims arising from political movements made up of recipients of
psychiatric care call for a seat at the policy-makers&rsquo; table;
representational authority in the co-production of knowledge based on
first person experience of psychiatric symptoms and treatment;
attention to complaints of unjust treatment by the
&ldquo;survivors&rdquo; of diagnosis and care; equality of mental
health care with other disabilities or medical conditions; recognition
of neuro-atypicality from proponents of a neurodiversity model of
disorder (Ortega 2009; Polvora 2011); and from &ldquo;mad
pride&rdquo;, the claim that madness is an attribution from which to
draw strength and cultural identity. Largely neglected until now
within psychiatry or philosophical writing, the claims of mad pride
have recently been critically evaluated and related to the social
theory of philosophers, such as Axel Honneth and Charles Taylor
(Rashed 2019, 2021).</p>

<h2 id="FutuPros">11. Future Prospects</h2>

<p>
Where might we expect philosophical work on mental disorder to go from
here? One issue must be what role remains for conceptual analysis and
commonsense psychology. Relatedly, whose standards should determine
mental health? Modern science, and the merciless dictates of biology,
or some richer eudaemonic vision? Even granted the authority to
determine ideals of mental health, philosophers would encounter hard
questions. How should we relinquish evaluative thinking in view of
liberal traditions around responsibility and self identity? How
generously should we be in attributing normalcy and diversity, rather
than deficiency? How should we navigate the boundary of disorder and
risk? New ways to understand, identify, and ameliorate mental
disorders&mdash;along with technological advances that simultaneously
permit new analyses of big data and exacerbate the hyperconnectedness
of society&mdash;can only augment and extend such questions, perhaps
in unimagined directions.</p>
