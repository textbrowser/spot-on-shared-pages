<h1>The Identity of Indiscernibles</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jun 4, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The Identity of Indiscernibles is the thesis that there cannot be
numerical difference without extra-numerical difference&mdash;that is,
there cannot be two objects that differ only numerically, <em lang="la">solo
numero</em>. It is an important issue in metaphysical
discussions of identity, haecceitism/non-haecceitism, and theories of
properties (since extra-numerical identity is often explained in terms
of properties). Although it is most often referred to as a
<em>principle</em>, its axiomatic character is not currently a topic
of discussion, and the fact that it is referred to as such is simply
due to Leibniz&rsquo;s influence.</p>

<h2 id="BriHisIdeInd">1. Brief History of the Identity of Indiscernibles</h2>

<p>
The Identity of Indiscernibles has long been a topic of philosophical
reflection. For instance, the Stoics and Nicholas of Cusa maintained
the Identity of Indiscernibles, and Aquinas asserted it of separated
intelligences, i.e., non-material minds. But it was Leibniz who made
the Identity of Indiscernibles a distinctive topic of philosophical
reflection. Indeed, by producing arguments for and from it, and by
making it a central element of his influential philosophical system,
Leibniz made the Identity of Indiscernibles more salient to his
contemporaries and successors (for discussion of the role and place of
the Identity of Indiscernibles in Leibniz&rsquo;s system, and his
arguments for and from it, see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2014). After Leibniz,
philosophers of the calibre of Kant, Bolzano, Russell, Wittgenstein,
and MacTaggart all discussed the Identity of Indiscernibles. And in
the mid twentieth century it was Max Black, in a now classic article
published in <em>Mind</em>, who, by putting forward a provocative, if
not completely original, thought experiment, produced a renewal of
interest in the Identity of Indiscernibles and set much of the agenda
for discussion of it since the 1950s onwards (see Black 1952).
Black&rsquo;s thought experiment consists in conceiving a universe
where there are only two iron spheres, at a certain distance from each
other, having the same diameter as each other, the same colour as each
other, the same temperature as each other, etc. If such a universe is
possible then the Identity of Indiscernibles is not true. The Identity
of Indiscernibles has continued to be discussed since then up until
the present.</p>

<h2 id="ForIdeInd">2. Formulation of the Identity of Indiscernibles</h2>

<p>
As stated above, the Identity of Indiscernibles is the thesis that
there cannot be numerical difference without extra-numerical
difference. There is numerical difference between any objects when
those objects are not one, i.e., when they, taken collectively, are
more than one. Thus, the Identity of Indiscernibles means that,
necessarily, any two objects differ other than merely numerically. The
three elements of this thesis, the modal operator, the domain of the
quantifier (objects), and the relation that is said to obtain between
any two members of that domain (extra-numerical difference) are open
to variation and/or interpretation, and any such variation or
interpretation produces a different version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles.</p>

<p>
Let us start with extra-numerical difference. Two objects differ
numerically when they differ with respect to which objects they are,
while they differ extra-numerically when they differ with respect to
how they are. One can interpret extra-numerical difference in terms of
properties, or in terms of similarity. On the first interpretation,
two objects differ extra-numerically when they differ with respect to
some property. On the second interpretation, two objects differ
extra-numerically when they don&rsquo;t resemble exactly. In the
contemporary discussion of the Identity of Indiscernibles
extra-numerical difference is invariably understood in the former way.
However, it is interesting to note that Leibniz typically formulated
the Identity of Indiscernibles in terms of perfect similarity, e.g.:
&ldquo;It is not true that two substances <em>resemble each other</em>
<em>entirely</em> and differ <em lang="la">solo numero</em>&rdquo;
(Leibniz 1686: &sect;9 [2020: 14]). The former conception of
extra-numerical difference is the focus in what follows, given its
dominance in the contemporary discussion of the Identity of
Indiscernibles.</p>

<p>
With extra-numerical difference thus understood, the Identity of
Indiscernibles can take a very weak form, namely as stating that,
necessarily, any two objects must differ in at least one property. In
other words:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em" id="item1">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects share all their properties.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But, as has been noted innumerable times, although this thesis is
true, it is trivially true (e.g., Adams 1979: 11, Van Cleve 2002:
389&ndash;90, to mention just two philosophers who have made the
point). For no two objects, \(a\) and \(b\), can share all their
properties. For if they did, they would also share their properties of
identity (i.e., the properties of <em>being identical with</em> \(a\)
and <em>being identical with</em> \(b\)) and their properties of
difference (e.g., the properties of <em>being numerically different
from</em> \(a\) and <em>being numerically different from</em> \(b\)),
and many other similar properties. But if they shared these
properties, \(a\) and \(b\) would not be two objects. Therefore,
necessarily, any two objects must differ in at least some such
properties&mdash;but that any two objects differ at least with respect
to their properties of identity and difference is a triviality.</p>

<p>
But this trivial thesis is not even a version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles, since differing with respect to properties of
identity, properties of difference, and similar ones, is differing
numerically. Indeed, for objects to differ with respect to properties
of identity and properties of difference is for them to differ with
respect to which objects they are, not to differ with respect to how
they are; but what the Identity of Indiscernibles requires is that
every two objects differ with respect to how they are, that is, it
requires that they differ extra-numerically.</p>

<p>
Whether or not
 <a href="#item1">(1)</a>
 should count as a version of the Identity of Indiscernibles,
properties of identity and properties of difference are not the only
properties that trivialize it. For instance, properties like <em>being
a member of {a}</em> and <em>being identical with a and being
green</em> also trivialize (1). There is thus the problem of finding a
characterization of the properties that trivialize (1). Roughly, a
trivializing property is one that differing with respect to it does
not require differing extra-numerically, while a non-trivializing
property is one that is not trivializing, i.e., a property that
differing with respect to it requires differing extra-numerically. So,
for objects to differ with respect to a non-trivializing property is
for them to differ with respect to how they are and not merely with
respect to which objects they are. (For more specific proposals about
the characterization of non-trivializing properties see Katz 1983;
Rodriguez-Pereyra 2022: 50&ndash;51.)</p>

<p>
Thus, to formulate a non-trivial version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles, or indeed to formulate a version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles at all, one needs to either vary or interpret
differently the notion of property (and thereby the notion of
extra-numerical difference). For instance, some philosophers take
properties to be universals that make a causal difference to their
possessors (e.g., Armstrong 1997). Now, since on such a conception of
properties there are no properties corresponding to predicates like
&ldquo;is identical with \(a\)&rdquo;, &ldquo;is numerically different
from \(b\)&rdquo;, etc., on such conception of properties the thesis
that, necessarily, no two objects share all their properties is not a
triviality.</p>

<p>
But one could still have a very broad notion of property, on which
there are such properties as <em>being identical with</em> \(a\) and
<em>being numerically different from \(b\)</em>, and decide to
restrict the properties referred to in the Identity of Indiscernibles
to properties that do not render it trivially true. There are several
ways in which one could implement this strategy, but in the
contemporary discussion the most common one is to restrict the
Identity of Indiscernibles to so-called <em>pure</em>, or <em>purely
qualitative</em>, properties. Different philosophers have different
conceptions of pure properties, but the general idea is that pure
properties are those that &ldquo;do not mention&rdquo; any particular
object. For instance, <em>being red</em>, <em>being next to a
tower</em>, and <em>being a lover</em> are pure properties, while
<em>being next to the Eiffel Tower</em> and <em>being a lover of
Napoleon</em> are impure properties, since they &ldquo;mention&rdquo;
particular objects, i.e., the Eiffel Tower and Napoleon (for
discussion of pure properties and how to characterize them precisely
see, among others, Adams 1979: 7; Cowling 2015a; Khamara 1988; Plate
2022; and Rodriguez-Pereyra 2022: 21&ndash;27). Another option
consists in restricting the properties referred to in the Identity of
Indiscernibles to intrinsic properties&mdash;roughly, those properties
such that having them does not depend on how their possessors are
related to anything external to them. The literature on the
distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties is huge, but no
proposed distinction seems to be entirely satisfactory. Nevertheless,
on any plausible account of extrinsic properties, these include many
relational properties (e.g., those relational properties that objects
have in virtue of relations to external objects, as opposed to
relational properties had in virtue of relations objects bear to
themselves or their parts). The version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles produced by this restriction is usually associated with
Leibniz (N.B.: for Leibniz quantitative differences are extrinsic
differences and so, in his philosophy, the idea that necessarily, no
two objects share all their intrinsic properties entails that,
necessarily, no two objects differ in size alone).</p>

<p>
But some impure properties do not trivialize
 <a href="#item1">(1)</a>,
 for instance properties like <em>being next to the Eiffel tower</em>
and <em>being a lover of Napoleon</em>, since objects that differ with
respect to them differ with respect to how they are and not merely
with respect to which objects they are: in one case they differ with
respect to how close they are to Eiffel Tower, and in the other they
differ with respect to their romantic feelings about Napoleon. Thus,
there is also room for a version of the Identity of Indiscernibles
that restricts its properties simply to those that do not trivialize
(1). Hence, we have the following three versions of the Identity of
Indiscernibles:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt id="PII">(PII)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects share all their non-trivializing
properties.</dd>
<dt id="PIIa">(PIIa)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects share all their pure properties.</dd>
<dt id="PIIb">(PIIb)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects share all their intrinsic pure
properties.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Given the considerations above, the non-trivializing properties
consist of all the pure properties and some impure properties. Thus,
the class of pure properties is included in the class of
non-trivializing properties, and therefore
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 entails
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>&mdash;that
 is, (PIIa) cannot be true unless (PII) is true. And since the class
of intrinsic pure properties is included both in the class of pure
properties and the class of non-trivializing properties,
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 entails both (PIIa) and (PII)&mdash;that is, (PIIb) cannot be true
unless both (PIIa) and (PII) are true. There are no other entailment
relations between these theses. Thus (PIIb) is the strongest version
of the three, and (PII) is the weakest of the three. Indeed, given
that
 <a href="#item1">(1)</a>
 is not a version of the Identity of Indiscernibles, there is no
version of the Identity of Indiscernibles weaker than (PII).</p>

<p>
Orthogonal to this distinction, there is another distinction between
versions of the Identity of Indiscernibles, based on work by Quine in
which he distinguishes three different kinds of discernibility:
absolute, relative, and weak discernibility (Quine 1960, 1976). Given
these distinctions, one can distinguish the three following versions
of the Identity of Indiscernibles:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag5em">
<dt id="PIIQa">(PIIQa)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects satisfy exactly the same open
sentences with one free variable.</dd>
<dt id="PIIQr">(PIIQr)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects satisfy exactly the same open
sentences with two free variables in both orders.</dd>
<dt id="PIIQw">(PIIQw)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, no two objects satisfying exactly the same open
sentences with two free variables are such that each one of them
satisfies all of them with respect to itself.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The notion of weak discernibility, the notion featuring in the third
version of the Identity of Indiscernibles just distinguished, has been
much discussed in recent years, especially in relation to the
indiscernibility of physical particles (see, for instance, Saunders
2003, 2006; Muller 2015). Weak discernibility can be explained by
saying that two objects are weakly discernible if and only if there is
a relation R that they bear to each other but at least one them does
not bear to itself. What
 <a href="#PIIQw">(PIIQw)</a>
 demands is that every two objects be at least weakly discernible.</p>

<p>
Now, every two objects are weakly discernible, and this is trivially
so, since numerical difference is a symmetric but irreflexive
relation, which means that any objects \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy
 <a href="#PIIQw">(PIIQw)</a>
 trivially, since every two objects trivially satisfy the open
sentence &ldquo;\(x\) is numerically different from \(y\)&rdquo;, but,
equally trivially, no object satisfies it with respect to itself.
Obviously, the intended interpretation of (PIIQw) is that,
necessarily, every two objects are <em>non-trivially</em> weakly
discernible. But, given that no objects can differ relationally
without differing with respect to their relational properties, this is
equivalent to demanding that, necessarily, no two objects share all
their non-trivializing properties. And since no objects can differ
relationally without differing with respect to their relational
properties, any objects satisfying the Quinean versions of the
Identity of Indiscernibles because they differ in their relations will
also satisfy
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 or
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 because of differing in the corresponding relational properties. Thus
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>,
 (PIIa) and (PII) are no less adequate than the Quinean versions of
the Identity of Indiscernibles. From now on the discussion will
concentrate on (PIIb), (PIIa) and (PII).</p>

<p>
Another element that is open to variation in the Identity of
Indiscernibles is the domain of entities it is about. The Identity of
Indiscernibles has been formulated as a thesis about objects where an
object is understood as anything that can be the value of a first
order variable. Objects thus understood include both concrete and
abstract objects, and it is possible to restrict the thesis to either
concrete or abstract objects (for the distinction between concrete and
abstract objects see Falguera et al. 2021 [2022]). It is, indeed,
possible to restrict the thesis to any class of objects&mdash;though
it is likely that the more restricted the thesis, the less interesting
it is, especially if it is restricted to a class of arbitrarily
specified objects. And it is also possible to make the domain more
inclusive and allow in it the values of higher order variables, though
this is not discussed in what follows.</p>

<p>
Although it has traditionally been thought that concrete objects fail
to satisfy some version of the Identity of Indiscernibles, presumably
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>,
 while abstract objects satisfy it (see, e.g., Baldwin 1996: 233), in
recent years there has been considerable debate about whether there
are any abstract objects that violate the corresponding version of the
Identity of Indiscernibles. The debate has focused mainly on whether
there are numbers and graphs that satisfy some version of the Identity
of Indiscernibles (e.g., Ker&auml;nen 2001; MacBride 2006; Leitgeb
&amp; Ladyman 2008; de Clercq 2012; Duguid 2016; Assadian 2024).
Numbers and graphs are mathematical objects, and the discussion has
taken place mainly in the context of realist mathematical
structuralism. But similar debates could be had about whether
propositions, concepts, meanings, or any other abstract objects
satisfy some version of the Identity of Indiscernibles.</p>

<p>
Universals, as usually conceived, are the referents of singular terms
(i.e., &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;, &ldquo;redness&rdquo;, etc.) and
therefore they are values of first-order variables. Consequently, they
are objects as the term is understood here. Is the Identity of
Indiscernibles true of them? It has traditionally been thought that
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 is true of universals (see, e.g., Armstrong 1997: 50, Heil 2003: 159;
cf. Lewis 1986a [1999: 98]). Indeed, some have thought that what
distinguishes universals from particulars is that the former can be
indiscernible, while the latter cannot (e.g., Ehring 2011: 35,
Williams 1986: 3, Wisdom 1934: 208). But recently this line of thought
has been questioned, and it has been argued that there is nothing in
the concept of a universal that rules out indiscernible universals,
and that postulating indiscernible universals can be theoretically
useful (Giberman 2016, Rodriguez-Pereyra 2017b; for further discussion
see Ou 2024).</p>

<p>
The final element in the Identity of Indiscernibles that is open to
variation or interpretation is the modal operator. The Identity of
Indiscernibles is normally understood as metaphysically necessary. But
the modal operator in it could be taken to express other kinds of
necessity, e.g., logical necessity or physical necessity. Besides, the
Identity of Indiscernibles need not contain any modal operator at all,
in which case
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 states that it is the case that no two objects (of the relevant kind)
share all their non-trivializing properties, and
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 and
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 make the corresponding <em>de facto</em> statements. Of course, the
Identity of Indiscernibles can also be understood to make a modal
claim without making a necessity claim; for instance, it could be
understood to say that <em>contingently</em> no two objects (of the
relevant kind) share all their properties (of the relevant kind).
Indeed, some philosophers have argued that the Identity of
Indiscernibles is only contingently true (Casullo 1984; see French
1989 for discussion) and others have argued that in his letter to
Clarke Leibniz was trying to establish only the truth of the Identity
of Indiscernibles, without making any commitments as to whether it is
necessarily or only contingently true (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2014; the
modal status of the Identity of Indiscernibles in Leibniz&rsquo;s
philosophy is a traditional topic of Leibnizian scholarship&mdash;for
further recent discussion see Jauernig 2008; Jorati 2017; Bender 2019;
Lin 2025; Ruiz-G&oacute;mez 2017).</p>

<h2 id="ArgAgaIdeInd">3. Arguments against the Identity of Indiscernibles</h2>

<p>

 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 makes a very strong claim and it is plausible that there are actual
counterexamples. For instance, there might be two tree leaves or two
drops of water that share all their intrinsic pure properties
(these cases were considered by Leibniz [Leibniz &amp;
Clarke <em>Letters,</em> fourth letter to Clarke, p. 36] and
the second case was proposed by Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason;
see Kant 1781/87: A 264/B 320; for Kant on the Identity of
Indiscernibles in the pre-critical period, especially the <em>Nova
Dilucidatio</em>, see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2018). Nevertheless, there is
no guarantee that any two tree leaves or water drops share exactly the
same intrinsic pure properties, since for all one knows one of the
leaves or drops might have one more atom than the other, or there
might be another imperceptible difference between them. Indeed, this
is Leibniz&rsquo;s point against this alleged counterexample.</p>

<p>
It might be thought that mass produced objects are more likely to
constitute a counterexample to
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 than natural objects. Two Pepsi cans, say, at least immediately after
being made, are likely to have exactly the same intrinsic pure
properties. But even in this case there is no guarantee that they
do&mdash;for all one knows, one of the cans might have one more atom
than the other, or there might be another imperceptible difference
between them.</p>

<p>
The case of physical particles is different, and indeed some
philosophers have argued that there are indiscernible physical
particles (Cortes 1976, French 1989, Erdrich 2020). Admittedly, the
attribution of properties to particles is justified in terms of
explanatory fecundity, and it would be unjustified to attribute to
particles properties other than those that are explanatorily
necessary. There are two aspects of this argument that make it less
cogent than it might seem at first. The first is that from the fact
that one is not justified in attributing different properties to
particles it does not follow that one is justified in denying of them
any other properties. The second, related to the first, is that this
argument is contingent on the science of the day, and therefore it is
not absolutely conclusive, since science changes continuously, and it
might be that the science of tomorrow will assert that any two
physical particles have different properties.</p>

<p>
Another argument against
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 is based on the so-called <em>Recombination Principle</em>, according
to which putting together duplicates of parts of different possible
worlds yields another possible world (Lewis 1986b: 87&ndash;8; see
also van Cleve 2002: 391). If so, if there is a possible world with an
object having certain intrinsic pure properties, and there is another
possible world with an object having those intrinsic pure properties,
then there is a third possible world containing a duplicate of the
first object and a duplicate of the second object; this third world
contains objects sharing all their intrinsic pure properties and,
assuming that there is a possible world with objects sharing all their
intrinsic pure properties if and only if it is possible that there are
objects sharing all their intrinsic pure properties, this argument, if
sound and valid, proves (PIIb) false. As formulated, this argument
obviously presupposes the controversial Lewisian ontology of possible
worlds, and it is thereby weakened in its persuasive power. This is
not, however, an essential presupposition, and the argument could be
reformulated using only combinatorial principles without assuming the
Lewisian ontology of possible worlds. Nevertheless, it has been argued
that the argument cannot be reformulated in an actualist setting and
that it is actually invalid, since given that the objects in the first
two worlds are duplicates of each other, any duplicate of either is a
duplicate of the other, and so there is no guarantee that in the third
world there are two objects rather than one object at a distance from
itself (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2022: 81&ndash;82).</p>

<p>
Another argument against
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 is based on the idea that all intrinsic pure properties are not only
individually shareable but also jointly shareable. Thus, for any set
of intrinsic pure properties that an object could have, there could be
two objects having the same set of intrinsic pure properties
(Rodriguez-Pereyra 2022: 82&ndash;86). If this is the case, then
(PIIb) is false.</p>

<p>
There is a simpler argument against
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>,
 and this is that since we can imaginatively conceive two objects
having the same intrinsic pure properties, it is possible that there
are objects sharing all their intrinsic pure properties&mdash;hence
(PIIb) is false. Max Black&rsquo;s scenario consisting only of two
iron spheres, at a certain distance from each other, that have all
their pure properties in common (let us call such scenario
<em>Black&rsquo;s world</em>) can be seen as the conclusion of an
instance of this argument. Since Black&rsquo;s spheres are the only
two objects in the world or situation in question, they share all
their pure properties, both intrinsic and extrinsic; therefore,
Black&rsquo;s spheres constitute a counterexample to both
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 and (PIIb). This is the most influential argument against the
Identity of Indiscernibles in the history of philosophy.</p>

<p>
One assumption of this argument is that the relevant kind of
conceivability entails the relevant kind of possibility. But resisting
this assumption is not the only way to resist this kind of argument
against
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 and
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>.
 One might also resist it by arguing that the content of our
imaginative act leaves open whether what we imagine is two spheres at
a distance from each other or merely one sphere at a distance from
itself (Hacking 1975: 251; O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne 1995: 195), and
thus it is not legitimate to conclude that Black&rsquo;s world is
possible. But there are reasons to be sceptical of this kind of reply
since it might be the case, as Calosi and Varzi have argued, that this
kind of reply adds nothing to the simple denial that there can be
indiscernible objects (Calosi &amp; Varzi 2016). Another reply to the
argument, similar in vein in that it also exploits the fact that the
content of our imaginative act does not guarantee that we are
imagining two spheres at a distance from each other, is that all we
might be imagining in such a case is a simple and scattered object
occupying two spherical regions (cf. Hawley 2009). This object is not
a sphere, nor does it contain any spheres as parts. A fourth response
to the argument argues that the spheres are fusions of pure properties
and that they share, among their qualitative parts, an unlocated
sphere that consists of all the spheres&rsquo; pure properties except
their location properties. Thus, on this line of thought,
Black&rsquo;s world does not contain two spheres that share all their
pure properties but one unlocated sphere and two located ones, and the
two located ones differ with respect to their location properties
(Shiver 2014: 909&ndash;10). Sometimes it is argued that the spheres
in Black&rsquo;s world do not counterexemplify the Identity of
Indiscernibles because they are weakly discernible, since although
they are at a distance from each other, neither is at a distance from
itself; thus, for instance, sphere \(a\) is two miles away from sphere
\(b\) but it is not two miles away from itself (Saunders 2006, Muller
2015). But although this point is correct, it does not touch the claim
that Black&rsquo;s spheres constitute a counterexample to
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>,
 which is what Black&rsquo;s example was intended to
counterexemplify.</p>

<p>
Bob Adams (1979) has provided a different argument against
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 (and therefore against
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 too). This argument infers the possibility of indiscernible objects
from the possibility of almost indiscernible objects&mdash;that is, it
infers the possibility of objects sharing all their pure properties
from the possibility of objects sharing almost all their pure
properties. Thus, the argument can be put in this form (the reference
to <em>possible worlds</em> is not essential, and the argument can be
formulated using modal operators instead):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li id="premise1">There is a possible world with objects that share
almost all their pure properties.</li>

<li id="premise2">If there is a possible world with objects that share
almost all their pure properties, there is a possible world with
objects that share all their pure properties.</li>

<li id="conclusion">Therefore, there is a possible world with objects
that share all their pure properties.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, if
 <a href="#premise1">premise 1</a>
 is true, there is a possible world \(w_1\) where there are only two
iron spheres, at a certain distance from each other, and sharing all
their pure properties, with only one exception: whilst one sphere has
temperature \(T\), the other one has a slightly different temperature,
\(T^*\), e.g., the second sphere is one degree hotter than the first.
And if
 <a href="#premise2">premise 2</a>
 is true, then if there is a world with objects sharing almost all
their pure properties, there is a world with objects that share all
their pure properties, e.g., a world \(w_2\) where the spheres of
\(w_1\) are exactly as they are in \(w_1\) except that in \(w_2\) they
both have the same temperature, say \(T\). The two premises entail the
conclusion. And assuming that there is a possible world with objects
that share all their pure properties if and only if it is possible
that there are objects that share all their pure properties, the
conclusion of the argument is equivalent to the claim that
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 is false. It has been argued that either the second premise lacks
adequate support, or almost indiscernible objects are dispensable to
establish the conclusion of the argument. If the premise lacks
support, the argument does not establish the possibility of
indiscernible objects; if almost indiscernible objects are
dispensable, the argument is not needed to establish the possibility
of indiscernible objects (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2017a).</p>

<p>
Finally, a subtraction argument has been advanced against
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2022: 87&ndash;100). This argument presupposes the
falsity of
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 and it is based on the basic idea that if there is a possible world
with objects sharing all their intrinsic pure properties that are
spatiotemporally and causally symmetrically and independently related
to each other, then there is a possible world where everything else
has been &ldquo;subtracted&rdquo; and those objects are the only
objects, and in such a world those objects share all their pure
properties, intrinsic and extrinsic. Assuming that there is a possible
world with objects that share all their pure properties if and only if
it is possible that there are objects that share all their pure
properties, the conclusion of the argument is equivalent to the claim
that (PIIa) is false. (Again, the reference to possible worlds is not
essential and the argument can be formulated using modal operators
instead.)</p>

<h2 id="ArgForIdeInd">4. Arguments for the Identity of Indiscernibles</h2>

<p>
Faithful to his style, Leibniz produced a battery of different
arguments for the Identity of Indiscernibles. As was pointed out
before, Leibniz&rsquo;s intended version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles is a principle stronger than
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>,
 one that entails (PIIb). Here we shall briefly concentrate only on
two of Leibniz&rsquo;s arguments. The first argument, typical from his
philosophy in the 1680s and whose <em lang="la">locus classicus</em>
is Section 9 of the <em>Discourse on Metaphysics</em>, tries to derive
the Identity of Indiscernibles from Leibniz&rsquo;s idea that
individual substances have complete individual concepts, concepts that
contain absolutely everything that is true of them, past, present, and
future (Leibniz 1686 [2020]). The argument, however, is subject to two
related objections. Firstly, nowhere does Leibniz argue that
numerically different individual substances cannot share an individual
complete concept, that is, there is no argument from Leibniz that,
necessarily, no two individual substances have one and the same
individual complete concept. But if they did, given that such concepts
contain all the intrinsic pure properties of the substances having
those concepts, there would be indiscernible substances in the sense
ruled out by (PIIb), i.e., substances sharing all their intrinsic pure
properties. Secondly, even if, necessarily, no two substances share
their individual complete concepts, Leibniz has not ruled out the
possibility of indiscernible individual complete concepts&mdash;that
is, Leibniz has not ruled out the possibility of numerically distinct
individual complete concepts that specify the same intrinsic pure
properties. But if such indiscernible concepts are possible, then two
or more individual substances could falsify (PIIb) by virtue of having
indiscernible individual complete concepts.</p>

<p>
The other Leibnizian argument for the Identity of Indiscernibles to be
mentioned here appears in Leibniz&rsquo;s Correspondence with Samuel
Clarke (Leibniz &amp; Clarke <em>Letters,</em> fifth letter to Clarke,
page 61). According to this argument, if there were objects sharing
all their intrinsic pure properties, God would have had no reason to
place them where he did rather than swap them around, since the world
would not have been less valuable if the objects had been swapped
around and no other change had been made; but since God does not act
without a reason, God did not create objects sharing all their
intrinsic pure properties, that is,
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 is true. Of course, this argument depends on the assumption that a
certain kind of god exists, namely one for whom the only reason to
create one world rather than another is that the world to be created
instantiates more value than the other. Needless to say, the
assumption that such a god, or any god for that matter, exists, is
extremely controversial and rests on weak rational grounds.
Furthermore, the argument also presupposes that any two objects could
have been swapped around, leaving everything else intact. But this
presupposition fails in the case of two atomic objects that are the
only objects in a world whose space is relational (see
Rodriguez-Pereyra 2014: 108&ndash;112).</p>

<p>
One might try to reformulate Leibniz&rsquo;s argument without the
assumption that God exists and that any two objects could have been
swapped around. For instance, one might try the following argument,
which has undoubtedly Leibnizian credentials: A sufficiently strong
version of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, one according to which
the intrinsic pure properties of every object determine its location,
is true; if there were any objects sharing all their intrinsic pure
properties, their intrinsic pure properties would not have determined
their location (assuming, as Leibniz did in the original argument,
that no two objects are co-located); therefore no two objects share
all their intrinsic pure properties, that is,
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 is true. But this argument, like the previous one, is dubious, since
the plausibility of the relevant version of the Principle of
Sufficient Reason is inversely proportional to its strength.</p>

<p>
Bernard Bolzano, sometimes known as the &ldquo;Bohemian
Leibniz&rdquo;, rejected some Leibnizian principles, and accepted
others, and one of those he accepted was the Identity of
Indiscernibles. He argues for
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 and his argument for it is different from any argument for the
Identity of Indiscernibles one finds in Leibniz. Bolzano believes that
all finite substances are causally connected. On this basis he infers
the Identity of Indiscernibles, since he thinks that for two
substances to have the same intrinsic pure properties they must not
only have been given the same original properties by God, but they
must also be surrounded by substances that have exactly the same
causal effects on them. But Bolzano thinks that there are infinitely
more possible situations in which any two substances are surrounded by
substances causally affecting them differently than situations in
which they are surrounded by substances causally affecting them
equally. Since he takes all these possible situations to be
equiprobable, Bolzano infers that (PIIb) is true (Bolzano 1837:
532&ndash;33 [2014: volume 1, pp. 384&ndash;85]). There are a few
problems with this argument, one of which is that the fact that
something is improbable, however highly improbable it is, does not
entail that it is not true, and another one is that it is not clear
that there are infinitely more possible situations in which any two
substances are surrounded by substances causally affecting them
differently than situations in which they are surrounded by substances
causally affecting them equally. Thus, the argument seems to fall
short of establishing its intended conclusion.</p>

<p>
A. J. Ayer (1953) argued for
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 on the basis that there are reasons to believe in the Bundle Theory
and that such a theory entails (PIIa) or something like it. This
argument makes the Identity of Indiscernibles even more controversial
than the Bundle Theory itself, for it assumes not only the truth of
the Bundle Theory, but also that this theory entails the Identity of
Indiscernibles, and both assumptions are controversial and therefore
they need argumentative support (for more on the Identity of
Indiscernibles and the Bundle Theory see the next section).</p>

<p>
Michael Della Rocca (2005) has argued, in rationalist spirit, for
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>.
 His argument can be concisely represented as follows: a denial of
(PIIa) commits one to a violation of a version of the Principle of
Sufficient Reason, since if (PIIa) were not true, the non-identity of
indiscernible objects sharing all their pure properties would be
primitive and therefore such non-identity would have no explanation.
Of course, this requires a commitment to a sufficiently strong version
of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and not everyone would be
willing to follow Della Rocca in this (as he himself points out). It
might be thought that what the argument supports is
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 rather than (PIIa), since presumably the non-identity of objects
sharing all their pure properties but differing with respect to some
non-trivializing impure properties might be explained by their
difference with respect to those non-trivializing impure
properties&mdash;however, a difference only in non-trivializing impure
properties requires that identity be primitive, or at least not
explainable in terms of pure properties, and therefore the relevant
version of the Principle of Sufficient Reason operating in Della
Rocca&rsquo;s argument would still be violated. Thus, the argument, if
sound and valid, supports (PIIa), and thereby it also supports
(PII).</p>

<p>
Although perhaps he was not aware of it, McTaggart offered an argument
for
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>,
 since he was implicitly considering all non-trivializing properties
and his argument does not depend on there being any difference in pure
properties between substances. His argument requires making the
thought experiment of removing in thought all difference in nature
from two substances, and he says that when we do that we find that we
are contemplating not two substances, but only one. And this, he says,
comes from the &ldquo;recognition of the impossibility of diversity
without dissimilarity&rdquo;. Then he adds, in a passage with
Leibnizian reminiscences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The nature of a substance expresses completely what the substance is.
And the same complete expression of what a substance is cannot be true
of each of two substances. The substance is made this substance by its
nature, and, if the nature is the same, the substance is the same.
(McTaggart 1921: 96)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
True, if what makes a certain substance the substance it is is its
nature, then no other substance can have the same nature&mdash;but
claiming that what makes it the substance it is is its nature shows
that one has already assumed
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>.</p>
 
<p>
There are two other recent arguments for
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>.
 One assumes a relatively weak Humean principle to the effect that,
necessarily, no two objects necessarily co-vary with respect to every
non-trivializing property&mdash;that is, necessarily, for no two
objects \(x\) and \(y\) is it the case that, for every
non-trivializing property \(F\), necessarily, \(x\) is \(F\) if and
only if \(y\) is \(F\). It is plausible that this principle is true.
For any objects \(x\) and \(y\) necessarily co-varying with respect to
every non-trivializing property would be such that, necessarily, \(x\)
is square if and only if \(y\) is square, \(x\) is a left-wing
activist if and only if \(y\) is a left-wing activist, \(x\) is
exactly in place \(p\) at time \(t\) if and only if \(y\) is exactly
in place \(p\) at time \(t\), and so on for every non-trivializing
property. But such objects would exhibit a degree of mutual dependence
that seems to be incompatible with the degree of ontological autonomy
required to be a concrete object. Furthermore, objects violating (PII)
would necessarily co-vary with respect to every non-trivializing
property. For, necessarily, every object \(x\) has, for every
non-trivializing property F, the property of <em>necessarily,
having</em> \(F\) <em>if and only if</em> \(x\) <em>has</em> \(F\).
Thus, a particular object \(a\) has, for every non-trivializing
property \(F\), the property of <em>necessarily, having \(F\) if and
only if a has \(F\)</em>. But this latter property is, itself, a
non-trivializing (impure) property, since differing with respect to it
requires differing extra-numerically, since for any two objects to
differ with respect to it is for them to differ with respect to
whether having \(F\) is necessarily connected to \(a\)&rsquo;s having
\(F\), rather than differing merely with respect to which objects they
are. Since, for every property \(F\), the property of <em>necessarily,
having \(F\) if and only if a has \(F\)</em> is a non-trivializing
property, every object sharing all its trivializing properties with
\(a\) will share such properties with \(a\) and, thus, it would
necessarily co-vary with \(a\) with respect to every non-trivializing
property. Thus, generally, objects violating (PII) would necessarily
co-vary with respect to every non-trivializing property&mdash;hence,
given the Humean principle that, necessarily, no two objects
necessarily co-vary with respect to every non-trivializing property,
(PII) is true.</p>

<p>
The other argument assumes an idea about grounding, namely that for
every concrete object \(x\) that exists at a particular time \(t\),
\(x\) exists in time because \(x\) exists at \(t\), and for no object
\(y\) other than \(x\) is it the case that \(x\) exists in time
because \(y\) exists at \(t\). Now, a property like <em>existing in
time because \(a\) exists at time \(t\)</em> is a non-trivializing
(impure) property, since for objects to differ with respect to it they
must differ extra-numerically, that is, they must differ with respect
to which object&rsquo;s existence at a particular time grounds their
existence in time, rather than differing merely with respect to which
objects they are. So, given any two concrete objects \(a\) and \(b\)
that exist at time \(t\), they must differ with respect to some of
their non-trivializing properties, since they must differ with respect
to the properties of <em>existing in time because \(a\) exists at time
t</em> (only \(a\) will have it), and <em>existing in time because
\(b\) exists at time t</em> (only \(b\) will have it). Thus, the
argument goes,
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 is true of concrete objects. But the argument can be extended to
abstract objects too, since properties like <em>being abstract or
concrete because \(b\) is abstract</em> are non-trivializing (impure)
properties that cannot be shared, and therefore any two two objects,
whether abstract or concrete, must differ in some non-trivializing
properties, which is what (PII) demands (For this argment and the
previous one see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2022: 106&ndash;125).</p>

<h2 id="ConIdeInd">5. Connections of the Identity of Indiscernibles</h2>

<p>
The Identity of Indiscernibles interacts, or is thought to interact,
in interesting ways with other philosophical theses. One such
interaction is by way of the metaphysical consequences of the Identity
of Indiscernibles. The stronger the version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles, the more metaphysical consequences it has. Thus, some
of the substantive metaphysical consequences of
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 are not consequences of the weaker versions of the Identity of
Indiscernibles. (PIIb) entails, for instance, that space, time, and
spacetime are not absolute, that is, that there are no points or
regions of space, time, or spacetime, since they would share all their
intrinsic pure properties. Similarly, (PIIb) entails that there are no
atoms or physically elementary particles, since these are often
conceived as sharing their intrinsic pure properties. Leibniz was
aware of these consequences of the stronger versions of the Identity
of Indiscernibles, and he also thought that the Identity of
Indiscernibles entailed that the mind was not a <em lang="la">tabula
rasa</em> (since such minds would share all their intrinsic pure
properties) and that, consequently, it entailed the existence of
innate ideas.</p>

<p>
Can a principle of individuation in terms of pure properties be
extracted from
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 or
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>?
 That is, a principle of individuation of objects, according to which
what makes a particular object the particular object it is, is that it
has the pure properties, or the intrinsic pure properties, it has. No,
such a principle of individuation cannot be extracted from them. This
is because although (PIIa) and (PIIb) rule out the possibility of
objects sharing all their pure properties, neither principle entails
that any set of pure properties is necessary and sufficient for being
a particular object. That is, both principles forbid the possibility
of two or more objects sharing all their pure properties, but neither
principle forbids objects that could have had the same pure properties
that any actual object has. This is perhaps better seen in terms of
possible worlds: although both principles rule out possible worlds in
which two or more objects share all their pure properties, neither
principle rules out two or more objects having the same pure
properties in different possible worlds.</p>

<p>
One thesis which is often thought to interact with the Identity of
Indiscernibles is Anti-Haecceitism. As is well known, there are many
different senses of Haecceitism and Anti-Haecceitism, and we shall
here briefly discuss the relations between various of these senses and
the Identity of Indiscernibles (see Cowling 2015b [2023] for a
discussion of Haecceitism and Anti-Haecceitism).</p>

<p>
The Identity of Indiscernibles is a supervenience thesis, namely the
thesis that numerical identity supervenes upon indiscernibility. And
the different versions of the Identity of Indiscernibles,
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>,
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>, and
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>,
 make numerical identity supervene on different kinds of
indiscernibility: indiscernibility with respect to intrinsic pure
properties (PIIb), indiscernibility with respect to pure properties,
whether intrinsic or extrinsic (PPIIa), and indiscernibility with
respect to non-trivializing properties, whether pure or impure (PII).
Since pure properties are purely qualitative properties, (PIIa) and
(PIIb) make numerical identity supervene upon the purely qualitative.
That is, according to these two principles, once you fix the purely
qualitative properties of objects, you thereby fix the facts about
their numerical identity and difference. That is, once the purely
qualitative properties of objects are fixed, the facts about how many
objects there are in the world are fixed (assuming objects having
different qualitative properties are numerically different, an
uncontroversial assumption). Since fixing all the purely qualitative
facts of the world includes fixing the purely qualitative properties
of the objects, if (PIIa) or (PIIb) are true, fixing all the purely
qualitative facts of the world fixes the facts about how many objects
there are in the world.</p>

<p>
In one sense of the term, Anti-Haecceitism is the view that fixing all
purely qualitative facts fixes <em>all</em> facts. That is,
necessarily, any purely qualitative description of reality entails all
facts. This version of Anti-Haecceitism rules out the possibility of
merely non-qualitative differences; for instance, it rules out the
possibility that I could have had all the pure properties of Napoleon
Bonaparte, or that someone who does not actually exist could have had
all the pure properties of Indira Ghandi (Skow 2008 and Scarpati 2023
argue that Anti-Haecceitism should be understood along these lines).
This version of Anti-Haecceitism entails neither
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 nor
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>,
 since nothing in it requires that a purely qualitative description of
reality entails that there are no objects having the same pure
properties, or even the same intrinsic pure properties&mdash;indeed,
that there are two objects sharing all their pure properties is a
purely qualitative description, and therefore it might be part of a
purely qualitative description of reality. And nor does such a version
of Anti-Haecceitism entail
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 either, since the fact that, necessarily, any purely qualitative
description of reality entails all facts does not entail that no two
objects can share all their non-trivializing properties, pure and
impure. However, Alexander Roberts has argued that Anti-Haecceitism
entails (PIIa) on the basis of some recombination
assumptions&mdash;for instance, that it is metaphysically possible for
any concrete object to be either the tallest, the smallest, the most
massive, or the least massive of its kind, or that for any intrinsic
pure property that neither of two objects has, it is possible that at
least one of those objects has it while the other one does not have
it. In effect, what Roberts argues is that, necessarily, there are no
objects that, necessarily, share all their pure properties. Some of
these assumptions will not be accepted by everyone, and indeed Roberts
himself has noted that some of them do not hold up in certain
ontologies (Roberts 2024: 95, fn. 4), so there is some degree of
conditionality to Roberts&rsquo; conclusion.</p>

<p>
Do any versions of the Identity of Indiscernibles here discussed
entail Anti-Haecceitism? No.
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>,
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>, and
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 all require that it is impossible that numerically distinct objects
share all their properties of a certain kind. But no matter which
kinds of properties objects cannot share, that does not rule out the
possibility of any object other than Napoleon having had all his pure
properties. Indeed, while (PIIa), (PIIb), and (PII) are theses that
rule out possibilities which include distinct objects sharing all
their properties of a certain kind, Anti-Haecceitism rules out
<em>distinct</em> possibilities in which distinct objects share all
their pure properties. Another way of putting this point is that while
(PIIa), (PIIb), and (PII) are &ldquo;intra-world&rdquo; theses,
Anti-Haecceitism is a &ldquo;cross-worlds&rdquo; thesis.</p>

<p>
And, indeed, often Anti-Haecceitism is presented as a thesis about
possible worlds. In this sense Anti-Haecceitism is the thesis that no
distinct possible worlds are purely qualitatively indiscernible
(though see Skow 2008 for an argument that Haecceitism and
Anti-Haecceitism should not be defined in terms of possible worlds).
In so far as
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 and
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 quantify over all objects of all kinds, they entail Anti-Haecceitism
understood in terms of possible worlds, for those two principles
entail that any two possible worlds differ in some of their pure
properties.
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>,
 on the other hand, does not entail this version of Anti-Haecceitism,
since (PII) does not require objects (possible worlds included) to
differ purely qualitatively. Anti-Haecceitism understood in this way
does not entail any of the three versions of the Identity of
Indiscernibles here distinguished, since Anti-Haecceitism thus
understood is a thesis that rules out the qualitative indiscernibility
of certain objects, namely possible worlds, while (PIIa) and (PIIb)
rule out the qualitative indiscernibility of all types of objects, and
(PII) rules out a different kind of indiscernibility of all types of
objects.</p>

<p>
In a less common sense, Anti-Haecceitism is the thesis that,
necessarily, there are no haecceities, where haecceities are what we
have called properties of identity, i.e., properties like
<em>being identical with Napoleon</em>. All three principles
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>,
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>, and
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>, are
 compatible with the existence of haecceities, and therefore they do
not entail Anti-Haecceitism in this sense. Nor does Anti-Haecceitism
thus understood entail any of those three principles, since the
non-existence of haecceities is compatible with difference <em lang="la">solo
numero</em>: to differ <em lang="la">solo numero</em>
two objects must differ with respect to which objects they are without
differing with respect to how they are, intrinsically or
extrinsically. But to differ with respect to which objects they are,
objects need not have any haecceities: Castor and Pollux, let us
suppose, may differ only in that one of them is Castor and the other
is Pollux without thereby having to have the properties of <em>being
identical with Castor</em> and <em>being identical with
Pollux</em>.</p>

<p>
In yet another sense Anti-Haecceitism is the thesis that the identity
of objects is reducible to their pure properties. One minimal
condition of the identity of objects&rsquo; being reducible to their
pure properties is that, for every possible object, having certain
pure properties is a necessarily sufficient condition for being that
particular object. But neither
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 nor
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 entail that having any pure properties are necessarily sufficient for
being any particular object. All they entail is that, necessarily, no
objects can share all their intrinsic pure properties (PIIb) or all
their pure properties (PIIa). But this does not mean that having any
pure properties is necessarily sufficient for being a certain object
in particular, i.e., that there are pure properties such that only one
object could have had them. Thus, neither (PIIa) nor (PIIb) entail
Anti-Haecceitism in this sense (and it should be even clearer that
 <a href="#PII">(PII)</a>
 does not entail it either). On the other hand, Anti-Haecceitism in
the present sense entails (PIIa) (and therefore it also entails
(PII)), since if, for every possible object, having certain pure
properties is a necessarily sufficient condition for being that
particular object, then, necessarily, no two objects can share all
their pure properties. Similarly, a version of Anti-Haecceitism such
that, for every possible object, having certain <em>intrinsic</em>
pure properties is a necessarily sufficient condition for being that
particular object, entails (PIIb) (and therefore it also entails
(PIIa) and (PII)).</p>

<p>
Another interesting interaction is that between the Identity of
Indiscernibles and the Bundle Theory. It is often thought that the
Bundle Theory entails a version of the Identity of Indiscernibles,
namely
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 and/or
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 (Armstrong 1978: 91; Loux 1998: 107). There are different versions of
the Bundle Theory, but one version of it says that properties are
universals, and individual objects are entirely constituted by the
universals they instantiate (thus individuals are
&ldquo;bundles&rdquo; of universals, hence the theory&rsquo;s name).
Given this, the thought is, there cannot be two objects instantiating
exactly the same universals, since objects that instantiated exactly
the same universals would be entirely constituted by the same entities
(namely the same universals), and no two objects, it is assumed, could
have exactly the same constituents. Since universals are supposed to
be pure properties, the idea is that the Bundle Theory entails either
(PIIa) or (PIIb).</p>

<p>
There are several possible reactions to this. One is to accept the
entailment and, on the premise that the relevant versions of the
Identity of Indiscernibles
 (<a href="#PIIa">PIIa</a>
 and
 <a href="#PIIb">PIIb</a>)
 are false, reject the Bundle Theory (Armstrong 1978: 91). Another one
is, of course, to accept the relevant versions of the Identity of
Indiscernibles on the premise that the Bundle Theory is true (Ayer
1953; see
 <a href="#ArgForIdeInd">section 4</a>
 above). A third option is to defend the Bundle Theory from the
falsity of the Identity of Indiscernibles by holding that the relevant
versions of it have not been proved to be false
(O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne 1995). Yet another option is to reject the
assumption that no two objects can have exactly the same constituents,
and thereby reject the entailment from the Bundle Theory to the
Identity of Indiscernibles, which allows one to simultaneously uphold
the Bundle Theory and reject the relevant version of the Identity of
Indiscernibles, i.e., (PIIa) and/or (PIIb) (Rodriguez-Pereyra
2004).</p>

<p>
There is a further option: to reject the assumption that properties
are universals and take them to be tropes, and take substances or
objects to be entirely constituted by their tropes (for such theories
see Kein&auml;nen &amp; Hakkarainen 2024). Tropes have the peculiarity
that, while they cannot be shared by objects, they can resemble each
other exactly. This option requires accepting the entailment from the
Bundle Theory (interpreted as a Trope Bundle Theory) to the Identity
of Indiscernibles, and yet it does not jeopardize the Bundle Theory
since on this view the relevant versions of the Identity of
Indiscernibles are true, given that tropes cannot be shared by any
objects. However, it might be argued that only the letter, but not the
spirit, of the Identity of Indiscernibles is preserved under this
strategy. For although no two objects can share tropes, since tropes
can resemble each other exactly, two objects can resemble each other
exactly if they have exactly resembling tropes. And it is plausible
that the point of
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>
 and
 <a href="#PIIb">(PIIb)</a>
 is to rule out perfect resemblance between objects.</p>

<p>
The Identity of Indiscernibles claims a connection between numerical
identity and indiscernibility, namely that there cannot be
indiscernibility without numerical identity (from now on the qualifier
&lsquo;numerical&rsquo; will be omitted). Given the centrality of
grounding in the contemporary metaphysical discussion, many
philosophers have inquired after the grounds of identity, and the
Identity of Indiscernibles might be thought to offer an obvious
candidate, namely indiscernibility&mdash;that is, what grounds the
fact that \(a = b\) is that \(a\) and \(b\) are indiscernible. But
although the connection between identity and indiscernibility
established by the Identity of Indiscernibles might suggest that
indiscernibility grounds identity, the Identity of Indiscernibles is
not a principle about grounding. That is, the Identity of
Indiscernibles, in its various forms, does not claim that
indiscernibility grounds identity&mdash;instead, it asserts a
supervenience relation between identity and indiscernibility, or
between identity and a given kind of indiscernibility, namely that \(a
= b\) supervenes upon (the right kind of) indiscernibility. But that
it is not a principle about ground does not mean that the Identity of
Indiscernibles is not an interesting principle&mdash;the question
whether indiscernibility (of whatever kind) can obtain without
identity is an interesting question in itself.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, though the truth of the Identity of Indiscernibles is a
question independent from any questions about ground, the question
whether indiscernibility grounds identity is also an interesting one.
The idea that indiscernibility grounds identity has been thought to be
problematic&mdash;in particular, it has been thought to be circular,
on the grounds that the indiscernibility between \(a\) and \(b\) is
the fact that every property F is such that \(a\) has it if and only
\(b\) has it, and the fact that \(a\) has property F (for any \(F\)
\(a\) has) is one of the grounds of this biconditional fact. But given
\(a = a\), one of the properties \(a\) has is the property of
<em>being identical with a</em>, and so (<em>assuming the transitivity
of grounding</em>), \(a\)&rsquo;s having the property of <em>being
identical with a</em> partially grounds the fact that \(a = a\). But
the fact that \(a\) has the property of <em>being identical with
a</em> is the fact that \(a = a\); thus, the fact that \(a = a\)
partially grounds itself, something many have found inadmissible
(Elgin forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Obviously, this puzzle does not affect those who think identity is
ungrounded, fundamental. But even those who accept that identity is
grounded have resources to avoid the puzzle. One obvious way out of
the puzzle is to reject the transitivity of grounding, which some have
found reason to reject (e.g., Schaffer 2012). But there are other
options. One of them is to restrict the properties whose sharing
grounds identity to purely qualitative ones. That, of course, assumes
the truth of
 <a href="#PIIa">(PIIa)</a>,
 which is very controversial, to say the least. Alternatively, one can
attempt to ground identity in necessary indiscernibility, as Thornton
proposes (Thornton forthcoming). According to this proposal, what
grounds that \(a = a\) is that \(a\) is necessarily indiscernible from
\(a\), and what grounds that \(a\) is numerically different from \(b\)
is that \(a\) and \(b\) are possibly discernible from each other. On
this proposal indiscernibility is restricted to purely qualitative
properties. The proposal presupposes that there cannot be numerically
distinct entities that are necessarily (purely qualitative)
indiscernible, and so its viability depends on whether such a
presupposition is true. Another option is to maintain that \(a = a\)
is grounded in the fact that \(a\) bears only purely qualitative
reflexive relations to \(a\). But this is vulnerable to the
possibility of co-located purely qualitatively indiscernible objects,
since some such objects will not stand in any purely qualitative
irreflexive relations with respect to each other (bosons might be an
example of such objects). Finally, Elgin has argued that what grounds
the fact that \(a = a\) is a relation that obtains between the
second-order universal quantifier and <em>being a property that a has
if and only if a has it</em>. This avoids the circularity problem
mentioned above, since a relation is not a fact and so the problem
that the identity fact partially grounds itself does not arise (Elgin
forthcoming). (Of course there are other accounts of the grounds of
identity, but here the focus is on a very brief description of some
accounts on which indiscernibility, or something very close to it,
grounds identity. For more general discussion of the grounds of
identity see Lo 2023, forthcoming and Shumener 2020).</p>
