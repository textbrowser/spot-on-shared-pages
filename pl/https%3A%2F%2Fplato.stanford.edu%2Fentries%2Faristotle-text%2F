<h1>The Textual Transmission of the Aristotelian Corpus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Mar 7, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The Aristotelian corpus (<em>corpus aristotelicum</em>) is the
collection of the extant works transmitted under the name of Aristotle
along with its organizational features, such as its ordering, internal
textual divisions (into books and chapters) and titles. It has evolved
over time: Aristotelian treatises have sometimes been lost and
sometimes recovered, &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; works now regarded as
inauthentic have joined the collection while scribes and scholars were
attempting to organize its massive amount of text in various ways. The
texts it includes are highly technical treatises that were not
originally intended for publication and first circulated within
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophical circle only, Aristotle distinguishes
them from his &ldquo;exoteric&rdquo; works (<em>Pol.</em>
1278<sup>b</sup>30; <em>EE</em> 1217<sup>b</sup>22,
1218<sup>b</sup>34) which were meant for a wider audience.</p>

<p>
The modern Aristotelian corpus is not identical with the total amount
of philosophical texts produced by Aristotle. One major difference
between the ancient and the modern corpus is that the ancient one
included Aristotle&rsquo;s dialogues, the most famous works that he
&ldquo;published&rdquo; (i.e. made available to the general public)
during his lifetime. The dialogues are now known only indirectly
through quotations in other authors, they were written in a much more
accessible style (praised by Cicero for its &ldquo;golden flow&rdquo;,
<em>Acad. Pr.</em> 38.119) compared to the extant treatises and do not
always reflect the same views. The discrepancy between the two sets of
texts was already noted in ancient times (as Lucian puts it in the
2<sup>nd</sup> century CE, with Aristotle one gets two doctrines for
the price of one: <em>Vitarum auctio</em> 26).</p>

<p>
Even for the works that are assumed to have really been composed by
Aristotle, there is a considerable distance between the witnesses to
the text which have been preserved and Aristotle&rsquo;s activity: the
earliest available manuscripts often go back to the 9<sup>th</sup>
century CE, at a time when the identity and structure of the
collection had become stable, whereas Aristotle was active during the
4<sup>th</sup> century BCE, more than a millennium before. The
Aristotelian corpus has only been preserved thanks to a reiterated and
painstaking process of (manual) copying over centuries. This long-term
transmission process must have had a tremendous impact on
Aristotle&rsquo;s text, but, as the original copies have been lost for
more than two millennia, deviations induced by the transmission may
often only be spotted indirectly, by means of careful comparisons
between the various testimonies to the text that are still
available.</p>

<p>
There are often good reasons to suspect that some parts or features of
Aristotle&rsquo;s text are later artifacts. This is famously the case
with the chapter-division that is now found in every Aristotelian
treatise, which can at times run counter to the flow of
Aristotle&rsquo;s thought: the division goes back to Renaissance
editions and has no manuscript basis. More generally,
Aristotle&rsquo;s text itself is far from stable across its different
manuscript witnesses. With the production of each new copy the text
has been exposed to all sorts of accidents and manipulations that
editors now try to detect by comparing the different versions that
have been preserved and investigating the ancient and medieval
receptions of Aristotle&rsquo;s works.</p>

<p>
A scientific edition of a work of Aristotle is an attempt to
reconstruct the ancient state of the text (which sometimes falls short
of the original) on the basis of the extant data, provided under the
main printed text in a critical apparatus. Modern readers of Aristotle
should therefore be aware that what they read when they open a book
purporting to contain a philosophical work authored by Aristotle,
either in the original Greek or in a translation, is the product of a
long and complicated transmission process. Some striking features of
the Aristotelian corpus, such as the presence of
&ldquo;doublets&rdquo; (identical passages occurring more than once in
different books) or the existence of alternative versions, make this
history obvious. There is no absolute guarantee that any part of
Aristotle&rsquo;s text as it is currently reconstructed corresponds
exactly to what Aristotle would have wanted to express in the context
where he would have wanted it to be expressed. That being said, when
it comes to suspicions of inauthenticity or textual manipulation, the
burden of the proof rests on the prosecution. In spite of many local
controversies, there is a high level of scholarly consensus regarding
the authenticity of the works which today make up our Aristotelian
corpus.</p>

<h2 id="OveModAriCor">1. Overview of the modern Aristotelian corpus</h2>

<p>
The modern Aristotelian corpus is defined by Bekker&rsquo;s seminal
1831 edition, on which the standard reference system for
Aristotle&rsquo;s text is based (in scholarly citation, e.g.
&ldquo;Aristotle, <em>Cat.</em> 2<sup>a</sup>3&rdquo; refers to the
third line in the first column on the second page of Bekker&rsquo;s
edition; all scholarly modern editions and translations reference
these numbers). It corresponds to 45 treatises in the following order
(a Latin title is sometimes more commonly used in which case its
English translation is given inside square brackets; works presumed to
be inauthentic are preceded by an asterisk):</p>

<p>
The <em>Constitution of the Athenians</em>, after its discovery in two
papyri (<em>PBerol.</em> 5009 and <em>PLond.</em> 13, Pack 163 &amp;
164) towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, is the only text
to have joined the Aristotelian corpus since 1831. Fragments from
Aristotle&rsquo;s many lost works or spurious works preserved in
languages other than Greek (such as the <em>Liber de causis</em> or
<em>De pomo</em>) are excluded from the scope of this entry, even
though they played a major role in the medieval reception of
Aristotle.</p>

<p>
The modern Aristotelian corpus is but a subset of the ancient
Aristotelian corpus. It includes exclusively &ldquo;esoteric&rdquo;
works that were not published in Aristotle&rsquo;s lifetime and were
intended for a restricted circle, allowing for an exceptionally dense
and terse style that would not have been suited for a general
audience. They are connected to Aristotle&rsquo;s research and
teaching activity within the various philosophical communities to
which he belonged in the 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE (most prominently
the Lyceum, his school), where communication is assumed to have been
primarily oral (the Greek title of <em>Phys</em>. uses the word
<em>akroasis</em>, &ldquo;oral lecture&rdquo;). With the possible
exceptions of <em>HA</em> and the <em>Constitution of the
Athenians</em> which may be classified as data collection, the extant
texts are often described as &ldquo;lecture notes&rdquo;, either
written down or dictated by Aristotle himself as an instrument for
oral performances or by members of his audience as a recording of such
performances. Although such hypotheses explain their generally
condensed nature, some sections display literary qualities (such as
the avoidance of hiatus) which can only result from much more careful
redaction. Research efforts have to this day failed to identify
stylistic criteria on which a chronology of Aristotle&rsquo;s works
could be securely established, it is highly likely that their texts
were revised multiple times by Aristotle or by companions or students
aiming at delivering similar oral performances, so that the extant
texts may be suspected of being an accumulation of temporally distinct
strata.</p>

<p>
Late ancient commentators (especially Ammonius, late 5<sup>th</sup>
century CE, <em>In Cat.</em> 4.5ff., and Simplicius, 6<sup>th</sup>
century, In <em>Phys.</em> 8.16ff.) attribute to Aristotle a writing
procedure which is well attested for later authors (general
description in Dorandi 2000; Menn (m.s. [Other Internet
Resources]). The aspiring author first writes cursory notes
(<em>hupomn&egrave;mata</em>) on various materials recording
interesting ideas, arguments or quotations encountered in conversation
or reading, which are then collected and organized with a view to
preparing a written treatment of a particular topic, before being
reworked into a proper treatise (<em>suggramma</em>) using a much more
polished style which, after some revision and correction, is finally
ready for publication (<em>ekdosis</em>). Aristotle recommends taking
such notes for the purpose of dialectics (<em>Top.</em> 105b12f.) and
several items found in ancient lists of his works could plausibly
correspond to notebooks of this kind. Late ancient commentators tend
to maintain that the works now extant have reached their final form,
their exceptional difficulty being envisaged as a deliberate feature:
Aristotle wished, allegedly, to challenge the philosophical acumen of
his audience.  Modern scholars are much more willing to emphasize that
Aristotle&rsquo;s extant works were in all likelihood intended for a
select audience who had direct access to its author, which explains
their peculiar style.</p>

<p>
There is ample evidence in Aristotle&rsquo;s text of organizing
efforts by Aristotle himself, these were obviously noticed by the
tradition and are consequently reflected in the disposition of the
modern corpus. Aristotle distinguishes in several places (e.g.
<em>Met.</em> E.1) between <em>theoretical</em> sciences which aim at
knowledge (= roughly treatises 1&ndash;29 in the modern corpus as
numbered above), <em>practical</em> sciences which aim at performing
correct actions (ethics and politics, = 37&ndash;42) and
<em>productive</em> sciences which aim at producing determinate
objects (= 43&ndash;5, about how to produce speeches and literary
works). Theoretical sciences are then divided into <em>physics</em> (=
at least 7&ndash;25), <em>mathematics</em> (no clear counterpart in
the modern corpus) and <em>first philosophy</em> (= 36,
<em>Met.</em>). Note that there is no place in Aristotle&rsquo;s
scheme for <em>logic</em>, which an ancient tradition, possibly
starting with Andronicus of Rhodes, nonetheless places at the
beginning of the corpus (= 1&ndash;6, the so-called <em>Organon</em>).
The ancient Aristotelian corpus is already organized along similar
lines in the list found in Diogenes Laertius (3<sup>rd</sup> century
CE), which also includes works in different genres that are now lost,
in (I) dialogues and exoteric works, (II) logic, (III) practical and
productive sciences, (IV) theoretical sciences, (V) notes
(<em>hupomn&egrave;mata</em>), (VI) data collections, (VI) letters and
poems, suggesting that the present disposition of the corpus may go
back, in its basic categories, to the Hellenistic period and possibly
to Aristotle&rsquo;s school.</p>

<p>
The Aristotelian corpus contains many internal cross-references
whereby the reader of a given text is referred to what &ldquo;has been
said&rdquo; or &ldquo;will be said&rdquo; in some other text. They are
all collected in the <em>Aristoteles</em> entry in Bonitz 1870. These
backward and forward references organize the corpus according to an
intended order of study, and not to the chronological sequence of its
composition (Burnyeat 2001, ch.5). Ancient usage about titles is
flexible and Aristotle is no exception to the rule (Fazzo 2010), a
cross-reference may use a denomination denoting the whole treatise
(&ldquo;in the <em>Physics</em>&rdquo;), a special book or part
(&ldquo;in <em>On the Elements</em>&rdquo; = <em>Gen. et Corr.</em>
II) or be completely vague (&ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo;). Some
cross-references are likely to have emerged in the course of revisions
(e.g. if treatise X refers back to Y even though Y is assumed to have
been written after the bulk of X), it is possible (although no hard
proof has ever been given) that some were also introduced by later
editors in order to tie the corpus together. Certain cross-references
are to lost works (for instance <em>On Philosophy</em>), so that the
modern corpus cannot be said to be internally complete. The most
puzzling phenomenon is the presence of (a) &ldquo;blank&rdquo;
cross-references (Burnyeat 2004) which are to works which Aristotle
never wrote according to the extant evidence, such as the treatise
<em>On Nutrition</em>, or in which the topic at hand does not appear,
and (b) mutually inconsistent cross-references (Rashed 2004) which
presuppose incompatible orders of study. Both point again in the
direction of a process of accumulation in the constitution of the
corpus: it is likely that Aristotle (or his editors) evolved in his
projects without always taking care of eliminating textual strata
reflecting earlier versions.</p>

<p>
The modern corpus is still organized according to this ideal order of
study, as it was in ancient times. The organization of
Aristotle&rsquo;s works in Bekker&rsquo;s edition corresponds for the
most part (with some significant exceptions) to an organization found
in the manuscript transmission, in the Neo-Platonist tradition, and in
the ancient list of Aristotle&rsquo;s works attributed to a certain
Ptolemy. The major intellectual figure associated with this ancient
organization is Andronicus of Rhodes (1<sup>st</sup> century BCE), who
seems to have based his work on the evidence provided by
Aristotle&rsquo;s text itself, especially the cross-references it
contains, and in documents pertaining to the activity of
Aristotle&rsquo;s school (such as an epistolary exchange between
Theophrastus and Eudemus of Rhodes, both first-generation members).
The correct order of study of Aristotle&rsquo;s works, as intended by
Aristotle and reconstructed mainly on the basis of this evidence, has
been much discussed in ancient times quite early on: Andronicus of
Rhodes and Boethus of Sidon (1<sup>st</sup> century BCE), for
instance, disagreed on whether one should start with logic or physics,
there are reports of a work <em>On the Order of Aristotle&rsquo;s
Treatises</em> by Adrastus of Aphrodisias (2<sup>nd</sup> century
CE).</p>

<h2 id="GenHisOut">2. General historical outline</h2>

<h3 id="Unt1stCenCESceLeg">2.1 Until the 1<sup>st</sup> century CE: Scepsis and its legend</h3>

<p>
Our information about the earliest stages of the transmission process
that resulted in the Aristotelian corpus we now read is extremely
sparse (general overviews in Moraux 1973 and Gottschalk 1987).
Although Aristotle&rsquo;s works were discussed among his students
(especially Theophrastus of Eresus and Eudemus of Rhodes), there is
little trace of any in-depth engagement with them for most of the
Hellenistic period, between roughly 270 and 90 BCE. A revival of
interest for Aristotle&rsquo;s thought and writings occurred in the
1<sup>st</sup> centuries BCE and CE, centered on <em>Cat.</em>
(Griffin 2015). The period seems to have been decisive for the shaping
of the Aristotelian corpus, the most important piece of information
available comes from a famous ancient anecdote.</p>

<p>
Strabo (<em>Geography</em> XIII, 1.54; 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE) and
Plutarch (<em>Sulla</em> 26; 1<sup>st</sup> century CE) both report a
very entertaining story about the fate of Aristotle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;books&rdquo; or &ldquo;library&rdquo;, meaning both the books
written by others Aristotle had acquired and his own production. It is
not difficult to put together a coherent narrative based on their two
testimonies.</p>

<ol class="jfy">

<li>After Aristotle&rsquo;s death around 322 BCE, his vast collection
of books becomes the property of Theophrastus of Eresus, one of his
dearest colleagues and friends.</li>

<li>Theophrastus (d. c. 287 BCE), after having taken Aristotle&rsquo;s
succession at the head of the Lyceum, bequeaths in turn his library,
including the collection he had inherited from Aristotle, to Neleus
(an old member of the school, himself the son of Coriscus who was
already active in the Academy and the Lyceum). This is confirmed by
the will of Theophrastus reproduced in Diogenes Laertius (V.52).
Strato of Lampsacus (d. c. 269 BCE) becomes the new head of the
Peripatetic school after Theophrastus&rsquo; death.</li>

<li>Neleus takes the books to his hometown of Scepsis, where he dies.
The Lyceum is now deprived of the works of its first two heads and
enters a period of intellectual stagnation (<em>Totenschlaf</em>:
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff 1881, 83).</li>

<li>As the royal dynasty in nearby Pergamon is amassing books in order
to build a prestigious library rivaling Alexandria&rsquo;s,
Neleus&rsquo; heirs in Scepsis, having no particular interest in
philosophy, decide to hide the books in some underground storage
space.</li>

<li>Aristotle&rsquo;s and Theophrastus&rsquo; books remain there for
decades; their state deteriorates due to humidity and worms.</li>

<li>Apellicon of Teos (d. c. 84 BCE), a wealthy collector of
antiquities of great wealth and dubious morals, acquires the whole
collection, now seriously damaged, and, according to Strabo, has the
texts copied in a botched edition in which he desperately tries to
supply missing bits. Apellicon is also reported to have bought
&ldquo;Aristotle&rsquo;s books&rdquo; by Athenaeus
(<em>Deipnosophistae</em> V, 214d; late 2<sup>nd</sup> century
CE).</li>

<li>The Roman general Sulla (138&ndash;78 BCE), having sacked Athens
in 86 BCE, appropriates the collection which is then transferred to
his estate in Rome.</li>

<li>After Sulla&rsquo;s death in 78 BCE, Tyrannio, a Greek scholar
belonging to the same Roman intelligentsia as Cicero, manages to gain
access to Sulla&rsquo;s library and performs some conservation work on
the books from Scepsis.</li>

<li>According to Plutarch, Andronicus of Rhodes obtains from Tyrannio
copies of the books which he uses for his edition of Aristotle&rsquo;s
works.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Andronicus of Rhodes is the only editor of Aristotle mentioned in
ancient sources. His edition must have been published at some point
between 75 BCE and 30 CE; the exact date is controversial. Andronicus
is reported to have also published &ldquo;tables&rdquo;
(<em>pinakes</em>) in at least five books where he provided a
biography of Aristotle and a detailed catalog of Aristotle&rsquo;s
works. The only substantial piece of information about
Andronicus&rsquo; work is provided by Porphyry, who took Andronicus as
a model when preparing his own edition of Plotinus&rsquo; works (301
CE). Porphyry reports that Andronicus &ldquo;arranged the works of
Aristotle and Theophrastus according to their subject-matter,
collecting in the same place the treatments that were akin&rdquo;
(<em>Life of Plotinus</em> 24).</p>

<p>
Four ancient lists of Aristotle&rsquo;s works are extant: <em>(1)</em>
a list is found in Diogenes Laertius&rsquo; entry on Aristotle
(<em>Lives of Eminent Philosophers</em> V.22ff., reference text:
Dorandi 2013; probably 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE), <em>(2)</em>
another surfaced in 1664 along with a biography of Aristotle known as
the <em>Vita Menagiana</em> (reference text: Dorandi 2006) and is
generally assumed to go back to the <em>Onomatologos</em> of Hesychius
of Miletum (another encyclopedia about famous ancient figures;
6<sup>th</sup> century CE), <em>(3)</em> another list is found in an
appendix to the latter of uncertain origin<em>, (4)</em> there is a
very different list in an <em>Epistle</em> attributed to a certain
Ptolemy (probably 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE) that only survives in an
Arabic translation (reference text: Rashed 2021). The first three
lists are essentially identical (bar certain dubious additions in the
appendix). As they are substantially different from the corpus on
which ancient commentators rely after the 1<sup>st</sup> century CE,
they are assumed to reflect a Hellenistic state of the Aristotelian
corpus that had become outdated at this point. By contrast,
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list generally corresponds to the post-Hellenistic
corpus used by later scholars, of which the modern corpus represents
the core part.</p>

<p>
A modern academic legend combines all the elements above into the
following scenario: &ldquo;Aristotle&rsquo;s works were lost for most
of the Hellenistic period, between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the
1<sup>st</sup> century BCE, because the only copies had been stored
underground in Scepsis by Neleus&rsquo; heirs. The only works that
were accessible for this period are the ones found in the lists of
Diogenes Laertius and Hesychius. The complete Aristotelian corpus only
resurfaced in the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE in connection with
Apellicon and Sulla, it was eventually made available to a general
audience thanks to the monumental edition of Andronicus of Rhodes
which is faithfully reflected in Ptolemy&rsquo;s <em>Epistle</em> and
became, much like Bekker&rsquo;s edition today, the reference-point
for subsequent Aristotelian scholars. Andronicus gave its definitive
organization to the disparate and damaged material unearthed by
Apellicon, producing the treatises of Aristotle in their present
form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Following the legend, many features of the Aristotelian corpus, such
as the general structure of certain works or books (regarding
especially <em>Met.</em>, for which the relationships between its
constituent books often appear quite loose), the presence of
transition passages at the beginning or the end of thematically
separate section, or the presence of cross-references that tie
together various works, are suspected of having originated in
Andronicus&rsquo; activity, at some point in the course of the
1<sup>st</sup> century BCE. The co-existence of two book-numbering
systems even in the modern Aristotelian corpus, an archaic one
following the alphabet (book VII is then numbered &zeta;
&ldquo;<em>zeta</em>&rdquo; = the seventh letter of the Greek
alphabet) and a post-classical one using number-letters (book VII is
then numbered &sigmaf; &ldquo;<em>stigma</em>&rdquo; using an
artificial letter that does not belong to the standard alphabet),
might suggest that at least the treatises for which the archaic system
has remained in use (e.g. <em>Met.</em>), were not integrated in
Hellenistic libraries, in which it would otherwise have been updated,
and only resurfaced later (Primavesi 2007).</p>

<p>
There is no denying that important editorial work took place between
the state of the Aristotelian corpus reflected in the lists of
Diogenes Laertius and Hesychius and the state reflected in
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list, the latter being much closer to the corpus on
which ancient commentators rely (of which the modern corpus is a
subset). There are numerous cases (Moraux 1951) in which works which
are registered are self-standing treatises in the first two lists
plausibly correspond to books which are part of larger works in the
latter (e.g. <em>On Diction</em> in two books in Diogenes Laertius =
book III of <em>Rhet.</em> in Ptolemy and in the extant treatise).
Still, there are serious reasons to doubt the veracity of at least
parts of the anecdote and of the subsequent legend.</p>

<p>
<em>(a)</em> The alleged &ldquo;decline&rdquo; of the Peripatetic
school seems to have very little to do with the alleged loss of
Aristotle&rsquo;s and Theophrastus&rsquo; books and very much to do
with a shift towards a research program focused on natural sciences
under Strato and his successors (overview in Lefebvre 2016 or
Baltussen 2016). Instead of assuming that Andronicus&rsquo; edition
suddenly caused a &ldquo;renaissance&rdquo; of the Aristotelian
tradition, it may have been itself motivated by a renewed interest in
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy in the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE (Frede
1999).</p>

<p>
<em>(b)</em> It is difficult to imagine that at the time of
Theophrastus&rsquo; death there existed only one single copy of
Aristotle&rsquo;s works in the whole Greek world (Barnes 1997) and
that most of Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophical treatises remained
virtually unknown during the Hellenistic period. There is evidence
that already within the first generation of Aristotle&rsquo;s students
Eudemus of Rhodes had made his own copies and brought them to his
native island. The matter would be settled once and for all if it
could be shown that some of the works of Aristotle which allegedly
disappeared underground were available to some authors during the
Hellenistic period. The problem is that, although there is evidence of
various engagements with Aristotle&rsquo;s works (Epicurus, for
instance, is reported to have read the <em>Analytics</em>), the most
indisputable form of proof that an author had direct access to a
treatise of Aristotle would be a running commentary. Everything else,
even quotations, could be attributed to second-hand materials, such as
compendia or textbooks that would have recorded some of
Aristotle&rsquo;s views or phrases. Unfortunately, however, the genre
of the philosophical commentary only emerged after the 1<sup>st</sup>
century BCE.</p>

<p>
<em>(c)</em> There are well-attested connections between the Lyceum
and the nascent Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt: Strato,
Theophrastus&rsquo; successor, serves as tutor to the future Ptolemy
II (309&ndash;246 BCE) while Demetrius of Phalerum, another prominent
member of the school, settles in Alexandria after 297 CE where he
seems to have played an important role in the creation of the fabled
library of the Museum. Another ancient author, Athenaeus
(<em>Deipnosophistae</em> I, 3a-b; late 2<sup>nd</sup> century CE)
even reports that all of Aristotle&rsquo;s (and probably
Theophrastus&rsquo;) books were bought from the same Neleus by king
Ptolemy II for the library of Alexandria, thus contradicting the story
found in Strabo and Plutarch.</p>

<p>
<em>(d)</em> Ptolemy&rsquo;s list of Aristotle&rsquo;s works includes
a section entitled &ldquo;books found in Apellicon&rsquo;s
library&rdquo;, under which only vague &ldquo;notes&rdquo;
(<em>hupomn&egrave;mata</em>) and a collection of letters put together
by &ldquo;Artemon&rdquo; (probably Artemon of Pergamon) are
registered. The next item in the list mentions Andronicus, it is again
a collection of both notes and letters that Andronicus is said to have
published for the first time, for which Ptolemy refers his reader to
Andronicus&rsquo; &ldquo;tables&rdquo;. This suggests that everything
else in Ptolemy&rsquo;s list was discovered neither by Apellicon nor
by Andronicus (Rashed 2021).</p>

<p>
<em>(e)</em> The general level of disorganization of the modern
corpus, with its textual doublets, &ldquo;blank&rdquo;
cross-references and incompatible transitions, speaks against its
having been shaped once and for all by a single editor. Porphyry does
not ascribe any work on the details of Aristotle&rsquo;s text to
Andronicus but takes his inspiration from him regarding the operation
of &ldquo;collecting&rdquo; treatises. As the major operation
performed by Porphyry on the text of Plotinus consisted in organizing
his lectures according to thematic principles (instead of chronology)
in three <em>codices</em> (i.e. bound books and not old-fashioned
papyrus scrolls with less writing space), the bulk of
Andronicus&rsquo; editorial activity probably involved identifying,
collecting and organizing Aristotle&rsquo;s treatises according to
subject-matters (Hatzimichali 2013 &amp; 2016) &ndash; perhaps
&ldquo;logic&rdquo;, &ldquo;physics&rdquo;, &ldquo;ethics&rdquo;
&ndash; and adapting them to the new format of the <em>codex</em>,
determining the exact boundaries of each work and of its different
books (Rashed 2021).</p>

<p>
What the legend obscures, by putting Andronicus and his edition on a
pedestal of authority, is the persistence of ancient debates
surrounding the Aristotelian corpus. Andronicus&rsquo; major editorial
decisions, as far as the extant evidence goes, amount to <em>(I)</em>
the condemnation of <em>DI</em> as inauthentic because of a puzzling
cross-reference to <em>DA</em> in 16<sup>a</sup>8f. (which Andronicus
therefore cannot have authored; Moraux 1973, 117&ndash;9),
<em>(II)</em> the rejection of the last part of <em>Cat.</em>
(ch.10&ndash;15, the &ldquo;post-predicaments&rdquo;) as having been
inserted in the treatise by some previous scholars who had wanted
<em>Cat.</em> to serve as an introduction to <em>Top.</em> (Boethius,
<em>In Cat.</em> IV, 64.263bff.; Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>
379.8ff.) and <em>(III)</em> his defense of a division of
<em>Phys.</em> into two parts, books I&ndash;V being the
<em>Physics</em> properly speaking and books VI&ndash;VIII being a
different work entitled <em>On Motion</em>, in favor of which he
adduced evidence from an epistolary exchange between Eudemus and
Theophrastus (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 450.16ff., 801.13ff.,
923.7ff.; Moraux 1973, 115&ndash;6). All three presuppose that
Andronicus viewed himself as reacting to some (allegedly mistaken)
editorial work that had taken place between Aristotle and himself. The
first two decisions have been unanimously rejected by subsequent
ancient scholars.</p>

<h3 id="Bet1stCen9thCETeaAri">2.2 Between the 1<sup>st</sup> century and the 9<sup>th</sup>century CE: teaching Aristotle</h3>

<p>
The canon of Aristotle&rsquo;s works becomes stable in the
2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> centuries CE. The activity of
Alexander of Aphrodisias (around 200 CE), arguably the greatest
ancient commentator on Aristotle, focuses on treatises that are part
of the modern Aristotelian corpus with the same general textual
features. The traditional titles of Aristotle&rsquo;s works seem to
have been well established after this point, although some were still
regarded as challenging (Hoffmann 1997). The Aristotelian corpus
available during this period is still much larger than ours: it
includes (a) Aristotle&rsquo;s published dialogues, (b) collections of
data gathered in the school about various fields (e.g. anatomical
descriptions of various animals, constitutional histories of various
cities), (c) other school materials (collections of divisions,
premises, etc.), (d) treatises in which Aristotle discussed the views
of other thinkers, most prominently of Plato and his school, (e)
various scientific works on specific topics. All of this has been
lost. Taking into account the missing parts is liable to change
one&rsquo;s outlook on Aristotle&rsquo;s output or biography:
Aristotle&rsquo;s lost dialogues, assuming that they contained views
close to Plato&rsquo;s and incompatible with the views put forward in
the school works, have been used in Neo-Platonism as evidence for the
existence of an agreement between Aristotle and Plato, assuming that
there is no inconsistency between the dialogues and the esoteric works
(Gerson 2005, ch.2), and in modern times by proponents of
developmental theories as evidence for a Platonist phase in
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophical trajectory (famously by Jaeger
1923),</p>

<p>
As with every ancient text, Aristotle&rsquo;s works could only
circulate thanks to a repeated process of copying which inevitably
introduced errors in the text. Some would have been easy to spot,
others may have resulted in more dramatic results, such as skipping
lines. Moreover, Aristotle&rsquo;s style in the extant treatises is so
uniquely terse that any serious reading or teaching activity is likely
to introduce many glosses and exegetical annotations in the original
text. As ancient practices do not always clearly demarcate between
textual corrections and other types of para-text (glosses, musings,
signposts, etc.), this material tended to find its way into the
original text. The process is aggravated by the composition of ancient
paraphrases (Andronicus had already written one for <em>Cat.</em>)
that aimed at conveying the same message in clearer terms and
sometimes ended up replacing the original.</p>

<p>
Ancient readers were aware of these dangers and tried, whenever
possible, to use authoritative copies of the text and sometimes
compared several copies. Ancient commentators on Aristotle, starting
with Aspasius and Alexander, often report on variant readings or even
alternative versions. As a result, their works offer an invaluable
testimony regarding the ancient state of Aristotle&rsquo;s text, which
is sometimes found to differ significantly from the evidence found in
medieval manuscripts, offering glimpses of a much more diverse ancient
textual landscape. Aspasius, for instance, discusses five textual
variants in his commentary on the <em>Ethics</em> (Barnes 1999), is
the source for Alexander&rsquo;s report (<em>In Met.</em> 58.31ff.)
about a correction made by Eudorus of Alexandria (1<sup>st</sup>
century BCE) in the text of <em>Met.</em> A.6 (this correction has
prevailed in the manuscript transmission: Primavesi 2024) and has
access to a redacted version of <em>Phys.</em> (Moraux 1984, 289).</p>

<p>
From the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE onward, Aristotle&rsquo;s
treatises, especially the <em>Organon</em>, were mostly studied as an
introduction to Plato in the Neo-Platonist schools of Athens and
Alexandria, which exerted a major influence on the Arabic and
Byzantine receptions of Aristotle. Their decline and eventual
disappearance, under growing Christian pressure and later Muslim
conquests in the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> centuries, led to
the loss of a large share of ancient philosophical literature,
including most of what is now lost within the ancient Aristotelian
corpus. Even for the treatises that were preserved, the number of
available copies seems to have drastically shrunk, which had a
negative impact on the quality of the copies that were subsequently
produced.</p>

<h3 id="ByzPerC850">2.3 The Byzantine period (c. 850&ndash;1453)</h3>

<p>
Within the context of a renewed interest in ancient culture in the
Byzantine empire of the 9<sup>th</sup> century, ancient texts were
gradually transcribed from carefully selected late ancient copies
using a new writing system: the process involved switching from
majuscule to minuscule script (Greek
<em>metacharacht&egrave;rismos</em>, Latin <em>translitteratio</em>),
thus saving precious space. Only a few minuscule copies were produced
directly against the old majuscule copies for most ancient works;
these are the source for later medieval manuscripts. In the case of
Aristotelian texts, the manuscript transmission usually goes back to
one, two or three such copies.</p>

<p>
The earliest extant manuscripts of Aristotle were produced around this
period in the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> centuries, mostly in
Constantinople. The manuscript with shelf-marks Vatican, <em>Urb.</em>
<em>gr.</em> 35 (commonly referred to by means of the <em>siglum</em>
A since Bekker&rsquo;s edition; early 10<sup>th</sup> century)
preserves the <em>Organon</em>; Vienna, &Ouml;NB, <em>phil. gr.</em>
100 (J; mid-9<sup>th</sup> c.) and Paris, BnF, grec 1853 (E;
mid-10<sup>th</sup> c.) preserve most of the treatises of natural
philosophy along with <em>Met.</em>; Oxford, Corpus Christi College,
108 (Z; early 9<sup>th</sup> c.) preserves the zoological treatises;
Paris, BnF, grec 1741 (A<sup>c</sup> ; second half of the
10<sup>th</sup> c.) preserves <em>Rhet</em> and <em>Poet..</em>; parts
of <em>Pol.</em> are preserved in Vatican, <em>Vat.</em> <em>gr.</em>
1298 (10<sup>th</sup> c.; it is a palimpsest: an old copy of
Aristotelian text has been recycled as material on which another text
has been copied). <em>Urb.</em> <em>gr.</em> 35 was produced for the
high-ranking church official and scholar Arethas of Caesarea (c.
860&ndash;c. 935), himself a student of Photius. No personal
manuscript of famous Byzantine scholars such as Photius
(9<sup>th</sup> c.) or Michael Psellos (11<sup>th</sup> c.) has
survived, although there was definitely some engagement with Aristotle
during the period. Imperial princess Anna Comnena sponsored the
composition of new commentaries on Aristotle in the first half of the
12<sup>th</sup> century by scholars such as Eustratius of Nicea and
Michael of Ephesus, focusing on works which had been neglected by the
ancient commentary tradition.</p>

<p>
The Latin conquest and sack of Constantinople in 1204 marks an
important turning point. The city, which had served as the cultural
center of the Greek-speaking world, remained under Western control
until 1264. Many cultural artifacts, especially manuscripts, were
looted or destroyed. Ancient texts that were still available in
Constantinople before 1204 disappeared, including Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Anatomies</em> which Michael of Ephesus could still read. Still,
Constantinople was far from the only place where Aristotle was read in
Greek. There were intellectually active Greek-speaking communities in
Southern Italy and Sicily, in which a special version of <em>EE</em>
was preserved (Harlfinger 1971).</p>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s treatises were also translated in other languages
during the medieval period. Some works, mostly from the
<em>Organon</em>, had already been translated into Latin in ancient
times (by Boethius, 6<sup>th</sup> c.) and into Syriac in connection
with the diffusion of Neoplatonist thought. After the Islamic
conquests of Syria and Egypt (where the city of Alexandria was a major
Greek cultural center) in the 7<sup>th</sup> century as well as
cultural exchanges with Byzantium, most of the Aristotelian corpus was
translated in Arabic. Major translation movements occurred within the
so-called &ldquo;circle of al-Kind&#299;&rdquo; in the 9<sup>th</sup>
century, in the circle of &#7716;unayn ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q and his
son in the late 9<sup>th</sup> century, and in 10<sup>th</sup>-century
Baghdad. Even though not all these translations have survived, they
are often observed to be exceptional textual witnesses as they draw on
a textual tradition that is distinct from the one attested in
Byzantine manuscripts.</p>

<p>
The whole Aristotelian corpus was gradually translated into Latin
during the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries. Some
translations were made by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187) in Toledo based
on pre-existing Arabic translations. Others were made using Greek
copies found in Constantinople and in other parts of the
Greek-speaking world, most notably by James of Venice and in Sicily by
Henricus Aristippus around the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century.
These medieval translations were collected along with Boethius&rsquo;
into a &ldquo;<em>corpus vetustius</em>&rdquo; which became standard
reference material in Western European universities at the beginning
of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. This <em>corpus vetustius</em> does
not cover the whole Aristotelian corpus that has survived in Greek,
and its translations are often difficult to understand without the
underlying Greek (if not at times completely obscure). The whole
extant corpus was translated into Latin, either for the first time or
in a revised form, in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, for the most part
by Dominican friar William of Moerbeke (d. c. 1286), who often acted
as a diplomatic intermediary between the papal court and Byzantium and
had access to exceptional Greek libraries. Subsequently, a new
collection, the <em>corpus recentius</em>, emerged, which became the
standard Latin edition of Aristotle&rsquo;s works until the
Renaissance.</p>

<h3 id="RenBey">2.4 The Renaissance and beyond</h3>

<p>
After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, many Byzantine
scholars took refuge in the island of Crete (then under the control of
Venice) and in Italy, where interest for Greek language and culture
had been steadily growing since the end of the 14<sup>th</sup>
century. The most famous is Bessarion, who eventually became a
cardinal of the Catholic church. Bessarion hired many other exiles as
scribes in an effort to preserve as much of Greek culture as possible
in a vast library which he eventually donated to the city of Venice in
1468. More generally, a rush for Greek manuscripts among Western
scholars and nobility led to the constitution of many prestigious
collections during the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries,
which form the backbone of the Greek holdings of many present-day
Western European libraries. Most extant Aristotle manuscripts were
accordingly produced during the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>
The first printed edition of Aristotle&rsquo;s works (<em>editio
princeps</em>) in the original Greek was published between 1495 and
1498 by the press of Aldus Manutius in Venice. It is generally based
on 15<sup>th</sup>-century manuscripts that were circulating in
academic circles at the time. Bar a few discrepancies (its text of
<em>Lin.</em> is actually a paraphrase written by Pachymeres c. 1300),
it corresponds to the modern Aristotelian corpus. Many editions of
Aristotle&rsquo;s works were later published in the 16<sup>th</sup>
century, gradually introducing a chapter-division in Aristotle&rsquo;s
text that has no basis in the manuscript transmission. The now
traditional chapter-division was definitively established in the
edition published in Basel in 1551 and prepared by Michael Isengrin.
All these editions adopt as their starting point the text of some
previous printed edition (usually the Aldine edition) and introduce
additional corrections either based on alternative manuscripts or as
editorial conjectures, often without explicitly distinguishing between
the two. Bekker&rsquo;s 1831 edition is the first complete printed
edition that starts afresh from a selection of medieval manuscripts,
doing away with the accumulation of Renaissance correction attempts,
and makes the relationship between the printed text and the manuscript
evidence explicit by means of a critical apparatus signaling the
various manuscript readings available for each line of text.</p>

<h2 id="AncModDeb">3. Ancient and modern debates</h2>

<h3 id="Org">3.1 The <em>Organon</em></h3>

<p>
The modern <em>Organon</em> corresponds to Aristotle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;logic&rdquo; and runs as follows: <em>Cat.</em>, <em>DI</em>,
<em>APr</em>, <em>APo, Top., SE</em>. While there are textual
indications that the two <em>Analytics</em> are parts of the same
project and that <em>SE</em> is meant to follow <em>Top</em>. (there
is an inconsistency in the textual evidence, as <em>SE</em> is
sometimes presented as a part of <em>Top</em>. and sometimes as a
separate treatise: Brunschwig 2004), Aristotle is certainly not
responsible for grouping these treatises in this way under this label.
Logic is not acknowledged by Aristotle as a special science or part of
philosophy, the denomination &ldquo;<em>organon</em>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;instrument&rdquo;, see Barnes 2007), which has not been coined
by Aristotle (its exact origin is unknown), reflects Hellenistic
controversies regarding its status. The sequence follows a sort of
compositional linguistic progression reminiscent of Stoic philosophy,
going from the elementary constituents of speech (<em>Cat.</em>) to
propositions (<em>DI</em>) and then to deduction
(<em>sullogismos</em>) under its various types (general theory:
<em>APr</em>; scientific deduction: <em>APo</em>; dialectical:
<em>Top</em>; eristic or sophistical: <em>SE</em>). It distorts the
content of the first two treatises, as <em>Cat.</em> and <em>DI</em>
are autonomous works that deal simultaneously with grammar, semantics,
ontology and psychology and have little to do with Aristotle&rsquo;s
logical theory of deduction (Brunschwig 1989).</p>

<p>
The modern <em>Organon</em> is identical to the one advocated by
Alexander of Aphrodisias. There are alternative ancient arrangements.
The list of Aristotle&rsquo;s work in Diogenes Laertius does not place
<em>Cat.</em> and <em>DI</em> in its main logical part, which has
<em>APr</em> and <em>APo</em> precede <em>Top.</em> (under a different
title). Most books in <em>Top.</em> also appear as independent works.
The doxographical section in Diogenes Laertius organizes
Aristotle&rsquo;s logic in a different way than his list, following a
scheme originating in the Hellenistic Academy (III.28&ndash;9;
Gourinat 2013): invention (<em>Top.</em> and two lost works entitled
<em>Methodics</em> and <em>Premises</em>), judgment (the two
<em>Analytics</em>) and use (which includes <em>SE</em>).
Andronicus&rsquo; organization of Aristotle&rsquo;s logic is
uncertain: his version of the <em>Organon</em> cannot have included
<em>DI</em> which he deemed inauthentic, it may have positioned
<em>Cat.</em> in a different place given that Andronicus rejected an
alternative title &ldquo;<em>Before the Topics</em>&rdquo;. In
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list, <em>Top.</em> is placed after <em>APr</em>
(under the title &ldquo;<em>Analytics</em>&rdquo;) and before
<em>Apo.</em> (under the title &ldquo;<em>Apodictics</em>&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
The status of <em>Rhet.</em> and <em>Poet.</em> has given rise to much
controversy, due in no small part to Aristotle&rsquo;s opening
statement that rhetoric is the &ldquo;counterpart&rdquo;
(<em>antistroph&egrave;</em>) of dialectic (<em>Rhet.</em>
1354<sup>a</sup>1; Brunschwig 1994). The two treatises are excluded
from the <em>Organon</em> in the modern corpus. Neo-Platonist
commentators in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries have
taken different stances (Gourinat 2013): although Ammonius also
excludes them from the <em>Organon</em> as did Alexander of
Aphrodisias, Simplicius includes <em>Rhet</em>. and excludes
<em>Poet.</em> as Galen and Alcinoos seem to have done in the
2<sup>nd</sup> century, while Olympiodorus and Elias, followed by
Philoponus, include both <em>Rhet.</em> and <em>Poet.</em> in the
<em>Organon</em>. This &ldquo;longer&rdquo; <em>Organon</em> is the
version that has reached the Arabic Aristotelian tradition, where it
has led to the development of a notion of a &ldquo;poetic&rdquo; type
of deduction.</p>

<p>
The composition of <em>Cat.</em> as it is transmitted appears
suspicious (Frede 1999). Olympiodorus (<em>In Cat.</em> 22.38ff.)
reports that the authenticity of the treatise had been questioned
especially because it introduces views that are allegedly contradicted
in other places in the corpus. There are ancient reports about
alternative versions, one of which was still read by Adrastus of
Aphrodisias and seems to have been a sort of paraphrastic version
intended to resolve certain ambiguities in Aristotle&rsquo;s text
(Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 18.16ff.; Ammonius, <em>In Cat.</em>
13.20ff.). Out of Aristotle&rsquo;s ten categories, only four are
seriously examined in the extant treatise (substance, quantity,
relatives and quality). The last part of the treatise deals with
general notions (&ldquo;post-predicaments&rdquo;, ch.10&ndash;15) that
apply across the categories, including a short treatment of
<em>having</em> even though <em>having</em> is supposed to feature
among the ten categories. This last part was regarded as an insertion
by Andronicus. The very title <em>Categories</em> does not seem to
have been used by Aristotle, there is at least one ancient alternative
title <em>Before the Places</em> (= before the <em>Topics</em>) found
in Diogenes Laertius which is reported to have been rejected by
Andronicus (and still defended two centuries later by Adrastus of
Aphrodisias).</p>

<p>
The authenticity of <em>DI</em> had also been attacked by Andronicus
based on a &ldquo;blank&rdquo; reference to <em>DA</em>, without
leaving any major impact on the ancient reception of the work. It
seems actually to result from a textual corruption (Maier 1900). Book
V of <em>Top.</em> is likely to be inauthentic in view of its lack of
consistency and to have been compiled at an early date (before
Alexander of Aphrodisias), possibly on the basis of Aristotelian
materials (Reinhardt 2000). The existence of a lost second book of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Poetics</em> and its relationship to the extant
text are disputed (Veloso 2018, 401&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
Aristotle refers to either the <em>Prior</em> or <em>Posterior
Analytics</em> under the general label
&ldquo;<em>Analytics</em>&rdquo;, suggesting that they are meant to
form one single work (Brunschwig 1981, Crubellier 2008). Even if the
current way of distinguishing between the two is already attested in
the list in Diogenes Laertius, the titles and the relation of the two
<em>Analytics</em> were still debated in the first centuries CE, as
Galen (<em>On My Own Books</em>, 14.12) expresses his preference for
calling the former <em>On Deduction</em> and the latter <em>On
Demonstrations</em> (a title similar to the title <em>Apodictics</em>
in Ptolemy&rsquo;s list) on the basis of Aristotle&rsquo;s own usage,
while Alexander of Aphrodisias tries to discern this very meaning
behind the traditional labels &ldquo;prior&rdquo; and
&ldquo;posterior&rdquo; (<em>In APr</em> 42.22f.).</p>

<h3 id="NatSci">3.2 Natural science</h3>

<p>
The part of the Aristotelian corpus that deals with nature
(&ldquo;<em>physics</em>&rdquo; in the broad sense) is unified and
ordered by the prologue of <em>Meteor.</em> (338a20ff.). It has two
main subparts, the first four treatises being a general investigation
into the universe and its dynamic structure, followed by a study of
animal and vegetal living beings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We have already discussed the first causes of nature, and all natural
motion (= <em>Phys.</em>), also the stars ordered in the motion of the
heavens (= <em>DC</em>), and the corporeal elements&mdash; enumerating
and specifying them and showing how they change into one
another&mdash; and becoming and perishing in general (= <em>Gen. et
Corr.</em>). There remains for consideration a part of this inquiry
which all our predecessors called meteorology (= <em>Meteor</em>). It
is concerned with events that are natural, though their order is less
perfect than that of the first of the elements of bodies (&hellip;)
When the inquiry into these matters is concluded let us consider what
account we can give, in accordance with the method we have followed,
of animals and plants, both generally and in detail. When that has
been done we may say that the whole of our original undertaking will
have been carried out. (<em>ROT</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first two sentences prescribe an order of study for the first four
treatises which is followed by the ancient tradition. Each still
presents special challenges.</p>

<p>
There is an ancient debate about <em>Phys.</em> involving Andronicus,
our main source being Simplicius who relies here on Adrastus (<em>In
Phys.</em> 4.11ff, 801.13ff. and 924.13ff.; <em>In DC</em> 226.19).
The lists of Diogenes Laertius and Hesychius provide some evidence
that some of its books have circulated as self-standing works. Their
collection was sometimes called &ldquo;<em>On Principles</em>&rdquo;
and sometimes &ldquo;<em>Lecture on Nature</em>&rdquo;, as in the
manuscript transmission. Within the eight books we now call
<em>Phys.</em>, Andronicus distinguished two parts, calling the first
five books the <em>Physics</em> and the next three books <em>On
Motion</em>, apparently offering in support a quotation from a letter
of Theophrastus to Eudemus in which the fifth book was said to be part
of the <em>Physics</em>. Others, including Porphyry and Philoponus
(<em>In Phys.</em> 2.15f.), divided the work in two parts having four
books each, the first four being called <em>On Principles</em> and the
last four <em>On Motion.</em> The debate probably originated in the
comparison of the internal cross-references to <em>Phys.</em> in the
corpus where the label &ldquo;on motion&rdquo; is used (<em>DC</em>
272a30f. and 275b21f.) and hinges on a conceptual tension between
books III and V (Brunschwig 1991): &ldquo;motion&rdquo;
(<em>kin&egrave;sis</em>) refers in the former to any kind of change,
including change according to substance, whereas it only refers to
non-substantial change in the latter. Book VII has long been observed
to be problematic, as it offers a proof for the existence of the Prime
Mover which seems to be made redundant by the much more detailed
argument of book VIII. Eudemus of Rhodes skipped it in his own work on
<em>Phys.</em> (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 1036.13f.), Simplicius
knows of a very different version of its text (1036.4f.) which has
been preserved in part of the manuscript tradition for the first
chapters, it is unclear whether one of the two is inauthentic.</p>

<p>
<em>DC</em> reads very much like a series of three distinct treatises
about the heavens (books I&ndash;II), the elements (book III) and
weight (book IV). Simplicius reports an ancient debate about the way
its traditional title relates to its content (<em>In DC</em> 1.1ff.):
Alexander explained the title by arguing that &ldquo;the heaven&rdquo;
(<em>ouranos</em>) should be understood as meaning &ldquo;the
world&rdquo; (<em>kosmos</em>) whereas Iamblichus reserved the word
&ldquo;heaven&rdquo; for the supralunary region studied in the first
two books. Book III seems to answer to the same project as <em>Gen. et
Corr.</em> and actually announces a study of generation and corruption
in its first chapter, so that <em>Gen. et Corr.</em> could be read as
its direct continuation, as there is little textual evidence that it
was intended as a self-standing work (Brunschwig 2004).</p>

<p>
Within <em>Meteor.</em>, book I has been accused in ancient times of
being inauthentic (Olympiodorus, <em>In Meteor.</em> 4.16ff.), one of
the main arguments being that it makes use of an extra-missive theory
of sight that is rejected in <em>DA</em> II and <em>Sens</em>. While
the end of book III announces an investigation about the formation of
rocks and metals based on Aristotle&rsquo;s double exhalation theory,
book IV offers a much more general treatment of the formation of
simple bodies that does not rely on this theory but on other notions,
such as pores (ch.8&ndash;9), with questionable Aristotelian
credentials (Gottschalk 1961). Ancient commentators were already quite
embarrassed by the situation regarding book IV, Alexander of
Aphrodisias questioned whether the book really belonged to the
treatise as its subject-matter is much closer to that of <em>Gen. et
Corr.</em> (<em>In Meteor.</em> 179.3ff., Natali 2002). The medieval
Latin translations tried to get rid of the issue by inserting a short
treatise <em>On Minerals</em> which is itself a translation of a
section of Avicenna&rsquo;s <em>Shif&#257;&#702;</em>
(<em>Cure</em>).</p>

<p>
The description of the study about &ldquo;animals and plants&rdquo;
that is said to follow the general study of nature is too cursory in
the prologue of <em>Meteor.</em> to be precisely related to the extant
works. While Aristotle&rsquo;s work on plants is lost, numerous
treatises about animals have been preserved. There are many clues in
Aristotle&rsquo;s text that provide some information about their
intended order of study, but they are not always mutually consistent
(Rashed 2004). The general sequence starts with <em>PA</em> I, which
serves as a general introduction to the study of animals (although the
book itself looks much like a &ldquo;string of papers&rdquo;, Balme
1972) and ends with <em>GA</em>, which was probably supposed to be
followed by the lost treatise on plants. The remaining books of
<em>PA</em> are traditionally followed by <em>IA</em>, which extends
the project to the study of the locomotive parts of animals. There are
textual indications that <em>DA</em>, <em>PN</em> and <em>MA</em>
should be placed between <em>PA</em>-<em>IA</em> and <em>GA</em>, as
is the case in the ancient tradition and in the manuscript
transmission. This is not the case in the modern corpus:
Bekker&rsquo;s edition places <em>DA</em> and <em>PN</em> after the
four general physical treatises (augmented with the
pseudo-Aristotelian <em>Mund.</em>) and before the zoological
treatises, thus suggesting that &ldquo;psychology&rdquo; is a separate
discipline from zoology. Bekker&rsquo;s radical decision derives from
intense debates in the Renaissance about the status of the study of
the soul in Aristotle&rsquo;s project (Perfetti 2000).</p>

<p>
It is uncertain whether <em>HA</em>, which is an organized collection
of zoological data, belongs to the sequence as one of its first
members or should stand outside of it as a repository. An entry in
Diogenes Laertius suggests that its tenth and last book had circulated
as an independent treatise <em>On Sterility</em>. Its authenticity is
still debated on doctrinal grounds, as is the question of whether it
really belongs to the treatise (Eijk 1999). The order of the various
books of the treatise in the manuscript transmission has been
rearranged by Theodorus Gaza (along with some portions of texts) in
his 1476 Latin translation, placing what is transmitted as book IX in
seventh place. His decision was followed in most editions before being
reversed in Balme 2002.</p>

<p>
The composition of <em>PN</em> is especially difficult. The Latin
title (<em>Parva naturalia,</em> &ldquo;short works on natural
topics&rdquo;) of the collection seems to have been coined in the
13<sup>th</sup> century in the circle of Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;
students. Its treatises have no such collective designation in the
ancient tradition, even though they are clearly unified by the
prologue of <em>Sens.</em> which introduces all of their
subject-matters. The treatise <em>MA</em> is regarded as part and
parcel of <em>PN</em> in the ancient tradition (in accordance with the
cross-reference in <em>DA</em> 431<sup>b</sup>20) but is removed from
the collection in Bekker&rsquo;s edition where <em>MA</em> is
associated with <em>IA</em> instead in the zoological section. Some
indications in Aristotle&rsquo;s text, especially in the prologue of
<em>Sens.</em> presuppose that the whole <em>PN</em> (<em>MA</em>
included) should follow <em>DA</em> and precede <em>GA</em> while
others suggest dividing the collection into two separate parts, one
following <em>DA</em> and one following <em>GA</em>.</p>

<h3 id="Met">3.3 The <em>Metaphysics</em></h3>

<p>
The treatise has been a riddle since ancient times (general
presentation: Menn m.s. [Other Internet Resources]), as many of its
features denote editorial intervention &ndash; and in view of the
difficulty of understanding how Aristotle&rsquo;s explicit project of
a &ldquo;first philosophy&rdquo; relates to the extant material. The
<em>Metaphysics</em> contains <em>two</em> &ldquo;Book One&rdquo;,
traditionally called &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; (= number 1)
&ldquo;major&rdquo; (A) and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; (&alpha;) on account
of their respective lengths. Some sections of its text constitute
doublets as they are found to be identical either within the treatise
itself (e.g. if one compares A.9 with M.4&ndash;5) or within the
larger corpus (e.g. if one compares &Delta;.2 with <em>Phys.</em>
II.3). It is controversial whether the work as it now stands was
intended by Aristotle as a unified project or put together at a later
date. Book &Delta;, for instance, is a series of entries about key
philosophical terms, it likely corresponds to a separate entry in
Diogenes&rsquo; and Hesychius&rsquo; lists (with the title <em>On
Things Said in Several Ways</em>). There is an ancient tradition
associating the treatise with Aristotle&rsquo;s student Eudemus of
Rhodes: Asclepius (<em>In Met.</em> 4.4&ndash;16; 6<sup>th</sup> c.
CE), perhaps relying on Alexander of Aphrodisias, relates that the
work was sent by Aristotle to Eudemus, who recommended that it should
not be published. Some parts were allegedly later destroyed, which
incompetent editors tried to supply by drawing from other Aristotelian
works.</p>

<p>
Its Greek title (<em>meta ta phusika</em>, &ldquo;after natural
things&rdquo; or &ldquo;after <em>Phys.</em>&rdquo;; other alternative
such as <em>First Philosophy</em> were also known in late antiquity)
does not refer to a special area within philosophy. This is, however,
the actual historical origin of the word &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo;. It
probably indicates the position of the treatise within the order of
study intended by Aristotle (Alexander, <em>In Met.</em>
171.4&ndash;8) or within the organization given to the corpus by an
ancient editor. The origin of the title is uncertain but is in all
likelihood Hellenistic, the treatise appears with this title in
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list (with 13 books, and not 14 as is the case today)
and in Hesychius (with 10 or 20 books) but not in the list found in
Diogenes Laertius (perhaps due to a mechanical loss).</p>

<p>
There is evidence that the authenticity of book A had already been
questioned in Alexander&rsquo;s time, as Alexander feels the need to
defend it (<em>In Met.</em> 196.20&ndash;5). Asclepius reports that
&ldquo;some&rdquo; have attributed the book to Pasicles of Rhodes,
Eudemus&rsquo; brother about whom little else is known (<em>In
Met.</em> 4.17&ndash;35; a scholium in manuscript Paris, grec 1853
points in the same direction: Vuillemin-Diem 1983, Berti 1982). Its
coexistence with book &alpha; points toward an earlier state of the
treatise where only one &ldquo;first book&rdquo; was known, which
might be reflected in the entry in Ptolemy stating that the work has
13 books. There are traces of philosophically motivated textual
interventions in the manuscript transmission of book &Alpha;
(Primavesi 2012 &amp; 2024). The status of book &alpha;, which is much
shorter and, although it is certainly an introduction, hardly connects
directly with the following book B, is much discussed in the
commentaries of Alexander and Asclepius, its authenticity has been
questioned in modern scholarship. Alexander reports that some had held
book &Delta; to be incomplete, as it does not contain a discussion of
everything that is said in several ways (<em>In Met.</em> 345.4ff.).
The first part of book K (ch.1&ndash;7) reads like a summary of books
&Gamma;&Delta;&Epsilon; while its second part (ch.8&ndash;12) looks
like a compilation from various places in <em>Phys</em>. As a result,
there are serious doubts about its authenticity (Aubenque 1983). Part
of the manuscript transmission offers an additional bit of text in
book &Theta; which, even if it seems to be genuinely Aristotelian, is
generally interpreted as being out of place (Burnyeat 2008). Syrianus
(<em>In Met.</em> 160.6ff.; early 5<sup>th</sup> c.) signals the
existence of a debate about the exact boundary between the last two
books &Mu; and &Nu;.</p>

<h3 id="EthPol">3.4 Ethics and Politics</h3>

<p>
There are four ethical treatises in the modern Aristotelian corpus:
<em>EN</em>, <em>EE</em>, <em>MM</em> and the pseudo-Aristotelian
<em>Virt</em>. <em>MM</em> is generally assumed to be a sort of
summary of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> produced within the
school. Its title (&ldquo;great ethics&rdquo;) reflects, not its
superior prestige, but the special length of its books compared to
<em>EN</em> and <em>EE</em>.</p>

<p>
Broadly speaking, <em>EN</em>, <em>EE</em> and <em>MM</em> are quite
similar, both in their philosophical views and in structure. All three
deal with the same topics in the same order: happiness and the good;
moral virtues; intellectual virtues; vices and weakness of the will;
friendship. <em>EN</em> and <em>EE</em> share no less than three
books, the so-called &ldquo;common books&rdquo; (<em>EE</em>
IV&ndash;VI = <em>EN</em> V&ndash;VII). Numerous modern editions and
translations of <em>EE</em>, starting with Bekker, omits these books,
assuming that they properly belong to <em>EN</em> (this is not the
case with the manuscript transmission, although some manuscripts with
both <em>EE</em> and <em>EN</em> do not have the common books twice:
Harlfinger 1971).</p>

<p>
The relationship between <em>EN</em> and <em>EE</em> and the status of
these &ldquo;common books&rdquo; are controversial. <em>EN</em> has
generally been favored in modern literature while <em>EE</em>, placed
after <em>EN</em> and <em>MM</em> in Bekker&rsquo;s edition, was often
envisaged as inauthentic in the 19<sup>th</sup>-century (see
<em>contra</em> Kenny 1978, along with Natali 2019). The &ldquo;common
books&rdquo; may have originally belonged to one of the two
<em>Ethics</em> and have later been added to the other by editors, or
it could be that the two <em>Ethics</em> are already editorial
artifacts and that both or none originally contained the common books.
If they are included in <em>EN</em>, <em>EN</em> VII.12&ndash;14 forms
an odd sort of doublet with <em>EN</em> X.1&ndash;5, both offering
self-contained studies of pleasure. The composition of <em>EN</em> VII
/ <em>EE</em> VI is in any case problematic, because it is composed of
two seemingly unconnected main parts that deal with separate topics
(weakness of the will, ch.1&ndash;11; pleasure, ch.12&ndash;14).</p>

<p>
The exact meaning of the adjectives <em>Eudemian</em> and
<em>Nicomachean</em>, which function as a pair, in the two traditional
titles remains obscure. No ancient list records the two: there is only
one <em>Ethics</em> (in five books) in the list of Diogenes Laertius,
although some books seem to have circulated independently (<em>On
Justice</em> may well be <em>EN</em> V / <em>EE</em> IV),
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list mentions both <em>MM</em> and <em>EE</em> but not
<em>EN</em>. The title <em>EN</em> seems to be already known to
Cicero, the earliest occurrence of the title <em>EE</em> is apparently
found in Ptolemy&rsquo;s list. &ldquo;Eudemus&rdquo; must be
Aristotle&rsquo;s associate Eudemus of Rhodes,
&ldquo;Nicomachus&rdquo; is either Aristotle&rsquo;s father, a
well-respected doctor, or his son, who died before the age of 21 in
battle (both had the same name). The two main hypotheses are (a) that
the titles reflect some form of authorship or editorship (which is
made difficult by the fact that there is no trace of any philosophical
or philological activity undertaken by Aristotle&rsquo;s father or
son) or (b) that each <em>Ethics</em> has been dedicated (by later
editors?) to Eudemus and Aristotle&rsquo;s son (this is the way
<em>EE</em> is registered in Ptolemy&rsquo;s list). Some ancient
sources evoke the first hypothesis: Cicero (<em>De finibus</em> V.12)
seems to assume that Nicomachus is the author of <em>EN</em>. A
commentary by Aspasius is preserved for books I&ndash;IV of
<em>EN</em> and for the last two &ldquo;common books&rdquo;, in which
Aspasius wonders whether a passage of <em>EN</em> VII / <em>EE</em> VI
could have been written by Eudemus of Rhodes (<em>In EN</em>,
151.18ff.): it might suggest that Aspasius thought that the
&ldquo;common books&rdquo; originally belonged to <em>EE</em> and that
the title indicated that Eudemus had written at least part of them.
Later sources are clueless about the meaning of the titles
(Olympiodorus, <em>Proleg.</em> 7.34&ndash;6) or adopt the second
hypothesis (Elias, <em>In Cat.</em> 116.15&ndash;9).</p>

<p>
<em>Pol.</em> appears in Diogenes&rsquo; list in a surprising
conjunction with the name of Theophrastus (&ldquo;lecture on politics
like that of Theophrastus&rsquo;&rdquo;), which could suggest that he
played a part in putting the treatise together, as well as in
Hesychius&rsquo; and Ptolemy&rsquo;s without any such indication. It
is difficult to make sense of the composition of the treatise which
hardly reads like a continuous argument, various alternative orderings
of its books have been proposed from the 14<sup>th</sup> century
onward (e.g. by placing books VII and VIII after book III).</p>

<h3 id="Spu">3.5 <em>Spuria</em></h3>

<p>
The modern Aristotelian corpus includes several works dealing with
various topics that are now generally acknowledged as inauthentic,
even though ancient writers may have held the opposite view. Most seem
to have been produced in the school within a few generations of
Aristotle&rsquo;s activity: <em>Spir.</em> (perhaps found in
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list)<em>, Col.,</em> <em>Phgn.</em> (perhaps found in
Diogenes&rsquo; and Hesychius&rsquo; lists), <em>Mir</em>. (found in
Hesychius&rsquo;), <em>MM</em> (found in Ptolemy&rsquo;s),
<em>Virt.</em>, <em>Oec.</em> (perhaps found in Diogenes&rsquo; and
Hesychius&rsquo;). Scholars have contemplated attributing some of them
to other figures of the Lyceum, most notably to Theophrastus or
Strato. As with some dialogues produced within the Academy which have
later come to be transmitted under the name of Plato, these treatises
seem to have been aggregated to Aristotle&rsquo;s works by ancient
editors due to their provenience. Ancient scholars were aware of the
situation, Neoplatonist commentaries often include a discussion of the
authenticity of the treatise at hand. Ammonius, for instance, used to
explain the presence of forgeries in the corpus by pointing out (1)
that in Hellenistic times, kings used to pay hefty sums of money for
new texts for their libraries, prompting some to come up with
Aristotelian treatises of their own, (2) that confusion arose when
different works had similar titles or one work several titles, and (3)
that disciples sometimes put out their own work as having been
produced by the master (M&uuml;ller 1969).</p>

<p>
The most obvious case of deliberate forgery is the <em>Rhetoric to
Alexander</em>, a compilation of rhetorical treatises roughly
contemporary with Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Rhet.</em> produced in the
second half of the 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE, prefaced with a forged
letter from Aristotle to Alexander the Great. The cases of
<em>MXG</em> (corresponding to three separate items in Diogenes&rsquo;
list and two in Hesychius&rsquo;), <em>Mund.</em> (found in
Ptolemy&rsquo;s list and often taken to bear traces of Stoic
influence) and the <em>Constitution of the Athenians</em> (assumed to
be authentic in ancient sources) remain controversial due to a lack of
decisive evidence.</p>

<p>
Other inauthentic works are further removed from the corresponding
original ancient texts. The text of <em>On Things Heard</em>
corresponds to several excerpts of a larger treatise quoted by
Porphyry in his commentary on Ptolemy&rsquo;s <em>Harmonics</em>. The
Greek text of <em>Plant</em>. is a Renaissance Greek translation of a
medieval Latin translation of a 9<sup>th</sup>-century Arabic
translation of a Greek work by Nicolaus of Damascus (dated either to
the 1<sup>st</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> century CE) which could still be
based on Aristotle&rsquo;s lost work. A treatise <em>On Plants</em> is
mentioned in every ancient list of Aristotle&rsquo;s works, it has
been lost since the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias. <em>Vent</em>.
is a fragment of a larger work which is lost.</p>

<p>
<em>Probl.</em> and <em>Mech.</em> are both collections that offer
disjoint treatments of various problems having to do respectively with
natural science and applied mathematics. As similar titles appear in
the ancient lists of Aristotle&rsquo;s works and several
cross-references to &ldquo;problems<em>&rdquo;</em> are found in the
authentic texts, it is possible that parts of the extant
<em>Probl.</em> derive from authentic works. The vast collection of
<em>Probl.</em> has certainly not been put together haphazardly: it
covers a very wide array of issues in which related themes are dealt
with in close proximity, although their treatments are by no means
mutually consistent and sometimes remain explicitly tentative. The
degree of organization still varies greatly across its books, each
dealing with a different topic (e.g. book III: wine), some questions
end up being treated several times, sometimes within the same book and
in inconsistent manners (see e.g. XXXI.12, 13, 18 and 19). At least
part of the text can be shown to derive from works by Aristotle,
Theophrastus or Strato and must therefore have been composed later. It
is likely that the collection does not have a single author and
originated in the Lyceum. <em>Mech.</em> is a much shorter collection
with a preface and a well-defined subject-matter. Some of the main
arguments against its authenticity are the absence of any
cross-reference to <em>Mech.</em> in the authentic works,
terminological and doctrinal discrepancies (especially about the
notion of natural motion), and a reference to a special device, temple
wheels (848a23f.), for which there is no attestation outside of
Hellenistic Egypt.</p>
