<h1>The Psychology of Normative Cognition</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Aug 25, 2020; substantive revision Mon Feb 17, 2025</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
From an early age, humans exhibit a tendency to identify, adopt, and
enforce the norms of their local communities. Norms are the social
rules that mark out what is appropriate, allowed, required, or
forbidden in different situations for various community members. These
rules are informal in the sense that although they are sometimes
represented in formal laws, like the rule governing which side of the
road to drive on, they need not be explicitly codified to effectively
influence behavior. There are rules that forbid theft or the breaking
of promises, but also rules that govern how close it is appropriate to
stand to someone while talking to them, or how loud one should talk
during the conversation. Thus understood, norms regulate a wide range
of activity. They exhibit cultural variability in their prescriptions
and proscriptions, but the presence of norms in general appears to be
culturally universal. Some norms exhibit characteristics that are
often associated with morality, such as a rule that applies to
everyone and prohibits causing unnecessary harm. Other norms apply
only to certain people, such as those that delimit appropriate
clothing for members of different genders, or those concerning the
expectations and responsibilities ascribed to individuals who occupy
positions of leadership. The norms that prevail in a community can be
more or less fair, reasonable, or impartial, and can be subject to
critique and change.</p>

<p>
This entry provides an overview of interdisciplinary research into the
psychology and evolution of norm-guided cognition, motivation, and
behavior. The notions of a norm and normativity occur in an enormous
range of research that spans the humanities and behavioral sciences.
Researchers primarily concerned with the psychology distinctive of
norm-governed behavior take what can be called a
&ldquo;cognitive-evolutionary&rdquo; approach to their subject matter.
This kind of approach, common in the cognitive sciences, draws on a
variety of resources and evidence to investigate different
psychological capacities. This entry describes how these have been
used to construct accounts of those cognitive and motivational
features of minds that underpin the capacity to acquire, conform to,
and enforce norms. It also describes how theories of the selective
pressures and adaptive challenges prominent in recent human evolution
have helped to inform and constrain theorizing about this
psychological capacity, as well as how its features can influence the
transmission and cultural evolution of norms.</p>

<p>
Section I begins by laying out the broad evolutionary perspective
shared by theorists who take a cognitive-evolutionary approach to
normative cognition, and against which many contemporary debates among
them take place. It then goes on to map out several key psychological
dimensions along which contemporary accounts of normative cognition
differ. Section II reviews several areas of contemporary empirical and
theoretical research into normative cognition, including questions
about norms and cultural variability, the role of punishment and
punitive motivations in normative cognition, the ontogeny of normative
cognition, and debates about norm cognition in nonhuman animals.
Section III focuses on the relationship between normative cognition
and moral theory, broadly construed.</p>

<h2 id="CognEvolAppr">1. Cognitive-Evolutionary Approach to Norms</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Norms,&rdquo; as we will use the term in this entry, refer to
the rules of a group of people that mark out what is appropriate,
allowed, required, or forbidden for various members in different
situations. They are typically manifest in common behavioral
regularities that are kept in place by social sanctions and social
pressure. When a person is born into or otherwise enters a community,
they need to be able to identify and extract information about the
broad assortment of norms that shape it, who different norms apply to
and when, and what the consequences of breaking them are. They must be
able to see some behaviors <em>as</em> normatively regulated, and then
to infer what the governing rule is. Learning about norms in these
ways is sometimes guided via explicit mentoring (Sterelny 2012), but
people, especially children, are able to acquire much of the relevant
information and skills without intentional pedagogy (Schmidt, Rakoczy,
&amp; Tomasello 2011). Once a person adopts a norm, it functions both
as a rule that guides behavior and as a standard against which
behavior is evaluated. Individuals often become motivated to enforce
as well as comply with the norms they adopt. Enforcement and
punishment are broad categories, and can include correcting,
communicating disapproval through body language or explicit criticism,
ostracizing or gossiping about norm violators, even threatening or
inflicting physical violence (but see also Westra &amp; Andrews 2022).
Thus, individuals become responsive to norms and the social pressure
by which they are enforced, and motivated to apply social pressure to
others who transgress. In this way, prevalent norms and standards of
conduct are collectively maintained by a community, which in turn help
stabilize the community&rsquo;s social arrangements and the norms that
structure them.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Normative cognition&rdquo; (or &ldquo;norm psychology&rdquo;)
refers to the psychological mechanisms that explain how individuals
learn, comply with, and enforce norms (c.f. Westra &amp; Andrews,
2022; Andrews, Fitzpatrick, and Westra 2024; Heyes 2024). The central
questions driving contemporary debates within the
cognitive-evolutionary approach to norms concern the nature of these
mechanisms: their causal structure, their proper functions, their
neural bases, their ontogeny, and their evolutionary origins. This
section will focus on the broad theoretical and methodological
background of these debates. First, it will situate questions about
normative cognition against the backdrop of contemporary theorizing
about human evolution, especially concerning cooperation and culture.
Then it will lay out key points of theoretical disagreement about the
nature of the psychological mechanisms underlying normative cognition.
But first, a few disclaimers about the scope of the entry as a whole
are in order.</p>

<p>
Importantly, while questions about the nature of norms are relevant to
a range of debates in philosophy (and beyond), contemporary work on
the psychology of norms is not primarily driven by one particular
<em>philosophical</em> tradition or debate. Rather, it is motivated by
a set of general issues concerning human nature: the structure and
distinctive features of human minds, the pathways of human evolution
that produced them, and the commonalities and differences between
human minds and behaviors, on one hand, and those found in non-human
species, on the other (Tomasello 1999; Richerson &amp; Boyd 2005;
Tooby &amp; Cosmides 2005; J. Henrich 2015; Westra, Fitzpatrick, &amp;
Andrews 2024). One upshot of this is that theorists draw on the full
range of explanatory resources made available by contemporary
cognitive science. Thus, these accounts of normative cognition are not
constrained by folk-psychological explanations of behavior, and so are
free to posit and appeal to psychological mechanisms, states, and
processes that need not bear much resemblance to beliefs and desires,
credences and preferences, conscious deliberation and explicit
inference.</p>

<p>
This entry is organized around research whose focal point is the
psychology distinctive of normative cognition. However, <em>any</em>
discussion of norms and norm-guided behavior will involve, tacitly or
otherwise, <em>some</em> picture or other of agents and the
characteristics that make them responsive to normative influence. Some
begin with analytic formalizations of the kinds of agents and mental
states assumed by common sense folk psychology, and use these
formalizations, along with various refinements, to account for
different norm related phenomena. These fall beyond the scope of this
entry, but see especially Bicchieri, Muldoon, and Sontuoso (2023) for
an overview of such approaches (also see Bicchieri 2006, 2016; Brennan
et al. 2013; Conte, Andrighetto, &amp; Campenn&igrave; 2013; Hawkins,
Goodman, &amp; Goldstone 2019; cf. Morris et al. 2015). It is also
worth noting that the cognitive-evolutionary approach is sometimes
presented as importantly different from classic rational choice
approaches to human decision and social behavior (Boyd &amp; Richerson
2001; Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Whether these are genuinely
distinct alternatives remains unclear (Elster 1991, cf. Wendel 2001),
but those who make the case typically point to a growing body of
evidence that suggests humans rarely approximate the unboundedly
rational, purely self-interested agents of classical economics
(Gigerenzer &amp; Selten 2001; Kahneman 2011, cf. Millgram 2021. To
illustrate, participants in one-time, anonymous cooperation games have
been observed to routinely cooperate, even when they are made
explicitly aware of their anonymity and the fact that they will play
the game just once (Marwell &amp; Ames 1981; see Thaler 1992 for a
review). Those sympathetic to the cognitive-evolutionary approach to
norms have an explanatory template for this kind of finding ready at
hand, and will explain participants&rsquo; behavior by appeal to their
norm psychology and the pro-social norms that they have
internalized.</p>

<p>
Finally, norms are often classified into kinds or subcategories, with
common examples including moral, social, conventional, epistemic,
aesthetic, and organizational norms. The correct or theoretically most
useful way to taxonomize kinds of norms is the subject of much debate,
but one that will be set aside here (see O&rsquo;Neill 2017 for a
review and Kelly (2022) for discussion). Rather, this section will
sketch a general overview of the conceptual space common to
cognitive-evolutionary work on the psychology of norms. Later sections
will provide elaboration where it will help to locate different
theories within that conceptual space and identify their
distinguishing commitments.</p>

<h3 id="NormCognHuma">1.1 Normative Cognition and Human Evolution</h3>

<p>
A hypothesis influential among those who take a cognitive-evolutionary
approach is that the psychological mechanisms underlying norm
psychology are evolved adaptations to important selection pressures in
human evolutionary history (Richerson &amp; Boyd 2005; Sripada &amp;
Stich 2007, Tomasello 2009; Chudek &amp; Henrich 2011; Kelly &amp;
Davis 2018, cf. Cosmides &amp; Tooby 1992; Heyes 2024).</p>

<p>
It is widely agreed that humans are extraordinarily social animals,
and that our hypertrophied abilities to learn from and cooperate with
each other are key to what set us apart from our closest primate
ancestors and other hominid species. A crucial difference is thought
to be that human capacities to imitate and learn from each other
became powerful enough to sustain <em>cumulative culture</em>
(Tomasello 1999; J. Henrich &amp; McElreath 2003, Laland 2017).
Culture is understood as information that is transmitted between
individuals and groups via behavior, rather than processes like
genetic transmission (Ramsey 2013). Beliefs, preferences, norms,
skills, techniques, information-containing artifacts, etc., are passed
from individual to individual, and thus across populations and between
generations, mainly by <em>social learning</em> (Mathew &amp;
Perreault 2015). For example, development of the set of techniques and
skills associated with throwing spears, or the knowledge and tools
enabling the controlled use of fire, have been tied to increases in
opportunities for social learning provided by expanding social
networks and more complex forms of social activity (Thieme 1997;
Gowlett 2006). Culture is <em>cumulative</em> in the sense that the
body of information in the cultural repository does not remain static,
but can itself grow larger and more complex. Grass huts evolve into
wood-frame houses, then brick buildings, and eventually skyscrapers.
Tribal leaders evolve into kings, then emperors, then prime ministers.
Simple sets of norms evolve into more complicated informal
institutions, then byzantine formalized legal codes. As each
generation adds its own new innovations, discoveries, and
improvements, functional sophistication is accumulated in cultural
traits in much the same way as it is accumulated in genetic
traits.</p>

<p>
This general evolutionary outlook gives reason to think that as human
groups increased in size, they also grew in their capacity to carry
more culture and produce more cultural innovations (Kline &amp; Boyd
2010; J. Henrich 2015: chapter 12), though the causal relationship
between population size and cultural complexity remains controversial
(Fogarty &amp; Creanza 2017, cf. Vaesen et al. 2016). As cultural
innovations continued to accumulate, they allowed humans to more
significantly control and reshape the environments in which they
lived. Such transformations also reshaped the environments inhabited
by subsequent generations, thus shifting the contours of the physical,
social, and informational niches in which they evolved. Such changes,
in turn, created a range of new selection pressures, many of which
favored bodies, brains, and minds better equipped for sociality and
cultural inheritance. Researchers continue to develop and debate the
merits of different conceptual tools with which to conceive of this
kind of evolutionary dynamic (Tomasello 1999; Laland, Odling-Smee,
&amp; Feldman 2001; Laland, Odling-Smee, &amp; Myles 2010; Sterelny
2003, 2012; Richerson &amp; Boyd 2005; Tennie, Call, &amp; Tomasello
2009; Boyd, Richerson, &amp; Henrich 2011, J. Henrich 2015; Boyd
2017).</p>

<p>
Humans are able to inhabit a wide range of environments, and socially
transmitted information&mdash;as opposed to innately specified and
biologically transmitted information&mdash;is particularly useful in
the face of ecological and social variation (Richerson &amp; Boyd
2013). Information about which plants in various environments are
edible and which are toxic has straightforward adaptive advantage.
Information about what kinds of norms prevail in various social
environments is also important, and knowing it allows individuals to
smoothly participate in their community and coordinate with other
members in an array of collective activities that ranges from
producing food and raising children to responding to threats and
dealing with outsiders (Chudek &amp; Henrich 2011). While different
types of <em>cultural variants</em> can be useful in different ways,
not all socially transmittable information is equally valuable, and
individuals are not indiscriminate social learners. Theorists posit
that human minds evolved to contain a number of social learning
<em>biases</em> or <em>heuristics</em> that help facilitate more
selective learning. These influence which, of the many cultural
variants to which an individual is exposed, she will actually adopt
for herself. Two heuristics appear to be particularly important in
amplifying the advantages of a system of cultural inheritance. One is
a <em>conformity</em> bias, which prompts individuals to adopt those
cultural variants that have been adopted by most others in their
community (Muthukrishna, Morgan, &amp; Henrich 2016), and another is a
<em>prestige</em> bias, which sensitizes individuals to hierarchy and
status, prompting them to model their behavior on those who have
achieved success and high social rank (J. Henrich &amp; Gil-White
2001; Cheng et al. 2012; Maner 2017). In addition to these two,
researchers have posited other learning biases that can influence norm
acquisition, including one that makes information about norms easier
to remember than other, non-normative information about behavior
(O&rsquo;Gorman, Wilson, &amp; Miller 2008).</p>

<p>
Culture looms increasingly large in evolutionary explanations of human
ultrasociality, i.e., our species&rsquo; ability to cooperate on a
remarkably large scale (Tomasello 2009, 2016; Richerson 2013; though
see Hagen &amp; Hammerstein 2006; Burnham &amp; Johnson 2005 for
alternative views, and Sterelny, Calcott, &amp; Fraser 2013 for
broader context on the evolution of cooperation). An increasingly
prominent idea is that explaining the full range of behaviors involved
in human sociality will require some appeal not just to culture in
general, but to culturally transmitted norms and institutions in
particular (Mathew, Boyd, &amp; van Veelen 2013). Some have taken the
significance and complexity of the adaptive challenges posed by
large-scale cooperation to have implications for human psychology,
arguing from these grounds that human minds have a capacity specific
to norms (Chudek, Zhao, &amp; Henrich 2013), which may have evolved in
tandem with our capacities for language (Lamm 2014). Others argue
further that cultural group selection, generated by various forms of
competition between cultural groups like communities, tribes, clans,
and even nations, has contributed to the spread of more effective
cooperative norms (Turchin 2018; Richerson, Baldini, et al. 2016,
though see Krasnow et al. 2015). Still others agree that culture and
social learning are central to the evolution of normative cognition,
but argue that core elements of normative cognition first evolved as
an adaptation for transmitting complex craft and motor skills, such as
those required for toolmaking (Birch, 2021).</p>

<p>
On these views, culture-driven selective pressures further remodeled
human social psychology, supplementing more evolutionarily ancient
social instincts to form what have been called tribal social instincts
(Richerson &amp; Boyd 2001; Boyd &amp; Richerson 2008; Richerson &amp;
Henrich 2012). This family of evolutionarily recent
&ldquo;instincts&rdquo; is posited as including a capacity for norms,
but also other psychological features thought to refine norm-guided
behavior in various ways, including sensitivities to markers of tribal
membership and the boundaries between ethnic groups (McElreath, Boyd,

<h3 id="ArchNormCogn">1.2 The Architecture of Normative Cognition</h3>

<p>
The theoretical toolkit common in the cognitive and behavioral
sciences affords theorists several dimensions along which they can
stake out and explore more specific views about human normative
psychology. The following list of such dimensions is not exhaustive,
but it gives a sense of some of the most significant ones. The
psychological mechanisms posited by different accounts of normative
cognition can differ with respect to</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>Whether and to what extent they are fast, automatic, intuitive,
non-conscious, or otherwise fit the description of &ldquo;type
1&rdquo; cognition, or are slow, controlled, effortful, conscious, or
otherwise fit the description of &ldquo;type 2&rdquo; cognition</li>

<li>Whether and to what extent they use proprietary mental
representations to store information about norms, and if so the format
and content of those mental representations</li>

<li>Whether and to what extent they are the product of innate,
domain-specific adaptations or of domain general processes</li>

<li>Whether and to what extent the motivation associated with the
mechanisms is intrinsic or instrumental</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first dimension concerns a distinction between <em>type 1</em> and
<em>type 2</em> cognitive processes made by dual processing and dual
systems theories (see Frankish 2010 for a review, Cushman, Young,
&amp; Greene 2010). Type 1 processes are typically characterized as
&ldquo;fast and frugal,&rdquo; intuitive, heuristic processes which
deliver &ldquo;rough-and-ready&rdquo; responses (Gigerenzer et al.
2000). These processes are automatic, unconscious, and prone to error,
but they make up in speed and resource-efficiency what they lack in
precision. Type 2 processes, by contrast, are typically characterized
as slower, rule-based, analytical processes which require more
concentration and cognitive effort, take place consciously, and
deliver more precise responses. The mechanisms of normative cognition
appear to cross-cut this distinction. There is considerable evidence
that normative cognitive operates in an intuitive and implicit manner,
shaping our social motivations and thinking in ways that we hardly
notice (Reber &amp; Norenzayan, 2018; Bear et al. 2020; Kalkstein et
al. 2022). However, we also clearly have the capacity to explicitly
represent, reason about, teach, and question the norms around us
(Kelly, 2022; Heyes, 2024). Thus, one important challenge for theories
of normative cognition is to explain how implicit, Type 1 and
explicit, Type 2 processes each contribute to normative behavior.</p>

<p>
Commitments about whether normative cognition is supported by Type 1
or Type 2 processes could support different views about the extent to
which normatively governed expectations and behavior require or are
susceptible to voluntary control. If the processes subserving the
capacity for norms are to some degree automatic and unconscious, and
are insensitive to changes a person makes to her explicit beliefs,
judgments, or volitions, those processes would be able to affect her
behavior without the need of any guidance from her will, and could
help produce behaviors and judgments that oppose it. Research on
implicit bias may provide useful resources for thinking about the
relationship between normative cognition and voluntary control. Recent
work sheds light on what kind of intervention strategies are effective
(Lai et al. 2014; Devine et al. 2012; Mack 2024), and suggests that
deliberate cognitive effort and voluntary control can, under certain
conditions, override the influence of implicit and automatic
cognition. Turning to normative cognition, research suggests that
self-control may be required to violate a norm one has internalized,
such as the norm against breaking promises (Baumgartner et al. 2009),
but the details remain unclear (Peach, Yoshida, &amp; Zanna 2011;
Yoshida et al. 2012; also see Kelly (2022a) for discussion of
differences between internalized and avowed norms).</p>

<p>
The second dimension concerns the extent to which normative cognition
involves explicit representations of rules. Norms are often
characterized in terms of rules (including in this entry), but it is
not always clear what this implies about the psychological processes
that lead us to comply with and enforce them. One possibility is that
our norm psychology stores information about local norms as
sentence-like representations in the head (i.e. imperative as opposed
to declarative or interrogative sentences). One advantage of positing
such sentential representations is that they appear able to explain
the specificity that characterize many norms. However, this
possibility raises difficult questions about the format of these
sentence-like representations (Heyes 2024). If normative rules are
<em>exclusively</em> represented as sentences in natural languages
like English, this would have potentially radical implications about
the evolution and development of norm psychology. It would seem to
imply, for example, that language evolved before normative cognition,
and that non-linguistic creatures such as infants and nonhuman animals
lack the capacity for norms. It would also render various
&ldquo;implicit&rdquo; aspects of norm psychology somewhat mysterious.
Sentence-like representations of norms would fit well within a
language of thought framework (Fodor 1975, Rescorla 2019, Quilty-Dunn
et al 2023), but this framework remains controversial. Other
researchers have posited several alternative ways of making sense of
normative cognition that do not require explicit, rule-based
representations. Birch (2021), for example, has suggested that
norm-guided behavior is governed by causally structured, model-based
representations whose primary function is to guide skilled action.
Colombo (2014) has proposed that norms are implicitly represented by
reinforcement learning systems through stored maps of the reward
structures of different environments. Westra and Andrews (2022)
suggest that some norms may not be represented in individual minds at
all, but are simply the emergent products of recurrent patterns of
social interaction. They endorse a pluralistic approach to norm
psychology that can accommodate the possibility that some instances of
normative behavior involve explicit, sentential representations of
rules, while other instances involve non-linguistic model-based
representations, while still others do not involve any explicit
representations at all.</p>

<p>
The third dimension concerns the extent to which the mechanisms that
support normative cognition are innate and domain-specific:
specialized for dealing with certain kinds of problems, responding to
distinctive kinds of cues, and processing specific types of
information (similar to innate perceptual mechanisms for e.g.
detecting faces and biological motion). In contrast are views that see
norm psychology as supported mostly by general-purpose cognition,
processes like classical conditioning or statistical learning that
handle relatively unrestricted kinds of information and contribute to
solving a wide range of problems. Notably, researchers have invoked
notions of domain-specificity and domain-generality in many different
ways across the cognitive sciences (see Laurence &amp; Margolis 2023),
and the range of theoretical options recently developed by those
working on normative cognition is impressive.</p>

<p>
For example, several theorists have sought to develop an analogy
between Chomskyan theories of language acquisition and use, on one
hand, and the acquisition and application of (what they call) moral
rules, on the other (Mikhail 2007, 2011; Dwyer, Huebner, &amp; Hauser
2010; Hauser, Young, &amp; Cushman 2008; Roedder &amp; Harman 2010;
see section 3.1 below for more debates over which rules and norms
might count as moral, and over the scope of &ldquo;moral&rdquo; more
generally). This approach posits a universal psychological competence
that guides learning specifically in the domain of morality, and
contains enough innately specified structure to account for the
putative poverty of stimulus that children face when attempting to
learn the norms that prevail in their local environment (see Laurence
&amp; Margolis 2001 for discussion of poverty of the stimulus
arguments in cognitive science). Some advocates also suggest that in
addition to information specifying the structure of the mechanisms
dedicated to acquiring and processing these rules, a few particular
norms themselves may also be included as part of this innate capacity,
perhaps norms against incest or intentionally causing harm (e.g.,
Mikhail 2007, 2011). For direct criticisms of this approach, see Prinz
(2008) and Sterelny (2012).</p>

<p>
Another prominent kind of view posits the existence of a specialized
<em>norm system</em>&ndash;an integrated suite of cognitive mechanisms
dedicated to learning, storing, complying with, and enforcing norms as
such (e.g., Sripada &amp; Stich, 2006, described in detail below).
Others who have developed this idea emphasize the ways in which norm
psychology appears to be more of a <em>kludge</em> (see Marcus 2007)
made up of many distinguishable, domain-specific subsystems. These
evolved piecemeal and independently, each to solve its own specific
adaptive problem (e.g., challenges related to selective social
learning, cooperation, parasite avoidance, etc.) but in normative
cognition have come to exhibit a significant degree of functional
integration and operational cohesion (Kelly &amp; Davis 2018, Kelly
2020, also see Richerson &amp; Boyd 2001, Stich 2006).</p>

<p>
Others have explored the potential of domain-general processes to
explain aspects of norm psychology, arguing that they are better able
to account for many of its aspects, including how norms are learned
(e.g., by detecting statistical regularities in the behaviors of
ingroup members (Nichols et al 2016; Gaus &amp; Nichols 2017; Ayars
&amp; Nichols 2017, 2019; Nichols, 2021; Roberts, 2022; Partington,
Nichols, &amp; Kushnir 2023)), as well as the motivation to comply and
enforce them (e.g., by pointing to affective costs of the disfluency
that comes from norm deviations (Birch 2021, Theriault, Young, &amp;
Barrett, 2021)). Meanwhile, proponents of pluralistic approaches have
argued that normative cognition is supported by a highly heterogeneous
mix of domain-general and domain-specific processes, and which ones
are involved in any given episode of norm-relevant behavior is likely
to vary from one to the next (Westra &amp; Andrews, 2022).</p>

<p>
Celia Heyes has deployed her general <em>cognitive gadgets</em>
framework (see Heyes 2018) to develop an account that similarly
depicts norm psychology as involving a mix of the domain specific and
the domain general (c.f. D&rsquo;Souza and Karmiloff-Smith, 2011).
Cognitive gadgets are bundles of integrated psychological mechanisms
and routinized processes that support domain specific skills, such as
reading and writing, playing chess, and driving. These bundles of
mechanisms, however, are neither innate nor the product of genetic
evolution by natural selection. Rather, cognitive gadgets are
fashioned and bundled together by cultural evolution. Once a
particular gadget emerges in a group&rsquo;s cultural repertoire,
members can possess it, i.e. acquire the bundle of psychological
mechanisms itself (rather than merely the content they process.)
Crucially, on Heyes&rsquo; view, the learning processes involved in
acquiring a cognitive gadget are domain <em>general</em> (Heyes 2018).
Applying this framework to norm psychology, Heyes (2024) argues that
human normative behavior is initially supported in childhood by
implicit, domain-general forms of cognition and cultural learning, but
that it typically comes to be supplemented with a domain-specific
&ldquo;gadget&rdquo; that supports explicit, rule-based thought and
communication about what is permissible, impermissible, and
appropriate (see Kelly 2024 for more discussion).</p>

<p>
The fourth and final dimension concerns motivation. Especially in
light of the roles that punishment and reward play in the
stabilization of group-level patterns of behavior (Sripada 2005), an
initially plausible idea is that normative motivation is
<em>instrumental</em> (for discussion see Fehr &amp; Falk 2002). On
such views, an individual conforms to a norm in order to receive some
benefit, or to avoid reprimand, or because she wants to behave in the
way she thinks others expect her to behave. Such motivation would be
instrumental in the sense that people obey norms merely as a means to
some further end that more fundamentally drives them; in
counterfactual terms, if the external reward, punishment, or social
expectation is removed, and the individual&rsquo;s norm compliant
behavior will disappear along with it. Those who explore this kind of
account have recently emphasized the role of psychological states like
conditional preferences, together with 2<sup>nd</sup> order social
beliefs, i.e., people&rsquo;s beliefs about other people&rsquo;s
expectations, and people&rsquo;s beliefs about other people&rsquo;s
beliefs about what should be done (see Bicchieri, Muldoon, &amp;
Sontuoso 2023 for discussion of such a family views).</p>

<p>
Other accounts construe normative motivation as <em>intrinsic</em>
(Kelly &amp; Davis 2018; Nichols (2021), especially chapter 10). On
such a view, once a norm is acquired and internalized, it typically
becomes infused with some kind of non-instrumental motivation. People
will be motivated to comply with and enforce a such rule for its own
sake, and experience an impetus to do so that is independent of
external circumstances or the perceived likelihood that they will
receive social sanctions if they flout the norm. Intrinsic motivation,
however does not imply unconditional behavioral conformity. For
example, a person may feel the intrinsic pull of a norm that
prescribes leaving a 20% tip, but still choose to override it and
instead act out of material self-interest, stiffing the waiter. This
second family of accounts raises a broader set of questions about the
psychological nature of normative motivation, and if and how it might
be special. Is normative motivation best treated as a primitive, its
own <em>sui generis</em> psychological category? Or is it better
construed as being generated by more familiar psychological elements
like desires, emotions, drives, or other types of conative states,
posited on independent grounds, that are recruited to work in
conjunction with normative psychology? (see Kelly 2020 for
discussion)</p>

<p>
An early and influential account of norm psychology given by Sripada
and Stich (2007) illustrates how these kinds of theoretical pieces
might be put together. The preliminary model posits two innate
mechanisms, a <em>norm acquisition mechanism</em> and a <em>norm
execution mechanism.</em> The functions or tasks of the norm
acquisition mechanism are</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>to <em>identify behavioral cues</em> indicating the existence of a
norm</li>

<li>to <em>infer the content</em> of that norm, and finally</li>

<li>to <em>pass information</em> about that content on to a norm
execution mechanism</li>
</ol>

<p>
The tasks of the norm execution mechanism, on the other hand, are</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>to <em>encode</em> and <em>store</em> those norms passed along to
it by the acquisition system in a <em>norm database</em>, which may
have some proprietary processes for reasoning about the contents
represented therein</li>

<li>to <em>detect</em> cues in the immediate environment that indicate
if any of those norms apply to the situation, and if so to whom</li>

<li>to generate motivation to <em>comply</em> with those norms that
apply to oneself,</li>

<li>to generate motivation to <em>punish</em> those who violate norms
that apply to them</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sripada and Stich provide an initial pictorial representation:</p>

<div class="figure" id="figure1">
<img src="drawing-plain.svg" alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure:</span> Sripada &amp; Stich 2007: 290,
figure redrawn. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#figure1">extended description of the figure</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The acquisition and execution mechanisms themselves are posited as
innate, but are highly sensitive to the local social setting in which
an individual develops. On this account, this bifurcation into innate
psychological architecture, on the one hand, and socially learned
normative content, on the other, helps to explain why the presence of
norms is culturally universal, whereas the behaviors, roles, and
social arrangements governed by those norms exhibit variation. In
addition, the model depicts the operation of many components of the
norm system as &ldquo;automatic and involuntary&rdquo; (Sripada &amp;
Stich 2007: 290), but takes no stand on particular processes or more
granular characteristics associated with dual processing. Finally, the
model is designed to accommodate evidence suggesting that when a norm
is acquired and represented in the database it thereby gains a
distinctive kind of motivational profile. Specifically, this profile
construes normative motivation as</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>intrinsically as opposed to instrumentally motivating</li>

<li>both self- and other-oriented</li>

<li>potentially powerful</li>
</ol>

<p>
On this account, normative motivation has the third property in the
sense that in some cases it is capable of overpowering even fairly
compelling motivations that pull in conflicting directions; extreme
examples include suicide bombers overriding their instincts for
self-preservation, or other fanatics who expend significant resources
to enforce their favored norms on others. The self- and
other-directedness of normative motivation captures the idea that the
norm system produces motivation to keep one&rsquo;s own behavior in
compliance with a norm as well as motivation to enforce it by
punishing others who violate it.</p>

<p>
Finally, the model depicts normative motivation as intrinsic in the
usual sense that people comply with norms as ultimate ends, or for
their own sake. Sripada and Stich suggest that intrinsic motivation
helps explain a property of norms they call &ldquo;independent
normativity&rdquo;. This marks the fact that norms can exert reliable
influence on people&rsquo;s behavior even when those norms are not
written down or formally articulated in any formal institution, and
thus not enforced via any official mechanisms of punishment and reward
(also see Davidson &amp; Kelly 2020). They also discuss motivation and
independent normativity in terms of an &ldquo;internalization
hypothesis&rdquo; drawn from sociology and anthropology, and suggest
that the idea of internalization can be interpreted in terms of their
model. On this story, a person has internalized a norm when it has
been acquired by and represented in her norm database. The
internalization hypothesis can then be construed as a claim that
internalized norms are intrinsically motivating for the simple reason
that it is a fundamental psychological feature of normative cognition
that once a norm has been acquired, delivered to, and represented in a
person&rsquo;s norm database, the norm system automatically confers
this distinctive motivational profile on the norm. Being accompanied
by self- and other-directed intrinsic motivation is part of the
functional role a rule comes to occupy once it is represented in the
database of a person&rsquo;s norm system&mdash;when it is
&ldquo;internalized&rdquo;&mdash;in something analogous to the way
that being accompanied by avoidance motivation and contamination
sensitivity is part of the functional role a cue comes to occupy once
it is represented in a person&rsquo;s disgust system (Kelly 2011; also
see Gavrilets &amp; Richerson 2017 for a computational model exploring
the evolution of norm internalization and the kinds of selective
forces that may have given normative psychology this intriguing
characteristic).</p>

<h2 id="ContDeba">2. Contemporary Debates</h2>

<p>
This section reviews several areas of ongoing study about normative
cognition and debate within the cognitive-evolutionary tradition.
These focus on questions about cultural variability, about the
ontogeny, about whether elements of normative cognition are present in
nonhuman animals, and an ongoing debate about the centrality of
third-party punishment to normative cognition.</p>

<h3 id="NormCultVari">2.1 Norms and Cultural Variability</h3>

<p>
The ethnographic record indicates that all cultures are structured by
norms&mdash;rules that guide behavior and standards by which it is
evaluated (Brown 1991). Evidence also suggests that norms are fairly
evolutionarily ancient, as there is little indication that the
capacity for norms spread from society to society in the recent past.
Anthropologists also have shown that norms governing, e.g., food
sharing, marriage practices, kinship networks, communal rituals, etc.,
regulate the practices of extant hunter-gatherers and relatively
culturally isolated groups, which would be unlikely if norms were a
recent innovation (see J. Henrich 2015 for a review). Much attention,
however, has been given to the ways in which the prevailing sets of
norms vary between cultures (House, Kanngiesser, et al. 2020; cf.
Hofstede 1980, 2001) and the manner in which packages of norms develop
and change over time within particular cultures (Gaus 2016, Schulz et
al. 2019; cf. Inglehart 1997; Bednar et al. 2010).</p>

<p>
For example, one line of evidence from comparative ethnography looks
at cooperative behavior, and reveals variation between groups even in
the kinds of activities, relationships, and contexts that are governed
by norms. Some groups &ldquo;cooperate only in warfare and fishing,
while others, just downstream, cooperate only in housebuilding and
communal rituals&rdquo; (Chudek, Zhao, &amp; Henrich 2013: 426). That
behavioral variations like these can persist even in the face of the
same ecological context (i.e., &ldquo;just downstream&rdquo;) suggests
that they are due to differences in norms and other socially
transmitted elements of culture, rather than responses more directly
evoked by the physical environment (also see N. Henrich &amp; J.
Henrich 2007).</p>

<p>
It is a platitude that different individual norms, identified by their
scope, content, and the specific behaviors they prescribe and
proscribe, are present in different cultures. Systematic empirical
work has also recently investigated the prominence of different
normative <em>themes</em> across cultures. Familiar examples include
the different families of norms that mark cultures of honor versus
cultures of shame, especially those that that govern violence and its
aftermath (Nisbett &amp; Cohen 1996; Uskal et al. 2019), or the
different kinds of norms found in societies that prize individualistic
values versus those dominated by more collectivist ones, especially
norms that delimit the scope of personal choice (McAuliffe et al.
2003; Nisbett 2004; Ross 2012, Hagger Rentzelas, &amp; Chatzisarantis
2014; J. Henrich 2020, also see J. Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan
2010 for discussion of methodological issues). Other researchers have
distinguished still other themes, for instance identifying the kinds
of values and &ldquo;purity&rdquo; norms that predominate in a
community governed by what they call an ethics of divinity, in
comparison to those prevalent in communities that are governed by an
ethics of autonomy or an ethics of community (Shweder et al. 1997;
Rozin et al. 1999; this line of thought has been further developed in
the influential Moral Foundations Theory, Haidt 2012; Graham et al.
2013). Theorists also use these kinds of empirical findings to help
assess claims about norm psychology, shedding light on those features
of individual normative cognition that are more rigid and universal
versus those that are more culturally malleable, and on how such
psychological features might make various patterns of group-level
variation more or less likely (O&rsquo;Neill &amp; Machery 2018).</p>

<p>
A more recent contribution along these lines is Gelfand and
colleagues&rsquo; investigation of patterns in the <em>tightness</em>
and <em>looseness</em> of different cultures&rsquo; norms. This work
looks at differences in the general overall &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of
norms within and across cultures: how many norms there are, how
tolerant of deviations from normatively prescribed behavior members of
a culture tend to be, and how severely they punish violations
(Gelfand, Nishii, &amp; Raver 2006; Gelfand, Raver, et al. 2011;
Gelfand, Harrington, &amp; Jackson 2017). Tighter cultures have more
numerous and exacting standards, with members who are less tolerant of
slight deviancies and prone to impose more severe sanctions. Cultures
whose members are more lenient and accepting of wiggle room around a
norm, and who are less extreme in their enforcement, fall more towards
the loose end of this spectrum. Gelfand and colleagues explore the
manifestations of tightness and looseness not just at the level of
cultures but also across a number of other levels of description, from
the communal and historical down to the behavioral, cognitive, and
neural (Gelfand 2018). A central claim of this account is that a
culture&rsquo;s orientation towards norms&mdash;whether the norm
psychologies of its members tend to be calibrated more tightly or more
loosely&mdash;reflects the severity of the challenges faced in its
past and present:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he evolution of norm strength is <em>adaptive</em> to features of
ecological environments and, in turn, is afforded by a suite of
adaptive psychological processes. (Gelfand, Harrington, &amp; Jackson
2017: 802, our italics)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A group whose ecology is characterized by things like frequent natural
disasters, disease, territorial invasion, or resource scarcity is
likely to possess a more comprehensive and demanding system of norms
and to take a stricter stance towards its norms, in part because more
efficiently coordinated social action is required to overcome more
severe threats. Groups faced with less extreme ecological stressors
have less dire need for tightly coordinated social action, and so can
afford to have weaker norms and more tolerance for deviation.</p>

<p>
Another recent innovation in the study of cross-cultural variation in
norms focuses on a construct known as <em>kinship intensity</em>
(Schulz et al. 2019). Kinship institutions are composed of norms
governing marriage, inheritance, familial obligations, and tribal or
clan-based identities. There is considerable variation in the strength
and centrality of kinship institutions relative to the overall
structure of different cultural groups, and those differences have
been hypothesized to reflect a variety of geographical, environmental,
and contingent historical factors. For example, many modern hunter
gatherer groups favor &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; kinship institutions
supported by strong norms that <em>prohibit</em> marriage among close
kin. These norms limit genetic interrelatedness within smaller, more
local units of social organization and help create loose but sprawling
networks that can be drawn upon for support in times of need (also see
Walker 2014). Contrasted with these are more kinship
&ldquo;intensive&rdquo; institutions, believed to have spread with the
advent of agricultural food production around 12,000 years ago when
cultural evolution began to <em>favor</em> norms prescribing cousin
marriage. These norms, in turn, strengthened kinship bonds between
neighboring families (Bowles &amp; Choi 2013), leading to larger
clan-like institutions that became denser and more interdependent.
These features enabled communities to better organize themselves for
collective activities like defending territory and producing goods
(Sterelny 2021). Groups whose institutions were high in kinship
intensity were inclined to adopt a range of other kinds of norms as
well, including those favoring in-group loyalty, reciprocity,
conformity, deference to authority, and nepotism.</p>

<p>
Building on this package of ideas, Joseph Henrich and his
collaborators have argued that the rise of the Roman Catholic Church
in different parts of the world&ndash;with its strict bans on cousin
marriage, polygamy, concubinage, and legal adoption, as well as its
encouragement of marriages that were monogamous and initiated by
individual choice rather than family arrangement&ndash;systematically
undermined many of the traditional norms and kin-based institutions
that preceded it (Schulz et al. 2019; Henrich 2020). In their place,
new political, economic, religious, and legal institutions emerged, as
well as new norms governing interpersonal social interactions. In the
absence of the rich range of kinship ties that once guided
interpersonal relationships and commerce, these new norms provided
standards based on values like individual autonomy, freedom of
association, impartiality, universalism, and impersonal prosociality.
Henrich and colleagues argue that this new set of norms and
institutions would come to form the basis of a distinctively WEIRD
psychology. Their measures of kinship intensity indicate that it
correlates in suggestive ways with a number of other well-known
indices of cultural variability, including cultural tightness and
looseness, performance on Asch conformity tasks, and individualism and
collectivism.</p>

<h3 id="OntoNormCogn">2.2 The Ontogeny of Normative Cognition</h3>

<p>
An impressive range of evidence suggests that humans are natural-born
norm learners (Schmidt &amp; Rakoczy 2023). The developmental
trajectory of normative cognition in humans appears to exhibit robust
similarities across cultures, with children beginning to participate
in normative behavior around the same early age (see House et al. 2013
and Tomasello 2019a for context). Between three and five years of age
children exhibit knowledge of different kinds of normative rules
(Turiel 1983; Smetana 1993; Nucci 2001), and at as early as three
years of age they are able to perform competently in deontic reasoning
tasks (R. Cummins 1996; Beller 2010). They also enforce norms, both
when they believe the transgressive behavior was freely chosen
(Josephs et al. 2016) but also when they understand that it was
unintentional (Samland et al. 2016) at least in some circumstances
(cf. Chernyak &amp; Sobel 2016; also see Barrett et al. 2016 and
Curtin et al. 2020 for evidence and discussion of cross cultural
variation in people&rsquo;s sensitivity to the mental states of norm
violators). Developmentally, norm enforcement behavior at 2.5 years of
age is predicted by children&rsquo;s understanding of normative
language at 1.5 years of age (Essler and Pauls 2023). Moreover,
children are alert to how other people respond to transgressions,
showing more positive feelings towards those who enforce a norm
violation than toward those who leave violations uncorrected (Vaish et
al. 2016).</p>

<p>
Perhaps most striking is the ease and rapidity with which children
acquire norms. Preschoolers have been found to learn norms quickly
(Rakoczy, Warneken, &amp; Tomasello 2008), even without explicit
instruction (Schmidt, Rakoczy, &amp; Tomasello 2011), although
learning is facilitated when norms are modeled by adults (Rakoczy,
Haman, et al. 2010). Children&rsquo;s enthusiasm for rules&mdash;their
&ldquo;promiscuous normativity&rdquo; (Schmidt, Butler, et al.
2016)&mdash;even appears to outstrip being sensitive to common
norm-governed behavior in their social environment. Evidence suggests
that sometimes a single observation of an action is sufficient for
children to infer the existence of a norm, and that left to their own
devices they will spontaneously create their own norms and teach them
to others (G&ouml;ckeritz, Schmidt, &amp; Tomasello 2014).</p>

<p>
That said, behaviors that are perceived to be statistically normal in
a community are particularly salient to individuals&rsquo; norm
psychology, which is liable to infer that a behavior is correct from
the mere fact that it appears common. Another facet of
children&rsquo;s normative promiscuity is that they are prone to false
positives in the course of acquisition, seeing behavior as norm-guided
even when it is merely usual, and inferring the presence of normative
rules when there are none. One series of studies found that when
participants (children and adults from both the United States and
China) detected or were told that a type of behavior was common among
a group of people, they came to negatively evaluate group members who
behaved in a non-conforming way (Roberts et al. 2018; Roberts, Ho,
&amp; Gelman 2019). Perceptions of what types of behaviors are normal
can also be drastically distorted by social media, which influences
users&rsquo; perception of norms (Brady and Crockett 2024, Robertson
et al 2024). Researchers have investigated this feature of norm
acquisition from different angles, and have labeled it with various
names, including the &ldquo;descriptive-to-prescriptive
tendency&rdquo; (Roberts, Gelman, &amp; Ho 2017), the &ldquo;common is
moral heuristic&rdquo; (Lindstr&ouml;m et al. 2017), and the
&ldquo;injunctive inference hypothesis&rdquo; (Davis, Hennes, &amp;
Raymond 2018, discussing, e.g., Schultz et al. 2007). Since the
evidence suggests that human normative cognition invites an easy
inference from the &ldquo;is&rdquo; of an observed pattern of common
behavior to the &ldquo;ought&rdquo; of a norm (Tworek &amp; Cimpian
2016), philosophers may be tempted to think of this as a
&ldquo;naturalistic fallacy bias&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Another line of research suggests that key to understanding the roots
of normative cognition is the fact that human children are
<em>overimitators</em>. They are not just spontaneous, intuitive, and
excellent imitators, but they also tend to copy <em>all</em> of the
elements in the sequence of a model&rsquo;s behavior, even when they
recognize some of those elements are superfluous to the task at hand
(Lyons, Young, &amp; Keil 2007; Kenward, Karlsson, &amp; Persson 2011;
Keupp, Behne, &amp; Rakoczy 2013; Nielsen, Kapit&aacute;ny, &amp;
Elkins 2014, cf. Heyes 2018: chapter 6). Children attend to the
specific manner in which an action is carried out rather than merely
to the goal it is aimed at, and conform to the full script even if
they see that the goal can be achieved in some more direct way.
Moreover, children monitor others to see if they are doing likewise,
and enforce overimitation on their peers by criticizing those who fail
to perform the entire sequence of steps (Kenward 2012; Rakoczy &amp;
Schmidt 2013). Overimitation can lead to the unnecessary expenditure
of energy on these extraneous behaviors, but the trait may be an
adaptation nevertheless. According to this argument, the costs of what
look like individual &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; are ultimately outweighed
by the communal benefits generated by a population whose individual
capacities for transmitting norms and other cultural variants are more
insistent in this way, erring on the side of too much imitation rather
than too little (J. Henrich 2015: chapter 7). Researchers have also
suggested that whatever it was initially selected for, the
psychological machinery responsible for overimitation makes important
contributions to normative cognition. Evidence indicates that this
machinery generates strong (perhaps intrinsic) social motivation aimed
at behavioral conformity with others. When working in conjunction with
a person&rsquo;s norm psychology, this source of motivation may also
help facilitate performance of the key task of keeping an
individual&rsquo;s behavior compliant, inducing her to conform not
just to behaviors she is observing but to those norms she has
internalized (Hoehl et al. 2019. Essler et al 2023).</p>

<h3 id="NormCognNonh">2.3 Normative Cognition in Nonhuman Animals</h3>

<p>
Overimitation is also noteworthy because it may be distinctively
human. For example, although chimpanzees imitate the way conspecifics
instrumentally manipulate their environment to achieve a goal, they
will copy the behavior only selectively, skipping steps which they
recognize as unnecessary (Whiten et al. 2009, also see Clay &amp;
Tennie 2018 for similar results with bonobos). Evidence suggests that
learning in human children is comparatively more attuned to peer
influence in other ways as well. Once chimpanzees and orangutans have
figured out how to solve a problem, they are conservative, sticking to
whatever solution they learn first. Humans, in contrast, will often
switch to a new solution that is demonstrated by peers, sometimes even
switching to <em>less</em> effective strategies under peer influence
(Haun, Rekers, &amp; Tomasello 2014). However, other researchers have
recently contested the claim that overimitation is strictly absent in
non-humans (Andrews 2017; Allen &amp; Andrews 2024).</p>

<p>
Beyond questions about overimitation specifically, there is an
increasingly lively debate about animal normativity, which includes
questions about whether a psychological capacity dedicated to
<em>norms</em> is distinctively human or whether some of the
mechanisms that underpin it might be present in rudimentary form in
other animals. For example, some researchers have interpreted
chimpanzees&rsquo; behavioral responses to aggression and violence
towards infants as evidence of rules surrounding the proper treatment
of infants and a prohibition against infanticide (Sakamaki et al.
2001; Rudolf von Rohr et al. 2011). Play fighting behaviors in
chimpanzees and canids has also been described as involving a series
of rules and conventions aimed at preventing an outbreak of genuine
violence, such as play bows and play panting (Bekoff 2001; Matsusaka
2004). Others have drawn parallels between norm-governed hierarchies
in human societies and the strict dominance hierarchies in chimpanzee
communities (de Waal 2014). Along these lines, Nishida et al. (1995)
describe an evocative incident in which an individual male chimpanzee
was violently attacked by higher-ranking males and females and
ultimately ostracized for failing to show proper deference to
higher-ranking males. There is also suggestive evidence of
&ldquo;cultural traditions&rdquo; that vary in surprising ways across
wild chimpanzee groups in the same region. While some chimpanzee
groups in the Ta&iuml; Forest of C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire use stone
tools to crack nuts, immediately adjacent groups use wooden tools for
the same purpose. Interestingly, when immigrant females move between
these groups, they reliably adopt the tool-use behaviors of their new
group, even when these new tools are less efficient than those of
their previous group (Luncz &amp; Boesch 2014). Other potential
&ldquo;cultural traditions&rdquo; in captive chimpanzee populations
include a distinctive cross-armed walk behavior and a &ldquo;fashion
trend&rdquo; where chimpanzees would keep stalks of grass in their
ears for no apparent purpose. In both cases, these trends were
initiated by a dominant female and then emulated by other members of
the group.</p>

<p>
Despite these suggestive examples, there is considerable skepticism
about whether such behaviors constitute evidence for genuinely
<em>normative</em> cognition in chimpanzees. Some doubt that
chimpanzees&rsquo; behaviors are really driven by mental
representations that take the form of <em>rules</em>, or whether they
are merely acting in ways that happen to accord with some hypothetical
rule (Schlingloff &amp; Moore 2017). Another source of skepticism
comes from a lack of evidence that chimpanzees engage in third-party
punishment of norm violations, even in controlled experimental
paradigms (Riedl et al. 2012; Prooijen 2018; Powell 2023; though see
Suchak et al. 2016). Doubt also stems from broader theoretical
considerations about the human uniqueness of the cognitive
prerequisites for normative cognition. For example, gene-culture
coevolutionary theories posit a dedicated psychological capacity for
norms as a key mechanism of human&rsquo;s uniquely sophisticated forms
of cultural evolution and ultrasociality, and a major ingredient of
&ldquo;the secret of our success&rdquo; (Richerson and Boyd 2005,
Henrich 2015). Likewise, Michael Tomasello has suggested that the
psychological capacity for normative cognition stems from a more basic
capacity for shared intentionality, which he also holds is found only
in humans (Tomasello 2019b, 2020). Bicchieri&rsquo;s (2006; 2016)
account of social norms (a technical term in her theory) requires that
individuals have the capacity to represent other agents&rsquo;
beliefs, another capacity thought to be uniquely human (but see
Krupenye et al. 2016).</p>

<p>
Proponents of the claim that animals display some form of normative
cognition have responded to these critiques in several ways. One
strategy has been to argue that nonhuman animals do in fact possess
the psychological prerequisites for normative cognition, and that the
evidence is less equivocal than critics might suggest (Fitzpatrick
2020). Another argues for weaker and more graded conceptions of
normative cognition that are more plausibly attributed to nonhuman
animals like chimpanzees (Rudolf von Rohr, 2011; Vincent, Ring, &amp;
Andrews, 2018; Andrews 2020; Andrews, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Westra 2024).
Andrews, for instance, proposes four cognitive capacities that are
widespread in nonhuman animals and argues that they are jointly
sufficient for normative cognition: &ldquo;(1) the ability to identify
agents, (2) sensitivity to in-group/out-group differences, (3) the
capacity for social learning of group traditions, and (4)
responsiveness to appropriateness&rdquo; (Andrews 2020, 37).</p>

<p>
Another approach (which borrows from methodological advances in the
study of animal culture (Whiten 2019; Heyes 2020) has been to argue
for a more behavioral conception of norms themselves. This approach
construes the initial explanatory target of a theory of normative
cognition as a pattern that emerges from certain kinds of social
interactions. This has the advantage of making the key phenomenon,
that which different accounts of normative cognition are posited to
explain, more amenable to empirical observation. It also allows
theorists to remain neutral (at least at first) about the exact
character of the cognitive and motivational mechanisms that allow
organisms to participate in those patterns of interactions. For
example, Westra and colleagues introduce the terminology of
&ldquo;normative regularities&rdquo; to characterize <em>socially
maintained patterns of conformity within a community</em>, where
&ldquo;socially maintained&rdquo; refers to processes of social
enforcement. If norms are understood first and foremost as normative
regularities (as opposed to, say, mentally represented rules), then
they are a category of behavioral regularity picked out by its diffuse
but still perceivable characteristics. Thus a social pattern will
qualify as a norm independently of anything about the psychology of
the individual organisms that participate in it. Different instances
of normative regularities might then be supported by, and thus
explained by appeal to, the operation of different kinds of cognitive
and motivational mechanisms, some of which use rule-like mental
representations but also others that don&rsquo;t (Westra and Andrews
2022; Westra et al. 2024; Andrews, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Westra 2024).
Proponents of this approach argue that it has the advantage of making
room for a pluralistic conception of normative cognition, where norms
may emerge in different populations and across different species as
the result of social interactions driven by a range of different, and
more or less sophisticated, psychological processes (Westra and
Andrews 2022). It also shifts the emphasis of comparative research on
animal normativity away from specific cognitive capacities and towards
more observational methods for ascertaining the presence or absence of
norms in nonhuman animal communities.</p>

<h3 id="ThirPuniNorm">2.4 Third-party Punishment and Normative Cognition</h3>

<p>
Another recent focal point of empirical research on norms is
enforcement, and the social and psychological processes that
incentivize norm compliance (Schmidt and Tomasello 2012).
Historically, norm enforcement has been thought of mostly in terms of
punishment and the disposition to sanction norm violations. This line
of thought has its roots in theories of the evolution of human
cooperation, especially cooperation within large groups of genetically
unrelated individuals. Cooperation is puzzling from an evolutionary
perspective in general, and this form presents distinctive challenges
that are not easily met by kin or reciprocity based altruism. Large
groups of genetically unrelated individuals appear to provide ripe
conditions for free-riding individuals to take advantage of the
cooperative efforts of others, thereby subverting the cooperative
efforts of the group. If free-riders are reliably punished, however,
this creates a dynamic wherein free-riding becomes more costly than
cooperation (Sober and Wilson 1998). In game theoretic models, if
enough members of a group are inclined to punish free-riders,
cooperative norms can be stabilized across the group, even if engaging
in sanctioning behavior is costly to both the individual being
sanctioned <em>and</em> the sanctioner (Axelrod 1986; Boyd &amp;
Richerson 1992). This kind of punishment is widely believed to have
been critical to the evolution of human cooperation on large scales
(Price et al. 2002, Mathew &amp; Boyd 2011, Mathew et al. 2013).</p>

<p>
Notably, while these proposals were originally introduced to explain
the stabilization of cooperation, a classic paper showed that the same
punitive dynamics can in theory stabilize conformity to any behavioral
norm whatsoever, even costly and maladaptive ones (Boyd &amp;
Richerson 1992). This fact can help explain cases of costly conformity
to arbitrary norms, depicting them as by-products of the same
evolutionary forces that drove the emergence of large-scale
cooperation. When paired with social learning heuristics such as
conformity and prestige biases, as well as a general sensitivity to
markers of tribal boundaries (McElreath, Boyd, &amp; Richerson 2003),
this hypothesized disposition to punish would have functioned as a key
psychological mechanism in the cultural evolution of group-specific
norms (Chudek &amp; Henrich 2011). Moreover, many who take a
cognitive-evolutionary approach to normative cognition further
hypothesize that this disposition to punish norm violations is a key
element of our normative cognition.</p>

<p>
Some of the best-known evidence for this idea comes from results in
behavioral economics showing that individuals will routinely punish
others even at a cost to themselves (Fehr &amp; Gachter 2002; J.
Henrich, McElreath, et al. 2006). For example, in public goods games
participants are given a non-trivial sum of money and must decide if
and how much to contribute to a common pool over the course of several
rounds. How much each investment pays off depends on how much everyone
collectively contributes that round, so each participant&rsquo;s
decisions should factor in the past and expected behavior of every
other participant. In some versions, participants can also spend their
money to punish others, based on knowledge of the contributions they
have made. Results indicate that some participants are willing to
engage in so-called &ldquo;altruistic punishment&rdquo;, incurring a
cost to themselves in order to sanction low contributors (Fehr &amp;
Gachter 2002). Neuroimaging results indicate that engaging in this
form of altruistic punishment tended to activate the brain&rsquo;s
reward circuitry (de Quervain et al. 2004; Strobel et al. 2011).</p>

<p>
Another noteworthy aspect of punitive behavior revealed by behavioral
economic experiments is that humans are willing to punish even when
they are mere bystanders to the incident that they are responding to.
In such cases of <em>third-party punishment</em>, an individual
enforces a norm despite the fact that she is neither the
offend<em>er</em> who commits the violation, nor the offend<em>ed</em>
who was wronged, the victim affected by the transgression (Fehr &amp;
Fischbacher 2004; Strobel et al. 2011; though see Bone, Silva, &amp;
Raihani 2014). Such interventions can appear initially puzzling from
an evolutionary standpoint, but third-party punishment can also
function as a social signal, a costly and thus credible way for the
punisher to indicate to others that they are trustworthy and concerned
with the community&rsquo;s rules (Gintis, Smith, &amp; Bowles 2001).
Punishers can thus reap reputational benefits that might exceed
whatever it cost them to intervene (Jordan, Hoffman, Bloom, &amp; Rand
2016).</p>

<p>
However, other researchers have challenged the view that punishment as
such is central to normative cognition, or even to the psychology of
norm enforcement. Some of this skepticism comes from the fact that
evidence of people administering direct, confrontational punishment
outside of heavily circumscribed experimental paradigms has been
difficult to find. For example, in studies that ask participants to
record their responses to norm violations in their daily lives, people
rarely report engaging in direct, confrontational forms of punishment.
Instead, they tend to respond in more indirect ways, like gossiping
about the norm violator, or simply avoiding them (Balafoutas et al.,
2014; Molho et al. 2020). On those rare occasions where someone did
take direct, confrontational action, the punisher&rsquo;s self
interest was often at stake: people tend to confront norm violators
when they value the welfare of the victim (Pedersen et al. 2018;
2020), or when they are simply retaliating because they themselves are
the victim of the transgression (Molho et al., 2020). A number of
ethnographic studies have also found third-party punishments to be
rare in small-scale societies (Black 2000; Wiessner 2020; Fitouchi
&amp; Singh, 2023). Even in behavioral economics experiments, which
have yielded evidence of third-party punishments in Western
populations, there is considerable variability in punitive responses
across cultures (Henrich et al. 2006; Herrmann et al. 2008).
Meanwhile, other lab-based studies have found that given the option,
third parties actually prefer positive over negative forms of
enforcement, rewarding norm conformers rather than punishing norm
violators (Chavez &amp; Bicchieri, 2013; Jordan &amp; Kouchaki, 2021).
Observers also tend to approve of helping victims of norm violations,
and to evaluate third-party helpers more highly than third-party
punishers (Raihani &amp; Bsharry 2015; Jordan, Hoffman, Bloom, &amp;
Rand 2016; Dhaliwal et al. 2021).</p>

<p>
These latter findings raise questions about the existence of a
generalized disposition to directly sanction norm violations and the
role it might play in the psychology of norm enforcement. The
prevalence in daily life of less costly, more indirect responses to
norm violations suggests that many norms are maintained in other ways
besides this kind of punishment. One idea, suggested by new modeling
techniques that treat the distribution of norms present in a
population as varying continuously rather than discreetly, is that in
addition to propensities to imitate others and punish norm violators,
moral preferences may be required to sustain cooperative norms within
a community (Yan et al. 2023). Another possibility is that gossip is a
key mechanism of enforcement and thus plays a significant role in
stabilizing norms. Communities collectively discuss and share
information about the past deeds and social tendencies of their
members. In doing so, they create an incentive structure that
typically motivates people to comply with group norms: adhering to
those norms will garner a good name and social rewards, while breaking
the rules will incur reputational damage and potentially more extreme
consequences like social ostracization (Baumard, Andr&eacute;, &amp;
Sperber 2013). Norm adherence may also be positively incentivized
through the social benefits that come with belonging: conformity to
cooperative norms can yield not only the benefits of cooperation but
may also feel good and serve as a signal of trustworthiness (Jordan et
al. 2016). Conformity to even arbitrary norms can signal an
individual&rsquo;s status as an ingroup member and thus as viable
partner (McElreath, Boyd, &amp; Richerson 2003). In short, norm
enforcement may be the product of a number of different social
processes grounded in a variety of psychological mechanisms (Westra
&amp; Andrews, 2022).</p>

<p>
Consistent with this perspective on norm enforcement is the idea that
whether or not human normative cognition contains a strong disposition
to punish, those behaviors that serve to enforce and stabilize norms,
like nearly all human behaviors, are themselves likely to be heavily
regulated by norms (Boyd et al. 2010, Bowles et al. 2012.). Norms that
coordinate enforcement are also likely to exhibit cultural variation.
One suggestion along these lines is that some norms of third-party
punishment originally evolved in small-scale societies as a means of
managing within-group conflict and restoring cooperative equilibria:
episodes of norm enforcement serve as a deterrent to norm violators
but also as a means of making restitution for victims of norm
violations (Wiessner 2020; Fitouchi and Singh 2023). From this
perspective, third-party punishment does not so much function as a
basic mechanism of norm enforcement, but rather as a communal tool for
restoring norms when they break down (Gao et al. 2015). Meanwhile,
Wylie and Gantman (2024) argue that in societies with formalized
institutions, third-party punishment is much more prevalent in
response to violations of rules that have been explicitly codified by
institutions with formal sanctioning authority, whereas informal or
implicit norms are primarily enforced through indirect social
sanctions, such as gossip. They also suggest that in the former
contexts, third-party punishments of codified rule violations are
often motivated by the goal of domination, and that in practice they
serve to reify existing social hierarchies.</p>

<p>
Proposals like these contain challenges to received views, and raise
important and unanswered questions about the idea that normative
cognition contains a core disposition to punish norm violators, about
the range of forms that norm enforcement can take, and about the
social function (or functions) of third-party punishment.</p>

<h2 id="NormCognMora">3. Normative Cognition and Morality</h2>

<p>
Norms are relevant to areas of research across philosophy, the
humanities, and the behavioral sciences, and the kinds of
cognitive-evolutionary accounts of norm psychology described here have
the potential to inform and enrich many of them (see e.g. Bell
forthcoming on transgender experience). The most immediate
implications would seem to fall within the domain of moral theory.</p>

<h3 id="NormCognPsyc">3.1 Normative Cognition and Moral Psychology</h3>

<p>
Moral psychology has emerged as a thriving interdisciplinary area of
study in the last few decades (see Sinnott-Armstrong 2008a,b,c; Doris
et al 2010, 2020; Alfano, Loeb, &amp; Plakias 2018; Vargas and Doris
2022). While the investigation of normative cognition is a key part of
its subject matter, norm psychology and moral psychology are
categories that appear to crosscut each other. The study of moral
psychology outstrips research on normative cognition to include work
on the psychology of altruism, well-being, character and virtue, moral
emotions, intentional versus unintentional action, and so forth. Our
normative cognition also appears to readily handle norms beyond those
that are paradigmatically moral; typical examples include conventional
norms, etiquette norms, epistemic norms, aesthetic norms, etc.</p>

<p>
However, the relationship of norms and norm psychology to morality and
moral psychology is itself a subject of philosophical debate, as the
status of the category of morality itself remains unclear (Machery
2012). The quest to delimit the boundaries of the moral domain, and to
distinguish the genuinely moral from non-moral norms, has a long
history, but has yet to produce a view that is widely accepted (Stich
2018). For example, some researchers argue on empirical grounds that
there are proximate psychological differences that can be used to
distinguish a set of moral rules distinct from other types, e.g.
conventional, prudential, etiquette. According to one prominent
account rooted in developmental psychology, moral rules are marked by
the fact that individuals judge them to hold generally rather than
only locally, to apply independently of the pronouncement of any
authority figure, and to govern matters concerning harm, welfare,
justice, and rights (Turiel 1983, Smetana 1993, Nucci 2001, also see
Machery and Stich 2022). Some have drawn inspiration from the
sentimentalist tradition in moral theory to build on this account,
explaining the features posited as distinctive of moral rules by
appeal to their connection to emotions like anger or disgust (Nichols
2004; cf. Haidt 2001). Others have contested this characterization of
moral norms, marshalling arguments and evidence that it is not
psychologically universal, but is rather found only in certain
cultures (Kelly et al. 2007; Kelly &amp; Stich 2007, also see
Berni&#363;nas, Dranseika, &amp; Sousa, 2016; Berni&#363;nas, Silius,
&amp; Dranseika, 2020; cf. Kumar 2015; Heath 2017).</p>

<p>
More generally, while some theorists hold that our species possesses
an evolved psychological system dedicated specifically to morality
(Joyce 2007; Mameli 2013; Stanford 2018; cf. Kitcher 2011), others
remain skeptical. They argue instead that the evidence better supports
the view that humans have an evolved psychological system dedicated to
norms in general, but there is nothing about the mechanisms that
underlie it, the adaptive pressures that selected for it, or the norms
that it can come to contain that would support a distinction between
moral norms and non-moral norms (Machery &amp; Mallon 2010; Davis
&amp; Kelly 2018; Stich 2020). On this view, rather, human norm
psychology evolved to be able to deal with, and can still acquire and
internalize, a wide range of norms, epistemic, aesthetic, sartorial,
religious, etiquette, as well as norms that might be classified by a
contemporary Westerner as moral. Indeed, this view of norm psychology
has been taken to support a historicist view of morality itself,
according to which the practice of distinguishing some subset of norms
and normative judgments as moral, and thus as possessing special
status or authority, is a culturally parochial and relatively recent
historical invention (Machery 2018). This suggestion can seem
implausible, even jarring upon first encounter. But there are other
lines of nearby research suggesting that seemingly bedrock features of
social life and categories that are foundational to Western
sensibilities may also be relatively recent, local developments. For
example, it might seem straightforward that when judging a
person&rsquo;s action&mdash;whether it is right or wrong, how much
responsibility the person bears, how much blame or praise it
merits&mdash;the person&rsquo;s intentions and motivations are
relevant, and should factor heavily into such judgments. However,
evidence suggests that this focus on inner mental states is
considerably less prominent in the way normative judgments are
typically made in many cultures (Barrett et al 2016, McNamara et al
2019, Curtin et al 2020, Barrett &amp; Saxe 2021).</p>

<h3 id="NormCognPhil">3.2 Normative Cognition and Moral Philosophy</h3>

<p>
Caveats in place, several debates with broadly moral subject matter
have already begun drawing on empirically inspired accounts of norm
psychology. Some have argued that cultural variation in norms and
persistent disputes over right and wrong have significant implications
for metaethics. The &ldquo;argument from disagreement&rdquo; (Loeb
1998) holds that if dispute over the permissibility of some activity
or practice persists even after reasoning errors and non-moral factual
disagreements have been resolved, such intractable disagreement would
militate against moral realism (Mackie 1977). Empirically establishing
the existence of persistent disagreement is difficult (Doris &amp;
Plakias 2008), but the character of the norm system and its influence
on judgment may speak to whether or not it is likely. Consider two
individuals from different cultures, who have internalized divergent
families of norms (individualistic and collectivist, honor based and
shame based, divinity and autonomy, tight and loose, etc.) Such
individuals are likely to disagree about the permissibility of a range
of activities and practices, such as what counts as a fair division of
resources, or whether people should get to choose who they marry, or
what is and is not an appropriate way to respond to an insult. This
disagreement may very well endure even in the face of agreement about
the non-moral facts of the matter, and even when neither side of the
dispute is being partial or making any reasoning errors. Such
persistent disagreement may be explainable by appeal to differences in
the individual&rsquo;s respective norm systems, and to the different
norms each has internalized from their culture (Machery et al. 2005).
Empirical details of the operational principles of normative
cognition&mdash;especially knowing whether and the extent to which it
is automatic, non-conscious, recalcitrant and insensitive to other
psychological processes&mdash;can help assess the plausibility of this
argument.</p>

<p>
Philosophers concerned with moral progress have also begun to explore
the relevance of empirical work on normative cognition. On one
prominent view, recent moral progress is thought to have come largely
in the form of expansions of the moral circle, the spread of inclusive
norms, and the demoralization of invalid ones (Singer 1981; Buchanan
&amp; Powell 2018; cf. Sauer 2019, 2023.) Much attention has focused
on understanding changes in the distribution of norms that occur as
the result of <em>reasoning</em> about norms (Campbell &amp; Kumar
2012, Kumar &amp; Campbell 2022), though some remain skeptical that
much is known about the role of reasoning (Rehren &amp; Blunden 2024).
Others hold that social change, including instances in the direction
of moral progress, mostly occurs as the result of myopic, though not
fully blind, processes of cultural evolution (Kling 2016; Brownstein
&amp; Kelly 2019; Gaus 2021). Advances in the empirical accounts of
the cultural transmission of norms, and of the relationships of
normative cognition to rationalization, critical reasoning, and
explicit argumentation promise to further illuminate these dynamics
(Summers 2017; Mercier &amp; Sperber 2017). For example, further
investigation into the ways our norm psychology is likely to produce a
kneejerk resistance to social change of any kind&mdash;progressive,
regressive, or otherwise&mdash;could yield useful insights about how
such resistance might be anticipated and overcome (Kelly &amp; Westra
2024).</p>

<p>
More and more philosophers are taking an interest in social change
more generally, and many of the emerging conversations have assumed
the shape of venerable and long-standing debates between
individualists and structuralists. This common pattern of discussion
makes central the question of whether social changes are best
explained (injustices best addressed, moral progress best achieved,
etc.) by focusing attention on individual people and their
psychological characteristics, on the one hand, or on features of the
institutions and social structures that they inhabit, on the other
(see e.g. Haslanger 2015, Beeghly &amp; Holroyd 2020, also see Chater
&amp; Loewenstein 2023). Some have resisted this way of framing the
issues, however, explicitly arguing that it is confused and
ineffective (Madva 2016, Brownstein, Kelly, &amp; Madva 2022, Madva,
Brownstein, &amp; Kelly 2023). In its place, they advocate for the
development of an interactionist approach that gives equal priority to
both individuals and structures, and replaces &ldquo;either/or&rdquo;
with &ldquo;both/and&rdquo; thinking (see Brownstein, Madva, &amp;
Kelly forthcoming for a book length discussion).</p>

<p>
Recent integrative work by philosophers along these lines has focused
on specific features of our psychology that are relevant to social
change and responsive to cultural influence, such as memory (Soon
2020) and social scripts (Eickers 2024, Hesni 2024). Many of these
appeal to norms (Ayala-L&oacute;pez 2018, Berio &amp; Musholt 2023),
and researchers across the social sciences are exploring ways to
harness different aspects of norm psychology and its
descriptive-to-prescriptive tendency (mentioned in section 2.2) to
advance a variety of social changes (Tankard &amp; Paluck 2016, Nyborg
et al 2016, Sparkman &amp; Walton 2017; Davis, Hennes, &amp; Raymond
2018; Raymond, Kelly, &amp; Hennes 2021). Others put empirical work on
normative cognition itself center stage, explicitly arguing that it
shows how norms are fundamental ingredients of the social fabric,
serving as a connective tissue that weaves individuals and soft social
structures together (Davidson &amp; Kelly 2020). Understood this way,
norms are both part of our individual minds and part of the social
structures we live in.</p>
